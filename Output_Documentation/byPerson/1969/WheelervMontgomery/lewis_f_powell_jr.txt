justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
of--
suppose
a
pension
has
been
granted
or
receipt
or
whatever
you
call
it,
and
the
congress
or
the
legislature
wants
to
repeat
it.
is
it
your
position
that
the
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
has
that
ever--
question
ever
been
tested
with
reference
to
any
pension,
revolution
war
pension,
civil
war
pension,
spanish-american
pension,
or
the
first
and
second
world
war
pension?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
your
position
that
a
pension
cannot
be
cut
off
where
once
it’s
been
decided
that
a
man
gets
a
pension
without
giving
him
some
kind
of
hearing
before
it’s
cut
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
the
pension?
just
the
pension,
just
granted
because
he
was
in
the
army--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course
the
government
doesn’t
have
to
grant
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i’d
like
the
answer
to
be
clear
about
this
part
of
your
argument.
is
it
your
position
that
when
congress
or
a
state
enacts
a
gratuity
piece
of
legislation,
giving
somebody
something
out
of
the
treasury
and
declares
that
issue
be
found
eligible
by
agencies,
that
they
can
never
be
declared
ineligible
without
going
through
a
tri--
a
type
of
trial
procedure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
then
i
guess--
maybe
i’m--
my
question
was
right.
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
answer.
is
it
your
position
that
when
there’s
a
gratuity
given,
such
as
has
been
given
in
many
wars,
after
many
wars,
bread,
meat,
gratuity
of
various
kind,
somebody
is
found
eligible
by
an
agency,
that
the
government
cannot
deprive
that
person
of
that
gratuity
without
going
through
a
trial
type
procedure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i’m
saying
you
say
they
have
to
have
notice
before
the--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
government
cut
it
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
after
the
civil
war,
there
were
large
numbers
of
gratuity
given
in
this
country
of
food
and
meat
and
raiment
of
various
kinds.
was
there
any
show--
any
case
record
involved
in
that
gross
gratuities?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
has
there
ever
been
one
before
with
reference
to
gratuity
where
it
has
been
insisted
that
a
pure
gratuity,
a
man
has
such
a
right
to
it
after
he
once
gets
it,
that
he
must
have
notice
before
the
government
cuts
it
off?
has
it
ever
been
directly
held
and,
if
so,
when?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
the
wel--
this
statute
and
on
any
statute
in
the
history
of
the
government.
justice

f.
powell,

was
that?

lewis
f.

and
what
court
was
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
held
to
cut
him
off
from
land
that
he
had
been
legally
held
on,
didn’t
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
found
that
he
legally
own
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
county
was
that
you
said
had
had
a
