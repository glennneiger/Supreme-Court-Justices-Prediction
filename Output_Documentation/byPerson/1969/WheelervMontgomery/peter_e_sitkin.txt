mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
e.
sitkin.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
case
involves
the
question
of
what
procedural
rights
are
to
be
afforded
to
the
most
dependent
members
of
our
society:
the
aged,
the
disabled,
the
blind,
and
the
children
of
the
poor.
the
basic
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
welfare
recipients,
after
being
found
eligible,
after
full
and
vigorous
investigation,
are
to
have
their
benefits
terminated
without
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
adjudicative
hearing.
in
california,
at
the
present
time,
there
is
a
hearing
which
comports
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
after
the
termination
of
welfare
benefits.
under
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
this
hearing
takes
place--
should
take
place
within
60
days
from
the
date
of
termination
of
benefits.
in
point
of
fact,
the
hearing
takes
place
long
after
that
60-day
period,
as
has
been
conceded
by
appellees
of
this
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is.
the
appellants
who
i’m
representing
specifically
are
old
age
security
recipients
who
are
recipients
under
the
categorical
aid
program
funded
by
the
social
security
act.
the
regulation
at
issue
in
this
case
concerns
all
of
the
categorical
aid
programs,
that
is,
the
aid
to
families
with
independent
children,
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
disabled,
as
well
as
old
age
security.
prior
to
termination
of
benefits,
a
welfare
recipient
is
not
afforded
an
adjudicative
hearing
to
contest
the
reasons
upon
which
the
department
has
based
its
decision
to
terminate.
a
welfare
recipient
is
only
provided
with
an
opportunity
to
confer
informally,
usually
with
the
very
individual
who
has
made
the
initial
decision
to
terminate
at
a
conference
which
can
take
place
at
a
minimum
of
three
days
before
a
check
will
be
terminated
or
a
check
will
be
withheld.
there
is
no
opportunity
within
this
short
period
of
time
to
adequately
prepare
for
this
conference,
nor
is
there
an
opportunity
at
the
conference
to
have
an
opportunity
to
fairly
and
fully
adjudicate
the
questions
which
might
involve
continuing
eligibility.
questions,
for
example,
such
as
whether
an
individual
has
intended
to
transfer
property
to
remain
on
public
assistance,
questions
which
are
traditionally
been
decided
in
adjudicative
hearings
with
the
procedural
protections
usually
connected
with
such
hearings.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
there
is
no
trial
type
hearing
prior
to
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
an
individual
applies
to
the
welfare
department
and
information
is
provided
by
that
individual.
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
indicate
that
the
recipient
himself
is
to
be
the
primary
source
of
the
information
regarding
his
eligibility.
the
department
obtains
consents
from
the
individual
and,
if
necessary,
investigates
the
individual’s
eligibility
by
contacting
collateral
sources
with
respect
to
the
income
that
the
individual
might
have
or
with
respect
to
other
particulars
that
concern
his
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
for
an
individual
who’s
applying
for
assistance.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
an
individual
who
has
already
been
found
eligible
prior
to
the
withholding
of
those
benefits
should
be
afforded
an
opportunity--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
right.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
hearing.
there
is
a
full
investigation
with
respect
to
the
individual
and,
i
might
add,
that
as
an
individual
remains
on
public
assistance,
he
is
periodically
reinvestigated
and
is
required
to
provide
the
department
with
information
to
maintain
his
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
initially?
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
county
welfare
department
in
the
particular--
in
california,
the
welfare
programs
are
administered
locally
by
county
welfare
departments,
although
the
overall
supervision
of
the
program
rests
with
the
state
department
of
social
welfare,
but
it
is
the
individual
county
welfare
department,
usually
in
the
person
of
the
social
worker
or
the
social
work
supervisor
who
initially
approves
the
application
for
eligibility.
if
there
is
a
dispute
with
respect
to
eligibility,
the
individual
is
afforded
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
contest
the
reasons
why
the
department
has
refused
to
grant
assistance
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
that
is
a
trial
type
hearing.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
once
a
person
is
found
eligible
for
public
assistance,
if
he
is
not
afforded
opportunity
to
be
heard
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
discontinuance,
then
his
rights
in
the
due
process
clause
would
be
violated
since
he
is
not
being
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
contest
the
very
reasons
upon
which
the
governmental
agency
has
made
its
decision
to
terminate
benefit.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
at
the
time
that
the
individual
applied
for
aid,
he
did
meet
the
qualifications
for
the
program.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
there
would
be
no
need
in--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
would
only
have
been
a
trial
type
procedure
if
the
welfare
department
had
initially
found
the
individual
to
be
ineligible
and
then
he
took
an
appeal
from
that
initial
determination.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
trial
type
procedure
when
an
individual
applies
to
welfare.
when
he--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that
is
our
position.
unless
an
individual
is
able
to
convince
the
very
individual
who
made
the
initial
determination
that
a
person
is
ineligible,
unless
he
is
able
to
convince
that
person
that
this
informal
conference
held,
as
i
mentioned,
three
days
prior
to
the
date
that
it
should
be
held,
he
has
no
opportunity
to
have
his
aid
continue
until
the
state
administrative
hearing
is
provided
at
least
60
days
after
the
termination
of
his
benefits.
in
determining
the
extent
to
which
procedural
protection
should
be
afforded
to
a
welfare
recipient,
this
court
in
numerous
occasions
has
indicated
that
one
must
examine
the
system
in
which
the
procedural
protections
will
operate,
examine
the
interest
of
the
individual
concerned,
and
examine
the
interest
of
the
state
or
the
governmental
agency
involved.
the
one
overwhelming
and
unique
factor
which
is
present
in
the
welfare
programs,
which
is
present
in
no
other
government
program
is
that
maintenance
of
the
welfare
grant
is
the
difference
between
survival,
between
starvation
and
continuation
of
some
type
of
sustenance.
it
is
this
fundamental
interest
on
the
part
of
the
individual
that,
we
assert,
must
be
protected
by
those
procedures
which
this
court
has
considered
to
be
appropriate
in
adjudicative
hearings.
protections
such
as
the
right
to
cross-examine
and
confront
where
appropriate,
the
opportunity
to
have
a
decision
made
by
at
least
a
relatively
impartial
arbiter,
not
the
very
individual
who
made
the
initial
determination,
to
withhold
benefits,
that
an
individual
be
afforded
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prepare
for
the
hearing,
a
hearing
which
might,
in
the
many
instances,
involve
the
preparation
of
some
interpretation.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
mrs.
wheeler,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mrs.
wheeler
had
to
submit
one
or
two
affidavits
to
the
welfare
department.
this
would
take
some
time.
she’s
given
just
a
three-day
period.
she
must,
in
many
instances,
retain
a
representative
or
counsel.
mrs.
wheeler
was
77
years
of
age
when
her
benefits
were
terminated
and
did
need
the
assistance,
first,
of
a
lay
representative
and,
ultimately,
of
an
attorney.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that
is
the
basic
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
hearing
is
ultimately
given,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
given
the
injury
that
occurs
to
an
individual
when
benefits
are
withdrawn,
that
in
those
relatively
few
cases,
and
i
underscore
that,
the
relatively
few
cases
where
the
question
of
ineligibility
is
contested,
an
individual
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
this
type
of
hearing
prior
to
the
withdrawal
of
benefits.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
hearing
procedure
which
is
going
to
be
available
for
all
one
million
welfare
recipients
in
california
nor
the
23,000
old
aged
security
recipients
who
have
been
discontinued
from
assistance,
for
the
figures
bear
out
that
it
is
a
relatively
few
number
of
welfare
recipients
that
appeal
the
determination
of
the
welfare
department.
in
many
instances,
there
is
agreement.
an
individual
obtains
employment
and
is
no
longer
eligible
for
assistance.
his
income
now
exceeds
the
welfare
limitations.
in
another
instance,
an
individual
may
have
remarried
and
may
no
longer
be
in
need
of
additional
public
assistance.
so
that,
we
are
only
concerned
about
those
issues
we
are--
those
situations
where
serious
questions
of
fact
have
arisen
between
the
welfare
recipient
and
the
county
welfare
department,
and
it
is
to
that
issue
that
we
search
an
adjudicative
hearing
having
basic
protections
is
necessary.
we--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that--
if
that
administrative
decision
was
made
by
the
state
of
california
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
appellants
in
this
case.
the
problem
about--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
if
in
fact
california
was
adhering
to
the
60-day
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
if--
you’re
saying
that
if
we
lose
in
the
first
instance
and
we
win
in
the
second
instance
and
then
we
get
retroactive
benefits,
that
is
not
sufficient
to
fully
make
whole,
if
you
will,
the
individuals
who
were
terminated
from
assistance.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
a
case
decided
last
term,
in
nash
versus
the
florida
industrial
welfare
commission,
the
fact
that
an
individual
ultimately
can
recoup
through
retroactive
payments
is
not
a
satisfactory
answer
when
the
funds
are
necessary
to
provide
the
difference
between
continuing
subsistence
and
possible
starvation.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
case
was
the
case
in
florida
where
an
individual
was
when
the
florida
law
precluded--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
nash
versus
florida
industrial
commission.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
citation
to
the
case
is
389
us
235.
in
addition,
if
the
court
would
review
particularly
the
affidavit
of
henry
fraser
which
is
contained
at
the
rec--
in
the
record,
not
in
the
appendix,
in
the
record
at
pages
137
through
140,
the
court
will
graphically
appreciate
the
circumstances
that
individuals
are
placed
when
benefits
are
withheld
even
for
a
period
of
60
days.
in
the
situation
of
a
number
of
the
interveners
in
this
case,
the
individuals
were
reduced
to
a
diet
of
potatoes
to
not
having
the
ability
to
purchase
any
type
of
clothing
and
to
severe
injury,
but
it
must
be
made
plane
that
in
california,
at
the
present
time,
not
even
the
60-day
requirement
is
being
met.
one
would
assume,
however,
that
if
the
hearing
preceded
termination
that
the
60-day
requirement
would
be
met,
indeed,
the
experience
in
a
number
of
states
who
have
instituted
a
continuation
pending
the
hearing
has
resulted
in
a
situation
where
hearing
decisions
are
rendered
within
two
weeks,
so
that
when
there
is
the
additional
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state,
both
to
rapidly
adjudicate
the
decision
so
that
additional
moneys
are
not
paid
out
in
some
instances
to
potentially
ineligible
persons,
the
hearings
are
held
expeditiously
and
rapidly.
this
flexibility
is
available
within
the
administrative
agencies
involved
and
the
individual,
the
recipient,
can
be
afforded
those
rights
which
are
traditionally
associated.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
it
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
an
individual
does
not
have,
we
use
the
term,
“vested
right”
to
the
benefits
which
he
is
be--
receiving,
but
however
we
characterize
that
interest,
it
is
a
substantial
one
and
it
is
an
interest
which
should
not
be
taken
from
an
individual
without
according
that
individual
basic
elements
of
procedural
fairness
and
due
process.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
don’t
believe
that
the
specific
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case
has
been
tested
with
respect
to
the
procedural
rights
that
are
to
be
afforded
individuals,
but
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
that
have
indicated
that
however
one
characterizes
the
interest,
that
government
must
act
in
a
fair
and
reasonable
way
in
the
administration
of
programs
where
basic
interests
are
involved,
whether
one
characterizes
it
as
a
right,
as
a
vested
right,
or
as
a
privilege.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
one--
to
answer
that
question
directly,
one
would
have
to
be
aware
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
pension
was
granted.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
under
those--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
government
does
not
have
to
grant
it
in
the
first
instance,
but
once
it
does
grant
it
and
assuming
that
the
legislation
remains
in
effect,
then
the
individual
should
be
entitled
to
continue
to
receive
that
pension
until
he
is
afford--
unless
there’s
a
determination
which
is
reached
after
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
matter,
the
individual
is
no
longer
eligible
for
that
pension.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
not
at
all.
i’m
not
suggesting
at
all
that
that
legislature
does
not
have
within
its
power
the
right
to
withdraw
the--
any
government
benefit
program.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
once
the
legislation
has
been
passed
and
once
benefits
are
being
provided
to
individuals,
before
specific
individual’s
welfare
assistance
is
removed,
he
should
be
afforded
those
opportunities
which
have
been
afforded
individuals
in
like
circumstances
by
this
court.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
my
position
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
which
ahs
the
basic
elements
of
due
process
before
termination--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
court,
in
the
case
of
green
versus
mcelroy
which,
admittedly,
was
not
a
constitutional
decision
but
spoken
constitutional
terms,
indicated
that
basic
procedural
protections
are
indeed
essential
before
the
right
to--
public
employment
is
withdrawn.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no.
in
cafeteria
workers
it
was
not
made
as
rigid,
but
the
court
clearly
indicated
that
due
process
applied
and,
with
the
analysis
i
suggested
earlier,
should
be
undertaken.
in
that
case,
it
was
felt
that
the
interest
of
the
government
and
national
security
and
the
fact
that
the
individual
involved
in
that
case
was
not
so
substantial
that
procedural
safeguards
of
the
type
we’re
seeking
here
should
be
afforded.
in
that
case,
the
individual
was
only
stopped
from
working
at
one
particular
base.
what
we
have
in
this
particular
situation
is
the
withdrawal
of
the
very
means
of
subsistence
to
an
individual.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
court
has
held
in
cases
where
there
has
not
been
the
overwriting
interest
of
national
security
that
a
public
employee
does
have
an
opportunity
to
be
afforded
an
opportunity
be
heard--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
before
his--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
before
his
benefits
are--
before
his
wages
are
taken.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
as
i
indicated,
in
the
case
of
green
versus
mcelroy--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
in
the
case
of
sloucher
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
the
individual
in
that
particular
case
was
afforded
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
his
wages
were
withdrawn.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
believe
so.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
would
say
that
the
welfare
recipient
is
entitled
to
such
a
hearing.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
regardless
of
what
the
employee
is
entitled
to--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
because,
again,
the
individual
was
on
public
assistance,
really
is
receiving
the
last
public
defense.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
at
all.
our
position
is
that
an
individual
can
be
found
initially
ineligible
by
the
welfare
department,
but
he
must
be
notified
of
that
fact
and,
if
he
contests
that
determination,
then
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
which
affords
him
basic
procedural
safeguards
when
such
a
vital
interest
is
involved.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
if
there
is
an
individual
dispute
regarding
eligibility,
then
the
individual
should
be
afforded
a
hearing.
the
problem
i
have
with
the
question
is
the
term
“trial
type.”
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
we’re
not
asking
for
a
hearing
which
has
all
the--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
right.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
direct
holding
with
respect
to
a
welfare--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there--
in
the
case
of
goldsby
versus
garfield,
which,
was
decided
in
1908--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
goldsby
versus
garfield.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
don’t
have
the
citation.
i
will
attempt
to
furnish
it
to
you.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
it
was
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
it’s
in
the
amicus
brief
in
the
companion
case.
the
citation
to
the
case
is
211
us
249.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
in
that
case,
it
was
a
question
of
the
government
providing
to
individuals
indian
lands,
and
mr.
goldsby
in
that
case
was
initially
found
eligible
for
an
allotment
of
this
land
provided
by
the
federal
government
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
action
of
the
secretary
in
removing
mr.
goldsby
from
the
roles
of
the
individuals
who
were
entitled
to
that
land
without
affording
mr.
goldsby
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
notice
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
that
was
the
issue.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
did,
in
fact,
have
the
right--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
the
court
did
not
find
that
he
did
or
did
not
legally
hold
that
land.
that
was
an
issue
to
be
left
for
the
administrative
determination.
the
court
was
only
dealing
with
whether
the
secretary
could
absent
any
type
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
goldsby
did,
in
fact,
have
proper
title
to
that
land,
whether
he
could
continue
on
the
land.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
i
think
i
will
conclude
at
this
particular
point.
i
would
just
like
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
large
mass
number
of
individuals
who
will
be
continuing
aid.
it
is
only
in
those
situations
where
there
are
serious
issues
of
fact
involved
that
we
are
asserting
that
there
is
a
right
to
continuation
of
assistance
and,
given
the
vital
interest
of
the
individuals
who
were
involved
here
and
given
the
fact
that
administrative
procedures
have
already
been
developed
by
the
state,
it
is
our
position
that
due
process
requires
the
procedural
protections
which
we
assert
are
required
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
e.
sitkin.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
case
involves
the
question
of
what
procedural
rights
are
to
be
afforded
to
the
most
dependent
members
of
our
society:
the
aged,
the
disabled,
the
blind,
and
the
children
of
the
poor.
the
basic
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
welfare
recipients,
after
being
found
eligible,
after
full
and
vigorous
investigation,
are
to
have
their
benefits
terminated
without
an
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
adjudicative
hearing.
in
california,
at
the
present
time,
there
is
a
hearing
which
comports
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
after
the
termination
of
welfare
benefits.
under
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
this
hearing
takes
place--
should
take
place
within
60
days
from
the
date
of
termination
of
benefits.
in
point
of
fact,
the
hearing
takes
place
long
after
that
60-day
period,
as
has
been
conceded
by
appellees
of
this
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is.
the
appellants
who
i’m
representing
specifically
are
old
age
security
recipients
who
are
recipients
under
the
categorical
aid
program
funded
by
the
social
security
act.
the
regulation
at
issue
in
this
case
concerns
all
of
the
categorical
aid
programs,
that
is,
the
aid
to
families
with
independent
children,
aid
to
the
blind,
aid
to
the
disabled,
as
well
as
old
age
security.
prior
to
termination
of
benefits,
a
welfare
recipient
is
not
afforded
an
adjudicative
hearing
to
contest
the
reasons
upon
which
the
department
has
based
its
decision
to
terminate.
a
welfare
recipient
is
only
provided
with
an
opportunity
to
confer
informally,
usually
with
the
very
individual
who
has
made
the
initial
decision
to
terminate
at
a
conference
which
can
take
place
at
a
minimum
of
three
days
before
a
check
will
be
terminated
or
a
check
will
be
withheld.
there
is
no
opportunity
within
this
short
period
of
time
to
adequately
prepare
for
this
conference,
nor
is
there
an
opportunity
at
the
conference
to
have
an
opportunity
to
fairly
and
fully
adjudicate
the
questions
which
might
involve
continuing
eligibility.
questions,
for
example,
such
as
whether
an
individual
has
intended
to
transfer
property
to
remain
on
public
assistance,
questions
which
are
traditionally
been
decided
in
adjudicative
hearings
with
the
procedural
protections
usually
connected
with
such
hearings.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
there
is
no
trial
type
hearing
prior
to
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
an
individual
applies
to
the
welfare
department
and
information
is
provided
by
that
individual.
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
indicate
that
the
recipient
himself
is
to
be
the
primary
source
of
the
information
regarding
his
eligibility.
the
department
obtains
consents
from
the
individual
and,
if
necessary,
investigates
the
individual’s
eligibility
by
contacting
collateral
sources
with
respect
to
the
income
that
the
individual
might
have
or
with
respect
to
other
particulars
that
concern
his
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
for
an
individual
who’s
applying
for
assistance.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
an
individual
who
has
already
been
found
eligible
prior
to
the
withholding
of
those
benefits
should
be
afforded
an
opportunity--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
right.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
hearing.
there
is
a
full
investigation
with
respect
to
the
individual
and,
i
might
add,
that
as
an
individual
remains
on
public
assistance,
he
is
periodically
reinvestigated
and
is
required
to
provide
the
department
with
information
to
maintain
his
eligibility.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
initially?
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
county
welfare
department
in
the
particular--
in
california,
the
welfare
programs
are
administered
locally
by
county
welfare
departments,
although
the
overall
supervision
of
the
program
rests
with
the
state
department
of
social
welfare,
but
it
is
the
individual
county
welfare
department,
usually
in
the
person
of
the
social
worker
or
the
social
work
supervisor
who
initially
approves
the
application
for
eligibility.
if
there
is
a
dispute
with
respect
to
eligibility,
the
individual
is
afforded
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
contest
the
reasons
why
the
department
has
refused
to
grant
assistance
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
that
is
a
trial
type
hearing.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
once
a
person
is
found
eligible
for
public
assistance,
if
he
is
not
afforded
opportunity
to
be
heard
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
discontinuance,
then
his
rights
in
the
due
process
clause
would
be
violated
since
he
is
not
being
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
contest
the
very
reasons
upon
which
the
governmental
agency
has
made
its
decision
to
terminate
benefit.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
at
the
time
that
the
individual
applied
for
aid,
he
did
meet
the
qualifications
for
the
program.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
there
would
be
no
need
in--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
would
only
have
been
a
trial
type
procedure
if
the
welfare
department
had
initially
found
the
individual
to
be
ineligible
and
then
he
took
an
appeal
from
that
initial
determination.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
trial
type
procedure
when
an
individual
applies
to
welfare.
when
he--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that
is
our
position.
unless
an
individual
is
able
to
convince
the
very
individual
who
made
the
initial
determination
that
a
person
is
ineligible,
unless
he
is
able
to
convince
that
person
that
this
informal
conference
held,
as
i
mentioned,
three
days
prior
to
the
date
that
it
should
be
held,
he
has
no
opportunity
to
have
his
aid
continue
until
the
state
administrative
hearing
is
provided
at
least
60
days
after
the
termination
of
his
benefits.
in
determining
the
extent
to
which
procedural
protection
should
be
afforded
to
a
welfare
recipient,
this
court
in
numerous
occasions
has
indicated
that
one
must
examine
the
system
in
which
the
procedural
protections
will
operate,
examine
the
interest
of
the
individual
concerned,
and
examine
the
interest
of
the
state
or
the
governmental
agency
involved.
the
one
overwhelming
and
unique
factor
which
is
present
in
the
welfare
programs,
which
is
present
in
no
other
government
program
is
that
maintenance
of
the
welfare
grant
is
the
difference
between
survival,
between
starvation
and
continuation
of
some
type
of
sustenance.
it
is
this
fundamental
interest
on
the
part
of
the
individual
that,
we
assert,
must
be
protected
by
those
procedures
which
this
court
has
considered
to
be
appropriate
in
adjudicative
hearings.
protections
such
as
the
right
to
cross-examine
and
confront
where
appropriate,
the
opportunity
to
have
a
decision
made
by
at
least
a
relatively
impartial
arbiter,
not
the
very
individual
who
made
the
initial
determination,
to
withhold
benefits,
that
an
individual
be
afforded
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prepare
for
the
hearing,
a
hearing
which
might,
in
the
many
instances,
involve
the
preparation
of
some
interpretation.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
mrs.
wheeler,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mrs.
wheeler
had
to
submit
one
or
two
affidavits
to
the
welfare
department.
this
would
take
some
time.
she’s
given
just
a
three-day
period.
she
must,
in
many
instances,
retain
a
representative
or
counsel.
mrs.
wheeler
was
77
years
of
age
when
her
benefits
were
terminated
and
did
need
the
assistance,
first,
of
a
lay
representative
and,
ultimately,
of
an
attorney.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that
is
the
basic
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
is.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
hearing
is
ultimately
given,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
given
the
injury
that
occurs
to
an
individual
when
benefits
are
withdrawn,
that
in
those
relatively
few
cases,
and
i
underscore
that,
the
relatively
few
cases
where
the
question
of
ineligibility
is
contested,
an
individual
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
this
type
of
hearing
prior
to
the
withdrawal
of
benefits.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
hearing
procedure
which
is
going
to
be
available
for
all
one
million
welfare
recipients
in
california
nor
the
23,000
old
aged
security
recipients
who
have
been
discontinued
from
assistance,
for
the
figures
bear
out
that
it
is
a
relatively
few
number
of
welfare
recipients
that
appeal
the
determination
of
the
welfare
department.
in
many
instances,
there
is
agreement.
an
individual
obtains
employment
and
is
no
longer
eligible
for
assistance.
his
income
now
exceeds
the
welfare
limitations.
in
another
instance,
an
individual
may
have
remarried
and
may
no
longer
be
in
need
of
additional
public
assistance.
so
that,
we
are
only
concerned
about
those
issues
we
are--
those
situations
where
serious
questions
of
fact
have
arisen
between
the
welfare
recipient
and
the
county
welfare
department,
and
it
is
to
that
issue
that
we
search
an
adjudicative
hearing
having
basic
protections
is
necessary.
we--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
that--
if
that
administrative
decision
was
made
by
the
state
of
california
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
appellants
in
this
case.
the
problem
about--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
if
in
fact
california
was
adhering
to
the
60-day
requirement.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
if--
you’re
saying
that
if
we
lose
in
the
first
instance
and
we
win
in
the
second
instance
and
then
we
get
retroactive
benefits,
that
is
not
sufficient
to
fully
make
whole,
if
you
will,
the
individuals
who
were
terminated
from
assistance.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
a
case
decided
last
term,
in
nash
versus
the
florida
industrial
welfare
commission,
the
fact
that
an
individual
ultimately
can
recoup
through
retroactive
payments
is
not
a
satisfactory
answer
when
the
funds
are
necessary
to
provide
the
difference
between
continuing
subsistence
and
possible
starvation.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
case
was
the
case
in
florida
where
an
individual
was
when
the
florida
law
precluded--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
nash
versus
florida
industrial
commission.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
citation
to
the
case
is
389
us
235.
in
addition,
if
the
court
would
review
particularly
the
affidavit
of
henry
fraser
which
is
contained
at
the
rec--
in
the
record,
not
in
the
appendix,
in
the
record
at
pages
137
through
140,
the
court
will
graphically
appreciate
the
circumstances
that
individuals
are
placed
when
benefits
are
withheld
even
for
a
period
of
60
days.
in
the
situation
of
a
number
of
the
interveners
in
this
case,
the
individuals
were
reduced
to
a
diet
of
potatoes
to
not
having
the
ability
to
purchase
any
type
of
clothing
and
to
severe
injury,
but
it
must
be
made
plane
that
in
california,
at
the
present
time,
not
even
the
60-day
requirement
is
being
met.
one
would
assume,
however,
that
if
the
hearing
preceded
termination
that
the
60-day
requirement
would
be
met,
indeed,
the
experience
in
a
number
of
states
who
have
instituted
a
continuation
pending
the
hearing
has
resulted
in
a
situation
where
hearing
decisions
are
rendered
within
two
weeks,
so
that
when
there
is
the
additional
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state,
both
to
rapidly
adjudicate
the
decision
so
that
additional
moneys
are
not
paid
out
in
some
instances
to
potentially
ineligible
persons,
the
hearings
are
held
expeditiously
and
rapidly.
this
flexibility
is
available
within
the
administrative
agencies
involved
and
the
individual,
the
recipient,
can
be
afforded
those
rights
which
are
traditionally
associated.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
it
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
an
individual
does
not
have,
we
use
the
term,
“vested
right”
to
the
benefits
which
he
is
be--
receiving,
but
however
we
characterize
that
interest,
it
is
a
substantial
one
and
it
is
an
interest
which
should
not
be
taken
from
an
individual
without
according
that
individual
basic
elements
of
procedural
fairness
and
due
process.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
don’t
believe
that
the
specific
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case
has
been
tested
with
respect
to
the
procedural
rights
that
are
to
be
afforded
individuals,
but
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
that
have
indicated
that
however
one
characterizes
the
interest,
that
government
must
act
in
a
fair
and
reasonable
way
in
the
administration
of
programs
where
basic
interests
are
involved,
whether
one
characterizes
it
as
a
right,
as
a
vested
right,
or
as
a
privilege.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
one--
to
answer
that
question
directly,
one
would
have
to
be
aware
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
pension
was
granted.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
under
those--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
the
government
does
not
have
to
grant
it
in
the
first
instance,
but
once
it
does
grant
it
and
assuming
that
the
legislation
remains
in
effect,
then
the
individual
should
be
entitled
to
continue
to
receive
that
pension
until
he
is
afford--
unless
there’s
a
determination
which
is
reached
after
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
matter,
the
individual
is
no
longer
eligible
for
that
pension.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
not
at
all.
i’m
not
suggesting
at
all
that
that
legislature
does
not
have
within
its
power
the
right
to
withdraw
the--
any
government
benefit
program.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
once
the
legislation
has
been
passed
and
once
benefits
are
being
provided
to
individuals,
before
specific
individual’s
welfare
assistance
is
removed,
he
should
be
afforded
those
opportunities
which
have
been
afforded
individuals
in
like
circumstances
by
this
court.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
my
position
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
have
a
hearing
which
ahs
the
basic
elements
of
due
process
before
termination--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
court,
in
the
case
of
green
versus
mcelroy
which,
admittedly,
was
not
a
constitutional
decision
but
spoken
constitutional
terms,
indicated
that
basic
procedural
protections
are
indeed
essential
before
the
right
to--
public
employment
is
withdrawn.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no.
in
cafeteria
workers
it
was
not
made
as
rigid,
but
the
court
clearly
indicated
that
due
process
applied
and,
with
the
analysis
i
suggested
earlier,
should
be
undertaken.
in
that
case,
it
was
felt
that
the
interest
of
the
government
and
national
security
and
the
fact
that
the
individual
involved
in
that
case
was
not
so
substantial
that
procedural
safeguards
of
the
type
we’re
seeking
here
should
be
afforded.
in
that
case,
the
individual
was
only
stopped
from
working
at
one
particular
base.
what
we
have
in
this
particular
situation
is
the
withdrawal
of
the
very
means
of
subsistence
to
an
individual.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
this
court
has
held
in
cases
where
there
has
not
been
the
overwriting
interest
of
national
security
that
a
public
employee
does
have
an
opportunity
to
be
afforded
an
opportunity
be
heard--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
before
his--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
before
his
benefits
are--
before
his
wages
are
taken.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
as
i
indicated,
in
the
case
of
green
versus
mcelroy--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
in
the
case
of
sloucher
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
the
individual
in
that
particular
case
was
afforded
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
his
wages
were
withdrawn.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
believe
so.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
would
say
that
the
welfare
recipient
is
entitled
to
such
a
hearing.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
regardless
of
what
the
employee
is
entitled
to--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
because,
again,
the
individual
was
on
public
assistance,
really
is
receiving
the
last
public
defense.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
at
all.
our
position
is
that
an
individual
can
be
found
initially
ineligible
by
the
welfare
department,
but
he
must
be
notified
of
that
fact
and,
if
he
contests
that
determination,
then
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
which
affords
him
basic
procedural
safeguards
when
such
a
vital
interest
is
involved.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
if
there
is
an
individual
dispute
regarding
eligibility,
then
the
individual
should
be
afforded
a
hearing.
the
problem
i
have
with
the
question
is
the
term
“trial
type.”
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
we’re
not
asking
for
a
hearing
which
has
all
the--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
right.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there
is
no
direct
holding
with
respect
to
a
welfare--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
there--
in
the
case
of
goldsby
versus
garfield,
which,
was
decided
in
1908--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
goldsby
versus
garfield.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
i
don’t
have
the
citation.
i
will
attempt
to
furnish
it
to
you.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
it
was
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
it’s
in
the
amicus
brief
in
the
companion
case.
the
citation
to
the
case
is
211
us
249.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
in
that
case,
it
was
a
question
of
the
government
providing
to
individuals
indian
lands,
and
mr.
goldsby
in
that
case
was
initially
found
eligible
for
an
allotment
of
this
land
provided
by
the
federal
government
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
action
of
the
secretary
in
removing
mr.
goldsby
from
the
roles
of
the
individuals
who
were
entitled
to
that
land
without
affording
mr.
goldsby
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
notice
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
well,
that
was
the
issue.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
did,
in
fact,
have
the
right--
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no,
the
court
did
not
find
that
he
did
or
did
not
legally
hold
that
land.
that
was
an
issue
to
be
left
for
the
administrative
determination.
the
court
was
only
dealing
with
whether
the
secretary
could
absent
any
type
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
goldsby
did,
in
fact,
have
proper
title
to
that
land,
whether
he
could
continue
on
the
land.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
yes,
i
think
i
will
conclude
at
this
particular
point.
i
would
just
like
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
large
mass
number
of
individuals
who
will
be
continuing
aid.
it
is
only
in
those
situations
where
there
are
serious
issues
of
fact
involved
that
we
are
asserting
that
there
is
a
right
to
continuation
of
assistance
and,
given
the
vital
interest
of
the
individuals
who
were
involved
here
and
given
the
fact
that
administrative
procedures
have
already
been
developed
by
the
state,
it
is
our
position
that
due
process
requires
the
procedural
protections
which
we
assert
are
required
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
e.
sitkin
no.
