justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sitkin,
you
said
that
a
person
becomes
eligible
after
a
full
investigation.
what
is
the
procedure?
that’s
not
a
trial
type
hearing,
is
it?
a
person
applies
for
old
age
assistance.
there’s
no
trial
type
hearing
before
he’s
found
to
be
eligible,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there’s
not
an
open
hearing
with
confrontation
and
cross-examination
and--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
what
the
issue
is.
i’m--
we’re
talking
about
the
process
by
which
somebody
eligible
becomes
ineligible.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
directed
to
the
how
did
he
become
eligible
in
the
first
place
and
that’s,
as
i
understand
it,
not
anything
like
a
trial
type
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
trial
type
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
the
real
issue
between
you
and
your
adversary,
i--
unless
i’m
mistaken,
is
when
this
hearing
need
be
given,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
hearing
of
the
kind
and
quality
that
you’re
talking
about
is
ultimately
given
under
the
law,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
ultimately
given.

justice
potter
stewart
what’s
that
about?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case,
in

to
a
nephew,
first,
claiming
that
it
was

story
to

that
it
was
carrying
out
her
son’s--
justice
