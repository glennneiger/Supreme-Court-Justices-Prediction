mr.

you
may

you’re
not
suggesting
that
the
legislature
would
have
to
consult
with
anyone
if
the

decided
to
repeal
the
entire

in

chief

it
didn’t
deal,
did
it,
with
the
question
of
when
the
pay
could
be
stopped
in
relation
to
the
time
of
the
hearing?
if
i
recall
correctly,
mcelroy
was
put
on
suspended
status
and
his
pay
was
stopped
and
such
hearing,
as
he
was
given,
was
given
at
a
later
date.
when
he
was
ultimately
reinstated,
he
got
backpay
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
suspension.
it
seems
to
me,
that’s
the
point
to
which
mr.
justice
white

addressing
himself.
i’m
not

you’ve
answered
