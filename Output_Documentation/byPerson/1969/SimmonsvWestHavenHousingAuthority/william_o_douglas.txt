justice
william
o.
douglas
i
can't
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
appellate
division
whatever
you
call
in
connecticut
adopted
that
at
on
us
relied
upon
that,
did
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
affirmed?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i've
read
this
opinion
three
times
now
and
i
--
maybe
i'm
just
stupid
but
i
don't
see
any
indication
that
the
court
rule
that
if
this
appeal
have
been
taken
without
any
suggestion
of
dilatory
tactics,
it
would
been
decided
differently.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
just
talking
about
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
sometime
could
you
supply
a
supplemental
memorandum
and
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
underline
of
the
--
marking
the
lines
in
the
paragraphs
in
this
opinion
that
possibly
indicate
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
doesn't
appear
to
any
of
the
statutes
have
decided
but
there
maybe
other
statutes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
maybe
you
could
add
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
thought
this
was
an
equal
protection
court
not
whether
the
things
you
can
state
or
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
does
the
bond
should
have
to
be
furnished?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
i
mean
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
that
and
their
some
members
of
the
court
appeal
the
same
way
perhaps.
but
i'm
just
trying
in
the
setting
the
statute,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
bond
will
be
required
if
it's
dilatory
or
not
be
required
if
it's
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
no,
it
just
says
it
shall
be
stayed
unless
it
appears?
which
is
a
hardly
relevant
to
the
constitution
of
process
have
presented
here,
is
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
the
unless
is
modifies
the
state
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
the
surety
bond?
unless
i
have
a
different
set
of
the
statutes
than
you
have.
