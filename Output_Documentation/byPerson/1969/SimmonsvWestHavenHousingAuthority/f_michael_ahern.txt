mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
connecticut
is
not
a
party,
a
named
party
to
this
appeal.
however,
because
of
the
decision
of
the
west
haven
housing
authority
which
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
not
to
further
relief
or
orally
argued
the
issue
raised
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
the
state
of
connecticut
filed
the
motion
with
this
court
for
permission
to
orally
argue
the
issue
and
the
court
graciously
granted
it.
that's
why
i'm
here
this
morning.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
state
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
public
housing
authority
is
established
by
both
state
and
federal
statute.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
and
also
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
property
owners
who
have
been,
shall
i
say
denigrated
by
the
tenants
by
nonpayment
of
rent,
so
that
they
have
their
rights
to
their
own
property
and
to
the
retention
of
their
property.
because
of
the
adverse
and
disruptive
effect
on
civil
process
if
this
appeal
is
sustained.
the
state
of
connecticut
and
14
of
her
sister
states
have
together
entered
into
a
amici
curiae
brief
in
this
case
in
support
of
the
appellee's
position.
this
is
pursuant
to
rule
42,
subsection
4
of
the
rules
to
this
court.
if
i
may,
in
reviewing
the
file
in
this
case
one
cannot
help
but
the
amaze
that
the
zealous
and
ambiguous
advocacy
of
the
appellant's
rights
by
counsel
in
the
lower
courts.
in
the
period
between
the
initial
notice
to
quick
possession
on
july
12,
1967
until
the
trial
on
the
merits
was
held
on
january
9,
1968.
six
judges
of
the
connecticut
circuit
court
were
called
upon
to
rule
on
the
same
number
of
motions,
six
motions.
the
legal
maneuvering
of
counsel
for
appellants
has
followed
a
torturous
and
very
exhausted
path
through
both
the
state
and
federal
judicial
systems.
appellants
have
their
day
in
court
and
the
connecticut
circuit
court
and
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
and
then
the
state
supreme
court.
simultaneously,
a
inaugurated
hearings
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
and
finally
to
this
honorable
court
this
morning.
i
count
36
separate
entries
in
the
file
concerning
legal
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
analyze
them
for
you
and
highlight
certain
operations
and
approaches
by
the
appellants.
they
became
tenants
of
the
housing
authority
on
november
1,
1966
under
a
written
a
lease.
a
monthly
written
lease
which
was
renewable
each
month
at
the
rate
of
$72.00
per
month.
the
monthly
rent
was
determined
by
an
objective
schedule
according
to
their
ability
to
pay.
having
withheld
payment
of
the
rent
for
the
months
of
may,
june,
and
july
of
1967.
the
appellants
were
given
a
statutory
notice
to
quit
the
premises
on
july
12,
1967.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
other
case
has
never
been
dismissed
or
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
in
view
of
the
fact
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
situation
of
the
initial
summary
process
or
the
previous
summary
process
action
was
brought
for
reasons
other
than
the
statutory
reasons
for
summary
process.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it
wasn't
carry
through
because
the
attorneys
for
the
housing
authority
recognized
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
a
proper
motion
and
they
then
had
other
reasons
for
bring
the
summary
process
action
which
is
the
nonpayment
of
rent.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no
it
would
--
they
claim
it
was
brought
about
by
the
first
action.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
may
it
please
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
you
please
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
claim
of
the
appellant
that
the
second
summary
process
action
was
brought
because
of
the
first
one.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
have
claimed
that,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
is.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
since,
i
am
not
the
attorney
for
the
west
haven
housing
authority,
i
can't
answer
that
question,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i'm
defending
them
as
an
amicus
of
filing
a
brief
from
behalf
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
you
are
right
that
the
action
was
never
withdrawn,
the
first
action.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
appellant
is
not
having
complied
with
the
notice
to
quit.
we're
given
a
statutory
--
were
asked
again
to
quit
and
when
they
refuse
a
summary
process
action
was
instituted
in
the
circuit
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut.
that
was
on
july
19,
1967,
which
was
actually
five
--
three
months
after
the
first
withholding
of
the
rent.
after
the
preliminary
motions
were
disposed
of
trial
on
the
merits
was
had
on
january
9,
1968,
which
resulted
in
judgment
for
possession
for
the
housing
authority.
pursuant
to
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
the
appellants
instituted
an
appeal
which
was
promptly
filed
with
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
of
connecticut.
in
lieu
of
the
surety
bond
required
by
the
statute,
they
attached
to
their
appeal
a
motion
to
waive
surety
bond
on
the
grounds
of
alleged
indigency.
after
a
full
hearing
in
the
court,
the
same
trial
judge
who
had
heard
the
case
on
the
merits
earlier
denied
the
motion
because
he
found
that
the
appeal
was
not
taken
in
good
faith
but
for
purposes
of
delay
and
obstruction.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
dehenzel,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
is
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
a
hearing
on
the
merits
on
january
9,
1968,
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
hearing
is
not
made
a
part
of
the
transcript
to
his
decision
i
believe
is.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
did
--
it
is
mentioned
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
that
the
lower
court
found
that
the
action
is
taken
for
reasons
of
delay.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
our
position
your
honor
that
that's
the
reason
they
did
affirm.
the
appellants
filed
a
motion
for
review
with
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
from
the
judge
dissenters
denial
of
the
motion.
and
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
appellate
division
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
thereafter,
the
appellants
filed
the
petition
for
certification
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
petition
was
dismissed
or
denied.
the
housing
authority
then
moved
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
to
terminate
the
stay
of
execution
which
motion
was
granted.
now
concurrently
with
the
state
legal
activities,
the
appellants
in
order
to
delay
their
eviction
filed
an
injunction
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut.
that
court
in
a
very
lengthy
decision
dismissed
the
federal
complaint
and
the
decision
was
promptly
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
federal
complaint
as
moot
on
january
10,
1968
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court,
which
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
september
7
--
on
april
7,
1969.
i
think
it
would
--
it
should
emphasize
to
this
point
that
the
housing
authority
finally
obtain
possession
of
the
premises
on
july
26,
1968,
which
was
full
year
after
the
filing
of
the
summary
process
action
in
the
circuit
court
in
connecticut
and
more
than
15
months
after
the
tenants
decided
to
withhold
the
payment
of
rent
to
the
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it's
still
in
the
custody
of
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
housing
authority
has
never
filed
a
motion
to
reach
it
and
the
clerk
is
holding
it
pending
the
ultimate
determination
of
this
case.
in
addition
to
the
zoas
legal
representation
provided
the
appellants
by
counsel
in
the
lower
courts.
they
have
the
benefit
of
extensive
briefs
by
their
attorneys
and
also
by
several
organizations
who
have
filed
amici
curiae
briefs
in
this
court.
the
question
presented
by
the
appellant's
appeal
is
whether
the
surety
bond
requirement
of
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes
on
an
appeal
on
summary
process
action
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
connecticut
summary
process
statute
was
initially
adopted
in
1806,
prior
to
that
time
if
a
land
owner
desire
to
oust
the
tenant
of
possession.
he
was
required
to
file
an
action
in
ejectment
in
the
courts
which
was
a
slow
and
expensive
procedure.
the
purpose
of
the
summary
process
statute
was
to
give
the
property
owner
and
all
to
that
means
of
recovering
possession
of
his
property
from
a
tenant
who
was
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
pay
his
rent.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
connecticut
summary
process
statute
is
not
a
statute
of
general
application.
its
applicability
is
limited
to
those
cases
where
there
is
a
lease
which
has
terminated
either
by
time
or
nonpayment
of
rent
or
where
there
is
occupation
without
greater
privilege.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
the
property
owner
utilizing
the
summary
process
procedure
does
not
recover
rent.
he
only
recovers
possession
of
his
property.
in
order
the
reach
the
unpaid
rent,
he
must
bring
a
separate
subsequent
legal
action
for
money
his
own.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
all
i
can
suggest
justice
douglas
is
that
we
read
it
differently.
i
think
we
agree
with
justice
harlan
in
his
decision
on
their
motion
to
suspend
execution
that
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
realize
you
are
and
i
--
we
read
it
differently
that's
all
i
can
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
will
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
will
do
that
justice
douglas.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
page
20?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
black?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
can
find
it
justice
black
but
i
can't
find
where
the
quote
is
taken
from.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
find
that
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
this
appears
--
this
is
the
colloquy
between
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
court.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
actually,
this
quotation
is
taken
from
the
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
statutes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
if
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
unless,
it
appears
to
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
that
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
no
appeal
shall
be
taken,
if
i
may
read
the
whole
sentence,
maybe
in
the
context
here
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no
appeal
and
this
is
from
the
statute.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
and
i
quote
it.
“no
appeal
shall
be
taken
except
within
said
period
and
if
an
appeal
is
taken
within
set
period,
execution
shall
be
stayed
until
the
final
determination
of
the
cause.
unless,
it
appears
to
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay.”
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
am.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
why
doesn't
or
why
doesn't
it?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
do
not
feel
that
there's
a
substantial
federal
question
involved.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
just
makes
provision
for
a
surety
bond
in
all
cases.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
just
states
that
a
surety
bond
shall
be
required.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
unless
it
appears
who
tried
the
case
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
purpose
of
delay.
in
other
words,
i
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
you've
raised
the
point
that
haven't
occured
to
me
that's
the
trouble
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
he
could
in
our
opinion.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
this
is
where
the
appellants
in
the
housing
authority
disagreed
whether
or
not
the
surety
bond
in
all
cases
must
accompany
in
appeal.
certainly,
since
this
for
sole
protection
of
the
landlord,
the
landlord
could
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
we
feel
and
similar
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
the
connecticut
case
that
provides
that
justice
white.
however,
we
have
cited
cases
and
we
feel
once
the
matter
is
before
the
court.
that
the
court
could
waive
the
surety
bond
as
long
as
it
provide
adequate
protection
for
the
landlord.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
seems
to
be
language
in
that
decision
as
i
recall
it,
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
marshall,
i
couldn't
say
whether
they
would
be
appeal
to
this
court.
the
way
things
are
going
today,
i
think
everything
is
appealed
up
here.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
that's
probably
because
of
the
word
“shown
in
the
statute”
and
they're
referring
to
the
same
that
this
is
the
statute
under
which
they
have
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
they
claim
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
bond
on
appeal
and
stay
of
execution.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
it
means
to
show
unless
the
court
appeals
that
there
are
equitable
considerations
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court.
either
the
court
could
use
its
good
offices
to
have
the
landlord
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
which
i
think
can
be
done
--
could
be
done
because
the
sole
purpose
of
the
surety
bond
is
to
protect
the
landlord's
interest.
then
i
think
also,
that
if
the
court
felt
that
the
circumstances
in
the
particular
case
warranted.
it
could
probably,
it
could
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
as
long
as
some
means
were
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
land
owners.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
the
crux
of
this
case
this
morning,
i
believe
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
have
cases
in
other
jurisdiction
which
was
cited
which
give
the
seem
to
give
courts
that
authority
and
we
feel
they
apply
to
this
situation
also
but
we
do
not
of
any
connecticut
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it's
breaking
new
ground
justice
stewart,
i
believe.
the
west
haven
housing
authority
as
i
stated
earlier
is
a
federal
and
state
instrumentality.
it
set
up
by
state
and
federal
statutes,
it's
finance
by
public
bond
issues
and
by
grants
from
the
united
states
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
which
controls
its
operations.
the
income
derived
from
the
tenant
rentals
is
used
to
meet
its
obligations
to
bond
holders
and
to
pay
the
normal
continuing
operating
expenses
of
the
authority.
in
the
defending
the
summary
process
action
in
the
trial
court,
the
appellants
advanced
seven
special
defenses
all
of
which
were
procedural
and
all
of
which
were
considered
by
the
trial
court
and
evidently
considered
meritless.
it
is
obvious
from
a
reading
of
the
first
special
defense
and
the
trial
brief
that
the
reason,
the
appellants,
the
tenants
determined
to
withhold
payment
of
rent
from
the
authority
was
that
they
were
lift
because
of
the
previous
summary
process
action
instituted
by
the
authority
which
was
not
prosecuted
to
effect.
the
trial
court
in
entering
judgment
for
possession
of
the
premises
expressly
found
that
the
appellants
had
not
paid
rent
for
a
period
of
eight
months
from
april
1967
to
december
of
1967,
which
was
immediately
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
merits.
and
the
trial
court
made
the
following
significant
statement
in
its
memorandum
of
decision,
dated
january
16,
1968,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it.
”the
record
in
this
quick
case
clearly
shows
what
can
happen
to
a
summary
proceeding
where
the
process
is
abused
by
dilatory
tactics,
defense
is
interposed
to
delay
or
obstruct
the
proceeding
and
every
effort
made
to
delay
a
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits."
that
can
be
found
in
the
record
appendix
at
page
5.
just
three
days
after
the
above
decision
was
rendered
by
the
trial
court,
that
is
on
january
19,
1968,
the
same
trial
judge
heard
arguments
addressed
to
the
appellant's
motion
to
waive
surety
bond.
after
argument,
the
trial
judge
found
“this
appeal
is
being
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
and
the
motion
was
denied.”
but,
posting
requirements
upon
the
privilege
of
obtaining
judicial
relief
are
found
in
both
the
state
and
federal
statutes.
and
this
courts
has
consistently
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
proscribing
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
precedent
to
the
seeking
of
judicial
relief
in
its
courts
so
long
as
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real
and
the
conditions
imposed
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
a
legitimate
object.
applying
this
standard
to
the
surety
bond
provision
of
section
52-542
we
submit.
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
proscribes
the
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
with
a
legitimate
object
in
view.
that
is
the
protection
of
the
landowner.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
in
this
case,
yes.
in
this
context
of
this
case
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
we
take
the
position
on
appeal
bond
is
required.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
surety
bond
is
essential
to
the
appeal.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
language
of
the
statute
at
this
point.
then
the
question
comes
in
whether
since
both
law
and
equity
refuse
in
our
court
system
whether
the
court
can
utilizing
equitable
considerations
itself
waive
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
feel
that
it
could.
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
in
the
context
of
the
proper
case
where
the
situation
is
such
that
the
tenant
for
valid
reason
has
not
paid
the
rent
and
cannot
pay
the
rent,
we
think
that
it
would.
this
case
we
submit
is
not
a
case
where
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
pardon
me?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
he
could
continue
to
pay
the
rent
as
they
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
although,
we
haven't
found
any
connecticut
citations.
we
have
cited
case
in
other
jurisdiction
which
were
seem
to
hold
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it's
in
the
tip
of
the
statute
as
far
as
its
language
is
concerned,
yes
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
evidently
is
the
position
of
judge
dehenzel
of
the
trial
court
and
we
agree
with
it.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
think
it
had
to
chief
justice
because
of
the
fact
that
it
went
along
with
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
the
action
was
instituted
for
purposes
of
delay.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
will
attempt
to
analyze
it
to
that
effect
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
judge
jacobs.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
justice
brennan.
certainly,
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct
justice
brennan.
certainly,
the
plight
of
the
indigent
tenants
who
are
unable
to
pay
their
bills,
elicit
the
sympathy
and
compassion
of
all
peoples.
however,
we
submit
that
some
sympathy
and
compassion
should
be
reserved
for
the
real
property
owner
who
must
meet
his
mortgage
obligations
and
other
financial
obligations
or
risk,
the
loss
of
his
property.
all
landlords
are
not
wealthy
and
all
tenants
are
not
indigent.
and
most
property
owners
cannot
afford
the
luxury
of
tenant
who
was
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
pay
his
rent.m
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
if
the
record
shows
it
but
certainly,
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
aren't
sufficient
housing
accommodations
for
the
poor
and
that
there
would
be
a
list
of
people
waiting.
and
further,
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
housing
authority
depends
on
a
tenant's
payment
of
monthly
rents
in
order
to
meet
its
obligation
to
bond
holders
and
its
obligations
to
and
its
financial
obligations
in
the
continuing
operation
of
the
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
i
may
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
the
offer
to
make
payment
into
court
was
made
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
held
on
the
motion
to
waive
surety
bond
which
was
nine
months
after
they
stopped
paying
rent.
the
offer
was
to
pay
current
rents
into
the
court
not
be
back
nine
months
which
they
had
not
paid.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
not
in
summary
process
action.
a
separate
action
would
have
been
brought
by
the
landlord.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
why
would
he
have
to?
i
believe
the
reason
the
court
would
not
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
attorneys
for
the
appellants
was
the
fact
and
i
think
the
court
asked
the
direct
question
of
one
of
the
attorneys
whether
they
would
make
payment
of
the
nine
months
in
arrears
and
they
said
they
would
not.
they
would
only
take
care
of
the
future
in
rental
payments.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i
think
these
all
comes
in
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
dilatory
tactics
used
because
normally
for
summary
process
action
takes
considerably
less
than
seven
months
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
not
in
connecticut
that
they
have
a
hearing
in
connecticut,
the
full
hearing
on
the
merits,
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
have
nothing
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
certainly
on
page
67,
the
paragraph
which
starts
on
that
page.
they
mentioned
that
they
briefly
review
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
and
i
would
assume
that
the
review
of
those
proceedings,
eventhough
they
don't
might
not
mentioned
it
here,
would
take
into
consideration
of
the
activities
in
the
court
below
and
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge.
certainly,
the
appellate
division
had
the
trial
judgment
or
memorandum
of
decision
before
at
the
time
that
reviewed
the
case.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct.
on
page
67
and
thereafter
actually.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
would
trust
that
the
statement
of
the
trial
judge
would
be
given
as
widest
application
in
that
connection,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
connecticut
is
not
a
party,
a
named
party
to
this
appeal.
however,
because
of
the
decision
of
the
west
haven
housing
authority
which
is
the
appellee
in
this
case
not
to
further
relief
or
orally
argued
the
issue
raised
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
the
state
of
connecticut
filed
the
motion
with
this
court
for
permission
to
orally
argue
the
issue
and
the
court
graciously
granted
it.
that's
why
i'm
here
this
morning.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
state
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
public
housing
authority
is
established
by
both
state
and
federal
statute.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
and
also
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
property
owners
who
have
been,
shall
i
say
denigrated
by
the
tenants
by
nonpayment
of
rent,
so
that
they
have
their
rights
to
their
own
property
and
to
the
retention
of
their
property.
because
of
the
adverse
and
disruptive
effect
on
civil
process
if
this
appeal
is
sustained.
the
state
of
connecticut
and
14
of
her
sister
states
have
together
entered
into
a
amici
curiae
brief
in
this
case
in
support
of
the
appellee's
position.
this
is
pursuant
to
rule
42,
subsection
4
of
the
rules
to
this
court.
if
i
may,
in
reviewing
the
file
in
this
case
one
cannot
help
but
the
amaze
that
the
zealous
and
ambiguous
advocacy
of
the
appellant's
rights
by
counsel
in
the
lower
courts.
in
the
period
between
the
initial
notice
to
quick
possession
on
july
12,
1967
until
the
trial
on
the
merits
was
held
on
january
9,
1968.
six
judges
of
the
connecticut
circuit
court
were
called
upon
to
rule
on
the
same
number
of
motions,
six
motions.
the
legal
maneuvering
of
counsel
for
appellants
has
followed
a
torturous
and
very
exhausted
path
through
both
the
state
and
federal
judicial
systems.
appellants
have
their
day
in
court
and
the
connecticut
circuit
court
and
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
and
then
the
state
supreme
court.
simultaneously,
a
inaugurated
hearings
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
and
finally
to
this
honorable
court
this
morning.
i
count
36
separate
entries
in
the
file
concerning
legal
action
on
the
part
of
the
appellants.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
analyze
them
for
you
and
highlight
certain
operations
and
approaches
by
the
appellants.
they
became
tenants
of
the
housing
authority
on
november
1,
1966
under
a
written
a
lease.
a
monthly
written
lease
which
was
renewable
each
month
at
the
rate
of
$72.00
per
month.
the
monthly
rent
was
determined
by
an
objective
schedule
according
to
their
ability
to
pay.
having
withheld
payment
of
the
rent
for
the
months
of
may,
june,
and
july
of
1967.
the
appellants
were
given
a
statutory
notice
to
quit
the
premises
on
july
12,
1967.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
other
case
has
never
been
dismissed
or
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
in
view
of
the
fact
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
situation
of
the
initial
summary
process
or
the
previous
summary
process
action
was
brought
for
reasons
other
than
the
statutory
reasons
for
summary
process.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it
wasn't
carry
through
because
the
attorneys
for
the
housing
authority
recognized
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
a
proper
motion
and
they
then
had
other
reasons
for
bring
the
summary
process
action
which
is
the
nonpayment
of
rent.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no
it
would
--
they
claim
it
was
brought
about
by
the
first
action.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
may
it
please
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
you
please
justice
marshall,
this
is
the
claim
of
the
appellant
that
the
second
summary
process
action
was
brought
because
of
the
first
one.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
have
claimed
that,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
is.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
since,
i
am
not
the
attorney
for
the
west
haven
housing
authority,
i
can't
answer
that
question,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i'm
defending
them
as
an
amicus
of
filing
a
brief
from
behalf
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
you
are
right
that
the
action
was
never
withdrawn,
the
first
action.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
appellant
is
not
having
complied
with
the
notice
to
quit.
we're
given
a
statutory
--
were
asked
again
to
quit
and
when
they
refuse
a
summary
process
action
was
instituted
in
the
circuit
court
for
the
state
of
connecticut.
that
was
on
july
19,
1967,
which
was
actually
five
--
three
months
after
the
first
withholding
of
the
rent.
after
the
preliminary
motions
were
disposed
of
trial
on
the
merits
was
had
on
january
9,
1968,
which
resulted
in
judgment
for
possession
for
the
housing
authority.
pursuant
to
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
the
appellants
instituted
an
appeal
which
was
promptly
filed
with
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
of
connecticut.
in
lieu
of
the
surety
bond
required
by
the
statute,
they
attached
to
their
appeal
a
motion
to
waive
surety
bond
on
the
grounds
of
alleged
indigency.
after
a
full
hearing
in
the
court,
the
same
trial
judge
who
had
heard
the
case
on
the
merits
earlier
denied
the
motion
because
he
found
that
the
appeal
was
not
taken
in
good
faith
but
for
purposes
of
delay
and
obstruction.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
dehenzel,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
is
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
a
hearing
on
the
merits
on
january
9,
1968,
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
hearing
is
not
made
a
part
of
the
transcript
to
his
decision
i
believe
is.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
they
did
--
it
is
mentioned
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
that
the
lower
court
found
that
the
action
is
taken
for
reasons
of
delay.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
our
position
your
honor
that
that's
the
reason
they
did
affirm.
the
appellants
filed
a
motion
for
review
with
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
from
the
judge
dissenters
denial
of
the
motion.
and
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
appellate
division
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
thereafter,
the
appellants
filed
the
petition
for
certification
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
and
petition
was
dismissed
or
denied.
the
housing
authority
then
moved
the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
to
terminate
the
stay
of
execution
which
motion
was
granted.
now
concurrently
with
the
state
legal
activities,
the
appellants
in
order
to
delay
their
eviction
filed
an
injunction
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut.
that
court
in
a
very
lengthy
decision
dismissed
the
federal
complaint
and
the
decision
was
promptly
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
federal
complaint
as
moot
on
january
10,
1968
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court,
which
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
september
7
--
on
april
7,
1969.
i
think
it
would
--
it
should
emphasize
to
this
point
that
the
housing
authority
finally
obtain
possession
of
the
premises
on
july
26,
1968,
which
was
full
year
after
the
filing
of
the
summary
process
action
in
the
circuit
court
in
connecticut
and
more
than
15
months
after
the
tenants
decided
to
withhold
the
payment
of
rent
to
the
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
believe
it's
still
in
the
custody
of
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
housing
authority
has
never
filed
a
motion
to
reach
it
and
the
clerk
is
holding
it
pending
the
ultimate
determination
of
this
case.
in
addition
to
the
zoas
legal
representation
provided
the
appellants
by
counsel
in
the
lower
courts.
they
have
the
benefit
of
extensive
briefs
by
their
attorneys
and
also
by
several
organizations
who
have
filed
amici
curiae
briefs
in
this
court.
the
question
presented
by
the
appellant's
appeal
is
whether
the
surety
bond
requirement
of
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes
on
an
appeal
on
summary
process
action
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
connecticut
summary
process
statute
was
initially
adopted
in
1806,
prior
to
that
time
if
a
land
owner
desire
to
oust
the
tenant
of
possession.
he
was
required
to
file
an
action
in
ejectment
in
the
courts
which
was
a
slow
and
expensive
procedure.
the
purpose
of
the
summary
process
statute
was
to
give
the
property
owner
and
all
to
that
means
of
recovering
possession
of
his
property
from
a
tenant
who
was
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
pay
his
rent.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
connecticut
summary
process
statute
is
not
a
statute
of
general
application.
its
applicability
is
limited
to
those
cases
where
there
is
a
lease
which
has
terminated
either
by
time
or
nonpayment
of
rent
or
where
there
is
occupation
without
greater
privilege.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
the
property
owner
utilizing
the
summary
process
procedure
does
not
recover
rent.
he
only
recovers
possession
of
his
property.
in
order
the
reach
the
unpaid
rent,
he
must
bring
a
separate
subsequent
legal
action
for
money
his
own.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
all
i
can
suggest
justice
douglas
is
that
we
read
it
differently.
i
think
we
agree
with
justice
harlan
in
his
decision
on
their
motion
to
suspend
execution
that
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
realize
you
are
and
i
--
we
read
it
differently
that's
all
i
can
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
will
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
will
do
that
justice
douglas.
mr.
f.

ahern

mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
black?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
can
find
it
justice
black
but
i
can't
find
where
the
quote
is
taken
from.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
find
that
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
this
appears
--
this
is
the
colloquy
between
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
court.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
actually,
this
quotation
is
taken
from
the
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
statutes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
if
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
unless,
it
appears
to
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
that
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
no
appeal
shall
be
taken,
if
i
may
read
the
whole
sentence,
maybe
in
the
context
here
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no
appeal
and
this
is
from
the
statute.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
and
i
quote
it.
“no
appeal
shall
be
taken
except
within
said
period
and
if
an
appeal
is
taken
within
set
period,
execution
shall
be
stayed
until
the
final
determination
of
the
cause.
unless,
it
appears
to
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay.”
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
i
am.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
why
doesn't
or
why
doesn't
it?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
do
not
feel
that
there's
a
substantial
federal
question
involved.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
just
makes
provision
for
a
surety
bond
in
all
cases.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it
just
states
that
a
surety
bond
shall
be
required.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
unless
it
appears
who
tried
the
case
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
purpose
of
delay.
in
other
words,
i
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
you've
raised
the
point
that
haven't
occured
to
me
that's
the
trouble
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
he
could
in
our
opinion.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
this
is
where
the
appellants
in
the
housing
authority
disagreed
whether
or
not
the
surety
bond
in
all
cases
must
accompany
in
appeal.
certainly,
since
this
for
sole
protection
of
the
landlord,
the
landlord
could
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
we
feel
and
similar
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
the
connecticut
case
that
provides
that
justice
white.
however,
we
have
cited
cases
and
we
feel
once
the
matter
is
before
the
court.
that
the
court
could
waive
the
surety
bond
as
long
as
it
provide
adequate
protection
for
the
landlord.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
there
seems
to
be
language
in
that
decision
as
i
recall
it,
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
justice
marshall,
i
couldn't
say
whether
they
would
be
appeal
to
this
court.
the
way
things
are
going
today,
i
think
everything
is
appealed
up
here.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
that's
probably
because
of
the
word
“shown
in
the
statute”
and
they're
referring
to
the
same
that
this
is
the
statute
under
which
they
have
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
they
claim
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
bond
on
appeal
and
stay
of
execution.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
think
it
means
to
show
unless
the
court
appeals
that
there
are
equitable
considerations
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court.
either
the
court
could
use
its
good
offices
to
have
the
landlord
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
which
i
think
can
be
done
--
could
be
done
because
the
sole
purpose
of
the
surety
bond
is
to
protect
the
landlord's
interest.
then
i
think
also,
that
if
the
court
felt
that
the
circumstances
in
the
particular
case
warranted.
it
could
probably,
it
could
waive
the
surety
bond
requirement
as
long
as
some
means
were
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
land
owners.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
the
crux
of
this
case
this
morning,
i
believe
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
have
cases
in
other
jurisdiction
which
was
cited
which
give
the
seem
to
give
courts
that
authority
and
we
feel
they
apply
to
this
situation
also
but
we
do
not
of
any
connecticut
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it's
breaking
new
ground
justice
stewart,
i
believe.
the
west
haven
housing
authority
as
i
stated
earlier
is
a
federal
and
state
instrumentality.
it
set
up
by
state
and
federal
statutes,
it's
finance
by
public
bond
issues
and
by
grants
from
the
united
states
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
which
controls
its
operations.
the
income
derived
from
the
tenant
rentals
is
used
to
meet
its
obligations
to
bond
holders
and
to
pay
the
normal
continuing
operating
expenses
of
the
authority.
in
the
defending
the
summary
process
action
in
the
trial
court,
the
appellants
advanced
seven
special
defenses
all
of
which
were
procedural
and
all
of
which
were
considered
by
the
trial
court
and
evidently
considered
meritless.
it
is
obvious
from
a
reading
of
the
first
special
defense
and
the
trial
brief
that
the
reason,
the
appellants,
the
tenants
determined
to
withhold
payment
of
rent
from
the
authority
was
that
they
were
lift
because
of
the
previous
summary
process
action
instituted
by
the
authority
which
was
not
prosecuted
to
effect.
the
trial
court
in
entering
judgment
for
possession
of
the
premises
expressly
found
that
the
appellants
had
not
paid
rent
for
a
period
of
eight
months
from
april
1967
to
december
of
1967,
which
was
immediately
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
merits.
and
the
trial
court
made
the
following
significant
statement
in
its
memorandum
of
decision,
dated
january
16,
1968,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it.
”the
record
in
this
quick
case
clearly
shows
what
can
happen
to
a
summary
proceeding
where
the
process
is
abused
by
dilatory
tactics,
defense
is
interposed
to
delay
or
obstruct
the
proceeding
and
every
effort
made
to
delay
a
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits."
that
can
be
found
in
the
record
appendix
at
page
5.
just
three
days
after
the
above
decision
was
rendered
by
the
trial
court,
that
is
on
january
19,
1968,
the
same
trial
judge
heard
arguments
addressed
to
the
appellant's
motion
to
waive
surety
bond.
after
argument,
the
trial
judge
found
“this
appeal
is
being
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
and
the
motion
was
denied.”
but,
posting
requirements
upon
the
privilege
of
obtaining
judicial
relief
are
found
in
both
the
state
and
federal
statutes.
and
this
courts
has
consistently
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
proscribing
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
precedent
to
the
seeking
of
judicial
relief
in
its
courts
so
long
as
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real
and
the
conditions
imposed
have
a
reasonable
relationship
to
a
legitimate
object.
applying
this
standard
to
the
surety
bond
provision
of
section
52-542
we
submit.
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
proscribes
the
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
with
a
legitimate
object
in
view.
that
is
the
protection
of
the
landowner.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
in
this
case,
yes.
in
this
context
of
this
case
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
we
take
the
position
on
appeal
bond
is
required.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
the
surety
bond
is
essential
to
the
appeal.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
language
of
the
statute
at
this
point.
then
the
question
comes
in
whether
since
both
law
and
equity
refuse
in
our
court
system
whether
the
court
can
utilizing
equitable
considerations
itself
waive
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
feel
that
it
could.
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
in
the
context
of
the
proper
case
where
the
situation
is
such
that
the
tenant
for
valid
reason
has
not
paid
the
rent
and
cannot
pay
the
rent,
we
think
that
it
would.
this
case
we
submit
is
not
a
case
where
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
pardon
me?
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
but
he
could
continue
to
pay
the
rent
as
they
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
although,
we
haven't
found
any
connecticut
citations.
we
have
cited
case
in
other
jurisdiction
which
were
seem
to
hold
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
it's
in
the
tip
of
the
statute
as
far
as
its
language
is
concerned,
yes
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
evidently
is
the
position
of
judge
dehenzel
of
the
trial
court
and
we
agree
with
it.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
think
it
had
to
chief
justice
because
of
the
fact
that
it
went
along
with
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
the
action
was
instituted
for
purposes
of
delay.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
we
will
attempt
to
analyze
it
to
that
effect
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
judge
jacobs.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
justice
brennan.
certainly,
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct
justice
brennan.
certainly,
the
plight
of
the
indigent
tenants
who
are
unable
to
pay
their
bills,
elicit
the
sympathy
and
compassion
of
all
peoples.
however,
we
submit
that
some
sympathy
and
compassion
should
be
reserved
for
the
real
property
owner
who
must
meet
his
mortgage
obligations
and
other
financial
obligations
or
risk,
the
loss
of
his
property.
all
landlords
are
not
wealthy
and
all
tenants
are
not
indigent.
and
most
property
owners
cannot
afford
the
luxury
of
tenant
who
was
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
pay
his
rent.m
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
if
the
record
shows
it
but
certainly,
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
aren't
sufficient
housing
accommodations
for
the
poor
and
that
there
would
be
a
list
of
people
waiting.
and
further,
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
housing
authority
depends
on
a
tenant's
payment
of
monthly
rents
in
order
to
meet
its
obligation
to
bond
holders
and
its
obligations
to
and
its
financial
obligations
in
the
continuing
operation
of
the
authority.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
if
i
may
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
the
offer
to
make
payment
into
court
was
made
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
held
on
the
motion
to
waive
surety
bond
which
was
nine
months
after
they
stopped
paying
rent.
the
offer
was
to
pay
current
rents
into
the
court
not
be
back
nine
months
which
they
had
not
paid.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
not
in
summary
process
action.
a
separate
action
would
have
been
brought
by
the
landlord.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
correct.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
why
would
he
have
to?
i
believe
the
reason
the
court
would
not
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
attorneys
for
the
appellants
was
the
fact
and
i
think
the
court
asked
the
direct
question
of
one
of
the
attorneys
whether
they
would
make
payment
of
the
nine
months
in
arrears
and
they
said
they
would
not.
they
would
only
take
care
of
the
future
in
rental
payments.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
i
think
these
all
comes
in
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
dilatory
tactics
used
because
normally
for
summary
process
action
takes
considerably
less
than
seven
months
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
not
in
connecticut
that
they
have
a
hearing
in
connecticut,
the
full
hearing
on
the
merits,
justice
marshall.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
have
nothing
--
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
well,
certainly
on
page
67,
the
paragraph
which
starts
on
that
page.
they
mentioned
that
they
briefly
review
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
and
i
would
assume
that
the
review
of
those
proceedings,
eventhough
they
don't
might
not
mentioned
it
here,
would
take
into
consideration
of
the
activities
in
the
court
below
and
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge.
certainly,
the
appellate
division
had
the
trial
judgment
or
memorandum
of
decision
before
at
the
time
that
reviewed
the
case.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that
is
correct.
on
page
67
and
thereafter
actually.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
would
trust
that
the
statement
of
the
trial
judge
would
be
given
as
widest
application
in
that
connection,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
thank
you
very
much.
