--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
francis
x.
dineen.
i
represent
the
appellants
in
this
matter.
jurisdiction
of
this
court
has
invoked
under
28
united
states
code,
section
1257,
subsection
2
because
of
the
fact
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
as
an
issue.
and
by
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
constitutionality
of
that
state
statute
has
been
upheld.
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
denied
our
petition
for
certification
and
so
the
appeal
to
this
court
is
from
the
appellant's
division
of
the
circuit
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
involve
a
relatively
ordinary
eviction
action
which
was
commenced
in
july
of
1967.
thereafter,
pleadings
were
filed
and
defenses
were
raised
and
in
fact
seven
special
defenses
were
raised
to
the
eviction
action
that
was
brought.
in
january
of
1968,
a
trial
took
place.
on
january
16,
judgment
was
entered
for
the
landlord,
the
housing
authority
of
west
haven.
thereafter
on
january
18,
our
appeal
from
that
judgment
was
filed
with
the
appellate
division.
at
that
time,
pursuant
to
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
it
was
required
that
we
file
with
the
court
a
bond
with
a
surety
to
cover
the
rents
that
might
accrue
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
and
in
order
to
file
that
bond,
on
behalf
of
our
clients,
we
went
to
several
surety
companies
asking
them
what
they
would
require
to
go
on
the
bond
as
a
surety.
the
bond
in
this
case
because
the
rent
was
$72.00
per
month
would
have
been
approximately
something
in
the
nature
of
$400.00
to
$500.00
or
even
more
dollars
for
this
bond.
in
fact,
that
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
rent
was
approximately
the
same
as
our
rent,
the
trial
court
had
ordered
that
a
bond
in
the
amount
of
$700.00
be
filed
in
that
particular
case.
so
that
in
any
event,
our
bond
would've
been
something
in
the
nature
of
$500.00
to
$700.00.
and
this
again,
is
to
covered
the
rents
that
would
accrue
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
the
surety
companies
that
we
approached
asking
that
they
own
this
bond
with
us,
demanded
full
cash
collateral
before
they
would
sign
a
bond
as
well
as
demanding
their
fee.
this
was
impossible
for
our
clients
to
pay.
they
were
poor
and
they
didn't
have
that
kind
of
money.
so,
we
went
to
the
trial
court
and
by
motion
on
our
client's
behalf
to
waive
the
surety
bond.
we
stated
these
facts
to
the
trial
court
and
asked
that
as
an
alternative
in
order
to
protect
the
landlord
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
that
we
be
allowed
to
pay
the
rent
into
the
court
every
month
to
be
held
by
the
court
in
escrow.
and
we
also
agreed
that
in
the
event
that
we
should
loss
the
appeal
and
ultimately
if
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
heard
it
and
lose
there,
but
this
body
then
will
be
turn
over
to
the
landlord.
we
also
agreed
that
if
any
one
month
we
fail
to
pay
that
rent
into
the
court
that
the
appeal
could
automatically
be
dismissed.
now,
we
thought
this
was
a
fair
alternative
because
the
increase
of
the
state
has
in
protecting
the
landlord
would
be
met
entirely
by
this
provision
by
this
alternative
that
we
offered
if
we
pay
the
rent
to
the
court
every
month
as
it
came
due.
and
if
we
fail
any
one
month
and
our
appeal
would
then
be
dismissed,
the
landlord
would
have
all
the
protection
that
he
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
your
honor,
it
appears
to
us
that
it's
clear
that
they
did
not
have
that
discretion.
the
reason
i
say
that,
we
cited
in
our
appendix
the
appellate
court
decision
and
on
page
57
in
the
appendix
where
we
recited
the
decision,
the
court
says,
the
right
to
an
appeal
is
a
not
a
constitutional
one.
though
one
based
upon
privileges
of
natural
justice.
it
is
but
statutory
privilege
which
an
aggrieved
party
has
the
right
to
avail
himself
of
only
when
he
is
strictly
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
statutes.
and
later,
on
page
60
of
the
appendix,
the
appellate
division
says,
"want
a
bond
with
surety,
where
a
bond
with
surety
is
by
statute
a
prerequisite
of
review
furnishes
a
sufficient
ground
for
dismissal
of
the
appeal."
we
made
the
motion
in
the
trial
court
because
there
had
not
been
a
decision
such
as
this
with
regard
to
waiving
a
surety
bond
prior
to
this
time.
we
made
it
because
we
felt
when
we're
offering
a
fair
alternative.
it
turned
out
from
our
understanding
now
of
the
appellate
division's
decision
that
the
appellate
division
decides
that
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
waive
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
this
is
an
eviction
action
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
there
were
two
actions.
the
action
that
we're
concerned
with
was
based
on
nonpayment
of
rent.
prior
to
that,
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
offered
to
pay
the
money
in
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
appeal.
during
the
pendency
of
the
action
from
july
1967
until
the
time
of
judgment
in
january
of
68',
rent
was
not
being
paid.
now,
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
there
were
defenses
on
the
merits
that
no
rent
was
due.
our
defense
all
along
was
for
two
reasons
no
rent
was
due.
one
was
that
the
--
we
claim
that
the
landlord,
the
housing
authority,
had
not
complied
with
connecticut
statutes
and
this
is
set
forth
as
well
on
page
29
of
the
appendix.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
there're
connecticut
statutes
your
honor
that
require
that
any
building
that
is
considered
a
tenement
house
or
a
garden
type
apartment.
and
these
are
--
they
find
in
connecticut
statutes,
must
have
what
is
called
a
tenement
house
certificate
stating
that
that
building
complies
precisely
with
these
tenement
house
laws.
and
if
it
does
not
have
a
tenement
house
certificate,
then
no
rent
is
due.
and
under
a
case
cited
i
believe
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
creamy
hollow
apartments
against
louis,
no
special
proceeding
or
some
reprocess
action
can
be
brought
when
such
a
house
does
not
have
this
tenement
house
certificate.
that
was
one
of
our
defenses
as
to
the
claim
for
rent.
there
was
a
second
defense
and
that
relates
to
the
first
action
that
was
brought.
there
was
an
action
brought
some
two
months
or
three
months
before
the
second
action
which
is
an
issue
here.
that
was
brought
in
early
may
and
it
was
effort
file
the
landlord
to
put
these
people
out
for
another
reason.
that
was
our
contention
that
under
connecticut
law
that
once
a
first
action
is
brought,
there
is
no
more
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
tenant
to
pay
rent
to
the
landlord.
it's
an
obligation
to
pay
what
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
had
offered
to
pay
rent
every
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
this.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
your
honor.
that
would
pay
from
the
time
the
appeal
started
--
from
the
time
the
appeal
started
during
the
entire
pendency
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
it
would
not
pay
the
back
rent,
your
honor.
now
as
to
that
question,
there's
no
required
in
connecticut
law
that
in
order
to
defend
or
to
litigate
in
a
summary
process
action,
if
you
have
to
pay
any
rent.
in
fact
generally,
when
a
summary
process
action
is
commenced,
the
landlord
will
refuse
to
take
any
rent
because
this
would
be
a
waiver
probably
of
his
action.
litigating
and
defending
an
eviction
action
is
not
conditioned
in
connecticut
upon
paying
current
rent.
connecticut
law
does
not
require
that.
and
this
particular
factor,
we
don't
feel
as
relevant
to
this
case.
in
other
words
the
fact
that
for
several
months,
from
july
until
january
rent
was
not
paid
is
not
relevant
to
the
issue
that
we
presented
to
this
court.
if
we
had
paid
the
rent
in
full,
every
month
as
we
went
along
during
the
litigation.
we
still
would
have
come
to
the
same
problem
that
we
came
to
here.
we
would've
come
to
the
time
of
a
appeal
where
we
would
have
had
put
up
this
bond
with
a
surety.
in
other
words,
to
get
the
surety,
we
would
have
to
put
up
lump
amount
covering
perhaps
some
six
or
seven
or
eight
months
rent.
and
so
the
precise
same
issue
that's
raised
by
this
case
would
have
been
raised
even
if
every
month
we
had
been
paying
the
rent
to
the
landlord
or
into
the
court
during
the
litigation.
but
we
had
defenses
up
until
the
time
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
first
was
that
there
wasn't
any
tenement
house
certificate.
the
second
was,
that
there
had
been
a
prior
action
brought
which
terminates
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
tenant
to
pay
rent
to
the
landlord.
once
the
landlord
commences
an
eviction
action,
he
waives
his
right
to
collect
rent
and
his
effort
to
terminate
the
lease
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
collect
rent
as
such
your
honor.
he's
still
is
entitled
to
collect
whatever
the
reasonable
value
of
the
premises
are,
but
this
would
be
a
separate
matter.
these
were
our
two
defenses
during
the
cause
of
the
trial
that
rent
was
not
due
to
the
landlord.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
was
an
eviction
your
honor.
the
basis
of
that
was
they
claimed
the
nuisance
with
regard
toward
tenants.
we
defended
that.
that
never
came
to
trial,
that
action
in
fact
is
still
pending,
theoretically.
it's
never
been
withdrawn,
it
still
exist.
our
defense
is
relating
to
that
action
are
set
forth
from
the
special
defenses
that
we
had
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
the
second
action.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
was
the
allegation
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct
your
honor.
they
have
waived
it
or
they
were
stopped
to
claim
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor.
if
we
had
been
paying
--
let
us
assume
we
have
been
paying
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
each
month.
now,
if
we
paid
as
rent,
there
is
some
technical
use
of
words
in
connecticut
as
to
rent
or
use
in
occupancy.
if
we
paid
as
to
rent
and
it
was
accepted
as
rent,
this
would
operate
as
a
waiver
of
the
action.
in
other
words,
once
the
landlord
had
renewed
the
tenancy,
then
they
couldn't
continue
on
with
the
action.
well,
let
us
assume
we
didn't
pay
it
as
a
rent,
we
paid
it
as
use
in
occupancy
with
the
reasonable
value
with
the
premises
as
we
went
along.
now,
that
would
have
not
affected
to
the
court's
judgment
because
the
judgment
was
based
upon
facts
that
took
place
prior
to
this
time,
prior
to
the
continuation
of
litigation.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
nonpayment
of
rent
for
a
specific
month
which
was
back
in
the
month
of
may
which
was
what
they
were
claiming.
at
the
time
of
judgment,
i
--
if
we
are
paying
the
during
the
course
of
litigation
is,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
would
not
affected
the
court's
judgment.
at
the
time
of
judgment,
eventhough
we
were
paid
up
and
were
current,
we
still
would've
face
this
appeal
bond
which
says,
if
you
want
to
appeal,
you
have
to
put
up
a
bond
with
surety
to
cover
the
rents
that
will
accrue.
even
if
we
had
no
arrears
at
that
time,
we
would
have
to
get
a
surety
and
pay
him
say,
five
months
in
advance
or
whatever
it
would
be
that
we
would
put
down
in
the
bond,
say
$500.00
in
advance.
and
even
if
we're
current
and
had
no
arrears,
we
would
still
in
order
to
meet
this
appeal
bond
have
to
have
more
tenants
put
up
$500.00
in
there
which
they
couldn't
afford.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
eviction
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
not
necessarily
because
this
is
a
very
--
it's
a
very
technical
action.
the
action
that
was
brought
related
to
a
failure
to
pay
in
may.
the
first
action
was
brought
on
may
5th.
we
claimed
we
had
a
leeway
to
pay.
in
other
words,
they
have
been
there
for
months
before
sometimes
they
paid
on
the
10th,
sometimes
on
the
15th.
it's
a
working
family.
when
they
didn't
have
it,
they
got
a
few
days
extra
to
pay.
the
landlord
wanted
them
out
and
brought
the
action
on
the
5th
on
the
technicality
that
they
hadn't
pay
on
the
first.
now,
what
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart's
comment
today
was
if
we're
paying
in
good
faith
a
long
as
we
went
rather
not
necessarily
on
the
first
which
is
the
technical
basis
of
the
action.
but
say
on
the
15th
and
whatever
we
had
it
each
month,
wouldn't
that
affect
the
outcome.
i'm
saying
no,
that
would
not
affect
the
outcome
at
all,
because
he
would
still
get
to
the
point
of
judgment
where
the
trial
judge
say,
why
didn't
you
pay
on
the
first.
therefore,
judgment
for
the
landlord,
i
don't
care
whether
you've
been
paying
your
arrears
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor.
if
you
didn't
meet
the
terms
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
you
didn't
meet
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
the
eviction
action
were
brought
on
the
basis
of
--
then
termination
of
the
lease
for
failure
to
comply
with
it.
even
though
during
the
course
of
litigation,
we
were
paying
use
in
occupancy.
that
court
would
still
say,
that
they
were
the
judgment
of
the
landlord.
so
that
there
could've
been
a
time,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
makes
this
nonpayment
or
this
failure
to
pay
during
the
litigation
irrelevant.
there
could've
been
a
time
when
we
came
to
judgment
for
the
landlord
and
we
had
no
arrears.
we've
been
paying
this
use
of
occupancy
all
along
and
we're
still
faced
with
the
precise
question
that
were
faced
with
here.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
we
did
challenge
those
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
no
your
honor.
my
contention
as
to
that
as
well
is
that
that
finding
is
irrelevant
to
this
appeal.
that
finding
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
relates
only
to
stay
of
execution.
other
words,
we're
still
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--
because
as
i
understand
the
appellate
division
decision
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
court
to
waive
the
bond.
in
other
words,
even
if
they
thought
we
were
appealing
in
for
delay.
they
or
not
for
delay
or
in
appealing
in
good
faith
whatever
the
trial
court
may
have
found.
he
still
doesn't
have
the
discretion
to
waive
that
bond.
he
requires
the
bond
and
failure
to
put
up
the
bond
makes
a
subject
then
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
our
feeling
is
that
the
finding
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
is
not
relevant
to
the
questions
before
this
court
because
that
only
relates
to
the
stay
of
execution.
the
appellate
division's
decision
in
this
matter,
when
they
dismissed
the
appeal
and
denied
our
motion
to
review
says
nothing
about
any
delay.
it
simply
says,
that
we
failed
to
put
up
a
bond
and
that
the
bond
is
required.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
because
we
didn't
put
up
the
bond
and
the
bond
was
not
waived
because
there
was
no
authority
in
the
court
to
waive
a
bond.
any
question
of
delay
which
we
did
dispute
all
along
even
assuming
that
there
were
delay
involved
and
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
were
correct
is
not
relevant
to
this
appeal.
the
only
thing
that's
relevant
as
we
see
it,
is
the
surety
bond
which
requires
in
a
fact
that
in
advance
be
made
on
the
rent
in
lump
sum
for
some
five
or
six
months.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
under
connecticut
law,
the
question
of
delay
or
formality
doesn't
relate
to
your
being
entitle
to
appeal.
what
we
are
questioning
is
when
there
is
the
right
to
appeal,
that's
available
to
everyone
but
it's
condition
on
the
posting
of
this
bond
and
which
requires
that
you
in
a
fact
put
up
several
months
rent
in
advance.
now,
that
that
is
unconstitutional
because
it
deprives
some
constitutional,
we
claim
for
several
reasons
both
it
denies
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
it
denies
due
process.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
which
finding,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
there
was
a
motion
made
to
the
trial
court
that
we
be
entitle
to
waive
the
bond
and
at
that
time
we
filed
an
affidavit.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
believe
that's
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
and
in
the
appendix
on
page
10,
we
have
the
motion
to
where
the
surety
bond.
then,
we
have
a
financial
affidavit
of
the
tenants
on
page
12.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
don't
believe
the
court
ever
made
a
finding
your
honor.
the
court
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor
that's
is
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
he
was
working
at
series
rolebook
at
the
time.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
regularly
your
honor.
the
problem
was
this.
during
the
cause
of
the
trial,
this
man
had
a
nervous
breakdown
and
was
unemployed
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
at
the
time
of
the
appeal,
when
we
file
this
financial
affidavit,
he
then
was
working
with
series
rolebook.
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown
and
was
unemployed.
we
tried
to
obtain
welfare
assistance
for
the
family.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
an
eviction
proceeding
was
pending,
we
are
unable
to
get
assistance
from
the
welfare
upon.
this
one
of
the
background
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
that's
--
this
our
understanding
of
the
court's
opinion
that
whether
he
is
indigent
or
not
there
isn't
the
power
to
waive
the
surety
bond.
and
i
think
that's
implicit.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
the
appellate
division
as
i
understand
it
makes
a
clear
that
there
is
any
power
to
waive
the
surety
bond
that
the
surety
bond
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
don't
understand
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
you're
not
indigent?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
we
have
an
affidavit
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
but
we
have
an
affidavit
your
honor,
that
that
indicates
that
he
is
indigent.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
what
the
lower
court
said
and
that's
what
the
appellate
court
had
said
that
they
would
not
waive
the
surety
bond
because
they
didn't
feel
that
the
statute
given
the
power
to
waive
it.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
we
make
two
arguments
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection.
one
is
that
this
classification
that
as
i
say
those
--
we
can
put
up
the
surety
bond
as
suppose
to
those
who
cannot
is
without
a
reasonable
basis
the
standard
equal
protection
test.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
i'm
not
going
that
far
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
we
offered
to
pay
that
and
we
would
pay
that
and
also,
we
offered
that
if
we
fail
to
pay,
the
appeal
could
be
dismissed
forth
with
at
any
one
month
that
we
did
that.
we're
not
saying
--
we're
not
asking
that
he
need
not
pay
anything
at
all.
we
say
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
landlord
during
the
pendency
appeal.
we
might
even
had
said
that
if
were
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
state
might
have
a
legitimate
interest
during
the
previous
time.
but
that
wasn't
--
that's
not
part
of
any
state
laws.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
precisely,
i
don't
think
because
we
do
recognize
that
there
is
a
reasonable
and
legitimate
interest
that
the
state
may
have
in
protecting
land
owners.
after
a
judgment
has
rendered
in
their
favor
during
the
pendency
of
an
appeal.
what
we're
saying
is
that
it's
arbitrary
that
they
manifest
this
kind
of
interest
or
this
protection
by
in
effect
requiring
that
five
or
six
months
be
pay
all
at
once
at
one
time
which
is
impossible
for
somebody
who
can't
afford
it.
we're
saying
that
the
reasonable
way
and
the
almost
obvious
way,
that
they
could've
protect
the
interest
of
the
landlord
was
to
require
that
if
be
paid
month
by
month.
that
way,
access
to
the
courts
will
be
available
to
everybody.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
requirement
was
that
we
put
up
a
surety
bond
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
offered
to
pay
month
by
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
did
in
fact
pay
your
honor
five
months
during
the
course
of
the
entire
appeal.
there's
three
hundred
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
affidavit
was
that
we
couldn't
make
the
bond,
yes
your
honor.
but
the
rent
was
$72.00
a
month
and
each
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal
for
five
months,
thereafter.
each
month
we
deposited
$72.00
with
one
or
another
clerk
either
the
district
court
or
up
our
own
circuit
court.
so
that
there
is
now
an
effect.
in
fact,
$360.00,
which
is
on
deposit
which
has
been
deposited
$72.00
per
month
since
the
time
of
the
appeal.
we
have
been
doing
actually
what
we
offered
to
do
when
we
offered
to
deposit
money
and
ask
it
for
the
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct
your
honor.
we're
so
indigent
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
paid
only
$72.00
a
month,
we
didn't
pay
the
full
$360.00
at
one
time.
we
were
in
possession
for
five
months
after
the
time
of
the
appeal.
we
had
offered
in
our
motion
to
pay
$72.00
a
month
to
the
clerk.
this
what
was
denied
at
us.
we
were
indigent
to
the
extent
that
we
not
that
we
couldn't
pay
the
rent.
we
offered
to
pay
the
rent.
we
are
indigent
to
the
extent
that
we
couldn't
pay
the
$500.00
for
the
surety
which
would
have
been
required
in
order
to
put
up
the
surety
bond.
we
could
pay
our
rent
monthly
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
no,
your
honor.
that
would
cover
that,
if
we
put
up
the
surety
bond
that
would
cover
the
landlord
for
that
period
of
time
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
we
didn't
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
the
full
amount
of
the
rent.
we
had
the
monthly
rent.
we
didn't
have
the
five
months
rent
to
put
down
all
at
one
time.
see
the
surety
bond
required
that
we
put
down
in
lump.
five
times
or
six
times
each
month's
rent.
it
would
be
something
like
$400.00
to
$500.00
in
lump
sum
at
that
time.
we
didn't
have
that
money.
we
did
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
rent
each
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
or
whenever
as
it
came
due
in
the
amount
of
$72.00.
which
is
what
we
did
and
there
is
now
$360.00
available
to
the
landlord.
but,
that
was
only
--
we
are
only
able
to
pay
$72.00
a
month.
we
weren't
unable
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
have
defenses
your
honor,
regardless
whether
we
pay.
we
had
defenses
on
the
rent.
the
technicality
of
connecticut
law
is
that
you
pay
on
the
first
according
to
the
lease.
we
had
defenses
that
there
had
been
and
established
practice
that
rent
was
accepted
late.
this
was
a
housing
authority
--
mr.
francis

i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis

many
times

or

something
like

when

this
is
a

mr.

yes,
your

because
--
mr.
francis

he
could've
pay

the
fact
was
that
the
action
was
brought
at
an
early
time,
as
i
said
on
the
5th
of
may
without
giving
him
opportunity
to
pay
the
rent
for

in
fact,
prior
to
may
in

--
mr.
francis

dineen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
three
or
four
days,
your
honor.
mr.
francis

dineen
no,
your
honor,
they
started
the
action.
they
would
not
take
it
at
that
time
once
they
started
the
action
and
as
i
said,
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
started
the
action
on
the
basis
of
a
nuisance
because
this
really
was
not
essentially
a
nonpayment
case.
they
wanted
to
evict
this
tenant
originally
on
the
basis
of
nuisance.
but,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
there
is
a
right
to
a
writ
of
restitution
in
connecticut,
so
that
this
tenant
can
get
back
into
the
housing
authority
should
we
win
on
appeal.
mr.
francis

dineen
no,
they
are
not
your

but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
connecticut
does
allow
of
writ
the
restitution,
so
that
we
can
get
back
into
the
housing
authority,
should
we
win
on
appeal.
mr.
francis

dineen
no,
your

not
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
appellate
division
was
concerned
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
our
motion
to
review
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
in
denying
our
motion
to
waive
the
surety

and
they

mr.

mr.
chief

--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
francis
x.
dineen.
i
represent
the
appellants
in
this
matter.
jurisdiction
of
this
court
has
invoked
under
28
united
states
code,
section
1257,
subsection
2
because
of
the
fact
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
as
an
issue.
and
by
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
constitutionality
of
that
state
statute
has
been
upheld.
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
denied
our
petition
for
certification
and
so
the
appeal
to
this
court
is
from
the
appellant's
division
of
the
circuit
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
involve
a
relatively
ordinary
eviction
action
which
was
commenced
in
july
of
1967.
thereafter,
pleadings
were
filed
and
defenses
were
raised
and
in
fact
seven
special
defenses
were
raised
to
the
eviction
action
that
was
brought.
in
january
of
1968,
a
trial
took
place.
on
january
16,
judgment
was
entered
for
the
landlord,
the
housing
authority
of
west
haven.
thereafter
on
january
18,
our
appeal
from
that
judgment
was
filed
with
the
appellate
division.
at
that
time,
pursuant
to
section
52-542
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
it
was
required
that
we
file
with
the
court
a
bond
with
a
surety
to
cover
the
rents
that
might
accrue
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
and
in
order
to
file
that
bond,
on
behalf
of
our
clients,
we
went
to
several
surety
companies
asking
them
what
they
would
require
to
go
on
the
bond
as
a
surety.
the
bond
in
this
case
because
the
rent
was
$72.00
per
month
would
have
been
approximately
something
in
the
nature
of
$400.00
to
$500.00
or
even
more
dollars
for
this
bond.
in
fact,
that
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
rent
was
approximately
the
same
as
our
rent,
the
trial
court
had
ordered
that
a
bond
in
the
amount
of
$700.00
be
filed
in
that
particular
case.
so
that
in
any
event,
our
bond
would've
been
something
in
the
nature
of
$500.00
to
$700.00.
and
this
again,
is
to
covered
the
rents
that
would
accrue
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
the
surety
companies
that
we
approached
asking
that
they
own
this
bond
with
us,
demanded
full
cash
collateral
before
they
would
sign
a
bond
as
well
as
demanding
their
fee.
this
was
impossible
for
our
clients
to
pay.
they
were
poor
and
they
didn't
have
that
kind
of
money.
so,
we
went
to
the
trial
court
and
by
motion
on
our
client's
behalf
to
waive
the
surety
bond.
we
stated
these
facts
to
the
trial
court
and
asked
that
as
an
alternative
in
order
to
protect
the
landlord
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
that
we
be
allowed
to
pay
the
rent
into
the
court
every
month
to
be
held
by
the
court
in
escrow.
and
we
also
agreed
that
in
the
event
that
we
should
loss
the
appeal
and
ultimately
if
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
heard
it
and
lose
there,
but
this
body
then
will
be
turn
over
to
the
landlord.
we
also
agreed
that
if
any
one
month
we
fail
to
pay
that
rent
into
the
court
that
the
appeal
could
automatically
be
dismissed.
now,
we
thought
this
was
a
fair
alternative
because
the
increase
of
the
state
has
in
protecting
the
landlord
would
be
met
entirely
by
this
provision
by
this
alternative
that
we
offered
if
we
pay
the
rent
to
the
court
every
month
as
it
came
due.
and
if
we
fail
any
one
month
and
our
appeal
would
then
be
dismissed,
the
landlord
would
have
all
the
protection
that
he
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
your
honor,
it
appears
to
us
that
it's
clear
that
they
did
not
have
that
discretion.
the
reason
i
say
that,
we
cited
in
our
appendix
the
appellate
court
decision
and
on
page
57
in
the
appendix
where
we
recited
the
decision,
the
court
says,
the
right
to
an
appeal
is
a
not
a
constitutional
one.
though
one
based
upon
privileges
of
natural
justice.
it
is
but
statutory
privilege
which
an
aggrieved
party
has
the
right
to
avail
himself
of
only
when
he
is
strictly
complied
with
the
provisions
of
the
statutes.
and
later,
on
page
60
of
the
appendix,
the
appellate
division
says,
"want
a
bond
with
surety,
where
a
bond
with
surety
is
by
statute
a
prerequisite
of
review
furnishes
a
sufficient
ground
for
dismissal
of
the
appeal."
we
made
the
motion
in
the
trial
court
because
there
had
not
been
a
decision
such
as
this
with
regard
to
waiving
a
surety
bond
prior
to
this
time.
we
made
it
because
we
felt
when
we're
offering
a
fair
alternative.
it
turned
out
from
our
understanding
now
of
the
appellate
division's
decision
that
the
appellate
division
decides
that
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
waive
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
this
is
an
eviction
action
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
there
were
two
actions.
the
action
that
we're
concerned
with
was
based
on
nonpayment
of
rent.
prior
to
that,
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
offered
to
pay
the
money
in
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
appeal.
during
the
pendency
of
the
action
from
july
1967
until
the
time
of
judgment
in
january
of
68',
rent
was
not
being
paid.
now,
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
there
were
defenses
on
the
merits
that
no
rent
was
due.
our
defense
all
along
was
for
two
reasons
no
rent
was
due.
one
was
that
the
--
we
claim
that
the
landlord,
the
housing
authority,
had
not
complied
with
connecticut
statutes
and
this
is
set
forth
as
well
on
page
29
of
the
appendix.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
there're
connecticut
statutes
your
honor
that
require
that
any
building
that
is
considered
a
tenement
house
or
a
garden
type
apartment.
and
these
are
--
they
find
in
connecticut
statutes,
must
have
what
is
called
a
tenement
house
certificate
stating
that
that
building
complies
precisely
with
these
tenement
house
laws.
and
if
it
does
not
have
a
tenement
house
certificate,
then
no
rent
is
due.
and
under
a
case
cited
i
believe
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
creamy
hollow
apartments
against
louis,
no
special
proceeding
or
some
reprocess
action
can
be
brought
when
such
a
house
does
not
have
this
tenement
house
certificate.
that
was
one
of
our
defenses
as
to
the
claim
for
rent.
there
was
a
second
defense
and
that
relates
to
the
first
action
that
was
brought.
there
was
an
action
brought
some
two
months
or
three
months
before
the
second
action
which
is
an
issue
here.
that
was
brought
in
early
may
and
it
was
effort
file
the
landlord
to
put
these
people
out
for
another
reason.
that
was
our
contention
that
under
connecticut
law
that
once
a
first
action
is
brought,
there
is
no
more
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
tenant
to
pay
rent
to
the
landlord.
it's
an
obligation
to
pay
what
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
had
offered
to
pay
rent
every
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
this.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
your
honor.
that
would
pay
from
the
time
the
appeal
started
--
from
the
time
the
appeal
started
during
the
entire
pendency
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
it
would
not
pay
the
back
rent,
your
honor.
now
as
to
that
question,
there's
no
required
in
connecticut
law
that
in
order
to
defend
or
to
litigate
in
a
summary
process
action,
if
you
have
to
pay
any
rent.
in
fact
generally,
when
a
summary
process
action
is
commenced,
the
landlord
will
refuse
to
take
any
rent
because
this
would
be
a
waiver
probably
of
his
action.
litigating
and
defending
an
eviction
action
is
not
conditioned
in
connecticut
upon
paying
current
rent.
connecticut
law
does
not
require
that.
and
this
particular
factor,
we
don't
feel
as
relevant
to
this
case.
in
other
words
the
fact
that
for
several
months,
from
july
until
january
rent
was
not
paid
is
not
relevant
to
the
issue
that
we
presented
to
this
court.
if
we
had
paid
the
rent
in
full,
every
month
as
we
went
along
during
the
litigation.
we
still
would
have
come
to
the
same
problem
that
we
came
to
here.
we
would've
come
to
the
time
of
a
appeal
where
we
would
have
had
put
up
this
bond
with
a
surety.
in
other
words,
to
get
the
surety,
we
would
have
to
put
up
lump
amount
covering
perhaps
some
six
or
seven
or
eight
months
rent.
and
so
the
precise
same
issue
that's
raised
by
this
case
would
have
been
raised
even
if
every
month
we
had
been
paying
the
rent
to
the
landlord
or
into
the
court
during
the
litigation.
but
we
had
defenses
up
until
the
time
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
first
was
that
there
wasn't
any
tenement
house
certificate.
the
second
was,
that
there
had
been
a
prior
action
brought
which
terminates
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
tenant
to
pay
rent
to
the
landlord.
once
the
landlord
commences
an
eviction
action,
he
waives
his
right
to
collect
rent
and
his
effort
to
terminate
the
lease
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
collect
rent
as
such
your
honor.
he's
still
is
entitled
to
collect
whatever
the
reasonable
value
of
the
premises
are,
but
this
would
be
a
separate
matter.
these
were
our
two
defenses
during
the
cause
of
the
trial
that
rent
was
not
due
to
the
landlord.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
was
an
eviction
your
honor.
the
basis
of
that
was
they
claimed
the
nuisance
with
regard
toward
tenants.
we
defended
that.
that
never
came
to
trial,
that
action
in
fact
is
still
pending,
theoretically.
it's
never
been
withdrawn,
it
still
exist.
our
defense
is
relating
to
that
action
are
set
forth
from
the
special
defenses
that
we
had
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
the
second
action.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that
was
the
allegation
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct
your
honor.
they
have
waived
it
or
they
were
stopped
to
claim
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor.
if
we
had
been
paying
--
let
us
assume
we
have
been
paying
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
each
month.
now,
if
we
paid
as
rent,
there
is
some
technical
use
of
words
in
connecticut
as
to
rent
or
use
in
occupancy.
if
we
paid
as
to
rent
and
it
was
accepted
as
rent,
this
would
operate
as
a
waiver
of
the
action.
in
other
words,
once
the
landlord
had
renewed
the
tenancy,
then
they
couldn't
continue
on
with
the
action.
well,
let
us
assume
we
didn't
pay
it
as
a
rent,
we
paid
it
as
use
in
occupancy
with
the
reasonable
value
with
the
premises
as
we
went
along.
now,
that
would
have
not
affected
to
the
court's
judgment
because
the
judgment
was
based
upon
facts
that
took
place
prior
to
this
time,
prior
to
the
continuation
of
litigation.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
nonpayment
of
rent
for
a
specific
month
which
was
back
in
the
month
of
may
which
was
what
they
were
claiming.
at
the
time
of
judgment,
i
--
if
we
are
paying
the
during
the
course
of
litigation
is,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
would
not
affected
the
court's
judgment.
at
the
time
of
judgment,
eventhough
we
were
paid
up
and
were
current,
we
still
would've
face
this
appeal
bond
which
says,
if
you
want
to
appeal,
you
have
to
put
up
a
bond
with
surety
to
cover
the
rents
that
will
accrue.
even
if
we
had
no
arrears
at
that
time,
we
would
have
to
get
a
surety
and
pay
him
say,
five
months
in
advance
or
whatever
it
would
be
that
we
would
put
down
in
the
bond,
say
$500.00
in
advance.
and
even
if
we're
current
and
had
no
arrears,
we
would
still
in
order
to
meet
this
appeal
bond
have
to
have
more
tenants
put
up
$500.00
in
there
which
they
couldn't
afford.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
eviction
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
not
necessarily
because
this
is
a
very
--
it's
a
very
technical
action.
the
action
that
was
brought
related
to
a
failure
to
pay
in
may.
the
first
action
was
brought
on
may
5th.
we
claimed
we
had
a
leeway
to
pay.
in
other
words,
they
have
been
there
for
months
before
sometimes
they
paid
on
the
10th,
sometimes
on
the
15th.
it's
a
working
family.
when
they
didn't
have
it,
they
got
a
few
days
extra
to
pay.
the
landlord
wanted
them
out
and
brought
the
action
on
the
5th
on
the
technicality
that
they
hadn't
pay
on
the
first.
now,
what
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart's
comment
today
was
if
we're
paying
in
good
faith
a
long
as
we
went
rather
not
necessarily
on
the
first
which
is
the
technical
basis
of
the
action.
but
say
on
the
15th
and
whatever
we
had
it
each
month,
wouldn't
that
affect
the
outcome.
i'm
saying
no,
that
would
not
affect
the
outcome
at
all,
because
he
would
still
get
to
the
point
of
judgment
where
the
trial
judge
say,
why
didn't
you
pay
on
the
first.
therefore,
judgment
for
the
landlord,
i
don't
care
whether
you've
been
paying
your
arrears
or
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor.
if
you
didn't
meet
the
terms
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
you
didn't
meet
the
terms
of
the
lease
and
the
eviction
action
were
brought
on
the
basis
of
--
then
termination
of
the
lease
for
failure
to
comply
with
it.
even
though
during
the
course
of
litigation,
we
were
paying
use
in
occupancy.
that
court
would
still
say,
that
they
were
the
judgment
of
the
landlord.
so
that
there
could've
been
a
time,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
makes
this
nonpayment
or
this
failure
to
pay
during
the
litigation
irrelevant.
there
could've
been
a
time
when
we
came
to
judgment
for
the
landlord
and
we
had
no
arrears.
we've
been
paying
this
use
of
occupancy
all
along
and
we're
still
faced
with
the
precise
question
that
were
faced
with
here.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
we
did
challenge
those
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
no
your
honor.
my
contention
as
to
that
as
well
is
that
that
finding
is
irrelevant
to
this
appeal.
that
finding
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
relates
only
to
stay
of
execution.
other
words,
we're
still
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
--
because
as
i
understand
the
appellate
division
decision
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
court
to
waive
the
bond.
in
other
words,
even
if
they
thought
we
were
appealing
in
for
delay.
they
or
not
for
delay
or
in
appealing
in
good
faith
whatever
the
trial
court
may
have
found.
he
still
doesn't
have
the
discretion
to
waive
that
bond.
he
requires
the
bond
and
failure
to
put
up
the
bond
makes
a
subject
then
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
our
feeling
is
that
the
finding
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
is
not
relevant
to
the
questions
before
this
court
because
that
only
relates
to
the
stay
of
execution.
the
appellate
division's
decision
in
this
matter,
when
they
dismissed
the
appeal
and
denied
our
motion
to
review
says
nothing
about
any
delay.
it
simply
says,
that
we
failed
to
put
up
a
bond
and
that
the
bond
is
required.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
because
we
didn't
put
up
the
bond
and
the
bond
was
not
waived
because
there
was
no
authority
in
the
court
to
waive
a
bond.
any
question
of
delay
which
we
did
dispute
all
along
even
assuming
that
there
were
delay
involved
and
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
were
correct
is
not
relevant
to
this
appeal.
the
only
thing
that's
relevant
as
we
see
it,
is
the
surety
bond
which
requires
in
a
fact
that
in
advance
be
made
on
the
rent
in
lump
sum
for
some
five
or
six
months.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i'm
not
arguing
that
your
honor.
under
connecticut
law,
the
question
of
delay
or
formality
doesn't
relate
to
your
being
entitle
to
appeal.
what
we
are
questioning
is
when
there
is
the
right
to
appeal,
that's
available
to
everyone
but
it's
condition
on
the
posting
of
this
bond
and
which
requires
that
you
in
a
fact
put
up
several
months
rent
in
advance.
now,
that
that
is
unconstitutional
because
it
deprives
some
constitutional,
we
claim
for
several
reasons
both
it
denies
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
it
denies
due
process.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
which
finding,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
there
was
a
motion
made
to
the
trial
court
that
we
be
entitle
to
waive
the
bond
and
at
that
time
we
filed
an
affidavit.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
believe
that's
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
and
in
the
appendix
on
page
10,
we
have
the
motion
to
where
the
surety
bond.
then,
we
have
a
financial
affidavit
of
the
tenants
on
page
12.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
don't
believe
the
court
ever
made
a
finding
your
honor.
the
court
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes
your
honor
that's
is
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
he
was
working
at
series
rolebook
at
the
time.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
regularly
your
honor.
the
problem
was
this.
during
the
cause
of
the
trial,
this
man
had
a
nervous
breakdown
and
was
unemployed
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
at
the
time
of
the
appeal,
when
we
file
this
financial
affidavit,
he
then
was
working
with
series
rolebook.
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown
and
was
unemployed.
we
tried
to
obtain
welfare
assistance
for
the
family.
but
because
of
the
fact
that
an
eviction
proceeding
was
pending,
we
are
unable
to
get
assistance
from
the
welfare
upon.
this
one
of
the
background
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
that's
--
this
our
understanding
of
the
court's
opinion
that
whether
he
is
indigent
or
not
there
isn't
the
power
to
waive
the
surety
bond.
and
i
think
that's
implicit.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
the
appellate
division
as
i
understand
it
makes
a
clear
that
there
is
any
power
to
waive
the
surety
bond
that
the
surety
bond
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
don't
understand
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
you're
not
indigent?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
we
have
an
affidavit
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
but
we
have
an
affidavit
your
honor,
that
that
indicates
that
he
is
indigent.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
what
the
lower
court
said
and
that's
what
the
appellate
court
had
said
that
they
would
not
waive
the
surety
bond
because
they
didn't
feel
that
the
statute
given
the
power
to
waive
it.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
well,
we
make
two
arguments
on
the
basis
of
equal
protection.
one
is
that
this
classification
that
as
i
say
those
--
we
can
put
up
the
surety
bond
as
suppose
to
those
who
cannot
is
without
a
reasonable
basis
the
standard
equal
protection
test.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
i'm
not
going
that
far
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
we
offered
to
pay
that
and
we
would
pay
that
and
also,
we
offered
that
if
we
fail
to
pay,
the
appeal
could
be
dismissed
forth
with
at
any
one
month
that
we
did
that.
we're
not
saying
--
we're
not
asking
that
he
need
not
pay
anything
at
all.
we
say
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
the
landlord
during
the
pendency
appeal.
we
might
even
had
said
that
if
were
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
state
might
have
a
legitimate
interest
during
the
previous
time.
but
that
wasn't
--
that's
not
part
of
any
state
laws.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
precisely,
i
don't
think
because
we
do
recognize
that
there
is
a
reasonable
and
legitimate
interest
that
the
state
may
have
in
protecting
land
owners.
after
a
judgment
has
rendered
in
their
favor
during
the
pendency
of
an
appeal.
what
we're
saying
is
that
it's
arbitrary
that
they
manifest
this
kind
of
interest
or
this
protection
by
in
effect
requiring
that
five
or
six
months
be
pay
all
at
once
at
one
time
which
is
impossible
for
somebody
who
can't
afford
it.
we're
saying
that
the
reasonable
way
and
the
almost
obvious
way,
that
they
could've
protect
the
interest
of
the
landlord
was
to
require
that
if
be
paid
month
by
month.
that
way,
access
to
the
courts
will
be
available
to
everybody.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
requirement
was
that
we
put
up
a
surety
bond
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
offered
to
pay
month
by
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
did
in
fact
pay
your
honor
five
months
during
the
course
of
the
entire
appeal.
there's
three
hundred
and
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
affidavit
was
that
we
couldn't
make
the
bond,
yes
your
honor.
but
the
rent
was
$72.00
a
month
and
each
month
from
the
time
of
the
appeal
for
five
months,
thereafter.
each
month
we
deposited
$72.00
with
one
or
another
clerk
either
the
district
court
or
up
our
own
circuit
court.
so
that
there
is
now
an
effect.
in
fact,
$360.00,
which
is
on
deposit
which
has
been
deposited
$72.00
per
month
since
the
time
of
the
appeal.
we
have
been
doing
actually
what
we
offered
to
do
when
we
offered
to
deposit
money
and
ask
it
for
the
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
that's
correct
your
honor.
we're
so
indigent
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
paid
only
$72.00
a
month,
we
didn't
pay
the
full
$360.00
at
one
time.
we
were
in
possession
for
five
months
after
the
time
of
the
appeal.
we
had
offered
in
our
motion
to
pay
$72.00
a
month
to
the
clerk.
this
what
was
denied
at
us.
we
were
indigent
to
the
extent
that
we
not
that
we
couldn't
pay
the
rent.
we
offered
to
pay
the
rent.
we
are
indigent
to
the
extent
that
we
couldn't
pay
the
$500.00
for
the
surety
which
would
have
been
required
in
order
to
put
up
the
surety
bond.
we
could
pay
our
rent
monthly
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
no,
your
honor.
that
would
cover
that,
if
we
put
up
the
surety
bond
that
would
cover
the
landlord
for
that
period
of
time
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
we
didn't
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
the
full
amount
of
the
rent.
we
had
the
monthly
rent.
we
didn't
have
the
five
months
rent
to
put
down
all
at
one
time.
see
the
surety
bond
required
that
we
put
down
in
lump.
five
times
or
six
times
each
month's
rent.
it
would
be
something
like
$400.00
to
$500.00
in
lump
sum
at
that
time.
we
didn't
have
that
money.
we
did
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
rent
each
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
or
whenever
as
it
came
due
in
the
amount
of
$72.00.
which
is
what
we
did
and
there
is
now
$360.00
available
to
the
landlord.
but,
that
was
only
--
we
are
only
able
to
pay
$72.00
a
month.
we
weren't
unable
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
we
have
defenses
your
honor,
regardless
whether
we
pay.
we
had
defenses
on
the
rent.
the
technicality
of
connecticut
law
is
that
you
pay
on
the
first
according
to
the
lease.
we
had
defenses
that
there
had
been
and
established
practice
that
rent
was
accepted
late.
this
was
a
housing
authority
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
many
times
the
jury
depending
on
the
tenant
it
might
be
the
10th
or
the
15th
or
something
like
that.
depending
on
when
the
tenant
had
it.
this
is
a
housing
authority.
these
are
low
income
tax
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
yes,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
he
could've
pay
the
rent.
the
fact
was
that
the
action
was
brought
at
an
early
time,
as
i
said
on
the
5th
of
may
without
giving
him
opportunity
to
pay
the
rent
for
may.
in
fact,
prior
to
may
in
april
--
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
three
or
four
days,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
your
honor,
they
started
the
action.
they
would
not
take
it
at
that
time
once
they
started
the
action
and
as
i
said,
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
started
the
action
on
the
basis
of
a
nuisance
because
this
really
was
not
essentially
a
nonpayment
case.
they
wanted
to
evict
this
tenant
originally
on
the
basis
of
nuisance.
but,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
there
is
a
right
to
a
writ
of
restitution
in
connecticut,
so
that
this
tenant
can
get
back
into
the
housing
authority
should
we
win
on
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
they
are
not
your
honor.
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
connecticut
does
allow
of
writ
the
restitution,
so
that
we
can
get
back
into
the
housing
authority,
should
we
win
on
appeal.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
no,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
not
at
all.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
the
appellate
division
was
concerned
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
our
motion
to
review
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
in
denying
our
motion
to
waive
the
surety
bond
and
they
dismissed
the
appeal
first
day
in
put
up
the
surety
bond.
mr.
francis
x.
dineen
if
i
may
justice
douglas,
this
is
the
position
of
the
appellants.
