justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
would
you
lose
if
you
paid
the
rent?
so
i
understand
you
said
this
would
pay
you
to
pay
rent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
did
pay
rent,
you'd
win.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
connecticut
court
would
say
that
for
the
past
six
months
you
paid
$72.00
everyday,
every
month
on
the
second,
therefore,
you
are
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
the
court
would
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
--
was
the
other
case
pending
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
was
it
pending
during
that
three-month
period
that
you
say
they
didn't
pay
their
rent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
he
correct
that
when
a
case
dispossess
the
case
that
pending
you
don't
use
the
pay
rent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
wasn't
it
carried
through?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
was
brought
about
by
the
first
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
first
action.
so,
then
you
filed
the
second
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
now
you
got
a
clearly
not
paying
their
rent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it's
not
their
claim
that
you've
never
withdrawn
the
first
case,
still
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
defending
the
real
issue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you're
not
responsible
for
what
they
did
of
course,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
just
don't
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ahern,
do
you
know
in
connecticut
that
the
court
waive
a
close
bond
should
be
bond,
couldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
those
come
over
here
too
that
seem
to
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
problem
i
really
have
is
why
the
argument
is
made
by
the
appellate
court
could
not
legally
waive
the
surety
bond.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
that
show
means
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
do
see
of
equal
protection
problem
it
shall
mean
what
it
says,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
have
big
difficulty
on
the
landlord
in
all
when
they
paid
this
$72.00
a
month
into
court.
it's
all
the
landlord
was
entitled
to?
it
was
in
court
and
any
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
they
fail
to
pay
it,
they
loss
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
am
i
wrong
that
if
that
stage,
if
they
put
up
a
surety
bond
they
didn't
have
to
pay
their
nine
months
behind,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying
as
of
this.
the
alternative
the
surety
bond
or
$72.00
a
month
into
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
--
was
solely
for
the
protection
of
the
landlord.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
did
he
had
ever
surety
bond
when
he
was
sure
of
his
rent
--
$72.00
a
month?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
didn't
--
with
the
surety
bond
wouldn't
call
that
nine
months
in
arrears
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
far
is
that
particular
point
to
nine
months
are
arrears
is
out
of
the
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see
them
less
then
two
hours.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood

how
would
you
