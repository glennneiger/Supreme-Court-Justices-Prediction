what
did
you
say
the
suit
was
filed
for?
justice

black
it
--
nonpayment
of
rent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
offered
to
pay
the
money
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
connecticut
statutes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
offered
to
pay
the
rent
first,
plus
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
that
you
say
awhile
ago,
you
had
offered
to
pay
rent
plus
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
pay
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
pay
all
the
man
was
claiming,
that
company
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
it
pay
the
back
rent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
your
second
defense
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
waives
his
right
to
collect
rent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
finding
you
made
was
indicated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
finding
of
facts
about
whether
they
were
of
indulgence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
where's
the
finding
of
the
court
whether
there
was
indulgence
shown?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
did
he
show
what
the
man
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
his
occupation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
regularly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
course
of
the
trial
of
before
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
agreed
to
get
some
kind
of
fund
in
the
court?
shall
be
reward
indigent
or
you
bring
the
case
all
of
at
the
end?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there's
not
if
it's
in
theoretical
thing,
why
should
we
have
it
up
beyond
the
constitutional
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
does
not
and
suppose
he
doesn't
need
this
waive.
would
you
still
claim
you
could
get
a
decision
on
the
constitutional
question
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
not
an
essential,
would
you
still
claim
that
eventhough
you're
not
indigent
you
could
get
it
it's
not
constitutional
question
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
there's
no
finding
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
you
say
you
can
get
to
that
issue
without
having
something
or
some
kind
of
find
or
of
something
to
show
that
really
you
use
any
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
is
there
any
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
since,
we
were
denied
and
as
i
understand
on
the
basis
because
indigency
is
irrelevant
because
the
surety
bond
is
required.
i
think
that
raises
the
constitutional
question.
we're
claiming
that
person
was
indigent.
the
court
has
denied
us,
our
request
to
waive
the
surety
bond
regardless
of
whether
he
is
indigent.
i
think
that's
enough
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
to
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
has
waived
$50,000.00.
would
still
say
that
the
court
had
to
consider
that
he
was
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
you
just
say
that's
irrelevant
whether
he
was
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
months
did
you
offer
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
about
this,
but
how
much
money,
you
should
you
attempt
to
offer
to
payment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
months
did
you
offer
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
handed
an
affidavit
of
indigency
not
be
in
able
to
make
the
bond?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that's
the
issue
why
didn't
you
have
the
money
which
was
liquid
to
put
it
to
court?
how
could
you
claim
if
one
debt
that
you
don't
have
it
and
pay
it
into
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
needn't
to
pay
$500.00
indigent
to
put
up
the
money
for
the
rent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
had
the
money
to
pay
that
bond
just
the
same
as
you
had
the
money
to
put
in
the
court,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
able
to
pay
that
before
he
sued
you,
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
sued,
would
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
test
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
no
more
than
a
test
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
really
--
do
you
really
have
a
genuine
litigation
here?
justice

black
why
couldn't
they
pay
the
rent?
justice

black
four
days?
justice

black
three
or
four
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
decline
to
take
in?
justice

black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statement
of
page
20?
in
fact
it
end
25.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
said
you
told
me
that
to
the
counsel.
i
am
satisfied
that
you're,
i'm
satisfied
in
all
these
monkey
business
as
it
go
in
have
been
successful
so
far
as
keeping
them
in
here
and
not
paying
any
rent.
the
legislature
must
have
that
something
in
mind
when
it
brought
here
unless
it
appears
to
the
judge
to
find
the
case
that
the
appeal
was
taken
for
the
previous
of
delay.
what
was
he
quoting
from?
can't
find
it?
justice

black
here
on
page
20.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
last
paragraph.
justice
hugo

he
purported
to
the
reading
from
the
statute.
justice

black
that
is
what
you
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unless
what?
justice

well,

what's
the
premise
on
which
that
unless
is
based?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
we
have
findings
here
that
this
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay?
are
you
arguing
that
settles
the
case
under
that
statute?
justice

why
doesn't
if
that's
the
statute?
justice

why
does
it
not?
and
you
have
argue
that
they
made
any
argument.
