chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
clear
mr.
dineen
that
the
court
have
the
power
by
way
of
equity,
discretion
or
some
other
source
to
waive
the
bond
requirement
and
accept
your
alternative
proposal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dineen,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
one
opinion
clear
there
were
some
findings
here
and
then
there
are
some
colloquy
in
the
record
which
would
seem
to
explain
the
findings.
and
i'm
not
sure
to
--
in
which
action
this
took
place.
the
finding
i'm
referring
to,
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
at
the
first
instance
that
this
appeal
was
taken
for
purposes
of
delay
and
not
in
good
faith.
now,
do
you
challenge
those
findings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
if
those
findings,
let's
assume
first
that
you
are
right
from
--
and
that
the
findings
are
in
error,
do
we
review
a
finding
of
the
court
at
the
first
instance
of
the
state
on
a
factual
issue
in
which
undoubtedly
credibility
and
other
similar
factors
are

chief

was
it
not
also
relate
to
whether
a
bond
would
be
accepted
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

--
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
believe
that's
finding
one
and
two,
i'm
sure
what
page
it's
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
equal
protection
on
your
argument
to
--
is
an
absolute
requirement
that
there
must
be
a
right
to
appeal
and
still
having
some
difficulties
seeing
whether
it
makes
any
difference.
but
there
is
another
way
to
protect
the
appellee
in
this
case
the
housing
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
it
make
a
difference
to
your
case
whether
you
could
or
could
not
put
up
the
rent
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal?
suppose
he
could
not
pay
the
rent
at
all
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
would
your
position
be
different
here
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you're
right
and
if
your
position
is
some
on
the
equal
protection
ground,
would
you
posture
not
be
the
same,
if
you
didn't
have
a
dime
to
pay
into
the
treasury
of
the
court
or
refuse
to
pay
it?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.
ahern.
chief

warren
e.
burger
now,
what's
the
states
connection
of
the
housing
authority?
chief

e.

this
is
a

chief

this

would
a
bond
if
the
court
decided
this
was
not
for

but
it
was
on
good
faith,
could
you
then
stay
the
execution
of
the
judgment
without
a
bond?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
crux
of
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
trial
judge
seems
to
have
at
least
given
some
consideration
to
the
idea
that
he
first
found
that
the
appeal
was
taken
in
good
faith
and
not
the
purposes
of
delay,
then
he
would
considerably
questioned

then
i
won't
give
any
further
thought
to
the
alternative

of

the
clerk
for
the
legal
assistance
association
to
hold
the
rent
in

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
appellate
court
didn't
approach
that
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
least
six
times
by
my
count
here.
the
trial
judge
referred
affirmatively
and
not
ambiguously
at
times
to
the
reasons
why
he
thought
this
appeal
was
taken
for
purposes
of
delay.
but
as
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
the
appellate
division
never
mentioned
that.
i
would
like
--
i
would
hope
when
you
file
the
supplemental
memorandum
that
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
that
you
give
us
your
view
of
why
something
which
the
trial
court
emphasize
somewhat
and
so
often
was
not
referred
to
by
the
appellate
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
this
housing
authority
like
most
public
housing
authorities
has
a
waiving
list
of
other
poor
people
who
are
or
claim
to
be

also
notes

with
some
emphasize

read
it
to

the
review
of
the

depending
on
what

the
