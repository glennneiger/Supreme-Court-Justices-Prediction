what
was
the
basis
of
the
prior
action?
was
that
also
an
eviction
action?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
was
the
first
action
in
the
eviction
action
because
your
clients
have
allegedly
were
committing
a
nuisance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
and
that's
never
been
resolved.
and
then
there
was
a
second
eviction
action
based
upon
to
nonpayment
of
rent.
and
you
had
two
defenses.
first,
that
since
they
didn't
have
a
certificate,
they
couldn't
ask
you
for
rent?
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly,
since
they
brought
this
earlier
action,
they
didn't
have
any
right
to
ask
you
for
rent
as
such
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
understand,
how
you
can
say
that
if
you
had
kept
paying
rent
this
question
would
still
have
arisen
because
if
you
had
i
suppose
in
this
action
which
is
only
based
on
a
nonpayment
of
rent,
it
couldn't
have
arisen.
there
would've
not
been
an
appeal,
there
wouldn't
have
not
been
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
nonpayment
of
rent
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
defend
if
you
--
while
you
approach
this
issues
about
the
statute
on
this
face
and
the
statute
in
the
trial.
if
you're
arguing
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
state
could
not
insist
about
security
and
in
appeal
in
a
situation
where
it
made
the
determination,
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous
unless
you
can
take
it
for
the
purpose
in
july,
are
arguing
that?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
the
family
now?
are
they
in
the
housing?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
the
judge
dehenzel
--
justice
potter
stewart
dehenzel
and
that's
justice
who
is
denial
on
page
23
of
this
appendix
together
and
the
full
hearing
to
which
you
referred
that
appears
on

of

is
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
same
judge
dehenzel
had
decided
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
landlord?
justice

stewart
and
that
i
guess
it's
not
in
the

that
hearing
is
not

is
it
not?

the
judgment
is

seven
or

thank
you.
justice

what's
happened
to
the
$360.00?
justice

stewart
that
statute
mr.
ahern
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggest
that
if
it's
the
one
appearing
on
page
4
of
the
appellate
brief.
justice

stewart
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
requirement
of
a
surety
bond,
does
it?
it's
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
and
i
understand
it,
you
don't
have
any
records
on,
is
that
correct?
is
that
federal
--
justice

the
only
kind
of
authority,
i
guess,
is

division's
opinion
in
this
case,
is
it?

mr.

do
you

the
appellate
division
of
the
circuit
court
of
april
11,
1968
appearing
on

66
of

throws
any
lie
upon
the
question
in
which
mr.

douglas
and
the
chief

expressed
an
interest?
that
is
whether
or
not
the
appellate
division
decided
the
case
on
the
quite
absolute
and
inflexible
basis
or
whether
if
adopted
the
part
at

the
reasoning
of

court?
justice

this

here
has
to
do
with
finally
the
vacation
of
the
stay
of
execution,
is
it
not?
the
one
appearing
on

67?
justice

and
they
do
review
in
some
length
the

court
what
they
refer
to
as
