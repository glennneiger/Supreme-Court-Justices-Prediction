well,
what
was
the
--
what
property
was
destroyed?
what
was
it
claimed
in
the
first
trial
that
was
destroyed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
it
is
possible
that
the
on
that
state
of
facts,
it
wasn't
the
painting
that
was
destroyed,
but
the
wall?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
--
within
that
the
--
what
was
stolen
was
painting
and
what
was
destroyed
is
the
wall?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
maybe
different
separate
acts?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
would
say
that
if
in
the
last
case,
on
the
robbery
case,
robbing
several
people
at
the
same
time
that
if
a
defendant
goes
up
to
one
person
and
lifts
his
wallet
out
of
his
pocket
and
goes
up
to
the
other
person
and
lifts
the
wallet
out
of
his
pocket
but
sticks
a
knife
in
him
at
the
same
time.
that's
a
state
may
not
try
the
person
for
murder
at
a
different
time
then
they
try
him
for
robbery.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
all
the
facts
there
are,
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
though,
that's
critical
to
your
case
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
to
say
that
or
should
--
if
we
say
the
wrong
on
double
--
on
the
so
called
two
sovereignty,
should
we
send
it
back
to
them
to
let
the
state
courts
apply
the
stanford
rule
to
this
case?
justice
