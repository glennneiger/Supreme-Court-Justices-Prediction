justice

stewart
i
understand
mr.
levinson
that
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
it's
the
same
defendant,
and
that
it
was
the
same
general
course
of
conduct.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
it
could
be
actually
the
same
action
that
could
be
disorderly
conduct
and
what
was
it,
a
malicious
destruction
of
property
or
destruction
of
government
property?

that
was
the
subject
to

and
then
the

larceny
generally,
doesn't
--
i
mean,
the
typical
congressional
larceny
case
doesn't
generally
embrace
what
we
think
of

disorderly
conduct?
justice

stewart
i
was
suggesting
by
my
question
that
it
was
that
it
might
be
possible
in
a
case,
for
example,
let's
assume
there
was
a
federal
statute
that
makes
it
an
offense
to
steal
government
property
and
another
statute
that
makes
it
an
offense
to
destroy
it,
federal
government
property.
i
suppose
it's
conceivable
that
a
person
might
steal
portrait
of
george
washington
from
the
white
house
and
then
a
couple
of
weeks
and
be
guilty
of
stealing
it
and
then
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
in
fear
that
he
is
going
to
be
discovered,
destroy
it
and
that
you
wouldn't
contend
those
were
necessary
one
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
--
was
this
question
of
the
making
available
to
the
defendant
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
an
err
that
was
brought
to
the
--
claimed
error
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
of
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
don't
believe
there's
any
mention
of
it
in
the
--
their
opinion,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
catch
all
in
the
last
next
last
paragraph,
but
we've
examined
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
your
argument
mr.
georgieff
is
that
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
seem
as
i
read
their
opinion
beginning
on
page
52a
of
the
appendix,
did
seem
to
rely
exclusively
upon
this
so-called
two
sovereignty's
rule
because
they
said
one
of
the
things,
this
information
was
based
on
the
same
acts
of
the
appellant
as
were
involved
in
the
violation
of
the
two
city
ordinances.
and
then
they
say,
assuming
but
not
holding
that
the
violations
of
the
municipal
ordinances
were
included
offenses
of
the
crime
of
grand
larceny,
that
the
appellant
nevertheless
has
not
twice
been
put
in
jeopardy
because
and
they
go
along
and
talk
about
your
florida's
so-called
two
sovereignty
rule
and
they
based
their
decision
as
i
read
this,
exclusively
upon
that
ground.
