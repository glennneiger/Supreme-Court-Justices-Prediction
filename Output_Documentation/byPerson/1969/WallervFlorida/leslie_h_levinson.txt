mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
which
affirmed
a
grand
larceny
conviction
of
the
petitioner
joseph
waller,
jr.
whom
i
represent.
this
court
ordered
the
case
to
be
argued
immediately
after
the
case
of
ashe
versus
swenson
which
we
have
just
heard.
two
issues
of
great
importance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
states
are
presented
by
this
case,
and
each
issue
in
our
view
independently
will
provide
grounds
for
reversing
the
judgment
below.
one
issue
is
a
double
jeopardy
issue,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
double
jeopardy
rule
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
where
there
are
successive
municipal
and
state
prosecutions
of
the
same
defendant
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct.
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
where
the
trial
judge
imposes
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
after
reading
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
he
refuses
to
make
available
either
to
the
defendant
or
to
the
appellate
court.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
material
dispute
and
never
have
been.
on
the
city
hall
of
saint
petersburg,
florida,
there
was
a
mural,
a
piece
of
canvas
attached
to
the
wall
by
glue
or
other
adhesive.
one
day
in
1966,
in
broad
daylight
and
during
business
hours
in
the
presence
of
a
substantial
crowd
which
include
the
police
officers
and
other
public
officials,
a
group
of
people
entered
the
city
hall,
tore
this
mural
off
the
wall,
brought
it
downstairs
into
the
street
and
starting
walking
through
the
streets
of
the
city
carrying
this
mural.
the
people
engaged
in
this
demonstration
alleged
that
the
mural
portrayed
the
negro
race
in
an
insulting
caricature,
and
the
people
were
expressing
their
displeasure
by
this
form
of
demonstration.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
petitioner,
joseph
waller,
jr.
was
a
member
of
the
group,
and
that
he
personally
participated
in
the
removal
of
the
mural
from
the
wall
and
in
carrying
it
through
the
streets
of
town.
a
very
short
while
after
and
as
part
of
the
same
continuous
happening
or
course
of
conduct,
the
police
confronted
waller
and
the
other
individuals,
recovered
the
mural
after
a
scuffle,
by
then
the
mural
was
in
a
slightly
damaged
condition.
perhaps
the
only
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
case
is
just
when
the
damage
occurred,
but
at
any
rate,
the
mural
was
recovered
by
the
police
and
waller
was
immediately
apprehended.
first,
waller
was
prosecuted
in
the
city
court
on
the
charge
that
he
had
violated
two
city
ordinances
during
that
course
of
conduct.
one
ordinance
concerns
destruction
of
city
property,
the
other
ordinance
disorderly
breech
of
the
peace.
he
plead
not
guilty
to
both
charges.
a
trial
was
held
in
the
municipal
court.
waller
was
found
guilty
on
both
charges
and
was
sentenced
to
the
maximum
of
90
days
on
each
charge.
the
sentence
is
to
be
served
consecutively.
while
he
was
serving,
his
total
of
180
days
on
the
city
ordinance
violations,
an
information
was
charged
alleging
the
felony
of
grand
larceny
and
this
grand
larceny
prosecution
is
what
turns
out
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
present
case.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
events
alleged
in
the
information
for
grand
larceny
concern
the
identical
defendant,
that
is
the
present
petitioner,
and
concern
the
identical
course
of
conduct,
the
same
day,
the
same
time,
the
same
mural
and
the
same
general
series
of
transactions.
and
this
fact
has
been
conceded
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
florida,
is
also
established
by
an
affidavit,
executed
by
the
petitioner
and
included
in
our
appendix,
page
15.
the
district
court
of
appeal
also
found
as
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
same
defendant
and
the
same
course
of
conduct
were
involved
both
in
the
city
and
in
the
information
for
grand
larceny
filed
by
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
destruction
of
city
property.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
in
both
trials
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
in
the
felony
trial
in
the
circuit
court,
that's
the
trial
for
grand
larceny,
the
point
was
raised
by
the
defendant,
that
larceny
generally
consists
under
florida
law
as
elsewhere
in
the
stealing
of
the
property.
however,
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
circuit
court
on
the
theory
amongst
others
that
larceny
in
florida
may
also
consists
of
the
destruction
of
the
property
rather
than
the
stealing
of
it,
or
even
creating
an
unreasonable
risk
of
destruction
under
florida
law,
sufficient
to
constitute
larceny.
the
record
contains
a
charge
to
the
jury
to
that
effect
which
we
do
not
include
in
the
appendix,
but
the
court
may
wish
to
refer
to
it.
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
is
briefed
in
the
appendix
actually
mentions
the
matter
which
was
an
issue
on
appeal.
and
if
i
am
refer
to
the
court,
the
court
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
back
on
page
55
of
our
appendix,
the
district
court
of
appeal
coped
with
the
problem,
can
there
be
a
larceny
by
destruction
under
florida
law
and
they
say
yes,
there
can
be,
and
there
was.
to
some
extent,
this
represents
a
stretching
of
pre-existing
florida
law
on
grand
larceny.
it
illustrates
perhaps
that
the
state
was
straining
pretty
far
in
order
to
try
to
pin
a
grand
larceny
label
upon
what
actually
happened.
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
affirm
the
trial
court
upon
the
theory
amongst
others
that
larceny
can
exist
on
the
basis
of
destruction
of
the
property
rather
than
clipping
it
and
concealing
it
as
we
would
normally
think
of
larceny.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
certainly
not
mr.
justice.
they
would
take
place
under
your
circumstances
at
different
times
for
one
thing,
and
they
would
offend
different
policies
of
the
state.
what
i
suggest
here
is
that
the
--
a
single
incident
happened
continuously
within
the
very
few
minutes
was
the
sole
evidence
introduced
both
in
the
city
court
and
in
the
circuit
court,
and
the
state
strayed
rather
far
in
order
to
label
it
grand
larceny
presumably
wanting
to,
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
“throw
the
book”
at
this
defendant.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
mr.
justice,
there's
no
record
of
the
trial
in
the
city
court
and
i
was
not
there
personally.
i
have
to
rely
on
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner
who
was
present
and
his
affidavit
which
is
not
been
controverted,
states
that
the
same
facts
were
introduced
an
evidence
in
the
city
court
as
in
the
felony
court.
that
is
the
fact
the
he
entered
the
city
hall,
tore
the
mural
off
the
wall,
carried
it
out
on
the
streets
and
it
was
recovered
in
a
damaged
condition.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
indeed,
it
is
possible.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
possible
and
we
concede
that
it
is
possible
that
a
single
course
of
conduct
may
indeed
offend
a
number
of
statutes
at
the
same
time.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
maybe.
we
believe
that
the
--
our
rule
of
compulsory
joinder
would
require
that
as
many
complaints
of
the
state
may
have
against
the
defendant
by
reason
of
this
course
of
conduct,
they
should
join
them
into
one
trial,
try
it
once
on
the
multiple
count
indictment
if
this
proper,
but
not
to
keep
on
trying
him
a
number
of
different
times
so
that
to
use
mr.
clifford's
term,
he
shall
not
have
to
run
the
gauntlets
of
the
criminal
process.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
think
that
if
all
the
facts
are
known
to
the
state
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
believe
that
the
state
under
the
arguments
which
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief
and
which
i
wish
to
elaborate
on
a
little
while,
the
state
should
join
together
all
the
charges
in
a
single
trial
which
may
contain
numerous
counts
alleging
the
various
criminal
statutes
which
has
been
violated.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
certainly
important.
we
have
an
alternative
theory,
that
is
for
theory
of
lesser
included
offense.
we
believe
that
either
the
compulsory
joinder
or
the
lesser
included
offense
theory
will
be
sufficient
to
require
reversal
of
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
this
case.
if
i
may
resume,
if
it
please
the
court,
after
the
felony
information
was
filed
alleging
the
crime
of
grand
larceny,
three
more
informations
were
filed
by
the
county
prosecutor
alleging
the
three
misdemeanors
of
one;
unlawful
assembly;
two,
malicious
destruction
of
public
property;
and
three,
resisting
arrest
without
violence.
counsel
was
able
to
persuade
the
county
prosecutor
that
double
jeopardy
had
indeed
been
reached
by
the
filing
of
these
three
misdemeanor
charges
and
so
the
county
prosecutor
withdrew
the
three
misdemeanors
and
they
never
came
on
for
trial.
but
the
state's
attorney
persisted
in
bringing
these
grand
larceny
charges
at
trial
to
trial
and
ultimately,
the
trial
resulted
in
a
judgment
in
the
verdict
against
the
defendant.
before
the
matter
came
on
for
trial,
appropriate
motions
to
quash
were
filed
as
the
appropriate
florida
means
of
challenging
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
a
case,
and
when
they
were
denied,
a
suggestion
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
in
the
florida
supreme
court
as
an
additional
means
of
attention
--
to
get
the
florida
courts
to
decide
that
double
jeopardy
had
been
violated.
these
attempts
were
unsuccessful.
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
the
same
evidence
was
introduced
at
this
trial
according
to
the
petitioner's
affidavit
as
had
been
introduced
at
the
city
court,
the
same
mural
was
identified
by
the
same
witnesses
as
the
record
shows
and
eventually,
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
was
given
a
sentence
of
from
six
months
to
five
years
which
is
the
statutory
maximum
under
florida
law
for
double
jeopardy.
i
might
briefly
mention
the
facts
or
the
proceedings
as
they
arose
concerning
the
pre-sentence
report
and
then
i
would
like
to
return
to
a
discussion
of
the
double
jeopardy
issue.
after
verdict
and
before
sentencing,
petitioner
moved
the
court
for
discovery
of
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
had
been
prepared
by
a
probation
officer.
now,
the
court
denied
this
motion.
the
call
to
refer
to
the
pre-sentence
report.
the
court
pronounced
the
sentence.
after
sentence
again,
petitioner
renewed
his
request
to
see
report
asserting
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
any
errors
or
to
parry
any
unfavorable
contents
of
the
report.
this
request
was
denied.
when
the
case
was
being
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal,
petitioner
asked
the
clerk
of
the
trail
court
to
include
the
pre-sentence
report
in
the
record,
this
was
denied.
appropriate
motions
were
filed
in
both
courts
to
try
to
get
the
pre-sentence
report
in
the
record.
all
motions
were
denied
and
to
this
very
day,
this
very
court
has
no
access
to
the
pre-sentence
report
which
is
still
secreted
in
the
desk
of
a
trial
judge
in
saint
petersburg,
florida.
the
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
for
the
second
district
which
affirmed
that
opinion
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
and
if
i
may
return
now
to
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
stated
and
i
quote
from
page
53
of
the
appendix.
“assuming
but
not
holding,
that
violations
of
the
municipal
ordinances
were
included
offenses
of
the
crime
of
grand
larceny,
nevertheless
there
is
no
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule
because
said
the
florida
court
of
appeal,
even
if
a
person
has
been
tried
in
a
municipal
court
for
the
identical
offense
with
which
he
is
charged
in
a
state
court,
this
would
not
be
a
bar
for
the
prosecution
of
such
person
in
the
proper
state
court.
this
has
been
the
law
of
a
state
since
1894.”
and
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals
cited
the
case
of
theisen
versus
mcdavid
which
as
it
happens
mentioned
that
proposition
by
way
of
dictum,
but
since
then
the
proposition
has
indeed
been
absorbed
as
a
principle
of
florida
law,
that
is
that
the
same
--
the
identical
offense
could
be
prosecuted
both
by
the
municipality
and
the
state
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
rule
of
the
state
of
florida.
first
by
way
of
argument
upon
the
double
jeopardy
matter,
the
case
of
benton
versus
maryland
decided
by
this
court
on
the
last
day
of
last
term
clearly
holds
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
makes
the
double
jeopardy
rule
applicable
to
the
states.
we
argued
that
for
purposes
of
applying
the
benton
rule,
a
prior
prosecution
by
a
municipality
within
the
state
must
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
a
prior
prosecution
by
the
state
itself.
the
reason
being
that
the
municipality
is
a
part
of
the
state,
a
creature
of
the
state
and
is
not
an
independent
sovereign.
we
recognize
that
there
have
been
attempts
to
employ
a
dual
sovereignty
theory.
the
attempts
following
traditional
florida
law
in
the
theisen
case
have
urged
that
the
municipality
is
a
separate
sovereign
from
the
state
and
that
each
has
a
special
interest
which
it
may
vindicate.
and
many
of
the
cases
in
florida
and
other
states
used
as
analogy,
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
federal
governments.
10
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
the
two
cases
of
bartkus
and
abbate,
this
court
held
that
successive
prosecutions
by
state
and
federal
governments
are
permitted
within
the
framework
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule.
we
do
not
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
for
bartkus
and
abbate
decisions
in
order
to
dispose
of
present
case.
we
think
the
relationship
between
city
and
state
is
not
the
same
as
the
relationship
between
state
and
federal
government.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
case
i
believe
should
be
reversed.
i
think
the
second
trial
for
grand
larceny
in
the
circuit
court
should
never
been
held.
the
second
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
now,
the
florida
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
they
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
the
leading
case
in
florida
on
double
jeopardy,
obviously
has
to
be
a
case
evolving
two
prosecutions
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
because
no
other
possibility
crossed
the
threshold
and
in
this
connection,
the
florida
case
of
stanford
versus
faith
cited
in
the
brief
on
pages
30
and
31,
decided
in
1918,
i
believe
still
be
definitive
of
state
of
florida
law.
it
was
reiterated
by
the
wilcocks's
case
in
1966.
and
if
may
read
a
quotation
from
stanford
on
page
30,
florida
says
“if
the
first
information
as
such
that
the
accused
have
been
convicted
under
it
on
proof
of
the
facts
by
which
the
second
information
is
sought
to
be
sustained
then
the
jeopardy
which
attached
on
the
first
must
considered
a
protection
against
the
trial
on
the
second.”
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
believe
that
the
case
is
clear
enough
that
this
court
can
dispose
of
it
completely.
obviously,
this
court
would
first,
have
to
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
dual
sovereignty
rule
should
apply
and
i
think
clearly
as
this
court
should
hold
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes.
well
first,
if
this
court
agrees
that
a
municipality
is
a
pose
of
the
same
sovereignty
as
the
state,
then
we
reach
the
stanford
rule.
i
believe
the
stanford
rule
is
clear
enough.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
since
florida
law
failed
to
apply
it
because
they
never
reached
it,
i
believe
that
the
interest
of
justice
so
as
to
the
disposal
of
this
litigation
this
court
is
probably
able
and
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
apply
the
stanford
rule
under
its
general
authority
to
dispose
of
the
litigation
as
interest
of
justice
may
require.
now,
this
man
is
been
in
jail
for
16
months
and
for
about
another
18
months,
he
is
been
out
on
bond
in
the
shadow
of
imprisonment.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
his
first
sentence
was
two
consecutive
90-day
sentences.
so,
that
was
six
months.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
question
which
is
still
unfortunately
not
clear
because
while
he
was
serving
the
6-month
city
sentence,
he
was
also
being
held
for
trial
in
the
state
court.
and
when
the
state
judge
sentenced
him
to
six
months
to
five
years
the
state
court
judge
said
the
allowing
credit
for
the
time
he
is
being
confined.
and
we
are
not
yet
clear
whether
that
credit
refers
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
served
a
city
sentence
or
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
held
pending
trial
of
the
state
case?
we
have
approached
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
no
sir.
he
was
awaiting
trial
and
we
have
approached
the
city
judge
in
an
attempt
to
determine
whether
the
city
believes
that
the
man
has
served
sentence
or
not
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
judge
will
--
would
agree
that
he
has
served
his
sentence,
but
there
is
at
least
a
possibility.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well,
he
was
confined
to
the
county
jail
and
it's
not
unusual
for
city
prisoners
to
be
switched
around,
even
to
county
jail
or
even
to
state
penitentiary
while
they're
awaiting
trial
on
state
offenses.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
and
my
understanding
is
that
as
a
matter
of
florida
law,
it's
somewhat
unclear
whether
he
has
yet
served
the
city
sentence
or
not.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice,
there
was
problem
about
the
bond
also.
we
have
to
appeal
for
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
and
also
to
the
florida
supreme
court
before
we
go
out
on
bond.
he
turned
out
to
be
a
defendant
who
was
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
he
turned
that
to
be
a
defendant
who
was
not
given
the
maximum
leniency
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
$2,500.00.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
he
did
make
it.
originally,
a
higher
bond
was
set.
originally,
the
court
refused
any
bond,
then
a
high
bond
was
set
and
it
took
the
pedal
court
proceedings.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
sir,
and
as
a
reported
opinion
in
the
southern
reporter
in
which
a
florida
appellate
court
reversed
the
trial
judge
on
that
matter
which
suggests
amongst
other
things
that
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
may
have
had
prejudicial
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
trial
judge
which
perhaps
will
be
discussed
when
i
reach
the
other
point
of
the
argument.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
he
took
a
mural
from
the
wall
of
the
city
hall.
a
painting
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
a
canvas
painting.
the
big
thing,
a
group
of
negro
musicians.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
a
group
of
negro
musicians
were
depicted
on
this
painting
and
he
and
other
members
of
his
group
allege
that
this
was
an
insulting
caricature
of
their
race.
now,
he
was
punished
for
his
conduct
by
180
days
in
the
city
jail.
we
are
not
appealing
that.
we
are
protesting
that
he
should
not
have
been
tried
twice
on
the
basis
of
this
single
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
for
same
transaction,
the
same
course
of
conduct
or
in
current
language
the
same
happening,
if
i
may
use
the
words.
now,
i
indicated
before
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
relationship
between
municipality
and
state
is
not
analogous
to
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
i
believe
the
more
appropriate
analogy
is
that
between
a
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
government
and
this
court
held
as
long
as
1907
in
the
grafton
case
that
former
prosecution
by
a
territory
clearly
bars
a
subsequent
prosecution
by
a
tribunal
of
the
united
states.
and
i
believe
that
grafton
case
is
adequate
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
two
arms
of
the
same
sovereign
should
not
be
permitted
separately
to
try
a
defendant.
if
we
may
assume
that
municipality
is
an
arm
of
a
sovereign
state,
i
believe
we
have
two
alternative
approaches
either
of
which
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
double
jeopardy
rule
bars
the
state
prosecution.
one
theory
is
a
theory
of
compulsory
joinder
and
another
theory
is
a
theory
of
the
lesser
include
of
offense
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
that
the
white
light
is
flashing,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remaining
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
word
about
this
question
of
larceny
by
destruction.
in
order
to
establish
the
crime
of
larceny,
the
state
has
to
prove
amongst
other
things
felonious
intent,
and
as
i
understand
florida
law,
felonious
intent
can
be
proved
either
by
an
act
of
taking
away
to
conceal
the
property
or
in
florida,
felonious
intent
can
be
established
either
by
the
destruction
or
by
exposing
the
property
to
an
unreasonable
risk
of
destruction.
since
the
taking
took
place
in
broad
daylight
in
the
presence
of
public
officials
and
police
officers,
we
contend
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
which
would
justify
a
finding
of
felonious
intent
based
on
an
attempt
to
conceal,
that
was
impossible
that
in
the
circumstances.
and
so,
since
jury
found
him
guilty,
the
only
possible
basis
of
those
finding
of
guilt
must
have
been
on
the
other
branch
of
felonious
intent,
that
is
to
say
on
the
destruction
or
creating
the
reasonable
risk
of
destruction
of
the
property.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
carrying
it
off
can
only
be
the
ingredients
of
larceny
if
it
is
carried
off
with
felonious
intent
and
the
presence
of
police
officers
negated
the
possibility
of
the
requisite
felonious
intent
on
the
evidence
presented
by
the
state.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well,
the
circumstances
of
a
bank
robbery
make
it
obvious
that
the
robbers
intend
if
they
can
to
get
away
with
the
haul.
the
circumstances
of
this
case
make
it
obvious
that
the
petitioner
had
no
intention
of
keeping
the
mural.
he
wants
it
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
they
have
an
intention
to
take
it
away
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
a
demonstration.
they
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
they
walked
the
few
city
blocks
with
it
in
the
presence
of
a
large
crowd
of
people
including
the
police
officers.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
the
police
recovered.
this
is
i
believe,
the
city
authorities
still
have
it
in
custody,
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
no
sir.
they're
holding
it
dependently
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
sir,
they
have.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
three
years,
but
the
mural
was
in
the
custody
of
the
city
even
or
not
on
the
wall
of
the
city
hall.
now,
we
believe
it
is
possible
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
issue
of
the
identity
of
the
proofs
without
the
necessity
of
remanding
it
to
the
florida
court.
obviously,
if
this
court
find
itself
unable
to
resolve
the
issue
it
would
be
a
proper
one
to
send
back
to
florida.
now,
i
would
take
the
liberty
of
correcting
the
attorney
general
in
his
comment
that
the
state
is
unable
to
prosecute
for
the
destruction
of
city
property.
our
appendix
on
pages
6
and
12
presents
pertinent
state
statutes
which
do
make
it
a
misdemeanor.
in
fact,
one
of
the
three
misdemeanors
which
was
filed
and
then
dropped,
specifically
referred
to
the
destruction
or
damaging
the
city
property,
and
this
is
set
forth
on
pages
6
and
12
of
the
appendix.
in
fact,
the
state
has
an
ample
arsenal
of
statutes
that
whatever
conduct
violates
a
city
ordinance
can
pretty
well
be
assured
that
having
a
counterpart
in
the
state
statutes,
the
state
assumed
a
self
resourceful.
indeed,
in
finding
statutes,
there
are
the
points
of
violating
the
constitution
and
having
the
vagrancy
law
reversed
by
a
federal
court
recently.
and
so,
i
believe
that
if
we
require
the
state
to
have
a
single
trial
of
all
their
complaints
against
an
individual
the
prosecutor
can
find
in
their
discretion
adequate
statutory
basis
for
bringing
whatever
trial
will
appropriate.
mr.
georgieff
states
that
we
will
be
quite
prepared
to
have
our
petitioner
tried
and
sentenced
for
all
of
his
offenses
in
one
trial.
this
is
not
quite
so.
we
certainly
want
only
one
trial.
in
that
trial,
the
state
could
bring
whatever
complaints
it
wanted
to.
we
might
then
argue
that
that
they
would
be
unnecessarily
overlapping
between
the
complaints
under
rule
of
(inaudible)
case
which
holds
that
a
legislation
will
be
presumed
to
intend
multiple
punishments
arising
at
a
single
act
unless
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
states
that
multiple
punishments
are
called
for.
just
to
summarize
the
double
jeopardy
argument,
and
i
can
hope
i
can
spent
it
at
one
minute
on
the
important
issue
of
pre-sentence
reports.
we
believe
there
are
two
basis,
either
one
of
which
will
support
our
argument
on
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
one
is
compulsory
joinder.
we
assert
as
a
rule
of
constitutional
dimensions
that
the
state
should
have
only
one
trial
of
a
defendant
on
the
basis
of
a
single
act
or
course
of
conduct.
there
maybe
exceptions
to
this
rule.
for
example
if
the
victim
of
an
assault
dies
after
trial,
we
could
say
will
this
would
give
rise
to
an
exception
to
the
compulsory
joinder
rule
or
if
the
first
trial
was
a
sham.
but
in
all
that
you
clarify
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
and
also
included
within
it
the
common
law
tradition.
we
submit
that
compulsory
joinder
should
be
the
presumption
and
to
then
the
exception
needs
to
be
justified
by
the
state.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
which
affirmed
a
grand
larceny
conviction
of
the
petitioner
joseph
waller,
jr.
whom
i
represent.
this
court
ordered
the
case
to
be
argued
immediately
after
the
case
of
ashe
versus
swenson
which
we
have
just
heard.
two
issues
of
great
importance
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
states
are
presented
by
this
case,
and
each
issue
in
our
view
independently
will
provide
grounds
for
reversing
the
judgment
below.
one
issue
is
a
double
jeopardy
issue,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
double
jeopardy
rule
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
where
there
are
successive
municipal
and
state
prosecutions
of
the
same
defendant
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct.
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
where
the
trial
judge
imposes
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
after
reading
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
he
refuses
to
make
available
either
to
the
defendant
or
to
the
appellate
court.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
material
dispute
and
never
have
been.
on
the
city
hall
of
saint
petersburg,
florida,
there
was
a
mural,
a
piece
of
canvas
attached
to
the
wall
by
glue
or
other
adhesive.
one
day
in
1966,
in
broad
daylight
and
during
business
hours
in
the
presence
of
a
substantial
crowd
which
include
the
police
officers
and
other
public
officials,
a
group
of
people
entered
the
city
hall,
tore
this
mural
off
the
wall,
brought
it
downstairs
into
the
street
and
starting
walking
through
the
streets
of
the
city
carrying
this
mural.
the
people
engaged
in
this
demonstration
alleged
that
the
mural
portrayed
the
negro
race
in
an
insulting
caricature,
and
the
people
were
expressing
their
displeasure
by
this
form
of
demonstration.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
petitioner,
joseph
waller,
jr.
was
a
member
of
the
group,
and
that
he
personally
participated
in
the
removal
of
the
mural
from
the
wall
and
in
carrying
it
through
the
streets
of
town.
a
very
short
while
after
and
as
part
of
the
same
continuous
happening
or
course
of
conduct,
the
police
confronted
waller
and
the
other
individuals,
recovered
the
mural
after
a
scuffle,
by
then
the
mural
was
in
a
slightly
damaged
condition.
perhaps
the
only
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
case
is
just
when
the
damage
occurred,
but
at
any
rate,
the
mural
was
recovered
by
the
police
and
waller
was
immediately
apprehended.
first,
waller
was
prosecuted
in
the
city
court
on
the
charge
that
he
had
violated
two
city
ordinances
during
that
course
of
conduct.
one
ordinance
concerns
destruction
of
city
property,
the
other
ordinance
disorderly
breech
of
the
peace.
he
plead
not
guilty
to
both
charges.
a
trial
was
held
in
the
municipal
court.
waller
was
found
guilty
on
both
charges
and
was
sentenced
to
the
maximum
of
90
days
on
each
charge.
the
sentence
is
to
be
served
consecutively.
while
he
was
serving,
his
total
of
180
days
on
the
city
ordinance
violations,
an
information
was
charged
alleging
the
felony
of
grand
larceny
and
this
grand
larceny
prosecution
is
what
turns
out
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
the
present
case.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
events
alleged
in
the
information
for
grand
larceny
concern
the
identical
defendant,
that
is
the
present
petitioner,
and
concern
the
identical
course
of
conduct,
the
same
day,
the
same
time,
the
same
mural
and
the
same
general
series
of
transactions.
and
this
fact
has
been
conceded
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
florida,
is
also
established
by
an
affidavit,
executed
by
the
petitioner
and
included
in
our
appendix,
page
15.
the
district
court
of
appeal
also
found
as
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
same
defendant
and
the
same
course
of
conduct
were
involved
both
in
the
city
and
in
the
information
for
grand
larceny
filed
by
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
destruction
of
city
property.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
in
both
trials
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
in
the
felony
trial
in
the
circuit
court,
that's
the
trial
for
grand
larceny,
the
point
was
raised
by
the
defendant,
that
larceny
generally
consists
under
florida
law
as
elsewhere
in
the
stealing
of
the
property.
however,
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
circuit
court
on
the
theory
amongst
others
that
larceny
in
florida
may
also
consists
of
the
destruction
of
the
property
rather
than
the
stealing
of
it,
or
even
creating
an
unreasonable
risk
of
destruction
under
florida
law,
sufficient
to
constitute
larceny.
the
record
contains
a
charge
to
the
jury
to
that
effect
which
we
do
not
include
in
the
appendix,
but
the
court
may
wish
to
refer
to
it.
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
is
briefed
in
the
appendix
actually
mentions
the
matter
which
was
an
issue
on
appeal.
and
if
i
am
refer
to
the
court,
the
court
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
back
on
page
55
of
our
appendix,
the
district
court
of
appeal
coped
with
the
problem,
can
there
be
a
larceny
by
destruction
under
florida
law
and
they
say
yes,
there
can
be,
and
there
was.
to
some
extent,
this
represents
a
stretching
of
pre-existing
florida
law
on
grand
larceny.
it
illustrates
perhaps
that
the
state
was
straining
pretty
far
in
order
to
try
to
pin
a
grand
larceny
label
upon
what
actually
happened.
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
affirm
the
trial
court
upon
the
theory
amongst
others
that
larceny
can
exist
on
the
basis
of
destruction
of
the
property
rather
than
clipping
it
and
concealing
it
as
we
would
normally
think
of
larceny.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
certainly
not
mr.
justice.
they
would
take
place
under
your
circumstances
at
different
times
for
one
thing,
and
they
would
offend
different
policies
of
the
state.
what
i
suggest
here
is
that
the
--
a
single
incident
happened
continuously
within
the
very
few
minutes
was
the
sole
evidence
introduced
both
in
the
city
court
and
in
the
circuit
court,
and
the
state
strayed
rather
far
in
order
to
label
it
grand
larceny
presumably
wanting
to,
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
“throw
the
book”
at
this
defendant.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
mr.
justice,
there's
no
record
of
the
trial
in
the
city
court
and
i
was
not
there
personally.
i
have
to
rely
on
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner
who
was
present
and
his
affidavit
which
is
not
been
controverted,
states
that
the
same
facts
were
introduced
an
evidence
in
the
city
court
as
in
the
felony
court.
that
is
the
fact
the
he
entered
the
city
hall,
tore
the
mural
off
the
wall,
carried
it
out
on
the
streets
and
it
was
recovered
in
a
damaged
condition.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
indeed,
it
is
possible.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
possible
and
we
concede
that
it
is
possible
that
a
single
course
of
conduct
may
indeed
offend
a
number
of
statutes
at
the
same
time.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
maybe.
we
believe
that
the
--
our
rule
of
compulsory
joinder
would
require
that
as
many
complaints
of
the
state
may
have
against
the
defendant
by
reason
of
this
course
of
conduct,
they
should
join
them
into
one
trial,
try
it
once
on
the
multiple
count
indictment
if
this
proper,
but
not
to
keep
on
trying
him
a
number
of
different
times
so
that
to
use
mr.
clifford's
term,
he
shall
not
have
to
run
the
gauntlets
of
the
criminal
process.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
think
that
if
all
the
facts
are
known
to
the
state
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
believe
that
the
state
under
the
arguments
which
we
have
submitted
in
our
brief
and
which
i
wish
to
elaborate
on
a
little
while,
the
state
should
join
together
all
the
charges
in
a
single
trial
which
may
contain
numerous
counts
alleging
the
various
criminal
statutes
which
has
been
violated.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
certainly
important.
we
have
an
alternative
theory,
that
is
for
theory
of
lesser
included
offense.
we
believe
that
either
the
compulsory
joinder
or
the
lesser
included
offense
theory
will
be
sufficient
to
require
reversal
of
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
this
case.
if
i
may
resume,
if
it
please
the
court,
after
the
felony
information
was
filed
alleging
the
crime
of
grand
larceny,
three
more
informations
were
filed
by
the
county
prosecutor
alleging
the
three
misdemeanors
of
one;
unlawful
assembly;
two,
malicious
destruction
of
public
property;
and
three,
resisting
arrest
without
violence.
counsel
was
able
to
persuade
the
county
prosecutor
that
double
jeopardy
had
indeed
been
reached
by
the
filing
of
these
three
misdemeanor
charges
and
so
the
county
prosecutor
withdrew
the
three
misdemeanors
and
they
never
came
on
for
trial.
but
the
state's
attorney
persisted
in
bringing
these
grand
larceny
charges
at
trial
to
trial
and
ultimately,
the
trial
resulted
in
a
judgment
in
the
verdict
against
the
defendant.
before
the
matter
came
on
for
trial,
appropriate
motions
to
quash
were
filed
as
the
appropriate
florida
means
of
challenging
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
a
case,
and
when
they
were
denied,
a
suggestion
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
in
the
florida
supreme
court
as
an
additional
means
of
attention
--
to
get
the
florida
courts
to
decide
that
double
jeopardy
had
been
violated.
these
attempts
were
unsuccessful.
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
the
same
evidence
was
introduced
at
this
trial
according
to
the
petitioner's
affidavit
as
had
been
introduced
at
the
city
court,
the
same
mural
was
identified
by
the
same
witnesses
as
the
record
shows
and
eventually,
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
was
given
a
sentence
of
from
six
months
to
five
years
which
is
the
statutory
maximum
under
florida
law
for
double
jeopardy.
i
might
briefly
mention
the
facts
or
the
proceedings
as
they
arose
concerning
the
pre-sentence
report
and
then
i
would
like
to
return
to
a
discussion
of
the
double
jeopardy
issue.
after
verdict
and
before
sentencing,
petitioner
moved
the
court
for
discovery
of
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
had
been
prepared
by
a
probation
officer.
now,
the
court
denied
this
motion.
the
call
to
refer
to
the
pre-sentence
report.
the
court
pronounced
the
sentence.
after
sentence
again,
petitioner
renewed
his
request
to
see
report
asserting
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
any
errors
or
to
parry
any
unfavorable
contents
of
the
report.
this
request
was
denied.
when
the
case
was
being
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal,
petitioner
asked
the
clerk
of
the
trail
court
to
include
the
pre-sentence
report
in
the
record,
this
was
denied.
appropriate
motions
were
filed
in
both
courts
to
try
to
get
the
pre-sentence
report
in
the
record.
all
motions
were
denied
and
to
this
very
day,
this
very
court
has
no
access
to
the
pre-sentence
report
which
is
still
secreted
in
the
desk
of
a
trial
judge
in
saint
petersburg,
florida.
the
conviction
was
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
for
the
second
district
which
affirmed
that
opinion
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
and
if
i
may
return
now
to
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
stated
and
i
quote
from
page
53
of
the
appendix.
“assuming
but
not
holding,
that
violations
of
the
municipal
ordinances
were
included
offenses
of
the
crime
of
grand
larceny,
nevertheless
there
is
no
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule
because
said
the
florida
court
of
appeal,
even
if
a
person
has
been
tried
in
a
municipal
court
for
the
identical
offense
with
which
he
is
charged
in
a
state
court,
this
would
not
be
a
bar
for
the
prosecution
of
such
person
in
the
proper
state
court.
this
has
been
the
law
of
a
state
since
1894.”
and
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals
cited
the
case
of
theisen
versus
mcdavid
which
as
it
happens
mentioned
that
proposition
by
way
of
dictum,
but
since
then
the
proposition
has
indeed
been
absorbed
as
a
principle
of
florida
law,
that
is
that
the
same
--
the
identical
offense
could
be
prosecuted
both
by
the
municipality
and
the
state
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
rule
of
the
state
of
florida.
first
by
way
of
argument
upon
the
double
jeopardy
matter,
the
case
of
benton
versus
maryland
decided
by
this
court
on
the
last
day
of
last
term
clearly
holds
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
makes
the
double
jeopardy
rule
applicable
to
the
states.
we
argued
that
for
purposes
of
applying
the
benton
rule,
a
prior
prosecution
by
a
municipality
within
the
state
must
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
a
prior
prosecution
by
the
state
itself.
the
reason
being
that
the
municipality
is
a
part
of
the
state,
a
creature
of
the
state
and
is
not
an
independent
sovereign.
we
recognize
that
there
have
been
attempts
to
employ
a
dual
sovereignty
theory.
the
attempts
following
traditional
florida
law
in
the
theisen
case
have
urged
that
the
municipality
is
a
separate
sovereign
from
the
state
and
that
each
has
a
special
interest
which
it
may
vindicate.
and
many
of
the
cases
in
florida
and
other
states
used
as
analogy,
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
federal
governments.
10
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
the
two
cases
of
bartkus
and
abbate,
this
court
held
that
successive
prosecutions
by
state
and
federal
governments
are
permitted
within
the
framework
of
the
double
jeopardy
rule.
we
do
not
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
for
bartkus
and
abbate
decisions
in
order
to
dispose
of
present
case.
we
think
the
relationship
between
city
and
state
is
not
the
same
as
the
relationship
between
state
and
federal
government.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
case
i
believe
should
be
reversed.
i
think
the
second
trial
for
grand
larceny
in
the
circuit
court
should
never
been
held.
the
second
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
now,
the
florida
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
they
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice,
the
leading
case
in
florida
on
double
jeopardy,
obviously
has
to
be
a
case
evolving
two
prosecutions
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
because
no
other
possibility
crossed
the
threshold
and
in
this
connection,
the
florida
case
of
stanford
versus
faith
cited
in
the
brief
on
pages
30
and
31,
decided
in
1918,
i
believe
still
be
definitive
of
state
of
florida
law.
it
was
reiterated
by
the
wilcocks's
case
in
1966.
and
if
may
read
a
quotation
from
stanford
on
page
30,
florida
says
“if
the
first
information
as
such
that
the
accused
have
been
convicted
under
it
on
proof
of
the
facts
by
which
the
second
information
is
sought
to
be
sustained
then
the
jeopardy
which
attached
on
the
first
must
considered
a
protection
against
the
trial
on
the
second.”
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
i
believe
that
the
case
is
clear
enough
that
this
court
can
dispose
of
it
completely.
obviously,
this
court
would
first,
have
to
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
dual
sovereignty
rule
should
apply
and
i
think
clearly
as
this
court
should
hold
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes.
well
first,
if
this
court
agrees
that
a
municipality
is
a
pose
of
the
same
sovereignty
as
the
state,
then
we
reach
the
stanford
rule.
i
believe
the
stanford
rule
is
clear
enough.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
since
florida
law
failed
to
apply
it
because
they
never
reached
it,
i
believe
that
the
interest
of
justice
so
as
to
the
disposal
of
this
litigation
this
court
is
probably
able
and
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
apply
the
stanford
rule
under
its
general
authority
to
dispose
of
the
litigation
as
interest
of
justice
may
require.
now,
this
man
is
been
in
jail
for
16
months
and
for
about
another
18
months,
he
is
been
out
on
bond
in
the
shadow
of
imprisonment.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
his
first
sentence
was
two
consecutive
90-day
sentences.
so,
that
was
six
months.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
question
which
is
still
unfortunately
not
clear
because
while
he
was
serving
the
6-month
city
sentence,
he
was
also
being
held
for
trial
in
the
state
court.
and
when
the
state
judge
sentenced
him
to
six
months
to
five
years
the
state
court
judge
said
the
allowing
credit
for
the
time
he
is
being
confined.
and
we
are
not
yet
clear
whether
that
credit
refers
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
served
a
city
sentence
or
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
held
pending
trial
of
the
state
case?
we
have
approached
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
no
sir.
he
was
awaiting
trial
and
we
have
approached
the
city
judge
in
an
attempt
to
determine
whether
the
city
believes
that
the
man
has
served
sentence
or
not
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
judge
will
--
would
agree
that
he
has
served
his
sentence,
but
there
is
at
least
a
possibility.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well,
he
was
confined
to
the
county
jail
and
it's
not
unusual
for
city
prisoners
to
be
switched
around,
even
to
county
jail
or
even
to
state
penitentiary
while
they're
awaiting
trial
on
state
offenses.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
and
my
understanding
is
that
as
a
matter
of
florida
law,
it's
somewhat
unclear
whether
he
has
yet
served
the
city
sentence
or
not.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice,
there
was
problem
about
the
bond
also.
we
have
to
appeal
for
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
and
also
to
the
florida
supreme
court
before
we
go
out
on
bond.
he
turned
out
to
be
a
defendant
who
was
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
he
turned
that
to
be
a
defendant
who
was
not
given
the
maximum
leniency
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
$2,500.00.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
he
did
make
it.
originally,
a
higher
bond
was
set.
originally,
the
court
refused
any
bond,
then
a
high
bond
was
set
and
it
took
the
pedal
court
proceedings.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
sir,
and
as
a
reported
opinion
in
the
southern
reporter
in
which
a
florida
appellate
court
reversed
the
trial
judge
on
that
matter
which
suggests
amongst
other
things
that
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
may
have
had
prejudicial
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
trial
judge
which
perhaps
will
be
discussed
when
i
reach
the
other
point
of
the
argument.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
he
took
a
mural
from
the
wall
of
the
city
hall.
a
painting
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
a
canvas
painting.
the
big
thing,
a
group
of
negro
musicians.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
a
group
of
negro
musicians
were
depicted
on
this
painting
and
he
and
other
members
of
his
group
allege
that
this
was
an
insulting
caricature
of
their
race.
now,
he
was
punished
for
his
conduct
by
180
days
in
the
city
jail.
we
are
not
appealing
that.
we
are
protesting
that
he
should
not
have
been
tried
twice
on
the
basis
of
this
single
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
for
same
transaction,
the
same
course
of
conduct
or
in
current
language
the
same
happening,
if
i
may
use
the
words.
now,
i
indicated
before
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
relationship
between
municipality
and
state
is
not
analogous
to
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
i
believe
the
more
appropriate
analogy
is
that
between
a
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
government
and
this
court
held
as
long
as
1907
in
the
grafton
case
that
former
prosecution
by
a
territory
clearly
bars
a
subsequent
prosecution
by
a
tribunal
of
the
united
states.
and
i
believe
that
grafton
case
is
adequate
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
two
arms
of
the
same
sovereign
should
not
be
permitted
separately
to
try
a
defendant.
if
we
may
assume
that
municipality
is
an
arm
of
a
sovereign
state,
i
believe
we
have
two
alternative
approaches
either
of
which
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
double
jeopardy
rule
bars
the
state
prosecution.
one
theory
is
a
theory
of
compulsory
joinder
and
another
theory
is
a
theory
of
the
lesser
include
of
offense
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
that
the
white
light
is
flashing,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remaining
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
word
about
this
question
of
larceny
by
destruction.
in
order
to
establish
the
crime
of
larceny,
the
state
has
to
prove
amongst
other
things
felonious
intent,
and
as
i
understand
florida
law,
felonious
intent
can
be
proved
either
by
an
act
of
taking
away
to
conceal
the
property
or
in
florida,
felonious
intent
can
be
established
either
by
the
destruction
or
by
exposing
the
property
to
an
unreasonable
risk
of
destruction.
since
the
taking
took
place
in
broad
daylight
in
the
presence
of
public
officials
and
police
officers,
we
contend
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
jury
which
would
justify
a
finding
of
felonious
intent
based
on
an
attempt
to
conceal,
that
was
impossible
that
in
the
circumstances.
and
so,
since
jury
found
him
guilty,
the
only
possible
basis
of
those
finding
of
guilt
must
have
been
on
the
other
branch
of
felonious
intent,
that
is
to
say
on
the
destruction
or
creating
the
reasonable
risk
of
destruction
of
the
property.
mr.

carrying
it
off
can
only
be
the
ingredients
of
larceny
if
it
is
carried
off
with
felonious
intent
and
the
presence
of
police
officers
negated
the
possibility
of
the
requisite
felonious
intent
on
the
evidence
presented
by
the
state.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well,
the
circumstances
of
a
bank
robbery
make
it
obvious
that
the
robbers
intend
if
they
can
to
get
away
with
the
haul.
the
circumstances
of
this
case
make
it
obvious
that
the
petitioner
had
no
intention
of
keeping
the
mural.
he
wants
it
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
well
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
they
have
an
intention
to
take
it
away
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
a
demonstration.
they
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
they
walked
the
few
city
blocks
with
it
in
the
presence
of
a
large
crowd
of
people
including
the
police
officers.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
the
police
recovered.
this
is
i
believe,
the
city
authorities
still
have
it
in
custody,
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
no
sir.
they're
holding
it
dependently
--
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
yes
sir,
they
have.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
three
years,
but
the
mural
was
in
the
custody
of
the
city
even
or
not
on
the
wall
of
the
city
hall.
now,
we
believe
it
is
possible
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
issue
of
the
identity
of
the
proofs
without
the
necessity
of
remanding
it
to
the
florida
court.
obviously,
if
this
court
find
itself
unable
to
resolve
the
issue
it
would
be
a
proper
one
to
send
back
to
florida.
now,
i
would
take
the
liberty
of
correcting
the
attorney
general
in
his
comment
that
the
state
is
unable
to
prosecute
for
the
destruction
of
city
property.
our
appendix
on
pages
6
and
12
presents
pertinent
state
statutes
which
do
make
it
a
misdemeanor.
in
fact,
one
of
the
three
misdemeanors
which
was
filed
and
then
dropped,
specifically
referred
to
the
destruction
or
damaging
the
city
property,
and
this
is
set
forth
on
pages
6
and
12
of
the
appendix.
in
fact,
the
state
has
an
ample
arsenal
of
statutes
that
whatever
conduct
violates
a
city
ordinance
can
pretty
well
be
assured
that
having
a
counterpart
in
the
state
statutes,
the
state
assumed
a
self
resourceful.
indeed,
in
finding
statutes,
there
are
the
points
of
violating
the
constitution
and
having
the
vagrancy
law
reversed
by
a
federal
court
recently.
and
so,
i
believe
that
if
we
require
the
state
to
have
a
single
trial
of
all
their
complaints
against
an
individual
the
prosecutor
can
find
in
their
discretion
adequate
statutory
basis
for
bringing
whatever
trial
will
appropriate.
mr.
georgieff
states
that
we
will
be
quite
prepared
to
have
our
petitioner
tried
and
sentenced
for
all
of
his
offenses
in
one
trial.
this
is
not
quite
so.
we
certainly
want
only
one
trial.
in
that
trial,
the
state
could
bring
whatever
complaints
it
wanted
to.
we
might
then
argue
that
that
they
would
be
unnecessarily
overlapping
between
the
complaints
under
rule
of
(inaudible)
case
which
holds
that
a
legislation
will
be
presumed
to
intend
multiple
punishments
arising
at
a
single
act
unless
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
states
that
multiple
punishments
are
called
for.
just
to
summarize
the
double
jeopardy
argument,
and
i
can
hope
i
can
spent
it
at
one
minute
on
the
important
issue
of
pre-sentence
reports.
we
believe
there
are
two
basis,
either
one
of
which
will
support
our
argument
on
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
one
is
compulsory
joinder.
we
assert
as
a
rule
of
constitutional
dimensions
that
the
state
should
have
only
one
trial
of
a
defendant
on
the
basis
of
a
single
act
or
course
of
conduct.
there
maybe
exceptions
to
this
rule.
for
example
if
the
victim
of
an
assault
dies
after
trial,
we
could
say
will
this
would
give
rise
to
an
exception
to
the
compulsory
joinder
rule
or
if
the
first
trial
was
a
sham.
but
in
all
that
you
clarify
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
and
also
included
within
it
the
common
law
tradition.
we
submit
that
compulsory
joinder
should
be
the
presumption
and
to
then
the
exception
needs
to
be
justified
by
the
state.
mr.
leslie
h.
levinson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
