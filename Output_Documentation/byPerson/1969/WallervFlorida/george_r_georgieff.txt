mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
wish
to
extend
something
that
is
patently
stated
in
both
documents
whether
in
florida
or
in
the
united
states
constitution,
the
question
of
what
constitutes
double
jeopardy?
counsel
tells
you
that
he's
talking
about
the
same
conduct.
i
tell
you
that
both
documents
are
the
same
offense,
not
the
same
conduct,
not
the
same
happening,
not
the
same
event,
but
the
same
offense.
here
we
have
two
courts,
the
municipal
court
and
the
court
of
record
in
pinellas
county,
florida.
now,
the
one
charge
was
the
grand
larceny
which
is
here
before
you
to
decide
whether
it
constituted
a
second
attempt
to
do
this
man
in
for
what
he
been
prosecuted
for
in
the
city
court
to
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
city
hall
in
saint
petersburg.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
city
of
saint
petersburg
and
he
was
charged
there
under
municipal
ordinances
with
the
disturbing
of
the
peace
and
i
don't
know
the
exact
wording
of
the
charge
on
the
second
one,
but
it
was
damaging
city
property.
now
obviously,
we
couldn't
prosecute
him
in
the
state
for
damaging
city
property
because
it
isn't
state
property.
we
couldn't
prosecute
him
for
disturbing
the
peace
because
we
don't
have
such
an
animal.
so,
we
have
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
at
the
state
level.
so,
the
prosecution
had
to
be
in
two
separate
courts
if
it
was
going
to
be
at
all.
now,
somebody
decided
to
prosecute
him
in
the
city
court
for
these
two
violations,
i
assume
the
city
prosecutor.
the
county
prosecutor
decided
for
one
or
another
reason
that
he
did
not
want
to
move
against
this
man
on
the
misdemeanor
charges
in
the
county
court
or
the
county
judge's
court.
now,
that
was
his
option
and
he
exercised
it
and
that's
not
here
except
to
demonstrate
that
somebody
decided
they
didn't
want
to
move
against
him.
now,
i
don't
know
what
lesser
included
has
to
do
with
it.
i
don't
see
that
disturbing
the
peace
or
destroying
this
city
property
was
a
lesser
and
included
offense
of
grand
larceny.
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
law
in
florida
says
that
you
can
commit
grand
larceny
by
destroying
property.
now,
it
may
and
i
may
stand
corrected,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
law
in
florida
no
matter
what
the
second
district
court
said.
now,
when
this
painting
was
taken
off
the
wall
either
because
it
was
offensive
or
for
any
other
reason
he
then
violated
for
the
first
time
the
state
law.
now,
we're
told
that
this
can't
be
so
because
the
separate
sovereign
theory
that
may
have
been
the
predicate
from
what
you
said
in
bartkus
and
abbate
can't
prevail
here
since
the
cities
can't
exist
without
the
express
provision
of
the
state
legislature
which
creates
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
say
the
minute
they
ripped
it
off
the
wall
and
carry
it
away
and
meant
to
keep
it
from
the
property
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
certainly,
breech
of
the
peace
was.
that
seems
to
be
the
very
first
one.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
would
you
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
tell
you
because
there
is
no
record
here
of
it.
what
went
on
in
the
city
court
was
not
made
a
matter
of
record,
i
was
not
there.
i
had
no
hand
in
it
and
i
don't
function
at
that
level,
and
i
think
mr.
levinson
did
not
either.
i
think
the
affidavit
simply
says
that
the
same
or
similar
evidence
was
introduced
at
both
hearings.
now,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
it's
simply
because
i
don't
know
what
physical
events
took
place.
the
gathering
and
don't
let
me
amplify
but
the
storming
of
the
city
hall
to
get
this
mural
off
the
wall.
i
would
assume
that
constituted
the
breech
of
the
peace,
that
would
have
been
number
one.
number
two,
the
destruction
of
the
public
for
the
city
property
would
have
been
one,
pulling
it
off
the
wall,
destroying
the
adhesion
which
was
on
there,
the
attendant
plaster
that
may
have
fallen
off
and
the
destruction
of
the
wall
on
which
it
was
attached
and
when
they
carried
it
off,
the
larceny.
so,
i
would
assume
now
that
that
ran
it
one,
two,
three
in
approximately
that
order.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
chipped
the
plaster
off
as
i
understand
it
and
damaged
the
painting
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
would
have
to
been
against
the
municipality,
it
was
their
property.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
of
course,
that's
not
here
before
you.
that's
the
part
of
the
two
that
they're
not
complaining
about.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
now
on
the
breech
of
the
peace,
there
isn't
any
such
animal
at
our
level.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right,
or
disturbing
the
peace
i
think
they
call
it,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
exact
nomenclature
is.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
city
property.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
sure
there
are
several
mr.
justice.
i
can't
recall
them
off
hand,
but
i'm
sure
there
are
several
involving
both
private
and
public.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
the
state
has
no
ownership
or
interest
in
the
city
hall
in
saint
petersburg.
it
belongs
to
the
city.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir,
in
florida.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
sir.
i
take,
it's
the
only
one
in
the
attendance
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
on
the
state
charge.
you
do
have
that,
but
you
have
no
record
whatsoever
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
you
do
not
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
under
the
separate
sovereign
theory,
yes
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
one
of
them.
i
prefer
that
you
didn't
make
me
hang
it
on
just
that
one,
but
if
i
have
to,
yes
it
is,
yes
because
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
just
as
the
states
are
to
the
federal
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
similarly,
i
would
assume
that--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir
and
i
tell
you
why.
in
florida,
i
don't
know
that
it's
true
in
any
other
state,
but
i
can
tell
you
affirmatively
that
in
florida,
when
a
city
is
structured,
now,
some
of
due
come
intervene
from
time
to
time,
most
of
them
are
already
there,
but
periodically
they
exercise
the
option
of
drafting
their
own
ordinances
or
adopting
by
one
ordinance,
all
of
the
laws
of
the
state
as
their
own
in
ordinance
form
you
see.
now,
if
they
do
the
latter,
they
are
required
to
do
one
thing
in
addition
there
too.
they
may
not
about
the
sentencing.
they
must
adopt
their
own
sentences
for
violations
of
criminal
laws
that
they
adopt
as
their
own
one
ordinance.
whereas,
if
they
take
a
separate
position
and
adopt
individual
ordinances
by
adopting
a
code
of
their
own
and
may
set
whatever
out
--
whatever
they
like
out.
so,
there
is
a
difference
when
they
take
this
or
that
course.
now
obviously,
if
they
adopt
and
they're
just
a
handful
of
that
have
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
doesn't.
they
are
simply
creatures.
they
are
not
an
arm
of
the
state.
they
don't
function
as
we
tell
them
to.
they
simply
exist
because
we
allow
them
to
have
life.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
tomorrow.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
but
i
would
imagine
before
the
congress
would
allow
puerto
rico
in,
a
certain
number
of
things
would
have
to
follow.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
i
think
that's
meaningless
in
this
argument
today
because
he's
told
you
that
if
you
brought
all
three
of
these
in
one
court,
he
wouldn't
be
here
complaining
about
it
and
that
is
what
he
said.
he
says
under
compulsory
joinder,
if
you
were
to
move
against
mr.
waller
on
all
three
of
these
in
one
court,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
jeopardy
and
we
wouldn't
even
be
here.
so,
he
cannot
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
he's
got
to
have
it
one
way
or
the
other.
to
mr.
waller,
i
would
imagine,
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
that
he
sits
in
jail
under
one
theory
or
the
other.
if
it
jeopardy
it
is,
and
if
it
isn't,
it
isn't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
sure
of
that.
but,
i
don't
quarrel
about
the
idea
that
if
it
is
jeopardy,
it
ought
to
be
put
aside.
i
say
if
it
isn't
jeopardy,
it
isn't
made
jeopardy
by
the
fact
it
was
done
in
the
different
court.
now,
we
were
told
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
part
of
the
same
transaction,
is
it
all
one
open
situation
that
nobody
hiding
or
stealthily
doing
this
that
or
the
other.
what
seems
to
me
that
if
that's
the
rule
then
what
we
wind
up
with
is
if
you
hold
an
audience,
call
an
audience
before
you
commit
your
crime,
then
that's
the
defense
to
the
crime
of
larceny.
i
don't
understand
it
that
way
and
counsel
tells
us
about
compulsory
joinder.
who's
compulsory
joinder?
i
don't
know
what
that
is?
there
is
no
such
creature,
not
in
existence
in
florida
today.
he
may
have
asked
for
it,
although
the
record
doesn't'
even
reflect
that
he
did
that,
but
the
point
is
how
can
we
complain
about
they
should
have
been
brought
in
the
same
court?
the
point
is,
he
didn't
ask
for
it
and
they
were
not
and
structurally,
florida
could
have
moved
against
him
in
one
court
for
these
three
offenses.
now,
the
question
of
benton
--
we're
told
about
benton
in
doing
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing.
i
don't
pretend
to
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall
what
you
meant
in
benton.
all
i
will
tell
you
is
that
it
gives
a
complaining
citizen
another
reason
to
complain
about
jeopardy,
that's
all
it
does,
very
much
the
same
as
matt
did
on
search
and
seizure
and
gideon
did
as
to
counsel.
now
benton
didn't
change
anything.
it
simply
says
that
here
after,
it
will
be
a
federally
assured
right
under
which
people
can
complain
when
they
think
they've
been
placed
in
jeopardy
twice
for
the
same
offense,
not
for
the
same
course
of
conduct.
now,
if
you
want
to
restructure
the
word
offense
to
make
it
mean
the
same
course
of
conduct,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
you
are
going
to
stick
to
offense
that's
what
has
to
be
done
and
it
is
simply
not
the
same
offense.
it
is
a
series
of
acts,
each
one
of
which
constituted
a
separate
offense,
two
against
one
sovereign,
one
against
another.
since
he
doesn't
complain
about
the
180-day
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
the
city
complaint,
but
only
complains
about
the
grand
larceny
charge
which
didn't
include
the
other
two
then
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
does
not
come
up.
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
become
a
collateral
estoppel
simply
because
we
decide
we're
going
to
make
it
something
other
than
the
same
offense.
well
in
collateral
estoppel
you
have
to
have
an
acquittal
in
order
to
have
some
adjudication
of
some
question
that's
going
to
be
involved
in
the
other
situation
and
that
you
certainly
didn't
have
here.
so,
i
submit
that
collateral
estoppel
can't
apply.
i'll
give
you
a
good
hypothetical.
how
about
the
man
who
kills
two
people
in
let's
say
in
a
span
of
four
or
five
minutes
in
an
automobile.
he
pleads
insanity
when
he's
charged
with
the
killing
of
the
first
one,
and
the
jury
acquits
him.
then
the
state
seeks
to
try
him
on
the
second
one
and
he
moves
to
prohibit
them
by
saying
well
now
look
here,
you
acquitted
me
and
it
must
have
been
obvious
that
you
did
so
because
you
found
me
insane,
and
therefore,
considering
this
my
insanity
of
time,
it's
absurd
to
say
that
i
could
have
been
insane
at
this
time,
wasn't
at
the
second
one.
but
the
question
is
suppose,
suppose
the
jury
have
found
him
guilty,
is
it
just
possible
that
somebody
would
suggest
that
he's
precluded
from
raising
the
defense
of
insanity
on
the
second
go
around
because
the
verdict
of
guilty
precluded
that?
no,
it
does
not
and
we
don't
have
mutuality
here.
it
weren't
the
same
issues,
it
weren't
the
same
sovereigns,
it
weren't
the
same
victims,
city
the
victim
in
the
first;
state
the
victim
in
the
second.
same
defendant,
admitted;
covered
a
short
span
of
time;
admitted,
but
not
the
same
facts,
no
mutuality,
no
collateral
estoppel.
the
question
of
whether
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
should
have
been
made
public.
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
role
that
plays
in
this,
i
suspect
probably
not
a
great
deal.
but
you
are
to
recall
into
the
federal
rules,
federal
district
judges
are
free
to
make
them
available
to
counsel
or
not
as
it
happens
to
suit
them.
now,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
if
they
decide
not
to
give
this
information
to
defense
counsel
and
so
exercise
their
discretion,
it
is
not
reversible
error.
i
submit
that
in
florida,
though
some
courts
have
been
heard
to
do
this,
it
is
the
rule
in
florida
that
they
are
secret
and
they
are
not
to
be
made
available
to
counsel
but
only
available
to
the
court
for
such
information
as
they
may
take
from
it.
if
it
isn't
a
violation
of
law
for
the
federal
courts
not
to
make
these
available
on
the
discretionary
basis
then
how
can
it
be
for
the
state
court
not
to
give
it
to
counsel
in
this
instance?
it
is
the
same
psi
report.
it's
very
much
the
same
as
what
we
do
in
the
confidential
informant.
we
don't
allow
the
man
to
be
bedeviled
by
people
who
want
to
challenge
what
the
informants
may
say
about
him,
the
neighbors,
the
one
thing
and
another.
counsel
says
to
you
we
want
to
have
the
opportunity
to
check
this
to
see
if
hearsay
comes
up,
to
see
if
inaccuracies
are
there.
the
only
way
he
can
do
that
is
to
go
to
the
people
whose
names
appear
in
the
psi
and
tell
them,
“look!
why
did
you
say
this,
and
you're
wrong
this
that
the
other,
you
must
come
in
and
you
must
correct
it.
they'll
harass
him
and
you
dry
up
the
well
spring,
but
beyond
that,
this
doesn't
go
to
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence.”
in
florida,
the
psi
has
no
function
whatsoever
unless
and
until
a
guilty
verdict
is
found.
when
it's
found,
there
is
an
adjudication.
then
the
judge
orders
a
pre-sentence
report
and
he
uses
this
as
a
predicate
for
wherever
sentence
he
imposes
and
if
the
sentence
is
one
that's
well
within
the
limits
prescribe
by
law
and
this
one
is,
six
months
to
five
years,
then
the
sentence
in
florida
is
not
reviewable,
that
is
the
law
in
florida.
they
will
not
review
the
sentence,
if
it's
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
law.
this
one
was
six
months
to
five
years,
well
within
it.
psi
couldn't
made
any
difference
whether
it's
available
or
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
six
months
to
five
years
sir.
all
sentences
now
on
florida
for
anything
less
than
capital
must
be
predicated
on
a
six-month
minimum,
and
that
is
to
say
believe
it
or
not
that
six
months
and
one
day
conceivably
a
man
could
be
turned
loose
on
parole,
but
not
before
six
months.
all
sentences
that
can
be
given
a
year
--
year
sentence
must
have
a
six
months
minimum
and
the
maximum
can
go
to
any
number
of
years
less
than
life.
now
life
and
of
course
a
terminal
sentence
and
subject
to
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
did
not
go
to
the
supreme
court.
it
went
to
the
district
court
and
the
certiorari
was
brought
here
to
that
district
court,
the
intermediate
appellant
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
now
as
i
say
now,
they
affirmed
the
judgment.
they
don't
affirm
sentences
your
honor.
i
guess
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
they'll
review
convictions
and
judgments,
but
they
won't
review
sentences
unless
the
sentence
is
patently
in
excess
of
that
provided
by
law.
all
they'll
look
to
is
to
see
whether
it's
within
the
limits
prescribed.
if
it
is,
they
won't
disturb
it
as
being
excessive
or
otherwise.
now,
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
they
are
often
are
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
shall
be
glad
if
that's
included
in
that,
but
quite
often,
even
when
they
--
i
will
assume
when
they
don't
want
to
particularly
say
anything
about
it.
they
may
include
it
in
the
phrase
such
as
that,
but
it
was
brought
to
their
attention,
made
a
part
of
their
complaint.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
there
was
some
eight
points
involved
in
the
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
in
any
case,
it's
our
position
very
simply
whether
you
view
it
under
bartkus
or
abbate,
with
or
without
benton,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
can't
have
jeopardy
here
because
you
don't
have
the
same
offense.
not
because
the
sovereigns
are
different,
but
because
the
act
is
different.
one
constitutes
an
offense
against
the
municipality,
the
other
one
is
separate
felony.
not
an
offense
against
a
municipality.
i
would
say
the
same
if
it
been
in
the
county
court
where
we
don't
have
the
question
about
the
sovereigns.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
say
that
you
have
to
have
the
same
offense
unless
you
mean
to
restructure
double
jeopardy
to
make
it
the
same
course
of
conduct.
and
if
you're
not
going
to
that,
if
you
mean
to
have
double
jeopardy
stand
as
the
florida
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution
proscribe
it
then
we're
talking
about
the
same
offense
or
as
it
used
to
be
said,
crime.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and
carried
it
off,
and
carried
it
off.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
damaging
sir,
i
think
it
was.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
when
they
started
to
tear
it
off
and
the
plaster
came
off,
the
adhesive,
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
for
a
point,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
after
it
came
off
the
wall.
then,
they
cut
it
off.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
i
would
assume,
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
hard
to
put
to
be
accurate
about
that,
not
too
far.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
got
away
with
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
perhaps
by
a
tenth
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
not
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
afraid
if
i
say
yes
to
that,
i'll
agree
that
it's
so
minute
that
it
isn't
worth
any
discussion.
i
agree
that
there
is
that
difference,
but
the
difference
is
vast
when
we
steal
that
which
we
damaged.
you
can
damage
it
without
stealing
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it
was
also
in
the
carrying
away
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
they
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right.
now
that
the
mural
was
damaged
and
was
recovered
in
the
damaged
condition,
beside
of
that
fact
that
it
was
carried
off.
but
the
damage
that
the
city
complained
about
and
was
made
actionable
against
waller
was
a
damaged
to
the
structure
from
which
it
was
taken,
a
different
kind,
perhaps
minute,
but
nevertheless,
different.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
no,
you're
not
and
it's
a
painful
reminder.
i
don't
know
whether
silos
preferable
or
correct
this,
i
can't
tell
you
which
i
rather
go
to.
however,
their
outcome
was
correct,
even
though
their
reason
was
wrong
and
i
don't
know
how
much
of
this
will
get
back
to
them
but
in
any
case
that's
my
problem.
i
don't
care
what
they
said,
my
sins
are
enough
for
me
to
pay
for
it.
the
point
is
if
they
reach
the
proper
result,
i
don't
care
that
they
gave
the
wrong
reason.
my
contention
is
that
the
acts
or
offenses
or
crimes
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
were
separate
and
distinct
and
that
they
gave
a
wrong
reason
is
to
me
relatively
unimportant.
you're
not
bound
by
what
they
say.
it
never
happened
in
the
past
and
i
don't
suspect
it
will
be
in
the
future.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
done
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
like
to
see
to
something
when
it
so
minute
that
i
may
go
into
tank
without
knowing
about
it.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
find
when
one
stopped
and
the
other
begin,
but
they
couldn't
carried
away
until
they
got
it
off
the
wall,
so
obviously,
there's
a
difference.
i
don't
know
how
much
and
nobody
seemed
to
remember
those
particulars
since
we
don't
have
the
record
of
the
municipal
prosecution.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct
sir,
and
i
wish
as
much
as
mr.
levinson
and
the
court
that
it
was
here,
but
it
is
not
and
i
don't
know
how
to
restructure
that.
it's
our
position
in
the
face
of
the
matter
puts
to
you
today
that
the
action
of
the
district
court
below,
even
if
for
the
wrong
reason
should
be
affirmed
today.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
wish
to
extend
something
that
is
patently
stated
in
both
documents
whether
in
florida
or
in
the
united
states
constitution,
the
question
of
what
constitutes
double
jeopardy?
counsel
tells
you
that
he's
talking
about
the
same
conduct.
i
tell
you
that
both
documents
are
the
same
offense,
not
the
same
conduct,
not
the
same
happening,
not
the
same
event,
but
the
same
offense.
here
we
have
two
courts,
the
municipal
court
and
the
court
of
record
in
pinellas
county,
florida.
now,
the
one
charge
was
the
grand
larceny
which
is
here
before
you
to
decide
whether
it
constituted
a
second
attempt
to
do
this
man
in
for
what
he
been
prosecuted
for
in
the
city
court
to
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
city
hall
in
saint
petersburg.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
city
of
saint
petersburg
and
he
was
charged
there
under
municipal
ordinances
with
the
disturbing
of
the
peace
and
i
don't
know
the
exact
wording
of
the
charge
on
the
second
one,
but
it
was
damaging
city
property.
now
obviously,
we
couldn't
prosecute
him
in
the
state
for
damaging
city
property
because
it
isn't
state
property.
we
couldn't
prosecute
him
for
disturbing
the
peace
because
we
don't
have
such
an
animal.
so,
we
have
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
at
the
state
level.
so,
the
prosecution
had
to
be
in
two
separate
courts
if
it
was
going
to
be
at
all.
now,
somebody
decided
to
prosecute
him
in
the
city
court
for
these
two
violations,
i
assume
the
city
prosecutor.
the
county
prosecutor
decided
for
one
or
another
reason
that
he
did
not
want
to
move
against
this
man
on
the
misdemeanor
charges
in
the
county
court
or
the
county
judge's
court.
now,
that
was
his
option
and
he
exercised
it
and
that's
not
here
except
to
demonstrate
that
somebody
decided
they
didn't
want
to
move
against
him.
now,
i
don't
know
what
lesser
included
has
to
do
with
it.
i
don't
see
that
disturbing
the
peace
or
destroying
this
city
property
was
a
lesser
and
included
offense
of
grand
larceny.
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
law
in
florida
says
that
you
can
commit
grand
larceny
by
destroying
property.
now,
it
may
and
i
may
stand
corrected,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
law
in
florida
no
matter
what
the
second
district
court
said.
now,
when
this
painting
was
taken
off
the
wall
either
because
it
was
offensive
or
for
any
other
reason
he
then
violated
for
the
first
time
the
state
law.
now,
we're
told
that
this
can't
be
so
because
the
separate
sovereign
theory
that
may
have
been
the
predicate
from
what
you
said
in
bartkus
and
abbate
can't
prevail
here
since
the
cities
can't
exist
without
the
express
provision
of
the
state
legislature
which
creates
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
say
the
minute
they
ripped
it
off
the
wall
and
carry
it
away
and
meant
to
keep
it
from
the
property
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
certainly,
breech
of
the
peace
was.
that
seems
to
be
the
very
first
one.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
would
you
believe
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
tell
you
because
there
is
no
record
here
of
it.
what
went
on
in
the
city
court
was
not
made
a
matter
of
record,
i
was
not
there.
i
had
no
hand
in
it
and
i
don't
function
at
that
level,
and
i
think
mr.
levinson
did
not
either.
i
think
the
affidavit
simply
says
that
the
same
or
similar
evidence
was
introduced
at
both
hearings.
now,
i
cannot
tell
you
and
it's
simply
because
i
don't
know
what
physical
events
took
place.
the
gathering
and
don't
let
me
amplify
but
the
storming
of
the
city
hall
to
get
this
mural
off
the
wall.
i
would
assume
that
constituted
the
breech
of
the
peace,
that
would
have
been
number
one.
number
two,
the
destruction
of
the
public
for
the
city
property
would
have
been
one,
pulling
it
off
the
wall,
destroying
the
adhesion
which
was
on
there,
the
attendant
plaster
that
may
have
fallen
off
and
the
destruction
of
the
wall
on
which
it
was
attached
and
when
they
carried
it
off,
the
larceny.
so,
i
would
assume
now
that
that
ran
it
one,
two,
three
in
approximately
that
order.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
chipped
the
plaster
off
as
i
understand
it
and
damaged
the
painting
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
would
have
to
been
against
the
municipality,
it
was
their
property.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
of
course,
that's
not
here
before
you.
that's
the
part
of
the
two
that
they're
not
complaining
about.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
now
on
the
breech
of
the
peace,
there
isn't
any
such
animal
at
our
level.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right,
or
disturbing
the
peace
i
think
they
call
it,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
exact
nomenclature
is.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
city
property.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
sure
there
are
several
mr.
justice.
i
can't
recall
them
off
hand,
but
i'm
sure
there
are
several
involving
both
private
and
public.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
the
state
has
no
ownership
or
interest
in
the
city
hall
in
saint
petersburg.
it
belongs
to
the
city.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir,
in
florida.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
sir.
i
take,
it's
the
only
one
in
the
attendance
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
on
the
state
charge.
you
do
have
that,
but
you
have
no
record
whatsoever
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
you
do
not
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
under
the
separate
sovereign
theory,
yes
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
one
of
them.
i
prefer
that
you
didn't
make
me
hang
it
on
just
that
one,
but
if
i
have
to,
yes
it
is,
yes
because
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
just
as
the
states
are
to
the
federal
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
similarly,
i
would
assume
that--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir
and
i
tell
you
why.
in
florida,
i
don't
know
that
it's
true
in
any
other
state,
but
i
can
tell
you
affirmatively
that
in
florida,
when
a
city
is
structured,
now,
some
of
due
come
intervene
from
time
to
time,
most
of
them
are
already
there,
but
periodically
they
exercise
the
option
of
drafting
their
own
ordinances
or
adopting
by
one
ordinance,
all
of
the
laws
of
the
state
as
their
own
in
ordinance
form
you
see.
now,
if
they
do
the
latter,
they
are
required
to
do
one
thing
in
addition
there
too.
they
may
not
about
the
sentencing.
they
must
adopt
their
own
sentences
for
violations
of
criminal
laws
that
they
adopt
as
their
own
one
ordinance.
whereas,
if
they
take
a
separate
position
and
adopt
individual
ordinances
by
adopting
a
code
of
their
own
and
may
set
whatever
out
--
whatever
they
like
out.
so,
there
is
a
difference
when
they
take
this
or
that
course.
now
obviously,
if
they
adopt
and
they're
just
a
handful
of
that
have
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
doesn't.
they
are
simply
creatures.
they
are
not
an
arm
of
the
state.
they
don't
function
as
we
tell
them
to.
they
simply
exist
because
we
allow
them
to
have
life.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
tomorrow.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
but
i
would
imagine
before
the
congress
would
allow
puerto
rico
in,
a
certain
number
of
things
would
have
to
follow.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
i
think
that's
meaningless
in
this
argument
today
because
he's
told
you
that
if
you
brought
all
three
of
these
in
one
court,
he
wouldn't
be
here
complaining
about
it
and
that
is
what
he
said.
he
says
under
compulsory
joinder,
if
you
were
to
move
against
mr.
waller
on
all
three
of
these
in
one
court,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
jeopardy
and
we
wouldn't
even
be
here.
so,
he
cannot
have
the
best
of
both
worlds.
he's
got
to
have
it
one
way
or
the
other.
to
mr.
waller,
i
would
imagine,
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
that
he
sits
in
jail
under
one
theory
or
the
other.
if
it
jeopardy
it
is,
and
if
it
isn't,
it
isn't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
sure
of
that.
but,
i
don't
quarrel
about
the
idea
that
if
it
is
jeopardy,
it
ought
to
be
put
aside.
i
say
if
it
isn't
jeopardy,
it
isn't
made
jeopardy
by
the
fact
it
was
done
in
the
different
court.
now,
we
were
told
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
part
of
the
same
transaction,
is
it
all
one
open
situation
that
nobody
hiding
or
stealthily
doing
this
that
or
the
other.
what
seems
to
me
that
if
that's
the
rule
then
what
we
wind
up
with
is
if
you
hold
an
audience,
call
an
audience
before
you
commit
your
crime,
then
that's
the
defense
to
the
crime
of
larceny.
i
don't
understand
it
that
way
and
counsel
tells
us
about
compulsory
joinder.
who's
compulsory
joinder?
i
don't
know
what
that
is?
there
is
no
such
creature,
not
in
existence
in
florida
today.
he
may
have
asked
for
it,
although
the
record
doesn't'
even
reflect
that
he
did
that,
but
the
point
is
how
can
we
complain
about
they
should
have
been
brought
in
the
same
court?
the
point
is,
he
didn't
ask
for
it
and
they
were
not
and
structurally,
florida
could
have
moved
against
him
in
one
court
for
these
three
offenses.
now,
the
question
of
benton
--
we're
told
about
benton
in
doing
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing.
i
don't
pretend
to
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall
what
you
meant
in
benton.
all
i
will
tell
you
is
that
it
gives
a
complaining
citizen
another
reason
to
complain
about
jeopardy,
that's
all
it
does,
very
much
the
same
as
matt
did
on
search
and
seizure
and
gideon
did
as
to
counsel.
now
benton
didn't
change
anything.
it
simply
says
that
here
after,
it
will
be
a
federally
assured
right
under
which
people
can
complain
when
they
think
they've
been
placed
in
jeopardy
twice
for
the
same
offense,
not
for
the
same
course
of
conduct.
now,
if
you
want
to
restructure
the
word
offense
to
make
it
mean
the
same
course
of
conduct,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
you
are
going
to
stick
to
offense
that's
what
has
to
be
done
and
it
is
simply
not
the
same
offense.
it
is
a
series
of
acts,
each
one
of
which
constituted
a
separate
offense,
two
against
one
sovereign,
one
against
another.
since
he
doesn't
complain
about
the
180-day
sentence
which
was
imposed
on
the
city
complaint,
but
only
complains
about
the
grand
larceny
charge
which
didn't
include
the
other
two
then
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
does
not
come
up.
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
become
a
collateral
estoppel
simply
because
we
decide
we're
going
to
make
it
something
other
than
the
same
offense.
well
in
collateral
estoppel
you
have
to
have
an
acquittal
in
order
to
have
some
adjudication
of
some
question
that's
going
to
be
involved
in
the
other
situation
and
that
you
certainly
didn't
have
here.
so,
i
submit
that
collateral
estoppel
can't
apply.
i'll
give
you
a
good
hypothetical.
how
about
the
man
who
kills
two
people
in
let's
say
in
a
span
of
four
or
five
minutes
in
an
automobile.
he
pleads
insanity
when
he's
charged
with
the
killing
of
the
first
one,
and
the
jury
acquits
him.
then
the
state
seeks
to
try
him
on
the
second
one
and
he
moves
to
prohibit
them
by
saying
well
now
look
here,
you
acquitted
me
and
it
must
have
been
obvious
that
you
did
so
because
you
found
me
insane,
and
therefore,
considering
this
my
insanity
of
time,
it's
absurd
to
say
that
i
could
have
been
insane
at
this
time,
wasn't
at
the
second
one.
but
the
question
is
suppose,
suppose
the
jury
have
found
him
guilty,
is
it
just
possible
that
somebody
would
suggest
that
he's
precluded
from
raising
the
defense
of
insanity
on
the
second
go
around
because
the
verdict
of
guilty
precluded
that?
no,
it
does
not
and
we
don't
have
mutuality
here.
it
weren't
the
same
issues,
it
weren't
the
same
sovereigns,
it
weren't
the
same
victims,
city
the
victim
in
the
first;
state
the
victim
in
the
second.
same
defendant,
admitted;
covered
a
short
span
of
time;
admitted,
but
not
the
same
facts,
no
mutuality,
no
collateral
estoppel.
the
question
of
whether
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
should
have
been
made
public.
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
role
that
plays
in
this,
i
suspect
probably
not
a
great
deal.
but
you
are
to
recall
into
the
federal
rules,
federal
district
judges
are
free
to
make
them
available
to
counsel
or
not
as
it
happens
to
suit
them.
now,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
if
they
decide
not
to
give
this
information
to
defense
counsel
and
so
exercise
their
discretion,
it
is
not
reversible
error.
i
submit
that
in
florida,
though
some
courts
have
been
heard
to
do
this,
it
is
the
rule
in
florida
that
they
are
secret
and
they
are
not
to
be
made
available
to
counsel
but
only
available
to
the
court
for
such
information
as
they
may
take
from
it.
if
it
isn't
a
violation
of
law
for
the
federal
courts
not
to
make
these
available
on
the
discretionary
basis
then
how
can
it
be
for
the
state
court
not
to
give
it
to
counsel
in
this
instance?
it
is
the
same
psi
report.
it's
very
much
the
same
as
what
we
do
in
the
confidential
informant.
we
don't
allow
the
man
to
be
bedeviled
by
people
who
want
to
challenge
what
the
informants
may
say
about
him,
the
neighbors,
the
one
thing
and
another.
counsel
says
to
you
we
want
to
have
the
opportunity
to
check
this
to
see
if
hearsay
comes
up,
to
see
if
inaccuracies
are
there.
the
only
way
he
can
do
that
is
to
go
to
the
people
whose
names
appear
in
the
psi
and
tell
them,
“look!
why
did
you
say
this,
and
you're
wrong
this
that
the
other,
you
must
come
in
and
you
must
correct
it.
they'll
harass
him
and
you
dry
up
the
well
spring,
but
beyond
that,
this
doesn't
go
to
the
man's
guilt
or
innocence.”
in
florida,
the
psi
has
no
function
whatsoever
unless
and
until
a
guilty
verdict
is
found.
when
it's
found,
there
is
an
adjudication.
then
the
judge
orders
a
pre-sentence
report
and
he
uses
this
as
a
predicate
for
wherever
sentence
he
imposes
and
if
the
sentence
is
one
that's
well
within
the
limits
prescribe
by
law
and
this
one
is,
six
months
to
five
years,
then
the
sentence
in
florida
is
not
reviewable,
that
is
the
law
in
florida.
they
will
not
review
the
sentence,
if
it's
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
law.
this
one
was
six
months
to
five
years,
well
within
it.
psi
couldn't
made
any
difference
whether
it's
available
or
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
six
months
to
five
years
sir.
all
sentences
now
on
florida
for
anything
less
than
capital
must
be
predicated
on
a
six-month
minimum,
and
that
is
to
say
believe
it
or
not
that
six
months
and
one
day
conceivably
a
man
could
be
turned
loose
on
parole,
but
not
before
six
months.
all
sentences
that
can
be
given
a
year
--
year
sentence
must
have
a
six
months
minimum
and
the
maximum
can
go
to
any
number
of
years
less
than
life.
now
life
and
of
course
a
terminal
sentence
and
subject
to
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
did
not
go
to
the
supreme
court.
it
went
to
the
district
court
and
the
certiorari
was
brought
here
to
that
district
court,
the
intermediate
appellant
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
now
as
i
say
now,
they
affirmed
the
judgment.
they
don't
affirm
sentences
your
honor.
i
guess
what
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
they'll
review
convictions
and
judgments,
but
they
won't
review
sentences
unless
the
sentence
is
patently
in
excess
of
that
provided
by
law.
all
they'll
look
to
is
to
see
whether
it's
within
the
limits
prescribed.
if
it
is,
they
won't
disturb
it
as
being
excessive
or
otherwise.
now,
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh,
they
are
often
are
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
shall
be
glad
if
that's
included
in
that,
but
quite
often,
even
when
they
--
i
will
assume
when
they
don't
want
to
particularly
say
anything
about
it.
they
may
include
it
in
the
phrase
such
as
that,
but
it
was
brought
to
their
attention,
made
a
part
of
their
complaint.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
there
was
some
eight
points
involved
in
the
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
in
any
case,
it's
our
position
very
simply
whether
you
view
it
under
bartkus
or
abbate,
with
or
without
benton,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
can't
have
jeopardy
here
because
you
don't
have
the
same
offense.
not
because
the
sovereigns
are
different,
but
because
the
act
is
different.
one
constitutes
an
offense
against
the
municipality,
the
other
one
is
separate
felony.
not
an
offense
against
a
municipality.
i
would
say
the
same
if
it
been
in
the
county
court
where
we
don't
have
the
question
about
the
sovereigns.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
say
that
you
have
to
have
the
same
offense
unless
you
mean
to
restructure
double
jeopardy
to
make
it
the
same
course
of
conduct.
and
if
you're
not
going
to
that,
if
you
mean
to
have
double
jeopardy
stand
as
the
florida
constitution
and
the
federal
constitution
proscribe
it
then
we're
talking
about
the
same
offense
or
as
it
used
to
be
said,
crime.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and
carried
it
off,
and
carried
it
off.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
damaging
sir,
i
think
it
was.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
when
they
started
to
tear
it
off
and
the
plaster
came
off,
the
adhesive,
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
for
a
point,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
after
it
came
off
the
wall.
then,
they
cut
it
off.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
i
would
assume,
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
hard
to
put
to
be
accurate
about
that,
not
too
far.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
got
away
with
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
perhaps
by
a
tenth
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
not
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
afraid
if
i
say
yes
to
that,
i'll
agree
that
it's
so
minute
that
it
isn't
worth
any
discussion.
i
agree
that
there
is
that
difference,
but
the
difference
is
vast
when
we
steal
that
which
we
damaged.
you
can
damage
it
without
stealing
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it
was
also
in
the
carrying
away
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
they
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right.
now
that
the
mural
was
damaged
and
was
recovered
in
the
damaged
condition,
beside
of
that
fact
that
it
was
carried
off.
but
the
damage
that
the
city
complained
about
and
was
made
actionable
against
waller
was
a
damaged
to
the
structure
from
which
it
was
taken,
a
different
kind,
perhaps
minute,
but
nevertheless,
different.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
no,
you're
not
and
it's
a
painful
reminder.
i
don't
know
whether
silos
preferable
or
correct
this,
i
can't
tell
you
which
i
rather
go
to.
however,
their
outcome
was
correct,
even
though
their
reason
was
wrong
and
i
don't
know
how
much
of
this
will
get
back
to
them
but
in
any
case
that's
my
problem.
i
don't
care
what
they
said,
my
sins
are
enough
for
me
to
pay
for
it.
the
point
is
if
they
reach
the
proper
result,
i
don't
care
that
they
gave
the
wrong
reason.
my
contention
is
that
the
acts
or
offenses
or
crimes
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
were
separate
and
distinct
and
that
they
gave
a
wrong
reason
is
to
me
relatively
unimportant.
you're
not
bound
by
what
they
say.
it
never
happened
in
the
past
and
i
don't
suspect
it
will
be
in
the
future.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
done
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
like
to
see
to
something
when
it
so
minute
that
i
may
go
into
tank
without
knowing
about
it.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
find
when
one
stopped
and
the
other
begin,
but
they
couldn't
carried
away
until
they
got
it
off
the
wall,
so
obviously,
there's
a
difference.
i
don't
know
how
much
and
nobody
seemed
to
remember
those
particulars
since
we
don't
have
the
record
of
the
municipal
prosecution.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct
sir,
and
i
wish
as
much
as
mr.
levinson
and
the
court
that
it
was
here,
but
it
is
not
and
i
don't
know
how
to
restructure
that.
it's
our
position
in
the
face
of
the
matter
puts
to
you
today
that
the
action
of
the
district
court
below,
even
if
for
the
wrong
reason
should
be
affirmed
today.
thank
you.
