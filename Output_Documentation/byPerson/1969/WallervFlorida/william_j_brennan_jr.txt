justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
you
prevail
on
that
point,
what
do
you
suggest
be
done
with
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
do
you
--
what
is
the
florida
double
jeopardy
rule,
same
transaction
or
same
evidence,
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
last
time
as
i
read
this
opinion,
they
went
off
on
the
so-called
to
sovereign
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
don't
tell
us
what
their
double
jeopardy
rule
would
be
if
they
were
advised
that
they
can't
apply
with
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
suggest
then
that
--
as
i
understand
it,
as
far
as
you
know
the
identical
facts
that
established
the
municipal
conviction
were
the
facts
on
which
the
grand
larceny
conviction
is
based?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
suggesting
that
in
that
set
of
facts,
stanford
holds
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
grand
larceny
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
this
my
question
assume
the
premise
that
we
agree
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
should
we
apply
the
stanford
rule
or
let
the
florida
court's
apply
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
served
a
city
sentence
in
one
city
jail
and
the
state
sentence
was
in
state
penitentiary
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
georgieff,
may
i
ask
you.
the
affidavit
in
which
refer
is
this
mr.,
waller's
affidavit
on
page
15
and
16?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
--
that
it
is
before
the
trial
than
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
make
complete
characters
referred
--
that's
final
knowledge
of
the
belief?
direct
information
with
grand
larceny
made
solely
upon
allegation
to
the
engagement
--
that
is
the
conduct
alleged
in
the
prosecution
in
the
district
court.
if
you
don't
know
the
lead
of
--
if
remand
any
affidavit
anywhere
perhaps
there
is
a
record
of
what
happened,
i
guess
you
would
unable
to
work
with
this
files
as
this
information
grand
larceny?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
any
representation
that
what
we
have
here
is
having
been
offered
as
evidence
on
the
grand
larceny
charge,
the
same
evidence
that
was
offered
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
order
that
the
rational
of
following
--
it's
a
rational
of
body
binds
the
relationship
of
this
conduct
to
a
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
gather,
what
we
dealt
within
the
body
was
the
questionable
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
a
state
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prosecution
for
the
same
conduct?
you
think
that
the
body
at
least
support
two
sovereign
theory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
still
don't
understand
how
old
is
just
rational
of
a
body
advice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you
think
of
them--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
whether
or
not
a
state
and
federal
government
could
prosecute
a
man
for
the
same
conduct
(inaudible)

william
j.
