do
you
have
a

against
malicious

property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
state
statue
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
maliciously
destruct
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
when
they
damaged
that
wall,
there
was
a
violation
of
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
maliciously
destroy
a
person's
private
property,
isn't
that
a
violation
of
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
would
be
the
same
for
the
city,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
because
it
set
in
sovereignty
of
business,
is
that
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
say
that
the
state
crime
occurred
when
they
ripped
this
mural
off
the
wall?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
the
city
crime
of
destroying
the
city
property
start?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
that
start?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they
both
started,
both
crimes
started
at
the
exact
same
time
involving
the
exact
same
instrument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
they
end
at
the
same
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
the
city
crime
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then.
that's
when
the
city
crime
ended?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
they
carried
it
off
--
how
far
did
they
take
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
too
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
few
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
10
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that's
the
only
difference
between
the
facts
of
the
two
crimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
understood
that
your
district
court
said
that
the
crime
isn't
the
damaging,
that's
what
made
it
larceny?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
they
put
emphasis
on
the
damages,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
we
got
two
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
the
city
ever
put
the
mural
back?
that,
i
do
not
know
sir.
i've
not
been
down
there
and
i
don't
know
and
i've
not
heard.
perhaps,
mr.
levinson
can
tell
you,
i
don't
know.
in
any
case,
i
say
very
simply,
i
don't
care
whether
we
view
it
with
or
without
benton.
i'm
not
relying
on
the
separate
sovereign
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else.
i
say
that
separate
acts
occurred.
i
prefer
to
call
them
crimes
but
the
word
used
is
offense.
now,
if
he
can
show
after
flaw
acquit
or
a
convict,
he's
in
business
and
we
all
know
it.
there's
no
use
of
kidding
ourselves,
but
he
can't
do
that.
he's
saying
because
i
did
three
things
in
a
short
interval,
what
you
should
do
is
now
extend
the
protection
of
double
jeopardy
to
me
and
i
say,
unless
you
want
to
redo
it,
you
ought
not
to
and
you
ought
to
affirm
the
action
of
the
district
court
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
real
problem
is
it.
we
don't
have
that
record
of
that
events.
justice
thurgood

do
you
have
a

malicious
