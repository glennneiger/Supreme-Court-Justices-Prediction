mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
i
will
never
--
to
be
as
brief
as
possible.
i
would
direct
my
remarks
to
two
factors,
one,
the
justification
for
the
component
district
system
of
election.
and
secondly,
that
the
junior
college
district
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
general
governing
body
in
the
sense
that
it's
discussed
in
avery.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
officers
as
i
see
them
in
electing
trustees
of
this
junior
college
district
are
three,
possibly
four
as
an
alternative.
one,
they
could
be
elected
at
large,
two,
they
could
be
elected
from
equal
arbitrarily
drawn
election
districts
and
three,
they
can
be
elected
from
the
component
public
school
districts
as
in
fact
as
the
statute
here.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
yes
and
in
particular
this
question
was
brought
out
earlier
and
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
said
that
there
were
a
slight
chance
of
this
happening
in
fact
but
i
know
in
kansas
city
public
school
district,
where
directors
were
formerly
elected
at
large
that
it
is
either
four
of
the
six
or
five
of
the
six
who
come
from
the
same
high
school
attendants
area.
so
this
is
what
would
happen
we
feel
at
an
at
large
election
which
justifies
the
legislature
and
not
using
the
at
large
method.
further,
i
think
the
at
large
method
although
if
you
can
mathematically
say
one
man's
vote
is
equal
to
another
dilutes
minority's
effectiveness
in
the
community.
this
is
true
of
the
negro
population,
the
rural
population
and
may
be
the
inner
city
population.
they
could
not
in
many
cases
as
a
practical
matter
elect
a
trustee
who
represented
their
interest.
even
where
there
is
a
residence
qualification,
is
off
times
the
case
that
the
persons
elected
are
favorable
to
the
majority
grouping
although
they
physically
reside
in
one
other
--
in
another
area.
i
think
that
some
distinction
between
the
junior
college
district
and
public
school
districts
in
general
must
be
made
at
the
outset.
junior
college
--
public
school
districts
directors
have
always
been
elected
at
large
in
missouri
with
one
exception
that
was
recently
made.
in
comparison
junior
college
district
directors
are
elected
from
component
school
districts.
furthermore
which
is
even
more
critical,
there
is
an
overlapping
of
jurisdictions,
i
like
to
refer
this
to
this
as
a
federation.
a
junior
college
district
is
a
federation,
that's
not
strictly
true
but
i
think
it
reflects
the
essence
of
component
public
school
districts
joined
together
in
forming
a
junior
college
district
which
has
taken
over
a
particular
function
that
was
formally
operated
by
the
public
school
district
that
is
of
13th
and
14th
year
of
education.
i
think
the
component
system
is
justified
by
the
history
of
junior
college
education
in
missouri
which
has
been
touched
on
already
here.
it
is
formally
--
this
was
handled
by
each
public
school
district
itself
and
they
have
given
up
a
part
of
their
function
to
chart
it
over
to
the
junior
college
district.
moreover
they
may,
even
under
present
laws
still
continue
to
operate
junior
colleges
each
public
school
district.
furthermore
the
method
of
organization
manifest
this
federation,
this
simply
was
already
been
discussed
adequately
and
i'll
pass
on
to
the
next
point.
the
system
of
component
districts
also
promotes
organization
and
i
think
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
important
things
as
reflected
by
the
statistics
that
mr.
burrell
cited
that
enrollment
has
gone
from
6
to
about
30,000
students.
the
curriculum
offerings,
i
don't
have
any
statistics
but
i
know
from
representing
the
state
board
of
education
have
developed
greatly
by
this
method
of
providing
junior
college
education.
next,
i
would
like
to
point
as
a
justification
for
the
component
district
system
that
the
component
school
district
is
an
established
community
of
interest.
it
is
not
an
arbitrary
election
district
or
that
it
is
setup
only
for
the
purpose
of
election.
the
component
school
district
is
a
public
school
district
that
educates
children
from
5
years
to
16
years,
from
kindergarten
through
senior
year
of
high
school.
the
people
in
that
district
are
accustomed
to
joining
in
a
concern
for
education.
they
are
concerned
about
their
high
school
graduates.
they
have
developed
communication
channels
for
the
purpose
of
providing
education
in
that
area.
therefore
it
is
almost
a
natural
society,
a
natural
unit
to
be
represented
in
the
junior
college
district
and
under
the
present
method
they
can
elect
a
trustee
that
reflects
this
community
of
interest.
furthermore,
the
component
school
district
system
facilitates
the
administration
of
education.
school
district
boundary
lines
change
very
rapidly,
much
more
rapidly
than
municipality
boundary
lines.
school
districts
can
change
their
boundaries
in
missouri
by
annexation,
by
consolidation,
by
boundary
change
elections
by
reorganization
and
this
occur
almost
daily
throughout
the
state.
under
the
present
component
district
system,
the
boundaries
of
the
school
district
and
this
component
districts
change
simultaneously,
they
are
always
coincident.
furthermore
there
is
economics
and
facility
administration
in
holding
elections.
under
the
present
component
district
system,
junior
college
district
trustees
are
elected
at
the
same
time
as
public
school
trustees,
the
component
district
trustees
thus
you
avoid
the
necessity
of
two
elections.
now,
if
we
had
equally
divided
election
districts
rather
than
components,
it
would
be
necessary
in
many
years
to
have
separate
elections
for
trustees
because
there's
a
difference
between
the
time
of
election
of
different
component
school
districts.
furthermore,
since
both
of
these
agencies,
the
component
and
the
junior
college
are
supervised
by
the
state
board
of
education
in
curriculum
and
other
matters.
this
facilitates
the
state
administration
of
education
in
preserving
the
component
district
system.
i
think
also
the
component
district
system
is
valuable
because
these
trustees
directly
responsible
to
a
smaller
area.
it
is
the
decentralization
argument
that
is
presented
to
you
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
york.
also,
it
facilitates
the
urban,
suburban,
rural
alliance
which
has
already
been
discussed
i
believe
in
length
here.
i
would
like
to
move
to
my
second
point
that
is,
that
a
junior
college
district,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
a
general
governing
body
as
is
discussed
in
the
avery
case.
counties,
cities
which
have
been
held
under
the
equal
protection,
one
man,
one
vote
rule,
--
excuse
me,
have
quasi
sovereignty.
they
have
clearly
identifiable
units
which
reflect
the
three
branches
of
our
angle-saxon
government,
executive,
legislative
and
judicial.
they
make
laws.
they
enforce
laws.
they
adjudicate
them.
furthermore,
and
i
think
is
very
critical
here,
general
governing
bodies,
cities
and
counties
have
the
police
power.
they
license
professions.
they
regulate
businesses.
they
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
general
public.
they
provide
for
general
health.
they
provide
for
general
welfare.
they
also
provide
numerous
common
services
like
police
protection
and
fire
protection.
none
of
these
things
does
the
junior
college,
the
district
of
metropolitan,
kansas
city
did.
they're
in
business
for
one
purpose
and
there
is
education.
i
think
the
junior
college
district
of
kansas
city
is
much
more
comparable
to
a
private
incorporated
college
than
it
is
to
a
general
governing
body.
if
we
look
at
the
enumerated
powers
that
mr.
achtenberg
mentioned
to
the
court
earlier,
the
junior
college
district
can
sue
so
can
a
private
college.
the
junior
college
district
can
issue
bonds,
so
can
a
private
corporation.
the
junior
college
districts
employs
these
teachers
and
other
persons,
so
does
a
private
college.
junior
college
districts
hold
title
and
control
property,
so
does
a
private
college.
junior
college
district
governs
pupils,
so
does
a
private
college.
there
are
only
two
distinctions
that
i
am
able
to
find,
the
first
is
that
the
junior
college
district
can
tax
and
private
colleges
do
not
a
taxing
power.
but
i
would
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
so
far
as
taxing
powers?
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
well,
my
first
premise
would
be
that
the
rule
does
not
apply
to
the
normal
public
school
district
but
going
directly
to
your
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
yes.
i
think
this
is
the
same
thing
that
i
--
these
powers
have
enumerated
are
as
the
same
with
a
public
school
district.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
yes.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
in
the
sense
that
it
cannot
be
at
arbitrary
with
themselves.
they
must
have
been
on
the
electric
(voice
overlap)
before.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
in
normal
circumstances,
unless
there
is
a
referendum
or
something
like
that.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
originally
when
they
organize,
the
voters
authorize
ten
cents.
now,
if
they
want
to
exceed
that,
they
have
to
hold
an
election,
the
missouri
constitution
provides
that
you
--
if
you
get
a
certain
percentage
of
the
vote,
its
good
for
up
to
i
think
four
years
if
you
just
get
a
--
simple
majority
is
only
good
for
one
year
so
you
have
to
go
back
every
year
for
an
additional
amount.
i
would
further
add
that
a
private
college
has
almost
the
same
powers
and
that
they
are
often
--
receive
the
benefit
of
federal
lands,
state
--
governmental
moneys
through
assistance.
and
the
only
other
power
that
i
can
find
that
is
somewhat
different
is
that
a
junior
college
district
can
condemn
property.
but
this
is
true
also
of
many
quasi
public
corporations,
public
utilities,
railroads,
telephone
companies,
etcetera.
so,
basically
i
find
the
junior
college
district
much
more
akin
to
a
private
incorporated
college
than
it
is
to
a
city
or
county
or
other
generally
--
general
governing
body.
therefore,
i
would
conclude
to
say
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
include
this
junior
college
district.
that
it
is
not
a
general
governing
body
as
the
term
has
been
--
as
i
understand
the
term
as
expressed
in
the
court's
present
opinions.
but
further
that
missouri
and
other
states
should
have
the
flexibility
to
innovate,
to
experiment,
to
find
methods
of
education
that
are
tailored
to
the
local
need
in
the
local
circumstances
and
this
is
what
the
component
system
is.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
c.

i

mr.

yes

in

this

and
the

that

in

which
is
even

there
is
an
overlapping
of
jurisdictions,
i
like
to
refer

to

that's

education
in
curriculum
and
other
matters.
this
facilitates
the
state
administration
of
education
in
preserving
the
component
district
system.
i
think
also
the
component
district
system
is
valuable
because
these
trustees
directly
responsible
to
a
smaller
area.
it
is
the
decentralization
argument
that
is
presented
to
you
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
york.
also,
it
facilitates
the
urban,
suburban,
rural
alliance
which
has
already
been
discussed
i
believe
in
length
here.
i
would
like
to
move
to
my
second
point
that
is,
that
a
junior
college
district,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
a
general
governing
body
as
is
discussed
in
the
avery
case.
counties,
cities
which
have
been
held
under
the
equal
protection,
one
man,
one
vote
rule,
--
excuse
me,
have
quasi
sovereignty.
they
have
clearly
identifiable
units
which
reflect
the
three
branches
of
our
angle-saxon
government,
executive,
legislative
and
judicial.
they
make
laws.
they
enforce
laws.
they
adjudicate
them.
furthermore,
and
i
think
is
very
critical
here,
general
governing
bodies,
cities
and
counties
have
the
police
power.
they
license
professions.
they
regulate
businesses.
they
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
general
public.
they
provide
for
general
health.
they
provide
for
general
welfare.
they
also
provide
numerous
common
services
like
police
protection
and
fire
protection.
none
of
these
things
does
the
junior
college,
the
district
of
metropolitan,
kansas
city
did.
they're
in
business
for
one
purpose
and
there
is
education.
i
think
the
junior
college
district
of
kansas
city
is
much
more
comparable
to
a
private
incorporated
college
than
it
is
to
a
general
governing
body.
if
we
look
at
the
enumerated
powers
that
mr.
achtenberg
mentioned
to
the
court
earlier,
the
junior
college
district
can
sue
so
can
a
private
college.
the
junior
college
district
can
issue
bonds,
so
can
a
private
corporation.
the
junior
college
districts
employs
these
teachers
and
other
persons,
so
does
a
private
college.
junior
college
districts
hold
title
and
control
property,
so
does
a
private
college.
junior
college
district
governs
pupils,
so
does
a
private
college.
there
are
only
two
distinctions
that
i
am
able
to
find,
the
first
is
that
the
junior
college
district
can
tax
and
private
colleges
do
not
a
taxing
power.
but
i
would
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
so
far
as
taxing
powers?
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
well,
my
first
premise
would
be
that
the
rule
does
not
apply
to
the
normal
public
school
district
but
going
directly
to
your
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
yes.
i
think
this
is
the
same
thing
that
i
--
these
powers
have
enumerated
are
as
the
same
with
a
public
school
district.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
yes.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
in
the
sense
that
it
cannot
be
at
arbitrary
with
themselves.
they
must
have
been
on
the
electric
(voice
overlap)
before.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
in
normal
circumstances,
unless
there
is
a
referendum
or
something
like
that.
mr.
louis
c.
defeo,
jr.
originally
when
they
organize,
the
voters
authorize
ten
cents.
now,
if
they
want
to
exceed
that,
they
have
to
hold
an
election,
the
missouri
constitution
provides
that
you
--
if
you
get
a
certain
percentage
of
the
vote,
its
good
for
up
to
i
think
four
years
if
you
just
get
a
--
simple
majority
is
only
good
for
one
year
so
you
have
to
go
back
every
year
for
an
additional
amount.
i
would
further
add
that
a
private
college
has
almost
the
same
powers
and
that
they
are
often
--
receive
the
benefit
of
federal
lands,
state
--
governmental
moneys
through
assistance.
and
the
only
other
power
that
i
can
find
that
is
somewhat
different
is
that
a
junior
college
district
can
condemn
property.
but
this
is
true
also
of
many
quasi
public
corporations,
public
utilities,
railroads,
telephone
companies,
etcetera.
so,
basically
i
find
the
junior
college
district
much
more
akin
to
a
private
incorporated
college
than
it
is
to
a
city
or
county
or
other
generally
--
general
governing
body.
therefore,
i
would
conclude
to
say
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
include
this
junior
college
district.
that
it
is
not
a
general
governing
body
as
the
term
has
been
--
as
i
understand
the
term
as
expressed
in
the
court's
present
opinions.
but
further
that
missouri
and
other
states
should
have
the
flexibility
to
innovate,
to
experiment,
to
find
methods
of
education
that
are
tailored
to
the
local
need
in
the
local
circumstances
and
this
is
what
the
component
system
is.
thank
you.
