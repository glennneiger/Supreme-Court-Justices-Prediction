how
would
you
give
them
what
they
deserve?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
qualifications
of
teachers?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
board
doesn't
prescribe
the
curriculum
and
qualification?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
something
in
the
nature
of
running
a
school
or
junior
college
district
which
would
indicate
that,
say
10,000
people
in
school
district
a
only
have
a
certain
vote
in
the
junior
college
but
10,000
people
in
another
district
should
only
have
half
that
much
influence
in
the
running
of
the
junior
college.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
--
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
the
allocating
the
board
in
a
way
that
it
--
that
the
statute
allocates?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
when,
yeah?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
--
i
take
it
that
at
some
point
in
that
progression,
the
same
number
of
people
in
kansas
city
won't
have
as
much
influence
in
running
the
junior
college
as
the
same
number
of
people
in
the
inter
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
--
i'm
not
saying
that's
invidious,
i'm
just
saying
that's
the
fact
though
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
there's
really
nothing
but
just
sort
of
an
arithmetic
necessity
to
do
it
this
way
rather
than
--
you
don't
feel
that
there's
anything
inherent
in
running
this
school
district
that
requires
this
kind
of
malapportionment,
if
i
could
call
it
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
will
call
it,
would
you
say
this
particular
method
is
distributing
governing
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
you
think
this
form
--
this
kind
of
a
formula
is
required
or
that
it
required
to
achieve
a
junior
college
district
or
that
it
makes
it
more
likely
that
there
will
be
junior
college
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
trustee,
more
than
their
population
would
entitle
them
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
dusch
against
davis?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
a
formula
for
giving
smaller
districts
a
guarantee
in
smaller
districts
representation
either
of
their
population
doesn't
necessarily
warranted.
and
it
was
--
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
decision
was
to
enable
what
was
to
facilitate
consolidation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
i
suppose
you
could
if
a
--
even
though
all
the
trustees
were
elected
at
large
there
could
be
residence
qualifications
put
on
one,
two
or
three
of
them.
justice
byron

you.
