mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
this
case
originated
in
the
trial
court
in
missouri
by
a
petition
filed
by
residents
in
a
junior
college
district
to
a
state
junior
college
district
in
two
counts.
the
first
count,
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
question
the
right
of
the
trustees
of
the
junior
college
to
locate
a
college
site
in
a
suburban
area
rather
than
locating
it
closer
to
the
center
of
population
of
the
community.
in
the
second
count
and
the
only
count
which
is
before
this
court,
the
plaintiffs
raised
the
question
of
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
the
missouri
statutory
formula
for
selection
of
junior
college
trustees.
the
trial
court
dismissed
most
counts
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action;
plaintiffs
dismissed
their
count
with
regard
to
site
location
and
took
the
appeal
to
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
the
constitutional
question
raised
as
to
trustee
selection.
the
missouri
supreme
court
sustained
the
trial
court
citing
the
sailors
case
of
this
court
as
support
for
its
position
in
distinguishing
the
case
from
the
avery
case
decided
by
this
court.
the
plaintiffs
have
appealed
to
this
court.
the
issue
is
a
relatively
simple
one
and
it
is
thus
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine
an
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevent
or
is
it
violated
by
the
missouri
peculiar
statutory
provision
for
the
selection
of
state
junior
college
trustees
from
election
districts
within
the
junior
college
district.
if
i
may,
i
think
the
issue
might
be
broken
into
two
sub-issues.
first
of
all,
does
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine
apply
to
school
districts
such
as
the
one
here.
secondly,
if
as
the
appellants
met
the
doctrine
does
apply,
then
thus
the
missouri
statutory
provision
constitute
invidious
discrimination
and
is
it
violative
of
the
principle.
the
appellants
believe
that
that
--
believe
that
the
doctrine
does
apply
and
we
believe
that
the
missouri
statutory
provisions
not
only
permit
but
in
fact
compel
by
statutory
formula
that
there'd
be
invidious
discrimination
by
residents
of
voters
and
that
that
discrimination
is
directed
in
only
one
direction
and
favors
the
suburban
or
the
small
component
school
district
voters
as
against
the
voters
in
the
large
central
city
district.
the
facts
are
presented
or
rather
the
facts
present
the
issue
with
almost
(inaudible)
simplicity.
under
missouri
statutes,
a
junior
college
district
may
be
formed
by
the
voters
of
a
group
of
adjacent
school
districts
simply
by
their
majority
vote.
they
may
form
a
junior
college,
a
state
junior
college
district
which
then
has
as
its
boundaries
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
component
school
districts.
now
at
this
point,
the
school
districts
as
such
cease
to
have
any
role
to
play
in
the
functioning
of
the
junior
college
district.
by
the
formula,
they
simply
become
election
districts
thereafter
for
the
election
of
junior
college
districts
and
of
course
the
junior
college
boundaries
are
co-terminus
with
the
boundaries
of
the
school
districts.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
suppose
mr.
justice
that
it
occurs
at
most
citizen
action
occurs,
i
suppose
groups
get
together
and
talk
to
their
legislators
or
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
or
rather
in
this
case
a
petition
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
the
--
it's
by
a
petition
and
then
by
a
vote
of
the
people.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
statute
provides
and
i'll
read
it
whenever
a
petition
is
signed
by
voters
in
each
component
school
district
within
a
proposed
junior
college
district
equal
number
to
5%
of
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
the
direct
to
receiving
the
greatest
number
of
votes
within
each
component
school
district
at
the
last
proceeding
school
action,
in
each
school
district
at
which
a
director
was
elected
is
presented
to
the
state
board
of
education
praying
the
junior
college
district
be
organized
for
the
purpose
of
offering
junior
college,
13th
and
14th
year
courses.
and
the
state
board
of
education
determines
that
the
area
proposed
to
be
included
within
the
districts
meets
the
standards
established
by
it
under
the
provision
of
sections
178,
770,
the
890
each
or
an
election
held
with
the
proposed
--
within
the
proposed
district,
to
vote
under
the
proposed
to
elect
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
would
be
simply
citizen
action
by
voluntary
citizen's
groups
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
who
simply
get
together
and
decide
that
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
the
community
to
have
a
state
junior
college
district
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
that's
the
assumption
which
i
think
is
made
in
the
appellee's
brief,
we
deny
it.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
it
is
equally
arguable
that
the
advantages
of
the
district
or
is
advantageous
to
all
the
members
who
come
in
that
they
should
come
in
on
an
equal
basis.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
statutory
or
community
history
which
indicates
that
the
persuasion
was
made
to
the
suburban
districts
that
they
would
get
a
weighted
vote
by
coming
in
or
that
the
people
within
the
inner
city
who
have
said,
“we
are
told
that
you
will
not
get
a
weighted
vote.”
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
statute
certainly
does
provide
a
weighted
vote.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
can
only
say
that
i
know
of
no
factual
history
background
to
support
this
and
i
would
argue
that
if
there
is
such
a
background,
it
is
no
more
constitutionally
permissible
then
perhaps
the
historical
development
of
the
one
legislator
per
county
which
this
court
struck
down
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
about
six
years.
the
kansas
city
(voice
overlap)
district
was
formed
in
about
'64.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
then
having
formed
the
college
district,
we
are
now
concerned
with
the
statutory
provision
by
which
the
trustees
are
elected
and
that
is
by
uniquely
missouri
formula
which
deals
not
with
population
but
what
is
quote
in
missouri
statutes,
school
enumeration.
in
school
enumeration
by
statute
is
simply
the
annual
enumeration
in
a
school
district
of
those
persons
from
the
ages
of
six
to
20.
and
i
presume
that
the
purpose
--
well,
first
of
all,
the
purpose
for
this
enumeration
is
for
allocation
of
funds
to
school
districts.
and
i
assume
that
the
purpose
for
using
enumeration
in
terms
of
the
election
structure
in
junior
college
district
is
that
it
is
a
figure
which
is
providable
in
each
school
district
whereas
population
figures
might
not
be
broken
down
by
a
school
district.
but
in
any
event,
the
statute
does
provide
that
where
that
--
first
of
all,
the
general
provision
is
that
election
of
junior
college
trustee
shall
be
at
large
with
the
exception
however
that
if
in
that
junior
college
district
there
is
what
we
would
call
a
component
school
district
having
a
school
enumeration
of
more
than
one
third
or
less
than
50%
of
the
total
school
enumeration
of
the
junior
college
district,
then
the
voters
of
that
component
school
district
shall
have
one
third.
and
since
there
are
six
trustees
provided
by
law,
they
will
have
two
of
the
six
trustees.
and
in
any
district
where
a
component
school
district
has
half
to
two-thirds
of
the
enumeration
of
the
total
district,
then
the
voters
of
that
district
shall
vote
for
three
of
the
six
trustees
and
in
the
third
bracket
to
the
formula
if
any
component
school
district
has
from
two-thirds
upwards
of
the
entire
junior
college
district
then
it
shall
have
two-thirds
or
four.
now,
in
each
case,
the
remainder
of
the
trustees
are
not
elected
by
the
other
component
school
district
but
by
what
i
would
call
an
election
district
formed
of
all
the
remaining
school
districts
within
the
junior
college
district.
so
what
we
have
is
that
the
large
district
traditionally
and
in
fact
normally
the
central
city
district
becomes
one
election
district
and
the
grouping
of
the
small
satellite
or
suburban
school
districts
become
another
election
district
whether
they
be
more
or
less
in
fact
than
the
total
of
the
central
school
district.
now,
of
course
the
central
district
would
have
only
a
third
so
that
although
the
formula
by
automatic
effect
is
weighted
in
favor
of
the
suburban
districts,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
suburban
districts
actually
have
a
greater
majority
of
the
total
school
situation
or
the
school
enumeration
than
the
central
city
district.
as
you
make
it
clear
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
limited
vote,
all
voters
throughout
the
entire
district
vote
and
the
school
boards
themselves
have
no
role
whatsoever
to
play
once
the
district
is
formed
in
the
operation
or
the
functioning
of
the
junior
college
district.
now,
how
does
it
work
in
practice?
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
appendix,
since
this
formation
the
kansas
city
school
district
has
had
from
59
and
a
half
to
63
and
a
half
percent
of
the
total
enumeration
of
the
junior
college
district
of
greater
kansas
city.
and
yet
during
that
period
by
the
formula,
it
has
always
had
only
half
or
three
of
the
six
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
the
statute
if
the
court
invalidates
simply
the
sub-district
or
component
district
formula,
the
trustees
under
the
remaining
portion
of
the
statute
may
be
elected
at
large.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
has
not
been
historically
true.
i
think
that
that
when
the
community
works
as
a
group,
subordinate
groups
have
their
voice
heard.
the
city
is
not
homogenous.
on
the
issue
for
example
of
minority
rights,
the
poverty
program,
the
blacks
in
the
inner
city.
there
are
many
people
within
the
city
itself
that
are
against
what
i
would
think
of
as
progressive
schools
so
that
the
city,
the
central
city
is
not
homogenous.
and
in
producing
this
elective
or
voters
result,
there
are
many
small
divergent
groups
which
work
together.
and
it's
the
process
in
at
large
election
by
which
different
groups
are
represented
and
i
could
illustrate
that
very
easily
in
kansas
city
where
our
city
council
is
elected
in
part
at
large.
the
negro
population
of
kansas
city
which
is
far
less
than
half
has
one
negro
councilman
at
large
not
because
of
their
power
of
their
vote
as
a
majority
but
because
as
a
minority,
they
can
exercise
a
voice
which
is
heard
in
the
combined
elective
process.
i
think
the
same
process
would
work
here.
however,
we
are
not
i
--
and
this
court
is
not
committed
to
telling
the
state
of
missouri
that
it
must
leave
the
statute
so
that
these
trustees
are
elected
at
large.
the
legislature
of
missouri
has
the
right
to
rewrite
this
law
and
to
set
up
election
districts
and
there
are
certainly
arguments
for
election
districts
so
that
if
there
are
area
of
view
points
so
as
view
points
may
be
represented.
always
say
is,
if
such
sub-election
districts
are
established
that
they
be
equal
in
population
so
that
one
group
in
one
area
does
not
have
a
greater
weight
in
proportion
to
his
population
than
does
the
group
in
another
area.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
for
purposes
of
our
discussion
and
throughout
this
case,
we
have
considered
that
school
enumeration
being
a
segment
of
the
population
is
proportionate
to
population.
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
statistics
have
not
been
assembled
in
an
--
any
encyclopedic
way
but
basically
the
six
to
20
population
would
tend
to
follow
the
general
population.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
do
sir.
we
say
simply
that
if
the
court
proceeds
on
the
premise
which
we've
believed
to
be
a
fact
that
school
enumeration
is
proportionate,
then
we
are
simply
establishing
a
formula
for
population.
and
then
the
discriminatory
formula
of
the
bracketing
moving
in
one
direction
makes
it
an
improper
population
formula.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
appellees
argue
that
enumeration
is
not
proportionate
to
population
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
any
such
position,
but
if
they
are
to
argue
that
this
is
a
different
method
of
calculation
then
its
our
position
that
there
is
no
--
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
the
special
group
that
votes,
the
six
to
20
year
old
is
not
a
limited
electorate
such
as
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
kramer,
the
entire
population
votes.
it
simply
would
then
be
an
argument
that
that
area
which
has
a
different
ratio
of
six
to
20
year
olds,
all
the
voters
in
that
area
should
have
a
specially
weighted
vote
and
we
argue
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
say
expanding
the
facts
in
missouri
beyond
the
kansas
city
school,
the
junior
college
district
that
the
same
thing
has
happened
throughout
the
state.
there
are
nine
state
junior
college
districts,
three
of
them
do
not
have
any
district
in
which
the
fraction
of
formula
applies
so
their
trustees
are
elected
at
large.
and
the
remaining
six
districts
where
the
situation
does
pertain,
we
find
that
in
five
of
the
six,
the
discriminatory
formula
has
operated
so
that
in
the
statistics
in
our
brief,
we
show
that
in
five
out
of
the
six,
the
discrimination
proceeds
to
the
cause,
to
the
extreme
range
of
the
violation.
so
that
what
we
have
is
that
in
five
out
of
the
six,
the
weighting
of
the
vote
is
from
one
and
a
half
to
one
to
two
to
one
against
the
large
component
school
district.
now,
i'd
like
to
summarize
very
quickly
the
functions
of
a
junior
college
under
missouri
law.
it
may
sue
and
be
sued.
it
may
levy
and
collect
taxes
and
may
issue
bonds,
if
they
exercise
the
corporate
powers
of
other
school
districts,
provide
instructions,
set
these,
conduct
hearings
on
disciplinary
charges,
make
rules
and
regulations
for
its
organization
in
the
governing
of
the
district,
let
contracts,
employ
and
discharge
teachers,
approve
bills,
appoint
employees
and
define
their
duties
and
compensation
as
on
the
annexation
of
additional
school
districts
to
the
junior
college
district,
acquire
property
of
a
condemnation,
hold
a
title
to
the
property
of
the
district,
provide
for
its
maintenance
and
make
rules
and
govern
the
schooling
of
its
students.
now,
as
to
the
decisional
developments
of
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine,
to
the
point
where
we
believe,
it
applies
in
this
situation.
this
court
first
applied
the
doctrine
in
reynolds
versus
sims
to
state
legislatures
and
in
wesberry
versus
sanders,
that
extended
the
doctrine
or
applied
it
to
congressional
districts.
and
then
in
avery,
it
extended
it
to
courts
or
governing
bodies
of
counties
and
certainly
in
the
language
of
that
decision
by
justice
white,
the
concept
of
local
governments
included
not
only
counties
but
city
councils
and
school
boards.
this
court
had
not
directly
faced
the
problem
in
a
school
district.
other
courts
have
however.
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
meyer
versus
board
of
education
held
that
the
doctrine
did
apply.
tennessee
district
court,
strickland
versus
burns
found
it
applicable
and
in
delozier
versus
tyrone
school
board,
the
federal
district
court
in
pennsylvania
applied
the
doctrine.
other
courts
have
also
applied
the
doctrine
to
cities.
in
fact
the
missouri
supreme
court
itself
applied
it
to
a
city
council
of
a
city
of
about
500
--
5,000
population,
something
less
perhaps
than
the
student
population
of
this
junior
college
in
armentrout
versus
schooler.
the
fourth
circuit
in
ellis
versus
baltimore,
or
city
council
of
baltimore
applied
this
doctrine
to
a
city
council.
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
principle
which
is
enunciated
by
these
cases
is
that
where
a
governmental
agency
making
substantial
governmental
decisions
is
elected
by
vote
of
the
general
electorate,
each
men's
vote
must
be
weighted
equally
and
as
a
corp
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
wesberry
was
versed
on
--
was
based
on
article
1
but
it
seems
that
--
seems
to
me
that
whether
we're
relying
on
that
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
constitutional
concept
of
the
voter's
rights
and
the
equality
of
voter's
rights
is
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so
although
this
court
has
seem
to
place
the
congressional
districting
on
article
1
and
the
legislative
districting
and
county
districting
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
seems
to
me
that
the
underlying
democratic
constitutional
principle
is
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
in
both
of
those
clauses.
and
i
suppose
the
--
in
the
federalist
papers
and
the
constitution
proceedings
of
the
constitutional
convention
with
which
i
won't
quarrel
to
this
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
that
requires
me
to
express
my
opinion.
it
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
--
i
think
i
can
answer
it
this
way
on
the
record,
this
suit
was
brought
by
voters
in
the
central
city
district
or
the
kansas
city
school
district
portion
of
the
junior
college
district
in
two
counts.
and
the
first
count
sought
to
resist
the
decision
of
the
board
of
trustees
to
locate
the
first
junior
college
campus
in
the
suburbs
rather
than
in
the
central
city.
and
i
would
say
that
implicit
in
the
litigation
is
the
conflict
perhaps
between
the
people
who
moved
to
the
suburbs
and
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so,
yes
sir
and
the
existing
conflict
which
confronts
our
school
systems
today.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
no.
the
--
what
we
call
three
and
six
direct
or
school
districts
which
include
most
of
the
grade
and
high
school
and
the
consolidated
districts,
those
call
for
election
by
the
general
electorate.
the
only
trustees
in
our
missouri
system
which
are
not
elected
are
the
trustees
of
the
state
university
and
state
college
which
are
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
appointment
by
the
governor.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
mr.
justice
you
asked
me
a
question
which
i
think
is
not
encompassed
within
the
issues
in
this
case
and
again
its
my
opinion
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
yet
faced
that
question.
there
were
some
suggestion
in
sailors
that
or
more
than
a
suggestion
that
the
county
board
of
education
there
was
such
a
governmental
agency
that
appointment
was
acceptable
because
this
court
based
its
decision
on
that
case
and
the
fact
that
the
selection
of
the
trustees
of
the
county
board
by
appointment
from
the
boards
of
the
school
districts
within
the
county
was
an
appointment
process
--
i
questioned
whether
an
operating
school
district
at
the
local
level
would
--
i
question
from
a
democratic
process,
standpoint
whether
it
be
desirable
that
they
be
appointed.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
don't
know.
this
court
has
not
given
me
any
guidance
on
that
point
and
i
don't
think
it's
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
certainly
in
the
sailors
case,
this
court
said
that
by
its
decision
that
the
--
in
a
different
type
of
a
school
district,
a
county
board
of
education
that
the
appointive
process
was
acceptable.
now
i
see
great
differences
between
a
county
board
of
education
where
there
are
--
the
local
area
school
boards
or
boards
of
education
and
the
situation
here,
the
county
boards
of
educations
or
a
rather
atrophied
in
--
and
the
vestigial
type
of
a
governmental
agency
in
many
cases
they
are
being
abolished.
they
are
not
districts
which
operate
school
systems.
and
i
think
really
mr.
justice
you're
presenting
the
question
of
the
legislative
versus
administrative
question
which
has
been
presented
in
several
of
this
cases.
and
it
seems
to
be,
it
may
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
where
there
is
a
law
requiring
or
providing
for
appointment
if
it
were
to
be
challenged,
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
basis
of,
“is
there
a
substantial
governmental
function
here
which
requires
election
by
the
people?”
i
do
not
think
it's
in
anyway
presented
in
this
case
because
the
statute
in
the
determination
of
the
legislature
of
missouri,
was
this
be
an
elective
process.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
and
i
simply
say
that
we're
not
faced
the
decision
in
this
case
as
to
deciding
whether
or
not
this
should
be
an
appointive
or
an
elective
office.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir,
you're
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
is
true.
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
on
the
question
of
substantial
government
function.
the
appellees
speak
of
school
districts
in
the
context
of
special
districts.
we
submit
that
that
language
is
a
little
meaningless
and
in
any
event
a
school
district
is
much
closer
to
a
city
council
or
a
county
government
than
to
the
traditional
concept
of
a
special
district.
i
would
prefer
to
call
them
special
youth
districts,
special
assessment
districts
or
special
benefit
districts.
they
have
normally
three
characteristics.
first
of
all,
they
specifically
affect
one
area
of
the
community.
the
water
district,
the
sewer
district,
the
levy
district
affects
the
property
owners
directly
who
are
protected
by
that
improvement.
secondly,
normally
the
assessment,
the
taxing
for
that
improvement
is
against
that
special
benefited
group.
and
thirdly,
it
is
common
for
that
specially
benefited
and
specially
taxed
group
to
have
the
right
to
be
the
special
electorate.
now,
not
one
of
these
criteria
exists
in
terms
of
a
school
district.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
our
traditional
concepts
of
the
american
public
school
system,
all
the
people
of
the
community
are
benefited
by
the
existence
of
public
schools.
second
of
all,
by
missouri
law,
all
the
citizens
of
the
community
are
taxed
for
the
schools
either
by
the
real
property
tax
or
through
the
personal
property
tax
or
to
some
extent
by
the
state
income
tax.
and
thirdly,
we
have
a
general
electorate,
so
that
none
of
the
criteria
of
the
special
district
apply.
in
terms
of
function,
i
think
it
equally
significant
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
narrow
function
of
a
special
youth
district.
the
sewer
district,
you
run
a
sewer,
the
water
district,
you
want
to
walk
or
you
run
a
water
line,
it's
a
one
step
operation
and
from
then
on,
the
function
of
that
board
whether
it
be
elected
or
appointed
is
simply
a
minor
matter
of
collection
of
angular
assessments
and
maintenance
of
the
improvement.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
complex
problems
presented
in
the
context
of
the
day's
educational
problems
by
our
school
systems.
if
the
court
please,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
to
some
side
it
extends
but
basically
the
school
boards
are
autonomous.
they
make
all
the
major
decisions.
there
are
prescribed
to
a
limited
extent
by
a
vote
of
the
people
in
terms
for
example
of
capital
improvements
or
changes
in
school
levies,
school
boards
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
curriculum
is
the
decision
of
the
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
as
my
understanding
that
the
state
board
of
education
is
in
a
sense
advisory,
our
state
laws
give
great
power
to
the
local
school
boards
except
for
the
familiar
exception
of
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
exercise
of
power.
but
other
than
that,
it
--
my
understanding
that
basically
the
state
board
is
advisory,
educational
in
aspect,
forward
thinking
in
terms
of
planning
but
it
is
not
a
step
in
a
governmental
structure.
it's
the
--
the
local
boards
run
their
schools.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
as
subject
to
a
vote
or
approval.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
vote
or
approve.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
refuse
to
accept
and
we
ask
this
court
not
to
accept
any
argument
which
says
that
people
living
in
the
suburbs
have
problems
different
in
regard
to
schools
whether
they
be
local
--
lower
level
schools
or
high
level
schools.
they
have
more
problems
than
do
the
people
in
the
cities
such
that
this
court
should
justify
a
mathematical
statutory
formula
which
guarantees
a
weighted
vote
in
favor
of
the
suburbs.
i'd
like
to
repeat
if
i
may
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
the
statutory
formula
with
which
we
are
dealing
in
effect
guarantees
the
small
component
district
voters,
a
weighted
vote.
the
only
situation,
purely
theoretical
in
which
the
vote
would
be
equal
would
be
if
the
large
component
school
district
has
exactly
one
third
or
exactly
50%
or
exactly
two
thirds.
the
minute
its
--
it
falls
to
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
exact
one
vote,
it
then
becomes
a
prejudicial
formula
which
moves
in
the
direction
of
prejudice
of
the
large
component
school
district.
because
you
start
with
the
third
and
if
you
have
exactly
a
third,
you
get
one
third
of
the
votes.
you're
from
one
third
to
a
half,
you
still
get
a
third.
you
must
proceed
to
the
exactitude
of
a
half
to
get
what
you're
entitled
to
as
half.
and
the
minute
you
pass
over
that
then
you
become
--
again
discriminated
against
until
you
reach
the
exact
mathematical
point
of
two
thirds.
now,
no
place
in
the
evidence
and
no
place
in
the
arguments
is
any
rational
distinction
given
for
the
need
to
have
such
a
weighted
voting
formula.
the
argument
is
made
and
it
was
heard
before
in
the
legislative
redistricting
cases
that
the
--
in
that
case,
it
was
the
rural
minority,
in
this
case,
it's
the
suburban
minority
needs
protection.
what
we
think
should
be
said
is
that
all
minorities
need
to
have
a
vote
in
proportion
to
their
voting
strength
and
we
say
that
this
formula
denies
that.
it
favors
one
group
whether
it
be
a
minority
or
in
some
situations
a
majority.
it
gives
that
one
group
a
vote
weighted
against
its
actual
population
strength.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
kansas
city
school
system
has
been
mentioned,
at
least
this
kansas
school
district,
the
component
district
involved
here.
and
it
now
has
a
formula
which
does
avoid
that
and
it's
relatively
simple.
it
elects
six
trustees
from
sub
districts
or
six
directors
as
they
call
it.
and
by
the
statute,
those
districts
must
be
of
equal
population
and
then
it
elects
three
at
large.
the
proposal
of
--
or
rather
the
formula
mentioned
by
justice
white
in
the
davis
versus
dusch
is
another
which
would
give
representation.
i
say
frankly
that
in
a
large
election
would
probably
do
the
same
thing
because
of
the
diverse
small
interest
group
reacting
in
terms
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i'm
simply
giving
several
alternatives
with
the
emotions
developed
in
school
district
problems.
i
think
--
if
we're
thinking
of
wisdom
whether
than
--
rather
than
constitutionality
that
perhaps
either
the
district
selection
from
equal
population
districts
or
the
davis
versus
dusch
formula
would
be
more
responsive
to
the
wishes
or
to
--
would
more
clearly
express
the
wishes
of
people
in
terms
of
school
problems.
i
think
it
should
be
clear
that
there
are
two
issues
not
presented
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
board
may
be
appointive
or
elective.
the
statute
and
the
legislature
have
decided
that
this
is
a
governmental
body
affecting
the
public
interest
to
the
point
they
felt
it
should
be
an
elective
board.
we
simply
don't
have
the
question
in
sailors.
secondly,
we
don't
have
the
question
of
a
limited
electorate
as
there
was
in
kramer
because
here,
again
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
have
a
vote
by
all
qualified
voters
in
the
entire
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
--
i'm
told
not.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
simply
by
petition
without
a
party
identification.
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
our
thinking
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
schools
and
in
that
context,
the
junior
college
has
the
same
powers
as
any
public
school
in
missouri.
it
has
three
campuses.
it
has
all
the
myriad
problems
confronting
schools
today
and
i
submit
that
schools
involve
more
tensions,
more
strife
and
more
controversy
than
the
county
court
involved
in
avery
versus
midland.
the
statistics
obligingly
furnished
by
the
solicitor
general
and
his
brief
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
school
boards
are
the
most
numerous
of
all
forms
of
local
government.
they're
over
21,000
school
districts
in
this
country
and
they
constitute
over
one
fourth
of
all
local
governmental
units
and
about
10%
of
those
elect
from
districts.
about
one
half
of
all
local
governmental
expenditures
go
for
education.
now,
these
are
quantitative
figures
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
qualitative
aspect,
the
qualitative
impact
of
school
operations,
of
public
school
operations
on
our
governmental
concerns.
and
in
that
respect
that
the
concerns
of
citizens
for
the
functioning
of
their
schools
is
clearly
a
matter
of
governmental
concern
in
which
each
voters
rights
should
be
weighed
as
every
other
voters.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
this
case
originated
in
the
trial
court
in
missouri
by
a
petition
filed
by
residents
in
a
junior
college
district
to
a
state
junior
college
district
in
two
counts.
the
first
count,
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
question
the
right
of
the
trustees
of
the
junior
college
to
locate
a
college
site
in
a
suburban
area
rather
than
locating
it
closer
to
the
center
of
population
of
the
community.
in
the
second
count
and
the
only
count
which
is
before
this
court,
the
plaintiffs
raised
the
question
of
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
the
missouri
statutory
formula
for
selection
of
junior
college
trustees.
the
trial
court
dismissed
most
counts
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action;
plaintiffs
dismissed
their
count
with
regard
to
site
location
and
took
the
appeal
to
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
the
constitutional
question
raised
as
to
trustee
selection.
the
missouri
supreme
court
sustained
the
trial
court
citing
the
sailors
case
of
this
court
as
support
for
its
position
in
distinguishing
the
case
from
the
avery
case
decided
by
this
court.
the
plaintiffs
have
appealed
to
this
court.
the
issue
is
a
relatively
simple
one
and
it
is
thus
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine
an
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevent
or
is
it
violated
by
the
missouri
peculiar
statutory
provision
for
the
selection
of
state
junior
college
trustees
from
election
districts
within
the
junior
college
district.
if
i
may,
i
think
the
issue
might
be
broken
into
two
sub-issues.
first
of
all,
does
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine
apply
to
school
districts
such
as
the
one
here.
secondly,
if
as
the
appellants
met
the
doctrine
does
apply,
then
thus
the
missouri
statutory
provision
constitute
invidious
discrimination
and
is
it
violative
of
the
principle.
the
appellants
believe
that
that
--
believe
that
the
doctrine
does
apply
and
we
believe
that
the
missouri
statutory
provisions
not
only
permit
but
in
fact
compel
by
statutory
formula
that
there'd
be
invidious
discrimination
by
residents
of
voters
and
that
that
discrimination
is
directed
in
only
one
direction
and
favors
the
suburban
or
the
small
component
school
district
voters
as
against
the
voters
in
the
large
central
city
district.
the
facts
are
presented
or
rather
the
facts
present
the
issue
with
almost
(inaudible)
simplicity.
under
missouri
statutes,
a
junior
college
district
may
be
formed
by
the
voters
of
a
group
of
adjacent
school
districts
simply
by
their
majority
vote.
they
may
form
a
junior
college,
a
state
junior
college
district
which
then
has
as
its
boundaries
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
component
school
districts.
now
at
this
point,
the
school
districts
as
such
cease
to
have
any
role
to
play
in
the
functioning
of
the
junior
college
district.
by
the
formula,
they
simply
become
election
districts
thereafter
for
the
election
of
junior
college
districts
and
of
course
the
junior
college
boundaries
are
co-terminus
with
the
boundaries
of
the
school
districts.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
suppose
mr.
justice
that
it
occurs
at
most
citizen
action
occurs,
i
suppose
groups
get
together
and
talk
to
their
legislators
or
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
or
rather
in
this
case
a
petition
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
the
--
it's
by
a
petition
and
then
by
a
vote
of
the
people.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
statute
provides
and
i'll
read
it
whenever
a
petition
is
signed
by
voters
in
each
component
school
district
within
a
proposed
junior
college
district
equal
number
to
5%
of
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
the
direct
to
receiving
the
greatest
number
of
votes
within
each
component
school
district
at
the
last
proceeding
school
action,
in
each
school
district
at
which
a
director
was
elected
is
presented
to
the
state
board
of
education
praying
the
junior
college
district
be
organized
for
the
purpose
of
offering
junior
college,
13th
and
14th
year
courses.
and
the
state
board
of
education
determines
that
the
area
proposed
to
be
included
within
the
districts
meets
the
standards
established
by
it
under
the
provision
of
sections
178,
770,
the
890
each
or
an
election
held
with
the
proposed
--
within
the
proposed
district,
to
vote
under
the
proposed
to
elect
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
does
not
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
would
be
simply
citizen
action
by
voluntary
citizen's
groups
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
who
simply
get
together
and
decide
that
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
the
community
to
have
a
state
junior
college
district
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
that's
the
assumption
which
i
think
is
made
in
the
appellee's
brief,
we
deny
it.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
it
is
equally
arguable
that
the
advantages
of
the
district
or
is
advantageous
to
all
the
members
who
come
in
that
they
should
come
in
on
an
equal
basis.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
statutory
or
community
history
which
indicates
that
the
persuasion
was
made
to
the
suburban
districts
that
they
would
get
a
weighted
vote
by
coming
in
or
that
the
people
within
the
inner
city
who
have
said,
“we
are
told
that
you
will
not
get
a
weighted
vote.”
it
seems
to
me
that
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
statute
certainly
does
provide
a
weighted
vote.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
can
only
say
that
i
know
of
no
factual
history
background
to
support
this
and
i
would
argue
that
if
there
is
such
a
background,
it
is
no
more
constitutionally
permissible
then
perhaps
the
historical
development
of
the
one
legislator
per
county
which
this
court
struck
down
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
about
six
years.
the
kansas
city
(voice
overlap)
district
was
formed
in
about
'64.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
then
having
formed
the
college
district,
we
are
now
concerned
with
the
statutory
provision
by
which
the
trustees
are
elected
and
that
is
by
uniquely
missouri
formula
which
deals
not
with
population
but
what
is
quote
in
missouri
statutes,
school
enumeration.
in
school
enumeration
by
statute
is
simply
the
annual
enumeration
in
a
school
district
of
those
persons
from
the
ages
of
six
to
20.
and
i
presume
that
the
purpose
--
well,
first
of
all,
the
purpose
for
this
enumeration
is
for
allocation
of
funds
to
school
districts.
and
i
assume
that
the
purpose
for
using
enumeration
in
terms
of
the
election
structure
in
junior
college
district
is
that
it
is
a
figure
which
is
providable
in
each
school
district
whereas
population
figures
might
not
be
broken
down
by
a
school
district.
but
in
any
event,
the
statute
does
provide
that
where
that
--
first
of
all,
the
general
provision
is
that
election
of
junior
college
trustee
shall
be
at
large
with
the
exception
however
that
if
in
that
junior
college
district
there
is
what
we
would
call
a
component
school
district
having
a
school
enumeration
of
more
than
one
third
or
less
than
50%
of
the
total
school
enumeration
of
the
junior
college
district,
then
the
voters
of
that
component
school
district
shall
have
one
third.
and
since
there
are
six
trustees
provided
by
law,
they
will
have
two
of
the
six
trustees.
and
in
any
district
where
a
component
school
district
has
half
to
two-thirds
of
the
enumeration
of
the
total
district,
then
the
voters
of
that
district
shall
vote
for
three
of
the
six
trustees
and
in
the
third
bracket
to
the
formula
if
any
component
school
district
has
from
two-thirds
upwards
of
the
entire
junior
college
district
then
it
shall
have
two-thirds
or
four.
now,
in
each
case,
the
remainder
of
the
trustees
are
not
elected
by
the
other
component
school
district
but
by
what
i
would
call
an
election
district
formed
of
all
the
remaining
school
districts
within
the
junior
college
district.
so
what
we
have
is
that
the
large
district
traditionally
and
in
fact
normally
the
central
city
district
becomes
one
election
district
and
the
grouping
of
the
small
satellite
or
suburban
school
districts
become
another
election
district
whether
they
be
more
or
less
in
fact
than
the
total
of
the
central
school
district.
now,
of
course
the
central
district
would
have
only
a
third
so
that
although
the
formula
by
automatic
effect
is
weighted
in
favor
of
the
suburban
districts,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
suburban
districts
actually
have
a
greater
majority
of
the
total
school
situation
or
the
school
enumeration
than
the
central
city
district.
as
you
make
it
clear
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
limited
vote,
all
voters
throughout
the
entire
district
vote
and
the
school
boards
themselves
have
no
role
whatsoever
to
play
once
the
district
is
formed
in
the
operation
or
the
functioning
of
the
junior
college
district.
now,
how
does
it
work
in
practice?
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
appendix,
since
this
formation
the
kansas
city
school
district
has
had
from
59
and
a
half
to
63
and
a
half
percent
of
the
total
enumeration
of
the
junior
college
district
of
greater
kansas
city.
and
yet
during
that
period
by
the
formula,
it
has
always
had
only
half
or
three
of
the
six
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
the
statute
if
the
court
invalidates
simply
the
sub-district
or
component
district
formula,
the
trustees
under
the
remaining
portion
of
the
statute
may
be
elected
at
large.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
has
not
been
historically
true.
i
think
that
that
when
the
community
works
as
a
group,
subordinate
groups
have
their
voice
heard.
the
city
is
not
homogenous.
on
the
issue
for
example
of
minority
rights,
the
poverty
program,
the
blacks
in
the
inner
city.
there
are
many
people
within
the
city
itself
that
are
against
what
i
would
think
of
as
progressive
schools
so
that
the
city,
the
central
city
is
not
homogenous.
and
in
producing
this
elective
or
voters
result,
there
are
many
small
divergent
groups
which
work
together.
and
it's
the
process
in
at
large
election
by
which
different
groups
are
represented
and
i
could
illustrate
that
very
easily
in
kansas
city
where
our
city
council
is
elected
in
part
at
large.
the
negro
population
of
kansas
city
which
is
far
less
than
half
has
one
negro
councilman
at
large
not
because
of
their
power
of
their
vote
as
a
majority
but
because
as
a
minority,
they
can
exercise
a
voice
which
is
heard
in
the
combined
elective
process.
i
think
the
same
process
would
work
here.
however,
we
are
not
i
--
and
this
court
is
not
committed
to
telling
the
state
of
missouri
that
it
must
leave
the
statute
so
that
these
trustees
are
elected
at
large.
the
legislature
of
missouri
has
the
right
to
rewrite
this
law
and
to
set
up
election
districts
and
there
are
certainly
arguments
for
election
districts
so
that
if
there
are
area
of
view
points
so
as
view
points
may
be
represented.
always
say
is,
if
such
sub-election
districts
are
established
that
they
be
equal
in
population
so
that
one
group
in
one
area
does
not
have
a
greater
weight
in
proportion
to
his
population
than
does
the
group
in
another
area.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
for
purposes
of
our
discussion
and
throughout
this
case,
we
have
considered
that
school
enumeration
being
a
segment
of
the
population
is
proportionate
to
population.
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
statistics
have
not
been
assembled
in
an
--
any
encyclopedic
way
but
basically
the
six
to
20
population
would
tend
to
follow
the
general
population.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
do
sir.
we
say
simply
that
if
the
court
proceeds
on
the
premise
which
we've
believed
to
be
a
fact
that
school
enumeration
is
proportionate,
then
we
are
simply
establishing
a
formula
for
population.
and
then
the
discriminatory
formula
of
the
bracketing
moving
in
one
direction
makes
it
an
improper
population
formula.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
appellees
argue
that
enumeration
is
not
proportionate
to
population
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
any
such
position,
but
if
they
are
to
argue
that
this
is
a
different
method
of
calculation
then
its
our
position
that
there
is
no
--
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
the
special
group
that
votes,
the
six
to
20
year
old
is
not
a
limited
electorate
such
as
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
kramer,
the
entire
population
votes.
it
simply
would
then
be
an
argument
that
that
area
which
has
a
different
ratio
of
six
to
20
year
olds,
all
the
voters
in
that
area
should
have
a
specially
weighted
vote
and
we
argue
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
say
expanding
the
facts
in
missouri
beyond
the
kansas
city
school,
the
junior
college
district
that
the
same
thing
has
happened
throughout
the
state.
there
are
nine
state
junior
college
districts,
three
of
them
do
not
have
any
district
in
which
the
fraction
of
formula
applies
so
their
trustees
are
elected
at
large.
and
the
remaining
six
districts
where
the
situation
does
pertain,
we
find
that
in
five
of
the
six,
the
discriminatory
formula
has
operated
so
that
in
the
statistics
in
our
brief,
we
show
that
in
five
out
of
the
six,
the
discrimination
proceeds
to
the
cause,
to
the
extreme
range
of
the
violation.
so
that
what
we
have
is
that
in
five
out
of
the
six,
the
weighting
of
the
vote
is
from
one
and
a
half
to
one
to
two
to
one
against
the
large
component
school
district.
now,
i'd
like
to
summarize
very
quickly
the
functions
of
a
junior
college
under
missouri
law.
it
may
sue
and
be
sued.
it
may
levy
and
collect
taxes
and
may
issue
bonds,
if
they
exercise
the
corporate
powers
of
other
school
districts,
provide
instructions,
set
these,
conduct
hearings
on
disciplinary
charges,
make
rules
and
regulations
for
its
organization
in
the
governing
of
the
district,
let
contracts,
employ
and
discharge
teachers,
approve
bills,
appoint
employees
and
define
their
duties
and
compensation
as
on
the
annexation
of
additional
school
districts
to
the
junior
college
district,
acquire
property
of
a
condemnation,
hold
a
title
to
the
property
of
the
district,
provide
for
its
maintenance
and
make
rules
and
govern
the
schooling
of
its
students.
now,
as
to
the
decisional
developments
of
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
doctrine,
to
the
point
where
we
believe,
it
applies
in
this
situation.
this
court
first
applied
the
doctrine
in
reynolds
versus
sims
to
state
legislatures
and
in
wesberry
versus
sanders,
that
extended
the
doctrine
or
applied
it
to
congressional
districts.
and
then
in
avery,
it
extended
it
to
courts
or
governing
bodies
of
counties
and
certainly
in
the
language
of
that
decision
by
justice
white,
the
concept
of
local
governments
included
not
only
counties
but
city
councils
and
school
boards.
this
court
had
not
directly
faced
the
problem
in
a
school
district.
other
courts
have
however.
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
meyer
versus
board
of
education
held
that
the
doctrine
did
apply.
tennessee
district
court,
strickland
versus
burns
found
it
applicable
and
in
delozier
versus
tyrone
school
board,
the
federal
district
court
in
pennsylvania
applied
the
doctrine.
other
courts
have
also
applied
the
doctrine
to
cities.
in
fact
the
missouri
supreme
court
itself
applied
it
to
a
city
council
of
a
city
of
about
500
--
5,000
population,
something
less
perhaps
than
the
student
population
of
this
junior
college
in
armentrout
versus
schooler.
the
fourth
circuit
in
ellis
versus
baltimore,
or
city
council
of
baltimore
applied
this
doctrine
to
a
city
council.
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
principle
which
is
enunciated
by
these
cases
is
that
where
a
governmental
agency
making
substantial
governmental
decisions
is
elected
by
vote
of
the
general
electorate,
each
men's
vote
must
be
weighted
equally
and
as
a
corp
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
wesberry
was
versed
on
--
was
based
on
article
1
but
it
seems
that
--
seems
to
me
that
whether
we're
relying
on
that
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
constitutional
concept
of
the
voter's
rights
and
the
equality
of
voter's
rights
is
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so
although
this
court
has
seem
to
place
the
congressional
districting
on
article
1
and
the
legislative
districting
and
county
districting
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
seems
to
me
that
the
underlying
democratic
constitutional
principle
is
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
in
both
of
those
clauses.
and
i
suppose
the
--
in
the
federalist
papers
and
the
constitution
proceedings
of
the
constitutional
convention
with
which
i
won't
quarrel
to
this
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
that
requires
me
to
express
my
opinion.
it
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
--
i
think
i
can
answer
it
this
way
on
the
record,
this
suit
was
brought
by
voters
in
the
central
city
district
or
the
kansas
city
school
district
portion
of
the
junior
college
district
in
two
counts.
and
the
first
count
sought
to
resist
the
decision
of
the
board
of
trustees
to
locate
the
first
junior
college
campus
in
the
suburbs
rather
than
in
the
central
city.
and
i
would
say
that
implicit
in
the
litigation
is
the
conflict
perhaps
between
the
people
who
moved
to
the
suburbs
and
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
so,
yes
sir
and
the
existing
conflict
which
confronts
our
school
systems
today.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
no.
the
--
what
we
call
three
and
six
direct
or
school
districts
which
include
most
of
the
grade
and
high
school
and
the
consolidated
districts,
those
call
for
election
by
the
general
electorate.
the
only
trustees
in
our
missouri
system
which
are
not
elected
are
the
trustees
of
the
state
university
and
state
college
which
are
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
appointment
by
the
governor.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
mr.
justice
you
asked
me
a
question
which
i
think
is
not
encompassed
within
the
issues
in
this
case
and
again
its
my
opinion
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
yet
faced
that
question.
there
were
some
suggestion
in
sailors
that
or
more
than
a
suggestion
that
the
county
board
of
education
there
was
such
a
governmental
agency
that
appointment
was
acceptable
because
this
court
based
its
decision
on
that
case
and
the
fact
that
the
selection
of
the
trustees
of
the
county
board
by
appointment
from
the
boards
of
the
school
districts
within
the
county
was
an
appointment
process
--
i
questioned
whether
an
operating
school
district
at
the
local
level
would
--
i
question
from
a
democratic
process,
standpoint
whether
it
be
desirable
that
they
be
appointed.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
don't
know.
this
court
has
not
given
me
any
guidance
on
that
point
and
i
don't
think
it's
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
certainly
in
the
sailors
case,
this
court
said
that
by
its
decision
that
the
--
in
a
different
type
of
a
school
district,
a
county
board
of
education
that
the
appointive
process
was
acceptable.
now
i
see
great
differences
between
a
county
board
of
education
where
there
are
--
the
local
area
school
boards
or
boards
of
education
and
the
situation
here,
the
county
boards
of
educations
or
a
rather
atrophied
in
--
and
the
vestigial
type
of
a
governmental
agency
in
many
cases
they
are
being
abolished.
they
are
not
districts
which
operate
school
systems.
and
i
think
really
mr.
justice
you're
presenting
the
question
of
the
legislative
versus
administrative
question
which
has
been
presented
in
several
of
this
cases.
and
it
seems
to
be,
it
may
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
where
there
is
a
law
requiring
or
providing
for
appointment
if
it
were
to
be
challenged,
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
basis
of,
“is
there
a
substantial
governmental
function
here
which
requires
election
by
the
people?”
i
do
not
think
it's
in
anyway
presented
in
this
case
because
the
statute
in
the
determination
of
the
legislature
of
missouri,
was
this
be
an
elective
process.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
and
i
simply
say
that
we're
not
faced
the
decision
in
this
case
as
to
deciding
whether
or
not
this
should
be
an
appointive
or
an
elective
office.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir,
you're
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
it
is
true.
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
on
the
question
of
substantial
government
function.
the
appellees
speak
of
school
districts
in
the
context
of
special
districts.
we
submit
that
that
language
is
a
little
meaningless
and
in
any
event
a
school
district
is
much
closer
to
a
city
council
or
a
county
government
than
to
the
traditional
concept
of
a
special
district.
i
would
prefer
to
call
them
special
youth
districts,
special
assessment
districts
or
special
benefit
districts.
they
have
normally
three
characteristics.
first
of
all,
they
specifically
affect
one
area
of
the
community.
the
water
district,
the
sewer
district,
the
levy
district
affects
the
property
owners
directly
who
are
protected
by
that
improvement.
secondly,
normally
the
assessment,
the
taxing
for
that
improvement
is
against
that
special
benefited
group.
and
thirdly,
it
is
common
for
that
specially
benefited
and
specially
taxed
group
to
have
the
right
to
be
the
special
electorate.
now,
not
one
of
these
criteria
exists
in
terms
of
a
school
district.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
our
traditional
concepts
of
the
american
public
school
system,
all
the
people
of
the
community
are
benefited
by
the
existence
of
public
schools.
second
of
all,
by
missouri
law,
all
the
citizens
of
the
community
are
taxed
for
the
schools
either
by
the
real
property
tax
or
through
the
personal
property
tax
or
to
some
extent
by
the
state
income
tax.
and
thirdly,
we
have
a
general
electorate,
so
that
none
of
the
criteria
of
the
special
district
apply.
in
terms
of
function,
i
think
it
equally
significant
that
we
are
not
talking
about
the
narrow
function
of
a
special
youth
district.
the
sewer
district,
you
run
a
sewer,
the
water
district,
you
want
to
walk
or
you
run
a
water
line,
it's
a
one
step
operation
and
from
then
on,
the
function
of
that
board
whether
it
be
elected
or
appointed
is
simply
a
minor
matter
of
collection
of
angular
assessments
and
maintenance
of
the
improvement.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
complex
problems
presented
in
the
context
of
the
day's
educational
problems
by
our
school
systems.
if
the
court
please,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
to
some
side
it
extends
but
basically
the
school
boards
are
autonomous.
they
make
all
the
major
decisions.
there
are
prescribed
to
a
limited
extent
by
a
vote
of
the
people
in
terms
for
example
of
capital
improvements
or
changes
in
school
levies,
school
boards
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
curriculum
is
the
decision
of
the
trustees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
the
same.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
as
my
understanding
that
the
state
board
of
education
is
in
a
sense
advisory,
our
state
laws
give
great
power
to
the
local
school
boards
except
for
the
familiar
exception
of
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
exercise
of
power.
but
other
than
that,
it
--
my
understanding
that
basically
the
state
board
is
advisory,
educational
in
aspect,
forward
thinking
in
terms
of
planning
but
it
is
not
a
step
in
a
governmental
structure.
it's
the
--
the
local
boards
run
their
schools.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
as
subject
to
a
vote
or
approval.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
vote
or
approve.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
refuse
to
accept
and
we
ask
this
court
not
to
accept
any
argument
which
says
that
people
living
in
the
suburbs
have
problems
different
in
regard
to
schools
whether
they
be
local
--
lower
level
schools
or
high
level
schools.
they
have
more
problems
than
do
the
people
in
the
cities
such
that
this
court
should
justify
a
mathematical
statutory
formula
which
guarantees
a
weighted
vote
in
favor
of
the
suburbs.
i'd
like
to
repeat
if
i
may
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
the
statutory
formula
with
which
we
are
dealing
in
effect
guarantees
the
small
component
district
voters,
a
weighted
vote.
the
only
situation,
purely
theoretical
in
which
the
vote
would
be
equal
would
be
if
the
large
component
school
district
has
exactly
one
third
or
exactly
50%
or
exactly
two
thirds.
the
minute
its
--
it
falls
to
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
exact
one
vote,
it
then
becomes
a
prejudicial
formula
which
moves
in
the
direction
of
prejudice
of
the
large
component
school
district.
because
you
start
with
the
third
and
if
you
have
exactly
a
third,
you
get
one
third
of
the
votes.
you're
from
one
third
to
a
half,
you
still
get
a
third.
you
must
proceed
to
the
exactitude
of
a
half
to
get
what
you're
entitled
to
as
half.
and
the
minute
you
pass
over
that
then
you
become
--
again
discriminated
against
until
you
reach
the
exact
mathematical
point
of
two
thirds.
now,
no
place
in
the
evidence
and
no
place
in
the
arguments
is
any
rational
distinction
given
for
the
need
to
have
such
a
weighted
voting
formula.
the
argument
is
made
and
it
was
heard
before
in
the
legislative
redistricting
cases
that
the
--
in
that
case,
it
was
the
rural
minority,
in
this
case,
it's
the
suburban
minority
needs
protection.
what
we
think
should
be
said
is
that
all
minorities
need
to
have
a
vote
in
proportion
to
their
voting
strength
and
we
say
that
this
formula
denies
that.
it
favors
one
group
whether
it
be
a
minority
or
in
some
situations
a
majority.
it
gives
that
one
group
a
vote
weighted
against
its
actual
population
strength.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
the
kansas
city
school
system
has
been
mentioned,
at
least
this
kansas
school
district,
the
component
district
involved
here.
and
it
now
has
a
formula
which
does
avoid
that
and
it's
relatively
simple.
it
elects
six
trustees
from
sub
districts
or
six
directors
as
they
call
it.
and
by
the
statute,
those
districts
must
be
of
equal
population
and
then
it
elects
three
at
large.
the
proposal
of
--
or
rather
the
formula
mentioned
by
justice
white
in
the
davis
versus
dusch
is
another
which
would
give
representation.
i
say
frankly
that
in
a
large
election
would
probably
do
the
same
thing
because
of
the
diverse
small
interest
group
reacting
in
terms
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
sir?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i'm
simply
giving
several
alternatives
with
the
emotions
developed
in
school
district
problems.
i
think
--
if
we're
thinking
of
wisdom
whether
than
--
rather
than
constitutionality
that
perhaps
either
the
district
selection
from
equal
population
districts
or
the
davis
versus
dusch
formula
would
be
more
responsive
to
the
wishes
or
to
--
would
more
clearly
express
the
wishes
of
people
in
terms
of
school
problems.
i
think
it
should
be
clear
that
there
are
two
issues
not
presented
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
board
may
be
appointive
or
elective.
the
statute
and
the
legislature
have
decided
that
this
is
a
governmental
body
affecting
the
public
interest
to
the
point
they
felt
it
should
be
an
elective
board.
we
simply
don't
have
the
question
in
sailors.
secondly,
we
don't
have
the
question
of
a
limited
electorate
as
there
was
in
kramer
because
here,
again
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
have
a
vote
by
all
qualified
voters
in
the
entire
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
--
i'm
told
not.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that's
correct,
simply
by
petition
without
a
party
identification.
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
our
thinking
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
schools
and
in
that
context,
the
junior
college
has
the
same
powers
as
any
public
school
in
missouri.
it
has
three
campuses.
it
has
all
the
myriad
problems
confronting
schools
today
and
i
submit
that
schools
involve
more
tensions,
more
strife
and
more
controversy
than
the
county
court
involved
in
avery
versus
midland.
the
statistics
obligingly
furnished
by
the
solicitor
general
and
his
brief
in
this
case
indicate
that
the
school
boards
are
the
most
numerous
of
all
forms
of
local
government.
they're
over
21,000
school
districts
in
this
country
and
they
constitute
over
one
fourth
of
all
local
governmental
units
and
about
10%
of
those
elect
from
districts.
about
one
half
of
all
local
governmental
expenditures
go
for
education.
now,
these
are
quantitative
figures
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
qualitative
aspect,
the
qualitative
impact
of
school
operations,
of
public
school
operations
on
our
governmental
concerns.
and
in
that
respect
that
the
concerns
of
citizens
for
the
functioning
of
their
schools
is
clearly
a
matter
of
governmental
concern
in
which
each
voters
rights
should
be
weighed
as
every
other
voters.
