mr.
william
j.
burrell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
here
that
we
go
into
some
slight
--
more
detail
to
the
type
of
district
in
junior
college
which
we
are
talking
about
and
to
how
is
it
organ
--
how
it
is
organized.
some
of
this
has
been
alluded
to.
in
the
first
place,
there
must
be
under
this
1961,
the
missouri
legislature,
a
petition
from
the
voters
of
a
certain
percentage
of
the
voters
of
each
component
school
district,
are
these
component
school
districts
generally
have
been
furnishing
elementary
and
secondary
education
to
the
youth
in
their
particular
district.
and
they
must
sign
this
petition
of
certain
percentage
of
them
and
each
component
school
district
to
form
a
junior
college
district
comprising
a
number
usually,
it
could
be
one
but
in
practice
it
has
been
a
number
of
component
school
districts.
once
this
petition
has
been
signed
by
the
proper
number
of
voters,
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
state
board
of
education
which
is
an
appointed
body,
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
either
board
could
veto
it.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
yes.
the
standards
given
to
the
board
are
three,
the
need
which
is
somewhat
general
for
the
junior
college
in
the
area
and
whether
or
not
there
are
a
sufficient
number
of
high
school
students
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
tax
base
sufficient
to
support
a
junior
college.
and
once
the
state
board
of
education
has
approved
this
petition
and
there
--
then
there
is
an
at
large
election
in
the
proposed
junior
college
--
in
the
entire
proposed
junior
college
district
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
junior
college
district
organized
in
that
area.
and
only
if
a
majority
of
all
the
voters
in
at
large
election
approve
this
petition
can
a
junior
college
district
be
organized.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
but
there
must
be
a
majority
in
an
at
large
election
in
the
entire
district.
then
the
state
board
certifies
that
this
petition
has
been
passed
and
the
trustees
are
to
be
elected
and
there
is
and
that
is
what
is
before
the
court
here,
a
statutory
formula
for
the
election
of
the
trustees
of
the
junior
college.
and
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
here,
all
that
this
board
does
or
this
six
member
board
of
trustees
is
operate
one
junior
college
in
the
junior
college
district.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it
was
all
passed
substantially
in
1961.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
before
that
the
individual
component
school
districts
could
have
their
own
junior
college
just
like
they
have
their
own
high
school.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
at
that
time
and
it
is
of,
i
think
considerable
importance,
there
were
seven
such
junior
colleges
in
missouri
where
the
total
number
of
students
of
what
--
of
somewhat
over
5,000.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
but
i
think
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
the
law
was
passed
in
order
to
foster
and
encourage
the
development
of
the
junior
college
system.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
there
are
today,
i
think
if
it
was
at
the
time
this
brief
were
filed,
ten
junior
college
districts
in
missouri
with
about
29,000
students
and
today
there
are
twelve,
i
think
with
somewhat
over
30,000
students
and
was
component
to
covering
an
area
of
component
school
district
of
somewhere
near
a
hundred
and
20
as
opposed
to
the
seven
junior
colleges
in
seven
component
districts
that
were
affected
in
1961.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
will
say
this
that
the
--
and
i
this
were
to
answer
in
part
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
the
curriculum
is
uniform
curriculum
of
--
for
all
the
junior
colleges
is
controlled
by
the
state
board
of
education
with
the
view
that
the
--
by
a
statute,
they
must
consider
the
admission
requirements
of
the
university
of
missouri.
and
so
that's
--
this
is
really
designed
i
know
that
a
year
ago,
for
example,
in
kansas
city,
we
could
enter
a
charge
to
the
students
in
our
district
was
$4
to
$20.
or
if
you
took
an
ordinary
course
of
fifteen
hours,
it
was
$60.00
tuition.
but
the
students
in
our
district
could
graduate
and
the
curriculum
is
adjusted
so
that
they
can
go
from
the
junior
college
to
the
university
of
missouri
if
they
desire
to
follow
tat
type
of
program.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
determined
by
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
with
respect
to
getting
the
money
to
build
the
building
and
require
the
land.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
would
have
to
be
normally
done
by
a
bond
issue
which
would
be
voted
upon
by
the
people.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
subject
to
getting
the
money
by
the
bond
approval.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
that
would
require
actually
a
two-thirds
vote.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
that
that
is
the
way
as
--
it
was
--
it
conceivably
started.
it
was
count
one
of
the
petition
here.
was
an
objection
to
the
location
of
the
campus.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
the
term
of
office
is
six
years.
but
there
are
--
they're
staggered,
so
there're
two
elected
each
two
years.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
by
--
when
the
voters
vote
to
organize
the
district
they
specifically
authorize
a
levy
in
our
district
of
up
to
ten
cents
for
a
hundred
dollar
evaluation
in
our
district
by
the
board
of
trustees
without
voter
approval.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
there's
quite
a
little
difference
--
there's
quite
a
little
difference
in
amount
for
example
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
think
that
basically
there
is
any
general
difference
there.
we
--
in
the
junior
college
district,
it
can
levy
up
to
ten
cents
without
voter
approval.
it
has
been
authorized
however,
the
voters
have
been
presented
that
that
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
that
is
one
package
they
agreed
on.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
the
kansas
city
school
board
i
believe
is
--
this
is
correct,
it
can
go
up
to
three
dollars
and
75
cents
for
a
hundred
dollar
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
how
would
the
members
pay
--
there
is
a
new
law
which
just
went
into
effect
in
january
with
the
kansas
city
school
board
an
i'm
not
certain
about
the
exact
provisions
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
under
the
old
law,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
we
had
two
political
parties
select
half
of
the
board
and
each
political
party
and
then
they
were
all
voted
on
and
this
by
--
some
understanding
there
was
never
any
opposition
if
my
recollection
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
would
--
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
state.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
special
purpose
body
with
the
sole
function
of
operating
a
two
year
college.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
there's
no
fundamental
difference
except
in
degree
and
i
suppose
junior
college
has
less
impact
on
the
entire
area
than
the
elementary
and
the
high
schools
do.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
or
its
education,
its
education.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it's
same
type
of
function,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
they
were
operated
by
the
various
component
by
--
component
school
districts?
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
they
were
what
we
would
call
--
most
of
it
are
what
we
call
a
six
member
board,
local
school
districts
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no.
they
would
--
under
the
old
system,
they
would've
operated
the
junior
college,
the
high
school,
the
elementary
school.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
might
say
here
that
the
--
we
have
six
trustees
and
the
allocation
is
on
the
basis
of
school
enumeration
which
has
been
as
suggested
to
you,
the
number
of
persons
in
the
component
school
district
between
the
ages
of
six
and
twenty.
and
i
think
that
is
related
to
the
interest
of
the
particular
component
school
district
in
the
junior
college
program.
and
the
formula
we
--
which
we
submit
is
not
--
is
invidious
and
is
reasonable
is
that
if
their
one
component
has
a
third
of
the
trustees,
it
may
select
two
of
the
six,
if
it
has
50%
it
may
select
three,
if
it
has
two-thirds,
it
may
select
four.
the
remaining
trustees
are
selected
if
--
from
the
remaining
component
school
districts
is
conceivable
here
that
you
could
have
two
component
district
each
selecting
two
trustees
with
the
remainder
selected
outside
these
two
component
school
districts.
the
metropolitan
junior
college
district
is
the
one
that
is
before
the
court
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
instituted.
we
had
63%
of
the
school
enumerated
persons
in
our
districts
and
elected
three
trustees
at
the
time
of
these
briefs,
we
had
59,
i
think
at
the
present
time,
we
have
57%
of
the
total
number
of
school
enumerated
persons
in
the
entire
junior
college
district.
it
is
an
urban,
suburban
rural
composite;
i
think
that
was
what
we
do
have
in
most
of
our
junior
college
systems,
a
combination
of
urban,
suburban
and
rural
areas.
we
have
in
kansas
city
8
component
school
districts,
a
400
square
miles
in
all
embracing
at
least
parts
of
4
counties.
i
think
that
the
metropolitan
junior
college
district
or
junior
college
district
in
missouri
is
truly
a
special
purpose
body.
the
court
below,
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
a
six-to-one
decision
upholding
this
law
held
it
to
be
or
stated
it
is
truly
a
special
purpose
unit.
the
dissent,
there
was
one
dissent
below
conceded
that
this
is
not
primarily
a
legislative
body
exercising
general
governmental
functions.
the
united
states
has
filed
the
brief
here,
its
amicus
curiae
and
as
stated
in
essence
the
basic
function
of
the
district
is
to
supervise
the
operation
and
program
of
a
two-year
public
education
at
the
college
level.
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
stated,
we
hold
that
the
defendant
is
essentially
an
administrative
body
created
by
the
legislature
for
the
sole
and
special
purpose
of
conducting
a
two-year
college
institution.
and
that
it
is
not
a
unit
of
local
government
having
general
governmental
powers
over
the
entire
geographic
are
observed
by
the
body.
of
course
that
is
the
language
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
avery.
its
powers
are
circumscribe,
the
taxing
power
and
bonding
power
was
--
it
had
no
parties
or
any
bond
without
the
approval
of
two-third
of
the
voters.
it
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
state
board
of
education
by
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
the
initiation
for
the
development
of
the
junior
college
must
come
from
the
people.
the
statute
does
not
organize
any
junior
college,
it
merely
sets
forth
a
system
whereby
a
junior
college,
a
community
in
effect
or
metropolitan
junior
college
may
be
formed.
the
statute
which
is
the
appendix
on
appendix
2a
of
the
brief
of
appellees
provides
that
the
budgeting
policies,
the
curriculum,
the
entrance
requirements
are
all
under
the
state
board
of
education
as
to
all
of
the
junior
colleges
formed
under
this
particular
law.
the
missouri
supreme
court
below
has
stated
and
i
think
it
is
very
accurate
that
this
body
has
no
power
to
do
the
multitude
o
things
which
a
city
or
a
county
may
do
under
this
broad
delegation
of
powers
and
under
its
inherent
powers.
its
duties,
its
authorities
are
essentially
administrative
and
this
certainly
is
language
as
has
been
used
by
this
court,
its
powers
are
not
legislative
in
the
classical
sense.
it
doesn't
pass
laws,
it
doesn't
have
the
police
powers,
the
government
has
acknowledge
here
that
our
situation
is
somewhat
a
typical
in
that
we
are
not
the
common
type
of
elementary
and
secondary
school
district
which
is
common
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
know
that
i
can
remember
in
detail
there
as
i
recall
there
in
kramer,
they
established
a
school
district
which
furnished
education
for
the
entire
district
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
around
the
schools
and
we
run
one
junior
college.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
plausibly
more
than
in
substance,
however,
there
is
some
differences,
there's
considerable
difference
in
the
impact
on
the
community,
we
are
not
affected
by
compulsory
attendant
school
laws,
it's
a
voluntary
program
insofar
as
entering
a
school
is
concern.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
wouldn't
know
about
--
no,
sir
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
said
principle
of
that,
no.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
i
think
the
statute
starts
out
of
course
it
says
that
first
that
the
trustee
shall
be
elected
at
large
except
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
except
--
and
then
is
it
except
if
one
component
school
district
has
once
third
and
elects
two
except
that
it
has
half,
it
elects
three.
so
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
there
--
that
would
not
be
--
there
can't
be
a
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
fact
and
it
would
have
to
be
in
any
system
where
you
are
going
to
have
bodies
joining
together
and
recognize
boundary
line,
you're
going
to
have
some
of
that
situation
is
going
to
exist
like
as
you
have
pointed
out
if
you
had
57%
which
we
have
now
and
we're
going
--
we
have
six
trustees,
we
either
have
to
elect
three
or
four
if
we're
going
to
have
that
system.
and
in
doing
--
which
ever
way
we
go,
we're
going
to
have
some
disparity
from
perfection
and
apportionment.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
disagree
with
the
term
malapportionment
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
--
that
it
has
to
be
this
way.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
invidious
or
unreasonable
about
the
formula.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
i
think
very
definitely.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
because
it
encourages
the
--
particularly
the
outlying
area
is
recognized
that
they
will
have
some
trustees
on
the
board.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
would
hope
that
that
would
not
be
their
motive.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
for
example
that
a
larger
district
would
recognize
it
would
have
--
if
it
had
a
third
of
the
trustees
that
it
would
have
two
whereas
if
it
was
in
that
large
election,
it
might
not
have
any.
i
don't
think
that
at
large,
well,
in
that
large
election
is
strict
compliance
with
“one
man,
one
vote.”
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
insofar
as
reasonable
representation
is
concerned.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
the
way
the
law
is
established.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
isn't
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
essentially
the
members
of
the
board
are
selected
to
run
this
school
and
to
act
essentially
in
an
administrative
capacity
and
not
as
a
representation
of
the
constituents
in
the
districts
from
which
they
are
elected.
i
think
in
the
review
that
has
been
made
here
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
a
junior
college
district
is
not
a
unit
of
local
government
having
general
governmental
powers
over
the
entire
geographic
areas
served
by
the
body.
now,
that
is
the
language
which
was
used
by
this
court
in
avery
with
respect
to
the
midland
county
commissioner's
court.
this
junior
college
body
is
not
a
body
having
general
governmental
powers
over
an
entire
geographic
area,
again
language
used
by
this
court
in
avery.
it
is
not
a
representative
of
most
of
the
general
governing
bodies
of
american
cities,
counties,
towns
and
villages
as
was
the
midland
county
commissioner's
court
held
to
be
in
the
avery
decision.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
some
of
our
discussion
as
to
population
that
we've
entered
into
here
in
sailors
which
involved
a
school
board,
there
was
a
disparity
of
201,000
in
one
district
to
99
in
another
although
concededly,
while
the
local
boards
were
elected,
the
county
board
was
appointed.
in
avery,
there
was
a
disparity
of
67,000
to
414.
in
dusch
versus
davis
which
--
raised,
fairly
recently
decided
which
had
a
residency
requirement.
there
was
a
difference
there
of
29,000
to
33.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
at
the
present
time
in
our
district,
we
don't
have
any
--
our
apportionment
is
based
on
school
enumeration,
i
don't
--
and
we
have
57%,
the
district
has
of
the
school
enumerated
persons
in
the
entire
district
and
we
select
three
of
the
six
trustees.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
that
would
be
quite
a
problem
to
substitute
something
that
the
legislature
would
deem
--
that
would
be
willing
to
pass,
it
could
substitute
an
at
large
throughout
the
entire
--
throughout
the
--
are
which
of
course
is
what
the
legislature
didn't
want
to
do
in
the
first
instance.
it
could
of
course
require
that
there'd
be
six
sub-districts
of
equal
population,
that's
always
certainly
could
be
possible.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
a
possible.
that
is
a
possible
plan
whether
or
not
the
legislature
would
be
able
to
pass
for
--
the
law
was
fair
and
it
would
encourage
a
development
of
the
system
as
it
has
developed
is
another
question.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
important
here
that
we
go
into
some
slight
--
more
detail
to
the
type
of
district
in
junior
college
which
we
are
talking
about
and
to
how
is
it
organ
--
how
it
is
organized.
some
of
this
has
been
alluded
to.
in
the
first
place,
there
must
be
under
this
1961,
the
missouri
legislature,
a
petition
from
the
voters
of
a
certain
percentage
of
the
voters
of
each
component
school
district,
are
these
component
school
districts
generally
have
been
furnishing
elementary
and
secondary
education
to
the
youth
in
their
particular
district.
and
they
must
sign
this
petition
of
certain
percentage
of
them
and
each
component
school
district
to
form
a
junior
college
district
comprising
a
number
usually,
it
could
be
one
but
in
practice
it
has
been
a
number
of
component
school
districts.
once
this
petition
has
been
signed
by
the
proper
number
of
voters,
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
state
board
of
education
which
is
an
appointed
body,
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
either
board
could
veto
it.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
yes.
the
standards
given
to
the
board
are
three,
the
need
which
is
somewhat
general
for
the
junior
college
in
the
area
and
whether
or
not
there
are
a
sufficient
number
of
high
school
students
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
tax
base
sufficient
to
support
a
junior
college.
and
once
the
state
board
of
education
has
approved
this
petition
and
there
--
then
there
is
an
at
large
election
in
the
proposed
junior
college
--
in
the
entire
proposed
junior
college
district
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
junior
college
district
organized
in
that
area.
and
only
if
a
majority
of
all
the
voters
in
at
large
election
approve
this
petition
can
a
junior
college
district
be
organized.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
but
there
must
be
a
majority
in
an
at
large
election
in
the
entire
district.
then
the
state
board
certifies
that
this
petition
has
been
passed
and
the
trustees
are
to
be
elected
and
there
is
and
that
is
what
is
before
the
court
here,
a
statutory
formula
for
the
election
of
the
trustees
of
the
junior
college.
and
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
here,
all
that
this
board
does
or
this
six
member
board
of
trustees
is
operate
one
junior
college
in
the
junior
college
district.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it
was
all
passed
substantially
in
1961.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
before
that
the
individual
component
school
districts
could
have
their
own
junior
college
just
like
they
have
their
own
high
school.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
at
that
time
and
it
is
of,
i
think
considerable
importance,
there
were
seven
such
junior
colleges
in
missouri
where
the
total
number
of
students
of
what
--
of
somewhat
over
5,000.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
but
i
think
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
the
law
was
passed
in
order
to
foster
and
encourage
the
development
of
the
junior
college
system.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
there
are
today,
i
think
if
it
was
at
the
time
this
brief
were
filed,
ten
junior
college
districts
in
missouri
with
about
29,000
students
and
today
there
are
twelve,
i
think
with
somewhat
over
30,000
students
and
was
component
to
covering
an
area
of
component
school
district
of
somewhere
near
a
hundred
and
20
as
opposed
to
the
seven
junior
colleges
in
seven
component
districts
that
were
affected
in
1961.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
will
say
this
that
the
--
and
i
this
were
to
answer
in
part
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
the
curriculum
is
uniform
curriculum
of
--
for
all
the
junior
colleges
is
controlled
by
the
state
board
of
education
with
the
view
that
the
--
by
a
statute,
they
must
consider
the
admission
requirements
of
the
university
of
missouri.
and
so
that's
--
this
is
really
designed
i
know
that
a
year
ago,
for
example,
in
kansas
city,
we
could
enter
a
charge
to
the
students
in
our
district
was
$4
to
$20.
or
if
you
took
an
ordinary
course
of
fifteen
hours,
it
was
$60.00
tuition.
but
the
students
in
our
district
could
graduate
and
the
curriculum
is
adjusted
so
that
they
can
go
from
the
junior
college
to
the
university
of
missouri
if
they
desire
to
follow
tat
type
of
program.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
determined
by
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
with
respect
to
getting
the
money
to
build
the
building
and
require
the
land.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
would
have
to
be
normally
done
by
a
bond
issue
which
would
be
voted
upon
by
the
people.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
subject
to
getting
the
money
by
the
bond
approval.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
that
would
require
actually
a
two-thirds
vote.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
that
that
is
the
way
as
--
it
was
--
it
conceivably
started.
it
was
count
one
of
the
petition
here.
was
an
objection
to
the
location
of
the
campus.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
the
term
of
office
is
six
years.
but
there
are
--
they're
staggered,
so
there're
two
elected
each
two
years.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
by
--
when
the
voters
vote
to
organize
the
district
they
specifically
authorize
a
levy
in
our
district
of
up
to
ten
cents
for
a
hundred
dollar
evaluation
in
our
district
by
the
board
of
trustees
without
voter
approval.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
there's
quite
a
little
difference
--
there's
quite
a
little
difference
in
amount
for
example
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
think
that
basically
there
is
any
general
difference
there.
we
--
in
the
junior
college
district,
it
can
levy
up
to
ten
cents
without
voter
approval.
it
has
been
authorized
however,
the
voters
have
been
presented
that
that
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
that
is
one
package
they
agreed
on.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
the
kansas
city
school
board
i
believe
is
--
this
is
correct,
it
can
go
up
to
three
dollars
and
75
cents
for
a
hundred
dollar
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
how
would
the
members
pay
--
there
is
a
new
law
which
just
went
into
effect
in
january
with
the
kansas
city
school
board
an
i'm
not
certain
about
the
exact
provisions
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
under
the
old
law,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
we
had
two
political
parties
select
half
of
the
board
and
each
political
party
and
then
they
were
all
voted
on
and
this
by
--
some
understanding
there
was
never
any
opposition
if
my
recollection
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
would
--
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
state.
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
special
purpose
body
with
the
sole
function
of
operating
a
two
year
college.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
there's
no
fundamental
difference
except
in
degree
and
i
suppose
junior
college
has
less
impact
on
the
entire
area
than
the
elementary
and
the
high
schools
do.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
or
its
education,
its
education.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it's
same
type
of
function,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
they
were
operated
by
the
various
component
by
--
component
school
districts?
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
they
were
what
we
would
call
--
most
of
it
are
what
we
call
a
six
member
board,
local
school
districts
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no.
they
would
--
under
the
old
system,
they
would've
operated
the
junior
college,
the
high
school,
the
elementary
school.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
might
say
here
that
the
--
we
have
six
trustees
and
the
allocation
is
on
the
basis
of
school
enumeration
which
has
been
as
suggested
to
you,
the
number
of
persons
in
the
component
school
district
between
the
ages
of
six
and
twenty.
and
i
think
that
is
related
to
the
interest
of
the
particular
component
school
district
in
the
junior
college
program.
and
the
formula
we
--
which
we
submit
is
not
--
is
invidious
and
is
reasonable
is
that
if
their
one
component
has
a
third
of
the
trustees,
it
may
select
two
of
the
six,
if
it
has
50%
it
may
select
three,
if
it
has
two-thirds,
it
may
select
four.
the
remaining
trustees
are
selected
if
--
from
the
remaining
component
school
districts
is
conceivable
here
that
you
could
have
two
component
district
each
selecting
two
trustees
with
the
remainder
selected
outside
these
two
component
school
districts.
the
metropolitan
junior
college
district
is
the
one
that
is
before
the
court
at
the
time
that
this
action
was
instituted.
we
had
63%
of
the
school
enumerated
persons
in
our
districts
and
elected
three
trustees
at
the
time
of
these
briefs,
we
had
59,
i
think
at
the
present
time,
we
have
57%
of
the
total
number
of
school
enumerated
persons
in
the
entire
junior
college
district.
it
is
an
urban,
suburban
rural
composite;
i
think
that
was
what
we
do
have
in
most
of
our
junior
college
systems,
a
combination
of
urban,
suburban
and
rural
areas.
we
have
in
kansas
city
8
component
school
districts,
a
400
square
miles
in
all
embracing
at
least
parts
of
4
counties.
i
think
that
the
metropolitan
junior
college
district
or
junior
college
district
in
missouri
is
truly
a
special
purpose
body.
the
court
below,
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
a
six-to-one
decision
upholding
this
law
held
it
to
be
or
stated
it
is
truly
a
special
purpose
unit.
the
dissent,
there
was
one
dissent
below
conceded
that
this
is
not
primarily
a
legislative
body
exercising
general
governmental
functions.
the
united
states
has
filed
the
brief
here,
its
amicus
curiae
and
as
stated
in
essence
the
basic
function
of
the
district
is
to
supervise
the
operation
and
program
of
a
two-year
public
education
at
the
college
level.
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
stated,
we
hold
that
the
defendant
is
essentially
an
administrative
body
created
by
the
legislature
for
the
sole
and
special
purpose
of
conducting
a
two-year
college
institution.
and
that
it
is
not
a
unit
of
local
government
having
general
governmental
powers
over
the
entire
geographic
are
observed
by
the
body.
of
course
that
is
the
language
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
avery.
its
powers
are
circumscribe,
the
taxing
power
and
bonding
power
was
--
it
had
no
parties
or
any
bond
without
the
approval
of
two-third
of
the
voters.
it
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
state
board
of
education
by
statute.
the
statute
provides
that
the
initiation
for
the
development
of
the
junior
college
must
come
from
the
people.
the
statute
does
not
organize
any
junior
college,
it
merely
sets
forth
a
system
whereby
a
junior
college,
a
community
in
effect
or
metropolitan
junior
college
may
be
formed.
the
statute
which
is
the
appendix
on
appendix
2a
of
the
brief
of
appellees
provides
that
the
budgeting
policies,
the
curriculum,
the
entrance
requirements
are
all
under
the
state
board
of
education
as
to
all
of
the
junior
colleges
formed
under
this
particular
law.
the
missouri
supreme
court
below
has
stated
and
i
think
it
is
very
accurate
that
this
body
has
no
power
to
do
the
multitude
o
things
which
a
city
or
a
county
may
do
under
this
broad
delegation
of
powers
and
under
its
inherent
powers.
its
duties,
its
authorities
are
essentially
administrative
and
this
certainly
is
language
as
has
been
used
by
this
court,
its
powers
are
not
legislative
in
the
classical
sense.
it
doesn't
pass
laws,
it
doesn't
have
the
police
powers,
the
government
has
acknowledge
here
that
our
situation
is
somewhat
a
typical
in
that
we
are
not
the
common
type
of
elementary
and
secondary
school
district
which
is
common
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
know
that
i
can
remember
in
detail
there
as
i
recall
there
in
kramer,
they
established
a
school
district
which
furnished
education
for
the
entire
district
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
around
the
schools
and
we
run
one
junior
college.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
plausibly
more
than
in
substance,
however,
there
is
some
differences,
there's
considerable
difference
in
the
impact
on
the
community,
we
are
not
affected
by
compulsory
attendant
school
laws,
it's
a
voluntary
program
insofar
as
entering
a
school
is
concern.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
wouldn't
know
about
--
no,
sir
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
said
principle
of
that,
no.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
i
think
the
statute
starts
out
of
course
it
says
that
first
that
the
trustee
shall
be
elected
at
large
except
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
except
--
and
then
is
it
except
if
one
component
school
district
has
once
third
and
elects
two
except
that
it
has
half,
it
elects
three.
so
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
there
--
that
would
not
be
--
there
can't
be
a
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
fact
and
it
would
have
to
be
in
any
system
where
you
are
going
to
have
bodies
joining
together
and
recognize
boundary
line,
you're
going
to
have
some
of
that
situation
is
going
to
exist
like
as
you
have
pointed
out
if
you
had
57%
which
we
have
now
and
we're
going
--
we
have
six
trustees,
we
either
have
to
elect
three
or
four
if
we're
going
to
have
that
system.
and
in
doing
--
which
ever
way
we
go,
we're
going
to
have
some
disparity
from
perfection
and
apportionment.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
disagree
with
the
term
malapportionment
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
--
that
it
has
to
be
this
way.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
invidious
or
unreasonable
about
the
formula.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
i
think
very
definitely.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
because
it
encourages
the
--
particularly
the
outlying
area
is
recognized
that
they
will
have
some
trustees
on
the
board.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
would
hope
that
that
would
not
be
their
motive.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
for
example
that
a
larger
district
would
recognize
it
would
have
--
if
it
had
a
third
of
the
trustees
that
it
would
have
two
whereas
if
it
was
in
that
large
election,
it
might
not
have
any.
i
don't
think
that
at
large,
well,
in
that
large
election
is
strict
compliance
with
“one
man,
one
vote.”
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
insofar
as
reasonable
representation
is
concerned.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
the
way
the
law
is
established.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
isn't
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
essentially
the
members
of
the
board
are
selected
to
run
this
school
and
to
act
essentially
in
an
administrative
capacity
and
not
as
a
representation
of
the
constituents
in
the
districts
from
which
they
are
elected.
i
think
in
the
review
that
has
been
made
here
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
a
junior
college
district
is
not
a
unit
of
local
government
having
general
governmental
powers
over
the
entire
geographic
areas
served
by
the
body.
now,
that
is
the
language
which
was
used
by
this
court
in
avery
with
respect
to
the
midland
county
commissioner's
court.
this
junior
college
body
is
not
a
body
having
general
governmental
powers
over
an
entire
geographic
area,
again
language
used
by
this
court
in
avery.
it
is
not
a
representative
of
most
of
the
general
governing
bodies
of
american
cities,
counties,
towns
and
villages
as
was
the
midland
county
commissioner's
court
held
to
be
in
the
avery
decision.
and
i
think
with
respect
to
some
of
our
discussion
as
to
population
that
we've
entered
into
here
in
sailors
which
involved
a
school
board,
there
was
a
disparity
of
201,000
in
one
district
to
99
in
another
although
concededly,
while
the
local
boards
were
elected,
the
county
board
was
appointed.
in
avery,
there
was
a
disparity
of
67,000
to
414.
in
dusch
versus
davis
which
--
raised,
fairly
recently
decided
which
had
a
residency
requirement.
there
was
a
difference
there
of
29,000
to
33.
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
at
the
present
time
in
our
district,
we
don't
have
any
--
our
apportionment
is
based
on
school
enumeration,
i
don't
--
and
we
have
57%,
the
district
has
of
the
school
enumerated
persons
in
the
entire
district
and
we
select
three
of
the
six
trustees.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
that
would
be
quite
a
problem
to
substitute
something
that
the
legislature
would
deem
--
that
would
be
willing
to
pass,
it
could
substitute
an
at
large
throughout
the
entire
--
throughout
the
--
are
which
of
course
is
what
the
legislature
didn't
want
to
do
in
the
first
instance.
it
could
of
course
require
that
there'd
be
six
sub-districts
of
equal
population,
that's
always
certainly
could
be
possible.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
a
possible.
that
is
a
possible
plan
whether
or
not
the
legislature
would
be
able
to
pass
for
--
the
law
was
fair
and
it
would
encourage
a
development
of
the
system
as
it
has
developed
is
another
question.
