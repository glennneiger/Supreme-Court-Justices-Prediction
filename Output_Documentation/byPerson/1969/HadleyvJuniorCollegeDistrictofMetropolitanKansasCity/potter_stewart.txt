justice
potter
stewart
mr.
achtenberg
who
takes
the
lead
in
the
formation
of
the
coalition
of
these
school
districts
in
order
to
form
a
junior
college
district,
how
does
that
work?
justice
potter
stewart
the
legislators
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
legislators
as
i
understand
it
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
would
it
now
that
they
have
passed
this
authorizing
law,
isn't
it
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
petition
of
a
certain
x
percentage
of
all
the
people
that
put
up
--
put
the
issue
on
the
ballot,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
who
is
it
who
selects
the
--
that
the
proposed
schools
that
they
--
proposed
junior
college
district
shall
be
these
seven
counties
for
example.
they're
probably
not
important
in
this
case
although
i
think
that's
not
--
that
it
may
be
of
some
importance
to
make
out
of
the
purpose
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
the
legislature
does
not
impose
any
limitation
upon
how
many
school
district
shall
coalesce
to
form
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
nor
any
minimum
number
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
as
a
matter
of
voluntarily
getting
the
other
of
a
number
of
school
districts
in
order
to
form
a
junior
college
district
with
the
5%
of
the
vote
in
each
school
district
and
the
--
somebody
obviously
has
to
take
the
leadership
in
proposing
the
size
and
contours
of
the
proposed
junior
college
district
and
as
i
understand
the
statute,
it
doesn't
provide
who
shall
take
the
leadership,
this
is
citizen
leadership.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
do
a
community
made
up
of
several
school
districts
and
i
suppose
as
an
incentive,
i
suppose
typically,
if
this
one
is
typical,
it's
a
core
metropolitan
school
district
plus
some
satellite
rural
or
village
school
district
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
there
has
to
be
some
incentive
to
the
rural
or
village
satellite
districts
to
join
this
core
area
in
order
to
form
a
junior
college
district.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
wondering
if
it
is
an
assumption
or
if
it
is
a
reality
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
they
were
told
by
the
legislature,
they
set
up
this
system
in
fact
if
to
use
your
phrase,
weighted
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
against
that
background
that
the
--
this
junior
college
district
was
created.
justice
potter
stewart
how
new
is
this
legislation,
this
authorizing
legislation,
junior
college
district?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you,
i'm
sorry
to
take
this
much
of
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
mean
that
kansas
city
would
have
all
of
them,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
population,
not
school
enumeration?
when
you
say
equal
in
population,
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
in
fact
--
it
isn't
like
that
registered
voter
situation
we
had
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
like
the
registered
voter
situation
we
had
in
the
(inaudible)
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
we
said
in
burns
that
the
registered
voters
might
be
a
permissible
base
provided
it
was
the
substantial
equivalent
of
a
general
population
base.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
suggesting
that
could
apply
here
using
a
school
enumeration
base?
justice
potter
stewart
by
what
--
by
virtue
of
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sanders
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
wesberry
case,
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
reason
for
my
question.
where
in
the
constitution
will
you
find
that?
you
find
that
overwriting
--
by
that
overwriting
concept
that
apparently
overrides
into
our
article
--
the
original
article
1
as
well
as
to
the
1868
amendment
in
amendment
fourteenth.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
want
to
--
where
did
you
find
that
underlying
concept
in
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
ask
you
just
a
moment.
justice
potter
stewart
are
the
policies
of
the
local
school
district's
circumscribed
by
the
policies
announced
by
state
board
of
education?
are
they
under
the
control
of
a
state
board?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
curriculum?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
board
given
any
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
there
need
not
be
a
majority
in
each
component
school
district,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
was
all
this
legislation
passed
together
about
six
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
before
that
you
didn't
--
did
you
have
any
provision
for
junior
colleges?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
one
district
junior
college?
justice
potter
stewart
one
school
district
junior.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
--
my
question
was
directed
to
the
inquiry
of
whether
or
not
its
of
any
significance
that
this
whole
creation
of
this
junior
college
district
with
by
a
majority
referendum
was
against
the
background
of
this
very
legislative
provision
for
your
representation
that's
now
being
attack
whether
or
not
it
was
in
other
words
of
action
and
reliance
so
to
speak.
the
voters
against
the
--
that
this
was
part
in
parcel
of
the
whole
system.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
do
either
but
i'm
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
encouraging
several
school
districts
to
get
together
to
form
a
junior
college
district.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
those
that
did
get
together
who
had
did
so
against
their
understanding
that
they
would
be
represented,
on
that
board,
that
was
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
trustees
paid
offices
or
unpaid?
justice
potter
stewart
told
that
they're
unpaid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they're
non-partisan,
i
suppose
that
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
far
as
party,
partisanship
goes.
