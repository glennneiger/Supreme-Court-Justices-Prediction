justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shea,
i
take
it
that
you
would
argue
that
if
there
were
no
agreement
at
all
between
a
carrier
and
its
employees,
but
they
were
in
the
process
of
negotiating
agreements
that
the
employer
could,
pending
the
working
out
of
section
--
of
these
mediation
procedures
change
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
would
you
say
that
the
union
might
waive
its
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
union
is
--
may
not
strike
pending
the
resolution
of
the
mediation
procedures,
but
the
carrier
may
change
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions
so
long
as
they
are
not
governed
by
an
existing
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
apparently
you
agree
that
this
business
of
establishing
an
outlying
terminal
was
subject
to
section
6
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it
was
proper
for
the
union
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
the
point
of
the
matter
because
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
as
the
issue
here
is
concerned
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
is
just
as
though
on
wages.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
agreed
upon
by
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
(voice
overlap)
--
i
take
it
that
you
would
take
this
as
no
difference
than
if
the
railroad
proposed
to
build
a
spur
and
the
union
didn't
want
the
spur
built,
so
they
filed
a
section
6
notice
to
keep
the
railroad
from
building
the
spur.
you
would
say
the
railroad
ought
to
be
and
they'll
go
ahead
and
build
this
spur
regardless
of
a
notice
and
the
union
says
it
shouldn't
build
the
spur
regardless
of
the
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
that
committee
reports
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
these
statements
are
different
again
upon
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
speaking
to
the
(inaudible)
richberg?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
both
testifying
under
the
same
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
jointly
drafted.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
mr.
thom
disagree
with
anything
mr.
richberg
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
there
a
difference
between
the
section
2
(7)
and
section
6
as
far
status
quo
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
a
pretty
square
statement
in
williams
about
the
way
the
court
read
section
6?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
