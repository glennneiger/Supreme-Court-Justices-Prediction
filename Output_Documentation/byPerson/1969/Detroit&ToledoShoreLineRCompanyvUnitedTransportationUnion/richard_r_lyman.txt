mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
consist
of
a
successor
organization
to
one
of
the
original
defendants,
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen
and
two
of
its
officers,
president
and
the
general
chairman
of
their
brotherhood.
originally,
when
the
case
was
filed
and
tried
below
in
the
district
court,
another
organization
was
co-defendant
and
the
suit
was
brought
to
enjoin
both
the
firemen
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
from
striking.
they
had
both
been
in
these
original
1961
negotiations,
but
the
firemen
at
the
time
they
decided
to
take
their
case
to
the
special
board
of
adjustment
have
withdrawn
their
1961
section
6
notice.
the
trainmen
however
had
not,
therefore,
the
trainmen
had
a
live
matured
right
to
strike
and
the
district
court
so
held
and
denied
the
railroad
an
injunction
against
a
strike
by
the
trainmen.
now,
of
course,
no
strike
has
in
fact
taken
place
since
that
division
or
has
there
has
been
any
threat
of
one
over
this
dispute
because
the
fact
that
the
railroad
was
enjoined
from
doing
the
thing
that
the
threatened
strike
was
alleged
to
have
been
about.
in
the
district
court,
shore
line
raised
three
contentions
in
defending
their
action.
they
said,
one,
this
was
a
minor
dispute,
not
a
major
dispute;
two,
it
involved
a
non-bargainable
matter
in
any
event
and
therefore,
the
brotherhoods
did
not
have
or
the
respondent
firemen
did
not
have
a
valid
section
6
notice
pending;
and
three,
they
argue
the
status
quo
question
which
is
before
this
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
they
no
longer
argued
the
minor
dispute
question,
but
relied
down
in
the
two
arguments,
managerial
prerogative
and
the
status
quo
argument
and
in
this
court,
they
have
abandoned
and
have
not
placed
before
the
court
the
managerial
prerogative
argument.
the
fact
is
of
course,
that
this
operating
change
in
starting
assignments
at
trenton
was
objected
to
by
the
union
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
impact
on
the
employees
in
the
sense
of
reporting
to
and
from
duty.
the
district
court
did
not
enjoin
the
railroad
from
making
any
changes
in
its
physical
facilities
or
plant
set
up
that
it
desired
to
do
and
the
court
of
appeals
makes
this
very
clear
that
it
didn't
constrain
the
district
court
as
enjoining
any
such
thing
which
might
be
in
the
area
of
managerial
prerogatives.
now
basically
shore
line
is
contending
here
that
the
status
quo
requirements
of
the
railway
labor
act
designed
to
protect
the
public
and
preserve
industrial
peace
are
strictly
limited
to
what
the
railroad
has
already
bound
itself
to
contractually.
turning
on
mr.
justice
white's
a
little
further
in
an
employment
at
will,
they
would
say
during
all
the
course
of
this
major
dispute
procedures,
they
were
free
to
change
anything
and
everything.
in
this
case,
it's
their
contention
that
part
of
the
area
of
wages,
rules
and
working
conditions
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement
and
therefore
that
as
to
that
part
of
the
working
condition
area
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
they
are
free
to
change
those,
even
though
bargaining
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
proceeding.
even
though
at
the
time
this
case
came
before
the
district
court,
the
mediation
board
had
accepted
jurisdiction
and
the
parties
were
waiting
assignment
of
a
mediator,
they
wanted
to
have
this
unilateral
change.
that
theory
can
only
be
supported
if
we
say
ultimately
that
an
employment
at
will
or
an
area
of
working
conditions
outside
the
coverage
of
the
current
contract,
the
phrase
working
conditions
is
used
in
the
statute
and
which
congress
required
the
(inaudible)
to
preserve
during
this
procedure
only
means
such
things
as
are
contractually
covered.
in
other
words,
carrier's
argument
and
it
is
set
forth
in
their
briefs
is
that
here
the
working
conditions
applicable
to
this
particular
dispute
merely
consisted
of
the
carriers'
right
to
change
working
conditions
as
it
thought
fit.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
very
sophistical
approach
to
the
count
--
to
the
problem
and
we
contend
rather
that
working
conditions
are
things
which
are
in
effect
and
which
are
being
observed
and
have
been
observed
from
the
employees'
point
of
view.
the
employee
when
he
goes
to
work
doesn't
have
an
idea
of
his
job
as
a
set
of
things
that
management
can
do
or
can't
do
in
the
abstract,
he's
interested
in
where
he
goes
to
work
and
how
much
he's
paid,
those
sort
of
things
and
there
is
a
change
certainly
from
his
point
view
and
from
any
realistic
point
of
view,
if
all
of
a
sudden,
operating
changes
are
made
by
management
whether
or
not
in
the
exercise
of
claimed
rights
under
the
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
think
that
should
be
defined
somewhat
because
it
may
enter
into
your
honor's
consideration
of
this
matter.
i
think
there
could
well
be
a
difference
in
a
situation
where
something
is
specifically
provided
for
in
an
agreement
and
a
situation
where
something
is
simply
management's
right
by
default
for
the
reason
that
the
agreement
doesn't
cover
the
subject
matter.
mr.
shea
remarked
that
the
special
board,
boards
award
conclusively
established
that
management
was
privileged
to
do
this
only
in
the
sense
that
the
special
board
held
that
there
was
no
prohibition
in
the
agreement
against
it.
the
parties
aren't
bargaining.
there
was
no
clause
in
the
agreement
that
said
from
time
to
time,
management
may
change
the
reporting
points
for
these
men.
now,
i
think
that
brings
me
into
the
argument
that
mr.
shea
made
at
the
conclusion
about
seniority
and
couldn't
they
go
ahead
and
make
the
usual
bumps,
and
furloughs
and
recalls
and
so
forth
with
the
agreement
provided
for
if
there
was
notice
pending.
of
course,
they
could
because
the
agreement
specifically
called
for
that
and
it
set
it
out
and
that
was
an
established
working
condition
without
any
question.
but
whether
there's
something
in
this
notice
or
not
--
something
in
this
nether
--
netherland
of
employment
at
will,
managerial
prerogatives,
then
the
same
consideration
is
(inaudible)
over
to
and
i
think
that
we
can
only
have
meaningful
bargaining
where
management
refrains
from
going
at
and
doing
whatever
it
wants
to
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
is
currently
bargaining
about
whether
it's
going
to
do
it.
now,
the
contention
has
been
made
here
that
section
2
(7)
and
section
6
of
the
statute
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
it
was
further
contended
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
had
conceded
at
section
--
that
there
were
four
section,
pardon
me,
four
status
quo
sections
in
the
railway
labor
act;
section
2
(7),
section
6,
section
5
and
section
10.
our
position,
of
course,
has
been
very
clearly
stated
in
our
brief.
we
contend
section
2
(7)
is
not
a
status
quo
provision
at
all.
it
is
simply
a
prohibition
against
changes
of
agreements
unilaterally.
and
it
says
that
when
there
is
a
written
agreement,
a
carrier
and
it
speaks
only
in
terms
of
the
carrier
because
they
are
the
ones
that
apply
and
administer
the
agreement
and
the
only
ones
that
have
the
power
to
change
agreements
unilaterally.
it
says
they
can't
change
it
unilaterally,
they
got
to
do
it
by
the
notice
procedure
of
section
6.
now,
that
notice
procedure
in
section
6
in
the
first
part
of
it
where
they
talk
about
giving
notice
of
changes
in
agreements
in
abiding
rates
of
payrolls
and
working
conditions,
that
is
not
really
a
status
quo
requirement.
it
is
again
simply
a
statement
of
the
mechanism
by
which
you
change
agreements.
this
notice
procedure
--
provision
for
arranging
for
conference
within
10
days
after
the
notice
requirement
of
the
conference
be
held
within
30
days
after
the
notice,
but
it's
at
the
later
part
of
section
6
that
you
then
get
into
the
true
status
quo
provisions
in
major
disputes
handling.
and
there
it
says
that
while
these
things
are
going
on,
neither
party
may
change
rates
of
rules
--
rates
of
payrolls
or
working
conditions
and
it
doesn't
--
in
the
later
part
of
that
paragraph
use
the
any
reference
to
agreements.
section
5,
providing
the
status
quo
to
be
observed
after
mediation
board
takes
over
and
after
it's
handled
and
after
it
has
failed
in
its
efforts.
that
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
agreements
at
all.
in
section
10,
the
emergency
board
status
quo
provision
say
nothing
about
agreements
and
to
speak
in
terms
that
are
completely
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
all
this
is
limited
to
this
thorough
coverage
of
an
existing
contract.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
perhaps
we
will
have
to
read
section
2
(7)
and
section
6
as
meaning
something
separate
and
apart
from
section
5
and
section
10
and
that
maybe,
maybe
we
might
be
right
in
our
interpretation
of
sections
5
and
10
but
something
different
in
the
way
of
a
status
quo
should
be
required
for
section
6.
this
court
very
recently
in
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
against
terminal
company,
jacksonville
terminal
case
that
was
decided
early
this
year
had
an
introductory
description
of
the
major
disputes
procedures
in
the
act
which
we
think
completely
refutes
any
theory
that
these
should
be
divided
into
two
stages
and
that
maybe
the
carrier
could
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
for
a
while,
but
then
was
it
going
to
have
to
pull
it
hard
and
go
back
to
the
original
status
quo
if
we
get
into
section
5
and
section
10.
in
that
decision
in
the
terminal
company
case,
and
i
must
apologize
for
not
having
the
official
paging
but
it's
22
lawyers'
edition,
page
354
in
the
lawyer's
edition
paging.
the
court
concluded
its
description
of
those
major
disputes
handling
with
this
language.
“while
the
dispute
is
working
its
way
through
these
stages,
neither
party
may
unilaterally
alter
the
status
quo,
citing
sections
2
(7),
5
(1),
6
and
10.”
the
court
clearly
does
not
on
the
basis
of
their
opinion
contemplate
any
division
in
what
is
meant
by
a
status
quo.
it's
a
uniform
sort
of
thing.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
think
the
legislative
history
which
we've
been
criticized
for
our
references
on
the
basis
that
they
refer
only
to
sections
5
and
10,
but
as
i
say,
i
think
we
must
consider
this
whole
status
quo
together
and
in
view
of
that
legislative
history,
the
mediation
board's
interpretation
is
clearly
unattainable.
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
accord
controlling
effect
to
the
interpretations
of
administrative
tribunal
if
those
interpretations
are
preferably
in
conflict
with
the
statutory
scheme
and
language
and
in
conflict
with
the
very
clear
legislative
history
that
we
find
in
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926.
we
have
referred
to
that
legislative
history
in
our
brief
commencing
at
page
12
and
that
language
is
just
completely
irreconcilable
with
any
thought
that
status
quo
means
just
the
terms
of
a
contract
that's
currently
existing.
at
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
top
of
page
13,
i'm
reading
from
mr.
richberg's
comments
before
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
he
said,
the
thought
was
to
include
in
the
broadest
way
all
the
factors
which
contributed
to
what
is
commonly
called
the
status
quo.
the
purposes
that
can
preserve,
unchanged
all
the
conditions
involved
in
the
controversy
until
there's
full
opportunity
for
presidential
investigation
within
30-day
report.
he
further
said
and
we
quote
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
“it
was
the
desire
of
those
who
attempted
to
work
out
an
agreement
on
this
to
have
a
phrase
here
which
would
be
broad
enough
so
that
in
the
ordinary
interpretation
of
language
in
its
natural
meaning,
it
would
be
well
understood
what
was
intended.”
and
then
this
is
quite
pertinent
to
our
case
too
i
believe,
he
goes
on
following
the
statement
that
i
just
read,
with
these
comments.
“it
was
not
the
desire
of
either
parties
right
in
the
section
of
the
bill
something
that
had
not
been
written
in
anywhere
else
and
that
was
an
absolute
prohibition
and
a
compulsion
against
one
party
alone
of
the
bill.”
a
question
was
raised
as
to
strikes,
this
is
not
a
one
sided
affair
and
then
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
intent
of
management
and
labor
which
had
concurred
of
course
and
agreed
upon
the
draft
to
the
1926
act
which
was
presented
to
congress
currently.
their
purpose
was
to
have
status
quo
that
applied
to
both
parties
not
just
one
and
of
course,
they
couldn't
have
worked
out
any
agreement
among
themselves.
what
the
shore
line
contends
here
is
true
in
that
what
the
unions
were
giving
up
was
the
--
their
most
cherished
right
to
strike
and
in
exchange
only
got
from
the
carrier
a
commitment
that
well
it
would
do
what
it
contracted
to
do
and
nothing
else.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
have
been
unable
find
anything
helpful
in
the
committee
reports.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
the
hearings
of
witnesses.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
richberg
spoke
for
the
labor
unions
and
mr.
thom
spoke
for
the
carriers.
mr.
richberg
put
in
practically
all
of
the
testimony
on
the
status
quo
provision.
mr.
thom
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
this
was
a
bill
that
jointly
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
was
jointly
drafted
by
railroad
management
and
railroad
labor.
mr.
thom
was
designated
as
the
representative
before
congress
of
the
railroad
industry
and
mr.
richberg
was
the
representative
of
the
unions.
in
other
words,
they
were
co-sponsors
of
the
bill.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
sir,
he
did
not.
in
fact,
it
was
made
clear
to
congress
by
both
mr.
thom
and
mr.
richberg
that
the
joint
support
of
this
bill
was
contingent
upon
the
congress
accepting
it
as
presented
to
congress.
neither
side
wanted
congress
to
change
one
sentence
in
the
bill
and
in
fact,
they
said
that
this
had
been
bargained
long
and
hard
and
that
each
side
had
given
up
things
in
order
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
bill.
the
compulsion
behind
this
joint
effort
i
suppose
was
the
fact
that
both
management
and
labor
were
interested
in
preserving
their
right
to
bargain
on
a
voluntary
basis
and
the
primary
concern
was
to
convince
congress
that
they
did
not
need
to
have
compulsory
arbitration
that
they
did
not
need
to
have
interstate
commerce
commission
review
of
wages
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
--
and
in
order
to
convince
congress
of
that,
they
felt
that
they
had
to
draft
very
strong
status
quo
measures
for
the
protection
of
the
public
against
railroad
strikes
because
that
ultimately
was
congress'
primary
interest
in
the
railway
labor
act
in
avoiding
interruptions
to
commerce.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
section
2
(7)
is
not
a
status
quo
section.
section
2
(7)
accords,
you
might
say,
legal
effect
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
in
fact,
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
imposes
a
criminal
sanction
under
the
railway
labor
act
of
violation
of
section
2
(7)
is
made
a
crime
punishable
under
prosecution
made
by
a
united
states
attorney.
incidentally,
it's
not
true
although
the
court
in
pitney
made
this
observation.
it's
not
true
that
a
violation
of
section
6
is
a
crime,
but
perhaps
that
i
assume
that
observation
was
made
because
courts
have
commonly
attended
to
take
the
first
half
of
section
6
and
treated
as
an
extension
of
section
2
(7)
on
this
serving
of
notice.
so,
that
in
many
instances,
you
will
find
a
court
talking
about
to
2
(6)
when
it's
--
i
mean,
section
6
when
it's
really
2
(7)
that
is
involved
and
it
is
2
(7)
and
2
(7)
only
that
was
involved
in
pitney.
there
was
no
section
6
notice
extended
in
pitney,
but
rather,
the
union
was
trying
to
enjoin
the
trustees
of
the
railroad
from
changing
things
without
resorting
to
section
6
under
a
notice
procedure.
i
think
that
the
williams
case
can
hardly
be
considered
determinative
here
both
in
its
facts
and
the
considerations
before
the
court.
primarily,
it
involved
the
question
of
the
railroad's
obligations
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
don't
see
in
analyzing
the
facts
where
the
railroad
made
any
change
in
working
conditions
or
wages.
the
home
porters
received
the
same
pay
or
more
after
the
act
when
went
into
effect
as
they
had
previously.
before
they
just
get
their
tips
then
the
railroad
realized
that
it
have
to
comply
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so,
they
said,
well,
if
your
tips
don't
make
it
up,
then
we'll
give
you
enough
above
your
tips
to
meet
our
obligation.
so,
from
the
employee's
point
of
view,
there
was
no
defect
or
change
in
their
working
conditions
at
all.
counsel
for
petitioner
has
written
to
the
court
advising
that
they
were
an
error
in
the
contention
in
the
statement
that
the
organization
relied
on
section
6.
before
i
close,
i
would
very
much
like
to
direct
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
again,
it
may
be
that
the
court
had
this
sort
of
overlapping
between
section
6
and
2
(7)
in
mind
and
not
that
--
the
terminal
company
did
not
have
to
serve
the
unions
with
the
section
6
notice
in
order
to
make
this
change
in
the
arrangement
for
bookkeeping
and
the
wages.
in
any
event,
some
two
years
after
this
change
was
made,
the
parties
signed
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
did
not
even
include
the
subject
of
wages.
parties
were
clearly
content
to
treat
this
not
as
a
bargaining
matter,
but
as
an
argument
about
what
the
fair
labor
standards
act
required
and
of
course,
in
any
event,
that's
not
something
that
the
parties
could
control
by
their
bargaining
statute
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
takes
proceedings
over
what's
in
the
bargaining
agreement.
just
last
week
your
honors,
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
came
to
my
attention.
it
was
decided
september
23,
national
airlines
against
machinists
unofficially
reported
at
72
labor
relations
reference
manual
2294
which
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
without
commenting
on
it
except
for
this
comment,
leading
in
hands
to
another
case
citation.
on
two
or
three
different
occasions
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
cited
with
approval
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
then
sitting
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
rutland
railway
corporation
against
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
which
is
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
here.
i
particularly
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
that
dissenting
opinion
as
rather
complete
statement
in
exposition
of
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
consist
of
a
successor
organization
to
one
of
the
original
defendants,
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen
and
two
of
its
officers,
president
and
the
general
chairman
of
their
brotherhood.
originally,
when
the
case
was
filed
and
tried
below
in
the
district
court,
another
organization
was
co-defendant
and
the
suit
was
brought
to
enjoin
both
the
firemen
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
from
striking.
they
had
both
been
in
these
original
1961
negotiations,
but
the
firemen
at
the
time
they
decided
to
take
their
case
to
the
special
board
of
adjustment
have
withdrawn
their
1961
section
6
notice.
the
trainmen
however
had
not,
therefore,
the
trainmen
had
a
live
matured
right
to
strike
and
the
district
court
so
held
and
denied
the
railroad
an
injunction
against
a
strike
by
the
trainmen.
now,
of
course,
no
strike
has
in
fact
taken
place
since
that
division
or
has
there
has
been
any
threat
of
one
over
this
dispute
because
the
fact
that
the
railroad
was
enjoined
from
doing
the
thing
that
the
threatened
strike
was
alleged
to
have
been
about.
in
the
district
court,
shore
line
raised
three
contentions
in
defending
their
action.
they
said,
one,
this
was
a
minor
dispute,
not
a
major
dispute;
two,
it
involved
a
non-bargainable
matter
in
any
event
and
therefore,
the
brotherhoods
did
not
have
or
the
respondent
firemen
did
not
have
a
valid
section
6
notice
pending;
and
three,
they
argue
the
status
quo
question
which
is
before
this
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
they
no
longer
argued
the
minor
dispute
question,
but
relied
down
in
the
two
arguments,
managerial
prerogative
and
the
status
quo
argument
and
in
this
court,
they
have
abandoned
and
have
not
placed
before
the
court
the
managerial
prerogative
argument.
the
fact
is
of
course,
that
this
operating
change
in
starting
assignments
at
trenton
was
objected
to
by
the
union
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
impact
on
the
employees
in
the
sense
of
reporting
to
and
from
duty.
the
district
court
did
not
enjoin
the
railroad
from
making
any
changes
in
its
physical
facilities
or
plant
set
up
that
it
desired
to
do
and
the
court
of
appeals
makes
this
very
clear
that
it
didn't
constrain
the
district
court
as
enjoining
any
such
thing
which
might
be
in
the
area
of
managerial
prerogatives.
now
basically
shore
line
is
contending
here
that
the
status
quo
requirements
of
the
railway
labor
act
designed
to
protect
the
public
and
preserve
industrial
peace
are
strictly
limited
to
what
the
railroad
has
already
bound
itself
to
contractually.
turning
on
mr.
justice
white's
a
little
further
in
an
employment
at
will,
they
would
say
during
all
the
course
of
this
major
dispute
procedures,
they
were
free
to
change
anything
and
everything.
in
this
case,
it's
their
contention
that
part
of
the
area
of
wages,
rules
and
working
conditions
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement
and
therefore
that
as
to
that
part
of
the
working
condition
area
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
they
are
free
to
change
those,
even
though
bargaining
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
proceeding.
even
though
at
the
time
this
case
came
before
the
district
court,
the
mediation
board
had
accepted
jurisdiction
and
the
parties
were
waiting
assignment
of
a
mediator,
they
wanted
to
have
this
unilateral
change.
that
theory
can
only
be
supported
if
we
say
ultimately
that
an
employment
at
will
or
an
area
of
working
conditions
outside
the
coverage
of
the
current
contract,
the
phrase
working
conditions
is
used
in
the
statute
and
which
congress
required
the
(inaudible)
to
preserve
during
this
procedure
only
means
such
things
as
are
contractually
covered.
in
other
words,
carrier's
argument
and
it
is
set
forth
in
their
briefs
is
that
here
the
working
conditions
applicable
to
this
particular
dispute
merely
consisted
of
the
carriers'
right
to
change
working
conditions
as
it
thought
fit.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
very
sophistical
approach
to
the
count
--
to
the
problem
and
we
contend
rather
that
working
conditions
are
things
which
are
in
effect
and
which
are
being
observed
and
have
been
observed
from
the
employees'
point
of
view.
the
employee
when
he
goes
to
work
doesn't
have
an
idea
of
his
job
as
a
set
of
things
that
management
can
do
or
can't
do
in
the
abstract,
he's
interested
in
where
he
goes
to
work
and
how
much
he's
paid,
those
sort
of
things
and
there
is
a
change
certainly
from
his
point
view
and
from
any
realistic
point
of
view,
if
all
of
a
sudden,
operating
changes
are
made
by
management
whether
or
not
in
the
exercise
of
claimed
rights
under
the
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
think
that
should
be
defined
somewhat
because
it
may
enter
into
your
honor's
consideration
of
this
matter.
i
think
there
could
well
be
a
difference
in
a
situation
where
something
is
specifically
provided
for
in
an
agreement
and
a
situation
where
something
is
simply
management's
right
by
default
for
the
reason
that
the
agreement
doesn't
cover
the
subject
matter.
mr.
shea
remarked
that
the
special
board,
boards
award
conclusively
established
that
management
was
privileged
to
do
this
only
in
the
sense
that
the
special
board
held
that
there
was
no
prohibition
in
the
agreement
against
it.
the
parties
aren't
bargaining.
there
was
no
clause
in
the
agreement
that
said
from
time
to
time,
management
may
change
the
reporting
points
for
these
men.
now,
i
think
that
brings
me
into
the
argument
that
mr.
shea
made
at
the
conclusion
about
seniority
and
couldn't
they
go
ahead
and
make
the
usual
bumps,
and
furloughs
and
recalls
and
so
forth
with
the
agreement
provided
for
if
there
was
notice
pending.
of
course,
they
could
because
the
agreement
specifically
called
for
that
and
it
set
it
out
and
that
was
an
established
working
condition
without
any
question.
but
whether
there's
something
in
this
notice
or
not
--
something
in
this
nether
--
netherland
of
employment
at
will,
managerial
prerogatives,
then
the
same
consideration
is
(inaudible)
over
to
and
i
think
that
we
can
only
have
meaningful
bargaining
where
management
refrains
from
going
at
and
doing
whatever
it
wants
to
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
is
currently
bargaining
about
whether
it's
going
to
do
it.
now,
the
contention
has
been
made
here
that
section
2
(7)
and
section
6
of
the
statute
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
it
was
further
contended
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
had
conceded
at
section
--
that
there
were
four
section,
pardon
me,
four
status
quo
sections
in
the
railway
labor
act;
section
2
(7),
section
6,
section
5
and
section
10.
our
position,
of
course,
has
been
very
clearly
stated
in
our
brief.
we
contend
section
2
(7)
is
not
a
status
quo
provision
at
all.
it
is
simply
a
prohibition
against
changes
of
agreements
unilaterally.
and
it
says
that
when
there
is
a
written
agreement,
a
carrier
and
it
speaks
only
in
terms
of
the
carrier
because
they
are
the
ones
that
apply
and
administer
the
agreement
and
the
only
ones
that
have
the
power
to
change
agreements
unilaterally.
it
says
they
can't
change
it
unilaterally,
they
got
to
do
it
by
the
notice
procedure
of
section
6.
now,
that
notice
procedure
in
section
6
in
the
first
part
of
it
where
they
talk
about
giving
notice
of
changes
in
agreements
in
abiding
rates
of
payrolls
and
working
conditions,
that
is
not
really
a
status
quo
requirement.
it
is
again
simply
a
statement
of
the
mechanism
by
which
you
change
agreements.
this
notice
procedure
--
provision
for
arranging
for
conference
within
10
days
after
the
notice
requirement
of
the
conference
be
held
within
30
days
after
the
notice,
but
it's
at
the
later
part
of
section
6
that
you
then
get
into
the
true
status
quo
provisions
in
major
disputes
handling.
and
there
it
says
that
while
these
things
are
going
on,
neither
party
may
change
rates
of
rules
--
rates
of
payrolls
or
working
conditions
and
it
doesn't
--
in
the
later
part
of
that
paragraph
use
the
any
reference
to
agreements.
section
5,
providing
the
status
quo
to
be
observed
after
mediation
board
takes
over
and
after
it's
handled
and
after
it
has
failed
in
its
efforts.
that
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
agreements
at
all.
in
section
10,
the
emergency
board
status
quo
provision
say
nothing
about
agreements
and
to
speak
in
terms
that
are
completely
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
all
this
is
limited
to
this
thorough
coverage
of
an
existing
contract.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
perhaps
we
will
have
to
read
section
2
(7)
and
section
6
as
meaning
something
separate
and
apart
from
section
5
and
section
10
and
that
maybe,
maybe
we
might
be
right
in
our
interpretation
of
sections
5
and
10
but
something
different
in
the
way
of
a
status
quo
should
be
required
for
section
6.
this
court
very
recently
in
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
against
terminal
company,
jacksonville
terminal
case
that
was
decided
early
this
year
had
an
introductory
description
of
the
major
disputes
procedures
in
the
act
which
we
think
completely
refutes
any
theory
that
these
should
be
divided
into
two
stages
and
that
maybe
the
carrier
could
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
for
a
while,
but
then
was
it
going
to
have
to
pull
it
hard
and
go
back
to
the
original
status
quo
if
we
get
into
section
5
and
section
10.
in
that
decision
in
the
terminal
company
case,
and
i
must
apologize
for
not
having
the
official
paging
but
it's
22
lawyers'
edition,
page
354
in
the
lawyer's
edition
paging.
the
court
concluded
its
description
of
those
major
disputes
handling
with
this
language.
“while
the
dispute
is
working
its
way
through
these
stages,
neither
party
may
unilaterally
alter
the
status
quo,
citing
sections
2
(7),
5
(1),
6
and
10.”
the
court
clearly
does
not
on
the
basis
of
their
opinion
contemplate
any
division
in
what
is
meant
by
a
status
quo.
it's
a
uniform
sort
of
thing.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
think
the
legislative
history
which
we've
been
criticized
for
our
references
on
the
basis
that
they
refer
only
to
sections
5
and
10,
but
as
i
say,
i
think
we
must
consider
this
whole
status
quo
together
and
in
view
of
that
legislative
history,
the
mediation
board's
interpretation
is
clearly
unattainable.
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
accord
controlling
effect
to
the
interpretations
of
administrative
tribunal
if
those
interpretations
are
preferably
in
conflict
with
the
statutory
scheme
and
language
and
in
conflict
with
the
very
clear
legislative
history
that
we
find
in
the
railway
labor
act
of
1926.
we
have
referred
to
that
legislative
history
in
our
brief
commencing
at
page
12
and
that
language
is
just
completely
irreconcilable
with
any
thought
that
status
quo
means
just
the
terms
of
a
contract
that's
currently
existing.
at
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
top
of
page
13,
i'm
reading
from
mr.
richberg's
comments
before
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
he
said,
the
thought
was
to
include
in
the
broadest
way
all
the
factors
which
contributed
to
what
is
commonly
called
the
status
quo.
the
purposes
that
can
preserve,
unchanged
all
the
conditions
involved
in
the
controversy
until
there's
full
opportunity
for
presidential
investigation
within
30-day
report.
he
further
said
and
we
quote
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
“it
was
the
desire
of
those
who
attempted
to
work
out
an
agreement
on
this
to
have
a
phrase
here
which
would
be
broad
enough
so
that
in
the
ordinary
interpretation
of
language
in
its
natural
meaning,
it
would
be
well
understood
what
was
intended.”
and
then
this
is
quite
pertinent
to
our
case
too
i
believe,
he
goes
on
following
the
statement
that
i
just
read,
with
these
comments.
“it
was
not
the
desire
of
either
parties
right
in
the
section
of
the
bill
something
that
had
not
been
written
in
anywhere
else
and
that
was
an
absolute
prohibition
and
a
compulsion
against
one
party
alone
of
the
bill.”
a
question
was
raised
as
to
strikes,
this
is
not
a
one
sided
affair
and
then
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
intent
of
management
and
labor
which
had
concurred
of
course
and
agreed
upon
the
draft
to
the
1926
act
which
was
presented
to
congress
currently.
their
purpose
was
to
have
status
quo
that
applied
to
both
parties
not
just
one
and
of
course,
they
couldn't
have
worked
out
any
agreement
among
themselves.
what
the
shore
line
contends
here
is
true
in
that
what
the
unions
were
giving
up
was
the
--
their
most
cherished
right
to
strike
and
in
exchange
only
got
from
the
carrier
a
commitment
that
well
it
would
do
what
it
contracted
to
do
and
nothing
else.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
have
been
unable
find
anything
helpful
in
the
committee
reports.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
the
hearings
of
witnesses.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
richberg
spoke
for
the
labor
unions
and
mr.
thom
spoke
for
the
carriers.
mr.
richberg
put
in
practically
all
of
the
testimony
on
the
status
quo
provision.
mr.
thom
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
this
was
a
bill
that
jointly
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
was
jointly
drafted
by
railroad
management
and
railroad
labor.
mr.
thom
was
designated
as
the
representative
before
congress
of
the
railroad
industry
and
mr.
richberg
was
the
representative
of
the
unions.
in
other
words,
they
were
co-sponsors
of
the
bill.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no
sir,
he
did
not.
in
fact,
it
was
made
clear
to
congress
by
both
mr.
thom
and
mr.
richberg
that
the
joint
support
of
this
bill
was
contingent
upon
the
congress
accepting
it
as
presented
to
congress.
neither
side
wanted
congress
to
change
one
sentence
in
the
bill
and
in
fact,
they
said
that
this
had
been
bargained
long
and
hard
and
that
each
side
had
given
up
things
in
order
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
bill.
the
compulsion
behind
this
joint
effort
i
suppose
was
the
fact
that
both
management
and
labor
were
interested
in
preserving
their
right
to
bargain
on
a
voluntary
basis
and
the
primary
concern
was
to
convince
congress
that
they
did
not
need
to
have
compulsory
arbitration
that
they
did
not
need
to
have
interstate
commerce
commission
review
of
wages
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
--
and
in
order
to
convince
congress
of
that,
they
felt
that
they
had
to
draft
very
strong
status
quo
measures
for
the
protection
of
the
public
against
railroad
strikes
because
that
ultimately
was
congress'
primary
interest
in
the
railway
labor
act
in
avoiding
interruptions
to
commerce.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
section
2
(7)
is
not
a
status
quo
section.
section
2
(7)
accords,
you
might
say,
legal
effect
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
in
fact,
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
imposes
a
criminal
sanction
under
the
railway
labor
act
of
violation
of
section
2
(7)
is
made
a
crime
punishable
under
prosecution
made
by
a
united
states
attorney.
incidentally,
it's
not
true
although
the
court
in
pitney
made
this
observation.
it's
not
true
that
a
violation
of
section
6
is
a
crime,
but
perhaps
that
i
assume
that
observation
was
made
because
courts
have
commonly
attended
to
take
the
first
half
of
section
6
and
treated
as
an
extension
of
section
2
(7)
on
this
serving
of
notice.
so,
that
in
many
instances,
you
will
find
a
court
talking
about
to
2
(6)
when
it's
--
i
mean,
section
6
when
it's
really
2
(7)
that
is
involved
and
it
is
2
(7)
and
2
(7)
only
that
was
involved
in
pitney.
there
was
no
section
6
notice
extended
in
pitney,
but
rather,
the
union
was
trying
to
enjoin
the
trustees
of
the
railroad
from
changing
things
without
resorting
to
section
6
under
a
notice
procedure.
i
think
that
the
williams
case
can
hardly
be
considered
determinative
here
both
in
its
facts
and
the
considerations
before
the
court.
primarily,
it
involved
the
question
of
the
railroad's
obligations
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
don't
see
in
analyzing
the
facts
where
the
railroad
made
any
change
in
working
conditions
or
wages.
the
home
porters
received
the
same
pay
or
more
after
the
act
when
went
into
effect
as
they
had
previously.
before
they
just
get
their
tips
then
the
railroad
realized
that
it
have
to
comply
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so,
they
said,
well,
if
your
tips
don't
make
it
up,
then
we'll
give
you
enough
above
your
tips
to
meet
our
obligation.
so,
from
the
employee's
point
of
view,
there
was
no
defect
or
change
in
their
working
conditions
at
all.
counsel
for
petitioner
has
written
to
the
court
advising
that
they
were
an
error
in
the
contention
in
the
statement
that
the
organization
relied
on
section
6.
before
i
close,
i
would
very
much
like
to
direct
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
again,
it
may
be
that
the
court
had
this
sort
of
overlapping
between
section
6
and
2
(7)
in
mind
and
not
that
--
the
terminal
company
did
not
have
to
serve
the
unions
with
the
section
6
notice
in
order
to
make
this
change
in
the
arrangement
for
bookkeeping
and
the
wages.
in
any
event,
some
two
years
after
this
change
was
made,
the
parties
signed
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
did
not
even
include
the
subject
of
wages.
parties
were
clearly
content
to
treat
this
not
as
a
bargaining
matter,
but
as
an
argument
about
what
the
fair
labor
standards
act
required
and
of
course,
in
any
event,
that's
not
something
that
the
parties
could
control
by
their
bargaining
statute
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
takes
proceedings
over
what's
in
the
bargaining
agreement.
just
last
week
your
honors,
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
came
to
my
attention.
it
was
decided
september
23,
national
airlines
against
machinists
unofficially
reported
at
72
labor
relations
reference
manual
2294
which
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
without
commenting
on
it
except
for
this
comment,
leading
in
hands
to
another
case
citation.
on
two
or
three
different
occasions
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
cited
with
approval
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
then
sitting
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
rutland
railway
corporation
against
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
which
is
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
here.
i
particularly
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
that
dissenting
opinion
as
rather
complete
statement
in
exposition
of
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
