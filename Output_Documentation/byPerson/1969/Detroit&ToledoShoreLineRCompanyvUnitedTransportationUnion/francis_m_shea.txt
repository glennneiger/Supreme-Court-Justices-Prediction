mr.
chief

please
the
court.

this
case
arises
under
the
railway
labor
act.
as
your
honors
are
well
aware,
there
are
two
kinds
of
disputes
that
arise
under
that
act.
the
so-called
minor
disputes
which
involve
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
existing
agreements
and
they
follow
the
course
of
negotiation
and
if
that
fails,
compulsory
arbitration
before
an
adjustment
board
whose
decisions
are
final
and
binding
on
the
parties.
and
then
there's
the
major
dispute
involving
not
the
interpretation
or
application
of
existing
agreements,
but
the
making
or
changing
of
existing
agreements
and
these
follow
a
different
course.
section
6
notice
proposing
a
change
is
served
as
negotiation,
mediation
and
proffer
of
arbitration
in
the
discretion
of
the
president's
appointment
of
an
emergency
board
and
then
the
parties
are
free
to
exercise
self-help
at
the
end
of
that
route.
in
this
case,
an
adjustment
board
determined
that
there
was
nothing
in
existing
agreements
which
precluded
shore
line
from
establishing
an
outlying
reporting
point,
the
point
at
which
a
fireman
might
be
required
to
report
for
work
at
the
end
of
the
day
away
from
the
main
terminal.
shore
line
proposed
to
establish
such
a
point.
the
union
served
a
notice
proposing
that
the
exclusive
reporting
point
should
be
at
the
home
terminal
at
toledo.
and
the
court
below
held
that
in
virtue
of
the
mere
filing
of
that
notice
to
deprive
shore
line
of
its
right
under
the
existing
agreement
to
establish
an
outlying
terminal,
that
was
accomplished
and
they
were
deprived
of
that
right.
now,
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
shore
line
is
a
small
railroad.
it
runs
about
50
miles
from
toledo
to
detroit.
lang
yard
is
the
mainline.
the
yard
at
toledo
is
the
yard
just
south
of
detroit
called
dearoad
and
there's
one
other
geographic
point
i
have
in
mind,
that's
at
trenton
where
there's
the
edison
yard,
that's
about
35
miles
north
of
toledo.
there's
a
growing
and
large
industrial
development
at
trenton.
while
outlying
points
have
historically
been
established,
for
many
years,
trenton
was
served
by
firemen
who
reported
at
the
toledo
yard
and
took
their
--
went
with
their
engines
up
to
trenton,
did
the
switching
there,
then
went
back
to
35
miles
and
tied
up
at
toledo.
in
1961,
this
growing
industrial
development
in
the
view
of
the
railroad
required
that
they
establish
an
outlying
point
at
trenton
and
they
served
or
they
proposed
to
the
union
that
they
would
establish
an
outlying
point
at
trenton.
the
union
served
a
section
6
notice
proposing
negotiations
on
terms
or
conditions
under
which
that
outlying
assignment
should
be
established.
negotiations
were
to
had,
mediation
was
had,
proffer
of
arbitration,
finally,
the
matter
was
released.
but
at
that
time
there
was
no
strike
and
at
a
subsequent
point
the
union
withdrew
that
notice
and
there
wasn't
the
establishment
of
the
reporting
point
of
trenton.
the
alternate
year
for
switching
at
montesanto
by
shore
line
could
pass
and
they
said
we
don't
to
propose
to
establish
this
point
at
trenton.
but
in
the
meantime
late
1962
and
in
again
september
1963,
they
established
an
outlying
point
just
south
of
detroit
and
called
it
dearoad
and
on
this
occasion
the
union
pursued
the
minor
dispute
route.
it
took
it
to
an
adjustment
board
and
it
urged
that
under
existing
agreements,
and
under
their
existing
practices
shore
line
was
barred
from
establishing
this
outlying
reporting
point
at
dearoad.
the
adjustment
board
decided
against
them.
the
adjustment
board
said
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
of
agreement
which
precludes
the
establishment
at
that
point
and
i
think
it's
not
contested
that
under
the
existing
agreements
then
shore
line
was
privileged
to
establish
that
outlying
point.
they
then
proposed
again
to
establish
an
outlying
reporting
point
at
trenton
and
the
response
to
that
was
a
section
6
notice
proposing
that
the
only
point
at
which
firemen
might
be
required
to
report
would
be
the
toledo
yard.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
right
and
which
would
deny
shore
line
of
the
right
that
they
then
had
to
establish
the
outlying
points.
there
was
a
negotiation
about
this
and
that
didn't
get
anywhere.
the
union
invoked
the
issue
and
the
mediation
was
pending
at
the
time
of
this
record
was
made.
in
late
september
1966,
shore
line
being
confronted
with
the
immediate
requirement
again
switching
montesanto
with
mcclould
having
demanded
a
series
of
it,
they
posted
a
bulletin
establishing
an
outlying
assignment
at
trenton
for
trains
to
operate
in
the
switching
of
these
industrial
establishments
at
trenton.
at
that
point,
the
union
threatened
a
strike.
shore
line
sought
an
injunction
against
the
strike.
the
union
counterclaimed
for
an
injunction
against
the
establishment
of
this
outlying
point.
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
against
the
strike,
granted
the
injunction
against
the
establishment
of
the
outlying
point.
the
court
below
affirmed
and
the
issue
is,
i
suppose,
is
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
on
certiorari
to
this
court.
now,
the
only
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
are
actually
involved
here
are
section
2
(7)
and
section
6,
the
so-called
status
quo
provision
of
section
6,
in
fact
you've
indicated
that
these
two
sections
have
to
be
read
together
and
may
i
read
them
to
you.
the
first
appears
on
section
2
(a),
page
2
(a)
of
our
brief
and
that
section
2
(7)
which
reads
as
follows:
“no
carrier,
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
or
in
section
6
of
the
act.”
now,
i
think
there's
no
contest
about
the
fact
that
that
bars
only
a
change
in
the
existing
agreements.
it
does
not
deprive
the
parties
of
the
rights
under
the
existing
agreements.
and
section
6
reads,
carriers,
that's
on
5
(a)
of
the
appendix,
“carriers
and
representative
to
the
employees
shall
give
at
least
30
days
written
notice
of
an
intended
change
in
agreements
affecting
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
with
time
and
place
in
the
beginning
of
conferences
between
representatives
of
parties
in
such
intended
change
should
be
agreed
upon
within
ten
days
after
the
receipt
of
said
notice.
that
time
should
be
within
the
30
days
provided
in
every
case
where
such
notice
of
an
intended
change
has
been
given
or
conferences
are
being
held
with
reference
thereto
of
service
of
the
mediation
board
have
been
requested
by
either
party
or
said
board
has
proffered
its
services,
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
shall
not
be
altered
by
the
carrier
until
the
controversy
has
been
finally
acted
upon
as
required
by
section
5
of
this
act
by
the
mediation
board”
etcetera.
now,
what
we
say
that
this
provision
of
section
6
means
read
together
with
section
2
is
what
this
court
said
it
meant
in
williams
against
the
terminal
company.
here's
what
the
court
said,
"the
institution
of
negotiations,"
that
is
the
filing
of
the
section
6
notice,
“the
institution
of
negotiations
for
collective
bargaining
does
not
change
the
authority
of
the
carrier.”
the
prohibitions
of
section
6,
against
change
of
wages
or
conditions
pending
bargaining
and
those
of
section
2
(7)
are
aimed
at
preventing
changes
in
conditions
previously
fixed
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
but
we
say
section
6
means
is
again
what
this
court
said
it
meant
in
order
of
railroad
conductors
against
pitney.
there
this
court
said,
2
(7)
of
the
act
provides
that
no
carrier
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class,
as
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
under
section
6
of
the
act.
section
6
as
we
have
seen
prohibits
such
change
unless
notice
is
first
given
and
its
requirements
were
otherwise
complied
with.
section
2
(10)
of
the
act
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
both
fine
and
imprisonment
for
a
carrier
willfully
that
violates
section
6.
these
sections,
these
sections
make
it
clear
that
the
only
conduct
which
would
violate
section
6
is
a
change
of
those
working
conditions
which
are
embodied
in
agreements.
now,
what
we
think
it
means
is
also
what
the
mediation
board
has
consistently
interpreted
as
meaning.
since
1956,
the
board
repeated,
mediation
board
repeatedly
in
its
annual
reports,
in
its
instructions
to
mediate
it,
in
its
response
to
demands
of
the
unions,
repeatedly
they
have
said
this,
and
i
read
their
latest
pronouncement,
pronouncements
earlier
were
of
a
kind.
in
brief,
“the
rights
of
the
parties
which
they
had
prior
serving
the
notice
of
intention
to
change,
that's
part
of
the
serving
the
section
6
notice,
the
rights
of
the
parties
which
they
had
prior
to
serving
the
notice
of
intention
to
change
remained
the
same
during
the
period
the
proposal
is
under
consideration
and
remained
so
until
the
proposal
is
finally
acted
upon.
the
board
has
stated
in
instances
of
this
kind
that
the
serving
of
a
section
6
notice
for
a
new
rule
or
change,
a
change
in
an
existing
rule
does
not
operate,
does
not
operate
as
a
bar
to
the
carrier
actions
which
were
taken
under
rules
currently
in
effect.”
we
also
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
interpretation
which
we
give
section
6
is
the
interpretation
which
was
given
in
the
making
of
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision.
section
6,
the
initial
bill,
which
ultimately
became
in
the
subsequent
year
the
1926
act,
was
called
the
howell-barkley
bill
and
mr.
richberg
in
explaining
the
provision
that
became
section
6
from
what
was
apparently
a
prepared
text
under
the
heading
“changes
of
agreements”
had
this
to
say.
“an
agreement
that
can
be
changed
without
notice
is
really
no
agreement
at
all.
certainly,
the
power
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fear
on
the
other
of
arbitrary
change
will
read
this
court
not
harmony.”
there
is
provided
in
section
6
that
either
party
shall
give
at
least
30
days
written
notice
of
an
intended
change
and
that
the
time
and
place
of
conference
shall
be
agreed
upon,
thereafter
a
change
and
it
seems
to
me
clearly
refers
back
to
the
change
proposed,
thereafter
change
is
prohibited
until
machinery
for
peaceful
adjustment
has
been
fully
utilized.
now,
if
the
court
please,
very
important,
i
think
important
practical
considerations
which
are
entitled
to
weight.
if
i
understand
the
opposing
counsel
correctly,
he
says
that
these
so-called
status
quo
provisions
briefly
applicable,
to
indeed
asserts,
simply
applicable
to
the
union
and
to
the
carrier
and
i
put
them
below
when
he
was
not
willing
to
bite
the
bullet
then
i
doubt
he
will
hear,
i
put
in
this
situation
or
these
two
situations.
one
of
the
most
cherished
rights
of
workmen
in
this
field
are
their
seniority
rights.
a
place
opens
up,
a
desirable
place,
the
man
who
has
been
there
longest
can
be
at
the
end
and
the
place
he
opens
up
than
the
man
with
the
next
greatest
seniority
can
bid
that
in
and
so
forth.
now,
the
railroads
will
suppose
serve
a
notice
saying
this
is
disrupting.
from
now
on,
we
want
to
assign
men
to
the
post
that
they
are
investigated
for.
now,
for
the
long
period,
the
intentionally
long
period
to
exhaust
the
procedures
of
the
railroad
labor
act,
are
the
seniority
right
suspended
or
to
take
another
situation
which
is
not
unusual
that
this
negotiation
of
an
agreement
for
an
increase
in
wage
is
3%
next
january,
another
2%
in
july,
another
3%
the
following
january.
they
negotiated
that
bargain
and
a
couple
of
months
later,
the
shore
line,
the
carrier
serves
notice
saying
we're
losing
money
and
we
want
to
freeze
wages.
the
length
freeze
wages
for
the
lengthy
period,
a
year,
two
years
or
more
in
which
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
being
exhausted.
now,
i
say
that
if
he
agreed
it
would
do
that.
i
can
think
of
nothing
which
would
more
be
more
disruptive
of
the
stability
of
labor
relations
or
more
frustrating
to
the
possibility
of
making
and
maintaining
agreements
in
such
a
rule.
now,
as
i
understand,
as
i
understand
his
--
the
main
thrust
of
his
argument,
it
is
that
while
the
provisions
of
section
5,
their
status
quo
provisions
of
5
and
10
which
are
not
applicable
to
here
because
this
is
still
in
mediation
and
those
are
only
applicable
only
after
the
mediation
has
terminated
or
after
the
emergency
board
is
appointed.
if
i
understand
the
main
thrust
of
his
argument,
it
is
that
all
of
these
provisions,
not
all,
six,
five
and
ten,
must
mean
the
same
thing,
not
two
because
he
concedes
two
doesn't,
isn't
to
be
read
with
all
of
them.
now
this
court
said
that
had
to
be
read
with
six
in
pitney.
he
says,
that
that
isn't
the
status
quo
provision
after
the
major
dispute
is
arisen.
but
he
says
these
three
have
to
be
read
together
and
he
gets
some
comfort
from
the
language
of
5
and
10.
now,
i
don't
understand
what
comfort
he
gets
from
10,
indeed
5,
but
10
says
that
after
emergency
board
has
been
appointed
for
30
days
after
the
reports
to
the
president,
no
change
shall
be
made
in
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose
and
i
think
the
conditions
out
of
which
this
dispute
arises
is
that
under
existing
agreements,
we
have
the
right
to
establish
an
outline
point
and
they
want
to
take
it
away
from
us
and
they
proposed
that
change
and
it
is
that's
what
shouldn't
be
changed.
well,
that
means
that
our
rights
under
the
existing
agreement
shouldn't
be
changed
for
this
period.
now,
5
provides
that
after
the
mediation
board
releases
the
dispute
for
30
days,
there
shall
be
no
change
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
working
conditions
or
working
conditions
or
established
practices.
there
is
little
to
indicate
the
reason
for
the
introduction
of
established
practices.
we've
done
a
textual
analysis
which
there
isn't
time
for
an
oral
argument,
but
i
think
i
can
point
this
out
that
that
was
introduced
in
the
34th
amendment
and
eastman
who
drafted
the
34th
amendment
said
that
this
was
merely
the
plug
a
loophole
which
theretofore
existed.
prior
to
that
when
mediation
was
terminated,
the
railroads
would
go
in
immediately
and
affected
their
changes
even
though
later
an
emergency
board
might
be
established.
and
he
said
the
only
purpose
of
this
is
to
hold
it
long
enough
to
give
the
president
the
opportunity
to
establish
an
emergency
board.
certainly,
--
mr.

i
would
because
this

squarely
so
held
in

mr.

i
would

no
because
i
think
that
was
so
held
in
williams.
mr.

yes,
they
may
exercise
those
rights
that
they
then
have.
mr.

one
subject
to
section
6
procedures.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
we're
not
raising
here
the
issue
that
this
was
purely
a
matter
of
managerial
discretion.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
it
wasn't
but
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
so
far
as
the
argument
here
is
concerned
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
but
remember,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
the
railroad
industry,
there
is
enhancement
for
a
very
long
time
detailed
rules
and
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
also
have
this
in
mind
that
very
often,
there
will
be
a
controversy
and
it
will
be
allowed
to
drop
if
there
were
a
decision
which
required
that
every
right
the
railroad
had
had
to
be
in
that
agreement,
you'd
compromise
the
possibilities
of
reaching
agreements
very
largely
indeed.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
it's
entitled
to
honor
existing
agreements,
i
should
say,
certainly
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
go
in
and
build
it.
there's
one
other
point
by
respondent
--
there's
one
other
point
which
i
like
just
to
touch
on
before
concluding
and
that
is
this.
opposing
counsel
has
raised
in
this
court,
he
didn't
plead
it,
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court,
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
raises
it
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
he
urges
that
under
our
obligation
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
under
the
2
(1)
of
the
act,
we
are
barred
from
taking
unilateral
action
as
to
any
matter
which
is
a
subject
of
discussion
under
--
which
is
a
subject
to
discussion
in
the
negotiations
and
he
relies
on
fibreboard
and
katz.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
if
the
court
was
going
to
get
into
this
area,
i
would
suppose
they
would
want
the
considered
views
of
the
court
below
and
they
haven't
those
views
because
the
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
below.
secondly,
this
court
has
warned
against
importing
these
provisions
of
the
lmra
into
the
--
and
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
specific
provisions
from
railway
labor
act
dealing
with
the
problem
of
status
quo.
but
finally,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
two
cases
are
wholly
in
apposite
in
any
event,
i
think
all
this
court
held
in
fibreboard,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
was
that
contracting
out
work
in
the
certain
instances
of
that
case,
where
the
contracting
out
was
going
to
discharge
all
them
and
destroy
the
union.
contracting
out
of
that
work
was
a
mandatorily
bargainable
issue
that
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
and
that
the
labor
board
didn't
abuse
its
discretion
in
fashion
of
the
remedy
it
did
and
that
is
no
complement
to
that
kind
here.
you
talked
to
them
for
five
years
about
it.
secondly,
and
there's
nothing
irreversible
about
this
action
which
has
been
taken
here.
secondly,
as
to
katz,
if
i
read
katz
correctly,
what
katz
holds
is
that
you
can't
--
there
was
a
proposal
for
increase
of
wages,
proposals
as
to
merit
increases,
proposals
as
to
sick
leave,
you
can't
when
you're
in
a
process
of
negotiation,
i
think
go
directly
to
the
man
and
offer
them
something
without
giving
the
union
notice
and
without
discussing
it
with
the
union.
now,
katz
said,
however,
if
understand
expressly,
from
the
statement
of
the
question
by
reference
to
the
bradley
case
and
the
landis
case,
said
expressly
that
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
case
for
instance
where
the
unions
demanded
a
16-cent
raise,
the
company
has
offered
10,
the
union
rejected
it
and
the
company
then
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
it
and
do
give
it,
that
did
not
involve
any
validation.
i
don't
see
that
you
have
any,
there's
anything
apposite
about
that
opinion
here
because
there
has
been
a
lengthy
discussions,
we
let
them
know
about
it
and
we
try
to
work
out
the
arrangements
for
bunkhouse
etcetera
with
them.
there's
nothing
here
that
can
be
urged.
there's
an
undercutting
of
the
union.
there's
a
as
going
behind
the
bargaining
agent
to
go
directly
to
the
men.
if
the
court
please,
that's
our
submission
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
unless
the
court
has
questions
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
parties
to
this
case
are
detroit
and
toledo
shore
line
which
i
shall
refer
to
shore
line
and
utu
which
is
a
merger
of
four
operating
unions,
i
shall
refer
to
it
including
the
firemen's

i
shall
to

this
case
arises
under
the
railway
labor
act.
as
your
honors
are
well
aware,
there
are
two
kinds
of
disputes
that
arise
under
that
act.
the
so-called
minor
disputes
which
involve
the
interpretation
or
application
of
the
existing
agreements
and
they
follow
the
course
of
negotiation
and
if
that
fails,
compulsory
arbitration
before
an
adjustment
board
whose
decisions
are
final
and
binding
on
the
parties.
and
then
there's
the
major
dispute
involving
not
the
interpretation
or
application
of
existing
agreements,
but
the
making
or
changing
of
existing
agreements
and
these
follow
a
different
course.
section
6
notice
proposing
a
change
is
served
as
negotiation,
mediation
and
proffer
of
arbitration
in
the
discretion
of
the
president's
appointment
of
an
emergency
board
and
then
the
parties
are
free
to
exercise
self-help
at
the
end
of
that
route.
in
this
case,
an
adjustment
board
determined
that
there
was
nothing
in
existing
agreements
which
precluded
shore
line
from
establishing
an
outlying
reporting
point,
the
point
at
which
a
fireman
might
be
required
to
report
for
work
at
the
end
of
the
day
away
from
the
main
terminal.
shore
line
proposed
to
establish
such
a
point.
the
union
served
a
notice
proposing
that
the
exclusive
reporting
point
should
be
at
the
home
terminal
at
toledo.
and
the
court
below
held
that
in
virtue
of
the
mere
filing
of
that
notice
to
deprive
shore
line
of
its
right
under
the
existing
agreement
to
establish
an
outlying
terminal,
that
was
accomplished
and
they
were
deprived
of
that
right.
now,
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
shore
line
is
a
small
railroad.
it
runs
about
50
miles
from
toledo
to
detroit.
lang
yard
is
the
mainline.
the
yard
at
toledo
is
the
yard
just
south
of
detroit
called
dearoad
and
there's
one
other
geographic
point
i
have
in
mind,
that's
at
trenton
where
there's
the
edison
yard,
that's
about
35
miles
north
of
toledo.
there's
a
growing
and
large
industrial
development
at
trenton.
while
outlying
points
have
historically
been
established,
for
many
years,
trenton
was
served
by
firemen
who
reported
at
the
toledo
yard
and
took
their
--
went
with
their
engines
up
to
trenton,
did
the
switching
there,
then
went
back
to
35
miles
and
tied
up
at
toledo.
in
1961,
this
growing
industrial
development
in
the
view
of
the
railroad
required
that
they
establish
an
outlying
point
at
trenton
and
they
served
or
they
proposed
to
the
union
that
they
would
establish
an
outlying
point
at
trenton.
the
union
served
a
section
6
notice
proposing
negotiations
on
terms
or
conditions
under
which
that
outlying
assignment
should
be
established.
negotiations
were
to
had,
mediation
was
had,
proffer
of
arbitration,
finally,
the
matter
was
released.
but
at
that
time
there
was
no
strike
and
at
a
subsequent
point
the
union
withdrew
that
notice
and
there
wasn't
the
establishment
of
the
reporting
point
of
trenton.
the
alternate
year
for
switching
at
montesanto
by
shore
line
could
pass
and
they
said
we
don't
to
propose
to
establish
this
point
at
trenton.
but
in
the
meantime
late
1962
and
in
again
september
1963,
they
established
an
outlying
point
just
south
of
detroit
and
called
it
dearoad
and
on
this
occasion
the
union
pursued
the
minor
dispute
route.
it
took
it
to
an
adjustment
board
and
it
urged
that
under
existing
agreements,
and
under
their
existing
practices
shore
line
was
barred
from
establishing
this
outlying
reporting
point
at
dearoad.
the
adjustment
board
decided
against
them.
the
adjustment
board
said
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
of
agreement
which
precludes
the
establishment
at
that
point
and
i
think
it's
not
contested
that
under
the
existing
agreements
then
shore
line
was
privileged
to
establish
that
outlying
point.
they
then
proposed
again
to
establish
an
outlying
reporting
point
at
trenton
and
the
response
to
that
was
a
section
6
notice
proposing
that
the
only
point
at
which
firemen
might
be
required
to
report
would
be
the
toledo
yard.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
right
and
which
would
deny
shore
line
of
the
right
that
they
then
had
to
establish
the
outlying
points.
there
was
a
negotiation
about
this
and
that
didn't
get
anywhere.
the
union
invoked
the
issue
and
the
mediation
was
pending
at
the
time
of
this
record
was
made.
in
late
september
1966,
shore
line
being
confronted
with
the
immediate
requirement
again
switching
montesanto
with
mcclould
having
demanded
a
series
of
it,
they
posted
a
bulletin
establishing
an
outlying
assignment
at
trenton
for
trains
to
operate
in
the
switching
of
these
industrial
establishments
at
trenton.
at
that
point,
the
union
threatened
a
strike.
shore
line
sought
an
injunction
against
the
strike.
the
union
counterclaimed
for
an
injunction
against
the
establishment
of
this
outlying
point.
the
district
court
denied
the
injunction
against
the
strike,
granted
the
injunction
against
the
establishment
of
the
outlying
point.
the
court
below
affirmed
and
the
issue
is,
i
suppose,
is
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
on
certiorari
to
this
court.
now,
the
only
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
are
actually
involved
here
are
section
2
(7)
and
section
6,
the
so-called
status
quo
provision
of
section
6,
in
fact
you've
indicated
that
these
two
sections
have
to
be
read
together
and
may
i
read
them
to
you.
the
first
appears
on
section
2
(a),
page
2
(a)
of
our
brief
and
that
section
2
(7)
which
reads
as
follows:
“no
carrier,
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
or
in
section
6
of
the
act.”
now,
i
think
there's
no
contest
about
the
fact
that
that
bars
only
a
change
in
the
existing
agreements.
it
does
not
deprive
the
parties
of
the
rights
under
the
existing
agreements.
and
section
6
reads,
carriers,
that's
on
5
(a)
of
the
appendix,
“carriers
and
representative
to
the
employees
shall
give
at
least
30
days
written
notice
of
an
intended
change
in
agreements
affecting
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
with
time
and
place
in
the
beginning
of
conferences
between
representatives
of
parties
in
such
intended
change
should
be
agreed
upon
within
ten
days
after
the
receipt
of
said
notice.
that
time
should
be
within
the
30
days
provided
in
every
case
where
such
notice
of
an
intended
change
has
been
given
or
conferences
are
being
held
with
reference
thereto
of
service
of
the
mediation
board
have
been
requested
by
either
party
or
said
board
has
proffered
its
services,
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
shall
not
be
altered
by
the
carrier
until
the
controversy
has
been
finally
acted
upon
as
required
by
section
5
of
this
act
by
the
mediation
board”
etcetera.
now,
what
we
say
that
this
provision
of
section
6
means
read
together
with
section
2
is
what
this
court
said
it
meant
in
williams
against
the
terminal
company.
here's
what
the
court
said,
"the
institution
of
negotiations,"
that
is
the
filing
of
the
section
6
notice,
“the
institution
of
negotiations
for
collective
bargaining
does
not
change
the
authority
of
the
carrier.”
the
prohibitions
of
section
6,
against
change
of
wages
or
conditions
pending
bargaining
and
those
of
section
2
(7)
are
aimed
at
preventing
changes
in
conditions
previously
fixed
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
but
we
say
section
6
means
is
again
what
this
court
said
it
meant
in
order
of
railroad
conductors
against
pitney.
there
this
court
said,
2
(7)
of
the
act
provides
that
no
carrier
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules,
or
working
conditions
of
its
employees
as
a
class,
as
embodied
in
agreements
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
under
section
6
of
the
act.
section
6
as
we
have
seen
prohibits
such
change
unless
notice
is
first
given
and
its
requirements
were
otherwise
complied
with.
section
2
(10)
of
the
act
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
both
fine
and
imprisonment
for
a
carrier
willfully
that
violates
section
6.
these
sections,
these
sections
make
it
clear
that
the
only
conduct
which
would
violate
section
6
is
a
change
of
those
working
conditions
which
are
embodied
in
agreements.
now,
what
we
think
it
means
is
also
what
the
mediation
board
has
consistently
interpreted
as
meaning.
since
1956,
the
board
repeated,
mediation
board
repeatedly
in
its
annual
reports,
in
its
instructions
to
mediate
it,
in
its
response
to
demands
of
the
unions,
repeatedly
they
have
said
this,
and
i
read
their
latest
pronouncement,
pronouncements
earlier
were
of
a
kind.
in
brief,
“the
rights
of
the
parties
which
they
had
prior
serving
the
notice
of
intention
to
change,
that's
part
of
the
serving
the
section
6
notice,
the
rights
of
the
parties
which
they
had
prior
to
serving
the
notice
of
intention
to
change
remained
the
same
during
the
period
the
proposal
is
under
consideration
and
remained
so
until
the
proposal
is
finally
acted
upon.
the
board
has
stated
in
instances
of
this
kind
that
the
serving
of
a
section
6
notice
for
a
new
rule
or
change,
a
change
in
an
existing
rule
does
not
operate,
does
not
operate
as
a
bar
to
the
carrier
actions
which
were
taken
under
rules
currently
in
effect.”
we
also
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
interpretation
which
we
give
section
6
is
the
interpretation
which
was
given
in
the
making
of
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision.
section
6,
the
initial
bill,
which
ultimately
became
in
the
subsequent
year
the
1926
act,
was
called
the
howell-barkley
bill
and
mr.
richberg
in
explaining
the
provision
that
became
section
6
from
what
was
apparently
a
prepared
text
under
the
heading
“changes
of
agreements”
had
this
to
say.
“an
agreement
that
can
be
changed
without
notice
is
really
no
agreement
at
all.
certainly,
the
power
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fear
on
the
other
of
arbitrary
change
will
read
this
court
not
harmony.”
there
is
provided
in
section
6
that
either
party
shall
give
at
least
30
days
written
notice
of
an
intended
change
and
that
the
time
and
place
of
conference
shall
be
agreed
upon,
thereafter
a
change
and
it
seems
to
me
clearly
refers
back
to
the
change
proposed,
thereafter
change
is
prohibited
until
machinery
for
peaceful
adjustment
has
been
fully
utilized.
now,
if
the
court
please,
very
important,
i
think
important
practical
considerations
which
are
entitled
to
weight.
if
i
understand
the
opposing
counsel
correctly,
he
says
that
these
so-called
status
quo
provisions
briefly
applicable,
to
indeed
asserts,
simply
applicable
to
the
union
and
to
the
carrier
and
i
put
them
below
when
he
was
not
willing
to
bite
the
bullet
then
i
doubt
he
will
hear,
i
put
in
this
situation
or
these
two
situations.
one
of
the
most
cherished
rights
of
workmen
in
this
field
are
their
seniority
rights.
a
place
opens
up,
a
desirable
place,
the
man
who
has
been
there
longest
can
be
at
the
end
and
the
place
he
opens
up
than
the
man
with
the
next
greatest
seniority
can
bid
that
in
and
so
forth.
now,
the
railroads
will
suppose
serve
a
notice
saying
this
is
disrupting.
from
now
on,
we
want
to
assign
men
to
the
post
that
they
are
investigated
for.
now,
for
the
long
period,
the
intentionally
long
period
to
exhaust
the
procedures
of
the
railroad
labor
act,
are
the
seniority
right
suspended
or
to
take
another
situation
which
is
not
unusual
that
this
negotiation
of
an
agreement
for
an
increase
in
wage
is
3%
next
january,
another
2%
in
july,
another
3%
the
following
january.
they
negotiated
that
bargain
and
a
couple
of
months
later,
the
shore
line,
the
carrier
serves
notice
saying
we're
losing
money
and
we
want
to
freeze
wages.
the
length
freeze
wages
for
the
lengthy
period,
a
year,
two
years
or
more
in
which
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
being
exhausted.
now,
i
say
that
if
he
agreed
it
would
do
that.
i
can
think
of
nothing
which
would
more
be
more
disruptive
of
the
stability
of
labor
relations
or
more
frustrating
to
the
possibility
of
making
and
maintaining
agreements
in
such
a
rule.
now,
as
i
understand,
as
i
understand
his
--
the
main
thrust
of
his
argument,
it
is
that
while
the
provisions
of
section
5,
their
status
quo
provisions
of
5
and
10
which
are
not
applicable
to
here
because
this
is
still
in
mediation
and
those
are
only
applicable
only
after
the
mediation
has
terminated
or
after
the
emergency
board
is
appointed.
if
i
understand
the
main
thrust
of
his
argument,
it
is
that
all
of
these
provisions,
not
all,
six,
five
and
ten,
must
mean
the
same
thing,
not
two
because
he
concedes
two
doesn't,
isn't
to
be
read
with
all
of
them.
now
this
court
said
that
had
to
be
read
with
six
in
pitney.
he
says,
that
that
isn't
the
status
quo
provision
after
the
major
dispute
is
arisen.
but
he
says
these
three
have
to
be
read
together
and
he
gets
some
comfort
from
the
language
of
5
and
10.
now,
i
don't
understand
what
comfort
he
gets
from
10,
indeed
5,
but
10
says
that
after
emergency
board
has
been
appointed
for
30
days
after
the
reports
to
the
president,
no
change
shall
be
made
in
the
conditions
out
of
which
the
dispute
arose
and
i
think
the
conditions
out
of
which
this
dispute
arises
is
that
under
existing
agreements,
we
have
the
right
to
establish
an
outline
point
and
they
want
to
take
it
away
from
us
and
they
proposed
that
change
and
it
is
that's
what
shouldn't
be
changed.
well,
that
means
that
our
rights
under
the
existing
agreement
shouldn't
be
changed
for
this
period.
now,
5
provides
that
after
the
mediation
board
releases
the
dispute
for
30
days,
there
shall
be
no
change
in
rates
of
pay,
rules,
working
conditions
or
working
conditions
or
established
practices.
there
is
little
to
indicate
the
reason
for
the
introduction
of
established
practices.
we've
done
a
textual
analysis
which
there
isn't
time
for
an
oral
argument,
but
i
think
i
can
point
this
out
that
that
was
introduced
in
the
34th
amendment
and
eastman
who
drafted
the
34th
amendment
said
that
this
was
merely
the
plug
a
loophole
which
theretofore
existed.
prior
to
that
when
mediation
was
terminated,
the
railroads
would
go
in
immediately
and
affected
their
changes
even
though
later
an
emergency
board
might
be
established.
and
he
said
the
only
purpose
of
this
is
to
hold
it
long
enough
to
give
the
president
the
opportunity
to
establish
an
emergency
board.
certainly,
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
would
because
this
courts
squarely
so
held
in
williams.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
would
say
no
because
i
think
that
was
so
held
in
williams.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
they
may
exercise
--
yes,
they
may
exercise
those
rights
that
they
then
have.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
one
subject
to
section
6
procedures.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
we're
not
raising
here
the
issue
that
this
was
purely
a
matter
of
managerial
discretion.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
it
wasn't
but
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
so
far
as
the
argument
here
is
concerned
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
but
remember,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
the
railroad
industry,
there
is
enhancement
for
a
very
long
time
detailed
rules
and
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
also
have
this
in
mind
that
very
often,
there
will
be
a
controversy
and
it
will
be
allowed
to
drop
if
there
were
a
decision
which
required
that
every
right
the
railroad
had
had
to
be
in
that
agreement,
you'd
compromise
the
possibilities
of
reaching
agreements
very
largely
indeed.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
it's
entitled
to
honor
existing
agreements,
i
should
say,
certainly
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
go
in
and
build
it.
there's
one
other
point
by
respondent
--
there's
one
other
point
which
i
like
just
to
touch
on
before
concluding
and
that
is
this.
opposing
counsel
has
raised
in
this
court,
he
didn't
plead
it,
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court,
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
raises
it
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
he
urges
that
under
our
obligation
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
under
the
2
(1)
of
the
act,
we
are
barred
from
taking
unilateral
action
as
to
any
matter
which
is
a
subject
of
discussion
under
--
which
is
a
subject
to
discussion
in
the
negotiations
and
he
relies
on
fibreboard
and
katz.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
if
the
court
was
going
to
get
into
this
area,
i
would
suppose
they
would
want
the
considered
views
of
the
court
below
and
they
haven't
those
views
because
the
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
below.
secondly,
this
court
has
warned
against
importing
these
provisions
of
the
lmra
into
the
--
and
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
specific
provisions
from
railway
labor
act
dealing
with
the
problem
of
status
quo.
but
finally,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
two
cases
are
wholly
in
apposite
in
any
event,
i
think
all
this
court
held
in
fibreboard,
if
i
read
it
correctly,
was
that
contracting
out
work
in
the
certain
instances
of
that
case,
where
the
contracting
out
was
going
to
discharge
all
them
and
destroy
the
union.
contracting
out
of
that
work
was
a
mandatorily
bargainable
issue
that
the
company
had
refused
to
bargain
and
that
the
labor
board
didn't
abuse
its
discretion
in
fashion
of
the
remedy
it
did
and
that
is
no
complement
to
that
kind
here.
you
talked
to
them
for
five
years
about
it.
secondly,
and
there's
nothing
irreversible
about
this
action
which
has
been
taken
here.
secondly,
as
to
katz,
if
i
read
katz
correctly,
what
katz
holds
is
that
you
can't
--
there
was
a
proposal
for
increase
of
wages,
proposals
as
to
merit
increases,
proposals
as
to
sick
leave,
you
can't
when
you're
in
a
process
of
negotiation,
i
think
go
directly
to
the
man
and
offer
them
something
without
giving
the
union
notice
and
without
discussing
it
with
the
union.
now,
katz
said,
however,
if
understand
expressly,
from
the
statement
of
the
question
by
reference
to
the
bradley
case
and
the
landis
case,
said
expressly
that
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
case
for
instance
where
the
unions
demanded
a
16-cent
raise,
the
company
has
offered
10,
the
union
rejected
it
and
the
company
then
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
it
and
do
give
it,
that
did
not
involve
any
validation.
i
don't
see
that
you
have
any,
there's
anything
apposite
about
that
opinion
here
because
there
has
been
a
lengthy
discussions,
we
let
them
know
about
it
and
we
try
to
work
out
the
arrangements
for
bunkhouse
etcetera
with
them.
there's
nothing
here
that
can
be
urged.
there's
an
undercutting
of
the
union.
there's
a
as
going
behind
the
bargaining
agent
to
go
directly
to
the
men.
if
the
court
please,
that's
our
submission
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
unless
the
court
has
questions
--
