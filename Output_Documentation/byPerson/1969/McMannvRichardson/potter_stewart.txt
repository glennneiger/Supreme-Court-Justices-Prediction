justice
potter
stewart
is
it
clear
that
each
one
of
these
cases
there
was
in
fact
a
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just
an
allegation?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
i
guess
the
--
your
counsel
on
the
other
side
agrees
that
it's
up
that
at
any
hearing,
it's
incumbent
upon
the
petitioner
to
show
that
there
was
a
confession
and
that
confession
was
coerced
and
what
if
i
suppose
always
within
the
power
of
the
states
there
was
or
wasn't
a
confession
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
up
to
the
state
to
verify,
it's
up
to
the
petitioner
to
prove
it,
isn't
it,
that
there
was
one
and
that
it
was
coerced.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anyway
of
knowing
whether
police
departments
or
district
attorney's
offices
and
so
on
keep
the
--
keep
the
files
of
cases
that
have
lost
since
been
dispose
off?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
your
problem,
that's
not
the
state's
problem,
that's
the
petitioner's
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
the
nuisance
to
have
hearings,
but
this
particular
problem,
it's
the
petitioner's
problem
because
he
has
the
burden
of
proof,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
just
mere
assertion
would
be
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
statement
have
to
meet,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
it
to
be
the
theory
of
the
second
circuit
that
a
plea
substantially
motivated
by
the
existence
of
the
involuntary
confession
is
an
involuntary
plea?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that
whether
or
not
an
involuntary
plea
it's
voidable
even
though
voluntary
if
it
was
substantially
motivated
by
the
involuntary
confession.
that
maybe
just
a
matter
of
semantics,
but
it
maybe
of
some
importance
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understood
the
rationale
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
prompted
my
question
further
on.
justice
potter
stewart
the
existence
of
the
confession.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
plea
itself
was
a
voluntary
plea
under
the
normal
conventional
standards
of
what's
a
voluntary
plea,
i.e.,
a
knowing,
intelligent,
informed
plea
with
the
advice
of
counsel
and
etcetera.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
rationale.
justice
potter
stewart
and
judge
kaufman
as
i
understand
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
thought
that
these
decisions
were
limited
to
pre-jackson-denno
situation,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
view,
at
least
his
view
was
that
these
decisions
were
so
limited
to
pre-jackson-denno
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
nexus,
mr.
juviler,
a
connection,
a
connection
or
what
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
theory
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
particular
word
to
you.
you
find
that
scattered
through
the
opinion
to
this
court
particularly
those
of
justice
frankfurter,
but
the
latin
word
you
mean
connection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
reason
i'm
asking
you
what
do
you
mean
by
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
definition
you
find
in
the
dictionary
for
nexus.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
mean
such
in
nexus,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
word
nexus
--
justice
potter
stewart
connection,
doesn't
it
mean
connection?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
does
it
mean
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
submitted
at
the
court
of
appeals,
federal
court
of
appeals
level?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
corrected
vice
today
in
new
york,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
corrected
vice
today
in
new
york
as
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
on
the
basis
before
he
had
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
claim
made
here
that
the
--
that
the
confession
was
made
after
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
so
therefore,
it
would
not
only
be
the
claim
that
is
not
a
coerced
confession,
but
also
one
that's
inadmissible
because
it
violates
the
new
york
rule
that
antedated
the
messiah
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
leave
the
business
of
what
would
be
incompetence
then
involve
in
the
hearings,
in
the
hearings
that
have
been
now
ordered
under
the
court
of
appeals
directives?
wouldn't
it
be
enough
for
the
petitioners
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof
to
say
well,
yes
i
confessed
and
in
my
opinion
and
in
my
view
that
was
coerced
confession
and
that's
what
motivated
my
plea
of
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
he
knows
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
what
motivated
his
plea
of
guilty,
doesn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
motivated
it
and
it
is
pretty
hard
to
disprove
it,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
he
says,
“yes,
i
confessed
orally
to
a
policeman
only
because
he
was
beating
me
with
his
club
above
my
head
and
this
did
happen
and
i
did
confess
orally
and
that's
the
reason
i
pleaded
guilty.”
and
then
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
as
far
us
we
can
see
that
there
never
was
a
confession
of
any
kind,
coerced
or
un-coerced.
it
doesn't
necessarily
disprove
this
case,
does
it?
he
says
it
happened
and
that
he
did
confess
and
that
it
was
a
confession
that
was
beaten
out
of
him
and
that's
the
reason,
the
only
reason
or
the
substantially
motivating
reason
that
induced
his
plea
of
guilty,
hasn't
he
proved
his
case?
even
though
the
state
says,
we
can
find
any
confession
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
now
a
petitioner,
not
a
defendant
and
he
comes
in
and
he
--
unlike
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
the
petitioner
does
have
the
burden
of
proof.
so
we're
talking
about
petitioner
on
this
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
--
all
right,
just
change
the
situation
a
little
bit
and
say
that
it
is
shown
that
there
was
a
confession
which
was
arguably
a
coerced
confession.
and
then,
the
state
comes
back
and
says,
yes
but
we
have
this
and
the
petitioner
says,
and
that's
the
reason
i
pleaded
guilty,
this
motivating
reason
and
the
sole
reason.
the
state
responds,
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case
and
said
yes
but
we
have
this
eight
eyewitnesses.
can
the
petitioner
say,
well,
i
didn't
know
if
there
any
eyewitnesses
that
wasn't
my
reason.
i
did
this
because
of
the
coerced
confession.
i
didn't
know
about
eyewitnesses.
so
the
state
showing
that
if
there
were
in
fact
eight
doesn't
defend
against
his
claim,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
up
against
the
very
concrete
situation
here
and
i'm
just
asking
what
kind
of
a
hearing
this
is
going
to
be
or
many
hundreds
of
hearings?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
have
to
show
that
the
petitioner
knew
of
all
those
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
sufficient
for
the
state
to
show
that
there
were
eight
eyewitnesses.
it
has
to
show
that
the
petitioner
knew
there
were
eight
eyewitnesses.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
theory
--
that's
the
theory
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeal,
isn't
it?
the
confession
has
to
be
shown
to
have
been
motivated
by
the
existence
of
a
--
the
plea
has
to
be
shown
to
have
been
motivated
by
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession
and
that
has
to
do
with
subjective
motivation,
so
you
have
to
show
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
petitioner
and
what
he
had
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
plea,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
old
standard
was
is
this
plea
voluntary
or
involuntary
the
plea
of
guilty?
i'm
not
talking
about
any
confession.
is
this
plea
of
guilty
voluntary
or
involuntary
and
generally
speaking
the
test
has
been
was
it
made
intelligently,
informingly
and
with
the
advice
of
counsel,
by
a
man
competent
to
make
it?
now,
that's
been
a
general
test,
conventionally,
is
that
correct
or
am
i
all
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
exactly
that's
where
the
horse
is
buried,
what
is
voluntary?
now,
here
the
new
thing
about
these
cases
is
as
i
understand
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
now
said
even
though
a
plea
is
made
voluntarily
according
to
the
conventional
test,
with
all
the
information
of
the
facts
with
the
advice
the
counsel,
by
a
man
competent,
nonetheless
it
could
be
set
aside
if
it
were
substantially
motivated
by
the
existence
of
an
involuntary
confession.
have
i
misread
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
those
other
cases,
at
least
the
ones
which
i'm
familiar,
were
posted
on
the
proposition
that
the
coercion
continued
up
to
and
through
the
time
of
the
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
presenting
quite
different
thing
than
a
voluntary
plea
made
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
confession
it
can
be
set
aside.
justice
potter
stewart
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
good
advice,
didn't
it,
so
far
as
the
second
circuit
held?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
have
mattered.
justice
potter
stewart
each
one
and
then
there
was,
richardson
as
i
understand
it
turned
down
the
original
offer
of
the
guilty
plea,
opportunity
to
plead
guilty
to
the
greater
charge
and
he
negotiated
plea
was,
a
bargain
was
then
made
that
he
plead
guilty
to
lesser
your
charge,
lesser,
lesser
degree
of
the
same
offense,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anywhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
due
process
of
law.
what
you
can't
permit
is
the
admission
of
a
coerced
confession
in
the
court
of
law
of
criminal
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
assume
that
a
state
was
going
to
use
evidence
of
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
i
should
think
the
presumption
would
have
to
be
the
other
way,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
know
how
many
cases
there
may
have
been
when
they
didn't
because
that
would
never
be
a
matter
of
record.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
larceny
or
burglary?
justice
potter
stewart
robbery
under
the
statutory.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
in
new
york
city
or
the
state,
is
that
buffalo
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
richardson
i
thought
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
northern
district?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
where
he
was
incarcerated.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
clear
that
each
one
of
these
cases
there
was
in
fact
a
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just
an
allegation?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
i
guess
the

that

justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
your
problem,
that's
not
the
state's
problem,
that's
the
petitioner's
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
the
nuisance
to
have
hearings,
but
this
particular
problem,
it's
the
petitioner's
problem
because
he
has
the

because

of

and
i'm
not
quite

i
understood
the

that
prompted
my
question
further
on.
justice

stewart
the

even

what
do
you
mean
by

mr.

or
what

justice

i'm

you

that's
reason
i'm

what
do

justice

stewart
that's
not
a

you

justice

i
don't
mean
such
in

what
do
you
mean
by

nexus
--
justice
potter
stewart
connection,
doesn't
it
mean

justice
potter
stewart
but
what
does
it
mean
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
submitted
at
the
court
of
appeals,
federal
court
of
appeals
level?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
corrected
vice
today
in

wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
corrected
vice
today
in
new
york
as
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
on
the
basis
before
he
had
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
claim
made
here
that
the
--
that
the

justice

so
therefore,
it

that's

why
not?
justice

he

better

anybody
else
in
the
world
what
motivated
his
plea

guilty,
doesn't
he?
justice

stewart
(voice

motivated
it
and
it
is
pretty

isn't

above
my
head
and
this
did
happen
and
i
did
confess
orally
and
that's
the
reason
i
pleaded
guilty.”
and
then
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
as
far
us
we
can
see
that
there
never
was
a
confession
of
any
kind,
coerced
or
un-coerced.
it
doesn't
necessarily
disprove
this
case,
does
it?
he
says
it
happened
and
that
he
did
confess
and
that
it
was
a
confession
that
was
beaten
out
of
him
and
that's
the
reason,
the
only
reason
or
the
substantially
motivating
reason
that
induced
his
plea
of
guilty,
hasn't
he
proved
his
case?
even
though
the
state
says,
we
can
find
any
confession
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he's
now
a
petitioner,
not
a
defendant
and
he
comes
in
and
he
--
unlike
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
the
petitioner
does
have
the
burden
of
proof.
so
we're
talking
about
petitioner
on
this
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
--
all
right,
just
change
the
situation
a
little
bit
and
say
that
it
is
shown
that
there
was
a
confession
which
was
arguably
a
coerced
confession.
and
then,
the
state
comes
back
and
says,
yes
but
we
have
this
and
the
petitioner
says,
and
that's
the
reason
i
pleaded
guilty,
this
motivating
reason
and
the
sole
reason.
the
state
responds,
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case
and
said
yes
but
we
have
this
eight
eyewitnesses.
can
the
petitioner
say,
well,
i
didn't
know
if
there
any
eyewitnesses
that
wasn't
my
reason.
i
did
this
because
of
the
coerced
confession.
i
didn't
know
about
eyewitnesses.
so
the
state
showing
that
if
there
were
in
fact
eight
doesn't
defend
against
his
claim,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
up
against
the
very
concrete
situation
here
and
i'm
just
asking
what
kind
of
a
hearing
this
is
going
to
be
or
many
hundreds
of
hearings?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
have
to
show
that
the
petitioner
knew
of
all
those
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
sufficient
for
the
state
to
show
that
there
were
eight
eyewitnesses.
it
has
to
show
that
the
petitioner
knew
there
were
eight
eyewitnesses.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
theory
--
that's
the
theory
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeal,
isn't
it?
the
confession
has
to
be
shown
to
have
been
motivated
by
the
existence
of
a
--
the
plea
has
to
be
shown
to
have
been
motivated
by
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession
and
that
has
to
do
with
subjective
motivation,
so
you
have
to
show
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
petitioner
and
what
he
had
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
plea,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
old
standard
was
is
this
plea
voluntary
or
involuntary
the
plea
of
guilty?
i'm
not
talking
about
any
confession.
is
this
plea
of
guilty
voluntary
or
involuntary
and
generally
speaking
the
test
has
been
was
it
made
intelligently,
informingly
and
with
the
advice
of
counsel,
by
a
man
competent
to
make
it?
now,
that's
been
a
general
test,
conventionally,
is
that
correct
or
am
i
all
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
exactly
that's
where
the
horse
is
buried,
what
is
voluntary?
now,
here
the
new
thing
about
these
cases
is
as
i
understand
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
now
said
even
though
a
plea
is
made
voluntarily
according
to
the
conventional
test,
with
all
the
information
of
the
facts
with
the
advice
the
counsel,
by
a
man
competent,
nonetheless
it
could
be
set
aside
if
it
were
substantially
motivated
by
the
existence
of
an
involuntary
confession.
have
i
misread
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
those
other
cases,
at
least
the
ones
which
i'm
familiar,
were
posted
on
the
proposition
that
the
coercion
continued
up
to
and
through
the
time
of
the
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
presenting
quite
different
thing
than
a
voluntary
plea
made
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
confession
it
can
be
set
aside.
justice
potter
stewart
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
good
advice,
didn't
it,
so
far
as
the
second
circuit
held?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
have
mattered.
justice
potter
stewart
each
one
and
then
there
was,
richardson
as
i
understand
it
turned
down
the
original
offer
of
the
guilty
plea,
opportunity
to
plead
guilty
to
the
greater
charge
and
he
negotiated
plea
was,
a
bargain
was
then
made
that
he
plead
guilty
to
lesser
your
charge,
lesser,
lesser
degree
of
the
same
offense,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anywhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
due
process
of
law.
what
you
can't
permit
is
the
admission
of
a
coerced
confession
in
the
court
of
law
of
criminal
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
assume
that
a
state
was
going
to
use
evidence
of
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
i
should
think
the
presumption
would
have
to
be
the
other
way,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
know
how
many
cases
there
may
have
been
when
they
didn't
because
that
would
never
be
a
matter
of
record.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
larceny
or
burglary?
justice
potter
stewart
robbery
under
the
statutory.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
in
new
york
city
or
the
state,
is
that
buffalo
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
richardson
i
thought
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
northern
district?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
where
he
was
incarcerated.
