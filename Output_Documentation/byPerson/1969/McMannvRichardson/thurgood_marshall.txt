justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
a
guilty
plea,
how
can
you
ever
get
to
the
whether
the
confession
is
coerced
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
there
is
a
coerced
confession
and
for
some
reason
the
lawyer
and
the
defendant
both
say
there's
no
use
in
taking
a
chance,
that's
it.
nobody
can
handle
it
in
terms.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
there
is
a
coerced
confession
and
a
trial
and
the
conviction
and
later
on
you
can
get
objection
then
or
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
is
being
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
the
police
officers
identify
the
man
and
they
know
they're
wrong
and
if
they
beat
a
confession
out
of
it,
i'm
not
even
assuming
that
this
case,
and
yet
the
lawyer
tells,
“look,
they're
going
to
believe
that
police
officer
and
they're
not
going
to
believe
you
and
he
pleads
guilty,
that's
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
that
this
hearing
that
the
second
circuit
had
ordered,
it
found
there
were
no
confessions,
the
conviction
stands?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
court
finds
that
there
were
confessions,
they
were
perfectly
legal
the
conviction
stands.
if
they
find
that
the
confession
was
extorted
by
force
and
violence
or
what
have
you
then
they
will
more
than
likely
set
aside
the
conviction
and
let's
go
again.
outside
of
the
problems
and
difficulties
of
holding
hearings
which
are
normal
what
else
is
wrong
with
that
as
a
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
jackson
and
denno
are
on
at
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
come
out
in
the
hearing
that
the
second
circuit
proposes,
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
judge
kaufman
slow
you
down
a
little
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
was
perjured
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
if
there
were
perjured
testimony
by
a
police
officer
and
as
a
result
of
that
and
for
no
other
reason,
a
man
can't
take
a
chance
that
he
is
still
convicted
and
there
is
no
way
to
reach
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
pleadings
that
says,
that
new
york
state
was
going
to
use
that
alleged
confession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
sought
the
kind
of
burden,
aren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
what
constitutional
right
was
violated
when
that
policeman
beat
him
up?
let's
assume
that
he
did.
what
constitutional
right
was
violated
at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true
that
it
doesn't
become
a
constitutional
right
unless
when
it's
presented
as
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
right
was
violated
when
they
beat
him
up
to
get
a
confession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
have
the
policeman
convicted
or
you
can
sue
him
for
damages
but
what
constitutional
right
is
violated
if
the
state
never
uses
the
alleged
confession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
past
statement
that
he
did
kill
the
woman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
what
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
he
went,
you
say
the
court
has
went
that
far,
he
said
on
the
other
day,
yes
i'm
guilty
and
everything
but
then
he
says
to
a
specific
crime
and
he
says
yes,
i
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
not
dealing
with
use
in
that
statement
except
in
a
colloquy
between
you
and
me.
couldn't
he
have
said
when
he
said
did
you
kill
this
woman,
could
he
have
said
no?
he's
admitted
guilt
to
the
crime
and
everything
else
but
he
had
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could
have
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
happened.
the
judge
still
could
have
accepted
the
plea,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
he
could've.
so,
even
he
assumed
that
all
of
the
other
was
or
one
side
then
this
is
on
the
other
side,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
your
submission
be
in
trouble
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
if
i
can
put
it
in
two
compartments,
if
i
can?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
true
that
about
what
percentage
of
your
people
that
come
to
legal
aid
complain
about
ineffective
counsel,
including
legal
aid,
what
percentage,
about
90,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
petitions
filed
in
the
southern
district
about
how
many
complains
ineffective
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
and
if
in
order
to
sustain
your
position,
do
we
have
to
say
that
charge
of
ineffective
counsel
of
itself
will
get
this
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
was
told
to
any
judge
in
new
york
state,
he
would
have
given
a
continuance?
is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
new
york.
certainly,
a
judge
wouldn't
call
someone
into
trial
who
haven't
seen
his
lawyer
more
than
ten
minutes.
you're
not
going
to
say
that,
aren't
you?
force
him
to
try?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
litigated
in
new
york
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
litigated
into
post-conviction
in
new
york
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
alleged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
believe
it
but
is
it
here
in
the

is
it
here
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
the
papers
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
could
have,
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
make
any
effort
to
get
that?
justice
thurgood

so,
if
we
want
to
see
it,
we'll
have
to
go
find
to
