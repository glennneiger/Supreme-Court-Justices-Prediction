justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
proceedings
at
the
time
that
the
pleas
are
taken
in
the
record
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
that
on
the
issue
we
have
to
deal
with
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
know
what
happen
at
the
court
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
richardson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
any
of
these
printed
papers
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
don't
--
don't
stop
to
that,
i
look
at
it.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
does
this
contemplate
also
an
inquiry
into
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
there
has
to
be
a
nexus
though
between
the
confession
and
the
plea,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
then,
what
you
meant
when
you
said
ms.
soloff,
a
substantial,
a
substantial
factor
in
the
making
of
the
plea,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
that's
mean
nexus
doesn't
it
between
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
was
my
question.
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
kind
of
nexus
between
alleged
coerced
confession
and
the
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
the
premise
that
it's
a
coerced
confession.
i
thought
that
the
attack
under
the
plea
depended
upon
showing
that
the
plea
was
a
consequence
of
the
coerced
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
not
have
made
the
plea,
but
for
my
fear
that
this
confession
were
successfully
used
against
me
i
come
off
worse
than
i
would
by
pleading
guilty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
oberman,
may
i
ask?
is
this
to
say
then
that
if
this
hearing
goes
forward,
this
is
in
the
dash
case
now,
not
the
richardson
case.
dash
is
where
there's
been
no
allegation
of
incompetent
counsel,
and
it
is
established
by
dash
that
indeed
the
confession
was
beaten
out
off
him.
then
are
you
suggesting
that
any
advice
of
counsel
because
he
was
represented
by
counsel
then
becomes
irrelevant
to
his
right
to
relief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
relevancy
of
advice
to
counsel
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excuse
mrs.
oberman,
let's
take
a
concrete
hypothetical.
suppose
in
fact
what
counsel
did
was
to
say,
now
you
say
this
was
beaten
out
of
you
and
you
have
some
corroborating
proofs
that
it
was
beaten
out
of
you.
how
about
there
were
two
police
officers
involved
and
there's
going
to
be
a
question
of
credibility
because
those
officers
are
going
to
deny
that
they
beat
it
out
of
you
and
your
witnesses
are
going
to
say
they
did
and
there's
always
a
chance
that
being
a
fact
question
that
the
issue
of
credibility
will
be
resolved
in
favor
officers'
story.
therefore,
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
that
should
happen,
now
you
may
go
to
electric
chair
and
the
better
thing
for
you
to
do
under
circumstances
then
is
to
plead
guilty
if
we
can
get
a
second
degree
plea.
now,
suppose
that's
--
those
are
the
facts
as
to
the
advice
that
his
counsel
gave
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
quite
the
question
i
put
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
at
now
is
the
reasons
you
told
me,
initially
a
hearing
on
the
--
whether
or
not
the
confession
is
coerced
and
it
is
decided
factually
that
the
officers
testify
and
i'm
speaking
now
with
the
habeas
hearing
and
here
were
the
issue
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
they
said
yes
it
was
coerced
and
yet
the
counsel
had
said
to
him
at
the
time
before
he
pleaded
guilty,
these
are
the
chances
that
we
take.
this
is
an
issue
of
credibility
and
if
you
go
to
trial
and
maybe
resolved
against
you.
does
that
--
does
that
defeat,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
so
that's
what
develops.
notwithstanding
the
finding
at
this
habeas
hearing
is
that
the
police
did
beat
it
out
of
him,
it
was
coerced,
but
counsel
has
just
told
him
what
the
chances
were
before
he
pleaded
guilty
and
he
then
pleaded
guilty,
would
you
think
he'd
entitled
to
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
would
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he's
not
entitled
to
relief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
the
confession
is
in
my
hypothetical
is
not
in
the
sense
of
what's
involved
he's
getting
advice
from
the
lawyer
whether
or
not
he
should
take
the
chance
on
the
issue
of
credibility
as
it
bears
on
his
claim
of
coerced
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he
was
--
the
lawyer
called
in
frankly
as
i
would
expect
any
good
lawyer
would.
now,
look
this
is
going
whether
of
not
a
confession
is
beaten
out,
it
just
going
to
turn
on
whether
the
fact
finder
believes
you
and
your
witnesses
or
believes
police
and
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
that
we
go
to
trial
on
this
and
they
believe
--
the
fact
finder
believes
the
police
you
may
end
up
in
the
electric
chair
and
i
think
you
better
not
take
that
chance
you
just
better
plead
to
second
degree
if
we
can
get
such
a
plea.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
i
want
to
get
very
clear.
at
least
it's
not
your
position
that
the
second
circuit
has
said
that
a
finding
at
the
hearing
it
has
ordered
that
a
confession
was
coerced
in
and
of
itself,
entitles
the
petitioner
to
have
this
conviction
on
the
guilty
plea
set
aside.
that's
not
your
position,
you
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
proceedings
at
the
time
that
the
pleas
are
taken
in
the
record
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
that
on
the
issue
we
have
to
deal
with
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
know
what
happen
at
the
court
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
richardson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
any
of
these
printed
papers
or
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
don't
--
don't
stop
to
that,
i
look
at
it.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
--
does
this
contemplate
also
an
inquiry
into
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
there
has
to
be
a
nexus
though
between
the
confession
and
the
plea,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
then,
what
you
meant
when
you
said
ms.
soloff,
a
substantial,
a
substantial
factor
in
the
making
of
the
plea,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
that's
mean
nexus
doesn't
it
between
the
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
was
my
question.
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
kind
of
nexus
between
alleged
coerced
confession
and
the
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
the
premise
that
it's
a
coerced
confession.
i
thought
that
the

under

i
would

but
for
my
fear
that
this

were
successfully

against
me
i
come
off
worse
than
i
would
by
pleading
guilty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
oberman,
may
i
ask?
is
this
to
say
then
that
if
this
hearing
goes
forward,
this
is
in
the
dash
case
now,
not
the

then
becomes

justice
william

well,
what
is
the
relevancy
of

then?
justice
william
j.
