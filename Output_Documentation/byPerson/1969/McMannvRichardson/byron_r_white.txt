justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
that
you
disagree
with
the
richardson
case
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
defendant
alleges
and
makes
a
specific
allegation
incompetence
of
counsel
in
advising
him
about
how
to
plead?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
--
how
would
you
attack
the
plea
of
guilty
using
that?
what
would
you
say?
do
you
say
i
had
an
incompetent
and
ineffective
counsel
and
therefore
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right,
right,
but
what
if
the
counsel
says
or
what
if
the
allegation
is
that
i
told
the
counsel
that
i
was
beaten
and
he
says
it
doesn't
make
difference
if
you
were
beaten
at
all,
your
confession
is
admissible
and
with
the
confession,
you're
cooked?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
he
said
--
he
attacks
his
counsel
on
the
ground
that
the
counsel
said
that
confession
is
usable
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
he
said,
he
was
beaten?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
advice
any
client
you
had
that
if
confession
that
would
be
out
of
you
was
usable
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
allegation
was
that
that
it
was
represented
to
my
counsel
and
then
to
me
that
a
co-conspirator
or
co-defendant
had
confessed
and
implicated
me
and
would
testify
against
me,
and
that
was
false,
absolutely
false.
the
state
made
the
representation
that
was
a
false
representation
and
i
wouldn't
have
pleaded
except
for
this
fear
of
having
the
testimony
used
against
me
and
with
that
testimony
i
had
no
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
would
you
say
that
that
the
plea
was
not
intelligently
made
then,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean,
you
were
operating
on
a
false
premise.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
set
the
guilty
plea
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
in
the
second
circuit
he
could?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
whether
in
new
york
now
there
maybe
a
pre-trial
hearing
about
the
admissibility
of
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
and
if
the
upper
court
reverses
the
decision
that
it
was
admissible,
he
may
re-plead?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
is
this
right
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
understand
--
you
don't
understand
that
that
so-called
omnibus
hearing,
pre-trial
hearing
in
some
jurisdictions
includes
a
confession
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
if
they
were
admittedly
or
clearly
coerced
confessions,
a
counsel
would've
advised
him
of
that
and
he
wouldn't
have
taken
them
in
a
consideration
in
considering
whether
to
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
oberman
could
i
interrupt
you
a
moment?
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions,
if
it
were
merely
alleged
by
a
petitioner
that
a
confession
was
coerced
from
him
and
that
that
coercion
in
that
confession
motivated
his
plea
because
he
thought
it
would
be
usable
against
him
and
that
therefore
his
guilty
plea
was
coerced.
if
those
were
the
allegations
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions
there,
he
would
be
that
the
entitled
to
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
put
aside
the
--
i
know
there
are
other
allegations
in
these
cases
but
as
i
read
their
opinions
that
even
if
there
weren't
any
allegations
of
incompetency
of
counsel,
as
long
as
he
alleged
there
was
coerced
confession
and
if
that
coerced
confession
motivated
or
caused
his
plea
and
without
the
confession
he
never
would
have
plead
guilty,
as
long
as
he
alleges
that
he
can
get
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
surely,
he
would
have
to
prove
his
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
alright.
well,
assume
he
makes
a
detailed
allegations
as
to
why
he
thinks
the
confession
was
involuntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
assume
he
says,
there
weren't
any
--
the
state
had
no
other
evidence
that
no
other
substantial
evidence
but
the
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
he
has
to
allege.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
in
richardson
you
have
the
additional
factor
of
allegations
of
incompetency
of
counsel,
don't
you,
in
connection
with
advising
the
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
win,
if
you
win,
his
advice
was
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
take
it
then
on
my
previous
question
if
he
just
alleges
the
coerced
confession
that
caused
his
plea,
he
gets
a
hearing
even
though
he
freely
concedes
that
his
counsel
was
competent.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
takes
advantage
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
did
make
incompetency
of
counsel
a
critical
matter
in
or
a
necessary
item
in
ordering
his
hearings.
it
was
the
allegation
that
the
coerced
confession
and
the
connection
between
the
confession
under
plea.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
factor
in
the
richardson
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
afraid
of
the
confession
that's
why
he
pleaded
guilty.
suppose
that
was
established
in
habeas
corpus
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
gather,
you
also
answer
that
even
if
on
the
habeas
hearing
it
shown
that
coerced
confession
was
a
major
factor
in
inducing
the
plea
that
there
would
not
be
a
relief.

byron
