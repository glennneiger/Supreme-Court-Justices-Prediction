ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
primary
things
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
because
i
feel
that
there
has
been
either
misstatement
or
confusion
about
first
of
all,
the
facts
in
the
case
and
secondly,
just
precisely
what
the
court
below
did
do
in
each
of
these
cases
and
what
it
did
not
do.
first
and
foremost,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
second
circuit
did
not
announce
a
new
rule
of
law
in
any
of
these
cases.
it
merely
reinterpreted
and
severely
limited
one
of
its
own
cases,
united
states
against
ex
rel.
glenn
against
mcmann.
now,
this
was
a
very
long
overdue
step
because
the
glenn
decision
was
at
odds
with
decisions
in
this
court
as
well
as
with
the
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeal
of
at
least
five
other
circuits.
secondly,
the
court
below
in
limiting
this
glenn
decision
acknowledged
that
under
certain
circumstances,
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession
could
coerce
a
guilty
plea.
the
surprising
thing
about
this
recognition
is
that
it
came
so
late.
but
it
cannot
be
stressed
enough
that
the
second
circuit
did
not
hold
that
the
bare
allegation
that
a
confession
was
coerced
entitles
a
habeas
petitioner
either
to
a
hearing
or
to
relief.
a
certain
specified
cause
an
effect
relationship
has
to
be
alleged
and
has
to
be
proved
and
the
cause
an
effect
relationship
varies
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
in
the
richardson
case
and
to
an
extent
in
the
williams
case,
the
reason
that
the
defendant
was
prevented
from
raising
his
confession
claim
at
trial
was
because
he
was
represented
by
counsel
who
was
incompetent
or
negligent
and
refused
to
lift
a
finger
to
help
him.
according
to
the
allegations,
now
we're
on
the
pleadings
here,
and
this
is
not
a
question
of
what
has
been
proved,
these
are
un-controverted
allegations.
in
the
dash
case,
the
cause
an
effect
relationship
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
guilty
plea
was
that
counsel
was
unable
to
do
anything
meaningful
to
prevent
the
coerced
confession
from
being
used
to
convict
the
defendant
at
trial
and
the
reason
for
this
was
jackson
against
denno
or
stein
against
new
york,
i
should
say.
the
third
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
decisions
below
do
not
automatically
call
into
question
the
validity
of
all
guilty
pleas
no
matter
how
painstaking
and
how
complete
the
colloquy
at
pleading
has
been
or
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
been
represented
by
counsel.
the
second
circuit
merely
held
i
think
virtually
every
other
court
in
the
country
that
in
certain
instances
where
you
have
off
the
record
or
allegations
of
off
the
record
facts
in
a
petition
even
a
full
colloquy
at
pleading
and
even
representation
by
counsel
do
not
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
moreover,
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
both
these
factors,
the
completeness
of
the
colloquy
and
representation
by
counsel
are
entitled
to
great
weight
in
the
ultimate
assessment
of
the
voluntaries
of
the
plea.
and
in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
circuit
held
that
both
the
belief
--
the
burden
of
pleading
that
is
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
make
a
showing
to
get
a
hearing
and
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
hearing
of
each
and
every
allegation
in
the
petition
was
upon
the
habeas
petitioner.
now,
it
must
be
also
stressed
that
each
of
these
cases
came
up
for
review
on
the
pleading
and
the
issue
for
decision
in
each
case
was
whether
the
facts
alleged
to
the
each
petition's
stated
claims
which
have
prove
at
a
hearing
either
in
state
or
federal
court
would
entitle
the
petitioners
to
relief
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
second
circuit
gave
new
york
the
option
of
holding
the
hearing
that
it
envisioned
because
the
matter
was
remitted
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
was
to
hold
the
hearing
only
if
new
york
did
not
hold
the
hearing.
in
each
case,
the
circuit
held
that
if
the
allegation
were
proved
at
a
hearing
then
pleas
in
each
case
were
involuntary
and
for
this
reason,
a
hearing
had
to
be
held.
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
state's
position
and
in
all
of
these
cases
where
they
took
the
position
because
at
least
in
one
case
no
response
was
filed
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
allegations
even
if
proved
at
a
hearing
would
not
entitle
the
respondents
to
relief.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
i
would
have
to
amplify
that
just
to
a
certain
extent.
the
circuit
in
its
burden
of
pleading
put
upon
the
petitioner
the
obligation
to
come
forward
with
whatever
affidavits
record
proof
to
so
much.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
no,
in
order
to
get
the
hearing
so
that
the
bare
allegations
as
you
have
outlined.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
if
he
made
a
colorable
showing
and
if
i
think
of
that's
the
only
way
i
can
express
it,
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that
the
confession
for
reasons
specified
was
the
factor
which
induced
his
plea
of
guilty.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
richardson,
you
have
the
factor
of
incompetency
of
counsel
which
i
think
comes
to
bear
in
two
places,
that
it
is
an
independent
ground
or
claim
for
relief
beyond
the
coerced
confession
claim
and
vis-Ã -vis
the
coerced
confession
claim,
counsel's
failure
to
investigate
and
counsel's
wrong
advice
and
it
was
clearly
wrong
under
new
york
law
and
under
federal
law
at
that
time
about
the
time
for
raising
the
confession
was
the
reason
the
nexus,
the
causal
connection.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
that's
fortuitous
circumstance
that
i
don't
think
should
have
anything
to
do
with
decision
here.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
divide
that
question
into
two
parts
and
then
answer
each
one.
i
think
that
before
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno,
if
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
competence
of
counsel,
but
there
is
the
allegation
that
the
reason
that
the
confession
issue
was
not
raised
at
trial
was
because
of
the
stein
procedure
and
all
of
the
chilling
effects
that
that
procedure
had
upon
or
the
distorting
effects
that
that
procedure
had
upon
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
guilt
determination.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
represented
by
competent
counsel
under
the
point
of
view
that
circuit
took
doesn't
preclude
him
from
a
hearing.
now,
after
jackson
against
denno,
you
have
a
different
kind
of
problem
because
as
mr.
juviler
has
pointed
out,
in
new
york
at
any
rate,
you
have
the
full
hearing
on
voluntariness
of
the
confession
that's
held
prior
to
trial,
at
that
point
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
the
other.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
and
after
jackson
against
denno
the
deterrent
effect
or
there
is
no
unconstitutional
procedure
which
could
deter
a
defendant
from
going
to
trial
on
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
but
i
believed
in
the
richardson
decision
which
was
not
an
en
banc
decision
and
a
separate
decision
in
which
one
of
the
dissenters
in
the
en
banc
wrote
the
majority.
the
connecting
factor
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
inability
to
raise
the
confession
issue
at
trial
was
--
the
allegation
of
incompetency
of
counsel
and
counsel's
mis-advise.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
but
in
dash,
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
second
circuit
that
there
was
no
allegation
of
incompetent
representation
by
counsel.
so
then
the
next
question
was,
well
if
you
have
a
claim
that
you
consider
a
valid
claim,
if
you
feel
that
your
confession
was
coerced,
you
have
competent
counsel
to
represent
you
at
trial,
you
had
your
chance
in
it,
why
didn't
you
present
that
claim
at
trial.
and
if
you
didn't
present
it
at
trial
can
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances
there
has
been
a
waiver
because
you
have
failed
to
present
the
claim
in
an
acceptable
state
procedure.
the
answer
to
that
was
stein
against
new
york
that
even
competent
counsel
before
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno
would
think
long
and
think
hard
about
taking
his
defendant
to
trial
with
a
coerced
confession
claim
under
that
procedure
and
i
cannot
stress
enough
the
detrimental
effect,
the
coercive
effect
that
that
procedure
had
both
to
counsel
and
to
a
defendant
confronted
with
a
coerced
confession
claim
and
the
possibility
of
trial
or
plea.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
the
circuit
viewed
it
in
terms
of
the
prime
motivating
factor
that
other
circuits
have
talked
about
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
taking
your
hypothetical
strictly
on
its
facts,
i
think
the
circuit
has
answered
the
question
in
its
opinion
by
saying
even
where
of
confession
is
coerced,
a
defense
counsel
may
have
--
may
properly
advise
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty,
say
if
there's
a
substantial
or
the
evidence
or
if
the
possibility
of
proving
the
claim
is
minimal
because
of
the
caliber
of
witnesses
is
in
so--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
perhaps
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
no
in
a
very
recent
case.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
and
i
would
say
no
also
under
the
decision
of
the
circuit
because
there
are
two
elements.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
there
are
two
elements
that
have
to
be
proved
not
only
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
coerced,
but
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
the
substantial,
the
prime,
the
main
motivating
force
behind
entry
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
now,
there
are
of
force
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
thought
that
your
hypothetical
was
that
he
was
not
--
well,
perhaps
i
divided
my
own
mind
a
little
bit
to
finely
not
that
he
was
a
afraid
of
the
coerced
confession
but
he
was
afraid
that
his
proof
would
not
be
accepted,
his
proof
of
coercion
would
not
be
accepted
voluntary.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
that
only
what
i
could
answer
that
question
your
honor
is
the
following.
i
believe
as
i
read
the
second
circuit
decisions
that
the
defendant
would
lose,
given
your
hypothetical
because
then
this
could
be
a
situation
possibly
were
a
lawyer
could
properly
advice
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
despite
the
confession.
i
think
that
there
are
other
courts
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
do
not
take
this
hard
and
fast
line
and
feel
that
or
have
granted
relief
in
cases
where
the
attorney
or
the
defendant
or
both
have
to
take
the
confession
into
account
as
one
factor
in
determining
the
strategy
of
whether
to
plead
or
go
to
trial
and
to
this
extent
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
guess
that
is
not
my
position
and
yes
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
if
it
--
if
it
were
a
major
factor
in
the
terms
that
the
second
circuit
has
spoken
out,
if
the
coerced
confession
were
the
prime
motivating
factor
and
not
other
kinds
of
considerations,
then
there
would
be
relief
but
i
say
that
the
second
circuit
has
taken
rather
a
hard
line
with
this
because
there
are
other
courts
which
have
granted
relief
upon
a
showing
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that
the
confession
was
the
factor
to
be
reckoned
with.
in
the
pleading
decision
i
think
that
that
i
believe
that
the
citations
to
those
cases
are
at
page
32,
footnote
29,
zachery
against
hale,
cuevas
against
rundle
and
smiley
against
wilson
where
the
courts
in
the
first
two
cases
in
granting
relief
say
that
the
court
appointed
counsel
was
forced
under
the
circumstances
to
give
some
consideration
and
weight
to
an
illegal
confession.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
possibly.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
point,
i
think
that
the
dilemma
that
you
pose
is
really
not
a
prosecution
or
a
state
dilemma
because
it
is
up
to
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
the
confession
was
the
prime
motivating
factor
and
not
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
the
only
answer
i
can
give
your
honor
is
that
the
federal
courts
throughout
the
country
have
lived
with
this
problem
for
long
lengths
of
time
that
there
have
been
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
like
to
think
that
whenever
a
claimant
comes
in
to
court
with
a
constitutional
claim
that
it
is
not
suffering
for
a
district
judge
to
hear
that.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
pennsylvania
against
or
pennsylvania
ex
rel
herman
against
claudy
was
eight
years
later.
i
think
in
the
machibroda
case,
it
was
four
or
five
years
later.
we're
dealing
with
indigent
defendants
who
are
not
trained
lawyers,
who
don't
wake
up
right
away
to
violations
of
their
rights
because
they
don't
realize
that
their
rights
have
been
violated.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
two
of
the
defendants
alleged
that
that
court-assigned
counsel
was
incompetent,
that
court-assigned
counsel
didn't
protect
their
best
interests,
and
those
of
the
hearing
goes
forward
on
the
allegations
or
it
doesn't.
now,
i
would
like
just
very
briefly
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
first
of
all
the
second
circuit
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
motivation.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
motivation
is
only
one
of
the
two
aspects
that
have
to
or
one
of
the
two
factors
that
have
to
be
proved.
the
defendant
must
prove
a
real
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
because
the
reason
that
he's
given
relief
is
not
his
subjective
state
of
mind,
it's
because
the
state
coerced
a
confession
from
him.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
but
the
motivation
is
not
the
be-all
and
end-all.
he
can't
say
until
the
cows
come
home
that
the
reason
i
confessed
or
the
reason
i
pleaded
was
because
of
this
confession.
if
the
confession
was
not
extracted
by
physical
brutality
or
psychological
torture,
he
has
no
standing
to
complain.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
in
the
least
you
--
this
hearing
is
proceeding
before
a
district
court
judge.
the
district
court
judge
could
believe
the
defendant
or
the
district
court
judge
could
disbelieve
the
defendant
and
it's
been
my
experience
as
a
defense
lawyer
that
the
defendant
has
to
come
in
with
the
little
bit
more
than
you've
said
in
order
to
convince
the
district
court
judge.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
this
may
seem
like
a
problem
in
the
abstract,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
problem
in
the
concrete
situation
because
as
i
have
said
before
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
would
rather
--
i
would
like
to
answer
that
by
saying
that
there
have
been
hearings
of
this
sort
and
perhaps
the
latest
case
is
french
against
united
states
which
is
ninth
circuit
case
were
after
a
full
hearing
the
district
court
judge
found
that
the
confessions
were
taken
in
violation
of
both
miranda
and
escobedo
that
they
were
illegal
confessions,
but
also
found
that
the
illegal
confessions
did
not
induce
the
plea
because
there
were
a
number
of
other
facts
in
the
case.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
how
it
has
been
done.
i
think
that's
the
only
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
precisely
because
i
think
the
theory
of
every
other
case
that
we
cite
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
also
of
substantial
motivation
theory,
but
for
substantial
motivation
prime
inducing
factor
and
you
don't
have
to
psychoanalyze
the
defendant
at
the
hearing
to
come
to
the
result.
it
just
--
it
hasn't
proved
that
much
of
a
problem
in
practice.
i
think
that
that's
my
only
--
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give.
courts
have
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time
and
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
standard
announced
in
every
other
circuit.
substantial
motivation,
but
for
prime
factor,
language
is
imprecise
and
people
struggle
with
a
word
that
shows
cause
an
effect,
prime
cause
an
effect.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
the
test
has
been
yes
whether
or
not
the
plea
was
voluntary
but
what
is
voluntary.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
with
the
all
due
difference
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
decision
that
all.
the
genesis
of
this
whole
case
came
from
glenn
against
mcmann.
glenn
against
mcmann
was
a
decision
which
says
--
which
said
that
a
guilty
plea
was
a
waiver
of
all
prior
non-jurisdictional
defects
and
refused
to
recognize
the
other
side
of
the
coin
which
was
that
an
involuntary
guilty
plea
is
a
nullity
and
i
think
that
since
chambers
against
florida
and
herman
against
claudy,
walker
and
johnson,
waley
and
johnson,
this
court
has
taken
into
account
the
pressures
brought
to
bear
upon
the
defendant
to
get
him
to
plead
and
specifically
that
one
of
those
pressures
could
be
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
voluntary
is
the
conclusion
that
we're
all
after
and
when
you
say
voluntary
plea,
i
must
take
exception
with
you
because
i
think
all
you
have
in
these
cases
are
pleas
of
guilty
and
whether
they're
voluntary
or
they're
presumptively
voluntary,
let's
say
because
you
have
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
the
earmarks
of
voluntariness
were
there.
now,
even
in
your
two
confession
cases,
the
second
confession
can
have
all
the
earmarks
of
respectability,
but
something
might
have
happened
to
that
defendant
before
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
except
to
utter
the
second
confession
of
guilt
and
that's
our
understanding
of
the
rationale
behind
the
circuit
decision.
pleas
don't
come
out
of
thin
air.
pleas
our
caused
--
just
as
jury
verdicts
don't
come
out
of
thin
air.
jury
verdicts
are
predicated
upon
what
goes
before
the
jury,
pleas
are
predicated
upon
what
happens
to
a
defendant
between
the
times
he's
arrested
and
between
the
time
he
comes
to
court.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
taking
--
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
he
has
a
perfectly
free
choice
at
that
point.
he
can
go
to
trial
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
can't
see
a
free
choice
when
you
have
an
attorney,
say
in
richardson,
the
allegations
were
this.
i
was
picked
up.
i
was
subject
to
physical
and
verbal
abuse.
i
confessed
my
guilt
to
a
crime
i
didn't
commit
just
to
stop
the
beating.
i
wanted
to
call
a
lawyer
because
i
knew
a
lawyer.
they
wouldn't
let
me
call
a
lawyer.
i
was
assigned
a
counsel,
a
court-assigned
counsel
to
represent
me
in
a
capital
case.
he
came
in
to
see
me
for
a
ten-minute
conference
and
he
said
to
me,
âi'll
get
the
same
amount
of
money
no
matter
what
happens
to
you,â
talked
to
him
for
ten
minutes.
when
richardson
and
came
to
court
told
the
attorney
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
trial,
he
didn't
want
the
plea
that
was
offered
because
he
only
confessed
since
the
confession
had
been
beaten
out
of
him.
the
attorney
said,
âthis
isn't
the
proper
time
to
raise
the
confession.
you
go
ahead
and
take
the
plea
and
save
your
life
and
bring
it
up
later
by
habeas
corpus.â
well,
that
was
completely
wrong
advice.
if
this
is
a
voluntary
plea
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
fortuitously
only,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
a
very
bad
advice.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
it
was
--
you
can't
escape
the
fact
that
it
was
wrong
advice
at
the
time.
the
nicholson
case
in
new
york
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief
was
decided
a
year
before
and
nicholson
set
a
guilty
plea
as
a
waiver.
you
can't
plead
and
raise
a
coerced
confession
claim.
this
man
says,
i
wanted
to
tell
a
court
what
those
police
did
to
me
and
my
attorney
said
to
me
don't
do
it
now.
let's
go
ahead,
let's
get
it
over.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
offer
of
a
plea
to
lesser
degree
is
not
an
uncommon
offer
in
new
york.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
secondly,
it
could
very
well
be
that
everything
that
richardson
says
can
--
just
won't
wash
at
a
hearing.
perhaps
the
reason
that
he
pleaded
was
because
of
the
offer
of
a
lesser
plea
but
the
circuit
recognized
this,
the
circuit
said
this
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
resolved
after
a
hearing.
we
can't
decide
this
on
the
pleadings.
but
my
point
is
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor
and
there's
nothing
in
new
york
state's
answers
that
say
that
they
weren't.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
these
cases
are
little
bit
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
--
well,
at
that
stage
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
will.
i
would
--
what
comes
into
the
mind
is
first
amendment,
fourteenth
amendment,
we
just
can't
permit
this
kind
of
thing.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
the
point
here
is
that
if
it
was
a
motivating
factor
to
induce
a
plea,
the
state
had
the
benefit
of
that
wrong
its
police
officers
committed
in
that
back
room
of
the
station
house.
pleas
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
make
the
presumption
one
way
or
another.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
don't
agree.
the
state
made
this
argument
in
their
brief
and
our
counterargument
to
that
was
there
has
been
case
after
case
in
which
they
did
introduce
it
and
i
think
in
this
respect
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
right
and
this
is
something
that's
pointed
out
that
i
think
very
cogently
by
professor
oshiler
(ph)
in
his
university
of
chicago
law
review
article
where
he
says
that
sometimes,
compromised
police
are
offered
by
the
prosecution
to
cover
up
constitutional
weaknesses
in
their
case
and
i
would
think
that
the
extent
to
which
it
could
be
shown
by
a
petitioner
that
he
was
offered
a
plea
to
a
lesser
degree
in
his
case
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
worried
about
the
legality
of
his
confession
to
that
extent
bad
faith
is
present.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
these
cases,
i
think
the
petitions
themselves
cry
out
as
to
why
the
choice
is
not
final.
each
man
said,
i
was
coerced
into
confessing
to
a
crime
i
did
not
commit
and
i
pleaded
because
i
had
no
other
alternative
and
if
the
law's
ears
are
closed
to
this
kind
of
plea,
just
for
the
name
of
finality,
i
think
that
we
haven't
gained
anything.
the
other
way,
okay
we
have
to
work
a
little
bit
harder
but
it's
worth
it
in
order
to
uncover
the
one
instance
of
injustice
that
may
exist
or
the
five
or
the
ten
to
the
20
and
there
are
--
the
plea
is
the
least
circumscribed
of
all
procedures
upon
which
a
conviction
is
predicated
and
what
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
may
not
be
that
severed.
i
would
just
like
to
turn
to
the
williams
petition
for
a
moment
because
i
think
that
mr.
juviler
misstated
williams'
claims
to
a
certain
extent.
williams
alleged
that
he
was
20
years
old
when
he
was
arrested
that
he
was
held
without
booking,
he
wasn't
informed
of
his
rights,
he
was
handcuffed
to
a
chair,
he
was
beaten,
he
had
no
food
or
sleep
because
of
this
he
confessed
and
alleged
that
to
confession
was
false.
he
said
that
he
was
initially
offered
a
plea
but
he
refused
to
plead
and
refused
to
plead
guilty
but
his
attorney
told
him
that
the
plea
was
merely
to
a
misdemeanor
and
williams
alleged
that
the
judge
at
pleading
never
told
him
that
the
crime
he
was
pleading
to
was
a
felony.
well,
the
state
never
produced
the
williams
hearing
minutes,
so
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
informed
him.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
robbery.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
robbery.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
now,
williams
also
alleged
that
he
told
his
attorney
that
he
had
an
alibi
defense
and
the
attorney
refused
to
raise
at
a
trial
were
also
as
mr.
juviler
before
pulled
out
of
the
thin
air.
the
only
fact,
one
significant
fact
that
i
think
that
we
can
come
forward
with
was
a
fact
that
appears
on
those
so-called
dci
sheet
which
the
attorney
general
annexed
to
their
answer
in
district
court
which
shows
that
mr.
williams
in
fact
on
a
prior
date
had
been
identified
as
being
in
dayton,
ohio
in
court
on
a
day
when
he
was
in
jail
or
in
new
york
city
in
court
on
the
day
when
he
was
in
jail
in
dayton,
ohio
and
that
factor
in
itself
gives
one
a
little
bit
of
disquiet.
so
that
again
what
the
circuit
did
in
this
williams
case
was
to
look
at
the
allegations
to
say,
do
these
allegations,
state
of
claim
which
have
proved
at
a
hearing
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
relief
and
i
think
that
the
answer
is
if
these
allegations
were
proved
at
a
hearing,
there
is
not
one
court
in
the
country
that
could
say
that
this
was
a
voluntary
plea.
this
was
a
plea
that
was
produced
not
because
the
defendant
freely
and
voluntarily
acknowledged
his
guilt
but
because
of
factors
outside
of
his
control
which
were
brought
to
bear
on
him
and
he
was
left
with
no
alternative.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
now,
this
was
richardson,
your
honor.
and
in
there
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
and
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
if
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
if
the
confession
was
the
reason
that
he
made
this
in-court
admission
then
that
in-court
admission
is
tainted
and
i
think
that
here
i
must
cite
harrison
against
united
states
where
a
similar
kind
of
situation
was
considered
because
in
that
case,
the
defendant
had
made
a
confession
which
was
introduced
into
two
evidence
at
the
first
trial
and
the
defendant
took
the
stand
in
order
to
counter
certain
statements
that
were
contained
in
the
confession.
when
the
confession
was
ruled
involuntary,
the
state
sought
to
introduce
the
in-court
admission
at
the
second
trial.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
no
after
there
is
a
confession
and
when
you
have
an
attorney
who
is
not
willing
to
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
he
could
have
said
no
and
the
house
could
have
fallen
on
his
head
even
harder
than
it
did
fall.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
new
york,
that's
really
not
so
clear
because
new
york
has
a
couple
of
cases
which
hold
that
if
inconsistent
material
comes
out
at
the
pleading
then
the
judge
does
have
a
duty
to
make
further
inquiry.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
afraid
that
i
can't
make
two
compartments
and
say
what
happened
in
court
was
respectable
even
though
what
happened
out
of
court
immediately
before
it
was
not.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
if
the
in-court
admission
is
going
to
be
isolated
from
everything
that
happened
before
the
statements
in
court
were
made,
then
no
collateral
attack
upon
the
plea
of
guilty
is
possible.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
because
it's
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
guilt
or
innocence
is
relevant
to
a
certain
extent,
but
i
don't
think
it's
dispositive
because
in
all
cases
where
the
voluntariness
or
the
intelligent
nature
of
a
plea
is
considered,
the
allegation
that
a
man
is
innocent
to
is
not
critical
because
we
are
arguing
due
process.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor
because
a
plea
can
be
coerced
even
from
a
man
who
is
guilty
and
in
that
--
in
a
such
a
case
the
due
process
clause
does
not
permit
that
plea
to
stand.
if
a
plea
is
coerced
because
let's
say
a
judge
tells
a
defendant
i
know
that
you're
the
man
that
did
it
and
you
got
a
trial
and
waste
my
time
and
you're
going
to
get
60
years
whereas
if
you
plead
i'll
give
you
consideration
and
then
man
pleads,
that's
not
a
voluntary
plea
even
though
the
man
might
be
guilty
and
that
plea
is
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law
because
we
have
two
values
that
we're
concerned
with.
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process,
the
pleading
process
and
also
the
value
of
making
this
process
one
that
comports
with
due
process
of
law.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
if
his
freedom
of
choice
has
been
removed,
if
he
can
make
no
other
statement
because
of
what
happened
to
him
before
the
plea
was
entered,
then
the
in-court
admission
is
as
tainted
as
the
out
of
court
admission
and
i
think
that
this
i
can
only
again
cite
to
harrison
because
i
think
this
was
the
consideration
which
underlie
the
harrison
case.
there
was
no
question
about
the
truthfulness
or
untruthfulness
of
the
admissions
made
on
trial
in
that
case.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
those
admissions
were
the
fruit
of
a
poison
tree,
and
this
is
precisely
the
way
i
see.
the
plea
situation
itself
was
the
in-court
admission
at
the
time
the
plea
was
taken
a
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
and
the
poison
tree
being
a
coerced
confession
in
all
of
these
cases.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
a
coerced
plea?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
each
of
the
three
cases
there
were
independent
or
separate
allegations.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
know,
your
honor
because
there
has
never
been
the
hearing.
we
have
only
that
the
petitioners
allegations
and
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
allegation
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
--
the
allegations
vary
from
case
to
case
because
each
case
was
brought
separately.
these
were
not
three
cases
that
were
brought
together.
they
just
came
sort
of
went
their
way
up
together.
so
that
in
richardson,
the
first
case
you
have
a
man
who's
on
trial
for
a
capital
case.
he
alleged
that
he
was
questioned,
beaten
and
that
the
reason
that
he
confessed
to
the
police
was
to
get
them
to
stop
beating
him
even
though
he
hadn't
committed
the
crime.
he
alleged
that
he
was
given
court-assigned
counsel
who
refused
to
do
anything
to
prepare
for
trial
and
who
also
affirmatively
mislead
him
about
the
time
for
raising
the
issue
of
coerced
confession
and
richardson
said
in
effect
because
of
the
coerced
confession,
because
my
counsel
didn't
do
anything
for
me,
i
had
no
choice
other
than
to
plead
guilty.
therefore,
i
pleaded
and
i
made
the
admissions
that
i
made
in
court.
in
dash,
you
have
a
defendant
who
was
arrested
after
he
was
indicted.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
that
his
--
that
his
lawyer
refused
to
do
anything
to
prepare
the
case
to
take
to
the
case
to.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
there
was
no
allegation
about
the
complaint
but
the
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
--
the
complaints
to
court
are
really
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
with
the
kind
of
client
that
we
have
legal
aid
society
in
new
york
city
represent,
people
don't
know
enough
to
complain
about
their
rights.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
oh,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
haven't
seen
at
that
often
and
i've
been
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
not
a
charge.
you
can't
make
a
conclusory
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
that
there
was
--
here
you
have
a
ten-minute
conference
taking
the
allegations
on
their
face
un-controverted
an
allegation
of
a
ten-minute
conference
between
an
attorney
and
a
client
in
a
capital
case
and
there
are
at
least
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
yet
you
have
a
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
same
thing
happened.
the
defendant
didn't
complain
and
he
only
got
his
relief
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
years
after
the
fact.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
and
no
complaint
was
made
and
possibly
at
a
hearing
the
fact
that
no
complaint
was
made
might
be
considered
dispositive
either
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
defendant's
allegations
afterwards
or
may
not
but
that's
something
to
be
considered
at
a
hearing.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
was
never
a
hearing
in
anyone
of
these
three
cases
in
the
new
york
courts?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
it
was,
i
believe
all
of
these
allega
--
all
of
these
claims
were
alleged
and
mr.
juviler's
bringing
in
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
on
oral
argument.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that
there
were
post-conviction
--
that
there
were
post-conviction
remedies
sought
probably
coram
nobis
in
all
cases.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
the
state
never
made
the
papers
a
part
of
the
record
below.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
we
were
assigned
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
which
point
the
record
was
fixed.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
papers
were
not
before
the
district
court
and
that's
the
way
the
cases
came
up.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
separate
crime,
richardson
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
the
allegations
are
different
in
each
case.
the
allegations
that
i
gave
you
before
were
the
allegations
in
the
richardson
case.
the
allegations
on
the
dash
case
are
completely
different
because
it
wasn't
--
dash
never
challenged
the
competence
of
his
attorney.
dash
said
that
the
reason
he
didn't
go
to
trial
and
raised
the
coerced
confession
claim
was
because
he
had
an
--
the
only
trial
procedure
given
to
him
by
new
york
was
an
unconstitutional
one
and
that
the
failure
to
invoke
an
unconstitutional
procedure
is
not
a
waiver.
williams
alleged
that
his
attorney
didn't
investigate
the
alibi
defense.
i
see
that
my
time
is
over.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
primary
things
that
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
because
i
feel
that
there
has
been
either
misstatement
or
confusion
about
first
of
all,
the
facts
in
the
case
and
secondly,
just
precisely
what
the
court
below
did
do
in
each
of
these
cases
and
what
it
did
not
do.
first
and
foremost,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
second
circuit
did
not
announce
a
new
rule
of
law
in
any
of
these
cases.
it
merely
reinterpreted
and
severely
limited
one
of
its
own
cases,
united
states
against
ex
rel.
glenn
against
mcmann.
now,
this
was
a
very
long
overdue
step
because
the
glenn
decision
was
at
odds
with
decisions
in
this
court
as
well
as
with
the
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeal
of
at
least
five
other
circuits.
secondly,
the
court
below
in
limiting
this
glenn
decision
acknowledged
that
under
certain
circumstances,
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession
could
coerce
a
guilty
plea.
the
surprising
thing
about
this
recognition
is
that
it
came
so
late.
but
it
cannot
be
stressed
enough
that
the
second
circuit
did
not
hold
that
the
bare
allegation
that
a
confession
was
coerced
entitles
a
habeas
petitioner
either
to
a
hearing
or
to
relief.
a
certain
specified
cause
an
effect
relationship
has
to
be
alleged
and
has
to
be
proved
and
the
cause
an
effect
relationship
varies
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
in
the
richardson
case
and
to
an
extent
in
the
williams
case,
the
reason
that
the
defendant
was
prevented
from
raising
his
confession
claim
at
trial
was
because
he
was
represented
by
counsel
who
was
incompetent
or
negligent
and
refused
to
lift
a
finger
to
help
him.
according
to
the
allegations,
now
we're
on
the
pleadings
here,
and
this
is
not
a
question
of
what
has
been
proved,
these
are
un-controverted
allegations.
in
the
dash
case,
the
cause
an
effect
relationship
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
guilty
plea
was
that
counsel
was
unable
to
do
anything
meaningful
to
prevent
the
coerced
confession
from
being
used
to
convict
the
defendant
at
trial
and
the
reason
for
this
was
jackson
against
denno
or
stein
against
new
york,
i
should
say.
the
third
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
decisions
below
do
not
automatically
call
into
question
the
validity
of
all
guilty
pleas
no
matter
how
painstaking
and
how
complete
the
colloquy
at
pleading
has
been
or
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
been
represented
by
counsel.
the
second
circuit
merely
held
i
think
virtually
every
other
court
in
the
country
that
in
certain
instances
where
you
have
off
the
record
or
allegations
of
off
the
record
facts
in
a
petition
even
a
full
colloquy
at
pleading
and
even
representation
by
counsel
do
not
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
moreover,
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
both
these
factors,
the
completeness
of
the
colloquy
and
representation
by
counsel
are
entitled
to
great
weight
in
the
ultimate
assessment
of
the
voluntaries
of
the
plea.
and
in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
circuit
held
that
both
the
belief
--
the
burden
of
pleading
that
is
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
make
a
showing
to
get
a
hearing
and
the
burden
of
proof
at
the
hearing
of
each
and
every
allegation
in
the
petition
was
upon
the
habeas
petitioner.
now,
it
must
be
also
stressed
that
each
of
these
cases
came
up
for
review
on
the
pleading
and
the
issue
for
decision
in
each
case
was
whether
the
facts
alleged
to
the
each
petition's
stated
claims
which
have
prove
at
a
hearing
either
in
state
or
federal
court
would
entitle
the
petitioners
to
relief
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
second
circuit
gave
new
york
the
option
of
holding
the
hearing
that
it
envisioned
because
the
matter
was
remitted
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
was
to
hold
the
hearing
only
if
new
york
did
not
hold
the
hearing.
in
each
case,
the
circuit
held
that
if
the
allegation
were
proved
at
a
hearing
then
pleas
in
each
case
were
involuntary
and
for
this
reason,
a
hearing
had
to
be
held.
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
state's
position
and
in
all
of
these
cases
where
they
took
the
position
because
at
least
in
one
case
no
response
was
filed
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
allegations
even
if
proved
at
a
hearing
would
not
entitle
the
respondents
to
relief.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
i
would
have
to
amplify
that
just
to
a
certain
extent.
the
circuit
in
its
burden
of
pleading
put
upon
the
petitioner
the
obligation
to
come
forward
with
whatever
affidavits
record
proof
to
so
much.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
no,
in
order
to
get
the
hearing
so
that
the
bare
allegations
as
you
have
outlined.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
if
he
made
a
colorable
showing
and
if
i
think
of
that's
the
only
way
i
can
express
it,
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that
the
confession
for
reasons
specified
was
the
factor
which
induced
his
plea
of
guilty.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
richardson,
you
have
the
factor
of
incompetency
of
counsel
which
i
think
comes
to
bear
in
two
places,
that
it
is
an
independent
ground
or
claim
for
relief
beyond
the
coerced
confession
claim
and
vis-Ã -vis
the
coerced
confession
claim,
counsel's
failure
to
investigate
and
counsel's
wrong
advice
and
it
was
clearly
wrong
under
new
york
law
and
under
federal
law
at
that
time
about
the
time
for
raising
the
confession
was
the
reason
the
nexus,
the
causal
connection.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
that's
fortuitous
circumstance
that
i
don't
think
should
have
anything
to
do
with
decision
here.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
divide
that
question
into
two
parts
and
then
answer
each
one.
i
think
that
before
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno,
if
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
competence
of
counsel,
but
there
is
the
allegation
that
the
reason
that
the
confession
issue
was
not
raised
at
trial
was
because
of
the
stein
procedure
and
all
of
the
chilling
effects
that
that
procedure
had
upon
or
the
distorting
effects
that
that
procedure
had
upon
the
fact
finding
process
and
the
guilt
determination.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
represented
by
competent
counsel
under
the
point
of
view
that
circuit
took
doesn't
preclude
him
from
a
hearing.
now,
after
jackson
against
denno,
you
have
a
different
kind
of
problem
because
as
mr.
juviler
has
pointed
out,
in
new
york
at
any
rate,
you
have
the
full
hearing
on
voluntariness
of
the
confession
that's
held
prior
to
trial,
at
that
point
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
the
other.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
and
after
jackson
against
denno
the
deterrent
effect
or
there
is
no
unconstitutional
procedure
which
could
deter
a
defendant
from
going
to
trial
on
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
but
i
believed
in
the
richardson
decision
which
was
not
an
en
banc
decision
and
a
separate
decision
in
which
one
of
the
dissenters
in
the
en
banc
wrote
the
majority.
the
connecting
factor
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
inability
to
raise
the
confession
issue
at
trial
was
--
the
allegation
of
incompetency
of
counsel
and
counsel's
mis-advise.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
but
in
dash,
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
second
circuit
that
there
was
no
allegation
of
incompetent
representation
by
counsel.
so
then
the
next
question
was,
well
if
you
have
a
claim
that
you
consider
a
valid
claim,
if
you
feel
that
your
confession
was
coerced,
you
have
competent
counsel
to
represent
you
at
trial,
you
had
your
chance
in
it,
why
didn't
you
present
that
claim
at
trial.
and
if
you
didn't
present
it
at
trial
can
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances
there
has
been
a
waiver
because
you
have
failed
to
present
the
claim
in
an
acceptable
state
procedure.
the
answer
to
that
was
stein
against
new
york
that
even
competent
counsel
before
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno
would
think
long
and
think
hard
about
taking
his
defendant
to
trial
with
a
coerced
confession
claim
under
that
procedure
and
i
cannot
stress
enough
the
detrimental
effect,
the
coercive
effect
that
that
procedure
had
both
to
counsel
and
to
a
defendant
confronted
with
a
coerced
confession
claim
and
the
possibility
of
trial
or
plea.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
the
circuit
viewed
it
in
terms
of
the
prime
motivating
factor
that
other
circuits
have
talked
about
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
taking
your
hypothetical
strictly
on
its
facts,
i
think
the
circuit
has
answered
the
question
in
its
opinion
by
saying
even
where
of
confession
is
coerced,
a
defense
counsel
may
have
--
may
properly
advise
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty,
say
if
there's
a
substantial
or
the
evidence
or
if
the
possibility
of
proving
the
claim
is
minimal
because
of
the
caliber
of
witnesses
is
in
so--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
perhaps
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
no
in
a
very
recent
case.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
and
i
would
say
no
also
under
the
decision
of
the
circuit
because
there
are
two
elements.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
there
are
two
elements
that
have
to
be
proved
not
only
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
coerced,
but
the
fact
that
the
confession
was
the
substantial,
the
prime,
the
main
motivating
force
behind
entry
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
now,
there
are
of
force
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
thought
that
your
hypothetical
was
that
he
was
not
--
well,
perhaps
i
divided
my
own
mind
a
little
bit
to
finely
not
that
he
was
a
afraid
of
the
coerced
confession
but
he
was
afraid
that
his
proof
would
not
be
accepted,
his
proof
of
coercion
would
not
be
accepted
voluntary.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
that
only
what
i
could
answer
that
question
your
honor
is
the
following.
i
believe
as
i
read
the
second
circuit
decisions
that
the
defendant
would
lose,
given
your
hypothetical
because
then
this
could
be
a
situation
possibly
were
a
lawyer
could
properly
advice
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
despite
the
confession.
i
think
that
there
are
other
courts
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
do
not
take
this
hard
and
fast
line
and
feel
that
or
have
granted
relief
in
cases
where
the
attorney
or
the
defendant
or
both
have
to
take
the
confession
into
account
as
one
factor
in
determining
the
strategy
of
whether
to
plead
or
go
to
trial
and
to
this
extent
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
guess
that
is
not
my
position
and
yes
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
if
it
--
if
it
were
a
major
factor
in
the
terms
that
the
second
circuit
has
spoken
out,
if
the
coerced
confession
were
the
prime
motivating
factor
and
not
other
kinds
of
considerations,
then
there
would
be
relief
but
i
say
that
the
second
circuit
has
taken
rather
a
hard
line
with
this
because
there
are
other
courts
which
have
granted
relief
upon
a
showing
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that
the
confession
was
the
factor
to
be
reckoned
with.
in
the
pleading
decision
i
think
that
that
i
believe

possibly.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
point,
i
think
that
the
dilemma
that
you
pose
is
really
not
a
prosecution
or
a
state
dilemma
because
it
is
up
to
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
the
confession
was
the
prime
motivating
factor
and
not
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
the
only
answer
i
can
give
your
honor
is
that
the
federal
courts
throughout
the
country
have
lived
with
this
problem
for
long
lengths
of
time
that
there
have
been
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
like
to
think
that
whenever
a
claimant
comes
in
to
court
with
a
constitutional
claim
that
it
is
not
suffering
for
a
district
judge
to
hear
that.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
pennsylvania
against
or
pennsylvania
ex
rel
herman
against
claudy
was
eight
years
later.
i
think
in
the
machibroda
case,
it
was
four
or
five
years
later.
we're
dealing
with
indigent
defendants
who
are
not
trained
lawyers,
who
don't
wake
up
right
away
to
violations
of
their
rights
because
they
don't
realize
that
their
rights
have
been
violated.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
two
of
the
defendants
alleged
that
that
court-assigned
counsel
was
incompetent,
that
court-assigned
counsel
didn't
protect
their
best
interests,
and
those
of
the
hearing
goes
forward
on
the
allegations
or
it
doesn't.
now,
i
would
like
just
very
briefly
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
first
of
all
the
second
circuit
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
motivation.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
motivation
is
only
one
of
the
two
aspects
that
have
to
or
one
of
the
two
factors
that
have
to
be
proved.
the
defendant
must
prove
a
real
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
because
the
reason
that
he's
given
relief
is
not
his
subjective
state
of
mind,
it's
because
the
state
coerced
a
confession
from
him.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
but
the
motivation
is
not
the
be-all
and
end-all.
he
can't
say
until
the
cows
come
home
that
the
reason
i
confessed
or
the
reason
i
pleaded
was
because
of
this
confession.
if
the
confession
was
not
extracted
by
physical
brutality
or
psychological
torture,
he
has
no
standing
to
complain.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
in
the
least
you
--
this
hearing
is
proceeding
before
a
district
court
judge.
the
district
court
judge
could
believe
the
defendant
or
the
district
court
judge
could
disbelieve
the
defendant
and
it's
been
my
experience
as
a
defense
lawyer
that
the
defendant
has
to
come
in
with
the
little
bit
more
than
you've
said
in
order
to
convince
the
district
court
judge.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
this
may
seem
like
a
problem
in
the
abstract,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
problem
in
the
concrete
situation
because
as
i
have
said
before
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
would
rather
--
i
would
like
to
answer
that
by
saying
that
there
have
been
hearings
of
this
sort
and
perhaps
the
latest
case
is
french
against
united
states
which
is
ninth
circuit
case
were
after
a
full
hearing
the
district
court
judge
found
that
the
confessions
were
taken
in
violation
of
both
miranda
and
escobedo
that
they
were
illegal
confessions,
but
also
found
that
the
illegal
confessions
did
not
induce
the
plea
because
there
were
a
number
of
other
facts
in
the
case.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
how
it
has
been
done.
i
think
that's
the
only
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
not
precisely
because
i
think
the
theory
of
every
other
case
that
we
cite
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
also
of
substantial
motivation
theory,
but
for
substantial
motivation
prime
inducing
factor
and
you
don't
have
to
psychoanalyze
the
defendant
at
the
hearing
to
come
to
the
result.
it
just
--
it
hasn't
proved
that
much
of
a
problem
in
practice.
i
think
that
that's
my
only
--
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give.
courts
have
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time
and
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
standard
announced
in
every
other
circuit.
substantial
motivation,
but
for
prime
factor,
language
is
imprecise
and
people
struggle
with
a
word
that
shows
cause
an
effect,
prime
cause
an
effect.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
think
the
test
has
been
yes
whether
or
not
the
plea
was
voluntary
but
what
is
voluntary.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
with
the
all
due
difference
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
decision
that
all.
the
genesis
of
this
whole
case
came
from
glenn
against
mcmann.
glenn
against
mcmann
was
a
decision
which
says
--
which
said
that
a
guilty
plea
was
a
waiver
of
all
prior
non-jurisdictional
defects
and
refused
to
recognize
the
other
side
of
the
coin
which
was
that
an
involuntary
guilty
plea
is
a
nullity
and
i
think
that
since
chambers
against
florida
and
herman
against
claudy,
walker
and
johnson,
waley
and
johnson,
this
court
has
taken
into
account
the
pressures
brought
to
bear
upon
the
defendant
to
get
him
to
plead
and
specifically
that
one
of
those
pressures
could
be
the
existence
of
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
voluntary
is
the
conclusion
that
we're
all
after
and
when
you
say
voluntary
plea,
i
must
take
exception
with
you
because
i
think
all
you
have
in
these
cases
are
pleas
of
guilty
and
whether
they're
voluntary
or
they're
presumptively
voluntary,
let's
say
because
you
have
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
the
earmarks
of
voluntariness
were
there.
now,
even
in
your
two
confession
cases,
the
second
confession
can
have
all
the
earmarks
of
respectability,
but
something
might
have
happened
to
that
defendant
before
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
except
to
utter
the
second
confession
of
guilt
and
that's
our
understanding
of
the
rationale
behind
the
circuit
decision.
pleas
don't
come
out
of
thin
air.
pleas
our
caused
--
just
as
jury
verdicts
don't
come
out
of
thin
air.
jury
verdicts
are
predicated
upon
what
goes
before
the
jury,
pleas
are
predicated
upon
what
happens
to
a
defendant
between
the
times
he's
arrested
and
between
the
time
he
comes
to
court.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well
taking
--
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
he
has
a
perfectly
free
choice
at
that
point.
he
can
go
to
trial
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
can't
see
a
free
choice
when
you
have
an
attorney,
say
in
richardson,
the
allegations
were
this.
i
was
picked
up.
i
was
subject
to
physical
and
verbal
abuse.
i
confessed
my
guilt
to
a
crime
i
didn't
commit
just
to
stop
the
beating.
i
wanted
to
call
a
lawyer
because
i
knew
a
lawyer.
they
wouldn't
let
me
call
a
lawyer.
i
was
assigned
a
counsel,
a
court-assigned
counsel
to
represent
me
in
a
capital
case.
he
came
in
to
see
me
for
a
ten-minute
conference
and
he
said
to
me,
âi'll
get
the
same
amount
of
money
no
matter
what
happens
to
you,â
talked
to
him
for
ten
minutes.
when
richardson
and
came
to
court
told
the
attorney
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
trial,
he
didn't
want
the
plea
that
was
offered
because
he
only
confessed
since
the
confession
had
been
beaten
out
of
him.
the
attorney
said,
âthis
isn't
the
proper
time
to
raise
the
confession.
you
go
ahead
and
take
the
plea
and
save
your
life
and
bring
it
up
later
by
habeas
corpus.â
well,
that
was
completely
wrong
advice.
if
this
is
a
voluntary
plea
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
fortuitously
only,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
a
very
bad
advice.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
it
was
--
you
can't
escape
the
fact
that
it
was
wrong
advice
at
the
time.
the
nicholson
case
in
new
york
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief
was
decided
a
year
before
and
nicholson
set
a
guilty
plea
as
a
waiver.
you
can't
plead
and
raise
a
coerced
confession
claim.
this
man
says,
i
wanted
to
tell
a
court
what
those
police
did
to
me
and
my
attorney
said
to
me
don't
do
it
now.
let's
go
ahead,
let's
get
it
over.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
offer
of
a
plea
to
lesser
degree
is
not
an
uncommon
offer
in
new
york.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
secondly,
it
could
very
well
be
that
everything
that
richardson
says
can
--
just
won't
wash
at
a
hearing.
perhaps
the
reason
that
he
pleaded
was
because
of
the
offer
of
a
lesser
plea
but
the
circuit
recognized
this,
the
circuit
said
this
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
resolved
after
a
hearing.
we
can't
decide
this
on
the
pleadings.
but
my
point
is
that
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor
and
there's
nothing
in
new
york
state's
answers
that
say
that
they
weren't.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
these
cases
are
little
bit
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
--
well,
at
that
stage
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
will.
i
would
--
what
comes
into
the
mind
is
first
amendment,
fourteenth
amendment,
we
just
can't
permit
this
kind
of
thing.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
the
point
here
is
that
if
it
was
a
motivating
factor
to
induce
a
plea,
the
state
had
the
benefit
of
that
wrong
its
police
officers
committed
in
that
back
room
of
the
station
house.
pleas
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
make
the
presumption
one
way
or
another.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
don't
agree.
the
state
made
this
argument
in
their
brief
and
our
counterargument
to
that
was
there
has
been
case
after
case
in
which
they
did
introduce
it
and
i
think
in
this
respect
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that's
right
and
this
is
something
that's
pointed
out
that
i
think
very
cogently
by
professor
oshiler
(ph)
in
his
university
of
chicago
law
review
article
where
he
says
that
sometimes,
compromised
police
are
offered
by
the
prosecution
to
cover
up
constitutional
weaknesses
in
their
case
and
i
would
think
that
the
extent
to
which
it
could
be
shown
by
a
petitioner
that
he
was
offered
a
plea
to
a
lesser
degree
in
his
case
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
worried
about
the
legality
of
his
confession
to
that
extent
bad
faith
is
present.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
these
cases,
i
think
the
petitions
themselves
cry
out
as
to
why
the
choice
is
not
final.
each
man
said,
i
was
coerced
into
confessing
to
a
crime
i
did
not
commit
and
i
pleaded
because
i
had
no
other
alternative
and
if
the
law's
ears
are
closed
to
this
kind
of
plea,
just
for
the
name
of
finality,
i
think
that
we
haven't
gained
anything.
the
other
way,
okay
we
have
to
work
a
little
bit
harder
but
it's
worth
it
in
order
to
uncover
the
one
instance
of
injustice
that
may
exist
or
the
five
or
the
ten
to
the
20
and
there
are
--
the
plea
is
the
least
circumscribed
of
all
procedures
upon
which
a
conviction
is
predicated
and
what
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
may
not
be
that
severed.
i
would
just
like
to
turn
to
the
williams
petition
for
a
moment
because
i
think
that
mr.
juviler
misstated
williams'
claims
to
a
certain
extent.
williams
alleged
that
he
was
20
years
old
when
he
was
arrested
that
he
was
held
without
booking,
he
wasn't
informed
of
his
rights,
he
was
handcuffed
to
a
chair,
he
was
beaten,
he
had
no
food
or
sleep
because
of
this
he
confessed
and
alleged
that
to
confession
was
false.
he
said
that
he
was
initially
offered
a
plea
but
he
refused
to
plead
and
refused
to
plead
guilty
but
his
attorney
told
him
that
the
plea
was
merely
to
a
misdemeanor
and
williams
alleged
that
the
judge
at
pleading
never
told
him
that
the
crime
he
was
pleading
to
was
a
felony.
well,
the
state
never
produced
the
williams
hearing
minutes,
so
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
informed
him.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
robbery.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
robbery.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
now,
williams
also
alleged
that
he
told
his
attorney
that
he
had
an
alibi
defense
and
the
attorney
refused
to
raise
at
a
trial
were
also
as
mr.
juviler
before
pulled
out
of
the
thin
air.
the
only
fact,
one
significant
fact
that
i
think
that
we
can
come
forward
with
was
a
fact
that
appears
on
those
so-called
dci
sheet
which
the
attorney
general
annexed
to
their
answer
in
district
court
which
shows
that
mr.
williams
in
fact
on
a
prior
date
had
been
identified
as
being
in
dayton,
ohio
in
court
on
a
day
when
he
was
in
jail
or
in
new
york
city
in
court
on
the
day
when
he
was
in
jail
in
dayton,
ohio
and
that
factor
in
itself
gives
one
a
little
bit
of
disquiet.
so
that
again
what
the
circuit
did
in
this
williams
case
was
to
look
at
the
allegations
to
say,
do
these
allegations,
state
of
claim
which
have
proved
at
a
hearing
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
relief
and
i
think
that
the
answer
is
if
these
allegations
were
proved
at
a
hearing,
there
is
not
one
court
in
the
country
that
could
say
that
this
was
a
voluntary
plea.
this
was
a
plea
that
was
produced
not
because
the
defendant
freely
and
voluntarily
acknowledged
his
guilt
but
because
of
factors
outside
of
his
control
which
were
brought
to
bear
on
him
and
he
was
left
with
no
alternative.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
now,
this
was
richardson,
your
honor.
and
in
there
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
think
and
i
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
if
the
confession
was
involuntary
and
if
the
confession
was
the
reason
that
he
made
this
in-court
admission
then
that
in-court
admission
is
tainted
and
i
think
that
here
i
must
cite
harrison
against
united
states
where
a
similar
kind
of
situation
was
considered
because
in
that
case,
the
defendant
had
made
a
confession
which
was
introduced
into
two
evidence
at
the
first
trial
and
the
defendant
took
the
stand
in
order
to
counter
certain
statements
that
were
contained
in
the
confession.
when
the
confession
was
ruled
involuntary,
the
state
sought
to
introduce
the
in-court
admission
at
the
second
trial.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
no
after
there
is
a
confession
and
when
you
have
an
attorney
who
is
not
willing
to
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
he
could
have
said
no
and
the
house
could
have
fallen
on
his
head
even
harder
than
it
did
fall.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
in
new
york,
that's
really
not
so
clear
because
new
york
has
a
couple
of
cases
which
hold
that
if
inconsistent
material
comes
out
at
the
pleading
then
the
judge
does
have
a
duty
to
make
further
inquiry.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i'm
afraid
that
i
can't
make
two
compartments
and
say
what
happened
in
court
was
respectable
even
though
what
happened
out
of
court
immediately
before
it
was
not.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
if
the
in-court
admission
is
going
to
be
isolated
from
everything
that
happened
before
the
statements
in
court
were
made,
then
no
collateral
attack
upon
the
plea
of
guilty
is
possible.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor
because
it's
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
guilt
or
innocence
is
relevant
to
a
certain
extent,
but
i
don't
think
it's
dispositive
because
in
all
cases
where
the
voluntariness
or
the
intelligent
nature
of
a
plea
is
considered,
the
allegation
that
a
man
is
innocent
to
is
not
critical
because
we
are
arguing
due
process.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor
because
a
plea
can
be
coerced
even
from
a
man
who
is
guilty
and
in
that
--
in
a
such
a
case
the
due
process
clause
does
not
permit
that
plea
to
stand.
if
a
plea
is
coerced
because
let's
say
a
judge
tells
a
defendant
i
know
that
you're
the
man
that
did
it
and
you
got
a
trial
and
waste
my
time
and
you're
going
to
get
60
years
whereas
if
you
plead
i'll
give
you
consideration
and
then
man
pleads,
that's
not
a
voluntary
plea
even
though
the
man
might
be
guilty
and
that
plea
is
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law
because
we
have
two
values
that
we're
concerned
with.
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process,
the
pleading
process
and
also
the
value
of
making
this
process
one
that
comports
with
due
process
of
law.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
if
his
freedom
of
choice
has
been
removed,
if
he
can
make
no
other
statement
because
of
what
happened
to
him
before
the
plea
was
entered,
then
the
in-court
admission
is
as
tainted
as
the
out
of
court
admission
and
i
think
that
this
i
can
only
again
cite
to
harrison
because
i
think
this
was
the
consideration
which
underlie
the
harrison
case.
there
was
no
question
about
the
truthfulness
or
untruthfulness
of
the
admissions
made
on
trial
in
that
case.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
those
admissions
were
the
fruit
of
a
poison
tree,
and
this
is
precisely
the
way
i
see.
the
plea
situation
itself
was
the
in-court
admission
at
the
time
the
plea
was
taken
a
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
and
the
poison
tree
being
a
coerced
confession
in
all
of
these
cases.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
a
coerced
plea?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
each
of
the
three
cases
there
were
independent
or
separate
allegations.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
don't
know,
your
honor
because
there
has
never
been
the
hearing.
we
have
only
that
the
petitioners
allegations
and
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
allegation
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
in
--
the
allegations
vary
from
case
to
case
because
each
case
was
brought
separately.
these
were
not
three
cases
that
were
brought
together.
they
just
came
sort
of
went
their
way
up
together.
so
that
in
richardson,
the
first
case
you
have
a
man
who's
on
trial
for
a
capital
case.
he
alleged
that
he
was
questioned,
beaten
and
that
the
reason
that
he
confessed
to
the
police
was
to
get
them
to
stop
beating
him
even
though
he
hadn't
committed
the
crime.
he
alleged
that
he
was
given
court-assigned
counsel
who
refused
to
do
anything
to
prepare
for
trial
and
who
also
affirmatively
mislead
him
about
the
time
for
raising
the
issue
of
coerced
confession
and
richardson
said
in
effect
because
of
the
coerced
confession,
because
my
counsel
didn't
do
anything
for
me,
i
had
no
choice
other
than
to
plead
guilty.
therefore,
i
pleaded
and
i
made
the
admissions
that
i
made
in
court.
in
dash,
you
have
a
defendant
who
was
arrested
after
he
was
indicted.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no
that
his
--
that
his
lawyer
refused
to
do
anything
to
prepare
the
case
to
take
to
the
case
to.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
there
was
no
allegation
about
the
complaint
but
the
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
--
the
complaints
to
court
are
really
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
with
the
kind
of
client
that
we
have
legal
aid
society
in
new
york
city
represent,
people
don't
know
enough
to
complain
about
their
rights.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
oh,
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
haven't
seen
at
that
often
and
i've
been
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
not
a
charge.
you
can't
make
a
conclusory
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
well,
that
there
was
--
here
you
have
a
ten-minute
conference
taking
the
allegations
on
their
face
un-controverted
an
allegation
of
a
ten-minute
conference
between
an
attorney
and
a
client
in
a
capital
case
and
there
are
at
least
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
yet
you
have
a
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
same
thing
happened.
the
defendant
didn't
complain
and
he
only
got
his
relief
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
years
after
the
fact.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
but
still
and
no
complaint
was
made
and
possibly
at
a
hearing
the
fact
that
no
complaint
was
made
might
be
considered
dispositive
either
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
defendant's
allegations
afterwards
or
may
not
but
that's
something
to
be
considered
at
a
hearing.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
there
was
never
a
hearing
in
anyone
of
these
three
cases
in
the
new
york
courts?
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes
it
was,
i
believe
all
of
these
allega
--
all
of
these
claims
were
alleged
and
mr.
juviler's
bringing
in
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
on
oral
argument.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
that
there
were
post-conviction
--
that
there
were
post-conviction
remedies
sought
probably
coram
nobis
in
all
cases.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
the
state
never
made
the
papers
a
part
of
the
record
below.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
your
honor,
we
were
assigned
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
which
point
the
record
was
fixed.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
the
papers
were
not
before
the
district
court
and
that's
the
way
the
cases
came
up.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
separate
crime,
richardson
--
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
yes.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
no,
your
honor.
the
allegations
are
different
in
each
case.
the
allegations
that
i
gave
you
before
were
the
allegations
in
the
richardson
case.
the
allegations
on
the
dash
case
are
completely
different
because
it
wasn't
--
dash
never
challenged
the
competence
of
his
attorney.
dash
said
that
the
reason
he
didn't
go
to
trial
and
raised
the
coerced
confession
claim
was
because
he
had
an
--
the
only
trial
procedure
given
to
him
by
new
york
was
an
unconstitutional
one
and
that
the
failure
to
invoke
an
unconstitutional
procedure
is
not
a
waiver.
williams
alleged
that
his
attorney
didn't
investigate
the
alibi
defense.
i
see
that
my
time
is
over.
ms.
gretchen
white
oberman
thank
you.
