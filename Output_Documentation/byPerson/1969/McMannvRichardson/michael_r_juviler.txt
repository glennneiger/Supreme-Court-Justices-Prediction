mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
from
the
bench
if
a
defendant
plead
at
guilty
prior
to
the
bruton
decision,
he
may
not
now
come
forward
and
say
that
he
was
induced
to
plead
because
he
expected
that
his
co-defendants'
confession
would
be
introduced
and
the
jury
would
hear
it
and
that
would
prejudice
him.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it's
difficult
to
understand
precisely
how
far
the
second
circuit
would
go,
but
i
think
that
is
a
logical
outcome
of
much
of
the
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit
and
i
think
it's
intolerable
--
it
is
an
intolerable
outcome.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
new
york
state
appears
to
be
the
only
jurisdiction
in
america
in
which
there
can
be
a
pre-trial
hearing
as
to
admissibility
of
confessions
and
the
defendant
may
preserve
his
claim
of
coercion
on
appeal
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
has
the
option
of
withdrawing
his
plea
and
going
to
trial
or
negotiating
a
lesser
plea,
but
at
his
option,
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
vacated.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
time
limit
is
the
normal
appellate
process.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
this
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
in
1965,
about
six
months
after
the
jackson
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
hearings
include
the
issue
of
confession,
i
would
assume,
in
every
jurisdiction
but
only
in
new
york
is
that
issue
preserved
on
appeal
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
the
logical
outcome
perhaps
of
the
second
circuit
opinion
read
in
its
broadest
sense
is
to
require
the
new
york
procedure
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
be
enacted
in
every
jurisdiction
because
the
logical
outcome
indeed
of
the
second
circuit
position
and
apparently
of
the
relators'
arguments
is
that
if
evidence
is
obtained
by
police
in
an
illegal
manner,
there
really
is
no
way
that
a
contested
hearing
on
issues
of
fact
can
be
avoided
even
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
here,
we
have
merely
allegations
of
coercion
of
the
confessions
unsupported
by
anything
outside
of
the
petitioner's
own
motions,
but
even
assuming
the
truth
of
these
allegations,
there
is
no
connection,
there
is
no
nexus
in
a
constitutional
sense
between
this
alleged
coercion
and
the
plea
of
guilty.
so
long
as
the
defendant
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
to
raise
these
constitutional
claims
and
indeed
the
expansion
of
the
list
of
these
claims
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
requires
that
we
maintain
the
time
honored
orderly
procedures
for
presenting
these
claims
whether
they
involved
confessions
or
tangible
evidence
or
eyewitness
identification.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
nexus
in
the
allegation
that
a
plea
of
guilty
was
induced
by
the
threatened
use
of
a
coerced
confession.
that
is
merely
a
legal
fiction
which
states
the
conclusion
to
be
reached
but
that
is
not
a
step
in
the
reasoning.
there
is
no
claim
factually
in
these
cases
that
the
relators
were
told
by
any
public
official
that
these
confessions
known
to
be
coerced
by
the
state
were
going
to
be
use
against
them
and
for
that
reason
they
had
better
plead
guilty.
these
were
self-motivated
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
second
possible
nexus
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
plea
of
guilty
and
that
is
the
suggested
nexus
of
incompetency
of
counsel.
if
the
attorney
consulting
with
his
client
as
is
admitted
to
have
occurred
in
each
one
of
these
cases
consulting
with
his
client
as
to
the
prospects
for
suppressing
this
confession
knowing
as
is
admitted
in
each
one
of
these
cases
by
the
relators
that
they
had
a
opportunity
--
they
had
a
procedure
by
which
they
could
keep
this
confession
out
of
evidence
and
if
after
those
deliberations,
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
reach
the
considered
judgment
that
it
would
be
the
bet
to
the
best
interest
of
the
defendant
to
accept
an
offer
of
a
lesser
plea
and
to
forgo
the
trial
then
that
decisions
should
be
binding.
that
is
what
a
plea
of
guilty
is
all
about.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
the
relators
are
striving
to
find
some
kind
of
a
constitutionally
acceptable
theory
on
which
they
can
connect
this
confession.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
as
i
suggest
it
has
been
used
in
many
contexts
and
i'm
just
trying
to
pinpoint
that.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
to
me
i
would
say
that
a
nexus
is
some
constitutionally
acceptable
reason
why
the
plea
of
guilty
should
not
be
considered
binding.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
no,
and
i
think
that
in
such
a
nexus
would
include
the
following.
one
would
be
that
the
advice
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
a
chance.
it's
just
a
statement
of
the
conclusion.
nexus
means
under
what
circumstances
will
we
allow
a
defendant
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
some
relationship.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
could
mean
a
factual
connection.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
to
me,
it
means
a
factual
connection.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
means
a
continuation
of
the
coercion
that
was
addressed
in
the
station
house
to
the
defendant,
a
continuation
of
that
coercion
into
the
courtroom.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
that
is
not
alleged
in
these
cases.
that
is
not
alleged
in
these
cases
or
per
--
and
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
other
than
that
to
take
out
of
our
--
to
take
out
this
case
the
dispositive
fact
that
these
defendants
had
attorneys
who
with
the
relators
made
a
reasoned
choice
to
forgo
their
constitutional
challenges
as
long
as
there's
nothing
to
remove
that
then
the
plea
of
guilty
should
mean
what
it
says,
i
am
guilty,
though
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
now,
it
seems
apparent
from
the
decisions
in
the
states
and
in,
i
would
say,
all
of
the
circuits
that
this
is
assumed
to
be
the
case
with
the
search
and
seizure
claims
where
there
is
an
attack
in
post-conviction
proceedings
on
the
admissibility
of
tangible
evidence
after
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be
any
difference
when
we
come
to
the
confession
claim
other
than
the
perhaps
emotionally
significant
fact
that
both
the
plea
of
guilty
and
the
confession
are
oral,
but
if
there
is
a
break
in
the
chain
of
events
between
the
station
house
interrogation
and
the
plea
of
guilty
as
there
is
in
each
one
of
these
cases
then
that
fact
that
these
are
both
oral
is
completely
immaterial.
there
is
an
independent
act
of
free
will
exercised
by
these
defendants
when
they
decided
to
forgo
their
trial.
the
cat
was
not
out
of
the
bag
when
they
allegedly
confessed
in
the
station
house.
now,
if
a
defendant
is
coerced
into
confessing
by
the
police
and
subsequently
while
in
custody
he
makes
another
confession,
that
second
confession
maybe
admissible
at
a
trial
even
though
in
a
sense
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
if
the
facts
established
that
there
was
a
break
in
the
chain
of
events
and
that
the
second
confession
was
voluntary
and
came
after
the
defendant
was
aware
of
his
rights.
well,
in
our
case
the
confession,
the
cat
is
not
out
of
the
bag
at
all
because
that
the
defendant
aided
by
counsel
is
still
armed
with
the
power
to
try
to
keep
that
cat
in
the
bag.
he
just
says
that
it's
not
worth
my
trying
for
various
reasons
and
so
long
as
the
state
or
the
federal
government
does
not
unnecessarily
discourage
the
opportunity
of
the
defendant
to
challenge
these
pieces
of
evidence
then
his
decision
not
to
do
so
should
be
binding.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
could
enter
into
the
picture
if
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
are
actually,
factually
motivated
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
on
the
feeling
that
they
just
can't
get
a
fair
trial,
they
just
can't
get
a
fair
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
the
first
obligation
is
to
allege
it
before
such
a
hearing
should
be
ordered.
we
cannot
just
presume
it.
i
think
indeed
it
would
be
unreasonable
mr.
justice
marshall
to
presume
that
because
i
think
in
common
sense
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
there
is
no
reason
to
believe.
it's
purely
speculative
to
say
that
this
difference
between
the
stein
procedure,
the
pre-jackson
procedure
and
the
post-jackson
procedure
compelled
this
defendant
or
unnecessarily
encouraged
him
to
forgo
the
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
tried
and
he
prevailed
in
the
second
circuit,
but
i
think
that
with
all
respect
to
the
opinion
of
judge
kaufman,
it
is
not
persuasive
and
it
does
not
overcome
the
fact
that
there
was
no
factual
allegation.
it
just
doesn't
overcome
the
dissent
of
judge
friendly.
now,
that
the
relators
here
in
this
court,
the
way
their
brief
is
written
urge
on
the
court
this
factual
connection,
this
actual,
factual
motivation
entering
into
the
minds
of
counsel
that
they
sat
down
with
their
defendants
and
they
said,
“well
the
stein
procedure
is
not
fair.
we
just
can't
get
a
fair
shake”
but
i
do
not
see
that
in
the
petitions
themselves
and
even
if
they
were
in
the
petitions,
because
all
we
have
in
the
petition
is
citations
to
jackson
against
denno
accept
for
richardson
who
doesn't
even
make
this
claim,
so
in
his
case,
it's
not
before
the
court,
but
even
if
they
were,
some
are
resourceful
defendant
were
to
listen
to
my
argument
and
comeback
into
a
federal
court
with
these
factual
allegations,
i
would
say
again
these
are
immaterial
because
these
convictions
were
based
upon
pleas
of
guilty
not
upon
evidence.
and
when
these
defendants
pleaded
guilty,
it
was
understood
by
everyone
in
the
courtroom,
including
every
member
of
this
court
that
the
new
york
procedure
was
not
fundamentally
unfair.
now,
the
problem
is
raised,
well
perhaps
an
innocent
man
might
be
coerced
into
pleading
by
some
improperly
obtained
evidence
and
we
can't
tolerate
having
people
in
prison
under
those
circumstances.
perhaps
the
police
deliberately
perjured
themselves
in
testifying
at
a
preliminary
stage
of
a
case
and
faced
with
that
the
defendant
had
no
choice.
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
where
we
would
have
merely
allegations
those
are
the
reasons
we
have
trials
and
either
we
maintain
the
practice
of
accepting
pleas
of
guilty
or
we
have
trials
in
every
case.
if
there
is
a
risk
of
an
innocent
man
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
i
think
it
was,
your
honor
who
ask
or
suggested
that
perhaps
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
now,
then
i
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
then
i
think
that
plea
should
be
vacated
and
i'm
talking
about
a
case
where
the
man
admits
his
guilt
and
he
pleads
guilty
because
after
consulting
with
his
counsel,
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
guilty,
he
will
admit
it
in
court,
his
conviction
will
be
based
on
that
plea
and
it
just
isn't
worth
a
contest,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
other
allegations
in
these
petitions.
first,
that
of
mr.
richardson
because
he
attempts
in
a
way
to
get
under
this
rubric
and
say
that
his
attorney
just
completely
failed
to
protect
him
against
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession.
when
mr.
richardson
pleaded
guilty,
the
colloquy
situs
precluded
the
dangers
suggested
in
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
as
reflected
on
pages
90
and
91
of
the
appendix,
the
court
inquiry
of
mr.
richardson,
“did
you
discuss
this
case
fully
with
mr.
mccooe
and
mr.
rosner,”
those
was
his
assigned
counsel,
“yes
sir,
i
did.”
“did
you
understand
them
when
you
spoke
to
them
about
your
case?”
“yes
sir.”
the
court
then
established
that
there
were
no
threats
made
to
induce
the
plea
and
no
promises
from
a
long
list
of
public
officials.
now,
the
court
inquires,
“did
you
commit
this
crime?”
“now,
did
you
on
or
about
march
24,
1963
in
the
county
of
new
york
willfully
and
feloniously
strike
rosalie
smith
with
a
knife
there
by
causing
her
death?”
if
we
have
a
danger
of
innocent
man
pleading
guilty
then
the
way
to
attack
that
is
in
the
colloquy
of
pleading
to
protect
the
pleading
procedure
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
bargain
case
by
this
court
and
in
the
mccarthy
case
interpreting
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
but
in
neither
of
those
cases
was
there
one
bit
of
a
suggestion
that
this
colloquy,
this
protection
of
the
defendant
must
include
any
inquiry
whatsoever
from
the
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
with
respect
to
the
other
allegation
in
these
petitions
which
include
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
a
judicial
threat
to
induce
a
plea,
our
basic
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
deprived
the
district
court
of
a
sound
discretion
when
it
overruled
the
denial
of
these
allegations
without
a
hearing
and
if
there
is
to
be
no
finality
in
criminal
cases,
no
end
to
litigation
after
a
conviction,
then
there
should
be
no
end
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
courts
who
are
in
the
front
lines
and
their
colleagues
in
the
state
courts
reviewing
post-conviction
claims
for
relief.
it
is
established
that
if
a
claim
in
post-conviction
proceedings
is
vague,
conclusory
or
palpably
incredible
then
it
can
be
denied
without
a
hearing
and
that
was
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
three
cases
without
dwelling
at
too
great
length
on
the
specific
facts.
mr.
richardson
who
claims
ineffective
assistance
in
counsel
in
objecting
to
this
coerced
confession,
in
his
petition
in
the
district
court
merely
made
conclusory
allegations
at
pages
a78
and
a82
and
surely
there
is
nothing
stated
there
which
overcomes
the
colloquy
which
i
read
to
your
honors.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
otherwise.
they
didn't
order
a
hearing
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
district
court.
they
ordered
a
hearing
on
a
supplementary
affidavit
that
was
attached
to
the
appellate
brief
in
the
second
circuit
in
complete
disregard
for
the
orderly
procedures
of
federal
habeas
corpus,
and
this
was
over
the
objection
of
the
state
which
we
reassert
in
this
court
that
this
matter
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
was
not
presented
to
the
district
court
and
it
was
not
presented
to
the
state
courts
and
therefore
the
relator
had
not
exhausted
his
available
state
remedies.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
it
was
attached
to
the
appellate
brief
in
1968.
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
denied
in
1965.
now,
in
1966
we
gather
from
the
briefs
that
mr.
richardson
applied
to
the
second
circuit
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
there
for
the
first
time
he
made
an
allegation
that
his
--
which
is
repeated
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
that
is
attorney
told
him
that
by
pleading
guilty,
he
would
not
give
up
disclaim
of
the
coerced
confession.
i
don't
have
that.
it
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
that
is
still
part
of
the
appellate
process
that
was
not
before
the
district
court.
now,
our
position
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that's
why
as
i
was
about
to
say
even
if
the
allegations
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
are
true
and
not
that
they
present
the
picture
of
an
outstanding
member
of
the
bar,
but
if
they
are
true
they
still
do
not
state
a
claim
for
federal
relief
because
they
do
not
show
that
this
man
was
completely
without
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
length
of
the
deliberations
and
consultations
with
his
counsel
which
are
alleged
to
be
too
short
are
not
the
test
of
the
effective
representation.
not
only
that,
but
the
supplementary
affidavit
is
contradicted
by
the
record.
it's
contradicted
by
the
pleading
minutes
and
there
is
no
explanation
why
mr.
richardson
after
allegedly
having
been
told
by
his
attorney
that
he
could
test
his
confession
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
waited
for
a
minimum
of
two-and-a-half
years
before
attempting
to
do
so
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
dash
was
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing
by
the
second
circuit
on
an
allegation
that
when
he
appeared
in
court
for
pleading,
the
judge
threatened
him
off
the
record
with
the
maximum
sentence
if
he
went
to
trial
and
was
convicted.
now,
if
that
were
true,
it
would
establish
a
ground
in
new
york
state
for
a
hearing
--
for
relief.
new
york
is
very,
very
careful
to
preclude
judicial
threats,
but
11
new
york
state
judges
before
the
district
court
passed
on
that
petition
and
said
there
is
not
enough
substance
here
for
a
hearing
that
included
the
coram
nobis
court,
five
judges
of
the
appellate
division
and
five
of
the
seven
judges
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
this
was
a
sound
exercise
of
discretion
because
the
defendant
had
waited
for
more
than
three
years
before
he
brought
this
claim.
it
was
totally
unsubstantiated
by
any
affidavit
from
his
attorney
and
it
was
contradicted
in
the
state
proceedings
by
the
affidavit
of
the
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
there
were
two
dissents
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
dash
case
on
this
issue
of
the
allegation
as
to
threat.
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
holding
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
hearing
as
to
the
claim
of
a
coerced
confession
and
in
that
they
were
reversed
by
the
court
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
was
a
brief
opinion
written
which
reaffirmed
long
standing
new
york
law.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
judges
full
and
burke
i
believe
and
it
was
clear
why
dash
brought
this
petition
as
he
explains
in
his
motion
papers,
his
co-defendants,
waterman
and
devine,
who
were
elected
to
go
to
trial
received
ultimate
relief
on
appeal
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
changed
the
law
relating
to
their
right
to
counsel
after
indictment
during
interrogation.
there
was
no
finding
that
these
confessions
of
waterman
and
devine
were
coerced,
but
the
court
of
appeals
anticipated
the
messiah
decision
of
this
court.
now
those
men,
waterman
and
devine,
had
an
opportunity
before
jackson
against
denno.
they
contested
their
confessions
and
they
want
them
at
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
but
they
attempted
that
but
they
did
at
least
establish
a
record
and
they
won.
and
mr.
dash
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
but
the
new
york
rule
was
not
applied,
i
don't
think
at
this
time
it
was
applied
retroactively
and
to
my
knowledge
the
messiah
case
has
not
been
either,
so
that
i
don't
think
that
would
give
mr.
dash
any
relief
but
in
any
case
it
academic,
he
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
williams
petition
was
held
sufficient
for
a
hearing
on
a
claim
which
is
quite
remarkable
at
page
50
in
the
footnote
to
this
habeas
corpus
petition.
it's
introduced
by
the
information
that
six
years
after
the
plea
of
guilty,
mr.
williams'
assigned
counsel
was
disbarred
for
overzealousness
in
a
divorce
case.
now,
when
that
disbarment
notice
was
published,
this
petition,
this
claim
was
raised
in
the
state
court
and
then
in
the
federal
court
that
mr.
davidson
had
just
prior
to
the
plea
advised
the
relator
that
the
charge
to
which
the
d.a.
was
allowing
to
plea
was
a
misdemeanor
not
a
felony
and
that
relator
did
not
discover
the
fact
until
sentenced
on
the
felony.
now,
he
was
sentence
to
seven-and-a-half
to
15
years
for
robbery
in
the
second
degree.
it
is
palpably
incredible
that
he
would
knowing
at
sentencing
discovering
then
that
this
was
not
a
misdemeanor,
wait
for
six
years
before
informing
us
as
to
this
advice
from
counsel,
particularly
a
man
who
was
no
stranger
to
the
criminal
law.
the
alibi
claim
on
which
the
second
circuit
appears
independently
to
have
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
also
vague
and
palpably
incredible.
this
claim
is
that
mr.
williams
told
his
attorney
that
he
had
an
alibi,
that
he
was
out
of
the
jurisdiction
and
the
attorney
disregarded
this.
there
is
no
statement
as
to
where
mr.
williams
was,
there
is
no
corroborating
affidavit
and
williams
waited
in
this
instance
eight
years
before
he
first
informed
any
one
of
this
alibi.
now,
if
this
attorney
had
suggested
a
trial
on
such
an
alibi
then
mr.
williams
would
be
here
saying
that
the
attorney
was
incompetent.
what
is
the
hearing
going
to
be
into
in
the
williams
case
on
this
alibi?
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
hearing?
and
i
think
these
three
petitions
with
their
--
these
additional
allegations
on
which
hearings
have
been
ordered
raise
a
very
serious
question
in
the
administration
of
justice.
how
much
are
we
going
to
ponder
over
past
cases
when
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
currently
in
crisis?
the
wolf
is
at
the
door
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
said
that
we
have
to
go
poking
in
the
chest
in
the
attic
to
see
whether
there
something
amiss
there
and
i
think
that
the
ordering
of
hearings
on
these
allegations
weakens
and
deprecates
the
great
writ.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
as
mrs.
oberman
says,
it's
very
difficult
to
assess
the
competency
of
counsel
and
it's
rarely
required
that
a
federal
court
do
so.
what
i
would
venture
to
say
that
if
mr.
william's
attorney
had
attempted
to
rest
on
alibi
defense
at
trial
on
the
defendant's
fingerprint
record
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
if
mr.
williams
attorney
had
attempted
to
base
an
alibi
defense
at
trial
on
his
client's
fingerprint
record,
then
the
attorney
would
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
appellate
division
long
before
that
divorce
case.
this
fingerprint
record
merely
shows
that
two
persons
with
the
name
william
mckinley
or
williams
mckinley
or
mckinley
williams
were
in
custody,
one
in
ohio
and
the
other
in
new
york
and
it
expressly
states
that
there
are
no
fingerprint
cards
to
support
this
statement.
nor
it
must
we
assume
that
the
richardson
petition
even
with
the
supplementary
affidavit
establishes
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
defendant
richardson
was
charged
with
a
double
killing
by
stabbing,
two
first
degree
murders.
the
attorney
secured
for
him
a
plea
of
guilty
to
one
second
degree
murder
and
your
honors
will
recall
from
the
pleading
colloquy
that
his
client
unequivocally
admitted
his
guilt
of
this
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
was
charged
with
stabbing
to
death
two
people
at
the
same
time,
and
he
admits
in
his
motion
papers
before
this
court
that
the
police
knew
that
three
men
had
seen
him
in
the
company
of
the
deceased
pair
before
they
started
an
altercation
which
led
to
their
death.
he
admits
that
he
had
blood
on
his
clothing
and
he
admits
that
these
people
who
died
were
his
relatives
and
he
further
acknowledges
that
he
gave
the
police
a
false
alibi
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
coercive
tactics
which
he
now
alleges,
and
he
attributes
this
false
alibi
to
his
desire
to
avoid
getting
these
three
men
in
trouble.
further,
mr.
richardson
acknowledges
that
he
did
have
two
conferences
although
they
were
brief
with
his
attorney
respecting
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
and
the
attorney
came
to
a
reasoned
decision
that
it
would
be
best
or
that
it
was
not
--
he
was
not
going
to
succeed
if
he
attempted
to
keep
it
out
of
evidence.
the
only
defense
tendered
to
any
court
at
any
stage
of
the
litigation
against
mr.
richardson,
is
that
in
his
district
court
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
is
surely
a
very
weak
foundation
for
a
defense
to
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
at
the
time
of
the
altercation
mr.
richardson
alleges
involving
these
two
persons
his
relatives,
i
was
the
only
other
person
present
and
when
they
drew
knives
and
started
stabbing
at
each
other
i
tried
to
stop
them
and
break
them
apart
but
i
couldn't,
i
only
succeeded
in
getting
my
clothes
bloody.
they
took
me
to
the
station
house
and
i
tried
to
explain
what
happened
as
far
as
i
knew
and
showed
them
my
bloody
clothes,
then
they
booked
me
on
homicide.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
that
was
new
york
county.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
new
york
county.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
richardson
--
the
petition
was
in
the
northern
district.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
thank
you.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
--
from
the
bench
if
a
defendant
plead
at
guilty
prior
to
the
bruton
decision,
he
may
not
now
come
forward
and
say
that
he
was
induced
to
plead
because
he
expected
that
his
co-defendants'
confession
would
be
introduced
and
the
jury
would
hear
it
and
that
would
prejudice
him.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it's
difficult
to
understand
precisely
how
far
the
second
circuit
would
go,
but
i
think
that
is
a
logical
outcome
of
much
of
the
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit
and
i
think
it's
intolerable
--
it
is
an
intolerable
outcome.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
new
york
state
appears
to
be
the
only
jurisdiction
in
america
in
which
there
can
be
a
pre-trial
hearing
as
to
admissibility
of
confessions
and
the
defendant
may
preserve
his
claim
of
coercion
on
appeal
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
has
the
option
of
withdrawing
his
plea
and
going
to
trial
or
negotiating
a
lesser
plea,
but
at
his
option,
the
judgment
of
conviction
is
vacated.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
time
limit
is
the
normal
appellate
process.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
this
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
in
1965,
about
six
months
after
the
jackson
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
the
hearings
include
the
issue
of
confession,
i
would
assume,
in
every
jurisdiction
but
only
in
new
york
is
that
issue
preserved
on
appeal
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
the
logical
outcome
perhaps
of
the
second
circuit
opinion
read
in
its
broadest
sense
is
to
require
the
new
york
procedure
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
be
enacted
in
every
jurisdiction
because
the
logical
outcome
indeed
of
the
second
circuit
position
and
apparently
of
the
relators'
arguments
is
that
if
evidence
is
obtained
by
police
in
an
illegal
manner,
there
really
is
no
way
that
a
contested
hearing
on
issues
of
fact
can
be
avoided
even
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
here,
we
have
merely
allegations
of
coercion
of
the
confessions
unsupported
by
anything
outside
of
the
petitioner's
own
motions,
but
even
assuming
the
truth
of
these
allegations,
there
is
no
connection,
there
is
no
nexus
in
a
constitutional
sense
between
this
alleged
coercion
and
the
plea
of
guilty.
so
long
as
the
defendant
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
prior
to
the
entry
of
judgment
to
raise
these
constitutional
claims
and
indeed
the
expansion
of
the
list
of
these
claims
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
requires
that
we
maintain
the
time
honored
orderly
procedures
for
presenting
these
claims
whether
they
involved
confessions
or
tangible
evidence
or
eyewitness
identification.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
nexus
in
the
allegation
that
a
plea
of
guilty
was
induced
by
the
threatened
use
of
a
coerced
confession.
that
is
merely
a
legal
fiction
which
states
the
conclusion
to
be
reached
but
that
is
not
a
step
in
the
reasoning.
there
is
no
claim
factually
in
these
cases
that
the
relators
were
told
by
any
public
official
that
these
confessions
known
to
be
coerced
by
the
state
were
going
to
be
use
against
them
and
for
that
reason
they
had
better
plead
guilty.
these
were
self-motivated
pleas
of
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
second
possible
nexus
between
the
coerced
confession
and
the
plea
of
guilty
and
that
is
the
suggested
nexus
of
incompetency
of
counsel.
if
the
attorney
consulting
with
his
client
as
is
admitted
to
have
occurred
in
each
one
of
these
cases
consulting
with
his
client
as
to
the
prospects
for
suppressing
this
confession
knowing
as
is
admitted
in
each
one
of
these
cases
by
the
relators
that
they
had
a
opportunity
--
they
had
a
procedure
by
which
they
could
keep
this
confession
out
of
evidence
and
if
after
those
deliberations,
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
reach
the
considered
judgment
that
it
would
be
the
bet
to
the
best
interest
of
the
defendant
to
accept
an
offer
of
a
lesser
plea
and
to
forgo
the
trial
then
that
decisions
should
be
binding.
that
is
what
a
plea
of
guilty
is
all
about.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
the
relators
are
striving
to
find
some
kind
of
a
constitutionally
acceptable
theory
on
which
they
can
connect
this
confession.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
as
i
suggest
it
has
been
used
in
many
contexts
and
i'm
just
trying
to
pinpoint
that.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
to
me
i
would
say
that
a
nexus
is
some
constitutionally
acceptable
reason
why
the
plea
of
guilty
should
not
be
considered
binding.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
no,
and
i
think
that
in
such
a
nexus
would
include
the
following.
one
would
be
that
the
advice
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
a
chance.
it's
just
a
statement
of
the
conclusion.
nexus
means
under
what
circumstances
will
we
allow
a
defendant
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
some
relationship.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
could
mean
a
factual
connection.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
to
me,
it
means
a
factual
connection.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
means
a
continuation
of
the
coercion
that
was
addressed
in
the
station
house
to
the
defendant,
a
continuation
of
that
coercion
into
the
courtroom.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
and
that
is
not
alleged
in
these
cases.
that
is
not
alleged
in
these
cases
or
per
--
and
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
other
than
that
to
take
out
of
our
--
to
take
out
this
case
the
dispositive
fact
that
these
defendants
had
attorneys
who
with
the
relators
made
a
reasoned
choice
to
forgo
their
constitutional
challenges
as
long
as
there's
nothing
to
remove
that
then
the
plea
of
guilty
should
mean
what
it
says,
i
am
guilty,
though
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
now,
it
seems
apparent
from
the
decisions
in
the
states
and
in,
i
would
say,
all
of
the
circuits
that
this
is
assumed
to
be
the
case
with
the
search
and
seizure
claims
where
there
is
an
attack
in
post-conviction
proceedings
on
the
admissibility
of
tangible
evidence
after
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
i
don't
see
why
there
should
be
any
difference
when
we
come
to
the
confession
claim
other
than
the
perhaps
emotionally
significant
fact
that
both
the
plea
of
guilty
and
the
confession
are
oral,
but
if
there
is
a
break
in
the
chain
of
events
between
the
station
house
interrogation
and
the
plea
of
guilty
as
there
is
in
each
one
of
these
cases
then
that
fact
that
these
are
both
oral
is
completely
immaterial.
there
is
an
independent
act
of
free
will
exercised
by
these
defendants
when
they
decided
to
forgo
their
trial.
the
cat
was
not
out
of
the
bag
when
they
allegedly
confessed
in
the
station
house.
now,
if
a
defendant
is
coerced
into
confessing
by
the
police
and
subsequently
while
in
custody
he
makes
another
confession,
that
second
confession
maybe
admissible
at
a
trial
even
though
in
a
sense
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
if
the
facts
established
that
there
was
a
break
in
the
chain
of
events
and
that
the
second
confession
was
voluntary
and
came
after
the
defendant
was
aware
of
his
rights.
well,
in
our
case
the
confession,
the
cat
is
not
out
of
the
bag
at
all
because
that
the
defendant
aided
by
counsel
is
still
armed
with
the
power
to
try
to
keep
that
cat
in
the
bag.
he
just
says
that
it's
not
worth
my
trying
for
various
reasons
and
so
long
as
the
state
or
the
federal
government
does
not
unnecessarily
discourage
the
opportunity
of
the
defendant
to
challenge
these
pieces
of
evidence
then
his
decision
not
to
do
so
should
be
binding.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
it
could
enter
into
the
picture
if
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
are
actually,
factually
motivated
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
on
the
feeling
that
they
just
can't
get
a
fair
trial,
they
just
can't
get
a
fair
hearing.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
the
first
obligation
is
to
allege
it
before
such
a
hearing
should
be
ordered.
we
cannot
just
presume
it.
i
think
indeed
it
would
be
unreasonable
mr.
justice
marshall
to
presume
that
because
i
think
in
common
sense
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
there
is
no
reason
to
believe.
it's
purely
speculative
to
say
that
this
difference
between
the
stein
procedure,
the
pre-jackson
procedure
and
the
post-jackson
procedure
compelled
this
defendant
or
unnecessarily
encouraged
him
to
forgo
the
trial.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
tried
and
he
prevailed
in
the
second
circuit,
but
i
think
that
with
all
respect
to
the
opinion
of
judge
kaufman,
it
is
not
persuasive
and
it
does
not
overcome
the
fact
that
there
was
no
factual
allegation.
it
just
doesn't
overcome
the
dissent
of
judge
friendly.
now,
that
the
relators
here
in
this
court,
the
way
their
brief
is
written
urge
on
the
court
this
factual
connection,
this
actual,
factual
motivation
entering
into
the
minds
of
counsel
that
they
sat
down
with
their
defendants
and
they
said,
“well
the
stein
procedure
is
not
fair.
we
just
can't
get
a
fair
shake”
but
i
do
not
see
that
in
the
petitions
themselves
and
even
if
they
were
in
the
petitions,
because
all
we
have
in
the
petition
is
citations
to
jackson
against
denno
accept
for
richardson
who
doesn't
even
make
this
claim,
so
in
his
case,
it's
not
before
the
court,
but
even
if
they
were,
some
are
resourceful
defendant
were
to
listen
to
my
argument
and
comeback
into
a
federal
court
with
these
factual
allegations,
i
would
say
again
these
are
immaterial
because
these
convictions
were
based
upon
pleas
of
guilty
not
upon
evidence.
and
when
these
defendants
pleaded
guilty,
it
was
understood
by
everyone
in
the
courtroom,
including
every
member
of
this
court
that
the
new
york
procedure
was
not
fundamentally
unfair.
now,
the
problem
is
raised,
well
perhaps
an
innocent
man
might
be
coerced
into
pleading
by
some
improperly
obtained
evidence
and
we
can't
tolerate
having
people
in
prison
under
those
circumstances.
perhaps
the
police
deliberately
perjured
themselves
in
testifying
at
a
preliminary
stage
of
a
case
and
faced
with
that
the
defendant
had
no
choice.
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
where
we
would
have
merely
allegations
those
are
the
reasons
we
have
trials
and
either
we
maintain
the
practice
of
accepting
pleas
of
guilty
or
we
have
trials
in
every
case.
if
there
is
a
risk
of
an
innocent
man
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
i
think
it
was,
your
honor
who
ask
or
suggested
that
perhaps
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
now,
then
i
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
then
i
think
that
plea
should
be
vacated
and
i'm
talking
about
a
case
where
the
man
admits
his
guilt
and
he
pleads
guilty
because
after
consulting
with
his
counsel,
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
guilty,
he
will
admit
it
in
court,
his
conviction
will
be
based
on
that
plea
and
it
just
isn't
worth
a
contest,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
other
allegations
in
these
petitions.
first,
that
of
mr.
richardson
because
he
attempts
in
a
way
to
get
under
this
rubric
and
say
that
his
attorney
just
completely
failed
to
protect
him
against
the
use
of
a
coerced
confession.
when
mr.
richardson
pleaded
guilty,
the
colloquy
situs
precluded
the
dangers
suggested
in
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
as
reflected
on
pages
90
and
91
of
the
appendix,
the
court
inquiry
of
mr.
richardson,
“did
you
discuss
this
case
fully
with
mr.
mccooe
and
mr.
rosner,”
those
was
his
assigned
counsel,
“yes
sir,
i
did.”
“did
you
understand
them
when
you
spoke
to
them
about
your
case?”
“yes
sir.”
the
court
then
established
that
there
were
no
threats
made
to
induce
the
plea
and
no
promises
from
a
long
list
of
public
officials.
now,
the
court
inquires,
“did
you
commit
this
crime?”
“now,
did
you
on
or
about
march
24,
1963
in
the
county
of
new
york
willfully
and
feloniously
strike
rosalie
smith
with
a
knife
there
by
causing
her
death?”
if
we
have
a
danger
of
innocent
man
pleading
guilty
then
the
way
to
attack
that
is
in
the
colloquy
of
pleading
to
protect
the
pleading
procedure
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
bargain
case
by
this
court
and
in
the
mccarthy
case
interpreting
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
but
in
neither
of
those
cases
was
there
one
bit
of
a
suggestion
that
this
colloquy,
this
protection
of
the
defendant
must
include
any
inquiry
whatsoever
from
the
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
with
respect
to
the
other
allegation
in
these
petitions
which
include
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
a
judicial
threat
to
induce
a
plea,
our
basic
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
deprived
the
district
court
of
a
sound
discretion
when
it
overruled
the
denial
of
these
allegations
without
a
hearing
and
if
there
is
to
be
no
finality
in
criminal
cases,
no
end
to
litigation
after
a
conviction,
then
there
should
be
no
end
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
courts
who
are
in
the
front
lines
and
their
colleagues
in
the
state
courts
reviewing
post-conviction
claims
for
relief.
it
is
established
that
if
a
claim
in
post-conviction
proceedings
is
vague,
conclusory
or
palpably
incredible
then
it
can
be
denied
without
a
hearing
and
that
was
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
three
cases
without
dwelling
at
too
great
length
on
the
specific
facts.
mr.
richardson
who
claims
ineffective
assistance
in
counsel
in
objecting
to
this
coerced
confession,
in
his
petition
in
the
district
court
merely
made
conclusory
allegations
at
pages
a78
and
a82
and
surely
there
is
nothing
stated
there
which
overcomes
the
colloquy
which
i
read
to
your
honors.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
otherwise.
they
didn't
order
a
hearing
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
the
district
court.
they
ordered
a
hearing
on
a
supplementary
affidavit
that
was
attached
to
the
appellate
brief
in
the
second
circuit
in
complete
disregard
for
the
orderly
procedures
of
federal
habeas
corpus,
and
this
was
over
the
objection
of
the
state
which
we
reassert
in
this
court
that
this
matter
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
was
not
presented
to
the
district
court
and
it
was
not
presented
to
the
state
courts
and
therefore
the
relator
had
not
exhausted
his
available
state
remedies.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
it
was
attached
to
the
appellate
brief
in
1968.
the
habeas
corpus
petition
was
denied
in
1965.
now,
in
1966
we
gather
from
the
briefs
that
mr.
richardson
applied
to
the
second
circuit
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
there
for
the
first
time
he
made
an
allegation
that
his
--
which
is
repeated
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
that
is
attorney
told
him
that
by
pleading
guilty,
he
would
not
give
up
disclaim
of
the
coerced
confession.
i
don't
have
that.
it
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
that
is
still
part
of
the
appellate
process
that
was
not
before
the
district
court.
now,
our
position
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
that's
why
as
i
was
about
to
say
even
if
the
allegations
in
the
supplementary
affidavit
are
true
and
not
that
they
present
the
picture
of
an
outstanding
member
of
the
bar,
but
if
they
are
true
they
still
do
not
state
a
claim
for
federal
relief
because
they
do
not
show
that
this
man
was
completely
without
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
length
of
the
deliberations
and
consultations
with
his
counsel
which
are
alleged
to
be
too
short
are
not
the
test
of
the
effective
representation.
not
only
that,
but
the
supplementary
affidavit
is
contradicted
by
the
record.
it's
contradicted
by
the
pleading
minutes
and
there
is
no
explanation
why
mr.
richardson
after
allegedly
having
been
told
by
his
attorney
that
he
could
test
his
confession
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
waited
for
a
minimum
of
two-and-a-half
years
before
attempting
to
do
so
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
dash
was
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing
by
the
second
circuit
on
an
allegation
that
when
he
appeared
in
court
for
pleading,
the
judge
threatened
him
off
the
record
with
the
maximum
sentence
if
he
went
to
trial
and
was
convicted.
now,
if
that
were
true,
it
would
establish
a
ground
in
new
york
state
for
a
hearing
--
for
relief.
new
york
is
very,
very
careful
to
preclude
judicial
threats,
but
11
new
york
state
judges
before
the
district
court
passed
on
that
petition
and
said
there
is
not
enough
substance
here
for
a
hearing
that
included
the
coram
nobis
court,
five
judges
of
the
appellate
division
and
five
of
the
seven
judges
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
this
was
a
sound
exercise
of
discretion
because
the
defendant
had
waited
for
more
than
three
years
before
he
brought
this
claim.
it
was
totally
unsubstantiated
by
any
affidavit
from
his
attorney
and
it
was
contradicted
in
the
state
proceedings
by
the
affidavit
of
the
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
there
were
two
dissents
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
dash
case
on
this
issue
of
the
allegation
as
to
threat.
the
court
of
appeals
was
unanimous
in
holding
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
hearing
as
to
the
claim
of
a
coerced
confession
and
in
that
they
were
reversed
by
the
court
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
was
a
brief
opinion
written
which
reaffirmed
long
standing
new
york
law.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
judges
full
and
burke
i
believe
and
it
was
clear
why
dash
brought
this
petition
as
he
explains
in
his
motion
papers,
his
co-defendants,
waterman
and
devine,
who
were
elected
to
go
to
trial
received
ultimate
relief
on
appeal
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
changed
the
law
relating
to
their
right
to
counsel
after
indictment
during
interrogation.
there
was
no
finding
that
these
confessions
of
waterman
and
devine
were
coerced,
but
the
court
of
appeals
anticipated
the
messiah
decision
of
this
court.
now
those
men,
waterman
and
devine,
had
an
opportunity
before
jackson
against
denno.
they
contested
their
confessions
and
they
want
them
at
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
but
they
attempted
that
but
they
did
at
least
establish
a
record
and
they
won.
and
mr.
dash
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
but
the
new
york
rule
was
not
applied,
i
don't
think
at
this
time
it
was
applied
retroactively
and
to
my
knowledge
the
messiah
case
has
not
been
either,
so
that
i
don't
think
that
would
give
mr.
dash
any
relief
but
in
any
case
it
academic,
he
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
williams
petition
was
held
sufficient
for
a
hearing
on
a
claim
which
is
quite
remarkable
at
page
50
in
the
footnote
to
this
habeas
corpus
petition.
it's
introduced
by
the
information
that
six
years
after
the
plea
of
guilty,
mr.
williams'
assigned
counsel
was
disbarred
for
overzealousness
in
a
divorce
case.
now,
when
that
disbarment
notice
was
published,
this
petition,
this
claim
was
raised
in
the
state
court
and
then
in
the
federal
court
that
mr.
davidson
had
just
prior
to
the
plea
advised
the
relator
that
the
charge
to
which
the
d.a.
was
allowing
to
plea
was
a
misdemeanor
not
a
felony
and
that
relator
did
not
discover
the
fact
until
sentenced
on
the
felony.
now,
he
was
sentence
to
seven-and-a-half
to
15
years
for
robbery
in
the
second
degree.
it
is
palpably
incredible
that
he
would
knowing
at
sentencing
discovering
then
that
this
was
not
a
misdemeanor,
wait
for
six
years
before
informing
us
as
to
this
advice
from
counsel,
particularly
a
man
who
was
no
stranger
to
the
criminal
law.
the
alibi
claim
on
which
the
second
circuit
appears
independently
to
have
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
also
vague
and
palpably
incredible.
this
claim
is
that
mr.
williams
told
his
attorney
that
he
had
an
alibi,
that
he
was
out
of
the
jurisdiction
and
the
attorney
disregarded
this.
there
is
no
statement
as
to
where
mr.
williams
was,
there
is
no
corroborating
affidavit
and
williams
waited
in
this
instance
eight
years
before
he
first
informed
any
one
of
this
alibi.
now,
if
this
attorney
had
suggested
a
trial
on
such
an
alibi
then
mr.
williams
would
be
here
saying
that
the
attorney
was
incompetent.
what
is
the
hearing
going
to
be
into
in
the
williams
case
on
this
alibi?
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
hearing?
and
i
think
these
three
petitions
with
their
--
these
additional
allegations
on
which
hearings
have
been
ordered
raise
a
very
serious
question
in
the
administration
of
justice.
how
much
are
we
going
to
ponder
over
past
cases
when
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
currently
in
crisis?
the
wolf
is
at
the
door
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
said
that
we
have
to
go
poking
in
the
chest
in
the
attic
to
see
whether
there
something
amiss
there
and
i
think
that
the
ordering
of
hearings
on
these
allegations
weakens
and
deprecates
the
great
writ.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
as
mrs.
oberman
says,
it's
very
difficult
to
assess
the
competency
of
counsel
and
it's
rarely
required
that
a
federal
court
do
so.
what
i
would
venture
to
say
that
if
mr.
william's
attorney
had
attempted
to
rest
on
alibi
defense
at
trial
on
the
defendant's
fingerprint
record
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
if
mr.
williams
attorney
had
attempted
to
base
an
alibi
defense
at
trial
on
his
client's
fingerprint
record,
then
the
attorney
would
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
appellate
division
long
before
that
divorce
case.
this
fingerprint
record
merely
shows
that
two
persons
with
the

william
mckinley
or
williams
mckinley
or
mckinley
williams
were
in
custody,
one
in
ohio
and
the
other
in
new
york
and
it
expressly
states
that
there
are
no
fingerprint
cards
to
support
this
statement.
nor
it
must
we
assume
that
the
richardson
petition
even
with
the
supplementary
affidavit
establishes
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
defendant
richardson
was
charged
with
a
double
killing
by
stabbing,
two
first
degree
murders.
the
attorney
secured
for
him
a
plea
of
guilty
to
one
second
degree
murder
and
your
honors
will
recall
from
the
pleading
colloquy
that
his
client
unequivocally
admitted
his
guilt
of
this
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
he
was
charged
with
stabbing
to
death
two
people
at
the
same
time,
and
he
admits
in
his
motion
papers
before
this
court
that
the
police
knew
that
three
men
had
seen
him
in
the
company
of
the
deceased
pair
before
they
started
an
altercation
which
led
to
their
death.
he
admits
that
he
had
blood
on
his
clothing
and
he
admits
that
these
people
who
died
were
his
relatives
and
he
further
acknowledges
that
he
gave
the
police
a
false
alibi
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
coercive
tactics
which
he
now
alleges,
and
he
attributes
this
false
alibi
to
his
desire
to
avoid
getting
these
three
men
in
trouble.
further,
mr.
richardson
acknowledges
that
he
did
have
two
conferences
although
they
were
brief
with
his
attorney
respecting
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
and
the
attorney
came
to
a
reasoned
decision
that
it
would
be
best
or
that
it
was
not
--
he
was
not
going
to
succeed
if
he
attempted
to
keep
it
out
of
evidence.
the
only
defense
tendered
to
any
court
at
any
stage
of
the
litigation
against
mr.
richardson,
is
that
in
his
district
court
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
is
surely
a
very
weak
foundation
for
a
defense
to
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
at
the
time
of
the
altercation
mr.
richardson
alleges
involving
these
two
persons
his
relatives,
i
was
the
only
other
person
present
and
when
they
drew
knives
and
started
stabbing
at
each
other
i
tried
to
stop
them
and
break
them
apart
but
i
couldn't,
i
only
succeeded
in
getting
my
clothes
bloody.
they
took
me
to
the
station
house
and
i
tried
to
explain
what
happened
as
far
as
i
knew
and
showed
them
my
bloody
clothes,
then
they
booked
me
on
homicide.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
that
was
new
york
county.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes,
new
york
county.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no,
richardson
--
the
petition
was
in
the
northern
district.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
thank
you.
