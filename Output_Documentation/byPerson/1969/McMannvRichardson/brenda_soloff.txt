ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
a
guilty
plea
can
be
opened
up
to
collateral
attack
in
order
to
test
in
evidentiary
defense
which
could
have
been
tested
at
a
trial.
these
are
three
habeas
corpus
petition
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
on
the
petitions
of
state
prisoners
who
are
detained
by
virtue
of
their
pleas
of
guilty.
the
district
courts
which
initially
considered
these
habeas
petitions,
declined
to
order
such
hearing
because
the
primary
allegation
of
each
relator
that
a
coerced
confession
had
been
obtained
from
him
was
not
the
direct
attack
on
a
guilty
plea
itself.
biased
decisions
in
these
cases,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
confessions
which
weren't
introduced
against
a
relator
nevertheless
can
be
attacked
collaterally.
i
will
address
myself
primarily
to
the
nature
of
a
plea
of
guilty
as
precluding
a
subsequent
attack
on
the
admissibility
of
potential
evidence.
mr.
juviler
of
the
office
of
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
will
also
discuss
this
issue.
and
in
addition
to
claiming
that
a
coerced
confession
was
used
against
him,
each
of
these
relators
makes
other
allegations
on
which
the
second
circuit
has
also
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
and
mr.
juviler
will
discuss
those
allegations
as
well.
these
three
men
were
all
convicted
in
new
york
state
of
serious
crimes
following
their
pleas
of
guilty.
all
three
were
represented
by
counsel,
all
of
them
pleaded
guilty
to
substantially
reduced
charges.
richardson
satisfied
two
first
degree
murder
charges
by
his
plea
to
one
charge
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
after
a
plea
to
murder
on
the
first
degree
had
been
rejected
in
his
behalf.
dash
satisfied
indictment
charging
with
robbery
in
the
first
degree
by
pleading
guilty
to
robbery
in
the
second
degree
after
he
personally
rejected
a
guilty
plea
to
the
higher
charge
and
williams
satisfied
an
indictment
charging
robbery
and
rape
for
the
first
degree
with
his
guilty
plea
to
robbery
in
the
second
degree.
none
of
these
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
pleas.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
proceedings
in
the
richardson
case
are
in
the
record.
the
proceedings
in
the
dash
and
williams
cases
are
not
in
the
record
because
they
were
not
before
the
circuit
court.
there's
some
question
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
before
the
district
courts.
it
appears
to
me
from
reading
each
district
court
opinion
in
those
two
cases
that
they
did
have
those
minutes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
it's
more
than
relevant
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
second
circuit
decision
that
they
place
absolutely
no
weight
on
the
one
colloquy
which
they
did
have
before
them
which
was
a
model
of
inquiry.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
the
richardson.
it
was
most
thorough
inquiry
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
that's
in
the
appendix
at
pages
88
through
97.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
was
not
going
to.
i
would
like
to
follow
at
that
thought
for
a
moment
there
because
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
these
cases
is
that
no
matter
how
we
look
at
these
petitions
and
at
the
second
circuit
decision,
no
colloquy
even
the
one
in
richardson
could
ever
satisfy
the
issue
raised
in
these
cases.
after
the
judgments
of
conviction
became
final
in
these
cases,
each
of
these
relators
sought
collateral
relief
in
new
york
by
coram
nobis
which
is
a
post-conviction
procedure
in
new
york
for
testing
claims
which
are
not
apparent
in
the
face
of
the
record.
relief
was
denied
in
each
case
without
a
hearing
and
the
denials
were
affirmed
by
the
state
appellate
courts.
then
each
relator
sought
federal
habeas
corpus,
claiming
essentially
that
he
after
his
arrest
he
gave
a
coerced
confession.
after
the
district
courts
had
dismissed
these
petitions
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
in
three
separate
opinions.
the
dash
case
was
part
of
en
banc
decision,
richardson
was
decided
to
the
same
day
and
williams
about
a
month
later.
basically,
the
majority
opinion
held
in
the
second
circuit
that
where
a
claim
is
made
that
evidence
was
illegally
obtained
and
where
it
is
also
maintained
that
the
existence
and
threatened
use
of
that
evidence
at
a
trial
substantially
motivated
a
plea
of
guilty,
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
evidentiary
hearing
to
test
his
claims
--
to
test
his
claims
that
his
confession
was
coerced
that
his
plea
was
involuntary,
that
his
plea
was
substantially
motivated
by
the
allegedly
coerced
confession
that
hold
the
whole
range
of
allegations.
we
think
that
in
rendering
these
decisions,
the
court
of
appeals
has
seriously
misinterpreted
the
significance
of
a
plea
of
guilty.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
does.
the
hearing
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
second
circuit
contemplates
hearings
without
there
having
been
states
hearings,
that's
right
or
without
certainly
there
having
been
pre-plea
state
hearings.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
would
open
up
its
doors
to
these
petitions
if
this
case
were
affirmed
is
another
issue.
the
convictions
here
because
they
are
based
on
pleas
of
guilty,
don't
rest
on
any
evidence.
no
evidence
was
used
against
these
relators
at
a
trial
and
this
has
occurred
because
each
relator
after
consulting
with
counsel
decided
to
forgo
a
trail
and
all
the
contest
of
fact
that
that
decision
by
definition
involves.
each
instead
deliberately
choose
to
have
their
convictions
rest
solely
on
their
pleas
of
guilty
in
open
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
just
an
allegation.
it's
never
--
we
haven't
seen
any
confessions,
we
don't
know
if
they're
written.
i
believe
each
one
may
state
that
they're
written,
i'm
not
sure,
maybe
oral.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
the
state
can
verify
this
in
anyway.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
as
the
practical
matter
i
don't
know
how
beyond
his
own
word,
a
petitioner
would
establish
that
he
made
a
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
know
with
the
practice
is
with
respect
to
each
county
district
attorney
as
to
how
long
they
keep
files
and
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
for
example
a
policeman's
memo
book
which
may
contain
the
only
statement
which
was
ever
made
would
be
preserved
by
the
policeman
or
how
long
he
would
be
able
to
read
his
notes
or
if
they
were
ever
turned
over
to
the
district
attorney.
there's
a
whole
initial
problem
in
these
cases
as
to
ever
establishing
that
a
confession
existed,
let
alone
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
given
and
the
scope
of
their
confession
whether
it
was
in
fact
a
confession
or
a
half
admission
or
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
it
is
the
state's
problem
to
the
extent
that
we
have
to
go
to
hold
hearings
to
get
all
records,
to
get
whatever
witnesses
are
available.
it's
an
extremely
difficult
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
certainly,
he
would
have
the
burden
of
proof,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
turn
back
to
the
state
because
the
state
has
whatever
records
there
are,
if
there
are
any.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
second
circuit
has
not
answered.
they've
said
that
other
allegations
affidavits
should
be
necessary
but
they
didn't
require
it
in
any
of
these
cases
and
we're
already
getting
petitions
which
make
very
bare
assertions
on
which
hearings
have
been
ordered.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
it's
within
the
scope
of
what
the
second
circuit
has
opened
up
along
with
illegally-seized
evidence,
the
claim
that
evidence
was
illegally
seized
along
with
almost
any
evidentiary
claim
which
can
be
made.
i
have
received
a
brief
from
the
office
of
counsel
for
respondent
which
alleges
that
the
plea
was
coerced
because
of
unfair
pre-trial
publicity
and
it
rests
directly,
i
mean
that
the
allegations
are
based
directly
on
this
case
in
the
second
circuit.
so
that
its
ramifications
for
other
kinds
of
opening
up
of
the
plea
are
enormous,
i
think
they're
endless.
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
once
a
decision
has
been
made
to
rest
a
conviction
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
to
take
whatever
benefits
flow
from
that
plea
and
after
years
have
passed
and
the
state
has
relied
on
this
for
years
in
just
the
way
that
we've
describe
that
it
should
not
be
the
relator's
option
to
repudiate
the
plea
because
then
there
is
no
meaning
to
the
plea
of
guilty.
it
only
because
of
a
procedural
step
to
the
testing
of
evidentiary
claims
and
its
significance
as
an
independent
basis
of
conviction
is
completely
negated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
without
meaning
to
be
facetious,
i
have
problems
with
the
rationale
of
the
second
circuit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it
can
be
read
that
if
a
confession
is
coerced
and
if
that
confession,
not
the
coercion
of
the
confession
but
the
confession
itself.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
existence
of
the
confession
substantially
motivated
to
plea
that
is
taking
into
account
whatever
other
evidence
may
have
been
available,
taking
into
account
the
nature
of
the
bargain
that
was
struck,
taking
into
account
any
variety
of
factors.
the
district
court
now
must
weigh
this
and
call
it
substantial
motivation
and
decide
how
substantial
it
was
and
if
it
was
substantial
and
apparently
if
the
confession
was
coerced
then
the
pleas
to
be
set
aside.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
that
that's
their
rationale
of
the
second
circuit.
i
think
they
ran
right
around
the
plea
of
guilty
to
the
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
believe
that
that's
really
so
with
what
--
in
second
circuit
rationale.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
what
the
second
circuit
said,
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
no,
because
i
don't
think
substantial
motivation
means
that.
i
think
all
that
substantial
motivation
means
is
there
was
a
confession,
and
for
some
reason
it
was
coerced,
but
i
didn't
test
it,
instead
because
of
that
confession
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
at
all.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
held.
i
think
that
what
they
said
was
there
was
a
confession
and
it
caused
me
to
plea
guilty.
it
induced
my
plea.
i'm
sorry.
i
am
getting
confused.
it
substantially
motivates
--
the
existence
of
the
confession
substantially
motivated
my
plea.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there's
no
“but-for”
mr.
justice
brennan
has
no
“but-for”
test
announcement
on
the
second
circuit
decision,
that's
the
first
thing.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
problem
in
all
these
cases,
i
agree
that
there
is
a
difference
but
i
think
that
substantial
motivation
or
“but-for”
may
come
down
to
the
same
thing,
but
the
answer
is
still
this
plea
was
entered
in
lieu
of
a
trial.
there
could
have
been
a
trial
and
there
wasn't.
once
the
term
induced
or
substantially
motivated
and
all
of
these
terms
predicated
on
all
go
or
ignore
the
existence
of
the
trial,
they
ignore
the
very
nature
of
a
guilty
plea.
they
ignore
the
fact
that
no
evidence
is
necessary
to
support
the
conviction,
that
the
plea
is
the
independent
basis
and
that
once
you
use
words
like
“substantially
motivated”
or
“induced”
to
reach
out
the
evidentiary
test
you
had
negated
the
plea
of
guilty.
you
simply
said,
first
you
plead
guilty
and
then
we'll
have
this
evidentiary
hearing
when
you
demand
it
at
your
request.
many
years
later,
perhaps,
and
you've
undermined
the
plea
of
guilty
for
which
there
are
certainly
very
great
justification.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
well,
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
allegation
that
a
counsel
is
ineffective
is
certainly
a
ground
on
which
collateral
attack
against
a
plea
of
guilty
can
be
based.
i
would
never
not
argue
to
contrary
but
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
therefore,
i
did
not
knowingly
involuntarily
enter
a
guilty
plea
because
he
did
not
advice
me
of
the
consequences
not
because
i
had
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
he
comes
into
court
and
he
makes
a
long
list
of
acknowledgments
of
guilt
of
the
knowing
nature
of
the
fact.
if
he
made
a
coerced
confession,
and
counsel
didn't
attack
it,
and
he
only
attacks
counsel
on
the
ground
of
not
having
an
attack
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
that's
a
perfectly
competent
piece
of
advice
on
the
part
of
counsel.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
alleges
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
have
no
acknowledged
coerced
confessions
in
these
cases.
we
have
allegations
support.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
may
well
be
a
close
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
confession
is
or
is
not
admissible.
this
is
especially
true
where
coming
up
with
the
right
to
counsel
and
statements
as
to
whether
or
not
warnings
were
given
the
full
range
of
possibility
of
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
once
you
have
a
false
representation
by
an
officer
of
the
state,
you
have
a
collateral
issue.
in
fact,
we
cite
a
case
in
our
brief
in
which
new
york
has
held
that
where
an
officer
testified
falsely
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
but
where
we
have
a
claim
of
coercion
and
an
available
procedure
and
this
is
essentially
what
we're
talking
about
in
these
cases,
then
we
have
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
except
for
where
you
have
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
that's
what
the
plea
of
guilty
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
difference
being
that
once
you
go
to
trail
and
test
a
confession,
the
confession
becomes
a
part
of
the
basis
of
the
judgment
of
conviction.
it
is
evidence
which
probably
led
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
you're
entitled
in
those
circumstances
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
confession
was
coerced.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
that's
it
because
there's
no
more
point
to
testing
a
confession
after
a
plea
of
guilty
and
there
is
at
a
trial
the
same
issues
of
credibility
still
exist.
there's
no
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
longer
a
plea
of
guilty.
what
you're
doing
is
holding
exactly
the
same
trial
that
you
would
have
held
before
the
man
pleaded
guilty
at
a
time
when
witnesses
may
have
died,
the
evidence
of
guilt
maybe
completely
dissipated
and
the
bargain
which
he
struck
for
a
lower
charge
can
be
repudiated.
this
is
not
the
plea
of
guilty,
this
is
a
trial
and
if
we're
going
to
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
certainly
a
premise
from
which
we
operate.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
true
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
these
three
relators
who
all
pleaded
guilty
before
the
decision
of
this
court
jackson
against
denno.
now,
the
second
circuit
felt
that
it
was
compelled
by
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno
to
hold
that
new
york
did
not
provide
these
relators
with
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
test
their
claims
of
coercion.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
he
thought
they
did
it.
it's
another
issue
on
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
to
whether
that
concurrence
by
judge
kaufman
in
which
other
members
of
the
court
concurred
is
truly
the
limiting,
it's
the
limiting
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
that's
--
that's
correct
and
if
that's
true
then
the
second
circuit
decision
is
in
a
sense
more
limited
than
the
many
other
decisions
from
the
other
circuits
which
never
take
account
at
all
of
the
possibility
of
going
to
trial.
they
never
regard
it
as
a
viable
alternative
and
yet
it
seems,
it
would
seem
that
the
right
to
go
to
trial
is
really
what
is
at
issue
in
these
cases.
now,
as
i
said
briefly
before,
before
the
jackson
decision,
the
problem
in
jackson
was
at
the
same
jury
passed
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
on
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
that
procedure
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
1953
in
stein
against
new
york.
since
the
jackson
decision
applies
to
cases
which
had
already
been
tried
prior
to
june
22,
1964,
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
it
applied
also
to
cases
in
which
there
was
no
trial
prior
to
1964.
but
clearly,
jackson
does
not
apply
where
there
never
was
a
jury
trial.
the
problem
arising
from
a
case
that
had
already
been
tried
before
1964
is
that
a
confession
that
the
jury
had
already
heard
might
have
been
coerced
and
therefore
the
conviction,
that
is
the
jury's
verdict,
would've
been
based
on
the
coerced
confession.
and
so
now,
we
have
to
hold
evidentiary
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
was
the
case,
but
as
we've
said
here
the
convictions
aren't
based
on
confessions
or
any
other
evidence.
now,
the
second
circuit
also
found
that
these
relators
couldn't
be
deemed
to
had
entered
voluntary
pleas
of
guilty
if
their
pleas
were
substantially
motivated
by
coerced
confessions,
the
validity
of
which
for
practical
purposes
they
were
unable
to
contest.
but
for
this
assertion
to
have
any
meaning
it
would
have
to
be
alleged
factually
that
the
pre-jackson
procedure
in
some
way
actually
motivated
the
plea
of
guilty
and
counsel's
advice
to
plead
guilty.
in
other
words,
the
stein
procedure
as
a
matter
of
law
was
so
bad
that
it
even
prompted
pleas
of
guilty,
innocent
man
to
plead
guilty.
ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
a
guilty
plea
can
be
opened
up
to
collateral
attack
in
order
to
test
in
evidentiary
defense
which
could
have
been
tested
at
a
trial.
these
are
three
habeas
corpus
petition
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
on
the
petitions
of
state
prisoners
who
are
detained
by
virtue
of
their
pleas
of
guilty.
the
district
courts
which
initially
considered
these
habeas
petitions,
declined
to
order
such
hearing
because
the
primary
allegation
of
each
relator
that
a
coerced
confession
had
been
obtained
from
him
was
not
the
direct
attack
on
a
guilty
plea
itself.
biased
decisions
in
these
cases,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
confessions
which
weren't
introduced
against
a
relator
nevertheless
can
be
attacked
collaterally.
i
will
address
myself
primarily
to
the
nature
of
a
plea
of
guilty
as
precluding
a
subsequent
attack
on
the
admissibility
of
potential
evidence.
mr.
juviler
of
the
office
of
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
will
also
discuss
this
issue.
and
in
addition
to
claiming
that
a
coerced
confession
was
used
against
him,
each
of
these
relators
makes
other
allegations
on
which
the
second
circuit
has
also
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
and
mr.
juviler
will
discuss
those
allegations
as
well.
these
three
men
were
all
convicted
in
new
york
state
of
serious
crimes
following
their
pleas
of
guilty.
all
three
were
represented
by
counsel,
all
of
them
pleaded
guilty
to
substantially
reduced
charges.
richardson
satisfied
two
first
degree
murder
charges
by
his
plea
to
one
charge
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
after
a
plea
to
murder
on
the
first
degree
had
been
rejected
in
his
behalf.
dash
satisfied
indictment
charging
with
robbery
in
the
first
degree
by
pleading
guilty
to
robbery
in
the
second
degree
after
he
personally
rejected
a
guilty
plea
to
the
higher
charge
and
williams
satisfied
an
indictment
charging
robbery
and
rape
for
the
first
degree
with
his
guilty
plea
to
robbery
in
the
second
degree.
none
of
these
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
pleas.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
proceedings
in
the
richardson
case
are
in
the
record.
the
proceedings
in
the
dash
and
williams
cases
are
not
in
the
record
because
they
were
not
before
the
circuit
court.
there's
some
question
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
before
the
district
courts.
it
appears
to
me
from
reading
each
district
court
opinion
in
those
two
cases
that
they
did
have
those
minutes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
it's
more
than
relevant
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
second
circuit
decision
that
they
place
absolutely
no
weight
on
the
one
colloquy
which
they
did
have
before
them
which
was
a
model
of
inquiry.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
the
richardson.
it
was
most
thorough
inquiry
in
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
that's
in
the
appendix
at
pages
88
through
97.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
was
not
going
to.
i
would
like
to
follow
at
that
thought
for
a
moment
there
because
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
in
these
cases
is
that
no
matter
how
we
look
at
these
petitions
and
at
the
second
circuit
decision,
no
colloquy
even
the
one
in
richardson
could
ever
satisfy
the
issue
raised
in
these
cases.
after
the
judgments
of
conviction
became
final
in
these
cases,
each
of
these
relators
sought
collateral
relief
in
new
york
by
coram
nobis
which
is
a
post-conviction
procedure
in
new
york
for
testing
claims
which
are
not
apparent
in
the
face
of
the
record.
relief
was
denied
in
each
case
without
a
hearing
and
the
denials
were
affirmed
by
the
state
appellate
courts.
then
each
relator
sought
federal
habeas
corpus,
claiming
essentially
that
he
after
his
arrest
he
gave
a
coerced
confession.
after
the
district
courts
had
dismissed
these
petitions
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
ordered
evidentiary
hearings
in
three
separate
opinions.
the
dash
case
was
part
of
en
banc
decision,
richardson
was
decided
to
the
same
day
and
williams
about
a
month
later.
basically,
the
majority
opinion
held
in
the
second
circuit
that
where
a
claim
is
made
that
evidence
was
illegally
obtained
and
where
it
is
also
maintained
that
the
existence
and
threatened
use
of
that
evidence
at
a
trial
substantially
motivated
a
plea
of
guilty,
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
evidentiary
hearing
to
test
his
claims
--
to
test
his
claims
that
his
confession
was
coerced
that
his
plea
was
involuntary,
that
his
plea
was
substantially
motivated
by
the
allegedly
coerced
confession
that
hold
the
whole
range
of
allegations.
we
think
that
in
rendering
these
decisions,
the
court
of
appeals
has
seriously
misinterpreted
the
significance
of
a
plea
of
guilty.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
it
does.
the
hearing
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
second
circuit
contemplates
hearings
without
there
having
been
states
hearings,
that's
right
or
without
certainly
there
having
been
pre-plea
state
hearings.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
would
open
up
its
doors
to
these
petitions
if
this
case
were
affirmed
is
another
issue.
the
convictions
here
because
they
are
based
on
pleas
of
guilty,
don't
rest
on
any
evidence.
no
evidence
was
used
against
these
relators
at
a
trial
and
this
has
occurred
because
each
relator
after
consulting
with
counsel
decided
to
forgo
a
trail
and
all
the
contest
of
fact
that
that
decision
by
definition
involves.
each
instead
deliberately
choose
to
have
their
convictions
rest
solely
on
their
pleas
of
guilty
in
open
court.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
just
an
allegation.
it's
never
--
we
haven't
seen
any
confessions,
we
don't
know
if
they're
written.
i
believe
each
one
may
state
that
they're
written,
i'm
not
sure,
maybe
oral.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
the
state
can
verify
this
in
anyway.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
as
the
practical
matter
i
don't
know
how
beyond
his
own
word,
a
petitioner
would
establish
that
he
made
a
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
know
with
the
practice
is
with
respect
to
each
county
district
attorney
as
to
how
long
they
keep
files
and
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
for
example
a
policeman's
memo
book
which
may
contain
the
only
statement
which
was
ever
made
would
be
preserved
by
the
policeman
or
how
long
he
would
be
able
to
read
his
notes
or
if
they
were
ever
turned
over
to
the
district
attorney.
there's
a
whole
initial
problem
in
these
cases
as
to
ever
establishing
that
a
confession
existed,
let
alone
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
given
and
the
scope
of
their
confession
whether
it
was
in
fact
a
confession
or
a
half
admission
or
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
it
is
the
state's
problem
to
the
extent
that
we
have
to
go
to
hold
hearings
to
get
all
records,
to
get
whatever
witnesses
are
available.
it's
an
extremely
difficult
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
certainly,
he
would
have
the
burden
of
proof,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
turn
back
to
the
state
because
the
state
has
whatever
records
there
are,
if
there
are
any.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
second
circuit
has
not
answered.
they've
said
that
other
allegations
affidavits
should
be
necessary
but
they
didn't
require
it
in
any
of
these
cases
and
we're
already
getting
petitions
which
make
very
bare
assertions
on
which
hearings
have
been
ordered.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
it's
within
the
scope
of
what
the
second
circuit
has
opened
up
along
with
illegally-seized
evidence,
the
claim
that
evidence
was
illegally
seized
along
with
almost
any
evidentiary
claim
which
can
be
made.
i
have
received
a
brief
from
the
office
of
counsel
for
respondent
which
alleges
that
the
plea
was
coerced
because
of
unfair
pre-trial
publicity
and
it
rests
directly,
i
mean
that
the
allegations
are
based
directly
on
this
case
in
the
second
circuit.
so
that
its
ramifications
for
other
kinds
of
opening
up
of
the
plea
are
enormous,
i
think
they're
endless.
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
once
a
decision
has
been
made
to
rest
a
conviction
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
to
take
whatever
benefits
flow
from
that
plea
and
after
years
have
passed
and
the
state
has
relied
on
this
for
years
in
just
the
way
that
we've
describe
that
it
should
not
be
the
relator's
option
to
repudiate
the
plea
because
then
there
is
no
meaning
to
the
plea
of
guilty.
it
only
because
of
a
procedural
step
to
the
testing
of
evidentiary
claims
and
its
significance
as
an
independent
basis
of
conviction
is
completely
negated.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
ms.
brenda
soloff
without
meaning
to
be
facetious,
i
have
problems
with
the
rationale
of
the
second
circuit.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
it
can
be
read
that
if
a
confession
is
coerced
and
if
that
confession,
not
the
coercion
of
the
confession
but
the
confession
itself.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
existence
of
the
confession
substantially
motivated
to
plea
that
is
taking
into
account
whatever
other
evidence
may
have
been
available,
taking
into
account
the
nature
of
the
bargain
that
was
struck,
taking
into
account
any
variety
of
factors.
the
district
court
now
must
weigh
this
and
call
it
substantial
motivation
and
decide
how
substantial
it
was
and
if
it
was
substantial
and
apparently
if
the
confession
was
coerced
then
the
pleas
to
be
set
aside.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
that
that's
their
rationale
of
the
second
circuit.
i
think
they
ran
right
around
the
plea
of
guilty
to
the
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
believe
that
that's
really
so
with
what
--
in
second
circuit
rationale.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
what
the
second
circuit
said,
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
no,
because
i
don't
think
substantial
motivation
means
that.
i
think
all
that
substantial
motivation
means
is
there
was
a
confession,
and
for
some
reason
it
was
coerced,
but
i
didn't
test
it,
instead
because
of
that
confession
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
not
at
all.
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
held.
i
think
that
what
they
said
was
there
was
a
confession
and
it
caused
me
to
plea
guilty.
it
induced
my
plea.
i'm
sorry.
i
am
getting
confused.
it
substantially
motivates
--
the
existence
of
the
confession
substantially
motivated
my
plea.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there's
no
“but-for”
mr.
justice
brennan
has
no
“but-for”
test
announcement
on
the
second
circuit
decision,
that's
the
first
thing.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
problem
in
all
these
cases,
i
agree
that
there
is
a
difference
but
i
think
that
substantial
motivation
or
“but-for”
may
come
down
to
the
same
thing,
but
the
answer
is
still
this
plea
was
entered
in
lieu
of
a
trial.
there
could
have
been
a
trial
and
there
wasn't.
once
the
term
induced
or
substantially
motivated
and
all
of
these
terms
predicated
on
all
go
or
ignore
the
existence
of
the
trial,
they
ignore
the
very
nature
of
a
guilty
plea.
they
ignore
the
fact
that
no
evidence
is
necessary
to
support
the
conviction,
that
the
plea
is
the
independent
basis
and
that
once
you
use
words
like
“substantially
motivated”
or
“induced”
to
reach
out
the
evidentiary
test
you
had
negated
the
plea
of
guilty.
you
simply
said,
first
you
plead
guilty
and
then
we'll
have
this
evidentiary
hearing
when
you
demand
it
at
your
request.
many
years
later,
perhaps,
and
you've
undermined
the
plea
of
guilty
for
which
there
are
certainly
very
great
justification.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes.
well,
we
do
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
the
allegation
that
a
counsel
is
ineffective
is
certainly
a
ground
on
which
collateral
attack
against
a
plea
of
guilty
can
be
based.
i
would
never
not
argue
to
contrary
but
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
therefore,
i
did
not
knowingly
involuntarily
enter
a
guilty
plea
because
he
did
not
advice
me
of
the
consequences
not
because
i
had
a
coerced
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
he
comes
into
court
and
he
makes
a
long
list
of
acknowledgments
of
guilt
of
the
knowing
nature
of
the
fact.
if
he
made
a
coerced
confession,
and
counsel
didn't
attack
it,
and
he
only
attacks
counsel
on
the
ground
of
not
having
an
attack
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
that's
a
perfectly
competent
piece
of
advice
on
the
part
of
counsel.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
alleges
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
have
no
acknowledged
coerced
confessions
in
these
cases.
we
have
allegations
support.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
may
well
be
a
close
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
confession
is
or
is
not
admissible.
this
is
especially
true
where
coming
up
with
the
right
to
counsel
and
statements
as
to
whether
or
not
warnings
were
given
the
full
range
of
possibility
of
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
ms.
brenda
soloff
once
you
have
a
false
representation
by
an
officer
of
the
state,
you
have
a
collateral
issue.
in
fact,
we
cite
a
case
in
our
brief
in
which
new
york
has
held
that
where
an
officer
testified
falsely
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
but
where
we
have
a
claim
of
coercion
and
an
available
procedure
and
this
is
essentially
what
we're
talking
about
in
these
cases,
then
we
have
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
except
for
where
you
have
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right,
that's
what
the
plea
of
guilty
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
difference
being
that
once
you
go
to
trail
and
test
a
confession,
the
confession
becomes
a
part
of
the
basis
of
the
judgment
of
conviction.
it
is
evidence
which
probably
led
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
you're
entitled
in
those
circumstances
to
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
confession
was
coerced.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
that's
it
because
there's
no
more
point
to
testing
a
confession
after
a
plea
of
guilty
and
there
is
at
a
trial
the
same
issues
of
credibility
still
exist.
there's
no
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it's
not
longer
a
plea
of
guilty.
what
you're
doing
is
holding
exactly
the
same
trial
that
you
would
have
held
before
the
man
pleaded
guilty
at
a
time
when
witnesses
may
have
died,
the
evidence
of
guilt
maybe
completely
dissipated
and
the
bargain
which
he
struck
for
a
lower
charge
can
be
repudiated.
this
is
not
the
plea
of
guilty,
this
is
a
trial
and
if
we're
going
to
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
certainly
a
premise
from
which
we
operate.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
true
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
these
three
relators
who
all
pleaded
guilty
before
the
decision
of
this
court
jackson
against
denno.
now,
the
second
circuit
felt
that
it
was
compelled
by
the
decision
in
jackson
against
denno
to
hold
that
new
york
did
not
provide
these
relators
with
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
test
their
claims
of
coercion.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that's
right.
he
thought
they
did
it.
it's
another
issue
on
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
to
whether
that
concurrence
by
judge
kaufman
in
which
other
members
of
the
court
concurred
is
truly
the
limiting,
it's
the
limiting
point.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
that's
--
that's
correct
and
if
that's
true
then
the
second
circuit
decision
is
in
a
sense
more
limited
than
the
many
other
decisions
from
the
other
circuits
which
never
take
account
at
all
of
the
possibility
of
going
to
trial.
they
never
regard
it
as
a
viable
alternative
and
yet
it
seems,
it
would
seem
that
the
right
to
go
to
trial
is
really
what
is
at
issue
in
these
cases.
now,
as
i
said
briefly
before,
before
the
jackson
decision,
the
problem
in
jackson
was
at
the
same
jury
passed
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
on
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
that
procedure
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
1953
in
stein
against
new
york.
since
the
jackson
decision
applies
to
cases
which
had
already
been
tried
prior
to
june
22,
1964,
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
it
applied
also
to
cases
in
which
there
was
no
trial
prior
to
1964.
but
clearly,
jackson
does
not
apply
where
there
never
was
a
jury
trial.
the
problem
arising
from
a
case
that
had
already
been
tried
before
1964
is
that
a
confession
that
the
jury
had
already
heard
might
have
been
coerced
and
therefore
the
conviction,
that
is
the
jury's
verdict,
would've
been
based
on
the
coerced
confession.
and
so
now,
we
have
to
hold
evidentiary
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
was
the
case,
but
as
we've
said
here
the
convictions
aren't
based
on
confessions
or
any
other
evidence.
now,
the
second
circuit
also
found
that
these
relators
couldn't
be
deemed
to
had
entered
voluntary
pleas
of
guilty
if
their
pleas
were
substantially
motivated
by
coerced
confessions,
the
validity
of
which
for
practical
purposes
they
were
unable
to
contest.
but
for
this
assertion
to
have
any
meaning
it
would
have
to
be
alleged
factually
that
the
pre-jackson
procedure
in
some
way
actually
motivated
the
plea
of
guilty
and
counsel's
advice
to
plead
guilty.
in
other
words,
the
stein
procedure
as
a
matter
of
law
was
so
bad
that
it
even
prompted
pleas
of
guilty,
innocent
man
to
plead
guilty.
