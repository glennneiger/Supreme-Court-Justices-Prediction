against
richardson.
ms.
soloff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
question
to
test
the
scope
of
what
the
second
circuit
opinion
really
is
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
suppose
an
allegation
were
made
in
these
same
circumstances
in
terms
of
time
on
criminal
acts
and
the
petitioner
alleged
that
he
had
been
motivated
in
making
his
guilty
plea
by
the
knowledge
that
an
eyewitness
was
available,
but
that
this
eyewitness
was
one
who's
testimony
was
“tainted”
because
of
improper
line
ups
or
exhibition
of
the
photographs
etc.
would
you
read
its
being
within
the
scope
of
what
the
second
circuit
has
now
opened
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
but
wasn't
there
a
gap
between
“but-for”
test
and
a
motivation
test,
influence
test,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
is
a
vehicle
i
think
you
suggested
this
or
intimated,
there
is
a
vehicle
that
if
they
want
to
test
that
out
at
that
time
while
it's
fresh,
move
to
suppress
any
existing
confession
and
test
it
out
there
and
if
they
have
not
so
moved,
is
it
your
suggestion
they
permanently
waived
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
recess
now
for
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
time
limit
on
that
in
new
york?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
can't
do
this
by
collateral
attack
15
years
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
means
relationship,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
juviler.
mrs.
oberman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
bring
this
to
something
that
i've
been
wanting
to
inquire
about
by
me.
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
is
the
primary
motivation,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
hear
what
other
evidence
the
state
to
have,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
we
come
to
this
hearing
which
maybe
three
years,
nine
years,
twelve
years
after
the
trial
and
the
state
then
is
required
to
show
that
it
had
five
eyewitnesses
and
if
they
can
bring
these
five
eyewitnesses
then
i
suppose
reasonably
the
district
judge
might
find
that
the
coerced
confession,
the
allegedly
coerced
confession,
was
not
the
primary
motivation,
is
that
a
reasonably
fair
conclusion
to
draw
for
the
moment?
now
then,
suppose
the
state
says
yes,
we
have
five
eyewitnesses
at
the
time
and
one
of
them
moved
to
hawaii
and
we
can't
get
the
testimony,
two
of
them
died
and
one
was
in
vietnam,
now
what
kind
of
a
predicament
does
that
put
the
state
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
isn't
going
to
take
the
risk
of
just
letting
him
hear
all
his
evidence
unless
it
so
utterly
spurious
on
its
face
that
they
are
willing
to
take
that
risk.
the
state
is
going
to
really
have
to
prove
its
case
to
show
how
the
total
evidence
balances
with
the
coerced
--
with
the
confession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
suffered
would
be
rather
a
better
word
for
us,
suffered
with
this
problem.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
12
years
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we're
dealing
now
with
the
cases
where
they
had
lawyers,
they
did
have
lawyers
at
the
time
these
pleas
were
entered.
no
problem
with
these
people
being
in
any
different
position
because
of
their
indigency
than
any
other
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
do
you
get
at
that
without
the
subjective
test,
mrs.
oberman?
as
justice
stewart
suggested,
who
can
say
what
his
motivation
was
except
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
this
standard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
it
sometimes
have
something
to
do
with
what
happened
before
he
was
arrested?
i
can't
quite
follow
your
statement
that
it
flows
from
what
happened
between
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
the
time
he
comes
to
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
you
have
--
suppose
you
have,
this
may
seem
a
very
elementary
question,
but
it
maybe
needed
to
clear
it
up.
suppose
that
a
man
robs
the
supermarket
and
there
are
29
people
seen
him
and
all
29
are
ready
to
come
in
the
court,
his
lawyer
interviews
all
these
witnesses
whose
names
are
given
to
him
by
prosecutor
and
they
all
say,
yes
this
is
the
man
and
i
can
identify
him.
so
his
advice
to
the
man
is
you
better
plead
guilty.
now,
he
is
coerced,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
facts
he
is
compelled
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
better
take
the
best
plea
he
can
get,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference
between
the
free
choice
in
the
one
case
than
the
other
if
you
will?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
when
a
close
question,
a
choice
is
made,
why
is
not
that
the
end
of
it?
you
just
posed
a
hypothetically
close
case
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
admissible.
why
isn't
the
choice
then
final,
instead
of
having
to
have
a
district
judge
review
it
eight,
ten
or
12
years
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
instead
of
just
asking
the
question
as
was
put
here,
did
you
commit
the
crime
and
getting
an
affirmative
answer,
suppose
the
trial
judge
taking
the
plea
said,
now
tell
me
what
you
did
and
the
defendant
then
related
in
great
detail
all
of
the
circumstances,
how
to
crime
was
planned
and
executed,
would
you
say
--
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
with
reference
to
the
possibility
of
an
alleged
coerced
confession
that
you
now
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
then
the
issue
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence,
but
only
with
what
led
the
man
to
decide
to
make
the
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
now
speaking
though
in
the
context
of
case
towards
being
tried
and
the
question
of
the
use
of
the
confession
is
involved,
isn't
that
quite
different
when
you
come
to
a
plea
of
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
value
to
come
in
to
play
when
the
man
has
stood
before
the
judge
in
open
courtroom,
and
spent
15
minutes
describing
in
detail
how
he
committed
the
crime
when
there
can
be
no
possibility
that
a
policeman
or
anyone
else
is
going
to
beat
him
with
the
club
in
the
presence
of
a
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mrs.

chief

e.

i

your
time
