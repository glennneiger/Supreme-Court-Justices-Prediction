justice

he
should
have
taken
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
receivables
plus
--
and
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
reserve,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
partnership
probably
has
to
report
as
an
entity,
it
isn’t
a
taxable
entity
basically?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
group
of
individuals?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
the,
under
your
theory
your
client's
partners
should
not
have
added
back
into
their
income
the
amount
there
before
set
up
as
a
reserve
for
bad
debt
and
what
would
be
the
result
vis-à-vis
the
newly
created
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
in
amount,
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say,
don’t
take
it
into
the
income
of
the
partnership
and
don't
give
the
corporation
a
deduction
on
its
first
year?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
also
the
basis
of
the
stock
received
by
the
partners
in
return
for
the
transfer
of
the
partnership
assets
would
be
reduced,
it
would
be
a
net,
it
would
be
the
amount
of
assets
represented
by
the
accounts
receivable
less
the
reserve
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
will
be
a
net
figure.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
so
the
basis
in
the
hands
--
of
the
stock
in
the
hands
of
the
partners
would
be
lowered,
therefore
on
any
subsequent
sale
or
taxable
transfer,
their
capital
gain
would
be
higher,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
would
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
because
on
this
year,
they
haven’t
paid
anything
for
that
$73,000.00
worth
of
accounts
receivable.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
had
understood
your
argument,
mr.
zinn,
it
was
this
that
the
statute
itself
does
not
explicitly
tell
you
or
the
taxpayer
how
this
situation
should
be
handled
and
that
your
submission
is
that
the
way
you
handle
it
is
a
reasonable
way
of
handling
it
under
the
statute
and
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
case
and
as
i
further
understand
it,
neither
you
on
the
one
hand,
nor
your
adversary
on
the
other
are
claiming
that
either,
there
should
be
double
taxation
or
a
double
deduction.
you
both
recognize
that
however
this
is
worked
out,
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
double
deduction
and
that
these
same
items
should
not
be
taxed
twice.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
understand
it
further,
you’re
not
saying
that
the
way
you
decided
to
handle
this
is
the
only
proper
way
of
doing
it.
you're
just
simply
saying
it’s
a
reasonable
way
of
doing
it
and
that
under
the
decisions,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
case.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
best
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
neither
side
in
this
case
is,
your
adversary
is
not
claiming
it
is
going
to
be
taxed
twice
and
you're
not
claiming
that
it's
going
to
be
deducted
twice.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
just
which
accounting
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
should
have
taken
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
receivables
plus
--
and
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
reserve,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
partnership
probably
has
to
report

it

justice
potter

and
you
say,
don’t
take
it
into
the
income
of
the
partnership
and
don't
give
the
corporation
a
deduction
on
its
first

justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
also
the
basis
of
the
stock
received
by
the

in

the

of

assets

it

justice

and
that
--
so
the

of
the
