what
goodness
has
this
partnership
engaged
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
lending
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
challenge
to
the
question
as
to
the
amount
they
have
tried
to
set
aside
for
bad
debt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
that
change
the
situation
with
reference
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
that?
at
subsequently
event?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
changed
their
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
form
from
a
partnership
to
a
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
based
on
the
fact,
somehow
somebody
didn't
put
down
there
what
they
had
intended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
government
is
going
to
get
this
payment
although
it
shouldn't
have
it
but
nevertheless
the
letter
of
the
law
doesn’t
allow
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
your
position
that
in
all
truth
and
fact
and
justice
that
this
is
not
going
to
require
a
taxpayer
to
pay
taxes
on
income
that
he
did
not
receive
as
income?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
admit
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
will
have
to
pay
income
tax
on
income
that
he
did
not
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
saying
that
this
would
be
a
double
benefit
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
happens
suppose
they
don't
collect
it?
the
sale
turned
out
to
be
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
take
it.
it
would
be
entitled
to
take
a
deduction
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument
as
to
why
it's
fair
for
the
government
to
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
in
fact
is
it
that
the
government
would
get
this
i
mean
the
taxpayer
would
be
getting
this
reduction
twice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
you
say
it’s
already
gotten.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
claim
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
government
--
for
taxpayer
be
denied
this
deduction
twice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
do
you
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
them
to
get
it
twice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
just
once
is
all
the
deduction
they
should
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
no
scheme
will
do
that
whether
you
call
it
reasonable,
you
wouldn’t
call
it
reasonable
if
it
didn’t
accomplish
that,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
call
it
reasonable
would
you
if
it
was
making
this
taxpayer
be
denied
of
privilege
over
a
deduction
for
a
loss
he
had
had.
