mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
the
balance
in
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
maintained
by
a
partnership
and
stipulated
by
the
parties
to
be
reasonable
must
be
taken
into
ordinary
income
or
not
by
the
partnership
when
it
incorporates
its
business
under
section
351
of
the
internal
review
code.
section
351
providing
that
no
gain
or
loss
will
be
recognized
if
property
is
transferred
to
a
controlled
corporation
and
it’s
agreed
by
the
parties
that
the
transfers'
the
incorporations
here
are
within
the
purview
of
section
351.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
the
partnership
had
liquidated
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
no,
your
honor,
under
the
partnership
concept,
liquidating
to
the
various
partners,
each
would
have
taken
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
receivable
with
the
reserve
and
it
would
not
have
come
into
the
income
of
the
partners.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
no
sir.
because
you
have
come
straight
through.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that’s
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right
and
in
this
situation,
this
partnership
operated
10
finance
businesses,
two
in
south
carolina
and
eight
in
alabama.
it
made
loans
to
the
public
and
it
used
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
under
which
it
would
take
into
its
ordinary
income
the
profit
on
a
loan,
the
receivable
in
the
year
in
which
the
loan
was
made
and
the
receivable
established.
it
accounted
for
its
bad
debts
by
the
use
of
the
reserve
method
for
the
bad
debts
allowed
under
section
166
of
the
code.
actually,
a
taxpayer
can
use
either
of
two
methods.
it
can
use
the
direct
charge-off
method
which
allows
you
to
charge
against
income
in
the
year
that
the
account
goes
bad
or
a
taxpayer
can
anticipate
its
losses
as
far
as
specific
accounts
are
concerned
and
establish
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
and
based
on
its
experience,
estimate
the
amount
of
the
accounts
receivable
which
will
go
bad
and
charge
that
amount
against
income
when
it
establishes
its
reserve.
the
reserve
is
reviewed
annually
and
any
additions
to
the
reserve
are
likewise
charged
against
income
as
a
deduction
and
they're
limited
of
course
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
reserve
which
in
our
situation
is
stipulated.
on
may
31,
1960,
the
partnership
had
about
approximately
$487,000.00
worth
of
receivables
in
these
eight
alabama
offices
and
approximately
a
$73,000.00
balance
in
its
reserve
for
bad
debts
applicable
to
those
eight
offices.
it
then
on
june
1
transferred
to
eight
separate
corporations
for
it
attained
a
benefit
under
the
alabama
loan
licensing
statutes
by
have
eight
separate
corporate
offices
that
could
lend
money
and
it
transferred
to
those
eight
offices
the
receivables
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations.
the
furniture
and
fixtures
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations,
cash
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations
and
liabilities
taking
back
stock
and
security
solely
for
the
net
value
transferred
to
the
partnership
to
the
corporations.
it
continued
the
same
businesses
in
the
eight
corporations
and
what
it
did,
the
corporations
then
set
up
the
reserve,
they
had
an
opening
balance
which
they
reflected
in
their
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
total
and
we’re
dealing
here
in
both
briefs
with
the
total
concept.
the
total
amount
of
the
reserves
reflected
in
the
opening
balance
sheets
of
these
eight
corporations
was
$73,000.00.
in
1962,
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
issued
his
revenue
ruling
62-128
where
he
first
expressed
the
position
that
the
reserve
for
which
being
maintained
by
a
partnership
would
be
taken
back
into
the
ordinary
income
of
the
partnership
when
it
transfers
its
assets
even
though
such
transfer
being
under
the
tax
free
rules
generally
of
section
351
and
thereafter,
the
commissioner's
agent
examined
the
returns
of
the
partnership
which
made
a
determination
that
the
$73,000.00
of
reserve
should
be
restored
to
the
ordinary
income
of
the
partnership
in
its
year
which
ended
in
1961.
this
increased
the
distributive
share
of
income
to
the
partners
and
therefore
the
partner’s
income
increased
in
1961.
they
paid
their
tax,
filed
a
claim
for
refund
and
filed
suit
in
district
court,
the
district
court
upholding
the
taxpayer's
position
that
the
reserve
would
not
be
restored
to
income
relying
on
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
of
the
estate
of
heinz
schmidt.
the
government’s
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
fifth
circuit
said
they
disagreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
agreed
with
the
tax
court
and
sustained
the
commissioner's
position
and
hence
this
writ
of
certiorari.
we
maintain
that
the
clear
legislative
history
of
section
351
precludes
this
end
rule,
this
creation
of
income
to
the
partnership
when
it
incorporates
its
business
under
that
section.
it
came
into
the
law.
section
351
came
into
the
law
in
1921
at
the
same
time
congress
first
enacted
the
reorganization
provisions
and
also
enacted
the
tax
free
exchanges
of
real
estate
provisions.
and
the
senate's
finance
committee
in
its
report
in
1921
said
that
they
had
been
--
they
recounted
that
the
prior
law,
under
the
prior
law
before
1921,
this
would
have
been
a
taxable
event,
a
reorganization
or
the
organization
of
a
corporation
as
we
have
here
would
be
in
a
taxable
event
before
1921
and
they
said
there
had
been
no
provision
which
had
more
seriously
interfered
with
necessary
business
readjustments
than
these
prior
laws
and
therefore
they
put
in
these
tax
free
exchange
provisions.
they
said
they
specifically
sought
to
eliminate
technical
constructions
which
are
economically
unsound
and
interfered
with
necessary
business
readjustments.
in
1924,
congress
considered
the
carryover
basis
sections
of
the
code
which
are
the
corollary
to
tax-free
exchanges,
the
corporation
taking
a
carryover
basis
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
express
their
views
again,
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
predecessor
of
section
351
of
the
code
where
they
said
that
this
section
351
and
the
reorganization
sections
were
not
intended
to
be
exemptions
from
taxation.
that
they
were
recognitions
that
these
changes
were
merely
changes
in
form
and
not
in
substance
and
would
not
be
given
to
recognition
of
income,
that
any
recognition
of
income
would
be
postponed
until
there
was
an
actual
sale
or
a
taxable
exchange.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
we
would
say
the
result
is
what
did
happen
in
our
situation.
the
corporation
set
up
a
reserve
for
bad
debts.
it
had
a
balance
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
identical.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
it's
open.
in
amount.
it's
had
$73,000.00
in
it.
now,
that
amount
was
not
charged
against
corporate
income
for
the
first
year
as
a
reduction
of
income
which
is
the
government’s
position.
the
government
says
take
it
into
the
income
of
the
partnership
and
give
the
corporation
a
new
deduction
in
its
first
year
for
$73,000.00.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that’s
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
the
net
figure.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
for
that
$73,000.00.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
or
any
other
year.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
that
it
was
just
a
mere
change
in
form.
the
government
in
their
brief
cast
this
poll
of
an
expected
double
deduction
that
the
code
is
to
be
construed
to
prevent
double
deductions.
we
took
no
double
deduction.
we
set
it
up
on
the
corporate
books
without
deducting
against
corporate
income.
our
taxpayer
considers
his
stock
to
be
worth
net.
the
section’s
both
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
came
into
the
section
coincidentally
in
1921.
the
same
year
that
the
predecessor
of
our
tax-free
organization
section
351
came
in,
we
have
found
no
case,
nor
has
the
government
cited
any
case
since
1921
where
any
corporation
has
so
a
second
deduction
or
any
taxpayer
has
tried
to
take
a
second
deduction.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
they
pay
the
partner's
cash
in
the
face
amount?
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
they
would
take
--
well,
that’s
a
difficult
question
to
immediately
answer
for
this
reason,
they
would
say
that
if
you
had
a
non
--
if
you
had
a
taxable
sale
of
the
receivables
at
net,
face
amount
less
the
reserve
that
under
--
that
there
is
no
income
because
they
seek
to
offset
a
return
of
the
reserve
to
income
by
a
loss
on
the
receivables.
now
if
you
had,
they
say
however
in
our
situation,
this
is
a
tax-free
exchange
which
precludes
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
therefore
there
is
no
loss
that
can
be
recognized
to
the
transferring
partners
to
offset
the
return
of
the
reserve
to
income
so
that
their
position
in
a
taxable
exchange
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
income
but
if
we
had
a
transfer
of
the
receivables
in
exchange
for
cash
in
a
nontaxable
environment,
then
their
answer
would
probably
be
the
same.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
their
result
would
not
be
any
different.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
had
the
corporation
instead
of
turning
up
a
reserve
simply
established
on
its
books
receivables
at
the
net
amount
of
$414,000.00,
the
net
amount,
their
answer
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
they
still
think
we
realized
income.
now,
they
cite
which
i
think
is
a
good
case
and
i
wish
i
had
cited
it,
the
skelly
oil
opinion
where
they
say
that
the
court
will
not
permit
any
double
deduction
and
i
believe
that
with
that
decision,
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
if
a
corporation
tried
to
come
into
court
later
on,
or
a
taxpayer
tried
to
come
into
court
to
get
a
second
deduction
that
that
would
ever
be
allowed.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
this
is
what
would
happen,
mr.
justice
burger.
the
corporation
would
then
have
recovered
the
full
amount
of
its
receivables.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
would
go
into
income
by
the
corporation.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
and
if
that
happened
quite
soon
after
the
incorporation,
i
think
the
commissioner
would
come
in
and
say
the
reserve
wasn't
reasonable
in
amount
and
would
probably
seek
to
have
the
partnership
pay
some
income
tax
on
it
because
if
the
reserve
is
not
reasonable,
he’s
got
other
rules
that
they
would
apply
and
we
would
not
argue
with
it
but
in
our
situation,
it
stipulated
that
the
reserve
is
reasonable.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
we
would
realize
income.
we
would
say
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
we
would
say
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
which
the
government
espouses
in
their
brief
correctly
but
doesn’t
apply,
would
apply.
the
tax
benefit
rule
which
they
say
is
the
basis
for
the
revenue
ruling
62-128
says
that
if
you
take
a
deduction
in
a
prior
year,
it
is
of
tax
benefit
in
the
prior
year
and
you
subsequently
recovered
the
deduction,
then
you
have
to
take
into
income
the
amount
of
the
recovery
in
the
year
of
the
recovery.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
you
collect
those
accounts
in,
then
you
do
have
--
in
other
words,
you
have
a
recovery
of
the
reserve.
we
say
in
this
nontaxable
situation
was
a
mere
change
in
form
that
there
is
--
and
this
was
the
philosophy
i
think
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
ignored
section
--
well,
they
mentioned
it
but
they
did
not
give
a
lot
of
weight
to
section
351.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
either
but
they
grounded
their
opinion
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
recovery,
that
the
philosophy
of
the
government
in
using
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
take
--
to
recover
the
bad
debt
in
some
future
point
should
be
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
recovery
at
some
later
year
of
the
amount
of
the
reserve
and
that
when
you
get
back
stock
certificates
representing
the
net
value
of
the
assets
transferred,
the
accounts
receivable
less
the
value,
that
there
was
no
recovery.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
well,
you
would
pay
a
--
you
would
not
have
an
immediate
recognition
at
the
beginning
where
you
could
have
a
higher
rate
or
you
could
have
a
lower
rate
i
imagine.
at
that
time
--
either
way
at
that
time,
the
corporation
takes
it
back
into
its
income
depending
on
the
two
rate
structures.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
you
see
what
would
happen,
we
would
take
it
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
i
don't
--
we
really
not
put
it
to
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
we
had
to
take
--
if
the
partners
took
the
$73,000.00
worth
of
receivables
into
income,
then
they
would
--
they
say
in
their
brief
that
the
corporation
would
then
be
entitled
to
set
up
a
$73,000.00
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
its
first
year.
now
if
the
corporation
chose
to
do
that
and
take
a
deduction
of
$73,000.00
in
its
first
year
and
later
recovered
the
$73,000.00
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
it’s
been
paid
but
you
could
have
--
if
you
had
a
second
deduction
under
their
theory
you
could
have
a
second
tax
to
pay
on
it.
we
say
that
would
just
really
distort
the
income
of
the
new
corporation
giving
it
a
whopping
big
deduction
in
the
first
year
when
it
has
no
earnings
necessarily,
it's
not
related
to
any
business
activity
and
creates
an
income
item
to
the
partnership.
i
see
that
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
statement
of
mr.
zinn
points
up
the
problem
they
have
in
applying
the
tax
benefit
rule
realistically.
they
set
forth
the
rule
but
they
don’t
apply
certainly
in
the
taxable
exchange
area
when
there's
a
cash
sale
of
accounts
receivable.
the
rule
as
set
forth
in
their
brief
says
you
restore
to
income
a
deduction
when
you
recover
it.
well,
if
you
have
a
sale
for
the
receivables
at
gross,
that’s
a
recovery
and
it
would
come
in
income.
if
you
have
a
sale
at
net,
the
most
logical
conclusion
seems
to
me
is
that
you
have
no
recovery
under
the
tax
benefit
rule
and
therefore
there’s
no
income
to
the
taxpayer
selling
in
a
taxable
transaction.
the
government
in
order
to
bend
the
rule
to
fit
our
tax
free
situation
sets
up
a
hypothesis
that
they
have
a
loss
realized
on
the
receivables
which
counteracts
the
return
to
income
of
the
reserve
and
the
wash
result
is
a
net
of
zero.
we
say
that's
an
incorrect
approach
to
the
problem.
the
loss
occurred
when
the
taxpayer
got
the
deduction
for
the
reserve.
when
you
set
it
up,
that's
when
the
deduction
occurred.
the
fact
that
later
on,
he
sold
it
net
was
merely
a
realization
that
his
estimate,
his
loss
was
correct,
not
a
subsequent
loss
down
the
road
to
offset
some
artificial
inclusion
in
income.
we
further
say
that
we
do
not
agree
in
our
brief
and
our
brief,
i
think
shows
that,
that
there
is
a
different
rule
to
apply
in
section
337
liquidations.
we
don't
--
i
did
not
cover
that
because
it’s
covered
in
my
brief
but
mr.
zinn
said
that
we
did
agree
and
we
do
not.
in
fact,
the
revenue
ruling
in
1957
where
the
government
covered
the
liquidation
under
a
one
year
liquidation
rule
specifically
set
up
the
hypothesis
that
the
corporation
sold
its
receivables
at
face.
and
they
said,
therefore
the
reserve
comes
back
into
income.
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
tax
benefit
rule
in
its
proper
application
and
i've
set
out
that
entire
revenue
ruling
in
the
last
page
of
my
appendix.
i
also
take
issue
with
mr.
zinn
when
he
disputes
whether
upon
the
liquidation
of
a
partnership
the
reserve
comes
into
income
of
the
partners.
in
my
judgment,
in
a
pro
rata
liquidation
of
a
partnership
under
section
736,
there
is
no
recognition
of
income
to
the
partners.
i
would
just
focus
our
attention
if
i
will
on
the
question,
the
government
has
assumed
as
we
said
that
there
is
a
problem
of
a
double
deduction.
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
problem
of
a
double
deduction
because
there
has
been
no,
in
our
case,
no
one
has
tried
to
take
a
second
deduction
and
in
no
case
discussed
today
or
in
any
of
the
brief
has
any
taxpayer
attempted
to
take
a
second
deduction
at
any
stage.
so
that
the
basis
hypothesis
for
the
need
for
the
revenue
ruling
it
seems
to
me
unfounded
that
there
is
not
second
deduction
to
guard
against
and
therefore,
without
that
problem,
there’s
no
need
to
even
travel
under
7805
but
under
that
section,
the
solution
if
we
were
to
assume
for
argument
there’s
a
problem.
under
that
section,
the
solution
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
statute.
we
say
that
section
351
which
says
no
gain
or
loss
if
property
is
transferred,
if,
it
doesn’t
say
from
property,
it’s
not
tied
to
the
property.
it
says
if
property
is
transferred,
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
points
out
that
that’s
not
a
taxable
event,
it’s
just
a
change
of
form
and
in
1924,
congress
in
reviewing
it
said,
no
gain
or
loss
and
in
the
next
sentence,
it
says,
this
is
not
a
time
for
the
realization
of
income.
so
we
say
there
is
no
magic
in
saying
what
we
have
over
here
is
income
and
the
statute
said
no
gain,
loss
or
income
because
in
1924,
they
used
the
two
terms
interchangeably.
certainly,
the
cure
to
the
illness
should
not
be
worse
than
the
illness
itself
and
that’s
what’s
going
to
happen
if
we
restore
to
the
partnership
this
income.
it
creates
artificial
tax
planning.
partners,
proprietors,
transfer
into
corporations
can't
put
receivables
into
their
corporations
because
if
that
mature
the
reserve
for
bad
debts,
they
would
not
then
have
any
cash
to
pay
the
income
tax
with.
so
what's
happened
since
1962
is
that
people
with
reserve
for
bad
debts
have
been
artificially
holding
out
their
receivables,
or
else
possibly
making
cash
sales
at
nets
to
third
parties
to
create
what
the
government
says
is
a
wash
situation.
that
--
and
this
is
a
recurring
problem.
the
government
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
agrees
that
we
have
incorporations
of
businesses
everyday
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
we
should
not
visit
the
need
for
some
artificial
planning.
congress
in
1921
said,
to
order,
to
encourage
business
readjustments
and
even
spoke
of
artificial
transactions
that
they
were
going
to
place
this
tax
free
environment.
the
simplest
thing
i
think
is
not
to
look
to
a
specific
solution
to
a
double
deduction,
we
say
there
isn’t
or
to
simply
for
the
court
to
remind
the
tax
bar
is
we
don’t
need
reminding
of
your
decision
of
skelly
oil.
there
is
just
not
going
to
be
any
second
deduction
allowed
irrespective
of
which
particular
route
is
followed
and
we
urge
that
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed
and
that
the
district
court's
decision
be
affirmed
so
that
the
partnership
in
this
situation
would
not
take
into
its
income
the
reserve
for
bad
debts.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
the
balance
in
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
maintained
by
a
partnership
and
stipulated
by
the
parties
to
be
reasonable
must
be
taken
into
ordinary
income
or
not
by
the
partnership
when
it
incorporates
its
business
under
section
351
of
the
internal
review
code.
section
351
providing
that
no
gain
or
loss
will
be
recognized
if
property
is
transferred
to
a
controlled
corporation
and
it’s
agreed
by
the
parties
that
the
transfers'
the
incorporations
here
are
within
the
purview
of
section
351.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
the
partnership
had
liquidated
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
no,
your
honor,
under
the
partnership
concept,
liquidating
to
the
various
partners,
each
would
have
taken
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
receivable
with
the
reserve
and
it
would
not
have
come
into
the
income
of
the
partners.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
no
sir.
because
you
have
come
straight
through.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that’s
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right
and
in
this
situation,
this
partnership
operated
10
finance
businesses,
two
in
south
carolina
and
eight
in
alabama.
it
made
loans
to
the
public
and
it
used
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
under
which
it
would
take
into
its
ordinary
income
the
profit
on
a
loan,
the
receivable
in
the
year
in
which
the
loan
was
made
and
the
receivable
established.
it
accounted
for
its
bad
debts
by
the
use
of
the
reserve
method
for
the
bad
debts
allowed
under
section
166
of
the
code.
actually,
a
taxpayer
can
use
either
of
two
methods.
it
can
use
the
direct
charge-off
method
which
allows
you
to
charge
against
income
in
the
year
that
the
account
goes
bad
or
a
taxpayer
can
anticipate
its
losses
as
far
as
specific
accounts
are
concerned
and
establish
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
and
based
on
its
experience,
estimate
the
amount
of
the
accounts
receivable
which
will
go
bad
and
charge
that
amount
against
income
when
it
establishes
its
reserve.
the
reserve
is
reviewed
annually
and
any
additions
to
the
reserve
are
likewise
charged
against
income
as
a
deduction
and
they're
limited
of
course
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
reserve
which
in
our
situation
is
stipulated.
on
may
31,
1960,
the
partnership
had
about
approximately
$487,000.00
worth
of
receivables
in
these
eight
alabama
offices
and
approximately
a
$73,000.00
balance
in
its
reserve
for
bad
debts
applicable
to
those
eight
offices.
it
then
on
june
1
transferred
to
eight
separate
corporations
for
it
attained
a
benefit
under
the
alabama
loan
licensing
statutes
by
have
eight
separate
corporate
offices
that
could
lend
money
and
it
transferred
to
those
eight
offices
the
receivables
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations.
the
furniture
and
fixtures
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations,
cash
applicable
to
the
eight
corporations
and
liabilities
taking
back
stock
and
security
solely
for
the
net
value
transferred
to
the
partnership
to
the
corporations.
it
continued
the
same
businesses
in
the
eight
corporations
and
what
it
did,
the
corporations
then
set
up
the
reserve,
they
had
an
opening
balance
which
they
reflected
in
their
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
total
and
we’re
dealing
here
in
both
briefs
with
the
total
concept.
the
total
amount
of
the
reserves
reflected
in
the
opening
balance
sheets
of
these
eight
corporations
was
$73,000.00.
in
1962,
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
issued
his
revenue
ruling
62-128
where
he
first
expressed
the
position
that
the
reserve
for
which
being
maintained
by
a
partnership
would
be
taken
back
into
the
ordinary
income
of
the
partnership
when
it
transfers
its
assets
even
though
such
transfer
being
under
the
tax
free
rules
generally
of
section
351
and
thereafter,
the
commissioner's
agent
examined
the
returns
of
the
partnership
which
made
a
determination
that
the
$73,000.00
of
reserve
should
be
restored
to
the
ordinary
income
of
the
partnership
in
its
year
which
ended
in
1961.
this
increased
the
distributive
share
of
income
to
the
partners
and
therefore
the
partner’s
income
increased
in
1961.
they
paid
their
tax,
filed
a
claim
for
refund
and
filed
suit
in
district
court,
the
district
court
upholding
the
taxpayer's
position
that
the
reserve
would
not
be
restored
to
income
relying
on
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
of
the
estate
of
heinz
schmidt.
the
government’s
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
fifth
circuit
said
they
disagreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
agreed
with
the
tax
court
and
sustained
the
commissioner's
position
and
hence
this
writ
of
certiorari.
we
maintain
that
the
clear
legislative
history
of
section
351
precludes
this
end
rule,
this
creation
of
income
to
the
partnership
when
it
incorporates
its
business
under
that
section.
it
came
into
the
law.
section
351
came
into
the
law
in
1921
at
the
same
time
congress
first
enacted
the
reorganization
provisions
and
also
enacted
the
tax
free
exchanges
of
real
estate
provisions.
and
the
senate's
finance
committee
in
its
report
in
1921
said
that
they
had
been
--
they
recounted
that
the
prior
law,
under
the
prior
law
before
1921,
this
would
have
been
a
taxable
event,
a
reorganization
or
the
organization
of
a
corporation
as
we
have
here
would
be
in
a
taxable
event
before
1921
and
they
said
there
had
been
no
provision
which
had
more
seriously
interfered
with
necessary
business
readjustments
than
these
prior
laws
and
therefore
they
put
in
these
tax
free
exchange
provisions.
they
said
they
specifically
sought
to
eliminate
technical
constructions
which
are
economically
unsound
and
interfered
with
necessary
business
readjustments.
in
1924,
congress
considered
the
carryover
basis
sections
of
the
code
which
are
the
corollary
to
tax-free
exchanges,
the
corporation
taking
a
carryover
basis
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
express
their
views
again,
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
predecessor
of
section
351
of
the
code
where
they
said
that
this
section
351
and
the
reorganization
sections
were
not
intended
to
be
exemptions
from
taxation.
that
they
were
recognitions
that
these
changes
were
merely
changes
in
form
and
not
in
substance
and
would
not
be
given
to
recognition
of
income,
that
any
recognition
of
income
would
be
postponed
until
there
was
an
actual
sale
or
a
taxable
exchange.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
we
would
say
the
result
is
what
did
happen
in
our
situation.
the
corporation
set
up
a
reserve
for
bad
debts.
it
had
a
balance
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
identical.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
it's
open.
in
amount.
it's
had
$73,000.00
in
it.
now,
that
amount
was
not
charged
against
corporate
income
for
the
first
year
as
a
reduction
of
income
which
is
the
government’s
position.
the
government
says
take
it
into
the
income
of
the
partnership
and
give
the
corporation
a
new
deduction
in
its
first
year
for
$73,000.00.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that’s
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
the
net
figure.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
for
that
$73,000.00.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
or
any
other
year.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
that
it
was
just
a
mere
change
in
form.
the
government
in
their
brief
cast
this
poll
of
an
expected
double
deduction
that
the
code
is
to
be
construed
to
prevent
double
deductions.
we
took
no
double
deduction.
we
set
it
up
on
the
corporate
books
without
deducting
against
corporate
income.
our
taxpayer
considers
his
stock
to
be
worth
net.
the
section’s
both
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
came
into
the
section
coincidentally
in
1921.
the
same
year
that
the
predecessor
of
our
tax-free
organization
section
351
came
in,
we
have
found
no
case,
nor
has
the
government
cited
any
case
since
1921
where
any
corporation
has
so
a
second
deduction
or
any
taxpayer
has
tried
to
take
a
second
deduction.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
they
pay
the
partner's
cash
in
the
face
amount?
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
they
would
take
--
well,
that’s
a
difficult
question
to
immediately
answer
for
this
reason,
they
would
say
that
if
you
had
a
non
--
if
you
had
a
taxable
sale
of
the
receivables
at
net,
face
amount
less
the
reserve
that
under
--
that
there
is
no
income
because
they
seek
to
offset
a
return
of
the
reserve
to
income
by
a
loss
on
the
receivables.
now
if
you
had,
they
say
however
in
our
situation,
this
is
a
tax-free
exchange
which
precludes
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
therefore
there
is
no
loss
that
can
be
recognized
to
the
transferring
partners
to
offset
the
return
of
the
reserve
to
income
so
that
their
position
in
a
taxable
exchange
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
income
but
if
we
had
a
transfer
of
the
receivables
in
exchange
for
cash
in
a
nontaxable
environment,
then
their
answer
would
probably
be
the
same.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
their
result
would
not
be
any
different.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
had
the
corporation
instead
of
turning
up
a
reserve
simply
established
on
its
books
receivables
at
the
net
amount
of
$414,000.00,
the
net
amount,
their
answer
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
they
still
think
we
realized
income.
now,
they
cite
which
i
think
is
a
good
case
and
i
wish
i
had
cited
it,
the
skelly
oil
opinion
where
they
say
that
the
court
will
not
permit
any
double
deduction
and
i
believe
that
with
that
decision,
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
if
a
corporation
tried
to
come
into
court
later
on,
or
a
taxpayer
tried
to
come
into
court
to
get
a
second
deduction
that
that
would
ever
be
allowed.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
this
is
what
would
happen,
mr.
justice
burger.
the
corporation
would
then
have
recovered
the
full
amount
of
its
receivables.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
would
go
into
income
by
the
corporation.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
and
if
that
happened
quite
soon
after
the
incorporation,
i
think
the
commissioner
would
come
in
and
say
the
reserve
wasn't
reasonable
in
amount
and
would
probably
seek
to
have
the
partnership
pay
some
income
tax
on
it
because
if
the
reserve
is
not
reasonable,
he’s
got
other
rules
that
they
would
apply
and
we
would
not
argue
with
it
but
in
our
situation,
it
stipulated
that
the
reserve
is
reasonable.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
we
would
realize
income.
we
would
say
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
we
would
say
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
which
the
government
espouses
in
their
brief
correctly
but
doesn’t
apply,
would
apply.
the
tax
benefit
rule
which
they
say
is
the
basis
for
the
revenue
ruling
62-128
says
that
if
you
take
a
deduction
in
a
prior
year,
it
is
of
tax
benefit
in
the
prior
year
and
you
subsequently
recovered
the
deduction,
then
you
have
to
take
into
income
the
amount
of
the
recovery
in
the
year
of
the
recovery.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
you
collect
those
accounts
in,
then
you
do
have
--
in
other
words,
you
have
a
recovery
of
the
reserve.
we
say
in
this
nontaxable
situation
was
a
mere
change
in
form
that
there
is
--
and
this
was
the
philosophy
i
think
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
ignored
section
--
well,
they
mentioned
it
but
they
did
not
give
a
lot
of
weight
to
section
351.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
either
but
they
grounded
their
opinion
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
recovery,
that
the
philosophy
of
the
government
in
using
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
take
--
to
recover
the
bad
debt
in
some
future
point
should
be
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
recovery
at
some
later
year
of
the
amount
of
the
reserve
and
that
when
you
get
back
stock
certificates
representing
the
net
value
of
the
assets
transferred,
the
accounts
receivable
less
the
value,
that
there
was
no
recovery.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
well,
you
would
pay
a
--
you
would
not
have
an
immediate
recognition
at
the
beginning
where
you
could
have
a
higher
rate
or
you
could
have
a
lower
rate
i
imagine.
at
that
time
--
either
way
at
that
time,
the
corporation
takes
it
back
into
its
income
depending
on
the
two
rate
structures.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
you
see
what
would
happen,
we
would
take
it
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
i
don't
--
we
really
not
put
it
to
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
if
we
had
to
take
--
if
the
partners
took
the
$73,000.00
worth
of
receivables
into
income,
then
they
would
--
they
say
in
their
brief
that
the
corporation
would
then
be
entitled
to
set
up
a
$73,000.00
reserve
for
bad
debts
in
its
first
year.
now
if
the
corporation
chose
to
do
that
and
take
a
deduction
of
$73,000.00
in
its
first
year
and
later
recovered
the
$73,000.00
--
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
that's
right,
it’s
been
paid
but
you
could
have
--
if
you
had
a
second
deduction
under
their
theory
you
could
have
a
second
tax
to
pay
on
it.
we
say
that
would
just
really
distort
the
income
of
the
new
corporation
giving
it
a
whopping
big
deduction
in
the
first
year
when
it
has
no
earnings
necessarily,
it's
not
related
to
any
business
activity
and
creates
an
income
item
to
the
partnership.
i
see
that
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
i.
apolinsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
statement
of
mr.
zinn
points
up
the
problem
they
have
in
applying
the
tax
benefit
rule
realistically.
they
set
forth
the
rule
but
they
don’t
apply
certainly
in
the
taxable
exchange
area
when
there's
a
cash
sale
of
accounts
receivable.
the
rule
as
set
forth
in
their
brief
says
you
restore
to
income
a
deduction
when
you
recover
it.
well,
if
you
have
a
sale
for
the
receivables
at
gross,
that’s
a
recovery
and
it
would
come
in
income.
if
you
have
a
sale
at
net,
the
most
logical
conclusion
seems
to
me
is
that
you
have
no
recovery
under
the
tax
benefit
rule
and
therefore
there’s
no
income
to
the
taxpayer
selling
in
a
taxable
transaction.
the
government
in
order
to
bend
the
rule
to
fit
our
tax
free
situation
sets
up
a
hypothesis
that
they
have
a
loss
realized
on
the
receivables
which
counteracts
the
return
to
income
of
the
reserve
and
the
wash
result
is
a
net
of
zero.
we
say
that's
an
incorrect
approach
to
the
problem.
the
loss
occurred
when
the
taxpayer
got
the
deduction
for
the
reserve.
when
you
set
it
up,
that's
when
the
deduction
occurred.
the
fact
that
later
on,
he
sold
it
net
was
merely
a
realization
that
his
estimate,
his
loss
was
correct,
not
a
subsequent
loss
down
the
road
to
offset
some
artificial
inclusion
in
income.
we
further
say
that
we
do
not
agree
in
our
brief
and
our
brief,
i
think
shows
that,
that
there
is
a
different
rule
to
apply
in
section
337
liquidations.
we
don't
--
i
did
not
cover
that
because
it’s
covered
in
my
brief
but
mr.
zinn
said
that
we
did
agree
and
we
do
not.
in
fact,
the
revenue
ruling
in
1957
where
the
government
covered
the
liquidation
under
a
one
year
liquidation
rule
specifically
set
up
the
hypothesis
that
the
corporation
sold
its
receivables
at
face.
and
they
said,
therefore
the
reserve
comes
back
into
income.
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
tax
benefit
rule
in
its
proper
application
and
i've
set
out
that
entire
revenue
ruling
in
the
last
page
of
my
appendix.
i
also
take
issue
with
mr.
zinn
when
he
disputes
whether
upon
the
liquidation
of
a
partnership
the
reserve
comes
into
income
of
the
partners.
in
my
judgment,
in
a
pro
rata
liquidation
of
a
partnership
under
section
736,
there
is
no
recognition
of
income
to
the
partners.
i
would
just
focus
our
attention
if
i
will
on
the
question,
the
government
has
assumed
as
we
said
that
there
is
a
problem
of
a
double
deduction.
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
problem
of
a
double
deduction
because
there
has
been
no,
in
our
case,
no
one
has
tried
to
take
a
second
deduction
and
in
no
case
discussed
today
or
in
any
of
the
brief
has
any
taxpayer
attempted
to
take
a
second
deduction
at
any
stage.
so
that
the
basis
hypothesis
for
the
need
for
the
revenue
ruling
it
seems
to
me
unfounded
that
there
is
not
second
deduction
to
guard
against
and
therefore,
without
that
problem,
there’s
no
need
to
even
travel
under
7805
but
under
that
section,
the
solution
if
we
were
to
assume
for
argument
there’s
a
problem.
under
that
section,
the
solution
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
statute.
we
say
that
section
351
which
says
no
gain
or
loss
if
property
is
transferred,
if,
it
doesn’t
say
from
property,
it’s
not
tied
to
the
property.
it
says
if
property
is
transferred,
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
points
out
that
that’s
not
a
taxable
event,
it’s
just
a
change
of
form
and
in
1924,
congress
in
reviewing
it
said,
no
gain
or
loss
and
in
the
next
sentence,
it
says,
this
is
not
a
time
for
the
realization
of
income.
so
we
say
there
is
no
magic
in
saying
what
we
have
over
here
is
income
and
the
statute
said
no
gain,
loss
or
income
because
in
1924,
they
used
the
two
terms
interchangeably.
certainly,
the
cure
to
the
illness
should
not
be
worse
than
the
illness
itself
and
that’s
what’s
going
to
happen
if
we
restore
to
the
partnership
this
income.
it
creates
artificial
tax
planning.
partners,
proprietors,
transfer
into
corporations
can't
put
receivables
into
their
corporations
because
if
that
mature
the
reserve
for
bad
debts,
they
would
not
then
have
any
cash
to
pay
the
income
tax
with.
so
what's
happened
since
1962
is
that
people
with
reserve
for
bad
debts
have
been
artificially
holding
out
their
receivables,
or
else
possibly
making
cash
sales
at
nets
to
third
parties
to
create
what
the
government
says
is
a
wash
situation.
that
--
and
this
is
a
recurring
problem.
the
government
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
agrees
that
we
have
incorporations
of
businesses
everyday
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
we
should
not
visit
the
need
for
some
artificial
planning.
congress
in
1921
said,
to
order,
to
encourage
business
readjustments
and
even
spoke
of
artificial
transactions
that
they
were
going
to
place
this
tax
free
environment.
the
simplest
thing
i
think
is
not
to
look
to
a
specific
solution
to
a
double
deduction,
we
say
there
isn’t
or
to
simply
for
the
court
to
remind
the
tax
bar
is
we
don’t
need
reminding
of
your
decision
of
skelly
oil.
there
is
just
not
going
to
be
any
second
deduction
allowed
irrespective
of
which
particular
route
is
followed
and
we
urge
that
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed
and
that
the
district
court's
decision
be
affirmed
so
that
the
partnership
in
this
situation
would
not
take
into
its
income
the
reserve
for
bad
debts.
