mr.

you
may

you’re

chief

e.

what
would
have
happened
to
this
reserve
if
they
have
liquidated
mr.
apolinsky?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
just
liquidated
it
would've
--
would
it
have
gone
into
ordinary
income
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
have
entered
the
transaction
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
might
test
your
position
from
another
angle.
suppose,
this
is
a
large
hypothetical
because
it
wouldn't
happen,
but
suppose
after
the
corporate
reorganization
was
completed,
the
corporation
was
taken
over,
someone
came
along
and
offered
to
buy
all
of
the
receivables
of
the
new
corporation
which
had
just
been
transferred
to
it
for
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
then
what
would
happen
to
the
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
charged
all
of
the
bad
debt
loss,
the
reserve
would
go
into
income
then
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
hasn't
happened
and
never
will
happen
unless
some
fairy
godmother
comes
along
and
buys
these
at
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
isn’t
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
apolinsky.
mr.
zinn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
underway,
would
you
clarify
perhaps
for
all
of
us
but
at
least
for
me,
what
has
changed
here
in
your
judgment
by
this
transfer
except
the
form
and
structure
of
doing
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
change
in
substance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zinn,
when
this
transfer
occurred,
i
assume
that
in
the
eight
offices
of
the
corporation
and
partnership
later
the
corporation,
they
had
typewriters,
desks,
chairs
and
a
lot
of
office
equipment.
let's
assume
just
hypothetically
that
that
equipment
was
worth
and
had
an
original
cost
of
$50,000.00
and
then
have
been
depreciated
down
to
$25,000.00.
would
you
say
that
now
that
it’s
transferred
to
the
corporation
that
depreciation
which
is
a
hypothetical
recognition
or
a
prophesy
as
is
the
bad
debt
deduction
should
now
be
charged
back
as
income
to
the
partners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
function
of
the
bad
debt
loss
is
essentially
in
principle
the
same
as
the
function
of
a
depreciation
for
obsolescence
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
isn't
necessarily
true
as
a
matter
of
reality,
in
a
period
of
rising
costs,
it
frequently
occurs
that
assets
long
since
depreciated
down
to
zero
become
worth
a
great
deal
and
then
the
government
on
liquidation
recovers
that,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zinn,
you
may
pick
up
where
you
left
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
distinguish
it
in
that
respect
from
a
depreciation
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
partnership
could
have
sold
and
assigned
accounts
receivable
independently
of
this
tax
free
transfer
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
sold
it
for
the
net
amount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
wash
transaction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

you
have
some
time
left
to

mr.
