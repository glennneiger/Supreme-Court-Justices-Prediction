mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
precisely
all
that
has
changed
mr.
chief
justice,
just
the
form
in
which
the
business
is
carried
on.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct
although
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
section
351
transfers
can
apply
where
an
entire
business
becomes
a
corporation
or
where
a
single
asset
on
account
receivable
or
any
other
single
asset
is
transferred
from
an
individual
or
partnership
to
a
controlled
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
financing,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
so.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice
black.
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
reserve
that
was
on
the
books
of
the
corporation
at
that
time
of
the
transfer,
on
the
books
of
the
partnership,
excuse
me,
at
that
time
of
the
transfer,
was
reasonable
if
the
partnership
continued
in
business.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
partnership
didn't
continue
in
the
business.
the
partnership
was
terminated
and
all
of
its
assets
including
its
accounts
receivable
which
were
transferred
to
the
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
think
that
when
a
partnership
terminates
or
when
an
entity
terminates,
the
tax
benefit
principle
requires
that
a
deduction
be
restored
to
income
because
subsequent
events
have
demonstrated
that
that
entity
is
not
entitled
to
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
if
the
partnership
and
corporation
are
considered
to
be
separate
entities,
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
much
question
that
the
partnership’s
need
for
the
reserve
ended.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
schmidt
case
upon
which
petitioners
rely
determined
that
the
need
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
form
of
the
business
as
the
chief
justice
asked.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
and
mr.
apolinsky
this
morning
and
in
his
brief
has
relied
heavily
on
the
legislative
history
of
section
351
which
provides
for
the
nonrecognition
of
gain
or
loss.
but
he
did
not
read
the
language
of
the
statute
to
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
do
that.
it
says
that
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
if
property
is
transferred
to
a
corporation
by
one
or
more
persons
solely
in
exchange
for
stock
or
securities.
and
immediately
after
the
exchange
such
person
is
in
control
of
the
corporation.
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized.
gain
or
loss
is
a
statutory
term
of
art.
it
can
arise
only
when
property
is
transferred.
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
not
property.
it
is
merely
a
bookkeeping
entry
on
the
books
of
the
partnership.
it
cannot
be
transferred
and
nothing
in
section
351
bars
the
application
of
a
tax
benefit
principle
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
transferring
only
the
receivables.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
section
351
only
prohibits
the
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
restoring
the
reserve
income
under
the
tax
benefit
principle
is
not
a
recognition
of
gain
or
loss.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
there’s
no
--
i
think
the
point
is
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
that
precludes
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
principle
in
this
case.
that
principle
is
well
established.
the
need
for
the
reserve
here
we
think
has
terminated
because
the
partnership
has
terminated.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
have
received
--
the
partnership
has
received
the
benefit
of
a
deduction
to
which
they
are
no
longer
entitled.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
i
think
the
accounts
receivable
are
separate
from
the
reserve.
let
me
point
out
mr.
justice
white
that
when
a
corporation
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
know
if
there's
anything
attractive
about
it.
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
view
the
problem
here
as
initially
one
of
avoiding
a
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
concern
we
have
initially,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
a
deduction
will
be
granted
to
the
partnership
as
it
was
here
and
then
that
it
will
pay
second
deduction
will
be
granted
to
the
transferee
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
they
would
try
not
to
mr.
justice
white
but
i
don’t
think
we
can
rule
out
that
possibility.
judge
duniway
in
his
opinion
in
the
schmidt
case
specifically
left
open
the
question
as
to
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
i
don’t
think
that's
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
want
to
ensure
against
the
double
deduction.
the
code
doesn’t
specifically
tell
us
which
way
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
say
they
have
received
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
the
deduction
for
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
a
fiction
too.
we
are
allowing
a
deduction
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
recovery.
if
we
view
the
partnership
as
a
separate
entity,
there
is
a
recovery
of
that
deduction
and
we
think
that
the
code
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
that
liquidates
tax
free
under
section
336,
and
distributes
all
of
its
assets
to
its
shareholders
in
liquidation,
it
is
clear
that
the
corporation
must
restore
the
reserve
to
income
even
though
it
didn't
collect
the
amount
of
the
reserve
for
bad
debts.
all
it's
getting
back
are
pieces
of
paper
just
like
the
partners
are
receiving
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
you
haven't
held
it
but
such
holdings
as
they
are,
are
consistent
with
that
and
petitioners
conceived
that
in
their
brief
that
on
a
liquidation
of
a
corporation,
there
is
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
would
not
mr.
chief
justice
but
that
is
because
section
1245
and
section
1250
of
the
code
specifically
so
provide.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
similar
although
some
of
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
including
the
west
seattle
bank
case
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
insofar
as
i
can
understand
the
distinction
and
it’s
rather
murky,
it
is
that
with
respect
to
accounts
receivable
and
a
reserve
for
bad
debts,
you
cannot
be
certain
that
any
particular
account
will
become
worthless,
whereas
you
have
some
greater
degree
of
assurance
that
wear
and
tear
and
obsolescence
will
gradually
diminish
the
value
of
an
asset.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
agree
that
they
would
and
i
think
that
they
would
recover
it
here
but
for
the
fact
that
we
have
specific
statutory
provisions
that
apply.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
investment
credit
area,
the
government
wouldn’t
be
taking
a
position
that
it’s
taking
here
because
section
47
(b)
of
the
code
provides
that
property
shall
not
be
treated
as
ceasing
to
be
investment
credit
property
with
respect
to
the
taxpayer
by
reason
of
a
mere
change
in
the
form
of
conducting
the
trade
or
business.
had
a
provision
like
that
been
included
in
the
code
in
section
351,
we
wouldn't
be
here
in
court
today.
but
the
fact
is,
that
section
351
only
prohibits
the
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
tax
gain
or
loss
in
this
situation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
our
position
here
is
that
the
internal
revenue
code
doesn’t
tell
us
which
way
to
handle
this
double
deduction
problem.
that
the
commissioner
has
determined
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
it
is
to
restore
the
bad
debt
reserve
to
income
under
the
tax
benefit
rule.
that
application
of
a
tax
benefit
rule
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
all
statutory
provisions
and
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
so
long
as
the
commissioner’s
solution
to
the
double
deduction
problem
is
reasonable,
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
when
he
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
when
he
obtained
the
deduction
for
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
say
he
received
it
because
he
obtained
a
deduction
when
he
set
up
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
for
a
loss
he
did
not
suffer.
for
a
loss
that
would
be
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no.
no,
we're
saying
that
when
he
set
up
the
reserve
for
bad
debts,
he
got
a
deduction
for
a
loss
that
he
had
not
yet
suffered
and
now
since
the
partnership
is
terminating
and
since
the
partnership
never
incurred
those
losses,
he
must
restore
the
bad
debt
reserve
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
that
the
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
take
a
deduction
because
it
would
have
suffered
the
losses.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
because
it
suffered
the
losses.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
the
corporation
is
entitled
to
the
deduction
because
it
suffered
the
losses.
it
actually
suffered
them.
the
partnership
here
did
not
suffer
the
bad
debt
losses
which
obtained
through
creation
of
the
reserve.
the
reserve
is
an
estimate
of
future
losses
and
the
partnership
never
suffered
those
losses
and
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
it’s
entitled
to
retain
the
benefit
of
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
our
concern
is
that
if
that
--
the
partnership
has
already
gotten
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
corporation
will
get
a
deduction
for
the
same
accounts
receivable.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
which
way
to
avoid
the
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct,
except
that
i
would
add
to
that
that
we
think
our
way
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--
is
more
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
particularly
those
of
subchapter
c
which
this
court
recognized
last
term
and
commissioner
and
gordon
are
very,
very
technical.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
we
think
that
mr.
apolinsky’s
arguments
are
very
persuasive
in
terms
of
perhaps
revising
the
internal
revenue
code
and
making
section
351
read
the
same
way
that
section
47
(b)
reads
that
if
it’s
so
long
as
the
same
business
is
continuing,
no
income
will
be
recognized.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
that's
not
what
the
code
says.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
don't
seek
to
deny
it
twice,
mr.
justice
black.
we
would
allow
it
to
a
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
and
tha'’s
all
they
seek.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh!
no,
but
the
petitioners
here
didn’t
suffer
the
loss
that
they
are
claiming.
the
corporation
suffered
the
loss
and
that's
whom
we
want
to
allow
it
to.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
at
which
way?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
which
way.
now,
mr.
apolinsky
has
pointed
out
both
in
his
brief
and
here
this
morning
that
the
corporation
set
up
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
on
its
books
and
therefore
didn’t
claim
it
twice.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
have
confirmed
that
but
is
extra
record
information.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
except
as
a
matter
of
tidiness.
mr.
apolinsky
also
mentioned
this
morning
that
on
a
liquidation
of
a
partnership,
there
would
be
no
restoration
of
the
reserve
to
income.
there
is
no
case
law
on
that
question.
there
is
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
a
case
law
on
the
question
of
liquidation
of
corporation
which
indicates
that
there
would
be
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
would
be
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
if
this
partnership
liquidated.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
they
might
realize.
they
would
realize
no
net
income,
mr.
justice
white
because
presumably
the
restoration
of
the
reserve
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
think
there
would
be
restoration
of
the
reserve.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
but
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
loss
deduction
for
$75,000.00
because
the
basis
of
the
receivables
in
their
hands
would
be
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables,
we
think,
not
the
net
amount.[recess]
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
two
proposed
solutions
of
petitioners
to
the
double
deduction
problem
here.
that
is
the
carryover
solution
and
the
adjustment
of
basis
solution.
section
381
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
the
principal
provision
which
allows
for
carryovers
in
certain
transactions.
that
provision
does
not
apply
to
transactions
such
as
the
one
here
which
is
described
in
section
351.
it
applies
only
to
certain
intercorporate
transactions.
in
addition
to
the
fact,
the
absence
in
section
381
of
a
specific
congressional
authorization
for
a
carryover,
it
is
well
established
that
a
transferee
in
a
section
351
transaction
is
a
new
taxpayer
and
can
adopt
its
own
accounting
methods
and
its
own
taxable
year
including
in
this
specific
case
the
specific
charge
off
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts.
we
think
therefore
that
there
is
a
real
risk
of
a
double
deduction
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
tax
benefit
principle
is
not
applicable
here.
third,
we
point
out
that
congress
has
been
quite
specific
when
it
wanted
items
to
be
carried
over
in
a
section
351
transaction.
thus,
section
362
of
the
code
provides
that
the
basis
of
property
shall
be
carried
over.
as
i
attempted
to
outline
for
the
court
this
morning
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
not
property
similar
carryover
rules
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
a
depreciation
reserve
is
not
property
either
but
under
section
1016
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
depreciation
reserve
is
specifically
provided
to
reduce
the
basis
of
the
depreciable
asset.
that's
under
section
1016
(a)
(2),
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
specific
provision
that
is
comparable
to
that
allowing
a
basis
reduction
for
a
bad
debt
reserve.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
attempting
to
analogize
a
section
351
transaction
and
to
bring
it
within
the
spirit
if
not
the
specific
language
of
section
381,
that
section
381
applies
only
to
transfers
of
entire
businesses.
whereas
section
351
as
i
mentioned
before
the
recess
can
apply
to
a
transfer
of
an
entire
business
as
in
this
case
or
to
transfer
of
a
single
asset.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
in
that
case,
the
basis
would
be
what
it
paid
for
it
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
its
basis
would
be.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
it
issued
stock
and
cash?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
it
was
a
taxable
transaction?
well,
then
its
basis
would
be
the
net
value
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables
less
the
reserve.
that
would
be
the
corporation's
basis
but
that’s
not
the
corporation's
basis
in
this
case
according
to
the
specific
provisions
of
section
1016
(a)
of
the
code.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
know
if
i
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
requires
mr.
justice
white.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
overriding
principle
that’s
applicable
here
is
no
double
deduction,
the
principle
that
this
court
reaffirmed
last
term
in
skelly
oil.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
say
that
the
code
doesn’t
specifically
answer
the
question
that’s
presented
here,
how
to
avoid
the
double
deduction.
now,
we
think
the
better
way
to
answer
the
question
is
to
answer
it
by
applying
the
tax
benefit
principle
but
if
the
court
says
that
isn’t
the
better
way
to
do
it,
then
we
think
that
the
basis
adjustment
should
be
made.
the
code
just
doesn't
speak
specifically
to
the
point
and
we
have
to
comply
with
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
partnership,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
tax
benefit
principle
doesn't
apply
here,
then
the
basis
of
the
receivables
should
be
reduced
to
net
in
the
hands
of
the
corporation
so
as
to
avoid
a
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
you
wouldn't
pay
more
than
the
true
value
for
them,
you
pay
the
net
amount.
then
your
basis
would
be
what
you
pay.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
think
we
have
to
say
that
the
corporation
paid
the
face
amount.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
section
351
provides
--
section
362
provides
that
the
basis
of
property
in
the
hands
of
the
transferee
corporation
shall
be
the
same
as
in
the
hands
of
the
transferor.
that
basis
at
least
so
far
as
good
interpretation
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
concerned
would
be
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
in
our
position,
if
it
had
done
that
would
be
precisely
what
it
is
here
that
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
has
to
be
restored
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
they
sold
it
for
the
net
amount
and
if
they
are
entitled
to
a
loss
measured
by
the
difference
between
the
face
amount
and
the
net
amount
because
that
is
a
sale
of
property
and
on
a
sale
of
property,
accounts
receivable
with
a
basis
of
let’s
say
$100.00,
for
a
net
value
of
90,
they’re
entitled
to
a
loss
of
$10.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
would
be
in
most
cases
mr.
chief
justice
because
accounts
receivable
under
section
12214
of
the
code
would
be
an
ordinary
income
asset.
but
if
the
accounts
receivable
happened
to
be
a
capital
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
selling
entity
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited,
then
the
gain
or
the
loss
would
be
a
capital
loss
and
the
restoration
to
income
would
be
a
restoration
to
ordinary
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right
because
the
corporation
will
suffer
the
loss.
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
reserve
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts
is
to
better
match
costs
against
revenue
just
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
but
that
purpose
was
never
intended
to
provide
a
loss
to
an
entity
that
didn't
suffer
it
and
that
once
we
know
that
the
partnership
entity
is
terminated,
the
partnership
should
not
wind
up
with
any
more
bad
debt
deductions
than
it
would
have
wound
up
would
had
it
been
on
the
specific
charge
off
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts.
and
had
it
been
on
this
specific
charge
off
method,
it
would
not
have
gotten
this
deduction
for
future
losses
which
it
took
and
which
we
submit
has
to
be
restored
to
income
when
the
partnership
terminates.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
precisely
all
that
has
changed
mr.
chief
justice,
just
the
form
in
which
the
business
is
carried
on.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct
although
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
section
351
transfers
can
apply
where
an
entire
business
becomes
a
corporation
or
where
a
single
asset
on
account
receivable
or
any
other
single
asset
is
transferred
from
an
individual
or
partnership
to
a
controlled
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
financing,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
believe
so.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice
black.
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
reserve
that
was
on
the
books
of
the
corporation
at
that
time
of
the
transfer,
on
the
books
of
the
partnership,
excuse
me,
at
that
time
of
the
transfer,
was
reasonable
if
the
partnership
continued
in
business.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
partnership
didn't
continue
in
the
business.
the
partnership
was
terminated
and
all
of
its
assets
including
its
accounts
receivable
which
were
transferred
to
the
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
think
that
when
a
partnership
terminates
or
when
an
entity
terminates,
the
tax
benefit
principle
requires
that
a
deduction
be
restored
to
income
because
subsequent
events
have
demonstrated
that
that
entity
is
not
entitled
to
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
if
the
partnership
and
corporation
are
considered
to
be
separate
entities,
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
much
question
that
the
partnership’s
need
for
the
reserve
ended.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
schmidt
case
upon
which
petitioners
rely
determined
that
the
need
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
form
of
the
business
as
the
chief
justice
asked.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct
and
mr.
apolinsky
this
morning
and
in
his
brief
has
relied
heavily
on
the
legislative
history
of
section
351
which
provides
for
the
nonrecognition
of
gain
or
loss.
but
he
did
not
read
the
language
of
the
statute
to
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
do
that.
it
says
that
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
if
property
is
transferred
to
a
corporation
by
one
or
more
persons
solely
in
exchange
for
stock
or
securities.
and
immediately
after
the
exchange
such
person
is
in
control
of
the
corporation.
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized.
gain
or
loss
is
a
statutory
term
of
art.
it
can
arise
only
when
property
is
transferred.
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
not
property.
it
is
merely
a
bookkeeping
entry
on
the
books
of
the
partnership.
it
cannot
be
transferred
and
nothing
in
section
351
bars
the
application
of
a
tax
benefit
principle
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
transferring
only
the
receivables.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
section
351
only
prohibits
the
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
restoring
the
reserve
income
under
the
tax
benefit
principle
is
not
a
recognition
of
gain
or
loss.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
there’s
no
--
i
think
the
point
is
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
that
precludes
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
principle
in
this
case.
that
principle
is
well
established.
the
need
for
the
reserve
here
we
think
has
terminated
because
the
partnership
has
terminated.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
have
received
--
the
partnership
has
received
the
benefit
of
a
deduction
to
which
they
are
no
longer
entitled.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
i
think
the
accounts
receivable
are
separate
from
the
reserve.
let
me
point
out
mr.
justice
white
that
when
a
corporation
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
know
if
there's
anything
attractive
about
it.
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
view
the
problem
here
as
initially
one
of
avoiding
a
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
concern
we
have
initially,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
a
deduction
will
be
granted
to
the
partnership
as
it
was
here
and
then
that
it
will
pay
second
deduction
will
be
granted
to
the
transferee
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
think
they
would
try
not
to
mr.
justice
white
but
i
don’t
think
we
can
rule
out
that
possibility.
judge
duniway
in
his
opinion
in
the
schmidt
case
specifically
left
open
the
question
as
to
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
i
don’t
think
that's
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
want
to
ensure
against
the
double
deduction.
the
code
doesn’t
specifically
tell
us
which
way
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
we
say
they
have
received
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
the
deduction
for
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
a
fiction
too.
we
are
allowing
a
deduction
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
recovery.
if
we
view
the
partnership
as
a
separate
entity,
there
is
a
recovery
of
that
deduction
and
we
think
that
the
code
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
that
liquidates
tax
free
under
section
336,
and
distributes
all
of
its
assets
to
its
shareholders
in
liquidation,
it
is
clear
that
the
corporation
must
restore
the
reserve
to
income
even
though
it
didn't
collect
the
amount
of
the
reserve
for
bad
debts.
all
it's
getting
back
are
pieces
of
paper
just
like
the
partners
are
receiving
here.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
you
haven't
held
it
but
such
holdings
as
they
are,
are
consistent
with
that
and
petitioners
conceived
that
in
their
brief
that
on
a
liquidation
of
a
corporation,
there
is
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
would
not
mr.
chief
justice
but
that
is
because
section
1245
and
section
1250
of
the
code
specifically
so
provide.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
they
are
similar
although
some
of
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
including
the
west
seattle
bank
case
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
insofar
as
i
can
understand
the
distinction
and
it’s
rather
murky,
it
is
that
with
respect
to
accounts
receivable
and
a
reserve
for
bad
debts,
you
cannot
be
certain
that
any
particular
account
will
become
worthless,
whereas
you
have
some
greater
degree
of
assurance
that
wear
and
tear
and
obsolescence
will
gradually
diminish
the
value
of
an
asset.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
agree
that
they
would
and
i
think
that
they
would
recover
it
here
but
for
the
fact
that
we
have
specific
statutory
provisions
that
apply.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
investment
credit
area,
the
government
wouldn’t
be
taking
a
position
that
it’s
taking
here
because
section
47
(b)
of
the
code
provides
that
property
shall
not
be
treated
as
ceasing
to
be
investment
credit
property
with
respect
to
the
taxpayer
by
reason
of
a
mere
change
in
the
form
of
conducting
the
trade
or
business.
had
a
provision
like
that
been
included
in
the
code
in
section
351,
we
wouldn't
be
here
in
court
today.
but
the
fact
is,
that
section
351
only
prohibits
the
recognition
of
gain
or
loss
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
tax
gain
or
loss
in
this
situation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
our
position
here
is
that
the
internal
revenue
code
doesn’t
tell
us
which
way
to
handle
this
double
deduction
problem.
that
the
commissioner
has
determined
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
it
is
to
restore
the
bad
debt
reserve
to
income
under
the
tax
benefit
rule.
that
application
of
a
tax
benefit
rule
here
is
entirely
consistent
with
all
statutory
provisions
and
that
under
decisions
of
this
court,
so
long
as
the
commissioner’s
solution
to
the
double
deduction
problem
is
reasonable,
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
when
he
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
but
when
he
obtained
the
deduction
for
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
say
he
received
it
because
he
obtained
a
deduction
when
he
set
up
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
for
a
loss
he
did
not
suffer.
for
a
loss
that
would
be
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no.
no,
we're
saying
that
when
he
set
up
the
reserve
for
bad
debts,
he
got
a
deduction
for
a
loss
that
he
had
not
yet
suffered
and
now
since
the
partnership
is
terminating
and
since
the
partnership
never
incurred
those
losses,
he
must
restore
the
bad
debt
reserve
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
we
think
that
the
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
take
a
deduction
because
it
would
have
suffered
the
losses.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
because
it
suffered
the
losses.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
the
corporation
is
entitled
to
the
deduction
because
it
suffered
the
losses.
it
actually
suffered
them.
the
partnership
here
did
not
suffer
the
bad
debt
losses
which
obtained
through
creation
of
the
reserve.
the
reserve
is
an
estimate
of
future
losses
and
the
partnership
never
suffered
those
losses
and
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
it’s
entitled
to
retain
the
benefit
of
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
our
concern
is
that
if
that
--
the
partnership
has
already
gotten
the
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
corporation
will
get
a
deduction
for
the
same
accounts
receivable.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right,
which
way
to
avoid
the
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct,
except
that
i
would
add
to
that
that
we
think
our
way
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
--
is
more
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
particularly
those
of
subchapter
c
which
this
court
recognized
last
term
and
commissioner
and
gordon
are
very,
very
technical.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
now,
we
think
that
mr.
apolinsky’s
arguments
are
very
persuasive
in
terms
of
perhaps
revising
the
internal
revenue
code
and
making
section
351
read
the
same
way
that
section
47
(b)
reads
that
if
it’s
so
long
as
the
same
business
is
continuing,
no
income
will
be
recognized.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
that's
not
what
the
code
says.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
don't
seek
to
deny
it
twice,
mr.
justice
black.
we
would
allow
it
to
a
corporation.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
and
tha'’s
all
they
seek.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
oh!
no,
but
the
petitioners
here
didn’t
suffer
the
loss
that
they
are
claiming.
the
corporation
suffered
the
loss
and
that's
whom
we
want
to
allow
it
to.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
at
which
way?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
which
way.
now,
mr.
apolinsky
has
pointed
out
both
in
his
brief
and
here
this
morning
that
the
corporation
set
up
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
on
its
books
and
therefore
didn’t
claim
it
twice.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
have
confirmed
that
but
is
extra
record
information.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
except
as
a
matter
of
tidiness.
mr.
apolinsky
also
mentioned
this
morning
that
on
a
liquidation
of
a
partnership,
there
would
be
no
restoration
of
the
reserve
to
income.
there
is
no
case
law
on
that
question.
there
is
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
a
case
law
on
the
question
of
liquidation
of
corporation
which
indicates
that
there
would
be
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
would
be
a
restoration
of
the
reserve
if
this
partnership
liquidated.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
they
might
realize.
they
would
realize
no
net
income,
mr.
justice
white
because
presumably
the
restoration
of
the
reserve
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
we
think
there
would
be
restoration
of
the
reserve.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that’s
right.
but
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
loss
deduction
for
$75,000.00
because
the
basis
of
the
receivables
in
their
hands
would
be
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables,
we
think,
not
the
net
amount.[recess]
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
two
proposed
solutions
of
petitioners
to
the
double
deduction
problem
here.
that
is
the
carryover
solution
and
the
adjustment
of
basis
solution.
section
381
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
the
principal
provision
which
allows
for
carryovers
in
certain
transactions.
that
provision
does
not
apply
to
transactions
such
as
the
one
here
which
is
described
in
section
351.
it
applies
only
to
certain
intercorporate
transactions.
in
addition
to
the
fact,
the
absence
in
section
381
of
a
specific
congressional
authorization
for
a
carryover,
it
is
well
established
that
a
transferee
in
a
section
351
transaction
is
a
new
taxpayer
and
can
adopt
its
own
accounting
methods
and
its
own
taxable
year
including
in
this
specific
case
the
specific
charge
off
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts.
we
think
therefore
that
there
is
a
real
risk
of
a
double
deduction
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
tax
benefit
principle
is
not
applicable
here.
third,
we
point
out
that
congress
has
been
quite
specific
when
it
wanted
items
to
be
carried
over
in
a
section
351
transaction.
thus,
section
362
of
the
code
provides
that
the
basis
of
property
shall
be
carried
over.
as
i
attempted
to
outline
for
the
court
this
morning
a
reserve
for
bad
debts
is
not
property
similar
carryover
rules
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
a
depreciation
reserve
is
not
property
either
but
under
section
1016
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
depreciation
reserve
is
specifically
provided
to
reduce
the
basis
of
the
depreciable
asset.
that's
under
section
1016
(a)
(2),
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
specific
provision
that
is
comparable
to
that
allowing
a
basis
reduction
for
a
bad
debt
reserve.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
attempting
to
analogize
a
section
351
transaction
and
to
bring
it
within
the
spirit
if
not
the
specific
language
of
section
381,
that
section
381
applies
only
to
transfers
of
entire
businesses.
whereas
section
351
as
i
mentioned
before
the
recess
can
apply
to
a
transfer
of
an
entire
business
as
in
this
case
or
to
transfer
of
a
single
asset.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
correct.
in
that
case,
the
basis
would
be
what
it
paid
for
it
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
its
basis
would
be.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
it
issued
stock
and
cash?
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
but
it
was
a
taxable
transaction?
well,
then
its
basis
would
be
the
net
value
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables
less
the
reserve.
that
would
be
the
corporation's
basis
but
that’s
not
the
corporation's
basis
in
this
case
according
to
the
specific
provisions
of
section
1016
(a)
of
the
code.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
know
if
i
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
requires
mr.
justice
white.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
overriding
principle
that’s
applicable
here
is
no
double
deduction,
the
principle
that
this
court
reaffirmed
last
term
in
skelly
oil.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
we
say
that
the
code
doesn’t
specifically
answer
the
question
that’s
presented
here,
how
to
avoid
the
double
deduction.
now,
we
think
the
better
way
to
answer
the
question
is
to
answer
it
by
applying
the
tax
benefit
principle
but
if
the
court
says
that
isn’t
the
better
way
to
do
it,
then
we
think
that
the
basis
adjustment
should
be
made.
the
code
just
doesn't
speak
specifically
to
the
point
and
we
have
to
comply
with
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
well,
the
partnership,
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
tax
benefit
principle
doesn't
apply
here,
then
the
basis
of
the
receivables
should
be
reduced
to
net
in
the
hands
of
the
corporation
so
as
to
avoid
a
double
deduction.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
no,
you
wouldn't
pay
more
than
the
true
value
for
them,
you
pay
the
net
amount.
then
your
basis
would
be
what
you
pay.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
i
don't
think
we
have
to
say
that
the
corporation
paid
the
face
amount.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
section
351
provides
--
section
362
provides
that
the
basis
of
property
in
the
hands
of
the
transferee
corporation
shall
be
the
same
as
in
the
hands
of
the
transferor.
that
basis
at
least
so
far
as
good
interpretation
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
concerned
would
be
the
face
amount
of
the
receivables.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
yes,
in
our
position,
if
it
had
done
that
would
be
precisely
what
it
is
here
that
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
has
to
be
restored
to
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
if
they
sold
it
for
the
net
amount
and
if
they
are
entitled
to
a
loss
measured
by
the
difference
between
the
face
amount
and
the
net
amount
because
that
is
a
sale
of
property
and
on
a
sale
of
property,
accounts
receivable
with
a
basis
of
let’s
say
$100.00,
for
a
net
value
of
90,
they’re
entitled
to
a
loss
of
$10.00.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
it
would
be
in
most
cases
mr.
chief
justice
because
accounts
receivable
under
section
12214
of
the
code
would
be
an
ordinary
income
asset.
but
if
the
accounts
receivable
happened
to
be
a
capital
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
selling
entity
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited,
then
the
gain
or
the
loss
would
be
a
capital
loss
and
the
restoration
to
income
would
be
a
restoration
to
ordinary
income.
mr.
matthew
j.
zinn
that's
right
because
the
corporation
will
suffer
the
loss.
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
reserve
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts
is
to
better
match
costs
against
revenue
just
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
but
that
purpose
was
never
intended
to
provide
a
loss
to
an
entity
that
didn't
suffer
it
and
that
once
we
know
that
the
partnership
entity
is
terminated,
the
partnership
should
not
wind
up
with
any
more
bad
debt
deductions
than
it
would
have
wound
up
would
had
it
been
on
the
specific
charge
off
method
of
accounting
for
bad
debts.
and
had
it
been
on
this
specific
charge
off
method,
it
would
not
have
gotten
this
deduction
for
future
losses
which
it
took
and
which
we
submit
has
to
be
restored
to
income
when
the
partnership
terminates.
