at

that
there
is
some
recovery

they're
transferring
only

that
may

so.
justice

well,
just
because
there’s
nothing
in

--
that

the

principle
doesn’t

that
principle
is

what
possible
then
it
has

has
come
out

justice

they
received
the

of
it

the

agreed

now,
you
are

that
we

justice

what's
so

let's

somebody
must
treat
his

his

we
all
agreed
worth
the

he
must
pay

on

can
anybody

(inaudible)

you're
going

you
