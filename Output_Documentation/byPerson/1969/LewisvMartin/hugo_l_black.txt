justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
federal
supremacy,
all
he
can
do
is
go
pay
these
people
himself
he
can't
support
california
to
mix
up
its
fund
to
the
federal
money
and
then
according
to
the
federal
business
desires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it
can
if
it
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
merely
refuses
to
go
in
to
partnership
with
the
federal
government
on
its
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
has
a
right
to
do
so,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
where
it
has
ever
held,
where
two
litigants
have
a
controversy
among
themselves,
there
can
be
a
case
or
controversy
within
the
constitutional
sense,
when
one
of
them
has
the
right
to
settle
the
case
on
his
own
territory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
government
here
has
a
right
to
decline
that
the
state
have
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
litigant
but
it's
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
you
try
and
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
should
be
a
controversy
between
the
government
and
the
state
and
the
state
can
determine
for
itself
whether
it
accepts
the
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
that
be
a
case
of
controversy
which
calls
for
the
attention
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
trying
to
get
around
by
--
around
at
all
by
saying,
“well,
the
state
would
do
what
it
should,
we'd
get
our
money”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
doesn't
have
to
do
it.
the
state
can
decline
to
do
it
and
the
government
can
decline
to
that
amount
of
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
with
reference
to
everyone
out
there.
the
government
can
settle
it
by
not
letting
them
have
any
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
its
own.
why
should
this
court
with
all
the
burdens
it
has
multitudinous
cases
that
are
becoming
before,
undertake
a
case
of
controversy
when
there
is
not
a
case
of
controversy
between
the
two
main
persons
who
are
interested
in
this,
namely
the
state
and
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
social
security
is
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
collect
your
money
for
social
security?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
an
obligation
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
part
of
the
state,
to
certain
extent
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
under
to
be
--
based
on
agreement
which
they
can
reach
or
not
reach
as
they
seek
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
controversy
here
as
to
what
the
state
can
do
and
what
the
federal
government
can
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
has
its
own
sanction
in
its
own
hand.
it
can
stop
paying
the
state
any
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah
--
yeah,
right
indirect
claim
benefit,
you
get
a
lawsuit
settled
between
the
state
and
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
won't
this
place
us
right
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
states
understand
it,
why
should
we
have
to
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that
extent,
but
they
change
with
these
changing
dates.
we
need
the
changing
litigants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
will
have
to
abide
by
it,
and
if
we
don't
the
government
has
its
relief
in
its
own
hand.
it
can
decline
to
let
him
have
the
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
federal
government
can
at
this
moment
withdraw
its
funds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably
more
reasonable
and
to
get
this
court
mixed
status
in
every
welfare
case
that
arises
in
the
whole
range
of
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
haven't
had
this
case
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
supported
by
this
court
would
deny
that
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
when
it's
raised
in
a
case
of
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
even
if
it
was,
there's
no
sign
we
should
continue
to
be
bound
by
if
it's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
custom
is
now
arrived
whereby
everybody
bringing
every
kind
of
welfare
case
for
this
state
bringing
in
a
lap
number
of
controversies
that
we
are
simply
not
capable
on
account
of
the
lack
of
numbers,
the
lack
of
scope
to
handle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
allows
you
to
do
what
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
while
the
state
and
federal
government
when
negotiation
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
your
state
was
in
compliance
that
this
suit
was
filed
on
the
part
of
the
led
individual
beneficiary
in
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
received
ever
since
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
between
you
and
the
alleged
beneficiaries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
between
california
and
the
alleged
beneficiary,
that's
the
lawsuit
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
united
states
voted
that,
do
you
think
the
alleged
beneficiaries
all
over
the
state
could
sue
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
with
that
lawsuit
at
this
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
have
a
right
to
administer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
one
to
get
challenge.
that
there
is
no
constitutional
provision
which
will
prevent
california
from
spending
its
own
fund
in
its
own
way,
if
it
doesn't
mix
them
up
with
the
federal
receipts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
they
raise
it
under
the
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
raise
a
question
purely
under
the
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
could
sue
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
tied
up
at
all
with
the
federal
government's
position
in
connection
with
compliance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
that
lawsuit
is
based
on
quite
a
different
theory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
that's
--
any
question
has
been
raised
about
that
by
anybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
state
wants
to
participate
it
would
have
to
comply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
federal
supremacy,
all
he
can
do
is
go
pay
these
people
himself
he
can't
support
california
to
mix
up
its
fund
to
the
federal
money
and
then
according
to
the
federal
business
desires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it
can
if
it
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
merely
refuses
to
go
in
to
partnership
with
the
federal
government
on
its
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
has
a
right
to
do
so,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
where
it
has
ever
held,
where
two
litigants
have
a
controversy
among
themselves,
there
can
be
a
case
or
controversy
within
the
constitutional
sense,
when
one
of
them
has
the
right
to
settle
the
case
on
his
own
territory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
government
here
has
a
right
to
decline
that
the
state
have
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
litigant
but
it's
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
you
try
and
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
should
be
a
controversy
between
the
government
and
the
state
and
the
state
can
determine
for
itself
whether
it
accepts
the
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
that
be
a
case
of
controversy
which
calls
for
the
attention
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
trying
to
get
around
by
--
around
at
all
by
saying,
“well,
the
state
would
do
what
it
should,
we'd
get
our
money”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
doesn't
have
to
do
it.
the
state
can
decline
to
do
it
and
the
government
can
decline
to
that
amount
of
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
with
reference
to
everyone
out
there.
the
government
can
settle
it
by
not
letting
them
have
any
money.
justice
hugo

on
its
own.
why

social

justice

black
why
do
you
collect
your
money
for
social
security?
justice

black
that's
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice

black
federal

justice

this
is
an
obligation
to
a
certain
extent
on
the
part
of
the
state,
to
certain
extent
on

part
of
the
federal

under
to
be

based
on
agreement
which
they
can
reach

justice

the
controversy
here
as
to
what
the

can

what
the

can
do.
justice

the

this

us
right
