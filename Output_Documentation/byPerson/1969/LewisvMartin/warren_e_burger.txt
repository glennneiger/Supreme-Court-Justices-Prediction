mr.

you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

well,
he

be

he

--
chief

--
is

chief

e.

that's
partly
at
least
what
i
suggest
mr.

stewart
had
in
mind.
chief

warren
e.

now
before
you
do
that
mr.

what
weight
do
we
give
the
new

except
for
purposes
of
possibly
evaluating
mootness
of
the
case?
chief

warren
e.

you
do
not
challenge
it
now
--.
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
an
alternative
approach
to
it
to
and
that's
to
just
wash
the
case
up
and
let
the
litigation
resolve
itself
under
the
new
regulations
and
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
didn't
say
we
would
have
to,
i
mean
it
would
be
wise
to
do
so.
chief

usual
--
chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.
beytagh?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
mr.
beytagh
that
may
give
me
a
better
background
to
understand
some
of
the
problem
independent
that
whatever
right
the
parties
have
laying
other
side
for
the
moment.
can
you
tell
us
whether
in
a
given
situation,
if
a
state
program
under
its
statute
is
not
in
compliance
with
hew
regulations
whether
the
federal
government
may
terminate
the
grants
to
the
state
and
terminate
participation
in
the
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
produce
a
result
that
was
across
the
board
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously
result
with
a
great
deal
of
disaster
involved
in
it
but
this
is
the
hold
which
the
federal
program
has
on
each
of
the
states
basically,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
best
method
of
enforcement
of
federal
regulations
rather
than
piecemeal
litigation
by
individual
recipients?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
attempted
to
intervene,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
could
be
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
suspend
until
morning.
thank
you
mr.
beytagh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
number
829.
mr.
beytagh,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it's
complicated
somewhat
for
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
now
amended
and
the
regulations
are
amended.
and
so,
we'll
have
a
whole
new
set
of
statutes
and
regulations
to
deal
with
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
a
new
set
of
regulations
of
hew
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
new
california
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
does
the
new
statute
go
in
to
effect
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
affirmative
argument
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
how
long
do
you
think
you'd
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
grant
you
five
minutes
and
extend
accordingly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
trade
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
think
there
is
another
hypothesis
for
their
moving
out
too
and
wasn't
it
one
of
the
considerations
in
the
development
of
the
scheme
namely
that
when
they
aid
to
dependent
children
stopped,
the
free
boarder
left
because
the
income
stopped.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
didn't
--
doesn't
that
show
up
in
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
punishment
of
the
children
aspect,
i'm
talking
about
what
you
were
addressing
yourself
to
the
reasons
for
the
departure
of
this
putative
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.beytagh.
mr.linderman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
any
court
of
appeals
has
been
called
upon
to
act
under
this
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
hardly
strikes
me
as
an
ideal
way
to
litigate
a
complex
legal
questions
that
go
directly
on
no
record
from
an
administrative
determination
to
the
court
of
appeals.
at
least
in
all
the
other
administrative
reviews
by
the
court
of
appeals
there
is
a
complete
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.linderman,
i
think
you
used
the
term
that
the
assumption
was
compelled.
now,
that
assumption
also
depends
upon
the
enforceability
of
the
support
against
this
man
in
the
house.
is
that
a
safe
assumption
or
rational
assumption
that
there
is
any
real
enforceability
against
the
man
in
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how?
by
suits
against
the
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
lawyers
is
it
going
to
take
the
deal
with
the
500,000
people
on
welfare
in
los
angeles
alone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
what
is
the
ratio
of
unemployed
natural
fathers
whose
children
are
receiving
this
aid
as
compared
with
the
man
in
the
house
type
of
situation,
any
information
on
that
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
necessary
unless
someone
else
wants
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
this
assumption
that
you
are
talking
about
is
based
on
further
assumption
of
the
enforceability
against
this
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wouldn't
you
concede
that
it
is
easier
to
enforce
that
claim
against
the
natural
father
by
the
usual
traditional
processes
that
it
is
against
these
transient
men
in
the
house.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
whose
definition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
with
the
ceremonial
marriage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
that
in
appendix
to
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wanted
a
quick
easy
place
where
we
can
find
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
another
assumption.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
part
of
the
problem
or
at
least
--
or
part
of
the
problem
as
to
what
extent
leverage
may
be
used
against
the
children
to
enforce
obligations
against
the
adults?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
would
you
state
it
in
your
own
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
have
a
natural
working
father,
if
you
let
me
put
this
hypothetically
to
you,
a
natural
father
who
is
working
but
who
more
or
less
regularly
drinks
up
half
of
his
earnings.
then,
we
have
deprived
children
then
as
a
result,
can
they
get
aid
to
the
dependent
children
while
he
is
living
in
the
house
gainfully
employed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you
have
children
who
suffer
as
consequence
of
the
conduct
of
the
adults
which
is
beyond
the
reach
of
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.
linderman.
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
is
any
time

apparently,
there
is
no
time
left

you
consumed
