mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issues
in
this
welfare
case
have
become
somewhat
clouded
by
the
promulgation
of
new
state
welfare
regulations
since
the
beginning
of
the
suit
by
the
enactment
of
a
new
state
statute
since
the
decision
below
by
the
promulgation
of
proposed
regulations
under
that
state
statute
not
yet
in
effect
and
by
the
variety
of
decisions
taken
by
the
parties
and
the
amici
in
this
court.
for
this
reason,
i
think
it
useful
at
the
outset
to
describe
and
to
distinguish
several
different
factual
situations
that
is
family
situations
which
are
represented
by
the
several
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiff's
interveners
in
this
case
to
identify
the
legal
issues
presented
in
each
of
those
situations,
and
then
to
describe
what
is
and
what
is
not
still
an
issue
in
this
case.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
court
include
the
individual
plaintiffs
below,
the
individual
plaintiff
interveners
below
and
the
classes
which
they
represent.
all
of
these
persons
are
members
of
households
which
are
eligible
to
receive
or
which
claim
eligibility
to
receive
welfare
benefits
under
the
federally
supported
afdc
program
that
is
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
established
by
the
social
security
act.
in
each
case,
the
family
unit
which
is
eligible
for
such
assistance
consists
of
a
mother
and
her
natural
children.
the
children
are
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
dependent
children
because
their
natural
father
is
continually
absent
from
home.
it
is
that
circumstance
that
is
there
being
dependent
children
which
renders
them
eligible
for
assistance
if
in
addition
to
being
dependent,
they
are
also
needy
and
it
is
that
circumstance
which
requires
the
determination
of
the
extent
of
their
need
for
purposes
of
determining
their
assistance
levels.
now,
in
each
of
these
cases,
each
and
all,
california
has
taken
account
in
determining
need
of
financial
factors
relating
to
the
presence
in
the
household
of
a
man
who
is
not
the
natural
or
the
adoptive
father
of
the
dependent
children.
i
will
come
shortly
to
the
legal
basis
for
california's
action
for
the
present,
it
is
important
simply
to
know
that
the
varying
relations
of
the
male
figure
to
the
children
and
to
the
mother
create
three
distinct
factual
situations
which
have
differing
legal
import.
the
first
of
these
is
what
we
would
call
the
stepfather
situation,
and
the
stepfather
situation
is
a
case
in
which
the
man
in
the
house
is
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother.
this
is
the
case
of
a
plaintiff's
interveners,
the
bell
family
and
the
sims
family.
the
second
situation
is
what
is
in
the
jargon
known
as
the
mars
situation.
mars
is
an
acronym
for
man
assuming
the
role
of
spouse,
and
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
man
is
not
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
and
is
not
the
father
of
any
of
her
children.
the
third
situation
is
the
so
called
unmarried
father
situation.
the
unmarried
father
situation
is
a
case
in
which
the
man
is
not
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
but
he
is
the
father
of
at
least
one
of
her
children
in
the
household.
now,
that
child
would
not
be
the
afdc
eligible
child
ordinarily
because
having
both
parents
in
the
house
it
would
be
not
be
dependent.
there
are
special
programs
and
situations
in
which
he
might
be
but
for
purposes
of
these
cases,
the
afdc
child
does
not
include
that
common
child,
but
the
common
child
is
important
because
of
the
way
california
law
treats
these
cases,
the
matter
i
will
come
to
shortly.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
look
at
in
all
three
situations
though
briefly
is
how
federal
law
and
particularly
the
federal
hew
regulation
which
applies
to
this
situation
that
is
45
cfr
section
203.1
treats
these
cases.
under
federal
law,
the
three
cases
are
treated
exactly
the
same.
that
is
to
say
that
in
all
of
them,
if
there
are
any
actual
contributions
by
the
man,
the
mars,
the
stepfather,
the
unmarried
father
to
the
support
of
the
children,
to
the
upkeep
of
the
house;
that
is
considered
income
to
the
household,
what
is
known
as
the
fbu
family
budget
unit,
for
purposes
of
computing
whether
or
not
the
family
is
needy
and
the
extent
of
the
need.
however,
no
income
maybe
assumed
to
be
received
from
any
of
these
three
male
figures
for
purposes
of
determining
eligibility
as
needy
or
for
purposes
of
determining
the
extent
of
the
need.
and
this
is
so
because
under
the
relevant
federal
regulation,
income
maybe
assumed
to
be
coming
to
an
eligible
afdc
family
only,
if
it
is
coming
to
a
natural
or
adoptive
parent
of
the
afdc
children,
or
if
it
is
coming
to
a
stepparent
who
fulfills
four
criteria,
that
he
be
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother,
that
he
be
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child,
that
that
legal
obligation
be
under
a
state
law
of
general
applicability,
and
that
the
state
law
be
one
which
requires
stepparents
to
support
their
stepchildren
to
the
same
extent
that
natural
or
adoptive
parents
are
required
to
support
their
children.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
--
a
way
--
what
i'm
doing
is
to
describe
its
effect
not
yet
with
regard
to
california
law,
but
to
say
the
need
of
the
three
sets
of
situations
here.
the
hew
regulation
would
very
plainly
say
no
assumption
of
income.
now,
i'm
describing
the
terms
of
that
regulation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now,
the
result
of
course
is
that
all
of
these
three
situations
in
terms
of
assumption
in
income.
the
mars,
the
unmarried
father
not
ceremonially
married
but
the
much
more
important
aspect
which
also
applies
to
stepfathers
is
that
there
is
no
here
obligations
under
state
law
of
general
applicability
which
is
to
the
same
extent
as
the
liability
which
california
puts
for
the
support
on
the
natural
father.
i
want
to
come
back
and
take
those
requirements
report
in
detail
because
they're
the
nub
of
this
case,
but
i
want
to
pass
to
what
california
does
with
these
three
situations
to
indicate
what
i
think
is
still
a
live
issue
in
this
court.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
california
also
treated
all
three
situations
the
same.
that
is
to
say
that
in
each
and
every
case,
the
stepfather,
the
mars,
the
unmarried
father,
california
said
that,
"any
income
which
he
received
whether
or
not
he
actually
contributed
to
the
family
was
treated
as
income
to
the
family
after
certain
deductions
were
taken.
"
he
was
allowed
certain
kinds
of
deductions
spelled
out
in
state
law.
but
once
those
deductions
were
taken,
california
law
simply
assumed
that
the
rest
of
his
income
was
available
to
the
family
and
either
deducted
that
amount
from
the
need
in
order
to
reduce
the
welfare
grant
or
if
it
reduced
that
so
the
family
was
no
longer
needy
within
the
definition,
the
family
simply
became
ineligible.
now--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
no,
no.
i
may
not
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
unmarried
father
situation
only
exists
where
the
man
is
now
living
in
this
household.
if
he
is
living
in
this
household
and
has
one
child
in
common
with
the
mother
in
this
household,
then
he
is
an
unmarried
father.
now
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
effect
of
this
regulation
only
deals
if
a
man
is
in
the
house,
that's
the
whole
issue
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me
mr.
justice
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
he
did.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
he
might
be.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
had
no
such
situations
in
any
of
these
cases.
that
is
california
as
far
as
these
cases
go,
they
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
a
man
has
a
stable
relationship
in
this
one
household.
now,
i
have
some
very
real
question
as
to
whether
he
might
be
living
in
one
household
--
more
than
one
household
for
the
purposes
of
characterization.
obviously,
he
couldn't
be
more
than
one
kind
of
a
stepfather.
he's
only
ceremonially
married
to
one
woman
at
once
except
in
extreme
cases
which
we
might
conjecture.
as
far
as
the
mars
situation
goes,
i
think
he
would
not
meet
the
mars
definition
because
he
probably
couldn't
be
holding
himself
out
to
be
married,
again
and
except
the
extreme
situation
that
we
might
conjecture
in
a
way,
it
would
be
treated
as
a
mars.
the
unmarried
father
might
very
well
end
up
by
living
in
two
houses
because
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
that
he
live
there
and
that
he
has
a
child
in
the
house,
and
if
he
in
fact
splits
his
time,
then,
he
maybe
in
two
households.
we
have
no
such
situation.
now,
the
important
change
in
california
law
is
reflected
by
the
enactment
effective
november
10,
1969
of
a
new
statute
which
is
set
out
on
page
93
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
changes
the
california
rules
as
to
the
mars;
that
is
the
man
assuming
the
role
of
spouse.
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
his
income
minus
deductions
is
attributed
to
the
family.
now,
he
is
required
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
mother
relating
to
the
amount
which
he
shall
contribute
and
the
statute
requires
that
he
makes
a
contribution
which
is
no
less
than
what
it
would
cost
to
provide
himself
with
an
independent
living
arrangement.
all
of
this
is
governed
also
by
proposed
regulations.
and
then
--
the
effect
of
the
new
california
statute
is
to
attribute
to
the
family
a
proportion
of
the
amount
of
that
contribution
payment
which
he
is
required
to
maintain.
now,
let
me
describe
then
the
effect
of
this
new
statute
on
our
three
sets
of
situations.
one
as
to
the
stepfather,
absolutely
no
effect;
we
are
still
talking
at
this
point
in
time
about
section
11351
which
is
a
statute
which
this
suit
originally
challenged.
it
is
still
in
full
force
in
effect
as
to
stepfathers.
and
therefore
as
to
all
past
and
future
matters,
that
is
a
live
issue
here
with
regard
to
the
stepfather
that
is
the
plaintiff
interveners
here.
with
respect
to
them
what
we
seek
in
this
case
is
a
declaration
of
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation
under
the
statute.
a
consequent
declaration
by
this
court
of
the
illegality
because
inconsistent
with
statute
on
the
constitution
of
11351.
and
if
the
court
upholds
the
federal
regulation,
there's
an
end
of
11351
because
california
has
admitted
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
regulations.
the
court
below
so
held
and
we
think
there's
going
to
be
no
question
about
that,
and
in
fact
that
also
will
be
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
would
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
court
held
the
federal
regulation
invalid
and
therefore
allowed
california
to
enforce
its
rules.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
yes.
with
respect
to
all
parties
at
that
time.
the
new
statute
wasn't
in
effect
and
the
decision
was
made
as
to
all
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
what
was
promulgated
after
the
decision
was
made
was
not
a
new
hew
regulation,
not
a
new
state
statute.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
to
that,
there
has
been
no
determination
below
and
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
rule
on
that,
no
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
new
statute
simply
raises
the
issue
which
i'm
addressing
at
the
moment
of
what's
moot
and
what's
not.
with
regard
to
the
old
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
the
first
appendix
to--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no.
i'm
going
to
come
now
to
the
effect
of
the
new
statute
which
is
that
in
the
mars
situation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
none.
i
think
that
we
would
challenge
the
new
statute
or
i'm
about
to
say
is
i
don't
challenge
it
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
are
not
and
we
do
not
and
that's
exactly
what
i
want
to
say
that
with
regard
to
the
mars
situation,
there
is
a
question
of
mootness
as
to
future
relief.
on
the
other
hand,
the
case
is
not
moot
because
past
payments
which
are
a
law
borne
to
california
law
is
still
an
issue
up
to
date
of
a
new
statute
with
regard
even
to
the
mars
cases.
and
what
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
the
mars
statute
is
that
after
reaching
the
issues
in
this
case
which
are
required
by
the
presence
of
stepfathers
that
is
holding
the
federal
regulation
valid
and
11351
state
statutes
invalid,
simply
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
allow
the
parties
to
frame
the
issues
under
the
new
statute,
to
challenge
it
if
they
please,
see
how
the
state
regulation
solidify
and
in
effect,
equitably
clean
up
the
case
after
this
court
makes
the
major
decision
which
we
think
is
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well
this
court
would
have
to
remand
if
it
resolved
the
case
by
holding
the
federal
regulation
valid.
the
court
would
have
to
remand
for
disposition
on
a
number
of
issues.
the
amount
of
back
payments
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
it
would
be
ordinary
to
do
so
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
appropriate
in
the
sense
that
there
are
number
of
unresolved
issues
that
would
then
be
cleaned
up.
but
i
think
that
this
court
needs
are
not
entangled
itself,
is
only
what
i'm
saying
in
any
consideration
of
the
new
statute
and
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
precisely,
that
statute
should
have
no
effect
here
as
to
mootness
or
anything
else.
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that's
unclear,
that's
the
one
additional
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
regulations
under
the
new
statute
for
reasons
it
escaped
me
as
a
matter
of
the
california
law
continue
to
treat
the
unmarried
father
as
he
was
treated
under
the
old
law.
i
see
no
basis
in
california
law
for
that
and
i
think
we
just
got
to
wait
and
see
and
again,
this
is
why
it's
going
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
resolution
of
these
kinds
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
the
new
statute
changes
the
entire
method
of
california's
treatment
of
income
in
those
cases
as
it
no
longer
is
the
case
that
the
income
to
the
male
is
treated
as
income
to
the
family
unit
after
deduction.
now,
there
is
a
new
requirement
which
is
that
he
make
a
contribution
which
is
described
in
detail,
it
has
to
be
the
same
then
he
would
make
the
support
himself
independently
to
the
families
and
a
percentage
of
that
is
treated
as
income.
we
don't
really
know
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
there
may
or
there
may
not
be
but
until
we
know
what
the
new
state
proposed
regulation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it's
not
here
now
because
we
just
don't
know.
it's
simply
is
not
right
as
the
answer
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
have
both
the
new
statute
in
the
brief
and
that
in
the
last
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
discussion
of
the
effect
of
it,
yes.
but
not
for
the
purpose
having
this
court
decide.
now,
coming
briefly
to
two
sets
of
questions
of
letting
in
the
federal
regulation
and
the
constitutional
issues,
i
propose
to
start
with
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation.
i
think
that
that
is
not
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
below,
very
difficult
question.
let's
take
a
look
at
what
this
regulation
does
and
does
not
do.
it
does
not
restrict
in
anyway
state
power
to
decide
how
much
income
a
family
has
to
have
or
lack
before
they
are
needy.
in
that
sense,
the
determination
of
need
is
left
to
the
state
that
what
is
needy.
it
doesn't
restrict
in
anyway
state
power
to
limit
how
much
of
a
family's
need
the
state
is
going
to
supply.
as
far
as
this
regulation
goes
maximum
grants
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
unaffected.
moreover,
it
does
not
restrict
in
anyways,
state
power
to
determine
how
much
income
or
resources
an
afdc
family
has
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it's
needy.
insofar
as
it
weighs
the
actual
income
received,
if
any
actual
income
is
received,
the
federal
regulation
allows
the
state
to
treat
it
as
income
to
the
family.
what
it
does
do
is
to
deny
the
state,
to
treat
as
income
and
as
its
resources.
moneys
which
are
not
proved
to
be
actually
available
to
the
afdc
family
except
under
specified
conditions
which
are
designed
to
assure
that
the
situation
is
one
in
which
even
without
proof
of
actual
availability
of
money.
meaningful
economic
protection
of
the
afdc
child
is
support.
now,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
specific
regulation
in
a
moment
but
a
vitally
important
part
of
this
case
is
that
this
particular
regulation,
the
hew
regulation
is
only
one
sub
species,
a
particularized
aspect
of
a
more
general
hew
regulatory
policy.
since
1967,
hew
has
provided
that
only
income
and
resources
that
are
in
fact
available
to
an
applicant
or
a
recipient
for
current
use
on
a
regular
basis
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
need
and
the
amount
of
payment.
and
for
example,
hew
says
that
in
a
case
where
a
child
has
a
support
obligation
under
a
court
order
from
the
father
that
the
state
may
not
free
as
income,
the
amount
which
the
court
has
ordered
to
pay,
unless
it's
actually
paid.
now,
the
importance
of
that
in
this
case
is
that
the
ground
of
california's
position
here
and
the
district
courts
decision
below
doesn't
just
knock
out
this
hew
regulation.
it
would
knock
out
every
hew
regulation
which
announces
the
general
or
specific
policies
of
non-assumption
of
income
because
what
california
says
it
has
a
right
to
do
is
to
treat
as
an
income
to
the
afdc
family,
any
and
every
legal
obligation
created
by
state
law
without
proof
of
actual
receipt.
now,
hew
has
found
over
the
course
of
many
years
of
administering
this
program,
if
there's
one
thing
that
have
a
bird
in
a
bush
and
i
would
have
a
bird
in
a
hand
as
far
as
an
afdc
family
goes.
there
are
lots
of
legal
obligations
that
just
don't
come
off
and
don't
come
through,
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
hew
regulation
to
assure
that
except
in
a
vividly
class
of
cases
where
one
can
be
very
sure
that
legal
obligations
are
in
fact
likely
to
come
through,
that
states
are
not
going
to
be
permitted
to
assume
income.
now,
we
think
that
the
position
of
the
court
below
in
california
is
wrong.
insofar
as
they
purport
absolutely
to
preclude
hew
from
limiting
state
power
to
treat
non-received
theoretically
available
resources
as
income
to
the
family.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
precisely
because
it
requires
the
hew
to
approve
state
plans
which
are
required
to
provide
for
a
consideration
of
income
and
resources,
plus
hew
to
decide
what
kind
of
income
and
resources
are
meant
by
that
and
if
hew
reasonably
sets
restrictions
on
what
the
state
can
assume
in
the
way
of
income,
those
restrictions
are
valid.
here
in
light
of
the
shortness
of
time,
i
mean
to
refer
to
only
two
of
the
restrictions
and
show
how
obviously
consistent
with
statute
they
are.
hew
following
king
v.
smith
required
that,
before
income
be
assumed,
state
law
imposed
a
legal
obligation,
and
that
the
legal
obligation
being
a
general
one,
that
is
under
a
state
statute
of
general
applicability
and
the
same
as
the
father.
some
just
start
with
the
same
as
the
fathers.
under
california
law
as
under
mars
law,
father's
obligation
is
not
defeasible
if
the
father
leaves
the
home.
he
can
be
pursued
and
be
required
to
support
his
child
anytime,
anywhere.
the
obligation
imposed
by
this
particular
california
law
exists
so
long
and
only
so
long
as
in
the
man
is
in
the
home,
and
that's
true
with
regard
to
stepfather,
mars
and
everybody.
as
soon
as
he
leaves
the
house,
the
right
ceases.
now,
of
course
hew
could
require
that
california
assure
something
like
a
parental
obligation
to
support
and
not
the
half
baked
right
that
california
has
given
children
in
the
situations
presented
in
this
case
because
california
--
hew
cannon
says
must
give
them
a
full
fledged
right,
one
which
is
not
useless
simply
because
if
a
mother
threatens
to
enforce
it,
the
man
leaves
and
there's
an
end
of
the
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
government
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
one
of
the
issues
--
with
more
time
i
might
have
tried
to
clarify
somewhat
more.
we
don't
take
that
position
and
candidly
it's
for
this
reason.
you've
got
three
california
judges
below,
the
california
district
court;
they
said
it
was
an
enforceable
obligation.
there
is
no
california
law
one
way
or
the
other
that
square
on
it.
there
is
a
recent
case
that
is
cited
in
the
california's
brief
that
i
might
give
the
court
a
full
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
fine,
and
we
need
only
relayed
and
not
got
this
regulation
on
the
proposition
that
the
duty
of
support
is
not
the
same
and
it's
not
under
a
generally
applicable
statute,
an
additional
reason
why
the
secretary
could
insist
that
the
obligation
be
the
same
is
fairly
evident
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
is
an
affirmative
purpose
of
this
statute
to
keep
families
together.
if
california
is
permitted
to
put
in
a
regulation
which
says
that
“income
is
to
be
assumed
because
a
man
is
required
to
support
children
only
when
he's
in
the
home”
the
effect
of
that
is
to
drive
him
out
of
the
home.
in
two
of
these
cases
that's
what
exactly
happened.
now
to
prevent
this
result
and
to
assure
economic
security,
hew,
it
is
our
position
could
properly
promulgate
this
regulation
it
is
valid
and
accordingly
the
state
statute
inconsistent
with
it
is
invalid.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issues
in
this
welfare
case
have
become
somewhat
clouded
by
the
promulgation
of
new
state
welfare
regulations
since
the
beginning
of
the
suit
by
the
enactment
of
a
new
state
statute
since
the
decision
below
by
the
promulgation
of
proposed
regulations
under
that
state
statute
not
yet
in
effect
and
by
the
variety
of
decisions
taken
by
the
parties
and
the
amici
in
this
court.
for
this
reason,
i
think
it
useful
at
the
outset
to
describe
and
to
distinguish
several
different
factual
situations
that
is
family
situations
which
are
represented
by
the
several
plaintiffs
and
the
plaintiff's
interveners
in
this
case
to
identify
the
legal
issues
presented
in
each
of
those
situations,
and
then
to
describe
what
is
and
what
is
not
still
an
issue
in
this
case.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
court
include
the
individual
plaintiffs
below,
the
individual
plaintiff
interveners
below
and
the
classes
which
they
represent.
all
of
these
persons
are
members
of
households
which
are
eligible
to
receive
or
which
claim
eligibility
to
receive
welfare
benefits
under
the
federally
supported
afdc
program
that
is
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
established
by
the
social
security
act.
in
each
case,
the
family
unit
which
is
eligible
for
such
assistance
consists
of
a
mother
and
her
natural
children.
the
children
are
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
dependent
children
because
their
natural
father
is
continually
absent
from
home.
it
is
that
circumstance
that
is
there
being
dependent
children
which
renders
them
eligible
for
assistance
if
in
addition
to
being
dependent,
they
are
also
needy
and
it
is
that
circumstance
which
requires
the
determination
of
the
extent
of
their
need
for
purposes
of
determining
their
assistance
levels.
now,
in
each
of
these
cases,
each
and
all,
california
has
taken
account
in
determining
need
of
financial
factors
relating
to
the
presence
in
the
household
of
a
man
who
is
not
the
natural
or
the
adoptive
father
of
the
dependent
children.
i
will
come
shortly
to
the
legal
basis
for
california's
action
for
the
present,
it
is
important
simply
to
know
that
the
varying
relations
of
the
male
figure
to
the
children
and
to
the
mother
create
three
distinct
factual
situations
which
have
differing
legal
import.
the
first
of
these
is
what
we
would
call
the
stepfather
situation,
and
the
stepfather
situation
is
a
case
in
which
the
man
in
the
house
is
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother.
this
is
the
case
of
a
plaintiff's
interveners,
the
bell
family
and
the
sims
family.
the
second
situation
is
what
is
in
the
jargon
known
as
the
mars
situation.
mars
is
an
acronym
for
man
assuming
the
role
of
spouse,
and
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
man
is
not
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
and
is
not
the
father
of
any
of
her
children.
the
third
situation
is
the
so
called
unmarried
father
situation.
the
unmarried
father
situation
is
a
case
in
which
the
man
is
not
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
but
he
is
the
father
of
at
least
one
of
her
children
in
the
household.
now,
that
child
would
not
be
the
afdc
eligible
child
ordinarily
because
having
both
parents
in
the
house
it
would
be
not
be
dependent.
there
are
special
programs
and
situations
in
which
he
might
be
but
for
purposes
of
these
cases,
the
afdc
child
does
not
include
that
common
child,
but
the
common
child
is
important
because
of
the
way
california
law
treats
these
cases,
the
matter
i
will
come
to
shortly.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
look
at
in
all
three
situations
though
briefly
is
how
federal
law
and
particularly
the
federal
hew
regulation
which
applies
to
this
situation
that
is
45
cfr
section
203.1
treats
these
cases.
under
federal
law,
the
three
cases
are
treated
exactly
the
same.
that
is
to
say
that
in
all
of
them,
if
there
are
any
actual
contributions
by
the
man,
the
mars,
the
stepfather,
the
unmarried
father
to
the
support
of
the
children,
to
the
upkeep
of
the
house;
that
is
considered
income
to
the
household,
what
is
known
as
the
fbu
family
budget
unit,
for
purposes
of
computing
whether
or
not
the
family
is
needy
and
the
extent
of
the
need.
however,
no
income
maybe
assumed
to
be
received
from
any
of
these
three
male
figures
for
purposes
of
determining
eligibility
as
needy
or
for
purposes
of
determining
the
extent
of
the
need.
and
this
is
so
because
under
the
relevant
federal
regulation,
income
maybe
assumed
to
be
coming
to
an
eligible
afdc
family
only,
if
it
is
coming
to
a
natural
or
adoptive
parent
of
the
afdc
children,
or
if
it
is
coming
to
a
stepparent
who
fulfills
four
criteria,
that
he
be
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother,
that
he
be
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child,
that
that
legal
obligation
be
under
a
state
law
of
general
applicability,
and
that
the
state
law
be
one
which
requires
stepparents
to
support
their
stepchildren
to
the
same
extent
that
natural
or
adoptive
parents
are
required
to
support
their
children.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
--
a
way
--
what
i'm
doing
is
to
describe
its
effect
not
yet
with
regard
to
california
law,
but
to
say
the
need
of
the
three
sets
of
situations
here.
the
hew
regulation
would
very
plainly
say
no
assumption
of
income.
now,
i'm
describing
the
terms
of
that
regulation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now,
the
result
of
course
is
that
all
of
these
three
situations
in
terms
of
assumption
in
income.
the
mars,
the
unmarried
father
not
ceremonially
married
but
the
much
more
important
aspect
which
also
applies
to
stepfathers
is
that
there
is
no
here
obligations
under
state
law
of
general
applicability
which
is
to
the
same
extent
as
the
liability
which
california
puts
for
the
support
on
the
natural
father.
i
want
to
come
back
and
take
those
requirements
report
in
detail
because
they're
the
nub
of
this
case,
but
i
want
to
pass
to
what
california
does
with
these
three
situations
to
indicate
what
i
think
is
still
a
live
issue
in
this
court.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
california
also
treated
all
three
situations
the
same.
that
is
to
say
that
in
each
and
every
case,
the
stepfather,
the
mars,
the
unmarried
father,
california
said
that,
"any
income
which
he
received
whether
or
not
he
actually
contributed
to
the
family
was
treated
as
income
to
the
family
after
certain
deductions
were
taken.
"
he
was
allowed
certain
kinds
of
deductions
spelled
out
in
state
law.
but
once
those
deductions
were
taken,
california
law
simply
assumed
that
the
rest
of
his
income
was
available
to
the
family
and
either
deducted
that
amount
from
the
need
in
order
to
reduce
the
welfare
grant
or
if
it
reduced
that
so
the
family
was
no
longer
needy
within
the
definition,
the
family
simply
became
ineligible.
now--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
no,
no.
i
may
not
understand
the
question
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
unmarried
father
situation
only
exists
where
the
man
is
now
living
in
this
household.
if
he
is
living
in
this
household
and
has
one
child
in
common
with
the
mother
in
this
household,
then
he
is
an
unmarried
father.
now
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
effect
of
this
regulation
only
deals
if
a
man
is
in
the
house,
that's
the
whole
issue
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me
mr.
justice
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
he
did.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
he
might
be.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
had
no
such
situations
in
any
of
these
cases.
that
is
california
as
far
as
these
cases
go,
they
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
a
man
has
a
stable
relationship
in
this
one
household.
now,
i
have
some
very
real
question
as
to
whether
he
might
be
living
in
one
household
--
more
than
one
household
for
the
purposes
of
characterization.
obviously,
he
couldn't
be
more
than
one
kind
of
a
stepfather.
he's
only
ceremonially
married
to
one
woman
at
once
except
in
extreme
cases
which
we
might
conjecture.
as
far
as
the
mars
situation
goes,
i
think
he
would
not
meet
the
mars
definition
because
he
probably
couldn't
be
holding
himself
out
to
be
married,
again
and
except
the
extreme
situation
that
we
might
conjecture
in
a
way,
it
would
be
treated
as
a
mars.
the
unmarried
father
might
very
well
end
up
by
living
in
two
houses
because
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
that
he
live
there
and
that
he
has
a
child
in
the
house,
and
if
he
in
fact
splits
his
time,
then,
he
maybe
in
two
households.
we
have
no
such
situation.
now,
the
important
change
in
california
law
is
reflected
by
the
enactment
effective
november
10,
1969
of
a
new
statute
which
is
set
out
on
page
93
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
changes
the
california
rules
as
to
the
mars;
that
is
the
man
assuming
the
role
of
spouse.
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
his
income
minus
deductions
is
attributed
to
the
family.
now,
he
is
required
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
mother
relating
to
the
amount
which
he
shall
contribute
and
the
statute
requires
that
he
makes
a
contribution
which
is
no
less
than
what
it
would
cost
to
provide
himself
with
an
independent
living
arrangement.
all
of
this
is
governed
also
by
proposed
regulations.
and
then
--
the
effect
of
the
new
california
statute
is
to
attribute
to
the
family
a
proportion
of
the
amount
of
that
contribution
payment
which
he
is
required
to
maintain.
now,
let
me
describe
then
the
effect
of
this
new
statute
on
our
three
sets
of
situations.
one
as
to
the
stepfather,
absolutely
no
effect;
we
are
still
talking
at
this
point
in
time
about
section
11351
which
is
a
statute
which
this
suit
originally
challenged.
it
is
still
in
full
force
in
effect
as
to
stepfathers.
and
therefore
as
to
all
past
and
future
matters,
that
is
a
live
issue
here
with
regard
to
the
stepfather
that
is
the
plaintiff
interveners
here.
with
respect
to
them
what
we
seek
in
this
case
is
a
declaration
of
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation
under
the
statute.
a
consequent
declaration
by
this
court
of
the
illegality
because
inconsistent
with
statute
on
the
constitution
of
11351.
and
if
the
court
upholds
the
federal
regulation,
there's
an
end
of
11351
because
california
has
admitted
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
regulations.
the
court
below
so
held
and
we
think
there's
going
to
be
no
question
about
that,
and
in
fact
that
also
will
be
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
would
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
court
held
the
federal
regulation
invalid
and
therefore
allowed
california
to
enforce
its
rules.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
yes.
with
respect
to
all
parties
at
that
time.
the
new
statute
wasn't
in
effect
and
the
decision
was
made
as
to
all
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
what
was
promulgated
after
the
decision
was
made
was
not
a
new
hew
regulation,
not
a
new
state
statute.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
to
that,
there
has
been
no
determination
below
and
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
rule
on
that,
no
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
new
statute
simply
raises
the
issue
which
i'm
addressing
at
the
moment
of
what's
moot
and
what's
not.
with
regard
to
the
old
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
the
first
appendix
to--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no.
i'm
going
to
come
now
to
the
effect
of
the
new
statute
which
is
that
in
the
mars
situation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely
none.
i
think
that
we
would
challenge
the
new
statute
or
i'm
about
to
say
is
i
don't
challenge
it
here.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
are
not
and
we
do
not
and
that's
exactly
what
i
want
to
say
that
with
regard
to
the
mars
situation,
there
is
a
question
of
mootness
as
to
future
relief.
on
the
other
hand,
the
case
is
not
moot
because
past
payments
which
are
a
law
borne
to
california
law
is
still
an
issue
up
to
date
of
a
new
statute
with
regard
even
to
the
mars
cases.
and
what
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
the
mars
statute
is
that
after
reaching
the
issues
in
this
case
which
are
required
by
the
presence
of
stepfathers
that
is
holding
the
federal
regulation
valid
and
11351
state
statutes
invalid,
simply
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
allow
the
parties
to
frame
the
issues
under
the
new
statute,
to
challenge
it
if
they
please,
see
how
the
state
regulation
solidify
and
in
effect,
equitably
clean
up
the
case
after
this
court
makes
the
major
decision
which
we
think
is
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well
this
court
would
have
to
remand
if
it
resolved
the
case
by
holding
the
federal
regulation
valid.
the
court
would
have
to
remand
for
disposition
on
a
number
of
issues.
the
amount
of
back
payments
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
it
would
be
ordinary
to
do
so
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
appropriate
in
the
sense
that
there
are
number
of
unresolved
issues
that
would
then
be
cleaned
up.
but
i
think
that
this
court
needs
are
not
entangled
itself,
is
only
what
i'm
saying
in
any
consideration
of
the
new
statute
and
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
precisely,
that
statute
should
have
no
effect
here
as
to
mootness
or
anything
else.
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
that's
unclear,
that's
the
one
additional
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
regulations
under
the
new
statute
for
reasons
it
escaped
me
as
a
matter
of
the
california
law
continue
to
treat
the
unmarried
father
as
he
was
treated
under
the
old
law.
i
see
no
basis
in
california
law
for
that
and
i
think
we
just
got
to
wait
and
see
and
again,
this
is
why
it's
going
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
resolution
of
these
kinds
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
the
new
statute
changes
the
entire
method
of
california's
treatment
of
income
in
those
cases
as
it
no
longer
is
the
case
that
the
income
to
the
male
is
treated
as
income
to
the
family
unit
after
deduction.
now,
there
is
a
new
requirement
which
is
that
he
make
a
contribution
which
is
described
in
detail,
it
has
to
be
the
same
then
he
would
make
the
support
himself
independently
to
the
families
and
a
percentage
of
that
is
treated
as
income.
we
don't
really
know
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
there
may
or
there
may
not
be
but
until
we
know
what
the
new
state
proposed
regulation
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it's
not
here
now
because
we
just
don't
know.
it's
simply
is
not
right
as
the
answer
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
have
both
the
new
statute
in
the
brief
and
that
in
the
last
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
discussion
of
the
effect
of
it,
yes.
but
not
for
the
purpose
having
this
court
decide.
now,
coming
briefly
to
two
sets
of
questions
of
letting
in
the
federal
regulation
and
the
constitutional
issues,
i
propose
to
start
with
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation.
i
think
that
that
is
not
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
below,
very
difficult
question.
let's
take
a
look
at
what
this
regulation
does
and
does
not
do.
it
does
not
restrict
in
anyway
state
power
to
decide
how
much
income
a
family
has
to
have
or
lack
before
they
are
needy.
in
that
sense,
the
determination
of
need
is
left
to
the
state
that
what
is
needy.
it
doesn't
restrict
in
anyway
state
power
to
limit
how
much
of
a
family's
need
the
state
is
going
to
supply.
as
far
as
this
regulation
goes
maximum
grants
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
unaffected.
moreover,
it
does
not
restrict
in
anyways,
state
power
to
determine
how
much
income
or
resources
an
afdc
family
has
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
it's
needy.
insofar
as
it
weighs
the
actual
income
received,
if
any
actual
income
is
received,
the
federal
regulation
allows
the
state
to
treat
it
as
income
to
the
family.
what
it
does
do
is
to
deny
the
state,
to
treat
as
income
and
as
its
resources.
moneys
which
are
not
proved
to
be
actually
available
to
the
afdc
family
except
under
specified
conditions
which
are
designed
to
assure
that
the
situation
is
one
in
which
even
without
proof
of
actual
availability
of
money.
meaningful
economic
protection
of
the
afdc
child
is
support.
now,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
specific
regulation
in
a
moment
but
a
vitally
important
part
of
this
case
is
that
this
particular
regulation,
the
hew
regulation
is
only
one
sub
species,
a
particularized
aspect
of
a
more
general
hew
regulatory
policy.
since
1967,
hew
has
provided
that
only
income
and
resources
that
are
in
fact
available
to
an
applicant
or
a
recipient
for
current
use
on
a
regular
basis
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
need
and
the
amount
of
payment.
and
for
example,
hew
says
that
in
a
case
where
a
child
has
a
support
obligation
under
a
court
order
from
the
father
that
the
state
may
not
free
as
income,
the
amount
which
the
court
has
ordered
to
pay,
unless
it's
actually
paid.
now,
the
importance
of
that
in
this
case
is
that
the
ground
of
california's
position
here
and
the
district
courts
decision
below
doesn't
just
knock
out
this
hew
regulation.
it
would
knock
out
every
hew
regulation
which
announces
the
general
or
specific
policies
of
non-assumption
of
income
because
what
california
says
it
has
a
right
to
do
is
to
treat
as
an
income
to
the
afdc
family,
any
and
every
legal
obligation
created
by
state
law
without
proof
of
actual
receipt.
now,
hew
has
found
over
the
course
of
many
years
of
administering
this
program,
if
there's
one
thing
that
have
a
bird
in
a
bush
and
i
would
have
a
bird
in
a
hand
as
far
as
an
afdc
family
goes.
there
are
lots
of
legal
obligations
that
just
don't
come
off
and
don't
come
through,
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
hew
regulation
to
assure
that
except
in
a
vividly
class
of
cases
where
one
can
be
very
sure
that
legal
obligations
are
in
fact
likely
to
come
through,
that
states
are
not
going
to
be
permitted
to
assume
income.
now,
we
think
that
the
position
of
the
court
below
in
california
is
wrong.
insofar
as
they
purport
absolutely
to
preclude
hew
from
limiting
state
power
to
treat
non-received
theoretically
available
resources
as
income
to
the
family.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
precisely
because
it
requires
the
hew
to
approve
state
plans
which
are
required
to
provide
for
a
consideration
of
income
and
resources,
plus
hew
to
decide
what
kind
of
income
and
resources
are
meant
by
that
and
if
hew
reasonably
sets
restrictions
on
what
the
state
can
assume
in
the
way
of
income,
those
restrictions
are
valid.
here
in
light
of
the
shortness
of
time,
i
mean
to
refer
to
only
two
of
the
restrictions
and
show
how
obviously
consistent
with
statute
they
are.
hew
following
king
v.
smith
required
that,
before
income
be
assumed,
state
law
imposed
a
legal
obligation,
and
that
the
legal
obligation
being
a
general
one,
that
is
under
a
state
statute
of
general
applicability
and
the
same
as
the
father.
some
just
start
with
the
same
as
the
fathers.
under
california
law
as
under
mars
law,
father's
obligation
is
not
defeasible
if
the
father
leaves
the
home.
he
can
be
pursued
and
be
required
to
support
his
child
anytime,
anywhere.
the
obligation
imposed
by
this
particular
california
law
exists
so
long
and
only
so
long
as
in
the
man
is
in
the
home,
and
that's
true
with
regard
to
stepfather,
mars
and
everybody.
as
soon
as
he
leaves
the
house,
the
right
ceases.
now,
of
course
hew
could
require
that
california
assure
something
like
a
parental
obligation
to
support
and
not
the
half
baked
right
that
california
has
given
children
in
the
situations
presented
in
this
case
because
california
--
hew
cannon
says
must
give
them
a
full
fledged
right,
one
which
is
not
useless
simply
because
if
a
mother
threatens
to
enforce
it,
the
man
leaves
and
there's
an
end
of
the
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
government
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
one
of
the
issues
--
with
more
time
i
might
have
tried
to
clarify
somewhat
more.
we
don't
take
that
position
and
candidly
it's
for
this
reason.
you've
got
three
california
judges
below,
the
california
district
court;
they
said
it
was
an
enforceable
obligation.
there
is
no
california
law
one
way
or
the
other
that
square
on
it.
there
is
a
recent
case
that
is
cited
in
the
california's
brief
that
i
might
give
the
court
a
full
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
fine,
and
we
need
only
relayed
and
not
got
this
regulation
on
the
proposition
that
the
duty
of
support
is
not
the
same
and
it's
not
under
a
generally
applicable
statute,
an
additional
reason
why
the
secretary
could
insist
that
the
obligation
be
the
same
is
fairly
evident
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
is
an
affirmative
purpose
of
this
statute
to
keep
families
together.
if
california
is
permitted
to
put
in
a
regulation
which
says
that
“income
is
to
be
assumed
because
a
man
is
required
to
support
children
only
when
he's
in
the
home”
the
effect
of
that
is
to
drive
him
out
of
the
home.
in
two
of
these
cases
that's
what
exactly
happened.
now
to
prevent
this
result
and
to
assure
economic
security,
hew,
it
is
our
position
could
properly
promulgate
this
regulation
it
is
valid
and
accordingly
the
state
statute
inconsistent
with
it
is
invalid.
thank
you.
