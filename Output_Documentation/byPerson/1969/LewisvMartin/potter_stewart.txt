justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
you've
just
been
describing
the
hew
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
you
would
be
describing,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
just
so
i
can
understand
california's
view
on
this,
if
an
unmarried
father
were
living
as
the
husband
of
another
woman
and
with
eleven
children
of
theirs,
if
he
were
an
unmarried
father
of
a
child
in
an
afdc
household
with
another
mother
and
one
child
of
that
family,
he
would
--
his
income
would
be
attributable
to
that
second
unit?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
it's
only
applicable
if
he's
living
in
the
household?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
a
bit
confused
too.
do
i
understand
that
the
new
legislation,
your
position
is
has
no
bearing
whatever
in
the
stepfather
situation
that's
precisely
as
it
was
when
the
case
was
brought
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
that
presents
the
question,
the
basic
question
of
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation
held
invalid
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
the
validity
of
the
state
regulations
or
statute
as
the
case
maybe,
but
only
in
the
stepfather
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well
are
you
going
to
tell
us,
you've
already
told
us
that
the
stepfather
situation,
we
needn't
be
concerned
with
the
new
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
what
is
in
the
mars
situation
and
the
unmarried
father
situation
that
the
new
statute
says
that
makes
doubtful
whether
those
cases
are
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
because
of
this
change
i
gather,
there
could
be
no
conflict
with
the
federal
regulation
if
the
federal
regulation
is
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
we
needn't
deal
with
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
suppose
the
thrust
of
these
various
questions
is
that
the
effect
that
the
effect
that
this
litigation
may
be
premature
that
not
until
or
unless
the
secretary
of
hew
cuts
off
funds
to
california
on
the
basis
of
his
regulation,
would
that
regulation
or
of
its
validity
become
a
litigable
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
harsh
approach
as
contrary
to
king
against
smith,
but
certainly
there's
a
great
deal
of
logic
in
it
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you
wouldn't
force
him
if
he
wants
to
continue
to
pay
out
the
money,
then
he
is
just
not
relying
on
his
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
up
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
very
strange
thing.
this,
in
no
way
does
this
california
regulation
violate
federal
law
but
constitutional
question
aside,
equal
protection
question
aside.
it
simply
violates
it's
alleged
a
condition
on
the
payment
of
federal
money.
it
doesn't
violate
anything
in
the
supremacy
clause
or
any
preemptive
thing.
it's
just
a
condition
that
it
has
to
meet
to
receive
federal
largess.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
federal
regulation,
so
i
understand
it,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
california
to
prove
or
to
show
or
to
ascertain
to
its
own
satisfaction
perhaps,
how
much
in
fact
your
stepfather
or
the
man
assuming
the
role
of
spouse
actually
does
contribute.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
attribution
of
support
by
what
[voice
overlap].
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
this
might
vary
from
months
to
months
and
even
from
week
to
week
or
even
from
day
to
day.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
do
they
deal
with
the
fact
this
maybe
a
changing
pattern?
i
mean,
the
stepfather
may
have
all
good
intentions
and
one
month
might
contribute,
the
next
month
he
might
stop
at
bar
and
grill
and
drink
up
or
gamble
away
all
the
money
and
not
contribute
that
month.
what
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think,
he
would
followed
from
what
california
has
done
that
the
family
would
not
be
eligible
for
afdc
grants
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it
would
be
the
same
as
the
situation
in
king
and
smith.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
families
are
eligible
only
if
one
parent
is
dead
or
absent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
makes
the
family
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correspondence
in
the
appendix
here?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
in
the
whole
record
that's
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
have
statutory
citation
to
this
review
procedure
to
which
you
refer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
actually
that
could
be
done,
couldn't
it
in
quite
a
different
way
if
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states
of
america
cutoff
a
lot
in
california
because
you
were
not
in
compliance
with
the
conditions
under
which
those
funds
are
made
available
under
these
categorical
existence
program.
california
could
then
sue
the
united
states
of
america
in
this
court
as
a
nisi
prius
court,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
only
the
constitutional
restrictions.
justice
potter
stewart
absolutely
and
that
same
argument
would
be
made
whether
or
not
to
any
federal
funds.
justice
potter
stewart
at
all
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
the
amount
of
money,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
eligibility
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
with
some
if
you
have
a
chance
but
generally
speaking
if
both
parents
are
in
the
house
ineligibility.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right
then
you
are
violating
the
federal
law
in
a
different
way
because
you're
spending
federal
money
that
you're
not
authorized
to
spend
because
you're
giving
it
to
children
who
are
ineligible
under
the
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
say
if
you
do
that,
then
if
you
give
any
money
to
a
family
of
the
stepfather
then
you're
making
an
unauthorized
expenditure
of
federal
money
and
you're
violating
the
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
specific
language?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
income
and
resources.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
are
saying
that
the
emphasis
of
that
act
have
a
regulation
says
that
income
and
sources
are
not
going
to
be
assumed.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
statute
requires
that
you
assume
that
was
social
security?
justice
potter
stewart
california
does
have
a
maximum
grant
regulation,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
have
--
if
you
work
out
a
standard
of
need
of
your
system
and
it
varies
as
far
as
not
with
the
kind
of
living,
with
the
kind
of
shelter
that
they
have?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
but
with
a
maximum
per
family
unit?
justice
potter
stewart
--is
violative
of
the
federal
statute
and
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
am
i

it's
