mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
the
beginning
to
indicate
that
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
the
new
california
statute
and
question
of
mootness
is
as
stated
by
mr.
amsterdam,
we
feel
the
case
is
not
moot.
the
essential
questions
presented
to
the
court
when
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
california
statute
are
still
here,
those
basic
questions
relate
to
the
validity
of
the
hew
regulation.
we
agree
as
well
that
the
most
appropriate
course
would
be
for
the
court
as
to
the
effect
of
the
new
california
statute
assuming
the
reversal
of
the
decision
below
to
remand
it
to
the
lower
court
for
the
proceedings
to
determine
just
what
that
particular
statute
means
as
to
those
situations
affected
by
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
the
federal
government
can
do
that,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
a
result
that
of
course
is
not
one
which
is
desired
either
by
the
federal
government
or
i
would
think
by
the
state.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
one
way
to
express
it,
yes
your
honor.
the
statute
clearly
sets
out
the
responsibilities
of
the
secretary
and
one
of
those
responsibilities
is
to
pass
on
state
plans
and
very
elaborate
scheme
is
set
out
for
the
state
plans
and
what
they
should
entail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
may
well
be
a
better
means
of
effectuating
that.
however,
the
situation
that
we
have
here
as
the
court
well
knows
came
out
of
its
decision
king
versus
smith
prior
to
that
time,
hew
had
not
felt
itself
in
a
position
to
enforce
rigidly
on
the
states,
the
rules
that
it
had
promulgated
bolstered
by
king
versus
smith,
the
alabama
substitute
father
case,
hew
has
now
sought
to
enforce
those
regulations
in
this
case
of
course
came
along
at
this
time.
we
attempted
to
intervene
below
and
we
were
not
permitted
to
do
so
and
therefore
we
are
appearing
in
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
only
consequence
--
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
secretary
would
have
the
option
of
terminating
a
program
as
to
california,
in
fact
do
that
or
not
i
don't
know
because
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
because
there's
so
a
reconcilable
and
necessarily
in
conflict
that
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
but
the
secretary
is
authorized
by
provisions
of
the
act
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
to
implement
it.
he
has
done
this
in
promulgating
this
regulation
that
we
have
before
us
now,
and
i
think
the
district
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
does
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
it
seems
to
me
all
that
it
results
in
is
that
california
must
have
a
program
as
some
40
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
then,
they
don't
have
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
the
hew
regulation
is
held
valid
by
this
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
then
the
california
statute
is
necessarily
invalid
since
it's
inconsistent
that
way
--now
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
but
the
likelihood
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
just
as
in
the
alabama
case,
alabama
after
king
versus
smith
could
have
i
suppose
said
that
it
no
longer
wanted
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
federal
program
and
gone
off
and
continued
to
have
its
substitute
father
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
true,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
thing
in
context.
the
california
statute
is
written
specifically
to
apply
only
in
federal
afdc
program
cases.
it
was
obviously
designed
for
that
purpose,
that's
the
only
situation
in
which
it
applies.
now,
california
if
it
didn't
like
the
hew
regulation
could
obviously
draft
another
statute
entirely
unrelated
to
the
federal
program
for
welfare
assistance,
but
i
think
the
practical
likelihood
of
that
happening
is
very
remote.
the
federal
assistance
here
is
substantial
as
your
honor
knows
and
i
think
that
the
state
simply
couldn't
function
anywhere
near
a
reasonable
level
that
it
didn't
have
a
federal
matching
assistance.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
a
program
of
assistance.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
quite
appropriate
to
determine
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
--
or
at
least
that
the
secretary
has
the
option
of
cutting
them
off
for
failure
to
comply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
the
act
requires
that
the
state
be
in
compliance
with
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation
promulgated
by
hew
which
provides
in
substance
that
only
actual
support
payments,
the
actual
contributions
made
to
afdc
families
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
level
of
need
as
mr.
amsterdam
has
indicated.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
a
rather
harsh
approach
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there's
some
logic
in
it
but
in
the
meantime,
you
would
have
to
force
the
secretary
to
terminate
a
program
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
then,
there's
no
way
--
there's
no
way
that
then
the
secretary
could
get
the
validity
of
his
regulation
litigated.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
secretary
doesn't
think
that's
alright
and
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think
he
should
have
to.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honors
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
this
legislation
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
we
agree
that
it
has
a
right
to
do
so
but
as
to
the
question
of
rightness,
it
seems
to
me
that
forcing
the
federal
government
to
cut
off
the
funds
to
a
state
that
does
not
want
to
comply
with
what
hew
feels
is
a
reasonable
regulation
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
act,
the
secretary
is
charged
with
administering,
is
not
a
desirable
way
to
go
about
handling
this
matter
and
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
decided
that
in
king
versus
smith.
i
see
that
the
red
light
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
substance
of
the
position
of
the
government
which
in
essence
says
that
the
court
below
improperly
determined
that
that
the
hew
regulation
in
question
here
conflicted
with
the
statute.
if
time
permits,
i
should
like
then
to
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
further
to
the
jurisdictional
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
yesterday.
the
statute
that
is
in
question
here
is
section
402
(a)
7.
it's
reprinted
in
the
government's
--
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
pertinent
part,
it
provides
that
a
state
plan
for
aid
and
services
to
needy
families
with
children
must
provide
that
the
state
agency
shall
in
determining
need
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
claiming
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
the
hew
regulation
construes
that
critical
language
any
other
income
and
resources
as
meaning
actual
income,
actual
contributions
made
by
stepfather
or
a
mars.
california's
approach
is
to
the
contrary.
they
assumed
that
where
there
is
a
stepfather
or
a
mars
that
his
income
is
attributable
and
is
a
resource
of
the
child
without
any
actual
proof.
that's
the
essence
of
the
controversy
here.
now,
california
agrees
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
if
hew's
regulation
is
valid,
as
a
proper
implementation
of
the
act,
that
california's
conflicting
statute
must
necessarily
fall
in
the
sense
that
california
can
no
longer
continue
to
be
entitled
to
receive
benefits
should
the
secretary
determine
to
cut
them
off.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
three
positions
that
you
could
take,
one
is
california
which
is
essentially
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
support
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
from
the
very
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
other
is
an
approach
that
could
be
regarded
as
consistent
with
the
hew
regulation
but
i
don't
think
it
is,
that
is
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
recipients
to
show
that
the
income
was
not
actually
received.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
but
our
view
is
that
the
regulation
--
the
language
of
the
regulation
speaks
in
terms
of
actual
contributions
and
income
actually
received
and
attempts
to
track
king
versus
smith
in
this
respect,
so
i
think
that
it's
the
third
category
which
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state
to
show
that
the
income
was
in
fact
received
so
as
to
reduce
--
in
extreme
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
and
california
has
raised
the
question
that
we
think
is
reasonable
question
here
about
seriousness
of
the
administrative
burden.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
we
have
checked
as
best
we
can,
hew
has
checked
on
my
behalf
determined
that
some
40
states
have
programs
that
do
exactly
this,
to
track
the
hew
regulation.
i
have
attempted
to
ascertain
whether
the
feeling
of
these
states
and
their
administrators
is
that
that's
a
practicable
way
to
proceed,
and
the
answer
has
been
yes.
it's
not
a
complete
survey
but
as
best
we
could
sample
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
most
of
them
proceed
as
we
proceed
in
the
income
tax
context,
they
require
self
disclosure
and
self
reporting.
perhaps
to
the
surprise
of
some,
they've
found
that
in
most
cases
this
works.
that
people
receiving
welfare
benefits
are
prepared
and
do
disclose
honestly
what
income
they
do
receive
from
other
sources.
this
is
the
basic
trust
of
president
nixon's
welfare
message,
the
notion
of
self
reporting
and
self
disclosure.
besides
that
there
are
case
workers
that
proceed
to
investigate
and
talk
to
these
people.
they
talk
to
the
man
and
they
talk
to
the
women,
whatever.
the
problem
there
is
very
significant,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
but
most
of
the
states
have
not
thought
that
they
are
insurmountable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
is
not
a
litigant
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
involved,
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
litigation
here
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
controversy
is
between
the
people
who
consider
themselves
entitled
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
state
can
theoretically
decline
a
debt
but
california
like
virtually
every
state
has
a
specific
statute
that
says
that
if
any
of
their
statutes
and
rules
and
regulations
in
the
welfare
context
are
inconsistent
with
federal
rules
and
regulations,
the
federal
rules
and
regulations
shall
prevail.
so,
while
theoretically
california
may
be
in
a
position
to
simply
remove
itself
from
the
federal
program
however
impractical
as
a
practical
matter,
they
have
made
this
judgment.
their
statute
section
11003
of
the
california
welfare
and
institutions
code
says
exactly
this.
we've
checked
other
states
statutes.
new
york
has
even
more
explicit
statute
that
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
can
do
this
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
social
security
act
for
needy.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
is
a
part
of
the
social
security
act
enacted
in
1935
as
your
honor
knows
and
this
afdc
program
has
been
in
existence
since
that
time.
congress
intended
i
think
it's
quite
clear.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
to
assist
the
state.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
they've
all
seemed
fit
to
do
that
and
they
all
as
we
know
is
practical
matter
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
very
real
controversy,
these
people
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
these
people
claim
benefits
and
the
claimed
that
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
difficulties
with
this
court
not
wanting
to
become
the
court
of
last
resort
and
welfare
disputes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
will
place
you
right
there
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
law
in
this
area
is
clarified
so
that
the
states
understand
the
obligations
they
have
and
i
think
king
versus
smith
went
a
long
way
in
that
direction.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
cases
like
this
are
decided,
it
will
be
clear
what
the
obligations
of
the
states
are.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor
with
all
respect
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
approach
is
changed
the
thing
and
so
long
as
the
court
establishes
that
the
federal
construction
of
the
act
is
the
appropriate
one
in
this
area,
then
the
state
will
necessary
have
to
abide
by
it.
and
i
think
california
and
new
york
and
the
other
states
have
already
made
this
judgment.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct
but
that's
circular
because
they've
already
made
this
judgment
unless
california
resends
the
statute,
it's
made
a
judgment
that
it
will
exceed
to
the
federal
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
correct.
and
that's
correct
they
can
but
whether
that's
a
reasonable
or
practical
courses
would
carry
not
just
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
approach
you
suggest
would
carry
over
to
every
federal
matching
grant
program
your
honor
and
would
simply
say
that
there's
no
justiciable
controversy
here
and
that
the
way
to
proceed
is
for
the
federal
government
always
to
cut
off
funds
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
proceeded
that
way
in
the
past
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
reason.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
with
all
respect
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
said
there
is
of
course
no
question
that
the
federal
government
unless
barred
by
some
controlling
constitutional
prohibition
may
impose
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
its
money
allotments
to
the
state
shall
be
dispersed
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
inconsistent
with
such
federal
terms
and
conditions
is
to
that
extent
invalid.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
king
versus
smith
was
as
much
a
case
of
controversy
as
the
present
case.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
suggesting
your
honor
that
if
the
court
clarifies
the
questions
raised
in
this
case
and
other
cases
that
there's
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
court
will
continue
to
be
involved
year
after
year
in
these
disputes
over
the
welfare
law.
once
the
secretary
has
his
authority
made
clear,
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
court
to
expect
that
he
allied.
but
there
have
been
serious
questions
about
this,
they
have
been
raised
in
litigation
and
they
are
before
the
court
presently.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
clear
on
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
is
not
any
new
set
of
regulations
there
on
the
question
here
at
issue
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
new
california
statute
as
mr.
amsterdam
discussed
yesterday
does
raise
with
respect
to
parts
of
the
controversy
before
the
court,
some
questions
that
have
to
be
resolved
i
think
on
remand
by
the
district
court
but
it
doesn't
do
away
with
the
entire
matter
here.
it
doesn't
touch
the
step
father
questions
and
california
is
continuing
to
act
as
far
as
we
know
under
the
old
statute.
they
have
not
yet
promulgated
regulations
--
officially
adopted
regulations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
new
statute
was
enacted
in
november
1969
and
we
agreed
that
there
are
questions
that
properly
should
be
probed
as
to
that
statute
and
its
effect
on
the
mars,
man
assuming
the
role
of
a
spouse
because
that's
all
that
it
relates
to
by
the
district
court
and
we
suggest
to
that
extent
to
the
remand
of
that
court
would
be
appropriate
but
that
doesn't
(inaudible)
--
your
honor,
i
really
have
had
a
chance
on
behalf
of
hew
to
make
the
affirmative
argument
and
could
i
have
several
minutes
to
do
so?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
on
the
validity
of
its
regulation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
about
five
minutes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
the
regulation
is
valid
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
we
think
that
the
presumption
of
validity
always
attaches
and
as
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
to
the
administrative
interpretation
by
a
government
official
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
administering
a
particular
act.
as
mr.
amsterdam
indicated
yesterday,
the
same
approach,
the
approach
of
requiring
proof
of
actual
income
before
reduction
of
benefits
has
been
applied
across
the
board
in
other
categorical
public
assistance
programs
by
hew.
moreover,
we
think
that
in
1967
congress
at
least
implicitly
approved
the
hew
regulation
when
it
reenacted
the
act
and
in
an
act
of
certain
amendments
to
these
provisions
knowing
what
hew's
construction
had
been
and
not
seeking
to
change
it.
moreover,
we
think
that
it's
quite
clear
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
specifically
referred
to
predecessor
regulation
and
said
regulations
of
hew,
this
is
in
footnote
16
of
king
versus
smith,
regulations
of
hew
which
clearly
comport
with
the
statute,
restrict
the
resources
which
are
to
be
taken
into
account
under
section
602
to
those
that,
"are
in
fact
available
to
an
applicant
or
recipient
for
current
use
on
a
regular
basis."
this
regulation
properly
excludes
from
consideration
resources
which
are
merely
assumed
to
be
available
to
the
needy
individual.
moreover,
the
court
earlier
this
term
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
by
the
court
--
the
district
court
in
connecticut
in
salman
versus
shapiro
which
is
reported
at
396
us
file
which
held
the
hew
regulation
valid
and
an
inconsistent
connecticut
practice
to
be
invalid.
moreover,
we
think
that
the
hew's
approach
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
which
is
to
provide
economic
security
to
the
five
million
plus
children
that
are
covered
by
this
act.
it's
a
massive
act.
this
regulation
is
an
important
part
of
it.
the
--
the
whole
program
involves
expenditure
of
over
$2
billion
by
the
federal
government
each
year,
a
total
expenditure
close
to
$4
billion.
california
statute
we
think
conflicts
with
this
regulation
and
since
california
has
a
statute
that
i
already
have
referred
to
which
says
that
when
it's
rules
and
regulations
conflict
the
federal
rules
shall
prevail,
we
think
whatever
the
relevance
of
this
supremacy
clause
that
in
this
context
the
district
court
improperly
struck
down
the
hew
regulation
and
improperly
upheld
the
california
approach.
california's
approach
of
assuming
support
simply
is
contrary
to
fact
in
most
cases.
moreover,
it
is
inconsistent
with
king
versus
smith
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated
earlier.
there's
some
language
in
that
opinion
that
counsel
might
prefer
to
but
that
language
is
always
accompanied
by
the
reference
to
support
in
fact
and
while
the
court
referred
to
a
legal
obligation,
it
also
referred
to
support
in
fact
as
coupled
therewith.
the
court
was
referring
king
versus
smith,
we
think
to
a
legal
obligation
of
general
applicability
not
the
strange
sort
of
thing
that
california
sought
to
carve
out.
indeed,
if
california
is
right,
alabama
could
have
avoided
the
decision
there
by
just
enacting
a
statute
which
said
“okay,
substitute
fathers
have
a
legal
obligation
of
support
whether
it
was
enforceable
or
not
what
difference
it
would
have
complied.”
now,
we
don't
think
the
court
intend
to
that
king
versus
smith.
we
don't
think
that
makes
good
sense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
your
honor,
that's
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
you
reach
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
--
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
if
you
pressed
it
to
the
ultimate
they
are
making
these
people
parents
and
by
definition
they're
not
eligible
--
but
california
doesn't
want
that
of
course,
because
the
statute
we're
talking
about
here
is
specifically
tailored
to
afdc
and
relates
only
to
that
context.
so,
they
are
simply
trying
to
reduce
the
benefits
that
people
receive
by
assumed
support
they
get
from
these
men
without
any
acts
of
proof
of
it,
and
i
think
that
if
california
were
pressed
too,
there
are
some
state
--
a
couple
of
states
have
adopted
statutes
that
at
least
as
the
stepfathers
place
a
general
obligation.
as
to
those
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
to
those
we
would
agree.
yes,
and
that's
washington
adopted
statute
and
i
think
a
couple
of
our
states.
that's
quite
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
couldn't
really
conceive
one
applied
to
mars
but
stepfathers
is
a
reason
--
i
think
is
a
feasible
thing
as
i
indicated
some
states
too.
and
that
makes
the
stepfather
--
the
regulation
itself,
the
first
part
which
i
didn't
read
specifically
provides
that.
it
says
that
born
relation
to
a
child's
stepparent
who
is
ceremonially
married
to
the
child's
natural
or
adopted
parent
and
is
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child
under
state
law
of
general
applicability
which
requires
stepparents
to
support
stepchildren
to
the
same
extent
that
natural
or
adopted
are
required
to
support
their
children.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
judgment
is
that
you
have
then
a
real
and
enforceable
obligation
that's
analogues
to
the
obligation
of
a
natural
or
an
adoptive
parent.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
one
that
meets
all
the
criteria
that
this
regulation
spells
out
which
is
one
of
general
--
the
person
becomes
just
as
natural
or
adoptive
father
or
stepfather.
now,
most
of
these
people
simply
don't
want
to
be
put
in
that
position
and
i
don't
think
most
states
are
going
to
adopt
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
your
--
well
yes,
and
just
as
you're
assuming
income
as
to
natural
parent
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
a
necessary
conclusion,
that's
the
way
the
regulation
reads
and
for
good
or
for
bad,
we
have
to
support
the
regulation.
but
i
think
that
it
coincides
with
the
common
sense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
idea
is
that
when
you
have
a
man
that's
willing
to
do
this
much
but
then
you
have
a
more
or
less
stable
family
unit
that
does
not
fit
under
the
category
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
so,
i
think
that
as
soon
as
you
try
to
put
an
obligation,
a
real
obligation
of
support
on
these
mars
people
at
least,
their
alternative
is
simply
to
get
out
and
that
california's
statute
both
as
to
stepfathers
and
as
to
mars
provides
that
they
have
an
obligation
of
support
only
when
they're
in
the
home,
if
they
leave
then
they
don't
have
an
obligation,
it
evaporates.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
been
the
result
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
has
real
teeth
when
it
deprives
people
that
need
support
of.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
the
reason
they
don't
stay
there
is
because
the
money
is
cut
off
and
since
their
income
is
assumed
to
be
available
but
it
is
not
really
available
because
they
have
other
children
to
support
or
whatever,
then
they
move
out
because
they
are
not
in
fact
able
to
provide
support.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
shows
up
in
the
early
legislative
history.
in
king
versus
smith,
i
think
the
court
made
clear
that
the
notion
of
punishing
the
kids
by
seeking
to
legislate
morality
for
the
mother
had
been
abandoned
by
congress
in
subsequent
amendments.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
notion
of
having
stable
family
units,
it
seems
to
me
that
hew's
approach
and
not
california
fosters
that
because
hew's
approach
allows
the
reduction
in
the
amount
of
benefit
payments
only
when
there
is
proof
of
actual
income
and
therefore,
when
there
is
not
actual
income
the
mars
or
the
stepfather
i
assume
will
continue
to
reside
with
the
children.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
value
worth
preserving,
hew's
approach
preserves,
the
california's
does
not.
california
forces
the
man
to
move
out
of
the
house
when
he
doesn't
have
income
that
helps
support
the
children
so
that
they
won't
receive
the
reduction,
it
won't
be
cutoff
as
to
some
of
the
people
on
this
case
were.
the
reasons
that
we
submitted
and
the
reason
stated
in
the
brief,
we
think
the
district
court
erred
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
alright.
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
supreme
court
of
california
has
not
had
a
chance
to
pass
squarely
on
this.
there's
some
lower
california
appellate
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
correct
but
i
don't
think
that
really
the
law
needs
too
much
construction
perhaps
counsel
from
california
will
illuminate
us
on
this
but
the
intermediate
appellate
court
decision
are
quite
ambiguous.
frankly,
they
speak
in
terms
of
the
obligation
of
support
not
being
a
general
one
that
applies
across
the
board
but
one
tailored
to
afdc.
well,
that's
quite
right
it
is
one
tailored
to
afdc.
there
was
a
case
where
one
of
these
people
said
that
this
law
was
a
deprivation
of
his
right
of
property.
california
couldn't
do
this
and
the
court
said
no
that's
not
right,
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
anything.
he
simply
--
his
income
is
simply
being
assumed
to
have
been
transferred
to
the
support
of
the
children.
so,
to
the
extent
that
this
california
authority,
it's
confusing
and
ambiguous
but
it
at
least
raises
questions
as
to
whether
the
duty
of
support
is
anything
more
than
a
loser
one.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
the
beginning
to
indicate
that
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
the
new
california
statute
and
question
of
mootness
is
as
stated
by
mr.
amsterdam,
we
feel
the
case
is
not
moot.
the
essential
questions
presented
to
the
court
when
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
california
statute
are
still
here,
those
basic
questions
relate
to
the
validity
of
the
hew
regulation.
we
agree
as
well
that
the
most
appropriate
course
would
be
for
the
court
as
to
the
effect
of
the
new
california
statute
assuming
the
reversal
of
the
decision
below
to
remand
it
to
the
lower
court
for
the
proceedings
to
determine
just
what
that
particular
statute
means
as
to
those
situations
affected
by
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
the
federal
government
can
do
that,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
a
result
that
of
course
is
not
one
which
is
desired
either
by
the
federal
government
or
i
would
think
by
the
state.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
one
way
to
express
it,
yes
your
honor.
the
statute
clearly
sets
out
the
responsibilities
of
the
secretary
and
one
of
those
responsibilities
is
to
pass
on
state
plans
and
very
elaborate
scheme
is
set
out
for
the
state
plans
and
what
they
should
entail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
may
well
be
a
better
means
of
effectuating
that.
however,
the
situation
that
we
have
here
as
the
court
well
knows
came
out
of
its
decision
king
versus
smith
prior
to
that
time,
hew
had
not
felt
itself
in
a
position
to
enforce
rigidly
on
the
states,
the
rules
that
it
had
promulgated
bolstered
by
king
versus
smith,
the
alabama
substitute
father
case,
hew
has
now
sought
to
enforce
those
regulations
in
this
case
of
course
came
along
at
this
time.
we
attempted
to
intervene
below
and
we
were
not
permitted
to
do
so
and
therefore
we
are
appearing
in
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
only
consequence
--
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
secretary
would
have
the
option
of
terminating
a
program
as
to
california,
in
fact
do
that
or
not
i
don't
know
because
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary
because
there's
so
a
reconcilable
and
necessarily
in
conflict
that
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
but
the
secretary
is
authorized
by
provisions
of
the
act
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
to
implement
it.
he
has
done
this
in
promulgating
this
regulation
that
we
have
before
us
now,
and
i
think
the
district
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
does
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
it
seems
to
me
all
that
it
results
in
is
that
california
must
have
a
program
as
some
40
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
then,
they
don't
have
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
the
hew
regulation
is
held
valid
by
this
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
then
the
california
statute
is
necessarily
invalid
since
it's
inconsistent
that
way
--now
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
but
the
likelihood
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
just
as
in
the
alabama
case,
alabama
after
king
versus
smith
could
have
i
suppose
said
that
it
no
longer
wanted
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
federal
program
and
gone
off
and
continued
to
have
its
substitute
father
rule.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
true,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
thing
in
context.
the
california
statute
is
written
specifically
to
apply
only
in
federal
afdc
program
cases.
it
was
obviously
designed
for
that
purpose,
that's
the
only
situation
in
which
it
applies.
now,
california
if
it
didn't
like
the
hew
regulation
could
obviously
draft
another
statute
entirely
unrelated
to
the
federal
program
for
welfare
assistance,
but
i
think
the
practical
likelihood
of
that
happening
is
very
remote.
the
federal
assistance
here
is
substantial
as
your
honor
knows
and
i
think
that
the
state
simply
couldn't
function
anywhere
near
a
reasonable
level
that
it
didn't
have
a
federal
matching
assistance.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
a
program
of
assistance.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
quite
appropriate
to
determine
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
--
or
at
least
that
the
secretary
has
the
option
of
cutting
them
off
for
failure
to
comply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
the
act
requires
that
the
state
be
in
compliance
with
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
validity
of
the
regulation
promulgated
by
hew
which
provides
in
substance
that
only
actual
support
payments,
the
actual
contributions
made
to
afdc
families
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
level
of
need
as
mr.
amsterdam
has
indicated.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
a
rather
harsh
approach
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there's
some
logic
in
it
but
in
the
meantime,
you
would
have
to
force
the
secretary
to
terminate
a
program
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
then,
there's
no
way
--
there's
no
way
that
then
the
secretary
could
get
the
validity
of
his
regulation
litigated.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
secretary
doesn't
think
that's
alright
and
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think
he
should
have
to.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honors
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
this
legislation
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
we
agree
that
it
has
a
right
to
do
so
but
as
to
the
question
of
rightness,
it
seems
to
me
that
forcing
the
federal
government
to
cut
off
the
funds
to
a
state
that
does
not
want
to
comply
with
what
hew
feels
is
a
reasonable
regulation
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
act,
the
secretary
is
charged
with
administering,
is
not
a
desirable
way
to
go
about
handling
this
matter
and
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
decided
that
in
king
versus
smith.
i
see
that
the
red
light
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
substance
of
the
position
of
the
government
which
in
essence
says
that
the
court
below
improperly
determined
that
that
the
hew
regulation
in
question
here
conflicted
with
the
statute.
if
time
permits,
i
should
like
then
to
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
further
to
the
jurisdictional
point
that
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
yesterday.
the
statute
that
is
in
question
here
is
section
402
(a)
7.
it's
reprinted
in
the
government's
--
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
pertinent
part,
it
provides
that
a
state
plan
for
aid
and
services
to
needy
families
with
children
must
provide
that
the
state
agency
shall
in
determining
need
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
claiming
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children.
the
hew
regulation
construes
that
critical
language
any
other
income
and
resources
as
meaning
actual
income,
actual
contributions
made
by
stepfather
or
a
mars.
california's
approach
is
to
the
contrary.
they
assumed
that
where
there
is
a
stepfather
or
a
mars
that
his
income
is
attributable
and
is
a
resource
of
the
child
without
any
actual
proof.
that's
the
essence
of
the
controversy
here.
now,
california
agrees
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
if
hew's
regulation
is
valid,
as
a
proper
implementation
of
the
act,
that
california's
conflicting
statute
must
necessarily
fall
in
the
sense
that
california
can
no
longer
continue
to
be
entitled
to
receive
benefits
should
the
secretary
determine
to
cut
them
off.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
three
positions
that
you
could
take,
one
is
california
which
is
essentially
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
support
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
from
the
very
fact
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
other
is
an
approach
that
could
be
regarded
as
consistent
with
the
hew
regulation
but
i
don't
think
it
is,
that
is
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
recipients
to
show
that
the
income
was
not
actually
received.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
but
our
view
is
that
the
regulation
--
the
language
of
the
regulation
speaks
in
terms
of
actual
contributions
and
income
actually
received
and
attempts
to
track
king
versus
smith
in
this
respect,
so
i
think
that
it's
the
third
category
which
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state
to
show
that
the
income
was
in
fact
received
so
as
to
reduce
--
in
extreme
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
and
california
has
raised
the
question
that
we
think
is
reasonable
question
here
about
seriousness
of
the
administrative
burden.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
now,
we
have
checked
as
best
we
can,
hew
has
checked
on
my
behalf
determined
that
some
40
states
have
programs
that
do
exactly
this,
to
track
the
hew
regulation.
i
have
attempted
to
ascertain
whether
the
feeling
of
these
states
and
their
administrators
is
that
that's
a
practicable
way
to
proceed,
and
the
answer
has
been
yes.
it's
not
a
complete
survey
but
as
best
we
could
sample
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
most
of
them
proceed
as
we
proceed
in
the
income
tax
context,
they
require
self
disclosure
and
self
reporting.
perhaps
to
the
surprise
of
some,
they've
found
that
in
most
cases
this
works.
that
people
receiving
welfare
benefits
are
prepared
and
do
disclose
honestly
what
income
they
do
receive
from
other
sources.
this
is
the
basic
trust
of
president
nixon's
welfare
message,
the
notion
of
self
reporting
and
self
disclosure.
besides
that
there
are
case
workers
that
proceed
to
investigate
and
talk
to
these
people.
they
talk
to
the
man
and
they
talk
to
the
women,
whatever.
the
problem
there
is
very
significant,
there's
no
doubt
about
it
but
most
of
the
states
have
not
thought
that
they
are
insurmountable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
is
not
a
litigant
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
involved,
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
litigation
here
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
controversy
is
between
the
people
who
consider
themselves
entitled
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
state
can
theoretically
decline
a
debt
but
california
like
virtually
every
state
has
a
specific
statute
that
says
that
if
any
of
their
statutes
and
rules
and
regulations
in
the
welfare
context
are
inconsistent
with
federal
rules
and
regulations,
the
federal
rules
and
regulations
shall
prevail.
so,
while
theoretically
california
may
be
in
a
position
to
simply
remove
itself
from
the
federal
program
however
impractical
as
a
practical
matter,
they
have
made
this
judgment.
their
statute
section
11003
of
the
california
welfare
and
institutions
code
says
exactly
this.
we've
checked
other
states
statutes.
new
york
has
even
more
explicit
statute
that
says
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
can
do
this
but
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
social
security
act
for
needy.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
is
a
part
of
the
social
security
act
enacted
in
1935
as
your
honor
knows
and
this
afdc
program
has
been
in
existence
since
that
time.
congress
intended
i
think
it's
quite
clear.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
to
assist
the
state.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
they've
all
seemed
fit
to
do
that
and
they
all
as
we
know
is
practical
matter
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
very
real
controversy,
these
people
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
these
people
claim
benefits
and
the
claimed
that
california
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
difficulties
with
this
court
not
wanting
to
become
the
court
of
last
resort
and
welfare
disputes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
will
place
you
right
there
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
law
in
this
area
is
clarified
so
that
the
states
understand
the
obligations
they
have
and
i
think
king
versus
smith
went
a
long
way
in
that
direction.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
cases
like
this
are
decided,
it
will
be
clear
what
the
obligations
of
the
states
are.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
your
honor
with
all
respect
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
approach
is
changed
the
thing
and
so
long
as
the
court
establishes
that
the
federal
construction
of
the
act
is
the
appropriate
one
in
this
area,
then
the
state
will
necessary
have
to
abide
by
it.
and
i
think
california
and
new
york
and
the
other
states
have
already
made
this
judgment.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct
but
that's
circular
because
they've
already
made
this
judgment
unless
california
resends
the
statute,
it's
made
a
judgment
that
it
will
exceed
to
the
federal
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
correct.
and
that's
correct
they
can
but
whether
that's
a
reasonable
or
practical
courses
would
carry
not
just
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
approach
you
suggest
would
carry
over
to
every
federal
matching
grant
program
your
honor
and
would
simply
say
that
there's
no
justiciable
controversy
here
and
that
the
way
to
proceed
is
for
the
federal
government
always
to
cut
off
funds
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
proceeded
that
way
in
the
past
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
reason.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor
with
all
respect
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
said
there
is
of
course
no
question
that
the
federal
government
unless
barred
by
some
controlling
constitutional
prohibition
may
impose
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
its
money
allotments
to
the
state
shall
be
dispersed
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
inconsistent
with
such
federal
terms
and
conditions
is
to
that
extent
invalid.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
king
versus
smith
was
as
much
a
case
of
controversy
as
the
present
case.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i'm
suggesting
your
honor
that
if
the
court
clarifies
the
questions
raised
in
this
case
and
other
cases
that
there's
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
court
will
continue
to
be
involved
year
after
year
in
these
disputes
over
the
welfare
law.
once
the
secretary
has
his
authority
made
clear,
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
court
to
expect
that
he
allied.
but
there
have
been
serious
questions
about
this,
they
have
been
raised
in
litigation
and
they
are
before
the
court
presently.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
clear
on
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
is
not
any
new
set
of
regulations
there
on
the
question
here
at
issue
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
new
california
statute
as
mr.
amsterdam
discussed
yesterday
does
raise
with
respect
to
parts
of
the
controversy
before
the
court,
some
questions
that
have
to
be
resolved
i
think
on
remand
by
the
district
court
but
it
doesn't
do
away
with
the
entire
matter
here.
it
doesn't
touch
the
step
father
questions
and
california
is
continuing
to
act
as
far
as
we
know
under
the
old
statute.
they
have
not
yet
promulgated
regulations
--
officially
adopted
regulations.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
new
statute
was
enacted
in
november
1969
and
we
agreed
that
there
are
questions
that
properly
should
be
probed
as
to
that
statute
and
its
effect
on
the
mars,
man
assuming
the
role
of
a
spouse
because
that's
all
that
it
relates
to
by
the
district
court
and
we
suggest
to
that
extent
to
the
remand
of
that
court
would
be
appropriate
but
that
doesn't
(inaudible)
--
your
honor,
i
really
have
had
a
chance
on
behalf
of
hew
to
make
the
affirmative
argument
and
could
i
have
several
minutes
to
do
so?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
on
the
validity
of
its
regulation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
about
five
minutes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
think
that
the
regulation
is
valid
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
we
think
that
the
presumption
of
validity
always
attaches
and
as
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
to
the
administrative
interpretation
by
a
government
official
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
administering
a
particular
act.
as
mr.
amsterdam
indicated
yesterday,
the
same
approach,
the
approach
of
requiring
proof
of
actual
income
before
reduction
of
benefits
has
been
applied
across
the
board
in
other
categorical
public
assistance
programs
by
hew.
moreover,
we
think
that
in
1967
congress
at
least
implicitly
approved
the
hew
regulation
when
it
reenacted
the
act
and
in
an
act
of
certain
amendments
to
these
provisions
knowing
what
hew's
construction
had
been
and
not
seeking
to
change
it.
moreover,
we
think
that
it's
quite
clear
in
king
versus
smith,
the
court
specifically
referred
to
predecessor
regulation
and
said
regulations
of
hew,
this
is
in
footnote
16
of
king
versus
smith,
regulations
of
hew
which
clearly
comport
with
the
statute,
restrict
the
resources
which
are
to
be
taken
into
account
under
section
602
to
those
that,
"are
in
fact
available
to
an
applicant
or
recipient
for
current
use
on
a
regular
basis."
this
regulation
properly
excludes
from
consideration
resources
which
are
merely
assumed
to
be
available
to
the
needy
individual.
moreover,
the
court
earlier
this
term
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
by
the
court
--
the
district
court
in
connecticut
in
salman
versus
shapiro
which
is
reported
at
396
us
file
which
held
the
hew
regulation
valid
and
an
inconsistent
connecticut
practice
to
be
invalid.
moreover,
we
think
that
the
hew's
approach
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
which
is
to
provide
economic
security
to
the
five
million
plus
children
that
are
covered
by
this
act.
it's
a
massive
act.
this
regulation
is
an
important
part
of
it.
the
--
the
whole
program
involves
expenditure
of
over
$2
billion
by
the
federal
government
each
year,
a
total
expenditure
close
to
$4
billion.
california
statute
we
think
conflicts
with
this
regulation
and
since
california
has
a
statute
that
i
already
have
referred
to
which
says
that
when
it's
rules
and
regulations
conflict
the
federal
rules
shall
prevail,
we
think
whatever
the
relevance
of
this
supremacy
clause
that
in
this
context
the
district
court
improperly
struck
down
the
hew
regulation
and
improperly
upheld
the
california
approach.
california's
approach
of
assuming
support
simply
is
contrary
to
fact
in
most
cases.
moreover,
it
is
inconsistent
with
king
versus
smith
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated
earlier.
there's
some
language
in
that
opinion
that
counsel
might
prefer
to
but
that
language
is
always
accompanied
by
the
reference
to
support
in
fact
and
while
the
court
referred
to
a
legal
obligation,
it
also
referred
to
support
in
fact
as
coupled
therewith.
the
court
was
referring
king
versus
smith,
we
think
to
a
legal
obligation
of
general
applicability
not
the
strange
sort
of
thing
that
california
sought
to
carve
out.
indeed,
if
california
is
right,
alabama
could
have
avoided
the
decision
there
by
just
enacting
a
statute
which
said
“okay,
substitute
fathers
have
a
legal
obligation
of
support
whether
it
was
enforceable
or
not
what
difference
it
would
have
complied.”
now,
we
don't
think
the
court
intend
to
that
king
versus
smith.
we
don't
think
that
makes
good
sense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
your
honor,
that's
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
you
reach
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
--
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
if
you
pressed
it
to
the
ultimate
they
are
making
these
people
parents
and
by
definition
they're
not
eligible
--
but
california
doesn't
want
that
of
course,
because
the
statute
we're
talking
about
here
is
specifically
tailored
to
afdc
and
relates
only
to
that
context.
so,
they
are
simply
trying
to
reduce
the
benefits
that
people
receive
by
assumed
support
they
get
from
these
men
without
any
acts
of
proof
of
it,
and
i
think
that
if
california
were
pressed
too,
there
are
some
state
--
a
couple
of
states
have
adopted
statutes
that
at
least
as
the
stepfathers
place
a
general
obligation.
as
to
those
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
to
those
we
would
agree.
yes,
and
that's
washington
adopted
statute
and
i
think
a
couple
of
our
states.
that's
quite
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
couldn't
really
conceive
one
applied
to
mars
but
stepfathers
is
a
reason
--
i
think
is
a
feasible
thing
as
i
indicated
some
states
too.
and
that
makes
the
stepfather
--
the
regulation
itself,
the
first
part
which
i
didn't
read
specifically
provides
that.
it
says
that
born
relation
to
a
child's
stepparent
who
is
ceremonially
married
to
the
child's
natural
or
adopted
parent
and
is
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child
under
state
law
of
general
applicability
which
requires
stepparents
to
support
stepchildren
to
the
same
extent
that
natural
or
adopted
are
required
to
support
their
children.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
judgment
is
that
you
have
then
a
real
and
enforceable
obligation
that's
analogues
to
the
obligation
of
a
natural
or
an
adoptive
parent.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
has
to
be
one
that
meets
all
the
criteria
that
this
regulation
spells
out
which
is
one
of
general
--
the
person
becomes
just
as
natural
or
adoptive
father
or
stepfather.
now,
most
of
these
people
simply
don't
want
to
be
put
in
that
position
and
i
don't
think
most
states
are
going
to
adopt
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
your
--
well
yes,
and
just
as
you're
assuming
income
as
to
natural
parent
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
right.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
a
necessary
conclusion,
that's
the
way
the
regulation
reads
and
for
good
or
for
bad,
we
have
to
support
the
regulation.
but
i
think
that
it
coincides
with
the
common
sense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
idea
is
that
when
you
have
a
man
that's
willing
to
do
this
much
but
then
you
have
a
more
or
less
stable
family
unit
that
does
not
fit
under
the
category
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
so,
i
think
that
as
soon
as
you
try
to
put
an
obligation,
a
real
obligation
of
support
on
these
mars
people
at
least,
their
alternative
is
simply
to
get
out
and
that
california's
statute
both
as
to
stepfathers
and
as
to
mars
provides
that
they
have
an
obligation
of
support
only
when
they're
in
the
home,
if
they
leave
then
they
don't
have
an
obligation,
it
evaporates.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
been
the
result
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
has
real
teeth
when
it
deprives
people
that
need
support
of.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
the
reason
they
don't
stay
there
is
because
the
money
is
cut
off
and
since
their
income
is
assumed
to
be
available
but
it
is
not
really
available
because
they
have
other
children
to
support
or
whatever,
then
they
move
out
because
they
are
not
in
fact
able
to
provide
support.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
shows
up
in
the
early
legislative
history.
in
king
versus
smith,
i
think
the
court
made
clear
that
the
notion
of
punishing
the
kids
by
seeking
to
legislate
morality
for
the
mother
had
been
abandoned
by
congress
in
subsequent
amendments.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
notion
of
having
stable
family
units,
it
seems
to
me
that
hew's
approach
and
not
california
fosters
that
because
hew's
approach
allows
the
reduction
in
the
amount
of
benefit
payments
only
when
there
is
proof
of
actual
income
and
therefore,
when
there
is
not
actual
income
the
mars
or
the
stepfather
i
assume
will
continue
to
reside
with
the
children.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
value
worth
preserving,
hew's
approach
preserves,
the
california's
does
not.
california
forces
the
man
to
move
out
of
the
house
when
he
doesn't
have
income
that
helps
support
the
children
so
that
they
won't
receive
the
reduction,
it
won't
be
cutoff
as
to
some
of
the
people
on
this
case
were.
the
reasons
that
we
submitted
and
the
reason
stated
in
the
brief,
we
think
the
district
court
erred
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
alright.
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
supreme
court
of
california
has
not
had
a
chance
to
pass
squarely
on
this.
there's
some
lower
california
appellate
court
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
correct
but
i
don't
think
that
really
the
law
needs
too
much
construction
perhaps
counsel
from
california
will
illuminate
us
on
this
but
the
intermediate
appellate
court
decision
are
quite
ambiguous.
frankly,
they
speak
in
terms
of
the
obligation
of
support
not
being
a
general
one
that
applies
across
the
board
but
one
tailored
to
afdc.
well,
that's
quite
right
it
is
one
tailored
to
afdc.
there
was
a
case
where
one
of
these
people
said
that
this
law
was
a
deprivation
of
his
right
of
property.
california
couldn't
do
this
and
the
court
said
no
that's
not
right,
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
anything.
he
simply
--
his
income
is
simply
being
assumed
to
have
been
transferred
to
the
support
of
the
children.
so,
to
the
extent
that
this
california
authority,
it's
confusing
and
ambiguous
but
it
at
least
raises
questions
as
to
whether
the
duty
of
support
is
anything
more
than
a
loser
one.
thank
you.
