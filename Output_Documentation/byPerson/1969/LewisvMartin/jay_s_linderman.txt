mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
--
i
might
start
mr.
justice
black
in
trying
to
answer
your
question
regarding
a
determination
by
the
secretary
of
hew
of
whether
california
is
in
compliance
and
if
not,
why
not
cut
california
off.
when
this
litigation
started
in
the
district
court,
california
officials
were
in
the
process
then
of
trying
to
determine
from
hew
whether
in
fact,
hew
felt
that
the
california
statute
and
regulations
were
in
conflict
and
we
were
unable
to
even
receive
a
definitive
statement
from
hew
whether
or
not
the
secretary
considered
california
to
be
in
compliance
or
not.
and
we
urge
the
various
correspondents
on
this
subject
was
attached
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
filed
in
the
district
court
and
we
urge
the
district
court
at
that
time
that
there
is
a
procedure
in
the
social
security
act
for
resolving
disputes
between
the
states
and
hew
as
to
whether
a
state
plan
does
or
does
not
comply.
the
secretary
makes
a
determination
of
noncompliance.
the
state
is
given
the
authority
to
petition
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
particular
circuit
for
determination
of
that
specific
issue.
we
urge
the
district
court
to
allow
us
to
do
that
or
at
least
to
first
allow
us
to
receive
a
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
to
utilize
the
procedure
set
forth
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
in
the
social
security
act
provides
a
procedure
for
resolving
a
dispute
between
the
states
and
hew.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
what
is
the
procedure?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
hew
makes
a
determination
of
noncompliance
of
a
state
plan,
the
state
may
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
particular
circuit
in
which
the
state
is
located.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
my
understanding
mr.
justice
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
determination,
the
languages
is
a
determination
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
a
--
a
formal
determination.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it
--
in
california
what
was
happening
at
the
time
this
suit
started
was
considerable
correspondence
going
back
and
forth
between
the
governor
and
the
director
of
the
state
primary
social
welfare.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
the
secretary
at
that
time
is
secretary
cohen.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
nothing
at
that
point
because
when
the
suit
was
filed,
california
was
still
in
the
process
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
secretary
had
even
made
a
determination
that
california
was
not
in
compliance
and
then
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
middle
of
it,
and
we
urge
the
district
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
the
question
of
whether
the
state
plan
conflicts
or
conforms.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume
so
yes
and
that
is
what
we
were
attempting
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume
that
it
is
a
written
communicate
from
the
secretary
of
hew
that,
dear
governor
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
questionable
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
nevada.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
this
is
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
that's
correct
but
what
happened
in
the
california
instance
was
the
state
director
of
social
welfare
did
receive
a
letter
from
the
secretary,
then
secretary
cohen
setting
forth
various
reasons
why
the
secretary
felt
that
california
was
not
in
compliance.
the
director
from
california
then
wrote
back
to
the
secretary
and
said,
“if
this
is
a
determination
of
noncompliance,
then
we
respectfully
request
reconsideration
but
please
tell
us
what
it
is
that
you
are
saying”
and
we
never
received
a
reply
to
that.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it's
not
in
the
correspondence
mr.justice,
it
is
attached
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
state
filed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it's
in
the
record
but
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
its
section
1116
of
the
social
security
act.
i
don't
have
the
us
code
citation
but
it
is
i
believe
its
section
1116.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
the
timing
mr.
justice
black,
the
correspondence
was
in
the
summer
of
1968,
and
the
first
of
these
two
consolidated
cases
was
filed
in
october
of
'68,
but
as
far
as
the
state
was
concerned,
we
had
never
received
any
definitive
statement
from
the
secretary
as
to
whether
we
were
or
we're
not
in
compliance
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
never
since,
other
the
appearance
of
hew
as
amicus
in
this
proceeding
alleging
that
we
are
not
in
compliance.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
pardon
me.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
right.
the
lawsuit
now
is
the
alleged
beneficiaries
against
the
state
alleging
that
the
state
is
not
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
to
my
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
justice
--.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
anymore
improper
or
inappropriate
method
than
coming
directly
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
resolve
the
same
question
with
not
much
more
record.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
could
sue
the
state?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
course,
it
could
but
i
doubt
very
much.
i
think
i
can
speak
for
the
state.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
course,
of
course
but
i
think
i
can
speak
for
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
as
it
chose,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
constitutional
restrictions
would
be
the
only
one.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
well,
i
think
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
arguing
that
irrespective
of
the
supremacy
clause
problem
in
the
case
that
even
assuming
that
there's
no
problem
there
that
california
is
distributing
its
funds
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
definitely.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
their
allegation
is
that
the
obligation
which
california
places
on
mars
in
a
welfare
home
only
as
opposed
to
a
mars
in
a
non-welfare
home
denies
equal
protection
to
the
children
in
the
welfare
home
and
to
the
mars
in
the
welfare
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
are
raising
the
question
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
are
raising
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
it
would
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
oh,
it
is.
but
this
is
an
aspect
of
their
lawsuit
also
as
the
equal
protection
problem
which
assuming
that
california
were
running
its
own
welfare
program,
not
receiving
federal
matching
funds
presumably
the
same
constitutional
limitations
are
going
to
have
to
apply.
the
only
ones
that
would
be
eliminated
would
be
the
regulations
of
hew
and
the
act
of
cardozo.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
don't
question
the
fact
that
california
must
comply
with
valid
hew
regulations
and
an
act
of
congress
in
order
to
be
able
to
qualify
to
receive
the
federal
funds.
we
are
not
disputing
that
at
all.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
none
whatsoever
and
nor
do
we
question
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
hew
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
to
fill
up
the
details
of
the
social
security.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
question
about
it
mr.
justice
black.
our
position
however
is
though
that
the
secretary
of
hew
in
his
regulations
has
exceeded
the
scope
of
authority
given
to
him
by
congress
in
the
social
security
act.
we
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
question
that
that's
the
crucial
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
not
--
i
would
conceive
that
yes.
my
point
initially
was
that
there
is
an
alternative
procedures
that
the
controversy
could
first
be
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don't
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
exactly.
i
assume
though
that
even
if
that
were
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
reach
here.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
the
hew
regulation
has
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
one
is
the
secretary's
definition
of
who
maybe
a
parent
which
of
course
goes
to
the
question
of
is
the
child
a
dependent
child
and
eligible
or
not
eligible
for
assistance.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
at
all.
if
the
person
is
determined
to
be
a
parent,
there
is
no
eligibility
with
the
exception
of
the
unemployed
parent
and
the
optional
afdc
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
by
definition,
social
security
act
sets
up
afdc
eligibility
for
a
child
who
is
deprived
of
parental
support
because
on
the
absence
of
a
parent.
hew
in
subsection
a
of
its
regulation
203.1
says
that,
the
only
person
who
can
be
a
parent
is
a
natural
father,
an
adopted
father
or
a
stepfather
who
is
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child
to
the
same
extent
as
a
natural
or
adoptive
father.
if
that's
correct
--
now
california
is
not
attempting
to
define
children
living
with
a
mars
or
stepfather
as
non-dependent
children.
we
are
not
trying
to
call
the
stepfather
or
the
mars
a
parent.
but
under
hew's
definition,
the
only
thing
california
did
wrong
was
to
limit
the
stepparent
liability
to
a
stepparent
in
a
welfare
home.
if
california
had
imposed
an
obligation
on
all
stepfathers
to
support
their
children,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
hew
regulation,
california
could
determine
all
needy
children
in
a
home
with
a
stepfather
totally
ineligible
for
aid
and
it
certainly
escapes
me
how
the
child
--
the
needy
child
in
a
welfare
home
derives
anymore
economic
protection
from
the
extension
of
the
stepfather
liability
to
a
stepfather
in
a
non-welfare
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
we
can
easily
remedy
the
situation
mr.
justice
stewart
by
simply
exchanging
our
support
obligation
statute
and
making
all
stepfathers
liable
for
the
support
of
their
children.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
which
to
me
would
be
frustrative
of
the
purposes
of
afdc
which
is
to
impose
a
support
obligation
on
a
stepfather
in
a
relatively
affluent
family.
certainly,
it
gives
no
economic
protection
to
the
child
with
a
stepfather
in
a
poor
family.
it
makes
no
sense
but
if
the
hew
regulation
is
valid,
i
think
i
can
state
with
relative
certainty
that
california
will
just
extend
its
stepfather
liability
statute
and
cut
off
all
children
in
stepfather
homes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assuming
an
employed
stepfather
because
if
you
were
unemployed
then
the
family
would
qualify
under
california's
optional
afdcu
in
the
argument.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
are
not
cutting
off
children
now
though
mr.
justice
white,
we're
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we're
reducing
payments
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assumed
availability
because
of
the
support
obligation.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
some
children
living
with
stepfathers
are
still
receiving
aid
because
the
stepfather's
net
income
is
insufficient
to
bring
the
family
up
to
the
states'
maximum
budget
for
the
family.
but
if
we
extend
the
stepfather
liability
to
non
afdc
family
stepfathers,
then
the
children
in
the
afdc
family
with
the
stepfathers
are
going
to
be
totally
cutoff.
there
are
now
children
in
the
afdc
stepfather
family
who
are
still
receiving
aid,
all
be
it
less
aid
because
of
the
obligation
of
support
on
the
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
old
--
it
still
does
in
a
different
fashion.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we've
modified
it
but
the
statute
which
was
the
subject
of
litigation
in
the
court
below,
the
obligation
was
that
the
mars
had
to
support
the
children
in
his
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
like
the
stepfather
and
i
would
submit
that
if
hew
thinks
that
you
can
extend
statewide
general
law
of
amicability
to
a
stepfather
and
thereby
make
no
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
can
do
it
with
the
man
equally
as
well
and
in
fact,
i
would
think
might
have
to
do
it
not
because
of
any
moral
antipathy
to
the
common
law
marriage
but
if
you
don't
do
it,
a
man
is
crazy
to
marry
the
welfare
mother.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
oh,
i
think
very
definitely
so.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
yet,
there's
--
no,
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
suit
but
the
same
problem,
the
problem
of
assuming
that
there
is
a
meaningful
support
obligation
that's
a
different
kind
of
obligation
now.
but
the
same
question
of
whether
the
obligation
that
california
imposes
is
an
enforceable
one
and
a
source
of
a
resource
to
the
child
will
remain
even
under
the
new
regulation,
it
will
take
on
different
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
your
question
is
directed
to
the
point
isn't
a
natural
father
more
apt
to
support
his
child
than
a
stepfather,
is
that
the
gist
of
your
question?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
say,
yes,
if
the
kind
of
stepfather
or
the
man
in
the
house
that
california
is
talking
about
is
the
same
kind
of
a
man
as
alabama
had
in
king
versus
smith.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
because
the
federal
regulation
mr.
justice
white
is
not
geared
to
the
factual
realities
of
who
these
men
are
that
california
is
concerned
with.
they
are
not
the
midnight
visitor
in
king
versus
smith
who
had
a
family
of
his
own
and
nine
children
and
no
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
the
social
security
act
compels
assumption
of
income
though
where
there's
a
law
of
support.
as
this
court
interpreted
the
purposes
of
afdc
in
king
versus
smith,
it
was
to
provide
support
for
children
without
--
who
could
not
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
invalid.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
the
social
security
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
king
versus
smith.
that
congress
expects
that
when
there
is
a
breadwinner
in
the
home
that
the
breadwinner
will
support
the
child
and
the
social
security
act
says
that
the
state
has
to
--
the
second
part
of
this
is
that
the
state
has
to
determine
the
extent
of
need
of
the
children
in
the
home
and
the
child
is
deemed
less
needy
because
of
the
resource
which
is
assumed
by
congress
in
view
to
the
benefit
of
the
child
because
of
the
support
obligation.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
there
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
appreciate
that
problem
but
it's
not
any
different
than
the
child
living
with
a
natural
father
who
may
not
support
it.
the
child
or
his
mother
has
to
sue
the
man
not
the
state.
the
state
doesn't
pay
aid
and
then
pursue
the
man.
the
child
has
to
get
the
money
from
the
man.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
unemployed
fathers,
not
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
there
are
statistics
that
would
indicate
how
many
families
we're
talking
about
which
contain
--
the
figures
are
july
1968
and
at
that
time
there
were
roughly
191,000
families
--
afdc
families
in
california
and
of
that
there
were
6,700
families
with
the
stepfather
and
2,800
families
with
the
mars.
a
total
of
roughly
9,500
families
out
of
191,000
families
but
of
the
191,000,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
statistics
on
how
many
of
those
are
unemployed
fathers.
i
could
easily
obtain
them
and
supply
them
to
the
court
if
you
will.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct
and
it's
the
same
assumption
as
applies
with
a
natural
father
in
the
home
and
it's
an
assumption
that
there
is
an
enforceability.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
your
honor
by
definition
these
men
are
not
transients.
these
are
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
by
the
state
definition
before
the
application
of
the
rule
even
can
begin
the
person
--
the
man
in
the
house
by
definition
is
living
in
the
home
and
is,
in
stepfather
case,
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
or
in
the
mars
case
is
living
in
the
home
and
has
either
assumed
financial
obligations
on
behalf
of
the
family
or
comports
himself
in
the
community
as
husband
and
wife.
and
one
of
the
crucial
criteria
of
determining
who
is
the
mars
is
that
he
has
no
other
alternative
place
of
residence.
just
as
his
family
and
to
the
extent
that
he
is
a
trencher
the
moment
he
leaves
the
home
the
child
is
restored
the
eligibility.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
who
has
left?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
would
have
to
go
to
court
only
to
the
extent
to
collect
back
payments
that
might
be
due.
once
the
man
leaves
the
house
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
to
collect
the
back
payments.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
for
the
mars
or
the
stepfather.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
for
the
legitimate
father,
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
after
he
leaves
the
house.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
after
he
leaves
the
house
but
not
one
of
his
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
while
the
man
is
in
the
house.
while
the
man
is
in
the
house
be
he
a
natural
father
or
adoptive
father
or
stepfather
or
mars,
the
state
does
not
pursue
his
resources
for
the
child.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
the
wife
applies
for
relief
in
the
natural
father
case
and
he
is
living
in
the
home,
relief
is
denied,
they
are
ineligible
by
definition.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
they
can
find
it.
but
with
mars,
the
state
does
not
pursue
it
because
there's
no
more
obligation
and
the
state
pays
aid
at
that
point
in
time.
the
other
one
important
resource
which
i
think
is
unique
in
the
west,
particularly
in
california,
in
the
case
of
the
stepfather
is
that
under
california
community
property
law,
the
earnings
of
the
stepfather
are
community
property
in
which
the
wife,
the
welfare
mother
has
a
vested
present
one-half
interest.
half
of
his
earnings
are
hers.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
what
the
stepfather
only.
yes,
after
the
ceremonial
marriage,
there
is
no
community
property
in
a
putative
marriage.
there
is
in
a
meretricious
--
in
the
putative
there
is,
in
a
meretricious
there
is
not.
in
other
words,
these
people
know
they
are
not
married,
the
mars
and
the
mother
and
there
is
no
community
property
there.
if
one
of
them
harbors
the
mistake
and
belief
that
they
are
married,
there
can
be
community
property
there.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
mother
has
ceremonially
married
the
man.
community
property
then
attaches
to
his
earnings,
and
half
of
his
earnings
are
hers.
i
would
submit
that
if
there
is
anything
that
is
a
resource
which
the
social
security
act
commands
california
to
consider
in
determining
need,
that
is
a
resource.
again,
the
mother
may
have
to
take
legal
action
to
protect
her
half
interest,
but
that's
no
different
than
the
mother
living
with
the
natural
father
of
her
children.
she
also
may
have
to
take
legal
recourse
but
the
obligation
is
clearly
enforceable.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
section
402(a)(7)
which
is
42
u.
s.
c.,
section
602(a)(7).
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
it
appears
at
several
places.
it's
in
the
appendix
--
it's
cited
throughout
all
the
briefs.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
read
the
language.
the
place
is
the
first
page
of
the
appendix
in
the
government's
brief.
this
is
section
602(a)(7).
it's
one
of
the
series
of
requirements
of
the
social
security
act
as
to
what
state
plan
must
provide
and
says
that
a
state
plan
for
aid
and
services
to
needy
families
with
children
must,
underscore
must,
provide
that
the
state
shall
in
determining
need
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
claiming
aid.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
exactly.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
assumed.
no,
no,
our
position
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
of
the
child
or
the
mother.
see,
it's
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
claiming
aid.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
mother
and
the
child.
that's
the
child
or
the
mother.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assume
that
it
is
available
because
it
is
a
resource.
it's
something
in
addition
to
prove
an
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
neither
is
the
resource
of
the
child
living
with
a
natural
father.
the
natural
father
may
not
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
king
versus
smith,
if
there
is
a
legal
obligation
of
support,
proof
of
actual
contribution
cannot
be
determinative.
that's
the
language
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
because
it
defines
a
child
in
california
to
be
resourceless.
the
child
can
have
nothing
other
than
the
income
that
the
state
through
some
administrative
miracle
can
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
but
the
mother
will
undoubtedly
kick
the
man
out
of
the
house.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
it
is
a
weapon.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
white.
it's
a
weapon.
it's
a
method
of
enforcement
of
the
obligation
that
the
state
is
reducing
the
grant
and
the
mother
can
say
with
real
meaning
support
me
or
get
out.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
complaints
in
this
case
despite
their
protestations
that
the
men
are
not
supporting
the
children
in
the
house.
the
complainants
themselves
admit
that
due
to
the
emergency
as
the
language
that
the
plaintiff
appellant
used
that
due
to
the
emergency
caused
by
this
state
statute,
the
men
are
supporting
the
children
until
the
statute
is
declared
invalid.
the
statute
does
work,
it
is
enforceable
and
the
men
are
supporting
the
children
at
least
some
of
the
names
plaintiffs
are
and
the
record
will
show
that.
the
other
fact
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
stepfather
and
presumably
in
the
mars
as
well.
it's
literally
impossible
for
them
not
to
support
them
at
least
in
some
of
these
cases
where
the
man
has
taken
the
welfare
mother
and
her
children
into
his
home.
he
has
put
a
roof
over
their
head
which
is
the
case
in
several
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
appeal.
the
man
has
brought
the
children
into
his
home.
now,
certainly
to
some
extent,
he
is
putting
a
roof
over
their
head
which
is
a
lessened
need
for
public
expense
to
support
that
family.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
challenge.
yes,
it
does
have
a
maximum
grant
and
the
case
has
been
argued
before
this
court.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
is
a
maximum
amount
of
shelter
need.
although,
there
is
another
case
in
california
on
that
issue,
that
the
state
law
and
the
social
security
act
although
the
argument
is
compelled
the
state
pay
actual
shelter
needs.
but
the
--
the
current
system
is
that
there
are
allocated
specific
amounts
for
each
of
the
various
needs,
shelter,
food,
clothing,
and
so
on.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
with
a
maximum
per
family
unit
up
to
the
point,
i
believe
it's
ten
children
and
from
that
point
on
there
is
$6.00
added
per
child
after
ten
children
which
the
attack
of
the
statute
is
in
that
force
is
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
through
the
questioning
that
i've
covered
most
of
the
points
that
i
wished
to
cover
unless
the
court
has
further
question.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
that
is
somewhat
fair.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
the
question
is
how
much
--
taking
king
versus
smith
as
the
starting
point
of
what
it
is
and
what
is
not
allowable.
the
child
in
a
home
where
there
is
a
legally
obligated
man
--
a
support
obligated
man,
a
burden
may
fall
on
that
child
because
the
person,
the
man
may
not
be
performing
his
duty.
to
that
extent,
inherent
in
the
social
security
act,
in
the
afdc
program
is
that
the
child
may
be
harmed
because
of
a
delinquent
father.
but
so
long
as
he
remains
in
the
house,
the
burden
is
the
child's
and
our
essential
argument
is
that
the
support
obligation
which
california
imposes
on
mars
or
stepfather
in
the
house
may
put
a
burden
on
the
child.
although,
we
question
that
factually
that
does
happen
that
often
as
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
it
is
not
as
absurd
as
the
appellants
would
argue
to
expect
that
a
man
will
support
someone
other
than
his
own
children.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
support
obligation,
the
social
security
act
resubmit,
makes
that
child
either
a
non-dependent
child
because
it's
a
natural
parent
or
a
less
needy
child
because
of
a
perhaps
lesser
support
obligation,
clearly
enforceable
but
the
extent
of
the
obligation
on
the
man
may
be
less
in
terms
of
dollar
amount.
the
support
obligation
on
natural
father
is
without
limitation.
the
support
obligation
on
the
mars
and
the
stepfather,
as
the
state
computes
the
amount
of
the
obligation
may
turn
out
to
be
a
lesser
amount
than
the
amount
the
natural
father
would
have
to
pay.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
social
security
act
is
only
one
of
many
programs
to
try
alleviate
poverty.
but
to
the
--
it's
limited,
it
is
to
provide
support
for
children
who
do
not
have
some
breadwinner
to
look
to.
it's
not
essentially
that
the
breadwinner
perform
his
duty
of
supporting
the
children.
congress
expected
that
the
bread
winner
would
support
the
children
in
his
home.
california
expects
the
same
thing
but
the
natural
father
or
the
mars
or
the
stepfather
may
spend
his
earnings
on
wine,
women
or
so
or
whatever,
the
children
may
suffer
but
the
social
--
but
the
afdc
program
is
not
the
way
that
you
solve
that
problem.
thank
you.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
--
i
might
start
mr.
justice
black
in
trying
to
answer
your
question
regarding
a
determination
by
the
secretary
of
hew
of
whether
california
is
in
compliance
and
if
not,
why
not
cut
california
off.
when
this
litigation
started
in
the
district
court,
california
officials
were
in
the
process
then
of
trying
to
determine
from
hew
whether
in
fact,
hew
felt
that
the
california
statute
and
regulations
were
in
conflict
and
we
were
unable
to
even
receive
a
definitive
statement
from
hew
whether
or
not
the
secretary
considered
california
to
be
in
compliance
or
not.
and
we
urge
the
various
correspondents
on
this
subject
was
attached
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
filed
in
the
district
court
and
we
urge
the
district
court
at
that
time
that
there
is
a
procedure
in
the
social
security
act
for
resolving
disputes
between
the
states
and
hew
as
to
whether
a
state
plan
does
or
does
not
comply.
the
secretary
makes
a
determination
of
noncompliance.
the
state
is
given
the
authority
to
petition
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
particular
circuit
for
determination
of
that
specific
issue.
we
urge
the
district
court
to
allow
us
to
do
that
or
at
least
to
first
allow
us
to
receive
a
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
to
utilize
the
procedure
set
forth
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
in
the
social
security
act
provides
a
procedure
for
resolving
a
dispute
between
the
states
and
hew.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
what
is
the
procedure?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
hew
makes
a
determination
of
noncompliance
of
a
state
plan,
the
state
may
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
particular
circuit
in
which
the
state
is
located.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
my
understanding
mr.
justice
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
determination,
the
languages
is
a
determination
that
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
a
--
a
formal
determination.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it
--
in
california
what
was
happening
at
the
time
this
suit
started
was
considerable
correspondence
going
back
and
forth
between
the
governor
and
the
director
of
the
state
primary
social
welfare.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
and
the
secretary
at
that
time
is
secretary
cohen.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
nothing
at
that
point
because
when
the
suit
was
filed,
california
was
still
in
the
process
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
secretary
had
even
made
a
determination
that
california
was
not
in
compliance
and
then
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
middle
of
it,
and
we
urge
the
district
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
the
question
of
whether
the
state
plan
conflicts
or
conforms.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume
so
yes
and
that
is
what
we
were
attempting
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume
that
it
is
a
written
communicate
from
the
secretary
of
hew
that,
dear
governor
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
questionable
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
nevada.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
this
is
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
that's
correct
but
what
happened
in
the
california
instance
was
the
state
director
of
social
welfare
did
receive
a
letter
from
the
secretary,
then
secretary
cohen
setting
forth
various
reasons
why
the
secretary
felt
that
california
was
not
in
compliance.
the
director
from
california
then
wrote
back
to
the
secretary
and
said,
“if
this
is
a
determination
of
noncompliance,
then
we
respectfully
request
reconsideration
but
please
tell
us
what
it
is
that
you
are
saying”
and
we
never
received
a
reply
to
that.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it's
not
in
the
correspondence
mr.justice,
it
is
attached
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
state
filed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it's
in
the
record
but
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
its
section
1116
of
the
social
security
act.
i
don't
have
the
us
code
citation
but
it
is
i
believe
its
section
1116.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
the
timing
mr.
justice
black,
the
correspondence
was
in
the
summer
of
1968,
and
the
first
of
these
two
consolidated
cases
was
filed
in
october
of
'68,
but
as
far
as
the
state
was
concerned,
we
had
never
received
any
definitive
statement
from
the
secretary
as
to
whether
we
were
or
we're
not
in
compliance
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
never
since,
other
the
appearance
of
hew
as
amicus
in
this
proceeding
alleging
that
we
are
not
in
compliance.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
pardon
me.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
right.
the
lawsuit
now
is
the
alleged
beneficiaries
against
the
state
alleging
that
the
state
is
not
in
compliance
with
federal
law.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
to
my
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
justice
--.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
anymore
improper
or
inappropriate
method
than
coming
directly
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
resolve
the
same
question
with
not
much
more
record.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
could
sue
the
state?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
course,
it
could
but
i
doubt
very
much.
i
think
i
can
speak
for
the
state.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
of
course,
of
course
but
i
think
i
can
speak
for
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
as
it
chose,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
constitutional
restrictions
would
be
the
only
one.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
well,
i
think
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
arguing
that
irrespective
of
the
supremacy
clause
problem
in
the
case
that
even
assuming
that
there's
no
problem
there
that
california
is
distributing
its
funds
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
definitely.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
their
allegation
is
that
the
obligation
which
california
places
on
mars
in
a
welfare
home
only
as
opposed
to
a
mars
in
a
non-welfare
home
denies
equal
protection
to
the
children
in
the
welfare
home
and
to
the
mars
in
the
welfare
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
are
raising
the
question
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
are
raising
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
it
would
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
oh,
it
is.
but
this
is
an
aspect
of
their
lawsuit
also
as
the
equal
protection
problem
which
assuming
that
california
were
running
its
own
welfare
program,
not
receiving
federal
matching
funds
presumably
the
same
constitutional
limitations
are
going
to
have
to
apply.
the
only
ones
that
would
be
eliminated
would
be
the
regulations
of
hew
and
the
act
of
cardozo.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
don't
question
the
fact
that
california
must
comply
with
valid
hew
regulations
and
an
act
of
congress
in
order
to
be
able
to
qualify
to
receive
the
federal
funds.
we
are
not
disputing
that
at
all.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
none
whatsoever
and
nor
do
we
question
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
hew
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
to
fill
up
the
details
of
the
social
security.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
question
about
it
mr.
justice
black.
our
position
however
is
though
that
the
secretary
of
hew
in
his
regulations
has
exceeded
the
scope
of
authority
given
to
him
by
congress
in
the
social
security
act.
we
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
question
that
that's
the
crucial
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
not
--
i
would
conceive
that
yes.
my
point
initially
was
that
there
is
an
alternative
procedures
that
the
controversy
could
first
be
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don't
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
exactly.
i
assume
though
that
even
if
that
were
resolved
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
reach
here.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
the
hew
regulation
has
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
one
is
the
secretary's
definition
of
who
maybe
a
parent
which
of
course
goes
to
the
question
of
is
the
child
a
dependent
child
and
eligible
or
not
eligible
for
assistance.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
at
all.
if
the
person
is
determined
to
be
a
parent,
there
is
no
eligibility
with
the
exception
of
the
unemployed
parent
and
the
optional
afdc
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
by
definition,
social
security
act
sets
up
afdc
eligibility
for
a
child
who
is
deprived
of
parental
support
because
on
the
absence
of
a
parent.
hew
in
subsection
a
of
its
regulation
203.1
says
that,
the
only
person
who
can
be
a
parent
is
a
natural
father,
an
adopted
father
or
a
stepfather
who
is
legally
obligated
to
support
the
child
to
the
same
extent
as
a
natural
or
adoptive
father.
if
that's
correct
--
now
california
is
not
attempting
to
define
children
living
with
a
mars
or
stepfather
as
non-dependent
children.
we
are
not
trying
to
call
the
stepfather
or
the
mars
a
parent.
but
under
hew's
definition,
the
only
thing
california
did
wrong
was
to
limit
the
stepparent
liability
to
a
stepparent
in
a
welfare
home.
if
california
had
imposed
an
obligation
on
all
stepfathers
to
support
their
children,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
hew
regulation,
california
could
determine
all
needy
children
in
a
home
with
a
stepfather
totally
ineligible
for
aid
and
it
certainly
escapes
me
how
the
child
--
the
needy
child
in
a
welfare
home
derives
anymore
economic
protection
from
the
extension
of
the
stepfather
liability
to
a
stepfather
in
a
non-welfare
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
we
can
easily
remedy
the
situation
mr.
justice
stewart
by
simply
exchanging
our
support
obligation
statute
and
making
all
stepfathers
liable
for
the
support
of
their
children.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
which
to
me
would
be
frustrative
of
the
purposes
of
afdc
which
is
to
impose
a
support
obligation
on
a
stepfather
in
a
relatively
affluent
family.
certainly,
it
gives
no
economic
protection
to
the
child
with
a
stepfather
in
a
poor
family.
it
makes
no
sense
but
if
the
hew
regulation
is
valid,
i
think
i
can
state
with
relative
certainty
that
california
will
just
extend
its
stepfather
liability
statute
and
cut
off
all
children
in
stepfather
homes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
assume.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assuming
an
employed
stepfather
because
if
you
were
unemployed
then
the
family
would
qualify
under
california's
optional
afdcu
in
the
argument.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we
are
not
cutting
off
children
now
though
mr.
justice
white,
we're
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we're
reducing
payments
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assumed
availability
because
of
the
support
obligation.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
some
children
living
with
stepfathers
are
still
receiving
aid
because
the
stepfather's
net
income
is
insufficient
to
bring
the
family
up
to
the
states'
maximum
budget
for
the
family.
but
if
we
extend
the
stepfather
liability
to
non
afdc
family
stepfathers,
then
the
children
in
the
afdc
family
with
the
stepfathers
are
going
to
be
totally
cutoff.
there
are
now
children
in
the
afdc
stepfather
family
who
are
still
receiving
aid,
all
be
it
less
aid
because
of
the
obligation
of
support
on
the
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
old
--
it
still
does
in
a
different
fashion.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
we've
modified
it
but
the
statute
which
was
the
subject
of
litigation
in
the
court
below,
the
obligation
was
that
the
mars
had
to
support
the
children
in
his
home.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
like
the
stepfather
and
i
would
submit
that
if
hew
thinks
that
you
can
extend
statewide
general
law
of
amicability
to
a
stepfather
and
thereby
make
no
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
can
do
it
with
the
man
equally
as
well
and
in
fact,
i
would
think
might
have
to
do
it
not
because
of
any
moral
antipathy
to
the
common
law
marriage
but
if
you
don't
do
it,
a
man
is
crazy
to
marry
the
welfare
mother.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
oh,
i
think
very
definitely
so.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no
yet,
there's
--
no,
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
suit
but
the
same
problem,
the
problem
of
assuming
that
there
is
a
meaningful
support
obligation
that's
a
different
kind
of
obligation
now.
but
the
same
question
of
whether
the
obligation
that
california
imposes
is
an
enforceable
one
and
a
source
of
a
resource
to
the
child
will
remain
even
under
the
new
regulation,
it
will
take
on
different
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
your
question
is
directed
to
the
point
isn't
a
natural
father
more
apt
to
support
his
child
than
a
stepfather,
is
that
the
gist
of
your
question?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
would
say,
yes,
if
the
kind
of
stepfather
or
the
man
in
the
house
that
california
is
talking
about
is
the
same
kind
of
a
man
as
alabama
had
in
king
versus
smith.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
because
the
federal
regulation
mr.
justice
white
is
not
geared
to
the
factual
realities
of
who
these
men
are
that
california
is
concerned
with.
they
are
not
the
midnight
visitor
in
king
versus
smith
who
had
a
family
of
his
own
and
nine
children
and
no
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
the
social
security
act
compels
assumption
of
income
though
where
there's
a
law
of
support.
as
this
court
interpreted
the
purposes
of
afdc
in
king
versus
smith,
it
was
to
provide
support
for
children
without
--
who
could
not
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
invalid.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
the
social
security
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
king
versus
smith.
that
congress
expects
that
when
there
is
a
breadwinner
in
the
home
that
the
breadwinner
will
support
the
child
and
the
social
security
act
says
that
the
state
has
to
--
the
second
part
of
this
is
that
the
state
has
to
determine
the
extent
of
need
of
the
children
in
the
home
and
the
child
is
deemed
less
needy
because
of
the
resource
which
is
assumed
by
congress
in
view
to
the
benefit
of
the
child
because
of
the
support
obligation.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
there
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
appreciate
that
problem
but
it's
not
any
different
than
the
child
living
with
a
natural
father
who
may
not
support
it.
the
child
or
his
mother
has
to
sue
the
man
not
the
state.
the
state
doesn't
pay
aid
and
then
pursue
the
man.
the
child
has
to
get
the
money
from
the
man.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
unemployed
fathers,
not
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
there
are
statistics
that
would
indicate
how
many
families
we're
talking
about
which
contain
--
the
figures
are
july
1968
and
at
that
time
there
were
roughly
191,000
families
--
afdc
families
in
california
and
of
that
there
were
6,700
families
with
the
stepfather
and
2,800
families
with
the
mars.
a
total
of
roughly
9,500
families
out
of
191,000
families
but
of
the
191,000,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
statistics
on
how
many
of
those
are
unemployed
fathers.
i
could
easily
obtain
them
and
supply
them
to
the
court
if
you
will.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
correct
and
it's
the
same
assumption
as
applies
with
a
natural
father
in
the
home
and
it's
an
assumption
that
there
is
an
enforceability.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
your
honor
by
definition
these
men
are
not
transients.
these
are
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
by
the
state
definition
before
the
application
of
the
rule
even
can
begin
the
person
--
the
man
in
the
house
by
definition
is
living
in
the
home
and
is,
in
stepfather
case,
ceremonially
married
to
the
mother
or
in
the
mars
case
is
living
in
the
home
and
has
either
assumed
financial
obligations
on
behalf
of
the
family
or
comports
himself
in
the
community
as
husband
and
wife.
and
one
of
the
crucial
criteria
of
determining
who
is
the
mars
is
that
he
has
no
other
alternative
place
of
residence.
just
as
his
family
and
to
the
extent
that
he
is
a
trencher
the
moment
he
leaves
the
home
the
child
is
restored
the
eligibility.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
who
has
left?
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
they
would
have
to
go
to
court
only
to
the
extent
to
collect
back
payments
that
might
be
due.
once
the
man
leaves
the
house
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
to
collect
the
back
payments.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
for
the
mars
or
the
stepfather.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
for
the
legitimate
father,
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
after
he
leaves
the
house.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
after
he
leaves
the
house
but
not
one
of
his
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
while
the
man
is
in
the
house.
while
the
man
is
in
the
house
be
he
a
natural
father
or
adoptive
father
or
stepfather
or
mars,
the
state
does
not
pursue
his
resources
for
the
child.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
the
wife
applies
for
relief
in
the
natural
father
case
and
he
is
living
in
the
home,
relief
is
denied,
they
are
ineligible
by
definition.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
if
they
can
find
it.
but
with
mars,
the
state
does
not
pursue
it
because
there's
no
more
obligation
and
the
state
pays
aid
at
that
point
in
time.
the
other
one
important
resource
which
i
think
is
unique
in
the
west,
particularly
in
california,
in
the
case
of
the
stepfather
is
that
under
california
community
property
law,
the
earnings
of
the
stepfather
are
community
property
in
which
the
wife,
the
welfare
mother
has
a
vested
present
one-half
interest.
half
of
his
earnings
are
hers.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
that's
what
the
stepfather
only.
yes,
after
the
ceremonial
marriage,
there
is
no
community
property
in
a
putative
marriage.
there
is
in
a
meretricious
--
in
the
putative
there
is,
in
a
meretricious
there
is
not.
in
other
words,
these
people
know
they
are
not
married,
the
mars
and
the
mother
and
there
is
no
community
property
there.
if
one
of
them
harbors
the
mistake
and
belief
that
they
are
married,
there
can
be
community
property
there.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
mother
has
ceremonially
married
the
man.
community
property
then
attaches
to
his
earnings,
and
half
of
his
earnings
are
hers.
i
would
submit
that
if
there
is
anything
that
is
a
resource
which
the
social
security
act
commands
california
to
consider
in
determining
need,
that
is
a
resource.
again,
the
mother
may
have
to
take
legal
action
to
protect
her
half
interest,
but
that's
no
different
than
the
mother
living
with
the
natural
father
of
her
children.
she
also
may
have
to
take
legal
recourse
but
the
obligation
is
clearly
enforceable.

mr.

linderman
yes,
it

at
several
places.
it's
in
the
appendix
--
it's
cited
throughout
all
the

mr.

i
read

the
place
is

first
page
of

in

this
is

it's
one
of
the
series
of
requirements
of

as
to

must

says
that

mr.

yes.
mr.

s.
linderman
exactly.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
not
assumed.
no,
no,
our
position
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
of
the
child
or
the
mother.
see,
it's
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
claiming
aid.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
mother
and
the
child.
that's
the
child
or
the
mother.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
assume
that
it
is
available
because
it
is
a
resource.
it's
something
in
addition
to
prove
an
income.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
neither
is
the
resource
of
the
child
living
with
a
natural
father.
the
natural
father
may
not
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
king
versus
smith,
if
there
is
a
legal
obligation
of
support,
proof
of
actual
contribution
cannot
be
determinative.
that's
the
language
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes,
because
it
defines
a
child
in
california
to
be
resourceless.
the
child
can
have
nothing
other
than
the
income
that
the
state
through
some
administrative
miracle
can
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no,
but
the
mother
will
undoubtedly
kick
the
man
out
of
the
house.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
but
it
is
a
weapon.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
white.
it's
a
weapon.
it's
a
method
of
enforcement
of
the
obligation
that
the
state
is
reducing
the
grant
and
the
mother
can
say
with
real
meaning
support
me
or
get
out.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
complaints
in
this
case
despite
their
protestations
that
the
men
are
not
supporting
the
children
in
the
house.
the
complainants
themselves
admit
that
due
to
the
emergency
as
the
language
that
the
plaintiff
appellant
used
that
due
to
the
emergency
caused
by
this
state
statute,
the
men
are
supporting
the
children
until
the
statute
is
declared
invalid.
the
statute
does
work,
it
is
enforceable
and
the
men
are
supporting
the
children
at
least
some
of
the
names
plaintiffs
are
and
the
record
will
show
that.
the
other
fact
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
stepfather
and
presumably
in
the
mars
as
well.
it's
literally
impossible
for
them
not
to
support
them
at
least
in
some
of
these
cases
where
the
man
has
taken
the
welfare
mother
and
her
children
into
his
home.
he
has
put
a
roof
over
their
head
which
is
the
case
in
several
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
appeal.
the
man
has
brought
the
children
into
his
home.
now,
certainly
to
some
extent,
he
is
putting
a
roof
over
their
head
which
is
a
lessened
need
for
public
expense
to
support
that
family.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
under
challenge.
yes,
it
does
have
a
maximum
grant
and
the
case
has
been
argued
before
this
court.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
there
is
a
maximum
amount
of
shelter
need.
although,
there
is
another
case
in
california
on
that
issue,
that
the
state
law
and
the
social
security
act
although
the
argument
is
compelled
the
state
pay
actual
shelter
needs.
but
the
--
the
current
system
is
that
there
are
allocated
specific
amounts
for
each
of
the
various
needs,
shelter,
food,
clothing,
and
so
on.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
with
a
maximum
per
family
unit
up
to
the
point,
i
believe
it's
ten
children
and
from
that
point
on
there
is
$6.00
added
per
child
after
ten
children
which
the
attack
of
the
statute
is
in
that
force
is
--
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
yes.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
through
the
questioning
that
i've
covered
most
of
the
points
that
i
wished
to
cover
unless
the
court
has
further
question.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
that
is
somewhat
fair.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
i
think
the
question
is
how
much
--
taking
king
versus
smith
as
the
starting
point
of
what
it
is
and
what
is
not
allowable.
the
child
in
a
home
where
there
is
a
legally
obligated
man
--
a
support
obligated
man,
a
burden
may
fall
on
that
child
because
the
person,
the
man
may
not
be
performing
his
duty.
to
that
extent,
inherent
in
the
social
security
act,
in
the
afdc
program
is
that
the
child
may
be
harmed
because
of
a
delinquent
father.
but
so
long
as
he
remains
in
the
house,
the
burden
is
the
child's
and
our
essential
argument
is
that
the
support
obligation
which
california
imposes
on
mars
or
stepfather
in
the
house
may
put
a
burden
on
the
child.
although,
we
question
that
factually
that
does
happen
that
often
as
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
it
is
not
as
absurd
as
the
appellants
would
argue
to
expect
that
a
man
will
support
someone
other
than
his
own
children.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
support
obligation,
the
social
security
act
resubmit,
makes
that
child
either
a
non-dependent
child
because
it's
a
natural
parent
or
a
less
needy
child
because
of
a
perhaps
lesser
support
obligation,
clearly
enforceable
but
the
extent
of
the
obligation
on
the
man
may
be
less
in
terms
of
dollar
amount.
the
support
obligation
on
natural
father
is
without
limitation.
the
support
obligation
on
the
mars
and
the
stepfather,
as
the
state
computes
the
amount
of
the
obligation
may
turn
out
to
be
a
lesser
amount
than
the
amount
the
natural
father
would
have
to
pay.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
no.
mr.
jay
s.
linderman
the
social
security
act
is
only
one
of
many
programs
to
try
alleviate
poverty.
but
to
the
--
it's
limited,
it
is
to
provide
support
for
children
who
do
not
have
some
breadwinner
to
look
to.
it's
not
essentially
that
the
breadwinner
perform
his
duty
of
supporting
the
children.
congress
expected
that
the
bread
winner
would
support
the
children
in
his
home.
california
expects
the
same
thing
but
the
natural
father
or
the
mars
or
the
stepfather
may
spend
his
earnings
on
wine,
women
or
so
or
whatever,
the
children
may
suffer
but
the
social
--
but
the
afdc
program
is
not
the
way
that
you
solve
that
problem.
thank
you.
