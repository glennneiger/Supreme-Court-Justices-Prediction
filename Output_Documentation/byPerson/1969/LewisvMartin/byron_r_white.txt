written
papers
filed
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
any
of
this
discussions
about
the
new
statute
or
the
new
regulation
in
the
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
i
ask
you?
even
if
the
hew
regulation
is
valid
contrary
to
the
conclusion
of
the
three-judge
court,
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
to
mean
this
that
if
california
persists
with
its
regulation,
the
only
consequence
is
that
it
may
forfeit
its
federal
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there's
before
us
not
only
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
federal
regulation,
but
assuming
that
we
conclude
contrary
to
the
three-judge
court
that
it
is
valid
that
we
must
also
determine
the
validity
of
the
state
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
they
maybe
in
conflict
but
does
that
make
the
california
regulation
invalid
or
does
it
mean
only
that
the
secretary
may
then
exercise
the
option
to
cut
off
the
federal
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it's
valid,
does
that
then
supersede
so
as
to
make
invalidly
the
california
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
goes
a
little
further
than
just
forfeiture
of
the
federal
contribution
in
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
california
says,
“we
want
no
part
of
your
federal
contribution.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
they
can
go
ahead
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
all
we
--
how
do
we
then
declare
their
regulation
invalid
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
invalid
if
california
wants
to
go
on
its
own
without
any
federal
contributions
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
all
we
hold
is
that
the
cost
of
federal
regulation
is
valid
if
we
do,
that
then
leaves
the
secretary
in
a
position
where
he
can
say
to
california,
“now
you
get
rid
of
that
regulation
of
yours
so
you
don't
get
any
federal
contribution.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
isn't
the
kind
of
preemption
supersession
whatever
words
you
want
to
use.
now,
we
ordinarily
have
when
there's
a
conflict
between
a
federal
regulation
and
the
state
regulation
as
in
the
avocado
cases
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
if
california
had
a
general
statute
applying
to
the
mars
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
you
say
that
was
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
state
can
substantiate
the
fact
that
there's
a
legal
obligation
to
support
the
children
in
the
house,
his
living
in
the
house
there's
a
legal
obligation
under
the
state
law
to
support
those
children
and
if
it's
enforceable
you
would
say
the
state
regulation
is
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no,
but
when
you
say
that
that
would
be
alright,
what
you
are
really
doing
is
assuming
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
a
parent.
with
their
parent,
with
a
natural
parent
living
at
home.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
parent
moves
out
you
no
longer
assume
income,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
as
long
as
he
is
at
home
you
assume
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
you
would
be
willing
to
assume
income
if
the
state
had
the
proper
law
with
respect
to
stepfather.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
really
--
you
think
this
represents
a
professional
expert
judgment
as
to
what
likely
reality
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
experience
would
show
that
in
the
mars
situation
it's
just
contrary
to
the
reality
assumingly.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
sure
well
that's
the
result
of
this
regulation
has
been
to
--
that
some
mars
have
left.
does
that
happen
in
one
or
two
of
these
cases
or
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
be
that
the
california
regulation
has
some
real
teeth
in
the
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
it
deprives
mars
out
of
the
family
must
be
because
there's
a
real
obligation
as
long
as
they
stay
there,
then
why
isn't
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
just
interrupt
you
for
a
moment.
it
has
to
be
formal
disapproval
about
the
state
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
but
it
does
some
kind
of
a
formal
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
seek
determination.
is
there
a
hearing,
what
happens
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
took
by
correspondent
with
the
state
officials
and
the
hew?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
formal
proceeding
administratively
before
the
board
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
suggested
that
the
review
expressly
provided
that
the
statute
in
the
appropriate
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
review
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
have
to
be
reviewed
some
formal
determination
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume--
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example,
would
this
be
the
case?
if
your
california
officials
had
received
from
hew
a
letter
which
said,
we
don't
think
that
california
plan
complies
with
the
federal
regulations.
you
could
have
judicial
review
on
the
ninth
circuit
of
that
letter
of
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
these
are
compliance
proceedings
under
the
statute
aren't
they?
the
hew
as
i
understand
is
only
proceeded
against
two
states
and
there's
long
history
of
this.
one
is
connecticut
and
the
other
is
nevada,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
compliance
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
come
into
--
they
come
up
to
adjudication
whether
they
can
be
reviewed
has
never
been
determined.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
state
could
have
a
social
security
wholly
independent
of
ideal
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
constitutionally
speaking.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
question
that
that's
controversy
between
that's
involved
in
this
case
even
though
the
parties
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
welfare
benefit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
that
that
issue
is
a
case
of
controversy
properly
before
this
court
for
decision
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
what's
you
were
addressing
yourself
earlier.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you'd
manage
to
do
something
somehow?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
won't
care
about
unless
the
stepfather
has
an
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
won't
cut
off
anymore
children
as
you
are
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
reducing
payments
by
assuming
the
income
of
the
stepfather.
justice
byron
r.
white
availability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
so
you
reduce
the
payments
on
accountability.
one,
you
wouldn't
do
it
--
you
wouldn't
cut
off
anymore
if
you
extend
that
your
obligation
is
right
across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
mars?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
old
law,
you
said
you
changed
it,
you
put
the
obligation
on
him
to
do
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you've
modified.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
stepfather
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
do
it
with
the
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
--
is
the
mars
issue
a
live,
a
real
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
back
payments
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
new
regulation
is
not
an
issue
in
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
--
wouldn't
you
suppose
though
that
as
a
matter
of
experience
you
could
justify
assuming
income
--
assuming
availability
of
income
where
the
real
parent
is
living
at
home
and
have
a
wholly
different
experience
with
stepfathers
or
mars
who
are
living
in
the
home,
just
in
terms
actual
availability
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
isn't
the
federal
regulation
--a
valid
expression
of
a
--
valid
judgment
along
those
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
the
invalidity
of
it
might
be
is
it
permit
the
assumption
of
income
or
availability
of
income
where
there
is
a
statewide
law
of
general
applicability
if
that's
contrary
to
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
invalid
under
the
social
security
act
for
hew
to
provide
by
regulation
that
income
of
natural
parents,
availability
of
income
or
the
natural
parent
living
in
the
home
will
not
be
assumed?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
specific
language
in
the
social
security
act
do
you
rely
on
for
arguing
that
the
federal
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
talking
about
income
and
resources
of
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who's
claiming
aid?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you've
got
to
say
that
income
don't
have
to
assume
the
availability
of
income
from
the
mars
and
stepfather.
either
to
the
mother
of
the
child.
you
said
that
act
requires
that.
whether
it's
a
mars
in
the
house
or
stepfather
in
the
house
and
the
state
has
legal
obligation
that
this
act
requires
that
you
assume
that
that
income
is
available
to
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
it
is
the
natural
resource
must
be
factual.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
point
for
you
and
i
would
make
the
same
argument
that
perhaps
the
hew
did
say
that
it
is
the
parent
living
in
the
house
as
i
am
going
to
assume.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
not
be
determinative
of
the
--
you
pick
the
regulation
which
requires
proof
of
active
contribution
as
invalid
to
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
regularly
and
definitely,
that
would
be
the
excuse
to
contribute
anything
to
the
support
the
child
regardless
of
the
legal
obligation
for
him
imposed
by
the
state,
is
that
what
you
were
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
very
relevant
for
a
legal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
written
papers
filed
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
any
of
this
discussions
about
the
new
statute
or
the
new
regulation
in
the
brief?
justice
byron

white
well,
may
i

you?

justice

then,
all
we

how
do
we
then
declare
their

that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at?
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice

it's
not
invalid
if
california

byron
r.
white
no,
these
are
compliance
proceedings
under
the
statute
aren't
they?
the
hew
as
i
understand
is
only
proceeded
against
two
states
and
there's
long
history
of
this.
one
is
connecticut
and
the
other
is
nevada,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
compliance
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
come
into
--
they
come
up
to
adjudication
whether
they
can
be
reviewed
has
never
been
determined.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
state
could
have
a
social
security
wholly
independent
of
ideal
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
constitutionally
speaking.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
question
that
that's
controversy
between
that's
involved
in
this
case
even
though
the
parties
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
welfare
benefit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
that
that
issue
is
a
case
of
controversy
properly
before
this
court
for
decision
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
what's
you
were
addressing
yourself
earlier.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you'd
manage
to
do
something
somehow?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
won't
care
about
unless
the
stepfather
has
an
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
won't
cut
off
anymore
children
as
you
are
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
reducing
payments
by
assuming
the
income
of
the
stepfather.
justice
byron
r.
white
availability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
so
you
reduce
the
payments
on
accountability.
one,
you
wouldn't
do
it
--
you
wouldn't
cut
off
anymore
if
you
extend
that
your
obligation
is
right
across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
mars?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
old
law,
you
said
you
changed
it,
you
put
the
obligation
on
him
to
do
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you've
modified.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
stepfather
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
do
it
with
the
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
--
is
the
mars
issue
a
live,
a
real
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
back
payments
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
new
regulation
is
not
an
issue
in
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
--
wouldn't
you
suppose
though
that
as
a
matter
of
experience
you
could
justify
assuming
income
--
assuming
availability
of
income
where
the
real
parent
is
living
at
home
and
have
a
wholly
different
experience
with
stepfathers
or
mars
who
are
living
in
the
home,
just
in
terms
actual
availability
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
isn't
the
federal
regulation
--a
valid
expression
of
a
--
valid
judgment
along
those
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
the
invalidity
of
it
might
be
is
it
permit
the
assumption
of
income
or
availability
of
income
where
there
is
a
statewide
law
of
general
applicability
if
that's
contrary
to
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
invalid
under
the
social
security
act
for
hew
to
provide
by
regulation
that
income
of
natural
parents,
availability
of
income
or
the
natural
parent
living
in
the
home
will
not
be
assumed?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
specific
language
in
the
social
security
act
do
you
rely
on
for
arguing
that
the
federal
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
talking
about
income
and
resources
of
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who's
claiming
aid?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you've
got
to
say
that
income
don't
have
to
assume
the
availability
of
income
from
the
mars
and
stepfather.
either
to
the
mother
of
the
child.
you
said
that
act
requires
that.
whether
it's
a
mars
in
the
house
or
stepfather
in
the
house
and
the
state
has
legal
obligation
that
this
act
requires
that
you
assume
that
that
income
is
available
to
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
it
is
the
natural
resource
must
be
factual.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
point
for
you
and
i
would
make
the
same
argument
that
perhaps
the
hew
did
say
that
it
is
the
parent
living
in
the
house
as
i
am
going
to
assume.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
not
be
determinative
of
the
--
you
pick
the
regulation
which
requires
proof
of
active
contribution
as
invalid
to
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
regularly
and
definitely,
that
would
be
the
excuse
to
contribute
anything
to
the
support
the
child
regardless
of
the
legal
obligation
for
him
imposed
by
the
state,
is
that
what
you
were
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
very
relevant
for
a
