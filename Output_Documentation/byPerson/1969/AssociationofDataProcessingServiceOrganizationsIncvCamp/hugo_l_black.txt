your
position
makes
it
very
hard
doesn’t
it
for
anyone
to
attack
except
in
government
agent.
justice
hugo
l.

well,
then
what
do
you
say
to
the
question
that
i
asked
you,
doesn’t
it
make
it
almost
impossible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody
could
challenge
it
except
the
bank
officers
of
the
superintendent
of
banks
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
again,
assuming
that
they
are
right
and
that
congress
has
made
it
unlawful
for
these
banks
to
do
exactly
what
they
have
charge
for
duty
and
did
it
in
order
to
protect
competitors,
is
it
your
position
that
nobody
cannot
challenge
it
except
the
bank
examiner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
their
argument
in
hardin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood
the
argument
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
that
that’s
true,
let’s
assume
it
was
passed
for
that
purpose,
is
it
still
your
--
and
it
maybe
said,
i'm
not
saying
it’s
not.
i
want
to
get
just
how
far
it
goes.
it’s
still
your
argument
notwithstanding
express
as
that
of
congress
to
give
this
kind
of
competitors
a
protection
that
none
of
them
can
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
the
question
of
my
brother
harlan
asked
you
a
little
bit
ago,
if
that’s
the
case,
aren’t
you
saying
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
act
in
order
to
see
whether
that
was
its
purpose
to
decide
standing?
justice
hugo
l.

was
it
hard
for
you
to
tell
a
man
who
doesn’t
know
all
about
bank
services
what
bank
services
precisely
what
bank
services
involved?
the
banking
service
company,
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
they
do
it
again?
or
exceed
who
the
competitors
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it’s
a
bank.
it’s
right
it’s
a
bank.
what
are
the
bank
services
that
are
being
performed
that
they
object
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
data
processing?
justice

yes.
