mr.
bert
m.
gross
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
present
case,
this
court
is
called
upon
to
resolve
a
direct
conflict
between
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
regarding
a
threshold
question
of
standing
to
sue.
now,
this
case
arose
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
minnesota
and
it
was
dismissed
upon
motion
and
before
trial
on
the
grounds
that
the
petitioners
lack
standing
to
maintain
this
litigation.
this
ruling
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
about
the
same
time,
a
substantially
identical
case
arose
in
rhode
island
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
reached
a
precisely
opposite
result
that
petitioners
in
that
case
do
have
standing
to
maintain
this
particular
type
of
litigation.
this
case
arose
from
the
eighth
circuit.
the
first
circuit
case
is
presently
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
limited
to
the
complaint
because
the
case
was
dismissed
on
motion
prior
to
trial
or
pretrial.
the
petitioners
were
the
plaintiffs
and
they
are
the
association
of
data
processing
service
organizations,
which
is
a
trade
association
of
businesses
engaged
in
rendering
data
processing
services
to
the
general
business
community.
the
other
petitioner
is
data
systems
incorporated,
a
minnesota
corporation,
a
member
of
the
association,
which
is
referred
to
as
adapso
and
data
systems
is
engaged
in
rendering
data
processing
services
in
the
minnesota.
respondents
are
the
american
national
bank
and
trust
company
of
st.
paul,
a
national
bank
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
the
facts
alleged
that
data
system
was
engaged
in
the
data
processing
business
in
minnesota
and
that
the
american
national
bank
was
similarly
engaged
in
the
data
processing
business.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
data
systems
had
agreed
to
perform
certain
services
for
particular
customer,
it
later
turned
out
that
the
customer
began
doing
business
with
the
american
national
bank.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
action
of
the
american
national
bank
in
performing
data
processing
services
was
unlawful
and
that
it
violated
the
powers
given
national
banks
under
the
national
banking
laws.
the
complaint
asked
for
declaratory
relief
that
the
bank’s
action
was
unlawful.
it
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
it
asked
for
damages.
the
complaint
also
asked
for
declaratory
relief
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
was
acting
unlawfully
when
he
authorized
national
banks
to
engage
in
the
general
data
processing
business.
the
comptroller’s
authorization
is
found
on
page
2
of
petitioner’s
brief
and
it’s
in
a
paragraph
of
the
comptroller’s
manual
for
national
banks,
which
states
as
follows.
“incidental
to
its
banking
services,
a
national
bank
may
make
available
its
data
processing
equipment
or
perform
data
processing
services
on
such
equipment
for
other
banks
and
bank
customers.
the
last
three
words
that
if
the
banks
assume
authority
to
do
this
fatal
activity.
now,
in
our
brief
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
if
they
have
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
if
they
have
authority
under
the
acts
of
congress
your
honor,
they
would
not
need
the
specific
authorization.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that’s
correct,
the
question
is
statutory
authority.
in
our
brief,
we
raise
the
general
question
of
standing
to
sue.
we
have
discussed
the
so-called
the
legal
right
theory,
the
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
must
have
a
legal
right
to
have
standing
to
maintain
an
action
of
this
nature.
this
rule
was
probably
most
prominently
announced
in
the
case
of
tennessee
electric
power
versus
tva
in
306
united
states’
reports,
but
this
was
not
the
issue
that
divided
the
courts
of
appeals
where
the
first
and
the
eighth
circuit
and
i
would
turn
to
that
narrow
issue
which
did
divide
the
circuits
and
that’s
he
question
of
statutory
aid
to
standing.
the
rule
generally
maybe
stated
that
that
if
a
competitor
can
show
that
a
statute
was
intended
to
protect
his
competitive
or
economic
interest
then
he
has
standing
to
complain
of
unlawful
competition.
and
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
applicable
in
this
case,
and
that
statute
is
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
that’s
found
in
12
united
states
code,
section
1864
--
the
relevant
portion
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
2.
this
is
a
1962
statute.
it
is
therefore
extremely
important
to
examine
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
decide
the
scope
or
the
protection
before
the
data
processing
industry.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
is
undoubted,
it
was
to
allow
smaller
banks
to
achieve
more
effective
competition
against
larger
banks
by
joining
together
to
invest
in
bank
service
corporations
subsidiaries.
two
or
more
banks
that
can
now
join
together
to
form
a
bank
service
corporation
which
will
render
data
processing
services
for
the
banks
such
things
as
sorting
checks
and
reconciling
statements
that
sort
of
thing.
prior
to
1962,
it
was
felt
that
banks
could
not
invest
in
corporations
of
this
type.
so
the
basic
purpose
was
to
authorize
national
banks
to
join
together
in
this
function.
now,
the
question
that
properly
came
up
as
to
the
extent
that
bank
service
corporations
could
engage
in
the
general
data
processing
of
business.
and
the
compromise
or
result
reach
by
the
house
of
representatives
which
have
the
bill
initially
was
to
permit
bank
service
corporations
subsidiaries
to
perform
the
services
for
a
non-bank
customers
to
the
extent
of
one-half
of
their
total
activities,
but
not
to
exceed
one-half
of
their
total
activities
could
be
performed
for
a
non-bank
customers.
when
the
bill
got
to
the
senate,
certain
senators
were
not
satisfied
with
even
this
restriction
and
a
minority
report
was
issued
by
the
senate
banking
and
currency
commission
or
committee.
senators
proxmire,
neuberger
and
douglas
issued
the
report
criticizing
the
one-half
limitation
as
being
excessive,
that’s
found
on
our
brief
on
page
33.
excerpts
from
that
report,
i’ll
read
the
court
one
sentence
and
this
is
the
basic
point
of
the
minority
report.
they
stated
that
adequate
justification
has
not
been
demonstrated
for
extending
this
exemption
to
permit
banks
to
engage
in
the
business
of
data
processing
which
this
bill
permits
up
to
50%
of
the
total
activity
of
a
bank
service
corporation.
senator
proxmire
went
further.
he
introduced
an
amendment
on
the
florida
senate
to
prohibit
bank
service
corporations
totally
from
engaging
in
data
processing
services
for
non-bank
customers.
and
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
the
reasons
for
senator
proxmire’s
amendment.
he
was
perfectly
clear
on
the
reasons
and
they
were
to
protect
the
data
processing
industry.
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
we
have
quoted
from
certain
remarks
of
senator
proxmire
and
i’ll
read
a
few
sentences
so
that
the
court
can
see
exactly
what
the
senator
was
driving
at
with
his
amendment.
he
stated
that
banks
have
customer
lists
and
they
can
offer
their
customers
for
instance
for
service
of
handling
their
receivables
which
would
give
the
banks
a
substantial
advantage
over
other
legitimate
long
established
business
providing
this
kind
of
service.
a
number
of
these
businesses
have
informed
me
and
other
senators
that
this
kind
of
competition
would
be
very
unfair.
it
would
be
unfair
because
the
banks
could
use
their
own
personnel
charged
merely
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
the
unfair
competition
could
drive
businesses
now
offering
this
kind
of
service
to
the
(inaudible).
these
are
the
reasons
why
i
offered
this
amendment
with
the
adoption
of
the
amendment,
i
think
we
are
in
a
position
to
have
a
bill
that
provides
what
the
banks
really
want,
what
the
members
of
the
committee
feel
is
justified
and
at
the
same
time
safeguard
legitimate
business
enterprises
which
might
otherwise
be
put
out
of
business.
the
proxmire
amendment
passed
and
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
presently
enacted
in
the
law
states
as
follows:
no
bank
service
corporation
may
engage
in
any
activity
other
than
the
performance
of
bank
services
for
banks.
we
believe
that
this
case
requires
in
unique
fashion
and
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
so-called
statutory
aid
to
standing
a
doctrine.
in
previous
cases,
courts
have
been
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
a
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
if
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
competitive
interest,
then
the
court
held
that
the
protected
competitor
had
standing
to
maintain
his
litigation
on
the
merits.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
statute
for
constitutional
provision
was
not
so
designed
and
was
not
intended
to
offer
protection
to
competitive
interest,
then
the
competitors
were
held
not
to
have
standing.
or
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
that
is
not
occurred
before
to
the
best
of
our
research
and
the
respondents
cited
no
cases
showing
a
situation
where
there
is
an
undoubted
congressional
purpose
to
protect
a
competitive
interest,
but
from
a
source
of
competition
which
is
slightly
different
although
closely
related
to
the
actual
source
of
competition.
here,
we’re
dealing
with
competition
by
a
national
banks
themselves.
the
statute
according
to
its
words
was
--
says
that
no
bank
service
corporations
subsidiary
shall
engage
in
data
processing
activities.
so,
we
have
the
situation
where
it
appears
to
us
that
respondents
are
arguing
this
file.
assume
that
bank
a
and
bank
b
get
together
to
form
a
subsidiary
bank
service
corporation
act.
that
corporation
begins
to
engage
in
activities,
which
appear
to
be
data
processing
for
the
general
business
community.
in
that
situation,
we
must
assume
that
a
competitor
like
the
petitioner
has
standing.
however,
assume
that
bank
a
and
bank
b
instead
of
forming
a
subsidiary
corporation
decide
on
their
own
individually
to
offer
the
same
type
of
data
processing
services.
the
respondent
says,
“there
is
no
standing
because
there
is
no
statutory
aid
to
standing.”
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no
your
honor,
not
in
this
situation.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
a
case
would
go
back
for
trial.
now,
we
can
assume
that
even
further
where
the
bank
service
corporation
access
that
have
two
banks
get
together
to
form
the
subsidiary
on
one
bank
leaves
and
withdraws
that
the
other
bank
--
the
other
individual
bank
may
carry
on
with
the
bank
service
corporation.
so,
we
have
a
situation
of
one
bank
having
a
bank
service
corporation
subsidiary
which
if
it
engages
in
data
processing
activities
now
the
petitioners
can
attack.
and
yet,
if
the
parent
corporation
engages
in
the
self
same
activities,
there
is
no
standing
according
to
the
respondents.
we
feel
that
this
is
an
effort
by
the
banks
and
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
adopt
the
very
broad
and
expensive
interpretation
of
the
restrictive
doctrine
of
standing.
and
we
feel
that
they
are
pushing
the
doctrine
of
standing
beyond
any
reasonable
purpose.
the
rules
of
standing
have
the
effect
of
preventing
an
inquiry
into
the
merits
of
litigation.
and
we
feel
that
rules
that
have
this
effect
of
preventing
reaching
the
merits
should
be
rather
narrowly
and
restrictively
interpreted
and
in
close
cases,
the
doubt
should
be
resolve
in
favor
of
reaching
the
merits
particularly
where
the
merits
are
important
and
the
merits
are
important
and
not
this
type
of
bank
case
is
important
to
the
banks.
it’s
important
to
petitioners
and
it
has
important
implications.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
your
honor,
i
feel
that
flast
v.
cohen
shows
a
philosophy
of
standing
that
would
grant
standing
in
this
case.
the
facts
of
course
in
the
situation
are
different
but
flast
versus
cohen
has
a
philosophy
of
inquiring
into
the
personal
interest
of
the
petitioner.
it
inquires
into
the
concrete
adverseness
of
the
parties
whether
the
case
is
informed
in
appropriate
form
for
judicial
resolution
rather
than
seeking
to
find
some
undefined
legal
right.
if
you
look
at
the
factual
adverse
interest,
if
you
look
at
the
type
of
case,
if
you
look
at
our
case
through
the
view
flast
and
cohen
there
clearly
is
standing.
these
people
are
adverse
under
any
test,
petitioners
have
been
harmed
undeniably
at
this
juncture
of
the
case
they
have
been
harmed.
they
alleged
they’ve
been
harmed
and
their
complaint
was
dismissed
before
trial.
the
case
is
appropriate
for
a
judicial
treatment,
we
ask
for
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
congress.
we
think
the
competitors
in
this
situation
are
the
best
persons
to
try
the
merits
to
this
litigation
and
probably
the
only
persons,
we
feel
that
the
merits
it’s
unlikely
that
the
merits
will
ever
be
reach
if
a
competitor
does
not
bring
this
type
of
litigation.
so,
we
feel
that
under
flast
versus
cohen,
we
do
have
standing,
we
have
adversity,
we
have
this
personal
state,
we
have
a
concrete
case,
and
in
addition,
we
have
important
issues
on
the
merits
and
finally
we
have
a
statute
of
congress
where
congress
clearly
was
trying
to
protect
the
data
processing
industry
from
a
type
of
national
bank
competition.
this
is
what
the
first
circuit
felt
was
sufficient
for
standing
and
this
is
what
we
believe
this
sufficient
for
standing.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
not
under
the
narrow
scope
of
statutory
aid
to
standing
your
honor
under
the
broad
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no,
we
have
two
basic
issues
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
i
think
it
is
if
you
overrule
about
three
to
four
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
your
honor
and
in
our
brief
we
have
set
forth
that
rather
extensively.
and
we
don’t
believe
that
tennessee
electric
power
is
an
adequate
type
of
case
and
adequate
determination
of
this
issue.
we
think
it
should
be
a
bond.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
following
tennessee
electric
power,
we
think
we
have
standing
under
the
doctrine
of
statutory
aid
to
standing.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that’s
the
only
statute
we
rely
on,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
bears
on
this
issue
too
--
in
part.
now,
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
apa
are
familiar.
it
reads
that
a
person
suffering
legal
wrong
because
of
agency
action
or
adversely
affected
or
agreed
by
agency
action
within
the
meaning
of
a
relevant
statute
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
there.
we
feel
that
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
a
relevant
statute
under
the
apa
and
we
think
that
reading
the
apa
in
conjunction
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act
there
certainly
is
standing.
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
relevant
because
it
bears
on
this
problem,
it
was
an
undoubted
congressional,
a
response
or
effort
to
protect
data
processors.
for
this
reason,
we
feel
it
is
relevant.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
the
first
circuit
was
after
the
eight
circuit,
yes.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
it
was
your
honor.
it
was
addressed
in
our
brief
and
further
prominently
displayed.
it
was
not
argued
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
in
a
footnote,
your
honor.
so,
we
feel
that
under
the
bank
service
corporation
act
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
not
along
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
that
act
read
in
conjunction
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
there
are
certainly
is
enough
congressional
protection
afforded
to
data
processors
to
give
them
standing
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
thank
you.
if
the
court
please,
we
cannot
agree
that
assuming
that
we
have
standing
to
challenge
the
action
of
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
a
national
bank
that
we
do
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
identical
activity
of
the
national
bank
itself.
we
think
that
that
cuts
the
doctrine
of
standing
too
fine.
as
far
as
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act,
the
respondents
have
stated
that
we
only
have
senator
proxmire
statements
as
to
the
purpose
for
section
4.
but
of
course
senator
proxmire
introduced
this
section,
he
explicitly
stated
his
reasons
for
doing
so
on
and
it
was
passed.
there
is
another
statement
which
we
have
quoted
in
the
footnote
on
our
brief
at
page
35
and
this
is
from
senator
bush.
senator
bush
said,
“i
join
with
the
senator
that
is
senator
proxmire
in
supporting
the
bill.
i
think
the
senator’s
amendment
is
well
taken.
i
think
it
is
advisable
to
try
the
situation
out
at
the
bank
level
before
we
authorize
banks
to
go
into
competition
with
other
service
organizations
in
providing
the
type
of
service
kind
contemplated
here.”
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no,
senator
bush
is
saying
that
again
that
we
should
not
authorize
banks
to
go
into
competition.
we’re
presenting
this
only
for
a
statement
of
the
interest
that
was
trying
to
be
protected
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
and
this
is
what
gives
the
standing,
it
is
the
congressional
intent
or
purpose
to
protect
competitive
interest
which
gives
the
standing
and
we
do
not
go
into
the
merits
at
this
time.
as
far
as
reaching
the
merits
of
the
case
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
merits
will
ever
be
reached
and
who
can
reach
the
merits
if
we
cannot.
we
frankly
do
not
think
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
the
--
is
an
adequate
person
to
reach
the
merits
to
this
situation.
number
one,
he
has
already
decided
that
the
banks
do
have
authority
under
the
statute.
secondly,
and
in
a
broader
sense,
there
have
been
recently
in
the
court
of
appeals
six
cases
regarding
entry
by
a
national
banks
into
various
areas
of
business
endeavor
which
have
not
previously
been
considered
traditional
banking
areas.
from
these
six
cases,
four
cases
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
standing,
two
they
held
no
standing.
of
the
three
cases
that
actually
reached
the
merits,
two
of
the
three
held
that
bank
action
was
illegal
and
all
these
cases,
this
action
was
authorized
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
so,
on
the
merits
the
comptroller
is
banning
one
out
of
three
and
the
legality
of
bank
actions
and
on
these
grounds,
we
think
that
judicial
review
is
needed
and
this
is
a
traditional
function
of
the
courts
to
decide
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
for
these
reasons,
we
repeat
that
we
feel
we
do
have
standing
in
this
case.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
present
case,
this
court
is
called
upon
to
resolve
a
direct
conflict
between
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
regarding
a
threshold
question
of
standing
to
sue.
now,
this
case
arose
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
minnesota
and
it
was
dismissed
upon
motion
and
before
trial
on
the
grounds
that
the
petitioners
lack
standing
to
maintain
this
litigation.
this
ruling
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
about
the
same
time,
a
substantially
identical
case
arose
in
rhode
island
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
reached
a
precisely
opposite
result
that
petitioners
in
that
case
do
have
standing
to
maintain
this
particular
type
of
litigation.
this
case
arose
from
the
eighth
circuit.
the
first
circuit
case
is
presently
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
limited
to
the
complaint
because
the
case
was
dismissed
on
motion
prior
to
trial
or
pretrial.
the
petitioners
were
the
plaintiffs
and
they
are
the
association
of
data
processing
service
organizations,
which
is
a
trade
association
of
businesses
engaged
in
rendering
data
processing
services
to
the
general
business
community.
the
other
petitioner
is
data
systems
incorporated,
a
minnesota
corporation,
a
member
of
the
association,
which
is
referred
to
as
adapso
and
data
systems
is
engaged
in
rendering
data
processing
services
in
the
minnesota.
respondents
are
the
american
national
bank
and
trust
company
of
st.
paul,
a
national
bank
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
the
facts
alleged
that
data
system
was
engaged
in
the
data
processing
business
in
minnesota
and
that
the
american
national
bank
was
similarly
engaged
in
the
data
processing
business.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
data
systems
had
agreed
to
perform
certain
services
for
particular
customer,
it
later
turned
out
that
the
customer
began
doing
business
with
the
american
national
bank.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
action
of
the
american
national
bank
in
performing
data
processing
services
was
unlawful
and
that
it
violated
the
powers
given
national
banks
under
the
national
banking
laws.
the
complaint
asked
for
declaratory
relief
that
the
bank’s
action
was
unlawful.
it
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
it
asked
for
damages.
the
complaint
also
asked
for
declaratory
relief
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
was
acting
unlawfully
when
he
authorized
national
banks
to
engage
in
the
general
data
processing
business.
the
comptroller’s
authorization
is
found
on
page
2
of
petitioner’s
brief
and
it’s
in
a
paragraph
of
the
comptroller’s
manual
for
national
banks,
which
states
as
follows.
“incidental
to
its
banking
services,
a
national
bank
may
make
available
its
data
processing
equipment
or
perform
data
processing
services
on
such
equipment
for
other
banks
and
bank
customers.
the
last
three
words
that
if
the
banks
assume
authority
to
do
this
fatal
activity.
now,
in
our
brief
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
if
they
have
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
if
they
have
authority
under
the
acts
of
congress
your
honor,
they
would
not
need
the
specific
authorization.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that’s
correct,
the
question
is
statutory
authority.
in
our
brief,
we
raise
the
general
question
of
standing
to
sue.
we
have
discussed
the
so-called
the
legal
right
theory,
the
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
must
have
a
legal
right
to
have
standing
to
maintain
an
action
of
this
nature.
this
rule
was
probably
most
prominently
announced
in
the
case
of
tennessee
electric
power
versus
tva
in
306
united
states’
reports,
but
this
was
not
the
issue
that
divided
the
courts
of
appeals
where
the
first
and
the
eighth
circuit
and
i
would
turn
to
that
narrow
issue
which
did
divide
the
circuits
and
that’s
he
question
of
statutory
aid
to
standing.
the
rule
generally
maybe
stated
that
that
if
a
competitor
can
show
that
a
statute
was
intended
to
protect
his
competitive
or
economic
interest
then
he
has
standing
to
complain
of
unlawful
competition.
and
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
applicable
in
this
case,
and
that
statute
is
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
that’s
found
in
12
united
states
code,
section
1864
--
the
relevant
portion
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
2.
this
is
a
1962
statute.
it
is
therefore
extremely
important
to
examine
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
decide
the
scope
or
the
protection
before
the
data
processing
industry.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
is
undoubted,
it
was
to
allow
smaller
banks
to
achieve
more
effective
competition
against
larger
banks
by
joining
together
to
invest
in
bank
service
corporations
subsidiaries.
two
or
more
banks
that
can
now
join
together
to
form
a
bank
service
corporation
which
will
render
data
processing
services
for
the
banks
such
things
as
sorting
checks
and
reconciling
statements
that
sort
of
thing.
prior
to
1962,
it
was
felt
that
banks
could
not
invest
in
corporations
of
this
type.
so
the
basic
purpose
was
to
authorize
national
banks
to
join
together
in
this
function.
now,
the
question
that
properly
came
up
as
to
the
extent
that
bank
service
corporations
could
engage
in
the
general
data
processing
of
business.
and
the
compromise
or
result
reach
by
the
house
of
representatives
which
have
the
bill
initially
was
to
permit
bank
service
corporations
subsidiaries
to
perform
the
services
for
a
non-bank
customers
to
the
extent
of
one-half
of
their
total
activities,
but
not
to
exceed
one-half
of
their
total
activities
could
be
performed
for
a
non-bank
customers.
when
the
bill
got
to
the
senate,
certain
senators
were
not
satisfied
with
even
this
restriction
and
a
minority
report
was
issued
by
the
senate
banking
and
currency
commission
or
committee.
senators
proxmire,
neuberger
and
douglas
issued
the
report
criticizing
the
one-half
limitation
as
being
excessive,
that’s
found
on
our
brief
on
page
33.
excerpts
from
that
report,
i’ll
read
the
court
one
sentence
and
this
is
the
basic
point
of
the
minority
report.
they
stated
that
adequate
justification
has
not
been
demonstrated
for
extending
this
exemption
to
permit
banks
to
engage
in
the
business
of
data
processing
which
this
bill
permits
up
to
50%
of
the
total
activity
of
a
bank
service
corporation.
senator
proxmire
went
further.
he
introduced
an
amendment
on
the
florida
senate
to
prohibit
bank
service
corporations
totally
from
engaging
in
data
processing
services
for
non-bank
customers.
and
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
the
reasons
for
senator
proxmire’s
amendment.
he
was
perfectly
clear
on
the
reasons
and
they
were
to
protect
the
data
processing
industry.
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
we
have
quoted
from
certain
remarks
of
senator
proxmire
and
i’ll
read
a
few
sentences
so
that
the
court
can
see
exactly
what
the
senator
was
driving
at
with
his
amendment.
he
stated
that
banks
have
customer
lists
and
they
can
offer
their
customers
for
instance
for
service
of
handling
their
receivables
which
would
give
the
banks
a
substantial
advantage
over
other
legitimate
long
established
business
providing
this
kind
of
service.
a
number
of
these
businesses
have
informed
me
and
other
senators
that
this
kind
of
competition
would
be
very
unfair.
it
would
be
unfair
because
the
banks
could
use
their
own
personnel
charged
merely
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
the
unfair
competition
could
drive
businesses
now
offering
this
kind
of
service
to
the
(inaudible).
these
are
the
reasons
why
i
offered
this
amendment
with
the
adoption
of
the
amendment,
i
think
we
are
in
a
position
to
have
a
bill
that
provides
what
the
banks
really
want,
what
the
members
of
the
committee
feel
is
justified
and
at
the
same
time
safeguard
legitimate
business
enterprises
which
might
otherwise
be
put
out
of
business.
the
proxmire
amendment
passed
and
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
presently
enacted
in
the
law
states
as
follows:
no
bank
service
corporation
may
engage
in
any
activity
other
than
the
performance
of
bank
services
for
banks.
we
believe
that
this
case
requires
in
unique
fashion
and
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
the
so-called
statutory
aid
to
standing
a
doctrine.
in
previous
cases,
courts
have
been
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
a
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
if
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
the
competitive
interest,
then
the
court
held
that
the
protected
competitor
had
standing
to
maintain
his
litigation
on
the
merits.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
statute
for
constitutional
provision
was
not
so
designed
and
was
not
intended
to
offer
protection
to
competitive
interest,
then
the
competitors
were
held
not
to
have
standing.
or
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
that
is
not
occurred
before
to
the
best
of
our
research
and
the
respondents
cited
no
cases
showing
a
situation
where
there
is
an
undoubted
congressional
purpose
to
protect
a
competitive
interest,
but
from
a
source
of
competition
which
is
slightly
different
although
closely
related
to
the
actual
source
of
competition.
here,
we’re
dealing
with
competition
by
a
national
banks
themselves.
the
statute
according
to
its
words
was
--
says
that
no
bank
service
corporations
subsidiary
shall
engage
in
data
processing
activities.
so,
we
have
the
situation
where
it
appears
to
us
that
respondents
are
arguing
this
file.
assume
that
bank
a
and
bank
b
get
together
to
form
a
subsidiary
bank
service
corporation
act.
that
corporation
begins
to
engage
in
activities,
which
appear
to
be
data
processing
for
the
general
business
community.
in
that
situation,
we
must
assume
that
a
competitor
like
the
petitioner
has
standing.
however,
assume
that
bank
a
and
bank
b
instead
of
forming
a
subsidiary
corporation
decide
on
their
own
individually
to
offer
the
same
type
of
data
processing
services.
the
respondent
says,
“there
is
no
standing
because
there
is
no
statutory
aid
to
standing.”
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no
your
honor,
not
in
this
situation.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
a
case
would
go
back
for
trial.
now,
we
can
assume
that
even
further
where
the
bank
service
corporation
access
that
have
two
banks
get
together
to
form
the
subsidiary
on
one
bank
leaves
and
withdraws
that
the
other
bank
--
the
other
individual
bank
may
carry
on
with
the
bank
service
corporation.
so,
we
have
a
situation
of
one
bank
having
a
bank
service
corporation
subsidiary
which
if
it
engages
in
data
processing
activities
now
the
petitioners
can
attack.
and
yet,
if
the
parent
corporation
engages
in
the
self
same
activities,
there
is
no
standing
according
to
the
respondents.
we
feel
that
this
is
an
effort
by
the
banks
and
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
adopt
the
very
broad
and
expensive
interpretation
of
the
restrictive
doctrine
of
standing.
and
we
feel
that
they
are
pushing
the
doctrine
of
standing
beyond
any
reasonable
purpose.
the
rules
of
standing
have
the
effect
of
preventing
an
inquiry
into
the
merits
of
litigation.
and
we
feel
that
rules
that
have
this
effect
of
preventing
reaching
the
merits
should
be
rather
narrowly
and
restrictively
interpreted
and
in
close
cases,
the
doubt
should
be
resolve
in
favor
of
reaching
the
merits
particularly
where
the
merits
are
important
and
the
merits
are
important
and
not
this
type
of
bank
case
is
important
to
the
banks.
it’s
important
to
petitioners
and
it
has
important
implications.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
your
honor,
i
feel
that
flast
v.
cohen
shows
a
philosophy
of
standing
that
would
grant
standing
in
this
case.
the
facts
of
course
in
the
situation
are
different
but
flast
versus
cohen
has
a
philosophy
of
inquiring
into
the
personal
interest
of
the
petitioner.
it
inquires
into
the
concrete
adverseness
of
the
parties
whether
the
case
is
informed
in
appropriate
form
for
judicial
resolution
rather
than
seeking
to
find
some
undefined
legal
right.
if
you
look
at
the
factual
adverse
interest,
if
you
look
at
the
type
of
case,
if
you
look
at
our
case
through
the
view
flast
and
cohen
there
clearly
is
standing.
these
people
are
adverse
under
any
test,
petitioners
have
been
harmed
undeniably
at
this
juncture
of
the
case
they
have
been
harmed.
they
alleged
they’ve
been
harmed
and
their
complaint
was
dismissed
before
trial.
the
case
is
appropriate
for
a
judicial
treatment,
we
ask
for
the
interpretation
of
a
statute
of
congress.
we
think
the
competitors
in
this
situation
are
the
best
persons
to
try
the
merits
to
this
litigation
and
probably
the
only
persons,
we
feel
that
the
merits
it’s
unlikely
that
the
merits
will
ever
be
reach
if
a
competitor
does
not
bring
this
type
of
litigation.
so,
we
feel
that
under
flast
versus
cohen,
we
do
have
standing,
we
have
adversity,
we
have
this
personal
state,
we
have
a
concrete
case,
and
in
addition,
we
have
important
issues
on
the
merits
and
finally
we
have
a
statute
of
congress
where
congress
clearly
was
trying
to
protect
the
data
processing
industry
from
a
type
of
national
bank
competition.
this
is
what
the
first
circuit
felt
was
sufficient
for
standing
and
this
is
what
we
believe
this
sufficient
for
standing.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
not
under
the
narrow
scope
of
statutory
aid
to
standing
your
honor
under
the
broad
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no,
we
have
two
basic
issues
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
i
think
it
is
if
you
overrule
about
three
to
four
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
your
honor
and
in
our
brief
we
have
set
forth
that
rather
extensively.
and
we
don’t
believe
that
tennessee
electric
power
is
an
adequate
type
of
case
and
adequate
determination
of
this
issue.
we
think
it
should
be
a
bond.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
following
tennessee
electric
power,
we
think
we
have
standing
under
the
doctrine
of
statutory
aid
to
standing.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that’s
the
only
statute
we
rely
on,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
bears
on
this
issue
too
--
in
part.
now,
the
judicial
review
provisions
of
the
apa
are
familiar.
it
reads
that
a
person
suffering
legal
wrong
because
of
agency
action
or
adversely
affected
or
agreed
by
agency
action
within
the
meaning
of
a
relevant
statute
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
there.
we
feel
that
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
a
relevant
statute
under
the
apa
and
we
think
that
reading
the
apa
in
conjunction
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act
there
certainly
is
standing.
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
relevant
because
it
bears
on
this
problem,
it
was
an
undoubted
congressional,
a
response
or
effort
to
protect
data
processors.
for
this
reason,
we
feel
it
is
relevant.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
the
first
circuit
was
after
the
eight
circuit,
yes.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
it
was
your
honor.
it
was
addressed
in
our
brief
and
further
prominently
displayed.
it
was
not
argued
--
mr.
bert
m.
gross
in
a
footnote,
your
honor.
so,
we
feel
that
under
the
bank
service
corporation
act
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
not
along
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
that
act
read
in
conjunction
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
there
are
certainly
is
enough
congressional
protection
afforded
to
data
processors
to
give
them
standing
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
bert
m.
gross
thank
you.
if
the
court
please,
we
cannot
agree
that
assuming
that
we
have
standing
to
challenge
the
action
of
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
a
national
bank
that
we
do
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
identical
activity
of
the
national
bank
itself.
we
think
that
that
cuts
the
doctrine
of
standing
too
fine.
as
far
as
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act,
the
respondents
have
stated
that
we
only
have
senator
proxmire
statements
as
to
the
purpose
for
section
4.
but
of
course
senator
proxmire
introduced
this
section,
he
explicitly
stated
his
reasons
for
doing
so
on
and
it
was
passed.
there
is
another
statement
which
we
have
quoted
in
the
footnote
on
our
brief
at
page
35
and
this
is
from
senator
bush.
senator
bush
said,
“i
join
with
the
senator
that
is
senator
proxmire
in
supporting
the
bill.
i
think
the
senator’s
amendment
is
well
taken.
i
think
it
is
advisable
to
try
the
situation
out
at
the
bank
level
before
we
authorize
banks
to
go
into
competition
with
other
service
organizations
in
providing
the
type
of
service
kind
contemplated
here.”
mr.
bert
m.
gross
no,
senator
bush
is
saying
that
again
that
we
should
not
authorize
banks
to
go
into
competition.
we’re
presenting
this
only
for
a
statement
of
the
interest
that
was
trying
to
be
protected
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
and
this
is
what
gives
the
standing,
it
is
the
congressional
intent
or
purpose
to
protect
competitive
interest
which
gives
the
standing
and
we
do
not
go
into
the
merits
at
this
time.
as
far
as
reaching
the
merits
of
the
case
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
merits
will
ever
be
reached
and
who
can
reach
the
merits
if
we
cannot.
we
frankly
do
not
think
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
the
--
is
an
adequate
person
to
reach
the
merits
to
this
situation.
number
one,
he
has
already
decided
that
the
banks
do
have
authority
under
the
statute.
secondly,
and
in
a
broader
sense,
there
have
been
recently
in
the
court
of
appeals
six
cases
regarding
entry
by
a
national
banks
into
various
areas
of
business
endeavor
which
have
not
previously
been
considered
traditional
banking
areas.
from
these
six
cases,
four
cases
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
standing,
two
they
held
no
standing.
of
the
three
cases
that
actually
reached
the
merits,
two
of
the
three
held
that
bank
action
was
illegal
and
all
these
cases,
this
action
was
authorized
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
so,
on
the
merits
the
comptroller
is
banning
one
out
of
three
and
the
legality
of
bank
actions
and
on
these
grounds,
we
think
that
judicial
review
is
needed
and
this
is
a
traditional
function
of
the
courts
to
decide
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
for
these
reasons,
we
repeat
that
we
feel
we
do
have
standing
in
this
case.
