mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
over
a
period
of
almost
90
years
beginning
with
its
decision
in
1882
when
railroad
company
against
ellerman.
this
court
has
consistently
in
here
to
rule
that
where
as
is
concededly
the
case
here.
there
is
no
special
statutory
provision
for
judicial
review.
the
complainant
seeking
to
attack
governmental
action
which
does
no
more
than
increase
competition
against
him
or
show
that
he
possesses
a
legally
protective
right
to
be
free
from
that
competition,
now
the
court
has
further
made
it
clear
that
it
is
also
true
in
this
case.
no
such
legally
protected
right
is
conferred
by
license
or
franchise.
the
plaintiff
must
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
as
this
court
put
it
just
two
terms
ago
in
hardin
against
kentucky
utilities.
the
particular
statutory
provision
invoked
reflects
a
legislative
purpose
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
if
but
only
if
such
a
purpose
appears
to
again
call
it
from
hardin,
the
injured
competitor
has
standing
to
require
compliance
with
that
provision.
now,
notwithstanding
the
present
reliance
petitioners
upon
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
few
minutes.
the
fact
remains
that
its
complaint
invoked
only
the
incidental
powers
clause
of
the
national
bank
act.
provision
of
12
u.s.c.
247
which
authorizes
national
banks
to
exercise
“such
incidental
powers
shall
be
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
of
banking.”
specifically,
as
petitioner’s
complaint
reflects
their
attack
upon
the
comptroller’s
ruling
that
national
banks
may
provide
data
processing
services
to
other
banks
and
bank
customers
was
based
exclusively
on
the
proposition
that
such
services
do
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the
incidental
powers
clause.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
it
is
fatal
mr.
justice
harlan
from
this
point
of
view
for
the
reason
that
they
cannot
as
they
do
not
assert
that
the
conduct
which
they
are
seeking
to
enjoin
violates
any
statute
but
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
is
the
matter
your
honor
of
a
pleading
defect.
the
point
is
that
their
complaint
alleges
a
violation
of
the
national
bank
act
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
that
is
the
only
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
which
they
could
claim
have
been
violated,
it
wasn’t
that
any
inadvertent
failure
to
allege
a
violation
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
what
i'm
saying
your
honor
is
that
they
seek
to
base
their
claim
of
standing
upon
a
statute
which
they
cannot
claim
has
been
violated.
that’s
essentially
what
it
comes
down
to
and
not
only
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
our
position
is
that
they
lack
standing
irrespective
of
whether
the
national
bank
act
precludes
banks
from
engaging
in
the
activity
which
they
seek
to
enjoin.
our
position
rests
upon
this
proposition
that
even
if
it
could
be
said
on
the
merits
that
section
247
precludes
the
activity
of
which
they
complain,
the
fact
remains
that
section
247
was
not
enacted
to
protect
any
competitive
interest
of
these
petitioners
or
any
other
potential
competitors
of
national
banks.
and
that
for
this
reason
under
the
federal
standing
doctrine,
ellerman,
tennessee
power
v.
tva,
the
hardin
case
is
the
last
expression
of
the
court
that
they
lack
standing
that
they
would
only
have
standing
if
they
could
show
not
merely
that
the
statute
was
violated
but
then
it
was
intended
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
over
theirs.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
in
the
circumstances
--
present
circumstances,
the
action
on
the
part
of
a
bank
in
violation
of
the
act
could
be
challenged
by
bank’s
supervisory
authorities.
it
is
possible
that
with
respect
to
some
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
which
might
have
been
designed
to
protect
possibly
the
solvency
of
banks
that
their
depositors
or
customers
might
have
a
standing
--
or
shareholders.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
so
if
the
shareholder
again
could
establish
as
i
think
he
would
very
like
to
be
able
to
in
many
instances
at
least
that
the
provision
which
was
being
violated
by
the
bank
was
intended
to
ensure
the
solvency
of
the
bank.
additionally,
if
your
honor
pleases,
any
time
that
the
congress
sees
fit
to
insert
in
this
statute
a
person
aggrieved
provision.
review
would
be
available
at
the
behest
of
people
who
would
qualify
as
persons
aggrieved.
the
congress
has
not
chosen
to
close
these
petitioners
with
the
status
of
essentially
private
attorneys
general.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
there
are
areas
--
many
areas
in
which
the
superintendence
of
compliance
with
statutory
mandates
rest
with
the
congress
itself.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
in
this
instance
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
your
honor
with
respect
to
this
particular
provision
there
are
few
individuals
would
have
standing
to
attack
the
provision.
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
stockholders
well
might
but
certainly
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
i
would
think
it’s
quite
possible
the
stockholders
would
but
in
the
realm
of
competitors,
the
realm
of
individuals
such
as
these
petitioners
who
are
complaining
of
competitive
activity
in
the
part
of
the
banks.
their
remedy
lies
with
the
congress
to
which
they
have
gone
repeatedly.
but
before
and
after,
the
passage
of
the
bank
service
corporation
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
precisely
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
--
again
the
adapso
itself
has
been
before
the
congress.
it
has
sought
after
the
bank
service
corporation
act
was
passed
to
have
congress
specifically
preclude
data
processing
service
activities
on
the
part
of
banks
except
as
they
related
to
the
internal
operations
of
the
bank.
they
have
also
called
the
congress’
attention,
the
absence
of
a
judicial
review
provision
and
the
necessity
for
such
a
provision.
and
to
this
point
those
pleas
have
fallen
on
deaf
ears.
now,
we
say
it
is
quite
appropriate
for
the
congress
to
decide
whereas
here
there
is
no
legally
protective
right
of
the
petitioners
being
invaded
appropriate
to
the
congress
to
decide,
the
extent
to
which
it
wishes
to
deputize
these
petitioners
or
any
other
class
as
private
attorney’s
general
to
enforce
what
they
say
is
the
public
interest
and
compliance
with
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor.
it’s
my
--
if
congress
had
done
this
for
the
protection
of
competitors
then
under
the
established
standing
doctrine,
the
latest
decision
being
your
honor’s
decision
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
hardin,
but
we
insist
if
the
court
pleases
that
the
restriction
which
they
seek
to
enforce
--
the
restriction
of
the
national
bank
act
was
not
intended
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
and
indeed
they
don’t
argue
to
the
contrary,
they
have
never
suggested
either
on
the
lower
courts
or
in
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
their
contention
is
that
in
the
bank
service
corporation
act
specifically
with
relation
to
section
4
of
that
act
that
congress
manifested
an
intent
to
protect
data
processors
from
the
kind
of
competition
of
which
their
complaining.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
that’s
not
my
argument
your
honor.
if
the
bank
service
corporation
act
in
this
legislative
history
manifested
a
congressional
intent
to
protect
data
processing
service
companies
from
competition
on
the
part
of
national
banks,
then
i
would
certainly
agree
that
under
the
teachings
of
this
court
is
recently
again
in
the
hardin
case
standing
what
exist.
what
we
say
is
that
the
--
there
isn’t
a
job
or
syllable
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
indicate
any
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
bank
service
corporations
from
the
competition
of
which
they
are
complaining
here.
now,
the
legislative
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
only
extent
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
bank
service
corporation
act
begin
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
suggest
that
we
did
not
need
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
controversy
because
the
merits
are
of
course
are
in
terms
of
an
alleged
violation
of
the
national
bank
act.
and
it’s
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question
whether
or
not
the
national
bank
act
has
been
violated
in
order
to
decide
standing.
now,
with
respect
to
the
bank
service
corporation
act,
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
to
examine
this
legislative
history
and
to
determine
whether
the
congress
was
intending
by
that
act
to
any
extent
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
of
data
processing
service
companies
against
national
bank
competition.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
this
was
an
attack
upon
a
bank
service
corporation
activity,
i
think
the
standing
question
would
be
much
closer.
i
say
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
for
this
reason.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
because
the
only
statement
in
the
entire
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
which
manifested
any
concern
for
the
protection
of
data
processors
was
the
statement
on
the
floor
by
senator
proxmire.
now,
this
court
has
questioned
before
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
provision
itself
could
have
been
for
many
different
reasons.
in
the
congressional
mind,
the
provision
itself
might
have
been
a
gain
because
of
the
feeling
that
bank
service
corporations
in
the
general
public
interest
without
relation
to
any
specific
competitive
rule
should
not
be
engaging
in
activities
other
than
the
providing
of
bank
services
to
banks.
there’s
no
way
of
really
telling
what
of
many
possible
approaches
there
might
have
been,
but
this
much
is
clear.
we’re
dealing
with
national
banks
here,
congress
in
connection
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act
both
banking
and
currency
committees,
both
the
committee
in
the
house
and
the
committee
in
the
senate
were
specifically
apprised
of
the
fact
that
national
banks
were
engaged
in
this
activity.
now,
if
there
was
some
concern
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
what
is
the
bank
service
corporation
itself?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there’s
no
bank
service
corporation
involved
in
the
present
case
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
bank
services
--
well,
what
they
seek
to
enjoin
as
being
outside
of
the
scope
of
247
is
the
providing
of
data
processing
services
to
customers
of
the
bank.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
with
what
kind
of
services?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
they
would
include
for
example
putting
a
company’s
payroll
through
a
computer.
it’s
the
kind
of
record
in
the
bookkeeping
type
of
services
which
today
are
provided
in
most
up-to-date
business
establishments
signed
an
automated
basis.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
the
--
getting
back
if
i
may
just
for
minute
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
had
there
been
this
concern
that
petitioners
insist
existing
regarding
competition
on
the
part
of
banks
themselves
--
the
national
banks
in
particular
with
data
processing
service
companies,
that
section
4
would
not
have
been
cast
as
it
is
solely
in
terms
of
bank
service
corporations
but
what
have
embraced
banks
as
well.
an
important
fact,
section
5
of
the
act
does
deal
with
banks
in
a
completely
of
course
unrelated
context.
now,
we
see
and
think
it
is
very
difficult
for
petitioners
to
seriously
argue
here.
even
though
the
statute
which
they
claim
is
being
violated,
the
only
statute
national
bank
act
was
not
intended
for
their
protection
and
i
admit
this,
implicitly
at
least,
that
they
have
standing
to
complain
violations
of
the
national
bank
act
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
which
is
on
its
face
does
not
apply
to
bank
service
corporations.
circumstances
where
the
congress
that
both
congressional
committees
were
informed
the
banks
were
engaging
in
this
activity
and
not
only
does
the
act
not
refer
to
banks
in
this
context,
but
there
wasn’t
one
single
suggestion
and
the
committee
reports
of
either
committee
that
this
was
an
activity
which
should
be
legislated
the
case.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
motivation
for
the
act?
it
was
considered
in
1962
both
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
the
federal
reserve
board
that
a
bank
was
precluded,
absolutely
precluded
from
owning
stock
in
another
corporation.
the
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
was
to
enable
banks
to
invest
to
these
bank
service
corporations
so
that
banks
particularly
small
ones
could
combine
to
obtain
the
advantage
of
among
other
things
automated
facilities
which
individually
they
could
not
have
purchased.
the
whole
basis
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
motivation
of
the
act
indeed
was
to
provide
assistance
to
banks
not
to
impose
any
kind
of
restrictions
that
were
not
already
there.
and
i
think
that
representative
malter
who
is
a
senior
member
of
the
banking
of
currency
committee
really
admonished
against
the
kind
of
approach
which
the
petitioners
advance
here
and
the
quotation
which
appears
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american
bank
association
on
page
12.
i
won’t
read
the
quote,
but
he
specifically
indicates
that
he
wants
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
this
bill
was
not
intended
to
go
outside
the
very
language
appearing
in
the
bill
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
it
will
not
interfere
with
any
authority
now
invested
in
banks
and
that
it
simply
sets
up
a
new
means
by
which
individual
banks
can
acquire
these
additional
services.
now,
it
was
in
part
in
parcel
of
the
conferral
of
this
benefit
upon
banks
if
this
restriction
was
put
in
which
was
--
limits
the
bank
service
corporation
to
performing
bank
services
for
banks.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
may
have
been
that
it
was
initially
spearheaded
by
that
rule,
but
i
think
your
honor
pleases
that
the
actual
motivation
of
the
congressional
adoption
of
this
provision
was
to
just
get
that
bank
service
corporation
act
through,
it’s
a
form
of
compromise
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
indication
of
beyond
the
senator
proxmire
of
an
interest
in
data
processing
service
companies.
but
even
so
the
interest
was
reflected
only
in
the
context
of
the
activities
of
the
bank
service
corporation
itself.
now,
i
wish
to
stress
again
that
as
said
out
in
some
length
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bank
association
there
have
been
several
bills
for
the
congress
since
1962
in
which
they
--
there
has
been
in
connection
with
which
there
has
been
a
request
usually
spearheaded
by
adapso
that
there
be
a
prohibition
directly
impose
on
banks
with
respect
to
data
processing
service
activities.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
committee
reports,
i
don’t
recall
mr.
chief
justice
whether
there
is
a
specific
statement
in
the
committee
reports
to
that
effect.
but
the
whole
thrust
of
the
reports
of
the
two
houses,
the
majority
views
particularly
i
wish
to
stress
that
the
petitioner
is
here
from
the
statement
which
i
quote
from
the
supplemental
minority
views
that
they
according
from
a
minority
view
and
even
there
it
doesn’t
go
in
really
to
the
matter
of
protection
competitors
but
simply
solvency.
but
the
whole
thrust
really
the
majority
views
of
the
two
committees
is
that
this
is
an
act
which
is
designed
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
bank
service
corporations
and
not
in
any
other
area.
and
we
think
that
it
is
really
is
not
appropriate
basis
for
carrying
over
this
statute
into
another
area
and
allowing
it
to
be
used
as
a
statutory
aid
standing
to
question
activity
under
a
statute
which
was
not
intended
to
protect
the
competitor
who
has
bring
the
challenge.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
i
suggested
that
possibility.
well,
i
meant
to
say
was
that
that
would
be
a
much
closer
case.
there,
if
they
well
might
be
found
to
have
standing.
and
on
the
other
hand,
there’s
an
argument
at
least
that
they
would
lack
standing.
it
was
not
a
gain
i
wish
to
stress
it’s
a
completely
different
situation
than
the
one
which
is
before
the
court
here
where
they
are
not
invoking
as
the
basis
of
complaint
of
the
legality
of
that
act,
some
other
statute.
now,
i
would
only
add
have
if
the
court
pleases
that
for
the
reasons
that
are
detailed
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
reason
why
this
court
should
suggest
--
excuse
me,
should
adopt
the
alternative
suggestion
of
petitioners
that
the
rule
of
ellerman,
tennessee
power,
and
hardin
be
discarded.
we
think
that
that
rule
does
not
as
petitioners
suggest
--
would
suggest
we
think
the
rule
does
not
leave
the
public
interest
unprotected.
we
think
what
it
does
do
is
leave
it
to
the
congress
inappropriately
so
to
determine
where
superintendence
of
the
administrative
action
should
be
when
those
circumstances
where
the
claimant
can
point
to
the
invasion
of
no
legally
protected
right.
we
think
that
fundamentally
what
the
role
of
the
court
is
--
the
proper
role
of
the
court
is
the
--
that
of
a
guardian
of
legally
protected
rights
and
interests.
we
think
that
outside
of
that
realm,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
congress
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
it
wishes
the
courts
to
extend
judicial
review
to
those
who’s
like
these
petitioners
it
can
claim
solely
aggrieved
in
the
fact.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
flast
and
cohen
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
believe
to
be
fully
consistent
with
the
standing
cases
upon
which
we
rely.
in
flast
and
cohen
--
against
cohen,
this
court
held
that
in
so
far
as
the
article
3
requirement
of
the
case
of
controversy
is
concerned
that
it
was
enough
that
there
be
a
substantial
personal
state.
but
the
court
there
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
there
was
obviously
a
legal
right
involved
as
the
court
construed
the
first
amendment.
they
--
that
individual
has
a
right
legally
protect
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
be
free
from
having
his
tax
moneys
expended
for
in
the
furtherance
of
a
religious
purpose.
and
i
would
only
add
that
in
just
last
june,
this
court
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen,
as
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
specifically
indicated
referring
to
flast
against
cohen
that
something
more
than
adversary
interest
is
necessary
to
confer
standing.
there
must
be
an
addition,
some
connection
between
the
official
action
challenge
and
some
legally
protected
interest
party
challenging
that
action.
and
while
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
again
was
for
himself
and
two
other
justices
as
we
read
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions,
there
was
no
disagreement
on
this
interpretation
of
flast.
and
we
would
submit
if
the
court
pleases
that
in
this
case,
petitioners
have
not
established
requisite
connection
between
the
official
action
which
they
challenged
the
action
of
the
comptroller
interpreting
the
national
bank
act
and
some
legally
protected
interest
which
they
possess.
and
as
so
far
as
the
national
bank
act
is
concerned
as
they
admit
themselves
competitors
have
no
legally
protected
interest.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
over
a
period
of
almost
90
years
beginning
with
its
decision
in
1882
when
railroad
company
against
ellerman.
this
court
has
consistently
in
here
to
rule
that
where
as
is
concededly
the
case
here.
there
is
no
special
statutory
provision
for
judicial
review.
the
complainant
seeking
to
attack
governmental
action
which
does
no
more
than
increase
competition
against
him
or
show
that
he
possesses
a
legally
protective
right
to
be
free
from
that
competition,
now
the
court
has
further
made
it
clear
that
it
is
also
true
in
this
case.
no
such
legally
protected
right
is
conferred
by
license
or
franchise.
the
plaintiff
must
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
as
this
court
put
it
just
two
terms
ago
in
hardin
against
kentucky
utilities.
the
particular
statutory
provision
invoked
reflects
a
legislative
purpose
to
protect
the
competitive
interest.
if
but
only
if
such
a
purpose
appears
to
again
call
it
from
hardin,
the
injured
competitor
has
standing
to
require
compliance
with
that
provision.
now,
notwithstanding
the
present
reliance
petitioners
upon
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
few
minutes.
the
fact
remains
that
its
complaint
invoked
only
the
incidental
powers
clause
of
the
national
bank
act.
provision
of
12
u.s.c.
247
which
authorizes
national
banks
to
exercise
“such
incidental
powers
shall
be
necessary
to
carry
on
the
business
of
banking.”
specifically,
as
petitioner’s
complaint
reflects
their
attack
upon
the
comptroller’s
ruling
that
national
banks
may
provide
data
processing
services
to
other
banks
and
bank
customers
was
based
exclusively
on
the
proposition
that
such
services
do
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the
incidental
powers
clause.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
it
is
fatal
mr.
justice
harlan
from
this
point
of
view
for
the
reason
that
they
cannot
as
they
do
not
assert
that
the
conduct
which
they
are
seeking
to
enjoin
violates
any
statute
but
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
is
the
matter
your
honor
of
a
pleading
defect.
the
point
is
that
their
complaint
alleges
a
violation
of
the
national
bank
act
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
that
is
the
only
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
which
they
could
claim
have
been
violated,
it
wasn’t
that
any
inadvertent
failure
to
allege
a
violation
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
what
i'm
saying
your
honor
is
that
they
seek
to
base
their
claim
of
standing
upon
a
statute
which
they
cannot
claim
has
been
violated.
that’s
essentially
what
it
comes
down
to
and
not
only
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
our
position
is
that
they
lack
standing
irrespective
of
whether
the
national
bank
act
precludes
banks
from
engaging
in
the
activity
which
they
seek
to
enjoin.
our
position
rests
upon
this
proposition
that
even
if
it
could
be
said
on
the
merits
that
section
247
precludes
the
activity
of
which
they
complain,
the
fact
remains
that
section
247
was
not
enacted
to
protect
any
competitive
interest
of
these
petitioners
or
any
other
potential
competitors
of
national
banks.
and
that
for
this
reason
under
the
federal
standing
doctrine,
ellerman,
tennessee
power
v.
tva,
the
hardin
case
is
the
last
expression
of
the
court
that
they
lack
standing
that
they
would
only
have
standing
if
they
could
show
not
merely
that
the
statute
was
violated
but
then
it
was
intended
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
over
theirs.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
in
the
circumstances
--
present
circumstances,
the
action
on
the
part
of
a
bank
in
violation
of
the
act
could
be
challenged
by
bank’s
supervisory
authorities.
it
is
possible
that
with
respect
to
some
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act
which
might
have
been
designed
to
protect
possibly
the
solvency
of
banks
that
their
depositors
or
customers
might
have
a
standing
--
or
shareholders.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
so
if
the
shareholder
again
could
establish
as
i
think
he
would
very
like
to
be
able
to
in
many
instances
at
least
that
the
provision
which
was
being
violated
by
the
bank
was
intended
to
ensure
the
solvency
of
the
bank.
additionally,
if
your
honor
pleases,
any
time
that
the
congress
sees
fit
to
insert
in
this
statute
a
person
aggrieved
provision.
review
would
be
available
at
the
behest
of
people
who
would
qualify
as
persons
aggrieved.
the
congress
has
not
chosen
to
close
these
petitioners
with
the
status
of
essentially
private
attorneys
general.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
there
are
areas
--
many
areas
in
which
the
superintendence
of
compliance
with
statutory
mandates
rest
with
the
congress
itself.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
in
this
instance
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
think
your
honor
with
respect
to
this
particular
provision
there
are
few
individuals
would
have
standing
to
attack
the
provision.
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
stockholders
well
might
but
certainly
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
i
would
think
it’s
quite
possible
the
stockholders
would
but
in
the
realm
of
competitors,
the
realm
of
individuals
such
as
these
petitioners
who
are
complaining
of
competitive
activity
in
the
part
of
the
banks.
their
remedy
lies
with
the
congress
to
which
they
have
gone
repeatedly.
but
before
and
after,
the
passage
of
the
bank
service
corporation
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
precisely
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
--
again
the
adapso
itself
has
been
before
the
congress.
it
has
sought
after
the
bank
service
corporation
act
was
passed
to
have
congress
specifically
preclude
data
processing
service
activities
on
the
part
of
banks
except
as
they
related
to
the
internal
operations
of
the
bank.
they
have
also
called
the
congress’
attention,
the
absence
of
a
judicial
review
provision
and
the
necessity
for
such
a
provision.
and
to
this
point
those
pleas
have
fallen
on
deaf
ears.
now,
we
say
it
is
quite
appropriate
for
the
congress
to
decide
whereas
here
there
is
no
legally
protective
right
of
the
petitioners
being
invaded
appropriate
to
the
congress
to
decide,
the
extent
to
which
it
wishes
to
deputize
these
petitioners
or
any
other
class
as
private
attorney’s
general
to
enforce
what
they
say
is
the
public
interest
and
compliance
with
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor.
it’s
my
--
if
congress
had
done
this
for
the
protection
of
competitors
then
under
the
established
standing
doctrine,
the
latest
decision
being
your
honor’s
decision
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
hardin,
but
we
insist
if
the
court
pleases
that
the
restriction
which
they
seek
to
enforce
--
the
restriction
of
the
national
bank
act
was
not
intended
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
and
indeed
they
don’t
argue
to
the
contrary,
they
have
never
suggested
either
on
the
lower
courts
or
in
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
their
contention
is
that
in
the
bank
service
corporation
act
specifically
with
relation
to
section
4
of
that
act
that
congress
manifested
an
intent
to
protect
data
processors
from
the
kind
of
competition
of
which
their
complaining.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
that’s
not
my
argument
your
honor.
if
the
bank
service
corporation
act
in
this
legislative
history
manifested
a
congressional
intent
to
protect
data
processing
service
companies
from
competition
on
the
part
of
national
banks,
then
i
would
certainly
agree
that
under
the
teachings
of
this
court
is
recently
again
in
the
hardin
case
standing
what
exist.
what
we
say
is
that
the
--
there
isn’t
a
job
or
syllable
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
to
indicate
any
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
bank
service
corporations
from
the
competition
of
which
they
are
complaining
here.
now,
the
legislative
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
only
extent
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
bank
service
corporation
act
begin
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
suggest
that
we
did
not
need
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
controversy
because
the
merits
are
of
course
are
in
terms
of
an
alleged
violation
of
the
national
bank
act.
and
it’s
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question
whether
or
not
the
national
bank
act
has
been
violated
in
order
to
decide
standing.
now,
with
respect
to
the
bank
service
corporation
act,
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
to
examine
this
legislative
history
and
to
determine
whether
the
congress
was
intending
by
that
act
to
any
extent
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
of
data
processing
service
companies
against
national
bank
competition.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
this
was
an
attack
upon
a
bank
service
corporation
activity,
i
think
the
standing
question
would
be
much
closer.
i
say
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor
for
this
reason.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
because
the
only
statement
in
the
entire
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
which
manifested
any
concern
for
the
protection
of
data
processors
was
the
statement
on
the
floor
by
senator
proxmire.
now,
this
court
has
questioned
before
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
provision
itself
could
have
been
for
many
different
reasons.
in
the
congressional
mind,
the
provision
itself
might
have
been
a
gain
because
of
the
feeling
that
bank
service
corporations
in
the
general
public
interest
without
relation
to
any
specific
competitive
rule
should
not
be
engaging
in
activities
other
than
the
providing
of
bank
services
to
banks.
there’s
no
way
of
really
telling
what
of
many
possible
approaches
there
might
have
been,
but
this
much
is
clear.
we’re
dealing
with
national
banks
here,
congress
in
connection
with
the
bank
service
corporation
act
both
banking
and
currency
committees,
both
the
committee
in
the
house
and
the
committee
in
the
senate
were
specifically
apprised
of
the
fact
that
national
banks
were
engaged
in
this
activity.
now,
if
there
was
some
concern
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
what
is
the
bank
service
corporation
itself?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there’s
no
bank
service
corporation
involved
in
the
present
case
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
bank
services
--
well,
what
they
seek
to
enjoin
as
being
outside
of
the
scope
of
247
is
the
providing
of
data
processing
services
to
customers
of
the
bank.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
with
what
kind
of
services?
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
they
would
include
for
example
putting
a
company’s
payroll
through
a
computer.
it’s
the
kind
of
record
in
the
bookkeeping
type
of
services
which
today
are
provided
in
most
up-to-date
business
establishments
signed
an
automated
basis.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that’s
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
the
--
getting
back
if
i
may
just
for
minute
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
had
there
been
this
concern
that
petitioners
insist
existing
regarding
competition
on
the
part
of
banks
themselves
--
the
national
banks
in
particular
with
data
processing
service
companies,
that
section
4
would
not
have
been
cast
as
it
is
solely
in
terms
of
bank
service
corporations
but
what
have
embraced
banks
as
well.
an
important
fact,
section
5
of
the
act
does
deal
with
banks
in
a
completely
of
course
unrelated
context.
now,
we
see
and
think
it
is
very
difficult
for
petitioners
to
seriously
argue
here.
even
though
the
statute
which
they
claim
is
being
violated,
the
only
statute
national
bank
act
was
not
intended
for
their
protection
and
i
admit
this,
implicitly
at
least,
that
they
have
standing
to
complain
violations
of
the
national
bank
act
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
which
is
on
its
face
does
not
apply
to
bank
service
corporations.
circumstances
where
the
congress
that
both
congressional
committees
were
informed
the
banks
were
engaging
in
this
activity
and
not
only
does
the
act
not
refer
to
banks
in
this
context,
but
there
wasn’t
one
single
suggestion
and
the
committee
reports
of
either
committee
that
this
was
an
activity
which
should
be
legislated
the
case.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
motivation
for
the
act?
it
was
considered
in
1962
both
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
the
federal
reserve
board
that
a
bank
was
precluded,
absolutely
precluded
from
owning
stock
in
another
corporation.
the
purpose
of
the
bank
service
corporation
act
was
to
enable
banks
to
invest
to
these
bank
service
corporations
so
that
banks
particularly
small
ones
could
combine
to
obtain
the
advantage
of
among
other
things
automated
facilities
which
individually
they
could
not
have
purchased.
the
whole
basis
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
the
motivation
of
the
act
indeed
was
to
provide
assistance
to
banks
not
to
impose
any
kind
of
restrictions
that
were
not
already
there.
and
i
think
that
representative
malter
who
is
a
senior
member
of
the
banking
of
currency
committee
really
admonished
against
the
kind
of
approach
which
the
petitioners
advance
here
and
the
quotation
which
appears
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
american
bank
association
on
page
12.
i
won’t
read
the
quote,
but
he
specifically
indicates
that
he
wants
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
this
bill
was
not
intended
to
go
outside
the
very
language
appearing
in
the
bill
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
it
will
not
interfere
with
any
authority
now
invested
in
banks
and
that
it
simply
sets
up
a
new
means
by
which
individual
banks
can
acquire
these
additional
services.
now,
it
was
in
part
in
parcel
of
the
conferral
of
this
benefit
upon
banks
if
this
restriction
was
put
in
which
was
--
limits
the
bank
service
corporation
to
performing
bank
services
for
banks.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
may
have
been
that
it
was
initially
spearheaded
by
that
rule,
but
i
think
your
honor
pleases
that
the
actual
motivation
of
the
congressional
adoption
of
this
provision
was
to
just
get
that
bank
service
corporation
act
through,
it’s
a
form
of
compromise
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
indication
of
beyond
the
senator
proxmire
of
an
interest
in
data
processing
service
companies.
but
even
so
the
interest
was
reflected
only
in
the
context
of
the
activities
of
the
bank
service
corporation
itself.
now,
i
wish
to
stress
again
that
as
said
out
in
some
length
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bank
association
there
have
been
several
bills
for
the
congress
since
1962
in
which
they
--
there
has
been
in
connection
with
which
there
has
been
a
request
usually
spearheaded
by
adapso
that
there
be
a
prohibition
directly
impose
on
banks
with
respect
to
data
processing
service
activities.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
committee
reports,
i
don’t
recall
mr.
chief
justice
whether
there
is
a
specific
statement
in
the
committee
reports
to
that
effect.
but
the
whole
thrust
of
the
reports
of
the
two
houses,
the
majority
views
particularly
i
wish
to
stress
that
the
petitioner
is
here
from
the
statement
which
i
quote
from
the
supplemental
minority
views
that
they
according
from
a
minority
view
and
even
there
it
doesn’t
go
in
really
to
the
matter
of
protection
competitors
but
simply
solvency.
but
the
whole
thrust
really
the
majority
views
of
the
two
committees
is
that
this
is
an
act
which
is
designed
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
bank
service
corporations
and
not
in
any
other
area.
and
we
think
that
it
is
really
is
not
appropriate
basis
for
carrying
over
this
statute
into
another
area
and
allowing
it
to
be
used
as
a
statutory
aid
standing
to
question
activity
under
a
statute
which
was
not
intended
to
protect
the
competitor
who
has
bring
the
challenge.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
i
suggested
that
possibility.
well,
i
meant
to
say
was
that
that
would
be
a
much
closer
case.
there,
if
they
well
might
be
found
to
have
standing.
and
on
the
other
hand,
there’s
an
argument
at
least
that
they
would
lack
standing.
it
was
not
a
gain
i
wish
to
stress
it’s
a
completely
different
situation
than
the
one
which
is
before
the
court
here
where
they
are
not
invoking
as
the
basis
of
complaint
of
the
legality
of
that
act,
some
other
statute.
now,
i
would
only
add
have
if
the
court
pleases
that
for
the
reasons
that
are
detailed
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
reason
why
this
court
should
suggest
--
excuse
me,
should
adopt
the
alternative
suggestion
of
petitioners
that
the
rule
of
ellerman,
tennessee
power,
and
hardin
be
discarded.
we
think
that
that
rule
does
not
as
petitioners
suggest
--
would
suggest
we
think
the
rule
does
not
leave
the
public
interest
unprotected.
we
think
what
it
does
do
is
leave
it
to
the
congress
inappropriately
so
to
determine
where
superintendence
of
the
administrative
action
should
be
when
those
circumstances
where
the
claimant
can
point
to
the
invasion
of
no
legally
protected
right.
we
think
that
fundamentally
what
the
role
of
the
court
is
--
the
proper
role
of
the
court
is
the
--
that
of
a
guardian
of
legally
protected
rights
and
interests.
we
think
that
outside
of
that
realm,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
congress
to
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
it
wishes
the
courts
to
extend
judicial
review
to
those
who’s
like
these
petitioners
it
can
claim
solely
aggrieved
in
the
fact.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
flast
and
cohen
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
believe
to
be
fully
consistent
with
the
standing
cases
upon
which
we
rely.
in
flast
and
cohen
--
against
cohen,
this
court
held
that
in
so
far
as
the
article
3
requirement
of
the
case
of
controversy
is
concerned
that
it
was
enough
that
there
be
a
substantial
personal
state.
but
the
court
there
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
there
was
obviously
a
legal
right
involved
as
the
court
construed
the
first
amendment.
they
--
that
individual
has
a
right
legally
protect
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
be
free
from
having
his
tax
moneys
expended
for
in
the
furtherance
of
a
religious
purpose.
and
i
would
only
add
that
in
just
last
june,
this
court
in
jenkins
versus
mckeithen,
as
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
marshall
specifically
indicated
referring
to
flast
against
cohen
that
something
more
than
adversary
interest
is
necessary
to
confer
standing.
there
must
be
an
addition,
some
connection
between
the
official
action
challenge
and
some
legally
protected
interest
party
challenging
that
action.
and
while
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
again
was
for
himself
and
two
other
justices
as
we
read
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions,
there
was
no
disagreement
on
this
interpretation
of
flast.
and
we
would
submit
if
the
court
pleases
that
in
this
case,
petitioners
have
not
established
requisite
connection
between
the
official
action
which
they
challenged
the
action
of
the
comptroller
interpreting
the
national
bank
act
and
some
legally
protected
interest
which
they
possess.
and
as
so
far
as
the
national
bank
act
is
concerned
as
they
admit
themselves
competitors
have
no
legally
protected
interest.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
