justice
potter
stewart
well,
suppose
there
are
some
trial
cases
of
the
court
that
would
have
been
decided
differently
under
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
they
--
we
must
--
for
you
to
win,
must
we
buy
the
bank
service
corporation
approach?
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
saying
that
it
isn’t
enough
for
standing
just
to
show
an
economic
injury?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
urging
that
we
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
accepting
those
cases,
you
still
think
you
have
pending
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
when
the
statutory
aid
is
under
the
bank
service
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
only
source?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
don’t
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
was
the
motivation
to
that
section
4
to
narrow
my
brother
harlan’s
question
a
little
bit?
i
have
in
mind
the
--
what
judge
bailey
aldrich
says
about
its
motivation.
i
haven’t
independently
looked
at
the
legislative
history
but
he
says
it’s
very
clear
to
him
that
that
motivation
came
from
the
national
society
of
public
accountants
who
were
afraid
of
the
competition
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
compromising
was
what
interest
on
the
other
side?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosenthal,
as
i
understood
you
in
an
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
said
that
if
the
facts
of
this
case
were
that
a
bank
service
corporation
was
performing
these
services
for
a
hardware
store
directly
that
these
petitioners
would
still
not
have
standing?
