unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
a,
i
thought
it
was
waiting
for
you,
you
told
them
that
you’d
be
in
touch
with
them
or
something.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it?
you
said
they
have
agreed,
that
they
are
valid
and
they
haven’t
been
paid,
why
is
it?
what
ground
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ordman,
may
i
ask?
unknown
speaker
the
back
pay
which
is
after
the
court
order
say,
may
there
be
determined
back
pay
whether
or
not
a
particular
employee
is
entitled?
unknown
speaker
only
whether
he
is
entitled
back
pay
of
which
or
another
consideration?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
get
an
order,
reinstate
all
strikers
with
pay?
unknown
speaker
how
about
reinstatement
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
reinstate?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
all
strikers
except
those
the
board
had
laid
off?
unknown
speaker
according
to
misconduct?
unknown
speaker
what
about
those
that
take
other
jobs?
unknown
speaker
haven’t
they
ordered
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
way
said
that
to
reinstate
all
strikers
but
then
the
company
says
i’m
not
going
to
reinstate
these
200
because
i
got
thousand
defenses
and
lost
my
defenses
in
the
board
--
unknown
speaker
--
whenever
i
give
a
chance?
unknown
speaker
what
was
ordered
(inaudible),
is
that
the
original
order?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back.
the
original
order
of
the
court
was
reinstate
all
strikers.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
one
you
are
speaking
of?
unknown
speaker
what
have
you
say
that’s
open
and
shut
because
there’s
still
to
be
litigated
as
individual
strikers
whether
the
individual
strikers
will
listen
to
positive
statement
not
that
open
and
shut?
unknown
speaker
wasn’t
that
what
this
case
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
which
ones
they
are
to
have
litigated?
the
company
says
there
are
hundred
and
it
turns
out
there
were
only
10.
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
saying
is
that
employer
then
who
runs
this,
if
he
refuses
to
reinstate
on
the
grounds
that
he’s
got
a
valid
defense,
he
has
to
run
the
risks
on
the
back,
of
having
to
pay
back,
back
pay
if
he’s
wrong?
unknown
speaker
and
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
how
long
he
has
to
wait
for
a
hearing.
he
says
i’ve
got
a
valid
defense,
i
want
an
early
hearing
on
this
and
the
board
waits
three
or
four
years,
that’s
just
the
employer’s
hard
luck?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
he
get
a
hearing
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
sue
the
board
for
early
hearing,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
gotten
around
to
it
any
sooner
if
it
had
sued
you?
unknown
speaker
would
mind
speaking
a
little
louder,
i
can’t
quite
hear
you.
unknown
speaker
you
say
indefinite
order,
where
is
the
order?
which
part
of
it?
you
say
it’s
indefinite.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
they
ordered
all
of
them
be
reinstated?
unknown
speaker
now
mr.
read,
basically
i
can’t
find
anywhere
in
the
record,
is
it
here?
the
only
decree
the
court
which
i
can
find
is
the
1968
decree?
could
that
be
here?
unknown
speaker
the
1957
decree;
that
does
not
seem
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
on
page
959,
the
relevant
part
of
this
quote
in
the
court
below
opinion,
page
959
of
volume
2
--
volume
2
of
the
record.
is
it
the
opinion
or
the
decree?
the
decree.
this
is
the
decree?
oh!
then
you
cite
the
decree
of
august
1957?
that’s
right.
it’s
just
an
excerpt
from?
it’s
an
excerpt
from.
but
the
decree
itself,
the
complete
decree,
nowhere
it
appears?
not
in
print.
no
it
does
not.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
with
the
question?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
reluctance?
unknown
speaker
how
much
do
you
owe
to
the
person
that
has
been
on
dismissible?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
--
let’s
assume
a
company,
after
a
general
order
like
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
feels
that
it
has
some
good
faith
defenses
in
connection
with
any
number
of
these
strikers
and
it
says
i
want
to
litigate
this
for
the
board,
it
can
do
that
i
take
it.
those
matters
were
reserve
under
these
orders?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can
litigate
it.
i
would
suppose
you
would
agree
that
that
if
you
lose
in
connection
with
employee
“a”
say
and
your
defense
is
rejected
and
you
are
then
ordered
to
reinstate
them,
i
would
suppose
you
would
agree
you
have
to
give
them
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
if
so,
this
case
really
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
you
can
be
ordered
to
give
back
pay
if
the
proceeding
where
you
litigate
the
validity
of
your
defenses
happens
to
occur
four
years
instead
of
two
years
or
one
year
after
the
general
order
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
object
right
now
to,
i
gather
to
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
that
says
you
have
to
pay
them
for
two
years?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
just
the
other
two-year
back
pay
order.
unknown
speaker
and
so
it’s
a
question
of
where
the
incidence
of
delay
must
fall
on
the
employees
or
on
the
company?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any,
are
there
any
approximation
on
what
to,
what
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
contended
before
the
court
i
gather
from
its
opinion
but
you
don’t
want
to
admit
it
then?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
actual
difference
between
it
now?
unknown
speaker
financial?
unknown
speaker
yes,
in
money?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
interest.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
about
95?
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
all
the
difference
you
say?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
a,
i
thought
it
was
waiting
for
you,
you
told
them
that
you’d
be
in
touch
with
them
or
something.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it?
you
said
they
have
agreed,
that
they
are
valid
and
they
haven’t
been
paid,
why
is
it?
what
ground
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ordman,
may
i
ask?
unknown
speaker
the
back
pay
which
is
after
the
court
order
say,
may
there
be
determined

pay
whether
or
not
a

or
another
consideration?
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
get
an
order,
reinstate
all
strikers
with
pay?
unknown
speaker
how
about
reinstatement
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
to

unknown
speaker
you
mean
