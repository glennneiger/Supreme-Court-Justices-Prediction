mr.
henry
j.
read
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
our
position
basically
in
this
matter
that
the
further
affirmative
action
was
required
by
the
board.
the
fifth
circuit
--–
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
fifth
circuit
in
enforcing
the
board
order
specifically
said
that
that
the
numerous
problems
which
the
employer
had
in
deciding
who
to
reinstate
and
under
what
circumstances,
the
full
text
of
the
language
is
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
numerous
problems
were
not
foreclosed
by
the
board
order
or
by
the
enforcing
opinion
but
were
reserved
for
further
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board.
promptly,
upon
the
issuance
of
the
board
of
the
enforcing
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
employer
submitted
a
report
to
the
board
in
which
it
gave
payroll
information,
the
job
classifications,
operations
numbers,
strike
list,
the
names
of
those
persons
who
had
applied
for
reinstatement
and
the
date
upon
which
they
had
been
reinstated.
the
company
said
if
any
incidence
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
this
order
that
comes
to
your
attention,
we’d
like
to
know
about
it
because
we
intend
to
comply
and
we
want
to
comply.
now,
the
board
didn’t
reply
to
that
letter
and
i
submit
that
on
the
face
of
this
record,
the
board
should
not
say
to
the
court
that
we
should
have
done
anything
further
because
the
board
is
on
record
in
this
proceeding
as
we
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief,
as
being
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
no
duty
to
advise
us
at
all
about
our
obligations
under
this
indefinite
order
and
that
it
was
up
to
us
to
comply
literally
or
to
use
the
terms
that
they
used
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
haec
verba.
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
order
is
indefinite
in
that
it
does
not
name
the
names
of
the
persons
to
be
reinstated
and
in
my
submission
to
the
court
requires
further
implementation
in
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board
before
there
can
be
a
final
judgment
as
to
what
individual
is
entitled
to
be
reinstated
and
when.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
there
were
–
no,
because
the
enforcing
language
of
the
court
specifically
reserved
such
questions
as
the
availability
of
jobs,
misconduct,
the
availability
of
the
strikers
and
any
number
of
specific
problems
which
were
referred
to
by
the
employer
and
which
were
specifically
reserved
by
the
court
for
future
determination
in
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board
which
proceedings
were
not
held
until
this
opinion
was
in
1951,
in
june
of
1957.
they
didn’t
file
a
back
pay
specification
until
i
think
it
was
november
of
1961,
four
years
and
four
months
later.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that
was
a
very,
very
serious
issue
mr.
justice
marshall
for
this
reason.
now,
whether
we
were
right
or
wrong,
it
was
our
contention
and
we
presented
the
evidence
of
an
industrial
engineer
to
support
our
position.
with
our
contention
that
we
may
--
that
we
maintain
a
balance
line
operation
in
the
plant
and
that
the
production
qualifications
of
each
operator
in
each
step
of
the
production
line
had
to
be
in
balance.
all
the
--
all
of
the
employees
would
suffer
if
you
have
one
operator
who
is
capable
of
only
50
dozen
per
stated
time
period,
whereas
the
line
is
engineered
for
a
hundred.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
but
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
we
had
a
legal
issue
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
obligated
to
prejudice
the
earnings
of
14
operators
in
a
15-operator
line
by
the
fact
that
we
had
an
application
from
someone
whose
capabilities
did
not
measure
up
to
the
engineering
of
the
line.
now,
whether
we
were
right
on
that
or
not,
i
say
is
pre-
admitted
at
this
time
because
the
fact
is
the
court
said
specifically
that
the
availability
of
work
at
various
times
considering
the
nature
of
this
engineer
--
of
this
manufacturing
operations,
this
raised
questions
which
had
to
be
resolved
in
further
and
future
administrative
proceeding
before
the
board.
mr.
henry
j.
read
oh!
by
no
means
sir,
we
were
reinstate
--
we
were
not
adamant
in
refusing
to
comply
with
this
order,
i
hasten
to
dispel
that
suggestion.
we
complied
with
this
order.
even
the
board
in
its
post
hoc,
critical
second
guessing
of
what
we
did
concedes
that
we
complied
with
70%
of
the
cases
that
they
say
that
were
involved.
we
did
not
stand
fast
and
refuse
to
comply.
we
did
comply
and
we
took
people
on
as
we
could
work
them
into
these
operations.
we
had
other
problems,
for
instance,
there
was
this
problem
and
again
i’m
not
arguing
today
that
i
am
right,
i’m
simply
arguing
that
this
was
a
problem
on
this
point
that
the
union
submitted
letters
in
which
they
listed
the
names
of
the
strikers
who
wish
to
return.
we
responded
and
said
in
an
orderly
rebuilding
process,
we
would
ask
that
you
send
people
in
at
20
a
day
so
we
can
work
them
in.
they
wrote
back
and
said
we’ll
do
that.
now,
they
say
and
i
must
say
that’s
too
late
to
argue
about
the
correctness
of
it,
they
say
that
this
did
not
invalidate
the
original
application
of
which
they
say
was
effective
even
though
they
agree
to
send
people
in
but
it
has
left
us
because
we
thought
that
the
people
who
were
interested
in
their
jobs
would
come
into
the
plant
as
the
union
had
said
they
would
in
its
letter.
and
in
many
instances,
the
problems
which
the
company
has
today
resulted
from
the
fact
that
persons
who
did
not
show
their
availability
were
ultimately
held
by
the
board
to
have
been
entitled
to
reinstatement
by
virtue
of
the
union
letter
of
application.
i
referred
to
that
not
to
reargue
that
point
but
simply
to
demonstrate
another
area
in
which
there
was
doubt,
another
area
in
which
this
author
was
indefinite,
and
another
area
in
which
he’d
require
administrative
definition
by
the
board
which
was
not
forthcoming.
now
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
board
order
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
board
order
as
my
memory
serves
me,
that
to
reinstate
as
immediately
upon
application,
reinstate
all
strikers
and
to
pay
them
back
pay
within
five
days
of
application.
mr.
henry
j.
read
right
then,
we
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
the
order
that’s
before
us.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
but
it
was
enforced
mr.
justice
black
in
the
language
to
which
i
earlier
referred
in
which
the
enforcing
court
specifically
reserved
for
future
determination
the
defenses
of
the
employer.
mr.
henry
j.
read
we’re
looking
for
the
1957
decree
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
henry
j.
read
it’s
not
in
the
record.
mr.
henry
j.
read
when
the
board
ultimately
in
1961,
the
fall
of
1961,
filed
a
back
pay
specification
we
filed
an
answer
in
which
we
asserted
numerous
defenses.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
we
asserted
a
misconduct
defense.
that
was
one.
we
asserted
a
--
mr.
henry
j.
read

mr.
henry
j.
read
delay.
well
now,
mr.
justice
black,
these
employees
have
not
been
deprived
of
that
pay.
we
are
under
an
order
which
is
not
under
review
to
pay
back
pay
which
is
going
to
amount
to
well
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
mr.
henry
j.
read
in
this
case?
mr.
henry
j.
read
we
say
that
the
court
below
properly
modified
the
board
back
pay
order
because
of
the
inordinate
delay
of
the
board.
that’s
the
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
they’d
modified
it
by
inserting
a
cutoff
date
--
mr.
henry
j.

no,

well
sir,
that’s
a
matter
of
argument

mr.

read
well
sir,
we
argued
to
the
court
and
the
court,
if
i
may
put
it
this
way,
seem
to
see
--
mr.
henry

read
correctness
of
the
argument
that
under
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
nlrb
versus
brown,
which
is
the
decision
that
they
referred
to
that
it
is
the
proper
function
of
the
reviewing
court
to
look
at
the
remedial
order
of
the
board
and
consider
its
fairness
and
balance
the
conflicting
interest
and
it
evidently
felt
and
said
that
this
employer
having
submitted
the
information
that
it
did
about
its
compliance
program
and
the
board
not

having
taken
no
action
to

a
specification
for
four
years

furthermore,
have
offered

no
cooperation

made
no
attempt

work
out
an
amicable
settlement
to
this
case
prior

mr.
henry

read
they
said
that
the
back

order
of

modified.
the
fifth
circuit
said
the
back
pay
order
of
the
court
would
be
modified
by
inserting
a
cutoff
date
in
1959.
mr.
henry
j.
read
i
think
its
june
of
1959.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
about
five
years
of
back
pay.
it
was

mr.
henry
j.
read
yes
sir,
but
that
is
much
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
that
is
correct,
yes.
but
on
that
point,
this
is
in
a
side
which
i
feel
i
must
insert
here,
mr.
ordman
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
are
employees
who
have
not
been
paid
their
back
pay
as
of
this
date.
the
reason
for
that
is,
the
litigation
isn’t
over
and
the
fifth
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
fix
back
pay
and
we
don’t
know
how
much
to
pay.
mr.
henry
j.
read
we
haven’t
paid
any
because
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
no,
because
they
never
have
told
us
how
much
to
pay
and
secondly,
secondly,
mr.
ordman
makes
statement
which
i
must
take
issue
with
when
he
says
that
there
are
people
who
have
not
been
reinstated,
this
same
mistake
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
union
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
post
argument,
correspondents
which
are
trustees
in
the
record,
we
showed
that
everyone
with
the
exception
of
three
persons
had
been
offered
reinstatement
or
have
been
disqualified.
mr.
henry

not

back
pay
proceeding?
mr.
henry
j.
read
other
than
in
the
back
pay
proceeding.
there
is
an
order
of
the
board
which
is
not
final
in
my
judgment
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
refused
to
enforce
it
and
has
remanded
it
to
the
board
for
final
fixing
of
the
amounts
due
under
that
portion
of
the
order
which
was
enforced.
mr.

no

if
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
henry

read
if
i
understand
the
courts
--
your
question,
the
answer
is
in
the
negative.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
of
course,
if
that
is
the
intent
of
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
i’ll
answer
it
in
the
affirmative
but
i
--
mr.
henry

read
i
was
having
trouble
understanding
the
question
as
a
claim,
as
intending
to
refer
to
a
claim
submitted
to
the
company
personally.
there
have
been
no
claims
asserted
other
than
those
asserted
by
the
board
in
the
back

proceeding.
mr.

read
correct,
correct,
yes.
mr.

mr.

read
we,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
have
absolutely
no
objection,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
i
considered
tendering
the
amount
which
i
thought
was
due
but
i
decided
against
it
and
my
client
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
and
is
willing
to
do
it
today
of
course
but
i
decided
it
was
premature
until
such
time
as
the
board
tells
us
how
much
that
is.
there’s
absolutely
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
this
company
to
pay
the
back
pay
that
is
not
under
review
--
mr.

read
no,
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
there’s
absolutely
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
company
and
i
say
that
without
any
qualification
at
all.
there’s
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
this
company
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
no
sir,
that’s
my
point.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
correct.
that’s
my
appreciation
of
the
status
of
the
case.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
read
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
henry
j.
read
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
oh!
no
sir,
that’s
not
an
issue
here
at
all
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
henry
j.
read
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
the
case,
that’s
the
case
and
i’m
not
sure.
now,
this
delay
issue
first
was
injected
into
the
case
when
we
tried
to
enjoin
the
back
pay
hearing
at
the
time
that
it
was
filed
in
1961
and
the
board
went
into
the
fifth
circuit
at
that
time
and
it
didn’t
deny
that
the
delay
occurred,
it
admitted
that
the
delay
occurred
and
as
the
court
said,
it
admitted
that
inordinate
or
unreasonable
delay
occurred.
but
it
said
to
the
court,
don’t
enjoin
us
from
holding
a
back
pay
hearing
because
we
can
take
delay
into
consideration
and
we
can
protect
the
company’s
interest
and
inferring
no
matter
what
we
do,
our
decision
with
regard
to
delay
will
ultimately
be
reviewed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
well
then
when
the
case
is
remand,
when
the
case
proceeds
under
the
back
pays
classification,
the
board
doesn’t
make
any
reduction
on
the
grounds
of
delay.
in
fact,
the
board’s
decision
doesn’t
say
a
word
about
delay
and
the
trial
examiner
said
that
he
didn’t
consider
and
give
you
that
exact
language
because
i
do
believe
it’s
important.
referring
to
delay,
the
examiner
having
ultimately
ruled
that
none
of
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
i’m
reading
from
page
55
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
examiner
having
ultimately
ruled
that
none
of
this
issues
were
properly
before
him
for
our
disposition
in
accordance
with
this
ruling
having
refused
absence
--
absence
to
proffer
of
evidence
of
wrongful
or
unlawful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
general
counsel
which
was
not
forthcoming
to
permit
the
parties
fully
to
develop
the
facts
regarding
delay
i
interpret.
and
when
the
fifth
circuit
then,
when
the
company
complains
about
the
fact
that
the
board
didn’t
take
delay
into
consideration.
the
board
comes
into
the
fifth
circuit
and
takes
diametrically
opposed
positions.
it
says
that
time
in
this
proceeding
that
we
are
reviewing
here
now,
it
says
no
unreasonable
delay
occurred.
if
it
did,
it’s
up
to
us
and
our
discretion
to
assess
it.
it’s
up
to
us
to
decide
what
if
anything
to
do
about
it
and
the
limited
judicial
appellate
procedure
available
to
you
doesn’t
accord
the
fifth
circuit
the
right
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
it
says
furthermore,
even
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
the
right
to
review
our
decisions
in
the
delayed
area,
it
cannot
do
it
because
if
it
does,
its
applying
the
doctrine
of
laches
to
defeat
a
public
right.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
position
on
the
part
of
the
board
is
wrong
and
a
number
of
very
serious
ways.
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
the
statutory
scheme
whether
we’d
be
talking
about
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
whether
we’re
talking
about
the
administrative
procedure
act
contemplates
according
by
the
administrative
agency
the
right
to
judge
itself
fully,
finally
without
review.
it
may
have
the
right,
in
certain
areas
of
expertise,
in
which
it’s
assumed
that
they
have
expert
knowledge
to
judge
the
actions
of
litigants
before
it
but
it
has
no
expertise
when
it
comes
to
judging
its
own
derelictions.
i
say
the
board
is
wrong
about
that.
and
secondly,
on
the
question
of
laches,
it’s
a
principle
case
relied
upon
by
the
board
is
electric
vacuum
cleaner
decision
to
this
court
and
although
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
decision
here
and
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
circuit
court
decision
the
electric
vacuum
cleaner,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
proceedings
before
the
board
which
i
found,
they’re
not
in
my
brief
but
i
found
them
in
volume
101
of
the
transcripts
of
records
and
copies
of
brief
for
the
october
term
1941,
i
think
its
docket
number
588.
i
found
the
board
proceeding
in
that
case
and
the
board
has
done
in
that
case
precisely
what
it
says,
the
fifth
circuit
can’t
do
in
this
and
this
is
how
that
case
came
about.
in
the
electric
vacuum
cleaner
case,
the
board
issued
a
complaint
and
then
13
months
later
it
issued
a
finding
of
some
sort.
the
company
complained
about
the
fact
that
there
was
a
13
months
delay
and
it
also
complained
about
the
fact
that
the
board
hadn’t
issued
an
intermediate
report
which
procedurally
it
was
suppose
to
have
done.
the
company
filed
a
petition
for
review
under
section
10
(f)
of
the
labor
act
just
as
we
have
done
here
and
the
board
seeing
what
was
developing
withdrew
its
order
which
the
company
sought
to
review
and
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
petition
to
review
because
there
was
nothing
to
review.
sometime
later,
i
think
it
was,
well
i
don’t
remember
the
exact
date
but
it
was
sometime
later
on
that
the
board
then
issued
a
new
order
and
because
of
what
its
secretary
said
in
that
record
was
an
administrative
error
on
the
part
of
the
board
and
because
of
what
the
company
claimed
was
undue
delay,
the
board
excluded
from
the
back
pay
period
a
nine-month
period
and
exactly
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case.
now,
that
position
which
the
board
took
in
electric
vacuum
cleaner
in
the
board
proceeding
was
consistent
with
the
position
which
the
board
took
in
the
injunction
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
at
that
time,
there
was
no
talk
whatsoever
about
the
inability
of
the
board
to
take
its
own
delays
into
consideration
of
fashion
a
back
pay
order.
in
substance,
we
say
that
the
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
issue
orders
which
require
further
definition
than
waiting
inordinate
length
of
time
before
initiating
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
required
to
define
the
company’s
obligation
and
then
second
guess
the
company
on
what
it
did
--
what
it
did
in
its
reinstatement
program
in
the
meantime,
that’s
our
basic
complaint
in
this
case.
i
started
to
make
a
reference
to
something
i
consider
important
and
i
would
like
to
say
it
briefly
because
it’s
not
in
my
brief
and
that
is
i
want
to
make
a
reference
to
section
101.16
of
the
board’s
rules
which
provide
that
after
a
board
order
directing
payment
of
back
pay
has
been
issued
or
after
enforcement
of
such
order
by
a
court
decree,
if
in
formal
efforts
to
dispose
of
the
matter
proved
unsuccessful
the
regional
director
--
regional
director
is
then
authorize
at
his
discretion
to
issue
a
back
pay
specification.
i
consider
that
significant
because
they
didn’t,
they
made
no
effort
to
work
this
out
with
us
at
all,
they
simply
went
in
and
file
the
specification
seeking
$342,000
in
november
1961,
four
years
and
four
months
after
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
enforcing
the
decree
of
reinstatement
with
the
reservation
which
i
have
referred
to
and
the
compliance
officer
for
the
board
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
knew
that
our
letter
that
was
in
the
record
asking
to
be
advised
of
any
deviation
from
the
obligations
of
compliance,
we
were
on
the
record
as
wanting
to
comply
and
he
did
not
make
any
effort
to
discuss
with
us
and
an
informal
resolution
of
all
of
the
problems
which
were
--
which
have
to
be
resolved
before
there
could
be
a
clear
definition
of
what
the
board
order
require.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
sir.
originally,
the
specification
sought
$342,000.
in
the
hearing,
we
eliminated
45
people
in
the
back
pay.
in
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
and
before
the
court,
so
that’s
45
people
that
we
were
right
about.
the
board
order
reduced
the
amount
to
approximately
162,000.
the
order
of
the
fifth
circuit
reduced
it
to
about
90,000
or
95,000
but
there
is
interest
running
since
1964
so
that
i
make
a
rough
approximation
of
the
company’s
obligation
if
it
wins
this
case
is
still
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
$140,000.
that’s
if
we
win
this
case.
now,
if
we
lose
this
case,
what
the
board
intends
to
do
is
go
back
and
file
another
specification
and
try
to
exact
back
pay
from
1961
to
date
i
presume.
mr.
henry
j.
read
we
contended
that
for
this
reason
in
which
we
lost
on
this
point
but
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
i
still
think
i’m
right.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
this
was
the
point
justice
black,
the
board
order
said
to
reinstate
immediately
upon
application.
now,
i
took
the
position
that
this
meant,
that
this
was
prospective
in
nature,
but
we
couldn’t
reinstate
immediately
somebody
who
had
applied
a
year
before
the
board
order.
so
we
took
the
position
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
attempt
to
win
the
case
completely.
that
if,
that
we
were
only
responsible
to
reinstate
those
people
who
applied
prospectively
or
after
the
date
of
the
order,
but
we
lost
on
that
unfortunately,
but
that
is
the
basis
of
the
contention
that
i
made
at
that
junction
that
we
didn’t
know
the
minute
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
interpretation
of
the
order
which
i
think
has
some
relevance
here
as
well
because
its
another
indefinite
aspect
of
the
order.
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
difference
between?
mr.
henry
j.
read
financial?
mr.
henry
j.
read
leaving
out
the
interest?
mr.
henry
j.
read
leaving
out
interest,
it’s
a
difference
if
you
don’t
hold
me
to
accurately
figure
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
--
of
a
162
as
compared
to
about
95.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
all
the
difference,
that’s
all
the
difference.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
we
won
a
lot
of
the
cases
justice
white
on
the
very
issues
that
were
contemplated
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
enforcing
language.
for
instance,
we
won
some
misconduct
cases.
mr.
henry
j.
read
no,
no,
no,
the
specification
claim
342,
the
trial
examiner
ordered
about
a
162.
mr.
henry
j.
read
thus,
the
board
made
some
minor
adjustment
which
is
insignificant,
but
then
when
we
got
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
eliminated
a
few
more
of
the
cases
and
i
also
put
a
cutoff
date
which
cuts
it
down
to
about
95,000.
i
know
my
time
is
about
up,
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
word
about
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
my
time
is
up
i’m
sorry.
mr.
henry
j.
read
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
our
position
basically
in
this
matter
that
the
further
affirmative
action
was
required
by
the
board.
the
fifth
circuit
--–
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
fifth
circuit
in
enforcing
the
board
order
specifically
said
that
that
the
numerous
problems
which
the
employer
had
in
deciding
who
to
reinstate
and
under
what
circumstances,
the
full
text
of
the
language
is
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
numerous
problems
were
not
foreclosed
by
the
board
order
or
by
the
enforcing
opinion
but
were
reserved
for
further
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board.
promptly,
upon
the
issuance
of
the
board
of
the
enforcing
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
employer
submitted
a
report
to
the
board
in
which
it
gave
payroll
information,
the
job
classifications,
operations
numbers,
strike
list,
the
names
of
those
persons
who
had
applied
for
reinstatement
and
the
date
upon
which
they
had
been
reinstated.
the
company
said
if
any
incidence
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
this
order
that
comes
to
your
attention,
we’d
like
to
know
about
it
because
we
intend
to
comply
and
we
want
to
comply.
now,
the
board
didn’t
reply
to
that
letter
and
i
submit
that
on
the
face
of
this
record,
the
board
should
not
say
to
the
court
that
we
should
have
done
anything
further
because
the
board
is
on
record
in
this
proceeding
as
we
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief,
as
being
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
no
duty
to
advise
us
at
all
about
our
obligations
under
this
indefinite
order
and
that
it
was
up
to
us
to
comply
literally
or
to
use
the
terms
that
they
used
before
the
fifth
circuit
in
haec
verba.
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
order
is
indefinite
in
that
it
does
not
name
the
names
of
the
persons
to
be
reinstated
and
in
my
submission
to
the
court
requires
further
implementation
in
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board
before
there
can
be
a
final
judgment
as
to
what
individual
is
entitled
to
be
reinstated
and
when.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
there
were
–
no,
because
the
enforcing
language
of
the
court
specifically
reserved
such
questions
as
the
availability
of
jobs,
misconduct,
the
availability
of
the
strikers
and
any
number
of
specific
problems
which
were
referred
to
by
the
employer
and
which
were
specifically
reserved
by
the
court
for
future
determination
in
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board
which
proceedings
were
not
held
until
this
opinion
was
in
1951,
in
june
of
1957.
they
didn’t
file
a
back
pay
specification
until
i
think
it
was
november
of
1961,
four
years
and
four
months
later.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that
was
a
very,
very
serious
issue
mr.
justice
marshall
for
this
reason.
now,
whether
we
were
right
or
wrong,
it
was
our
contention
and
we
presented
the
evidence
of
an
industrial
engineer
to
support
our
position.
with
our
contention
that
we
may
--
that
we
maintain
a
balance
line
operation
in
the
plant
and
that
the
production
qualifications
of
each
operator
in
each
step
of
the
production
line
had
to
be
in
balance.
all
the
--
all
of
the
employees
would
suffer
if
you
have
one
operator
who
is
capable
of
only
50
dozen
per
stated
time
period,
whereas
the
line
is
engineered
for
a
hundred.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
but
the
point
that
i’m
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
we
had
a
legal
issue
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
obligated
to
prejudice
the
earnings
of
14
operators
in
a
15-operator
line
by
the
fact
that
we
had
an
application
from
someone
whose
capabilities
did
not
measure
up
to
the
engineering
of
the
line.
now,
whether
we
were
right
on
that
or
not,
i
say
is
pre-
admitted
at
this
time
because
the
fact
is
the
court
said
specifically
that
the
availability
of
work
at
various
times
considering
the
nature
of
this
engineer
--
of
this
manufacturing
operations,
this
raised
questions
which
had
to
be
resolved
in
further
and
future
administrative
proceeding
before
the
board.
mr.
henry
j.
read
oh!
by
no
means
sir,
we
were
reinstate
--
we
were
not
adamant
in
refusing
to
comply
with
this
order,
i
hasten
to
dispel
that
suggestion.
we
complied
with
this
order.
even
the
board
in
its
post
hoc,
critical
second
guessing
of
what
we
did
concedes
that
we
complied
with
70%
of
the
cases
that
they
say
that
were
involved.
we
did
not
stand
fast
and
refuse
to
comply.
we
did
comply
and
we
took
people
on
as
we
could
work
them
into
these
operations.
we
had
other
problems,
for
instance,
there
was
this
problem
and
again
i’m
not
arguing
today
that
i
am
right,
i’m
simply
arguing
that
this
was
a
problem
on
this
point
that
the
union
submitted
letters
in
which
they
listed
the
names
of
the
strikers
who
wish
to
return.
we
responded
and
said
in
an
orderly
rebuilding
process,
we
would
ask
that
you
send
people
in
at
20
a
day
so
we
can
work
them
in.
they
wrote
back
and
said
we’ll
do
that.
now,
they
say
and
i
must
say
that’s
too
late
to
argue
about
the
correctness
of
it,
they
say
that
this
did
not
invalidate
the
original
application
of
which
they
say
was
effective
even
though
they
agree
to
send
people
in
but
it
has
left
us
because
we
thought
that
the
people
who
were
interested
in
their
jobs
would
come
into
the
plant
as
the
union
had
said
they
would
in
its
letter.
and
in
many
instances,
the
problems
which
the
company
has
today
resulted
from
the
fact
that
persons
who
did
not
show
their
availability
were
ultimately
held
by
the
board
to
have
been
entitled
to
reinstatement
by
virtue
of
the
union
letter
of
application.
i
referred
to
that
not
to
reargue
that
point
but
simply
to
demonstrate
another
area
in
which
there
was
doubt,
another
area
in
which
this
author
was
indefinite,
and
another
area
in
which
he’d
require
administrative
definition
by
the
board
which
was
not
forthcoming.
now
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
board
order
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
board
order
as
my
memory
serves
me,
that
to
reinstate
as
immediately
upon
application,
reinstate
all
strikers
and
to
pay
them
back
pay
within
five
days
of
application.
mr.
henry
j.
read
right
then,
we
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
the
order
that’s
before
us.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
but
it
was
enforced

justice
black
in
the
language
to
which
i
earlier
referred
in
which
the
enforcing
court
specifically
reserved
for
future
determination
the
defenses
of
the
employer.
mr.
henry
j.
read
we’re
looking
for
the
1957
decree
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
henry
j.
read
it’s
not
in
the
record.
mr.
henry
j.
read
when
the
board
ultimately
in
1961,
the
fall
of
1961,
filed
a
back
pay
specification
we
filed
an
answer
in
which
we
asserted
numerous
defenses.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
we
asserted
a
misconduct
defense.
that
was
one.
we
asserted
a

mr.
henry

well
now,
mr.
justice
black,
these
employees
have
not
been
deprived
of
that
pay.
we
are
under
an
order
which
is
not
under
review
to
pay
back
pay
which
is
going
to
amount
to
well
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
mr.

in
this
case?
mr.
henry
j.
read
we
say
that

of
the
inordinate

that’s

of

function
of
the
reviewing
court
to
look
at
the
remedial
order
of
the
board

consider
its
fairness

fifth
circuit
said
the
back
pay
order
of

court

mr.

yes,
about
five
years
of
back
pay.

read
yes
sir,
but
that
is
much
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
that
is
correct,
yes.
but
on
that
point,
this
is
in
a
side
which
i
feel
i
must
insert
here,
mr.
ordman
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
are
employees
who
have
not
been
paid
their
back
pay
as
of
this
date.
the
reason
for
that
is,
the
litigation
isn’t
over
and
the
fifth
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
fix
back
pay
and
we
don’t
know
how
much
to
pay.
mr.
henry
j.
read

haven’t
paid
any
because
--
mr.
henry

no,
because
they
never
have
told
us
how
much
to

and
secondly,
secondly,
mr.
ordman
makes
statement
which
i
must
take
issue
with
when
he
says
that
there
are
people
who
have
not
been
reinstated,
this
same
mistake
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
union
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
post
argument,
correspondents
which
are
trustees

we

that
everyone
with

had
been

reinstatement

mr.

than

there
is
an
order
of
the
board
which
is
not
final
in
my
judgment
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
refused
to
enforce
it
and
has
remanded
it
to
the
board
for
final
fixing
of
the
amounts

was

in

mr.
henry

read
well,
of
course,
if
that
is
the
intent
of
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
i’ll
answer
it
in
the
affirmative
but
i

mr.

i
was
having
trouble
understanding
the
question
as
a

as
intending
to
refer
to

personally.
there
have
been

mr.
henry

read
well,
i
considered
tendering
the
amount
which
i
thought
was

i
decided
against
it
and
my
client
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
and
is
willing
to
do
it
today
of
course
but
i
decided
it
was
premature
until
such
time
as
the
board
tells
us
how
much
that
is.
there’s
absolutely
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
this
company
to
pay
the
back
pay
that
is
not
under
review

mr.

read
no,
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
there’s
absolutely
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
company
and
i
say
that
without
any
qualification
at
all.
there’s
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
this
company
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
no
sir,
that’s
my
point.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
correct.
that’s
my
appreciation
of
the
status
of
the
case.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
read
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
henry
j.
read
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
oh!
no
sir,
that’s
not
an
issue
here
at
all
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
henry
j.
read
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
the
case,
that’s
the
case
and
i’m
not
sure.
now,
this
delay
issue
first
was
injected
into
the
case
when
we
tried
to
enjoin
the
back
pay
hearing
at
the
time
that
it
was
filed
in
1961
and
the
board
went
into
the
fifth
circuit
at
that
time
and
it
didn’t
deny
that
the
delay
occurred,
it
admitted
that
the
delay
occurred
and
as
the
court
said,
it
admitted
that
inordinate
or
unreasonable
delay
occurred.
but
it
said
to
the
court,
don’t
enjoin
us
from
holding
a
back
pay
hearing
because
we
can
take
delay
into
consideration
and
we
can
protect
the
company’s
interest
and
inferring
no
matter
what
we
do,
our
decision
with
regard
to
delay
will
ultimately
be
reviewed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
well
then
when
the
case
is
remand,
when
the
case
proceeds
under
the
back
pays
classification,
the
board
doesn’t
make
any
reduction
on
the
grounds
of
delay.
in
fact,
the
board’s
decision
doesn’t
say
a
word
about
delay
and
the
trial
examiner
said
that
he
didn’t
consider
and
give
you
that
exact
language
because
i
do
believe
it’s
important.
referring
to
delay,
the
examiner
having
ultimately
ruled
that
none
of
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
i’m
reading
from
page
55
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
examiner
having
ultimately
ruled
that
none
of
this
issues
were
properly
before
him
for
our
disposition
in
accordance
with
this
ruling
having
refused
absence
--
absence
to
proffer
of
evidence
of
wrongful
or
unlawful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
general
counsel
which
was
not
forthcoming
to
permit
the
parties
fully
to
develop
the
facts
regarding
delay
i
interpret.
and
when
the
fifth
circuit
then,
when
the
company
complains
about
the
fact
that
the
board
didn’t
take
delay
into
consideration.
the
board
comes
into
the
fifth
circuit
and
takes
diametrically
opposed
positions.
it
says
that
time
in
this
proceeding
that
we
are
reviewing
here
now,
it
says
no
unreasonable
delay
occurred.
if
it
did,
it’s
up
to
us
and
our
discretion
to
assess
it.
it’s
up
to
us
to
decide
what
if
anything
to
do
about
it
and
the
limited
judicial
appellate
procedure
available
to
you
doesn’t
accord
the
fifth
circuit
the
right
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
it
says
furthermore,
even
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
the
right
to
review
our
decisions
in
the
delayed
area,
it
cannot
do
it
because
if
it
does,
its
applying
the
doctrine
of
laches
to
defeat
a
public
right.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
position
on
the
part
of
the
board
is
wrong
and
a
number
of
very
serious
ways.
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
the
statutory
scheme
whether
we’d
be
talking
about
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
whether
we’re
talking
about
the
administrative
procedure
act
contemplates
according
by
the
administrative
agency
the
right
to
judge
itself
fully,
finally
without
review.
it
may
have
the
right,
in
certain
areas
of
expertise,
in
which
it’s
assumed
that
they
have
expert
knowledge
to
judge
the
actions
of
litigants
before
it
but
it
has
no
expertise
when
it
comes
to
judging
its
own
derelictions.
i
say
the
board
is
wrong
about
that.
and
secondly,
on
the
question
of
laches,
it’s
a
principle
case
relied
upon
by
the
board
is
electric
vacuum
cleaner
decision
to
this
court
and
although
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
decision
here
and
it
doesn’t
appear
in
the
circuit
court
decision
the
electric
vacuum
cleaner,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
proceedings
before
the
board
which
i
found,
they’re
not
in
my
brief
but
i
found
them
in
volume
101
of
the
transcripts
of
records
and
copies
of
brief
for
the
october
term
1941,
i
think
its
docket
number
588.
i
found
the
board
proceeding
in
that
case
and
the
board
has
done
in
that
case
precisely
what
it
says,
the
fifth
circuit
can’t
do
in
this
and
this
is
how
that
case
came
about.
in
the
electric
vacuum
cleaner
case,
the
board
issued
a
complaint
and
then
13
months
later
it
issued
a
finding
of
some
sort.
the
company
complained
about
the
fact
that
there
was
a
13
months
delay
and
it
also
complained
about
the
fact
that
the
board
hadn’t
issued
an
intermediate
report
which
procedurally
it
was
suppose
to
have
done.
the
company
filed
a
petition
for
review
under
section
10
(f)
of
the
labor
act
just
as
we
have
done
here
and
the
board
seeing
what
was
developing
withdrew
its
order
which
the
company
sought
to
review
and
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
petition
to
review
because
there
was
nothing
to
review.
sometime
later,
i
think
it
was,
well
i
don’t
remember
the
exact
date
but
it
was
sometime
later
on
that
the
board
then
issued
a
new
order
and
because
of
what
its
secretary
said
in
that
record
was
an
administrative
error
on
the
part
of
the
board
and
because
of
what
the
company
claimed
was
undue
delay,
the
board
excluded
from
the
back
pay
period
a
nine-month
period
and
exactly
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case.
now,
that
position
which
the
board
took
in
electric
vacuum
cleaner
in
the
board
proceeding
was
consistent
with
the
position
which
the
board
took
in
the
injunction
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
at
that
time,
there
was
no
talk
whatsoever
about
the
inability
of
the
board
to
take
its
own
delays
into
consideration
of
fashion
a
back
pay
order.
in
substance,
we
say
that
the
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
issue
orders
which
require
further
definition
than
waiting
inordinate
length
of
time
before
initiating
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
required
to
define
the
company’s
obligation
and
then
second
guess
the
company
on
what
it
did
--
what
it
did
in
its
reinstatement
program
in
the
meantime,
that’s
our
basic
complaint
in
this
case.
i
started
to
make
a
reference
to
something
i
consider
important
and
i
would
like
to
say
it
briefly
because
it’s
not
in
my
brief
and
that
is
i
want
to
make
a
reference
to
section
101.16
of
the
board’s
rules
which
provide
that
after
a
board
order
directing
payment
of
back
pay
has
been
issued
or
after
enforcement
of
such
order
by
a
court
decree,
if
in
formal
efforts
to
dispose
of
the
matter
proved
unsuccessful
the
regional
director
--
regional
director
is
then
authorize
at
his
discretion
to
issue
a
back
pay
specification.
i
consider
that
significant
because
they
didn’t,
they
made
no
effort
to
work
this
out
with
us
at
all,
they
simply
went
in
and
file
the
specification
seeking
$342,000
in
november
1961,
four
years
and
four
months
after
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
enforcing
the
decree
of
reinstatement
with
the
reservation
which
i
have
referred
to
and
the
compliance
officer
for
the
board
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
knew
that
our
letter
that
was
in
the
record
asking
to
be
advised
of
any
deviation
from
the
obligations
of
compliance,
we
were
on
the
record
as
wanting
to
comply
and
he
did
not
make
any
effort
to
discuss
with
us
and
an
informal
resolution
of
all
of
the
problems
which
were
--
which
have
to
be
resolved
before
there
could
be
a
clear
definition
of
what
the
board
order
require.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
sir.
originally,
the
specification
sought
$342,000.
in
the
hearing,
we
eliminated
45
people
in
the
back
pay.
in
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
and
before
the
court,
so
that’s
45
people
that
we
were
right
about.
the
board
order
reduced
the
amount
to
approximately
162,000.
the
order
of
the
fifth
circuit
reduced
it
to
about
90,000
or
95,000
but
there
is
interest
running
since
1964
so
that
i
make
a
rough
approximation
of
the
company’s
obligation
if
it
wins
this
case
is
still
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
$140,000.
that’s
if
we
win
this
case.
now,
if
we
lose
this
case,
what
the
board
intends
to
do
is
go
back
and
file
another
specification
and
try
to
exact
back
pay
from
1961
to
date
i
presume.
mr.
henry
j.
read
we
contended
that
for
this
reason
in
which
we
lost
on
this
point
but
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
i
still
think
i’m
right.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
this
was
the
point
justice
black,
the
board
order
said
to
reinstate
immediately
upon
application.
now,
i
took
the
position
that
this
meant,
that
this
was
prospective
in
nature,
but
we
couldn’t
reinstate
immediately
somebody
who
had
applied
a
year
before
the
board
order.
so
we
took
the
position
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
attempt
to
win
the
case
completely.
that
if,
that
we
were
only
responsible
to
reinstate
those
people
who
applied
prospectively
or
after
the
date
of
the
order,
but
we
lost
on
that
unfortunately,
but
that
is
the
basis
of
the
contention
that
i
made
at
that
junction
that
we
didn’t
know
the
minute
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
interpretation
of
the
order
which
i
think
has
some
relevance
here
as
well
because
its
another
indefinite
aspect
of
the
order.
mr.
henry
j.
read
the
difference
between?
mr.
henry
j.
read
financial?
mr.
henry
j.
read
leaving
out
the
interest?
mr.
henry
j.
read
leaving
out
interest,
it’s
a
difference
if
you
don’t
hold
me
to
accurately
figure
--
mr.
henry
j.
read
--
of
a
162
as
compared
to
about
95.
mr.
henry
j.
read
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
j.
read
that’s
all
the
difference,
that’s
all
the
difference.
mr.
henry
j.
read
well,
we
won
a
lot
of
the
cases
justice
white
on
the
very
issues
that
were
contemplated
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
enforcing
language.
for
instance,
we
won
some
misconduct
cases.
mr.
henry
j.
read
no,
no,
no,
the
specification
claim
342,
the
trial
examiner
ordered
about
a
162.
mr.
henry
j.
read
thus,
the
board
made
some
minor
adjustment
which
is
insignificant,
but
then
when
we
got
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
