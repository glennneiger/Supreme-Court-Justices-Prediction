mr.
arnold
ordman
--
comply
and
indicating,
well
the
record
showed
that
it
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
is.
mr.
arnold
ordman
precisely,
and
the
board
had
and
the
company
had
this
opportunity
and
initiated
no
action.
the
only
request,
the
company
might
come
up
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
the
company
predicates
much
of
his
defense
on
a
letter
it
wrote
in
november
7,
1957
about
two
months
after
the
enforcing
decree.
it
wrote
the
board
a
letter
saying
in
essence,
“we
have
complied
with
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
board’s
order,
now,
will
you
please
notify
us
of
any
instances
where
we
have
not
complied.”
and
the
company
says
on
that
basis
since
we
didn’t
notify
them,
they
weren’t
obliged
to
comply
any
further.
well,
the
court
below
said
an
offending
respondent
which
has
the
primary
obligation
to
comply
can’t
rid
of
itself
of
its
obligation
merely
by
saying
you
didn’t
tell
us.
the
court
had
told
what
they
are
obliged
to
do.
in
addition,
frankly,
we
have
a
situation
where
as
of
this
day,
there
is
still
a
number
or
at
least
of
the
date
of
the
hearing
and
i
believe
that
is
still
true,
there
are
still
the
number
of
strikers
who
have
not
been
offered
reinstatement,
whose
back
pay
claims
after
the
litigation
have
been
validated.
and
to
this
day,
not
one
cent
of
back
pay
has
been
paid
on
this
claims
which
the
board
and
the
court
below
validated.
moreover,
we
notified
the
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
presume
the,
i
presume
the
company
must
be
of
the
waiting
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
which
only
has
to
do
with
cutting
back
the
back
pay
not
eliminating
it.
this
court
denied
cert
on
the
part,
denied
certiorari
on
the
portion
of
the
order
that
was
enforced.
now
also,
this
company
was
rather
familiar
as
the
court
below
says
this
company
was
not
a
babe
in
the
woods,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
court
is
significant
in
this
regard.
and
said
this
company,
this
company
is
not
a
babe
in
the
woods
and
the
principle
theory
of
premise
upon
which
the
court
below
limited
the
back
pay
was
on
the
ground
that
the
court
below,
the
court
below
felt
that
somehow
the
company
had
been
lulled
into
a
sense
by
the
board’s
delay
into
a
sense
that
maybe
it
had
nothing
left
to
do
and
that
it
had
no
obligations
anymore
by
the
board’s
delay.
well,
this
might
come
with
more
grace
i
think.
with
an
unsophisticated
employer,
but
this
is
what
the
court
below
said,
“the
record
convinces
us
that
rutter-rex
is
not
a
babe
in
the
woods
about
to
be
victimized
for
ignorance
or
inadvertent
ineptitude
in
the
field
of
employer-employee
relations
as
regulated
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
the
order
in
this
case
which
directed
immediate
reinstatement
of
strikers
even
if
they
had
to
hire
replacements
who
were
still
employed
by
the
company
although
not
all
strikers
have
been
replaced,
the
order
the
court
below
said
just
could
not
have
been
misunderstood
but
as
of
today,
that
reinstatement
obligation
has
not
yet
been
full
carried
out
and
the
back
pay
has
been
--
none
of
the
back
pay
has
been
paid.
and
as
the
trial
examiner
pointed
out,
at
the
time
of
the
back
pay
hearing,
replacements
were
still
working
and
much
of
the
back
pay
hearing
of
this
long
back
pay
hearing
was
devoted
to
analyzing
the
back
pay
do
strikers
where
replacements
were
still
working
at
the
job
the
strikers
should
have
had.
now,
the
record
demonstrates
as
i
said
before
and
this
is
the
court’s
language,
as
it
was
and
the
impossible
for
the
company
to
comply
and
as
to
many
individuals
it
did.
we
think
that
in
this
situation,
with
this
kind
of
sophisticated
company
in
the
area
of
labor
relations
and
also
represented
as
the
court
below
noted
by
able
counsel
that
they
weren’t
lulled
into
any
sense
that
they’d
already
complied
with
the
decree
of
the
court
below.
on
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
to
just
--
to
affirm
the
board’s
--
the
court’s
order
below
would
be
to
really
reward
a
malingering
and
an
intransigent
refusal
to
comply
with
the
board
order
and
a
court
decree
at
the
expense
of
the
public
policy,
the
act
is
designed
to
bring.
i
might
say
in
regard
to
that
letter
also
where
this,
the
company
tried
to
shelve
its
responsibility
by
a
couple
of
months
after
the
decree
said
you
tell
us
when
we
violated
the
act.
and
now
we
routinely
send
a
letter
and
we
sent
a
letter
right
after
this
decree
to
this
respondent
saying
we’re
ready
to
help
you
comply
with
this
order
and
incidentally
when
you
have
complied,
we
will
send
you
a
letter
notifying
you
that
the
compliance
has
been
affected
and
the
case
close.
and
we
also
incidentally
in
case
the
company
had
any
doubts,
it
had
just
received
such
a
letter
in
an
earlier
unfair
labor
practice
case
where
we
told
them,
in
this
case
you
have
complied
and
the
case
is
closed.
we
never
send
a
closing
compliance
letter.
i
only
want
to
touch
on
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
precisely.
if
it
is
determined
that
a
back
pay
of
that
in
a
particular
employee
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct
because
for
example
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
reinstatement,
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
back
pay.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
order
to
reinstate
all
strikers
is
to
reinstate
them
and
strikers
incidentally,
a
board
order
never
compensates
--
gives
back
pay
to
people
while
they
are
on
strike.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
all
strike
--
of
course
because
in
a
given
situation
as
in
this
situation,
real
problems
do
arise
as
to
whether
a
particular
striker
is
entitled
to
reinstatement,
for
example
in
this
case,
there
were
10
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
there
were
10
that
were
not
reinstated
because
of
misconduct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
where
they
have
an
argument
that
can
be
made
and
this
is
what
the
back
pay
proceeding
is
about,
where
an
employee
has
taken
substantially
equivalent
employment
or
has
refused
substantially
equivalent.
mr.
arnold
ordman
they
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court
have
long
go,
settle
on
the
proposition
that
we
could
either
in
a
case
of
this
kind
with
600
potential
claimants
in
the
initial
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
go
through
the,
in
order
that
the
amount
of
detailed
work
to
determine
respective
rights
or
the
court
stop
at
that
point
and
ask
where
our
order
is
challenged
and
there’s
non-compliance,
get
an
enforcing
decree
because
if
it’s
not
enforced,
we
don’t
have
to
go
through
all
that
proceeding.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
obligation
of
compliance,
the
obligation
of
reinstatement.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
the
one
we
are
speaking
of.
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
is
not,
that
is
not
open
and
shut
to
the
extent
there
are
defenses.
now
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
this
case
is
about
the
large
bulk
of
the
strikers
excluding
those
who
are
engaged
in
misconduct
as
to
which
the
record
shows
the
company
have
no
defense.
mr.
arnold
ordman
this
is
precisely
what?
the
back
pay
proceeding
contemplates
and
the
machinery
is
devised
in
this
court
throughout
and
among
other
cases
in
the
wallace
case
that
the
only
alternative
would
be
to
labor
the
initial
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
with
a
long,
long
involved
hearing
as
to
what
the
individual
rights
are,
and
therefore,
the
original
enforcing
decree
contemplates
that
these
details
about
the
amount
of
back
pay
or
the
occasional
case
for
an
employee
is
not
entitled
to
reinstatement
will
be
resolved
afterwards.
in
other
words,
as
i
think
the
second
circuit
used
the
language,
so
did
the
fourth
that
the
enforcing
decrees
and
the
nature
of
interlocutory
order
which
contemplates
further
procedure.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say,
in
the
first
place,
we
don’t
think
if
the
burden
must
lie
somewhere.
we
think
it
properly
lies
on
the
employer,
on
the
party
that
has
violated
the
law.
mr.
arnold
ordman
he
could
have
brought
a
proceeding
i
suspect
under,
not
i
suspect,
i
believe
firmly,
could
have
brought
a
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
he
relies
upon
to
expedite
this
matter
if
he
felt
the
board
was
guilty
of
malingering.
moreover,
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
request
an
early
hearing,
precisely.
this
lay
an
instrument,
and
reference
was
made
to
this
by
the
court
below
but
we
find
here
that
this
employer
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
may
require
your
honor.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
or
not
conceding
in
any
sense
that
the
board
here
was
guilty
of
culpable
delay.
the
record
sets
this
forth
quite
accurate
--
quite
completely.
the
fact
to
the
matter
was
that
this
record
and
the
public
record
demonstrates
that
the
court,
that
the
board
at
this
time
was
undermanned,
overloaded
with
cases
which
is
this
board
knows,
the
board
initiates
no
cases,
cases
brought
to
it
and
that
we
had
this
case
and
we
had
four
other
compliance
cases
of
a
similar
nature
already
pending
when
this
decree
came
out.
now,
the
court
below
says,
i
suspect
by
hindsight
that
this
was
the
most
important
case
we
had.
i
don’t
know
what
the
basis
of
its
determination
and
said
we
should
have
expedited
this
particular
case.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
at
that
time,
we
are
undermanned,
overstuffed,
frankly,
we
didn’t
want
this
case
here
to
be
frank.
on
the
subject
of
the
delay,
we
don’t
believe
in
delay
and
although
it’s
on
this
side,
i’m
very
happy
to
report
that
as
of
today,
we’ve
leaked
this
very
serious
problem
of
delay
at
least
at
the
administrative
level.
but
this
wasn’t
the
matter
of
culpability
and
if
not
a
matter
of
culpability
or
even
if
we
are
culpable
to
a
minor
degree,
then
we
must
balance
interest
affected,
our
public
interest
into
protecting
the
policies
of
the
act,
the
interest
of
the
employer
here
who
as
i
say
was
not
a
babe
in
the
woods
and
knew
what
he
was
going,
had
great
experience
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
before
the
board,
and
mostly,
the
interest
of
the
employees
here,
though
hadn’t
even
be
detailed
to
this
court.
an
employee
without
back
pay
and
without
reinstatement
suffers
during
this
long
period.
in
paralleling
these
interests,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
alternative
but
not,
that
is
an
overstatement.
we
believe
how
can’t
that
the
court
ought
to
correct
the
error
of
the
court
below.
mr.
arnold
ordman
this
mechanism
was
used
in
one
case
which
is
cited
i
think
both
in
our
brief
and
in
the
respondent’s
brief
in
a
case
where
the
board
had
a
director,
a
second
hearing,
remanded
a
second
hearing
before
the
trial
exam,
the
cases
deering
against
milliken.
the
company
at
that
time
asked
for
relief
and
asked
the
hearing
be
state
completely
because
it
was
unnecessary
dragging
out
this
proceeding
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
i
would
say
simply
gave
the
company
in
that
case
half
the
relief
it
asked
for.
mr.
arnold
ordman
at
minimum
i
submit,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
they
could
have
come
to
us
and
said,
“now
what’s
the
story?
am
i
really
through?
don’t
i
have
to
reinstate
anymore?
don’t
i
have
the
back
pay?”
we
didn’t
get
this
initial
gesture.
of
course,
the
company
says
it
was
our
job
to
come
to
them.
we
want
to
and
we
do
as
often
as
we
can.
we
were
subtle
by
this
very
difficult
burden
which
is
not
only
characteristic
of
our
agency,
i
think
characteristics
of
other
agencies
and
i
think
the
court
sometimes
heavily
oppressed
by
a
laborious
docket.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
if
i
may
have
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
comply
and
indicating,
well
the
record
showed
that
it
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
is.
mr.
arnold
ordman
precisely,
and
the
board
had
and
the
company
had
this
opportunity
and
initiated
no
action.
the
only
request,
the
company
might
come
up
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes,
the
company
predicates
much
of
his
defense
on
a
letter
it
wrote
in
november
7,
1957
about
two
months
after
the
enforcing
decree.
it
wrote
the
board
a
letter
saying
in
essence,
“we
have
complied
with
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
board’s
order,
now,
will
you
please
notify
us
of
any
instances
where
we
have
not
complied.”
and
the
company
says
on
that
basis
since
we
didn’t
notify
them,
they
weren’t
obliged
to
comply
any
further.
well,
the
court
below
said
an
offending
respondent
which
has
the
primary
obligation
to
comply
can’t
rid
of
itself
of
its
obligation
merely
by
saying
you
didn’t
tell
us.
the
court
had
told
what
they
are
obliged
to
do.
in
addition,
frankly,
we
have
a
situation
where
as
of
this
day,
there
is
still
a
number
or
at
least
of
the
date
of
the
hearing
and
i
believe
that
is
still
true,
there
are
still
the
number
of
strikers
who
have
not
been
offered
reinstatement,
whose
back
pay
claims
after
the
litigation
have
been
validated.
and
to
this
day,
not
one
cent
of
back
pay
has
been
paid
on
this
claims
which
the
board
and
the
court
below
validated.
moreover,
we
notified
the
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
presume
the,
i
presume
the
company
must
be
of
the
waiting
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
which
only
has
to
do
with
cutting
back
the
back
pay
not
eliminating
it.
this
court
denied
cert
on
the
part,
denied
certiorari
on
the
portion
of
the
order
that
was
enforced.
now
also,
this
company
was
rather
familiar
as
the
court
below
says
this
company
was
not
a
babe
in
the
woods,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
court
is
significant
in
this
regard.
and
said
this
company,
this
company
is
not
a
babe
in
the
woods
and
the
principle
theory
of
premise
upon
which
the
court
below
limited
the
back
pay
was
on
the
ground
that
the
court
below,
the
court
below
felt
that
somehow
the
company
had
been
lulled
into
a

by
the
board’s
delay
into
a
sense
that
maybe
it
had
nothing
left
to
do
and
that
it
had
no
obligations
anymore
by
the
board’s
delay.
well,
this
might
come
with
more
grace
i
think.
with
an
unsophisticated
employer,
but
this
is
what
the
court
below
said,
“the

convinces
us
that

the
order
in
this
case
which
directed
immediate
reinstatement
of
strikers
even
if
they
had
to
hire
replacements
who
were
still
employed
by
the
company
although
not
all
strikers
have
been
replaced,
the
order
the
court
below
said
just
could
not
have
been
misunderstood
but
as
of
today,
that
reinstatement
obligation
has
not
yet
been
full
carried
out
and
the
back
pay
has
been
--
none
of
the
back
pay
has
been
paid.
and
as
the
trial
examiner
pointed
out,
at
the
time
of
the
back
pay
hearing,
replacements
were
still
working
and
much
of
the
back
pay
hearing
of
this
long
back
pay
hearing
was
devoted
to
analyzing
the
back
pay
do
strikers
where
replacements
were
still
working
at
the
job
the
strikers
should
have
had.
now,
the
record
demonstrates
as
i
said
before
and
this
is
the
court’s
language,
as
it
was
and
the
impossible
for
the
company
to
comply
and
as
to
many
individuals
it
did.
we
think
that
in
this
situation,
with
this
kind
of
sophisticated
company
in
the
area
of
labor
relations
and
also
represented
as
the
court
below
noted
by
able
counsel
that
they
weren’t
lulled
into
any
sense
that
they’d
already
complied
with
the
decree
of
the
court
below.
on
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
to
just
--
to
affirm
the
board’s
--
the
court’s
order
below
would
be
to
really
reward
a
malingering
and
an
intransigent
refusal
to
comply
with
the
board
order
and
a
court
decree
at
the
expense
of
the
public
policy,
the
act
is
designed
to
bring.
i
might
say
in
regard
to
that
letter
also
where
this,
the
company
tried
to
shelve
its
responsibility
by
a
couple
of
months
after
the
decree
said
you
tell
us
when
we
violated
the
act.
and
now
we
routinely
send
a
letter
and
we
sent
a
letter
right
after
this
decree
to
this
respondent
saying
we’re
ready
to
help
you
comply
with
this
order
and
incidentally
when
you
have
complied,
we
will
send
you
a
letter
notifying
you
that
the
compliance
has
been
affected
and
the
case
close.
and
we
also
incidentally
in
case
the
company
had
any
doubts,
it
had
just
received
such
a
letter
in
an
earlier
unfair
labor
practice
case
where
we
told
them,
in
this
case
you
have
complied
and
the
case
is
closed.
we
never
send
a
closing
compliance
letter.
i
only
want
to
touch
on
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes.
mr.
arnold
ordman
precisely.
if
it
is
determined
that
a
back
pay
of
that
in
a
particular
employee
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct
because
for
example
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
reinstatement,
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
back
pay.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
order
to
reinstate
all
strikers
is
to
reinstate
them
and
strikers
incidentally,
a
board
order
never
compensates
--
gives
back
pay
to
people
while
they
are
on
strike.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
all
strike
--
of
course
because
in
a
given
situation
as
in
this
situation,
real
problems
do
arise
as
to
whether
a
particular
striker
is
entitled
to
reinstatement,
for
example
in
this
case,
there
were
10
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
there
were
10
that
were
not
reinstated
because
of
misconduct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
where
they
have
an
argument
that
can
be
made
and
this
is
what
the
back
pay
proceeding
is
about,
where
an
employee
has
taken
substantially
equivalent
employment
or
has
refused
substantially
equivalent.
mr.
arnold
ordman
they
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court
have
long
go,
settle
on
the
proposition
that
we
could
either
in
a
case
of
this
kind
with
600
potential
claimants
in
the
initial
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
go
through
the,
in
order
that
the
amount
of
detailed
work
to
determine
respective
rights
or
the
court
stop
at
that
point
and
ask
where
our
order
is
challenged
and
there’s
non-compliance,
get
an
enforcing
decree
because
if
it’s
not
enforced,
we
don’t
have
to
go
through
all
that
proceeding.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
obligation
of
compliance,
the
obligation
of
reinstatement.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
the
one
we
are
speaking
of.
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
is
not,
that
is
not
open
and
shut
to
the
extent
there
are
defenses.
now
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
no,
this
case
is
about
the
large
bulk
of
the
strikers
excluding
those
who
are
engaged
in
misconduct
as
to
which
the
record
shows
the
company
have
no
defense.
mr.
arnold
ordman
this
is
precisely
what?
the
back
pay
proceeding
contemplates
and
the
machinery
is
devised
in
this
court
throughout
and
among
other
cases
in
the
wallace
case
that
the
only
alternative
would
be
to
labor
the
initial
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
with
a
long,
long
involved
hearing
as
to
what
the
individual
rights
are,
and
therefore,
the
original
enforcing
decree
contemplates
that
these
details
about
the
amount
of
back
pay
or
the
occasional
case
for
an
employee
is
not
entitled
to
reinstatement
will
be
resolved
afterwards.
in
other
words,
as
i
think
the
second
circuit
used
the
language,
so
did
the
fourth
that
the
enforcing
decrees
and
the
nature
of
interlocutory
order
which
contemplates
further
procedure.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say,
in
the
first
place,
we
don’t
think
if
the
burden
must
lie
somewhere.
we
think
it
properly
lies
on
the
employer,
on
the
party
that
has
violated
the
law.
mr.
arnold
ordman
he
could
have
brought
a
proceeding
i
suspect
under,
not
i
suspect,
i
believe
firmly,
could
have
brought
a
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
he
relies
upon
to
expedite
this
matter
if
he
felt
the
board
was
guilty
of
malingering.
moreover,
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
request
an
early
hearing,
precisely.
this
lay
an
instrument,
and
reference
was
made
to
this
by
the
court
below
but
we
find
here
that
this
employer
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
may
require
your
honor.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
or
not
conceding
in
any
sense
that
the
board
here
was
guilty
of
culpable
delay.
the
record
sets
this
forth
quite
accurate
--
quite
completely.
the
fact
to
the
matter
was
that
this
record
and
the
public
record
demonstrates
that
the
court,
that
the
board
at
this
time
was
undermanned,
overloaded
with
cases
which
is
this
board
knows,
the
board
initiates
no
cases,
cases
brought
to
it
and
that
we
had
this
case
and
we
had
four
other
compliance
cases
of
a
similar
nature
already
pending
when
this
decree
came
out.
now,
the
court
below
says,
i
suspect
by
hindsight
that
this
was
the
most
important
case
we
had.
i
don’t
know
what
the
basis
of
its
determination
and
said
we
should
have
expedited
this
particular
case.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
at
that
time,
we
are
undermanned,
overstuffed,
frankly,
we
didn’t
want
this
case
here
to
be
frank.
on
the
subject
of
the
delay,
we
don’t
believe
in
delay
and
although
it’s
on
this
side,
i’m
very
happy
to
report
that
as
of
today,
we’ve
leaked
this
very
serious
problem
of
delay
at
least
at
the
administrative
level.
but
this
wasn’t
the
matter
of
culpability
and
if
not
a
matter
of
culpability
or
even
if
we
are
culpable
to
a
minor
degree,
then
we
must
balance
interest
affected,
our
public
interest
into
protecting
the
policies
of
the
act,
the
interest
of
the
employer
here
who
as
i
say
was
not
a
babe
in
the
woods
and
knew
what
he
was
going,
had
great
experience
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
before
the
board,
and
mostly,
the
interest
of
the
employees
here,
though
hadn’t
even
be
detailed
to
this
court.
an
employee
without
back
pay
and
without
reinstatement
suffers
during
this
long
period.
in
paralleling
these
interests,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
alternative
but
not,
that
is
an
overstatement.
we
believe
how
can’t
that
the
court
ought
to
correct
the
error
of
the
court
below.
mr.
arnold
ordman
this
mechanism
was
used
in
one
case
which
is
cited
i
think
both
in
our
brief
and
in
the
respondent’s
brief
in
a
case
where
the
board
had
a
director,
a
second
hearing,
remanded
a
second
hearing
before
the
trial
exam,
the
cases
deering
against
milliken.
the
company
at
that
time
asked
for
relief
and
asked
the
hearing
be
state
completely
because
it
was
unnecessary
dragging
out
this
proceeding
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
i
would
say
simply
gave
the
company
in
that
case
half
the
relief
it
asked
for.
mr.
arnold
ordman
at
minimum
i
submit,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
they
could
have
come
to
us
and
said,
“now
what’s
the
story?
am
i
really
through?
don’t
i
have
to
reinstate
anymore?
don’t
i
have
the
back
pay?”
we
didn’t
get
this
initial
gesture.
of
course,
the
company
says
it
was
our
job
to
come
to
them.
we
want
to
and
we
do
as
often
as
we
can.
we
were
subtle
by
this
very
difficult
burden
which
is
not
only
characteristic
of
our
agency,
i
think
characteristics
of
other
agencies
and
i
think
the
court
sometimes
heavily
oppressed
by
a
laborious
docket.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
ordman
if
i
may
have
