then
that's
not
striking
to
you
familiar
to
the
last
argument
you
just
heard
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
dissent?
justice
hugo

--
answer
that
by
saying
on
your
assumption
that
you
are
free
to
commit
any
crime
you
want
to
if
you
call
it
a
crime
to
take
advantage
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
not
incriminate
they
say,
and
he
either
had
to
file
the
statement
and
admit
that
he
was
guilty
or
committed
perjury.
that's
what
the
government
said,
you
are
doing
this
you
got
to
report
it,
and
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
be
pretty
good
coercion
to
file
it
and
maybe
the
government
has
the
right
to
coerce
him
into
done
it,
but
i
don't
see
it
can
be
argued
that
it
did
coerced
of
him
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
here
mr.
justice
white.
justice

have
those
cases
cited
in
your
brief?
