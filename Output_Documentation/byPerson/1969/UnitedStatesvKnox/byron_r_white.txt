justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
consider
dennis?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
it
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
whether
it
was
cited
to
the
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had
been
decided
though
at
the
end?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
never
been
considered
by
the
district
court
in
the
light
dennis?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
none
in
one
case
and
gave
a
wrong
number
to
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
recollection.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
didn't
dismiss
this
case
because
on
the
grounds
that
failure
to
fill
out
a
blank
wouldn't
covered
by
title
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
dismissed
the
case
because
the
underlying
statute
is
unconstitutional,
that's
what
he
put
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
this
argue
is
been
here
on
the
next
appeal
limited
to
the
deciding
that
the
issue
that
the
district
judge
decided?
it's
untrue
that
if
he
had
decided
that
this
--
that
the
indictment
should
have
been
dismissed
because
of
construction
of
the
statute,
maybe
that
issue
could've
come
here
too,
but
that
isn't
what
he
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
this
was
dismissed
the
question
of
our
jurisdiction
under
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
rather
think
you
should.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
when
did
he
file
,
when
did
he
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
government
was
putting
that
kind
of
question
on
him
why
the
obligation
to
file
had
been
upheld
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
while
the
government
--
do
they
have
such
dirty
hands
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
marchetti
and
grosso,
do
you
think
they
are
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
haven't
got
grosso
and
marchetti,
we
are
not
having
a
reargument
on
grosso
and
marchetti
here,
are
we,
having
a
review
of
something
else
–
1001?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
therefore,
you
should
not
be
convicted
under
1001?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
seriously
suggest
that
we
could
hold
with
you
and
not
overrule
dennis?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
a
very
--
you
don't
think
it's
very
coerced
if
to
say
that
unless
you
file,
you
got
to
lose
your
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court's
already
also
held
that
if
threats
to
a
--
threats
to
lose
your
job
creates
coercion
too,
when
the
labor
union
official
is
either
filed
or
he
lost
his
job
as
the
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
government's
entitled
or
at
least
the
court
hasn't
said
yet
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
collect
the
tax,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
he
filed
and
said
he
had
three
employees
instead
of
five?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
make
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it
maybe
that
the
government
at
least
claims
that
he
had
five
employees
instead
of
three.
now,
i
suppose
the
government
that
one
the
collect
the
tax
from
him
might
say,
well,
i
guess
he
only
owes
for
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
to
file
it
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
cross
the
evidence
should
be
--
justice
byron

even
if
we
reversed
the
