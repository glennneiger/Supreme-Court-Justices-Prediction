that

the

of
both
in

nobody

you
never

you
have
in

here?

if
the

asked
for
it,
you
could
get
it?

mr.

the

around

justice
thurgood

what
about
this
point
about
the

the
photo

up
the

that
if

goes
back

trial,
there
will
be

does
that

the
point
about

mr.

how

certainly
not.

your

where
was
he
coerced
to
commit
the
crime

don't
we
have
to
here
assume
that
it

don't
you
have
