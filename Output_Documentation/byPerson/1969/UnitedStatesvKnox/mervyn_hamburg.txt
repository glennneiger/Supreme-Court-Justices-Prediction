mr.
mervyn
hamburg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
related
to
the
proceeding
when
--
in
that
involves
a
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
1001
for
making
false
statements
in
purported
compliance
with
other
statutes,
in
this
case,
certain
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
relating
to
wagering
taxes.
the
precise
issue
here
is
whether
an
individual
may
properly
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
complete
defense
to
a
charge
of
making
false
statements
on
wagering
tax
returns.
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
texas
held
that
the
privilege
was
such
a
defense
and
dismissed
false
statement
charges
against
the
appellee,
james
knox.
the
case
is
here
on
the
government's
appeal
of
that
dismissal.
the
indictment
was
filed
before
this
court
decided
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases.
this
indictment
charged
the
appellee
with
four
counts
of
failing
to
file
wagering
tax
returns,
that
is
form
11-c,
a
copy
of
which
we've
included
in
our
appendix,
and
with
failure
to
pay
the
special
occupational
tax,
covering
various
prior
to
october
14,
1965.
the
indictment
also
contains
two
counts,
counts
five
and
six,
which
charge
that
the
appellee
made
false
statements
on
returns
which
he
did
file
on
october
14
and
on
october
15,
1965.
the
statements
being
that
he
declared
under
penalties
of
perjury
that
the
returns
were
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge,
true,
correct
and
complete
whereas
in
truth,
they
were
not
in
that
the
number
of
employees
he
had
claimed
had
been
understated
and
misrepresented.
now
prior
to
trial,
this
court
decided
marchetti
versus
united
states
and
grosso
versus
united
states
and
in
those
cases,
this
court
recognized
that
an
individual
charge
with
failing
to
file
wagering
tax
forms
which
invariably
contained
information
incriminating
him
under
other
laws,
could
properly
assert
that
privilege,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
complete
defense.
thereafter,
the
appellee
moved
to
dismiss
all
of
the
charges
against
him
including
counts
five
and
six,
the
false
statement
counts
alleging
that
such
a
disposition
was
required
as
a
result
of
the
holding
of
the
marchetti
and
grosso.
the
government
responded
that
it
intended
to
pursue
only
counts
five
and
six
and
as
to
those
counts
it
argued
in
effect
that
their
validity
had
not
been
affected
by
marchetti
and
grosso.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
the
government's
position
and
in
a
brief
memorandum,
dated
july
24,
1968,
the
court
--
that
court
held
that
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
prevents
prosecution
for
failure
to
answer
the
form
in
any
respect.
judge
roberts
relied
upon
grosso
in
particular
where
charge
of
conspiracy
to
evade
payment
of
the
excise
tax
on
wagering
was
dismissed
along
with
the
substitute
charges
of
failing
to
pay
the
excise
tax
and
failing
to
pay
this
special
computational
tax.
in
the
government's
view,
judge
roberts
misinterpreted
and
misapplied
the
court's
decisions,
particularly
grosso.
thus
i
believe,
it's
appropriate
to
begin
with
the
discussion
of
the
difference
between
grosso
and
this
situation.
in
grosso,
the
court
held
that
a
conspiracy
charge
had
to
fall
with
other
counts
since
it
was
bottomed
solely
on
allegations
of
invasion
of
the
excise
and
occupational
taxes.
the
courts
words,
the
conspiracy
raise
“questions
identical
with
those
presented
by
the
substitutes
counts.”
in
contrast
to
grosso,
the
false
statement
counts
are
not
identical.
they
are
not
even
similar
to
the
charges
of
failure
to
file
a
wagering
tax
return
or
pay
the
tax.
while
we
no
longer
contest
that
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
an
appropriate
defense
to
one
charged
with
failure
to
file,
we
don't
believe
that
that
privilege
protects
an
independent
act
of
making
a
false
statement
on
a
form
which
the
appellee
did
in
fact
filed.
in
order
words,
the
problem
of
incrimination
arises
at
the
threshold
when
one
decides
whether
or
not
to
file
and
face
--
if
he
files
perhaps,
he
might
face
prosecution
under
some
state
gambling
laws
or
if
he
fails
to
file
prosecution
under
a
federal
statute.
the
appellee
here
resolved
this
question
of
whether
to
stand
on
his
privilege
or
not.
he
didn't
avail
himself
of
the
what
we
believe
to
be
the
customary
means
by
which
statutes
are
challenged
by
non
compliance.
instead,
he
purported
to
comply
and
in
this
purported
compliance,
he
lied.
he
is
now
charged
with
a
substantive
offense
of
making
false
statements
in
violation
of
a
statute
having
no
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
except
insofar
as
the
tax
laws
form
that
framework
within
which
the
appellee
committed
violations
of
this
wholly
distinct
criminal
statute.
thus
in
our
view,
the
fifth
amended
privilege
should
not
control
the
outcome
of
the
case
in
the
district
court.
our
stand
is
not
novel
by
any
means.
a
number
of
cases
decided
in
the
previous
case
argued
here
beginning
with
kapp
and
kay
also
cited
in
our
brief
have
been
controlled
by
a
rational
similar
to
the
one
we
urge
here.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
if
it
did
your
honor,
it's
certainly
didn't
mention
in
its
brief
in
any
way
the
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
and
then,
i'm
sorry,
and
its
appeal
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
cited
to
the
lower
court.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
believe
so,
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
the
government
in
its
reply
in
the
district
court
cited
any
of
the
cases
here,
kapp
or
kay
or
dennis.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
except
insofar
as
dennis
had
been
decided
and
i
assume
that
the
court
was
aware
of
the
holding
in
dennis.
moreover,
certainly
the
same
principles
of
dennis
had
been
used
and
applied
in
kapp
and
kay
insofar
as
this
situation
is
concerned.
these
cases
holding
that
the
uncons
--
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
underlying
statute
doesn't
excuse
a
calculated,
deliberate
course
of
perjury
or
fraud
or
deceit.
in
this
case
by
the
way
of
course,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
claim
that
the
underlying
statute
is
unconstitutional.
we're
only
dealing
with
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
you
could
properly
assert
this
privilege
if
the
lawful
process,
time
tested
process
of
raising
it
when
he
fails
to
comply
and
that
defense
is
all
that
marchetti
and
grosso
established.
but
if
an
underlying
statute
can't
be
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds,
certainly,
an
individual
shouldn't
be
heard
to
raise
a
constitutional
privilege
in
a
situation
where
he
purported
to
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
we
have
in
fact
photo
copy
the
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
statements
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
and
i
have
included
in
the
country
in
our
appendix.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
it
might
need
to
be
quite
awkward
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
is
sufficient
to
indicate
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
indictment
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
it
was
part
of
the
prosecution's
file.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i,
i--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
--
i
really
couldn't
say
whether
it
was
in
fact
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
below
considered
it,
but
i
suppose
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this.
no.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
if
--
its
seems
--
the
indictment
is
rather
awkward,
we'll
be
glad
to
furnish
particulars
at
the
appropriate
occasion
to
explain
any
situation
of
in
artful
drawing,
but
we
certainly
believe
that
the
indictment
states
in
the
sense
that
it
apprises
the
dependent
of
what
he
is
charged
against
and
will
protect
him
from
double
jeopardy
problems.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
it
is
just
there
for
explanation.
we're
concerned
only
at
the
indictment
stage
as
to
what
the
man
has
been
charged
with.
he
point
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
his
--
his
charged
with
making
a
false
statement
and
at
a
trial,
we
are
going
to
show
what
the
false
statement
was
all
about.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
oh,
i
am
not
sure
of
it,
no
one
knew
about
it.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
isn't
discussed
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
he
saw
the
indictment,
yes.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
the
chances
are
that
you
didn't
--
i
really
don't
know
whether
he
do
it
--
did
or
did
not.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no.
he
reached
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no,
i
don't
think
you
do.
we
just
put
it
there
and
just
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
irrelevant
and
there
only
for
exemplar
your
purposes.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
the
principles
here
are
similar
to
the
principles
just
discussed
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
on
any
other
matters,
we
submit
that
the
district
court's
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
counts
five
and
six
ordered
reinstated.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes
sir.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i'll
be
very
brief
your
honor
because
most
of
the
matters
which
been
raised
here
are
replied
to
in
our
reply
brief,
particularly,
the
question
of
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
as
the
marchetti
and
grosso
decisions
themselves
expressly
state
the
wagering
tax
laws
have
not
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
there
is
still
authority
in
the
government
to
require
individuals
to
submit
wagering
tax
returns
admittedly
if
they
will
incriminate
the
individual,
they
may
respond
to
this
requirement
by
not
complying
and
by
--
thereby
if
prosecuted
raising
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
he
has
no
constitutional
license
to
lie
if
he
purportedly
complies
with
the
wagering
tax
scheme.
the
counsel
has
mentioned
something
about
differentiation
here
between
this
case
in
dennis
on
a
matter
of
this
defendant
not
receiving
any
benefits
from
wagering
tax
scheme.
we
submit
that
first
of
all
benefits
–
receipt
of
benefits
is
not
an
element
of
the
false
statements
act.
it
has
been
since
1934
when
the
present
wording
was
adopted
and
secondly
that
we
perceive
some
benefit
to
be
derived
by
under
stating
the
number
of
employees
one
has
in
any
event.
and
finally,
we
submit
too
that
requiring
returns
is
a
definite
function
of
the
internal
revenue
service
--
a
number
of
returns
are
required.
this
one
is
required
by
particular
statute
which
gives
the
internal
revenue
service
jurisdiction
to
require
this
particular
return
and
once
again,
or
whether
or
not
this
it
so,
the
statute
now
before
this
court
is
the
false
statement
statute,
and
whether
this
individual
should
be
prosecuted
under
the
false
statement
statute.
if
there
are
no
questions
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
related
to
the
proceeding
when
--
in
that
involves
a
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
1001
for
making
false
statements
in
purported
compliance
with
other
statutes,
in
this
case,
certain
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
relating
to
wagering
taxes.
the
precise
issue
here
is
whether
an
individual
may
properly
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
complete
defense
to
a
charge
of
making
false
statements
on
wagering
tax
returns.
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
texas
held
that
the
privilege
was
such
a
defense
and
dismissed
false
statement
charges
against
the
appellee,
james
knox.
the
case
is
here
on
the
government's
appeal
of
that
dismissal.
the
indictment
was
filed
before
this
court
decided
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases.
this
indictment
charged
the
appellee
with
four
counts
of
failing
to
file
wagering
tax
returns,
that
is
form
11-c,
a
copy
of
which
we've
included
in
our
appendix,
and
with
failure
to
pay
the
special
occupational
tax,
covering
various
prior
to
october
14,
1965.
the
indictment
also
contains
two
counts,
counts
five
and
six,
which
charge
that
the
appellee
made
false
statements
on
returns
which
he
did
file
on
october
14
and
on
october
15,
1965.
the
statements
being
that
he
declared
under
penalties
of
perjury
that
the
returns
were
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge,
true,
correct
and
complete
whereas
in
truth,
they
were
not
in
that
the
number
of
employees
he
had
claimed
had
been
understated
and
misrepresented.
now
prior
to
trial,
this
court
decided
marchetti
versus
united
states
and
grosso
versus
united
states
and
in
those
cases,
this
court
recognized
that
an
individual
charge
with
failing
to
file
wagering
tax
forms
which
invariably
contained
information
incriminating
him
under
other
laws,
could
properly
assert
that
privilege,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
complete
defense.
thereafter,
the
appellee
moved
to
dismiss
all
of
the
charges
against
him
including
counts
five
and
six,
the
false
statement
counts
alleging
that
such
a
disposition
was
required
as
a
result
of
the
holding
of
the
marchetti
and
grosso.
the
government
responded
that
it
intended
to
pursue
only
counts
five
and
six
and
as
to
those
counts
it
argued
in
effect
that
their
validity
had
not
been
affected
by
marchetti
and
grosso.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
the
government's
position
and
in
a
brief
memorandum,
dated
july
24,
1968,
the
court
--
that
court
held
that
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
prevents
prosecution
for
failure
to
answer
the
form
in
any
respect.
judge
roberts
relied
upon
grosso
in
particular
where
charge
of
conspiracy
to
evade
payment
of
the
excise
tax
on
wagering
was
dismissed
along
with
the
substitute
charges
of
failing
to
pay
the
excise
tax
and
failing
to
pay
this
special
computational
tax.
in
the
government's
view,
judge
roberts
misinterpreted
and
misapplied
the
court's
decisions,
particularly
grosso.
thus
i
believe,
it's
appropriate
to
begin
with
the
discussion
of
the
difference
between
grosso
and
this
situation.
in
grosso,
the
court
held
that
a
conspiracy
charge
had
to
fall
with
other
counts
since
it
was
bottomed
solely
on
allegations
of
invasion
of
the
excise
and
occupational
taxes.
the
courts
words,
the
conspiracy
raise
“questions
identical
with
those
presented
by
the
substitutes
counts.”
in
contrast
to
grosso,
the
false
statement
counts
are
not
identical.
they
are
not
even
similar
to
the
charges
of
failure
to
file
a
wagering
tax
return
or
pay
the
tax.
while
we
no
longer
contest
that
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
an
appropriate
defense
to
one
charged
with
failure
to
file,
we
don't
believe
that
that
privilege
protects
an
independent
act
of
making
a
false
statement
on
a
form
which
the
appellee
did
in
fact
filed.
in
order
words,
the
problem
of
incrimination
arises
at
the
threshold
when
one
decides
whether
or
not
to
file
and
face
--
if
he
files
perhaps,
he
might
face
prosecution
under
some
state
gambling
laws
or
if
he
fails
to
file
prosecution
under
a
federal
statute.
the
appellee
here
resolved
this
question
of
whether
to
stand
on
his
privilege
or
not.
he
didn't
avail
himself
of
the
what
we
believe
to
be
the
customary
means
by
which
statutes
are
challenged
by
non
compliance.
instead,
he
purported
to
comply
and
in
this
purported
compliance,
he
lied.
he
is
now
charged
with
a
substantive
offense
of
making
false
statements
in
violation
of
a
statute
having
no
connection
with
the
wagering
tax
laws
except
insofar
as
the
tax
laws
form
that
framework
within
which
the
appellee
committed
violations
of
this
wholly
distinct
criminal
statute.
thus
in
our
view,
the
fifth
amended
privilege
should
not
control
the
outcome
of
the
case
in
the
district
court.
our
stand
is
not
novel
by
any
means.
a
number
of
cases
decided
in
the
previous
case
argued
here
beginning
with
kapp
and
kay
also
cited
in
our
brief
have
been
controlled
by
a
rational
similar
to
the
one
we
urge
here.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
if
it
did
your
honor,
it's
certainly
didn't
mention
in
its
brief
in
any
way
the
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
and
then,
i'm
sorry,
and
its
appeal
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
cited
to
the
lower
court.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
believe
so,
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
the
government
in
its
reply
in
the
district
court
cited
any
of
the
cases
here,
kapp
or
kay
or
dennis.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
except
insofar
as
dennis
had
been
decided
and
i
assume
that
the
court
was
aware
of
the
holding
in
dennis.
moreover,
certainly
the
same
principles
of
dennis
had
been
used
and
applied
in
kapp
and
kay
insofar
as
this
situation
is
concerned.
these
cases
holding
that
the
uncons
--
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
underlying
statute
doesn't
excuse
a
calculated,
deliberate
course
of
perjury
or
fraud
or
deceit.
in
this
case
by
the
way
of
course,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
claim
that
the
underlying
statute
is
unconstitutional.
we're
only
dealing
with
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
you
could
properly
assert
this
privilege
if
the
lawful
process,
time
tested
process
of
raising
it
when
he
fails
to
comply
and
that
defense
is
all
that
marchetti
and
grosso
established.
but
if
an
underlying
statute
can't
be
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds,
certainly,
an
individual
shouldn't
be
heard
to
raise
a
constitutional
privilege
in
a
situation
where
he
purported
to
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
we
have
in
fact
photo
copy
the
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
statements
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
and
i
have
included
in
the
country
in
our
appendix.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
it
might
need
to
be
quite
awkward
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
is
sufficient
to
indicate
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
indictment
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
it
was
part
of
the
prosecution's
file.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i,
i--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i
--
i
really
couldn't
say
whether
it
was
in
fact
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
below
considered
it,
but
i
suppose
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
the
court
did
not
address
itself
to
this.
no.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
if
--
its
seems
--
the
indictment
is
rather
awkward,
we'll
be
glad
to
furnish
particulars
at
the
appropriate
occasion
to
explain
any
situation
of
in
artful
drawing,
but
we
certainly
believe
that
the
indictment
states
in
the
sense
that
it
apprises
the
dependent
of
what
he
is
charged
against
and
will
protect
him
from
double
jeopardy
problems.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
it
is
just
there
for
explanation.
we're
concerned
only
at
the
indictment
stage
as
to
what
the
man
has
been
charged
with.
he
point
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes.
his
--
his
charged
with
making
a
false
statement
and
at
a
trial,
we
are
going
to
show
what
the
false
statement
was
all
about.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
oh,
i
am
not
sure
of
it,
no
one
knew
about
it.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
isn't
discussed
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
he
saw
the
indictment,
yes.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
well,
the
chances
are
that
you
didn't
--
i
really
don't
know
whether
he
do
it
--
did
or
did
not.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no.
he
reached
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
no,
i
don't
think
you
do.
we
just
put
it
there
and
just
--
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
irrelevant
and
there
only
for
exemplar
your
purposes.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
the
principles
here
are
similar
to
the
principles
just
discussed
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
on
any
other
matters,
we
submit
that
the
district
court's
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
counts
five
and
six
ordered
reinstated.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
yes
sir.
mr.
mervyn
hamburg
i'll
be
very
brief
your
honor
because
most
of
the
matters
which
been
raised
here
are
replied
to
in
our
reply
brief,
particularly,
the
question
of
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
as
the
marchetti
and
grosso
decisions
themselves
expressly
state
the
wagering
tax
laws
have
not
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
there
is
still
authority
in
the
government
to
require
individuals
to
submit
wagering
tax
returns
admittedly
if
they
will
incriminate
the
individual,
they
may
respond
to
this
requirement
by
not
complying
and
by
--
thereby
if
prosecuted
raising
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
he
has
no
constitutional
license
to
lie
if
he
purportedly
complies
with
the
wagering
tax
scheme.
the
counsel
has
mentioned
something
about
differentiation
here
between
this
case
in
dennis
on
a
matter
of
this
defendant
not
receiving
any
benefits
from
wagering
tax
scheme.
we
submit
that
first
of
all
benefits
–
receipt
of
benefits
is
not
an
element
of
the
false
statements
act.
it
has
been
since
1934
when
the
present
wording
was
adopted
and
secondly
that
we
perceive
some
benefit
to
be
derived
by
under
stating
the
number
of
employees
one
has
in
any
event.
and
finally,
we
submit
too
that
requiring
returns
is
a
definite
function
of
the
internal
revenue
service
--
a
number
of
returns
are
required.
this
one
is
required
by
particular
statute
which
gives
the
internal
revenue
service
jurisdiction
to
require
this
particular
return
and
once
again,
or
whether
or
not
this
it
so,
the
statute
now
before
this
court
is
the
false
statement
statute,
and
whether
this
individual
should
be
prosecuted
under
the
false
statement
statute.
if
there
are
no
questions
--
