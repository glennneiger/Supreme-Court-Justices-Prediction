are
you
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so,
we
don't
need
this
photo
stat
copy
of
the
tax
return
at
all
to
decide
this
case.
it's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
totally
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
district
court
didn't
decide
the
case
on
that
ground,
did
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
anybody
brought
that
question
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you
can't
raise
it
first
in
the
brief.
you
must
--
it
must
be
raised
in
accordance
with
the
established
rules.
you
have
a
case
here
decided
on
the
constitutional
point,
not
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
indictment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
shouldn't
be
focusing
on
the
constitutional
issue
only
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
how
was
he
coerced
here,
would
you
clarify
that
for
me?
what
forced
him
to
file
this
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
coupled
with
something
else
if
he
doesn't
file
it
and
does
something
else
affirmatively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
filling
station
operators
of
grocers
have
to
file
this
kind
of
a
return,
this
kind
of
statement
--
gas
station
operators?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
people
are
included
in
the
class?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
people
are
included
in
that
class?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
he
isn't
forced.
he
is
only
forced
to
file
the
affidavit
if
he
wants
to
continue
an
unlawful
activity,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
quite
read
those
cases
that
way
counsel,
but
you
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
really
had
the
third
alternative
that
you
say
it
was
rejected
by
this
court
but
which
i
don't
read,
he
had
the
third
alternative
of
going
out
of
the
illegal
gambling
business,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could've
gone
in
to
an
honest
profession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
are
honest
activities,
isn't
that
something
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
memory
maybe
wrong,
as
i
recall
it
was
a
vigorous
to
say
[attempt
to
laughter]
this
--
category
the
other
case
and
i
think
he
can
raise
that
question,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
in
dissent
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.

that
was
in

–
in

yes.
