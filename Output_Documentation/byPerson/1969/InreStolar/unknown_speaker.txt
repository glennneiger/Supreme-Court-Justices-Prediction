unknown

mr.
boudin,
your
time
is
up
but
i’d
like
to
--
as
i
recall
it,
i
don’t
remember
the
name
the
case
mr.
justice
roberts,
in
an
opinion
for
jehovah’s
witness
stated
many
years
ago
other
things
can
be
attacked
but
beliefs
are
sacred
and
cannot
be
questioned.
if
you’re
trying
that,
i
don’t
remember
the
name
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
this
is
one
relating
to
associations
and
organizations.
i
am
not
exactly
centering
on
it,
your
honor.
i
am
hoping
to
cover
the
entire
area
of
inquiry.
we
feel
that
where
a
lawyer
is
knowingly
associated
with
the
group
dedicated
to
the
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government,
we
consider
it
highly
appropriate
to
inquire
into
whatever
form
his
legal
expertise
will
carry
over
into
the
interpretation
of
his
beliefs
which
maybe
exemplified
by
the
aims
and
the
purposes
of
the
organization.
if
you
were
to
offer
advice,
which
could
be
construed
as
a
condemnation
of
violence
by
a
member
of
legal
profession,
it
might
not
dissimulate
rather
than
inhibit
unlawful
action.
in
this,
i
refer
back
to
a
comment
made
by
the
opposing
counsel
yesterday
when
he
indicated
that
there
must
be
an
impact
upon
the
client
by
virtue
of
the
chilling
effect
upon
an
attorney
or
prospective
attorney
in
belonging
to
organizations.
i
submit
that
there
is
an
impact
upon
the
client
merely
by
virtue
of
the
position
of
somebody
who
has
been
qualified
for
the
practice
of
law.
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
association
of
an
attorney
in
such
an
organization
carries
a
much
greater
significance
than
the
association
of
almost
any
other
professional
man.
i
think
there
are
things
that
you
do
in
your
life
which
changes
your
status,
and
then
therefore
thereafter
people
look
upon
you
by
virtue
of
that
status.
i
guess
they
are
aware
of
that
status.
i
think
that
there
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
say
that
there
are
other
means
of
punishing
unprofessional
conduct
of
an
attorney
because
what
i
am
concerned
about
here
is
it
before
the
fact,
problem
of
advocacy
rather
than
an
after
aftereffect
problem
of
retribution.
mere
advocacy
by
one
unqualified
to
advocate
is
a
far
different
thing
from
the
advocacy
of
one
who
is
qualified
and
his
qualifications
are
certified
by
a
court
who
has
supposedly
tested
these
qualifications.
perhaps
in
the
light
of
what
you
have
heard
me
say
you
can
understand
a
lack
of
comprehension.
on
page
9
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
he
says
the
criterion
of
good
moral
character
is
inapplicable
to
political
activities,
even
if
they
were
to
involve
the
commission
of
crime.
my
question
to
this
court
is,
is
this
good
moral
character
a
part
of
the
lawyer?
isn't
this
court,
what
this
court
said
in
its
majority
decision
in
the
second
konigsberg
case
that
this
honorable
court
said
it
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
argue
that
belief
firm
enough
to
be
carried
over
into
advocacy
to
the
use
of
the
legal
means
to
change
the
form
of
state
or
federal
government
is
an
unimportant
consideration
in
determining
the
fitness
of
applicants
for
membership
in
a
profession
in
whose
hands
so
largely
lies
the
safe
keeping
of
this
country's
legal
and
political
institutions.
i
sincerely
urge
you
to
say
it
again.
thank
you.
