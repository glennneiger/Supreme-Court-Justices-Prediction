justice
potter
stewart
or
what
he
applied
for
was
a
permission
to
take
the
examination
--
justice
potter
stewart
quite
right.
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
ohio
bar
for
a
certain
number
of
years
he
could
have
been
admitted
on
motion
i
think,
is
that
still
true?
justice

there
are
two,
one
beginning
on
page
5a
on
the
record
in
the
appendix
and
the
second
one
beginning
on
page
14a
in
the
appendix.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
who
formulated
this
questionnaire?
justice
potter
stewart
by
court,
it's
the
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
for
the
use
throughout
the
state
and
all
88
counties?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
not
incumbent
upon
each
one
of
the
88
or
you
said
89
committees
to
formulate
its
own
questionnaire
to
do
its
job?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
have
to
fill
up
the
first
questionnaire.
because
the
first
questionnaire
i
think
as
you
have
told
us
was
for
law
students
and
he
and
it's
dated
there
december
of
1968
and
he
even
graduated
from
law
school
on
june
of
1968.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
why
was
this
applicable
to
him
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
you
suggest
there
should
be
no
screening
program
at
all.
i
don’t
understand.
there
should
be
bar
examinations
and
you
said
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
macklin,
before
you
proceed,
did
i
understand
from
your
preliminary
remarks
that
it's
your
claim
that
the
bar
examiners
were
not
given
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
first
amendment
claim
at
all,
that
they
were
confronted
only
with
the
fifth
amendment
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
first
amendment
attacks.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
time
for
the
bar
examiners
to
consider
it
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
something
in
the
nature
of
the
failure
to
exhaust
his
administrative
processes?
justice
potter
stewart
who
wrote
these
questions?
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
the
ohio
legislature
or
the

examining
