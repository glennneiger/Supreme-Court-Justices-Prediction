number
75,
the
application
of
martin
robert
stolar.
mr.
boudin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
link
those
two
propositions
together
in
any
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
last
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they're
not
suggesting
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
the
questions
directed
to
inquiry
about
the
communist
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
get
the
impression
mr.
boudin
that
you
thought
some
of
these
types
of
questions
might
be
appropriate
to
ask
a
candidate
for
the
police
force
but
not
appropriate
for
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
would
--
it
seems
to
follow
the
map
that
you
place
the
policeman's
responsibility
on
a
higher
or
lower
plane.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
is
the
work
in
the
prominent
program
or
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
got
to
do
with
organizations
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
these,
just
one
question,
mr.
boudin,
if
i
may.
were
these
questions
formulated
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
or
by
the
ohio
state
bar
association's
committee
or
by
the
columbus
bar
association?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
state
wide?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
macklin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
question
because
of
its
breadth
has
a
tendency
to
elicit
that
kind
of
an
answer
in
the
exercise
of
the
carrier
that
would
be
duly
this
kind
of
an
application.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
macklin.
i
think
you
have
about
--
i
think
your
time
has
expired,
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
boudin
for
your
submission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.

the
case

chief

e.
burger
we’ll
hear
argument
in
number
18,
in
the
matter
of
the
application
of
the
martin
stolar.
mr.
boudin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
boudin,
basing
on
justice
black’s
question
addressed
i
think
either
mr.
baird
or
his
friend
in
the
earlier
case
which
you
heard,
would
you
think
the
bar
examiners
could
appropriately
ask,
“do
you
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
balance,
not
whether
you’re
a
member
of
any
party
or
committee,
do
you
believe
in
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
speak
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
boudin.
mr.
macklin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
macklin,
had
the
applicant
answered
that
question,
no,
with
the
other
(inaudible)
answer
to
i
think
the
question
13,
about
all
clubs
and
organizations
and
the
7,
all
the
organizations
he
had
been
in
after
he
became
a
law
student,
would
that
have
barred
his
taking
the
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
he
answered
those
questions,
that
i
can't
recall
all
of
the
organizations,
i
have
been
a
member
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
pretty
difficult
matter
to
remember
all
the
organizations
you
have
ever
been
a
member
of,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it's
reasonable
to
think
if
a
man
can
remember
the
organizations
he
joined
in
three
years
of
his
law
school
studies,
but
even
there
that
there
might
not
be
absolute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
attack
on
these
questions
to
the
extent
that
it
is
made
in
any
of
these
cases
as
on
its
there
being
over
broad
and
that
the
question
might
be
acceptable
if
it
said
list
the
names
of
the
organizations
you
have
belonged
to
the
best
of
recollection
or
if
it
permitted
that
qualification.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the

court
of

chief

e.

you
are

now
i
take
it
on
the
failure
to
answer
question
12?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
boudin,
your
time
has
expired.
i
have
one
question
on
that.
do
you
know
how
far
back
these
questions
go?
are
these
questions
prepared
for
the
20
years
ago
or
2
or
3
years?
chief
