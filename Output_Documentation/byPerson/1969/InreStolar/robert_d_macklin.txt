mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
at
the
outset,
it
should
be
understood
that
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
bar
admissions
place
no
burden
upon
the
applicants
approved
his
good
moral
character.
procedures
actually
one
of
the
investigation
performed
by
the
admission's
committees
of
some
89
bar
associations
throughout
the
state.
there's
a
sort
of
a
student
profession
under
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
procedures
of
the
bar
association
committees
are
provided
by
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
committees
are
responsible
for
investigating
the
character,
reputation,
and
the
moral
qualifications
of
the
applicants
and
to
report
their
findings
and
their
recommendations
to
the
court
which
in
the
ultimate
result
determines
whether
the
candidate
shall
be
in
the
first
instance,
registered
as
a
candidate
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
the
law
or
in
the
second
instance,
whether
he
should
be
permitted
to
take
the
bar
examination.
one
process
proceeds
to
the
other.
each
step
of
the
procedure
requires
on
the
part
of
the
applicant
the
submission
of
the
character
questionnaire
which
is
utilized
from
the
local
bar
committee
in
performing
its
investigation.
in
all
the
phase
of
the
form
the
applicant
is
advised
that
the
information
may
be
used
is
a
guide
to
further
investigation.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
it's
my
understanding
that
this
questionnaire
was
formulated
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes
your
honor.
the
various
bar
associations
from
time
to
time
make
recommendations
to
the
supreme
court
for
changes
in
its
rules
affecting
this,
the
admission
procedure
but
to
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
to
the
format
of
the
questionnaires
at
least
for
the
past
five
years.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
your
honor.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
committees
to
further
the
information
that
they
obtain
from
these
questionnaires.
as
an
applicant
from
other
state,
the
petitioner
was
--
did
not
require
registration
as
a
law
student
but
the
petitioner
submitted
both
forms
simultaneously.
when
he
sought
permission
to
take
the
bar
examination
and
the
reason
for
this
of
course
is
the
second
questionnaire
is
primarily
designed
merely
to
bring
up
to
the
basic
information
provided
for
in
the
first
questionnaire.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
two
questions
on
the
first
questionnaire,
one
dealing
generally
with
membership
in
organizations
and
the
other
is
to
whether
he
was
a
member
of
an
organization
which
advocates
to
the
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
this
refusal
was
based
on
this
right
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
on
the
second
questionnaire
which--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that's
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
this
is
applicable
as
a
matter
of
practice
on
the
part
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
itself
for
obtaining
the
basic
information.
if
you
were
to
study
the
questionnaire
design
for
admission
at
the
bar,
you
will
find
that
it
really
merely
supplements
the
basic
information
obtained
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
treats
both
questionnaires
as
a
complete
application.
on
the
second
questionnaire,
the
petitioner
refused
for
the
same
reason
as
on
the
first
questionnaire
to
answer
a
question
about
the
membership
in
club,
societies
or
organizations
since
the
period
registered
as
a
law
student.
after
being
duly
warned,
duly
warned
of
the
effect
upon
the
investigation
of
a
failure
to
answer
these
questions,
the
petitioner
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
answer
and
based
upon
this
refusal,
the
bar
admission
committee
recommended
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
the
petitioner's
application
for
admission
to
the
bar
examination
be
denied.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
approved
the
recommendation
of
the
admissions
committee
and
denied
the
application
of
the
petitioner
to
be
admitted
to
the
march
1969
bar
examination.
petitioner
has
not
raised
an
issue
any
quarrel
with
the
right
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
those
who
they
would
admit
to
the
bar
including
the
moral
fitness
of
such
persons
or
such
person
who
is
to
be
entrusted
with
the
faith
of
clients.
it
follows,
therefore,
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
investigating
the
moral
character
of
its
applicants.
they
consider
it
hand-in-hand
a
part
or
in
parcel
together
with
the
technical
qualifications
for
the
admission
to
the
bar.
and
pursuant
to
this
purpose,
it
must
be
appropriate
to
allow
the
court
to
inquire
into
associations
to
the
extent
that
the
information
acquired
thereby
maybe
an
aid
of
such
legitimate
purpose.
the
function
of
the
higher
questionnaire,
both
questionnaires
for
that
matter,
is
to
provide
the
basic
information
as
a
guide
in
conducting
the
investigation
of
applicants
nothing
more.
there's
no
political
test
involved,
there's
no
oath
of
loyalty
involved,
and
there
are
no
prescriptions
in
mere
membership
in
any
organization.
now,
the
first
of
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
aggregate
effect
is
really
a
conjecture
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
might
do
with
the
kind
of
information
it
seeks
on
these
questionnaires.
not
what
it
has
done
but
what
it
might
do.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
determine
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
mere
possibilities
or
potentialities
of
action
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
surely,
one
may
not
presume
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
not
acutely
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
so
carefully
circumscribed
areas
of
improper
infringement
by
the
states
upon
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
we
don't
feel
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
we
look
upon
disclosure
of
these
associations
as
simply
an
entree
into
the
ability
to
discuss
with
all
the
members
of
these
associations
whether
or
not
there
are
aspects
of
this
person's
character,
his
moral
fitness
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
bearing
upon
his
fitness
for
the
bar.
it's
strictly
a
matter
of
inquiry
or
investigation
and
nothing
more.
we
have
no
history
to
my
knowledge
in
the
state
whereby
a
mere
association
or
mere
membership
within
an
association
has
resulted
in
an
applicant
being
denied
permission
to
take
the
bar
examination.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
members
of
the
organizations
and
the
associates
whom
he
may
have
worked
within
the
organization.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
it
may
be
but
if
there's
no
dissent
intent
to
deceive
upon
his
part
by
excluding
some
organization
with
purposes
to
mislead
the
bar
associations
and
their
examination,
i
can't
think
that
an
innocent
exclusion
would
militate
against
his
acceptance.
i
note
that
most
--
i
have
been
a
member
of
this
admissions
committee,
as
a
matter
or
fact
i
am
a
former
chairman
and
i
can
recall
that
some
applicants
even
included
the
book
of
the
month
club
which
i
didn't
think
was
necessarily
a
bad
association.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
it's
quite
likely.
the
ohio
we
think
that
the
application
of
the
principle
of
the
second
konigsberg
case
is
uniquely
appropriate
here.
the
effect
of
acquisition
was
pointed
out
to
the
petitioner
when
the
investigating
committee
warned
him
of
the
consequence
of
his
refusal
to
answer.
more
importantly,
the
investigating
committee
has
before
it
a
similar
questionnaire
filled
out
by
the
petitioner
in
applying
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
just
a
month
before
he
made
application
to
the
ohio
bar.
in
that
application,
he
answered
the
following
question,
“state
whether
you
have
been
or
are
a
member
of
any
party
or
organization
engaged
in
propagating
or
pledge
to
affect
changes
in
the
form
of
government
supported
by
the
united
states
constitution
or
in
advancing
the
interest
of
a
foreign
country.
if
so,
state
the
facts
fully.”
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that
is
--
it's
contained
your
honor
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that's
contained
on
pages
17a
and
18a
in
the
appendix
there
too.
the
petitioner
responded
no
to
this
question.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
don't
know
that
it
does
sir,
but
it
touches
on
a
great
many
others.
i
don't
believe
that
new
york
has
a
type
of
question
exactly
like
the
one
on
ohio
with
regard
to
the
associations.
we
really
felt
in
ohio,
that
where
the
applicant
or
the
petitioner
had
answered
this
similar
question
at
least
it
has
similar
elements
and
to
those
which
refused
to
answer
in
ohio
on
the
basis
of
his
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
but
he
thereby
created
an
area
of
at
least
let's
say
perplexity
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
charged
with
the
investigation
of
this
moral
character.
the
question
of
course
would
be,
“had
something
occurred
in
the
intervening
(inaudible)
that
would
cause
his
answers
to
the
ohio
questionnaire
to
be
possibly
incriminating?”
it
may
well
be
reasonable
to
logical
explanations
but
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
left
a
complete
void
in
this
particular
area
of
the
investigation
being
performed
by
the
admissions
committee.
the
members
of
the
admissions
committee
were
literally
unable
to
complete
the
full
investigation
and
they
could
not
logically
make
any
recommendation
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
as
to
the
moral
qualifications
of
the
applicant.
we
contend
that
there
was
no
reasonable
alternative
to
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
denying
the
petitioner's
application.
we
submit
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
which
offered
inconsistent
statements
bring
the
fundamental
issue
squarely
within
the
principles
of
the
second
konigsberg
case.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
possibly
would
be
but
i
conceive
of
it,
it
could
possibly
be.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
but
i
think
in
addition
of
this
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
had
an
intent
to
deceive
or
to
answer
incorrectly.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you
sir.
well,
the
fact
--
we
felt
in
this
particular
case
is
even
more
appropriate
to
the
principles
of
the
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
cases,
we
would
urge
that
this
be
the
controlling
point
from
the
standpoint
of
our
state
and
we
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
that
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
again
emphasize
that
we
feel
that
this
case
should
be
considered
with
direct
reference
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
now
you
recall
that
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
questions
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
application
form
for
admission
to
the
bar
on
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
the
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
on
the
face
of
his
application,
this
was
the
sole
basis
for
his
refusal.
we
think
it’s
significant,
but
after
this
fact,
when
he
sought
and
consulted
with
counsel,
he
then
began
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
protections
of
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendment.
then
by
the
process
of
briefs
and
arguments,
we
now
find
ourselves
confronted
with
an
attack
on
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
almost
entirely
related
to
the
first
amendment
rights
and
the
basic
issue
as
first
raised
by
the
petitioner
is
how
relegated
on
minor
independent
ground.
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
argue
this
case
on
any
reasonable
relevant
grounds,
but
we
do
protest
that
as
there
is
a
kind
of
transfer
of
emphasis
which
detracts
from
the
focal
point
of
the
circumstances
which
resulted
in
denying
the
applicant
admission
to
the
ohio
bar
examination.
in
this
instance,
the
petitioner's
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
been
or
presently
was
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
to
the
question
asking
for
a
listing
of
all
clubs,
societies,
or
organizations
of
which
he
had
been
a
member,
clearly
have
raised
in
the
minds
of
the
bar
examiners
questions,
inferences,
suspicions
that
ought
to
be
dispelled
before
they,
in
good
faith,
might
recommend
him
on
the
basis
of
his
character,
his
reputation,
and
his
moral
character
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
i
am
really
saying
is
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
application
itself,
only
the
fifth
amendment
was
raised.
now
it's
quite
true
that
in
the
course
of
letters,
communications
thereafter,
the
fifth
amendment
attack
was
raised.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
i
am
sorry,
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
believe
that
their
consideration
was
based
almost
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
on
the
face
of
the
petition,
on
the
face
of
the
application,
there
was
this
single
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
which
precluded
them
from
further
action.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
i
am
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
trying
to
establish,
if
i
can,
the
fundamental
reason
for
the
rejection,
rather
the
failure
of
recommendation
by
the
bar
examiners
which
we
think
establishes
the
basis
of
the
issue
in
this
particular
case.
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
possibilities
raised
by
the
petitioner's
review
is
certainly
in
the
lines
of
attorneys
and
examiners,
a
specter
at
least,
perjury.
the
petitioner
answered
similar
questions
in
his
application
for
admission
to
the
new
york
bar
without
any
apparent
equivocation
qualification.
potential
for
incrementation
in
responding
to
similar
questions
on
the
ohio
questionnaire,
certainly
at
the
very
least,
raises
a
kind
of
unresolved
ambiguity
in
the
minds
of
the
examiners.
if
among
those
ambiguities,
there
is
the
specter
of
perjury
certainly,
however,
inimical
generally,
it
is
something
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
moral
character
in
the
person
of
an
attorney.
any
propensity
therefore
we
feel
to
be
an
essential
element
of
disqualification
for
the
bar
before
or
after
admission.
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
on
the
particular
grounds
stated,
not
only
raise
the
question,
but
it
precluded
the
answer.
the
bar
commissioners
or
the
bar
committee
rather,
under
the
clear
direction
of
this
court
as
provided
in
the
second
konigsberg
case
and
in
the
anastaplo
case,
based
their
denial
and
said
so
that
the
refusal
to
answer
had
obstructed
a
full
investigation,
and
we
urge
that
your
opinion
relate
to
this
particular
and
what
we
consider
to
be
a
very
single
and
clear
issue.
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
the
constitutional
right
to
raise
these
particular
questions
is,
however,
relevant
to
the
attack
of
the
opposing
counsel.
in
ohio,
we
feel
very
strongly
that
inquiry
into
political
belief,
where
that
belief
may
encompass
illegal
or
criminal
acts
to
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
is
most
emphatically
appropriate
to
the
qualifications
of
an
attorney.
and
we
think
of
this
to
be
of
vital
importance
in
present
circumstances
that
the
agencies,
the
agents,
the
instrumentalities
of
state
and
federal
government
are
being
subjected
or
threatened
by
physical
violence
from
groups
which
are
dedicated
to
the
force
of
the
law
(inaudible),
whether
they
call
it
the
government
of
the
united
states,
a
police
department,
or
the
more
general
vernacular,
simply
the
establishment.
courts
throughout
the
country,
including
our
own
ohio
supreme
court
have
found
it
necessary
to
obtain
the
services
of
uniformed
personnel
to
guard
their
persons
and
their
lawful
sessions.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
had
answered
the
one
particular
question,
no,
and
then
answered
the
other
question
on
the
basis
of
a
fifth
amendment
privilege,
i
think
it
would
still
and
probably
resulted
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well
then
sir,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
this
did
not
preclude
the
further
questioning.
i
am
sure
that
the
bar
examiner
felt
that
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment,
they
were
cut
off
from
further
investigation.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
quite
agree,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
quite
agree
with
you.
this
is
a
question
which
is
a
difficult
one,
if
you
approach
it
word
for
word,
but
may
i
ask
a
rhetorical
question,
is
it
not
within
the
scope
of
the
law
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
may
interpret
and
apply
the
responses
to
these
questions
liberally,
justice
and
reason.
i
am
quite
certain
this
is
what
happened.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
believe
this
is
the
way
the
supreme
court
interprets
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
sir.
it
must
be
because
i
am
virtually
certain
that
within
the
history
of
this
question,
that
no
applicant
has,
or
maybe
some
applicants,
but
very
few
applicants
are
able
to
recall
totally
every
organization,
club.
i
think
that
i
may
have
neglected
myself
to
indicate
that
i
was
a
innocent
duce
17;43
member
of
the
parent
teachers
association,
but
i
believe
that
these
are
innocent
oversights
that
the
court
has
certainly
not
applied
the
very
letter
of
the
question
itself.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
think
it
would
require
an
intent,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
think
it
would
require
a
criminal
intent
which
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
would
draft
to
prosecute
the
case
where
it
was
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
at
the
outset,
it
should
be
understood
that
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
bar
admissions
place
no
burden
upon
the
applicants
approved
his
good
moral
character.
procedures
actually
one
of
the
investigation
performed
by
the
admission's
committees
of
some
89
bar
associations
throughout
the
state.
there's
a
sort
of
a
student
profession
under
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
procedures
of
the
bar
association
committees
are
provided
by
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
committees
are
responsible
for
investigating
the
character,
reputation,
and
the
moral
qualifications
of
the
applicants
and
to
report
their
findings
and
their
recommendations
to
the
court
which
in
the
ultimate
result
determines
whether
the
candidate
shall
be
in
the
first
instance,
registered
as
a
candidate
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
the
law
or
in
the
second
instance,
whether
he
should
be
permitted
to
take
the
bar
examination.
one
process
proceeds
to
the
other.
each
step
of
the
procedure
requires
on
the
part
of
the
applicant
the
submission
of
the
character
questionnaire
which
is
utilized
from
the
local
bar
committee
in
performing
its
investigation.
in
all
the
phase
of
the
form
the
applicant
is
advised
that
the
information
may
be
used
is
a
guide
to
further
investigation.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
it's
my
understanding
that
this
questionnaire
was
formulated
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes
your
honor.
the
various
bar
associations
from
time
to
time
make
recommendations
to
the
supreme
court
for
changes
in
its
rules
affecting
this,
the
admission
procedure
but
to
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
to
the
format
of
the
questionnaires
at
least
for
the
past
five
years.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
your
honor.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
committees
to
further
the
information
that
they
obtain
from
these
questionnaires.
as
an
applicant
from
other
state,
the
petitioner
was
--
did
not
require
registration
as
a
law
student
but
the
petitioner
submitted
both
forms
simultaneously.
when
he
sought
permission
to
take
the
bar
examination
and
the
reason
for
this
of
course
is
the
second
questionnaire
is
primarily
designed
merely
to
bring
up
to
the
basic
information
provided
for
in
the
first
questionnaire.
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
two
questions
on
the
first
questionnaire,
one
dealing
generally
with
membership
in
organizations
and
the
other
is
to
whether
he
was
a
member
of
an
organization
which
advocates
to
the
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
this
refusal
was
based
on
this
right
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
on
the
second
questionnaire
which--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that's
quite
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
this
is
applicable
as
a
matter
of
practice
on
the
part
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
itself
for
obtaining
the
basic
information.
if
you
were
to
study
the
questionnaire
design
for
admission
at
the
bar,
you
will
find
that
it
really
merely
supplements
the
basic
information
obtained
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
treats
both
questionnaires
as
a
complete
application.
on
the
second
questionnaire,
the
petitioner
refused
for
the
same
reason
as
on
the
first
questionnaire
to
answer
a
question
about
the
membership
in
club,
societies
or
organizations
since
the
period
registered
as
a
law
student.
after
being
duly
warned,
duly
warned
of
the
effect
upon
the
investigation
of
a
failure
to
answer
these
questions,
the
petitioner
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
answer
and
based
upon
this
refusal,
the
bar
admission
committee
recommended
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
the
petitioner's
application
for
admission
to
the
bar
examination
be
denied.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
approved
the
recommendation
of
the
admissions
committee
and
denied
the
application
of
the
petitioner
to
be
admitted
to
the
march
1969
bar
examination.
petitioner
has
not
raised
an
issue
any
quarrel
with
the
right
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
those
who
they
would
admit
to
the
bar
including
the
moral
fitness
of
such
persons
or
such
person
who
is
to
be
entrusted
with
the
faith
of
clients.
it
follows,
therefore,
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
investigating
the
moral
character
of
its
applicants.
they
consider
it
hand-in-hand
a
part
or
in
parcel
together
with
the
technical
qualifications
for
the
admission
to
the
bar.
and
pursuant
to
this
purpose,
it
must
be
appropriate
to
allow
the
court
to
inquire
into
associations
to
the
extent
that
the
information
acquired
thereby
maybe
an
aid
of
such
legitimate
purpose.
the
function
of
the
higher
questionnaire,
both
questionnaires
for
that
matter,
is
to
provide
the
basic
information
as
a
guide
in
conducting
the
investigation
of
applicants
nothing
more.
there's
no
political
test
involved,
there's
no
oath
of
loyalty
involved,
and
there
are
no
prescriptions
in
mere
membership
in
any
organization.
now,
the
first
of
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
aggregate
effect
is
really
a
conjecture
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
might
do
with
the
kind
of
information
it
seeks
on
these
questionnaires.
not
what
it
has
done
but
what
it
might
do.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
determine
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
mere
possibilities
or
potentialities
of
action
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
surely,
one
may
not
presume
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
not
acutely
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
so
carefully
circumscribed
areas
of
improper
infringement
by
the
states
upon
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
we
don't
feel
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
we
look
upon
disclosure
of
these
associations
as
simply
an
entree
into
the
ability
to
discuss
with
all
the
members
of
these
associations
whether
or
not
there
are
aspects
of
this
person's
character,
his
moral
fitness
which
may
or
may
not
have
a
bearing
upon
his
fitness
for
the
bar.
it's
strictly
a
matter
of
inquiry
or
investigation
and
nothing
more.
we
have
no
history
to
my
knowledge
in
the
state
whereby
a
mere
association
or
mere
membership
within
an
association
has
resulted
in
an
applicant
being
denied
permission
to
take
the
bar
examination.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
members
of
the
organizations
and
the
associates
whom
he
may
have
worked
within
the
organization.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
it
may
be
but
if
there's
no
dissent
intent
to
deceive
upon
his
part
by
excluding
some
organization
with
purposes
to
mislead
the
bar
associations
and
their
examination,
i
can't
think
that
an
innocent
exclusion
would
militate
against
his
acceptance.
i
note
that
most
--
i
have
been
a
member
of
this
admissions
committee,
as
a
matter
or
fact
i
am
a
former
chairman
and
i
can
recall
that
some
applicants
even
included
the
book
of
the
month
club
which
i
didn't
think
was
necessarily
a
bad
association.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
it's
quite
likely.
the
ohio
we
think
that
the
application
of
the
principle
of
the
second
konigsberg
case
is
uniquely
appropriate
here.
the
effect
of
acquisition
was
pointed
out
to
the
petitioner
when
the
investigating
committee
warned
him
of
the
consequence
of
his
refusal
to
answer.
more
importantly,
the
investigating
committee
has
before
it
a
similar
questionnaire
filled
out
by
the
petitioner
in
applying
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
just
a
month
before
he
made
application
to
the
ohio
bar.
in
that
application,
he
answered
the
following
question,
“state
whether
you
have
been
or
are
a
member
of
any
party
or
organization
engaged
in
propagating
or
pledge
to
affect
changes
in
the
form
of
government
supported
by
the
united
states
constitution
or
in
advancing
the
interest
of
a
foreign
country.
if
so,
state
the
facts
fully.”
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
that
is
--
it's
contained
your
honor
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that's
contained
on
pages
17a
and
18a
in
the
appendix
there
too.
the
petitioner
responded
no
to
this
question.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
don't
know
that
it
does
sir,
but
it
touches
on
a
great
many
others.
i
don't
believe
that
new
york
has
a
type
of
question
exactly
like
the
one
on
ohio
with
regard
to
the
associations.
we
really
felt
in
ohio,
that
where
the
applicant
or
the
petitioner
had
answered
this
similar
question
at
least
it
has
similar
elements
and
to
those
which
refused
to
answer
in
ohio
on
the
basis
of
his
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
but
he
thereby
created
an
area
of
at
least
let's
say
perplexity
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
charged
with
the
investigation
of
this
moral
character.
the
question
of
course
would
be,
“had
something
occurred
in
the
intervening
(inaudible)
that
would
cause
his
answers
to
the
ohio
questionnaire
to
be
possibly
incriminating?”
it
may
well
be
reasonable
to
logical
explanations
but
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
left
a
complete
void
in
this
particular
area
of
the
investigation
being
performed
by
the
admissions
committee.
the
members
of
the
admissions
committee
were
literally
unable
to
complete
the
full
investigation
and
they
could
not
logically
make
any
recommendation
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
as
to
the
moral
qualifications
of
the
applicant.
we
contend
that
there
was
no
reasonable
alternative
to
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
denying
the
petitioner's
application.
we
submit
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
which
offered
inconsistent
statements
bring
the
fundamental
issue
squarely
within
the
principles
of
the
second
konigsberg
case.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
possibly
would
be
but
i
conceive
of
it,
it
could
possibly
be.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
but
i
think
in
addition
of
this
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
had
an
intent
to
deceive
or
to
answer
incorrectly.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you
sir.
well,
the
fact
--
we
felt
in
this
particular
case
is
even
more
appropriate
to
the
principles
of
the
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
cases,
we
would
urge
that
this
be
the
controlling
point
from
the
standpoint
of
our
state
and
we
respectfully
urged
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
that
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
again
emphasize
that
we
feel
that
this
case
should
be
considered
with
direct
reference
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
now
you
recall
that
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
questions
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
application
form
for
admission
to
the
bar
on
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
the
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
on
the
face
of
his
application,
this
was
the
sole
basis
for
his
refusal.
we
think
it’s
significant,
but
after
this
fact,
when
he
sought
and
consulted
with
counsel,
he
then
began
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
protections
of
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendment.
then
by
the
process
of
briefs
and
arguments,
we
now
find
ourselves
confronted
with
an
attack
on
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
almost
entirely
related
to
the
first
amendment
rights
and
the
basic
issue
as
first
raised
by
the
petitioner
is
how
relegated
on
minor
independent
ground.
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
argue
this
case
on
any
reasonable
relevant
grounds,
but
we
do
protest
that
as
there
is
a
kind
of
transfer
of
emphasis
which
detracts
from
the
focal
point
of
the
circumstances
which
resulted
in
denying
the
applicant
admission
to
the
ohio
bar
examination.
in
this
instance,
the
petitioner's
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
been
or
presently
was
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
to
the
question
asking
for
a
listing
of
all
clubs,
societies,
or
organizations
of
which
he
had
been
a
member,
clearly
have
raised
in
the
minds
of
the
bar
examiners
questions,
inferences,
suspicions
that
ought
to
be
dispelled
before
they,
in
good
faith,
might
recommend
him
on
the
basis
of
his
character,
his
reputation,
and
his
moral
character
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
i
am
really
saying
is
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
application
itself,
only
the
fifth
amendment
was
raised.
now
it's
quite
true
that
in
the
course
of
letters,
communications
thereafter,
the
fifth
amendment
attack
was
raised.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
i
am
sorry,
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
believe
that
their
consideration
was
based
almost
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
on
the
face
of
the
petition,
on
the
face
of
the
application,
there
was
this
single
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
which
precluded
them
from
further
action.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
i
am
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
trying
to
establish,
if
i
can,
the
fundamental
reason
for
the
rejection,
rather
the
failure
of
recommendation
by
the
bar
examiners
which
we
think
establishes
the
basis
of
the
issue
in
this
particular
case.
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
the
possibilities
raised
by
the
petitioner's
review
is
certainly
in
the
lines
of
attorneys
and
examiners,
a
specter
at
least,
perjury.
the
petitioner
answered
similar
questions
in
his
application
for
admission
to
the
new
york
bar
without
any
apparent
equivocation
qualification.
potential
for
incrementation
in
responding
to
similar
questions
on
the
ohio
questionnaire,
certainly
at
the
very
least,
raises
a
kind
of
unresolved
ambiguity
in
the
minds
of
the
examiners.
if
among
those
ambiguities,
there
is
the
specter
of
perjury
certainly,
however,
inimical
generally,
it
is
something
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
moral
character
in
the
person
of
an
attorney.
any
propensity
therefore
we
feel
to
be
an
essential
element
of
disqualification
for
the
bar
before
or
after
admission.
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner
to
answer
on
the
particular
grounds
stated,
not
only
raise
the
question,
but
it
precluded
the
answer.
the
bar
commissioners
or
the
bar
committee
rather,
under
the
clear
direction
of
this
court
as
provided
in
the
second
konigsberg
case
and
in
the
anastaplo
case,
based
their
denial
and
said
so
that
the
refusal
to
answer
had
obstructed
a
full
investigation,
and
we
urge
that
your
opinion
relate
to
this
particular
and
what
we
consider
to
be
a
very
single
and
clear
issue.
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
the
constitutional
right
to
raise
these
particular
questions
is,
however,
relevant
to
the
attack
of
the
opposing
counsel.
in
ohio,
we
feel
very
strongly
that
inquiry
into
political
belief,
where
that
belief
may
encompass
illegal
or
criminal
acts
to
bring
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
is
most
emphatically
appropriate
to
the
qualifications
of
an
attorney.
and
we
think
of
this
to
be
of
vital
importance
in
present
circumstances
that
the
agencies,
the
agents,
the
instrumentalities
of
state
and
federal
government
are
being
subjected
or
threatened
by
physical
violence
from
groups
which
are
dedicated
to
the
force
of
the
law
(inaudible),
whether
they
call
it
the
government
of
the
united
states,
a
police
department,
or
the
more
general
vernacular,
simply
the
establishment.
courts
throughout
the
country,
including
our
own
ohio
supreme
court
have
found
it
necessary
to
obtain
the
services
of
uniformed
personnel
to
guard
their
persons
and
their
lawful
sessions.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
had
answered
the
one
particular
question,
no,
and
then
answered
the
other
question
on
the
basis
of
a
fifth
amendment
privilege,
i
think
it
would
still
and
probably
resulted
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well
then
sir,
i
feel
very
strongly
that
this
did
not
preclude
the
further
questioning.
i
am
sure
that
the
bar
examiner
felt
that
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment,
they
were
cut
off
from
further
investigation.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
quite
agree,
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
quite
agree
with
you.
this
is
a
question
which
is
a
difficult
one,
if
you
approach
it
word
for
word,
but
may
i
ask
a
rhetorical
question,
is
it
not
within
the
scope
of
the
law
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
may
interpret
and
apply
the
responses
to
these
questions
liberally,
justice
and
reason.
i
am
quite
certain
this
is
what
happened.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
believe
this
is
the
way
the
supreme
court
interprets
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
sir.
it
must
be
because
i
am
virtually
certain
that
within
the
history
of
this
question,
that
no
applicant
has,
or
maybe
some
applicants,
but
very
few
applicants
are
able
to
recall
totally
every
organization,
club.
i
think
that
i
may
have
neglected
myself
to
indicate
that
i
was
a
innocent
duce
17;43
member
of
the
parent
teachers
association,
but
i
believe
that
these
are
innocent
oversights
that
the
court
has
certainly
not
applied
the
very
letter
of
the
question
itself.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
think
it
would
require
an
intent,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
think
it
would
require
a
criminal
intent
which
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
would
draft
to
prosecute
the
case
where
it
was
