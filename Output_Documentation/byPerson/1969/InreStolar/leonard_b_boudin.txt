mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court,
this
is
a
petition
seeking
review
of
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
denying
the
petitioner
the
right
to
take
the
bar
examination
there
which
is
a
condition
to
admission
to
the
bar.
the
petitioner
was
denied
that
right
because
of
his
refusal
to
answer
three
questions,
a
refusal
based
upon
both
first
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
those
questions
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
five
and
the
top
of
page
six
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
question
12
(g),
“states
whether
you
have
been
or
presently
are
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
if
your
answer
to
any
section
of
the
above
question
is
yes,
set
forth
the
facts
in
detail.”
question
13,
these
are
on
two
questionnaires
says,
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
club,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
have
been
a
member.”
and
question
seven
at
the
top
of
page
six
says,
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
club,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
registering
as
a
law
student.”
i
should
say
that
the
petitioner
had
been
admitted
to
the
new
york
bar
were
then
in
ohio
working
for
a
branch
of
the
office
in
the
economic
opportunity
and
had
applied
for
admission
to
the
ohio
bar.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
when
he
appeared
before
--
when
he
got
this
question
he
declined
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
application
form
on
the
ground
of
what
he
said
was
the
fifth
amendment
and
all
of
us
have
assumed
that
that
meant
for
that
stage
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
subsequently,
in
meetings
with
the
character
committee
members,
he
indicated
that
he
was
also
relying
upon
the
first
amendment
and
that
he
regarded
the
questions
that
were
put
as
not
pertinent
to
it's
qualifications
as
a
member
of
the
bar
--
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar.
and
when
the
character
committee
or
the
members
of
the
committee
eventually
wrote
their
reports,
they
prayed
very
strongly
the
impression
that
this
young
man
had
made
on
them
in
their
interrogation
and
one
of
them
said
that
if
the
rest
if
the
committee
would
not
the
mind
the
fact
he
hasn't
answered
these
questions
i
would
have
recommend
it
as
admission.
but
the
committee
decided
not
to
recommend
his
admission
--
that
is
his
admission
to
the
examination.
and
at
that
stage
while
the
matter
was
appearing,
was
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
he
retained
counsel.
and
counsel
wrote
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
pointing
out
that
the
petitioner
had
raised
first
and
fifth
amendment
grounds
and
that
a
recent
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
what
we
call
the
lscrrc
case,
the
law
students
civil
rights
council
case
now
pending
in
this
court
at
696
and
the
recent
decision
by
a
statutory
court
headed
by
judge
friendly
questions
of
this
very
type
were
found
by
the
statutory
court
to
be
improper
and
to
impinge
upon
first
amendment
rights
and
i
will
develop
shortly
the
respects
in
which
judge
friendly
found
questions
to
this
kind
to
be
improper.
and
the
counsel
suggested
the
desirability
of
appearing
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
arguing
the
matter
instead
of
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
committee
and
to
then
order
appearing
at
page
56a
of
the
appendix
denying
the
application
of
mr.
stolar
to
appear
before
the
bar
--
to
take
the
examinations.
now,
we
--
as
i
indicated
before
i
am
reasonably
satisfied
to
the
extent
that
the
council
could
ever
be
could
prevail
in
this
court
on
the
grounds
indicated
by
judge
friendly
and
in
the
lscrrc
case
and
i
will
turn
to
those
when
i
address
myself
specifically
to
the
questions
put
by
ohio
to
mr.
stolar.
we
think,
however,
that
there
are
more
important
problems,
more
fundamental
problems
relating
to
the
entire
question
of
political
qualifications
if
i
may
use
that
term
for
the
moment,
to
admission
to
the
bar.
and
it's
for
that
reason
our
first
point,
in
our
submission
is
that
political
belief
and
political
association
and
political
advocacy
of
any
kind
are
not
proper
conditions
or
grounds
for
this
qualification
to
admission
to
the
practice
of
law.
as
i
say
i
realize
the
burden
that
i'm
faced
in
presenting
that
proposition
in
the
light
of
several
cases
in
the
court
for
the
assumptions
underlining
those
cases
but
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
before
i
begin
my
argument
on
the
second
and
third
point
which
are
that
the
test
and
the
questions
and
the
procedures
followed
by
ohio
in
this
particular
case
violates
the
rule
of
precision
which
has
been
set
down
by
this
court
in
a
large
series
of
cases
in
the
last
five
or
10
years
where
the
first
amendment
rights
may
be
impinged
upon.
and
my
third
argument
is
going
to
be
very
brief
and
that
will
relate
to
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
answer
the
questions
put
by
a
character
committee.
all
three
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
these
are
completely
independent,
your
honor.
the
last
two.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
last
two
are
completely
independent.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
suggesting
that
too
and
i
will
come
to
that
at
the
last
page
as
i
am
suggesting
the
right
to
assert
privilege
there.
i
want
to
suggest
very
briefly
because
we
have
elaborated
on
our
brief
and
that
we'll
require
a
--
we
hope
a
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
some
of
the
assumptions
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
despite
the
fact
that
they
effectuate
distinguished
by
the
element
of
the
question
of
communist
party
membership
which
one
reason
or
another
has
been
regarded
as
sui
generis
in
this
court.
i
want
to
turn
to
the
first
proposition
which
is
that
it
seems
to
us
that
those
--
that
a
political
test
and
i
may
suggest
even
out
conduct
which
is
unlawful,
although,
obviously
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here,
is
not
related
at
the
proper
functions
of
the
bar.
now,
yesterday
it
as
suggested
by
some
members
of
the
court
that
the
fact
that
some
political
activities
might
be
protected
against
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
made
a
point
deciding
when
brandenburg
against
ohio
was
mentioned
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
persons
engaging
in
those
activities
protected
against
criminal
prosecutions
are
proper
to
admissions
to
the
bar
and
i
wish
to
suggest
that
a
reading
of
keyishian
and
of
elfbrandt
and
robel
and
schneider
against
smith
which
we
have
cited
and
quoted
from
in
our
brief
suggest
the
contrary
that
those
cases
emphasized
a
point
and
in
dealing
with
what
we
think
with
all
due
respect
at
least
a
sensitive
and
more
sensitive
occupations
and
membership
of
the
bar,
namely
work
in
a
defense
plant,
work
as
a
teacher
with
the
young,
work
on
in
a
merchant
marine
and
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
has
said
that
these
are
constitutionally
protected
activities
and
the
constitutionally
protected
activities
cannot
be
a
ground
for
disqualification
from
employment.
now,
our
submission
here
and
i
don't
think
it
has
been
fully
argued
obviously
on
this
argument
i
can't
argue
with
fully
either
is
that
the
profession
of
the
law
is
a
profession
where
these
standards
are
less
applicable
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
it
is
a
lawyer
is
of
course
not
an
employee
of
the
state
and
whatever
power
the
state
has
over
its
employees
should
not
be
applied
to
the
lawyer
and
we
think
to
the
aspirant
lawyer.
the
second
is
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
precisely
what
function
it
is
as
a
lawyer
that
would
be
adversely
affected
by
a
political
viewpoint
or
to
go
with
political
activity.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
questions
of
a
good
private
character,
to
go
back
to
ex
parte
garland
phrase
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief
and
the
question
of
a
bad
public
character
--
a
question
of
a
public
character
which
is
involved
in
the
questions
of
conception
of
whether
or
not
the
state
should
be
overthrown
by
force
and
violence
to
take
the
extreme
situation.
in
other
words,
the
history
of
life
in
this
country
and
in
the
world
generally
had
shown
that
the
most
honorable
persons
have
had
conceptions
and
that
sometimes
attempted
to
carry
up
those
conceptions
into
action.
in
the
political
field,
without
in
the
slightest
way
reflecting
upon
their
good
character
except
when
they
have
failed,
i
suppose,
and
without
if
there
being
any
suggestion
of
the
question
of
moral
servitude
and
i
think
back
specifically
to
the
case
of
ex
parte
garland
where
is
through
the
court
based
its
decision
on
under
the
rubrics
or
on
the
principles
of
bill
of
attainder
and
of
ex
post
facto
law
and
yet
in
that
case
and
in
cummings
against
ohio
we
were
dealing
with
the
most
serious
of
political
crime.
we
were
dealing
with
matters
described
i
think
by
mr.
justice
miller's
dissent
as
reasonable
activities
by
mr.
garland
who,
after
engaging
in
the
fight
against
the
union
on
behalf
of
them
sedulously,
was
admitted
bar
here
or
retained
his
membership
for
the
bar,
i
should
say
and
eventually
became
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
now,
in
short
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
i
think,
when
we
get
to
an
extreme
question
of
assassination
your
honor
it's
always
one
of
those
extreme
problems
that
are
very
hard
to
answer.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
answer
is,
my
answer
would
be
consistent
with
point
of
view,
i
suggest
that
the
committee
could
not
ask
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
is
relevant,
irrelevant
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
consider
that
too,
but
of
course
we're
really
dealing
here
at
the
moment
with
three
kinds
of
things,
belief,
association
and
advocacy
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
even
feel
that
as
far
as
conduct
is
concerned
that
would
be
an
improper
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right
your
honor.
now
i
will
say
that
there
is
a
--
in
other
words,
i
regard
those
as
matters
which
may
reflect
upon
the
which
--
matters
which
should
be
handled
where
we
reach
the
point
of
danger
to
the
community.
handling
the
ordinary
matters
of
due
process
by
criminal
trial
i
don't
regard
those
as
bearing
upon
the
functioning
of
the
lawyer
as
a
lawyer
in
the
process.
i
think
this
is
a
very
different
situation
for
the
policeman
who
was
given
a
gun.
this
is
a
question
for
the
yesterday
i
think
also
and
whom
one
would
expect
because
he
is
given
a
gun
to
have
a
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
gun.
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
a
distinction
between
the
function
of
a
lawyer
and
his
private
capacity
and
the
lawyer
and
his
function
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
i
am
going
to
answer
your
questions
directly,
i
hope,
but
the
difficulty
is
mr.
justice
that
we
really
are
not
dealing
in
reality
in
this
field
if
we
analyze
the
last
20
years
with
the
questions
of
anarchism
or
the
question
of
actual
violence,
we
are
really
dealing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
would
say
that
even
question
would
respect
violence.
if
one
is
talking
about
advocacy
of
violence,
i'm
not
talking
about
conduct
yet.
conduct
i
think
if
it
reaches
a
point
where
it's
punishable,
where
it's
outside
the
first
amendment
protection
and
most
conduct
is
of
course,
then
it
would
be
punishable.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
that
would
come
in
to
the
question
of
what
a
lawyer
would
advice
a
client.
i
think
we're
moving
into
a
different
area.
i
was
dealing
with
a
lawyer
as
a
citizen
and
as
i
was
about
to
say
--
it
is
very
high
as
i
say
to
hit
the
extreme
situation.
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
we're
dealing
with
this
whole
question
of
membership
in
organizations
having
political
philosophies
because
that's
what
these
questions
are
dealing
with.
we
really
aren't
dealing
with
the
extreme
situation
of
conduct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
a
closer
question
when
we
get
to
the
overlapping
and
to
the
conduct
but
i
really
think
that
all
of
these
questions
your
honor,
if
we're
talking
within
the
framework
of
the
reality,
are
questions
that
are
concerned
with
membership
with
organizations
which
have
particular
political
points
of
view.
we
are
really
never
coming
down
to
the
question
--
nobody
ever
asked,
you
are
or
did
you
engage
in
violence,
the
kind
of
question
put
by
your
honor.
but
we're
always
dealing
with
is,
“are
you
a
member
of
an
organization
which
has
for
its
purpose,
which
has
the
literature
behind
it
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?”
because
i
think
your
question
is
a
very
difficult
one
when
i
get
down
to
the
question
of
the
actual
conduct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
do
think
so
your
honor
because
then
i
thought
that
he
had
a
particular
responsibility
and
a
particular
danger
and
that
it
was
his
job
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
just
different
that
is
that
the
policeman
has
to
do
the
law
enforcement
and
i
consider
the
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
often
a
boardwalk
between
his
client
and
the
government
in
reality.
in
reality,
there's
no
point
am
i
giving
your
honor
the
headspring
of
this
thing.
i
think
it's
a
difference
of
function,
not
one
that
is
higher
or
lower
but
i
would
like
because
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
--
part
of
this
argument,
we
move
to
the
point
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white
pertaining
to
the
particular
questions
here
so
as
the
question
here
i
think
clearly
for
under
what
this
court
has
called
the
rule
of
precision
in
the
first
amendment
cases
and
clearly
are
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
statutory
court
which
while
we
have
felt
that
it
has
not
gone
so
far
enough
as
witnessed
by
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
lscrrc
case
we
agree
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
motley
the
dissenting
occurring
opinion
are
nevertheless
one
that
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
particular
case.
the
questions
that
we
have
in
this
case
questions
two
and
three
those
dealing
with
all
organizations
are
questions
which
the
court
has
really
held
improper
in
shelton
against
tucker.
it
held
that
they
go
so
far
as
to
discourage
all
political
associations.
political
association
that
is
completely
legitimate.
and
judge
friendly
pointed
out
your
honors
will
see
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
judge
friendly
pointed
out
that
the
new
york
court,
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
probably
was
aware
of
that
same
questions
that
was
put
earlier
had
withdrawn
such
question
with
respect
to
membership
at
all
organizations
and
at
withdrawing
them
because
of
what
judge
friendly
said
the
awareness
of
the
need
to
bring
them
in
line
with
developing
concepts
of
first
amendment
rights
and
he
referred
specifically
to
shelton
against
tucker
and
schneider
against
smith.
now,
question
number
one
the
question
relating
to
membership
in
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
has
defects
that
i
think
were
recognized
in
some
of
the
questions
here
and
that
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
they
omit
the
absence
of
knowledge
concerning
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
they
omit
the
absence
of
congruence
that
is
membership
at
the
same
time
that
the
organization
had
these
purposes.
in
addition
to
the
two
points
made
by
judge
friendly,
which
resulted
in
new
york
changing
its
question
to
import,
to
include
these
two
elements.
we
suggest
that
the
elements
involved
in
brandenburg
against
ohio
was
suggested
by
that
namely
a
specific
intent
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
organization
with
which
one
and
which
one
is
a
member
are
elements
that
also
should
be
called
for
in
a
question
of
this
kind.
and
our
concern
of
course
is
the
fact
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
question
of
the
communist
party
was
not
involved
in
the
new
york
questionnaire
specifically.
and
as
i
say,
this
court
had
made
its
decision
which
we
would
hope
it
would
reconsider
on
communist
party.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
does
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
i
am
also
suggesting
one
more
thing
your
honor
with
respect
to
communist
party
questions
which
of
course
is
not
the
question
put
here,
it's
a
communist
party
question
is
a
much
more
pointed
question
i'm
suggesting
that
your
honors'
decision
mr.
justice
harlan
in
opinion
and
barenblatt
and
the
opinion
in
gibson
and
perhaps
the
sound
reasons
because
we
are
in
the
first
amendment
area
now,
would
indicate
that
perhaps
even
assuming
that
the
communist
party
membership
question
can
ever
be
put
and
this
in
the
court
we're
willing
to
reconsider
whether
it
should
be
put.
that
kind
of
a
question
should
not
be
put
in
the
absence
of
a
foundation,
some
reason
to
believe
that
there's
of
course
can
make
that
particularly
inquiry
of
an
individual.
of
course,
your
honor
stated
that
view
in
reference,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
draft
of
that
inquiry
in
barenblatt
in
a
different
context.
but
we're
suggesting
that
the
deterrent
affect
upon
association
here
is
one
which
would
require
that
if
even
that
question
could
be
put
it
should
be
put
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
must
admit
that
i
think
that
my
case
could
won
very
easily
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
because
i
think
that
the
public
problem
is
quite
important
and
i
know
that
this
court
could
say
not
only
with
the
case
that
i'm
bringing
here
but
with
the
general
impact
upon
membership
at
the
bar.
and
my
concern
is
that
the
large
amount
of
activities
which
the
court
knows
young
law
students
are
engaging
in
today
activities
in
the
south,
activities
with
the
poor,
activities
with
minority
groups,
a
panoply
of
activities
are
going
to
be
discouraged
and
undiscouraged
if
questions
this
kind
are
submitted
to
be
put.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
really
do
think
so,
your
honor.
when
i
argued
this
matter
before
the
statutory
court
these
judge
bonsal
raised
a
question.
he
sounded
skeptical
also
but
i
may
say
that
if
your
honor
will
see
the
array
of
the
opinion
in
lscrrc.
the
court
eventually
recognize
that
what
i
have
said
what
the
reality
thought
was
we
who
stand
here
you
who
stand
there
are
not
as
close
to
these
young
law
students
who
are
engaged
in
worked
in
vengeance
and
even
i
who
have
been
involved
with
so
many
of
these
cases
in
the
last
decade
are
now
regarded
as
old
had
as
conservatives.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
i
think
one
of
the
--
because
your
honor
the
distinction
is
the
people
who
worked
among
the
poor
or
who
works
among
minority
groups
are
also
in
fighting
against
authority
i'm
using
the
word
fighting
at
a
general
sense.
they
are
regarded
as
dissidents,
they
regarded
as
radicals
and
if
i
can
suggest
your
honor
well
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
here,
your
honor
will
notice
in
our
briefs
what
happened
when
mr.
stolar
appeared
before
the
committee
and
what
the
committee
said
to
him.
they're
not
after
having
gone
through
this
and
the
applicant's
waiting
to
answer
these
generalized
question
of
the
fact
of
nature,
your
honors
will
see
on
page
six
of
my
brief
that
the
committee
pressed
him
into
specific
questions
and
answers
and
that
eventually
he
answered
that
he
had
--
and
these
are
the
words
from
the
committee
“that
he
is
not
now
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
socialist
party
or
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
that
he
has
signed
the
standards
of
the
united
states
preinduction
army
oath
with
respect
to
a
list
of
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.”
in
other
words,
the
people
who
are
engaged
in
work
generally
and
who
are
members
of
the
student
organization
after
another
are
met
by
this
kind
of
specific
inquiry
under
ohio's
program
and
what
reason
is
there
that
they
should
be
asked,
that
a
student
should
be
asked
whether
he
is
a
member
of
any
socialist
party.
all
of
these
arises
as
i
say
in
the
context
of
ohio's
program
and
all
of
these
is
bound
to
discourage
young
men
from
joining
organizations,
from
joining
student
groups
and
what
we
are
doing
ultimately
is
we
are
letting
the
decisions
to
be
made
in
these
things
as
they
must
be
made
i
suppose
by
character
committees
who
makes
for
into
first
amendment
protected
activities
here
and
who
live
in
a
milieu
which
is
so
different
from
the
young
men
who
are
in
the
law
schools
today
and
i
have
talked
that
recently
in
the
law
schools
i
have
been
amazed
in
the
different
quality
of
the
laws
students
that
exist
today
than
those
who
existed
even
10
years
ago.
and
these
students
should
not
be
discouraged
by
questions
that
are
of
this
kind
and
that
are
put
by
ohio
as
to
whether
they
are
members
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
assuming
there
is
such
a
single
organization
today.
they
should
not
be
discouraged
by
asking
whether
they
are
members
of
a
socialist
party.
all
of
these
arises
and
arises
in
the
context,
your
honors
will
know,
that
nobody
has
made
any
determination
such
as
the
court
suggested
in
a
different
context
that
i
think
applicable
here
in
joint
anti-fascist
against
mcgrath,
a
determination
that
an
organization
is
an
organization
which
one
should
not
belong
to.
it
gives
a
freewheeling
suite
to
the
committees
to
make
this
inquiry.
now,
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
although
i
have
suggested
that
ought
to
be,
should
be
reconsidered
by
the
court,
the
court
has
pointed
out
repeatedly
legislative
findings,
legislative
hearings,
judicial
hearings
and
so
forth.
but
with
respect
to
matters
other
than
the
communist
party,
then
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
somebody
must
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
an
organization
is
on
a
particular,
should
be
on
a
list.
if
list
had
to
be
permitted
before
we
are
to
give
committee
the
right
to
ask
questions
concerning
that.
and
of
course,
when
we
ask
questions
concerning
any
organization
you're
even
going
beyond
what
the
court
did
at
schneider
against
smith
when
they
talked
about
250
organizations
and
are
referred
to
the
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
of
mr.
justice
fortes
and
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
know,
perhaps
the
ohio
can
say.
as
far
as
we
know
that
these
are
the
forms
used
and
i
suspect
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
by
the
states,
i
suspect
used
by
the
character
committees
in
many
states
in
the
last
15
to
20
years
not
before,
this
is
something
new.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
seek
review
here
from
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
denying
the
opportunity
to
the
petitioner
to
take
the
ohio
bar
examinations
because
he
refused
on
grounds
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
association
and
belief
and
the
--
his
constitutional
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
against
self-incrimination
both
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
to
refuse
to
answer
three
questions
which
appear
upon
page
5
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
first
question
was
“state
whether
you
have
been
or
presently
are
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
if
your
answer
to
any
section
of
the
above
question
is
yes,
set
forth
the
facts
in
detail.”
the
second
question
is
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
clubs,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member.”
and
the
third
question
on
a
different
questionnaire
was
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
clubs,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
registering
as
a
law
student.”
the
petitioner
answered
the
entire
series
of
questions
on
these
questionnaires.
he
had
been
shortly
prior
thereto
been
admitted
to
the
new
york
bar
was
seeking
admission
to
the
ohio
bar,
he
being
employed
in
ohio
in
a
community
legal
service
organization
under
the
auspices
of
the
ohio.
and
he
declined
originally
to
answer
these
questions
in
writing,
stating
his
fifth
amendment
objection.
when
he
had
an
interview
with
the
two
members
of
the
subcommittee
of
the
character
committee,
they
--
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
relying
either
then
or
shortly
thereafter
by
letter
upon
his
first
amendment
right
of
association
and
upon
being
pressed
however
in
the
oral
examination
that
occurs
with
one
young
man
against
two,
not
very
many,
much
older
members
of
the
character
committee.
he
answered
as
appears
on
page
6
all
specific
questions,
the
committee
appears
to
have
put
to
him,
namely
that
he
is
not
now
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
socialist
party
or
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
that
he
has
signed
the
standard
u.s.
army
preinduction
security
oath
which
has
reference
to
the
attorney
general’s
list,
same
list
that
was
involved
in
schneider
against
smith.
the
committee
as
their
reports
which
are
in
the
record
he
indicate
were
very
much
impressed
with
his
sincerity,
his
ability,
his
forthrightness,
his
reliance
on
principle
and
one
of
them
indeed
said
that
but
for
the
failure
to
answer
on
the
record
made,
he
would
recommend
the
admission
of
the
petitioner
provided
that
his
colleagues
would
do
so.
but
his
colleagues
refused
to
do
so
stating
that
because
the
questions
have
been
asked
and
they
regarded
the
konigsberg
case
as
an
authority
for
these
more
general
questions,
they
would
not
recommend
his
admission
to
the
bar.
the
matter
went
to
the
character
committee
as
a
whole.
the
chairman
wrote
to
the
petitioner.
he
again
declined
to
answer
and
when
the
matter
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
he
then
retained
counsel,
his
present
counsel,
who
wrote
to
the
court,
pointing
out
that
even
under
the
decision
of
the
judge
friendly’s
court
in
the
case
next
before
your
honors
which
had
just
condemned
each
of
these
three
questions
violated
the
rule
of
precision
and
while
counsel
took
issue
with
judge
friendly’s
decision
feeling
that
it
had
not
gone
far
enough
as
mr.
dawson
will
indicate
in
the
next
case,
it
seemed
rather
clear
that
under
judge
friendly’s
decision,
these
questions
were
improper.
the
court
nevertheless
being
obviously
being
to
the
contrary
view,
denied
petitioner’s
admission
to
the
ohio
bar
and
this
lawsuit
resulted.
now,
we
make
three
points.
the
first
is
the
precision
argument,
an
argument
well-supported
by
the
cases
to
which
i
will
develop
unlike
my
last
argument
here
most
of
my
time,
so
that
it
could
be
presented
clearly
to
the
court
because
it
involves
this
very
case.
the
second
is
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
argument
which
has
been
adverted
to
by
mr.
baird
and
i
will
simply
add
several
distinctions
in
terms
of
points
that
could
be
made
between
this
and
spivak.
and
the
third
is
the
argument
that
there
is
no
substantial
state
interest
either
in
the
general
inquiry
with
respect
to
advocacy
and
with
respect
to
membership
and
organizations
with
political
advocacy
regardless
of
what
it
is,
that
the
first
amendment
is
also
a
bar
to
such
questions
and
more
specifically
that
in
this
particular
case,
given
this
record,
no
substantial
interest
has
been
shown
to
justify
the
inquiry
of
the
state.
now
very
briefly,
when
i
went
into
a
long
line
in
my
last
argument
here,
let
me
state
that
these
political
--
these
questions
with
respect
to
political
advocacy
and
political
association,
our
claim
to
have
some
relationship
to
the
question
of
moral
fitness
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
the
law
and
we
agree
of
course
that
the
moral
fitness
is
as
important
of
consideration
as
technical
ability.
but
the
moral
fitness
that
we
think
this
is
relevant
to
is
that
stated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
schwer
where
he
said,
that
from
a
profession
charged
with
responsibilities,
there
must
be
exact
of
those
qualities
of
true
speaking,
of
a
high
sense
of
honor,
of
granted
discretion,
of
the
strictest
observance
of
fiduciary
responsibility
that
that
have
throughout
the
century
been
compendiously
described
as
moral
character.
and
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
konigsberg,
it
is
an
absence
of
conduct
constituting
moral
turpitude.
we
think
and
we
shall
leave
it
really
at
this
point
that
if
one
examines
the
questions
of
this
nature
that
had
been
put
to
the
members
of
the
bar
in
the
1920’s,
the
period
in
which
mr.
chief
justice
hughes,
later
chief
justice
hughes
defended
the
right
of
the
socialist
lawyers
to
be
members
of
new
york
state
legislature,
or
1950’s,
so-called
cold
war
period
or
late
1940’s.
we
see
that
this
question
which
is
directed
to
lawyers
in
a
number
of
states,
is
a
question
that
actually
was
directed
to
every
conceivable
occupation
from
the
piano
tunist
in
the
district
of
columbia
discussed
by
professor
galvan
in
the
book
we
have
cited
to
teachers,
people
in
the
merchant
marine
and
to
the
private
sectors
of
the
motion
pictures,
television,
radio
and
that
the
objective
was
always
the
same
objective.
a
general
fear
in
1920
and
1921
of
the
russian
revolution,
a
fear
in
1947
and
1948
of
an
international
communist
movement
threatening
the
foundation
of
the
society
as
the
court
indicated
in
konigsberg
and
was
not
really
based
upon
any
concern
that
even
communist
lawyers
were
a
threat
to
the
bar.
and
as
i
indicated
in
my
last
argument,
really
when
one
looks
at
the
record
of
those
who
we
think,
so
all
we
can
say
here
were
communist
lawyers,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
clinical
affiliation
or
advocacy
even
in
that
organization
pinpointed
by
konigsberg
presented
a
threat
to
orderly
judicial
processes.
but
again,
while
i
think
that
the
important
principle
is
one
that
ought
to
establish
in
this
case.
i
think
we
can
turn
to
our
case
which
does
not
involve
the
question
of
communist
party
membership
but
involves
the
principle
of
the
rule
of
precision
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
repeated
cases,
some
before
konigsberg,
i
think,
naacp
against
alabama
was
one
of
those
and
many
of
those
after
konigsberg
such
as
the
schneider
and
the
baggett
against
bullitt
and
a
lot.
and
in
those
cases,
the
general
principle
is
that
where
freedom
of
association
or
privacy
may
be
involved,
the
state
even
where
it
has
a
substantial
interest,
that
state
must
use
methods
which
will
minimize
the
effect
upon
freedom
of
association.
and
the
question
is,
has
that
happen
in
the
present
case
with
these
questions,
not
the
konigsberg
question
and
not
anything
else.
now,
we
suggest
your
honors,
that
it
does
not
and
that
this
case
is
clearly
is
clearly
governed
by
schneider
against
smith
and
by
shelton
against
tucker
and
that
all
three
questions
constitute
the
unlimited
indiscriminate
search
referred
to
in
shelton
against
tucker
because
they
call
for
in
one
case
all
organizations
within
a
certain
category
without
naming
them,
leaving
them
to
the
individual
to
figure
out
which
they
are
and
all
club
societies
and
organizations
(audio
cut).
the
court
apparently
in
killion
did
not
feel
any
such
difficulty
and
of
course,
you
also
had
in
konigsberg
as
i
will
evoke
to
later
on
a
specific
finding
made
by
all
three
branches
of
government
as
the
majority
opinion
said
in
361,
with
366
as
second
case,
findings
of
fact
supported
by
this
court’s
decision.
now,
judge
friendly
in
the
new
york
case
found
two
objections
to
question
12
(g).
the
first
question
was
that
it
lacked
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
applicant
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
organization
and
the
second
was
that
it
lacked
contemporaneity.
that
is
concurrence
of
knowledge
with
the
unlawful
advocacy
of
the
organization.
and
so
on,
that
principle,
these
cases
would
be
--
these
questions
would
be
invalid,
that
is
question
12
(g).
in
addition,
we
have
urged
and
this
will
be
developed
further
by
professor
dawson
when
he
argue
the
next
case
because
he’s
directing
his
focus
--
directing
his
focus
on
the
new
york
questions
that
the
elements
which
the
court
has
found
to
exist
as
taking
something
out
of
the
protected
area.
the
elements
based
upon
scales
in
brandenburg,
of
adherence
to
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
not
merely
knowledge,
a
specific
intent
to
advance
them,
the
quality
of
incitement
in
the
advocacy
and
possibly
even
as
brandenburg
held
and
that
was
a
criminal
case,
immanent
danger
to
the
community
that
those
elements
should
be
embodied
in
a
question
if
questions
at
all
are
to
be
asked.
now,
we
have
a
reason
why
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
judge
--
i
should
add,
judge
friendly
did
not
agree
with
those
standards.
he
did
not
believe
--
he
did
not
believe
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
the
brandenburg
test.
i
don’t
think
he
articulated
his
reasons
for
not
believing
it.
now,
we
have
reasons
why
we
think
that
even
all
of
those
elements
brandenburg,
konigsberg,
scales
added
to
these
questions
do
not
solve
the
problem
because
they
represent
a
restriction
upon
association
which
is
deleterious
and
which
is
not
necessary
to
advance
even
the
interest
of
the
state
if
they
regarded
as
substantial
here.
for
one
thing,
the
questions
that
are
put
whether
they
have
the
elements
or
not
require
the
applicant
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
organization
fits
into
one
political
category
as
or
another
and
as
the
court’s
opinions
in
noto
and
scales
and
dennis
have
indicated,
it
is
very
difficult
to
makes
such
a
judgment.
there’s
a
very
thin
line
sometimes
between
unlawful
advocacy
and
lawful
advocacy,
a
line
which
is
at
least
should
be
made
in
a
record
before
a
court,
a
jury
under
judicial
procedures
and
not
one
left
to
the
subjective
judgment
of
the
applicant
how
to
balance
by
the
subjective
judgment
of
his
interrogators.
maybe
young
or
old
members
of
character
committees
but
normally
taken
from
an
area
of
society
to
which
the
applicant
may
not
belong
and
to
risk
the
perjury
prosecution
from
speculation
here,
something
we
think
suggested
at
a
different
context
in
baggett
against
bullitt
where
you
had
vague
questions.
the
risks
of
that
in
this
area
is
something
--
is
a
reason
for
not
using
it
and
for
searching
for
a
different
method
of
interrogation.
we
think
also
the
consequences
of
asking
these
questions,
all
three
questions
that
was
put
last
time
when
i
argued
the
last
that
case
before
judge
bonsal
and
that
is
the
question
with
a
chilling
effect.
a
lawsuit,
not
everyone
but
many,
who
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
asked
these
questions
by
not
a
committee
of
his
peers
but
a
committee
of
older,
more
conservative
gentlemen
perfectly
respectable
areas
just
as
good
he
but
with
a
different
point
of
view,
may
very
well
be
afraid
to
join
organizations
as
a
law
student
or
as
a
college
student.
he
may
get
through
but
why
should
he
take
the
chance,
why
should
he
march
in
a
peace
parade
as
one
man
did
only
to
be
held
up
in
new
york
for
several
months
while
the
character
committee
speculated
on
why
he
marched
in
that
peace
parade.
and
so
a
young
man
will
have
a
tendency
to
say,
“let
me
be
careful,
let
me
clear
out
all
of
this.
if
i
want
to
join
anything,
i’ll
join
that
before
i
become
a
member
of
the
bar,
if
i
want
to
take
that
chance.”
the
second
is
that
we
have
to
think
of
the
independence
of
the
bar
which
is
much
more
than
a
phrase
all
of
us
and
both
sides
of
this
table.
we
want
a
bar
that
is
not
colored
politically
which
doesn’t
have
to
have
passed
a
political
test,
pass
a
test
of
conduct
but
not
a
political
test
of
associations,
of
beliefs,
of
advocacy.
and
finally,
we
have
a
problem
and
the
very
important
problem
of
the
impact
on
the
clients.
there
are
minority
groups.
there
are
black,
there
are
white.
there
are
dissident
groups,
there
are
radical
groups.
many
of
them
think,
sometimes
i
think
mistakenly
that
they
should
have
more
confidence
in
a
lawyer
who
thinks
generally
along
their
lines,
that
they
will
get
a
better,
a
better
assistance
from
such
a
lawyer.
as
i
say,
i’m
not
sure
they’re
right.
but
they
feel
that
way
and
the
question
is
whether
we
are
going
to
say
to
the
young
groups
of
dissident
groups,
minority
groups,
and
dissidents
have
the
wide
range,
we
are
going
to
screen
out
your
lawyers.
we
are
going
to
be
sure
that
the
lawyers
you
get
are
the
kind
that
we
think
ought
to
be
members
of
the
bar
and
those
who
may
very
well
be
more
sympathetic
to
your
purposes
are
the
lawyers
whom
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
have.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
broad
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
believe
that
the
question
concerning
belief,
your
honor,
is
sacrosanct.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
question
can
be
asked.
there
are
people,
there
are
judges
on
the
justices
on
this
court,
there
are
such
eminent
people
as
professor
emerson
who
believed
that
all
advocacy
is
a
form
of
protected
expression.
i
believe
that
too
but
whatever
may
be
the
dispute
with
respect
to
advocacy,
no
one
has
ever
suggested
whether
on
the
political
field
or
otherwise,
and
i
think
the
political
field
is
peculiarly
delicate
because
it
deals
with
doctrine.
it
tells
you
what
writings
you
have
read,
that
belief
must
be
absolutely
protected
from
inquiry.
now,
the
question
that
arises
now
your
honors
is
whether
given
the
picture
that
i
have
given
of
the
reasons
why
we
should
have
a
more
restricted
means
of
inquiry
granted
arguendo
a
substantial
state
interest
here,
isn’t
there
a
means
which
has
a
less
chilling
effect?
and
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
a
less
drastic
means,
to
use
the
term
used
innumerable
decisions
of
this
court,
would
permit
the
elimination
of
screening
of
this
kind
even
one
with
more
specific
and
would
have
a
number
of
other
tests.
a,
if
you
had
to
have
any
screening
at
all.
you
would
have
a
screening
in
which
would
say
that
only
be
with
respect
to
specific
organizations,
organizations
found
by
judicial
writ,
by
take
to
dennis
this
sacb
against
cp
cases
which
i
obviously
disagree
with
but
it’s
still
cases
in
which
the
due
process
aspect,
the
judicial
findings
of
fact
cannot
be
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
will
find
that
by
tomorrow
morning
but
i
subscribe
to
it
even
now.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
please
the
court.
i
indicated
yesterday
three
policy
considerations
why
i
thought
programs
of
this
kind,
requiring
an
advocacy
and
membership
and
advocating
the
organizations
were
not
dangerous,
were
not
the
less
restrictive
means
that
might
be
used.
i
would
add
one
fourth
item,
that
is
the
great
question
as
to
whether
there
really
is
predictability
in
determining
whether
people,
who
have
been
members
of
the
organizations
like
this
are
advocating,
will
turn
out
actually
after
becoming
members
of
the
bar
to
be
in
any
way
deleterious
or
delinquent
in
their
duties.
but
these
four
considerations,
which
i
have
mentioned,
have
led
me
to
two
conclusions
which
i
submit
to
the
court.
the
first
is
whether
assuming
there
should
be
any
screening
program
of
any
kind,
and
whether
there
shouldn’t
be
certain
safeguards
in
order
not
to
have
the
widespread,
wide
ranging
inquiry
and
i
suggest
two
safeguards
to
the
court,
if
we
are
to
continue
with
a
screening
program.
the
first
is
that
the
organization
concerning,
which
an
inquiry
is
made,
is
an
organization
which
has
been
found,
judicially
found,
as
in
konigsberg
to
be
a
organization
engaging
in
unlawful
activities.
this
is,
of
course,
in
wide
contrast
to
the
question
involved
in
this
case
where
the
questions
are
wide
ranging
and
vague.
and
the
second
consideration
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
there
should
be
some
foundation,
some
reason
to
believe
before
this
kind
of
inquiry
is
made
that
the
individual
involved
has
adhered
to
participate
in
the
unlawful
activities
of
such
an
organization.
but,
of
course,
our
principal
point
having
suggested
this
middle
ground,
a
ground
that
we
do
not
--
that
we
prefer
not
to
have
as
against
the
next
one,
is
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
any
screening
program
at
all.
we
suggest
that
in
the
case
of
lawyers,
their
peculiar
susceptibility
to
the
controls
of
the
courts
makes
the
alternative
the
least
less
respective
being
preferable
to
the
question
of
a
screening
program
with
the
dangers
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh
yes,
of
course.
i
meant
the
questions
of
the
kind
with
which
we
are
dealing
here.
i
don’t
need
bar
examinations
to
be
excluded
obviously.
and
the
fourth
point,
your
honors,
which
i
am
suggesting
as
available
as
very
strong,
but
less
restrictive
in
this
sense,
an
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights
are
these.
the
lawyer
himself
is
subject
as
an
officer
of
the
court
as
well
as
his
clients
to
the
contempt
power
of
the
judges
for
whatever
that
he
may
do
in
the
court
room
or
with
respect
to
the
cases.
the
lawyer
alone
is
subject
to
the
very
powerful
disciplinary
proceedings
ending
in
the
dreaded
disbarment
which
is
ruinous.
the
lawyer
in
special
cases
is
subject
to,
of
course,
a
malpractice
suit
by
his
client
and
finally,
as
we
approach
the
area
of
criminal
activities
with
which
we
are
most
concerned,
the
lawyer
is,
of
course,
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
this
would
be
my
general
observation,
unrelated
necessarily
to
the
peculiar
facts
in
our
case.
but
in
our
case,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
think
there
is
neither
obstruction
of
the
process
of
a
kind
that
was
found
by
the
court
to
exist
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
nor
a
substantial
state
interest
requiring
this
petitioner
to
answer
these
questions.
and
i
submit
that
because
as
i
indicated
to
your
honors
in
my
original
presentation,
all
of
the
specific
questions
that
were
put
to
the
petitioner,
including
those
that
were
involved
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
were
answered
by
him
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
committee's
report
that
he
would
not
have
answered
any
other
specific
questions.
it
was
the
general
ones
to
which
he
took
exception.
and
he
took
exception
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
as
a
matter
of
basic
principle
because
the
committee
had
before
it
his
answers
to
many
of
these
questions,
only
slightly
different
worded,
that
he
had
made
in
the
new
york
bar
examinations.
obviously,
the
change
in
position
with
due
to
the
notoriety
that
was
given
to
our
then
pending
wistrik
(ph)
case
which
professor
dawson
will
argue.
so
the
second
point
with
respect
to
substantial
state
interest,
whatever
maybe
the
theoretical
interest
of
a
state,
is
it
not
significant
that
in
this
case
no
explanation
of
a
kind
that
was
given
in
konigsberg
by
the
state
based
on
a
statute
or
in
anastaplo
based
upon
a
rule
of
the
court,
namely
the
concern
about
the
nature
of
the
organization
is
offered
in
the
state's
brief.
the
state's
brief
gives
a
completely
different
theory,
a
wide
ranging
theory
as
to
why
these
questions
are
asked.
and
it
says
three
things;
we
wanted
to
know;
two,
what
organization’s
he
was
a
member
of,
so
we
can
ask
the
other
members
of
the
organization
whether
they
might
not
have
some
information
derogatory
to
the
plaintiff.
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a
census,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
that
would
have
been
to
say
to
the
petitioner
name
every
single
person
you
have
ever
heard
of,
you
ever
knew
in
your
life.
i
submit
that,
that
is
not,
on
our
own
brief,
a
substantial
interest
of
the
state
in
this
case.
now
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
the
second
point,
the
point
has
been
made
by
mr.
baird.
i
will
not
repeat
what
he
said,
except
to
add
two
things
that
he
did
not
mention.
the
first
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
area
of
political
inquiry,
whatever
it
may
be
called,
and
we
have
to
remember
that
in
the
question
of,
this
questions
of
this
kind,
bearing
in
mind
the
historic
origins
of
the
privilege
which
i
certainly
should
not
teach
the
court
that
it
rested
in
religious
and
political
persecutions.
that
this
is
a
peculiarly
good
case,
appropriate
case
whatever
they'd
be
in
other
situations
for
the
association
of
the
privilege.
and
the
second
is
a
point
which
was
made,
as
i
indicated
yesterday
at
baggett
against
bullitt
that
where
questions
are
vague,
they
present
an
appropriate
reason
for
saving
the
privilege
because
of
a
danger
of
a
perjury
prosecution.
even
though
generally
speaking,
obviously,
the
refusal
to
answer
a
specific
on
the
ground
that
it
might
invite
a
perjury
prosecution
is
not
a
proper
defense.
and
i
last
on
this
point
might
refer
to
in
addition
to
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
i
failed
to
mention
in
my
brief
which
is
at
240,
f2nd,
401
in
which
the
chief
justice
participated
as
a
member
of
a
per
curium
court
that
dealt
with
this
problem
of
the
danger
of
perjury
prosecution
in
connection
with
a
vague
question.
it
was
a
contempt
of
congress
case,
your
honor
as
the
chief
justice
i
remember
involving
harvey
o'connor.
this
i
think,
your
honor,
is
subject
to
a
few
answers
is
my
submission.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
appease
the
court.
our
reply
brief
sets
forth
very
clearly
that
the
petitioner
raised
the
question
of
the
non-pertinentcy
of
the
questions,
which
is
clearly
in
the
first
amendment
area.
in
his
interview
with
the
committee
members
and
thereafter
before
he
ever
retained
counsel,
he
is
only
a
little
more
sophisticated
than
the
young
member
of
the
bar,
he
asserted
his
first
amendment
rights
in
a
communication
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
secondly,
the
committee
members
did
not
have
any
impression
from
his
having
made
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment,
which
in
itself
is
a
rather
ambiguous
term
these
days,
since
it
can
comprehend
any
aspect
to
process
self-incrimination
and
so
forth,
and
was
not
the
particularized
in
its
original
answer,
they
do
no
conclusion
with
respect
to
bad
character.
your
honors
will
recall
my
reference
to
mr.
snodgrass,
one
of
the
two
committee
members
who
affirmatively
found
good
character
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
and
the
only
concern
was
whether
or
not
konigsberg
required
that,
because
the
question
was
put,
it
had
to
be
answered,
not
without
reaching
out
to
the
nature
of
the
question.
it's
almost
a
case
of
(inaudible)
state.
we
put
the
question,
konigsberg
might
tell
us,
we
have
right
to
ask
questions,
you
have
got
to
answer
this
or
you
are
obstructing.
now
the
reference
to
political
activities
referred
to
in
my
brief
even
involving
crime,
is
a
reference
to
the
language
in
the
decisions
in
which
i
won't
take
time
to
mention
here
--
quote
to
your
your
honor.
in
cummings
against
missouri,
an
ex
parte
garland
and
the
discussion
of
those
cases
indent
against
west
virginia,
which
analyzed
those
cases.
and
those
happened
to
be
cases
unlike
the
present
situations
involving
activities.
here
we
are
not
dealing
with
activities,
but
we
are
dealing
with
advocacy.
now
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
problem,
it
was
touched
upon
by
friend
here.
it
was
mentioned
yesterday
by
the
attorney
of
arizona,
with
respect
to
what
all
of
us
know,
questions
of
lawyer's
behavior
before
courts
is
not
a
question
of
the
kind
to
which
these
questions,
these
1920,
these
1950
questions
were
directed.
they
were
concerned
about
the
whole
question
of
doctrine
not
about
the
behavior
of
lawyers
in
a
particular
case
and
it
is
a
bootstrap
argument
to
try
to
connect
these
two
things
which
are
not
connected
in
the
minds
of
the
lawgivers.
those
people
who
wrote
these
questions
originally
did
not
face
the
problems
which
all
of
us
know
exist
today.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
bar
examining
committee
presumably
with
the
approval
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
but
it
is
not
a
legislative
inquiry.
now
we
are
all
concerned
about
the
role
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sorry,
i
didn't
check.
i
don't
know
about
ohio,
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
pattern
was
a
1950
pattern
with
some
historical
background
in
1920s,
perhaps
ohio
can
tell
you
honor
on
that
after
checking
it.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court,
this
is
a
petition
seeking
review
of
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
denying
the
petitioner
the
right
to
take
the
bar
examination
there
which
is
a
condition
to
admission
to
the
bar.
the
petitioner
was
denied
that
right
because
of
his
refusal
to
answer
three
questions,
a
refusal
based
upon
both
first
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
those
questions
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
five
and
the
top
of
page
six
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
question
12
(g),
“states
whether
you
have
been
or
presently
are
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
if
your
answer
to
any
section
of
the
above
question
is
yes,
set
forth
the
facts
in
detail.”
question
13,
these
are
on
two
questionnaires
says,
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
club,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
have
been
a
member.”
and
question
seven
at
the
top
of
page
six
says,
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
club,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
registering
as
a
law
student.”
i
should
say
that
the
petitioner
had
been
admitted
to
the
new
york
bar
were
then
in
ohio
working
for
a
branch
of
the
office
in
the
economic
opportunity
and
had
applied
for
admission
to
the
ohio
bar.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
when
he
appeared
before
--
when
he
got
this
question
he
declined
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
application
form
on
the
ground
of
what
he
said
was
the
fifth
amendment
and
all
of
us
have
assumed
that
that
meant
for
that
stage
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
subsequently,
in
meetings
with
the
character
committee
members,
he
indicated
that
he
was
also
relying
upon
the
first
amendment
and
that
he
regarded
the
questions
that
were
put
as
not
pertinent
to
it's
qualifications
as
a
member
of
the
bar
--
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar.
and
when
the
character
committee
or
the
members
of
the
committee
eventually
wrote
their
reports,
they
prayed
very
strongly
the
impression
that
this
young
man
had
made
on
them
in
their
interrogation
and
one
of
them
said
that
if
the
rest
if
the
committee
would
not
the
mind
the
fact
he
hasn't
answered
these
questions
i
would
have
recommend
it
as
admission.
but
the
committee
decided
not
to
recommend
his
admission
--
that
is
his
admission
to
the
examination.
and
at
that
stage
while
the
matter
was
appearing,
was
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
he
retained
counsel.
and
counsel
wrote
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
pointing
out
that
the
petitioner
had
raised
first
and
fifth
amendment
grounds
and
that
a
recent
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
what
we
call
the
lscrrc
case,
the
law
students
civil
rights
council
case
now
pending
in
this
court
at
696
and
the
recent
decision
by
a
statutory
court
headed
by
judge
friendly
questions
of
this
very
type
were
found
by
the
statutory
court
to
be
improper
and
to
impinge
upon
first
amendment
rights
and
i
will
develop
shortly
the
respects
in
which
judge
friendly
found
questions
to
this
kind
to
be
improper.
and
the
counsel
suggested
the
desirability
of
appearing
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
arguing
the
matter
instead
of
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
committee
and
to
then
order
appearing
at
page
56a
of
the
appendix
denying
the
application
of
mr.
stolar
to
appear
before
the
bar
--
to
take
the
examinations.
now,
we
--
as
i
indicated
before
i
am
reasonably
satisfied
to
the
extent
that
the
council
could
ever
be
could
prevail
in
this
court
on
the
grounds
indicated
by
judge
friendly
and
in
the
lscrrc
case
and
i
will
turn
to
those
when
i
address
myself
specifically
to
the
questions
put
by
ohio
to
mr.
stolar.
we
think,
however,
that
there
are
more
important
problems,
more
fundamental
problems
relating
to
the
entire
question
of
political
qualifications
if
i
may
use
that
term
for
the
moment,
to
admission
to
the
bar.
and
it's
for
that
reason
our
first
point,
in
our
submission
is
that
political
belief
and
political
association
and
political
advocacy
of
any
kind
are
not
proper
conditions
or
grounds
for
this
qualification
to
admission
to
the
practice
of
law.
as
i
say
i
realize
the
burden
that
i'm
faced
in
presenting
that
proposition
in
the
light
of
several
cases
in
the
court
for
the
assumptions
underlining
those
cases
but
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
before
i
begin
my
argument
on
the
second
and
third
point
which
are
that
the
test
and
the
questions
and
the
procedures
followed
by
ohio
in
this
particular
case
violates
the
rule
of
precision
which
has
been
set
down
by
this
court
in
a
large
series
of
cases
in
the
last
five
or
10
years
where
the
first
amendment
rights
may
be
impinged
upon.
and
my
third
argument
is
going
to
be
very
brief
and
that
will
relate
to
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
answer
the
questions
put
by
a
character
committee.
all
three
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
these
are
completely
independent,
your
honor.
the
last
two.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
last
two
are
completely
independent.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
suggesting
that
too
and
i
will
come
to
that
at
the
last
page
as
i
am
suggesting
the
right
to
assert
privilege
there.
i
want
to
suggest
very
briefly
because
we
have
elaborated
on
our
brief
and
that
we'll
require
a
--
we
hope
a
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
some
of
the
assumptions
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
despite
the
fact
that
they
effectuate
distinguished
by
the
element
of
the
question
of
communist
party
membership
which
one
reason
or
another
has
been
regarded
as
sui
generis
in
this
court.
i
want
to
turn
to
the
first
proposition
which
is
that
it
seems
to
us
that
those
--
that
a
political
test
and
i
may
suggest
even
out
conduct
which
is
unlawful,
although,
obviously
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here,
is
not
related
at
the
proper
functions
of
the
bar.
now,
yesterday
it
as
suggested
by
some
members
of
the
court
that
the
fact
that
some
political
activities
might
be
protected
against
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
made
a
point
deciding
when
brandenburg
against
ohio
was
mentioned
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
persons
engaging
in
those
activities
protected
against
criminal
prosecutions
are
proper
to
admissions
to
the
bar
and
i
wish
to
suggest
that
a
reading
of
keyishian
and
of
elfbrandt
and
robel
and
schneider
against
smith
which
we
have
cited
and
quoted
from
in
our
brief
suggest
the
contrary
that
those
cases
emphasized
a
point
and
in
dealing
with
what
we
think
with
all
due
respect
at
least
a
sensitive
and
more
sensitive
occupations
and
membership
of
the
bar,
namely
work
in
a
defense
plant,
work
as
a
teacher
with
the
young,
work
on
in
a
merchant
marine
and
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
has
said
that
these
are
constitutionally
protected
activities
and
the
constitutionally
protected
activities
cannot
be
a
ground
for
disqualification
from
employment.
now,
our
submission
here
and
i
don't
think
it
has
been
fully
argued
obviously
on
this
argument
i
can't
argue
with
fully
either
is
that
the
profession
of
the
law
is
a
profession
where
these
standards
are
less
applicable
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
it
is
a
lawyer
is
of
course
not
an
employee
of
the
state
and
whatever
power
the
state
has
over
its
employees
should
not
be
applied
to
the
lawyer
and
we
think
to
the
aspirant
lawyer.
the
second
is
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
precisely
what
function
it
is
as
a
lawyer
that
would
be
adversely
affected
by
a
political
viewpoint
or
to
go
with
political
activity.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
questions
of
a
good
private
character,
to
go
back
to
ex
parte
garland
phrase
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief
and
the
question
of
a
bad
public
character
--
a
question
of
a
public
character
which
is
involved
in
the
questions
of
conception
of
whether
or
not
the
state
should
be
overthrown
by
force
and
violence
to
take
the
extreme
situation.
in
other
words,
the
history
of
life
in
this
country
and
in
the
world
generally
had
shown
that
the
most
honorable
persons
have
had
conceptions
and
that
sometimes
attempted
to
carry
up
those
conceptions
into
action.
in
the
political
field,
without
in
the
slightest
way
reflecting
upon
their
good
character
except
when
they
have
failed,
i
suppose,
and
without
if
there
being
any
suggestion
of
the
question
of
moral
servitude
and
i
think
back
specifically
to
the
case
of
ex
parte
garland
where
is
through
the
court
based
its
decision
on
under
the
rubrics
or
on
the
principles
of
bill
of
attainder
and
of
ex
post
facto
law
and
yet
in
that
case
and
in
cummings
against
ohio
we
were
dealing
with
the
most
serious
of
political
crime.
we
were
dealing
with
matters
described
i
think
by
mr.
justice
miller's
dissent
as
reasonable
activities
by
mr.
garland
who,
after
engaging
in
the
fight
against
the
union
on
behalf
of
them
sedulously,
was
admitted
bar
here
or
retained
his
membership
for
the
bar,
i
should
say
and
eventually
became
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
now,
in
short
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
i
think,
when
we
get
to
an
extreme
question
of
assassination
your
honor
it's
always
one
of
those
extreme
problems
that
are
very
hard
to
answer.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
answer
is,
my
answer
would
be
consistent
with
point
of
view,
i
suggest
that
the
committee
could
not
ask
that
kind
of
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
is
relevant,
irrelevant
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
consider
that
too,
but
of
course
we're
really
dealing
here
at
the
moment
with
three
kinds
of
things,
belief,
association
and
advocacy
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
even
feel
that
as
far
as
conduct
is
concerned
that
would
be
an
improper
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
right
your
honor.
now
i
will
say
that
there
is
a
--
in
other
words,
i
regard
those
as
matters
which
may
reflect
upon
the
which
--
matters
which
should
be
handled
where
we
reach
the
point
of
danger
to
the
community.
handling
the
ordinary
matters
of
due
process
by
criminal
trial
i
don't
regard
those
as
bearing
upon
the
functioning
of
the
lawyer
as
a
lawyer
in
the
process.
i
think
this
is
a
very
different
situation
for
the
policeman
who
was
given
a
gun.
this
is
a
question
for
the
yesterday
i
think
also
and
whom
one
would
expect
because
he
is
given
a
gun
to
have
a
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
gun.
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
a
distinction
between
the
function
of
a
lawyer
and
his
private
capacity
and
the
lawyer
and
his
function
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
i
am
going
to
answer
your
questions
directly,
i
hope,
but
the
difficulty
is
mr.
justice
that
we
really
are
not
dealing
in
reality
in
this
field
if
we
analyze
the
last
20
years
with
the
questions
of
anarchism
or
the
question
of
actual
violence,
we
are
really
dealing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
would
say
that
even
question
would
respect
violence.
if
one
is
talking
about
advocacy
of
violence,
i'm
not
talking
about
conduct
yet.
conduct
i
think
if
it
reaches
a
point
where
it's
punishable,
where
it's
outside
the
first
amendment
protection
and
most
conduct
is
of
course,
then
it
would
be
punishable.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
that
would
come
in
to
the
question
of
what
a
lawyer
would
advice
a
client.
i
think
we're
moving
into
a
different
area.
i
was
dealing
with
a
lawyer
as
a
citizen
and
as
i
was
about
to
say
--
it
is
very
high
as
i
say
to
hit
the
extreme
situation.
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
we're
dealing
with
this
whole
question
of
membership
in
organizations
having
political
philosophies
because
that's
what
these
questions
are
dealing
with.
we
really
aren't
dealing
with
the
extreme
situation
of
conduct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
a
closer
question
when
we
get
to
the
overlapping
and
to
the
conduct
but
i
really
think
that
all
of
these
questions
your
honor,
if
we're
talking
within
the
framework
of
the
reality,
are
questions
that
are
concerned
with
membership
with
organizations
which
have
particular
political
points
of
view.
we
are
really
never
coming
down
to
the
question
--
nobody
ever
asked,
you
are
or
did
you
engage
in
violence,
the
kind
of
question
put
by
your
honor.
but
we're
always
dealing
with
is,
“are
you
a
member
of
an
organization
which
has
for
its
purpose,
which
has
the
literature
behind
it
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence?”
because
i
think
your
question
is
a
very
difficult
one
when
i
get
down
to
the
question
of
the
actual
conduct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
do
think
so
your
honor
because
then
i
thought
that
he
had
a
particular
responsibility
and
a
particular
danger
and
that
it
was
his
job
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
just
different
that
is
that
the
policeman
has
to
do
the
law
enforcement
and
i
consider
the
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
often
a
boardwalk
between
his
client
and
the
government
in
reality.
in
reality,
there's
no
point
am
i
giving
your
honor
the
headspring
of
this
thing.
i
think
it's
a
difference
of
function,
not
one
that
is
higher
or
lower
but
i
would
like
because
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
--
part
of
this
argument,
we
move
to
the
point
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white
pertaining
to
the
particular
questions
here
so
as
the
question
here
i
think
clearly
for
under
what
this
court
has
called
the
rule
of
precision
in
the
first
amendment
cases
and
clearly
are
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
statutory
court
which
while
we
have
felt
that
it
has
not
gone
so
far
enough
as
witnessed
by
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
lscrrc
case
we
agree
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
motley
the
dissenting
occurring
opinion
are
nevertheless
one
that
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
particular
case.
the
questions
that
we
have
in
this
case
questions
two
and
three
those
dealing
with
all
organizations
are
questions
which
the
court
has
really
held
improper
in
shelton
against
tucker.
it
held
that
they
go
so
far
as
to
discourage
all
political
associations.
political
association
that
is
completely
legitimate.
and
judge
friendly
pointed
out
your
honors
will
see
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
judge
friendly
pointed
out
that
the
new
york
court,
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
probably
was
aware
of
that
same
questions
that
was
put
earlier
had
withdrawn
such
question
with
respect
to
membership
at
all
organizations
and
at
withdrawing
them
because
of
what
judge
friendly
said
the
awareness
of
the
need
to
bring
them
in
line
with
developing
concepts
of
first
amendment
rights
and
he
referred
specifically
to
shelton
against
tucker
and
schneider
against
smith.
now,
question
number
one
the
question
relating
to
membership
in
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
has
defects
that
i
think
were
recognized
in
some
of
the
questions
here
and
that
judge
friendly
pointed
out,
they
omit
the
absence
of
knowledge
concerning
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
they
omit
the
absence
of
congruence
that
is
membership
at
the
same
time
that
the
organization
had
these
purposes.
in
addition
to
the
two
points
made
by
judge
friendly,
which
resulted
in
new
york
changing
its
question
to
import,
to
include
these
two
elements.
we
suggest
that
the
elements
involved
in
brandenburg
against
ohio
was
suggested
by
that
namely
a
specific
intent
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
organization
with
which
one
and
which
one
is
a
member
are
elements
that
also
should
be
called
for
in
a
question
of
this
kind.
and
our
concern
of
course
is
the
fact
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
question
of
the
communist
party
was
not
involved
in
the
new
york
questionnaire
specifically.
and
as
i
say,
this
court
had
made
its
decision
which
we
would
hope
it
would
reconsider
on
communist
party.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
does
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
i
am
also
suggesting
one
more
thing
your
honor
with
respect
to
communist
party
questions
which
of
course
is
not
the
question
put
here,
it's
a
communist
party
question
is
a
much
more
pointed
question
i'm
suggesting
that
your
honors'
decision
mr.
justice
harlan
in
opinion
and
barenblatt
and
the
opinion
in
gibson
and
perhaps
the
sound
reasons
because
we
are
in
the
first
amendment
area
now,
would
indicate
that
perhaps
even
assuming
that
the
communist
party
membership
question
can
ever
be
put
and
this
in
the
court
we're
willing
to
reconsider
whether
it
should
be
put.
that
kind
of
a
question
should
not
be
put
in
the
absence
of
a
foundation,
some
reason
to
believe
that
there's
of
course
can
make
that
particularly
inquiry
of
an
individual.
of
course,
your
honor
stated
that
view
in
reference,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
draft
of
that
inquiry
in
barenblatt
in
a
different
context.
but
we're
suggesting
that
the
deterrent
affect
upon
association
here
is
one
which
would
require
that
if
even
that
question
could
be
put
it
should
be
put
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
must
admit
that
i
think
that
my
case
could
won
very
easily
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
because
i
think
that
the
public
problem
is
quite
important
and
i
know
that
this
court
could
say
not
only
with
the
case
that
i'm
bringing
here
but
with
the
general
impact
upon
membership
at
the
bar.
and
my
concern
is
that
the
large
amount
of
activities
which
the
court
knows
young
law
students
are
engaging
in
today
activities
in
the
south,
activities
with
the
poor,
activities
with
minority
groups,
a
panoply
of
activities
are
going
to
be
discouraged
and
undiscouraged
if
questions
this
kind
are
submitted
to
be
put.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
really
do
think
so,
your
honor.
when
i
argued
this
matter
before
the
statutory
court
these
judge
bonsal
raised
a
question.
he
sounded
skeptical
also
but
i
may
say
that
if
your
honor
will
see
the
array
of
the
opinion
in
lscrrc.
the
court
eventually
recognize
that
what
i
have
said
what
the
reality
thought
was
we
who
stand
here
you
who
stand
there
are
not
as
close
to
these
young
law
students
who
are
engaged
in
worked
in
vengeance
and
even
i
who
have
been
involved
with
so
many
of
these
cases
in
the
last
decade
are
now
regarded
as
old
had
as
conservatives.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
i
think
one
of
the
--
because
your
honor
the
distinction
is
the
people
who
worked
among
the
poor
or
who
works
among
minority
groups
are
also
in
fighting
against
authority
i'm
using
the
word
fighting
at
a
general
sense.
they
are
regarded
as
dissidents,
they
regarded
as
radicals
and
if
i
can
suggest
your
honor
well
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
here,
your
honor
will
notice
in
our
briefs
what
happened
when
mr.
stolar
appeared
before
the
committee
and
what
the
committee
said
to
him.
they're
not
after
having
gone
through
this
and
the
applicant's
waiting
to
answer
these
generalized
question
of
the
fact
of
nature,
your
honors
will
see
on
page
six
of
my
brief
that
the
committee
pressed
him
into
specific
questions
and
answers
and
that
eventually
he
answered
that
he
had
--
and
these
are
the
words
from
the
committee
“that
he
is
not
now
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
socialist
party
or
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
that
he
has
signed
the
standards
of
the
united
states
preinduction
army
oath
with
respect
to
a
list
of
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.”
in
other
words,
the
people
who
are
engaged
in
work
generally
and
who
are
members
of
the
student
organization
after
another
are
met
by
this
kind
of
specific
inquiry
under
ohio's
program
and
what
reason
is
there
that
they
should
be
asked,
that
a
student
should
be
asked
whether
he
is
a
member
of
any
socialist
party.
all
of
these
arises
as
i
say
in
the
context
of
ohio's
program
and
all
of
these
is
bound
to
discourage
young
men
from
joining
organizations,
from
joining
student
groups
and
what
we
are
doing
ultimately
is
we
are
letting
the
decisions
to
be
made
in
these
things
as
they
must
be
made
i
suppose
by
character
committees
who
makes
for
into
first
amendment
protected
activities
here
and
who
live
in
a
milieu
which
is
so
different
from
the
young
men
who
are
in
the
law
schools
today
and
i
have
talked
that
recently
in
the
law
schools
i
have
been
amazed
in
the
different
quality
of
the
laws
students
that
exist
today
than
those
who
existed
even
10
years
ago.
and
these
students
should
not
be
discouraged
by
questions
that
are
of
this
kind
and
that
are
put
by
ohio
as
to
whether
they
are
members
of
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
assuming
there
is
such
a
single
organization
today.
they
should
not
be
discouraged
by
asking
whether
they
are
members
of
a
socialist
party.
all
of
these
arises
and
arises
in
the
context,
your
honors
will
know,
that
nobody
has
made
any
determination
such
as
the
court
suggested
in
a
different
context
that
i
think
applicable
here
in
joint
anti-fascist
against
mcgrath,
a
determination
that
an
organization
is
an
organization
which
one
should
not
belong
to.
it
gives
a
freewheeling
suite
to
the
committees
to
make
this
inquiry.
now,
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
although
i
have
suggested
that
ought
to
be,
should
be
reconsidered
by
the
court,
the
court
has
pointed
out
repeatedly
legislative
findings,
legislative
hearings,
judicial
hearings
and
so
forth.
but
with
respect
to
matters
other
than
the
communist
party,
then
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
somebody
must
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
an
organization
is
on
a
particular,
should
be
on
a
list.
if
list
had
to
be
permitted
before
we
are
to
give
committee
the
right
to
ask
questions
concerning
that.
and
of
course,
when
we
ask
questions
concerning
any
organization
you're
even
going
beyond
what
the
court
did
at
schneider
against
smith
when
they
talked
about
250
organizations
and
are
referred
to
the
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
of
mr.
justice
fortes
and
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
know,
perhaps
the
ohio
can
say.
as
far
as
we
know
that
these
are
the
forms
used
and
i
suspect
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
by
the
states,
i
suspect
used
by
the
character
committees
in
many
states
in
the
last
15
to
20
years
not
before,
this
is
something
new.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
seek
review
here
from
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
denying
the
opportunity
to
the
petitioner
to
take
the
ohio
bar
examinations
because
he
refused
on
grounds
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
association
and
belief
and
the
--
his
constitutional
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
against
self-incrimination
both
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
to
refuse
to
answer
three
questions
which
appear
upon
page
5
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
first
question
was
“state
whether
you
have
been
or
presently
are
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force.
if
your
answer
to
any
section
of
the
above
question
is
yes,
set
forth
the
facts
in
detail.”
the
second
question
is
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
clubs,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member.”
and
the
third
question
on
a
different
questionnaire
was
“list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
clubs,
societies
or
organizations
of
which
you
are
or
have
been
a
member
since
registering
as
a
law
student.”
the
petitioner
answered
the
entire
series
of
questions
on
these
questionnaires.
he
had
been
shortly
prior
thereto
been
admitted
to
the
new
york
bar
was
seeking
admission
to
the
ohio
bar,
he
being
employed
in
ohio
in
a
community
legal
service
organization
under
the
auspices
of
the
ohio.
and
he
declined
originally
to
answer
these
questions
in
writing,
stating
his
fifth
amendment
objection.
when
he
had
an
interview
with
the
two
members
of
the
subcommittee
of
the
character
committee,
they
--
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
relying
either
then
or
shortly
thereafter
by
letter
upon
his
first
amendment
right
of
association
and
upon
being
pressed
however
in
the
oral
examination
that
occurs
with
one
young
man
against
two,
not
very
many,
much
older
members
of
the
character
committee.
he
answered
as
appears
on
page
6
all
specific
questions,
the
committee
appears
to
have
put
to
him,
namely
that
he
is
not
now
and
has
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
socialist
party
or
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
that
he
has
signed
the
standard
u.s.
army
preinduction
security
oath
which
has
reference
to
the
attorney
general’s
list,
same
list
that
was
involved
in
schneider
against
smith.
the
committee
as
their
reports
which
are
in
the
record
he
indicate
were
very
much
impressed
with
his
sincerity,
his
ability,
his
forthrightness,
his
reliance
on
principle
and
one
of
them
indeed
said
that
but
for
the
failure
to
answer
on
the
record
made,
he
would
recommend
the
admission
of
the
petitioner
provided
that
his
colleagues
would
do
so.
but
his
colleagues
refused
to
do
so
stating
that
because
the
questions
have
been
asked
and
they
regarded
the
konigsberg
case
as
an
authority
for
these
more
general
questions,
they
would
not
recommend
his
admission
to
the
bar.
the
matter
went
to
the
character
committee
as
a
whole.
the
chairman
wrote
to
the
petitioner.
he
again
declined
to
answer
and
when
the
matter
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
he
then
retained
counsel,
his
present
counsel,
who
wrote
to
the
court,
pointing
out
that
even
under
the
decision
of
the
judge
friendly’s
court
in
the
case
next
before
your
honors
which
had
just
condemned
each
of
these
three
questions
violated
the
rule
of
precision
and
while
counsel
took
issue
with
judge
friendly’s
decision
feeling
that
it
had
not
gone
far
enough
as
mr.
dawson
will
indicate
in
the
next
case,
it
seemed
rather
clear
that
under
judge
friendly’s
decision,
these
questions
were
improper.
the
court
nevertheless
being
obviously
being
to
the
contrary
view,
denied
petitioner’s
admission
to
the
ohio
bar
and
this
lawsuit
resulted.
now,
we
make
three
points.
the
first
is
the
precision
argument,
an
argument
well-supported
by
the
cases
to
which
i
will
develop
unlike
my
last
argument
here
most
of
my
time,
so
that
it
could
be
presented
clearly
to
the
court
because
it
involves
this
very
case.
the
second
is
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
argument
which
has
been
adverted
to
by
mr.
baird
and
i
will
simply
add
several
distinctions
in
terms
of
points
that
could
be
made
between
this
and
spivak.
and
the
third
is
the
argument
that
there
is
no
substantial
state
interest
either
in
the
general
inquiry
with
respect
to
advocacy
and
with
respect
to
membership
and
organizations
with
political
advocacy
regardless
of
what
it
is,
that
the
first
amendment
is
also
a
bar
to
such
questions
and
more
specifically
that
in
this
particular
case,
given
this
record,
no
substantial
interest
has
been
shown
to
justify
the
inquiry
of
the
state.
now
very
briefly,
when
i
went
into
a
long
line
in
my
last
argument
here,
let
me
state
that
these
political
--
these
questions
with
respect
to
political
advocacy
and
political
association,
our
claim
to
have
some
relationship
to
the
question
of
moral
fitness
for
admission
to
the
practice
of
the
law
and
we
agree
of
course
that
the
moral
fitness
is
as
important
of
consideration
as
technical
ability.
but
the
moral
fitness
that
we
think
this
is
relevant
to
is
that
stated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
schwer
where
he
said,
that
from
a
profession
charged
with
responsibilities,
there
must
be
exact
of
those
qualities
of
true
speaking,
of
a
high
sense
of
honor,
of
granted
discretion,
of
the
strictest
observance
of
fiduciary
responsibility
that
that
have
throughout
the
century
been
compendiously
described
as
moral
character.
and
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
konigsberg,
it
is
an
absence
of
conduct
constituting
moral
turpitude.
we
think
and
we
shall
leave
it
really
at
this
point
that
if
one
examines
the
questions
of
this
nature
that
had
been
put
to
the
members
of
the
bar
in
the
1920’s,
the
period
in
which
mr.
chief
justice
hughes,
later
chief
justice
hughes
defended
the
right
of
the
socialist
lawyers
to
be
members
of
new
york
state
legislature,
or
1950’s,
so-called
cold
war
period
or
late
1940’s.
we
see
that
this
question
which
is
directed
to
lawyers
in
a
number
of
states,
is
a
question
that
actually
was
directed
to
every
conceivable
occupation
from
the
piano
tunist
in
the
district
of
columbia
discussed
by
professor
galvan
in
the
book
we
have
cited
to
teachers,
people
in
the
merchant
marine
and
to
the
private
sectors
of
the
motion
pictures,
television,
radio
and
that
the
objective
was
always
the
same
objective.
a
general
fear
in
1920
and
1921
of
the
russian
revolution,
a
fear
in
1947
and
1948
of
an
international
communist
movement
threatening
the
foundation
of
the
society
as
the
court
indicated
in
konigsberg
and
was
not
really
based
upon
any
concern
that
even
communist
lawyers
were
a
threat
to
the
bar.
and
as
i
indicated
in
my
last
argument,
really
when
one
looks
at
the
record
of
those
who
we
think,
so
all
we
can
say
here
were
communist
lawyers,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
clinical
affiliation
or
advocacy
even
in
that
organization
pinpointed
by
konigsberg
presented
a
threat
to
orderly
judicial
processes.
but
again,
while
i
think
that
the
important
principle
is
one
that
ought
to
establish
in
this
case.
i
think
we
can
turn
to
our
case
which
does
not
involve
the
question
of
communist
party
membership
but
involves
the
principle
of
the
rule
of
precision
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
repeated
cases,
some
before
konigsberg,
i
think,
naacp
against
alabama
was
one
of
those
and
many
of
those
after
konigsberg
such
as
the
schneider
and
the
baggett
against
bullitt
and
a
lot.
and
in
those
cases,
the
general
principle
is
that
where
freedom
of
association
or
privacy
may
be
involved,
the
state
even
where
it
has
a
substantial
interest,
that
state
must
use
methods
which
will
minimize
the
effect
upon
freedom
of
association.
and
the
question
is,
has
that
happen
in
the
present
case
with
these
questions,
not
the
konigsberg
question
and
not
anything
else.
now,
we
suggest
your
honors,
that
it
does
not
and
that
this
case
is
clearly
is
clearly
governed
by
schneider
against
smith
and
by
shelton
against
tucker
and
that
all
three
questions
constitute
the
unlimited
indiscriminate
search
referred
to
in
shelton
against
tucker
because
they
call
for
in
one
case
all
organizations
within
a
certain
category
without
naming
them,
leaving
them
to
the
individual
to
figure
out
which
they
are
and
all
club
societies
and
organizations
(audio
cut).
the
court
apparently
in
killion
did
not
feel
any
such
difficulty
and
of
course,
you
also
had
in
konigsberg
as
i
will
evoke
to
later
on
a
specific
finding
made
by
all
three
branches
of
government
as
the
majority
opinion
said
in
361,
with
366
as
second
case,
findings
of
fact
supported
by
this
court’s
decision.
now,
judge
friendly
in
the
new
york
case
found
two
objections
to
question
12
(g).
the
first
question
was
that
it
lacked
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
applicant
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
organization
and
the
second
was
that
it
lacked
contemporaneity.
that
is
concurrence
of
knowledge
with
the
unlawful
advocacy
of
the
organization.
and
so
on,
that
principle,
these
cases
would
be
--
these
questions
would
be
invalid,
that
is
question
12
(g).
in
addition,
we
have
urged
and
this
will
be
developed
further
by
professor
dawson
when
he
argue
the
next
case
because
he’s
directing
his
focus
--
directing
his
focus
on
the
new
york
questions
that
the
elements
which
the
court
has
found
to
exist
as
taking
something
out
of
the
protected
area.
the
elements
based
upon
scales
in
brandenburg,
of
adherence
to
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
not
merely
knowledge,
a
specific
intent
to
advance
them,
the
quality
of
incitement
in
the
advocacy
and
possibly
even
as
brandenburg
held
and
that
was
a
criminal
case,
immanent
danger
to
the
community
that
those
elements
should
be
embodied
in
a
question
if
questions
at
all
are
to
be
asked.
now,
we
have
a
reason
why
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
judge
--
i
should
add,
judge
friendly
did
not
agree
with
those
standards.
he
did
not
believe
--
he
did
not
believe
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
the
brandenburg
test.
i
don’t
think
he
articulated
his
reasons
for
not
believing
it.
now,
we
have
reasons
why
we
think
that
even
all
of
those
elements
brandenburg,
konigsberg,
scales
added
to
these
questions
do
not
solve
the
problem
because
they
represent
a
restriction
upon
association
which
is
deleterious
and
which
is
not
necessary
to
advance
even
the
interest
of
the
state
if
they
regarded
as
substantial
here.
for
one
thing,
the
questions
that
are
put
whether
they
have
the
elements
or
not
require
the
applicant
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
organization
fits
into
one
political
category
as
or
another
and
as
the
court’s
opinions
in
noto
and
scales
and
dennis
have
indicated,
it
is
very
difficult
to
makes
such
a
judgment.
there’s
a
very
thin
line
sometimes
between
unlawful
advocacy
and
lawful
advocacy,
a
line
which
is
at
least
should
be
made
in
a
record
before
a
court,
a
jury
under
judicial
procedures
and
not
one
left
to
the
subjective
judgment
of
the
applicant
how
to
balance
by
the
subjective
judgment
of
his
interrogators.
maybe
young
or
old
members
of
character
committees
but
normally
taken
from
an
area
of
society
to
which
the
applicant
may
not
belong
and
to
risk
the
perjury
prosecution
from
speculation
here,
something
we
think
suggested
at
a
different
context
in
baggett
against
bullitt
where
you
had
vague
questions.
the
risks
of
that
in
this
area
is
something
--
is
a
reason
for
not
using
it
and
for
searching
for
a
different
method
of
interrogation.
we
think
also
the
consequences
of
asking
these
questions,
all
three
questions
that
was
put
last
time
when
i
argued
the
last
that
case
before
judge
bonsal
and
that
is
the
question
with
a
chilling
effect.
a
lawsuit,
not
everyone
but
many,
who
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
asked
these
questions
by
not
a
committee
of
his
peers
but
a
committee
of
older,
more
conservative
gentlemen
perfectly
respectable
areas
just
as
good
he
but
with
a
different
point
of
view,
may
very
well
be
afraid
to
join
organizations
as
a
law
student
or
as
a
college
student.
he
may
get
through
but
why
should
he
take
the
chance,
why
should
he
march
in
a
peace
parade
as
one
man
did
only
to
be
held
up
in
new
york
for
several
months
while
the
character
committee
speculated
on
why
he
marched
in
that
peace
parade.
and
so
a
young
man
will
have
a
tendency
to
say,
“let
me
be
careful,
let
me
clear
out
all
of
this.
if
i
want
to
join
anything,
i’ll
join
that
before
i
become
a
member
of
the
bar,
if
i
want
to
take
that
chance.”
the
second
is
that
we
have
to
think
of
the
independence
of
the
bar
which
is
much
more
than
a
phrase
all
of
us
and
both
sides
of
this
table.
we
want
a
bar
that
is
not
colored
politically
which
doesn’t
have
to
have
passed
a
political
test,
pass
a
test
of
conduct
but
not
a
political
test
of
associations,
of
beliefs,
of
advocacy.
and
finally,
we
have
a
problem
and
the
very
important
problem
of
the
impact
on
the
clients.
there
are
minority
groups.
there
are
black,
there
are
white.
there
are
dissident
groups,
there
are
radical
groups.
many
of
them
think,
sometimes
i
think
mistakenly
that
they
should
have
more
confidence
in
a
lawyer
who
thinks
generally
along
their
lines,
that
they
will
get
a
better,
a
better
assistance
from
such
a
lawyer.
as
i
say,
i’m
not
sure
they’re
right.
but
they
feel
that
way
and
the
question
is
whether
we
are
going
to
say
to
the
young
groups
of
dissident
groups,
minority
groups,
and
dissidents
have
the
wide
range,
we
are
going
to
screen
out
your
lawyers.
we
are
going
to
be
sure
that
the
lawyers
you
get
are
the
kind
that
we
think
ought
to
be
members
of
the
bar
and
those
who
may
very
well
be
more
sympathetic
to
your
purposes
are
the
lawyers
whom
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
have.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
broad
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
believe
that
the
question
concerning
belief,
your
honor,
is
sacrosanct.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
question
can
be
asked.
there
are
people,
there
are
judges
on
the
justices
on
this
court,
there
are
such
eminent
people
as
professor
emerson
who
believed
that
all
advocacy
is
a
form
of
protected
expression.
i
believe
that
too
but
whatever
may
be
the
dispute
with
respect
to
advocacy,
no
one
has
ever
suggested
whether
on
the
political
field
or
otherwise,
and
i
think
the
political
field
is
peculiarly
delicate
because
it
deals
with
doctrine.
it
tells
you
what
writings
you
have
read,
that
belief
must
be
absolutely
protected
from
inquiry.
now,
the
question
that
arises
now
your
honors
is
whether
given
the
picture
that
i
have
given
of
the
reasons
why
we
should
have
a
more
restricted
means
of
inquiry
granted
arguendo
a
substantial
state
interest
here,
isn’t
there
a
means
which
has
a
less
chilling
effect?
and
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
a
less
drastic
means,
to
use
the
term
used
innumerable
decisions
of
this
court,
would
permit
the
elimination
of
screening
of
this
kind
even
one
with
more
specific
and
would
have
a
number
of
other
tests.
a,
if
you
had
to
have
any
screening
at
all.
you
would
have
a
screening
in
which
would
say
that
only
be
with
respect
to
specific
organizations,
organizations
found
by
judicial
writ,
by
take
to
dennis
this
sacb
against
cp
cases
which
i
obviously
disagree
with
but
it’s
still
cases
in
which
the
due
process
aspect,
the
judicial
findings
of
fact
cannot
be
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
will
find
that
by
tomorrow
morning
but
i
subscribe
to
it
even
now.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
please
the
court.
i
indicated
yesterday
three
policy
considerations
why
i
thought
programs
of
this
kind,
requiring
an
advocacy
and
membership
and
advocating
the
organizations
were
not
dangerous,
were
not
the
less
restrictive
means
that
might
be
used.
i
would
add
one
fourth
item,
that
is
the
great
question
as
to
whether
there
really
is
predictability
in
determining
whether
people,
who
have
been
members
of
the
organizations
like
this
are
advocating,
will
turn
out
actually
after
becoming
members
of
the
bar
to
be
in
any
way
deleterious
or
delinquent
in
their
duties.
but
these
four
considerations,
which
i
have
mentioned,
have
led
me
to
two
conclusions
which
i
submit
to
the
court.
the
first
is
whether
assuming
there
should
be
any
screening
program
of
any
kind,
and
whether
there
shouldn’t
be
certain
safeguards
in
order
not
to
have
the
widespread,
wide
ranging
inquiry
and
i
suggest
two
safeguards
to
the
court,
if
we
are
to
continue
with
a
screening
program.
the
first
is
that
the
organization
concerning,
which
an
inquiry
is
made,
is
an
organization
which
has
been
found,
judicially
found,
as
in
konigsberg
to
be
a
organization
engaging
in
unlawful
activities.
this
is,
of
course,
in
wide
contrast
to
the
question
involved
in
this
case
where
the
questions
are
wide
ranging
and
vague.
and
the
second
consideration
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
there
should
be
some
foundation,
some
reason
to
believe
before
this
kind
of
inquiry
is
made
that
the
individual
involved
has
adhered
to
participate
in
the
unlawful
activities
of
such
an
organization.
but,
of
course,
our
principal
point
having
suggested
this
middle
ground,
a
ground
that
we
do
not
--
that
we
prefer
not
to
have
as
against
the
next
one,
is
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
any
screening
program
at
all.
we
suggest
that
in
the
case
of
lawyers,
their
peculiar
susceptibility
to
the
controls
of
the
courts
makes
the
alternative
the
least
less
respective
being
preferable
to
the
question
of
a
screening
program
with
the
dangers
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh
yes,
of
course.
i
meant
the
questions
of
the
kind
with
which
we
are
dealing
here.
i
don’t
need
bar
examinations
to
be
excluded
obviously.
and
the
fourth
point,
your
honors,
which
i
am
suggesting
as
available
as
very
strong,
but
less
restrictive
in
this
sense,
an
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights
are
these.
the
lawyer
himself
is
subject
as
an
officer
of
the
court
as
well
as
his
clients
to
the
contempt
power
of
the
judges
for
whatever
that
he
may
do
in
the
court
room
or
with
respect
to
the
cases.
the
lawyer
alone
is
subject
to
the
very
powerful
disciplinary
proceedings
ending
in
the
dreaded
disbarment
which
is
ruinous.
the
lawyer
in
special
cases
is
subject
to,
of
course,
a
malpractice
suit
by
his
client
and
finally,
as
we
approach
the
area
of
criminal
activities
with
which
we
are
most
concerned,
the
lawyer
is,
of
course,
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
this
would
be
my
general
observation,
unrelated
necessarily
to
the
peculiar
facts
in
our
case.
but
in
our
case,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
think
there
is
neither
obstruction
of
the
process
of
a
kind
that
was
found
by
the
court
to
exist
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo,
nor
a
substantial
state
interest
requiring
this
petitioner
to
answer
these
questions.
and
i
submit
that
because
as
i
indicated
to
your
honors
in
my
original
presentation,
all
of
the
specific
questions
that
were
put
to
the
petitioner,
including
those
that
were
involved
in
konigsberg
and
anastaplo
were
answered
by
him
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
committee's
report
that
he
would
not
have
answered
any
other
specific
questions.
it
was
the
general
ones
to
which
he
took
exception.
and
he
took
exception
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
as
a
matter
of
basic
principle
because
the
committee
had
before
it
his
answers
to
many
of
these
questions,
only
slightly
different
worded,
that
he
had
made
in
the
new
york
bar
examinations.
obviously,
the
change
in
position
with
due
to
the
notoriety
that
was
given
to
our
then
pending
wistrik
(ph)
case
which
professor
dawson
will
argue.
so
the
second
point
with
respect
to
substantial
state
interest,
whatever
maybe
the
theoretical
interest
of
a
state,
is
it
not
significant
that
in
this
case
no
explanation
of
a
kind
that
was
given
in
konigsberg
by
the
state
based
on
a
statute
or
in
anastaplo
based
upon
a
rule
of
the
court,
namely
the
concern
about
the
nature
of
the
organization
is
offered
in
the
state's
brief.
the
state's
brief
gives
a
completely
different
theory,
a
wide
ranging
theory
as
to
why
these
questions
are
asked.
and
it
says
three
things;
we
wanted
to
know;
two,
what
organization’s
he
was
a
member
of,
so
we
can
ask
the
other
members
of
the
organization
whether
they
might
not
have
some
information
derogatory
to
the
plaintiff.
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a
census,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
that
would
have
been
to
say
to
the
petitioner
name
every
single
person
you
have
ever
heard
of,
you
ever
knew
in
your
life.
i
submit
that,
that
is
not,
on
our
own
brief,
a
substantial
interest
of
the
state
in
this
case.
now
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
the
second
point,
the
point
has
been
made
by
mr.
baird.
i
will
not
repeat
what
he
said,
except
to
add
two
things
that
he
did
not
mention.
the
first
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
area
of
political
inquiry,
whatever
it
may
be
called,
and
we
have
to
remember
that
in
the
question
of,
this
questions
of
this
kind,
bearing
in
mind
the
historic
origins
of
the
privilege
which
i
certainly
should
not
teach
the
court
that
it
rested
in
religious
and
political
persecutions.
that
this
is
a
peculiarly
good
case,
appropriate
case
whatever
they'd
be
in
other
situations
for
the
association
of
the
privilege.
and
the
second
is
a
point
which
was
made,
as
i
indicated
yesterday
at
baggett
against
bullitt
that
where
questions
are
vague,
they
present
an
appropriate
reason
for
saving
the
privilege
because
of
a
danger
of
a
perjury
prosecution.
even
though
generally
speaking,
obviously,
the
refusal
to
answer
a
specific
on
the
ground
that
it
might
invite
a
perjury
prosecution
is
not
a
proper
defense.
and
i
last
on
this
point
might
refer
to
in
addition
to
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
i
failed
to
mention
in
my
brief
which
is
at
240,
f2nd,
401
in
which
the
chief
justice
participated
as
a
member
of
a
per
curium
court
that
dealt
with
this
problem
of
the
danger
of
perjury
prosecution
in
connection
with
a
vague
question.
it
was
a
contempt
of
congress
case,
your
honor
as
the
chief
justice
i
remember
involving
harvey
o'connor.
this
i
think,
your
honor,
is
subject
to
a
few
answers
is
my
submission.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
appease
the
court.
our
reply
brief
sets
forth
very
clearly
that
the
petitioner
raised
the
question
of
the
non-pertinentcy
of
the
questions,
which
is
clearly
in
the
first
amendment
area.
in
his
interview
with
the
committee
members
and
thereafter
before
he
ever
retained
counsel,
he
is
only
a
little
more
sophisticated
than
the
young
member
of
the
bar,
he
asserted
his
first
amendment
rights
in
a
communication
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee.
secondly,
the
committee
members
did
not
have
any
impression
from
his
having
made
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment,
which
in
itself
is
a
rather
ambiguous
term
these
days,
since
it
can
comprehend
any
aspect
to
process
self-incrimination
and
so
forth,
and
was
not
the
particularized
in
its
original
answer,
they
do
no
conclusion
with
respect
to
bad
character.
your
honors
will
recall
my
reference
to
mr.
snodgrass,
one
of
the
two
committee
members
who
affirmatively
found
good
character
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
and
the
only
concern
was
whether
or
not
konigsberg
required
that,
because
the
question
was
put,
it
had
to
be
answered,
not
without
reaching
out
to
the
nature
of
the
question.
it's
almost
a
case
of
(inaudible)
state.
we
put
the
question,
konigsberg
might
tell
us,
we
have
right
to
ask
questions,
you
have
got
to
answer
this
or
you
are
obstructing.
now
the
reference
to
political
activities
referred
to
in
my
brief
even
involving
crime,
is
a
reference
to
the
language
in
the
decisions
in
which
i
won't
take
time
to
mention
here
--
quote
to
your
your
honor.
in
cummings
against
missouri,
an
ex
parte
garland
and
the
discussion
of
those
cases
indent
against
west
virginia,
which
analyzed
those
cases.
and
those
happened
to
be
cases
unlike
the
present
situations
involving
activities.
here
we
are
not
dealing
with
activities,
but
we
are
dealing
with
advocacy.
now
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
problem,
it
was
touched
upon
by
friend
here.
it
was
mentioned
yesterday
by
the
attorney
of
arizona,
with
respect
to
what
all
of
us
know,
questions
of
lawyer's
behavior
before
courts
is
not
a
question
of
the
kind
to
which
these
questions,
these
1920,
these
1950
questions
were
directed.
they
were
concerned
about
the
whole
question
of
doctrine
not
about
the
behavior
of
lawyers
in
a
particular
case
and
it
is
a
bootstrap
argument
to
try
to
connect
these
two
things
which
are
not
connected
in
the
minds
of
the
lawgivers.
those
people
who
wrote
these
questions
originally
did
not
face
the
problems
which
all
of
us
know
exist
today.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
bar
examining
committee
presumably
with
the
approval
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
but
it
is
not
a
legislative
inquiry.
now
we
are
all
concerned
about
the
role
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sorry,
i
didn't
check.
i
don't
know
about
ohio,
your
honor.
i
know
that
the
pattern
was
a
1950
pattern
with
some
historical
background
in
1920s,
perhaps
ohio
can
tell
you
honor
on
that
after
checking
it.
thank
you.
