justice

can
i
ask
you
whether
this

covers
all
the
property

covered
by

and
i
suppose
the
section

is
triggered
only
when
the
indian
owns
restricted
property
that
is
the
property
which
united
states
is
holding
entrust
for
him.
justice

stewart
if
he
doesn't
own
any
of
that
property
but
owns
a
lot
of
other
property
then
the
secretary
has
no
power?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
answer
to

how
about
mr.

white's
question?
what
if
they
--
if
an
indians
owns
an
addition
to
allotted

what
if
he
owns
realty
or
personally
of
his

does
the
secretary
have
any
right
to
disapprove
any
will
with
respect
to
that
property?
justice

stewart
so,
if
he
owns
both
kinds
of

--
justice

stewart
allotted?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
rules

regulations

statements
of
administrative
policy
with
respect
to
classes
of
beneficiaries
who
will
be
disapproved
or
who
must
be
included
or
anything
like
that?
in
other
words,
can
an
indian
will
this
property
to
a
white
man
or
a
whiskey
dealer
or
somebody
to
whom
he
owes?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
such
administrative
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
thing
at
all
these
wills
had
in
common
was
that
they
showed
a
very
clear
intention
not
to
make
dorita
high
horse
the
object
to
his
bounty.
is
that
correct?
justice

stewart
and
if
he
died

tested,
i
suppose
she
would've
been
sole
heir.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
so,
probably
no
one
conceive
the
sole
purpose
of
making
a
will
was
to
see
to
it
that
she
did
not
inherit
his

is
that
