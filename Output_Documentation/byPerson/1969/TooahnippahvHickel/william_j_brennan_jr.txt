justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
luellen
really
your
whole
argument
and
the
only
issue
for
us
to
decide
as
i
understand
it
of
the
briefs
is
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
whether
judicial
review
of
that
action
is
precluded
by
the
statutes,
that's
all,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
you
haven't
really
got
to
that
issue
which
as
i
understood
is
the
only
issue
we
have
in
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
really
nothing
to
do
with
--
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
background
of
the
wills
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it's
not
but
that's
the
only
issue
for
us
to
decide,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
suggestion
made
that
the
secretary
should
fix
up
a
legacy
sort
of
comparative
rule
of
beneficiaries
fixing
up
the
legacy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suggestion
for
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
because
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
in
the
secretary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stone,
it
seems
to
me
--
am
i
right
about
this
what
you've
been
saying
about
equitable
consideration,
it's
not
that
broad
isn't
it?
i
gather
what
you
were
saying
is
that.
but
the
secretary
decides
if
someone
who
should
have
been
the
object
of
his
bounty
was
excluded
by
the
will
and
the
secretary
thinks
that
was
unfair
to
exclude
that
person.
then
the
secretary
may
disapprove
the
will,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
put
this
for
these
words
equitable
considerations.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
i
gather
what
you've
been
saying
is
that
really
it
comes
down
to
whether
he
unfairly
excluded
someone
who
should've
had
some
provision
(voice
overlap)
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
here
what
you
have
here
is
everyone
involved
is
within
the
family,
either
nieces
or
his
natural
daughter,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
place
in
consideration
here
was
that
he
should
not
have
excluded
from
his
will
--
his
natural
daughter
and
the
distribution
or
the
divides
rather
these
allotted
lands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
what
the
whole
thing
turned
out.
the
secretary
just
thought
it
wasn't
fair
not
to
have
made
provision
for
a
share
at
least
in
both
lands
in
the
daughter,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
stone,
is
there
any
question
of
this
petitioners
being
nieces
and
nephews?
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
would
they
be
executed
the
class
of
allottee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
allottee
here
would
be
the
deceased
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ant
that
this,
well,
the
purposes
of
the
allotment
act
would
be
his
nieces
and
nephews
whatever
they
are
be
included
that
the
class?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
in
his
allotment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
your,
is
the
government's
point
that
they
have
to
lose
because
congress
never
intended
that
any
except
his
immediate
family
should
be
the
beneficiary
of
these
allotments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
an
answer
to
me
that
i
think
might
have
approved
his
will
even
though
all
of
the
allotted
land
went
to
nieces
and
nephews
rather
than
the
