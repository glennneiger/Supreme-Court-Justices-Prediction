justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
regardless
of
whether
he's
on
the
reservation
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
i'd
be
correct
in
saying
that
chief
judge
--
former
chief
judge
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
judge
barefoot
couldn't
make
a
will,
because
he
was
full-blooded
choctaw
indian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
have
to
be
approved
by
the
secretary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
still
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
secretary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case
are
indians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
when
you
keep
emphasizing
the
fact
that
congress
meant
for
this
to
stay
with
the
indians
that's
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
second?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
that
legislative
history
that
said
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
have
the
right
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
the
testator
distributed
it
fairly
among
his
heirs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
providing
they
all
are
indians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
there
in
this
case
to
say
these
people
ought
not
to
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
not
best
equitable
argument
(voice
overlap)
that
ms.
high
horse
you
have
a
part
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
from
a
technical
standpoint,
could
he
have
let
the
fifth
will
stand
or
the
fourth
or
the
third?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
government
lawyer
who
drew
this
will
wasn't
he
required
to
find
out
whether
the
man
was
capable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
raise
the
question
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
drew
six
wills?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
talked
to
them
at
least
six
times
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
would
be
a
government
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they're
all
government
lawyers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
represent
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
government
had
the
responsibility
of
finding
out
whether
this
man
was
apparently

capable?
justice
thurgood
