mr.
richard
b.
stone
now,
the
government's
position
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
this
is
an
unreviewable
power
under
section
2
of
the
1910
act.
of
course,
we
are
basically
putting
forth
two
contentions
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
secretary's
determinations
are
in
fact
non-reviewable.
the
other
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
limited
standard
of
review
which
is
to
review
whether
the
secretary
has
exceeded
the
scope
of
his
authority
in
rendering
his
discretionary
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
question
was
not
reached
by
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
think
that
is
a
possible
disposition
of
the
case
and
it
would
understandable
if
the
court
chose
to
decide
this
way.
i
think
the
question
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
court
could
--
that
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
secretary
has
the
right
to
apply
equitable
considerations
to
the
case
that
this
court
could
reach
that
decision
quite
easily
and
remand
if
necessary
with
instructions
to
apply
that
rule.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
given
some
standard
of
review
and
i
think
that
the
standard
that
they
should
be
given
is
a
very
broad
one
that
the
secretary
has
extremely
wide
powers
in
this
area,
and
that
a
reversal
would
only
be
in
order
if
the
secretary
had
grossly
abused
his
scope
of
discretion.
i
would
like,
with
the
court's
permission,
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
historical
context
in
which
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
act
of
1910
appears
because
i
think
it
bears
--
this
historical
context
bears
very
heavily
on
both
of
them
contentions
that
the
government
is
making
in
this
case.
the
contention
that
the
secretary
is
given
absolute
discretion,
non-reviewable
and
the
contention
that
the
congress
intended
for
him
to
exercise
a
very
wide
range
of
considerations
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
will.
the
general
allotment
act
is
--
was
one
of
the
major
aspects
of
congress'
effort
to
make
reservation
indians
economically
integrated
and
self-sufficient
members
of
the
society.
under
the
allotment
system
prior
to
1934,
the
government
divided
and
allotted
reservation
properties
that
convey
them
to
individual
indians
and
their
families.
the
properties
were
conveyed
under
an
arrangement
which
this
court
has
characterized
not
as
a
technical
trust
arrangement
but
as
a
kind
of
special
guardianship
by
which
the
department
of
the
interior
is
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
restricting
alienation
of
the
indian's
interest
in
these
lands
and
furtherance
of
a
congressional
policy
which
this
court
has
described
as
“the
promotion
of
prudence
to
afford
protection
to
dependent
and
natural
heirs”
and
also
“preserving
restricted
land
for
the
indians.”
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
legal
relationship
is
a
very
special
one
between
the
government
and
reservation
indian
tribes
in
communities
and
that
special
relationship
has
survived
the
break-up
of
certain
reservations
and
the
allotment
to
individual
indians
of
tribal
lands
at
least
that
has
survived
with
respect
to
the
allotted
land
themselves
and
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
government
continues
to
guard
against
the
improvident
alienation
of
these
properties
by
the
indian
allottees.
it
was
congress'
hope
at
the
time
when
the
regional
allotment
act
was
passed
that
the
government's
guardianship
and
the
time
at
which
--
from
the
time
of
which
it
would
be
deemed
advisable
to
remove
restrictions
would
be
only
about
25
years.
it
was
hoped
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
his
lands
could
be
conveyed
to
the
indians
in
fee
simple.
in
the
majority
of
instances
however,
removal
of
the
restrictions
on
alienation
soon
resulted
in
the
acquisition
of
these
properties
by
parties
unrelated
to
the
indian
allottees
usually
in
fact
by
non-indians.
in
furtherance
of
the
statutory
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
which
was
to
preserve
the
value
of
the
allotted
properties
for
the
benefit
of
the
allotted
indians
and
their
families
in
most
cases
the
period
of
guardianship
has
been
extended.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i'm
about
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
that
a
reminder
of
the
historical
background
and
particularly
the
historical
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
which
was
to
ensure
that
these
conveyed
indian
lands
remain
for
the
benefit
of
indians
and
the
indian
allottees
and
their
families
is
rather
helpful
to
an
understanding
of
the
statutory
context.
it's
rather
helpful
to
an
understanding
of
range
of
the
secretary's
powers
in
approving
or
disapproving
alienation
of
indian
wills.
the
secretary
statutory
duty
to
preserve
these
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
allottee
during
his
lifetime
is
supplemented
by
a
duty
to
supervise
the
disposition
of
allotted
properties
upon
the
death
of
the
allottee
pursuant
to
the
act
of
june
25,
1910
which
is
the
act
under
consideration
of
this
case.
and
sections
1
and
2
of
this
act
taken
together
provide
a
complete
enumeration
of
the
secretary's
powers
over
the
disposition
of
allotted
properties
at
the
death
of
the
allottee.
section
1
as
you
know
authorizes
the
secretary
to
determine
the
legal
heirs
of
the
deceased
and
this
determination
or
statute
is
to
be
made
under
state
law
in
this
case,
the
law
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
section
1,
as
this
court
has
dealt
is
aware
provides
that
the
secretary's
determination
of
heirship
is
to
be
final
and
conclusive
and
requires
only
that
the
secretary
hold
a
hearing
with
notice.
this
court
has
explicitly
held
that
the
secretary's
determinations
of
heirs
are
not
reviewable
by
any
court.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
specifically
held
that
section
1
determinations
are
not
reviewable
even
if
errors
of
law
are
alleged.
this
is
the
first
moon
v.
white
tail
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
270
u.s.
243.
the
court
recognized
in
the
first
moon
case,
the
secretary's
unique
and
pervasive
role
with
respect
to
these
restricted
properties
and
found
that
“abundant
reason
for
the
provision
precluding
review
become
apparent
upon
considerations
of
the
infinite
difficulties
which
otherwise
would
arise
in
connection
with
the
sundry
duties
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
relative
to
indian
allotments.”
now
section
2
of
the
act
of
1910
which
is
of
course
the
key
provision
under
consideration
in
this
case
requires
the
secretary
in
a
case
in
which
the
deceased
indian
hast
left
a
will
to
approve
or
disapprove
that
will.
if
the
will
is
disapproved,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
the
property
passes
and
its
entirety
by
the
laws
of
intestacy,
that
is
the
restricted
property
(inaudible)
in
the
will.
a
determination
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
the
secretary
as
far
as
i'm
awareness
no
right
to
disapprove
any
disposition
of
that
other
property
at
all.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
restrictions
run
only
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
both
inter
vivos
and
testamentary
restrictions
run
only
to
the
restricted
property
and
of
course
tied
in
to
the
conveyance
of
the
restricted
property
at
the
time
the
allotment
is
made.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
believe
that
it
is
regardless
of
whether
he's
on
the
reservation
or
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
not
aware
of
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
make
a
will
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
only
with
respect
to
restricted
property
that
he
held
an
allotted
restricted
property.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
assume
the
secretary
in
the
case
of
such
a
testator
would
give
great
weight
to
the
testator's
will
and
would
assume
that
the
disposition
that
he
made
of
the
property
was
improvident.
and
i
assume
actually
that
by
this
time
such
a
person
would
have
been
granted
his
restricted
land
fee
simple
which
the
secretary
also
has
the
power
to
do.
but
if
by
some
chance,
he
still
held
land
under
a
subject
to
restrictions
then
the
secretary
would
continue
to
have
the
power
to
approve
the
power
to
approve
the
will
in
so
far
as
it
disposed
of
those
restricted
territories.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that
would
propose
a
very
naughty
question.
if
the
will
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
is
no
regulation
or
statutory
provision
prohibiting
him
from
willing
this
land
to
a
white
man,
but
the
purpose
of
the
--
and
the
mandate
given
to
the
secretary
by
the
allotment
act
by
the
act
of
1910
would
subject
the
secretary
to
very
close
scrutiny
if
he
were
to
or
would
cause
the
secretary
to
very
closely
scrutinized
any
will
which
gave
restricted
property
to
a
white
person.
i've
known
in
this
connection
that
there
was
in
one
time
that
at
the
moment
the
regulations
are
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
are
quite
general
and
don't
refer
to
what
specifically
what
types
of
considerations
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
approving
or
disapproving
the
will.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
there
was
at
one
time,
a
set
of
regulations
which
the
secretary
which
have
laid
out
in
the
numerate
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
that's
24
f.
2d,
i
don't
have
the
cite
for
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
there,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
regulations
are
very
silent
with
respect
both
to
the
factum
and
to
the
equitable
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account.
there
are
practically
no
technical
requirements
laid
down
at
the
regulation
at
all.
simply
that
that
testator
should
be
of
--
have
testimony
capacity
and
that
there
should
be
two
competent
witnesses.
unlike
the
section
1
determination
which
is
proscribed
according
to
state
law,
that
is
the
determination
of
heirship.
approval
of
the
will
is
subject
to
secretary's
own
standards
all
together.
there
are
no
technical
requirements
and
the
secretary
has
produced
very
few
technical
requirements.
the
regulations
in
short
like
the
statute
leave
the
secretary
and
his
delegates
with
maximum
flexibility
in
discretion
and
that
is
quite
in
harmony
with
the
entire
statutory
scheme
under
which
the
secretary
supervises
these
restricted
lands
both
during
the
lifetime
of
the
allottees
and
after
the
death
of
allottees.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
are
other
instances
in
which
the
secretary
has
applied
equitable
considerations.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
there
are
--
i've
only
been
able
to
find
cases
in
which
the
will
has
been
approved
though
it's
clear
that
equitable
considerations
were
taken
into
account.
now,
that
i
have
been
able
to
locate
a
decision
that
is
cited
in
the
decision
of
the
regional
solicitor,
it
appears
to
be
unreported.
i've
searched
for
it
in
the
interior
department
cases
and
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
the
regional
solicitor
cited
one
case
and
which
a
will
have
been
disapproved
on
equitable
grounds.
now,
that
case
was
not
reviewed
later
by
any
court.
it
wasn't
brought
to
any
court
and
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
burger,
i
believe
in
view
of
the
policy
of
the
general
--
of
the
allotment
act
to
preserve
indian
lands
--
restricted
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
allottees
and
their
families
and
dependents.
it
is
not
a
close
question
in
a
case
at
which
an
indian
has
totally
an
indian
allottee
has
totally
neglected
his
only
born
child
all
through
her
childhood
and
thereafter.
however,
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
know
whether
this
a
close
question
or
not
because
it
is
a
question
that
is
been
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
it
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes
and
that
is
--
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
secretary's
discretion
at
least
applies
to
determining
whether
a
property
has
been
allocated
under
the
purposes
and
consistently
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
i
note
in
this
regard
if
the
chief
justice
is
interested
in
the
closeness
of
the
question
from
an
equitable
point
of
view
that
the
regional
solicitor
didn't
find
to
close
at
all
the
beside
of
the
fact
that
the
testator
had
made
five
or
six
wills
and
he
changed
his
place
of
residence
around
in
number
of
times,
so
that
he
seem
to
feel
that
there
wasn't
that
much
weight
to
be
given
to
the
equitable
considerations
on
the
side
of
approving
the
testator's
will.
and
he
felt
quite
compelled
by
the
fact
that
this
man
had
never
in
his
entire
lifetime
done
anything
to
support
his
daughter
which
was
--
and
never
used
any
of
his
substantial
income
from
his
restricted
properties
in
furtherance
of
her
support.
and
the
regional
solicitor
government
felt
that
this
was
quite
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
under
these
conveyances.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
believe
that
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case
are
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
no,
i
divide
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
divide
that
point
up
into
two.
i
think
that
it
is
a
part
of
congress'
purposes
was
to
make
sure
that
these
lands
passed
on
to
indians
as
oppose
to
non-indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
the
other
point
which
i
think
was
really
more
central
and
it
was
born
out
by
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
the
congress
intended
for
the
specific
congress
was
looking
not
only
to
the
interest
of
indians
in
general
but
to
specific
allottees
and
their
immediate
families
are
dependents.
the
regional
allotment
act
allotted
land
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
a
family.
the
head
of
the
household
got
a
certain
amount
in
each
dependent
or
board
of
a
household
will
receive
a
smaller
amount
of
allotted
land
which
was
held
by
the
secretary
in
trust
for
that
individual.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they're
most
certainly
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
would
like
to
quote
now
from
the
congressional
record
which
is
laid
down
at
pages
11
and
12
of
our
brief
a
conversation
occurring
in
the
debate
on
the
floor
the
house
of
representatives
between
mr.
--
representative
cox
of
indiana
and
mr.
burke
who
is
the
--
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
indian
affairs
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
discussing
the
reasons
why
the
law
of
1910
was
passed
congressman
cox
asked
congressman
burke
what
the
purpose
of
section
2
was
from
two
points
of
views.
he
was
interested
first
of
all
in
knowing
why
indians
were
given
the
power
to
write
wills
with
respect
to
restricted
properties
which
they
never
had
before.
and
furthermore,
what
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
role
was
with
respect
to
approving
or
disapproving
those
wills.
and
the
mr.
burke
cited
the
primary
case
to
which
he
thought
that
section
2
was
directed,
which
is
the
case
and
which
an
indian
allottee
has
after-born
children
who
are
not
covered
in
the
original
allotment.
and
in
the
case
to
that
kind,
the
indian
would
frequently
wish
to
have
these
after-born
children
provided
for
and
one
way
to
provide
for
them
would
be
to
give
them
a
disproportionate
share
of
his
own
allotment
upon
his
death.
now,
as
chairman
burke
says
and
i'm
now
on
page
12
of
my
brief.
in
a
case
of
that
kind,
undoubtedly
the
interior
department
would
okay
it.
whereas
if
it
was
a
will-giving
his
estate
to
some
person
who
ought
not
to
have
it
then
they
would
disapprove
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
there
--
is
it
necessarily
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there's
no
provision
mr.
justice
marshall
for
giving
her
part
of
it.
the
only
power
that
the
secretary
has
is
to
approve
the
will
or
disapprove
the
will
and
he
must
take
into
account
which
of
those
produces
a
disposition
of
the
property
that
is
more
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
of
the
regional
allotment
act
to
preserve
his
land
in
the
fellow's
hands
and
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
to
give
some
considerations
at
least
to
the
testator's
will.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
from
a
technical
point
of
view,
i
believe
he
could
have
let
the
fifth
will
stand
if
it
will
still
an
existence
and
were
found
to
be
properly
executed,
he
could.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
and
counsel
for
correspond
dorita
high
horse,
mr.
hill
i
believe
is
better
acquainted
with
that.
however,
the
secretary
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
see
the
distinction
between
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
posed
that
narrowly
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
it's
better
posed
in
terms
of
whether
the
disposition
which
he
made
of
these
lands
is
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
which
was
to
keep
those
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
testator
and
his
family
or
more
generally
within
the
indian
community.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
there
is
certainly
a
distinction
but
necessarily
a
distinction
however
with
respect
to
that
and
i
think
the
laws
of
intestacy
bear
this
distinction
not
altogether
since
they
give
all
of
the
property
to
a
daughter
and
none
to
the
nieces
and
nephews.
there
is
a
distinction
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
secretary
made
the
decision
that
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
purpose
behind
the
allotment
for
this
girl
to
be
left
out
of
her
father's
will.
now,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge
it
doesn't
mr.
justice
white.
it's
possible
that
mr.
hill
may
be
better
acquainted
with
that.
i
didn't
pick
that
up
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
certainly
not
in
the
printed
record.
it
may
be
in
the
transcript
of
the
administrative
hearing
which
was
stipulated
out
of
the
printed
record.
i
don't
think
this
was
a
focus
of
the
hearing
examiner's
inquiries.
the
selection
from
the
congressional
record
which
i've
just
read
to
this
court
is
illuminating.
i
think
not
only
because
it
shows
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
broad
discretion
with
respect
to
whether
restricted
lands
ought
to
be
alienated
by
will
from
the
immediate
heirs
of
the
allotment
holders.
but
also
because
it
shows
that
the
purpose
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
gave
allottees
the
right
to
make
wills
was
not
to
abrogate
the
prior
policy
of
assuring
that
restricted
lands
remain
in
the
family
of
the
allottee,
but
rather
to
allow
the
allottee
in
certain
situations
greater
flexibility
in
providing
a
more
even
distribution
of
assets
to
his
own
heirs.
it
would
certainly
be
rather
startling
development
in
the
statutory
context
under
which
the
secretary
maintains
complete
power
both
inter
vivos
and
testamentary
to
determine
whether
these
lands
ought
to
be
alienated
to
read
the
right
of
an
indian
to
make
a
will
all
of
a
sudden
to
mean
that
in
this
particular
context.
in
other
words,
the
context
of
a
death
by
will
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
one
was
a
niece
and
three
other
would
be
the
grand
nieces
or
nephews.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
might
have
other
if
they
were
not
his
dependents
living
in
their
home.
they
may
be
included
in
another
allotment
from
another
household
but
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
would
not
be
included
in
his
allotment
only
his
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
wouldn't
say
it
that
flatly
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
congress
has
left
the
secretary
greater
discretion
than
that.
i
think
it
depends
to
policy
that
they
ought
to
generally
be
a
disposition
made
to
those
within
the
immediate
allotment.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
the
secretary
might
have
conceivably
found
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh!
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
he
certainly
would
have.
i
believe
at
least
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
any
reason
for
the
record
--
from
the
record
why
he
would
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
black
that
the
court
would
decide
whether
what
it
thought
was
fair.
i
think
that
the
regional
solicitor
would
decide
what
is
for
him
is
fair.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
understand.
no,
i
think
the
court
would
only
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
record
and
decide
whether
there
was
any
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
reason
of
regional
solicitor's
reasoning.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
under
the
very
limited
standard
of
review
of
a
discretionary
finding
of
administrative
agency
which
is
simply
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
substantial
reasons
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
uh-huh.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
in
the
final
analysis
if
the
secretary's
determination
will
reversed
his
discretion
would
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that
is
the
government's
contention
and
i
think
that
is
--
though
it
is
not
always
the
most
appealing
position
for
the
government
to
take
to
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
review.
i
think
that
all
of
these
special
provisions
under
which
allotted
properties
are
subject
to
the
guardianship
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
must
be
viewed
as
this
court
has
viewed
them
in
the
historical
context
of
the
government's
relationship
to
indian
tribes
in
tribal
lands
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
--
it
would
certainly
be
better
from
the
government's
point
of
view
if
the
words
final
and
conclusive
where
cited
again
in
section
2.
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
final
and
conclusive
language
was
not
repeated
in
section
2
because
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
was
so
clear
that
sections
1
and
2
were
complementary
provisions
in
which
together
encompass
all
of
the
secretary's
powers
with
respect
to
reviewing
disposition
test
--
disposition
in
death
of
restricted
lands.
and
we
have
cited,
i
think
considerable
positive
evidence
to
the
effect
that
congress
intended
for
both
section
1
and
2
provisions
to
be
non-reviewable.
i
just
read
very,
very
briefly
from
page
11
of
my
brief
from
the
same
date
which
this
court
on
the
basis
of
which
this
court
decided
in
section
1
determinations
were
in
fact
non-reviewable.
and
with
mr.
cox
asked
mr.
burke
under
the
provisos
that
now
exist
in
section
2,
“does
it
not
place
complete
power
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
over
the
will
of
an
indian
with
absolute
power
to
revoke
the
indians
will”
and
the
answer
is
“yes,
i
think
it
does.”
at
this
point,
i
have
must
ask
the
court's
permission
to
give
the
rostrum
to
correspondent
dorita
high
horse's
attorney
with
whom
i
agreed
to
spit
the
time
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
now,
the
government's
position
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
this
is
an
unreviewable
power
under
section
2
of
the
1910
act.
of
course,
we
are
basically
putting
forth
two
contentions
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
secretary's
determinations
are
in
fact
non-reviewable.
the
other
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
limited
standard
of
review
which
is
to
review
whether
the
secretary
has
exceeded
the
scope
of
his
authority
in
rendering
his
discretionary
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
question
was
not
reached
by
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
think
that
is
a
possible
disposition
of
the
case
and
it
would
understandable
if
the
court
chose
to
decide
this
way.
i
think
the
question
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
court
could
--
that
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
secretary
has
the
right
to
apply
equitable
considerations
to
the
case
that
this
court
could
reach
that
decision
quite
easily
and
remand
if
necessary
with
instructions
to
apply
that
rule.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
given
some
standard
of
review
and
i
think
that
the
standard
that
they
should
be
given
is
a
very
broad
one
that
the
secretary
has
extremely
wide
powers
in
this
area,
and
that
a
reversal
would
only
be
in
order
if
the
secretary
had
grossly
abused
his
scope
of
discretion.
i
would
like,
with
the
court's
permission,
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
historical
context
in
which
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
act
of
1910
appears
because
i
think
it
bears
--
this
historical
context
bears
very
heavily
on
both
of
them
contentions
that
the
government
is
making
in
this
case.
the
contention
that
the
secretary
is
given
absolute
discretion,
non-reviewable
and
the
contention
that
the
congress
intended
for
him
to
exercise
a
very
wide
range
of
considerations
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
will.
the
general
allotment
act
is
--
was
one
of
the
major
aspects
of
congress'
effort
to
make
reservation
indians
economically
integrated
and
self-sufficient
members
of
the
society.
under
the
allotment
system
prior
to
1934,
the
government
divided
and
allotted
reservation
properties
that
convey
them
to
individual
indians
and
their
families.
the
properties
were
conveyed
under
an
arrangement
which
this
court
has
characterized
not
as
a
technical
trust
arrangement
but
as
a
kind
of
special
guardianship
by
which
the
department
of
the
interior
is
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
restricting
alienation
of
the
indian's
interest
in
these
lands
and
furtherance
of
a
congressional
policy
which
this
court
has
described
as
“the
promotion
of
prudence
to
afford
protection
to
dependent
and
natural
heirs”
and
also
“preserving
restricted
land
for
the
indians.”
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
legal
relationship
is
a
very
special
one
between
the
government
and
reservation
indian
tribes
in
communities
and
that
special
relationship
has
survived
the
break-up
of
certain
reservations
and
the
allotment
to
individual
indians
of
tribal
lands
at
least
that
has
survived
with
respect
to
the
allotted
land
themselves
and
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
government
continues
to
guard
against
the
improvident
alienation
of
these
properties
by
the
indian
allottees.
it
was
congress'
hope
at
the
time
when
the
regional
allotment
act
was
passed
that
the
government's
guardianship
and
the
time
at
which
--
from
the
time
of
which
it
would
be
deemed
advisable
to
remove
restrictions
would
be
only
about
25
years.
it
was
hoped
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
his
lands
could
be
conveyed
to
the
indians
in
fee
simple.
in
the
majority
of
instances
however,
removal
of
the
restrictions
on
alienation
soon
resulted
in
the
acquisition
of
these
properties
by
parties
unrelated
to
the
indian
allottees
usually
in
fact
by
non-indians.
in
furtherance
of
the
statutory
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
which
was
to
preserve
the
value
of
the
allotted
properties
for
the
benefit
of
the
allotted
indians
and
their
families
in
most
cases
the
period
of
guardianship
has
been
extended.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i'm
about
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
that
a
reminder
of
the
historical
background
and
particularly
the
historical
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
which
was
to
ensure
that
these
conveyed
indian
lands
remain
for
the
benefit
of
indians
and
the
indian
allottees
and
their
families
is
rather
helpful
to
an
understanding
of
the
statutory
context.
it's
rather
helpful
to
an
understanding
of
range
of
the
secretary's
powers
in
approving
or
disapproving
alienation
of
indian
wills.
the
secretary
statutory
duty
to
preserve
these
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
allottee
during
his
lifetime
is
supplemented
by
a
duty
to
supervise
the
disposition
of
allotted
properties
upon
the
death
of
the
allottee
pursuant
to
the
act
of
june
25,
1910
which
is
the
act
under
consideration
of
this
case.
and
sections
1
and
2
of
this
act
taken
together
provide
a
complete
enumeration
of
the
secretary's
powers
over
the
disposition
of
allotted
properties
at
the
death
of
the
allottee.
section
1
as
you
know
authorizes
the
secretary
to
determine
the
legal
heirs
of
the
deceased
and
this
determination
or
statute
is
to
be
made
under
state
law
in
this
case,
the
law
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
section
1,
as
this
court
has
dealt
is
aware
provides
that
the
secretary's
determination
of
heirship
is
to
be
final
and
conclusive
and
requires
only
that
the
secretary
hold
a
hearing
with
notice.
this
court
has
explicitly
held
that
the
secretary's
determinations
of
heirs
are
not
reviewable
by
any
court.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
specifically
held
that
section
1
determinations
are
not
reviewable
even
if
errors
of
law
are
alleged.
this
is
the
first
moon
v.
white
tail
case
cited
in
our
brief
at
270
u.s.
243.
the
court
recognized
in
the
first
moon
case,
the
secretary's
unique
and
pervasive
role
with
respect
to
these
restricted
properties
and
found
that
“abundant
reason
for
the
provision
precluding
review
become
apparent
upon
considerations
of
the
infinite
difficulties
which
otherwise
would
arise
in
connection
with
the
sundry
duties
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
relative
to
indian
allotments.”
now
section
2
of
the
act
of
1910
which
is
of
course
the
key
provision
under
consideration
in
this
case
requires
the
secretary
in
a
case
in
which
the
deceased
indian
hast
left
a
will
to
approve
or
disapprove
that
will.
if
the
will
is
disapproved,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
the
property
passes
and
its
entirety
by
the
laws
of
intestacy,
that
is
the
restricted
property
(inaudible)
in
the
will.
a
determination
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
the
secretary
as
far
as
i'm
awareness
no
right
to
disapprove
any
disposition
of
that
other
property
at
all.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
restrictions
run
only
to
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
both
inter
vivos
and
testamentary
restrictions
run
only
to
the
restricted
property
and
of
course
tied
in
to
the
conveyance
of
the
restricted
property
at
the
time
the
allotment
is
made.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
believe
that
it
is
regardless
of
whether
he's
on
the
reservation
or
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
not
aware
of
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
make
a
will
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
only
with
respect
to
restricted
property
that
he
held
an
allotted
restricted
property.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
assume
the
secretary
in
the
case
of
such
a
testator
would
give
great
weight
to
the
testator's
will
and
would
assume
that
the
disposition
that
he
made
of
the
property
was
improvident.
and
i
assume
actually
that
by
this
time
such
a
person
would
have
been
granted
his
restricted
land
fee
simple
which
the
secretary
also
has
the
power
to
do.
but
if
by
some
chance,
he
still
held
land
under
a
subject
to
restrictions
then
the
secretary
would
continue
to
have
the
power
to
approve
the
power
to
approve
the
will
in
so
far
as
it
disposed
of
those
restricted
territories.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that
would
propose
a
very
naughty
question.
if
the
will
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
is
no
regulation
or
statutory
provision
prohibiting
him
from
willing
this
land
to
a
white
man,
but
the
purpose
of
the
--
and
the
mandate
given
to
the
secretary
by
the
allotment
act
by
the
act
of
1910
would
subject
the
secretary
to
very
close
scrutiny
if
he
were
to
or
would
cause
the
secretary
to
very
closely
scrutinized
any
will
which
gave
restricted
property
to
a
white
person.
i've
known
in
this
connection
that
there
was
in
one
time
that
at
the
moment
the
regulations
are
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
are
quite
general
and
don't
refer
to
what
specifically
what
types
of
considerations
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
approving
or
disapproving
the
will.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
there
was
at
one
time,
a
set
of
regulations
which
the
secretary
which
have
laid
out
in
the
numerate
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
that's
24
f.
2d,
i
don't
have
the
cite
for
me.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
there,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
regulations
are
very
silent
with
respect
both
to
the
factum
and
to
the
equitable
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account.
there
are
practically
no
technical
requirements
laid
down
at
the
regulation
at
all.
simply
that
that
testator
should
be
of
--
have
testimony
capacity
and
that
there
should
be
two
competent
witnesses.
unlike
the
section
1
determination
which
is
proscribed
according
to
state
law,
that
is
the
determination
of
heirship.
approval
of
the
will
is
subject
to
secretary's
own
standards
all
together.
there
are
no
technical
requirements
and
the
secretary
has
produced
very
few
technical
requirements.
the
regulations
in
short
like
the
statute
leave
the
secretary
and
his
delegates
with
maximum
flexibility
in
discretion
and
that
is
quite
in
harmony
with
the
entire
statutory
scheme
under
which
the
secretary
supervises
these
restricted
lands
both
during
the
lifetime
of
the
allottees
and
after
the
death
of
allottees.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there
are
other
instances
in
which
the
secretary
has
applied
equitable
considerations.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
there
are
--
i've
only
been
able
to
find
cases
in
which
the
will
has
been
approved
though
it's
clear
that
equitable
considerations
were
taken
into
account.
now,
that
i
have
been
able
to
locate
a
decision
that
is
cited
in
the
decision
of
the
regional
solicitor,
it
appears
to
be
unreported.
i've
searched
for
it
in
the
interior
department
cases
and
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
the
regional
solicitor
cited
one
case
and
which
a
will
have
been
disapproved
on
equitable
grounds.
now,
that
case
was
not
reviewed
later
by
any
court.
it
wasn't
brought
to
any
court
and
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
justice
burger,
i
believe
in
view
of
the
policy
of
the
general
--
of
the
allotment
act
to
preserve
indian
lands
--
restricted
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
allottees
and
their
families
and
dependents.
it
is
not
a
close
question
in
a
case
at
which
an
indian
has
totally
an
indian
allottee
has
totally
neglected
his
only
born
child
all
through
her
childhood
and
thereafter.
however,
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
know
whether
this
a
close
question
or
not
because
it
is
a
question
that
is
been
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
it
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes
and
that
is
--
it
is
the
government's
view
that
the
secretary's
discretion
at
least
applies
to
determining
whether
a
property
has
been
allocated
under
the
purposes
and
consistently
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
i
note
in
this
regard
if
the
chief
justice
is
interested
in
the
closeness
of
the
question
from
an
equitable
point
of
view
that
the
regional
solicitor
didn't
find
to
close
at
all
the
beside
of
the
fact
that
the
testator
had
made
five
or
six
wills
and
he
changed
his
place
of
residence
around
in
number
of
times,
so
that
he
seem
to
feel
that
there
wasn't
that
much
weight
to
be
given
to
the
equitable
considerations
on
the
side
of
approving
the
testator's
will.
and
he
felt
quite
compelled
by
the
fact
that
this
man
had
never
in
his
entire
lifetime
done
anything
to
support
his
daughter
which
was
--
and
never
used
any
of
his
substantial
income
from
his
restricted
properties
in
furtherance
of
her
support.
and
the
regional
solicitor
government
felt
that
this
was
quite
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
under
these
conveyances.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
believe
that
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case
are
indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
no,
i
divide
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
divide
that
point
up
into
two.
i
think
that
it
is
a
part
of
congress'
purposes
was
to
make
sure
that
these
lands
passed
on
to
indians
as
oppose
to
non-indians.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
the
other
point
which
i
think
was
really
more
central
and
it
was
born
out
by
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
the
congress
intended
for
the
specific
congress
was
looking
not
only
to
the
interest
of
indians
in
general
but
to
specific
allottees
and
their
immediate
families
are
dependents.
the
regional
allotment
act
allotted
land
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
a
family.
the
head
of
the
household
got
a
certain
amount
in
each
dependent
or
board
of
a
household
will
receive
a
smaller
amount
of
allotted
land
which
was
held
by
the
secretary
in
trust
for
that
individual.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
they're
most
certainly
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
would
like
to
quote
now
from
the
congressional
record
which
is
laid
down
at
pages
11
and
12
of
our
brief
a
conversation
occurring
in
the
debate
on
the
floor
the
house
of
representatives
between
mr.
--
representative
cox
of
indiana
and
mr.
burke
who
is
the
--
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
indian
affairs
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
discussing
the
reasons
why
the
law
of
1910
was
passed
congressman
cox
asked
congressman
burke
what
the
purpose
of
section
2
was
from
two
points
of
views.
he
was
interested
first
of
all
in
knowing
why
indians
were
given
the
power
to
write
wills
with
respect
to
restricted
properties
which
they
never
had
before.
and
furthermore,
what
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
role
was
with
respect
to
approving
or
disapproving
those
wills.
and
the
mr.
burke
cited
the
primary
case
to
which
he
thought
that
section
2
was
directed,
which
is
the
case
and
which
an
indian
allottee
has
after-born
children
who
are
not
covered
in
the
original
allotment.
and
in
the
case
to
that
kind,
the
indian
would
frequently
wish
to
have
these
after-born
children
provided
for
and
one
way
to
provide
for
them
would
be
to
give
them
a
disproportionate
share
of
his
own
allotment
upon
his
death.
now,
as
chairman
burke
says
and
i'm
now
on
page
12
of
my
brief.
in
a
case
of
that
kind,
undoubtedly
the
interior
department
would
okay
it.
whereas
if
it
was
a
will-giving
his
estate
to
some
person
who
ought
not
to
have
it
then
they
would
disapprove
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
there
--
is
it
necessarily
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
there's
no
provision
mr.
justice
marshall
for
giving
her
part
of
it.
the
only
power
that
the
secretary
has
is
to
approve
the
will
or
disapprove
the
will
and
he
must
take
into
account
which
of
those
produces
a
disposition
of
the
property
that
is
more
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
of
the
regional
allotment
act
to
preserve
his
land
in
the
fellow's
hands
and
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
to
give
some
considerations
at
least
to
the
testator's
will.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
from
a
technical
point
of
view,
i
believe
he
could
have
let
the
fifth
will
stand
if
it
will
still
an
existence
and
were
found
to
be
properly
executed,
he
could.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
and
counsel
for
correspond
dorita
high
horse,
mr.
hill
i
believe
is
better
acquainted
with
that.
however,
the
secretary
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
see
the
distinction
between
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
posed
that
narrowly
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
it's
better
posed
in
terms
of
whether
the
disposition
which
he
made
of
these
lands
is
in
harmony
with
the
purpose
of
the
allotment
act
which
was
to
keep
those
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
testator
and
his
family
or
more
generally
within
the
indian
community.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
there
is
certainly
a
distinction
but
necessarily
a
distinction
however
with
respect
to
that
and
i
think
the
laws
of
intestacy
bear
this
distinction
not
altogether
since
they
give
all
of
the
property
to
a
daughter
and
none
to
the
nieces
and
nephews.
there
is
a
distinction
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
secretary
made
the
decision
that
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
purpose
behind
the
allotment
for
this
girl
to
be
left
out
of
her
father's
will.
now,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
to
my
knowledge
it
doesn't
mr.
justice
white.
it's
possible
that
mr.
hill
may
be
better
acquainted
with
that.
i
didn't
pick
that
up
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
certainly
not
in
the
printed
record.
it
may
be
in
the
transcript
of
the
administrative
hearing
which
was
stipulated
out
of
the
printed
record.
i
don't
think
this
was
a
focus
of
the
hearing
examiner's
inquiries.
the
selection
from
the
congressional
record
which
i've
just
read
to
this
court
is
illuminating.
i
think
not
only
because
it
shows
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
secretary
broad
discretion
with
respect
to
whether
restricted
lands
ought
to
be
alienated
by
will
from
the
immediate
heirs
of
the
allotment
holders.
but
also
because
it
shows
that
the
purpose
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
gave
allottees
the
right
to
make
wills
was
not
to
abrogate
the
prior
policy
of
assuring
that
restricted
lands
remain
in
the
family
of
the
allottee,
but
rather
to
allow
the
allottee
in
certain
situations
greater
flexibility
in
providing
a
more
even
distribution
of
assets
to
his
own
heirs.
it
would
certainly
be
rather
startling
development
in
the
statutory
context
under
which
the
secretary
maintains
complete
power
both
inter
vivos
and
testamentary
to
determine
whether
these
lands
ought
to
be
alienated
to
read
the
right
of
an
indian
to
make
a
will
all
of
a
sudden
to
mean
that
in
this
particular
context.
in
other
words,
the
context
of
a
death
by
will
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that
one
was
a
niece
and
three
other
would
be
the
grand
nieces
or
nephews.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
might
have
other
if
they
were
not
his
dependents
living
in
their
home.
they
may
be
included
in
another
allotment
from
another
household
but
they
wouldn't
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
they
would
not
be
included
in
his
allotment
only
his
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
wouldn't
say
it
that
flatly
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
congress
has
left
the
secretary
greater
discretion
than
that.
i
think
it
depends
to
policy
that
they
ought
to
generally
be
a
disposition
made
to
those
within
the
immediate
allotment.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
the
secretary
might
have
conceivably
found
it.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh!
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
he
certainly
would
have.
i
believe
at
least
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
any
reason
for
the
record
--
from
the
record
why
he
would
not.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
black
that
the
court
would
decide
whether
what
it
thought
was
fair.
i
think
that
the
regional
solicitor
would
decide
what
is
for
him
is
fair.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
i
understand.
no,
i
think
the
court
would
only
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
record
and
decide
whether
there
was
any
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
reason
of
regional
solicitor's
reasoning.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
under
the
very
limited
standard
of
review
of
a
discretionary
finding
of
administrative
agency
which
is
simply
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
substantial
reasons
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
uh-huh.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that's
right.
in
the
final
analysis
if
the
secretary's
determination
will
reversed
his
discretion
would
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
that
is
the
government's
contention
and
i
think
that
is
--
though
it
is
not
always
the
most
appealing
position
for
the
government
to
take
to
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
review.
i
think
that
all
of
these
special
provisions
under
which
allotted
properties
are
subject
to
the
guardianship
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
must
be
viewed
as
this
court
has
viewed
them
in
the
historical
context
of
the
government's
relationship
to
indian
tribes
in
tribal
lands
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
--
it
would
certainly
be
better
from
the
government's
point
of
view
if
the
words
final
and
conclusive
where
cited
again
in
section
2.
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
final
and
conclusive
language
was
not
repeated
in
section
2
because
it
wasn't
necessary.
it
was
so
clear
that
sections
1
and
2
were
complementary
provisions
in
which
together
encompass
all
of
the
secretary's
powers
with
respect
to
reviewing
disposition
test
--
disposition
in
death
of
restricted
lands.
and
we
have
cited,
i
think
considerable
positive
evidence
to
the
effect
that
congress
intended
for
both
section
1
and
2
provisions
to
be
non-reviewable.
i
just
read
very,
very
briefly
from
page
11
of
my
brief
from
the
same
date
which
this
court
on
the
basis
of
which
this
court
decided
in
section
1
determinations
were
in
fact
non-reviewable.
and
with
mr.
cox
asked
mr.
burke
under
the
provisos
that
now
exist
in
section
2,
“does
it
not
place
complete
power
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
over
the
will
of
an
indian
with
absolute
power
to
revoke
the
indians
will”
and
the
answer
is
“yes,
i
think
it
does.”
at
this
point,
i
have
must
ask
the
court's
permission
to
give
the
rostrum
to
correspondent
dorita
high
horse's
attorney
with
whom
i
agreed
to
spit
the
time
in
this
case.
thank
you.
