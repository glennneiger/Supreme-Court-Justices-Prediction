apply?
i
put
that
question
even
before

i'm
not
clear
on
your

may
i
ask
you
at
the
outset
mr.

whether
the
power
to
review
a
will
and
grant
or
withhold
approval
is
one
which
the
secretary,
of

the
secretary
must
have
reasons
or
whether
do
you
think
it's
an
absolute
unreviewable
power?
chief

warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
if
the
court
of

having
thought
it
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all?
would
you
think
that
we're
to
go
back
to
them
that
they
might
need
some
guidance
as
to
what
standards
to
apply
to
the
review?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone,
looking
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general,
he's
posed
two
narrow
questions
whether
the
section
372,
that
was
apparently
with
373
is
final
and
conclusive
posture
or
status
to
his
decision
and
whether
he
may
take
equitable
considerations
into
account
now.
i
think
most
of
the
members
of
the
court
are
familiar
with
this
historical
background.
it
will
be
very
helpful
i
think
if
you'll
address
yourself
to
those
specific
questions.
chief

warren
e.

mr.
stone,
we
have
observed
that
we
don't
have
the
merits
before
us
but
the
merits
are
not
totally
relevant,
would
you
agree
that
a
contest
between
a
daughter
who'd
had
a
natural
but
illegitimate
daughter
who
had
relatively
little
contact
with
testator
and
a
niece
with
whom
he
had
lived
and
who
had
a
relationship
somewhat
like
that
of
a
natural
child,
is
it
close
question?
chief

warren
e.

well,
then
the
question
here
isn't
it?
that's
the
question
that
we
have
in

it's
been
left
entirely
to
his
discretion.
