mr.
houston
bus
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices
of
this
court.
in
order
to
enlighten
mr.
justice
white
and
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
one
point,
the
inquiry
was,
as
to
what
effect
this
will,
would
have
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
disapproved
that
then
there
was
unrestricted
property
which
would
be
handled
by
the
state
courts
in
our
state.
and
the
only
thing
about
the
unrestricted
property
in
open
the
state
of
who
we
have
a
statute
which
make
the
surviving
spouse
a
force
heir
to
the
one-third
of
the
property.
so
as
to
the
--
if
it
will
set
situation
by
then
the
surviving
spouse
of
the
entirely
one-third
regardless
of
the
will.
so,
and
the
only
thing
that
the
county
judge
or
probate
judge
might
take
into
consideration
the
fact,
that
either
the
secretary
acting
by
and
through
his
agents
had
either
approved
or
disapproved
their
will.
they
can
take
that
in
consideration,
it
might
be
persuasive
to
him.
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
bound
by
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
will
should
be
probated
in
the
county
court
of
that
county
on
the
unrestricted
property.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
normally
though
they
it's
required
that
they
make
some
indication
in
the
will
that
they
intended
to
deprive
that
child.
now
if
the
court
please,
i
handle
this
case
throughout
the
trial
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
i'm
fairly
familiar
with
the
facts
in
the
case
and
i
want
to
say
this
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
i
represented
dorita
high
horse
and
some
of
the
other
nieces
and
nephews.
now,
bear
this
in
mind
that
here
it
is
--
this
full-blood
comanche
indian
was
not
allottee.
he
inherited
this
land
itself
from
his
mother
and
some
of
the
others
on
the
general
allotment
act
of
february
7,
1887.
that
was
a
general
allotment
act
which
only
affect
the
wide
tribes
and
it
did
not
include
the
five
civilized
tribes
which
a
justice
have
mentioned
awhile
ago
by
justice
barefoot.
i
remember
the
choctaw
tribe
itself,
but
it
didn't
have
any
effect
upon
the
five
civilized
tribes
or
the
osage
tribes
themselves.
but
all
of
these
wide
tribe
particularly
the
kiowa,
the
comanche,
the
apache,
the
otos,
and
wichita
and
tribes
like
that.
now,
the
first
--
after
the
legislation
was
enacted
in
1910
giving
the
power
and
authority
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
determine
under
section
372
whether
or
not
the
certain
heirs
were
entitled
to
be
heirs
of
the
decedents
and
holding
that
i
am
on
that
statute
that
is
final
and
conclusive
for
then
in
section
373
of
that
act,
they
gave
the
power
authority
to
the
indian
to
make
a
will
if
he
is
21
years
of
age
pursuant
to
the
regulations
proscribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
then
it
was
not
valid
unless
and
until
it
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
then
it
could
be
approved
or
disapproved
by
and
after
the
death
of
the
indian.
and
normally
that's
the
way
we
handle
those
matters
down
there
--
they
wait
after
the
indian
dies
and
then
his
will
is
submitted
to
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
hears
a
hearing
on
this,
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
indian
was
competent
to
make
the
will.
and
whether
or
not
the
will
itself
complied
with
all
the
statutory
or
the
requirements
made
under
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
once
having
done
that,
then
he
determines
whether
or
not
there
are
any
other
causes
by
which
reason
by
which
he
might
say,
well,
i
don't
this
will
is
fair
and
equitable
because
it
didn't
take
care
of
the
decedents
or
testator's
heirs
themselves.
now,
ms.
dorita
high
horse,
it
is
true
that
she
didn't
live
with
her
father
who
was
george
chahsenah
but
the
trial
court
or
that
is
the
examiner
of
inheritance
found
that
she
was
the
illegitimate
child
of
george
chahsenah
and
that
she
didn't
get
any
benefits
from
his
estate
and
he
didn't
provide
for
all
her
during
that
period
of
time
and
even
that
she
became
of
age
then.
now
he
made
six
wills
down
there.
and
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
here
that
i'm
fairly
familiar.
the
first
will
he
made,
he
made
and
left
the
beneficiary
this
viola
atewooftakewa
which
is
her
name
and
she
was
married
to
man
by
the
name
of
james
tate
who
was
also
comanche
indian.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
she
was
a
niece.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
and
then
he
made
a
will
to
a
white
man
and
then
next
he
made
a
will
to
sammy
schweitzer
who
runs
a
grocery
store
there.
sammy
was
a
white
man
and
sam,
he
was
the
one
that
bail
him
out
every
time
he
got
put
in
jail
for
being
drunk
and
he
did
pay
his
fine,
he
did
give
loaning
money
and
he
testified
that
he
didn't
think
that
this
will
had
any
consequences
and
after
he
found
out
about
it.
he
thought
that
the
union
didn't
even
know
what
he
was
doing
and
that
was
part
of
the
testimony
of
course
that
i
tried
to
submit
to
the
examiner
of
inheritance
that
the
man
wasn't
even
competent
to
make
a
will
in
the
first
place
because
all
of
the
evidence
subs
--
all
the
evidence
was
to
the
effect
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
is
doing.
he
never
transacts
independence
for
himself.
he's
been
a
habitual
drunk
in
all
of
his
life
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
from
1956
to
1963.
he
died
--
he
made
his
last
will
in
the
early
part
of
1963
and
he
died
on
october
of
1963.
now,
bear
this
in
mind
that
up
until
1954,
he
lived
with
his
mother.
his
father
having
died
when
he
was
young
man
but
they
were
living
there
in
apache.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
that's
true
and
the
government
lawyer
draws
all
these
wills
your
honor
and
he
testified
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
somebody
in
there
drew
all
at
six
of
them.
yes
sir
and
they
--
under
the
rules
and
regulations
they
are
required
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
has
a
child,
perhaps,
any
surviving
brothers
and
sisters
or
mother
and
father.
now
they
didn't
ascertain
that
and
yet
it
was
on
the
record
there
and
yet
the
department
of
interior
bureau
and
affairs
they
all
stand
in
the
dark
hole.
they
did
have
this
child
dorita
high
horse.
she
was
on
chowan,
comanche,
and
apache
roles
when
they
made
the
for
cap
the
payment
in
1958
as
being
his
child.
and
his
nieces
and
nephews
knew
about
that.
they
knew
that
she
was
on
the
role
as
his
daughter.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
now
that
was
a
white
man,
i
don't
know
too
much
about
him.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
alright,
but
all
the
evidence
was
if
the
court
please
that
this
indian
was
an
alcoholic
and
he
would
do
anything
to
get
a
drink
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
but
normally
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
he
didn't
raise
the
question
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
no.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
he
wouldn't
be
the
one
that
were
be
in
there
all
that
time
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
at
least
the
officials
change
from
time
to
time
in
the
office.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
well
it
could
be
or
it
could
have
been
somebody
else
down
there.
they
might
have
someone
else
in
there.
it
wasn't
a
lawyer,
but
he
knew
how
they
drew
this
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
may
i
test
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
obviously
and
as
they
testified
that
they
had
no
independent
recollection
when
he
came
in
the
office
to
execute
this
last
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no
sir,
it
really
isn't
your
honor.
actually,
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well
the
trial
examiner
did
hold
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
they
have
found
his
property
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that
is
right
sir,
yes
sir.
and
naturally,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
that
but
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
know
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
basically
a
drunkard
and
who
would
make
a
will
on
the
slightest
provocation.
he
had
exchanged
goods
and
property
and
meat
and
grocery
and
everything
else
to
get
some
money
to
buy
his
liquor
and
he's
either
drinking
or
drunk
all
the
time.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
sir
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
he
was
with
this
last
beneficiary
on
the
will,
this
viola
atewooftakewa
and
children
and
the
family.
he
was
only
there
just
a
short
time.
he'd
been
living
with
all
these
other
nieces
and
nephews
from
time
to
time.
so,
he
wasn't
the
one
that
was
--
was
just
living
with
them
and
they
were
taking
care
for
anything
like
that.
they
didn't
take
care
of
him.
he
was
dependent
his
own
way
all
the
time.
as
a
matter
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no
sir,
there
is
not
sir.
no
sir.
now,
in
the
first
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
there
is
substantial
evidence,
your
honor
that
she
was
his
legitimate
daughter
and
under
section
371,
i
think
it
is,
that
where
the
cohabit
that
the
indian's
cohabit
and
there
are
0offsprings
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that
offspring
is
a
legitimate
child
and
the
examiner
of
inheritance
--
i
mean
the
secretary
of
the
interior
acting
by
and
through
the
solicitor
general
so
held
that
dorita
high
horse
was
the
natural
daughter
of
george
chahsenah
who
was
a
testator
of
his
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
right
and
other
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir
and
under
section
372
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
when
this
will
was
vacated
and
set
aside.
all
the
property
went
to
dorita
high
horse,
the
daughter.
now,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
said,
we
don't
need
to
go
in
into
these
other
wills
because
we're
familiar
with
them,
we
know
what
they
held.
they
didn't
even
mentioned
anything
about
dorita
high
horse
or
been
take
care
of
her
in
way
and
she
was
the
beneficiary
under
any
of.
so,
we're
setting
those
aside
too.
so,
it
isn't
like
justice
that
you
were
speaking
of
where
you'd
go
back
to
the
next
will
and
if
you're
going
back
to
the
next
will,
you're
going
back
to
discuss
them.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
at
least
she
wasn't
mentioned.
i
don't
think
he
didn't
attempt
to
care
of
him
but
he
certainly
did
mention
in
any
of
those
wills,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
she
would've
been
the
sole
heir,
yes.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
not
necessarily
though
i
think
this
all
purpose
of
making
a
will
was
to
going
to
get
some
money
and
buy
some
liquor,
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
if
he
hadn't
made
the
will,
she
would've
been
the
one
to
inherit
all
these
property,
yes
sir.
now,
i
handle
this
case
that
went
before
this
court,
homovich
versus
chapman
that
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
district
of
columbia.
and
that's
the
case
where
he
and
i
have
taken
the
position
and
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
under
section
2
or
373
that
--
of
course
could
refute
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
he
had
passed
of
owner,
he'd
approve
or
disapprove
the
will
and
that
case
he
approved
the
will
of
homovich.
homovich
was
a
full-blood
comanche
and
he
had
married
a
white
woman
who
was
a
school
teacher
(inaudible).
and
she
came
in
and
wanted
to
set
aside
this
will
so
that
she
can
participate.
and
then
it
was
almost
like
the
case
of
blanset
versus
cardin
which
came
up
from
this
side
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
the
qualified
indian
had
married
a
white
man
and
he
was
wanting
to
participate
in
her
estate.
and
that
was
the
leading
case
in
construing
this
particular
statutes
and
they
held
there
that
the
congress
under
its
plenary
powers
had
given
a
great
supervision
over
these
indians
and
their
property
and
they
placed
that
supervision
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
interior
although
the
discretionary
power
and
authority
necessary
to
take
care
of
that
without
any
interference
from
the
outside
by
the
court
or
anybody
else.
in
order,
we
did
we
respect
to
that
why
that
was
it
and
it
is
more
or
less
found.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
it
would
your
honor
but
i
think
here
and
i
think
the
court
here
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
who
would
get
this?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
in
the
event
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
dorita
high
horse,
the
daughter
would
get
the
property
if
my
argument
is
accepted,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
and
i
want
to
bring
this
out
and
since
this
case
has
been
in
litigation,
this
viola
atewooftakewa
who
was
the
niece
is
deceased
now
and
the
one
of
the
other
beneficiary,
one
of
the
other
nephews,
your
grant
nephew
is
also
deceased
so
that
only
two
children
left.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
it
does
and
it
probably
would
in
this
--
and
the
court
here
but
before
it
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
it
did
show.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
i
would
say
this
property
is
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
$50,000.00
to
$100,000.00
because
he's
got
some
production
on
it
if
the
court
please.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
the
official,
yes
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
i
would
say
that
worth
a
little
more
than
that
because
i
think
this
production
is
probably
made
a
worth
little
more
now
and
of
course
they
had
production
on
the
time
that
they
made
this
appraisal,
your
honor.
and
i'm
sure
they
were
trying
to
get
a
minimum
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir
it
was.
they
have
the
official
appraisal
after
any
of
these
indians
die
and
it's
under
the
supervision
of
the
area
officer
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
they
have
to
make
an
appraisal
of
these
properties
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
it
wouldn't
even
go
to
his
niece,
your
honor
because
she
is
deceased.
it
would
go
to
two
of
his
grand
nieces.
the
two
grand
nieces,
there
are
only
one
surviving
now.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
and
that's
what
the
congress
had
in
mind,
it
has
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir
and
that's
what
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
in
mind
when
he
asked
congress
to
pass
this
1910
act
was
to
give
him
all
this
power
and
authority
so
he
could
determine
these
things
himself
rather
than
leave
it
to
that
united
states
court.
and
certainly
that
was
the
first
time
that
they
have
any
authority
to
make
into
will
as
under
1910
act.
and
now
that
it
says
there
that
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
not
this
type
of
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
if
they
owned
personal
property
independent
of
their
--
of
this
is
restricted
property
which
is
being
held
entrust
to
the
united
states
general
allotment
act.
they
should've
dispose
to
that
property
since
if
it's
unrestricted
property,
but
restricted
property
could
not
be
dispose
off
by
the
indian
until
the
1910
act.
and
then
in
1913,
the
minute
section
373
saw
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
then
could
either
prove
or
disapprove
this
will
after
the
death
of
the
indian.
i
think
they
cited
that
sometimes
that
they
might
approve
this
will
before
the
indian
died.
and
then
they
would
be
caught
with
having
permitted
the
estate
of
this
indian
to
go
to
somebody
who
is
not
entitled
to
receive
it
or
they
shouldn't
receive
it
and
that's
the
whole
premise
behind
these
things
is
to
protect
these
indians
and
protect
the
indian
areas
of
these
testators
and
the
indians
who
took
advantage
with
this
section
to
make
a
will.
so
i
think
in
this
court
would
determine
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
under
this
--
they
claim
under
the
28
u.s.c.
section
3061.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices
of
this
court.
in
order
to
enlighten
mr.
justice
white
and
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
one
point,
the
inquiry
was,
as
to
what
effect
this
will,
would
have
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
disapproved
that
then
there
was
unrestricted
property
which
would
be
handled
by
the
state
courts
in
our
state.
and
the
only
thing
about
the
unrestricted
property
in
open
the
state
of
who
we
have
a
statute
which
make
the
surviving
spouse
a
force
heir
to
the
one-third
of
the
property.
so
as
to
the
--
if
it
will
set
situation
by
then
the
surviving
spouse
of
the
entirely
one-third
regardless
of
the
will.
so,
and
the
only
thing
that
the
county
judge
or
probate
judge
might
take
into
consideration
the
fact,
that
either
the
secretary
acting
by
and
through
his
agents
had
either
approved
or
disapproved
their
will.
they
can
take
that
in
consideration,
it
might
be
persuasive
to
him.
but
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
bound
by
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
will
should
be
probated
in
the
county
court
of
that
county
on
the
unrestricted
property.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
normally
though
they
it's
required
that
they
make
some
indication
in
the
will
that
they
intended
to
deprive
that
child.
now
if
the
court
please,
i
handle
this
case
throughout
the
trial
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
i'm
fairly
familiar
with
the
facts
in
the
case
and
i
want
to
say
this
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
i
represented
dorita
high
horse
and
some
of
the
other
nieces
and
nephews.
now,
bear
this
in
mind
that
here
it
is
--
this
full-blood
comanche
indian
was
not
allottee.
he
inherited
this
land
itself
from
his
mother
and
some
of
the
others
on
the
general
allotment
act
of
february
7,
1887.
that
was
a
general
allotment
act
which
only
affect
the
wide
tribes
and
it
did
not
include
the
five
civilized
tribes
which
a
justice
have
mentioned
awhile
ago
by
justice
barefoot.
i
remember
the
choctaw
tribe
itself,
but
it
didn't
have
any
effect
upon
the
five
civilized
tribes
or
the
osage
tribes
themselves.
but
all
of
these
wide
tribe
particularly
the
kiowa,
the
comanche,
the
apache,
the
otos,
and
wichita
and
tribes
like
that.
now,
the
first
--
after
the
legislation
was
enacted
in
1910
giving
the
power
and
authority
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
determine
under
section
372
whether
or
not
the
certain
heirs
were
entitled
to
be
heirs
of
the
decedents
and
holding
that
i
am
on
that
statute
that
is
final
and
conclusive
for
then
in
section
373
of
that
act,
they
gave
the
power
authority
to
the
indian
to
make
a
will
if
he
is
21
years
of
age
pursuant
to
the
regulations
proscribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
and
then
it
was
not
valid
unless
and
until
it
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
then
it
could
be
approved
or
disapproved
by
and
after
the
death
of
the
indian.
and
normally
that's
the
way
we
handle
those
matters
down
there
--
they
wait
after
the
indian
dies
and
then
his
will
is
submitted
to
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
hears
a
hearing
on
this,
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
indian
was
competent
to
make
the
will.
and
whether
or
not
the
will
itself
complied
with
all
the
statutory
or
the
requirements
made
under
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
once
having
done
that,
then
he
determines
whether
or
not
there
are
any
other
causes
by
which
reason
by
which
he
might
say,
well,
i
don't
this
will
is
fair
and
equitable
because
it
didn't
take
care
of
the
decedents
or
testator's
heirs
themselves.
now,
ms.
dorita
high
horse,
it
is
true
that
she
didn't
live
with
her
father
who
was
george
chahsenah
but
the
trial
court
or
that
is
the
examiner
of
inheritance
found
that
she
was
the
illegitimate
child
of
george
chahsenah
and
that
she
didn't
get
any
benefits
from
his
estate
and
he
didn't
provide
for
all
her
during
that
period
of
time
and
even
that
she
became
of
age
then.
now
he
made
six
wills
down
there.
and
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
here
that
i'm
fairly
familiar.
the
first
will
he
made,
he
made
and
left
the
beneficiary
this
viola
atewooftakewa
which
is
her
name
and
she
was
married
to
man
by
the
name
of
james
tate
who
was
also
comanche
indian.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
she
was
a
niece.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
and
then
he
made
a
will
to
a
white
man
and
then
next
he
made
a
will
to
sammy
schweitzer
who
runs
a
grocery
store
there.
sammy
was
a
white
man
and
sam,
he
was
the
one
that
bail
him
out
every
time
he
got
put
in
jail
for
being
drunk
and
he
did
pay
his
fine,
he
did
give
loaning
money
and
he
testified
that
he
didn't
think
that
this
will
had
any
consequences
and
after
he
found
out
about
it.
he
thought
that
the
union
didn't
even
know
what
he
was
doing
and
that
was
part
of
the
testimony
of
course
that
i
tried
to
submit
to
the
examiner
of
inheritance
that
the
man
wasn't
even
competent
to
make
a
will
in
the
first
place
because
all
of
the
evidence
subs
--
all
the
evidence
was
to
the
effect
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
is
doing.
he
never
transacts
independence
for
himself.
he's
been
a
habitual
drunk
in
all
of
his
life
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
from
1956
to
1963.
he
died
--
he
made
his
last
will
in
the
early
part
of
1963
and
he
died
on
october
of
1963.
now,
bear
this
in
mind
that
up
until
1954,
he
lived
with
his
mother.
his
father
having
died
when
he
was
young
man
but
they
were
living
there
in
apache.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
that's
true
and
the
government
lawyer
draws
all
these
wills
your
honor
and
he
testified
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
somebody
in
there
drew
all
at
six
of
them.
yes
sir
and
they
--
under
the
rules
and
regulations
they
are
required
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
has
a
child,
perhaps,
any
surviving
brothers
and
sisters
or
mother
and
father.
now
they
didn't
ascertain
that
and
yet
it
was
on
the
record
there
and
yet
the
department
of
interior
bureau
and
affairs
they
all
stand
in
the
dark
hole.
they
did
have
this
child
dorita
high
horse.
she
was
on
chowan,
comanche,
and
apache
roles
when
they
made
the
for
cap
the
payment
in
1958
as
being
his
child.
and
his
nieces
and
nephews
knew
about
that.
they
knew
that
she
was
on
the
role
as
his
daughter.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
now
that
was
a
white
man,
i
don't
know
too
much
about
him.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
alright,
but
all
the
evidence
was
if
the
court
please
that
this
indian
was
an
alcoholic
and
he
would
do
anything
to
get
a
drink
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
but
normally
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
he
didn't
raise
the
question
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
no.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
he
wouldn't
be
the
one
that
were
be
in
there
all
that
time
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
at
least
the
officials
change
from
time
to
time
in
the
office.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
well
it
could
be
or
it
could
have
been
somebody
else
down
there.
they
might
have
someone
else
in
there.
it
wasn't
a
lawyer,
but
he
knew
how
they
drew
this
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
may
i
test
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
obviously
and
as
they
testified
that
they
had
no
independent
recollection
when
he
came
in
the
office
to
execute
this
last
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no
sir,
it
really
isn't
your
honor.
actually,
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well
the
trial
examiner
did
hold
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir,
they
have
found
his
property
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that
is
right
sir,
yes
sir.
and
naturally,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
that
but
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
know
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
basically
a
drunkard
and
who
would
make
a
will
on
the
slightest
provocation.
he
had
exchanged
goods
and
property
and
meat
and
grocery
and
everything
else
to
get
some
money
to
buy
his
liquor
and
he's
either
drinking
or
drunk
all
the
time.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
sir
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
he
was
with
this
last
beneficiary
on
the
will,
this
viola
atewooftakewa
and
children
and
the
family.
he
was
only
there
just
a
short
time.
he'd
been
living
with
all
these
other
nieces
and
nephews
from
time
to
time.
so,
he
wasn't
the
one
that
was
--
was
just
living
with
them
and
they
were
taking
care
for
anything
like
that.
they
didn't
take
care
of
him.
he
was
dependent
his
own
way
all
the
time.
as
a
matter
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no
sir,
there
is
not
sir.
no
sir.
now,
in
the
first
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
there
is
substantial
evidence,
your
honor
that
she
was
his
legitimate
daughter
and
under
section
371,
i
think
it
is,
that
where
the
cohabit
that
the
indian's
cohabit
and
there
are
0offsprings
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that
offspring
is
a
legitimate
child
and
the
examiner
of
inheritance
--
i
mean
the
secretary
of
the
interior
acting
by
and
through
the
solicitor
general
so
held
that
dorita
high
horse
was
the
natural
daughter
of
george
chahsenah
who
was
a
testator
of
his
will.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
right
and
other
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir
and
under
section
372
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
when
this
will
was
vacated
and
set
aside.
all
the
property
went
to
dorita
high
horse,
the
daughter.
now,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
said,
we
don't
need
to
go
in
into
these
other
wills
because
we're
familiar
with
them,
we
know
what
they
held.
they
didn't
even
mentioned
anything
about
dorita
high
horse
or
been
take
care
of
her
in
way
and
she
was
the
beneficiary
under
any
of.
so,
we're
setting
those
aside
too.
so,
it
isn't
like
justice
that
you
were
speaking
of
where
you'd
go
back
to
the
next
will
and
if
you're
going
back
to
the
next
will,
you're
going
back
to
discuss
them.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
at
least
she
wasn't
mentioned.
i
don't
think
he
didn't
attempt
to
care
of
him
but
he
certainly
did
mention
in
any
of
those
wills,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
she
would've
been
the
sole
heir,
yes.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
not
necessarily
though
i
think
this
all
purpose
of
making
a
will
was
to
going
to
get
some
money
and
buy
some
liquor,
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
if
he
hadn't
made
the
will,
she
would've
been
the
one
to
inherit
all
these
property,
yes
sir.
now,
i
handle
this
case
that
went
before
this
court,
homovich
versus
chapman
that
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
district
of
columbia.
and
that's
the
case
where
he
and
i
have
taken
the
position
and
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
under
section
2
or
373
that
--
of
course
could
refute
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
he
had
passed
of
owner,
he'd
approve
or
disapprove
the
will
and
that
case
he
approved
the
will
of
homovich.
homovich
was
a
full-blood
comanche
and
he
had
married
a
white
woman
who
was
a
school
teacher
(inaudible).
and
she
came
in
and
wanted
to
set
aside
this
will
so
that
she
can
participate.
and
then
it
was
almost
like
the
case
of
blanset
versus
cardin
which
came
up
from
this
side
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
the
qualified
indian
had
married
a
white
man
and
he
was
wanting
to
participate
in
her
estate.
and
that
was
the
leading
case
in
construing
this
particular
statutes
and
they
held
there
that
the
congress
under
its
plenary
powers
had
given
a
great
supervision
over
these
indians
and
their
property
and
they
placed
that
supervision
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
interior
although
the
discretionary
power
and
authority
necessary
to
take
care
of
that
without
any
interference
from
the
outside
by
the
court
or
anybody
else.
in
order,
we
did
we
respect
to
that
why
that
was
it
and
it
is
more
or
less
found.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
it
would
your
honor
but
i
think
here
and
i
think
the
court
here
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
who
would
get
this?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
in
the
event
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
dorita
high
horse,
the
daughter
would
get
the
property
if
my
argument
is
accepted,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
and
i
want
to
bring
this
out
and
since
this
case
has
been
in
litigation,
this
viola
atewooftakewa
who
was
the
niece
is
deceased
now
and
the
one
of
the
other
beneficiary,
one
of
the
other
nephews,
your
grant
nephew
is
also
deceased
so
that
only
two
children
left.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
sir?
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
it
does
and
it
probably
would
in
this
--
and
the
court
here
but
before
it
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
it
did
show.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
i
would
say
this
property
is
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
$50,000.00
to
$100,000.00
because
he's
got
some
production
on
it
if
the
court
please.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
that's
the
official,
yes
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
i
would
say
that
worth
a
little
more
than
that
because
i
think
this
production
is
probably
made
a
worth
little
more
now
and
of
course
they
had
production
on
the
time
that
they
made
this
appraisal,
your
honor.
and
i'm
sure
they
were
trying
to
get
a
minimum
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes
sir
it
was.
they
have
the
official
appraisal
after
any
of
these
indians
die
and
it's
under
the
supervision
of
the
area
officer
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
they
have
to
make
an
appraisal
of
these
properties
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
no,
it
wouldn't
even
go
to
his
niece,
your
honor
because
she
is
deceased.
it
would
go
to
two
of
his
grand
nieces.
the
two
grand
nieces,
there
are
only
one
surviving
now.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
and
that's
what
the
congress
had
in
mind,
it
has
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
yes,
sir
and
that's
what
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
in
mind
when
he
asked
congress
to
pass
this
1910
act
was
to
give
him
all
this
power
and
authority
so
he
could
determine
these
things
himself
rather
than
leave
it
to
that
united
states
court.
and
certainly
that
was
the
first
time
that
they
have
any
authority
to
make
into
will
as
under
1910
act.
and
now
that
it
says
there
that
--
mr.
houston
bus
hill
not
this
type
of
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
well,
if
they
owned
personal
property
independent
of
their
--
of
this
is
restricted
property
which
is
being
held
entrust
to
the
united
states
general
allotment
act.
they
should've
dispose
to
that
property
since
if
it's
unrestricted
property,
but
restricted
property
could
not
be
dispose
off
by
the
indian
until
the
1910
act.
and
then
in
1913,
the
minute
section
373
saw
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
then
could
either
prove
or
disapprove
this
will
after
the
death
of
the
indian.
i
think
they
cited
that
sometimes
that
they
might
approve
this
will
before
the
indian
died.
and
then
they
would
be
caught
with
having
permitted
the
estate
of
this
indian
to
go
to
somebody
who
is
not
entitled
to
receive
it
or
they
shouldn't
receive
it
and
that's
the
whole
premise
behind
these
things
is
to
protect
these
indians
and
protect
the
indian
areas
of
these
testators
and
the
indians
who
took
advantage
with
this
section
to
make
a
will.
so
i
think
in
this
court
would
determine
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
under
this
--
they
claim
under
the
28
u.s.c.
section
3061.
mr.
houston
bus
hill
thank
you,
sir.
