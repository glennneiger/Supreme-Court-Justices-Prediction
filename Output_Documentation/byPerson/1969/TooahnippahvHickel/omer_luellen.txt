mr.
omer
luellen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
chief
justice
burger
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court,
this
case
300
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
tenth
circuit
it
pertains
to
the
approval
or
none
approval
of
the
will
of
an
indian
who
owned
first
a
restricted
properties
pursuant
to
our
federal
statutes
governing
the
disposition
of
indian
lands
upon
the
death
of
an
indian.
i
feel
certain
that
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
governing
statutes
under
which
we
are
discussing
this
case
are
found
in
two
sections
commonly
called
1910
act,
section
1
of
the
1910
act
which
now
has
been
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
372
and
section
2
of
the
1910
act
which
has
now
been
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
373.
372
pertains
to
the
determination
of
the
heirs
of
a
deceased
indian
that
has
an
allotment
or
who
will
in
the
future
have
an
allotment
upon
his
death
dying
without
a
will.
and
sections
1
or
372
proceeds
to
state
that
upon
the
death
of
the
said
indian
his
heirs
shall
be
determined
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
his
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive.
then
we
have
section
2
of
the
1910
act
which
is
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
373
which
states
that
if
an
indian
dies
owning
an
interest
in
trust
and
thus
it
really
say
an
indian
assess
any
person
die
owning
an
interest
in
trust
or
restricted
lands
or
funds
that
are
restricted
unless
he
shall
have
the
right
--
this
person
shall
have
the
right
to
make
a
will
provided
the
will
shall
not
have
any
force
or
effect
until
and
unless
--
unless
and
until
it
is
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
that
is
the
general
situation
here,
this
indian,
george
chahsenah
later
will
in
--
his
last
will
of
march
1963.
he
was
a
member
of
the
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
he
lived
at
a
little
town
of
apache,
oklahoma
located
about
20
miles
north
of
fort
sill
or
lawton,
okalahoma.
any
of
you
gentlemen
or
any
members
of
this
court
have
ever
been
to
fort
sill
in
world
war
i
or
world
war
ii.
actually,
it's
about
25
miles
north
of
fort
sill.
george
chahsenah
was
a
member
of
the
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
he
made
his
will
--
his
last
will.
he
made
several
wills.
i'm
certain
that
will
be
brought
out
here
later.
his
last
will
is
made
in
march
1963.
he
died
approximately
five
or
six
months
later
and
the
procedure
for
making
wills
where
the
indians
have
restrictive
trust
lands,
they
go
to
the
field
officers
of
the
bureau
of
indians
affairs
which
in
this
case
of
course
was
an
(inaudible)
about
30
miles
on
north
of
apache,
oklahoma.
he
went
there
in
march
1963
and
made
his
last
will
in
the
office
of
the
field
solicitor
and
his
will
was
properly
drawn
according
to
the
procedures.
then
he
died
some
six
months
later
and
his
will
of
course
was
presented
for
probate
and
several
hearings
were
held
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance.
can
our
blame
who
had
the
position
of
examiner
of
inheritance,
it's
a
position
created
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
giving
the
inheritance
examiners
a
general
authority
to
make
determinations
concerning
with
the
deceased
heirs
of
indians
who
died
without
wills
and
also
in
regard
to
the
approval
or
non-approval
of
their
wills.
they
had
four,
i
think
around
four
hearings
in
this
case
and
finally
the
examiner
of
inheritance
made
a
--
rendered
an
opinion
or
ruling
or
opinion
in
which
he
upheld
the
validity
of
this
will
of
the
george
chahsenah
and
he
approved
the
will.
in
his
finding,
which
of
course
is
contained
on
the
appendix,
he
goes
into
certain
findings
about
the
fact
of
this
indian
apparently
was
addicted
to
alcohol
and
perhaps
i
should've
said
prior
to
this
time
that
in
the
hearings
on
his
will
there
were
--
the
devisees
and
legatees
were
represented
by
legal
counsel.
the
certain
disinherited
nieces
and
nephews
were
represented
by
mr.
hill
and
also
dorita
high
horse
who
it
was
found
later
by
the
court
to
be
--
who
was
found
later
by
the
court
to
be
his
natural
daughter.
and
the
court
--
the
examiner
of
inheritance
felt
that
--
made
a
finding
that
although
this
indian
apparently
was
addicted
to
alcohol
and
it
was
an
excessive
drinker
and
he
make
some
different
wills
at
different
times
that
the
time
he
made
his
will,
he
was
perfectly
competent
to
make
his
will.
he
was
intoxicated.
in
fact,
some
of
the
will
was
proper
in
respect
and
the
examiner
of
inheritance
has
approved
the
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
no.
then
an
appeal
by
the
contestants
of
the
will,
the
appeal
was
taken
to
secretary
of
the
interior
as
directed
by
the
regulations
and
at
that
time
the
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
wills
of
indians
had
been
delegated
to
the
regional
solicitors.
originally
i'm
up
until
short
time
prior
to
that
the
--
what
those
appeals
or
appeal
to
the
portion
on
office
and
usually
the
solicitor
or
the
associate
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
made
these
determination
but
at
this
time
it
have
been
set
down
by
delegation
of
authority
to
the
regional
solicitors.
and
the
regional
solicitor
for
this
region
was,
tulsa,
oklahoma,
mr.
stanford
regional
solicitor
is
still
a
regional
solicitor
upon
the
hearing
before
the
regional
solicitor
--
upon
review
before
the
regional
solicitor,
the
regional
solicitor
found
that
the
factum
of
the
will
was
proper
as
the
examiner
of
inheritance
had
found.
he
found
that
this
dorita
high
horse
was
a
natural
daughter
of
deceased
george
chahsenah
and
he
found
although
the
factum
of
the
will
was
proper
and
have
a
respect,
the
fact
george
chahsenah
have
apparently
have
not
supported
the
dorita
high
horse
during
her
minority
that
there
had
not
been
an
equitable
treatment
of
the
heirs
of
law
of
george
chahsenah
by
his
will.
and
under
his
exam
--
the
regional
solicitor
set
up
from
his
discretionary
authority,
he
held
that
equity
had
not
been
achieved
and
he
disapproved
the
will
of
george
chahsenah
and
directed
that
the
estate
be
distributed
to
his
natural
daughter.
now,
he
also
in
his
order
disapproved
or
disallowed,
he
said
he
would
also
make
the
same
finding
as
to
any
other
wills
of
george
chahsenah
and
now
he
had
made
several
other
wills
prior
to
this
time.
so,
he
made
that
same
finding
in
regard
to
any
other
wills.
mr.
omer
luellen
right,
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
set
all
of
them.
that's
in
the
last
paragraph
of
his
--
of
the
regional
solicitor's
decision.
mr.
omer
luellen
in
the
will
has
written?(voice
overlap)
it
was
his
niece,
viola
atewooftakewa
tate
and
her
three
children.
he
had
lived
with
this
niece
of
considerable
portions
of
his
lifetime
and
he
was
living
where
at
the
time
of
his
death.
he
had
no
children
except
this
dorita
high
horse,
he
had
no
wife,
he
had
no
father
and
mother.
he
had
nieces
and
nephews
of
which
viola
was
one
of
them
and
then
he
gave
his
estate
to
viola
and
her
three
children.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes
the
--
under
the
decision
of
the
regional
solicitor
acting
and
delegate
authority
of
secretary
of
interior
he
held
that
equity
was
not
achieved
by
this
will.
the
indian
did
not
achieve
or
make
an
equitable
distribution
of
his
estate.
therefore,
his
will
was
disapproved
which
would
be
that
the
entire
estate
would
go
to
dorita
high
horse
because
the
examiner
of
inheritance
had
made
a
finding
that
she
was
his
daughter
and
heir
at
law.
mr.
omer
luellen
no.
on
appeal,
the
regional
solicitor
specifically
found
the
factum
the
way
it
was
proper.
all
the
technicalities
have
been
complied
with.
mr.
omer
luellen
the
regulations
provide
there
shall
be
no
implied
revocation
in
the
wills.
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
what
was
the
doctrine,
your
honor?
mr.
omer
luellen
you
mean
change
in
conditions
of
the
family?
mr.
omer
luellen
oh
yes.
i
understand
what
you
mean.
well,
the
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
there's
no
--
there's
no
regulations
precluded
falling
from
that
on
a
prior
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
had
the
record
and
i
believe
they're
in
the
record,
your
honor.
at
least
the
substance
of
the
will
--
prior
wills
are
in
the
record
what
they've
provided
it's
in
his
first
will
that
he
made
to
give
his
entire
estate
to
this
viola
atewooftakewa
tate,
the
one
that
later
on
came
in,
in
his
last
will
practically
his
entire
estate,
then
he
gave
some
miscellaneous
friends
some
properties
at
different
times
in
his
wills
in
between.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
divides
his
will
on
–
it's
found
at
appendix
page
64
--
mr.
omer
luellen
he
gave
it
to
his
niece
viola
atewooftakewa
tate
and
her
son
frankie
lee
tooahnippah
in
equal
shares
and
interest
in
allotment
of
rooker
roth
(ph).
mr.
omer
luellen
niece
and
her
son.
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
his
interest
in
one
allotment.
mr.
omer
luellen
the
natural
daughter,
the
one
that
he
does
not
mentioned
in
his
will
but
who
has
been
determined
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
call
it
an
illegitimate
mr.
hill's
adversely
he's
contesting
me
on
my
statement
of
illegitimacy.
she
is
his
daughter
born
out
of
wedlock,
at
least.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
never
lived
with
his
mother
except
maybe
for
a
short
interlude
--
mr.
omer
luellen
absolutely
the
fights
between.
mr.
omer
luellen
do
you
mean
if
the
will
is
upheld?
mr.
omer
luellen
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
upheld,
well,
it
will
go
to
the
natural
daughter
who
was
not
mentioned
in
his
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
all
of
it.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
sir.
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i'm
not
certain
who
the
next
prior
will.
i
think
it
went
to
a
nephew.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes.
okay,
you
have
that
there
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
no,
i'm
not
trying
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
in
which
the
secretary
acts.
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
interior
order
recess
about
an
indian
will
either
approves
or
disapproves
an
indian
will
and
that
is
final
and
conclusive
and
cannot
be
taken
judicial
review,
it
cannot
be
taken
of
the
said
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
not
so
far
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
can
say
the
statute
it
doesn't
apply
as
to
indian
will
as
to
that
term.
section
1
applies
to
intestate
succession
says,
it
shall
be
final
in
(inaudible)
in
this
court
in
two
or
three
cases
have
held
to
several
cases
upheld
that
determination
of
heirs
under
the
section
1
is
final
and
conclusive
and
i'm
not
settling
to
judicial
review.
but
section
2
does
not
have
the
final
and
conclusive
clause
that
the
determination
or
the
approval
or
non-t
approval
of
an
indian's
will
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
final
and
conclusive.
that's
all
admitted
from
section
2.
but
the
tenth
circuit
in
two
or
three
case
of
heffelman
case
then
the
attocknie
case
and
these
case
have
held
that
sections
1
and
2
complement
each
other
and
not
final
and
conclusive
as
it
applies
to
section
1
of
the
intestate
succession.
it
means
that
it
also
applies
or
complements
section
2.
therefore,
it's
final
and
conclusive
and
not
subject
to
judicial
review
by
the
court
even
though
the
--
mr.
omer
luellen
on
attacking
constitutionality
of
the
law,
this
--
my
position
is
that
section
2
does
not
have
a
final
and
conclusive
clause
and
therefore
--
mr.
omer
luellen
that
--
that
sir,
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
--
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
not
in
the
statute
your
honor.
i
mean
that
section
2
--
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
that's
the
primary
issue,
yes.
mr.
omer
luellen
although,
there
must
be
--
mr.
omer
luellen
what?
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
yes
it
will
be
a
matter
for
this
court's
construction
under
section
2.
it
means
it's
final
and
conclusive
or
rather
it
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
omer
luellen
i
don't
think
they
are
raised
on
constitutional
question.
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
my
opinion
i
hold.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
we
have
that
issue
too.
we
have
to
meet
one
issue
then
if
you
say
it's,
you
still
have
the
right
to
review
--
we
do
have
the
right
to
review
and
he
still
have
the
alteration
whether
the
court
--
whether
the
district
court
was
proper
in
this
case
or
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
is
proper.
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
the
primary
question
because
the
secretary
--
mr.
omer
luellen
no,
i
--
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
right,
it
did.
mr.
omer
luellen
they
say
that
the
decision
of
secretary
of
the
interior
was
proper.
of
course
we
count
instead
on
the
district
court
held
it
was
improper.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
that's
to
be
our
position,
yes.
but
we
feel
there's
no
statutory
preclusion
of
review
that
section
1
does
not
complement
section
2.
therefore,
it's
on
the
general
review
abilities
of
the
courts
to
review
that
sometimes,
some
place
there
must
be
a
question
to
have
an
action
of
administrative
personal
review
unless
statutes
preclude
review
and
we
feel
like
section
1
does
not
preclude
review
under
section
2.
now,
of
course
this
was
in
--
has
been
up
in
several
cases,
went
up
homovich
versus
chapman.
the
circuit
here
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
raised
that
point
in
that
case
so
it
was
not
subject
to
the
decision
of
secretary
of
interior
was
final
and
conclusive
found
and
not
subject
to
review.
and
in
homovich
versus
chapman,
the
decision
of
district
of
columbia,
they
held
it
was
subject
to
review.
then
later
on
you
have
a
hayes
versus
seaton
case
which
was
discussed
and
here
you
have
your
dissenting
opinion
in
hayes
versus
seaton
which
goes
into
that
much
in
detail.
then
they
come
along
with
the
heffelman
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
they
say
section
1
and
section
complement
each
other.
therefore,
you
cannot
review
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
decision
approving
or
not
approving
the
will
of
an
indian.
going
back
in
saying
section
1
complements
section
2,
of
course
then
this
the
factum
of
this
will
while
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
--
that
the
secretary
acted
in
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
direct
to
the
approval
of
the
will
as
it
goes
back
to
the
facts
of
course.
but
going
on
up
on
appeal,
the
tenth
circuit
rendered
into
the
facts
whatsoever.
they
just
had
no
jurisdiction
direct
effect
–
direct
to
the
action
be
dismissed
and
that
the
state
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
of
course
in
the
district
court
the
facts
were
going
into
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
--
that
in
this
case
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
acting
in
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
without
rational
for
his
decision
and
directed
that
the
state
be
distributed
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
will.
but
the
question
is
going
back
to
the
facts
in
that
particular
face
out
which
i
think
it's
in
to
this
case
and
the
way
you
heard
it,
it's
a
question
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
setup
there
and
determine
whether
this
indian
did
equity
to
his
heirs
and
has
he
have
not,
this
is
discretionary
authority
go
that
far
and
be
just
to
arbitrarily
say
to
an
indian,
well
i
won't
approve
this
will,
this
was
unjust
will,
unnatural
will
or
something
like
that
and
i
think
i
don't
believe
the
prior
cases
and
memorandum
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
1941
which
is
in
my
briefs
two
or
three
different
several
different
places,
at
that
time
it
was
thought
by
mr.
flanary
who
was
the
chief
of
the
indian
section
of
the
interior
that
the
will
of
an
indian
--
he
had
arrived
to
make
his
own
will
and
but
secretary
of
the
interior
didn't
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
substitute
his
will
for
that
of
the
indian.
mr.
omer
luellen
there's
no
--
mr.
omer
luellen
no
suggestion
of
that
kind
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
no
problem
because
i
don't
know
how
to
do
that.
mr.
omer
luellen
no
i
didn't
rely
on
that
but
they
--
mr.
omer
luellen
the
secretary
did.
i
say
that
that's
not
a
valid
disposition
unless
in
his
property
does
he
say,
we're
going
to
do
equity
or
was
worth
the
criteria,
or
could
you
ever
say,
in
one
sec.
we'll
be
done.
suppose
the
secretary
ought
to
say
as
i
put
it
one
of
my
briefs.
“well,
this
indian
here
is
a
member
of
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
comanche
have
been
notorious
warriors,
i
read
about
the
comanche
i
just
would
never
approve
of
a
will
of
an
indian
--
of
a
comanche.”
and
then
that
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
be
subject
judicial
review
but
it
also
be
subject
to
mandamus
i
think
on
the
1361,
i
don't
know
where
the
court
--
mr.
omer
luellen
he
has
no
power
over
the
said
property.
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
my
opinion
it
will
not
affect
the
other
property,
the
non-trust
property
and
non-restricted
property.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes.
now,
first
the
whole
setting
have
a
different
situation
where
you
have
to
have
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
approved
and
also
the
courts,
but
you
can
probate
an
indian's
will
where
he
had
two
witnesses
and
the
will
was
complied
with
oklahoma
statute.
in
fact,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
approve
his
will.
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
his
non-trust
property,
that's
my
opinion
at
least.
now,
this
will
gave
all
of
his
property
to
his
race,
i
didn't
finish
yet
of
course
the
next
(inaudible)
gave
to
his
--
he
gave
to
viola
tooahnippah
and
julia
tooahnippah,
daughters
of
viola
in
equal
shares
as
the
allotment
of
shares.
then
he
made
a
residue
clause
and
gave
all
of
his
residue
to
viola
and
her
three
children
--
his
entire
state
which
was
trust
and
restricted
property
was
distributed
and
taking
care
on
his
will.
he
never
did
mention
dorita
high
horse
in
any
of
his
will.
his
first
will,
he
gave
it
to
viola
–
that
the
niece
that
he
lived
with
almost
to
this
lifetime.
then,
in
a
period
of
some
three
or
four
years,
he
just
--
justice
stewart
i
believe
was
noting
that
(inaudible)
the
different
ones,
he
gave
his
properties
too
and
his
will
but
then
when
he
got
--
he
knew
he
was
in
bad
health
when
he
got
ready
to
really
go
on
out
into
this
other
world.
he
came
in
and
made
this
will
and
he
had
spelled
out.
he
told
certain
allotments
to
certain
persons
and
then
he
set
the
residue
to
these
four.
the
factum
of
this
will
is
never
been
disputed
but
the
only
this
is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
acting
through
the
regional
solicitor
said
that
he
said
he
did
not
achieve
an
equitable
purpose
because
he
could've
been
held
liable
for
the
support
of
this
indian
girl
while
she
was
a
mother.
therefore,
using
his
--
what
the
secretary
said,
his
discretionary
part
he
withheld
the
approval
of
this
will.
now,
district
court
said
that
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
there
is
no
rational
for
this
action
that
he
direct
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
approve
the
will.
and
then
on
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
that
circuit
court
said,
section
2
is
under
section
1
so
far
as
final
and
conclusive
it's
not
subject
to
judicial
review
and
they
refuse
to
review
it,
directed
the
case
to
be
dismissed
and
the
state
distributed
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
of
course,
i
filed
my
petition
for
certiorari
here
which
this
court
seems
fit
to
allow
and
a
lot
certain
what
the
action
he
would
take
if
it
either
--
suppose
direct
the
circuit
court
to
go
ahead
and
hear
that
case
on
the
facts
if
they
had
jurisdiction,
if
you
hold
they
had
jurisdiction
or
you
could
direct
to
be
distributed
as
directed
by
the
district
trial
court.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
so.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
they
were
to
imply
the
general
rules
of
reviews,
it
be
my
opinion.
i
don't
want
other
the
rules
they
would
and
i
think
it
be
the
general
rule,
yes.
i
believe
i've
taken
most
of
my
time.
i'll
(voice
overlap).
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
just
take
few
minutes
your
honor.
justice
harlan
made
some
inquiry
about
the
regulations.
they
are
found
in
the
brief
from
petitioner's
appendix
a
to
judge
most
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
whatsoever
about
an
indian
must
disperse
equity
when
he
makes
his
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
it
appeared
in
appendix
a
in
the
brief
for
petitioners,
appendix
a,
brief
for
petitioners.
mr.
omer
luellen
and
here
is
what
really
says
about
what
an
indian
is
making
an
approval
as
to
inform
an
indian
of
the
age
of
21
years
and
of
testamentary
capacity
who
has
any
right,
title
or
interest
in
trust
of
restricted
property
may
dispose
of
such
property
by
a
will
executed
in
writing
and
attested
by
but
two
disinterested
adult
witnesses.
that's
the
main
of
the
regulations
throughout
there
as
to
the
fact
of
the
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
that
was
section
--
that
was
on
page
--
the
appendix
a2,
a3.
mr.
omer
luellen
a3,
the
subsection
--
let's
see.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
1528.
mr.
omer
luellen
now,
in
those
will
forms
that
the
department
of
interior
prepares
who
sends
down
to
the
various
field
officers
for
the
government
employees,
the
government
attorneys
to
use.
it
has
instructions.
it's
in
my
reply
brief.
it
has
instruction
that
says,
to
be
sure
and
find
out
what
the
indian
wants
to
do
when
you
make
this
will.
it's
right
on
--
it's
printed
right
on
the
back
of
those
forms.
if
you
look
at
the
original
record
you'll
find
in
that
original
will
that
the
instructions
to
the
field
officers
telling
them
to
find
out
what
the
indian's
desire
or
nothing
whatsoever
about
finding
out
who
the
--
about
dispersing
equity
between
the
heirs.
now,
the
counsel,
mr.
stone
he
said
there
was
no
case.
he
could
find
no
case
where
they
had
disallowed
a
will
of
an
indian
for
equity
and
i
agree
with
him.
there's
no
case
where
they
never
drawn
out
any
will
and
said,
well
we
didn't
disperse
equity,
we
didn't
do
equity
therefore
we're
going
to
disallow
this
will.
this
will
be
i
think
a
new
field
in
that
respect
to
this
--
that
comes
of
the
law
in
this
case.
i
--
mr.
hill
mentioned
that
about
one
more
point
and
i'll
let
the
court
decide
this
case
and
which
you're
going
to
anyway.
but
mr.
hill
stated
that
this
niece
have
died
since
his
probated
and
since
his
hearing
have
been
held
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
one
of
her
children
have
died.
that's
immaterial
to
this
in
these
matters.
it's
very
well
dorita
high
horse
could've
died
the
next
day
and
that's
the
descendants
cast
as
of
day
of
the
death
with
the
testator.
what
happens
after
that
is
immaterial
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who's
going
to
die,
who's
going
to
live.
he
could
not
make
any
determination
about
that.
the
fact
that
one
or
two
of
these
devisees
or
legatees
has
died
since
this
matter
came
into
the
course.
that's
immaterial
in
this
matter
and
the
secretary
can't
sit
back
in
and
say,
well,
so
and
so
is
going
to
die
so
we
don't
give
it
to
them,
we
give
it
to
someone
else.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
omer
luellen
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
chief
justice
burger
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court,
this
case
300
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
tenth
circuit
it
pertains
to
the
approval
or
none
approval
of
the
will
of
an
indian
who
owned
first
a
restricted
properties
pursuant
to
our
federal
statutes
governing
the
disposition
of
indian
lands
upon
the
death
of
an
indian.
i
feel
certain
that
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
governing
statutes
under
which
we
are
discussing
this
case
are
found
in
two
sections
commonly
called
1910
act,
section
1
of
the
1910
act
which
now
has
been
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
372
and
section
2
of
the
1910
act
which
has
now
been
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
373.
372
pertains
to
the
determination
of
the
heirs
of
a
deceased
indian
that
has
an
allotment
or
who
will
in
the
future
have
an
allotment
upon
his
death
dying
without
a
will.
and
sections
1
or
372
proceeds
to
state
that
upon
the
death
of
the
said
indian
his
heirs
shall
be
determined
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
his
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive.
then
we
have
section
2
of
the
1910
act
which
is
codified
as
25
u.s.c.
373
which
states
that
if
an
indian
dies
owning
an
interest
in
trust
and
thus
it
really
say
an
indian
assess
any
person
die
owning
an
interest
in
trust
or
restricted
lands
or
funds
that
are
restricted
unless
he
shall
have
the
right
--
this
person
shall
have
the
right
to
make
a
will
provided
the
will
shall
not
have
any
force
or
effect
until
and
unless
--
unless
and
until
it
is
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
that
is
the
general
situation
here,
this
indian,
george
chahsenah
later
will
in
--
his
last
will
of
march
1963.
he
was
a
member
of
the
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
he
lived
at
a
little
town
of
apache,
oklahoma
located
about
20
miles
north
of
fort
sill
or
lawton,
okalahoma.
any
of
you
gentlemen
or
any
members
of
this
court
have
ever
been
to
fort
sill
in
world
war
i
or
world
war
ii.
actually,
it's
about
25
miles
north
of
fort
sill.
george
chahsenah
was
a
member
of
the
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
he
made
his
will
--
his
last
will.
he
made
several
wills.
i'm
certain
that
will
be
brought
out
here
later.
his
last
will
is
made
in
march
1963.
he
died
approximately
five
or
six
months
later
and
the
procedure
for
making
wills
where
the
indians
have
restrictive
trust
lands,
they
go
to
the
field
officers
of
the
bureau
of
indians
affairs
which
in
this
case
of
course
was
an
(inaudible)
about
30
miles
on
north
of
apache,
oklahoma.
he
went
there
in
march
1963
and
made
his
last
will
in
the
office
of
the
field
solicitor
and
his
will
was
properly
drawn
according
to
the
procedures.
then
he
died
some
six
months
later
and
his
will
of
course
was
presented
for
probate
and
several
hearings
were
held
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance.
can
our
blame
who
had
the
position
of
examiner
of
inheritance,
it's
a
position
created
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
giving
the
inheritance
examiners
a
general
authority
to
make
determinations
concerning
with
the
deceased
heirs
of
indians
who
died
without
wills
and
also
in
regard
to
the
approval
or
non-approval
of
their
wills.
they
had
four,
i
think
around
four
hearings
in
this
case
and
finally
the
examiner
of
inheritance
made
a
--
rendered
an
opinion
or
ruling
or
opinion
in
which
he
upheld
the
validity
of
this
will
of
the
george
chahsenah
and
he
approved
the
will.
in
his
finding,
which
of
course
is
contained
on
the
appendix,
he
goes
into
certain
findings
about
the
fact
of
this
indian
apparently
was
addicted
to
alcohol
and
perhaps
i
should've
said
prior
to
this
time
that
in
the
hearings
on
his
will
there
were
--
the
devisees
and
legatees
were
represented
by
legal
counsel.
the
certain
disinherited
nieces
and
nephews
were
represented
by
mr.
hill
and
also
dorita
high
horse
who
it
was
found
later
by
the
court
to
be
--
who
was
found
later
by
the
court
to
be
his
natural
daughter.
and
the
court
--
the
examiner
of
inheritance
felt
that
--
made
a
finding
that
although
this
indian
apparently
was
addicted
to
alcohol
and
it
was
an
excessive
drinker
and
he
make
some
different
wills
at
different
times
that
the
time
he
made
his
will,
he
was
perfectly
competent
to
make
his
will.
he
was
intoxicated.
in
fact,
some
of
the
will
was
proper
in
respect
and
the
examiner
of
inheritance
has
approved
the
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
no.
then
an
appeal
by
the
contestants
of
the
will,
the
appeal
was
taken
to
secretary
of
the
interior
as
directed
by
the
regulations
and
at
that
time
the
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
wills
of
indians
had
been
delegated
to
the
regional
solicitors.
originally
i'm
up
until
short
time
prior
to
that
the
--
what
those
appeals
or
appeal
to
the
portion
on
office
and
usually
the
solicitor
or
the
associate
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
made
these
determination
but
at
this
time
it
have
been
set
down
by
delegation
of
authority
to
the
regional
solicitors.
and
the
regional
solicitor
for
this
region
was,
tulsa,
oklahoma,
mr.
stanford
regional
solicitor
is
still
a
regional
solicitor
upon
the
hearing
before
the
regional
solicitor
--
upon
review
before
the
regional
solicitor,
the
regional
solicitor
found
that
the
factum
of
the
will
was
proper
as
the
examiner
of
inheritance
had
found.
he
found
that
this
dorita
high
horse
was
a
natural
daughter
of
deceased
george
chahsenah
and
he
found
although
the
factum
of
the
will
was
proper
and
have
a
respect,
the
fact
george
chahsenah
have
apparently
have
not
supported
the
dorita
high
horse
during
her
minority
that
there
had
not
been
an
equitable
treatment
of
the
heirs
of
law
of
george
chahsenah
by
his
will.
and
under
his
exam
--
the
regional
solicitor
set
up
from
his
discretionary
authority,
he
held
that
equity
had
not
been
achieved
and
he
disapproved
the
will
of
george
chahsenah
and
directed
that
the
estate
be
distributed
to
his
natural
daughter.
now,
he
also
in
his
order
disapproved
or
disallowed,
he
said
he
would
also
make
the
same
finding
as
to
any
other
wills
of
george
chahsenah
and
now
he
had
made
several
other
wills
prior
to
this
time.
so,
he
made
that
same
finding
in
regard
to
any
other
wills.
mr.
omer
luellen
right,
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
set
all
of
them.
that's
in
the
last
paragraph
of
his
--
of
the
regional
solicitor's
decision.
mr.
omer
luellen
in
the
will
has
written?(voice
overlap)
it
was
his
niece,
viola
atewooftakewa
tate
and
her
three
children.
he
had
lived
with
this
niece
of
considerable
portions
of
his
lifetime
and
he
was
living
where
at
the
time
of
his
death.
he
had
no
children
except
this
dorita
high
horse,
he
had
no
wife,
he
had
no
father
and
mother.
he
had
nieces
and
nephews
of
which
viola
was
one
of
them
and
then
he
gave
his
estate
to
viola
and
her
three
children.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes
the
--
under
the
decision
of
the
regional
solicitor
acting
and
delegate
authority
of
secretary
of
interior
he
held
that
equity
was
not
achieved
by
this
will.
the
indian
did
not
achieve
or
make
an
equitable
distribution
of
his
estate.
therefore,
his
will
was
disapproved
which
would
be
that
the
entire
estate
would
go
to
dorita
high
horse
because
the
examiner
of
inheritance
had
made
a
finding
that
she
was
his
daughter
and
heir
at
law.
mr.
omer
luellen
no.
on
appeal,
the
regional
solicitor
specifically
found
the
factum
the
way
it
was
proper.
all
the
technicalities
have
been
complied
with.
mr.
omer
luellen
the
regulations
provide
there
shall
be
no
implied
revocation
in
the
wills.
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
what
was
the
doctrine,
your
honor?
mr.
omer
luellen
you
mean
change
in
conditions
of
the
family?
mr.
omer
luellen
oh
yes.
i
understand
what
you
mean.
well,
the
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
there's
no
--
there's
no
regulations
precluded
falling
from
that
on
a
prior
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
had
the
record
and
i
believe
they're
in
the
record,
your
honor.
at
least
the
substance
of
the
will
--
prior
wills
are
in
the
record
what
they've
provided
it's
in
his
first
will
that
he
made
to
give
his
entire
estate
to
this
viola
atewooftakewa
tate,
the
one
that
later
on
came
in,
in
his
last
will
practically
his
entire
estate,
then
he
gave
some
miscellaneous
friends
some
properties
at
different
times
in
his
wills
in
between.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
divides
his
will
on
–
it's
found
at
appendix
page
64
--
mr.
omer
luellen
he
gave
it
to
his
niece
viola
atewooftakewa
tate
and
her
son
frankie
lee
tooahnippah
in
equal
shares
and
interest
in
allotment
of
rooker
roth
(ph).
mr.
omer
luellen
niece
and
her
son.
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
his
interest
in
one
allotment.
mr.
omer
luellen
the
natural
daughter,
the
one
that
he
does
not
mentioned
in
his
will
but
who
has
been
determined
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
call
it
an
illegitimate
mr.
hill's
adversely
he's
contesting
me
on
my
statement
of
illegitimacy.
she
is
his
daughter
born
out
of
wedlock,
at
least.
mr.
omer
luellen
he
never
lived
with
his
mother
except
maybe
for
a
short
interlude
--
mr.
omer
luellen
absolutely
the
fights
between.
mr.
omer
luellen
do
you
mean
if
the
will
is
upheld?
mr.
omer
luellen
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
upheld,
well,
it
will
go
to
the
natural
daughter
who
was
not
mentioned
in
his
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
all
of
it.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
sir.
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i'm
not
certain
who
the
next
prior
will.
i
think
it
went
to
a
nephew.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes.
okay,
you
have
that
there
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
no,
i'm
not
trying
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
in
which
the
secretary
acts.
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
interior
order
recess
about
an
indian
will
either
approves
or
disapproves
an
indian
will
and
that
is
final
and
conclusive
and
cannot
be
taken
judicial
review,
it
cannot
be
taken
of
the
said
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
not
so
far
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
can
say
the
statute
it
doesn't
apply
as
to
indian
will
as
to
that
term.
section
1
applies
to
intestate
succession
says,
it
shall
be
final
in
(inaudible)
in
this
court
in
two
or
three
cases
have
held
to
several
cases
upheld
that
determination
of
heirs
under
the
section
1
is
final
and
conclusive
and
i'm
not
settling
to
judicial
review.
but
section
2
does
not
have
the
final
and
conclusive
clause
that
the
determination
or
the
approval
or
non-t
approval
of
an
indian's
will
or
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
final
and
conclusive.
that's
all
admitted
from
section
2.
but
the
tenth
circuit
in
two
or
three
case
of
heffelman
case
then
the
attocknie
case
and
these
case
have
held
that
sections
1
and
2
complement
each
other
and
not
final
and
conclusive
as
it
applies
to
section
1
of
the
intestate
succession.
it
means
that
it
also
applies
or
complements
section
2.
therefore,
it's
final
and
conclusive
and
not
subject
to
judicial
review
by
the
court
even
though
the
--
mr.
omer
luellen
on
attacking
constitutionality
of
the
law,
this
--
my
position
is
that
section
2
does
not
have
a
final
and
conclusive
clause
and
therefore
--
mr.
omer
luellen
that
--
that
sir,
--
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
--
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
not
in
the
statute
your
honor.
i
mean
that
section
2
--
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
that's
the
primary
issue,
yes.
mr.
omer
luellen
although,
there
must
be
--
mr.
omer
luellen
what?
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
yes
it
will
be
a
matter
for
this
court's
construction
under
section
2.
it
means
it's
final
and
conclusive
or
rather
it
doesn't
mean
--
mr.
omer
luellen
i
don't
think
they
are
raised
on
constitutional
question.
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
my
opinion
i
hold.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
we
have
that
issue
too.
we
have
to
meet
one
issue
then
if
you
say
it's,
you
still
have
the
right
to
review
--
we
do
have
the
right
to
review
and
he
still
have
the
alteration
whether
the
court
--
whether
the
district
court
was
proper
in
this
case
or
whether
the
secretary
of
interior
is
proper.
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
the
primary
question
because
the
secretary
--
mr.
omer
luellen
no,
i
--
mr.
omer
luellen
that's
right,
it
did.
mr.
omer
luellen
they
say
that
the
decision
of
secretary
of
the
interior
was
proper.
of
course
we
count
instead
on
the
district
court
held
it
was
improper.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
that's
to
be
our
position,
yes.
but
we
feel
there's
no
statutory
preclusion
of
review
that
section
1
does
not
complement
section
2.
therefore,
it's
on
the
general
review
abilities
of
the
courts
to
review
that
sometimes,
some
place
there
must
be
a
question
to
have
an
action
of
administrative
personal
review
unless
statutes
preclude
review
and
we
feel
like
section
1
does
not
preclude
review
under
section
2.
now,
of
course
this
was
in
--
has
been
up
in
several
cases,
went
up
homovich
versus
chapman.
the
circuit
here
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
raised
that
point
in
that
case
so
it
was
not
subject
to
the
decision
of
secretary
of
interior
was
final
and
conclusive
found
and
not
subject
to
review.
and
in
homovich
versus
chapman,
the
decision
of
district
of
columbia,
they
held
it
was
subject
to
review.
then
later
on
you
have
a
hayes
versus
seaton
case
which
was
discussed
and
here
you
have
your
dissenting
opinion
in
hayes
versus
seaton
which
goes
into
that
much
in
detail.
then
they
come
along
with
the
heffelman
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
they
say
section
1
and
section
complement
each
other.
therefore,
you
cannot
review
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
decision
approving
or
not
approving
the
will
of
an
indian.
going
back
in
saying
section
1
complements
section
2,
of
course
then
this
the
factum
of
this
will
while
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
--
that
the
secretary
acted
in
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
direct
to
the
approval
of
the
will
as
it
goes
back
to
the
facts
of
course.
but
going
on
up
on
appeal,
the
tenth
circuit
rendered
into
the
facts
whatsoever.
they
just
had
no
jurisdiction
direct
effect
–
direct
to
the
action
be
dismissed
and
that
the
state
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
of
course
in
the
district
court
the
facts
were
going
into
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
--
that
in
this
case
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
acting
in
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
without
rational
for
his
decision
and
directed
that
the
state
be
distributed
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
will.
but
the
question
is
going
back
to
the
facts
in
that
particular
face
out
which
i
think
it's
in
to
this
case
and
the
way
you
heard
it,
it's
a
question
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
setup
there
and
determine
whether
this
indian
did
equity
to
his
heirs
and
has
he
have
not,
this
is
discretionary
authority
go
that
far
and
be
just
to
arbitrarily
say
to
an
indian,
well
i
won't
approve
this
will,
this
was
unjust
will,
unnatural
will
or
something
like
that
and
i
think
i
don't
believe
the
prior
cases
and
memorandum
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
1941
which
is
in
my
briefs
two
or
three
different
several
different
places,
at
that
time
it
was
thought
by
mr.
flanary
who
was
the
chief
of
the
indian
section
of
the
interior
that
the
will
of
an
indian
--
he
had
arrived
to
make
his
own
will
and
but
secretary
of
the
interior
didn't
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
substitute
his
will
for
that
of
the
indian.
mr.
omer
luellen
there's
no
--
mr.
omer
luellen
no
suggestion
of
that
kind
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
mr.
omer
luellen
no
problem
because
i
don't
know
how
to
do
that.
mr.
omer
luellen
no
i
didn't
rely
on
that
but
they
--
mr.
omer
luellen
the
secretary
did.
i
say
that
that's
not
a
valid
disposition
unless
in
his
property
does
he
say,
we're
going
to
do
equity
or
was
worth
the
criteria,
or
could
you
ever
say,
in
one
sec.
we'll
be
done.
suppose
the
secretary
ought
to
say
as
i
put
it
one
of
my
briefs.
“well,
this
indian
here
is
a
member
of
comanche
tribe
of
indians.
comanche
have
been
notorious
warriors,
i
read
about
the
comanche
i
just
would
never
approve
of
a
will
of
an
indian
--
of
a
comanche.”
and
then
that
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
be
subject
judicial
review
but
it
also
be
subject
to
mandamus
i
think
on
the
1361,
i
don't
know
where
the
court
--
mr.
omer
luellen
he
has
no
power
over
the
said
property.
mr.
omer
luellen
it's
my
opinion
it
will
not
affect
the
other
property,
the
non-trust
property
and
non-restricted
property.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes.
now,
first
the
whole
setting
have
a
different
situation
where
you
have
to
have
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
approved
and
also
the
courts,
but
you
can
probate
an
indian's
will
where
he
had
two
witnesses
and
the
will
was
complied
with
oklahoma
statute.
in
fact,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
approve
his
will.
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
his
non-trust
property,
that's
my
opinion
at
least.
now,
this
will
gave
all
of
his
property
to
his
race,
i
didn't
finish
yet
of
course
the
next
(inaudible)
gave
to
his
--
he
gave
to
viola
tooahnippah
and
julia
tooahnippah,
daughters
of
viola
in
equal
shares
as
the
allotment
of
shares.
then
he
made
a
residue
clause
and
gave
all
of
his
residue
to
viola
and
her
three
children
--
his
entire
state
which
was
trust
and
restricted
property
was
distributed
and
taking
care
on
his
will.
he
never
did
mention
dorita
high
horse
in
any
of
his
will.
his
first
will,
he
gave
it
to
viola
–
that
the
niece
that
he
lived
with
almost
to
this
lifetime.
then,
in
a
period
of
some
three
or
four
years,
he
just
--
justice
stewart
i
believe
was
noting
that
(inaudible)
the
different
ones,
he
gave
his
properties
too
and
his
will
but
then
when
he
got
--
he
knew
he
was
in
bad
health
when
he
got
ready
to
really
go
on
out
into
this
other
world.
he
came
in
and
made
this
will
and
he
had
spelled
out.
he
told
certain
allotments
to
certain
persons
and
then
he
set
the
residue
to
these
four.
the
factum
of
this
will
is
never
been
disputed
but
the
only
this
is
the
secretary
of
the
interior
acting
through
the
regional
solicitor
said
that
he
said
he
did
not
achieve
an
equitable
purpose
because
he
could've
been
held
liable
for
the
support
of
this
indian
girl
while
she
was
a
mother.
therefore,
using
his
--
what
the
secretary
said,
his
discretionary
part
he
withheld
the
approval
of
this
will.
now,
district
court
said
that
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
there
is
no
rational
for
this
action
that
he
direct
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
approve
the
will.
and
then
on
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
that
circuit
court
said,
section
2
is
under
section
1
so
far
as
final
and
conclusive
it's
not
subject
to
judicial
review
and
they
refuse
to
review
it,
directed
the
case
to
be
dismissed
and
the
state
distributed
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
of
course,
i
filed
my
petition
for
certiorari
here
which
this
court
seems
fit
to
allow
and
a
lot
certain
what
the
action
he
would
take
if
it
either
--
suppose
direct
the
circuit
court
to
go
ahead
and
hear
that
case
on
the
facts
if
they
had
jurisdiction,
if
you
hold
they
had
jurisdiction
or
you
could
direct
to
be
distributed
as
directed
by
the
district
trial
court.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
so.
mr.
omer
luellen
i
think
they
were
to
imply
the
general
rules
of
reviews,
it
be
my
opinion.
i
don't
want
other
the
rules
they
would
and
i
think
it
be
the
general
rule,
yes.
i
believe
i've
taken
most
of
my
time.
i'll
(voice
overlap).
mr.
omer
luellen
well,
i
just
take
few
minutes
your
honor.
justice
harlan
made
some
inquiry
about
the
regulations.
they
are
found
in
the
brief
from
petitioner's
appendix
a
to
judge
most
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulation
whatsoever
about
an
indian
must
disperse
equity
when
he
makes
his
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
it
appeared
in
appendix
a
in
the
brief
for
petitioners,
appendix
a,
brief
for
petitioners.
mr.
omer
luellen
and
here
is
what
really
says
about
what
an
indian
is
making
an
approval
as
to
inform
an
indian
of
the
age
of
21
years
and
of
testamentary
capacity
who
has
any
right,
title
or
interest
in
trust
of
restricted
property
may
dispose
of
such
property
by
a
will
executed
in
writing
and
attested
by
but
two
disinterested
adult
witnesses.
that's
the
main
of
the
regulations
throughout
there
as
to
the
fact
of
the
will.
mr.
omer
luellen
that
was
section
--
that
was
on
page
--
the
appendix
a2,
a3.
mr.
omer
luellen
a3,
the
subsection
--
let's
see.
mr.
omer
luellen
yes,
1528.
mr.
omer
luellen
now,
in
those
will
forms
that
the
department
of
interior
prepares
who
sends
down
to
the
various
field
officers
for
the
government
employees,
the
government
attorneys
to
use.
it
has
instructions.
it's
in
my
reply
brief.
it
has
instruction
that
says,
to
be
sure
and
find
out
what
the
indian
wants
to
do
when
you
make
this
will.
it's
right
on
--
it's
printed
right
on
the
back
of
those
forms.
if
you
look
at
the
original
record
you'll
find
in
that
original
will
that
the
instructions
to
the
field
officers
telling
them
to
find
out
what
the
indian's
desire
or
nothing
whatsoever
about
finding
out
who
the
--
about
dispersing
equity
between
the
heirs.
now,
the
counsel,
mr.
stone
he
said
there
was
no
case.
he
could
find
no
case
where
they
had
disallowed
a
will
of
an
indian
for
equity
and
i
agree
with
him.
there's
no
case
where
they
never
drawn
out
any
will
and
said,
well
we
didn't
disperse
equity,
we
didn't
do
equity
therefore
we're
going
to
disallow
this
will.
this
will
be
i
think
a
new
field
in
that
respect
to
this
--
that
comes
of
the
law
in
this
case.
i
--
mr.
hill
mentioned
that
about
one
more
point
and
i'll
let
the
court
decide
this
case
and
which
you're
going
to
anyway.
but
mr.
hill
stated
that
this
niece
have
died
since
his
probated
and
since
his
hearing
have
been
held
before
the
examiner
of
inheritance
and
one
of
her
children
have
died.
that's
immaterial
to
this
in
these
matters.
it's
very
well
dorita
high
horse
could've
died
the
next
day
and
that's
the
descendants
cast
as
of
day
of
the
death
with
the
testator.
what
happens
after
that
is
immaterial
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who's
going
to
die,
who's
going
to
live.
he
could
not
make
any
determination
about
that.
the
fact
that
one
or
two
of
these
devisees
or
legatees
has
died
since
this
matter
came
into
the
course.
that's
immaterial
in
this
matter
and
the
secretary
can't
sit
back
in
and
say,
well,
so
and
so
is
going
to
die
so
we
don't
give
it
to
them,
we
give
it
to
someone
else.
thank
you,
your
honors.
