mr.
kile.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
place,
a
map
or
a
sketch
or
a
drawing
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
we're
talking
about.
i
find
on
page
89a
of
the
appendix
a
--
what's
denominated,
exhibit
b
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
i
have
a
little
trouble
understanding,
i
wanted
to
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
fort
gibson,
southeast
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
then,
if
it's
decided
that
the
indians
own
the
bed
of
the
stream,
then
there
is
a
further
dispute
which
was
not
reached
by
the
district
court
between
the
two
indian
nations,
by
the
two
indian
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
that's
not
an
issue
here
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
from
the
confluence
of
the
canadian
river
and
the
arkansas
river
then
along
the
side
of
the
arkansas
river
as
it
flows
southeasterly,
that
river
is
the
boundary
between
the
choctaw
and
the
cherokee
grant,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we're
talking
in
totality
of
a
segment
of
the
river
that
extends
about
the
60
miles
or
so,
is
that
right,
looks
likely
on
the
scale?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
the
bed
of
the
--
bed
under
that
river
for
about
50-60
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
of
the
--
as
mr.
justice
white's
questions
seem
to
point
up
the
fact
that
there
are
two
grants
does
go
to
the
issues
before
the
court
here,
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
in
this
case
whether
it
is
navigable
or
not
navigable?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
their
argument
it
depends
upon
the
hypothesis
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
the
--
your
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
not
a
commercial
people
and
were
not
fishermen.
this
is
doesn't
have
to
do
unless
i'm
quite
mistaken
with
the
work
either
for
navigational
purposes
or
fishing
purposes
or
anything
else.
we're
talking
about
the
bed
of
the
river,
the
land
under
the
river
and
the
mineral
reserves.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
question
about
the
continuing
right
of
the
united
states
always
in
any
navigable
stream,
the
navigational
easement.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
water
fishing
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
here
is
not
water
but
land.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
in
the
previous
argument,
and
we
heard
that
it
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
really
that
valuable
as
people
had
originally
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
trying
to
say
mr.
claiborne
that
before
to
that
opinion
to
which
you
referred
in
318
u.s.,
there
has
been
many
cases,
captioned
such
and
such
a
nation
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
you
look
at
this
photograph
as
i
understand
it
to
the
right
of
the
old
channel
is
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
and
to
the
left
is
the
cherokees?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
the
old
channel
which
is
the
boundary,
not
the
new
channel,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
the
land
which
has
now
been
uncovered
because
of
the
construction
of
the
new
channel
is
that
land
that
used
to
be
under
the
old
channel
that
is
in
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
to
the
--
just
to
the
west
of
fort
smith?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
says
that's
along
the
channel
of
the
river?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
along
the
north
bank.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
said,
i
thought
you
read
that's
along
the
channel
of
the
river.
