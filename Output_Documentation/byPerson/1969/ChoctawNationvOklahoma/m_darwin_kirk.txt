mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
friends,
the
cherokees
have
produced
a
convenient
map
which
i
think
will
be
helpful
in
following
to
the
argument
which
i
will
make
and
i
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
that
map.
also,
you
might
find
it
helpful
to
refer
to
the
little
map
on
page
25
of
chapter
3.
now,
this
controversy
involves
the
bed
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
the
portion,
selected
by
the
cherokees
in
bringing
this
suit
in
1966
was
the
portion
commencing
at
the
arkansas
line
where
the
city
of
fort
smith
is
located
and
ending
where
the
grand
river
flows
into
the
arkansas.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
where
fort
gibson
is,
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
it
is
settled
that
the
arkansas
was
then
thought
to
be
navigable.
it
was
established
as
navigable.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i'm
not
--
we're
speaking
only
of
the
area
in
controversy.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
historical
evidence
is
that
there
are
a
few
miles
of
the
arkansas
and
a
few
miles
of
the
verdigris
that
are
navigable
and
were--
would
be
legally
sold
but
the
cherokees
didn't
choose
to
include
that
in
these
suits,
so
we
have
not
treated
it
in
the
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
it
is
now.
and
at
the
times
we're
talking
about,
the
times
these
treaties
were
made,
it
was
very
definitely
navigable.
the
stretch
of
the
river
is
a
meandering
stream,
as
you
see
it
from
that
map.
although
it
has
not
been
pertinent
in
this
case
and
no
evidence
has
been
introduced
on
it
and
our
engineer
estimates
that
there
are
a
little
over
a
100
miles
of
riverbed
in
this
stretch
of
the
river.
you
will
note
that
the
head
of
the
stretch,
fort
gibson
established
in
1824
and
at
the
foot
of
it,
fort
smith
on
which
the
first
military
establishment
appeared
in
1817.
this
area
has
been
substantially
used
in
commerce
during
this
decade
previous
to
the
time
of
the
signing
of
these
final
treaties
with
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws.
now,
let
us
keep
these
dates
in
mind.
the
first
treaty
that
the
eastern
cherokees
signed,
and
they
constituted
i
believe
about
four-fifths
of
the
entire
tribe,
was
in
1835.
all
treaties
previous
to
that
had
been
negotiated
with
the
western
cherokees,
who
then
i
believe
constituted
only
about
one-fifth
of
the
cherokee
members.
they
were
a
group
that
separate
from
the
rest
and
went
out
voluntarily
and
the
rest
didn't
want
to
negotiate
over
many
years
and
finally
arrived
in
the
agreement
in
1835.
now,
the
final
choctaw
treaty,
the
one
on
which
superseded
all
previous
treaties
and
the
one
upon
which
the
choctaw
claims
under
patent
is
based
was
executed
in
1830.
so,
in
this
decade
previous
to
that,
this
stretch
of
the
grand
river,
the
arkansas
river
up
to
the
grand
was
established
as
a
useful
artery
of
commerce.
the
trial
court
examined
into
the
available
facts
carefully
and
reached
a
very
definite
conclusion
on
that
subject.
the
trial
court
said,
“it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
court
as
to
this
issue
that
it
was
common
knowledge
in
the
legal
sense
from
at
least
as
early
as
1824
until
sometime
after
november
16,
1907,
the
day
of
oklahoma
state.
the
arkansas
river
in
its
natural
state
was
a
navigable
river
to
below
in
its
confluence
with
the
grand
river
regularly
used
throughout
the
remainder
of
its
course
in
what
is
now
oklahoma
as
a
highway
of
commerce
during
the
major
portion
of
each
year.
accordingly,
it
is
the
decision
of
this
court
based
upon
judicial
knowledge
alone
and
without
taking
the
evidence
that
this
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
was
never
navigable,
in
fact
and
in
law
at
the
time
the
western
domains
now
a
part
of
oklahoma
were
ceded
to
the
choctaw
nation
and
to
the
cherokee
nation
and
at
that
the
time
the
treaties
were
made
pursuant
to
which
the
lands
were
ceded,
and
also
at
the
time
when
oklahoma
was
admitted
to
statehood
november
16,
1907.
history
records
substantial
riverbed
navigation
along
that
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
but
during
this
period
there
were
regularly
scheduled
trips
at
the
ports
of
fort
gibson
and
at
the
ports,
free
ports
just
above
fort
gibson.
in
1833,
17
boats
regularly
docked
at
fort
gibson.
there
were
22
established
landings
between
fort
smith
and
fort
gibson
and
including
redland,
sallisaw,
webbers
falls
and
vian.
it
actually
was
the
only
method
by
which
substantial
commerce
could
come
into
this
area
and
as
a
result
of
this
navigable
water,
this
part
of
oklahoma
became
to
be
the
first
port
that
had
any
substantial
settlements
made
in
it.
it
was
a
vital
link
between
fort
smith
and
fort
gibson
and
the
bottleneck
between
fort
gibson
and
the
outside
world.
history
is
complete
with
the
records
of
substantial
stores
for
the
army
post,
recruits
being
brought
in
a
great
many
of
the
indians
who
later
came
in
under
this
treaties
were
brought
up
this
river
in
boats
and
steam
boats.
they
device
the
shallow
draft
steamboat
which
could
negotiate
this
river
very
well
in
the
major
portions
of
each
year
and
so
there
is
no
question
that
this
was
an
established
navigable
body
of
water
before
these
treaties
were
made.
it
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court
and
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
case
that
i
know
of.
the
ownership
of
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
and
i
should
say
that
the
arkansas
river
is
a
second
longest
tributary
of
the
mississippi,
the
longest
being
the
missouri.
the
negotiators
that
appear
into
the
louisiana
treaty
were
quite
cognizant
of
the
necessity
of
securing
all
these
waters
because
of
navigation
and
many
other
reasons.
in
a
later
date
of
may
13,
1803
from
robert
livingston
and
james
monroe
to
james
madison,
the
secretary
of
the
state,
the
writer
set
the
question
of
a
full
control
on
use
of
the
mississippi
river
and
all
streams
that
entered
into
it
from
their
sources
to
the
ocean
was
one
of
the
paramount
reasons
culminating
in
the
louisiana
purchase
of
1803.
president
jefferson
in
submitting
the
louisiana
purchase
treaty
to
congress
to
the
senate
for
ratification
to
congress
for
the
appropriation
said,
“whilst
the
property
and
sovereignty
of
the
mississippi
and
its
waters
secure
and
independent
outlet
for
the
produce
of
the
western
states
and
the
non-control
of
navigation
through
their
whole
course,
free
from
collision
with
other
powers
and
the
dangers
to
our
peace
from
that
source,
the
fertility
of
the
country
its
climate
and
extent
prowess
in
dew
season
the
important
age
to
our
treasury
and
ample
provision
for
our
posterity
and
the
widespread
for
the
blessings
of
freedom
and
the
equal
laws.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
state
of
oklahoma
sir.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
just
the
state
of
oklahoma,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
black
i
am
representing
actually
all
of
the
respondents
which
include
the
state
of
oklahoma's
lessees
also
its
oil
and
gas
lessees
and
its
sand
and
gravel
lessees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
leased
these
lands.
in
fact
it
has
been
leasing
them
since
about
1908.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
with
the
cherokee
tribe
or
the
choctaw
tribe
until
this
last
lease
was
instituted
in
1966.
the
state
of
oklahoma
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
nearly
60
years.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
oil
developed
thereon.
mr.
claiborne
i
believe
was
mistaken
on
that
subject
sure
he
was
in
good
faith
there
is
some
gas
production.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is
because
of
the
gas.
they
have
all
gas
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
there
is
some
gas
production
on
some
of
the
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
a
quite
recent,
just
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
i
would
think.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
this
controversy
is
between
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
the
cherokee
tribe
and
the
choctaw
tribe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
standard
values
of
land
should,
could
i
say
this
mr.
justice
black.
the
values
of
the
land
involved
far
exceed
the
value
of
the
minerals
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
no
other
claimant
to
the
lands
other
than
the
state.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
controversy,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
controversy
between
the
state
and
the
oil
and
gas
lessees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
there
is
not.
the
other
gas
lessees
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
because
they
hold
oil
and
gas
leases
from
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
from
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
from
the
indians,
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
not
if
the
state
of
oklahoma
prevails
they
have
good
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
if
the
state
of
oklahoma
does
not
prevail
then
they
would
have
to
make
their
piece
with
whichever
of
the
indian
tribes
does
prevail.
as
stated
yesterday
by
mr.
kile,
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
choctaws
and
the
cherokees?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
know
of
none
and
i've
not
heard
of
any.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
in
oklahoma
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes
the
value
is
not,
no.
and
the
oil
and
gas
development
actually
is
not
either
but
these
are
undisputable
facts.
the
law
is
and
we
have
set
it
forth
on
our
briefs
that
the
state
claims
the
riverbed
between
high
watermarks
and
that
was
established
years
ago
in
the
law
of
oklahoma
as
being
the
states
the
extent
of
the
states
claim
to
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
there
the
stream
is
being
stabilized
and
in
some
places
straightened
by
the
united
states
army
engineers
in
this
navigation,
arkansas
river
navigation
project
that
is
going
up
there.
at
least
a
considerable
amount
of
area
formerly
covered
by
waters
are
better
and
mr.
kile
mentioned
that
in
the
talking
about
in
the
evasive
bed
and
i
believe
that
is
what
he
intend
to
say.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
black
perhaps
that
could
be
assumed
but
it
is
not
a
fact.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
oil
companies
are
seeking
to
protect
their
respective
leases.
some
of
the
companies
have
only
one
lease
on
maybe
very
limited
area
of
riverbed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
some
of
the
oil
companies
do
have
only
one
lease
on
a
very
limited
area
of
riverbed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
i
say
one
you
may
find
one
company
that
will
have
only
one
lease
on
one
say
320-acre
track
which
then
composes
a
part
of
the
riverbed
but
we
have
a
100
miles
of
riverbed
here
to
consider.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
am
representing
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
its
lessees,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
its
lessees
are
the
oil
companies
and
the
sand
and
gravel
companies
that
are
parties
to
this
litigation.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'm
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
a
representation
of
title
yes.
i'm
certain.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
am
not
sure
of
the
amount,
what
is
the
1/8.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
few
of
them
are.
it
has
not
been
out
and
said
there
was
no
oil,
there
is
some
gas
and
there
has
been
rather
difficulty.
it
looked
a
lot
better
when
the
suit
started
and
it
does
now.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
indians
brought
to
suit
in
december
1966,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
the
first
suit
that
the
indians
have
brought
here
on
challenging
this
and
oklahoma
has
exerted
dominion
control
over
these
river
for
60
years
prior
to
that.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes
we
did,
we
exclude
many
all
gas
leases
and
sand
and
gravel
leases
to
this
market
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
past
three
or
four
years,
there
has
been
a
discovery
of
gas,
a
gas
field
over
in
this
area.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
that
got
them
interested
and
apparently
they
decided
to
file
their
suit
then.
they
stood
by
for
60
years
without
filing
any
suit
or
bringing
the
question
to
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
riverbed
and
composites
within
high
watermarks
are
great
deal
of
land
and
the
land
values
are
very
substantial.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
agriculture.
these
river
bottom
lands
that
--
where
the
river
is
now
being
controlled
through
the
navigation
project
are
very
valuable
lands.
they
can
be
smooth
over
with
a
bulldozer
and
put
on
production
some
of
it
has
high
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
that's
the
real
value
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
of
course,
the
gas
production
is
something
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
probably
yes,
probably
the
new
navigation
channel
makes
certain
areas
along
with
the
river
bed
valuable
for
sites
for
industrial
plans
or
any
number
of
things
but
the
navigation
project
plus
the
gas
development
somewhat
in
different
success
probably
have
something
to
do
with
the
indians
deciding
in
1966
to
file
their
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
actually
we
have
never
ascertained
it.
it's
a
very
difficult
civil
engineering
job.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
will
be.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is.
now,
mr.
kile
in
his
argument
yesterday,
referred
to
our
preliminary
statement
in
our
brief
and
states
that
he
accepts
the
challenge
in
that
statement.
that's
at
page
9
and
if
the
court
cares
to
refer
to
it
again
and
he
read
what
we
stated
and
i'm
going
to
read
it
again
because
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
on
this
point.
page
9
directly
under
preliminary
statement,
the
question
to
be
resolved
is
simple
and
direct.
did
the
united
states
convey
or
agreed
to
convey
the
riverbed
to
the
cherokees
or
choctaws?
the
answer
is
no.
not
by
the
standards
this
court
has
established
for
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
or
even
by
the
accepted
standards
of
ordinary
conveyancing
in
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below,
there
was
no
ambiguity
on
this
subject
and
each
of
them
concluded
that
the
treaties
and
patents
did
not
provide
for
a
conveyance
of
the
bed
of
the
river.
petitioners
not
having
met
to
burden
of
showing
inclusion
of
the
riverbed
under
their
treaties
or
patents
have
sought
to
shift
the
burden
by
arguing
that
the
state
must
show
that
the
united
states
reserved
the
riverbed
when
it
made
the
treaties
and
patents.
since
the
united
states
did
not
convey
the
riverbed,
there
was
no
need
to
reserve
it.
we
say
that
the
riverbed
was
not
conveyed
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
us
in
that.
now,
let
us
refer
to
the
language
of
the
treaties
and
the
patents
because
there
is
where
the
languages
upon
which
the
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws
or
the
cherokees
must
stand
or
fall.
in
the
treaty
of
october
18,
1820
with
the
chocktaws,
the
treaty
called
the
treaty
of
doak's
stand.
the
lands
ceded
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
whole
lengthy
description
but
just
to
part
only
part
that
refers
to
the
arkansas.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
this
is
not
in,
this
is

of
our
brief
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
tract
--
a
treaty
october
18,
1820
doak's
stand,
a
tract
of
country
and
i
haven't
included
all
of
this
and
i
am
not
going
to
read
all
that
might
be
the
descriptions.
a
tribe
and
only
the
parts
referring
to
the
arkansas
river,
a
track
of
country
west
of
the
mississippi
river
situate
between
the
arkansas
and
red
river
and
bounded
as
follows,
beginning
on
the
arkansas
where
the
lower
boundary
line
on
the
cherokees
strike
the
sand,
that's
up
the
arkansas
to
the
canadian
fork
and
up
the
same
that
source
and
so
forth
that
is
all
of
the
set
about
the
arkansas
river
just
dense
up
the
arkansas
and
that
treaty
but
they
do
make
it
quite
clear
it's
a
vast
track
of
land
that
lies
between
the
arkansas
and
the
red
river.
now,
if
you'll
look
at
that
little
map
on
page
25
of
the
choctaw
brief,
you'll
find
an
oversimplified
but
somewhat
helpful
map
which
shows
where
that
boundary
goes.
they
have
a
vast
track
there
between
the
arkansas
and
the
red
river
and
that's
what
the
government
agreed
to
convey
it
to
them.
now,
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they're
really
locating
that
because
of
the
arkansas
state
boundary.
the
cherokee
southeastern
corner
was
located
by
the
surveyor
isaac
mccoy
who
on
whose
basis
who's
surveying
the
cherokee
pattern
was
wrong.
on
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas
and
he
located
the
northeastern
boundary
of
the
choctaws
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas.
now,
let
us
take
this
treaty,
final
treaty
between
the
choctaws
and
the
united
states
in
which
all
the
previous
treaty
was
superceded
and
merged
you
might
say,
that's
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek,
september
13,
1830.
you
will
find
that
on
page
also
a
reference
to
that
at
page
59,
i
believe
of
our
briefs,
56
of
our
brief,
yes.
now,
the
beginning
near
fort
smith
where
the
arkansas
boundary
crosses
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
the
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
now,
that
is
the
only
margin
of
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
the
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
that's
all
as
said
about
the
arkansas
river
in
that
treaty
and
that's
the
final
treaty.
now,
their
patent,
their
patent
is
shown
--
the
choctaw's
didn't
set
up
their
patent
in
their
brief,
so
we
had
to
set
it
out
and
it's
shown
on
page,
appendix
5
of
our
brief,
patent
issued
to
the
choctaws.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
it
is
a
roman
numeral
xi
and
appendix
v.
patent
to
the
choctaws
dated
march
23,
1842.
i
won't
read
all
of
that
i
will
read
just
a
part
that
mentions
the
arkansas
river.
that
however
is
before
the
court
and
if
you
want
to
read
everything
that's
said,
it's
there.
the
united
states
under
grant
especially
to
be
made
by
the
press
of
the
united
states
and
they
were
citing
the
previous
treaty
the
year
1933.
the
united
states
under
grant
special
to
be
made
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
shall
cause
to
be
conveyed
to
the
choctaw
a
tract
of
country
west
of
the
mississippi
river
and
fees
to
them
and
their
descendants
to
inure
to
them
why
they
shall
exist
as
a
nation
and
live
on
it.
beginning
near
fort
smith
where
the
arkansas
boundaries
strike
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
if
you
are
in
the
limits
of
the
united
states
or
to
those
limits
hence
due
south
to
the
red
river
down
the
red
river
to
the
west
boundary
of
the
territory
of
arkansas.
thence,
north
along
the
line
to
the
beginning,
now
that
is
the
description.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct
the
red
river
is
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
correct
but
the
rule
is
different
on
a
navigable
stream
from
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
that's
correct
it
seems
clear
to
consider
there.
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is
our
position
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
state
upon
obtaining
statehood
acquires
the
bed
of
the
navigable
streams
and
that
united
states
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
future
states
to
be
formed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
state
does
not
own
any
non-navigable
streams.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
riparian
owners,
i
believe
on
the
south
side,
i
believe
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
as
riparian
owners
on
the
north
side
i
understand
that
they
claim
own
to
the
middle.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
treaty
didn't
say
that
the
treaty
said
that
the
lands
ceded
to
the
choctaws
shall
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
limits
of
the
future
territory
or
state
and
the
treaty
with
the
cherokees,
i
said
the
lands
ceded
to
the
cherokees
shall
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
limits
of
a
future
territory
or
state
without
their
consent.
we
think
that
getting
the
consent
of
the
choctaws
could
be
implied,
i
mean
they
could
always
consent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
they
didn't
consent.
no,
i
will
tell
you
that
there
were
later
treaties
in
which
i
did
consent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they
have
to
be
expressly
included,
yes.
they
have
to
expressly
included.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
my
throat
is
getting
a
little
hoarse
and
i'd
like
to
water
if
i
might
please.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
there
is
no
mentioned
of
navigability.
now,
with
respect
to
the
cherokee
treaties
and
patents,
we
have
and
if
you
wish
to
follow
it
in
page
50
in
reference
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
page
50
of
our
brief.
the
reference
is
to
the
reference
in
the
cherokee
treaty
of
may
6,
1828.
the
only
reference
to
the
arkansas
river
is
to
the
main
branch
of
the
arkansas
river
to
its
junction
with
the
canadian
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
on
page
50.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
of
our
brief.
yes
under
article
2.
the
complete
description
is
given
there.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
only
part
that
where
arkansas
river
is
mentioned
is
to
the
main
branch
of
the
arkansas
river
thence
down
said
river
to
its
junction
with
the
canadian
river.
now,
on
that
treaty
the
area
of
between
fort
smith
and
the
confluence
with
the
canadian
was
entirely
left
open,
it
wasn't
even
mentioned.
now,
that
was
a
treaty
with
the
western
cherokees.
we
have
maps
in
back
of
our
brief
that
shows
it.
now,
the
treaty
of
february
13,
1833.
now,
that
maybe
found
on
the
description
on
page
51
and
omitting
the
previous
language
and
going
only
to
where
it
mentions
the
arkansas
thence
down,
let's
see,
down
the
old
western
territory
line
of
arkansas
territory
to
the
verdigris
and
down
into
few
miles
and
i
know
this
first
mentioned
the
arkansas,
to
the
arkansas.
thence
down
the
arkansas,
as
you
can
see
is
just
a
few
miles
there
to
a
point,
thence
down
the
canadian
to
the
arkansas,
thence
down
the
arkansas
to
the
point
of
the
arkansas
where
the
eastern
choctaw
boundary
strikes
the
said
river.
now,
the
patent
is
the
new
echota
treaty,
the
one
which
the
eastern
cherokees
joined.
december
29,
1835
the
patent
is
shown
in
full
in
our
appendix
9,
back
to
the
cherokees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
29
in
a
roman
numeral
page.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they
haven't
been
very
specific
about
that,
mr.
justice
black,
but
apparently
they
invoke
all
these
treaties.
apparently,
i
hope
to
find
an
inclusion
somewhere.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
apparently,
that
is
their
contention.
now,
the
only
place
here
in
the
patent
where
the
arkansas
river
is
mentioned
is
where
it
says,
in
the
patent
on
page
30
top
of
page.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
in
my
notes,
i
apologize.
in
my
notes,
i'll
try
to
leave
out
anything
that
didn't
expressly
refer
to
the
arkansas.
well,
anyhow,
this
is
taken
from
this
treaty,
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas
river
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
now,
that's
only
reference
to
the
arkansas
river
there
except
the
reference
above
to
the
junction
with
the
arkansas
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
right.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
subject.
now,
that
is
found
in
the
appendix,
the
general
appendix
at
page
144a,
144a
of
the
appendix,
the
first
grammatical
paragraph.
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
question
on
that
yesterday
which
i
believe
was
not
answered
correctly.
i
call
attention
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
indians
seek
comfort
from
the
technical
language
of
the
treaties
and
grants.
they
attach
significance
to
such
phrases
as
to
the
arkansas
river.
down
the
arkansas
and
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas.
we
agree
with
oklahoma
that
references
to
the
arkansas
river
are
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
reference
points,
monuments
or
boundaries.
they
do
not
indicate
an
intent
much
less
a
clear
intent
to
convey
the
riverbed.”
now,
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
passing
on
these
treaties
and
patents
that
i
have
gratefully
referred
to
you.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
say
that
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
as
to
that,
that's
about
40%,
i
would
say
of
this
riverbed,
about
60%
lies
below
the
junction
where
the
canadian,
about
40%
has
the
cherokee
lands
on
both
sides.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
true
but
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct,
that
is
to
that
stretch
of
it.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
our
answer
to
that
is
that
there
was
no
clear
indefinite
specific
description
of
the
riverbed
in
the
treaties
or
the
patents
referring
to
that
portion
or
any
portion
of
the
arkansas
riverbed.
that
under
the
authorities
set
forth
in
the
decisions
starting
back
with
martin
versus
waddell,
pollard
versus
hagan,
shively
versus
bowlby,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
are
held
by
these
that
were
not
under
the
constitution
conveyed
to
or
relinquished
to
the
federal
government.
the
13
regional
counties
got
the
origin
of
the
waterbeds
of
the
navigable
waters.
the
states
then
submitted
were
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right
so
they
had
administration
over
them
and
they
would
only
the
policy
of
congress
as
set
forth
exhaustibly
in
shively
versus
bowlby.
it
expresses
the
fact
that
those
--
the
navigable
waters
are
never,
have
not
been
conveyed
away
except
under
exceptional
circumstance.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
under
certain
circumstances.
these
circumstances
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
shively
versus
bowlby.
in
order
to
perform
international
obligations,
to
effect
the
improvement
of
such
lands
or
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
with
four
missions
and
among
the
several
states
or
to
carryout
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
now,
a
counsel
for
cherokee
is
and
chocktaws
have
argued
that
they
come
within
the
last
exception,
you
might
say
to
the
general
rule.
we
say
they
do
not.
there
was
no
reason
for
--
they're
an
agricultural
people,
they
didn't
make
their
living
by
fishing,
they
didn't
make
their
living
by
commerce.
there
was
no
purpose
in
conveying
a
highway
of
commerce
already
established
to
them
in
the
treaties
with
them,
and
that
therefore
this
purpose
would
not
have
been
carried
out
in
conveying
to
them.
furthermore,
of
course,
we
say
they
were
not
conveyed
to
them
under
the
rule
of
holt
state
bank,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
they
have
done
a
few
cases
over
on
the
west
coast
where
small
water
covered
area
was
conveyed.
certain
indians
at
the
end
of
the
reservation
where
they
made
their
living
by
fishing
and
it
was
held
at
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
that
is
right.
well,
there
is
nothing
like
it.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
now
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
think
what
they
gave
them
was
what
those
conveyed
to
them.
now,
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
they
gave
up.
in
this
case,
what
they
got
was
what
was
conveyed
to
them.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
were
conveyed
the
property
in
fee
simple
subject
to
certain
very
important.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
had
fee
simple
except
that
they
are
the
patents
to
them
provided
that
the
choctaw
patent
provided
that
the
lands
hereby
granted
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
of
the
cherokee
nation
ceases
and
abandons
the
same
as
the
cherokee
patent,
excuse
me.
the
choctaw
patent
provides
that
the
land
shall
inure
to
them
as
long
as
they
shall
exist
as
a
nation
and
live
on
it.
occupancy
is
required.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
under
the
language
i
have
just
--
with
the
qualification
i
have
just
read.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
have
because
it
was
a
navigable
river
bottom
because
it
comes
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
river
is
navigable
and
the
bottom
follows
the
navigation
rights
established
by
the
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
one
we're
talking
about
mr.
justice
marshall
is,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
that
is
land
between
the
high
watermarks
previously
established
by
the
river
before
stabilization
by
the
united
states
army
engineers,
which
creates
an
artificial
evulsive
change.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
our
position.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
has
been
--
the
state
has
collected
a
revenue
over
from
this
riverbed
from
sand
and
gravel
and
oil
and
gas
leases
for
60
years.
it
has
been
of
value
to
the
state.
it
has
gotten
more
valuable
lately.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
did
not,
not
until
the
suit
was
filed
in
december
1966.
now,
the
holt
state
bank
rule,
in
that
case,
there
are
certain
reservations
were
established
for
the
chippewa
indian
tribes.
under
certain
treaties
made
prior
to
minnesota
statehood.
these
treaties
expressly
described
certain
land
as
being
reserved
for
these
indians.
they
do
create
a
reservation
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
have
argued.
the
statute
shows
it.
now,
in
the
red
lake
or
indian
reservation
were
then
the
boundaries
of
that
reservation
was
a
lake
called
mud
lake
that
the,
in
1889
of
the
treaties
last
treaties
were
1855
prior
to
minnesota
statehood,
state
being
admitted
in
1858,
i
believe.
the
treaty
of
1855
included
just
mud
lake.
in
1889,
the
government
made
a
further
treaty
with
the
indians
in
which
the
red
lake
reservation
was
to
be
ceded
by
two
of
the
government
and
was
ceded
back
to
the
government.
the
government
was
then
going
to
divide
the
land
into
tracks
and
sell
it
off
and
deposit
the
money
in
a
trust
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewa's.
a
number
of
tracks
were
sold
to
settlers
by
the
government
and
patents
issued
to
the
purchasers
along
the
shores
of
mud
lake.
later
on,
the
government
developed
a
project
to
drain
mud
lake
and
that
lay
bearer
certain
valuable
agricultural
land
between
riparian
lines
of
the
settlers
who
have
bought
from
the
government
and
the
water
placed
to
where
the
water
had
receded
and
they
claimed
as
riparian
proprietors
under
the
minnesota
law.
the
federal
government
suit
on
behalf
of
the
chippewa's
contending
that
this
lake
was
not
a
navigable
lake.
and
not
being
a
navigable
lake
that
when
it
was
drained,
when
the
water
was
drained
away
the
land
lake
bearer
did
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
riparian
proprietors
but
they
claimed
that
did
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
chippewa's.
it
was
within
red
lake
reservation
boundaries
and
there
is
no
question
to
that.
the
court
held
in
substance
that
in
the
treaties
with
the
chippewa's,
which
did
express
to
encompass
this
area
within
the
boundaries.
the
united
states
did
not
expressly
and
distinctly
convey
the
navigable
water
bottoms.
the
court
first
held
by
the
way
that
the
lands,
the
bottoms
were
navigable
contrary
to
united
states
that
mud
lake
was
navigable,
contrary
to
the
contention
of
the
united
states.
and
accordingly,
the
court
held
since,
there
was
no
specific
description
of
this
land
encompassed
all
around
by
the
reservation
boundaries.
but
there
could
not
be
inferred
any
intention
to
convey
the
navigable
water
bottoms
in
view
of
the
long
established
policy
of
this
country
to
hold
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
in
trust
for
future
states.
now,
that
in
substance
is
the
holding
in
the
holt
state
bank
and
we
think
it's
the
holding
under
which
the
part
of
the
arkansas
river
that
has
cherokee
land
in
both
sides
should
continue
to
be
owned
and
held
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
now,
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
other
side
seems
to
be
based
principally
on
the
agreement
in
the
cherokee
treaty
that
the
land
ceded
to
them
should
not
at
any
future
time
be
embraced
within
the
boundaries
of
a
future
state
without
their
consent,
remember
that,
without
their
consent.
the
choctaw
treaty
says,
the
lands
ceded
to
them
should
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
boundaries
of
a
future
territory
or
state.
now
in
1893,
by
act
of
congress
of
march
3,
1893,
27
stat.
645,
congress
created
a
commission
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
other
tribes
to
relinquish
tribal
rights
and
to
accept
allotment
of
their
lands
in
severalty
to
tribal
members
where
the
ultimate
object
of
including
said
lands
in
a
state.
the
result
of
this
act
and
ensuing
acts
of
congress
were
agreements
with
the
cherokees
32
stat.
716
and
with
the
choctaws
30
stat.
495,
and
42
stat.
641
in
1902,
which
provided
for
the
allotment
of
the
lands
to
individual
members
of
the
respective
tribes
and
relinquishment
of
the
general
powers
of
the
tribal
governments.
these
agreements
were
followed
by
the
act
of
april
28,
1904,
33
stat.
573,
which
supplemented
the
tribal
laws
and
put
the
laws
of
arkansas
in
effect
in
indian
territory.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
that
is
correct.
well,
the
now
in
1901
an
act
of
congress
was
passed
making
all
members
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
including
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
chickasaws
making
them
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
act
of
april
26,
1906,
continuing
tribal
governments
for
limited
purposes
ending
termination
of
some
future
state
and
for
regulation
of
tribal
affairs
under
the
interior
department.
the
interior
department
was
given
complete
and
comprehensive
regulation
over
the
tribes.
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
became
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
these
congressional
acts.
as
citizens
of
the
territory,
they
voted
with
other
citizens
in
the
elections
concerned
with
the
admission
of
oklahoma
to
the
union
and
oklahoma
was
admitted
on
november
16,
1907.
now,
the
tribes
continued
to
exist
in
a
sort
of
a
de
jure
form.
they
have
practically
for
everything.
there
is
very
little
that
their
tribal
governments
have
to
decide.
they
have
no
legislative
powers.
they
have
very
limited
administrative
powers.
everything
they
do
has
to
be
proved
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
w.f.
semple,
counsel
for
choctaws
for
many
years
later
on
their
principal
chief,
in
a
text
book
written
by
him
on
oklahoma
indian
land
titles
said,
“the
act
of
congress
of
april
26,
1906
in
continuum
of
the
tribal
governments
also
provided
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
could
remove
the
tribal
chiefs
or
appoint
one
in
case
of
death
or
removal.”
all
the
five
civilized
tribes
have
a
chief
or
governor
although
in
the
cherokee
and
seminole
nations
there
are
very
few
unsold
common
properties.
the
duties
principally
are
to
sign
deeds
to
the
remaining
lands
and
employ
attorneys
to
handle
claims
against
the
government.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
upon
oklahoma
statehood,
november
16,
1908,
i
mean
1906,
sorry.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
senator.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
senator
owens
is
elected
first
election.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
it
is
not
in
the
brief.
we
didn't
know
that
matter
is
going
to
the
combination
--
mr.
m.
darwin

house
report
number
2503
82nd
congress,
2nd
session.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
dated
december
15,
1952.
the
only
thing
i
want
to
read
from
you
was
that
is
this
statement,
“there
are
no
reservations
for
cherokees
or
choctaws
or
chickasaws
in
oklahoma.”
now
i
have
another
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
reservations,
their
lands
were
allotted
in
severalty.
there
are
citizens.
they
live
in
a
community
like
everybody
else
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
of
course,
actually
i
think
the
rest
of
the
nation,
those
has
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
cherokee
versus
georgia
when
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
stated
that
the
cherokees
were
not
a
nation,
so
that
could
bring
an
action
in
the
united
states
courts
and
he
at
that
time
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
nothing,
nothing.
they
are
certainly
tribes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
don't
question
their
right
to
maintain
the
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
the
question,
the
court
was,
was
interested
in
that
question
that
we
simply
supply
the
information.
i
don't
think
this
particular
material
except
that
there
are
civilized
members
of
the
community.
now,
the
question
was
asked
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
they
are.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
you
can't
tell
when
you're
talking
to
a
cherokee
or
a
choctaw
in
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
have
done
the
rest
with
them
all
my
life
and
i
never
know
when
my
member
is
a
cherokee
or
choctaw
or
what
he
might
be
so
they
are
mixed
with
whites
so
much.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
they
are
completely
immense
in
the
community
of
oklahoma.
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us.
in
fact,
one
of
my
co-counsel
mr.
groom
is
part
cherokee,
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
a
cherokee
indian.
now,
on
the
question
of
schooling,
we
have
a
1952
report.
we
have
here
this
is
house
report
number
2503
union
calendar
790,
82nd
congress
second
session.
a
report
and
it
seems
to
be
the
last
one
that
has
been
made.
on
the
agency
area
statistics
on
indian
education,
on
the
data
here
that
i'm
going
to
read
are
data
on
indian
children
ages
6
to
18
inclusive
having
one-fourth
degree
or
more
indian
blood
and
cover
fiscal
year
in
1952.
now,
five
civilized
tribes
there
is
nothing
separate
all
the
way
through
on
separate
tribes
here.
they
lumped
the
five
civilized
tribes
together,
cherokees,
choctaws,
chickasaws,
seminoles
and
creeks.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
and
creeks.
children
attending
public
schools
perhaps
of
last
tribes,
13,894,
children
attending
government
schools,
1,864
roughly
90%
are
attending
public
schools
and
the
others
schools
they
attend
are
government
schools.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
fortunately,
we
don't
make
--
they
have
to
make
that
contention.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
if
a
sufficient
--
if
there
were
sufficient
evidence
for
it
i
don't
think
congress
is
powerless
to
deal
with
the
lands
of
navigable
waters.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
question
that
exercise
of
power,
mr.
justice
white.
fortunately,
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
i
would
question
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
believe
it
says
at
the
south
side
of
the
river,
isn't
that
correct,
which
is
different.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
said
that
in
our
brief
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
do.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
the
field
notes
are
evidence,
i
would
say
and
in
this
case
they
are
evidence.
we
are
not
saying
this
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
sir,
we
don't
contend
these
field
notes
override
(voice
overlap).
we're
just
saying
they're
evidence.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
said,
we
said
it
would
be
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river.
that
is
a
boundary.
the
arkansas
river
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
cherokees,
no
the
cherokee
is
on
the
north.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
merely
for
the
purpose
of
locating
where
that
end
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
contend
that
as
merely
a
location.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
contend
that
as
merely
a
location
point
under
the
evidence
of
the
field
notes
is
pertinent
on
the
subject.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
we
don't
exactly
say
that,
we
say
no
that's
merely
a
location.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
reference.
it
is
a
location
for
the
lower
end
of
this
land.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
issue
is
whether
the
entire
bed
of
the
river
is
included
and
if
there
is
clear
and
definite
language
that
would
justify
and
warrant
the
inclusion
of
this
entire
bed
of
this
river.
we
say
there
is
no
such
language.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
word
“at”
if
you
note
the
footnote.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
all
right
“at”
that
point,
and
“at”
does
not
mean
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
no,
that
means
the
vicinity.
we
have
given
a
definition
of
that
in
the
note
there,
the
note
in
the
brief.
it
is
our
contention
to
review
that
this
has
establish
a
navigable
water
years
prior
to
the
time
of
these
treaties
and
patents
that
when
the
treaties
and
patents
were
made,
there
was
no
description
of
the
riverbed
that
would
constitute
a
conveyance
of
the
riverbed.
we
contend
that
the
provisions
and
the
treaties
to
the
effect
that
no
future
state,
the
lands
ceded
would
never
be
included
in
any
future
territory
or
state,
simply
meant
did
not
forever
renounce
the
possibility
of
this
land
ever
becoming
a
part
of
a
future
state
or
territory.
that
the
government
did
not
violate
its
covenant
with
the
indians,
that
it
sought
their
consent,
that
it
got
their
consent,
that
they
agreed
to
the
inclusion
in
a
future
territory
or
state
and
that
the
government
has
kept
faith
with
them
and
that
the
base
of
their
entire
argument
falls.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
have
--
we
do
not
have
a
record
exactly
of
that.
of
course,
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
to
a
ruling
by
the
interior
department
of
1908
to
the
effect
that
the
cherokees
do
not
own
this
land.
it
was
submitted
to
them
and
this
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
lowry
record
company
made
a
request
or
a
lease
from
the
interior
department.
a
letter
was
written
as
an
opinion
by
the
acting
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this
letter
was
written
in
response
to
an
application
made
by
the
lowry
record
company
to
interior
department
for
permission
to
enter
into
a
contract
to
take
sand
and
gravel
from
the
arkansas
river.
in
denying
jurisdiction
in
the
matter,
the
acting
commissioner
said
after
citing
authorities
among
them
shively
versus
bowlby.
in
other
words,
when
the
united
states
conveyed
by
warranty
deed
the
lands
occupied
by
the
cherokees,
creeks,
choctaws,
chickasaws,
and
seminoles,
it
did
not
convey
the
ownership
of
a
beds
of
navigable
streams
but
reserve
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
state
within
whose
boundaries
they
would
fall.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
march
27,
1908
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
that
has
remained
unchallenged
by
either
cherokees
or
choctaws
for
60
almost
60
years.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
now
we
have
records
in
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
of
cases
from
1913
to
1940.
i
can
give
you
citations
of
those.
united

works
also
in
the
federal

so,

139-943
1914,

versus

a
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
all
show
the
exercise
of
dominion
over
the
riverbed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
the
official
court
reports.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
very
well,
thank
you,
i
will
do
so.
so,
we
have
a
ruling
by
the
interior
department
on
the
subject.
we
have
these
successive
assertions
of
title
by
the
state
evidenced
that
in
these
various
decisions
i
have
cited.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
we
have
that
but
as
stated
today.
that's
correct.
they
differ
from
their
previous
position.
at
least
the
department
of
justice
does.
now,
there
is
one
thing
mr.
kile
has
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
should
be
controversy
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
indians.
there
would
have
to
--
there
would
be
a
controversy
between
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws.
in
the
trial
court
and
also
appearing
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
had
a
representative
of
certain
of
riparian
land
owners.
who
if
the
indians
should
become
victorious
on
the
tribe
under
whom
they
claim,
they
are
the
present
grantees
of
the
allottees
of
the
riparian
land
from
the
choctaws.
they
undoubtedly
will
and
their
interest
in
this
case
was
that
they
would
seek
to
recover
the
riverbed
from
the
choctaws
as
riparian
proprietors
and
those
questions
all
would
remain
to
be
settled
also.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
the
records
--
the
records
show
that
there
were
it
is
unchallenged.
we've
made
the
assertion
in
our
brief
and
there's
some
challenge
but
we
can
produce
the
records
if
you
would
like.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
if
there
would
be
i
believe
war
department
instructed
mr.
the
secretary
of
war
instructed
mr.
isaac
mccoy
to
make
this
survey.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
stated
to
me
the
purpose
on
making
the
survey.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
patent
was
granted
after
the
survey.
they
--
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
has
lapsed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
are
there
any
more
questions
you
like
to
be
asked?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
black
and
may
i
please
the
court.
we
have
enlarged
certain
map
appendices
from
our
brief
and
we
would
like
to
have
them
distributed
to
the
court.
we
think
it
would
be
easier
for
you
to
read
after
we
have
reduced
them
to
the
point
where
we
could
print
them
in
our
brief.
we
found
that
they
were
rather
difficult
to
read
and
we
think
this
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
they
were
to
be
considered.
the
first
one,
the
large
map
here
is
attached
to
our
brief
as
appendix
three.
we
have
completed
that
and
attached
it
on
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that
is
the
map
prepared
by
isaac
mccoy
from
which
the
cherokee
patent
was
prepared.
it
is
a
map
of
the
surveys
under
the
direction
of
isaac
mccoy.
the
other
enlargement
is
the
enlargement
of
our
appendix
four
from
our
brief.
this
enlargement
is
an
enlargement
of
the
copy
of
the
field
notes
of
the
surveyor
donaldson
who
did
this
surveying
under
the
direction
of
isaac
mccoy.
these
we
think
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
in
locating
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
boundary
lines
particularly
the
cherokee
and
in
locating
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
corners
at
or
near
fort
smith.
now,
the
trial
court
found
and
its
finding
was
not
challenged,
that
this
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
was
navigable
in
fact
and
in
law
at
the
time
the
western
domains,
now
a
part
of
oklahoma,
were
ceded
to
the
choctaw
nation
and
to
the
cherokee
nation
and
at
the
time
the
treaties
were
made,
pursuant
to
which
the
lands
were
ceded
and
also
at
the
time
oklahoma
was
admitted
to
statehood
on
november
16,
1907.
we
consider
the
fact
of
established
navigability
at
the
time
these
treaties
were
made
to
be
a
very
important
fact.
that
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court
and
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
case.
now
we,
in
substance,
rest
our
case
on
the
laws
of
governing
navigable
waters
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
particularly
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
shively
versus
bowlby
and
u.s.a.
versus
holt
state
bank.
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
mr.
justice
mckinley
in
an
opinion
written
in
1845
referring
to
an
opinion
written
in
1842
by
mr.
justice
taney
said
in
the
case
of
martin
et.
al.
versus
waddell,
16
peters
410,
the
present
chief
justice
taney
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
“when
the
revolution
took
place,
the
people
of
each
state
became
themselves
sovereign
and
in
that
character
hold
the
absolute
right
to
all
their
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
for
their
own
common
use,
subject
only
to
the
rights
since
surrendered
by
the
constitution.”
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
the
court
went
on
and
said,
“we
have
arrived
at
these
general
conclusions;
first,
the
shores
of
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
were
not
granted
by
the
constitution
to
the
united
states,
but
were
reserved
to
the
states
respectively.
second,
the
new
states
have
the
same
rights,
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
over
this
subject
as
the
original
states.
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
and
we
say
that
this
law
is
it
that
was
applicable,
set
forth
in
the
case
of
martin
versus
waddell
and
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan
is
still
applicable
today.
now,
the
most
complete
and
erudite
opinion
that
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
the
rights
of
the
states
with
respect
to
navigable
waters
was
written
by
mr.
justice
gray
in
the
case
of
shively
versus
bowlby
in
1893.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
gray
commented
that
this
was
an
occasion
suitable
for
a
complete
review
of
the
law
as
had
been
involved.
he
went
back
to
the
beginning
to
the
common
law
of
england
as
applied
in
the
american
colonies
to
the
common
law
as
applied
after
the
revolution.
he
reviewed
the
whole
range
of
decisions
that
had
been
handed
down
since
then
and
wrote
what
seem
us
to
be
a
guiding
opinion
in
this
litigation.
now,
he
did
say
that
he
--
when
the
united
states
acquires
a
territory,
it
does
have
a
demonstrative
jurisdiction
over
it
and
it
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
formation
of
future
states.
now,
he
says
some
certain
dispositions
can
be
made
when
necessary
by
the
united
states
during
territorial
period.
he
said
we
cannot
doubt
therefore,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
make
grants
of
land
below
high
watermark
of
navigable
waters
in
any
territory
of
the
united
states,
whenever
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so,
first
in
order
to
perform
international
obligations;
second
to
effect
of
improvement
of
such
lands
for
promotion
and
convenience
of
the
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
sovereign
states;
or
third
to
carry
out
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
now,
he
goes
further
in
that
opinion
and
he
defines
what
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory
are.
with
respect
to
that
he
said
this,
“and
the
territories
acquired
by
congress
whether
by
deed
of
cession
from
the
original
states
or
by
treaty
with
a
foreign
country
are
held
with
the
object
as
soon
as
their
population
and
condition
justify
it
of
being
admitted
into
the
union
as
states
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
in
all
respects.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
disposing
of
the
public
lands
has
constantly
acted
upon
the
theory
that
those
lands
whether
in
interior
or
on
the
coast,
above
high
water
mark
they
be
taken
up
by
actual
occupants
in
order
to
encourage
the
settlement
of
the
country.
but
the
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
whether
within
or
above
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
shall
be
and
remain
public
highways
and
being
chiefly
valuable
for
the
public
purposes
of
commerce,
navigation
and
fishery
for
the
improvements
necessary
to
secure
and
promote
those
purposes
shall
not
be
granted
away
during
the
period
of
territorial
government,
but
unless
in
case
of
some
international
duty
or
public
exigency
shall
be
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
or
public
exigency.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
have
mentioned
the
one
before.
the
first
three
that
we
mentioned
before:
perform
international
obligations,
effect
improvement
of
lands
for
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
sovereign
states,
or
to
carry
out
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
they
hold
the
territory.
and
they
defined
objects
for
which
the
hold
the
territory
as
being
the
formation
of
a
future
state
--
future
states,
that
is
the
object
that
he's
talking
about.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
domestic
purpose.
i
would
say
that
the
formation
of
the
future
state
would
be
a
domestic
purpose.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say
under
shively
versus
bowlby,
it
certainly
would
not
be
one
of
the
objects
for
which
united
states
holds
the
territory,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
think
it
would
be
yes.
i
would
question
it
under
shively
versus
bowlby.
now
we
go
further
and
say
however
we
don't
need
to
meet
that
because
it
didn't
convey
it
to
them.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'll
reach
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
am
indeed
sir.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
within
the
boundaries
of
the
cherokee
granted
here,
mr.
justice
white,
according
to
our
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
will
be
a
part
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
and
i
might
say
that
we
differ
on
the
facts
and
the
holding
of
that
case,
and
the
counsel
for
the
choctaws
who
has
argued
previously.
we
have
set
forth
however
our
understanding
of
the
facts
on
the
holding
of
that
case
on
pages
35
to
37
of
our
brief
and
we
refer
the
court
to
that.
i
won't
go
into
that
in
detail
here
at
this
time.
but
to
get
--
in
that
case,
the
court
actually
reaffirmed
the
principles
laid
down
in
shively
versus
bowlby
where
they
said
the
united
states
early
adopted
and
constantly
hasn't
heard
to
the
policy
of
regarding
lands
under
navigable
waters
and
acquired
territory
while
under
its
sole
dominion.
it's
held
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
future
states
and
so
has
refrained
from
making
any
disposal
thereof
say
in
exceptional
instances
when
impelled
to
particular
disposals
by
some
international
duty
or
public
exigency.
it
follows
from
this
that
disposals
by
the
united
states
during
the
territorial
period
are
not
likely
to
be
inferred,
should
not
be
regarded
as
intended
unless
the
intention
was
definitely
declared
or
otherwise
made
very
plain.
that
language
was
used
with
respect
to
a
statute,
the
united
states
statute
in
a
form
of
a
treaty
with
the
chippewas
which
set
aside
a
reservation,
a
red
lake
reservation.
within
the
reservation
was
a
navigable
lake,
mud
lake.
mud
lake
was
not
mentioned
as
being
conveyed
to
the
chippewas
and
the
court
held
it
was
not
conveyed
because
there
was
not
a
specific
reference
to
mud
lake
in
the
patent.
that
was
a
holding
in
this
case
of
this
court
in
holt
state
bank.
we
say
that
applies
with
respect
to
the
arkansas
river
here
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
part
where
the
cherokees
have
land
on
each
side.
now,
there
is
--
with
respect
to
the
chippewa
title
which
has
been
questioned
here;
that
title
we
think
is
a
good
reservation
title.
it
has
been
so
defined
and
held
in
minnesota
versus
hitchcock
185
u.s.
373
and
a
similar
type
of
title
has
been
affirmed
in
the
united
states
versus
santa
fe
pacific
railroad
company,
314
u.s.
339
with
respect
to
the
hualapai
tribe
in
arizona.
the
patents
issued
to
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
were
authorized
by
the
indian
removal
act
of
may
28,
1830.
that
provided
that
for
granting
patents
in
removed
indian
tribes
and
contained
a
provision
that
provided
always
that
such
land
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
if
the
indians
become
extinct
or
abandon
the
same.
so,
the
cherokee
patent
pursuant
to
that
indian
removal
act
provides
the
lands
hereby
granted
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
if
the
cherokee
nation
ceases
and
abandons
the
same.
the
choctaw
patent
provides,
it
shall
inhere
to
them
as
long
as
they
shall
exist
as
a
nation
and
live
on
it.
now,
coming
to
the
cherokee
treaties
and
the
cherokee
patent
on
the
subject
that
you
expressed
particular
interest
in,
mr.
justice
white,
the
western
cherokees'
first
land
in
oklahoma
was
acquired
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
1828,
7
stat.
311.
in
that
treaty,
it
was
agreed
that
seven
million
acres
of
land
plus
an
outlet
west
should
be
conveyed
to
the
cherokees.
the
description
of
the
land
was
incomplete.
when
they
got
to
the
--
where
the
arkansas
comes
to
a
confluence
with
the
canadian,
they
angled
off
up
between
the
two
and
they
didn't
close
it
with
the
arkansas
state
line,
but
they
have
provided
they'd
have
a
survey
and
which
would
correct
all
that.
the
1833
treaty
with
the
western
cherokees
has
also
covered
the
same
land
substantially
except
that
down
toward
the
lower
part,
the
boundary
line
between
the
creeks
and
the
cherokees
was
straightened
out
and
settled
whereas
under
the
1828
treaty
it
was
left
open
up
in
the
area,
i
might
say
it,
but
that
boundary
was
left
open
to
on
the
north
westerly
side.
but
the
parties
had
in
mind
having
a
survey
and
they
did
have
a
survey
and
it
was
conducted,
shortly
work
on
it
was
commenced,
shortly
after
the
1828
treaty,
under
the
direction
of
reverend
isaac
mccoy
who
was
commissioned
to
do
the
surveying
by
the
war
department.
the
map
which
we
have
provided
for
the
court
here
is
the
result,
the
final
result
of
reverend
mccoy's
surveying
work
down
under
reverend
mccoy
and
his
basis
for
the
description
in
the
cherokee
patent.
the
field
notes
which
we
have
provided
the
court
with
copies
on
enlarged
basis,
both
of
which
are
in
our
briefs
as
appendix,
describe
the
first
line
that
was
run
by
that
surveying
crew
under
mccoy's
direction
by
a
surveyor
by
the
name
of
donaldson.
in
that
line,
he
ran
the
line
between
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
cherokees
on
the
west
and
the
state
arkansas
on
the
east
when
he
comes
down
to
this
corner
and
he
uses
as
a
reference
point,
the
land
in
the
choctaw
corner
across
the
river
which
he
fixes
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
and
he
sets
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river.
now,
the
cherokee
patent
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
yes
that's
on
the
arkansas
line
just
west
of
fort
smith.
the
line
that
was
run
from
north
where
the
arkansas
river
runs
across
the
arkansas
state
line,
the
line
between
arkansas
and
the
cherokees.
now,
in
that
--
in
those
field
notes
which
you
have
a
copy
up
there.
this
surveyor,
they
are
very
voluminous,
we
have
the
field
notes
but
they
are
about
four
inches
thick.
we
only
put
in
the
part
referring
to
this
problem
and
here's
what
the
surveyor
says
in
respect
to
that
point.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'm
quoting
from
our
appendix
four,

is

at

has
fixed
the

corner
of
the
cherokee
lands.
that's
along
the
channel
of
the
river

chance
to
the
south
bank
where
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
choctaw
land
strikes
the
river.
now,
he
does
that
for
a
reference
point.
he's
surveying
the
cherokee
boundary,
but
he
is
referring
to
another
point
which
helped
set
up
his
point,
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
a
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
on
the
north
bank
he
says.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
said
after
he
fixes
the
north
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right,
right,
and
right
and
there
he
fixes
the
choctaw
corner.
so
he
fixes
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
north
bank
and
the
choctaw
corner
on
the
south
bank.
now,
let's
take
the
--
now
those
field
notes
are
--
should
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
cherokee
patent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say
that
if
it's
in
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states,
the
description
would
have
called
for
it
to
be
down
the
middle
of
the
stream.
we
have
--
we
have
cited
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
not
a
rule
of
construction,
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
have
cited
on
our
brief
the
conveyance
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
we
have
a
contemporaneous
patent.
we
have
a
contemporaneous
definition
of
the
line
of
the
state
of
missouri
which
we
have
cited
on
the
brief
which
was
made
an
1820,
almost
contemporaneous
with
these
documents
and
they
called
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
this
is
a
navigable
stream.
in
this
case
there
is
no
--
this
particular
authority,
you're
reading
to
me,
i'm
not
sure
the
context
of
it,
or
what
it
would
be
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
any
event,
let
me
read
from
you
from
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
mingus
case.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
atlantic
pacific
railroad
company
versus
mingus,
165
u.s.
413
and
referring
to
the
--
these
indian
tribes,
the
cherokee
tribe
in
particular,
they
said,
in
some
respects
they
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
federal
government
as
the
territory
did
in
its
second
grade
of
government
under
the
ordinance
of
1787.
such
territory
passed
its
own
laws
subject
to
the
approval
of
congress
and
its
inhabitants
were
subject
to
the
constitution
and
acts
of
congress.
the
principal
difference
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
cherokees
enact
their
own
laws
under
the
restriction
stated,
to
appoint
their
own
officers
and
pay
their
own
expenses.
this
however
is
no
reason
why
the
laws
and
the
proceeds
of
the
cherokee
territory
so
far
as
it
relates
to
rights
claimed
under
them
should
not
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
as
other
territories
in
the
union.
it
is
not
a
foreign,
but
a
domestic
territory,
a
territory
which
originated
under
our
constitution
and
laws.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
are
a
domestic
dependent
nation,
mr.
justice
marshall
as
defined
by
this
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
have
no
army,
that's
correct.
they
have
the
word
nation,
but
it
was
a
very
dependent
nation.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
even
said
that
their
lack
of
relationships
like
a
ward
to
a
guardian,
that's
how
much
of
a
nation
they
were.
now,
the
cherokee
patent
conveys
this
land,
covers
this
land
pursuant
to
the
survey,
pursuant
to
the
isaac
mccoy's
survey.
it
refers
to
the
description
in
the
survey.
the
patent
is
dated
december
31,
1838
and
found
at
appendix
nine
of
our
brief.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i've
been
unable
to
find
the
language
you're
talking
about.
let
me
read
where
it
reaches
that
point.
the
patent
as
i
say
which
is
found
in
appendix
nine
of
our
brief
getting
when
it
comes
down
to
the
canadian
river,
thence
down
to
the
canadian
river
on
it's
north
bank
to
it's
junction
with
the
arkansas
river.
excuse
me,
i'll
turn
to
that
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
perhaps
so,
i'm
not
sure.
any
out
of
patent
is
in
--
the
complete
patents
in
appendix
9.
the
complete
patent
is
in
appendix
nine
of
our
brief.
it's
also
on
page
53
of
our
brief.
alright,
and
we
get
to
this
point,
you
find
a
point
thence
down
the
canadian
river
on
its
north
bank,
“thence
down
of
the
canadian
river
to
its
north
bank
to
its
junction
with
the
arkansas
river,
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
arkansas
river
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
lands
of
the
choctaws
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river,
four
chains
and
54
lengths
east
of
fort
smith
thence
north
and
thence
north.”
now,
we
say
that's
a
reference
point.
we
say
the
word
“at”
means
in
the
vicinity
and
we
say
that
it's
simply
a
double
reference
for
the
surveyor's
accuracy
and
it
does
not
take
the
choctaw
bound
--
the
cherokee
boundary
to
the
south
bank
of
the
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
right,
opposite
north
corner,
at
the
corner
shown
by
the
field
notes
of
the
survey
and
so
that's
where
we
say
the
description
goes
and
by
the
way
that
is
the
only
reference
to
any
point
south
of
the
river
in
the
old
cherokee
patent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
have
not
included
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
may
have
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
may
have
read
them,
but
i
don't
have
them
freshly
in
mind
as
now.
but
we
say
this
is
contemporaneous.
the
contemporaneous
maps
with
field
notes
are
the
ones
that
are
legally
effective
in
this
situation,
in
this
case.
now,
that
is
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
he
may
have
been
given
those
instructions
but
the
land
are
previously
been
conveyed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
it
is
not
in
the
record.
we
say
that
now
we
have
another
argument
put
forward
by
appellants
to
which
i
should
give
some
note
here.
they
have
argued
that
because
there
were
provisions
in
the
treaties
that
at
no
time
would
the
lands
ceded
to
them
be
included
in
the
boundaries
--
within
the
boundaries
of
a
territory
or
state.
they
contended
that
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
any
holding
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
a
future
territory
or
state.
we
say
that
that
conclusion
is
erroneous
and
faulty.
we
say
that
the
cherokee
treaty
in
particular
says
without
their
consent
that
practically
implies
that
their
consent
could
be
sought
and
obtained
that
they
might
have
in
mind.
we
have
cited
congressional
reports
and
a
great
deal
of
other
data
which
shows
that
future
states
were
contemplated
in
this
area.
the
facts
are
that
the
lands
conveyed
to
them
were
not
included
in
a
future
territory
or
state
without
their
consent.
their
consent
was
obtained.
they
have
made
agreements
with
the
united
state
government
for
the
allotment
of
their
lands,
made
agreements
that
their
tribal
sovereignty
should
be
relinquished
in
favor
of
the
allottees,
made
agreements
that
the
laws
or
their
tribal
law
should
be
superseded
by
the
laws
of
arkansas.
they
were
admitted
to
citizenship
in
the
united
states
as
full
citizens.
they
put
themselves
and
were
put
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interior
department
as
to
all
of
their
tribal
affairs.
we
say
that
they
did
consent
to
become
a
part
of
the
future
state.
they
voted
on
the
admission
of
oklahoma
as
a
future
state
and
therefore
the
united
states
kept
faith
with
them
and
they
were
included
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
with
their
consent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
my
co-counsel
has
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white
that
i
may
have
overlooked,
you
were
referring
to
appendix
f
of
the
cherokee
brief.
the
report
of
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
john
d.c.
atkinson
–
atkins.
in
that
report
he
traces
the
various
surveys
that
were
made
and
comes
to
the
–
he
shows
that
three
earliest
surveyors,
either
fixed
the
corners
of
the
cherokees
or
choctaw
or
both
on
the
north
or
south
bank
of
the
river
respectively.
he
himself
later
surveyed,
the
ones
that
you
were
talking
about
were
seeking
to
relocate
the
old
survey
boundaries.
i
think
this
is
what
you
were
talking
about.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
--
those
have
never
been
researched
or
provided.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
is
my
time
up?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
thank
you
sir.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
friends,
the
cherokees
have
produced
a
convenient
map
which
i
think
will
be
helpful
in
following
to
the
argument
which
i
will
make
and
i
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
refer
to
that
map.
also,
you
might
find
it
helpful
to
refer
to
the
little
map
on
page
25
of
chapter
3.
now,
this
controversy
involves
the
bed
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
the
portion,
selected
by
the
cherokees
in
bringing
this
suit
in
1966
was
the
portion
commencing
at
the
arkansas
line
where
the
city
of
fort
smith
is
located
and
ending
where
the
grand
river
flows
into
the
arkansas.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
where
fort
gibson
is,
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
it
is
settled
that
the
arkansas
was
then
thought
to
be
navigable.
it
was
established
as
navigable.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i'm
not
--
we're
speaking
only
of
the
area
in
controversy.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
historical
evidence
is
that
there
are
a
few
miles
of
the
arkansas
and
a
few
miles
of
the
verdigris
that
are
navigable
and
were--
would
be
legally
sold
but
the
cherokees
didn't
choose
to
include
that
in
these
suits,
so
we
have
not
treated
it
in
the
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
it
is
now.
and
at
the
times
we're
talking
about,
the
times
these
treaties
were
made,
it
was
very
definitely
navigable.
the
stretch
of
the
river
is
a
meandering
stream,
as
you
see
it
from
that
map.
although
it
has
not
been
pertinent
in
this
case
and
no
evidence
has
been
introduced
on
it
and
our
engineer
estimates
that
there
are
a
little
over
a
100
miles
of
riverbed
in
this
stretch
of
the
river.
you
will
note
that
the
head
of
the
stretch,
fort
gibson
established
in
1824
and
at
the
foot
of
it,
fort
smith
on
which
the
first
military
establishment
appeared
in
1817.
this
area
has
been
substantially
used
in
commerce
during
this
decade
previous
to
the
time
of
the
signing
of
these
final
treaties
with
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws.
now,
let
us
keep
these
dates
in
mind.
the
first
treaty
that
the
eastern
cherokees
signed,
and
they
constituted
i
believe
about
four-fifths
of
the
entire
tribe,
was
in
1835.
all
treaties
previous
to
that
had
been
negotiated
with
the
western
cherokees,
who
then
i
believe
constituted
only
about
one-fifth
of
the
cherokee
members.
they
were
a
group
that
separate
from
the
rest
and
went
out
voluntarily
and
the
rest
didn't
want
to
negotiate
over
many
years
and
finally
arrived
in
the
agreement
in
1835.
now,
the
final
choctaw
treaty,
the
one
on
which
superseded
all
previous
treaties
and
the
one
upon
which
the
choctaw
claims
under
patent
is
based
was
executed
in
1830.
so,
in
this
decade
previous
to
that,
this
stretch
of
the
grand
river,
the
arkansas
river
up
to
the
grand
was
established
as
a
useful
artery
of
commerce.
the
trial
court
examined
into
the
available
facts
carefully
and
reached
a
very
definite
conclusion
on
that
subject.
the
trial
court
said,
“it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
court
as
to
this
issue
that
it
was
common
knowledge
in
the
legal
sense
from
at
least
as
early
as
1824
until
sometime
after
november
16,
1907,
the
day
of
oklahoma
state.
the
arkansas
river
in
its
natural
state
was
a
navigable
river
to
below
in
its
confluence
with
the
grand
river
regularly
used
throughout
the
remainder
of
its
course
in
what
is
now
oklahoma
as
a
highway
of
commerce
during
the
major
portion
of
each
year.
accordingly,
it
is
the
decision
of
this
court
based
upon
judicial
knowledge
alone
and
without
taking
the
evidence
that
this
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
was
never
navigable,
in
fact
and
in
law
at
the
time
the
western
domains
now
a
part
of
oklahoma
were
ceded
to
the
choctaw
nation
and
to
the
cherokee
nation
and
at
that
the
time
the
treaties
were
made
pursuant
to
which
the
lands
were
ceded,
and
also
at
the
time
when
oklahoma
was
admitted
to
statehood
november
16,
1907.
history
records
substantial
riverbed
navigation
along
that
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
but
during
this
period
there
were
regularly
scheduled
trips
at
the
ports
of
fort
gibson
and
at
the
ports,
free
ports
just
above
fort
gibson.
in
1833,
17
boats
regularly
docked
at
fort
gibson.
there
were
22
established
landings
between
fort
smith
and
fort
gibson
and
including
redland,
sallisaw,
webbers
falls
and
vian.
it
actually
was
the
only
method
by
which
substantial
commerce
could
come
into
this
area
and
as
a
result
of
this
navigable
water,
this
part
of
oklahoma
became
to
be
the
first
port
that
had
any
substantial
settlements
made
in
it.
it
was
a
vital
link
between
fort
smith
and
fort
gibson
and
the
bottleneck
between
fort
gibson
and
the
outside
world.
history
is
complete
with
the
records
of
substantial
stores
for
the
army
post,
recruits
being
brought
in
a
great
many
of
the
indians
who
later
came
in
under
this
treaties
were
brought
up
this
river
in
boats
and
steam
boats.
they
device
the
shallow
draft
steamboat
which
could
negotiate
this
river
very
well
in
the
major
portions
of
each
year
and
so
there
is
no
question
that
this
was
an
established
navigable
body
of
water
before
these
treaties
were
made.
it
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court
and
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
case
that
i
know
of.
the
ownership
of
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
and
i
should
say
that
the
arkansas
river
is
a
second
longest
tributary
of
the
mississippi,
the
longest
being
the
missouri.
the
negotiators
that
appear
into
the
louisiana
treaty
were
quite
cognizant
of
the
necessity
of
securing
all
these
waters
because
of
navigation
and
many
other
reasons.
in
a
later
date
of
may
13,
1803
from
robert
livingston
and
james
monroe
to
james
madison,
the
secretary
of
the
state,
the
writer
set
the
question
of
a
full
control
on
use
of
the
mississippi
river
and
all
streams

mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
state
of
oklahoma
sir.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
just
the
state
of
oklahoma,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
black
i
am
representing
actually
all
of
the
respondents
which
include
the
state
of
oklahoma's
lessees
also
its
oil
and
gas
lessees
and
its
sand
and
gravel
lessees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
leased
these
lands.
in
fact
it
has
been
leasing
them
since
about
1908.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
with
the
cherokee
tribe
or
the
choctaw
tribe
until
this
last
lease
was
instituted
in
1966.
the
state
of
oklahoma
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
nearly
60
years.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
oil
developed
thereon.
mr.
claiborne
i
believe
was
mistaken
on
that
subject
sure
he
was
in
good
faith
there
is
some
gas
production.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is
because
of
the
gas.
they
have
all
gas
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
there
is
some
gas
production
on
some
of
the
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
a
quite
recent,
just
in
the
last
three
or
four
years,
i
would
think.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
this
controversy
is
between
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
the
cherokee
tribe
and
the
choctaw
tribe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
standard
values
of
land
should,
could
i
say
this
mr.
justice
black.
the
values
of
the
land
involved
far
exceed
the
value
of
the
minerals
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
no
other
claimant
to
the
lands
other
than
the
state.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
controversy,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
no
controversy
between
the
state
and
the
oil
and
gas
lessees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
there
is
not.
the
other
gas
lessees
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
because
they
hold
oil
and
gas
leases
from
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
from
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
from
the
indians,
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
not
if
the
state
of
oklahoma
prevails
they
have
good
leases.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
if
the
state
of
oklahoma
does
not
prevail
then
they
would
have
to
make
their
piece
with
whichever
of
the
indian
tribes
does
prevail.
as
stated
yesterday
by
mr.
kile,
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
choctaws
and
the
cherokees?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
know
of
none
and
i've
not
heard
of
any.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
in
oklahoma
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes
the
value
is
not,
no.
and
the
oil
and
gas
development
actually
is
not
either
but
these
are
undisputable
facts.
the
law
is
and
we
have
set
it
forth
on
our
briefs
that
the
state
claims
the
riverbed
between
high
watermarks
and
that
was
established
years
ago
in
the
law
of
oklahoma
as
being
the
states
the
extent
of
the
states
claim
to
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
there
the
stream
is
being
stabilized
and
in
some
places
straightened
by
the
united
states
army
engineers
in
this
navigation,
arkansas
river
navigation
project
that
is
going
up
there.
at
least
a
considerable
amount
of
area
formerly
covered
by
waters
are
better
and
mr.
kile
mentioned
that
in
the
talking
about
in
the
evasive
bed
and
i
believe
that
is
what
he
intend
to
say.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
black
perhaps
that
could
be
assumed
but
it
is
not
a
fact.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
oil
companies
are
seeking
to
protect
their
respective
leases.
some
of
the
companies
have
only
one
lease
on
maybe
very
limited
area
of
riverbed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
some
of
the
oil
companies
do
have
only
one
lease
on
a
very
limited
area
of
riverbed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
i
say
one
you
may
find
one
company
that
will
have
only
one
lease
on
one
say
320-acre
track
which
then
composes
a
part
of
the
riverbed
but
we
have
a
100
miles
of
riverbed
here
to
consider.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
am
representing
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
its
lessees,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
its
lessees
are
the
oil
companies
and
the
sand
and
gravel
companies
that
are
parties
to
this
litigation.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'm
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
there
is
a
representation
of
title
yes.
i'm
certain.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
am
not
sure
of
the
amount,
what
is
the
1/8.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
few
of
them
are.
it
has
not
been
out
and
said
there
was
no
oil,
there
is
some
gas
and
there
has
been
rather
difficulty.
it
looked
a
lot
better
when
the
suit
started
and
it
does
now.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
indians
brought
to
suit
in
december
1966,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
the
first
suit
that
the
indians
have
brought
here
on
challenging
this
and
oklahoma
has
exerted
dominion
control
over
these
river
for
60
years
prior
to
that.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes
we
did,
we
exclude
many
all
gas
leases
and
sand
and
gravel
leases
to
this
market
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
past
three
or
four
years,
there
has
been
a
discovery
of
gas,
a
gas
field
over
in
this
area.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
that
got
them
interested
and
apparently
they
decided
to
file
their
suit
then.
they
stood
by
for
60
years
without
filing
any
suit
or
bringing
the
question
to
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
riverbed
and
composites
within
high
watermarks
are
great
deal
of
land
and
the
land
values
are
very
substantial.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
agriculture.
these
river
bottom
lands
that
--
where
the
river
is
now
being
controlled
through
the
navigation
project
are
very
valuable
lands.
they
can
be
smooth
over
with
a
bulldozer
and
put
on
production
some
of
it
has
high
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
that's
the
real
value
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
of
course,
the
gas
production
is
something
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
probably
yes,
probably
the
new
navigation
channel
makes
certain
areas
along
with
the
river
bed
valuable
for
sites
for
industrial
plans
or
any
number
of
things
but
the
navigation
project
plus
the
gas
development
somewhat
in
different
success
probably
have
something
to
do
with
the
indians
deciding
in
1966
to
file
their
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
actually
we
have
never
ascertained
it.
it's
a
very
difficult
civil
engineering
job.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
will
be.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is.
now,
mr.
kile
in
his
argument
yesterday,
referred
to
our
preliminary
statement
in
our
brief
and
states
that
he
accepts
the
challenge
in
that
statement.
that's
at
page
9
and
if
the
court
cares
to
refer
to
it
again
and
he
read
what
we
stated
and
i'm
going
to
read
it
again
because
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
on
this
point.
page
9
directly
under
preliminary
statement,
the
question
to
be
resolved
is
simple
and
direct.
did
the
united
states
convey
or
agreed
to
convey
the
riverbed
to
the
cherokees
or
choctaws?
the
answer
is
no.
not
by
the
standards
this
court
has
established
for
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
or
even
by
the
accepted
standards
of
ordinary
conveyancing
in
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below,
there
was
no
ambiguity
on
this
subject
and
each
of
them
concluded
that
the
treaties
and
patents
did
not
provide
for
a
conveyance
of
the
bed
of
the
river.
petitioners
not
having
met
to
burden
of
showing
inclusion
of
the
riverbed
under
their
treaties
or
patents
have
sought
to
shift
the
burden
by
arguing
that
the
state
must
show
that
the
united
states
reserved
the
riverbed
when
it
made
the
treaties
and
patents.
since
the
united
states
did
not
convey
the
riverbed,
there
was
no
need
to
reserve
it.
we
say
that
the
riverbed
was
not
conveyed
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
us
in
that.
now,
let
us
refer
to
the
language
of
the
treaties
and
the
patents
because
there
is
where
the
languages
upon
which
the
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws
or
the
cherokees
must
stand
or
fall.
in
the
treaty
of
october
18,
1820
with
the
chocktaws,
the
treaty
called
the
treaty
of
doak's
stand.
the
lands
ceded
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
whole
lengthy
description
but
just
to
part
only
part
that
refers
to
the
arkansas.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
this
is
not
in,
this
is
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
this
is
page
56.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
56
of
our
brief
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
tract
--
a
treaty
october
18,
1820
doak's
stand,
a
tract
of
country
and
i
haven't
included
all
of
this
and
i
am
not
going
to
read
all
that
might
be
the
descriptions.
a
tribe
and
only
the
parts
referring
to
the
arkansas
river,
a
track
of
country
west
of
the
mississippi
river
situate
between
the
arkansas
and
red
river
and
bounded
as
follows,
beginning
on
the
arkansas
where
the
lower
boundary
line
on
the
cherokees
strike
the
sand,
that's
up
the
arkansas
to
the
canadian
fork
and
up
the
same
that
source
and
so
forth
that
is
all
of
the
set
about
the
arkansas
river
just
dense
up
the
arkansas
and
that
treaty
but
they
do
make
it
quite
clear
it's
a
vast
track
of
land
that
lies
between
the
arkansas
and
the
red
river.
now,
if
you'll
look
at
that
little
map
on
page
25
of
the
choctaw
brief,
you'll
find
an
oversimplified
but
somewhat
helpful
map
which
shows
where
that
boundary
goes.
they
have
a
vast
track
there
between
the
arkansas
and
the
red
river
and
that's
what
the
government
agreed
to
convey
it
to
them.
now,
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they're
really
locating
that
because
of
the
arkansas
state
boundary.
the
cherokee
southeastern
corner
was
located
by
the
surveyor
isaac
mccoy
who
on
whose
basis
who's
surveying
the
cherokee
pattern
was
wrong.
on
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas
and
he
located
the
northeastern
boundary
of
the
choctaws
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas.
now,
let
us
take
this
treaty,
final
treaty
between
the
choctaws
and
the
united
states
in
which
all
the
previous
treaty
was
superceded
and
merged
you
might
say,
that's
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
creek,
september
13,
1830.
you
will
find
that
on
page
also
a
reference
to
that
at
page
59,
i
believe
of
our
briefs,
56
of
our
brief,
yes.
now,
the
beginning
near
fort
smith
where
the
arkansas
boundary
crosses
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
the
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
now,
that
is
the
only
margin
of
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
the
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
that's
all
as
said
about
the
arkansas
river
in
that
treaty
and
that's
the
final
treaty.
now,
their
patent,
their
patent
is
shown
--
the
choctaw's
didn't
set
up
their
patent
in
their
brief,
so
we
had
to
set
it
out
and
it's
shown
on
page,
appendix
5
of
our
brief,
patent
issued
to
the
choctaws.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
it
is
a
roman
numeral
xi
and
appendix
v.
patent
to
the
choctaws
dated
march
23,
1842.
i
won't
read
all
of
that
i
will
read
just
a
part
that
mentions
the
arkansas
river.
that
however
is
before
the
court
and
if
you
want
to
read
everything
that's
said,
it's
there.
the
united
states
under
grant
especially
to
be
made
by
the
press
of
the

and
they
were
citing
the
previous
treaty
the
year
1933.
the
united
states
under

special
to
be
made
by
the
president
of

beginning
near
fort
smith
where
the
arkansas
boundaries
strike
the
arkansas
river
running
dense
to
source
of
the
canadian
fork.
if
you
are
in
the
limits
of
the
united
states
or
to
those
limits
hence
due
south
to
the
red
river
down
the
red
river
to
the
west
boundary
of
the
territory
of
arkansas.
thence,
north
along
the
line
to
the
beginning,
now
that
is
the
description.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct
the
red
river
is
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
correct
but
the
rule
is
different
on
a
navigable
stream
from
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
that's
correct
it
seems
clear
to
consider
there.
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
is
our
position
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
state
upon
obtaining
statehood
acquires
the
bed
of
the
navigable
streams
and
that
united
states
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
future
states
to
be
formed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
state
does
not
own
any
non-navigable
streams.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
riparian
owners,
i
believe
on
the
south
side,
i
believe
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
as
riparian
owners
on
the
north
side
i
understand
that
they
claim
own
to
the
middle.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
treaty
didn't
say
that
the
treaty
said
that
the
lands
ceded
to
the
choctaws
shall
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
limits
of
the
future
territory
or
state
and
the
treaty
with
the
cherokees,
i
said
the
lands
ceded
to
the
cherokees
shall
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
limits
of
a
future
territory
or
state
without
their
consent.
we
think
that
getting
the
consent
of
the
choctaws
could
be
implied,
i
mean
they
could
always
consent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
they
didn't
consent.
no,
i
will
tell
you
that
there
were
later
treaties
in
which
i
did
consent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they
have
to
be
expressly
included,
yes.
they
have
to
expressly
included.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
my
throat
is
getting
a
little
hoarse
and
i'd
like
to
water
if
i
might
please.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
there
is
no
mentioned
of
navigability.
now,
with
respect
to
the
cherokee
treaties
and
patents,
we
have
and
if
you
wish
to
follow
it
in
page
50
in
reference
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
page
50
of
our
brief.
the
reference
is
to
the
reference
in
the
cherokee
treaty
of
may
6,
1828.
the
only
reference
to
the
arkansas
river
is
to
the
main
branch
of
the
arkansas
river
to
its
junction
with
the
canadian
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
on
page
50.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
of
our
brief.
yes
under
article
2.
the
complete
description
is
given
there.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
only
part
that
where
arkansas
river
is
mentioned
is
to
the
main
branch
of
the
arkansas
river
thence
down
said
river
to
its
junction
with
the
canadian
river.
now,
on
that
treaty
the
area
of
between
fort
smith
and
the
confluence
with
the
canadian
was
entirely
left
open,
it
wasn't
even
mentioned.
now,
that
was
a
treaty
with
the
western
cherokees.
we
have
maps
in
back
of
our
brief
that
shows
it.
now,
the
treaty
of
february
13,
1833.
now,
that
maybe
found
on
the
description
on
page
51
and
omitting
the
previous
language
and
going
only
to
where
it
mentions
the
arkansas
thence
down,
let's
see,
down
the
old
western
territory
line
of
arkansas
territory
to
the
verdigris
and
down
into
few
miles
and
i
know
this
first
mentioned
the
arkansas,
to
the
arkansas.
thence
down
the
arkansas,
as
you
can
see
is
just
a
few
miles
there
to
a
point,
thence
down
the
canadian
to
the
arkansas,
thence
down
the
arkansas
to
the
point
of
the
arkansas
where
the
eastern
choctaw
boundary
strikes
the
said
river.
now,
the
patent
is
the
new
echota
treaty,
the
one
which
the
eastern
cherokees
joined.
december
29,
1835
the
patent
is
shown
in
full
in
our
appendix
9,
back
to
the
cherokees.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
29
in
a
roman
numeral
page.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
they
haven't
been
very
specific
about
that,
mr.
justice
black,
but
apparently
they
invoke
all
these
treaties.
apparently,
i
hope
to
find
an
inclusion
somewhere.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
apparently,
that
is
their
contention.
now,
the
only
place
here
in
the
patent
where
the
arkansas
river
is
mentioned
is
where
it
says,
in
the
patent
on
page
30
top
of
page.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
in
my
notes,
i
apologize.
in
my
notes,
i'll
try
to
leave
out
anything
that
didn't
expressly
refer
to
the
arkansas.
well,
anyhow,
this
is
taken
from
this
treaty,
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas
river
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
now,
that's
only
reference
to
the
arkansas
river
there
except
the
reference
above
to
the
junction
with
the
arkansas
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
right.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
subject.
now,
that
is
found
in
the
appendix,
the
general
appendix
at
page
144a,
144a
of
the
appendix,
the
first
grammatical
paragraph.
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
question
on
that
yesterday
which
i
believe
was
not
answered
correctly.
i
call
attention
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
indians
seek
comfort
from
the
technical
language
of
the
treaties
and
grants.
they
attach
significance
to
such
phrases
as
to
the
arkansas
river.
down
the
arkansas
and
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas.
we
agree
with
oklahoma
that
references
to
the
arkansas
river
are
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
reference
points,
monuments
or
boundaries.
they
do
not
indicate
an
intent
much
less
a
clear
intent
to
convey
the
riverbed.”
now,
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
passing
on
these
treaties
and
patents
that
i
have
gratefully
referred
to
you.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
say
that
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
as
to
that,
that's
about
40%,
i
would
say
of
this
riverbed,
about
60%
lies
below
the
junction
where
the
canadian,
about
40%
has
the
cherokee
lands
on
both
sides.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
true
but
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct,
that
is
to
that
stretch
of
it.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
our
answer
to
that
is
that
there
was
no
clear
indefinite
specific
description
of
the
riverbed
in
the
treaties
or
the
patents
referring
to
that
portion
or
any
portion
of
the
arkansas
riverbed.
that
under
the
authorities
set
forth
in
the
decisions
starting
back
with
martin
versus
waddell,
pollard
versus
hagan,
shively
versus
bowlby,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
are
held
by
these
that
were
not
under
the
constitution
conveyed
to
or
relinquished
to
the
federal
government.
the
13
regional
counties
got
the
origin
of
the
waterbeds
of
the
navigable
waters.
the
states
then
submitted
were
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right
so
they
had
administration
over
them
and
they
would
only
the
policy
of
congress
as
set
forth
exhaustibly
in
shively
versus
bowlby.
it
expresses
the
fact
that
those
--
the
navigable
waters
are
never,
have
not
been
conveyed
away
except
under
exceptional
circumstance.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
under
certain
circumstances.
these
circumstances
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
shively
versus
bowlby.
in
order
to
perform
international
obligations,
to
effect
the
improvement
of
such
lands
or
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
with
four
missions
and
among
the
several
states
or
to
carryout
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
now,
a
counsel
for
cherokee
is
and
chocktaws
have
argued
that
they
come
within
the
last
exception,
you
might
say
to
the
general
rule.
we
say
they
do
not.
there
was
no
reason
for
--
they're
an
agricultural
people,
they
didn't
make
their
living
by
fishing,
they
didn't
make
their
living
by
commerce.
there
was
no
purpose
in
conveying
a
highway
of
commerce
already
established
to
them
in
the
treaties
with
them,
and
that
therefore
this
purpose
would
not
have
been
carried
out
in
conveying
to
them.
furthermore,
of
course,
we
say
they
were
not
conveyed
to
them
under
the
rule
of
holt
state
bank,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
correct.
they
have
done
a
few
cases
over
on
the
west
coast
where
small
water
covered
area
was
conveyed.
certain
indians
at
the
end
of
the
reservation
where
they
made
their
living
by
fishing
and
it
was
held
at
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
that
is
right.
well,
there
is
nothing
like
it.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
now
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
think
what
they
gave
them
was
what
those
conveyed
to
them.
now,
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
they
gave
up.
in
this
case,
what
they
got
was
what
was
conveyed
to
them.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
were
conveyed
the
property
in
fee
simple
subject
to
certain
very
important.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
had
fee
simple
except
that
they
are
the
patents
to
them
provided
that
the
choctaw
patent
provided
that
the
lands
hereby
granted
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
of
the
cherokee
nation
ceases
and
abandons
the
same
as
the
cherokee
patent,
excuse
me.
the
choctaw
patent
provides
that
the
land
shall
inure
to
them
as
long
as
they
shall
exist
as
a
nation
and
live
on
it.
occupancy
is
required.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
under
the
language
i
have
just
--
with
the
qualification
i
have
just
read.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
have
because
it
was
a
navigable
river
bottom
because
it
comes
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
river
is
navigable
and
the
bottom
follows
the
navigation
rights
established
by
the
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
one
we're
talking
about
mr.
justice
marshall
is,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
that
is
land
between
the
high
watermarks
previously
established
by
the
river
before
stabilization
by
the
united
states
army
engineers,
which
creates
an
artificial
evulsive
change.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
our
position.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it
has
been
--
the
state
has
collected
a
revenue
over
from
this
riverbed
from
sand
and
gravel
and
oil
and
gas
leases
for
60
years.
it
has
been
of
value
to
the
state.
it
has
gotten
more
valuable
lately.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
did
not,
not
until
the
suit
was
filed
in
december
1966.
now,
the
holt
state
bank
rule,
in
that
case,
there
are
certain
reservations
were
established
for
the
chippewa
indian
tribes.
under
certain
treaties
made
prior
to
minnesota
statehood.
these
treaties
expressly
described
certain
land
as
being
reserved
for
these
indians.
they
do
create
a
reservation
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
have
argued.
the
statute
shows
it.
now,
in
the
red
lake
or
indian
reservation
were
then
the
boundaries
of
that
reservation
was
a
lake
called
mud
lake
that
the,
in
1889
of
the
treaties
last
treaties
were
1855
prior
to
minnesota
statehood,
state
being
admitted
in
1858,
i
believe.
the
treaty
of
1855
included
just
mud
lake.
in
1889,
the
government
made
a
further
treaty
with
the
indians
in
which
the
red
lake
reservation
was
to
be
ceded
by
two
of
the
government
and
was
ceded
back
to
the
government.
the
government
was
then
going
to
divide
the
land
into
tracks
and
sell
it
off
and
deposit
the
money
in
a
trust
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewa's.
a
number
of
tracks
were
sold
to
settlers
by
the
government
and
patents
issued
to
the
purchasers
along
the
shores
of
mud
lake.
later
on,
the
government
developed
a
project
to
drain
mud
lake
and
that
lay
bearer
certain
valuable
agricultural
land
between
riparian
lines
of
the
settlers
who
have
bought
from
the
government
and
the
water
placed
to
where
the
water
had
receded
and
they
claimed
as
riparian
proprietors
under
the
minnesota
law.
the
federal
government
suit
on
behalf
of
the
chippewa's
contending
that
this
lake
was
not
a
navigable
lake.
and
not
being
a
navigable
lake
that
when
it
was
drained,
when
the
water
was
drained
away
the
land
lake
bearer
did
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
riparian
proprietors
but
they
claimed
that
did
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
chippewa's.
it
was
within
red
lake
reservation
boundaries
and
there
is
no
question
to
that.
the
court
held
in
substance
that
in
the
treaties
with
the
chippewa's,
which
did
express
to
encompass
this
area
within
the
boundaries.
the
united
states
did
not
expressly
and
distinctly
convey
the
navigable
water
bottoms.
the
court
first
held
by
the
way
that
the
lands,
the
bottoms
were
navigable
contrary
to
united
states
that
mud
lake
was
navigable,
contrary
to
the
contention
of
the
united
states.
and
accordingly,
the
court
held
since,
there
was
no
specific
description
of
this
land
encompassed
all
around
by
the
reservation
boundaries.
but
there
could
not
be
inferred
any
intention
to
convey
the
navigable
water
bottoms
in
view
of
the
long
established
policy
of
this
country
to
hold
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
in
trust
for
future
states.
now,
that
in
substance
is
the
holding
in
the
holt
state
bank
and
we
think
it's
the
holding
under
which
the
part
of
the
arkansas
river
that
has
cherokee
land
in
both
sides
should
continue
to
be
owned
and
held
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
now,
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
other
side
seems
to
be
based
principally
on
the
agreement
in
the
cherokee
treaty
that
the
land
ceded
to
them
should
not
at
any
future
time
be
embraced
within
the
boundaries
of
a
future
state
without
their
consent,
remember
that,
without
their
consent.
the
choctaw
treaty
says,
the
lands
ceded
to
them
should
at
no
time
be
included
within
the
boundaries
of
a
future
territory
or
state.
now
in
1893,
by
act
of
congress
of
march
3,
1893,
27
stat.
645,
congress
created
a
commission
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
other
tribes
to
relinquish
tribal
rights
and
to
accept
allotment
of
their
lands
in
severalty
to
tribal
members
where
the
ultimate
object
of
including
said
lands
in
a
state.
the
result
of
this
act
and
ensuing
acts
of
congress
were
agreements
with
the
cherokees
32
stat.
716
and
with
the
choctaws
30
stat.
495,
and
42
stat.
641
in
1902,
which
provided
for
the
allotment
of
the
lands
to
individual
members
of
the
respective
tribes
and
relinquishment
of
the
general
powers
of
the
tribal
governments.
these
agreements
were
followed
by
the
act
of
april
28,
1904,
33
stat.
573,
which
supplemented
the
tribal
laws
and
put
the
laws
of
arkansas
in
effect
in
indian
territory.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
that
is
correct.
well,
the
now
in
1901
an
act
of
congress
was
passed
making
all
members
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
including
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
chickasaws
making
them
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
act
of
april
26,
1906,
continuing
tribal
governments
for
limited
purposes
ending
termination
of
some
future
state
and
for
regulation
of
tribal
affairs
under
the
interior
department.
the
interior
department
was
given
complete
and
comprehensive
regulation
over
the
tribes.
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
became
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
these
congressional
acts.
as
citizens
of
the
territory,
they
voted
with
other
citizens
in
the
elections
concerned
with
the
admission
of
oklahoma
to
the
union
and
oklahoma
was
admitted
on
november
16,
1907.
now,
the
tribes
continued
to
exist
in
a
sort
of
a
de
jure
form.
they
have
practically
for
everything.
there
is
very
little
that
their
tribal
governments
have
to
decide.
they
have
no
legislative
powers.
they
have
very
limited
administrative
powers.
everything
they
do
has
to
be
proved
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
w.f.
semple,
counsel
for
choctaws
for
many
years
later
on
their
principal
chief,
in
a
text
book
written
by
him
on
oklahoma
indian
land
titles
said,
“the
act
of
congress
of
april
26,
1906
in
continuum
of
the
tribal
governments
also
provided
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
could
remove
the
tribal
chiefs
or
appoint
one
in
case
of
death
or
removal.”
all
the
five
civilized
tribes
have
a
chief
or
governor
although
in
the
cherokee
and
seminole
nations
there
are
very
few
unsold
common
properties.
the
duties
principally
are
to
sign
deeds
to
the
remaining
lands
and
employ
attorneys
to
handle
claims
against
the
government.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
upon
oklahoma
statehood,
november
16,
1908,
i
mean
1906,
sorry.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
senator.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
senator
owens
is
elected
first
election.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
it
is
not
in
the
brief.
we
didn't
know
that
matter
is
going
to
the
combination
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
house
report
number
2503
82nd
congress,
2nd
session.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
dated
december
15,
1952.
the
only
thing
i
want
to
read
from
you
was
that
is
this
statement,
“there
are
no
reservations
for
cherokees
or
choctaws
or
chickasaws
in
oklahoma.”
now
i
have
another
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
reservations,
their
lands
were
allotted
in
severalty.
there
are
citizens.
they
live
in
a
community
like
everybody
else
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
of
course,
actually
i
think
the
rest
of
the
nation,
those
has
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
cherokee
versus
georgia
when
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
stated
that
the
cherokees
were
not
a
nation,
so
that
could
bring
an
action
in
the
united
states
courts
and
he
at
that
time
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
nothing,
nothing.
they
are
certainly
tribes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
don't
question
their
right
to
maintain
the
suit.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
the
question,
the
court
was,
was
interested
in
that
question
that
we
simply
supply
the
information.
i
don't
think
this
particular
material
except
that
there
are
civilized
members
of
the
community.
now,
the
question
was
asked
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
they
are.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
you
can't
tell
when
you're
talking
to
a
cherokee
or
a
choctaw
in
oklahoma.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
have
done
the
rest
with
them
all
my
life
and
i
never
know
when
my
member
is
a
cherokee
or
choctaw
or
what
he
might
be
so
they
are
mixed
with
whites
so
much.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
they
are
completely
immense
in
the
community
of
oklahoma.
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us.
in
fact,
one
of
my
co-counsel
mr.
groom
is
part
cherokee,
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
a
cherokee
indian.
now,
on
the
question
of
schooling,
we
have
a
1952
report.
we
have
here
this
is
house
report
number
2503
union
calendar
790,
82nd
congress
second
session.
a
report
and
it
seems
to
be
the
last
one
that
has
been
made.
on
the
agency
area
statistics
on
indian
education,
on
the
data
here
that
i'm
going
to
read
are
data
on
indian
children
ages
6
to
18
inclusive
having
one-fourth
degree
or
more
indian
blood
and
cover
fiscal
year
in
1952.
now,
five
civilized
tribes
there
is
nothing
separate
all
the
way
through
on
separate
tribes
here.
they
lumped
the
five
civilized
tribes
together,
cherokees,
choctaws,
chickasaws,
seminoles
and
creeks.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
and
creeks.
children
attending
public
schools
perhaps
of
last
tribes,
13,894,
children
attending
government
schools,
1,864
roughly
90%
are
attending
public
schools
and
the
others
schools
they
attend
are
government
schools.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
fortunately,
we
don't
make
--
they
have
to
make
that
contention.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
if
a
sufficient
--
if
there
were
sufficient
evidence
for
it
i
don't
think
congress
is
powerless
to
deal
with
the
lands
of
navigable
waters.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
question
that
exercise
of
power,
mr.
justice
white.
fortunately,
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
i
would
question
that
exercise
of
power.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
believe
it
says
at
the
south
side
of
the
river,
isn't
that
correct,
which
is
different.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
said
that
in
our
brief
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
do.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
the
field
notes
are
evidence,
i
would
say
and
in
this
case
they
are
evidence.
we
are
not
saying
this
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
sir,
we
don't
contend
these
field
notes
override
(voice
overlap).
we're
just
saying
they're
evidence.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
said,
we
said
it
would
be
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river.
that
is
a
boundary.
the
arkansas
river
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
cherokees,
no
the
cherokee
is
on
the
north.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
is
merely
for
the
purpose
of
locating
where
that
end
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
contend
that
as
merely
a
location.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
we
contend
that
as
merely
a
location
point
under
the
evidence
of
the
field
notes
is
pertinent
on
the
subject.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
we
don't
exactly
say
that,
we
say
no
that's
merely
a
location.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
a
reference.
it
is
a
location
for
the
lower
end
of
this
land.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
issue
is
whether
the
entire
bed
of
the
river
is
included
and
if
there
is
clear
and
definite
language
that
would
justify
and
warrant
the
inclusion
of
this
entire
bed
of
this
river.
we
say
there
is
no
such
language.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
word
“at”
if
you
note
the
footnote.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
all
right
“at”
that
point,
and
“at”
does
not
mean
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
no,
that
means
the
vicinity.
we
have
given
a
definition
of
that
in
the
note
there,
the
note
in
the
brief.
it
is
our
contention
to
review
that
this
has
establish
a
navigable
water
years
prior
to
the
time
of
these
treaties
and
patents
that
when
the
treaties
and
patents
were
made,
there
was
no
description
of
the
riverbed
that
would
constitute
a
conveyance
of
the
riverbed.
we
contend
that
the
provisions
and
the
treaties
to
the
effect
that
no
future
state,
the
lands
ceded
would
never
be
included
in
any
future
territory
or
state,
simply
meant
did
not
forever
renounce
the
possibility
of
this
land
ever
becoming
a
part
of
a
future
state
or
territory.
that
the
government
did
not
violate
its
covenant
with
the
indians,
that
it
sought
their
consent,
that
it
got
their
consent,
that
they
agreed
to
the
inclusion
in
a
future
territory
or
state
and
that
the
government
has
kept
faith
with
them
and
that
the
base
of
their
entire
argument
falls.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
have
--
we
do
not
have
a
record
exactly
of
that.
of
course,
we
have
called
the
court's
attention
to
a
ruling
by
the
interior
department
of
1908
to
the
effect
that
the
cherokees
do
not
own
this
land.
it
was
submitted
to
them
and
this
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
the
lowry
record
company
made
a
request
or
a
lease
from
the
interior
department.
a
letter
was
written
as
an
opinion
by
the
acting
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
this
letter
was
written
in
response
to
an
application
made
by
the
lowry
record
company
to
interior
department
for
permission
to
enter
into
a
contract
to
take
sand
and
gravel
from
the
arkansas
river.
in
denying
jurisdiction
in
the
matter,
the
acting
commissioner
said
after
citing
authorities
among
them
shively
versus
bowlby.
in
other
words,
when
the
united
states
conveyed
by
warranty
deed
the
lands
occupied
by
the
cherokees,
creeks,
choctaws,
chickasaws,
and
seminoles,
it
did
not
convey
the
ownership
of
a
beds
of
navigable
streams
but
reserve
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
state
within
whose
boundaries
they
would
fall.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
march
27,
1908
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
that
has
remained
unchallenged
by
either
cherokees
or
choctaws
for
60
almost
60
years.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
now
we
have
records
in
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
of
cases
from
1913
to
1940.
i
can
give
you
citations
of
those.
united
states
works
also
in
the
federal
courts.
so,
united

versus

1913,
state
versus
nolegs
139-943
1914,

versus
united
states,
1922,
a
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
all
show
the
exercise
of
dominion
over
the
riverbed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
the
official
court
reports.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
very
well,
thank
you,
i
will
do
so.
so,
we
have
a
ruling
by
the
interior
department
on
the
subject.
we
have
these
successive
assertions
of
title
by
the
state
evidenced
that
in
these
various
decisions
i
have
cited.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
we
have
that
but
as
stated
today.
that's
correct.
they
differ
from
their
previous
position.
at
least
the
department
of
justice
does.
now,
there
is
one
thing
mr.
kile
has
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
should
be
controversy
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
indians.
there
would
have
to
--
there
would
be
a
controversy
between
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws.
in
the
trial
court
and
also
appearing
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
had
a
representative
of
certain
of
riparian
land
owners.
who
if
the
indians
should
become
victorious
on
the
tribe
under
whom
they
claim,
they
are
the
present
grantees
of
the
allottees
of
the
riparian
land
from
the
choctaws.
they
undoubtedly
will
and
their
interest
in
this
case
was
that
they
would
seek
to
recover
the
riverbed
from
the
choctaws
as
riparian
proprietors
and
those
questions
all
would
remain
to
be
settled
also.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
correct.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
the
records
--
the
records
show
that
there
were
it
is
unchallenged.
we've
made
the
assertion
in
our
brief
and
there's
some
challenge
but
we
can
produce
the
records
if
you
would
like.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
if
there
would
be
i
believe
war
department
instructed
mr.
the
secretary
of
war
instructed
mr.
isaac
mccoy
to
make
this
survey.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
stated
to
me
the
purpose
on
making
the
survey.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
the
patent
was
granted
after
the
survey.
they
--
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
has
lapsed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
are
there
any
more
questions
you
like
to
be
asked?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
black
and
may
i
please
the
court.
we
have
enlarged
certain
map
appendices
from
our
brief
and
we
would
like
to
have
them
distributed
to
the
court.
we
think
it
would
be
easier
for
you
to
read
after
we
have
reduced
them
to
the
point
where
we
could
print
them
in
our
brief.
we
found
that
they
were
rather
difficult
to
read
and
we
think
this
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
they
were
to
be
considered.
the
first
one,
the
large
map
here
is
attached
to
our
brief
as
appendix
three.
we
have
completed
that
and
attached
it
on
the
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
in
the
brief
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that
is
the
map
prepared
by
isaac
mccoy
from
which
the
cherokee
patent
was
prepared.
it
is
a
map
of
the
surveys
under
the
direction
of
isaac
mccoy.
the
other
enlargement
is
the
enlargement
of
our
appendix
four
from
our
brief.
this
enlargement
is
an
enlargement
of
the
copy
of
the
field
notes
of
the
surveyor
donaldson
who
did
this
surveying
under
the
direction
of
isaac
mccoy.
these
we
think
will
be
helpful
to
the
court
in
locating
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
boundary
lines
particularly
the
cherokee
and
in
locating
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
corners
at
or
near
fort
smith.
now,
the
trial
court
found
and
its
finding
was
not
challenged,
that
this
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
was
navigable
in
fact
and
in
law
at
the
time
the
western
domains,
now
a
part
of
oklahoma,
were
ceded
to
the
choctaw
nation
and
to
the
cherokee
nation
and
at
the
time
the
treaties
were
made,
pursuant
to
which
the
lands
were
ceded
and
also
at
the
time
oklahoma
was
admitted
to
statehood
on
november
16,
1907.
we
consider
the
fact
of
established
navigability
at
the
time
these
treaties
were
made
to
be
a
very
important
fact.
that
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court
and
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
case.
now
we,
in
substance,
rest
our
case
on
the
laws
of
governing
navigable
waters
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
particularly
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
shively
versus
bowlby
and
u.s.a.
versus
holt
state
bank.
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
mr.
justice
mckinley
in
an
opinion
written
in
1845
referring
to
an
opinion
written
in
1842
by
mr.
justice
taney
said
in
the
case
of
martin
et.
al.
versus
waddell,
16
peters
410,
the
present
chief
justice
taney
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
“when
the
revolution
took
place,
the
people
of
each
state
became
themselves
sovereign
and
in
that
character
hold
the
absolute
right
to
all
their
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
for
their
own
common
use,
subject
only
to
the
rights
since
surrendered
by
the
constitution.”
in
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
the
court
went
on
and
said,
“we
have
arrived
at
these
general
conclusions;
first,
the
shores
of
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
were
not
granted
by
the
constitution
to
the
united
states,
but
were
reserved
to
the
states
respectively.
second,
the
new
states
have
the
same
rights,
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
over
this
subject
as
the
original
states.
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
admitted
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
and
we
say
that
this
law
is
it
that
was
applicable,
set
forth
in
the
case
of
martin
versus
waddell
and
the
case
of
pollard
versus
hagan
is
still
applicable
today.
now,
the
most
complete
and
erudite
opinion
that
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
the
rights
of
the
states
with
respect
to
navigable
waters
was
written
by
mr.
justice
gray
in
the
case
of
shively
versus
bowlby
in
1893.
in
that
case
mr.
justice
gray
commented
that
this
was
an
occasion
suitable
for
a
complete
review
of
the
law
as
had
been
involved.
he
went
back
to
the
beginning
to
the
common
law
of
england
as
applied
in
the
american
colonies
to
the
common
law
as
applied
after
the
revolution.
he
reviewed
the
whole
range
of
decisions
that
had
been
handed
down
since
then
and
wrote
what
seem
us
to
be
a
guiding
opinion
in
this
litigation.
now,
he
did
say
that
he
--
when
the
united
states
acquires
a
territory,
it
does
have
a
demonstrative
jurisdiction
over
it
and
it
holds
it
in
trust
for
the
formation
of
future
states.
now,
he
says
some
certain
dispositions
can
be
made
when
necessary
by
the
united
states
during
territorial
period.
he
said
we
cannot
doubt
therefore,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
make
grants
of
land
below
high
watermark
of
navigable
waters
in
any
territory
of
the
united
states,
whenever
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so,
first
in
order
to
perform
international
obligations;
second
to
effect
of
improvement
of
such
lands
for
promotion
and
convenience
of
the
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
sovereign
states;
or
third
to
carry
out
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
now,
he
goes
further
in
that
opinion
and
he
defines
what
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory
are.
with
respect
to
that
he
said
this,
“and
the
territories
acquired
by
congress
whether
by
deed
of
cession
from
the
original
states
or
by
treaty
with
a
foreign
country
are
held
with
the
object
as
soon
as
their
population
and
condition
justify
it
of
being
admitted
into
the
union
as
states
upon
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
in
all
respects.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
disposing
of
the
public
lands
has
constantly
acted
upon
the
theory
that
those
lands
whether
in
interior
or
on
the
coast,
above
high
water
mark
they
be
taken
up
by
actual
occupants
in
order
to
encourage
the
settlement
of
the
country.
but
the
navigable
waters
and
the
soils
under
them
whether
within
or
above
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
shall
be
and
remain
public
highways
and
being
chiefly
valuable
for
the
public
purposes
of
commerce,
navigation
and
fishery
for
the
improvements
necessary
to
secure
and
promote
those
purposes
shall
not
be
granted
away
during
the
period
of
territorial
government,
but
unless
in
case
of
some
international
duty
or
public
exigency
shall
be
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
or
public
exigency.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
have
mentioned
the
one
before.
the
first
three
that
we
mentioned
before:
perform
international
obligations,
effect
improvement
of
lands
for
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
sovereign
states,
or
to
carry
out
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
they
hold
the
territory.
and
they
defined
objects
for
which
the
hold
the
territory
as
being
the
formation
of
a
future
state
--
future
states,
that
is
the
object
that
he's
talking
about.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
domestic
purpose.
i
would
say
that
the
formation
of
the
future
state
would
be
a
domestic
purpose.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say
under
shively
versus
bowlby,
it
certainly
would
not
be
one
of
the
objects
for
which
united
states
holds
the
territory,
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
think
it
would
be
yes.
i
would
question
it
under
shively
versus
bowlby.
now
we
go
further
and
say
however
we
don't
need
to
meet
that
because
it
didn't
convey
it
to
them.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'll
reach
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
am
indeed
sir.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
not
within
the
boundaries
of
the
cherokee
granted
here,
mr.
justice
white,
according
to
our
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that
will
be
a
part
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
and
i
might
say
that
we
differ
on
the
facts
and
the
holding
of
that
case,
and
the
counsel
for
the
choctaws
who
has
argued
previously.
we
have
set
forth
however
our
understanding
of
the
facts
on
the
holding
of
that
case
on
pages
35
to
37
of
our
brief
and
we
refer
the
court
to
that.
i
won't
go
into
that
in
detail
here
at
this
time.
but
to
get
--
in
that
case,
the
court
actually
reaffirmed
the
principles
laid
down
in
shively
versus
bowlby
where
they
said
the
united
states
early
adopted
and
constantly
hasn't
heard
to
the
policy
of
regarding
lands
under
navigable
waters
and
acquired
territory
while
under
its
sole
dominion.
it's
held
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
future
states
and
so
has
refrained
from
making
any
disposal
thereof
say
in
exceptional
instances
when
impelled
to
particular
disposals
by
some
international
duty
or
public
exigency.
it
follows
from
this
that
disposals
by
the
united
states
during
the
territorial
period
are
not
likely
to
be
inferred,
should
not
be
regarded
as
intended
unless
the
intention
was
definitely
declared
or
otherwise
made
very
plain.
that
language
was
used
with
respect
to
a
statute,
the
united
states
statute
in
a
form
of
a
treaty
with
the
chippewas
which
set
aside
a
reservation,
a
red
lake
reservation.
within
the
reservation
was
a
navigable
lake,
mud
lake.
mud
lake
was
not
mentioned
as
being
conveyed
to
the
chippewas
and
the
court
held
it
was
not
conveyed
because
there
was
not
a
specific
reference
to
mud
lake
in
the
patent.
that
was
a
holding
in
this
case
of
this
court
in
holt
state
bank.
we
say
that
applies
with
respect
to
the
arkansas
river
here
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
part
where
the
cherokees
have
land
on
each
side.
now,
there
is
--
with
respect
to
the
chippewa
title
which
has
been
questioned
here;
that
title
we
think
is
a
good
reservation
title.
it
has
been
so
defined
and
held
in
minnesota
versus
hitchcock
185
u.s.
373
and
a
similar
type
of
title
has
been
affirmed
in
the
united
states
versus
santa
fe
pacific
railroad
company,
314
u.s.
339
with
respect
to
the
hualapai
tribe
in
arizona.
the
patents
issued
to
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
were
authorized
by
the
indian
removal
act
of
may
28,
1830.
that
provided
that
for
granting
patents
in
removed
indian
tribes
and
contained
a
provision
that
provided
always
that
such
land
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
if
the
indians
become
extinct
or
abandon
the
same.
so,
the
cherokee
patent
pursuant
to
that
indian
removal
act
provides
the
lands
hereby
granted
shall
revert
to
the
united
states
if
the
cherokee
nation
ceases
and
abandons
the
same.
the
choctaw
patent
provides,
it
shall
inhere
to
them
as
long
as
they
shall
exist
as
a
nation
and
live
on
it.
now,
coming
to
the
cherokee
treaties
and
the
cherokee
patent
on
the
subject
that
you
expressed
particular
interest
in,
mr.
justice
white,
the
western
cherokees'
first
land
in
oklahoma
was
acquired
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
1828,
7
stat.
311.
in
that
treaty,
it
was
agreed
that
seven
million
acres
of
land
plus
an
outlet
west
should
be
conveyed
to
the
cherokees.
the
description
of
the
land
was
incomplete.
when
they
got
to
the
--
where
the
arkansas
comes
to
a
confluence
with
the
canadian,
they
angled
off
up
between
the
two
and
they
didn't
close
it
with
the
arkansas
state
line,
but
they
have
provided
they'd
have
a
survey
and
which
would
correct
all
that.
the
1833
treaty
with
the
western
cherokees
has
also
covered
the
same
land
substantially
except
that
down
toward
the
lower
part,
the
boundary
line
between
the
creeks
and
the
cherokees
was
straightened
out
and
settled
whereas
under
the
1828
treaty
it
was
left
open
up
in
the
area,
i
might
say
it,
but
that
boundary
was
left
open
to
on
the
north
westerly
side.
but
the
parties
had
in
mind
having
a
survey
and
they
did
have
a
survey
and
it
was
conducted,
shortly
work
on
it
was
commenced,
shortly
after
the
1828
treaty,
under
the
direction
of
reverend
isaac
mccoy
who
was
commissioned
to
do
the
surveying
by
the
war
department.
the
map
which
we
have
provided
for
the
court
here
is
the
result,
the
final
result
of
reverend
mccoy's
surveying
work
down
under
reverend
mccoy
and
his
basis
for
the
description
in
the
cherokee
patent.
the
field
notes
which
we
have
provided
the
court
with
copies
on
enlarged
basis,
both
of
which
are
in
our
briefs
as
appendix,
describe
the
first
line
that
was
run
by
that
surveying
crew
under
mccoy's
direction
by
a
surveyor
by
the
name
of
donaldson.
in
that
line,
he
ran
the
line
between
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
cherokees
on
the
west
and
the
state
arkansas
on
the
east
when
he
comes
down
to
this
corner
and
he
uses
as
a
reference
point,
the
land
in
the
choctaw
corner
across
the
river
which
he
fixes
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
and
he
sets
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river.
now,
the
cherokee
patent
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
yes
that's
on
the
arkansas
line
just
west
of
fort
smith.
the
line
that
was
run
from
north
where
the
arkansas
river
runs
across
the
arkansas
state
line,
the
line
between
arkansas
and
the
cherokees.
now,
in
that
--
in
those
field
notes
which
you
have
a
copy
up
there.
this
surveyor,
they
are
very
voluminous,
we
have
the
field
notes
but
they
are
about
four
inches
thick.
we
only
put
in
the
part
referring
to
this
problem
and
here's
what
the
surveyor
says
in
respect
to
that
point.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i'm
quoting
from
our
appendix
four,
our
appendix
four
which
is
there
as
marked
in
here
on
the
copy
you
have
there.
mile

and
set,

change
left
came

and
entered
into
open
prairie
bottom
rich
soil,

changed
to
[inaudible]
again,

changed
to
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas

set
a
stake
and
made
round
it
from
which
62

to

marked
[inaudible]
76ms,
36
degrees,
no
minutes
east,
a
cotton
wood
marked
u.s.
76m.
at
this
point
has
fixed
the
southeast
corner
of
the
cherokee
lands.
that's
along
the
channel
of
the
river
664.50
chance
to
the
south
bank
where
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
choctaw
land
strikes
the
river.
now,
he
does
that
for
a
reference
point.
he's
surveying
the
cherokee
boundary,
but
he
is
referring
to
another
point
which
helped
set
up
his
point,
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
a
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
on
the
north
bank
he
says.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
said
after
he
fixes
the
north
bank.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
that's
right,
right,
and
right
and
there
he
fixes
the
choctaw
corner.
so
he
fixes
the
cherokee
corner
on
the
north
bank
and
the
choctaw
corner
on
the
south
bank.
now,
let's
take
the
--
now
those
field
notes
are
--
should
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
cherokee
patent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
would
say
that
if
it's
in
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states,
the
description
would
have
called
for
it
to
be
down
the
middle
of
the
stream.
we
have
--
we
have
cited
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
it's
not
a
rule
of
construction,
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
have
cited
on
our
brief
the
conveyance
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
we
have
a
contemporaneous
patent.
we
have
a
contemporaneous
definition
of
the
line
of
the
state
of
missouri
which
we
have
cited
on
the
brief
which
was
made
an
1820,
almost
contemporaneous
with
these
documents
and
they
called
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well,
this
is
a
navigable
stream.
in
this
case
there
is
no
--
this
particular
authority,
you're
reading
to
me,
i'm
not
sure
the
context
of
it,
or
what
it
would
be
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes,
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
any
event,
let
me
read
from
you
from
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
mingus
case.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
atlantic
pacific
railroad
company
versus
mingus,
165
u.s.
413
and
referring
to
the
--
these
indian
tribes,
the
cherokee
tribe
in
particular,
they
said,
in
some
respects
they
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
federal
government
as
the
territory
did
in
its
second
grade
of
government
under
the
ordinance
of
1787.
such
territory
passed
its
own
laws
subject
to
the
approval
of
congress
and
its
inhabitants
were
subject
to
the
constitution
and
acts
of
congress.
the
principal
difference
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
cherokees
enact
their
own
laws
under
the
restriction
stated,
to
appoint
their
own
officers
and
pay
their
own
expenses.
this
however
is
no
reason
why
the
laws
and
the
proceeds
of
the
cherokee
territory
so
far
as
it
relates
to
rights
claimed
under
them
should
not
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
as
other
territories
in
the
union.
it
is
not
a
foreign,
but
a
domestic
territory,
a
territory
which
originated
under
our
constitution
and
laws.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
are
a
domestic
dependent
nation,
mr.
justice
marshall
as
defined
by
this
court.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
what
is
that?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
well
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
they
have
no
army,
that's
correct.
they
have
the
word
nation,
but
it
was
a
very
dependent
nation.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
even
said
that
their
lack
of
relationships
like
a
ward
to
a
guardian,
that's
how
much
of
a
nation
they
were.
now,
the
cherokee
patent
conveys
this
land,
covers
this
land
pursuant
to
the
survey,
pursuant
to
the
isaac
mccoy's
survey.
it
refers
to
the
description
in
the
survey.
the
patent
is
dated
december
31,
1838
and
found
at
appendix
nine
of
our
brief.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i've
been
unable
to
find
the
language
you're
talking
about.
let
me
read
where
it
reaches
that
point.
the
patent
as
i
say
which
is
found
in
appendix
nine
of
our
brief
getting
when
it
comes
down
to
the
canadian
river,
thence
down
to
the
canadian
river
on
it's
north
bank
to
it's
junction
with
the
arkansas
river.
excuse
me,
i'll
turn
to
that
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
perhaps
so,
i'm
not
sure.
any
out
of
patent
is
in
--
the
complete
patents
in
appendix
9.
the
complete
patent
is
in
appendix
nine
of
our
brief.
it's
also
on
page
53
of
our
brief.
alright,
and
we
get
to
this
point,
you
find
a
point
thence
down
the
canadian
river
on
its
north
bank,
“thence
down
of
the
canadian
river
to
its
north
bank
to
its
junction
with
the
arkansas
river,
thence
down
the
main
channel
of
arkansas
river
to
the
western
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
lands
of
the
choctaws
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river,
four
chains
and
54
lengths
east
of
fort
smith
thence
north
and
thence
north.”
now,
we
say
that's
a
reference
point.
we
say
the
word
“at”
means
in
the
vicinity
and
we
say
that
it's
simply
a
double
reference
for
the
surveyor's
accuracy
and
it
does
not
take
the
choctaw
bound
--
the
cherokee
boundary
to
the
south
bank
of
the
river.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
right,
right,
opposite
north
corner,
at
the
corner
shown
by
the
field
notes
of
the
survey
and
so
that's
where
we
say
the
description
goes
and
by
the
way
that
is
the
only
reference
to
any
point
south
of
the
river
in
the
old
cherokee
patent.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
have
not
included
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
may
have
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
yes.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
i
may
have
read
them,
but
i
don't
have
them
freshly
in
mind
as
now.
but
we
say
this
is
contemporaneous.
the
contemporaneous
maps
with
field
notes
are
the
ones
that
are
legally
effective
in
this
situation,
in
this
case.
now,
that
is
--
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
he
may
have
been
given
those
instructions
but
the
land
are
previously
been
conveyed.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no
it
is
not
in
the
record.
we
say
that
now
we
have
another
argument
put
forward
by
appellants
to
which
i
should
give
some
note
here.
they
have
argued
that
because
there
were
provisions
in
the
treaties
that
at
no
time
would
the
lands
ceded
to
them
be
included
in
the
boundaries
--
within
the
boundaries
of
a
territory
or
state.
they
contended
that
therefore
there
could
not
have
been
any
holding
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
a
future
territory
or
state.
we
say
that
that
conclusion
is
erroneous
and
faulty.
we
say
that
the
cherokee
treaty
in
particular
says
without
their
consent
that
practically
implies
that
their
consent
could
be
sought
and
obtained
that
they
might
have
in
mind.
we
have
cited
congressional
reports
and
a
great
deal
of
other
data
which
shows
that
future
states
were
contemplated
in
this
area.
the
facts
are
that
the
lands
conveyed
to
them
were
not
included
in
a
future
territory
or
state
without
their
consent.
their
consent
was
obtained.
they
have
made
agreements
with
the
united
state
government
for
the
allotment
of
their
lands,
made
agreements
that
their
tribal
sovereignty
should
be
relinquished
in
favor
of
the
allottees,
made
agreements
that
the
laws
or
their
tribal
law
should
be
superseded
by
the
laws
of
arkansas.
they
were
admitted
to
citizenship
in
the
united
states
as
full
citizens.
they
put
themselves
and
were
put
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interior
department
as
to
all
of
their
tribal
affairs.
we
say
that
they
did
consent
to
become
a
part
of
the
future
state.
they
voted
on
the
admission
of
oklahoma
as
a
future
state
and
therefore
the
united
states
kept
faith
with
them
and
they
were
included
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
with
their
consent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
my
co-counsel
has
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white
that
i
may
have
overlooked,
you
were
referring
to
appendix
f
of
the
cherokee
brief.
the
report
of
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
john
d.c.
atkinson
–
atkins.
in
that
report
he
traces
the
various
surveys
that
were
made
and
comes
to
the
–
he
shows
that
three
earliest
surveyors,
either
fixed
the
corners
of
the
cherokees
or
choctaw
or
both
on
the
north
or
south
bank
of
the
river
respectively.
he
himself
later
surveyed,
the
ones
that
you
were
talking
about
were
seeking
to
relocate
the
old
survey
boundaries.
i
think
this
is
what
you
were
talking
about.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
no,
we
--
those
have
never
been
researched
or
provided.
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
is
my
time
up?
mr.
m.
darwin
kirk
thank
you
sir.
