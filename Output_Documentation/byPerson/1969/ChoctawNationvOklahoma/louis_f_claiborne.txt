mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hesitate
to
detain
the
court
much
longer
in
these
cases
arguing
on
the
same
side
but
perhaps
i
can
perform
some
service
to
the
court
as
an
amicus
curiae
if
i
attempt
to
very
briefly
summarize
and
perhaps
simplify
the
issues
as
we
see
them.
the
first
fact
which
we
would
stress
in
this
case
is
that
here
we
have
clear
cut
conveyances
of
large
tracts
of
lands
to
these
three
indian
tribes,
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws,
together
with
cherokees
separately.
the
sequence
of
those
grants
seems
to
us
of
no
great
importance.
it
happens
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
treaties
the
choctaws
come
first
and
the
cherokee
is
second.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
patents,
it's
the
other
way
around.
the
important
thing
however
is
that
there
were
grants
in
fee
simple
to
these
tribes
of
very
large
tracts
adjacent
one
to
the
other
and
between
them,
entirely
surrounding
and
encompassing
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
but
the
fact
that
there's
a
conveyance
in
fee
simple
immediately
distinguishes
the
holt
state
bank
case
which
is
invoked
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
there,
there
was
no
conveyance
whatever
nor
was
there
even
a
setting
aside
of
the
portion
of
the
aboriginal
lands
of
the
chippewas
which
was
reserved
to
the
tribe.
those
reserved
lands,
well
lands
which
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
united
states
always
owned
in
--
always
had
the
title
to,
the
indians
simply
had
a
right
of
occupancy.
therefore
the
united
states
always
owned
the
beds
of
the
navigable
rivers
and
of
the
mud
lake
which
was
at
issue
in
the
holt
state
bank
case
and
there
was
no
act,
no
transaction
which
ever
changed
that
situation,
whereas
here,
there
is.
the
united
states
cedes
these
tracts
to
the
indian
tribes
and
the
burden
it
seems
to
us
is
on
the
other
side
to
show
why
the
beds
of
the
river
did
not
go
with
the
grants.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
would
be
a
--
we
could
make
the
same
argument
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
it
helps
us
here
that
the
river
is
entirely
enveloped
in
indian
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
such
situation
with
respect
to
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
in
this
case.
if
perhaps
your
honor
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
navigable
portion.
perhaps
though
the
physical
situation
ought
to
be
clarified.
once
again
referring
to
page
25
of
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
choctaw
nation,
to
the
rather
small
white
brief,
a
very
simplified
map
which
seems
to
me
presents
the
situation
as
clearly
as
it
can
be.
you'll
notice,
there's
a
triangle,
at
the
top
of
the
triangle,
fort
gibson.
on
the
right
hand
side
of
that
triangle
is
a
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
on
the
left
hand
side
of
that
triangle
coming
down
is
the
more
or
less
straight
line
which
represents
the
western
edge
of
the
cherokee
grant
and
at
the
south
is
a
portion
of
the
canadian
river.
now
that
triangle
is
part
of
the
cherokee
grant.
so
is
of
course
the
portion
indicated
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
creeks'
seminal
claim
begins
west
of
that
so-called
straight
line.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
white
that
triangle
belongs
to
the
cherokees.
therefore
the
cherokees
have
land
on
both
sides
of
the
arkansas
river.
that
triangle
south
of
fort
gibson
is
cherokee
land
as
is
what
is
north
and
east
of
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
non-navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
but
none
which
is
relevant
to
the
portion
of
the
river
which
is
in
controversy
here.
but
the
fact
that
this
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
between
fort
gibson
and
its
confluence
with
the
canadian
river
is
entirely
within
the
cherokee
grant,
hence
to
simplify
the
matter
in
that
here
we
at
least
we
need
not
talk
about
which
grant
came
first
and
whether
the
united
states
reserved
to
itself
the
portion
that
was
not
yet
granted
to
an
indian
tribe
and
yet
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
--
makes
the
same
argument
here
as
it
does
further
east.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
would
seem
to
be
right,
i
think.
anyway
from
fort
gibson
to
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
now
i
would
say
that
whether
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
first
grant
any
of
the
bed
was
granted
or
whether
all
of
it
was
granted
in
that
first
grant
and
or
the
second
grant
only
came
to
the
river's
edge
or
the
other
way
around
is
a
debate
as
between
the
two
tribes
that
need
not
concern
this
court,
that
its
not
presented
here
and
that
would
of
course
be
reached
in
the
event
the
indians
were
to
prevail
here.
i
should
say
that
the
cherokees'
only
claim
to
the
thread
where
the
river
is
the
boundary
between
them
whereas
the
choctaw
has
claimed
the
whole
of
the
bed,
but
we
certainly
take
no
position
as
to
who
is
right
or
wrong
in
that
debate
nor
should
this
court
at
this
time
concern
itself
with
that
intramural
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart
of
course
only
as
to
the
portion
east
of
the
confluence
of
the
arkansas
and
canadian
river
and
as
to
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
to
the
extent
that
the
bed
had
not
been
included
in
the
first
grant,
it
must
have
been
included
in
the
second
to
--
except
that
it
was
already
fully
included
in
the
first,
it
could
of
course
not
be
included
in
the
second.
the
languages
of
the
two
events
is
not
identical
and
is
simply
in
each
a
reference
to
the
river
as
a
boundary
without
indicating,
it
seems
to
us
in
any
clear
way
whether
it
goes
to
the
thread,
to
the
other
bank
or
stops
at
the
nearer
bank.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
don't
think
the
disposition
of
this
case
in
either
the
court's
below
turned
on
that
technical
reading
of
the
patent
or
of
the
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
can't
say
that
they
couldn't
believe
such
an
argument
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
raised
and
certainly
in
a
much
more
full
fledged
way
now
in
the
briefs
in
--
on
the
merits
in
this
court
than
it
was
before
and
really
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
evident
that
one
cannot
resolve
the
controversy
simply
by
looking
no
further
than
the
language
of
these
conveyances.
one
must
construe
them
because
they
are
ambiguous
in
terms
of
the
apparent
intent
of
the
conveyor
and
the
recipient.
and
it's
to
that
--
it's
on
that
basis,
the
court
of
appeal
disposed
of
this
case
and
to
that
extent,
we
agree
that
that's
the
correct
basis.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
quarrel
mr.
chief
justice
at
the
time
that
the
vendor,
the
united
states
had
full
on
incumbent
title.
whether
it
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
quite
so
but
it
is
our
intent
to
show
that
the
realities
then
prevailing
would
indicate
that
these
conveyances
ought
to
be
construed
so
as
to
include
and
not
exclude
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
in
these
large
grants
to
indian
tribes
in
what
was
then
thought
to
be
a
forever
more
indian
territory.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
or
either
or
both
grants
taken
together.
we
must
remember
that
these
grants
were
both
contemplated
at
the
time
either
one
was
finalized
because
they
had
both
had
prior
histories
in
the
prior
treaties
that
simply
without
finalizing
made
indications
that
this
lands
would
become
available
to
one
tribe
or
the
other.
as
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
i
had
said
that
the
conveyances
to
these
two
tribes
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaws
taken
together
encompassed
the
riverbed
of
the
arkansas
river.
in
one
instance
the
riverbed
or
the
river
was
entirely
surrounded
by
cherokee
land
in
the
other
portion
--
or
the
other
portion,
in
dispute
it
formed
the
boundary
between
the
territory
granted
to
those
two
tribes.
as
to
that
latter
portion,
the
suggestion
that
somehow
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
was
included
in
neither
grant
is
somewhat
comparable
to
what
maybe
a
suggestion
when
say
the
states
of
louisiana
or
mississippi
were
admitted
to
the
union
where
the
mississippi
river
is
the
boundary
between
them
and
because
the
acts
of
admission
in
each
case
read
to
the
river
or
up
the
river
or
down
the
main
channel
of
the
river
as
these
conveyances
do.
the
conclusion
were
reached
that
the
mississippi
river
were
included
neither
in
mississippi
nor
in
louisiana,
a
result
which
we
would
strain
to
avoid
because
it
obviously
makes
no
sense.
that
is
quite
comparable
to
the
situation
here.
we're
not
dealing
with
grants
--
small
grants
to
private
landowners
we
are
dealing
with
what
amount
to
large
territories
ceded
to
quasi-sovereign
tribes
then
defined
as
nations,
in
that
time
considered
quasi-independent.
the
treaties,
the
fact
that
we
dealt
with
them
by
treaties
of
course
indicates
that
approach
of
dealing
with
indian
tribes
as
independent
entities.
the
treaties
themselves
are
recognized,
powers
extensive
power
of
self-government
in
these
tribes.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
approach
to
reserve,
to
attempt
to
reserve,
to
wish
to
reserve,
to
have
any
interest
in
reserving
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
or
any
other
territory
within
the
area
ceded
except
only
as
the
united
states
might
have
some
special
reason
for
doing
so
such
as
maintaining
the
area
around
fort
gibson
in
the
middle
of
the
cherokee
grants
which
was
expressly
done.
so
here,
they
might
have
been
interest
in
the
united
states
in
reserving
a
right
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
and
that
can
be
read
into
this
grants
to
the
chapters
in
cherokees
but
of
course
the
navigational
servitude
which
appertains
to
the
united
states
in
all
states
does
not
carry
in
it
an
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
river
and
there
is
no
reason
to
so
read
it
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
precisely,
mr.
justice
black.
at
that
time,
it
was
not
known
that
the
bed
of
this
river
would
become
valuable.
there
was
therefore
no
reason
for
the
united
states
withhold
for
its
own
benefit
of
the
bed
of
this
river.
all
it
was
concerned
about
or
it
could
be
concerned
about
was
to
preserve
its
right
to
maintain
it
as
an
open
highway
of
commerce
and
as
a
way
of
access
to
fort
gibson
within
the
indian
territory
but
as
to
the
bed
there
was
no
reason
for
the
united
states
to
wish
to
retrieve
ownership.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
today,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
its
oil.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
this
controversy
arises
because
very
valuable
oil
deposits
have
been
discovered
in
the
bed
of
the
river
and
so
the
matter
becomes
an
important
practical
dispute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
the
practical
questions
mr.
justice
black.
now,
as
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
we
say
that
the
doctrine
has
no
application
here.
first,
we
point
out
that
it
hadn't
been
invented
yet
pollard
versus
hagan,
the
first
case
in
this
court
to
apply
that
rule
thought
from
inevitable
rule
was
some
years
after
these
grants
to
these
indian
tribes.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were.
they
certainly
were.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
white
but
they
could
be
--
they
said
it
were
cherokee
and
creek
lands
bordering
on
the
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
above
fort
gibson.
i
already
am
not,
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
i
think
true,
mr.
justice
white.
i
thought
it
was
agreed
by
all
parties
and
i
made
the
misspeaking
that
the
navigable
course
of
the
arkansas
river
ends
at
fort
gibson.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
cannot
answer.
perhaps,
one
of
the
other
counsel
will
know
--
will
know
better.
as
i
say,
the
equal
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
claim
oklahoma
claim
make
to
the
bed
of
the
river
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
the
only
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
never
included
in
any
grants
or
any
indian
in
which
event
it
still
belongs
to
the
united
states
or
still
did
at
the
time
of
--
well
i
suppose
it's
--
i
am
not
sure.
it
may
still
then
belong
to
the
united
states.
well,
never
having
been
ceded
to
the
state
expressly
but
when
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
put,
i'm
not
clear
whether
those
grants
were
on
as
a
categorically
feasible
grants.
i
am
clear
that
those
grant's
were
not
made
with
stipulation
which
is
quite
relevant
here
that
the
present
lands
would
never
under
any
circumstance
being
incorporated
within
the
state
and
that
they
will
it
in
perpetuity
as
a
permanent
home.
this
language
being
appropriate
precisely
because
these
tribes
had
been
so
often
shifted
westwood
that
it
was
appropriate
to
at
long
last
seem
to
be
guaranteeing
them
a
place
from
which
they
would
not
be
evicted,
though
in
the
end
they
were
evicted
from
oklahoma
as
well.
as
i
said,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
inappropriate
here,
first
because
it
haven't
been
device
yet
and
therefore
can
hardly
be
suppose
to
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
grantors
but
mostly
because
that
is
a
doctrine
which
is
--
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
future
state.
here
we
have
an
expressed
decoration
in
both
treaties
to
the
effect
that
never
will
a
state
be
created
in
this
territory
and
therefore
no
occasion
to
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state
that
will
never
come
into
existence
in
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
as
to
your
first
question,
the
tribe
retains
an
existence
and
does
now
have
tribal
property
as
oppose
to
the
form
of
property
which
has
been
subdivided
among
the
individual
regions
there
is
a
tribal
counsel,
there
is
a
tribal
government,
there
are
tribal
funds
which
are
administered
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
tribe,
some
of
those
for
school
purposes.
what
would
happen
and
how
the
indians
would
choose
to
appropriate
the
revenues
from
these
oil
lands
are
not
clear.
it
might
be
that
because
technically,
the
property
would
lie
in
trust
with
the
united
states
that
some
supervision
of
these
revenues
would
lie
with
the
department
of
interior.
that
the
question
frankly
hasn't
been
fully
explored
and
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
resolve,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
are,
as
i
understand
it
cherokee
and
choctaw
schools
maintained
with
tribal
funds
derived
from
other
common
tribal
property.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
that
they
do,
though
some
of
them
attend
the
state
schools.
they're
free
to
do
it
your
honor.
but
they
do
use
some
of
the
tribal
funds,
for
that
purpose,
sole
purpose.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white,
and
not
for
the
whole.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
really
two
arguments
made
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
order
to
claim
the
bed
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
which
is
in
dispute
here.
the
first
is
that
these
indian
tribes
never
obtained
title
to
the
bed.
the
second
is
that
if
they
did,
they
lost
it
at
some
subsequent
time.
as
to
the
first
proposition
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
would
say
--
well,
they
don't
press
these
arguments.
they
have
suggested
here
and
there.
i
take
it
that
they're
not
pressed
as
their
main
arguments,
“lost
by
voluntarily
relinquishment
in
the
1890's
just
prior
to
statehood,”
that
is
prior
to
oklahoma
statehood.
they
have
received
that
they
have
taken
from
them
or
that
they
gave
it
away
when
they
agreed
to
an
allotment
of
their
land
or
were
forced
to
allot
their
lands.
the
second
of
these
arguments
would
be
that
they
cease
to
exist
as
a
nation
and
therefore
under
the
terms
of
the
grants,
these
communal
tribal
lands
reverted
to
united
states
and
in
turn
inundate
to
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that
is
an
argument
which
barely
suggested
by
oklahoma
and
i
hope
not
seriously
pressed.
more
seriously,
i
think,
they
suggest
that
neither
tribe
the
choctaws,
chickasaws
together
nor
the
cherokees
ever
obtained
title
to
the
bed
of
the
river
and
i
make
two
arguments
in
that
respect.
the
first
is
that
as
a
technical
manner
conveyancing,
these
treaties
and
patents
did
not
embrace
the
bed
of
the
river.
the
second
is
that
even
if
the
patents
broadly
embrace
the
bed
that
was
an
implied
reservation
by
the
united
states
in
these
grants
for
the
benefit
of
some
future
state.
as
to
the
first
proposition,
i
think
what
is
most
noteworthy
when
one
traces
down
the
various
descriptions
and
the
various
treaties
and
the
various
patents
is
that
the
grant
to
the
cherokees
and
the
grants
to
the
choctaws
are
always
defined
one
with
relation
to
the
other.
the
boundary
between
them
is
spoken
of
as
common
corner,
the
cherokee
corner
or
the
choctaw
corner
at
the
extreme
downward
point
of
the
arkansas
river.
there
are
references
to
the
river
which
talk
about
down
the
main
channel
which
doesn't
sound
like
along
the
north
bank.
finally,
and
i
think
most
of
persuasive,
is
the
almost
unthinkable
proposition
that
in
grants
of
this
size
and
as
the
little
map
i
have
prepared
for
the
court
indicates,
the
whole
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
except
the
panhandle
was
granted
to
three
indian
tribes.
the
cherokees
at
the
north,
the
creeks
and
seminoles
in
the
center,
choctaws
and
chickasaws
at
the
bottom,
each
of
these
grants
is
of
a
huge
tract
of
land.
in
the
case
of
the
cherokees,
it's
an
approximately
14
million
acres,
roughly
three
times
the
size
of
maryland.
the
choctaw
and
the
chickasaw
grant
is
considerably
larger.
all
of
this
territory,
west
of
the
arkansas
boundary
was
intended
to
be
and
to
remain
indian
territory.
these
enormous
grants
to
what
were
then
described
as
nations
meant
to
remain
forever
as
quasi-independent,
quasi-sovereign
states.
it
is
unthinkable,
i
think,
that
the
riverbeds
were
meant
to
be
left
out
when
all
of
this
territory
west
of
the
line
was
confined
to
the
tribes
all
in
contiguous
grants.
much
the
same
considerations
weigh
against
the
second
argument
advanced
by
oklahoma,
which
is
that
the
united
states
impliedly
reserved
the
beds
even
though
they're
caught
within
the
description.
i
should
emphasize
that
in
one
instance,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
bed
of
the
river
is
caught
within
the
description
of
that
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
that
is
entirely
embraced
by
cherokee
lands
on
both
sides
which
runs
from
fort
gibson
to
the
confluence
of
the
arkansas
with
the
canadian
river.
now
the
notion
that
the
united
states
would
have,
in
this
instance,
reserve
to
itself
the
benefit
of
a
future
state,
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
insofar
as
it
was
navigable
is
at
odds
both
with
the
understanding
of
the
times.
first
of
all,
that
doctrine
had
not
yet
been
articulated
and
it's
only
several
years
later,
this
court
for
the
first
time
developed
that
proposition.
but
leaving
that
aside
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
do
not
take
a
position
with
respect
to
the
intramural
debate
as
between
the
two
tribes.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
description
is
ambiguous.
it
certainly
does
not
show
any
intent
to
exclude
the
bed
of
the
river.
as
to
which
of
the
two
tribes
has
the
better
claim
is
a
matter
which
i
should
think
this
court
would
leave
to
the
lower
courts
which
have
not
ruled
on
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
--
there
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
choctaws
claim
the
whole
of
it,
the
cherokees
claim
the
north
half
of
it.
obviously,
there's
an
overlapping
claim
here
which
i
don't
think
is
to
be
disposed
of
by
this
court.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
picking
up
from
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
let
me
say
broadly
that
the
realistic
situation
here
is
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
determine
that
all
lands
west
of
a
certain
boundary
that
ultimately
was
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas
should
be
indian
lands,
a
whole
enormous
territory
which
includes
present
oklahoma
and
some
other
lands.
subsequently,
it
was
determined
to
divide
that
acreage
between
these
several
tribes.
the
exact
descriptions
of
that
division
should
not
be
dispositive
as
to
whether
all
of
that
indian
country
was
then
meant
to
be
and
to
remain
an
indian
territory.
from
that
point
on,
from
the
1820's
on
and
later
when
this
territory
was
called
the
indian
territory,
nobody
ever
thought
that
any
portion
of
it
had
been
kept
back.
the
exact
boundaries
between
the
several
grants
were
matters
of
some
dispute.
some
of
the
grants
originally
were
overlapping,
were
found
to
be
overlapping
and
were
then
corrected,
but
the
general
picture
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
statement,
is
that
all
of
that
land
was
meant
to
be
indian
land
in
which
white
settlers
were
excluded
and
it
ought
not
to
be
dispositive
whether
the
coals
in
certain
surveys
exactly
match
or
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
here
that
the
descriptions
do
show
a
contiguous
boundary
between
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
grant
where
the
oklahoma
--
where
the
arkansas
river
is
the
boundary
between
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
dispute
as
between
the
tribes
of
oklahoma,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
it
was
always
there
from
the
point
when
oklahoma
became
a
state.
since
we
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
letter
from
the
interior
department
which
is
reprinted
at
the
back
of
our
brief
in
1908
indicates
that
at
that
time,
there
was
already
some
question
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
or
whether
the
tribes
own
the
bed.
at
that
time
it
was
simply
sand
and
gravel
removal,
it
was
not
oil
or
gas.
the
value
of
the
bed
at
that
time
i
suppose
was
minimal.
i
may
say
also
that
to
the
extent
that
these
tribes
are
taxed
with
not
having
brought
this
suit
earlier,
it
was
not
at
all
clear.
in
fact,
it
was
assumed
after
cherokee
nation
versus
georgia
that
these
tribes
have
no
standing
of
their
own
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
and
because
they
couldn't
bring
one
in
the
state
court
without
the
consent
of
the
state.
it
was
only
in
your
opinion
mr.
justice
black
in
the
creek
case
in
318
u.s.
decided
in
1944
that
for
the
very
first
time
it
was
said,
it
wasn't
a
holding,
it
was
a
dictum,
but
it
was
a
clear
dictum
that
these
nations
so-called,
these
civilized
tribes
did
have
standing
to
file
a
suit
without
a
special
act
of
congress
authorizing
it.
there
were
of
course
dozens
of
cases
entitled
cherokee
nation
versus
united
states
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
up
to
that
time
and
that
was
1944,
that
still
leaves
some
time
between
then
and
the
time
this
suit
was
filed
20
years
later.
however,
it's
first
to
fact
that
the
value
of
this
property
was
not
apparent
until
the
discovery
of
gas
in
very
recent
years.
secondly
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
all
of
them
except
perhaps
one
and
the
one
is
entitled
cherokee
nation
versus
hitchcock,
the
then
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
cited
by
mr.
justice
black
in
that
opinion
and
the
creek
case
as
authority.
there
was
another
cited
which
is
really
not
good
a
precedent
because
it
was
filed
pursuant
to
special
act
terms.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
all
of
these
suits
with
that
possible
exception
were
filed
pursuant
to
specific
authorization
from
the
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
special
bills
were
passed.
usually
there
were
suits
in
court
of
claims.
i
may
say
even
this
suit
could
not
have
been
brought
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
for
the
consent
granted
by
oklahoma
or
a
waiver
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
don't
know
whether
oklahoma
was
at
all
times
willing
to
consent
to
the
suite
by
these
tribes.
finally,
i
should
say
in
fairness
that
the
tribes'
approach
the
department
of
interior
some
years
ago
seeking
to
have
the
united
states
file
the
suit
on
behalf
of
the
tribes
which
was
then
--
which
has
been
an
established
practice.
the
department
of
interior
did
not
refuse
to
do
so,
but
took
it's
time
in
processing
the
request
and
ultimately
the
tribes
brought
their
own
suits.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
for
a
moment
that
the
department
of
interior
and
the
department
of
justice
are
not
fully
in
support
of
the
petitioners
here
as
indeed
my
presence
indicates
and
the
government
appeared
likewise
in
the
courts
below
since
the
first
appearance.
going
back,
these
grants
were
in
no
sense,
as
though
they
were
grants
to
private
owners
of
even
large
estates.
these
were
cessions
made
by
treaty
with
what
were
considered
independent
nations
or
quasi-independent
nations.
there
were
recognitions
and
grants,
not
only
of
property
in
the
real
estate
sense,
but
a
political
power.
the
treaties
themselves
and
the
opinions
of
this
court
rendered
just
two
and
three
years
before
in
cherokee
nation
versus
georgia,
and
worcester
versus
georgia
by
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
indicated
to
what
extraordinary
extent
these
tribes,
these
civilized
tribes
were
independent
nations.
they
were
held
not
to
be
foreign
states,
but
they
were
held
in
every
other
respect
to
be
independent
political
sovereignties.
under
those
circumstances
and
considering
also
the
terminology
of
the
grants
which
i
remind
the
court
were
in
terms
of
a
fee
simple
title,
in
terms
of
a
permanent
home
for
these
tribes
of
indians
and
with
a
special
assurance
that
at
no
future
time
would
a
state
be
called
out
or
surround
them.
it
is
--
it
seems
to
us
that
one
cannot
realistically
suppose
that
there
was
any
intention
to
retain
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
state.
the
beds
of
the
navajo
rivers
that
might
exist
within
that
enormous
territory
now
ceded
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribes.
it
does
not
appear
why
the
united
states
would
have
wished
for
its
own
purposes
to
retain
the
bed
of
the
river.
it
did
retain,
as
it
always
does,
its
navigational
servitude,
its
right
to
use
the
river
as
a
notary
of
commerce.
it
had
an
interest
in
maintaining
fort
gibson
that
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
and
its
access
to
that
fort
was
of
course
a
matter
of
importance
but
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
white
because
the
creeks
do
not
have
land
bordering
on
any
navigable
portion
of
the
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
according
to
this
court's
opinion
on
brewer-elliot
in
260
u.s.,
the
court
there
accepted
the
findings
of
the
two
courts
below
that
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
was
just
above
fort
gibson,
at
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
and
of
the
arkansas
river
which
is
the
point
from
which
this
dispute
arises.
that
case
incidentally,
the
brewer-elliot
decision,
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
reserved
doctrine
under
which
beds
of
navigational
rivers
are
reserved
may
not
be
applicable
with
respects
to
these
grants
that
being
granted
to
the
cherokees
and
by
the
cherokees
to
the
osages.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
but
i'm
not
really
am
not
clear.
if
it
is
of
course
non-navigable,
there
wouldn't
be
any
claim
by
the
state.
it
would
simply
be
a
claim
as
between
the
two
tribes
and
i
frankly
don't
know
which
ways
it's
resolved.
i
think
there
the
patent
is
clear
however
that's
it's
the
north
bank
of
the
--
of
canadian
that's
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
cherokee
grant
resides
the
north
bank
of
the
canadian
and
i
think
the
choctaw
grant
is
not
that
specific,
it
simply
says
a
territory
between
the
canadian
and
the
red
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
terms
yes,
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
really
don't
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
informed
on
that
question
to
be
sure
of
my
answer,
that's
my
impression.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
red
river
in
this
court's
decision
in
oklahoma
versus
texas
was
adjudicated
to
belong
--
well,
to
be
outside
of
texas
and
to
be
within
oklahoma.
it
was
held
to
be
non-navigable
and
the
indian
allottees
were
held
to
own
the
bed
where
--
the
entire
bed
where
their
allotments
filled.
that
dispute
is
only
about
a
small
portion
of
the
red
river
which
was
in
what
was
called
the
least
district
of
the
choctaw
grant.
now,
even
in
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
applicable,
it
is
recognized
that
there's
an
exception
where
the
united
states
for
a
public
purpose
grants
the
bed
of
the
river,
does
not
reserve
it.
here,
the
public
purpose
is
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
eastern
seaboard
states
as
to
whom
the
united
states
have
promised
to
extinguish
indian
title
and
its
resulting
obligation
to
the
indian
tribes
to
find
a
new
home
for
them
and
to
maintain
the
peace
and
avoid
indian
wars.
all
of
those
important
public
purposes
were
determinative
in
having
the
government
settle
the
tribes
west
of
this
arkansas
land
and
in
the
way
that
gave
them
an
absolutely
protected
boundary
into
which
no
white
man
was
permitted
except
by
leave
of
the
governments
of
these
tribes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
think
even
there
mr.
justice
white,
there
would
be
an
argument
that
because
this
entire
area
have
been
carved
out
not
so
much
as
a
land
grant
but
as
a
political
grant
that
the
--
just
as
the
state
would
own
the
bed,
so
here
the
intention
was
that
these
tribes
as
nations
would
stand
in
the
shoes
of
a
state
with
all
of
the
same
rights.
if
there's
any
equal
footing
argument
here,
it's
that
the
nations
who
receive
these
territories
ought
to
stand
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
territories
created
from
the
louisiana
purchase
and
the
suggestion
that
oklahoma
is
being
treated
as
a
second
class
state
is
rather
out
of
place.
it's
the
indian
nations
that
are
being
treated
as
second
class
grantees
if
they
are
deprived
of
the
bed.
but
we
would
certainly
strain
to
avoid
a
result
which
would
leave
a
strip
of
land
in
the
middle
of
indian
country
reserved
from
those
grants
when
one
could
imagine
no
purpose
for
doing
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
a
sovereign
servitude
but
not
at
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no
more
than
when
a
state
is
created
out
of
the
louisiana
territory,
the
united
states
retains
its
navigational
servitude.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
that
is
--
that
is
an
aspect
of
sovereignty,
i
suppose,
that
certainly
the
united
states
retained
roughly
the
same
sovereignty
that
it
would
with
respect
to
the
state
carved
out
of
the
louisiana
territory
or
any
other
territory
of
the
united
states.
if
i
may
trespass
on
the
court's
time
for
a
moment,
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
the
suggestions
that
somehow
if
they
once
got
it,
they
subsequently
lost
the
bed
of
the
river.
i
think
oklahoma
is
hesitant
to
suggest
that
they
gave
it
up
because
that
would
amount
to
an
argument
that
they
did
so
only
by
duress.
it
being
perfectly
clear
that
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
agreed
to
allotment
only
under
pressures
from
the
congress
and
after
the
passage
of
the
curtis
act
as
to
the
proposition
that
they
have
ceased
to
be
nations
and
that
therefore
under
the
terms
of
the
grants,
there
was
reversion
to
the
united
states.
this
court's
decision
in
the
menominee
case
which
holds
that
a
tribe
remains
a
tribe
even
after
a
termination
act
has
been
passed
by
the
congress
would
seem
dispositive
there.
these
--
though
there
was
at
one
time
an
intention
to
abolish
the
tribes
and
end
their
tribal
community,
they
still
retain
tribal
property,
they
are
still
tribes.
they
do
so
in
some
rights
of
self-government
and
if
all
advance
it
would
be
unworthy
to
have
destroyed
the
nation
in
order
to
rob
it
of
its
property.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hesitate
to
detain
the
court
much
longer
in
these
cases
arguing
on
the
same
side
but
perhaps
i
can
perform
some
service
to
the
court
as
an
amicus
curiae
if
i
attempt
to
very
briefly
summarize
and
perhaps
simplify
the
issues
as
we
see
them.
the
first
fact
which
we
would
stress
in
this
case
is
that
here
we
have
clear
cut
conveyances
of
large
tracts
of
lands
to
these
three
indian
tribes,
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws,
together
with
cherokees
separately.
the
sequence
of
those
grants
seems
to
us
of
no
great
importance.
it
happens
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
treaties
the
choctaws
come
first
and
the
cherokee
is
second.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
patents,
it's
the
other
way
around.
the
important
thing
however
is
that
there
were
grants
in
fee
simple
to
these
tribes
of
very
large
tracts
adjacent
one
to
the
other
and
between
them,
entirely
surrounding
and
encompassing
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
but
the
fact
that
there's
a
conveyance
in
fee
simple
immediately
distinguishes
the
holt
state
bank
case
which
is
invoked
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
there,
there
was
no
conveyance
whatever
nor
was
there
even
a
setting
aside
of
the
portion
of
the
aboriginal
lands
of
the
chippewas
which
was
reserved
to
the
tribe.
those
reserved
lands,
well
lands
which
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
united
states
always
owned
in
--
always
had
the
title
to,
the
indians
simply
had
a
right
of
occupancy.
therefore
the
united
states
always
owned
the
beds
of
the
navigable
rivers
and
of
the
mud
lake
which
was
at
issue
in
the
holt
state
bank
case
and
there
was
no
act,
no
transaction
which
ever
changed
that
situation,
whereas
here,
there
is.
the
united
states
cedes
these
tracts
to
the
indian
tribes
and
the
burden
it
seems
to
us
is
on
the
other
side
to
show
why
the
beds
of
the
river
did
not
go
with
the
grants.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
would
be
a
--
we
could
make
the
same
argument
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
it
helps
us
here
that
the
river
is
entirely
enveloped
in
indian
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
such
situation
with
respect
to
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
in
this
case.
if
perhaps
your
honor
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
navigable
portion.
perhaps
though
the
physical
situation
ought
to
be
clarified.
once
again
referring
to
page
25
of
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
choctaw
nation,
to
the
rather
small
white
brief,
a
very
simplified
map
which
seems
to
me
presents
the
situation
as
clearly
as
it
can
be.
you'll
notice,
there's
a
triangle,
at
the
top
of
the
triangle,
fort
gibson.
on
the
right
hand
side
of
that
triangle
is
a
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
on
the
left
hand
side
of
that
triangle
coming
down
is
the
more
or
less
straight
line
which
represents
the
western
edge
of
the
cherokee
grant
and
at
the
south
is
a
portion
of
the
canadian
river.
now
that
triangle
is
part
of
the
cherokee
grant.
so
is
of
course
the
portion
indicated
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
creeks'
seminal
claim
begins
west
of
that
so-called
straight
line.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
white
that
triangle
belongs
to
the
cherokees.
therefore
the
cherokees
have
land
on
both
sides
of
the
arkansas
river.
that
triangle
south
of
fort
gibson
is
cherokee
land
as
is
what
is
north
and
east
of
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
non-navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
but
none
which
is
relevant
to
the
portion
of
the
river
which
is
in
controversy
here.
but
the
fact
that
this
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
between
fort
gibson
and
its
confluence
with
the
canadian
river
is
entirely
within
the
cherokee
grant,
hence
to
simplify
the
matter
in
that
here
we
at
least
we
need
not
talk
about
which
grant
came
first
and
whether
the
united
states
reserved
to
itself
the
portion
that
was
not
yet
granted
to
an
indian
tribe
and
yet
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
--
makes
the
same
argument
here
as
it
does
further
east.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
would
seem
to
be
right,
i
think.
anyway
from
fort
gibson
to
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
now
i
would
say
that
whether
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
first
grant
any
of
the
bed
was
granted
or
whether
all
of
it
was
granted
in
that
first
grant
and
or
the
second
grant
only
came
to
the
river's
edge
or
the
other
way
around
is
a
debate
as
between
the
two
tribes
that
need
not
concern
this
court,
that
its
not
presented
here
and
that
would
of
course
be
reached
in
the
event
the
indians
were
to
prevail
here.
i
should
say
that
the
cherokees'
only
claim
to
the
thread
where
the
river
is
the
boundary
between
them
whereas
the
choctaw
has
claimed
the
whole
of
the
bed,
but
we
certainly
take
no
position
as
to
who
is
right
or
wrong
in
that
debate
nor
should
this
court
at
this
time
concern
itself
with
that
intramural
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart
of
course
only
as
to
the
portion
east
of
the
confluence
of
the
arkansas
and
canadian
river
and
as
to
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
to
the
extent
that
the
bed
had
not
been
included
in
the
first
grant,
it
must
have
been
included
in
the
second
to
--
except
that
it
was
already
fully
included
in
the
first,
it
could
of
course
not
be
included
in
the
second.
the
languages
of
the
two
events
is
not
identical
and
is
simply
in
each
a
reference
to
the
river
as
a
boundary
without
indicating,
it
seems
to
us
in
any
clear
way
whether
it
goes
to
the
thread,
to
the
other
bank
or
stops
at
the
nearer
bank.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
don't
think
the
disposition
of
this
case
in
either
the
court's
below
turned
on
that
technical
reading
of
the
patent
or
of
the
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
can't
say
that
they
couldn't
believe
such
an
argument
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
raised
and
certainly
in
a
much
more
full
fledged
way
now
in
the
briefs
in
--
on
the
merits
in
this
court
than
it
was
before
and
really
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
evident
that
one
cannot
resolve
the
controversy
simply
by
looking
no
further
than
the
language
of
these
conveyances.
one
must
construe
them
because
they
are
ambiguous
in
terms
of
the
apparent
intent
of
the
conveyor
and
the
recipient.
and
it's
to
that
--
it's
on
that
basis,
the
court
of
appeal
disposed
of
this
case
and
to
that
extent,
we
agree
that
that's
the
correct
basis.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
no
quarrel
mr.
chief
justice
at
the
time
that
the
vendor,
the
united
states
had
full
on
incumbent
title.
whether
it
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
quite
so
but
it
is
our
intent
to
show
that
the
realities
then
prevailing
would
indicate
that
these
conveyances
ought
to
be
construed
so
as
to
include
and
not
exclude
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
in
these
large
grants
to
indian
tribes
in
what
was
then
thought
to
be
a
forever
more
indian
territory.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
or
either
or
both
grants
taken
together.
we
must
remember
that
these
grants
were
both
contemplated
at
the
time
either
one
was
finalized
because
they
had
both
had
prior
histories
in
the
prior
treaties
that
simply
without
finalizing
made
indications
that
this
lands
would
become
available
to
one
tribe
or
the
other.
as
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
i
had
said
that
the
conveyances
to
these
two
tribes
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaws
taken
together
encompassed
the
riverbed
of
the
arkansas
river.
in
one
instance
the
riverbed
or
the
river
was
entirely
surrounded
by
cherokee
land
in
the
other
portion
--
or
the
other
portion,
in
dispute
it
formed
the
boundary
between
the
territory
granted
to
those
two
tribes.
as
to
that
latter
portion,
the
suggestion
that
somehow
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
was
included
in
neither
grant
is
somewhat
comparable
to
what
maybe
a
suggestion
when
say
the
states
of
louisiana
or
mississippi
were
admitted
to
the
union
where
the
mississippi
river
is
the
boundary
between
them
and
because
the
acts
of
admission
in
each
case
read
to
the
river
or
up
the
river
or
down
the
main
channel
of
the
river
as
these
conveyances
do.
the
conclusion
were
reached
that
the
mississippi
river
were
included
neither
in
mississippi
nor
in
louisiana,
a
result
which
we
would
strain
to
avoid
because
it
obviously
makes
no
sense.
that
is
quite
comparable
to
the
situation
here.
we're
not
dealing
with
grants
--
small
grants
to
private
landowners
we
are
dealing
with
what
amount
to
large
territories
ceded
to
quasi-sovereign
tribes
then
defined
as
nations,
in
that
time
considered
quasi-independent.
the
treaties,
the
fact
that
we
dealt
with
them
by
treaties
of
course
indicates
that
approach
of
dealing
with
indian
tribes
as
independent
entities.
the
treaties
themselves
are
recognized,
powers
extensive
power
of
self-government
in
these
tribes.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
approach
to
reserve,
to
attempt
to
reserve,
to
wish
to
reserve,
to
have
any
interest
in
reserving
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
or
any
other
territory
within
the
area
ceded
except
only
as
the
united
states
might
have
some
special
reason
for
doing
so
such
as
maintaining
the
area
around
fort
gibson
in
the
middle
of
the
cherokee
grants
which
was
expressly
done.
so
here,
they
might
have
been
interest
in
the
united
states
in
reserving
a
right
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
and
that
can
be
read
into
this
grants
to
the
chapters
in
cherokees
but
of
course
the
navigational
servitude
which
appertains
to
the
united
states
in
all
states
does
not
carry
in
it
an
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
river
and
there
is
no
reason
to
so
read
it
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
precisely,
mr.
justice
black.
at
that
time,
it
was
not
known
that
the
bed
of
this
river
would
become
valuable.
there
was
therefore
no
reason
for
the
united
states
withhold
for
its
own
benefit
of
the
bed
of
this
river.
all
it
was
concerned
about
or
it
could
be
concerned
about
was
to
preserve
its
right
to
maintain
it
as
an
open
highway
of
commerce
and
as
a
way
of
access
to
fort
gibson
within
the
indian
territory
but
as
to
the
bed
there
was
no
reason
for
the
united
states
to
wish
to
retrieve
ownership.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
today,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
its
oil.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
this
controversy
arises
because
very
valuable
oil
deposits
have
been
discovered
in
the
bed
of
the
river
and
so
the
matter
becomes
an
important
practical
dispute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
the
practical
questions
mr.
justice
black.
now,
as
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
we
say
that
the
doctrine
has
no
application
here.
first,
we
point
out
that
it
hadn't
been
invented
yet
pollard
versus
hagan,
the
first
case
in
this
court
to
apply
that
rule
thought
from
inevitable
rule
was
some
years
after
these
grants
to
these
indian
tribes.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were.
they
certainly
were.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
white
but
they
could
be
--
they
said
it
were
cherokee
and
creek
lands
bordering
on
the
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
above
fort
gibson.
i
already
am
not,
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
i
think
true,
mr.
justice
white.
i
thought
it
was
agreed
by
all
parties
and
i
made
the
misspeaking
that
the
navigable
course
of
the
arkansas
river
ends
at
fort
gibson.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
cannot
answer.
perhaps,
one
of
the
other
counsel
will
know
--
will
know
better.
as
i
say,
the
equal
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
claim
oklahoma
claim
make
to
the
bed
of
the
river
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
the
only
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
never
included
in
any
grants
or
any
indian
in
which
event
it
still
belongs
to
the
united
states
or
still
did
at
the
time
of
--
well
i
suppose
it's
--
i
am
not
sure.
it
may
still
then
belong
to
the
united
states.
well,
never
having
been
ceded
to
the
state
expressly
but
when
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
put,
i'm
not
clear
whether
those
grants
were
on
as
a
categorically
feasible
grants.
i
am
clear
that
those
grant's
were
not
made
with
stipulation
which
is
quite
relevant
here
that
the
present
lands
would
never
under
any
circumstance
being
incorporated
within
the
state
and
that
they
will
it
in
perpetuity
as
a
permanent
home.
this
language
being
appropriate
precisely
because
these
tribes
had
been
so
often
shifted
westwood
that
it
was
appropriate
to
at
long
last
seem
to
be
guaranteeing
them
a
place
from
which
they
would
not
be
evicted,
though
in
the
end
they
were
evicted
from
oklahoma
as
well.
as
i
said,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
inappropriate
here,
first
because
it
haven't
been
device
yet
and
therefore
can
hardly
be
suppose
to
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
grantors
but
mostly
because
that
is
a
doctrine
which
is
--
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
future
state.
here
we
have
an
expressed
decoration
in
both
treaties
to
the
effect
that
never
will
a
state
be
created
in
this
territory
and
therefore
no
occasion
to
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state
that
will
never
come
into
existence
in
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
as
to
your
first
question,
the
tribe
retains
an
existence
and
does
now
have
tribal
property
as
oppose
to
the
form
of
property
which
has
been
subdivided
among
the
individual
regions
there
is
a
tribal
counsel,
there
is
a
tribal
government,
there
are
tribal
funds
which
are
administered
for
the
common
benefit
of
the
tribe,
some
of
those
for
school
purposes.
what
would
happen
and
how
the
indians
would
choose
to
appropriate
the
revenues
from
these
oil
lands
are
not
clear.
it
might
be
that
because
technically,
the
property
would
lie
in
trust
with
the
united
states
that
some
supervision
of
these
revenues
would
lie
with
the
department
of
interior.
that
the
question
frankly
hasn't
been
fully
explored
and
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
resolve,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
are,
as
i
understand
it
cherokee
and
choctaw
schools
maintained
with
tribal
funds
derived
from
other
common
tribal
property.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
that
they
do,
though
some
of
them
attend
the
state
schools.
they're
free
to
do
it
your
honor.
but
they
do
use
some
of
the
tribal
funds,
for
that
purpose,
sole
purpose.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white,
and
not
for
the
whole.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
really
two
arguments
made
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
order
to
claim
the
bed
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
which
is
in
dispute
here.
the
first
is
that
these
indian
tribes
never
obtained
title
to
the
bed.
the
second
is
that
if
they
did,
they
lost
it
at
some
subsequent
time.
as
to
the
first
proposition
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
would
say
--
well,
they
don't
press
these
arguments.
they
have
suggested
here
and
there.
i
take
it
that
they're
not
pressed
as
their
main
arguments,
“lost
by
voluntarily
relinquishment
in
the
1890's
just
prior
to
statehood,”
that
is
prior
to
oklahoma
statehood.
they
have
received
that
they
have
taken
from
them
or
that
they
gave
it
away
when
they
agreed
to
an
allotment
of
their
land
or
were
forced
to
allot
their
lands.
the
second
of
these
arguments
would
be
that
they
cease
to
exist
as
a
nation
and
therefore
under
the
terms
of
the
grants,
these
communal
tribal
lands
reverted
to
united
states
and
in
turn
inundate
to
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that
is
an
argument
which
barely
suggested
by
oklahoma
and
i
hope
not
seriously
pressed.
more
seriously,
i
think,
they
suggest
that
neither
tribe
the
choctaws,
chickasaws
together
nor
the
cherokees
ever
obtained
title
to
the
bed
of
the
river
and
i
make
two
arguments
in
that
respect.
the
first
is
that
as
a
technical
manner
conveyancing,
these
treaties
and
patents
did
not
embrace
the
bed
of
the
river.
the
second
is
that
even
if
the
patents
broadly
embrace
the
bed
that
was
an
implied
reservation
by
the
united
states
in
these
grants
for
the
benefit
of
some
future
state.
as
to
the
first
proposition,
i
think
what
is
most
noteworthy
when
one
traces
down
the
various
descriptions
and
the
various
treaties
and
the
various
patents
is
that
the
grant
to
the
cherokees
and
the
grants
to
the
choctaws
are
always
defined
one
with
relation
to
the
other.
the
boundary
between
them
is
spoken
of
as
common
corner,
the
cherokee
corner
or
the
choctaw
corner
at
the
extreme
downward
point
of
the
arkansas
river.
there
are
references
to
the
river
which
talk
about
down
the
main
channel
which
doesn't
sound
like
along
the
north
bank.
finally,
and
i
think
most
of
persuasive,
is
the
almost
unthinkable
proposition
that
in
grants
of
this
size
and
as
the
little
map
i
have
prepared
for
the
court
indicates,
the
whole
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
except
the
panhandle
was
granted
to
three
indian
tribes.
the
cherokees
at
the
north,
the
creeks
and
seminoles
in
the
center,
choctaws
and
chickasaws
at
the
bottom,
each
of
these
grants
is
of
a
huge
tract
of
land.
in
the
case
of
the
cherokees,
it's
an
approximately
14
million
acres,
roughly
three
times
the
size
of
maryland.
the
choctaw
and
the
chickasaw
grant
is
considerably
larger.
all
of
this
territory,
west
of
the
arkansas
boundary
was
intended
to
be
and
to
remain
indian
territory.
these
enormous
grants
to
what
were
then
described
as
nations
meant
to
remain
forever
as
quasi-independent,
quasi-sovereign
states.
it
is
unthinkable,
i
think,
that
the
riverbeds
were
meant
to
be
left
out
when
all
of
this
territory
west
of
the
line
was
confined
to
the
tribes
all
in
contiguous
grants.
much
the
same
considerations
weigh
against
the
second
argument
advanced
by
oklahoma,
which
is
that
the
united
states
impliedly
reserved
the
beds
even
though
they're
caught
within
the
description.
i
should
emphasize
that
in
one
instance,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
bed
of
the
river
is
caught
within
the
description
of
that
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
that
is
entirely
embraced
by
cherokee
lands
on
both
sides
which
runs
from
fort
gibson
to
the
confluence
of
the
arkansas
with
the
canadian
river.
now
the
notion
that
the
united
states
would
have,
in
this
instance,
reserve
to
itself
the
benefit
of
a
future
state,
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
insofar
as
it
was
navigable
is
at
odds
both
with
the
understanding
of
the
times.
first
of
all,
that
doctrine
had
not
yet
been
articulated
and
it's
only
several
years
later,
this
court
for
the
first
time
developed
that
proposition.
but
leaving
that
aside
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
do
not
take
a
position
with
respect
to
the
intramural
debate
as
between
the
two
tribes.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
description
is
ambiguous.
it
certainly
does
not
show
any
intent
to
exclude
the
bed
of
the
river.
as
to
which
of
the
two
tribes
has
the
better
claim
is
a
matter
which
i
should
think
this
court
would
leave
to
the
lower
courts
which
have
not
ruled
on
it
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
--
there
is
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
choctaws
claim
the
whole
of
it,
the
cherokees
claim
the
north
half
of
it.
obviously,
there's
an
overlapping
claim
here
which
i
don't
think
is
to
be
disposed
of
by
this
court.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
picking
up
from
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
let
me
say
broadly
that
the
realistic
situation
here
is
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
determine
that
all
lands
west
of
a
certain
boundary
that
ultimately
was
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
arkansas
should
be
indian
lands,
a
whole
enormous
territory
which
includes
present
oklahoma
and
some
other
lands.
subsequently,
it
was
determined
to
divide
that
acreage
between
these
several
tribes.
the
exact
descriptions
of
that
division
should
not
be
dispositive
as
to
whether
all
of
that
indian
country
was
then
meant
to
be
and
to
remain
an
indian
territory.
from
that
point
on,
from
the
1820's
on
and
later
when
this
territory
was
called
the
indian
territory,
nobody
ever
thought
that
any
portion
of
it
had
been
kept
back.
the
exact
boundaries
between
the
several
grants
were
matters
of
some
dispute.
some
of
the
grants
originally
were
overlapping,
were
found
to
be
overlapping
and
were
then
corrected,
but
the
general
picture
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
statement,
is
that
all
of
that
land
was
meant
to
be
indian
land
in
which
white
settlers
were
excluded
and
it
ought
not
to
be
dispositive
whether
the
coals
in
certain
surveys
exactly
match
or
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
here
that
the
descriptions
do
show
a
contiguous
boundary
between
the
cherokee
and
the
choctaw
grant
where
the
oklahoma
--
where
the
arkansas
river
is
the
boundary
between
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
dispute
as
between
the
tribes
of
oklahoma,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
it
was
always
there
from
the
point
when
oklahoma
became
a
state.
since
we
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
letter
from
the
interior
department
which
is
reprinted
at
the
back
of
our
brief
in
1908
indicates
that
at
that
time,
there
was
already
some
question
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
or
whether
the
tribes
own
the
bed.
at
that
time
it
was
simply
sand
and
gravel
removal,
it
was
not
oil
or
gas.
the
value
of
the
bed
at
that
time
i
suppose
was
minimal.
i
may
say
also
that
to
the
extent
that
these
tribes
are
taxed
with
not
having
brought
this
suit
earlier,
it
was
not
at
all
clear.
in
fact,
it
was
assumed
after
cherokee
nation
versus
georgia
that
these
tribes
have
no
standing
of
their
own
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
and
because
they
couldn't
bring
one
in
the
state
court
without
the
consent
of
the
state.
it
was
only
in
your
opinion
mr.
justice
black
in
the
creek
case
in
318
u.s.
decided
in
1944
that
for
the
very
first
time
it
was
said,
it
wasn't
a
holding,
it
was
a
dictum,
but
it
was
a
clear
dictum
that
these
nations
so-called,
these
civilized
tribes
did
have
standing
to
file
a
suit
without
a
special
act
of
congress
authorizing
it.
there
were
of
course
dozens
of
cases
entitled
cherokee
nation
versus
united
states
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
up
to
that
time
and
that
was
1944,
that
still
leaves
some
time
between
then
and
the
time
this
suit
was
filed
20
years
later.
however,
it's
first
to
fact
that
the
value
of
this
property
was
not
apparent
until
the
discovery
of
gas
in
very
recent
years.
secondly
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
all
of
them
except
perhaps
one
and
the
one
is
entitled
cherokee
nation
versus
hitchcock,
the
then
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
is
cited
by
mr.
justice
black
in
that
opinion
and
the
creek
case
as
authority.
there
was
another
cited
which
is
really
not
good
a
precedent
because
it
was
filed
pursuant
to
special
act
terms.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
all
of
these
suits
with
that
possible
exception
were
filed
pursuant
to
specific
authorization
from
the
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
special
bills
were
passed.
usually
there
were
suits
in
court
of
claims.
i
may
say
even
this
suit
could
not
have
been
brought
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
for
the
consent
granted
by
oklahoma
or
a
waiver
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
don't
know
whether
oklahoma
was
at
all
times
willing
to
consent
to
the
suite
by
these
tribes.
finally,
i
should
say
in
fairness
that
the
tribes'
approach
the
department
of
interior
some
years
ago
seeking
to
have
the
united
states
file
the
suit
on
behalf
of
the
tribes
which
was
then
--
which
has
been
an
established
practice.
the
department
of
interior
did
not
refuse
to
do
so,
but
took
it's
time
in
processing
the
request
and
ultimately
the
tribes
brought
their
own
suits.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
for
a
moment
that
the
department
of
interior
and
the
department
of
justice
are
not
fully
in
support
of
the
petitioners
here
as
indeed
my
presence
indicates
and
the
government
appeared
likewise
in
the
courts
below
since
the
first
appearance.
going
back,
these
grants
were
in
no
sense,
as
though
they
were
grants
to
private
owners
of
even
large
estates.
these
were
cessions
made
by
treaty
with
what
were
considered
independent
nations
or
quasi-independent
nations.
there
were
recognitions
and
grants,
not
only
of
property
in
the
real
estate
sense,
but
a
political
power.
the
treaties
themselves
and
the
opinions
of
this
court
rendered
just
two
and
three
years
before
in
cherokee
nation
versus
georgia,
and
worcester
versus
georgia
by
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
indicated
to
what
extraordinary
extent
these
tribes,
these
civilized
tribes
were
independent
nations.
they
were
held
not
to
be
foreign
states,
but
they
were
held
in
every
other
respect
to
be
independent
political
sovereignties.
under
those
circumstances
and
considering
also
the
terminology
of
the
grants
which
i
remind
the
court
were
in
terms
of
a
fee
simple
title,
in
terms
of
a
permanent
home
for
these
tribes
of
indians
and
with
a
special
assurance
that
at
no
future
time
would
a
state
be
called
out
or
surround
them.
it
is
--
it
seems
to
us
that
one
cannot
realistically
suppose
that
there
was
any
intention
to
retain
for
the
benefit
of
the
future
state.
the
beds
of
the
navajo
rivers
that
might
exist
within
that
enormous
territory
now
ceded
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribes.
it
does
not
appear
why
the
united
states
would
have
wished
for
its
own
purposes
to
retain
the
bed
of
the
river.
it
did
retain,
as
it
always
does,
its
navigational
servitude,
its
right
to
use
the
river
as
a
notary
of
commerce.
it
had
an
interest
in
maintaining
fort
gibson
that
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
and
its
access
to
that
fort
was
of
course
a
matter
of
importance
but
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
white
because
the
creeks
do
not
have
land
bordering
on
any
navigable
portion
of
the
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
according
to
this
court's
opinion
on
brewer-elliot
in
260
u.s.,
the
court
there
accepted
the
findings
of
the
two
courts
below
that
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
arkansas
river
was
just
above
fort
gibson,
at
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
and
of
the
arkansas
river
which
is
the
point
from
which
this
dispute
arises.
that
case
incidentally,
the
brewer-elliot
decision,
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
reserved
doctrine
under
which
beds
of
navigational
rivers
are
reserved
may
not
be
applicable
with
respects
to
these
grants
that
being
granted
to
the
cherokees
and
by
the
cherokees
to
the
osages.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
but
i'm
not
really
am
not
clear.
if
it
is
of
course
non-navigable,
there
wouldn't
be
any
claim
by
the
state.
it
would
simply
be
a
claim
as
between
the
two
tribes
and
i
frankly
don't
know
which
ways
it's
resolved.
i
think
there
the
patent
is
clear
however
that's
it's
the
north
bank
of
the
--
of
canadian
that's
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
cherokee
grant
resides
the
north
bank
of
the
canadian
and
i
think
the
choctaw
grant
is
not
that
specific,
it
simply
says
a
territory
between
the
canadian
and
the
red
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
terms
yes,
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
really
don't
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
informed
on
that
question
to
be
sure
of
my
answer,
that's
my
impression.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
red
river
in
this
court's
decision
in
oklahoma
versus
texas
was
adjudicated
to
belong
--
well,
to
be
outside
of
texas
and
to
be
within
oklahoma.
it
was
held
to
be
non-navigable
and
the
indian
allottees
were
held
to
own
the
bed
where
--
the
entire
bed
where
their
allotments
filled.
that
dispute
is
only
about
a
small
portion
of
the
red
river
which
was
in
what
was
called
the
least
district
of
the
choctaw
grant.
now,
even
in
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
applicable,
it
is
recognized
that
there's
an
exception
where
the
united
states
for
a
public
purpose
grants
the
bed
of
the
river,
does
not
reserve
it.
here,
the
public
purpose
is
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
eastern
seaboard
states
as
to
whom
the
united
states
have
promised
to
extinguish
indian
title
and
its
resulting
obligation
to
the
indian
tribes
to
find
a
new
home
for
them
and
to
maintain
the
peace
and
avoid
indian
wars.
all
of
those
important
public
purposes
were
determinative
in
having
the
government
settle
the
tribes
west
of
this
arkansas
land
and
in
the
way
that
gave
them
an
absolutely
protected
boundary
into
which
no
white
man
was
permitted
except
by
leave
of
the
governments
of
these
tribes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
think
even
there
mr.
justice
white,
there
would
be
an
argument
that
because
this
entire
area
have
been
carved
out
not
so
much
as
a
land
grant
but
as
a
political
grant
that
the
--
just
as
the
state
would
own
the
bed,
so
here
the
intention
was
that
these
tribes
as
nations
would
stand
in
the
shoes
of
a
state
with
all
of
the
same
rights.
if
there's
any
equal
footing
argument
here,
it's
that
the
nations
who
receive
these
territories
ought
to
stand
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
territories
created
from
the
louisiana
purchase
and
the
suggestion
that
oklahoma
is
being
treated
as
a
second
class
state
is
rather
out
of
place.
it's
the
indian
nations
that
are
being
treated
as
second
class
grantees
if
they
are
deprived
of
the
bed.
but
we
would
certainly
strain
to
avoid
a
result
which
would
leave
a
strip
of
land
in
the
middle
of
indian
country
reserved
from
those
grants
when
one
could
imagine
no
purpose
for
doing
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
a
sovereign
servitude
but
not
at
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no
more
than
when
a
state
is
created
out
of
the
louisiana
territory,
the
united
states
retains
its
navigational
servitude.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
that
is
--
that
is
an
aspect
of
sovereignty,
i
suppose,
that
certainly
the
united
states
retained
roughly
the
same
sovereignty
that
it
would
with
respect
to
the
state
carved
out
of
the
louisiana
territory
or
any
other
territory
of
the
united
states.
if
i
may
trespass
on
the
court's
time
for
a
moment,
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
the
suggestions
that
somehow
if
they
once
got
it,
they
subsequently
lost
the
bed
of
the
river.
i
think
oklahoma
is
hesitant
to
suggest
that
they
gave
it
up
because
that
would
amount
to
an
argument
that
they
did
so
only
by
duress.
it
being
perfectly
clear
that
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
agreed
to
allotment
only
under
pressures
from
the
congress
and
after
the
passage
of
the
curtis
act
as
to
the
proposition
that
they
have
ceased
to
be
nations
and
that
therefore
under
the
terms
of
the
grants,
there
was
reversion
to
the
united
states.
this
court's
decision
in
the
menominee
case
which
holds
that
a
tribe
remains
a
tribe
even
after
a
termination
act
has
been
passed
by
the
congress
would
seem
dispositive
there.
these
--
though
there
was
at
one
time
an
intention
to
abolish
the
tribes
and
end
their
tribal
community,
they
still
retain
tribal
property,
they
are
still
tribes.
they
do
so
in
some
rights
of
self-government
and
if
all
advance
it
would
be
unworthy
to
have
destroyed
the
nation
in
order
to
rob
it
of
its
property.
for
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
