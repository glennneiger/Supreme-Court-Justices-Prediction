that
which
all
i
have
does

this
will
get
the

and
that
will
depend

section
28
of
the
act
of
april
26,
1906.
i
am
still
reading
from
mr.
semple,
says
the
tribal
government
shall
be
continued
in
full
force
and
effect
for
all
the
purposes
authorized
by
law
unless
otherwise
provided
by
law.
but
in
fact,
the
legislative
branches
have
long
then
ceased
to
function.
the
tribal
laws
were
supplemented
by
the
act
of
april
28,
1904,
which
equipped
the
laws
of
arkansas
in
the
force
in
effect
for
indian
territory
as
to
indians,
freed
men
and
white
persons
alike.
now,
some
interest
has
been
expressed
as
to
the
present
status
of
the
indian
tribes
in
oklahoma
and
as
to
their
schooling.
we
have
--
this
is
common
knowledge,
which
counsel
for
choctaws
and
cherokees
know.
but
it
has
not
been
divorced,
so
we're
going
to
site
a
report,
house
report
number
2503
dated
december
15,
1952

seems
to

i
wouldn't

they
just
re-litigate
on
what
was
the
surface
of
the

what
is
it,
is
it
oil?
justice

well,
for

have
there
been

section
28
of
the
act
of
april
26,
1906.
i
am
still
reading
from
mr.
semple,
says
the
tribal
government
shall
be
continued
in
full
force
and
effect
for
all
the
purposes
authorized
by
law
unless
otherwise
provided
by
law.
but
in
fact,
the
legislative
branches
have
long
then
ceased
to
function.
the
tribal
laws
were
supplemented
by
the
act
of
april
28,
1904,
which
equipped
the
laws
of
arkansas
in
the
force
in
effect
for
indian
territory
as
to
indians,
freed
men
and
white
persons
alike.
now,
some
interest
has
been
expressed
as
to
the
present
status
of
the
indian
tribes
in
oklahoma
and
as
to
their
schooling.
we
have
--
this
is
common
knowledge,
which
counsel
for
choctaws
and
cherokees
know.
but
it
has
not
been
divorced,
so
we're
going
to
site
a
report,
house
report
number
2503
dated
december
15,
1952
but
seems
to
be
passed.

now?

black
i
wouldn't
suppose
they
just
re-litigate
on
what
was
the
surface
of
the
river.
what
is
it,
is
it
oil?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
for
what
purpose
can
the
indians
have
use
for
it
except
for
the
gas?
justice

black
for
what
the
purpose

black
the
bed
of
the

l.
black
have
there
been
any
opportunity
get
a
special
act
of
congress
passed
to
justice
black?
justice

were
passed?
justice

black
mr.

l.
black
where
do
these
indians
live?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
over
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
all
live
in
the
state
of
oklahoma?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
a
large
number
of
them
left
oklahoma.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
live
on
this
particular
land
that
was
deeded
to
them?
justice

l.
black
i
don't
suppose
it
would
do
us
any
harm.

the
total
--
justice

l.
black
--
since

l.
black
suppose
i'd
--
suppose
the
court
were
to
decide
this
that
oklahoma
didn't
own
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by

never
been
in
possession
of
any
of
the
land.
justice
