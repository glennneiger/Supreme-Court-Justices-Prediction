mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
i
do.
it
depends
upon
of
course
what
degree
of
blood
you're
referring
to
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
an
estimated
of
a
total
of
a
quarter
or
more
indian
blood;
25,000
cherokees,
20,000
chickasaws,
16,000
choctaws
and
i
will
say
this
mr.
justice
white,
the
figures
vary
with
what
the
authorities
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
i
don't
have
those
figures
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
25,000
of
a
quarter
blood
or
more,
about
5,100
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
the
choctaws
about
16,000
of
quarter
or
more,
about
5,100
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
3,200
with
about
1,400
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
two-and-a-half
million,
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
all
over,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
all
over
the
state
of
oklahoma.
primarily
in
the
eastern
part
from
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir.
the
figures
that
i've
been
referring
to
are
residents
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
we
hope
not
sir,
but
i
think
the
figures
that
i'm
referring
to
are
figures
compiled
from
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
you
see
most
of
the
land
has
been
allotted
to
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe,
most
of
it
sometime
ago.
there's
still
some
land
held
in
commoners
or
restricted
land,
but
the
vast
majority
of
it
was
allotted
to
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe.
my
part
in
this
effort
today
is
somewhat
limited.
i
come
to
you
to
--
i
hope
make
a
little
clearer
what
the
controversy
at
least
from
our
view
is
really
all
about
and
will
take
but
merely
a
few
minutes
of
our
time
at
which
time
i
will
defer
to
my
colleague,
mr.
kirk
who
carried
the
argument
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
appearance
before
this
court.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
have
--
i
would
like
to
request
permission
of
the
court
to
use
a
photograph
which
is
merely
--
which
is
not
part
of
the
record,
but
is
in
the
matter
of
being
informative
which
i
think
will
assist
the
court
in
understanding
the
controversy.
i'd
like
to
use
it
the
same
manner
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
thank
you
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir.
this
is
an
aerial
photograph
taken
off
the
arkansas
river
bed
very
near
fort
smith
as
you
can
see.
this
picture
was
taken
in
1963.
its
only
purpose
is
to
help
the
court
in
understanding
that
which
the
court
dealt
into
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
appearance
here
in
which
you
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black
asked
about
earlier
today
and
that
is
what
the
controversy
all
about
and
you
may
note
that
in
this
picture
there
is
an
area
called
old
channel.
that's
a
large
ox-bow
that
was
created
by
having
the
channels
straightened
through
the
efforts
of
the
army
engineers
which
is
referred
to
as
new
channel.
now,
this
particular
photograph
is
a
picture
of
a
place
called
bradens
bend.
it's
near
fort
smith.
it
contains
about
5,000
acres
of
very
valuable
land.
the
--
we
have
engineered
it
and
we
estimate
that
the
land
which
has
been
uncovered
as
a
result
of
straightening
the
riverbed
for
which
rights
of
way
were
acquired
and
not
in
controversy
here.
the
surface
of
this
uncovered
land
is
valued
somewhere
around
$7
million.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
sir?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
oh!
yes
sir.
you
mean
in
the
old
channel?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
covered
for
so
many
years,
there
have
been
some
drainage
problems
but
a
great
majority
of
it
is
useful
for
farming.
now,
it's
within
the
flood
banks
you
see
and
on
occasion
of
very
high
water
very
well
maybe
inundated
at
some
future
time,
at
which
time
it
takes
a
couple
of
years
for
it
to
aerate
and
to
be
usable
again
but
at
the
present
time
that
that
you
see
they
refer
to
as
the
old
channel
can
be
farmed
and
is
highly
productive.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that
is
what
the
controversy
is
all
about.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
no
sir,
the
new
channel
was
acquired
by
purchase.
it's
not
an
issue
here,
but
when
they
diverted
the
river
into
the
new
channel
then
this
land
was
uncovered
and
is
part
of
the
controversy
here.
as
you
know,
we're
talking
about
from
fort
gibson
down
to
the
arkansas
line
which
is
approximately
95
miles
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
and
that
land
is
the
primary
object
of
the
controversy
or
land
similar
to,
there
are
three
of
those.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that
is
correct.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
--
the
mineral
rights
also
are
in
controversy.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
now
in
--
with
regard
to
that
that
question
was
raised
at
the
last
argument
and
we
have
since
taken
steps
to
determine
what's
at
stake
there
and
the
mineral
interest
which
are
presently
under
lease
by
various
oil
companies
have
been
valued
at
a
million
dollars.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
at
a
million
dollars,
the
surface
value
is
$7
million.
the
riverbed
in
this
navigable
portion
is
about
95
miles
long
and
contains
41,000
acres
roughly
during
the
length
of
that
95
miles
and
that
which
is
primarily
at
issue
here
is
the
lower
17
miles
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
the
only
area
of
the
river
bed
that
has
any
value
for
oil
and
gas
discovery
purposes
and
secondly,
this
is
the
area
where
the
land
flattened
out
and
the
riverbed
straight
all
over
the
countryside.
farther
back
up
north,
it's
contained
within
rather
narrow
boundaries
and
there
is
nothing
particularly
at
issue.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
this
case?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
no
sir.
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
exercised
dominion
over
the
riverbed
since
statehood,
but
issued
--
but
sold
oil
and
gas
leases
starting
in
1910
and
the
latest
having
been
in
1966.
sand
and
gravel
leases
were
sold
by
the
states
starting
in
1912
and
for
practically
every
year
through
and
including
1969.
this
case
was
filed
in
december
of
1966.
earlier
in
that
year,
the
state
sold
oil
and
gas
leases
valued
well
for
approximately
$500,000.00.
since
statehood,
the
revenue
from
the
riverbed
has
been
a
total
of
about
$600,000.00,
so
you
can
see
the
largest
amount
of
course
is
very
recent.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that's
a
total
amount.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
$600,000.00.
that
money
is
in
the
school
land
commission
permanent
fund,
the
revenue
from
which
is
distributed
to
all
of
the
public
schools
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
i
suspect
we'd
have
to
return
that
money
to
various
entities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
very
reason
why
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
are
here.
we
have
made
a
contractual
arrangement
with
regard
to
the
sale
of
these
leases.
we
have
the
largest
economic
interest
that
being
the
surface
and
that's
the
main
purpose
for
which
we
appear
is
in
defense
of
those
interests.
the
litigants,
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
have
no
reservation
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
they
have
no
tribal
system
of
schools.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
tribal
schools
they
did
have
were
transferred
to
the
department
of
interior
in
1906
and
the
only
tribal
school
to
my
knowledge
and
that
our
research
could
reveal
in
existence
at
the
present
time
is
a
vocational
school
in
tonkawa
which
is
a
very
recent
origin.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
action
have
never
been
in
possession,
physical
possession
of
the
land
because
the
land
was
only
recently
uncovered.
therefore,
it's
not
a
case
of
having
people
--
scarce
on
the
land
were
going
to
have
it
removed
and
physically
and
etcetera.
these
are
the
facts
which
the
court
inquired
into
on
the
case
of
our
last
oral
argument
and
i
thought
it
would
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
to
know
really
what
the
physical
facts
were
and
the
basis
of
the
controversy.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
physical
possession
of
the
riverbed
because
the
riverbed
was
riverbed
until
the
engineers
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
until
it
was
uncovered.
that
concludes
my
remarks.
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
to
them.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
i
do.
it
depends
upon
of
course
what
degree
of
blood
you're
referring
to
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
an
estimated
of
a
total
of
a
quarter
or
more
indian
blood;
25,000
cherokees,
20,000
chickasaws,
16,000
choctaws
and
i
will
say
this
mr.
justice
white,
the
figures
vary
with
what
the
authorities
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
i
don't
have
those
figures
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
25,000
of
a
quarter
blood
or
more,
about
5,100
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
the
choctaws
about
16,000
of
quarter
or
more,
about
5,100
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
3,200
with
about
1,400
full
bloods.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
two-and-a-half
million,
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
all
over,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
all
over
the
state
of
oklahoma.
primarily
in
the
eastern
part
from
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir.
the
figures
that
i've
been
referring
to
are
residents
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
we
hope
not
sir,
but
i
think
the
figures
that
i'm
referring
to
are
figures
compiled
from
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
you
see
most
of
the
land
has
been
allotted
to
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe,
most
of
it
sometime
ago.
there's
still
some
land
held
in
commoners
or
restricted
land,
but
the
vast
majority
of
it
was
allotted
to
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe.
my
part
in
this
effort
today
is
somewhat
limited.
i
come
to
you
to
--
i
hope
make
a
little
clearer
what
the
controversy
at
least
from
our
view
is
really
all
about
and
will
take
but
merely
a
few
minutes
of
our
time
at
which
time
i
will
defer
to
my
colleague,
mr.
kirk
who
carried
the
argument
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
appearance
before
this
court.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
have
--
i
would
like
to
request
permission
of
the
court
to
use
a
photograph
which
is
merely
--
which
is
not
part
of
the
record,
but
is
in
the
matter
of
being
informative
which
i
think
will
assist
the
court
in
understanding
the
controversy.
i'd
like
to
use
it
the
same
manner
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
thank
you
sir.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir.
this
is
an
aerial
photograph
taken
off
the
arkansas
river
bed
very
near
fort
smith
as
you
can
see.
this
picture
was
taken
in
1963.
its
only
purpose
is
to
help
the
court
in
understanding
that
which
the
court
dealt
into
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
appearance
here
in
which
you
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black
asked
about
earlier
today
and
that
is
what
the
controversy
all
about
and
you
may
note
that
in
this
picture
there
is
an
area
called
old
channel.
that's
a
large
ox-bow
that
was
created
by
having
the
channels
straightened
through
the
efforts
of
the
army
engineers
which
is
referred
to
as
new
channel.
now,
this
particular
photograph
is
a
picture
of
a
place
called
bradens
bend.
it's
near
fort
smith.
it
contains
about
5,000
acres
of
very
valuable
land.
the
--
we
have
engineered
it
and
we
estimate
that
the
land
which
has
been
uncovered
as
a
result
of
straightening
the
riverbed
for
which
rights
of
way
were
acquired
and
not
in
controversy
here.
the
surface
of
this
uncovered
land
is
valued
somewhere
around
$7
million.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
sir?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
oh!
yes
sir.
you
mean
in
the
old
channel?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
covered
for
so
many
years,
there
have
been
some
drainage
problems
but
a
great
majority
of
it
is
useful
for
farming.
now,
it's
within
the
flood
banks
you
see
and
on
occasion
of
very
high

very
well
maybe
inundated
at
some

at
which

it

a

but
at
the
present

that
that
you
see
they
refer
to
as
the
old
channel
can
be
farmed
and
is
highly
productive.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that
is
what
the
controversy
is
all
about.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
no
sir,
the
new
channel
was
acquired
by
purchase.
it's
not
an
issue
here,
but
when
they
diverted
the
river
into
the
new
channel
then
this
land
was
uncovered
and
is
part
of
the
controversy
here.
as
you
know,
we're
talking
about
from
fort
gibson
down
to
the
arkansas
line
which
is
approximately
95
miles
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
and
that
land
is
the
primary
object
of
the
controversy
or
land
similar
to,
there
are
three
of
those.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that
is
correct.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
--
the
mineral
rights
also
are
in
controversy.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
now
in
--
with
regard
to
that
that
question
was
raised
at
the
last
argument
and
we
have
since
taken
steps
to
determine
what's
at
stake
there
and
the
mineral
interest
which
are
presently
under
lease
by
various
oil
companies
have
been
valued
at
a
million
dollars.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
at
a
million
dollars,
the
surface
value
is
$7
million.
the
riverbed
in
this
navigable
portion
is
about
95
miles
long
and
contains
41,000
acres
roughly
during
the
length
of
that
95
miles
and
that
which
is
primarily
at
issue
here
is
the
lower
17
miles
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
the
only
area
of
the
river
bed
that
has
any
value
for
oil
and
gas
discovery
purposes
and
secondly,
this
is
the
area
where
the
land
flattened
out
and
the
riverbed
straight
all
over
the
countryside.
farther
back
up
north,
it's
contained
within
rather
narrow
boundaries
and
there
is
nothing
particularly
at
issue.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
this
case?
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
no
sir.
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
exercised
dominion
over
the
riverbed
since
statehood,
but
issued
--
but
sold
oil
and
gas
leases
starting
in
1910
and
the
latest
having
been
in
1966.
sand
and
gravel
leases
were
sold
by
the
states
starting
in
1912
and
for
practically
every
year
through
and
including
1969.
this
case
was
filed
in
december
of
1966.
earlier
in
that
year,
the
state
sold
oil
and
gas
leases
valued
well
for
approximately
$500,000.00.
since
statehood,
the
revenue
from
the
riverbed
has
been
a
total
of
about
$600,000.00,
so
you
can
see
the
largest
amount
of
course
is
very
recent.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
that's
a
total
amount.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
$600,000.00.
that
money
is
in
the
school
land
commission
permanent
fund,
the
revenue
from
which
is
distributed
to
all
of
the
public
schools
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
i
suspect
we'd
have
to
return
that
money
to
various
entities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
very
reason
why
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
are
here.
we
have
made
a
contractual
arrangement
with
regard
to
the
sale
of
these
leases.
we
have
the
largest
economic
interest
that
being
the
surface
and
that's
the
main
purpose
for
which
we
appear
is
in
defense
of
those
interests.
the
litigants,
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
and
chickasaws
have
no
reservation
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
they
have
no
tribal
system
of
schools.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
tribal
schools
they
did
have
were
transferred
to
the
department
of
interior
in
1906
and
the
only
tribal
school
to
my
knowledge
and
that
our
research
could
reveal
in
existence
at
the
present
time
is
a
vocational
school
in
tonkawa
which
is
a
very
recent
origin.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
action
have
never
been
in
possession,
physical
possession
of
the
land
because
the
land
was
only
recently
uncovered.
therefore,
it's
not
a
case
of
having
people
--
scarce
on
the
land
were
going
to
have
it
removed
and
physically
and
etcetera.
these
are
the
facts
which
the
court
inquired
into
on
the
case
of
our
last
oral
argument
and
i
thought
it
would
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
to
know
really
what
the
physical
facts
were
and
the
basis
of
the
controversy.
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
physical
possession
of
the
riverbed
because
the
riverbed
was
riverbed
until
the
engineers
--
mr.
g.
t.
blackenship
yes
sir,
until
it
was
uncovered.
that
concludes
my
remarks.
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
to
them.
