mr.
peyton
ford
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
and
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
cherokees.
i
had
hoped
to
avoid
any
interest
to
say
conflict
between
the
tribes.
all
that
i
would
say
to
that
question
very
briefly
is
one,
we
have
received
the
first
patent
of
these
lands
in
1838,
signed
by
president
van
buren
and
in
that
we
are
given
the
land
dents
down
the
canadian
river
on
the
north
to
a
junction
with
the
arkansas
river
and
dents
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas.
and
that
is
all
we
claim
as
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
in
that
connection
i
might
briefly
show
this
map
to
your
honors
and
that
if
you
will
notice
between
the
95th
and
96th
parallel
on
the
lands
marked
to
the
cherokees,
i
don't
know
what
that
section
is,
that
the
arkansas
river
runs
completely
through
the
land
of
the
cherokees,
i.e.
it's
bordered
on
both
sides
by
the
grant
through
the
cherokees
in
the
treaty
of
new
echota
later
--
of
1835
in
the
later
patent,
1838.
it's
after
it
comes
to
that
line
that
there's
a
border
between
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaw.
that
map
asserted
one
other
purpose
too.
if
you
will
look
on
the
the
appendix,
page,
roman
page
xiii
of
the
respondents'
brief,
they
have
reproduced
the
map
from
mr.
royce
who
is
an
authority,
perhaps
the
authority.
it's
appendix
8,
aren't
we?
no,
appendix
7,
roman
xiii,
the
respondents'
brief.
justice
douglas
has
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
they
have
a
fact,
similarly
of
the
map
reproduced
in
which
you
will
notice
the
--
there
--
to
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas,
there's
a
very
fine
black
line,
runs
from
call
6,
5,
4;
7
is
the
bottom
which
would
appear
to
indicate
that
that
is
the
grant
to
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas
and
that
the
cherokees
or
the
indian
tribes
went
no
further.
we
have
reproduced
an
exact
reproduction
of
royce's
map
which
indicates
merely
a
change
in
the
color
of
the
line
for
the
river
on
that
part
of
the
arkansas
where
the
cherokee
lands
meets
the
arkansas
at
the
95th
parallel,
approximately.
in
other
words,
that's
a
mere
color,
the
line
of
the
river,
their
map
would
indicate
that
the
--
and
i
just
don't
want
the
court
mislead
that
the
dark
line
would
be
the
boundary
of
the
grant
for
the
cherokee.
i
would
like
briefly
to
give
a
little
background
of
the
cherokee
nation
that
prior
to
the
revolution,
its
principal
lands
were
north
carolina,
virginia
and
georgia
that
consisted
approximately
some
80
million
acres.
they
had
absolute
dominion
over
this.
following
the
revolution,
there
was
a
treaty
of
hopewell
entered
into
in
1785
where
the
cherokees
then
swore
allegiance
to
the
u.s.
and
the
u.s.
government
in
turn
agreed
to
protect
the
tribe
and
recognize
its
sovereignty
to
all
of
those
lands.
not
too
long
after
that
that
the
conflict
begun
between
the
white
settlers
and
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws
and
the
creeks.
the
southern
indians
had
became
five
civilized
tribes.
they
were
forced
from
virgin
--
north
carolina,
virginia,
principally
into
georgia.
at
that
time
georgia
passed
laws
in
effect
providing
that
they
could
enjoy
no
rights
that
if
any
man
or
white
man
was
found
upon
their
land,
that
he
--
that
they
had
to
have
permission
of
the
state
of
georgia.
following
this
marshall
opinion
in
worcester
came
down
in
which
he
clearly
recognized
the
sovereign
of
the
tribe
set
aside
although
georgia
heeded
and
they
find
in
--
with
somewhat
certainty
saying
that
the
cherokees
had
sovereignty
over
their
tribal
lands,
that
they
had
control
of
the
traffic
over
the
tennessee
river.
that
they
enjoyed
all
the
rights
of
the
river
that
the
white
man
would
have
to
get
their
permission
in
effect
to
use
the
river
and
the
--
even
in
face
of
the
court's
recognition
of
these
rights
and
certainly
the
cherokees
were
not
going
to
accept
less
if
they
went
west
than
what
they
had
in
georgia.
and
even
after
marshall
spoke,
the
courts
and
the
executive
continued
complete
harassment
of
all
these
southern
indian
tribes.
first,
the
cherokees
moved
to
arkansas
in
1870
which
became
known
as
the
old
settlers
and
that
was
in
exchange
of
land
to
move
to
arkansas,
but
arkansas
was
not
satisfied
with
the
indians.
there
was
again
the
conflict
between
the
whites
and
the
indians.
so
following
that,
there
was
a
treaty
executed
in
1828
between
the
cherokees
and
the
government.
after
the
arkansas
whites
had
again
insisted
that
they
move
further
west
and
this
treaty
in
effect
without
detail
moved
the
old
settlers
into
arkansas
along
the
old
settler
cherokees
into
the
lands
west
of
arkansas
which
became
indian
territory
along
with
the
other
indians
that
were
further
east
in
georgia
and
generally
the
treaty
granted
the
same
rights,
all
of
these
treaties
of
1817
and
1828
and
1825.
it
provided
that
this
land
was
to
be
as
mr.
kile
has
said,
“their
permanent
home,
it
was
never
to
be
encroached
upon
by
any
territory
or
state.”
it
granted
further
and
which
one
--
i
think
one
indian
commissioner
in
which
--
in
their
speeches
to
cherokees
trying
to
get
them
to
sign
the
treaty
of
new
echota
which
shortly
followed
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
which
was
a
treaty
for
the
choctaw
that
this
was
an
awful,
that
they
were
getting
fee
simple
title
and
as
he
expressed
it,
they
were
getting
white
man's
title
for
the
first
time
and
this
was
the
only
title
ever
issued
to
any
indians
and
they
were
confined
to
the
five
civilized
tribes
that
ultimately
settled
in
indian
territory.
the
rest
of
the
title
were
aboriginal
titles
which
gave
them
the
right
of
reservation
and
occupancy
and
so
forth
and
now
they
could
be
given
a
clear
promise
of
how
they
could
be
given
a
more
complete
jurisdiction
over
their
territory
is
beyond
me.
and
they
agreed
to
possess
to
the
cherokees
some
7,000
acres
of
land
within
this
grant,
i
mean
7
million,
excuse
me,
which
show
--
they
started
out
with
80,
it's
not
in
exactly
an
excessive
grant.
they
also
agreed
by
the
treaties
to
issue
the
patent
i
have
previously
referred
to,
the
patent
granted
this
land
in
fee
simple.
they
gave
them
white
man's
title
and
it
was
described
by
meats
and
bounds
and
encompassed
a
whole
grant.
certainly
the
united
states
didn't
intend
to
exclude
a
meandering
stream
running
through
this
grant
unless
they
had
chosen
to
say
so
and
this
people
knew
how
to
draft
instruments.
they
excluded
the
fort
gibson,
they
excluded
post
roads,
they
excluded
certain
plains
that
would
be
available
to
all
indian
tribes.
now
with
that
brief
history,
i'd
like
to
go
back
and
then
to
this
pollock
case
which
is
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
--
i
might
answer
this
shortly
this
way.
in
1898,
192,
the
so-called
curtis
act,
passed
the
196,
i
guess
you'd
say
the
enabling
act
was
passed,
but
those
acts
of
congress
at
that
time
made
allotments
to
the
given
indians
or
at
the
time
--
mr.
peyton
ford
oh!
except
tribal
lands
which
includes
which
includes
certain
townships,
schools,
other
lands
that
are
owned
in
common
by
the
tribe
outside
of
the
river.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
there's
a
known
history
of
peace
of
the
alien
nation
and
what
a
full
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
now
still
on
that
pre-allotment,
there
were
some
question
of
--
mr.
peyton
ford
there
are
approximately
--
are
you
correct?
mr.
peyton
ford
42,000.
mr.
peyton
ford
are
these
--
there
is
some
--
i
think
7,000
full
bloods.
if
you
take
the
--
speak
the
native
language,
many
of
them
don't
speak
english,
if
you
take
the
descendants
of
them,
they'd
run
about
a
hundred
thousand
and
there
were
approximately
nine
judicial
districts
under
their
tribal
government
which
is,
i
mean,
when
they
had
enjoyed
that
from
sovereignty
before
they
became
citizens.
mr.
peyton
ford
well
now,
they
live
on
their
individually
owned
lands.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
i'm
saying
subject
to
certain
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
of
their
counsel,
they
still
enjoy
sovereignty
under
the
acts
passed
by
congress.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
that
that
a
river
or
any
common
held
land
as
long
as
they
exist
to
be
a
tribe
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
shall
revert
to
the
united
states.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yeah,
i
mean,
you've
got
fee
simple
title
as
any
other
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
and
subject
to
certain
tribal
jurisdictions.
it's
still
a
tribal
council,
a
chief,
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
the
council
is
made
up
of
the
former
old
judicial
districts
before
statehood.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
some
of
them.
mr.
peyton
ford
there's
a
tribe
for
instance
have
a
working
now
on
a
--
through
the
chief
of
the
tribe,
i
mean
the
general
counsel
of
the
tribe,
the
chief
(inaudible)
general
counsel
which
as
a
mr.
earl
boyd
appears
on
the
improvement
of
the
housing
and
enjoying
the
public
housing
provisions
and
i
might
add
in
concluding
that
at
this
point,
that
this
action
was
first
brought
by
mr.
earl
boyd
pierce
as
general
counsel
for
the
cherokees
and
it
was
after
this
that
the
choctaws
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
action.
we
brought
an
action
for
counting
oklahoma,
a
counterclaimed
for
the
suit
to
acquire
a
title.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
and
vocation
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir
and
vocational
effort.
all
the
tribal
funds
came
down
the
so-called
outlet
case
had
been
devoted
to
the
common
efforts
of
the
tribe
and
the
funds
that
we
hoped
to
receive
if
there'd
be
any,
from
the
arkansas
river
will
be
so
usable.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
your
honor
and
while
the
court
has
some
questions
to
ask
me,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
background
of
this
case
has
been
fully
covered
except
i
would
like
briefly
refer
to
the
so-called
louisiana
purchase
of
1883.
there
has
been
great
weight
placed
upon
that
by
the
respondents
in
that
their
interpretation
of
that
purchase
is
that
it
was
purchased
for
the
purpose
of
the
formation
of
future
states
and
covered
by
the
louisiana
purchase.
article
iii
of
that
purchase
and
that's
the
only
reference
that
provides
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
area
that
is
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
shall
be
--
they
shall
enjoy
their
freedom,
their
religion,
their
constitutional
rights
that
the
federal
government
would
afford
them
hand
that
the
inhabitants
perhaps
at
some
future
date
might
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
there
was
no
reference
to
the
creation
of
specific
states
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
it's
--
that
is
red,
does
that
help
you
and
i
have
a
short
reply
brief.
mr.
peyton
ford
that
i
would
recommend
to
your
honor
merely
because
of
its
brevity.
mr.
peyton
ford
now,
the
only
thing
having
disposed
of
the
louisiana
purchase
briefly
rather
than
to
recite
school
boy
history
that
jefferson
was
severely
attacked
by
purchasing
louisiana
as
an
executive.
to
add
on
he
had
doubts
in
his
own
mind
and
due
correspondence
are
indicators
he
thought
a
constitutional
amendment
was
necessary
to
enact
this
territory.
he
was
apparently
dissuaded
on
that
decision,
so
the
treaty
was
affirmed
24/7,
i
think
on
christmas
eve
1903,
i
mean
1803,
if
i
drop
a
century.
but
the
interesting
part
of
that
is
in
1802,
georgia
made
a
cession
pact
ceding
part
of
their
land
right
following
that
to
the
osages
and
return
for
a
certain
land.
then
in
1808,
the
osages
began
a
negotiation
with
treaty,
ratified
in
1810.
but
in
1809,
the
cherokees
called
upon
jefferson
or
they
petitioned
him
in
regard
to
the
way
they
were
being
treated
and
so
forth
and
their
possible
move
to
the
west
and
this
also
was
in
between
the
negotiations
with
the
osage
treaty
and
ratification.
then
in
1909,
jefferson
said,
gave
his
blessings
and
said
to,
“my
children
go
forth
and
seek
this
land”
and
directed
them
to
the
arkansas
and
white
rivers
and
said
the
higher
the
better
which
incorporates
part
of
the
land
that
is
in
contention
today.
now
with
reference
to
the
treaties,
the
1835
treaties
in
effect
incorporates,
i'm
speaking
of
cherokees,
the
treaty
of
1817,
of
1833
and
1835.
in
brewer
v.
elliot,
the
court
clearly
spoke
that
the
louisiana
purchase
could
not
intervene
where
a
tribe
was
granted
a
fee
simple
title.
of
course,
in
cherokee
tobacco,
it
was
held
that
a
treaty
may
suspend
a
prior
act
of
congress
and
an
act
of
congress
may
suspend
the
treaty.
by
later
treaties
that
the
louisiana
purchase
had
any
validity,
it
certainly
was
not
advocated,
but
modified
by
the
subsequent
treaty.
but
the
thing
that
we're
trying
to
construe
in
this
case
in
my
mind
is
a
clear
language
of
the
treaty
prescribed
in
the
1833
treaty
adopted
in
the
1935
treaty
and
the
patent
that
was
adopted
in
1938
and
the
language
in
the
treaty
so
far
as
the
land
covered
is
consistent
with
the
patent,
that
position.
and
there
are
case
after
case,
creek
case
and
i
think
holden
v.
joy
and
several
other
cases
of
this
court
that
holds
that
we
did
get
title
in
fee
simple
for
these
five
civilized
tribes;
choctaw,
cherokees,
creek,
seminoles,
chickasaw.
now,
as
to
the
conveyance,
it
was
a
simple
conveyance
and
as
holmes
pointed
out
in
the
fleming
case,
215
u.s.
that
the
united
states
would
choose
to
use
any
language
it
wanted
to,
but
it
chose
a
simple
language
of
conveyance
that
the
average
citizen
would
understand.
mr.
peyton
ford
in
my
brief?
mr.
peyton
ford
fleming
is
not
cited
but
it's
215
--
mr.
peyton
ford
of
holmes?
mr.
peyton
ford
it's
fleming
v.
mccurtain,
it's
not
cited
in
the
brief
but
its
295
u.s.
i've
forgotten
the
language.
he
also
in
that
case
spoken
to
the
cessation
of
these
tribes
and
said
the
congress
has
spoken,
as
a
simple
answer
to
it,
and
were
still
in
existence
or
any
act
of
congress
including
the
act
of
1894,
of
1902,
of
1906,
of
1952
and
of
1962
and
as
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
shively
v.
bowlby,
was
decided
in
1845.
there
was
a
trust
expressly
created
between
virginia
and
georgia
prior
to
that
time
to
form
the
state
of
alabama.
and
the
united
states
attempted
to
grant
land
to
a
private
party
after
statehood.
in
shively
v.
bowlby
and
of
course,
that
engrasped
it
for
so-called
public
purpose
exception,
but
before
the
court
agrees
to
that
and
it's
pointed
out
in
their
reply
brief.
in
every
case,
from
shively
v.
bowlby
to
holt,
the
case
is
decided
upon
the
facts
that
territorial
status
existing,
that
there
was
a
government
in
existence
prior
to
status.
indian
territory
was
never
a
territory
as
such
other
than
as
you
would
speak
with
territory
covering
certain
lands.
oklahoma
territory
did
enjoy
territory
status.
indian
territory
did
not
and
never
became
a
territory
of
the
united
states.
and
i
think
the
public
purpose
in
this
is
so
obvious
that
it
hardly
needs
requisites.
the
removal
of
the
indian
which
is
an
absolute
necessity,
as
the
compact
of
1802
with
georgia
which
indicates
the
public
purpose.
the
power
of
congress
to
convey
this
land
is
clear
and
simple
and
the
so-called
argument
that
the
tribe
might
at
sometime
cease
then
as
was
pointed
out
in
early
days
in
a
letter
of
one
of
the
indian
commissioners
in
holden
v.
joy,
i
think,
and
it's
simply
an
escheat
provision.
we
cease,
the
land
goes
back.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
there
is
as
any
river,
it
has
certain
agricultural
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well
it's
a
--
i
think
mr.
kirk
in
his
previous
argument
said
it
was
oil
and
i
think
it
was
gas
--
mr.
peyton
ford
i
think
it
was
gas.
mr.
peyton
ford
no,
no,
i
don't
think,
that's
for
the
court
to
decide
anyway,
but
the
principal
production
is
gas
i
think
instead
of
oil.
now
mr.
kirk
is
far
better
informed
in
that
subject
than
i
am.
mr.
peyton
ford
huh?
mr.
peyton
ford
they
could
use
the
revenue.
mr.
peyton
ford
they
could
use
the
revenue
derived
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
if
that
particular
bed
was
productive
of
oil,
gas
--
mr.
peyton
ford
it
happens
to
be
gas,
do
i
have
any
more
time.
mr.
peyton
ford
i'll
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
i
hope
you
won't
turn
the
court
and
engineer,
we
currently
have,
so
i
wish
that
you
could
compare
the
calls
of
the
survey
and
the
patent
done
by
the
cherokee
and
they
read
the
same
in
reverse.
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
there's
a
difference
between
47
and
53
degrees;
it
might
have
around
the
three.
we
have
never
claimed
the
half
the
river.
it's
clearly
stated
in
the
patent
and
it's
not
inconsistent
with
the
treaty.
two,
just
to
three
in
alabama
v.
texas
in
speaking
of
disposal
of
the
public
lands
and
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
the
concurring
opinion
said
specifically,
united
states
has
power
to
dispose
of
it's
public
lands
under
the
power
--
under
the
so
called
equal
footing
doctrine
and
it's
not
intended
to
equate
the
states
on
economic
basis,
but
on
a
political
basis.
each
state
can't
hope
to
have
it,
either
new
york
or
manhattan
or
gold
or
silver.
that's
not
the
purpose
and
read
as
late
as
that
said.
the
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
specific
attention
to
the
enabling
act
of
oklahoma
which
is
cited
on
page
26
of
our
brief
and
the
oklahoma
constitution
which
specifically
provides
that
these
indian
tribes
will
be
protected
in
the
possession
of
their
land.
and
the
previous
act
which
is
referred
to
by
mr.
kirk
in
the
court
of
law
as
extinguishing
the
tribe
is
simply
without
meaning.
the
court
so
far
as
this
map
is
concerned
then
without
relationship
to
what
value
there
is,
i
don't
know.
certainly,
on
february
the
25th
in
the
state
of
arkansas
v.
tennessee
met
and
answered
the
same
question
concerning
[inaudible]
accretion
or
erosion
whether
it
be
by
natural
or
artificial
means.
the
cherokees
are
an
existing
tribe.
they
have
some
41,000
enrolled,
4,000
full
bloods
and
a
total
of
descendants
of
100,000.
the
money
that
we
have
derived
from
any
recovery
in
these
cases
outside
of
the
per
capita
distributions
to
the
indians,
not
only
in
the
so-called
outlet
case,
but
in
many
other
cases
that
mr.
pear
participated
then
has
gone
in
trust
for
the
indians
and
is
used
either
for
rehabilitation,
higher
education
and
various
vocable
projects.
any
questions?
when
you
said
three
minutes,
i'm
trying
to
obey.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
and
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
cherokees.
i
had
hoped
to
avoid
any
interest
to
say
conflict
between
the
tribes.
all
that
i
would
say
to
that
question
very
briefly
is
one,
we
have
received
the
first
patent
of
these
lands
in
1838,
signed
by
president
van
buren
and
in
that
we
are
given
the
land
dents
down
the
canadian
river
on
the
north
to
a
junction
with
the
arkansas
river
and
dents
down
the
main
channel
of
the
arkansas.
and
that
is
all
we
claim
as
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
in
that
connection
i
might
briefly
show
this
map
to
your
honors
and
that
if
you
will
notice
between
the
95th
and
96th
parallel
on
the
lands
marked
to
the
cherokees,
i
don't
know
what
that
section
is,
that
the
arkansas
river
runs
completely
through
the
land
of
the
cherokees,
i.e.
it's
bordered
on
both
sides
by
the
grant
through
the
cherokees
in
the
treaty
of
new
echota
later
--
of
1835
in
the
later
patent,
1838.
it's
after
it
comes
to
that
line
that
there's
a
border
between
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaw.
that
map
asserted
one
other
purpose
too.
if
you
will
look
on
the
the
appendix,
page,
roman
page
xiii
of
the
respondents'
brief,
they
have
reproduced
the
map
from
mr.
royce
who
is
an
authority,
perhaps
the
authority.
it's
appendix
8,
aren't
we?
no,
appendix
7,
roman
xiii,
the
respondents'
brief.
justice
douglas
has
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
they
have
a
fact,
similarly
of
the
map
reproduced
in
which
you
will
notice
the
--
there
--
to
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas,
there's
a
very
fine
black
line,
runs
from
call
6,
5,
4;
7
is
the
bottom
which
would
appear
to
indicate
that
that
is
the
grant
to
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas
and
that
the
cherokees
or
the
indian
tribes
went
no
further.
we
have
reproduced
an
exact
reproduction
of
royce's
map
which
indicates
merely
a
change
in
the
color
of
the
line
for
the
river
on
that
part
of
the
arkansas
where
the
cherokee
lands
meets
the
arkansas
at
the
95th
parallel,
approximately.
in
other
words,
that's
a
mere
color,
the
line
of
the
river,
their
map
would
indicate
that
the
--
and
i
just
don't
want
the
court
mislead
that
the
dark
line
would
be
the
boundary
of
the
grant
for
the
cherokee.
i
would
like
briefly
to
give
a
little
background
of
the
cherokee
nation
that
prior
to
the
revolution,
its
principal
lands
were
north
carolina,
virginia
and
georgia
that
consisted
approximately
some
80
million
acres.
they
had
absolute
dominion
over
this.
following
the
revolution,
there
was
a
treaty
of
hopewell
entered
into
in
1785
where
the
cherokees
then
swore
allegiance
to
the
u.s.
and
the
u.s.
government
in
turn
agreed
to
protect
the
tribe
and
recognize
its
sovereignty
to
all
of
those
lands.
not
too
long
after
that
that
the
conflict
begun
between
the
white
settlers
and
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
and
the
chickasaws
and
the
creeks.
the
southern
indians
had
became
five
civilized
tribes.
they
were
forced
from
virgin
--
north
carolina,
virginia,
principally
into
georgia.
at
that
time
georgia
passed
laws
in
effect
providing
that
they
could
enjoy
no
rights
that
if
any
man
or
white
man
was
found
upon
their
land,
that
he
--
that
they
had
to
have
permission
of
the
state
of
georgia.
following
this
marshall
opinion
in
worcester
came
down
in
which
he
clearly
recognized
the
sovereign
of
the
tribe
set
aside
although
georgia
heeded
and
they
find
in
--
with
somewhat
certainty
saying
that
the
cherokees
had
sovereignty
over
their
tribal
lands,
that
they
had
control
of
the
traffic
over
the
tennessee
river.
that
they
enjoyed
all
the
rights
of
the
river
that
the
white
man
would
have
to
get
their
permission
in
effect
to
use
the
river
and
the
--
even
in
face
of
the
court's
recognition
of
these
rights
and
certainly
the
cherokees
were
not
going
to
accept
less
if
they
went
west
than
what
they
had
in
georgia.
and
even
after
marshall
spoke,
the
courts
and
the
executive
continued
complete
harassment
of
all
these
southern
indian
tribes.
first,
the
cherokees
moved
to
arkansas
in
1870
which
became
known
as
the
old
settlers
and
that
was
in
exchange
of
land
to
move
to
arkansas,
but
arkansas
was
not
satisfied
with
the
indians.
there
was
again
the
conflict
between
the
whites
and
the
indians.
so
following
that,
there
was
a
treaty
executed
in
1828
between
the
cherokees
and
the
government.
after
the
arkansas
whites
had
again
insisted
that
they
move
further
west
and
this
treaty
in
effect
without
detail
moved
the
old
settlers
into
arkansas
along
the
old
settler
cherokees
into
the
lands
west
of
arkansas
which
became
indian
territory
along
with
the
other
indians
that
were
further
east
in
georgia
and
generally
the
treaty
granted
the
same
rights,
all
of
these
treaties
of
1817
and
1828
and
1825.
it
provided
that
this
land
was
to
be
as
mr.
kile
has
said,
“their
permanent
home,
it
was
never
to
be
encroached
upon
by
any
territory
or
state.”
it
granted
further
and
which
one
--
i
think
one
indian
commissioner
in
which
--
in
their
speeches
to
cherokees
trying
to
get
them
to
sign
the
treaty
of
new
echota
which
shortly
followed
the
treaty
of
dancing
rabbit
which
was
a
treaty
for
the
choctaw
that
this
was
an
awful,
that
they
were
getting
fee
simple
title
and
as
he
expressed
it,
they
were
getting
white
man's
title
for
the
first
time
and
this
was
the
only
title
ever
issued
to
any
indians
and
they
were
confined
to
the
five
civilized
tribes
that
ultimately
settled
in
indian
territory.
the
rest
of
the
title
were
aboriginal
titles
which
gave
them
the
right
of
reservation
and
occupancy
and
so
forth
and
now
they
could
be
given
a
clear
promise
of
how
they
could
be
given
a
more
complete
jurisdiction
over
their
territory
is
beyond
me.
and
they
agreed
to
possess
to
the
cherokees
some
7,000
acres
of
land
within
this
grant,
i
mean
7
million,
excuse
me,
which
show
--
they
started
out
with
80,
it's
not
in
exactly
an
excessive
grant.
they
also
agreed
by
the
treaties
to
issue
the
patent
i
have
previously
referred
to,
the
patent
granted
this
land
in
fee
simple.
they
gave
them
white
man's
title
and
it
was
described
by
meats
and
bounds
and
encompassed
a
whole
grant.
certainly
the
united
states
didn't
intend
to
exclude
a
meandering
stream
running
through
this
grant
unless
they
had
chosen
to
say
so
and
this
people
knew
how
to
draft
instruments.
they
excluded
the
fort
gibson,
they
excluded
post
roads,
they
excluded
certain
plains
that
would
be
available
to
all
indian
tribes.
now
with
that
brief
history,
i'd
like
to
go
back
and
then
to
this
pollock
case
which
is
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
--
i
might
answer
this
shortly
this
way.
in
1898,
192,
the
so-called
curtis
act,
passed
the
196,
i
guess
you'd
say
the
enabling
act
was
passed,
but
those
acts
of
congress
at
that
time
made
allotments
to
the
given
indians
or
at
the
time
--
mr.
peyton
ford
oh!
except
tribal
lands
which
includes
which
includes
certain
townships,
schools,
other
lands
that
are
owned
in
common
by
the
tribe
outside
of
the
river.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
there's
a
known
history
of
peace
of
the
alien
nation
and
what
a
full
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
now
still
on
that
pre-allotment,
there
were
some
question
of
--
mr.
peyton
ford
there
are
approximately
--
are
you
correct?
mr.
peyton
ford
42,000.
mr.
peyton
ford
are
these
--
there
is
some
--
i
think
7,000
full
bloods.
if
you
take
the
--
speak
the
native
language,
many
of
them
don't
speak
english,
if
you
take
the
descendants
of
them,
they'd
run
about
a
hundred
thousand
and
there
were
approximately
nine
judicial
districts
under
their
tribal
government
which
is,
i
mean,
when
they
had
enjoyed
that
from
sovereignty
before
they
became
citizens.
mr.
peyton
ford
well
now,
they
live
on
their
individually
owned
lands.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
i'm
saying
subject
to
certain
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
of
their
counsel,
they
still
enjoy
sovereignty
under
the
acts
passed
by
congress.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
act
that
that
a
river
or
any
common
held
land
as
long
as
they
exist
to
be
a
tribe
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
shall
revert
to
the
united
states.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yeah,
i
mean,
you've
got
fee
simple
title
as
any
other
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
and
subject
to
certain
tribal
jurisdictions.
it's
still
a
tribal
council,
a
chief,
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
the
council
is
made
up
of
the
former
old
judicial
districts
before
statehood.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
some
of
them.
mr.
peyton
ford
there's
a
tribe
for
instance
have
a
working
now
on
a
--
through
the
chief
of
the
tribe,
i
mean
the
general
counsel
of
the
tribe,
the
chief
(inaudible)
general
counsel
which
as
a
mr.
earl
boyd
appears
on
the
improvement
of
the
housing
and
enjoying
the
public
housing
provisions
and
i
might
add
in
concluding
that
at
this
point,
that
this
action
was
first
brought
by
mr.
earl
boyd
pierce
as
general
counsel
for
the
cherokees
and
it
was
after
this
that
the
choctaws
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
action.
we
brought
an
action
for
counting
oklahoma,
a
counterclaimed
for
the
suit
to
acquire
a
title.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
and
vocation
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir
and
vocational
effort.
all
the
tribal
funds
came
down
the
so-called
outlet
case
had
been
devoted
to
the
common
efforts
of
the
tribe
and
the
funds
that
we
hoped
to
receive
if
there'd
be
any,
from
the
arkansas
river
will
be
so
usable.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
your
honor
and
while
the
court
has
some
questions
to
ask
me,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
background
of
this
case
has
been
fully
covered
except
i
would
like
briefly
refer
to
the
so-called
louisiana
purchase
of
1883.
there
has
been
great
weight
placed
upon
that
by
the
respondents
in
that
their
interpretation
of
that
purchase
is
that
it
was
purchased
for
the
purpose
of
the
formation
of
future
states
and
covered
by
the
louisiana
purchase.
article
iii
of
that
purchase
and
that's
the
only
reference
that
provides
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
area
that
is
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
france
shall
be
--
they
shall
enjoy
their
freedom,
their
religion,
their
constitutional
rights
that
the
federal
government
would
afford
them
hand
that
the
inhabitants
perhaps
at
some
future
date
might
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
there
was
no
reference
to
the
creation
of
specific
states
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
it's
--
that
is
red,
does
that
help
you
and
i
have
a
short
reply
brief.
mr.
peyton
ford
that
i
would
recommend
to
your
honor
merely
because
of
its
brevity.
mr.
peyton
ford
now,
the
only
thing
having
disposed
of
the
louisiana
purchase
briefly
rather
than
to
recite
school
boy
history
that
jefferson
was
severely
attacked
by
purchasing
louisiana
as
an
executive.
to
add
on
he
had
doubts
in
his
own
mind
and
due
correspondence
are
indicators
he
thought
a
constitutional
amendment
was
necessary
to
enact
this
territory.
he
was
apparently
dissuaded
on
that
decision,
so
the
treaty
was
affirmed
24/7,
i
think
on
christmas
eve
1903,
i
mean
1803,
if
i
drop
a
century.
but
the
interesting
part
of
that
is
in
1802,
georgia
made
a
cession
pact
ceding
part
of
their
land
right
following
that
to
the
osages
and
return
for
a
certain
land.
then
in
1808,
the
osages
began
a
negotiation
with
treaty,
ratified
in
1810.
but
in
1809,
the
cherokees
called
upon
jefferson
or
they
petitioned
him
in
regard
to
the
way
they
were
being
treated
and
so
forth
and
their
possible
move
to
the
west
and
this
also
was
in
between
the
negotiations
with
the
osage
treaty
and
ratification.
then
in
1909,
jefferson
said,
gave
his
blessings
and
said
to,
“my
children
go
forth
and
seek
this
land”
and
directed
them
to
the
arkansas
and
white
rivers
and
said
the
higher
the
better
which
incorporates
part
of
the
land
that
is
in
contention
today.
now
with
reference
to
the
treaties,
the
1835
treaties
in
effect
incorporates,
i'm
speaking
of
cherokees,
the
treaty
of
1817,
of
1833
and
1835.
in
brewer
v.
elliot,
the
court
clearly
spoke
that
the
louisiana
purchase
could
not
intervene
where
a
tribe
was
granted
a
fee
simple
title.
of
course,
in
cherokee
tobacco,
it
was
held
that
a
treaty
may
suspend
a
prior
act
of
congress
and
an
act
of
congress
may
suspend
the
treaty.
by
later
treaties
that
the
louisiana
purchase
had
any
validity,
it
certainly
was
not
advocated,
but
modified
by
the
subsequent
treaty.
but
the
thing
that
we're
trying
to
construe
in
this
case
in
my
mind
is
a
clear
language
of
the
treaty
prescribed
in
the
1833
treaty
adopted
in
the
1935
treaty
and
the
patent
that
was
adopted
in
1938
and
the
language
in
the
treaty
so
far
as
the
land
covered
is
consistent
with
the
patent,
that
position.
and
there
are
case
after
case,
creek
case
and
i
think
holden
v.
joy
and
several
other
cases
of
this
court
that
holds
that
we
did
get
title
in
fee
simple
for
these
five
civilized
tribes;
choctaw,
cherokees,
creek,
seminoles,
chickasaw.
now,
as
to
the
conveyance,
it
was
a
simple
conveyance
and
as
holmes
pointed
out
in
the
fleming
case,
215
u.s.
that
the
united
states
would
choose
to
use
any
language
it
wanted
to,
but
it
chose
a
simple
language
of
conveyance
that
the
average
citizen
would
understand.
mr.
peyton
ford
in
my
brief?
mr.
peyton
ford
fleming
is
not
cited
but
it's
215
--
mr.
peyton
ford
of
holmes?
mr.
peyton
ford
it's
fleming
v.
mccurtain,
it's
not
cited
in
the
brief
but
its
295
u.s.
i've
forgotten
the
language.
he
also
in
that
case
spoken
to
the
cessation
of
these
tribes
and
said
the
congress
has
spoken,
as
a
simple
answer
to
it,
and
were
still
in
existence
or
any
act
of
congress
including
the
act
of
1894,
of
1902,
of
1906,
of
1952
and
of
1962
and
as
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
shively
v.
bowlby,
was
decided
in
1845.
there
was
a
trust
expressly
created
between
virginia
and
georgia
prior
to
that
time
to
form
the
state
of
alabama.
and
the
united
states
attempted
to
grant
land
to
a
private
party
after
statehood.
in
shively
v.
bowlby
and
of
course,
that
engrasped
it
for
so-called
public
purpose
exception,
but
before
the
court
agrees
to
that
and
it's
pointed
out
in
their
reply
brief.
in
every
case,
from
shively
v.
bowlby
to
holt,
the
case
is
decided
upon
the
facts
that
territorial
status
existing,
that
there
was
a
government
in
existence
prior
to
status.
indian
territory
was
never
a
territory
as
such
other
than
as
you
would
speak
with
territory
covering
certain
lands.
oklahoma
territory
did
enjoy
territory
status.
indian
territory
did
not
and
never
became
a
territory
of
the
united
states.
and
i
think
the
public
purpose
in
this
is
so
obvious
that
it
hardly
needs
requisites.
the
removal
of
the
indian
which
is
an
absolute
necessity,
as
the
compact
of
1802
with
georgia
which
indicates
the
public
purpose.
the
power
of
congress
to
convey
this
land
is
clear
and
simple
and
the
so-called
argument
that
the
tribe
might
at
sometime
cease
then
as
was
pointed
out
in
early
days
in
a
letter
of
one
of
the
indian
commissioners
in
holden
v.
joy,
i
think,
and
it's
simply
an
escheat
provision.
we
cease,
the
land
goes
back.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
there
is
as
any
river,
it
has
certain
agricultural
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well
it's
a
--
i
think
mr.
kirk
in
his
previous
argument
said
it
was
oil
and
i
think
it
was
gas
--
mr.
peyton
ford
i
think
it
was
gas.
mr.
peyton
ford
no,
no,
i
don't
think,
that's
for
the
court
to
decide
anyway,
but
the
principal
production
is
gas
i
think
instead
of
oil.
now
mr.
kirk
is
far
better
informed
in
that
subject
than
i
am.
mr.
peyton
ford
huh?
mr.
peyton
ford
they
could
use
the
revenue.
mr.
peyton
ford
they
could
use
the
revenue
derived
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
if
that
particular
bed
was
productive
of
oil,
gas
--
mr.
peyton
ford
it
happens
to
be
gas,
do
i
have
any
more
time.
mr.
peyton
ford
i'll
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
i
hope
you
won't
turn
the
court
and
engineer,
we
currently
have,
so
i
wish
that
you
could
compare
the
calls
of
the
survey
and
the
patent
done
by
the
cherokee
and
they
read
the
same
in
reverse.
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
there's
a
difference
between
47
and
53
degrees;
it
might
have
around
the
three.
we
have
never
claimed
the
half
the
river.
it's
clearly
stated
in
the
patent
and
it's
not
inconsistent
with
the
treaty.
two,
just
to
three
in
alabama
v.
texas
in
speaking
of
disposal
of
the
public
lands
and
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
the
concurring
opinion
said
specifically,
united
states
has
power
to
dispose
of
it's
public
lands
under
the
power
--
under
the
so
called
equal
footing
doctrine
and
it's
not
intended
to
equate
the
states
on
economic
basis,
but
on
a
political
basis.
each
state
can't
hope
to
have
it,
either
new
york
or
manhattan
or
gold
or
silver.
that's
not
the
purpose
and
read
as
late
as
that
said.
the
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
specific
attention
to
the
enabling
act
of
oklahoma
which
is
cited
on
page
26
of
our
brief
and
the
oklahoma
constitution
which
specifically
provides
that
these
indian
tribes
will
be
protected
in
the
possession
of
their
land.
and
the
previous
act
which
is
referred
to
by
mr.
kirk
in
the
court
of
law
as
extinguishing
the
tribe
is
simply
without
meaning.
the
court
so
far
as
this
map
is
concerned
then
without
relationship
to
what
value
there
is,
i
don't
know.
certainly,
on
february
the
25th
in
the
state
of
arkansas
v.
tennessee
met
and
answered
the
same
question
concerning
[inaudible]
accretion
or
erosion
whether
it
be
by
natural
or
artificial
means.
the
cherokees
are
an
existing
tribe.
they
have
some
41,000
enrolled,
4,000
full
bloods
and
a
total
of
descendants
of
100,000.
the
money
that
we
have
derived
from
any
recovery
in
these
cases
outside
of
the
per
capita
distributions
to
the
indians,
not
only
in
the
so-called
outlet
case,
but
in
many
other
cases
that
mr.
pear
participated
then
has
gone
in
trust
for
the
indians
and
is
used
either
for
rehabilitation,
higher
education
and
various
vocable
projects.
any
questions?
when
you
said
three
minutes,
i'm
trying
to
obey.
