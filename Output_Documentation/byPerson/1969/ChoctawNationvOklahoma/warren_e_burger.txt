mr.

would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
--
the
acoustics
are
less
prefect
here.
chief

warren
e.
burger
i
believe
(voice

maps
for

here,
is
that
correct
or
someone
has?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
would
you
give
us
some
idea
as
how
we
can
make
use
of
this?
can
you
relate
the
factual
background
to
the
map
which
has
been
distributed
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
have
some
problems
with
that
when
you
and
the
cherokees
come
to
settle
your
problems
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
that
ever
comes
about,
won't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
must
not
a
court
in
reaching
that
problem
also
bear
in
mind
the
historical
background
of
coming
from
the
colonial
times
of
reservation,
of
the
title
to
the
bed
of
all
navigable
waters,
isn't
that
part
of
the
total
equation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
we
accept
your
argument,
mr.
kile,
would
that
mean
that
if
the
indian
tribes
controlled
both
banks
and
the
bed,
forgetting
for
a
moment
which
tribe
claimed
which
part
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
they
could
exact
a
toll
for
example
for
boats
using
that
navigable
stream?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
we
apply
literally
your
argument
to
what
the
indians
had
a
reason
to
believe,
the
indians
may
have
thought
they
were
going
to
have
control
of
that
navigable
stream,
under
that
language
of
that
treaty
as
i
read
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
other
citizens
other
than
the
united
states,
would
they
be
able
to
use
that
navigable
water
freely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
subject
to
any
limitation
by
the
indian
tribes?
chief
justice
warren
e.

i'm
not
sure
what
that
signal
meant,
we
have
a
confusing
signal
here.
i

mr.

chief

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
depend
in
part
on
the
status
of
the
convey
--
the
vendor's
title
at
the
time
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
put
it
this
way,
what
--
what
the
vendor
conveyed
out
at
the
time
he
had
this
full
title.
if
he
conveyed
out
to
the
banks
only
on
the
first
transfer,
you
have
one
result
and
if
he
conveyed
to
the
far
bank,
you
have
another
result,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
both
the

is
that
it?
chief

warren
e.

i
think

mr.

chief

claiborne,
excuse
me.
you're
finishing
your
answer
(voice

in
your
submission
yesterday
you
post
that
at
least
that
as
i
understood
it
that
the
indian
tribes
gave
up
and
yielded
land
in
georgia
and
south
carolina
in
the
eastern
interior
states
in
exchange
for
this
land,
i
suppose
,they
surrendered
all
rights
of
every
character
to
subsurface
minerals
and
oils
in
those
eastern
lands,
is
that
correct?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.
claiborne.
mr.
kirk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
something
you
said
to
mr.
justice
black
and
you
said
the
land
and
by
that
i
assume,
you
mean
the
land
under
the
bed
of
the
river,
the
land
of
the
riverbed
is
worth
more
than
any
estimated
value
of
subsurface
products.
chief

e.

is
that
in

chief

chief

i
should

it
would
be.
chief

you
say
it's

it's
a
very
substantial

chief
