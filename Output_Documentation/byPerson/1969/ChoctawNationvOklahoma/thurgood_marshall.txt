justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
didn't
use
it
prior
to
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
past
four
years
there
has
been
a
big
jump
in
this
game?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
when
the
indians
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
decided
they
were
interested
in
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
than
the
right
of
the
federal
government
over
the
navigable
stream,
what
is
the
difference
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
between
navigable
and
a
non-navigable
stream?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
the
state
also
takes
jurisdiction
of
the
non-navigable
stream?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
you
say
that
the
state
that
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
red
river.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
has
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
particular
area
of
the
choctaw
nation,
no
base
still
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
only
the
riparian
owners
but
they
this
results
as
the
treaty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
the
provision
of
the
treaty
that
they
shall
not
give
any
of
this
to
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
part
of
the
treaty
would
say
none
of
these
grants
shall
be
able
to
be
given
to
a
state.
can
you
say
that
in
the
treaty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
the
fact
that
they
didn't
object
mean
that
they
consent
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
the
court
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
indian's
position
that
land
they
left
had
all
these
rivers
and
everything
on
it
and
in
ways
to
be
assumed
that
what
the
government
gave
them
was
the
equivalent
of
what
they
gave
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
their
position,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
conveyed
property
in
fee
simple?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
as
to
this
land,
they
had
land
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
they
had
fee
simple
to
everything
but
the
riverbed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
respectfully
say
it
is
not
what
i
was
asking
you.
your
argument
was
as
i
understood
it
and
i
now
ask
you
is
that
your
argument?
then
where
the
river
was
in
the
middle
of
piece
of
the
property
that
the
nation
was
given
fee
simple
of
everything
but
the
river
bank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
we
spell
that
out,
it
leads
the
river
by
the
mile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
river
bottom
is
not
navigable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
not
now,
that
river
bottom
is
not
the
bottom
of
a
navigable
route.
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
it
was
one
where
there
were
miles
of
land
that
was
just
land
and
could
be
farmed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
you
look
at
it
as
the
time
it
was
granted.
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
bed
of
the
navigable
river?
justice
thurgood
marshall
according
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
now
that
it's
now
worth
something
to
the
state,
the
land
but
not
the
river
now
belongs
to
the
state.
you
didn't
mind
the
board,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
says
that
they
are
not
as
of
today
nations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
show
that
they
are
not
tribes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
are
tribes.
why
don't
they
have
a
right
to
maintain
this
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
claim
you
are
making
on
that
particular
point
that
they
don't
have
reservations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
citizens
and
office
holders
out
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
over
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
go
to
schools
like
other
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
former
chief
justice
of
court
of
appeals,
judge
templar
was
a
cherokee.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
also
have
the
position
of
the
united
states
as
stated
by
the
solicitor
general
as
of
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
other
language,
“over
to
the
arkansas
river
and
benched
up
the
river
so
many
miles?”
is
it
your
position
that
that
means
the
whole
bed
of
the
river
or
half
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
a
part
of
the
river
that
is
on
the
boundary
not
between
the
two,
but
is
there
a
part
of
the
river
that's
on
the
boundary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
claim
that
whole
river
bed
there
or
half
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
kirk
with
boundaries
on
each
side
of
the
river
for
each
nation,
had
that
been
a
boundary
line
between
two
states,
what
would
be
the
line
in
the
river?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
we
have
a
conveyance
from
the
united
states
to
a
nation.
why
wouldn't
that
same
rule
of
construction
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
louisiana
against
--
versus
mississippi,
this
court
found
that
it
was.
when
a
navigable
river
constitutes
a
boundary
between
two
independent
states,
the
line
defining
that
point
at
which
jurisdiction
the
two
states
have
is
the
middle
of
the
stream,
the
channel.
that
what
this
court
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
not
a
recent
opinion.
the
opinion
it
refers
is
in
1905.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
context
between
the
state
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
as
to
where
their
boundary
line
was.
justice
thurgood
