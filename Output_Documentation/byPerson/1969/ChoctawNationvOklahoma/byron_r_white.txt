justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
choctaws
were
on
this
side
of
the
river,
the
cherokees
in
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
if
1936,
the
question
that
came
up
with
respect
to
the
cherokees'
referred,
i
take
it,
for
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
because
they
--
who
got
the
first
grant
here
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately
after
that
at
least
it
should
came
up
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
arkansas
river
bed,
would
you
say
that
choctaws
own
the
whole
bed?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
arkansas
river
for
being
granted
land
on
the
bank,
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
granted
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
did
the
cherokees
have
to
give?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
at
least
the
grant
to
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
of
land
adjoining
the
river
carried
with
it
the
title
to
the
river
bed
at
least
to
the
middle?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
either
the
united
states
had
the
river
bed
left
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
give
some
other
to
the
current
--
to
the
cherokees
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
after
having
giving
land
to
the
choctaws
or
it
didn't,
one
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
did
it
convey
a
way
all
the
river
bed
to
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
were
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
representing
the
cherokees
alone,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
--
that
language
didn't
convey
all
the
river
bed
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
deny
that
the
cherokees
have
an
interest
in
the
river
bed
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
got
the
title
--
because
you
got
title
to
it
first
under
the
same
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
united
states
didn't
try
to
give
it
away
again
to
the
cherokees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
tried
to
convey
it
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
way
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
way
they
dealt
with
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)
that
you
would
be
--
in
order
to
settle,
it
--
between
the
tribe,
would
still
be
giving
--
the
same
language
as
if,
you're
dealing
with
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
i
suppose
you
would
(inaudible)
on
words
of
this
forever
and
walk
down
the
arkansas
river,
carried
the
title
to
the
bed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
united
states
didn't
have
anything
more
to
give
in
writing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
down
the
road
--
down
the
arkansas
means
along
the
arkansas,
then
you
have
lost
your
claim?
justice
byron

white
would
you,
before
you
finish
your
history,
indicate
what
happened
later,
mr.
ford?
was
the
--
what
--
did
there
come
a
time
when
the
tribe
was
dissolved
or
--
i
don't
know
what
that
direct

or
not,
is
it
still
an

was
there
some

all
the

all
the

except
what
we're
talking
about
here
i
suppose
(voice

but
the

but
individual

were
allotted
parts
of
what
had
been
the

and
the

are
the
indians
still

they
were
free
to
transfer
to
those
lands
individually,
i
suppose?
justice

yeah,
but
after
allotment,
after

justice

how
many

they

do

about

justice

white
(ianudible)
a

justice

i
suppose
theoretically
at

the

even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
on
the
grounds
that
it
used
to
(ianudible)
of
this
case,
there
could
still
be
an

that
after
all,
the

only
granted
lands,
to
the

of
the

justice
byron

was
there
a
(inaudible)
in

i
--
certainly
its
in
the

there?
justice

white
you
don't
think
the
--
do
you
think
that
you'd
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
before
you
finish,
does
the
united
states
can
take
the
position
that
the
arkansas
was
then
or
is
not
now
i
guess
then
was
not
then
navigable
above
fort
gibson.
yesterday
you
said
we
are
talking
about
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
now,
i
suppose
their
indian
lands
border
of
the
arkansas
river
above
fort
gibson.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
still
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
many
of
that,
they
would
be
separated
of
the
question
for
any
of
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
ever
been
litigated?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
their
educational
systems,
first
grade
to
high
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
fort
gibson
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
settled
that
the
arkansas
was
thought
to
be
navigable
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
above
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
settled
that
it
was
not
navigable
above
fort
gibson.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
it
is
now,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
a
covenant
in
their
leases
guaranteeing
the
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you're
obliged
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
your
--
you
have
usual
royalty
for
your
leases.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
oil
gas
1/8.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
produce
--
are
those
leases
producing
revenue
for
the
state
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
value
is
the
riverbed
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
other
than
the
mineral
production?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
when
the
river
is
deepened
and
channeled
what
used
to
be
covered
by
water
isn't
(voice

by
water
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
lands
are
then
exposed
they
are
ready
for
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
are
the
lands
that
oklahoma
would
like
to
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
is
that
the
coal
of
the
respective
red
river
the
same
as
that
of
the
arkansas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
will
take
a
quite
(inaudible)
whether
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
included
in
the
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
it
is
but
it
may
be
--
it's
clear
that
the
patent
included
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
major
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
if
it
were
held
i
suppose
if
this
happens
to
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
that's
scoop
up
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
same
exactly
the
same
language
should
include
then
the
red
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
it
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
now
asking
you
concede
where
your
case
is
and
if
it
were
held
in
this
case
time
whether
your
intentions,
given
intentions.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
happened
to
convey
bed
of
the
red
river
and
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
to
be
shared
on
the
north
of
the
choctaw.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
patent
would
convey
the
bed
of
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
dependent
on
the
riparian
owners
of
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
point
that
if
you
read
the
cherokee
patent,
the
cherokee
lands
straddle
the
arkansas
and
you
cross
the
arkansas
at
one
point
to
get
south
of
the
river
and
cross
back
to
the
north
of
another
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
the
--
if
you
follow
these
calls,
they
gave
and
see
simple
and
all
there
was,
was
in
the
boundaries
is
that
needs
some
boundary
description.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
riverbed
clearly
within
the
bounds
where
this
meets
and
bound
description.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument,
those
that
you
said
those
cases
hold
united
states
never
owned
the
riverbeds
to
give
away
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
have
title
to
convey
away
under
certain
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
we
go
back
on
involvement
with
you
sir,
is
that
your
contention
here
that
if
the
patent
to
either
one
of
these
tribes
had
specifically
and
expressly
said
that
the
riverbed
of
arkansas
is
included
in
the
grant?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
then
be
a
contention
that
there
would
have
been
no
conveyance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
these
patents
are
sufficiently
clear
in
a
sense
that
they
fully
intended
to
do
convey
all
the
part
of
the
riverbed,
you
would
say
the
united
states
had
power
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
in
looking
at
your
brief
it
seems
to
me
you've
pretty
well
conceded
that
the
patent
to
the
cherokee,
for
example,
where
from
the
mouth
of
the
canadian
through
the
boundary
of
the
arkansas
river
to
the
boundary
of
state
of
arkansas
that
if
you
just
read
that
patent,
you
end
up
on
the
western
ground
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
the
south
side
of
the
river.
that's
what
the
patent
says,
“to
the
northerly
point
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
choctaw
lands
on
the
south
of
side
of
the
river.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
would've
been
a
lot
better
that
patent
that
said
the
opposite
field.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
resort
to
field
notes?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
a
survey.
what
is
your
understanding
in
oklahoma's
and
what
controls
in
a
field
or
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
cases
in
oklahoma
where
field
notes
override
to
clear
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
disagree
then
that
the
in
this
patent,
the
call
for
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
cherokee
land
was
on
the
south
side,
on
the
south
side
of
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
south
bank
--
now,
remember
the
southeast
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
you
--
how
can
you
possibly
read
that
patent
that
way
when
it
says
that
the
when
you
from
canadian
down
the
river
to
the
down
arkansas
you
end
up
to
the
point
on
the
south,
at
the
northeast
point
of
choctaw
land
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
where
the
southeast
corner
of
cherokee
land
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
explain
it
in
your
brief,
so
i
was
just
wondering
how
you
explain
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
you
do
is
you
want
to
talk
about
the
field
notes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
when
the
patent
that
says
they
are
on
the
south
side
of
the
arkansas
river,
you
did
not
mean
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
location
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
that
one
quarter
of
the
cherokee
land
is
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
lands
of
the
choctaws.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
at
the
more
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
land
of
the
choctaws
on,
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
mean
it's
there
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
submitted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
just
ask
you,
you
assert
in
your
brief
that
the
patent
that
says
that
this
was
prepared
from
mr.
mccoy's
field
notes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
you
make
the
survey
and
filed
these
notes
to
the
client.
i'm
just
wondering
other
these
records
from
mr.
mccoy's
notes
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
reference
in
the
survey
in
the
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
treaty
with
the
cherokee
said
that
they
wouldn't
be
put
out
of
the
cherokee
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
patents?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
usually
presented
in
the
[inaudible]
creeks?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
arkansas
was
considered
navigable
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a

justice

do
you

that's

i
just
--
justice

white

we'll
reach
the

and
talk
about
that
briefly.
justice

white
did
the

of

there?
justice

the

hold
there
--
justice

white
well,
across

at

[inaudible]
justice

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
so,
you
are
saying,
do
you
think
that
length
is
about
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
the
south
side
of
the
river
up
to
the
north

justice

have
you
included
in

to

the

a

and
they

they
did

it.
justice

white
the

to

at

the

that's
complete
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
choctaws
were
on
this
side
of
the
river,
the
cherokees
in
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
if
1936,
the
question
that
came
up
with
respect
to
the
cherokees'
referred,
i
take
it,
for
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
because
they
--
who
got
the
first
grant
here
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately
after
that
at
least
it
should
came
up
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
arkansas
river
bed,
would
you
say
that
choctaws
own
the
whole
bed?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
arkansas
river
for
being
granted
land
on
the
bank,
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
granted
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
did
the
cherokees
have
to
give?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
at
least
the
grant
to
the
cherokees
and
the
choctaws
of
land
adjoining
the
river
carried
with
it
the
title
to
the
river
bed
at
least
to
the
middle?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
either
the
united
states
had
the
river
bed
left
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
give
some
other
to
the
current
--
to
the
cherokees
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
after
having
giving
land
to
the
choctaws
or
it
didn't,
one
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
did
it
convey
a
way
all
the
river
bed
to
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
were
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
representing
the
cherokees
alone,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
--
that
language
didn't
convey
all
the
river
bed
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
deny
that
the
cherokees
have
an
interest
in
the
river
bed
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
got
the
title
--
because
you
got
title
to
it
first
under
the
same
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
united
states
didn't
try
to
give
it
away
again
to
the
cherokees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
tried
to
convey
it
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
way
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
way
they
dealt
with
the
choctaws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)
that
you
would
be
--
in
order
to
settle,
it
--
between
the
tribe,
would
still
be
giving
--
the
same
language
as
if,
you're
dealing
with
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
i
suppose
you
would
(inaudible)
on
words
of
this
forever
and
walk
down
the
arkansas
river,
carried
the
title
to
the
bed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
united
states
didn't
have
anything
more
to
give
in
writing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
down
the
road
--
down
the
arkansas
means
along
the
arkansas,
then
you
have
lost
your
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you,
before
you
finish
your
history,
indicate
what
happened
later,
mr.
ford?
was
the
--
what
--
did
there
come
a
time
when
the
tribe
was
dissolved
or
--
i
don't
know
what
that
direct
word
or
not,
is
it
still
an
enrolled
tribe?
justice
byron

white
was
there
some
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
all
the
indian
lands,
all
the
indian
lands
except
what
we're
talking
about
here
i
suppose
(voice

--
justice
byron

white
but
the
--
but
individual
indians
were
allotted
parts
of
what
had
been
the
tribal
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
are
the
indians
still
--
they
were
free
to
transfer
to
those
lands
individually,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
after
allotment,
after
allotment?
justice
byron

white
how
many
cherokees
are
there
still
there
in
the
tribe?
justice
byron

42,000.
justice
byron

white
and
--
justice
byron

do
they
--
the
most
of
42,000
live
in

on
tribal
lands
or
on
their
individually
owned
lands?
justice
byron

subject
to
the

when
they
live

most
of

those
are
the
commonly

lands?
justice
byron

that
way,
you're
living
on
your

i

your

any

subject
to
ordinary

--
justice
byron

but
do
they
run
their
own

justice
byron

white
but
they
can
go
state
schools
(voice

--yes
sir
and
they
enter
as
a
tribe
into
a
construction
of
common
efforts
from
encouraging
industry.
justice
byron

white
but
do
the
cherokees
have
some
schools
which
they
themselves
finance?
justice
byron

white
at
the

justice
byron

white
out
of
tribal
funds.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
lands
involved
from
one
side
of
the

justice
byron

white
how
about
the
service
for
a
--
where
a
--
one
tribe
owns
this
land
along
this
side
of
the
river,
on
the

side
of
the

its
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
this
is
navigable?
justice
byron

white
how
about
the
creeks
seminal?
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
choctaw
is
one
of
the

or
the
cherokee,
the
(inaudible)
on

side
of
the

and
the

seminal
is
on

justice

creeks'
seminal,
those
lands
bordering
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron

white
mr.
claibrone
(inaudible)
down
the
arkansas

was
there
a
claim
that
it
meant
alongside,
along
the
bank
of
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
(ianudible)
a
construction
of
that
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
theoretically
at
least,
the
--
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
on
the
grounds
that
it
used
to
(ianudible)
of
this
case,
there
could
still
be
an
argument
that
after
all,
the
patent
only
granted
lands,
to
the
bank
of
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
(inaudible)
in
the
case?
i
--
certainly
its
in
the
briefs
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
--
do
you
think
that
you'd
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
before
you
finish,
does
the
united
states
can
take
the
position
that
the
arkansas
was
then
or
is
not
now
i
guess
then
was
not
then
navigable
above
fort
gibson.
yesterday
you
said
we
are
talking
about
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river.
now,
i
suppose
their
indian
lands
border
of
the
arkansas
river
above
fort
gibson.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
still
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
many
of
that,
they
would
be
separated
of
the
question
for
any
of
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
ever
been
litigated?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
their
educational
systems,
first
grade
to
high
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
fort
gibson
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
settled
that
the
arkansas
was
thought
to
be
navigable
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
above
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
settled
that
it
was
not
navigable
above
fort
gibson.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
it
is
now,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
a
covenant
in
their
leases
guaranteeing
the
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you're
obliged
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
your
--
you
have
usual
royalty
for
your
leases.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
oil
gas
1/8.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
produce
--
are
those
leases
producing
revenue
for
the
state
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
value
is
the
riverbed
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
other
than
the
mineral
production?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
when
the
river
is
deepened
and
channeled
what
used
to
be
covered
by
water
isn't
(voice

by
water
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
lands
are
then
exposed
they
are
ready
for
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
are
the
lands
that
oklahoma
would
like
to
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
is
that
the
coal
of
the
respective
red
river
the
same
as
that
of
the
arkansas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
will
take
a
quite
(inaudible)
whether
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
included
in
the
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
it
is
but
it
may
be
--
it's
clear
that
the
patent
included
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
major
treaty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
if
it
were
held
i
suppose
if
this
happens
to
the
cherokees
and
choctaws
and
that's
scoop
up
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
same
exactly
the
same
language
should
include
then
the
red
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
it
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
now
asking
you
concede
where
your
case
is
and
if
it
were
held
in
this
case
time
whether
your
intentions,
given
intentions.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
happened
to
convey
bed
of
the
red
river
and
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river
to
be
shared
on
the
north
of
the
choctaw.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
patent
would
convey
the
bed
of
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
dependent
on
the
riparian
owners
of
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
point
that
if
you
read
the
cherokee
patent,
the
cherokee
lands
straddle
the
arkansas
and
you
cross
the
arkansas
at
one
point
to
get
south
of
the
river
and
cross
back
to
the
north
of
another
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
the
--
if
you
follow
these
calls,
they
gave
and
see
simple
and
all
there
was,
was
in
the
boundaries
is
that
needs
some
boundary
description.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
riverbed
clearly
within
the
bounds
where
this
meets
and
bound
description.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument,
those
that
you
said
those
cases
hold
united
states
never
owned
the
riverbeds
to
give
away
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
have
title
to
convey
away
under
certain
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
we
go
back
on
involvement
with
you
sir,
is
that
your
contention
here
that
if
the
patent
to
either
one
of
these
tribes
had
specifically
and
expressly
said
that
the
riverbed
of
arkansas
is
included
in
the
grant?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
then
be
a
contention
that
there
would
have
been
no
conveyance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
these
patents
are
sufficiently
clear
in
a
sense
that
they
fully
intended
to
do
convey
all
the
part
of
the
riverbed,
you
would
say
the
united
states
had
power
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
in
looking
at
your
brief
it
seems
to
me
you've
pretty
well
conceded
that
the
patent
to
the
cherokee,
for
example,
where
from
the
mouth
of
the
canadian
through
the
boundary
of
the
arkansas
river
to
the
boundary
of
state
of
arkansas
that
if
you
just
read
that
patent,
you
end
up
on
the
western
ground
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
the
south
side
of
the
river.
that's
what
the
patent
says,
“to
the
northerly
point
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
choctaw
lands
on
the
south
of
side
of
the
river.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
would've
been
a
lot
better
that
patent
that
said
the
opposite
field.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
resort
to
field
notes?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
a
survey.
what
is
your
understanding
in
oklahoma's
and
what
controls
in
a
field
or
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
cases
in
oklahoma
where
field
notes
override
to
clear
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
disagree
then
that
the
in
this
patent,
the
call
for
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
cherokee
land
was
on
the
south
side,
on
the
south
side
of
the
arkansas
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
south
bank
--
now,
remember
the
southeast
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
you
--
how
can
you
possibly
read
that
patent
that
way
when
it
says
that
the
when
you
from
canadian
down
the
river
to
the
down
arkansas
you
end
up
to
the
point
on
the
south,
at
the
northeast
point
of
choctaw
land
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
where
the
southeast
corner
of
cherokee
land
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
explain
it
in
your
brief,
so
i
was
just
wondering
how
you
explain
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
you
do
is
you
want
to
talk
about
the
field
notes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
when
the
patent
that
says
they
are
on
the
south
side
of
the
arkansas
river,
you
did
not
mean
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
location
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
that
one
quarter
of
the
cherokee
land
is
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
lands
of
the
choctaws.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
at
the
more
extremity
of
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
land
of
the
choctaws
on,
on
the
south
bank
of
the
arkansas
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
mean
it's
there
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
submitted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
just
ask
you,
you
assert
in
your
brief
that
the
patent
that
says
that
this
was
prepared
from
mr.
mccoy's
field
notes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
you
make
the
survey
and
filed
these
notes
to
the
client.
i'm
just
wondering
other
these
records
from
mr.
mccoy's
notes
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
reference
in
the
survey
in
the
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
treaty
with
the
cherokee
said
that
they
wouldn't
be
put
out
of
the
cherokee
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
patents?
justice
byron
r.

is
usually
presented
in

arkansas

considered
navigable
