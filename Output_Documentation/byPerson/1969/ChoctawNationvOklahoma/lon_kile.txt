mr.
lon
kile
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
is
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
to
review
this
decision
affirming
a
pretrial
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
oklahoma
which
in
effect
vested
title
to
the
map
--
of
course
to
the
arkansas
river
within
the
oklahoma,
in
the
state.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
this
action
involves
the
ownership
of
the
ablest
beds
and
the
soil
and
the
minerals
and
a
short
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
that
lies
within
oklahoma.
the
stretch
of
the
river
with
which
this
case
is
concerned
is
navigable.
oklahoma
contends
that
in
colonial
days
the
crown
on
the
beds
are
the
navigable
streams
and
then
when
the
13
colonies
became
independent,
they
succeeded
to
rights
of
the
crown
so
that
they
then
became
the
owners
of
the
navigable
--
of
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
within
their
limits.
and
that
afterwards,
as
each
state
entered
the
union,
it
entered
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
colonies
and
thus
said
the
state,
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
in
1907,
it
succeeded
to
the
title
that
the
united
states
had
in
the
navigable
portion
of
the
rivers
within
its
borders
and
that
it
owns
the
ablest
beds
and
the
soil
and
minerals
underlying
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
within
its
borders
--
mr.
lon
kile
--
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
the
--
mr.
lon
kile
the
brief
from
the
choctaw
and
the
chickasaw
nations
has
a

it
is

your

of
the

of
the
choctaw
(voice

--
mr.
lon

yes,

mr.
lon

that
is
correct.
may
it
please
the
court.

your
honor.
the

mr.
lon
kile
yes
--
yes
your
honor.
the
significance
of
this
map
which
actually
was
prepared
by
mr.
ford
in
connection
with
his
argument
on
--
and
he
will
follow
me
in
this.
the
shaded
portion
in
arkansas
was
the
lands
originally
allotted
to
the
cherokee
indians.
they
moved
there
from
georgia
in
1817
then
it
shows
the
area
ceded
to
the
cherokees
later
by
their
treaties
of
1828
and
1835.
the
map
that
is
on
page
25
of
the
--
of
our
brief
may
be
a
little
more
helpful
to
the
court
in
following
the
argument.
the
map
on
page
25
of
our
brief
shows
the
lands
allotted
to
the
cherokees
and
shows
the
lands
allotted
to
the
choctaw.
it
shows
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
with
the
arkansas
and
it
is
that
portion
of
the
arkansas
that
lays
below
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
lawsuit.
the
indian
tribes
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
--
as
an
aid
to
the
court
we
colored
that
just
lightly
heavier
so
that
it
would
be
easier
to
identify,
but
we
so
stated
in
our
brief
so
that
wouldn't
be
considered
misleading.
the
indian
tribes
contend
that
through
a
series
of
treaties
commencing
in
1820
and
grants
continuing
through
1842,
the
united
states
ceded
to
the
indian
tribes
the
bed
of
all
of
the
streams
within
what
is
now
the
portion
of
oklahoma
that's
involved.
they
say
that
the
united
states
did
that
for
these
reasons
the
explosive
development
of
the
cotton
economy
around
18
hundred
resulted
in
great
pressures
by
the
white
planters
upon
the
federal
government
to
move
the
indians
out
of
the
southern
states.
at
the
same
time,
the
white
planters
were
bringing
great
pressures
to
bear
upon
the
federal
government,
the
governments
of
the
southern
states
themselves
systematically
harassed
the
indians
for
the
purpose
of
making
their
life
in
the
southern
states
unendurable.
by
way
of
example,
georgia
tore
up
the
federal
treaties
with
the
cherokees
and
annexed
the
territories
of
the
cherokees
and
the
creeks
nation
within
its
territory.
and
samuel
worcester,
the
principal
figure
in
the
celebrated
case
of
worcester
versus
georgia,
was
a
presbyterian
minister,
sentenced
to
four
years
of
hard
labor
in
a
penitentiary
in
georgia
because
he
dared
to
live
on
cherokee
land
without
getting
permission
of
the
governor
of
arkansas.
alabama
tore
up
its
--
mr.
lon
kile
arkansas,
i'm
sorry,
georgia
your
honor,
i
had
the
arkansas
river
on
my
mind.
alabama
likewise
tore
up
the
federal
treaties
with
the
choctaws
and
mississippi
by
way
of
example
made
it
a
penitentiary
events
for
any
indian
to
exercise
the
office
of
chief,
mango
(ph),
headman
or
other
post
established
by
tribal
customs.
the
louisiana
purchase
of
1803
provided
a
good
place
to
move
the
southern
indians
if
they
could
be
induced
to
move
there.
as
a
part
of
its
efforts
to
persuade
the
indians
to
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states
and
move
to
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi,
the
federal
government
constantly
reminded
them
that
it
could
not
protect
them
either
from
the
white
people
in
the
south
or
from
the
governments
of
the
southern
states.
and
just
as
constantly,
it
pledged
to
these
indian
tribes
that
if
they
would
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states
that
the
lands
to
be
ceded
to
them
west
of
the
mississippi
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
now
the
southern
indians
did
move
west
of
the
mississippi.
they
did
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states,
but
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
getting
more
land.
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
getting
better
land.
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
going
to
live
under
better
conditions
in
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi
than
they
were
in
their
ancestral
homes.
they
did
it
for
one
reason,
and
for
reason
alone.
their
reliance
upon
the
promises
of
the
united
states
given
to
them
in
their
negotiations
with
the
united
states
and
reflected
in
their
treaties
with
the
united
states
that
if
they
would
move
out
of
the
southern
states,
on
to
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi,
the
land
ceded
to
them
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
that
pledge
was
not
only
reflected
in
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaties,
it
was
reflected
in
the
treaties
themselves
and
as
they
further
assurance,
the
united
states
gave
to
the
southern
tribes
and
it
gave
this
to
no
other
tribe
in
the
united
states,
a
fee
simple
title
to
the
lands
west
of
the
mississippi.
mr.
lon
kile
sir?
mr.
lon
kile
the
treaty
with
the
--
mr.
lon
kile
the
fee
simple
title,
1835
for
the
cherokees,
1842
for
the
choctaws.
now
it
is
well
established
by
shively
versus
bowlby
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
united
--
that
while
the
united
states
holds
land
in
territorial
status,
congress
has
the
power
to
make
grants
of
land
below
high
water
marks
of
navigable
waters
in
order
to
carry
out
a
public
purpose
appropriate
for
the
(inaudible)
for
which
the
united
states
hold
the
territory.
there
is
just
one
question
in
this
case
if
it
please
the
court,
and
that
case
is
correctly
stated
by
respondents
at
page
9
of
their
brief.
the
respondents
say
and
we
agree,
the
question
to
be
resolved
is
simple
and
direct.
did
the
united
states
convey
or
agreed
to
convey
the
river
bed
to
the
cherokees
or
the
choctaws?
there
is
no
other
question,
there
is
no
other
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
the
cherokee
--
the
choctaws
were
first
in
oklahoma.
the
cherokees
were
first
west
of
the
mississippi,
but
they
came
to
arkansas.
mr.
lon
kile
the
choctaws.
mr.
lon
kile
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
lon
kile
it
was
not
granted
on
the
banks
of
the
arkansas,
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
it
was
granted,
the
bed
of
the
arkansas,
the
language
--
mr.
lon
kile
to
the
choctaws.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
it
was
--
mr.
lon
kile
well,
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
choctaws
and
the
cherokees
as
to
whether
the
choctaws
own
it
all
or
the
cherokees
own
the
half
of
it.
now
the
district
court
just
--
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
i'm
not
saying
it
exactly
that
way.
the
treaties
set
down
the
arkansas,
up
the
arkansas,
where
the
arkansas
border
crosses
the
arkansas
river,
then
we
say,
“how
shall
that
be
construed?
shall
it
be
construed
this
up
the
arkansas
main
that
you
go
up
it
till
where
it
becomes
non-navigable
on
one
side
and
then
you
go
down
it
where
it
is
navigable?”
mr.
lon
kile
or
it
did
not.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
that's
right
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
that
will
be
our
position
when
the
matter
is
reheard
in
the
lower
courts
later
if
we
prevail
here.
mr.
lon
kile
we
will
--
mr.
lon
kile
well,
i
--
since
i
--
alright,
for
example
the
choctaws,
i
would
hate
--
i
would
have
to
say
what
i
would
do
if
represent.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor
we
say
that
either
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes.
mr.
lon
kile
well,
we
don't
think
they
tried
to
give
it
away.
they
--
mr.
lon
kile
they
referred
to
it
in
some
of
their
treaties
with
the
cherokees.
i'm
not
--
mr.
lon
kile
i'm
not
begging
the
question.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
they
didn't
have
anything
to
give
at
that
time.
they
had
already
received
it.
so
that
brings
us,
i
think
to
this
point
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
that
is
entirely
it.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
that
is
right
sir,
yes,
that
is
right.
the
--
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
so
because
we
come
to
this
question
then,
first,
how
shall
that
language
be
construed?
what
shall
down
the
arkansas,
because
that's
a
critical
thing
you
see,
because
when
you
deal
with
indian
nations
and
indian
tribes
and
treaties,
you
have
to
give
the
construction
that
is
most
favorable
to
the
indian
nation.
indeed
the
treaty
with
the
choctaws
specifically
provided,
the
article
24,
that
if
any
reasonable
doubt
existed,
it
must
be
construed
most
favorably
to
the
choctaws.
so
speaking
generically
now
as
the
indian
tribes,
we
say
this,
“how
shall
down
the
arkansas
be
construed?”
well
the
court
must
say
it
must
construed
most
favorably
to
the
indian
tribes.
then
what
is
the
most
favorable
construction
down
the
width
of
the
arkansas,
not
down
one
bank
or
the
other
bank
of
the
arkansas,
that's
--
we
deal
with
that
in
our
briefs,
perhaps
that
short
statement
is
no
over
simplification
of
it.
mr.
lon
kile
yes.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
we
will
probably
knock
heads
on
that.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
and
i
think
that
your
honor
reached
the
real
crux
of
this
case
by
that
inquiry.
when
the
united
states
held
territorial
lands,
it
held
the
beds
on
navigable
rivers
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state,
but
the
united
states
during
territorial
status
had
full
authority
to
convey
the
river
bed
for
purposes
that
were
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
it
held.
there
have
been
any
number
of
decisions
on
that.
so
then
we
--
this
point
comes
up,
well
why
would
the
united
states
have
held
this
bed
back
in
1820?
what
would
it
did
--
wanted
to
hold
the
bed
of
the
arkansas,
give
everything
all
around
it
but
withhold,
not
the
whole
arkansas
but
just
the
navigable
portion
of
it.
would
it
be
holding
it
for
a
future
state?
they
promised
the
indians
time
after
time
that
no
--
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
they
not
only
promised
it
to
them,
they
put
it
in
their
treaties.
they
therefore
could
not
have
been
in
1820,
contemplating
that
they
were
reserving
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state.
well,
would
it
have
been
reserving
it
for
the
minerals
that
were
in
it?
it
gave
the
indian
tribes
all
the
minerals
that
lay
above
the
navigable
portion,
why
would
it
hold
it
for
the
navigable
portion?
why
would
it
want
the
ablest
beds
in
1820?
why
would
it
want
the
ablest
beds
of
the
arkansas
when
it
was
giving
all
the
lands
on
both
sides
to
the
indian
tribes?
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir
because
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
the
united
states
always
has
and
controls
the
navigation
of
all
of
the
navigable
waters
in
oklahoma,
i
mean
the
united
states.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
if
the
language
of
the
treaty
is
and
we've
mentioned
that
in
our
brief,
reserved
to
the
united
states,
the
navigation
easement
and
it
does
so
in
a
rather
specific
way.
it
says
that
the
united
states,
that
the
choctaw
shall
have
the
right
to
use
it
just
like
any
other
people
have.
in
the
treaty
with
the
cherokees,
they
specifically
provided
that
the
united
states
would
have
the
right
to
use
the
river
to
supply
its
forts,
its
post
offices
and
its
post
roads.
so
all
the
united
states
did
and
the
united
states
did
that
in
its
treaties
with
the
indians
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief
that
they
reserved
the
navigation
easement.
it
has
just
never
been
disputed.
they've
always
exercised
it.
they
exercised
it
long
after
the
indians
moved
to
oklahoma.
they
exercised
it
in
fact
until
the
railroads
came.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir,
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
no,
the
land
--
the
indian
tribes
could
not
impose
any
limitations
on
them.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
that
is
five
minutes.
mr.
lon
kile
five
minutes.
my
time
is
rather
brief
and
--
but
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
reliance
on
the
three
cases
that
oklahoma
relies
on.
two
of
them
were
decisions
on
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
in
none
of
these
decisions,
i
will
say
were
the
indian
tribes
represented
or
was
the
government
represented
on
behalf
of
the
indian
tribes
in
any
of
these
case
nor
were
these
treaties
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
two
oklahoma
decisions
are
predicated
upon
the
belief
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
the
stated
belief
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
that
the
bed
of
the
river
was
being
held
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state.
and
if
it
was
the
intention
of
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes
in
the
early
1800's
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state,
then
the
premise
upon
which
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
are
bottomed
are
paux.
now,
there
is
one
case,
and
counsel
for
oklahoma
must
comment
on
it
at
great
length
and
he
must
try
to
show
that
it
is
related
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
challenge
him
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
do
so
and
that
is
the
holt
state
--
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
which
is
a
decision
of
this
court.
holt
state
bank
arose
in
minnesota
when
the
chippewas
ceded
their
aboriginal
lands
to
the
united
states,
reserving
to
themselves
a
right
of
occupancy
within
a
certain
area.
now,
it's
important
--
now
later,
they
did
in
their
session
and
the
chippewas
were
the
granting
party,
they
were
the
moving
party
and
that
distinguishes
and
interdicts
the
application
of
holt
state
bank
to
this
case
because
in
our
case,
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party.
now,
in
holt
state
bank,
this
court
said
of
the
chippewas,
if
they
had
wanted
to
keep
the
bed
of
mud
lake,
they
should
have
made
some
provision
for
it
in
their
cession
to
the
united
states,
but
when
the
teaching
of
holt
versus
state
--
the
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
is
applied
to
the
facts
in
our
case,
then
we
submit
this
court
would
have
said
had
the
united
states
being
the
granting
party
wanted
to
reserve
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
then
it
should
have
accepted
it
from
its
grant.
now,
we
say
to
the
court,
that
there
was
no
grant
moving
from
the
united
states
to
the
chippewas
in
holt
state
bank.
we
say
that
it
was
a
cession
by
the
chippewas
to
the
united
states.
i
notice
at
page
34
of
the
respondent's
brief
that
they
say
that
the
petitioners
and
amici
curiae,
that
they
find
in
our
briefs
persistent
misunderstandings
in
the
constructions
of
the
holding
of
this
court
at
holt
state
bank.
but
on
the
same
page
--
mr.
lon
kile
page
34
of
oklahoma's
brief,
but
at
--
in
the
first
sentence
on
that
page,
they
say
that
in
holt
state
bank,
the
united
states
had
granted
an
area
by
treaties
to
the
chippewas
and
on
page
36,
they
again
say
that
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party
and
on
page
37,
they
say
that
the
title
was
vested
in
the
chippewas
when
in
fact
the
title
was
always
vested
in
the
united
states,
the
chippewas
had
only
a
right
of
occupancy.
this
court
said
in
the
last
page
of
its
decision
in
holt
state
bank
or
rather
with
the
minute
that's
left
of
me,
most
of
the
reservations
said
this
court
in
holt
state
bank,
including
the
part
--
the
vicinity
of
mud
lake
was
relinquished
and
ceded
by
the
chippewas.
the
session
became
effective
through
the
president's
approval,
marks
the
board
in
1890.
and
in
the
last
page
of
the
court's
decision,
this
court
said,
“the
reservation
came
into
being
through
a
succession
of
treaties
with
the
chippewas
whereby
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
for
aboriginal
right
of
occupancy
to
the
surrounding
lands.
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
what
was
not
ceded.
the
effect
of
what
was
done
in
a
general
way,
the
effect
of
what
was
done
was
to
reserve
in
a
general
way
for
the
continued
occupation
of
the
indians
what
remained
of
their
aboriginal
territory
thus
again
be
known
and
recognized
as
a
reservation.
now
that
fact
is
the
distinguishing
fact
which
interdicts
the
application
of
holt
state
bank
to
this
case,
but
if
the
court
were
applying
the
rule,
the
teachings
in
holt
state
bank
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
would
have
said
this
i
believe.
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party
and
had
it
wanted
to
reserve
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
it
should
have
done
so
in
its
grant.
the
fact
that
it
agreed
with
the
indians
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
with
any
future
state
or
territory
evinced
the
intent
to
depart
from
the
established
purpose
of
reserving
the
beds
of
navigable
streams
for
the
benefit
of
future
states.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
united
states
had
nothing,
but
a
navigation
easement
on
the
arkansas
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
and
oklahoma
therefore
took
no
interest
in
the
bed
in
the
arkansas
river
by
being
--
by
a
reason
of
it
being
admitted
to
the
state,
to
the
union.
mr.
lon
kile
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
circuit
court's
decision
from
which
this
appeal
was
taken
had
turned
on
that
court's
construction
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
holt,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
a
review
of
the
facts
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
may
of
be
of
some
help
in
the
discussion
of
its
application
to
the
facts
and
the
case
at
bar.
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank,
chippewas
ceded
to
the
united
states
their
right
of
occupancy
to
a
certain
lands
in
minnesota.
in
return,
the
united
states
agreed
to
put
the
land
up
for
sale
and
when
it
was
sold,
put
the
money
into
a
trust
fund
to
be
used
for
the
benefits
of
chippewas.
within
the
lands
that
the
chippewas
ceded
to
the
united
states
was
a
lake
called
mud
lake.
following
the
treaty
with
the
chippewas,
minnesota
became
a
state
and
later
mud
lake
was
drained
and
its
bed
became
valuable
for
agricultural
purposes.
after
mud
lake
was
drained,
the
government
claimed
that
it
was
obligated
to
sell
the
bed
of
mud
lake
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewas.
the
defendants
claimed
that
upon
its
admittance
to
the
union,
minnesota
became
the
owner
of
the
bed
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
that
they
have
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
state.
the
case
presented
two
issues.
first,
was
the
lake
navigable
and
second,
were
the
lands
underlying
the
lake
disposed
of
by
the
united
states
before
minnesota
became
a
state.
well,
the
court
first
found
that
the
lake
was
navigable
and
then
it
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
has
its
post
of
those
lands
before
minnesota
became
a
state.
now
it
was
not
claimed
in
holt
state
bank
that
united
states
have
made
an
affirmative
disposition
of
the
bed
of
the
lake,
but
only
this
was
the
only
claim
that
was
made,
that
the
lake
was
in
the
limits
of
a
reservation
when
minnesota
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now,
in
it's
analysis
of
the
facts
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
“the
reservation
came
in
to
being
through
a
succession
of
treaties
with
the
chippewas
whereby
they
ceded
to
the
united
states,
their
aboriginal
right
of
occupancy
to
the
surrounding
lands.
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
what
was
not
ceded.
the
effect
of
what
was
done
was
to
reserve
in
a
general
way
for
the
continued
occupation
of
the
indians,
what
remained
of
their
aboriginal
territory
and
thus
it
came
to
be
known
and
recognized
as
a
reservation.”
this
court
in
its
decision
in
u.s.
versus
holt
state
bank
referred
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
said,
“first
that
disposals
by
the
united
states
during
territorial
days
is
not
likely
to
be
inferred
and
should
not
be
regarded
as
intended
unless
the
intention
was
definitely
declared
or
otherwise
made
very
plain.”
this
court
found
nothing
in
the
cession
of
a
right
of
occupancy
in
exchange
for
a
promise
that
the
land
would
be
sold
and
the
money
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewas,
rightfully
so
i
think
is
even
approaching
a
grant
by
the
government
to
the
indians
of
the
underlying
navigable
waters.
and
this
court
did
not
find
anything
in
this
cession
of
a
right
of
occupancy
in
exchange
for
the
creation
of
a
trust
fund
that
would
evince
a
purpose
to
depart
from
the
established
policy
of
treating
such
lands
as
held
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state
and
we
take
no
issue
with
this
court's
decision
in
holt
state
bank
case.
we
believe
that
--
we
believe
that
it's
a
good
decision
and
it's
a
sound
decision
and
one
that
should
be
allowed
a
stand.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
holt
state
bank,
the
chippewas
were
the
grantors
and
the
united
states
was
the
grantee.
the
court
said
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
that
which
was
not
ceded.
what
the
court
is
there
saying
is
this.
the
chippewas
were
the
grantors.
had
they
wanted
to
keep
the
soil
and
the
minerals,
underlying
mud
lake,
they
should
have
set
them
apart
from
their
cession.
but
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
shoe
fits
on
the
other
foot.
in
the
case
now
at
bar,
the
united
states
was
the
grantor
in
the
patent
of
the
cherokees
of
1838
and
it
was
the
grantor
in
the
patent
to
the
choctaws
in
1842.
applying
the
rule,
enunciated
in
holt
state
bank,
it
must
be
said
that
had
the
united
states
in
its
patent
to
the
cherokees
in
1838,
its
patent
to
the
choctaws
in
1842,
wanted
to
have
reserve
the
soils
and
minerals
underlying
any
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
it
should
have
done
so.
now,
it
is
said
in
holt
state
bank
and
we
think
that
it
is
a
sound
rule
that
before
a
disposal
of
the
bed
of
navigable
waters
by
the
united
states
can
be
inferred,
its
intent
to
do
so
should
be
made
very
plain.
if
it
appears
then
in
this
case
that
when
the
indians
moved
from
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
south
to
the
wild
lands
in
the
west,
it
was
both
their
intention
and
the
intention
of
the
united
states
that
the
lands
to
which
they
were
being
moved
would
never
be
embraced
in
the
state
or
territory.
if
it
appears
from
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaty,
the
language
of
the
treaties
themselves
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
indian
tribes
and
the
intention
of
the
united
states
that
the
lands
to
which
the
indians
were
being
moved
would
never
be
embraced
in
a
state
or
territory,
then
it
is
very
plain.
and
the
test
established
in
holt
state
bank
has
been
met,
that
the
united
states
would
have
no
reason
to
have
retained
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
in
these
lands.
the
absence
of
the
necessity
for
retaining
such
a
bed
coupled
with
the
urgency
associated
with
moving
the
indians
out
of
the
southern
states,
makes
the
intent
of
the
united
states
to
dispose
of
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
within
those
lands
to
which
the
indians
were
then
being
moved,
very
plain.
mr.
lon
kile
that
is
indeed
so.
the
treaty
with
the
choctaw
said
that
it
should
be
theirs
as
long
as
they
remained
a
nation.
mr.
lon
kile
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
black
the
treaties
were
made
with
the
choctaws
in
1820
and
with
the
cherokees
in
1828
and
another
treaty
with
the
choctaw
in
1832,
a
final
treaty
with
the
cherokees
in
1835.
the
result
of
these
treaties
were
the
issuance
of
a
patent.
the
first
patent
that
the
united
states
government
ever
gave
to
a
tribe
of
indians
or
it
conveyed
this
land
in
fee
simple
to
the
cherokees
in
1938
and
then
there's
another
patent,
being
second
patent
in
which
united
states
government
have
ever
conveyed
to
fee
simple
title
to
an
indian
tribe
to
the
choctaws
in
1842.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
i
think
so,
i
think
it
depends.
i
think
that
it
depends
upon
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaties
and
the
treaties
themselves.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir
and
it
is
in
writing
and
they
are
set
out
in
our
briefs.
mr.
lon
kile
and
the
patents,
the
patents
each
convey
a
fee
simple
title.
my
time
has
expired,
i
maybe
excused.
mr.
lon
kile
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
is
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
court
to
review
this
decision
affirming
a
pretrial
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
oklahoma
which
in
effect
vested
title
to
the
map
--
of
course
to
the
arkansas
river
within
the
oklahoma,
in
the
state.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
this
action
involves
the
ownership
of
the
ablest
beds
and
the
soil
and
the
minerals
and
a
short
stretch
of
the
arkansas
river
that
lies
within
oklahoma.
the
stretch
of
the
river
with
which
this
case
is
concerned
is
navigable.
oklahoma
contends
that
in
colonial
days
the
crown
on
the
beds
are
the
navigable
streams
and
then
when
the
13
colonies
became
independent,
they
succeeded
to
rights
of
the
crown
so
that
they
then
became
the
owners
of
the
navigable
--
of
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
within
their
limits.
and
that
afterwards,
as
each
state
entered
the
union,
it
entered
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
13
colonies
and
thus
said
the
state,
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
in
1907,
it
succeeded
to
the
title
that
the
united
states
had
in
the
navigable
portion
of
the
rivers
within
its
borders
and
that
it
owns
the
ablest
beds
and
the
soil
and
minerals
underlying
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river
within
its
borders
--
mr.
lon
kile
--
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
the
--
mr.
lon

the

mr.

is

mr.

yes
--
yes
your

the
significance
of
this
map
which
actually
was
prepared
by
mr.
ford
in
connection
with
his
argument
on
--
and
he
will
follow
me
in
this.
the
shaded
portion
in
arkansas
was
the
lands
originally
allotted
to
the
cherokee
indians.
they
moved
there
from
georgia
in
1817
then
it
shows
the
area
ceded
to
the
cherokees
later
by
their
treaties
of
1828
and
1835.
the
map
that
is
on
page
25
of
the
--
of
our
brief
may
be
a
little
more
helpful
to
the
court
in
following
the
argument.
the
map
on
page
25
of
our
brief
shows
the
lands
allotted
to
the
cherokees
and
shows
the
lands
allotted
to
the
choctaw.
it
shows
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
with
the
arkansas
and
it
is
that
portion
of
the
arkansas
that
lays
below
the
confluence
of
the
grand
river
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
lawsuit.
the
indian
tribes
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
--
as
an
aid
to
the
court
we
colored
that
just
lightly
heavier
so
that
it
would
be
easier
to
identify,
but
we
so
stated
in
our
brief
so
that
wouldn't
be
considered
misleading.
the
indian
tribes
contend
that
through
a
series
of
treaties
commencing
in
1820
and
grants
continuing
through
1842,
the
united
states
ceded
to
the
indian
tribes
the
bed
of
all
of
the
streams
within
what
is
now
the
portion
of
oklahoma
that's
involved.
they
say
that
the
united
states
did
that
for
these
reasons
the
explosive
development
of
the
cotton
economy
around
18
hundred
resulted
in
great
pressures
by
the
white
planters
upon
the
federal
government
to
move
the
indians
out
of
the
southern
states.
at
the
same
time,
the
white
planters
were
bringing
great
pressures
to
bear
upon
the
federal
government,
the
governments
of
the
southern
states
themselves
systematically
harassed
the
indians
for
the
purpose
of
making
their
life
in
the
southern
states
unendurable.
by
way
of
example,
georgia
tore
up
the
federal
treaties
with
the
cherokees
and
annexed
the
territories
of
the
cherokees
and
the
creeks
nation
within
its
territory.
and
samuel
worcester,
the
principal
figure
in
the
celebrated
case
of
worcester
versus
georgia,
was
a
presbyterian
minister,
sentenced
to
four
years
of
hard
labor
in
a
penitentiary
in
georgia
because
he
dared
to
live
on
cherokee
land
without
getting
permission
of
the
governor
of
arkansas.
alabama
tore
up
its
--
mr.
lon
kile
arkansas,
i'm
sorry,
georgia
your
honor,
i
had
the
arkansas
river
on
my
mind.
alabama
likewise
tore
up
the
federal
treaties
with
the
choctaws
and
mississippi
by
way
of
example
made
it
a
penitentiary
events
for
any
indian
to
exercise
the
office
of
chief,
mango
(ph),
headman
or
other
post
established
by
tribal
customs.
the
louisiana
purchase
of
1803
provided
a
good
place
to
move
the
southern
indians
if
they
could
be
induced
to
move
there.
as
a
part
of
its
efforts
to
persuade
the
indians
to
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states
and
move
to
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi,
the
federal
government
constantly
reminded
them
that
it
could
not
protect
them
either
from
the
white
people
in
the
south
or
from
the
governments
of
the
southern
states.
and
just
as
constantly,
it
pledged
to
these
indian
tribes
that
if
they
would
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states
that
the
lands
to
be
ceded
to
them
west
of
the
mississippi
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
now
the
southern
indians
did
move
west
of
the
mississippi.
they
did
give
up
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
southern
states,
but
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
getting
more
land.
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
getting
better
land.
they
did
not
do
that
because
they
were
going
to
live
under
better
conditions
in
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi
than
they
were
in
their
ancestral
homes.
they
did
it
for
one
reason,
and
for
reason
alone.
their
reliance
upon
the
promises
of
the
united
states
given
to
them
in
their
negotiations
with
the
united
states
and
reflected
in
their
treaties
with
the
united
states
that
if
they
would
move
out
of
the
southern
states,
on
to
the
wild
lands
west
of
the
mississippi,
the
land
ceded
to
them
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
that
pledge
was
not
only
reflected
in
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaties,
it
was
reflected
in
the
treaties
themselves
and
as
they
further
assurance,
the
united
states
gave
to
the
southern
tribes
and
it
gave
this
to
no
other
tribe
in
the
united
states,
a
fee
simple
title
to
the
lands
west
of
the
mississippi.
mr.
lon
kile
sir?
mr.
lon
kile
the
treaty
with
the
--
mr.
lon
kile
the
fee
simple
title,
1835
for
the
cherokees,
1842
for
the
choctaws.
now
it
is
well
established
by
shively
versus
bowlby
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
united
--
that
while
the
united
states
holds
land
in
territorial
status,
congress
has
the
power
to
make
grants
of
land
below
high
water
marks
of
navigable
waters
in
order
to
carry
out
a
public
purpose
appropriate
for
the
(inaudible)
for
which
the
united
states
hold
the
territory.
there
is
just
one
question
in
this
case
if
it
please
the
court,
and
that
case
is
correctly
stated
by
respondents
at
page
9
of
their
brief.
the
respondents
say
and
we
agree,
the
question
to
be
resolved
is
simple
and
direct.
did
the
united
states
convey
or
agreed
to
convey
the
river
bed
to
the
cherokees
or
the
choctaws?
there
is
no
other
question,
there
is
no
other
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
the
cherokee
--
the
choctaws
were
first
in
oklahoma.
the
cherokees
were
first
west
of
the
mississippi,
but
they
came
to
arkansas.
mr.
lon
kile
the
choctaws.
mr.
lon
kile
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
lon
kile
it
was
not
granted
on
the
banks
of
the
arkansas,
your
honor.
mr.
lon
kile
it
was
granted,
the
bed
of
the
arkansas,
the
language
--
mr.
lon
kile
to
the
choctaws.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
it
was
--
mr.
lon
kile
well,
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
choctaws
and
the
cherokees
as
to
whether
the
choctaws
own
it
all
or
the
cherokees
own
the
half
of
it.
now
the
district
court
just
--
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
i'm
not
saying
it
exactly
that
way.
the
treaties
set
down
the
arkansas,
up
the
arkansas,
where
the
arkansas
border
crosses
the
arkansas
river,
then
we
say,
“how
shall
that
be
construed?
shall
it
be
construed
this
up
the
arkansas
main
that
you
go
up
it
till
where
it
becomes
non-navigable
on
one
side
and
then
you
go
down
it
where
it
is
navigable?”
mr.
lon
kile
or
it
did
not.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
that's
right
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
that
will
be
our
position
when
the
matter
is
reheard
in
the
lower
courts
later
if
we
prevail
here.
mr.
lon
kile
we
will
--
mr.
lon
kile
well,
i
--
since
i
--
alright,
for
example
the
choctaws,
i
would
hate
--
i
would
have
to
say
what
i
would
do
if
represent.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
your
honor
we
say
that
either
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes.
mr.
lon
kile
well,
we
don't
think
they
tried
to
give
it
away.
they
--
mr.
lon
kile
they
referred
to
it
in
some
of
their
treaties
with
the
cherokees.
i'm
not
--
mr.
lon
kile
i'm
not
begging
the
question.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
they
didn't
have
anything
to
give
at
that
time.
they
had
already
received
it.
so
that
brings
us,
i
think
to
this
point
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
that
is
entirely
it.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
that
is
right
sir,
yes,
that
is
right.
the
--
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
so
because
we
come
to
this
question
then,
first,
how
shall
that
language
be
construed?
what
shall
down
the
arkansas,
because
that's
a
critical
thing
you
see,
because
when
you
deal
with
indian
nations
and
indian
tribes
and
treaties,
you
have
to
give
the
construction
that
is
most
favorable
to
the
indian
nation.
indeed
the
treaty
with
the
choctaws
specifically
provided,
the
article
24,
that
if
any
reasonable
doubt
existed,
it
must
be
construed
most
favorably
to
the
choctaws.
so
speaking
generically
now
as
the
indian
tribes,
we
say
this,
“how
shall
down
the
arkansas
be
construed?”
well
the
court
must
say
it
must
construed
most
favorably
to
the
indian
tribes.
then
what
is
the
most
favorable
construction
down
the
width
of
the
arkansas,
not
down
one
bank
or
the
other
bank
of
the
arkansas,
that's
--
we
deal
with
that
in
our
briefs,
perhaps
that
short
statement
is
no
over
simplification
of
it.
mr.
lon
kile
yes.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
we
will
probably
knock
heads
on
that.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
and
i
think
that
your
honor
reached
the
real
crux
of
this
case
by
that
inquiry.
when
the
united
states
held
territorial
lands,
it
held
the
beds
on
navigable
rivers
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state,
but
the
united
states
during
territorial
status
had
full
authority
to
convey
the
river
bed
for
purposes
that
were
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
it
held.
there
have
been
any
number
of
decisions
on
that.
so
then
we
--
this
point
comes
up,
well
why
would
the
united
states
have
held
this
bed
back
in
1820?
what
would
it
did
--
wanted
to
hold
the
bed
of
the
arkansas,
give
everything
all
around
it
but
withhold,
not
the
whole
arkansas
but
just
the
navigable
portion
of
it.
would
it
be
holding
it
for
a
future
state?
they
promised
the
indians
time
after
time
that
no
--
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state
or
territory.
they
not
only
promised
it
to
them,
they
put
it
in
their
treaties.
they
therefore
could
not
have
been
in
1820,
contemplating
that
they
were
reserving
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state.
well,
would
it
have
been
reserving
it
for
the
minerals
that
were
in
it?
it
gave
the
indian
tribes
all
the
minerals
that
lay
above
the
navigable
portion,
why
would
it
hold
it
for
the
navigable
portion?
why
would
it
want
the
ablest
beds
in
1820?
why
would
it
want
the
ablest
beds
of
the
arkansas
when
it
was
giving
all
the
lands
on
both
sides
to
the
indian
tribes?
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir
because
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
the
united
states
always
has
and
controls
the
navigation
of
all
of
the
navigable
waters
in
oklahoma,
i
mean
the
united
states.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
if
the
language
of
the
treaty
is
and
we've
mentioned
that
in
our
brief,
reserved
to
the
united
states,
the
navigation
easement
and
it
does
so
in
a
rather
specific
way.
it
says
that
the
united
states,
that
the
choctaw
shall
have
the
right
to
use
it
just
like
any
other
people
have.
in
the
treaty
with
the
cherokees,
they
specifically
provided
that
the
united
states
would
have
the
right
to
use
the
river
to
supply
its
forts,
its
post
offices
and
its
post
roads.
so
all
the
united
states
did
and
the
united
states
did
that
in
its
treaties
with
the
indians
and
we
point
that
out
in
our
brief
that
they
reserved
the
navigation
easement.
it
has
just
never
been
disputed.
they've
always
exercised
it.
they
exercised
it
long
after
the
indians
moved
to
oklahoma.
they
exercised
it
in
fact
until
the
railroads
came.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir,
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lon
kile
no
sir.
no,
the
land
--
the
indian
tribes
could
not
impose
any
limitations
on
them.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
that
is
five
minutes.
mr.
lon
kile
five
minutes.
my
time
is
rather
brief
and
--
but
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
reliance
on
the
three
cases
that
oklahoma
relies
on.
two
of
them
were
decisions
on
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
in
none
of
these
decisions,
i
will
say
were
the
indian
tribes
represented
or
was
the
government
represented
on
behalf
of
the
indian
tribes
in
any
of
these
case
nor
were
these
treaties
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
two
oklahoma
decisions
are
predicated
upon
the
belief
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
the
stated
belief
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
that
the
bed
of
the
river
was
being
held
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state.
and
if
it
was
the
intention
of
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes
in
the
early
1800's
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
in
any
state,
then
the
premise
upon
which
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
are
bottomed
are
paux.
now,
there
is
one
case,
and
counsel
for
oklahoma
must
comment
on
it
at
great
length
and
he
must
try
to
show
that
it
is
related
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
challenge
him
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
do
so
and
that
is
the
holt
state
--
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
which
is
a
decision
of
this
court.
holt
state
bank
arose
in
minnesota
when
the
chippewas
ceded
their
aboriginal
lands
to
the
united
states,
reserving
to
themselves
a
right
of
occupancy
within
a
certain
area.
now,
it's
important
--
now
later,
they
did
in
their
session
and
the
chippewas
were
the
granting
party,
they
were
the
moving
party
and
that
distinguishes
and
interdicts
the
application
of
holt
state
bank
to
this
case
because
in
our
case,
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party.
now,
in
holt
state
bank,
this
court
said
of
the
chippewas,
if
they
had
wanted
to
keep
the
bed
of
mud
lake,
they
should
have
made
some
provision
for
it
in
their
cession
to
the
united
states,
but
when
the
teaching
of
holt
versus
state
--
the
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
is
applied
to
the
facts
in
our
case,
then
we
submit
this
court
would
have
said
had
the
united
states
being
the
granting
party
wanted
to
reserve
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
then
it
should
have
accepted
it
from
its
grant.
now,
we
say
to
the
court,
that
there
was
no
grant
moving
from
the
united
states
to
the
chippewas
in
holt
state
bank.
we
say
that
it
was
a
cession
by
the
chippewas
to
the
united
states.
i
notice
at
page
34
of
the
respondent's
brief
that
they
say
that
the
petitioners
and
amici
curiae,
that
they
find
in
our
briefs
persistent
misunderstandings
in
the
constructions
of
the
holding
of
this
court
at
holt
state
bank.
but
on
the
same
page
--
mr.
lon
kile
page
34
of
oklahoma's
brief,
but
at
--
in
the
first
sentence
on
that
page,
they
say
that
in
holt
state
bank,
the
united
states
had
granted
an
area
by
treaties
to
the
chippewas
and
on
page
36,
they
again
say
that
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party
and
on
page
37,
they
say
that
the
title
was
vested
in
the
chippewas
when
in
fact
the
title
was
always
vested
in
the
united
states,
the
chippewas
had
only
a
right
of
occupancy.
this
court
said
in
the
last
page
of
its
decision
in
holt
state
bank
or
rather
with
the
minute
that's
left
of
me,
most
of
the
reservations
said
this
court
in
holt
state
bank,
including
the
part
--
the
vicinity
of
mud
lake
was
relinquished
and
ceded
by
the
chippewas.
the
session
became
effective
through
the
president's
approval,
marks
the
board
in
1890.
and
in
the
last
page
of
the
court's
decision,
this
court
said,
“the
reservation
came
into
being
through
a
succession
of
treaties
with
the
chippewas
whereby
they
ceded
to
the
united
states
for
aboriginal
right
of
occupancy
to
the
surrounding
lands.
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
what
was
not
ceded.
the
effect
of
what
was
done
in
a
general
way,
the
effect
of
what
was
done
was
to
reserve
in
a
general
way
for
the
continued
occupation
of
the
indians
what
remained
of
their
aboriginal
territory
thus
again
be
known
and
recognized
as
a
reservation.
now
that
fact
is
the
distinguishing
fact
which
interdicts
the
application
of
holt
state
bank
to
this
case,
but
if
the
court
were
applying
the
rule,
the
teachings
in
holt
state
bank
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
would
have
said
this
i
believe.
the
united
states
was
the
granting
party
and
had
it
wanted
to
reserve
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river,
the
navigable
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
it
should
have
done
so
in
its
grant.
the
fact
that
it
agreed
with
the
indians
that
this
area
would
never
be
embraced
with
any
future
state
or
territory
evinced
the
intent
to
depart
from
the
established
purpose
of
reserving
the
beds
of
navigable
streams
for
the
benefit
of
future
states.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
united
states
had
nothing,
but
a
navigation
easement
on
the
arkansas
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
and
oklahoma
therefore
took
no
interest
in
the
bed
in
the
arkansas
river
by
being
--
by
a
reason
of
it
being
admitted
to
the
state,
to
the
union.
mr.
lon
kile
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
circuit
court's
decision
from
which
this
appeal
was
taken
had
turned
on
that
court's
construction
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
holt,
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank.
a
review
of
the
facts
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank
may
of
be
of
some
help
in
the
discussion
of
its
application
to
the
facts
and
the
case
at
bar.
in
united
states
versus
holt
state
bank,
chippewas
ceded
to
the
united
states
their
right
of
occupancy
to
a
certain
lands
in
minnesota.
in
return,
the
united
states
agreed
to
put
the
land
up
for
sale
and
when
it
was
sold,
put
the
money
into
a
trust
fund
to
be
used
for
the
benefits
of
chippewas.
within
the
lands
that
the
chippewas
ceded
to
the
united
states
was
a
lake
called
mud
lake.
following
the
treaty
with
the
chippewas,
minnesota
became
a
state
and
later
mud
lake
was
drained
and
its
bed
became
valuable
for
agricultural
purposes.
after
mud
lake
was
drained,
the
government
claimed
that
it
was
obligated
to
sell
the
bed
of
mud
lake
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewas.
the
defendants
claimed
that
upon
its
admittance
to
the
union,
minnesota
became
the
owner
of
the
bed
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
that
they
have
succeeded
to
the
rights
of
the
state.
the
case
presented
two
issues.
first,
was
the
lake
navigable
and
second,
were
the
lands
underlying
the
lake
disposed
of
by
the
united
states
before
minnesota
became
a
state.
well,
the
court
first
found
that
the
lake
was
navigable
and
then
it
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
has
its
post
of
those
lands
before
minnesota
became
a
state.
now
it
was
not
claimed
in
holt
state
bank
that
united
states
have
made
an
affirmative
disposition
of
the
bed
of
the
lake,
but
only
this
was
the
only
claim
that
was
made,
that
the
lake
was
in
the
limits
of
a
reservation
when
minnesota
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now,
in
it's
analysis
of
the
facts
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
“the
reservation
came
in
to
being
through
a
succession
of
treaties
with
the
chippewas
whereby
they
ceded
to
the
united
states,
their
aboriginal
right
of
occupancy
to
the
surrounding
lands.
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
what
was
not
ceded.
the
effect
of
what
was
done
was
to
reserve
in
a
general
way
for
the
continued
occupation
of
the
indians,
what
remained
of
their
aboriginal
territory
and
thus
it
came
to
be
known
and
recognized
as
a
reservation.”
this
court
in
its
decision
in
u.s.
versus
holt
state
bank
referred
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
said,
“first
that
disposals
by
the
united
states
during
territorial
days
is
not
likely
to
be
inferred
and
should
not
be
regarded
as
intended
unless
the
intention
was
definitely
declared
or
otherwise
made
very
plain.”
this
court
found
nothing
in
the
cession
of
a
right
of
occupancy
in
exchange
for
a
promise
that
the
land
would
be
sold
and
the
money
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
chippewas,
rightfully
so
i
think
is
even
approaching
a
grant
by
the
government
to
the
indians
of
the
underlying
navigable
waters.
and
this
court
did
not
find
anything
in
this
cession
of
a
right
of
occupancy
in
exchange
for
the
creation
of
a
trust
fund
that
would
evince
a
purpose
to
depart
from
the
established
policy
of
treating
such
lands
as
held
for
the
benefit
of
a
future
state
and
we
take
no
issue
with
this
court's
decision
in
holt
state
bank
case.
we
believe
that
--
we
believe
that
it's
a
good
decision
and
it's
a
sound
decision
and
one
that
should
be
allowed
a
stand.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
holt
state
bank,
the
chippewas
were
the
grantors
and
the
united
states
was
the
grantee.
the
court
said
there
was
no
formal
setting
apart
of
that
which
was
not
ceded.
what
the
court
is
there
saying
is
this.
the
chippewas
were
the
grantors.
had
they
wanted
to
keep
the
soil
and
the
minerals,
underlying
mud
lake,
they
should
have
set
them
apart
from
their
cession.
but
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
shoe
fits
on
the
other
foot.
in
the
case
now
at
bar,
the
united
states
was
the
grantor
in
the
patent
of
the
cherokees
of
1838
and
it
was
the
grantor
in
the
patent
to
the
choctaws
in
1842.
applying
the
rule,
enunciated
in
holt
state
bank,
it
must
be
said
that
had
the
united
states
in
its
patent
to
the
cherokees
in
1838,
its
patent
to
the
choctaws
in
1842,
wanted
to
have
reserve
the
soils
and
minerals
underlying
any
portion
of
the
arkansas
river,
it
should
have
done
so.
now,
it
is
said
in
holt
state
bank
and
we
think
that
it
is
a
sound
rule
that
before
a
disposal
of
the
bed
of
navigable
waters
by
the
united
states
can
be
inferred,
its
intent
to
do
so
should
be
made
very
plain.
if
it
appears
then
in
this
case
that
when
the
indians
moved
from
their
ancestral
homes
in
the
south
to
the
wild
lands
in
the
west,
it
was
both
their
intention
and
the
intention
of
the
united
states
that
the
lands
to
which
they
were
being
moved
would
never
be
embraced
in
the
state
or
territory.
if
it
appears
from
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaty,
the
language
of
the
treaties
themselves
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
indian
tribes
and
the
intention
of
the
united
states
that
the
lands
to
which
the
indians
were
being
moved
would
never
be
embraced
in
a
state
or
territory,
then
it
is
very
plain.
and
the
test
established
in
holt
state
bank
has
been
met,
that
the
united
states
would
have
no
reason
to
have
retained
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
in
these
lands.
the
absence
of
the
necessity
for
retaining
such
a
bed
coupled
with
the
urgency
associated
with
moving
the
indians
out
of
the
southern
states,
makes
the
intent
of
the
united
states
to
dispose
of
the
beds
of
the
navigable
streams
within
those
lands
to
which
the
indians
were
then
being
moved,
very
plain.
mr.
lon
kile
that
is
indeed
so.
the
treaty
with
the
choctaw
said
that
it
should
be
theirs
as
long
as
they
remained
a
nation.
mr.
lon
kile
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
black
the
treaties
were
made
with
the
choctaws
in
1820
and
with
the
cherokees
in
1828
and
another
treaty
with
the
choctaw
in
1832,
a
final
treaty
with
the
cherokees
in
1835.
the
result
of
these
treaties
were
the
issuance
of
a
patent.
the
first
patent
that
the
united
states
government
ever
gave
to
a
tribe
of
indians
or
it
conveyed
this
land
in
fee
simple
to
the
cherokees
in
1938
and
then
there's
another
patent,
being
second
patent
in
which
united
states
government
have
ever
conveyed
to
fee
simple
title
to
an
indian
tribe
to
the
choctaws
in
1842.
mr.
lon
kile
yes,
i
think
so,
i
think
it
depends.
i
think
that
it
depends
upon
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
the
treaties
and
the
treaties
themselves.
mr.
lon
kile
yes
sir
and
it
is
in
writing
and
they
are
set
out
in
our
briefs.
mr.
lon
kile
and
the
patents,
the
patents
each
convey
a
fee
simple
title.
my
time
has
expired,
i
maybe
excused.
