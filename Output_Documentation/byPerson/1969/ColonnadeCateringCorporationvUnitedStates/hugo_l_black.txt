this
crew,

justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
a
little
disturbed
by
your
reference
to
the
crew
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
worked
over
shift?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
determining
whether
a
cert
was
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
exception,
i'm
talking
about
the
interpretation
of
the
word
unreasonable
searches.
can
you
see
no
difference
searching
of
a
private
home
far
moved
from
anybody
else
and
a
searching
of
a
place
where
they
sell
liquor,
whether
it's
a
reasonableness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
there
programs
mr.
feit
for
periodic
inspections
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
in
other
words
have
any
routine
inspection
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
anybody
live
in
this
cellar
downstairs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
it
a
little
difficult
to
compare
what's
reasonable
in
connection
with
a
private
home
and
what
is
necessarily
reasonable
in
connection
with
the
place
of
business
where
they're
selling
liquor
or
dope?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
long
as
we
get
from
either
side,
there's
no
reason
on
the
earth
talking
about
a
home
in
connection
with
this
place
of
business?
