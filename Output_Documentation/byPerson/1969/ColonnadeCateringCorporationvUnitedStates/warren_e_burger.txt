was

chief

well,
then
what
does

have
to
do
with

i
wondered
what
was
the
nexus
between
the
point
you
were
making
and
the
issue
in

chief

e.

but
your
point
would
be
the
same
whether
he
had
a
license
or
whether

didn't
have

wouldn't
it?
chief

e.

mr.
rogge,
while
we
have
you
stopped
for
a
moment,
let
me
suggest
a
possible
hypothetical,
possibly
a
parallel.
the
government
grants
licenses
to
on
a
very
limited
basis
as
we
know
for
the
production
of
atomic
energy
privately.
somewhere
in
that
statutory
scheme,
there
are
broad
provisions
for
inspection
of
the
premises
producing
the
atomic
energy
obviously
on
a
safety
basis,
i
would
assume
that's
the
basis.
would
you
say
that
the
government
inspectors
with
the
statute
permitting
them
to
inspect
at
any
time
must
have
a
warrant
before
they
can
enter
any
part
of
the
premises
where
atomic
energy
is
being
produced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
this
right
of
privacy
extended
with
the
same
force
to
people
who
are
granted
a
special
license
to
engage
in
activities
that
the
generality
of
people
are
denied
as
it
does
to
private
homes
and
other
circumstances?
chief

warren
e.

i
meant
the
--
chief

up

they
have
been
confronted
with
committing
a
felony
if
they
refused,
haven't
they?

and
that's
perhaps
had
a
tendency
to
induce

the

of

that

don't
suggest

to
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
in
their

--
chief

that

does

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
what
might
be
important
in
the
area
that
justice
stewart
was
probing
at
is
whether
if
a
potential
costumer
who
wanted
to
make
an
arrangement
for
a
party
to
be
catered
a
week
later
could
walk
in
the
door
without
ringing
or
knocking
and
negotiate
with
someone
to
arrange
that
affair.
now,
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
statute
is
limited,
is
it
not?
chief

warren
e.

is

--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
limited
to
people
who
hold
the
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
statute,
the
operation
of
the
statute
is
limited
to
the
licensed
operators
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
private
homes
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice
that
in
your
brief,
you
have
not
made
any
analogy
to
the
bank
examiners.
now,
i
suppose
it's
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
that
bank
examiner
systems
exist
all
over
and
when
the
bank
examiners
come
in
the
bank
during
banking
hours,
they
usually
come
in
in
teams,
one
of
them
goes
to
the
main
cash
drawer
and
one
of
them
goes
somewhere
else
and
they
immediately
move
in
take
over.
is
there
any
holding
anywhere
that
said
that
they
have
to
have
a
warrant
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
warrant
is
--
the
substitute
for
the
warrant
is
the
statute
giving
them
the
authority
to
inspect
licensed
banks
or
the
chartered
banks.
chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

chief

warren
e.

mr.

do
you
care
to
comment
on
the
possible
analogy,
the
validity
of
any
analogy
between
the
bank
examiner
walking
in
and
the
liquor
examiner
walking
in
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
confinement
to
the
big
vault
which
almost
every
bank
has
where
they
keep
the
cash
which
is
the
business
function
and
the
banker
refuses
to
let
them
go
in
to
the
vault.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
know
the
whole
statutory
scheme
providing
for
bank
examination
is
that
the
examiners
must
take
the
banker
by
surprise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
if
you
were
addressing
that
relating
it
to
the
bank
examiner,
the
bank
examiner's
function
is
as
you
agree
to
catch
the
banker
by
surprise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
to
see
whether
the
books
and
the

and
all
of

things
balance

for

purpose

chief

e.

i
was
confining
my
analogy,
my
hypothetical
case
to
the
main
vault.
now,
if
you
were
to
suggest
that
a
warrant
have
to
be
obtained,
what
would
the
bank
examiner
present
to
the
magistrate
as
justification
for
the
warrant
except
for
the
statutory
authority
to
make
the
inspection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
that
5146
in
itself
would
be
enough
if
the
revenue
agents
went
to
the

and
said
here
is
the
statute
which
allows
us
to
inspect

we
want

o'clock

o'clock
in

chief

would
be

to

chief

can
i
come

my
another
question?
suppose
he

no

merely
presented

this
statutory
provision
said
under

statute,
we

please
give

a

would
the

be
justified
in
giving
