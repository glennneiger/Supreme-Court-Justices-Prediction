mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
should
have
before
it
in
addition
to
the
single
appendix
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
government's
brief,
a
blue
back
petitioner's
reply
brief.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
premises
of
those
whose
services
include
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
are
outside
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
says
they
are,
we
say
they
are
not.
the
government
points
to
inspection
statutes,
we
point
to
the
provisions
for
a
warrant
procedure.
the
government
points
to
the
age
of
the
inspection
provisions,
we
point
to
the
fact
that
there
has
consistently
been
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure.
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
there
isn't
a
dispute,
on
a
saturday
afternoon,
a
crew
of
four,
three
internal
revenue
agents
and
nassau
county
policeman
came
in
to
the
petitioner's
premises
and
demanded
to
inspect.
the
petitioner
as
a
caterer
who
as
part
of
his
service
dispenses
liquor
and
therefore
has
a
federal
occupational
liquor
dealer
stamp
that
costs
him
$54.00.
after
inspecting
the
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
my
understanding
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
after
they
had
inspected
the
public
premises,
they
demanded
to
see
the
non-public
premises
and
without
permission
they
did
that
going
into
the
basement
and
then
this
crew
of
four
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
three
officers
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
one
nassau
county
policeman,
patrolman,
they
were
officers.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
there
were
four
people
mr.
justice
black
that
i
think
in
this
case
were
engaged
in
the
kind
of
a
general
exploratory
search
which
was
one
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
american
revolution
and
which
subsequently
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that's
what
i
think
happened
in
this
case.
now,
after
inspecting
the
public
premises
and
going
into
the
basement,
they
were
later
joined
by
a
district
area
supervisor,
so
you
now
have
five
individuals
who
demanded
entrance
to
a
locked
liquor
storeroom
which
was
75
feet
off
the
main
premises.
they
had
no
warrant,
they
claimed
under
the
inspection
statutes.
they
were
entitled
to
go
in,
the
petitioner
refused,
they
then
broke
the
lock
and
entered
and
seized
53
bottles
of
liquor,
some
filled,
some
partially
filled
and
two
funnels.
now,
as
to
the
53
bottles
of
liquor
they
seized
38
of
those
and
this
their
own
receipt
states
which
is
at
pages
11
(a)
to
13
(a)
to
determine
if
genuine.
they
seized
15
more
bottles
according
to
their
own
receipt
as
a
comparative
sample
and
they
seized
two
funnels
and
they
specifically
stated
that
they
seized
those
for
evidence.
they
said
that
in
so
many
words.
now,
they
were
not
engaged
in
seeking
to
collect
any
taxes
because
the
petitioner
paid
its
$54.00.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
they
weren't
seeking
to
collect
taxes.
no
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
what
i
really
want
to
emphasize
all
the
way
through
is
that
this
was
a
general
exploratory
search
for
evidence
and
it
was
done
without
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i
assume
that
he
has
to
hang
that
license
in
the
public
premises
and
the
premises
were
open
and
they
could
walk
in
and
if
they
came
in
to
see
that
he
had
the
license,
they
didn't
come
in
for
that
purpose,
we
wouldn't
have
any
objection
about
that
nor
were
they
looking
for
a
distillery.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
i
can't
answer
because
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
it
does
show
that
they
broke
the
lock.
here,
what
we
have
to
rely
on
is
the
petitioner's
affidavit,
there's
nothing
in
the
government's
affidavit
in
opposition,
it's
simply
a
general
statement
to
which
you
have
added
one
thing.
in
argument
before
district
judge
weinstein,
government
counsel,
and
this
is
at
pages
31
(a)
and
32
(a),
states
that
one
of
these
very
agents
was
at
a
(inaudible)
there
the
weekend
before
and
he
saw
what
looked
to
him
to
have
been
refilled
bottles
and
so
he
went
and
put
in
a
routine
complaint
which
was
being
acted
on
this
following
saturday.
now,
that's
all
there
is
in
the
record,
the
petition
does
say
they
broke
in.
now,
what
particular
implement
they
used
to
break
they
did
break
a
lock,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
that
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
and
this
is
at
their
brief
page
30
note
26,
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
where
force
has
been
used
to
gain
entry
to
the
premises
of
a
retail
liquor
dealer.
so,
force
was
used
but
whether
it
was
a
hammer
or
whether
it
was
crowbar
that
i
can't
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
i
don't
know
whether
they
picked
up
a
chair
or
something
there
to
break
it
open.
there
isn't
any
dispute
but
force
was
used
to
break
open
--
to
break
the
lock,
break
open
the
door.
now,
they
weren't
seeking
to
look
for
an
elicit
distillery
because
if
they
had
been
doing
that,
there
is
an
expressed
statutory
provision
which
says
that
it
shall
be
lawful
for
them
to
use
such
a
force
to
gain
entry
as
maybe
necessary.
now,
whatever
maybe
the
constitutional
status
of
that
provision
its
there,
they
weren't
operating
under
that.
they
were
simply
as
i
have
stated
and
i
can
emphasize
it
too
much
they
were
engaged
in
a
general
exploratory
search
of
the
kind
that
was
one
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
american
revolution
and
which
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
contains
no
exceptions.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
was
stated
in
argument
before
judge
weinstein
and
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
that's
part
of
the
record
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
government's
affidavit
in
opposition
which
says
anything
about
that,
that's
simply
a
statement
of
government
counsel
before
judge
weinstein
and
if
true,
then
i
say
the
government
had
a
whole
week
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
it
does
that
too
but
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
right,
and
they
had
a
public
part
of
the
premises
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
bar
mitzvah,
the
saturday
before
and
there
a
bar
mitzvah
the
saturday
afternoon
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
when
these
agents
and
the
patrolman
and
still
a
group
of
four,
however
i
characterize
them,
i
tried
to
find
a
word
that
was
as
mild
as
possible
and
that's
why
i
called
them
a
crew
of
four
but
there
was
a
group
of
four
and
they
were
joined
by
a
supervisor,
so
at
the
time
that
they
broke
open
the
door
there
were
five
of
them
demanding
entry
and
without
a
warrant.
now,
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
i
don't
get
into
that
part.
the
way
have
handled
that
is
in
the
reply
brief
in
which
i
quote
from
camara
against
municipal
court.
now,
did
the
government
counsel
say
that
warrant
procedure
couldn't
be
used
because
well,
they
go
into
various
reasons
for
that.
one
of
them
is
that
they've
been
advised
by
the
north
atlantic
and
mid
atlantic
regions
that
these
inspections
are
based
on
some
reason
to
believe
or
suspect
less
than
probable
cause,
i
don't
think
that's
in
here.
i
in
response
to
that
point
out
from
a
paragraph
in
the
court's
opinion
in
camara
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
for
probable
cause
will
vary
with
the
type
of
case
involved.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
in
other
words
and
again
i'm
taking
it
not
from
any
affidavit
but
from
a
statement
and
argument
before
judge
weinstein
that
one
of
the
agents
had
been
there
at
the
briefs,
seeding
saturday
and
i
had
seen
would
look
to
him
like
refilled
bottles.
now,
neither
side
is
gone
to
what
amounts
to
probable
cause
but
that
certainly
seems
to
me
to
be
enough
probable
cause
to
go
and
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
as
to
the
public
part
of
the
premises
in
the
day
time
they
could
walk
in
but
if
they
wanted
to
break
in
to
something
then
i
would
say
yes
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
varying
with
the
type
of
case
which
would
have
been
enough
for
a
warrant
issue,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
that's
not
enough.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
the
premises
are
open,
they
can
walk
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
but
if
they
want
to
make
a
search
which
is
what
these
gentlemen
five
in
number
wanted
to
do,
yes,
they
have
to
go
before
a
judge
which
satisfies
this
detached
official
rather
than
the
agent
in
the
field
and
get
a
warrant
to
do
that.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
as
i
read,
camara
against
municipal
court
was
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
would
vary
with
the
particular
type
of
case
and
that
would
surely
be
true
of
the
administrative
inspections
that
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
engaged
in
this
inspection
would
have
to
supply.
now,
neither
brief
has
gone
in
but
just
how
that
would
be
spelled
out
in
this
particular
case,
i
haven't
spelled
it
out
and
neither
has
the
government.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
i
answer
that
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
comparable
provision
in
the
case
of
distilleries
where
the
statute
provides
that
agents
may
enter
--
the
government
agents
are
supposed
to
have
a
key
to
distilleries,
they
may
go
in
at
any
time
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
entry
is
denied
they
may
use
necessary
force
without
a
warrant
to
get
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
entirely
apart
from
the
question
of
--
if
you
would
add
to
your
case
that
the
statute
also
says
in
the
case
of
these
atomic
plants
that
agents
may
enter
and
i
mean
if
you'll
make
the
case
comparable
to
that
of
distilleries
and
say
that
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
entry
is
denied
they
may
use
force
to
enter,
i
would
say
that
i
would
have
a
great
deal
of
that
about
the
constitutionality
of
that
but
i
would
equally
say
in
this
case
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
structure,
you'd
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
under
this
inspection
statute,
that
result
wouldn't
follow
because
under
this
inspection
statute,
there
are
provisions
for
forfeiture
of
$500.00
for
each
refusal.
there's
another
provision
making
it
a
felony
to
obstruct
internal
revenue
agents
in
carrying
out
their
duties
but
where
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
warrant
procedure,
it
specifically
so
provided
and
so
it
provided
and
this
provision
goes
back,
it
was
in
the
1791
act,
it's
in
the
revised
statute
and
it's
in
the
current
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
it's
in
26
usc
section
7302
which
provides
a
search.
if
property
is
used
or
maybe
used
or
has
been
used
in
violation
of
the
revenue
laws
specifically
provides
a
search
warrant
may
issue
as
provided
in
chapter
205
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
now,
there's
also
a
provision
in
two
instances
for
the
use
of
force
in
the
congressional
statute.
there's
one
in
the
criminal
code
18
usc
section
3109
which
provides
for
the
use
of
necessary
force
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant,
and
there's
another
provision,
there's
one
with
reference
to
distilleries
which
provides
for
the
use
of
necessary
force
without
a
warrant
for
the
entry
of
a
distillery,
but
there
is
no
such
provision
with
reference
to
these
inspection
statutes
and
i
say
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
this
is
now
a
part
from
the
fourth
amendment
but
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
if
you
look
at
this
statutory
scheme,
congress
never
intended
the
use
of
force
if
entry
was
denied.
they
intended
the
use
of
a
warrant
procedure
and
there
is
specific
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure.
now,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
atomic
energy
provisions
but
i
would
say
this
that
if
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
entry
without
a
warrant
by
the
use
of
force
if
necessary,
you'd
have
something
that's
comparable
to
what
we
have
with
reference
to
distilleries,
i
would
doubt
its
constitutionality
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
i'll
explain
in
a
moment
why.
and
if
you
had
also
in
that
statute
a
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure,
i
might
form
an
opinion
looking
at
the
statutory
scheme,
i
would
if
i
could
come
up
by
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
protected
it
i
would
and
i
would
do
that
for
this
reason.
for
the
past
300
years
and
more,
these
people
had
build
up
a
right
of
privacy
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
1813
called
the
right
to
be
let
alone
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
say
yes
if
possible
unless
i
found
in
the
statutory
scheme
as
i
do
with
reference
to
distilleries,
a
specific
provision
that
they
may
enter
without
a
warrant
by
force
if
necessary
but
i
would
look
for
a
provision
like
that
and
not
only
because
we
have
build
up
this
right
of
privacy
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
as
an
expression
but
you
had
another
development
which
began
really
in
1864
and
that
is
giving
to
administrative
officials
that
began
with
a
federal
tax
assessor
in
1864
giving
them
power
to
issue
a
subpoena
or
power
to
make
inspections
or
both.
there
are
now
over
two
dozen
federal
administrative
agencies
which
have
either
the
power
of
subpoena
or
the
power
of
inspection
of
both
and
i
say
in
the
face
of
that
trend,
it
is
necessary
not
to
make
them
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
where
all
that
you
have
are
inspection
statutes
and
where
in
that
same
statutory
scheme
you
have
a
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure
as
you
do,
you'd
have
a
provision
for
a
forfeiture
if
there
is
a
refusal
and
you'll
have
two
provisions
for
the
use
of
force,
one
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant
and
one
where
you
want
to
enter
a
distillery,
neither
of
which
are
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
the
impression
that
they
resort
to
a
warrant
procedure
but
i
haven't
covered
that
field
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
but
i
do
want
to
make
another
point
in
that
connection.
with
reference
to
applying
the
warrant
procedure
in
this
case
which
the
government
says
would
be
so
burdensome.
according
to
the
government's
own
brief,
the
government
conducts
thousands
of
inspections.
according
to
the
government's
brief
there
are
some
300,000
liquor
dealers
in
the
country.
in
1963,
they
made
24,000
inspections.
in
1964,
they
made
23,000.
in
1965,
they
made
13,000.
apparently,
the
numbers
of
inspections
are
going
down
but
that's
still
more
than
60,000
inspections
over
a
three-year
period
and
what
does
the
government
say
in
its
own
brief?
they
say
very
few
of
these
dealers
refuse
consent
to
an
inspection.
they
go
on
to
point
out
in
a
footnote
that
the
estimate
of
the
refusal
rate
in
the
north
atlantic
region
was
one
out
of
75.
they
say
that
the
area
supervisors
of
the
mid
atlantic
region
could
not
recall
any
refusals
or
objections.
now,
they
don't
tell
us
what
happened
in
that
one
out
of
75.
they
don't
tell
us
whether
they
went
and
got
a
warrant
but
they
do
say
this
in
footnote
26
on
page
30,
that
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
in
which
force
has
been
used.
now,
it
can't
be
so
important
to
have
an
inspection
procedure
without
a
warrant
procedure,
if
that's
what
the
picture
is.
they
don't
need
to
convert
warrants
into
--
they
don't
need
to
convert
inspection
procedures
into
general
warrants
in
order
to
carry
out
their
duties.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
don't
know
about
that
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
i
don't
know
how
many
knew
this,
i
didn't
know
this
until
i
saw
the
government's
brief
that
it
was
a
felony
but
there
are
ample
tools
to
deal
with
those
who
refuse
access
to
private
premises
and
what
i'm
really
asking
for
here
is
not
to
make
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment,
i
don't
think
the
framers
intended
it.
the
framers
in
just
so
many
words
said
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
as
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
i
think
if
they
wanted
to
make
an
exception
for
liquor
dealers
or
for
distilleries,
they
would
have
said
so,
they
didn't.
and
then
they
go
on
to
provide
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
there
were
liquor
dealers?
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
your
honor
please,
i
see
no
such
exception
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
the
standard
for
the
reasonableness
would
vary,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
but
if
it
was
at
night
for
instance
and
those
premises
were
closed,
the
fact
that
liquor
is
sold
there,
i
don't
think
gives
them
warrant
to
go
in
or
if
the
owner
should
close
his
establishment,
he
has
a
public
place
to
dispense
liquor
and
he's
closed
his
establishment.
i
don't
think
that
the
agents
without
a
warrant
can
go
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
says
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
says
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
the
facts
but
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
now
have
see
against
city
of
seattle
which
says
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
commercial
premises
and
what
i'm
urging
is,
what
i'm
urging
in
the
first
place
is
that
this
court
at
this
late
date
should
not
breathe
an
exception
into
the
fourth
amendment
which
says
that
those
who
as
part
of
their
services
dispense
liquor,
their
premises
are
without
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
i
say
in
the
second
place,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
this
statutory
scheme
in
this
case
provided
merely
for
going
in
and
inspecting.
the
same
statutory
procedure
also
had
a
warrant
procedure
and
that
procedure
should
be
held
applicable
particularly
in
this
day
of
the
great
number
of
administrative
agency,
they
should
be
told
likewise,
you
must
abide
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
wish
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
that,
going
to
do
it
last
but
i'll
do
it
first.
then,
i
suppose
that
the
president
of
that
bank
has
locked
in
his
desk,
in
his
office
certain
papers
and
those
bank
examiners
want
to
go
in
that
locked
desk,
i
would
say
there
they
would
have
to
go
and
get
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
answering
that
without
further
study
because
i
feel
that
we
should
extend
the
right
of
privacy
rather
than
restrict
it
and
i
would
look
for
ways,
i
would
look
at
that
statutes
and
if
there
was
anything
in
the
statutes
as
much
as
there
are
in
these
statutes
where
there
is
a
warrant
procedure,
i
haven't
studied
these
banks
statute
but
if
i
found
that
there
was
any
indication
in
any
of
the
statutory
provisions
relating
to
them
that
they
should
get
a
warrant
then
i
should
say
the
warrant
procedure
should
be
applicable.
but
i
haven't
studied
them
enough
so
that
i
can
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
absolutely
correct
and
it's
the
same
way
with
distilleries
where
there
is
a
specific
provision
however
that
they
may
use
force.
i'd
have
to
study
the
banking
statutes.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
asked
about
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
i
find
in
the
government's
brief,
my
associate
called
my
attention
to
it
but
i
remember
that
i
had
read
it,
in
footnote
23
in
the
second
paragraph
where
they
say,
we
are
advised
that
when
food
and
drug
administration
inspectors
are
denied
entry,
they
seek
to
obtain
a
warrant
before
returning
to
the
premises
sought
to
be
inspected.
now,
you
also
asked
about
the
premises,
i
think
we've
given
you
as
much
help
as
we
can
on
that
although
i
did
notice
in
looking
at
the
petition
in
paragraph
one,
the
petitioner
does
allege
that
this
is
his
principal
place
of
business
and
that's
engaged
in
the
catering
business,
i
think
it
does
mean
that
you
come
and
engage,
this
is
his
private
property
and
the
people
are
there
in
a
private
party.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
specifically
how
they
broke
in
and
i
went
through
the
record
again
while
i
was
listening
to
the
government's
argument
and
i
see
on
page
21
(a)
of
the
appendix,
says
the
investigators
forcibly
broke
into
the
storeroom
actually
tearing
the
door
latch
from
the
door
frame,
but
that's
specific
as
i
can
be
on
that.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
want
to
come
back
to
your
example
of
the
bank.
i
know
that
bank
examiners
are
supposed
to
take
the
bank
by
surprise
but
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
whole
statutory
scheme
and
if
there
is
some
way
that
i
could
argue
that
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
procedure
should
be
applicable
i
would
do
so
because
i
think
in
accordance
with
our
own
courts
as
a
people
or
to
borrow
the
phrase
of
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
we
continue
as
a
maturing
society
which
he
used
in
trump
against
dallas,
in
this
day
of
these
proliferating
administrative
agencies,
if
i
could
find
an
argument
that
i
could
make
with
my
heart
i
would
make
it
that
there
should
be
a
certain
area
that's
safeguarded
to
the
individual
free
from
intrusion
by
the
state
unless
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
it
and
that
surely
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
correct
and
i
have
to
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
--
have
to
repeat
the
case
that
i
put
to
your
honor,
suppose
he
had
some
locked
things
in
his
desk
now
that's
on
the
bank
premises,
could
they
break
in
there,
they
say
well,
we
want
to
examine,
we're
entitled
to
examine.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
that
instance
he
might
not
have
any,
in
this
instance
he
did.
so
they
say,
he
said
he
was
there
the
week
before,
you'll
find
this
at
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
your
honor
please
and
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
enforce
this
statutory
scheme
and
certainly
not
in
this
particular
case
where
an
agent
or
where
the
government
states
an
argument
before
the
trial
judge
here.
one
of
these
very
agent
was
--
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
31
(a)
top
of
32
(a),
was
that
a
bar
mitzvah
there
the
weekend
before
and
he
saw
what
looked
to
him
to
have
been
refilled
bottles
and
so
he
went
and
put
in
a
routine
complaint.
now,
if
this
is
true
and
this
is
the
statement
of
the
united
states
attorney,
then
i
say
he
had
probable
cause
and
a
week
in
which
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
should
have
before
it
in
addition
to
the
single
appendix
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
government's
brief,
a
blue
back
petitioner's
reply
brief.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
premises
of
those
whose
services
include
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
are
outside
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
says
they
are,
we
say
they
are
not.
the
government
points
to
inspection
statutes,
we
point
to
the
provisions
for
a
warrant
procedure.
the
government
points
to
the
age
of
the
inspection
provisions,
we
point
to
the
fact
that
there
has
consistently
been
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure.
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
there
isn't
a
dispute,
on
a
saturday
afternoon,
a
crew
of
four,
three
internal
revenue
agents
and
nassau
county
policeman
came
in
to
the
petitioner's
premises
and
demanded
to
inspect.
the
petitioner
as
a
caterer
who
as
part
of
his
service
dispenses
liquor
and
therefore
has
a
federal
occupational
liquor
dealer
stamp
that
costs
him
$54.00.
after
inspecting
the
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
my
understanding
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
after
they
had
inspected
the
public
premises,
they
demanded
to
see
the
non-public
premises
and
without
permission
they
did
that
going
into
the
basement
and
then
this
crew
of
four
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
three
officers
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
one
nassau
county
policeman,
patrolman,
they
were
officers.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
there
were
four
people
mr.
justice
black
that
i
think
in
this
case
were
engaged
in
the
kind
of
a
general
exploratory
search
which
was
one
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
american
revolution
and
which
subsequently
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that's
what
i
think
happened
in
this
case.
now,
after
inspecting
the
public
premises
and
going
into
the
basement,
they
were
later
joined
by
a
district
area
supervisor,
so
you
now
have
five
individuals
who
demanded
entrance
to
a
locked
liquor
storeroom
which
was
75
feet
off
the
main
premises.
they
had
no
warrant,
they
claimed
under
the
inspection
statutes.
they
were
entitled
to
go
in,
the
petitioner
refused,
they
then
broke
the
lock
and
entered
and
seized
53
bottles
of
liquor,
some
filled,
some
partially
filled
and
two
funnels.
now,
as
to
the
53
bottles
of
liquor
they
seized
38
of
those
and
this
their
own
receipt
states
which
is
at
pages
11
(a)
to
13
(a)
to
determine
if
genuine.
they
seized
15
more
bottles
according
to
their
own
receipt
as
a
comparative
sample
and
they
seized
two
funnels
and
they
specifically
stated
that
they
seized
those
for
evidence.
they
said
that
in
so
many
words.
now,
they
were
not
engaged
in
seeking
to
collect
any
taxes
because
the
petitioner
paid
its
$54.00.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
they
weren't
seeking
to
collect
taxes.
no
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
what
i
really
want
to
emphasize
all
the
way
through
is
that
this
was
a
general
exploratory
search
for
evidence
and
it
was
done
without
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i
assume
that
he
has
to
hang
that
license
in
the
public
premises
and
the
premises
were
open
and
they
could
walk
in
and
if
they
came
in
to
see
that
he
had
the
license,
they
didn't
come
in
for
that
purpose,
we
wouldn't
have
any
objection
about
that
nor
were
they
looking
for
a
distillery.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
i
can't
answer
because
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
it
does
show
that
they
broke
the
lock.
here,
what
we
have
to
rely
on
is
the
petitioner's
affidavit,
there's
nothing
in
the
government's
affidavit
in
opposition,
it's
simply
a
general
statement
to
which
you
have
added
one
thing.
in
argument
before
district
judge
weinstein,
government
counsel,
and
this
is
at
pages
31
(a)
and
32
(a),
states
that
one
of
these
very
agents
was
at
a
(inaudible)
there
the
weekend
before
and
he
saw
what
looked
to
him
to
have
been
refilled
bottles
and
so
he
went
and
put
in
a
routine
complaint
which
was
being
acted
on
this
following
saturday.
now,
that's
all
there
is
in
the
record,
the
petition
does
say
they
broke
in.
now,
what
particular
implement
they
used
to
break
they
did
break
a
lock,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
that
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
and
this
is
at
their
brief
page
30
note
26,
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
where
force
has
been
used
to
gain
entry
to
the
premises
of
a
retail
liquor
dealer.
so,
force
was
used
but
whether
it
was
a
hammer
or
whether
it
was
crowbar
that
i
can't
tell
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
i
don't
know
whether
they
picked
up
a
chair
or
something
there
to
break
it
open.
there
isn't
any
dispute
but
force
was
used
to
break
open
--
to
break
the
lock,
break
open
the
door.
now,
they
weren't
seeking
to
look
for
an
elicit
distillery
because
if
they
had
been
doing
that,
there
is
an
expressed
statutory
provision
which
says
that
it
shall
be
lawful
for
them
to
use
such
a
force
to
gain
entry
as
maybe
necessary.
now,
whatever
maybe
the
constitutional
status
of
that
provision
its
there,
they
weren't
operating
under
that.
they
were
simply
as
i
have
stated
and
i
can
emphasize
it
too
much
they
were
engaged
in
a
general
exploratory
search
of
the
kind
that
was
one
of
the
factors
involved
in
the
american
revolution
and
which
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
contains
no
exceptions.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
was
stated
in
argument
before
judge
weinstein
and
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
that's
part
of
the
record
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
government's
affidavit
in
opposition
which
says
anything
about
that,
that's
simply
a
statement
of
government
counsel
before
judge
weinstein
and
if
true,
then
i
say
the
government
had
a
whole
week
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
it
does
that
too
but
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
right,
and
they
had
a
public
part
of
the
premises
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
bar
mitzvah,
the
saturday
before
and
there
a
bar
mitzvah
the
saturday
afternoon
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
when
these
agents
and
the
patrolman
and
still
a
group
of
four,
however
i
characterize
them,
i
tried
to
find
a
word
that
was
as
mild
as
possible
and
that's
why
i
called
them
a
crew
of
four
but
there
was
a
group
of
four
and
they
were
joined
by
a
supervisor,
so
at
the
time
that
they
broke
open
the
door
there
were
five
of
them
demanding
entry
and
without
a
warrant.
now,
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
i
don't
get
into
that
part.
the
way
have
handled
that
is
in
the
reply
brief
in
which
i
quote
from
camara
against
municipal
court.
now,
did
the
government
counsel
say
that
warrant
procedure
couldn't
be
used
because
well,
they
go
into
various
reasons
for
that.
one
of
them
is
that
they've
been
advised
by
the
north
atlantic
and
mid
atlantic
regions
that
these
inspections
are
based
on
some
reason
to
believe
or
suspect
less
than
probable
cause,
i
don't
think
that's
in
here.
i
in
response
to
that
point
out
from
a
paragraph
in
the
court's
opinion
in
camara
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
for
probable
cause
will
vary
with
the
type
of
case
involved.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
in
other
words
and
again
i'm
taking
it
not
from
any
affidavit
but
from
a
statement
and
argument
before
judge
weinstein
that
one
of
the
agents
had
been
there
at
the
briefs,
seeding
saturday
and
i
had
seen
would
look
to
him
like
refilled
bottles.
now,
neither
side
is
gone
to
what
amounts
to
probable
cause
but
that
certainly
seems
to
me
to
be
enough
probable
cause
to
go
and
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
as
to
the
public
part
of
the
premises
in
the
day
time
they
could
walk
in
but
if
they
wanted
to
break
in
to
something
then
i
would
say
yes
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
varying
with
the
type
of
case
which
would
have
been
enough
for
a
warrant
issue,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
that's
not
enough.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
the
premises
are
open,
they
can
walk
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
but
if
they
want
to
make
a
search
which
is
what
these
gentlemen
five
in
number
wanted
to
do,
yes,
they
have
to
go
before
a
judge
which
satisfies
this
detached
official
rather
than
the
agent
in
the
field
and
get
a
warrant
to
do
that.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
as
i
read,
camara
against
municipal
court
was
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
would
vary
with
the
particular
type
of
case
and
that
would
surely
be
true
of
the
administrative
inspections
that
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
engaged
in
this
inspection
would
have
to
supply.
now,
neither
brief
has
gone
in
but
just
how
that
would
be
spelled
out
in
this
particular
case,
i
haven't
spelled
it
out
and
neither
has
the
government.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
i
answer
that
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
comparable
provision
in
the
case
of
distilleries
where
the
statute
provides
that
agents
may
enter
--
the
government
agents
are
supposed
to
have
a
key
to
distilleries,
they
may
go
in
at
any
time
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
entry
is
denied
they
may
use
necessary
force
without
a
warrant
to
get
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
now,
entirely
apart
from
the
question
of
--
if
you
would
add
to
your
case
that
the
statute
also
says
in
the
case
of
these
atomic
plants
that
agents
may
enter
and
i
mean
if
you'll
make
the
case
comparable
to
that
of
distilleries
and
say
that
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
entry
is
denied
they
may
use
force
to
enter,
i
would
say
that
i
would
have
a
great
deal
of
that
about
the
constitutionality
of
that
but
i
would
equally
say
in
this
case
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
structure,
you'd
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
under
this
inspection
statute,
that
result
wouldn't
follow
because
under
this
inspection
statute,
there
are
provisions
for
forfeiture
of
$500.00
for
each
refusal.
there's
another
provision
making
it
a
felony
to
obstruct
internal
revenue
agents
in
carrying
out
their
duties
but
where
the
congress
had
in
mind
a
warrant
procedure,
it
specifically
so
provided
and
so
it
provided
and
this
provision
goes
back,
it
was
in
the
1791
act,
it's
in
the
revised
statute
and
it's
in
the
current
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
it's
in
26
usc
section
7302
which
provides
a
search.
if
property
is
used
or
maybe
used
or
has
been
used
in
violation
of
the
revenue
laws
specifically
provides
a
search
warrant
may
issue
as
provided
in
chapter
205
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
now,
there's
also
a
provision
in
two
instances
for
the
use
of
force
in
the
congressional
statute.
there's
one
in
the
criminal
code
18
usc
section
3109
which
provides
for
the
use
of
necessary
force
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant,
and
there's
another
provision,
there's
one
with
reference
to
distilleries
which
provides
for
the
use
of
necessary
force
without
a
warrant
for
the
entry
of
a
distillery,
but
there
is
no
such
provision
with
reference
to
these
inspection
statutes
and
i
say
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
this
is
now
a
part
from
the
fourth
amendment
but
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
if
you
look
at
this
statutory
scheme,
congress
never
intended
the
use
of
force
if
entry
was
denied.
they
intended
the
use
of
a
warrant
procedure
and
there
is
specific
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure.
now,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
atomic
energy
provisions
but
i
would
say
this
that
if
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
entry
without
a
warrant
by
the
use
of
force
if
necessary,
you'd
have
something
that's
comparable
to
what
we
have
with
reference
to
distilleries,
i
would
doubt
its
constitutionality
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
i'll
explain
in
a
moment
why.
and
if
you
had
also
in
that
statute
a
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure,
i
might
form
an
opinion
looking
at
the
statutory
scheme,
i
would
if
i
could
come
up
by
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
protected
it
i
would
and
i
would
do
that
for
this
reason.
for
the
past
300
years
and
more,
these
people
had
build
up
a
right
of
privacy
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
1813
called
the
right
to
be
let
alone
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
say
yes
if
possible
unless
i
found
in
the
statutory
scheme
as
i
do
with
reference
to
distilleries,
a
specific
provision
that
they
may
enter
without
a
warrant
by
force
if
necessary
but
i
would
look
for
a
provision
like
that
and
not
only
because
we
have
build
up
this
right
of
privacy
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
as
an
expression
but
you
had
another
development
which
began
really
in
1864
and
that
is
giving
to
administrative
officials
that
began
with
a
federal
tax
assessor
in
1864
giving
them
power
to
issue
a
subpoena
or
power
to
make
inspections
or
both.
there
are
now
over
two
dozen
federal
administrative
agencies
which
have
either
the
power
of
subpoena
or
the
power
of
inspection
of
both
and
i
say
in
the
face
of
that
trend,
it
is
necessary
not
to
make
them
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
where
all
that
you
have
are
inspection
statutes
and
where
in
that
same
statutory
scheme
you
have
a
provision
for
a
warrant
procedure
as
you
do,
you'd
have
a
provision
for
a
forfeiture
if
there
is
a
refusal
and
you'll
have
two
provisions
for
the
use
of
force,
one
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant
and
one
where
you
want
to
enter
a
distillery,
neither
of
which
are
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
the
impression
that
they
resort
to
a
warrant
procedure
but
i
haven't
covered
that
field
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
but
i
do
want
to
make
another
point
in
that
connection.
with
reference
to
applying
the
warrant
procedure
in
this
case
which
the
government
says
would
be
so
burdensome.
according
to
the
government's
own
brief,
the
government
conducts
thousands
of
inspections.
according
to
the
government's
brief
there
are
some
300,000
liquor
dealers
in
the
country.
in
1963,
they
made
24,000
inspections.
in
1964,
they
made
23,000.
in
1965,
they
made
13,000.
apparently,
the
numbers
of
inspections
are
going
down
but
that's
still
more
than
60,000
inspections
over
a
three-year
period
and
what
does
the
government
say
in
its
own
brief?
they
say
very
few
of
these
dealers
refuse
consent
to
an
inspection.
they
go
on
to
point
out
in
a
footnote
that
the
estimate
of
the
refusal
rate
in
the
north
atlantic
region
was
one
out
of
75.
they
say
that
the
area
supervisors
of
the
mid
atlantic
region
could
not
recall
any
refusals
or
objections.
now,
they
don't
tell
us
what
happened
in
that
one
out
of
75.
they
don't
tell
us
whether
they
went
and
got
a
warrant
but
they
do
say
this
in
footnote
26
on
page
30,
that
this
is
the
only
case
to
their
knowledge
in
which
force
has
been
used.
now,
it
can't
be
so
important
to
have
an
inspection
procedure
without
a
warrant
procedure,
if
that's
what
the
picture
is.
they
don't
need
to
convert
warrants
into
--
they
don't
need
to
convert
inspection
procedures
into
general
warrants
in
order
to
carry
out
their
duties.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
don't
know
about
that
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
i
don't
know
how
many
knew
this,
i
didn't
know
this
until
i
saw
the
government's
brief
that
it
was
a
felony
but
there
are
ample
tools
to
deal
with
those
who
refuse
access
to
private
premises
and
what
i'm
really
asking
for
here
is
not
to
make
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment,
i
don't
think
the
framers
intended
it.
the
framers
in
just
so
many
words
said
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
as
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated.
i
think
if
they
wanted
to
make
an
exception
for
liquor
dealers
or
for
distilleries,
they
would
have
said
so,
they
didn't.
and
then
they
go
on
to
provide
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
there
were
liquor
dealers?
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
your
honor
please,
i
see
no
such
exception
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
the
standard
for
the
reasonableness
would
vary,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
but
if
it
was
at
night
for
instance
and
those
premises
were
closed,
the
fact
that
liquor
is
sold
there,
i
don't
think
gives
them
warrant
to
go
in
or
if
the
owner
should
close
his
establishment,
he
has
a
public
place
to
dispense
liquor
and
he's
closed
his
establishment.
i
don't
think
that
the
agents
without
a
warrant
can
go
in.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
says
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
says
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
the
facts
but
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
now
have
see
against
city
of
seattle
which
says
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
commercial
premises
and
what
i'm
urging
is,
what
i'm
urging
in
the
first
place
is
that
this
court
at
this
late
date
should
not
breathe
an
exception
into
the
fourth
amendment
which
says
that
those
who
as
part
of
their
services
dispense
liquor,
their
premises
are
without
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
i
say
in
the
second
place,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
this
statutory
scheme
in
this
case
provided
merely
for
going
in
and
inspecting.
the
same
statutory
procedure
also
had
a
warrant
procedure
and
that
procedure
should
be
held
applicable
particularly
in
this
day
of
the
great
number
of
administrative
agency,
they
should
be
told
likewise,
you
must
abide
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
wish
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
that,
going
to
do
it
last
but
i'll
do
it
first.
then,
i
suppose
that
the
president
of
that
bank
has
locked
in
his
desk,
in
his
office
certain
papers
and
those
bank
examiners
want
to
go
in
that
locked
desk,
i
would
say
there
they
would
have
to
go
and
get
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
answering
that
without
further
study
because
i
feel
that
we
should
extend
the
right
of
privacy
rather
than
restrict
it
and
i
would
look
for
ways,
i
would
look
at
that
statutes
and
if
there
was
anything
in
the
statutes
as
much
as
there
are
in
these
statutes
where
there
is
a
warrant
procedure,
i
haven't
studied
these
banks
statute
but
if
i
found
that
there
was
any
indication
in
any
of
the
statutory
provisions
relating
to
them
that
they
should
get
a
warrant
then
i
should
say
the
warrant
procedure
should
be
applicable.
but
i
haven't
studied
them
enough
so
that
i
can
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
absolutely
correct
and
it's
the
same
way
with
distilleries
where
there
is
a
specific
provision
however
that
they
may
use
force.
i'd
have
to
study
the
banking
statutes.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
asked
about
the
food
and
drug
administration
and
i
find
in
the
government's
brief,
my
associate
called
my
attention
to
it
but
i
remember
that
i
had
read
it,
in
footnote
23
in
the
second
paragraph
where
they
say,
we
are
advised
that
when
food
and
drug
administration
inspectors
are
denied
entry,
they
seek
to
obtain
a
warrant
before
returning
to
the
premises
sought
to
be
inspected.
now,
you
also
asked
about
the
premises,
i
think
we've
given
you
as
much
help
as
we
can
on
that
although
i
did
notice
in
looking
at
the
petition
in
paragraph
one,
the
petitioner
does
allege
that
this
is
his
principal
place
of
business
and
that's
engaged
in
the
catering
business,
i
think
it
does
mean
that
you
come
and
engage,
this
is
his
private
property
and
the
people
are
there
in
a
private
party.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
specifically
how
they
broke
in
and
i
went
through
the
record
again
while
i
was
listening
to
the
government's
argument
and
i
see
on
page
21
(a)
of
the
appendix,
says
the
investigators
forcibly
broke
into
the
storeroom
actually
tearing
the
door
latch
from
the
door
frame,
but
that's
specific
as
i
can
be
on
that.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
want
to
come
back
to
your
example
of
the
bank.
i
know
that
bank
examiners
are
supposed
to
take
the
bank
by
surprise
but
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
whole
statutory
scheme
and
if
there
is
some
way
that
i
could
argue
that
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
procedure
should
be
applicable
i
would
do
so
because
i
think
in
accordance
with
our
own
courts
as
a
people
or
to
borrow
the
phrase
of
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
we
continue
as
a
maturing
society
which
he
used
in
trump
against
dallas,
in
this
day
of
these
proliferating
administrative
agencies,
if
i
could
find
an
argument
that
i
could
make
with
my
heart
i
would
make
it
that
there
should
be
a
certain
area
that's
safeguarded
to
the
individual
free
from
intrusion
by
the
state
unless
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
it
and
that
surely
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
correct
and
i
have
to
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
--
have
to
repeat
the
case
that
i
put
to
your
honor,
suppose
he
had
some
locked
things
in
his
desk
now
that's
on
the
bank
premises,
could
they
break
in
there,
they
say
well,
we
want
to
examine,
we're
entitled
to
examine.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
that
instance
he
might
not
have
any,
in
this
instance
he
did.
so
they
say,
he
said
he
was
there
the
week
before,
you'll
find
this
at
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
your
honor
please
and
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
enforce
this
statutory
scheme
and
certainly
not
in
this
particular
case
where
an
agent
or
where
the
government
states
an
argument
before
the
trial
judge
here.
one
of
these
very
agent
was
--
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
31
(a)
top
of
32
(a),
was
that
a
bar
mitzvah
there
the
weekend
before
and
he
saw
what
looked
to
him
to
have
been
refilled
bottles
and
so
he
went
and
put
in
a
routine
complaint.
now,
if
this
is
true
and
this
is
the
statement
of
the
united
states
attorney,
then
i
say
he
had
probable
cause
and
a
week
in
which
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
if
your
honor
please.
