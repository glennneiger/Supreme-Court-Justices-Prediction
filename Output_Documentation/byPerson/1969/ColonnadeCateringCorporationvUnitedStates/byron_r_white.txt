do
you
in
any
way
urge
here
that
there
was
not
a
probable
cause?
i
know
you
say
there
should
have
been
a
warrant
even
there
is
probable
cause
but
as
part
of
your
case
there
was
not
a
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
don't
raise
the
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
we
should
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
without
that
incident,
would
you
say
that
there
was
probable
cause
or
would
there
have
to
be
some
specific
evidence
about
a
specific
establishment
to
justify
an
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
liquor
inspectors
could
get
a
warrant
from
a
judge
just
by
telling
the
judge
that
we
want
to
inspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
that
they
are
justified
to
have
a
routine
inspection
of
private
quarters
in
a
liquor
dispenser's
establishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
(inaudible)
said,
is
it
mr.
rogge?
(inaudible)
didn't
require
that
to
get
a
warrant,
you
have
to
have
some
specific
information
about
an
establishment
which
led
you
to
believe
that
there
was
a
violation
on
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
will
assume
that
there
was
a
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
we
don't
know
how
many
would
refuse
if
it
were
decided
that
they
didn't
have
to
let
them
in?
