mr.
rogge,
does
the
record
show
how
they
broke
the
lock?
what
they
used
to
break
the
lock
with?
was
it
something
they
had
or
something
was
on
the
premises?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
my
understanding
that
the
only
thing
the
petitioner
complaints
about
his
privacy
is
the
one
locked
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
not
open
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
did
the
same
series
of
statutes
provide
for
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
in
this
case,
the
colonnade
said
as
of
that
locked
door
that's
my
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
all
this
information
a
week
before,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
this
was
just
a
routine
inspection
that
was
performed
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
seek
a
search
warrant
for
heroine,
is
anything
else
the
magistrate
can
do
other
than
take
the
agent's
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
have
to
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
the
exception
with
whisky?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
all
by
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
is
no
statute
here
that
gives
you
the
right
to
break
and
enter,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
your
position
that
if
you
come
in
to
man's
home
with
his
permission,
you
can
then
break
doors
inside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
case
is,
he
has
no
warrant
and
he
goes
to
the
door
and
says,
“may
i
come
in”,
and
he
says,
“fine
come
on
in”,
and
he
says,
“open
the
bedroom
door”,
and
he
says,
“i
wont”.
that's
my
case
i'm
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
this
agent
went
into
a
private
home
and
says,
“i
want
to
come
in
since
you're
the
owner
of
the
colonnade
company
and
see
if
you
got
any
whisky
bottles
in
here”
and
the
man
says,
“come
on
in”.
there's
a
nice
closet
with
label
on
it,
whisky
bottle
and
he
says,
“i
wont
let
you
in
there”,
he
can
break
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
to
be
that
