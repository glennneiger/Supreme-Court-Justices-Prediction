can
we
take
any
consideration
to
sentence
when
the
constitution
says
he
shall
not
be
tried.
it
didn't
say
he
shall
not
be
sentenced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
provision
of
the
constitution
that
you
couldn't
excuse
under
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
say
double
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
the
whole
argument
about
double
jeopardy
is
that
you
should
make
the
man
be
exposed
to
it
the
second
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
error
in
this
case
you
admit
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
the
trial
should
not
admit
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
despite
that
fact,
you
can
try
in
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood

his
right
was
not
to
be
twice
charged
with
the
same
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
he
was
put
to
trial
on
that,
is
it
not
true
that
the
constitution
was
violated
as
of
that
moment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
talking
about
harmless
error?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
the
prolonged
trial
with
the
possibility
he
can
be
electrocuted
is
not
a
right
that
entitled
to
the
full
protection
of
this
court,
just
the
right
not
to
be
charged
with
it,
certainly
not
to
be
tried
with
that
hanging
over
your
ear?
