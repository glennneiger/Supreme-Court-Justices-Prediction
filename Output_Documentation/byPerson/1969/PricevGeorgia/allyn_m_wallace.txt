mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
stand
here
in
this
place
where
many
great
men
have
stood
before
this
august
body
of
our
government,
i'm
reminded
of
an
incident
that
occurred
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
before
judge
douglas
in
my
early
years
in
the
practice
of
law.
in
addressing
that
body,
i
was
arguing
with
all
my
might
the
point
of
law
and
the
late
chief
justice
of
that
court
said
to
me,
mr.
wallace,
we
are
not
interested
in
hearing
your
version
of
the
law,
remember,
we
make
it
here,
we'd
rather
hear
something
about
the
facts.
with
that
thought
in
mind,
and
this
being
my
first
appearance
before
this
great
body
and
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
i
would
like
if
permissible
to
give
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
in
1962
in
october,
the
petitioner
in
certiorari
earl
price
was
indicted
in
effingham
county,
superior
--
georgia
superior
court
for
the
offense
of
murder.
the
following
day,
he
was
tried
in
that
court
for
murder
before
a
jury.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
is
now
deceased.
the
key
is
that
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
on
the
trial
of
murder
of
voluntary
manslaughter.
they
said
nothing
about
the
murder
charge
in
their
verdict.
the
verdict
merely
said,
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
fixed
his
punishment
from
10
to
15
years.
i
took
that
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
review
of
georgia.
it
was
reversed
on
an
erroneous
charge
of
the
late
judge
walton
usher.
in
1967
in
october,
the
same
man
was
called
upon
in
the
same
court,
under
the
same
indictment
for
the
same
offense
of
murder,
to
answer
and
to
plea
to
the
charge
of
murder.
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case,
second
time
in
1967,
i
filed
a
plea
in
the
court
of
former
jeopardy.
the
plea
was
argued
at
length
and
the
court
overruled
my
plea
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
case
went
to
trial,
the
second
time,
not
for
manslaughter
but
under
the
same
indictment,
grand
jury
indictment
for
the
same
offense
before
a
jury
and
before
the
same
trial
judge.
that
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
said
nothing
about
murder
or
voluntary
manslaughter
as
did
the
first
jury.
fixing
his
sentence
at
10
years
rather
than
10
to
15
years
as
the
first
jury
did.
the
usual
procedure
was
followed
and
the
case
was
again
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
georgia
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
i
believe
and
they
sent
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
it
went
back
by
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
we
are
now
in
this
court
for
an
opinion.
there's
two
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
if
your
honor
please,
the
appendix
will
show
that
no
reason
was
given
except
that
the
motion
was
denied
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct.
the
case
–-
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
certainly
did,
yes,
and
i
think
the
appendix
will
show
that
and
not
only
mr.
chief
justice
did
i
cite
the
green
case,
but
there
was
a
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
justice
marshall
wrote
that
opinion
when
he
was
on
that
bench.
i
may
not
pronounce
that
word
correctly
as
no
set
rule
for
pronouncing
proper
names
but
i
believe
its
hecknes,
is
that
correct?
henny?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
and
in
that
decision
that
justice
marshall
wrote
of
that
opinion,
he
used
the
green
case
and
i
used
both
of
these
cases
in
my
argument
in
the
trial
court.
now,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
under
georgia
law,
i
believe
that
is
correct
sir
and
that
was
what
i
insisted
that
a
new
indictment
be
brought.
now,
the
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
he
could,
yes,
that's
my
humble
opinion.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
felt
that
to
try
him
again
would
be
double
jeopardy.
they
were
trying
him
twice
for
something
that
the
first
jury,
the
second
time,
the
first
jury
had
acquitted
him.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir,
under
georgia
law,
yes
sir.
now,
when
this
jury
and
my
position
is
the
same
as
the
green
case
and
the
case
that
justice
marshall
rendered
his
opinion
on.
when
that
first
case,
jury
came
in
and
said
and
if
i
--
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
we
fix
his
punishment
at
--
from
10
to
15
years.
it
was
the
same
even
though
they
were
solid
on
the
murder
charge.
it
was
the
same
as
if
the
jury
had
come
in
and
said
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
murder
but
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter.
now,
my
humble
opponent
here
may
argue
the
point
that
he
got
a
lesser
sentence
at
the
second
trial
even
though
he
was
tried
for
murder
and
the
appendix
will
show
that
the
second
trial,
the
jury
was
given
the
charge
of
murder,
they
could
have
selected
either/or
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
of
either
murder
or
voluntary
manslaughter
as
they
so
fit.
but
(inaudible)
to
say
my
friend
here
on
my
right
will
probably
argue
that
this
was
a
lesser
sentence,
10
years
or
with
regard
to
10
to
15
years.
i'm
sure
that
my
friend
will
admit
that
under
the
rule
in
georgia,
our
pardon
and
parole
board
when
you
have
served
a
third
of
your
minimum
sentence,
you're
eligible
for
parole.
now,
i
take
the
position
that
there
was
no
less
sentence
in
the
second
trial
than
in
the
first
trial.
now,
as
i
stand
here
and
argue
this
question
which
was
presented
here
for
review,
i
feel
that
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
this
court
june
of
last
year
in
the
benton
versus
maryland
case.
i
came
here
on
a
proper
affidavit
of
certiorari.
we
have
asked
the
court
to
pass
on
these
questions
and
the
state
if
i
may
refer
to
their
brief,
has
admitted
that
my
questions
have
been
resolved,
thus
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
apply
and
if
so
under
the
facts
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
subjected
to
double
jeopardy.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
feel
that
the
injury
was
--
you
got
me
a
little
ahead
of
my
thought,
i
was
going
to
bring
that
out
but
if
you
give
me
just
a
second
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
feel
that
the
--
the
injury
is
that
if
the
jury
had
been
given
the
opportunity
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
rather
than
murder,
they
would
have
given
and
i
believe,
i
may
not
be
stating
that
as
it
was
said
in
the
case
of
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion
on
and
the
green
case
but
i
feel
that
they
would
have
considered
his
innocence,
probably
given
more
thought,
a
more
consideration
to
his
innocence
rather
than
to
--
considering
his
conviction
if
he
had
been
tried
for
manslaughter
because
he
was
tried
the
second
time
for
murder.
does
that
answer
your
question
as
to
my
position
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
the
court
under
this
statute
would
have
--
could
have
–
they
could
have
found
as
if
a
misdemeanor
and
given
him
possibly
a
sentence
of
one
year
maximum,
a
thousand
dollar
fine
plus
six
months
in
jail,
i
believe
that's
maximum
on
misdemeanor
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
but,
yes,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct
sir.
now,
when
the
appendix
came
up
and
was
printed,
this
was
a
pauper
case
and
i
was
--
i
paid
for
that
myself
out
of
my
pocket.
i
did
not
bring
the
whole
record
because
it
was
rather
expensive.
i
may
have
got
the
record
from
the
lower
appellate
court
covering
this
one
issue.
now,
as
i
said,
i
feel
like
that
the
benton
case
has
now
resolved
this
issue
and
when
i
read
the
benton
case
then
i
received
instructions
from
this
court
when
i
argued
this
case
to
argue
the
retroactivity
of
the
benton
case
in
connection
with
this
case.
now,
if
i
may,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
the
court
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
the
remaining
few
minutes
that
i
have
to
argue
that
point
after
the
attorney
general's
of
--
the
gentleman
from
the
attorney
general's
office
of
georgia
had
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
take
issue
was
that
like
to
me.
first
of
all,
i
take
issue
with
my
brother
about
the
pardoning
of
one
in
georgia.
at
the
time
price
was
tried
the
second
time,
that
was
not
the
rule.
the
pardon
board
as
it
now
stands,
parole
board
if
they
see
fit
can
grant
a
pardon
the
second
day
or
the
first
day
after
he
had
been
incarcerated,
if
i
understand
the
rule
correctly.
now,
i've
always
felt
that
the
law
had
two
basic
purposes.
one
was
to
protect
society,
and
the
other
was
to
correct
the
wrong
doing.
now,
justice
marshall,
i
believe
it
was
the
other
justice
that
asked
me
what
harm
had
been
done
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cichos
case
and
it
was
used
by
justice
marshall
in
the
case
of
a
second
circuit
of
appeals
which
was
the
case
out
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
court.
the
second
time
gave
the
prosecution
the
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice.
a
situation
which
is
out
to
induce
a
doubtful
jury
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
lesser
serious
offense
rather
than
to
continue
debate
as
to
his
innocence.
this
doctrine
was
also
stated
and
it
refers
to
chief
justice
marshall's
case.
now,
that's
my
position
in
this
matter
and
that's
where
i
say
the
error
or
the
harm
was
committed.
it's
as
the
court
brought
out
is
not
that
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
he
was
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
which
the
constitution
says
no,
and
if
it
says
anything
at
all,
that's
what
it
says.
and
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
i
understand
the
law
correctly
of
georgia,
the
remitted
duo
has
never
gone
down
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
to
the
trial
court
and
is
still
in
the
presence
of
supreme
court
of
georgia
opinion
the
outcome
of
this
case
here
in
this
honorable
body.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
now,
they
can
be
--
he
can
be
reindicted.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
he
can
be
reindicted
for
manslaughter.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
no
sir,
i
can't
see
that.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
don't
think
so,
no.
i
think
it
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
courts
with
anything
to
be
how
--
if
this
court
should
find
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
double
jeopardy,
but
not
inconsistent
with
that
decision.
now,
that's
my
position.
now,
that's
where
i
say
the
harm
has
been
done.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
if
i
may
go
outside
of
the
record
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
issue
came
up
in
the
argument
in
the
court
when
i
argued
the
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
that
the
solicitor
said
that
he
is
indicted
for
murder
and
that's
all
i
can
try
him
for.
now,
he
said
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
give
a
new
indictment
for
manslaughter
in
order
to
do
it
and
that's
when
the
judge
picked
up
his
gavel
and
said
motion
overruled.
now,
i
still
contend
that
he
can
be
retried
for
manslaughter
on
the
proper
indictment
and
the
statute
has
not
run.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
no,
no,
not
in
a
felony,
no
sir,
no
sir
cannot.
now,
in
misdemeanor
cases
you
can.
now
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
one
to
20
years
i
believe.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
10
to
15.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
last
time
10
sir,
the
first
time
10
to
15.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
trick
the
jury
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
jury
fixed
the
sentence.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
they
can
come
in
with
a
recommendation
if
it's
--
if
it's
up
without
recommendation
then
the
court
has
no
other
alternative
but
to
inflict
the
death
penalty.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
not
for
manslaughter
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
--
if
they
fix
it,
jury
fixes
it.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
jury
is
charged
from
black
years
to
black
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
what
makes
a
minimum
of
a
year,
maximum
of
10
years
--
20
years?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
one
to
10
to
15,
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that
10
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
think
you
do,
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
they
did
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
--
except
within
a
minimum
of
10
to
15
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
now,
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
my
good
friend
here
has
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
brantley
case
and
i've
set
this
out
in
my
brief
and
i'm
sure
this
honorable
body
has
read
that
brief.
that
was
a
1910
decision.
the
feet
have
been
cut
out
from
under
that
case.
not
only
that
case
but
other
cases
have
been
set
aside,
the
poker
doctrine
has
gone.
the
twining
doctrine
case
is
gone.
the
5202
case,
all
of
those
decisions
of
this
honorable
body
have
been
cut
away.
we
are
living
in
the
year
of
1970,
not
1910.
there
has
been
many
decisions
recently
in
this
court
that
have
been
or
have
upturn,
overturned
at
least
all
the
established
rules
and
principles
that
have
long
since
been
gone
and
i
cannot
go
along
with
my
brother
on
this
good
--
on
this
brantley
case
which
said,
if
a
man
voluntarily
seeks
a
new
trial
and
obtains
it,
then
he
is
barred
from
pleading
double
jeopardy,
that's
not
the
law
now.
now,
if
the
benton
case
means
anything,
it
means
that
it
would
be
unfair
certainly
discriminatory
to
give
new
trials
for
unconstitutional
convictions
when
others
are
kept
in
prison
without
any
hope
or
any
reward
whatsoever,
simply
because
it
would
cost
the
state
maybe
a
little
money
or
a
little
effort
to
retry
this
on
individual.
later,
it
is
best
to
show
up
and
sweep,
i
don't
care
if
it's
a
man
or
beast
and
to
incarcerate
a
man
in
jail
and
not
give
him
the
privilege
of
what
you've
given
someone
else
would
certainly
be
in
my
opinion
unjust
and
certainly
a
rape
of
justice
if
i
may
use
that
phrase.
now,
as
i've
said
in
my
brief,
i'm
not
too
concerned
about
it.
i
think
the
brantley
and
the
benton
case
said
to
know,
you
have
violated
the
law,
you
have
gone
beyond
you
bounds
in
convicting
this
man
or
placing
him
in
jeopardy
twice
now
corrected.
if
the
green
and
the
case
from
the
second
court
of
appeals
means
anything
at
all,
it
means
that
all
of
the
states,
if
you
have
violated
the
law
and
you
haven't
given
a
man
his
constitutional
rights,
or
he's
been
denied
that
right,
then
i
think
then
benton
case
says
retry
him
regardless
of
what
the
consequences
are
and
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
justice
black,
i
feel
that
had
he
not
been
tried
for
murder
the
second
time
as
was
i
believe
you
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cichos
case
and
this
is
your
language
sir.
“by
trying
petitioner
the
second
time
for
murder,
“now,
mr.
justice
marshall
adopted
that
in
his
decision,
“by
trying
petitioner
the
second
time
for
murder,
it
gave
the
prosecution,
the
state
an
unfair
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice,
a
situation
that
was
apt
to
induce
a
doubtful
jury
to
find
the
petitioner
guilty
of
a
less
offense
rather
than
find
him
not
guilty
or
acquittal
or
to
even
to
continue
their
deliberations
or
debate
as
to
his
innocence.”
now,
my
position
is
if
this
man
had
not
been
tried
for
murder,
i
feel
that
this
jury,
this
is
a
small
county,
its
population
is
about
15000.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
effingham
county
springfield
georgia,
and
i
feel
that
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
its
about
30
miles
out
of
savannah,
on
highway
21.
and
i
feel
that
had
this
man
been
tried
for
manslaughter,
the
jury
would
have
been
more
inclined
and
probably
considered
longer
his
innocence
rather
than
to
find
him
guilty
of
some
lesser
offense
than
murder
when
he
was
tried
for
murder
the
second
time.
now,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes,
it
might
even
acquitted
him
and
this
case
is
--
well,
i
can't
go
outside
and
recommend.
but
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
that's
true
and
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
i
personally
paid
for
that
record,
i'm
without
pearce.
i
put
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
in
this
case.
i'm
thoroughly
convinced
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
another
trial
on
voluntary
manslaughter
and
as
i've
said
a
moment
ago,
the
trial
judge
in
now
deceased,
that
tried
both
cases.
the
solicitor
general
has
retired
from
office
and
i
have
some
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
case
even
though
you
referred
back
as
i
suggested
will
never
be
tried
again,
and
now
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
for
the
last
closing
moments
refer
to
the
ashe
case
versus
swenson,
the
warden
and
also
waller
versus
florida
case.
and
the
court
said
and
that
was
on
april
of
this
year
that
these
two
decisions
came
down,
this
is
not
last
year,
as
five
years
ago
or
back
on
in
1910
and
this
is
very
plain.
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
court's
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
that's
ahead
new.
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
395
us
711
decided
the
same
day
as
benton,
the
court
unanimously
--
unanimously
the
court
had
(fully
retroactivity)
effect
of
the
benton
doctrine.
and
they
went
on
and
said
that
any
case
as
i
interpret
in
the
waller
case
that
any
case
that
might
come
before
this
honorable
body
that
might
arise
or
fall
in
the
end
it
--
of
the
ashe
case
and
the
waller
case,
that
is
within
the
bounds
or
any
limits
for
this
one
issue
are
then
these
two
cases
would
apply.
had
no
worn
again
the
waller
case
had
and
this
was
justice
brennan
if
i
believe
i'm
not
supposed
to
refer
specifically
to
a
justice
but
if
justice
brennan
will
pardon
me.
i
adhere
to
the
courts
ruling
in
ashe
versus
swenson
that
our
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland
holding
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
in
“fully
retroactive.”
and
they
again
referred
to
the
north
carolina
versus
pearce
395,
i
think
that
is
a
crux
of
my
case.
i
think
the
benton
case
is
retroactive
in
any
case
it
might
fall
within
its
bounds
and
within
the
ambit
of
that
case
and
i
say
that
this
price
case
is
one
of
those
cases,
and
i'm
asking
this
court
in
all
fairness
to
give
this
man
the
opportunity
and
as
i've
said
i
doubt
and
i
have
very
serious
doubt
that
this
man
will
ever
be
tried
again.
i
think
even
--
so
wind
it
up
because
as
i
said
i
can't
bring
out
anything
outside
the
record,
it
was
unfortunate
that
i
couldn't
bring
a
whole
record
because
it
was
expensive
and
i've
spent
enough
time
and
effort,
this
is
my
second
day
in
washington
on
this
case
without
pearce,
that's
how
interested
i'm
in
this
case
and
this
man
getting
what
i
think
is
justice.
i
never
take
a
case
although
like
pearce
and
that's
why
i'm
here
and
i'm
asking
this
honorable
body
to
please
consider
my
brief
and
what
i
have
said
here
today,
and
grant
this
man
another
opportunity
because
he
is
entitled
to
it
as
i
see
though
and
i
thank
you
all
so
much
for
listening
to
me
and
it
had
been
a
privilege
to
be
have
been
here,
this
be
my
first
time.
thank
you.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
stand
here
in
this
place
where
many
great
men
have
stood
before
this
august
body
of
our
government,
i'm
reminded
of
an
incident
that
occurred
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
before
judge
douglas
in
my
early
years
in
the
practice
of
law.
in
addressing
that
body,
i
was
arguing
with
all
my
might
the
point
of
law
and
the
late
chief
justice
of
that
court
said
to
me,
mr.
wallace,
we
are
not
interested
in
hearing
your
version
of
the
law,
remember,
we
make
it
here,
we'd
rather
hear
something
about
the
facts.
with
that
thought
in
mind,
and
this
being
my
first
appearance
before
this
great
body
and
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
i
would
like
if
permissible
to
give
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
just
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
in
1962
in
october,
the
petitioner
in
certiorari
earl
price
was
indicted
in
effingham
county,
superior
--
georgia
superior
court
for
the
offense
of
murder.
the
following
day,
he
was
tried
in
that
court
for
murder
before
a
jury.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
is
now
deceased.
the
key
is
that
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
on
the
trial
of
murder
of
voluntary
manslaughter.
they
said
nothing
about
the
murder
charge
in
their
verdict.
the
verdict
merely
said,
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
fixed
his
punishment
from
10
to
15
years.
i
took
that
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
review
of
georgia.
it
was
reversed
on
an
erroneous
charge
of
the
late
judge
walton
usher.
in
1967
in
october,
the
same
man
was
called
upon
in
the
same
court,
under
the
same
indictment
for
the
same
offense
of
murder,
to
answer
and
to
plea
to
the
charge
of
murder.
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case,
second
time
in
1967,
i
filed
a
plea
in
the
court
of
former
jeopardy.
the
plea
was
argued
at
length
and
the
court
overruled
my
plea
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
case
went
to
trial,
the
second
time,
not
for
manslaughter
but
under
the
same
indictment,
grand
jury
indictment
for
the
same
offense
before
a
jury
and
before
the
same
trial
judge.
that
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
said
nothing
about
murder
or
voluntary
manslaughter
as
did
the
first
jury.
fixing
his
sentence
at
10
years
rather
than
10
to
15
years
as
the
first
jury
did.
the
usual
procedure
was
followed
and
the
case
was
again
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
georgia
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
i
believe
and
they
sent
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
it
went
back
by
a
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
we
are
now
in
this
court
for
an
opinion.
there's
two
constitutional
questions
that
we
raised
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
if
your
honor
please,
the
appendix
will
show
that
no
reason
was
given
except
that
the
motion
was
denied
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct.
the
case
–-
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
certainly
did,
yes,
and
i
think
the
appendix
will
show
that
and
not
only
mr.
chief
justice
did
i
cite
the
green
case,
but
there
was
a
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
justice
marshall
wrote
that
opinion
when
he
was
on
that
bench.
i
may
not
pronounce
that
word
correctly
as
no
set
rule
for
pronouncing
proper
names
but
i
believe
its
hecknes,
is
that
correct?
henny?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
and
in
that
decision
that
justice
marshall
wrote
of
that
opinion,
he
used
the
green
case
and
i
used
both
of
these
cases
in
my
argument
in
the
trial
court.
now,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
under
georgia
law,
i
believe
that
is
correct
sir
and
that
was
what
i
insisted
that
a
new
indictment
be
brought.
now,
the
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
he
could,
yes,
that's
my
humble
opinion.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
felt
that
to
try
him
again
would
be
double
jeopardy.
they
were
trying
him
twice
for
something
that
the
first
jury,
the
second
time,
the
first
jury
had
acquitted
him.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir,
under
georgia
law,
yes
sir.
now,
when
this
jury
and
my
position
is
the
same
as
the
green
case
and
the
case
that
justice
marshall
rendered
his
opinion
on.
when
that
first
case,
jury
came
in
and
said
and
if
i
--
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
we
fix
his
punishment
at
--
from
10
to
15
years.
it
was
the
same
even
though
they
were
solid
on
the
murder
charge.
it
was
the
same
as
if
the
jury
had
come
in
and
said
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
of
murder
but
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter.
now,
my
humble
opponent
here
may
argue
the
point
that
he
got
a
lesser
sentence
at
the
second
trial
even
though
he
was
tried
for
murder
and
the
appendix
will
show
that
the
second
trial,
the
jury
was
given
the
charge
of
murder,
they
could
have
selected
either/or
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
of
either
murder
or
voluntary
manslaughter
as
they
so
fit.
but
(inaudible)
to
say
my
friend
here
on
my
right
will
probably
argue
that
this
was
a
lesser
sentence,
10
years
or
with
regard
to
10
to
15
years.
i'm
sure
that
my
friend
will
admit
that
under
the
rule
in
georgia,
our
pardon
and
parole
board
when
you
have
served
a
third
of
your
minimum
sentence,
you're
eligible
for
parole.
now,
i
take
the
position
that
there
was
no
less
sentence
in
the
second
trial
than
in
the
first
trial.
now,
as
i
stand
here
and
argue
this
question
which
was
presented
here
for
review,
i
feel
that
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
this
court
june
of
last
year
in
the
benton
versus
maryland
case.
i
came
here
on
a
proper
affidavit
of
certiorari.
we
have
asked
the
court
to
pass
on
these
questions
and
the
state
if
i
may
refer
to
their
brief,
has
admitted
that
my
questions
have
been
resolved,
thus
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
apply
and
if
so
under
the
facts
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
subjected
to
double
jeopardy.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
feel
that
the
injury
was
--
you
got
me
a
little
ahead
of
my
thought,
i
was
going
to
bring
that
out
but
if
you
give
me
just
a
second
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
feel
that
the
--
the
injury
is
that
if
the
jury
had
been
given
the
opportunity
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
rather
than
murder,
they
would
have
given
and
i
believe,
i
may
not
be
stating
that
as
it
was
said
in
the
case
of
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion
on
and
the
green
case
but
i
feel
that
they
would
have
considered
his
innocence,
probably
given
more
thought,
a
more
consideration
to
his
innocence
rather
than
to
--
considering
his
conviction
if
he
had
been
tried
for
manslaughter
because
he
was
tried
the
second
time
for
murder.
does
that
answer
your
question
as
to
my
position
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
believe
the
court
under
this
statute
would
have
--
could
have
–
they
could
have
found
as
if
a
misdemeanor
and
given
him
possibly
a
sentence
of
one
year
maximum,
a
thousand
dollar
fine
plus
six
months
in
jail,
i
believe
that's
maximum
on
misdemeanor
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
but,
yes,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
correct
sir.
now,
when
the
appendix
came
up
and
was
printed,
this
was
a
pauper
case
and
i
was
--
i
paid
for
that
myself
out
of
my
pocket.
i
did
not
bring
the
whole
record
because
it
was
rather
expensive.
i
may
have
got
the
record
from
the
lower
appellate
court
covering
this
one
issue.
now,
as
i
said,
i
feel
like
that
the
benton
case
has
now
resolved
this
issue
and
when
i
read
the
benton
case
then
i
received
instructions
from
this
court
when
i
argued
this
case
to
argue
the
retroactivity
of
the
benton
case
in
connection
with
this
case.
now,
if
i
may,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
the
court
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
the
remaining
few
minutes
that
i
have
to
argue
that
point
after
the
attorney
general's
of
--
the
gentleman
from
the
attorney
general's
office
of
georgia
had
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
thank
you
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
take
issue
was
that
like
to
me.
first
of
all,
i
take
issue
with
my
brother
about
the
pardoning
of
one
in
georgia.
at
the
time
price
was
tried
the
second
time,
that
was
not
the
rule.
the
pardon
board
as
it
now
stands,
parole
board
if
they
see
fit
can
grant
a
pardon
the
second
day
or
the
first
day
after
he
had
been
incarcerated,
if
i
understand
the
rule
correctly.
now,
i've
always
felt
that
the
law
had
two
basic
purposes.
one
was
to
protect
society,
and
the
other
was
to
correct
the
wrong
doing.
now,
justice
marshall,
i
believe
it
was
the
other
justice
that
asked
me
what
harm
had
been
done
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cichos
case
and
it
was
used
by
justice
marshall
in
the
case
of
a
second
circuit
of
appeals
which
was
the
case
out
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
court.
the
second
time
gave
the
prosecution
the
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice.
a
situation
which
is
out
to
induce
a
doubtful
jury
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
lesser
serious
offense
rather
than
to
continue
debate
as
to
his
innocence.
this
doctrine
was
also
stated
and
it
refers
to
chief
justice
marshall's
case.
now,
that's
my
position
in
this
matter
and
that's
where
i
say
the
error
or
the
harm
was
committed.
it's
as
the
court
brought
out
is
not
that
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
he
was
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
which
the
constitution
says
no,
and
if
it
says
anything
at
all,
that's
what
it
says.
and
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
i
understand
the
law
correctly
of
georgia,
the
remitted
duo
has
never
gone
down
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
to
the
trial
court
and
is
still
in
the
presence
of
supreme
court
of
georgia
opinion
the
outcome
of
this
case
here
in
this
honorable
body.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
now,
they
can
be
--
he
can
be
reindicted.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
he
can
be
reindicted
for
manslaughter.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
no
sir,
i
can't
see
that.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
don't
think
so,
no.
i
think
it
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
courts
with
anything
to
be
how
--
if
this
court
should
find
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
double
jeopardy,
but
not
inconsistent
with
that
decision.
now,
that's
my
position.
now,
that's
where
i
say
the
harm
has
been
done.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
if
i
may
go
outside
of
the
record
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
issue
came
up
in
the
argument
in
the
court
when
i
argued
the
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
that
the
solicitor
said
that
he
is
indicted
for
murder
and
that's
all
i
can
try
him
for.
now,
he
said
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
give
a
new
indictment
for
manslaughter
in
order
to
do
it
and
that's
when
the
judge
picked
up
his
gavel
and
said
motion
overruled.
now,
i
still
contend
that
he
can
be
retried
for
manslaughter
on
the
proper
indictment
and
the
statute
has
not
run.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
no,
no,
not
in
a
felony,
no
sir,
no
sir
cannot.
now,
in
misdemeanor
cases
you
can.
now
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
one
to
20
years
i
believe.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
10
to
15.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
last
time
10
sir,
the
first
time
10
to
15.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
trick
the
jury
at
that
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
jury
fixed
the
sentence.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
they
can
come
in
with
a
recommendation
if
it's
--
if
it's
up
without
recommendation
then
the
court
has
no
other
alternative
but
to
inflict
the
death
penalty.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
not
for
manslaughter
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
--
if
they
fix
it,
jury
fixes
it.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
the
jury
is
charged
from
black
years
to
black
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
what
makes
a
minimum
of
a
year,
maximum
of
10
years
--
20
years?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
one
to
10
to
15,
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that
10
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
i
think
you
do,
yes.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
they
did
sir.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
that's
--
except
within
a
minimum
of
10
to
15
years.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
now,
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
my
good
friend
here
has
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
brantley
case
and
i've
set
this
out
in
my
brief
and
i'm
sure
this
honorable
body
has
read
that
brief.
that
was
a
1910
decision.
the
feet
have
been
cut
out
from
under
that
case.
not
only
that
case
but
other
cases
have
been
set
aside,
the
poker
doctrine
has
gone.
the
twining
doctrine
case
is
gone.
the
5202
case,
all
of
those
decisions
of
this
honorable
body
have
been
cut
away.
we
are
living
in
the
year
of
1970,
not
1910.
there
has
been
many
decisions
recently
in
this
court
that
have
been
or
have
upturn,
overturned
at
least
all
the
established
rules
and
principles
that
have
long
since
been
gone
and
i
cannot
go
along
with
my
brother
on
this
good
--
on
this
brantley
case
which
said,
if
a
man
voluntarily
seeks
a
new
trial
and
obtains
it,
then
he
is
barred
from
pleading
double
jeopardy,
that's
not
the
law
now.
now,
if
the
benton
case
means
anything,
it
means
that
it
would
be
unfair
certainly
discriminatory
to
give
new
trials
for
unconstitutional
convictions
when
others
are
kept
in
prison
without
any
hope
or
any
reward
whatsoever,
simply
because
it
would
cost
the
state
maybe
a
little
money
or
a
little
effort
to
retry
this
on
individual.
later,
it
is
best
to
show
up
and
sweep,
i
don't
care
if
it's
a
man
or
beast
and
to
incarcerate
a
man
in
jail
and
not
give
him
the
privilege
of
what
you've
given
someone
else
would
certainly
be
in
my
opinion
unjust
and
certainly
a
rape
of
justice
if
i
may
use
that
phrase.
now,
as
i've
said
in
my
brief,
i'm
not
too
concerned
about
it.
i
think
the
brantley
and
the
benton
case
said
to
know,
you
have
violated
the
law,
you
have
gone
beyond
you
bounds
in
convicting
this
man
or
placing
him
in
jeopardy
twice
now
corrected.
if
the
green
and
the
case
from
the
second
court
of
appeals
means
anything
at
all,
it
means
that
all
of
the
states,
if
you
have
violated
the
law
and
you
haven't
given
a
man
his
constitutional
rights,
or
he's
been
denied
that
right,
then
i
think
then
benton
case
says
retry
him
regardless
of
what
the
consequences
are
and
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
sir?
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
mr.
justice
black,
i
feel
that
had
he
not
been
tried
for
murder
the
second
time
as
was
i
believe
you
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
cichos
case
and
this
is
your
language
sir.
“by
trying
petitioner
the
second
time
for
murder,
“now,
mr.
justice
marshall
adopted
that
in
his
decision,
“by
trying
petitioner
the
second
time
for
murder,
it
gave
the
prosecution,
the
state
an
unfair
advantage
of
offering
the
jury
a
choice,
a
situation
that
was
apt
to
induce
a
doubtful
jury
to
find
the
petitioner
guilty
of
a
less
offense
rather
than
find
him
not
guilty
or
acquittal
or
to
even
to
continue
their
deliberations
or
debate
as
to
his
innocence.”
now,
my
position
is
if
this
man
had
not
been
tried
for
murder,
i
feel
that
this
jury,
this
is
a
small
county,
its
population
is
about
15000.
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
effingham
county
springfield
georgia,
and
i
feel
that
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
its
about
30
miles
out
of
savannah,
on
highway
21.
and
i
feel
that
had
this
man
been
tried
for
manslaughter,
the
jury
would
have
been
more
inclined
and
probably
considered
longer
his
innocence
rather
than
to
find
him
guilty
of
some
lesser
offense
than
murder
when
he
was
tried
for
murder
the
second
time.
now,
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
yes,
it
might
even
acquitted
him
and
this
case
is
--
well,
i
can't
go
outside
and
recommend.
but
--
mr.
allyn
m.
wallace
well,
that's
true
and
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
i
personally
paid
for
that
record,
i'm
without
pearce.
i
put
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
in
this
case.
i'm
thoroughly
convinced
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
another
trial
on
voluntary
manslaughter
and
as
i've
said
a
moment
ago,
the
trial
judge
in
now
deceased,
that
tried
both
cases.
the
solicitor
general
has
retired
from
office
and
i
have
some
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
case
even
though
you
referred
back
as
i
suggested
will
never
be
tried
again,
and
now
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
for
the
last
closing
moments
refer
to
the
ashe
case
versus
swenson,
the
warden
and
also
waller
versus
florida
case.
and
the
court
said
and
that
was
on
april
of
this
year
that
these
two
decisions
came
down,
this
is
not
last
year,
as
five
years
ago
or
back
on
in
1910
and
this
is
very
plain.
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
court's
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
that's
ahead
new.
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
395
us
711
decided
the
same
day
as
benton,
the
court
unanimously
--
unanimously
the
court
had
(fully
retroactivity)
effect
of
the
benton
doctrine.
and
they
went
on
and
said
that
any
case
as
i
interpret
in
the
waller
case
that
any
case
that
might
come
before
this
honorable
body
that
might
arise
or
fall
in
the
end
it
--
of
the
ashe
case
and
the
waller
case,
that
is
within
the
bounds
or
any
limits
for
this
one
issue
are
then
these
two
cases
would
apply.
had
no
worn
again
the
waller
case
had
and
this
was
justice
brennan
if
i
believe
i'm
not
supposed
to
refer
specifically
to
a
justice
but
if
justice
brennan
will
pardon
me.
i
adhere
to
the
courts
ruling
in
ashe
versus
swenson
that
our
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland
holding
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
in
“fully
retroactive.”
and
they
again
referred
to
the
north
carolina
versus
pearce
395,
i
think
that
is
a
crux
of
my
case.
i
think
the
benton
case
is
retroactive
in
any
case
it
might
fall
within
its
bounds
and
within
the
ambit
of
that
case
and
i
say
that
this
price
case
is
one
of
those
cases,
and
i'm
asking
this
court
in
all
fairness
to
give
this
man
the
opportunity
and
as
i've
said
i
doubt
and
i
have
very
serious
doubt
that
this
man
will
ever
be
tried
again.
i
think
even
--
so
wind
it
up
because
as
i
said
i
can't
bring
out
anything
outside
the
record,
it
was
unfortunate
that
i
couldn't
bring
a
whole
record
because
it
was
expensive
and
i've
spent
enough
time
and
effort,
this
is
my
second
day
in
washington
on
this
case
without
pearce,
that's
how
interested
i'm
in
this
case
and
this
man
getting
what
i
think
is
justice.
i
never
take
a
case
although
like
pearce
and
that's
why
i'm
here
and
i'm
asking
this
honorable
body
to
please
consider
my
brief
and
what
i
have
said
here
today,
and
grant
this
man
another
opportunity
because
he
is
entitled
to
it
as
i
see
though
and
i
thank
you
all
so
much
for
listening
to
me
and
it
had
been
a
privilege
to
be
have
been
here,
this
be
my
first
time.
thank
you.
