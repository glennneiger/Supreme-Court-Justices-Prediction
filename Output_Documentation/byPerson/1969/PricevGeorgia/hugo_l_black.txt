justice
hugo
l.
black
could
i
ask
you
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
court
again
for
overruling
your
motion
for
being
barred
which
took
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
--
what
is
the
injury
your
man
has
suffered
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
wait
--
just
wait?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
you
probably
answered
to
my
brother's
ability
can
be
answered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
not
only
say
is
not
a
good
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
reindicted
him,
there
wouldn't
be
any
double
jeopardy
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
asking
you
now,
supposing
you
lose
this
case,
can
you
reindict
him
now
for
manslaughter
and
try
him
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
--
that's
what
i
asked
you.
mr.
wallace,
with
statute
limitations
around.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
essence
of
your
--
and
that's
the
essence
of
your
--
of
your
harmless
error
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
try
him
again
now
even
though
he
has
been
put
in
jeopardy
as
justice
marshall
says
you
can
try
him
again
for
the
manslaughter
charge
and
give
him
a
sentence.
now,
if
he's
convicted
not
longer
than
the
original
sentence,
isn't
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
harmless
error
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
your
harmless
error
claim
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
tell
me
whether
the
--
whether
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--statute
is
run?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
your
witnesses
still
available?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
wish
you'd
let
the
court
know
whether
the
statute
is
run
on
this
manslaughter
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
two
cases
you
said
where
you
had
--
why
since
green
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
does
not
apply
to
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
barktus
case,
there
was
a
--
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
of
the
usc
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
spell
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
aren't
there
quite
a
few
states
that
have
either
by
statute
or
a
court
decision
said
that
where
you
find
a
guilty
plea
of
a
lesser
offense
is
actually
an
acquittal
of
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
majority
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
georgia
could
have
done
it
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
to
understand
that
benton
was
argued
to
the
court
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
benton
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
brantley?
that's
right,
that's
right.
you're
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
talk
of
the
term
the
congress
there,
let
me
put
in
terms
of
remedies.
supposing
you
win,
what
our
--
what
should
be
the
consequence,
could
the
state
be
(inaudible)
after
knowing
that
charging
only
manslaughter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
should
our
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
our
mandate
prevented
him
from
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
shouldn't
do
that
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
wallace.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
laws
of
georgia,
can
you
proceed
by
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than
indictment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
minimum
sentence
for
manslaughter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
got
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
last
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
commit
them
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
have
state
again
what
you
considered
to
be
harm
that
he
has
suffered
being
tried
on
this
indictment
instead
of
one
simply
for
manslaughter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
counties
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
is
it,
below
savannah?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
substance
you
were
saying
and
where
there
was
a
top
match
to
which
present
can
be
affirmed,
those
on
then
that
a
jury
might
have
some
inclinations
to
compromise
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
doesn't
show
us
much
about
what
kind
of
case
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
i
ask
you
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
court
again
for
overruling
your
motion
for
being
barred
which
took
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
--
what
is
the
injury
your
man
has
suffered
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
wait
--
just
wait?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
you
probably
answered
to
my
brother's
ability
can
be
answered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
not
only
say
is
not
a
good
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
reindicted
him,
there
wouldn't
be
any
double
jeopardy
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
asking
you
now,
supposing
you
lose
this
case,
can
you
reindict
him
now
for
manslaughter
and
try
him
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
--
that's
what
i
asked
you.
mr.
wallace,
with
statute
limitations
around.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
essence
of
your
--
and
that's
the
essence
of
your
--
of
your
harmless
error
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
try
him
again
now
even
though
he
has
been
put
in
jeopardy
as
justice
marshall
says
you
can
try
him
again
for
the
manslaughter
charge
and
give
him
a
sentence.
now,
if
he's
convicted
not
longer
than
the
original
sentence,
isn't
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
harmless
error
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
your
harmless
error
claim
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
tell
me
whether
the
--
whether
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--statute
is
run?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
your
witnesses
still
available?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
wish
you'd
let
the
court
know
whether
the
statute
is
run
on
this
manslaughter
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
two

you
said
where
you
