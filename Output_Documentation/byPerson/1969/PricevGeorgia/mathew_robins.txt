mr.
mathew
robins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
rise
now
to
respond
to
one
of
the
two
directors
of
this
court
wherein
this
court
asked
to
show
why
benton
versus
maryland
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
respond
to
that
firstly.
i
would
say
as
reluctantly
as
it
is
as
i
can
that
benton
versus
maryland
is
applicable
to
this
case
but
not
so
much
because
of
what
benton
versus
maryland
says,
but
because
it
made
green
applicable
to
this
case
and
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
which
was
a
federal
principle
prior
to
benton
versus
maryland.
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
escape
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
for
green.
i'm
particularly
persuaded
to
this
decision
by
the
fact
that
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
ashe
versus
swenson
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
phrase,
run
the
gauntlet
in
green
meant
as
to
that
charge.
now,
i'm
afraid
that
in
this
case
that
is
perhaps
what
has
happened
to
mr.
price.
he
has
run
the
gauntlet
on
the
murder
charge.
mr.
mathew
robins
i'm
going
to
say
--
i
am
suggest
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
i'm
suggesting
that
because
in
the
state
of
georgia,
of
course,
they
do
not
come
back
and
say
that
he
is
acquitted
of
murder
and
he
is
found
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
as
were
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
in
the
state
of
georgia,
they
can
return
a
verdict
for
manslaughter
and
it
maybe
because
and
this
suggests
conjecture
but
it
maybe
because
the
crime
does
not
warrant
the
punishment
which
murder
would
require,
that
is
death
or
life
imprisonment,
that
is
required
by
statute.
it
maybe
that
the
facts
as
presented
to
the
jury
or
such
that
they
may
feel
that
this
doesn't
warrant
that
kind
of
punishment
and
yet
there
is
sufficient
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
voluntary
manslaughter
conviction.
i
might
add
also
that
in
the
state
of
georgia,
a
jury
may
bring
back
a
conviction
for
a
lesser
crime
even
though
they
were
not
charged
on
that
lesser
crime
where
the
evidence
warrants
it.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
they
were
in
this
particular
case
but
i
emphasize
the
point
that
there
is
discretion.
mr.
mathew
robins
in
this
case?
voluntary
manslaughter
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
robins
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
to
my
knowledge
that
is
all.
the
only
other
lesser
crime
as
such
would
be
involuntary
manslaughter.
now,
the
judge
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
jury
may
reduce
the
punishment
to
that
as
for
a
misdemeanor
where
the
jury
recommends
it
on
voluntary
manslaughter
and
involuntary
manslaughter
but
not
for
murder.
the
jury
is
compelled
on
a
murder
charge
to
either
recommend
mercy
or
in
their
absence
it
would
be
a
death
sentence?
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
it's
a
strange
relationship,
if
your
honor
please.
in
the
death
--
in
the
murder
situation,
they
indirectly
fix
the
sentence.
if
they
do
not
bring
back
a
recommendation
of
mercy,
the
sentence
is
automatically
death.
if
they
bring
back
a
recommendation
of
mercy,
it
is
automatically
life.
in
the
other
situations
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
involuntary
manslaughter,
they
may
fix
the
punishment.
they
may
recommend
a
punishment
i
believe
within
the
prescribed
range.
i
am
not
--
i
cannot
state
with
all
certainty
whether
the
judge
is
obligated
to
follow
that
recommendation
of
the
jury.
in
this
particular
case,
the
punishment
for
voluntary
manslaughter
is
1:20.
they
fix
punishment
at
10
to
15
initially
and
at
subsequently
at
10.
this
brings
to
mind
a
very
important
point
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this.
it
is
my
contention
as
my
brother
said
out
to
the
court
that
i
would
urge
this
court
to
find
that
this
man
has
not
been
harmed.
i
recognized
the
harmful
error
as
a
proposition
that
states
perhaps
overemphasized
the
fact
that
there
is
not
harmful
error.
i
say
here
there
was
no
harmful
error.
this
man
was
initially
sentenced
to
10
to
15
and
under
the
old
law
of
georgia
that
would
have
meant
that
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
a
conditional
release
which
is
tantamount
to
a
parole
at
the
end
of
10
years.
in
1964,
the
georgia
general
assembly
changed
the
law
and
required
that
sentences
be
made
definite
and
subsequently
the
--
and
a
second
trial,
mr.
price
was
sentenced
to
10
years.
this
meant
that
he
could
get
out
at
the
end
of
five
years
and
nine
months
assuming
all
good
behavior,
time
off
for
good
behavior.
so
he
has
received
a
material
benefit
by
the
act
of
the
general
assembly,
but
more
importantly,
he
has
not
been
harmed
in
what
has
happened
i
would
submit.
if
the
court
is
going
to
consider
the
hetenyi
proposition
then
it
is
considering
that
perhaps
the
jury
could
not
or
would
not
do
its
duty.
that
it
would
not
follow
the
directions
of
the
court.
in
this
particular
situation,
the
jury
rejected
the
charge
of
the
court
as
to
murder
and
brought
back
the
lesser
charge.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
did
do
their
duty
and
it
would
only
be
conjecture
that
that
they
might
have
done
something
else
had
they
not
been
--
had
there
not
been
evidence
on
murder.
mr.
mathew
robins
with
that
trial
today,
yes
sir.
of
course
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
that
is
my
point
in
so
far
as
applicability
of
the
benton
and
the
green
rule
made
that
comes
under
that.
i'm
persuaded
to
this
argument
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
this
is
quite
a
bit
different.
in
fact,
this
case
factually
is
different
than
any
other
case
that
i
can
find
in
the
records
of
this
court
with
the
possible
exception
of
cichos
versus
indiana
where
factually,
there
was
a
similar
situation
and
this
court
chose
not
to
pass
upon
it.
however,
getting
ahead
of
myself
however,
in
the
cichos
case
in
what
i
understood
to
be
just
dictum
it
did
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
proposition
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
but
factually,
this
case
is
different
and
because
of
the
facts
it
takes
it
out
from
benton,
takes
it
out
from
green
and
makes
it
a
new
case.
i
don't
believe
this
is
--
we
can
say
green
is
completely
applicable
because
there
that
man
came
back
with
a
death
sentence,
the
second
time,
yeah.
this
case,
this
man
has
come
back
with
something
even
less
than
he
got
the
first
time
in
so
far
as
time
to
be
served
in
prison.
mr.
mathew
robins
sir,
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
serve
anytime
after
--
mr.
mathew
robins
none
at
all
to
my
understanding.
mr.
mathew
robins
he
is
serving
now
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
but
he
did
not
serve
anytime
after
the
first
sentence.
however,
georgia
law
does
provide
that
where
one
remains
incarcerated
in
jail
during
an
appeal
they
will
reserve,
will
receive
benefit
for
that
time.
so
he
would
have
received
benefit
had
he
been
incarcerated.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
that
i
believe
i
would
have
to
admit
that
to
the
court.
i've
studied
the
cases.
i've
strained
for
some
distinguishing
characteristic
but
i
cannot
find
a
distinguishing
characteristic
and
as
i
stated
earlier,
i'm
also
--
persuaded
that
conclusion
by
your
honor's
dissent
in
ashe
versus
swenson
which
makes
reference
to
running
the
gauntlet
on
that
charge
and
if
we
apply
that
rationale
to
this
case,
mr.
price
ran
the
gauntlet
on
the
charge
of
murder
though
he
was
convicted
of
a
lesser
crime.
also,
i
must
recognize
that
in
us
versus
ball
that
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
not
determined
upon
the
punishment
that
it
receives
but
by
the
fact
whether
he
has
in
fact
been
tried
for
that
crime.
so,
it's
difficult
for
me
at
all
to
escape
this
but
not
withstanding
this
and
even
admitting
if
this
whould
be
an
admission
that
double
jeopardy
was
a
factor.
i'm
saying
there
are
other
elements
which
take
this
out
and
make
this
--
makes
this
harmless
error
instead
of
harmful
error,
and
of
course
the
chapman
versus
the
california
case
is
the
best
case
on
harmless
error
and
it
applied
in
that
case
a
test
in
faihey
versus
connecticut
which
said
that
where
there
is
reasonable
possibility
that
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
price
case,
the
jury
rejected
that
evidence
of
murder.
it
rejected
the
charge
of
the
court
and
in
essence
it
says
we
reject
any
evidence
on
murder.
we
find
that
it
is
not
an
applicable
situation
without
finding
innocence
or
quilt.
we're
saying
this
is
more
applicable,
voluntary
manslaughter.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
believe
your
honor
that
this
court
could
take
it
under
consideration
in
the
--
under
the
proposition
of
harmless
error
whether
or
not
a
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well
sir,
yes
sir.
the
chapman
versus
california
case
specifically
said
that
some
basic
rights
were
not
harmless
error.
for
instance
the
coerce
confession,
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
an
impartial
judge,
it
said
that
in
the
case.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
remember
that
it
did
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
that
is
the
--
yes
sir
that
is
the
contention
of
this
court.
mr.
mathew
robins
under
--
mr.
mathew
robins
under
the
law
today,
i
would
have
to
admit
that
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
because
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
error
if
it
were
in
fact
error
did
not
go
to
a
substantial
right
of
this
man.
he
had
all
the
substantive
rights
at
his
trial
to
reject
--
mr.
mathew
robins
but
so
were
the
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
it
is
true,
but
so
were
the
rights
of
all
the
defendants
for
instance
that
come
--
that
came
before
the
miranda
decision,
that
came
before
the
gideon
decision.
well,
that
was
made
retroactive
but
some
of
the
cases
that
were
not
made
retroactive,
their
rights
also
were
violated
but
this
court
has
decided
that
that
was
not
such
a
substantial
right
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive
and
i'm
submitting
to
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
and
i'm
saying
that
this
is
not
such
a
substantial
right
that
he
has
been
harmed.
mr.
mathew
robins
that
is
and
i
have
admitted
and
i
admit
now
that
would
seem
to
be
the
rule
where
that
case
decided
today,
but
i'm
saying
there
are
other
elements.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
don't
see
any
reason
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
sir,
this
would
be
the
standard
that
you
may
retry
a
man
for
conviction
set
aside.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
would
believe
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
your
honor,
i
have
not
considered
that,
i
don't
know.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
--
mr.
mathew
robins
it
might
be
--
mr.
mathew
robins
i
have
not
considered
that
but
however,
that
is
a
point
that
i
wish
i
had
considered
and
presented
to
the
court.
that
is
a
point
well
taken.
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
statute
of
limitation
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
sir
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
do
not
know
that
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
of
course
we
have
taken
this
case
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
he
was
tried
the
second
time
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
could
--
i
don't
know
that.
i
had
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
certainly.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
on
passing
then,
just
in
my
final
argument
on
this
question,
i
submitted
that
that
because
of
the
fact
he
did
get
a
lesser
sentence.
that
there
was
harmless
error
and
i
now
pass
to
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
benton.
extensively,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
benton
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
of
course
this
would
not
perhaps
be
a
proper
case
to
decide
retroactivity
of
benton.
but
nevertheless,
this
court
has
for
some
time
now
specially
since
1965
in
the
case
of
linkletter
versus
walker
set
out
certain
criteria
which
it
has
tried
to
follow
in
determining
whether
case
should
be
retroactive.
it
has
considered
the
prior
history
of
the
rule.
it
has
considered
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
new
rule
and
it
has
considered
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
new
rule
would
further
or
retard
its
operation.
and
throughout
these
cases
where
the
prospective
--
prospectivity
of
a
case
has
been
in
question,
it
has
applied
these
rules.
i
would
submit
that
insofar
as
benton
versus
maryland
that
the
prior
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
shown
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
state
and
upon
given
the
choice,
since
the
green
case
in
1957
or
1959,
whenever
it
was,
when
given
a
choice,
this
court
has
on
one
occasion
said
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
to
the
states
and
on
another
occasion,
cichos
versus
indiana
in
a
factual
situation
identical
i
submit
to
ours,
this
court
did
not
pass
on
the
question,
however,
it
did
say
in
dictum
that
it
was
--
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
i've
studied
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
in
pearce
if
your
honor
please.
the
question
that
was
specifically
posed
in
pearce
and
the
question
which
was
phrased
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
decision
was
weather
or
not
when
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant,
a
criminal
conviction
has
been
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
order,
to
what
extent
does
the
constitution
limit
the
imposition
of
a
harsher
sentence.
and
then
further
in
the
opinion
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
to
protect
three
things,
protection
against
repeated
prosecutions
after
an
acquittal,
protection
after
a
conviction
and
protection
against
the
imposition
of
repeated
punishments.
but
in
pearce,
the
only
question
posed
to
the
court
was
the
question
of
the
sentence.
it
was
not
really
confronted
with
the
question
that
we
have
here
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
consider
pearce
not
as
a
blanket
determination
that
benton
versus
maryland
should
be
retroactive
but
that
pearce
decided
only
that
insofar
as
the
imposition
of
harsher
sentences
are
concerned
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive.
and
i'm
further
--
i
emphasize
this
position
because
that
is
a
correction
that
can
be
made
with
the
minimum
of
effort
by
the
states.
it
need
only
do
it
administrative
--
administratively
and
need
not
have
subsequent
trials
as
would
be
required
by
retroactive
application
of
benton
versus
maryland.
so,
though
the
footnote
--
mr.
mathew
robins
particularly
one
--
one
your
honor
was
barktus
versus
illinois
which
was
in
the
late
50s,
1959,
the
earlier
one
was
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
though
that's
not
a
holding
of
the
court,
it
is
dictum,
that's
a
1958
decision.
also
dictum
i
suppose
--
mr.
mathew
robins
barktus
versus
illinois.
mr.
mathew
robins
oh
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
citation
in
front
of
me.
it's
a
1959
case.
the
other
case
was
cichos
versus
indiana,
the
very
--
nearly
the
last
paragraph
in
that
case.
that
case
did
suggest
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
mathew
robins
c
i
c
h
o
s.
mr.
mathew
robins
so
we
have
here
them
--
mr.
mathew
robins
oh.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
ashe,
the
facts
in
ashe
would
seem
to
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
of
the
three
propositions
set
out
in
pearce,
that
is
whether
benton
is
applicable
to
the
protection
to
the
defendant
against
subsequent
convict
--
subsequent
trials
after
an
acquittal,
that
would
seem
to
be
the
suggestion
in
ashe,
however,
ashe
i
respectfully
submit,
there's
no
more
than
to
incorporate
collateral
estoppel
into
the
double
jeopardy
provision
where
it
had
not
been
incorporated
earlier
and
in
fact
it
had
been
rejected
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
it
is
quite
explicit,
it
is.
mr.
mathew
robins
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
court's
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
and
north
carolina
versus
pearce
decided
the
same
day
as
benton,
the
court
unanimously
accorded
fully
retroactive
effect
to
the
benton
doctrine.
i
submit
to
the
court
however
there's
that
--
if
this
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
it's
--
yes
sir,
it
says
fully
retroactive,
but
this
is
--
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
it
is
applicable
to
the
other
elements
of
the
three,
then
it
is
a
departure
from
what
this
court
has
done
in
earlier
cases.
linkletter
versus
walker,
stovall
versus
denno,
jenkins
versus
delaware,
these
continuing
series
of
cases
where
this
court
has
considered
the
criteria
setout
in
linkletter
versus
walker,
prior
history,
purpose
and
effect.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--
however
--
mr.
mathew
robins
that's
a
difficult
bridge
to
cross
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
this
court
has
done
it
and
i've
tried
to
study
the
opinion.
for
instance
benton
versus
--
the
benton
versus
maryland
case
is
only
mentioned
one
time
that
there's
no
--
and
pearce,
there's
no
reference
in
pearce
to
the
other
elements,
the
three
that
this
court
set
out.
there's
no
reference
to
the
other
two
elements
and
the
effect
of
benton.
the
whole
case
turns
upon
imposition
of
harsher
sentences
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
this
decision
in
pearce
which
if
it
is
to
be
determined
that
it
is
retro
making
benton
retroactive
is
a
complete
departure
from
earlier
cases
where
this
court
has
considered
the
effect,
reliance,
the
desist
case
is
i
think
is
a
good
opinion
where
this
court
has
considered
what
all
of
this
will
do
to
the
state.
mr.
mathew
robins
it's
a
--
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
this
court
has
crossed
that
bridge.
i
was
seeking
to
urge
this
court
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--
to
consider
it
in
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--a
different
perspective
than
it
had
because
of
the
departure
from
its
earlier
decisions
in
determining
retroactivity.
i
was
urging
this
court
because
of
past
history
in
this
court
that
pearce
is
a
complete
departure
and
that
the
--
and
because
of
the
elements
set
out
in
linkletter
versus
walker,
the
states
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
this
court
would
resolve
benton
the
way
it
did.
in
fact
the
states
were
encouraged
to
believe
that
it
would
hold
differently.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
all
the
states
do
have
them.
mr.
mathew
robins
about
18
or
20
of
the
states
do
in
fact
provide
for
the
retrial
under
higher
charge.
mr.
mathew
robins
and
georgia
of
course
is
one
of
those
and
that's
why
we
have
this
problem
then.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
only
18
or
20
of
the
states
have
held
the
view
that
georgia
has
it.
you
may
retry
on
the
higher
offense.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
yes
sir
but
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
your
honor
but
please
remember
that
this
court
in
an
identical
factual
situation
in
brantley
versus
georgia,
a
1910
case
said
it
didn't
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
an
identical
factual
situation.
mr.
mathew
robins
no
--
well,
the
proposition
of
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
your
honor,
the
case
before
the
court
now
was
before
the
benton
decision.
mr.
mathew
robins
brantley
was
argued.
mr.
mathew
robins
so
i'm
saying
that
the
state
of
georgia
and
the
other
states
too
have
had
a
determination
by
this
court
at
least
since
1910
and
certainly
since
1930
whatever
it
was
in
the
palko
decision
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
states,
and
even
more
recently
since
1959
in
barktus
and
1966
in
cichos
and
all
of
a
sudden
now
the
states
have
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
retry
these
people
and
this
will
be
a
terrible
burden
on
the
states
because
some
of
these
people
have
been
in
jail
for
quite
a
long
time.
it
will
be
necessary
to
get
the
witnesses
and
revive
their
memories
and
this
will
be
a
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
mathew
robins
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not,
he
was
silent
on
the
fact
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
no,
green
--
green
wasn't
implied.
well,
this
court
in
columbia,
the
jury
was
silent
in
the
green
case
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
mathew
robins
but
this
court
has
determined
that
that
wasn't
implied
acquittal.
mr.
mathew
robins
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
the
state
of
georgia
there
was
no
implied
acquittal
because
the
law
provided
that
he
could
be
retried
which
must
reject
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine.
in
closing,
if
this
court
please,
i
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
criteria
set
out
in
linkletter
in
the
linkletter
versus
walker
case
as
carried
forward
in
many
subsequent
cases
deciding
retroactivity.
i
ask
this
court
to
not
apply
benton
retroactively
and
consider
the
burden
upon
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
reliance
upon
the
states
that
it
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
prior.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
it
must
mean
that
and
i
say
where
the
facts
like
as
they
were
in
green
where
the
man
received
a
death
sentence,
then
this
case
would
--
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
and
the
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
and
at
that
time
the
court
should
have
probably
passed
upon
a
proper
motion
raising
double
jeopardy.
that
would
have
--
mr.
mathew
robins
that's
right,
yes
sir,
but
i
say
all
this
was
vitiated
when
the
jury
rejected
that
apprehension
that
he
was
placed
under,
and
said
do
not
concern
yourself
with
that,
you
are
being
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
we
are
sorry
for
the
apprehension
but
you
have
not
been
convicted
of
that
murder
charge.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
i
cannot
deny
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
sir,
i
cannot
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
mathew
robins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
rise
now
to
respond
to
one
of
the
two
directors
of
this
court
wherein
this
court
asked
to
show
why
benton
versus
maryland
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
respond
to
that
firstly.
i
would
say
as
reluctantly
as
it
is
as
i
can
that
benton
versus
maryland
is
applicable
to
this
case
but
not
so
much
because
of
what
benton
versus
maryland
says,
but
because
it
made
green
applicable
to
this
case
and
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
which
was
a
federal
principle
prior
to
benton
versus
maryland.
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
escape
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine
for
green.
i'm
particularly
persuaded
to
this
decision
by
the
fact
that
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
ashe
versus
swenson
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
phrase,
run
the
gauntlet
in
green
meant
as
to
that
charge.
now,
i'm
afraid
that
in
this
case
that
is
perhaps
what
has
happened
to
mr.
price.
he
has
run
the
gauntlet
on
the
murder
charge.
mr.
mathew
robins
i'm
going
to
say
--
i
am
suggest
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
i'm
suggesting
that
because
in
the
state
of
georgia,
of
course,
they
do
not
come
back
and
say
that
he
is
acquitted
of
murder
and
he
is
found
guilty
of
voluntary
manslaughter
as
were
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
in
the
state
of
georgia,
they
can
return
a
verdict
for
manslaughter
and
it
maybe
because
and
this
suggests
conjecture
but
it
maybe
because
the
crime
does
not
warrant
the
punishment
which
murder
would
require,
that
is
death
or
life
imprisonment,
that
is
required
by
statute.
it
maybe
that
the
facts
as
presented
to
the
jury
or
such
that
they
may
feel
that
this
doesn't
warrant
that
kind
of
punishment
and
yet
there
is
sufficient
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
voluntary
manslaughter
conviction.
i
might
add
also
that
in
the
state
of
georgia,
a
jury
may
bring
back
a
conviction
for
a
lesser
crime
even
though
they
were
not
charged
on
that
lesser
crime
where
the
evidence
warrants
it.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
they
were
in
this
particular
case
but
i
emphasize
the
point
that
there
is
discretion.
mr.
mathew
robins
in
this
case?
voluntary
manslaughter
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
robins
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
to
my
knowledge
that
is
all.
the
only
other
lesser
crime
as
such
would
be
involuntary
manslaughter.
now,
the
judge
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
jury
may
reduce
the
punishment
to
that
as
for
a
misdemeanor
where
the
jury
recommends
it
on
voluntary
manslaughter
and
involuntary
manslaughter
but
not
for
murder.
the
jury
is
compelled
on
a
murder
charge
to
either
recommend
mercy
or
in
their
absence
it
would
be
a
death
sentence?
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
it's
a
strange
relationship,
if
your
honor
please.
in
the
death
--
in
the
murder
situation,
they
indirectly
fix
the
sentence.
if
they
do
not
bring
back
a
recommendation
of
mercy,
the
sentence
is
automatically
death.
if
they
bring
back
a
recommendation
of
mercy,
it
is
automatically
life.
in
the
other
situations
of
voluntary
manslaughter
and
involuntary
manslaughter,
they
may
fix
the
punishment.
they
may
recommend
a
punishment
i
believe
within
the
prescribed
range.
i
am
not
--
i
cannot
state
with
all
certainty
whether
the
judge
is
obligated
to
follow
that
recommendation
of
the
jury.
in
this
particular
case,
the
punishment
for
voluntary
manslaughter
is
1:20.
they
fix
punishment
at
10
to
15
initially
and
at
subsequently
at
10.
this
brings
to
mind
a
very
important
point
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this.
it
is
my
contention
as
my
brother
said
out
to
the
court
that
i
would
urge
this
court
to
find
that
this
man
has
not
been
harmed.
i
recognized
the
harmful
error
as
a
proposition
that
states
perhaps
overemphasized
the
fact
that
there
is
not
harmful
error.
i
say
here
there
was
no
harmful
error.
this
man
was
initially
sentenced
to
10
to
15
and
under
the
old
law
of
georgia
that
would
have
meant
that
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
a
conditional
release
which
is
tantamount
to
a
parole
at
the
end
of
10
years.
in
1964,
the
georgia
general
assembly
changed
the
law
and
required
that
sentences
be
made
definite
and
subsequently
the
--
and
a
second
trial,
mr.
price
was
sentenced
to
10
years.
this
meant
that
he
could
get
out
at
the
end
of
five
years
and
nine
months
assuming
all
good
behavior,
time
off
for
good
behavior.
so
he
has
received
a
material
benefit
by
the
act
of
the
general
assembly,
but
more
importantly,
he
has
not
been
harmed
in
what
has
happened
i
would
submit.
if
the
court
is
going
to
consider
the
hetenyi
proposition
then
it
is
considering
that
perhaps
the
jury
could
not
or
would
not
do
its
duty.
that
it
would
not
follow
the
directions
of
the
court.
in
this
particular
situation,
the
jury
rejected
the
charge
of
the
court
as
to
murder
and
brought
back
the
lesser
charge.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
did
do
their
duty
and
it
would
only
be
conjecture
that
that
they
might
have
done
something
else
had
they
not
been
--
had
there
not
been
evidence
on
murder.
mr.
mathew
robins
with
that
trial
today,
yes
sir.
of
course
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
that
is
my
point
in
so
far
as
applicability
of
the
benton
and
the
green
rule
made
that
comes
under
that.
i'm
persuaded
to
this
argument
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
this
is
quite
a
bit
different.
in
fact,
this
case
factually
is
different
than
any
other
case
that
i
can
find
in
the
records
of
this
court
with
the
possible
exception
of
cichos
versus
indiana
where
factually,
there
was
a
similar
situation
and
this
court
chose
not
to
pass
upon
it.
however,
getting
ahead
of
myself
however,
in
the
cichos
case
in
what
i
understood
to
be
just
dictum
it
did
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
proposition
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
but
factually,
this
case
is
different
and
because
of
the
facts
it
takes
it
out
from
benton,
takes
it
out
from
green
and
makes
it
a
new
case.
i
don't
believe
this
is
--
we
can
say
green
is
completely
applicable
because
there
that
man
came
back
with
a
death
sentence,
the
second
time,
yeah.
this
case,
this
man
has
come
back
with
something
even
less
than
he
got
the
first
time
in
so
far
as
time
to
be
served
in
prison.
mr.
mathew
robins
sir,
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
serve
anytime
after
--
mr.
mathew
robins
none
at
all
to
my
understanding.
mr.
mathew
robins
he
is
serving
now
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
but
he
did
not
serve
anytime
after
the
first
sentence.
however,
georgia
law
does
provide
that
where
one
remains
incarcerated
in
jail
during
an
appeal
they
will
reserve,
will
receive
benefit
for
that
time.
so
he
would
have
received
benefit
had
he
been
incarcerated.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
that
i
believe
i
would
have
to
admit
that
to
the
court.
i've
studied
the
cases.
i've
strained
for
some
distinguishing
characteristic
but
i
cannot
find
a
distinguishing
characteristic
and
as
i
stated
earlier,
i'm
also
--
persuaded
that
conclusion
by
your
honor's
dissent
in
ashe
versus
swenson
which
makes
reference
to
running
the
gauntlet
on
that
charge
and
if
we
apply
that
rationale
to
this
case,
mr.
price
ran
the
gauntlet
on
the
charge
of
murder
though
he
was
convicted
of
a
lesser
crime.
also,
i
must
recognize
that
in
us
versus
ball
that
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
not
determined
upon
the
punishment
that
it
receives
but
by
the
fact
whether
he
has
in
fact
been
tried
for
that
crime.
so,
it's
difficult
for
me
at
all
to
escape
this
but
not
withstanding
this
and
even
admitting
if
this
whould
be
an
admission
that
double
jeopardy
was
a
factor.
i'm
saying
there
are
other
elements
which
take
this
out
and
make
this
--
makes
this
harmless
error
instead
of
harmful
error,
and
of
course
the
chapman
versus
the
california
case
is
the
best
case
on
harmless
error
and
it
applied
in
that
case
a
test
in
faihey
versus
connecticut
which
said
that
where
there
is
reasonable
possibility
that
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
price
case,
the
jury
rejected
that
evidence
of
murder.
it
rejected
the
charge
of
the
court
and
in
essence
it
says
we
reject
any
evidence
on
murder.
we
find
that
it
is
not
an
applicable
situation
without
finding
innocence
or
quilt.
we're
saying
this
is
more
applicable,
voluntary
manslaughter.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
believe
your
honor
that
this
court
could
take
it
under
consideration
in
the
--
under
the
proposition
of
harmless
error
whether
or
not
a
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well
sir,
yes
sir.
the
chapman
versus
california
case
specifically
said
that
some
basic
rights
were
not
harmless
error.
for
instance
the
coerce
confession,
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
an
impartial
judge,
it
said
that
in
the
case.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
remember
that
it
did
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
that
is
the
--
yes
sir
that
is
the
contention
of
this
court.
mr.
mathew
robins
under
--
mr.
mathew
robins
under
the
law
today,
i
would
have
to
admit
that
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
because
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
error
if
it
were
in
fact
error
did
not
go
to
a
substantial
right
of
this
man.
he
had
all
the
substantive
rights
at
his
trial
to
reject
--
mr.
mathew
robins
but
so
were
the
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
it
is
true,
but
so
were
the
rights
of
all
the
defendants
for
instance
that
come
--
that
came
before
the
miranda
decision,
that
came
before
the
gideon
decision.
well,
that
was
made
retroactive
but
some
of
the
cases
that
were
not
made
retroactive,
their
rights
also
were
violated
but
this
court
has
decided
that
that
was
not
such
a
substantial
right
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive
and
i'm
submitting
to
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
and
i'm
saying
that
this
is
not
such
a
substantial
right
that
he
has
been
harmed.
mr.
mathew
robins
that
is
and
i
have
admitted
and
i
admit
now
that
would
seem
to
be
the
rule
where
that
case
decided
today,
but
i'm
saying
there
are
other
elements.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
don't
see
any
reason
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
sir,
this
would
be
the
standard
that
you
may
retry
a
man
for
conviction
set
aside.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
would
believe
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
your
honor,
i
have
not
considered
that,
i
don't
know.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
--
mr.
mathew
robins
it
might
be
--
mr.
mathew
robins
i
have
not
considered
that
but
however,
that
is
a
point
that
i
wish
i
had
considered
and
presented
to
the
court.
that
is
a
point
well
taken.
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
statute
of
limitation
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
sir
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mathew
robins
i
do
not
know
that
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
of
course
we
have
taken
this
case
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
he
was
tried
the
second
time
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
i
could
--
i
don't
know
that.
i
had
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
certainly.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
on
passing
then,
just
in
my
final
argument
on
this
question,
i
submitted
that
that
because
of
the
fact
he
did
get
a
lesser
sentence.
that
there
was
harmless
error
and
i
now
pass
to
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
benton.
extensively,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
benton
is
not
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case
and
of
course
this
would
not
perhaps
be
a
proper
case
to
decide
retroactivity
of
benton.
but
nevertheless,
this
court
has
for
some
time
now
specially
since
1965
in
the
case
of
linkletter
versus
walker
set
out
certain
criteria
which
it
has
tried
to
follow
in
determining
whether
case
should
be
retroactive.
it
has
considered
the
prior
history
of
the
rule.
it
has
considered
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
new
rule
and
it
has
considered
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
new
rule
would
further
or
retard
its
operation.
and
throughout
these
cases
where
the
prospective
--
prospectivity
of
a
case
has
been
in
question,
it
has
applied
these
rules.
i
would
submit
that
insofar
as
benton
versus
maryland
that
the
prior
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
shown
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
state
and
upon
given
the
choice,
since
the
green
case
in
1957
or
1959,
whenever
it
was,
when
given
a
choice,
this
court
has
on
one
occasion
said
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
to
the
states
and
on
another
occasion,
cichos
versus
indiana
in
a
factual
situation
identical
i
submit
to
ours,
this
court
did
not
pass
on
the
question,
however,
it
did
say
in
dictum
that
it
was
--
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
i've
studied
--
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
in
pearce
if
your
honor
please.
the
question
that
was
specifically
posed
in
pearce
and
the
question
which
was
phrased
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
decision
was
weather
or
not
when
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant,
a
criminal
conviction
has
been
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
order,
to
what
extent
does
the
constitution
limit
the
imposition
of
a
harsher
sentence.
and
then
further
in
the
opinion
this
court
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
to
protect
three
things,
protection
against
repeated
prosecutions
after
an
acquittal,
protection
after
a
conviction
and
protection
against
the
imposition
of
repeated
punishments.
but
in
pearce,
the
only
question
posed
to
the
court
was
the
question
of
the
sentence.
it
was
not
really
confronted
with
the
question
that
we
have
here
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
consider
pearce
not
as
a
blanket
determination
that
benton
versus
maryland
should
be
retroactive
but
that
pearce
decided
only
that
insofar
as
the
imposition
of
harsher
sentences
are
concerned
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive.
and
i'm
further
--
i
emphasize
this
position
because
that
is
a
correction
that
can
be
made
with
the
minimum
of
effort
by
the
states.
it
need
only
do
it
administrative
--
administratively
and
need
not
have
subsequent
trials
as
would
be
required
by
retroactive
application
of
benton
versus
maryland.
so,
though
the
footnote
--
mr.
mathew
robins
particularly
one
--
one
your
honor
was
barktus
versus
illinois
which
was
in
the
late
50s,
1959,
the
earlier
one
was
hoag
versus
new
jersey,
though
that's
not
a
holding
of
the
court,
it
is
dictum,
that's
a
1958
decision.
also
dictum
i
suppose
--
mr.
mathew
robins
barktus
versus
illinois.
mr.
mathew
robins
oh
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
citation
in
front
of
me.
it's
a
1959
case.
the
other
case
was
cichos
versus
indiana,
the
very
--
nearly
the
last
paragraph
in
that
case.
that
case
did
suggest
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
mathew
robins
c
i
c
h
o
s.
mr.
mathew
robins
so
we
have
here
them
--
mr.
mathew
robins
oh.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
ashe,
the
facts
in
ashe
would
seem
to
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
of
the
three
propositions
set
out
in
pearce,
that
is
whether
benton
is
applicable
to
the
protection
to
the
defendant
against
subsequent
convict
--
subsequent
trials
after
an
acquittal,
that
would
seem
to
be
the
suggestion
in
ashe,
however,
ashe
i
respectfully
submit,
there's
no
more
than
to
incorporate
collateral
estoppel
into
the
double
jeopardy
provision
where
it
had
not
been
incorporated
earlier
and
in
fact
it
had
been
rejected
in
hoag
versus
new
jersey.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
it
is
quite
explicit,
it
is.
mr.
mathew
robins
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
court's
decision
in
benton
versus
maryland,
and
north
carolina
versus
pearce
decided
the
same
day
as
benton,
the
court
unanimously
accorded
fully
retroactive
effect
to
the
benton
doctrine.
i
submit
to
the
court
however
there's
that
--
if
this
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
it's
--
yes
sir,
it
says
fully
retroactive,
but
this
is
--
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
it
is
applicable
to
the
other
elements
of
the
three,
then
it
is
a
departure
from
what
this
court
has
done
in
earlier
cases.
linkletter
versus
walker,
stovall
versus
denno,
jenkins
versus
delaware,
these
continuing
series
of
cases
where
this
court
has
considered
the
criteria
setout
in
linkletter
versus
walker,
prior
history,
purpose
and
effect.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--
however
--
mr.
mathew
robins
that's
a
difficult
bridge
to
cross
your
honor.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
this
court
has
done
it
and
i've
tried
to
study
the
opinion.
for
instance
benton
versus
--
the
benton
versus
maryland
case
is
only
mentioned
one
time
that
there's
no
--
and
pearce,
there's
no
reference
in
pearce
to
the
other
elements,
the
three
that
this
court
set
out.
there's
no
reference
to
the
other
two
elements
and
the
effect
of
benton.
the
whole
case
turns
upon
imposition
of
harsher
sentences
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
this
decision
in
pearce
which
if
it
is
to
be
determined
that
it
is
retro
making
benton
retroactive
is
a
complete
departure
from
earlier
cases
where
this
court
has
considered
the
effect,
reliance,
the
desist
case
is
i
think
is
a
good
opinion
where
this
court
has
considered
what
all
of
this
will
do
to
the
state.
mr.
mathew
robins
it's
a
--
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
this
court
has
crossed
that
bridge.
i
was
seeking
to
urge
this
court
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--
to
consider
it
in
--
mr.
mathew
robins
--a
different
perspective
than
it
had
because
of
the
departure
from
its
earlier
decisions
in
determining
retroactivity.
i
was
urging
this
court
because
of
past
history
in
this
court
that
pearce
is
a
complete
departure
and
that
the
--
and
because
of
the
elements
set
out
in
linkletter
versus
walker,
the
states
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
this
court
would
resolve
benton
the
way
it
did.
in
fact
the
states
were
encouraged
to
believe
that
it
would
hold
differently.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
all
the
states
do
have
them.
mr.
mathew
robins
about
18
or
20
of
the
states
do
in
fact
provide
for
the
retrial
under
higher
charge.
mr.
mathew
robins
and
georgia
of
course
is
one
of
those
and
that's
why
we
have
this
problem
then.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
only
18
or
20
of
the
states
have
held
the
view
that
georgia
has
it.
you
may
retry
on
the
higher
offense.
mr.
mathew
robins
well,
yes
sir
but
i
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir
your
honor
but
please
remember
that
this
court
in
an
identical
factual
situation
in
brantley
versus
georgia,
a
1910
case
said
it
didn't
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
an
identical
factual
situation.
mr.
mathew
robins
no
--
well,
the
proposition
of
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
mathew
robins
no
your
honor,
the
case
before
the
court
now
was
before
the
benton
decision.
mr.
mathew
robins
brantley
was
argued.
mr.
mathew
robins
so
i'm
saying
that
the
state
of
georgia
and
the
other
states
too
have
had
a
determination
by
this
court
at
least
since
1910
and
certainly
since
1930
whatever
it
was
in
the
palko
decision
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
states,
and
even
more
recently
since
1959
in
barktus
and
1966
in
cichos
and
all
of
a
sudden
now
the
states
have
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
retry
these
people
and
this
will
be
a
terrible
burden
on
the
states
because
some
of
these
people
have
been
in
jail
for
quite
a
long
time.
it
will
be
necessary
to
get
the
witnesses
and
revive
their
memories
and
this
will
be
a
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
mathew
robins
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
not,
he
was
silent
on
the
fact
that
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
no,
green
--
green
wasn't
implied.
well,
this
court
in
columbia,
the
jury
was
silent
in
the
green
case
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
mathew
robins
but
this
court
has
determined
that
that
wasn't
implied
acquittal.
mr.
mathew
robins
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
the
state
of
georgia
there
was
no
implied
acquittal
because
the
law
provided
that
he
could
be
retried
which
must
reject
the
implied
acquittal
doctrine.
in
closing,
if
this
court
please,
i
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
criteria
set
out
in
linkletter
in
the
linkletter
versus
walker
case
as
carried
forward
in
many
subsequent
cases
deciding
retroactivity.
i
ask
this
court
to
not
apply
benton
retroactively
and
consider
the
burden
upon
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
reliance
upon
the
states
that
it
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
prior.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
it
must
mean
that
and
i
say
where
the
facts
like
as
they
were
in
green
where
the
man
received
a
death
sentence,
then
this
case
would
--
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir.
mr.
mathew
robins
and
the
--
mr.
mathew
robins
yes
sir,
and
at
that
time
the
court
should
have
probably
passed
upon
a
proper
motion
raising
double
jeopardy.
that
would
have
--
mr.
mathew
robins
that's
right,
yes
sir,
but
i
say
all
this
was
vitiated
when
the
jury
rejected
that
apprehension
that
he
was
placed
under,
and
said
do
not
concern
yourself
with
that,
you
are
being
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter
