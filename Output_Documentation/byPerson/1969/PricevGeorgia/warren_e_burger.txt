mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
own
way
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
your
position
mr.
wallace
that
the
second
trial
he
could
be
charged
and
tried
only
under
the
charge
of
voluntary
manslaughter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
cite
green
against
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
were
you
so
much
concerned
about
whether
he
was
reindicted
or
whether
was
tried
on
any
charge
higher
than
voluntary
manslaughter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatever
he's
thinking
of
it
is
if
there's
a
practical
matter
in
the
second
trial,
the
district
--
the
trial
judge
had
ruled
that
he
would
submit
no
charges
to
the
jury
higher
than
voluntary
manslaughter,
would
that
have
satisfied
your
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
he
have
done
that
under
georgia
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
if
he
had
been
indicted
the
second
time
for
voluntary
manslaughter,
under
georgia
law,
what
other
offenses
are
lesser
included
offenses
under
that
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
worst,
there's
--
there
was
--
are
lesser
included
offenses
under
georgia
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
lesser
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
included
offenses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
position
is
that
faced
with
that
the
jury
might
have
found
them
one
of
those
lesser
included
offenses
if
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
murder
indictment
were
not
hanging
over?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
robins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
georgia
law,
does
the
jury
fix
the
penalty
in
every
case
or
is
it
just
an
option
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
general
robins,
the
language
the
constitution
prohibition
is
against
being
twice
placed
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
now,
when
they
tried
him
the
second
time,
if
the
rationale
of
the
green
case
carries
over
and
that
applies
here
implied
acquittal,
was
he
not
then
placed
in
jeopardy
of
a
conviction
of
murder
eventhough
in
fact
the
jury
returned
the
lesser
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
better
to
differ
mr.
wallace
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
won't
you
let
us
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
address
yourself
to
that
question,
will
you
also
indicate
whether
there
are
any
legal
barriers
to
being
tried
under
the
existing
indictment
provided
the
court
does
not
submit
any
charge
higher
than
voluntary
manslaughter
to
the
jury?
mr.
wallace
seemed
to
concede
that
that
would
have
satisfied
his
position
at
the
time
of
the
second
trial.
i
do
not
take
that
as
a
concession
that
he
would
concede
it
now
necessarily,
but
if
you
will
address
yourself
to
that
point
also
in
your
memorandum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
robins,
the
courts
--
the
court
is
not
unmindful
of
the
burdens
that
these
things
can
impose
on
the
state
sometimes
but
when
you
consider
the
language
of
the
constitution,
is
it
that
he
shall
not
twice
be
placed
in
jeopardy,
that
must
mean
he
shall
not
twice
be
put
at
the
risk
of
this
conviction,
is
that
not
what
it
must
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
let's
put
ourselves
back
in
the
posture
that
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
first
trial
and
the
verdict
and
it
was
relatively
a
much
less
sentence
than
he
might
have
gotten?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then
he's
put
by
the
state
of
georgia
at
risk
again
and
the
risk
is
not
the
risk
of
being
found
guilty
of
an
offense
that
would
give
him
10
to
15
years
but
he
is
again
put
at
risk
of
the
death
sentence,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
he
thinks
so
even
if
his
lawyers
may
tell
him
about
the
green
case
and
about
the
benton
case
and
the
other
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
isn't
that
kind
of
a
--
isn't
that
kind
of
an
apprehension,
the
fear,
the
risk,
the
kind
of
thing
that's
embraced
in
the
term
jeopardy
under
one
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
didn't
and
that's
why
we're
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
meantime,
he
and
if
he
has
a
family
were
subject
to
that
apprehension,
not
fear
but
jeopardy,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
turn
the
clock
back
on
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
appropriate
in
your
judgment
and
i
want
you
to
consider
this
question
before
you
answer
because
perhaps
you
wouldn't
want
to
answer
it
today.
would
it
be
appropriate
to
--
if
the
court
found
for
you
on
the
basic
issue
of
double
jeopardy
to
remand
the
case
giving
georgia
the
alternative
of
reindicting
him
if
their
law
permits
or
trying
him
under
the
existing
indictment
but
with
a
limitation
that
no
charge
higher
than
voluntary
manslaughter
could
be
submitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wallace,
thank
you
for
your
submission.
