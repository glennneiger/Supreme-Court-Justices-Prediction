justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
its
possible
to
argue
that
now
under
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
there
might
be
prior
--
an
acquittal
on
the
first
degree
of
murder
under
these
circumstances
of
a
general
jury
verdict
of
manslaughter,
still
the
law
of
your
jurisdiction
is
different
and
that
of
jury
verdict
of
manslaughter
after
a
trial
on
an
indictment
of
murder
is
not
under
the
law
of
your
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
it's
not
little
as
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
were
here
though,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
lesser
crimes
were
they
charged
off?
justice
potter
stewart
in
all?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
general
robins,
you're
conceding
in
this
aspect
of
your
argument?
you're
conceding
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
granted
the
motion
and
should
have
allowed
the
state
to
try
him
only
for
manslaughter?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
disputing
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
aspect
of
your
argument.
what
you're
saying
that
since
as
it
turned
out,
he
was
convicted
of
no
more
than
manslaughter
and
indeed
given
a
lower
sentence
than
he
received
its
the
first
trial.
it
was
completely
harmless
error
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
no
constitutional
error
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
quite
a
case
quite
unlike
green
because
in
green
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
tried
again
and
that
time
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
this
therefore
is
quite
different
case?
justice
potter
stewart
has
he
been
given
full
credit
in
his
--
in
serving
of
his
second
sentence
for
the
time
he
served
and
as
result
of
the
first
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
none
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
supposing
you
--
supposing
you
lose
this
case,
can
you
reindict
this
man
for
manslaughter?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
ashe
against
swenson?
justice
potter
stewart
and
pearce
against
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
359
us
121.
justice
potter
stewart
were
you
going
to
say
something
about
the
--
would
you
whether
ashe
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
dealt
with
this
question?
justice
potter
stewart
the
opinion
by
footnote
or
otherwise,
didn't
it
not
say
something
explicit
in
the
question
of
retroactivity?
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
it
lead?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
aware
of
the
word
there
is
fully,
is
it?
fully
retroactive?
justice
potter
stewart
difficulty
is
i
think
that
general
robins
as
my
brother
brennan
has
implied
in
his
question,
ashe
could
not
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was.
it
couldn't
--
the
judgment
couldn't
have
been
reached,
it
was
reached
in
ashe
without
holding
that
the
doctrine
of
benton
against
maryland
was
fully
retroactive,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
did
the
--
how
did
they
cross
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
bridge
for
better
or
for
worse.
justice
potter
stewart
so
haven't
we
done
it
difficult
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
involves
the
fourth
amendment
where
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there's
the
searching
officers
act
to
after
the
brief
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
part
of
reason
is
relying
on
the
existing
on
the
court
decision
of
that
but
haven't
we
as
i
say
rightly
or
wrongly,
for
better
or
for
worse
haven't
--
hasn't
the
court
whether
to
approve
or
not
and
hasn't
the
court
crossed
that
bridge.
if
not
in
pearce
then
at
least
in
ashe?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
ashe
possibly
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was
without
holding
the
doctrine
of
benton
against
maryland
retroactive?
ashe
came
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
remember
on
collateral
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
collateral
proceedings
and
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
potter
stewart
to
cross,
to
go
back
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
cross
the
line
now?
justice
potter
stewart
every
state
has
--
has
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy
usually
in
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
one
or
two
or
three
by
either
statute
or
court
decision
and
while
they're
not
exactly
coincidental
with
the
guarantee
as
the
federal
constitution,
they're
so
close
that
the
disruption
of
state
procedures
would
be
minimal,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
georgia
under
4208
georgia
that
that
at
the
first
trial
he
was
not
in
fact
acquitted
of
murder,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
law
in
georgia,
that
he
was
not
acquitted?
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
the
law
as
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
construed
by
this
court
in
green,
is
that
you
point
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
and
nowadays
the
jury
has
to
fix
the
--
or
fix
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
and
number
of
year?
justice
potter
stewart
no
longer
can
the
jury
say
10
to
15
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
manslaughter?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
if
the
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
must
may
the
jury
come
in
and
say
we
find
him
guilty
and
we
recommend
a
sentence
from
one
to
20
years?
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
it
the
first
trial
from
10
to
15
years?
justice
potter
stewart
second
trial
they
fixed
it
at
10
years?
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
understood
in
the
course
of
oral
argument
here
that
the
law
was
changed
in
the
interim
and
that
a
jury
must
now
fix
it
a
definite
number
of
years,
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
did
i?
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
second
case
in
any
event
the
jury
did
fix
a
definite
number
of
year
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
conviction
they
did
not?
justice
potter
stewart
10
to
15.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
its
possible
to
argue
that
now

is

and
that
of

after
a
trial
on
an
indictment
of
murder
is
not
under
the
law
of
your
jurisdiction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
it's
not
little
as
first
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
were
here
though,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
lesser
crimes
were
they
charged
off?
justice
potter
stewart
in
all?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
general
robins,
you're
conceding
in
this
aspect
of
your
argument?
you're
conceding
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
granted
the
motion
and
should
have
allowed
the
state
to
try
him
only
for
manslaughter?
justice

stewart
you
are
disputing
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
aspect
of
your

what
you're

that

it

and
no

--
justice

is
that
your

justice

stewart
this
is
quite
a

quite

in

he

and
that

has

supposing

can
you
reindict

justice

how
about
