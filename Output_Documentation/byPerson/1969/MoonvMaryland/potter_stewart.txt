justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
just
before
you
leave
the
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
a
credit
was
given
by
defendant
to
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
no
issue
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
that
aspect
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
pearce
and
simpson?
justice
potter
stewart
full
credit
was
given
of
course,
that's
good.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
reliance
i
suppose
was
that
until
pearce
and
simpson,
any
state
felt
free
on
a
retrial,
any
trial
judge
on
a
retrial
of
somebody
who'd
previously
been
convicted,
felt
entirely
free
because
that
was
the
rule,
was
an
absence
of
any
other
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
entirely
free
to
sentence
of
the
person
before
him
who
would
be
convicted
in
a
court
as
just
though
this
for
a
new
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
do
you
read
pearce
and
simpson?
justice
potter
stewart
pearce
and
simpson
said
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
was
no
absolute
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
law
of
re-sentence
at
a
new
trial,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
pearce
and
simpson
was
wrongly
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
wrong
and
that
the
dissenters
in
that
case
were
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
--
that
is
basically
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
in
the
stroud
that
the
man
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
at
first
trial
and
to
death
sentence
at
the
second?
justice
potter
stewart
stroud
was
the
birdman
of
alcatraz,
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
got
death.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
plea
of
not
guilty
at
the
first
trial,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
both
crimes
of
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
convictions
on
both
case?
justice
potter
stewart
except
in
the
second
case,
it
was
for
additional
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
charges.
justice
potter
stewart
you
agree
as
i
understand
it
general
borgerding
with
the
basic
holding
and
with
the
full
retroactivity
of
the
basic
holding
in
pearce
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
sentencing
judge,
that
is
after
a
second
trial,
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
out
of
motivations
of
vindictiveness.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
the
basic
constitutional
holding
of
pearce?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
concede
that
is
always
been
the
rule
of
due
process
that
it
--
to
that
extent
is
fully
retroactive.
do
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
potter
stewart
long
before
this
court
enunciated
such
a
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
there
is
no
question
about
the
full
retroactivity
if
that's
the
proper
word
for
that
basic
holding
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
you
would
--
we
--
you're
in
agreement
on
that
as
i
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
and
that
was
the
holding
of
pearce?
justice
potter
stewart
and
pearce
went
on
to
say
that
in
order
to
insure
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
argument
basically
is
that
by
reason
of
this
affidavit,
there
was
substantial
compliance
with
the
rule
of
the
pearce
case
and
if
--
and
secondly
if
you're
mistaken
about
that,
then
the
rule
should
not
be
retroactive?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
in
your
submission
is
--
shows
that
the
reason
he
sentenced
him
to
a
higher
sentence
was
not
in
any
part
based
upon
vindictiveness
and
therefore
there
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
substantial
compliance
with
the
rule
of
the
pearce
case.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
court
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
did,
that's
not
an
issue,
that's
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
just
before
you
leave
the
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
a

was
