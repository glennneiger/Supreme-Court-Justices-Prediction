number
267,
moon
against
maryland
will
go
over
them
monday
morning
at
10
o'clock.
the
next
case
to
be
heard
today
will
be
269,
price
against
georgia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
must
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we'll
stay
right
on
the
original
schedule,
but
we
won't
hear
the
georgia
case
today.
i
hope
that
premature
postponement
didn't
disconcert
you
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sure
it
didn't?
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
period
of
time
and
this
number
of
people
as
sufficient
to
let
the
law
of
probability
have
any
meaningful
exercise?
this
is
just
a
very
short
period
of
time
in
a
very
small
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
not
the
figures
perhaps
in
maryland,
i'm
talking
about
you
are
projecting
this
to
the
49
other
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
jacques.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
borgerding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
all
of
this
is
in
the
first
trial,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
the
thing
that
puzzles
me.
in
the
second
case,
was
there
a
trial
on
additional
charge
of
larceny?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
did
not
appear
in
the
first
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
punishment
imposed
for
that
in
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
--
the
second
judge's
affidavit
which
seems
to
indicate
that
he
rested
in
part
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
additional
criminal
act
in
the
second
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
you
arguing
that
if
it
does,
the
affidavit
of
the
--
of
judge
pugh
furnishes
substantial
reasons
for
a
different
sentence
because
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
further
factor
here
that
the
--
that
you
do
have
an
intervening
event?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
have
an
intervening
event
in
the
form
of
the
abandonment
by
the
state
of
maryland
of
one
of
its
charges
in
the
first
trial
which
was
not
abandoned
in
the
second
trial,
but
became
the
basis
of
another
count,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
all
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
why
the
sentence
was
increased,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
sure
it
could
be
spelled
out
this
record.
was
the
affidavit
of
the
judge
in
the
second
trial,
judge
pugh
available
in
the
files
when
petition
for
the
writ
was
filed
here
or
when
it
was
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
--
i
notice
that
it's
dated
in
october
1969
and
that
the
writ
was
granted
in
some
time
in
1968.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
that
time
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
explanation
of
judge
pugh
was
not
before
the
court
in
granting
certiorari?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
do
this
to
mediate
the
problem
of
the
june
23,
1969?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
i
take
it
that
suppose
it
could
be
arguable
at
least
that
judge
pugh
having
in
mind
the
1896
rule
in
maryland
going
back
to
1896,
had
all
these
things
in
mind
substantially
at
the
time
he
sentenced
him
in
the
second
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
arguable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
that
if
since
1896,
this
has
been
the
rule
in
maryland,
i
think
as
someone
has
told
us
several
times
today
that
it's
presumed
that
judges
do
what
they
are
supposed
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
friend
argued
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
10
minutes
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
don't
read
pearce
the
way
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
wait
a
minute,
you've
lost
me,
he
didn't
plead
guilty
at
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
did
more
than
that,
he
did
more
than
that.
his
testimony
--
his
testimony
under
oath
was
very
different
in
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial.
it
wasn't
in
the
sentencing
process
alone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
have
just
read
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
record
out
of
the
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
quite
a
difference,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
judges
would
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jacques.
thank
you
general
for
your
submission.
the
case
is
submitted.
