mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
accommodate
my
brother
and
inform
him
while
he
made
the
statement
that
he
does
no
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals,
maybe
he
was
limited
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland.
but
as
far
as
the
court
of
special
appeals
which
is
an
appellate
court,
they
did
reverse
the
reeves
case
simply
because
they'd
felt
that
the
trial
judge
exceeded
his
authority
and
it
possibly
foreshadowed
this
court's
decision
in
as
far
as
credit
for
time
served.
i
think
the
pearce
case
held
that
while
the
sentence
is
a
nullity
on
the
first
conviction,
the
time
actually
served
cannot
be
a
nullity,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
the
special
appeals
held
not
in
those
exact
terms,
but
in
that
case
since
reeves
had
been
given
a
life
sentence,
he
had
spent
6
years
in
prison.
the
second
time
around,
when
it
was
reversed
in
the
federal
court,
he
received
a
20
year
sentence,
it
was
a
crime
of
rape
and
the
judge
gave
him
20
years
but
did
not
take
in
to
consideration
the
fact
that
mr.
reeves
had
actually
spent
6
years
in
jail.
and
so
therefore,
the
court
of
special
appeals
held
that
this
was
in
effect
increase
in
the
statutory
sentence
of
20
years
that
reeves
was
entitled
to
and
they
reversed
the
case
and
our
court
of
appeals
for
their
own
reasons
did
not
grant
cert.
the
state,
mr.
jacques
is
correct,
the
state
took
a
cert
in
that
case
insofar
as
we
were
trying
to
resolve
the
question
of
moon
which
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time,
reeves
and
also
another
case,
williams
versus
state
dealing
with
jail
time,
that
is
the
time
a
defendant
spends
in
jail
pending
the
trial
as
differentiated
from
sentence
time.
now,
as
to
the
statistics
that
we
quote
on
page
38,
had
no
time
to
mean
to
infer
that
this
11
increased
sentence
applies
to
all
retrials
in
the
state
of
maryland.
this
is
limited
as
indicated
in
the
brief
only
to
schowgurow
cases,
not
to
cases
that
have
been
reversed
because
of
double
jeopardy
problems,
evidentiary
problems
and
a
variety
of
reversals
that
come
through.
this
is
only
limited
and
it
was
only
entered
into
the
statistics
of
finding
out
this
to
contradict
this
philosophy,
this
pragmatic
philosophy
that
judges
on
the
second
trial
will
vindictively,
systematically
is
the
word
that's
used
in
the
law
review
article
that
is
duke
law
journal
systematically
would
increase
sentence.
this
would
indicate
that
in
maryland
on
the
schowgurow
that
out
of
the
85
cases
that
we
were
able
to
come
up
with
retrials,
61
got
it
a
decrease
in
sentence,
that's
72%.
now
and
incidentally,
this
was
not
a
figure
on
the
sentence
itself
because
that's
only
one
consideration
determined
whether
he
may
and
got
a
decrease
in
sentence,
you
must
determine
the
date
of
his
first
sentence
to
make
sure
that
the
second
sentence
covers
that
same
period
of
time
and
this
was
figured
on
that
basis.
someone
could
get
a
lesser
sentence
but
in
effect
served
more
time,
if
he
did
not
get
credit
for
the
time
served.
now,
i
think
that
the
question
here
in
view
of
the
pearce
decision
by
this
honorable
court,
the
question
before
us
today
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
pearce
court
held
that
on
a
retrial,
a
man
can
get
a
heavier
sentence.
the
main
fear
--
there
was
two
problems
there.
one
was
credit
for
time
served.
the
other
was
the
fear
of
the
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
judge.
so
therefore,
i
think
it's
incumbent
to
question
before
this
court
today.
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
the
trial
record
of
the
second
trial
would
support
the
fact
that
judge
pugh,
sentencing
judge
had
ample
reasons
or
was
his
sentence,
not
necessarily
just
a
file,
or
that
could
be
a
question
of
debate
but
whether
it
was
given
in
conformity
with
the
evidence
of
that
particular
case.
and
certainly,
it
has
been
the
law
in
maryland
at
all
times
since
1896
in
the
mitchell
case
that
if
a
judge
sentenced
for
an
improper
motive,
death
sentence
should
be
set
aside.
we
would
say
that
a
vindictive
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
judge
in
penalizing
the
man
for
taking
an
appeal
is
certainly
an
unworthy
to
note
and
it
should
be
set
aside.
now,
i
would
--
well,
no
question
has
been
raised
as
to
the
guilt
of
this
particular
man.
i
think
it's
essential
that
a
factual
outline
of
the
crime
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
this
was
a
prosecution
for
armed
robbery
and
assault
with
intent
to
murder
and
larceny
of
a
female
hardware
clerk
who
was
on
her
way
to
deposit
money
in
the
bank.
this
was
in
broad
daylight
in
the
shopping
center
just
to
the
northwest
of
here
and
as
she
was
walking
to
that
bank,
she
was
attacked
by
the
defendant
moon.
the
evidence
will
indicate
that
he
struck
her
and
beat
her
to
the
ground
with
a
lead
pipe
that
he
had
fashioned
the
night
before
by
putting
tar
tape
around
it.
he
was
a
former
coworker
of
the
victim.
he
knew
the
victim,
the
victim
knew
him.
so
it
was
essential
to
this
operation
of
this
crime
that
she
could
not
be
able
to
identify
him.
and
that's
exactly
he
was
successful
because
the
beating
was
so
severe
that
this
woman
could
not
identify
moon
at
the
first
trial
and
could
not
identify
him
at
the
second
trial
two
years
later
because
she
was
suffering
from
amnesia
brought
on
by
this
brutal
beating
about
the
head.
now,
so
the
first
trial,
the
judge
at
the
first
trial
had
before
him
the
following.
he
had
a
witness
to
the
peer,
this
victim
who
said
that
she
couldn't
remember
any
of
the
details.
this
was
six
months
after
the
crime.
she
had
lost
her
memory
and
she
couldn't
--
all
she
could
tell
him
was
the
name
of
her
physicians.
the
blackout
on
this
young
lady
was
from
five-day
period,
the
day
before
to
a
mere
four
days
thereafter
the
crime.
she
couldn't
remember
or
give
any
details,
so
the
first
trial
was
limited
to
a
description
of
her
injury
by
people
that
found
her
laying
on
the
sidewalk.
in
addition,
after
the
evidence,
it
was
a
jury
trial,
it
took
two
days.
the
defendant
when
he
was
called
or
took
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf,
he
admitted
--
he
admitted
that
he
made
the
weapon.
he
also
admitted
that
he
was
there
at
the
shopping
center.
he
admitted
striking
the
lady.
in
reading
the
record,
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion,
there
is
a
tone
of
remorse
and
regret
that
as
he
stated
this
and
that
he
was
sorry
that
he
hurt
her,
that
he
liked
her
and
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
her.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir
and
the
point
of
bringing
this
out
is
to
the
difference
in
sentence,
all
judges
vary
well
not
all,
but
there
is
a
despairing
sentencing
and
it's
unfortunate
but
as
long
as
we
have
human
beings
to
sentence
people
rather
than
computers,
we
are
going
to
have
disparity
of
sentences.
now,
so
mr.
moon
was
convicted
and
got
12
years
and
as
mr.
jacques
has
indicated,
he
recited
the
chronological
order
that
it
was
reversed
because
of
schowgurow.
now,
what
took
place
at
the
second
trial?
the
second
trial,
two
years
later,
the
woman
comes
in
and
she
testifies
again
and
she
is
--
has
continued
to
have
amnesia
as
to
this
five-day
period.
she
testified
that
she
is
still
under
the
doctor's
care.
two
years
later,
still
under
medical
care,
at
this
trial,
the
doctor
appears
and
he
testifies
as
to
the
medical
description
of
the
terms
that
she
was
suffering
among
other
things,
a
cerebral
concussion.
at
this
time,
it
was
a
jury
trial
that
took
two
days
incidentally
and
at
this
time,
moon
did
not
take
the
stand,
that's
what
his
privilege.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
judge
or
the
jury
rather
found
him
guilty,
guilty
of
--
it's
very
true,
guilty
of
armed
robbery,
guilty
of
larceny
and
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
was
not
brought
at
the
first
trial.
now,
when
the
--
moon
was
asked
by
the
court,
"would
you
--
do
you
have
anything
you
would
like
to
say
before
i
enter
sentence?"
he
was
also
asked
or
the
court
asked
defense
counsel
whether
they
want
a
pre-sentence
report
and
that
was
turned
down
and
they
wanted
sentence
there.
moon
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
as
to
why
the
court
should
be
lenient
was
because
he
did
not
commit
the
crime.
he
was
not
there
and
he
denied
hitting
the
woman.
the
court
wasn't
--
should
grin
at
this,
it
didn't
know.
the
defense
counsel
if
you
read
the
record,
will
indicate
that
the
defense
counsel
said,
well
didn't
you
say
at
the
first
trial
that
you
were
there
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
to
which
he
denied
and
he
said
that
he
was
high
on
narcotic
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial
and
i
might
add
that
pain
relieving
narcotics
drug
because
he
did
have
a
--
some
difficulty
with
his
leg.
now,
then
the
court
questioned
him
about
this.
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
had
some
difficulty
with
his
leg
your
honor
and
he
maintained
that
he
was
taking
the
narcotics
drug
for
the
pain
in
his
leg.
his
leg
subsequently
was
amputated
so
he
apparently
did
have
a
problem,
but
we
--
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
court
then
questioned
him
whether
--
about
this
evasive
matter
of
whether
he
remembered
committing
the
crime
or
not
and
he
was
very
vague
about
the
party
the
night
before
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
sentencing
judge
had
to
decide
what
sentence
should
mr.
moon
receive.
it
is
on
the
basis
of
his
record,
his
record
did
come
in,
he
had
been
convicted
previously
on
two
or
three
offenses.
in
the
trial
itself,
the
evidence,
it
was
an
atrocious
crime
and
then
plus
the
fact
that
after
two
years
in
prison,
mr.
moon
has
not
indicated
any
rehabilitative
signs
at
all.
he
denies
his
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
i'm
characterizing
it,
but
it's
indicated
by
the
fact
that
he
denied
committing
the
crime
when
he
is
on
questioning
as
to
sentencing
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
in
the
second
trial
but
as
to
the
first
trial
there
is
a
judicial
confession.
and
incidentally,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
record
indicates
this,
the
state
sought
to
put
the
judicial
confession
in
and
the
trial
judge
refused
to
allow
the
state
to
put
the
judicial
confession
in
and
so
it
was
excluded.
now,
so
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
there
was
a
plea
on
both
crimes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
was
both
crimes
not
guilty,
jury
trials,
both
of
them
lasted
two
days.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
to
make
the
record
clear.
the
only
sentence
that
mr.
moon
appealed
was
the
armed
robbery.
he
did
not
appeal
the
other
two
sentences.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
in
the
first
case,
there
was
a
charge
of
larceny.
this
is
the
benton
situation,
no
two
ways
about
that.
in
the
first
trial,
the
sixth
count
was
larceny.
but
for
some
reason
in
reading
the
record,
the
court
and
the
counsel
got
it
mixed
up
and
they
called
it
a
receiving
stolen
goods
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
what
are
you
going
to
do,
there
is
no
evidence
of
receiving
stolen
goods,”
so
the
state
said,
“we'll
abandon
the
larceny
count.”
so
there
was
a
larceny
count
in
the
first
trial
and
it
was
abandoned
after
the
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
sir,
it
was
abandoned
by
the
state.
so
in
effect,
it
would
be
found
--
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
we
would
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
the
second
trial
was
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
now
this
count
or
this
indictment
was
not
brought
at
the
first
trail
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
first
time
you
had
a
--
armed
robbery
count
--
charge
with
three
additional
or
four,
at
least
five
additional
counts
which
one
included
larceny,
and
the
second
indictment
which
was
not
present
at
the
first
trial,
but
at
the
second
was
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
and
this
is
what
judge
pugh
is
referring
to
that
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
was
not
present
at
the
first
trial,
but
he
was
tried
on
that
the
second
time.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
plus
the
fact
that
the
crime
is
more
vividly
described
in
the
second
trial
rather
than
the
first.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
oh!
now,
i
would
like
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
not
on
the
record.
we
--
the
trial
judge,
this
case
was
tried
six
--
three
years
prior
to
pearce
and
it
is
not
spread
on
the
record
these
reasons
you
understand
that
and
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
anybody
that
it
is
not.
but
this
is
identifiable
conduct
if
we
are
looking
forward
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
would
argue
that
your
honor
plus
the
fact
that
this
distinguishing
factor
between
this
case
and
pearce
is
that
in
pearce
and
simpson,
both
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
one
judge
johnson
in
the
simpson
versus
wright
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
felt
that
mr.
wright
i
believe
it
was
with
a
vindictively
sentence
and
he
was
penalized
for
taking
an
appeal.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
oh
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
i
--
you
could
term
it
at
intervening
event
but
that
i
don't
think
that
could
be
construed
to
--
for
the
--
why
the
sentence
was
increased,
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
from
that
face,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
that's
how
we
view
it
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
think
your
honor
on
the
retroactive
problem,
we
have
to
be
talking
of
moon
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
they
--
excuse
me.
the
state
abandoned
the
larceny
count
before
it
went
to
the
jury.so
it
was
not
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
armed
robbery
alone.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir,
that
was
a
new
indictment
and
different
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
all
you're
concerned
with
because
that's
the
only
one
that
was
appealed.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
think
that
pearce,
the
due
procedure
rule
in
pearce
was
predicated
on
vindictiveness
of
a
second
court
to
sentence
someone
for
taking
an
appeal.
in
this
case,
had
no
time
has
the
defendant
moon
maintained
that
he
was
--
or
his
sentence
was
increased
because
the
judge
vindictively
increased
his
sentence
because
he
thought
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
so
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
would
be
one
of
our
argument.
of
course
we
also
argue
on
the
retroactivity
of
pearce.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor
i
understand
that
as
far
as
credit
for
time
served
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
it
is
--
that
there
is
a
footnote
to
the
effect
that
it
is
retroactive,
but
we
do
not
have
this
problem.
this
man
not
only
got
217
extra
days
because
his
sentence
was
sent
back
and
he
got
good
time
for
that
and
there
is
a
footnote
that
he
has
to
get
good
time.
he
also
--
the
correctional
system
of
maryland
gave
him
86
days
good
time
for
the
abortive
time
he
spent
-
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
just
was
giving
you
the
whole
picture
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
now,
the
distinguishing
feature
as
i've
indicated
in
this
--
in
the
case
at
bar
is
that
as
to
pearce
and
simpson
is
that
in
pearce
and
simpson,
the
court
found
that
the
sentence
of
what
the
second
trial
was
vindictively
given.
the
man
was
being
penalized
for
taking
an
appeal.
here,
as
i
have
indicated,
one,
the
defendant
moon
has
never
alleged
that.
all
the
--
in
the
3-year
journey
to
this
court,
he
has
never
alleged
that.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
went
into
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
this
as
a
fact
and
this
is
recorded
of
course
in
their
decision
that
there
was
no
indication
that
the
trial
judge
increased
moon
sentence
because
he
had
elected
to
have
a
new
trial
or
for
any
other
unworthy
or
improper
motive.
now,
the
question
as
--
moving
on
to
the
question
of
retroactivity,
the
only
thing
that
possibly
the
retroactivity
appears
is
to
this
particular
case
would
be
the
procedural
rule
which
was
enunciated
by
the
court.
now
whenever
a
judge
impose
a
more
severe
sentence
upon
the
defendant
after
his
new
trial,
the
reason
must
be
affirmative
--
affirmatively
appealed.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
and
that
is
i
would
say,
yes
it
should
have
been
always
the
rule
because
if
somebody
vindictively
did
increase
the
sentence,
certainly
it
can't
be
due
process.
and
i
have
indicated
that
maryland
has
followed
the
similar
rule
they
used
the
term
long
before
they
voted
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
since
1896.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
as
far
as
the
vindictiveness
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
but
now
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
well
now
i
don't
think
that
the
rule,
well,
of
course
if
someone
is
vindictive
in
giving
the
sentence
that
would
violate
the
constitutional
principle
but
i
think
that
we
have
a
similar
situation
here
as
to
the
mccarthy
rule.
that
the
rule
is
to
prevent
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
principle
and
this
is
the
rule
in
pearce
as
i
view
it
is
to
prevent
a
violation
to
with
here
of
giving
an
increased
sentence
for
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--vindictiveness.
now,
i
would
maintain
that
since
--
that
the
rule
itself
should
not
be
retroactive
and
citing
the
but
--
now
my
time
is
running
out,
but
citing
the
three
purposes
that
this
court
has
used
to
measure
retroactivity
that
certainly
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
purpose.
the
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
making
it
a
retroactive
because
it
is
to
ensure
that
every
defendant
it
was
given
a
harsher
sentence
on
retrial
is
not
given
that
sentence
out
of
vindictiveness
and
were
to
alleviate
the
fear
of
vindictiveness
and
its
chilling
effect
by
spreading
it
on
the
record
so
that
the
appellate
judge
or
a
reviewing
court
can
see
that.
now,
you
cannot
say
and
i
quote
with
our
statistics
would
indicate
that
all
persons
that
received
additional
time
did
not
receive
that
out
of
vindictiveness
and
that
the
evil
sought
to
be
remedied
by
the
new
procedural
rules
herein,
does
not
per
se
exist
in
every
case.
plus
the
fact
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
remedy
still
under
collateral
proceedings,
post
conviction
and/or
habeas
corpus
on
it,
although
admitted
difficult
to
prove.
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
question
of
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
a
court
did
not
have
to
set
forth
the
reasons
would
be
based
in
stroud
versus
united
states
and
also
in
our
own
state
on
hoves
versus
maryland
and
the
mitchell
case.
i
--
we
do
present
some
problems
as
to
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
exactly
how
that
this
rule
is
applied
retroactively,
how
is
the
procedure
going
to
be
setup,
is
--
that
the
new
judge
give
a
sentence
based
on
the
record
or
the
transcript?
does
he
just
assume
the
old
sentence
which
this
court
has
held
that
has
been
nullified
and
it
presents
a
great
many,
the
problems
that
must
be
faced
and
it
could
best
be
left
unanswered
by
making
it
the
rule
itself
prospectively
rather
than
--
and
prospectively
from
june
23,
1969,
the
date
of
the
pearce
decision,
thank
you.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
was
after
it
was
granted,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
june
--
oh,
i
think
it
was
granted
the
day
that
you
decided
benton,
benton
versus
maryland,
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
oh
no
sir
and
i
requested
that
because
of
what
i
consider
the
directive
in
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
after
i've
read
the
pearce
case,
i
thought
it
would
be
best
that
the
court
have
that
information.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that.
i
think
that
that
affidavit
should
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
rule
and
the
pearce
case
then.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
only
to
the
facts
or
reasons
why
the
court
sentenced
this
man
to
this
particular
sentence.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well
i
--
that
could
be
easy
answer,
would
be
say
yes
but
i
quite
honestly
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but
yes
sir
arguable.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir,
it
could
be
arguable,
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
i
would
argue
that.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
accommodate
my
brother
and
inform
him
while
he
made
the
statement
that
he
does
no
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals,
maybe
he
was
limited
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland.
but
as
far
as
the
court
of
special
appeals
which
is
an
appellate
court,
they
did
reverse
the
reeves
case
simply
because
they'd
felt
that
the
trial
judge
exceeded
his
authority
and
it
possibly
foreshadowed
this
court's
decision
in
as
far
as
credit
for
time
served.
i
think
the
pearce
case
held
that
while
the
sentence
is
a
nullity
on
the
first
conviction,
the
time
actually
served
cannot
be
a
nullity,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
the
special
appeals
held
not
in
those
exact
terms,
but
in
that
case
since
reeves
had
been
given
a
life
sentence,
he
had
spent
6
years
in
prison.
the
second
time
around,
when
it
was
reversed
in
the
federal
court,
he
received
a
20
year
sentence,
it
was
a
crime
of
rape
and
the
judge
gave
him
20
years
but
did
not
take
in
to
consideration
the
fact
that
mr.
reeves
had
actually
spent
6
years
in
jail.
and
so
therefore,
the
court
of
special
appeals
held
that
this
was
in
effect
increase
in
the
statutory
sentence
of
20
years
that
reeves
was
entitled
to
and
they
reversed
the
case
and
our
court
of
appeals
for
their
own
reasons
did
not
grant
cert.
the
state,
mr.
jacques
is
correct,
the
state
took
a
cert
in
that
case
insofar
as
we
were
trying
to
resolve
the
question
of
moon
which
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time,
reeves
and
also
another
case,
williams
versus
state
dealing
with
jail
time,
that
is
the
time
a
defendant
spends
in
jail
pending
the
trial
as
differentiated
from
sentence
time.
now,
as
to
the
statistics
that
we
quote
on
page
38,
had
no
time
to
mean
to
infer
that
this
11
increased
sentence
applies
to
all
retrials
in
the
state
of
maryland.
this
is
limited
as
indicated
in
the
brief
only
to
schowgurow
cases,
not
to
cases
that
have
been
reversed
because
of
double
jeopardy
problems,
evidentiary
problems
and
a
variety
of
reversals
that
come
through.
this
is
only
limited
and
it
was
only
entered
into
the
statistics
of
finding
out
this
to
contradict
this
philosophy,
this
pragmatic
philosophy
that
judges
on
the
second
trial
will
vindictively,
systematically
is
the
word
that's
used
in
the
law
review
article
that
is
duke
law
journal
systematically
would
increase
sentence.
this
would
indicate
that
in
maryland
on
the
schowgurow
that
out
of
the
85
cases
that
we
were
able
to
come
up
with
retrials,
61
got
it
a
decrease
in
sentence,
that's
72%.
now
and
incidentally,
this
was
not
a
figure
on
the
sentence
itself
because
that's
only
one
consideration
determined
whether
he
may
and
got
a
decrease
in
sentence,
you
must
determine
the
date
of
his
first
sentence
to
make
sure
that
the
second
sentence
covers
that
same
period
of
time
and
this
was
figured
on
that
basis.
someone
could
get
a
lesser
sentence
but
in
effect
served
more
time,
if
he
did
not
get
credit
for
the
time
served.
now,
i
think
that
the
question
here
in
view
of
the
pearce
decision
by
this
honorable
court,
the
question
before
us
today
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
pearce
court
held
that
on
a
retrial,
a
man
can
get
a
heavier
sentence.
the
main
fear
--
there
was
two
problems
there.
one
was
credit
for
time
served.
the
other
was
the
fear
of
the
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
judge.
so
therefore,
i
think
it's
incumbent
to
question
before
this
court
today.
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
the
trial
record
of
the
second
trial
would
support
the
fact
that
judge
pugh,
sentencing
judge
had
ample
reasons
or
was
his
sentence,
not
necessarily
just
a
file,
or
that
could
be
a
question
of
debate
but
whether
it
was
given
in
conformity
with
the
evidence
of
that
particular
case.
and
certainly,
it
has
been
the
law
in
maryland
at
all
times
since
1896
in
the
mitchell
case
that
if
a
judge
sentenced
for
an
improper
motive,
death
sentence
should
be
set
aside.
we
would
say
that
a
vindictive
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
judge
in
penalizing
the
man
for
taking
an
appeal
is
certainly
an
unworthy
to
note
and
it
should
be
set
aside.
now,
i
would
--
well,
no
question
has
been
raised
as
to
the
guilt
of
this
particular
man.
i
think
it's
essential
that
a
factual
outline
of
the
crime
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
this
was
a
prosecution
for
armed
robbery
and
assault
with
intent
to
murder
and
larceny
of
a
female
hardware
clerk
who
was
on
her
way
to
deposit
money
in
the
bank.
this
was
in
broad
daylight
in
the
shopping
center
just
to
the
northwest
of
here
and
as
she
was
walking
to
that
bank,
she
was
attacked
by
the
defendant
moon.
the
evidence
will
indicate
that
he
struck
her
and
beat
her
to
the
ground
with
a
lead
pipe
that
he
had
fashioned
the
night
before
by
putting
tar
tape
around
it.
he
was
a
former
coworker
of
the
victim.
he
knew
the
victim,
the
victim
knew
him.
so
it
was
essential
to
this
operation
of
this
crime
that
she
could
not
be
able
to
identify
him.
and
that's
exactly
he
was
successful
because
the
beating
was
so
severe
that
this
woman
could
not
identify
moon
at
the
first
trial
and
could
not
identify
him
at
the
second
trial
two
years
later
because
she
was
suffering
from
amnesia
brought
on
by
this
brutal
beating
about
the
head.
now,
so
the
first
trial,
the
judge
at
the
first
trial
had
before
him
the
following.
he
had
a
witness
to
the
peer,
this
victim
who
said
that
she
couldn't
remember
any
of
the
details.
this
was
six
months
after
the
crime.
she
had
lost
her
memory
and
she
couldn't
--
all
she
could
tell
him
was
the
name
of
her
physicians.
the
blackout
on
this
young
lady
was
from
five-day
period,
the
day
before
to
a
mere
four
days
thereafter
the
crime.
she
couldn't
remember
or
give
any
details,
so
the
first
trial
was
limited
to
a
description
of
her
injury
by
people
that
found
her
laying
on
the
sidewalk.
in
addition,
after
the
evidence,
it
was
a
jury
trial,
it
took
two
days.
the
defendant
when
he
was
called
or
took
the
stand
in
his
own
behalf,
he
admitted
--
he
admitted
that
he
made
the
weapon.
he
also
admitted
that
he
was
there
at
the
shopping
center.
he
admitted
striking
the
lady.
in
reading
the
record,
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion,
there
is
a
tone
of
remorse
and
regret
that
as
he
stated
this
and
that
he
was
sorry
that
he
hurt
her,
that
he
liked
her
and
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
her.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir
and
the
point
of
bringing
this
out
is
to
the
difference
in
sentence,
all
judges
vary
well
not
all,
but
there
is
a
despairing
sentencing
and
it's
unfortunate
but
as
long
as
we
have
human
beings
to
sentence
people
rather
than
computers,
we
are
going
to
have
disparity
of
sentences.
now,
so
mr.
moon
was
convicted
and
got
12
years
and
as
mr.
jacques
has
indicated,
he
recited
the
chronological
order
that
it
was
reversed
because
of
schowgurow.
now,
what
took
place
at
the
second
trial?
the
second
trial,
two
years
later,
the
woman
comes
in
and
she
testifies
again
and
she
is
--
has
continued
to
have
amnesia
as
to
this
five-day
period.
she
testified
that
she
is
still
under
the
doctor's
care.
two
years
later,
still
under
medical
care,
at
this
trial,
the
doctor
appears
and
he
testifies
as
to
the
medical
description
of
the
terms
that
she
was
suffering
among
other
things,
a
cerebral
concussion.
at
this
time,
it
was
a
jury
trial
that
took
two
days
incidentally
and
at
this
time,
moon
did
not
take
the
stand,
that's
what
his
privilege.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
judge
or
the
jury
rather
found
him
guilty,
guilty
of
--
it's
very
true,
guilty
of
armed
robbery,
guilty
of
larceny
and
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
was
not
brought
at
the
first
trial.
now,
when
the
--
moon
was
asked
by
the
court,
"would
you
--
do
you
have
anything
you
would
like
to
say
before
i
enter
sentence?"
he
was
also
asked
or
the
court
asked
defense
counsel
whether
they
want
a
pre-sentence
report
and
that
was
turned
down
and
they
wanted
sentence
there.
moon
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
as
to
why
the
court
should
be
lenient
was
because
he
did
not
commit
the
crime.
he
was
not
there
and
he
denied
hitting
the
woman.
the
court
wasn't
--
should
grin
at
this,
it
didn't
know.
the
defense
counsel
if
you
read
the
record,
will
indicate
that
the
defense
counsel
said,
well
didn't
you
say
at
the
first
trial
that
you
were
there
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
to
which
he
denied
and
he
said
that
he
was
high
on
narcotic
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial
and
i
might
add
that
pain
relieving
narcotics
drug
because
he
did
have
a
--
some
difficulty
with
his
leg.
now,
then
the
court
questioned
him
about
this.
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
had
some
difficulty
with
his
leg
your
honor
and
he
maintained
that
he
was
taking
the
narcotics
drug
for
the
pain
in
his
leg.
his
leg
subsequently
was
amputated
so
he
apparently
did
have
a
problem,
but
we
--
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
court
then
questioned
him
whether
--
about
this
evasive
matter
of
whether
he
remembered
committing
the
crime
or
not
and
he
was
very
vague
about
the
party
the
night
before
and
so
forth.
now,
it
is
on
that
basis
that
the
sentencing
judge
had
to
decide
what
sentence
should
mr.
moon
receive.
it
is
on
the
basis
of
his
record,
his
record
did
come
in,
he
had
been
convicted
previously
on
two
or
three
offenses.
in
the
trial
itself,
the
evidence,
it
was
an
atrocious
crime
and
then
plus
the
fact
that
after
two
years
in
prison,
mr.
moon
has
not
indicated
any
rehabilitative
signs
at
all.
he
denies
his
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
i'm
characterizing
it,
but
it's
indicated
by
the
fact
that
he
denied
committing
the
crime
when
he
is
on
questioning
as
to
sentencing
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
in
the
second
trial
but
as
to
the
first
trial
there
is
a
judicial
confession.
and
incidentally,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
record
indicates
this,
the
state
sought
to
put
the
judicial
confession
in
and
the
trial
judge
refused
to
allow
the
state
to
put
the
judicial
confession
in
and
so
it
was
excluded.
now,
so
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
there
was
a
plea
on
both
crimes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
was
both
crimes
not
guilty,
jury
trials,
both
of
them
lasted
two
days.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
to
make
the
record
clear.
the
only
sentence
that
mr.
moon
appealed
was
the
armed
robbery.
he
did
not
appeal
the
other
two
sentences.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
in
the
first
case,
there
was
a
charge
of
larceny.
this
is
the
benton
situation,
no
two
ways
about
that.
in
the
first
trial,
the
sixth
count
was
larceny.
but
for
some
reason
in
reading
the
record,
the
court
and
the
counsel
got
it
mixed
up
and
they
called
it
a
receiving
stolen
goods
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
what
are
you
going
to
do,
there
is
no
evidence
of
receiving
stolen
goods,”
so
the
state
said,
“we'll
abandon
the
larceny
count.”
so
there
was
a
larceny
count
in
the
first
trial
and
it
was
abandoned
after
the
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
sir,
it
was
abandoned
by
the
state.
so
in
effect,
it
would
be
found
--
it
would
be
double
jeopardy
we
would
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
the
second
trial
was
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
now
this
count
or
this
indictment
was
not
brought
at
the
first
trail
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
first
time
you
had
a
--
armed
robbery
count
--
charge
with
three
additional
or
four,
at
least
five
additional
counts
which
one
included
larceny,
and
the
second
indictment
which
was
not
present
at
the
first
trial,
but
at
the
second
was
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
and
this
is
what
judge
pugh
is
referring
to
that
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
was
not
present
at
the
first
trial,
but
he
was
tried
on
that
the
second
time.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
plus
the
fact
that
the
crime
is
more
vividly
described
in
the
second
trial
rather
than
the
first.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
oh!
now,
i
would
like
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
not
on
the
record.
we
--
the
trial
judge,
this
case
was
tried
six
--
three
years
prior
to
pearce
and
it
is
not
spread
on
the
record
these
reasons
you
understand
that
and
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
anybody
that
it
is
not.
but
this
is
identifiable
conduct
if
we
are
looking
forward
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
would
argue
that
your
honor
plus
the
fact
that
this
distinguishing
factor
between
this
case
and
pearce
is
that
in
pearce
and
simpson,
both
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
one
judge
johnson
in
the
simpson
versus
wright
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
felt
that
mr.
wright
i
believe
it
was
with
a
vindictively
sentence
and
he
was
penalized
for
taking
an
appeal.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
oh
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
i
--
you
could
term
it
at
intervening
event
but
that
i
don't
think
that
could
be
construed
to
--
for
the
--
why
the
sentence
was
increased,
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
from
that
face,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
that's
how
we
view
it
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
think
your
honor
on
the
retroactive
problem,
we
have
to
be
talking
of
moon
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
they
--
excuse
me.
the
state
abandoned
the
larceny
count
before
it
went
to
the
jury.so
it
was
not
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
armed
robbery
alone.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir,
that
was
a
new
indictment
and
different
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
all
you're
concerned
with
because
that's
the
only
one
that
was
appealed.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
think
that
pearce,
the
due
procedure
rule
in
pearce
was
predicated
on
vindictiveness
of
a
second
court
to
sentence
someone
for
taking
an
appeal.
in
this
case,
had
no
time
has
the
defendant
moon
maintained
that
he
was
--
or
his
sentence
was
increased
because
the
judge
vindictively
increased
his
sentence
because
he
thought
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
so
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
would
be
one
of
our
argument.
of
course
we
also
argue
on
the
retroactivity
of
pearce.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor
i
understand
that
as
far
as
credit
for
time
served
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
it
is
--
that
there
is
a
footnote
to
the
effect
that
it
is
retroactive,
but
we
do
not
have
this
problem.
this
man
not
only
got
217
extra
days
because
his
sentence
was
sent
back
and
he
got
good
time
for
that
and
there
is
a
footnote
that
he
has
to
get
good
time.
he
also
--
the
correctional
system
of
maryland
gave
him
86
days
good
time
for
the
abortive
time
he
spent
-
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
just
was
giving
you
the
whole
picture
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
now,
the
distinguishing
feature
as
i've
indicated
in
this
--
in
the
case
at
bar
is
that
as
to
pearce
and
simpson
is
that
in
pearce
and
simpson,
the
court
found
that
the
sentence
of
what
the
second
trial
was
vindictively
given.
the
man
was
being
penalized
for
taking
an
appeal.
here,
as
i
have
indicated,
one,
the
defendant
moon
has
never
alleged
that.
all
the
--
in
the
3-year
journey
to
this
court,
he
has
never
alleged
that.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
went
into
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
found
this
as
a
fact
and
this
is
recorded
of
course
in
their
decision
that
there
was
no
indication
that
the
trial
judge
increased
moon
sentence
because
he
had
elected
to
have
a
new
trial
or
for
any
other
unworthy
or
improper
motive.
now,
the
question
as
--
moving
on
to
the
question
of
retroactivity,
the
only
thing
that
possibly
the
retroactivity
appears
is
to
this
particular
case
would
be
the
procedural
rule
which
was
enunciated
by
the
court.
now
whenever
a
judge
impose
a
more
severe
sentence
upon
the
defendant
after
his
new
trial,
the
reason
must
be
affirmative
--
affirmatively
appealed.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
and
that
is
i
would
say,
yes
it
should
have
been
always
the
rule
because
if
somebody
vindictively
did
increase
the
sentence,
certainly
it
can't
be
due
process.
and
i
have
indicated
that
maryland
has
followed
the
similar
rule
they
used
the
term
long
before
they
voted
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
since
1896.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
as
far
as
the
vindictiveness
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
but
now
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
well
now
i
don't
think
that
the
rule,
well,
of
course
if
someone
is
vindictive
in
giving
the
sentence
that
would
violate
the
constitutional
principle
but
i
think
that
we
have
a
similar
situation
here
as
to
the
mccarthy
rule.
that
the
rule
is
to
prevent
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
principle
and
this
is
the
rule
in
pearce
as
i
view
it
is
to
prevent
a
violation
to
with
here
of
giving
an
increased
sentence
for
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--vindictiveness.
now,
i
would
maintain
that
since
--
that
the
rule
itself
should
not
be
retroactive
and
citing
the
but
--
now
my
time
is
running
out,
but
citing
the
three
purposes
that
this
court
has
used
to
measure
retroactivity
that
certainly
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
purpose.
the
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
making
it
a
retroactive
because
it
is
to
ensure
that
every
defendant
it
was
given
a
harsher
sentence
on
retrial
is
not
given
that
sentence
out
of
vindictiveness
and
were
to
alleviate
the
fear
of
vindictiveness
and
its
chilling
effect
by
spreading
it
on
the
record
so
that
the
appellate
judge
or
a
reviewing
court
can
see
that.
now,
you
cannot
say
and
i
quote
with
our
statistics
would
indicate
that
all
persons
that
received
additional
time
did
not
receive
that
out
of
vindictiveness
and
that
the
evil
sought
to
be
remedied
by
the
new
procedural
rules
herein,
does
not
per
se
exist
in
every
case.
plus
the
fact
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
remedy
still
under
collateral
proceedings,
post
conviction
and/or
habeas
corpus
on
it,
although
admitted
difficult
to
prove.
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
question
of
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
a
court
did
not
have
to
set
forth
the
reasons
would
be
based
in
stroud
versus
united
states
and
also
in
our
own
state
on
hoves
versus
maryland
and
the
mitchell
case.
i
--
we
do
present
some
problems
as
to
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
exactly
how
that
this
rule
is
applied
retroactively,
how
is
the
procedure
going
to
be
setup,
is
--
that
the
new
judge
give
a
sentence
based
on
the
record
or
the
transcript?
does
he
just
assume
the
old
sentence
which
this
court
has
held
that
has
been
nullified
and
it
presents
a
great
many,
the
problems
that
must
be
faced
and
it
could
best
be
left
unanswered
by
making
it
the
rule
itself
prospectively
rather
than
--
and
prospectively
from
june
23,
1969,
the
date
of
the
pearce
decision,
thank
you.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
was
after
it
was
granted,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
june
--
oh,
i
think
it
was
granted
the
day
that
you
decided
benton,
benton
versus
maryland,
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
oh
no
sir
and
i
requested
that
because
of
what
i
consider
the
directive
in
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes.
after
i've
read
the
pearce
case,
i
thought
it
would
be
best
that
the
court
have
that
information.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that.
i
think
that
that
affidavit
should
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
rule
and
the
pearce
case
then.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
only
to
the
facts
or
reasons
why
the
court
sentenced
this
man
to
this
particular
sentence.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well
i
--
that
could
be
easy
answer,
would
be
say
yes
but
i
quite
honestly
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but
yes
sir
arguable.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir,
it
could
be
arguable,
absolutely.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
i
would
argue
that.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes
sir.
thank
you.
