justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
i
get
--
understand
this
clearly.
are
we
talking
about
anything
more
than
the
increased
sentence
on
the
conviction
for
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it,
are
we
concerned
here
--
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
tried
the
first
time
and
convicted
of
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
also
convicted
of
larceny,
but
the
state
abandoned
that
conviction
for
further
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
but
he
got
--
so
he
was
sentenced--
he
got
the
12-year
sentence
for
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
when
he
got
to
new
trial,
he
got
--
he
was
convicted
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
convicted
for
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
convicted
for
larceny?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
are
we
concerned
with
anything
here
except
the
increased
sentence
on
the
armed
robbery
conviction,
that's
i'm
trying
to
get
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
why
is
it
you
are
suggesting
that
pearce
is
not
applicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
not
an
argument
that
pearce
is
inapplicable
because
it
ought
to
be
prospective
only?
this
is
an
argument
that
pearce
is
inapplicable
because
there
is
no
element
here
of
vindictiveness
on
the
second
--
on
the
imposition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
second
armed
robbery
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you're
telling
us
all
about
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
conviction
at
the
second
trial
and
with
the
larceny
conviction
at
the
second
trial.
what
relevance
have
they
to
the
issue
that
we've
got
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.
