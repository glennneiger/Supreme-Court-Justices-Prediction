mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
robert
anthony
jacques,
attorney
for
petitioner
number
267.
i
believe
a
brief
statement
of
the
chronology
of
events
would
be
in
order
before
we
start
the
issues
presented
to
me
by
the
court
in
this
case
under
the
instructions
of
last
june
23.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
dennis
mullene
moon
was
arrested
on
june
2,
1964
and
was
tried
on
december
17,
1964,
convicted
on
january
7,
1965
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
in
the
circuit
court
for
montgomery
county,
maryland.
on
october
23,
1965,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
decided
schowgurow
versus
state
of
maryland
and
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
they
held
it
limitedly
retroactive
to
include
petitioner
in
these
proceedings
and
invited
or
said
that
he
could
avail
himself
of
that
decision
and
take
a
new
trial
if
he
so
desire
since
his
conviction
had
not
yet
been
made
final.
he
in
effect
did
take
a
new
trial
on
june
6,
1966,
and
on
june
7,
1966,
was
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
assault
with
intent
to
murder
and
larceny.
it
is
the
irony
of
this
case
that
the
second
judge
chose
to
increase
the
sentence
for
the
same
charge
for
which
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
in
both
cases,
that
is
armed
robbery
and
then
imposed
to
suspend
it,
concurrent
10-year
sentences
on
the
other
charge.
i
say
in
all
frankness
that
had
not
judge
--
had
judge
pugh
run
the
other
sentences
consecutively
and
left
the
sentence
for
armed
robbery
at
12
years,
i
would
not
be
standing
here
today,
i
would
really
have
no
case
at
all.
be
that
as
it
may,
judge
pugh
did
see
fit
to
increase
the
sentence
on
the
identical
charge
for
which
the
petitioner
had
received
12-years
to
20-years
at
his
second
trial.
this
court,
when
it
granted
certiorari
last
june,
ordered
me
to
argue
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
and
it
is
the
--
actually
judge
pugh
gave
the
petitioner
more
credit
than
he
had
received
at
his
first
trial.
judge
pugh
run
the
sentence
back
to
the
date
of
his
arrest
whereas
the
first
judge
run
it
back
to
the
date
of
his
first
sentence
only.
so
in
effect,
judge
pugh
gave
him
another
seven
months
credit
for
time.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
there's
no
question
of
credit.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
full
credit
was
given,
that's
correct.
if
i
may
proceed
your
honor
as
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
i
believe
as
a
practical
matter
that
--
may
i
state
at
the
outset
that
i
am
not
urging
the
court
as
a
practical
matter
that
every
decision
of
this
court
should
be
made
retroactive
and
i'm
not
here
to
push
that
argument.
my
argument
of
course
is
only
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
criteria
which
this
court
has
outlined,
particularly
in
stovall
versus
denno,
desist
versus
united
states
that
the
three
criteria
of
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule,
reliance
on
the
old
rule
and
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice
fully
justify
a
completely
retroactive
effect
to
this
case
before
the
court
today,
that
is
moon.
i
would
like
to
say
further
your
honor
that
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
in
effect
a
new
rule
so
that
the
question
of
retroactivity
i
believe
is
at
least
--
that
this
is
not
a
retroactive
case
in
effect.
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
north
carolina
versus
pearce
was
a
case
of
first
impression
to
this
court
and
i
intend
to
argue
it
later
to
that
effect
that
it
is
not
in
any
change
in
the
law
of
the
united
states.
it
certainly
in
the
petitioner's
opinion
is
not
a
change
in
the
laws
expounded
by
united
states
versus
ball
or
stroud
versus
united
states,
but
was
a
new
case.
i
would
also
state
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
three
criteria
stated
for
instance,
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it
is
to
allow
a
free
and
uninhibited
right
to
appellate
review
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
of
the
united
states.
certainly,
this
purpose
and
the
court
has
so
stated
in
stovall
i
believe
that
this
purpose
is
controlling
unless
the
questions
of
reliance
or
burden
are
such
as
to
overcome
it.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
those
factors
are
not
of
such
a
factor.
i
would
say
this
as
to
reliance
that
the
court
in
benton
for
instance
talked
about
collateral
estoppel.
now
the
state
may
have
--
i
would
say
first
the
state
had
no
old
rule
to
rely
on
and
i
will
approach
that
in
later.
since
they
had
no
right
rule
to
rely
on,
even
if
they
did
rely
on
the
maryland
law,
and
of
course
they
would
argue
that,
there
was
no
controlling
united
states
case
with
them
to
rely
on
and
assuming
that
there
were
under
the
doctrine
of
estoppel,
they
did
not
change
their
position
to
their
detriment
because
of
this
decision.
and
if
the
court
will
note
at
page
38
of
the
state's
brief,
they
concede
that
of
the
85
persons
retried
who
that
is,
were
reconvicted
under
schowgurow,
11
of
them
received
increased
sentences.
now,
projecting
as
a
practical
matter,
maryland's
population
is
4%
of
the
national
population,
that
would
mean
approximately
550
prisoners
in
the
state
prisons
in
this
country
who
would
be
re-sentenced.
i
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
mr.
chief
justice,
schowgurow
was
decided
on
october
of
1965.
the
state's
brief
was
submitted
in
approximately
september
of
1969,
that's
four
years.
i
don't
see
--
there
were
i
believe,
221
cases.
the
state
has
some
figures
which
they
put
in
their
brief,
but
i
don't
see
frankly
where
that
the
figures
will
change
with
time
at
all.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh,
very
frankly,
i
will
concede
that
i
borrowed
a
copy
of
the
brief
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
petitioner
for
respondent
there
stated
that
perhaps
up
to
70%
of
some
cases
in
north
carolina
had
received
increased
sentences.
so
perhaps
my
figures
are
at
least
subject
to
challenge,
but
i
submit
that
the
number
of
cases
involved
in
the
state
courts
cannot
be
that
great
and
in
particular,
the
burden
on
any
one
state
is
to
justify
the
reliance
on
a
rule
which
might
been
your
honor
does
not
exist
in
the
first
place.
and
if
i
may
talk
about
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
but
no
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that.
i
know
in
maryland
courts
and
i
believe
the
maryland
court
in
my
case
relied
very
heavily
on
stroud
versus
united
states
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
increase
of
sentence
at
retrial.
i
do
not
so
read
stroud
nor
do
i
read
united
states
versus
ball.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i
read
pearce
and
simpson
to
have
approached
the
prohibition
against
increase
of
sentence
with
the
exception
which
the
court
outlined
as
to
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trials.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
it
said
--
that's
correct,
they
said
--
well
as
i
recall,
there
was
no
flat
absolute
prohibition.
i
agree
with
the
court
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
--
to
that
extent,
but
the
point
that
i
originally
urged
in
my
writ
of
certiorari,
that
is
point
three
of
this
argument,
that
is
the
that
prohibition
in
fact
be
made
a
flat
prohibition
under
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
pearce
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
i
hate
to
say
it
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i'm
saying
that
the
court
did
not
go
far
enough
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
yes.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
as
to
the
question
of
and
perhaps
as
to
this
question
of
reliance,
i
know
that
the
court
stated
at
some
length
in
pearce
that
they
did
not
wish
to
overrule
the
long
line
of
cases
involved
in
stroud.
but
as
i
read
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
there,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
stand
for
the
proposition
which
the
court
feels
it
does
or
at
least
the
plurality
opinion
in
pearce
says
that
it
does.
i
have
read
the
briefs
in
the
stroud
case
and
counsel
was
arguing
there
and
as
it's
in
my
brief,
that
since
stroud
had
been
put
in
jeopardy
at
a
former
trial,
he
could
not
even
be
retried
again
for
the
same
offense,
that
is
murder
and
i
believe
--
say
with
respect
to
the
court
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
stroud
case
stands
for
and
i
believe
murphy
versus
massachusetts,
ball
versus
united
states,
all
stand
for
roughly
that
proposition.
that
is
that
the
fact
of
an
acquittal
or
the
fact
of
a
reversal
does
not
in
any
way
prohibit
retrial
for
the
same
offense
and
i'm
certainly
not
saying
that
to
this
court.
that's
an
untenable
argument.
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
until
pearce
had
never
decided
the
question
of
increase
of
sentence
at
retrial.
now,
if
i
may
--
as
to
the
question
of
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
right
your
honor
and
of
course
this
came
--
his
case
came
back
here
ironically
in
1916
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
--
some
4
years
later.
if
i
recall
in
may
of
1916,
he
received
the
death
sentence.
he
then
appealed
and
got
life
the
second
time
and
then
on
the
theory
of
pushing
his
luck
i
suppose,
then
got
a
third
trial.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
and
got
death
again
and
it
was
in
that
case
that
his
counsel
urged
that
since
he'd
already
put
in
jeopardy
for
his
life,
he
couldn't
be
tried
again
the
third
time
at
all.
and
i've
read
stroud
and
i'm
convinced
that
that's
what
this
court
was
deciding
in
stroud
that
there
was
no
reason
not
to
retry
him
a
third
time.
if
i
may
proceed
then
as
to
the
question
of
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
as
to
double
jeopardy,
i
know
that
this
court
has
in
pearce
decided
that
the
double
jeopardy
argument
is
not
applicable.
may
i
say
respectfully
that
a
close
reading
of
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
of
the
study
since
then
and
in
fact
the
first
draft
of
james
madison's
article
for
the
fifth
amendment
in
which
mr.
madison
stated
that
there
should
be
no
more
than
one
punishment
nor
one
crime,
nor
one
trial
for
the
same
offense.
unfortunately,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
article,
there
was
so
much
confusion
as
to
whether
punishment
mean
they
couldn't
be
retried,
exactly
the
stroud
question
that
mr.
madison
was
forced
to
change
his
original
language.
i
think
very
frankly
your
honor
that
the
language,
the
cases
which
i
feel
are
applicable
to
this
case
are
not
ball
and
not
stroud,
but
ex
parte
lang
in
18
wallace
and
united
states
versus
benz
in
which
this
court
said
in
ex
parte
lang
that
the
reality
of
trial
is
not
the
trial
itself,
but
the
punishment.
and
i
might
say
to
the
court,
i've
only
been
in
practice
of
law
seven
years,
but
i
have
never
had
a
case
in
which
i've
--
in
which
the
overwhelming
desire
and
concern
of
the
prisoner
was
not
the
punishment
involved.
i
know
that
there
maybe
some
cases
where
because
of
security
clearance
or
professional
reputation,
the
conviction
is
the
man
would
do
anything
to
avoid
a
conviction.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
submit
that
in
--
at
least
in
my
experience,
90%
of
the
appeals
that
go
to
the
state
and
federal
appellate
courts
in
this
country
are
in
some
way
related
to
the
issue
of
punishment.
i
think
that
as
the
ultimate
reality
of
criminal
law
and
i
think
very
frankly
to
separate
double
jeopardy
from
trial,
from
double
jeopardy
as
far
as
it
concerns,
the
sentence
is
to
do
--
is
to
incorrectly
judge
in
my
opinion
the
clear
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
says
in
jeopardy
of
--
nor
shall
not
twice
be
put
in
jeopardy
not
by
conviction,
but
of
life
and
limb
that
is
punishment.
and
i
submit
that
--
your
honor
that
the
state
has
raised
several
questions
about,
well,
if
you
extended
it
to
a
flat
prohibition,
what
would
happen?
you'd
have
everybody
appealing.
we
--
i
have
statistics
your
honor
that
show
that
in
some
circuits,
the
rate
of
appeal
is
approaching
90%
now.
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
for
a
crime
involving
of
more
than
one
year
imprisonment,
you
have
two
automatic
reviews,
automatic,
you
don't
even
have
to
request
them.
i
submit
further
that
the
state
is
apparently
been
saying
all
along
that
the
second
trial
judge
sits
de
novo
and
accordingly,
he
has
the
right
to
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
the
first
judge
because
the
first
judgment
has
ceased
to
exist.
if
i
recall
the
language
of
the
court
in
pearce,
is
that
the
first
judgment,
the
first
sentence
insofar
does
not
conserve
becomes
a
nullity.
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
that
this
nullity
argument
simply
is
not
--
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
argument
in
pearce
at
all.
it
cannot
be
made
--
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
argument
in
pearce.
i
cited
for
instance
in
my
brief
and
i
would
very
much
like
the
state
of
maryland
to
answer
this
question.
reeves
versus
state,
3
maryland
appeal
195,
where
the
defendant
had
served
some
six
years
of
a
sentence,
of
20
years
if
i
recall.
he
then
got
a
new
trial
and
got
20
years
in
prison.
now,
the
court
said,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
de
novo
proceeding.
we
agree
the
slate
as
wiped
clean.
we
agree
that
if
the
former
sentence
is
a
nullity,
but
you
still
can't
sentence
a
man
to
26
years
on
a
20-year
maximum
charge.
as
i
said
to
the
court
of
appeals
when
i
argued
this,
i
said
i
defy,
i
didn't
say
i
defy,
i
said
i
would
like
the
court
to
explain
the
distinction
between
its
rationale
in
moon
and
its
rationale
in
reeves.
if
the
former
sentence
is
a
nullity,
then
it
seizes
to
exist
and
if
the
man
gets
another
maximum
sentence,
it's
perfectly
proper.
now,
this
is
the
logical
extension
of
the
reeves
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
declined
to
hear
that
case.
the
state
asked
for
certiorari
and
they
simply
did
not
take
the
case.
and
i
well
say
when
i
was
arguing
the
case,
one
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
said,
he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
man
got
a
de
novo
trial
and
got
another
20
years
and
wound
up
serving
26
years
on
the
20
year
charge,
that
was
perfectly
alright
because
the
former
sentence
was
a
nullity.
i
submit
with
respect
to
the
court
that
you
cannot
consider
a
sentence
as
a
nullity.
it
is
there
and
it
is
why
most
appeals
are
taken.
now,
the
courts
in
the
state
of
maryland,
and
the
maryland
courts
have
said
that
and
they've
cited
from
other
cases
that
on
appeal,
the
trial
judge
--
the
court
of
appeals
will
reverse
a
sentence
if
it
is
excessive
and
they
feel
that
it
violates
liberty
and
due
process.
now,
your
honor,
my
set
of
the
maryland
reports
go
back
to
1682,
i
believe,
that's
the
nominatives
of
maryland
and
they
have
recently
stated
that
there
is
no
case
on
record
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
ever
reduced
a
sentence.
and
in
fact,
i
submit
to
the
court
to
the
best
of
anyone's
knowledge
in
the
entire,
almost
300
years
of
the
appellate
procedure
in
maryland,
not
a
single
case
has
ever
been
reversed
because
the
appellate
court
felt
that
the
trial
judge
had
been
too
harsh.
now
in
fact,
in
the
last
few
years,
the
maryland
legislature
has
seen
fit
to
establish
a
new
procedure
for
appellate
review
sentence
under
rule
762,
the
maryland
rules
of
procedure.
this
involves
a
three-man
bench
of
which
the
sentencing
judge
is
one
and
he
may
then
--
they
may
then
either
increase
the
sentence,
leave
it
alone
or
decrease
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
ultimate
issue.
the
state
of
maryland
has
now
recognized
that
there
is
a
division
between
the
appeal
of
the
trial
and
the
appeal
of
the
sentence.
and
if
we
can
--
i'm
asking
this
court
to
recognize
that
distinction
in
pearce
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
accept
what
i
believe
was
the
logical
extension
of
green
versus
united
states
and
the
very
fine
article
by
professor
ben
olstein
about
this
problem
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief.
and
in
green,
if
we
--
if
the
court
will
accept
the
idea
of
implicit
acquittal
insofar
as
the
trial
goes,
then
i
see
nothing
wrong
and
in
fact
i
think
it's
perfectly
logical
to
say
that
there
has
been
an
implicit
acquittal
insofar
as
any
higher
sentence
goes.
in
other
words,
that
court
has
established
the
maximum
sentence
and
upon
retrial,
while
there
maybe
another
sentence
obviously,
it
cannot
exceed
that
valid
sentence.
i'm
asking
the
court
in
other
words
to
face
what
i
consider
is
the
reality
of
appeals
that
almost
every
appeal
is
a
somehow
an
appeal
of
the
sentence
and
that
because
our
courts
do
not
recognize
that
on
appeal,
somehow
error
has
to
be
found.
i
would
venture
to
this
court
that
if
you
promise
every
prisoner
in
a
--
in
any
jail
in
the
united
states
that
he
would
be
released
if
he
dropped
his
appeal,
i
would
venture
that
90%
of
them
would
drop
the
appeal
immediately.
and
i
would
venture
further
that
if
you
release
them
and
said
you
can
ahead
with
your
appeal,
it
doesn't
matter,
they
still
would
drop
their
appeal
because
we
are
faced
here
and
i
know
this
court
is
facing
other
cases.
we
just
heard
one
about
--
i
think
that
the
sentencing
area
is
the
most
sensitive
area
that
this
court
must
now
resolve.
i
know
that
there
is
a
capital
punishment
case
set.
i
know
north
carolina
versus
alfred
is
set
very
soon,
or
has
been
already
argued.
this,
it
is
now
--
i
think
the
courts,
particularly
this
court
in
pearce
have
finally
faced
this
entire
area
of
sentencing
and
punishment
and
that
is
the
ultimate
reality
of
the
law
of
this
case
and
the
law
of
every
case.
there
is
no
good
reason
not
to
apply
north
carolina
versus
pearce
retroactively.
what
is
going
to
be
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice?
almost
nominal,
not
one
guilty
person
is
going
to
be
turned
lose.
if
every
prisoner
in
the
state
came
under
this
rule
and
i
say
it
is
only
11,
if
every
prisoner
came,
what
would
happen,
he
would
be
brought
back
to
the
sentencing
court
and
sentenced
in
accordance
with
this
case.
i
do
not
consider
that
an
undue
burden.
not
one
person
is
going
to
go
free
because
of
this
case.
as
to
reliance
upon
the
old
rule,
we've
already
discussed
that.
i
submit
very
respectfully,
there
is
no
old
rule.
so
that
is
why
i
contend
that
the
question
of
retroactivity
does
not
even
apply
here.
because
i
know
in
desist
the
court
talked
about
changes
in
the
law
and
a
clear
break
with
the
old
law,
but
there
is
no
old
law
to
break
with
in
this
case.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'm
saving
some
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
all
due
deference
to
my
brother
at
the
bar,
i
frankly
find
his
argument
almost
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court
today.
first
of
all
to
go
immediately
to
the
question
of
vindictiveness,
very
frankly
i
do
not
understand
that
the
pearce
case
is
limited
to
where
the
second
judge
is
being
vindictive.
i
took
it
to
mean
that
this
was
a
means
of
taking
off
any
chilling
effect
on
the
right
of
appeal.
now,
i
have
never
contended
that
judge
pugh
was
vindictive.
i
know
judge
pugh
personally.
i
was
a
law
clerk
in
that
courthouse
and
the
state
has
consistently
been
setting
up
with
all
due
respect
to
saint
thomas
aquinas,
the
straw
man
that
the
vindictiveness
of
the
second
trial
judge
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
appeal.
i
am
saying
to
the
court
that
if
judge
pugh
had
the
highest
motives
in
the
world,
the
ultimate
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
dennis
moon
was
sentenced
to
an
additional
eight-years
imprisonment.
the
motivation,
please
the
court
is
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
absolutely
not
your
honor.
i
do
not
read
it
to
be
restricted
to
vindictive
second
sentencing
judges.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
more
to
know,
but
you're
--
(voice
overlap)
but
your
honor,
i
think
of
reading
the
majority,
plurality
opinion
in
pearce
which
was
based
on
due
process.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
the
court
opinion
which
was
based
as
i
recall
on
due
process.
i
don't
recall
that
the
court
stated
that
it
was
restricted
to
where
there
was
factual
evidence
that
the
second
trial
judge
had
been
vindictive
and
malicious
in
his
sentence.
and
i
think
that
the
state
is
very
cleverly
trying
to
restrict
this
argument
to
that
issue
which
is
i
submit
totally
irrelevant
to
these
proceedings.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
dennis
moon
received
additional
time
in
jail.
he
obviously
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
and
the
issue
then
your
honor
is
that
punishment,
is
that
increased
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
pearce.
i
submit
to
--
since
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
an
increased
punishment
and
i
submit
that
vindictiveness,
malice
are
totally
irrelevant.
it
is
simply
a
different
judicial
philosophy
between
two
nisi
prius
judges,
that
is
all
that
this
case
is
based
upon.
and
i
submit
to
“president
truman”
that
the
other
charges
are
red
herrings
to
be
brought
up
here.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
armed
robbery
charge.
that
is
the
only
charge
upon
which
the
appeal
was
based.
i
believe
there
is
a
question
as
to
why
the
other
charges
were
in
appeal.
very
candidly
your
honor,
i
think,
i'm
a
rather
pragmatic
lawyer
where
a
man
is
giving
concurrent
or
suspended
sentences,
i'm
not
about
to
appeal.
and
without
the
authority
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
i
wouldn't
dare
to
have
entered
appeal
in
this
case
and
so
i
chose
not
to.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
absolutely.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
is
your
honor
talking
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
what
is
--
it
is
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
your
honor.
i've
never
raised
that.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
either.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh,
obviously,
i
mean
certainly.
but
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
if
the
first
judge
had
given
moon
20
years,
whether
that
would
have
been
improper,
i
will
tell
this
court
quite
frankly,
if
we're
getting
into
an
area
of
judgment,
there
was
nothing
improper
about
giving
moon
20
years,
in
all
candor,
well,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
but
let's
just
say
i've
never
argued
that
the
sentence
itself
was
harsh.
that
is
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
totally
irrelevant.
the
first
judge
passed
a
valid
sentence,
the
second
judge
passed
a
valid
sentence.
now,
the
fact
of
this
increased
knowledge
in
all
of
this
is
again
completely
outside
of
the
record
in
this
case.
i
think
--
no,
certainly
this
court
knows
better
than
i
would
admit,
when
it
talks
about
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trial.
with
all
due
respect
to
my
brother,
there
is
no
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trial
in
this
case
except
a
second
trial
and
certainly
i
would
hope
the
state
is
not
going
to
argue
that
because
he
plead
guilty
at
the
first
trial
and
didn't
plead
guilty
at
the
second
trial
that
that
is
conduct
for
which
the
second
trial
judge
can
take
a
judicial
notice.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no,
the
question
was
raised
if
it
please
the
court
as
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
plead
that
he
admitted
his
guilt
at
the
end
of
this
first
trial
but
denied
his
guilt
at
the
end
of
his
second
trial
prior
the
sentencing.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
now,
if
i
recall
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
at
the
first
trial,
he
said
he
did
it.
at
the
second
trial,
he
denied
he
did
it.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that
is
quite
a
difference
but
as
the
court
--
i
--
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
the
court
can
say
that
that
is
conduct
justifying
subsequent
to
his
first
conviction
which
would
justify
an
increased
sentence.
i
can't
--
if
that's
part
of
his
trial
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
i
--
i
interpret
it
very
strictly
your
honor
that
conduct
means
the
events
which
the
court
has
talked
about
perhaps
as
being
a
disorderly
prisoner,
perhaps
creating
further
crimes.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
like
lying
--
you
mean
not
telling
the
truth
or
being
in
prison?
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
conduct.
certainly,
conduct
to
me
mean
further
trouble
very
candidly
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
further
trouble,
i
think
that
should
be
subject
to
further
proceedings.
but
i
think
conduct
means
as
this
court
as
i
think
meant
in
the
three
opinions
in
pearce
for
facts
and
i
know
mr.
justice
white
that
you
interpreted
conduct
to
mean
any
events
which
the
second
trial
judge
knew
which
the
first
trial
judge
did
not,
but
i
think
that
by
your
opinion
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct,
but
i
think
your
honor
was
acknowledging
that
the
majority,
the
court
opinion
restricted
conduct
to
facts
that
occurred
after
the
first
conviction.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
have
very
strong
doubts
about
holding
that
to
be
perjury
in
itself.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
but
well
--
but
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
that
was
perjury
which
it
seems
to
me
would
have
--
under
maryland
law
would
have
to
be
a
separate
trial
on
that
question
of
perjury.
perjury
is
a
felony
under
maryland
law
and
you
can't
--
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
think
the
second
trial
judge
could
then
say
look
at
the
record
of
the
first
trial
and
say
you're
lying
moon.
you
admitted
at
the
first
trial
you
did
it
and
you're
not
admitting
it
today.
i
therefore
hold
that
you're
guilty
of
perjury
and
under
the
authority
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
i
sentence
you
to
an
additional
eight
years
in
jail.
frankly
your
honor,
that's
just
a
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh!
your
honor
i
don't
think
so
very
frankly.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
it's
not,
he
stood
up.
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel,
but
he
stood
up
and
judge
pugh
said
“do
you
have
anything
to
say?”
and
he
said
i
didn't
do
it.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
he
didn't
do
it.
and
i
very
frankly,
it
would
be
most
reluctant
to
ever
prosecute
a
case
of
perjury
based
on
those
circumstances.
now,
as
to
retroact
--
i
might
say
your
honor
also
that
the
courts
supplying
a
affidavit,
some
three-and-one-half
years
later
conceded
that
pearce
did
not
exist
is
if
i
may
be
facetious,
bad
retroactivity
as
opposed
to
the
good
retroactivity,
i'm
trying
to
urge
in
holding
pearce
to
be
fully
retroactive.
if
it
is
in
effect
a
nunc
pro
tunc
rationalization
of
the
sentence.
now,
if
judge
pugh
had
stated
reasons
at
the
closing
argument,
judge
pugh
felt
that
this
man
had
committed
a
bad
crime
and
deserved
20
years.
that's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it.
and
very
frankly
i
am
not
arguing
with
judge
pugh
that
he
didn't
deserve
every
day
of
those
20
years.
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court
today
and
i
think
that
the
rest
of
it
about
other
charges,
about
they're
being
malice
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issue
before
the
court,
i'm
sorry,
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
robert
anthony
jacques,
attorney
for
petitioner
number
267.
i
believe
a
brief
statement
of
the
chronology
of
events
would
be
in
order
before
we
start
the
issues
presented
to
me
by
the
court
in
this
case
under
the
instructions
of
last
june
23.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
dennis
mullene
moon
was
arrested
on
june
2,
1964
and
was
tried
on
december
17,
1964,
convicted
on
january
7,
1965
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
in
the
circuit
court
for
montgomery
county,
maryland.
on
october
23,
1965,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
decided
schowgurow
versus
state
of
maryland
and
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
they
held
it
limitedly
retroactive
to
include
petitioner
in
these
proceedings
and
invited
or
said
that
he
could
avail
himself
of
that
decision
and
take
a
new
trial
if
he
so
desire
since
his
conviction
had
not
yet
been
made
final.
he
in
effect
did
take
a
new
trial
on
june
6,
1966,
and
on
june
7,
1966,
was
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
assault
with
intent
to
murder
and
larceny.
it
is
the
irony
of
this
case
that
the
second
judge
chose
to
increase
the
sentence
for
the
same
charge
for
which
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
in
both
cases,
that
is
armed
robbery
and
then
imposed
to
suspend
it,
concurrent
10-year
sentences
on
the
other
charge.
i
say
in
all
frankness
that
had
not
judge
--
had
judge
pugh
run
the
other
sentences
consecutively
and
left
the
sentence
for
armed
robbery
at
12
years,
i
would
not
be
standing
here
today,
i
would
really
have
no
case
at
all.
be
that
as
it
may,
judge
pugh
did
see
fit
to
increase
the
sentence
on
the
identical
charge
for
which
the
petitioner
had
received
12-years
to
20-years
at
his
second
trial.
this
court,
when
it
granted
certiorari
last
june,
ordered
me
to
argue
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
and
it
is
the
--
actually
judge
pugh
gave
the
petitioner
more
credit
than
he
had
received
at
his
first
trial.
judge
pugh
run
the
sentence
back
to
the
date
of
his
arrest
whereas
the
first
judge
run
it
back
to
the
date
of
his
first
sentence
only.
so
in
effect,
judge
pugh
gave
him
another
seven
months
credit
for
time.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
there's
no
question
of
credit.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
full
credit
was
given,
that's
correct.
if
i
may
proceed
your
honor
as
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
i
believe
as
a
practical
matter
that
--
may
i
state
at
the
outset
that
i
am
not
urging
the
court
as
a
practical
matter
that
every
decision
of
this
court
should
be
made
retroactive
and
i'm
not
here
to
push
that
argument.
my
argument
of
course
is
only
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
criteria
which
this
court
has
outlined,
particularly
in
stovall
versus
denno,
desist
versus
united
states
that
the
three
criteria
of
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule,
reliance
on
the
old
rule
and
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice
fully
justify
a
completely
retroactive
effect
to
this
case
before
the
court
today,
that
is
moon.
i
would
like
to
say
further
your
honor
that
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
in
effect
a
new
rule
so
that
the
question
of
retroactivity
i
believe
is
at
least
--
that
this
is
not
a
retroactive
case
in
effect.
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
north
carolina
versus
pearce
was
a
case
of
first
impression
to
this
court
and
i
intend
to
argue
it
later
to
that
effect
that
it
is
not
in
any
change
in
the
law
of
the
united
states.
it
certainly
in
the
petitioner's
opinion
is
not
a
change
in
the
laws
expounded
by
united
states
versus
ball
or
stroud
versus
united
states,
but
was
a
new
case.
i
would
also
state
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
three
criteria
stated
for
instance,
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it
is
to
allow
a
free
and
uninhibited
right
to
appellate
review
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
of
the
united
states.
certainly,
this
purpose
and
the
court
has
so
stated
in
stovall
i
believe
that
this
purpose
is
controlling
unless
the
questions
of
reliance
or
burden
are
such
as
to
overcome
it.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
those
factors
are
not
of
such
a
factor.
i
would
say
this
as
to
reliance
that
the
court
in
benton
for
instance
talked
about
collateral
estoppel.
now
the
state
may
have
--
i
would
say
first
the
state
had
no
old
rule
to
rely
on
and
i
will
approach
that
in
later.
since
they
had
no
right
rule
to
rely
on,
even
if
they
did
rely
on
the
maryland
law,
and
of
course
they
would
argue
that,
there
was
no
controlling
united
states
case
with
them
to
rely
on
and
assuming
that
there
were
under
the
doctrine
of
estoppel,
they
did
not
change
their
position
to
their
detriment
because
of
this
decision.
and
if
the
court
will
note
at
page
38
of
the
state's
brief,
they
concede
that
of
the
85
persons
retried
who
that
is,
were
reconvicted
under
schowgurow,
11
of
them
received
increased
sentences.
now,
projecting
as
a
practical
matter,
maryland's
population
is
4%
of
the
national
population,
that
would
mean
approximately
550
prisoners
in
the
state
prisons
in
this
country
who
would
be
re-sentenced.
i
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
mr.
chief
justice,
schowgurow
was
decided
on
october
of
1965.
the
state's
brief
was
submitted
in
approximately
september
of
1969,
that's
four
years.
i
don't
see
--
there
were
i
believe,
221
cases.
the
state
has
some
figures
which
they
put
in
their
brief,
but
i
don't
see
frankly
where
that
the
figures
will
change
with
time
at
all.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh,
very
frankly,
i
will
concede
that
i
borrowed
a
copy
of
the
brief
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
and
petitioner
for
respondent
there
stated
that
perhaps
up
to
70%
of
some
cases
in
north
carolina
had
received
increased
sentences.
so
perhaps
my
figures
are
at
least
subject
to
challenge,
but
i
submit
that
the
number
of
cases
involved
in
the
state
courts
cannot
be
that
great
and
in
particular,
the
burden
on
any
one
state
is
to
justify
the
reliance
on
a
rule
which
might
been
your
honor
does
not
exist
in
the
first
place.
and
if
i
may
talk
about
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
but
no
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that.
i
know
in
maryland
courts
and
i
believe
the
maryland
court
in
my
case
relied
very
heavily
on
stroud
versus
united
states
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
there
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
increase
of
sentence
at
retrial.
i
do
not
so
read
stroud
nor
do
i
read
united
states
versus
ball.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i
read
pearce
and
simpson
to
have
approached
the
prohibition
against
increase
of
sentence
with
the
exception
which
the
court
outlined
as
to
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trials.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
it
said
--
that's
correct,
they
said
--
well
as
i
recall,
there
was
no
flat
absolute
prohibition.
i
agree
with
the
court
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
--
to
that
extent,
but
the
point
that
i
originally
urged
in
my
writ
of
certiorari,
that
is
point
three
of
this
argument,
that
is
the
that
prohibition
in
fact
be
made
a
flat
prohibition
under
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
pearce
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
i
hate
to
say
it
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i'm
saying
that
the
court
did
not
go
far
enough
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
yes.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
as
to
the
question
of
and
perhaps
as
to
this
question
of
reliance,
i
know
that
the
court
stated
at
some
length
in
pearce
that
they
did
not
wish
to
overrule
the
long
line
of
cases
involved
in
stroud.
but
as
i
read
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
there,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
stand
for
the
proposition
which
the
court
feels
it
does
or
at
least
the
plurality
opinion
in
pearce
says
that
it
does.
i
have
read
the
briefs
in
the
stroud
case
and
counsel
was
arguing
there
and
as
it's
in
my
brief,
that
since
stroud
had
been
put
in
jeopardy
at
a
former
trial,
he
could
not
even
be
retried
again
for
the
same
offense,
that
is
murder
and
i
believe
--
say
with
respect
to
the
court
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
stroud
case
stands
for
and
i
believe
murphy
versus
massachusetts,
ball
versus
united
states,
all
stand
for
roughly
that
proposition.
that
is
that
the
fact
of
an
acquittal
or
the
fact
of
a
reversal
does
not
in
any
way
prohibit
retrial
for
the
same
offense
and
i'm
certainly
not
saying
that
to
this
court.
that's
an
untenable
argument.
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
until
pearce
had
never
decided
the
question
of
increase
of
sentence
at
retrial.
now,
if
i
may
--
as
to
the
question
of
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
right
your
honor
and
of
course
this
came
--
his
case
came
back
here
ironically
in
1916
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
--
some
4
years
later.
if
i
recall
in
may
of
1916,
he
received
the
death
sentence.
he
then
appealed
and
got
life
the
second
time
and
then
on
the
theory
of
pushing
his
luck
i
suppose,
then
got
a
third
trial.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
and
got
death
again
and
it
was
in
that
case
that
his
counsel
urged
that
since
he'd
already
put
in
jeopardy
for
his
life,
he
couldn't
be
tried
again
the
third
time
at
all.
and
i've
read
stroud
and
i'm
convinced
that
that's
what
this
court
was
deciding
in
stroud
that
there
was
no
reason
not
to
retry
him
a
third
time.
if
i
may
proceed
then
as
to
the
question
of
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
as
to
double
jeopardy,
i
know
that
this
court
has
in
pearce
decided
that
the
double
jeopardy
argument
is
not
applicable.
may
i
say
respectfully
that
a
close
reading
of
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
of
the
study
since
then
and
in
fact
the
first
draft
of
james
madison's
article
for
the
fifth
amendment
in
which
mr.
madison
stated
that
there
should
be
no
more
than
one
punishment
nor
one
crime,
nor
one
trial
for
the
same
offense.
unfortunately,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
article,
there
was
so
much
confusion
as
to
whether
punishment
mean
they
couldn't
be
retried,
exactly
the
stroud
question
that
mr.
madison
was
forced
to
change
his
original
language.
i
think
very
frankly
your
honor
that
the
language,
the
cases
which
i
feel
are
applicable
to
this
case
are
not
ball
and
not
stroud,
but
ex
parte
lang
in
18
wallace
and
united
states
versus
benz
in
which
this
court
said
in
ex
parte
lang
that
the
reality
of
trial
is
not
the
trial
itself,
but
the
punishment.
and
i
might
say
to
the
court,
i've
only
been
in
practice
of
law
seven
years,
but
i
have
never
had
a
case
in
which
i've
--
in
which
the
overwhelming
desire
and
concern
of
the
prisoner
was
not
the
punishment
involved.
i
know
that
there
maybe
some
cases
where
because
of
security
clearance
or
professional
reputation,
the
conviction
is
the
man
would
do
anything
to
avoid
a
conviction.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
submit
that
in
--
at
least
in
my
experience,
90%
of
the
appeals
that
go
to
the
state
and
federal
appellate
courts
in
this
country
are
in
some
way
related
to
the
issue
of
punishment.
i
think
that
as
the
ultimate
reality
of
criminal
law
and
i
think
very
frankly
to
separate
double
jeopardy
from
trial,
from
double
jeopardy
as
far
as
it
concerns,
the
sentence
is
to
do
--
is
to
incorrectly
judge
in
my
opinion
the
clear
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
says
in
jeopardy
of
--
nor
shall
not
twice
be
put
in
jeopardy
not
by
conviction,
but
of
life
and
limb
that
is
punishment.
and
i
submit
that
--
your
honor
that
the
state
has
raised
several
questions
about,
well,
if
you
extended
it
to
a
flat
prohibition,
what
would
happen?
you'd
have
everybody
appealing.
we
--
i
have
statistics
your
honor
that
show
that
in
some
circuits,
the
rate
of
appeal
is
approaching
90%
now.
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
for
a
crime
involving
of
more
than
one
year
imprisonment,
you
have
two
automatic
reviews,
automatic,
you
don't
even
have
to
request
them.
i
submit
further
that
the
state
is
apparently
been
saying
all
along
that
the
second
trial
judge
sits
de
novo
and
accordingly,
he
has
the
right
to
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
the
first
judge
because
the
first
judgment
has
ceased
to
exist.
if
i
recall
the
language
of
the
court
in
pearce,
is
that
the
first
judgment,
the
first
sentence
insofar
does
not
conserve
becomes
a
nullity.
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
that
this
nullity
argument
simply
is
not
--
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
argument
in
pearce
at
all.
it
cannot
be
made
--
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
argument
in
pearce.
i
cited
for
instance
in
my
brief
and
i
would
very
much
like
the
state
of
maryland
to
answer
this
question.
reeves
versus
state,
3
maryland
appeal
195,
where
the
defendant
had
served
some
six
years
of
a
sentence,
of
20
years
if
i
recall.
he
then
got
a
new
trial
and
got
20
years
in
prison.
now,
the
court
said,
we
agree
that
this
is
a
de
novo
proceeding.
we
agree
the
slate
as
wiped
clean.
we
agree
that
if
the
former
sentence
is
a
nullity,
but
you
still
can't
sentence
a
man
to
26
years
on
a
20-year
maximum
charge.
as
i
said
to
the
court
of
appeals
when
i
argued
this,
i
said
i
defy,
i
didn't
say
i
defy,
i
said
i
would
like
the
court
to
explain
the
distinction
between
its
rationale
in
moon
and
its
rationale
in
reeves.
if
the
former
sentence
is
a
nullity,
then
it
seizes
to
exist
and
if
the
man
gets
another
maximum
sentence,
it's
perfectly
proper.
now,
this
is
the
logical
extension
of
the
reeves
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
declined
to
hear
that
case.
the
state
asked
for
certiorari
and
they
simply
did
not
take
the
case.
and
i
well
say
when
i
was
arguing
the
case,
one
of
the
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
said,
he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
man
got
a
de
novo
trial
and
got
another
20
years
and
wound
up
serving
26
years
on
the
20
year
charge,
that
was
perfectly
alright
because
the
former
sentence
was
a
nullity.
i
submit
with
respect
to
the
court
that
you
cannot
consider
a
sentence
as
a
nullity.
it
is
there
and
it
is
why
most
appeals
are
taken.
now,
the
courts
in
the
state
of
maryland,
and
the
maryland
courts
have
said
that
and
they've
cited
from
other
cases
that
on
appeal,
the
trial
judge
--
the
court
of
appeals
will
reverse
a
sentence
if
it
is
excessive
and
they
feel
that
it
violates
liberty
and
due
process.
now,
your
honor,
my
set
of
the
maryland
reports
go
back
to
1682,
i
believe,
that's
the
nominatives
of
maryland
and
they
have
recently
stated
that
there
is
no
case
on
record
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
ever
reduced
a
sentence.
and
in
fact,
i
submit
to
the
court
to
the
best
of
anyone's
knowledge
in
the
entire,
almost
300
years
of
the
appellate
procedure
in
maryland,
not
a
single
case
has
ever
been
reversed
because
the
appellate
court
felt
that
the
trial
judge
had
been
too
harsh.
now
in
fact,
in
the
last
few
years,
the
maryland
legislature
has
seen
fit
to
establish
a
new
procedure
for
appellate
review
sentence
under
rule
762,
the
maryland
rules
of
procedure.
this
involves
a
three-man
bench
of
which
the
sentencing
judge
is
one
and
he
may
then
--
they
may
then
either
increase
the
sentence,
leave
it
alone
or
decrease
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
ultimate
issue.
the
state
of
maryland
has
now
recognized
that
there
is
a
division
between
the
appeal
of
the
trial
and
the
appeal
of
the
sentence.
and
if
we
can
--
i'm
asking
this
court
to
recognize
that
distinction
in
pearce
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
accept
what
i
believe
was
the
logical
extension
of
green
versus
united
states
and
the
very
fine
article
by
professor
ben
olstein
about
this
problem
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief.
and
in
green,
if
we
--
if
the
court
will
accept
the
idea
of
implicit
acquittal
insofar
as
the
trial
goes,
then
i
see
nothing
wrong
and
in
fact
i
think
it's
perfectly
logical
to
say
that
there
has
been
an
implicit
acquittal
insofar
as
any
higher
sentence
goes.
in
other
words,
that
court
has
established
the
maximum
sentence
and
upon
retrial,
while
there
maybe
another
sentence
obviously,
it
cannot
exceed
that
valid
sentence.
i'm
asking
the
court
in
other
words
to
face
what
i
consider
is
the
reality
of
appeals
that
almost
every
appeal
is
a
somehow
an
appeal
of
the
sentence
and
that
because
our
courts
do
not
recognize
that
on
appeal,
somehow
error
has
to
be
found.
i
would
venture
to
this
court
that
if
you
promise
every
prisoner
in
a
--
in
any
jail
in
the
united
states
that
he
would
be
released
if
he
dropped
his
appeal,
i
would
venture
that
90%
of
them
would
drop
the
appeal
immediately.
and
i
would
venture
further
that
if
you
release
them
and
said
you
can
ahead
with
your
appeal,
it
doesn't
matter,
they
still
would
drop
their
appeal
because
we
are
faced
here
and
i
know
this
court
is
facing
other
cases.
we
just
heard
one
about
--
i
think
that
the
sentencing
area
is
the
most
sensitive
area
that
this
court
must
now
resolve.
i
know
that
there
is
a
capital
punishment
case
set.
i
know
north
carolina
versus
alfred
is
set
very
soon,
or
has
been
already
argued.
this,
it
is
now
--
i
think
the
courts,
particularly
this
court
in
pearce
have
finally
faced
this
entire
area
of
sentencing
and
punishment
and
that
is
the
ultimate
reality
of
the
law
of
this
case
and
the
law
of
every
case.
there
is
no
good
reason
not
to
apply
north
carolina
versus
pearce
retroactively.
what
is
going
to
be
the
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice?
almost
nominal,
not
one
guilty
person
is
going
to
be
turned
lose.
if
every
prisoner
in
the
state
came
under
this
rule
and
i
say
it
is
only
11,
if
every
prisoner
came,
what
would
happen,
he
would
be
brought
back
to
the
sentencing
court
and
sentenced
in
accordance
with
this
case.
i
do
not
consider
that
an
undue
burden.
not
one
person
is
going
to
go
free
because
of
this
case.
as
to
reliance
upon
the
old
rule,
we've
already
discussed
that.
i
submit
very
respectfully,
there
is
no
old
rule.
so
that
is
why
i
contend
that
the
question
of
retroactivity
does
not
even
apply
here.
because
i
know
in
desist
the
court
talked
about
changes
in
the
law
and
a
clear
break
with
the
old
law,
but
there
is
no
old
law
to
break
with
in
this
case.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'm
saving
some
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
all
due
deference
to
my
brother
at
the
bar,
i
frankly
find
his
argument
almost
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court
today.
first
of
all
to
go
immediately
to
the
question
of
vindictiveness,
very
frankly
i
do
not
understand
that
the
pearce
case
is
limited
to
where
the
second
judge
is
being
vindictive.
i
took
it
to
mean
that
this
was
a
means
of
taking
off
any
chilling
effect
on
the
right
of
appeal.
now,
i
have
never
contended
that
judge
pugh
was
vindictive.
i
know
judge
pugh
personally.
i
was
a
law
clerk
in
that
courthouse
and
the
state
has
consistently
been
setting
up
with
all
due
respect
to
saint
thomas
aquinas,
the
straw
man
that
the
vindictiveness
of
the
second
trial
judge
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
appeal.
i
am
saying
to
the
court
that
if
judge
pugh
had
the
highest
motives
in
the
world,
the
ultimate
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
dennis
moon
was
sentenced
to
an
additional
eight-years
imprisonment.
the
motivation,
please
the
court
is
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
absolutely
not
your
honor.
i
do
not
read
it
to
be
restricted
to
vindictive
second
sentencing
judges.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
more
to
know,
but
you're
--
(voice
overlap)
but
your
honor,
i
think
of
reading
the
majority,
plurality
opinion
in
pearce
which
was
based
on
due
process.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
the
court
opinion
which
was
based
as
i
recall
on
due
process.
i
don't
recall
that
the
court
stated
that
it
was
restricted
to
where
there
was
factual
evidence
that
the
second
trial
judge
had
been
vindictive
and
malicious
in
his
sentence.
and
i
think
that
the
state
is
very
cleverly
trying
to
restrict
this
argument
to
that
issue
which
is
i
submit
totally
irrelevant
to
these
proceedings.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
dennis
moon
received
additional
time
in
jail.
he
obviously
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
and
the
issue
then
your
honor
is
that
punishment,
is
that
increased
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
pearce.
i
submit
to
--
since
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
an
increased
punishment
and
i
submit
that
vindictiveness,
malice
are
totally
irrelevant.
it
is
simply
a
different
judicial
philosophy
between
two
nisi
prius
judges,
that
is
all
that
this
case
is
based
upon.
and
i
submit
to
“president
truman”
that
the
other
charges
are
red
herrings
to
be
brought
up
here.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
armed
robbery
charge.
that
is
the
only
charge
upon
which
the
appeal
was
based.
i
believe
there
is
a
question
as
to
why
the
other
charges
were
in
appeal.
very
candidly
your
honor,
i
think,
i'm
a
rather
pragmatic
lawyer
where
a
man
is
giving
concurrent
or
suspended
sentences,
i'm
not
about
to
appeal.
and
without
the
authority
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
i
wouldn't
dare
to
have
entered
appeal
in
this
case
and
so
i
chose
not
to.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
absolutely.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
is
your
honor
talking
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
what
is
--
it
is
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
your
honor.
i've
never
raised
that.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
either.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh,
obviously,
i
mean
certainly.
but
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
if
the
first
judge
had
given
moon
20
years,
whether
that
would
have
been
improper,
i
will
tell
this
court
quite
frankly,
if
we're
getting
into
an
area
of
judgment,
there
was
nothing
improper
about
giving
moon
20
years,
in
all
candor,
well,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
but
let's
just
say
i've
never
argued
that
the
sentence
itself
was
harsh.
that
is
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
totally
irrelevant.
the
first
judge
passed
a
valid
sentence,
the
second
judge
passed
a
valid
sentence.
now,
the
fact
of
this
increased
knowledge
in
all
of
this
is
again
completely
outside
of
the
record
in
this
case.
i
think
--
no,
certainly
this
court
knows
better
than
i
would
admit,
when
it
talks
about
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trial.
with
all
due
respect
to
my
brother,
there
is
no
conduct
subsequent
to
the
first
trial
in
this
case
except
a
second
trial
and
certainly
i
would
hope
the
state
is
not
going
to
argue
that
because
he
plead
guilty
at
the
first
trial
and
didn't
plead
guilty
at
the
second
trial
that
that
is
conduct
for
which
the
second
trial
judge
can
take
a
judicial
notice.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no,
the
question
was
raised
if
it
please
the
court
as
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
plead
that
he
admitted
his
guilt
at
the
end
of
this
first
trial
but
denied
his
guilt
at
the
end
of
his
second
trial
prior
the
sentencing.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
now,
if
i
recall
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
at
the
first
trial,
he
said
he
did
it.
at
the
second
trial,
he
denied
he
did
it.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that
is
quite
a
difference
but
as
the
court
--
i
--
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
the
court
can
say
that
that
is
conduct
justifying
subsequent
to
his
first
conviction
which
would
justify
an
increased
sentence.
i
can't
--
if
that's
part
of
his
trial
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well,
i
--
i
interpret
it
very
strictly
your
honor
that
conduct
means
the
events
which
the
court
has
talked
about
perhaps
as
being
a
disorderly
prisoner,
perhaps
creating
further
crimes.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
like
lying
--
you
mean
not
telling
the
truth
or
being
in
prison?
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
conduct.
certainly,
conduct
to
me
mean
further
trouble
very
candidly
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
further
trouble,
i
think
that
should
be
subject
to
further
proceedings.
but
i
think
conduct
means
as
this
court
as
i
think
meant
in
the
three
opinions
in
pearce
for
facts
and
i
know
mr.
justice
white
that
you
interpreted
conduct
to
mean
any
events
which
the
second
trial
judge
knew
which
the
first
trial
judge
did
not,
but
i
think
that
by
your
opinion
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
that's
correct,
but
i
think
your
honor
was
acknowledging
that
the
majority,
the
court
opinion
restricted
conduct
to
facts
that
occurred
after
the
first
conviction.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
well
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
have
very
strong
doubts
about
holding
that
to
be
perjury
in
itself.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
but
well
--
but
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
that
was
perjury
which
it
seems
to
me
would
have
--
under
maryland
law
would
have
to
be
a
separate
trial
on
that
question
of
perjury.
perjury
is
a
felony
under
maryland
law
and
you
can't
--
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
think
the
second
trial
judge
could
then
say
look
at
the
record
of
the
first
trial
and
say
you're
lying
moon.
you
admitted
at
the
first
trial
you
did
it
and
you're
not
admitting
it
today.
i
therefore
hold
that
you're
guilty
of
perjury
and
under
the
authority
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
i
sentence
you
to
an
additional
eight
years
in
jail.
frankly
your
honor,
that's
just
a
--
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
oh!
your
honor
i
don't
think
so
very
frankly.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
it's
not,
he
stood
up.
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel,
but
he
stood
up
and
judge
pugh
said
“do
you
have
anything
to
say?”
and
he
said
i
didn't
do
it.
mr.
robert
anthony
jacques
he
didn't
do
it.
and
i
very
frankly,
it
would
be
most
reluctant
to
ever
prosecute
a
case
of
perjury
based
on
those
circumstances.
now,
as
to
retroact
--
i
might
say
your
honor
also
that
the
courts
supplying
a
affidavit,
some
three-and-one-half
years
later
conceded
that
pearce
did
not
exist
is
if
i
may
be
facetious,
bad
retroactivity
as
opposed
to
the
good
retroactivity,
i'm
trying
to
urge
in
holding
pearce
to
be
fully
retroactive.
if
it
is
in
effect
a
nunc
pro
tunc
rationalization
of
the
sentence.
now,
if
judge
pugh
had
stated
reasons
at
the
closing
argument,
judge
pugh
felt
that
this
man
had
committed
a
bad
crime
and
deserved
20
years.
that's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it.
and
very
frankly
i
am
not
arguing
with
judge
pugh
that
he
didn't
deserve
every
day
of
those
20
years.
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court
today
and
i
think
that
the
rest
of
it
about
other
charges,
about
they're
being
malice
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issue
before
the
court,
i'm
sorry,
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
