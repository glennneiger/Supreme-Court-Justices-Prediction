what
about
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
assuming
that
very
capable
in
hard
rending
courts
here
have
been
connecticut
go
wrong
and
the
petition
i
think
she
was
desirable
and
above
divorce
and
didn't
get
it,
what
is
she
have
to
pay
for
her
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
printing
of
briefs
or
records
or
any
cost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lafrance
they
have
service
of
publication?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
under
your
argument,
who
paid
for
that,
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lafrance,
what
do
you
do
about
man
who
wants
to
sue
to
prevent
pollution
of
the
air
by
the
electric
company
in
new
heaven?
would
he
have
to
pay
fees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
want
that
in
the
same
indigent
protection,
you
have
a
criminal
prosecution.
do
you
happen
o
go
that
far
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
person
is
filed
for
air
pollution
and
some
legal
aid
society
takes
over
the
lawyer
part,
it
doesn't
pay
his
fees,
and
then
he
wants
to
appeal
and
takes
care
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
cost.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
personally
don't
know
of
any
system
that
court
cost
take
care
of
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
never
do.
i
mean,
they
always
need
that
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
make
much
more
sense
with
me,
if
you
could
draw
a
line
other
than
saying
that
in
all
civil
actions,
the
person
without
income
can
file
without
payment
of
fees,
which
is
a
pretty
broad
hump
of
litigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
supposing
with
this,
supposing
sue
for
million
dollars
and
gets
million
dollars,
can
the
state
get
his
$20.00
file
fee
out
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'd
hope
so.
