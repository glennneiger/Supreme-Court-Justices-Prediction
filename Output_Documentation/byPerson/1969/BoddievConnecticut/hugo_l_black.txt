question

are
you
not?
are
you
arguing
that
because
of
rich
man
can
hire
lawyer
to
get
a

the

must
supply
lawyer
for
a
poor
women
or
poor
men
wants
to
get

justice

well,
how
could
you
keep
from
doing
it
if
you
made

pay

the
case
on

you
wouldn't

how
could

try

they

--
one
finally
gets

and
use
the

justice

black
i
don't
quite
get
that
reason.
whether
you

you
draw
there.
maybe
the

so
indigent
that
can't
hire
a

for

why

not?

if
it's

wouldn't
be
anyway
to
equal
that?
justice

why
not
they
not
be

to
go
far
on

eventually
on
your
argument
to
say
that
the

are
necessary
to
civilized

you
got
to
have
them

therefore,
they
must
supply
to
all
without
regard
to
their
race,
color
or
amount
of
money
they
have.
justice

black
but
the
only
way
to
do
that
unless
you
see
that
they
deny
equal
protection
to
the
rich.
it
would
be
to
say
that
the
court
from
us
we
owned
the
all
to
prosecute
or
defend
that
claim
whether
they
have
money

do

all.
it
seems
to

this.
i'm

i'm

well,
i'm
interested

i
asked
the
question.
i'm
interested
in
it
for
this
reason.
we
should
not
decide
the
case
of
this
wide

on
a
great
constitutional
question.
if
as
a

of
fact,
provisions
are
already
made
by
the

to
take
care
of
the

if
they
had
to
have
--
justice

black
i
should
think,
it
be
a
problem
of
the
state
to
raise
all
the
defenses
it
has.
one
of
them
being
that
you're
not
stating
the
fact
when
you
say,
you
do
not
have
the
money
and
can't
get
it
because
there
is
provision
made
for
it
in
the
federal

state
contributions
joined.
justice

i
understand
that.
justice

black
even
the
federalism
and
the
state
has.
justice

then
they
knew
where
the

comes
from.
if
the
people
can
get
it
to
conduct
their

cases,
then
connecticut
--
we
should
not
branch
out

enter
decision

constitutionality
which
practically
owns
us
away
for
paying
the
use
of

all

well,
that's
the

before,
certainly?
justice

that's
that
issue
before

well,
whether
the
--
justice

black
you
need
it

it
without

justice

that's
the
state
of

they
actually
have
money

what
is
that

he
is
talking

justice

are
you
taking

i
have
an
idea
that
the
federal

did
supply
for

unnecessary
expenses
so
much
for
money
and
they
included
on
all
necessary
expenses.
are
you
taking
the
position
to
pay
due
do
that
that?
that
you
should
be

have
us
pass
on

how
do

one
way

another,

would
you
object
it

was
available

suppose
it
hasn't

we
found
out
that's
true.
should
we
still
go
ahead
and
pass
on
the
constitutional
question
which
perhaps
reach
all
civil
cases?
justice

well,
we
will
then
raise
it
and
we
found
it
up
here.
justice

in
the
question
--
in
the
court.
justice

i
think
if

so.
you
suggested
