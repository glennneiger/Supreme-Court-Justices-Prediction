justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
basic
difference
do
you
suppose
between
your
case
and
other
civil
litigation
generally
that
parties
are
always
afraid
to
compromise
or
settle?
are
their
quarrels
within
the
form
of
litigation
or
not
but
the
divorce
matter
that
is
a
civil
case
which
can
only
be
decided
by
a
judicial
decree
and
cannot
be
compromised
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
--
compromised
here,
something
short
of
divorce?
justice
potter
stewart
i
supposed
there
could
be
a
settlement
here
by
something
short
of
divorce
just
this
--
like
there
can
be
and
if
somebody
suing
you
for
$100,000.00,
you
settled
for
short
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
could
agree
to
live
apart?
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
agree
to
live
apart
if
they
were
to
agree
to
that
which
in
point
a
fact
most
of
them
have
done.
what
would
happen
is
that
they
would
be
locked
into
marriages
which
were
meaningless,
which
was
barren.
they
would
also
be
cut
off
from
some
rather
important
rights,
the
right
to
remarried,
the
right
to
appropriate,
the
right
to
form
new
families.
and
this
court
is
said
that
those
rights
are
rights
of
considerably
significant.
i
might
also
note
as
we
have
in
our
brief
that
denial
of
access
to
divorce
for
the
poor
opposes
peculiar
problems
which
may
not
be
post
for
other
segments
of
society
because
denial
of
that
access
aggravates
the
economic
circumstances
under
which
the
poor
live.
it
may
also
further
weakened
the
family
structure
patterns
which
sociologist
indicate
are
prevalent
among
the
poor.
whether
or
not
that
peculiar
problem
for
the
poor
are
cognoscible
by
this
court,
it
is
at
least
clear
that
by
connecticut's
law,
anybody
who
is
cutoff
from
divorce
is
cutoff
from
remarriage
and
is
cutoff
from
appropriation
with
anyone
other
than
her
legal
spouse.
what
we
are
submitting
is
that
since
and
in
fact
these
marriages
have
seized
to
exist
in
legal
contemplation;
that
fact
ought
to
be
recognized.
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
general
cannon,
i
notice
in
the
appendix,
appendix
a
to
the
brief
of
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association
amicus
brief
that
connecticut
as
listed
here
is
having
the
court's
there
of
having
power
to
waive
these
fees,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
so,
it's
limited
only
to
the
kind
of
an
action?
justice
potter
stewart
an
action
for
maintenance
and
support?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
that
under
ueresa,
i'd
now
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
$119,000.00
or
people?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
any
further
or
other
expenses
across
that
there
might
be
for
service
and
so
on.
as
i
read
it
on
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
your
brief,
it
just
$45.00
but
what
it
says
each
civil
cost?
justice
potter
stewart
however,
that's
defined
else
where
in
your
statutes,
i
don't
know,
but
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
civil
case,
you
have
to
pay
for
$45.00
quite
apart
for
any
additional
expenses?
justice
potter
stewart
in
all
civil
actions,
typically
tort,
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
without
what
kinds
of
fees
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
this
was
decided
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
everything
alleged
in
the
complaint
was
taken
to
be
true
by
the
three-judge
district
court
very
properly.
and
it
assumed
now,
the
allegations
were
true
and
then
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
but
that
complaint
was
supported
by
affidavits,
just
take
a
sample
one
appearing
on
page
11
on
the
record.
affidavits
sworn
to
under
oath
in
which
the
appellant
(ph)
says
among
other
things
that
their
welfare
benefits
from
the
state
of
connecticut
do
not
include
an
allotment
for
legal
and
court
fees.
now,
there
are
several
other
affidavits
containing
the
same
or
similar
statement.
and
that
appears
to
be
true,
at
least
just
sworn
to
under
oath
and
for
familiar
grounds
of
practice
and
procedure
and
pleading
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
all
of
those
allegations
were
assumed
to
be
true
by
the
district
court
properly.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
reason,
we
have
no
evidence
in
this
case.
we
simply
have
the
allegations
of
a
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
was
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
point
of
peeping
in
to
these
extra
curricular,
extra
records?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
john
cannon,
right
of
outset
of
his
argument,
mr.
lafrance
said
that
he
satisfied
himself
by
investigation
that
at
least
with
respect
to
five
of
these
plaintiffs,
these
cases
were
not
moot.
and
i
took
that
as
a
professional
representation
that
these
people
did
not
have
the
money,
the
$45.00
to
pay
the
filing
fee.
and
furthermore,
may
i
point
out
that
the
state
of
connecticut,
your
client,
when
it
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
this
complaint,
admitted
every
allegation
of
the
complaint.
that's
what
the
motion
to
dismiss
does.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
you
know,
it
surprises
me
that
you're
taking
such
a
different
posture
now
that
you're
here
in
this
court.
now,
you're
beginning
to
deny
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
place
to
do
that
is
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
