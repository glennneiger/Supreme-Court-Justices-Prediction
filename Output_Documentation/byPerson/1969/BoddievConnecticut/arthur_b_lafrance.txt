mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
padnos
closed
by
saying
that
when
he
sought
was
the
opportunity
to
get
into
court.
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
appellant
seek
in
this
case.
the
appellants
initiated
this
proceeding
by
bringing
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut.
they
allege
in
their
complaint
that
they
wished,
intended
to
sue
their
husbands
for
divorce
in
the
connecticut
superior
courts,
but
that
is
welfare
recipients
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
court
cost
of
approximately
$60.00
or
more.
as
a
consequence,
they
had
set
their
divorce
papers
to
the
superior
court
for
new
haven
county,
with
applications
asking
that
court
to
waive
the
filing
fees
and
to
arrange
service
of
process.
these
papers
where
all
set
back
by
the
clerk
of
that
court.
upon
received
of
these
papers,
appellants
then
asked
superior
court
judge
longo
and
after
speaking
with
him,
the
state
supreme
court
administrator
justice
carter
to
reverse
the
position
which
had
been
taken
by
the
superior
court
clerk
edward
orimits.
they
sustained
that
position
and
as
a
consequence,
appellants
were
effectively
bard
from
access
to
the
courts
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
further
alleged
in
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
that
this
denied
them
constitutional
rights
involving
due
process
and
equal
protection.
the
appellee
is
moved
to
dismiss
their
motion
with
sustain
by
a
--
or
granted
by
a
three-judge-panel
and
this
direct
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court.
the
question
which
is
thus
presented
is
has
connecticut
by
erecting
economic
barriers
to
its
court
denied
these
appellants
the
rights
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
laws
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
if
i
may
turn
first
to
our
due
process
contention,
we
founded
upon
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
a
right
which
is
expressed
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
which
is
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth.
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
naacp
versus
button,
united
mine
workers
versus
the
brotherhood
of
railway
engineers
and
the
united
mine
workers
--
i'm
sorry,
the
united
mine
workers
versus
illinois
bar
association
and
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman
versus
virginia,
all
of
these
cases
are
squarely
precedent
for
this.
the
appellees
may
attempt
to
distinguish
them
on
the
ground
that
the
litigation
contemplated
in
button
was
of
a
political
nature
whereas
the
litigation
appellants
contemplate
is
of
a
personal
nature,
but
that
distinction
was
rejected
in
the
mine
worker's
case;
a
second
distinction
maybe
that
these
cases
involved
the
right
of
assembly
rather
than
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
but
we
submit
that
the
language
of
these
three
cases
discusses
these
two
rights
independently
and
accords
to
them
equal
status.
the
right
of
assembly
and
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
indeed
in
these
cases,
their
would
hardly
have
been
any
point
to
assembly
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
to
unable
individuals
as
here
to
bring
suits
on
their
on
behalf.
this
is
a
fundamental
right.
this
court
has
said
that
the
right
sue
and
defend
in
the
courts
is
the
alternative
of
force
in
an
organize
society.
it
is
the
right
conservative
of
all
other
rights
and
lies
at
the
foundations
of
orderly
government.
turning
to
our
equal
protection
contention,
it
is
clear
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
can
be
denied
by
economic
discrimination
as
surely
as
racial
discrimination.
this
court
recognized
that
in
edwards
versus
california
in
1941
and
as
reaffirmed
it
in
many
decisions
sense
most
recently
in
mcdonald
versus
board
of
elections.
perhaps
the
most
significant
case
here
is
griffin
versus
illinois
where
this
court
held
that
appellant
remedies
could
not
be
denied
to
a
person
convicted
of
crime
simply
because
of
its
inability
to
purchase
a
transcript
for
appeal.
appellees
brief
at
great
length
has
attempted
to
distinguish
griffin
from
this
case.
appellees
have
set
first
that
griffin
is
a
criminal
case
and
that
this
is
a
civil
case,
the
present
proceeding.
and
point
of
fact,
however,
this
is
a
distinction
which
is
not
recognized
by
the
constitution
appears
no
where
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
was
not
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
that
decision
dealt
not
with
criminal
procedure,
but
with
court
procedure,
and
it
is
court
procedure
which
these
appellants
seek
to
pursue.
a
second
distinction
offered
in
their
brief
by
appellees
is
that
in
griffin,
liberty
was
involved
whereas
these
appellants
are
at
large
to
go
about
as
they
choose.
but
in
point
of
fact,
the
liberty
of
these
appellants
is
substantially
curd
by
their
inability
to
obtain
divorces
in
the
courts
of
connecticut
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
liberty
consist
of
more
than
simply
freedom
from
physical
restraint.
a
final
point
which
appellees
have
made
in
their
brief
is
that
griffin
should
not
govern
here
because
in
griffin,
the
state
was
the
participating
adversary.
it
was
the
state
which
had
put
mr.
griffin
in
custody
whereas
the
divorce
actions
contemplated
by
appellants
are
private
matters
between
husband
and
wife.
this
however
is
an
elusory
distinction.
it
is
the
state
which
has
bard
these
appellants
from
its
courts.
it
is
the
state
which
has
said
to
these
appellants
that
they
may
not
settle
their
marital
affairs
out
of
the
court.
thus
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
has
required
these
appellants
to
go
in
the
court
and
at
the
same
time
has
told
them
that
they
may
not
do
so.
we
submit
then
that
the
state
is
fully
as
much
as
an
adversary
in
this
proceeding
at
it
was
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
certainly
one
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
know
if
any
legal
proceeding
in
connecticut
which
would
extend
to
these
appellants
half
the
divorce
for
one
third
or
one
fourths.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
sums
are
accurate.
i
would
not
characterize
them
as
minimum
--
minimal
nor
with
my
clients.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
a
routine
divorce
of
case
would
cost
approximately
$60.00
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
suppose
this
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
let
me
first
say
that
this
court
could
draw
a
distinction
between
this
type
of
case
and
a
case
which
involves
purely
personal
private
issues,
a
negligence,
suit
or
contract
suit
are
examples
of
litigation
which
does
not
involved
with
state
in
the
same
fashion
that
a
criminal
prosecution
does
or
divorce
prosecution
--
pardon
me,
a
divorce
suit
does.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
connecticut,
a
baster
the
proceeding
involves
the
state
rather
extensively.
i
don't
know
about
other
states.
i
would
not
urge
this
distinction
upon
the
court.
the
court
of
course
is
free
to
adapt
it.
what
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
is
simply
this
that
anytime
the
states,
where
it
be
the
state
of
connecticut
or
any
other
state
creates
a
state
remedy
through
its
courts.
i
submit
that
that
the
remedy
must
be
available
to
the
poor
and
the
wealthy
alike
whether
it
involved
negligence,
divorce,
bastardy
or
whatever.
i
would
note
that
are
some
limitations
on
the
reach
of
reasoning.
the
appellees
have
noted
that
this
reasoning
would
carry
over
to
dog
licenses,
road
tolls
and
whatever.
i
contend
that
it
is
not.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
constitutional
right,
the
access
to
the
courts
maybe
deny
by
economic
barriers.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
dog
license
or
i
supposed
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
to
passage
through
a
road
toll
station.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
the
right
to
travel
were
totally
bard
by
a
state
by
toll
stations,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
person
who
he
is
thus
bard
has
a
constitutional
claim.
in
thompson
versus
shapiro
would
be
as
good
as
citation
for
that
as
any,
so
with
edwards
versus
california.
but
i
did
not
understand
that
was
the
argument
being
made
by
the
appellees.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
involved
as
they
clearly
is
here,
then
perhaps
this
court
might
distinguish
future
litigation
from
present
litigation.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
do
they
have
a
lawyer?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
they
do.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
oh
i'm
sorry,
no.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
must.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
the
right
to
access
to
the
courts
is
clearly
provided
for
in
the
constitution
by
express
provision.
there
is
no
similar
provision
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
civil
cases
or
for
appointment
of
expert
assistance.
so
in
constitutional
contemplation,
there
is
a
distinction
between
access
to
the
courts
and
appointment
of
counsel.
in
point
of
fact
also
there
is
a
distinction.
once
in
court,
a
litigate
has
an
opportunity
to
obtain
justice
given
a
reasonably
compassionate
judge
and
a
reasonably
good
case
and
affirm
amount
of
intelligence.
we
have
those
in
reasonable
abundance
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
but
if
bard
from
court,
if
her
papers
are
simply
set
back
by
the
clerk
of
court
without
any
consideration,
there's
no
opportunity
to
obtain
justice
at
all.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
submit
that
she
does
not
have
to
pay
the
court
cost
incident
to
an
appeal.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
she
might
have
to
retain
her
own
counsel
if
she
desired
counsel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
she
cannot
afford
it
--
the
--
i
supposed
one
other
factor
which
is
worth
noting
and
that
is
that
the
prevalence
of
legal
services
programs
and
the
availability
of
legal
services
attorneys
take
some
of
the
urgency
out
of
the
concern
for
availability
of
counsel.
it
does
not
relieve
the
urgency
which
is
behind
the
issues
raised
by
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
well
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
terms
of
whether
the
absence
of
a
reference
to
appeal
by
the
constitution
in
griffin
case
in
terms
of
whether
that
therefore
would
require
compelling
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
civil
cases,
i
would
only
respond
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
a
matter
which
in
criminal
cases
specifically
provided
for
and
the
absence
of
reference
to
civil
cases
could
justify
this
court
and
inferring
that
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
did
not
contemplate
appointing
counsel
in
civil
cases.
now,
i
have
somewhat
handicap
in
arguing
a
case
which
i'm
not
bringing,
but
i
do
submit
that
if
that
cases
brought
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
a
civil
case,
this
court
might
well
be
justified
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
arguments
which
would
be
submitted
at
a
later
time.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
you
might
well
say
that
or
you
might
say
only
an
important
civil
cases,
defining
that
in
various
ways.
the
problem
here
is
not
much
different
from
the
problem
which
this
court
is
cope
with
for
exampling
gideon
versus
wainwrigth
in
determining
of
whether
counsel
must
be
appointed
only
felony
cases
or
in
misdemeanor
cases
determining
the
limit
of
the
appointment
requirements
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
on
this
court's
rulings
in
loving
versus
virginia,
skinner
versus
oklahoma,
i
would
say
that
the
state
would
be
required
to
raise
--
i'm
sorry
waive
that
filling
fee
in
application
for
marriage
if
the
applicants
establish
they
could
not
pay
fee
and
if
the
state
could
not
show
a
legitimate
basis
for
imposing
the
fee.
now,
i
say
that
with
the
important
emphasis
that
what
is
involved
is
a
fundamental
right
in
marriage
according
to
this
court's
decisions,
and
i
would
therefore
distinguish
this
from
a
dog
license
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
or
perhaps
a
hunting
license.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes
and
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
right
to
work
would
then
raise
the
economic
considerations
which
might
be
to
a
conclusion
that
equal
protection
have
been
denied
the
right
to
travel
in
itself
would
be
a
constitutional
consideration
and
protected
by
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth,
the
first
amendment
providing
for
a
right
of
assembly
and
a
right
to
petition
the
courts
for
redress
the
fourteenth.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
as
i
read
this
court's
opinions
in
the
mine
worker's
case
and
in
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman
case,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
involves
both
private
and
official
grievances.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
button
case
was
primarily
focused
upon
official
grievances
in
the
sense
that
the
group
there
was
involved
with
advancing
the
political
social
interest
of
a
minority
group
which
was
being
impressed
--
discriminating
against.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
button;
that
is
true
but
in
the
mine
worker's
case
and
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman,
the
litigation
contemplated
was
for
private
gain,
for
individual
benefit.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
under
our
first
due
process
argument,
i'm
saying
that
the
states
must
afford
the
opportunity
to
come
in
to
court
and
raised
a
claim.
the
state
may
not
provide
redress
for
the
claim,
but
it
must
at
least
provide
an
opportunity
to
petition
for
redress.
under
our
equal
protection
argument,
i
am
saying
that
where
the
state
provides
a
cause
of
action
or
a
remedy,
it
must
provide
equally.
now
it
happens
that
the
state
of
connecticut
provides
for
divorce.
given
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
say
to
the
appellants
that
they
may
not
come
into
court
and
ask
for
divorce,
norm
that
it
may
have
say
to
appellants
that
divorce
is
available
to
everybody
excepting
the
poor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
two
arguments
are
quite
close.
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
significance
of
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
in
this
case
comes
about
because
of
this
court's
decisions
of
such
cases
as
shapiro
versus
thompson
in
which
the
court
had
said
that
in
order
to
justify
racial
discrimination
or
economic
discrimination
as
legitimate
legislative
policy,
a
state
must
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
necessity
for
that
discrimination.
it
may
not
show
simply
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
it,
there
must
a
compelling
necessity.
we
of
course
submit
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
such
necessity.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
do
not
conceive
that.
i
maintain
that
the
state
has
taken
two
entirely
different
types
of
action
against
these
appellants:
first,
the
procedural
action
of
barding
them
from
its
court
by
imposing
economic
barriers;
secondly,
the
anacidence
substantive
action
of
requiring
that
the
appellants
go
into
court
in
order
to
settle
their
marital
status.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
but
you
didn't
--
but
didn't
start
a
suit
attacking
the
statutes
which
might
then
be
a
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
revolving
on
you
from
the
state?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
at
connecticut
law
provides
for
that,
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
or
waived
the
publication
if
that
were
consistent
with
due
process
requirements
or
provide
for
alternative
means
of
service
or
notice.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
quite
frankly,
i'm
not
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
well,
i'm
simply
not
familiar
with
annulment
procedure.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
without
--
i
would
assume
that
my
arguments
would
extend
to
that
as
well
as
to
divorce.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
two
or
three
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
it
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
you're
appropriate,
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
let
me
pick
up
mr.
chief
justice
three
points
right
quickly.
the
first
is
that
mr.
cannon
had
suggested
that
the
appellant
should
have
bought
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
connecticut
so
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
rule
property
on
the
issues
imposed
in
this
case.
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
submitted
an
application
to
superior
court
for
new
haven
county
and
then
pursued
it
to
the
administrator
of
the
court's
of
state
of
connecticut
who
is
a
supreme
court
justice.
not
only
where
we
not
given
an
opportunity
to
present
this
issue
and
argue
it,
our
papers
were
simply
sent
back.
now
for
failure
to
pay
the
filing
fees,
if
we
have
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
the
same
filing
fees
would
have
been
required
and
our
papers
presumably
there
would
have
been
set
back.
we
did
make
the
attempt
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
the
$45.00
--
i
would
have
to
check
the
statutes
again
your
honor,
but
there
is
certainly
an
entry
fee
attached
to
all
proceedings
brought
the
superior
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
believe
so.
there
is
a
flat
$45.00
entry
fee
required
for
filling
proceedings.
there
are
some
exceptions
as
mr.
cannon
noted,
but
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
i
do
not
believe
would
be
one
of
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
service
with
me
in
addition
to
the
$45.00
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
pick
up
quickly
is
simply
that
there
is
no
justification
in
connecticut
for
imposing
this
requirement
of
filing
fees.
it
does
not
discourage
frivolous
litigation.
the
wealthy
can
bring
that
litigation
if
they
choose
to
do
so.
what
is
achieved
by
these
filing
requirements
is
that
the
poor
may
not
bring
frivolous
litigation.
we
submit
that
this
letter
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
assumed
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
does
ssumed
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
bring
on
behalf
of
the
poor
the
same
of
kind
of
litigation
which
the
wealthy
can
bring.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
perhaps,
i
should
--
well,
i
will
argue
that
but
i
would
also
contend
that
the
fee
requirement
in
connecticut
has
the
further
affect
of
discouraging
meritorious
litigation
by
the
court.
in
other
words,
it
bards
all
litigation
by
the
poor
whether
frivolous
or
not.
and
that
is
a
consequence
which
we
feel
that
constitutional
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry,
am
i
contending
that?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
because
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
require
a
person
to
come
in
to
court
with
a
lawyer.
it
requires
a
person
to
come
in
to
court
with
the
money
to
pay
filing
fees.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
case
on
which
i
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
griffin
issue
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
was
a
transcript
on
appeal
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
all
you
would
have
to
do,
i
suppose
would
--
in
the
instance
of
divorce
is
go
to
married
in
connecticut,
sit
and
watch
the
informal
proceedings
on
which
divorces
are
granted,
present
his
two
witnesses
which
usually
consisted
of
a
mother
and
a
neighbor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
that
case
the
state
of
connecticut
has
provision
for
the
husband
to
be
assessed
for
the
cost
of
providing
counsel.
i
do
not
contend
here
that
counsel
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
your
honor,
i
do
not
contend
that
a
person
without
counsel
is
as
well
equipped
as
a
person
with
counsel
to
litigate
in
court.
all
i
do
contend
is
that
what
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
that
the
person
be
given
an
opportunity
to
get
in
to
court.
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
the
state
go
farther
and
provide
counsel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
which
involves
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
where
a
three-judge
panel
dismissed
appellant's
complaint.
appellants
had
alleged
that
they
are
welfare
recipients
who
seek
to
divorce
their
husbands
in
the
courts
of
connecticut,
but
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
court
costs
imposed
by
the
state
of
connecticut
of
roughly
$60.00.
they
further
alleged
that
the
connecticut
court
officials
had
refused
to
waive
those
costs.
appellant
sought
an
injunction
on
the
basis
that
the
fee
statute
was
unconstitutional,
requesting
the
district
court
to
order
the
connecticut
courts
to
accept
appellant's
divorce
papers
for
filing
and
to
arrange
service
of
process.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
at
the
end
of
march
in
1968
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct
with
at
least
five
of
them
your
honor.
as
to
two
of
the
original
named
plaintiffs,
their
participation
in
this
proceeding
has
been
withdrawn.
before
appearing
here
today,
i
asked
one
of
the
people
attached
to
the
neighborhood
office
where
i
was
formerly
employed
to
check
with
the
appellants
to
make
certain
that
they
are
in
fact
still
interested
in
this
proceeding.
because
of
the
shortage
of
time,
only
four
of
the
remaining
seven
were
contacted,
they
are
still
married
after
a
fashion
and
still
emphatically
undivorced
and
still
unable
to
raise
the
fees
necessary
to
initiate
a
divorce
proceeding
in
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
with
response
to
the
first
or
in
response
to
the
first
question
your
honor,
the
showing
which
was
submitted
to
the
courts
of
connecticut
and
to
the
district
court
consisted
of
affidavits
which
appear
in
the
appendix
in
this
court
indicating
the
family
situation,
the
income
situation,
the
economic
responsibilities
of
the
appellants
and
we
would
argue
clearly
establishing
indigency
at
that
time.
now,
we've
never
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
issue
of
indigency
because
this
case
was
resolved
in
the
district
court
on
the
pleadings
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
district
court,
indigency
was
conceded.
at
the
present
time,
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
updating
that
showing
of
some
two
and
half
years
ago.
i
suppose
if
this
court
were
to
hold
in
favor
of
the
appellants,
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
and
if
that
time
as
to
any
of
the
appellants
in
the
case,
the
state
would
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
their
indigency.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
the
conduct
of
the
appellees
has
denied
the
due
process
rights
specifically
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
and
grievances.
this
is
a
right
which
appears
in
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
into
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
reflected
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
naacp
versus
button,
united
mine
workers
versus
illinois
decision,
railway
train
man
versus
virginia.
the
right
to
petition
as
this
court
has
recognized,
there's
a
fundamental
right
as
long
ago
as
chambers
versus
baltimore
on
ohio
railway.
this
court
said
that
the
right
to
sue
and
defend
in
the
courts
is
the
alternative
of
force
in
an
organized
society,
it
is
the
right
conservative
of
all
other
rights
and
lies
at
the
foundations
of
orderly
government.
since
this
case
was
argued
last
year,
two
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
rendered
which
i
feel
bear
upon
the
position
of
the
appellants,
at
least
with
respect
to
their
due
process
argument.
i
refer
to
sniadach
versus
family
finance
and
goldberg
versus
kelly.
essentially,
both
of
those
cases
held
that
before
the
property
interest
of
a
citizen
can
be
impaired
or
affected
by
state
action,
a
hearing
must
be
a
for
due.
the
appellants
seek
that
very
same
hearing,
and
yet
their
position
is
more
critical
than
that
of
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
in
sniadach
because
in
this
instance,
not
only
have
the
appellants
been
denied
a
prior
hearing
which
was
the
issue
in
sniadach
and
goldberg
but
they
have
been
denied
any
hearing
at
all.
they
have
simply
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
divorce
in
the
courts
of
connecticut.
for
this
reason,
appellants
maintain
their
right
to
due
process
has
been
denied
of
equal
importance
is
the
other
aspect
of
our
argument
which
relates
to
the
right
to
equal
protection
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
as
long
ago,
as
1941,
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
in
edwards
versus
california
that
the
mere
state
of
being
without
funds
is
a
neutral
fact
constitutionally
and
irrelevant,
like
race,
creed
or
color.
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
poverty,
like
race
is
a
suspect
criteria,
and
when
a
state
discriminates
among
its
citizens
upon
the
basis
of
poverty,
then
it
must
make
the
same
showing
to
justify
that
discrimination
as
would
be
required
if
the
discrimination
were
racial.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
your
honor,
if
a
demonstration
were
made
that
in
point
of
fact,
they
could
not
afford
that
fee,
and
the
reason
is
simply
this;
although
a
dog
license
for
example
may
not
affect
the
matter
of
constitutional
import,
this
court
is
said
that
marriage
appropriation
are
basic
civil
liberties
of
man,
and
i
refer
to
loving
versus
virginia,
skinner
versus
oklahoma
and
griswold
versus
connecticut.
and
so,
the
appellant's
position
would
be
that
whenever
a
fee
is
attached
to
a
state
franchised
activity
which
is
of
constitutional
magnitude,
then
that
fee
must
be
waived
on
behalf
of
an
indigent.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
within
limitations,
correct.
we're
primarily
concerned
or
we're
particularly
concerned
about
divorce
in
this
case
because
it
carries
with
it
the
right
to
marry
or
re-marry
i
should
say.
the
right
to
procreate
with
someone
other
than
the
present
spouse,
so
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
divorce
and
marriage
are
very
closely
linked.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
legal
structure
of
connecticut
and
of
most
states
is
such
that
divorce
carries
with
it
the
right
to
re-marry.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
i
would
not.
at
least
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
draw
the
line
with
respect
the
constitutionally
protected
interest.
for
example,
we
are
here
and
not
talking
simply
about
divorce.
we
are
here
talking
about
the
right
to
access
to
the
courts.
the
first
amendment
speaks
about
this
specifically.
it
says
nothing
about
fishing
licenses
or
dog
licenses.
you
asked
me
a
moment
ago
about
marriage.
this
court
has
said
that
marriage
is
a
basic
civil
liberty.
taking
that
statement
as
a
given
at
accepting
it,
then
i
would
argue
further
that
conditioning
a
basic
civil
liberty
on
the
ability
to
pay
for
it
is
an
impermissible
state
regulation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
are
some.
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
right.
i
suppose
the
distinction
which
becomes
important
is
the
distinction,
let
us
say,
between
shapiro
versus
thompson
on
the
one
hand,
and
williams
versus
dandridge
on
the
other.
in
williams
versus
dandridge,
maximum
grants
were
upheld
in
welfare
cases
by
this
court.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
in
welfare
cases,
residency
restrictions
were
stricken
down.
the
difference
was
not
that
they
weren't
rights
or
interests
in
both
cases,
but
that
the
right
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
was
deemed
to
be
a
constitutional
right,
the
right
of
free
travel
in
the
united
states.
whereas
in
williams
versus
dandridge,
the
majority
of
this
court
concluded
that
although
there
were
interests
being
affected
by
the
state's
economic
regulation.
they
were
not
of
constitutional
dimension
and
as
a
consequence,
the
showing
by
the
state
of
a
reasonable
purpose
for
regulation
was
sufficient
to
justify
maximum
grants.
i
don't
know
if
this
is
responsive,
but
it
would
be
the
distinction
which
i
would
draw
for
example
between
access
to
the
courts
and
the
fishing
license.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
not
if
he
is
indigent
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
believe
so.
we
at
least
want
the
same
protection
that
is
afforded
in
criminal
cases
as
to
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
we
would
not
go
beyond
that
and
maintain
that
the
criminal
protections
for
example,
involving
appointed
counsel
are
necessary
in
civil
cases,
and
there
are
number
of
distinctions
which
are
relevant.
for
example
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
with
respect
to
the
appeal,
who
would
take
care
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
the
state
could
make
a
showing
that
the
costs
were
necessary
to
maintaining
the
appellate
system.
then,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
that
it
could
require
appellate
cost
of
an
indigent.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
-
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
agree.
one
of
the
positions
which
the
appellants
have
maintained
in
their
brief
is
that
the
justification
offered
by
the
state
for
imposing
cost
on
indigents
simply
is
inadequate
for
the
burden
that
results.
for
example,
in
terms
of
producing
revenues,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
require
that
revenues
be
generated
by
the
poor
who
simply
are
unable
to
produce
them
or
to
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
yet
your
honor
in
roughly
half
of
the
states,
the
very
same
type
of
informa
pauperis
litigation
which
we
are
arguing
for
today
is
provided
as
a
matter
of
statute,
and
yet
those
states
and
their
court
systems
don't
seem
to
be
crumbling
under
the
burden.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
have
not
surveyed
the
exact
dimensions
of
these
provisions,
but
at
least
as
to
some
of
the
states,
the
door
is
that
wide
open,
that
is
an
indigent
may
simply
file
an
action.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
think
that
it
could
do
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
think
that
he
is
your
honor.
now,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
certainly
is
that,
but
they
may
also
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state.
legitimately
to
regulate
certain
types
of
activities
and
they
may
also
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
impose
licensing
fees,
examination
fees,
investigation
fees,
and
the
like.
i'm
thinking
specifically
of
the
$200.00
i'm
going
to
have
to
be
paying
to
the
arizona
bar
association
within
the
next
few
months.
but
the
situation
here
is
dramatically
different
because
these
appellants
are
seeking
to
exercise
a
right
which
specifically
protected
by
the
constitution
which
has
body
in
the
first
amendment.
the
right
of
a
plumber,
i
suppose
is
assured
by
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
is
against
arbitrary
or
capricious
discrimination,
but
the
right
of
a
person
to
go
into
court
is
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote
or
the
right
of
a
person
to
exercise
free
speech
or
engage
in
political
activity.
and
as
to
these
before
the
state
can
impair
these
rights,
it
must
demonstrate
a
compelling
necessity
for
the
regulation
which
it
seeks
to
impose.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
certainly
does
that
your
honor.
but
in
this
instance,
the
regulation
involved,
imposing
a
fee
upon
indigents.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
does
not
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
but
the
only
aspect
of
the
fee
system
which
is
being
challenged
here
today
is
that
which
operates
against
indigents
and
bars
them
from
the
courts.
the
regulation
which
is
involved
is
not
particularly
well
calculated
to
save
the
family,
since
it
applies
to
all
types
of
litigation.
in
addition
of
course,
the
courts
of
connecticut
have
spoken
with
respect
to
divorce.
they
have
said
that
divorce
is
permissible,
is
authorized
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
if
grounds
are
shown,
and
yet,
the
state
has
gone
farther
and
said
we
don't
mean
that's
with
respect
the
poor
because
as
to
them,
we
attach
a
further
condition.
the
condition
that
they
cannot
get
a
divorce
unless
they
somehow
aggregate
their
condition
of
poverty.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc
circuit
in
parks
versus
parks
cited
in
our
last
brief
which
we
filed
with
this
court
noted
that,
if
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
addition
to
the
requirements
which
congress
has
imposed
for
showing,
for
obtaining
a
divorce.
if
there
were
a
further
requirement
that
only
the
wealthy
or
the
affluent
could
obtain
divorces.
then
there
would
be
issues
of
serious
constitutional
dimension
raised,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
the
case
which
was
contemplated
by
that
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
except
that
the
effect
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
in
the
things
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
suppose
that
if
that
person
would
like
to
change
places
in
light
with
gladys
boddie.
she
would
be
very
happy
to
meet
and
then
change
place
with
him.
i
don't
mean
that
entirely
facetiously,
because
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
obligation
upon
the
state
to
equalize
all
of
the
inequities
of
life.
but
what
we
do
contend
here
is
that
the
state,
when
it
creates
a
right
or
in
this
instance,
when
it
forces
a
person
to
come
to
it
to
resolve
that
person's
affairs.
it
cannot
create
new
inequities.
it
cannot
impose
requirements
which
i
suppose
life
itself
does
not
impose.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
like
that
in
williams
versus
illinois,
decided
in
june
of
this
past
year,
where
a
person
who
could
not
pay
a
fine
was
required
to
work
it
off
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
this
court
said
that
on
its
face,
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
equitable
statute,
except
that
in
operation
for
the
poor,
it
met
an
invidious
discrimination.
now,
i
suppose
that
a
prisoner
in
illinois
might
appear
someday
before
this
court
and
make
the
same
argument
that
could
be
made
with
respect
to
gladys
boddie
that
is
that
the
indigent
are
receiving
preferential
treatment,
but
the
thrust
of
this
case
is
not
that.
it
is
simply
that
the
state
cannot
discriminate
against
the
poor
in
structuring
its
legal
system.
with
respect
to
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
arguments
which
appellants
have
submitted
to
this
court.
i
suspect
that
the
comments
i've
made
by
this
time
are
at
least
a
survey
of
our
position.
there's
one
other
aspect
of
our
position
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to,
and
that
is
the
arguments
or
that
is
with
reference
to
the
arguments
which
the
state
has
put
forward
to
justify
its
fee
system.
the
fee
system
does
not
deter
frivolous
litigation
or
if
it
does,
it
does
so
only
with
respect
to
the
poor
and
as
to
them,
it
deters
all
litigation.
it
does
not
provide
revenues,
at
least
not
from
the
poor
because
they
aren't
able
to
pay
the
fees.
it
does
not
particularly
or
at
least
measurably
conserve
revenue
or
facilities
or
services
in
the
court
system.
and
even
if
it
did,
it
has
never
been
held
or
believed
to
my
knowledge
that
that
cost
of
constitutionally
imposed
burdens
relieves
the
states
from
fulfilling
those
--
their
duties
under
those
burdens.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
this
court
said
that
we
recognized
that
if
state
has
a
valid
interest
in
preserving
the
physical
integrity
of
its
programs.
but
a
state
may
not
accomplish
such
a
purpose
by
invidious
discrimination
between
classes
of
its
citizens.
it
could
not
for
example,
reduce
its
expenditures
for
school
by
barring
indigent
children,
and
yet
the
state
of
connecticut
is
attempting
to
reduce
its
expenditures
for
courts
by
barring
indigent
litigants.
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
enough
for
the
appellees
to
show
a
mere
rational
basis
for
the
fee
system
which
operates
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
must
show
more
of
compelling
necessity
for
imposing
court
fees
upon
the
poor.
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
which
i
just
quoted
from
said
in
essence
that
only
a
compelling
necessity
could
justify
discriminating
among
citizens
on
suspect
criteria
such
as
poverty
or
race,
and
discriminating
in
a
manner
which
affects
important
rights
such
as
the
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
below
to
give
the
relief
which
appellants
seek.
and
in
so
doing,
we
have
maintained
in
the
last
brief
which
we
submitted
to
this
court
that
a
holding
in
favor
appellants
can
be
narrowly
based
and
narrowly
limited
in
its
implications.
this
case
involves
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
it
involves
litigation
concerning
matters
of
constitutional
magnitude
marriage
appropriation.
further,
it
involves
matters
which
cannot
be
settled
privately.
the
state
of
connecticut
has
said
to
these
appellants
that
they
cannot
resolve
their
affairs
privately.
they
must
go
into
state
courts
to
seek
the
relief
they
need,
and
yet
at
the
same
time,
has
barred
them
from
those
courts.
a
holding
emphasizing
these
factors,
for
example,
would
not
compel
a
later
holding
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
civil
cases
or
a
later
holding
that
fees
for
the
use
of
golf
greens
in
a
public
golf
course
must
be
waived
for
the
poor.
a
useful
analog
for
this
case
is
goldberg
versus
kelly
where
this
court
considered
the
meaning
of
due
process
in
welfare
termination
cases
and
concluded
that
a
hearing
is
the
essence
of
due
process.
but
that
appointment
of
counsel
may
not
be
required.
in
conclusion,
then
we
ask
this
court
to
grant
the
relief
for
appellants
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
i
would
suppose
that
in
many
if
not
most
aspects
of
civil
litigation.
it
would
be
useful
perhaps
necessary
to
have
an
attorney.
but
a
holding
in
this
case
would
not
compel
a
later
holding
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
civil
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
because
in
this
case,
we
are
relying
upon
the
specific
first
amendment
guarantee
of
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
there
is
no
such
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
take
it
that
the
first
amendment
and
speaking
about
the
right
to
petition
is
speaking
about
access
to
the
courts
or
to
government.
it
would
always
remain
true
that
the
fruits
of
that
access
inherently
will
be
unequal.
now
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
might
want
to
go
farther
and
to
hold
that
for
example,
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
certain
types
of
civil
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
think
a
holding
of
that
nature
as
to
courts
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
now,
when
i
say
that,
what
i
have
in
mind
are
the
kinds
of
considerations
this
court
had
in
mind
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
in
saying
that
due
process
must
be
afforded
at
some
point
by
the
state
whether
it
be
in
what
is
called
an
administrative
hearing
or
what
is
called
the
court.
but
the
functions
of
courts
must
be
performed
and
they
must
be
performed
equally
at
least
open
equally
to
the
rich
and
then
the
poor
alike.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
they
must
pay
the
costs
if
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
think
that
argument
carries
that
far,
if
i
understand
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
correctly.
well,
the
argument
which
i'm
making
today,
i
don't
think
compels
anyone
to
go
that
far
anytime.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
do.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
are
several
reasons.
first,
i
would
argue
that
the
availability
of
other
sources
is
irrelevant
to
whether
or
not
these
appellants
have
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
into
a
court
of
connecticut
and
file
a
proceeding
without
having
to
pay
for
sanctions,
for
fees
which
that
state
court
has
imposed
upon
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
now
secondly,
with
respect
to
that,
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear
that
the
state
of
connecticut
will
not
provide
those
funds
on
request.
i
must
say
that,
i
personally
resent
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
as
an
attorney,
mr.
cannon
is
going
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
the
fashion
in
which
he
did
because
for
example,
there
is
no
program
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
will
provide
court
fees
to
indigent
litigants
upon
request.
there
is
only
one
program
in
which
the
state
of
connecticut
is
at
all
involved,
and
that
is
a
pilot
program
serving
a
small
section
of
middle
town
in
the
county
around
it.
for
the
rest
of
the
state
and
i
might
add
for
the
rest
of
the
nation,
people
going
to
legal
services
programs
cannot
get
into
court
unless
their
program
is
fortunate
about
to
have
excess
funds
or
a
budget
item
which
allows
for
payment
of
fees.
the
haven
legal
assistance
is
one
of
the
few
programs
in
the
country
to
my
knowledge
which
over
the
years
has
had
some
funds
available
for
payment
of
court
fees.
there
are
limited
funds,
they're
insufficient.
but
more
importantly,
if
a
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
into
a
court,
he
should
not
have
to
go
begging
or
soliciting
or
his
attorney
should
not
have
to
go
soliciting
to
charitable
voluntary
ad
hoc
agencies
or
governmental
programs
for
something
which
the
state
of
connecticut
is
obligated
to
provide.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
so
that
i
maintain
that
mr.
cannon's
argument
or
at
least
the
burden
of
it
missed
the
point
of
this
appeal
which
is
that
these
appellants
don't
have
to
go
to
charitable
organizations
which
may
or
may
not
have
funds
to
get
something
which
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
point
which
mr.
cannon
i
guess
was
arguing.
new
haven
legal
assistance
does
not
have
the
funds
for
these
appellants.
if
they
did,
i
would
never
have
started
this
case.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
did.
your
honor,
these
cases
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
state
of
connecticut
has
not
fund.
there
is
no
source
for
these
fees.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
fund
that
he
is
talking
about
to
the
extent,
i
understood
it;
related
to
a
small
fund
from
the
welfare
department,
for
a
pilot
project
in
middle
town
jointly
funded
with
hew.
it
has
no
bearing
on
these
appellants
or
on
the
rest
of
the
state.
the
allegations
and
the
affidavits
in
this
record
remain
unchallenged
and
they
remain
true
that
there
is
no
place
for
these
appellants
to
go.
now,
if
this
court
is
concerned
about
the
present
financial
status
of
these
appellants,
i
will
be
happy
to
submit
affidavits
to
this
court
to
persuade
it
that
this
case
is
still
alive
and
not
moot.
but
remanding
this
case
after
these
applications
sat
in
my
office
for
six
month
and
after
this
case
is
taken
two
and
a
half
years,
i
submit
would
be
cruel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
first
of
course,
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
but
if
they
did
do
that
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
there
is
such
a
regulation
or
such
a
program,
mr.
cannon
has
to
have
two
and
a
half
years
to
refer
it
in
his
brief.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
object
in
the
posture
of
this
case
which
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
for
two-and-a-half
years
and
the
state
has
never
once
documented
the
argument
which
it
has
made
more
or
less
for
the
first
time
today.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
fact
that
the
state
has
not
raised
any
reference
to
any
program
or
regulation
indicates
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
you
found
it,
then
i
would
suggest
that's
possibly
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
it
were
a
program
clearly
available
to
these
appellants.
then
perhaps
it
might
moot
this
appeal
and
perhaps
then
a
remand
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
mean
an
official
program
-
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
would
not
your
honor.
these
appellants
don't
have
to
go
to
charities
to
seek
what
is
a
constitutional
right.
now
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
i
will
provide
them
within
two
weeks
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
like
the
opportunity
to
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
those
your
honor.
i
feel
strongly
that
this
case
should
not
be
remanded.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
padnos
closed
by
saying
that
when
he
sought
was
the
opportunity
to
get
into
court.
i
might
begin
by
saying
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
appellant
seek
in
this
case.
the
appellants
initiated
this
proceeding
by
bringing
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut.
they
allege
in
their
complaint
that
they
wished,
intended
to
sue
their
husbands
for
divorce
in
the
connecticut
superior
courts,
but
that
is
welfare
recipients
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
court
cost
of
approximately
$60.00
or
more.
as
a
consequence,
they
had
set
their
divorce
papers
to
the
superior
court
for
new
haven
county,
with
applications
asking
that
court
to
waive
the
filing
fees
and
to
arrange
service
of
process.
these
papers
where
all
set
back
by
the
clerk
of
that
court.
upon
received
of
these
papers,
appellants
then
asked
superior
court
judge
longo
and
after
speaking
with
him,
the
state
supreme
court
administrator
justice
carter
to
reverse
the
position
which
had
been
taken
by
the
superior
court
clerk
edward
orimits.
they
sustained
that
position
and
as
a
consequence,
appellants
were
effectively
bard
from
access
to
the
courts
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
further
alleged
in
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
that
this
denied
them
constitutional
rights
involving
due
process
and
equal
protection.
the
appellee
is
moved
to
dismiss
their
motion
with
sustain
by
a
--
or
granted
by
a
three-judge-panel
and
this
direct
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court.
the
question
which
is
thus
presented
is
has
connecticut
by
erecting
economic
barriers
to
its
court
denied
these
appellants
the
rights
to
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
laws
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
if
i
may
turn
first
to
our
due
process
contention,
we
founded
upon
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
a
right
which
is
expressed
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
which
is
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth.
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
naacp
versus
button,
united
mine
workers
versus
the
brotherhood
of
railway
engineers
and
the
united
mine
workers
--
i'm
sorry,
the
united
mine
workers
versus
illinois
bar
association
and
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman
versus
virginia,
all
of
these
cases
are
squarely
precedent
for
this.
the
appellees
may
attempt
to
distinguish
them
on
the
ground
that
the
litigation
contemplated
in
button
was
of
a
political
nature
whereas
the
litigation
appellants
contemplate
is
of
a
personal
nature,
but
that
distinction
was
rejected
in
the
mine
worker's
case;
a
second
distinction
maybe
that
these
cases
involved
the
right
of
assembly
rather
than
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances,
but
we
submit
that
the
language
of
these
three
cases
discusses
these
two
rights
independently
and
accords
to
them
equal
status.
the
right
of
assembly
and
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
indeed
in
these
cases,
their
would
hardly
have
been
any
point
to
assembly
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
to
unable
individuals
as
here
to
bring
suits
on
their
on
behalf.
this
is
a
fundamental
right.
this
court
has
said
that
the
right
sue
and
defend
in
the
courts
is
the
alternative
of
force
in
an
organize
society.
it
is
the
right
conservative
of
all
other
rights
and
lies
at
the
foundations
of
orderly
government.
turning
to
our
equal
protection
contention,
it
is
clear
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
can
be
denied
by
economic
discrimination
as
surely
as
racial
discrimination.
this
court
recognized
that
in
edwards
versus
california
in
1941
and
as
reaffirmed
it
in
many
decisions
sense
most
recently
in
mcdonald
versus
board
of
elections.
perhaps
the
most
significant
case
here
is
griffin
versus
illinois
where
this
court
held
that
appellant
remedies
could
not
be
denied
to
a
person
convicted
of
crime
simply
because
of
its
inability
to
purchase
a
transcript
for
appeal.
appellees
brief
at
great
length
has
attempted
to
distinguish
griffin
from
this
case.
appellees
have
set
first
that
griffin
is
a
criminal
case
and
that
this
is
a
civil
case,
the
present
proceeding.
and
point
of
fact,
however,
this
is
a
distinction
which
is
not
recognized
by
the
constitution
appears
no
where
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
was
not
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
that
decision
dealt
not
with
criminal
procedure,
but
with
court
procedure,
and
it
is
court
procedure
which
these
appellants
seek
to
pursue.
a
second
distinction
offered
in
their
brief
by
appellees
is
that
in
griffin,
liberty
was
involved
whereas
these
appellants
are
at
large
to
go
about
as
they
choose.
but
in
point
of
fact,
the
liberty
of
these
appellants
is
substantially
curd
by
their
inability
to
obtain
divorces
in
the
courts
of
connecticut
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
liberty
consist
of
more
than
simply
freedom
from
physical
restraint.
a
final
point
which
appellees
have
made
in
their
brief
is
that
griffin
should
not
govern
here
because
in
griffin,
the
state
was
the
participating
adversary.
it
was
the
state
which
had
put
mr.
griffin
in
custody
whereas
the
divorce
actions
contemplated
by
appellants
are
private
matters
between
husband
and
wife.
this
however
is
an
elusory
distinction.
it
is
the
state
which
has
bard
these
appellants
from
its
courts.
it
is
the
state
which
has
said
to
these
appellants
that
they
may
not
settle
their
marital
affairs
out
of
the
court.
thus
on
the
one
hand,
the
state
has
required
these
appellants
to
go
in
the
court
and
at
the
same
time
has
told
them
that
they
may
not
do
so.
we
submit
then
that
the
state
is
fully
as
much
as
an
adversary
in
this
proceeding
at
it
was
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
certainly
one
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
know
if
any
legal
proceeding
in
connecticut
which
would
extend
to
these
appellants
half
the
divorce
for
one
third
or
one
fourths.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
sums
are
accurate.
i
would
not
characterize
them
as
minimum
--
minimal
nor
with
my
clients.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
a
routine
divorce
of
case
would
cost
approximately
$60.00
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
suppose
this
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
let
me
first
say
that
this
court
could
draw
a
distinction
between
this
type
of
case
and
a
case
which
involves
purely
personal
private
issues,
a
negligence,
suit
or
contract
suit
are
examples
of
litigation
which
does
not
involved
with
state
in
the
same
fashion
that
a
criminal
prosecution
does
or
divorce
prosecution
--
pardon
me,
a
divorce
suit
does.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
connecticut,
a
baster
the
proceeding
involves
the
state
rather
extensively.
i
don't
know
about
other
states.
i
would
not
urge
this
distinction
upon
the
court.
the
court
of
course
is
free
to
adapt
it.
what
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
is
simply
this
that
anytime
the
states,
where
it
be
the
state
of
connecticut
or
any
other
state
creates
a
state
remedy
through
its
courts.
i
submit
that
that
the
remedy
must
be
available
to
the
poor
and
the
wealthy
alike
whether
it
involved
negligence,
divorce,
bastardy
or
whatever.
i
would
note
that
are
some
limitations
on
the
reach
of
reasoning.
the
appellees
have
noted
that
this
reasoning
would
carry
over
to
dog
licenses,
road
tolls
and
whatever.
i
contend
that
it
is
not.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
constitutional
right,
the
access
to
the
courts
maybe
deny
by
economic
barriers.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
dog
license
or
i
supposed
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
to
passage
through
a
road
toll
station.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
the
right
to
travel
were
totally
bard
by
a
state
by
toll
stations,
then
i
would
submit
that
the
person
who
he
is
thus
bard
has
a
constitutional
claim.
in
thompson
versus
shapiro
would
be
as
good
as
citation
for
that
as
any,
so
with
edwards
versus
california.
but
i
did
not
understand
that
was
the
argument
being
made
by
the
appellees.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
involved
as
they
clearly
is
here,
then
perhaps
this
court
might
distinguish
future
litigation
from
present
litigation.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
do
they
have
a
lawyer?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
they
do.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
oh
i'm
sorry,
no.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
must.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
the
right
to
access
to
the
courts
is
clearly
provided
for
in
the
constitution
by
express
provision.
there
is
no
similar
provision
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
civil
cases
or
for
appointment
of
expert
assistance.
so
in
constitutional
contemplation,
there
is
a
distinction
between
access
to
the
courts
and
appointment
of
counsel.
in
point
of
fact
also
there
is
a
distinction.
once
in
court,
a
litigate
has
an
opportunity
to
obtain
justice
given
a
reasonably
compassionate
judge
and
a
reasonably
good
case
and
affirm
amount
of
intelligence.
we
have
those
in
reasonable
abundance
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
but
if
bard
from
court,
if
her
papers
are
simply
set
back
by
the
clerk
of
court
without
any
consideration,
there's
no
opportunity
to
obtain
justice
at
all.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
submit
that
she
does
not
have
to
pay
the
court
cost
incident
to
an
appeal.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
she
might
have
to
retain
her
own
counsel
if
she
desired
counsel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
she
cannot
afford
it
--
the
--
i
supposed
one
other
factor
which
is
worth
noting
and
that
is
that
the
prevalence
of
legal
services
programs
and
the
availability
of
legal
services
attorneys
take
some
of
the
urgency
out
of
the
concern
for
availability
of
counsel.
it
does
not
relieve
the
urgency
which
is
behind
the
issues
raised
by
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
well
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
terms
of
whether
the
absence
of
a
reference
to
appeal
by
the
constitution
in
griffin
case
in
terms
of
whether
that
therefore
would
require
compelling
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
civil
cases,
i
would
only
respond
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
a
matter
which
in
criminal
cases
specifically
provided
for
and
the
absence
of
reference
to
civil
cases
could
justify
this
court
and
inferring
that
the
drafters
of
the
constitution
did
not
contemplate
appointing
counsel
in
civil
cases.
now,
i
have
somewhat
handicap
in
arguing
a
case
which
i'm
not
bringing,
but
i
do
submit
that
if
that
cases
brought
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
a
civil
case,
this
court
might
well
be
justified
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
arguments
which
would
be
submitted
at
a
later
time.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
you
might
well
say
that
or
you
might
say
only
an
important
civil
cases,
defining
that
in
various
ways.
the
problem
here
is
not
much
different
from
the
problem
which
this
court
is
cope
with
for
exampling
gideon
versus
wainwrigth
in
determining
of
whether
counsel
must
be
appointed
only
felony
cases
or
in
misdemeanor
cases
determining
the
limit
of
the
appointment
requirements
of
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
on
this
court's
rulings
in
loving
versus
virginia,
skinner
versus
oklahoma,
i
would
say
that
the
state
would
be
required
to
raise
--
i'm
sorry
waive
that
filling
fee
in
application
for
marriage
if
the
applicants
establish
they
could
not
pay
fee
and
if
the
state
could
not
show
a
legitimate
basis
for
imposing
the
fee.
now,
i
say
that
with
the
important
emphasis
that
what
is
involved
is
a
fundamental
right
in
marriage
according
to
this
court's
decisions,
and
i
would
therefore
distinguish
this
from
a
dog
license
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
or
perhaps
a
hunting
license.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes
and
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
right
to
work
would
then
raise
the
economic
considerations
which
might
be
to
a
conclusion
that
equal
protection
have
been
denied
the
right
to
travel
in
itself
would
be
a
constitutional
consideration
and
protected
by
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth,
the
first
amendment
providing
for
a
right
of
assembly
and
a
right
to
petition
the
courts
for
redress
the
fourteenth.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
as
i
read
this
court's
opinions
in
the
mine
worker's
case
and
in
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman
case,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
involves
both
private
and
official
grievances.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
button
case
was
primarily
focused
upon
official
grievances
in
the
sense
that
the
group
there
was
involved
with
advancing
the
political
social
interest
of
a
minority
group
which
was
being
impressed
--
discriminating
against.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
button;
that
is
true
but
in
the
mine
worker's
case
and
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainman,
the
litigation
contemplated
was
for
private
gain,
for
individual
benefit.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
under
our
first
due
process
argument,
i'm
saying
that
the
states
must
afford
the
opportunity
to
come
in
to
court
and
raised
a
claim.
the
state
may
not
provide
redress
for
the
claim,
but
it
must
at
least
provide
an
opportunity
to
petition
for
redress.
under
our
equal
protection
argument,
i
am
saying
that
where
the
state
provides
a
cause
of
action
or
a
remedy,
it
must
provide
equally.
now
it
happens
that
the
state
of
connecticut
provides
for
divorce.
given
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
say
to
the
appellants
that
they
may
not
come
into
court
and
ask
for
divorce,
norm
that
it
may
have
say
to
appellants
that
divorce
is
available
to
everybody
excepting
the
poor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
two
arguments
are
quite
close.
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
significance
of
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
in
this
case
comes
about
because
of
this
court's
decisions
of
such
cases
as
shapiro
versus
thompson
in
which
the
court
had
said
that
in
order
to
justify
racial
discrimination
or
economic
discrimination
as
legitimate
legislative
policy,
a
state
must
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
necessity
for
that
discrimination.
it
may
not
show
simply
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
it,
there
must
a
compelling
necessity.
we
of
course
submit
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
such
necessity.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
do
not
conceive
that.
i
maintain
that
the
state
has
taken
two
entirely
different
types
of
action
against
these
appellants:
first,
the
procedural
action
of
barding
them
from
its
court
by
imposing
economic
barriers;
secondly,
the
anacidence
substantive
action
of
requiring
that
the
appellants
go
into
court
in
order
to
settle
their
marital
status.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
but
you
didn't
--
but
didn't
start
a
suit
attacking
the
statutes
which
might
then
be
a
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
revolving
on
you
from
the
state?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
at
connecticut
law
provides
for
that,
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
or
waived
the
publication
if
that
were
consistent
with
due
process
requirements
or
provide
for
alternative
means
of
service
or
notice.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
quite
frankly,
i'm
not
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
well,
i'm
simply
not
familiar
with
annulment
procedure.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
without
--
i
would
assume
that
my
arguments
would
extend
to
that
as
well
as
to
divorce.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
two
or
three
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
it
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
you're
appropriate,
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
let
me
pick
up
mr.
chief
justice
three
points
right
quickly.
the
first
is
that
mr.
cannon
had
suggested
that
the
appellant
should
have
bought
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
connecticut
so
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
rule
property
on
the
issues
imposed
in
this
case.
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
submitted
an
application
to
superior
court
for
new
haven
county
and
then
pursued
it
to
the
administrator
of
the
court's
of
state
of
connecticut
who
is
a
supreme
court
justice.
not
only
where
we
not
given
an
opportunity
to
present
this
issue
and
argue
it,
our
papers
were
simply
sent
back.
now
for
failure
to
pay
the
filing
fees,
if
we
have
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
the
same
filing
fees
would
have
been
required
and
our
papers
presumably
there
would
have
been
set
back.
we
did
make
the
attempt
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
the
$45.00
--
i
would
have
to
check
the
statutes
again
your
honor,
but
there
is
certainly
an
entry
fee
attached
to
all
proceedings
brought
the
superior
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
believe
so.
there
is
a
flat
$45.00
entry
fee
required
for
filling
proceedings.
there
are
some
exceptions
as
mr.
cannon
noted,
but
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
i
do
not
believe
would
be
one
of
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
service
with
me
in
addition
to
the
$45.00
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
pick
up
quickly
is
simply
that
there
is
no
justification
in
connecticut
for
imposing
this
requirement
of
filing
fees.
it
does
not
discourage
frivolous
litigation.
the
wealthy
can
bring
that
litigation
if
they
choose
to
do
so.
what
is
achieved
by
these
filing
requirements
is
that
the
poor
may
not
bring
frivolous
litigation.
we
submit
that
this
letter
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
assumed
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
does
ssumed
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
bring
on
behalf
of
the
poor
the
same
of
kind
of
litigation
which
the
wealthy
can
bring.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
perhaps,
i
should
--
well,
i
will
argue
that
but
i
would
also
contend
that
the
fee
requirement
in
connecticut
has
the
further
affect
of
discouraging
meritorious
litigation
by
the
court.
in
other
words,
it
bards
all
litigation
by
the
poor
whether
frivolous
or
not.
and
that
is
a
consequence
which
we
feel
that
constitutional
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry,
am
i
contending
that?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
because
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
require
a
person
to
come
in
to
court
with
a
lawyer.
it
requires
a
person
to
come
in
to
court
with
the
money
to
pay
filing
fees.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
case
on
which
i
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
griffin
issue
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
was
a
transcript
on
appeal
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
all
you
would
have
to
do,
i
suppose
would
--
in
the
instance
of
divorce
is
go
to
married
in
connecticut,
sit
and
watch
the
informal
proceedings
on
which
divorces
are
granted,
present
his
two
witnesses
which
usually
consisted
of
a
mother
and
a
neighbor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
that
case
the
state
of
connecticut
has
provision
for
the
husband
to
be
assessed
for
the
cost
of
providing
counsel.
i
do
not
contend
here
that
counsel
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
your
honor,
i
do
not
contend
that
a
person
without
counsel
is
as
well
equipped
as
a
person
with
counsel
to
litigate
in
court.
all
i
do
contend
is
that
what
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
that
the
person
be
given
an
opportunity
to
get
in
to
court.
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
the
state
go
farther
and
provide
counsel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
which
involves
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
where
a
three-judge
panel
dismissed
appellant's
complaint.
appellants
had
alleged
that
they
are
welfare
recipients
who
seek
to
divorce
their
husbands
in
the
courts
of
connecticut,
but
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
court
costs
imposed
by
the
state
of
connecticut
of
roughly
$60.00.
they
further
alleged
that
the
connecticut
court
officials
had
refused
to
waive
those
costs.
appellant
sought
an
injunction
on
the
basis
that
the
fee
statute
was
unconstitutional,
requesting
the
district
court
to
order
the
connecticut
courts
to
accept
appellant's
divorce
papers
for
filing
and
to
arrange
service
of
process.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
at
the
end
of
march
in
1968
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct
with
at
least
five
of
them
your
honor.
as
to
two
of
the
original
named
plaintiffs,
their
participation
in
this
proceeding
has
been
withdrawn.
before
appearing
here
today,
i
asked
one
of
the
people
attached
to
the
neighborhood
office
where
i
was
formerly
employed
to
check
with
the
appellants
to
make
certain
that
they
are
in
fact
still
interested
in
this
proceeding.
because
of
the
shortage
of
time,
only
four
of
the
remaining
seven
were
contacted,
they
are
still
married
after
a
fashion
and
still
emphatically
undivorced
and
still
unable
to
raise
the
fees
necessary
to
initiate
a
divorce
proceeding
in
connecticut.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
with
response
to
the
first
or
in
response
to
the
first
question
your
honor,
the
showing
which
was
submitted
to
the
courts
of
connecticut
and
to
the
district
court
consisted
of
affidavits
which
appear
in
the
appendix
in
this
court
indicating
the
family
situation,
the
income
situation,
the
economic
responsibilities
of
the
appellants
and
we
would
argue
clearly
establishing
indigency
at
that
time.
now,
we've
never
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
issue
of
indigency
because
this
case
was
resolved
in
the
district
court
on
the
pleadings
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
district
court,
indigency
was
conceded.
at
the
present
time,
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
updating
that
showing
of
some
two
and
half
years
ago.
i
suppose
if
this
court
were
to
hold
in
favor
of
the
appellants,
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
and
if
that
time
as
to
any
of
the
appellants
in
the
case,
the
state
would
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
their
indigency.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
the
conduct
of
the
appellees
has
denied
the
due
process
rights
specifically
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
and
grievances.
this
is
a
right
which
appears
in
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
into
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
reflected
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
naacp
versus
button,
united
mine
workers
versus
illinois
decision,
railway
train
man
versus
virginia.
the
right
to
petition
as
this
court
has
recognized,
there's
a
fundamental
right
as
long
ago
as
chambers
versus
baltimore
on
ohio
railway.
this
court
said
that
the
right
to
sue
and
defend
in
the
courts
is
the
alternative
of
force
in
an
organized
society,
it
is
the
right
conservative
of
all
other
rights
and
lies
at
the
foundations
of
orderly
government.
since
this
case
was
argued
last
year,
two
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
rendered
which
i
feel
bear
upon
the
position
of
the
appellants,
at
least
with
respect
to
their
due
process
argument.
i
refer
to
sniadach
versus
family
finance
and
goldberg
versus
kelly.
essentially,
both
of
those
cases
held
that
before
the
property
interest
of
a
citizen
can
be
impaired
or
affected
by
state
action,
a
hearing
must
be
a
for
due.
the
appellants
seek
that
very
same
hearing,
and
yet
their
position
is
more
critical
than
that
of
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
in
sniadach
because
in
this
instance,
not
only
have
the
appellants
been
denied
a
prior
hearing
which
was
the
issue
in
sniadach
and
goldberg
but
they
have
been
denied
any
hearing
at
all.
they
have
simply
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
divorce
in
the
courts
of
connecticut.
for
this
reason,
appellants
maintain
their
right
to
due
process
has
been
denied
of
equal
importance
is
the
other
aspect
of
our
argument
which
relates
to
the
right
to
equal
protection
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
as
long
ago,
as
1941,
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
in
edwards
versus
california
that
the
mere
state
of
being
without
funds
is
a
neutral
fact
constitutionally
and
irrelevant,
like
race,
creed
or
color.
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
poverty,
like
race
is
a
suspect
criteria,
and
when
a
state
discriminates
among
its
citizens
upon
the
basis
of
poverty,
then
it
must
make
the
same
showing
to
justify
that
discrimination
as
would
be
required
if
the
discrimination
were
racial.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
your
honor,
if
a
demonstration
were
made
that
in
point
of
fact,
they
could
not
afford
that
fee,
and
the
reason
is
simply
this;
although
a
dog
license
for
example
may
not
affect
the
matter
of
constitutional
import,
this
court
is
said
that
marriage
appropriation
are
basic
civil
liberties
of
man,
and
i
refer
to
loving
versus
virginia,
skinner
versus
oklahoma
and
griswold
versus
connecticut.
and
so,
the
appellant's
position
would
be
that
whenever
a
fee
is
attached
to
a
state
franchised
activity
which
is
of
constitutional
magnitude,
then
that
fee
must
be
waived
on
behalf
of
an
indigent.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
within
limitations,
correct.
we're
primarily
concerned
or
we're
particularly
concerned
about
divorce
in
this
case
because
it
carries
with
it
the
right
to
marry
or
re-marry
i
should
say.
the
right
to
procreate
with
someone
other
than
the
present
spouse,
so
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
divorce
and
marriage
are
very
closely
linked.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
legal
structure
of
connecticut
and
of
most
states
is
such
that
divorce
carries
with
it
the
right
to
re-marry.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
no,
i
would
not.
at
least
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
draw
the
line
with
respect
the
constitutionally
protected
interest.
for
example,
we
are
here
and
not
talking
simply
about
divorce.
we
are
here
talking
about
the
right
to
access
to
the
courts.
the
first
amendment
speaks
about
this
specifically.
it
says
nothing
about
fishing
licenses
or
dog
licenses.
you
asked
me
a
moment
ago
about
marriage.
this
court
has
said
that
marriage
is
a
basic
civil
liberty.
taking
that
statement
as
a
given
at
accepting
it,
then
i
would
argue
further
that
conditioning
a
basic
civil
liberty
on
the
ability
to
pay
for
it
is
an
impermissible
state
regulation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
are
some.
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
right.
i
suppose
the
distinction
which
becomes
important
is
the
distinction,
let
us
say,
between
shapiro
versus
thompson
on
the
one
hand,
and
williams
versus
dandridge
on
the
other.
in
williams
versus
dandridge,
maximum
grants
were
upheld
in
welfare
cases
by
this
court.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
in
welfare
cases,
residency
restrictions
were
stricken
down.
the
difference
was
not
that
they
weren't
rights
or
interests
in
both
cases,
but
that
the
right
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
was
deemed
to
be
a
constitutional
right,
the
right
of
free
travel
in
the
united
states.
whereas
in
williams
versus
dandridge,
the
majority
of
this
court
concluded
that
although
there
were
interests
being
affected
by
the
state's
economic
regulation.
they
were
not
of
constitutional
dimension
and
as
a
consequence,
the
showing
by
the
state
of
a
reasonable
purpose
for
regulation
was
sufficient
to
justify
maximum
grants.
i
don't
know
if
this
is
responsive,
but
it
would
be
the
distinction
which
i
would
draw
for
example
between
access
to
the
courts
and
the
fishing
license.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
not
if
he
is
indigent
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
believe
so.
we
at
least
want
the
same
protection
that
is
afforded
in
criminal
cases
as
to
the
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
we
would
not
go
beyond
that
and
maintain
that
the
criminal
protections
for
example,
involving
appointed
counsel
are
necessary
in
civil
cases,
and
there
are
number
of
distinctions
which
are
relevant.
for
example
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
with
respect
to
the
appeal,
who
would
take
care
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
the
state
could
make
a
showing
that
the
costs
were
necessary
to
maintaining
the
appellate
system.
then,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
that
it
could
require
appellate
cost
of
an
indigent.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
-
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
agree.
one
of
the
positions
which
the
appellants
have
maintained
in
their
brief
is
that
the
justification
offered
by
the
state
for
imposing
cost
on
indigents
simply
is
inadequate
for
the
burden
that
results.
for
example,
in
terms
of
producing
revenues,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
require
that
revenues
be
generated
by
the
poor
who
simply
are
unable
to
produce
them
or
to
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
yet
your
honor
in
roughly
half
of
the
states,
the
very
same
type
of
informa
pauperis
litigation
which
we
are
arguing
for
today
is
provided
as
a
matter
of
statute,
and
yet
those
states
and
their
court
systems
don't
seem
to
be
crumbling
under
the
burden.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
have
not
surveyed
the
exact
dimensions
of
these
provisions,
but
at
least
as
to
some
of
the
states,
the
door
is
that
wide
open,
that
is
an
indigent
may
simply
file
an
action.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
think
that
it
could
do
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
think
that
he
is
your
honor.
now,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
certainly
is
that,
but
they
may
also
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state.
legitimately
to
regulate
certain
types
of
activities
and
they
may
also
be
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
impose
licensing
fees,
examination
fees,
investigation
fees,
and
the
like.
i'm
thinking
specifically
of
the
$200.00
i'm
going
to
have
to
be
paying
to
the
arizona
bar
association
within
the
next
few
months.
but
the
situation
here
is
dramatically
different
because
these
appellants
are
seeking
to
exercise
a
right
which
specifically
protected
by
the
constitution
which
has
body
in
the
first
amendment.
the
right
of
a
plumber,
i
suppose
is
assured
by
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
is
against
arbitrary
or
capricious
discrimination,
but
the
right
of
a
person
to
go
into
court
is
as
fundamental
as
the
right
of
a
person
to
vote
or
the
right
of
a
person
to
exercise
free
speech
or
engage
in
political
activity.
and
as
to
these
before
the
state
can
impair
these
rights,
it
must
demonstrate
a
compelling
necessity
for
the
regulation
which
it
seeks
to
impose.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
it
certainly
does
that
your
honor.
but
in
this
instance,
the
regulation
involved,
imposing
a
fee
upon
indigents.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
does
not
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
but
the
only
aspect
of
the
fee
system
which
is
being
challenged
here
today
is
that
which
operates
against
indigents
and
bars
them
from
the
courts.
the
regulation
which
is
involved
is
not
particularly
well
calculated
to
save
the
family,
since
it
applies
to
all
types
of
litigation.
in
addition
of
course,
the
courts
of
connecticut
have
spoken
with
respect
to
divorce.
they
have
said
that
divorce
is
permissible,
is
authorized
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
if
grounds
are
shown,
and
yet,
the
state
has
gone
farther
and
said
we
don't
mean
that's
with
respect
the
poor
because
as
to
them,
we
attach
a
further
condition.
the
condition
that
they
cannot
get
a
divorce
unless
they
somehow
aggregate
their
condition
of
poverty.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc
circuit
in
parks
versus
parks
cited
in
our
last
brief
which
we
filed
with
this
court
noted
that,
if
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
addition
to
the
requirements
which
congress
has
imposed
for
showing,
for
obtaining
a
divorce.
if
there
were
a
further
requirement
that
only
the
wealthy
or
the
affluent
could
obtain
divorces.
then
there
would
be
issues
of
serious
constitutional
dimension
raised,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
the
case
which
was
contemplated
by
that
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
except
that
the
effect
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
in
the
things
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
suppose
that
if
that
person
would
like
to
change
places
in
light
with
gladys
boddie.
she
would
be
very
happy
to
meet
and
then
change
place
with
him.
i
don't
mean
that
entirely
facetiously,
because
i
don't
believe
there
is
an
obligation
upon
the
state
to
equalize
all
of
the
inequities
of
life.
but
what
we
do
contend
here
is
that
the
state,
when
it
creates
a
right
or
in
this
instance,
when
it
forces
a
person
to
come
to
it
to
resolve
that
person's
affairs.
it
cannot
create
new
inequities.
it
cannot
impose
requirements
which
i
suppose
life
itself
does
not
impose.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
like
that
in
williams
versus
illinois,
decided
in
june
of
this
past
year,
where
a
person
who
could
not
pay
a
fine
was
required
to
work
it
off
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
this
court
said
that
on
its
face,
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
equitable
statute,
except
that
in
operation
for
the
poor,
it
met
an
invidious
discrimination.
now,
i
suppose
that
a
prisoner
in
illinois
might
appear
someday
before
this
court
and
make
the
same
argument
that
could
be
made
with
respect
to
gladys
boddie
that
is
that
the
indigent
are
receiving
preferential
treatment,
but
the
thrust
of
this
case
is
not
that.
it
is
simply
that
the
state
cannot
discriminate
against
the
poor
in
structuring
its
legal
system.
with
respect
to
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
arguments
which
appellants
have
submitted
to
this
court.
i
suspect
that
the
comments
i've
made
by
this
time
are
at
least
a
survey
of
our
position.
there's
one
other
aspect
of
our
position
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to,
and
that
is
the
arguments
or
that
is
with
reference
to
the
arguments
which
the
state
has
put
forward
to
justify
its
fee
system.
the
fee
system
does
not
deter
frivolous
litigation
or
if
it
does,
it
does
so
only
with
respect
to
the
poor
and
as
to
them,
it
deters
all
litigation.
it
does
not
provide
revenues,
at
least
not
from
the
poor
because
they
aren't
able
to
pay
the
fees.
it
does
not
particularly
or
at
least
measurably
conserve
revenue
or
facilities
or
services
in
the
court
system.
and
even
if
it
did,
it
has
never
been
held
or
believed
to
my
knowledge
that
that
cost
of
constitutionally
imposed
burdens
relieves
the
states
from
fulfilling
those
--
their
duties
under
those
burdens.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
this
court
said
that
we
recognized
that
if
state
has
a
valid
interest
in
preserving
the
physical
integrity
of
its
programs.
but
a
state
may
not
accomplish
such
a
purpose
by
invidious
discrimination
between
classes
of
its
citizens.
it
could
not
for
example,
reduce
its
expenditures
for
school
by
barring
indigent
children,
and
yet
the
state
of
connecticut
is
attempting
to
reduce
its
expenditures
for
courts
by
barring
indigent
litigants.
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
enough
for
the
appellees
to
show
a
mere
rational
basis
for
the
fee
system
which
operates
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
they
must
show
more
of
compelling
necessity
for
imposing
court
fees
upon
the
poor.
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
which
i
just
quoted
from
said
in
essence
that
only
a
compelling
necessity
could
justify
discriminating
among
citizens
on
suspect
criteria
such
as
poverty
or
race,
and
discriminating
in
a
manner
which
affects
important
rights
such
as
the
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
below
to
give
the
relief
which
appellants
seek.
and
in
so
doing,
we
have
maintained
in
the
last
brief
which
we
submitted
to
this
court
that
a
holding
in
favor
appellants
can
be
narrowly
based
and
narrowly
limited
in
its
implications.
this
case
involves
a
specific
constitutional
guarantee,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
it
involves
litigation
concerning
matters
of
constitutional
magnitude
marriage
appropriation.
further,
it
involves
matters
which
cannot
be
settled
privately.
the
state
of
connecticut
has
said
to
these
appellants
that
they
cannot
resolve
their
affairs
privately.
they
must
go
into
state
courts
to
seek
the
relief
they
need,
and
yet
at
the
same
time,
has
barred
them
from
those
courts.
a
holding
emphasizing
these
factors,
for
example,
would
not
compel
a
later
holding
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
civil
cases
or
a
later
holding
that
fees
for
the
use
of
golf
greens
in
a
public
golf
course
must
be
waived
for
the
poor.
a
useful
analog
for
this
case
is
goldberg
versus
kelly
where
this
court
considered
the
meaning
of
due
process
in
welfare
termination
cases
and
concluded
that
a
hearing
is
the
essence
of
due
process.
but
that
appointment
of
counsel
may
not
be
required.
in
conclusion,
then
we
ask
this
court
to
grant
the
relief
for
appellants
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
i
would
suppose
that
in
many
if
not
most
aspects
of
civil
litigation.
it
would
be
useful
perhaps
necessary
to
have
an
attorney.
but
a
holding
in
this
case
would
not
compel
a
later
holding
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
civil
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
because
in
this
case,
we
are
relying
upon
the
specific
first
amendment
guarantee
of
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
there
is
no
such
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
take
it
that
the
first
amendment
and
speaking
about
the
right
to
petition
is
speaking
about
access
to
the
courts
or
to
government.
it
would
always
remain
true
that
the
fruits
of
that
access
inherently
will
be
unequal.
now
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
might
want
to
go
farther
and
to
hold
that
for
example,
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
certain
types
of
civil
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
think
a
holding
of
that
nature
as
to
courts
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
now,
when
i
say
that,
what
i
have
in
mind
are
the
kinds
of
considerations
this
court
had
in
mind
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
in
saying
that
due
process
must
be
afforded
at
some
point
by
the
state
whether
it
be
in
what
is
called
an
administrative
hearing
or
what
is
called
the
court.
but
the
functions
of
courts
must
be
performed
and
they
must
be
performed
equally
at
least
open
equally
to
the
rich
and
then
the
poor
alike.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
they
must
pay
the
costs
if
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
don't
think
that
argument
carries
that
far,
if
i
understand
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
correctly.
well,
the
argument
which
i'm
making
today,
i
don't
think
compels
anyone
to
go
that
far
anytime.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
do.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
there
are
several
reasons.
first,
i
would
argue
that
the
availability
of
other
sources
is
irrelevant
to
whether
or
not
these
appellants
have
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
into
a
court
of
connecticut
and
file
a
proceeding
without
having
to
pay
for
sanctions,
for
fees
which
that
state
court
has
imposed
upon
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
yes.
now
secondly,
with
respect
to
that,
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear
that
the
state
of
connecticut
will
not
provide
those
funds
on
request.
i
must
say
that,
i
personally
resent
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
as
an
attorney,
mr.
cannon
is
going
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
in
the
fashion
in
which
he
did
because
for
example,
there
is
no
program
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
will
provide
court
fees
to
indigent
litigants
upon
request.
there
is
only
one
program
in
which
the
state
of
connecticut
is
at
all
involved,
and
that
is
a
pilot
program
serving
a
small
section
of
middle
town
in
the
county
around
it.
for
the
rest
of
the
state
and
i
might
add
for
the
rest
of
the
nation,
people
going
to
legal
services
programs
cannot
get
into
court
unless
their
program
is
fortunate
about
to
have
excess
funds
or
a
budget
item
which
allows
for
payment
of
fees.
the
haven
legal
assistance
is
one
of
the
few
programs
in
the
country
to
my
knowledge
which
over
the
years
has
had
some
funds
available
for
payment
of
court
fees.
there
are
limited
funds,
they're
insufficient.
but
more
importantly,
if
a
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
walk
into
a
court,
he
should
not
have
to
go
begging
or
soliciting
or
his
attorney
should
not
have
to
go
soliciting
to
charitable
voluntary
ad
hoc
agencies
or
governmental
programs
for
something
which
the
state
of
connecticut
is
obligated
to
provide.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
and
so
that
i
maintain
that
mr.
cannon's
argument
or
at
least
the
burden
of
it
missed
the
point
of
this
appeal
which
is
that
these
appellants
don't
have
to
go
to
charitable
organizations
which
may
or
may
not
have
funds
to
get
something
which
the
state
is
obligated
to
provide.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
point
which
mr.
cannon
i
guess
was
arguing.
new
haven
legal
assistance
does
not
have
the
funds
for
these
appellants.
if
they
did,
i
would
never
have
started
this
case.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
did.
your
honor,
these
cases
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
state
of
connecticut
has
not
fund.
there
is
no
source
for
these
fees.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
fund
that
he
is
talking
about
to
the
extent,
i
understood
it;
related
to
a
small
fund
from
the
welfare
department,
for
a
pilot
project
in
middle
town
jointly
funded
with
hew.
it
has
no
bearing
on
these
appellants
or
on
the
rest
of
the
state.
the
allegations
and
the
affidavits
in
this
record
remain
unchallenged
and
they
remain
true
that
there
is
no
place
for
these
appellants
to
go.
now,
if
this
court
is
concerned
about
the
present
financial
status
of
these
appellants,
i
will
be
happy
to
submit
affidavits
to
this
court
to
persuade
it
that
this
case
is
still
alive
and
not
moot.
but
remanding
this
case
after
these
applications
sat
in
my
office
for
six
month
and
after
this
case
is
taken
two
and
a
half
years,
i
submit
would
be
cruel.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
first
of
course,
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
but
if
they
did
do
that
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
pardon?
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
there
is
such
a
regulation
or
such
a
program,
mr.
cannon
has
to
have
two
and
a
half
years
to
refer
it
in
his
brief.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
object
in
the
posture
of
this
case
which
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
for
two-and-a-half
years
and
the
state
has
never
once
documented
the
argument
which
it
has
made
more
or
less
for
the
first
time
today.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
the
fact
that
the
state
has
not
raised
any
reference
to
any
program
or
regulation
indicates
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
you
found
it,
then
i
would
suggest
that's
possibly
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
if
it
were
a
program
clearly
available
to
these
appellants.
then
perhaps
it
might
moot
this
appeal
and
perhaps
then
a
remand
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
mean
an
official
program
-
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
certainly
would
not
your
honor.
these
appellants
don't
have
to
go
to
charities
to
seek
what
is
a
constitutional
right.
now
--
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you.
i
will
provide
them
within
two
weeks
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
i
would
like
the
opportunity
to
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
those
your
honor.
i
feel
strongly
that
this
case
should
not
be
remanded.
mr.
arthur
b.
lafrance
thank
you
your
honor.
