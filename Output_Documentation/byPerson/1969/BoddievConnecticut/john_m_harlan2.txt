describe
the
state
interest
that's

of
its
court
circumstances
of
this
kind?
what
do
you
think
the
real
estate
interest
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
interest
this,
is
the
state
serving
consuming
for
the
moment
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
screening
process
to
prevent
abusive
resorts
of
to
the
courts.
what
others
in
the
statement
personal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
merely
is
the
legislature
because
the
better
body
to
do
it,
but
what
is
the
--
to
make
the
change
and
what
is
the
state
interest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
supposed
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
protected
it
self
by
setting
up

screening
process
of
some
kind
that
you
said

or
we
won't
waive
these
fees
frivolous,
untenable
litigation,
and
what
interest
is
there
in

requires
across
the
board
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.

let
me
follow
through
a
little
bit
on
your
equal
protection
argument.
suppose
instead
of
wanting
the
divorce,
your
clients
wanted
to
get
married
and
the
marriage
license
worth
$3.00.
would
you
say
that
equal
protection
demands
that
they
be
given
the
marriage
license
without
payment
of
the
fee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
you
drawn
no
distinction
between
the
need
for
a
divorce
and
the
desire
to
marry?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
record
show
in
any
way
that
re-marriage
was
contemplated
by
the
parties
or
any
of
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then,
let
me
ask
the
next
question
which
you
indicated.
would
you
carry
your
equal
protection
clause
to
a
--
the
fishing
license
or
dog
license?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
draw
the
distinction
where?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
draw
the
line
and
where?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
the
right
to
fish
in
a
lake
of
connecticut
as
a
civil
liberty
right,
if
there
are
any
lakes
in
connecticut
with
fish
left
in
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
state
has
failed
to
raise
a
defense
which
might
be
a
defense,
even
if
its
own
facts
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
decide
or
live
with
it,
could
be
sent
back
to
the
state
court
in
some
proceeding
so
that
they
could
look
up
and
see
whether
or
not
these
people
can
get
their
divorce
money
from
the
state
or
from
the
federal
government.
