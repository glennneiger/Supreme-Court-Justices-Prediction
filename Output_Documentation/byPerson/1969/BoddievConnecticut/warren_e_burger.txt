mr.

if

out
which

pay

would
that

would
not
have
to
go
through
that
screening
process?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
i'm
not
sure
i
have
the
position
on
it.
i'm
just
thinking
the
kind
of
arguments
that
we
likely
be
tendered
to
this
court
to
make
the
poor
man
go
through
a

which
rich
man
don't
have

chief

e.

mr.
lafrance,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
two
and
a
half
or
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
that
assumed
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
bring
frivolous
litigation
as
you
have
defined
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.

sounds
like
the
predicate
for
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
defined
it
in
your
hypothesis
as
frivolous.
you
say
because
a
rich
man
can
bring
frivolous
litigation,
a
poor
man
must
be
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
like
a
merit?
chief

i
think
your

is
up
mr.

thank
you
for
your

thank
you

mr.

yours.
the

chief

we'll
hear

in

27,
boddie

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
when
were
these
papers
originally
filed
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
march
68
to
now,
i
suppose
we
must
assume
they
have
not
been
able
to
accumulate
$60.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
of
a
showing
have
they
made
with
respect
to
their
indigency
if
you
wish
to
call
it
that.
and
second
has
any
showing
then
brought
up
to
date
from
march
of
1968
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
have
you
interrupted
counsel.
you
spoke
in
terms
of
a
right
that
comes
by
way
of
the
franchise.
would
you
say
that
a
man
who
seeks
of
license
to
practice
to
carry
on
the
business
of
being
a
barber
of
an
electrician
or
a
plumber,
one
of
the
license
activities
that
have
it
substantial
license
fee
or
some
due
up
to
a
$100.00
or
more?
it's
in
the
same
category
as
your
client
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
isn't
he
--
isn't
there
an
inherit
right,
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
an
occupation
if
you
can
pay
the
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
parens
patriae,
if
not
on
broader
grounds
have
a
deep
interest
in
regulating
the
termination
of
the
married
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
impose
on
everyone,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
hypothetical
really
isn't
worth
very
much
because
there
is
no
state
in
the
country
that
ever
had
any
such
a
statute
it
has.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
negatively,
the
negative
impact
is
what
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
are
these
--
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
and
decided
the
case
the
way
you
wanted
to
decide
it,
and
the
week
afterwards,
someone
comes
in
and
wants
to
get
a
divorce
and
they
say
now,
i
have
plenty
of
money.
but
if
you
don't
let
me
file
my
action
without
the
payment
of
the
fee,
you're
denying
me
equal
protection
as
compared
with
gladys
boddie
and
the
other
people
involved
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cannon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
connecticut
apply
furnished
on
application,
the
filing
fees
for
divorces,
for
people
who
are
unrelief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem
if
mr.
justice
black
was
inquiring
about,
that
it
doesn't
reach
the
question
of
filing
fees,
the
$45.00
or
$60.00,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
the
amount
of
the
fee
here
is
$45.00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
well
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legal
aid
doesn't
supply
that,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
do,
why
are
here.
we
all
of
it,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
specifically,
do
they
pay
the
$45.00
we
are
here
talking
about
if
they
ask
for
it?
are
you
-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
since
your
friend
and
you
are
both
here
on
a
constitutional
issue
as
your
friend
is
posed
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
no
small
importance.
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
petitioner
has
not
exhausted
her
administrative
remedies,
if
you
could
call
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
court
to
decide
is
a
constitutional
matter
that
the
fee
is
to
be
waived?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
refused,
you
mean
the
waiver
of
the
entry
fee
was
refused,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
didn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
counsel,
i'm
afraid
i
led
you
into
this
by
my
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
here
had
exhausted
appellants
i
should
say,
the
appellants
here
had
exhausted
all
of
their
available
remedies
whether
administrative
or
otherwise.
but
you
tell
us
now
that
situation
has
developed
considerably
since
the
action
was
originally
started.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
develops,
if
it
develops
that
through
the
welfare
program
of
the
state
of
connecticut
as
it
now
exists,
whether
the
money
comes
all
from
connecticut
or
partly
from
the
federal
government
and
partly
from
the
state,
and
if
it
that
program
would
advance
to
persons
in
posture
of
mrs.
boddie.
the
$45.00
to
file
to
make
the
entry
fee
payment
then,
would
there
be
any
constitutional
question
for
us
to
decide?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
would
make
any
difference
if
in
the
meantime,
she's
got
her
$45.00
entry
fee
paid
from
some
sort.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
she's
in
the
court
and
she
has
no
case
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cannon,
i
did
not
understand
you
to
be
changing
your
position
in
any
essence
of
not
in
terms
of
not
standing
on
the
posture
pleadings
when
the
case
came
here.
but
in
the
response
to
my
questions
and
others,
you
have
indicated
that
the
situation
may
have
change
since
this
litigation
started.
then
that
there
may
now
be
publicly
supported
agencies
within
the
state
of
connecticut
who
would
supply
the
$45.00
and
that
line
of
questioning
was
pursued
i
think
by
all
of
us
with
respect
to
the
basic
proposition
that
mr.
justice
black
suggested
to
you
that
if
there
is
any
other
solution.
we
do
not
reach
large
constitutional
issues.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
you
be
willing
to
represent
to
the
court
that
if
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
courts
of
connecticut
that
there
may
well
be
facilities
to
provide
her
with
money
that
were
not
available
when
this
action
was
started?
could
you
represent
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
cases?
criminal
or
civil
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
budget
cover
all
civil
matters,
the
one
you're
reading
from?
that
includes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
includes
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
your
time
is
up
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
time
is
up
too
counsel
that
i
would
have
to
questions
to
put
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
heard
this
colloquy
of
course
and
i'm
sure
as
a
member
of
this
bar,
you
know
that
this
court
doesn't
reach
constitutional
issues
if
there's
any
way
to
avoid
them.
do
you
see
any
reason
why
this
case
should
not
be
remanded
in
the
courts
of
connecticut
for
consideration
in
light
of
the
changed
conditions
which
may
have
occurred
and
which
are
suggested
to
have
occurred
by
way
of
providing
means
for
this
$45.00
entry
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
state
of
connecticut
through
its
agencies
will
provide
that
$45.00
on
request?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
asked
him
to
go
out
of
the
record
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
there
are
anymore
questions
counsel,
you're
time
is
up
but
we
--
you
may
respond
to
any
other
questions.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
think
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
mr.
cannon
may
submit
any
information
that
relates,
bears
on
the
issue.
but
some
members
of
the
court
aren't
concerned
about
namely
and
specifically
whether
any
public
authority
in
the
state
of
connecticut
either
or
whether
supported
by
the
state
of
connecticut
of
federal
or
both
or
indeed
separately
any
private
authority,
whether
that's
relevant
or
not,
we
don't
know.
but
you
may
submit
that
material
as
well
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course,
each
of
you
will
exchange
your
information
before
it
comes
up
here.
chief

e.

thank

e.

we'll
hear
argument
in
number
27,
boddie
against
connecticut.
mr.
lafrance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
were
these
papers
originally
filed
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
march
68
to
now,
i
suppose
we
must
assume
they
have
not
been
able
to
accumulate
$60.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
of
a
showing
have
they
made
with
respect
to
their
indigency
if
you
wish
to
call
it
that.
and
second
has
any
showing
then
brought
up
to
date
from
march
of
1968
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
have
you
interrupted
counsel.
you
spoke
in
terms
of
a
right
that
comes
by
way
of
the
franchise.
would
you
say
that
a
man
who
seeks
of
license
to
practice
to
carry
on
the
business
of
being
a
barber
of
an
electrician
or
a
plumber,
one
of
the
license
activities
that
have
it
substantial
license
fee
or
some
due
up
to
a
$100.00
or
more?
it's
in
the
same
category
as
your
client
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
isn't
he
--
isn't
there
an
inherit
right,
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
an
occupation
if
you
can
pay
the
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
not
the
state
in
its
capacity
as
parens
patriae,
if
not
on
broader
grounds
have
a
deep
interest
in
regulating
the
termination
of
the
married
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
impose
on
everyone,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
hypothetical
really
isn't
worth
very
much
because
there
is
no
state
in
the
country
that
ever
had
any
such
a
statute
it
has.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
negatively,
the
negative
impact
is
what
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
are
these
--
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
and
decided
the
case
the
way
you
wanted
to
decide
it,
and
the
week
afterwards,
someone
comes
in
and
wants
to
get
a
divorce
and
they
say
now,
i
have
plenty
of
money.
but
if
you
don't
let
me
file
my
action
without
the
payment
of
the
fee,
you're
denying
me
equal
protection
as
compared
with
gladys
boddie
and
the
other
people
involved
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cannon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
connecticut
apply
furnished
on
application,
the
filing
fees
for
divorces,
for
people
who
are
unrelief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem
if
mr.
justice
black
was
inquiring
about,
that
it
doesn't
reach
the
question
of
filing
fees,
the
$45.00
or
$60.00,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
the
amount
of
the
fee
here
is
$45.00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
well
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legal
aid
doesn't
supply
that,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
do,
why
are
here.
we
all
of
it,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
specifically,
do
they
pay
the
$45.00
we
are
here
talking
about
if
they
ask
for
it?
are
you
-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
since
your
friend
and
you
are
both
here
on
a
constitutional
issue
as
your
friend
is
posed
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
no
small
importance.
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
petitioner
has
not
exhausted
her
administrative
remedies,
if
you
could
call
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
court
to
decide
is
a
constitutional
matter
that
the
fee
is
to
be
waived?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
refused,
you
mean
the
waiver
of
the
entry
fee
was
refused,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
didn't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
counsel,
i'm
afraid
i
led
you
into
this
by
my
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
here
had
exhausted
appellants
i
should
say,
the
appellants
here
had
exhausted
all
of
their
available
remedies
whether
administrative
or
otherwise.
but
you
tell
us
now
that
situation
has
developed
considerably
since
the
action
was
originally
started.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
develops,
if
it
develops
that
through
the
welfare
program
of
the
state
of
connecticut
as
it
now
exists,
whether
the
money
comes
all
from
connecticut
or
partly
from
the
federal
government
and
partly
from
the
state,
and
if
it
that
program
would
advance
to
persons
in
posture
of
mrs.
boddie.
the
$45.00
to
file
to
make
the
entry
fee
payment
then,
would
there
be
any
constitutional
question
for
us
to
decide?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
would
make
any
difference
if
in
the
meantime,
she's
got
her
$45.00
entry
fee
paid
from
some
sort.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
she's
in
the
court
and
she
has
no
case
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cannon,
i
did
not
understand
you
to
be
changing
your
position
in
any
essence
of
not
in
terms
of
not
standing
on
the
posture
pleadings
when
the
case
came
here.
but
in
the
response
to
my
questions
and
others,
you
have
indicated
that
the
situation
may
have
change
since
this
litigation
started.
then
that
there
may
now
be
publicly
supported
agencies
within
the
state
of
connecticut
who
would
supply
the
$45.00
and
that
line
of
questioning
was
pursued
i
think
by
all
of
us
with
respect
to
the
basic
proposition
that
mr.
justice
black
suggested
to
you
that
if
there
is
any
other
solution.
we
do
not
reach
large
constitutional
issues.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
you
be
willing
to
represent
to
the
court
that
if
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
courts
of
connecticut
that
there
may
well
be
facilities
to
provide
her
with
money
that
were
not
available
when
this
action
was
started?
could
you
represent
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
cases?
criminal
or
civil
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
budget
cover
all
civil
matters,
the
one
you're
reading
from?
that
includes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
includes
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
i
think
your
time
is
up
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
time
is
up
too
counsel
that
i
would
have
to
questions
to
put
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
heard
this
colloquy
of
course
and
i'm
sure
as
a
member
of
this
bar,
you
know
that
this
court
doesn't
reach
constitutional
issues
if
there's
any
way
to
avoid
them.
do
you
see
any
reason
why
this
case
should
not
be
remanded
in
the
courts
of
connecticut
for
consideration
in
light
of
the
changed
conditions
which
may
have
occurred
and
which
are
suggested
to
have
occurred
by
way
of
providing
means
for
this
$45.00
entry
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
state
of
connecticut
through
its
agencies
will
provide
that
$45.00
on
request?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
asked
him
to
go
out
of
the
record
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
there
are
anymore
questions
counsel,
you're
time
is
up
but
we
--
you
may
respond
to
any
other
questions.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
think
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
mr.
cannon
may
submit
any
information
that
relates,
bears
on
the
issue.
but
some
members
of
the
court
aren't
concerned
about
namely
and
specifically
whether
any
public
authority
in
the
state
of
connecticut
either
or
whether
supported
by
the
state
of
connecticut
of
federal
or
both
or
indeed
separately
any
private
authority,
whether
that's
relevant
or
not,
we
don't
know.
but
you
may
submit
that
material
as
well
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course,
each
of
you
will
exchange
your
information
before
it
comes
up
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
lafrance.
thank
you
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted
subject
to
those
filings.
