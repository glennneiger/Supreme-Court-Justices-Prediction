mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
that's
under
attack
in
this
case,
that
portion
of
it,
52-259
excuse
me,
they
shall
be
paid
to
the
clerks
of
the
supreme
court
or
the
superior
court
for
which
civil
cost
$45.00.
that
is
the
entry
fee.
now
the
problem
in
this
case
is
not
particularly
the
court
cost.
it's
the
marrying
which
cases
started
at
least
in
connecticut
that
client
or
person
goes
usually
to
a
lawyer
if
he
has
or
a
person
has
a
case,
the
writ
is
drawn,
the
lawyer
gives
it
to
the
sheriff
or
brought
a
proper
officer
for
service.
and
the
service
officer
makes
a
fee,
makes
a
service
and
returns
the
writ
to
court.
now,
the
fee
payable
to
the
sheriff
is
paid
by
the
client
or
the
lawyer.
the
state
does
not
enter
into
that
angle
of
the
case
at
all.
the
case
is
returned
to
court
after
service.
now
if
they
are
not
arrest
in
defendants,
the
sheriff
has
to
go
over
the
court
or
with
the
representations
affidavit
made
the
lawyer
showing
the
type
of
service
which
would
most
likely
reach
the
attention
of
the
defendant.
very
often,
that
calls
for
publication
and
sometimes
a
series
of
publications,
two
or
more.
so,
it
was
on
their
basis
of
these
features
and
many
other
features
that
we
argued
in
the
lower
court
that
this
is
matter
of
legislative
action
rather
than
judicial
determination.
every
state
in
the
union
so
far
as
i
know
including
the
support
of
the
federal
courts
have
entry
fees
and
court
fees.
they're
waived
in
the
federal
court
by
a
form
of
pauper
statute.
that
is
true
to
in
some
other
states.
they
have
form
of
pauper
statutes.
but
there
are
so
many
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
for
form
of
pauper
statute
that
it
would
seem
to
me
a
pauper
domain
for
the
legislature.
and
then
that
regard,
we
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
in
connecticut
right
now
as
of
july
1,
they've
started
through
the
welfare
department
of
pilot
program.
including
in
it
is
a
legal
services
and
appropriations
for
it
and
last
week
before
coming
down,
we
checked
in
the
progress
of
this
pilot
program
which
is
funded
by
the
welfare
department.
it's
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
there'
a
schedule
attached
there
to
showing
the
appropriations
available.
now
that
case
among
other
actions
they've
had
through
the
legal
assistance
program
in
middlesex
in
county,
it's
involved
and
i
think
three
counties,
smaller
counties
to
give
it
a
test
program,
to
promote
and
advocate
legislation
in
the
next
turn
around.
they
have
six
divorces'
cases
printing
since
july
1.
they
are
making
or
negotiating
a
contract
with
the
middlesex
bar
association
to
conduct
this
because
it
was
not
only
divorce
case
and
it's
not
only
welfare
cases
that
probably
need
access
to
courts,
but
there
are
many,
many
indigence
probably
who
can't
afford
litigations.
some
of
there
rights
are
waived.
the
oeo
or
legal
assistance
in
new
haven
has
paid
for
entry
fees.
they
do
have
appropriations
entry
fees.
they
could
have
well
brought
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
in
one
situation
bringing
the
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
connecticut
court
give
the
connecticut
courts
of
proper
way
to
pass
on
this
issue
in
a
judicial
fashion.
the
federal
court
has
held
this
and
another
cases
that
the
clerk
and
the
judge
who
says
you
can't
get
in
to
court
unless
you
pay
the
entry
fee,
i
have
no
power
to
waive
the
statute,
but
i
can't
--
the
judicial
capacity,
we're
acting
these
administrators
and
the
federal
court
says
that
exactly
that
that
they're
acting
in
administrative
capacity
when
they
say
they
have
no
power
to
waive
the
court.
whether
the
connecticut
courts
would
have
done
anything
on
that,
i
do
not
know.
no
one
else,
they
do
and
i
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
it
as
a
group
decided
the
supreme
court.
the
only
issues
here
are
the
--
if
there
is
any
constitutional
problem
in
this
case,
it's
whether
or
not
the
entry
fees
statute
provides
equal
protection.
it
seems
necessary
to
have
these
entry
fee
statutes,
court
cost,
if
they're
reasonable
in
nature
and
do
not
impose
an
undo
burden
and
no
unfair
discrimination,
no
invidious
discrimination.
they
are
arbitrary
or
harsh,
then,
the
fall
has
been
allowed.
i
do
not
know
if
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
there
was
no
other
similar
situation
and
this
court
has
not
expanded
the
griffin
doctrine
to
situations
such
as
this.
the
civil
suit
which
doesn't
have
in
and
over
itself
for
a
no
state
participation
whatsoever,
it's
a
dispute
between
two
individuals
and
this
case
here,
if
the
judgment
was
rendered
on
this
case,
this
is
for
welfare
recipients.
hundreds
of
other
people
in
connecticut
that
are
indigent
can't
afford
it,
but
there
not
welfare
recipients.
the
judgment
of
this
case
could
well
revert
and
reverse
discrimination.
that's
why
we
say
it's
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
at
due
process,
the
parties,
the
plaintiffs
made
the
same
claim
in
the
federal
court
about
the
due
process,
but
due
process
--
this
three-judge
court
didn't
even
consider
the
issue
of
due
process.
i
think
due
process
is
pertinent
cases
of
this
type.
they
have
the
right
to
go
to
get
into
court.
the
only
thing
is
the
condition
of
getting
in
is
him
by
a
reasonably
entry
fee
as
these
entry
fees
prevails
throughout
the
united
states
or
court
cost
prevailed
throughout
the
united
states.
and
appeals
even
the
federal
statute
of
1915,
incidentally
provides
only
that
in
a
civil
case
brought
in
form
paupers,
the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
any
such
person
unable
to
employ
counsel.
there's
plenty
of
cases
on
that
and
they
have
been
interpreted
to
mean
only
that
the
court
may
request.
they
cannot
order
representation
by
counsel
such
as
they
do
in
all
civil
cases.
we
of
course
in
connecticut
have
numerous
situations
which
by
statute
or
specific
circumstances
allow
people
to
get
in
the
court
without
payment
of
fees.
where
workman's
compensation,
the
uniform
support,
that's
been
waive,
but
on
the
statute
has
been
waive
as
a
matter
of
policy
with
most
dates
and
there's
others
that
for
the
moment,
i
just
skip
my
mind.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
in
the
uniform
reciprocals
enforcement
support
act
and
yes
your
honor
and
they
waived
them
as
the
matter
of
policy
in
all
cases
that
uniform
reciprocals
support
act
provides
that
state
may
waive
the
cost.
that
is
where
they
collect
for
a
wife
in
connecticut,
a
husband
some
other
state
or
vice
versa.
a
wife
can
enforce
support
for
herself
and
the
children
by
having
proceedings
in
one
state
orders
in
the
other
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
a
notation
there
as
i
recall
it
$60.00.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but
there's
no
$60.00
fee
in
any
court
cost
in
connecticut.
it
would
be
combination
of
the
--
if
it's
$60.00,
the
combination
of
$45.00
or
entry
fee
and
the
$15.00
fee
which
the
client
owes
to
share
but
not
the
court
do
not
involved
in
this
situation
at
all.
before
it
closing,
either
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
service
or
process
against
the
defendant
citing
them
in.
served
the
living
with
him
or
as
the
usual
place
for
both,
must
be
the
resident
of
the
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
in
divorce,
it
probably
not
other,
but
there
is
witness
fees,
investigation
ordinary
cases,
investigation
fees
and
the
counts
of
course.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
not
in
divorce,
i
mean
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
in
divorce
fees
--
divorce
cases,
i
would
say
there's
probably
rate
cost,
the
sheriff,
the
witnesses
and
publication.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i've
never
heard
of
that
situation
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
the
service
has
to
do.
there
some
and
then
under
the
connecticut
statute
by
a
written
summons
to
appear
in
court.
now,
for
word
of
proper
form
and
were
signed
by
an
attorney
or
ordered
sign
by
a
clerk
or
judge
rather,
then
they
could
accept
service.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
without
actually
making
the
summons
or
making
actual
service
of
the
summons,
yes.
but
there's
another
statute
would
says
in
every
civil
action
shall
be
in
a
special
form.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
with
the
writ
of
summons
and
complaint.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
there's
a
90-day
waiting
period
in
connecticut.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
after
waiting
90
days
at
any
event
after
they
return
day
before
it
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
to
take
evidence
and
it's
usually
two
or
three
witnesses
requires.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
usually
two
or
three
supporting
witnesses
required.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
i
think
this
your
honor,
i
think
the
fees
are
reasonable
and
then
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
it
seems
to
me
is
by
discretionary
whereby
legislature.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
state
interest
is
only
--
i
presumed
to
prevent
frivolous
litigation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
tend
to
prevent
it
rather.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
think
that
state
has
legitimate
interest
to
waive
all
court
fees,
a
license
within
the
realm
of
the
legislature
to
do
it,
they
could
have
do
it
of
course,
but
they
have
to
provide
tax
measure
elsewhere,
thus
the
entry
fee
do,
can
or
do
help
to
support
the
judiciary
system.
as
far
as
disputes
between
the
parties
are
concerned
in
a
divorce
case,
the
state
is
a
more
on
standing
under
the
sidelines.
they
are
not
a
party
to
the
action.
they
don't
represent,
the
only
place
that
possible
in
their
state
would
get
interested
in
a
divorce
case
as
if
they
were
minor
children
on
welfare
or
in
hospital
or
mentally
retarded
institution
or
somewhat
in
that
sort,
so
welfare
standpoint.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
i
don't
know
how
they
could
or
have
a
screening
process
work
in
any
event.
if
i
intimated
that,
i
didn't
mean
it,
i
wouldn't
think
even
from
part
from
the
constitutional
questions
which
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
would
also
seem
to
be
very
commerce
and
then
workable.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
think
there
are
to
be
a
reasonably
form
of
pauper
statute
in
every
state
that
myself,
but
i
don't
know
how
it's
going
of
the
done.
there
are
so
many
factors.
there
are
so
many
situations
that
will
come
up.
i'm
sure
that
this
program,
it's
now
being
well
developed
some
good.
the
funds
appropriated.
there's
a
total
$119,000.00.
i
think
that
was
more
than
that
though
i
believe.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
pilot
--
there's
a
pilot
program
justice.
it
is
being
worked
out
through
the
welfare
department
in
hartford,
in
connecticut.
it's
a
special
legal
services
project;
a
$119,000.00
is
being
tried
out
in
two
smaller
counties
up
there
and
the
director
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
dollars.
and
they
provide
legal
services
and
their
purpose
is
as
said
by
the
acting
commission
in
welfare
is
to
enable
us
to
make
recommendations
for
program
or
policy
changes
that
our
statewide
programs
we
are
getting
this
form
of
pauper
statutes.
somebody's
got
to
pay
the
sheriff
for
publication
and
newspaper
and
things
like
that.
now,
what
--
there's
another
problem
is
to
what
appropriated
state
fund
is
going
to
be
charge
to.
we
have
statute
of
course
that
no
state
officer
can
spend
the
moneys
that
are
not
appropriated
and
other
statute
that
he
can
only
spend
the
moneys
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
appropriated.
otherwise,
this
personal
liability
on
the
officer
had
probably
other
expose
to
other
chargers.
it's
sort
of
a
complex
procedure
and
seemed
to
me
that
it's
a
matter
really
for
the
--
rather
really
for
the
legislature
and
i
think
that
the
constitutional
programs
for
questions
raised
either
are
not
too
momentous
in
view
of
the
fact
that
access
is
a
due
process
isn't
a
picture
because
access
the
court
is
not
deny,
it's
him
then
or
condition
by
a
reasonable
charge
which
is
prevails,
so
far
as
i
know
that
every
state
in
the
union
and
then
the
federal
government,
the
federal
courts.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
old
cases
have
said
so
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
old
cases
which
seemed
to
indicated
that
where
is
not
likely
they've
been
large
and
made
it
into
more
rarely
available
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
would
bar
divorce?
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
it's
purely
state
matter.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
would
think
justice
it's
purely
state
matter
the
court
may
bard
divorces
without
being
in
contravention
of
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
would
not
think
so
that
bringing
every
state
in
the
union
has
different
grounds
and
different
conditions
prevailing
in
divorce
cases.
as
far
as
connecticut
is
concerned
of
the
end
of
three
year
residence,
but
now
this
year,
they
reduced
it
to
one
year
to
show
that
their
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
understand
what's
really
at
stake
in
this
case
perhaps
it's
rather
outlined
briefly
the
procedures
followed
in
divorce
actions
are
civil
actions
in
connecticut,
all
civil
actions.
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
client
sees
the
attorney.
the
attorney
discernments
whether
it
has
a
cause
of
action
and
draws
a
writ
which
is
delivered
to
the
officer
to
make
service
at
the
expense
of
the
client
or
and
then
the
officer
returns
the
writ
to
court.
at
that
time,
the
statute
comes
into
play,
and
says
the
clerk
for
the
court
shall
charge
$45.00
for
entering
all
civil
causes.
that's
the
statute.
to
accomplish
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
it
is
necessary
that
some
provision
also
be
made
to
pay
these
auxiliary
costs
which
are
incident
to
the
divorce
cases.
very
often
there's
expensive
advertisement
or
publication
particularly
when
the
defendant
is
absent
from
the
state.
now
in
this
complaint,
another
thought
we
must
bear
in
mind,
it
seems
to
me.
in
this
complaint,
the
only
plaintiffs
are
women
on
welfares.
they
are
not
poor
people
generally.
there's
thousands
of
poor
people
as
everyone
knows
who
are
working
their
head's
off
to
try
to
make
a
living
in
case
that
they're
only
together
and
resent
or
check
on
the
welfare.
and
that
class
of
people
who's
entitled
of
relief
as
this
well
as
these
people,
if
they
are
entitled
to
relief.
at
presently,
the
court
raised
the
thought,
what
has
been
done
since
the
last
time
we
were
here?
presently,
we
find
all
inability,
welfare
women
or
other
poor
people
to
get
divorce
cases,
divorce
actions.
there
are
as
plenty
of
them
handled
by
the
legal
assistance
association.
a
great
number
of
them
are
being
handled.
we
try
to
get
some
figures
from
them
through
the
clerk
of
the
court
but
they
weren't
supplied.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
have
any
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
we
have
other
situations
where
no
court
fees
are
charge,
but
there
not
in
forma
pauperis
statutes.
they
apply
to
everyone
regardless
of
his
status.
there
is
this
legal
services
program
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
before
which
has
been
initiated
and
by
hew
and
the
local
welfare
department
is
an
experiment
being
carried
on
in
five
states
in
the
union.
connecticut
happens
to
be
one
of
them.
it's
a
legal
service
organization
in
the
towns
of
meriden
and
southington
and
wallingford
and
that's
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
if
the
sheriff's
fee
–
there's
no
direct
state
action
in
the
sheriff's
fee.
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
$45.00
is
what
goes
to
state
of
connecticut
as
an
entry
fee.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
and
the
statute
provides
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
they
do
and
so
is
legal
assistance.
connecticut
contributes
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
know.
at
the
beginning,
maybe
the
legal
assistance
didn't'
pay
all
the
fees.
they
don't
pay
them
now.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
understand
so,
but
depending
upon
the
judgment
of
the
director
of
the
legal
aid
assistance.
he
in
his
discretion
according
to
their
setup
can
determine
which
cases
have
the
most
significance,
and
accordingly,
they
allot
their
money
that
they
collect
from
the
federal
government
to
state
of
connecticut,
another
charitable
organizations
to
pay
the
cases
which
in
their
opinion
have
priority.
there's
the
other
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
-
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
difficulty
in
that
regard,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
please
is
that
these
are
not
state
agencies,
strictly
speaking.
a
legal
aid
assistance
association
incorporated
under
the
state
of
connecticut
pursuant
to
federal
legislation
which
recognized
and
advocated
that
these
legal
assistance
association
to
be
formed
in
conjunction
with
--
and
supported
by
the
local
bars
associations
to
provide
legal
services
for
the
poor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
pardon
me?
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
oh,
yes
your
honor.
there's
money
supplied.
i
have
the
1968
article,
certified
article
with
me.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
it's
our
opinion
that
they're
not
effectively
barred
and
they
are
a
lot
of
women
in
the
divorce
courts.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
give
you
court
assignment
here
on
september
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
there's
the
legal
aid
and
the
legal
services
programs;
two
different
programs,
each
paying
entry
fees,
each
pay
for
shares.
the
legal
aid
and
the
legal
aid
services
is
a
separate
program
just
to
initiate
the
writ
gotten
on
the
floor
since
we
argued
it
last
time.
the
first
three
or
four
months
when
that
was
organized
in
the
meriden
and
they
operate
entirely
different
way,
than
the
legal
aid
assistance
association.
they
are
not
a
corporation,
but
they
got
a
contracts
with
the
local
bar
associations.
and
they
have
a
director,
a
case
comes
in
and
it's
assigned
to
some
attorney
who
has
previously
indicated
that
he
will
accept
these
cases,
and
the
legal
aid
services
program
pays
this
attorney
a
modest
of
$16.00
an
hour
plus
the
cost
of
expenses.
and
in
meriden
and
wallingford
and
southington,
there
was
only
one
lawyer
out
of
the
whole
three
towns
which
comprised
of
our
population
of
75,000
to
100,000.
i
understand
there's
only
one
lawyer
who
didn't
signify
that
he
would
accept
to
work
along
with
this
program
because
of
age
or
infirmity
or
ill
health
for
some
reason.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
a
public
organization,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
is
state
supported
though
the
welfare
department.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
and
federal.
both
of
these
programs
are
federally
financed.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
to
say
with
this
proviso
your
honor
please.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
country
(ph)
fees
that
are
paid
by
the
legal
assistance
association.
mr.
lafrance's
client
or
he
formerly
was
with
the
legal
aid.
he
hasn't
been
with
them
for
over
a
year
or
more.
it
was
mr.
danford,
the
director,
who
determined
what
fees
should
be
paid
in
what
cases.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
no,
no,
i
don't.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i'm
not
saying
they
got
it.
i
don't
know
why
it
was
refused
to
him.
i
don't
know
why
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
oh,
no.
i
wouldn't
make
that
claim.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
was
refused
not
by
the
legal
aid;
it
was
refused
by
the
court,
the
state
of
connecticut
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
have
been
made
more
or
less
familiar
with
them
indirectly
on
the
legal
services
program.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
the
program
is
not
given
directly
to
the
welfare
recipient.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
is
given
to
the
welfare
department.
if
a
welfare
client
wants
legal
services
regardless
of
the
nature,
divorce
or
anything
else.
then,
they
have
two
attorneys
who
are
on
their
own
panel.
they
made
their
own
salary.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
are
free
for
the
indigent.
but
then,
there
are
additional
services
that
if
they
want
other
services
or
the
two
people
assigned
to
the
particular
job
or
rendering
legal
services
to
this
organization.
then,
the
lawyers
who
have
subscribed
as
being
willing
to
take
this
cases,
the
director
forwards
the
case
to
one
of
these
lawyers.
so
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes
and
pays
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
right.
they
get
a
lawyers
and
they
get
their
fees
paid
and
they
get
all
kinds
of
problems
and
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
is
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
we
will
admit
that.
we
don't
argue
that
fact.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
thought
the
court
--
that
the
situation
is
changed
materially
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
justice
black,
i
have
spoken
in
the
first
instance
about
the
legal
aid
or
service
which
is
an
experimental
problem.
it's
in
the
second
year.
it's
a
pilot
program.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
designed
to
determine
whether
the
federal
government
will
go
deeper
into
this,
provided
different
kinds
of
service
in
the
legal
aids
or
adopt
some
other
made.
that's
what
i
understand
the
legal
aid
service
is.
and
there
is
only
one
community
or
three
communities
being
handled
by
the
legal
aid.
it's
a
new
program
of
the
federal
--
of
hew.
but
prior
to
that
time,
this
legal
aid
assistance
corporation
was
organized
back
in
'64,
i
believe,
and
they
are
in
turn
financed
by
the
federal
government,
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
ford
foundation,
the
maya
foundation,
and
other
charitable
contributions.
so,
here
public
monies
are
charitable
monies,
and
they
have
given
them
to
him
for
certain
purpose.
and
they
ended
the
year
in
1968
with
a
substantial
sum
and
if
these
people
made
application
for
divorce
during
that
period.
this
legal
aid
assistance
had
the
money
to
pay
for
these
and
shares
and
entry
fees
during
that
period.
and
it
must
be
a
fact
that
others
get
in
to
court.
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
at
my
request
didn't
have
the
figures,
but
he
requested
to
aid
from
assistance
from
the
legal
aid
assistance
to
give
him
the
figures,
but
we
didn't
get
them.
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
may
very
well
be
that,
that
would
be
the
problem
or
action
to
pursue,
but
we
attacked
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
maybe
i've
confused
the
court.
the
state
has
no
appropriation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but,
it
gives
executive
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
makes
a
contribution
to
these
two
organizations.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
my
understanding
of
it
from
the
best
authority
i
know
and
that
in
the
audit
of
this
plaintiff
in
1968.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
not
from
--
there
would
be
no
live
constitutional
program.
you
think
that
we
can
get
that
information
by
affidavit,
but
we
get
cooperation
if
the
number
of
people
and
so
forth
from
this
legal
aid
assistance.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
if
you
may,
it
may
please
your
honor,
mr.
lafrance
has
been
absent
for
all
due
respect
to
mr.
lafrance
from
the
state
for
sometime,
but
i
made
the
inquiry
myself
as
to
how
many
of
these
plaintiffs,
since
the
action
was
instituted
have
filed
divorce
cases.
there
are
two.
one
was
withdrawn
i
think.
mary
anne
dochures
filed
for
divorce
in
march
1970.
her
lawyer
is
jonathan
e.
silver.
jonathan
e.
silver
is
under
staff
of
the
haven
legal
assistance.
i'm
i
correct?
and
mrs.
perez
filed
her
return
before
we
were
here
or
her
divorce
application
before
we
came
to
court
the
last
time
and
is
still
on
file.
but
she's
represented
by
atty.
gallagher
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
employed
by
the
new
haven
legal
assistance.
the
legal
aid
services
of
southington
or
he
is
an
independent
attorney.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
she's
in
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
the
only
two
i
know
of.
and
i
was
informed
that
they
some
--
if
they
are
possibly
capable
of
raising
the
money
paid
to
the
legal
aid
by
installments.
otherwise,
they
use
their
own
funds
that
they
get
from
other
sources.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
didn't
mean
to
deny
the
allegations
and
complaint.
i
misunderstood
apparently
the
questions
raised
as
to
what
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
at
this
plaintiffs
are
at
denial
in
year-and-a
half
since
this
case
has
been
standing.
it
is
our
claim
of
course,
constitutionally
or
on
the
merits
that
although
23
states,
for
example,
have
in
forma
pauperis
statutes.
two
of
them
do
not
apply
to
divorce
actions.
one
state
allows
divorce
actions
for
women
only
and
i
don't'
remember
now
what
the
other
state
could
apply.
but
in
all
of
these
cases
and
including
the
federal
proper
statute
281915,
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
as
to
whether
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
pursue
in
civil
action,
a
case
without
payment
of
court
fees.
the
court
in
this
recent
case
in
washington
dc,
harris
--
there
were
two
statutes.
one
is
general
statute
allowing
residents
of
washington
dc
to
secure
divorce
action
as
general
sessions
court
i
believe
it
was.
and
then
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
281915.
in
that
case,
the
court
didn't
get
into
the
constitutional
acts
features
but
it
reconciled
the
two
statutes
and
said
that
it
is
much
as
281915
did
not
exclude
the
divorce
cases.
then
the
plaintiffs
could
proceed
under
in
forma
pauperis
regulations.
now,
divorce
as,
it
is
far
furhter
claim
trial
further
claim
that
divorce
is
not
a
matter
of
fundamental
right.
it's
not
within
the
framework
and
can
man
of
the
constitution.
we
get
notations
like
goldberg
and
sniadach
and
other
cases
involved
in
due
process,
although,
there
are
civil
factors
involved.
they
are
to
my
opinion
nevertheless
rights,
the
one
wages.
wages
is
a
--
person
who
is
more
dependent
about
his
wages
every
week.
as
a
general
rule
then
if
a
person
who
has
money
in
the
bank.
there's
a
distinct
difference
there
and
to
deprive
and
attach
wages
is
as
the
court
said
a
brutal
blow,
but
wages
incidentally
haven't
been
attach
in
connecticut
for
years
and
years.
and
we
got
into
the
other
cases
on
equal
protection
and
so
forth.
equal
protection
of
life,
liberty
and
property.
the
equal
protection
has
to
--
the
item
under
consideration
has
to
attach
to
one
of
those
factors.
the
item
for
liberty
or
property.
in
goldberg
case
of
course,
it
was
liberty
that
was
due
process.
but
we
have
submitted
our
argument
in
the
first
brief.
we
have
now
relying
on
furthermore
on
the
dandridge
versus
williams's
case
which
is
the
reduction
of
the
maximum
welfare
benefits
due
to
families
of
over
five
or
six
was
decided
on
equal
protection,
and
i
think
that
case
fits
very
well
into
this
case.
assuming
it
is,
it's
--
there's
a
rationality
behind
the
procedure
adopted
by
the
state.
that
is
that
it's
reasonable
to
expect
that
persons
use
in
the
courts
will
pay
some
of
the
expense
of
maintaining.
that
is
done
in
every
state
in
the
federal
state
court
and
then
the
federal
courts
as
well
in
this
country
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
factual
situation,
i'll
have
to
admit
this
that
the
factual
situation
which
you
used
today
had
existed
when
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
we
haven't
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
probably
we
had
a
lot
of
cases
from
this
haven
legal
assistance
association.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
couldn't
answer
that.
i'll
have
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
she
personally,
i
will
concede
that
she
is
probably
unable
to
put
up
the
$45.00.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
because
it's
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
is
correct.
because
the
welfare
department
does
not
give
welfare
recipient
direct
money
for
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
my
understanding
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
can
prove
it
now,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
not
applied
to
the
individuals,
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
can
just
show
an
expenditures
sums
for
fees
and
cost.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
i
think
i
would.
i
got
an
honest
certified
attorney
of
the
new
haven
legal
assistance
can
show
us
an
expenditure
of
several
thousand
dollars
or
$6,000.00
plus
for
fees
and
costs
in
litigation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
in
all
kinds
of
cases
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
it's
not
broken
down
not
if
i
knew.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
excuse
me,
your
honor.
it's
all
cases,
but
it's
not
broken
down
in
this
audit
is
not
broken
down
by
--
i
got
flat
transcripts
and
costs,
total
$6,000.00
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
$6,000.00
plus.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
transcripts
and
costs.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
there's
no
criminal
fees;
we
have
public
defender
system
in
connecticut
on
public
and
criminal.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
not
necessarily
restricted
to
civil
cases.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
includes
and
it
indicates
a
surplus
on
hand
at
the
end
of
the
season.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
that's
under
attack
in
this
case,
that
portion
of
it,
52-259
excuse
me,
they
shall
be
paid
to
the
clerks
of
the
supreme
court
or
the
superior
court
for
which
civil
cost
$45.00.
that
is
the
entry
fee.
now
the
problem
in
this
case
is
not
particularly
the
court
cost.
it's
the
marrying
which
cases
started
at
least
in
connecticut
that
client
or
person
goes
usually
to
a
lawyer
if
he
has
or
a
person
has
a
case,
the
writ
is
drawn,
the
lawyer
gives
it
to
the
sheriff
or
brought
a
proper
officer
for
service.
and
the
service
officer
makes
a
fee,
makes
a
service
and
returns
the
writ
to
court.
now,
the
fee
payable
to
the
sheriff
is
paid
by
the
client
or
the
lawyer.
the
state
does
not
enter
into
that
angle
of
the
case
at
all.
the
case
is
returned
to
court
after
service.
now
if
they
are
not
arrest
in
defendants,
the
sheriff
has
to
go
over
the
court
or
with
the
representations
affidavit
made
the
lawyer
showing
the
type
of
service
which
would
most
likely
reach
the
attention
of
the
defendant.
very
often,
that
calls
for
publication
and
sometimes
a
series
of
publications,
two
or
more.
so,
it
was
on
their
basis
of
these
features
and
many
other
features
that
we
argued
in
the
lower
court
that
this
is
matter
of
legislative
action
rather
than
judicial
determination.
every
state
in
the
union
so
far
as
i
know
including
the
support
of
the
federal
courts
have
entry
fees
and
court
fees.
they're
waived
in
the
federal
court
by
a
form
of
pauper
statute.
that
is
true
to
in
some
other
states.
they
have
form
of
pauper
statutes.
but
there
are
so
many
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration
for
form
of
pauper
statute
that
it
would
seem
to
me
a
pauper
domain
for
the
legislature.
and
then
that
regard,
we
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
in
connecticut
right
now
as
of
july
1,
they've
started
through
the
welfare
department
of
pilot
program.
including
in
it
is
a
legal
services
and
appropriations
for
it
and
last
week
before
coming
down,
we
checked
in
the
progress
of
this
pilot
program
which
is
funded
by
the
welfare
department.
it's
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
there'
a
schedule
attached
there
to
showing
the
appropriations
available.
now
that
case
among
other
actions
they've
had
through
the
legal
assistance
program
in
middlesex
in
county,
it's
involved
and
i
think
three
counties,
smaller
counties
to
give
it
a
test
program,
to
promote
and
advocate
legislation
in
the
next
turn
around.
they
have
six
divorces'
cases
printing
since
july
1.
they
are
making
or
negotiating
a
contract
with
the
middlesex
bar
association
to
conduct
this
because
it
was
not
only
divorce
case
and
it's
not
only
welfare
cases
that
probably
need
access
to
courts,
but
there
are
many,
many
indigence
probably
who
can't
afford
litigations.
some
of
there
rights
are
waived.
the
oeo
or
legal
assistance
in
new
haven
has
paid
for
entry
fees.
they
do
have
appropriations
entry
fees.
they
could
have
well
brought
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
in
one
situation
bringing
the
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
connecticut
court
give
the
connecticut
courts
of
proper
way
to
pass
on
this
issue
in
a
judicial
fashion.
the
federal
court
has
held
this
and
another
cases
that
the
clerk
and
the
judge
who
says
you
can't
get
in
to
court
unless
you
pay
the
entry
fee,
i
have
no
power
to
waive
the
statute,
but
i
can't
--
the
judicial
capacity,
we're
acting
these
administrators
and
the
federal
court
says
that
exactly
that
that
they're
acting
in
administrative
capacity
when
they
say
they
have
no
power
to
waive
the
court.
whether
the
connecticut
courts
would
have
done
anything
on
that,
i
do
not
know.
no
one
else,
they
do
and
i
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
it
as
a
group
decided
the
supreme
court.
the
only
issues
here
are
the
--
if
there
is
any
constitutional
problem
in
this
case,
it's
whether
or
not
the
entry
fees
statute
provides
equal
protection.
it
seems
necessary
to
have
these
entry
fee
statutes,
court
cost,
if
they're
reasonable
in
nature
and
do
not
impose
an
undo
burden
and
no
unfair
discrimination,
no
invidious
discrimination.
they
are
arbitrary
or
harsh,
then,
the
fall
has
been
allowed.
i
do
not
know
if
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
there
was
no
other
similar
situation
and
this
court
has
not
expanded
the
griffin
doctrine
to
situations
such
as
this.
the
civil
suit
which
doesn't
have
in
and
over
itself
for
a
no
state
participation
whatsoever,
it's
a
dispute
between
two
individuals
and
this
case
here,
if
the
judgment
was
rendered
on
this
case,
this
is
for
welfare
recipients.
hundreds
of
other
people
in
connecticut
that
are
indigent
can't
afford
it,
but
there
not
welfare
recipients.
the
judgment
of
this
case
could
well
revert
and
reverse
discrimination.
that's
why
we
say
it's
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
at
due
process,
the
parties,
the
plaintiffs
made
the
same
claim
in
the
federal
court
about
the
due
process,
but
due
process
--
this
three-judge
court
didn't
even
consider
the
issue
of
due
process.
i
think
due
process
is
pertinent
cases
of
this
type.
they
have
the
right
to
go
to
get
into
court.
the
only
thing
is
the
condition
of
getting
in
is
him
by
a
reasonably
entry
fee
as
these
entry
fees
prevails
throughout
the
united
states
or
court
cost
prevailed
throughout
the
united
states.
and
appeals
even
the
federal
statute
of
1915,
incidentally
provides
only
that
in
a
civil
case
brought
in
form
paupers,
the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
any
such
person
unable
to
employ
counsel.
there's
plenty
of
cases
on
that
and
they
have
been
interpreted
to
mean
only
that
the
court
may
request.
they
cannot
order
representation
by
counsel
such
as
they
do
in
all
civil
cases.
we
of
course
in
connecticut
have
numerous
situations
which
by
statute
or
specific
circumstances
allow
people
to
get
in
the
court
without
payment
of
fees.
where
workman's
compensation,
the
uniform
support,
that's
been
waive,
but
on
the
statute
has
been
waive
as
a
matter
of
policy
with
most
dates
and
there's
others
that
for
the
moment,
i
just
skip
my
mind.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
in
the
uniform
reciprocals
enforcement
support
act
and
yes
your
honor
and
they
waived
them
as
the
matter
of
policy
in
all
cases
that
uniform
reciprocals
support
act
provides
that
state
may
waive
the
cost.
that
is
where
they
collect
for
a
wife
in
connecticut,
a
husband
some
other
state
or
vice
versa.
a
wife
can
enforce
support
for
herself
and
the
children
by
having
proceedings
in
one
state
orders
in
the
other
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
a
notation
there
as
i
recall
it
$60.00.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but
there's
no
$60.00
fee
in
any
court
cost
in
connecticut.
it
would
be
combination
of
the
--
if
it's
$60.00,
the
combination
of
$45.00
or
entry
fee
and
the
$15.00
fee
which
the
client
owes
to
share
but
not
the
court
do
not
involved
in
this
situation
at
all.
before
it
closing,
either
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
service
or
process
against
the
defendant
citing
them
in.
served
the
living
with
him
or
as
the
usual
place
for
both,
must
be
the
resident
of
the
state.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
in
divorce,
it
probably
not
other,
but
there
is
witness
fees,
investigation
ordinary
cases,
investigation
fees
and
the
counts
of
course.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
not
in
divorce,
i
mean
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
in
divorce
fees
--
divorce
cases,
i
would
say
there's
probably
rate
cost,
the
sheriff,
the
witnesses
and
publication.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i've
never
heard
of
that
situation
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
the
service
has
to
do.
there
some
and
then
under
the
connecticut
statute
by
a
written
summons
to
appear
in
court.
now,
for
word
of
proper
form
and
were
signed
by
an
attorney
or
ordered
sign
by
a
clerk
or
judge
rather,
then
they
could
accept
service.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
without
actually
making
the
summons
or
making
actual
service
of
the
summons,
yes.
but
there's
another
statute
would
says
in
every
civil
action
shall
be
in
a
special
form.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
with
the
writ
of
summons
and
complaint.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
there's
a
90-day
waiting
period
in
connecticut.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
after
waiting
90
days
at
any
event
after
they
return
day
before
it
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
to
take
evidence
and
it's
usually
two
or
three
witnesses
requires.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
usually
two
or
three
supporting
witnesses
required.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
i
think
this
your
honor,
i
think
the
fees
are
reasonable
and
then
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
it
seems
to
me
is
by
discretionary
whereby
legislature.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
state
interest
is
only
--
i
presumed
to
prevent
frivolous
litigation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
tend
to
prevent
it
rather.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
think
that
state
has
legitimate
interest
to
waive
all
court
fees,
a
license
within
the
realm
of
the
legislature
to
do
it,
they
could
have
do
it
of
course,
but
they
have
to
provide
tax
measure
elsewhere,
thus
the
entry
fee
do,
can
or
do
help
to
support
the
judiciary
system.
as
far
as
disputes
between
the
parties
are
concerned
in
a
divorce
case,
the
state
is
a
more
on
standing
under
the
sidelines.
they
are
not
a
party
to
the
action.
they
don't
represent,
the
only
place
that
possible
in
their
state
would
get
interested
in
a
divorce
case
as
if
they
were
minor
children
on
welfare
or
in
hospital
or
mentally
retarded
institution
or
somewhat
in
that
sort,
so
welfare
standpoint.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
i
don't
know
how
they
could
or
have
a
screening
process
work
in
any
event.
if
i
intimated
that,
i
didn't
mean
it,
i
wouldn't
think
even
from
part
from
the
constitutional
questions
which
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
would
also
seem
to
be
very
commerce
and
then
workable.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
think
there
are
to
be
a
reasonably
form
of
pauper
statute
in
every
state
that
myself,
but
i
don't
know
how
it's
going
of
the
done.
there
are
so
many
factors.
there
are
so
many
situations
that
will
come
up.
i'm
sure
that
this
program,
it's
now
being
well
developed
some
good.
the
funds
appropriated.
there's
a
total
$119,000.00.
i
think
that
was
more
than
that
though
i
believe.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
pilot
--
there's
a
pilot
program
justice.
it
is
being
worked
out
through
the
welfare
department
in
hartford,
in
connecticut.
it's
a
special
legal
services
project;
a
$119,000.00
is
being
tried
out
in
two
smaller
counties
up
there
and
the
director
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
dollars.
and
they
provide
legal
services
and
their
purpose
is
as
said
by
the
acting
commission
in
welfare
is
to
enable
us
to
make
recommendations
for
program
or
policy
changes
that
our
statewide
programs
we
are
getting
this
form
of
pauper
statutes.
somebody's
got
to
pay
the
sheriff
for
publication
and
newspaper
and
things
like
that.
now,
what
--
there's
another
problem
is
to
what
appropriated
state
fund
is
going
to
be
charge
to.
we
have
statute
of
course
that
no
state
officer
can
spend
the
moneys
that
are
not
appropriated
and
other
statute
that
he
can
only
spend
the
moneys
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
appropriated.
otherwise,
this
personal
liability
on
the
officer
had
probably
other
expose
to
other
chargers.
it's
sort
of
a
complex
procedure
and
seemed
to
me
that
it's
a
matter
really
for
the
--
rather
really
for
the
legislature
and
i
think
that
the
constitutional
programs
for
questions
raised
either
are
not
too
momentous
in
view
of
the
fact
that
access
is
a
due
process
isn't
a
picture
because
access
the
court
is
not
deny,
it's
him
then
or
condition
by
a
reasonable
charge
which
is
prevails,
so
far
as
i
know
that
every
state
in
the
union
and
then
the
federal
government,
the
federal
courts.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
old
cases
have
said
so
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
old
cases
which
seemed
to
indicated
that
where
is
not
likely
they've
been
large
and
made
it
into
more
rarely
available
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
would
bar
divorce?
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
it's
purely
state
matter.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
would
think
justice
it's
purely
state
matter
the
court
may
bard
divorces
without
being
in
contravention
of
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
would
not
think
so
that
bringing
every
state
in
the
union
has
different
grounds
and
different
conditions
prevailing
in
divorce
cases.
as
far
as
connecticut
is
concerned
of
the
end
of
three
year
residence,
but
now
this
year,
they
reduced
it
to
one
year
to
show
that
their
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
understand
what's
really
at
stake
in
this
case
perhaps
it's
rather
outlined
briefly
the
procedures
followed
in
divorce
actions
are
civil
actions
in
connecticut,
all
civil
actions.
first
of
all,
of
course,
the
client
sees
the
attorney.
the
attorney
discernments
whether
it
has
a
cause
of
action
and
draws
a
writ
which
is
delivered
to
the
officer
to
make
service
at
the
expense
of
the
client
or
and
then
the
officer
returns
the
writ
to
court.
at
that
time,
the
statute
comes
into
play,
and
says
the
clerk
for
the
court
shall
charge
$45.00
for
entering
all
civil
causes.
that's
the
statute.
to
accomplish
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
it
is
necessary
that
some
provision
also
be
made
to
pay
these
auxiliary
costs
which
are
incident
to
the
divorce
cases.
very
often
there's
expensive
advertisement
or
publication
particularly
when
the
defendant
is
absent
from
the
state.
now
in
this
complaint,
another
thought
we
must
bear
in
mind,
it
seems
to
me.
in
this
complaint,
the
only
plaintiffs
are
women
on
welfares.
they
are
not
poor
people
generally.
there's
thousands
of
poor
people
as
everyone
knows
who
are
working
their
head's
off
to
try
to
make
a
living
in
case
that
they're
only
together
and
resent
or
check
on
the
welfare.
and
that
class
of
people
who's
entitled
of
relief
as
this
well
as
these
people,
if
they
are
entitled
to
relief.
at
presently,
the
court
raised
the
thought,
what
has
been
done
since
the
last
time
we
were
here?
presently,
we
find
all
inability,
welfare
women
or
other
poor
people
to
get
divorce
cases,
divorce
actions.
there
are
as
plenty
of
them
handled
by
the
legal
assistance
association.
a
great
number
of
them
are
being
handled.
we
try
to
get
some
figures
from
them
through
the
clerk
of
the
court
but
they
weren't
supplied.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
have
any
general
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
we
have
other
situations
where
no
court
fees
are
charge,
but
there
not
in
forma
pauperis
statutes.
they
apply
to
everyone
regardless
of
his
status.
there
is
this
legal
services
program
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
before
which
has
been
initiated
and
by
hew
and
the
local
welfare
department
is
an
experiment
being
carried
on
in
five
states
in
the
union.
connecticut
happens
to
be
one
of
them.
it's
a
legal
service
organization
in
the
towns
of
meriden
and
southington
and
wallingford
and
that's
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
if
the
sheriff's
fee
–
there's
no
direct
state
action
in
the
sheriff's
fee.
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
$45.00
is
what
goes
to
state
of
connecticut
as
an
entry
fee.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
and
the
statute
provides
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
they
do
and
so
is
legal
assistance.
connecticut
contributes
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
know.
at
the
beginning,
maybe
the
legal
assistance
didn't'
pay
all
the
fees.
they
don't
pay
them
now.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
understand
so,
but
depending
upon
the
judgment
of
the
director
of
the
legal
aid
assistance.
he
in
his
discretion
according
to
their
setup
can
determine
which
cases
have
the
most
significance,
and
accordingly,
they
allot
their
money
that
they
collect
from
the
federal
government
to
state
of
connecticut,
another
charitable
organizations
to
pay
the
cases
which
in
their
opinion
have
priority.
there's
the
other
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
-
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
difficulty
in
that
regard,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
please
is
that
these
are
not
state
agencies,
strictly
speaking.
a
legal
aid
assistance
association
incorporated
under
the
state
of
connecticut
pursuant
to
federal
legislation
which
recognized
and
advocated
that
these
legal
assistance
association
to
be
formed
in
conjunction
with
--
and
supported
by
the
local
bars
associations
to
provide
legal
services
for
the
poor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
pardon
me?
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
oh,
yes
your
honor.
there's
money
supplied.
i
have
the
1968
article,
certified
article
with
me.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
it's
our
opinion
that
they're
not
effectively
barred
and
they
are
a
lot
of
women
in
the
divorce
courts.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
give
you
court
assignment
here
on
september
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
there's
the
legal
aid
and
the
legal
services
programs;
two
different
programs,
each
paying
entry
fees,
each
pay
for
shares.
the
legal
aid
and
the
legal
aid
services
is
a
separate
program
just
to
initiate
the
writ
gotten
on
the
floor
since
we
argued
it
last
time.
the
first
three
or
four
months
when
that
was
organized
in
the
meriden
and
they
operate
entirely
different
way,
than
the
legal
aid
assistance
association.
they
are
not
a
corporation,
but
they
got
a
contracts
with
the
local
bar
associations.
and
they
have
a
director,
a
case
comes
in
and
it's
assigned
to
some
attorney
who
has
previously
indicated
that
he
will
accept
these
cases,
and
the
legal
aid
services
program
pays
this
attorney
a
modest
of
$16.00
an
hour
plus
the
cost
of
expenses.
and
in
meriden
and
wallingford
and
southington,
there
was
only
one
lawyer
out
of
the
whole
three
towns
which
comprised
of
our
population
of
75,000
to
100,000.
i
understand
there's
only
one
lawyer
who
didn't
signify
that
he
would
accept
to
work
along
with
this
program
because
of
age
or
infirmity
or
ill
health
for
some
reason.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
a
public
organization,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
is
state
supported
though
the
welfare
department.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
and
federal.
both
of
these
programs
are
federally
financed.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
have
to
say
with
this
proviso
your
honor
please.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
country
(ph)
fees
that
are
paid
by
the
legal
assistance
association.
mr.
lafrance's
client
or
he
formerly
was
with
the
legal
aid.
he
hasn't
been
with
them
for
over
a
year
or
more.
it
was
mr.
danford,
the
director,
who
determined
what
fees
should
be
paid
in
what
cases.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
no,
no,
i
don't.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i'm
not
saying
they
got
it.
i
don't
know
why
it
was
refused
to
him.
i
don't
know
why
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
oh,
no.
i
wouldn't
make
that
claim.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
was
refused
not
by
the
legal
aid;
it
was
refused
by
the
court,
the
state
of
connecticut
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
have
been
made
more
or
less
familiar
with
them
indirectly
on
the
legal
services
program.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
the
program
is
not
given
directly
to
the
welfare
recipient.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
is
given
to
the
welfare
department.
if
a
welfare
client
wants
legal
services
regardless
of
the
nature,
divorce
or
anything
else.
then,
they
have
two
attorneys
who
are
on
their
own
panel.
they
made
their
own
salary.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
are
free
for
the
indigent.
but
then,
there
are
additional
services
that
if
they
want
other
services
or
the
two
people
assigned
to
the
particular
job
or
rendering
legal
services
to
this
organization.
then,
the
lawyers
who
have
subscribed
as
being
willing
to
take
this
cases,
the
director
forwards
the
case
to
one
of
these
lawyers.
so
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes
and
pays
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
right.
they
get
a
lawyers
and
they
get
their
fees
paid
and
they
get
all
kinds
of
problems
and
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
is
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
we
will
admit
that.
we
don't
argue
that
fact.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
thought
the
court
--
that
the
situation
is
changed
materially
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well
justice
black,
i
have
spoken
in
the
first
instance
about
the
legal
aid
or
service
which
is
an
experimental
problem.
it's
in
the
second
year.
it's
a
pilot
program.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
designed
to
determine
whether
the
federal
government
will
go
deeper
into
this,
provided
different
kinds
of
service
in
the
legal
aids
or
adopt
some
other
made.
that's
what
i
understand
the
legal
aid
service
is.
and
there
is
only
one
community
or
three
communities
being
handled
by
the
legal
aid.
it's
a
new
program
of
the
federal
--
of
hew.
but
prior
to
that
time,
this
legal
aid
assistance
corporation
was
organized
back
in
'64,
i
believe,
and
they
are
in
turn
financed
by
the
federal
government,
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
ford
foundation,
the
maya
foundation,
and
other
charitable
contributions.
so,
here
public
monies
are
charitable
monies,
and
they
have
given
them
to
him
for
certain
purpose.
and
they
ended
the
year
in
1968
with
a
substantial
sum
and
if
these
people
made
application
for
divorce
during
that
period.
this
legal
aid
assistance
had
the
money
to
pay
for
these
and
shares
and
entry
fees
during
that
period.
and
it
must
be
a
fact
that
others
get
in
to
court.
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
at
my
request
didn't
have
the
figures,
but
he
requested
to
aid
from
assistance
from
the
legal
aid
assistance
to
give
him
the
figures,
but
we
didn't
get
them.
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
may
very
well
be
that,
that
would
be
the
problem
or
action
to
pursue,
but
we
attacked
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
maybe
i've
confused
the
court.
the
state
has
no
appropriation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but,
it
gives
executive
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
makes
a
contribution
to
these
two
organizations.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
my
understanding
of
it
from
the
best
authority
i
know
and
that
in
the
audit
of
this
plaintiff
in
1968.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
not
from
--
there
would
be
no
live
constitutional
program.
you
think
that
we
can
get
that
information
by
affidavit,
but
we
get
cooperation
if
the
number
of
people
and
so
forth
from
this
legal
aid
assistance.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
if
you
may,
it
may
please
your
honor,
mr.
lafrance
has
been
absent
for
all
due
respect
to
mr.
lafrance
from
the
state
for
sometime,
but
i
made
the
inquiry
myself
as
to
how
many
of
these
plaintiffs,
since
the
action
was
instituted
have
filed
divorce
cases.
there
are
two.
one
was
withdrawn
i
think.
mary
anne
dochures
filed
for
divorce
in
march
1970.
her
lawyer
is
jonathan
e.
silver.
jonathan
e.
silver
is
under
staff
of
the
haven
legal
assistance.
i'm
i
correct?
and
mrs.
perez
filed
her
return
before
we
were
here
or
her
divorce
application
before
we
came
to
court
the
last
time
and
is
still
on
file.
but
she's
represented
by
atty.
gallagher
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
employed
by
the
new
haven
legal
assistance.
the
legal
aid
services
of
southington
or
he
is
an
independent
attorney.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
she's
in
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
the
only
two
i
know
of.
and
i
was
informed
that
they
some
--
if
they
are
possibly
capable
of
raising
the
money
paid
to
the
legal
aid
by
installments.
otherwise,
they
use
their
own
funds
that
they
get
from
other
sources.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
didn't
mean
to
deny
the
allegations
and
complaint.
i
misunderstood
apparently
the
questions
raised
as
to
what
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
at
this
plaintiffs
are
at
denial
in
year-and-a
half
since
this
case
has
been
standing.
it
is
our
claim
of
course,
constitutionally
or
on
the
merits
that
although
23
states,
for
example,
have
in
forma
pauperis
statutes.
two
of
them
do
not
apply
to
divorce
actions.
one
state
allows
divorce
actions
for
women
only
and
i
don't'
remember
now
what
the
other
state
could
apply.
but
in
all
of
these
cases
and
including
the
federal
proper
statute
281915,
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
as
to
whether
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
pursue
in
civil
action,
a
case
without
payment
of
court
fees.
the
court
in
this
recent
case
in
washington
dc,
harris
--
there
were
two
statutes.
one
is
general
statute
allowing
residents
of
washington
dc
to
secure
divorce
action
as
general
sessions
court
i
believe
it
was.
and
then
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
281915.
in
that
case,
the
court
didn't
get
into
the
constitutional
acts
features
but
it
reconciled
the
two
statutes
and
said
that
it
is
much
as
281915
did
not
exclude
the
divorce
cases.
then
the
plaintiffs
could
proceed
under
in
forma
pauperis
regulations.
now,
divorce
as,
it
is
far
furhter
claim
trial
further
claim
that
divorce
is
not
a
matter
of
fundamental
right.
it's
not
within
the
framework
and
can
man
of
the
constitution.
we
get
notations
like
goldberg
and
sniadach
and
other
cases
involved
in
due
process,
although,
there
are
civil
factors
involved.
they
are
to
my
opinion
nevertheless
rights,
the
one
wages.
wages
is
a
--
person
who
is
more
dependent
about
his
wages
every
week.
as
a
general
rule
then
if
a
person
who
has
money
in
the
bank.
there's
a
distinct
difference
there
and
to
deprive
and
attach
wages
is
as
the
court
said
a
brutal
blow,
but
wages
incidentally
haven't
been
attach
in
connecticut
for
years
and
years.
and
we
got
into
the
other
cases
on
equal
protection
and
so
forth.
equal
protection
of
life,
liberty
and
property.
the
equal
protection
has
to
--
the
item
under
consideration
has
to
attach
to
one
of
those
factors.
the
item
for
liberty
or
property.
in
goldberg
case
of
course,
it
was
liberty
that
was
due
process.
but
we
have
submitted
our
argument
in
the
first
brief.
we
have
now
relying
on
furthermore
on
the
dandridge
versus
williams's
case
which
is
the
reduction
of
the
maximum
welfare
benefits
due
to
families
of
over
five
or
six
was
decided
on
equal
protection,
and
i
think
that
case
fits
very
well
into
this
case.
assuming
it
is,
it's
--
there's
a
rationality
behind
the
procedure
adopted
by
the
state.
that
is
that
it's
reasonable
to
expect
that
persons
use
in
the
courts
will
pay
some
of
the
expense
of
maintaining.
that
is
done
in
every
state
in
the
federal
state
court
and
then
the
federal
courts
as
well
in
this
country
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
the
factual
situation,
i'll
have
to
admit
this
that
the
factual
situation
which
you
used
today
had
existed
when
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
we
haven't
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
but
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
probably
we
had
a
lot
of
cases
from
this
haven
legal
assistance
association.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
couldn't
answer
that.
i'll
have
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
she
personally,
i
will
concede
that
she
is
probably
unable
to
put
up
the
$45.00.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
because
it's
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
is
correct.
because
the
welfare
department
does
not
give
welfare
recipient
direct
money
for
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
my
understanding
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
can
prove
it
now,
but
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
not
applied
to
the
individuals,
no
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
can
just
show
an
expenditures
sums
for
fees
and
cost.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
i
think
i
would.
i
got
an
honest
certified
attorney
of
the
new
haven
legal
assistance
can
show
us
an
expenditure
of
several
thousand
dollars
or
$6,000.00
plus
for
fees
and
costs
in
litigation.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
in
all
kinds
of
cases
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
it's
not
broken
down
not
if
i
knew.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
excuse
me,
your
honor.
it's
all
cases,
but
it's
not
broken
down
in
this
audit
is
not
broken
down
by
--
i
got
flat
transcripts
and
costs,
total
$6,000.00
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
$6,000.00
plus.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
transcripts
and
costs.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
there's
no
criminal
fees;
we
have
public
defender
system
in
connecticut
on
public
and
criminal.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
not
necessarily
restricted
to
civil
cases.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
includes
and
it
indicates
a
surplus
on
hand
at
the
end
of
the
season.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you
