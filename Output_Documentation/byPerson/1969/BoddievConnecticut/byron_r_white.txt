mr.
lafrance,
i
gathered
the
sums
involved
here
are
minimum
about
$45.00
and
a
maximum
about
$200.00.is
that
right?
justice
byron

--
the
facts
targeting.
justice
byron

$60.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
prevail
of
those
cases,
how
do
we
contain
a
decision
to
just
divorce
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
involved
in
take
a
negligence
actions
--
any
kind
of
civil
actions,
contract
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
right
to
travel,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
hunting
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
dog
house
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
provision
the
constitution
do
you
claim
affords
the
right
to
have
access
to
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
redress
of
grievances
from
about
whom,
about
official
action
or
about
private
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
note
the
button
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
state
is
constitutional
required
provide
a
form
or
litigating
any
claim
of
one
private
person
against
another.
it
may
not
say
that
that
like
our
courts
are
courts
of
limited
of
jurisdiction
and
to
have
jurisdiction
decides
some
kind
of
--
to
hear
some
kind
of
claims
but
not
others.
there
are
just
some
kind
things
that
at
lead
to
the
private
sector
workout
the
best
they
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
say
the
equal
protection
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
saying
that
this
is
just
a
burden
on
a
constitutional
right
unless
you
can
say
that
the
constitutional
right
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand,
but
that's
preminence
on
their
being
a
constitutional
right
to
be
in
burden
and
you
say
the
constitutional
right
here
is
a
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
by
filling
a
suit
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
concededly
not
because
anybody
is
agreed
to
what
the
state's
done
to
them,
but
because
of
their
dissatisfaction
was
to
conduct
of
some
other
private
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
--
that
might
make
sense
if
they
were
bringing
a
suit
to
a
--
how
did
the
suits
start
out?
the
suit
started
out
by
our
sending
divorce
papers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
what
we
did
is
tend
amount
to
precisely
that
because
attach
to
our
divorce
papers,
we
asked
the
state
of
connecticut
to
waive
the
filling
fees
and
arrange
service
of
process
for
these
papers.
now,
prior
to
our
doing
that,
there
was
no
ruling
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
said
that
the
courts
lack
the
power
to
do
so.
once
their
ruling
became
apparent,
we
then
raised
the
issue
by
raising
the
constitutionality
of
the
clerk's
action
with
the
superior
court
judge,
ms.judge
longo
and
the
supreme
court
administrator,
justice
carter.
so
i
suppose
that
we've
done
precisely
what
you
have
suggested.
justice

it's

byron

white
not
state
supported?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cannon,
putting
it
in
another
way,
i
think
what
we're
concerned
about
is
whether
today,
mrs.
boddie
and
her
co-plaintiffs
are
barred
from
the
connecticut
courts
with
respect
to
their
divorce
actions.
