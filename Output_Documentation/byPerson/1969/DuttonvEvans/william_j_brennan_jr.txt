justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
evans
was
tried
separately--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
not
a
joint
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is,
it’s
the
right
of
the
accused
if
he
wanted
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
evans
was
tried
separately.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
williams
was
tried
separately?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
truett
was
not
tried
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
turned
state
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
equivalence
of
that
rule
that
this
conspiracy
exception
continues
after
the
crime
has
been
committed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
what
the
new
code
of
evidence
promulgated
by
judicial
conference
committee
says
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
bruton
hold?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
what
bruton--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gave
the
confrontation
clause
to
statements
of
a
co-defendant,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
bruton
at
least
said
that,
in
some
situations,
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
satisfied
simply
by
confronting
a
witness
on
the
stand,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
that
these
two
men
have
been
tried
together
by
williams
and
evans
that
if
williams’
statement
had
been
admissible
at
the
trial,
he’d
be
happy
to
testify?
i
mean,
an
exception,
would
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bruton
just
wouldn’t
cover
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
an
argument,
mr.
evans,
if
williams
had
taken
the
stand--
if
they
had
been
tried
jointly
and
williams
had
taken
the
stand
and
had
testified
as
he
did
here
and
said--
put
these
words
in
evans’
mouth
that
bruton
would
not
have
applied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let’s
put
it
this
way
then.
williams
did
not
take
the
stand
but
they
introduced
a
confession
of
williams
against
williams
which
contain
this
statement
of
williams
about
evidence.
would
bruton
there
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
williams
had
told
shaw
“yes,
we
did
it.
i
was
party
to
it.”
and
then
had
said
what
he
did
about
evidence.
because
this
was
not
said
to
a
police
officer
but
to
shaw,
bruton
would
not
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bruton
didn’t
address
itself
to
the
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
saved
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
co-defendant--
if
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
shown
in
bruton,
then
that
would
be
a
different
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what’s
the
basis
of
the
distinction,
mr.
evans,
whether
the
confession
is
made
through
a
public
officer
or
to
someone
else,
what’s
the
basis
for
that
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
the
basis
for
the
co-conspirator
exception
to
hearsay
rule
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
that
means
is
that
you
can
describe
the
co-conspirator
statement
to
the
defendant
himself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don’t
think
there’s
anything
in
the
fact
that
there’s
some
substitute
for
cross-examination
in
this
exception
maybe
that
there’s
some
indicia
of
reliability
so
that
you
don’t
need
cross-examination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
such
as
in
a
state
it
is
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
an
admission
against--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
another
exception
entirely,
isn’t
it,
to
the
co--
in
addition
to
the
co-conspirator
exception?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
williams’
testimony
would’ve
been
admissible?
say,
the
rule
in
georgia
were
the
rule
in
federal
court
as
far
as
the
co-conspirator
is
concerned.
would
this
statement
by
williams
to
shaw
have
been
admissible
anyway
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
declaration
against
penal
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
argument
goes
in
that
direction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
evans,
hasn’t
this
really
boiled
around
an
argument
that
any
hearsay
statement
of
which
it
can
be
said
they’re
indicia
of
trustworthiness
is
admissible
without
regard
to
whether
it’s
within
any
of
the
exceptions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
trend
you
mentioned
earlier,
to
admit
hearsay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
it
rests
in
part,
doesn’t
it,
on
questions
of
the
trustworthiness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
liability
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
take
the
situation
that
was
involved
in
pointer
against
texas
would
meet
with
your--
how
would
that
get
into
what
you’re
suggesting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
ensure
that
there’ll
be
a
live
witness--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
subject
to
confront--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
would
be
confronted
and
cross-examined.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
also,
i--
perhaps
i’m
mistaken,
but
my
impression
is
that
the
rule
doesn’t
come
into
play
at
all
in
the
federal
system
unless
the
charge
is
a
conspiracy
charge
and,
in
here,
there
was
no
charge
of
conspiracy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
wasn’t
it
a
co-conspirator,
was
it
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
a
co-conspirator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
evans
was
tried
separately--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
not
a

william
j.

that
