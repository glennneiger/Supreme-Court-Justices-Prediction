the
statute
to
which
you
refer
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
fact
that
conspiracy
shall
be
proven.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
has
this
statute
been
on
the
books?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
an
enactment
by
the
georgia
legislature,
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
it
codifies
the
decisional
law
in
this
area
and
then
submits
it
to
the
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
statute
is
written.
it
is
the
conventional
co-conspirator
rule,
is
it
not?
it
is
written
and
it’s
the
palimony
of
the
gloss,
the
judicial
gloss
is
put
down
during
the
period
of
the
conspiracy.
it
runs
to
the
point
where
the
concealment
period
as
well
as
the
operational
period
of
the
conspiracy.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
federal
rule--
justice
potter
stewart
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rule,
statements
of
one
co-conspirator
made
during
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
hearsay
during
the
course
of
it
but,
during
the
course
of
it
it’s,
by
judicial
gloss,
extended
to
the
period
of
concealments
of
thought
as
well
as
the
active
operations.
isn’t
it
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that’s--
well,
the
chief
justice’s
example
is
quite
a
different
and
distinct
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.,
the
dying
declaration
exception.
it
doesn’t
purport
to
come
with
under
the
conspiracy
exception.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
answer
was
that
would
be
inadmissible
because
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
hypothetical,
he--
williams
dying
on
the
floor
where
he
said
exactly
the
same
words
as
he
said
here,
and
if
these
words
are
irrelevant
then
the
same
words
would
be
equally
relevant,
wouldn’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
you
must
necessarily
be
talking
about
here
is
not
that--
you
got
to
argue
more
than
that
the
georgia
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
perhaps
too
broad.
you
have
to
argue
necessarily,
since
you’re
in
a
federal
court
here,
you’ve
got
to
argue
that
it
violates
some
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
hypothetical
question,
would
you
also
think
that
the
dying
declaration
exception,
under
circumstances
that
he
described,
would--
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
prevent
the
admission
of
a
statement
made
under
the
conditions
he
described?
justice
potter
stewart
had
the
bruton
case
been
decided
here
at
the
time
that
this
present
case
was
considered
by
the
georgia
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
remember
if
it’s
discussed
and
is
distinguished
in
the
georgia
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
purport
of
the
statement
as
you
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is.
do
you
understand
it
as
implying
that
evans
was
the
ringleader?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
statement
itself.
is
that
the--
is
that
its
impact?
“if
it
hadn’t
been
for
that
sob
alex
evans,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
this
now.”
justice
potter
stewart
the
other--
the
evidence--
the
other
evidence
was,
as
i
so
read
it,
while
evans
was
certainly
a
participant,
i’m
talking
now
about
the
eyewitness
testimony
of
the
participant
who
turn
states
evidence,
that
while
evans
was
a
participant,
it
was
actually
williams
who
was
the
triggerman,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you--
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
have
called
shaw?
or,
no--
shaw
testified,
didn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
could
you
call
williams?
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
that
right
under
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
can
call
him
on
cross-examination,
for
the
purposes
of
the
cross-examination?
justice
potter
stewart
and
convicted.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
had
the,
at
least
the
power,
the
right
to
call
him
as
a
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
and
subpoena.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
not
exercise
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
not
try
to
exercise
it.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
have
called
him
on
cross-examination?
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.,
as
an
adverse
witness.
justice
potter
stewart
would
not.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
all
shaw
testified
to?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
one
other
question.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
client
now
under
sentence
of
death?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
you’re
opponent
wins,
it
will
be
much
more
than
a
commutation.
it
will
be
a
new
trial
or--
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
the

to
which
you
