mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
hearsay
rule
is
to
be
read
into
and
equated
with
this
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
factual
setting
in
which
the
setting
arose
was
petitioner
evans’
trial
for
murder
in
connection
with
the
slaying
of
three
police
officers
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
the
principal
witness
for
the
state
was
wade
truett,
an
accomplice
who
turns
state
evidence.
truett
has
testified
as
an
eyewitness
to
all
material
details
of
the
triple
slaying.
truett’s
testimony
is
not
here
in
question
and
i
will
not
go
into
it
in
great
detail.
however,
i
do
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to
touch
upon
the
highlights
of
his
testimony.
after
relating
the
essential
elements
of
a
car
theft
conspiracy,
truett
testified
how
long
with
the
petitioner
evans
and
one
venson
eugene
williams,
they
stole
a
car
in
atlanta,
georgia.
the
stolen
car
was
driven
to
a
rural
location
in
nearby
gwinnett
county
where
they
decided
they
would
change
the
license
place--
plates
and
the
ignition
switch.
while
in
the
process
of
changing
the
plates
and
the
switch,
they
were
apprehended
by
the
three
soon-to-die
police
officers.
unfortunately,
the
youngest
officer,
while
bending
over
the
front
seat
of
the
car
to
examine
the
ignition
switch,
put
himself
in
such
a
position
as
to
enable
evans
to
remove
his
revolver.
evans
ordered
all
three
officers
to
raise
their
hands.
they
were
then
disarmed
and
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs.
at
this
point,
truett
took
the
police
car
and
drove
it
off
into
the
woods
for
concealment.
as
he
was
returning
to
the
spot
where
evans
and
williams
were
with
the
three
police
officers,
he
heard
what
sounded
to
him
to
be--
he
described
it
as
a
nickel
pack
of
firecrackers
going
off.
upon
his
arrival,
he
saw
the
police
officers
on
the
ground
still
handcuffed
together.
one
police
officer
was
making
a
peculiar
sound.
he
then
saw
williams
bend
over
and
fire
two
or
three
more
times
into
the
police
officer
while
evans
held
the
flashlight.
truett’s
testimony
was
corroborated
by
physical
evidence
as
well
as
the
evidence
of
other
witnesses.
it
is
a
testimony
of
one
of
the
corroborating
witnesses
which
gives
rise
to
the
questions
which
are
presented
to
the
court
today.
the
witness
in
question
is
linwood
shaw.
shaw
was
a
fellow
inmate
of
venson
eugene
williams
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
the
time
williams
was
arraigned
for
the
murder.
on
the
day
following
his
arraignment,
shaw
asked
williams
how
he
made
out.
the
rather
spontaneous
exclamation
reply
was
“if
it
hadn’t
been
for
that
dirty
sob
alex
evans,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
this
now.”
the
testimony
was
admitted
over
objection.
the
trial
court
based
its
ruling
upon
the
fact
that
the
state,
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court,
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
an
auto
theft
conspiracy
and
the
statement
was
therefore
admissible
under
the
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
for
co-conspirators,
an
exception
which
is
provided
by
statute
in
georgia.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
georgia,
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this,
it
is
a
matter
of
right
that
the
accused
can
have
a
separate
trial.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
they
were
tried
separately.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
truett
was
not
tried.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
turned
state
evidence
and
there
was
a
grant
of
immunity.
there
was
full
disclosure
of
that
fact
to
the
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
exception
was
that
the
state
had
shown
a
prima
facie
conspiracy
to
steal
automobiles.
the
rule
in
georgia,
as
i
think
in
virtually
all
other
states
and
in
the
federal
system,
is
that
the
statement
of
a
co-conspirator
is
admissible
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
it
was
admitted
on
this
basis,
that
it
was
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
is
one
printed
error
in
that.
it
should
read
“upon
the
showing
of
the
fact.”
i
think
in
the
printing
of
it,
it
came
out
“facts.”
it
should
be
singular
of
course.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
is,
of
course--
i--
this
is
a
distinction
between
what
i
believe
is
a
majority
rule
in
the
states
and
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts.
this
court,
in
cases
such
as
krulewitch,
decided
that
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
is
at
an
end
upon
the
last
overt
act.
in
krulewitch,
this
court
expressly
noted
that
the
view
was
to
the
contrary
in
many
states,
including
georgia.
the
court
noted
that
georgia’s
rule
was
different.
there
was
no
criticism
of
the
georgia
rule
and
the
court
clearly,
as
i
see
it,
indicated
that
it
was
ruling
on
a
rule
of
evidence
to
be
applied
in
federal
courts
and
not
a
constitution
standard.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
no,
sir.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
new
code
on--
of
the
federal
committee
has
to
say.
i
know
the
trend
in
most
of
the
model
codes
has
been
to
either
terminate,
abrogate,
or
greatly
restrict
the
present
hearsay
rule.
the
trend
has
been
against
the
exclusion
of
hearsay.
that
has
been
the
trend
in
most
model
codes.
in
any
event,
this
evidence
was
admitted.
petitioner
evans
was
convicted.
he
raised
the
issue,
among
others,
in
his
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
having
exhausted
his
direct
appeals,
petitioner
evans
turned
to
the
united
states
district
court
where
he
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
the
writ,
citing
wigmore
to
the
effect
that
the
evidentiary
rule
and
the
constitutional
standard
are
not
the
same,
and
that
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
describe
what
kinds
of
testimonial
statements
may
be
given
by
a
witness
who
is
on
the
stand
and
is
available
for
cross-examination.
upon
appeal,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
the
matter.
unlike
wigmore,
unlike
the
district
court,
and
i
think
unlike
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
constitutional
standard
as
one
which
incorporates
the
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence
known
as
hearsay,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
stop
where
the
generally
recognized
exceptions
to
the
rule
begin.
to
the
contrary,
it
said
that,
in
the
future,
all
stated--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
there’s
a
very
interesting
footnote
in
bruton.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bruton,
of
course
the--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
statement
of
a
co-defendant
and
it
was
a
confession,
if
you
will,
of
a
co-defendant
in
a
trial
which
we
think
is
a
situation
quite
different
from
this.
and,
bruton
expressly
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
the
decision,
i
think
a
very
important
footnote,
it
stated
that
the
evidence
there
in
question
was
not
admissible
under
any
recognized
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
and,
in
bruton,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
did
not
mean
to
imply
in
any
manner
whatsoever
that
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
necessarily
raise
problems
under
the
confrontation
clause.
in
so
doing,
it
cited
wigmore,
the
particular
section
on
which
we
rely
in
wigmore,
and
it
also
cited
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
in
mattox
in
which
we
also
rely.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
probably
some
overlap.
in
this
court,
it
is
a
difficult
task,
but
i
think
the
task
for
this
court
is
to
delineate
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause.
of
course,
this
was
somewhat
an
academic
matter
prior
to
pointer
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
first
applied
to
the
states.
until
that
time,
it
really
didn’t
matter
too
much
to
the
federal
criminal
defendant
whether
his
reversal
was
based
upon
a
procedural
rule
of
hearsay
or
the
confrontation
clause.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that,
hence,
for
all
state
exceptions
would
have
to
continually
scrutinized
and
re-evaluated
and
that
the
state
exceptions
would
be
permitted
only
where
supported
by
salient
and
cogent
reasons.
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
in
the
case
at
bar
were
not
sufficiently
salient
or
cogent,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
saying
that
the
georgia
statutory
exception,
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
as
applied
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
at
bar,
violated
evans’
confrontation
rights.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
four
reasons
why
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
ought
to
be
reversed.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
elevated
that
ancient
and
much
maligned
exclusionary
rule,
known
as
the
hearsay
rule,
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
mandate.
the
view
stated
by
wigmore,
which
we
think
to
be
the
correct
view
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
the
constitution,
does
not
deal
with
the
questions
of
what
kinds
of
testimonial
statements
must
be
given
infra-judicially,
this
being
dependent
upon
the
law
of
evidence
for
the
time
being,
but
only
upon
what
procedure
shall
be
followed,
which
is
of
course
a
cross-examining
procedure
by
the
old--
which,
as
to
that
testimony
which
is
required
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
to
be
given
infra-judicially.
this
appears
to
be
the
view
which
this
court
followed
in
mattox
versus
united
states
where
it
pointed
out
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
designed
primarily
to
exclude
ex
parte
affidavits
and
depositions,
but
not
to
go
to
the
competency
of
testimony
of
a
witness
who
does
appear
in
court
and
is
available
for
cross-examination.
i’ve
already
pointed
out
that,
in
bruton,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
evidence
there
in
question
was
not
recognized
by
any
exception
to
the
rule
and
that
it--
the
court
intimated
no
view
whatever
that
hearsay
exceptions
necessarily
raise
questions
under
the
confrontation
clause,
and
it
cited
a
particular
provision
of
wigmore
to
which
i
refer
and
also
to
the
mattox
decision
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
we
urge
the
court
not
to
read
the
hearsay
rule
with
or
without
exceptions
into
the
confrontation
clause.
we
think
it
is
a
rule
singularly
undeserving
of
the
honor.
it
is
unknown--
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
in
any
system
of
jurisprudence
other
than
the
annual
jackson
system,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
has
been
roundly
criticized
by
every
scholar
of
our
system.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
i
think
that--
as
i
re--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
bruton
applies.
in
the
first
place,
wigmore
and
the
other
authorities
usually
distinguish
between
a
confession
which
is
an
admission
as
to
every
material
element
of
the
crime
and
other
admissions
and,
particularly,
of
course
you
have
the
situation
in
bruton
where
the
confession
was
to
police
authorities.
i
think
it
was
a
postal
authority
in
bruton,
as
i
recall
it.
now,
we
think
that
the
situation
respecting
the
confession,
particularly
a
confession
to
public
authorities
is
quite
different
from
an
admission--
actually,
i
don’t
know
how
much
an
admission
this
statement
was.
to
me,
it’s
a
rather
cryptic
statement
but,
presumably,
an
admission
against
penal
interest
at
best.
we
think
the
situation
is
quite
different.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don’t
think
bruton
would
have
applied
because,
as
i
read
bruton,
it
applies
to
confessions
and
particularly
confessions
to
police
officers.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
would
possibly
apply
if
the
confession
had
been
made
to
police
officers.
i
think
the
distinction
is
this,
mr.
justice
brennan.
a
confession
made
to
police
officers
obviously
cannot
be
consistent
with
the
conspiracy.
it
is
a
negation
of
a
conspiracy.
it
ends
the
conspiracy.
i
don’t
think
this
is
necessarily
the
same
as
a
confession
to
a
fellow
inmate
in
a
prison,
who,
one
might
assume,
would
not,
as
it
were,
spill
the
beans.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
situations
plus
the
fact
that,
here,
this
statement,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
could
be
considered
full
confession.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course,
this
issue
has
never
been
decided.
i
personally
would
urge
that
rule.
yes,
sir,
because
i
would
urge
that
comes
in
the
co-conspirator
exception
if
it’s
made
to
a
prisoner
during
the
concealment
period
when
the
conspiracy
is
still
in
effect.
in
other
words,
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
bruton--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
bruton--
as
i
read
bruton,
it
addressed
itself--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
confession
were
made,
i
would
say,
during
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
and
if
it
were
made
to
a
person
other
than
a
public
authority,
such
as--
i
think
you’d
have
to--
you’d
have
to
get
into
the
facts
of
the
particular
situation,
but
i
think
it
would
be
possible
that
it
would
be
admissible
under
bruton.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
basis
of
the
distinction
would
be
that,
in
a
conspiracy
situation,
it
is
consistent
with
continuation
of
the
conspiracy
to
have
a
statement
made
to
another
individual.
it
is
consistent
with
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy.
however,
if
it’s
made--
if
there
is
a
confession
to
a
police
officer,
i
think
that
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
continuance
of
a
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
ordinarily,
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
other
way.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
the
traditional
view
has
been
along
an
agency
theory
that
when
people
are
acting
together
to
accomplish
an
illegal
purpose
that
the
acts
and
statements
of
one
party
are
admissible
in
evidence
against
all
other
parties
because
they’re
working
together
as
agents,
and
of
course
the
law
has
always
taken
a
view
that
there
is
something
more
inherently
evil
about
a
combination
to
commit
crime
than
the
perpetration
by
a
single
individual.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it’s
a
rule
of
evidence.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
this
particular
state
and
i
think--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
in
this
particular
statement,
to
go
into
the
question
of
trustworthiness
which,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
usual
justifications
for
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
i
think
that
this
statement
is
probably
trustworthy
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
a
long
narrative
in
which
the
danger
of
error
in
the
retelling
would
be
very
great.
it’s
a
specific
response
to
a
very
specific
question.
now,
if
the
witness
had
testified
as
to
a
physical
impression
such
as
anger,
flushed
face,
i
think
no
one
would
question
that
that
would
be
admissible.
is
there
any
good
reason
for
discriminating
against
auditory
perceptions
in
favor
of
a
visual
perception
when
the
statement
is
so
brief,
so
short?
i
think
not.
secondly,
it
is
a
statement
which
is
against
the
penal
interest
of
the
declarant.
this
is
a
statement
which
ordinarily
would
not
be
made,
i
think,
unless
true.
finally,
when
you
compare
it
to
the
other
recognized
exceptions--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i’m
saying
that--
i’m
saying
why
this
particular
statement
in
the
case
at
hand
i
think
is
trustworthy,
for
what
it’s
worth.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
really
cannot
answer
that.
that
was
not
the
grounds
urged
by
counsel
and,
therefore,
i
can’t
answer
what
the
rule--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
my
argument
goes
in
that
direction
for
purposes
of
demonstrating,
i
hope,
to
the
court
that
the
statement
was
trustworthy,
only
for
a
demonstration.
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
exceptions
such
as
dying
declaration.
i
would
think
the
statement
like
this
is
at
least
trustworthy
as
a
dying
declaration.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
sir,
if
there
is
an
error
in
hearsay,
i
do--
i
agree.
i
do
not
think
it
necessarily
reaches
a
problem
with
constitutional
dimensions
if
there’s
an
error
in
the
admission
of
hearsay.
of
course,
it
is
always
true
in
hearsay
that
hearsay
per
se
relates
to
the
declara--
to
an
out-of-court
declaration.
so,
to
that
extent,
anytime
there’s
any
hearsay.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
trustworthiness--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
trustworthiness
and
also
the
general
feeling
that,
after
all,
the
purpose
of
evidence
is
to
shed
light
and
many
judges
have
written
that
they
feel
that
the
suppression
of
hearsay,
more
often
than
not,
keeps
light
off
the
matter
under
investigation
and
that
it
causes
more
damages
than
good.
in
any
event,
the
test
has
been
roundly
criticized
by
all
legal
scholars
and
we
feel
that
it
would
be
a
pity
if
the
reformers
have
to
fight
the
constitutional
standard
as
well
as
what
we
think
is
far
too
many
hearings
of
inertia.
now,
while
we
think
the
primary
legal
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
its
equating
of
the
evidentiary
rule
and
constitutional
standard,
we
feel
that
the
far
greater
mischief
potential
in
its
decision
was
the
test
it
set
forth
for
review
by
federal
judges
of
the
application
state
exceptions.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
no
matter
how
settled
a
state
exception
might
be,
its
application
by
a
state
judge
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
is
subject
to
reversal
by
a
reviewing
federal
judge
if
the
federal
judge
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
in
the
particular
case
for
the
adherence
to
state
law
were
not
sufficiently
salient
or
cogent.
in
reality,
this
is
just
a
pure
second
guessing
test.
the
entirely
subjective
nature
of
this
test,
we
think,
contribute
only
further
to
the
lamentable
trend
for
state
criminal
proceedings
to
be
conducted
as
ping
pong
matches
between
state
and
federal
tribunals.
we
hope,
first
and
foremost,
that
this
court
will
decline
to
elevate
the
hearsay
rule
to
a
constitutional
standard.
but,
should
the
court
disagree,
we
hope
at
the
very
minimum
that
the
court
will
provide
some
intelligible
object
of
standards
so
that
trial
judges--
state
trial
judges
may
have
some
idea
as
to
how
to
conduct
criminal
trials
when
the
question
of
hearsay
arises.
we
think
this
much
is
necessary
to
the
orderly
disposition
of
state
criminal
trials.
now,
i’ve
already
dealt
very
briefly
with
the
distinction
between--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course,
pointer--
the
decision
of
pointer
versus
texas
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
wigmore
rule.
the
wigmore
rule
is
that
confrontation
relates
to
the
procedure,
by
which
evidence
is
placed
before
a
jury.
pointer
involved
a
transcript.
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
hearsay--
excuse
me,
of
the
confrontation
standard
is
to
prevent
trials
upon
depositions
and
ex
parte
affidavits.
i
recognize
that
even
to
this
rule,
the
confrontation
rule,
there
are
exceptions,
but
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
not
going
to
the
question
of
the
competency
of
this
testimony.
that
is
the
traditional,
what
i
call,
the
wigmore
rule
which
i
think
is
a
traditional
rule
which
this
court
has
followed
in
past
decisions.
in
stine
versus
new
york
and
said
it
would
not
read
the
hearsay
rule
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
of
course
the
problem
if
we
are
wrong,
if
this
court
decides
that
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
confrontation
clause
are
to
be
equated,
you
then
reach,
i
think,
the
exceedingly
difficult
problem
of
how
to
treat
long
standing
state
exceptions
to
the
rule,
particularly
this
problem
is
acute
where
the
state
and
the
federal
rule
vary.
this
is
a
situation
with
respect
to
the
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
hearsay
clause.
i’ve
already
mentioned
that
in
krulewitch.
this
court
took
the
view
that
the
conspiracy
ends
upon
completion
of
the
last
overt
act
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
until
one
year
ago,
there
was
no
general
crime
of
conspiracy
in
georgia.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
an
evidentiary
rule,
no
question
about
that.
finally,
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
has
been
constitutional
error
we
think,
in
this
case
it
is,
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt,
harmless
error.
this
man
was
convicted
upon
the
testimony
of
wade
truett,
an
eyewitness.
the
record
shows
ample
corroboration
both
by
physical
evidence
and
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses.
we
think
that
even
under
chapman,
the
ruling
of
chapman
that
the
error
here,
if
error
existed,
was
harmless
error
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
like
to
save
what
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
comment
only
on
two
matters.
first,
dealing
with
the
last
question,
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
that
if
the
case
should
be
remanded,
witherspoon
would
be
applied
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
be
a
death
penalty.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
held
in
the
case,
this
has
already
been
held
in
the
williams
case
and
we
would
concede
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
commutation
of
the
penalty
to
life
in
prison,
yes,
sir.
secondly,
i
would
just
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
furtherance--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
because
the--
in
the
williams
case,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
the
application
of
witherspoon.
in
this
case,
they
held
a
new
trial
was
required
because
of
a
denial
of
confrontation
and
said,
therefore,
they
did
not
reach
witherspoon.
however,
they
suggested
upon
retrial
that
the
court
consider
these
problems.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
will
be
required.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
i
suppose--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
right,
it
will
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
but
it
will
be
commuted.
there’s
no
question.
it
will
be
commuted.
the
other--
my
only
other
comment
has
to
do
with
the
furtherance
rule.
there
are
many
variants
of
furtherance
in
the
various
states.
the
georgia
view
is--
they
interpret
it.
they
don’t
use
the
word
“furtherance.”
they
say
“relevancy.”
in
our
brief,
we
cite
a
federal
court
which
interpreted
“furtherance”
exactly
the
same
way.
i
think
that
it
is
not
the
rule
anywhere
that
i
know
of
that
the
actual
statement
itself
must
further
conspiracy.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
that
it
relates
to
acts
taking
place
during
a
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
black,
there
were
many
errors
alleged
in
the--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course
if
the
new
trial
is
granted,
yes,
this
is
so.
if
the
new
trial
is
granted
then,
of
course,
you
would
have
a
new
jury
and,
in
that
case,
the
wither--
there
might--
could
be
a
death
penalty
if
the
new
trial
is
granted.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i’m
assuming
that,
on
remand,
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
under
this
trial,
the
trial
which
we
have
had,
witherspoon
is
applicable.
of
course,
if
there
is
a
new
trial,
presumably,
the
district
attorney
would
examine
the
witness
in
such
a
way
as
to
comport
to
witherspoon.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
problems
which
stand
from
the
relationship
between
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
issues
arose
during
the
trial
of
the
--
here
appellee,
alex
evans
for
murder
in
connection
with
slaying
of
three
police
officers
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
evans
was
convicted
primarily
by
the
testimony
of
one
wade
truett,
an
accomplice
who
turned
state’s
evidence.
truett
was
an
eyewitness
to
all
the
material
details
of
the
client
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
murder
was
on
the
evening
about
april
17,
1964.
the
trial
was
approximately
a
little
over
a
year
later
in
october
1965.
in
any
event
as
i
was
saying
truett
testified
as
to
all
material
details
of
the
triple
slaying.
truett’s
testimony
is
not
here
in
question
and
shan’t
go
into
it
in
great
detail.
however,
i
do
think
it
might
be
appropriate
to
summarize
a
few
of
the
highlights
so
as
to
put
the
issues
which
i
will
come
to
discuss
in
their
proper
factual
context.
according
to
truett,
he,
evans,
and
venson
eugene
williams
have
been
engaged
in
a
plan
in
concert
of
action
to
steal
automobiles.
the
basic
nature
of
the
plan
was
as
follows:
they
would
first
purchase
a
vehicle
which
had
been
wrecked
beyond
the
point
where
it
could
be
commercially
repaired.
by
this,
i
mean
to
commercially
repair
a
wrecked
vehicle
entails
the
purchase
of
spare
automotive
parts.
they
would
first
purchase
a
vehicle
which
was
so
badly
repaired
that
the
purchase
of
the
automotive
parts
would
cost
more
and
they
could
recover
on
the
subsequent
resale
of
the
vehicle.
that
was
the
first
step
of
their
operation.
the
second
step
was
to
steal
an
identical
vehicle.
by
doing
this,
they
could
pirate
the
required
parts
from
the
stolen
vehicle,
put
them
on
direct
vehicle
and
sell
it
at
very
a
substantial
profit.
in
addition,
they
could
use
the
spare
parts
of
the
stolen
vehicle
for
resale
and
make
a
profit
on
these
parts
as
well.
in
pursuing
this
plan,
it’s
important
to
note
that
cars
were
stolen
before
at
the
time
of
and
after
the
slaying
of
the
three
police
officers.
the
slaying
itself
grew
out
of
the
theft
of
an
automobile.
the
car
in
question
was
an
oldsmobile.
it
was
stolen
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
april
17,
1964
following
their
ordinary
course
of
operations;
they
drove
the
automobile
to
a
rural
location
in
nearby
gwinnett
county,
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
as
quickly
as
possible
changing
the
ignition
and
also
the
license
plates
on
the
car.
while
they
were
doing
this,
a
person
in
the
vicinity
saw
the
lights
and
it
was
a
little
bit
unusual
in
this
particular
area
of
gwinnett
county,
so
he
called
the
police.
the
police
dispatched
three
officers
in
a
car
to
investigate.
the
police
officers
arrived
and
apprehended
the
three
criminals.
then
unfortunately,
the
youngest
police
officer
made
a
bad
mistake
which
was
to
cause
him
and
the
two
other
officers
of
their
lives.
he
bent
over
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
to
examine
the
ignition
switch.
as
he
was
doing
this,
he
apparently
was
a
little
bit
careless
about
where
evans
was.
evans
was
standing
near
him
as
he
was
bending
over;
evans
managed
to
grab
his
revolver,
his
police
revolver.
he
ordered
all
of
the
officers
to
put
their
hands
up
which
they
did.
the
officers
were
promptly
disarmed
and
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs.
at
this
point,
either
evans
or
williams
told
truett
to
get
the
police
car
off
the
road.
truett
backed
the
police
car
off
the
road
into
a
field.
as
he
returned
to
where
the
officers
were,
he
heard
what
sound
to
him
like
a
pack
of
firecrackers
going
off.
he
arrived.
he
saw
the
three
police
officers
still
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs
on
the
ground.
one
--
two
were
quiet,
one
was
making
the
rather
peculiar
rasping
noise.
truett
testified
that
he
then
saw
williams
bend
over
and
shoot
the
officer
making
the
noise
two
or
three
times
more
while
evans,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
here
the
appellee,
held
a
flashlight
for
him.
after
this
was
done,
the
three
car
thieves
turned
murderers
sped
off
into
the
night.
now,
truett’s
testimony
was
corroborated
by
an
abundance
of
physical
evidence
such
as
location
of
the
automobile,
the
location
of
the
pistols
which
were
later
found
as
well
as
a
testimony
of
various
other
witnesses.
as
i
stated
earlier,
none
of
the
testimony
which
i
have
related
to
this
point
is
it
all
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
testimony
which
is
an
issue
is
a
testimony
given
by
one
of
the
corroborating
witnesses.
this
testimony
is
a
testimony
given
by
one
lynwood
shaw.
shaw
was
fellow
inmate
in
the
federal
penitentiary
some
approximately
year
after
the
crime
at
the
time
venson
eugene
williams
was
arraigned
in
connection
with
the
triple
slaying.
on
the
day
following
his
arraignment
when
he
was
back
in
the
federal
prison,
his
fellow
inmate
shaw
asked
williams,
“how
did
you
make
out?”
the
reply
was,
“if
it
hadn’t
been
for
that
dirty
sob
alex
evans,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
this
now.”
this
testimony
was
subjected
to
by
evans
during
his
trial
on
the
ground
that
violated
both
the
hearsay
rule
and
his
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
trial
court
admitted
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
there
had
clearly
been
of
showing
of
a
car
theft
conspiracy
and
that
the
statement
had
been
made
during
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy,
therefore,
being
admissible
under
georgia
statutory
exception
to
the
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
solely
is
corroborating
the
testimony.
there
was
an
eyewitness
under
georgia
law
testimony
of
an
accomplice
must
be
corroborated
by
other
evidence.
there
were
several
witnesses
which
were
corroborating
witnesses.
one,
with
m.c.
perry,
i
couldn’t
name
the
others
or
several.
this
was
one
corroborating
witness.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
don’t
there’s
any
questions
to
that.
in
fact
it
was
much
weaker
corroborating
testimony
than
the
testimony
of
one
m.c.
perry
as
an
example.
yes,
it
was
merely
cumulative,
corroborating
testimony.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
perry
testified
the
he
had
been
conversing
with
both
evans
and
williams
about
stealing
an
oldsmobile
right
before
the
oldsmobile
was
stolen.
he
testified
that
actually
they
almost
went
in
with
them,
but
he
didn’t
mainly
because
they
had
it
at
overprice
what
he
would
get
for
helping
them.
he
also
testified
that
shortly
after
the
crime
in
a
conversation
with
evans
he
indicated
to
evans
that
i
think
along
the
line
i
can’t
quote
it
exactly
of
course,
but
he
talked
to
evans
indicating
that
he
had
some
idea
of
who
was
responsible
for
the
murders
which
of
course
had
hit
the
newspapers
by
that
time.
evans
grabbed
him,
punched
him
in
the
chest
and
in
effect
told
them
he
thought
he
knew
anything
he
better
keep
quiet
about
it
and
this
is
of
course
in
addition
to
the
physical
evidence
as
to
the
crime
itself
which
of
course
did
not
directly
tie
evidence
to
the
crime.
we
would
have
to
concede
that.
it
did
tend
to
verify
truett’s
testimony
generally
the
location
of
the
pistols.
truett
testified
that
pistols
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
window
of
the
car
as
they
sped
along
toward
the
expressway.
this
is
where
the
pistols
were
found.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
this
evidence
in
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
produced
in
this
case.
we
think
that
this
particular
testimony
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
could
not
have
possibly
affected
the
verdict.
that
is
our
view.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
am
not
certain,
sir.
i
have
to
answer
that
way.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
most
definitely,
sir.
in
any
event,
evans
appealed
this
ruling
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed
under
the
longstanding
georgia
rule
that
the
pendency
of
a
conspiracy
encompasses
the
period
of
concealment
after
the
accomplishment
of
the
unlawful
objective.
although,
i
point
out
here
that
we
say
unlawful
objective
the
conspiracy
we
know
extended
beyond
the
actual
time
of
the
murder
because
there
is
testimony
that
cars
were
stolen
after
the
time
the
murder
have
been
completed.
evans
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
was
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court,
yes
sir.
evans
appealed
this
point
after
losing
the
georgia
supreme
court.
he
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
i
did
not
say
that
georgia
supreme
court,
i
do
not
believe
consider
the
harmless
error
issue
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
consider
it
error
in
the
first
place.
they
thought
that
the
majority
thought
it
was
properly
admitted.
so
therefore,
obviously
they
did
not
treat
on
harmless
error
because
they
thought
there
was
no
error
at
all,
harmless
or
otherwise.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
retrospect,
i
would
certainly
agree.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
any
event,
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
unsuccessful
in
his
direct
appeals,
evans
next
turn
to
the
united
states
district
court
where
he
continued
what
has
lamentably
become
an
integral
part
of
the
appellate
process.
in
other
words,
he
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
the
writ.
it
sided
with
more
to
the
effect
that
the
evidentiary
rule
in
constitutional
standard
are
not
the
same
and
that
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
go
to
the
scope
of
testimony
which
can
be
given
by
a
witness
who
is
on
the
stand
and
available
for
a
cross-examination.
upon
appeal
however,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
took
a
different
view.
unlike
wigmore,
unlike
the
district
court
and
we
respectfully
submit
unlike
both
of
the
prior
and
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
equated
hearsay
with
the
confrontation
clause.
i
should
say,
it
acquitted
the
exclusionary
aspects
of
the
hearsay
rule
with
the
confrontation
clause.
now,
i
emphasize
this
point
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
stop
where
the
customary
exceptions
and
of
course
they
are
numerous
exceptions
to
the
rule
begin.
to
the
contrary
it
said,
first,
that
all
state
exceptions
to
the
rule
must
be
continually
scrutinized
and
reevaluated
by
federal
courts.
and
second,
they
said
that
state
exceptions
to
the
rule
would
be
permitted
only
where
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
admission
of
the
evidence
was
supported
by
“salient
and
cogent
reasons”
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
were
not
such
as
to
render
the
admission
salient
and
cogent.
the
court
held
that
as
applied,
georgia’s
hearsay,
statutory
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
it
violated
evans’
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause.
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
four
reasons
why
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
reversed.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
equating
the
evidentiary
rule
with
the
constitutional
standard.
under
the
traditional
or
wigmore
view,
which
we
urge
to
be
the
appropriate
view,
there
is
an
important
difference
between
the
two.
under
wigmore,
the
hearsay
rule
deals
with
the
competency
of
evidence.
under
whatever
existing
rules
of
evidence
are
then
in
effect,
the
confrontation
clause
according
to
wigmore
deals
with
the
procedure
by
which
testimony
is
presented
to
the
jury
and
that
is
that
it
must
be
presented
by
live
witnesses
who
are
available
for
cross-exam
and
not
by
ex
parte
affidavits
or
the
depositions.
unlike
a
live
witness,
a
piece
of
paper
cannot
be
cross-examined.
in
maddox
versus
united
states,
this
court
cited
with
approval
a
great
number
of
decisions
of
state
courts
such
as
simmons
versus
ohio
which
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
intended
to
effect
the
nature
or
scope
of
testimony
given
by
a
witness
who
was
on
the
stand
and
available
for
cross-examination.
since,
i
last
argued
this
case
of
course
this
court
decided
california
versus
green
which
we
think
goes
a
considerable
way
toward
upholding
our
position
on
this
threshold
error
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
decision
appeared
to
reaffirm
the
statement
in
stein
versus
new
york
that
the
hearsay
rule
was
not
to
be
read
in
to
the
constitution.
surely,
it
is
a
rule
which
is
singularly
undeserving
of
constitutional
status.
the
hearsay
rule
is
unknown
in
most
every
civilized
system
of
jurisprudence.
the
continental
lawyer
throws
up
his
hands
and
wonders
when
you
try
to
explain
it
to
him.
within
the
systems
which
do
have
the
hearsay
rule,
it
is
--
i
would
say
universally
criticized
by
the
writers,
the
law
review
articles.
you
find
as
a
rare
person
that
has
much
good
to
say
about
the
hearsay
rule.
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
the
reformers
all
--
virtually
all
of
whom
are
either
for
a
total
obligation
or
drastic
revision
must
now
fight
the
constitution
as
well
as
too
many
years
of
inertia.
we
urge
the
court
to
reiterate
and
affirm
that
hearsay
rule
is
not
the
same
as
the
confrontation
clause.
moving
beyond
this
threshold
error,
we
would
say
that
perhaps
the
greatest
potential
for
mischief
in
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
is
the
wholly
subjective
test
it
device
for
federal
judges
to
second
guess
state
judges.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
no
matter
how
settled
the
state
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
might
be.
the
application
of
a
state
evidentiary
rule
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
by
a
state
judge
is
now
to
be
subject
to
reversal
if
a
reviewing
federal
judge
perhaps
many
years
later
feels
that
as
he
sees
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
reasons
for
admission
were
not
sufficiently
to
cite
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
salient
or
cogent.
now,
of
course
this
is
no
guide
at
all
for
the
state
trial
judge
who
must
make
a
decision
during
trial.
he
can’t
obviously
to
have
a
recess
and
phone
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
federal
court
of
appeals
or
a
district
court
judge
to
get
agreement
as
to
whether
the
reasons
are
salient
or
cogent.
we
hope
the
court
will
reverse
the
circuit
court
on
the
grounds
of
the
threshold
error.
however,
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
this,
if
hearsay
to
some
extent
or
other
is
to
be
equated
with
the
confrontation
clause,
we
sincerely
hold
that
this
court
will
come
up
with
some
intelligible
objective
standards
so
that
a
state
trial
judge
will
have
some
idea
of
what
to
do
when
the
hearsay
question
comes
up
during
the
trial
of
the
criminal
case.
now,
of
course
if
we
are
incorrect
in
our
view
that
the
hearsay
rule
and
confrontation
clause
are
different
or
for
that
matter,
if
the
overlap
is
substantial
and
if
the
overlap
does
affect
the
scope
of
testimony
as
well
as
the
use
of
ex
parte
affidavits
or
depositions.
we
must
then
deal
with
the
question
of
the
status
of
both
long
recognized
and
for
that
matter
any
new
state
exceptions
to
the
rule.
one
such
exception
of
longstanding
is
the
exception
under
which
the
evidence
here
was
admitted
--
the
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
in
georgia
as
elsewhere,
the
declaration
of
one
conspirator
subject
to
certain
restrictions
is
admissible
against
other
conspirators.
one
general
can
restriction
is
that
the
statement
must
be
made
during
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
but
at
last
there
is
great
disagreement
as
to
what
the
pendency
is.
in
georgia,
as
in
many
and
i'm
not
sure
perhaps
most
states,
the
conspiracy
is
viewed
as
continuing
into
the
period
of
concealment
after
the
primary
unlawful
act
or
objective
has
been
accomplished.
this
view
is
supported
by
wharton’s
criminal
evidence
and
is
based
on
what
i
think
is
rather
a
common
sense
approach
that
a
conspirator
has
in
his
mind
or
he
has
an
interest
i
should
say
in
accomplishing
all
objectives
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
can
one
say
that
the
avoidance
of
detection
is
any
less
an
objective
than
committing
the
crime
on
the
first
instance?
i
think
not.
we
recognized
of
course
that
the
federal
view
difference
in
cases
as
krulewitch,
this
court
has
held
that
in
potential
criminal
proceedings
the
conspiracy
terminates
upon
completion
of
the
last
overt
act
in
its
furtherance.
but
krulewitch
clearly
shows
that
this
is
but
the
supervision
of
this
court
over
the
evidentiary
rules
in
federal
criminal
proceedings.
in
fact,
krulewitch
referred
to
georgia
and
other
states
which
have
a
different
view.
it
did
not
hint
that
there
was
anything
unconstitutional
about
georgia
or
the
other
states
adhering
to
this
view.
in
any
event,
we
find
it
hard
to
think
of
any
reason
why
this
difference
of
view
should
be
a
constitutional
issue.
surely,
it
has
no
bearing
upon
the
trustworthiness
justification
which
is
ordinarily
used
in
support
of
the
rules
exceptions.
we
think
that
statement
in
question
clearly
bears
all
the
earmarks
of
being
trustworthy.
to
start
with,
it
was
not
a
long
narrative
statement
where
the
error
or
the
danger
of
error
in
the
retailing
would
be
great.
it
was
a
spontaneous
and
a
simple
spontaneous
exclamation
really
in
the
nature
of
ouch
to
a
specific
question
which
the
declarant
--
excuse
me
in
answer
to
a
question
post
to
the
declarant.
i
assumed
there
would
have
been
no
objection
at
all
if
the
witness
had
testified
as
to
the
physical
reaction
to
his
question
such
as,
anger,
tears
or
flash
face.
what
logical
reason
can
there
be
for
distinguishing
between
the
auditory
and
visual
perceptions
of
the
witness
who
was
on
the
stand
of
the
course.
moreover,
the
statement
to
the
extent
that
it
has
any
significance
at
all
is
obviously
a
declaration
against
interest.
most
use
--
most
normally
declarations
against
interests
are
not
made
unless
they
are
true.
if
measured
by
the
trustworthiness
criterion,
we
think
that
this
spontaneous
exclamation
against
interest
is
at
least
as
trustworthy
as
the
dying
declaration
exception
about
which
apparently
no
one
disagrees.
we
think
it
is
far
more
trustworthy
than
reputation
evidence
which
is
admissible
on
criminal
cases
and
as
the
court
is
aware,
reputation
evidence
not
only
can
be
hearsay,
it
must
be
hearsay
and
can
be
nothing
but
hearsay.
we
think
the
georgia’s
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
rule
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case
is
reasonable,
serves
a
valid
purpose
of
shedding
more
rather
than
less
light
on
the
question
at
issue
and
ought
not
to
be
held
unconstitutional
whether
or
not
the
hearsay
rule
in
confrontation
clause
are
to
be
equated.
coming
then
to
harmless
error,
we
think
that
even
if
the
admission
of
the
declaration
should
against
our
contentions
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
we
think
that
it
could
not
conceivably
have
influenced
the
verdict
or
prejudice
the
accused
in
anyway.
it
was
a
testimony
of
wade
truett
which
convicted
evans.
shaw’s
testimony
was
a
wholly
corroborative
and
even
as
corroborative
evidence,
it
was
really
so
constraint
compared
with
the
corroborative
evidence
of
witnesses
such
as
m.c.
perry.
this
court
has
held
that
where
the
erroneous
submission
is
merely
cumulative
and
will
not
affect
the
result,
the
error
is
harmless.
we
think
that
harrington
versus
california
ought
to
control
it
on
this
point.
i
should
like
to
save
my
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
should
like
to
save
my
remaining
time.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
hearsay
rule
is
to
be
read
into
and
equated
with
this
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
factual
setting
in
which
the
setting
arose
was
petitioner
evans’
trial
for
murder
in
connection
with
the
slaying
of
three
police
officers
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
the
principal
witness
for
the
state
was
wade
truett,
an
accomplice
who
turns
state
evidence.
truett
has
testified
as
an
eyewitness
to
all
material
details
of
the
triple
slaying.
truett’s
testimony
is
not
here
in
question
and
i
will
not
go
into
it
in
great
detail.
however,
i
do
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to
touch
upon
the
highlights
of
his
testimony.
after
relating
the
essential
elements
of
a
car
theft
conspiracy,
truett
testified
how
long
with
the
petitioner
evans
and
one
venson
eugene
williams,
they
stole
a
car
in
atlanta,
georgia.
the
stolen
car
was
driven
to
a
rural
location
in
nearby
gwinnett
county
where
they
decided
they
would
change
the
license
place--
plates
and
the
ignition
switch.
while
in
the
process
of
changing
the
plates
and
the
switch,
they
were
apprehended
by
the
three
soon-to-die
police
officers.
unfortunately,
the
youngest
officer,
while
bending
over
the
front
seat
of
the
car
to
examine
the
ignition
switch,
put
himself
in
such
a
position
as
to
enable
evans
to
remove
his
revolver.
evans
ordered
all
three
officers
to
raise
their
hands.
they
were
then
disarmed
and
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs.
at
this
point,
truett
took
the
police
car
and
drove
it
off
into
the
woods
for
concealment.
as
he
was
returning
to
the
spot
where
evans
and
williams
were
with
the
three
police
officers,
he
heard
what
sounded
to
him
to
be--
he
described
it
as
a
nickel
pack
of
firecrackers
going
off.
upon
his
arrival,
he
saw
the
police
officers
on
the
ground
still
handcuffed
together.
one
police
officer
was
making
a
peculiar
sound.
he
then
saw
williams
bend
over
and
fire
two
or
three
more
times
into
the
police
officer
while
evans
held
the
flashlight.
truett’s
testimony
was
corroborated
by
physical
evidence
as
well
as
the
evidence
of
other
witnesses.
it
is
a
testimony
of
one
of
the
corroborating
witnesses
which
gives
rise
to
the
questions
which
are
presented
to
the
court
today.
the
witness
in
question
is
linwood
shaw.
shaw
was
a
fellow
inmate
of
venson
eugene
williams
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
the
time
williams
was
arraigned
for
the
murder.
on
the
day
following
his
arraignment,
shaw
asked
williams
how
he
made
out.
the
rather
spontaneous
exclamation
reply
was
“if
it
hadn’t
been
for
that
dirty
sob
alex
evans,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
this
now.”
the
testimony
was
admitted
over
objection.
the
trial
court
based
its
ruling
upon
the
fact
that
the
state,
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court,
had
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
an
auto
theft
conspiracy
and
the
statement
was
therefore
admissible
under
the
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
for
co-conspirators,
an
exception
which
is
provided
by
statute
in
georgia.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
georgia,
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this,
it
is
a
matter
of
right
that
the
accused
can
have
a
separate
trial.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
they
were
tried
separately.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
truett
was
not
tried.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
turned
state
evidence
and
there
was
a
grant
of
immunity.
there
was
full
disclosure
of
that
fact
to
the
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
exception
was
that
the
state
had
shown
a
prima
facie
conspiracy
to
steal
automobiles.
the
rule
in
georgia,
as
i
think
in
virtually
all
other
states
and
in
the
federal
system,
is
that
the
statement
of
a
co-conspirator
is
admissible
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
it
was
admitted
on
this
basis,
that
it
was
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
is
one
printed
error
in
that.
it
should
read
“upon
the
showing
of
the
fact.”
i
think
in
the
printing
of
it,
it
came
out
“facts.”
it
should
be
singular
of
course.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
is,
of
course--
i--
this
is
a
distinction
between
what
i
believe
is
a
majority
rule
in
the
states
and
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts.
this
court,
in
cases
such
as
krulewitch,
decided
that
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
is
at
an
end
upon
the
last
overt
act.
in
krulewitch,
this
court
expressly
noted
that
the
view
was
to
the
contrary
in
many
states,
including
georgia.
the
court
noted
that
georgia’s
rule
was
different.
there
was
no
criticism
of
the
georgia
rule
and
the
court
clearly,
as
i
see
it,
indicated
that
it
was
ruling
on
a
rule
of
evidence
to
be
applied
in
federal
courts
and
not
a
constitution
standard.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
no,
sir.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
new
code
on--
of
the
federal
committee
has
to
say.
i
know
the
trend
in
most
of
the
model
codes
has
been
to
either
terminate,
abrogate,
or
greatly
restrict
the
present
hearsay
rule.
the
trend
has
been
against
the
exclusion
of
hearsay.
that
has
been
the
trend
in
most
model
codes.
in
any
event,
this
evidence
was
admitted.
petitioner
evans
was
convicted.
he
raised
the
issue,
among
others,
in
his
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
having
exhausted
his
direct
appeals,
petitioner
evans
turned
to
the
united
states
district
court
where
he
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
the
writ,
citing
wigmore
to
the
effect
that
the
evidentiary
rule
and
the
constitutional
standard
are
not
the
same,
and
that
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
describe
what
kinds
of
testimonial
statements
may
be
given
by
a
witness
who
is
on
the
stand
and
is
available
for
cross-examination.
upon
appeal,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
the
matter.
unlike
wigmore,
unlike
the
district
court,
and
i
think
unlike
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
constitutional
standard
as
one
which
incorporates
the
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence
known
as
hearsay,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
stop
where
the
generally
recognized
exceptions
to
the
rule
begin.
to
the
contrary,
it
said
that,
in
the
future,
all
stated--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
there’s
a
very
interesting
footnote
in
bruton.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bruton,
of
course
the--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
statement
of
a
co-defendant
and
it
was
a
confession,
if
you
will,
of
a
co-defendant
in
a
trial
which
we
think
is
a
situation
quite
different
from
this.
and,
bruton
expressly
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
to
the
decision,
i
think
a
very
important
footnote,
it
stated
that
the
evidence
there
in
question
was
not
admissible
under
any
recognized
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
and,
in
bruton,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
did
not
mean
to
imply
in
any
manner
whatsoever
that
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
necessarily
raise
problems
under
the
confrontation
clause.
in
so
doing,
it
cited
wigmore,
the
particular
section
on
which
we
rely
in
wigmore,
and
it
also
cited
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
in
mattox
in
which
we
also
rely.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
probably
some
overlap.
in
this
court,
it
is
a
difficult
task,
but
i
think
the
task
for
this
court
is
to
delineate
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause.
of
course,
this
was
somewhat
an
academic
matter
prior
to
pointer
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
first
applied
to
the
states.
until
that
time,
it
really
didn’t
matter
too
much
to
the
federal
criminal
defendant
whether
his
reversal
was
based
upon
a
procedural
rule
of
hearsay
or
the
confrontation
clause.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that,
hence,
for
all
state
exceptions
would
have
to
continually
scrutinized
and
re-evaluated
and
that
the
state
exceptions
would
be
permitted
only
where
supported
by
salient
and
cogent
reasons.
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
in
the
case
at
bar
were
not
sufficiently
salient
or
cogent,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
saying
that
the
georgia
statutory
exception,
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
as
applied
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
at
bar,
violated
evans’
confrontation
rights.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
four
reasons
why
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
ought
to
be
reversed.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
elevated
that
ancient
and
much
maligned
exclusionary
rule,
known
as
the
hearsay
rule,
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
mandate.
the
view
stated
by
wigmore,
which
we
think
to
be
the
correct
view
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
the
constitution,
does
not
deal
with
the
questions
of
what
kinds
of
testimonial
statements
must
be
given
infra-judicially,
this
being
dependent
upon
the
law
of
evidence
for
the
time
being,
but
only
upon
what
procedure
shall
be
followed,
which
is
of
course
a
cross-examining
procedure
by
the
old--
which,
as
to
that
testimony
which
is
required
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
to
be
given
infra-judicially.
this
appears
to
be
the
view
which
this
court
followed
in
mattox
versus
united
states
where
it
pointed
out
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
designed
primarily
to
exclude
ex
parte
affidavits
and
depositions,
but
not
to
go
to
the
competency
of
testimony
of
a
witness
who
does
appear
in
court
and
is
available
for
cross-examination.
i’ve
already
pointed
out
that,
in
bruton,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
evidence
there
in
question
was
not
recognized
by
any
exception
to
the
rule
and
that
it--
the
court
intimated
no
view
whatever
that
hearsay
exceptions
necessarily
raise
questions
under
the
confrontation
clause,
and
it
cited
a
particular
provision
of
wigmore
to
which
i
refer
and
also
to
the
mattox
decision
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
we
urge
the
court
not
to
read
the
hearsay
rule
with
or
without
exceptions
into
the
confrontation
clause.
we
think
it
is
a
rule
singularly
undeserving
of
the
honor.
it
is
unknown--
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
in
any
system
of
jurisprudence
other
than
the
annual
jackson
system,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
has
been
roundly
criticized
by
every
scholar
of
our
system.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
i
think
that--
as
i
re--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
bruton
applies.
in
the
first
place,
wigmore
and
the
other
authorities
usually
distinguish
between
a
confession
which
is
an
admission
as
to
every
material
element
of
the
crime
and
other
admissions
and,
particularly,
of
course
you
have
the
situation
in
bruton
where
the
confession
was
to
police
authorities.
i
think
it
was
a
postal
authority
in
bruton,
as
i
recall
it.
now,
we
think
that
the
situation
respecting
the
confession,
particularly
a
confession
to
public
authorities
is
quite
different
from
an
admission--
actually,
i
don’t
know
how
much
an
admission
this
statement
was.
to
me,
it’s
a
rather
cryptic
statement
but,
presumably,
an
admission
against
penal
interest
at
best.
we
think
the
situation
is
quite
different.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don’t
think
bruton
would
have
applied
because,
as
i
read
bruton,
it
applies
to
confessions
and
particularly
confessions
to
police
officers.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
would
possibly
apply
if
the
confession
had
been
made
to
police
officers.
i
think
the
distinction
is
this,
mr.
justice
brennan.
a
confession
made
to
police
officers
obviously
cannot
be
consistent
with
the
conspiracy.
it
is
a
negation
of
a
conspiracy.
it
ends
the
conspiracy.
i
don’t
think
this
is
necessarily
the
same
as
a
confession
to
a
fellow
inmate
in
a
prison,
who,
one
might
assume,
would
not,
as
it
were,
spill
the
beans.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
situations
plus
the
fact
that,
here,
this
statement,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
could
be
considered
full
confession.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course,
this
issue
has
never
been
decided.
i
personally
would
urge
that
rule.
yes,
sir,
because
i
would
urge
that
comes
in
the
co-conspirator
exception
if
it’s
made
to
a
prisoner
during
the
concealment
period
when
the
conspiracy
is
still
in
effect.
in
other
words,
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
bruton--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
bruton--
as
i
read
bruton,
it
addressed
itself--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
confession
were
made,
i
would
say,
during
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
and
if
it
were
made
to
a
person
other
than
a
public
authority,
such
as--
i
think
you’d
have
to--
you’d
have
to
get
into
the
facts
of
the
particular
situation,
but
i
think
it
would
be
possible
that
it
would
be
admissible
under
bruton.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
basis
of
the
distinction
would
be
that,
in
a
conspiracy
situation,
it
is
consistent
with
continuation
of
the
conspiracy
to
have
a
statement
made
to
another
individual.
it
is
consistent
with
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy.
however,
if
it’s
made--
if
there
is
a
confession
to
a
police
officer,
i
think
that
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
continuance
of
a
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
ordinarily,
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
other
way.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
the
traditional
view
has
been
along
an
agency
theory
that
when
people
are
acting
together
to
accomplish
an
illegal
purpose
that
the
acts
and
statements
of
one
party
are
admissible
in
evidence
against
all
other
parties
because
they’re
working
together
as
agents,
and
of
course
the
law
has
always
taken
a
view
that
there
is
something
more
inherently
evil
about
a
combination
to
commit
crime
than
the
perpetration
by
a
single
individual.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it’s
a
rule
of
evidence.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
this
particular
state
and
i
think--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
in
this
particular
statement,
to
go
into
the
question
of
trustworthiness
which,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
usual
justifications
for
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
i
think
that
this
statement
is
probably
trustworthy
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
a
long
narrative
in
which
the
danger
of
error
in
the
retelling
would
be
very
great.
it’s
a
specific
response
to
a
very
specific
question.
now,
if
the
witness
had
testified
as
to
a
physical
impression
such
as
anger,
flushed
face,
i
think
no
one
would
question
that
that
would
be
admissible.
is
there
any
good
reason
for
discriminating
against
auditory
perceptions
in
favor
of
a
visual
perception
when
the
statement
is
so
brief,
so
short?
i
think
not.
secondly,
it
is
a
statement
which
is
against
the
penal
interest
of
the
declarant.
this
is
a
statement
which
ordinarily
would
not
be
made,
i
think,
unless
true.
finally,
when
you
compare
it
to
the
other
recognized
exceptions--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i’m
saying
that--
i’m
saying
why
this
particular
statement
in
the
case
at
hand
i
think
is
trustworthy,
for
what
it’s
worth.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
really
cannot
answer
that.
that
was
not
the
grounds
urged
by
counsel
and,
therefore,
i
can’t
answer
what
the
rule--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
my
argument
goes
in
that
direction
for
purposes
of
demonstrating,
i
hope,
to
the
court
that
the
statement
was
trustworthy,
only
for
a
demonstration.
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
exceptions
such
as
dying
declaration.
i
would
think
the
statement
like
this
is
at
least
trustworthy
as
a
dying
declaration.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
sir,
if
there
is
an
error
in
hearsay,
i
do--
i
agree.
i
do
not
think
it
necessarily
reaches
a
problem
with
constitutional
dimensions
if
there’s
an
error
in
the
admission
of
hearsay.
of
course,
it
is
always
true
in
hearsay
that
hearsay
per
se
relates
to
the
declara--
to
an
out-of-court
declaration.
so,
to
that
extent,
anytime
there’s
any
hearsay.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
trustworthiness--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
trustworthiness
and
also
the
general
feeling
that,
after
all,
the
purpose
of
evidence
is
to
shed
light
and
many
judges
have
written
that
they
feel
that
the
suppression
of
hearsay,
more
often
than
not,
keeps
light
off
the
matter
under
investigation
and
that
it
causes
more
damages
than
good.
in
any
event,
the
test
has
been
roundly
criticized
by
all
legal
scholars
and
we
feel
that
it
would
be
a
pity
if
the
reformers
have
to
fight
the
constitutional
standard
as
well
as
what
we
think
is
far
too
many
hearings
of
inertia.
now,
while
we
think
the
primary
legal
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
its
equating
of
the
evidentiary
rule
and
constitutional
standard,
we
feel
that
the
far
greater
mischief
potential
in
its
decision
was
the
test
it
set
forth
for
review
by
federal
judges
of
the
application
state
exceptions.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
no
matter
how
settled
a
state
exception
might
be,
its
application
by
a
state
judge
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
is
subject
to
reversal
by
a
reviewing
federal
judge
if
the
federal
judge
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
in
the
particular
case
for
the
adherence
to
state
law
were
not
sufficiently
salient
or
cogent.
in
reality,
this
is
just
a
pure
second
guessing
test.
the
entirely
subjective
nature
of
this
test,
we
think,
contribute
only
further
to
the
lamentable
trend
for
state
criminal
proceedings
to
be
conducted
as
ping
pong
matches
between
state
and
federal
tribunals.
we
hope,
first
and
foremost,
that
this
court
will
decline
to
elevate
the
hearsay
rule
to
a
constitutional
standard.
but,
should
the
court
disagree,
we
hope
at
the
very
minimum
that
the
court
will
provide
some
intelligible
object
of
standards
so
that
trial
judges--
state
trial
judges
may
have
some
idea
as
to
how
to
conduct
criminal
trials
when
the
question
of
hearsay
arises.
we
think
this
much
is
necessary
to
the
orderly
disposition
of
state
criminal
trials.
now,
i’ve
already
dealt
very
briefly
with
the
distinction
between--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course,
pointer--
the
decision
of
pointer
versus
texas
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
wigmore
rule.
the
wigmore
rule
is
that
confrontation
relates
to
the
procedure,
by
which
evidence
is
placed
before
a
jury.
pointer
involved
a
transcript.
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
hearsay--
excuse
me,
of
the
confrontation
standard
is
to
prevent
trials
upon
depositions
and
ex
parte
affidavits.
i
recognize
that
even
to
this
rule,
the
confrontation
rule,
there
are
exceptions,
but
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
not
going
to
the
question
of
the
competency
of
this
testimony.
that
is
the
traditional,
what
i
call,
the
wigmore
rule
which
i
think
is
a
traditional
rule
which
this
court
has
followed
in
past
decisions.
in
stine
versus
new
york
and
said
it
would
not
read
the
hearsay
rule
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
of
course
the
problem
if
we
are
wrong,
if
this
court
decides
that
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
confrontation
clause
are
to
be
equated,
you
then
reach,
i
think,
the
exceedingly
difficult
problem
of
how
to
treat
long
standing
state
exceptions
to
the
rule,
particularly
this
problem
is
acute
where
the
state
and
the
federal
rule
vary.
this
is
a
situation
with
respect
to
the
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
hearsay
clause.
i’ve
already
mentioned
that
in
krulewitch.
this
court
took
the
view
that
the
conspiracy
ends
upon
completion
of
the
last
overt
act
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
until
one
year
ago,
there
was
no
general
crime
of
conspiracy
in
georgia.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
an
evidentiary
rule,
no
question
about
that.
finally,
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
has
been
constitutional
error
we
think,
in
this
case
it
is,
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt,
harmless
error.
this
man
was
convicted
upon
the
testimony
of
wade
truett,
an
eyewitness.
the
record
shows
ample
corroboration
both
by
physical
evidence
and
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses.
we
think
that
even
under
chapman,
the
ruling
of
chapman
that
the
error
here,
if
error
existed,
was
harmless
error
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
like
to
save
what
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
comment
only
on
two
matters.
first,
dealing
with
the
last
question,
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
that
if
the
case
should
be
remanded,
witherspoon
would
be
applied
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
be
a
death
penalty.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
held
in
the
case,
this
has
already
been
held
in
the
williams
case
and
we
would
concede
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
commutation
of
the
penalty
to
life
in
prison,
yes,
sir.
secondly,
i
would
just
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
furtherance--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
because
the--
in
the
williams
case,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
the
application
of
witherspoon.
in
this
case,
they
held
a
new
trial
was
required
because
of
a
denial
of
confrontation
and
said,
therefore,
they
did
not
reach
witherspoon.
however,
they
suggested
upon
retrial
that
the
court
consider
these
problems.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
this
will
be
required.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
i
suppose--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
right,
it
will
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
but
it
will
be
commuted.
there’s
no
question.
it
will
be
commuted.
the
other--
my
only
other
comment
has
to
do
with
the
furtherance
rule.
there
are
many
variants
of
furtherance
in
the
various
states.
the
georgia
view
is--
they
interpret
it.
they
don’t
use
the
word
“furtherance.”
they
say
“relevancy.”
in
our
brief,
we
cite
a
federal
court
which
interpreted
“furtherance”
exactly
the
same
way.
i
think
that
it
is
not
the
rule
anywhere
that
i
know
of
that
the
actual
statement
itself
must
further
conspiracy.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
that
it
relates
to
acts
taking
place
during
a
conspiracy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
black,
there
were
many
errors
alleged
in
the--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course
if
the
new
trial
is
granted,
yes,
this
is
so.
if
the
new
trial
is
granted
then,
of
course,
you
would
have
a
new
jury
and,
in
that
case,
the
wither--
there
might--
could
be
a
death
penalty
if
the
new
trial
is
granted.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i’m
assuming
that,
on
remand,
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
under
this
trial,
the
trial
which
we
have
had,
witherspoon
is
applicable.
of
course,
if
there
is
a
new
trial,
presumably,
the
district
attorney
would
examine
the
witness
in
such
a
way
as
to
comport
to
witherspoon.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
problems
which
stand
from
the
relationship
between
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
issues
arose
during
the
trial
of
the
--
here
appellee,
alex
evans
for
murder
in
connection
with
slaying
of
three
police
officers
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
evans
was
convicted
primarily
by
the
testimony
of
one
wade
truett,
an
accomplice
who
turned
state’s
evidence.
truett
was
an
eyewitness
to
all
the
material
details
of
the
client
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
murder
was
on
the
evening
about
april
17,
1964.
the
trial
was
approximately
a
little
over
a
year
later
in
october
1965.
in
any
event
as
i
was
saying
truett
testified
as
to
all
material
details
of
the
triple
slaying.
truett’s
testimony
is
not
here
in
question
and
shan’t
go
into
it
in
great
detail.
however,
i
do
think
it
might
be
appropriate
to
summarize
a
few
of
the
highlights
so
as
to
put
the
issues
which
i
will
come
to
discuss
in
their
proper
factual
context.
according
to
truett,
he,
evans,
and
venson
eugene
williams
have
been
engaged
in
a
plan
in
concert
of
action
to
steal
automobiles.
the
basic
nature
of
the
plan
was
as
follows:
they
would
first
purchase
a
vehicle
which
had
been
wrecked
beyond
the
point
where
it
could
be
commercially
repaired.
by
this,
i
mean
to
commercially
repair
a
wrecked
vehicle
entails
the
purchase
of
spare
automotive
parts.
they
would
first
purchase
a
vehicle
which
was
so
badly
repaired
that
the
purchase
of
the
automotive
parts
would
cost
more
and
they
could
recover
on
the
subsequent
resale
of
the
vehicle.
that
was
the
first
step
of
their
operation.
the
second
step
was
to
steal
an
identical
vehicle.
by
doing
this,
they
could
pirate
the
required
parts
from
the
stolen
vehicle,
put
them
on
direct
vehicle
and
sell
it
at
very
a
substantial
profit.
in
addition,
they
could
use
the
spare
parts
of
the
stolen
vehicle
for
resale
and
make
a
profit
on
these
parts
as
well.
in
pursuing
this
plan,
it’s
important
to
note
that
cars
were
stolen
before
at
the
time
of
and
after
the
slaying
of
the
three
police
officers.
the
slaying
itself
grew
out
of
the
theft
of
an
automobile.
the
car
in
question
was
an
oldsmobile.
it
was
stolen
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
april
17,
1964
following
their
ordinary
course
of
operations;
they
drove
the
automobile
to
a
rural
location
in
nearby
gwinnett
county,
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
as
quickly
as
possible
changing
the
ignition
and
also
the
license
plates
on
the
car.
while
they
were
doing
this,
a
person
in
the
vicinity
saw
the
lights
and
it
was
a
little
bit
unusual
in
this
particular
area
of
gwinnett
county,
so
he
called
the
police.
the
police
dispatched
three
officers
in
a
car
to
investigate.
the
police
officers
arrived
and
apprehended
the
three
criminals.
then
unfortunately,
the
youngest
police
officer
made
a
bad
mistake
which
was
to
cause
him
and
the
two
other
officers
of
their
lives.
he
bent
over
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
to
examine
the
ignition
switch.
as
he
was
doing
this,
he
apparently
was
a
little
bit
careless
about
where
evans
was.
evans
was
standing
near
him
as
he
was
bending
over;
evans
managed
to
grab
his
revolver,
his
police
revolver.
he
ordered
all
of
the
officers
to
put
their
hands
up
which
they
did.
the
officers
were
promptly
disarmed
and
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs.
at
this
point,
either
evans
or
williams
told
truett
to
get
the
police
car
off
the
road.
truett
backed
the
police
car
off
the
road
into
a
field.
as
he
returned
to
where
the
officers
were,
he
heard
what
sound
to
him
like
a
pack
of
firecrackers
going
off.
he
arrived.
he
saw
the
three
police
officers
still
manacled
with
their
own
handcuffs
on
the
ground.
one
--
two
were
quiet,
one
was
making
the
rather
peculiar
rasping
noise.
truett
testified
that
he
then
saw
williams
bend
over
and
shoot
the
officer
making
the
noise
two
or
three
times
more
while
evans,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
here
the
appellee,
held
a
flashlight
for
him.
after
this
was
done,
the
three
car
thieves
turned
murderers
sped
off
into
the
night.
now,
truett’s
testimony
was
corroborated
by
an
abundance
of
physical
evidence
such
as
location
of
the
automobile,
the
location
of
the
pistols
which
were
later
found
as
well
as
a
testimony
of
various
other
witnesses.
as
i
stated
earlier,
none
of
the
testimony
which
i
have
related
to
this
point
is
it
all
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
testimony
which
is
an
issue
is
a
testimony
given
by
one
of
the
corroborating
witnesses.
this
testimony
is
a
testimony
given
by
one
lynwood
shaw.
shaw
was
fellow
inmate
in
the
federal
penitentiary
some
approximately
year
after
the
crime
at
the
time
venson
eugene
williams
was
arraigned
in
connection
with
the
triple
slaying.
on
the
day
following
his
arraignment
when
he
was
back
in
the
federal
prison,
his
fellow
inmate
shaw
asked
williams,
“how
did
you
make
out?”
the
reply
was,
“if
it
hadn’t
been
for
that
dirty
sob
alex
evans,
we
wouldn’t
be
in
this
now.”
this
testimony
was
subjected
to
by
evans
during
his
trial
on
the
ground
that
violated
both
the
hearsay
rule
and
his
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
trial
court
admitted
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
there
had
clearly
been
of
showing
of
a
car
theft
conspiracy
and
that
the
statement
had
been
made
during
the
continuance
of
the
conspiracy,
therefore,
being
admissible
under
georgia
statutory
exception
to
the
rule.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
solely
is
corroborating
the
testimony.
there
was
an
eyewitness
under
georgia
law
testimony
of
an
accomplice
must
be
corroborated
by
other
evidence.
there
were
several
witnesses
which
were
corroborating
witnesses.
one,
with
m.c.
perry,
i
couldn’t
name
the
others
or
several.
this
was
one
corroborating
witness.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
don’t
there’s
any
questions
to
that.
in
fact
it
was
much
weaker
corroborating
testimony
than
the
testimony
of
one
m.c.
perry
as
an
example.
yes,
it
was
merely
cumulative,
corroborating
testimony.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
perry
testified
the
he
had
been
conversing
with
both
evans
and
williams
about
stealing
an
oldsmobile
right
before
the
oldsmobile
was
stolen.
he
testified
that
actually
they
almost
went
in
with
them,
but
he
didn’t
mainly
because
they
had
it
at
overprice
what
he
would
get
for
helping
them.
he
also
testified
that
shortly
after
the
crime
in
a
conversation
with
evans
he
indicated
to
evans
that
i
think
along
the
line
i
can’t
quote
it
exactly
of
course,
but
he
talked
to
evans
indicating
that
he
had
some
idea
of
who
was
responsible
for
the
murders
which
of
course
had
hit
the
newspapers
by
that
time.
evans
grabbed
him,
punched
him
in
the
chest
and
in
effect
told
them
he
thought
he
knew
anything
he
better
keep
quiet
about
it
and
this
is
of
course
in
addition
to
the
physical
evidence
as
to
the
crime
itself
which
of
course
did
not
directly
tie
evidence
to
the
crime.
we
would
have
to
concede
that.
it
did
tend
to
verify
truett’s
testimony
generally
the
location
of
the
pistols.
truett
testified
that
pistols
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
window
of
the
car
as
they
sped
along
toward
the
expressway.
this
is
where
the
pistols
were
found.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
this
evidence
in
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
produced
in
this
case.
we
think
that
this
particular
testimony
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
could
not
have
possibly
affected
the
verdict.
that
is
our
view.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
am
not
certain,
sir.
i
have
to
answer
that
way.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
most
definitely,
sir.
in
any
event,
evans
appealed
this
ruling
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed
under
the
longstanding
georgia
rule
that
the
pendency
of
a
conspiracy
encompasses
the
period
of
concealment
after
the
accomplishment
of
the
unlawful
objective.
although,
i
point
out
here
that
we
say
unlawful
objective
the
conspiracy
we
know
extended
beyond
the
actual
time
of
the
murder
because
there
is
testimony
that
cars
were
stolen
after
the
time
the
murder
have
been
completed.
evans
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
was
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court,
yes
sir.
evans
appealed
this
point
after
losing
the
georgia
supreme
court.
he
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
i
did
not
say
that
georgia
supreme
court,
i
do
not
believe
consider
the
harmless
error
issue
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
consider
it
error
in
the
first
place.
they
thought
that
the
majority
thought
it
was
properly
admitted.
so
therefore,
obviously
they
did
not
treat
on
harmless
error
because
they
thought
there
was
no
error
at
all,
harmless
or
otherwise.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
retrospect,
i
would
certainly
agree.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
any
event,
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
unsuccessful
in
his
direct
appeals,
evans
next
turn
to
the
united
states
district
court
where
he
continued
what
has
lamentably
become
an
integral
part
of
the
appellate
process.
in
other
words,
he
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
denied
the
writ.
it
sided
with
more
to
the
effect
that
the
evidentiary
rule
in
constitutional
standard
are
not
the
same
and
that
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
go
to
the
scope
of
testimony
which
can
be
given
by
a
witness
who
is
on
the
stand
and
available
for
a
cross-examination.
upon
appeal
however,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
took
a
different
view.
unlike
wigmore,
unlike
the
district
court
and
we
respectfully
submit
unlike
both
of
the
prior
and
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
equated
hearsay
with
the
confrontation
clause.
i
should
say,
it
acquitted
the
exclusionary
aspects
of
the
hearsay
rule
with
the
confrontation
clause.
now,
i
emphasize
this
point
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
stop
where
the
customary
exceptions
and
of
course
they
are
numerous
exceptions
to
the
rule
begin.
to
the
contrary
it
said,
first,
that
all
state
exceptions
to
the
rule
must
be
continually
scrutinized
and
reevaluated
by
federal
courts.
and
second,
they
said
that
state
exceptions
to
the
rule
would
be
permitted
only
where
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
admission
of
the
evidence
was
supported
by
“salient
and
cogent
reasons”
being
of
the
opinion
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
were
not
such
as
to
render
the
admission
salient
and
cogent.
the
court
held
that
as
applied,
georgia’s
hearsay,
statutory
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
it
violated
evans’
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause.
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
four
reasons
why
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
reversed.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
equating
the
evidentiary
rule
with
the
constitutional
standard.
under
the
traditional
or
wigmore
view,
which
we
urge
to
be
the
appropriate
view,
there
is
an
important
difference
between
the
two.
under
wigmore,
the
hearsay
rule
deals
with
the
competency
of
evidence.
under
whatever
existing
rules
of
evidence
are
then
in
effect,
the
confrontation
clause
according
to
wigmore
deals
with
the
procedure
by
which
testimony
is
presented
to
the
jury
and
that
is
that
it
must
be
presented
by
live
witnesses
who
are
available
for
cross-exam
and
not
by
ex
parte
affidavits
or
the
depositions.
unlike
a
live
witness,
a
piece
of
paper
cannot
be
cross-examined.
in
maddox
versus
united
states,
this
court
cited
with
approval
a
great
number
of
decisions
of
state
courts
such
as
simmons
versus
ohio
which
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
intended
to
effect
the
nature
or
scope
of
testimony
given
by
a
witness
who
was
on
the
stand
and
available
for
cross-examination.
since,
i
last
argued
this
case
of
course
this
court
decided
california
versus
green
which
we
think
goes
a
considerable
way
toward
upholding
our
position
on
this
threshold
error
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
decision
appeared
to
reaffirm
the
statement
in
stein
versus
new
york
that
the
hearsay
rule
was
not
to
be
read
in
to
the
constitution.
surely,
it
is
a
rule
which
is
singularly
undeserving
of
constitutional
status.
the
hearsay
rule
is
unknown
in
most
every
civilized
system
of
jurisprudence.
the
continental
lawyer
throws
up
his
hands
and
wonders
when
you
try
to
explain
it
to
him.
within
the
systems
which
do
have
the
hearsay
rule,
it
is
--
i
would
say
universally
criticized
by
the
writers,
the
law
review
articles.
you
find
as
a
rare
person
that
has
much
good
to
say
about
the
hearsay
rule.
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
the
reformers
all
--
virtually
all
of
whom
are
either
for
a
total
obligation
or
drastic
revision
must
now
fight
the
constitution
as
well
as
too
many
years
of
inertia.
we
urge
the
court
to
reiterate
and
affirm
that
hearsay
rule
is
not
the
same
as
the
confrontation
clause.
moving
beyond
this
threshold
error,
we
would
say
that
perhaps
the
greatest
potential
for
mischief
in
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
is
the
wholly
subjective
test
it
device
for
federal
judges
to
second
guess
state
judges.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
no
matter
how
settled
the
state
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
might
be.
the
application
of
a
state
evidentiary
rule
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
by
a
state
judge
is
now
to
be
subject
to
reversal
if
a
reviewing
federal
judge
perhaps
many
years
later
feels
that
as
he
sees
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
reasons
for
admission
were
not
sufficiently
to
cite
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
salient
or
cogent.
now,
of
course
this
is
no
guide
at
all
for
the
state
trial
judge
who
must
make
a
decision
during
trial.
he
can’t
obviously
to
have
a
recess
and
phone
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
federal
court
of
appeals
or
a
district
court
judge
to
get
agreement
as
to
whether
the
reasons
are
salient
or
cogent.
we
hope
the
court
will
reverse
the
circuit
court
on
the
grounds
of
the
threshold
error.
however,
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
this,
if
hearsay
to
some
extent
or
other
is
to
be
equated
with
the
confrontation
clause,
we
sincerely
hold
that
this
court
will
come
up
with
some
intelligible
objective
standards
so
that
a
state
trial
judge
will
have
some
idea
of
what
to
do
when
the
hearsay
question
comes
up
during
the
trial
of
the
criminal
case.
now,
of
course
if
we
are
incorrect
in
our
view
that
the
hearsay
rule
and
confrontation
clause
are
different
or
for
that
matter,
if
the
overlap
is
substantial
and
if
the
overlap
does
affect
the
scope
of
testimony
as
well
as
the
use
of
ex
parte
affidavits
or
depositions.
we
must
then
deal
with
the
question
of
the
status
of
both
long
recognized
and
for
that
matter
any
new
state
exceptions
to
the
rule.
one
such
exception
of
longstanding
is
the
exception
under
which
the
evidence
here
was
admitted
--
the
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
in
georgia
as
elsewhere,
the
declaration
of
one
conspirator
subject
to
certain
restrictions
is
admissible
against
other
conspirators.
one
general
can
restriction
is
that
the
statement
must
be
made
during
the
pendency
of
the
conspiracy
but
at
last
there
is
great
disagreement
as
to
what
the
pendency
is.
in
georgia,
as
in
many
and
i'm
not
sure
perhaps
most
states,
the
conspiracy
is
viewed
as
continuing
into
the
period
of
concealment
after
the
primary
unlawful
act
or
objective
has
been
accomplished.
this
view
is
supported
by
wharton’s
criminal
evidence
and
is
based
on
what
i
think
is
rather
a
common
sense
approach
that
a
conspirator
has
in
his
mind
or
he
has
an
interest
i
should
say
in
accomplishing
all
objectives
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
can
one
say
that
the
avoidance
of
detection
is
any
less
an
objective
than
committing
the
crime
on
the
first
instance?
i
think
not.
we
recognized
of
course
that
the
federal
view
difference
in
cases
as
krulewitch,
this
court
has
held
that
in
potential
criminal
proceedings
the
conspiracy
terminates
upon
completion
of
the
last
overt
act
in
its
furtherance.
but
krulewitch
clearly
shows
that
this
is
but
the
supervision
of
this
court
over
the
evidentiary
rules
in
federal
criminal
proceedings.
in
fact,
krulewitch
referred
to
georgia
and
other
states
which
have
a
different
view.
it
did
not
hint
that
there
was
anything
unconstitutional
about
georgia
or
the
other
states
adhering
to
this
view.
in
any
event,
we
find
it
hard
to
think
of
any
reason
why
this
difference
of
view
should
be
a
constitutional
issue.
surely,
it
has
no
bearing
upon
the
trustworthiness
justification
which
is
ordinarily
used
in
support
of
the
rules
exceptions.
we
think
that
statement
in
question
clearly
bears
all
the
earmarks
of
being
trustworthy.
to
start
with,
it
was
not
a
long
narrative
statement
where
the
error
or
the
danger
of
error
in
the
retailing
would
be
great.
it
was
a
spontaneous
and
a
simple
spontaneous
exclamation
really
in
the
nature
of
ouch
to
a
specific
question
which
the
declarant
--
excuse
me
in
answer
to
a
question
post
to
the
declarant.
i
assumed
there
would
have
been
no
objection
at
all
if
the
witness
had
testified
as
to
the
physical
reaction
to
his
question
such
as,
anger,
tears
or
flash
face.
what
logical
reason
can
there
be
for
distinguishing
between
the
auditory
and
visual
perceptions
of
the
witness
who
was
on
the
stand
of
the
course.
moreover,
the
statement
to
the
extent
that
it
has
any
significance
at
all
is
obviously
a
declaration
against
interest.
most
use
--
most
normally
declarations
against
interests
are
not
made
unless
they
are
true.
if
measured
by
the
trustworthiness
criterion,
we
think
that
this
spontaneous
exclamation
against
interest
is
at
least
as
trustworthy
as
the
dying
declaration
exception
about
which
apparently
no
one
disagrees.
we
think
it
is
far
more
trustworthy
than
reputation
evidence
which
is
admissible
on
criminal
cases
and
as
the
court
is
aware,
reputation
evidence
not
only
can
be
hearsay,
it
must
be
hearsay
and
can
be
nothing
but
hearsay.
we
think
the
georgia’s
co-conspirator
exception
to
the
rule
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case
is
reasonable,
serves
a
valid
purpose
of
shedding
more
rather
than
less
light
on
the
question
at
issue
and
ought
not
to
be
held
unconstitutional
whether
or
not
the
hearsay
rule
in
confrontation
clause
are
to
be
equated.
coming
then
to
harmless
error,
we
think
that
even
if
the
admission
of
the
declaration
should
against
our
contentions
be
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
we
think
that
it
could
not
conceivably
have
influenced
the
verdict
or
prejudice
the
accused
in
anyway.
it
was
a
testimony
of
wade
truett
which
convicted
evans.
shaw’s
testimony
was
a
wholly
corroborative
and
even
as
corroborative
evidence,
it
was
really
so
constraint
compared
with
the
corroborative
evidence
of
witnesses
such
as
m.c.
perry.
this
court
has
held
that
where
the
erroneous
submission
is
merely
cumulative
and
will
not
affect
the
result,
the
error
is
harmless.
we
think
that
harrington
versus
california
ought
to
control
it
on
this
point.
i
should
like
to
save
my
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
should
like
to
save
my
remaining
time.
