mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to,
for
purposes
of
placing
this
issue
and
where
i
can
say
it
to
be
the
context
of
the
matter,
describe
what
the
georgia
statute
is
held
by
the
supreme
court
and
by
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia
to
mean.
this
statute,
as
applied
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia,
and
if
it’s
from
the
federal
rule
substantial
and
if
as
we
submit
from
the
rules
of
all
of
the
states
that
we
plainted
with,
the
statute
provides
that
once
the
fact
of
conspiracy
has
been
established,
the
acts
and
declaration
of
all
conspirators
are
admissible
into
evidence
against
each
of
them.
one
of
the
flagrant
things
that’s
missing
from
that
statute,
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
that
is
present
in
all
of
the
other
interpretations
of
similar
exceptions
is
that
the
statement
or
declaration
must
have
been
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
that
is
to
say
that
where
two,
for
instance,
might
conspire
to
burglarize
a
grocery
store,
if
one
of
the
conspirators
were
setting
in
the
automobile
outside
the
grocery
store
and
the
other
one
in
it,
i’m
satisfied
that
evidence
as
to
the
acts
of
each
can
be
admitted
against
the
other
to
prove
the
conspiracy
itself
and
to
prove
the
concert
of
action.
likewise,
if
some
declaration
was
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
once
it
had
been
established,
that
is,
using
a
similar
example,
if
one
of
the
conspirators
had
been
designated
the
function
of
going
to
purchase
a
gun
and
maybe
the
two
of
them
went
together
to
purchase
it
and
one
of
them
did
all
of
the
talking,
the
testimony
with
regard
to
what
this
man
stated
to
the
gun
merchant
would
be
admissible
against
both
of
them
if
the
two
were
otherwise
connected
because
these
acts
or
these
declarations
would
have
been
or
could
be
construed
to
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia--
i
refer
to
the
supreme
court
after
i
refer
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
and
a
supreme
court
in
georgia.
these
two
appellate
courts
have,
in
the
past,
recognized
the
rule
to
be,
as
we
have
stated
it,
similar
to
the
founder
of
federal
rule.
that
is,
if
the
act
or
if
the
declaration
were
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
which
have
been
proved,
it
would
be
admissible
against
any
co-conspirator
who
was
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
in
the
older
georgia
cases,
we
have
cited
some
in
our
brief,
have
gone
along
with
this
rule
but,
somewhere
along
the
line
without
ever
overruling
that
rule,
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia
have
dropped
the
furtherance
requirement
and
recognize
only
that
if
a
statement
is
made
during
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
during
its
pendency
then
it’s
admissible
against
all
of
the
co-conspirators
whether
or
not
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
the
parks
annotated
code
which
is
our
oldest
code,
i
believe,
in
georgia.
it
came
from
decisional
law.
our
code
in
georgia,
our
criminal
code,
is
based
upon
decisional
law
basically
and
it
has
grown
from
that,
and
this
is
one
of
the
basic
statutes
that
we
had
in
the
state.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
it’s
enacted
by
the
georgia
legislature
in
this
sense,
if
it
please
the
court.
a
code
committee
was
appointed
and
i
can’t
tell
you
when
it
was.
it
formulated
a
code
for
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
and
the
legislature
enacted
it,
more
or
less,
in
both
as
a
code.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
i
cannot
state--
i
understand
the
court’s
question.
i
cannot
state
whether
it
is
the
typical
co-conspirator
rule.
i
don’t
know
of
one
actually.
the
georgia
statute
and
the
federal--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
believe
that
the
federal
rule
includes
and
is
made
during
the
course
of
and
in
furtherance
of
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
the
question
of
concealment
is
a
second
vice
that
we
have
not
urged
this
boldly
as
we
have
the
question
of
furtherance
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
both
of
these
problems
in
its
opinion.
we
were,
at
that
point,
dwelling
on
the
question
of
furtherance.
under
the
georgia
rule,
of
course
the
courts
have
construed
a
conspiracy
to
continue
so
long
as
the
co-conspirators
are
in
any
way
attempting
to
conceal
the
fact
of
the
crime.
and,
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
the
georgia
court,
actually
up
until
the
time
the
co-conspirators
are
electrocuted,
so
long
as
one
or
more
of
them
deny
the
crime,
we
have
taken
the
leap
that
the
point
have
in
our
brief
and
in
our
argument
not
attacking
so
much
that
facet
of
the
law,
although
we
do
attack
it
but
attacking
the
facet
that
makes
the
declaration
admissible
although
it
not
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
think
that
this
is
much
more
important
for
these
reasons.
we
think
that
a
statement
made
during
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
which
is
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
could
be
much
more
harmful
than
a
statement
made
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
conspiracy
is
being
concealed
if
it
were
in
some
way
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
depict
the
situation
there
where,
during
the
concealment
period,
the--
one
of
the
defendants
or
one
of
the
co-conspirators
continues
laying
the
groundwork
for
future
evidentiary
matters
which
would
attempt
further
to
conceal
it
or,
for
that
matter,
there’s
some
act
they
would
attempt
to
conceal
it.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
we
have
there,
as
i
see
chief
justice’s
question,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
dying
declaration
would
be
admissible,
however,
a
dying
declaration
would
not
be
admissible
under
even
the
dying
declaration
exception
unless
it’s
permanent
to
the
facts
or
otherwise
admissible.
here,
what
if
he
had
said,
for
instance,
that
evans
and
i
had
robbed
every
bank
in
the
country?
this
would
not
be
relative
to
the
murder
issue
and
it
would
not
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
and
we
submit
that
even
as
a
dying
declaration
under
the
facts
that
the
chief
justice
stated,
that
it
would
not
be
admissible
because
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir.
it
would
be
inadmissible
too
for
the
reason
that
it
would
not
be
relevant.
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
well,
i
think
that’s
the
very
point
that
i’m
making.
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
submit
that
these
were
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
and
that
would
not
have
been.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
are
not--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
we
would
submit
that
if--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
under
the
concept
of
the
law,
as
i
understand
it,
it
has
some
reliability
and
trustworthiness
because
a
man
under
the
dying
declaration
statute
does
not
make
a
statement
until
such
time
that
he
is
in
extremes
that
he
knows
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
told
he’s
about
to
meet
his
maker
and
he
would
not
lie.
this
is
a
theory
of
it.
i
think
though
we
go
that
far-a-field
from
what
we’re
talking
about
here,
they--
we--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
correct
and
we
contend
that
it
violates,
of
course,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation
and--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
the
exception
as
to
the
dying
declaration
is
so
well-established
in
our
law,
both
in
a
federal
and
in
a
state
law,
that
i
would
have
a
difficulty
attacking
that.
i
noticed
in
his
argument
the
solicitor
general,
of
course,
would
do
away
with
the
hearsay
rule.
we
are
familiar
with
the
textual
authorities
that
would.
of
course,
we
would
disagree
with
it
but,
in
this
situation,
the
dying
declaration
situation,
since
we
do
not
have
that
case
here,
i’m
not
prone
to
argue
and
i’m
not
prepared
to
argue.
i
would
say
that
i
would
not
be
on
it
as
firm
ground
since
the
exception
is
so
ancient
and
well-recognized.
the
court
and,
again,
point
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
think
are
relevant,
although
all
of
them
are
not
directly
in
point
with
the
issue
we
have
here.
pointer
has
been
mentioned
and
i
would,
just
as
not
by
way
of
refreshment
as
much
as
anything
else,
say
that
in
pointer,
testimony
of
a
witness
given
at
a
preliminary
examination
at
a
time
when
the
defendant
did
not
have
an
attorney
present
was
admitted
against
pointer
on
the
trial,
at
the
primary
trial
of
his
case.
this
was
admitted
on
the
theory
that
the
witness
since
left
the
state
and
did
not
intend
to
return
to
the
state.
now,
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
the
question
was
asked
during
the
course
of
this
argument
of
the
solicitor
general--
the
attorney
general
with
regard
to
the
distinction
between
the
transcript
and
the--
the
transcript
that
was
admitted
and
oral
testimony.
actually,
we
think
it
is
none.
the
court
did
not
point
out
in
its
decision
in
the
pointer
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
think
that
the
transcript
would
be
much
more
reliable
than
the
oral
testimony
of
one
who
heard
the
testimony
of
one
who
put
the
transcript
in
the
form
it
was
in,
the
court
reporter
for
instance.
now,
in
most
states,
i
think
in
the
federal
courts,
that
where
a
witness
has
since
died
and
has
previously
testified
and
been
subject
to
cross-examination,
his
testimony
might
be
related
during
a
subsequent
trial
to
the
jury
from
the
memory
of
one
who
heard
it.
this
is
a
further
exception.
what
i
am
pointing
out
here
is
that,
in
pointer,
we
were
talking
about
confrontation
as
we’re
talking
about
confrontation
here,
and
it
was
not
significant,
we
submit,
in
pointer
that
this
was
a
transcript
as
oppose
to
oral
testimony.
we
think
the
fact
that
something
has
reduced
the
writing,
as
in
some
distinction
has
been
attempted
by
the
attorney
general,
has
no
significance
whether
it
be
oral
or
in
writing.
it
is
a
question
on
confrontation
nevertheless.
in
any
event,
that
was
the
situation
in
pointer.
in
douglas,
the
court
will
recall
as
douglas
versus
alabama
cited
in
our
brief,
the
court
will
recall
that
the
co-defendant
was
placed
on
the
witness
stand.
he
was
asked
to--
some
questions
and
refused
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
might
incriminate
him.
and,
significantly
or
interestingly,
this
situation
was
somewhat
like
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
co-defendant
had
previously
been
tried
and
convicted
in
a
separate
trial
from
the
time
he
was
on
trial.
in
any
event,
the
district
attorney
was
permitted
to
read
to
the
co-defendant
a
confession
that
the
co-defendant
had
given
which
involve
the
defendant
on
trial.
and,
as
he
read
it
from
line
to
line
or
phrase
to
phrase,
he
would
ask
the
co-defendant
who
was
physically
on
the
witness
stand
whether
or
not
he
had
made
such
a
statement,
and
on
each
occasion
the
co-defendant
would
state
“i
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
incriminate
me.”
after
having
this
placed
before
the
jury,
actually
not
in
the
form
of
evidence,
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant,
the
solicitor
or
the
district
attorney
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
to
prove
that
the
co-defendant
who
had
refused
to
testify
have
given
a
confession
had
it
identified,
but
the
confession
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
and
indeed,
under
the
law
of
alabama,
apparently
it
was
not
admissible.
so
here,
again,
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
oral
testimony.
we’re
not
dealing
with
something
necessarily
physical:
a
writing
or
a
transcript
or
a
written
confession.
the
court,
of
course,
in
that
case
held
that
the
co-defendant,
the
one
on
trial,
although
the
witness
against
him
was
physically
on
the
witness
stand,
was
denied
the
right
of
confrontation.
in
bruton
versus
united
states,
this
was
a
court--
a
case
that
arose
in
the
federal
courts
and
it’s
so
recent,
i’m
satisfied,
that
the
justices
remember
the
facts
of
the
case
but,
in
subsequence,
a
confession
of
one
co-conspirator
or
co-defendant
was
admitted
in
the
course
of
the
trial
under
the
then
approved
instructions
that
it
would
be
considered
only
as
to
him
and
not
as
to
the
co-defendant
that
was
mentioned
in
it
but
who
did
not
get
it.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
co-defendant,
as
i
understand.
i
don’t
recall
whether
it
was
a
conspiracy
issue
or
not.
as
i
recall
bruton,
it
was
a
confession
of
a
co-defendant.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
this
is
correct,
sir,
and
i
would
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
wanted
to
get
that
into
context
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
there
are
only
two
others
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
briefly
and
one
of
them--
and
bruton
is
the
one.
i
would
state
that,
under
bruton,
the--
under
the
georgia
rule,
under
the
statute
that
we
have
here
involved
in
georgia,
that
the
confession
in
the
bruton
case
in
a
georgia
court
would
have
been
admitted
without
error.
it
is
admissible
under
the
rule
that
we
have
here
in
question
and
we
have,
again,
cited
a
case
to
that
in
our
brief
where
a
confession
of
a
co-conspirator,
co-defendant
not
on
trial
was
admitted
against
the
defendant
on
trial.
under
this
particular
rule,
it
said
that
the
court
said
in
the
evans
case
and
the
one
we
have
here
under
review,
the
courts
said
under
this
rule
it
was
a
statement
made
during
the
pendency
of
a
conspiracy.
the
conspiracy
contended
until
the
men
are
finally
brought
to
justice.
as
long
as
one
of
them
went
on
denying
their
guilt,
there
is
a
conspiracy.
therefore,
this
is
admissible.
even
though
under
bruton
and,
actually,
under
the
decisions
prior
to
bruton,
it
would
not
have
been
admitted
in
federal
court
and
we
contend,
under
the
confrontation
clause,
we
have
decided--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir,
it
had.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
excuse
me,
sir.
i
think
that
it
had.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
apologize.
it
had
not
been
because
i
recall
actually
writing
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
calling
the
bruton
case
to
the
court’s
attention
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so,
it
would
not
have
been
decided
at
the
time
the
georgia
supreme
court
made
its
decision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
might
mention
that
this
point,
so
fixed
in
georgia
law,
is
the
concept
of
this
statute
as
it
is
applied
in
this
case
and
would
have
been
applied
in
bruton
that
i
cannot
get
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
even
comment
on
the
argument
that
i’m
making
here
before
the
court
today.
i
attack
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
the
district
court
and
i
attacked
the
constitutionality
on
the
same
grounds
we
urge
here
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
while
this
case
was
on
appeal.
the
supreme
court
decided
this
code
section
and
said
the
conspiracy
was
pending
therefore,
this
was
admissible
and
let
it
ride.
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
before
the
supreme
court,
i--
in
order
to
get
down
to
the
real
issues
involved,
eliminating
argument
on
many
of
the
other
issues,
hoping
that
the
court
would
comment
at
least
on
this
issue,
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
rehearing
without
comment
on
the
constitutional
issue.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
under
darden
v.
state
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
a
georgia
supreme
court
defendant,
the
confession
in
bruton
would
have
been
admissible
in
georgia
under
the
georgia
rule.
brookhart
v.
janis,
i
believe,
perhaps
was
the
first
of
these
decisions
that
i
am
in--
chronologically,
that
i
have
recited
in
the
court
but,
whether
or
not
it
was,
in
that
case,
the
defendant
had
waived
counsel
and
waived
certain
of
the
rights
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
on
the
trial
of
the
case
in
an
effort--
well,
not
an
effort
that
was
made.
the
testimony
that
was
given
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
introduced
into
evidence
against
janis.
the
court,
there,
held
that
this
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
janis
did
not
have
an
attorney
or
brookhart,
whichever
one
was
the
complaining
party,
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
had
not
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
cross-examination,
as
we
recall
that
case.
roberts
against
russell,
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
merely
holds
that
the
bruton
rule
is
applicable
to
state
courts.
now,
with
regard
to
the
georgia
statute
in
answering
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
there
was
no
conspiracy
laws
that
was
stated
by
the
attorney
general,
there
was
no
conspiracy
statute,
general
conspiracy
statute
in
georgia.
one
might
be
indicted
in
a--
in
this
case,
he
was--
they
were,
in
an
indictment
charging
the
offense
of
murder
without
the
mention
of
any
conspiracy.
however,
as
the
law
have
developed,
the
decisional
law,
again,
that
georgia
had
developed,
conspiracy,
as
we
know
it,
was
a
rule
of
evidence
and
the
fact
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
could
be
proved
by
what
the
court
would
call
or
what
we
might
refer
to
as
conspiracy
evidence.
in
the
particular
indictments
in
this
case,
no
conspiracy
was
mentioned
but
the
case
was
tried
on
a
theory
of
conspiracy.
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
federal
rule.
i
had--
with
regard
to
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
in
conspiracy
cases,
this
is
a--
the
rule
that
requires
that
the
statement
must
have
been
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
to
be
admissible.
the
attorney
general,
in
his
brief,
gives
some
recognition
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
is
this.
it
gives
lip
services.
we
understand
it
to
the
proposition
that
drew
list
that
the--
in
order
to
be
admissible
and
to
meet
constitutional
standards
and
to
actually
be
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
constitutionally
exception,
i
might
say,
not
a
constitutionally
provided
exception
but
an
exception
which
would
meet
constitutional
standards
that
the
evidence
must
be
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy.
of
course,
we
have
submitted
that
in
this
case--
none
of
the
facts
of
this
case
is
no
concept
under
which
the
statement
under
which
the
statement
attributed
to
williams
could
have
been
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
or
could
have
furthered
it
in
any
way.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
it
is--
as
i
understand
the
statement,
it
is
an
accusatory
statement
in
the
nature
of
an
accusation
and
perhaps
a
confession
as
far
as
williams
is
concerned.
it’s
a
rather
cryptic
statement
to
admit.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
he
was
either
the
ringleader
or
the
murderer.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
the
impact
is
that
he
was
the
instigator
of
a
moving
party.
i
might--
i
don’t--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
according
to
the
evidence
disposed
on
the
record.
we
might
state
that
this
is
one
of
the--
it
points
out
why
we
needed
to
cross-examine
the
offer
of
the
utterer
of
that
statement.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
just
what
he
did
mean.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
could
have
called
williams
to
the
witness
stand
as
a
witness,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
had
the
right
to
call
him.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
might
state
in
that
connection,
if
it
please
the
court,
of
course
he
had
been
tried
one
week
earlier.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
and
convicted,
and
whether
or
not
he
would
have
testified,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
had
subpoena
right.
actually,
we
would
never--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
do
this
by
habeas
corpus
as
a
test
as
we
can,
but
we
wouldn’t
have
that
right.
i’m
certain
that
it
would’ve
been
a
void
test.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
as
a
criminal
practitioner,
i
followed
the
practice
not
to
use
co-conspirators
as
witnesses
in
a
case
generally
because
i
feel
that
a
jury
will
not
accept
that
testimony.
certainly,
if
they
will
not
accept
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself,
they’ll
not
accept
the
testimony
of
williams.
secondly,
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
this
was
a
well-publicized
transaction
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
i
recognize
the
fact
that
i
had
an
uphill
struggle
in
selecting
the
jury
to
try
my
case
and
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
12
men
had,
only
a
week
earlier,
summons
him
today.
i
thought
from
a
strategy
from
the
standpoint
that
it
would
not
be
well
to
call
williams.
i
might
add
also
that
williams
has
a
rather
wrong
chi,
if
that’s
a
good
term
to
use,
criminal
record.
he
could
be
very
successfully
impeached
by
use
of
his
criminal
record.
we
felt
that
it
would
not
be
availing
to
use
in
both
from
a
strategy
standpoint
and
a
practical
standpoint.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
would
not
have
had
that
power.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
about
the--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
and
i
was
saving
that
for
last,
and
i’m
about
to
approach
that
unless
the
court
would
like
for
me
to
approach
it
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
alright,
sir.
i
will
make
it
in
two
minutes
then.
i
would
point
out
that
what
actually
the
state
is
attempting
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
get
the
court
to
reverse
pointer
or
overrule
pointer,
douglas,
brookhart,
bruton,
and
roberts.
we
think
that
in
order
to
rule
as
the
state
would
have
the
court
rule.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
overrule
those
decisions
to
certainly
diminish
their
effects
from
substantially.
under
the
harmless
error
rule,
as
decided
by
this
court
in
chaplin
versus
california,
the
court
would
have
to
declare
that
it
was
a
harmless
error
beyond
reasonable
doubt
before
that
would
be
applicable
here.
this
court
is
incidentally,
as
we
understood
brookhart
v.
janis,
as
we
understood
the
code
in
that
case,
it
said
this
error
is
so
fundamental
that
it
isn’t--
the
denial
of
confrontation
is
isn’t
so
fundamental
that
prejudice
need
not
be
shown,
that
it
will
be
presumed.
that
since
that
time
the
court
has
decided
that,
very
recently,
the
case
of
harrington
versus
california
in
which
it
held
that
the
denial
of
confrontation
to
be
harmless
error,
but
i
will
hastily
run
over
reasons
why
i
think
this
is
not
harmless
error.
first
of
all,
under
georgia
law,
in
order
for
a
conspiracy
to
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness,
the
testimony
by
a--
an
accomplice,
i
should
say,
the
testimony
must
be
corroborated.
this
was
a
corroboration
of
the
testimony.
we
think
that
this
tended
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
truett
and,
therefore,
could
not
have
been
harmless.
truett
was
the
only
real
evidenced
in
the
case,
what
he
testified
to.
under
the
evidence
in
the
case,
he
had
been
given
immunity
from
prosecution
for
triple
murder
also
have
been
promised
assistance
in
securing
parole
from
a
federal
summons
that
he
was
serving
and
perhaps
other
inducements.
we
think
that
this
was
a
post
case
from
that
standpoint,
and
that
shows
testimony
as
to
a
statement
made
by
a
co-defendant
might
well
have
turned
the
tide.
the
statement,
as
we
stated,
is
an
accusatory
statement.
we
are
satisfied
of
that.
the
state
thought
so
at
the
time
it
brought
mr.
shaw
from
federal
penitentiary
in
atlanta
to
gwinnett
county
to
testify
solely
to
this.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
this
was
the
only
testimony
that
mr.
shaw
testified
to.
he
lied
on
his
own
and
i
assume,
under
the
rules,
i’d
have
to--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
know
i’m
out
of
order
to
ask
you
one
moment,
one
summons
to
come
answer
what
had
just
been
said,
but
i
would
like
to
state
that
under
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
cases
such
as
this,
has
now
held
that
a
case
otherwise
subject
to
witherspoon
would
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
penalty
only.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
on
the
issue
of
penalty
only.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to,
for
purposes
of
placing
this
issue
and
where
i
can
say
it
to
be
the
context
of
the
matter,
describe
what
the
georgia
statute
is
held
by
the
supreme
court
and
by
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia
to
mean.
this
statute,
as
applied
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia,
and
if
it’s
from
the
federal
rule
substantial
and
if
as
we
submit
from
the
rules
of
all
of
the
states
that
we
plainted
with,
the
statute
provides
that
once
the
fact
of
conspiracy
has
been
established,
the
acts
and
declaration
of
all
conspirators
are
admissible
into
evidence
against
each
of
them.
one
of
the
flagrant
things
that’s
missing
from
that
statute,
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
that
is
present
in
all
of
the
other
interpretations
of
similar
exceptions
is
that
the
statement
or
declaration
must
have
been
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
that
is
to
say
that
where
two,
for
instance,
might
conspire
to
burglarize
a
grocery
store,
if
one
of
the
conspirators
were
setting
in
the
automobile
outside
the
grocery
store
and
the
other
one
in
it,
i’m
satisfied
that
evidence
as
to
the
acts
of
each
can
be
admitted
against
the
other
to
prove
the
conspiracy
itself
and
to
prove
the
concert
of
action.
likewise,
if
some
declaration
was
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
once
it
had
been
established,
that
is,
using
a
similar
example,
if
one
of
the
conspirators
had
been
designated
the
function
of
going
to
purchase
a
gun
and
maybe
the
two
of
them
went
together
to
purchase
it
and
one
of
them
did
all
of
the
talking,
the
testimony
with
regard
to
what
this
man
stated
to
the
gun
merchant
would
be
admissible
against
both
of
them
if
the
two
were
otherwise
connected
because
these
acts
or
these
declarations
would
have
been
or
could
be
construed
to
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia--
i
refer
to
the
supreme
court
after
i
refer
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
and
a
supreme
court
in
georgia.
these
two
appellate
courts
have,
in
the
past,
recognized
the
rule
to
be,
as
we
have
stated
it,
similar
to
the
founder
of
federal
rule.
that
is,
if
the
act
or
if
the
declaration
were
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
which
have
been
proved,
it
would
be
admissible
against
any
co-conspirator
who
was
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
in
the
older
georgia
cases,
we
have
cited
some
in
our
brief,
have
gone
along
with
this
rule
but,
somewhere
along
the
line
without
ever
overruling
that
rule,
the
appellate
courts
of
georgia
have
dropped
the
furtherance
requirement
and
recognize
only
that
if
a
statement
is
made
during
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
during
its
pendency
then
it’s
admissible
against
all
of
the
co-conspirators
whether
or
not
it
was
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
the
parks
annotated
code
which
is
our
oldest
code,
i
believe,
in
georgia.
it
came
from
decisional
law.
our
code
in
georgia,
our
criminal
code,
is
based
upon
decisional
law
basically
and
it
has
grown
from
that,
and
this
is
one
of
the
basic
statutes
that
we
had
in
the
state.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
it’s
enacted
by
the
georgia
legislature
in
this
sense,
if
it
please
the
court.
a
code
committee
was
appointed
and
i
can’t
tell
you
when
it
was.
it
formulated
a
code
for
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
and
the
legislature
enacted
it,
more
or
less,
in
both
as
a
code.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
i
cannot
state--
i
understand
the
court’s
question.
i
cannot
state
whether
it
is
the
typical
co-conspirator
rule.
i
don’t
know
of
one
actually.
the
georgia
statute
and
the
federal--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
believe
that
the
federal
rule
includes
and
is
made
during
the
course
of
and
in
furtherance
of
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
the
question
of
concealment
is
a
second
vice
that
we
have
not
urged
this
boldly
as
we
have
the
question
of
furtherance
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
both
of
these
problems
in
its
opinion.
we
were,
at
that
point,
dwelling
on
the
question
of
furtherance.
under
the
georgia
rule,
of
course
the
courts
have
construed
a
conspiracy
to
continue
so
long
as
the
co-conspirators
are
in
any
way
attempting
to
conceal
the
fact
of
the
crime.
and,
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
the
georgia
court,
actually
up
until
the
time
the
co-conspirators
are
electrocuted,
so
long
as
one
or
more
of
them
deny
the
crime,
we
have
taken
the
leap
that
the
point
have
in
our
brief
and
in
our
argument
not
attacking
so
much
that
facet
of
the
law,
although
we
do
attack
it
but
attacking
the
facet
that
makes
the
declaration
admissible
although
it
not
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
think
that
this
is
much
more
important
for
these
reasons.
we
think
that
a
statement
made
during
the
course
of
a
conspiracy
which
is
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
could
be
much
more
harmful
than
a
statement
made
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
conspiracy
is
being
concealed
if
it
were
in
some
way
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
depict
the
situation
there
where,
during
the
concealment
period,
the--
one
of
the
defendants
or
one
of
the
co-conspirators
continues
laying
the
groundwork
for
future
evidentiary
matters
which
would
attempt
further
to
conceal
it
or,
for
that
matter,
there’s
some
act
they
would
attempt
to
conceal
it.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir,
i
think
not.
we
have
there,
as
i
see
chief
justice’s
question,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
dying
declaration
would
be
admissible,
however,
a
dying
declaration
would
not
be
admissible
under
even
the
dying
declaration
exception
unless
it’s
permanent
to
the
facts
or
otherwise
admissible.
here,
what
if
he
had
said,
for
instance,
that
evans
and
i
had
robbed
every
bank
in
the
country?
this
would
not
be
relative
to
the
murder
issue
and
it
would
not
be
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
and
we
submit
that
even
as
a
dying
declaration
under
the
facts
that
the
chief
justice
stated,
that
it
would
not
be
admissible
because
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir.
it
would
be
inadmissible
too
for
the
reason
that
it
would
not
be
relevant.
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
well,
i
think
that’s
the
very
point
that
i’m
making.
it
would
not
have
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
we
submit
that
these
were
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
and
that
would
not
have
been.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
are
not--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
we
would
submit
that
if--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
under
the
concept
of
the
law,
as
i
understand
it,
it
has
some
reliability
and
trustworthiness
because
a
man
under
the
dying
declaration
statute
does
not
make
a
statement
until
such
time
that
he
is
in
extremes
that
he
knows
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
told
he’s
about
to
meet
his
maker
and
he
would
not
lie.
this
is
a
theory
of
it.
i
think
though
we
go
that
far-a-field
from
what
we’re
talking
about
here,
they--
we--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
that
is
correct
and
we
contend
that
it
violates,
of
course,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation
and--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
the
exception
as
to
the
dying
declaration
is
so
well-established
in
our
law,
both
in
a
federal
and
in
a
state
law,
that
i
would
have
a
difficulty
attacking
that.
i
noticed
in
his
argument
the
solicitor
general,
of
course,
would
do
away
with
the
hearsay
rule.
we
are
familiar
with
the
textual
authorities
that
would.
of
course,
we
would
disagree
with
it
but,
in
this
situation,
the
dying
declaration
situation,
since
we
do
not
have
that
case
here,
i’m
not
prone
to
argue
and
i’m
not
prepared
to
argue.
i
would
say
that
i
would
not
be
on
it
as
firm
ground
since
the
exception
is
so
ancient
and
well-recognized.
the
court
and,
again,
point
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
think
are
relevant,
although
all
of
them
are
not
directly
in
point
with
the
issue
we
have
here.
pointer
has
been
mentioned
and
i
would,
just
as
not
by
way
of
refreshment
as
much
as
anything
else,
say
that
in
pointer,
testimony
of
a
witness
given
at
a
preliminary
examination
at
a
time
when
the
defendant
did
not
have
an
attorney
present
was
admitted
against
pointer
on
the
trial,
at
the
primary
trial
of
his
case.
this
was
admitted
on
the
theory
that
the
witness
since
left
the
state
and
did
not
intend
to
return
to
the
state.
now,
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
the
question
was
asked
during
the
course
of
this
argument
of
the
solicitor
general--
the
attorney
general
with
regard
to
the
distinction
between
the
transcript
and
the--
the
transcript
that
was
admitted
and
oral
testimony.
actually,
we
think
it
is
none.
the
court
did
not
point
out
in
its
decision
in
the
pointer
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
think
that
the
transcript
would
be
much
more
reliable
than
the
oral
testimony
of
one
who
heard
the
testimony
of
one
who
put
the
transcript
in
the
form
it
was
in,
the
court
reporter
for
instance.
now,
in
most
states,
i
think
in
the
federal
courts,
that
where
a
witness
has
since
died
and
has
previously
testified
and
been
subject
to
cross-examination,
his
testimony
might
be
related
during
a
subsequent
trial
to
the
jury
from
the
memory
of
one
who
heard
it.
this
is
a
further
exception.
what
i
am
pointing
out
here
is
that,
in
pointer,
we
were
talking
about
confrontation
as
we’re
talking
about
confrontation
here,
and
it
was
not
significant,
we
submit,
in
pointer
that
this
was
a
transcript
as
oppose
to
oral
testimony.
we
think
the
fact
that
something
has
reduced
the
writing,
as
in
some
distinction
has
been
attempted
by
the
attorney
general,
has
no
significance
whether
it
be
oral
or
in
writing.
it
is
a
question
on
confrontation
nevertheless.
in
any
event,
that
was
the
situation
in
pointer.
in
douglas,
the
court
will
recall
as
douglas
versus
alabama
cited
in
our
brief,
the
court
will
recall
that
the
co-defendant
was
placed
on
the
witness
stand.
he
was
asked
to--
some
questions
and
refused
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
might
incriminate
him.
and,
significantly
or
interestingly,
this
situation
was
somewhat
like
the
situation
we
have
here.
the
co-defendant
had
previously
been
tried
and
convicted
in
a
separate
trial
from
the
time
he
was
on
trial.
in
any
event,
the
district
attorney
was
permitted
to
read
to
the
co-defendant
a
confession
that
the
co-defendant
had
given
which
involve
the
defendant
on
trial.
and,
as
he
read
it
from
line
to
line
or
phrase
to
phrase,
he
would
ask
the
co-defendant
who
was
physically
on
the
witness
stand
whether
or
not
he
had
made
such
a
statement,
and
on
each
occasion
the
co-defendant
would
state
“i
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
incriminate
me.”
after
having
this
placed
before
the
jury,
actually
not
in
the
form
of
evidence,
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant,
the
solicitor
or
the
district
attorney
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
to
prove
that
the
co-defendant
who
had
refused
to
testify
have
given
a
confession
had
it
identified,
but
the
confession
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
and
indeed,
under
the
law
of
alabama,
apparently
it
was
not
admissible.
so
here,
again,
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
oral
testimony.
we’re
not
dealing
with
something
necessarily
physical:
a
writing
or
a
transcript
or
a
written
confession.
the
court,
of
course,
in
that
case
held
that
the
co-defendant,
the
one
on
trial,
although
the
witness
against
him
was
physically
on
the
witness
stand,
was
denied
the
right
of
confrontation.
in
bruton
versus
united
states,
this
was
a
court--
a
case
that
arose
in
the
federal
courts
and
it’s
so
recent,
i’m
satisfied,
that
the
justices
remember
the
facts
of
the
case
but,
in
subsequence,
a
confession
of
one
co-conspirator
or
co-defendant
was
admitted
in
the
course
of
the
trial
under
the
then
approved
instructions
that
it
would
be
considered
only
as
to
him
and
not
as
to
the
co-defendant
that
was
mentioned
in
it
but
who
did
not
get
it.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
co-defendant,
as
i
understand.
i
don’t
recall
whether
it
was
a
conspiracy
issue
or
not.
as
i
recall
bruton,
it
was
a
confession
of
a
co-defendant.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
this
is
correct,
sir,
and
i
would
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
wanted
to
get
that
into
context
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
there
are
only
two
others
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
briefly
and
one
of
them--
and
bruton
is
the
one.
i
would
state
that,
under
bruton,
the--
under
the
georgia
rule,
under
the
statute
that
we
have
here
involved
in
georgia,
that
the
confession
in
the
bruton
case
in
a
georgia
court
would
have
been
admitted
without
error.
it
is
admissible
under
the
rule
that
we
have
here
in
question
and
we
have,
again,
cited
a
case
to
that
in
our
brief
where
a
confession
of
a
co-conspirator,
co-defendant
not
on
trial
was
admitted
against
the
defendant
on
trial.
under
this
particular
rule,
it
said
that
the
court
said
in
the
evans
case
and
the
one
we
have
here
under
review,
the
courts
said
under
this
rule
it
was
a
statement
made
during
the
pendency
of
a
conspiracy.
the
conspiracy
contended
until
the
men
are
finally
brought
to
justice.
as
long
as
one
of
them
went
on
denying
their
guilt,
there
is
a
conspiracy.
therefore,
this
is
admissible.
even
though
under
bruton
and,
actually,
under
the
decisions
prior
to
bruton,
it
would
not
have
been
admitted
in
federal
court
and
we
contend,
under
the
confrontation
clause,
we
have
decided--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir,
it
had.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
excuse
me,
sir.
i
think
that
it
had.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
apologize.
it
had
not
been
because
i
recall
actually
writing
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
calling
the
bruton
case
to
the
court’s
attention
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so,
it
would
not
have
been
decided
at
the
time
the
georgia
supreme
court
made
its
decision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
might
mention
that
this
point,
so
fixed
in
georgia
law,
is
the
concept
of
this
statute
as
it
is
applied
in
this
case
and
would
have
been
applied
in
bruton
that
i
cannot
get
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
even
comment
on
the
argument
that
i’m
making
here
before
the
court
today.
i
attack
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
the
district
court
and
i
attacked
the
constitutionality
on
the
same
grounds
we
urge
here
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
while
this
case
was
on
appeal.
the
supreme
court
decided
this
code
section
and
said
the
conspiracy
was
pending
therefore,
this
was
admissible
and
let
it
ride.
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
before
the
supreme
court,
i--
in
order
to
get
down
to
the
real
issues
involved,
eliminating
argument
on
many
of
the
other
issues,
hoping
that
the
court
would
comment
at
least
on
this
issue,
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
rehearing
without
comment
on
the
constitutional
issue.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
under
darden
v.
state
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
a
georgia
supreme
court
defendant,
the
confession
in
bruton
would
have
been
admissible
in
georgia
under
the
georgia
rule.
brookhart
v.
janis,
i
believe,
perhaps
was
the
first
of
these
decisions
that
i
am
in--
chronologically,
that
i
have
recited
in
the
court
but,
whether
or
not
it
was,
in
that
case,
the
defendant
had
waived
counsel
and
waived
certain
of
the
rights
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
on
the
trial
of
the
case
in
an
effort--
well,
not
an
effort
that
was
made.
the
testimony
that
was
given
at
the
preliminary
hearing
was
introduced
into
evidence
against
janis.
the
court,
there,
held
that
this
was
a
denial
of
confrontation.
janis
did
not
have
an
attorney
or
brookhart,
whichever
one
was
the
complaining
party,
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
had
not
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
cross-examination,
as
we
recall
that
case.
roberts
against
russell,
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
merely
holds
that
the
bruton
rule
is
applicable
to
state
courts.
now,
with
regard
to
the
georgia
statute
in
answering
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
there
was
no
conspiracy
laws
that
was
stated
by
the
attorney
general,
there
was
no
conspiracy
statute,
general
conspiracy
statute
in
georgia.
one
might
be
indicted
in
a--
in
this
case,
he
was--
they
were,
in
an
indictment
charging
the
offense
of
murder
without
the
mention
of
any
conspiracy.
however,
as
the
law
have
developed,
the
decisional
law,
again,
that
georgia
had
developed,
conspiracy,
as
we
know
it,
was
a
rule
of
evidence
and
the
fact
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
could
be
proved
by
what
the
court
would
call
or
what
we
might
refer
to
as
conspiracy
evidence.
in
the
particular
indictments
in
this
case,
no
conspiracy
was
mentioned
but
the
case
was
tried
on
a
theory
of
conspiracy.
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
federal
rule.
i
had--
with
regard
to
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
in
conspiracy
cases,
this
is
a--
the
rule
that
requires
that
the
statement
must
have
been
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
and
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
to
be
admissible.
the
attorney
general,
in
his
brief,
gives
some
recognition
to
the
fact
that
the
rule
is
this.
it
gives
lip
services.
we
understand
it
to
the
proposition
that
drew
list
that
the--
in
order
to
be
admissible
and
to
meet
constitutional
standards
and
to
actually
be
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
constitutionally
exception,
i
might
say,
not
a
constitutionally
provided
exception
but
an
exception
which
would
meet
constitutional
standards
that
the
evidence
must
be
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy.
of
course,
we
have
submitted
that
in
this
case--
none
of
the
facts
of
this
case
is
no
concept
under
which
the
statement
under
which
the
statement
attributed
to
williams
could
have
been
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
or
could
have
furthered
it
in
any
way.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
it
is--
as
i
understand
the
statement,
it
is
an
accusatory
statement
in
the
nature
of
an
accusation
and
perhaps
a
confession
as
far
as
williams
is
concerned.
it’s
a
rather
cryptic
statement
to
admit.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
he
was
either
the
ringleader
or
the
murderer.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
the
impact
is
that
he
was
the
instigator
of
a
moving
party.
i
might--
i
don’t--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
according
to
the
evidence
disposed
on
the
record.
we
might
state
that
this
is
one
of
the--
it
points
out
why
we
needed
to
cross-examine
the
offer
of
the
utterer
of
that
statement.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
just
what
he
did
mean.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
could
have
called
williams
to
the
witness
stand
as
a
witness,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
had
the
right
to
call
him.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
might
state
in
that
connection,
if
it
please
the
court,
of
course
he
had
been
tried
one
week
earlier.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
and
convicted,
and
whether
or
not
he
would
have
testified,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
we
had
subpoena
right.
actually,
we
would
never--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
do
this
by
habeas
corpus
as
a
test
as
we
can,
but
we
wouldn’t
have
that
right.
i’m
certain
that
it
would’ve
been
a
void
test.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
as
a
criminal
practitioner,
i
followed
the
practice
not
to
use
co-conspirators
as
witnesses
in
a
case
generally
because
i
feel
that
a
jury
will
not
accept
that
testimony.
certainly,
if
they
will
not
accept
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself,
they’ll
not
accept
the
testimony
of
williams.
secondly,
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
this
was
a
well-publicized
transaction
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
i
recognize
the
fact
that
i
had
an
uphill
struggle
in
selecting
the
jury
to
try
my
case
and
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
12
men
had,
only
a
week
earlier,
summons
him
today.
i
thought
from
a
strategy
from
the
standpoint
that
it
would
not
be
well
to
call
williams.
i
might
add
also
that
williams
has
a
rather
wrong
chi,
if
that’s
a
good
term
to
use,
criminal
record.
he
could
be
very
successfully
impeached
by
use
of
his
criminal
record.
we
felt
that
it
would
not
be
availing
to
use
in
both
from
a
strategy
standpoint
and
a
practical
standpoint.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
would
not
have
had
that
power.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
about
the--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
i
wanted
to
get
to
that
and
i
was
saving
that
for
last,
and
i’m
about
to
approach
that
unless
the
court
would
like
for
me
to
approach
it
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
alright,
sir.
i
will
make
it
in
two
minutes
then.
i
would
point
out
that
what
actually
the
state
is
attempting
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
get
the
court
to
reverse
pointer
or
overrule
pointer,
douglas,
brookhart,
bruton,
and
roberts.
we
think
that
in
order
to
rule
as
the
state
would
have
the
court
rule.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
overrule
those
decisions
to
certainly
diminish
their
effects
from
substantially.
under
the
harmless
error
rule,
as
decided
by
this
court
in
chaplin
versus
california,
the
court
would
have
to
declare
that
it
was
a
harmless
error
beyond
reasonable
doubt
before
that
would
be
applicable
here.
this
court
is
incidentally,
as
we
understood
brookhart
v.
janis,
as
we
understood
the
code
in
that
case,
it
said
this
error
is
so
fundamental
that
it
isn’t--
the
denial
of
confrontation
is
isn’t
so
fundamental
that
prejudice
need
not
be
shown,
that
it
will
be
presumed.
that
since
that
time
the
court
has
decided
that,
very
recently,
the
case
of
harrington
versus
california
in
which
it
held
that
the
denial
of
confrontation
to
be
harmless
error,
but
i
will
hastily
run
over
reasons
why
i
think
this
is
not
harmless
error.
first
of
all,
under
georgia
law,
in
order
for
a
conspiracy
to
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness,
the
testimony
by
a--
an
accomplice,
i
should
say,
the
testimony
must
be
corroborated.
this
was
a
corroboration
of
the
testimony.
we
think
that
this
tended
to
corroborate
the
testimony
of
truett
and,
therefore,
could
not
have
been
harmless.
truett
was
the
only
real
evidenced
in
the
case,
what
he
testified
to.
under
the
evidence
in
the
case,
he
had
been
given
immunity
from
prosecution
for
triple
murder
also
have
been
promised
assistance
in
securing
parole
from
a
federal
summons
that
he
was
serving
and
perhaps
other
inducements.
we
think
that
this
was
a
post
case
from
that
standpoint,
and
that
shows
testimony
as
to
a
statement
made
by
a
co-defendant
might
well
have
turned
the
tide.
the
statement,
as
we
stated,
is
an
accusatory
statement.
we
are
satisfied
of
that.
the
state
thought
so
at
the
time
it
brought
mr.
shaw
from
federal
penitentiary
in
atlanta
to
gwinnett
county
to
testify
solely
to
this.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir.
this
was
the
only
testimony
that
mr.
shaw
testified
to.
he
lied
on
his
own
and
i
assume,
under
the
rules,
i’d
have
to--
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
yes,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
if
it
please
the
court,
i
know
i’m
out
of
order
to
ask
you
one
moment,
one
summons
to
come
answer
what
had
just
been
said,
but
i
would
like
to
state
that
under
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
cases
such
as
this,
has
now
held
that
a
case
otherwise
subject
to
witherspoon
would
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
penalty
only.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
on
the
issue
of
penalty
only.
mr.
robert
b.
thompson
thank
you
very
much.
