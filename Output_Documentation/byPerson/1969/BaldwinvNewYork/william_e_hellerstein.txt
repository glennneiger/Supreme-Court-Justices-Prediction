mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
city,
(inaudible)
which
is
comprised
is
the
only
jurisdiction
in
this
country
that
denies
to
its
citizens
a
right
to
jury
trial
for
a
crime
punishable
by
as
much
as
one-year
imprisonment.
indeed
in
the
remaining
57
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york,
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
of
six
requiring
unanimous
verdict.
thus
the
question
which
this
case
brings
to
this
court
whether
section
40
of
the
new
york
city
criminal
code
act
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief
violates
the
sixth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
in
the
fourteenth
in
denying
jury
trial
for
what
we
deem
to
be
a
serious
offense
and
also
in
view
of
the
provision
for
jury
trial
elsewhere
in
the
state
of
new
york
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
is
so
violated.
the
records
of
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
the
appellant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
primarily
mr.
justice
harlan
in
that
the
state
of
new
york
making
available
to
all
its
residents
except
those
who
reside
in
the
city
of
new
york,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yeah.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
no
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
where
the
state
has
undertaken
to
provide
most
of
its
citizenry
apart
from
one
city
with
the
right
to
jury
trial
given
what
this
court
has
said
in
duncan
about
the
importance
of
right
to
jury
trial
as
provided
by
the
state.
indeed
in
the
deciding
duncan,
this
court
looked
to
the
states
to
see
how
important
that
right
was
and
they
found
that
it
was
applied
and
provided
for
in
all
the
states.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
that
now
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
if
that's
all
that's
involved
then
there
is
no
problem
there
because
if
new
york
is
the
only
state
which,
new
york
city
indeed,
was
the
only
state
which
has
a
problem
that
is
before
this
court
namely
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
a
year
then
we
don't
have
to
equalize
anything
among
the
other
states
because
this
court
has
already
decided
that
a
six-month
period
of
time
on
an
offense
is
petty
and
since
all
the
other
states
do
not
deprive
anybody
of
a
jury
trial
for
a
years
a
time
then
there
is
no
equalization
required
between
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
country.
there
is
equalization
required
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
state,
but
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
equal
protection
argument
a
bit
later.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
record
--
the
facts
were
essentially
very
simple.
this
defendant,
appellant
was
convicted
after
a
one-judge
bench
trial
for
the
crime
of
jostling
and
sentenced
to
one-year
imprisonment.
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
he
was
observed
with
his
co-defendant
crowding
a
woman
on
an
escalator
and
the
(inaudible)
terminal.
the
arresting
officer
said
that
he
saw
defendant
take
either
a
loose
cash,
money
from
the
woman's
handbag
or
a
$10
bill.
a
motion
for
a
jury
trial
was
made
in
the
criminal
court
and
it
was
denied.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
by
majority
decision,
five
to
two
felt
that
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
did
not
require
a
holding
that
one-year
was
a
serious
crime
nor
did
it
require
any
different
holding
on
equal
protection.
the
justices
who
dissented,
justice
burke
and
keating
took
a
much
different
view
and
of
course
it's
much
more
consonant
with
our
position.
essentially,
our
sixth
amendment
argument
is
really
broken
down
to
three
parts.
we
think
that
although
duncan
did
not
decide
this
question,
the
thrust
of
duncan,
the
logic
of
duncan
resolves
the
issue
for
us.
however,
we
also
feel
that
if
your
honors
would
accredit
new
york's
looking
at
its
own
historical
experience
to
deprive
the
appellant
of
a
jury
trial
that
even
under
what
we
concede
to
be
erroneous
criteria,
our
argument
still
prevails.
and
the
people
had
misunderstood
our
argument
on
this
point
because
they
seem
to
say
in
their
brief
that
we
offer
to
the
court
as
an
affirmative
indication
of
our
position.
we
are
saying
that
if
we
will
force
to
it,
we
can
win
our
case
even
under
the
criteria
of
new
york
court
of
appeals
followed,
even
though
we
think
its
broad.
thirdly,
i
think
perhaps
the
ghost
in
the
closet
on
this
case
has
to
be
the
question
of
the
impact
of
the
court's
decision
on
the
criminal
court,
the
problem
in
new
york
city
because
i
really
believe
if
this
case
had
come
from
casanovia,
or
people
--
as
the
people
would
have
it,
this
would
not
be
a
consideration.
now,
although
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
spoke
of
the
problems
of
new
york
criminal
court
on
the
equal
protection
issue,
i
can't
help
but
feel
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
grips
with
that,
end
of
the
argument
on
sixth
amendment
lurking
behind
the
problem
this
court
faces
is
the
problem
of
the
calendar
chaos
in
new
york
criminal
court.
hence,
looking
towards
the
decision
in
duncan,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
looked
to
what
it
called
the
objective
criteria,
chiefly
the
existing
laws
and
the
practices
of
the
nation
to
decide
whether
louisiana's
assault
statute
requiring
a
two
year
maximum
of
imprisonment
was
a
serious
or
petty
offense.
looking
to
national
criteria,
the
court
found
that
nowhere
else
in
the
land
was
a
two-year
of
sentence
of
countenance
without
a
right
to
jury
trial.
applying
that
method
of
analysis,
the
court
would
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
new
york
city,
namely
that
nowhere
else
in
the
land
does
the
situation
prevail
in
which
a
defendant
faced
with
one-year
imprisonment
is
denied
a
right
to
jury
trial.
so
section
4
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
you
are
getting
to
what
the
people
--
i
think
hang
their
case
on,
i
might
say,
namely
that
our
position
depends
on
whether
we
are
entitled
to
a
common
law
jury
or
not
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
error
for
the
same
reason
that
it
was
an
error
or
at
least
a
relevant
decision
in
duncan.
primarily
in
duncan,
the
court,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bloom,
mr.
justice
white's
footnote,
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
all
discussed
whether
the
entire
bag
and
baggage
of
the
sixth
amendment
must
come
with
the
duncan
decision.
it's
a
question
left
opened
in
the
duncan.
the
unanimous
jury,
the
twelve-man
jury,
i
think
again
that
this
is
a
question
left
open
in
this
case
and
which
--
one
which
we
need
not
resolve
because
all
and
i
think
in
depending
on
duncan
that
we
are
asking
for
is
some
form
a
jury
trial.
for
instance
in
louisiana
after
duncan,
the
jury
trial
which
is
now
provided
is
not
a
common
law.
unanimous
jury,
is
a
five
man
jury
for
the
one-year
crime.
what
louisiana
did
is
they
knocked
a
lot
of
crime
down
to
six
months
and
for
the
ones
that
were
over,
they
provided
a
five
man
jury.
i
don't
think
the
record
in
this
case
nor
the
issue
on
this
case
has
to
depend
on
whether
a
sixth
amendment
jury
with
all
its
bag
and
baggage
is
required.
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
therefore
is
they
looked
away
from
duncan
and
at
least
read
duncan
to
authorize
looking
to
its
own
historical
experience,
namely
that
in
new
york
we
have
always
considered
a
misdemeanor
a
petty
offense
and
a
felony
a
serious
offense
and
that
one-year
decided
which
was
which?
but
the
six-months
cutoff
nation
with
--
nationwide
and
even
historically
has
much
more
support
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
jury
trial
than
does
the
one-year
cutoff
upon
which
the
people
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
based
their
opinion.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
your
honor,
it
would
preclude
the
state
from
denying
a
jury
trial
for
anything
more
than
a
six-month
period
of
imprisonment
unless
of
course
the
court
upon
reconsideration
of
a
decision,
it
could
be
forthcoming
in
this
case
and
in
duncan,
might
--
would
reconsider
on
a
full
record
what
the
problem
warrants.
i
think
that
its
interesting
in
the
people's
brief,
they
attempt
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
minnesota
experience
with
requiring
a
jury
trial
in
a
certain
lesser
crime
situations
by
showing
that
there
were
delays
that
will
result
in.
their
brief
doesn't
reflect
however
the
next
two
lines
of
the
minnesota
law
review
article
which
also
discloses
that
the
bar
association
of
minnesota
in
a
response
to
the
delay
and
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
should
remain
in
vivo,
recommend
it
that
it
was
much
more
important
to
retain
the
jury
system
than
to
just
disregard
it
as
a
result
of
some
momentary
shortage
of
space
and
the
facility
but
i'd
get
to
that
again
later.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
sixth
month
cutoff
has
historical
significance.
this
court
in
the
duncan
mentioned
the
fact
that
for
the
most
part
in
the
18th
century,
the
six-month
cutoff
with
exceptions
was
a
general
experience.
also,
the
reason
why
new
york's
experience
doesn't
really
help
is
that
new
york's
experience
was
not
the
only
type
of
experience
the
colonies
had
had.
new
york,
new
jersey
as
late
justice
frankfurter
in
his
article
--
mr.
cockrin
point
out
are
much
harsher
than
the
denial
of
trial
by
a
jury
than
many
of
the
other
colonies.
so
an
attempt
to
locate
in
history
exactly
what's
at
stake
is
not
really
a
fruitful
thing
but
i
think
we've
got
the
better
of
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
were
and
more
lenient,
there
were
more
lenient
policies
in
the
colony.
i
think
its
interesting
that
to
note
that
at
least
two
commentators,
professor
herbal
in
our
brief
think
that
the
new
york's
denial
of
jury
trial
in
serious
and
in
petty
offenses
or
serious
offenses
depending
on
where
you
place
the
label
has
something
to
do
with
the
aristocratic
structure
of
the
colony.
i
view
the
new
york
experience,
although
we
affirmed
consistently
over
the
years
by
the
court,
sort
of
a
vestige
of
this
old
colonial
policy.
the
dissenting
opinion
as
we
do
took
the
position
that
you
couldn't
tell
even
if
you
cannot
look
to
the
new
york
experience
that
the
citizens
of
new
york
had
not
opted,
had
not
felt
that
over
six
months
was
a
serious
offense.
for
the
reason
that
the
legislature
had
given
a
jury
trial
elsewhere
in
the
state
and
that
in
the
recent
constitutional
convention,
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
drafted
the
constitution
with
a
new
provision
which
this
court
called
attention
to
in
duncan
that
would've
limited
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial
to
a
six-month
period.
of
course
the
constitution
was
defeated
as
a
matter
of
--
it
was
a
package
deal,
nothing
to
do,
i
don't
believe,
i'm
almost
certain
with
the
jury
trial
provision.
so
i
don't
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
saying
that
new
york
citizenry
does
not
view
a
one-year
sentence
as
a
serious
crime.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
this
dichotomy
has
existed,
it
was
--
the
history
of
new
york
entirely
until
1824
when
the
legislature
cutback
and
said
to
the
rest
of
the
state,
“we
will
provide
some
form
of
jury
trial.”
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
24,
it
was
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
the
one-year
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
its
curios,
now
let
me
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
interesting
that
in
1878,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
when
it
confronted
with
the
question
of
validity
of
that
choice,
we
no
longer
can
see
the
reason
for
denying
a
jury
trial
for
citizens
of
new
york.
of
course
now,
the
reasons
have
become
a
bit
more
sanguine
when
i
say,
the
city
has
grown
and
its
problems
have
become
so
immense,
but
in
1878
when
new
york
court
of
appeals
not
having,
not
feeling
itself
possessed
of
that
equal
protection
argument
just
declined
to
answer
the
question
on
constitutional
basis
although
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
they
commented
that
they
couldn't
see
the
distinction.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
and
there
have
constant
efforts
by
various
groups
to
have
it
you
know,
but
there's
nothing
pending
that
i
know
of
in
the
state
legislature.
the
people
have
attempted
to
draw
your
honors'
attention
in
their
brief,
i
think
that
superficially,
it
has
a
lot
of
attractiveness
but
i
think
down
deep,
it
really
doesn't
cut
too
deeply
by
trying
to
convince
you
that
one-year
as
cutoff
really
has
a
lot
of
sense,
a
lot
of
historical
sense
in
our
national
history.
but
the
one-year
cutoff
which
they
refer
to
really
is
a
felony-misdemeanor
distinction
that
goes
to
such
things
as
the
right
to
jury
trial
--
a
right
to
indictment
for
this
crime,
the
collateral
effect
of
the
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
distinguished
from
a
felony
and
the
place
of
incarceration
with
respect
to
the
both
of
them.
but
it's
interesting
that
this
one-year
distinction
that
they
attempt
to
draw
is
not
a
distinction
as
drawn
by
any
state
except
new
york
with
respect
to
the
right
to
jury
trial.
for
example,
california
still
draws
the
distinction
between
felony
and
misdemeanor
as
a
one-year
crime
in
terms
of
who
goes
to
what
prison,
but
with
respect
to
the
jury
trial,
a
common
law
jury
is
provided
in
california
for
traffic
offenses.
so
the
one-year
distinction
as
to
the
felony
and
misdemeanor
really
doesn't
answer
anything
and
combined
with
what
i
think
to
be
a
much
more
sensible
and
stronger
historical
six-month
position
really
wipes
itself
out.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
i
--
maybe
i
chose
the
wrong
word
mr.
chief
justice,
sensible
to
me
means
logically
consistent
with
your
prior
decisions
and
i
think
what
i'm
suggesting
here
is
logically
consistent
with
the
language
and
the
thrust
of
duncan.
the
commentators
who
have
analyzed
duncan
have
so
read
it
and
those
are
authorities
cited
in
our
brief.
i
think
since
duncan
looked
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
said,
“let
us
see
what
they
are
doing
in
the
other
states”
that
that
issue
was
resolved
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
hanging
was
the
new
york
situation.
the
right
to
--
also
to
attempt
to
tie
the
one-year
serious-petty
to
the
incidence
of
the
right
to
indictment
can't
work
very
well
either
because
only
eight
states
in
this
country
guarantee
the
right
to
indictment.
now
most
states
which
guarantee
the
right
to
jury
trial
which
was
set
forth
in
our
appendix
don't
really
care
about
indictment
and
i
would
presume
to
say
that
if
i
thought
there
was
one
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
would
probably
not
be
incorporated
apart
from
the
second
amendment
would
have
to
be
the
right
to
indictment.
scholarship,
the
literature
on
the
subject
is
against
grand
jury
indictment
rather
than
before
and
i
think
if
any
of
the
old
cases
perhaps
has
some
longevity,
it
would
be
hurtado.
also
the
place
of
confinement
in
that
22
states
as
adversary
recites,
“send
their
felons
to
state
prison
while
misdemeanants
go
to
county
jail.”
i
don't
think
there
was
any
analytical
words
your
honors.
mainly
because
its
only
22
states,
but
historically,
this
distinction
arises
out
of
concepts
of
infamy,
concepts
of
finance,
why
should
the
local
administration
have
to
bear
the
cost
of
a
serious
felon
where
the
state
could
take
a
more
proper
interest
and
indeed
in
new
york,
one
of
the
blunders
of
the
penal
law
even
with
its
recent
modification,
is
that
felons
can
go
to
the
county
jail
as
we
call
the
new
york
city
penitentiary.
this
is
something
the
legislature
would
like
to
resolve,
but
right
now,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
felons
do
go
to
rikers
island
which
is
the
penitentiary.
so
what
--
you
really
don't
as
i
see
it
get
much
mileage
out
of
the
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
by
the
people.
the
collateral
effect
are
also
time
tried
and
historical.
a
felon
loses
his
right
to
vote
in
most
states,
in
new
york,
right
to
public
office,
loss
of
civil
right
is
a
board
category.
the
misdemeanant,
all
he
loses
his
possible
right
to
livelihood,
housing,
employment,
certain
occupations.
the
majority
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
thought
this
were
not
very
important
compared
to
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
public
office.
i
think
given
the
nature
of
the
new
york
city
criminal
population,
those
people
who
faced
with
the
misdemeanor
conviction,
loss
of
the
misdemeanor
collateral
effect
--
collateral
consequences
are
much
more
severe
and
i
would
think
certainly
neutralized
the
court
of
appeals
emphasis
on
the
felony
collateral
effect.
i
think
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
case
in
terms
of
psychology
of
it
in
both
below
and
perhaps
here,
is
what
the
court
conceives
of
is
probably
new
york
city
criminal
court
here.
new
york
city
criminal
court
is
in
chaos
and
it
has
been
in
chaos
for
a
long
time
to
the
extent,
i
don't
know
how
i
could
convey
to
you
the
feeling
i
would
like
to
if
i
could
take
you
through
our
courthouses.
i've
tried
to
document
--
i
would
not
dare
make
the
claims
i
have
made
in
my
brief
without
documentation
of
what
it
is
like,
what
the
process
of
justice
has
become
in
our
criminal
court.
the
turnstile
feeling,
the
feeling
by
the
minority
population
which
participates
very
heavily
in
the
criminal
court
or
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
judge
to
being
a
part
and
watch
a
judge
decide
his
fifteenth
case
of
the
day.
the
jury
trial,
the
right
to
jury
trial
was
meant
i
think
by
this
court,
understood
by
this
court
to
protect
a
defendant
against
a
judge
for
whatever
the
reasons
maybe,
from
being
casehardened,
from
being
worn
down
by
the
system.
and
the
burdens
the
court
as
we've
pointed
out
with
the
addition
of
new
judges
as
we
assumed
the
elimination
of
three-judge
court
would
not
create
much
more
difficulty
if
any.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense
to
permit
new
york
to
stop
now
and
say
we
have
courtrooms
only
so
much
--
judges
only
so
much
and
we
think
we
have
enough
judges
for
this
and
also
one
of
the
significant
aspects
of
a
jury
trial
system
is
a
heavy
incidence
of
waiver
that
it
makes
any
sense
to
stop
or
permit
new
york
to
say
we
can
now
stop
the
1969
with
our
facilities.
i
think
new
york
is
capable
and
certainly
its
necessary
for
it
to
respond
to
what
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
requires
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it's
exceptionally
discretionary
your
honor.
it's
a
--
it's
really
titled
a
motion
to
remove
and
for
leave
to
prosecute
by
indictment
and
jury
trial,
the
law
on
that,
the
discretion
which
the
courts
have
exercised
isn't
such
an
arbitrary.
i
could
get
you
decisions
where
the
judges
themselves
say,
“we
have
no
guidance
on
this”
and
it
is
not
a
procedure
that
is
used
very
often.
just
briefly
then,
the
equal
protection
issue
we
think
is
a
bit
more
difficult
because
people
i
think
about
--
put
their
hand
on
one
possible
weakness
in
our
case
and
that
is,
if
we
are
right
on
the
sixth
amendment,
we're
begging
the
question
in
a
way
because
we've
got
the
constitutional
right.
we
don't
have
to
work
out
a
classification
problem.
although
i
would
suggest
that
if
for
some
reason,
i
can't
convince
you,
the
sixth
amendment
takes
us
where
we
would
like
it
that
even
without
having
the
sixth
amendment,
where
as
i
have
said
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
the
equal
protection
clause
--
where
the
state
does
provide
a
right
to
jury
trial,
that
right
by
its
mere
provision
as
this
court
interpreted
the
state's
practices
in
duncan
becomes
a
right
of
fundamental
importance
which
then
requires
a
rational
and
perhaps
a
compelling
interest
to
deny
a
citizen
within
a
state.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
only
have
three
matters
i
think
of.
mr.
juviler
has
tried
to
tell
you
that
congress
has
placed
a
different
emphasis
on
what
a
serious
--
i'm
not
quite
so
sure
that
--
it
was
justice
black
that
suggested
it's
relevant
but
even
if
it
were
relevant,
it's
not
quite
that
accurate
for
the
following
reasons.
in
duncan,
this
court
pointed
to
title
18,
section
1,
six-month
cutoff
and
said
in
a
way
indicia
of
duncan
by
it
be
whether
the
case
were
triable
in
the
federal
court.
that
title
1
still
remains,
still
stands
very
similar
to
the
new
york
penal
law,
the
new
york's
structure
of
the
penal
law
both
prior
to
the
revision
now.
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
mr.
juviler
speaks
off,
the
rights
of
it
has
not
changed
anything
at
all
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
a
right
to
jury
trial,
putting
aside
constitutional
considerations,
the
validity
of
the
magistrates
act
because
it
may
erase
problems
of
non-article
3
courts.
but
the
fact
is
that
even
under
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
has
the
new
classification,
you
are
still
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
for
anything
over
six
months.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
the
question
about
the
three-judge
court
and
the
demand
how
frequently
and
i
don't
know
if
its
proper
for
me
to
comment
on
this
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
but
if
--
as
member
of
the
bar
in
this
attorney
joint
legal
society,
i
feel
at
least
obligated
to
tell
the
court
that
in
the
hall
below,
the
criminal
court
system,
there
is
a
pressure
upon
defendants
not
to
seek
a
three-judge
court.
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
doesn't
--
to
turn
to
plea
bargain,
namely
what
the
defendant
give
up
with
respect
to
a
plea.
a
three-judge
court
is
not
a
highly
local
thing
among
the
people
who
must
work
with
the
court.
and
lastly,
i
would
only
point
out
that
in
frank,
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
for
the
court
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
even
though
there
was
a
three
year
provision,
it
was
only
six
months
whereas
in
new
york,
if
it
were
a
class
of
misdemeanor,
you
can
get
a
year
imprisonment
and
three
years
probation.
last
thing,
i
have
set
forth
in
appendix
b
a
break
down
of
the
criminal
code
of
the
penal
law
of
new
york
and
i
think
your
honors
will
see
if
you
were
even
curious
to
looking
to
the
nature
of
the
offense
rather
than
the
term
of
punishment
imposed
that
new
york
class
a
misdemeanor
does
not
strike
a
court
in
terms
of
the
petty
offenses
that
one
might
find
in
history.
you
will
find
the
concept
of
petty
offenses
historically
is
quite
a
stranger
to
the
class
of
misdemeanor
in
new
york.
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
city,
(inaudible)
which
is
comprised
is
the
only
jurisdiction
in
this
country
that
denies
to
its
citizens
a
right
to
jury
trial
for
a
crime
punishable
by
as
much
as
one-year
imprisonment.
indeed
in
the
remaining
57
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york,
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
of
six
requiring
unanimous
verdict.
thus
the
question
which
this
case
brings
to
this
court
whether
section
40
of
the
new
york
city
criminal
code
act
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief
violates
the
sixth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
in
the
fourteenth
in
denying
jury
trial
for
what
we
deem
to
be
a
serious
offense
and
also
in
view
of
the
provision
for
jury
trial
elsewhere
in
the
state
of
new
york
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
is
so
violated.
the
records
of
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
the
appellant
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
primarily
mr.
justice
harlan
in
that
the
state
of
new
york
making
available
to
all
its
residents
except
those
who
reside
in
the
city
of
new
york,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yeah.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
no
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
where
the
state
has
undertaken
to
provide
most
of
its
citizenry
apart
from
one
city
with
the
right
to
jury
trial
given
what
this
court
has
said
in
duncan
about
the
importance
of
right
to
jury
trial
as
provided
by
the
state.
indeed
in
the
deciding
duncan,
this
court
looked
to
the
states
to
see
how
important
that
right
was
and
they
found
that
it
was
applied
and
provided
for
in
all
the
states.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
well,
that
now
i
misunderstood
your
honor's
question.
if
that's
all
that's
involved
then
there
is
no
problem
there
because
if
new
york
is
the
only
state
which,
new
york
city
indeed,
was
the
only
state
which
has
a
problem
that
is
before
this
court
namely
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
a
year
then
we
don't
have
to
equalize
anything
among
the
other
states
because
this
court
has
already
decided
that
a
six-month
period
of
time
on
an
offense
is
petty
and
since
all
the
other
states
do
not
deprive
anybody
of
a
jury
trial
for
a
years
a
time
then
there
is
no
equalization
required
between
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
country.
there
is
equalization
required
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
state,
but
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
equal
protection
argument
a
bit
later.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
record
--
the
facts
were
essentially
very
simple.
this
defendant,
appellant
was
convicted
after
a
one-judge
bench
trial
for
the
crime
of
jostling
and
sentenced
to
one-year
imprisonment.
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
he
was
observed
with
his
co-defendant
crowding
a
woman
on
an
escalator
and
the
(inaudible)
terminal.
the
arresting
officer
said
that
he
saw
defendant
take
either
a
loose
cash,
money
from
the
woman's
handbag
or
a
$10
bill.
a
motion
for
a
jury
trial
was
made
in
the
criminal
court
and
it
was
denied.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
by
majority
decision,
five
to
two
felt
that
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
did
not
require
a
holding
that
one-year
was
a
serious
crime
nor
did
it
require
any
different
holding
on
equal
protection.
the
justices
who
dissented,
justice
burke
and
keating
took
a
much
different
view
and
of
course
it's
much
more
consonant
with
our
position.
essentially,
our
sixth
amendment
argument
is
really
broken
down
to
three
parts.
we
think
that
although
duncan
did
not
decide
this
question,
the
thrust
of
duncan,
the
logic
of
duncan
resolves
the
issue
for
us.
however,
we
also
feel
that
if
your
honors
would
accredit
new
york's
looking
at
its
own
historical
experience
to
deprive
the
appellant
of
a
jury
trial
that
even
under
what
we
concede
to
be
erroneous
criteria,
our
argument
still
prevails.
and
the
people
had
misunderstood
our
argument
on
this
point
because
they
seem
to
say
in
their
brief
that
we
offer
to
the
court
as
an
affirmative
indication
of
our
position.
we
are
saying
that
if
we
will
force
to
it,
we
can
win
our
case
even
under
the
criteria
of
new
york
court
of
appeals
followed,
even
though
we
think
its
broad.
thirdly,
i
think
perhaps
the
ghost
in
the
closet
on
this
case
has
to
be
the
question
of
the
impact
of
the
court's
decision
on
the
criminal
court,
the
problem
in
new
york
city
because
i
really
believe
if
this
case
had
come
from
casanovia,
or
people
--
as
the
people
would
have
it,
this
would
not
be
a
consideration.
now,
although
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
spoke
of
the
problems
of
new
york
criminal
court
on
the
equal
protection
issue,
i
can't
help
but
feel
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
grips
with
that,
end
of
the
argument
on
sixth
amendment
lurking
behind
the
problem
this
court
faces
is
the
problem
of
the
calendar
chaos
in
new
york
criminal
court.
hence,
looking
towards
the
decision
in
duncan,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
looked
to
what
it
called
the
objective
criteria,
chiefly
the
existing
laws
and
the
practices
of
the
nation
to
decide
whether
louisiana's
assault
statute
requiring
a
two
year
maximum
of
imprisonment
was
a
serious
or
petty
offense.
looking
to
national
criteria,
the
court
found
that
nowhere
else
in
the
land
was
a
two-year
of
sentence
of
countenance
without
a
right
to
jury
trial.
applying
that
method
of
analysis,
the
court
would
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
new
york
city,
namely
that
nowhere
else
in
the
land
does
the
situation
prevail
in
which
a
defendant
faced
with
one-year
imprisonment
is
denied
a
right
to
jury
trial.
so
section
4
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
you
are
getting
to
what
the
people
--
i
think
hang
their
case
on,
i
might
say,
namely
that
our
position
depends
on
whether
we
are
entitled
to
a
common
law
jury
or
not
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
error
for
the
same
reason
that
it
was
an
error
or
at
least
a
relevant
decision
in
duncan.
primarily
in
duncan,
the
court,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
bloom,
mr.
justice
white's
footnote,
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
all
discussed
whether
the
entire
bag
and
baggage
of
the
sixth
amendment
must
come
with
the
duncan
decision.
it's
a
question
left
opened
in
the
duncan.
the
unanimous
jury,
the
twelve-man
jury,
i
think
again
that
this
is
a
question
left
open
in
this
case
and
which
--
one
which
we
need
not
resolve
because
all
and
i
think
in
depending
on
duncan
that
we
are
asking
for
is
some
form
a
jury
trial.
for
instance
in
louisiana
after
duncan,
the
jury
trial
which
is
now
provided
is
not
a
common
law.
unanimous
jury,
is
a
five
man
jury
for
the
one-year
crime.
what
louisiana
did
is
they
knocked
a
lot
of
crime
down
to
six
months
and
for
the
ones
that
were
over,
they
provided
a
five
man
jury.
i
don't
think
the
record
in
this
case
nor
the
issue
on
this
case
has
to
depend
on
whether
a
sixth
amendment
jury
with
all
its
bag
and
baggage
is
required.
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
therefore
is
they
looked
away
from
duncan
and
at
least
read
duncan
to
authorize
looking
to
its
own
historical
experience,
namely
that
in
new
york
we
have
always
considered
a
misdemeanor
a
petty
offense
and
a
felony
a
serious
offense
and
that
one-year
decided
which
was
which?
but
the
six-months
cutoff
nation
with
--
nationwide
and
even
historically
has
much
more
support
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
jury
trial
than
does
the
one-year
cutoff
upon
which
the
people
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
based
their
opinion.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
i
think
your
honor,
it
would
preclude
the
state
from
denying
a
jury
trial
for
anything
more
than
a
six-month
period
of
imprisonment
unless
of
course
the
court
upon
reconsideration
of
a
decision,
it
could
be
forthcoming
in
this
case
and
in
duncan,
might
--
would
reconsider
on
a
full
record
what
the
problem
warrants.
i
think
that
its
interesting
in
the
people's
brief,
they
attempt
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
minnesota
experience
with
requiring
a
jury
trial
in
a
certain
lesser
crime
situations
by
showing
that
there
were
delays
that
will
result
in.
their
brief
doesn't
reflect
however
the
next
two
lines
of
the
minnesota
law
review
article
which
also
discloses
that
the
bar
association
of
minnesota
in
a
response
to
the
delay
and
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
should
remain
in
vivo,
recommend
it
that
it
was
much
more
important
to
retain
the
jury
system
than
to
just
disregard
it
as
a
result
of
some
momentary
shortage
of
space
and
the
facility
but
i'd
get
to
that
again
later.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
the
sixth
month
cutoff
has
historical
significance.
this
court
in
the
duncan
mentioned
the
fact
that
for
the
most
part
in
the
18th
century,
the
six-month
cutoff
with
exceptions
was
a
general
experience.
also,
the
reason
why
new
york's
experience
doesn't
really
help
is
that
new
york's
experience
was
not
the
only
type
of
experience
the
colonies
had
had.
new
york,
new
jersey
as
late
justice
frankfurter
in
his
article
--
mr.
cockrin
point
out
are
much
harsher
than
the
denial
of
trial
by
a
jury
than
many
of
the
other
colonies.
so
an
attempt
to
locate
in
history
exactly
what's
at
stake
is
not
really
a
fruitful
thing
but
i
think
we've
got
the
better
of
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
there
were
and
more
lenient,
there
were
more
lenient
policies
in
the
colony.
i
think
its
interesting
that
to
note
that
at
least
two
commentators,
professor
herbal
in
our
brief
think
that
the
new
york's
denial
of
jury
trial
in
serious
and
in
petty
offenses
or
serious
offenses
depending
on
where
you
place
the
label
has
something
to
do
with
the
aristocratic
structure
of
the
colony.
i
view
the
new
york
experience,
although
we
affirmed
consistently
over
the
years
by
the
court,
sort
of
a
vestige
of
this
old
colonial
policy.
the
dissenting
opinion
as
we
do
took
the
position
that
you
couldn't
tell
even
if
you
cannot
look
to
the
new
york
experience
that
the
citizens
of
new
york
had
not
opted,
had
not
felt
that
over
six
months
was
a
serious
offense.
for
the
reason
that
the
legislature
had
given
a
jury
trial
elsewhere
in
the
state
and
that
in
the
recent
constitutional
convention,
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
drafted
the
constitution
with
a
new
provision
which
this
court
called
attention
to
in
duncan
that
would've
limited
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial
to
a
six-month
period.
of
course
the
constitution
was
defeated
as
a
matter
of
--
it
was
a
package
deal,
nothing
to
do,
i
don't
believe,
i'm
almost
certain
with
the
jury
trial
provision.
so
i
don't
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
saying
that
new
york
citizenry
does
not
view
a
one-year
sentence
as
a
serious
crime.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
this
dichotomy
has
existed,
it
was
--
the
history
of
new
york
entirely
until
1824
when
the
legislature
cutback
and
said
to
the
rest
of
the
state,
“we
will
provide
some
form
of
jury
trial.”
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
24,
it
was
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
the
one-year
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
right.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
its
curios,
now
let
me
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
interesting
that
in
1878,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
when
it
confronted
with
the
question
of
validity
of
that
choice,
we
no
longer
can
see
the
reason
for
denying
a
jury
trial
for
citizens
of
new
york.
of
course
now,
the
reasons
have
become
a
bit
more
sanguine
when
i
say,
the
city
has
grown
and
its
problems
have
become
so
immense,
but
in
1878
when
new
york
court
of
appeals
not
having,
not
feeling
itself
possessed
of
that
equal
protection
argument
just
declined
to
answer
the
question
on
constitutional
basis
although
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
they
commented
that
they
couldn't
see
the
distinction.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
and
there
have
constant
efforts
by
various
groups
to
have
it
you
know,
but
there's
nothing
pending
that
i
know
of
in
the
state
legislature.
the
people
have
attempted
to
draw
your
honors'
attention
in
their
brief,
i
think
that
superficially,
it
has
a
lot
of
attractiveness
but
i
think
down
deep,
it
really
doesn't
cut
too
deeply
by
trying
to
convince
you
that
one-year
as
cutoff
really
has
a
lot
of
sense,
a
lot
of
historical
sense
in
our
national
history.
but
the
one-year
cutoff
which
they
refer
to
really
is
a
felony-misdemeanor
distinction
that
goes
to
such
things
as
the
right
to
jury
trial
--
a
right
to
indictment
for
this
crime,
the
collateral
effect
of
the
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
distinguished
from
a
felony
and
the
place
of
incarceration
with
respect
to
the
both
of
them.
but
it's
interesting
that
this
one-year
distinction
that
they
attempt
to
draw
is
not
a
distinction
as
drawn
by
any
state
except
new
york
with
respect
to
the
right
to
jury
trial.
for
example,
california
still
draws
the
distinction
between
felony
and
misdemeanor
as
a
one-year
crime
in
terms
of
who
goes
to
what
prison,
but
with
respect
to
the
jury
trial,
a
common
law
jury
is
provided
in
california
for
traffic
offenses.
so
the
one-year
distinction
as
to
the
felony
and
misdemeanor
really
doesn't
answer
anything
and
combined
with
what
i
think
to
be
a
much
more
sensible
and
stronger
historical
six-month
position
really
wipes
itself
out.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
no.
i
--
maybe
i
chose
the
wrong
word
mr.
chief
justice,
sensible
to
me
means
logically
consistent
with
your
prior
decisions
and
i
think
what
i'm
suggesting
here
is
logically
consistent
with
the
language
and
the
thrust
of
duncan.
the
commentators
who
have
analyzed
duncan
have
so
read
it
and
those
are
authorities
cited
in
our
brief.
i
think
since
duncan
looked
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
said,
“let
us
see
what
they
are
doing
in
the
other
states”
that
that
issue
was
resolved
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
hanging
was
the
new
york
situation.
the
right
to
--
also
to
attempt
to
tie
the
one-year
serious-petty
to
the
incidence
of
the
right
to
indictment
can't
work
very
well
either
because
only
eight
states
in
this
country
guarantee
the
right
to
indictment.
now
most
states
which
guarantee
the
right
to
jury
trial
which
was
set
forth
in
our
appendix
don't
really
care
about
indictment
and
i
would
presume
to
say
that
if
i
thought
there
was
one
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
would
probably
not
be
incorporated
apart
from
the
second
amendment
would
have
to
be
the
right
to
indictment.
scholarship,
the
literature
on
the
subject
is
against
grand
jury
indictment
rather
than
before
and
i
think
if
any
of
the
old
cases
perhaps
has
some
longevity,
it
would
be
hurtado.
also
the
place
of
confinement
in
that
22
states
as
adversary
recites,
“send
their
felons
to
state
prison
while
misdemeanants
go
to
county
jail.”
i
don't
think
there
was
any
analytical
words
your
honors.
mainly
because
its
only
22
states,
but
historically,
this
distinction
arises
out
of
concepts
of
infamy,
concepts
of
finance,
why
should
the
local
administration
have
to
bear
the
cost
of
a
serious
felon
where
the
state
could
take
a
more
proper
interest
and
indeed
in
new
york,
one
of
the
blunders
of
the
penal
law
even
with
its
recent
modification,
is
that
felons
can
go
to
the
county
jail
as
we
call
the
new
york
city
penitentiary.
this
is
something
the
legislature
would
like
to
resolve,
but
right
now,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
felons
do
go
to
rikers
island
which
is
the
penitentiary.
so
what
--
you
really
don't
as
i
see
it
get
much
mileage
out
of
the
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
by
the
people.
the
collateral
effect
are
also
time
tried
and
historical.
a
felon
loses
his
right
to
vote
in
most
states,
in
new
york,
right
to
public
office,
loss
of
civil
right
is
a
board
category.
the
misdemeanant,
all
he
loses
his
possible
right
to
livelihood,
housing,
employment,
certain
occupations.
the
majority
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
thought
this
were
not
very
important
compared
to
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
public
office.
i
think
given
the
nature
of
the
new
york
city
criminal
population,
those
people
who
faced
with
the
misdemeanor
conviction,
loss
of
the
misdemeanor
collateral
effect
--
collateral
consequences
are
much
more
severe
and
i
would
think
certainly
neutralized
the
court
of
appeals
emphasis
on
the
felony
collateral
effect.
i
think
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
case
in
terms
of
psychology
of
it
in
both
below
and
perhaps
here,
is
what
the
court
conceives
of
is
probably
new
york
city
criminal
court
here.
new
york
city
criminal
court
is
in
chaos
and
it
has
been
in
chaos
for
a
long
time
to
the
extent,
i
don't
know
how
i
could
convey
to
you
the
feeling
i
would
like
to
if
i
could
take
you
through
our
courthouses.
i've
tried
to
document
--
i
would
not
dare
make
the
claims
i
have
made
in
my
brief
without
documentation
of
what
it
is
like,
what
the
process
of
justice
has
become
in
our
criminal
court.
the
turnstile
feeling,
the
feeling
by
the
minority
population
which
participates
very
heavily
in
the
criminal
court
or
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
judge
to
being
a
part
and
watch
a
judge
decide
his
fifteenth
case
of
the
day.
the
jury
trial,
the
right
to
jury
trial
was
meant
i
think
by
this
court,
understood
by
this
court
to
protect
a
defendant
against
a
judge
for
whatever
the
reasons
maybe,
from
being
casehardened,
from
being
worn
down
by
the
system.
and
the
burdens
the
court
as
we've
pointed
out
with
the
addition
of
new
judges
as
we
assumed
the
elimination
of
three-judge
court
would
not
create
much
more
difficulty
if
any.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense
to
permit
new
york
to
stop
now
and
say
we
have
courtrooms
only
so
much
--
judges
only
so
much
and
we
think
we
have
enough
judges
for
this
and
also
one
of
the
significant
aspects
of
a
jury
trial
system
is
a
heavy
incidence
of
waiver
that
it
makes
any
sense
to
stop
or
permit
new
york
to
say
we
can
now
stop
the
1969
with
our
facilities.
i
think
new
york
is
capable
and
certainly
its
necessary
for
it
to
respond
to
what
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
requires
--
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
yes.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
it's
exceptionally
discretionary
your
honor.
it's
a
--
it's
really
titled
a
motion
to
remove
and
for
leave
to
prosecute
by
indictment
and
jury
trial,
the
law
on
that,
the
discretion
which
the
courts
have
exercised
isn't
such
an
arbitrary.
i
could
get
you
decisions
where
the
judges
themselves
say,
“we
have
no
guidance
on
this”
and
it
is
not
a
procedure
that
is
used
very
often.
just
briefly
then,
the
equal
protection
issue
we
think
is
a
bit
more
difficult
because
people
i
think
about
--
put
their
hand
on
one
possible
weakness
in
our
case
and
that
is,
if
we
are
right
on
the
sixth
amendment,
we're
begging
the
question
in
a
way
because
we've
got
the
constitutional
right.
we
don't
have
to
work
out
a
classification
problem.
although
i
would
suggest
that
if
for
some
reason,
i
can't
convince
you,
the
sixth
amendment
takes
us
where
we
would
like
it
that
even
without
having
the
sixth
amendment,
where
as
i
have
said
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
the
equal
protection
clause
--
where
the
state
does
provide
a
right
to
jury
trial,
that
right
by
its
mere
provision
as
this
court
interpreted
the
state's
practices
in
duncan
becomes
a
right
of
fundamental
importance
which
then
requires
a
rational
and
perhaps
a
compelling
interest
to
deny
a
citizen
within
a
state.
mr.
william
e.
hellerstein
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
only
have
three
matters
i
think
of.
mr.
juviler
has
tried
to
tell
you
that
congress
has
placed
a
different
emphasis
on
what
a
serious
--
i'm
not
quite
so
sure
that
--
it
was
justice
black
that
suggested
it's
relevant
but
even
if
it
were
relevant,
it's
not
quite
that
accurate
for
the
following
reasons.
in
duncan,
this
court
pointed
to
title
18,
section
1,
six-month
cutoff
and
said
in
a
way
indicia
of
duncan
by
it
be
whether
the
case
were
triable
in
the
federal
court.
that
title
1
still
remains,
still
stands
very
similar
to
the
new
york
penal
law,
the
new
york's
structure
of
the
penal
law
both
prior
to
the
revision
now.
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
mr.
juviler
speaks
off,
the
rights
of
it
has
not
changed
anything
at
all
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
a
right
to
jury
trial,
putting
aside
constitutional
considerations,
the
validity
of
the
magistrates
act
because
it
may
erase
problems
of
non-article
3
courts.
but
the
fact
is
that
even
under
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
has
the
new
classification,
you
are
still
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
for
anything
over
six
months.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
the
question
about
the
three-judge
court
and
the
demand
how
frequently
and
i
don't
know
if
its
proper
for
me
to
comment
on
this
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
but
if
--
as
member
of
the
bar
in
this
attorney
joint
legal
society,
i
feel
at
least
obligated
to
tell
the
court
that
in
the
hall
below,
the
criminal
court
system,
there
is
a
pressure
upon
defendants
not
to
seek
a
three-judge
court.
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
doesn't
--
to
turn
to
plea
bargain,
namely
what
the
defendant
give
up
with
respect
to
a
plea.
a
three-judge
court
is
not
a
highly
local
thing
among
the
people
who
must
work
with
the
court.
and
lastly,
i
would
only
point
out
that
in
frank,
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
for
the
court
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
even
though
there
was
a
three
year
provision,
it
was
only
six
months
whereas
in
new
york,
if
it
were
a
class
of
misdemeanor,
you
can
get
a
year
imprisonment
and
three
years
probation.
last
thing,
i
have
set
forth
in
appendix
b
a
break
down
of
the
criminal
code
of
the
penal
law
of
new
york
and
i
think
your
honors
will
see
if
you
were
even
curious
to
looking
to
the
nature
of
the
offense
rather
than
the
term
of
punishment
imposed
that
new
york
class
a
misdemeanor
does
not
strike
a
court
in
terms
of
the
petty
offenses
that
one
might
find
in
history.
you
will
find
the
concept
of
petty
offenses
historically
is
quite
a
stranger
to
the
class
of
misdemeanor
in
new
york.
thank
you.
