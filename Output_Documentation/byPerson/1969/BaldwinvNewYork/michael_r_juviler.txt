mr.
michael
r.
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
boundaries
of
the
petty
offense
category
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
duncan
against
louisiana
are
ill-defined
if
not
ambulatory.
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
to
define
those
boundaries.
a
subsidiary
question
raised
by
appellant's
claims
relates
to
the
alleged
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
the
geographical
classification
adopted
by
the
new
york
legislature.
i
propose
to
rest
entirely
or
almost
entirely
on
our
brief
as
to
that
issue,
although
i
might
perhaps
say
something
about
it
in
closing
tomorrow
morning.
the
difficult
question
which
the
court
left
open
in
duncan
as
to
the
boundaries
of
the
petty
offense
category
does
not
have
to
be
resolved
without
guidelines
for
indeed
there
have
been
substantial
guidelines
set
down
by
this
court.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
imprisonment
of
itself
does
not
render
an
offense
serious
such
as
to
require
trial
by
jury.
it
has
also
been
stated
unequivocally
that
an
offense
punishable
by
no
more
than
six
months
imprisonment
is
a
petty
offense.
on
the
other
hand,
a
crime
punishable
by
two
years
is
a
serious
offense,
that
was
the
holding
in
duncan.
so
we
have
essentially
in
this
case
a
choice
between
the
six-month
cutoff
proposed
by
appellant
and
the
one-year
cutoff
which
we
urge
upon
the
court.
there
is
a
temptation
in
choosing
between
these
alternatives
to
what
are
priority
judgment
to
say
while
this
is
serious
or
it
isn't,
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
but
there
are
extensive
indications,
there
are
extensive
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
experience
of
the
states
in
the
federal
system
of
justice
which
point
predominantly
to
the
one-year
cutoff
as
the
proper
boundary,
as
an
objective
boundary.
appellant
claims
that
new
york
city
in
provisions
for
jury
trials
stands
alone
in
the
entire
nation
in
withholding
trial
by
a
jury
from
offenses
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
but
it
is
not
that
clear
as
mr.
justice
harlan
implied
in
his
question
to
mr.
hellerstein,
there
are
juries
and
and
there
are
juries
and
since
the
issue
before
this
court
is
a
constitutional
issue
under
the
sixth
amendment,
we
would
best
look
to
the
constitutional
law
as
to
what
is
a
jury
trial.
that
is
a
jury
which
consists
of
twelve
persons
rendering
a
unanimous
verdict
at
a
trial
in
the
first
instance.
this
common
law,
sixth
amendment
jury
is
withheld
in
13
states
for
trials
of
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
thirteen
states
have
adopted
this
boundary
if
it
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
including
new
york
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
right
is
to
a
six-man
jury
in
all
of
other
counties
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
there
is
right
in
the
entire
state
to
a
common
law
sixth
amendment
jury.
and
thirteen
other
states
have
the
same
boundary
line
between
this
hybrid
jury
which
the
states
built
free
to
experiment
with
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
a
year
and
the
full
fledged
common
law
constitutional
jury
for
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
by
more
than
one-year.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes
there
are
for
example
9
states
in
which
there
are
fewer
than
twelve
jurors
for
crimes
punishable
explicitly
by
no
more
than
one-year,
that
is
the
explicit
cutoff
in
9
states.
in
one
state,
a
non-unanimous
verdict
can
be
rendered
in
a
case
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
as
the
precise
cutoff
and
in
five
states
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
with
a
jury
at
the
second
trial
for
persons
who
are
found
guilty
of
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
as
the
expressly
defined
cutoff.
if
you
add
this
all
together,
its
15,
but
they're
really
are
13
separate
states
because
some
of
the
states
have
adopted
several
of
these
hybrid
procedures.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
problem
is
that
three
judges
or
even
12
judges
are
not
a
jury.
they
are
not
citizens,
private
citizens
interposed
between
the
accused
and
the
government
and
we
do
not
urge
that
a
three-judge
bench
is
a
jury
of
three
persons.
we
concede
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
is
a
legislative
determination
in
new
york
which
is
based
on
a
long
standing
history
and
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
it
was
felt
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
adopting
a
system
which
had
no
jurors
at
all
there
might
be
a
ameliorating
factor
by
interposing
at
the
option
of
the
defendant
more
than
one
judge
so
that
you
could
have
deliberations
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no
question
and
it
would
be
even
more
with
a
jury
of
twelve.
but
the
question
here
is
what
the
constitution
requires
new
york
city
--
new
york
state
or
new
york
city
to
provide.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
are
five
states
which
provide
a
trial
only
de
novo
with
a
common
law
jury
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year,
that's
the
cutoff.
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
less
than
a
year
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
means
in
the
first
instance,
there
is
a
trial
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
without
any
jury
or
is
in
the
case
of
virginia
which
is
one
of
these
things,
there
are
five
jurors.
then
on
appeal
there
is
a
full
fledged
common
law
jury
of
twelve
for
persons
who
have
already
been
found
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
penalty
is
the
same,
punishment
by
up
to
one-year.
now
of
course
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
duncan,
these
procedures
are
subject
to
reconsideration
as
in
the
case
that
was
ordered
for
review
yesterday
from
florida
involving
six
jurors.
but
we
take
the
law
as
we
find
it
and
the
prosecution
can
also
find
solace
in
the
constitutional
law
as
we
find
it.
at
the
moment,
there
are
thirteen
states
which
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution
if
this
court
accepts
the
appellant's
argument
that
a
one-year
sentence
renders
a
crime
serious
under
the
sixth
amendment.
there
are
only
6
states
on
the
other
hand
which
have
adopted
a
six-month
cutoff
for
the
provision
for
a
jury
trial
of
any
kind
in
the
first
instance.
and
that
is
not
a
bulk
--
a
bulky
evidence
of
a
nationwide
feeling
of
seriousness
supporting
the
six
months
cutoff
which
appellant
proposes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
majority
of
states
provide
for
a
common
law
jury
at
various
levels
of
a
sentence.
for
example,
in
18
states,
including
california,
a
full
fledged
jury
trial
is
provided
for
any
crime
punishable
by
any
imprisonment
whatsoever,
but
since
the
choice
here
is
between
a
six-month
cutoff
and
a
one-year
cutoff,
these
provisions
in
18
states
which
go
far
beyond
what
is
required
by
the
constitution
offer
no
guidance
as
to
which
of
these
two
cutoffs
should
be
chosen
by
the
court.
california
has
made
clear
elsewhere
in
its
law
that
there
are
two
classes
of
crimes,
felonies
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
in
the
state
prison
or
penitentiary
and
misdemeanors
punishable
by
up
to
one-year,
one-year
in
the
county
jail
but
california
has
chosen
in
its
legislative
wisdom
to
apply
a
full
fledged
jury
trial
even
for
the
petty
offenses.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
we
list
a
quite
a
few
other
states
in
our
brief,
in
our
argument
and
in
our
appendix,
mr.
justice
white.
and
we
have
broken
them
down
by
the
specific
cutoff
shows
that
in
each
state,
there
are
18
states
with
a
six-month
cut
--
with
a
--
no
cutoff
whatsoever,
every
crime
is
triable
by
a
jury.
there
is
a
handful
of
states,
i
think
there
are
two
states
with
a
one
month
cutoff,
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one
month
have
a
jury
trial;
two
states
with
a
three-month
cutoff
and
only
six
with
the
six-month
cutoff
that
the
appellant
proposes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
under
the
common
understanding
of
the
sixth
amendment,
twelve
jurors
rendering
a
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
there
are
18
states
which
provide
such
a
jury
in
every
criminal
case
regardless
of
the
punishment.
there
are
two
states
in
the
three-month
cases,
two
states
in
two,
in
one-month
cases
and
only
six
states
in
six-month
cases.
we
do
not
hang
our
hats
on
the
jury
trial
provisions
that
i
have
discussed
contrary
to
the
appellant's
argument.
we
recognize
that
we're
dealing
here
with
circumstantial
evidence
of
seriousness
and
the
jury
trial
provisions
are
merely
one
source
of
guidance
to
this
court.
we
do
point
to
the
clear
law
relating
to
the
prosecution
of
infamous
crimes
under
the
fifth
amendment.
infamous
crimes
are
those
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary
or
at
hard
labor.
and
this
is
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
including
new
york
and
this
is
the
federal
system
of
justice
incorporated
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
this
is
clear
evidence
we
submit
as
to
the
content
of
serious
crimes
under
the
sixth
amendment,
particularly
since
both
provisions
in
the
bill
of
rights
serve
the
same
purpose
and
that
is
to
prevent
the
arbitrary
action
of
officials
of
the
government
that
mr.
hellerstein
has
referred
to,
to
protect
the
citizen
against
such
action
by
the
interposition
of
private
citizens
between
him
and
the
crowd.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
see
that
there
are
three
persons
brought
to
bear
on
the
complaint
against
a
defendant
with
their
deliberations
that
if
you
have
one
judge
who
has
a
disposition
for
or
against
the
defendant
or
a
certain
type
of
crime
that
will
be
ameliorated
by
two
other
finders
of
fact.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
would
estimate
in
approximately
5
to
10%
of
the
cases,
perhaps
5
to
10%
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
tried
brought
to
trial.
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
exercise
that
option.
there
is
a
broad
field
of
law
in
american
jurisprudence
pointing
further
to
the
one-year
cutoff
and
that
is
the
classification
of
crimes
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
the
federal
system
of
justice.
in
28
states,
and
in
federal
courts,
there
is
a
felony-misdemeanor
distinction
and
the
misdemeanors
are
punishable
by
no
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment.
now,
this
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case,
but
it
is
some
evidence
as
to
the
community's
view
in
the
nation
as
to
the
location
of
this
boundary
between
two
distinct
classes
of
crimes,
the
petty
offenses
and
the
serious
offenses.
there
are
other
expressions
of
seriousness
pointing
to
the
one-year
cutoff,
many
of
which
have
come
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
duncan
case,
many
of
which
have
been
effective
after
the
duncan
decision.
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
acts
provides
a
provision
for
eavesdropping
by
state
law
enforcement
officials
pursuant
to
court
order
and
one
of
the
categories
of
crimes
that
congress
has
authorized
to
be
the
subject
of
electronic
eavesdropping
is
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment,
not
six
months
of
imprisonment.
the
selection
of
petit
jurors
and
grand
jurors
for
federal
prosecutions
has
been
enacted
by
congress
after
duncan
to
exclude
and
disqualify
from
these
panels
persons
convicted
of
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
not
more
than
six
months.
these
are
the
serious
crimes
which
disqualify
american
citizens
from
sitting
on
a
grand
or
petit
jury
in
the
federal
system
of
justice.
the
uniform
criminal
extradition
act
which
has
been
adopted
in
45
states,
section
14
of
that
act
which
i've
neglected
to
cite
in
the
brief
adopts
also
a
one-year
cutoff,
not
a
six
year
cutoff
for
crimes
which
may
--
for
which
fugitives
may
be
apprehended
without
a
warrant.
if
he
is
a
fugitive
from
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
there
may
be
an
arrest
for
purposes
of
extradition
without
a
warrant.
now
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
is
considered
not
serious
enough
and
therefore
a
judge
has
to
issue
a
warrant.
now
this
again
is
an
item
of
circumstantial
evidence
guiding
this
court
in
choosing
between
the
six-month
boundary
and
the
one-year
boundary.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
excuse
me.
in
guiding
the
court
in
choosing
between
these
two
boundaries.
we
do
not
urge
that
this
issue
is
crystal
clear.
if
it
were,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
the
duncan
would've
disposed
of
it.
but
i
think
that
the
appellant
has
failed
to
point
to
any
considerable
body
of
evidence
leading
to
the
six-month
cutoff.
the
one-year
cutoff
is
the
predominant
one.
it
is
true
that
in
federal
contempt
cases,
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
this
supervisory
function
over
federal
justice
has
seized
upon
perhaps
out
of
desperation
the
six-month
cutoff
for
the
maximum
penalty
that
maybe
imposed
without
a
jury
and
the
court
was
guided
in
that
instance
by
section
1
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
which
define
petty
offenses
as
those
punishable
by
up
to
six
months.
but
congress,
since
those
decisions,
has
enacted
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
substantially
changes
the
congressional
view
of
seriousness
of
offenses
and
creates
a
new
offense,
the
minor
offense
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
and
it
removes
the
jurisdiction
of
such
minor
offenses
from
the
federal
district
court
to
the
federal
magistrate.
if
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
don't
think
it's
highly
relevant,
but
if
you
could
--
if
the
court
puts
all
of
these
provisions
together,
the
provisions
for
the
common
law
jury
in
cases
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
the
provisions
for
classification
of
crimes
that
i
have
recounted
to
the
court,
all
of
those
together
point
to
a
predominant
cutoff
of
one-year
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
a
community
sentiment
rather
than
a
judicial
sentiment
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
the
frank
case
in
the
last
term
of
this
court,
the
difficult
task
of
defining
serious
offenses
should
be
undertaken
without
regard
to
the
judicial
sentiment,
but
rather
with
regard
to
some
objective
criteria
as
to
how
the
national
community
views
crimes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
by
the
legislative
enactments
by
the
judicial
decisions
and
to
some
extent
by
the
history
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
various
states.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
they
not
only
rebut
mr.
chief
justice
the
appellant's
arguments
but
they
point
the
court
towards
the
one-year
cutoff
provision
because
this
is
the
real
choice,
is
it
going
to
be
six
months
or
is
it
going
to
be
one-year.
if
the
sentiment
were
the
answer,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
third
alternative
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
if
that
alternative
is
adopted
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
limits
on
the
state,
for
example
the
state
of
louisiana
chose
a
two-year
cutoff
and
that
was
deemed
to
be
impermissible
under
the
sixth
amendment.
but
the
state
we
urge
can
chose
a
cutoff
which
is
not
far
out
of
line
with
the
prevailing
standards
of
seriousness
and
the
one-year
cutoff
is
the
prevailing
standard,
the
six-month
cutoff
is
out
of
line.
the
other
alternative
is
to
say
that
in
every
criminal
case
as
two
members
of
the
court
have
said,
where
there
is
any
imprisonment
prescribed
whatever
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
because
as
to
him,
that
is
a
serious
offense.
but
the
court
has
reject
--
the
majority
of
the
court
has
consistently
rejected
that
approach
and
so
we
urge
that
guided
by
these
objective
criterion,
the
court,
he
simplest
and
most
substantially
based
decision
would
be
to
accept
the
one-year
--
accept
the
state
provision
providing
for
a
one-year
cutoff.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
boundaries
of
the
petty
offense
category
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
duncan
against
louisiana
are
ill-defined
if
not
ambulatory.
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
to
define
those
boundaries.
a
subsidiary
question
raised
by
appellant's
claims
relates
to
the
alleged
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
the
geographical
classification
adopted
by
the
new
york
legislature.
i
propose
to
rest
entirely
or
almost
entirely
on
our
brief
as
to
that
issue,
although
i
might
perhaps
say
something
about
it
in
closing
tomorrow
morning.
the
difficult
question
which
the
court
left
open
in
duncan
as
to
the
boundaries
of
the
petty
offense
category
does
not
have
to
be
resolved
without
guidelines
for
indeed
there
have
been
substantial
guidelines
set
down
by
this
court.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
imprisonment
of
itself
does
not
render
an
offense
serious
such
as
to
require
trial
by
jury.
it
has
also
been
stated
unequivocally
that
an
offense
punishable
by
no
more
than
six
months
imprisonment
is
a
petty
offense.
on
the
other
hand,
a
crime
punishable
by
two
years
is
a
serious
offense,
that
was
the
holding
in
duncan.
so
we
have
essentially
in
this
case
a
choice
between
the
six-month
cutoff
proposed
by
appellant
and
the
one-year
cutoff
which
we
urge
upon
the
court.
there
is
a
temptation
in
choosing
between
these
alternatives
to
what
are
priority
judgment
to
say
while
this
is
serious
or
it
isn't,
i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
but
there
are
extensive
indications,
there
are
extensive
circumstantial
evidence
in
the
experience
of
the
states
in
the
federal
system
of
justice
which
point
predominantly
to
the
one-year
cutoff
as
the
proper
boundary,
as
an
objective
boundary.
appellant
claims
that
new
york
city
in
provisions
for
jury
trials
stands
alone
in
the
entire
nation
in
withholding
trial
by
a
jury
from
offenses
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
but
it
is
not
that
clear
as
mr.
justice
harlan
implied
in
his
question
to
mr.
hellerstein,
there
are
juries
and
and
there
are
juries
and
since
the
issue
before
this
court
is
a
constitutional
issue
under
the
sixth
amendment,
we
would
best
look
to
the
constitutional
law
as
to
what
is
a
jury
trial.
that
is
a
jury
which
consists
of
twelve
persons
rendering
a
unanimous
verdict
at
a
trial
in
the
first
instance.
this
common
law,
sixth
amendment
jury
is
withheld
in
13
states
for
trials
of
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
thirteen
states
have
adopted
this
boundary
if
it
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
including
new
york
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
right
is
to
a
six-man
jury
in
all
of
other
counties
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year.
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
there
is
right
in
the
entire
state
to
a
common
law
sixth
amendment
jury.
and
thirteen
other
states
have
the
same
boundary
line
between
this
hybrid
jury
which
the
states
built
free
to
experiment
with
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
a
year
and
the
full
fledged
common
law
constitutional
jury
for
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
by
more
than
one-year.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes
there
are
for
example
9
states
in
which
there
are
fewer
than
twelve
jurors
for
crimes
punishable
explicitly
by
no
more
than
one-year,
that
is
the
explicit
cutoff
in
9
states.
in
one
state,
a
non-unanimous
verdict
can
be
rendered
in
a
case
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
as
the
precise
cutoff
and
in
five
states
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
with
a
jury
at
the
second
trial
for
persons
who
are
found
guilty
of
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
as
the
expressly
defined
cutoff.
if
you
add
this
all
together,
its
15,
but
they're
really
are
13
separate
states
because
some
of
the
states
have
adopted
several
of
these
hybrid
procedures.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
problem
is
that
three
judges
or
even
12
judges
are
not
a
jury.
they
are
not
citizens,
private
citizens
interposed
between
the
accused
and
the
government
and
we
do
not
urge
that
a
three-judge
bench
is
a
jury
of
three
persons.
we
concede
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
is
a
legislative
determination
in
new
york
which
is
based
on
a
long
standing
history
and
the
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
it
was
felt
mr.
justice
marshall
that
in
adopting
a
system
which
had
no
jurors
at
all
there
might
be
a
ameliorating
factor
by
interposing
at
the
option
of
the
defendant
more
than
one
judge
so
that
you
could
have
deliberations
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no
question
and
it
would
be
even
more
with
a
jury
of
twelve.
but
the
question
here
is
what
the
constitution
requires
new
york
city
--
new
york
state
or
new
york
city
to
provide.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
there
are
five
states
which
provide
a
trial
only
de
novo
with
a
common
law
jury
for
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
one-year,
that's
the
cutoff.
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
less
than
a
year
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
that
means
in
the
first
instance,
there
is
a
trial
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
without
any
jury
or
is
in
the
case
of
virginia
which
is
one
of
these
things,
there
are
five
jurors.
then
on
appeal
there
is
a
full
fledged
common
law
jury
of
twelve
for
persons
who
have
already
been
found
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
penalty
is
the
same,
punishment
by
up
to
one-year.
now
of
course
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
duncan,
these
procedures
are
subject
to
reconsideration
as
in
the
case
that
was
ordered
for
review
yesterday
from
florida
involving
six
jurors.
but
we
take
the
law
as
we
find
it
and
the
prosecution
can
also
find
solace
in
the
constitutional
law
as
we
find
it.
at
the
moment,
there
are
thirteen
states
which
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution
if
this
court
accepts
the
appellant's
argument
that
a
one-year
sentence
renders
a
crime
serious
under
the
sixth
amendment.
there
are
only
6
states
on
the
other
hand
which
have
adopted
a
six-month
cutoff
for
the
provision
for
a
jury
trial
of
any
kind
in
the
first
instance.
and
that
is
not
a
bulk
--
a
bulky
evidence
of
a
nationwide
feeling
of
seriousness
supporting
the
six
months
cutoff
which
appellant
proposes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
majority
of
states
provide
for
a
common
law
jury
at
various
levels
of
a
sentence.
for
example,
in
18
states,
including
california,
a
full
fledged
jury
trial
is
provided
for
any
crime
punishable
by
any
imprisonment
whatsoever,
but
since
the
choice
here
is
between
a
six-month
cutoff
and
a
one-year
cutoff,
these
provisions
in
18
states
which
go
far
beyond
what
is
required
by
the
constitution
offer
no
guidance
as
to
which
of
these
two
cutoffs
should
be
chosen
by
the
court.
california
has
made
clear
elsewhere
in
its
law
that
there
are
two
classes
of
crimes,
felonies
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
in
the
state
prison
or
penitentiary
and
misdemeanors
punishable
by
up
to
one-year,
one-year
in
the
county
jail
but
california
has
chosen
in
its
legislative
wisdom
to
apply
a
full
fledged
jury
trial
even
for
the
petty
offenses.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
we
list
a
quite
a
few
other
states
in
our
brief,
in
our
argument
and
in
our
appendix,
mr.
justice
white.
and
we
have
broken
them
down
by
the
specific
cutoff
shows
that
in
each
state,
there
are
18
states
with
a
six-month
cut
--
with
a
--
no
cutoff
whatsoever,
every
crime
is
triable
by
a
jury.
there
is
a
handful
of
states,
i
think
there
are
two
states
with
a
one
month
cutoff,
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one
month
have
a
jury
trial;
two
states
with
a
three-month
cutoff
and
only
six
with
the
six-month
cutoff
that
the
appellant
proposes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
under
the
common
understanding
of
the
sixth
amendment,
twelve
jurors
rendering
a
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
well,
there
are
18
states
which
provide
such
a
jury
in
every
criminal
case
regardless
of
the
punishment.
there
are
two
states
in
the
three-month
cases,
two
states
in
two,
in
one-month
cases
and
only
six
states
in
six-month
cases.
we
do
not
hang
our
hats
on
the
jury
trial
provisions
that
i
have
discussed
contrary
to
the
appellant's
argument.
we
recognize
that
we're
dealing
here
with
circumstantial
evidence
of
seriousness
and
the
jury
trial
provisions
are
merely
one
source
of
guidance
to
this
court.
we
do
point
to
the
clear
law
relating
to
the
prosecution
of
infamous
crimes
under
the
fifth
amendment.
infamous
crimes
are
those
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment
in
the
state
penitentiary
or
at
hard
labor.
and
this
is
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
including
new
york
and
this
is
the
federal
system
of
justice
incorporated
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
this
is
clear
evidence
we
submit
as
to
the
content
of
serious
crimes
under
the
sixth
amendment,
particularly
since
both
provisions
in
the
bill
of
rights
serve
the
same
purpose
and
that
is
to
prevent
the
arbitrary
action
of
officials
of
the
government
that
mr.
hellerstein
has
referred
to,
to
protect
the
citizen
against
such
action
by
the
interposition
of
private
citizens
between
him
and
the
crowd.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
yes.
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
see
that
there
are
three
persons
brought
to
bear
on
the
complaint
against
a
defendant
with
their
deliberations
that
if
you
have
one
judge
who
has
a
disposition
for
or
against
the
defendant
or
a
certain
type
of
crime
that
will
be
ameliorated
by
two
other
finders
of
fact.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
would
estimate
in
approximately
5
to
10%
of
the
cases,
perhaps
5
to
10%
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
tried
brought
to
trial.
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
exercise
that
option.
there
is
a
broad
field
of
law
in
american
jurisprudence
pointing
further
to
the
one-year
cutoff
and
that
is
the
classification
of
crimes
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
the
federal
system
of
justice.
in
28
states,
and
in
federal
courts,
there
is
a
felony-misdemeanor
distinction
and
the
misdemeanors
are
punishable
by
no
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment.
now,
this
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case,
but
it
is
some
evidence
as
to
the
community's
view
in
the
nation
as
to
the
location
of
this
boundary
between
two
distinct
classes
of
crimes,
the
petty
offenses
and
the
serious
offenses.
there
are
other
expressions
of
seriousness
pointing
to
the
one-year
cutoff,
many
of
which
have
come
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
duncan
case,
many
of
which
have
been
effective
after
the
duncan
decision.
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
acts
provides
a
provision
for
eavesdropping
by
state
law
enforcement
officials
pursuant
to
court
order
and
one
of
the
categories
of
crimes
that
congress
has
authorized
to
be
the
subject
of
electronic
eavesdropping
is
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year
of
imprisonment,
not
six
months
of
imprisonment.
the
selection
of
petit
jurors
and
grand
jurors
for
federal
prosecutions
has
been
enacted
by
congress
after
duncan
to
exclude
and
disqualify
from
these
panels
persons
convicted
of
crimes
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
not
more
than
six
months.
these
are
the
serious
crimes
which
disqualify
american
citizens
from
sitting
on
a
grand
or
petit
jury
in
the
federal
system
of
justice.
the
uniform
criminal
extradition
act
which
has
been
adopted
in
45
states,
section
14
of
that
act
which
i've
neglected
to
cite
in
the
brief
adopts
also
a
one-year
cutoff,
not
a
six
year
cutoff
for
crimes
which
may
--
for
which
fugitives
may
be
apprehended
without
a
warrant.
if
he
is
a
fugitive
from
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
there
may
be
an
arrest
for
purposes
of
extradition
without
a
warrant.
now
if
the
crime
is
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
is
considered
not
serious
enough
and
therefore
a
judge
has
to
issue
a
warrant.
now
this
again
is
an
item
of
circumstantial
evidence
guiding
this
court
in
choosing
between
the
six-month
boundary
and
the
one-year
boundary.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
excuse
me.
in
guiding
the
court
in
choosing
between
these
two
boundaries.
we
do
not
urge
that
this
issue
is
crystal
clear.
if
it
were,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
the
duncan
would've
disposed
of
it.
but
i
think
that
the
appellant
has
failed
to
point
to
any
considerable
body
of
evidence
leading
to
the
six-month
cutoff.
the
one-year
cutoff
is
the
predominant
one.
it
is
true
that
in
federal
contempt
cases,
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
this
supervisory
function
over
federal
justice
has
seized
upon
perhaps
out
of
desperation
the
six-month
cutoff
for
the
maximum
penalty
that
maybe
imposed
without
a
jury
and
the
court
was
guided
in
that
instance
by
section
1
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
which
define
petty
offenses
as
those
punishable
by
up
to
six
months.
but
congress,
since
those
decisions,
has
enacted
the
federal
magistrates
act
which
substantially
changes
the
congressional
view
of
seriousness
of
offenses
and
creates
a
new
offense,
the
minor
offense
punishable
by
up
to
one-year
and
it
removes
the
jurisdiction
of
such
minor
offenses
from
the
federal
district
court
to
the
federal
magistrate.
if
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
no.
i
don't
think
it's
highly
relevant,
but
if
you
could
--
if
the
court
puts
all
of
these
provisions
together,
the
provisions
for
the
common
law
jury
in
cases
punishable
by
more
than
one-year,
the
provisions
for
classification
of
crimes
that
i
have
recounted
to
the
court,
all
of
those
together
point
to
a
predominant
cutoff
of
one-year
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
a
community
sentiment
rather
than
a
judicial
sentiment
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
the
frank
case
in
the
last
term
of
this
court,
the
difficult
task
of
defining
serious
offenses
should
be
undertaken
without
regard
to
the
judicial
sentiment,
but
rather
with
regard
to
some
objective
criteria
as
to
how
the
national
community
views
crimes.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
by
the
legislative
enactments
by
the
judicial
decisions
and
to
some
extent
by
the
history
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
various
states.
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
i
think
that
they
not
only
rebut
mr.
chief
justice
the
appellant's
arguments
but
they
point
the
court
towards
the
one-year
cutoff
provision
because
this
is
the
real
choice,
is
it
going
to
be
six
months
or
is
it
going
to
be
one-year.
if
the
sentiment
were
the
answer,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
the
third
alternative
--
mr.
michael
r.
juviler
if
that
alternative
is
adopted
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
limits
on
the
state,
for
example
the
state
of
louisiana
chose
a
two-year
cutoff
and
that
was
deemed
to
be
impermissible
under
the
sixth
amendment.
but
the
state
we
urge
can
chose
a
cutoff
which
is
not
far
out
of
line
with
the
prevailing
standards
of
seriousness
and
the
one-year
cutoff
is
the
prevailing
standard,
the
six-month
cutoff
is
out
of
line.
the
other
alternative
is
to
say
that
in
every
criminal
case
as
two
members
of
the
court
have
said,
where
there
is
any
imprisonment
prescribed
whatever
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
because
as
to
him,
that
is
a
serious
offense.
but
the
court
has
reject
--
the
majority
of
the
court
has
consistently
rejected
that
approach
and
so
we
urge
that
guided
by
these
objective
criterion,
the
court,
he
simplest
and
most
substantially
based
decision
would
be
to
accept
the
one-year
--
accept
the
state
provision
providing
for
a
one-year
cutoff.
