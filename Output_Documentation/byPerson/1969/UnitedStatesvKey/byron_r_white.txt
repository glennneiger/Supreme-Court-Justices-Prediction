justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
this
was
basically
a
liquidation
plan
and
not
a
continuing?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
were
the
installment
payments
going
to
be
generated?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
the
capital
equipment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
should
contend
or
3466
gives
you
a
priority,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
contend
that's
applicable
in
this
case
but
so
does
the
bankruptcy
act
give
priorities.
under
chapter
x,
there's
certain
creditors
who
have
priority
just
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
aren’t
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
administrative
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
creditors
in
chapter
x?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
relied
on
the
cases
on
strict
priority
--
strict
priority
doctrine
that
you
have
to
pay
--
that
you
really
have
satisfy
priority
creditors
like
the
case
against
los
angeles?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
wouldn’t
suggest
to
that
--
you
really
wouldn’t
suggest
to
the
secured
creditor
does
not
have
some
priority
to
chapter
x,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
let's
take
mortgagees
then.
you
say
they
have
priority
in
the
chapter
x?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let's
take
a
mortgagee
priority
over
unsecured
creditors,
would
you
suggest
that
the
mortgagee
may
not
be
postponed
in
payment
to
unsecured
creditors
who
say
have
been
scaled
down
to
25%
of
their
claim?
let's
assume
the
plan
calls
for
satisfying
the
secured
debt
over
a
period
of
10-year.
but
unsecured
creditors
are
paid
off
after
when
you
value
the
property
and
you
find
out
what
interest
the
unsecured
creditors
have,
you
find
out
the
only
assets
that
are
left
for
them
are
25%.
25%
of
their
claims
are
going
to
be
paid
and
they
have
to
cash
to
pay
you
and
they
decide
just
to
get
rid
of
it
and
they
pay
him
off
in
cash
in
the
plan
but
secured
creditors
who
are
going
to
be
paid
in
full
are
postponed
for
10
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
essential
for
your
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
although
you
say
that
give
this
priority.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
can
object
to
the
plan
but
then
the
question
is
what
provisional
will
be
made
for
none
dissenting
creditors
and
whether
it’s
fair
and
equitable
to
do
that
but
you
don’t
claim
it.
do
you
think
3466
gives
you
some
kind
of
a
priority
that’s
different
from
other
priority
creditors?
assuming
it’s
applicable
to
this
case
it
does
give
you
a
priority.
but
is
there
any
different
priority
than
a
secured
creditor
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
if
you
really
do
then
find
it
essential
to
rely
on
3466
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
that
point
so
you
aren’t
just
relying
on
being
a
priority
creditor
under
chapter
x
or
relying
of
being
a
priority
creditor
under
the
other
section
3466.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
cases
have
certainly
adjudicated
a
whole
system
of
priorities
in
chapter
x,
aren’t
they?
they
may
not
be
set
out
in
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
cases
have
certainly
adjudicated
including
administrative
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
nobody
is
contesting
that
you
have
a
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
compensating
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
unsecured
creditors
were
to
get
only
20%
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
their
claims
or
20%
reduction
of
their
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
total?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
a
--
it’s
still
of
reorganization
plan
even
though
it
provides
for
complete
liquidation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
judged
by
the
rules
of
chapter
x
of
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
should
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
think
the
united
--
that
a
plan
reorganization
could
take
this
particular
claim
of
the
united
states
and
provide
that
it
be
paid
in
full
10
years
from
the
date
of
conformation
of
the
plan.
no
payments
prior
to
that
time
and
all
other
unsecured
creditors
are
paid
in
full
at
the
time
of
conformation?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
then
that
fair
--
that
fairness
and
equitable
--
fair
and
equity
applied
to
be
fair
and
equitable
and
not
really
recognized
in
full
or
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
available
cash
it’s
paid
to
junior
creditors
and
not
paid
to
a
senior
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
the
first
distribution
there
is
$18,000.00
paid
to
--
for
miscellaneous
taxes
and
$14,000.00
paid
for
another
tax
claim
and
certain
damages
for
cargo
loss.
they
have
larger
amounts
of
money
are
paid
out
that
are
available
and
not
paid
to
the
senior
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
priority
in
the
statute
for
ohio
use
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
united
states
tax
claims
is
senior
to
this
ohio
use
tax
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
this
in
chapter
x?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you're
--
you're
really
saying
that
the
priority
rules
and
the
rules
of
reorganization
shouldn’t
apply
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
whether
they're
entitled
to
cash
payment
may
not
be
the
question
is
whether
they're
entitled
to
payment
before
a
junior
creditor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
united
states
a
senior
creditor
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
take
that
position
i
--
by
thinking
the
way
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
a
senior
creditor
may
be
postponed
in
payment
for
10
years
as
long
as
he's
assured
--
he’s
being
paid
but
junior
creditors
can
be
paid
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
take
the
case
where
a
senior
creditor
is
provided
for
in
the
plan
by
a
promise
and
security
that
he'll
be
paid
for
full
10
years
in
the
date
of
conformation
of
the
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
junior
creditors
are
paid
in
full
in
cash
upon
the
date
of
conformation?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
senior
creditor
doesn’t
question
in
my
example
the
fact
that
he
will
be
paid
in
10
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
agree,
all
will
be
paid,
there's
plenty
of
security
there
but
he
says,
i
want
my
money
now
before
these
junior
creditors
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
you
have
to
take
that
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
rather
begs
the
question,
doesn’t
it?
i
mean,
that
you
assume
as
the
result
must
be
exactly
the
same
in
chapter

is
it
isn’t
straight

and
that
is
the

white
you
say
this
was

where
were

just
by

what
about

white
either
--
justice
byron

white
what
about
your
creditors
in

justice

i
thought
you
relied

on

to
the

does
not
have
some

to

would
you?
justice

let's
take
mortgagees
then.
you

they
have

in
the
chapter

alright,
let's
take

to
