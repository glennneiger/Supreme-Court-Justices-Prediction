mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
concerned
with
the
single
aspect
of
the
proceedings
under
a
voluntary
petition
for
corporate
reorganization
originally
filed
in
1954
pursuant
to
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
law
by
the
debtor,
hancock
trucking
incorporated.
in
the
petition,
hancock
alleged
that
it
was
unable
to
meet
its
debts
as
they
became
due
and
requested
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
to
operate
its
business
and
manage
its
property.
the
respondent
here
is
that
trustee.
the
claims
of
the
united
states
against
the
debtor
are
for
unpaid
income
withholding,
employment
and
excise
taxes
in
the
total
amount
of
more
than
$375,000.00.
because
of
the
narrow
focus
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
government's
petition
for
a
certiorari,
little
of
the
lengthy
history
of
these
reorganization
proceedings
need
be
recounted
here.
the
issues
in
this
court
concerned
an
amended
plan
of
reorganization
filed
by
the
trustee
in
june
1967
and
approved
by
the
courts
below
over
the
government's
objection.
the
amended
plan
reflected
in
agreement
approved
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
sale
of
the
debtors
principle
asset,
its
interstate
commerce
commission
operating
rights
for
truck
freight
services
to
hennis
freight
lines
incorporated.
the
purchase
price
of
$935,000.00
was
to
be
paid
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
requiring
$300,000.00
to
be
paid
within
90
days
of
the
commission’s
approval
of
the
sale
and
the
balance
in
78
monthly
installments.
the
amended
reorganization
plan
reflecting
this
sale
agreement
did
not
contemplate
that
the
debtor
hancock
trucking
would
continue
to
exist.
the
amended
plan
is
in
effect
a
liquidation
plan.
the
government
made
no
objection
to
the
terms
of
the
sale
agreement,
its
objections
relates
solely
to
the
provisions
for
payment
to
creditors
in
the
amended
reorganization
plan.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
payments
being
made
by
hennis
trucking
company
which
has
purchased
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rights
to
operate
the
freight
line.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
the
capital
equipment
had
previously
been
disposed
off.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
major
remaining
asset
was
simply
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
license.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
be
entitled
to
object
to
it
but
the
secretary
also
would
have
had
discretion
to
accept
for
the
plan
if
he
wishes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
does
sir
specially
when
it
will
contribute
to
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
and
enable
the
debtor
to
continue
in
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
contends
that
the
provisions
for
payment
of
creditors
in
the
amended
plan
do
not
satisfy
its
statutory
priority
of
payment
rights
and
the
respondent
trustee
admits
in
its
brief
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
priority
but
contends
that
its
rights
are
fully
satisfied
under
the
plan
and
that
is
the
issue
is
this
court.
the
contested
plan
provides
for
an
initial
payment
of
100%
of
certain
wage
claims
and
certain
state
and
local
tax
claims.
20%
of
the
claims
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
which
is
all
they
will
receive
and
10%
of
the
government’s
tax
claims
and
of
the
remaining
state
and
local
tax
claims.
the
remainder
of
the
amount
due
to
the
government
and
to
state
and
local
tax
authorities
was
to
be
paid
in
78
monthly
installments
secured
by
an
assignment
of
the
note
and
chattel
mortgage
hennis
had
executed
on
its
purchase
of
the
debtor’s
operating
rights.
this
amounts
to
an
initial
payment
on
the
government’s
total
claim
of
some
$375,400.00
of
approximately
$37,500.00
and
78
equal
monthly
installments
thereafter
of
approximately
$4,330.00
each.
no
interest
was
to
be
paid
on
the
monthly
installments
which
together
with
the
initial
payment
would
simply
total
the
$375,400.00
owing
to
the
government.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
at
the
time
of
the
initial
payment
when
lower
ranking
creditors
were
to
be
paid
in
cash
the
discounted
present
value
of
the
right
to
these
future
payments
to
the
government
plus
the
initial
payment
to
the
government
would
amount
to
approximately
$317,000.00,
some
$58,400.00
less
than
the
$375,400.00
owing
to
the
government.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
does
not
satisfy
its
priority
rights
not
because
the
government
has
a
right
to
immediate
payment
of
all
cash
that
is
on
hand
up
to
the
limit
of
its
claim
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding
which
we
do
not
urged
and
not
because
the
government
has
a
right
to
the
payment
of
interest
for
any
part
of
the
post
petition
period
preceding
cash
payment
to
lower
ranking
creditors.
we
recognize
that
there
isn't
a
right
to
such
interest
on
the
government’s
claims.
our
contention
is
simply
that
the
government
as
a
priority
creditor
cannot
be
required
at
the
time
when
non-priority
creditors
are
being
paid
in
cash
to
accept
iou's
payable
only
in
the
future
the
part
of
its
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
(voice
overlap)
it's
admitted
that
we're
entitled
to
full
payment.
the
issue
is
when?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
meant
to
say
it's
admitted
by
the
respondent
that
they
were
entitled
to
full
payment.
that
is
the
issue
between
us.
of
course
we
contend
is
that
what
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
alternative
contention
that
we
have
a
right
to
take
the
discounting
into
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
also
contend
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
first
satisfied
under
section
3466
of
the
revised
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
i
just
said
was
in
chapter
x
proceedings.
we
do
not
claim
a
right
to
the
immediate
disbursement
of
cash
that
is
not
being
paid
to
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
claim
that
because
cash
is
on
hand
and
we
are
creditor
we
have
a
right
to
the
immediate
payment
of
our
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
when
cash
is
being
paid
to
creditors,
we
claim
the
right
to
be
satisfied
first.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
limit
of
what's
being
paid
to
creditors,
yes
mr.
justice.
we
claim
a
right
to
be
paid
to
ahead
of
nonpriority
creditors
when
payments
are
being
made
to
creditors.
we
do
not
claim
a
right
to
insist
that
the
payments
be
made
when
other
uses
are
being
made
of
the
money
that
the
trustee
holds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
general
priority
provision
in
chapter
x
mr.
justice,
the
only
comprehensive
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
provision
for
administrative
expenses.
it’s
the
only
other
provision
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
wage
priority
in
chapter
x.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
wage
priority
in
section
64
of
the
act
which
by
section
102
of
the
act
is
expressly
inapplicable
to
chapter
x.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
granting
them
priority
in
chapter
x,
but
there
has
been
lengthy
litigation
about
whether
they
have
a
priority
ahead
of
the
3466
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
contend
that
you
have
to
abide
by
the
classes
of
priority
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
it’s
been
held
in
equity
reorganization
equity
receivership
proceedings
that
secured
creditors
at
least
the
mortgagees
have
priority
ahead
of
the
government’s
priority
under
3466.
there
has
been
disagreement
about
other
secured
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
the
standards
of
priority
that
prevail
in
equity
receiverships
have
been
carried
over
into
chapter
x,
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
understanding
of
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
is
that
if
the
secured
creditors
object
to
that,
they
have
a
right
to
insist
on
their
payments
being
made
first,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
not
essential
for
your
case
mr.
justice
because
we
have
a
statutory
right
and
revised
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
moreover,
we
have
an
explicit
right
in
section
199
in
chapter
x
to
object
to
the
plan
if
it
doesn’t
satisfy
our
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it’s
more
explicit
that
it’s
a
right
to
have
our
claim
first
satisfied
that’s
the
language
used
in
section
3466
where
there’s
no
explicit
statutory
language
giving
the
secured
creditors
such
a
right.
they
will
have
to
draw
their
rights
from
the
judicial
interpretations
of
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
and
equity
receivership
proceedings
and
their
arguably
would
be
more
leeway
for
the
courts
to
consider
making
exceptions
to
some
of
the
rules
that
have
been
established
in
those
proceedings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
essential
because
we
don’t
think
we
received
the
full
payment
right
granted
in
section
199
since
the
discounting
of
our
claims
was
never
taken
into
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
also
rely
on
the
idea
that
chapter
x
grants
two
priorities
only.
there
are
only
two
explicit
priorities
in
chapter
x
and
i'll
turn
into
that
right
now.
one
of
them
is
reproduced
on
section
43
of
our
brief
and
that
is
section
216,
number
three
--
subsection
3
a
plan
oft
reorganization
under
this
chapter
shall
provide
for
the
payment
of
all
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
and
other
allowances
which
may
be
approved
or
made
by
the
judge.
that
is
the
only
statutory
basis
for
the
priority
for
administrative
expenses
in
chapter
x.
if
the
terminology
used
is
the
same
terminology
used
for
the
government’s
tax
claim
priority
that
the
plan
of
the
right
is
to
have
the
plan
provide
for
the
payment.
and
we
believe
that
section
199
which
is
the
provision
in
section
--
in
chapter
x
which
gives
us
our
priority
rights
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
followed
in
that
chapter
also
in
body
a
notion
of
priority.
everyone
has
assumed
and
tried
along
in
the
administration
of
chapter
x
that
administrative
of
expenses
are
entitled
to
be
first
pay.
they
do
have
that
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
one
to
my
knowledge
has
contested
that
the
administrative
expenses
have
the
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
just
what
is
meant
by
priority
that's
being
contested
here,
that
is
correct.
well,
our
claim
is
that
as
a
priority
creditor
admittedly
a
priority
creditor
the
government
cannot
be
required
when
the
lower
ranking
creditors
are
being
paid
in
cash
to
accept
a
deferral
without
interest
of
a
portion
of
its
payments
or
they
put
the
matter
in
other
way
we
contend
that
no
lower
ranking
creditor
can
over
the
government’s
objection
be
paid
until
the
government’s
claims
have
first
been
satisfied
which
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
normal
meaning
of
priority
in
bankruptcy.
in
the
alternative,
we
do
contend
that
the
government
has
at
least
entitled
to
interest
from
the
time
of
the
payment
to
the
lower
ranking
creditors
until
the
time
of
the
deferred
payment
to
it
to
compensate
it
for
the
deferral.
but
out
principle
contention
is
that
the
government
as
the
priority
creditor
should
not
be
the
one
to
bear
the
risk
that
the
deferred
payments
will
not
materialized
but
should
instead
be
paid
first.
in
making
our
contention,
we
rely
on
several
different
guide
posts
because
as
i
have
already
said
chapter
x
does
not
include
a
specific
comprehensive
provisions
setting
for
the
hierarchy
of
priorities
as
section
64
does
for
ordinarily
liquidating
bankruptcy
proceedings.
the
most
venerable
source
of
the
government's
priority
rights
in
this
case
is
section
3466
of
the
revised
statutes
which
is
on
page
41
of
our
brief
and
in
title
31
of
the
united
states
code.
this
provision
originated
in
acts
of
congress
of
the
late
18th
century
which
they
had
their
roots
in
the
sovereign
priority
of
the
crown.
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
debts
due
to
the
united
states
shall
be
first
satisfied
whenever
as
is
the
undisputed
case
here
that
debtor
is
insolvent
and
has
committed
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
decisions
of
this
court
as
cited
in
our
brief
have
established
that
tax
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
or
among
those
covered
by
the
broad
language
of
this
provision.
the
plan
upheld
by
the
courts
below
plainly
does
not
comply
with
this
statutory
requirement
of
the
government's
claims
shall
be
first
satisfied.
and
there
is
on
the
face
of
things
no
reason
why
this
provision
is
not
controlling.
it
manifests
the
continuous
congressional
policy
that
the
claims
of
the
federal
treasury
and
the
important
public
needs
to
be
served
by
the
funds
in
that
treasury
are
to
be
placed
ahead
of
the
also
just
claims
of
unsecured
creditors
who
did
business
with
the
debtor
for
profit.
in
light
of
this
important
public
purpose
of
the
priority
statute,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
only
the
plainest
inconsistency
would
warrant
the
finding
of
an
implied
exception
to
the
clear
command
of
section
3466.
it
was
said
most
recently
in
united
states
department
of
agriculture
against
redmond
in
volume
330,
united
states.
these
considerations
and
others
led
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
conclude
five
and
a
half
years
ago
in
a
thoughtful
opinion
by
judge
reeves
that
section
3466
is
fully
applicable
to
chapter
x
proceedings
that's
united
states
against
andersen
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
the
same
conclusion
had
earlier
been
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
and
third
circuits
in
cases
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
this
court
has
not
previously
had
occasion
to
decide
whether
this
provision
is
applicable
to
chapter
x.
the
court
below
came
to
the
contrary
conclusion
that
section
3466
is
superseded
by
the
provisions
of
chapter
x.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
other
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
deciding
that
this
statute
is
entirely
compatible
with
chapter
x
and
we
go
beyond
that
and
contend
that
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
themselves
in
the
light
of
their
legislative
history
and
as
interpreted
by
this
court
independently
provide
a
priority
right
for
the
government’s
tax
claims
which
the
plan
here
did
not
satisfied.
the
principle
provision
in
chapter
x
that
is
pertinent
is
section
199
on
page
42
of
our
brief
and
the
second
sentence
is
the
pertinent
language
beginning
at
the
end
of
line
7
of
section
199.
if
in
any
proceeding
under
this
chapter,
the
united
states
as
a
secured
or
unsecured
creditor
on
claims
for
taxes
or
customs
duties
and
the
parenthetical
may
be
omitted.
no
plan
which
does
not
provide
for
the
payment
thereof
shall
be
confirmed
by
the
judge
except
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
lesser
amount
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
certified
by
the
court
followed
by
a
proviso
which
is
irrelevant
here.
nothing
in
this
language
which
gives
the
secretary
the
right
to
demand
or
to
forgo
full
payment
is
inconsistent
with
the
command
of
section
3466
as
to
the
relative
priority
of
that
right
to
payment
as
against
other
claims.
the
command
of
the
government's
claim
shall
be
first
satisfied.
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
section
199
recounted
in
detail
in
our
brief
shows
that
congress
knew
that
section
3466
had
been
applied
in
equity
receivership
proceedings
involving
insolvent
corporations.
and
that
in
enacting
the
statutory
successors
to
equity
receivership
which
culminated
in
chapter
x.
congress
manifested
no
intention
to
diminish
the
government's
priority
rights
and
rejected
a
specific
recommendation
that
is
do
so,
but
instead
was
concerned
to
provide
for
protection
for
the
government
in
section
199
not
only
as
insolvent
debtors
to
whom
section
3466
applies,
but
more
generally,
as
to
all
debtors
involved
in
chapter
x
reorganizations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
congress
also
provided
specifically
in
section
199
in
its
predecessor
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
compromise
the
government's
rights
and
in
appropriate
cases
this
enables
the
secretary
to
contribute
to
chapter
x’s
objective
of
fostering
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
when
feasible.
but
the
granting
of
this
power
to
compromise
does
not
imply
that
the
rights
themselves
are
diminished
and
as
i
already
mentioned
on
the
face
of
the
statute
--
this
language
providing
for
payment
is
the
only
language
used
when
congress
wish
to
provide
for
a
priority
right
in
chapter
x.
and
in
any
event
the
contrast
within
section
199
between
payment
and
acceptance
of
a
lesser
amount
shows
to
us
under
face
of
the
statute
that
the
government’s
rights
were
not
satisfied
in
this
case.
there
is
another
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below
namely
the
provisions
in
chapter
x
requiring
that
the
reorganization
plan
be
fair
and
equitable.
but
these
provisions
do
not
lead
each
district
court
free
to
get
a
fact
to
its
own
notions
of
what
is
fair
and
equitable.
in
this
field,
the
words
“fair
and
equitable”
are
terms
of
art
which
acquired
their
meaning
through
judicial
interpretations
in
equity
reorganization
proceedings
that
is
what
this
court
held
with
respect
to
chapter
x
unanimously
in
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
some
years
ago.
and
one
aspect
of
the
meaning
of
fair
and
equitable
is
broadly
stated
that
creditors
of
a
junior
class
may
not
be
given
something
of
value
at
the
expense
of
non-consenting
creditors
of
a
senior
class
so
called
rule
of
absolute
priority
which
we
believe
as
equally
applicable
to
the
difference
between
the
government’s
statutory
right
to
full
payment
and
the
claims
of
creditors
who
do
not
have
such
a
right
as
it
is
to
the
classes
of
creditors
to
which
it
has
been
applied
by
this
court.
but
whether
or
not,
the
decision
below
actually
violates
the
fair
and
equitable
provisions
of
chapter
x.
those
provisions
surely
do
not
justify
the
refusal
of
the
courts
below
to
afford
the
governments
the
rights
specifically
granted
by
sections
3466
and
199.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
brief
points,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
apparent
to
us
from
counsel's
own
chart
that
somebody
is
taking
something
away
from
the
united
states
in
this
case
compared
to
what
we
would
have
had
in
a
liquidated
distribution
where
the
initial
payment
would
have
been
$160,000.00.
now,
it’s
$37,500.00.
it's
not
fair
and
equitable
under
established
principles
for
the
priority
claimant
to
have
to
suffer
the
expense
of
giving
something
of
value
to
claimants
with
less
priority
against
its
will.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
not
my
assumption.
the
contention
is
being
put
by
the
respondent
that
this
is
the
appropriate
comparison.
i
wish
to
point
out
also
that
depending
on
the
cost
of
administration
perhaps
the
unsecured
creditors
would
in
fact
eventually
get
more
but
then
that
some
really
should
be
discounted
by
the
period
of
waiting
for
it
in
addition
to
taking
into
account
the
risk
that
it
will
not
materialize
which
would
be
born
by
unsecured
creditors
in
that
situation.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
recent
opinion,
mr.
justice
white’s
protective
committee
against
andersen
that
in
chapter
x
there
is
authority
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasure
to
bargain
to
compromise
and
that
bargain
and
compromise
among
claimants
place
a
very
important
role
in
accomplishing
the
objects
of
section
10.
and
while
it
may
seem
that
in
this
case
we
are
arguing
for
a
rigid
rule
of
priority.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
the
priority
that
gives
the
secretary
to
bargaining
power
to
induce
others
to
enter
into
these
compromises
and
accomplish
the
objectives.
we
did
bargain
previously
and
accept
the
plan
in
1957
in
this
very
case
which
shared
our
rights
with
others.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
sir.
our
own
contention
would
have
been
that
we
should
be
paid
now
what
was
being
paid
under
the
plan
that
we
have
the
right
to
be
paid
what
was
being
under
the
plan
to
the
junior
creditors
rather
than
this
particular
comparison.
we
would
look
at
the
distribution
as
being
made
under
the
plan
and
certain
of
those
we
had
a
right
too
if
we
insisted
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
the
authority
to
do
that.
we
did
previously
acquiescence
such
a
plan
1957
in
this
case.
at
that
time,
that
plan
had
rehabilitative
purposes
and
that
is
a
factor
in
our
acquiescence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
other
chart,
i
think
his
contention
was
that
eventually
there
would
be
payment
in
full
even
though
the
initial
payment
was
only
10%.
his
contention
is
that
our
right
is
satisfied
so
long
as
the
government
will
eventually
be
paid
100%
by
the
end
of
the
78
months.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
without
interest,
i
think
that
was
the
point
he
was
making
when
he
said
we
would
get
100%.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
contrast
he
was
trying
so
that
even
though
initially
under
the
plan,
we
get
only
10%
compared
to
their
20%.
we
would
get
the
additional
payments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
general
unsecured
creditors
well,
this
is
not
the
plan.
this
is
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
hypothetical
figure
that
counsel
suggest
as
what
the
--
are
general
unsecured
creditors
would
eventually
get
if
these
were
not
at
chapter
x
proceeding
but
an
ordinarily
liquidation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
concerned
with
the
single
aspect
of
the
proceedings
under
a
voluntary
petition
for
corporate
reorganization
originally
filed
in
1954
pursuant
to
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
law
by
the
debtor,
hancock
trucking
incorporated.
in
the
petition,
hancock
alleged
that
it
was
unable
to
meet
its
debts
as
they
became
due
and
requested
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
to
operate
its
business
and
manage
its
property.
the
respondent
here
is
that
trustee.
the
claims
of
the
united
states
against
the
debtor
are
for
unpaid
income
withholding,
employment
and
excise
taxes
in
the
total
amount
of
more
than
$375,000.00.
because
of
the
narrow
focus
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
government's
petition
for
a
certiorari,
little
of
the
lengthy
history
of
these
reorganization
proceedings
need
be
recounted
here.
the
issues
in
this
court
concerned
an
amended
plan
of
reorganization
filed
by
the
trustee
in
june
1967
and
approved
by
the
courts
below
over
the
government's
objection.
the
amended
plan
reflected
in
agreement
approved
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
sale
of
the
debtors
principle
asset,
its
interstate
commerce
commission
operating
rights
for
truck
freight
services
to
hennis
freight
lines
incorporated.
the
purchase
price
of
$935,000.00
was
to
be
paid
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
requiring
$300,000.00
to
be
paid
within
90
days
of
the
commission’s
approval
of
the
sale
and
the
balance
in
78
monthly
installments.
the
amended
reorganization
plan
reflecting
this
sale
agreement
did
not
contemplate
that
the
debtor
hancock
trucking
would
continue
to
exist.
the
amended
plan
is
in
effect
a
liquidation
plan.
the
government
made
no
objection
to
the
terms
of
the
sale
agreement,
its
objections
relates
solely
to
the
provisions
for
payment
to
creditors
in
the
amended
reorganization
plan.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
payments
being
made
by
hennis
trucking
company
which
has
purchased
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rights
to
operate
the
freight
line.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
the
capital
equipment
had
previously
been
disposed
off.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
major
remaining
asset
was
simply
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
license.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
be
entitled
to
object
to
it
but
the
secretary
also
would
have
had
discretion
to
accept
for
the
plan
if
he
wishes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
does
sir
specially
when
it
will
contribute
to
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
and
enable
the
debtor
to
continue
in
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government
contends
that
the
provisions
for
payment
of
creditors
in
the
amended
plan
do
not
satisfy
its
statutory
priority
of
payment
rights
and
the
respondent
trustee
admits
in
its
brief
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
priority
but
contends
that
its
rights
are
fully
satisfied
under
the
plan
and
that
is
the
issue
is
this
court.
the
contested
plan
provides
for
an
initial
payment
of
100%
of
certain
wage
claims
and
certain
state
and
local
tax
claims.
20%
of
the
claims
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
which
is
all
they
will
receive
and
10%
of
the
government’s
tax
claims
and
of
the
remaining
state
and
local
tax
claims.
the
remainder
of
the
amount
due
to
the
government
and
to
state
and
local
tax
authorities
was
to
be
paid
in
78
monthly
installments
secured
by
an
assignment
of
the
note
and
chattel
mortgage
hennis
had
executed
on
its
purchase
of
the
debtor’s
operating
rights.
this
amounts
to
an
initial
payment
on
the
government’s
total
claim
of
some
$375,400.00
of
approximately
$37,500.00
and
78
equal
monthly
installments
thereafter
of
approximately
$4,330.00
each.
no
interest
was
to
be
paid
on
the
monthly
installments
which
together
with
the
initial
payment
would
simply
total
the
$375,400.00
owing
to
the
government.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
at
the
time
of
the
initial
payment
when
lower
ranking
creditors
were
to
be
paid
in
cash
the
discounted
present
value
of
the
right
to
these
future
payments
to
the
government
plus
the
initial
payment
to
the
government
would
amount
to
approximately
$317,000.00,
some
$58,400.00
less
than
the
$375,400.00
owing
to
the
government.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
does
not
satisfy
its
priority
rights
not
because
the
government
has
a
right
to
immediate
payment
of
all
cash
that
is
on
hand
up
to
the
limit
of
its
claim
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding
which
we
do
not
urged
and
not
because
the
government
has
a
right
to
the
payment
of
interest
for
any
part
of
the
post
petition
period
preceding
cash
payment
to
lower
ranking
creditors.
we
recognize
that
there
isn't
a
right
to
such
interest
on
the
government’s
claims.
our
contention
is
simply
that
the
government
as
a
priority
creditor
cannot
be
required
at
the
time
when
non-priority
creditors
are
being
paid
in
cash
to
accept
iou's
payable
only
in
the
future
the
part
of
its
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
(voice
overlap)
it's
admitted
that
we're
entitled
to
full
payment.
the
issue
is
when?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
meant
to
say
it's
admitted
by
the
respondent
that
they
were
entitled
to
full
payment.
that
is
the
issue
between
us.
of
course
we
contend
is
that
what
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
alternative
contention
that
we
have
a
right
to
take
the
discounting
into
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
also
contend
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
first
satisfied
under
section
3466
of
the
revised
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
i
just
said
was
in
chapter
x
proceedings.
we
do
not
claim
a
right
to
the
immediate
disbursement
of
cash
that
is
not
being
paid
to
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
claim
that
because
cash
is
on
hand
and
we
are
creditor
we
have
a
right
to
the
immediate
payment
of
our
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
when
cash
is
being
paid
to
creditors,
we
claim
the
right
to
be
satisfied
first.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
limit
of
what's
being
paid
to
creditors,
yes
mr.
justice.
we
claim
a
right
to
be
paid
to
ahead
of
nonpriority
creditors
when
payments
are
being
made
to
creditors.
we
do
not
claim
a
right
to
insist
that
the
payments
be
made
when
other
uses
are
being
made
of
the
money
that
the
trustee
holds.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
general
priority
provision
in
chapter
x
mr.
justice,
the
only
comprehensive
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
provision
for
administrative
expenses.
it’s
the
only
other
provision
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
wage
priority
in
chapter
x.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
wage
priority
in
section
64
of
the
act
which
by
section
102
of
the
act
is
expressly
inapplicable
to
chapter
x.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
granting
them
priority
in
chapter
x,
but
there
has
been
lengthy
litigation
about
whether
they
have
a
priority
ahead
of
the
3466
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
do
contend
that
you
have
to
abide
by
the
classes
of
priority
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
it’s
been
held
in
equity
reorganization
equity
receivership
proceedings
that
secured
creditors
at
least
the
mortgagees
have
priority
ahead
of
the
government’s
priority
under
3466.
there
has
been
disagreement
about
other
secured
creditors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
believe
that
the
standards
of
priority
that
prevail
in
equity
receiverships
have
been
carried
over
into
chapter
x,
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
understanding
of
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
is
that
if
the
secured
creditors
object
to
that,
they
have
a
right
to
insist
on
their
payments
being
made
first,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
not
essential
for
your
case
mr.
justice
because
we
have
a
statutory
right
and
revised
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
moreover,
we
have
an
explicit
right
in
section
199
in
chapter
x
to
object
to
the
plan
if
it
doesn’t
satisfy
our
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it’s
more
explicit
that
it’s
a
right
to
have
our
claim
first
satisfied
that’s
the
language
used
in
section
3466
where
there’s
no
explicit
statutory
language
giving
the
secured
creditors
such
a
right.
they
will
have
to
draw
their
rights
from
the
judicial
interpretations
of
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
and
equity
receivership
proceedings
and
their
arguably
would
be
more
leeway
for
the
courts
to
consider
making
exceptions
to
some
of
the
rules
that
have
been
established
in
those
proceedings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
essential
because
we
don’t
think
we
received
the
full
payment
right
granted
in
section
199
since
the
discounting
of
our
claims
was
never
taken
into
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
also
rely
on
the
idea
that
chapter
x
grants
two
priorities
only.
there
are
only
two
explicit
priorities
in
chapter
x
and
i'll
turn
into
that
right
now.
one
of
them
is
reproduced
on
section
43
of
our
brief
and
that
is
section
216,
number
three
--
subsection
3
a
plan
oft
reorganization
under
this
chapter
shall
provide
for
the
payment
of
all
cost
and
expenses
of
administration
and
other
allowances
which
may
be
approved
or
made
by
the
judge.
that
is
the
only
statutory
basis
for
the
priority
for
administrative
expenses
in
chapter
x.
if
the
terminology
used
is
the
same
terminology
used
for
the
government’s
tax
claim
priority
that
the
plan
of
the
right
is
to
have
the
plan
provide
for
the
payment.
and
we
believe
that
section
199
which
is
the
provision
in
section
--
in
chapter
x
which
gives
us
our
priority
rights
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
followed
in
that
chapter
also
in
body
a
notion
of
priority.
everyone
has
assumed
and
tried
along
in
the
administration
of
chapter
x
that
administrative
of
expenses
are
entitled
to
be
first
pay.
they
do
have
that
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
one
to
my
knowledge
has
contested
that
the
administrative
expenses
have
the
priority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
just
what
is
meant
by
priority
that's
being
contested
here,
that
is
correct.
well,
our
claim
is
that
as
a
priority
creditor
admittedly
a
priority
creditor
the
government
cannot
be
required
when
the
lower
ranking
creditors
are
being
paid
in
cash
to
accept
a
deferral
without
interest
of
a
portion
of
its
payments
or
they
put
the
matter
in
other
way
we
contend
that
no
lower
ranking
creditor
can
over
the
government’s
objection
be
paid
until
the
government’s
claims
have
first
been
satisfied
which
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
normal
meaning
of
priority
in
bankruptcy.
in
the
alternative,
we
do
contend
that
the
government
has
at
least
entitled
to
interest
from
the
time
of
the
payment
to
the
lower
ranking
creditors
until
the
time
of
the
deferred
payment
to
it
to
compensate
it
for
the
deferral.
but
out
principle
contention
is
that
the
government
as
the
priority
creditor
should
not
be
the
one
to
bear
the
risk
that
the
deferred
payments
will
not
materialized
but
should
instead
be
paid
first.
in
making
our
contention,
we
rely
on
several
different
guide
posts
because
as
i
have
already
said
chapter
x
does
not
include
a
specific
comprehensive
provisions
setting
for
the
hierarchy
of
priorities
as
section
64
does
for
ordinarily
liquidating
bankruptcy
proceedings.
the
most
venerable
source
of
the
government's
priority
rights
in
this
case
is
section
3466
of
the
revised
statutes
which
is
on
page
41
of
our
brief
and
in
title
31
of
the
united
states
code.
this
provision
originated
in
acts
of
congress
of
the
late
18th
century
which
they
had
their
roots
in
the
sovereign
priority
of
the
crown.
the
statute
expressly
provides
that
the
debts
due
to
the
united
states
shall
be
first
satisfied
whenever
as
is
the
undisputed
case
here
that
debtor
is
insolvent
and
has
committed
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
decisions
of
this
court
as
cited
in
our
brief
have
established
that
tax
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
or
among
those
covered
by
the
broad
language
of
this
provision.
the
plan
upheld
by
the
courts
below
plainly
does
not
comply
with
this
statutory
requirement
of
the
government's
claims
shall
be
first
satisfied.
and
there
is
on
the
face
of
things
no
reason
why
this
provision
is
not
controlling.
it
manifests
the
continuous
congressional
policy
that
the
claims
of
the
federal
treasury
and
the
important
public
needs
to
be
served
by
the
funds
in
that
treasury
are
to
be
placed
ahead
of
the
also
just
claims
of
unsecured
creditors
who
did
business
with
the
debtor
for
profit.
in
light
of
this
important
public
purpose
of
the
priority
statute,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
only
the
plainest
inconsistency
would
warrant
the
finding
of
an
implied
exception
to
the
clear
command
of
section
3466.
it
was
said
most
recently
in
united
states
department
of
agriculture
against
redmond
in
volume
330,
united
states.
these
considerations
and
others
led
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
conclude
five
and
a
half
years
ago
in
a
thoughtful
opinion
by
judge
reeves
that
section
3466
is
fully
applicable
to
chapter
x
proceedings
that's
united
states
against
andersen
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
the
same
conclusion
had
earlier
been
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
and
third
circuits
in
cases
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
this
court
has
not
previously
had
occasion
to
decide
whether
this
provision
is
applicable
to
chapter
x.
the
court
below
came
to
the
contrary
conclusion
that
section
3466
is
superseded
by
the
provisions
of
chapter
x.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
other
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
deciding
that
this
statute
is
entirely
compatible
with
chapter
x
and
we
go
beyond
that
and
contend
that
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
themselves
in
the
light
of
their
legislative
history
and
as
interpreted
by
this
court
independently
provide
a
priority
right
for
the
government’s
tax
claims
which
the
plan
here
did
not
satisfied.
the
principle
provision
in
chapter
x
that
is
pertinent
is
section
199
on
page
42
of
our
brief
and
the
second
sentence
is
the
pertinent
language
beginning
at
the
end
of
line
7
of
section
199.
if
in
any
proceeding
under
this
chapter,
the
united
states
as
a
secured
or
unsecured
creditor
on
claims
for
taxes
or
customs
duties
and
the
parenthetical
may
be
omitted.
no
plan
which
does
not
provide
for
the
payment
thereof
shall
be
confirmed
by
the
judge
except
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
lesser
amount
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
certified
by
the
court
followed
by
a
proviso
which
is
irrelevant
here.
nothing
in
this
language
which
gives
the
secretary
the
right
to
demand
or
to
forgo
full
payment
is
inconsistent
with
the
command
of
section
3466
as
to
the
relative
priority
of
that
right
to
payment
as
against
other
claims.
the
command
of
the
government's
claim
shall
be
first
satisfied.
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
section
199
recounted
in
detail
in
our
brief
shows
that
congress
knew
that
section
3466
had
been
applied
in
equity
receivership
proceedings
involving
insolvent
corporations.
and
that
in
enacting
the
statutory
successors
to
equity
receivership
which
culminated
in
chapter
x.
congress
manifested
no
intention
to
diminish
the
government's
priority
rights
and
rejected
a
specific
recommendation
that
is
do
so,
but
instead
was
concerned
to
provide
for
protection
for
the
government
in
section
199
not
only
as
insolvent
debtors
to
whom
section
3466
applies,
but
more
generally,
as
to
all
debtors
involved
in
chapter
x
reorganizations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
congress
also
provided
specifically
in
section
199
in
its
predecessor
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
compromise
the
government's
rights
and
in
appropriate
cases
this
enables
the
secretary
to
contribute
to
chapter
x’s
objective
of
fostering
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
when
feasible.
but
the
granting
of
this
power
to
compromise
does
not
imply
that
the
rights
themselves
are
diminished
and
as
i
already
mentioned
on
the
face
of
the
statute
--
this
language
providing
for
payment
is
the
only
language
used
when
congress
wish
to
provide
for
a
priority
right
in
chapter
x.
and
in
any
event
the
contrast
within
section
199
between
payment
and
acceptance
of
a
lesser
amount
shows
to
us
under
face
of
the
statute
that
the
government’s
rights
were
not
satisfied
in
this
case.
there
is
another
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below
namely
the
provisions
in
chapter
x
requiring
that
the
reorganization
plan
be
fair
and
equitable.
but
these
provisions
do
not
lead
each
district
court
free
to
get
a
fact
to
its
own
notions
of
what
is
fair
and
equitable.
in
this
field,
the
words
“fair
and
equitable”
are
terms
of
art
which
acquired
their
meaning
through
judicial
interpretations
in
equity
reorganization
proceedings
that
is
what
this
court
held
with
respect
to
chapter
x
unanimously
in
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
some
years
ago.
and
one
aspect
of
the
meaning
of
fair
and
equitable
is
broadly
stated
that
creditors
of
a
junior
class
may
not
be
given
something
of
value
at
the
expense
of
non-consenting
creditors
of
a
senior
class
so
called
rule
of
absolute
priority
which
we
believe
as
equally
applicable
to
the
difference
between
the
government’s
statutory
right
to
full
payment
and
the
claims
of
creditors
who
do
not
have
such
a
right
as
it
is
to
the
classes
of
creditors
to
which
it
has
been
applied
by
this
court.
but
whether
or
not,
the
decision
below
actually
violates
the
fair
and
equitable
provisions
of
chapter
x.
those
provisions
surely
do
not
justify
the
refusal
of
the
courts
below
to
afford
the
governments
the
rights
specifically
granted
by
sections
3466
and
199.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
brief
points,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
apparent
to
us
from
counsel's
own
chart
that
somebody
is
taking
something
away
from
the
united
states
in
this
case
compared
to
what
we
would
have
had
in
a
liquidated
distribution
where
the
initial
payment
would
have
been
$160,000.00.
now,
it’s
$37,500.00.
it's
not
fair
and
equitable
under
established
principles
for
the
priority
claimant
to
have
to
suffer
the
expense
of
giving
something
of
value
to
claimants
with
less
priority
against
its
will.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
not
my
assumption.
the
contention
is
being
put
by
the
respondent
that
this
is
the
appropriate
comparison.
i
wish
to
point
out
also
that
depending
on
the
cost
of
administration
perhaps
the
unsecured
creditors
would
in
fact
eventually
get
more
but
then
that
some
really
should
be
discounted
by
the
period
of
waiting
for
it
in
addition
to
taking
into
account
the
risk
that
it
will
not
materialize
which
would
be
born
by
unsecured
creditors
in
that
situation.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
recent
opinion,
mr.
justice
white’s
protective
committee
against
andersen
that
in
chapter
x
there
is
authority
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasure
to
bargain
to
compromise
and
that
bargain
and
compromise
among
claimants
place
a
very
important
role
in
accomplishing
the
objects
of
section
10.
and
while
it
may
seem
that
in
this
case
we
are
arguing
for
a
rigid
rule
of
priority.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
the
priority
that
gives
the
secretary
to
bargaining
power
to
induce
others
to
enter
into
these
compromises
and
accomplish
the
objectives.
we
did
bargain
previously
and
accept
the
plan
in
1957
in
this
very
case
which
shared
our
rights
with
others.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
sir.
our
own
contention
would
have
been
that
we
should
be
paid
now
what
was
being
paid
under
the
plan
that
we
have
the
right
to
be
paid
what
was
being
under
the
plan
to
the
junior
creditors
rather
than
this
particular
comparison.
we
would
look
at
the
distribution
as
being
made
under
the
plan
and
certain
of
those
we
had
a
right
too
if
we
insisted
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
the
authority
to
do
that.
we
did
previously
acquiescence
such
a
plan
1957
in
this
case.
at
that
time,
that
plan
had
rehabilitative
purposes
and
that
is
a
factor
in
our
acquiescence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
other
chart,
i
think
his
contention
was
that
eventually
there
would
be
payment
in
full
even
though
the
initial
payment
was
only
10%.
his
contention
is
that
our
right
is
satisfied
so
long
as
the
government
will
eventually
be
paid
100%
by
the
end
of
the
78
months.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
without
interest,
i
think
that
was
the
point
he
was
making
when
he
said
we
would
get
100%.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
contrast
he
was
trying
so
that
even
though
initially
under
the
plan,
we
get
only
10%
compared
to
their
20%.
we
would
get
the
additional
payments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
general
unsecured
creditors
well,
this
is
not
the
plan.
this
is
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
the
hypothetical
figure
that
counsel
suggest
as
what
the
--
are
general
unsecured
creditors
would
eventually
get
if
these
were
not
at
chapter
x
proceeding
but
an
ordinarily
liquidation.
