mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
youre
pausing
for
a
moment
could
you
answer
this
for
me.
if
the
plan
had
provided
for
equal
participation
across
the
board,
would
you
still
be
objecting
to
it
on
a
priority
basis
for
the
tax
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
can
and
sometimes
does
accept,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
regard
this
is
simply
a
voluntary
waiver
by
the
government
of
the
priority
claim.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

chief

warren
e.

what
do
you
think
about
the
holdings
in
the
case
opinion
and
in
consolidated
rock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed
that
--
unless
i
missed
it
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
they
didn't
refer
to
them
or
cite
them.
did
i
miss
them?
did
i
overlook
them?
but
don't
stop
now.
did
you
have
a
recollection
of
that
or
did
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
cited
four
or
five
case
but
they
didn't
mention
either
of
those
if
i
read
it
correctly.
i
was
a
little
puzzled
by
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
thought
they
were
following
these
cases
which
would
certainly
be
[sneezes]
that’s
curious
they
don't
think
to
cite
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
--
even
though
your
lunch
hour
is
short
you
might
check
that
out
to
see
if
i
missed
something.
chief

very
well.

mr.

chief

e.

well,
if
that
isn't
your
position,
you
are
in
difficulty
aren't
you?
there
is
not
alternative
position
for
you
to
take.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
another
thing
isn't
it
possible
that
taking
justice
white's
hypothetical
case
that
the
payment
out
to
all
the
unsecured
general
creditors
in
full
at
the
outset
has
at
least
the
potential
for
so
undermining
the
position
of
the
debtor
that
they
might
never
get
to
paying
the
united
states
or
the
deferred
creditors
at
the
end
of
the
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
why
the
priority
was
granted
to
the
united
states
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
just
what
i
have
said?
i
thought
i
said
it.

that

to

to

chief

that
is
if
the

chief

but
counsel,
if
the
united

is
right
on
their
argument
about
the
priorities,
then
these
matters
become
irrelevant
because
the
wisdom
of
their
challenging
the
plan
is
not
for
us
if
indeed
there
is
a
priority.
chief

warren
e.

but
there
you're
arguing
the
wisdom
of
it
again?
chief

thank
you

do
you
have

further
counsel?

i
don't

is
there
any

the

paid
over
that
basis.
i
suppose
it's
somewhere
7
years
somewhere
on
$225,000.00
at
6%.
so,
in
effect,
the
government
is
saying
to
us
i
take
it
that
as
a
matter
of
judgment
being
aside
of
priority
judging
the
equitable

of
the
