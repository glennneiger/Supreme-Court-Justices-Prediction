justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
i
guess
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
your
claim
simply
was
that
you're
entitled
the
full
payment?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
no,
you're
not
getting
it.
out
of
$374,000.00
tax
claim
to
get
$317,000.00
is
not
a
full
payment.
you
don't
admit
that
you're
getting
full
payment
at
all,
you're
not
getting
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that.
i
thought
that
you
would
be
satisfied
if
you
would
get
an
installment
payments
which
added
up
would
equal
your
full
tax
claim
as
discounted?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
right
is
to
full
payment,
isn't
it
on
circumstances
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
just
said
you
don't
claim
a
right
to
be
paid
now
in
cash
simply
because
cash
is
available,
haven’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say
so,
what
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
on
fully
in
cash?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
they
ever
get?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
end
of
the
line
for
them?
justice
potter
stewart
whereas
all
the
others
ultimately
you
say
get
a
100%.
justice
potter
stewart
that
really
isn't
the
point,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
they're
entitled
to
full
payment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
full
payment
of
$375,000.00
now
is
not
made
by
paying
installments
that
add
up
--
that
arithmetically
add
up
to
that
sum
over
a
period
of
many
years,
that’s
not
full
payment.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
other
chart,
mr.
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
other
creditors
get
20%
now
and
that's
all
they
ever
got
under
the
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
