justice
byron

white
i
suppose
that
you
would
say
that
as
a
threshold
matter
before
a
court
could
issue
the
injunction
to
enforce
the
no-strike
clause,
you
would
--
the
court
would
have
to
pass
on
the
arbitrability
of
the
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
pass
on
the
scope
of
the
no-strike
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
any
exceptions
to
it
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
about
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
courts
going
to
end
up
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
arbitrators
work
just
to
get
to
the
injunction
question,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
contract
still
that
--
i
mean,
which
this
dispute
arose
still
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
no
one
has
to
know
--
nobody
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
contract
about
the
--
about
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
dispute
was
arbitrable?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
could
get
an
order
to
arbitrate,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
then
you
can
arbitrate
and
you
can
enforce
the
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
--
your
opponents
can
or
am
i
wrong,
do
they
--
don't
they
concede
that
a
court
could
issue
an
order
enforcing
an
arbitration
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
violating
norris-laguardia?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
take
another
situation,
suppose
an
employer
discharges
an
employee
and
the
union
goes
on
a
strike,
do
you
think
that
you
should
be
able
to
enjoin
the
strike
while
the
union
arbitrates?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
that
--
what
do
you
think
about
putting
the
man
back
to
work
while
you're
arbitrating?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
to
enforce
the
no-strike
clause
if
it's
violated
by
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
or
does
not
the
norris-laguardia
act
bar
any
court
from
enjoining
a
strike
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
while
the
arbitration
goes
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
doesn't
it
bar
the
order
to
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
simply
enforcing
--
they're
simply
enforcing
a
term
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
would
--
they
agreed
on
an
arbitrator
to
settle
the
dispute,
why
does
the
union
strike?
justice
byron

white
and
in
the
contract
the
union
has
also
said,
we’ll
not
strike.
justice
byron

white
what
about
referring
to
the
arbitrator
disputes
over
a
breach
for
the
no-strike
clause?
justice
byron

isn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
be

it

justice

and
what
is
the
arbitrator
to
do
about
it?
justice
byron

so
the
courts
don't
get
in
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
confirmation
of
the
award.
justice
byron

white
what
if
the

strikes
and
the
issue
goes
to
the
arbitrator
right
away
assuming
an
arbitrator
was
available
right
away?
justice
byron

can
arbitrator

can
the
arbitrator
issue
an
injunction?
justice

and
they
ordered

can
his
award

that

to
go
back

you

do
you
