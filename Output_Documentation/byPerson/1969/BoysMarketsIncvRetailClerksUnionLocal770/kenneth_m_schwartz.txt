mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
yesterday's
session
of
the
court
there
were
some
questions
propounded
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
by
mr.
justice
white.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
for
a
couple
of
moments
to
those
questions
and
answers.
one
of
the
questions
propounded
to
counsel
was
whether
or
not
the
remedies
afforded
the
parties
under
the
present
posture
of
the
law
is
reciprocal,
and
i
can
state
that
as
it
stands
today
the
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
do
have
--
there
is
no
disparity
between
the
parties.
all
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
is
prevent
either
the
parties
to
get
a
judicial
order
against
the
other
for
conduct
that
they
may
find
is
to
be
an
alleged
violation
of
the
act.
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
prevent
either
party
from
getting
a
judicial
order
in
order
to
enforce
or
require
the
other
party
to
comply
with
them
a
provision
in
their
agreement
affording
the
opportunity
for
a
voluntary
adjustment
of
their
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
norris-laguardia
simply
prevents
either
the
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
to
get
a
judicial
order
from
any
court.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
prevents
them,
they
do
that,
yes.
the
only
exception
is,
it
does
afford
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
go
to
a
court
to
compel
arbitration
which
is
a
matter
set
forth
between
the
parties
a
voluntary
method
for
them
to
adjust
their
disputes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
it
does
bar
federal
courts
from
enjoining
the
action,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
why
does
it
not?
the
--
we
have
a
situation
in
the
collective-bargaining
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
they're
enforcing
a
term
of
the
contract
but
the
parties
have
agreed
upon
a
method
of
adjustment
of
their
disputes.
in
their
collective-bargaining
agreement,
if
you
had
an
injunction
or
temporary
restraining
order
prior
to
the
arbitration
you
have
taken
away
from
the
parties
the
rights
they
have
agreed
upon
and
bargained
for
in
their
collective-bargaining
agreement.
they
have
bargained
for
and
this
court
said
so
in
steelworkers
trilogy.
they
have
bargained
for
the
expertise
of
an
arbitrator.
if
they
are
permitted
either
party
or
both
parties
are
permitted
to
go
to
courts
when
they
have
an
argument
or
dispute
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
the
defect
takes
away
any
of
the
powers
of
the
arbitrator
may
have
in
settling
that
dispute.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
strike
situation
is
no
different
than
the
employer
taking
a
--
himself
violating
the
contract
by
say
discharging
some
employees
or
by
bringing
in
as
he
did
in
this
case,
bringing
in
a
crew,
none
bargaining
unit
people
into
a
store
to
do
bargaining
unit
work.
the
union
at
that
time
of
course
could
not
get
an
injunction
to
restrain
them
from
doing
that.
they're
irreparable
injury
that
was
referred
to
by
counsel
in
regard
to
the
strike
activity
of
the
union.
there's
no
different
than
the
irreparable
injury
in
so
far
as
an
individual
his
discharge
is
concerned,
then
the
individual
although
the
counsel
says
he
can
recover
in
damages,
we
say
that
in
regard
to
a
strike.t
the
company
can
respond
in
damages
in
regard
that
arbitrator
finding
it
to
be
so.
the
idea
being
that
the
parties
have
bargained
for
a
method
of
adjustment
of
their
disputes.
a
strike
is
a
violate
--
may
be
a
violation
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
it
may
not
depending
upon
what
the
strike
is
for.
contrary
to
that,
the
employer
can
take
actions
in
regard
to
demotions,
promotions,
subcontracting
and
all
issues
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
provides
for
they
can
violate
it.
now,
the
union
certainly
cannot
come
in
because
of
norris-laguardia
and
get
an
injunction
and
i'm
not
saying
they
should
because
the
union
and
employer
have
agreed
upon
a
method
of
bargaining.
in
that
bargain
they
have
said,
that
we
are
going
ahead
and
have
our
disputes
resolve
by
an
impartial
arbitrator.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
the
employer
had
said
for
example
he
will
not
discharge
employees
without
just
cause.
he
has
said
he
will
not
subcontract
work.
he
has
said
as
he
did
in
this
case
that
he
will
not
bring
in
others
not
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
perform
their
work
as
suppose
to
be
confirmed
by
the
bargaining
agreement.
these
are
alleged
violations
to
the
contract.
here,
the
employers
alleged
to
violate
the
contract
and
the
employers
says,
the
union
has
violated
the
contract
by
violating
to
no-strike
clause.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
yes
the
party
agreed
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
you
say
preserve
the
status
quo,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
let's
take
a
situation
of
a
discharge.
are
you
saying
that
the
status
quo
is
that
an
individual
stays
on
the
job
until
the
arbitration
takes
place?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
no.
not
a
bit,
not
anymore
so
than
it
would
be
in
regard
to
the
strike
situation
for
the
employer
for
the
simple
reason,
you
say
he
risk
covers
damages
when
he
recovers
back
pay.
that
period
of
time
that
that
individual
has
to
feed
his
family,
he
has
to
wait
until
the
arbitrator’s
award
comes
out.
what
irreparable
injury
he
has
cannot
be
determined
by
me
i
don't
know
the
status
of
his
economic
position.
most
of
our
people
today
are
--
have
credit
up
to
their
ears
and
when
they
go
ahead
and
don’t
get
pay
while
they've
got
problems.
now,
what
irreparable
injury
he
may
have,
i
don't
know
he
may
lose
his
house.
he
may
not
make
his
car
payments
and
lose
his
car.
it's
very
difficult
to
say
any
more
so
than
the
employer
can
recover
in
damages
and
they
make
the
allegation
that
their
damages
are
not
sufficient
and
not
adequate
because
they
say
that
the
damages
cannot
be
satisfying
them
because
of
irreparable
injury.
i
say
the
argument
is
the
same
on
the
other
side
of
defense
but
both
of
the
employer
and
union
have
bargained
for
this,
both
of
them
have
bargained
for
the
fact
that
they'll
submit
it
to
arbitration.
they
have
not
bargained
that
they
will
go
to
court
for
it
all
and
then
they
know
they
couldn't.
now,
the
very
fact
of
the
matter
is
this,
both
of
the
parties
here
rely
upon
the
expertise
of
the
arbitrator
and
the
reason
they
do
so
is
because
of
the
federal
labor
policy
recognizing
is
this
court
did
in
lincoln
mills
and
steelwork
trilogy
that
it’s
a
different
type
of
field.
it's
a
type
of
field
that
courts
do
not
have
the
expertise
that
is
required
in
order
to
resolve
his
problem.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
i
might
point
out
to
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
may
be
strikes
in
a
shop
or
in
a
store
that
may
not
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
for
example
we
have
those
situations
where
employees
may
walk
off
the
job
because
of
unsafe
conditions.
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
court
has
held
so.
we
have
situations
where
there
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
i'm
responding
to
the
questions
you
asked
me
about
the
strike
situation
but
we
do
have
these
things
that
we
have
to
take
into
consideration.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
--
there's
always
an
allegation
it’s
a
violation
of
a
contract
if
the
employer
brings
in
people
to
do
work
or
subcontract
work
which
is
to
be
formed
by
contract
by
bargaining
unit
people.
that
is
an
erosion
of
the
contract
and
it
has
the
same
effect
in
regard
to
irreparable
injury
as
we
have
on
the
other
side
in
defense
in
regard
to
the
employer.
i
simply
say
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
remedy
and
to
say
there
isn't
a
remedy
isn't
so
because
in
section
301
(b)
expressly
states
that
section
301
confines
for
a
lawsuit
or
damages
can
be
given
against
the
union.
now,
when
counsel
says
he
doesn't
feel
that
that's
an
adequate
remedy,
we
can
only
say
that
a
union
--
a
labor
organization
is
no
different
from
any
other
institution.
they
have
to
have
a
treasury
the
same
way
any
other
institution
has
and
if
they
run
into
a
situation
where
their
treasury
is
depleted
they’re
pretty
much
out
of
business.
so
to
say
that
is
not
adequate
it
may
not
be
satisfactory.
it
may
not
be
totally
satisfactory
to
the
employers
because
the
employers
may
like
the
idea
of
having
this
injunctive
relief.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
because
if
the
employers
felt
that
way
and
if
based
upon
the
sinclair
decision
they
felt
that
way
strongly,
from
1962
to
the
present
time
when
this
court
decided
that
the
sinclair
case
in
norris-laguardia
was
not
repealed
by
the
section
301
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
repealed.
it
seems
to
me,
it
more
or
less
was
a
mandate
to
the
parties
believing
that
the
decision
was
wrong
or
that
the
law
was
wrong
whatever
it
may
be
that
the
party
should
have
gone
to
congress
and
should
have
told
congress,
we
feel
that
norris-laguardia
should
be
repealed,
it
makes
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
this
because
in
the
sinclair
case
and
in
legislative
history
of
the
sinclair
case.
we
have
senator
taft
--
the
late
senator
taft
was
certainly
was
a
man
skilled
in
this
field.
when
he
came
out
of
the
conference
committee
on
the
senate
floor
he
pointed
out
that
the
section
301
did
not
prohibit
all
strikes.
he
pointed
out
that
section
301
did
not
repeal
norris-laguardia
act.
he
specifically
said
that
the
only
two
types
of
strike
activities
that
would
be
illegal
would
be
the
secondary
boycott
strike
and
the
jurisdictional
strike.
those
two
aspects
and
those
two
strike
activities
were
put
in
the
section
301
of
the
act
giving
the
national
labor
relations
board
making
it
a
mandatory
injunction
on
the
board
--
on
the
board
to
go
ahead
and
take
those
actions
not
to
private
litigants.
if
you
recall
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
house
bill,
there
was
a
provision
that
make
section
301
--
norris-laguardia
not
applicable
to
section
301
cases.
it
was
after
it
came
out
a
committee
that
congressman
hartley
who
also
was
the
co-author
of
the
bill,
pointed
out
specifically
that
this
aspect
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
dropped
in
the
conference
committee.
now
that
appears
to
me
and
it
was
cited
in
the
case
and
it
was
cited
by
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case.
if
i
were
in
the
other
side,
i
would
take
that
as
a
mandate
to
me
to
get
the
congress
and
have
congress
change
the
law
if
they
didn’t
feel
it
was
equitable.
now
nothing
has
happened
from
1962
to
the
present
time,
there
has
been
no
legislation
in
congress
in
regard
to
this.
there's
no
judicial
determination
which
have
warrant
any
reconsideration,
the
sinclair
aspect.
and
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
that
we
realize
when
counsel
was
asked
yesterday.
the
question
is
to
what
status
in
regard
to
the
business
community
was
since
sinclair
was
enacted.
counsel
pointed
out
that
there's
been
very
little
activity
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae
afl-cio.
they
have
a
statistic
from
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
where
they
show
a
1961
which
is
prior
to
sinclair.
there
10.8%
a
man
idle
hours
due
to
strikes
during
the
term
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
in
1961.
in
1968,
according
to
same
bureau
they
show
at
9.1%
of
the
man
hours
idle
during
the
term
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
this
is
not
say
that
because
of
sinclair
there
was
reduction
but
i
simply
say
that
there
is
no
real
impact
on
the
sinclair
decision
on
the
business
community
which
apparently
from
reading
the
briefs
of
amici
and
the
petitioner
makes
it
appear
that
there
are
some
real
reason
for
changing
the
posture
of
the
law.
so
far
as
we
can
determine
here
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
that
reason
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
parties
in
--
to
collective-bargaining
agreements
have
apparently
found
that
this
method
of
voluntary
arbitration
picking
arbitrators
with
the
expertise
is
a
desired
way
along
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
labor
law
has
recognized
the
fact
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
for
the
experts
in
this
particular
feel
because
he
run
into
also
it’s
a
complexities
in
a
contract.
we
run
it
to
aspects
of
how
many
people
are
actually
in
the
bargaining
unit?
who
should
have
overtime?
who
shouldn't
have
overtime?
what
does
the
assignment
all
works?
are
these
breaches
of
the
agreement?
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
when
we
talk
about
a
strike
or
a
lockout.
the
arbitrator
may
have
to
determine
whether
in
fact
that
strike
was
a
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
if
we
have
a
lockout,
is
it
a
question
of
a
partial
lockout
or
a
complete
lockout?
we
sometimes
think
in
terms
of
a
lockout
meaning
the
entire
plant
is
shutdown,
nobody
works
but
that
isn’t
necessarily
so.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
if
we
would
do
that
your
honor
and
we
are
talking
about
when
you
say
lockout,
i
assume
that
you're
talking
about
partial
lockout
as
well
as
any
other
type
of
lockout,
then
i
could
mention
that
to
you
very
simply
by
pointing
out
the
difference.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
there
we
have
again
exactly
what
i
was
referring
to
just
on
your
own
comment
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
say
accordance
to
the
contract
whatever
they
are.
this
court
has
said
that
the
person
who
can
best
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
violation
of
that
contract
is
the
arbitrator.
it
is
because
he
works
with
that
--
in
that
field
day
and
night.
he
becomes
the
expert
in
the
field.
the
courts
have
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
type
of
economy
and
the
type
of
labor
management
relations
requires
some
sort
of
expert.
and
admittedly,
this
court
has
said
that
the
courts
do
not
have
that
expertise.
so,
it
isn't
just
a
question
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
alright
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
that
is
true.
but
the
--
in
all
the
cases
some
lincoln
mills,
iron,
and
for
the
steelworks
trilogy,
this
court
has
spoken
in
respect
--
they
were
make
into
distinction
and
talking
about
arbitrators
and
putting
it
in
a
great
weight
upon
the
arbitrator’s
decision
as
oppose
to
the
courts
and
they
were
talking
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief
primarily
when
we
go
back
to
the
fact
where
the
individual
comes
in
with
an
allegation
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
and
asking
for
an
ex
parte
order
in
making
the
allegations
that
this
is
agreed
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
whereas
the
actual
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
requires
--
it
may
require
an
arbitrator
to
decide
and
the
court
doesn’t
really
have
the
time.
if
these
cases
were
open
to
the
courts,
there'd
be
no
use
for
arbitrators
anymore
because
by
the
time
the
parties
come
into
the
court
and
get
their
injunctive
relief
there
is
really
nothing
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
because
we
found
time
and
time
again
that
where
the
injunctive
relief
was
issued
by
a
court
there
really
wasn't
any
problem
for
the
arbitrator
at
that
particular
time.
in
so
far
as
determine
damages
in
a
301
suit
there
is
no
questions
that
the
court
has
to
take
the
evidence
very
much
the
same
of
the
arbitrator.
but
we're
talking
about
matters
relating
to
the
expertise
of
the
arbitrator
and
deferring
to
arbitration
as
such.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
said
from
lincoln
mills
and
iron,
down
that
they
deferred
to
the
arbitrators
and
the
steelworks
trilogy
makes
it
very
clear.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
that's
fine
and
the
arbitrator
can
assess
damages.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
in
this
case
incidentally
has
been
referred
to
arbitration
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
arbitrator
can
assess
damages,
he
can
do
anything.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
it's
a
little
--
it
seems
to
me
that
when
parties
have
agreed
upon
the
set
scope
of
conduct,
and
they
violate
and
they
have
agreed
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
any
dispute
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
goes
to
arbitration.
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
now,
if
in
fact
the
strike
is
a
violation
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
the
parties,
the
employer
can
and
did
in
this
case
make
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
that
motion
is
granted.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
is
what
we
bargained
for,
we
did
not
bargain
for
any
type
of
status
quo
situation
and
the
norris-laguardia
makes
it
--
the
act
makes
it
very
clear
that
section
301
in
the
matter
of
collective-bargaining
in
section
301
(b)
speaks
in
terms
of
damages.
now,
i'm
sure
without
knowing
that
counsel
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that
does
happen
by
the
way,
the
longshoremen
have
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
arbitrator
issued
an
injunction?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
his
award
can
say
that
and
if
the
union
fails
to
put
his
man
back
to
work,
the
employer
can
go
to
the
court
for
conformation
of
the
award.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
conceded
that
in
my
brief
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
the
difference
is
that
in
the
arbitrator's
award
the
parties
have
bargained
for
the
arbitration.
the
parties
normally
in
the
arbitration
clause
provide
for
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator's
award
shall
be
a
final
and
binding
award.
if
after
they
have
gone
to
the
procedure
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
one
is
before
the
fact
and
one
is
after
the
fact.
the
matter
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
certainly,
to
compel
arbitration.
they've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes
sir,
they've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
let
me
se
whether
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice.
what
is
the
difference
between
the
mandates
for
specific
performance?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
--
in
section
301,
of
course
the
federal
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
and
the
dispute
between
a
parties
and
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
parties
have
agreed
by
contract
to
go
to
a
form
being
the
arbitration
voluntarily.
parties
have
infused
to
do
that.
the
court
actually
can
and
does
compel
arbitration,
compel
the
parties
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
says
they
have
agreed
upon
a
form
of
adjustment
which
is
quite
different
from
enjoining
the
parties
from
doing
something
else.
the
difference
being
and
as
i
thought
i
mentioned
previously
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
prevent
the
parties
from
going
to
federal
court
to
seek
compliance
with
their
agreement
to
arbitrate
when
it
does
prevent
the
parties
going
to
federal
court
to
have
the
federal
courts
in
effect
require
them
to
take
certain
conduct
under
their
collective-bargaining
agreement
--
comply
with
conditions
of
that.
that
is
expressly
set
out
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
where
it
says
that
there
can
be
no
federal
district
court
can
issue
an
injunction
against
certain
activities.
this
is
not
one
of
those
activities
expressed
in
norris-laguardia
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
the
power
because
of
norris-laguardia
as
oppose
to
what
we
find
here
in
section
301
in
regard
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
way
i
understand
it
and
that
the
way
the
law
and
the
way
the
courts
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that
is
my
position
mr.
justice
black
that
it's
just
a
matter
of
--
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
statute
where
the
statute
is
clear
and
not
ambiguous.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
change
has
to
be
performed
by
congress
and
not
by
judicial
legislation
so
called.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
as
i
say
i
recognize
the
fact
that
this
court
can
change
its
opinions
in
regard
to
cases.
i
recognize
the
fact
that
they
are
not
necessarily
bound
by
stare
decisis,
but
it
is
my
feeling
that
sinclair
was
an
expression
by
this
court.
not
in
regard
to
a
policy
change
of
a
matter
left
opened
by
congress.
it
seem
to
me
that
what
the
court
said
in
sinclair
what
they
are
deferring
to
congress
and
that
is
that
have
been
clearly
set
forth
by
the
intent
of
congress
that
they're
saying
to
the
parties
that
if
this
has
to
be
changed
then
it
maybe
an
inequity
and
may
be
changed.
the
place
to
get
it
is
not
in
the
courtroom
but
to
get
it
from
congress.
congress
has
failed
to
act
in
this
matter
and
therefore
it
seems
that
there
is
no
other
answer
but
that
without
congress
acting,
we
must
take
the
intent
of
congress
applied
to
law
and
say,
that’s
where
we
stand
today.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
it
was
not
sir.
the
federal
court
read
its
own
injunction
federal
district
court
and
that
was
the
court
i
appealed
to
circuit
court
and
the
circuit
court
reversed
on
the
basis
of
sinclair.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
think
footnote
4
is
the
reason
we're
here.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
and
i
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
i
think
the
principle
to
decide
was
sinclair.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
the
way
i
understand
it,
i
may
have
understood
or
think
correctly
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
the
avco
case,
all
the
avco
case
just
cited
was
a
matter
of
procedure
when
a
case
is
removed
to
the
federal
court
from
a
state
court
and
there
is
no
remand.
we
had
remand
before,
but
at
that
point
it
took
care
of
that
problem
and
all
i
did
is
established
in
my
opinion
a
method
of
federal
labor
law
but
isn’t
a
matter
of
forum
shopping
anymore.
once
you
go
into
state
court
and
it's
removed
you
applied
the
federal
labor
law
which
you
should
have
applied
in
the
state
as
well
but
because
norris-laguardia
did
not
speak
to
the
state
we
had
a
different
situation
when
a
case
is
filed
in
the
state
as
oppose
in
federal
law.
but
the
principle
can't
be
any
different
if
in
sinclair
as
this
court
found
the
congress
expressly
set
forth
its
intent
unambiguous
then
the
avco
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
fact
that
the
remedy
may
be
different
because
this
court
happened
to
see
fit,
to
find
an
avco
that
there
would
be
no
remand.
it
seems
that
under
those
circumstances
the
principle
--
underlying
principle
in
sinclair
is
no
different
because
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
so
expressed
that
congress
must
do
something
to
change
the
law
then
i
don't
see
where
avco
is
a
matter
of
procedure
affects
it
at
all.
i
never
did
quite
understand
the
footnote
there
from
the
system.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
think.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
but
what
i
mean
i
didn't
understand
the
impact
that
avco
might
have
in
regard
to
sinclair
other
than
the
fact
as
we
did
here.
we
removed
the
case
from
the
state
court
to
federal
court
and
they
could
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
right.
and
that's
all
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
you're
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
arguing
in
this
case,
it
sounded
as
if
he
was
not
concerned
with
sinclair
but
he’s
unhappy
with
avco.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
his
reply
brief
it
seems
to
me
that
he’s
unhappy
with
the
entire
arbitration
proceeding
because
in
citing
this
one
case
from
we’re
talking
about
picking
arbitration
counsel
points
out
that
the
--
while
the
contract
hold
for
72
hours
and
then
a
12-hour
decision
he
said,
well,
my
god
it
took
four
days
for
hearing.
well,
how
long
it
would
take
if
you
went
to
court,
and
then
the
fact
that
there
was
a
decision
in
december,
the
only
way
that
they
have
a
decision
in
december
if
the
parties
agreed.
so,
i
simply
say
that
by
pointing
to
that
particular
case
in
the
same
quick
the
arbitrations
are
not
the
answer.
i
don't
agree
because
in
the
longshoremen
when
you
have
a
dispute
on
the
dock,
they
have
a
provision
in
their
contract
where
the
arbitrary
comes
right
down
to
the
dock
right
there.
it
says,
go
back
to
work
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
so
there
is
an
answer
to
these
things
and
people
with
the
expertise
in
labor
and
management
can
bargain
for
that.
and
i
failed
to
see
and
where
the
situation
has
changed
from
1962
to
today
as
i
mentioned
previously,
i
can
find
no
legislative
history,
no
legislate
act,
incidentally
legislative
history
in
1962
as
the
same
legislative
history
we
have
today.
so,
under
those
circumstances,
absent
anything
else
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sinclair
case
should
not
be
reversed
and
i
think
that’s
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
yesterday's
session
of
the
court
there
were
some
questions
propounded
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
by
mr.
justice
white.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
for
a
couple
of
moments
to
those
questions
and
answers.
one
of
the
questions
propounded
to
counsel
was
whether
or
not
the
remedies
afforded
the
parties
under
the
present
posture
of
the
law
is
reciprocal,
and
i
can
state
that
as
it
stands
today
the
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
do
have
--
there
is
no
disparity
between
the
parties.
all
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
is
prevent
either
the
parties
to
get
a
judicial
order
against
the
other
for
conduct
that
they
may
find
is
to
be
an
alleged
violation
of
the
act.
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
prevent
either
party
from
getting
a
judicial
order
in
order
to
enforce
or
require
the
other
party
to
comply
with
them
a
provision
in
their
agreement
affording
the
opportunity
for
a
voluntary
adjustment
of
their
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
norris-laguardia
simply
prevents
either
the
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
to
get
a
judicial
order
from
any
court.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
prevents
them,
they
do
that,
yes.
the
only
exception
is,
it
does
afford
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
go
to
a
court
to
compel
arbitration
which
is
a
matter
set
forth
between
the
parties
a
voluntary
method
for
them
to
adjust
their
disputes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
it
does
bar
federal
courts
from
enjoining
the
action,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
why
does
it
not?
the
--
we
have
a
situation
in
the
collective-bargaining
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
they're
enforcing
a
term
of
the
contract
but
the
parties
have
agreed
upon
a
method
of
adjustment
of
their
disputes.
in
their
collective-bargaining
agreement,
if
you
had
an
injunction
or
temporary
restraining
order
prior
to
the
arbitration
you
have
taken
away
from
the
parties
the
rights
they
have
agreed
upon
and
bargained
for
in
their
collective-bargaining
agreement.
they
have
bargained
for
and
this
court
said
so
in
steelworkers
trilogy.
they
have
bargained
for
the
expertise
of
an
arbitrator.
if
they
are
permitted
either
party
or
both
parties
are
permitted
to
go
to
courts
when
they
have
an
argument
or
dispute
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
and
the
defect
takes
away
any
of
the
powers
of
the
arbitrator
may
have
in
settling
that
dispute.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
strike
situation
is
no
different
than
the
employer
taking
a
--
himself
violating
the
contract
by
say
discharging
some
employees
or
by
bringing
in
as
he
did
in
this
case,
bringing
in
a
crew,
none
bargaining
unit
people
into
a
store
to
do
bargaining
unit
work.
the
union
at
that
time
of
course
could
not
get
an
injunction
to
restrain
them
from
doing
that.
they're
irreparable
injury
that
was
referred
to
by
counsel
in
regard
to
the
strike
activity
of
the
union.
there's
no
different
than
the
irreparable
injury
in
so
far
as
an
individual
his
discharge
is
concerned,
then
the
individual
although
the
counsel
says
he
can
recover
in
damages,
we
say
that
in
regard
to
a
strike.t
the
company
can
respond
in
damages
in
regard
that
arbitrator
finding
it
to
be
so.
the
idea
being
that
the
parties
have
bargained
for
a
method
of
adjustment
of
their
disputes.
a
strike
is
a
violate
--
may
be
a
violation
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
it
may
not
depending
upon
what
the
strike
is
for.
contrary
to
that,
the
employer
can
take
actions
in
regard
to
demotions,
promotions,
subcontracting
and
all
issues
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
provides
for
they
can
violate
it.
now,
the
union
certainly
cannot
come
in
because
of
norris-laguardia
and
get
an
injunction
and
i'm
not
saying
they
should
because
the
union
and
employer
have
agreed
upon
a
method
of
bargaining.
in
that
bargain
they
have
said,
that
we
are
going
ahead
and
have
our
disputes
resolve
by
an
impartial
arbitrator.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
the
employer
had
said
for
example
he
will
not
discharge
employees
without
just
cause.
he
has
said
he
will
not
subcontract
work.
he
has
said
as
he
did
in
this
case
that
he
will
not
bring
in
others
not
parties
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
perform
their
work
as
suppose
to
be
confirmed
by
the
bargaining
agreement.
these
are
alleged
violations
to
the
contract.
here,
the
employers
alleged
to
violate
the
contract
and
the
employers
says,
the
union
has
violated
the
contract
by
violating
to
no-strike
clause.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
yes
the
party
agreed
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
you
say
preserve
the
status
quo,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
let's
take
a
situation
of
a
discharge.
are
you
saying
that
the
status
quo
is
that
an
individual
stays
on
the
job
until
the
arbitration
takes
place?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
no.
not
a
bit,
not
anymore
so
than
it
would
be
in
regard
to
the
strike
situation
for
the
employer
for
the
simple
reason,
you
say
he
risk
covers
damages
when
he
recovers
back
pay.
that
period
of
time
that
that
individual
has
to
feed
his
family,
he
has
to
wait
until
the
arbitrator’s
award
comes
out.
what
irreparable
injury
he
has
cannot
be
determined
by
me
i
don't
know
the
status
of
his
economic
position.
most
of
our
people
today
are
--
have
credit
up
to
their
ears
and
when
they
go
ahead
and
don’t
get
pay
while
they've
got
problems.
now,
what
irreparable
injury
he
may
have,
i
don't
know
he
may
lose
his
house.
he
may
not
make
his
car
payments
and
lose
his
car.
it's
very
difficult
to
say
any
more
so
than
the
employer
can
recover
in
damages
and
they
make
the
allegation
that
their
damages
are
not
sufficient
and
not
adequate
because
they
say
that
the
damages
cannot
be
satisfying
them
because
of
irreparable
injury.
i
say
the
argument
is
the
same
on
the
other
side
of
defense
but
both
of
the
employer
and
union
have
bargained
for
this,
both
of
them
have
bargained
for
the
fact
that
they'll
submit
it
to
arbitration.
they
have
not
bargained
that
they
will
go
to
court
for
it
all
and
then
they
know
they
couldn't.
now,
the
very
fact
of
the
matter
is
this,
both
of
the
parties
here
rely
upon
the
expertise
of
the
arbitrator
and
the
reason
they
do
so
is
because
of
the
federal
labor
policy
recognizing
is
this
court
did
in
lincoln
mills
and
steelwork
trilogy
that
it’s
a
different
type
of
field.
it's
a
type
of
field
that
courts
do
not
have
the
expertise
that
is
required
in
order
to
resolve
his
problem.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
i
might
point
out
to
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
may
be
strikes
in
a
shop
or
in
a
store
that
may
not
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
for
example
we
have
those
situations
where
employees
may
walk
off
the
job
because
of
unsafe
conditions.
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
court
has
held
so.
we
have
situations
where
there
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
i'm
responding
to
the
questions
you
asked
me
about
the
strike
situation
but
we
do
have
these
things
that
we
have
to
take
into
consideration.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
--
there's
always
an
allegation
it’s
a
violation
of
a
contract
if
the
employer
brings
in
people
to
do
work
or
subcontract
work
which
is
to
be
formed
by
contract
by
bargaining
unit
people.
that
is
an
erosion
of
the
contract
and
it
has
the
same
effect
in
regard
to
irreparable
injury
as
we
have
on
the
other
side
in
defense
in
regard
to
the
employer.
i
simply
say
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
remedy
and
to
say
there
isn't
a
remedy
isn't
so
because
in
section
301
(b)
expressly
states
that
section
301
confines
for
a
lawsuit
or
damages
can
be
given
against
the
union.
now,
when
counsel
says
he
doesn't
feel
that
that's
an
adequate
remedy,
we
can
only
say
that
a
union
--
a
labor
organization
is
no
different
from
any
other
institution.
they
have
to
have
a
treasury
the
same
way
any
other
institution
has
and
if
they
run
into
a
situation
where
their
treasury
is
depleted
they’re
pretty
much
out
of
business.
so
to
say
that
is
not
adequate
it
may
not
be
satisfactory.
it
may
not
be
totally
satisfactory
to
the
employers
because
the
employers
may
like
the
idea
of
having
this
injunctive
relief.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
because
if
the
employers
felt
that
way
and
if
based
upon
the
sinclair
decision
they
felt
that
way
strongly,
from
1962
to
the
present
time
when
this
court
decided
that
the
sinclair
case
in
norris-laguardia
was
not
repealed
by
the
section
301
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
repealed.
it
seems
to
me,
it
more
or
less
was
a
mandate
to
the
parties
believing
that
the
decision
was
wrong
or
that
the
law
was
wrong
whatever
it
may
be
that
the
party
should
have
gone
to
congress
and
should
have
told
congress,
we
feel
that
norris-laguardia
should
be
repealed,
it
makes
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
this
because
in
the
sinclair
case
and
in
legislative
history
of
the
sinclair
case.
we
have
senator
taft
--
the
late
senator
taft
was
certainly
was
a
man
skilled
in
this
field.
when
he
came
out
of
the
conference
committee
on
the
senate
floor
he
pointed
out
that
the
section
301
did
not
prohibit
all
strikes.
he
pointed
out
that
section
301
did
not
repeal
norris-laguardia
act.
he
specifically
said
that
the
only
two
types
of
strike
activities
that
would
be
illegal
would
be
the
secondary
boycott
strike
and
the
jurisdictional
strike.
those
two
aspects
and
those
two
strike
activities
were
put
in
the
section
301
of
the
act
giving
the
national
labor
relations
board
making
it
a
mandatory
injunction
on
the
board
--
on
the
board
to
go
ahead
and
take
those
actions
not
to
private
litigants.
if
you
recall
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
house
bill,
there
was
a
provision
that
make
section
301
--
norris-laguardia
not
applicable
to
section
301
cases.
it
was
after
it
came
out
a
committee
that
congressman
hartley
who
also
was
the
co-author
of
the
bill,
pointed
out
specifically
that
this
aspect
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
dropped
in
the
conference
committee.
now
that
appears
to
me
and
it
was
cited
in
the
case
and
it
was
cited
by
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case.
if
i
were
in
the
other
side,
i
would
take
that
as
a
mandate
to
me
to
get
the
congress
and
have
congress
change
the
law
if
they
didn’t
feel
it
was
equitable.
now
nothing
has
happened
from
1962
to
the
present
time,
there
has
been
no
legislation
in
congress
in
regard
to
this.
there's
no
judicial
determination
which
have
warrant
any
reconsideration,
the
sinclair
aspect.
and
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
that
we
realize
when
counsel
was
asked
yesterday.
the
question
is
to
what
status
in
regard
to
the
business
community
was
since
sinclair
was
enacted.
counsel
pointed
out
that
there's
been
very
little
activity
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae
afl-cio.
they
have
a
statistic
from
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
where
they
show
a
1961
which
is
prior
to
sinclair.
there
10.8%
a
man
idle
hours
due
to
strikes
during
the
term
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
in
1961.
in
1968,
according
to
same
bureau
they
show
at
9.1%
of
the
man
hours
idle
during
the
term
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
this
is
not
say
that
because
of
sinclair
there
was
reduction
but
i
simply
say
that
there
is
no
real
impact
on
the
sinclair
decision
on
the
business
community
which
apparently
from
reading
the
briefs
of
amici
and
the
petitioner
makes
it
appear
that
there
are
some
real
reason
for
changing
the
posture
of
the
law.
so
far
as
we
can
determine
here
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
that
reason
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
parties
in
--
to
collective-bargaining
agreements
have
apparently
found
that
this
method
of
voluntary
arbitration
picking
arbitrators
with
the
expertise
is
a
desired
way
along
with
the
fact
that
the
federal
labor
law
has
recognized
the
fact
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
for
the
experts
in
this
particular
feel
because
he
run
into
also
it’s
a
complexities
in
a
contract.
we
run
it
to
aspects
of
how
many
people
are
actually
in
the
bargaining
unit?
who
should
have
overtime?
who
shouldn't
have
overtime?
what
does
the
assignment
all
works?
are
these
breaches
of
the
agreement?
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
when
we
talk
about
a
strike
or
a
lockout.
the
arbitrator
may
have
to
determine
whether
in
fact
that
strike
was
a
breach
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
if
we
have
a
lockout,
is
it
a
question
of
a
partial
lockout
or
a
complete
lockout?
we
sometimes
think
in
terms
of
a
lockout
meaning
the
entire
plant
is
shutdown,
nobody
works
but
that
isn’t
necessarily
so.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
if
we
would
do
that
your
honor
and
we
are
talking
about
when
you
say
lockout,
i
assume
that
you're
talking
about
partial
lockout
as
well
as
any
other
type
of
lockout,
then
i
could
mention
that
to
you
very
simply
by
pointing
out
the
difference.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
there
we
have
again
exactly
what
i
was
referring
to
just
on
your
own
comment
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
say
accordance
to
the
contract
whatever
they
are.
this
court
has
said
that
the
person
who
can
best
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
violation
of
that
contract
is
the
arbitrator.
it
is
because
he
works
with
that
--
in
that
field
day
and
night.
he
becomes
the
expert
in
the
field.
the
courts
have
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
type
of
economy
and
the
type
of
labor
management
relations
requires
some
sort
of
expert.
and
admittedly,
this
court
has
said
that
the
courts
do
not
have
that
expertise.
so,
it
isn't
just
a
question
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
alright
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
that
is
true.
but
the
--
in
all
the
cases
some
lincoln
mills,
iron,
and
for
the
steelworks
trilogy,
this
court
has
spoken
in
respect
--
they
were
make
into
distinction
and
talking
about
arbitrators
and
putting
it
in
a
great
weight
upon
the
arbitrator’s
decision
as
oppose
to
the
courts
and
they
were
talking
in
terms
of
injunctive
relief
primarily
when
we
go
back
to
the
fact
where
the
individual
comes
in
with
an
allegation
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
and
asking
for
an
ex
parte
order
in
making
the
allegations
that
this
is
agreed
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
whereas
the
actual
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
requires
--
it
may
require
an
arbitrator
to
decide
and
the
court
doesn’t
really
have
the
time.
if
these
cases
were
open
to
the
courts,
there'd
be
no
use
for
arbitrators
anymore
because
by
the
time
the
parties
come
into
the
court
and
get
their
injunctive
relief
there
is
really
nothing
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
because
we
found
time
and
time
again
that
where
the
injunctive
relief
was
issued
by
a
court
there
really
wasn't
any
problem
for
the
arbitrator
at
that
particular
time.
in
so
far
as
determine
damages
in
a
301
suit
there
is
no
questions
that
the
court
has
to
take
the
evidence
very
much
the
same
of
the
arbitrator.
but
we're
talking
about
matters
relating
to
the
expertise
of
the
arbitrator
and
deferring
to
arbitration
as
such.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
said
from
lincoln
mills
and
iron,
down
that
they
deferred
to
the
arbitrators
and
the
steelworks
trilogy
makes
it
very
clear.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
that's
fine
and
the
arbitrator
can
assess
damages.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
in
this
case
incidentally
has
been
referred
to
arbitration
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
arbitrator
can
assess
damages,
he
can
do
anything.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
it's
a
little
--
it
seems
to
me
that
when
parties
have
agreed
upon
the
set
scope
of
conduct,
and
they
violate
and
they
have
agreed
in
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
any
dispute
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
goes
to
arbitration.
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
now,
if
in
fact
the
strike
is
a
violation
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
the
parties,
the
employer
can
and
did
in
this
case
make
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
that
motion
is
granted.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
is
what
we
bargained
for,
we
did
not
bargain
for
any
type
of
status
quo
situation
and
the
norris-laguardia
makes
it
--
the
act
makes
it
very
clear
that
section
301
in
the
matter
of
collective-bargaining
in
section
301
(b)
speaks
in
terms
of
damages.
now,
i'm
sure
without
knowing
that
counsel
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that
does
happen
by
the
way,
the
longshoremen
have
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
arbitrator
issued
an
injunction?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
his
award
can
say
that
and
if
the
union
fails
to
put
his
man
back
to
work,
the
employer
can
go
to
the
court
for
conformation
of
the
award.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
conceded
that
in
my
brief
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
the
difference
is
that
in
the
arbitrator's
award
the
parties
have
bargained
for
the
arbitration.
the
parties
normally
in
the
arbitration
clause
provide
for
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator's
award
shall
be
a
final
and
binding
award.
if
after
they
have
gone
to
the
procedure
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
one
is
before
the
fact
and
one
is
after
the
fact.
the
matter
of
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
certainly,
to
compel
arbitration.
they've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes
sir,
they've
done
it
many
times.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
let
me
se
whether
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice.
what
is
the
difference
between
the
mandates
for
specific
performance?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
the
--
in
section
301,
of
course
the
federal
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
and
the
dispute
between
a
parties
and
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
parties
have
agreed
by
contract
to
go
to
a
form
being
the
arbitration
voluntarily.
parties
have
infused
to
do
that.
the
court
actually
can
and
does
compel
arbitration,
compel
the
parties
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
which
says
they
have
agreed
upon
a
form
of
adjustment
which
is
quite
different
from
enjoining
the
parties
from
doing
something
else.
the
difference
being
and
as
i
thought
i
mentioned
previously
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
does
not
prevent
the
parties
from
going
to
federal
court
to
seek
compliance
with
their
agreement
to
arbitrate
when
it
does
prevent
the
parties
going
to
federal
court
to
have
the
federal
courts
in
effect
require
them
to
take
certain
conduct
under
their
collective-bargaining
agreement
--
comply
with
conditions
of
that.
that
is
expressly
set
out
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
where
it
says
that
there
can
be
no
federal
district
court
can
issue
an
injunction
against
certain
activities.
this
is
not
one
of
those
activities
expressed
in
norris-laguardia
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
the
power
because
of
norris-laguardia
as
oppose
to
what
we
find
here
in
section
301
in
regard
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
way
i
understand
it
and
that
the
way
the
law
and
the
way
the
courts
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that
is
my
position
mr.
justice
black
that
it's
just
a
matter
of
--
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
statute
where
the
statute
is
clear
and
not
ambiguous.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
change
has
to
be
performed
by
congress
and
not
by
judicial
legislation
so
called.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
as
i
say
i
recognize
the
fact
that
this
court
can
change
its
opinions
in
regard
to
cases.
i
recognize
the
fact
that
they
are
not
necessarily
bound
by
stare
decisis,
but
it
is
my
feeling
that
sinclair
was
an
expression
by
this
court.
not
in
regard
to
a
policy
change
of
a
matter
left
opened
by
congress.
it
seem
to
me
that
what
the
court
said
in
sinclair
what
they
are
deferring
to
congress
and
that
is
that
have
been
clearly
set
forth
by
the
intent
of
congress
that
they're
saying
to
the
parties
that
if
this
has
to
be
changed
then
it
maybe
an
inequity
and
may
be
changed.
the
place
to
get
it
is
not
in
the
courtroom
but
to
get
it
from
congress.
congress
has
failed
to
act
in
this
matter
and
therefore
it
seems
that
there
is
no
other
answer
but
that
without
congress
acting,
we
must
take
the
intent
of
congress
applied
to
law
and
say,
that’s
where
we
stand
today.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
it
was
not
sir.
the
federal
court
read
its
own
injunction
federal
district
court
and
that
was
the
court
i
appealed
to
circuit
court
and
the
circuit
court
reversed
on
the
basis
of
sinclair.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
right.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
think
footnote
4
is
the
reason
we're
here.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
and
i
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
oh!
i
think
the
principle
to
decide
was
sinclair.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
well,
the
way
i
understand
it,
i
may
have
understood
or
think
correctly
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
the
avco
case,
all
the
avco
case
just
cited
was
a
matter
of
procedure
when
a
case
is
removed
to
the
federal
court
from
a
state
court
and
there
is
no
remand.
we
had
remand
before,
but
at
that
point
it
took
care
of
that
problem
and
all
i
did
is
established
in
my
opinion
a
method
of
federal
labor
law
but
isn’t
a
matter
of
forum
shopping
anymore.
once
you
go
into
state
court
and
it's
removed
you
applied
the
federal
labor
law
which
you
should
have
applied
in
the
state
as
well
but
because
norris-laguardia
did
not
speak
to
the
state
we
had
a
different
situation
when
a
case
is
filed
in
the
state
as
oppose
in
federal
law.
but
the
principle
can't
be
any
different
if
in
sinclair
as
this
court
found
the
congress
expressly
set
forth
its
intent
unambiguous
then
the
avco
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
fact
that
the
remedy
may
be
different
because
this
court
happened
to
see
fit,
to
find
an
avco
that
there
would
be
no
remand.
it
seems
that
under
those
circumstances
the
principle
--
underlying
principle
in
sinclair
is
no
different
because
if
the
intent
of
congress
is
so
expressed
that
congress
must
do
something
to
change
the
law
then
i
don't
see
where
avco
is
a
matter
of
procedure
affects
it
at
all.
i
never
did
quite
understand
the
footnote
there
from
the
system.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
i
think.
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
yes,
but
what
i
mean
i
didn't
understand
the
impact
that
avco
might
have
in
regard
to
sinclair
other
than
the
fact
as
we
did
here.
we
removed
the
case
from
the
state
court
to
federal
court
and
they
could
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
that's
right.
and
that's
all
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
schwartz
no,
you're
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
arguing
in
this
case,
it
sounded
as
if
he
was
not
concerned
with
sinclair
but
he’s
unhappy
with
avco.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
his
reply
brief
it
seems
to
me
that
he’s
unhappy
with
the
entire
arbitration
proceeding
because
in
citing
this
one
case
from
we’re
talking
about
picking
arbitration
counsel
points
out
that
the
--
while
the
contract
hold
for
72
hours
and
then
a
12-hour
decision
he
said,
well,
my
god
it
took
four
days
for
hearing.
well,
how
long
it
would
take
if
you
went
to
court,
and
then
the
fact
that
there
was
a
decision
in
december,
the
only
way
that
they
have
a
decision
in
december
if
the
parties
agreed.
so,
i
simply
say
that
by
pointing
to
that
particular
case
in
the
same
quick
the
arbitrations
are
not
the
answer.
i
don't
agree
because
in
the
longshoremen
when
you
have
a
dispute
on
the
dock,
they
have
a
provision
in
their
contract
where
the
arbitrary
comes
right
down
to
the
dock
right
there.
it
says,
go
back
to
work
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
so
there
is
an
answer
to
these
things
and
people
with
the
expertise
in
labor
and
management
can
bargain
for
that.
and
i
failed
to
see
and
where
the
situation
has
changed
from
1962
to
today
as
i
mentioned
previously,
i
can
find
no
legislative
history,
no
legislate
act,
incidentally
legislative
history
in
1962
as
the
same
legislative
history
we
have
today.
so,
under
those
circumstances,
absent
anything
else
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sinclair
case
should
not
be
reversed
and
i
think
that’s
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
