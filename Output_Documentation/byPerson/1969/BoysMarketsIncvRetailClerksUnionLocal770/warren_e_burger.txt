chief

warren
e.
burger
next
case
on
for
argument
is
number
768,
boys
market
against
retail
clerks
union.
mr.
mclaughlin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
the
sinclair
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
it
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
to
statutory
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
based
on
a
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
but
a
statute.
has
it
been
presented
in
congress
to
change
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
try
--
you're
trying
to
get
the
--
a
dissent
in
that
case
of
1962,
reinstated
as
the
law
today
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
filed
or
joined
and
then
request
to
congress
to
change
this
statute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
it
was
construed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
(inaudible)
eight
years
ago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
to
get
it
in
focus,
what
would
happen
if
the
employer
locked
out
the
employees
and
the
union
wanted
to
grant
a
remedy
what
are
their
alternatives,
what
are
their
remedies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now,
doesn't
norris-laguardia
forbid
injunctions
against
both
employers
and
unions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
--
i
know
your
argument
here
that
it
doesn't
but
what
is
the
present
state
of
the
law
under
sinclair?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
sinclair,
could
the
employer
--
could
the
union
get
an
injunction
against
the
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
at
least
as
of
now,
under
sinclair
both
the
employer
and
the
--
and
union
are
in
the
same
posture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
strip
it
away
then.
are
they
in
the
same
posture
in
terms
of
the
enforceability
of
the
no-strike
clause
or
the
no-lockout
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
if
we
overrule
sinclair,
you'd
put
them
again
in
the
same
posture
but
that
they'd
both
have
access,
each
would
have
access
to
the
injunctive
power
of
the
courts
to
compel
arbitration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
could
arbitrate
it,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
you
could
arbitrate
if
both
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
except,
otherwise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
could
get
an
order
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
is
there
any
difference
in
circumstances
or
conditions
with
reference
to
this
case,
now
and
eight
years
ago
when
its
decided
except
that
the
members
of
the
court
have
changed
and
that
the
personnel
is
different
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
any
more
wrong
now
than
it
was
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
of
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
year
was
avco
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
sinclair
created
no
particular
problems
of
consequence
until
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
was
combined
with
avco?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
you
have
no
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you'll
have
three
minutes
left
tomorrow
morning
for
rebuttal
counsel
and
we'll
suspend
now
until
tomorrow
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
soon
as
counsel
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
track
you
on
that
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prevents
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
aren't
both
parties
better
off
if
immediately
from
the
occurring
the
arbitration
process
is
invoked?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
the
status
quo
remains
as
it
is.
they
preserve
the
status
quo
and
go
ahead
to
arbitrate
whatever
issue
it
is,
the
union's
issue
or
the
employer's
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
stay
working
and
no
lockout.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
status
quo
is
effectively
preserve
is
it
not
if
he
is
guaranteed
back
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
of
no-strike
clause,
what's
the
value
of
administrate
clause
in
the
contract
if
the
no-strike
clause
permits
a
strike
on
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
have
that
here,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
wouldn't
it
be
helpful
to
total
of
industrial
peace
if
in
case
of
a
lockout
in
violation
of
the
contract,
the
union
could
go
into
the
federal
courts
and
get
an
injunction
against
that
lockout?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
lockouts
that
are
prohibited
by
the
contract
whatever
they
maybe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
talking
about
the
mechanics
of
it
i'm
familiar
with
the
mechanics.
what's
the
difference
in
principle?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
union
go
into
district
court
and
get
a
directive
whatever
you
might
call
it
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
employer
can
do
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
do
you
distinguish
the
power
to
get
invoke
the
authority
of
the
federal
court
to
compel
one
clause
of
the
contract
but
not
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
specific
performance
equitable
enforcement
isn't
it
whenever
you
invoke
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference
between
a
mandate
for
specific
performance
of
the
no-strike
clause
and
a
mandate
for
the
specific
performance
of
the
arbitration
clause,
in
principle
now,
in
legal
principle?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference
in
the
power
of
a
federal
court
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
to
invoke
the
extra
ordinary
equitable
remedy
to
command
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate
and
the
command
to
fulfill
some
other
clause
of
the
contracts
specifically
by
specific
performance
decree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
want
to
have
your
analysis.[laughter
