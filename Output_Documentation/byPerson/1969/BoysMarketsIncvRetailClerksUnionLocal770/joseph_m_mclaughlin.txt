mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
issue
which
this
court
faced
eight
years
ago
in
sinclair
refining
company
versus
atkinson.
the
question
is
again
here
today
as
well
as
an
additional
questionnaire
to
the
--
was
not
present
in
sinclair.
the
issue
basically
is
whether
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
to
enjoin
strikes
and
work
stoppages
by
labor
organizations
in
violation
of
their
promises
contained
in
their
labor
agreements
not
to
engage
in
strikes
or
work
stoppages
during
the
term
of
the
labor
agreement
and
to
submit
such
disputes
to
arbitration.
this
involves
the
question
as
to
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
be
accommodated
to
section
301
and
held
not
to
bar
the
issuance
of
injunctions
against
strikes
in
breach
or
promise
to
arbitrate
and
not
to
strike.
so
the
continuing
validity
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair
is
squarely
at
issue
here
today.
also,
there's
a
subsidiary
question
and
that
relates
to
the
continued
vitality
of
state
court
injunctions
in
the
federal
court
after
removal
under
avco,
that
is
assuming
that
this
court
finds
that
sinclair
was
rightly
decided.
the
factual
background
is
simple,
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
at
all
times
material
hereto,
were
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
on
that
agreement
provided
in
pertinent
parts
that
all
disputes
involving
in
any
way
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
shall
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
it
further
contained
a
specific
agreement
that
there
would
be
no
strikes,
cessations
of
work,
picketing,
boycotts
or
lockouts
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
it
contained
yet
another
specific
provision
namely
that
matters
subject
to
the
arbitration
procedure
should
be
settled
and
resolved
by
that
established
procedure.
the
employer
operates
a
chain
of
some
35
supermarkets.
on
a
particular
day
in
1969,
the
employer
was
utilizing
some
non-union
--
some
non-bargaining
unit
personnel
to
stock
a
frozen
food
case.
a
union
business
agent
observed
this
and
objected,
demanded
that
the
employer
cease.
the
employer
believing
that
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
contract
refused.
the
union
called
a
strike.
all
the
employees
left
the
store.
picketing
commenced.
the
customers
were
told
that
the
store
has
closed.
there
is
no
service.
pickets
carried
signs
saying,
“local
770,
this
store
on
strike,
please
respect
our
picket
lines.”
the
employer
demanded
arbitration.
the
union
refused
and
continued
to
picket.
the
employer
went
to
the
superior
court,
county
of
los
angeles
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
also
an
order
to
show
cause
by
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
now
in
connection
with
this
state
court
procedure,
union
counsel
was
notified
as
provided
by
local
court
rule
after
argument
in
chambers
in
consideration
of
the
verified
complaints,
the
affidavits
and
the
likes,
the
order
was
issued.
now
the
temporary
restraining
order
enjoined
the
work
stoppage.
the
union
responded
promptly
by
removing
the
case
to
the
federal
court
and
in
the
federal
court
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order.
in
opposition,
the
employer
filed
in
the
federal
court
a
motion
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration
for
an
order
requiring
specific
performance
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
strike.
now
the
district
judge
was
well
aware
of
avco
and
was
well
aware
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair.
and
after
consideration
of
the
arguments
of
the
parties
in
the
various
documents
submitted,
he
denied
the
union's
motion
to
quash
the
state
court
injunction.
he
granted
the
employer's
motion
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration
in
enjoining
the
work
stoppage.
the
union
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
ground
of
sinclair.
now
your
honors,
the
underlying
premise
of
the
trilogy
in
lincoln
mills
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
developed
under
section
301
is
that
arbitration
is
the
most
favorable
solution,
the
most
feasible
solution
to
industrial
warfare.
adjudication
on
the
merits
is
to
be
substituted
for
muscle.
this
court
has
said
that
the
no
strike
agreement
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
employer's
agreement
to
arbitrate.
now,
if
unions
are
free
to
strike
and
the
employer
is
bound
to
arbitrate,
this
does
not
only
mean
that
the
employer
doesn't
receive
his
bargain,
the
benefit
of
this
bargain
which
is
really
about
the
only
thing
an
employer
gets
from
a
labor
agreement
but
also
most
serious
imbalance
results.
this
court
has
said
that
arbitration
is
the
kingpin
of
the
federal
labor
policy
under
section
301.
well,
the
kingpin
is
destroyed
by
the
strike
in
breach
of
contract
where
the
union
is
obligated
to
arbitrate
the
underlying
union.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
1962
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
your
honor
it
was
a
decision
of
the
--
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
in
sinclair,
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
correct
sir,
yes
because
i
believe
the
dissent
was
correct.
the
decision
of
1962
is
simply
out
of
harmony
with
the
congressional
policy
which
this
court
has
found
in
section
301
that
is
that
the
federal
courts
under
section
301
are
to
develop
a
body
of
federal
labor
law.
and
as
i'm
pointing
out
before,
arbitration
has
been
declared
to
be
the
kingpin
of
that
policy.
now
the
objection
at
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbids
what
almost
every
commentator
what
agrees
is
necessary
and
desirable
is
simply
not
sound
because
you
can
adopt,
you
can
accommodate
section
301,
norris-laguardia
act
so
as
to
give
the
fullest
possible
effect
to
the
central
purpose
of
those
statutes.
the
courts
done
this
before,
it's
done
in
--
on
the
field
of
antitrust.
justice
frankfurter
writing
for
the
court
accommodated
norris-laguardia
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
hutcheson
case.
in
chicago
river,
this
court
accommodated
section
301
with
the
railway
labor
act
and
i
submit
that
in
lincoln
mills
this
court
likewise
accommodated
the
norris-laguardia
act
with
section
301.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
your
honor
neither
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
neither
i
nor
anyone
i
represent
has
opposed
the
congress
on
this
matter
sir.
now,
no
viable
distinction,
it
seems
to
me
at
least
can
be
made
between
the
accommodation
of
chicago
river
and
the
failure
to
accommodate
in
sinclair
with
section
301.
the
only
distinction
is
that
in
chicago
river
the
arbitrator
was
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
and
here
under
taft-hartley
section
301,
it's
an
arbitrator
who
was
selected
through
the
contractually
agreed
upon
procedures.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
that
was
asked
or
the
question
rather
that
was
stated
in
the
court's
opinion
in
sinclair
was
the
wrong
question.
the
opinion
of
the
court
starts
off
stating
the
question
as
being
whether
section
301
and
i
believe
the
phrase
used
is
“impliedly
repealed”
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
obviously
no.
i
think
the
proper
question,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
should
be
accommodated
to
each
other
and
i
think
the
answer
there
is
just
as
obvious
and
its
yes.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
obviously
your
honor
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
it
is
the
function
of
the
court
to
determine
arbitrability.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that
would
--
that's
undoubtedly
the
case
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
can't
think
of
any
at
the
moment
your
honor,
there
would
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
in
unfair
labor
practice
strike
of
course
that's
something
else
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
because
unless
an
agreement
specifically
confides
the
question
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrator.
it
is
the
court's
function
to
determine
arbitrability.
now,
in
determining
arbitrability,
you
have
to
interpret
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
it's
not
unusual
on
contracts
for
matters
to
be
accepted
from
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
now
likewise
with
respect
to
a
no-strike
clause,
it
seems
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
this
particular
contract
expired
was
replaced
after
a
strike
by
a
successor
contract.
the
language
of
this
section
and
the
language
of
the
contract
which
relates
to
and
which
would
have
anything
with
the
issues
before
this
court
are
identical.
they
haven't
been
changed
they
are
enforced
in
effect.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
there's
no
--
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
at
all
and
union
counsel
for
example
will
not
deny
one
that
there
was
a
labor
agreement
at
certain
points
to
the
language
of
the
no-strike
clause.
if
you're
--
as
is
clear
as
language
can
possibly
be
and
it
would
be
extremely
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
under
this
contract
and
under
similar
contracts,
if
the
union
business
agent
had
come
in
the
store
and
he
had
said,
"you're
improperly
stocking
the
frozen
food
cases,
it's
a
violation."
and
the
employer
had
said
it
is
not
and
you
better
forget
about
it
and
then
the
union
business
agent
refused
to
it,
and
then
the
employer
lock
the
people
out
or
something
like
that.
then
the
union
could
have
gone
to
court
under
this
contract
and
under
the
law
as
i
think
it
is
and
should
be,
could
have
gone
to
court
and
could
have
obtained
a
restraining
order
against
the
employer.
in
fact,
i
would
stipulate
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
it
most
certainly
does
sir
but
i
don't
that
norris-laguardia
forbids
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
under
sin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
they're
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
getting
the
injunction
but
they're
not
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
the
objectives
of
arbitration
and
with
respect
to
what
the
real
meaning
of
the
situation.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
legally
speaking
in
terms
of
their
right
to
access
to
the
court
or
lack
of
right,
they
are
the
in
same
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
as
i
to
start
to
say
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
doesn't
indicate
the
congressional
disapproval
of
this
accommodation
that
we're
suggesting
here
today.
in
sinclair
this
court
read
more
into
that
legislative
history
than
it
can
properly
bear.
justice
frankfurter
and
his
dissent
in
lincoln
mills
i
believe
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
leaves
us
in
the
dark.
in
lincoln
mills,
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
was
cloudy
and
confusing.
one
thing,
lincoln
mills
did
said
about
that
legislative
history
though
was
that
congress
interested
in
promoting
collective
bargaining
that
ended
with
the
agreements
not
to
strike.
now,
if
congress
was
interested
in
promoting
collective
bargaining
that
ended
with
agreements
not
to
strike,
the
enforcement
of
those
agreement
or
the
enforcement
of
those
agreements
must
be
provided
for
so
as
to
make
them
meaningful
because
one
thing
congress
obviously
wasn't
doing,
it
obviously
wasn't
engaging
in
an
idle
exercise
to
encourage
people
to
make
agreements
which
were
meaningless
in
practical
effect.
if
arbitration
is
going
to
work,
the
federal
scheme
must
permit
the
effectuation
of
labor
policy
in
the
field
of
arbitration
by
means
of
the
injunction
against
the
strike
and
breach
of
contract.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
this
is
not
necessary.
it's
been
suggested
that
there
are
other
and
alternative
ways
to
handle
this
problem.
for
example,
the
remedy
of
damages
has
been
suggested.
well,
damages
as
a
remedy
against
a
union,
your
honors,
if
i
can
bring
15
years
of
intimate
experience
about
it
to
bear,
damages
against
a
union
with
whom
a
--
an
employer
has
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
are
meaningless.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
first
of
all,
to
arbitrate
in
the
face
of
a
strike
is
difficult.
secondly,
a
strike
defeats
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction.
and
thirdly,
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
a
strike.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
jurisdiction
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
the
--
his
ability
to
consider
the
matter
on
the
merits
to
adjudicate
the
thing
sanely
and
in
a
civilize
fashion
is
defeated
because,
your
honor,
the
employer
in
this
case
over
who
was
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
yes
but
in
this
case
for
example,
if
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
another
point.
if
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
but
only
--
that's
my
point;
we
should
be
able
to
get
an
order
to
arbitrate.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes.
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
alright.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
don't
know
what
their
position
would
be
with
respect
to
that.
i
have
three
comments
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
with
respect
what
would've
happen
here,
the
dispute
involved
the
propriety
of
the
way
a
frozen
food
case
was
being
stocked
or
rather
a
large
frozen
food
case
but
nevertheless
that.
now,
the
collective
bargainingship
--
relationship
or
the
collective-bargaining
relationship
with
these
parties
is
made
up
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
disputes
like
this
over
the
years.
now,
if
the
employer
in
this
case
had
to
wait
while
somebody
got
an
order
to
arbitrate
and
then
had
arbitration
hearing
and
then
came
back
with
an
order
and
that
leaves
still
unanswered
your
honor
the
question
of
the
courts
ability
to
specifically
enforce
the
award
of
the
arbitrator.
that's
a
question
that
came
up
in
new
orleans
steamship
and
the
philadelphia
marine.
in
any
event,
my
employer
in
this
case,
it
isn't
worth
it.
he's
loss
the
benefit
of
his
bargain.
he
can't
have
a
store
shutdown
with
the
enormous
overhead
of
a
modern
supermarket
for
a
period
of
two
or
three
months
while
an
arbitrator
decides
a
dispute.
it
has
defeated
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitrator.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
absolutely
and
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
the
point
is
that
this
things
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no
sir,
we
do
not
and
i
do
not
think
we
should
have
to.
now
i'd
be
glad
to
explain
why,
if
i
may.
the
reason
is
this,
is
that
when
the
arbitrator
renders
his
award
and
he
says
for
example
that
that
the
employee
was
wrongly
discharged
that
employee
can
be
made
whole
because
he
is
awarded
reinstatement,
he
is
awarded
back
pay.
whatever
happened
can
be
quite
readily
remedied.
now
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract
is
something
of
an
entirely
different
order.
it's
not
the
same
thing
at
all.
and
so
that's
why
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
there's
--
an
inequality
as
your
honor
at
least
to
me
seem
to
be
suggesting.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
can
throw
some
light
on
it
from
my
own
experience.
i
personally
do
not
think
that
at
least
in
the
areas
where
i
have
practiced
that
sinclair
itself
has
had
much
in
effect
at
all
until
avco
came
along.
but
you
see,
that
was
because
for
example
in
the
southern
district
of
california
which
is
now
the
central
in
the
south
district,
the
courts
there
refused
to
accept
removed
cases
from
the
superior
court.
now,
the
gimmick
in
combination,
sinclair
and
avco,
you
see,
we
removed
the
case
from
the
superior
court
and
the
anomaly
of
that
is
and
congress
could
never
have
intended
this,
that
an
employer
actually
ends
up
with
lesser
means
of
effectuating
his
rights
under
the
contract
than
he
had
before
section
301
and
this
i
--
i'm
--
i
don't
think
anyone
could
say
they
were
intended.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
i
think
a
number
a
things
have
happened
to
change
it.
for
example,
first
of
all
as
i
made
it
plain,
i
think
the
decision
was
wrong
and
if
it
was
--
if
i'm
correct
sir
i
may
respectfully
suggest
if
it
was
wrong
then,
it's
likely
to
be
just
as
wrong
today.
secondly,
if
i
may
say
so
with
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
believe
it
is
because
of
avco.
you
see
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
avco.
you
see
previously
as
it
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
in
the
avco
case,
your
honor.
it
was
concerning
the
right
of
removal
from
state
courts
to
federal
courts
of
section
301
actions.
see,
what
actually
happened
was
and
this
is
the
other
anomaly
if
i
may
say
so.
that
here
we
have
a
situation
where
i
suppose
that,
your
honors
don't
agree
with
me
and
that
sinclair
remains
with
continued
vitality
and
then
you
put
it
together
with
avco
then
we
come
up
with
this
next
question.
alright,
then
we
have
to
decide
or
rather
this
court
has
to
decide
what
effect
does
norris-laguardia
have
on
state
courts.
what
is
the
effect
upon
an
injunction
issued
by
a
state
court
after
it's
been
removed
to
the
federal
court?
does
norris-laguardia
command
that
order
be
dissolved?
if
not
then
the
anomalous
situation
arises
of
having
section
301
under
which
the
federal
court
system
was
to
create
a
body
of
federal
law
of
having
results
that
have
forced
plaintiffs
into
state
courts
where
state
courts
would
do
the
body
of
301
business
under
section
301.
and
then
the
other
side
of
it
if
you
say,
“well,
norris-laguardia
will
require
those
injunctions
to
be
dissolved.”
as
i've
said
before,
an
employer
has
less
ways
of
effectuating
his
agreement
than
he
had
before
301,
that's
not
right.
and
then
thirdly,
if
you
say,
“well,
state
courts
are
bound
by
norris-laguardia.”
and
we
know
we
can't
say
that
from
norris-laguardia.
we
would
have
to
import
through
an
interpretation
of
section
301.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
avco,
i
believe
was
1969
or
1968,
your
honor.
it's
a
rather
recent
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
i
think
sin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
think
sinclair
probably
created
or
gave
rise
to
serious
problems
of
difficulties.
for
example
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
states
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes
or
in
states
where
they
have
anti-injunction
acts
that
might
have
been
interpreted
to
not
give
this
relief.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
sir
that
sinclair
had
not
given
rise
to
difficulties.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
whatever
difficulties
sinclair
gave
rise
to,
they
have
been
terrifically
increased
with
the
decision
in
avco.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
to
my
knowledge
sir
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
passed
any
resolutions
or
enacted
any
statutes
that
would
indicate
a
complaint
however
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
this
court
has
interpreted
statutes
in
various
ways.
for
example,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
lincoln
mills
as
you
most
certainly
have,
not
lincoln
mills
of
section
301,
we
find
in
there
practically
no
mention
of
arbitration.
now
what
i
think
happened
here
is
likewise
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
the
court
in
interpreting
the
statute
found
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
said,
“in
interpreting
the
statute
the
court
found
it.”
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
you
don't
find
very
much
and
also
in
looking
at
the
wording
of
301,
you
don't
find
too
much.
now,
my
point
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
sir
i
don't
know
and
i
can't
agree
that
that's
correct,
that
is
if
your
assumptions
are
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
--
what
--
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
saying,
i
can't
agree
that
there
would
be
a
change
simply
because
the
composition
of
the
court
has
changed?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
said
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
--
the
same
justices
could
conceivably
have
come
to
the
conclusion
and
this
court
has
done
this
before.
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
something
incorrectly
some
years
ago
and
rectify
it.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unusual
about
that
either
in
the
--
our
legal
system
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
your
honor
it's
been
done
lately
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
now
another
thing
that's
been
suggested
is
that
discipline
is
a
means
of
controlling
this.
sir,
you
can't
fire
your
whole
warehouse
crew.
i
don't
have
enough
time
to
dwell
on
these
things.
its
illusion,
it's
a
snare.
disciplining
employees
doesn't
do
any
good
because
you
need
them.
you're
in
business
to
produce
goods
or
to
sell
goods
as
the
case
may
be.
next,
they
talk
about
quickie
arbitrations.
quickie
arbitrations
are
misnomer,
they're
an
illusion,
the
best
illustration
of
that,
we
covered
it
in
our
reply
brief,
the
best
illustration
of
it
though
is
to
be
found
in
the
new
orleans
steamship
case
where
they
had
a
quickie
arbitration
procedure,
quickie,
yes.
the
hearing
lasted
for
four
days
and
the
decision
didn't
come
out
until
over
two
months
later.
now,
in
summary
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
your
honor,
you
don't
understand
me
or
if
you
do
understand
me
to
be
saying
that
you
misunderstand
me.
what
i'm
saying
sir
is
that
there
has
been
a
suggestion
particularly
in
the
brief
of
afl-cio
amicus
that
perhaps
a
proper
substitute
would
be
the
negotiation
of
so-called
quickie
arbitration
provisions
and
we've
been
at
some
pains
in
reply
brief
to
point
out
why
this
isn't
so
and
i
was
just
in
my
argument
passing
by
and
adverting
to
that
fact
sir.
in
any
event
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
sinclair
was
wrongly
decided
and
as
i
say,
we
think
it
should
be
reversed.
and
i
pointed
out
what
i
think
or
the
really
the
thorny
thicket
that
--
i
mean
this
business
of
really
painting
the
court
and
the
profession
and
the
law
into
a
corner
if
we
continue
down
this
path
because
of
the
fact
that
we
now
have
to
decide
if
sinclair
remains
viable,
we
have
to
decide
what
we
are
going
to
do
about
remove
state
court
injunctions.
we
get
by
that,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
the
power
of
state
courts
to
issue
injunctions
particularly,
well
for
some
reason
they
aren't
removed.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
a
proper
accommodation
of
norris-laguardia
and
section
301
sanctions
the
injunction
in
this
case,
it's
a
vital
part
of
section
301's
effectuation.
i
would
say
that
the
availability
of
the
injunction
is
far
more
necessary
to
section
301
than
it
is
detrimental
to
norris-laguardia
and
therefore
its
respectfully
submitted
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
with
instructions
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
very
brief
time
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
make
two
or
three
points.
first
of
all,
with
reference
to
the
statements
and
the
contentions
that
have
been
made
on
account
of
the
failure
of
congress
to
act
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
sinclair
and
also
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
sinclair
is
some
kind
of
a
stare
decisis
impact.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
decision
of
this
court
which
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
we
didn't
cover
this
point
helvering
versus
hallock
this
case
is
to
be
found
in
309
u.s.
106.
the
decision
in
the
case
was
offered
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
stone,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
mr.
justice
murphy.
on
page
118
of
the
official
report
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
would
just
like
to
read
three
or
four
sentences.
this
case
involved
a
situation
where
there
had
been
three
different
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
a
tax
matter
and
the
court
was
faced
with
the
question
as
to
whether
it
should
further
proliferate
these
decisions
or
whether
it
should
just
take
the
three
decisions
that
come
on
before
and
in
fact
overturn
them.
“our
real
problem,
therefore,
is
to
determine
whether
we
are
to
adhere
to
a
harmonizing
principle
in
the
construction
of
302
(c),
or
whether
we
are
to
multiply
gossamer
distinctions
between
the
present
cases
and
the
three
earlier
cases.”
now,
skipping
your
honor,
“we
recognize
that
stare
decisis
embodies
an
important
social
policy.
it
represents
an
element
of
continuity
in
and
law
and
it’s
rooted
in
the
psychologic
need
to
satisfy
reasonable
expectations.
but
stare
decisis
is
a
principle
policy
and
not
a
mechanical
formula
of
adherence
to
the
latest
decision,
however
recent
and
questionable,
where
such
adherence
involves
collision
with
a
prior
doctrine
more
embracing
in
its
scope,
intrinsically
sounder
and
verified
by
experience.”
skipping
now
for
one
more
sentence
to
what
would
be
page
121
of
the
official
reporter.
“this
court,
unlike
the
house
of
lords,
has
from
the
beginning
rejected
the
doctrine
of
disability
and
self-correction.
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
want
to
congressional
action
to
modify
by
legislation
the
result
from
the
st.
louis
trust
cases,
it
will
hardly
be
urged
that
the
reason
was
congressional
approval
of
these
distinctions”
and
then
the
court
goes
on.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor.
helvering
versus
hallock
it’s
to
be
found
at
--
in
the
official
reporter
as
i
said
at
309
u.s.
106.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
309.
now,
also
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
the
decision
of
girouard
versus
united
states
328
u.s.
61.
the
first
case
i
cited
i
believe
was
a
1940
case.
this
is
a
1946
case.
this
involved
a
matter
arising
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
opinion
in
that
case
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
murphy,
mr.
justice
rutledge
and
mr.
justice
burger.
one
sentence
from
that
case
if
i
might
please
once
again
a
prior
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
321
u.s.
61
your
honor.
one
sentence,
“it
is,
at
best,
treacherous
to
find
in
congressional
silence
alone
the
adoption
of
a
controlling
rule
of
law.”
now,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
and
so
i
can't
make
some
of
the
other
points
i'd
like
to
make
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
only
remedy
that’s
going
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
section
301
is
going
to
be
the
availability
of
the
injunction
against
the
strike
in
breach
of
contract.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh!
one
thing
your
honors
if
i
might,
i
apologize.
i
will
direct
your
attention
with
respect
to
this
idea
about
equality
to
section
2
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief.
we
have
covered
this
so
called
imbalance
situation
and
i
would
ask
you
to
read
it
with
some
care.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
issue
which
this
court
faced
eight
years
ago
in
sinclair
refining
company
versus
atkinson.
the
question
is
again
here
today
as
well
as
an
additional
questionnaire
to
the
--
was
not
present
in
sinclair.
the
issue
basically
is
whether
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
to
enjoin
strikes
and
work
stoppages
by
labor
organizations
in
violation
of
their
promises
contained
in
their
labor
agreements
not
to
engage
in
strikes
or
work
stoppages
during
the
term
of
the
labor
agreement
and
to
submit
such
disputes
to
arbitration.
this
involves
the
question
as
to
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
should
be
accommodated
to
section
301
and
held
not
to
bar
the
issuance
of
injunctions
against
strikes
in
breach
or
promise
to
arbitrate
and
not
to
strike.
so
the
continuing
validity
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair
is
squarely
at
issue
here
today.
also,
there's
a
subsidiary
question
and
that
relates
to
the
continued
vitality
of
state
court
injunctions
in
the
federal
court
after
removal
under
avco,
that
is
assuming
that
this
court
finds
that
sinclair
was
rightly
decided.
the
factual
background
is
simple,
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
at
all
times
material
hereto,
were
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
on
that
agreement
provided
in
pertinent
parts
that
all
disputes
involving
in
any
way
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
shall
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
it
further
contained
a
specific
agreement
that
there
would
be
no
strikes,
cessations
of
work,
picketing,
boycotts
or
lockouts
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
it
contained
yet
another
specific
provision
namely
that
matters
subject
to
the
arbitration
procedure
should
be
settled
and
resolved
by
that
established
procedure.
the
employer
operates
a
chain
of
some
35
supermarkets.
on
a
particular
day
in
1969,
the
employer
was
utilizing
some
non-union
--
some
non-bargaining
unit
personnel
to
stock
a
frozen
food
case.
a
union
business
agent
observed
this
and
objected,
demanded
that
the
employer
cease.
the
employer
believing
that
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
contract
refused.
the
union
called
a
strike.
all
the
employees
left
the
store.
picketing
commenced.
the
customers
were
told
that
the
store
has
closed.
there
is
no
service.
pickets
carried
signs
saying,
“local
770,
this
store
on
strike,
please
respect
our
picket
lines.”
the
employer
demanded
arbitration.
the
union
refused
and
continued
to
picket.
the
employer
went
to
the
superior
court,
county
of
los
angeles
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
also
an
order
to
show
cause
by
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
now
in
connection
with
this
state
court
procedure,
union
counsel
was
notified
as
provided
by
local
court
rule
after
argument
in
chambers
in
consideration
of
the
verified
complaints,
the
affidavits
and
the
likes,
the
order
was
issued.
now
the
temporary
restraining
order
enjoined
the
work
stoppage.
the
union
responded
promptly
by
removing
the
case
to
the
federal
court
and
in
the
federal
court
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order.
in
opposition,
the
employer
filed
in
the
federal
court
a
motion
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration
for
an
order
requiring
specific
performance
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
strike.
now
the
district
judge
was
well
aware
of
avco
and
was
well
aware
of
this
court's
decision
in
sinclair.
and
after
consideration
of
the
arguments
of
the
parties
in
the
various
documents
submitted,
he
denied
the
union's
motion
to
quash
the
state
court
injunction.
he
granted
the
employer's
motion
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration
in
enjoining
the
work
stoppage.
the
union
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
ground
of
sinclair.
now
your
honors,
the
underlying
premise
of
the
trilogy
in
lincoln
mills
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
developed
under
section
301
is
that
arbitration
is
the
most
favorable
solution,
the
most
feasible
solution
to
industrial
warfare.
adjudication
on
the
merits
is
to
be
substituted
for
muscle.
this
court
has
said
that
the
no
strike
agreement
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
employer's
agreement
to
arbitrate.
now,
if
unions
are
free
to
strike
and
the
employer
is
bound
to
arbitrate,
this
does
not
only
mean
that
the
employer
doesn't
receive
his
bargain,
the
benefit
of
this
bargain
which
is
really
about
the
only
thing
an
employer
gets
from
a
labor
agreement
but
also
most
serious
imbalance
results.
this
court
has
said
that
arbitration
is
the
kingpin
of
the
federal
labor
policy
under
section
301.
well,
the
kingpin
is
destroyed
by
the
strike
in
breach
of
contract
where
the
union
is
obligated
to
arbitrate
the
underlying
union.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
1962
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
your
honor
it
was
a
decision
of
the
--
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
in
sinclair,
this
court
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
correct
sir,
yes
because
i
believe
the
dissent
was
correct.
the
decision
of
1962
is
simply
out
of
harmony
with
the
congressional
policy
which
this
court
has
found
in
section
301
that
is
that
the
federal
courts
under
section
301
are
to
develop
a
body
of
federal
labor
law.
and
as
i'm
pointing
out
before,
arbitration
has
been
declared
to
be
the
kingpin
of
that
policy.
now
the
objection
at
the
norris-laguardia
act
forbids
what
almost
every
commentator
what
agrees
is
necessary
and
desirable
is
simply
not
sound
because
you
can
adopt,
you
can
accommodate
section
301,
norris-laguardia
act
so
as
to
give
the
fullest
possible
effect
to
the
central
purpose
of
those
statutes.
the
courts
done
this
before,
it's
done
in
--
on
the
field
of
antitrust.
justice
frankfurter
writing
for
the
court
accommodated
norris-laguardia
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
hutcheson
case.
in
chicago
river,
this
court
accommodated
section
301
with
the
railway
labor
act
and
i
submit
that
in
lincoln
mills
this
court
likewise
accommodated
the
norris-laguardia
act
with
section
301.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
hear
you?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
your
honor
neither
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
neither
i
nor
anyone
i
represent
has
opposed
the
congress
on
this
matter
sir.
now,
no
viable
distinction,
it
seems
to
me
at
least
can
be
made
between
the
accommodation
of
chicago
river
and
the
failure
to
accommodate
in
sinclair
with
section
301.
the
only
distinction
is
that
in
chicago
river
the
arbitrator
was
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
and
here
under
taft-hartley
section
301,
it's
an
arbitrator
who
was
selected
through
the
contractually
agreed
upon
procedures.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
that
was
asked
or
the
question
rather
that
was
stated
in
the
court's
opinion
in
sinclair
was
the
wrong
question.
the
opinion
of
the
court
starts
off
stating
the
question
as
being
whether
section
301
and
i
believe
the
phrase
used
is
“impliedly
repealed”
section
4
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
obviously
no.
i
think
the
proper
question,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
should
be
accommodated
to
each
other
and
i
think
the
answer
there
is
just
as
obvious
and
its
yes.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
obviously
your
honor
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
it
is
the
function
of
the
court
to
determine
arbitrability.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that
would
--
that's
undoubtedly
the
case
because,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
can't
think
of
any
at
the
moment
your
honor,
there
would
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
in
unfair
labor
practice
strike
of
course
that's
something
else
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
because
unless
an
agreement
specifically
confides
the
question
arbitrability
to
the
arbitrator.
it
is
the
court's
function
to
determine
arbitrability.
now,
in
determining
arbitrability,
you
have
to
interpret
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
it's
not
unusual
on
contracts
for
matters
to
be
accepted
from
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
now
likewise
with
respect
to
a
no-strike
clause,
it
seems
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
this
particular
contract
expired
was
replaced
after
a
strike
by
a
successor
contract.
the
language
of
this
section
and
the
language
of
the
contract
which
relates
to
and
which
would
have
anything
with
the
issues
before
this
court
are
identical.
they
haven't
been
changed
they
are
enforced
in
effect.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
there's
no
--
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
at
all
and
union
counsel
for
example
will
not
deny
one
that
there
was
a
labor
agreement
at
certain
points
to
the
language
of
the
no-strike
clause.
if
you're
--
as
is
clear
as
language
can
possibly
be
and
it
would
be
extremely
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
under
this
contract
and
under
similar
contracts,
if
the
union
business
agent
had
come
in
the
store
and
he
had
said,
"you're
improperly
stocking
the
frozen
food
cases,
it's
a
violation."
and
the
employer
had
said
it
is
not
and
you
better
forget
about
it
and
then
the
union
business
agent
refused
to
it,
and
then
the
employer
lock
the
people
out
or
something
like
that.
then
the
union
could
have
gone
to
court
under
this
contract
and
under
the
law
as
i
think
it
is
and
should
be,
could
have
gone
to
court
and
could
have
obtained
a
restraining
order
against
the
employer.
in
fact,
i
would
stipulate
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
it
most
certainly
does
sir
but
i
don't
that
norris-laguardia
forbids
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
under
sin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
they're
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
getting
the
injunction
but
they're
not
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
the
objectives
of
arbitration
and
with
respect
to
what
the
real
meaning
of
the
situation.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
legally
speaking
in
terms
of
their
right
to
access
to
the
court
or
lack
of
right,
they
are
the
in
same
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
as
i
to
start
to
say
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
doesn't
indicate
the
congressional
disapproval
of
this
accommodation
that
we're
suggesting
here
today.
in
sinclair
this
court
read
more
into
that
legislative
history
than
it
can
properly
bear.
justice
frankfurter
and
his
dissent
in
lincoln
mills
i
believe
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
leaves
us
in
the
dark.
in
lincoln
mills,
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
301
was
cloudy
and
confusing.
one
thing,
lincoln
mills
did
said
about
that
legislative
history
though
was
that
congress
interested
in
promoting
collective
bargaining
that
ended
with
the
agreements
not
to
strike.
now,
if
congress
was
interested
in
promoting
collective
bargaining
that
ended
with
agreements
not
to
strike,
the
enforcement
of
those
agreement
or
the
enforcement
of
those
agreements
must
be
provided
for
so
as
to
make
them
meaningful
because
one
thing
congress
obviously
wasn't
doing,
it
obviously
wasn't
engaging
in
an
idle
exercise
to
encourage
people
to
make
agreements
which
were
meaningless
in
practical
effect.
if
arbitration
is
going
to
work,
the
federal
scheme
must
permit
the
effectuation
of
labor
policy
in
the
field
of
arbitration
by
means
of
the
injunction
against
the
strike
and
breach
of
contract.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
this
is
not
necessary.
it's
been
suggested
that
there
are
other
and
alternative
ways
to
handle
this
problem.
for
example,
the
remedy
of
damages
has
been
suggested.
well,
damages
as
a
remedy
against
a
union,
your
honors,
if
i
can
bring
15
years
of
intimate
experience
about
it
to
bear,
damages
against
a
union
with
whom
a
--
an
employer
has
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
are
meaningless.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
first
of
all,
to
arbitrate
in
the
face
of
a
strike
is
difficult.
secondly,
a
strike
defeats
the
arbitrator's
jurisdiction.
and
thirdly,
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
a
strike.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
jurisdiction
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
the
--
his
ability
to
consider
the
matter
on
the
merits
to
adjudicate
the
thing
sanely
and
in
a
civilize
fashion
is
defeated
because,
your
honor,
the
employer
in
this
case
over
who
was
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
yes
but
in
this
case
for
example,
if
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
that's
another
point.
if
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
but
only
--
that's
my
point;
we
should
be
able
to
get
an
order
to
arbitrate.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes.
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
alright.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
don't
know
what
their
position
would
be
with
respect
to
that.
i
have
three
comments
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
with
respect
what
would've
happen
here,
the
dispute
involved
the
propriety
of
the
way
a
frozen
food
case
was
being
stocked
or
rather
a
large
frozen
food
case
but
nevertheless
that.
now,
the
collective
bargainingship
--
relationship
or
the
collective-bargaining
relationship
with
these
parties
is
made
up
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
disputes
like
this
over
the
years.
now,
if
the
employer
in
this
case
had
to
wait
while
somebody
got
an
order
to
arbitrate
and
then
had
arbitration
hearing
and
then
came
back
with
an
order
and
that
leaves
still
unanswered
your
honor
the
question
of
the
courts
ability
to
specifically
enforce
the
award
of
the
arbitrator.
that's
a
question
that
came
up
in
new
orleans
steamship
and
the
philadelphia
marine.
in
any
event,
my
employer
in
this
case,
it
isn't
worth
it.
he's
loss
the
benefit
of
his
bargain.
he
can't
have
a
store
shutdown
with
the
enormous
overhead
of
a
modern
supermarket
for
a
period
of
two
or
three
months
while
an
arbitrator
decides
a
dispute.
it
has
defeated
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitrator.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
absolutely
and
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
the
point
is
that
this
things
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no
sir,
we
do
not
and
i
do
not
think
we
should
have
to.
now
i'd
be
glad
to
explain
why,
if
i
may.
the
reason
is
this,
is
that
when
the
arbitrator
renders
his
award
and
he
says
for
example
that
that
the
employee
was
wrongly
discharged
that
employee
can
be
made
whole
because
he
is
awarded
reinstatement,
he
is
awarded
back
pay.
whatever
happened
can
be
quite
readily
remedied.
now
a
strike
in
breach
of
contract
is
something
of
an
entirely
different
order.
it's
not
the
same
thing
at
all.
and
so
that's
why
your
honor
i
don't
think
that
there's
--
an
inequality
as
your
honor
at
least
to
me
seem
to
be
suggesting.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
can
throw
some
light
on
it
from
my
own
experience.
i
personally
do
not
think
that
at
least
in
the
areas
where
i
have
practiced
that
sinclair
itself
has
had
much
in
effect
at
all
until
avco
came
along.
but
you
see,
that
was
because
for
example
in
the
southern
district
of
california
which
is
now
the
central
in
the
south
district,
the
courts
there
refused
to
accept
removed
cases
from
the
superior
court.
now,
the
gimmick
in
combination,
sinclair
and
avco,
you
see,
we
removed
the
case
from
the
superior
court
and
the
anomaly
of
that
is
and
congress
could
never
have
intended
this,
that
an
employer
actually
ends
up
with
lesser
means
of
effectuating
his
rights
under
the
contract
than
he
had
before
section
301
and
this
i
--
i'm
--
i
don't
think
anyone
could
say
they
were
intended.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
i
think
a
number
a
things
have
happened
to
change
it.
for
example,
first
of
all
as
i
made
it
plain,
i
think
the
decision
was
wrong
and
if
it
was
--
if
i'm
correct
sir
i
may
respectfully
suggest
if
it
was
wrong
then,
it's
likely
to
be
just
as
wrong
today.
secondly,
if
i
may
say
so
with
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
believe
it
is
because
of
avco.
you
see
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
avco.
you
see
previously
as
it
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
in
the
avco
case,
your
honor.
it
was
concerning
the
right
of
removal
from
state
courts
to
federal
courts
of
section
301
actions.
see,
what
actually
happened
was
and
this
is
the
other
anomaly
if
i
may
say
so.
that
here
we
have
a
situation
where
i
suppose
that,
your
honors
don't
agree
with
me
and
that
sinclair
remains
with
continued
vitality
and
then
you
put
it
together
with
avco
then
we
come
up
with
this
next
question.
alright,
then
we
have
to
decide
or
rather
this
court
has
to
decide
what
effect
does
norris-laguardia
have
on
state
courts.
what
is
the
effect
upon
an
injunction
issued
by
a
state
court
after
it's
been
removed
to
the
federal
court?
does
norris-laguardia
command
that
order
be
dissolved?
if
not
then
the
anomalous
situation
arises
of
having
section
301
under
which
the
federal
court
system
was
to
create
a
body
of
federal
law
of
having
results
that
have
forced
plaintiffs
into
state
courts
where
state
courts
would
do
the
body
of
301
business
under
section
301.
and
then
the
other
side
of
it
if
you
say,
“well,
norris-laguardia
will
require
those
injunctions
to
be
dissolved.”
as
i've
said
before,
an
employer
has
less
ways
of
effectuating
his
agreement
than
he
had
before
301,
that's
not
right.
and
then
thirdly,
if
you
say,
“well,
state
courts
are
bound
by
norris-laguardia.”
and
we
know
we
can't
say
that
from
norris-laguardia.
we
would
have
to
import
through
an
interpretation
of
section
301.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
avco,
i
believe
was
1969
or
1968,
your
honor.
it's
a
rather
recent
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh,
i
think
sin
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
think
sinclair
probably
created
or
gave
rise
to
serious
problems
of
difficulties.
for
example
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
states
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes
or
in
states
where
they
have
anti-injunction
acts
that
might
have
been
interpreted
to
not
give
this
relief.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
sir
that
sinclair
had
not
given
rise
to
difficulties.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
whatever
difficulties
sinclair
gave
rise
to,
they
have
been
terrifically
increased
with
the
decision
in
avco.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
to
my
knowledge
sir
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
passed
any
resolutions
or
enacted
any
statutes
that
would
indicate
a
complaint
however
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
this
court
has
interpreted
statutes
in
various
ways.
for
example,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
lincoln
mills
as
you
most
certainly
have,
not
lincoln
mills
of
section
301,
we
find
in
there
practically
no
mention
of
arbitration.
now
what
i
think
happened
here
is
likewise
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
i
think
the
court
in
interpreting
the
statute
found
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
said,
“in
interpreting
the
statute
the
court
found
it.”
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
you
don't
find
very
much
and
also
in
looking
at
the
wording
of
301,
you
don't
find
too
much.
now,
my
point
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
well,
sir
i
don't
know
and
i
can't
agree
that
that's
correct,
that
is
if
your
assumptions
are
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
--
what
--
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
saying,
i
can't
agree
that
there
would
be
a
change
simply
because
the
composition
of
the
court
has
changed?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
i
said
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
--
the
same
justices
could
conceivably
have
come
to
the
conclusion
and
this
court
has
done
this
before.
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
something
incorrectly
some
years
ago
and
rectify
it.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unusual
about
that
either
in
the
--
our
legal
system
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
your
honor
it's
been
done
lately
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
now
another
thing
that's
been
suggested
is
that
discipline
is
a
means
of
controlling
this.
sir,
you
can't
fire
your
whole
warehouse
crew.
i
don't
have
enough
time
to
dwell
on
these
things.
its
illusion,
it's
a
snare.
disciplining
employees
doesn't
do
any
good
because
you
need
them.
you're
in
business
to
produce
goods
or
to
sell
goods
as
the
case
may
be.
next,
they
talk
about
quickie
arbitrations.
quickie
arbitrations
are
misnomer,
they're
an
illusion,
the
best
illustration
of
that,
we
covered
it
in
our
reply
brief,
the
best
illustration
of
it
though
is
to
be
found
in
the
new
orleans
steamship
case
where
they
had
a
quickie
arbitration
procedure,
quickie,
yes.
the
hearing
lasted
for
four
days
and
the
decision
didn't
come
out
until
over
two
months
later.
now,
in
summary
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
no,
your
honor,
you
don't
understand
me
or
if
you
do
understand
me
to
be
saying
that
you
misunderstand
me.
what
i'm
saying
sir
is
that
there
has
been
a
suggestion
particularly
in
the
brief
of
afl-cio
amicus
that
perhaps
a
proper
substitute
would
be
the
negotiation
of
so-called
quickie
arbitration
provisions
and
we've
been
at
some
pains
in
reply
brief
to
point
out
why
this
isn't
so
and
i
was
just
in
my
argument
passing
by
and
adverting
to
that
fact
sir.
in
any
event
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
sinclair
was
wrongly
decided
and
as
i
say,
we
think
it
should
be
reversed.
and
i
pointed
out
what
i
think
or
the
really
the
thorny
thicket
that
--
i
mean
this
business
of
really
painting
the
court
and
the
profession
and
the
law
into
a
corner
if
we
continue
down
this
path
because
of
the
fact
that
we
now
have
to
decide
if
sinclair
remains
viable,
we
have
to
decide
what
we
are
going
to
do
about
remove
state
court
injunctions.
we
get
by
that,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
the
power
of
state
courts
to
issue
injunctions
particularly,
well
for
some
reason
they
aren't
removed.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
a
proper
accommodation
of
norris-laguardia
and
section
301
sanctions
the
injunction
in
this
case,
it's
a
vital
part
of
section
301's
effectuation.
i
would
say
that
the
availability
of
the
injunction
is
far
more
necessary
to
section
301
than
it
is
detrimental
to
norris-laguardia
and
therefore
its
respectfully
submitted
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed
with
instructions
to
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
very
brief
time
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
make
two
or
three
points.
first
of
all,
with
reference
to
the
statements
and
the
contentions
that
have
been
made
on
account
of
the
failure
of
congress
to
act
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
sinclair
and
also
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
sinclair
is
some
kind
of
a
stare
decisis
impact.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
decision
of
this
court
which
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
we
didn't
cover
this
point
helvering
versus
hallock
this
case
is
to
be
found
in
309
u.s.
106.
the
decision
in
the
case
was
offered
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
stone,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
mr.
justice
murphy.
on
page
118
of
the
official
report
and
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
would
just
like
to
read
three
or
four
sentences.
this
case
involved
a
situation
where
there
had
been
three
different
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
a
tax
matter
and
the
court
was
faced
with
the
question
as
to
whether
it
should
further
proliferate
these
decisions
or
whether
it
should
just
take
the
three
decisions
that
come
on
before
and
in
fact
overturn
them.
“our
real
problem,
therefore,
is
to
determine
whether
we
are
to
adhere
to
a
harmonizing
principle
in
the
construction
of
302
(c),
or
whether
we
are
to
multiply
gossamer
distinctions
between
the
present
cases
and
the
three
earlier
cases.”
now,
skipping
your
honor,
“we
recognize
that
stare
decisis
embodies
an
important
social
policy.
it
represents
an
element
of
continuity
in
and
law
and
it’s
rooted
in
the
psychologic
need
to
satisfy
reasonable
expectations.
but
stare
decisis
is
a
principle
policy
and
not
a
mechanical
formula
of
adherence
to
the
latest
decision,
however
recent
and
questionable,
where
such
adherence
involves
collision
with
a
prior
doctrine
more
embracing
in
its
scope,
intrinsically
sounder
and
verified
by
experience.”
skipping
now
for
one
more
sentence
to
what
would
be
page
121
of
the
official
reporter.
“this
court,
unlike
the
house
of
lords,
has
from
the
beginning
rejected
the
doctrine
of
disability
and
self-correction.
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
want
to
congressional
action
to
modify
by
legislation
the
result
from
the
st.
louis
trust
cases,
it
will
hardly
be
urged
that
the
reason
was
congressional
approval
of
these
distinctions”
and
then
the
court
goes
on.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
yes,
your
honor.
helvering
versus
hallock
it’s
to
be
found
at
--
in
the
official
reporter
as
i
said
at
309
u.s.
106.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
309.
now,
also
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
the
decision
of
girouard
versus
united
states
328
u.s.
61.
the
first
case
i
cited
i
believe
was
a
1940
case.
this
is
a
1946
case.
this
involved
a
matter
arising
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
opinion
in
that
case
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
murphy,
mr.
justice
rutledge
and
mr.
justice
burger.
one
sentence
from
that
case
if
i
might
please
once
again
a
prior
--
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
321
u.s.
61
your
honor.
one
sentence,
“it
is,
at
best,
treacherous
to
find
in
congressional
silence
alone
the
adoption
of
a
controlling
rule
of
law.”
now,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
and
so
i
can't
make
some
of
the
other
points
i'd
like
to
make
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
only
remedy
that’s
going
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
section
301
is
going
to
be
the
availability
of
the
injunction
against
the
strike
in
breach
of
contract.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
joseph
m.
mclaughlin
oh!
one
thing
your
honors
if
i
might,
i
apologize.
i
will
direct
your
attention
with
respect
to
this
idea
about
equality
to
section
2
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief.
we
have
covered
this
so
called
imbalance
situation
and
i
would
ask
you
to
read
it
with
some
care.
thank
you.
