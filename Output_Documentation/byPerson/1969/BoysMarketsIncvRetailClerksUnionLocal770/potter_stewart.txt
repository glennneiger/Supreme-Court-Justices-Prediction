stewart
oh!
i
don't
understand.
i
understand
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
damage
suits
under
section
301
which
i
understood
you
to
concede
are
permissible
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
court
has
held
so
wouldn't
the
--
any
court
be
face
with
exactly
the
same
sort
of
problems
that
you're
telling
us
are
so
impossible
and
so
inappropriate
for
court
decision?
in
a
damage
suit,
you'd
have
exactly
the
same
kind
of
issues.
it
will
be
decided
by
court
and
or
a
jury
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
this
case
involves
not
sinclair
directly
does
it
but
rather
the
situation
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
the
avco
case?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
case
--
no,
i'll
make
premise
on
this.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
that
this
was
originally
brought
in
the
state
court
and
then
moved
to
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
in
the
federal
court,
the
order
previously
granted
by
the
state
court
was
set
aside
if
i'm
not
mistaken
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
did
on
the
basis
of
sinclair
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
had
to
decide
of
the
avco
case
on
the
basis
of
sinclair.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
court,
in
this
court
we
left
the
question
open
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
respect
to
a
removed
case,
did
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
the
last
footnote
of
the
court's
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
not
as
so
this
had
all
been
decided
in
sinclair?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
you
submitted
to
attach
then
but
it's
not
all
that
are
in
bound
the
stare
decisis.
we
have
in
fact
left
the
question
open
with
respect
to
removed
cases
in
the
avco
opinion,
didn’t
we?
justice
potter
stewart
or
really
all
avco
held
was
that
issue
remove,
that
was
a
removable
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
period.
that
was
the
holding
in
avco.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
it
couldn't
be
remanded
back
to
the
state
court
that's
what
avco
holds?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
beyond
that
in
avco,
in
the
avco
it
so
happened
that
the
federal
district
court
set
aside
the
order
for
use
to
be
granted
by
the
state
court.
it
wasn't
clear
on
the
record
why
the
court
had
done
so.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
as
i
remember
in
the
avco
case
had
held
yes
it
was
--
now
the
property
didn't
so
but
it
was
required
to
do
so
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
that's
the
question
that
we
left
opened
and
decided
the
court
left
open
in
deciding
the
avco
case
here,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
don't
understand.
i
