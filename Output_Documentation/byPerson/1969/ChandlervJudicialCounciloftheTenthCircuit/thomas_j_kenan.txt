mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
thank
you
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
gentlemen,
this
is
a
case
that's
here
on
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
and/or
mandamus
in
the
matter
of
the
honorable
stephen
chandler,
judge
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
against
the
tenth
judicial
council
of
the
united
states.
i
will
briefly
state
the
facts
in
this
matter.
on
december
13,
1965,
the
judicial
council
of
the
tenth
circuit
entered
a
--
entered
an
order,
held
after
a
secret
meeting
at
which
judge
chandler
was
not
able
to
be
present,
and
the
order
effectively
stripped
judge
chandler
of
all
of
his
powers.
he
was
ordered
not
to
hear
any
of
the
cases
assigned
to
him,
nor
was
he
to
be
allowed
to
hear
any
further
cases
that
would
be
filed
in
his
court.
the
other
judges
of
his
court
were
ordered
to
divide
judge
chan
--
judge
chandler's
cases
among
themselves
and
to
enter
into
a
new
order
of
business
whereby
none
of
the
future
cases
filed
in
the
court
could
be
assigned
to
judge
chandler.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
think
there's
three,
maybe
four
--
four
judges.
there's
also
an
inactive
judge,
or
there
was
at
the
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
this
order
was
signed
by
the
members
of
the
judicial
council,
not
as
members
of
judicial
council
but
as
circuit
judges.
it
was
filed
in
the
tenth
circuit
court.
it
was
filed
in
the
western
district
court
and
a
deputy
marshal
was
ordered
to
serve
it
on
judge
chandler.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
sir,
the
order
itself,
the
signators
or
the
judges
who
signed
it
beneath
their
signators,
they
said
circuit
judge.
this
point,
your
honor,
i
bring
up
because
it
does
have
some
bearing
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
it
does
enter
into
that
argument.
it
does
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
these
judges
were
entertaining
judicial
powers
or
administrative
powers.
they
were
clothing
about
themselves
the
powers
of
the
judicial
offices,
which
they
held
when
they
signed
the
order,
circuit
judge,
filed
at
the
court
and
they
got
a
deputy
marshal
to
serve
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
don't
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
section
332
of
title
28
provides
that
a
meeting
of
the
judicial
council
shall
be
called
by
the
chief
judge
at
least
twice
a
year.
i'm
not
convinced
that
the
chief
judge
can't
call
a
meeting
of
the
circuit
judges
for
other
reasons.
if
another
a
judge
calls
a
meeting,
is
it
a
proper
meeting
of
the
judicial
council?
according
to
the
statute,
only
the
chief
judge
can
call
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well
sir,
the
statute
provides
only
that
they're
required
to
meet
at
least
twice
a
year.
they
can
certainly
meet
more
often.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
i
believe
that
this
was
a
meeting
of
the
judicial
council.
i'm
not
questioning
that.
it
was
the
judicial
council
which
uttered
the
order.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
brought
this
up
only
for
the
jurisdictional
problems,
which
i
will
come
to
a
bit
later.
this
meeting
effectively
stripped
judge
chandler
of
all
of
his
judicial
powers.
there
was
not
a
slight
semblance
of
due
process
at
the
meeting,
he
wasn't
allowed
to
be
present.
he
didn't
know
what
the
charges
were.
he
wasn't
allowed
to
cross-examine
anyone,
couldn't
have
counsel.
the
order
that
was
entered
spoke
in
rather
strange
terms
about
why
his
cases
were
being
taken
away
from
him.
it
mentioned
the
effect
on
the
business
of
judge
chandler's
court
of
his
attitude
and
conduct.
it
mentioned
that
he
was
a
party
defendant
in
both
civil
and
criminal
litigation
and
stated
that
one
civil
case
was
still
pending
and
are
--
there
were
also
two
disqualification
proceedings
against
him.
it
stated
that
after
a
review
of
the
entire
situation
that
judge
chandler
was
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
discharge
efficiently
the
powers
of
his
office,
and
that
was
why
all
of
his
cases
were
taken
from
him.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
it
is
exhibit
a
to
the
original
motion
for
leave
to
file
that
was
entered
in
this
case,
the
first
--
the
first
matter
filed.
after
the
--
after
the
handing
down
of
the
order,
we
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
this
court.
we
also
made
application
for
stay
of
the
judicial
council's
order.
a
few
days
later,
there
appeared,
solicitor
general
marshall
representing,
the
judicial
council
and
he
advised
this
court
that
the
order
of
the
judicial
council
was
intended
to
be
temporary
only,
pending
prompt
further
proceedings
by
the
judicial
council.
he
stated
that
a
hearing
would
be
held,
at
which
hearing,
the
judicial
council
would
determine
what
powers
to
use.
under
three
sections
--
this
is
very
interesting,
your
honors,
it
was
cited
not
only
section
332,
which
provides
administrative
powers
we
believe
for
judicial
councils,
but
section
137
which
provides
a
method
whereby
judicial
councils
can
settle
disputes
among
district
judges
when
they
can't
decide
on
how
to
assign
new
cases
in
their
court.
but
solicitor
general
marshall
mentioned
that
the
judicial
council
wanted
to
consider
what
use
of
its
power
should
be
made
under
section
372
(b),
which
as
the
members
of
this
court
know
a
section
that
bears
upon
the
mental
fitness
of
a
federal
judge.
in
other
words,
he
was
suggesting
to
this
court
that
reason
existed
perhaps
for
the
judicial
council
to
certify
to
the
president
that
judge
chandler
was
permanently,
mentally
disabled.
solicitor
general
marshall
stated
that
the
order
had
been
issued
only
to
keep
judge
chandler
from
filling
his
office
while
the
conduct
of
his
office
was
thus
in
question
and
he
stated
that
the
order
was
interlocutory.
that
pending
a
full
hearing
into
the
fitness
of
judge
chandler,
and
then
the
solicitor
general
said
that
he
had
personally
examined
files
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
here
in
washington
that
it
was
his
conviction,
conviction
of
the
matter,
warranted
careful
examination,
that
it
was
highly
desirable
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
that
public
confidence
in
the
federal
judiciary
would
be
inevitably
impaired
if
judge
chandler
were
to
preside
over
his
court
while
the
question
of
his
fitness
to
serve
was
under
consideration.
well,
we
can
quite
understand
why
this
court
denied
the
application
for
stay,
based
upon
this
very
strong
language
of
the
solicitor
general.
we
can
understand
it,
we
--
it
happened,
anyway,
the
application
for
stay
was
denied.
after
that
was
denied,
the
judicial
council
then
did
issue
a
second
order.
in
our
opinion,
this
order
did
not
call
for
the
type
of
hearing
that
had
been
represented
to
you,
gentlemen,
by
the
judicial
council
would
be
held.
judge
chandler
wasn't
ordered
to
come
to
any
hearing.
he
was
notified
that
a
hearing
would
be
held
and
that
if
he
wanted
to
appear,
he
might,
and
that
he
could
present
to
the
hearing
such
matters
as
he
deemed
desirable.
there
was
no
indication
of
any
charges
against
him.
he
wasn't
ordered.
the
county
was
told
he
could
bring
counsel
if
he
wanted.
well,
judge
chandler
advised
both
this
court
and
the
judicial
council
that
he
would
not
attend
such
a
hearing,
that
he
challenged
their
jurisdiction
to
remove
cases
from
him
and
upon
that,
the
judicial
council
then
decided
that
it
would
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
the
second
order
merely
called
for
the
hearing.
at
the
time
that
judge
chandler
stated
that
he
wouldn't
appear
at
the
hearing,
then
the
other
district
judges
in
judge
chandler's
court
then
advised
judge
chandler
that
the
original
order
had
ordered
them
to
re-divide
all
the
cases
in
the
court.
this
court
had
denied
his
application
for
stay.
it
appeared
that
we
were
in
for
a
long
session
with
respect
to
this
matter.
at
that
point,
the
district
judges
advised
judge
chandler
that
they
ought
to
do
something
with
respect
to
complying
to
the
first
order
of
the
judicial
council.
so
the
judges
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
it
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
the
judicial
council
is
given
the
authority
to
examine
the
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
courts
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
judicial
council
is
the
tenth
circuit
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
they've
done
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
circuit.
i
honestly
don't,
and
i
just
know
this
one
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that's
correct,
sir.
well,
after
the
district
judges
then
met
to
decide
upon
a
new
order
of
business
since
it
appeared
that
judge
chandler
was
going
to
require
some
time
to
settle
this
matter,
judge
chandler
disagreed
with
the
re-division
of
his
standing
cases,
those
already
assigned
to
him
among
the
other
judges.
and
he
did
agree
however
that
in
order
to
keep
this
matter
going
and
not
to
get
into
a
complete
brawl
with
the
members
of
the
district
court
who
were
only
trying
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
judicial
council
and
were
going
to
let
judge
chandler
contest
them,
he
agreed
that
he
wouldn't
hear
any
cases
assigned,
any
future
cases
filed
in
his
court,
although
he
did
not
believe
the
judicial
council
had
power
to
take
those
away
from
him,
but
he
disagreed
with
respect
to
reassigning
cases
already
assigned
to
him.
at
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
the
--
there
is
a
system
whereby
the
cases
are
arbitrarily
assigned
to
judges,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
as
they're
filed,
yes
sir,
by
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
after
this
new
division
of
order
was
entered
into,
the
judicial
council
then
did
this
next
strange
thing.
it
said
well,
we
now
have
power
under
section
137
to
allocate
cases
in
this
court
because
there's
a
disagreement
with
respect
to
the
division
of
cases
already
on
file
in
judge
chandler's
court,
judge
chandler
is
disagreeing
that
these
cases
can
be
reassigned.
therefore
--
and
this
was
their
decision
--
we're
going
to
let
the
present
situation
stand
as
to
existing
cases,
but
we're
going
to
re-divide
the
newly
filed
cases.
well,
it
didn't
make
any
sense
but
nevertheless,
that's
what
happened
and
they
superseded,
they
said,
the
old
order.
well,
gentlemen,
at
this
point
when
the
first
order
was
superseded,
what
we're
questioning
here
today
is
the
first
order.
there
are
other
facts
in
this
case
that
go
on,
which
facts
have
a
bearing
upon
whether
or
not
this
court
should
exercise
its
discretion,
which
the
granting
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
always
is,
because
these
further
facts
bear
upon
the
attitude
of
the
judicial
council
and
the
true
spirit
in
which
this
punitive
order
was
entered
into.
these
facts
can
be
boiled
down
basically
to
one
thing.
for
a
couple
of
years
thereafter,
the
judicial
council
went
through
an
elaborate
procedure,
designed
to
create
a
paper
record
that
they
were
acting
all
along
to
assist
judge
chandler
in
cleaning
up
a
crowded
docket.
they
got
documents
from
the
administrator
of
the
court
bearing
upon
his
case
load.
the
facts
were
from
the
very
beginning
judge
chandler's
case
load,
was
a
number
of
cases
less
than
he
normally
decides
in
a
year.
the
facts
are
that
when
the
first
order
was
issued,
there
was
no
mention
made
of
a
crowded
case
load.
this
was
an
afterthought
and
it
was
designed
by
the
judicial
council
to
try
to
detain
some
kind
of
firm
ground
upon
which
to
base
their
assault
on
judge
chandler.
your
honor,
we
came
here
and
we
based
the
jurisdiction
of
this
case
upon
the
all
writs
act.
there
is
a
very
excellent
inquiry
into
the
jurisdictional
problems
of
this
case
that
the
solicitor
general
has
in
his
brief,
and
also
the
counsel
for
the
respondent.
these
jurisdictional
problems
boil
down
basically
to
a
single
question.
for
instance,
both
solicitor
general
and
mr.
wright
do
not
disagree
that
the
all
writs
act
does
provide
authority
for
this
court
to
act.
they
disagree
only
on
the
constitutional
ground,
whether
or
not
this
case
is
within
the
appellate
powers
of
this
court
and
all
that
question
boils
down
to
one
point,
was
the
judicial
council
acting
as
a
lower
court
or
an
inferior
tribunal
rather
than
an
administrative
agency
in
this
proceeding?
solicitor
general
griswold
contends
that
it
was.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that
it
was
acting
as
a
court,
as
an
inferior
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
when
it
issued
this
order,
stripping
judge
chandler
of
his
powers.
he
contends
that
no
matter
what
their
nature,
that
they
were
acting
as
a
court
would
act.
now,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
congress
intended
that
the
judicial
council
be
an
administrative
agency.
i
agree
entirely
and
yet,
this
council
is
composed
of
judges
who
have
judicial
power
and
they
acted
in
a
way
that
judges
would
act,
and
i
contend
that
they
were
acting
with
the
judicial
powers
of
their
offices.
and
i
also
will
say
this
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
contend
that
the
judicial
conference
could
act
in
a
way
in
which
was
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
powers.
for
instance,
a
judicial
council
is
given
the
power
to
remove
a
referee
in
bankruptcy.
now,
this
is
the
exercise
of
judicial
powers.
it's
admitted
by
mr.
wright
that
it's
the
exercise
of
judicial
powers.
this
is
given
to
the
judicial
council
statutorily,
this
right.
so
congress
did
give
for
instance
to
a
judicial
council
at
least
one
specific
and
explicit
instance
of
the
right
to
exercise
judicial
powers.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
i
was
back
on
the
judicial
council,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
the
council
--
the
council
by
statue
of
congress
is
given
the
authority
when
the
district
judges
cannot
agree
upon
the
removal
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy,
to
remove
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
of
their
court
upon
a
hearing,
and
this
is
provided
by
congress.
so
it
shows
that
in
this
one
statute
that
the
congress
does
believe
that
a
judicial
council
can't
act
with
the
judicial
powers
that
the
judges
have.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
sir?
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
that
is
cited
in
mr.
wright's
brief,
the
section
--
the
statute
--
i
don't
recall
a
particular
statute
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
at
this
instant,
but
it
is
cited
in
there.
it's
a
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
your
honor,
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
removal
of
a
bankruptcy
--
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy?
well,
your
honor,
this
referee
in
bankruptcy
is
acting
over
cases
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
but
those
are
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir.
he's
performing
an
executive
function
when
he
does
that
because
these
lesser
officers
are
exercising
part
of
the
executive
powers
given
to
the
president.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
if
the
judicial
officer
is
able
to
employ
discretion
in
the
performance
of
his
duties,
which
discretion
you
would
ordinarily
think
are
those
of
a
judge,
then
i
would
say
that
judicial
power
is
concerned.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
there,
i
think
that's
an
administrative
assistance
to
the
judge.
he
has
full
power
to
remove
his
law
clerk
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
by
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
court
is
appointing
an
officer
to
perform
certain
judicial
functions.
i
think
the
referee
performs
judicial
functions.
i
think
it's
a
very
high
honor
for
--
for
a
lawyer
to
be
appointed
to
this.
it
certainly
is
in
assistance
of
the
judges
of
the
court
in
their
carrying
out
their
judicial
functions
and
i
think
that
when
a
judicial
council
acts
to
remove
from
a
judge
all
of
his
power
to
hear
and
decide
cases
that
now,
we
have
the
strongest
possible
instance
when
someone
is
exercising
judicial
power.
your
honor,
the
main
thing
is
the
--
is
this
section
332
which
set
up
judicial
councils
and
what
it
means.
and
i
want
to
direct
this
court's
attention
to
i
think
the
most
significant
part
of
this
case,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
meaning
of
section
332
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
1948
when
there
was
a
revision
of
the
judicial
code
that
there
were
important
changes
made
that
slipped
by
the
congress
in
such
a
manner
that
congressional
intent
could
not
have
been
involved
and
that
these
changes
cannot
be
the
law.
the
committee
report
in
1948
stated,
and
it
was
only
eight
pages
long
with
a
big
appendix
to
--
of
the
reviser's
notes.
the
committee
report
said,
“the
reviser's
notes
are
akin
to
the
sections
of
the
revision
and
explain
in
detail
every
change
made
in
the
past.”
now,
that's
the
notice
given
to
the
congress.
the
reviser's
notes
on
section
332
said,
“changes
in
phraseology
were
made,”
there
were
two
other
remarks,
but
they
don't
bear
upon
this
case.
well,
your
honor,
if
you
will
compare
the
1939
statute,
which
was
the
original
one,
and
the
1948
statute,
and
i
have
these
two
statutes
laid
out
side
by
side
on
page
13
of
my
brief.
i
think
that
you
can
see
what
violence
was
done
to
the
1939
statute.
now,
the
1939
statute
has
cohesion
and
builds
logically
from
first,
the
calling
of
council
meetings
to
second,
the
submission
to
the
meetings
of
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
court
reports,
next,
to
the
taking
of
action
thereon
by
the
council,
and
finally,
notice
to
the
district
judges
of
their
duty
to
promptly
carry
out
the
directions
of
the
council
as
to
the
administration
of
business
of
their
courts.
your
honors,
in
the
1948
revised
version,
there's
been
a
lot
said
about
the
fact
that
the
word
“order”
was
substituted
for
the
word
“directions,”
that
that's
not
the
principal
change
that
was
made.
the
principal
change
made
is
that
in
the
1948
act,
the
judicial
council
was
given
two
sources
of
authority.
in
the
1939
act,
it
was
given
a
single
source
of
authority.
the
1948
act
in
the
third
paragraph,
continues
as
the
1939
act
did,
talks
about
the
quarterly
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
courts
and
then
says,
“the
council
shall
take
such
action
thereon
as
may
be
necessary.”
there
is
a
source
of
power
for
judicial
councils.
then
it
breaks
a
paragraph
and
it
commences
with
the
final
paragraph,
and
it
commences
with
a
second
source
of
power,
which
the
1939
act
didn't
have.
it
says,
“each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
administration
of
the
business
of
the
courts
within
its
circuit.”
it's
got
two
statements
of
authority;
the
1939
act
had
one
and
now,
the
sentence
about
the
judges
carrying
into
effect
that
directions
or
orders,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it,
this
section
is
put
at
the
bottom
after
the
second
source
of
power
of
judicial
councils.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
said
about
the
powers
of
judicial
councils
being
just
about
plenary,
and
i
can
see
why
because
when
this
1948
revision
was
made,
there
was
slipped
into
this
statute
in
the
revis
--
in
the
revising
process,
two
sources
of
power
for
judicial
councils,
and
that
was
not
the
intent
in
the
1939
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
sir,
it
was
a
very
complicated
and
extended
procedure.
the
actual
revising
of
the
code;
the
bar
was
involved,
the
judges
were
involved,
the
justices
were
involved,
law
professors
were
involved.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
my
memory
may
be
faulty
,but
with
all
due
respect,
i
do
not
believe
you
are
correct.
the
change
that
was
made
was
made
in
the
house
in
the
1948
revision,
this
was
a
house
bill.
the
particular
statement
you're
referring
to
about
the
act
has
not
teeth
in
it
occurred
in
hearings
before
the
senate
in
the
1939
enactment.
in
1948,
the
act
originated
in
the
house,
was
placed
on
the
consent
calendar
of
the
house
whereby
it
goes
through
automatically
because
the
committee
report
says
there
really
aren't
any
substantive
changes
made
in
the
old
law,
and
congressmen
are
given
this
very
slight
notice
of
this
act
is
intended
to
change
law
and
the
appendix
even
said
in
the
house
report
that
the
law
wasn't
changed
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
that
was
the
intention
of
their
questioning.
they
did
ask
the
question
and
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
chief
justice
groner
or
someone
who
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
said
in
their
opinion,
there
were
sufficient
teeth
because
if
the
judicial
council
made
a
direction
that
it
would
be
carried
out
quite
naturally
and
that
no
further
words
were
needed.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
desolation
of
the
1939
discussion
about
were
teeth
needed.
i
think
that
people
may
have
been
concerned
at
the
time
whether
or
not
they
could
put
additional
teeth
in
there
if
it
came
to
a
point
of
taking
a
judge's
cases
away
from
him.
well,
sir,
your
honor,
the
--
i
think
the
history
of
the
1939
act
really
is
a
history
which
shows
that
what
was
really
intended
to
be
done
in
1939
was
to
set
up
an
administrative
procedure
for
the
courts
to
take
away
from
the
attorney
general
the
necessity
of
attending
to
these
details.
they
provided
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
court,
a
new
office
and
they
tied
to
the
judicial
council
the
preparation
of
these
--
this
data
gathering
and
statistics
compiling
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
courts
and
submitting
these
to
the
councils
and
the
councils
acting
thereon,
and
then
issuing
directions
to
the
judges
who
shall
carry
out
the
directions,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
as
to
the
administration
of
the
business
of
their
respective
courts.
i
contend
that
the
1948
revision,
because
of
the
committee
report,
which
is
the
true
legislative
history
of
any
enactment,
because
of
the
reviser's
notes,
the
changes
in
phraseology
were
made;
that's
all.
i
contend
the
original
intention
of
1939
controlled
and
that
the
two
sources
of
authority
for
judicial
councils
to
act
now
don't
really
change
what
the
law
is
because
that
wasn't
the
intention
of
congress,
congress
didn't
intend
to
change
the
law.
your
honor,
i
notice
that
the
judicial
conference
in
1961
issued
a
report
entitled
“the
powers
and
responsibilities
of
the
judicial
councils.”
this
was
a
very
elaborate
document.
someone
got
chairman
celler
to
print
it
as
a
house
document,
and
it's
a
fine
and
elaborate
defense
of
the
judicial
councils.
in
fact,
it
even
appears
to
me
as
its
an
attempt
to
take
care
of
any
weaknesses
in
the
authority
of
judicial
councils.
this
report
immediately
focuses
on
the
ninth
--
the
first
thing
it
does
is
talk
about
the
1948
revision
and
particularly,
the
change
of
word
of
“directions”
to
“orders.”
now,
that's
strengthening
word
but
that
isn't
a
significant
thing.
nevertheless,
the
judicial
conference
says,
“the
changes
are
one
of
form
and
emphasis
rather
than
substance.”
no
change
in
substance
has
occurred.
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
judicial
conference
in
1961.
it's
important
that
that
document
makes
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
1948
statute
carries
two
sources
of
powers
for
the
judicial
council
whereby
the
1939
act
only
carried
one.
i
submit
the
--
there's
been
no
change
in
the
--
any
intention
of
congress.
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there's
another
issue
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
taking
all
the
cases
from
a
judge,
all
the
cases,
is
tantamount
to
impeachment
and
i
think
there's
a
very
serious
question
here.
the
constitution
gave
the
impeachment
powers
to
the
house
and
to
the
senate.
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
impeach
this
--
i
mean
the
house
--
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachments.
i
think
the
history
of
the
constitution
shows
that
there
was
no
intention
to
provide
any
other
means
for
removing
a
federal
judge
from
the
bench.
federal
judges
were
given
their
offices
during
good
behavior
and
yet
the
federalist
in
its
number
78
and
79,
devotes
itself
to
proving
how
important
judicial
independence
is
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people,
and
how
the
constitution
secures
that.
it
talks
about
then
about
the
impeachment
powers
of
the
house
and
senate
and
says,
“this
is
the
only
provision
on
the
point
which
is
consistent
with
the
necessary
independence
of
the
judicial
carrier.”
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
they
did
initially,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
they
did
supersede
it,
but
then
they
kept
him
from
hearing
any
cases
later
filed
in
his
court
and
furthermore,
they
pressured
him
into
all
of
this,
your
honor,
that
they've
been
acting
against
him
ever
since
the
first
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir
--
you
are
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
the
order
has
been
superseded
because
of
the
continuation
of
the
council
to
act
and
because
of
the
importance
to
the
judiciary
of
whether
they
can
do
this.
since
the
judicial
council
merely
only
has
to
supersede
any
order
when
challenged,
we
think
that
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
this
court
to
issue
mandamus
to
the
judicial
council,
to
order
them
not
to
do
this
anymore
and
to
cease
any
vestiges
of
its
action
against
judge
chandler
otherwise,
this
question
can
never
be
litigated,
so
it
meant
some
importance
to
the
judiciary.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
his
exact
situation,
your
honor,
is
that
he
has
the
remnants
of
four
or
five
cases
that
had
been
assigned
to
him
before
this
matter
arose,
that
he
has
the
remnants
of
those
still
in
his
office.
he
has
heard
the
rest
of
the
cases
that
had
been
assigned
to
him.
he
and
the
other
judges
of
his
court
have
agreed
that
no
further
cases
will
be
assigned
to
him
under
the
circumstances
of
this
matter
being
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
he
disagreed.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that
order
was
in
effect
until
several
months
ago
when
the
judicial
council
advised
the
members
--
the
other
judges
of
judge
chandler's
court
and
him
that
if
they
wish
to
enter
into
a
new
order
for
the
division
of
business,
they
might
do
so.
the
judges
considered
it
and
stated
that
under
the
circumstances,
they
will
allow
the
existing
order
to
continue.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
for
him
to
--
yes
sir,
i
would
it
was
beyond
their
power.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
judicial
council
can
--
cannot
--
can
make
such
an
order
as
to
take
away
all
the
cases
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
purported
to,
yes
sir,
and
we
challenge
that
decision
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
oh!
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
judge
--
the
--
any
disagreement
in
judge
chandler's
court
was
forced
upon
the
judges
by
the
judicial
council.
they
questioned
his
fit
--
they
came
before
this
court
and
said,
“well,
we
might
have
to
act
under
372
(b).
he
may
be
mentally
disabled”
and
yet,
they
turned
right
around
thereafter
and
say,
“well,
it's
alright
for
him
to
hear
all
the
cases
assigned
to
him.”
this
whole
thing,
there
is
one
cohesive
thing.
this
has
been
a
struggle
between
the
judicial
council
and
judge
chandler,
and
has
continued
down
to
this
moment.
and
when
the
judicial
council
offered
to
the
members
of
judge
chandler's
court
the
ability
finally
to
enter
into
a
new
order
dividing
the
business
of
their
court
without
interference
of
the
judicial
council,
the
judges
of
this
court
said,
“under
the
circumstances,
the
present
order
will
stand.”
the
present
order
still
stands,
but
is
agreeable
to
the
members
of
his
court
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
is
not
my
contention
that
section
137
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
it's
quite
constitutional,
your
honor.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
the
congressional
intent
behind
137
was
that
the
judicial
council
can
divide
the
cases
of
a
district
court
in
the
event
of
a
genuine
disagreement
of
the
judges
of
that
court
as
to
the
manner
of
dividing
the
cases.
this
is
not
a
genuine
disagreement,
this
is
one
that
the
judicial
council
created.
it
created
the
disagreement.
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
would
agree,
your
honor
that's
perfectly
fine.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
said
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
the
section
137
certainly
superficially
authorizes
the
second
order
of
the
judicial
council
because
the
judges
were
disagreeing.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
that's
alright.
that's
the
type
of
disagreement
that
the
--
that
section
137
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
you
mean
with
respect
to
the
judicial
council
removing
the
ability
of
a
judge
to
hear
any
cases
thereafter?
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
then
they
removed
from
his
office.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
effectively
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
he
just
has
the
remnants
of
a
few
cases
around.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
that
is
just
exactly
what
i
am
saying
the
judicial
council
cannot
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
first
of
all,
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir,
they
cannot
do
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
because
it
--
is
tantamount
to
impeachment.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
suggest
that
is
a
judicial
power,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
what
is
--
what
is
involved
there
is
--
is
a
legitimate
determination
that
a
judge
is
overworked
under
the
circumstances.
he
has
a
crowded
docket
and
he
should
refrain
temporarily
in
taking
on
new
cases,
but
there,
we
have
the
facts
supporting
that,
your
honor.
in
a
case
at
bar,
i
contend
we
don't
have
the
facts
supporting
it
and
without
the
factual
basis
for
it,
then
that
makes
the
difference
between
constitutionality
and
unconstitutionality.
your
hypothetical
is
quite
constitutional
until
the
judge
catches
up.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
just
believe
that
--
that
taking
cases
away
from
a
judge
is
a
judicial
action.
it
certainly
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
to
tell
you
the
truth
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
we
may
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
it
--
it
may
be
we
should
draw
a
fine
line
here,
that
with
respect
to
future
cases,
it's
an
administrative
decision
because
the
judge's
powers
have
not
yet
been
invoked.
but
with
respect
to
cases
already
assigned
to
the
judge
that
are
moving
through
the
judicial
process
upon
which
hearings
have
been
held,
matters
are
ready
for
final
determination,
then
they
pluck
a
case
away
from
a
judge
involves
the
judicial
process.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
judge
chandler
is
contesting
the
right
of
the
judicial
council
to
deny
him
the
right
to
participate
in
the
judicial
process.
he
had
over
a
hundred
cases
already
assigned
to
him,
some
were
moving
towards
final
judgment.
he
was
ordered
to
retire
from
those
cases.
the
appellate
powers
of
the
court
were
involved,
and
judge
chandler
has
contested
the
right
of
this
body
to
take
him
out
of
those
cases.
there
is
your
controversy.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
will
concede
that,
but
i
want
to
make
a
careful
point
here.
in
my
opinion,
the
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
judicial
councils
in
this
type
of
matter
only
administrative
powers.
i
believe
that
the
judicial
council,
which
also
has
some
judicial
powers,
exceeded
its
powers
and
assumed
judicial
powers.
it
is
a
court
and
i
believe
that
it
should
be
confined
to
the
proper
exercise
of
its
powers
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
but
it
was
exercised
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
--
the
members
of
the
council
are
members
of
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
didn't.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that,
your
honor.
i
said
that
members
of
the
council
are
members
of
a
court
and
when
they
act
with
the
full
cloak
of
their
office
around
them,
sign
their
orders,
circuit
judge,
file
them
in
the
court
records,
get
marshals
to
serve
them,
remove
a
judge
from
cases,
they're
acting
as
judges.
they're
involved
in
the
judicial
process.
they
should
be
confined
to
the
rightful
exercise
of
their
--
of
their
duties.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
thank
you
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
gentlemen,
this
is
a
case
that's
here
on
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
and/or
mandamus
in
the
matter
of
the
honorable
stephen
chandler,
judge
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
against
the
tenth
judicial
council
of
the
united
states.
i
will
briefly
state
the
facts
in
this
matter.
on
december
13,
1965,
the
judicial
council
of
the
tenth
circuit
entered
a
--
entered
an
order,
held
after
a
secret
meeting
at
which
judge
chandler
was
not
able
to
be
present,
and
the
order
effectively
stripped
judge
chandler
of
all
of
his
powers.
he
was
ordered
not
to
hear
any
of
the
cases
assigned
to
him,
nor
was
he
to
be
allowed
to
hear
any
further
cases
that
would
be
filed
in
his
court.
the
other
judges
of
his
court
were
ordered
to
divide
judge
chan
--
judge
chandler's
cases
among
themselves
and
to
enter
into
a
new
order
of
business
whereby
none
of
the
future
cases
filed
in
the
court
could
be
assigned
to
judge
chandler.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
think
there's
three,
maybe
four
--
four
judges.
there's
also
an
inactive
judge,
or
there
was
at
the
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
this
order
was
signed
by
the
members
of
the
judicial
council,
not
as
members
of
judicial
council
but
as
circuit
judges.
it
was
filed
in
the
tenth
circuit
court.
it
was
filed
in
the
western
district
court
and
a
deputy
marshal
was
ordered
to
serve
it
on
judge
chandler.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
sir,
the
order
itself,
the
signators
or
the
judges
who
signed
it
beneath
their
signators,
they
said
circuit
judge.
this
point,
your
honor,
i
bring
up
because
it
does
have
some
bearing
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
it
does
enter
into
that
argument.
it
does
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
these
judges
were
entertaining
judicial
powers
or
administrative
powers.
they
were
clothing
about
themselves
the
powers
of
the
judicial
offices,
which
they
held
when
they
signed
the
order,
circuit
judge,
filed
at
the
court
and
they
got
a
deputy
marshal
to
serve
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
don't
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
section
332
of
title
28
provides
that
a
meeting
of
the
judicial
council
shall
be
called
by
the
chief
judge
at
least
twice
a
year.
i'm
not
convinced
that
the
chief
judge
can't
call
a
meeting
of
the
circuit
judges
for
other
reasons.
if
another
a
judge
calls
a
meeting,
is
it
a
proper
meeting
of
the
judicial
council?
according
to
the
statute,
only
the
chief
judge
can
call
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well
sir,
the
statute
provides
only
that
they're
required
to
meet
at
least
twice
a
year.
they
can
certainly
meet
more
often.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
i
believe
that
this
was
a
meeting
of
the
judicial
council.
i'm
not
questioning
that.
it
was
the
judicial
council
which
uttered
the
order.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
brought
this
up
only
for
the
jurisdictional
problems,
which
i
will
come
to
a
bit
later.
this
meeting
effectively
stripped
judge
chandler
of
all
of
his
judicial
powers.
there
was
not
a
slight
semblance
of
due
process
at
the
meeting,
he
wasn't
allowed
to
be
present.
he
didn't
know
what
the
charges
were.
he
wasn't
allowed
to
cross-examine
anyone,
couldn't
have
counsel.
the
order
that
was
entered
spoke
in
rather
strange
terms
about
why
his
cases
were
being
taken
away
from
him.
it
mentioned
the
effect
on
the
business
of
judge
chandler's
court
of
his
attitude
and
conduct.
it
mentioned
that
he
was
a
party
defendant
in
both
civil
and
criminal
litigation
and
stated
that
one
civil
case
was
still
pending
and
are
--
there
were
also
two
disqualification
proceedings
against
him.
it
stated
that
after
a
review
of
the
entire
situation
that
judge
chandler
was
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
discharge
efficiently
the
powers
of
his
office,
and
that
was
why
all
of
his
cases
were
taken
from
him.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
it
is
exhibit
a
to
the
original
motion
for
leave
to
file
that
was
entered
in
this
case,
the
first
--
the
first
matter
filed.
after
the
--
after
the
handing
down
of
the
order,
we
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
this
court.
we
also
made
application
for
stay
of
the
judicial
council's
order.
a
few
days
later,
there
appeared,
solicitor
general
marshall
representing,
the
judicial
council
and
he
advised
this
court
that
the
order
of
the
judicial
council
was
intended
to
be
temporary
only,
pending
prompt
further
proceedings
by
the
judicial
council.
he
stated
that
a
hearing
would
be
held,
at
which
hearing,
the
judicial
council
would
determine
what
powers
to
use.
under
three
sections
--
this
is
very
interesting,
your
honors,
it
was
cited
not
only
section
332,
which
provides
administrative
powers
we
believe
for
judicial
councils,
but
section
137
which
provides
a
method
whereby
judicial
councils
can
settle
disputes
among
district
judges
when
they
can't
decide
on
how
to
assign
new
cases
in
their
court.
but
solicitor
general
marshall
mentioned
that
the
judicial
council
wanted
to
consider
what
use
of
its
power
should
be
made
under
section
372
(b),
which
as
the
members
of
this
court
know
a
section
that
bears
upon
the
mental
fitness
of
a
federal
judge.
in
other
words,
he
was
suggesting
to
this
court
that
reason
existed
perhaps
for
the
judicial
council
to
certify
to
the
president
that
judge
chandler
was
permanently,
mentally
disabled.
solicitor
general
marshall
stated
that
the
order
had
been
issued
only
to
keep
judge
chandler
from
filling
his
office
while
the
conduct
of
his
office
was
thus
in
question
and
he
stated
that
the
order
was
interlocutory.
that
pending
a
full
hearing
into
the
fitness
of
judge
chandler,
and
then
the
solicitor
general
said
that
he
had
personally
examined
files
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
here
in
washington
that
it
was
his
conviction,
conviction
of
the
matter,
warranted
careful
examination,
that
it
was
highly
desirable
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
that
public
confidence
in
the
federal
judiciary
would
be
inevitably
impaired
if
judge
chandler
were
to
preside
over
his
court
while
the
question
of
his
fitness
to
serve
was
under
consideration.
well,
we
can
quite
understand
why
this
court
denied
the
application
for
stay,
based
upon
this
very
strong
language
of
the
solicitor
general.
we
can
understand
it,
we
--
it
happened,
anyway,
the
application
for
stay
was
denied.
after
that
was
denied,
the
judicial
council
then
did
issue
a
second
order.
in
our
opinion,
this
order
did
not
call
for
the
type
of
hearing
that
had
been
represented
to
you,
gentlemen,
by
the
judicial
council
would
be
held.
judge
chandler
wasn't
ordered
to
come
to
any
hearing.
he
was
notified
that
a
hearing
would
be
held
and
that
if
he
wanted
to
appear,
he
might,
and
that
he
could
present
to
the
hearing
such
matters
as
he
deemed
desirable.
there
was
no
indication
of
any
charges
against
him.
he
wasn't
ordered.
the
county
was
told
he
could
bring
counsel
if
he
wanted.
well,
judge
chandler
advised
both
this
court
and
the
judicial
council
that
he
would
not
attend
such
a
hearing,
that
he
challenged
their
jurisdiction
to
remove
cases
from
him
and
upon
that,
the
judicial
council
then
decided
that
it
would
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
the
second
order
merely
called
for
the
hearing.
at
the
time
that
judge
chandler
stated
that
he
wouldn't
appear
at
the
hearing,
then
the
other
district
judges
in
judge
chandler's
court
then
advised
judge
chandler
that
the
original
order
had
ordered
them
to
re-divide
all
the
cases
in
the
court.
this
court
had
denied
his
application
for
stay.
it
appeared
that
we
were
in
for
a
long
session
with
respect
to
this
matter.
at
that
point,
the
district
judges
advised
judge
chandler
that
they
ought
to
do
something
with
respect
to
complying
to
the
first
order
of
the
judicial
council.
so
the
judges
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
it
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
the
judicial
council
is
given
the
authority
to
examine
the
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
courts
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
judicial
council
is
the
tenth
circuit
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
they've
done
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
circuit.
i
honestly
don't,
and
i
just
know
this
one
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that's
correct,
sir.
well,
after
the
district
judges
then
met
to
decide
upon
a
new
order
of
business
since
it
appeared
that
judge
chandler
was
going
to
require
some
time
to
settle
this
matter,
judge
chandler
disagreed
with
the
re-division
of
his
standing
cases,
those
already
assigned
to
him
among
the
other
judges.
and
he
did
agree
however
that
in
order
to
keep
this
matter
going
and
not
to
get
into
a
complete
brawl
with
the
members
of
the
district
court
who
were
only
trying
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
judicial
council
and
were
going
to
let
judge
chandler
contest
them,
he
agreed
that
he
wouldn't
hear
any
cases
assigned,
any
future
cases
filed
in
his
court,
although
he
did
not
believe
the
judicial
council
had
power
to
take
those
away
from
him,
but
he
disagreed
with
respect
to
reassigning
cases
already
assigned
to
him.
at
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
the
--
there
is
a
system
whereby
the
cases
are
arbitrarily
assigned
to
judges,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
as
they're
filed,
yes
sir,
by
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
after
this
new
division
of
order
was
entered
into,
the
judicial
council
then
did
this
next
strange
thing.
it
said
well,
we
now
have
power
under
section
137
to
allocate
cases
in
this
court
because
there's
a
disagreement
with
respect
to
the
division
of
cases
already
on
file
in
judge
chandler's
court,
judge
chandler
is
disagreeing
that
these
cases
can
be
reassigned.
therefore
--
and
this
was
their
decision
--
we're
going
to
let
the
present
situation
stand
as
to
existing
cases,
but
we're
going
to
re-divide
the
newly
filed
cases.
well,
it
didn't
make
any
sense
but
nevertheless,
that's
what
happened
and
they
superseded,
they
said,
the
old
order.
well,
gentlemen,
at
this
point
when
the
first
order
was
superseded,
what
we're
questioning
here
today
is
the
first
order.
there
are
other
facts
in
this
case
that
go
on,
which
facts
have
a
bearing
upon
whether
or
not
this
court
should
exercise
its
discretion,
which
the
granting
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
always
is,
because
these
further
facts
bear
upon
the
attitude
of
the
judicial
council
and
the
true
spirit
in
which
this
punitive
order
was
entered
into.
these
facts
can
be
boiled
down
basically
to
one
thing.
for
a
couple
of
years
thereafter,
the
judicial
council
went
through
an
elaborate
procedure,
designed
to
create
a
paper
record
that
they
were
acting
all
along
to
assist
judge
chandler
in
cleaning
up
a
crowded
docket.
they
got
documents
from
the
administrator
of
the
court
bearing
upon
his
case
load.
the
facts
were
from
the
very
beginning
judge
chandler's
case
load,
was
a
number
of
cases
less
than
he
normally
decides
in
a
year.
the
facts
are
that
when
the
first
order
was
issued,
there
was
no
mention
made
of
a
crowded
case
load.
this
was
an
afterthought
and
it
was
designed
by
the
judicial
council
to
try
to
detain
some
kind
of
firm
ground
upon
which
to
base
their
assault
on
judge
chandler.
your
honor,
we
came
here
and
we
based
the
jurisdiction
of
this
case
upon
the
all
writs
act.
there
is
a
very
excellent
inquiry
into
the
jurisdictional
problems
of
this
case
that
the
solicitor
general
has
in
his
brief,
and
also
the
counsel
for
the
respondent.
these
jurisdictional
problems
boil
down
basically
to
a
single
question.
for
instance,
both
solicitor
general
and
mr.
wright
do
not
disagree
that
the
all
writs
act
does
provide
authority
for
this
court
to
act.
they
disagree
only
on
the
constitutional
ground,
whether
or
not
this
case
is
within
the
appellate
powers
of
this
court
and
all
that
question
boils
down
to
one
point,
was
the
judicial
council
acting
as
a
lower
court
or
an
inferior
tribunal
rather
than
an
administrative
agency
in
this
proceeding?
solicitor
general
griswold
contends
that
it
was.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that
it
was
acting
as
a
court,
as
an
inferior
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
when
it
issued
this
order,
stripping
judge
chandler
of
his
powers.
he
contends
that
no
matter
what
their
nature,
that
they
were
acting
as
a
court
would
act.
now,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
congress
intended
that
the
judicial
council
be
an
administrative
agency.
i
agree
entirely
and
yet,
this
council
is
composed
of
judges
who
have
judicial
power
and
they
acted
in
a
way
that
judges
would
act,
and
i
contend
that
they
were
acting
with
the
judicial
powers
of
their
offices.
and
i
also
will
say
this
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
contend
that
the
judicial
conference
could
act
in
a
way
in
which
was
an
exercise
of
the
judicial
powers.
for
instance,
a
judicial
council
is
given
the
power
to
remove
a
referee
in
bankruptcy.
now,
this
is
the
exercise
of
judicial
powers.
it's
admitted
by
mr.
wright
that
it's
the
exercise
of
judicial
powers.
this
is
given
to
the
judicial
council
statutorily,
this
right.
so
congress
did
give
for
instance
to
a
judicial
council
at
least
one
specific
and
explicit
instance
of
the
right
to
exercise
judicial
powers.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
i
was
back
on
the
judicial
council,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes
sir,
the
council
--
the
council
by
statue
of
congress
is
given
the
authority
when
the
district
judges
cannot
agree
upon
the
removal
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy,
to
remove
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
of
their
court
upon
a
hearing,
and
this
is
provided
by
congress.
so
it
shows
that
in
this
one
statute
that
the
congress
does
believe
that
a
judicial
council
can't
act
with
the
judicial
powers
that
the
judges
have.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
sir?
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
that
is
cited
in
mr.
wright's
brief,
the
section
--
the
statute
--
i
don't
recall
a
particular
statute
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
at
this
instant,
but
it
is
cited
in
there.
it's
a
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
your
honor,
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
removal
of
a
bankruptcy
--
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy?
well,
your
honor,
this
referee
in
bankruptcy
is
acting
over
cases
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
but
those
are
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir.
he's
performing
an
executive
function
when
he
does
that
because
these
lesser
officers
are
exercising
part
of
the
executive
powers
given
to
the
president.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
if
the
judicial
officer
is
able
to
employ
discretion
in
the
performance
of
his
duties,
which
discretion
you
would
ordinarily
think
are
those
of
a
judge,
then
i
would
say
that
judicial
power
is
concerned.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
there,
i
think
that's
an
administrative
assistance
to
the
judge.
he
has
full
power
to
remove
his
law
clerk
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
by
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
court
is
appointing
an
officer
to
perform
certain
judicial
functions.
i
think
the
referee
performs
judicial
functions.
i
think
it's
a
very
high
honor
for
--
for
a
lawyer
to
be
appointed
to
this.
it
certainly
is
in
assistance
of
the
judges
of
the
court
in
their
carrying
out
their
judicial
functions
and
i
think
that
when
a
judicial
council
acts
to
remove
from
a
judge
all
of
his
power
to
hear
and
decide
cases
that
now,
we
have
the
strongest
possible
instance
when
someone
is
exercising
judicial
power.
your
honor,
the
main
thing
is
the
--
is
this
section
332
which
set
up
judicial
councils
and
what
it
means.
and
i
want
to
direct
this
court's
attention
to
i
think
the
most
significant
part
of
this
case,
and
that
is,
what
is
the
meaning
of
section
332
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
1948
when
there
was
a
revision
of
the
judicial
code
that
there
were
important
changes
made
that
slipped
by
the
congress
in
such
a
manner
that
congressional
intent
could
not
have
been
involved
and
that
these
changes
cannot
be
the
law.
the
committee
report
in
1948
stated,
and
it
was
only
eight
pages
long
with
a
big
appendix
to
--
of
the
reviser's
notes.
the
committee
report
said,
“the
reviser's
notes
are
akin
to
the
sections
of
the
revision
and
explain
in
detail
every
change
made
in
the
past.”
now,
that's
the
notice
given
to
the
congress.
the
reviser's
notes
on
section
332
said,
“changes
in
phraseology
were
made,”
there
were
two
other
remarks,
but
they
don't
bear
upon
this
case.
well,
your
honor,
if
you
will
compare
the
1939
statute,
which
was
the
original
one,
and
the
1948
statute,
and
i
have
these
two
statutes
laid
out
side
by
side
on
page
13
of
my
brief.
i
think
that
you
can
see
what
violence
was
done
to
the
1939
statute.
now,
the
1939
statute
has
cohesion
and
builds
logically
from
first,
the
calling
of
council
meetings
to
second,
the
submission
to
the
meetings
of
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
court
reports,
next,
to
the
taking
of
action
thereon
by
the
council,
and
finally,
notice
to
the
district
judges
of
their
duty
to
promptly
carry
out
the
directions
of
the
council
as
to
the
administration
of
business
of
their
courts.
your
honors,
in
the
1948
revised
version,
there's
been
a
lot
said
about
the
fact
that
the
word
“order”
was
substituted
for
the
word
“directions,”
that
that's
not
the
principal
change
that
was
made.
the
principal
change
made
is
that
in
the
1948
act,
the
judicial
council
was
given
two
sources
of
authority.
in
the
1939
act,
it
was
given
a
single
source
of
authority.
the
1948
act
in
the
third
paragraph,
continues
as
the
1939
act
did,
talks
about
the
quarterly
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
courts
and
then
says,
“the
council
shall
take
such
action
thereon
as
may
be
necessary.”
there
is
a
source
of
power
for
judicial
councils.
then
it
breaks
a
paragraph
and
it
commences
with
the
final
paragraph,
and
it
commences
with
a
second
source
of
power,
which
the
1939
act
didn't
have.
it
says,
“each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
administration
of
the
business
of
the
courts
within
its
circuit.”
it's
got
two
statements
of
authority;
the
1939
act
had
one
and
now,
the
sentence
about
the
judges
carrying
into
effect
that
directions
or
orders,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it,
this
section
is
put
at
the
bottom
after
the
second
source
of
power
of
judicial
councils.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
said
about
the
powers
of
judicial
councils
being
just
about
plenary,
and
i
can
see
why
because
when
this
1948
revision
was
made,
there
was
slipped
into
this
statute
in
the
revis
--
in
the
revising
process,
two
sources
of
power
for
judicial
councils,
and
that
was
not
the
intent
in
the
1939
act.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
sir,
it
was
a
very
complicated
and
extended
procedure.
the
actual
revising
of
the
code;
the
bar
was
involved,
the
judges
were
involved,
the
justices
were
involved,
law
professors
were
involved.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
my
memory
may
be
faulty
,but
with
all
due
respect,
i
do
not
believe
you
are
correct.
the
change
that
was
made
was
made
in
the
house
in
the
1948
revision,
this
was
a
house
bill.
the
particular
statement
you're
referring
to
about
the
act
has
not
teeth
in
it
occurred
in
hearings
before
the
senate
in
the
1939
enactment.
in
1948,
the
act
originated
in
the
house,
was
placed
on
the
consent
calendar
of
the
house
whereby
it
goes
through
automatically
because
the
committee
report
says
there
really
aren't
any
substantive
changes
made
in
the
old
law,
and
congressmen
are
given
this
very
slight
notice
of
this
act
is
intended
to
change
law
and
the
appendix
even
said
in
the
house
report
that
the
law
wasn't
changed
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
that
was
the
intention
of
their
questioning.
they
did
ask
the
question
and
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
chief
justice
groner
or
someone
who
--
i
don't
believe
it
was
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
said
in
their
opinion,
there
were
sufficient
teeth
because
if
the
judicial
council
made
a
direction
that
it
would
be
carried
out
quite
naturally
and
that
no
further
words
were
needed.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
desolation
of
the
1939
discussion
about
were
teeth
needed.
i
think
that
people
may
have
been
concerned
at
the
time
whether
or
not
they
could
put
additional
teeth
in
there
if
it
came
to
a
point
of
taking
a
judge's
cases
away
from
him.
well,
sir,
your
honor,
the
--
i
think
the
history
of
the
1939
act
really
is
a
history
which
shows
that
what
was
really
intended
to
be
done
in
1939
was
to
set
up
an
administrative
procedure
for
the
courts
to
take
away
from
the
attorney
general
the
necessity
of
attending
to
these
details.
they
provided
the
administrator
of
the
u.s.
court,
a
new
office
and
they
tied
to
the
judicial
council
the
preparation
of
these
--
this
data
gathering
and
statistics
compiling
reports
of
the
administrator
of
the
courts
and
submitting
these
to
the
councils
and
the
councils
acting
thereon,
and
then
issuing
directions
to
the
judges
who
shall
carry
out
the
directions,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
as
to
the
administration
of
the
business
of
their
respective
courts.
i
contend
that
the
1948
revision,
because
of
the
committee
report,
which
is
the
true
legislative
history
of
any
enactment,
because
of
the
reviser's
notes,
the
changes
in
phraseology
were
made;
that's
all.
i
contend
the
original
intention
of
1939
controlled
and
that
the
two
sources
of
authority
for
judicial
councils
to
act
now
don't
really
change
what
the
law
is
because
that
wasn't
the
intention
of
congress,
congress
didn't
intend
to
change
the
law.
your
honor,
i
notice
that
the
judicial
conference
in
1961
issued
a
report
entitled
“the
powers
and
responsibilities
of
the
judicial
councils.”
this
was
a
very
elaborate
document.
someone
got
chairman
celler
to
print
it
as
a
house
document,
and
it's
a
fine
and
elaborate
defense
of
the
judicial
councils.
in
fact,
it
even
appears
to
me
as
its
an
attempt
to
take
care
of
any
weaknesses
in
the
authority
of
judicial
councils.
this
report
immediately
focuses
on
the
ninth
--
the
first
thing
it
does
is
talk
about
the
1948
revision
and
particularly,
the
change
of
word
of
“directions”
to
“orders.”
now,
that's
strengthening
word
but
that
isn't
a
significant
thing.
nevertheless,
the
judicial
conference
says,
“the
changes
are
one
of
form
and
emphasis
rather
than
substance.”
no
change
in
substance
has
occurred.
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
judicial
conference
in
1961.
it's
important
that
that
document
makes
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
1948
statute
carries
two
sources
of
powers
for
the
judicial
council
whereby
the
1939
act
only
carried
one.
i
submit
the
--
there's
been
no
change
in
the
--
any
intention
of
congress.
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there's
another
issue
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
taking
all
the
cases
from
a
judge,
all
the
cases,
is
tantamount
to
impeachment
and
i
think
there's
a
very
serious
question
here.
the
constitution
gave
the
impeachment
powers
to
the
house
and
to
the
senate.
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
impeach
this
--
i
mean
the
house
--
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachments.
i
think
the
history
of
the
constitution
shows
that
there
was
no
intention
to
provide
any
other
means
for
removing
a
federal
judge
from
the
bench.
federal
judges
were
given
their
offices
during
good
behavior
and
yet
the
federalist
in
its
number
78
and
79,
devotes
itself
to
proving
how
important
judicial
independence
is
to
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people,
and
how
the
constitution
secures
that.
it
talks
about
then
about
the
impeachment
powers
of
the
house
and
senate
and
says,
“this
is
the
only
provision
on
the
point
which
is
consistent
with
the
necessary
independence
of
the
judicial
carrier.”
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
they
did
initially,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
they
did
supersede
it,
but
then
they
kept
him
from
hearing
any
cases
later
filed
in
his
court
and
furthermore,
they
pressured
him
into
all
of
this,
your
honor,
that
they've
been
acting
against
him
ever
since
the
first
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir
--
you
are
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
the
order
has
been
superseded
because
of
the
continuation
of
the
council
to
act
and
because
of
the
importance
to
the
judiciary
of
whether
they
can
do
this.
since
the
judicial
council
merely
only
has
to
supersede
any
order
when
challenged,
we
think
that
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
this
court
to
issue
mandamus
to
the
judicial
council,
to
order
them
not
to
do
this
anymore
and
to
cease
any
vestiges
of
its
action
against
judge
chandler
otherwise,
this
question
can
never
be
litigated,
so
it
meant
some
importance
to
the
judiciary.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
his
exact
situation,
your
honor,
is
that
he
has
the
remnants
of
four
or
five
cases
that
had
been
assigned
to
him
before
this
matter
arose,
that
he
has
the
remnants
of
those
still
in
his
office.
he
has
heard
the
rest
of
the
cases
that
had
been
assigned
to
him.
he
and
the
other
judges
of
his
court
have
agreed
that
no
further
cases
will
be
assigned
to
him
under
the
circumstances
of
this
matter
being
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
he
disagreed.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
that
order
was
in
effect
until
several
months
ago
when
the
judicial
council
advised
the
members
--
the
other
judges
of
judge
chandler's
court
and
him
that
if
they
wish
to
enter
into
a
new
order
for
the
division
of
business,
they
might
do
so.
the
judges
considered
it
and
stated
that
under
the
circumstances,
they
will
allow
the
existing
order
to
continue.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
for
him
to
--
yes
sir,
i
would
it
was
beyond
their
power.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
judicial
council
can
--
cannot
--
can
make
such
an
order
as
to
take
away
all
the
cases
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
purported
to,
yes
sir,
and
we
challenge
that
decision
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
oh!
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
judge
--
the
--
any
disagreement
in
judge
chandler's
court
was
forced
upon
the
judges
by
the
judicial
council.
they
questioned
his
fit
--
they
came
before
this
court
and
said,
“well,
we
might
have
to
act
under
372
(b).
he
may
be
mentally
disabled”
and
yet,
they
turned
right
around
thereafter
and
say,
“well,
it's
alright
for
him
to
hear
all
the
cases
assigned
to
him.”
this
whole
thing,
there
is
one
cohesive
thing.
this
has
been
a
struggle
between
the
judicial
council
and
judge
chandler,
and
has
continued
down
to
this
moment.
and
when
the
judicial
council
offered
to
the
members
of
judge
chandler's
court
the
ability
finally
to
enter
into
a
new
order
dividing
the
business
of
their
court
without
interference
of
the
judicial
council,
the
judges
of
this
court
said,
“under
the
circumstances,
the
present
order
will
stand.”
the
present
order
still
stands,
but
is
agreeable
to
the
members
of
his
court
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
is
not
my
contention
that
section
137
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
it's
quite
constitutional,
your
honor.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
the
congressional
intent
behind
137
was
that
the
judicial
council
can
divide
the
cases
of
a
district
court
in
the
event
of
a
genuine
disagreement
of
the
judges
of
that
court
as
to
the
manner
of
dividing
the
cases.
this
is
not
a
genuine
disagreement,
this
is
one
that
the
judicial
council
created.
it
created
the
disagreement.
i
don't
think
that
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
would
agree,
your
honor
that's
perfectly
fine.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
said
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
the
section
137
certainly
superficially
authorizes
the
second
order
of
the
judicial
council
because
the
judges
were
disagreeing.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
that's
alright.
that's
the
type
of
disagreement
that
the
--
that
section
137
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
you
mean
with
respect
to
the
judicial
council
removing
the
ability
of
a
judge
to
hear
any
cases
thereafter?
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
then
they
removed
from
his
office.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
effectively
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
he
just
has
the
remnants
of
a
few
cases
around.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
that
is
just
exactly
what
i
am
saying
the
judicial
council
cannot
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
first
of
all,
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir,
they
cannot
do
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
because
it
--
is
tantamount
to
impeachment.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
i
suggest
that
is
a
judicial
power,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
what
is
--
what
is
involved
there
is
--
is
a
legitimate
determination
that
a
judge
is
overworked
under
the
circumstances.
he
has
a
crowded
docket
and
he
should
refrain
temporarily
in
taking
on
new
cases,
but
there,
we
have
the
facts
supporting
that,
your
honor.
in
a
case
at
bar,
i
contend
we
don't
have
the
facts
supporting
it
and
without
the
factual
basis
for
it,
then
that
makes
the
difference
between
constitutionality
and
unconstitutionality.
your
hypothetical
is
quite
constitutional
until
the
judge
catches
up.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
just
believe
that
--
that
taking
cases
away
from
a
judge
is
a
judicial
action.
it
certainly
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
to
tell
you
the
truth
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
we
may
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
well,
it
--
it
may
be
we
should
draw
a
fine
line
here,
that
with
respect
to
future
cases,
it's
an
administrative
decision
because
the
judge's
powers
have
not
yet
been
invoked.
but
with
respect
to
cases
already
assigned
to
the
judge
that
are
moving
through
the
judicial
process
upon
which
hearings
have
been
held,
matters
are
ready
for
final
determination,
then
they
pluck
a
case
away
from
a
judge
involves
the
judicial
process.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
judge
chandler
is
contesting
the
right
of
the
judicial
council
to
deny
him
the
right
to
participate
in
the
judicial
process.
he
had
over
a
hundred
cases
already
assigned
to
him,
some
were
moving
towards
final
judgment.
he
was
ordered
to
retire
from
those
cases.
the
appellate
powers
of
the
court
were
involved,
and
judge
chandler
has
contested
the
right
of
this
body
to
take
him
out
of
those
cases.
there
is
your
controversy.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
your
honor,
i
will
concede
that,
but
i
want
to
make
a
careful
point
here.
in
my
opinion,
the
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
judicial
councils
in
this
type
of
matter
only
administrative
powers.
i
believe
that
the
judicial
council,
which
also
has
some
judicial
powers,
exceeded
its
powers
and
assumed
judicial
powers.
it
is
a
court
and
i
believe
that
it
should
be
confined
to
the
proper
exercise
of
its
powers
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
--
but
it
was
exercised
--
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
it
--
the
members
of
the
council
are
members
of
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
yes,
sir,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
thomas
j.
kenan
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
didn't.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that,
your
honor.
i
said
that
members
of
the
council
are
members
of
a
court
and
when
they
act
with
the
full
cloak
of
their
office
around
them,
sign
their
orders,
circuit
judge,
file
them
in
the
court
records,
get
marshals
to
serve
them,
remove
a
judge
from
cases,
they're
acting
as
judges.
they're
involved
in
the
judicial
process.
they
should
be
confined
to
the
rightful
exercise
of
their
--
of
their
duties.
