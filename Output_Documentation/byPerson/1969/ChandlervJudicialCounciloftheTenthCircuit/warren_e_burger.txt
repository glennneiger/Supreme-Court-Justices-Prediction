chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chandler
against
the
judicial
council.
good
morning,
mr.
kenan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
--
how
do
you
discern
the
form
in
which
they
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
all
the
judges
--
all
of
the
circuit
judges
of
a
given
circuit
assemble
and
meet
to
address
themselves
to
any
business
other
than
an
en
banc
hearing,
are
they
not
acting
as
a
judicial
council?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
judicial
councils
meet
once
a
month,
sometimes
twice
a
month,
sometimes
three
times
a
month,
depending
on
the
nature
and
the
quantity
of
the
administrative
problems
they
have
before
them.
i'm
speaking
now
of
me
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
a
counsel,
not
on
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would
not
suggest
that
other
meetings
were
not
meetings
of
the
council
if
they
go
beyond
two
meetings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i
was
confused
then
by
your
comment
about
the
signatures
that
the
signed
as
circuit
judges
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
of
course,
they
hold
their
place
on
the
council
only
by
virtue
of
their
being
the
circuit
judges,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
the
same,
mr.
kenan,
with
respect
to
the
judges
sitting
on
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
which
is
also
a
statutory
body?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
meant
the
judicial
conference
there,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
specific
judicial
power
which
has
been
vested
in
those
terms
in
the
judicial
council
to
which
you
were
referring?
the
council
now
as
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
his
law
clerk,
if
he
dismisses
a
law
clerk
or
a
secretary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
get
his
position
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
judicial
act
when
the
court
appoints
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
recall
the
details
of
how
that
sent
--
last
sentence
happened
to
get
in
there
in
the
legislative
history?
i
don't
know
whether
you've
covered
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
speaking
of
the
specific
sentence.
was
that,
my
recollection
may
be
faulty,
but
my
recollection
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
time
of
the
matter
was
before
the
committee
of
the
judiciary
of
the
senate,
some
senators
raised
the
question
that
this
statute,
proposed
section
332,
had
no
teeth
in
it,
had
no
teeth.
and
either
a
senator
or
a
staff
member,
someone
then
reached
into
the
1939
act
and
added
this
modification,
which
is
the
last
sentence
of
the
1948
amendment.
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
it's
in
the
1939,
even
though
this
occurred
in
the
1939
setting
or
the
1948
setting,
it
was
in
the
setting
of
members
of
the
senate
who
have
thought
the
statute
had
to
be
strengthened
to
give
bigger
authority
to
the
council.
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
back
that
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
kenan.
suppose
you
have
a
judge
who
has
not
decided
any
of
his
cases
for
five
years
and
he's
holding
these
cases,
and
this
is
an
extreme
case.
now,
i'm
suggesting
this
hypothesis
and
not
your
case
here.
five
years
has
gone
by
and
he
hasn't
decided
any
of
his
cases,
and
the
litigants
are
clamoring
for
action
and
the
council
--
the
other
judges
then
on
division,
first
under
section
137
decide
that
he
gets
no
more
new
cases
until
he
gets
his
old
business
taken
cared
of.
now,
i
understood
your
responses
previously
were,
that
that
is
a
lawful
power
vested
in
the
courts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
--
do
you
suggest
that's
a
judicial
power
or
an
administrative
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
can
do
it
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
involve
--
does
it
meet
the
standards
of
case
or
controversy
under
the
constitution,
this
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shipley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shipley
--
mr.
shipley
before
you
go
on
with
that,
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
now
addressed
yourself
to
the
possibility
that
certain
actions
under
1
--
section
137
might
be
lawful
in
the
sense
that
they're
authorized
by
the
statute
and
they're
authorized
by
the
constitution,
i
take
it.
if
they
are
to
get
on
with
the
business
of
the
court,
but
that
in
this
case,
you
then
raise
a
question
of
whether
that
was
the
good
faith
purpose.
are
there
any
findings?
has
there
been
any
determination
by
anyone
that
we
could
review
to
determine
whether
they
were
in
good
faith
or
in
bad
faith?
how
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
this
court
review
that
issue,
your
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
recital
comes
from
what
the
council
said,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
still
at
a
loss
as
to
just
how
or
where
there
is
something
we
could
review
that
would
shed
any
light
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
good
faith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
five
minutes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
--
you
have
--
you
have
just
one
minute
left,
mr.
shipley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
it's
up
--
over
the
five,
yes.
the
remainder
is
reserved
for
a
rebuttal
i
take
it,
by
mr.
kenan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
shipley.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
--
that's
why
you
take
the
position
that
the
case
isn't
here,
that
case
isn't
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
a
division
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
could
not
deprive
of
the
prerequisites
of
office
in
the
form
of
his
compensation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislative
history
behind
that
statute
indicates
that
congress
concluded
that
there
should
be
means
of
relieving
the
public
and
the
litigants
from
a
disabled
judge
short
of
impeachment
but
without
taking
the
office
of
judge
or
the
salary
away
from
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
statute
is
not
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
has
--
do
i
understand
that
as
to
the
division
of
the
cases
after
that,
he
has
agreed
with
the
other
judges
of
his
court,
is
that
correct
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
all
just
deal
with
that
case
when
it
reaches
here,
of
course,
can't
we,
professor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
professor
wright.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
then
what
we
sometimes
--
or
as
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
true
friend
of
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
any
statute
relating
to
the
judicial
councils
in
their
formation
refer
to
them
as
sitting
en
banc
in
those
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
you
think
the
statue
permits
the
council
to
meet
in
executive
private
session
on
public
not
open
to
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
--
are
you
then
suggesting
they
can
carry
out
a
judicial
function
in
other
than
a
public
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
processes
are
always
preceded
by
an
opportunity
of
argument
in
briefing
and
great
many
other
things,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
argument
in
writing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
is
an
en
banc
court
convened?
how
does
it
come
into
being
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
a
court
en
banc
in
the
judicial
sense,
five
votes,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
will
assume
i'm
correct
in
stating
that
this
statute
requires
that
it
takes
five
votes
to
convene
a
court
en
banc
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
--
if
it's
a
nine-man
court,
the
majority
of
the
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
takes
the
majority
of
the
court
to
convene
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
the
statute,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
does
have
authority
to
convene
on
his
own
initiative
the
council,
does
he
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
section
--
the
situation
you
pose
would
arise
equally,
would
it
not,
if
without
anything
entering
any
order
to
that
effect,
they
simply
all
refuse
to
do
any
work.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
isn't
the
order
that
triggers
this,
it's
the
conduct,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
thank
you,
mr.
kenan
and
mr.
shipley.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chandler
against
the
judicial
council.
good
morning,
mr.
kenan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
--
how
do
you
discern
the
form
in
which
they
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
all
the
judges
--
all
of
the
circuit
judges
of
a
given
circuit
assemble
and
meet
to
address
themselves
to
any
business
other
than
an
en
banc
hearing,
are
they
not
acting
as
a
judicial
council?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
judicial
councils
meet
once
a
month,
sometimes
twice
a
month,
sometimes
three
times
a
month,
depending
on
the
nature
and
the
quantity
of
the
administrative
problems
they
have
before
them.
i'm
speaking
now
of
me
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
a
counsel,
not
on
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would
not
suggest
that
other
meetings
were
not
meetings
of
the
council
if
they
go
beyond
two
meetings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
i
was
confused
then
by
your
comment
about
the
signatures
that
the
signed
as
circuit
judges
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
of
course,
they
hold
their
place
on
the
council
only
by
virtue
of
their
being
the
circuit
judges,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
the
same,
mr.
kenan,
with
respect
to
the
judges
sitting
on
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
which
is
also
a

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
meant
the
judicial
conference
there,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
specific
judicial
power
which
has
been
vested
in
those
terms
in
the
judicial
council
to
which
you
were
referring?
the
council
now
as
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
his
law
clerk,
if
he
dismisses
a
law
clerk
or
a
secretary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
get
his
position
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
judicial
act
when
the

appoints
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
recall
the
details
of
how
that
sent
--
last
sentence
happened
to
get
in
there
in
the
legislative
history?
i
don't
know
whether
you've
covered
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
speaking
of
the
specific
sentence.
was
that,
my
recollection
may
be
faulty,
but
my
recollection
of
the

is
that
the

of
the

and
either
a

someone
then
reached
into
the
1939
act
and
added
this
modification,
which
is
the
last
sentence
of
the
1948
amendment.
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whether
it's
in
the
1939,
even
though
this
occurred
in
the
1939
setting
or
the
1948
setting,
it
was

of

e.

does

chief

mr.

chief

e.

mr.

--
mr.
shipley
before
you
go
on
with
that,
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
chief

warren
e.

you
have
now
addressed
yourself
to
the
possibility
that
certain
actions
under

might
be
lawful
in
the
sense
that

i
take
it.
if
they
are
to
get

that
in

you

that
the
case
isn't
here,
that
case
isn't
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
a
division
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
could
not
deprive
of
the
prerequisites
of
office
in
the
form
of
his
compensation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislative
history
behind
that
statute
indicates
that
congress
concluded
that
there
should
be
means
of
relieving
the
public
and
the
litigants
from
a
disabled
judge
short
of
impeachment
but
without
taking
the
office
of
judge
or
the
salary
away
from
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
statute
is
not
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
has
--
do
i
understand
that
as
to
the
division
of
the
cases
after
that,
he
has
agreed
with
the
other
judges
of
his
court,
is
that
correct
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
all
just
deal
with
that
case
when
it
reaches
here,
of
course,
can't
we,
professor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
professor
wright.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
then
what
we
sometimes
--
or
as
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
true
friend
of
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
any
statute
relating
to
the
judicial
councils
in
their
formation
refer
to
them
as
sitting
en
banc
in
those
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
you
think
the
statue
permits
the
council
to
meet
in
executive
private
session
on
public
not
open
to
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
--
are
you
then
suggesting
they
can
carry
out
a
judicial
function
in
other
than
a
public
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
processes
are
always
preceded
by
an
opportunity
of
argument
in
briefing
and
great
many
other
things,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
argument
in
writing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
is
an
en
banc
court
convened?
how
does
it
come
into
being
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
a
court
en
banc
in
the
judicial
sense,
five
votes,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
will
assume
i'm
correct
in
stating
that
this
statute
requires
that
it
takes
five
votes
to
convene
a
court
en
banc
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
--
if
it's
a
nine-man
court,
the
majority
of
the
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
takes
the
majority
of
the
court
to
convene
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
the
statute,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
does
have
authority
to
convene
on
his
own
initiative
the
council,
does
he
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
section
--
the
situation
you
pose
would
arise
equally,
would
it
not,
if
without
anything
entering
any
order
to
that
effect,
they
simply
all
refuse
to
do
any
work.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
isn't
the
order
that
triggers
this,
it's
the
conduct,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
thank
you,
mr.
kenan
and
mr.
shipley.
the
case
is
submitted.
