justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
inferior
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
cited
in
your
brief,
that
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
want
to
understand
what
you
are
saying.
are
you
saying
that
the
judicial
council
has
constitutional
authority
to
tell
a
federal
district
judge
appointed
for
life
that
he
can't
try
any
more
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
constitution,
not
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about,
do
you
say
that
they
can
do
that
under
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
rather
thought
that
the
judicial
duty
of
a
judge
was
to
try
lots
of
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
where
he's
in
a
trial
of
a
lawsuit,
in
that
administrative
action
that
you
were
talking
about,
which
you
call
judicial
and
which
i
would
call
administrative?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
a
judicial
action?
are
they
trying
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they're
not
trying
the
case
loads,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say,
is
a
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
members
of
the
council
are
judges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
the
members
are,
as
a
group,
constitute
a
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been,
you
concede
that
the
council
of
judges
would
have
had
right
to
call
judge
chandler
before
them
and
try
him
to
see
whether
or
not
he
was
tending
to
his
business
efficiently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
conceding
that
the
court
has
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
such
an
inherent
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
conceding
that
even
this
court
would
have
such
an
inherent
authority
to
test
the
conduct
of
federal
judges
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
council
--
suppose
the
council
issued
an
order
and
he
refused
to
obey
it,
do
you
agree
then
that
you
could
be
--
anything
done
to
him,
or
do
you
agree
with
what
mr.
vanderbilt
and
judge
groner
said
in
the
hearing
that
that
would
be
perfectly
just
cause
of
a
remedy
and
method
of
impeachment
as
provided
by
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
believe
that
there's
any
other
way
to
try
it,
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
five
minutes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
had
gone
against
the
judge
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals?
would
he
have
had
to
go
to
the
district
court
to
try
to
assert
his
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
it
has
inherent
power,
well,
i
suppose
it
has.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
believe
though
you,
mr.
wright?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
a
statute
because
i
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals,
and
they
had
removed
it
because
the
court
of
appeals
judge
the
council
has,
would
he
have
to
go
to
the
district
court
to
assert
his
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
suppose
it
was
about
his
right
to
try
cases,
would
he
then
have
to
go
to
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
impeachment
provision
of
the
constitution
for
it?
what
purpose
would
it
serve?
justice
hugo
l.
black
appointed
judges
barred
of
his
right
to
act
as
a
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can't
rely
on
a
provision
of
the
constitution
whereby
he
can
automatically
be
removed
by
impeachment.
removal
has
taken
away
the
right
to
try
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
that's
not
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
this
court
has
held
where
it
was
a
point
to
be
decided
in
a
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
someone
disagrees
with
you
as
i
do?
i
think
the
question
is
here
but
you
say
it's
not
here,
in
your
judgment,
is
the
action
of
the
council
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
suppose
you
are
wrong
about
what's
here
as
i
think
you
are,
and
maybe
i
don't
know
whether
any
others
think
so
or
not,
but
i
certainly
do,
is
that
--
was
that
act
of
the
council
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
could
temporarily
strip
the
judge
of
his
power
to
try
cases
under
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
although
the
constitution
provides
a
way
to
remove
judges,
you
think
it's
because
of
the
necessity,
might
have
somebody
judgment
prior
he
could
be
removed
without
impeachment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
the
only
way
he's
granted
independence
is
by
getting
his
compensation?
do
you
think
that's
all
our
constitution
means
about
the
independence
of
judges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
president
of
united
states
in
your
judgment
has
the
power
on
our
constitution
to
determine
whether
a
judge
is
mentally
able
to
try
his
cases?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
understand
you
now.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
it
was
negligent
enough
to
leave
it
to
be
determined
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
a
political
officer
to
decide
whether
judges
are
able
to
hold
their
jobs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
not
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
this
case
is
not
here
at
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
have
been
allotted,
the
only
ones
he'd
been
left
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he's
a
judge
appointed
for
life
whom
the
litigants
can't
depend
on
to
try
their
cases
because
other
judges
who
are
no
more
lifetime
judges
than
he,
have
decided
that
it
shouldn't
take
them
without
any
authority,
express
authority
of
law,
unless
it
could
be
drawn
through
vague
provisions
of
the
administrative
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
someone
might
call
a
shotgun
wedding
--
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
when
they
meant
without
his
being
there
and
(inaudible)
how
can
you
say
that?
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
has
been
a
statement
for
many
years
in
which
many
people
give
some
confidence,
that
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
someone
--
some
of
us
think
it's
here
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
indicated
a
moment
ago
that
the
names
of
the
judges
--
famous
judge
whose
names
were
involved
had
passed
on
this
question?
in
what
cases
did
they
pass
on
the
question
before
us?
justice

do
you

that's
on
--
justice

the
question
we
have
before
us?
