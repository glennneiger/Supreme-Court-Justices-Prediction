justice

stewart
how
many
judges
are
there
in
that
district,
mr.
kenan?
justice
potter
stewart
a
senior
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kenan,
i've
seen
the
order
quoted,
excerpts
from
it
quoted
and
described
in
these
various
briefs.
do
we
have
a
copy
of
the
order?
justice
potter
stewart
section
300,
in
the
last
paragraph
of
section
332,
whether
advertently
or
inadvertently,
congress
provided
only
that
district
judges
shall
properly
carry
into
effect
all
orders
of
the
judicial
council,
it
does
not
mention
circuit
judges.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
--
your
argument
is
made
upon
the
premise
that
judicial
council
has
taken
all
the
cases
away
from
him.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
initially,
but
that
was
superseded.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
am
i
incorrect
in
my
understanding
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument,
all
those
arguments,
but
am
i
incorrect
in
my
understanding
that
their
action
taking
all
the
cases
away
from
him
was
superseded?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
incorrect
in
that,
am
i?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right
in
that
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
so
then,
any
argument
based
upon
the
premise
that
there's
an
outstanding
order
taking
all
the
cases
away
from
him
is
based
upon
incorrect
premise,
am
i
correct,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
it
your
contention
that
what
you
call
the
present
order,
which
was
promulgated
under
section
137,
is
not
authorized
by
section
137,
or
is
it
your
position
that
if
authorized
by
137,
then
section
137
is
unconstitutional
as
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
a
genuine
--
a
genuine
disagreement
among
the
district
judges.
would
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
power
of
the
judicial
council
to
make
such
an
order
as
was
made
here,
that
is
that
no
new
cases
shall
be
assigned
to
judge
a
and
all
new
cases
shall
be
assigned
and
divided
among
judges
b,
c,
and
d?
justice
potter
stewart
if
section
137
does
authorize
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
council
will
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
that's
a
constitutional
power?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
when
that
point's
raised
--
reached,
you
might
have
a
different
case,
but
that
point
has
not
yet
been
reached
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede,
mr.
kenan,
that
if
this
was
administrative
action
rather
than
judicial
action
by
the
judicial
council
of
the
circuit
that
this
court
is
entirely
without
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
would
be
true
by
the
member
of
this
court.
if
some
administrative
action
were
taken
against
him
that
he
didn't
like,
if
this
court
--
not
just
because
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
this
court,
it
doesn't
change
the
basic
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
exactly
what
the
statute
provides,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
this
statute,
but
you
were
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
the
constitution
did
an
addition
to
providing
for
an
independent
judiciary
also
provides
for
good
many
other
rather
important
things
and
one
of
them
is
the
right
of
litigants
to
get
due
process
of
law,
and
presumably
you
can't
get
that
from
a
mentally
incompetent
or
physically
incompetent
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
judges
are
there
in
that

mr.
kenan?
justice
