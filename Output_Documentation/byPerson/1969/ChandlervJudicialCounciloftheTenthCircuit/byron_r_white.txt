justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
that
a
judicial
function,
the
removal
of
an
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
is
removal,
why
is
that
a
judicial
function
necessarily?
i
suppose
the
president
has
the
power
to
remove
from
office
various
members
of
the
executive
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
and
when
he
does
that,
he's
performing
a
judicial
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
when
a
judge,
a
district
judge
removes
a
--
removes
a
probation
officer,
he's
exercising
a
judicial
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
backed
up
by
an
order
of
the
judicial
council
because
the
time
he
agreed
to
that,
he
disagreed
with
the
reassignment
of
cases
that
he
already
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judicial
council
then
entered
an
order,
didn't
it,
saying
that
he
can
keep
his
old
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
he
can't
have
any
new
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
order
still
outstanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
judge
chandler
said,
“i
want
to
be
assigned
my
full
quota
of
the
cases”
and
the
other
two
judges
disagreed
and
said
the
present
division
should
continue,
then
there
would
be
a
disagreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
assume
then
that
the
council,
the
judicial
council
entered
an
order,
saying
no
new
cases.
would
you
say
that
was
beyond
their
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
grounds
that
you're
using
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
purported
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you
--
i
don't
know
why
you
think
the
--
you
think
you
have
to
argue
about
the
old
order
when
there's
a
--
when
the
superseded
order
--
i
mean
the
order
superseding
the
old
order
is
in
accordance
with
your
approach
just
to
suspect
as
the
old
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
–
i
thought
awhile
ago,
you
said
that
the
judicial
council
could
not
have
ordered
saying
that
a
judge
could
not
have
any
new
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
a
--
and
you
say
that
one
--
and
you
say
that
section
137
did
not
authorize
what
the
judicial
council
did
in
this
case
by
saying
no
to
new
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
assume
that
137
does
authorize
the
second
order
of
the
council,
i
assume
that
you
would
say
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
assume
that
it
does.
is
it
constitutional
or
the
--
the
two
district
judges
say
who
declared,
“we
don't
like
the
way
you're
deciding
cases.
we
don't
think
you
ought
any
more
to
be
assigned
the
cases”
and
then,
the
third
judge
says,
“well,
i
think
i
ought
to
have
my
quota
of
the
cases.”
then,
it
goes
to
the
council
and
the
council
says,
“well,
you
can't
have
any
more
cases.
we'll
bring
you
to
a
new
case.”
now,
assuming
137
authorizes
that,
you
nevertheless
say
its
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know,
but
what
about
the
constitutionality
of
section
137
if
so
construed
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
soon
as
he
heard
had
lot
of
cases
he
isn't
going
to
be
hearing
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
professor,
what
would
you
say
if
there
was
a
disagreement
and
there
was
a
council
order
saying
that
a
judge
should
first
clean
up
all
of
his
cases
before
he
takes
any
more?
that
order
goes
into
effect
and
he
does
clean
up
his
cases
and
then
he
wants
a
change
in
the
order.
the
other
district
judges
don't
want
any
change
in
the
order.
so
there's
a
disagreement
and
the
tenth
--
and
the
council
then
says,
“we
will
have
the
order
stand,
no
more
cases.”
is
that
within
the
reach
of
137?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
about
that?
i
know
you
don't
think
that
question's
here
because
there's
no
jurisdiction,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
no
different
--
the
question
isn't
here
because
he
still
has
five,
the
remnants
of
five
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
don't
know
--
we
don't
really
know
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
the
--
the
judicial
council
has
got
some
authority
to
enter
an
order
upon
--
upon
a
dispute,
but
what
it
knows,
as
well
as
anybody
else
knows,
when
the
judge
has
tried
these
cases
or
has
only
one
or
two
left,
is
it
--
is
it
empowered
to
leave
its
order
in
effect
or
should
it
change
it?
is
it
qualified
to
just
sit
there
and
say
well,
if
the
judges
want
to
--
to
leave
this
order
in
effect,
that
they
may?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
the
judicial
said,
“well,
we'll
just
leave
our
order
in
effect,”
even
though
this
means
that
judge
chandler
never
gets
another
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
original
order
of
the
council
then,
you
would
think
there
was
some
question
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
weren't
--
there
wasn't
any
expiration
date
on
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
do
you
think
the
judicial
council
should
do
when
judge
chandler
is
out
of
business,
and
his
old
cases
or
so
called
statute
that
to
say
he
has
all
business
is
rather
a
(inaudible).
do
you
think
the
judicial
council
is
entitled
to
leave
its
order
in
effect
just
because
the
district
judges
say
it's
satisfactory
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
two
--
three
district
judges,
as
long
as
they
all
agree,
can
agree
that
one
judge
will
never
have
any
more
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
just
said.
i
just
said,
can
all
of
the
judges
of
a
district
agree
that
one
judge
will
never
be
able
to
--
will
never
do
any
more
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
answer
is
essential
to
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
that
a
judicial
function,
the
removal
of
an
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
is
removal,
why
is
that
a
judicial
function
necessarily?
i
suppose
the
president
has
the
power
to
remove
from
office
various
members
of
the
executive
branch?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
and
when
he
does
that,
he's
performing
a
judicial
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
when
a
judge,
a
district
judge
removes
a
--
removes
a
probation
officer,
he's
exercising
a
judicial
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
backed
up
by
an
order
of
the
judicial
council
because
the
time
he
agreed
to
that,
he
disagreed
with
the
reassignment
of
cases
that
he
already
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judicial
council
then
entered
an
order,
didn't
it,
saying
that
he
can
keep
his
old
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
he
can't
have
any
new
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
order
still
outstanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
judge
chandler
said,
“i
want
to
be
assigned
my
full
quota
of
the
cases”
and
the
other
two
judges
disagreed
and
said
the
present
division
should
continue,
then
there
would
be
a
disagreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
assume
then
that
the
council,
the
judicial
council
entered
an
order,
saying
no
new
cases.
would
you
say
that
was
beyond
their
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
same
grounds
that
you're
using
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
purported
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you
--
i
don't
know
why
you
think
the

you

you

that
section
137
did
not

the
judicial

did
in
this

by
saying
no
to

justice
byron

you

the

i

justice
byron

white
alright,
assume
that
it
does.
is
it
constitutional
or
the

the
two
district
judges
say
who
declared,
“we

then,
it
goes
to
the

and
the
council
says,
“well,
you
can't
have
any

cases.
we'll
bring
you
to
a
new
case.”
now,
assuming
137
authorizes
that,
you
nevertheless
say
its
constitutional?
justice
byron

i

i

but
what
about

the

so
there's
a

and
the

and
the

then
says,
“we

i
