justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
we
come
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
what
is
the
exact
situation
of
judge
chandler
now?
is
he
being
assigned
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
wright?
assuming
that
on
the
time
about
judge
chandler,
chandler
runs
out
of
business
because
he
sensed
that
there
is
a
disagreement
among
the
district
judges
as
to
whether
any
more
cases
should
be
assigned
him.
is
there
anything
to
show
in
this
record
that
the
circuit
council
would
not
step
in
and
break
that
lock?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
disagreements
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general
you're
in
disagreement
on
the
basic
question
as
to
whether
there's
a
judicial
function,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right,
and
therefore
from
your
point
of
view,
that
one
in
your
position
is
acceptable
that
would
--
you'd
never
get
the
questions
and
still
be
all
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
other
hand,
i
understand
you're
in
agreement
with
some
of
the
topics
in
doubt
that
if
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
accepted
on
the
basic
question
as
to
whether
this
is
administrative
or
judicial
function
you
are
in
some
doubt
that
you
have
been
sharing
his
view
that
you
always
act
would
reach
it.
