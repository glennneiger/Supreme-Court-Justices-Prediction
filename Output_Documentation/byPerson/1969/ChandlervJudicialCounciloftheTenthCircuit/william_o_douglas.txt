justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
council
undertake
to
say
that
certain
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
shall
not
sit
in
certain
cases?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
running
just
to
the
--
i
know
that
judge
chandler
is
a
district
judge.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
asking
as
a
matter
of
practice
what
is
it
that
the
tenth
circuit
done
with
respect
to
circuit
judges?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know,
but
what
have
they
done
as
respect
to
the
circuit?
this
is
pretty
wide-roving
power,
it
seems
to
me.
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
--
an
agency
can
produce
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
suppose
that
there'd
be
no
case
or
controversy
more
vital
in
the
life
of
a
district
judge
in
a
proceeding
to
--
against
him
to
toss
him
out
of
office.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
used
--
i
read
your
brief
differently.
perhaps
i
read
it
too
fast,
but
you
now
say
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
but
it's
in
the
wrong
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
just
using
it
--
in
the
article
iii
sense
of
the
constitution.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that.
