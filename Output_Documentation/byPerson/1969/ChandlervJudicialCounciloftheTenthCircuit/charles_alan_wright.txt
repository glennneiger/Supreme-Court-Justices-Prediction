mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please
in
my
submission,
the
part
of
this
case
was
in
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
mr.
kenan
when
he
said,
“would
you
agree
that
if
the
action
of
the
judicial
council
was
administrative
in
nature
that
this
court
is
entirely
without
jurisdiction
to
review
the
matter?”
and
mr.
kenan
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative,
an
answer
that
i
think
is
compelled
by
a
line
of
authority
going
back
to
marbury
v.
madison,
that
unless
the
proceeding
that
is
brought
here
is
a
judicial
action
by
an
inferior
tribunal,
but
then
this
court
is
being
asked
to
exercise
original
jurisdiction
and
that
it
may
do
only
in
cases
to
which
states
were
parties
or
ambassadors
or
consuls
are
involved.
mr.
kenan
having
agreed
with
the
basic
premise
then
suggested
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
judicial
council
acted
in
a
judicial
fashion,
an
argument
that
i
must
confess
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following.
his
view
as
i
understand
it
is
that
congress
intended
to
create
an
administrative
agency
called
the
judicial
council.
i
agree
entirely.
it
seems
that
legislative
history
is
clear,
that
literature
is
all
in
one
direction
on
this
that
no
one,
so
far
as
prior
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case,
has
ever
suggested
that
a
judicial
council
is
vested
with
any
part
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
that
it
has
always
been
understood
to
be
merely
an
administrative
agency.
justices
black
and
douglas
when
this
case
was
here
before
referred
to
it
as
a
governmental
agency
with
limited
administrative
power.
now,
i
agree
entirely
with
this
characterization
of
the
judicial
council.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it
would
--
it
would
not
be
a
case
or
controversy
subject
to
review
in
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
administrative
agencies
are
subject
for
review
under
special
statutory
provisions
or
non-statutory
review
under
1361
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
my
view,
an
action
would
lie
in
the
district
court
under
section
1361,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
the
term
case
or
controversy
may
be
used
in
two
different
sentences.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
undoubtedly,
the
proceeding
between
judge
chandler
and
the
judicial
council,
what
we
are
arguing
this
morning
is
a
case
or
controversy,
though
i
submit
that
it
is
a
case
or
controversy
that
this
court
can't
hear
because
it's
not
within
your
original
jurisdiction.
in
my
submission,
what
the
judicial
council
did,
whether
the
relevant
order
be
that
of
december
13,
1965
or
as
i
think
february
4,
1966
was
not
a
case
or
controversy,
that
it
bore
none
of
the
earmarks
of
a
judicial
determination,
that
as
you've
suggested,
mr.
justice
douglas,
an
administrative
action
may
lead
to
a
case
or
controversy.
someone
may
be
dissatisfied
with
what
an
administrator
has
done,
and
then
challenge
that.
but
the
appropriate
place
to
challenge
that
is
not
in
the
first
instance,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
the
judicial
council
has
power
over
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
question
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
not
relying
on
any
inherent
power,
justice
black.
the
judicial
council
in
my
view
has
the
powers
that
congress
has
given
it
by
statute
and
none
other.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me
that
his
remedy,
if
any,
would
be
in
the
district
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
my
submission,
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
it
would
have
two
remedies,
justice
black.
he
could
either
go
to
the
district
court
or
he
--
if
he
believed
the
order
were
improper
to
refuse
to
obey
it
and
the
matter
would
then
have
to
be
tried
by
the
senate
sitting
as
the
court
of
impeachment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
that
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
respectfully
disagree,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
court
in
booth
versus
united
states
suggested
that
taking
away
the
right
to
try
cases
is
not
removal
so
long
as
the
office
and
the
salary
continue
that
the
--
the
taking
away
of
the
right
to
try
cases
is
not
barred
by
the
constitution,
it
is
dictum
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
was
dictum
by
justice
roberts
in
291
u.s,
but
the
position
that
we've
take
of
course
is
that
this
court
has
no
occasion
in
this
proceeding
to
decide
whether
impeachment
is,
as
some
people
believe
or
as
not
as
others
believe,
the
only
way
that
action
can
be
taken
against
a
federal
judge.
we
think
that
first,
you
lack
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
altogether,
that
the
petitioner
has
misconceived
the
proper
forum
in
which
to
seek
a
remedy.
and
second,
we
believe
that
if
this
court
had
jurisdiction
but
on
the
merits
it
could
not
now
reach
the
court
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
order
of
december
13th
was
an
attempt
to
remove
judge
chandler,
whether
it
was
a
proper
order
that
this
court
does
not
issue
advisory
opinions
about
things
that
have
long
since
gone
out
of
existence.
that
the
order
is
now
in
effect
to
those
of
february
4,
1966
and
september,
1967
in
which
the
judicial
council
has
provided
that
judge
chandler
may
hear
the
cases
that
judge
chandler
certified
that
he
wanted
to
hear.
under
the
order
of
the
judicial
council,
anytime
the
judges
of
the
western
district
agree
on
a
new
division,
that
will
go
into
effect
immediately.
if
they
disagree,
they
have
only
to
disagree
and
evoke
the
statutory
power
of
the
judicial
council
and
it
then
resolves
the
disagreement.
the
one
time
there
was
a
disagreement,
it
resolved
to
disagreement
in
the
direction
that
judge
chandler
had
asked
for
rather
then
the
direction
the
other
judges
had
asked
for.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
that
it
is
clearly
within
the
statutory
power
granted
to
the
judicial
council.
a
question
could
then
arise
whether
that
particular
form
of
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
judicial
council
is
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
don't
think
that
question
is
here
because
that's
not
this
order,
justice
white.
that
is
a
hypothetical
case
that
i've
--
i
think
it
would
be
amidst
the
difficulty.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
if
he
wants
more
cases,
he
has
only
to
(voice
overlap),
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
--
no,
we
don't
know
it.
we
don't
know
it
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
that
the
judicial
council
has
shown
no
inclination
to
do
--
to
take
--
to
further
course
of
conduct,
justice
white
that
you
suggest.
the
judicial
council
on
its
own
initiative,
noting
that
judge
chandler
had
at
that
time
only
12
cases
left,
suggested
to
the
judges
in
the
western
district
that
they
make
a
new
division
and
the
judges
reported
back
and
said,
“no,
the
current
division
is
agreeable
to
us.”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
leave
the
order
in
effect
until
the
judges
decide
that
they
--
that
they
want
to
change
the
division
of
business.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
no
doubt,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
present
orders
of
the
council
are
justified
by
the
constitution
that
they
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
are
justified
by
the
constitution
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
given
its
overtly
interlocutory
nature,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
have
serious
doubt
if
the
council
had
purported
to
say,
“judge
x,
you
may
never
again
hear
a
case,”
but
when
the
council,
as
it
represented
to
the
court
through
its
--
through
the
solicitor
general
said
that
this
was
intended
only
to
be
an
interlocutory
until
we
could
give
a
proper
hearing
to
the
matter,
i
think
that
that
temporary
power
may
constitutionally
be
exercised.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
would
think
that
if
that
had
purported
to
be
a
permanent
order,
there
would
be
the
gravest
question
about
it
on
procedural
grounds
alone
without
even
reaching
the
substance.
i
would
have
great
difficulty
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
said
until
further
order,
and
the
council
then
represented
to
this
court
that
it
intended
to
dispose
of
the
matter
promptly
and
i
believe
that
we
have
to
accept
what
the
council
has
said
at
its
face
value.
i
think
there
are
even
some
circumstances
in
which
constitutionally,
a
judicial
council
or
someone
other
than
the
senate
may
tell
a
judge
that
he
is
not
to
hear
any
cases
at
all
in
the
future.
i
think
that
when
there
is
a
certification
under
section
372
(b)
and
a
new
judge
is
appointed,
the
judge
who
is
found
to
be
physically
and
mentally
disabled
under
the
statute
becomes
junior
in
seniority,
but
it
would
be
unbelievable
that
a
judge
who
has
been
found
mentally
disabled
to
act
as
a
judge
then
be
free
to
hear
cases,
and
i
can't
conceive
that
that
is
what
the
statute
contemplates
or
that
is
the
practice,
or
that
is
what
the
constitution
would
require
under
those
circumstances.
but
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
right.
the
title
judge
cannot
be
taken
away.
his
compensation
cannot
be
taken
away.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
our
constitution
means
a
great
deal
more
than
that
about
the
independence
of
judges,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
the
judicial
independence
is
a
--
is
a
quality
that
goes
far
beyond
the
very
limited
issues
that
are
here
at
stake.
i
think
judicial
independence
means
nobody
is
to
tell
a
judge
how
he's
to
decide
a
case,
that
he's
not
to
be
answerable
except
to
an
appellate
court
for
his
views
of
the
law.
judicial
independence
means
this
and
much
else,
but
i
do
not
think
that
judicial
independence
means
that
a
person
who
has
been
found
by
a
judicial
council
and
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
mentally
unable
to
function
as
a
judge
be
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
function
as
a
judge.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
saying
exactly
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
precisely
what
the
statute
provides
and
again,
the
constitution
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
this
statute
i
have
to
say
has
no
relevance
to
this
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
believe
that
the
constitution
left
it
to
the
congress
to
create
procedures
for
these
exigencies
that
the
congress
did
sol
many
years
ago,
and
this
court,
again
by
way
of
dictum
in
booth
expressly
spoke
of
that
procedure
as
being
a
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
was
by
way
of
dictum,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
not
decided.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
statute
was
not
involved
in
this
case
nor
with
respect
in
our
view
are
many
of
the
matters
that
we
have
been
discussing
here
at
oral
argument.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
an
order
resolving
a
disagreement
among
the
district
judges
as
to
how
that
this
should
be
divided.
and
in
my
view,
it
does
not
help
us
to
speak
hypothetically
of
what
the
sit
--
the
situation
might
be
if
some
judge
were
to
be
told
that
he
may
not
hear
any
cases.
that
is
not
here,
we
have
no
judge
who
is
in
that
position
and
i
cannot
think
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
imagine
unlikely
hypothetical
cases
that
may
arise
in
the
future
and
to
pronounce
judgment
upon
them
before
they
come
up.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
case
is
here,
but
the
case
of
a
judge
who
is
--
who
is
not
allowed
to
hear
any
case
is
not
before
us
at
this
time.
judge
chandler
has
cases
pending
on
his
docket.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
litigants
whose
cases
are
pending
before
judge
chandler
will
have
their
cases
tried
by
judge
chandler.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
twice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
twice,
on
january
25,
1966
and
again
on
september
1967.
now,
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
fairness
to
judge
chandler,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
must
be
said
that
on
the
january
25th
agreement,
he
noted
that
it
was
done
under
protest
and
that
he
did
not
want
to
waive
any
of
this
rights
to
challenge
the
then
still
existing
order
of
december
13th.
the
september
1967
agreement
said
the
present
division
is
agreeable
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
council
would
not
step
in.
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
council
would
not
give
judge
chandler
whatever
division
he
thought
equitable.
it
would
be
pure
speculation
to
suppose
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
difficult,
justice
black,
to
understand
how
the
fact
that
they
met
without
any
precedent
on
december
13th
says
anything
as
to
what
they
will
do
in
the
future,
in
the
particular
hypothesis
put
to
me
by
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
that
--
that
would
be
precise
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
obviously
some
of
you
do,
justice
black.
i
could
only
respectfully
disagree.
the
jurisdictional
question
seems
to
me
from
the
greatest
importance,
and
this
i
think
is
a
little
different,
justice
black,
from
the
matter
that
you
and
i
just
disagreed
on.
you
think
that
the
december
13th
order
is
before
us
--
before
you.
i
would
disagree
on
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
you
think
that
the
order
of
december
13,
1965
is
properly
here.
as
counsel,
i
disagree
but
there
is
a
different
question,
and
that
is
whether
anything
is
properly
here,
even
if
the
december
13th
order
was
still
in
full
force
and
effect,
and
it's
an
order
of
the
constitutionality
of
which
i
think
i
can
safely
predict
your
view
on
at
least
that
would
not
--
that
would
not
create
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
original
jurisdiction
does
not
arise
out
of
necessity.
it
does
not
arise
because
something
has
happened
that
may
be
gravely
unconstitutional.
original
jurisdiction
is
carefully
defined
by
the
constitution
and
the
--
the
best
known
case
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
so
that
you
simply
can't
go
beyond
them.
the
doctrine
in
drawing
the
line
between
original
and
appellate
jurisdiction
has
been
laid
down
many
times.
it
bears
such
famous
names
as
marshall
story,
tony
brandeis,
and
that
is
that
this
court
can
act
only
if
an
inferior
tribunal
has
acted
judicially,
and
i
submit
that
whatever
the
judicial
council
did,
right
or
wrong,
the
judicial
council
is
not
a
court
and
what
its
action
is
it's
not
judicial.
it
was
administrative
action.
it
may
have
been,
as
my
friends
on
this
side
of
the
table
think
and
its
someone
outside
of
the
bench
think
a
very
terrible
thing
that
the
council
did.
but
administrative
agencies
on
occasion
did
do
terrible
things,
and
that
fact
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
create
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
nor
does
it
permit
this
court
to
act
immediately
on
the
theory
that
it
might
come
here
sometime
and
therefore,
it's
potentially
within
our
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
--
its
potential
appellate
jurisdiction
does
not
begin
to
exist
until
the
case
has
reached
some
judicial
tribunal
of
the
united
states.
now,
i'm
aware
of
course
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
hirota
v.
macarthur
suggesting
a
somewhat
different
view
on
that
and
with
respect,
i
disagree.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
marbury
v.
madison,
united
states
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
v.
ferreira,
tuten
v.
united
states
--
yes,
i
think
that
they
passed
on
exactly
that
i
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
uh-huh.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
it
--
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
--
an
attempt
to
invoke
a
regional
jurisdiction
or
appellate
jurisdiction,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
exactly
right,
justice
harlan.
and
then,
when
we
go
beyond
that,
i'm
in
agreement
entirely
with
the
solicitor
general
--
(voice
overlap)
on
everything
going
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please
in
my
submission,
the
part
of
this
case
was
in
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
mr.
kenan
when
he
said,
“would
you
agree
that
if
the
action
of
the
judicial
council
was
administrative
in
nature
that
this
court
is
entirely
without
jurisdiction
to
review
the
matter?”
and
mr.
kenan
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative,
an
answer
that
i
think
is
compelled
by
a
line
of
authority
going
back
to
marbury
v.
madison,
that
unless
the
proceeding
that
is
brought
here
is
a
judicial
action
by
an
inferior
tribunal,
but
then
this
court
is
being
asked
to
exercise
original
jurisdiction
and
that
it
may
do
only
in
cases
to
which
states
were
parties
or
ambassadors
or
consuls
are
involved.
mr.
kenan
having
agreed
with
the
basic
premise
then
suggested
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
judicial
council
acted
in
a
judicial
fashion,
an
argument
that
i
must
confess
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following.
his
view
as
i
understand
it
is
that
congress
intended
to
create
an
administrative
agency
called
the
judicial
council.
i
agree
entirely.
it
seems
that
legislative
history
is
clear,
that
literature
is
all
in
one
direction
on
this
that
no
one,
so
far
as
prior
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case,
has
ever
suggested
that
a
judicial
council
is
vested
with
any
part
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
that
it
has
always
been
understood
to
be
merely
an
administrative
agency.
justices
black
and
douglas
when
this
case
was
here
before
referred
to
it
as
a
governmental
agency
with
limited
administrative
power.
now,
i
agree
entirely
with
this
characterization
of
the
judicial
council.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it
would
--
it
would
not
be
a
case
or
controversy
subject
to
review
in
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
administrative
agencies
are
subject
for
review
under
special
statutory
provisions
or
non-statutory
review
under
1361
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
my
view,
an
action
would
lie
in
the
district
court
under
section
1361,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
the
term
case
or
controversy
may
be
used
in
two
different
sentences.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
undoubtedly,
the
proceeding
between
judge
chandler
and
the
judicial
council,
what
we
are
arguing
this
morning
is
a
case
or
controversy,
though
i
submit
that
it
is
a
case
or
controversy
that
this
court
can't
hear
because
it's
not
within
your
original
jurisdiction.
in
my
submission,
what
the
judicial
council
did,
whether
the
relevant
order
be
that
of
december
13,
1965
or
as
i
think
february
4,
1966
was
not
a
case
or
controversy,
that
it
bore
none
of
the
earmarks
of
a
judicial
determination,
that
as
you've
suggested,
mr.
justice
douglas,
an
administrative
action
may
lead
to
a
case
or
controversy.
someone
may
be
dissatisfied
with
what
an
administrator
has
done,
and
then
challenge
that.
but
the
appropriate
place
to
challenge
that
is
not
in
the
first
instance,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
the
judicial
council
has
power
over
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
question
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
not
relying
on
any
inherent
power,
justice
black.
the
judicial
council
in
my
view
has
the
powers
that
congress
has
given
it
by
statute
and
none
other.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
seems
to
me
that
his
remedy,
if
any,
would
be
in
the
district
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
precisely
my
submission,
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
it
would
have
two
remedies,
justice
black.
he
could
either
go
to
the
district
court
or
he
--
if
he
believed
the
order
were
improper
to
refuse
to
obey
it
and
the
matter
would
then
have
to
be
tried
by
the
senate
sitting
as
the
court
of
impeachment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
that
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
respectfully
disagree,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
court
in
booth
versus
united
states
suggested
that
taking
away
the
right
to
try
cases
is
not
removal
so
long
as
the
office
and
the
salary
continue
that
the
--
the
taking
away
of
the
right
to
try
cases
is
not
barred
by
the
constitution,
it
is
dictum
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
it
was
dictum
by
justice
roberts
in
291
u.s,
but
the
position
that
we've
take
of
course
is
that
this
court
has
no
occasion
in
this
proceeding
to
decide
whether
impeachment
is,
as
some
people
believe
or
as
not
as
others
believe,
the
only
way
that
action
can
be
taken
against
a
federal
judge.
we
think
that
first,
you
lack
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
altogether,
that
the
petitioner
has
misconceived
the
proper
forum
in
which
to
seek
a
remedy.
and
second,
we
believe
that
if
this
court
had
jurisdiction
but
on
the
merits
it
could
not
now
reach
the
court
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
order
of
december
13th
was
an
attempt
to
remove
judge
chandler,
whether
it
was
a
proper
order
that
this
court
does
not
issue
advisory
opinions
about
things
that
have
long
since
gone
out
of
existence.
that
the
order
is
now
in
effect
to
those
of
february
4,
1966
and
september,
1967
in
which
the
judicial
council
has
provided
that
judge
chandler
may
hear
the
cases
that
judge
chandler
certified
that
he
wanted
to
hear.
under
the
order
of
the
judicial
council,
anytime
the
judges
of
the
western
district
agree
on
a
new
division,
that
will
go
into
effect
immediately.
if
they
disagree,
they
have
only
to
disagree
and
evoke
the
statutory
power
of
the
judicial
council
and
it
then
resolves
the
disagreement.
the
one
time
there
was
a
disagreement,
it
resolved
to
disagreement
in
the
direction
that
judge
chandler
had
asked
for
rather
then
the
direction
the
other
judges
had
asked
for.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
that
it
is
clearly
within
the
statutory
power
granted
to
the
judicial
council.
a
question
could
then
arise
whether
that
particular
form
of
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
judicial
council
is
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
don't
think
that
question
is
here
because
that's
not
this
order,
justice
white.
that
is
a
hypothetical
case
that
i've
--
i
think
it
would
be
amidst
the
difficulty.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
and
if
he
wants
more
cases,
he
has
only
to
(voice
overlap),
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
--
no,
we
don't
know
it.
we
don't
know
it
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
suggest
that
the
judicial
council
has
shown
no
inclination
to
do
--
to
take
--
to
further
course
of
conduct,
justice
white
that
you
suggest.
the
judicial
council
on
its
own
initiative,
noting
that
judge
chandler
had
at
that
time
only
12
cases
left,
suggested
to
the
judges
in
the
western
district
that
they
make
a
new
division
and
the
judges
reported
back
and
said,
“no,
the
current
division
is
agreeable
to
us.”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
they
leave
the
order
in
effect
until
the
judges
decide
that
they
--
that
they
want
to
change
the
division
of
business.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
have
no
doubt,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
present
orders
of
the
council
are
justified
by
the
constitution
that
they
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
are
justified
by
the
constitution
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
given
its
overtly
interlocutory
nature,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
have
serious
doubt
if
the
council
had
purported
to
say,
“judge
x,
you
may
never
again
hear
a
case,”
but
when
the
council,
as
it
represented
to
the
court
through
its
--
through
the
solicitor
general
said
that
this
was
intended
only
to
be
an
interlocutory
until
we
could
give
a
proper
hearing
to
the
matter,
i
think
that
that
temporary
power
may
constitutionally
be
exercised.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i
would
think
that
if
that
had
purported
to
be
a
permanent
order,
there
would
be
the
gravest
question
about
it
on
procedural
grounds
alone
without
even
reaching
the
substance.
i
would
have
great
difficulty
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
said
until
further
order,
and
the
council
then
represented
to
this
court
that
it
intended
to
dispose
of
the
matter
promptly
and
i
believe
that
we
have
to
accept
what
the
council
has
said
at
its
face
value.
i
think
there
are
even
some
circumstances
in
which
constitutionally,
a
judicial
council
or
someone
other
than
the
senate
may
tell
a
judge
that
he
is
not
to
hear
any
cases
at
all
in
the
future.
i
think
that
when
there
is
a
certification
under
section
372
(b)
and
a
new
judge
is
appointed,
the
judge
who
is
found
to
be
physically
and
mentally
disabled
under
the
statute
becomes
junior
in
seniority,
but
it
would
be
unbelievable
that
a
judge
who
has
been
found
mentally
disabled
to
act
as
a
judge
then
be
free
to
hear
cases,
and
i
can't
conceive
that
that
is
what
the
statute
contemplates
or
that
is
the
practice,
or
that
is
what
the
constitution
would
require
under
those
circumstances.
but
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
right.
the
title
judge
cannot
be
taken
away.
his
compensation
cannot
be
taken
away.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
our
constitution
means
a
great
deal
more
than
that
about
the
independence
of
judges,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
the
judicial
independence
is
a
--
is
a
quality
that
goes
far
beyond
the
very
limited
issues
that
are
here
at
stake.
i
think
judicial
independence
means
nobody
is
to
tell
a
judge
how
he's
to
decide
a
case,
that
he's
not
to
be
answerable
except
to
an
appellate
court
for
his
views
of
the
law.
judicial
independence
means
this
and
much
else,
but
i
do
not
think
that
judicial
independence
means
that
a
person
who
has
been
found
by
a
judicial
council
and
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
mentally
unable
to
function
as
a
judge
be
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
function
as
a
judge.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
saying
exactly
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it's
precisely
what
the
statute
provides
and
again,
the
constitution
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
this
statute
i
have
to
say
has
no
relevance
to
this
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
believe
that
the
constitution
left
it
to
the
congress
to
create
procedures
for
these
exigencies
that
the
congress
did
sol
many
years
ago,
and
this
court,
again
by
way
of
dictum
in
booth
expressly
spoke
of
that
procedure
as
being
a
constitutional.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
was
by
way
of
dictum,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
not
decided.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
statute
was
not
involved
in
this
case
nor
with
respect
in
our
view
are
many
of
the
matters
that
we
have
been
discussing
here
at
oral
argument.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
an
order
resolving
a
disagreement
among
the
district
judges
as
to
how
that
this
should
be
divided.
and
in
my
view,
it
does
not
help
us
to
speak
hypothetically
of
what
the
sit
--
the
situation
might
be
if
some
judge
were
to
be
told
that
he
may
not
hear
any
cases.
that
is
not
here,
we
have
no
judge
who
is
in
that
position
and
i
cannot
think
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
imagine
unlikely
hypothetical
cases
that
may
arise
in
the
future
and
to
pronounce
judgment
upon
them
before
they
come
up.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
case
is
here,
but
the
case
of
a
judge
who
is
--
who
is
not
allowed
to
hear
any
case
is
not
before
us
at
this
time.
judge
chandler
has
cases
pending
on
his
docket.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
litigants
whose
cases
are
pending
before
judge
chandler
will
have
their
cases
tried
by
judge
chandler.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
twice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
twice,
on
january
25,
1966
and
again
on
september
1967.
now,
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
fairness
to
judge
chandler,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
must
be
said
that
on
the
january
25th
agreement,
he
noted
that
it
was
done
under
protest
and
that
he
did
not
want
to
waive
any
of
this
rights
to
challenge
the
then
still
existing
order
of
december
13th.
the
september
1967
agreement
said
the
present
division
is
agreeable
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
council
would
not
step
in.
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
council
would
not
give
judge
chandler
whatever
division
he
thought
equitable.
it
would
be
pure
speculation
to
suppose
anything
to
the
contrary.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
find
it
difficult,
justice
black,
to
understand
how
the
fact
that
they
met
without
any
precedent
on
december
13th
says
anything
as
to
what
they
will
do
in
the
future,
in
the
particular
hypothesis
put
to
me
by
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
that
--
that
would
be
precise
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
obviously
some
of
you
do,
justice
black.
i
could
only
respectfully
disagree.
the
jurisdictional
question
seems
to
me
from
the
greatest
importance,
and
this
i
think
is
a
little
different,
justice
black,
from
the
matter
that
you
and
i
just
disagreed
on.
you
think
that
the
december
13th
order
is
before
us
--
before
you.
i
would
disagree
on
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
you
think
that
the
order
of
december
13,
1965
is
properly
here.
as
counsel,
i
disagree
but
there
is
a
different
question,
and
that
is
whether
anything
is
properly
here,
even
if
the
december
13th
order
was
still
in
full
force
and
effect,
and
it's
an
order
of
the
constitutionality
of
which
i
think
i
can
safely
predict
your
view
on
at
least
that
would
not
--
that
would
not
create
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
original
jurisdiction
does
not
arise
out
of
necessity.
it
does
not
arise
because
something
has
happened
that
may
be
gravely
unconstitutional.
original
jurisdiction
is
carefully
defined
by
the
constitution
and
the
--
the
best
known
case
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
so
that
you
simply
can't
go
beyond
them.
the
doctrine
in
drawing
the
line
between
original
and
appellate
jurisdiction
has
been
laid
down
many
times.
it
bears
such
famous
names
as
marshall
story,
tony
brandeis,
and
that
is
that
this
court
can
act
only
if
an
inferior
tribunal
has
acted
judicially,
and
i
submit
that
whatever
the
judicial
council
did,
right
or
wrong,
the
judicial
council
is
not
a
court
and
what
its
action
is
it's
not
judicial.
it
was
administrative
action.
it
may
have
been,
as
my
friends
on
this
side
of
the
table
think
and
its
someone
outside
of
the
bench
think
a
very
terrible
thing
that
the
council
did.
but
administrative
agencies
on
occasion
did
do
terrible
things,
and
that
fact
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
create
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
nor
does
it
permit
this
court
to
act
immediately
on
the
theory
that
it
might
come
here
sometime
and
therefore,
it's
potentially
within
our
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
--
its
potential
appellate
jurisdiction
does
not
begin
to
exist
until
the
case
has
reached
some
judicial
tribunal
of
the
united
states.
now,
i'm
aware
of
course
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
hirota
v.
macarthur
suggesting
a
somewhat
different
view
on
that
and
with
respect,
i
disagree.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
marbury
v.
madison,
united
states
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
v.
ferreira,
tuten
v.
united
states
--
yes,
i
think
that
they
passed
on
exactly
that
i
think
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
uh-huh.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
it
--
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
--
an
attempt
to
invoke
a
regional
jurisdiction
or
appellate
jurisdiction,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
exactly.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
exactly
right,
justice
harlan.
and
then,
when
we
go
beyond
that,
i'm
in
agreement
entirely
with
the
solicitor
general
--
(voice
overlap)
on
everything
going
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you.
