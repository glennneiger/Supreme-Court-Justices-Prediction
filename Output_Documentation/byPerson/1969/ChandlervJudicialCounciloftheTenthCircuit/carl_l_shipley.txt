mr.
carl
l.
shipley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
lineup
in
which
presentations
will
be
made
in
our
time
situation,
i
would
like
to
anticipate
some
of
the
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
has
included
in
his
brief
and
some
of
the
arguments
which
are
presented
by
professor
wright
in
his
brief
in
this
case.
i
think
that
in
considering
the
matter,
the
court
necessarily
must
bear
in
mind
the
long
history
involving
good
behavior
and
the
impeachment
sections
of
the
federal
constitution
and
major
section
332
of
the
statute
and
the
action
of
the
judicial
council
in
this
specific
case
against
that
long
history.
a
part
of
these
two
briefs
to
which
i
refer
address
themselves
to
that
problem,
to
the
history
and
we
all
know
that
from
the
time
that
john
randolph
in
1787
made
his
original
resolutions
respecting
a
national
judiciary
in
the
continental
congress.
and
when
mr.
dickinson
moved
that
the
good
behavior
provision
should
be
modified
to
follow
the
british
pattern
that
where
a
--
and
address
by
the
congress
and
the
senate
to
the
president
might
result
in
the
removal
of
a
federal
judge,
that
this
was
rejected
in
favor
of
the
independence
of
the
federal
judiciary.
we'd
recall
that
thomas
jefferson
of
course
strongly
supported
the
idea
of
total
independence,
except
for
impeachment
and
then,
a
few
years
later,
we
find
that
he
was
criticizing
the
impeachment
procedures
as
not
being
adequate.
and
against
that
background,
we
have
to
look
at
what's
happened
in
this
specific
case.
it
can
only
be
characterized
as
outrageous.
there
is
a
chief
judge
at
federal
district
court
who
served
with
honor,
with
honesty,
with
efficiency
for
26
years,
who's
been
chief
judge
for
8
years.
we
know
from
public
documents
that
are
a
matter
of
public
record
in
which
in
our
brief,
we've
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
and
which
it
properly
can
take
judicial
notice
of
--
and
which
it
should
take
judicial
notice
of
that
there's
been
a
long
friction
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
between
what
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
thought
it
could
do
honestly,
i
suppose,
in
terms
of
section
332
and
section
137,
section
372,
perhaps
section
371
of
title
28.
and
this
--
a
friction
has
manifested
itself
ultimately
in
the
final
order
of
the
judicial
council
which
was
not
its
first
order
against
this
judge.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
there
are
references
to
the
occidental
petroleum
case
and
to
the
texaco
case
that
referred
to
the
judicial
council's
order,
not
by
name,
but
simply
saying
that
the
judge
has
been
involved
in
criminal
and
civil
litigation
which
has
had
some
impact
that
speak
of
his
attitude
and
his
conduct
and
the
efficiency
of
the
court
without
any
factual
showing
as
to
how
these
relate
in
any
manner
to
the
difficulties
any
federal
judge
has
over
many
years
in
dealing
with
complicated
cases
and
complicated
litigants.
the
first
question
which
concerns
me
against
this
historical
background
is
the
--
the
threshold
question,
as
the
solicitor
general
calls
it,
of
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
which
some
of
the
justices
have
raised.
our
position
is
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1651
of
title
28,
that
being
the
all
writs
act,
which
incorporates
as
we
understand
it
and
as
we
understand,
the
solicitor
general
understands
it.
it
incorporates
the
old
sections
13
and
14
of
the
original
judiciary
act
of
1789.
and
although
judge
mcgruder
and
i
guess
the
josephson
case
perhaps
it
suggested
that
there
had
been
some
change
by
reason
of
the
revision
of
these
older
sections
into
the
present
section
1651,
the
all
writs
act.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
that
act.
a
second
point
i
think
i
would
touch
on
briefly
is
that
in
our
brief,
we
suggested
that
the
court
had
inherent
power.
and
we
also
mentioned
that
it
would
have
power
under
the
due
process
proceed
--
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
deal
with
the
matter
of
this
extraordinary
significance,
in
this
context,
in
this
historical
context,
and
in
--
and
then
the
practical
immediate
context
because
here,
these
are
live
judges
operating
a
very
important
circuit
of
where
we've
had
a
long
running
situation
that's
resulted
in
an
interference
by
somebody
with
the
operation
of
that
court.
our
position
is
the
tenth
judicial
council
has
unconstitutionally
not
impeached
the
judge
and
removed
the
judge
from
the
office,
but
they've
removed
the
office
from
the
judge
in
a
kind
of
reverse
english
procedure
which
certainly
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
because
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
our
judgment
on
the
face.
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
relating
to
this
matter
are
so
explicit
in
setting
up
a
special
court
in
the
senate
that
requires
a
two-thirds
vote
where
everybody's
on
oath
and
it
names
who
the
chief
justice
and
providing
officers
shall
be,
and
exactly
what
the
procedure
shall
be
in
the
judicial
proceeding
to
convict
somebody.
and
all
of
these
things
we
think
come
within
the
type
of
problem,
which
is
contemplated,
can
be
reached
under
section
1651
under
the
extraordinary
writs.
these
are
the
kind
of
extraordinary
circumstances,
the
actual
judicial
council
here
that
--
that
energize
and
bring
the
section
1651
into
play.
now,
the
inherent
powers,
we
didn't
just
make
up
the
term.
this
tenth
judicial
council
and
at
least
three
of
the
cases
cited
in
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
i
say
the
solicitor
general's
brief
does
not
touch
on
this.
it
makes
reference
to
the
fact
they
never
heard
of
this
court
suggesting
it
had
inherent
powers.
but
in
the
ritter
case
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
the
texaco
case
and
the
occidental
petroleum
case,
all
three,
the
court
there
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“we're
exercising
our
power
under
section
1651
or
our
inherent
appellate
jurisdiction.”
they
didn't
care
which,
and
they
specifically
stated
it
in
all
three
cases,
and
that's
how
they
acted
to
--
to
issue
extraordinary
writs
against
judge
chandler
in
these
specific
cases,
which
lie
at
the
base
of
the
existing
order
which
we
challenge.
now,
the
second
problem
that
seems
to
me
that
we're
concerned
with
is
the
solicitor
general,
and
putting
aside
professor
wright's
position,
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
we
follow
the
solicitor
general
on
that.
we
think
it
does,
for
the
reasons
he
addresses
himself
to
and
the
reasons
i
have
set
forth.
the
second
problem
is
whether
or
not,
and
as
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
he
says,
“either
the
case
is
moot
or
judge
chandler
is
estopped
from
being
here
because
he
has
agreed
to
the
present
division
of
business
in
his
court.”
on
the
question
of
agreement,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
this
was
a
kind
of
a
--
this
was
not
the
kind
of
a
--
of
an
agreement
that
can
lead
to
estoppel,
just
as
it
was
not
the
kind
of
disagreement
that
would
energize
section
137
of
title
28,
that
is
the
--
it
would
energize
or
activate
the
statutory
authority
whereby
the
tenth
judicial
council
could
divide
the
business
of
the
court.
and
on
that
point,
let
me
say
i
would
not
agree
that
an
exercise
of
section
137
so
extreme
that
it
deprived
the
judge
of
all
his
cases
was
a
constitutional
exercise
of
that
authority.
i
think
137
has
to
be
measured
against
what
they're
trying
to
do,
and
it
cannot
be
used
to
deprive
a
judge
of
his
office
any
more
than
section
332
can.
it
can
be
used
when
it's
activated
properly
by
a
genuine
and
bona
fide
disagreement
to
divide
the
business
of
the
court
so
we
can
get
on
with
the
judicial
business
of
the
nation.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
that
first
order,
the
order
we
challenge,
was
moot,
i
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
grant
case
we
cite
and
to
this
court's
more
recent
case
in
the
american
phosphate
exporters
case,
which
was
decided
last
november
which
addresses
itself
to
this
problem
of
mootness
and
i
just
have
a
--
just
a
word
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
the
court
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
i
think
the
court
simply
has
to
look
at
the
record
before
it.
this
matter
came
before
this
court
on
the
tenth
judicial
council's
original
order
of
december
13,
1965
where
they
said,
and
i
quote
directly
from
the
order,
“in
the
past
four
years,
the
judicial
council
at
many
meetings
has
discussed
and
considered
the
business
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
and
has
done
so
with
particular
regard
to
the
effect
thereon
of
the
attitude
and
conduct.”
so
these
are
not
words
in
any
statute.
they
made
them
up,
and
they
could
make
up
a
lot
more
and
any
judicial
council
could
at
this
court
authorize
this
kind
of
action.
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
judge
chandler,
who
as
chief
judge
of
the
district,
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
administration
of
such
business.
during
that
period,
judge
chandler
has
been
a
party
defendant
in
both
civil
and
criminal
litigation.
one
civil
case
is
still
pending
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
this
is
the
first
order
which
we
challenge
and
which
we
say
is
not
moot,
and
we
rely
on
the
american
export
case
which
points
out
that
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
takes
subsequent
curative
action
doesn't
remove
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
if
you'll
look
at
the
order
itself
under
section
332
of
the
original
order,
which
is
not
moot
when
you
look
at
the
cases,
and
which
simply
stated
in
terms
that
the
judge
was
literally,
his
office
was
taken
away
from
him
then
and
there,
and
his
cases
were
to
be
reassigned.
section
137
had
not
been
energized.
they
had
no
authority
under
section
137.
there
was
no
disagreement
as
to
the
assignment
of
the
work.
there's
no
showing
there
was
a
backlog.
there
was
no
showing
the
court
wasn't
operating
efficiently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statistics
from
the
office
--
the
administrative
office
showed
just
the
opposite.
he
was
doing
his
work
and
everybody
else
was
doing
theirs.
there
wasn't
the
slightest
question
of
the
efficiency
of
that
court.
the
question
was
just
what
they
said,
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
the
judge.
they
plainly
didn't
like
it.
there
was
no
objection
from
the
bar
association,
no
objection
from
litigants,
no
objection
from
the
lawyers
in
the
town,
no
objection
from
anybody,
except
the
tenth
judicial
council.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir.
they
would
have
no
such
authority
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
doubt
that
congress
would
have
the
authority
to
give
any
such
jurisdictional
authority
to
anybody.
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
overall
these
many
years
and
pending
bills
in
congress,
there'd
been
dozens
and
hundreds
of
them.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
only
the
tenth
circuit
says
it
has
it.
it
says
they
have
inherent
appellate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir.
i
think
the
united
states
itself
through
the
solicitor
general
has
weapons
available,
writ
of
quo
warranto.
it
could
follow
some
of
its
own
suggestions.
it
could
challenge
any
public
officer
who
wasn't
doing
his
duty
in
a
certain
way
but
it
--
i
think
the
constitution
sets
up
a
special
court
to
deal
with
judges
and
their
tenure
and
just
as
the
president
has
four
years,
a
judge
is
appointed
for
good
behavior.
and
when
that
question
of
good
behavior
is
to
be
resolved,
the
congress
itself
must
do
it
in
a
special
court
provided
in
the
constitution
with
a
two-thirds
vote
which
no
pardon
can
issue
under
the
constitution.
the
president
can't
pardon
the
person
and
he's
only
removed
from
his
office
and
if
there's
a
crime
or
something
else
involved,
then
he
can
be
subsequently
subjected
to
double
jeopardy,
let
us
say,
and
prosecuted
again.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
impeachment
would
merely
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir
and
the
record
of
impeachments
in
the
--
in
the
history
of
our
country
show
that
federal
judges
have
been
impeached
for
drunkenness
and
convicted.
they
have
been
impeached
for
corruption.
there
haven't
been
many
because
this
--
these
aren't
the
type
of
men
that
are
appointed
to
the
federal
judiciary,
but
the
weapon
is
there
and
can
be
used
and
the
procedures
are
very
adequate
to
serve
so
important
purpose.
may
i
ask
the
clerk
what
the
white
light
means?
am
i
out
of
time
or
am
i
within
some
minutes
of
being
out
of
time?
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
and
the
red
light,
i'll
be
out
of
time,
because
mr.
--
my
colleague
ran
over
so
badly
there,
i
don't
know
just
where
we
are.
i'll
continue
for
the
five
minutes.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
of
the
five
minutes?
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
we've
run
out
of
our
time
here
and
i
do
have
some
points
i
want
to
address
myself,
too,
and
i
want
to
know
when
the
time
was
up
for
our
side
in
the
matter.
if
the
court
please,
a
very
--
another
very
important
question
which
has
come
up
is
--
the
solicitor
general
i'm
sure
will
address
himself
to
is
whether
or
not
judge
chandler
has
agreed
to
the
present
division
of
business.
and
that
by
this
agreement,
he's
--
although
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
knew
that
he
use
the
term
that
he's
estopped,
whether
or
not
by
this
agreement,
it
makes
the
case
moot
or
removes
any
colors
for
this
court
to
get
into
what
the
solicitor
general
calls
the
delicate
question,
constitutional
questions
involved
in
section
332.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
judge
chandler's
agreement
was
not
a
bona
fide
agreement
in
the
sense
that
the
law
would
contemplate
it
that
it
should
be
to
a
estopping
from
complaining
about
something
to
which
he
had
agreed.
his
agreement
was
simply,
he
put
right
in
the
letter
that
he
was
signing
under
protest
to
avoid
creating
a
disagreement
and
that
he
would
expect
to
address
himself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
of
the
tenth
judicial
council,
as
outlined
in
our
brief.
i
see
that
my
time
has
come
out,
and
i'll
just
close
on
saying
this,
that
i
--
we
agree
with
congressman
celler
and
other
scholars
who
have
said
that
good
behavior,
attitude,
conduct
in
these
matters
are
not
just
issue.
they're
not
questions
that
can
be
tried
in
any
place
except
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
acting
as
a
court
of
impeachment
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
and
therefore,
we
would
say
this
court,
in
order
to
clarify
the
matter,
not
to
avoid
what's
the
delicate
problem
but
to
solve
what's
been
150
years
of
a
complicated
problem
should
speak
forthrightly
and
completely
and
totally
so
that
the
federal
judges
will
know,
the
judicial
councils
will
know
exactly
where
their
authority
begins
and
ends
under
section
137
and
under
section
332,
because
if
this
court
says
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
and
steps
away
from
this
case,
it
will
compound
what
is
a
very
serious
situation
which
will
continue
in
all
the
judicial
circuits.
some
of
them
may
run
wild.
we
don't
know
what
will
happen,
but
certainly,
these
are
human
beings
with
the
same
personality
frailties
that
have
given
rise
to
this
case
and
brought
all
of
us
here
today.
thank
you.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
lineup
in
which
presentations
will
be
made
in
our
time
situation,
i
would
like
to
anticipate
some
of
the
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
has
included
in
his
brief
and
some
of
the
arguments
which
are
presented
by
professor
wright
in
his
brief
in
this
case.
i
think
that
in
considering
the
matter,
the
court
necessarily
must
bear
in
mind
the
long
history
involving
good
behavior
and
the
impeachment
sections
of
the
federal
constitution
and
major
section
332
of
the
statute
and
the
action
of
the
judicial
council
in
this
specific
case
against
that
long
history.
a
part
of
these
two
briefs
to
which
i
refer
address
themselves
to
that
problem,
to
the
history
and
we
all
know
that
from
the
time
that
john
randolph
in
1787
made
his
original
resolutions
respecting
a
national
judiciary
in
the
continental
congress.
and
when
mr.
dickinson
moved
that
the
good
behavior
provision
should
be
modified
to
follow
the
british
pattern
that
where
a
--
and
address
by
the
congress
and
the
senate
to
the
president
might
result
in
the
removal
of
a
federal
judge,
that
this
was
rejected
in
favor
of
the
independence
of
the
federal
judiciary.
we'd
recall
that
thomas
jefferson
of
course
strongly
supported
the
idea
of
total
independence,
except
for
impeachment
and
then,
a
few
years
later,
we
find
that
he
was
criticizing
the
impeachment
procedures
as
not
being
adequate.
and
against
that
background,
we
have
to
look
at
what's
happened
in
this
specific
case.
it
can
only
be
characterized
as
outrageous.
there
is
a
chief
judge
at
federal
district
court
who
served
with
honor,
with
honesty,
with
efficiency
for
26
years,
who's
been
chief
judge
for
8
years.
we
know
from
public
documents
that
are
a
matter
of
public
record
in
which
in
our
brief,
we've
asked
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
and
which
it
properly
can
take
judicial
notice
of
--
and
which
it
should
take
judicial
notice
of
that
there's
been
a
long
friction
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
between
what
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
thought
it
could
do
honestly,
i
suppose,
in
terms
of
section
332
and
section
137,
section
372,
perhaps
section
371
of
title
28.
and
this
--
a
friction
has
manifested
itself
ultimately
in
the
final
order
of
the
judicial
council
which
was
not
its
first
order
against
this
judge.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
there
are
references
to
the
occidental
petroleum
case
and
to
the
texaco
case
that
referred
to
the
judicial
council's
order,
not
by
name,
but
simply
saying
that
the
judge
has
been
involved
in
criminal
and
civil
litigation
which
has
had
some
impact
that
speak
of
his
attitude
and
his
conduct
and
the
efficiency
of
the
court
without
any
factual
showing
as
to
how
these
relate
in
any
manner
to
the
difficulties
any
federal
judge
has
over
many
years
in
dealing
with
complicated
cases
and
complicated
litigants.
the
first
question
which
concerns
me
against
this
historical
background
is
the
--
the
threshold
question,
as
the
solicitor
general
calls
it,
of
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
which
some
of
the
justices
have
raised.
our
position
is
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
under
section
1651
of
title
28,
that
being
the
all
writs
act,
which
incorporates
as
we
understand
it
and
as
we
understand,
the
solicitor
general
understands
it.
it
incorporates
the
old
sections
13
and
14
of
the
original
judiciary
act
of
1789.
and
although
judge
mcgruder
and
i
guess
the
josephson
case
perhaps
it
suggested
that
there
had
been
some
change
by
reason
of
the
revision
of
these
older
sections
into
the
present
section
1651,
the
all
writs
act.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
that
act.
a
second
point
i
think
i
would
touch
on
briefly
is
that
in
our
brief,
we
suggested
that
the
court
had
inherent
power.
and
we
also
mentioned
that
it
would
have
power
under
the
due
process
proceed
--
provisions
of
the
constitution
to
deal
with
the
matter
of
this
extraordinary
significance,
in
this
context,
in
this
historical
context,
and
in
--
and
then
the
practical
immediate
context
because
here,
these
are
live
judges
operating
a
very
important
circuit
of
where
we've
had
a
long
running
situation
that's
resulted
in
an
interference
by
somebody
with
the
operation
of
that
court.
our
position
is
the
tenth
judicial
council
has
unconstitutionally
not
impeached
the
judge
and
removed
the
judge
from
the
office,
but
they've
removed
the
office
from
the
judge
in
a
kind
of
reverse
english
procedure
which
certainly
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
because
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
our
judgment
on
the
face.
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution
relating
to
this
matter
are
so
explicit
in
setting
up
a
special
court
in
the
senate
that
requires
a
two-thirds
vote
where
everybody's
on
oath
and
it
names
who
the
chief
justice
and
providing
officers
shall
be,
and
exactly
what
the
procedure
shall
be
in
the
judicial
proceeding
to
convict
somebody.
and
all
of
these
things
we
think
come
within
the
type
of
problem,
which
is
contemplated,
can
be
reached
under
section
1651
under
the
extraordinary
writs.
these
are
the
kind
of
extraordinary
circumstances,
the
actual
judicial
council
here
that
--
that
energize
and
bring
the
section
1651
into
play.
now,
the
inherent
powers,
we
didn't
just
make
up
the
term.
this
tenth
judicial
council
and
at
least
three
of
the
cases
cited
in
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
i
say
the
solicitor
general's
brief
does
not
touch
on
this.
it
makes
reference
to
the
fact
they
never
heard
of
this
court
suggesting
it
had
inherent
powers.
but
in
the
ritter
case
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
the
texaco
case
and
the
occidental
petroleum
case,
all
three,
the
court
there
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“we're
exercising
our
power
under
section
1651
or
our
inherent
appellate
jurisdiction.”
they
didn't
care
which,
and
they
specifically
stated
it
in
all
three
cases,
and
that's
how
they
acted
to
--
to
issue
extraordinary
writs
against
judge
chandler
in
these
specific
cases,
which
lie
at
the
base
of
the
existing
order
which
we
challenge.
now,
the
second
problem
that
seems
to
me
that
we're
concerned
with
is
the
solicitor
general,
and
putting
aside
professor
wright's
position,
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
we
follow
the
solicitor
general
on
that.
we
think
it
does,
for
the
reasons
he
addresses
himself
to
and
the
reasons
i
have
set
forth.
the
second
problem
is
whether
or
not,
and
as
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
he
says,
“either
the
case
is
moot
or
judge
chandler
is
estopped
from
being
here
because
he
has
agreed
to
the
present
division
of
business
in
his
court.”
on
the
question
of
agreement,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
this
was
a
kind
of
a
--
this
was
not
the
kind
of
a
--
of
an
agreement
that
can
lead
to
estoppel,
just
as
it
was
not
the
kind
of
disagreement
that
would
energize
section
137
of
title
28,
that
is
the
--
it
would
energize
or
activate
the
statutory
authority
whereby
the
tenth
judicial
council
could
divide
the
business
of
the
court.
and
on
that
point,
let
me
say
i
would
not
agree
that
an
exercise
of
section
137
so
extreme
that
it
deprived
the
judge
of
all
his
cases
was
a
constitutional
exercise
of
that
authority.
i
think
137
has
to
be
measured
against
what
they're
trying
to
do,
and
it
cannot
be
used
to
deprive
a
judge
of
his
office
any
more
than
section
332
can.
it
can
be
used
when
it's
activated
properly
by
a
genuine
and
bona
fide
disagreement
to
divide
the
business
of
the
court
so
we
can
get
on
with
the
judicial
business
of
the
nation.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
that
first
order,
the
order
we
challenge,
was
moot,
i
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
grant
case
we
cite
and
to
this
court's
more
recent
case
in
the
american
phosphate
exporters
case,
which
was
decided
last
november
which
addresses
itself
to
this
problem
of
mootness
and
i
just
have
a
--
just
a
word
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
the
court
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
i
think
the
court
simply
has
to
look
at
the
record
before
it.
this
matter
came
before
this
court
on
the
tenth
judicial
council's
original
order
of
december
13,
1965
where
they
said,
and
i
quote
directly
from
the
order,
“in
the
past
four
years,
the
judicial
council
at
many
meetings
has
discussed
and
considered
the
business
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
and
has
done
so
with
particular
regard
to
the
effect
thereon
of
the
attitude
and
conduct.”
so
these
are
not
words
in
any
statute.
they
made
them
up,
and
they
could
make
up
a
lot
more
and
any
judicial
council
could
at
this
court
authorize
this
kind
of
action.
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
judge
chandler,
who
as
chief
judge
of
the
district,
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
administration
of
such
business.
during
that
period,
judge
chandler
has
been
a
party
defendant
in
both
civil
and
criminal
litigation.
one
civil
case
is
still
pending
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
this
is
the
first
order
which
we
challenge
and
which
we
say
is
not
moot,
and
we
rely
on
the
american
export
case
which
points
out
that
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
takes
subsequent
curative
action
doesn't
remove
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
if
you'll
look
at
the
order
itself
under
section
332
of
the
original
order,
which
is
not
moot
when
you
look
at
the
cases,
and
which
simply
stated
in
terms
that
the
judge
was
literally,
his
office
was
taken
away
from
him
then
and
there,
and
his
cases
were
to
be
reassigned.
section
137
had
not
been
energized.
they
had
no
authority
under
section
137.
there
was
no
disagreement
as
to
the
assignment
of
the
work.
there's
no
showing
there
was
a
backlog.
there
was
no
showing
the
court
wasn't
operating
efficiently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statistics
from
the
office
--
the
administrative
office
showed
just
the
opposite.
he
was
doing
his
work
and
everybody
else
was
doing
theirs.
there
wasn't
the
slightest
question
of
the
efficiency
of
that
court.
the
question
was
just
what
they
said,
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
the
judge.
they
plainly
didn't
like
it.
there
was
no
objection
from
the
bar
association,
no
objection
from
litigants,
no
objection
from
the
lawyers
in
the
town,
no
objection
from
anybody,
except
the
tenth
judicial
council.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir.
they
would
have
no
such
authority
under
the
federal
constitution.
i
doubt
that
congress
would
have
the
authority
to
give
any
such
jurisdictional
authority
to
anybody.
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
overall
these
many
years
and
pending
bills
in
congress,
there'd
been
dozens
and
hundreds
of
them.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
only
the
tenth
circuit
says
it
has
it.
it
says
they
have
inherent
appellate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir.
i
think
the
united
states
itself
through
the
solicitor
general
has
weapons
available,
writ
of
quo
warranto.
it
could
follow
some
of
its
own
suggestions.
it
could
challenge
any
public
officer
who
wasn't
doing
his
duty
in
a
certain
way
but
it
--
i
think
the
constitution
sets
up
a
special
court
to
deal
with
judges
and
their
tenure
and
just
as
the
president
has
four
years,
a
judge
is
appointed
for
good
behavior.
and
when
that
question
of
good
behavior
is
to
be
resolved,
the
congress
itself
must
do
it
in
a
special
court
provided
in
the
constitution
with
a
two-thirds
vote
which
no
pardon
can
issue
under
the
constitution.
the
president
can't
pardon
the
person
and
he's
only
removed
from
his
office
and
if
there's
a
crime
or
something
else
involved,
then
he
can
be
subsequently
subjected
to
double
jeopardy,
let
us
say,
and
prosecuted
again.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
impeachment
would
merely
--
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
no,
sir
and
the
record
of
impeachments
in
the
--
in
the
history
of
our
country
show
that
federal
judges
have
been
impeached
for
drunkenness
and
convicted.
they
have
been
impeached
for
corruption.
there
haven't
been
many
because
this
--
these
aren't
the
type
of
men
that
are
appointed
to
the
federal
judiciary,
but
the
weapon
is
there
and
can
be
used
and
the
procedures
are
very
adequate
to
serve
so
important
purpose.
may
i
ask
the
clerk
what
the
white
light
means?
am
i
out
of
time
or
am
i
within
some
minutes
of
being
out
of
time?
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
and
the
red
light,
i'll
be
out
of
time,
because
mr.
--
my
colleague
ran
over
so
badly
there,
i
don't
know
just
where
we
are.
i'll
continue
for
the
five
minutes.
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
of
the
five
minutes?
mr.
carl
l.
shipley
well,
i
think
we've
run
out
of
our
time
here
and
i
do
have
some
points
i
want
to
address
myself,
too,
and
i
want
to
know
when
the
time
was
up
for
our
side
in
the
matter.
if
the
court
please,
a
very
--
another
very
important
question
which
has
come
up
is
--
the
solicitor
general
i'm
sure
will
address
himself
to
is
whether
or
not
judge
chandler
has
agreed
to
the
present
division
of
business.
and
that
by
this
agreement,
he's
--
although
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
knew
that
he
use
the
term
that
he's
estopped,
whether
or
not
by
this
agreement,
it
makes
the
case
moot
or
removes
any
colors
for
this
court
to
get
into
what
the
solicitor
general
calls
the
delicate
question,
constitutional
questions
involved
in
section
332.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
judge
chandler's
agreement
was
not
a
bona
fide
agreement
in
the
sense
that
the
law
would
contemplate
it
that
it
should
be
to
a
estopping
from
complaining
about
something
to
which
he
had
agreed.
his
agreement
was
simply,
he
put
right
in
the
letter
that
he
was
signing
under
protest
to
avoid
creating
a
disagreement
and
that
he
would
expect
to
address
himself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
of
the
tenth
judicial
council,
as
outlined
in
our
brief.
i
see
that
my
time
has
come
out,
and
i'll
just
close
on
saying
this,
that
i
--
we
agree
with
congressman
celler
and
other
scholars
who
have
said
that
good
behavior,
attitude,
conduct
in
these
matters
are
not
just
issue.
they're
not
questions
that
can
be
tried
in
any
place
except
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
acting
as
a
court
of
impeachment
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
and
therefore,
we
would
say
this
court,
in
order
to
clarify
the
matter,
not
to
avoid
what's
the
delicate
problem
but
to
solve
what's
been
150
years
of
a
complicated
problem
should
speak
forthrightly
and
completely
and
totally
so
that
the
federal
judges
will
know,
the
judicial
councils
will
know
exactly
where
their
authority
begins
and
ends
under
section
137
and
under
section
332,
because
if
this
court
says
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
and
steps
away
from
this
case,
it
will
compound
what
is
a
very
serious
situation
which
will
continue
in
all
the
judicial
circuits.
some
of
them
may
run
wild.
we
don't
know
what
will
happen,
but
certainly,
these
are
human
beings
with
the
same
personality
frailties
that
have
given
rise
to
this
case
and
brought
all
of
us
here
today.
thank
you.
