mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
possible
misunderstanding
which
results
from
the
way
this
case
was
listed
in
the
hearing
list
by
the
clerk's
office.
it
is
there
said
that
the
solicitor
general
will
appear
as
a
friend
of
the
court
for
the
respondent.
i
do
not
understand
that
i
am
appearing
for
the
respondent
or
for
the
petitioner
and
that
was
the
first
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
but
simply
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
i
have
tried
with
the
aid
of
my
former
associate,
philip
lacovara
to
make
a
complete
on
examination
of
the
problems
here
as
we
could
in
an
effort
to
be
as
helpful
to
the
court
as
possible.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
true
--
[laughter]
a
true
friend
of
the
court.
the
first
question
to
which
i
will
address
myself
is
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
this
matter.
it
is
plain
of
course
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
only
as
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
that
this
case
is
here
as
an
original
matter.
it
is
obvious
that
neither
the
united
states
nor
a
state
nor
a
foreign
minister
or
ambassador
is
a
party
and
there
is
no
basis
for
original
jurisdiction.
i
may
say
that
when
i
started
consideration
of
this
case,
i
had
the
tentative
view
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
here,
that
this
was
not
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
that
indeed,
the
argument
presented
by
professor
wright
was
the
sound
analysis.
i
learned
my
federal
jurisdiction
from
professor
frankfurter
and
i
tend
to
take
a
rather
strict
view
of
these
matters
and
also
to
regard
them
as
important.
but
after
my
associate,
who
i
regret
has
now
left
the
government
service,
mr.
lacovara,
presented
me
an
elaborate
memorandum
on
the
matter
and
i
discussed
it
with
him
at
some
length.
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
probably
wrong.
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
i
do
not
regard
this
as
by
any
means
a
matter
of
black
and
white.
it
will
be
clearer
after
this
court
has
decided
it
and
it
is
not.
but
it
does
not
help
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
this
is
administrative
action.
that
is
an
example
of
the
tyranny
of
words
because
if
this
is
a
judicial
administration,
it
may
present
a
situation
which
is
different
than
anything
with
which
the
court
has
previously
dealt.
it
is
of
course
clear
and
accepted
in
many
fields
that
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
dealing
with
and
that
the
understanding
of
the
constitution
grows
and
develops
with
the
development
of
problems,
and
the
approach
is
to
problems.
it
was
probably
true
at
an
earlier
time
that
we
had
a
very
small
conception
of
judicial
administration
of
the
function
and
responsibility
of
courts
in
seeing
to
it
that
their
business
is
soundly
and
effectively
handled,
in
addition
to
the
process
of
the
actual
decision
of
the
case
in
court.
over
the
past
generation,
there's
been
a
great
expansion
in
the
awareness
of
the
importance
of
the
function
of
the
judicial
administration,
and
we
have
people
like
chief
justice
hughes
and
chief
justice
groner
and
judge
parker
and
arthur
vanderbilt
and
others
who
were
largely
responsible
for
the
development
of
the
statutory
provisions
which
now
exist,
establishing
not
only
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
which
is
not
involved
here
in
any
way
whatever,
but
also
the
judicial
councils.
now,
the
judicial
council,
it
is
perfectly
plain
or
simply
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
no
district
judges
sitting
on
the
judicial
councils.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
judicial
councils
consist
of
simply
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
says
--
the
statute
says
that
the
--
the
chief
judge
of
each
circuit,
this
is
section
332
of
title
28,
shall
call
at
least
twice
in
each
year
and
at
such
places
as
he
may
designate
a
council
of
the
circuit
judges
for
the
circuit
in
regular
active
service
at
which
he
shall
preside.
each
circuit
judge,
unless
excused
by
the
chief
judge,
shall
attend
all
sessions
of
the
council.
no
reference
to
district
judges,
no
exceptions
from
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
except
that
it
applies
only
to
those
in
regular
active
service.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do,
sir.
i
see
no
reason
why
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
can
--
they
can
certainly
engage
in
discussion
as
this
court
engages
in
conferences
which
are
not
public
sessions.
whether
they
can
take
actions
which
are
valid
in
the
form
of
orders
in
other
than
a
public
session,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
that
orders
issued
from
this
court
which
do
not
come
forth
in
a
public
session,
i
don't
see
why
that
is
an
earmark
of
judicial
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
always
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sometimes,
not
much
opportunity
for
briefing
in
terms
of
stay
orders
and
things
of
that
kind
which
are
done
by
the
court.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
in
section
137
of
title
28,
the
statute
now
reads
that
--
this
is
the
last
paragraph
of
section
137
--
if
the
district
judges
in
any
district
are
unable
to
agree
upon
the
adoption
of
rules
or
orders
for
that
purpose,
it
now
says
the
judicial
council
of
the
circuit
shall
make
the
necessary
orders.
it
would
be
only
a
verbal
difference
if
it
said
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
shall
make
the
necessary
orders.
and
similarly
in
section
332,
the
last
paragraph
which
is
at
the
top
of
page
4
of
my
brief,
it
says,
“each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders.”
and
there
again,
if
it
said
each
court
of
appeal
sitting
en
banc
shall
make
all
necessary
orders,
it
would
be
exactly
what
we
have
here
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
what
is
a
verbal
difference
only,
having
no
effect
upon
either
of
the
persons
who
participate
or
the
capacity
in
which
they
participate,
should
make
this
into
something
which
is
non-judicial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statue
provides
as
to
this
that
the
chief
judge
shall
convene
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
a
majority
of
the
court,
it
couldn't
take
five
votes
in
the
first
circuit
because
there
are
only
three
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
whether
the
chief
judge
has
any
authority
with
respect
to
convening
the
court
en
banc
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
could
simply
provide
him
the
statute
that
the
court
sitting
en
banc
could
be
convened
by
the
chief
judge
for
this
purpose.
it
still
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
is
doing
--
what
the
judicial
council
is
doing
here
is
exercising
what
has
come
to
be
recognized
not
only
as
judicial
power
but
as
an
important
judicial
responsibility
to
see
that
the
judicial
business
of
the
circuit
is
effectively
and
expeditiously
administered.
this
was
not
an
accident.
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
action.
it
grew
out
of
such
experiences
as
those
which
chief
justice
taft
lived
through
in
the
1920s
when
there
was
no
such
power.
and
i
just
happened
on
a
letter
written
by
chief
justice
taft
in
the
1920s
in
alpheus
mason's
biography
of
taft.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
a
district
judge
who
had
not
disposed
of
a
case
which
had
been
pending
before
him
for
four
years
and
he
felt
that
he
had
to
put
into
that
letter
the
following,
and
think
of
this
from
an
ex-president
and
chief
justice
of
the
united
states.
“of
course,
i
write
this
letter
with
no
assumption
that
i
may
exercise
direct
authority
over
you
in
the
discharge
of
your
duties,
but
as
head
of
the
federal
judiciary,
i
feel
i
do
have
to
appeal
to
you
in
its
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
the
public
whom
it
is
created
to
serve
to
end
this
indefinite
situation.”
and
the
objective,
the
intended
objective
was
to
provide
a
judicial
authority
within
the
judiciary,
nobody
outside,
no
executive
authority,
no
legislative
authority,
but
the
courts
were
to
run
their
own
house
or
to
do
it
without
interference
and
their
representative
said
that,
“give
us
the
chance.
give
us
that
power
and
we
will
take
care
of
it.”
now,
it
is
also
clear
that
they
contemplated
that
it
would
be
--
that
it
would
very
rarely
be
necessary
to
do
anything
to
enforce
it.
these
are
high
level
people
and
if
it
became
necessary
for
the
judicial
council
to
issue
an
order,
the
odds
were
very
strong
that
it
would
be
complied
with
however
reluctantly.
but
the
statute
does
expressly
give
the
judicial
council,
which
i
repeat
is
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
by
another
name.
it
does
give
them
expressly
authority
to
make
those
orders
and
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
district
judges
to
carry
them
out.
such
an
order
was
issued
in
this
case.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
case
or
controversy
is
met
here.
chief
judge
chandler
sought
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
or
prohibition
to
review
the
validity
of
that
order.
and
though
as
i've
said,
it
is
not
fully
clear,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
was
a
judicial
order
entered
by
a
judicial
body
in
carrying
out
judicial
responsibility
and
that
the
review
of
that
order
before
this
court
is
an
exercise
of
appellate
and
not
original
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
turn
to
the
question
on
the
merits
where
i
do
agree
with
professor
wright's
position
in
representation
of
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council.
in
the
first
place,
the
only
paper
before
this
court,
the
only
pleading
before
this
court
is
judge
chandler's
petition
or
motion
for
leave
to
file
and
petition
for
a
writ
or
mandamus,
which
was
filed
in
january
1966.
and
in
that
petition,
he
prays
that
a
writ
or
prohibition
or
a
mandamus
be
issued
to
restrain
the
respondent
from
exceeding
its
jurisdictional
power.
in
ordering
that
until
its
further
order,
the
petitioner
shall
take
no
action
whatsoever
in
any
case
or
proceeding
now
or
hereafter
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
and
that
order
no
longer
exists.
it
was
completely
superseded
on
february
4,
1966
in
the
document
which
is
marked
f
in
the
return
or
response,
which
has
been
filed
by
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference.
and
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
since
that
date,
there
has
been
no
dispute,
no
controversy
between
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
and
judge
chandler.
now,
i
think
that
that
can
most
clearly
be
shown
by
examining
the
item,
which
is
item
k
in
the
return
of
the
tenth
circuit,
which
is
a
letter
on
the
stationery
of
judge
chandler
signed
by
all
five
judges
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma,
leading
off
with
stephen
j.
chandler
as
the
first
signature
addressed
to
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference
in
response
to
the
letter
of
the
honorable
davis
t.
lewis
to
the
active
judges
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
in
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
the
judicial
council
attached
thereto,
“we
advise
that
the
current
order
for
the
division
of
business
in
this
district
is
agreeable
under
the
circumstances.”
now
judge
chandler
makes
a
lot
out
of
that
“under
the
circumstances.”
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
his
previous
letter
in
february
1966
by
which
he
joined
with
the
other
judges
in
agreement
as
to
the
division
of
the
business
was
under
protest.
he
says
that
this
is
under
duress.
however,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
judge
chandler
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
he
cannot
either
consent
and
not
consent
at
the
same
time.
by
this
letter,
he
has
consented.
there
is
thus
no
dispute
between
him
and
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
he
has
unconditionally
consented.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
what
under
the
circumstances
means
there.
these
are
the
--
i
suppose
anyone
acts
under
the
circumstances,
any
appearance
or
any
consent
is,
but
if
judge
chandler
does
not
consent,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
say
so,
in
which
case,
it
will
become
incumbent
on
the
judicial
council
under
section
137
to
issue
an
order
for
the
division
of
judicial
business
in
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
and
if
judge
chandler
doesn't
like
that
order,
he
can
take
whatever
steps
may
be
appropriate
at
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
not
only
entitled
but
i
don't
believe
they
have
any
power
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
only
all
of
the
judges
of
the
--
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
can
agree
as
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
they
can,
and
i
believe
that
if
they
do,
the
judicial
council
has
no
authority
with
respect
to
it
and
if
that
results
in
an
inappropriate
situation,
it
can
be
reported
to
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
they
can
consider
whether
this
is
an
occasion
for
impeachment.
now,
there
may
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
possibilities
under
section
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i'm
about
to
qualify
it,
if
i
may
be
allowed
to.
there
may
be
possibilities
under
section
332.
i
was
thinking
solely
in
terms
of
section
137,
the
division
of
judicial
business
in
the
district.
there
may
be
circumstances
which
would
be
relevant
with
respect
to
that
under
section
332
under
which
each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
administration
of
the
business
of
the
courts
within
its
circuit,
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
--
all
of
the
district
judges
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
entered
an
order
by
which
they
agreed
that
no
business
would
be
assigned
to
any
of
them,
that
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
act
under
section
332
and
it
would
then
be
the
statutory
duty,
as
well
as
the
moral
duty
of
the
judges
to
carry
out
that
order.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it's
the
--
it
is
the
statutory
responsibility
of
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
and
thereby
being
known
as
the
judicial
councils
to
make
appropriate
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
handling
of
the
business
of
the
district
courts
and
a
situation
where
all
of
the
district
judges
in
a
district
fail
to
meet
their
responsibilities
would
clearly
be
a
situation
calling
for
the
exercise
of
that
power.
now,
various
things
have
been
said
about
the
order
which
was
entered
by
the
judicial
council
in
december
of
1965
that
it
was
done
without
a
hearing
and
without
notice
and
so
on.
in
our
brief,
we
indicate
that
we
think
that
as
of
that
time,
it
may
have
been
difficult
to
support
that
action.
it
was
quickly
explained
as
having
been
interlocutory
and
i
can
conceive
of
situations
where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
take
action
of
this
sort
without
a
hearing
and
indeed
without
notice
just
as
courts
repeatedly
grant
temporary
restraining
orders
on
ex
parte
applications
because
something
has
to
be
done
quickly.
i
can
imagine
a
situation
where
a
judge
should
go
on
stark
raving
mad
and
something
had
to
be
done.
i
can
imagine
situations
where
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
order
that
no
further
cases
be
assigned
to
a
judge
and
that
he
not
sit
on
any
pending
cases
presumably
after
a
notice
and
a
hearing.
for
example,
if
a
judge
were
indicted
for
having
accepted
bribes
in
connection
with
his
handling
of
the
cases
and
he
announced,
“well,
who
cares
about
that?
i'll
be
in
court
monday,
you
can
go
ahead.”
i
can
imagine
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
issue
an
order
such
as
was
issued
here
or
even
stronger
than
was
issued
here,
providing
that
he
should
no
longer
--
should
not
sit
on
pending
matters
and
should
have
no
new
matters
assigned
to
him
until
the
indictment
had
been
disposed
of.
now,
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
is
my
own
view
that
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
did
not
act
with
the
proper
procedures,
but
on
february
4,
1966,
that
order
was
completely
superseded,
it
is
no
longer
in
effect.
i
don't
think
the
antitrust
case
of
last
year
has
any
real
application
to
this.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
threat
or
risk
that
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
will
do
further
acts
which
would
be
inappropriate.
since
february
4,
1966,
the
only
order
that
has
been
outstanding
has
been
one
which
is
in
entire
accord
with
the
position
of
judge
chandler.
item
one,
judge
chandler
has
agreed
with
the
judges
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
that
no
new
business
will
be
assigned
to
him.
and
item
two,
all
pending
cases
before
judge
chandler
are
left
to
him
without
interference
in
any
way.
he
thus
has
exactly
what
he
asks
for
currently.
if
he
thinks
that
isn't
all
that
he
wants,
he
can
change
it.
with
respect
to
pending
cases
that
may
soon
be
cleared
out.
with
respect
to
future
cases,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
tell
his
fellow
district
judges
that
he
doesn't
agree
and
that
he
wants
some
cases
assigned
to
him.
if
his
fellow
judges
do
agree
to
assign
cases
to
him
and
he
accepts
that,
there
will
be
no
disagreement
and
there
will
be
no
basis
for
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
to
act
under
section
137.
if
on
the
other
hand
his
fellow
district
judges
do
not
agree,
then
there
will
be
a
disagreement.
it
will
be
appropriate
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
take
whatever
action
may
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstances,
and
i
have
no
idea
what
that
action
would
be.
thus,
i
submit
for
the
court's
consideration
that
although
it
is
novel
that
this
is
a
case
within
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
but
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
should
be
denied
because
there
is
no
longer
any
existing
controversy
outstanding.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
possible
misunderstanding
which
results
from
the
way
this
case
was
listed
in
the
hearing
list
by
the
clerk's
office.
it
is
there
said
that
the
solicitor
general
will
appear
as
a
friend
of
the
court
for
the
respondent.
i
do
not
understand
that
i
am
appearing
for
the
respondent
or
for
the
petitioner
and
that
was
the
first
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
but
simply
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
i
have
tried
with
the
aid
of
my
former
associate,
philip
lacovara
to
make
a
complete
on
examination
of
the
problems
here
as
we
could
in
an
effort
to
be
as
helpful
to
the
court
as
possible.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
true
--
[laughter]
a
true
friend
of
the
court.
the
first
question
to
which
i
will
address
myself
is
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
this
matter.
it
is
plain
of
course
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
only
as
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
that
this
case
is
here
as
an
original
matter.
it
is
obvious
that
neither
the
united
states
nor
a
state
nor
a
foreign
minister
or
ambassador
is
a
party
and
there
is
no
basis
for
original
jurisdiction.
i
may
say
that
when
i
started
consideration
of
this
case,
i
had
the
tentative
view
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
here,
that
this
was
not
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
that
indeed,
the
argument
presented
by
professor
wright
was
the
sound
analysis.
i
learned
my
federal
jurisdiction
from
professor
frankfurter
and
i
tend
to
take
a
rather
strict
view
of
these
matters
and
also
to
regard
them
as
important.
but
after
my
associate,
who
i
regret
has
now
left
the
government
service,
mr.
lacovara,
presented
me
an
elaborate
memorandum
on
the
matter
and
i
discussed
it
with
him
at
some
length.
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
probably
wrong.
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
i
do
not
regard
this
as
by
any
means
a
matter
of
black
and
white.
it
will
be
clearer
after
this
court
has
decided
it
and
it
is
not.
but
it
does
not
help
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
this
is
administrative
action.
that
is
an
example
of
the
tyranny
of
words
because
if
this
is
a
judicial
administration,
it
may
present
a
situation
which
is
different
than
anything
with
which
the
court
has
previously
dealt.
it
is
of
course
clear
and
accepted
in
many
fields
that
it
is
a
constitution
we
are
dealing
with
and
that
the
understanding
of
the
constitution
grows
and
develops
with
the
development
of
problems,
and
the
approach
is
to
problems.
it
was
probably
true
at
an
earlier
time
that
we
had
a
very
small
conception
of
judicial
administration
of
the
function
and
responsibility
of
courts
in
seeing
to
it
that
their
business
is
soundly
and
effectively
handled,
in
addition
to
the
process
of
the
actual
decision
of
the
case
in
court.
over
the
past
generation,
there's
been
a
great
expansion
in
the
awareness
of
the
importance
of
the
function
of
the
judicial
administration,
and
we
have
people
like
chief
justice
hughes
and
chief
justice
groner
and
judge
parker
and
arthur
vanderbilt
and
others
who
were
largely
responsible
for
the
development
of
the
statutory
provisions
which
now
exist,
establishing
not
only
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
which
is
not
involved
here
in
any
way
whatever,
but
also
the
judicial
councils.
now,
the
judicial
council,
it
is
perfectly
plain
or
simply
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
no
district
judges
sitting
on
the
judicial
councils.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
judicial
councils
consist
of
simply
the
judges
of
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
says
--
the
statute
says
that
the
--
the
chief
judge
of
each
circuit,
this
is
section
332
of
title
28,
shall
call
at
least
twice
in
each
year
and
at
such
places
as
he
may
designate
a
council
of
the
circuit
judges
for
the
circuit
in
regular
active
service
at
which
he
shall
preside.
each
circuit
judge,
unless
excused
by
the
chief
judge,
shall
attend
all
sessions
of
the
council.
no
reference
to
district
judges,
no
exceptions
from
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
except
that
it
applies
only
to
those
in
regular
active
service.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do,
sir.
i
see
no
reason
why
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
can
--
they
can
certainly
engage
in
discussion
as
this
court
engages
in
conferences
which
are
not
public
sessions.
whether
they
can
take
actions
which
are
valid
in
the
form
of
orders
in
other
than
a
public
session,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
that
orders
issued
from
this
court
which
do
not
come
forth
in
a
public
session,
i
don't
see
why
that
is
an
earmark
of
judicial
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
always
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
sometimes,
not
much
opportunity
for
briefing
in
terms
of
stay
orders
and
things
of
that
kind
which
are
done
by
the
court.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
in
section
137
of
title
28,
the
statute
now
reads
that
--
this
is
the
last
paragraph
of
section
137
--
if
the
district
judges
in
any
district
are
unable
to
agree
upon
the
adoption
of
rules
or
orders
for
that
purpose,
it
now
says
the
judicial
council
of
the
circuit
shall
make
the
necessary
orders.
it
would
be
only
a
verbal
difference
if
it
said
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
shall
make
the
necessary
orders.
and
similarly
in
section
332,
the
last
paragraph
which
is
at
the
top
of
page
4
of
my
brief,
it
says,
“each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders.”
and
there
again,
if
it
said
each
court
of
appeal
sitting
en
banc
shall
make
all
necessary
orders,
it
would
be
exactly
what
we
have
here
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
what
is
a
verbal
difference
only,
having
no
effect
upon
either
of
the
persons
who
participate
or
the
capacity
in
which
they
participate,
should
make
this
into
something
which
is
non-judicial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statue
provides
as
to
this
that
the
chief
judge
shall
convene
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
maybe
a
majority
of
the
court,
it
couldn't
take
five
votes
in
the
first
circuit
because
there
are
only
three
there.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
know,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
whether
the
chief
judge
has
any
authority
with
respect
to
convening
the
court
en
banc
or
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
could
simply
provide
him
the
statute
that
the
court
sitting
en
banc
could
be
convened
by
the
chief
judge
for
this
purpose.
it
still
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
is
doing
--
what
the
judicial
council
is
doing
here
is
exercising
what
has
come
to
be
recognized
not
only
as
judicial
power
but
as
an
important
judicial
responsibility
to
see
that
the
judicial
business
of
the
circuit
is
effectively
and
expeditiously
administered.
this
was
not
an
accident.
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
action.
it
grew
out
of
such
experiences
as
those
which
chief
justice
taft
lived
through
in
the
1920s
when
there
was
no
such
power.
and
i
just
happened
on
a
letter
written
by
chief
justice
taft
in
the
1920s
in
alpheus
mason's
biography
of
taft.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
a
district
judge
who
had
not
disposed
of
a
case
which
had
been
pending
before
him
for
four
years
and
he
felt
that
he
had
to
put
into
that
letter
the
following,
and
think
of
this
from
an
ex-president
and
chief
justice
of
the
united
states.
“of
course,
i
write
this
letter
with
no
assumption
that
i
may
exercise
direct
authority
over
you
in
the
discharge
of
your
duties,
but
as
head
of
the
federal
judiciary,
i
feel
i
do
have
to
appeal
to
you
in
its
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
the
public
whom
it
is
created
to
serve
to
end
this
indefinite
situation.”
and
the
objective,
the
intended
objective
was
to
provide
a
judicial
authority
within
the
judiciary,
nobody
outside,
no
executive
authority,
no
legislative
authority,
but
the
courts
were
to
run
their
own
house
or
to
do
it
without
interference
and
their
representative
said
that,
“give
us
the
chance.
give
us
that
power
and
we
will
take
care
of
it.”
now,
it
is
also
clear
that
they
contemplated
that
it
would
be
--
that
it
would
very
rarely
be
necessary
to
do
anything
to
enforce
it.
these
are
high
level
people
and
if
it
became
necessary
for
the
judicial
council
to
issue
an
order,
the
odds
were
very
strong
that
it
would
be
complied
with
however
reluctantly.
but
the
statute
does
expressly
give
the
judicial
council,
which
i
repeat
is
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
by
another
name.
it
does
give
them
expressly
authority
to
make
those
orders
and
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
district
judges
to
carry
them
out.
such
an
order
was
issued
in
this
case.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
case
or
controversy
is
met
here.
chief
judge
chandler
sought
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
or
prohibition
to
review
the
validity
of
that
order.
and
though
as
i've
said,
it
is
not
fully
clear,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
was
a
judicial
order
entered
by
a
judicial
body
in
carrying
out
judicial
responsibility
and
that
the
review
of
that
order
before
this
court
is
an
exercise
of
appellate
and
not
original
jurisdiction.
now,
i
would
turn
to
the
question
on
the
merits
where
i
do
agree
with
professor
wright's
position
in
representation
of
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council.
in
the
first
place,
the
only
paper
before
this
court,
the
only
pleading
before
this
court
is
judge
chandler's
petition
or
motion
for
leave
to
file
and
petition
for
a
writ
or
mandamus,
which
was
filed
in
january
1966.
and
in
that
petition,
he
prays
that
a
writ
or
prohibition
or
a
mandamus
be
issued
to
restrain
the
respondent
from
exceeding
its
jurisdictional
power.
in
ordering
that
until
its
further
order,
the
petitioner
shall
take
no
action
whatsoever
in
any
case
or
proceeding
now
or
hereafter
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
and
that
order
no
longer
exists.
it
was
completely
superseded
on
february
4,
1966
in
the
document
which
is
marked
f
in
the
return
or
response,
which
has
been
filed
by
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference.
and
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
since
that
date,
there
has
been
no
dispute,
no
controversy
between
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
and
judge
chandler.
now,
i
think
that
that
can
most
clearly
be
shown
by
examining
the
item,
which
is
item
k
in
the
return
of
the
tenth
circuit,
which
is
a
letter
on
the
stationery
of
judge
chandler
signed
by
all
five
judges
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma,
leading
off
with
stephen
j.
chandler
as
the
first
signature
addressed
to
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference
in
response
to
the
letter
of
the
honorable
davis
t.
lewis
to
the
active
judges
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
in
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
the
judicial
council
attached
thereto,
“we
advise
that
the
current
order
for
the
division
of
business
in
this
district
is
agreeable
under
the
circumstances.”
now
judge
chandler
makes
a
lot
out
of
that
“under
the
circumstances.”
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
his
previous
letter
in
february
1966
by
which
he
joined
with
the
other
judges
in
agreement
as
to
the
division
of
the
business
was
under
protest.
he
says
that
this
is
under
duress.
however,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
judge
chandler
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
he
cannot
either
consent
and
not
consent
at
the
same
time.
by
this
letter,
he
has
consented.
there
is
thus
no
dispute
between
him
and
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
conference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
he
has
unconditionally
consented.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
know
what
under
the
circumstances
means
there.
these
are
the
--
i
suppose
anyone
acts
under
the
circumstances,
any
appearance
or
any
consent
is,
but
if
judge
chandler
does
not
consent,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
say
so,
in
which
case,
it
will
become
incumbent
on
the
judicial
council
under
section
137
to
issue
an
order
for
the
division
of
judicial
business
in
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
and
if
judge
chandler
doesn't
like
that
order,
he
can
take
whatever
steps
may
be
appropriate
at
that
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
not
only
entitled
but
i
don't
believe
they
have
any
power
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
only
all
of
the
judges
of
the
--
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
can
agree
as
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
they
can,
and
i
believe
that
if
they
do,
the
judicial
council
has
no
authority
with
respect
to
it
and
if
that
results
in
an
inappropriate
situation,
it
can
be
reported
to
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
they
can
consider
whether
this
is
an
occasion
for
impeachment.
now,
there
may
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
possibilities
under
section
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i'm
about
to
qualify
it,
if
i
may
be
allowed
to.
there
may
be
possibilities
under
section
332.
i
was
thinking
solely
in
terms
of
section
137,
the
division
of
judicial
business
in
the
district.
there
may
be
circumstances
which
would
be
relevant
with
respect
to
that
under
section
332
under
which
each
judicial
council
shall
make
all
necessary
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
administration
of
the
business
of
the
courts
within
its
circuit,
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
--
all
of
the
district
judges
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
entered
an
order
by
which
they
agreed
that
no
business
would
be
assigned
to
any
of
them,
that
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
act
under
section
332
and
it
would
then
be
the
statutory
duty,
as
well
as
the
moral
duty
of
the
judges
to
carry
out
that
order.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it's
the
--
it
is
the
statutory
responsibility
of
the
courts
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
and
thereby
being
known
as
the
judicial
councils
to
make
appropriate
orders
for
the
effective
and
expeditious
handling
of
the
business
of
the
district
courts
and
a
situation
where
all
of
the
district
judges
in
a
district
fail
to
meet
their
responsibilities
would
clearly
be
a
situation
calling
for
the
exercise
of
that
power.
now,
various
things
have
been
said
about
the
order
which
was
entered
by
the
judicial
council
in
december
of
1965
that
it
was
done
without
a
hearing
and
without
notice
and
so
on.
in
our
brief,
we
indicate
that
we
think
that
as
of
that
time,
it
may
have
been
difficult
to
support
that
action.
it
was
quickly
explained
as
having
been
interlocutory
and
i
can
conceive
of
situations
where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
take
action
of
this
sort
without
a
hearing
and
indeed
without
notice
just
as
courts
repeatedly
grant
temporary
restraining
orders
on
ex
parte
applications
because
something
has
to
be
done
quickly.
i
can
imagine
a
situation
where
a
judge
should
go
on
stark
raving
mad
and
something
had
to
be
done.
i
can
imagine
situations
where
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
order
that
no
further
cases
be
assigned
to
a
judge
and
that
he
not
sit
on
any
pending
cases
presumably
after
a
notice
and
a
hearing.
for
example,
if
a
judge
were
indicted
for
having
accepted
bribes
in
connection
with
his
handling
of
the
cases
and
he
announced,
“well,
who
cares
about
that?
i'll
be
in
court
monday,
you
can
go
ahead.”
i
can
imagine
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judicial
council
to
issue
an
order
such
as
was
issued
here
or
even
stronger
than
was
issued
here,
providing
that
he
should
no
longer
--
should
not
sit
on
pending
matters
and
should
have
no
new
matters
assigned
to
him
until
the
indictment
had
been
disposed
of.
now,
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
is
my
own
view
that
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
did
not
act
with
the
proper
procedures,
but
on
february
4,
1966,
that
order
was
completely
superseded,
it
is
no
longer
in
effect.
i
don't
think
the
antitrust
case
of
last
year
has
any
real
application
to
this.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
threat
or
risk
that
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
will
do
further
acts
which
would
be
inappropriate.
since
february
4,
1966,
the
only
order
that
has
been
outstanding
has
been
one
which
is
in
entire
accord
with
the
position
of
judge
chandler.
item
one,
judge
chandler
has
agreed
with
the
judges
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
that
no
new
business
will
be
assigned
to
him.
and
item
two,
all
pending
cases
before
judge
chandler
are
left
to
him
without
interference
in
any
way.
he
thus
has
exactly
what
he
asks
for
currently.
if
he
thinks
that
isn't
all
that
he
wants,
he
can
change
it.
with
respect
to
pending
cases
that
may
soon
be
cleared
out.
with
respect
to
future
cases,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
tell
his
fellow
district
judges
that
he
doesn't
agree
and
that
he
wants
some
cases
assigned
to
him.
if
his
fellow
judges
do
agree
to
assign
cases
to
him
and
he
accepts
that,
there
will
be
no
disagreement
and
there
will
be
no
basis
for
the
tenth
circuit
judicial
council
to
act
under
section
137.
if
on
the
other
hand
his
fellow
district
judges
do
not
agree,
then
there
will
be
a
disagreement.
it
will
be
appropriate
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
take
whatever
action
may
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstances,
and
i
have
no
idea
what
that
action
would
be.
thus,
i
submit
for
the
court's
consideration
that
although
it
is
novel
that
this
is
a
case
within
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
but
that
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
should
be
denied
because
there
is
no
longer
any
existing
controversy
outstanding.
