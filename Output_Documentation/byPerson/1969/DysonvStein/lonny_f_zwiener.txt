mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
holding
the
texas
obscenity
statute
unconstitutional.
the
case
arose
in
dallas,
texas
when
the
police
officers
under
search
warrants
seized
--
made
seizures
under
a
search
warrant
of
a
publication
entitled
“dallas
notes.”
it
was
a
newspaper
published
every
two
weeks.
the
officers
had
obtained
an
opinion
of
assistant
district
attorney
that
it
was
obscene.
they
applied
for
a
search
warrant.
they
did
make
a
seizure.
subsequently,
they
went
back
again
and
made
a
seizure
of
the
dallas
notes
and
other
items.
i
think
we
have
about
3
--15,
three-judge
courts
in
texas
pending
dealing
with
the
obscenity
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
about
15,
i
think
at
last
count
and
i
really
would
like
the
facts
of
any
of
those
other
cases.
i
would
trade
them
for
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
my
purpose
here
is
not
either
to
condemn
the
dallas
police
or
to
really
defend
their
conduct
because
the
order
that’s
appealed
here
is
not
a
civil
rights
type
of
order.
i
mean
a
title
42
situation
where
lawless
conduct
was
alleged
proved
and
found
to
be
present.
this
appeal
comes
because
the
court
below
found
that
the
texas
obscenity
statute
was
unconstitutional.
now,
i
would
like
it
--
just
as
the
beginning
to
comment
on
the
impropriety
of
issuing
the
injunction
here
and
in
lieu
over
into
the
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
a
newspaper
that
was
sold
and
distributed.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
a
charge
was
possession
at
the
time
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
stanley
had
not
been
handed
down
at
that
time
the
texas
statute
afforded
to
cover
both
distribution
and
possession.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
naked
possession
i
will
refer
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor.
but
again
as
i
say,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
statute
was
bound
to
be
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
was
issued
which
difficult
actually
in
this
case
too.
the
problem
with
this
case
are
twofold,
i
think
in
the
area
of
the
cases
that
are
just
been
heard
--
the
three-judge
court
area
their
scope
of
activity.
their
permissible
powers
is
one
of
the
most
complicated,
even
confusing
areas
of
federal
law
and
in
this
case
we
add
to
it
the
complexities
of
the
obscenity
law
and
we
have
a
double
doze,
i
think
of
confusion.
but
in
this
case,
the
final
judgment
referred
granted
the
injunctive
relief
and
against
the
future
enforcements
of
section
1
and
2
of
the
statute.
now,
i'm
not
sure
whether
to
interpret
that
as
enjoining
future
prosecutions
or
continued
enforcement
of
the
then
pending
prosecutions.
if
it's
pending
prosecutions,
of
course
the
anti-injunction
statute
may
or
not
--
may
not
apply
depending
on
how
this
court
rules
and
the
cases
that
is
just
heard.
i
think
if
it
does
enjoin
a
pending
prosecution
the
anti-injunction
applies
and
it's
my
position.
if
it
goes
to
future
prosecutions,
i
think
the
injunction
was
still
not
proper
in
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor
i
think
we
do
have
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
there
is
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
read,
there
has
been
a
good
bid
of
discussion
in
the
proceeding
cases
about
pending
in
future
prosecutions
--
the
propriety
of
enjoining
the
different
types.
and
there
shouldn't
logically
be
any
distinction.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
there
were
two
pending
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
not
sure
your
honor,
with
the
words
in
the
judgment
that
future
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
statute
is
enjoined.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
now
this
to
me
would
connote
that
any
other
steps
to
implement
the
cases
that
were
filed
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
that
it
is
but
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
think
there's
a
--
i
have
never
heard
discussed
this
notion
that
equity
will
not
interfere
the
criminal
case.
we
talked
about
the
anti-injunction
statute,
we
talked
about
abstention
but
we
haven't
talked
before
as
i
have
heard
about
the
classic
notion
the
idea
of
the
doctrine
of
equity
will
not
interfere
to
criminal
case.
and
it
would
certainly
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
reason
for
either
a
federal
or
state
court
do
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
case,
murder,
rape,
robbery,
that
type
of
case.
the
court
would
not
talk
about
abstention;
it
would
talk
about
equity
will
not
intrude
into
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
find
myself
coming
back
and
meeting
myself
in
this
area
but
i
think
i
would
answer
that,
yes,
it
will
not
interfere
in
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
see
no
reason
for
equity
to
add
if
none
is
contemplated
(voice
overlap)
so
maybe
we
won’t
event
get
to
that.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
think
mainly
it
has
been
injunction
(voice
overlap)
they've
asked
equity
authority.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
--
oh!
i'm
sorry
if
the
court
asked
that.
i
have
never
really
understood
why
this
court
has
held
that
declaratory
relief
is
proper
where
no
injunction
is
proper
because
that
is
a
purely
advisory
opinion.
you
say,
uh-huh,
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
but
we're
not
going
to
issue
an
injunction.
now,
the
state
as
i
understood
it
could
just
go
ahead
and
just
prosecute
all
it
wanted
to.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
and
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
really
referring
to
the
three-judge
courts
to
do
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
have
no
trouble
by
now
in
--
i'll
get
to
it
a
minute
with
deciding
that
the
injunction
is
proper
in
this
case
future
or
pending
if
i
just
read
dombrowski
and
cameron
--
cameron
v.
johnson.
but
zwickler
v.
koota
gives
me
some
concern
because
it
seems
that
this
court
was
saying
to
the
three-judge
court
even
though
you
have
found
that
an
injunction
is
not
proper.
you
should
consider
the
declaratory
judgment
aspects
and
this
i
cannot
fit
into
my
thinking
on
the
three-judge
court
scheme.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
as
an
injunction?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
no
sir
if
we're
talking
about
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
court
construing
a
federal
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
as
i
say
unless
it's
a
proper
case
for
an
injunction
the
fact
that
the
court
decides
if
a
statute
is
unconstitutionally
as
advisory
as
witness
the
case
we
just
argued.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
no
sir
i
wouldn't
say
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
justice,
it's
meaningless
in
my
view.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
i
don't
see
that
it
does
anything
else.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
as
i
say
this
is
my
trouble
with
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
have
never
if
there
were
plaintiff
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
i'd
plea
to
declaratory
judgment
act,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
think
2281
and
2284
are
all
that
are
necessary
with
other
jurisdictional
statutes
perhaps.
but
if
i
just
take
dombrowski,
now
as
i
say
the
classic
notion
that
equity
and
abstention
will
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
prosecution
if
you
have
this,
i
think
abstention
has
different
doctrine
and
there
are
probably
three
or
four
different
abstention
doctrines.
but
in
the
free
speech
area
we
do
have
a
different
rule
and
dombrowski
announced
it.
but
then
i
think
if
i
read
cameron
as
it
interprets
dombrowski,
i
have
no
trouble
at
all
in
finding
injunction
in
this
case
was
improper
because
dombrowski
now
was
a
non-pending
prosecution
type
case.
prosecution
was
not
pending
and
in
that
case,
cameron,
as
cameron
interprets
it.
it
says
that
there
will
not
be
federal
interference
unless
the
statute
is
excessively
broad
and
vague
and
where
you
have
the
circumstances
as
you
had
in
dombrowski
where
the
state
courts
have
been
knocking
down
the
search
warrants
returning
evidence.
stopping
the
state
prosecution
and
the
officers
would
continue
to
harass
and
prosecute
on
the
statutes.
now,
if
that
is
what
dombrowski
means
and
that's
the
only
reason
that
a
federal
court
can
issue
an
injunction
--
a
federal
three-judge
court
then
i
am
not
at
all
concerned.
if
you
have
to
have
dombrowski
circumstances
where
you
have
an
excessively
broad
and
vague
statute
on
its
face
and
where
you
have
the
special
harassment
circumstances
then
i
see
no
problem.
now,
in
this
case,
i
don't
like
the
facts
but
there
was
no
--
the
decision
below
is
not
--
does
not
rest
on
harassment.
it
rests
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
but
so
i
say
that
the
injunction
below
regardless
of
whether
that
statute
was
constitutional
or
not
was
improper.
now,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
the
court
below
found
at
this
time
the
texas
statute
define
obscenity
in
the
terms
of
roth.
they
are
not
the
added
elements
that
were
announced
in
memoirs
and
also
suggested
in
jacobellis
and
so
forth.
it
also
purported
to
forbid
mere
possession.
the
section
said
possess
or
sale,
sale
or
distribute,
and
so
forth
and
the
court
said
that
it
will
not
try
to
separate
these
elements
that
because
it
had
possession
in
there
it
was
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutionally
broad
and
vague.
we
think
that
this
is
roth.
the
other
circuits
--
other
three-judge
courts
have
found
the
roth
definition
to
be
acceptable
assuming
that
a
state
trial
judge
will
engraft
the
necessary
constitutional
safeguards
in
any
charge
to
a
jury
and
this
is
what
our
argument
was
below
and
is
here.
the
court
also,
and
of
course
the
court
was
resting
on
stanley
in
this
particular
to
find
that
possession
was
improper
of
the
proscription
against
it
and
that
the
statute
was
impermissibly
vague
because
it
contained
this
element.
we
say
of
course
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
say
not.
now,
the
search
has
occurred
in
late
1968.
this
petition
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
january
i
believe
of
1969.
in
february,
in
one
of
the
state
charges
they
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
and
a
motion
for,
i
forgot
and
this
was
finally
granted
but
long
after
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
the
information.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
were
filed
in
december
i
believe
of
1968.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
and
then
later
they
did
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
i
would
think
there's
any
question
-
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
as
i
said
they
did
in
one
case.
there
are
several
ways
they
can
do
it
under
the
search
warrant
procedures
of
texas.
you
can
raise
the
question
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
did
this
and
this
is
a
practice
that
has
no
statutory
framework
or
foundation
in
texas.
however,
the
courts
are
beginning
to
do
it
to
avoid
situations
like
this.
they're
beginning
to
consider
as
a
matter
of
fact
we've
had
a
state
court
very
recently
declare
that
texas
obscenity
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
hate
to
make
the
admission
i
think
that
court
is
wrong
too.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
our
obscenity
statute,
the
state
court
held
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
--
the
amended
statute?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
it's
not.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
it's
on
the
books
for
this
purpose.
i
would
more
suggest
mootness
because
i
think
one
of
the
dallas
criminal
cases
is
still
pending.
i
think
there
are
some
cases
pending
in
san
antonio
and
elsewhere
around
texas
and
presumably
somebody
has
done
something
very
bad
in
the
field
of
obscenity
before
our
new
statute
was
passed
and
somebody
might
want
to
prosecute
it
for
during
the
periods
of
limitations.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
the
district
court
in
which
(inaudible)
dallas,
texas.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
that
case
is
now
on
appeal
to
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
now,
another
problem
that
the
court
found
below
are
an
assumption
was
the
fact
that
they
said
they
are
on
decide
but
they
assumed
that
there
will
be
a
national
standard
for
the
judging
of
obscenity.
in
this
case,
i
think
this
obscenity
case
presents
most
of
the
problems
in
the
obscenity
field.
the
only
one
it
neglects
and
doesn't
have
in
it
is
this
prior
advisory
hearing
problem
which
has
given
the
court
so
much
trouble
and
i
do
ask
the
court
first
of
all,
i
would
like
i
think
the
injunction
below
is
improper
whether
our
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
i
also
say
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
and
it
could
be
constitutionality
interpreted
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
it's
on
the
ground
that
dombrowski
circumstances
were
not
present
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
either
against
pending
or
future
prosecution.
there
were
no
circumstances
present.
now,
there
may
have
been
circumstances
that
could’ve
been
proved
if
the
court
may
have
relied
on
but
the
court
did
not
in
absent
of
these
circumstances
which
must
form
a
part
of
the
judgment
no
injunction
is
proper
again
as
i
say
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
not.
i
say
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
in
the
way
i'm
asking
this
court
to
hopefully
really
not
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
injunction
aspect.
i
think
we
can
win
that
way,
but
i
would
be
very
hopeful
that
the
court
would
invest
itself
to
obscenity
so
that
there
will
be
a
definition
of
obscenity
that
will
be
approved
out
by
the
majority
of
the
court.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
sir
you
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i'm
getting
off
the
coast
to
it.[laughter]
which
is
everybody
else
has
asked
the
court
not
to
do
but
i
will
say
to
this
court
as
the
final
arbiter
of
law
that
in
the
obscenity
field
as
in
the
three-judge
field,
there's
hopeless
confusion
and
i
think
this
case
presents
the
necessary
points
to
permit
this
court
to
write
on
the
--
in
the
obscenity
area
without
violating
the
purely
advisory
opinion
as
i
say
i'm
getting
off
the
coast
of
it
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true
and
in
this
case
we
do
need
a
definition.
we
need
the
no
what
community,
we
need
to
prove
obscenity
by,
we
need
many
other
points
to
say
or
we'll
be
in
federal
court
forever.
now,
as
a
supervisor
of
the
federal
system,
you
say
we
have
some
15
of
these
cases
in
texas
decision
by
this
court
on
the
obscenity
problems
which
solved
at
least
part
of
the
congestion
there.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
this
is
one
that
i
don't
want
urge
on
the
tort
--[laughter]
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--
but
i
would
say
this
to
you,
your
honor
that
if
a
majority
of
the
court
did
hold
that
way
it
would
solve
a
lot
of
problems
too.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
judge
if
i
have
--
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
had
made
a
crime
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
the
legislative
body
your
honor
mr.
justice
black
and
we
have
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
now
you,
this
court
in
roth
handed
down
a
definition,
told
us
what
we
thought
should
be
(voice
overlap)
our
legislature
gone
together
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
in
a
lot
of
pages
your
honor.
but
we
did
do
the
best
we
could
with
roth.
we
amended
the
statute,
now
we've
come
along
adopted
the
memoirs
test,
and
if
the
court
does
not
have
done
the
view
of
you
and
justice
douglas,
then
we
certainly
need
the
majority
definition
if
they
do
adopt
your
position
well
then
i
guess
we
don’t
need
one.
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
just
a
minute
to
this
exemption
of
newspapers
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not
the
injunction
was
improper.
but
this
exemption
i
think
is
perhaps
unwarranted,
unjustified
but
it
was
the
best
experience
of
the
legislature
at
the
time
they
passed
this
obscenity
statute.
their
experience
was
that
newspapers
do
not
publish
pictures
of
nude
women
and
so
forth
and
they
said
well,
we
will
exempt
the
newspapers
both
daily
and
weekly.
i
don't
know
that
anybody
thought
of
a
newspaper
published
any
other
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
briefs
below
--
i
brief
the
question
fairly
extensively
and
a
newspaper
was
something
that
apparently
is
published
either
daily
or
weekly
according
to
the
common
parlance
but
this
i
think
was
what
the
legislature
knew
of
obscenity
at
the
time
this
was
a
legislative
judgment
that
in
the
newspapers
matters
obscene
did
not
appear.
the
facts
were
discussed
and
i
might
expound
on
my
just
a
moment
on
my
thought
that
if
these
dallas
police
officers
did
engage
in
lawless
conduct,
ignoring
the
statute
or
in
ignoring
proper
constitution
procedures
you
do
not
in
my
judgment
have
a
three-judge
court
case.
you
have
a
civil
rights
case
which
might
be
handled
by
one
judge.
it
would
be
not
be
a
situation
where
you
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
there
are
some
questions
in
my
mind
whether
an
injunction
could
be
issued
in
those
cases
but
certainly
the
remedy
would
be
as
a
civil
rights
complaint
and
i'm
being
harassed,
tormented
by
the
police
officers
who
were
deliberately
setting
out
to
suppress
my
civil
rights.
we
don't
have
this
situation
here.
in
conclusion,
i
again
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
made
in
opinion
for
this
court
on
obscenity.
i
think
my
preference
would
be
if
the
court
wrote
judge
harlan's
view
taken
in
roth
where
he
expressed
the
point
of
view
that
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
legislate
in
this
area
without
regard
to
the
national
standard
saying
that
one
of
the
geniuses
of
the
federal
system
as
we
have
some
48
at
that
time
little
laboratories
where
this
type
of
experimentation
can
go
on
and
he
sees
nothing
that
will
be
detrimental
to
the
contrary
in
permitting
the
state
to
experiment.
and
this
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
perhaps
so.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
might
your
honor
but
i
don’t
know
how
it
could
really.[laughter]
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
of
course.
this
would
be
my
preference
if
not
i
would
like
a
definition
of
obscenity
from
this
court
and
if
you
want
to
include
with
no
redeeming
social
value,
i
think
this
is
properly
defensive
issue
that
the
defendant
could
be
expected
to
prove.
this
was
patently
offensive
and
it
appeals
to
pure
answers
this
should
be
enough
to
initiate
prosecution,
let
the
defendant
then
show
that
there
is
some
redeeming
social
value.
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
up
for
re-argument
only
the
second
time.
we
argued
this
matter
last
spring.
the
facts
as
i
told
the
court
then
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
can
confirm,
i
think
at
least
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
three-judge
federal
courts.
i
think
i
handled
all
for
the
attorney
general's
office,
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
had
two
or
three
pending
at
a
time.
now
we
have
something
like
30
and
no
longer
can
i
do
all
the
three-judge
work.
but,
in
all
of
the
three-judge
court
cases
that
i
have,
i
think
i
would
trade
the
facts
in
anyone
of
the
other
case
for
the
facts
in
this
one
which
is
before
this
court.
this
began
in
dallas,
texas.
it
involved
the
seizure
and
the
filing
of
a
complaint
involving
an
underground
newspaper,
the
dallas
notes.
in
this
situation
the
complaint
for
the
violation
of
the
texas
obscenity
laws
was
filed
and
the
police
under
search
warrant
went
out
and
seized
the
dallas
notes.
they
not
only
got
the
printed
newspapers.
they
picked
up
any
paper
that
was
around
that
could
have
been
use.
they
got
the
furniture,
--
whatever
they
considered
might
have
been
the
tools
or
the
implements
of
the
crime.
as
i
say,
i
would
trade
these
facts
for
almost
any
others.
i
don't
particularly
like
the
facts.
but
in
any
event,
charges
were
filed,
misdemeanor
charges
were
filed
in
the
dallas
courts.
the
defendants
in
those
state
criminal
cases
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court,
asked
that
an
injunction
be
issued
against
the
pending
prosecutions,
against
future
prosecutions,
ask
that
the
texas
obscenity
law
be
declared
unconstitutional.
and
this
was
done
prior
to
anything
really
happening
in
the
state
courts,
i
would
say,
but
i
don't
really
consider
that
that
is
significant
at
least
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
that
three-judge
court
held
the
texas
obscenity
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
statute
in
one
of
its
sections
purportedly
punished
private
possession
of
obscene
materials,
violating
the
injunction
laid
down
by
this
court
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
the
court
refused
to
separate
or
savor
that
part
of
the
statute
out
and
says
that
they
were
not
going
to
make
that
separation.
the
whole
prohibition
section
is
unconstitutional.
they
also
found
that
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
this
texas
statute
was
lacking.
this
statute
was
passed
shortly
after
this
court's
decision
in
roth
and
followed
the
definition
laid
down
to
the
court
in
roth.
the
three-judge
court
below
here
found
that
this
court
had
in
memoirs
and
in
jacobellis
it
lodged
on
or
amplified
or
explained
the
roth
decision
and
that
the
texas
statute
was
fatality
defective
because
it
failed
to
have
the
redeeming
social
value
feature
in
it.
so
for
those
two
reasons,
the
court
below
felt
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
they
did
not
enjoin
the
pending
prosecutions,
but
they
enjoined
all
future
prosecutions
effectively
stopping
any
prosecution
at
least
at
that
time
in
dallas
county.
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
the
dallas
statute
has
been
amended
since
this
decision
and
we
now
have
the
memoirs
type
definition.
we
have
read
out
of
the
statute
a
prohibition
against
private
possession
and
as
best
we
could
try
to
comport
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
in
any
event,
this
was
the
old
statute,
we
did
argue
that
it
was
capable
of
constitutional
interpretation
that
we
didn't
have
to
return
indictments
for
mere
private
possession
and
that
if
no
redeeming
social
value
was
a
part
of
the
test
of
obscenity,
that
this
could
have
been
taken
care
of
by
a
court's
choice
to
the
jury
and
i
think
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
permitted
state
amendment
to
bring
a
state
statute
into
constitutional
interpretation.
several
statutes
in
the
abstinence
(inaudible).
but,
here
we
argue
first
off
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
we
secondly
say
that
no
injunction
should
have
been
issued
against
future
prosecutions.
we
say
that
the
injunctions
should
not
have
issued
because
of
adapting
of
abstention,
the
doctrine
that
equity
will
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
case.
and
we
also
say
that
2283
of
anti-injunction
statute
may
very
well
apply
to
future
prosecutions
that
are
not
pending
as
well
as
two
pending
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
are
still
pending
so
far
as
i
know.
i
called
the
city
attorney's
office
before
coming
up
here.
he
said
he
thought
they
were
pending,
is
that
correct,
one
is
pending,
mr.
richard's.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
one
is
the
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
one
is
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
it
is
still
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'd
hate
to
go
this
far
because
of
the
mootness,
but
of
course,
i
don't
think
even
if
that
prosecution
were
dismissed,
it
would
make
it
moot
as
long
as
we
have
possible
prosecutions
under
the
old
statute
within
the
time
of
limitations.
i
think
the
case
would
still
be
timely
enough.
but
this
2283,
it
was
suggested
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
your
honor,
insofar
as
i
know
in
the
field
of
obscenity,
there
have
been
only
one
or
two
convictions
in
texas,
since
the
massive
attack
has
been
labeled
on
obscenity
laws
within
the
last
couple
of
years.
prosecutors
are
not
sure
what
to
do.
they
don't
know
really
when
they
get
ready
to
try
a
case,
what
kind
of
proof
they
will
need?
do
they
just
submit
the
material
to
the
jury
and
let
the
jury
under
instructions
decide
whether
the
material
is
offensive
and
obscene
as
the
federal
government,
i
understand
is
doing
in
some
of
their
cases
or
do
they
need
expert
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
the
three
prongs,
prurient
interest,
no
redeeming
social
value,
repugnant
to
the
community
as
far
as
matters
of
sexuality
are
concerned.
so
this
concerned
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
again,
i
think
that
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
they
kind
of
hate
to
prosecute
as
long
as
the
federal
district
court
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
now
they
have
made
arrest
recently
in
dallas
under
the
new
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
now,
they
made
some
arrests
in
houston,
texas,
a
number
of
arrests
involving
some
fifth
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
know
about
the
man
selling
popcorn
your
honor,
but
they
did
make
a
number
of
arrests.
they
were
movie
theaters
and
in
those
cases
they
tried
to
comply
with
what
may
be
the
law.
we're
not
sure
yet
on
evidentiary
seizures
opposed
to
a
mass
seizure.
they
did
not
seize
any
movies,
and
they
may
have
got
the
popcorn
man.
i
think
they
had
public
relations
so
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
correct
sir.
there
may
have
been
some
talk
in
the
newspaper
about
that.
i
think
it
did
--
one
or
two
of
the
theaters,
they
did
hold
them
up.
i
was
down
in
houston
at
a
three-judge
court
hearing
on
that
particular
situation.
they
had
not
arrest
the
patrons.
but
there
is
a
houston
ordinance
that
says
if
you
remain
on
the
premises
while
a
lewd
or
obscene
performance
is
going
on,
you
are
also
violating
a
law
and
may
be
picked
up.
i
am
not
--
if
something
has
to
be
found
to
be
unconstitutional
that
seems
to
me
a
good
place
to
start.
i
don't
have
--
i
think
this
is
a
very
problem
matter
of
the
type
of
ordinance
and
i
think
it's
also
bad
relation
to
the
police,
but
i
don't
believe
they
wouldn't
--
the
spectators
would
be
picked
up.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
although
--
except
as
i
have
suggested
--
this
decision
was
on
the
books
and
still
is
on
the
books
as
far
as
the
old
statute
is
concerned.
so,
and
as
i
say
they
--
i'm
sure
they
hesitate
to
prosecute.
now,
i
would
say
there's
another
factor
too,
they're
worried
now
that
they've
gotten
into
the
field
of
obscenity
about
the
case,
they
probably
have
against
dallas
notes.
so
many
things
have
gotten
worse
in
this
area
since
this
arrest
was
made
almost
two
years
ago
that
they
probably
would
be
perfectly
frank,
they
don't
like
the
looks
of
this
case.
they've
got
stag
movies
to
go
after
now
and
this,
the
dallas
notes
was
very
tamed
compared
to
what
is
being
purveyed
today.
probably
poor
answer
but
in
any
event
i
do
say
and
would
like
to
add
to
what
was
said
this
morning
as
to
2283
prohibiting
pending
prosecutions.
i
think
this
is
a
possibility,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
completely
settled
that
in
dombrowski,
of
course
they
had
suggested
there
was
a
difference
between
pending
and
future
prosecutions
but
only
for
the
purposes
of
that
case.
and
i,
like
several
others
before
me
and
it
becomes
kind
of
hard
to
find
something
that
has
not
been
said
before
in
these
cluster
of
cases.
i
do
think
it's
just
as
harmful
to
state
federal
relations
to
enjoin
future
prosecutions
as
if
it
is
pending
prosecutions.
i
think
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
concerned
which
i
have
heard
argued,
i
make
this
suggestion
to
the
court.
i
don't
understand
zwickler
versus
koota.
the
last
time
i
was
here,
i
asked
the
court
to
decide
this
case
not
on
the
basis
of
the
injunction
and
the
impropriety
of
issue
in
itself
of
it,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
obscenity
statute.
at
that
time,
you
told
me
i
was
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion
and
i
had
to
kind
of
nod
my
head
and
smile
sheepishly
and
concede
perhaps
that
was
true
because
if
i
won
as
far
as
the
injunction,
you
might
not
have
to
decide
obscenity
but
i
suggest
to
this
court,
that
anytime
a
federal
court
considers
a
state
statute,
the
constitutionality
of
it
and
does
not
enter
or
issue
an
injunction
but
merely
decides
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
has
rendered
an
advisory
opinion.
it's
decided
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
does
not
issue
an
injunction.
i
say
the
only
reason
that
the
federal
court
should
be
considered
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
injunction
should
issue.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
if
you
do
not
issue,
if
the
federal
court
does
not
issue
an
injunction,
the
federal
--
the
state
court
would
be
--
some
might
say
would
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute.
now,
you
see
in
this
case,
they
did
not
enjoin
the
pending
case
but
they
did
say
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
of
course
this
is
not
an
advisory
opinion
because
they
enjoined
future
prosecutions.
but
if
i
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
no
injunction
then
the
state
would
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute.
now,
perhaps
a
state
defendant
would
then
go
back
in
the
federal
court
and
say,
“look!
now
look
what
they're
doing
to
me.”
and
the
thing
that
worries
me,
the
second
step
is
the
lady
from
new
york
pointed
out.
this
might
make
it
a
three
--
one-judge
court
case,
harassment,
but
i
know
what
else
it
might
make
it,
the
second
time
around,
it
might
make
it
a
dombrowski
type
of
situation.
because
here,
a
court,
a
distinguished
court
of
three
judges
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
no
injunction.
the
state
proceeds
to
prosecute
so
their
argument,
they
could
be
made
coming
in
to
federal
court,
he
has
looked
what
the
state
is
doing,
lawless
behavior,
harassingly,
after
you,
you
the
federal
court
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
dombrowski
type
of
case,
maybe.
you
seem
would
--
and
by
the
way
as
far
as
dombrowski
is
concerned
i'd
defer
a
little
bit
as
far
as
what
the
gentleman
from
new
york
of
the
--
states'
counsel
for
new
york
says,
“i
think
dombrowski
seems
to
indicate
that
you
must
have
a
statute
that's
vague
on
its
face
and
the
special
lawless
type
of
circumstances
before
an
injunction
should
issue
in
the
future
prosecution
type
of
case.”
in
our
case,
i
say
they
are
not
dombrowski
circumstances
and
so
no
pending,
no
--
the
pending
prosecutions
should
not
have
been
enjoined.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon,
future
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
the
court
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
the
court
felt
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
may
have
barred
them
from
enjoining
that
pending
prosecution.
it
also
suggests
that
the
court
felt
that
they
were
not
perhaps
dombrowski
circumstances
except
that
--
i
do
not
know
that
they
suggest
that
very
clearly.
and
the
circumstances
here
were
bad.
i
think,
i
am
not
really
pleased
with
them,
i
would
like
to
hear
some
other
facts
but
i
would
say
that
there
are
no
dombrowski
circumstances
here
because
the
statute
is
not
vague
and
unclear
on
its
face
and
too
broad.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
let
me
see,
justice
douglas,
you
mean
in
the
old
statute,
let's
see
now,
obscene
is
defined
as
whether
to
the
average
--
it
may
not
--
person
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest.
now
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
oh!
there
is
none
in
the
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
believe
there
is
some
of
--
your
honors
have
mentioned
that
in
some
opinions.
i
think
it's
a
problem.
i
think
all
obscenity
statutes
are
problems.
i
think
any
statute
that
seems
to,
that
tries
to
circumscribe
speech
is
a
problem,
although
we
have
argued
initially
in
this
case.
i
believe
it
was
justice
harlan
suggested
in
one
of
the
cases
that
it's
not
--
when
i
really
heard
united
states,
the
difference
is
in
the
enforcement
of
obscenity
laws.
if
the
people
in
texas
can't
read
the
tropic
of
capricorn,
it's
really
not
going
to
make
much
difference
in
the
glory
and
beauty
of
the
federal
system
since
you
50
laboratories
to
apply
these
situations.
and
i
would
suggest
that
really
if
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
of
oklahoma
or
new
york
wants
to
pass
this
statute,
it
says
you
cannot
use
the
word
“damn”
in
any
written
material.
i
really
don't
find
that
particularly
offensive
because
there
are
enough
other
words
to
convey
the
meaning.
if
you
just
want
to
take
out
one
word
like
that
and
now
i
realize
where
we
are
going
to
draw
the
line,
maybe
“darn”
will
be
the
next
word
and
they'd
given
the
next
one
but
nevertheless
we
do
make
the
suggestions
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
states
should
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
wherever
we
have
words
we
do
have
differences
of
opinion
but
i
do
think
that
in
most
statutes
you
have
this
--
you
have
problems,
perhaps
more
in
this
field,
i
think
you're
correct
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
sort
of,
yes
sir.
but
again
you
have
problems
when
you
define
something
into
words
that
you
used
to
define
it,
are
also
subject
to
problems
i
think.
but
we
did
put
no
redeeming
social
value
that
that
is
now
in
our
statute
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
injunction
here
was
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
oh,
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
could
make
a
very
good
argument
why
a
stag
movie
should
be
permitted,
because
entertainment,
saving
on
the
leg,
going
to
baseball
games,
it's
pure
entertainment,
doesn't
really
profit
anybody
anything
but
i
guess
you'd
say
they
have
social
value.
those
that
enjoy
stag
movies,
i
suppose
are
being
entertained
and
in
that
respect
they
have
redeeming
social
value.
i
suppose
taken
to
the
larger
conclusion,
your
views
and
those
of
justice
douglas
might
prevail
as
far
as
obscenity
is
concerned.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
i
do
hope
that
your
views
as
far
as
injunction
justice
black
do
prevail
in
this
case
because
i
do
suggest
the
injunction
was
improperly
issued
and
that
this
case,
the
judgment
below
should
be
vacated.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
may
i
take
the
last
two
minutes
of
this
court's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
(voice
overlap)
only
two
things
i
would
like
to
say,
first,
as
far
as
the
police
activity
in
this
particular
case,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
that.
i'm
not
part
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
have
i
told
the
court
several
times?
but
the
minute
that
this
situation
came
to
the
attention
of
the
city
attorney's
office
in
dallas,
they
no
longer
--
police
can't
get
search
warrants
for
first
amendment
printed
material
without
conferring
with
the
city
attorney's
office.
this
also
precipitated
the
amendment
of
the
obscenity
statute
and
this
was
done
not
after
the
court
decision.
the
wheels
began
to
turn
much
before
this
court
below
held
a
statute
unconstitutional
but
it
does
sometime,
the
police
perhaps
do
not
act
properly
but
i
do
think
when
it
gets
to
thee
district
attorney
or
the
county
attorney,
the
city
attorney,
in
their
office,
the
brakes
can
be
put
on
and
really
i
think
they
can
do
it
pretty
well
without
the
federal
court
intervention.
i
would
say
something
about
this
declaratory
judgment.
apparently
the
plaintiffs
here
or
a
number
of
people
here
are
asking
declaratory
judgment
doctrine
be
extended
to
encompass
just
everything,
one
judge,
declaratory
judgment
can
pass
on
any
state
statute
that
somebody's
worried
about
and
the
ridiculousness
of
this
thing
is
that
we've
had
a
attack
on
sodomy
statute,
a
couple
came
in
and
said,
“we
would
like
to
practice
sodomy
in
the
bedroom
but
this
statute
is
bothering
us,
the
existence
of
it.”
and
that
they
--
that
was
a
case
of
controversy,
there
were
several
other
parties
to
this
but
this
can
--
i
think
show
the
extent
that
this
thing
can
lead
to.
again,
i
suggest
really
and
i
don't
--
i
apologize
to
the
court
in
a
sense
for
saying
this
but
zwickler
versus
koota
which
tells
the
lower
federal
courts
that
they
should
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statutes
even
where
no
injunction
is
proper,
i
think
is
authorizing
advisory
opinions.
thank
you.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
--
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
holding
the
texas
obscenity
statute
unconstitutional.
the
case
arose
in
dallas,
texas
when
the
police
officers
under
search
warrants
seized
--
made
seizures
under
a
search
warrant
of
a
publication
entitled
“dallas
notes.”
it
was
a
newspaper
published
every
two
weeks.
the
officers
had
obtained
an
opinion
of
assistant
district
attorney
that
it
was
obscene.
they
applied
for
a
search
warrant.
they
did
make
a
seizure.
subsequently,
they
went
back
again
and
made
a
seizure
of
the
dallas
notes
and
other
items.
i
think
we
have
about
3
--15,
three-judge
courts
in
texas
pending
dealing
with
the
obscenity
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
about
15,
i
think
at
last
count
and
i
really
would
like
the
facts
of
any
of
those
other
cases.
i
would
trade
them
for
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
my
purpose
here
is
not
either
to
condemn
the
dallas
police
or
to
really
defend
their
conduct
because
the
order
that’s
appealed
here
is
not
a
civil
rights
type
of
order.
i
mean
a
title
42
situation
where
lawless
conduct
was
alleged
proved
and
found
to
be
present.
this
appeal
comes
because
the
court
below
found
that
the
texas
obscenity
statute
was
unconstitutional.
now,
i
would
like
it
--
just
as
the
beginning
to
comment
on
the
impropriety
of
issuing
the
injunction
here
and
in
lieu
over
into
the
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
a
newspaper
that
was
sold
and
distributed.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
a
charge
was
possession
at
the
time
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
stanley
had
not
been
handed
down
at
that
time
the
texas
statute
afforded
to
cover
both
distribution
and
possession.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
naked
possession
i
will
refer
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor.
but
again
as
i
say,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
the
statute
was
bound
to
be
unconstitutional
and
an
injunction
was
issued
which
difficult
actually
in
this
case
too.
the
problem
with
this
case
are
twofold,
i
think
in
the
area
of
the
cases
that
are
just
been
heard
--
the
three-judge
court
area
their
scope
of
activity.
their
permissible
powers
is
one
of
the
most
complicated,
even
confusing
areas
of
federal
law
and
in
this
case
we
add
to
it
the
complexities
of
the
obscenity
law
and
we
have
a
double
doze,
i
think
of
confusion.
but
in
this
case,
the
final
judgment
referred
granted
the
injunctive
relief
and
against
the
future
enforcements
of
section
1
and
2
of
the
statute.
now,
i'm
not
sure
whether
to
interpret
that
as
enjoining
future
prosecutions
or
continued
enforcement
of
the
then
pending
prosecutions.
if
it's
pending
prosecutions,
of
course
the
anti-injunction
statute
may
or
not
--
may
not
apply
depending
on
how
this
court
rules
and
the
cases
that
is
just
heard.
i
think
if
it
does
enjoin
a
pending
prosecution
the
anti-injunction
applies
and
it's
my
position.
if
it
goes
to
future
prosecutions,
i
think
the
injunction
was
still
not
proper
in
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor
i
think
we
do
have
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
there
is
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
read,
there
has
been
a
good
bid
of
discussion
in
the
proceeding
cases
about
pending
in
future
prosecutions
--
the
propriety
of
enjoining
the
different
types.
and
there
shouldn't
logically
be
any
distinction.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
there
were
two
pending
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
not
sure
your
honor,
with
the
words
in
the
judgment
that
future
enforcement
of
the
obscenity
statute
is
enjoined.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
now
this
to
me
would
connote
that
any
other
steps
to
implement
the
cases
that
were
filed
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
that
it
is
but
i'm
not
positive,
but
i
think
there's
a
--
i
have
never
heard
discussed
this
notion
that
equity
will
not
interfere
the
criminal
case.
we
talked
about
the
anti-injunction
statute,
we
talked
about
abstention
but
we
haven't
talked
before
as
i
have
heard
about
the
classic
notion
the
idea
of
the
doctrine
of
equity
will
not
interfere
to
criminal
case.
and
it
would
certainly
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
reason
for
either
a
federal
or
state
court
do
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
case,
murder,
rape,
robbery,
that
type
of
case.
the
court
would
not
talk
about
abstention;
it
would
talk
about
equity
will
not
intrude
into
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
find
myself
coming
back
and
meeting
myself
in
this
area
but
i
think
i
would
answer
that,
yes,
it
will
not
interfere
in
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
see
no
reason
for
equity
to
add
if
none
is
contemplated
(voice
overlap)
so
maybe
we
won’t
event
get
to
that.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
think
mainly
it
has
been
injunction
(voice
overlap)
they've
asked
equity
authority.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
--
oh!
i'm
sorry
if
the
court
asked
that.
i
have
never
really
understood
why
this
court
has
held
that
declaratory
relief
is
proper
where
no
injunction
is
proper
because
that
is
a
purely
advisory
opinion.
you
say,
uh-huh,
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional
but
we're
not
going
to
issue
an
injunction.
now,
the
state
as
i
understood
it
could
just
go
ahead
and
just
prosecute
all
it
wanted
to.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
and
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
really
referring
to
the
three-judge
courts
to
do
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
have
no
trouble
by
now
in
--
i'll
get
to
it
a
minute
with
deciding
that
the
injunction
is
proper
in
this
case
future
or
pending
if
i
just
read
dombrowski
and
cameron
--
cameron
v.
johnson.
but
zwickler
v.
koota
gives
me
some
concern
because
it
seems
that
this
court
was
saying
to
the
three-judge
court
even
though
you
have
found
that
an
injunction
is
not
proper.
you
should
consider
the
declaratory
judgment
aspects
and
this
i
cannot
fit
into
my
thinking
on
the
three-judge
court
scheme.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
as
an
injunction?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
no
sir
if
we're
talking
about
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
court
construing
a
federal
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
as
i
say
unless
it's
a
proper
case
for
an
injunction
the
fact
that
the
court
decides
if
a
statute
is
unconstitutionally
as
advisory
as
witness
the
case
we
just
argued.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
no
sir
i
wouldn't
say
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
justice,
it's
meaningless
in
my
view.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
i
don't
see
that
it
does
anything
else.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
as
i
say
this
is
my
trouble
with
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
have
never
if
there
were
plaintiff
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
i'd
plea
to
declaratory
judgment
act,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
think
2281
and
2284
are
all
that
are
necessary
with
other
jurisdictional
statutes
perhaps.
but
if
i
just
take
dombrowski,
now
as
i
say
the
classic
notion
that
equity
and
abstention
will
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
prosecution
if
you
have
this,
i
think
abstention
has
different
doctrine
and
there
are
probably
three
or
four
different
abstention
doctrines.
but
in
the
free
speech
area
we
do
have
a
different
rule
and
dombrowski
announced
it.
but
then
i
think
if
i
read
cameron
as
it
interprets
dombrowski,
i
have
no
trouble
at
all
in
finding
injunction
in
this
case
was
improper
because
dombrowski
now
was
a
non-pending
prosecution
type
case.
prosecution
was
not
pending
and
in
that
case,
cameron,
as
cameron
interprets
it.
it
says
that
there
will
not
be
federal
interference
unless
the
statute
is
excessively
broad
and
vague
and
where
you
have
the
circumstances
as
you
had
in
dombrowski
where
the
state
courts
have
been
knocking
down
the
search
warrants
returning
evidence.
stopping
the
state
prosecution
and
the
officers
would
continue
to
harass
and
prosecute
on
the
statutes.
now,
if
that
is
what
dombrowski
means
and
that's
the
only
reason
that
a
federal
court
can
issue
an
injunction
--
a
federal
three-judge
court
then
i
am
not
at
all
concerned.
if
you
have
to
have
dombrowski
circumstances
where
you
have
an
excessively
broad
and
vague
statute
on
its
face
and
where
you
have
the
special
harassment
circumstances
then
i
see
no
problem.
now,
in
this
case,
i
don't
like
the
facts
but
there
was
no
--
the
decision
below
is
not
--
does
not
rest
on
harassment.
it
rests
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
but
so
i
say
that
the
injunction
below
regardless
of
whether
that
statute
was
constitutional
or
not
was
improper.
now,
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
the
court
below
found
at
this
time
the
texas
statute
define
obscenity
in
the
terms
of
roth.
they
are
not
the
added
elements
that
were
announced
in
memoirs
and
also
suggested
in
jacobellis
and
so
forth.
it
also
purported
to
forbid
mere
possession.
the
section
said
possess
or
sale,
sale
or
distribute,
and
so
forth
and
the
court
said
that
it
will
not
try
to
separate
these
elements
that
because
it
had
possession
in
there
it
was
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutionally
broad
and
vague.
we
think
that
this
is
roth.
the
other
circuits
--
other
three-judge
courts
have
found
the
roth
definition
to
be
acceptable
assuming
that
a
state
trial
judge
will
engraft
the
necessary
constitutional
safeguards
in
any
charge
to
a
jury
and
this
is
what
our
argument
was
below
and
is
here.
the
court
also,
and
of
course
the
court
was
resting
on
stanley
in
this
particular
to
find
that
possession
was
improper
of
the
proscription
against
it
and
that
the
statute
was
impermissibly
vague
because
it
contained
this
element.
we
say
of
course
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
say
not.
now,
the
search
has
occurred
in
late
1968.
this
petition
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
january
i
believe
of
1969.
in
february,
in
one
of
the
state
charges
they
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
and
a
motion
for,
i
forgot
and
this
was
finally
granted
but
long
after
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
the
information.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
were
filed
in
december
i
believe
of
1968.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
and
then
later
they
did
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that
i
would
think
there's
any
question
-
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
as
i
said
they
did
in
one
case.
there
are
several
ways
they
can
do
it
under
the
search
warrant
procedures
of
texas.
you
can
raise
the
question
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
did
this
and
this
is
a
practice
that
has
no
statutory
framework
or
foundation
in
texas.
however,
the
courts
are
beginning
to
do
it
to
avoid
situations
like
this.
they're
beginning
to
consider
as
a
matter
of
fact
we've
had
a
state
court
very
recently
declare
that
texas
obscenity
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
hate
to
make
the
admission
i
think
that
court
is
wrong
too.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
our
obscenity
statute,
the
state
court
held
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
--
the
amended
statute?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
it's
not.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
it's
on
the
books
for
this
purpose.
i
would
more
suggest
mootness
because
i
think
one
of
the
dallas
criminal
cases
is
still
pending.
i
think
there
are
some
cases
pending
in
san
antonio
and
elsewhere
around
texas
and
presumably
somebody
has
done
something
very
bad
in
the
field
of
obscenity
before
our
new
statute
was
passed
and
somebody
might
want
to
prosecute
it
for
during
the
periods
of
limitations.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
was
the
district
court
in
which
(inaudible)
dallas,
texas.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
that
case
is
now
on
appeal
to
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
now,
another
problem
that
the
court
found
below
are
an
assumption
was
the
fact
that
they
said
they
are
on
decide
but
they
assumed
that
there
will
be
a
national
standard
for
the
judging
of
obscenity.
in
this
case,
i
think
this
obscenity
case
presents
most
of
the
problems
in
the
obscenity
field.
the
only
one
it
neglects
and
doesn't
have
in
it
is
this
prior
advisory
hearing
problem
which
has
given
the
court
so
much
trouble
and
i
do
ask
the
court
first
of
all,
i
would
like
i
think
the
injunction
below
is
improper
whether
our
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
i
also
say
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
and
it
could
be
constitutionality
interpreted
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
it's
on
the
ground
that
dombrowski
circumstances
were
not
present
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
either
against
pending
or
future
prosecution.
there
were
no
circumstances
present.
now,
there
may
have
been
circumstances
that
could’ve
been
proved
if
the
court
may
have
relied
on
but
the
court
did
not
in
absent
of
these
circumstances
which
must
form
a
part
of
the
judgment
no
injunction
is
proper
again
as
i
say
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
not.
i
say
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
in
the
way
i'm
asking
this
court
to
hopefully
really
not
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
injunction
aspect.
i
think
we
can
win
that
way,
but
i
would
be
very
hopeful
that
the
court
would
invest
itself
to
obscenity
so
that
there
will
be
a
definition
of
obscenity
that
will
be
approved
out
by
the
majority
of
the
court.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
sir
you
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i'm
getting
off
the
coast
to
it.[laughter]
which
is
everybody
else
has
asked
the
court
not
to
do
but
i
will
say
to
this
court
as
the
final
arbiter
of
law
that
in
the
obscenity
field
as
in
the
three-judge
field,
there's
hopeless
confusion
and
i
think
this
case
presents
the
necessary
points
to
permit
this
court
to
write
on
the
--
in
the
obscenity
area
without
violating
the
purely
advisory
opinion
as
i
say
i'm
getting
off
the
coast
of
it
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true
and
in
this
case
we
do
need
a
definition.
we
need
the
no
what
community,
we
need
to
prove
obscenity
by,
we
need
many
other
points
to
say
or
we'll
be
in
federal
court
forever.
now,
as
a
supervisor
of
the
federal
system,
you
say
we
have
some
15
of
these
cases
in
texas
decision
by
this
court
on
the
obscenity
problems
which
solved
at
least
part
of
the
congestion
there.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
this
is
one
that
i
don't
want
urge
on
the
tort
--[laughter]
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--
but
i
would
say
this
to
you,
your
honor
that
if
a
majority
of
the
court
did
hold
that
way
it
would
solve
a
lot
of
problems
too.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
judge
if
i
have
--
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
had
made
a
crime
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
the
legislative
body
your
honor
mr.
justice
black
and
we
have
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
now
you,
this
court
in
roth
handed
down
a
definition,
told
us
what
we
thought
should
be
(voice
overlap)
our
legislature
gone
together
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
in
a
lot
of
pages
your
honor.
but
we
did
do
the
best
we
could
with
roth.
we
amended
the
statute,
now
we've
come
along
adopted
the
memoirs
test,
and
if
the
court
does
not
have
done
the
view
of
you
and
justice
douglas,
then
we
certainly
need
the
majority
definition
if
they
do
adopt
your
position
well
then
i
guess
we
don’t
need
one.
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
just
a
minute
to
this
exemption
of
newspapers
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not
the
injunction
was
improper.
but
this
exemption
i
think
is
perhaps
unwarranted,
unjustified
but
it
was
the
best
experience
of
the
legislature
at
the
time
they
passed
this
obscenity
statute.
their
experience
was
that
newspapers
do
not
publish
pictures
of
nude
women
and
so
forth
and
they
said
well,
we
will
exempt
the
newspapers
both
daily
and
weekly.
i
don't
know
that
anybody
thought
of
a
newspaper
published
any
other
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
briefs
below
--
i
brief
the
question
fairly
extensively
and
a
newspaper
was
something
that
apparently
is
published
either
daily
or
weekly
according
to
the
common
parlance
but
this
i
think
was
what
the
legislature
knew
of
obscenity
at
the
time
this
was
a
legislative
judgment
that
in
the
newspapers
matters
obscene
did
not
appear.
the
facts
were
discussed
and
i
might
expound
on
my
just
a
moment
on
my
thought
that
if
these
dallas
police
officers
did
engage
in
lawless
conduct,
ignoring
the
statute
or
in
ignoring
proper
constitution
procedures
you
do
not
in
my
judgment
have
a
three-judge
court
case.
you
have
a
civil
rights
case
which
might
be
handled
by
one
judge.
it
would
be
not
be
a
situation
where
you
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
there
are
some
questions
in
my
mind
whether
an
injunction
could
be
issued
in
those
cases
but
certainly
the
remedy
would
be
as
a
civil
rights
complaint
and
i'm
being
harassed,
tormented
by
the
police
officers
who
were
deliberately
setting
out
to
suppress
my
civil
rights.
we
don't
have
this
situation
here.
in
conclusion,
i
again
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
made
in
opinion
for
this
court
on
obscenity.
i
think
my
preference
would
be
if
the
court
wrote
judge
harlan's
view
taken
in
roth
where
he
expressed
the
point
of
view
that
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
legislate
in
this
area
without
regard
to
the
national
standard
saying
that
one
of
the
geniuses
of
the
federal
system
as
we
have
some
48
at
that
time
little
laboratories
where
this
type
of
experimentation
can
go
on
and
he
sees
nothing
that
will
be
detrimental
to
the
contrary
in
permitting
the
state
to
experiment.
and
this
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
perhaps
so.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
it
might
your
honor
but
i
don’t
know
how
it
could
really.[laughter]
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
of
course.
this
would
be
my
preference
if
not
i
would
like
a
definition
of
obscenity
from
this
court
and
if
you
want
to
include
with
no
redeeming
social
value,
i
think
this
is
properly
defensive
issue
that
the
defendant
could
be
expected
to
prove.
this
was
patently
offensive
and
it
appeals
to
pure
answers
this
should
be
enough
to
initiate
prosecution,
let
the
defendant
then
show
that
there
is
some
redeeming
social
value.
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
up
for
re-argument
only
the
second
time.
we
argued
this
matter
last
spring.
the
facts
as
i
told
the
court
then
and
mr.
chief
justice
i
can
confirm,
i
think
at
least
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
three-judge
federal
courts.
i
think
i
handled
all
for
the
attorney
general's
office,
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
had
two
or
three
pending
at
a
time.
now
we
have
something
like
30
and
no
longer
can
i
do
all
the
three-judge
work.
but,
in
all
of
the
three-judge
court
cases
that
i
have,
i
think
i
would
trade
the
facts
in
anyone
of
the
other
case
for
the
facts
in
this
one
which
is
before
this
court.
this
began
in
dallas,
texas.
it
involved
the
seizure
and
the
filing
of
a
complaint
involving
an
underground
newspaper,
the
dallas
notes.
in
this
situation
the
complaint
for
the
violation
of
the
texas
obscenity
laws
was
filed
and
the
police
under
search
warrant
went
out
and
seized
the
dallas
notes.
they
not
only
got
the
printed
newspapers.
they
picked
up
any
paper
that
was
around
that
could
have
been
use.
they
got
the
furniture,
--
whatever
they
considered
might
have
been
the
tools
or
the
implements
of
the
crime.
as
i
say,
i
would
trade
these
facts
for
almost
any
others.
i
don't
particularly
like
the
facts.
but
in
any
event,
charges
were
filed,
misdemeanor
charges
were
filed
in
the
dallas
courts.
the
defendants
in
those
state
criminal
cases
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court,
asked
that
an
injunction
be
issued
against
the
pending
prosecutions,
against
future
prosecutions,
ask
that
the
texas
obscenity
law
be
declared
unconstitutional.
and
this
was
done
prior
to
anything
really
happening
in
the
state
courts,
i
would
say,
but
i
don't
really
consider
that
that
is
significant
at
least
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
that
three-judge
court
held
the
texas
obscenity
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
statute
in
one
of
its
sections
purportedly
punished
private
possession
of
obscene
materials,
violating
the
injunction
laid
down
by
this
court
in
stanley
versus
georgia.
the
court
refused
to
separate
or
savor
that
part
of
the
statute
out
and
says
that
they
were
not
going
to
make
that
separation.
the
whole
prohibition
section
is
unconstitutional.
they
also
found
that
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
this
texas
statute
was
lacking.
this
statute
was
passed
shortly
after
this
court's
decision
in
roth
and
followed
the
definition
laid
down
to
the
court
in
roth.
the
three-judge
court
below
here
found
that
this
court
had
in
memoirs
and
in
jacobellis
it
lodged
on
or
amplified
or
explained
the
roth
decision
and
that
the
texas
statute
was
fatality
defective
because
it
failed
to
have
the
redeeming
social
value
feature
in
it.
so
for
those
two
reasons,
the
court
below
felt
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
they
did
not
enjoin
the
pending
prosecutions,
but
they
enjoined
all
future
prosecutions
effectively
stopping
any
prosecution
at
least
at
that
time
in
dallas
county.
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
the
dallas
statute
has
been
amended
since
this
decision
and
we
now
have
the
memoirs
type
definition.
we
have
read
out
of
the
statute
a
prohibition
against
private
possession
and
as
best
we
could
try
to
comport
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
in
any
event,
this
was
the
old
statute,
we
did
argue
that
it
was
capable
of
constitutional
interpretation
that
we
didn't
have
to
return
indictments
for
mere
private
possession
and
that
if
no
redeeming
social
value
was
a
part
of
the
test
of
obscenity,
that
this
could
have
been
taken
care
of
by
a
court's
choice
to
the
jury
and
i
think
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
permitted
state
amendment
to
bring
a
state
statute
into
constitutional
interpretation.
several
statutes
in
the
abstinence
(inaudible).
but,
here
we
argue
first
off
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
we
secondly
say
that
no
injunction
should
have
been
issued
against
future
prosecutions.
we
say
that
the
injunctions
should
not
have
issued
because
of
adapting
of
abstention,
the
doctrine
that
equity
will
not
interfere
in
a
criminal
case.
and
we
also
say
that
2283
of
anti-injunction
statute
may
very
well
apply
to
future
prosecutions
that
are
not
pending
as
well
as
two
pending
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
they
are
still
pending
so
far
as
i
know.
i
called
the
city
attorney's
office
before
coming
up
here.
he
said
he
thought
they
were
pending,
is
that
correct,
one
is
pending,
mr.
richard's.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
one
is
the
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
one
is
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
it
is
still
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'd
hate
to
go
this
far
because
of
the
mootness,
but
of
course,
i
don't
think
even
if
that
prosecution
were
dismissed,
it
would
make
it
moot
as
long
as
we
have
possible
prosecutions
under
the
old
statute
within
the
time
of
limitations.
i
think
the
case
would
still
be
timely
enough.
but
this
2283,
it
was
suggested
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
your
honor,
insofar
as
i
know
in
the
field
of
obscenity,
there
have
been
only
one
or
two
convictions
in
texas,
since
the
massive
attack
has
been
labeled
on
obscenity
laws
within
the
last
couple
of
years.
prosecutors
are
not
sure
what
to
do.
they
don't
know
really
when
they
get
ready
to
try
a
case,
what
kind
of
proof
they
will
need?
do
they
just
submit
the
material
to
the
jury
and
let
the
jury
under
instructions
decide
whether
the
material
is
offensive
and
obscene
as
the
federal
government,
i
understand
is
doing
in
some
of
their
cases
or
do
they
need
expert
witnesses
to
testify
as
to
the
three
prongs,
prurient
interest,
no
redeeming
social
value,
repugnant
to
the
community
as
far
as
matters
of
sexuality
are
concerned.
so
this
concerned
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
again,
i
think
that
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
they
kind
of
hate
to
prosecute
as
long
as
the
federal
district
court
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
now
they
have
made
arrest
recently
in
dallas
under
the
new
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
now,
they
made
some
arrests
in
houston,
texas,
a
number
of
arrests
involving
some
fifth
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
know
about
the
man
selling
popcorn
your
honor,
but
they
did
make
a
number
of
arrests.
they
were
movie
theaters
and
in
those
cases
they
tried
to
comply
with
what
may
be
the
law.
we're
not
sure
yet
on
evidentiary
seizures
opposed
to
a
mass
seizure.
they
did
not
seize
any
movies,
and
they
may
have
got
the
popcorn
man.
i
think
they
had
public
relations
so
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned
but
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
correct
sir.
there
may
have
been
some
talk
in
the
newspaper
about
that.
i
think
it
did
--
one
or
two
of
the
theaters,
they
did
hold
them
up.
i
was
down
in
houston
at
a
three-judge
court
hearing
on
that
particular
situation.
they
had
not
arrest
the
patrons.
but
there
is
a
houston
ordinance
that
says
if
you
remain
on
the
premises
while
a
lewd
or
obscene
performance
is
going
on,
you
are
also
violating
a
law
and
may
be
picked
up.
i
am
not
--
if
something
has
to
be
found
to
be
unconstitutional
that
seems
to
me
a
good
place
to
start.
i
don't
have
--
i
think
this
is
a
very
problem
matter
of
the
type
of
ordinance
and
i
think
it's
also
bad
relation
to
the
police,
but
i
don't
believe
they
wouldn't
--
the
spectators
would
be
picked
up.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
although
--
except
as
i
have
suggested
--
this
decision
was
on
the
books
and
still
is
on
the
books
as
far
as
the
old
statute
is
concerned.
so,
and
as
i
say
they
--
i'm
sure
they
hesitate
to
prosecute.
now,
i
would
say
there's
another
factor
too,
they're
worried
now
that
they've
gotten
into
the
field
of
obscenity
about
the
case,
they
probably
have
against
dallas
notes.
so
many
things
have
gotten
worse
in
this
area
since
this
arrest
was
made
almost
two
years
ago
that
they
probably
would
be
perfectly
frank,
they
don't
like
the
looks
of
this
case.
they've
got
stag
movies
to
go
after
now
and
this,
the
dallas
notes
was
very
tamed
compared
to
what
is
being
purveyed
today.
probably
poor
answer
but
in
any
event
i
do
say
and
would
like
to
add
to
what
was
said
this
morning
as
to
2283
prohibiting
pending
prosecutions.
i
think
this
is
a
possibility,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
completely
settled
that
in
dombrowski,
of
course
they
had
suggested
there
was
a
difference
between
pending
and
future
prosecutions
but
only
for
the
purposes
of
that
case.
and
i,
like
several
others
before
me
and
it
becomes
kind
of
hard
to
find
something
that
has
not
been
said
before
in
these
cluster
of
cases.
i
do
think
it's
just
as
harmful
to
state
federal
relations
to
enjoin
future
prosecutions
as
if
it
is
pending
prosecutions.
i
think
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
concerned
which
i
have
heard
argued,
i
make
this
suggestion
to
the
court.
i
don't
understand
zwickler
versus
koota.
the
last
time
i
was
here,
i
asked
the
court
to
decide
this
case
not
on
the
basis
of
the
injunction
and
the
impropriety
of
issue
in
itself
of
it,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
obscenity
statute.
at
that
time,
you
told
me
i
was
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion
and
i
had
to
kind
of
nod
my
head
and
smile
sheepishly
and
concede
perhaps
that
was
true
because
if
i
won
as
far
as
the
injunction,
you
might
not
have
to
decide
obscenity
but
i
suggest
to
this
court,
that
anytime
a
federal
court
considers
a
state
statute,
the
constitutionality
of
it
and
does
not
enter
or
issue
an
injunction
but
merely
decides
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
has
rendered
an
advisory
opinion.
it's
decided
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
does
not
issue
an
injunction.
i
say
the
only
reason
that
the
federal
court
should
be
considered
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
injunction
should
issue.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
if
you
do
not
issue,
if
the
federal
court
does
not
issue
an
injunction,
the
federal
--
the
state
court
would
be
--
some
might
say
would
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute.
now,
you
see
in
this
case,
they
did
not
enjoin
the
pending
case
but
they
did
say
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
of
course
this
is
not
an
advisory
opinion
because
they
enjoined
future
prosecutions.
but
if
i
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
no
injunction
then
the
state
would
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute.
now,
perhaps
a
state
defendant
would
then
go
back
in
the
federal
court
and
say,
“look!
now
look
what
they're
doing
to
me.”
and
the
thing
that
worries
me,
the
second
step
is
the
lady
from
new
york
pointed
out.
this
might
make
it
a
three
--
one-judge
court
case,
harassment,
but
i
know
what
else
it
might
make
it,
the
second
time
around,
it
might
make
it
a
dombrowski
type
of
situation.
because
here,
a
court,
a
distinguished
court
of
three
judges
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
no
injunction.
the
state
proceeds
to
prosecute
so
their
argument,
they
could
be
made
coming
in
to
federal
court,
he
has
looked
what
the
state
is
doing,
lawless
behavior,
harassingly,
after
you,
you
the
federal
court
has
said
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
dombrowski
type
of
case,
maybe.
you
seem
would
--
and
by
the
way
as
far
as
dombrowski
is
concerned
i'd
defer
a
little
bit
as
far
as
what
the
gentleman
from
new
york
of
the
--
states'
counsel
for
new
york
says,
“i
think
dombrowski
seems
to
indicate
that
you
must
have
a
statute
that's
vague
on
its
face
and
the
special
lawless
type
of
circumstances
before
an
injunction
should
issue
in
the
future
prosecution
type
of
case.”
in
our
case,
i
say
they
are
not
dombrowski
circumstances
and
so
no
pending,
no
--
the
pending
prosecutions
should
not
have
been
enjoined.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon,
future
prosecutions.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
the
court
i
think
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
the
court
felt
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
may
have
barred
them
from
enjoining
that
pending
prosecution.
it
also
suggests
that
the
court
felt
that
they
were
not
perhaps
dombrowski
circumstances
except
that
--
i
do
not
know
that
they
suggest
that
very
clearly.
and
the
circumstances
here
were
bad.
i
think,
i
am
not
really
pleased
with
them,
i
would
like
to
hear
some
other
facts
but
i
would
say
that
there
are
no
dombrowski
circumstances
here
because
the
statute
is
not
vague
and
unclear
on
its
face
and
too
broad.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
let
me
see,
justice
douglas,
you
mean
in
the
old
statute,
let's
see
now,
obscene
is
defined
as
whether
to
the
average
--
it
may
not
--
person
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
material
taken
as
a
whole
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest.
now
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
oh!
there
is
none
in
the
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
believe
there
is
some
of
--
your
honors
have
mentioned
that
in
some
opinions.
i
think
it's
a
problem.
i
think
all
obscenity
statutes
are
problems.
i
think
any
statute
that
seems
to,
that
tries
to
circumscribe
speech
is
a
problem,
although
we
have
argued
initially
in
this
case.
i
believe
it
was
justice
harlan
suggested
in
one
of
the
cases
that
it's
not
--
when
i
really
heard
united
states,
the
difference
is
in
the
enforcement
of
obscenity
laws.
if
the
people
in
texas
can't
read
the
tropic
of
capricorn,
it's
really
not
going
to
make
much
difference
in
the
glory
and
beauty
of
the
federal
system
since
you
50
laboratories
to
apply
these
situations.
and
i
would
suggest
that
really
if
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
of
oklahoma
or
new
york
wants
to
pass
this
statute,
it
says
you
cannot
use
the
word
“damn”
in
any
written
material.
i
really
don't
find
that
particularly
offensive
because
there
are
enough
other
words
to
convey
the
meaning.
if
you
just
want
to
take
out
one
word
like
that
and
now
i
realize
where
we
are
going
to
draw
the
line,
maybe
“darn”
will
be
the
next
word
and
they'd
given
the
next
one
but
nevertheless
we
do
make
the
suggestions
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
states
should
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
think
wherever
we
have
words
we
do
have
differences
of
opinion
but
i
do
think
that
in
most
statutes
you
have
this
--
you
have
problems,
perhaps
more
in
this
field,
i
think
you're
correct
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
sort
of,
yes
sir.
but
again
you
have
problems
when
you
define
something
into
words
that
you
used
to
define
it,
are
also
subject
to
problems
i
think.
but
we
did
put
no
redeeming
social
value
that
that
is
now
in
our
statute
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
injunction
here
was
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
oh,
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
could
make
a
very
good
argument
why
a
stag
movie
should
be
permitted,
because
entertainment,
saving
on
the
leg,
going
to
baseball
games,
it's
pure
entertainment,
doesn't
really
profit
anybody
anything
but
i
guess
you'd
say
they
have
social
value.
those
that
enjoy
stag
movies,
i
suppose
are
being
entertained
and
in
that
respect
they
have
redeeming
social
value.
i
suppose
taken
to
the
larger
conclusion,
your
views
and
those
of
justice
douglas
might
prevail
as
far
as
obscenity
is
concerned.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
but
i
do
hope
that
your
views
as
far
as
injunction
justice
black
do
prevail
in
this
case
because
i
do
suggest
the
injunction
was
improperly
issued
and
that
this
case,
the
judgment
below
should
be
vacated.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
may
i
take
the
last
two
minutes
of
this
court's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
(voice
overlap)
only
two
things
i
would
like
to
say,
first,
as
far
as
the
police
activity
in
this
particular
case,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
that.
i'm
not
part
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
have
i
told
the
court
several
times?
but
the
minute
that
this
situation
came
to
the
attention
of
the
city
attorney's
office
in
dallas,
they
no
longer
--
police
can't
get
search
warrants
for
first
amendment
printed
material
without
conferring
with
the
city
attorney's
office.
this
also
precipitated
the
amendment
of
the
obscenity
statute
and
this
was
done
not
after
the
court
decision.
the
wheels
began
to
turn
much
before
this
court
below
held
a
statute
unconstitutional
but
it
does
sometime,
the
police
perhaps
do
not
act
properly
but
i
do
think
when
it
gets
to
thee
district
attorney
or
the
county
attorney,
the
city
attorney,
in
their
office,
the
brakes
can
be
put
on
and
really
i
think
they
can
do
it
pretty
well
without
the
federal
court
intervention.
i
would
say
something
about
this
declaratory
judgment.
apparently
the
plaintiffs
here
or
a
number
of
people
here
are
asking
declaratory
judgment
doctrine
be
extended
to
encompass
just
everything,
one
judge,
declaratory
judgment
can
pass
on
any
state
statute
that
somebody's
worried
about
and
the
ridiculousness
of
this
thing
is
that
we've
had
a
attack
on
sodomy
statute,
a
couple
came
in
and
said,
“we
would
like
to
practice
sodomy
in
the
bedroom
but
this
statute
is
bothering
us,
the
existence
of
it.”
and
that
they
--
that
was
a
case
of
controversy,
there
were
several
other
parties
to
this
but
this
can
--
i
think
show
the
extent
that
this
thing
can
lead
to.
again,
i
suggest
really
and
i
don't
--
i
apologize
to
the
court
in
a
sense
for
saying
this
but
zwickler
versus
koota
which
tells
the
lower
federal
courts
that
they
should
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statutes
even
where
no
injunction
is
proper,
i
think
is
authorizing
advisory
opinions.
thank
you.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
--
sir?
