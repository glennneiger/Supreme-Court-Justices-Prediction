when

or
(inaudible)?

an

justice
william
o.
douglas
and
they
were
filed
when
in
relation
to
the
time
you
have
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see
and
then
it's
a
month
later
the
suit
was
brought
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
i
want
to
try
get
i
want
to
be
sure
that
there's
no
question
that
the
criminal
prosecutions
have
actually
been
initiated
before
this
actual
broad.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
held
unconstitutional?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
did
you
say
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
--
which
of
your
state
courts
held
the
amended
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
depends
on
whose
ox
is
gored.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
depends
on
whose
ox
is
gored.[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
if
you
took
the
view
of
justice
black
and
myself,
you
have
no
problem
because
--[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
is
that,
a
prurient,
it
was
defined?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
i've
read
that,
i
just
wondered
what
the
definition
of
prurient
is.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that
is
clear
enough?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
have
heard
people
say
that
it
could
tell
it
when
they
saw
it
but
they
couldn't
describe
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
question
really
went
to
your
observation
that
this
statute
was
clear
of
ambiguities.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
if
the
statute
to
start
off
the
--
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
the
case
is
no
different
from
it
would
be
if
the
new
york
times
was
being
taken
over
by
investigators
and
the
police
and
press
this
clause
to
whatnot,
could
be
a
form
of
censorship
i
suppose
like
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
near
versus
minnesota,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
not
the
whole
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
you
have
a
different
question,
i
suppose?
