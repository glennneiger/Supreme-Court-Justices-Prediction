mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
clarify
if
i
may
at
the
outset
one
matter
very
clearly
there
is
no
injunction
here
against
the
pending
prosecution
that
ironically
i
have
sought
only
declaratory
relief
below.
the
issue
was
raised
where
that
required
the
three-judge
panel
and
in
accordance
with
the
present
practice
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
three-judge
panel
was
designated
to
decide
that
threshold
question
at
the
necessity
of
panel.
at
that
point,
i
amended
my
pleadings.
it
appeared
at
page
77
and
reinserted
the
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
with
the
exception
of
presently
pending
causes.
an
assumption
of
that
point
being
since
they
have
three-judge
is
coming
they
might
as
well
clarify
their
jurisdiction.
the
court's
opinion
at
page
81
characterizes
our
prayer
as
one
for
injunction
with
the
exception
of
presently
pending
causes.
and
i
would
assume
in
this
background
in
the
clear
interpretation
of
the
order
is
that
the
injunctive
order
runs
only
against
future
enforcement
of
the
statute
as
to
the
plaintiff
and
does
not
inhibit
the
processing
of
the
presently
pending
causes.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
sedulously
attempted
to
avoid
it
and
i
think
i
hope
i
successfully
avoided
2283
problem.
frankly,
we
do
not
think
we
even
have
to
turn
to
dombrowski
for
our
authority
but
we
can
go
back
to
1923
in
justice
butler’s
opinion
in
terrace
versus
thompson
which
i
think
quite
clearly
speaks
to
the
right
of
a
litigant
to
go
to
the
federal
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relied
against
the
enforcement
of
the
state’s
statute
which
impinges
upon
his
--
and
that
is
its
property
rights
but
the
opinion
broadly
addressed
itself
to
individual
freedoms.
mr.
david
r.
richards
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
david
r.
richards
terrace
versus
thompson,
263
u.s.
197.
equity
jurisdiction
will
be
exercised
to
enjoin
the
threat
enforcement
of
the
state
law
which
contravenes
a
federal
constitution
wherever
it
is
essential
in
order
effectuate
and
protect
property
rights
or
rights
of
persons
against
injuries
otherwise
irremediable.
we
think
that
the
past
sphere
show
just
that
kind
of
irremediable
injury
or
potential
injury.
the
plaintiff
is
a
young
man
publishing
an
underground
newspaper
in
the
city
of
dallas,
texas
grant
a
file
with
the
dallas
police.
as
the
head
of
the
vice
squad
admitted
on
his
deposition
the
police
became
concerned
about
the
newspaper
in
general
and
decide
to
go
to
district
attorney
and
show
him
copy
of
it.
now,
we
were
unable
to
reprint
the
copy
in
the
appendix,
it
is
a
part
of
the
record.
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
obscene
under
any
standard
extent.
the
district
attorney
o'brian
didn’t
look
obscene
to
him
so
the
dallas
police
didn't
get
their
search
warrant
there
in
afternoon
they
waited
until
night
without
the
(inaudible)
and
got
justice
otis
to
issue
a
warrant
to
seize
obscene
matter.
they
didn't
show
the
justice
otis
the
newspaper
upon
which
they
relied
to
obtain
their
warrant.
they
arrived
at
mr.
stein's
residence
about
10
at
night,
conducted
with
two
trucks,
a
dozen
police
officers
and
trustees
seized
by
their
own
admission
two
tons
of
newspaper,
periodicals,
typewriters
and
cameras,
money,
a
brown
sweater
even,
effectively
putting
mr.
stein
out
of
business
they
thought
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
was
one
of
the
items
they
seized
with
no
explanation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
they
treated
everything
--[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
everything
they
found
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
as
their
explanation
for
the
seizure
of
the
tables
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
was
apparently
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
police
officer
when
asked
of
on
deposition
why
he
had
seized
a
poster
of
mao
tse-tung
off
the
wall
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
can't
pronounce
the
name
properly,
mao
tse-tung,
the
premier
of
communist
china.
they
took
that
poster
off
the
wall
and
i
asked
why
was
it
seized
that
particular
item.
and
they
said,
we
did
not
know
what
to
take
and
what
not
to
take
so
simply
took
everything.
now,
that
was
on
october
30.
mr.
david
r.
richards
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
seems
to
me
as
the
factual
context
in
which
an
injunction
is
issued.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
say
if
i
may
your
honor
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it's
not,
it's
before
you
it
seems
to
me
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
was
relied
upon
by
the
dallas
police
who
felt
that
the
statute
gave
them
the
authority
to
make
on
the
spot
determination
as
to
the
obscenity
of
any
given
material
and
confiscate
that
material.
now,
that's
how
they
view
the
statute.
mr.
david
r.
richards
quite
right.
that's
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
understand,
maybe
i
do
but
let
me
at
least
say
that
at
least
in
colloquy
with
prior
counsel
and
in
earlier
cases
argued
about
yesterday
and
today,
i
sense
a
certain
feeling
upon
the
court
that
injunction
should
not
be
issued
except
in
somewhat
--
in
circumstances
which
demonstrated
a
continuity
perhaps
or
threat
of
continuing
violations
that
concern
that
first
amendment
rights
may
be
over
burden
by
a
pattern
of
conduct.
i
think
the
two
searches
and
seizures
here
do
reflect
the
kind
of
pattern,
the
kind
of
context
in
which
injunctive
relief
is
certainly
addresses
itself
to
lower
court's
discretion.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
did
not
seek
to
enjoin
of
any
prosecution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
make
myself
--
i
considered
that
the
injunctive
relief
i
sought
in
the
injunctive
relief
that
i
obtained
run
to
all
defendants
and
that
includes
the
dallas
police,
that
frankly
it
was
not
the
pending
prosecutions
that
represented
the
threat.
it
was
the
repeated
searches
and
seizures
pursuant
to
the
obscenity
statute
which
we
felt
assure
it
was
going
to
assure
that
demise
of
the
newspaper
if
they
persisted.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
if
i
may
say
at
that
time
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
was
the
highest
appellate
court
of
texas
with
respect
to
criminal
matters
had
addressed
itself
to
the
two
fundamental
issues
upon
which
i
have
attacked
the
statute
and
upheld
it.
one,
they
had
in
sullivan
versus
state
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
upheld
the
statute
in
so
far
as
it
made
criminal
simple
possession
of
obscene
matter.
so
i
assume
that
the
lower
court
of
texas
would
consider
themselves
bound
by
that
determination.
the
second
attack
i
made
on
the
statute
was
that
--
one
more
i
guess
the
protection
of
attack
that
the
exemption
the
statute
gave
to
daily
and
weekly
newspaper
was
rendered
in
unconstitutional
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
still
have
the
question
occurs
whether
that
--
yes
i
have
a
way
of
attacking,
they
could
go
on
trial
and
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
take
it
that
at
that
stage
i
--
the
remedy
i
would
assume
would
be
one
of
appeal
from
the
lower
court
condition.
mr.
david
r.
richards
my
excuse
if
i'm
required
to
have
one
is
that
i'm
dealing
here
with
the
publisher
of
newspaper
who’s
being
subjected
to
repeated
harassment
by
the
dallas
police
pursuant
to
this
statute
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
i
may
say
we
do
elude
in
our
brief
since
it’s
not
of
record.
we
filed
and
presented
and
argued
at
some
link
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
state
court
and
one
case
in
february
of
1969
and
its
finding
on
october
of
1969
that
the
state
court
did
grant
that
motion.
some
--
almost
10
months
later,
i
think
in
the
second
pending
criminal
case
are
a
motion
to
dismiss
has
been
pending
at
least
that
long
has
never
been
acted
upon.
now,
i
would
submit
that
during
the
period
of
gestation
that
we
might
will
not
--
the
newspaper
may
will
not
have
existed.
now,
we
have
one
more
raid
of
this
nature
which
typewriters
and
all
the
implements
of
the
crime
or
seize
might
well
have
brought
it
to
a
halt.
we
felt
that
it
was
the
kind
of
circumstance
that
did
require,
did
warrant
injunctive
relief.
now,
independent
of
the
injunctive
relief,
we
think
that
what
we
did
in
the
relief
we
sought
here
was
clearly
on
the
contemplation
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
in
fact,
that
these
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
suggest
that
this
is
part
of
its
purpose
and
that
is
to
permit
persons
to
go
federal
court
to
obtain
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
without
risking
future
prosecution,
without
risking
further
harassment
under
a
state
statute
which
is
on
its
face
overbroad
and
unconstitutional.
quoting
from
the
senate
report,
“much
of
the
hostility
to
the
extensive
use
of
the
injunction
powered
by
the
federal
courts
will
be
obviated
by
enabling
the
courts
to
render
declaratory
judgments.”
and
again,
if
i
may
say
it
was
my
thought
initially
that
declaratory
relief
would've
been
ample
relief
for
us
but
there
was
--
we
had
a
three-judge
court
convened
it
was
seemed
a
reasonable
use
of
the
time
to
reinstate
a
prayer
for
injunctive
relief.
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
we
have
practice
in
texas
--
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
rather
jackson
versus
choate
says
that
whenever
the
issue
of
a
necessity
of
a
three-judge
court
is
raised
that
a
three-judge
court
would
be
appointed
to
determine
whether
it’s
required.
in
this
particular
instance,
i
would
--
have
never
by
pleadings
to
declaratory
relief
a
three-judge
court
was
appointed
to
determine
whether
this
required
its
action.
then
i
admitted
my
pleadings
thereafter
but
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct
and
i
read
the
cases
to
say
that
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
that
practice
is
that
when
the
issue
is
raised
as
to
whether
a
three-judge
court
is
required
that
the
practice
now
obtaining
is
to
under
a
decision
jackson
versus
choate
to
designate
a
three-judge
panel
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
or
not
their
action
is
required.
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
in
my
view,
no
sir.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
would
just
try
to
fair
it
out
the
record.
my
recollection
is
and
that
but
i
don’t
want
to
be
dishonest
with
the
record,
is
that
the
state
raised
either
and
perhaps
not
the
attorney
general
but
we
have
the
district
attorney
in,
we
have
city
attorney
in,
and
that
one
of
them
raised
the
question
of
whether
i
contain
declaratory
relief
from
a
simply
a
single
judge
when
that
raised
under
the
prevailing
practice
that
threshold
question
was
to
be
addressed
to
three-judge
panel.
the
three-judge
panel
was
appointed.
we
think
that
the
only
argument
that
would
address
itself
of
court's
action
is
whether
they
should've
abstained
from
acting.
we
think
it
quite
clear
that
under
baggett
and
under
harman
versus
forssenius,
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
state
court
interpretation
that
would
have
narrowed
the
statute
even
if
constitutional.
the
statute
clearly
punished
mere
possession
of
obscene
matter,
charges
that
were
filed
against
my
client
stein
were
simple
possession
as
counsel
perceives
of
what
was
alleged
to
be
obscene
matter
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
narrowing
construction
that
would
have
save
the
statute
and
under
those
circumstances
certainly
no
reason
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
do
you
mean
in
so
far
as
it
supports
the
inference
that
you
possess
for
the
purpose
of
distribution?
i
would
think
possession
of
200
would
suggest
an
inference
that
you
possess
the
newspapers
for
purposes
of
distribution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
let
me
say
your
honor,
that
this
case
has
a
peculiar
factual
rank
and
that
the
alleged
obscene
matter
that
residence
that
were
searched
was
a
residence
and
an
office.
the
upstairs
was
a
residence.
the
lower
part
was
the
office.
part
of
the
obscene
matter
upon
which
the
prosecution
was
founded
were
photographs
seized
in
the
bedroom
of
the
plaintiff
stein.
wholly
apart
and
separate
and
unrelated
to
the
publication
of
the
newspapers,
so
we
had
factually
a
very
close
stanley
kind
of
case
that
is
we
have
both
newspapers
downstairs
and
photographs
upstairs
that
were
unrelated
to
the
publication
of
the
newspaper.
i
mean
that's
in
my
view.
mr.
david
r.
richards
[laughter]
these
particular
films
were
in
cardboard
box
under
stein's
bed
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
put
it
into
stanley
context.
the
--
we
find
ourselves
then
as
we
view
the
case
that
we
have
no
2283
problems,
hence
since
we
did
not
seek
to
enjoin
the
pending
prosecutions
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
opinion
in
dombrowski
and
judge
haynesworth
in
baines
restraints
upon
on
future
prosecutions
are
beyond
the
reach
of
section
2283.
and
that
our
case
really
falls
within
that
narrow
area
of
comity
or
abstention
which
this
court
has
spoken
to
in
a
number
of
opinions.
i
guess
most
recently
it
seemed
in
zwickler
versus
koota
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
trial
court
in
a
case
such
as
this
had
the
duty
to
look
to
the
necessity
of
declaratory
relief
independent
of
the
determination
as
to
injunctive
relief.
and
we
think
that
in
this
instance,
the
declaratory
relief
was
clearly
proper
under
the
governing
decisions
of
this
court.
we
submit
that
this
court
when
it
said
that
wherever
the
federal
court
said
human
rights
under
the
federal
constitutional
are
always
a
proper
civic
for
adjudication
but
this
would
simply
the
kind
of
case
we
had
--
the
human
rights
we
have
where
searches
and
seizures
that
were
clearly
reminiscent
of
stanford
versus
texas
if
anything
they
were
worst
and
not
one
search
but
two
searches,
no
indication
by
the
dallas
police.
they
intended
to
abandon
this
course
of
conduct
relying
upon
a
texas
statute
that
on
its
face
was
overbroad.
and
we
would
suggest
that
this
case
actually
a
sort
of
a
proof
of
the
pudding
in
the
sense
of
a
necessity
of
a
principle
akin
to
dombrowski
or
akin
to
other
decisions
of
this
court.
that
is
facts
that
cry
out
for
some
relief,
cry
out
for
protection
under
the
federal
constitution
and
require
the
immediate
attention
and
cannot
be
allowed
to
languish
while
state
criminal
prosecutions
there's
been
no
inhibition
against
the
state
from
prosecuting
mr.
stein
and
we’re
now
almost
two
years
from
the
filing
of
the
original
prosecution
and
they
have
it
moved.
this
and
we
think
in
keeping
with
my
experience
at
least
while
i
practice
in
dallas
there
were
off
times
long
delays
from
between
the
filing
of
a
prosecution
and
its
all
for
a
disposition.
we
caught
ourselves
when
we
had
to
find
action
and
we
think
that
lower
court
order
is
quite
proper.
the
court's
opinion
addresses
itself
to
obscenity
not
only
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
punished
mere
possession
but
that
it
failed
to
contain
the
standard
that
was
appeared
expressly
in
memoirs,
again
in
redrup,
that
is
that
the
material
be
orderly
without
redeeming
social
value
but
texas
statute
did
not
contain
that
narrowing
deformation.
and
hence,
in
our
view
permitted
police
officers
such
as
in
the
instant
case
to
use
their
own
discretion,
seize
whatever
they
felt
inclined
to
seize
and
hence
the
statute
on
this
ground
was
overbroad.
in
this
connection,
we
do
submit
that
none
of
the
material
seized
at
least
it
appears
of
record
here
--
the
newspaper
clearly
was
not
obscene.
it
was
offensive,
it
may
have
been
in
bad
taste,
it
may
have
some
accorded
ones
views
but
it
clearly
was
pure
and
simple
speech
of
a
highly
political
character.
it's
a
dialogue,
a
rhetoric
that
it
is
new
but
it's
at
least
it's
political
and
it's
the
kind
that's
fairly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
finally,
in
closing,
we
would
say
that
the
texas
statute
although
the
lower
court
failed
to
pass
upon
it.
there
was
entire
alternative
ground
which
the
statute
could've
been
stricken
in
our
view
and
that
is
the
statute's
exemption
wholly
arbitrary
exemption
of
daily
and
weekly
newspapers
by
men
who
could
not
have
the
money
to
get
himself
out
once
a
week,
hence
fell
out
of
the
statute
because
he
published
twice
a
month
but
yet
the
statute
wrote
a
broad
exemption
for
daily
and
weekly
newspapers.
we
think
that
in
as
much
as
we
are
in
the
area
of
what
our
essential
fundamental
rights
of
speech
press
that
the
standard
by
which
this
statute
is
to
be
just
is
not
one
of
--
whether
its
arbitrary
but
rather
whether
this
serves
any
compelling
state
interest
that
is
the
exemption
as
daily
and
weekly
newspapers
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
to
be
served
by
that
exemption
and
that
provide
an
entirely
alternative
ground
to
affirm
the
court's
action
below
without
addressing
itself
to
mr.
zwiener’s
request
to
write
a
final
disposition
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
i
have
filed
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
reargument
your
honors.
it's
a
small,
thin,
blue
brief
in
which
i
attempted
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
declaratory
judgment
in
a
fashioned,
slightly
more,
i
hope
slightly
better
than
we
did
the
first
round.
the
opening
thought
that
i'd
like
to
convey
about
our
case
is
that
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
sought
to
abort
a
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
quite
the
contrary,
we
were
prepared
to
try
to
litigate
the
pending
criminal
cases
in
the
state
court
but
we're
frightened
about
future
prosecutions
which
threatened
the
existence
of
this
underground
paper.
this
was
not
a
resort
--
this
was
not
a
raise
to
a
forum
but
rather
a
resort
to
the
federal
court
to
seek
protection
for
substantial
federal
rights
that
were
threatened
with
extinction
by
the
dallas
police,
let
me
trace,
if
i
may
the
evolution
of
our
pleadings
and
partly
in
response
to
mr.
zwiener's
argument.
although
when
our
initial
complaint
was
filed,
it
did
seek
injunction
against
the
pending
prosecutions.
this
was
stricken
from
our
complaint
and
we
restricted
our
complaint,
our
first
amendment
amended
complaint
to
simply
a
prayer
for
relief
against
police
harassment.
this
appears
on
page
30
of
our
record
and
a
declaration
of
the
statute's
unconstitutionality.
we
were
content
to
litigate
the
matter
in
a
single-judge
court
at
that
stage.
the
state
then
filed
its
response
on
march
20,
10
days
later
and
urged
at
page
43
of
the
record,
that
this
matter
had
to
be
resolved
by
a
three-judge
court
that
is
urged
that
as
i
understand
their
pleading
that
even
though
we
sought
only
declaratory
relief
that
nevertheless
required
the
convening
of
three-judge
court.
so
as
appears
on
the
record
on
page
75,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
three-judge
questions
were
presented
and
at
that
stage
in
order
to
take
the
jurisdictional
issue
out
of
the
case,
we
re-instituted
a
demand
for
injunctive
relief
not
against
pending
prosecutions
but
only
against
future
prosecutions,
thereby
hoping
to
obviate
some
of
the
difficulties
in
the
case
but
on
hind
side,
i
think
we
would
have
been
very
advised
i
suspect
to
leave
our
pleadings
just
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
complaint
was
filed
in
january
your
honor
of
1969
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i'm
sorry,
the
northern
district
of
texas,
dallas
division.
mr.
david
r.
richards
your
honor,
united
states
district
court,
in
northern
district
of
texas,
before
sayre
v.
hughes,
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
mr.
david
r.
richards
did
not
file
any
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
we
in
the
state
court
did
seek
to
resist
the
criminal
prosecutions.
we
filed
motions
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
motions
to
dismiss.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
in
this
court,
the
lower
court
opinion
in
this
case
came
in
june
of
1969,
in
october
of
1969.
four
months
later
a
motion,
one
of
our
motions
to
dismiss
was
granted
by
the
trial
court
as
to
one
of
the
criminal
prosecutions.
arm
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
by
the
state
court
trial
judge,
yes
your
honor.
the
second
criminal
prosecution
remains
pending
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
surmise
along
with
counsel
that
the
state
may
not
think
--
can
convict
my
client
but
they
have
a
--
seem
fit
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
proceed
with
it
so
if
now
had
been
pending
for
some
two
years,
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
in
that
connection
when
we
filed
our
suit
in
the
federal
court,
were
one
of
our
principal
concerns
of
course
was
to
seek
to
return
the
material
the
police
had
confiscated,
they
had
in
raids
on
appearing
two
weeks
time
confiscated
six
typewriters,
two
desks,
cameras,
personal
possessions,
clothes,
everything
--
the
kind
of
sweep
that
even
by
the
--
well,
the
admission
of
the
police
officer
on
deposition
was
that
they
simply
cleaned
the
house
again.
the
return
from
the
police
search,
the
second
search
appears
on
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record
on
which
they
list
the
items
confiscated.
in
this
instance
they
got
three
cameras,
a
desk,
5
cardboard
boxes
containing
personal
records,
this
was
a
police's
char
a
--
police
characterization
of
what
they
took
not
what
we
characterize
it.
and
two
black
bell
system
telephones.
there
was
never
an
adequate
explanation
of
why
they
sought
to
seize
the
telephones
but
presumably
they
likened
the
telephones
in
as
much
as
they
were
an
adjunct
to
the
publication
of
the
newspaper
as
simply
part
of
the
contraband
they
were
taking
when
they
made
their
raid.
the
raid
by
the
way,
the
two
raids
were
made
upon
a
two
storey
house
that
served
as
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff
stein,
he
lived
upstairs
and
in
the
part
of
the
lower
floor
they
put
out
their
underground
newspaper.
on
the
first,
they
not
only
arrested
and
charged
the
plaintiff
stein
but
they
arrested
and
charged
on
both
occasions
everyone
they
found
on
the
premises.
during
the
first
raid,
they
arrested
two
people,
a
husband
and
wife
named
delaine,
mr.
and
ms.
delaine,
--
both
raids
were
conducted
at
night,
ten
o'clock
or
so
at
night
and
during
the
first
raid
they
came
in
and
they
found
mr.
and
mrs.
delaine
had
retired,
gone
to
bed
and
a
part
of
the
house
which
they
occupied
is
their
own
residence.
when
i
asked
the
police
officer
why
they
were
arrested
the
delaine's,
his
response
was,
they
were
arrested
because
they
were
there
and
the
obscene
material
was
found
there,
obviously
they
live
there.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
were
before
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
would
not
concede
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
will
certainly
hope
that
i
can
bring
them
before
you.
our
motion
--
the
case
blow
it
off
on
summary
judgment.
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
appears
at
page
57
of
the
record
states
that
plaintiff
in
making
his
motion
for
summary
judgment
relies
upon
the
depositions
a
defendant
police
officers
snyder,
mulligan
and
rogers
and
it
was
from
those
depositions
which
i
just
read.
now,
we
briefed
and
argued
in
the
trial
before
the
three-judge
panel
and
i
did
quite
extensively
quote
from
the
depositions
in
my
brief
to
the
three-judge
panels.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
i
may
say
your
honor,
we
were
invoking
the
equity
powers
of
our
court
below
and
i
think
necessarily
saying
to
the
court
that
the
facts
that
have
gone
before,
which
are
the
facts
i
have
recited
here
suggest
quite
strongly
the
threat
of
future
prosecutions
and
future
harassment
under
the
statute
and
it
was
in
this
fact
context,
we
would
say
that
the
court
looked
to
the
future
with
their
declaratory
judgment
saying,
“having
reviewed
what's
gone
before,
there
is
a
reasonable.”
very
recent
on
my
mind,
apprehension
on
the
part
of
this
plaintiff
that
he
will
be
subjected
to
future
prosecutions
if
he'd
try
in
searches
and
seizures
if
he
continues
to
publish
his
newspaper
and
in
light
of
what
the
dallas
police
have
done
in
the
past,
there
is
a
fair
reason
to
think
that
they
are
not
--
they
have
not
abandoned
their
efforts
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff
and
is
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it's
not
the
same
thing,
but
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
of
course
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
as
i
may
say,
i
know
it's
a
--
it
goes
behind
the
court's
opinion
below
somewhat.
i
know
that
judge
hughes
who
sat
on
the
state
district
bench
in
dallas
for
a
number
of
years,
served
the
legislature
from
dallas
county
before
coming
on
the
federal
bench
was
deeply
troubled
by
what
to
do,
that
is,
was
it
more
disruptive
for
her
to
issue
an
injunction
that
sought
to
compel
or
prohibit
police
conduct.
said,
in
judgment
on
the
day
to
day
activities
of
the
police,
was
that
more
disruptive
or
was
it
more
to
the
point
to
declare
this
statute
which
was
on
its
face
overbroad
unconstitutional
and
in
that
fashion
cure
the
underlying
evil
because
it
was
the
statute
and
it
what
--
the
obscenity
statute
which
was
we
say
facially
overbroad
upon
which
the
dallas
police
relied
in
victimizing
and
vandalizing
the
plaintiff's
residents.
mr.
david
r.
richards
now,
i
cross
--
i'm
going
behind
her,
our
opinion
but
i
already
--
free
judge
court
opinion.
but
i
think
quite
right
if
she
was
troubled
by
how
i
deal
with
this
problem
which
does
prevent
--
present
federal
questions
and
encouragement
upon
federal
rights.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
the
opinion
the
court's
opinion
is
a
dead
ball
for
a
summary
judgment
addressed
itself
solely
to
the
constitutional
--
constitutionality
statute
and
remanded
to
the
single-judge
my
prayer
for
injunction,
my
injunctive
prayer
sought
instructions
to
the
dallas
police
that
they
should
not
seize
material
and
sought
the
kind
--
the
typical
kinds
of
relief
that
one
would
seek
i
think
in
a
--
of
a
case
of
several
harassment
even
under
a
lawful
statute.
so
i
think
what
they
did
--
clearly
what
they
did,
they
remanded
that
matter
for
further
hearings
disposed
however
of
the
constitutional
question
on
hours,
on
summary
judgment
on
which
the
facts
i
have
recited
to
you
were
undisputed,
that
is
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
was
a
clearance,
the
most
--
clear
prior
restraint
one
can
imagine
of
course
that
that
what
the
dallas
police
were
engaged
in
doing
it
under
a
statute
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
quite
different.
but,
and
as
i
say
i
think
the
lower
court
below
was
con
--
felt
that
conceivably
by
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional
that
might
stay
the
hand
of
the
police
in
the
sense
that
they
were
relying
upon
its
over
breadth
and
swirling
around
my
plaintiff's
place
of
business.
parenthetically
the
injunction
that
issued
--
the
court's
opinion
issued
on
june
9,
1969,
the
lower
court
opinion
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional,
i
believe.
on
june
10,
1969,
the
texas
legislature
enacted
its
amended
statute
which
mr.
zwiener
has
alluded
to.
so
for
all
parenthetically
also,
the
injunction
ran
only
to
the
plaintiff,
it
didn't
run
to
a
broad
class
of
plaintiffs.
it
did
not
run
to
the
world
at
large
so
the
injunction
that
was
issued
here
was
a
very
narrow
injunction,
protected
this
plaintiff
against
prosecution
under
the
old
statute
and
declared
that
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no.
the
court's
opinion
issued
on
june
9,
1969,
june
9th,
and
on
june
10th,
the
next
day
the
legislature
amended
the
statute.
so
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
the
state
of
texas
appealed
this
case
to
this
court
and
we
have
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
your
honor.
as
i
say
and
we
have
continued
to
try
to
defend
the
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
state
trial
courts
where
they
--
and
successfully
got
one
--
and
attained
a
dismissal
of
one
of
them
since
that
time.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
other
one
has
not
been
tried.
mr.
david
r.
richards
correct
your
honor.
collide
--
anticipated
some
of
what
i
intended
to
say
but,
when
this
case
came
as
it
did
to
them
--
local
chapter,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
there
were
--
then
the
problems
they're
confronted
--
the
lawyer
assigned
to
the
case
were
not
--
how
to
abort
the
state
criminal
prosecutions
but
how
somehow
to
protect
this
underground
newspaper
which
seemed
to
be
entitled
to
publish
under
the
first
amendment
and
how
to
get
the
man's
material
back
to
him.
that
is
again
the
great
list
of
typewriters,
desks
and
cameras.
we
made
written
demand
upon
the
dallas
police
for
return
of
the
material
that
they
had
been
improperly
seized.
the
demands
were
ignored.
it
was
only
at
that
time,
only
after
demand.
that
suit
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
seeking
return
of
the
material.
seeking
relief
against
future
harassment
and
finally,
seeking
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
in
our
initial
argument,
justice
white
asked
me
at
least
on
one
occasion,
perhaps
two,
what
was
it
that
we
couldn't
accomplish
in
the
state
criminal
prosecution
that
necessitated
the
filing
of
the
federal
court
action.
and
i
would
say
they
were
these
things.
they
have
may
or
may
not
have
been
available
to
some
recovery
of
the
property
that
had
been
seized.
there
was
no
possibility
of
relief
against
future
harassment
as
an
outgrowth
of
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
there
was
little
likelihood
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
would
be
spoken
to
in
the
state
criminal
prosecution
as
much
as
it
has
been
previously
upheld
on
both
counts
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
is
our
highest
appellate
court
from
the
criminal
division.
so
all
of
these
things
could
never
have
been
answered
in
the
state
court
prosecution,
defense
of
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution
was
not
adequate
in
anyway
to
secure
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
became
operative
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
your
honor.
there
was
an
emergency
clause
that
made
it
effective
immediately
but
it
did
not
--
there
was
not
an
ex
post
facto
law,
no
your
honor,
did
not
operate
as
to
pending
cases.
mr.
david
r.
richards
didn't
--
insofar
as
i'm
aware
your
honor
it
did
not
speak
to
that
specifically
at
all
as
to
what
the
effect
was
upon
pending
criminal
prosecution.
it
was
simply
an
amendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
r.
richards
to
the
lower
court?
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
to
you,
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
have
not
argued
that
and
i
have
assumed
that
it
did
nothing
to
my
case
that
might
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
misspoke
myself.
i
think
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it
repealed
the
law,
it
amended
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
it
constituted
a
repeal
of
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
voided
any
pending
criminal
cases.
this
has
not
been
my
view
that
it
would
have.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
yes,
exactly.
now
we
have
–
if
i
may
say,
i
think
the
substance
of
the
relief
that
obtained
below
was
declaratory
relief.
certainly,
this
was
what
we
were
seeking.
we
were
seeking
it
as
i
say
on
behalf
of
a
continuing
enterprise,
it
was
continuing
as
best
it
could
under
the
circumstances
of
a
paper
that
was
going
to
be
published
every
two
weeks.
at
the
point
we
came
into
court,
the
plaintiff
had
lost
all
its
helpers,
even
they
were
afraid
to
come
around
to
his
address
for
fear.
they
would
get
hassled
by
the
police
and
off
the
police
station.
he
was
putting
out
the
paper
by
himself
at
that
stage,
borrowing
typewriters
and
whatever
else
property
was
required.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
state's
response
to
us
after
we've
deleted
the
declaratory
relief
in
lieu
of
the
injunctive
prayer
said
that
this
was
a
matter
for
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
well,
i
mean,
be
fair
your
honor.
i
had
initially
asked
for
the
injunction
against
the
prosecution.
i
had
deleted
that
from
my
pleadings
and
restricted
my
pleadings
to
declaratory
and
harassment
but
at
that
stage
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
was
at
that
stage
the
state
still
took
the
position
of
the
three-judge
court
was
required
and
at
that
point
chief
judge
brown
ordered
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
that
we
then
amended
our
pleadings.
only
at
that
time
did
we
re-institute
our
prayer
for
injunction
against
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
now
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
the
senate
report
on
declaratory
judgments
which
seems
to
--
at
the
time
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
enacted,
it
seems
to
us
in
all
fairness
that
this
was
the
precise
kind
of
case
which
declaratory
judgment
is
envisioned.
that
is
the
senate
report
in
its
concluding
paragraph
with
respect
to
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
stated.
finally
it
may
be
said
that
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
has
been
molded
and
settled
by
thousands
of
precedents
so
that
the
administration
of
the
law
has
been
definitely
clarified.
the
supreme
court
mentioned
one
of
its
principal
purposes
in
the
terrace
versus
thompson
when
it
said,
“they
are
not
obligated
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
we
think
here,
we're
not
talking
about
a
single
shot
proposition
that
is
one
act,
is
it
a
crime,
is
it
not.
we're
talking
about
a
continuing
publishing
enterprise,
a
newspaper
being
put
out
every
two
weeks
in
which
on
the
basis
of
past
conduct
by
the
dallas
police
and
the
dallas
district
attorney's
office,
there
was
every
reason
to
appear,
that
with
each
succeeding
issue,
we
would
be
subjected
to
a
new
prosecution.
in
this
context,
declaratory
relief
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
indeed,
it
seems
the
only
swift
and
appropriate
remedy
that
might
assure
us
that
as
to
the
future,
we
could
or
could
not
proceed.
it
was
in
our
view
at
least
then
a
traditional
form
of
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
the
early
cases
of
course
did
come
out
of
business
enterprise
kinds
of
cases.
in
terrace
versus
thompson,
as
my
memory
serves
me,
it
was
whether
an
alien
could
farm
land
in
some
state
in
the
pacific
northwest.
but
other
state
court
cases
have
dealt
with
the
problem
that
is
--
businesses
that
were
declared
unlawful
by
certain
state
enactments
and
the
owners
of
those
businesses
going
into
the
court
to
seek
declaratory
relief.
indeed,
the
senate
report
again
cites
as
a
prime
example
of
the
kind
of
relief
they
envisioned,
the
senate
committee
envisioned
at
least
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
statute
was
a
tennessee
case
in
which
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
that
where
pool
hall
operators
who
thought
they
were
having
their
rights
infringed
by
a
state
enactment
went
in
to
the
courts
for
a
declaratory
relief.
we
find
ourselves,
at
least
we
think
as
well
off
as
pool
hall
operators
who
felt
that
their
rights
were
being
concluded
by
a
--
dependent
by
the
existence
of
a
state
criminal
enactment.
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
my
judgment
is
that
attorney
at
the
time
was
that
i
wasn't
more
likely
to
obtain
swifter
response
to
my
prayer
in
the
federal
court.
my
second
judgment
was
that
i
was
pursuing
federal
rights,
first
amendment
rights,
rights
to
be
secured
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
rights
to
be
secure
against
harassment
in
the
traditional
hague
versus
cio
sort
of
context
and
that
the
federal
forum
was
an
appropriate
forum
and
as
i
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
did
not
seek
to
stay
and
did
not
think
i
could
obtain
a
stay
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
i
had
never
obtained
a
stay
against
pending
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
david
r.
richards
only
against
future
prosecutions,
not
against
the
pending
prosecutions.
there
was
never
and
that's
quite
clear
in
the
court's
opinion
in
my
prayer
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
think
a
declaratory
judgment
is
a
final
judgment
until
there
--
if
at
the
point
the
state
did
not
appeal
and
the
judgment
became
final,
i
think
that's
quite
right,
i
would've
relied
upon
it
for
injunctive
relief
but
not
at
least
until
it
became
final
and
its
not
final
till
this
day
in
terms
of
the
declaratory
relief.
i
do
not
consider
declaratory
relief
to
be
a
simply
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
injunctive
relief.
i
think
it
does
speak
to
the
future,
it
does
clarify
rights
and
this
was
precisely
the
problem
that
my
client
faced.
he
needed
to
know,
can
i
continue
to
publish
this
newspaper
in
dallas,
texas
under
or
am
i
going
to
be
victimized
by
the
statute
each
time
an
issue
comes
out.
and
it
was
through
this
looking
to
the
future
that
we've
spoken
our
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
and
the
pendency
of
the
criminal
prosecutions
to
me
at
least
were
simply
evidentiary
of
the
threat.
we
were
prepared
to
leave
them
alone
but
their
pendency,
the
fact
that
the
police
had
carried
out
the
searches
that
they
had,
it
seems
to
us
where
clear
evidence,
and
i
think
to
the
court
below
that
unless
some
declaration
of
rights
were
--
was
issued,
that
unless
the
court
used
its
equity
powers,
that
stein
and
the
dallas
notes,
and
the
underground
was
going
to
be
effectively
suppressed
by
simply
the
technique
of
taking
an
overbroad
statute
using
it
or
misusing
it
as
the
case
may
be
to
put
him
out
of
business.
and
so
again,
we
did
not
speak
to
the
pending
cases
and
we're
prepared
to
litigate
them
and
still
are
prepared
to
litigate
them.
i
think
at
this
stage,
it's
a
state
who's
indicated
the
reluctance
to
go
to
trial
on
the
pending
criminal
case
not
as
at
all.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
we
have
here
two
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
alright.
excuse,
i
mean.
i'm
not
sure--
i'm
not
sure
--
i
understand
there
were
two
arrests,
two
searches
and
seizures,
two
pending
criminal
prosecutions
from
the
time
we
went
to
the
federal
courts.
we
did
not
move
on
the
first
case,
we
did
not
go
to
the
federal
courts
until
there
had
been
a
repetition,
the
clearest
kind
of
repetition
that
they
were
going
to
engage
any
conduct
necessary
that
we
thought
to
suppress
our
paper.
it
was
only
then
that
we
went
to
the
federal
court.
and
after
going
to
the
federal
court,
after
getting
a
return
of
the
material
that
had
been
seized,
there
were
no
further
arrests
under
the
statute,
no,
but
they
were
not
restrained.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
what
respect
your
honor?
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
felt
we
were
entitled
to
seek
and
obtain
injunction
against
harassment.
the
case
happened
to
go
off
on
summary
judgment
and
of
course
that
they
were
disputed
fact
issues
with
respect
to
harassment
that
were
resolved
by
the
trial
court.
i
assume
there
was
a
denial
of
harassment,
a
denial
of
a
evil
intent
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
this
were
fact
issues
that
will
never
resolve.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
clarify
if
i
may
at
the
outset
one
matter
very
clearly
there
is
no
injunction
here
against
the
pending
prosecution
that
ironically
i
have
sought
only
declaratory
relief
below.
the
issue
was
raised
where
that
required
the
three-judge
panel
and
in
accordance
with
the
present
practice
of
the
fifth
circuit,
a
three-judge
panel
was
designated
to
decide
that
threshold
question
at
the
necessity
of
panel.
at
that
point,
i
amended
my
pleadings.
it
appeared
at
page
77
and
reinserted
the
prayer
for
injunctive
relief
with
the
exception
of
presently
pending
causes.
an
assumption
of
that
point
being
since
they
have
three-judge
is
coming
they
might
as
well
clarify
their
jurisdiction.
the
court's
opinion
at
page
81
characterizes
our
prayer
as
one
for
injunction
with
the
exception
of
presently
pending
causes.
and
i
would
assume
in
this
background
in
the
clear
interpretation
of
the
order
is
that
the
injunctive
order
runs
only
against
future
enforcement
of
the
statute
as
to
the
plaintiff
and
does
not
inhibit
the
processing
of
the
presently
pending
causes.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
sedulously
attempted
to
avoid
it
and
i
think
i
hope
i
successfully
avoided
2283
problem.
frankly,
we
do
not
think
we
even
have
to
turn
to
dombrowski
for
our
authority
but
we
can
go
back
to
1923
in
justice
butler’s
opinion
in
terrace
versus
thompson
which
i
think
quite
clearly
speaks
to
the
right
of
a
litigant
to
go
to
the
federal
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relied
against
the
enforcement
of
the
state’s
statute
which
impinges
upon
his
--
and
that
is
its
property
rights
but
the
opinion
broadly
addressed
itself
to
individual
freedoms.
mr.
david
r.
richards
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
david
r.
richards
terrace
versus
thompson,
263
u.s.
197.
equity
jurisdiction
will
be
exercised
to
enjoin
the
threat
enforcement
of
the
state
law
which
contravenes
a
federal
constitution
wherever
it
is
essential
in
order
effectuate
and
protect
property
rights
or
rights
of
persons
against
injuries
otherwise
irremediable.
we
think
that
the
past
sphere
show
just
that
kind
of
irremediable
injury
or
potential
injury.
the
plaintiff
is
a
young
man
publishing
an
underground
newspaper
in
the
city
of
dallas,
texas
grant
a
file
with
the
dallas
police.
as
the
head
of
the
vice
squad
admitted
on
his
deposition
the
police
became
concerned
about
the
newspaper
in
general
and
decide
to
go
to
district
attorney
and
show
him
copy
of
it.
now,
we
were
unable
to
reprint
the
copy
in
the
appendix,
it
is
a
part
of
the
record.
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
obscene
under
any
standard
extent.
the
district
attorney
o'brian
didn’t
look
obscene
to
him
so
the
dallas
police
didn't
get
their
search
warrant
there
in
afternoon
they
waited
until
night
without
the
(inaudible)
and
got
justice
otis
to
issue
a
warrant
to
seize
obscene
matter.
they
didn't
show
the
justice
otis
the
newspaper
upon
which
they
relied
to
obtain
their
warrant.
they
arrived
at
mr.
stein's
residence
about
10
at
night,
conducted
with
two
trucks,
a
dozen
police
officers
and
trustees
seized
by
their
own
admission
two
tons
of
newspaper,
periodicals,
typewriters
and
cameras,
money,
a
brown
sweater
even,
effectively
putting
mr.
stein
out
of
business
they
thought
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
was
one
of
the
items
they
seized
with
no
explanation.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
they
treated
everything
--[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
richards
--
everything
they
found
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
as
their
explanation
for
the
seizure
of
the
tables
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
this
was
apparently
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
police
officer
when
asked
of
on
deposition
why
he
had
seized
a
poster
of
mao
tse-tung
off
the
wall
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
can't
pronounce
the
name
properly,
mao
tse-tung,
the
premier
of
communist
china.
they
took
that
poster
off
the
wall
and
i
asked
why
was
it
seized
that
particular
item.
and
they
said,
we
did
not
know
what
to
take
and
what
not
to
take
so
simply
took
everything.
now,
that
was
on
october
30.
mr.
david
r.
richards
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
seems
to
me
as
the
factual
context
in
which
an
injunction
is
issued.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
say
if
i
may
your
honor
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it's
not,
it's
before
you
it
seems
to
me
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
was
relied
upon
by
the
dallas
police
who
felt
that
the
statute
gave
them
the
authority
to
make
on
the
spot
determination
as
to
the
obscenity
of
any
given
material
and
confiscate
that
material.
now,
that's
how
they
view
the
statute.
mr.
david
r.
richards
quite
right.
that's
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
understand,
maybe
i
do
but
let
me
at
least
say
that
at
least
in
colloquy
with
prior
counsel
and
in
earlier
cases
argued
about
yesterday
and
today,
i
sense
a
certain
feeling
upon
the
court
that
injunction
should
not
be
issued
except
in
somewhat
--
in
circumstances
which
demonstrated
a
continuity
perhaps
or
threat
of
continuing
violations
that
concern
that
first
amendment
rights
may
be
over
burden
by
a
pattern
of
conduct.
i
think
the
two
searches
and
seizures
here
do
reflect
the
kind
of
pattern,
the
kind
of
context
in
which
injunctive
relief
is
certainly
addresses
itself
to
lower
court's
discretion.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
did
not
seek
to
enjoin
of
any
prosecution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
let
me
make
myself
--
i
considered
that
the
injunctive
relief
i
sought
in
the
injunctive
relief
that
i
obtained
run
to
all
defendants
and
that
includes
the
dallas
police,
that
frankly
it
was
not
the
pending
prosecutions
that
represented
the
threat.
it
was
the
repeated
searches
and
seizures
pursuant
to
the
obscenity
statute
which
we
felt
assure
it
was
going
to
assure
that
demise
of
the
newspaper
if
they
persisted.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
if
i
may
say
at
that
time
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
was
the
highest
appellate
court
of
texas
with
respect
to
criminal
matters
had
addressed
itself
to
the
two
fundamental
issues
upon
which
i
have
attacked
the
statute
and
upheld
it.
one,
they
had
in
sullivan
versus
state
which
is
cited
in
my
brief
upheld
the
statute
in
so
far
as
it
made
criminal
simple
possession
of
obscene
matter.
so
i
assume
that
the
lower
court
of
texas
would
consider
themselves
bound
by
that
determination.
the
second
attack
i
made
on
the
statute
was
that
--
one
more
i
guess
the
protection
of
attack
that
the
exemption
the
statute
gave
to
daily
and
weekly
newspaper
was
rendered
in
unconstitutional
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
still
have
the
question
occurs
whether
that
--
yes
i
have
a
way
of
attacking,
they
could
go
on
trial
and
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
take
it
that
at
that
stage
i
--
the
remedy
i
would
assume
would
be
one
of
appeal
from
the
lower
court
condition.
mr.
david
r.
richards
my
excuse
if
i'm
required
to
have
one
is
that
i'm
dealing
here
with
the
publisher
of
newspaper
who’s
being
subjected
to
repeated
harassment
by
the
dallas
police
pursuant
to
this
statute
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
i
may
say
we
do
elude
in
our
brief
since
it’s
not
of
record.
we
filed
and
presented
and
argued
at
some
link
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
state
court
and
one
case
in
february
of
1969
and
its
finding
on
october
of
1969
that
the
state
court
did
grant
that
motion.
some
--
almost
10
months
later,
i
think
in
the
second
pending
criminal
case
are
a
motion
to
dismiss
has
been
pending
at
least
that
long
has
never
been
acted
upon.
now,
i
would
submit
that
during
the
period
of
gestation
that
we
might
will
not
--
the
newspaper
may
will
not
have
existed.
now,
we
have
one
more
raid
of
this
nature
which
typewriters
and
all
the
implements
of
the
crime
or
seize
might
well
have
brought
it
to
a
halt.
we
felt
that
it
was
the
kind
of
circumstance
that
did
require,
did
warrant
injunctive
relief.
now,
independent
of
the
injunctive
relief,
we
think
that
what
we
did
in
the
relief
we
sought
here
was
clearly
on
the
contemplation
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
in
fact,
that
these
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
suggest
that
this
is
part
of
its
purpose
and
that
is
to
permit
persons
to
go
federal
court
to
obtain
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
without
risking
future
prosecution,
without
risking
further
harassment
under
a
state
statute
which
is
on
its
face
overbroad
and
unconstitutional.
quoting
from
the
senate
report,
“much
of
the
hostility
to
the
extensive
use
of
the
injunction
powered
by
the
federal
courts
will
be
obviated
by
enabling
the
courts
to
render
declaratory
judgments.”
and
again,
if
i
may
say
it
was
my
thought
initially
that
declaratory
relief
would've
been
ample
relief
for
us
but
there
was
--
we
had
a
three-judge
court
convened
it
was
seemed
a
reasonable
use
of
the
time
to
reinstate
a
prayer
for
injunctive
relief.
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
we
have
practice
in
texas
--
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
rather
jackson
versus
choate
says
that
whenever
the
issue
of
a
necessity
of
a
three-judge
court
is
raised
that
a
three-judge
court
would
be
appointed
to
determine
whether
it’s
required.
in
this
particular
instance,
i
would
--
have
never
by
pleadings
to
declaratory
relief
a
three-judge
court
was
appointed
to
determine
whether
this
required
its
action.
then
i
admitted
my
pleadings
thereafter
but
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
correct
and
i
read
the
cases
to
say
that
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
that
practice
is
that
when
the
issue
is
raised
as
to
whether
a
three-judge
court
is
required
that
the
practice
now
obtaining
is
to
under
a
decision
jackson
versus
choate
to
designate
a
three-judge
panel
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
or
not
their
action
is
required.
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
in
my
view,
no
sir.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
would
just
try
to
fair
it
out
the
record.
my
recollection
is
and
that
but
i
don’t
want
to
be
dishonest
with
the
record,
is
that
the
state
raised
either
and
perhaps
not
the
attorney
general
but
we
have
the
district
attorney
in,
we
have
city
attorney
in,
and
that
one
of
them
raised
the
question
of
whether
i
contain
declaratory
relief
from
a
simply
a
single
judge
when
that
raised
under
the
prevailing
practice
that
threshold
question
was
to
be
addressed
to
three-judge
panel.
the
three-judge
panel
was
appointed.
we
think
that
the
only
argument
that
would
address
itself
of
court's
action
is
whether
they
should've
abstained
from
acting.
we
think
it
quite
clear
that
under
baggett
and
under
harman
versus
forssenius,
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
state
court
interpretation
that
would
have
narrowed
the
statute
even
if
constitutional.
the
statute
clearly
punished
mere
possession
of
obscene
matter,
charges
that
were
filed
against
my
client
stein
were
simple
possession
as
counsel
perceives
of
what
was
alleged
to
be
obscene
matter
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
narrowing
construction
that
would
have
save
the
statute
and
under
those
circumstances
certainly
no
reason
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
do
you
mean
in
so
far
as
it
supports
the
inference
that
you
possess
for
the
purpose
of
distribution?
i
would
think
possession
of
200
would
suggest
an
inference
that
you
possess
the
newspapers
for
purposes
of
distribution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
let
me
say
your
honor,
that
this
case
has
a
peculiar
factual
rank
and
that
the
alleged
obscene
matter
that
residence
that
were
searched
was
a
residence
and
an
office.
the
upstairs
was
a
residence.
the
lower
part
was
the
office.
part
of
the
obscene
matter
upon
which
the
prosecution
was
founded
were
photographs
seized
in
the
bedroom
of
the
plaintiff
stein.
wholly
apart
and
separate
and
unrelated
to
the
publication
of
the
newspapers,
so
we
had
factually
a
very
close
stanley
kind
of
case
that
is
we
have
both
newspapers
downstairs
and
photographs
upstairs
that
were
unrelated
to
the
publication
of
the
newspaper.
i
mean
that's
in
my
view.
mr.
david
r.
richards
[laughter]
these
particular
films
were
in
cardboard
box
under
stein's
bed
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
put
it
into
stanley
context.
the
--
we
find
ourselves
then
as
we
view
the
case
that
we
have
no
2283
problems,
hence
since
we
did
not
seek
to
enjoin
the
pending
prosecutions
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
opinion
in
dombrowski
and
judge
haynesworth
in
baines
restraints
upon
on
future
prosecutions
are
beyond
the
reach
of
section
2283.
and
that
our
case
really
falls
within
that
narrow
area
of
comity
or
abstention
which
this
court
has
spoken
to
in
a
number
of
opinions.
i
guess
most
recently
it
seemed
in
zwickler
versus
koota
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
trial
court
in
a
case
such
as
this
had
the
duty
to
look
to
the
necessity
of
declaratory
relief
independent
of
the
determination
as
to
injunctive
relief.
and
we
think
that
in
this
instance,
the
declaratory
relief
was
clearly
proper
under
the
governing
decisions
of
this
court.
we
submit
that
this
court
when
it
said
that
wherever
the
federal
court
said
human
rights
under
the
federal
constitutional
are
always
a
proper
civic
for
adjudication
but
this
would
simply
the
kind
of
case
we
had
--
the
human
rights
we
have
where
searches
and
seizures
that
were
clearly
reminiscent
of
stanford
versus
texas
if
anything
they
were
worst
and
not
one
search
but
two
searches,
no
indication
by
the
dallas
police.
they
intended
to
abandon
this
course
of
conduct
relying
upon
a
texas
statute
that
on
its
face
was
overbroad.
and
we
would
suggest
that
this
case
actually
a
sort
of
a
proof
of
the
pudding
in
the
sense
of
a
necessity
of
a
principle
akin
to
dombrowski
or
akin
to
other
decisions
of
this
court.
that
is
facts
that
cry
out
for
some
relief,
cry
out
for
protection
under
the
federal
constitution
and
require
the
immediate
attention
and
cannot
be
allowed
to
languish
while
state
criminal
prosecutions
there's
been
no
inhibition
against
the
state
from
prosecuting
mr.
stein
and
we’re
now
almost
two
years
from
the
filing
of
the
original
prosecution
and
they
have
it
moved.
this
and
we
think
in
keeping
with
my
experience
at
least
while
i
practice
in
dallas
there
were
off
times
long
delays
from
between
the
filing
of
a
prosecution
and
its
all
for
a
disposition.
we
caught
ourselves
when
we
had
to
find
action
and
we
think
that
lower
court
order
is
quite
proper.
the
court's
opinion
addresses
itself
to
obscenity
not
only
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
punished
mere
possession
but
that
it
failed
to
contain
the
standard
that
was
appeared
expressly
in
memoirs,
again
in
redrup,
that
is
that
the
material
be
orderly
without
redeeming
social
value
but
texas
statute
did
not
contain
that
narrowing
deformation.
and
hence,
in
our
view
permitted
police
officers
such
as
in
the
instant
case
to
use
their
own
discretion,
seize
whatever
they
felt
inclined
to
seize
and
hence
the
statute
on
this
ground
was
overbroad.
in
this
connection,
we
do
submit
that
none
of
the
material
seized
at
least
it
appears
of
record
here
--
the
newspaper
clearly
was
not
obscene.
it
was
offensive,
it
may
have
been
in
bad
taste,
it
may
have
some
accorded
ones
views
but
it
clearly
was
pure
and
simple
speech
of
a
highly
political
character.
it's
a
dialogue,
a
rhetoric
that
it
is
new
but
it's
at
least
it's
political
and
it's
the
kind
that's
fairly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
finally,
in
closing,
we
would
say
that
the
texas
statute
although
the
lower
court
failed
to
pass
upon
it.
there
was
entire
alternative
ground
which
the
statute
could've
been
stricken
in
our
view
and
that
is
the
statute's
exemption
wholly
arbitrary
exemption
of
daily
and
weekly
newspapers
by
men
who
could
not
have
the
money
to
get
himself
out
once
a
week,
hence
fell
out
of
the
statute
because
he
published
twice
a
month
but
yet
the
statute
wrote
a
broad
exemption
for
daily
and
weekly
newspapers.
we
think
that
in
as
much
as
we
are
in
the
area
of
what
our
essential
fundamental
rights
of
speech
press
that
the
standard
by
which
this
statute
is
to
be
just
is
not
one
of
--
whether
its
arbitrary
but
rather
whether
this
serves
any
compelling
state
interest
that
is
the
exemption
as
daily
and
weekly
newspapers
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
to
be
served
by
that
exemption
and
that
provide
an
entirely
alternative
ground
to
affirm
the
court's
action
below
without
addressing
itself
to
mr.
zwiener’s
request
to
write
a
final
disposition
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
i
have
filed
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
reargument
your
honors.
it's
a
small,
thin,
blue
brief
in
which
i
attempted
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
declaratory
judgment
in
a
fashioned,
slightly
more,
i
hope
slightly
better
than
we
did
the
first
round.
the
opening
thought
that
i'd
like
to
convey
about
our
case
is
that
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
sought
to
abort
a
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
quite
the
contrary,
we
were
prepared
to
try
to
litigate
the
pending
criminal
cases
in
the
state
court
but
we're
frightened
about
future
prosecutions
which
threatened
the
existence
of
this
underground
paper.
this
was
not
a
resort
--
this
was
not
a
raise
to
a
forum
but
rather
a
resort
to
the
federal
court
to
seek
protection
for
substantial
federal
rights
that
were
threatened
with
extinction
by
the
dallas
police,
let
me
trace,
if
i
may
the
evolution
of
our
pleadings
and
partly
in
response
to
mr.
zwiener's
argument.
although
when
our
initial
complaint
was
filed,
it
did
seek
injunction
against
the
pending
prosecutions.
this
was
stricken
from
our
complaint
and
we
restricted
our
complaint,
our
first
amendment
amended
complaint
to
simply
a
prayer
for
relief
against
police
harassment.
this
appears
on
page
30
of
our
record
and
a
declaration
of
the
statute's
unconstitutionality.
we
were
content
to
litigate
the
matter
in
a
single-judge
court
at
that
stage.
the
state
then
filed
its
response
on
march
20,
10
days
later
and
urged
at
page
43
of
the
record,
that
this
matter
had
to
be
resolved
by
a
three-judge
court
that
is
urged
that
as
i
understand
their
pleading
that
even
though
we
sought
only
declaratory
relief
that
nevertheless
required
the
convening
of
three-judge
court.
so
as
appears
on
the
record
on
page
75,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
three-judge
questions
were
presented
and
at
that
stage
in
order
to
take
the
jurisdictional
issue
out
of
the
case,
we
re-instituted
a
demand
for
injunctive
relief
not
against
pending
prosecutions
but
only
against
future
prosecutions,
thereby
hoping
to
obviate
some
of
the
difficulties
in
the
case
but
on
hind
side,
i
think
we
would
have
been
very
advised
i
suspect
to
leave
our
pleadings
just
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
complaint
was
filed
in
january
your
honor
of
1969
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i'm
sorry,
the
northern
district
of
texas,
dallas
division.
mr.
david
r.
richards
your
honor,
united
states
district
court,
in
northern
district
of
texas,
before
sayre
v.
hughes,
at
the
time
it
was
filed.
mr.
david
r.
richards
did
not
file
any
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
we
in
the
state
court
did
seek
to
resist
the
criminal
prosecutions.
we
filed
motions
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
motions
to
dismiss.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
in
this
court,
the
lower
court
opinion
in
this
case
came
in
june
of
1969,
in
october
of
1969.
four
months
later
a
motion,
one
of
our
motions
to
dismiss
was
granted
by
the
trial
court
as
to
one
of
the
criminal
prosecutions.
arm
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
by
the
state
court
trial
judge,
yes
your
honor.
the
second
criminal
prosecution
remains
pending
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
surmise
along
with
counsel
that
the
state
may
not
think
--
can
convict
my
client
but
they
have
a
--
seem
fit
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
or
proceed
with
it
so
if
now
had
been
pending
for
some
two
years,
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
in
that
connection
when
we
filed
our
suit
in
the
federal
court,
were
one
of
our
principal
concerns
of
course
was
to
seek
to
return
the
material
the
police
had
confiscated,
they
had
in
raids
on
appearing
two
weeks
time
confiscated
six
typewriters,
two
desks,
cameras,
personal
possessions,
clothes,
everything
--
the
kind
of
sweep
that
even
by
the
--
well,
the
admission
of
the
police
officer
on
deposition
was
that
they
simply
cleaned
the
house
again.
the
return
from
the
police
search,
the
second
search
appears
on
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record
on
which
they
list
the
items
confiscated.
in
this
instance
they
got
three
cameras,
a
desk,
5
cardboard
boxes
containing
personal
records,
this
was
a
police's
char
a
--
police
characterization
of
what
they
took
not
what
we
characterize
it.
and
two
black
bell
system
telephones.
there
was
never
an
adequate
explanation
of
why
they
sought
to
seize
the
telephones
but
presumably
they
likened
the
telephones
in
as
much
as
they
were
an
adjunct
to
the
publication
of
the
newspaper
as
simply
part
of
the
contraband
they
were
taking
when
they
made
their
raid.
the
raid
by
the
way,
the
two
raids
were
made
upon
a
two
storey
house
that
served
as
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff
stein,
he
lived
upstairs
and
in
the
part
of
the
lower
floor
they
put
out
their
underground
newspaper.
on
the
first,
they
not
only
arrested
and
charged
the
plaintiff
stein
but
they
arrested
and
charged
on
both
occasions
everyone
they
found
on
the
premises.
during
the
first
raid,
they
arrested
two
people,
a
husband
and
wife
named
delaine,
mr.
and
ms.
delaine,
--
both
raids
were
conducted
at
night,
ten
o'clock
or
so
at
night
and
during
the
first
raid
they
came
in
and
they
found
mr.
and
mrs.
delaine
had
retired,
gone
to
bed
and
a
part
of
the
house
which
they
occupied
is
their
own
residence.
when
i
asked
the
police
officer
why
they
were
arrested
the
delaine's,
his
response
was,
they
were
arrested
because
they
were
there
and
the
obscene
material
was
found
there,
obviously
they
live
there.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
were
before
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
would
not
concede
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
will
certainly
hope
that
i
can
bring
them
before
you.
our
motion
--
the
case
blow
it
off
on
summary
judgment.
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
appears
at
page
57
of
the
record
states
that
plaintiff
in
making
his
motion
for
summary
judgment
relies
upon
the
depositions
a
defendant
police
officers
snyder,
mulligan
and
rogers
and
it
was
from
those
depositions
which
i
just
read.
now,
we
briefed
and
argued
in
the
trial
before
the
three-judge
panel
and
i
did
quite
extensively
quote
from
the
depositions
in
my
brief
to
the
three-judge
panels.
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
i
may
say
your
honor,
we
were
invoking
the
equity
powers
of
our
court
below
and
i
think
necessarily
saying
to
the
court
that
the
facts
that
have
gone
before,
which
are
the
facts
i
have
recited
here
suggest
quite
strongly
the
threat
of
future
prosecutions
and
future
harassment
under
the
statute
and
it
was
in
this
fact
context,
we
would
say
that
the
court
looked
to
the
future
with
their
declaratory
judgment
saying,
“having
reviewed
what's
gone
before,
there
is
a
reasonable.”
very
recent
on
my
mind,
apprehension
on
the
part
of
this
plaintiff
that
he
will
be
subjected
to
future
prosecutions
if
he'd
try
in
searches
and
seizures
if
he
continues
to
publish
his
newspaper
and
in
light
of
what
the
dallas
police
have
done
in
the
past,
there
is
a
fair
reason
to
think
that
they
are
not
--
they
have
not
abandoned
their
efforts
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff
and
is
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it's
not
the
same
thing,
but
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
of
course
that
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
as
i
may
say,
i
know
it's
a
--
it
goes
behind
the
court's
opinion
below
somewhat.
i
know
that
judge
hughes
who
sat
on
the
state
district
bench
in
dallas
for
a
number
of
years,
served
the
legislature
from
dallas
county
before
coming
on
the
federal
bench
was
deeply
troubled
by
what
to
do,
that
is,
was
it
more
disruptive
for
her
to
issue
an
injunction
that
sought
to
compel
or
prohibit
police
conduct.
said,
in
judgment
on
the
day
to
day
activities
of
the
police,
was
that
more
disruptive
or
was
it
more
to
the
point
to
declare
this
statute
which
was
on
its
face
overbroad
unconstitutional
and
in
that
fashion
cure
the
underlying
evil
because
it
was
the
statute
and
it
what
--
the
obscenity
statute
which
was
we
say
facially
overbroad
upon
which
the
dallas
police
relied
in
victimizing
and
vandalizing
the
plaintiff's
residents.
mr.
david
r.
richards
now,
i
cross
--
i'm
going
behind
her,
our
opinion
but
i
already
--
free
judge
court
opinion.
but
i
think
quite
right
if
she
was
troubled
by
how
i
deal
with
this
problem
which
does
prevent
--
present
federal
questions
and
encouragement
upon
federal
rights.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
the
opinion
the
court's
opinion
is
a
dead
ball
for
a
summary
judgment
addressed
itself
solely
to
the
constitutional
--
constitutionality
statute
and
remanded
to
the
single-judge
my
prayer
for
injunction,
my
injunctive
prayer
sought
instructions
to
the
dallas
police
that
they
should
not
seize
material
and
sought
the
kind
--
the
typical
kinds
of
relief
that
one
would
seek
i
think
in
a
--
of
a
case
of
several
harassment
even
under
a
lawful
statute.
so
i
think
what
they
did
--
clearly
what
they
did,
they
remanded
that
matter
for
further
hearings
disposed
however
of
the
constitutional
question
on
hours,
on
summary
judgment
on
which
the
facts
i
have
recited
to
you
were
undisputed,
that
is
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
was
a
clearance,
the
most
--
clear
prior
restraint
one
can
imagine
of
course
that
that
what
the
dallas
police
were
engaged
in
doing
it
under
a
statute
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
quite
different.
but,
and
as
i
say
i
think
the
lower
court
below
was
con
--
felt
that
conceivably
by
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional
that
might
stay
the
hand
of
the
police
in
the
sense
that
they
were
relying
upon
its
over
breadth
and
swirling
around
my
plaintiff's
place
of
business.
parenthetically
the
injunction
that
issued
--
the
court's
opinion
issued
on
june
9,
1969,
the
lower
court
opinion
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional,
i
believe.
on
june
10,
1969,
the
texas
legislature
enacted
its
amended
statute
which
mr.
zwiener
has
alluded
to.
so
for
all
parenthetically
also,
the
injunction
ran
only
to
the
plaintiff,
it
didn't
run
to
a
broad
class
of
plaintiffs.
it
did
not
run
to
the
world
at
large
so
the
injunction
that
was
issued
here
was
a
very
narrow
injunction,
protected
this
plaintiff
against
prosecution
under
the
old
statute
and
declared
that
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no.
the
court's
opinion
issued
on
june
9,
1969,
june
9th,
and
on
june
10th,
the
next
day
the
legislature
amended
the
statute.
so
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
the
state
of
texas
appealed
this
case
to
this
court
and
we
have
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
your
honor.
as
i
say
and
we
have
continued
to
try
to
defend
the
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
state
trial
courts
where
they
--
and
successfully
got
one
--
and
attained
a
dismissal
of
one
of
them
since
that
time.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
other
one
has
not
been
tried.
mr.
david
r.
richards
correct
your
honor.
collide
--
anticipated
some
of
what
i
intended
to
say
but,
when
this
case
came
as
it
did
to
them
--
local
chapter,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
there
were
--
then
the
problems
they're
confronted
--
the
lawyer
assigned
to
the
case
were
not
--
how
to
abort
the
state
criminal
prosecutions
but
how
somehow
to
protect
this
underground
newspaper
which
seemed
to
be
entitled
to
publish
under
the
first
amendment
and
how
to
get
the
man's
material
back
to
him.
that
is
again
the
great
list
of
typewriters,
desks
and
cameras.
we
made
written
demand
upon
the
dallas
police
for
return
of
the
material
that
they
had
been
improperly
seized.
the
demands
were
ignored.
it
was
only
at
that
time,
only
after
demand.
that
suit
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
seeking
return
of
the
material.
seeking
relief
against
future
harassment
and
finally,
seeking
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
now,
in
our
initial
argument,
justice
white
asked
me
at
least
on
one
occasion,
perhaps
two,
what
was
it
that
we
couldn't
accomplish
in
the
state
criminal
prosecution
that
necessitated
the
filing
of
the
federal
court
action.
and
i
would
say
they
were
these
things.
they
have
may
or
may
not
have
been
available
to
some
recovery
of
the
property
that
had
been
seized.
there
was
no
possibility
of
relief
against
future
harassment
as
an
outgrowth
of
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution.
there
was
little
likelihood
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
would
be
spoken
to
in
the
state
criminal
prosecution
as
much
as
it
has
been
previously
upheld
on
both
counts
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
is
our
highest
appellate
court
from
the
criminal
division.
so
all
of
these
things
could
never
have
been
answered
in
the
state
court
prosecution,
defense
of
the
state
court
criminal
prosecution
was
not
adequate
in
anyway
to
secure
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
became
operative
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
your
honor.
there
was
an
emergency
clause
that
made
it
effective
immediately
but
it
did
not
--
there
was
not
an
ex
post
facto
law,
no
your
honor,
did
not
operate
as
to
pending
cases.
mr.
david
r.
richards
didn't
--
insofar
as
i'm
aware
your
honor
it
did
not
speak
to
that
specifically
at
all
as
to
what
the
effect
was
upon
pending
criminal
prosecution.
it
was
simply
an
amendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
r.
richards
to
the
lower
court?
mr.
david
r.
richards
not
to
you,
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
have
not
argued
that
and
i
have
assumed
that
it
did
nothing
to
my
case
that
might
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
misspoke
myself.
i
think
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it
repealed
the
law,
it
amended
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
it
constituted
a
repeal
of
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
voided
any
pending
criminal
cases.
this
has
not
been
my
view
that
it
would
have.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
yes,
exactly.
now
we
have
–
if
i
may
say,
i
think
the
substance
of
the
relief
that
obtained
below
was
declaratory
relief.
certainly,
this
was
what
we
were
seeking.
we
were
seeking
it
as
i
say
on
behalf
of
a
continuing
enterprise,
it
was
continuing
as
best
it
could
under
the
circumstances
of
a
paper
that
was
going
to
be
published
every
two
weeks.
at
the
point
we
came
into
court,
the
plaintiff
had
lost
all
its
helpers,
even
they
were
afraid
to
come
around
to
his
address
for
fear.
they
would
get
hassled
by
the
police
and
off
the
police
station.
he
was
putting
out
the
paper
by
himself
at
that
stage,
borrowing
typewriters
and
whatever
else
property
was
required.
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
state's
response
to
us
after
we've
deleted
the
declaratory
relief
in
lieu
of
the
injunctive
prayer
said
that
this
was
a
matter
for
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes.
well,
i
mean,
be
fair
your
honor.
i
had
initially
asked
for
the
injunction
against
the
prosecution.
i
had
deleted
that
from
my
pleadings
and
restricted
my
pleadings
to
declaratory
and
harassment
but
at
that
stage
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
was
at
that
stage
the
state
still
took
the
position
of
the
three-judge
court
was
required
and
at
that
point
chief
judge
brown
ordered
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
that
we
then
amended
our
pleadings.
only
at
that
time
did
we
re-institute
our
prayer
for
injunction
against
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes
your
honor.
now
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
the
senate
report
on
declaratory
judgments
which
seems
to
--
at
the
time
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
enacted,
it
seems
to
us
in
all
fairness
that
this
was
the
precise
kind
of
case
which
declaratory
judgment
is
envisioned.
that
is
the
senate
report
in
its
concluding
paragraph
with
respect
to
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
stated.
finally
it
may
be
said
that
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
has
been
molded
and
settled
by
thousands
of
precedents
so
that
the
administration
of
the
law
has
been
definitely
clarified.
the
supreme
court
mentioned
one
of
its
principal
purposes
in
the
terrace
versus
thompson
when
it
said,
“they
are
not
obligated
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
we
think
here,
we're
not
talking
about
a
single
shot
proposition
that
is
one
act,
is
it
a
crime,
is
it
not.
we're
talking
about
a
continuing
publishing
enterprise,
a
newspaper
being
put
out
every
two
weeks
in
which
on
the
basis
of
past
conduct
by
the
dallas
police
and
the
dallas
district
attorney's
office,
there
was
every
reason
to
appear,
that
with
each
succeeding
issue,
we
would
be
subjected
to
a
new
prosecution.
in
this
context,
declaratory
relief
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
indeed,
it
seems
the
only
swift
and
appropriate
remedy
that
might
assure
us
that
as
to
the
future,
we
could
or
could
not
proceed.
it
was
in
our
view
at
least
then
a
traditional
form
of
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
the
early
cases
of
course
did
come
out
of
business
enterprise
kinds
of
cases.
in
terrace
versus
thompson,
as
my
memory
serves
me,
it
was
whether
an
alien
could
farm
land
in
some
state
in
the
pacific
northwest.
but
other
state
court
cases
have
dealt
with
the
problem
that
is
--
businesses
that
were
declared
unlawful
by
certain
state
enactments
and
the
owners
of
those
businesses
going
into
the
court
to
seek
declaratory
relief.
indeed,
the
senate
report
again
cites
as
a
prime
example
of
the
kind
of
relief
they
envisioned,
the
senate
committee
envisioned
at
least
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
statute
was
a
tennessee
case
in
which
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
that
where
pool
hall
operators
who
thought
they
were
having
their
rights
infringed
by
a
state
enactment
went
in
to
the
courts
for
a
declaratory
relief.
we
find
ourselves,
at
least
we
think
as
well
off
as
pool
hall
operators
who
felt
that
their
rights
were
being
concluded
by
a
--
dependent
by
the
existence
of
a
state
criminal
enactment.
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
my
judgment
is
that
attorney
at
the
time
was
that
i
wasn't
more
likely
to
obtain
swifter
response
to
my
prayer
in
the
federal
court.
my
second
judgment
was
that
i
was
pursuing
federal
rights,
first
amendment
rights,
rights
to
be
secured
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
rights
to
be
secure
against
harassment
in
the
traditional
hague
versus
cio
sort
of
context
and
that
the
federal
forum
was
an
appropriate
forum
and
as
i
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
did
not
seek
to
stay
and
did
not
think
i
could
obtain
a
stay
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
i
had
never
obtained
a
stay
against
pending
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
david
r.
richards
only
against
future
prosecutions,
not
against
the
pending
prosecutions.
there
was
never
and
that's
quite
clear
in
the
court's
opinion
in
my
prayer
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
think
a
declaratory
judgment
is
a
final
judgment
until
there
--
if
at
the
point
the
state
did
not
appeal
and
the
judgment
became
final,
i
think
that's
quite
right,
i
would've
relied
upon
it
for
injunctive
relief
but
not
at
least
until
it
became
final
and
its
not
final
till
this
day
in
terms
of
the
declaratory
relief.
i
do
not
consider
declaratory
relief
to
be
a
simply
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
injunctive
relief.
i
think
it
does
speak
to
the
future,
it
does
clarify
rights
and
this
was
precisely
the
problem
that
my
client
faced.
he
needed
to
know,
can
i
continue
to
publish
this
newspaper
in
dallas,
texas
under
or
am
i
going
to
be
victimized
by
the
statute
each
time
an
issue
comes
out.
and
it
was
through
this
looking
to
the
future
that
we've
spoken
our
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
and
the
pendency
of
the
criminal
prosecutions
to
me
at
least
were
simply
evidentiary
of
the
threat.
we
were
prepared
to
leave
them
alone
but
their
pendency,
the
fact
that
the
police
had
carried
out
the
searches
that
they
had,
it
seems
to
us
where
clear
evidence,
and
i
think
to
the
court
below
that
unless
some
declaration
of
rights
were
--
was
issued,
that
unless
the
court
used
its
equity
powers,
that
stein
and
the
dallas
notes,
and
the
underground
was
going
to
be
effectively
suppressed
by
simply
the
technique
of
taking
an
overbroad
statute
using
it
or
misusing
it
as
the
case
may
be
to
put
him
out
of
business.
and
so
again,
we
did
not
speak
to
the
pending
cases
and
we're
prepared
to
litigate
them
and
still
are
prepared
to
litigate
them.
i
think
at
this
stage,
it's
a
state
who's
indicated
the
reluctance
to
go
to
trial
on
the
pending
criminal
case
not
as
at
all.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
we
have
here
two
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
alright.
excuse,
i
mean.
i'm
not
sure--
i'm
not
sure
--
i
understand
there
were
two
arrests,
two
searches
and
seizures,
two
pending
criminal
prosecutions
from
the
time
we
went
to
the
federal
courts.
we
did
not
move
on
the
first
case,
we
did
not
go
to
the
federal
courts
until
there
had
been
a
repetition,
the
clearest
kind
of
repetition
that
they
were
going
to
engage
any
conduct
necessary
that
we
thought
to
suppress
our
paper.
it
was
only
then
that
we
went
to
the
federal
court.
and
after
going
to
the
federal
court,
after
getting
a
return
of
the
material
that
had
been
seized,
there
were
no
further
arrests
under
the
statute,
no,
but
they
were
not
restrained.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
what
respect
your
honor?
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
felt
we
were
entitled
to
seek
and
obtain
injunction
against
harassment.
the
case
happened
to
go
off
on
summary
judgment
and
of
course
that
they
were
disputed
fact
issues
with
respect
to
harassment
that
were
resolved
by
the
trial
court.
i
assume
there
was
a
denial
of
harassment,
a
denial
of
a
evil
intent
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
this
were
fact
issues
that
will
never
resolve.
thank
you
your
honor.
