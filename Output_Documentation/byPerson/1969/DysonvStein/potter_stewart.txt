justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
in
this
case
there's
no
question
about
this
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
the
direct
appeal
of
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
there
is
an
injunction
very
clearly
on
page
94?
justice
potter
stewart
as
against
plaintiff
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
as
against
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
would
be
within
the
reach
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
barrier
to
the
plaintiffs
raising
their
constitutional
arguments
in
the
pending
state
prosecutions?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
plaintiffs
had
any
objections
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
obscenity
statute
they
could’ve
raise
those
objections
in
the
pending
criminal
prosecutions?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
just
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
based
on
the
unconstitutionality?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
in
the
one
of
the
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief,
isn't
it
similar
i
read
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
which
is
not
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
statute
is
not
on
the
books
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
judge
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
at
03:52
p.m.
on
the
february
9,
1970
according
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
pending
or
there
were
pending
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
if
the
district
court
was
quite
wrong
in
interjecting
itself
it
would
be
quite
wrong
of
us
for
--
to
continue
that
interjection
in
the
state
court
proceedings
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
if
you
really
mean
it
in
your
argument
at
the
district
court
--
the
three-judge
district
court
shouldn’t
have
interfere
here
then
certainly
we
shouldn't
approve
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
that
there
is
not
a
2283
problem
here
at
all
as
you
and
your
complaint
sedulously
avoided
it
and
that
the
three-judge
court
in
its
decree
did
likewise.
justice
potter
stewart
then
naturally
as
an
advocate
you’re
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
very
naturally
you
gave
us
that
background
but
none
of
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
before
us,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you're
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
these
particular
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
that
search
and
seizure
is
not
before
us
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
is
it
or
am
i
mistaken
if
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
the
three-judge
court
it
was
dealing
with
the
application
of
the
statute
to
your
clients,
it
was
dealing
with
the
statute
on
its
face
and
it
declared
statute
constitutionally
invalid
on
its
face
and
that's
our
issue
here,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
search
and
seizure
although
naturally
the
colorful
facts
of
that
or
something
that
he
was
an
advocate
want
to
tell
us
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
these
--
if
these
very
prosecutions
which
are
the
only
prosecutions
you
did
not
seek
to
enjoin?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
in
a
rather
odd
position
to
say
that
the
facts
of
these
prosecutions
are
what
entitle
you
to
an
injunction
when
you
--
these
are
the
only
--
these
are
the
very
prosecutions
you
did
not
ask
an
injunction
against?
justice
potter
stewart
why
couldn't
you
get
what
relief
you
wanted
in
the
pending
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
did
have
a
way
of
attacking
the
statute
in
the
pending
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
you
argue
that
even
if
you
must
wait
to
attack
in
the
state
court
and
in
a
state
trial
court
that
once
it
rules
against
so
you
could
go
to
federal
court
or
would
you
have
to
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
so
--
why
not
--
what's
your
excuse
for
not
going
that
route
rather
than
going
to
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
that
will
end
once
the
--
if
you
win
on
your
declaratory
judgment
case?
i
mean
in
that
will
end
if
you
win
your
--
if
you
win
on
your
objection
in
the
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
one
man,
one
book?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
what
has
happened
to
the
pending
prosecutions
in
the
texas
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
one
i
gather
from
the
briefs
has
been
dismissed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
the
time
the
brief
was
written,
the
one
i
read
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
last
night.
the
one
was
still
pending
and
i
wondered
what
had
happened
to
it
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
on
what
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
that
normal
for
a
prosecution
in
dallas
to
take
that
long
to
be
tried
and
then
(voice
overlap)
--?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
you're
going
to
get
the
answers
to
any
of
those
questions
in
this
case
here?
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
what's
causing
the
delay
of
the
trial
of
that
case
in
dallas,
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
this
particular
case
we
have
here
of
course
the
texas
court
have
have
had
just
about
two
years
now
to
try
this
case
in
this
prosecution
in
dallas
and
to
give
what
construction
they
may
want
to,
to
the
state
law
and
i
wonder
why
that
hadn't
moved
forward.
it
hasn't
been
enjoined.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
you
argue
that
a
district
court
should
abstain
or
should
not
intervene,
you
argue
on
the
basis
that
that
should
be
left
up
to
the
state
courts
and
the
state
courts
in
this
very
case
have
had
two
years,
and
have
done
nothing.
i
just
wonder
what
the
reason
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
pending
prosecutions
were
not
enjoined?
justice
potter
stewart
and
don't
you
think
there
are
some
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
pending
prosecutions
were
not
enjoined?
isn't
there
a
negative
implications
there
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
future
prosecutions
were
enjoined?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
mean
time,
you
long
ago
got
all
the
material
back
to
assist,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now
all
of
these
interesting
facts,
interesting
and
i
may
say
outrageous
facts
are
not
in
this
lawsuit,
they
were
not
considered
by
this
three-judge
court.
justice
potter
stewart
all
your
allegations
as
to
harassment
were
reserved
for
determination
by
a
single-judge
court
as
i
understand
judge
hughes'
opinion,
am
i
mistaken.
justice
potter
stewart
she
in
her
opinion,
she
says
that
what's
before
the
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
at
the
end,
in
an
order,
it's
found
that
the
section
1
and
part
of
section
3
of
the
statute
are
unconstitutional
and
the
dependents
are
permanently
enjoined
from
any
future
prosecutions
and
everything
else
having
to
do
with
the
harassment
and
which
would
include
this
searches
and
so
on
are
reserved
for
determination
by
a
single
judge.
and
i
had
assumed
as
i
prepared
for
this
case,
invest
the
argument
that
those
matters
were
not
really
before
us
at
all
in
this
case,
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
sure
you
did.
but
did
the
that
three-judge
court
decided
not
to
pass
on
that
part
of
your
case
as
a
three-judge
court
and
instead
to
direct
that
for
a
consideration
by
a
single-judge
court
so
far
it
appears
in
this
record,
the
single
judge
has
never
yet
acted
on
your
claim
of
harassment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
harassment
by
the
police
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
prosecution
by
a
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the,
insofar
as
your
lawsuit,
a
complain
of
harassment
by
law
enforcement
officers,
it
was
reserved
for
determination
by
a
singrjudge
district
court
and
the
injunction
of
future
prosecutions
by
the
prosecutor
even
in
all
good
faith
by
such
prosecutor
was
--
that
was
based
upon
the
--
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
probability
that
there
might
be
future
prosecutions,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
you
didn't
--
it
wasn't
you
who
asked
for
a
three-judge
court,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
originally
had
asked
for
injunctive
relief
against
harassment
and
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
at
least
as
applied
to
your
client,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
declaratory
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
injunction
of
future
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
in
this
case
there's
no
question
about
this
jurisdiction
of
this
court
on
the
direct
appeal
of
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
there
is
an
injunction
very
clearly

was

not
really
before
us
at
all
in
this
case,
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
sure
you
did.
but
did
the
that
three-judge
court
decided
not
to
pass
on
that
part
of
your
case
as
a
three-judge
court
and
instead
to
direct
that
for
a
consideration
by
a
single-judge
court
so
far
it
appears
in
this
record,
the
single
judge
has
never
yet
acted
on
your
claim
of
harassment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
harassment
by
the
police
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
prosecution
by
a
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the,
insofar
as
your
lawsuit,
a
complain
of
harassment
by
law
enforcement
officers,
it
was
reserved
for
determination
by
a
singrjudge
district
court
and
the
injunction
of
future
prosecutions
by
the
prosecutor
even
in
all
good
faith
by
such
prosecutor
was
--
that
was
based
upon
the
--
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
probability
that
there
might
be
future
prosecutions,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
you
didn't
--
it
wasn't
you
who
asked
for
a
three-judge
court,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
originally
had
asked
for
injunctive
relief
against
harassment
and
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
at
least
as
applied
to
your
client,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
declaratory
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
injunction
of
future
prosecution?
