mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
corporate
charter
which
was
involved
here
was
about
to
expire,
the
majority
stockholders
who
voted
to
extend
the
charter
and
enlarge
the
powers
of
the
corporation,
mrs.
quigley
on
379
shares
of
the
1200
outstanding
shares
of
the
corporation,
she
voted
against
the
extension
and
enlargement
of
the
corporate
charter.
with
her
having
done
that
under
the
iowa
law
the
majority
shareholders
were
required
to
purchase
her
stock
and
purchase
it
at
its
real
value.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
sir,
it's
started
off
in
the
initial
proceeding.
in
my
recollection,
it
was
$1,750.00
per
share
ultimately.
i
think
the
final
appraisal
was
$1,620.00
per
share.
the
majority
shareholders
had
three
years
within
which
to
purchase
the
stock.
in
accordance
with
the
iowa
law
they
comment
these
appraisal
proceedings
in
the
state
court
to
determine
the
real
value.
in
that
litigation
they
incurred
attorney's
fees
and
other
expenditures
which
they
later
sought
to
deduct
under
section
212.
the
internal
revenue
service
denied
the
deduction.
the
tax
court
affirmed
that
denial
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
tax
court
decision.
in
determining
whether
the
expenditures
in
this
case
are
deductible
for
federal
income
tax
purposes,
we
must
look
to
section
212
and
section
263
and
to
some
of
the
leading
court
decisions.
section
212
provides
that
an
individual
may
take
a
deduction
where
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
for
the
management
protection
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
this
of
course
is
a
counterpart
to
section
162
which
provides
for
deduction
of
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
and
carrying
on
a
trader
business.
but
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
individual
provision
which
is
section
212.
turning
to
section
263
which
deals
with
capital
items
we
find
this
provision
prohibits
deduction
of
capital
expenditures.
the
costs
of
asset,
tangible
or
intangible
that
have
a
life
an
excess
of
one
year
are
capital
costs.
they
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
some
examples
which
the
courts
have
recognized
are
the
cost
for
acquiring
or
disposing
of
capital
stock
and
the
cost
incurred
in
connection
with
corporate
reorganizations.
there
is
no
dispute
here
as
to
this
basic
substantive
tax
rules.
the
dispute
arises
as
to
which
of
these
rules
is
applicable
in
this
case.
the
woodward's
content
that
section
212
applies
and
provides
for
deduction
of
these
expenditures.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
contends
that
section
263
is
applicable
and
that
deduction
of
these
expenditures
is
prohibited.
the
woodward's
contention
basically
is
if
the
appraisal
cost
or
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
management
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
they
would
avoid
section
263
and
the
capital
expenditure
treatment
but
saying
that
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
real
value
of
the
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that
was
evolved.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
but
we
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
is
not
the
whole
picture
that
we
must
look
beyond
that.
we
say
that
you
cannot
look
just
at
that
segment
of
the
overall
transaction
and
we
think
that
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
that
fragment
of
the
overall
transaction
is
asking
the
court
to
close
its
eyes
to
the
entire
picture.
this
court
has
provided
precedents
that
help
us
in
approaching
this
problem
to
distinguish
between
deductible
expenses
and
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
in
the
gilmore
case,
already
mentioned
this
morning,
the
court
held
that
the
origin
and
the
character
of
the
obligation
from
which
an
expenditure
arises
determines
the
character
of
that
organization
of
that
â€“
the
expenditure.
in
the
gilmore
case,
mr.
gilmore
was
owner
of
three
general
motors
franchises.
he
encouraged
substantial
expenditures
in
connection
with
a
divorce
actions
started
by
mrs.
gilmore.
he
attempted
to
deduct
those
expenditures
on
the
theory
that
an
unsuccessful
defense
of
the
divorce
action
would
have
had
substantial
adverse
effects
upon
his
status
and
his
businesses.
and
that
therefore,
these
expenditures
were
incurred
to
protect,
manage,
and
maintain
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
he
was
victorious
in
the
divorce
action
but
this
court
held
that
the
character
of
the
proceeding
from
which
the
payments
came
determine
the
origin
and
character
and
that
therefore
mrs.
gilmore's
divorce
action
arose
out
of
the
personal
relationship,
the
marital
relationship
and
not
out
of
any
income-producing
activity.
accordingly,
the
expenditures
were
held
to
be
nondeductible
personal
expenditures.
now,
while
the
gilmore
case
involved
the
question
of
distinguishing
between
personal
and
business
expenses
we
just
think
that
nevertheless
that
this
broad
decision
by
this
court
indicates
a
principle
that
can
be
applied
in
determining
whether
an
expense
incurred
in
an
income-producing
activity
is
a
business
expense
or
a
deductible
expense
or
a
nondeductible
capital
expenditure.
in
this
decision
below
in
this
case
the
eighth
circuit
looked
at
this
overall
transaction
involving
mrs.
quigley
stock
and
decided
that
this
was
a
case
--
was
a
transaction
involving
the
purchase
of
a
capital
stock?
thus,
this
case
is
much
like
the
case
decided
by
this
court
some
30
years
ago
in
helvering
versus
winmill.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
was
engaged
into
buying
and
selling
of
securities.
he
attempted
to
deduct
the
brokerage
commissions
he
paid
but
the
court
held,
however,
that
the
commissions
constituted
a
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
of
the
securities
purchased.
and
that
therefore,
they
were
not
deductible.
we
say
that
there
is
much
comparison
between
the
brokers'
commissions
in
that
case
and
the
case
and
the
expenditures
incurred
in
this
case.
both
were
directly
related
to
acquisition
of
capital
asset
and
we
see
no
sound
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
two
merely
because
the
amounts
of
each
were
calculated
in
a
different
way.
the
woodward
expenditures
here
for
this
appraisal
proceeding
were
part
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
mr.
quigley
stock.
also
in
accordance
with
the
statute
requiring
the
purchase
of
that
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
then
that
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
right
and
that
mr.
justice
white
under
iowa
law
that
could
have
occurred.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
and
in
that
case
she
would
have
gone
along
with
the
corporate
extension.
i
think
at
that
time,
possibly
the
majority
stockholders
would
attempted
to
have
deducted
this
expenditure
or
written
it
off
as
a
capital
items
something
that
they
had
tried
to
do
had
failed
although
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
have
been
justified
because
it
was
an
expenditure
still
involved
with
this
corporate
statute.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
would
have
been
doubtful,
yes
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
possibly
if
they
were
going
to
be
deductible
possibly
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
these
expenditures
were
incurred
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporation
and
the
life
of
this
corporation
even
in
this
case
would
have
been
extended.
this
would
not
have
deprived
them
course
an
ultimate
deduction
because
it
would
in
such
case
have
been
added
to
the
basis
of
their
stock
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
--
to
be
recovered
later.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
presents
a
tougher
question
because
in
that
case
i
think
he
can
argue
that
he's
going
along
with
it
but
that
he
is
doing
this
to
conserve
and
protect
and
manage
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
true
but
does
not
quite
is
involuntary
as
it
sounds
mr.
justice
white
because
when
the
majority
stockholders
voted
to
extend
the
corporate
charter,
they
knew
that
if
any
stockholders
dissented
and
voted
against
him,
that
they
would
be
required.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
is
the
origin
sir.
i
think
that
decision
to
extend
it
is
the
origin
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment
but
i
think
in
addition
to
extending
the
life
of
the
corporation
for
their
own
stock
which
is
the
case
as
i
understand
you
present
they
here
acquired
some
additional
stock
which
is
a
little
different
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
right.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
is
a
decent
argument
sir
and
particularly
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
[laughter
attempt]
and
particularly
if
they
did
not
acquire
something
else
but
here
there's
another
staff
they
acquired
some
additional
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
why
i
could
agree
with
you
on
your
example,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
did
initially
but
he
convinced
me
during
of
course
of
the
argument
that
if
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
did
this
and
did
not
acquire
anything
out
which
is
the
case
we
have
here
then
i
think
a
good
decent
argument
can
be
made
as
mr.
justice
white
presents
it.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
does
sir.
i
think
that
here
we
have
an
acquisition
that
we
can't
ignore
that.
the
origin,
tying
in
with
the
point
of
mr.
justice
white
was
making
a
moment
ago,
the
origin
we
say
of
this
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
the
sole
question
of
determining
the
real
value.
we
think
that
if
the
origin
lay
in
the
decision
to
extend
the
corporate
charter
then
the
statute
required
the
acquisition
of
these
stocks.
so
we
say
that
our
origin
of
this
lay
further
back
than
just
picking
up
after
the
corporate
charter
have
been
extended
to
view
the
appraisal
proceeding
as
stemming
from
any
other
origin
we
think
is
to
ignore
the
entire
picture.
the
character
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
set
by
the
character
of
this
overall
transaction
not
just
by
the
little
question
of
what
is
the
value
of
the
stock.
the
appraisal
proceeding
thus
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
transaction.
it
was
an
integral
part
that
the
fact
the
statute
required
the
majority
stockholders
to
purchase
the
stock
and
afforded
the
appraisal
proceeding
machinery
does
not
change
the
character
of
the
appraisal
proceedings.
now,
the
woodward's
capitalized
the
stock.
they
paid
to
mrs.
quigley
for
her
stock.
we
see
no
difference
between
that
and
the
amount
of
money
have
cost
them
to
determine
what
that
figure
was.
it
was
a
part
of
the
total
cost
figure
they
paid
for
the
stock.
thus,
under
both
the
origin
and
character
test
and
the
cost
of
these
appraisal
proceedings
must
be
considered
capital
expenditure.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
though
she
was
getting
out
sir
so
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
they
paid
for
her
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
in
cash.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
we
think
it
helps
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
shows
a
guideline.
it
shows
how
you
approach
the
question.
certainly,
we
agree
with
you
that
the
gilmore
case
is
not
directly
in
point
but
we
think
it
is
a
light
that
shows
us
how
to
approach
this
question.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
except
as
a
guide,
that's
right
sir.
we
do
not
say
that
it's
directly
in
point.
the
result
for
which
we
are
here
that
these
expenditures
constitute
capital
expenditures
cannot
be
avoided
by
reference
to
the
primary
purpose
test
which
has
been
mentioned
in
many
court
decisions
and
also
argue
to
this
court.
that
test
comes
into
play
when
litigation
involves
a
defense
or
protection
of
title.
in
the
appraisal
proceedings
in
this
case
however,
it
was
no
question
about
who
own
title.
title,
question
of
title
was
not
involved.
therefore
as
the
eight
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision
the
primary
purpose
test
does
not
come
to
play
in
this
case.
even
if
it
did
however,
we
could
not
agree
with
the
woodward's
as
to
the
primary
purpose
of
these
appraisal
proceedings.
in
determining
that
purpose,
we
would
say
as
we
mentioned
earlier
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
entire
transaction,
the
overall
transaction
not
at
just
one
little
piece
of
it.
the
tax
law
does
not
allow
us
to
fragment
the
events
that
are
related.
thus,
we
said
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
was
to
complete
the
acquisition
of
mrs.
quigley
stock
which
was
a
part
of
the
overall
transaction.
the
fact
that
the
appraisal
proceedings
came
after
mrs.
quigley
was
deprived
of
her
stockholder
right
was
immaterial.
the
tax
law
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago
does
not
allow
us
to
separate
events
that
are
functionally
related.
it
not
only
does
not
allow
it,
it
prohibits
us
from
fragmenting
events
that
are
related
when
to
do
so
would
not
achieve
a
proper
tax
result.
thus,
we
say
that
the
timing
of
this
appraisal
proceeding
in
relation
to
other
events
in
this
integrated
picture
is
not
critical
but
we
say
that
the
functional
relationship
of
these
events,
the
appraisal
proceeding,
acquisition
of
the
stock,
that
they
are
very
definitely
and
directly
related
and
critical.
the
woodward's
have
argued
extensively
that
in
this
case
the
stock
owned
by
mrs.
quigley
passed
essentially
to
the
majority
stockholders
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
with
this,
we
do
not
agree
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
incision
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
even
if
it
were
so
we
would
say
that
this
does
not
make
any
critical
difference
in
this
case.
the
timing
of
the
events
which
are
directly
related
should
not
be
critical
in
determining
what
the
tax
consequences
are
one
of
the
little
fragment
is.
and
so
we
say
here
that
even
though
this
appraisals
proceeding
preceded
or
followed
the
transfer
of
title,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
corporate
charter
which
was
involved
here
was
about
to
expire,
the
majority
stockholders
who
voted
to
extend
the
charter
and
enlarge
the
powers
of
the
corporation,
mrs.
quigley
on
379
shares
of
the
1200
outstanding
shares
of
the
corporation,
she
voted
against
the
extension
and
enlargement
of
the
corporate
charter.
with
her
having
done
that
under
the
iowa
law
the
majority
shareholders
were
required
to
purchase
her
stock
and
purchase
it
at
its
real
value.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
sir,
it's
started
off
in
the
initial
proceeding.
in
my
recollection,
it
was
$1,750.00
per
share
ultimately.
i
think
the
final
appraisal
was
$1,620.00
per
share.
the
majority
shareholders
had
three
years
within
which
to
purchase
the
stock.
in
accordance
with
the
iowa
law
they
comment
these
appraisal
proceedings
in
the
state
court
to
determine
the
real
value.
in
that
litigation
they
incurred
attorney's
fees
and
other
expenditures
which
they
later
sought
to
deduct
under
section
212.
the
internal
revenue
service
denied
the
deduction.
the
tax
court
affirmed
that
denial
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
tax
court
decision.
in
determining
whether
the
expenditures
in
this
case
are
deductible
for
federal
income
tax
purposes,
we
must
look
to
section
212
and
section
263
and
to
some
of
the
leading
court
decisions.
section
212
provides
that
an
individual
may
take
a
deduction
where
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
during
the
taxable
year
for
the
management
protection
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
this
of
course
is
a
counterpart
to
section
162
which
provides
for
deduction
of
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
and
carrying
on
a
trader
business.
but
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
individual
provision
which
is
section
212.
turning
to
section
263
which
deals
with
capital
items
we
find
this
provision
prohibits
deduction
of
capital
expenditures.
the
costs
of
asset,
tangible
or
intangible
that
have
a
life
an
excess
of
one
year
are
capital
costs.
they
are
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
some
examples
which
the
courts
have
recognized
are
the
cost
for
acquiring
or
disposing
of
capital
stock
and
the
cost
incurred
in
connection
with
corporate
reorganizations.
there
is
no
dispute
here
as
to
this
basic
substantive
tax
rules.
the
dispute
arises
as
to
which
of
these
rules
is
applicable
in
this
case.
the
woodward's
content
that
section
212
applies
and
provides
for
deduction
of
these
expenditures.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
contends
that
section
263
is
applicable
and
that
deduction
of
these
expenditures
is
prohibited.
the
woodward's
contention
basically
is
if
the
appraisal
cost
or
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
management
or
maintenance
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
they
would
avoid
section
263
and
the
capital
expenditure
treatment
but
saying
that
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
real
value
of
the
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that
was
evolved.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
but
we
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
is
not
the
whole
picture
that
we
must
look
beyond
that.
we
say
that
you
cannot
look
just
at
that
segment
of
the
overall
transaction
and
we
think
that
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
that
fragment
of
the
overall
transaction
is
asking
the
court
to
close
its
eyes
to
the
entire
picture.
this
court
has
provided
precedents
that
help
us
in
approaching
this
problem
to
distinguish
between
deductible
expenses
and
nondeductible
capital
expenditures.
in
the
gilmore
case,
already
mentioned
this
morning,
the
court
held
that
the
origin
and
the
character
of
the
obligation
from
which
an
expenditure
arises
determines
the
character
of
that
organization
of
that
â€“
the
expenditure.
in
the
gilmore
case,
mr.
gilmore
was
owner
of
three
general
motors
franchises.
he
encouraged
substantial
expenditures
in
connection
with
a
divorce
actions
started
by
mrs.
gilmore.
he
attempted
to
deduct
those
expenditures
on
the
theory
that
an
unsuccessful
defense
of
the
divorce
action
would
have
had
substantial
adverse
effects
upon
his
status
and
his
businesses.
and
that
therefore,
these
expenditures
were
incurred
to
protect,
manage,
and
maintain
property
held
for
the
production
of
income.
he
was
victorious
in
the
divorce
action
but
this
court
held
that
the
character
of
the
proceeding
from
which
the
payments
came
determine
the
origin
and
character
and
that
therefore
mrs.
gilmore's
divorce
action
arose
out
of
the
personal
relationship,
the
marital
relationship
and
not
out
of
any
income-producing
activity.
accordingly,
the
expenditures
were
held
to
be
nondeductible
personal
expenditures.
now,
while
the
gilmore
case
involved
the
question
of
distinguishing
between
personal
and
business
expenses
we
just
think
that
nevertheless
that
this
broad
decision
by
this
court
indicates
a
principle
that
can
be
applied
in
determining
whether
an
expense
incurred
in
an
income-producing
activity
is
a
business
expense
or
a
deductible
expense
or
a
nondeductible
capital
expenditure.
in
this
decision
below
in
this
case
the
eighth
circuit
looked
at
this
overall
transaction
involving
mrs.
quigley
stock
and
decided
that
this
was
a
case
--
was
a
transaction
involving
the
purchase
of
a
capital
stock?
thus,
this
case
is
much
like
the
case
decided
by
this
court
some
30
years
ago
in
helvering
versus
winmill.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
was
engaged
into
buying
and
selling
of
securities.
he
attempted
to
deduct
the
brokerage
commissions
he
paid
but
the
court
held,
however,
that
the
commissions
constituted
a
part
of
the
cost
of
acquisition
of
the
securities
purchased.
and
that
therefore,
they
were
not
deductible.
we
say
that
there
is
much
comparison
between
the
brokers'
commissions
in
that
case
and
the
case
and
the
expenditures
incurred
in
this
case.
both
were
directly
related
to
acquisition
of
capital
asset
and
we
see
no
sound
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
two
merely
because
the
amounts
of
each
were
calculated
in
a
different
way.
the
woodward
expenditures
here
for
this
appraisal
proceeding
were
part
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
mr.
quigley
stock.
also
in
accordance
with
the
statute
requiring
the
purchase
of
that
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
then
that
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
right
and
that
mr.
justice
white
under
iowa
law
that
could
have
occurred.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
and
in
that
case
she
would
have
gone
along
with
the
corporate
extension.
i
think
at
that
time,
possibly
the
majority
stockholders
would
attempted
to
have
deducted
this
expenditure
or
written
it
off
as
a
capital
items
something
that
they
had
tried
to
do
had
failed
although
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
have
been
justified
because
it
was
an
expenditure
still
involved
with
this
corporate
statute.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
would
have
been
doubtful,
yes
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
well,
possibly
if
they
were
going
to
be
deductible
possibly
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
these
expenditures
were
incurred
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporation
and
the
life
of
this
corporation
even
in
this
case
would
have
been
extended.
this
would
not
have
deprived
them
course
an
ultimate
deduction
because
it
would
in
such
case
have
been
added
to
the
basis
of
their
stock
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
--
to
be
recovered
later.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
presents
a
tougher
question
because
in
that
case
i
think
he
can
argue
that
he's
going
along
with
it
but
that
he
is
doing
this
to
conserve
and
protect
and
manage
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
true
but
does
not
quite
is
involuntary
as
it
sounds
mr.
justice
white
because
when
the
majority
stockholders
voted
to
extend
the
corporate
charter,
they
knew
that
if
any
stockholders
dissented
and
voted
against
him,
that
they
would
be
required.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
is
the
origin
sir.
i
think
that
decision
to
extend
it
is
the
origin
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment
but
i
think
in
addition
to
extending
the
life
of
the
corporation
for
their
own
stock
which
is
the
case
as
i
understand
you
present
they
here
acquired
some
additional
stock
which
is
a
little
different
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
right.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
is
a
decent
argument
sir
and
particularly
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
[laughter
attempt]
and
particularly
if
they
did
not
acquire
something
else
but
here
there's
another
staff
they
acquired
some
additional
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
why
i
could
agree
with
you
on
your
example,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
did
initially
but
he
convinced
me
during
of
course
of
the
argument
that
if
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
did
this
and
did
not
acquire
anything
out
which
is
the
case
we
have
here
then
i
think
a
good
decent
argument
can
be
made
as
mr.
justice
white
presents
it.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
i
think
it
does
sir.
i
think
that
here
we
have
an
acquisition
that
we
can't
ignore
that.
the
origin,
tying
in
with
the
point
of
mr.
justice
white
was
making
a
moment
ago,
the
origin
we
say
of
this
appraisal
proceeding
was
not
the
sole
question
of
determining
the
real
value.
we
think
that
if
the
origin
lay
in
the
decision
to
extend
the
corporate
charter
then
the
statute
required
the
acquisition
of
these
stocks.
so
we
say
that
our
origin
of
this
lay
further
back
than
just
picking
up
after
the
corporate
charter
have
been
extended
to
view
the
appraisal
proceeding
as
stemming
from
any
other
origin
we
think
is
to
ignore
the
entire
picture.
the
character
of
the
appraisal
proceeding
was
set
by
the
character
of
this
overall
transaction
not
just
by
the
little
question
of
what
is
the
value
of
the
stock.
the
appraisal
proceeding
thus
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
transaction.
it
was
an
integral
part
that
the
fact
the
statute
required
the
majority
stockholders
to
purchase
the
stock
and
afforded
the
appraisal
proceeding
machinery
does
not
change
the
character
of
the
appraisal
proceedings.
now,
the
woodward's
capitalized
the
stock.
they
paid
to
mrs.
quigley
for
her
stock.
we
see
no
difference
between
that
and
the
amount
of
money
have
cost
them
to
determine
what
that
figure
was.
it
was
a
part
of
the
total
cost
figure
they
paid
for
the
stock.
thus,
under
both
the
origin
and
character
test
and
the
cost
of
these
appraisal
proceedings
must
be
considered
capital
expenditure.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
though
she
was
getting
out
sir
so
--
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
they
paid
for
her
stock.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
in
cash.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
that's
right.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
we
think
it
helps
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
shows
a
guideline.
it
shows
how
you
approach
the
question.
certainly,
we
agree
with
you
that
the
gilmore
case
is
not
directly
in
point
but
we
think
it
is
a
light
that
shows
us
how
to
approach
this
question.
mr.
johnnie
mckeiver
walters
except
as
a
guide,
that's
right
sir.
we
do
not
say
that
it's
directly
in
point.
the
result
for
which
we
are
here
that
these
expenditures
constitute
capital
expenditures
cannot
be
avoided
by
reference
to
the
primary
purpose
test
which
has
been
mentioned
in
many
court
decisions
and
also
argue
to
this
court.
that
test
comes
into
play
when
litigation
involves
a
defense
or
protection
of
title.
in
the
appraisal
proceedings
in
this
case
however,
it
was
no
question
about
who
own
title.
title,
question
of
title
was
not
involved.
therefore
as
the
eight
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision
the
primary
purpose
test
does
not
come
to
play
in
this
case.
even
if
it
did
however,
we
could
not
agree
with
the
woodward's
as
to
the
primary
purpose
of
these
appraisal
proceedings.
in
determining
that
purpose,
we
would
say
as
we
mentioned
earlier
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
entire
transaction,
the
overall
transaction
not
at
just
one
little
piece
of
it.
the
tax
law
does
not
allow
us
to
fragment
the
events
that
are
related.
thus,
we
said
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
was
to
complete
the
acquisition
of
mrs.
quigley
stock
which
was
a
part
of
the
overall
transaction.
the
fact
that
the
appraisal
proceedings
came
after
mrs.
quigley
was
deprived
of
her
stockholder
right
was
immaterial.
the
tax
law
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago
does
not
allow
us
to
separate
events
that
are
functionally
related.
it
not
only
does
not
allow
it,
it
prohibits
us
from
fragmenting
events
that
are
related
when
to
do
so
would
not
achieve
a
proper
tax
result.
thus,
we
say
that
the
timing
of
this
appraisal
proceeding
in
relation
to
other
events
in
this
integrated
picture
is
not
critical
but
we
say
that
the
functional
relationship
of
these
events,
the
appraisal
proceeding,
acquisition
of
the
stock,
that
they
are
very
definitely
and
directly
related
and
critical.
the
woodward's
have
argued
extensively
that
in
this
case
the
stock
owned
by
mrs.
quigley
passed
essentially
to
the
majority
stockholders
prior
to
the
appraisal
proceeding.
with
this,
we
do
not
agree
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
incision
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
even
if
it
were
so
we
would
say
that
this
does
not
make
any
critical
difference
in
this
case.
the
timing
of
the
events
which
are
directly
related
should
not
be
critical
in
determining
what
the
tax
consequences
are
one
of
the
little
fragment
is.
and
so
we
say
here
that
even
though
this
appraisals
proceeding
preceded
or
followed
the
transfer
of
title,
it
makes
no
difference.
