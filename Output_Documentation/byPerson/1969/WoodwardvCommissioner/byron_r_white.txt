justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
majority
stockholder
under
the
iowa
law
has
some
duties
with
respect
to
getting
the
expense.
he
has
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
he
has
to
deal
with
the
state
and
unless
the
life
is
extended
while
he
is
going
to
have
to
turn
his
stock
and
get
some
money
back
but
he
wants
to
retain
his
stock.
he
doesn't
want
the
corporate
charter
day
to
expire.
he
spends
some
money
to
make
sure
that
corporate
charter
doesn't
expire
so
that
he
can
keep
his
stock.
you
wouldn't
think
that
expense
is
deductible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
what
this
whole
operation
here
is
all
about?
no
but
he
didn't
want
to
buy
that
minority
stock.
the
law
made
him
buys
it.
what
his
major
purpose
is
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporation
so
that
he
can
go
on
holding
his
stock
through
which
he
earns
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
nevertheless
the
thing
that
triggered
this
whole
problem
was
the
desire
to
extend
the
corporate
charter
and
maintain
as
the
stock
ownership,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
that
the
origin
of
this
claim
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
that
--
let's
assume,
again
i'll
go
back
to
the
other
example
assume
that
the
dissenter
withdrew
his
dissent
after
these
expenses
have
been
incurred
and
he
wants
to
deduct
them
as
an
expense
incurred
to
maintain
and
safeguard
his
stock.
these
expenses
were
necessary
in
order
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporate
charter
and
to
perpetuate
his
ownership
of
the
stock.
justice
byron
r.

why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
decent
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
for
a
while.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
my
example,
they
didn't
anything.
wouldn't
he
say
he
could
deduct
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
would
be
the
expense
changes
carried
to
just
because
the
dissenter
didn't
withdraw?
i
mean,
it's
the
same
expense
--
it
has
its
roots
in
the
same
transaction.
it
maintains
the
same
justification
just
because
he
suddenly
gets
some
share
doesn't
change
the
character
of
the
expense,
doesn't
it?
