mr.
donald
p.
cooney
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
it
is
an
income
tax
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
the
cost
of
a
stock
appraisal
proceeding
held
in
connection
with
the
extension
of
a
corporation's
charter
are
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
production
--
excuse
me,
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
management
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
and
are
thus
deductible,
or
in
the
alternative
whether
they
are
capital
expenditures
paid
relevant
to
the
acquisition
of
title
to
corporate
stock
and
thus
nondeductible.
in
other
words,
this
court
is
asked
to
characterize
for
income
tax
purposes
money
spent
by
the
taxpayers
as
majority
shareholders
for
professionals
services
rendered
in
a
litigation
arising
under
a
state
appraisal
statute
wherein
the
only
issue
in
the
equitable
action
was
the
real
value
and
in
some
states
its
fair
value
of
the
dissenting
shareholders
stock.
the
character
of
this
deduction
so
far
as
the
taxpayers
maintain
is
to
be
determine
under
section
212
(2)
of
the
present
code.
this
is
a
successor
to
the
so-called
nonbusiness
deduction
section
that
was
added
by
the
1942
revenue
act
which
this
court
in
1965
was
called
upon
to
interpret
in
the
gilmore
case.
mechanical,
section
212
(2)
deduction
would
have
been
taken
on
last
year's
income
tax
return
that
would
be
the
one
for
1968
on
page
2
of
1040
under
itemized
deductions
under
this
section
entitled
miscellaneous.
this
year
under
the
new
forms
it
would
be
a
deduction
on
the
schedule
entitled
itemized
deductions
under
miscellaneous
deductions.
in
this
particular
instance
the
taxpayer
are
majority
shareholders.
the
majority
shareholders
are
people
the
petitioners
if
this
are
otherwise
in
the
companion
case.
the
factual
situation
involved
herein
was
precipitated
and
it
is
completely
controlled
by
the
iowa
renewal
statute.
if
you
want
wish
to
refer
to
it
like
at
this
particular
time
if
you
refer
turn
into
page
23
of
the
appendix
there
are
excerpts
of
the
opinion
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
the
last
paragraph
on
that
particular
page
contains
the
perhaps
of
the
statute.
this
is
a
little
bit
different
in
most
case.
this
is
not
by
way
of
the
apology
but
iowa's
corporate
law
link
to
something
to
be
desired
relative
to
speed
in
adopting
changes.
mr.
donald
p.
cooney
they
--
that
is
the
state
of
iowa
has
adopted
the
partnership
theory
of
the
corporation.
this
is
a
corporation
for
a
term
of
years
--
a
term
of
20
years
at
the
end
of
20
years
it
would
have
been
dissolved
because
this
is
a
contract.
as
i
understand
it,
it
goes
back
to
the
case
that
dartmouth
college
case
versus
woodward
and
the
case
is
subsequent
thereto
that
hold
that
it
is
the
corporate
charter
is
a
contract
between
the
stockholders
and
between
the
corporation
and
the
state,
and
between
the
state
and
the
stockholders,
a
three-way
type
contract.
this
is
important
because
at
that
particular
time
if
the
dissenting
shareholder
had
not
purchased
the
time
had
not
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
under
the
common
law
if
this
statute
wasn't
here
because
of
the
unanimity
of
consent
rule.
in
other
words,
this
was
a
contract
based
upon
a
partnership
law
and
everybody
had
to
agree
to
terminate
the
corporation
because
she
had
entered
the
dissenting
shareholder.
he
had
entered
the
agreement,
the
contract,
the
business
venture
to
go
for
20
years
and
it
could
not
be
stock
unless
there
was
some
reason
relative
to
it
was
better
--
it
would
be
better
for
the
investment
to
terminate
it.
then
there
is
law
that
would
indicate
that
you
could
then
but
she
had
agreed,
everybody
had
agreed
to
go
to
20
years
and
this
is
what
the
iowa
statute
has
been
for
me
is
initially
from
1851
until
the
middle
of
the
decade
of
40's
but
that
was
just
immediately
prior
to
the
last
renewal
for
20
years
of
this
corporation.
the
context
this
iowa
law
the
taxpayers
are
residents
of
iowa.
the
corporation
happens
to
be
a
newspaper
corporation,
that
once
a
radio
station.
the
taxpayers
control
approximately
70%
of
the
shares
of
stock.
the
dissenter
owned
approximately
30%.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
hadn't
been
an
offer
or
a
sale
of
this
stock
at
least
to
1950
that
is
the
evidence
in
the
valuation
case,
the
petitioner
of
which
in
the
supreme
court
decision
are
included
in
the
appendix.
so
the
corporate
charter
was
due
to
run
out
in
december
of
1961
having
been
renewed
for
a
term
of
years
in
december
1941.
that
a
meeting
was
held
with
notice
to
the
given,
etcetera
that
on
june
9,
1960
the
dissenting
shareholder
voted
against
the
resolution
to
extend
the
corporation's
charter.
now,
iowa
has
adopted
the
statute
which
has
show
on
page
32
--
23
of
the
appendix
49125
and
it
was
adopted
abrogate
the
common
law
rule
of
unanimous
consent
whereby
everybody
had
agree
to
every
fundamental
change.
incidentally,
in
iowa
the
extension
of
a
corporations
life
is
considered
a
fundamental
change,
this
is
otherwise
in
most
states,
in
other
words
the
model
corporation
act
indicates
in
its
annotation
there's
only
three
other
states
that
consider
the
extension
of
a
corporation's
life
is
a
fundamental
change
to
finance
the
problem
and
to
increase
economic
activity
and
to
proceed
toward
the
investor
management
theory
of
corporations
which
will
would
be
involved
in
the
next
case.
the
states
generally
change
or
adopt
the
statute
that
will
adopt
the
majority
rule
but
they
were
concerned
that
they
would
run
smack
into
the
due
process
clause
only
to
the
protection
of
contractual
rights.
so
as
a
compromise
to
finance
the
problem
they
granted
appraisal
rights.
in
other
words,
here
you
started
(inaudible)
shareholder
in
1941.
as
a
stockholder
we
agreed
to
go
to
1961.
we
want
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporation.
you
want
out,
alright,
under
the
common
law
she'd
have
to
continue
to
the
end,
it
would
be
to
the
end
and
everything
would
be
divided
up
pro
rata
and
of
course
with
the
income
tax
consequences
that
would
arise
from
dissolving
the
corporation.
then
in
return
for
year
for
letting
me
continue
we
will
give
an
appraisal
right,
fine.
all
right
now,
in
iowa
this
appraisal
right
is
a
finding
of
value.
no
judgment
is
i
asked
and
if
for
instance
in
this
particular
case
if
the
majority
stockholders
had
not
paid
the
defendant
--
excuse
me,
the
dissenter
dissenting
show
or
whatever
it
would
have
to
sue
on
the
judgment,
it's
important.
in
other
words
all
this
is,
is
a
judicial
determination
of
value,
this
is
a
closely-held
corporation.
the
dissenter
says
it
worth
(inaudible)
and
this
is
exactly
what
happen
and
the
majority
shareholders
says
would
nothing
and
there
is
a
judicial
determination
and
this
case
with
the
evidence
took
about
five
or
six
weeks
and
then
it
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
was
lowered
and
on
rehearing
it
was
lowered
again.
then
she
was
paid
in
1965.
now,
the
iowa
court
has
held
that
this
is
the
statute
extending
the
life
of
a
corporation
is
not
a
sale
and
purchase
transaction.
it
is
a
method
whereby
the
dissenting
shareholder
is
allocated
her
adequate
share
of
the
corporation's
assets.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
thousand
shares
during
december
of
1941
she
paid
$7,000.00
for
her
shares
--
excuse
me,
$3,000.00
for
her
shares.
the
majority
shareholders
paid
$7,000.00
for
theirs.
twenty
years
later,
when
it's
evaluated
what
is
she
entitled
too?
any
increase,
she
is
entitled
of
30%
of
any
increase.
it
is
not
a
sale
or
purchase
taxation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
advocating
we
represented
in
valuation
case
the
majority
shareholders.
we
were
advocating
strenuously
that
the
stock
should
be
discounted
because
it
represented
a
minority
interest
and
or
because
if
not
that
then
because
there
would
be
a
broker's
commission
taken
in
the
use
of
course
of
business.
now,
those
theories
of
course
arise
under
the
fair
market
value
cases
under
the
--
generally
under
estate
and
gift
taxes.
but
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
argument
they
said
what
he
or
she
entitled
to
if
she
would
have
continued?
there
being
two
of
course
the
question
arises
how
are
these
expenses
to
be
determined.
it's
our
understanding,
the
taxpayers’
understanding
that
there
are
two
questions
that
are
involved.
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
personal
expense
of
the
payor,
the
taxpayer
or
expense
that
arises
in
a
profit-seeking
venture.
this
court's
case
of
gilmore
enumerated
the
test
that's
now
referred
to
us
the
origin
and
character
test
that
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
expenditure
is
a
personal
expense
or
therefore
nondeductible
because
of
the
prohibition
in
the
code,
or
whether
or
not
it
would
be
any
expense
that
would
come
under
212
as
a
management
expense
or
expenditure
relative
to
property
or
for
the
production
of
income.
it
would
seem
without
--
by
just
reviewing
the
facts
or
situations
that
this
is
not
a
personal
expense.
this
are
--
this
is
in
a
profit
seeking
status
or
venture
or
context.
the
next
test
is
whether
or
not
the
item
--
the
expenditure
is
an
expense
that
would
be
deductible
or
a
capital
expenditure.
now,
we
are
maintaining
in
the
iowa
court,
the
delaware
court,
the
new
jersey
court
hold
that
this
is
a
nature
in
this
appraisal
statute
that
is
the
fundamental
change
statutes
that
give
us
appraisal
right
are
generally
considered
as
accounting
an
action
for
an
accounting.
in
other
words
the
dissenting
shareholder
says,
“i
am
entitled
to
“x”
number
of
dollars
because
the
increase
in
the
value
or
the
decrease
in
the
value.”
the
majority
shareholders
say,
“you
are
entitled
to
this
much.”
they
are
required
to
account
to
the
dissenting
shareholder
for
the
value
of
her
interest
in
the
corporation
if
she
would
have
continued,
in
other
words
if
she
had
wanted
out.
now,
this
court
in
gilmore
relied
on
its
origin
and
character
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
expenditure
is
a
--
is
personal
or
not
and
therefore
nondeductible
upon
--
principally
upon
the
bingham
trust
case.
now,
this
case
relied
on
the
kornhauser
case.
the
kornhauser
case
arose
in
1928.
it
was
a
case
--
it
was
an
income
tax
case
course
and
then
involved
the
deductibility
--
or
whether
or
not
an
expense
for
an
attorney
defending
against
his
ex-partner
defending
an
accounting
action
brought
by
his
ex-partner
for
the
value
of
some
stock
that
he
allegedly
had
received
there's
a
fee
after
the
partnership
was
dissolved
but
for
services
rendered
while
there
was
a
partnership.
he
was
--
that
is
the
action
in
the
action
of
accounting
it
was
held
that
not
withstanding
that
these
fees
were
for
the
defense
of
property
that
is
the
defense
of
--
the
title
to
property
that
they
were
deductible.
this
case
was
relied
on
in
the
bingham
trust
case
was
the
second
case
that
interpreted
this
particular
section.
if
you
--
one
who
would
lead
the
sections
and
the
taxpayers’
brief,
the
blue
one,
we
set
out
one
section
that
was
called
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
the
next
section
under
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1954
so
you
can
see
the
comparison
but
the
government
and
we'd
certainly
agree
that
essentially
the
law
is
the
same
under
this
section
even
though
the
numbers
are
different.
i
have
chosen
to
divide
at
my
argument
this
particular
point.
mr.
donald
p.
cooney
the
government
persists
on
making
an
analogy
with
the
expenses
of
the
appraisal
the
litigation
in
the
iowa
state
court
with
brokerage
fees
and
cites
winmill
case.
in
that
case,
we
don't
--
the
result
of
that
case
we
have
no
quarrel
with.
but
the
brokerage
fees
were
incurred
to
find
a
seller
for
a
buyer
or
a
buyer
for
a
seller.
this
is
not
what's
involved
here.
if
you
pick
up
your
telephone
and
want
to
buy
100
shares
at&t
you
don't
discuss
usually
the
value
of
at&t
with
your
broker.
he
executes
the
order,
this
is
what
he
does.
if
this
is
their
thinking
that
this
is
what
went
on
in
that
case
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
it
was
not
a
search
for
a
buyer.
there
was
one
that
was
brought
about
by
the
extension
statute
itself.
the
second
point
we
would
like
to
make
is
they
insists
in
dividing
these
or
exists
in
joining
the
two
actions
that
is
the
two
elements
of
this.
one,
the
extension
of
the
life
of
the
corporation
by
the
special
meeting
of
the
shareholders
and
the
evaluation
proceeding.
obviously,
the
evaluation
proceedings
wouldn't
have
occurred
but
for
the
shareholders'
action
in
renewing
the
corporation's
charter.
we
would
take
the
case
of
apsey
versus
kimball
of
this
court
which
appears
at
link
in
our
brief
on
page
15,
16
and
17.
this
it
would
seem
this
case
are
arose
in
1911.
it
would
seem
that
this
would
take
care
of
this
once
and
for
all.
the
iowa
court
quotes
--
or
excuse
me,
the
iowa
court
cites
this
case
in
its
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case
entitled
terrell
versus
ringgold
which
was
to
the
supreme
court
for
an
interpretation
a
various
aspects
of
this
evaluation
and
renewal
statute.
in
that,
they
held
without
doubt,
without
controversy
that
there
is
two
transactions
that
the
title
passes
under
statutes
like
this
when
the
vote
is
taken
simply
because
these
appraisers
--
appraisal
statutes
are
in
obligation
of
the
common
law
and
have
to
be
strictly
construed.
what
does
it
do?
if
you
get
out
of
the
business,
then
you
can
have
your
--
in
exchange
for
that
the
state
will
grant
you
the
right
to
dissenting
shareholder
the
right
to
have
their
shares
appraised.
in
this
particular
instance,
under
the
common
law
if
there
was
in
the
statute
the
whole
venture
would
have
terminated
at
the
end
of
the
20
years
in
any
event.
but
this
case
arising
under
a
statute
that
creates
a
federal
banking
corporation
and
was
cited
by
the
iowa
court
as
comparable
to
our
particular
statute
sets
adrift
his
argument,
the
government's
argument
relative
to
this
business
that
is
all
one
transaction
that
we
recognized
this
business
that
one
wouldn't
have
happen
but
for
the
other
one.
the
case
--
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
government
in
their
citing
and
using
the
gilmore
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
a
personally
expense
or
an
expense
or
an
expenditure
that
is
in
a
profit-seeking
context
--
arose
in
a
profit-seeking
context
but
it
can't
going
on
further
than
that.
this
court
in
its
bingham
trust
case
which
is
based
upon
the
kornhauser
case
enumerated
the
approximate
cost
test
which
it
approved
in
the
gilmore
case
which
very
easily
is
--
takes
care
of
the
problem
and
would
indicate
that
the
deductibility
here
would
arise
under
the
section
212
of
the
1954
code.
mr.
donald
p.
cooney
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
it
is
an
income
tax
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
the
cost
of
a
stock
appraisal
proceeding
held
in
connection
with
the
extension
of
a
corporation's
charter
are
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
production
--
excuse
me,
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
for
the
management
of
property
held
for
the
production
of
income
and
are
thus
deductible,
or
in
the
alternative
whether
they
are
capital
expenditures
paid
relevant
to
the
acquisition
of
title
to
corporate
stock
and
thus
nondeductible.
in
other
words,
this
court
is
asked
to
characterize
for
income
tax
purposes
money
spent
by
the
taxpayers
as
majority
shareholders
for
professionals
services
rendered
in
a
litigation
arising
under
a
state
appraisal
statute
wherein
the
only
issue
in
the
equitable
action
was
the
real
value
and
in
some
states
its
fair
value
of
the
dissenting
shareholders
stock.
the
character
of
this
deduction
so
far
as
the
taxpayers
maintain
is
to
be
determine
under
section
212
(2)
of
the
present
code.
this
is
a
successor
to
the
so-called
nonbusiness
deduction
section
that
was
added
by
the
1942
revenue
act
which
this
court
in
1965
was
called
upon
to
interpret
in
the
gilmore
case.
mechanical,
section
212
(2)
deduction
would
have
been
taken
on
last
year's
income
tax
return
that
would
be
the
one
for
1968
on
page
2
of
1040
under
itemized
deductions
under
this
section
entitled
miscellaneous.
this
year
under
the
new
forms
it
would
be
a
deduction
on
the
schedule
entitled
itemized
deductions
under
miscellaneous
deductions.
in
this
particular
instance
the
taxpayer
are
majority
shareholders.
the
majority
shareholders
are
people
the
petitioners
if
this
are
otherwise
in
the
companion
case.
the
factual
situation
involved
herein
was
precipitated
and
it
is
completely
controlled
by
the
iowa
renewal
statute.
if
you
want
wish
to
refer
to
it
like
at
this
particular
time
if
you
refer
turn
into
page
23
of
the
appendix
there
are
excerpts
of
the
opinion
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
the
last
paragraph
on
that
particular
page
contains
the
perhaps
of
the
statute.
this
is
a
little
bit
different
in
most
case.
this
is
not
by
way
of
the
apology
but
iowa's
corporate
law
link
to
something
to
be
desired
relative
to
speed
in
adopting
changes.
mr.
donald
p.
cooney
they
--
that
is
the
state
of
iowa
has
adopted
the
partnership
theory
of
the
corporation.
this
is
a
corporation
for
a
term
of
years
--
a
term
of
20
years
at
the
end
of
20
years
it
would
have
been
dissolved
because
this
is
a
contract.
as
i
understand
it,
it
goes
back
to
the
case
that
dartmouth
college
case
versus
woodward
and
the
case
is
subsequent
thereto
that
hold
that
it
is
the
corporate
charter
is
a
contract
between
the
stockholders
and
between
the
corporation
and
the
state,
and
between
the
state
and
the
stockholders,
a
three-way
type
contract.
this
is
important
because
at
that
particular
time
if
the
dissenting
shareholder
had
not
purchased
the
time
had
not
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
under
the
common
law
if
this
statute
wasn't
here
because
of
the
unanimity
of
consent
rule.
in
other
words,
this
was
a
contract
based
upon
a
partnership
law
and
everybody
had
to
agree
to
terminate
the
corporation
because
she
had
entered
the
dissenting
shareholder.
he
had
entered
the
agreement,
the
contract,
the
business
venture
to
go
for
20
years
and
it
could
not
be
stock
unless
there
was
some
reason
relative
to
it
was
better
--
it
would
be
better
for
the
investment
to
terminate
it.
then
there
is
law
that
would
indicate
that
you
could
then
but
she
had
agreed,
everybody
had
agreed
to
go
to
20
years
and
this
is
what
the
iowa
statute
has
been
for
me
is
initially
from
1851
until
the
middle
of
the
decade
of
40's
but
that
was
just
immediately
prior
to
the
last
renewal
for
20
years
of
this
corporation.
the
context
this
iowa
law
the
taxpayers
are
residents
of
iowa.
the
corporation
happens
to
be
a
newspaper
corporation,
that
once
a
radio
station.
the
taxpayers
control
approximately
70%
of
the
shares
of
stock.
the
dissenter
owned
approximately
30%.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
hadn't
been
an
offer
or
a
sale
of
this
stock
at
least
to
1950
that
is
the
evidence
in
the
valuation
case,
the
petitioner
of
which
in
the
supreme
court
decision
are
included
in
the
appendix.
so
the
corporate
charter
was
due
to
run
out
in
december
of
1961
having
been
renewed
for
a
term
of
years
in
december
1941.
that
a
meeting
was
held
with
notice
to
the
given,
etcetera
that
on
june
9,
1960
the
dissenting
shareholder
voted
against
the
resolution
to
extend
the
corporation's
charter.
now,
iowa
has
adopted
the
statute
which
has
show
on
page
32
--
23
of
the
appendix
49125
and
it
was
adopted
abrogate
the
common
law
rule
of
unanimous
consent
whereby
everybody
had
agree
to
every
fundamental
change.
incidentally,
in
iowa
the
extension
of
a
corporations
life
is
considered
a
fundamental
change,
this
is
otherwise
in
most
states,
in
other
words
the
model
corporation
act
indicates
in
its
annotation
there's
only
three
other
states
that
consider
the
extension
of
a
corporation's
life
is
a
fundamental
change
to
finance
the
problem
and
to
increase
economic
activity
and
to
proceed
toward
the
investor
management
theory
of
corporations
which
will
would
be
involved
in
the
next
case.
the
states
generally
change
or
adopt
the
statute
that
will
adopt
the
majority
rule
but
they
were
concerned
that
they
would
run
smack
into
the
due
process
clause
only
to
the
protection
of
contractual
rights.
so
as
a
compromise
to
finance
the
problem
they
granted
appraisal
rights.
in
other
words,
here
you
started
(inaudible)
shareholder
in
1941.
as
a
stockholder
we
agreed
to
go
to
1961.
we
want
to
extend
the
life
of
the
corporation.
you
want
out,
alright,
under
the
common
law
she'd
have
to
continue
to
the
end,
it
would
be
to
the
end
and
everything
would
be
divided
up
pro
rata
and
of
course
with
the
income
tax
consequences
that
would
arise
from
dissolving
the
corporation.
then
in
return
for
year
for
letting
me
continue
we
will
give
an
appraisal
right,
fine.
all
right
now,
in
iowa
this
appraisal
right
is
a
finding
of
value.
no
judgment
is
i
asked
and
if
for
instance
in
this
particular
case
if
the
majority
stockholders
had
not
paid
the
defendant
--
excuse
me,
the
dissenter
dissenting
show
or
whatever
it
would
have
to
sue
on
the
judgment,
it's
important.
in
other
words
all
this
is,
is
a
judicial
determination
of
value,
this
is
a
closely-held
corporation.
the
dissenter
says
it
worth
(inaudible)
and
this
is
exactly
what
happen
and
the
majority
shareholders
says
would
nothing
and
there
is
a
judicial
determination
and
this
case
with
the
evidence
took
about
five
or
six
weeks
and
then
it
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
was
lowered
and
on
rehearing
it
was
lowered
again.
then
she
was
paid
in
1965.
now,
the
iowa
court
has
held
that
this
is
the
statute
extending
the
life
of
a
corporation
is
not
a
sale
and
purchase
transaction.
it
is
a
method
whereby
the
dissenting
shareholder
is
allocated
her
adequate
share
of
the
corporation's
assets.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
thousand
shares
during
december
of
1941
she
paid
$7,000.00
for
her
shares
--
excuse
me,
$3,000.00
for
her
shares.
the
majority
shareholders
paid
$7,000.00
for
theirs.
twenty
years
later,
when
it's
evaluated
what
is
she
entitled
too?
any
increase,
she
is
entitled
of
30%
of
any
increase.
it
is
not
a
sale
or
purchase
taxation.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
advocating
we
represented
in
valuation
case
the
majority
shareholders.
we
were
advocating
strenuously
that
the
stock
should
be
discounted
because
it
represented
a
minority
interest
and
or
because
if
not
that
then
because
there
would
be
a
broker's
commission
taken
in
the
use
of
course
of
business.
now,
those
theories
of
course
arise
under
the
fair
market
value
cases
under
the
--
generally
under
estate
and
gift
taxes.
but
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
argument
they
said
what
he
or
she
entitled
to
if
she
would
have
continued?
there
being
two
of
course
the
question
arises
how
are
these
expenses
to
be
determined.
it's
our
understanding,
the
taxpayers’
understanding
that
there
are
two
questions
that
are
involved.
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
personal
expense
of
the
payor,
the
taxpayer
or
expense
that
arises
in
a
profit-seeking
venture.
this
court's
case
of
gilmore
enumerated
the
test
that's
now
referred
to
us
the
origin
and
character
test
that
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
expenditure
is
a
personal
expense
or
therefore
nondeductible
because
of
the
prohibition
in
the
code,
or
whether
or
not
it
would
be
any
expense
that
would
come
under
212
as
a
management
expense
or
expenditure
relative
to
property
or
for
the
production
of
income.
it
would
seem
without
--
by
just
reviewing
the
facts
or
situations
that
this
is
not
a
personal
expense.
this
are
--
this
is
in
a
profit
seeking
status
or
venture
or
context.
the
next
test
is
whether
or
not
the
item
--
the
expenditure
is
an
expense
that
would
be
deductible
or
a
capital
expenditure.
now,
we
are
maintaining
in
the
iowa
court,
the
delaware
court,
the
new
jersey
court
hold
that
this
is
a
nature
in
this
appraisal
statute
that
is
the
fundamental
change
statutes
that
give
us
appraisal
right
are
generally
considered
as
accounting
an
action
for
an
accounting.
in
other
words
the
dissenting
shareholder
says,
“i
am
entitled
to
“x”
number
of
dollars
because
the
increase
in
the
value
or
the
decrease
in
the
value.”
the
majority
shareholders
say,
“you
are
entitled
to
this
much.”
they
are
required
to
account
to
the
dissenting
shareholder
for
the
value
of
her
interest
in
the
corporation
if
she
would
have
continued,
in
other
words
if
she
had
wanted
out.
now,
this
court
in
gilmore
relied
on
its
origin
and
character
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
expenditure
is
a
--
is
personal
or
not
and
therefore
nondeductible
upon
--
principally
upon
the
bingham
trust
case.
now,
this
case
relied
on
the
kornhauser
case.
the
kornhauser
case
arose
in
1928.
it
was
a
case
--
it
was
an
income
tax
case
course
and
then
involved
the
deductibility
--
or
whether
or
not
an
expense
for
an
attorney
defending
against
his
ex-partner
defending
an
accounting
action
brought
by
his
ex-partner
for
the
value
of
some
stock
that
he
allegedly
had
received
there's
a
fee
after
the
partnership
was
dissolved
but
for
services
rendered
while
there
was
a
partnership.
he
was
--
that
is
the
action
in
the
action
of
accounting
it
was
held
that
not
withstanding
that
these
fees
were
for
the
defense
of
property
that
is
the
defense
of
--
the
title
to
property
that
they
were
deductible.
this
case
was
relied
on
in
the
bingham
trust
case
was
the
second
case
that
interpreted
this
particular
section.
if
you
--
one
who
would
lead
the
sections
and
the
taxpayers’
brief,
the
blue
one,
we
set
out
one
section
that
was
called
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
the
next
section
under
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1954
so
you
can
see
the
comparison
but
the
government
and
we'd
certainly
agree
that
essentially
the
law
is
the
same
under
this
section
even
though
the
numbers
are
different.
i
have
chosen
to
divide
at
my
argument
this
particular
point.
mr.
donald
p.
cooney
the
government
persists
on
making
an
analogy
with
the
expenses
of
the
appraisal
the
litigation
in
the
iowa
state
court
with
brokerage
fees
and
cites
winmill
case.
in
that
case,
we
don't
--
the
result
of
that
case
we
have
no
quarrel
with.
but
the
brokerage
fees
were
incurred
to
find
a
seller
for
a
buyer
or
a
buyer
for
a
seller.
this
is
not
what's
involved
here.
if
you
pick
up
your
telephone
and
want
to
buy
100
shares
at&t
you
don't
discuss
usually
the
value
of
at&t
with
your
broker.
he
executes
the
order,
this
is
what
he
does.
if
this
is
their
thinking
that
this
is
what
went
on
in
that
case
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
it
was
not
a
search
for
a
buyer.
there
was
one
that
was
brought
about
by
the
extension
statute
itself.
the
second
point
we
would
like
to
make
is
they
insists
in
dividing
these
or
exists
in
joining
the
two
actions
that
is
the
two
elements
of
this.
one,
the
extension
of
the
life
of
the
corporation
by
the
special
meeting
of
the
shareholders
and
the
evaluation
proceeding.
obviously,
the
evaluation
proceedings
wouldn't
have
occurred
but
for
the
shareholders'
action
in
renewing
the
corporation's
charter.
we
would
take
the
case
of
apsey
versus
kimball
of
this
court
which
appears
at
link
in
our
brief
on
page
15,
16
and
17.
this
it
would
seem
this
case
are
arose
in
1911.
it
would
seem
that
this
would
take
care
of
this
once
and
for
all.
the
iowa
court
quotes
--
or
excuse
me,
the
iowa
court
cites
this
case
in
its
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case
entitled
terrell
versus
ringgold
which
was
to
the
supreme
court
for
an
interpretation
a
various
aspects
of
this
evaluation
and
renewal
statute.
in
that,
they
held
without
doubt,
without
controversy
that
there
is
two
transactions
that
the
title
passes
under
statutes
like
this
when
the
vote
is
taken
simply
because
these
appraisers
--
appraisal
statutes
are
in
obligation
of
the
common
law
and
have
to
be
strictly
construed.
what
does
it
do?
if
you
get
out
of
the
business,
then
you
can
have
your
--
in
exchange
for
that
the
state
will
grant
you
the
right
to
dissenting
shareholder
the
right
to
have
their
shares
appraised.
in
this
particular
instance,
under
the
common
law
if
there
was
in
the
statute
the
whole
venture
would
have
terminated
at
the
end
of
the
20
years
in
any
event.
but
this
case
arising
under
a
statute
that
creates
a
federal
banking
corporation
and
was
cited
by
the
iowa
court
as
comparable
to
our
particular
statute
sets
adrift
his
argument,
the
government's
argument
relative
to
this
business
that
is
all
one
transaction
that
we
recognized
this
business
that
one
wouldn't
have
happen
but
for
the
other
one.
the
case
--
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
government
in
their
citing
and
using
the
gilmore
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
a
personally
expense
or
an
expense
or
an
expenditure
that
is
in
a
profit-seeking
context
--
arose
in
a
profit-seeking
context
but
it
can't
going
on
further
than
that.
this
court
in
its
bingham
trust
case
which
is
based
upon
the
kornhauser
case
enumerated
the
approximate
cost
test
which
it
approved
in
the
gilmore
case
which
very
easily
is
--
takes
care
of
the
problem
and
would
indicate
that
the
deductibility
here
would
arise
under
the
section
212
of
the
1954
code.
