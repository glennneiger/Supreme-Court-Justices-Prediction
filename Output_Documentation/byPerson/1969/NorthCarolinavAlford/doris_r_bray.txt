ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
transcript
from
which
mr.
safron
read
is
the
transcript
at
the
time
when
the
guilty
plea
was
tendered.
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
record
i
believe
since
the
district
court’s
consideration
of
the
last
habeas
petition.
there
was
a
prior
habeas
petition
also.
but
this
transcript
was
not
available
in
the
prior
consideration
of
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
procedure
in
north
carolina
upon
tender
of
guilty
plea
is
that
the
state
in
narrative
form
presents
what
it
contends
is
its
evidence.
but
it’s
a
hearsay
sort
of
narrative
by
the
state
which
is
subject
to
no
rules
of
evidence.
and
the
defendant
puts
on
no
evidence.
i
presume
that
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
helping
the
judge
in
sentence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that’s
true.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
perhaps
because
it
tends
to
i
suppose
you’re
suggesting
that
that
tends
to
establish
that
the
defendant
is
pleading
guilty
for
some
other
reason
and
because
of
the
unconstitutional
statutory
scheme.
is
that
what
you’re
suggesting?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
but
your
honor,
the
second-degree
murder
plea
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
prisoner
was
never
given
the
option
to
plead
not
guilty
the
second-degree
murder.
his
choice
always
was
between
risking
the
death
penalty
and
pleading
guilty.
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
plead
not
guilty
to
anything
but
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir
i
think
not.
i
think
what
the
defendant
is
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
must
establish
is
that
his
guilty
plea
was
a
result
of
the
coercive
effect
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
in
one
sense,
the
stronger
the
case
is,
the
case
for
the
state,
the
more
coerced
he
is.
because
the
more
fear
he
has
of
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that’s
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
this
is
what
the
defendant’s
attorney
continued
to
stress.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir.
that
statute
was
a
result
of
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit.
at
the
time
that
this
defendant
was
charged
he
could
plead
guilty
and
avoid
the
death
penalty.
the
north
carolina
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir.
i
think
it’s
the
rule
in
six
or
seven
states.
some
states
have
recently
changed
the
rule.
i
think
the
states
affected
are
about
eight.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
because
plead
bargaining
is
inherently
coercive
in
the
same
way
that
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme
or
capital
punishment
is
coercive.
there’s
a
vast
difference
in
degree
because
under
the
north
carolina
you
had
to
risk
your
life
in
order
to
plea
not
guilty
and
have
a
jury
trial.
normally,
in
plead
bargaining,
you’re
just
bargaining
for
a
number
of
years
and
not
for
your
life.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
suggest
that
that’s
a
possible
interpretation
of
united
states
v.
jackson.
i
see
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that
probably
if
the
defendant
is
in
fact
indicted
of
first-degree
murder
or
of
any
other
capital
crime
and
he
has
never
given
any
opportunity
to
plead
not
guilty
to
any
other
crime
other
than
the
capital
crime
then
other
jackson,
his
plea
is
coerced
by
the
unconstitutional
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir
but
he
was
only
given
the
opportunity
to
plead
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
he
could
never
plead
not
guilty
to
it
and
have
a
trial
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
i
think
it’s
unconstitutional
in
the
same
way
that
is
unconstitutional
if
you
let
him
plead
guilty
to
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
when
you
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
included
offense
then
that
puts
a
greater
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
plea
was
a
result
of
the
coercive
nature
of
the
statute.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
then
i
wouldn’t
have
a
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
difference
is
that
he
can
assert
his
right
to
have
a
trial
and
to
have
his
guilt
or
innocence
found
by
a
jury
and
still
not
risk
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
because
the
penalty
for
second-degree
murder
is
the
same
regardless
of
what
he
pleads
guilty
or
innocent?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
unconstitutional
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
but
under
the
first-degree
murder
statutes
that
they
stood
at
the
time
that
this
defendant
was
tried,
if
he
pleaded
not
guilty
he
got
the
death
penalty.
if
he
pleaded
guilty,
he
only
got
life
imprisonment.
and
what
i
understand
u.s.
v.
jackson
says
is
that
you
can’t
set
up
two
different
penalties
depending
on
whether
a
man
asserts
his
rights
to
a
trial
by
jury
or
whether
he
doesn’t.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
that’s
the
coercive
defense.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
it
did.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
that’s
true.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes
sir,
which
is
why
one
of
the
issues
now
is
retroactivity
of
that
decision.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
if
the
jackson
opinion
is
copmpletely
retroactive
then
you
would
be
coerced
in
any
event
or
he
would
be
presuming
to
be
coerced
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
some
sort
of
relief.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
dissent
in
jackson
took
the
position
that
i
think
you’re
getting
at
and
that
is
the
statute
should
not
be
declared
unconstitutional.
rather,
there
should
be
a
burden
on
the
court
to
determine
that
the
coercive
nature
of
the
statute
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
plea.
but
that
was
the
dissent
and
the
majority
in
jackson
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
setup
two
different
penalties
depending
on
whether
you
pleaded
guilty
or
innocent.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
thought
it
involved
both
whether
you
pleaded
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
whether
or
not
you
are
in
the
jury
trial.
in
north
carolina,
the
jury
trial
alone
cannot
be
waived.
you
have
to
waive
everything
or
nothing.
so
the
question
is
whether
you
plead
guilty
and
in
doing
so,
also
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
whether
you
plead
not
guilty.
the
north
carolina
statute
is
not
servable.
at
least
the
state
has
never
suggested
any
way
in
any
manner
which
it
could
be
servable
because
of
the
structure
of
the
statute.
the
statute
imposes
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
right
--
life,
excuse
me.
and
then
another
statute
sets
out
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
plea
--
to
plea
guilty
and
received
an
automatic
life
sentence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
jury
may
still
recommend
mercy
but
you
may
not
plead
guilty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
a
guilty
plea
covered
or
not
carried
an
automatic
life
imprisonment
sentence.
the
guilty
plea
was
treated
as
a
guilty
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
that
depends
on
whether
the
recent
case
of
pierce
against
--
north
carolina
against
pearce
applies.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
also
the
case
of
greene
against
united
states.
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
has
made
an
election.
the
charging
was
second-degree
murder
and
they
probably
precluded
from
retrial
for
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
if
he
is
only
--
there
is
a
problem.
now
if
he
has
no
--
if
he
can
plead
not
guilty
the
second
time
around
and
not
risk
the
death
penalty
then
i
think
he
can
also
plead
guilty.
because
then
he
would
just
--
he
would
have
the
same
exposure
either
way.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
and
if
he
had
ever
been
given
that
option
then
i
wouldn’t
have
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
as
long
--
well,
i
don’t
believe
the
court
said
it
would
be
presumed
to
be
coercive
in
this
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
pardon?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir
but
the
fourth
circuit
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
guilty
plea
was
coerced.
and
they
said
that
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
to
lesser
included
offenses.
then
he
has
a
greater
burden
to
show
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
coercive
effect
of
the
statutory
scheme.
so,
i
suppose
if
you
kept
going
down
under
the
fourth
circuit’s
rule,
then
at
some
point
the
coercive
effect
of
the
statute
would
lose
its
strength.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
fourth
circuit
put
the
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
right.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
if
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
true.
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
the
burden
was
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
in
fact
coerced
by
the
fear
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
i
suppose
that
if
he
is
truly
guilty
and
the
state
is
wiling
to
let
him
get
off
with
an
assault
charge
that
maybe
the
fear
of
the
death
penalty
really
wasn’t
the
motivating
force
in
his
pleading
guilty.
and
maybe
there
wasn’t
--
if
the
state
is
wiling
to
accept
that
lower
degree
of
the
included
offenses,
then
the
state
probably
don’t
have
a
very
good
case
for
obtaining
a
death
sentence.
i’d
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
in
all
of
its
--
in
most
of
its
decisions
on
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
a
constitutional
principle
has
established
that
in
any
case,
even
though
a
particular
constitutional
principle
is
declared
to
be
perspective
only
in
its
application.
any
defendant
who
cans
show
that
the
facts
of
his
case
actually
show
an
abuse
of
due
process
is
entitled
to
relief.
for
example
in
the
case
of
davis
against
north
carolina,
this
court
held
that
davis’
confession
was
in
fact
coerced
even
though
the
court
had
just
held
that
miranda
and
escobedo
were
not
retroactive
and
the
court
held
that
the
principles
established
in
miranda
and
escobedo
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
jackson’s
coerced
confession
was
in
fact
coerced.
now
this
is
a
case
of
a
coerced
guilty
plea
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
laid
down
by
the
court
in
united
states
v.
jackson
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
guilty
plea
was
in
fact
coerced.
and
in
this
record,
it
seems
to
be
no
other
conclusion
one
can
reach
then
that
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
in
order
to
escape
the
death
penalty.
he
has
never,
this
is
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
ever
admitted
his
guilt
to
anyone
not
even
his
attorney.
his
attorney
testified
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
the
defendant
always
said
that
he
was
innocent
but
that
he
would
plead
guilty
in
order
to
avoid
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
but
i
point
out
that
that
is
only
what
the
state
says
it
has
as
evidence.
the
woman
was
not
at
the
trial.
it
was
no
--
there
was
no
evidence
as
such.
he
was
never
given
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i’m
not
sure
that
the
defendant
has
any
right
to
refute
it.
i
think
that
the
procedure
is
that
the
state
simply
narrates
its
--
what
it
contends
as
its
evidence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes
and
after
the
narration,
the
defendant
said
i
am
not
guilty.
i
didn’t
kill
no
man
and
i’m
only
pleading
guilty
because
they
told
they
were
going
to
ask
me
if
i
didn’t.
and
the
record
shows
that
it
took
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
ever
to
get
him
to
plead
guilty
that
it
was
--
that
his
attorney
approached
his
sister
and
his
cousin
who
was
a
policeman
and
that
they
prevailed
upon
him
to
plead
guilty
because
the
attorney
said
he
couldn’t
win
the
case
and
because
the
attorney
said
that
the
facts
were
aggravated
because
he’d
been
out
with
the
white
woman
just
before
the
murder.
i’d
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
retroactive
effect
of
united
states
v.
jackson.
the
principles
which
this
court
has
set
out
in
determining
retroactivity
are
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
standards
the
effect
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officials
and
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
retroactivity
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now
in
--
one
of
the
more
recent
cases
on
this
subject
desist
against
united
states,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
constitutional
rule
is
paramount
and
that
only
if
the
purpose
and
this
is
not
clearly
dictate
retroactivity
or
non-retroactivity
do
you
go
to
the
second,
and
third
points
the
reliance
factor
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now
in
this
case,
under
north
carolina
law,
in
order
to
avoid
the
coercive
nature
of
the
capital
punishment
provisions
of
the
statutes,
you
have
to
plead
guilty.
you
may
not
have
a
bench
trial.
you
have
no
choice
but
to
completely
waive
your
right
to
a
trial
at
all
which
means
if
you
waive
your
right
to
a
trial,
you
waive
your
right
to
have
your
guilt
proven
by
the
state.
you
wave
your
right
to
cross-examine
and
confront
your
witnesses.
you
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
if
the
fact
is
to
considered
in
determining
on
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
principle
is
retroactive
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
a
fair
trial,
and
whether
or
not
the
new
constitutional
principle
really
purifies
the
fact-finding
process
of
the
court.
now
if
the
right
of
counsel
is
important
enough
to
be
retroactivity,
then
surely
the
right
to
any
trial
at
all
is
important
now.
and
its
very
possible,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
situation
where
a
man
with
the
first
grade
education
is
told
by
his
attorney
that
he
can’t
win
the
case
and
that
the
facts
are
aggravated
and
the
jury
are
therefore
not
going
to
be
favorable
towards
his
position,
that
he
may
very
well
plead
guilty
when
in
fact
he
is
innocent
because
he
is
being
force
to
gamble
with
his
life.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
real
possibility
of
a
danger
of
an
innocent
person
being
convicted
under
this
sort
of
coercive
statutes.

prior
consideration
of
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
procedure
in
north
carolina
upon
tender
of
guilty
plea
is
that
the
state
in
narrative
form
presents
what
it
contends
is
its
evidence.
but
it’s
a
hearsay
sort
of
narrative
by
the
state
which
is
subject
to
no
rules
of
evidence.
and
the
defendant
puts
on
no
evidence.
i
presume
that
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
helping
the
judge
in
sentence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that’s
true.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
perhaps
because
it
tends
to
i
suppose
you’re
suggesting
that
that
tends
to
establish
that
the
defendant
is
pleading
guilty
for
some
other
reason
and
because
of
the
unconstitutional
statutory
scheme.
is
that
what
you’re
suggesting?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
but
your
honor,
the
second-degree
murder
plea
was
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
prisoner
was
never
given
the
option
to
plead
not
guilty
the
second-degree
murder.
his
choice
always
was
between
risking
the
death
penalty
and
pleading
guilty.
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
plead
not
guilty
to
anything
but
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir
i
think
not.
i
think
what
the
defendant
is
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
must
establish
is
that
his
guilty
plea
was
a
result
of
the
coercive
effect
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
in
one
sense,
the
stronger
the
case
is,
the
case
for
the
state,
the
more
coerced
he
is.
because
the
more
fear
he
has
of
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that’s
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
this
is
what
the
defendant’s
attorney
continued
to
stress.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir.
that
statute
was
a
result
of
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit.
at
the
time
that
this
defendant
was
charged
he
could
plead
guilty
and
avoid
the
death
penalty.
the
north
carolina
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
sir.
i
think
it’s
the
rule
in
six
or
seven
states.
some
states
have
recently
changed
the
rule.
i
think
the
states
affected
are
about
eight.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
because
plead
bargaining
is
inherently
coercive
in
the
same
way
that
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme
or
capital
punishment
is
coercive.
there’s
a
vast
difference
in
degree
because
under
the
north
carolina
you
had
to
risk
your
life
in
order
to
plea
not
guilty
and
have
a
jury
trial.
normally,
in
plead
bargaining,
you’re
just
bargaining
for
a
number
of
years
and
not
for
your
life.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
suggest
that
that’s
a
possible
interpretation
of
united
states
v.
jackson.
i
see
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
think
that
probably
if
the
defendant
is
in
fact
indicted
of
first-degree
murder
or
of
any
other
capital
crime
and
he
has
never
given
any
opportunity
to
plead
not
guilty
to
any
other
crime
other
than
the
capital
crime
then
other
jackson,
his
plea
is
coerced
by
the
unconstitutional
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir
but
he
was
only
given
the
opportunity
to
plead
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
he
could
never
plead
not
guilty
to
it
and
have
a
trial
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
i
think
it’s
unconstitutional
in
the
same
way
that
is
unconstitutional
if
you
let
him
plead
guilty
to
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
when
you
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
included
offense
then
that
puts
a
greater
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
plea
was
a
result
of
the
coercive
nature
of
the
statute.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
then
i
wouldn’t
have
a
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
difference
is
that
he
can
assert
his
right
to
have
a
trial
and
to
have
his
guilt
or
innocence
found
by
a
jury
and
still
not
risk
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
because
the
penalty
for
second-degree
murder
is
the
same
regardless
of
what
he
pleads
guilty
or
innocent?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
unconstitutional
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
but
under
the
first-degree
murder
statutes
that
they
stood
at
the
time
that
this
defendant
was
tried,
if
he
pleaded
not
guilty
he
got
the
death
penalty.
if
he
pleaded
guilty,
he
only
got
life
imprisonment.
and
what
i
understand
u.s.
v.
jackson
says
is
that
you
can’t
set
up
two
different
penalties
depending
on
whether
a
man
asserts
his
rights
to
a
trial
by
jury
or
whether
he
doesn’t.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
that’s
the
coercive
defense.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
no,
it
did.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
that’s
true.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes
sir,
which
is
why
one
of
the
issues
now
is
retroactivity
of
that
decision.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
if
the
jackson
opinion
is
copmpletely
retroactive
then
you
would
be
coerced
in
any
event
or
he
would
be
presuming
to
be
coerced
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
some
sort
of
relief.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
dissent
in
jackson
took
the
position
that
i
think
you’re
getting
at
and
that
is
the
statute
should
not
be
declared
unconstitutional.
rather,
there
should
be
a
burden
on
the
court
to
determine
that
the
coercive
nature
of
the
statute
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
plea.
but
that
was
the
dissent
and
the
majority
in
jackson
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
setup
two
different
penalties
depending
on
whether
you
pleaded
guilty
or
innocent.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i
thought
it
involved
both
whether
you
pleaded
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
whether
or
not
you
are
in
the
jury
trial.
in
north
carolina,
the
jury
trial
alone
cannot
be
waived.
you
have
to
waive
everything
or
nothing.
so
the
question
is
whether
you
plead
guilty
and
in
doing
so,
also
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
whether
you
plead
not
guilty.
the
north
carolina
statute
is
not
servable.
at
least
the
state
has
never
suggested
any
way
in
any
manner
which
it
could
be
servable
because
of
the
structure
of
the
statute.
the
statute
imposes
death
unless
the
jury
recommends
right
--
life,
excuse
me.
and
then
another
statute
sets
out
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
plea
--
to
plea
guilty
and
received
an
automatic
life
sentence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
unless
the
jury
recommends
mercy.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
jury
may
still
recommend
mercy
but
you
may
not
plead
guilty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
a
guilty
plea
covered
or
not
carried
an
automatic
life
imprisonment
sentence.
the
guilty
plea
was
treated
as
a
guilty
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
that
depends
on
whether
the
recent
case
of
pierce
against
--
north
carolina
against
pearce
applies.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
and
also
the
case
of
greene
against
united
states.
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
has
made
an
election.
the
charging
was
second-degree
murder
and
they
probably
precluded
from
retrial
for
first-degree
murder.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
well,
if
he
is
only
--
there
is
a
problem.
now
if
he
has
no
--
if
he
can
plead
not
guilty
the
second
time
around
and
not
risk
the
death
penalty
then
i
think
he
can
also
plead
guilty.
because
then
he
would
just
--
he
would
have
the
same
exposure
either
way.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
and
if
he
had
ever
been
given
that
option
then
i
wouldn’t
have
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
as
long
--
well,
i
don’t
believe
the
court
said
it
would
be
presumed
to
be
coercive
in
this
case.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
pardon?
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir
but
the
fourth
circuit
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
this
guilty
plea
was
coerced.
and
they
said
that
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
to
lesser
included
offenses.
then
he
has
a
greater
burden
to
show
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
coercive
effect
of
the
statutory
scheme.
so,
i
suppose
if
you
kept
going
down
under
the
fourth
circuit’s
rule,
then
at
some
point
the
coercive
effect
of
the
statute
would
lose
its
strength.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
the
fourth
circuit
put
the
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
right.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
if
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
true.
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
the
burden
was
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
guilty
plea
was
in
fact
coerced
by
the
fear
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
i
suppose
that
if
he
is
truly
guilty
and
the
state
is
wiling
to
let
him
get
off
with
an
assault
charge
that
maybe
the
fear
of
the
death
penalty
really
wasn’t
the
motivating
force
in
his
pleading
guilty.
and
maybe
there
wasn’t
--
if
the
state
is
wiling
to
accept
that
lower
degree
of
the
included
offenses,
then
the
state
probably
don’t
have
a
very
good
case
for
obtaining
a
death
sentence.
i’d
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
in
all
of
its
--
in
most
of
its
decisions
on
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
a
constitutional
principle
has
established
that
in
any
case,
even
though
a
particular
constitutional
principle
is
declared
to
be
perspective
only
in
its
application.
any
defendant
who
cans
show
that
the
facts
of
his
case
actually
show
an
abuse
of
due
process
is
entitled
to
relief.
for
example
in
the
case
of
davis
against
north
carolina,
this
court
held
that
davis’
confession
was
in
fact
coerced
even
though
the
court
had
just
held
that
miranda
and
escobedo
were
not
retroactive
and
the
court
held
that
the
principles
established
in
miranda
and
escobedo
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
jackson’s
coerced
confession
was
in
fact
coerced.
now
this
is
a
case
of
a
coerced
guilty
plea
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
laid
down
by
the
court
in
united
states
v.
jackson
is
relevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
guilty
plea
was
in
fact
coerced.
and
in
this
record,
it
seems
to
be
no
other
conclusion
one
can
reach
then
that
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
in
order
to
escape
the
death
penalty.
he
has
never,
this
is
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
ever
admitted
his
guilt
to
anyone
not
even
his
attorney.
his
attorney
testified
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
the
defendant
always
said
that
he
was
innocent
but
that
he
would
plead
guilty
in
order
to
avoid
the
death
penalty.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
but
i
point
out
that
that
is
only
what
the
state
says
it
has
as
evidence.
the
woman
was
not
at
the
trial.
it
was
no
--
there
was
no
evidence
as
such.
he
was
never
given
--
ms.
doris
r.
bray
i’m
not
sure
that
the
defendant
has
any
right
to
refute
it.
i
think
that
the
procedure
is
that
the
state
simply
narrates
its
--
what
it
contends
as
its
evidence.
ms.
doris
r.
bray
yes
and
after
the
narration,
the
defendant
said
i
am
not
guilty.
i
didn’t
kill
no
man
and
i’m
only
pleading
guilty
because
they
told
they
were
going
to
ask
me
if
i
didn’t.
and
the
record
shows
that
it
took
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
ever
to
get
him
to
plead
guilty
that
it
was
--
that
his
attorney
approached
his
sister
and
his
cousin
who
was
a
policeman
and
that
they
prevailed
upon
him
to
plead
guilty
because
the
attorney
said
he
couldn’t
win
the
case
and
because
the
attorney
said
that
the
facts
were
aggravated
because
he’d
been
out
with
the
white
woman
just
before
the
murder.
i’d
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
retroactive
effect
of
united
states
v.
jackson.
the
principles
which
this
court
has
set
out
in
determining
retroactivity
are
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
standards
the
effect
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officials
and
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
retroactivity
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now
in
--
one
of
the
more
recent
cases
on
this
subject
desist
against
united
states,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
constitutional
rule
is
paramount
and
that
only
if
the
purpose
and
this
is
not
clearly
dictate
retroactivity
or
non-retroactivity
do
you
go
to
the
second,
and
third
points
the
reliance
factor
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now
in
this
case,
under
north
carolina
law,
in
order
to
avoid
the
coercive
nature
of
the
capital
punishment
provisions
of
the
statutes,
you
have
to
plead
guilty.
you
may
not
have
a
bench
trial.
you
have
no
choice
but
to
completely
waive
your
right
to
a
trial
at
all
which
means
if
you
waive
your
right
to
a
trial,
you
waive
your
right
to
have
your
guilt
proven
by
the
state.
you
wave
your
right
to
cross-examine
and
confront
your
witnesses.
you
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
if
the
fact
is
to
considered
in
determining
on
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
principle
is
retroactive
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
a
fair
trial,
and
whether
or
not
the
new
constitutional
principle
really
purifies
the
fact-finding
process
of
the
court.
now
if
the
right
of
counsel
is
important
enough
to
be
retroactivity,
then
surely
the
right
to
any
trial
at
all
is
important
now.
and
its
very
possible,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
situation
where
a
man
with
the
first
grade
education
is
told
by
his
attorney
that
he
can’t
win
the
case
and
that
the
facts
are
aggravated
and
the
jury
are
therefore
not
going
to
be
favorable
towards
his
position,
that
he
may
very
well
plead
guilty
when
in
fact
he
is
innocent
because
he
is
being
force
to
gamble
with
his
life.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
real
possibility
of
a
danger
of
an
innocent
person
being
convicted
under
this
sort
of
coercive
statutes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
