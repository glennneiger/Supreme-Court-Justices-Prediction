justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
for
me
its
own
place
its
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
first-degree
indictment
and
then
withdrawn
in
the
second-degree
indictment
have
been
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
think
you
misunderstood
it.
the
person
indicted
to
first-degree
murder
they
can’t
bargain
so
they
withdraw
the
first-degree
indictment
and
put
in
the
second-degree
indictment.
and
he
pleads
guilty
to
the
second-degree
indictment
and
you
said
that’s
alright.
justice

that
would
be
alright?
justice
