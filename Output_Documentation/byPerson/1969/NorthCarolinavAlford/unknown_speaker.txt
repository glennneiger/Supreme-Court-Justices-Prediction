unknown
speaker
let
me
get
that
right
statement.
do
you
say
the
first-degree
murder
carried
on
a
life
sentence?
unknown
speaker
oh,
upon
a
plea
of
guilty.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
a
--
if
there
was
here
a
guilty
plea,
i
don’t
quite
see
why
there
was
a
trial
transcript.
generally,
if
there’s
a
guilty
plea,
there’s
no
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
use
for
north
carolina
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
after
a
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
can
a
defendant
in
--
if
he
pleads
guilty
--
unknown
speaker
i
say,
can
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
in
north
carolina
appeal
from
the
judgment
entered
upon
his
plea
of
guilty?
unknown
speaker
but
that
--
if
by
statute
is
there
an
appeal?
i’m
not
talking
about
collateral
attack.
unknown
speaker
is
the
appellate
--
does
your
supreme
court
ruled
on
it?
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
appeal?
unknown
speaker
i’m
talking
about
that
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
reference?
eight?
did
you
say
eight
capital
cases?
unknown
speaker
since
1850?
unknown
speaker
what
punishment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
safron,
to
go
back
to
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
to
the
effect
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
used
this
case
a
vehicle
by
which
to
completely
strike
down
and
invalidate
the
procedures
for
capital
punishment
into
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
haven’t
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
just
thought
they’d
reverse
the
conviction
in
this
case
because
they
found
that
it
was
involuntary?
unknown
speaker
am
i
mistaken?
unknown
speaker
where
i
have
the
appendix,
what
page?
i
missed
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
or
i
didn’t
understand
that
this
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
be
automatic
in
every
case.
i
thought
it
said
that
if
something
was
the
primary
or
major
factor
in
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
your
--
how
does
the
court
of
appeals
--
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
saying
here
that
this
kind
of
pleas
is
in
doubt?
unknown
speaker
you
think?
unknown
speaker
that’s
kind
of
--
maybe
you
didn’t
understand.
the
north
carolina
court
has
repealed
some
statutes.
unknown
speaker
or
its
legislature
repealed
some
statutes.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
decision’s
stand
would
the
state
rely
on
the
plea
in
a
case
just
like
this
one
in
the
future.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
--
in
spite
of
the
repeal
of
your
statutes,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
–
or
an
opinion
would
still
apply
in
a
case
like
this.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
quite
understand
what
you
are
arguing?
i
understand
you
to
stay
that
the
coercion
years
and
the
fact
that
a
man
charged
with
murder
is
not
allowed
to
plead
guilty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
what
is
said
to
be
coercive?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
rule
in
every
state
in
the
union?
unknown
speaker
but
it’s
not
what
this
court
held?
as
i
understand,
what
has
been
held
is
that
when
a
crime
is
charged
there
can
be
lower
crimes
involved.
and
that
went
for
such
a
murder
in
the
first-degree,
murder
in
the
second,
manslaughter,
manslaughter
in
the
second,
assault
and
battery,
that
anything,
when
there’s
any
plea
you’re
in,
they
need
the
first
degree.
that
that’s
automatically
coercive
in
such
a
law
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
what
he
was
given
and
pleaded
second
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
in
some
constitutional
unless
a
defendant
if
a
man
is
charged
with
first-degree
murder,
it’s
unconstitutional;
let
him
plead
guilty
to
any
other
offense
because
it’s
coercive?
lesser
i
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
didn’t
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you’ve
in
a
sentence
in
so
far
as
the
sentence
can
do
so
have
described
the
whole
thing
in
the
jackson
case
but
the
jackson
case
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
plea,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
it
deal
with
the
--
it
had
to
deal
with
putting
a
penalty
on
a
person
who
exercise
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
it
had
nothing
to
do
and
that
was
decided
on
a
motion
that
is
there
had
been
no
trial,
there
had
been
no
plea.
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
make
your
argument,
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
wasn’t
quite
true.
if
i
can
with
respect
make
at
least
a
slight
correction.
it
didn’t
have
to
do
whether
or
not
she
pleaded
guilty
or
innocent.
it
had
to
do
about
with
whether
or
not
you
ask
for
a
jury
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
federal
statute
you
could
have
had
a
bench
trial
pleading.
pleading
not
guilty
and
the
federal
statute
involved
in
jackson
and
the
statute
was
not
held
unconstitutional
only
one
part
of
the
way,
the
death
penalty
part.
because
that
death
penalty
was
put
on
as
a
punishment
for
anybody
who
exercised
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
the
holding
in
jackson
simply
was
at
that
part
of
the
federal
statute
was
unconstitutional.
and
only
that
part
that
provided
for
a
death
penalty,
it
didn’t
involve
anybody
who
had
pleaded
either
guilty
or
not
guilty
because
that
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
and
the
district
court
had
held
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional.
we
reversed
that
holding
and
held
simply
that
the
death
sentence
part
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
but
it
didn’t
involve
pleading
guilty
or
not
guilty.
it
involves
simply
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
am
i
wrong
in
my
recollection
of
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mrs.
bray.
if
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
stands
i
gather,
alford
has
to
be
retried?
unknown
speaker
and
do
i
understand
that
if
he’s
found
guilty
under
the
present
sentencing
statute
in
north
carolina,
he
automatically
gets
the
death
penalty?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
minute
that’s
what
i
thought
that
power
to
recommend
mercy
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
on
the
retrial
if
the
jury
doesn’t
recommend
mercy
then
this
is
rather
pure
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
now
we
couldn’t
--
if
this
court
is
right,
he
could
not
plead
guilty
the
second-degree
murder
again,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
on
a
second-degree
charge?
unknown
speaker
is
that
we’re
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
under
the
court’s
opinion,
he
couldn’t
--
couldn’t
he
be
tired
for
manslaughter?
he
couldn’t
even
plead
guilty
to
manslaughter
if
we
presume
to
be
coercive?
unknown
speaker
they
said
it
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
they
just
said
he
wouldn’t
be,
didn’t
they
and
so
decide.
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
you
figure
that
one?
unknown
speaker
yes,
he
is
trying
to
get
away
from
the
jury
trial
to
be
--
unknown
speaker
maybe
behind?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
see
what
degree
you
would
have
to
answer
whether
it’s
manslaughter
or
if
it
is
in
that
state
he
could
be
tried
in
alabama.
he
can
be
tried
for
assault,
convicted
also
or
assault
and
battery,
arson
and
assault.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
true
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
that
right
statement.
do
you
say
the
first-degree
murder
carried
on
a

unknown
