well,
in
every
state
in
the
union,
i
suppose
plea
bargaining
is
not
unknown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that
--
so
that
extends
here
the
answer
to
my
brother
black’s
question
would
be
yes.
just
as
a
generality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
if
we
should
accept
your
argument
at
which
is
the
--
which
is
also
the
basis
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
logical
result
would
be
would
it
not
to
find
that
in
every
case
where
there
was
plead
bargaining
you
would
have
to
find
that
there
had
been
a
coerced
plea
of
guilty?
that’s
what
i
understood
you
to
suggest.
