mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
upon
direct
appeal
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
opinion
of
that
court
from
the
divided
opinion.
chief
justice
haynesworth
dissenting
holding
that
statutory
scheme
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
in
north
carolina
in
light
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
united
states
v.
jackson
is
unconstitutional.
therefore,
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
the
import
and
impact
of
the
jackson
opinion
upon
the
laws
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
the
laws
of
our
sister
states
and
of
the
federal
judiciary.
on
the
evening
of
november
22,
1963,
nathaniel
young,
a
negro
gentleman
who
operated
a
house
that
could
best
be
described
as
a
party
house
in
the
city
of
winston-salem,
north
carolina
opened
--
responded
to
a
knock
at
the
door,
opened
the
door
slightly
and
was
cut
down
by
a
shotgun
blast.
earlier
that
evening,
petitioner
or
actually
the
appellee
in
this
case
henry
c.
alford,
had
come
to
that
house.
henry
alford
also
is
negro.
he
had
been
accompanied
by
a
white
girl.
they
purchased
several
drinks
of
liquor
by
the
drink
which
under
north
carolina
prohibition
board
--
prohibition
laws
is
not
legal.
and
then
henry
alford
gave
nathaniel
young
his
last
dollar
to
rent
a
room
in
that
house.
alford
was
accompanied
by
his
girlfriend
into
that
room
and
after
several
minutes,
they
left
because
henry
alford
no
longer
had
any
money.
he
demanded
that
this
young
lady
leave
with
him.
daniel
young,
the
proprietor
of
this
house
said,
“she
could
stay
here
if
she
wishes.”
an
argument
ensued
and
henry
alford
run
off
with
the
lady’s
coat
being
chased
by
nathaniel
young
and
someone
else.
approximately,
15
to
20
minutes
later,
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
nathaniel
young
was
cut
down
by
a
shotgun
blast.
alford
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
the
white
county
superior
court
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
counsel
was
appointed.
counsel
thoroughly
investigated
the
case.
counsel
contacted
every
witness
named
to
him
by
henry
alford
except
one
by
name
of
jack
who
cannot
be
found.
in
each
case,
the
testimony
of
alford’s
purported
witnesses
was
contrary
to
alford’s
allegations
as
to
their
testimony.
upon
the
call
of
the
case,
alford
through
counsel
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
which
under
north
carolina
law
carries
a
maximum
punishment
of
30
years
imprisonment.
he
did
not
plead
guilty
to
the
capital
offense
which
under
the
law
been
in
state
would
have
carried
a
life
sentence.
he
pled
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
the
state
then
placed
on
the
stand.
the
detective
e.
i.
weatherman
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
upon
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
upon
a
plan
of
guilty.
it
would
carry
a
penalty
of
life.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
alford
pled
guilty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
which
carries
at
a
maximum,
a
sentence
of
30
years.
the
state
placed
on
the
stand
after
the
tender
of
the
plea,
officer
weatherman,
now
if
the
court
please,
i’m
not
sure
whether
or
not
you
--
this
court
has
a
copy
of
the
actual
trial
transcript
in
that
case.
i
have
a
copy
here
which
i’d
like
to
file
with
the
court
if
the
trial
transcript
is
not
included.
unfortunate
--
the
appendix
does
not
include
the
entire
trial
transcript.
it
does
not
include
the
testimony
of
the
officer
and
other
witnesses.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
that’s
true
your
honor.
however,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
court
of
the
evidence
and
also
to
give
the
court
an
opportunity
to
judge
the
nature
of
the
crime
for
the
purpose
of
sentencing,
evidence
was
presented.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
the
judges
presiding
at
the
trials
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened.
now,
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
plea,
counsel
obtained
this
affidavit.
the
defendant,
henry
c.
alford
after
being
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
not
sure
if
this
is
in
the
record
or
not,
your
honor.
i
like
to
submit
a
copy
of
this
also.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i’d
like
to
show
what
happened
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
plea
your
honor
because
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
was
filed
as
part
of
the
post-conviction
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
of
white
county.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
this
has
gone
on
and
on,
your
honor,
i’ll
describe
the
rooting
in
my
argument.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
this
is
part
of
the
original
post-conviction
proceeding.
that
attorney
fred
g.
crumpler
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
defendant
has
conferred
with
the
defendant
on
numerous
occasions.
in
addition
to
this,
this
attorney
has
consulted
on
numerous
occasions
with
me
in
the
presence
of
my
sister
and
various
friends
in
preparation
for
the
trial
of
this
case.
this
attorney
has
advised
me
that
i’m
charged
with
a
capital
crime
and
if
i
plead
not
guilty,
the
possible
verdicts
of
the
jury
including
the
right
of
the
jury
to
find
me
not
guilty.
he
has
also
advised
me
that
if
i’m
convicted
with
first-degree
murder,
the
law
provides
for
mandatory
life
sentence
of
imprisonment
if
the
jury
recommends
mercy,
or
in
mandatory
death
penalty,
if
the
jury
does
not
recommend
mercy.
he
has
also
advised
me
of
my
rights
of
appeal
in
all
events
including
the
final
right
of
appeal
for
mercy
before
the
governor
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
i
hereby
authorized
attorney
fred
g.
crumpler
to
tender
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
offense
of
second-degree
murder
to
the
court
which
decision
is
in
my
own
freewill,
made
in
the
presence
of
my
sister
and
friends
who
are
also
present
during
the
consultation
with
said
attorney.
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
attorney
is
able,
experienced,
and
competent.
the
above
affidavit
has
been
both
read
by
me
and
to
me
by
the
undersigned
officer
of
the
court
and
it
was
read
to
the
defendant
and
signed
in
the
presence
of
r.b.
hoskins,
deputy
clerk
of
the
superior
court
of
white
county.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
counsel
as
this
court
is
well
aware
is
constantly
under
attacked
nowadays.
part
of
this,
i
submit
is
counsel’s
protection
of
himself
and
of
course,
this
is
also
a
written
authorization
to
counsel
to
enter
the
plea
on
his
client’s
behalf.
to
show
that
the
plea
was
authorized,
perhaps
an
expectation
of
the
boykin
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
in
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
this
was
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--
part
of
the
counsel’s
private
records
but
then
was
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
that’s
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
assume
it’s
with
the
original
records
which
have
been
transmitted
to
this
court
as
the
record
has
been
built
up.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
footnoted
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’d
like
to
read
to
the
court
some
transcripts
--
some
excerpts
from
the
original
trial
transcript
to
show
the
court
the
taste
the
state
have
against
this
defendant.
we
then
contacted
ruby
mcgill
where
alford
had
been
living
and
ruby,
as
a
consequence
of
an
interview
with
her,
said
that
she
and
henry
have
been
living
together
for
some
three
years
that
they
were
at
this
address
about
five
months.
so
henry
left
around
dark
stating
that
he’ll
be
back
for
a
few
minutes.
that
about
two-and-a-half
to
three
hours
later,
he
came
back
and
stated
that
he
was
breathing
hard,
appearing
to
have
been
running
and
stated,
“g.d.s.o.b.
has
been
running
me,
i’m
going
to
kill
him.”
she
stated
that
at
that
time,
he
said
“nathaniel
young”
and
that
he
kept
and
he
repeated
that
a
couple
or
three
times
that
he
was
going
back
and
kill
the
s.o.b.
and
the
other
fellow
with
him
also.
she
stated
that
he
got
a
shotgun
out
of
the
wardrobe
and
four
shells.
that
she
and
shirley,
it’s
another
woman
who
was
there
at
the
time,
asked
him
not
to.
they
told
him
that
there
were
no
use
in
that
and
said
that
he
kept
repeating
that
he
was
going
back
and
went
out
the
door.
we
talked
to
betty
jeanne
robinson
who
stated
that
she
was
on
the
porch
of
the
store
at
1202,
10
1/2
street
which
is
little
better
about
half
a
block
from
the
home,
the
direction
of
nathaniel
young’s
home.
and
she
stated
that
she
and
paul
hill,
was
standing
on
the
porch
and
henry
c.
alford
came
by
them
with
a
gun.
in
her
statement
to
us,
ruby
mcgill
stated
that
after
he
left
with
a
gun
that
he
came
back
and
approximately
30
to
35
minutes
and
stated
that
--
said,
“honey,
if
i
don’t
kill
that
nathaniel,
i’m
going
to
leave
you
with
the
furniture.”
she
said,
“you
don’t
have
no
business
killing
any
man.”
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
killed
that
g.d.s.o.b.
i’m
not
going
to
have
anyone
to
kill
me.
i
went
to
the
door
and
when
i
shot
him,
he
just
turned
his
head
around
and
fell
on
the
floor.”
officers’
testimony
continues,
while
we
was
attempting
to
pickup
alford
in
regard
to
this,
we
went
to
the
home
of
sidney
lucky
who
leaves
down
a
couple
of
houses
across
the
street
and
we
first
went
to
his
house
around
11
o’clock
and
asked
him
if
henry
had
been
there.
he
said,
after
waking
him
said
that
he
had
come
in
there
and
told
him
if
the
officers
come
looking
for
me,
tell
them
i
haven’t
been
here.
and
i
talked
with
sidney
later
and
he
stated,
that
after
we
left,
he
went
out
and
found
alford
and
asked
him
why
we
was
looking
for
him
and
he
told
him
he
shot
a
man.
and
the
testimony
continues
here
with
another
witness
that
they
found,
a
young
lady
with
whom
alford
had
drinks
later
that
evening.
and
that
they
went
out
and
he
bought
her
two
drinks
of
whiskey
which
he
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
that
he
asked
her
for
her
address
and
her
full
name.
he
stated
that
he
had
shot
a
man
that
he’d
be
gone
a
long
time.
and
the
testimony
goes
on
and
on,
and
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
part
of
--
this
is
the
original
trial
transcript,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
on
the
plea
of
guilty.
prior
to
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
subsequent
to
its
tender
and
the
officer
concluded
his
testimony,
“and
the
gun
in
my
opinion
smelled
as
if
it
had
been
recently
fired.”
it
was
also
presented
that
this
original
hearing
upon
the
tender
of
the
guilty
plea,
the
testimony
of
shirley
wright,
who
was
the
young
lady’s
girlfriend
who
was
in
the
house
at
the
time.
and
she
states,
“after
he
came
in
and
got
the
gun,
i
left.”
well,
i’ll
describe
exactly
what
happened
when
he
came
to
get
the
gun.
well,
when
he
come
and
got
the
gun,
i
had
--
went
to
bathroom
and
i
come
out
and
he
had
got
the
gun.
you
know
and
he
said,
“i’m
going
to
kill
that
blank.”
so
he
didn’t
say
who
and
i
didn’t
ask
him.
i
just
told
him,
“no,
you
know,
don’t
do
it”
that’s
all
he
said
to
me.
so
this
was
what
was
tendered
to
the
court
by
the
detective
at
the
time
of
henry
c.
alford’s
tender
of
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
he
then
took
the
stand
himself.
and
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
the
night
that
he
--
he
have
not
shot
no
man.
but
there
from
the
circumstances
they
say,
“i’m
guilty.”
he
was
sentenced
to
30
years
in
prison.
approximately
three
months
later
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
but
remanded
the
case
to
the
superior
court
of
white
county
for
a
plenary
hearing
under
the
north
carolina
post-conviction
hearing
at.
in
due
course,
with
court-appointed
counsel,
the
hearing
was
held.
and
the
post-conviction
judge
found
that
the
tender
of
the
plea
was
really
involuntarily
made.
several
weeks
later,
alford
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
with
the
clerk
of
white
county
superior
court.
the
purpose
of
which,
i’m
really
not
sure
and
that
was
denied.
the
next
step
was
the
filing
of
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
clerk
of
united
states
district
court
from
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina.
the
court
dismissed
the
petition
at
that
time
because
alford
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
but
within
a
week
or
two
he
was
transferred
to
a
prison
unit
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
and
the
court
reinstated
the
application.
subsequently,
the
honorable
eugene
gordon,
united
states
district
court
judge
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
entered
an
opinion
denying
habeas
relief.
forty-eight
days
after
the
entry
of
judge
gordon’s
order
alford
filed
notice
of
appeal.
he
also
filed
an
additional
writ
of
habeas
corpus
directly
with
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
a
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
due
to
the
late
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
but
that
in
additional
application
for
habeas
corpus
had
been
filed
originally
in
that
court
and
chief
justice
haynesworth
of
the
fourth
circuit
entered
an
order
concluding
upon
the
original
application
of
that
court
that
alford’s
plea
of
guilty
was
really
voluntarily
and
understandingly
entered.
alford
subsequently
filed
yet
another
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
united
states
court
--
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
and
judge
gordon
once
again
reviewed
his
contentions
and
denied
relief.
from
that
denial,
alford
once
again
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
application
concluded
that
the
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
was
unconstitutional
in
light
of
the
united
states
v.
jackson,
the
jackson
decision
having
been
decided
in
the
interim
between
judge
gordon’s
denial
of
habeas
relief
and
the
filing
of
the
appeal.
until
1949,
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
upon
a
conviction
of
a
capital
crime,
the
four
capital
crimes
are
murder,
rape,
arson,
and
first-degree
burglary,
the
death
penalty
was
automatically
imposed.
in
1949,
the
legislature
amended
these
various
acts
to
permit
a
jury
to
recommend
mercy.
and
upon
that
recommendation,
the
defendant
would
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
in
1953,
yet
another
statute
was
passed
15-161
which
provided
that
upon
the
tender
of
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
crime,
in
writing
and
represented
by
counsel.
if
that
tender
is
accepted
by
the
solicitor
of
the
state
and
approved
by
the
court,
then
life
imprisonment
would
be
mandatorily
imposed.
in
view
of
that
scheme,
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
in
light
of
jackson
that
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme
was
invalid
and
held
that
alford
who
have
tendered
a
plea
to
second-degree
murder
was
coerced.
early
this
year,
the
legislator
of
north
carolina
repealed
n.c.g.s.
15-162.1,
the
provision
permitting
the
entry
of
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
offense.
it
is
of
interests
to
note
at
the
present
time
in
north
carolina,
there
are
11
defendants
under
sentence
of
death.
these
11
commenced
from
sentences
of
death
initially
imposed
in
february
of
1963
to
the
present.
from
february
of
1963
to
march
of
this
year,
prior
to
the
repeal
of
the
statute
there
are
six
defendants
under
sentence
of
death.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
it
happens
in
just
about
every
case
nowadays.
a
guilty
plea
as
you
are
well
aware
hardly
stops
of
the
appellate
procedures.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
had
not
in
capital
cases
yet.
but
in
the
typical
guilty
plea
situation
our
office
is
inundated
with
direct
appeals
from
guilty
pleas.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
--
as
i
say
in
this
capital
situation
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
not
familiar
with
their
ruling.
but
we
have
had
innumerable
situations.
each
week
we
are
flooded
with
appeals
which
are
noted
from
guilty
pleas.
so
i
would
assume
due
to
the
vast
volume
of
these
appeals
that
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
what
i
said
was
this.
since
february
of
1963
in
11
instances,
juries
have
refused
to
recommend
mercy.
of
these
11,
six
were
for
the
time
period
between
february
of
1963
through
march
of
this
year
subsequent
to
the
repeal
of
the
statute
permitting
a
capital
defendant
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
now,
all
capital
defendants
are
required
to
stand
trial
before
a
jury.
we
have
had
five
instances
in
seven
months
where
juries
have
refused
to
recommend
mercy.
and
along
the
same
line,
i
should
note
that
the
judicial
counsel
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
the
official
advisory
body
on
matters
of
legal
policy.
this
very
weekend,
back
in
yesterday’s
paper
recommended
that
the
provisions
added
in
1949
permitting
the
jury
to
recommend
mercy
be
repealed.
i
make
it
solely
an
issue
of
law.
excuse
me,
solely
on
issue
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
permit
the
law
solely
to
impose
the
punishment.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
death.
however,
if
it
please
the
court,
in
the
alford
case
we’re
really
not
concerned
with
this.
because
although
the
fourth
circuit
used
alford
as
a
form
to
completely
strike
down
capital
procedures
in
north
carolina.
alford,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder
which
completely
insulated,
they
are
not
only
from
the
death
penalty
but
also
from
the
imposition
of
life
imprisonment.
the
jackson
case
decided
in
light
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act
was
in
light
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
in
which
a
federal
criminal
defendant
could
waive
a
jury
trial
and
be
tried
by
a
judge.
in
north
carolina,
by
constitution,
a
criminal
defendant
cannot
waive
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
a
criminal
defendant
who
pleads
not
guilty
must
be
tried
by
a
jury.
a
bench
trial
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
one
aspect.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
one
aspect
of
the
case
your
honor.
but
the
opinion
states
quite
clearly
that
the
present
posture
of
the
north
carolina
statutes,
the
various
provisions
of
imposition
of
death
penalty
are
unconstitutional.
hence,
capital
punishment
may
not
under
jackson
be
imposed
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
would
appear
to
be
on
page
34
i
believe
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
state
repeal
has
considered
united
states
v.
jackson
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
concluded
that
jackson
is
not
applicable
to
our
procedures.
for
the
federal
system
in
the
various
statutes
under
consideration,
upon
conviction,
the
law
fixed
a
maximum
of
life
or
a
term
of
years.
however,
the
jury
could
in
this
various
situations
recommend
capital
punishment
thereby,
upgrading
the
punishment
permissible
by
law.
i
see
your
honor
that
my
time
is
very
quickly
coming
to
a
close
in
this.
i
would
like
to
quickly
point
out
chief
justice
haynesworth
dissent
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
this
is
actually
a
situation
of
plea
bargaining.
that
--
and
i
would
like
to
pull
out
to
this
court
that
in
holiday
versus
united
states.
this
tribunal
noted
that
80%
of
all
convictions
in
the
federal
system
are
upon
pleas
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere
and
various
researches
have
noted
that
90%
of
all
convictions
nationally
are
upon
pleas
of
guilty
of
nolo
contendere.
the
--
if
plea
bargaining
in
its
various
forms
is
to
be
struck
down
it
would
be
almost
a
mortal
blow
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states.
additionally,
we
come
to
the
very
issue,
of
whether
or
not
this
opinion
should
be
retroactive.
i
think
this
is
absolutely
vital.
in
north
carolina,
as
a
february
1st
of
this
year
there
were
448
defendants
serving
life
--
terms
of
life
imprisonment.
we
have
determined
that
68.8%
of
these
defendants
in
their
pleas
of
guilty
because
at
the
time
they
were
brought
to
trial
the
state
had
overwhelming
proof
of
their
guilt
and
they
pled
guilty.
now,
we
reach
the
weird
paradox
that
the
stronger
the
case
the
state
had
to
present
against
the
defendant,
the
stronger
his
argument
would
possibly
be
under
jackson.
the
weaker
the
state’s
case
then
of
course
the
weaker
would
be
the
defendant’s
argument
that
he
was
coerced
to
save
his
life.
the
various
federal
courts
which
i
have
considered
this
up
till
now
have
almost
uniformly
held
effect
would
be
devastating.
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
justice
brennan
is
well
aware,
the
non-bulk
procedure
has
been
in
effect
since
1893.
the
effect
to
new
jersey
would
be
absolutely
devastating
if
every
murder
who
pled
nun
vult
could
now
say
his
plea
was
involuntary.
in
fact,
the
north
carolina
counsel
has
submitted
an
opinion
from
new
york
state
this
week
in
which
new
york
state
statutes
were
held
in
light
of
jackson
and
alford
by
district
court
there.
if
that
done,
the
state
of
new
york
would
be
devastating.
the
federal
system
you
have
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
granted
your
honor
but
still,
i
submit
this
that
at
the
present
time
i’ve
already
been
involved
with
more
than
a
dozen
such
cases.
all
the
petitioner
does
is
say,
“we’ll
i
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty.”
or
unless
you
accept
the
fact
that
you
have
to
retrial
the
case
in
this
collateral
hearing
and
show
that
the
state’s
evidence
was
so
overwhelming
that
what
was
available
to
the
state
at
the
time
was
truly
the
basis
of
the
man’s
plea
of
guilty.
however,
i
submit
this
that
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
stronger
the
state’s
case
then
quite
frankly
if
the
defendant
says,
“you
know
if
i
had
to
be
tried.
if
the
case
was
that
heinous
it
may
very
well
have
emotional
overtones.”
that’s
the
very
reason
that
they
are
now
then
five
capital
convictions
in
the
last
seven
months.
the
heinous
crimes
that
previously
the
defendant
insulated
himself
through
the
device
of
a
guilty
plea,
these
defendants
are
now
having
to
stand
trial
and
have
their
cases
submitted
--
have
they
submit
to
juries.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
right
is
not
absolute
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
true.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
actually,
your
honor
i
don’t
believe
that
really
is
fair
to
assume
because
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
part
of
the
statute
but
i
believe
most
prosecutors
are
happier
to
accept
their
plea
and
have
the
case
end
there
and
then
rather
than
having
to
go
with
--
have
lengthy
trials
and
all
the
various
other
collateral
attacks
which
do
occur.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
your
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
no
circumstances
to
a
capital
offense.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
he
could
your
honor.
if
you
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
included
offense,
of
course
that’s
part
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
if
of
course
the
plea
were
freely
voluntarily
and
understandingly
entered
and
in
each
instance,
evidence
is
adduced
upon
the
tender
of
the
place
of
the
court
to
reveal.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
think
they
really
said
that.
what
they
said
was
this,
“you
have
a
situation
but
although
the
--”
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
case
such
as
this
one,
your
honor,
where
the
defendant
gets
up
after
tendering
its
plea,
and
then
starts
saying,
“i
have
not
shot
any
man.”
it
would
come
directly
within
in
the
alford
opinion.
however,
i
say
this,
that
if
a
defendant
tenders
a
plea
and
the
court
is
satisfied
it’s
freely,
voluntarily
and
knowingly
entered.
and
you
know,
and
the
defendant
is
admittedly
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
a
case
like
this,
it
would
your
honor.
but
if
the
defendant
were
admittedly
guilty,
it
would
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
you.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
upon
direct
appeal
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
opinion
of
that
court
from
the
divided
opinion.
chief
justice
haynesworth
dissenting
holding
that
statutory
scheme
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
in
north
carolina
in
light
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
united
states
v.
jackson
is
unconstitutional.
therefore,
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
the
import
and
impact
of
the
jackson
opinion
upon
the
laws
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
the
laws
of
our
sister
states
and
of
the
federal
judiciary.
on
the
evening
of
november
22,
1963,
nathaniel
young,
a
negro
gentleman
who
operated
a
house
that
could
best
be
described
as
a
party
house
in
the
city
of
winston-salem,
north
carolina
opened
--
responded
to
a
knock
at
the
door,
opened
the
door
slightly
and
was
cut
down
by
a
shotgun
blast.
earlier
that
evening,
petitioner
or
actually
the
appellee
in
this
case
henry
c.
alford,
had
come
to
that
house.
henry
alford
also
is
negro.
he
had
been
accompanied
by
a
white
girl.
they
purchased
several
drinks
of
liquor
by
the
drink
which
under
north
carolina
prohibition
board
--
prohibition
laws
is
not
legal.
and
then
henry
alford
gave
nathaniel
young
his
last
dollar
to
rent
a
room
in
that
house.
alford
was
accompanied
by
his
girlfriend
into
that
room
and
after
several
minutes,
they
left
because
henry
alford
no
longer
had
any
money.
he
demanded
that
this
young
lady
leave
with
him.
daniel
young,
the
proprietor
of
this
house
said,
“she
could
stay
here
if
she
wishes.”
an
argument
ensued
and
henry
alford
run
off
with
the
lady’s
coat
being
chased
by
nathaniel
young
and
someone
else.
approximately,
15
to
20
minutes
later,
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
nathaniel
young
was
cut
down
by
a
shotgun
blast.
alford
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
the
white
county
superior
court
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
counsel
was
appointed.
counsel
thoroughly
investigated
the
case.
counsel
contacted
every
witness
named
to
him
by
henry
alford
except
one
by
name
of
jack
who
cannot
be
found.
in
each
case,
the
testimony
of
alford’s
purported
witnesses
was
contrary
to
alford’s
allegations
as
to
their
testimony.
upon
the
call
of
the
case,
alford
through
counsel
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
which
under
north
carolina
law
carries
a
maximum
punishment
of
30
years
imprisonment.
he
did
not
plead
guilty
to
the
capital
offense
which
under
the
law
been
in
state
would
have
carried
a
life
sentence.
he
pled
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
the
state
then
placed
on
the
stand.
the
detective
e.
i.
weatherman
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
upon
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
upon
a
plan
of
guilty.
it
would
carry
a
penalty
of
life.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
alford
pled
guilty
to
murder
in
the
second
degree
which
carries
at
a
maximum,
a
sentence
of
30
years.
the
state
placed
on
the
stand
after
the
tender
of
the
plea,
officer
weatherman,
now
if
the
court
please,
i’m
not
sure
whether
or
not
you
--
this
court
has
a
copy
of
the
actual
trial
transcript
in
that
case.
i
have
a
copy
here
which
i’d
like
to
file
with
the
court
if
the
trial
transcript
is
not
included.
unfortunate
--
the
appendix
does
not
include
the
entire
trial
transcript.
it
does
not
include
the
testimony
of
the
officer
and
other
witnesses.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
that’s
true
your
honor.
however,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
court
of
the
evidence
and
also
to
give
the
court
an
opportunity
to
judge
the
nature
of
the
crime
for
the
purpose
of
sentencing,
evidence
was
presented.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
the
judges
presiding
at
the
trials
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened.
now,
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
plea,
counsel
obtained
this
affidavit.
the
defendant,
henry
c.
alford
after
being
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
not
sure
if
this
is
in
the
record
or
not,
your
honor.
i
like
to
submit
a
copy
of
this
also.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
i’d
like
to
show
what
happened
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
plea
your
honor
because
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
was
filed
as
part
of
the
post-conviction
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
of
white
county.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
this
has
gone
on
and
on,
your
honor,
i’ll
describe
the
rooting
in
my
argument.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
this
is
part
of
the
original
post-conviction
proceeding.
that
attorney
fred
g.
crumpler
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
defendant
has
conferred
with
the
defendant
on
numerous
occasions.
in
addition
to
this,
this
attorney
has
consulted
on
numerous
occasions
with
me
in
the
presence
of
my
sister
and
various
friends
in
preparation
for
the
trial
of
this
case.
this
attorney
has
advised
me
that
i’m
charged
with
a
capital
crime
and
if
i
plead
not
guilty,
the
possible
verdicts
of
the
jury
including
the
right
of
the
jury
to
find
me
not
guilty.
he
has
also
advised
me
that
if
i’m
convicted
with
first-degree
murder,
the
law
provides
for
mandatory
life
sentence
of
imprisonment
if
the
jury
recommends
mercy,
or
in
mandatory
death
penalty,
if
the
jury
does
not
recommend
mercy.
he
has
also
advised
me
of
my
rights
of
appeal
in
all
events
including
the
final
right
of
appeal
for
mercy
before
the
governor
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
i
hereby
authorized
attorney
fred
g.
crumpler
to
tender
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
offense
of
second-degree
murder
to
the
court
which
decision
is
in
my
own
freewill,
made
in
the
presence
of
my
sister
and
friends
who
are
also
present
during
the
consultation
with
said
attorney.
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
attorney
is
able,
experienced,
and
competent.
the
above
affidavit
has
been
both
read
by
me
and
to
me
by
the
undersigned
officer
of
the
court
and
it
was
read
to
the
defendant
and
signed
in
the
presence
of
r.b.
hoskins,
deputy
clerk
of
the
superior
court
of
white
county.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
counsel
as
this
court
is
well
aware
is
constantly
under
attacked
nowadays.
part
of
this,
i
submit
is
counsel’s
protection
of
himself
and
of
course,
this
is
also
a
written
authorization
to
counsel
to
enter
the
plea
on
his
client’s
behalf.
to
show
that
the
plea
was
authorized,
perhaps
an
expectation
of
the
boykin
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
in
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
this
was
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
--
part
of
the
counsel’s
private
records
but
then
was
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
that’s
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
assume
it’s
with
the
original
records
which
have
been
transmitted
to
this
court
as
the
record
has
been
built
up.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
footnoted
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’d
like
to
read
to
the
court
some
transcripts
--
some
excerpts
from
the
original
trial
transcript
to
show
the
court
the
taste
the
state
have
against
this
defendant.
we
then
contacted
ruby
mcgill
where
alford
had
been
living
and
ruby,
as
a
consequence
of
an
interview
with
her,
said
that
she
and
henry
have
been
living
together
for
some
three
years
that
they
were
at
this
address
about
five
months.
so
henry
left
around
dark
stating
that
he’ll
be
back
for
a
few
minutes.
that
about
two-and-a-half
to
three
hours
later,
he
came
back
and
stated
that
he
was
breathing
hard,
appearing
to
have
been
running
and
stated,
“g.d.s.o.b.
has
been
running
me,
i’m
going
to
kill
him.”
she
stated
that
at
that
time,
he
said
“nathaniel
young”
and
that
he
kept
and
he
repeated
that
a
couple
or
three
times
that
he
was
going
back
and
kill
the
s.o.b.
and
the
other
fellow
with
him
also.
she
stated
that
he
got
a
shotgun
out
of
the
wardrobe
and
four
shells.
that
she
and
shirley,
it’s
another
woman
who
was
there
at
the
time,
asked
him
not
to.
they
told
him
that
there
were
no
use
in
that
and
said
that
he
kept
repeating
that
he
was
going
back
and
went
out
the
door.
we
talked
to
betty
jeanne
robinson
who
stated
that
she
was
on
the
porch
of
the
store
at
1202,
10
1/2
street
which
is
little
better
about
half
a
block
from
the
home,
the
direction
of
nathaniel
young’s
home.
and
she
stated
that
she
and
paul
hill,
was
standing
on
the
porch
and
henry
c.
alford
came
by
them
with
a
gun.
in
her
statement
to
us,
ruby
mcgill
stated
that
after
he
left
with
a
gun
that
he
came
back
and
approximately
30
to
35
minutes
and
stated
that
--
said,
“honey,
if
i
don’t
kill
that
nathaniel,
i’m
going
to
leave
you
with
the
furniture.”
she
said,
“you
don’t
have
no
business
killing
any
man.”
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
killed
that
g.d.s.o.b.
i’m
not
going
to
have
anyone
to
kill
me.
i
went
to
the
door
and
when
i
shot
him,
he
just
turned
his
head
around
and
fell
on
the
floor.”
officers’
testimony
continues,
while
we
was
attempting
to
pickup
alford
in
regard
to
this,
we
went
to
the
home
of
sidney
lucky
who
leaves
down
a
couple
of
houses
across
the
street
and
we
first
went
to
his
house
around
11
o’clock
and
asked
him
if
henry
had
been
there.
he
said,
after
waking
him
said
that
he
had
come
in
there
and
told
him
if
the
officers
come
looking
for
me,
tell
them
i
haven’t
been
here.
and
i
talked
with
sidney
later
and
he
stated,
that
after
we
left,
he
went
out
and
found
alford
and
asked
him
why
we
was
looking
for
him
and
he
told
him
he
shot
a
man.
and
the
testimony
continues
here
with
another
witness
that
they
found,
a
young
lady
with
whom
alford
had
drinks
later
that
evening.
and
that
they
went
out
and
he
bought
her
two
drinks
of
whiskey
which
he
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
that
he
asked
her
for
her
address
and
her
full
name.
he
stated
that
he
had
shot
a
man
that
he’d
be
gone
a
long
time.
and
the
testimony
goes
on
and
on,
and
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
part
of
--
this
is
the
original
trial
transcript,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
on
the
plea
of
guilty.
prior
to
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
subsequent
to
its
tender
and
the
officer
concluded
his
testimony,
“and
the
gun
in
my
opinion
smelled
as
if
it
had
been
recently
fired.”
it
was
also
presented
that
this
original
hearing
upon
the
tender
of
the
guilty
plea,
the
testimony
of
shirley
wright,
who
was
the
young
lady’s
girlfriend
who
was
in
the
house
at
the
time.
and
she
states,
“after
he
came
in
and
got
the
gun,
i
left.”
well,
i’ll
describe
exactly
what
happened
when
he
came
to
get
the
gun.
well,
when
he
come
and
got
the
gun,
i
had
--
went
to
bathroom
and
i
come
out
and
he
had
got
the
gun.
you
know
and
he
said,
“i’m
going
to
kill
that
blank.”
so
he
didn’t
say
who
and
i
didn’t
ask
him.
i
just
told
him,
“no,
you
know,
don’t
do
it”
that’s
all
he
said
to
me.
so
this
was
what
was
tendered
to
the
court
by
the
detective
at
the
time
of
henry
c.
alford’s
tender
of
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
he
then
took
the
stand
himself.
and
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
the
night
that
he
--
he
have
not
shot
no
man.
but
there
from
the
circumstances
they
say,
“i’m
guilty.”
he
was
sentenced
to
30
years
in
prison.
approximately
three
months
later
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
but
remanded
the
case
to
the
superior
court
of
white
county
for
a
plenary
hearing
under
the
north
carolina
post-conviction
hearing
at.
in
due
course,
with
court-appointed
counsel,
the
hearing
was
held.
and
the
post-conviction
judge
found
that
the
tender
of
the
plea
was
really
involuntarily
made.
several
weeks
later,
alford
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
with
the
clerk
of
white
county
superior
court.
the
purpose
of
which,
i’m
really
not
sure
and
that
was
denied.
the
next
step
was
the
filing
of
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
clerk
of
united
states
district
court
from
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina.
the
court
dismissed
the
petition
at
that
time
because
alford
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
but
within
a
week
or
two
he
was
transferred
to
a
prison
unit
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
and
the
court
reinstated
the
application.
subsequently,
the
honorable
eugene
gordon,
united
states
district
court
judge
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
entered
an
opinion
denying
habeas
relief.
forty-eight
days
after
the
entry
of
judge
gordon’s
order
alford
filed
notice
of
appeal.
he
also
filed
an
additional
writ
of
habeas
corpus
directly
with
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
a
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
due
to
the
late
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
but
that
in
additional
application
for
habeas
corpus
had
been
filed
originally
in
that
court
and
chief
justice
haynesworth
of
the
fourth
circuit
entered
an
order
concluding
upon
the
original
application
of
that
court
that
alford’s
plea
of
guilty
was
really
voluntarily
and
understandingly
entered.
alford
subsequently
filed
yet
another
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
united
states
court
--
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
and
judge
gordon
once
again
reviewed
his
contentions
and
denied
relief.
from
that
denial,
alford
once
again
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
application
concluded
that
the
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
for
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
was
unconstitutional
in
light
of
the
united
states
v.
jackson,
the
jackson
decision
having
been
decided
in
the
interim
between
judge
gordon’s
denial
of
habeas
relief
and
the
filing
of
the
appeal.
until
1949,
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
upon
a
conviction
of
a
capital
crime,
the
four
capital
crimes
are
murder,
rape,
arson,
and
first-degree
burglary,
the
death
penalty
was
automatically
imposed.
in
1949,
the
legislature
amended
these
various
acts
to
permit
a
jury
to
recommend
mercy.
and
upon
that
recommendation,
the
defendant
would
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
in
1953,
yet
another
statute
was
passed
15-161
which
provided
that
upon
the
tender
of
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
crime,
in
writing
and
represented
by
counsel.
if
that
tender
is
accepted
by
the
solicitor
of
the
state
and
approved
by
the
court,
then
life
imprisonment
would
be
mandatorily
imposed.
in
view
of
that
scheme,
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
in
light
of
jackson
that
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme
was
invalid
and
held
that
alford
who
have
tendered
a
plea
to
second-degree
murder
was
coerced.
early
this
year,
the
legislator
of
north
carolina
repealed
n.c.g.s.
15-162.1,
the
provision
permitting
the
entry
of
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
offense.
it
is
of
interests
to
note
at
the
present
time
in
north
carolina,
there
are
11
defendants
under
sentence
of
death.
these
11
commenced
from
sentences
of
death
initially
imposed
in
february
of
1963
to
the
present.
from
february
of
1963
to
march
of
this
year,
prior
to
the
repeal
of
the
statute
there
are
six
defendants
under
sentence
of
death.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
it
happens
in
just
about
every
case
nowadays.
a
guilty
plea
as
you
are
well
aware
hardly
stops
of
the
appellate
procedures.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
had
not
in
capital
cases
yet.
but
in
the
typical
guilty
plea
situation
our
office
is
inundated
with
direct
appeals
from
guilty
pleas.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
--
as
i
say
in
this
capital
situation
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
not
familiar
with
their
ruling.
but
we
have
had
innumerable
situations.
each
week
we
are
flooded
with
appeals
which
are
noted
from
guilty
pleas.
so
i
would
assume
due
to
the
vast
volume
of
these
appeals
that
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
what
i
said
was
this.
since
february
of
1963
in
11
instances,
juries
have
refused
to
recommend
mercy.
of
these
11,
six
were
for
the
time
period
between
february
of
1963
through
march
of
this
year
subsequent
to
the
repeal
of
the
statute
permitting
a
capital
defendant
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
now,
all
capital
defendants
are
required
to
stand
trial
before
a
jury.
we
have
had
five
instances
in
seven
months
where
juries
have
refused
to
recommend
mercy.
and
along
the
same
line,
i
should
note
that
the
judicial
counsel
of
the
state
of
north
carolina,
the
official
advisory
body
on
matters
of
legal
policy.
this
very
weekend,
back
in
yesterday’s
paper
recommended
that
the
provisions
added
in
1949
permitting
the
jury
to
recommend
mercy
be
repealed.
i
make
it
solely
an
issue
of
law.
excuse
me,
solely
on
issue
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
permit
the
law
solely
to
impose
the
punishment.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
death.
however,
if
it
please
the
court,
in
the
alford
case
we’re
really
not
concerned
with
this.
because
although
the
fourth
circuit
used
alford
as
a
form
to
completely
strike
down
capital
procedures
in
north
carolina.
alford,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder
which
completely
insulated,
they
are
not
only
from
the
death
penalty
but
also
from
the
imposition
of
life
imprisonment.
the
jackson
case
decided
in
light
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act
was
in
light
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
in
which
a
federal
criminal
defendant
could
waive
a
jury
trial
and
be
tried
by
a
judge.
in
north
carolina,
by
constitution,
a
criminal
defendant
cannot
waive
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
a
criminal
defendant
who
pleads
not
guilty
must
be
tried
by
a
jury.
a
bench
trial
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
one
aspect.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
one
aspect
of
the
case
your
honor.
but
the
opinion
states
quite
clearly
that
the
present
posture
of
the
north
carolina
statutes,
the
various
provisions
of
imposition
of
death
penalty
are
unconstitutional.
hence,
capital
punishment
may
not
under
jackson
be
imposed
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
would
appear
to
be
on
page
34
i
believe
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
state
repeal
has
considered
united
states
v.
jackson
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
concluded
that
jackson
is
not
applicable
to
our
procedures.
for
the
federal
system
in
the
various
statutes
under
consideration,
upon
conviction,
the
law
fixed
a
maximum
of
life
or
a
term
of
years.
however,
the
jury
could
in
this
various
situations
recommend
capital
punishment
thereby,
upgrading
the
punishment
permissible
by
law.
i
see
your
honor
that
my
time
is
very
quickly
coming
to
a
close
in
this.
i
would
like
to
quickly
point
out
chief
justice
haynesworth
dissent
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
this
is
actually
a
situation
of
plea
bargaining.
that
--
and
i
would
like
to
pull
out
to
this
court
that
in
holiday
versus
united
states.
this
tribunal
noted
that
80%
of
all
convictions
in
the
federal
system
are
upon
pleas
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere
and
various
researches
have
noted
that
90%
of
all
convictions
nationally
are
upon
pleas
of
guilty
of
nolo
contendere.
the
--
if
plea
bargaining
in
its
various
forms
is
to
be
struck
down
it
would
be
almost
a
mortal
blow
to
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states.
additionally,
we
come
to
the
very
issue,
of
whether
or
not
this
opinion
should
be
retroactive.
i
think
this
is
absolutely
vital.
in
north
carolina,
as
a
february
1st
of
this
year
there
were
448
defendants
serving
life
--
terms
of
life
imprisonment.
we
have
determined
that
68.8%
of
these
defendants
in
their
pleas
of
guilty
because
at
the
time
they
were
brought
to
trial
the
state
had
overwhelming
proof
of
their
guilt
and
they
pled
guilty.
now,
we
reach
the
weird
paradox
that
the
stronger
the
case
the
state
had
to
present
against
the
defendant,
the
stronger
his
argument
would
possibly
be
under
jackson.
the
weaker
the
state’s
case
then
of
course
the
weaker
would
be
the
defendant’s
argument
that
he
was
coerced
to
save
his
life.
the
various
federal
courts
which
i
have
considered
this
up
till
now
have
almost
uniformly
held
effect
would
be
devastating.
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
justice
brennan
is
well
aware,
the
non-bulk
procedure
has
been
in
effect
since
1893.
the
effect
to
new
jersey
would
be
absolutely
devastating
if
every
murder
who
pled
nun
vult
could
now
say
his
plea
was
involuntary.
in
fact,
the
north
carolina
counsel
has
submitted
an
opinion
from
new
york
state
this
week
in
which
new
york
state
statutes
were
held
in
light
of
jackson
and
alford
by
district
court
there.
if
that
done,
the
state
of
new
york
would
be
devastating.
the
federal
system
you
have
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
granted
your
honor
but
still,
i
submit
this
that
at
the
present
time
i’ve
already
been
involved
with
more
than
a
dozen
such
cases.
all
the
petitioner
does
is
say,
“we’ll
i
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty.”
or
unless
you
accept
the
fact
that
you
have
to
retrial
the
case
in
this
collateral
hearing
and
show
that
the
state’s
evidence
was
so
overwhelming
that
what
was
available
to
the
state
at
the
time
was
truly
the
basis
of
the
man’s
plea
of
guilty.
however,
i
submit
this
that
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
stronger
the
state’s
case
then
quite
frankly
if
the
defendant
says,
“you
know
if
i
had
to
be
tried.
if
the
case
was
that
heinous
it
may
very
well
have
emotional
overtones.”
that’s
the
very
reason
that
they
are
now
then
five
capital
convictions
in
the
last
seven
months.
the
heinous
crimes
that
previously
the
defendant
insulated
himself
through
the
device
of
a
guilty
plea,
these
defendants
are
now
having
to
stand
trial
and
have
their
cases
submitted
--
have
they
submit
to
juries.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
right
is
not
absolute
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
true.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
actually,
your
honor
i
don’t
believe
that
really
is
fair
to
assume
because
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it’s
part
of
the
statute
but
i
believe
most
prosecutors
are
happier
to
accept
their
plea
and
have
the
case
end
there
and
then
rather
than
having
to
go
with
--
have
lengthy
trials
and
all
the
various
other
collateral
attacks
which
do
occur.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that’s
your
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
no
circumstances
to
a
capital
offense.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
he
could
your
honor.
if
you
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
included
offense,
of
course
that’s
part
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
if
of
course
the
plea
were
freely
voluntarily
and
understandingly
entered
and
in
each
instance,
evidence
is
adduced
upon
the
tender
of
the
place
of
the
court
to
reveal.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
think
they
really
said
that.
what
they
said
was
this,
“you
have
a
situation
but
although
the
--”
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
case
such
as
this
one,
your
honor,
where
the
defendant
gets
up
after
tendering
its
plea,
and
then
starts
saying,
“i
have
not
shot
any
man.”
it
would
come
directly
within
in
the
alford
opinion.
however,
i
say
this,
that
if
a
defendant
tenders
a
plea
and
the
court
is
satisfied
it’s
freely,
voluntarily
and
knowingly
entered.
and
you
know,
and
the
defendant
is
admittedly
guilty.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
a
case
like
this,
it
would
your
honor.
but
if
the
defendant
were
admittedly
guilty,
it
would
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
you.
