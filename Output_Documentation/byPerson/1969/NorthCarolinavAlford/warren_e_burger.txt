number

north
carolina
against
alford.
mr.
safron,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
is
this
in
the
record
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
we’re
getting
a
little
bit
outside
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
what
court
was
this
first
filed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
court
considered
that
document?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
was
it
considered
by
another
tribunal
after
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wanted
to
be
sure
we
weren’t
getting
new
material
or
new
matter
at
this
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
too
was
also
presented
for
the
first
time
of
the
post-conviction
hearing
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
my
original
trial
--
you
mean
on
the
plea
of
--
the
guilty
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
safron.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
bray,
before
you
get
started.
you
can
perhaps
clear
something
out
for
me.
i
have
not
found
in
your
brief
any
discussion
of
what
transpired
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea
in
sentencing
that
is
the
disclosure
of
the
case
against
alford
which
has
been
discussed
by
your
friend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
covered
that?
if
not,
will
you
--
at
some
point
in
your
argument
at
your
own
convenience
give
us
your
view
of
the
effect
to
that
testimony
as
it
relates
for
example
to
compliance
or
substantial
compliance
with
the
general
requirements
or
rule
of
evidence
in
the
federal
rules?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
bit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
some
difficulty
hearing
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
so
that
the
judge
will
not
accept
to
plea
guilty
unless
there
is
some
evidence
that
shows
him
in
a
very
substantial
way
that
the
state
has
a
case,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
not
very
important
in
this
whole
process?
is
it
not
indeed
the
key
to
the
whole
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
with
the
second-degree
murder
plea,
he
was
not
confronted
with
any
possibility
of
the
death
sentence.
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
in
this
equation,
do
you
say
that
we
must
--
with
the
court’s
dealing
with
it
must
weigh
the
statement
of
the
case
against
him,
against
his
current
statement
--
his
later
statement
that
he
was
not
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
the
court’s
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
stronger
the
state’s
case
against
him
by
way
of
evidence,
the
greater
the
coercion
as
you
characterize
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
cleared
up
the
points
that
were
troubling
me
so
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
bray
suppose
that
the
trial
in
this
case
had
started
and
the
government,
the
prosecution
put
on
its
entire
case
and
had
five
or
six
eyewitnesses
and
the
witnesses
to
whom
he
had
threatened
the
kind
and
advance
and
the
witnesses
to
whom
he
admitted
the
crime
after
the
event.
and
then
the
state
rest
and
then
he
decided
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
to
second
degree.
would
you
say
he
was
coerced
by
this
overwhelming
undisputed
evidence
against
him
or
is
he
coerced
by
this
same
problem
that
you
say
exists
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
justice
stewart
has
just
pointed
out
jackson
dealt
with
the
case
where
the
man
had
a
trial
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
now
i’m
giving
you
a
hypothetical
case
where
the
trial
has
started
with
undisputed
overwhelming
conclusive
testimony
against
him,
eyewitnesses
and
all.
now,
of
course
he’s
under
great
pressure,
isn’t
he?
no
one
would
dispute
that.
but
do
you
say
that
that’s
an
impermissible
kind
of
coercion
that
society
is
exercising
on
him
because
the
facts
destroy
his
possibility
of
getting
an
acquittal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
must
be
accepted
as
true
unless
its
refuted,
isn’t
that
the
whole
purpose
of
that
presentation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time
that
narration
is
given
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
bray.
i
think
your
time
is
up
counsel.
thank
you
for
your
submission
and
mrs.
bray
you
acted
at
the
appointment
of
the
court,
we
thank
you
for
accepting
the
appointment
and
responsibility.
the
case
is
submitted.
