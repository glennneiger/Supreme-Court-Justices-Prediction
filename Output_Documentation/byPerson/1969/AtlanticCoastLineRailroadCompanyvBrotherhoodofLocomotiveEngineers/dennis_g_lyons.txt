mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
previous
cases
involving
the
attempts
of
the
railway
brotherhoods
to
involve
the
neutral
carriers
in
their
seven-year
labor
dispute
with
the
fec.
the
basic
point
of
difference
is
that
this
is
the
first
case
which
involves
an
injunction
granted
out
of
the
courts
in
one
of
our
concurrent
jurisdictions,
the
federal
jurisdiction,
against
proceedings
in
state
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
for
the
brotherhood
here
to
prevail,
for
the
respondents
here
to
prevail,
they
must
on
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
prevail
on
two
points.
first,
they
must
show
that
this
case
falls
within
the
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
statute.
that
is
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code.
second,
after
bringing
the
case
within
those
exceptions,
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
on
the
merits
that
this
federal
court,
federal
law
defense
that
they
attempt
to
litigate
through
this
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings,
they
further
have
to
show
that
that
defense
is
a
good
and
valid
defense.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
and
they
further
have
to
show
that
that
is
sort
of
a
severable
point,
but
they
also
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
matter
started
by
the
injunction
that
our
side
sought
in
the
federal
court
being
denied
for
that
various
-–
very
reason.
we
on
the
other
hand
need
only
to
prevail
on
one
of
the
three
points,
which
we
have
just
mentioned.
we
need
only
to
demonstrate
either
that
this
case
is
not
within
any
of
the
exceptions
to
section
2283
or
that
the
preemption
or
supersession
defense
that
they're
attempting
to
litigate
in
this
fashion
isn't
a
good
one,
or
that
norris-laguardia
here
takes
away
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
enjoin.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
any
one
of
those
three
reasons
your
honor.
we
start
with
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code,
which
is
the
statute
that
takes
us
back
virtually
to
the
start
of
our
constitutional
republic.
in
its
earliest
version,
it
was
passed
in
1793.
it
has
been
amended
at
various
times,
but
remains
in
the
same
substantial
form
in
which
it
was
enacted
back
then
in
the
third
congress.
it
now
says,
“a
court
of
the
united
states
may
not
grant
an
injunction
to
stay
proceedings
in
a
state
court
except
as
expressly
authorized
by
act
of
congress
or
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
or
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.
”
this
court
has
construed
that
statute
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
century
and
three
quarters
that
it's
been
on
books.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute,
this
court
has
said,
is
to
avoid
needless
friction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
court
systems.
the
first
reason
obviously
is
comity
that
we
have
and
have
had
since
the
foundation
of
our
constitutional
republic,
two
independent
systems
of
courts
operating.
the
relationship
between
them
is
a
delicate
matter.
the
second
reason
is
that
of
uniformity.
as
this
court
has
once
said,
it
is
not
only
the
state
court
judges
that
are
capable
of
misinterpreting
this
court's
decisions.
the
lower
federal
courts,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
sometimes
are
in
error
themselves.
recognizing
that,
this
court
has
indicated
if
we
were
to
have
the
lower
federal
court
sitting
in
judgment
over
whether
the
federal
law
defenses
that
were
urged
in
the
state
courts
were
properly
passed
upon,
we
would
have
less
and
less
uniformity.
we
would
have
different
federal
judges
taking
different
views,
just
as
you
would
have
different
state
court
judges
taking
different
views
of
what
the
federal
law
was.
we
would
be
introducing
added
diversity
and
lack
of
uniformity
rather
than
simplifying
matters.
so
it
is
that
the
1793
legislation
is
in
a
way
in
the
same
-–
deals
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
court's
judiciary
act
of
1789,
which
again
has
been
on
the
books
and
has
been
the
basic
principle
of
this
court's
review
of
state
court
judgments.
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
validity
of
federal
law
defenses
that
are
set
up
in
the
state
courts.
but
then,
only
where
the
case
had
preceded
in
an
orderly
fashion
through
the
state
court
system
and
where
the
judgment
of
the
highest
state
court
that
is
available
to
pass
on
the
question
has
been
obtained.
back
in
1955,
under
the
present
version
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
section
2283
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
the
respondents
were
afforded
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
final
judgment
and
i
believe
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
they
indicated
that
they
would
so
that
they
could
take
an
appeal
from
it
through
the
state
court
system.
judge
lackey,
the
florida
trial
judge
afforded
them
that
right
in
his
letter
of
opinion,
the
letter
of
opinion
that's
complained
of
here
back
on
june
3,
1969
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
they
certainly
could.
it's
–-
they
have
not
done
that
and
the
respondents
have
not
admittedly
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
florida
law
i
believe
is
a
bit
unclear
as
to
that,
as
to
whether
it
would
be
or
not,
but
the
state
court
here
was
perfectly
plain
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
give
them
an
appealable
order.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
were
asked
to
come
into
agreement
with
counsel
for
the
respondent
as
to
the
form
of
the
judgment
to
be
entered
and
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
i'm
sure
will
confirm
this
as
indicated
that
he
does
not
wish
to
join
with
us
in
settling
the
terms
of
a
final
judgment
or
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
believe
we
have
sent
him
a
draft.
we
have
never
taken
the
other
step,
but
he
has
never
given
us
any
comments
on
the
form
of
the
judgment.
i
mean
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor,
the
only
point
we're
trying
to
make
is
that
it's
entirely
within
the
respondent's
power
if
he
wants
to
appeal
judge
lackey's
injunction.
it's
within
-–
entirely
within
his
power
to
do
so,
and
judge
lackey
has
afforded
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
it
could
be.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
respondent
so
requested.
there
was
a
–-
an
extensive
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
in
the
–-
as
many
facts
were
developed
then,
i
believe
this
could
be
developed.
in
1955,
using
as
it
was
then
in
effect,
the
present
version
of
section
2283,
in
the
richman
brothers
case
this
court
made
it
plain
that
litigation
of
the
so-called
labor
preemption
or
labor
supersession,
federal
law
defense
to
a
state
court
proceeding
was
not
an
exception
to
section
2283
simply
because
your
position
was
that
the
state
court
was
moving
in
an
area
where
there
was
preemption
or
supersession
because
of
federal
labor
policy.
that
did
not
give
you
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings.
the
court
there
said
that
there
was
no
additional
implicit
exception
to
be
read
into
section
2283
even
where
the
contention
by
the
party
seeking
the
injunction
was
that
the
state
court
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
having
invaded
a
field
preempted
by
congress
and
let
me
say
that
this
case
i
believe
is
not
even
as
strong
a
case
for
a
federal
court
injunction
as
was
richman
brothers.
in
richman
brothers,
we
had
a
situation
under
the
taft-hartly
act,
the
labor
management
relations
act
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
courts
are
without
jurisdiction.
now,
the
principal
substantive
authority
for
their
preemption
or
supersession
defense
that
the
respondents
are
urging
here
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
the
last
term
where
this
court
expressly
said
that
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
or
that
in
the
circumstances
there
presented
that
the
application
of
their
own
state
substantive
law
had
there
to
yield
because
of
preeminent
federal
policies.
now,
since
there's
no
implicit
exception
for
adjudication
of
the
preemption
or
supersession
defense,
we
turn
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
there
are
two
exceptions
in
the
statute
that
the
respondents
are
citing.
the
first
exception
is
for
injunctions
necessary
in
aid
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
the
revisers
note
in
the
existing
precedence
from
the
pre-1948
era,
and
this
exception
at
least
was
designed
to
carry
forward
the
pre-existing
law,
indicate
that
that
exception
deals
with
two
cases.
first,
you
have
the
removed
case
where
case
is
removed
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court,
and
then
the
state
court
tries
to
go
ahead
with
the
case
as
if
nothing
had
happened.
and
there,
the
authorities
indicate
that
in
order
to
protect
its
jurisdiction,
in
aid
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
it
may
enjoin
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
other
has
to
do
with
fund
or
breaking
the
line,
what
the
courts
call
a
reese,
if
there's
a
particular
fund
than
only
one
court
could
take
jurisdiction
over,
the
exception
is
also
applicable.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
klein
versus
burke
construction
and
princess
lida
v.
thompson
back
before
the
codification
which
this
codification,
we
submit,
carried
forward,
indicate
that
you
may,
despite
that
language,
have
parallel
proceedings
which
seek
general
or
personal
relief
in
the
two
systems
at
the
same
time.
so
here,
there
could
be
a
federal
court
suit
under
federal
law
and
the
state
court
suit
under
state
law.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
proceeding
in
one
doesn't
affront
the
jurisdiction
of
the
other.
the
next
exception
that
they
cite
in
which
i
think
is
the
basis
of
the
primary
reliance
by
the
respondents
is
the
exception
for
injunctions
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
district
court's
judgments.
now,
the
revisers
note
teaches
that
that
was
aimed
to
prevent
re-litigation
by
the
state
courts
of
a
dispute
which
had
been
finally
litigated
by
a
federal
court.
in
effect,
it
was
designed
to
overrule
perhaps
the
high
water
decision
of
this
court's
construction
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
which
was
the
2cv
new
york
life
case
back
in
1941.
the
respondents
have
tried
then
to
characterize
this
case
as
one
where
the
federal
court
was
acting
in
enjoining
these
proceedings
simply
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
they
pointed
to
a
whole
litany
of
proceedings
in
the
federal
court
the
cases
involving
the
government's
suit
against
the
fec
to
which
the
carrier
–-
the
other
carriers
aren't
a
party
and
the
so-called
clark's
case,
which
came
before
this
court
in
1966,
which
was
a
proceeding
which
was
designed
to
see
how
far
the
fec
could
go
in
changing
the
work
rules
with
their
own
employees
during
the
strike.
there
is
no
order
whatsoever
or
judgment
whatsoever
in
any
of
these
other
proceedings
that
we
are
strangers
to,
which
the
respondent
cite
as
being
the
order
the
district
court
was
attempting
to
protect
or
effectuate
here.
we
come
back
to
the
order
which
is
the
one
that
they've
relied
on
throughout,
and
that
is
the
april
26,
1967
order
of
the
federal
district
court,
which
was
the
order
which
denied
the
injunction
to
the
acl
under
federal
law.
now,
that
order
says
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
remedies
in
the
state
court
under
state
law.
indeed,
if
getting
the
injunction
in
the
state
court
affronted
that
order
of
the
federal
court,
it
took
the
respondents
quite
a
long
time
to
complain
of
that
to
the
federal
court.
the
state
court
order
-–
the
federal
court
order
was
entered
in
april,
1967,
the
state
court
order
in
may,
1967.
then
two
years
passed
and
it
was
not
until
1969
that
the
respondents
suggested
that
there
was
something
in
the
1967
order
of
the
federal
court
that
the
state
court
injunction
contravened.
i
think
the
explanation
for
this
delay
is
simple.
what
happened
in
1969
was
this
court's
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
litigation.
what
we
are
trying
-–
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
litigate
in
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
really
with
the
meaning
of
the
district
court's
1967
order.
what
they
are
trying
to
litigate
is
a
preemption
defense
based
upon
the
intervening
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case,
and
that
we
submit
puts
us
into
the
richman
brothers
situation
where
this
court
has
held
that
there
will
be
no
implicit
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
statute
to
permit
–-
to
permit
litigants
to
try
out
the
validity
of
preemption
or
supersession
defenses
against
state
law
proceedings.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
keep
using
those
two
terms,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
it's
either.
it's
the
existence
of
a
federal
law
type
of
defense,
a
federal
privilege
or
a
federal
immunity,
if
you
will,
that
is
urged
as
a
bar
to
the
state
proceeding.
i
think
this
is
a
–-
in
a
fortiori
case
really
from
richman
brothers
if
you
couldn't
try
out
through
an
injunction
proceeding,
our
contention
that
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever,
it
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
from
that
that
you
couldn't
try
out
by
way
of
an
injunction
against
them
whether
there
was
some
sort
of
federal
law
defense.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right
or
wrong.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
was
their
claim,
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
that's
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
that's
-–
that's
simply
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct.
there
are
a
number
of
other
reasons
why
the
injunction
here
is
not
properly
within
the
exception
for
injunctions
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
federal
court's
orders.
in
the
first
place,
the
real
basis
to
us
of
the
federal
court's
denial
of
an
injunction
back
in
1967
to
the
acl
appears
to
be
the
norris-laguardia
act.
virtually,
all
the
cases
which
the
order
cites
are
norris-laguardia
act
cases
and
the
standard
as
well
as
legislative
history
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
makes
it
quite
plain
that
that
act
was
aimed
solely
at
the
federal
courts
and
does
not
take
away
the
remedies
and
rights
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
we
were
to
the
point
where
we
were
discussing
the
--
what
we
take
to
be
the
principle
contention
of
the
respondents
here
and
that
is
that
the
april
26,
1967
order
of
the
federal
district
court
and
that
was
the
order
that
denied
the
atlantic
coast
line
a
preliminary
injunction
that
that
order
was
being
protected
or
effectuated
by
the
subsequent
injunction,
the
1969
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
may
1967
order
of
the
state
court
and
that
on
that
basis,
they
contend
there
is
an
exception
here
from
section
2283.
our
basic
answer
to
that
preposition
is
that
the
federal
district
court
never
purported
to
pass
upon
the
availability
of
state
rights
or
state
remedies
to
the
atlantic
coast
line.
his
decree
amounted
to
a
denial
of
the
injunction,
which
was
sought
solely
under
federal
law.
their
argument
which
was
made
for
the
first
time
two
years
later
that
the
state
injunction
of
may
1967
contravened
the
federal
denial
of
an
injunction
is
we
submit
simply
a
setting
up
of
the
federal
law
defense
based
on
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
jacksonville
terminal
against
the
injunction
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
now,
there
are
number
of
subsidiary
reasons
why
that
april
26,
1967
order
could
not
be
the
basis
of
the
claimed
exception
here
from
section
2283.
in
the
first
place
as
we
read
the
order,
there
is
some
dispute
about
it,
but
most
of
the
cases
that
it
cites
are
norris-laguardia
act
cases
and
that
it
appears
to
us
to
proceed
primarily
on
the
basis
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
we
contend
that
the
federal
court
order
simply
declined
an
injunction
by
reason
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
of
course,
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
is
clear
that
it
leaves
open
the
remedies
under
state
law
and
in
the
state
courts.
the
respondents
contend
that
the
federal
court
order
somehow
constituted
a
comprehensive
declaration
of
the
party’s
rights.
and
in
effect,
i
suppose
held
that
coastline,
the
neutral
road
had
no
right
to
injunctive
relief
here
on
any
basis.
on
its
face,
the
order
simply
doesn’t
say
that.
the
most
you
could
say,
if
the
order
were
a
declaration
of
rights
and
we
read
it
that
way
if
at
all
we'd
be
to
this
simply
a
denial
on
the
basis
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
all
it
denied
were
rights
under
federal
law.
there
is
the
further
point
that
it
is
simply
an
order
made
upon
application
for
at
the
most
preliminary
injunction,
indeed
it
might
have
been
an
order
simply
denying
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
record
is
a
little
unclear,
but
giving
the
respondents
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
it's
an
order
the
denying
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
laws,
we
submit
quite
black
letter
on
the
point
that
you
cannot
have
a
determination
of
the
party's
substantive
rights
through
a
preceding
on
a
preliminary
injunction
application.
we
submit
then
that
really
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
adjudicate
this
federal
law
defense,
call
it
preemption
or
super
session
or
maybe
perhaps
simply
called
the
insertion
of
a
federal
law
defense
to
the
state
court
injunction
by
enjoining
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
and
this
we
submit
is
at
the
core
of
what
section
2283
says
that
federal
courts
are
not
to
do.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
he
said
that
since
the
respondents
had
filed
the
hand
written
answer
which
they
did
very
shortly
before
the
notice
of
dismissal
that
it
was
dismissible
as
of
right
and
he
then
declined
to
grant
the
injunct
--
the
order
for
a
voluntary
dismissal
upon
motion.
and
he
said
that
since
the
court
was
of
opinion
that
the
defendants
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
that
is
their
counter
motion
seeking
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceedings
has
merit,
our
motion
for
voluntary
dismissal
will
be
denied.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
on
page
195
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
in
effect,
he
is
assigned
the
reason
that
he
wants
to
pass
an
injunction
against
the
plaintiff
as
a
reason
for
denying
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
back
in
1967,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
it
was
not.
the
case
simply
laid
dormant
for
two
years.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
case
that
we
now
have
before
this
court.
if
the
contentions
that
we
make
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
2283
are
not
well
founded,
the
court
must
still
reach
the
question
whether
the
defense
that
the
respondents
have
urged
to
the
state
court
injunction
is
a
good
defense.
now
of
course,
if
the
court
is
in
agreement
with
us,
that
section
2283
is
applicable
here
and
that
none
of
the
exception
is
applicable,
then
the
court
need
not
reach
this
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
it
certainly
is,
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct.
if
i
might
amplify
a
little
bit
on
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice
yesterday,
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
we
did
not
proceed
to
have
an
final
judgment
entered
ourselves
right
away,
was
that
judge
mccray's
order
out
of
the
federal
district
court
enjoined
us
from
proceeding
further
with
the
state
court
proceedings.
that
injunction
followed
on
the
heels
fairly
closely
of
the
statement
by
the
state
judge
that
he
would
be
willing
to
enter
a
final
order
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
he
restrained
us
your
honor
from
taking
any
further
action
in
furtherance
of
the
rights
that
we
have
in
the
state
court
and
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
just
us.
but
the
state
court
judge
indicated
to
one
of
the
parties
to
prepare
a
decree
and
that
went
under
the
federal
court
injunction,
we
were
there
shortly
thereafter.
but
our
position
is
plain,
the
respondents
are
entitled
to
a
final
judgment
that
they
could
feel
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
that's
--
i
think
is
completely
clear
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
we
concede
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
a
final
judgment
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
they
are,
although,
i
can't
speak
for
them.
we
submit
that
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
which
is
the
respondent's
principle,
perhaps,
sole
authority
for
the
preposition
that
they
have
a
federal
law
defense
is
not
applicable
to
the
situation
involved
here
at
the
moncrief
yard,
which
is
a
yard,
wholly
owned
by
the
atlantic
coastline,
a
non-struck
carrier.
now,
we
do
not
intend
to
take
the
liberty
of
parsing
for
the
court's
opinion
rendered
only
one
year
ago,
but
we
do
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
very,
very
extensive
discussion
of
the
very
peculiar
facts
involved
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
in
that
opinion.
the
fact
that,
there
we
had
a
joint
terminal
facility
which
was
jointly
owned
and
jointly
controlled
by
the
carriers
including
the
struck
carrier
and
the
struck
carrier
had
a
right
to
veto
over
the
major
decisions
that
might
be
undertaken
with
respect
to
those
premises.
those
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
you
do
not
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
point
of
argument
at
this
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
should
have
belabored
the
point
but
the
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal
as
we
read
it
at
least,
it
seems
to
us
to
turn
on
these
unique
factors
at
this
jointly
owned
facility.
this
is
a
facility
where
fec
employees
report
for
work
everyday
on
foot
which
was
jointly
controlled
by
them,
which
was
in
effect
the
fec
passenger
terminal
at
the
northern
end,
which
sold
tickets
for
the
fec,
which
were
repaired
fec
cars,
which
performed
extensive
switching
and
rowing
services
for
them.
the
court
discussed
at
some
length
the
analogy
with
the
common
situs
cases
under
the
taft-hartley
act
and
in
effect
as
we
read
the
opinion,
the
court
concluded
that
in
that
context,
the
rather
tangled
involved
context
of
a
joint
facility
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
it
could
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
extent
the
parties
self
help
rights
were
properly
exercisable
and
to
what
extent
they
were
not.
the
court
took
the
view
that
we
submit
in
that
area
at
least
that
that
essentially
had
to
be
a
legislative
judgment.
now
here,
we
have
gone
beyond
the
exercise
of
self
help
rights
against
the
primary
parties
to
the
dispute.
we
have
gone
beyond
the
situation
where
the
primary
party,
the
fec
is
involved
in
the
joint
use
and
control
of
a
terminal
facility.
what
we
have
here
is
essentially
hot
car
picketing.
at
first,
it
did
not
start
out
that
way
and
there
are
still
in
this
court
protestations
that
that
is
not
what
was
going
on.
but
particularly
in
the
last
few
days
of
the
picketing
here,
what
you
had
was
an
attempt
and
a
successful
attempt
to
induce
the
employees
of
the
coastline,
operating
within
the
coastline's
own
yard,
not
to
handle
cars
which
had
originated
on
the
fec,
and
not
to
handle
inbound
cars
coming
down
from
the
north
that
were
ultimately
destined
to
the
fec.
now,
there
is
some
talk
by
the
respondents
that
this
was
done
in
a
limited
way
that
they
only
refused
to
handle
long
solid
blocks
of
cars,
that
they
only
refused
to
make
the
very
next
move
down
to
the
point
where
the
interchange
would
take
place.
but
the
record
is
plain
particularly
in
the
last
few
days
of
the
picketing
that
the
refusals
by
the
employees
went
well
beyond
that.
that
they
were
beyond
simply
involving
this
last
move
down
back
from
the
interchange
point.
that
in
one
case
they
declined
to
move
a
road
train
that
was
destined
up
to
go
through
way
cross
georgia,
which
is
fully
made
up
simply
because
it
had
fec
cars
in
it.
and
in
the
court
below
in
the
--
before
the
state
court
i
should
say,
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
took
the
view
that
this
court's
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal
was
to
the
effect
that
it
was
no
longer
any
question
of
how
far
you
can
go
or
how
far
you
can't
go,
that
there
was
no
longer
any
body
of
law
available
to
any
employer
doing
business
with
the
fec,
that
would
in
any
way
restrict
their
right
to
picket
his
business.
now,
we
contend
that
if
you
read
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
that
way,
what
you
have
is
picketing
which
i
think
anybody
would
consider
secondary
picketing.
that's
not
a
magic
word,
but
it
is
a
word
that
expresses
sort
of
judgment
about
what
it
is
when
people
who
are
essentially
strangers
to
a
labor
dispute
have
their
businesses
interfered
with
by
the
parties
to
a
labor
dispute.
and
it
is
a
practice
which
the
congress
has
outlawed
and
outlawed
in
increasingly
stringent
terms
for
the
last
23
years,
starting
at
1947.
and
which,
the
legislatures
in
virtually
all
the
states
and
the
state
courts
of
common
law
have
outlawed.
what
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
as
i
understand
is
that
despite
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
taft-hartley
act
is
not
as
we
concede
not
applicable
here
in
the
railroad
industry
that
there
is
no
agency
of
government
state
or
federal,
judicial
or
administrative
that
can
any
way
regulate
or
any
way
deal
with
these
practices
regardless
of
how
far
removed
they
are
from
directly
operating
upon
the
party
that
they
have
the
dispute
with.
in
other
words,
the
hot
car
approach,
or
the
hot
cargo
approach,
or
the
so-called
hot
property
approach
is
outlawed
in
firstly
every
industry
by
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
landrum-griffin
act,
but
not
in
the
railroad
area
and
what
is
more
to
say
the
respondents
that
the
states
cannot
do
anything
about
it
either.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
a
--
i
assume
you
have
those
before
him
because
that
transcript
was
available
to
him
from
the
hearing
two
years
before
and
he
did
refer
two
certain
findings
that
the
use
of
the
moncrief
yard
was
an
integral
and
necessary
part
of
the
fec's
operations,
which
is
clear
if
they
cannot
receive
cars
coming
down
from
the
north
or
if
they
can't,
if
there
is
a
blockage
of
the
way
in
which
their
cars
go
up
to
the
north,
they
simply
can't
operate.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor,
but
of
course
here,
we
do
have
an
independent
owner,
we
have
the
acl
which
is
completely
independent
to
the
fec.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
or
indeed
these
have
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
or
indeed
i
would
think
it
you've
the
same
result
had
they
gone
up
to
way
cross
georgia
or
whatever
the
next
junction
point,
or
the
next
point
where
they
conveniently
could
have
blockaded
the
trains,
getting
through
these
other
points
going
up
to
the
north
are
similarly
integral
and
essential
to
the
fec's
business.
unless
it
can
have
some
way
of
getting
its
cars
through
the
points
that
it
is
suppose
to
get
them
to,
beyond
its
own
line,
it
is
not
going
to
continue
operate.
your
honors,
we
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
wouldn't
have
gone
to
state
courts,
but
we
would
have
made
a
similar
argument
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
certainly
would.
i'd
make
the
section
2283
argument.
i
do
not
really
see
how
i
could
make
an
argument
on
the
merits
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
in
support
of
the
state
court's
action
because
that
--
that's
a
very
clear
area.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
to
the
section
2283,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we
submit
lastly
that
if
the
jacksonville
terminal
decision
means
what
the
respondents
say
that
it
means,
it
should
be
reconsidered
by
this
court,
though,
clearly
we
think
the
court
need
not
reach
that
point
at
all.
our
final
contention
takes
us
into
an
area
which
is
relatively
unchartered
by
this
court's
decisions
and
that
is
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
here
as
well
as
section
2283
precludes
the
injunction
that
the
federal
court
granted.
the
relationship
between
the
non-struck
carriers
and
the
rail
unions
has
been
held
by
the
lower
courts
and
this
court
in
a
four
to
four
decision
once
upheld
that
as
being
a
relationship
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
and
hence,
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
by
this
court
and
then
this
case,
the
moncrief
case
by
the
lower
court,
the
non
struck
carriers
have
been
held
not
to
be
entitled
to
have
a
federal
court
injunction.
we
say
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
works
both
ways.
if
the
federal
courts
may
not
pass
an
injunction
against
the
unions,
we
submit
that
in
this
situation,
they
may
not
pass
an
injunction
against
the
non
struck
carriers
restraining
them
from
the
use
of
the
state
courts.
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
it
does
work
both
ways,
that
it
does
inhibit
injunctions
against
management
just
as
it
inhibits
injunctions
against
unions.
and
in
fact,
we
quote
in
our
brief
considerable
dialog
in
the
floor
of
senate
and
the
house
which
indicate
the
congress
recognized
that
this
was
a
two-edged
sword
when
it
was
passed
back
in
1932.
indeed,
some
of
the
practices
that
can't
be
enjoined
are
practices
that
only
an
employer
could
commit
i.e
joining
an
employer
organization.
so,
we
submit
that
the
very
broad
contention
that
the
respondents
make
that
the
act
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
injunctions
against
management
is
not
correct.
we
also
say
that
section
4
(d)
of
the
statute
makes
it
plain
that
injunctions
against
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
were
one
of
the
evils
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
when
it
passed
the
statute.
that
being
so,
we
are
confronted
with
the
very
flat
prohibition
in
section
7,
which
flatly
restrains
the
courts
of
the
united
states
from
granting
any
injunction
or
labor
dispute
unless
certain
findings
were
made
and
those
findings
were
not
made
here,
including
findings
which
certainly
were
very
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
here.
namely,
there
was
no
finding
that
the
complainant
has
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
certainly
his
appellate
rights
in
florida
state
courts
would
have
precluded
the
making
of
that
finding.
indeed,
there
was
no
attempt
to
comply
of
norris-laguardia
act
at
all.
so
for
this
reason
as
well,
we
contend
that
the
injunction
here
should
not
have
been
granted
against
the
state
court
proceedings
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
your
honors
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
there
is
not.
the
--
we
do
have
a
stay
of
the
federal
court
order
which
is
in
fact
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
milledge
referred
to
a
number
of
other
proceedings
besides
the
case
at
bar
which
presumably
the
district
court
was
protecting
orders
in
--
by
enjoining
the
state
court
proceedings
here.
now,
the
district
court
itself
never
cited
any
of
these
other
cases.
i
don't
believe
they
were
cited
to
it
by
counsel.
they
were
mentioned
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
there
are
three
proceedings
essentially,
one
of
them
is
the
so
called
the
clerks
case
to
which
the
neutral
carriers
are
not
even
a
party.
the
other
is
a
proceeding
in
which
there's
never
been
any
order
entered
of
any
affirmative
or
even
negative
sort
it
and
the
only
other
one
is
this
1963
case
and
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
entered
in
that
and
we
discuss
all
of
these
in
our
brief.
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
entered
in
that
is
an
order
that
the
fec
got
against
the
atlantic
coastline
and
the
other
neutral
carriers
requiring
them
to
interchange
and
we
scarcely
see
how
the
state
court
order
in
any
way
contravenes
that
order
since
the
picketing
that
the
state
court
sought
to
enjoin
was
designed
to
disrupt
the
interchange
by
getting
the
coastline
stop
the
interchange.
this
case
is
quite
different
than
from
the
looney
case
which
was
mentioned
frequently
by
counsel
in
his
oral
argument.
in
looney,
there
was
an
affirmative
interlocutory
injunction
granted
by
the
federal
court.
then
a
state
court
ordered
the
taking
of
certain
action
which
was
inconsistent,
completely
inconsistent
with
the
federal
court
injunction
and
it
was
held
that
the
federal
court
could
enjoin
proceedings
upon
that
state
court
injunction
notwithstanding
that
the
federal
court
injunction
was
interlocutory.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
there
is
no
order
whatsoever
that
the
injunction
under
review
protects
or
effectuates
the
assertions
of
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
have
been
solely
assertions
as
to
the
federal
law
rights.
there
is
no
diversity,
the
state
law
claims
were
never
pleaded.
we
get
down
to
the
final
point
in
this
case
that
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
adjudicate
this
defense
based
on
their
reading
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
by
way
of
brining
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings.
now,
they
have
stated
that
the
argument
we're
making
is
essentially
a
pigeon
whole
argument
that
they
have
to
point
to
a
specific
exception
to
the
statute.
well
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads,
pigeon
whole
is
a
kind
of
a
tendentious
way
of
saying
it
but
it's
a
general
statute
with
specific
exceptions.
as
the
court
said
in
richman
brothers,
legislative
policy
is
here
expressed
in
section
2283,
in
a
clear
cut
prohibition
qualified
only
by
specifically
defined
exceptions.
the
exception
i
think
that
the
respondents
are
trying
to
urge
on
this
court
is
the
exception
that
we
heard
much
of
the
very
end
of
mr.
milledge's
argument
and
that
is
that
they
just
can't
wait
for
the
orderly
adjudication
of
their
federal
defenses
in
the
state
courts.
they
have
not
joined
with
us
in
entering
a
final
judgment.
they
admit
that
they
could
have
had
one
entered.
they
have
left
that
situation
stand
now
for
nine
months.
they
have
not
lifted
a
finger
to
take
an
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
the
preposition
we
submit
that
the
respondents
are
urging
upon
this
court
cuts
at
the
very
heart
of
what
congress
tried
to
do
back
in
1793
and
ever
since
when
it
is
enacted
and
reenacted
this
statute.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
he
had
purported
to
--
had
purported
to
exercise
the
power
adjudicate
state
law
claims
or
deny
their
existence,
then
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
and
it's
exclusive,
then
we
would
have
quite
a
different
case.
you
could
make
the
argument
that
what
we
were
trying
to
do
then
was
to
re-litigate
that
order
and
that
we
should
have
appealed
that
order.
now,
we
didn't
appeal
his
order
and
if
it
said
something
else
from
what
it
had
said,
presumably
our
decision
as
to
appeal
would
have
been
quite
different.
thank
you
,your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
previous
cases
involving
the
attempts
of
the
railway
brotherhoods
to
involve
the
neutral
carriers
in
their
seven-year
labor
dispute
with
the
fec.
the
basic
point
of
difference
is
that
this
is
the
first
case
which
involves
an
injunction
granted
out
of
the
courts
in
one
of
our
concurrent
jurisdictions,
the
federal
jurisdiction,
against
proceedings
in
state
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
for
the
brotherhood
here
to
prevail,
for
the
respondents
here
to
prevail,
they
must
on
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
prevail
on
two
points.
first,
they
must
show
that
this
case
falls
within
the
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
statute.
that
is
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code.
second,
after
bringing
the
case
within
those
exceptions,
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
on
the
merits
that
this
federal
court,
federal
law
defense
that
they
attempt
to
litigate
through
this
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings,
they
further
have
to
show
that
that
defense
is
a
good
and
valid
defense.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
and
they
further
have
to
show
that
that
is
sort
of
a
severable
point,
but
they
also
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
matter
started
by
the
injunction
that
our
side
sought
in
the
federal
court
being
denied
for
that
various
-–
very
reason.
we
on
the
other
hand
need
only
to
prevail
on
one
of
the
three
points,
which
we
have
just
mentioned.
we
need
only
to
demonstrate
either
that
this
case
is
not
within
any
of
the
exceptions
to
section
2283
or
that
the
preemption
or
supersession
defense
that
they're
attempting
to
litigate
in
this
fashion
isn't
a
good
one,
or
that
norris-laguardia
here
takes
away
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
enjoin.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
any
one
of
those
three
reasons
your
honor.
we
start
with
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code,
which
is
the
statute
that
takes
us
back
virtually
to
the
start
of
our
constitutional
republic.
in
its
earliest
version,
it
was
passed
in
1793.
it
has
been
amended
at
various
times,
but
remains
in
the
same
substantial
form
in
which
it
was
enacted
back
then
in
the
third
congress.
it
now
says,
“a
court
of
the
united
states
may
not
grant
an
injunction
to
stay
proceedings
in
a
state
court
except
as
expressly
authorized
by
act
of
congress
or
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
or
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.
”
this
court
has
construed
that
statute
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
century
and
three
quarters
that
it's
been
on
books.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute,
this
court
has
said,
is
to
avoid
needless
friction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
court
systems.
the
first
reason
obviously
is
comity
that
we
have
and
have
had
since
the
foundation
of
our
constitutional
republic,
two
independent
systems
of
courts
operating.
the
relationship
between
them
is
a
delicate
matter.
the
second
reason
is
that
of
uniformity.
as
this
court
has
once
said,
it
is
not
only
the
state
court
judges
that
are
capable
of
misinterpreting
this
court's
decisions.
the
lower
federal
courts,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
sometimes
are
in
error
themselves.
recognizing
that,
this
court
has
indicated
if
we
were
to
have
the
lower
federal
court
sitting
in
judgment
over
whether
the
federal
law
defenses
that
were
urged
in
the
state
courts
were
properly
passed
upon,
we
would
have
less
and
less
uniformity.
we
would
have
different
federal
judges
taking
different
views,
just
as
you
would
have
different
state
court
judges
taking
different
views
of
what
the
federal
law
was.
we
would
be
introducing
added
diversity
and
lack
of
uniformity
rather
than
simplifying
matters.
so
it
is
that
the
1793
legislation
is
in
a
way
in
the
same
-–
deals
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
court's
judiciary
act
of
1789,
which
again
has
been
on
the
books
and
has
been
the
basic
principle
of
this
court's
review
of
state
court
judgments.
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
validity
of
federal
law
defenses
that
are
set
up
in
the
state
courts.
but
then,
only
where
the
case
had
preceded
in
an
orderly
fashion
through
the
state
court
system
and
where
the
judgment
of
the
highest
state
court
that
is
available
to
pass
on
the
question
has
been
obtained.
back
in
1955,
under
the
present
version
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
section
2283
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
the
respondents
were
afforded
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
final
judgment
and
i
believe
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
they
indicated
that
they
would
so
that
they
could
take
an
appeal
from
it
through
the
state
court
system.
judge
lackey,
the
florida
trial
judge
afforded
them
that
right
in
his
letter
of
opinion,
the
letter
of
opinion
that's
complained
of
here
back
on
june
3,
1969
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
they
certainly
could.
it's
–-
they
have
not
done
that
and
the
respondents
have
not
admittedly
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
florida
law
i
believe
is
a
bit
unclear
as
to
that,
as
to
whether
it
would
be
or
not,
but
the
state
court
here
was
perfectly
plain
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
give
them
an
appealable
order.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
were
asked
to
come
into
agreement
with
counsel
for
the
respondent
as
to
the
form
of
the
judgment
to
be
entered
and
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
i'm
sure
will
confirm
this
as
indicated
that
he
does
not
wish
to
join
with
us
in
settling
the
terms
of
a
final
judgment
or
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
believe
we
have
sent
him
a
draft.
we
have
never
taken
the
other
step,
but
he
has
never
given
us
any
comments
on
the
form
of
the
judgment.
i
mean
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor,
the
only
point
we're
trying
to
make
is
that
it's
entirely
within
the
respondent's
power
if
he
wants
to
appeal
judge
lackey's
injunction.
it's
within
-–
entirely
within
his
power
to
do
so,
and
judge
lackey
has
afforded
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
it
could
be.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
respondent
so
requested.
there
was
a
–-
an
extensive
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
in
the
–-
as
many
facts
were
developed
then,
i
believe
this
could
be
developed.
in
1955,
using
as
it
was
then
in
effect,
the
present
version
of
section
2283,
in
the
richman
brothers
case
this
court
made
it
plain
that
litigation
of
the
so-called
labor
preemption
or
labor
supersession,
federal
law
defense
to
a
state
court
proceeding
was
not
an
exception
to
section
2283
simply
because
your
position
was
that
the
state
court
was
moving
in
an
area
where
there
was
preemption
or
supersession
because
of
federal
labor
policy.
that
did
not
give
you
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings.
the
court
there
said
that
there
was
no
additional
implicit
exception
to
be
read
into
section
2283
even
where
the
contention
by
the
party
seeking
the
injunction
was
that
the
state
court
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
having
invaded
a
field
preempted
by
congress
and
let
me
say
that
this
case
i
believe
is
not
even
as
strong
a
case
for
a
federal
court
injunction
as
was
richman
brothers.
in
richman
brothers,
we
had
a
situation
under
the
taft-hartly
act,
the
labor
management
relations
act
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
courts
are
without
jurisdiction.
now,
the
principal
substantive
authority
for
their
preemption
or
supersession
defense
that
the
respondents
are
urging
here
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
the
last
term
where
this
court
expressly
said
that
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
or
that
in
the
circumstances
there
presented
that
the
application
of
their
own
state
substantive
law
had
there
to
yield
because
of
preeminent
federal
policies.
now,
since
there's
no
implicit
exception
for
adjudication
of
the
preemption
or
supersession
defense,
we
turn
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
there
are
two
exceptions
in
the
statute
that
the
respondents
are
citing.
the
first
exception
is
for
injunctions
necessary
in
aid
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
the
revisers
note
in
the
existing
precedence
from
the
pre-1948
era,
and
this
exception
at
least
was
designed
to
carry
forward
the
pre-existing
law,
indicate
that
that
exception
deals
with
two
cases.
first,
you
have
the
removed
case
where
case
is
removed
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court,
and
then
the
state
court
tries
to
go
ahead
with
the
case
as
if
nothing
had
happened.
and
there,
the
authorities
indicate
that
in
order
to
protect
its
jurisdiction,
in
aid
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
it
may
enjoin
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
other
has
to
do
with
fund
or
breaking
the
line,
what
the
courts
call
a
reese,
if
there's
a
particular
fund
than
only
one
court
could
take
jurisdiction
over,
the
exception
is
also
applicable.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
klein
versus
burke
construction
and
princess
lida
v.
thompson
back
before
the
codification
which
this
codification,
we
submit,
carried
forward,
indicate
that
you
may,
despite
that
language,
have
parallel
proceedings
which
seek
general
or
personal
relief
in
the
two
systems
at
the
same
time.
so
here,
there
could
be
a
federal
court
suit
under
federal
law
and
the
state
court
suit
under
state
law.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
proceeding
in
one
doesn't
affront
the
jurisdiction
of
the
other.
the
next
exception
that
they
cite
in
which
i
think
is
the
basis
of
the
primary
reliance
by
the
respondents
is
the
exception
for
injunctions
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
district
court's
judgments.
now,
the
revisers
note
teaches
that
that
was
aimed
to
prevent
re-litigation
by
the
state
courts
of
a
dispute
which
had
been
finally
litigated
by
a
federal
court.
in
effect,
it
was
designed
to
overrule
perhaps
the
high
water
decision
of
this
court's
construction
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
which
was
the
2cv
new
york
life
case
back
in
1941.
the
respondents
have
tried
then
to
characterize
this
case
as
one
where
the
federal
court
was
acting
in
enjoining
these
proceedings
simply
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
they
pointed
to
a
whole
litany
of
proceedings
in
the
federal
court
the
cases
involving
the
government's
suit
against
the
fec
to
which
the
carrier
–-
the
other
carriers
aren't
a
party
and
the
so-called
clark's
case,
which
came
before
this
court
in
1966,
which
was
a
proceeding
which
was
designed
to
see
how
far
the
fec
could
go
in
changing
the
work
rules
with
their
own
employees
during
the
strike.
there
is
no
order
whatsoever
or
judgment
whatsoever
in
any
of
these
other
proceedings
that
we
are
strangers
to,
which
the
respondent
cite
as
being
the
order
the
district
court
was
attempting
to
protect
or
effectuate
here.
we
come
back
to
the
order
which
is
the
one
that
they've
relied
on
throughout,
and
that
is
the
april
26,
1967
order
of
the
federal
district
court,
which
was
the
order
which
denied
the
injunction
to
the
acl
under
federal
law.
now,
that
order
says
nothing
whatsoever
about
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
remedies
in
the
state
court
under
state
law.
indeed,
if
getting
the
injunction
in
the
state
court
affronted
that
order
of
the
federal
court,
it
took
the
respondents
quite
a
long
time
to
complain
of
that
to
the
federal
court.
the
state
court
order
-–
the
federal
court
order
was
entered
in
april,
1967,
the
state
court
order
in
may,
1967.
then
two
years
passed
and
it
was
not
until
1969
that
the
respondents
suggested
that
there
was
something
in
the
1967
order
of
the
federal
court
that
the
state
court
injunction
contravened.
i
think
the
explanation
for
this
delay
is
simple.
what
happened
in
1969
was
this
court's
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
litigation.
what
we
are
trying
-–
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
litigate
in
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
really
with
the
meaning
of
the
district
court's
1967
order.
what
they
are
trying
to
litigate
is
a
preemption
defense
based
upon
the
intervening
decision
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case,
and
that
we
submit
puts
us
into
the
richman
brothers
situation
where
this
court
has
held
that
there
will
be
no
implicit
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
statute
to
permit
–-
to
permit
litigants
to
try
out
the
validity
of
preemption
or
supersession
defenses
against
state
law
proceedings.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
keep
using
those
two
terms,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
it's
either.
it's
the
existence
of
a
federal
law
type
of
defense,
a
federal
privilege
or
a
federal
immunity,
if
you
will,
that
is
urged
as
a
bar
to
the
state
proceeding.
i
think
this
is
a
–-
in
a
fortiori
case
really
from
richman
brothers
if
you
couldn't
try
out
through
an
injunction
proceeding,
our
contention
that
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever,
it
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
from
that
that
you
couldn't
try
out
by
way
of
an
injunction
against
them
whether
there
was
some
sort
of
federal
law
defense.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right
or
wrong.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
was
their
claim,
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
that's
–-
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
that's
-–
that's
simply
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct.
there
are
a
number
of
other
reasons
why
the
injunction
here
is
not
properly
within
the
exception
for
injunctions
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
federal
court's
orders.
in
the
first
place,
the
real
basis
to
us
of
the
federal
court's
denial
of
an
injunction
back
in
1967
to
the
acl
appears
to
be
the
norris-laguardia
act.
virtually,
all
the
cases
which
the
order
cites
are
norris-laguardia
act
cases
and
the
standard
as
well
as
legislative
history
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
makes
it
quite
plain
that
that
act
was
aimed
solely
at
the
federal
courts
and
does
not
take
away
the
remedies
and
rights
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
we
were
to
the
point
where
we
were
discussing
the
--
what
we
take
to
be
the
principle
contention
of
the
respondents
here
and
that
is
that
the
april
26,
1967
order
of
the
federal
district
court
and
that
was
the
order
that
denied
the
atlantic
coast
line
a
preliminary
injunction
that
that
order
was
being
protected
or
effectuated
by
the
subsequent
injunction,
the
1969
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
may
1967
order
of
the
state
court
and
that
on
that
basis,
they
contend
there
is
an
exception
here
from
section
2283.
our
basic
answer
to
that
preposition
is
that
the
federal
district
court
never
purported
to
pass
upon
the
availability
of
state
rights
or
state
remedies
to
the
atlantic
coast
line.
his
decree
amounted
to
a
denial
of
the
injunction,
which
was
sought
solely
under
federal
law.
their
argument
which
was
made
for
the
first
time
two
years
later
that
the
state
injunction
of
may
1967
contravened
the
federal
denial
of
an
injunction
is
we
submit
simply
a
setting
up
of
the
federal
law
defense
based
on
this
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
jacksonville
terminal
against
the
injunction
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
now,
there
are
number
of
subsidiary
reasons
why
that
april
26,
1967
order
could
not
be
the
basis
of
the
claimed
exception
here
from
section
2283.
in
the
first
place
as
we
read
the
order,
there
is
some
dispute
about
it,
but
most
of
the
cases
that
it
cites
are
norris-laguardia
act
cases
and
that
it
appears
to
us
to
proceed
primarily
on
the
basis
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
we
contend
that
the
federal
court
order
simply
declined
an
injunction
by
reason
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
of
course,
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
is
clear
that
it
leaves
open
the
remedies
under
state
law
and
in
the
state
courts.
the
respondents
contend
that
the
federal
court
order
somehow
constituted
a
comprehensive
declaration
of
the
party’s
rights.
and
in
effect,
i
suppose
held
that
coastline,
the
neutral
road
had
no
right
to
injunctive
relief
here
on
any
basis.
on
its
face,
the
order
simply
doesn’t
say
that.
the
most
you
could
say,
if
the
order
were
a
declaration
of
rights
and
we
read
it
that
way
if
at
all
we'd
be
to
this
simply
a
denial
on
the
basis
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
all
it
denied
were
rights
under
federal
law.
there
is
the
further
point
that
it
is
simply
an
order
made
upon
application
for
at
the
most
preliminary
injunction,
indeed
it
might
have
been
an
order
simply
denying
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
record
is
a
little
unclear,
but
giving
the
respondents
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
it's
an
order
the
denying
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
laws,
we
submit
quite
black
letter
on
the
point
that
you
cannot
have
a
determination
of
the
party's
substantive
rights
through
a
preceding
on
a
preliminary
injunction
application.
we
submit
then
that
really
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
adjudicate
this
federal
law
defense,
call
it
preemption
or
super
session
or
maybe
perhaps
simply
called
the
insertion
of
a
federal
law
defense
to
the
state
court
injunction
by
enjoining
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
and
this
we
submit
is
at
the
core
of
what
section
2283
says
that
federal
courts
are
not
to
do.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
he
said
that
since
the
respondents
had
filed
the
hand
written
answer
which
they
did
very
shortly
before
the
notice
of
dismissal
that
it
was
dismissible
as
of
right
and
he
then
declined
to
grant
the
injunct
--
the
order
for
a
voluntary
dismissal
upon
motion.
and
he
said
that
since
the
court
was
of
opinion
that
the
defendants
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
that
is
their
counter
motion
seeking
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceedings
has
merit,
our
motion
for
voluntary
dismissal
will
be
denied.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
on
page
195
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
in
effect,
he
is
assigned
the
reason
that
he
wants
to
pass
an
injunction
against
the
plaintiff
as
a
reason
for
denying
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
back
in
1967,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
it
was
not.
the
case
simply
laid
dormant
for
two
years.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
case
that
we
now
have
before
this
court.
if
the
contentions
that
we
make
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
2283
are
not
well
founded,
the
court
must
still
reach
the
question
whether
the
defense
that
the
respondents
have
urged
to
the
state
court
injunction
is
a
good
defense.
now
of
course,
if
the
court
is
in
agreement
with
us,
that
section
2283
is
applicable
here
and
that
none
of
the
exception
is
applicable,
then
the
court
need
not
reach
this
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
it
certainly
is,
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct.
if
i
might
amplify
a
little
bit
on
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice
yesterday,
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
we
did
not
proceed
to
have
an
final
judgment
entered
ourselves
right
away,
was
that
judge
mccray's
order
out
of
the
federal
district
court
enjoined
us
from
proceeding
further
with
the
state
court
proceedings.
that
injunction
followed
on
the
heels
fairly
closely
of
the
statement
by
the
state
judge
that
he
would
be
willing
to
enter
a
final
order
and
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
he
restrained
us
your
honor
from
taking
any
further
action
in
furtherance
of
the
rights
that
we
have
in
the
state
court
and
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
just
us.
but
the
state
court
judge
indicated
to
one
of
the
parties
to
prepare
a
decree
and
that
went
under
the
federal
court
injunction,
we
were
there
shortly
thereafter.
but
our
position
is
plain,
the
respondents
are
entitled
to
a
final
judgment
that
they
could
feel
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
that's
--
i
think
is
completely
clear
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
we
concede
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
a
final
judgment
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
they
are,
although,
i
can't
speak
for
them.
we
submit
that
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
which
is
the
respondent's
principle,
perhaps,
sole
authority
for
the
preposition
that
they
have
a
federal
law
defense
is
not
applicable
to
the
situation
involved
here
at
the
moncrief
yard,
which
is
a
yard,
wholly
owned
by
the
atlantic
coastline,
a
non-struck
carrier.
now,
we
do
not
intend
to
take
the
liberty
of
parsing
for
the
court's
opinion
rendered
only
one
year
ago,
but
we
do
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
very,
very
extensive
discussion
of
the
very
peculiar
facts
involved
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
in
that
opinion.
the
fact
that,
there
we
had
a
joint
terminal
facility
which
was
jointly
owned
and
jointly
controlled
by
the
carriers
including
the
struck
carrier
and
the
struck
carrier
had
a
right
to
veto
over
the
major
decisions
that
might
be
undertaken
with
respect
to
those
premises.
those
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
you
do
not
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
point
of
argument
at
this
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
should
have
belabored
the
point
but
the
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal
as
we
read
it
at
least,
it
seems
to
us
to
turn
on
these
unique
factors
at
this
jointly
owned
facility.
this
is
a
facility
where
fec
employees
report
for
work
everyday
on
foot
which
was
jointly
controlled
by
them,
which
was
in
effect
the
fec
passenger
terminal
at
the
northern
end,
which
sold
tickets
for
the
fec,
which
were
repaired
fec
cars,
which
performed
extensive
switching
and
rowing
services
for
them.
the
court
discussed
at
some
length
the
analogy
with
the
common
situs
cases
under
the
taft-hartley
act
and
in
effect
as
we
read
the
opinion,
the
court
concluded
that
in
that
context,
the
rather
tangled
involved
context
of
a
joint
facility
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
it
could
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
extent
the
parties
self
help
rights
were
properly
exercisable
and
to
what
extent
they
were
not.
the
court
took
the
view
that
we
submit
in
that
area
at
least
that
that
essentially
had
to
be
a
legislative
judgment.
now
here,
we
have
gone
beyond
the
exercise
of
self
help
rights
against
the
primary
parties
to
the
dispute.
we
have
gone
beyond
the
situation
where
the
primary
party,
the
fec
is
involved
in
the
joint
use
and
control
of
a
terminal
facility.
what
we
have
here
is
essentially
hot
car
picketing.
at
first,
it
did
not
start
out
that
way
and
there
are
still
in
this
court
protestations
that
that
is
not
what
was
going
on.
but
particularly
in
the
last
few
days
of
the
picketing
here,
what
you
had
was
an
attempt
and
a
successful
attempt
to
induce
the
employees
of
the
coastline,
operating
within
the
coastline's
own
yard,
not
to
handle
cars
which
had
originated
on
the
fec,
and
not
to
handle
inbound
cars
coming
down
from
the
north
that
were
ultimately
destined
to
the
fec.
now,
there
is
some
talk
by
the
respondents
that
this
was
done
in
a
limited
way
that
they
only
refused
to
handle
long
solid
blocks
of
cars,
that
they
only
refused
to
make
the
very
next
move
down
to
the
point
where
the
interchange
would
take
place.
but
the
record
is
plain
particularly
in
the
last
few
days
of
the
picketing
that
the
refusals
by
the
employees
went
well
beyond
that.
that
they
were
beyond
simply
involving
this
last
move
down
back
from
the
interchange
point.
that
in
one
case
they
declined
to
move
a
road
train
that
was
destined
up
to
go
through
way
cross
georgia,
which
is
fully
made
up
simply
because
it
had
fec
cars
in
it.
and
in
the
court
below
in
the
--
before
the
state
court
i
should
say,
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
took
the
view
that
this
court's
opinion
in
jacksonville
terminal
was
to
the
effect
that
it
was
no
longer
any
question
of
how
far
you
can
go
or
how
far
you
can't
go,
that
there
was
no
longer
any
body
of
law
available
to
any
employer
doing
business
with
the
fec,
that
would
in
any
way
restrict
their
right
to
picket
his
business.
now,
we
contend
that
if
you
read
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
that
way,
what
you
have
is
picketing
which
i
think
anybody
would
consider
secondary
picketing.
that's
not
a
magic
word,
but
it
is
a
word
that
expresses
sort
of
judgment
about
what
it
is
when
people
who
are
essentially
strangers
to
a
labor
dispute
have
their
businesses
interfered
with
by
the
parties
to
a
labor
dispute.
and
it
is
a
practice
which
the
congress
has
outlawed
and
outlawed
in
increasingly
stringent
terms
for
the
last
23
years,
starting
at
1947.
and
which,
the
legislatures
in
virtually
all
the
states
and
the
state
courts
of
common
law
have
outlawed.
what
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
as
i
understand
is
that
despite
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
taft-hartley
act
is
not
as
we
concede
not
applicable
here
in
the
railroad
industry
that
there
is
no
agency
of
government
state
or
federal,
judicial
or
administrative
that
can
any
way
regulate
or
any
way
deal
with
these
practices
regardless
of
how
far
removed
they
are
from
directly
operating
upon
the
party
that
they
have
the
dispute
with.
in
other
words,
the
hot
car
approach,
or
the
hot
cargo
approach,
or
the
so-called
hot
property
approach
is
outlawed
in
firstly
every
industry
by
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
landrum-griffin
act,
but
not
in
the
railroad
area
and
what
is
more
to
say
the
respondents
that
the
states
cannot
do
anything
about
it
either.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
a
--
i
assume
you
have
those
before
him
because
that
transcript
was
available
to
him
from
the
hearing
two
years
before
and
he
did
refer
two
certain
findings
that
the
use
of
the
moncrief
yard
was
an
integral
and
necessary
part
of
the
fec's
operations,
which
is
clear
if
they
cannot
receive
cars
coming
down
from
the
north
or
if
they
can't,
if
there
is
a
blockage
of
the
way
in
which
their
cars
go
up
to
the
north,
they
simply
can't
operate.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor,
but
of
course
here,
we
do
have
an
independent
owner,
we
have
the
acl
which
is
completely
independent
to
the
fec.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
or
indeed
these
have
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
or
indeed
i
would
think
it
you've
the
same
result
had
they
gone
up
to
way
cross
georgia
or
whatever
the
next
junction
point,
or
the
next
point
where
they
conveniently
could
have
blockaded
the
trains,
getting
through
these
other
points
going
up
to
the
north
are
similarly
integral
and
essential
to
the
fec's
business.
unless
it
can
have
some
way
of
getting
its
cars
through
the
points
that
it
is
suppose
to
get
them
to,
beyond
its
own
line,
it
is
not
going
to
continue
operate.
your
honors,
we
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
we
wouldn't
have
gone
to
state
courts,
but
we
would
have
made
a
similar
argument
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
certainly
would.
i'd
make
the
section
2283
argument.
i
do
not
really
see
how
i
could
make
an
argument
on
the
merits
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
in
support
of
the
state
court's
action
because
that
--
that's
a
very
clear
area.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
to
the
section
2283,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we
submit
lastly
that
if
the
jacksonville
terminal
decision
means
what
the
respondents
say
that
it
means,
it
should
be
reconsidered
by
this
court,
though,
clearly
we
think
the
court
need
not
reach
that
point
at
all.
our
final
contention
takes
us
into
an
area
which
is
relatively
unchartered
by
this
court's
decisions
and
that
is
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
here
as
well
as
section
2283
precludes
the
injunction
that
the
federal
court
granted.
the
relationship
between
the
non-struck
carriers
and
the
rail
unions
has
been
held
by
the
lower
courts
and
this
court
in
a
four
to
four
decision
once
upheld
that
as
being
a
relationship
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
and
hence,
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
by
this
court
and
then
this
case,
the
moncrief
case
by
the
lower
court,
the
non
struck
carriers
have
been
held
not
to
be
entitled
to
have
a
federal
court
injunction.
we
say
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
works
both
ways.
if
the
federal
courts
may
not
pass
an
injunction
against
the
unions,
we
submit
that
in
this
situation,
they
may
not
pass
an
injunction
against
the
non
struck
carriers
restraining
them
from
the
use
of
the
state
courts.
it
is
clear
on
the
face
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
it
does
work
both
ways,
that
it
does
inhibit
injunctions
against
management
just
as
it
inhibits
injunctions
against
unions.
and
in
fact,
we
quote
in
our
brief
considerable
dialog
in
the
floor
of
senate
and
the
house
which
indicate
the
congress
recognized
that
this
was
a
two-edged
sword
when
it
was
passed
back
in
1932.
indeed,
some
of
the
practices
that
can't
be
enjoined
are
practices
that
only
an
employer
could
commit
i.e
joining
an
employer
organization.
so,
we
submit
that
the
very
broad
contention
that
the
respondents
make
that
the
act
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
injunctions
against
management
is
not
correct.
we
also
say
that
section
4
(d)
of
the
statute
makes
it
plain
that
injunctions
against
the
ordinary
course
of
judicial
proceedings
were
one
of
the
evils
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
when
it
passed
the
statute.
that
being
so,
we
are
confronted
with
the
very
flat
prohibition
in
section
7,
which
flatly
restrains
the
courts
of
the
united
states
from
granting
any
injunction
or
labor
dispute
unless
certain
findings
were
made
and
those
findings
were
not
made
here,
including
findings
which
certainly
were
very
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
here.
namely,
there
was
no
finding
that
the
complainant
has
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
certainly
his
appellate
rights
in
florida
state
courts
would
have
precluded
the
making
of
that
finding.
indeed,
there
was
no
attempt
to
comply
of
norris-laguardia
act
at
all.
so
for
this
reason
as
well,
we
contend
that
the
injunction
here
should
not
have
been
granted
against
the
state
court
proceedings
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
your
honors
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
there
is
not.
the
--
we
do
have
a
stay
of
the
federal
court
order
which
is
in
fact
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
milledge
referred
to
a
number
of
other
proceedings
besides
the
case
at
bar
which
presumably
the
district
court
was
protecting
orders
in
--
by
enjoining
the
state
court
proceedings
here.
now,
the
district
court
itself
never
cited
any
of
these
other
cases.
i
don't
believe
they
were
cited
to
it
by
counsel.
they
were
mentioned
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
there
are
three
proceedings
essentially,
one
of
them
is
the
so
called
the
clerks
case
to
which
the
neutral
carriers
are
not
even
a
party.
the
other
is
a
proceeding
in
which
there's
never
been
any
order
entered
of
any
affirmative
or
even
negative
sort
it
and
the
only
other
one
is
this
1963
case
and
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
entered
in
that
and
we
discuss
all
of
these
in
our
brief.
the
only
order
that
has
ever
been
entered
in
that
is
an
order
that
the
fec
got
against
the
atlantic
coastline
and
the
other
neutral
carriers
requiring
them
to
interchange
and
we
scarcely
see
how
the
state
court
order
in
any
way
contravenes
that
order
since
the
picketing
that
the
state
court
sought
to
enjoin
was
designed
to
disrupt
the
interchange
by
getting
the
coastline
stop
the
interchange.
this
case
is
quite
different
than
from
the
looney
case
which
was
mentioned
frequently
by
counsel
in
his
oral
argument.
in
looney,
there
was
an
affirmative
interlocutory
injunction
granted
by
the
federal
court.
then
a
state
court
ordered
the
taking
of
certain
action
which
was
inconsistent,
completely
inconsistent
with
the
federal
court
injunction
and
it
was
held
that
the
federal
court
could
enjoin
proceedings
upon
that
state
court
injunction
notwithstanding
that
the
federal
court
injunction
was
interlocutory.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
there
is
no
order
whatsoever
that
the
injunction
under
review
protects
or
effectuates
the
assertions
of
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
have
been
solely
assertions
as
to
the
federal
law
rights.
there
is
no
diversity,
the
state
law
claims
were
never
pleaded.
we
get
down
to
the
final
point
in
this
case
that
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
adjudicate
this
defense
based
on
their
reading
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
by
way
of
brining
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings.
now,
they
have
stated
that
the
argument
we're
making
is
essentially
a
pigeon
whole
argument
that
they
have
to
point
to
a
specific
exception
to
the
statute.
well
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads,
pigeon
whole
is
a
kind
of
a
tendentious
way
of
saying
it
but
it's
a
general
statute
with
specific
exceptions.
as
the
court
said
in
richman
brothers,
legislative
policy
is
here
expressed
in
section
2283,
in
a
clear
cut
prohibition
qualified
only
by
specifically
defined
exceptions.
the
exception
i
think
that
the
respondents
are
trying
to
urge
on
this
court
is
the
exception
that
we
heard
much
of
the
very
end
of
mr.
milledge's
argument
and
that
is
that
they
just
can't
wait
for
the
orderly
adjudication
of
their
federal
defenses
in
the
state
courts.
they
have
not
joined
with
us
in
entering
a
final
judgment.
they
admit
that
they
could
have
had
one
entered.
they
have
left
that
situation
stand
now
for
nine
months.
they
have
not
lifted
a
finger
to
take
an
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
the
preposition
we
submit
that
the
respondents
are
urging
upon
this
court
cuts
at
the
very
heart
of
what
congress
tried
to
do
back
in
1793
and
ever
since
when
it
is
enacted
and
reenacted
this
statute.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
he
had
purported
to
--
had
purported
to
exercise
the
power
adjudicate
state
law
claims
or
deny
their
existence,
then
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
and
it's
exclusive,
then
we
would
have
quite
a
different
case.
you
could
make
the
argument
that
what
we
were
trying
to
do
then
was
to
re-litigate
that
order
and
that
we
should
have
appealed
that
order.
now,
we
didn't
appeal
his
order
and
if
it
said
something
else
from
what
it
had
said,
presumably
our
decision
as
to
appeal
would
have
been
quite
different.
thank
you
,your
honor.
