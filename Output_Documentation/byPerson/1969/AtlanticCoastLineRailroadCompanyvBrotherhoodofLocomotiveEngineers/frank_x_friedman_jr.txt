mr.
frank
x.
friedman
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
due
to
the
intricate
litigation,
which
is
in
the
background
of
this
case,
and
the
complex
factual
setting
as
well
as
the
unique
procedural
vehicle
which
was
employed
by
the
respondent
brotherhoods
below,
we
will,
with
the
court's
permission,
make
first
a
separate
and
distinct
statement
of
the
facts
and
of
the
procedural
setting
in
this
case,
which
will
then
be
followed
by
mr.
lyons's
argument
of
the
law
as
applied
to
those
facts.
first
to
the
background
and
the
physical
setting
which
we're
dealing
with;
physically,
we
are
dealing
with
the
property
of
three
separate
railroad
carriers.
first,
the
florida
east
coast
railway;
the
florida
east
coast
property
is
located
in
large
part
to
the
south
of
the
st.
johns
river
in
jacksonville,
florida,
although,
it
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
north
bank
of
the
st.
johns
river.
the
second
parcel
of
the
property
we
are
dealing
with
is
located
to
the
north
of
the
fec
property,
and
that
property
is
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
thirdly,
the
property
which
is
directly
involved
here
is
the
moncrief
yard
located
again
north
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
by
way
of
background
and
in
highly
capsule
form
if
i
may,
in
january,
1963,
the
fec
non-operating
employees
went
on
strike
and
began
to
picket
the
fec
property.
in
may
of
1966,
these
pickets
moved
up
the
land
and
across
the
st.
johns
river
and
began
to
picket
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
two
series
of
litigation
resulted
from
that
picketing,
both
of
which
came
before
this
court.
first,
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
sought
an
injunction
and
was
granted
an
injunction
in
federal
court.
that
injunction
was
reversed
due
to
the
bar
of
norris-laguardia
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
this
court
affirmed
full
forward.
secondly,
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
sought
an
injunction
in
the
state
court.
that
injunction
was
granted
and
in
march
of
last
year,
this
court
reversed
by
a
four-
three
decision.
in
the
meantime
however,
and
in
april,
1967,
the
fec
pickets
again
moved
up
the
land
and
placed
pickets
around
the
acl's
moncrief
yard.
moncrief
yard,
the
facility
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
a
wholly-owned
piece
of
property
or
a
piece
of
property
wholly
owned
by
the
acl
which
is
devoted
primarily
to
classification
and
secondarily
to
the
interchange
of
traffic
with
connecting
carriers.
classification
as
the
term
implies
is
the
simple
act
of
breaking
down
a
road
train
which
comes
in
to
the
yard,
putting
it
into
its
separate
classes
and
putting
it
in
a
road
train
which
goes
out
of
the
yard,
it
comes
in
acl
and
goes
out
acl.
the
interchange
procedure,
which
is
used
by
fec
and
acl
in
moncrief
yard
is
also
quite
similar.
the
fec
with
its
locomotives
and
employees
bring
cars
across
the
st.
johns
river
north,
across
the
jacksonville
terminal
company,
and
drop
them
on
a
previously
designated
track
in
moncrief
yard.
and
on
occasions,
they
pick
up
cars
from
moncrief
yard
and
take
them
back
to
their
own
classification
yard
south
of
the
river,
back
on
the
yard.
the
operating
procedure
which
exists
as
to
moncrief
yard
as
well
as
the
relationship
between
acl
and
fec
is,
we
respectfully
submit,
totally
distinguishable
from
the
situation
which
existed
in
the
case
decided
by
this
court
in
march
of
last
year.
in
the
first
place,
the
fec
owns
no
part
of
the
acl
stock
or
no
part
of
acl
property.
secondly,
the
fec
obviously
owns
no
part
of
moncrief
yard
and
had
no
interest,
ownership
wise
in
moncrief
yard.
the
fec
exercises
no
discretion
in
either
the
overall
management
of
acl
or
in
the
management
and
operation
of
moncrief
yard.
the
acl
does
not
maintain
or
repair
any
fec
cars
and
engines,
and
very
importantly,
we
submit
in
this
case,
no
fec
employee
reports
to
or
leaves
from
work
at
the
picketed
premises
moncrief
yard.
the
1967
picketing,
which
is
in
issue
here,
took
place
at
the
acl
employee
entrance
into
moncrief
yard.
the
request,
which
was
made
by
picket
signs,
pamphlets
and
apparently
by
telephone
calls
during
the
night
was
for
acl
employees
to
go
to
work,
but
refuse
to
perform
the
functions
which
they
normally
perform
in
that
yard,
namely
classify
and
interchange
cars
which
are
the
sole
property
of
acl.
there
are
at
least
three
points
which
we
believe
should
be
made
insofar
as
the
picketing
is
concerned.
first,
there's
no
relationship
between
the
picketing,
which
took
place
at
moncrief
yard
in
the
presence
of
fec
in
that
yard.
secondly,
the
intent
of
the
brotherhood
is
obvious
and
was
expressed
by
the
highest
official
insofar
as
the
strike
is
concerned,
and
that
is
to
close
the
acl
because
the
acl
was
doing
business
with
the
fec.
thirdly,
picketing
was
designed
to
force
acl
employees
to
quit
performing
work,
which
they
normally
did
for
the
acl.
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
picketing
and
the
fec
presence
in
the
yard,
there
was
no
relationship
in
time
between
the
picketing
and
the
fec
presence
in
the
yard.
they
picketed
when
the
acl
employees
came
to
work
and
this
was
not
necessarily
at
all
at
the
time
when
fec
employees
or
engines
might
be
in
moncrief
yard.
there
was
no
relationship
in
effect.
the
effect
of
this
picketing
was
to
cause
acl
employees
to
cease
to
handle
acl
cars
and
in
many
instances,
cars
which
were
never
–-
or
never
originated
or
were
not
destined
to
fec.
separation
is
practical
in
this
case.
there
are
more
than
one
place
at
which
these
fec
employees
could
be
picketed
and
the
intent
was
expressed
by
the
head
brotherhood
man
insofar
as
this
strike
is
concerned,
and
i
quote
from
the
appendix
at
page
31,
“he
was
going
to
shut
down
the
coastline
railroad.
”
it
was
in
this
factual
situation
that
the
rather
unique
procedural
complexity
arose.
first
in
1967,
the
acl
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court
based
solely
on
federal
law
and
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
motion
or
request
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied
on
the
grounds
of
the
bar
of
norris-laguardia.
this
action
lay
dormant
from
april
26,
1967
to
may
23,
1969.
subsequently,
the
acl
filed
suit
in
the
state
court,
requesting
an
injunction
solely
under
state
law,
that
injunction
was
granted.
in
march,
1969,
this
court
handed
down
its
opinion
in
trainmen
versus
jacksonville
terminal
and
it's
the
chronology
of
subsequent
events
with
which
this
court
is
primarily
concerned
today.
first,
the
brotherhood
moved
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction,
which
had
been
handed
down
in
1967
and
noticed
a
hearing
for
may
23,
1969.
virtually,
while
this
hearing
was
going
on
in
state
court,
on
the
brotherhood
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction,
a
handwritten
answer
was
filed
by
the
brotherhood
in
the
dormant
federal
case,
and
a
copy
of
that
answer
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
163.
a
second
full
hearing
on
the
merits
was
held
in
state
court
and
judge
lackey
then
issued
a
letter
opinion
which
indicated
that
he
would
deny
the
brotherhood's
motion
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction.
it
was
then
that
the
brotherhood
filed
a
motion
in
the
dormant
federal
case
in
federal
court
requesting
that
the
federal
district
judge
in
effect
enjoin
the
state
court
from
enforcing
its
injunction.
and
the
grounds
of
the
motion
were,
and
i
quote
from
the
appendix
at
page
186,
to
enjoin
acl
from
availing
itself
of
the
state
court
injunction
“pending
final
hearing
and
determination
of
this
[the
federal
action].
”
the
acl
attempted
to
have
the
federal
action
finally
determined
and
in
fact,
immediately
filed
a
notice
of
dismissal.
the
acl
stated
in
open
court
that
it
was
willing
to
have
its
complaint
and
its
case
dismissed
with
prejudice.
the
brotherhood
objected
to
a
dismissal
with
prejudice,
even
though
they
had
not
in
their
handwritten
answer
sought
any
affirmative
or
counter
relief,
and
the
challenged
order
was
entered
on
june
19,
1969,
which
one;
denied
the
acl
the
right
to
dismiss
its
complaint
with
prejudice
and
two;
enjoined
the
state
court
from
enforcing
the
1967
injunction
pending
final
hearing,
in
a
case
in
which
we
respectfully
submit
there
was
nothing
left
to
finally
hear.
we
did
however
seek
a
final
hearing
and
we
were
denied
a
final
hearing
and
it
is
subsequent
to
that
that
we
felt
these
appellate
proceedings
were
commenced.
in
conclusion
as
to
the
facts
and
the
procedural
setting
which
gave
rise
to
this
case,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
procedural
vehicle
of
a
federal
district
judge
enjoining
a
state
court
used
by
the
brotherhood
in
this
case
is
unique
and
does
constitute
a
serious
and
we
believe
a
grave
threat
to
continued
federal
state
judicial
relationships.
the
acl
sought
injunctive
relief
in
federal
court
in
1967,
and
that
relief
was
denied
because
the
court
was
barred
from
acting
under
norris-laguardia.
the
brotherhood
did
not
and
has
never
sought
any
counter
or
affirmative
relief
in
that
case,
and
the
federal
court
did
not
determine
and
could
not
determine
the
legality
of
the
picketing
in
1967.
subsequently,
the
brotherhood
contends
that
somehow,
the
district
–-
the
federal
district
court
in
negatively
denying
the
acl's
requested
relief,
affirmatively
determined
that
the
picketing
was
legal.
it
was
not
however
until
after
the
brotherhood
had
failed
to
prevail
in
state
court
on
its
motion
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction
that
the
brotherhood
took
steps
to
enjoin
the
state
court
to
“protect”
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
intent
was
obvious
and
the
effect
was
obvious,
and
that
was
to
subvert
the
appellate
processes
of
the
state
of
florida,
avoid
normal
appellate
procedures
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
to
seek
directly
a
review
of
a
state
court
circuit
judge
decision
by
a
federal
district
judge.
and
it
is
that
error
legally,
which
with
the
court's
permission,
mr.
lyons
will
commence
discussing
at
this
time,
thank
you.
mr.

there
was
no
relationship

the
effect
of
this
picketing
was
to
cause
acl
employees
to
cease
to
handle
acl
cars
and
in
many
instances,
cars
which
were

or
never

is
concerned,

”
it
was
in
this
factual
situation
that
the
rather
unique
procedural
complexity
arose.
first
in
1967,
the
acl
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court
based
solely
on
federal
law
and
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
motion
or
request
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied
on
the
grounds
of
the
bar
of
norris-laguardia.
this
action
lay
dormant
from
april
26,
1967
to
may
23,
1969.
subsequently,
the
acl
filed
suit
in
the
state
court,
requesting
an
injunction
solely
under
state
law,
that
injunction
was
granted.
in
march,
1969,
this
court
handed
down
its
opinion
in
trainmen
versus
jacksonville
terminal
and
it's
the
chronology
of
subsequent
events
with
which
this
court
is
primarily
concerned
today.
first,
the
brotherhood
moved
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction,
which
had
been
handed
down
in
1967
and
noticed
a
hearing
for
may
23,
1969.
virtually,
while
this
hearing
was
going
on
in
state
court,
on
the
brotherhood
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction,
a
handwritten
answer
was
filed
by
the
brotherhood
in
the
dormant
federal
case,
and
a
copy
of
that
answer
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
163.
a
second
full
hearing
on
the
merits
was
held
in
state
court
and
judge
lackey
then
issued
a
letter
opinion
which
indicated
that
he
would
deny
the
brotherhood's
motion
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction.
it
was
then
that
the
brotherhood
filed
a
motion
in
the
dormant
federal
case
in
federal
court
requesting
that
the
federal
district
judge
in
effect
enjoin
the
state
court
from
enforcing
its
injunction.
and
the
grounds
of
the
motion
were,
and
i
quote
from
the
appendix
at
page
186,
to
enjoin
acl
from
availing
itself
of
the
state
court
injunction
“pending
final
hearing
and
determination
of
this
[the
federal
action].
”
the
acl
attempted
to
have
the
federal
action
finally
determined
and
in
fact,
immediately
filed
a
notice
of
dismissal.
the
acl
stated
in
open
court
that
it
was
willing
to
have
its
complaint
and
its
case
dismissed
with
prejudice.
the
brotherhood
objected
to
a
dismissal
with
prejudice,
even
though
they
had
not
in
their
handwritten
answer
sought
any
affirmative
or
counter
relief,
and
the
challenged
order
was
entered
on
june
19,
1969,
which
one;
denied
the
acl
the
right
to
dismiss
its
complaint
with
prejudice
and
two;
enjoined
the
state
court
from
enforcing
the
1967
injunction
pending
final
hearing,
in
a
case
in
which
we
respectfully
submit
there
was
nothing
left
to
finally
hear.
we
did
however
seek
a
final
hearing
and
we
were
denied
a
final
hearing
and
it
is
subsequent
to
that
that
we
felt
these
appellate
proceedings
were
commenced.
in
conclusion
as
to
the
facts
and
the
procedural
setting
which
gave
rise
to
this
case,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
procedural
vehicle
of
a
federal
district
judge
enjoining
a
state
court
used
by
the
brotherhood
in
this
case
is
unique
and
does
constitute
a
serious
and
we
believe
a
grave
threat
to
continued
federal
state
judicial
relationships.
the
acl
sought
injunctive
relief
in
federal
court
in
1967,
and
that
relief
was
denied
because
the
court
was
barred
from
acting
under
norris-laguardia.
the
brotherhood
did
not
and
has
never
sought
any
counter
or
affirmative
relief
in
that
case,
and
the
federal
court
did
not
determine
and
could
not
determine
the
legality
of
the
picketing
in
1967.
subsequently,
the
brotherhood
contends
that
somehow,
the
district
–-
the
federal
district
court
in
negatively
denying
the
acl's
requested
relief,
affirmatively
determined
that
the
picketing
was
legal.
it
was
not
however
until
after
the
brotherhood
had
failed
to
prevail
in
state
court
on
its
motion
to
dissolve
the
state
court
injunction
that
the
brotherhood
took
steps
to
enjoin
the
state
court
to
“protect”
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
intent
was
obvious
and
the
effect
was
obvious,
and
that
was
to
subvert
the
appellate
processes
of
the
state
of
florida,
avoid
normal
appellate
procedures
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
to
seek
directly
a
review
of
a
state
court
circuit
judge
decision
by
a
federal
district
judge.
and
it
is
that
error
legally,
which
with
the
court's
permission,
mr.
lyons
will
commence
discussing
at
this
time,
thank
you.
