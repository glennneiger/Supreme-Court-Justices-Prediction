mr.
allan
milledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
demonstrate
in
our
argument
that
this
case,
this
injunction
issued
by
judge
mccray
against
inconsistent
state
court
action
is
not
an
isolated
case,
but
it
arises
out
of
a
totality
of
regulation
of
the
florida
east
coast
dispute
that
goes
back
to
1964
and
involves
every
aspect
of
this
strike
including
regulation
of
good
faith
bargaining,
regulation
of
the
self
help
rights
of
the
railroad,
regulation
of
the
self
help
rights
of
the
unions,
the
actual
operations
of
the
railroad
itself,
and
that
all
of
these
are
interrelated
and
all
bear
upon
each
other.
mr.
allan
milledge
not
violent
picketing,
but
--
mr.
allan
milledge
with
that
exception.
with
the
--
that
exception
--
mr.
allan
milledge
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
case
that
that
is
not
only
preempted
or
that
a
state
law
may
not
apply
in
that
field
--
mr.
allan
milledge
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
it
is
--
as
we
interpret
the
opinion,
it
is
protected
conduct
to
engage
in
whatever
reasonable
conduct
that
the
organizations
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
railway
--
mr.
allan
milledge
in
the
opinion,
there's
the
area
of
course
of
damages
which
would
be
an
area
that
the
federal
court
could
deal
with.
but
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
of
the
last
term
is,
as
we
read
it,
that
there
is
no
limitation
upon
the
self
help
rights
so
long
as
they
are
reasonable
and
that
is
a
matter
that
has
been
of
before
the
district
courts,
a
number
of
times
and
i
think
i
can
develop
also
the
interrelationship.
the
second
thing
that
we
will
demonstrate
is
that
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
enjoin
the
state
court
action
here
under
2283
in
this
court's
opinions
is
beyond
question
that
it
has
that
power.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
--
mr.
allan
milledge
we
think
that
with
the
two
--
really,
there
is
only
one
provision
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
applies
to
management
and
that
is
the
one
he
sited
about
employer
organizations.
but,
we
think
our
basic
position
on
that
is
that
the
tail
will
go
with
the
hide,
that
once
the
2283
problem
is
dealt
with,
the
norris-laguardia
act
problem
--
the
norris-laguardia
act
just
basically
is
not
designed
for
this
type
of
a
problem
and
will
develop
that
later,
but
our
position
is
not
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
can
not
apply
to
an
employer.
now,
the
third
position
that
we
will
develop
is
that
this
case
is
the
strongest
case
for
the
application
that
is
the
should
aspects.
we
will
demonstrate
that
there
is
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
do
this,
but
this
is
the
strongest
case
for
the
application
of
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
that
has
ever
come
before
this
court
or
a
lower
court
in
a
reported
opinion
and
it
is
a
stronger
case
for
the
granting
of
such
injunction
than
any
reported
case
granting
one.
in
connection
with
the
totality
of
regulation
of
--
by
the
federal
court,
there
are
four
separate
cases,
cases
that
is
with
separate
file
numbers,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
which,
is
aided
by
this
injunction
and
orders
are
need
to
protection
of
this
injunction.
now,
the
types
of
matters
which
have
been
before
the
court
below
are
absolutely
legend.
this
court
recalls
the
clerk's
case
that
was
before
this
court,
that
was
a
case
brought
by
the
united
states
government.
it
is
a
case
in
which
it
was
determined
that
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
for
the
first
two
years
of
its
operations,
its
post
strike
operation
was
operating
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
an
order
entered
in
that
case
requiring
good
faith
bargaining.
there
was
an
order
in
that
case
granting
to
the
railroad
certain
limited
exceptions
or
deviations
from
its
collective
bargaining
contracts
in
aid
of
its
self-help
rights.
that
case
still
pends
that
there
is
a
trial
commencing
our
final,
another
final
hearing
in
that
case
commencing
the
first
week
of
april
to
go
on
for
all
of
april
and
all
of
may
and
the
issues
are
again,
the
good
faith
bargaining
that
is
all
in
contempt
citations,
the
good
faith
bargaining,
massive
violations
of
the
injunction
since
the
strike,
and
on
other
issues.
all
of
that
still
pends
and
the
good
faith
order,
the
good
faith
order
depends
on
economic
sanctions.
as
justice
--
mr.
justice
brennan
has
written
in
the
insurance
agents
case,
and
has
written
in
other
cases
too,
and
it
is
in
the
galveston
wharves
case
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
same
area
of
2282,
that
bargaining,
the
motive
power
in
bargaining
is
economic
sanctions.
now
in
this
case,
that
is
the
florida
east
coast
strike,
there
are
as
there
are
in
all
railroad
or
other
situations
two
types
of
economic
sanction.
one
is
the
withdrawal
of
your
people
at
the
commencement
of
the
strike
and
the
second
type
is
picketing
aimed
at
those
persons,
the
employees
or
persons
making
pick
ups
and
deliveries
to
the
struck
employer.
its
--
in
other
industries,
it's
more
general
than
that,
but
in
the
railroad
industry,
the
place
where
you
put
the
pressure
on
is
where
the
railroad
gets
its
freight
from
another
railroad.
now,
from
the
commencement
of
this
strike
up
until
the
present,
there
has
not
with
the
exception
of
a
few
hours
in
1966
and
a
few
hours
in
1967
any
use
of
the
economic
sanction
to
stop
pick
ups
and
deliveries
from
other
railroads
by
asking
the
employees
of
other
railroads
not
to
do
so.
that
has
been
prevented
by
an
injunction
initially
issued
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
to
florida
and
that
is
another
case
in
which
in
that
case
still
pends.
now
mr.
lyons
in
his
brief
has
talked
about
that
case.
that's
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
district
court
has
assumed
jurisdiction
over
interchange
and
the
organizations,
labor
organizations
were
never
allowed
to
get
into
that
case,
and
as
they
say,
it
mandates
interchange.
now,
what
is
happened
since
that
time
is,
there
was
a
lawsuit
filled
in
1965
by
the
organizations
to
construe
that
injunction
as
not
to
apply
to
employees
who
had
--
of
the
connecting
carriers.
then
in
1966,
the
trainmen
strike
against
--
the
trainmen
picketing
of
the
terminal
area
began
and
effectively,
there
was
a
construction
of
that
assumed
jurisdiction
over
interchange
to
initially
not
permit
picketing
of
the
terminal
company
and
ultimately
to
permit
picketing
of
the
terminal
company.
and
then
in
1967,
in
this
case
with
the
different
file
number
nonetheless,
the
court
has
again,
but
with
a
different
file
number
assumed
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
and
i
say
in
this
case
we,
it
is
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
can
picket
the
moncrief
yard.
all
of
these
cases
are
all
interrelated
and
they
all
have
impact
back
and
forth
on
each
other.
mr.
allan
milledge
if
there
were
--
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
that
had
been
assumed
by
the
united
states
district
court
or
no
orders
that
needed
to
be
protected
or
effectuated,
i
would
say
that
we
could
not.
now,
the
difference
--
mr.
allan
milledge
i
think
that
we
could.
i
think
that
we
could
have
gone
into
the
government's
case,
the
good
faith
bargaining
nexus
is
exactly
the
same
there
as
it
is
in
the
galveston
wharves
case,
which
we
will
discuss
after
a
bit.
we
could
have
gone
in
if
permitted
into
the
case
in
which
there
was
already
assumed
jurisdiction.
the
--
what's
called
the
6316
case
or
the
initial
case
assuming
jurisdiction
over
interchange.
once
in
as
we
come
later
as
i'll
get
into
as
quickly
as
i
can
into
the
2283
question,
once
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
controversy,
wherein
far
enough
so
that
an
injunction
maybe
issued.
now
in
a
case
like
that,
you
probably
wouldn't
get
into
the
area
of
should
it
be
issued.
this
case
makes
as
we'll
show
later
an
overwhelming
posture
for
the
“should
aspect”
of
it,
but
what
the
statute
says
on
the
could
or
the
power
is
simply
a
case
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
a
jurisdiction
or
a
case
in
which
an
order
needs
protecting
or
effectuating,
that's
what
the
congress
say.
mr.
allan
milledge
petitioner
is
a
party
to
all
of
the
interchange
actions.
mr.
allan
milledge
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
--
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
all
the
railroads
are
--
mr.
allan
milledge
--
to
the
initial
case
upon
which
the
federal
court
assumed
and
mandated
interchange.
all
of
the
carriers
are,
possibly
southern
is
not,
but
atlantic
coastline,
the
seaboard,
of
course
it
is
all
one
railroad
now,
and
the
jacksonville
terminal
are
all
parties
to
that
and
the
southern
was
too,
i
recall
that
southern
--
mr.
allan
milledge
it
was
--
it
is
and
that's
the
petition
that
is
the
complaint
was
filed
in
that
case
on
january
27,
four
days
after
the
strike
commenced
by
the
fec
against
these
other
carriers
saying
that,
they
--
the
other
carriers
were
refusing
interchange
that
they
had
imposed
an
embargo
and
indeed
they
had
imposed
an
embargo
and
the
labor
organizations
were
not
parties,
but
the
justification
given
by
the
defendant
railroads,
that
is
the
other
railroads,
was
--
if
there
was
a
labor
dispute
and
that
these
people,
that
is
our
people
would
picket
the
interchange
and
so
they
want
--
mr.
allan
milledge
alright.
that,
the
injunction
in
that
case
applies
to
the
atlantic
coastline
and
its
employees,
the
terminal
company
and
its
employees.
now,
that
is
an
injunction
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
over
the
question
of
interchange
and
it
applies
to
employees
as
well.
mr.
allan
milledge
we
would
be
by
intervention
but
the
question
is
a
question
simply
of
how
does
2283
read.
for
instance,
in
the
capital
service
case
--
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
way
--
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
now,
the
way
we
actually
went
about
it,
the
way
we
went
about
it
was
in
1965,
we
filed
another
case
to
construe
--
we
sought
intervention
and
we
are
denied
and
judge
tuttle
discusses
that
in
the
case,
one
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
cases.
so,
then
we
filed
a
suit
to
construe
it.
mr.
allan
milledge
before
the
same
judge
in
the
same
court.
now,
that
one
didn't
reach
any
file
determination
because
in
the
mean
time
in
1966,
the
trainmen
went
on
strike
and
began
to
picket
the
terminal
which
was
nominally
in
violation
of
the
injunction
and
the
same
judge,
judge
mccray
and
enjoined
it
initially
and
then
later
reversed
--
his
injunction
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
so,
that
for
--
as
a
practical
matter
that
that
original
case,
6316,
the
original
embargo
injunction
case
has
been
modified
by
the
1966
case
and
by
the
1967
case,
this
case
is
presently
before
the
court.
all
of
which
deal
with
these
really
the
same
problems,
the
interchange
between
the
connecting
carriers
and
this
railroad.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
our
basic
answer
is
that
judge
mccray
has
--
as
he
says,
“determined
the
rights
of
the
parties.”
in
this
order
on
appeal,
he
says,
“i
delineated
the
rights
of
the
parties.
i
did
make
a
substantive
determination
between
the
parties.”
now
assume
that,
he
was
wrong
about
that,
that
he
really
hadn't
done
that,
that
mr.
lyons
is
somehow
right
that
all
his
order
was
was
an
norris-laguardia
order.
certainly,
he
has
assumed
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
he's
had
jurisdiction
to
do
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
require
that
there
be
a
judgment
to
be
construed,
to
be
protected
or
effectuated.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
--
were
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
--
mr.
allan
milledge
we
--
there
--
we
rely
on
both
of
them
because
they
are
both
in
point.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
even
if
his
1967
order
wasn't
an
order
that
required
protection
in
first
place,
well,
even
if
it
was
and
we
say
it
was
because
he
says
it
was.
even
if
it
wasn't,
he
certainly
had
assumed
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
legality
of
this
conduct.
so,
he
certainly
has
the
jurisdiction.
now,
we've
heard
over
here
that
everything
was
done,
everything
was
done
in
this
litigation
to
entitle
them
to
a
final
judgment.
i
forget
the
exact
terms,
but
you
recall
what
mr.
lyons
says,
talked
about
it
and
says
mr.
friedman
that
after
this
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceeding
was
entered
that
they
asked
judge
scott,
the
other
district
judge,
to
either
set
it
aside
or
to
give
them
a
final
judgment
because
everything
that
had
been
done,
all
the
facts
were
in
and
all
he
had
to
do
is
just
enter
a
file
of
order.
i
mean
that's
true,
i
mean,
that's
where
the
case
is.
it
is
a
question
of
either
our
conduct
is
legal
or
illegal,
judge
mccray
says
his
ruled
that
its
legal
conduct
and
when
he
made
that
ruling
back
in
1967
and
this
is
along
the
line
that
there
is
a
judgment
to
protect
or
effectuate.
he
--
this
court
had
not
yet
ruled
in
jacksonville
terminal,
but
you
will
see
in
his
opinion
or
order
that
he
cites
section
20
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
this
court
has
heard
about
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
from
us
since
1966
that
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
as
discussed
by
the
hutcheson
case
in
norris-laguardia
breathing
life
back
in
the
clayton,
it's
been
our
position
on
legality
from
the
beginning.
and
that's
what
judge
mccray
said
in
his
order
in
1967
and
that
was
before
the
order
of
this
court
to
be
sure,
but
that
is
what
his
determination
was.
he
determined
that
norris-laguardia
applied,
but
he
went
much
further
than
that.
he
also
in
terms
of
this
order
being
an
order
which
is
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate,
he
cites
--
defines
that
we
were
engaged
in
a
major
dispute
and
he
cites
the
b&o
case,
which
is
a
standard
fairly
recent
then,
casing
that
once
you
had
exhausted
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act,
once
there
was
a
major
dispute,
then
you
are
entitled
to
self
help.
you
had
a
legal
right
to
self
help.
now,
the
content
of
self
help
is
something
else,
but
it's
--
we
--
it
is
certainly
been
said
often
enough
by
this
court
that
--
that
self
help
implies
as
it
does
--
as
it
must,
since
there
is
the
duty
to
bargain
in
the
act,
it
must
imply
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing.
now,
he
cited
the
b&o
case,
this
is
a
major
dispute,
he
talks
about
what
we
did.
now,
i
haven't
got
into
the
facts
and
i
may
never
have
a
chance
to
get
very
far
into
the
facts,
but
we've
heard
over
and
over
again
and
this
court
has
heard
over
and
over
again,
this
great
tale
of
horror.
the
world
is
going
to
come
to
an
end.
now,
since
1963,
one
road
train
has
been
32
minutes
late
and
the
yard
in
this
case
was
15
hours
late.
but
that's
all
that's
ever
happened
and
all
that
has
ever
happened
is
that
the
--
in
the
exact
place
where
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
ends,
and
i
am
not
talking
about
ownership,
i'm
talking
about
where
its
railroad
trains
run?
in
this
case,
they
run
into
the
atlantic
coastline
property
where
they
complete
their
business.
they
make
a
delivery
and
they
make
pick
ups
in
the
employees
of
the
neutral.
the
atlantic
coastline,
are
people
that
under
any
idea
of
primary
picketing,
we
are
entitled
to
ask,
“don't
pick
up
and
do
not
make
deliveries
to
the
primary.”
now,
this
happens
to
be
a
case.
this
moncrief
yard
picketing
in
which
every
effort
was
made
to
limit
the
manner
of
picketing
so
that
it
would
have
the
effect
only
on
pick
ups
and
deliveries.
now,
we
didn't
even
use
a
picket
line.
if
we
put
a
picket
line
up
at
the
one
and
only
entrance,
the
only
place
that
employees
of
atlantic
coastline
go
to
work
in
the
moncrief
yard
is
at
this
one
employee
entrance.
if
we
put
a
picket
line
there,
those
employees
whose
duty
it
is
to
make
pick
ups
and
deliveries
to
the
fec
within
that
yard,
where
the
fec
engines
come,
no
other
place
to
reach
those
people,
if
we
will
put
a
picket
line
there,
that
closes
the
yard
down.
now,
there
is
this
assertion
over
here
made
that
that's
really
what
we
had
in
mind
doing
that
we
just
want
to
close
the
yard
down.
and
what
we
did,
i
might
say
was
we
let
the
people
go
to
work,
we
just
asked
them
simple
thing,
“don't
handle
the
interchange”
and
that
is
what
they
did.
now,
that
relates
back
because
that's
what
judge
mccray
found
in
his
order,
now,
i'll
show
you
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
--
mr.
allan
milledge
it
really
--
no,
it
is
really
doesn't.
this
conduct
here
in
question,
however,
is
more
primary
than
the
conduct
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
case,
that's
about
all
it
really
does
go
to.
we
are
not
some
villains
that
are
out
to
close
down
the
world
or
close
down
the
railroad
or
anything
else.
we
do
want
to
apply
the
economic
power,
the
economic
sanctions
to
the
place
where
the
railroad
gets
its
traffic.
it
doesn't
go
really
any
farther
than
that
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
milledge
or
the
norris-laguardia.
mr.
allan
milledge
no,
sir.
now,
just
to
go
because
there
was
this
business
about
we
want
to
close
the
yard
down
or
something
that's
what
they
say
over
and
over
in
the
brief.
they
quote
a
man
named
jeanneth
who
is
quoting
a
man
named
sims,
jeanneth
is
their
overall
man
and
sims
is
our
overall
man.
now
of
course,
mr.
sims
testified
and
as
judge
mccray
found
all
we
were
doing
was
stopping
the
interchange
movements.
but
mr.
jeanneth
in
cross-examination
said,
my
question
to
him
was
and
you
had
some
conversations
i
believe,
i
am
reading
from
page
109
of
the
appendix,
and
you
had
some
conversations
i
believe
with
other
different
union
people
or
at
least,
they
were
there
like
mr.
sims
answered.
i
talk
to
you
and
to
mr.
sims
question,
“you
understood
did
you
not
that
the
purpose
of
this
activity
was
only
to
stop
fec
traffic?”
and
sir,
“that
was
my
understanding.
yes
sir.”
that's
the
man
there
quoting
earlier
for
that,
we
were
going
to
close
the
world
down.
now,
in
connection
--
well
i
just
might,
since
i
got
started
on
it,
just
tell
you
that
judge
mccray's
order,
the
order
of
1967,
paragraph
number
six
which
is
on
page
66
of
the
appendix,
finds
if
that
is
what
we
were
doing.
that
we
were
asking
people
not
to
make
pick
ups
and
not
to
make
deliveries
and
that
was
that.
now
--
mr.
allan
milledge
alright.
the
galveston
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
this
past
term,
the
picketing
very
similar
to
this
on
the
grounds
the
state
enjoined
to
the
secondary
and
the
nexus
was
a
good
faith
bargain
order.
there
is
that
case,
there
is
the
capital
service
case.
capital
service
is
a
case
which
came
before
richman
brothers.
and
in
capital
service,
the
board
had
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
hadn't
entered
any
orders
at
all,
but
had
invoked
it,
invoked
the
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
entering
some
orders
pertaining
to
alleged
secondary
conduct.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
proper
under
2283
then
the
injunction
against
the
state
court
was
proper
to
unfetter
the
federal
court
so
that
it
could
make
a
determination.
there
is
that
case,
there's
--
i
have
a
list,
if
i
can
pick
them
up
quickly.
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
the
looney
case
is
the
case
that
this
one
--
this
case
is
most
similar
to.
it's
very
similar
--
this
case
is
very
similar
to
really
three
cases.
it's
very
similar
to
galveston
wharves.
it's
very
similar
to
capital
service
because
the
difference
there,
the
board
invoked
the
jurisdiction
as
only
the
board
can
under
that
act.
here,
it
is
private
parties
who
may
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
but
the
looney
case
is
case
that
goes
back
quite
a
number
of
years,
but
the
looney
case
is
a
case
in
which
this
court
approved
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
case
--
state
court
injunction
in
a
texas
rate
dispute
that
is
the
way
i
think
of
it
in
any
event.
and
that
case,
the
looney
case
is
discussed,
it
is
quite
significant
because
it
is
like
capital
service
in
that
an
injunction
was
issued,
it
was
in
aid
of
jurisdiction
but
of
the
court
rather
than
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
judgment.
but
the
looney
case
is
of
particular
significance
because
it
is
discussed
at
length
in
the
toucey
decision.
the
justice
frankfurter
opinion
for
the
court,
and
justice
reed's
opinion
for
the
minority,
and
in
both
the
majority
and
the
minority,
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
about
looney.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
said
that,
that
case
was
granted
merely
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
until
the
suit
brought
by
the
carriers
was
finally
settled.
now
the
significance
of
that
is
this.
2283,
mr.
lyons
has
suggested
to
us
that
2283
has
a
lot
of
pigeon
holes
and
this
does
not
fit
a
pigeon
hole.
the
pigeon
hole
for
a
race,
there
is
a
pigeon
whole
for
a
removed
case,
there
is
a
pigeon
hole
for
fully
adjudicated
case
and
that
is
all
he
said,
the
pigeon
holes
were
in
his
main
brief.
now,
a
lot
of
cases
don't
happen
to
fit
in
those
pigeon
holes,
but
2283
isn't
a
pigeon
whole
statute.
the
history
of
2283
is
that,
it
initially
was
a
flat
blanket
statement
by
the
congress,
“the
district
court
shall
not
enjoin
state
courts”
and
then
eventually
the
bankruptcy
addition
came
into
it.
and
then
finally
in
1948,
it
was
changed
because
of
toucey,
but
what
had
this
court
done
in
the
mean
time?
this
court
had
said
that
obviously,
there
are
situations
in
which
it
is
necessary
that
having
jurisdiction,
a
district
court
has
got
general
equity
jurisdiction
in
it
has
got
to
be
able
to
protect
that
jurisdiction.
and
so,
various
cases
came
along
and
looney
was
one
of
them
that
where
it
was
necessary
to
protect
the
jurisdiction.
now,
justice
frankfurter
in
1941
in
the
toucey
case
said
that,
the
policy
against
enjoining
state
courts
was
so
great
that
even
a
fully
litigated
case
that
was
a
money
judgment
diversity
case,
but
the
policy
of
the
united
states
against
enjoining
state
courts
was
great
enough
to
require
somebody
who
would
fully
litigated
the
matter
in
the
federal
courts
to
go
ahead
and
just
plead
res
judicata
and
go
on
all
the
way
up
again
through
the
state
system
and
back
around.
now,
that
was
reversed
by
congress
and
they
--
so,
you
no
longer,
you
have
an
entirely
different
statutory
format
starting
in
1948.
it
isn't
a
question
anymore
of
the
court
having
to
look
to
its
some
general
equity
considerations,
but
the
congress
has
said
and
the
reviser
says
the
same
thing
and
they
do
not
limit
it
to
pigeon
holes,
but
particularly
the
language
of
congress,
a
district
court
may
enjoin
where
necessary
in
aid
of
jurisdiction
or
to
protect
and
effectuate
judgments.
you
have
both
here
and
really
the
question
is
the
question
of
the
should
aspect.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
what
our
position
is
with
regard
to
the
state
court
matter
is
that
whatever
that
court
does
or
does
not
do,
right,
wrong
or
indifferent
that
that
impinges
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
which
was
assumed
to
make
those
determinations.
mr.
allan
milledge
we
also
say
that
it
did
happen.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
we
now
know
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
federal
court
could
deal
with
the
state
law
problem.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
if
(f)
under
asco
decision
of
this
court,
what
you
plead
is
a
set
of
operative
facts?
you
do
not
plead
all
this
business
that
comes
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
the
federal
court
couldn't
deal
with
the
state
court
with
state
law.
mr.
allan
milledge
no,
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
there
is
no
longer
a
state
law
question
but
i
would
assert
base
upon
last
year's
determination
of
this
court.
but
at
that
time,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
as
it
did
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
could
use
whatever
body
of
law
that
there
was
that
was
applicable
under
pendent
jurisdiction
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
district
courts
of
the
united
states
everyday
apply
state
law
and
it
is
usually
in
diversity
cases,
but
they
also
apply
state
law
in
pendent
jurisdiction
cases
where
in
this
case
it
would
be
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
allan
milledge
that
is
what
we
say
he
did.
mr.
allan
milledge
correct,
yes.
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
defendants
can
win,
i
mean,
the
position
that
mr.
lyons
is
“if
you
don't
rule
for
the
plaintiff
and
don't
grant
an
injunction,
then
nothing
has
happened.”
defendants
can
never
have
the
benefit
of
this
doctrine
or
benefit
of
protection
if
it
had
been
--
let
us
say
a
fully
litigated
case
with
res
judicata,
i
suppose
that
would
be
something
different,
but
that
somehow
if
the
defendant
gets
rules
for
that
that
isn't
an
order
requiring
some
kind
of
protection.
well,
he
did
rule
the
question
of
the
legality,
the
issue
of
legality
of
our
conduct
was
submitted
to
judge
mccray
in
1967,
about
that,
there
can
be
no
question.
now,
there
was
a
question
up
until
this
past
year
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
independent
state
remedy
as
it
was
thought
that
could
intrude
into
railway
labor.
now
as
long
as
that
was
the
case,
and
there
the
suggestion
is
made,
well,
if
it
required
protection
--
if
it
is
what
you
say
it
is,
why
didn't
you
go
in
1967?
well,
you're
into
the
area
then
of
the
question
of
really
a
should
preposition.
until
this
court
has
ruled
and
incidentally
the
arrangement
was
with
counsel
that
we
would
let
the
1967
picketing
cases
lie
until
this
court
had
ruled
and
when
this
court
had
ruled
within
about
two
weeks
we
were
in
before
judge
locke.
so,
why
the
reason
for
not
going
in,
in
1967
is
that
a
federal
district
court
with
that
question
remaining
as
an
open
question
would
be
reluctant
to
enjoin
not
because
it
couldn't,
not
because
it
didn't
interfere
but
because
that
just
would
not
--
you
never
get
somebody
to
do
it
is
really
what's
involved,
but
once
its
clear
that
that
interferes
it's
not
a
question
of
trying
a
res
judicata
defense,
it's
not
a
question
of
under
the
statute,
it
is
not
question
of
any
of
those
things.
it's
simply
a
question
that
the
state
court
action
fetters
the
federal
court
in
making
its
determination
or
it
is
contrary
or
in
some
--
it
does
not
really
even
need
to
be
contrary
as
long
as
it's
necessary
to
some
reason
or
to
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
take
action
and
here,
that
is
really
very
clear.
now,
it
is
said
by
mr.
lyons
that
richman
brothers
ends
the
matter
and
that
richman
brothers
says
that
there
is
a
forbidden
fruit
here
that
you
can't
try
a
preemption
court
--
a
defense
in
the
federal
district
court,
that
you
got
to
let
that
go
on
up.
well,
that
isn't
what
richman
brothers
says.
in
richman
brothers,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court.
that
jurisdiction
had
been
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
anywhere
around.
so,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
aid
and
no
order
should
have
been
entered.
so,
2283
could
not
apply.
it
really
is
just
about
as
simple
as
that.
now,
the
language
--
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
“the
should”
area
is
justice
frankfurter
again
writing
the
author
of
toucey
and
he
writes
a
lots
of
reasons
why
it
shouldn't
be
done.
but
fundamentally,
it
all
does
come
back
down
to
the
question
of
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
aid
or
a
judgment
or
order
to
be
protected.
now,
professor
moore
has
something
to
say
about
this.
professor
moore
says
the
--
and
this
is
on
page
43
of
our
brief,
“the
second
exception
permits
a
federal
court
to
grant
an
injunction
against
state
proceedings
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.”
this
puts
back
into
2283
some
of
the
judicial
flexibility
which
toucey
had
removed
from
the
statute.
and
despite
the
strict
reading
of
2283
by
richman
brothers,
flexibility
still
remains
for
richmond
as
we
shall
see
held
only
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
aid.
but
if
on
the
other
hand
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
then
under
the
terms
of
2283,
it
may
enjoin
state
court
proceedings
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
now,
since
that
time
there
has
been
the
galveston
wharves
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
possible
that
it
is
very
round
decision
is
since
that
time
as
well
which
--
but
perhaps
not.
the
galveston
wharves
decision
was
a
case
like
the
fec
in
this
regard
that
it
had
been
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
three
times.
it
is
--
it
was
a
case
that
had
spawned
considerable
litigation.
the
state
court
had
enjoined
picketing,
the
federal
court
had
mandated
that
the
carrier
engage
in
good
faith
bargaining.
the
federal
court
enjoined
the
state
court
from
enjoining
the
picketing
because
of
the
impact
that
that
would
have
regardless
of
considerations
of
secondary
conduct
and
galveston
again
was
a
decision
before
this
court's
decision
in
jacksonville
terminal
and
that
case
is
essentially
in
terms
of
the
power
under
2283,
essentially
the
same
case
as
this
one.
the
sperry
rand
case
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
in
that
case
an
injunction
was
issued
against
the
state
court
to
protect
a
discovery
order
of
the
federal
court.
in
the
brown
versus
pacific
mutual
case,
which
is
a
case
which
goes
back
prior
to
the
1948
amendments,
justice
parker
issued
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
or
rather
he
affirmed
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
in
a
case
which
only
involved
cancellation
of
an
insurance
policy.
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
was
for
cancellation,
the
suit
in
the
state
court
was
on
a
$450.00
claim
arising
under
the
policy
and
he
discusses
at
great
length
and
this
is
back
when
there
were
no
exceptions
to
2283.
he
discusses
the
kline
case
which
is
a
case
kline,
and
toucey,
and
richmond
are
really
the
cases
most
often
talked
about,
but
when
you
come
through
all
of
it
and
that
injunction
was
sustained,
but
it
never
reached
this
court,
but
when
you
come
down
really
to
all
of
it,
certainly
the
looney
case
is
still
the
law.
the
looney
case
does
not
fit
into
any
body's
pigeon
hole.
the
looney
case
is
simply
a
case
in
aid
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
what
the
respondents
say
about
looney
and
the
sperry
rand
case.
what
they
teach
is
that
an
interlocutory
order
of
a
federal
court
is
as
much
entitle
to
protection
by
injunction
against
interference
from
a
state
court
as
a
final
order.
that's
certainly
true
under
looney.
looney
--
the
principles
of
looney
were
certainly
carried
forward
and
probably
broadened
in
the,
but
at
least
carried
forward
in
the
48
revision,
and
that
is
certainly
within
the
language
of
2283.
now,
the
reason
that
this
case
is
the
strongest
case
that
of
any
case
for
the
application
of
2283
is
this.
there
are
at
least
0
or
40
separate
cases
the
district
court
has
had,
innumerable
cases
involving
this.
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
opinions
that,
i
don't
think
you
can
number
on
two
hands.
all
of
these
matters
ultimately
come
down
to
one
thing
that
the
florida
east
coast
strike
will
be
settled
only
if
there
is
bargaining,
when
you
finally
come
down
to
it.
now,
there
has
been
no
economic
power,
no
economic
sanction
that
could
be
put
to
bear
upon
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
since
the
first
two
years
of
the
strike,
except
the
economic
sanction
of
asking
the
employees
of
the
neutral
railroads
not
deliver
cars
to
the
fec.
now
in
a
situation
like
this
and
what,
the
reason
really
i
think
that
the
economic
sanctions
initially
didn't
bring
any
kind
of
settlement,
was
because
the
fec
immediately
started
all
these
illegal
operations
for
which
there
is
a
proceedings
now
about
restoration
of
the
status
quo
and
so
forth,
but
they
effectively
through
illegal
conduct
wanted
that,
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
atlantic
coastline.
but
also
from
the
very
beginning,
the
other
form
of
primary
activity
and
surely
there
must
some
way
in
the
railroad
industry
that
you
are
entitled
to
ask
the
people
who
make
pick
ups
and
deliveries
in
the
terms
of
the
steelworker
case
or
in
the
terms
of
this
court
last
year
not
to
do
that
and
of
course,
one
knows
that
in
this
industry
that
they
won't
do
it
if
you
ask
them
not
to.
so,
there
is
an
economic
power
that
has
never
been
used.
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
decided
that
state
courts
have
no
business
in
this
field.
that
interferes
with
not
only
the
federal
scheme,
but
that
interferes
and
with
jurisdiction
assumed
over
the
bargaining,
over
the
self
help
rights
of
the
railroad
and
over
the
question
not
only
of
interchange
between
the
carriers,
but
interchange
as
it
affects
the
rights
of
this
people
and
it
is
all
one
ball
of
wax.
but
if
for
instance,
let
us
assumed
that
a
state
court
tells
the
federal
court
that
the
railroad
cannot
deviate
one
iota
from
its
contract
and
we
know
that
judge
simpson
who
is
originally
the
district
judge
following
the
mandate
of
this
court,
allowed
the
railroad
to
get
away
in
its
operations
from
certain
matters,
i
forget
exactly
what
they
were
to
long,
but
some
matters
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
any
hesitation,
i
dare
say,
that
that
injunction
by
a
state
court
would
come
within
2283
and
be
stopped.
and
this
is
simply
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
the
only
reason
it
looks
any
different
in
perspective
is
because
the
order
says,
“okay,
do
it.”
or
at
least,
“i'm
not
going
to
give
relief
against
it”
and
so
you
can
say,
well
that
isn't
some
kind
of
an
affirmative
duty,
but
it
bears
on
it
--
the
court
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
legality
of
this
conduct
and
as
a
state
court
order
that
impinges
upon
that
and
it
isn't
tangential
at
all,
it's
the
heart
of
the
whole
business
and
no
bargaining
will
ever
make
any
sense
until
the
day
that
there
is
some
economic
power
on
the
part
of
the
organizations.
i
mean,
the
basic
dispute
still
pends
it's
over
10
cents
an
hour.
a
demand
made
in
1961
and
for
10
cents
an
hour
the
hold
up
strike
can
be
settled
for
10
cents
an
hours
in
an
economy
that
from
1961
to
1969
has
expanded
25
--
on
inflation
25%.
i
mean,
so
something
is
wrong
in
this
strike
and
it
is
that
this
traditional
weapon
of
labor,
primary
picketing
against
people
who
make
deliveries
and
pick
ups
has
never
been
able
to
be
applied.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
i
think
that
in
the
totality
of
this
situation
that
with
the
perspective
in
the
first
place.
the
perspective
of
the
statute
is
not
litigant's
contentions
or
anything
else.
the
perspective
of
the
statute
is
the
power
of
the
court
and
it's
whether
the
power
of
the
court
depends
on
whether
it
is
assumed
jurisdiction
and
it
has
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
bargaining
orders
which
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
capital
service
case,
this
case,
if
that
were
so
if
there
was
no
prior
litigation
at
all,
i
believe
that
is
your
assumption
of
no
litigation
at
all,
you
would
then
have
a
situation
which
is
like
the
capital
service
case.
the
difference
would
be
in
capital
service,
it
is
the
board
that
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
then
in
the
capital
service,
the
court
unfettered
itself
first.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
it
is
private
litigants
who
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
a
determination
under
the
railway
labor
act.
and
if
capital
service
is
analogized
to
the
railway
labor
act,
then
an
initial
proceeding
brought
by
a
private
litigant
to
have
the
federal
court
determine
a
question
of
railway
labor
act
law
would
be
entitled,
once
the
court
had
assumed
jurisdiction
to
do
that
would
be
within
2283.
now,
that
doesn't
make
a
stronger
case
for
the
“should
aspect”
as
we
have
in
this
case
because
of
the
totality
of
all
of
the
different
factors.
now,
it
has
been
said
several
times
all
we
need
to
do
is
just
go
ahead
and
follow
our
appellate
remedies
and
it
is
true
the
appellate
remedies
are
there
and
we
can
take
an
appeal
and
we'll
get
back
around
here.
mr.
allan
milledge
oh,
yes
we
can.
well,
if
judge
locke
would
do
what
he
said
he
would
his
letter
and
enter
a
final
judgment,
we
could
appeal
from
that,
that's
quite
true.
that
is
true
in
every
2283
case
and
that
doesn't
affect
the
policy
of
2283,
and
that
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
way
to
deal
with
a
labor
dispute.
if
a
federal
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
and
had
orders,
then
we'll
be
back
here
two
years
from
now
so
that
this
court
can
say
that
jacksonville
terminal,
when
it
says
that
state
law
can
apply,
means
act,
and
then
when
some
state
judge
wants
to
take
jurisdiction
over
something
again,
well,
we'd
be
back
in
another
two
years
after
that
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
the
federal
interest
in
the
settlement
of
the
florida
east
coast
strike
is
enormous.
the
federal
government
has
been
in
the
case
since
the
beginning
not
the
one
with
this
case
number
on
it.
it
does
affect
whole
regions
and
to
have
that
procedure
and
that's
really
what
the
decision
i
think
that
this
court
comes
down
to,
really
the
question
that
is,
is
this
the
type
of
a
case,
like
a
money
judgment
case
in
a
--
it's
already
been
determined
that
toucey
was
wrong
that
fully
litigated
diversity,
but
personal
money
judgment
case
that
you
could
and
should
enjoin
a
state
court.
congress
said
that,
congress
was
upset
to
think
that
you
couldn't
do
that.
now
--
mr.
allan
milledge
but
this
case
if
that's
so,
then
this
case
is
just
overwhelming
for
that
in
--
i
didn't
discuss
the
norris-laguardia
act
at
all,
but
our
position
is
stated
in
the
brief.
mr.
allan
milledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
demonstrate
in
our
argument
that
this
case,
this
injunction
issued
by
judge
mccray
against
inconsistent
state
court
action
is
not
an
isolated
case,
but
it
arises
out
of
a
totality
of
regulation
of
the
florida
east
coast
dispute
that
goes
back
to
1964
and
involves
every
aspect
of
this
strike
including
regulation
of
good
faith
bargaining,
regulation
of
the
self
help
rights
of
the
railroad,
regulation
of
the
self
help
rights
of
the
unions,
the
actual
operations
of
the
railroad
itself,
and
that
all
of
these
are
interrelated
and
all
bear
upon
each
other.
mr.
allan
milledge
not
violent
picketing,
but
--
mr.
allan
milledge
with
that
exception.
with
the
--
that
exception
--
mr.
allan
milledge
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
case
that
that
is
not
only
preempted
or
that
a
state
law
may
not
apply
in
that
field
--
mr.
allan
milledge
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
it
is
--
as
we
interpret
the
opinion,
it
is
protected
conduct
to
engage
in
whatever
reasonable
conduct
that
the
organizations
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
railway
--
mr.
allan
milledge
in
the
opinion,
there's
the
area
of
course
of
damages
which
would
be
an
area
that
the
federal
court
could
deal
with.
but
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
of
the
last
term
is,
as
we
read
it,
that
there
is
no
limitation
upon
the
self
help
rights
so
long
as
they
are
reasonable
and
that
is
a
matter
that
has
been
of
before
the
district
courts,
a
number
of
times
and
i
think
i
can
develop
also
the
interrelationship.
the
second
thing
that
we
will
demonstrate
is
that
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
enjoin
the
state
court
action
here
under
2283
in
this
court's
opinions
is
beyond
question
that
it
has
that
power.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
--
mr.
allan
milledge
we
think
that
with
the
two
--
really,
there
is
only
one
provision
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
applies
to
management
and
that
is
the
one
he
sited
about
employer
organizations.
but,
we
think
our
basic
position
on
that
is
that
the
tail
will
go
with
the
hide,
that
once
the
2283
problem
is
dealt
with,
the
norris-laguardia
act
problem
--
the
norris-laguardia
act
just
basically
is
not
designed
for
this
type
of
a
problem
and
will
develop
that
later,
but
our
position
is
not
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
can
not
apply
to
an
employer.
now,
the
third
position
that
we
will
develop
is
that
this
case
is
the
strongest
case
for
the
application
that
is
the
should
aspects.
we
will
demonstrate
that
there
is
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
do
this,
but
this
is
the
strongest
case
for
the
application
of
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
that
has
ever
come
before
this
court
or
a
lower
court
in
a
reported
opinion
and
it
is
a
stronger
case
for
the
granting
of
such
injunction
than
any
reported
case
granting
one.
in
connection
with
the
totality
of
regulation
of
--
by
the
federal
court,
there
are
four
separate
cases,
cases
that
is
with
separate
file
numbers,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
which,
is
aided
by
this
injunction
and
orders
are
need
to
protection
of
this
injunction.
now,
the
types
of
matters
which
have
been
before
the
court
below
are
absolutely
legend.
this
court
recalls
the
clerk's
case
that
was
before
this
court,
that
was
a
case
brought
by
the
united
states
government.
it
is
a
case
in
which
it
was
determined
that
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
for
the
first
two
years
of
its
operations,
its
post
strike
operation
was
operating
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
there
was
an
order
entered
in
that
case
requiring
good
faith
bargaining.
there
was
an
order
in
that
case
granting
to
the
railroad
certain
limited
exceptions
or
deviations
from
its
collective
bargaining
contracts
in
aid
of
its
self-help
rights.
that
case
still
pends
that
there
is
a
trial
commencing
our
final,
another
final
hearing
in
that
case
commencing
the
first
week
of
april
to
go
on
for
all
of
april
and
all
of
may
and
the
issues
are
again,
the
good
faith
bargaining
that
is
all
in
contempt
citations,
the
good
faith
bargaining,
massive
violations
of
the
injunction
since
the
strike,
and
on
other
issues.
all
of
that
still
pends
and
the
good
faith
order,
the
good
faith
order
depends
on
economic
sanctions.
as
justice
--
mr.
justice
brennan
has
written
in
the
insurance
agents
case,
and
has
written
in
other
cases
too,
and
it
is
in
the
galveston
wharves
case
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
same
area
of
2282,
that
bargaining,
the
motive
power
in
bargaining
is
economic
sanctions.
now
in
this
case,
that
is
the
florida
east
coast
strike,
there
are
as
there
are
in
all
railroad
or
other
situations
two
types
of
economic
sanction.
one
is
the
withdrawal
of
your
people
at
the
commencement
of
the
strike
and
the
second
type
is
picketing
aimed
at
those
persons,
the
employees
or
persons
making
pick
ups
and
deliveries
to
the
struck
employer.
its
--
in
other
industries,
it's
more
general
than
that,
but
in
the
railroad
industry,
the
place
where
you
put
the
pressure
on
is
where
the
railroad
gets
its
freight
from
another
railroad.
now,
from
the
commencement
of
this
strike
up
until
the
present,
there
has
not
with
the
exception
of
a
few
hours
in
1966
and
a
few
hours
in
1967
any
use
of
the
economic
sanction
to
stop
pick
ups
and
deliveries
from
other
railroads
by
asking
the
employees
of
other
railroads
not
to
do
so.
that
has
been
prevented
by
an
injunction
initially
issued
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
to
florida
and
that
is
another
case
in
which
in
that
case
still
pends.
now
mr.
lyons
in
his
brief
has
talked
about
that
case.
that's
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
district
court
has
assumed
jurisdiction
over
interchange
and
the
organizations,
labor
organizations
were
never
allowed
to
get
into
that
case,
and
as
they
say,
it
mandates
interchange.
now,
what
is
happened
since
that
time
is,
there
was
a
lawsuit
filled
in
1965
by
the
organizations
to
construe
that
injunction
as
not
to
apply
to
employees
who
had
--
of
the
connecting
carriers.
then
in
1966,
the
trainmen
strike
against
--
the
trainmen
picketing
of
the
terminal
area
began
and
effectively,
there
was
a
construction
of
that
assumed
jurisdiction
over
interchange
to
initially
not
permit
picketing
of
the
terminal
company
and
ultimately
to
permit
picketing
of
the
terminal
company.
and
then
in
1967,
in
this
case
with
the
different
file
number
nonetheless,
the
court
has
again,
but
with
a
different
file
number
assumed
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
and
i
say
in
this
case
we,
it
is
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
can
picket
the
moncrief
yard.
all
of
these
cases
are
all
interrelated
and
they
all
have
impact
back
and
forth
on
each
other.
mr.
allan
milledge
if
there
were
--
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
that
had
been
assumed
by
the
united
states
district
court
or
no
orders
that
needed
to
be
protected
or
effectuated,
i
would
say
that
we
could
not.
now,
the
difference
--
mr.
allan
milledge
i
think
that
we
could.
i
think
that
we
could
have
gone
into
the
government's
case,
the
good
faith
bargaining
nexus
is
exactly
the
same
there
as
it
is
in
the
galveston
wharves
case,
which
we
will
discuss
after
a
bit.
we
could
have
gone
in
if
permitted
into
the
case
in
which
there
was
already
assumed
jurisdiction.
the
--
what's
called
the
6316
case
or
the
initial
case
assuming
jurisdiction
over
interchange.
once
in
as
we
come
later
as
i'll
get
into
as
quickly
as
i
can
into
the
2283
question,
once
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
controversy,
wherein
far
enough
so
that
an
injunction
maybe
issued.
now
in
a
case
like
that,
you
probably
wouldn't
get
into
the
area
of
should
it
be
issued.
this
case
makes
as
we'll
show
later
an
overwhelming
posture
for
the
“should
aspect”
of
it,
but
what
the
statute
says
on
the
could
or
the
power
is
simply
a
case
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
a
jurisdiction
or
a
case
in
which
an
order
needs
protecting
or
effectuating,
that's
what
the
congress
say.
mr.
allan
milledge
petitioner
is
a
party
to
all
of
the
interchange
actions.
mr.
allan
milledge
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
--
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
all
the
railroads
are
--
mr.
allan
milledge
--
to
the
initial
case
upon
which
the
federal
court
assumed
and
mandated
interchange.
all
of
the
carriers
are,
possibly
southern
is
not,
but
atlantic
coastline,
the
seaboard,
of
course
it
is
all
one
railroad
now,
and
the
jacksonville
terminal
are
all
parties
to
that
and
the
southern
was
too,
i
recall
that
southern
--
mr.
allan
milledge
it
was
--
it
is
and
that's
the
petition
that
is
the
complaint
was
filed
in
that
case
on
january
27,
four
days
after
the
strike
commenced
by
the
fec
against
these
other
carriers
saying
that,
they
--
the
other
carriers
were
refusing
interchange
that
they
had
imposed
an
embargo
and
indeed
they
had
imposed
an
embargo
and
the
labor
organizations
were
not
parties,
but
the
justification
given
by
the
defendant
railroads,
that
is
the
other
railroads,
was
--
if
there
was
a
labor
dispute
and
that
these
people,
that
is
our
people
would
picket
the
interchange
and
so
they
want
--
mr.
allan
milledge
alright.
that,
the
injunction
in
that
case
applies
to
the
atlantic
coastline
and
its
employees,
the
terminal
company
and
its
employees.
now,
that
is
an
injunction
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
over
the
question
of
interchange
and
it
applies
to
employees
as
well.
mr.
allan
milledge
we
would
be
by
intervention
but
the
question
is
a
question
simply
of
how
does
2283
read.
for
instance,
in
the
capital
service
case
--
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
way
--
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
now,
the
way
we
actually
went
about
it,
the
way
we
went
about
it
was
in
1965,
we
filed
another
case
to
construe
--
we
sought
intervention
and
we
are
denied
and
judge
tuttle
discusses
that
in
the
case,
one
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
cases.
so,
then
we
filed
a
suit
to
construe
it.
mr.
allan
milledge
before
the
same
judge
in
the
same
court.
now,
that
one
didn't
reach
any
file
determination
because
in
the
mean
time
in
1966,
the
trainmen
went
on
strike
and
began
to
picket
the
terminal
which
was
nominally
in
violation
of
the
injunction
and
the
same
judge,
judge
mccray
and
enjoined
it
initially
and
then
later
reversed
--
his
injunction
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
so,
that
for
--
as
a
practical
matter
that
that
original
case,
6316,
the
original
embargo
injunction
case
has
been
modified
by
the
1966
case
and
by
the
1967
case,
this
case
is
presently
before
the
court.
all
of
which
deal
with
these
really
the
same
problems,
the
interchange
between
the
connecting
carriers
and
this
railroad.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
our
basic
answer
is
that
judge
mccray
has
--
as
he
says,
“determined
the
rights
of
the
parties.”
in
this
order
on
appeal,
he
says,
“i
delineated
the
rights
of
the
parties.
i
did
make
a
substantive
determination
between
the
parties.”
now
assume
that,
he
was
wrong
about
that,
that
he
really
hadn't
done
that,
that
mr.
lyons
is
somehow
right
that
all
his
order
was
was
an
norris-laguardia
order.
certainly,
he
has
assumed
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
he's
had
jurisdiction
to
do
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
require
that
there
be
a
judgment
to
be
construed,
to
be
protected
or
effectuated.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
--
were
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
--
mr.
allan
milledge
we
--
there
--
we
rely
on
both
of
them
because
they
are
both
in
point.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
even
if
his
1967
order
wasn't
an
order
that
required
protection
in
first
place,
well,
even
if
it
was
and
we
say
it
was
because
he
says
it
was.
even
if
it
wasn't,
he
certainly
had
assumed
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
legality
of
this
conduct.
so,
he
certainly
has
the
jurisdiction.
now,
we've
heard
over
here
that
everything
was
done,
everything
was
done
in
this
litigation
to
entitle
them
to
a
final
judgment.
i
forget
the
exact
terms,
but
you
recall
what
mr.
lyons
says,
talked
about
it
and
says
mr.
friedman
that
after
this
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceeding
was
entered
that
they
asked
judge
scott,
the
other
district
judge,
to
either
set
it
aside
or
to
give
them
a
final
judgment
because
everything
that
had
been
done,
all
the
facts
were
in
and
all
he
had
to
do
is
just
enter
a
file
of
order.
i
mean
that's
true,
i
mean,
that's
where
the
case
is.
it
is
a
question
of
either
our
conduct
is
legal
or
illegal,
judge
mccray
says
his
ruled
that
its
legal
conduct
and
when
he
made
that
ruling
back
in
1967
and
this
is
along
the
line
that
there
is
a
judgment
to
protect
or
effectuate.
he
--
this
court
had
not
yet
ruled
in
jacksonville
terminal,
but
you
will
see
in
his
opinion
or
order
that
he
cites
section
20
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
this
court
has
heard
about
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
from
us
since
1966
that
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
as
discussed
by
the
hutcheson
case
in
norris-laguardia
breathing
life
back
in
the
clayton,
it's
been
our
position
on
legality
from
the
beginning.
and
that's
what
judge
mccray
said
in
his
order
in
1967
and
that
was
before
the
order
of
this
court
to
be
sure,
but
that
is
what
his
determination
was.
he
determined
that
norris-laguardia
applied,
but
he
went
much
further
than
that.
he
also
in
terms
of
this
order
being
an
order
which
is
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate,
he
cites
--
defines
that
we
were
engaged
in
a
major
dispute
and
he
cites
the
b&o
case,
which
is
a
standard
fairly
recent
then,
casing
that
once
you
had
exhausted
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act,
once
there
was
a
major
dispute,
then
you
are
entitled
to
self
help.
you
had
a
legal
right
to
self
help.
now,
the
content
of
self
help
is
something
else,
but
it's
--
we
--
it
is
certainly
been
said
often
enough
by
this
court
that
--
that
self
help
implies
as
it
does
--
as
it
must,
since
there
is
the
duty
to
bargain
in
the
act,
it
must
imply
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing.
now,
he
cited
the
b&o
case,
this
is
a
major
dispute,
he
talks
about
what
we
did.
now,
i
haven't
got
into
the
facts
and
i
may
never
have
a
chance
to
get
very
far
into
the
facts,
but
we've
heard
over
and
over
again
and
this
court
has
heard
over
and
over
again,
this
great
tale
of
horror.
the
world
is
going
to
come
to
an
end.
now,
since
1963,
one
road
train
has
been
32
minutes
late
and
the
yard
in
this
case
was
15
hours
late.
but
that's
all
that's
ever
happened
and
all
that
has
ever
happened
is
that
the
--
in
the
exact
place
where
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
ends,
and
i
am
not
talking
about
ownership,
i'm
talking
about
where
its
railroad
trains
run?
in
this
case,
they
run
into
the
atlantic
coastline
property
where
they
complete
their
business.
they
make
a
delivery
and
they
make
pick
ups
in
the
employees
of
the
neutral.
the
atlantic
coastline,
are
people
that
under
any
idea
of
primary
picketing,
we
are
entitled
to
ask,
“don't
pick
up
and
do
not
make
deliveries
to
the
primary.”
now,
this
happens
to
be
a
case.
this
moncrief
yard
picketing
in
which
every
effort
was
made
to
limit
the
manner
of
picketing
so
that
it
would
have
the
effect
only
on
pick
ups
and
deliveries.
now,
we
didn't
even
use
a
picket
line.
if
we
put
a
picket
line
up
at
the
one
and
only
entrance,
the
only
place
that
employees
of
atlantic
coastline
go
to
work
in
the
moncrief
yard
is
at
this
one
employee
entrance.
if
we
put
a
picket
line
there,
those
employees
whose
duty
it
is
to
make
pick
ups
and
deliveries
to
the
fec
within
that
yard,
where
the
fec
engines
come,
no
other
place
to
reach
those
people,
if
we
will
put
a
picket
line
there,
that
closes
the
yard
down.
now,
there
is
this
assertion
over
here
made
that
that's
really
what
we
had
in
mind
doing
that
we
just
want
to
close
the
yard
down.
and
what
we
did,
i
might
say
was
we
let
the
people
go
to
work,
we
just
asked
them
simple
thing,
“don't
handle
the
interchange”
and
that
is
what
they
did.
now,
that
relates
back
because
that's
what
judge
mccray
found
in
his
order,
now,
i'll
show
you
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
--
mr.
allan
milledge
it
really
--
no,
it
is
really
doesn't.
this
conduct
here
in
question,
however,
is
more
primary
than
the
conduct
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
case,
that's
about
all
it
really
does
go
to.
we
are
not
some
villains
that
are
out
to
close
down
the
world
or
close
down
the
railroad
or
anything
else.
we
do
want
to
apply
the
economic
power,
the
economic
sanctions
to
the
place
where
the
railroad
gets
its
traffic.
it
doesn't
go
really
any
farther
than
that
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
milledge
or
the
norris-laguardia.
mr.
allan
milledge
no,
sir.
now,
just
to
go
because
there
was
this
business
about
we
want
to
close
the
yard
down
or
something
that's
what
they
say
over
and
over
in
the
brief.
they
quote
a
man
named
jeanneth
who
is
quoting
a
man
named
sims,
jeanneth
is
their
overall
man
and
sims
is
our
overall
man.
now
of
course,
mr.
sims
testified
and
as
judge
mccray
found
all
we
were
doing
was
stopping
the
interchange
movements.
but
mr.
jeanneth
in
cross-examination
said,
my
question
to
him
was
and
you
had
some
conversations
i
believe,
i
am
reading
from
page
109
of
the
appendix,
and
you
had
some
conversations
i
believe
with
other
different
union
people
or
at
least,
they
were
there
like
mr.
sims
answered.
i
talk
to
you
and
to
mr.
sims
question,
“you
understood
did
you
not
that
the
purpose
of
this
activity
was
only
to
stop
fec
traffic?”
and
sir,
“that
was
my
understanding.
yes
sir.”
that's
the
man
there
quoting
earlier
for
that,
we
were
going
to
close
the
world
down.
now,
in
connection
--
well
i
just
might,
since
i
got
started
on
it,
just
tell
you
that
judge
mccray's
order,
the
order
of
1967,
paragraph
number
six
which
is
on
page
66
of
the
appendix,
finds
if
that
is
what
we
were
doing.
that
we
were
asking
people
not
to
make
pick
ups
and
not
to
make
deliveries
and
that
was
that.
now
--
mr.
allan
milledge
alright.
the
galveston
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
this
past
term,
the
picketing
very
similar
to
this
on
the
grounds
the
state
enjoined
to
the
secondary
and
the
nexus
was
a
good
faith
bargain
order.
there
is
that
case,
there
is
the
capital
service
case.
capital
service
is
a
case
which
came
before
richman
brothers.
and
in
capital
service,
the
board
had
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
hadn't
entered
any
orders
at
all,
but
had
invoked
it,
invoked
the
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
entering
some
orders
pertaining
to
alleged
secondary
conduct.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
proper
under
2283
then
the
injunction
against
the
state
court
was
proper
to
unfetter
the
federal
court
so
that
it
could
make
a
determination.
there
is
that
case,
there's
--
i
have
a
list,
if
i
can
pick
them
up
quickly.
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
the
looney
case
is
the
case
that
this
one
--
this
case
is
most
similar
to.
it's
very
similar
--
this
case
is
very
similar
to
really
three
cases.
it's
very
similar
to
galveston
wharves.
it's
very
similar
to
capital
service
because
the
difference
there,
the
board
invoked
the
jurisdiction
as
only
the
board
can
under
that
act.
here,
it
is
private
parties
who
may
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
but
the
looney
case
is
case
that
goes
back
quite
a
number
of
years,
but
the
looney
case
is
a
case
in
which
this
court
approved
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
case
--
state
court
injunction
in
a
texas
rate
dispute
that
is
the
way
i
think
of
it
in
any
event.
and
that
case,
the
looney
case
is
discussed,
it
is
quite
significant
because
it
is
like
capital
service
in
that
an
injunction
was
issued,
it
was
in
aid
of
jurisdiction
but
of
the
court
rather
than
to
protect
or
effectuate
a
judgment.
but
the
looney
case
is
of
particular
significance
because
it
is
discussed
at
length
in
the
toucey
decision.
the
justice
frankfurter
opinion
for
the
court,
and
justice
reed's
opinion
for
the
minority,
and
in
both
the
majority
and
the
minority,
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
about
looney.
justice
frankfurter
in
that
case
said
that,
that
case
was
granted
merely
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
until
the
suit
brought
by
the
carriers
was
finally
settled.
now
the
significance
of
that
is
this.
2283,
mr.
lyons
has
suggested
to
us
that
2283
has
a
lot
of
pigeon
holes
and
this
does
not
fit
a
pigeon
hole.
the
pigeon
hole
for
a
race,
there
is
a
pigeon
whole
for
a
removed
case,
there
is
a
pigeon
hole
for
fully
adjudicated
case
and
that
is
all
he
said,
the
pigeon
holes
were
in
his
main
brief.
now,
a
lot
of
cases
don't
happen
to
fit
in
those
pigeon
holes,
but
2283
isn't
a
pigeon
whole
statute.
the
history
of
2283
is
that,
it
initially
was
a
flat
blanket
statement
by
the
congress,
“the
district
court
shall
not
enjoin
state
courts”
and
then
eventually
the
bankruptcy
addition
came
into
it.
and
then
finally
in
1948,
it
was
changed
because
of
toucey,
but
what
had
this
court
done
in
the
mean
time?
this
court
had
said
that
obviously,
there
are
situations
in
which
it
is
necessary
that
having
jurisdiction,
a
district
court
has
got
general
equity
jurisdiction
in
it
has
got
to
be
able
to
protect
that
jurisdiction.
and
so,
various
cases
came
along
and
looney
was
one
of
them
that
where
it
was
necessary
to
protect
the
jurisdiction.
now,
justice
frankfurter
in
1941
in
the
toucey
case
said
that,
the
policy
against
enjoining
state
courts
was
so
great
that
even
a
fully
litigated
case
that
was
a
money
judgment
diversity
case,
but
the
policy
of
the
united
states
against
enjoining
state
courts
was
great
enough
to
require
somebody
who
would
fully
litigated
the
matter
in
the
federal
courts
to
go
ahead
and
just
plead
res
judicata
and
go
on
all
the
way
up
again
through
the
state
system
and
back
around.
now,
that
was
reversed
by
congress
and
they
--
so,
you
no
longer,
you
have
an
entirely
different
statutory
format
starting
in
1948.
it
isn't
a
question
anymore
of
the
court
having
to
look
to
its
some
general
equity
considerations,
but
the
congress
has
said
and
the
reviser
says
the
same
thing
and
they
do
not
limit
it
to
pigeon
holes,
but
particularly
the
language
of
congress,
a
district
court
may
enjoin
where
necessary
in
aid
of
jurisdiction
or
to
protect
and
effectuate
judgments.
you
have
both
here
and
really
the
question
is
the
question
of
the
should
aspect.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
what
our
position
is
with
regard
to
the
state
court
matter
is
that
whatever
that
court
does
or
does
not
do,
right,
wrong
or
indifferent
that
that
impinges
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
which
was
assumed
to
make
those
determinations.
mr.
allan
milledge
we
also
say
that
it
did
happen.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
we
now
know
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
federal
court
could
deal
with
the
state
law
problem.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
if
(f)
under
asco
decision
of
this
court,
what
you
plead
is
a
set
of
operative
facts?
you
do
not
plead
all
this
business
that
comes
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
the
federal
court
couldn't
deal
with
the
state
court
with
state
law.
mr.
allan
milledge
no,
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
there
is
no
longer
a
state
law
question
but
i
would
assert
base
upon
last
year's
determination
of
this
court.
but
at
that
time,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
as
it
did
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
could
use
whatever
body
of
law
that
there
was
that
was
applicable
under
pendent
jurisdiction
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
district
courts
of
the
united
states
everyday
apply
state
law
and
it
is
usually
in
diversity
cases,
but
they
also
apply
state
law
in
pendent
jurisdiction
cases
where
in
this
case
it
would
be
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
allan
milledge
that
is
what
we
say
he
did.
mr.
allan
milledge
correct,
yes.
mr.
allan
milledge
yes.
defendants
can
win,
i
mean,
the
position
that
mr.
lyons
is
“if
you
don't
rule
for
the
plaintiff
and
don't
grant
an
injunction,
then
nothing
has
happened.”
defendants
can
never
have
the
benefit
of
this
doctrine
or
benefit
of
protection
if
it
had
been
--
let
us
say
a
fully
litigated
case
with
res
judicata,
i
suppose
that
would
be
something
different,
but
that
somehow
if
the
defendant
gets
rules
for
that
that
isn't
an
order
requiring
some
kind
of
protection.
well,
he
did
rule
the
question
of
the
legality,
the
issue
of
legality
of
our
conduct
was
submitted
to
judge
mccray
in
1967,
about
that,
there
can
be
no
question.
now,
there
was
a
question
up
until
this
past
year
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
independent
state
remedy
as
it
was
thought
that
could
intrude
into
railway
labor.
now
as
long
as
that
was
the
case,
and
there
the
suggestion
is
made,
well,
if
it
required
protection
--
if
it
is
what
you
say
it
is,
why
didn't
you
go
in
1967?
well,
you're
into
the
area
then
of
the
question
of
really
a
should
preposition.
until
this
court
has
ruled
and
incidentally
the
arrangement
was
with
counsel
that
we
would
let
the
1967
picketing
cases
lie
until
this
court
had
ruled
and
when
this
court
had
ruled
within
about
two
weeks
we
were
in
before
judge
locke.
so,
why
the
reason
for
not
going
in,
in
1967
is
that
a
federal
district
court
with
that
question
remaining
as
an
open
question
would
be
reluctant
to
enjoin
not
because
it
couldn't,
not
because
it
didn't
interfere
but
because
that
just
would
not
--
you
never
get
somebody
to
do
it
is
really
what's
involved,
but
once
its
clear
that
that
interferes
it's
not
a
question
of
trying
a
res
judicata
defense,
it's
not
a
question
of
under
the
statute,
it
is
not
question
of
any
of
those
things.
it's
simply
a
question
that
the
state
court
action
fetters
the
federal
court
in
making
its
determination
or
it
is
contrary
or
in
some
--
it
does
not
really
even
need
to
be
contrary
as
long
as
it's
necessary
to
some
reason
or
to
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
take
action
and
here,
that
is
really
very
clear.
now,
it
is
said
by
mr.
lyons
that
richman
brothers
ends
the
matter
and
that
richman
brothers
says
that
there
is
a
forbidden
fruit
here
that
you
can't
try
a
preemption
court
--
a
defense
in
the
federal
district
court,
that
you
got
to
let
that
go
on
up.
well,
that
isn't
what
richman
brothers
says.
in
richman
brothers,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court.
that
jurisdiction
had
been
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
anywhere
around.
so,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
aid
and
no
order
should
have
been
entered.
so,
2283
could
not
apply.
it
really
is
just
about
as
simple
as
that.
now,
the
language
--
mr.
allan
milledge
no.
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
“the
should”
area
is
justice
frankfurter
again
writing
the
author
of
toucey
and
he
writes
a
lots
of
reasons
why
it
shouldn't
be
done.
but
fundamentally,
it
all
does
come
back
down
to
the
question
of
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
aid
or
a
judgment
or
order
to
be
protected.
now,
professor
moore
has
something
to
say
about
this.
professor
moore
says
the
--
and
this
is
on
page
43
of
our
brief,
“the
second
exception
permits
a
federal
court
to
grant
an
injunction
against
state
proceedings
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.”
this
puts
back
into
2283
some
of
the
judicial
flexibility
which
toucey
had
removed
from
the
statute.
and
despite
the
strict
reading
of
2283
by
richman
brothers,
flexibility
still
remains
for
richmond
as
we
shall
see
held
only
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
aid.
but
if
on
the
other
hand
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction,
then
under
the
terms
of
2283,
it
may
enjoin
state
court
proceedings
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
now,
since
that
time
there
has
been
the
galveston
wharves
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
possible
that
it
is
very
round
decision
is
since
that
time
as
well
which
--
but
perhaps
not.
the
galveston
wharves
decision
was
a
case
like
the
fec
in
this
regard
that
it
had
been
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
three
times.
it
is
--
it
was
a
case
that
had
spawned
considerable
litigation.
the
state
court
had
enjoined
picketing,
the
federal
court
had
mandated
that
the
carrier
engage
in
good
faith
bargaining.
the
federal
court
enjoined
the
state
court
from
enjoining
the
picketing
because
of
the
impact
that
that
would
have
regardless
of
considerations
of
secondary
conduct
and
galveston
again
was
a
decision
before
this
court's
decision
in
jacksonville
terminal
and
that
case
is
essentially
in
terms
of
the
power
under
2283,
essentially
the
same
case
as
this
one.
the
sperry
rand
case
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
in
that
case
an
injunction
was
issued
against
the
state
court
to
protect
a
discovery
order
of
the
federal
court.
in
the
brown
versus
pacific
mutual
case,
which
is
a
case
which
goes
back
prior
to
the
1948
amendments,
justice
parker
issued
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
or
rather
he
affirmed
an
injunction
against
a
state
court
in
a
case
which
only
involved
cancellation
of
an
insurance
policy.
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
was
for
cancellation,
the
suit
in
the
state
court
was
on
a
$450.00
claim
arising
under
the
policy
and
he
discusses
at
great
length
and
this
is
back
when
there
were
no
exceptions
to
2283.
he
discusses
the
kline
case
which
is
a
case
kline,
and
toucey,
and
richmond
are
really
the
cases
most
often
talked
about,
but
when
you
come
through
all
of
it
and
that
injunction
was
sustained,
but
it
never
reached
this
court,
but
when
you
come
down
really
to
all
of
it,
certainly
the
looney
case
is
still
the
law.
the
looney
case
does
not
fit
into
any
body's
pigeon
hole.
the
looney
case
is
simply
a
case
in
aid
of
jurisdiction.
this
is
what
the
respondents
say
about
looney
and
the
sperry
rand
case.
what
they
teach
is
that
an
interlocutory
order
of
a
federal
court
is
as
much
entitle
to
protection
by
injunction
against
interference
from
a
state
court
as
a
final
order.
that's
certainly
true
under
looney.
looney
--
the
principles
of
looney
were
certainly
carried
forward
and
probably
broadened
in
the,
but
at
least
carried
forward
in
the
48
revision,
and
that
is
certainly
within
the
language
of
2283.
now,
the
reason
that
this
case
is
the
strongest
case
that
of
any
case
for
the
application
of
2283
is
this.
there
are
at
least
0
or
40
separate
cases
the
district
court
has
had,
innumerable
cases
involving
this.
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
opinions
that,
i
don't
think
you
can
number
on
two
hands.
all
of
these
matters
ultimately
come
down
to
one
thing
that
the
florida
east
coast
strike
will
be
settled
only
if
there
is
bargaining,
when
you
finally
come
down
to
it.
now,
there
has
been
no
economic
power,
no
economic
sanction
that
could
be
put
to
bear
upon
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
since
the
first
two
years
of
the
strike,
except
the
economic
sanction
of
asking
the
employees
of
the
neutral
railroads
not
deliver
cars
to
the
fec.
now
in
a
situation
like
this
and
what,
the
reason
really
i
think
that
the
economic
sanctions
initially
didn't
bring
any
kind
of
settlement,
was
because
the
fec
immediately
started
all
these
illegal
operations
for
which
there
is
a
proceedings
now
about
restoration
of
the
status
quo
and
so
forth,
but
they
effectively
through
illegal
conduct
wanted
that,
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
atlantic
coastline.
but
also
from
the
very
beginning,
the
other
form
of
primary
activity
and
surely
there
must
some
way
in
the
railroad
industry
that
you
are
entitled
to
ask
the
people
who
make
pick
ups
and
deliveries
in
the
terms
of
the
steelworker
case
or
in
the
terms
of
this
court
last
year
not
to
do
that
and
of
course,
one
knows
that
in
this
industry
that
they
won't
do
it
if
you
ask
them
not
to.
so,
there
is
an
economic
power
that
has
never
been
used.
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
decided
that
state
courts
have
no
business
in
this
field.
that
interferes
with
not
only
the
federal
scheme,
but
that
interferes
and
with
jurisdiction
assumed
over
the
bargaining,
over
the
self
help
rights
of
the
railroad
and
over
the
question
not
only
of
interchange
between
the
carriers,
but
interchange
as
it
affects
the
rights
of
this
people
and
it
is
all
one
ball
of
wax.
but
if
for
instance,
let
us
assumed
that
a
state
court
tells
the
federal
court
that
the
railroad
cannot
deviate
one
iota
from
its
contract
and
we
know
that
judge
simpson
who
is
originally
the
district
judge
following
the
mandate
of
this
court,
allowed
the
railroad
to
get
away
in
its
operations
from
certain
matters,
i
forget
exactly
what
they
were
to
long,
but
some
matters
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
there
wouldn't
be
any
hesitation,
i
dare
say,
that
that
injunction
by
a
state
court
would
come
within
2283
and
be
stopped.
and
this
is
simply
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
the
only
reason
it
looks
any
different
in
perspective
is
because
the
order
says,
“okay,
do
it.”
or
at
least,
“i'm
not
going
to
give
relief
against
it”
and
so
you
can
say,
well
that
isn't
some
kind
of
an
affirmative
duty,
but
it
bears
on
it
--
the
court
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
legality
of
this
conduct
and
as
a
state
court
order
that
impinges
upon
that
and
it
isn't
tangential
at
all,
it's
the
heart
of
the
whole
business
and
no
bargaining
will
ever
make
any
sense
until
the
day
that
there
is
some
economic
power
on
the
part
of
the
organizations.
i
mean,
the
basic
dispute
still
pends
it's
over
10
cents
an
hour.
a
demand
made
in
1961
and
for
10
cents
an
hour
the
hold
up
strike
can
be
settled
for
10
cents
an
hours
in
an
economy
that
from
1961
to
1969
has
expanded
25
--
on
inflation
25%.
i
mean,
so
something
is
wrong
in
this
strike
and
it
is
that
this
traditional
weapon
of
labor,
primary
picketing
against
people
who
make
deliveries
and
pick
ups
has
never
been
able
to
be
applied.
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
i
think
that
in
the
totality
of
this
situation
that
with
the
perspective
in
the
first
place.
the
perspective
of
the
statute
is
not
litigant's
contentions
or
anything
else.
the
perspective
of
the
statute
is
the
power
of
the
court
and
it's
whether
the
power
of
the
court
depends
on
whether
it
is
assumed
jurisdiction
and
it
has
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
bargaining
orders
which
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well
--
mr.
allan
milledge
well,
the
capital
service
case,
this
case,
if
that
were
so
if
there
was
no
prior
litigation
at
all,
i
believe
that
is
your
assumption
of
no
litigation
at
all,
you
would
then
have
a
situation
which
is
like
the
capital
service
case.
the
difference
would
be
in
capital
service,
it
is
the
board
that
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
then
in
the
capital
service,
the
court
unfettered
itself
first.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
it
is
private
litigants
who
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
a
determination
under
the
railway
labor
act.
and
if
capital
service
is
analogized
to
the
railway
labor
act,
then
an
initial
proceeding
brought
by
a
private
litigant
to
have
the
federal
court
determine
a
question
of
railway
labor
act
law
would
be
entitled,
once
the
court
had
assumed
jurisdiction
to
do
that
would
be
within
2283.
now,
that
doesn't
make
a
stronger
case
for
the
“should
aspect”
as
we
have
in
this
case
because
of
the
totality
of
all
of
the
different
factors.
now,
it
has
been
said
several
times
all
we
need
to
do
is
just
go
ahead
and
follow
our
appellate
remedies
and
it
is
true
the
appellate
remedies
are
there
and
we
can
take
an
appeal
and
we'll
get
back
around
here.
mr.
allan
milledge
oh,
yes
we
can.
well,
if
judge
locke
would
do
what
he
said
he
would
his
letter
and
enter
a
final
judgment,
we
could
appeal
from
that,
that's
quite
true.
that
is
true
in
every
2283
case
and
that
doesn't
affect
the
policy
of
2283,
and
that
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
way
to
deal
with
a
labor
dispute.
if
a
federal
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
and
had
orders,
then
we'll
be
back
here
two
years
from
now
so
that
this
court
can
say
that
jacksonville
terminal,
when
it
says
that
state
law
can
apply,
means
act,
and
then
when
some
state
judge
wants
to
take
jurisdiction
over
something
again,
well,
we'd
be
back
in
another
two
years
after
that
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
the
federal
interest
in
the
settlement
of
the
florida
east
coast
strike
is
enormous.
the
federal
government
has
been
in
the
case
since
the
beginning
not
the
one
with
this
case
number
on
it.
it
does
affect
whole
regions
and
to
have
that
procedure
and
that's
really
what
the
decision
i
think
that
this
court
comes
down
to,
really
the
question
that
is,
is
this
the
type
of
a
case,
like
a
money
judgment
case
in
a
--
it's
already
been
determined
that
toucey
was
wrong
that
fully
litigated
diversity,
but
personal
money
judgment
case
that
you
could
and
should
enjoin
a
state
court.
congress
said
that,
congress
was
upset
to
think
that
you
couldn't
do
that.
now
--
mr.
allan
milledge
but
this
case
if
that's
so,
then
this
case
is
just
overwhelming
for
that
in
--
i
didn't
discuss
the
norris-laguardia
act
at
all,
but
our
position
is
stated
in
the
brief.
