justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
we
have
to
show
with
this
injunction
itself
is
not
covered
by
norris-laguardia?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
application,
the
railroad's
application
for
an
injunction
that
was
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
the
case
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
case
in
which
this
current
order
has
been
entered?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
you
would
making
somewhat
the
same
argument
if
this
case
wasn't
a
railroad
labor
case,
but
was
a
under
the
nlrb,
nlra
regime,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
the
state
court
purports
--
reports
to
enjoin
a
union
from
doing
something
that
is
either
arguably
or
actually
protected
or
prohibited
by
the
labor
act
and
at
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
it
and
the
--
but
the
state
court
nevertheless
purports
to
deal
with
it
by
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
that
the
employer
or
that
the
union
may
not
resort
to
the
federal
court
for
an
injunction
to
prohibit
the
state
courts
from
doing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
or
would
--
it
would
be
said
to
have
no
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
it,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that,
you'd
have
some
problem
with
the
state
court
enjoining
a
violent
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
federal
court
didn't
take
over
the
entire
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not
the
exception
for
secondary
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
preempted
of
the
--
it
is
not
preempted
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
federal
court
either.
what
can
the
federal
court
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
jurisdiction
does
a
federal
court
have
about
that
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
federal
court
is
preempted
too,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
it
if
is
acting
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
court
--
was
the
federal
court
dealing
on
a
state
law
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
purport
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
diversity
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
jurisdiction
would
this
federal
court
have
had
to
deal
with
the
state
law
of
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
that
in
1967,
the
district
court
in
effect
declared
that
this
is
protected
conduct
to
free
from
interference
by
any
court
under
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
that
the
railroad
going
into
the
state
court
is
maybe
enjoined
because
of
its
acting
contrary
to
the
--
at
least
the
declaratory
judgment
that
was
entered
against
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
understand
you
sometime
back
and
say
that
after
1967
injunction
suit
by
the
railroad
in
the
federal
district
court
that
you
might
have
some
problems
here
if
you
had
to
start
a
new
suit
to
enjoin
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
have
some
problem
with
richman
brothers
at
least,
if
there
had
not
been
any
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
at
all
and
that
the
employer
went
right
to
the
state
court
got
an
injunction
and
then
you
started
action
in
the
federal
court?
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
you
awhile
ago
i
think
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
answer
was
you
might
have
the
answer
to
the
problems
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lyons,
let
me
ask
you,
if
this
--
if
in
1967,
the
federal
court
had
said
expressly
or
in
effect
that
this
issue
before
me
is
governed
exclusively
by
federal
law
and
if
the
railroad
has
no
right
to
an
injunction
under
federal
law.
now
and
then,
the
railroad
promptly
resorted
to
state
courts
and
asked
the
state
court
to
adjudicate
the
controversy
under
state
law
and
asked
for
an
injunction
under
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
can
say
federal
law
preempts
at
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
we
have
to
show
with
this
injunction
itself
is
not
covered
by
norris-laguardia?

what

of

what

about

so,
what

does
a

have
about
that
--?
justice

federal

is
preempted

isn't

why

why
does
it
if
