mr.

you

you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
before
you
do
mr.
clark,
may
i
just
remind
you
and
i
don't
want
you
inhibit
you
about
reading
it
that
you're
not
going
to
ask
us
to
decide
whether
the
material
should've
justified
the
verdict,
i
take
it
but
rather
your
obligation
here
is
to
point
out
what
error
there
was
in
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
is
that
primarily
it?
chief

warren
e.

in

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
read
as
a
whole,
the
articles
say
in
effect
that
bresler
was
engaging
in
high
pressure
tactics
to
force
the
city
to
do
something
he
wanted
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
specifically
which
information
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
is
it
your
position
that
even
if
the
instructions
were
correct
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
observed
that
you've
only
got
two
minutes
left
of
today.
i
think
we
won't
ask
you
to
split
your
argument
to
such
a
fragment
so
we'll
adjourn
for
the
day.

mr.
chasanow,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
would
that
make,
mr.
chasanow
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
if
he
is
a
public
official?
must
they
identify
him
each
time
by
his
office
in
order
to
bring
themselves
under
the
times
and
sullivan
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
had
said
in
the
article
builder
and
prominent
political
figure
or
builder
and
political
leader,
would
then
--
you'd
have
no
objection
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
did,
if
they
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
making
a
point
of
their
omission
of
his
political
affiliations.
if
they
said
builder
and
political
figure,
builder
and
political
leader,
builder
and
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
or
whatever
he
is
called
there,
would
that
make
it
alright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
the
governor
for
example
coming
to
the
end
of
a
session
of
legislature
announces
publicly,
a
speech
or
something
that
if
the
legislature
doesn't
do
certain
things,
he's
going
to
call
him
back
in
a
special
session.
then
some
member
of
the
legislature
makes
some
statement
to
the
press
that
the
governor
is
engaging
in
blackmail
against

do
you
think
that's
libelous
per
se?
chief

thank
you,
mr.
chasanow.
mr.
clark,
you
have
nine
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
point
that
this
was
a
group
libel
in
effect
by
addressing
the
term
skullduggery
to
the
conduct
of
the
entire
board,
not
any
one
person?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
before
you
[voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
could
show
falsity
you'd
enough
to
have
a
pretty
firm
definition
of
what
skullduggery
is
wouldn't
you,
that
would
be
hard
to
come
by
perhaps?
chief
