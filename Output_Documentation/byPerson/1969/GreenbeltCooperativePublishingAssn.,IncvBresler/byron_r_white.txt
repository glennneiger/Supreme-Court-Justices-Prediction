justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
trial
court
refer
to
in
instructions
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah!
but
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
and
in
its
instruction
to
the
jury
as
far
as
any
particular
document
is
concerned,
it
only
referred
to
the
blackmail
article?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
general
walker
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
what
was
that?
the
court
if
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
arguing
here
--
you're
arguing
here
then
that
even
if
these
instructions
don't
pass
muster
under
new
york
times
or
even
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
prove
malice
under
new
york
times
that
you're
nevertheless
home
free
on
a
non-new
york
times
basis
because
this
isn't
a
new
york
times
case,
is
that
your
position
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
asserting
here
that
--
you
don't
concede
here
then
i
take
it
that
this
isn't
--
that
this
gentleman
was
a
--
was
either
a
public
figure
or
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
do
you
concede
that
the
new
york
times
rules
apply
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
only
one
case,
one
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
skullduggery
and
blackmail?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
say
that
new
york
times
has
no
relevance
to
this
case
here?
there's
no
applicability
to
this
case,
they
don't
--
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
that,
that
those
statements
about
this
gentleman,
you're
saying
that
he
just
isn't
a
--
either
a
public
figure
or
a
public
official.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
how
can
you
tell
us
now
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
application
of
new
york
times
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
now
though
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
like
to
now
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
you
say
he
is
a
public
figure
in
greenbelt
and
he
wasn't
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
what
respect
was
he
a
public
figure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
that
these
are
--
some
of
these
allegations
are
certainly
related
to
whatever
it
was
that
made
him
a
public
figure,
namely
his
activities
in
the
construction
business
and
his
relationships
with
the
county
board.
that's
what
made
him
a
public
figure.
weren't
these
allegations
relate
to
his
--
the
conduct
of
his
business
with
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no,
no.
conceding
that
the
allegations
were
false,
doesn't
concede
any
knowledge
of
the
falsity
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
conceded
that
if
they
were
given
the
meaning
of
charging
a
crime
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judge
also
in
defining
libel,
however,
if
the
jury
thought
that
--
it
was
left
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
charge
you
with
blackmail
the
way
it
was
used,
was
the
charge
deferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
jury
could
not
sign
for
the
plaintiff
unless
they
believe
that
the
way
blackmail
was
used
was
meant
to
charge
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
we
had
to
believe
that
before
they
could
find
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
these
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
if
they
have
--
if
--
let's
assume
that
the
judge
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
words
charged
a
crime,
you
disagree
with
that
but
let's
assume
that
he
ruled
that
way.
but
then
he
asked
if
you
concede
that
the
so
construed,
those
words
were
false,
you
would
concede
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
court
did
end
up
saying
that
you
can
only
find
for
the
plaintiff
if
you
find
knowing
falsity
or
reckless
disregard,
you
can
only
find
for
the
plaintiff
if
you
find
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
ended
up
by
saying
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
find
hostility.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
skullduggery
is
a
libelous
word?
now
let's
just
assume
why
if
that
--
you
say
that
so
and
so
is
guilty
of
skullduggery?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
is
it
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice
overlap]
free,
a
newspaper
is
completely
free
to
charge
anybody
it
wants
to,
private
citizen
or
not
with
skullduggery?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
not
the
kind
[voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
is
--
wouldn't
make
it
as
far
as
being
libelous
is
concerned?
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
private
citizen
or
public
figure
as
to
whether
or
not
it
satisfies
the
definition
of
libel?
