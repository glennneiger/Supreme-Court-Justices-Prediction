mr.
abraham
chasanow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
contend
that
the
evidence
is
constitutionally
insufficient
to
support
the
judgment
and
as
a
basis
for
that
contention,
they
refer
to
three
of
the
45
exhibits
which
were
introduced
by
the
respondent
which
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
it
was
to
consider
and
which
it
did
in
fact
consider.
now,
some
of
those
exhibits
are
contained
in
the
printed
record,
others
which
are
not
as
important
as
the
major
exhibits
are
in
the
transcript.
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
the
publications
that
mr.
bresler
had
committed
blackmail,
there
were
publications
that
he
had
engaged
in
an
unethical
trade,
had
been
guilty
of
skullduggery,
had
had
legal
proceedings
started
against
him
for
failure
to
make
construction,
corrections
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
these
allegations
were
injurious
to
mr.
bresler
and
his
business
as
a
contractor
and
were
libelous
per
se.
the
court
had
also
previously
referred
in
its
opinion
to
another
article
which
was
published
prior
to
the
three
foregoing
articles.
on
april
22,
1965,
before
the
blackmail
articles
and
before
mr.
bresler
became
a
candidate
for
comptroller
and
that
was
headlined,
city
battles
bresler
on
two
fronts.
there
was
a
sub
caption
court
suit,
it
was
written
by
petitioner
skolnick
and
it
falsely
alleged
that
the
city
and
bresler
will
also
be
at
odds
this
week
when
the
suit
filed
by
the
city
against
ivy
homes,
inc.
and
boxwood
village
inc.
comes
before
the
circuit
court.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
this
was
the
principle
charge
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
second
blackmail
article
for
example,
there
was
the
word
skullduggery
and
when
the
--
mr.
skolnick
was
asked
on
the
stand
about
the
word
skullduggery,
he
said,
this
is
the
word
that
the
reporter
used
in
the
article.
when
the
reporter
testified
for
the
petitioners,
she
said,
i
did
not
use
that
word,
that
was
inserted
and
as
frequently
happens.
now
this
was
a
change
and
this
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
was
intended
to
impute
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
bresler.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
trial
court
specifically
said
of
course
that
the
jury
should
consider
all
of
the
articles
in
evidence
and
also
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
to
consider
the
entire
context.
now,
i
emphasize
that
because
one
of
their
principle
arguments
says
that
the
word
blackmail
was
taken
out
of
context
and
it
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
well,
first,
they
had
taken
it
out
of
context
but
publishing
it
as
a
caption
in
the
first
article.
secondly,
the
reporters
both
said
that
they
had
not
published
all
of
their
notes
concerning
the
meeting
but
that
they
had
used
the
word
blackmail.
the
second
reporter,
the
reporter
who
wrote
the
second
article
said,
i
selected
out
the
word
blackmail
to
show
it
was
mr.
herling's
word.
but
she
said,
i
didn't
use
all
my
notes
and
when
i
asked
her
why
she
selected
out
the
word,
she
said,
well,
it
had
been
used,
the
word
the
week
before
and
i
felt
it
was
proper
to
use
it
again
in
the
article.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
one
other
important
point
and
that
is
that
these
people
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
oh!
yes.
the
second
blackmail
article,
exhibit
2
in
the
record.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
referred
to
the
blackmail
article
--
well,
actually
the
court
said,
it
was
not
going
to
comment
particularly
on
the
facts
but
just
briefly
said
what
the
--
what
some
of
the
witnesses
said,
but
it
didn't
go
into
detail
on
the
facts
itself.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
specific
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
made
one
other
point
which
is
important
to
this
issue.
to
distinguish
it
from
other
articles,
which
are
published
by
a
newspaper
in
which
intemperate
statements
are
made.
it
said
that
there
--
this
was
not
a
disinterested
or
impartial
publishing
of
a
report
of
what
was
said
at
a
public
meeting
and
it
pointed
out
that
the
people
who
had
made
the
statement,
there
was
a
relationship
between
them.
the
court
said
specifically
--
i'm
sorry.
oh!
yes.
the
court
repealed
--
referred
and
i
quote,
“the
close
connection
between
the
skolnicks,
mrs.
bergemann,
mrs.
rosetti
and
mr.
herling,
those
to
whom
the
word
blackmail
was
attributed,
mrs.
sucher
and
mrs.
williamson
who
wrote
the
articles
and
charles
schwan,
the
president
of
ghi
and
the
principal
opponent
of
bresler
on
the
high
school
and
zoning
issues.
now,
i
think
it
might
be,
well,
at
this
point
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
did
concede
that,
your
honor,
i
mean
for
a
purpose
to
void
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
arguendo.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
may
i
make
an
exception
to
that,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
question
to
public
official
which
would
--
has
never
been
clearly
defined
is
an
important
issue
in
this
case
in
this
respect
that
their
only
constitutional
defense
was
that
bresler
was
a
public
official.
the
evidence
showed
that
at
the
time
of
the
first
two
series
of
articles,
bresler
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
montgomery
county,
a
different
county,
not
prince
george's
county.
there
is
no
mention
in
any
of
the
45
exhibits
that
bresler
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
and
none
of
the
articles
pertained
in
any
way
to
his
official
conduct
which
is
emphasized
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
now
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
i
say
this
because
normally,
reference
is
made
to
official
conduct
which
has
to
identify
the
official.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
official
conduct
and
they
didn't
even
think
that
they
were
--
there
was
any
privilege
attached
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
public
official
because
they
didn't
mention
it.
even
the
article
was
a
published
fact
that
it
was
going
to
be
announced
that
he
was
to
run
for
state
comptroller,
that
governor,
later
vice
president
agnew
had
asked
him
to
run.
in
that
article,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
we
say
they
are
using
this
just
as
a
cloak
in
order
to
say
he
was
fair
game
because
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
specific
instruction
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
if
your
honor
will
draw
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
brennan,
between
the
sullivan
case
and
i'd
like
to
point
that
in
my
brief,
i
have
indicated
there
are
numerous
exceptions.
one
i'd
like
to
mention
particularly,
in
mr.
justice
black's
dissenting
opinion,
in
the
butts
case,
he
referred
--
i'm
sorry,
new
york
times
rather,
concurring
opinion
--
a
separate
concurring
opinion,
he
referred
to
new
york
times
as
an
outside
agitator.
in
the
posture
of
the
case,
here
was
the
new
york
times
facing
a
hostile
and
prejudiced
community
which
--
in
which
they
could
hardly
hope
for
a
fair
trial.
the
respondent
in
that
case,
commissioner
sullivan
was
a
resident
of
montgomery
county,
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
composed
of
residents
of
montgomery
county.
he
was
attacking
this
foreign
newspaper
which
was
coming
in
and
trying
to
tell
them
what
to
do.
we
have
actually
the
inverse
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
bresler
was
the
foreigner,
he
was
the
outsider.
he
was
coming
into
greenbelt.
now,
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
proper
perspective,
i'd
like
to
mention
one
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
noted.
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
skolnick
was
a
member
of
this
organization
identified
as
ghi
greenbelt
homes
which
had
once
owned
the
land
in
controversy
plus
some
300
acres
more.
the
federal
government
had
sold
that
land
together
with
the
house
in
greenbelt
to
this
corporation
and
said,
“we
want
you
to
control
the
development
around
it.
so
we're
selling
you
this
land
at
a
low
price.”
instead
of
developing
it,
they
took
a
quick
profit,
they
sold
it.
then
they
realized
that
they
might
have
made
a
mistake
that
somebody
else
was
making
the
profits
that
they
might
have
made
and
then
stepping
in
the
first
blackmail
article,
one
of
the
councilmen
said,
and
he
was
a
member
of
ghi,
how
much
profit
is
he
going
to
make?
this
was
a
burning
question.
the
other
was
that
mr.
bresler
and
his
associate
had
plans
which
were
interfering
with
their
own
plans,
for
example
on
this
matter
of
the
townhouses.
parcels
one
and
two
were
adjacent
to
greenbelt
homes
property.
they
were
fighting,
the
townhouses
on
that
--
those
parcels
because
the
fact,
they
were
going
to
build
their
own
townhouse.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
built
there
as
in
bresler
hasn't
built
a
single
townhouse
on
parcel
one
and
two.
then
also,
they
were
going
to
tell
the
school
board
where
to
put
the
school.
now,
the
school
board
planned
a
high
school
and
two
other
schools
and
they
said,
we
don't
want
the
high
school
next
door.
we
want
you
to
build
a
high
school
on
parcel
15
which
was
remote
and
much
more
expensive
which
was
next
to
the
beltway
which
was
undesirable
for
a
number
of
reasons
and
even
filed
suit
against
the
school
board
to
prevent
them
from
building
the
school
on
parcels
one
and
two.
they
were
also
saying
to
the
park
and
planning
commission
which
was
the
official
professional
planning
organization
for
the
entire
county,
we
don't
want
you
to
zone
this
property
for
townhouses.
now,
they
were
trying
to
dictate
even
though
they
had
once
owned
and
controlled
this
property,
they
were
trying
to
dictate
how
this
property
was
going
to
be
developed
and
this
is
a
conflict.
these
were
amateur
planners
who
were
trying
to
tell
the
professionals
what
to
do.
i
think
that
in
order
to
recognize
the
posture
of
this
case,
let
me
jump
to
the
articles
which
start
with
the
announcement
that
mr.
bresler
was
going
to
run
for
comptroller.
i
had
not
realized
until
recently
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well
this
--
well,
let
me
say
this,
we
had
felt
that
actually
butts
was
a
dominating
case
because
we
felt
that
he
was
not
really
a
public
official
at
least
as
it
had
been
previously
defined
in
other
cases
by
this
court.
he
didn't
come
within
any
categories
of
st.
amant
or
a
commissioner
as
in
new
york
times
or
deputy
sheriff
or
any
of
the
other
categories
and
this
court
has
specifically
said
that
we're
not
saying
how
far
we're
going
to
go
and
we
certainly
won't
go
all
the
way
down
the
line.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
as
a
public
figure?
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
general
walker
was
a
nationally
known
figure,
no
question
of
this.
the
court
of
appeals,
they
couldn't
comment
it,
that
they
would
not
have
found
bresler
to
be
a
public
figure.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
this
clear.
we
did
not
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
would
not
have
found
bresler
to
be
either
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure
but
they
said
arguendo
since
the
trial
court
had
instructed
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
both
public
official
and
public
figure
that
the
question
is
really
academic.
but,
mr.
bresler
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
think
that
would
be
one
aspect
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
are
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
that's
a
question
i
asked.
now,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
he
was
a
public
figure
in
greenbelt
because
the
newspaper
made
him
one.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
to
this
entire
case
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
but
i'm
saying
that
there
are
some
of
these
libels
which
had
no
application
whatsoever
to
as
--
his
activities
as
a
public
figure.
for
example,
the
accusations
that
there
had
been
suits
filed
against
him
for
violation
of
county
building
standards.
this
had
nothing
--
this
was
a
private
enterprise,
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
issue
with
--
which
they
were
emphasizing
land
and
zoning
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
carrying
the
public
figure
concept
too
far.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
again,
we
don't
think
that
those
would
apply.
we
think
that
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
don't
think
new
york
times
does
apply.
i
think
that
if
there's
any
application
it
might
be
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir
because
we
wanted
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
was
in
effect
assuming
arguendo
because
i
wanted
the
instructions
of
the
jury
to
be
as
broad
as
possible.
i
did
not
want
any
decision
to
rest
on
any
narrow
definition
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
what's
it?
mr.
abraham
chasanow
only
insofar
as
this
court
itself
has
narrowed.
for
example,
in
new
york
times,
the
court
said
about
eight
times
that
this
referred
to
the
official
conduct
of
a
public
official.
then
--
there's
nothing
to
do
with
the
official
conduct
of
mr.
bresler.
so
we
say
if
new
york
times
applies,
then
perhaps,
it's
just
as
goldberg's
statement
which
says
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
private
activities
of
a
public
official.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
sir,
we
couldn't,
we
couldn't
deny
it.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
fact
that
they
had
made
him
one,
as
one
who
was
participating
--
well,
i'd
have
to
go
back
to
1934
--
i
mean,
60
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
i
think
i
could
point
out
more
clearly
what
made
him
a
public
figure.
in
1964
on
may
7
when
there
was
some
dispute,
some
discussion
of
the
council,
the
news
review
published
a
report
that
the
council
and
the
audience
decided
it
made
much
more
sense
to
it,
stop
attacking
each
other
and
concentrate
on
a
common
target,
bresler
who
wasn't
there
and
that
was
when
they
decided
that
they
had
to
have
a
scapegoat
because
bresler
only
owned
a
minority
interest
in
these
properties.
he
was
not
the
major
owner.
there
were
others
who
owned
more
of
an
interest
than
he,
but
they
had
to
have
a
name
and
his
was
a
name
that
was
selected.
they
were
--
this
was
followed
up
by
the
group
sponsored
by
greenbelt
homes.
mr.
schwan
who
was
president,
in
which
they
announced
on
april,
8,
1965
that
the
saved
greenbelt
group
gets
its
officers
a
name
cfpg
and
they
formed
this
organization
with
mr.
schwan
with
mayor
smith
with
albert
herling
who
made
one
of
the
blackmail
accusations
with
mrs.
skolnick
and
then
on
april,
22,
they
announced
not
only
a
citizenship
assistant
wide
--
a
citywide
membership
drive
but
had
an
article,
city
battles
bresler
on
two
fronts.
he
was
singled
out
by
the
news
review
and
that
was
when
they
made
the
false
allegation
with
the
subtitle
court
suit
that
the
city
and
bresler
will
be
at
odds.
now,
bresler
was
not
a
defendant
in
that
case
and
they
knew
it.
even
later,
on
may,
6,
after
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
after
the
court
had
issued
an
order
against
ivy
homes,
inc.
in
which
bresler
had
no
interest
whatsoever,
this
was
what
the
news
review
said,
“at
a
hearing
held
two
weeks
ago,
a
court
order
was
issued
to
the
builders
of
boxwood,
another
bresler
development.”
bresler
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
development
to
which
the
court
urged,
but
they
wanted
to
feature
his
name.
the
exhibit
showed
that
they
constantly
featured
his
name.
this
is
like
the
man
who
pleaded
for
leniency
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
orphan
after
he
had
shot
his
parents.
they
had
made
him
a
public
figure
and
they
were
using
this.
they
were
using
the
public
official
defense
even
though
they
knew
that
there
was
no
relation
and
there
was
no
mention
in
the
articles.
but
getting
through
the
time
when
they
announced
charles
bresler
to
run
for
state
comptroller
on
june,
9,
1966,
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
the
question
of
malice.
now,
they
point
out
that
this
lawsuit
that
was
filed
about
mr.
bresler
was
subsequent,
it
had
nothing
to
do.
but
taking
the
chronology
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
this
was
after
the
blackmail
charge.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
after
the
blackmail
charge,
there
were
other
defamations.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
consider
that
the
blackmail,
skullduggery,
false
reports
of
lawsuits
for
violation
of
building
standards
which
damaged
him
as
a
builder,
those
were
probably
the
most
serious.
there
were
other
articles
about
possible
corrupt
influence
on
the
school
board
in
which
his
name
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
suit
against
the
school
board.
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
but
they
mentioned
--
they
featured
his
name.
it's
hard
to
say
which
draw
broke
the
camel's
back
but
we
thought
there
was
an
accumulation
which
certainly
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
certainly
made
him
the
most
hated
man
in
greenbelt.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
dispute
about
that
and
we
think
that
the
accumulative
effect
of
these
articles,
even
those
which
were
not
necessarily
libelous
per
se,
which
were
intended
to
and
did
in
fact
damage
him,
but
describe
it
to
indicate
the
process.
they
announced
he
was
going
to
run
for
state
comptroller
on
june
9
and
that's
when
they
have
the
article
which
had
several
false
statements
and
this
time,
in
that
article,
he
was
identified
as
a
builder.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
as
a
builder.
not
to
mentioned
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates,
but
as
a
developer
and
builder.
it
said
he
is
currently
faced
with
a
series
of
legal
actions
instituted
by
the
city
of
greenbelt
and
referred
to
this
suit
which
had
been
dismissed
almost
a
year
before
and
then
also
that
false
report
that
a
number
of
homeowners
in
lake
crescent
parks
with
developed
and
started
legal
proceedings
against
him.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
it
did.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
oh,
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
not
--
would
not
be
the
governing
factor
but
i
think
it
would
at
least
if
they
were
saying
we
have
the
right
to
criticize
a
candidate
for
office,
there
certainly
might
be
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
does
hold
the
political
office.
if
there
was
a
question
he
was
qualified
for
that
office,
may
be
there
should
be
some
question
about
it
but
we
don't
contend
this
is
a
major
premise.
we
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
was
damaging
as
we
alleged
to
his
reputation
as
a
builder,
his
violation
of
county
building
standards
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
public
issue.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
sir,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
though.
there
had
been
articles
published
about
the
time.
there
still
are,
there
was
one
in
this
morning
about
bribe
--
relating
to
bribery
on
zoning
in
prince
george,
this
had
been
a
burning
issue
in
prince
george's
county
and
virginia.
the
people
in
greenbelt
were
very
aware
of
this.
now,
to
them,
the
fact
that
somebody
was
threatening
to
prevent
the
building
of
a
school,
i
would
think
would
be
much
more
serious
than
just
bribing
some
official
with
a
couple
hundred
dollars.
the
jury
obviously
felt
that
they
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mrs.
skolnick
when
asked,
did
you
believe
that
--
or
did
you
intend
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
or
did
you
think
that
the
article
--
that
the
statements
were
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
were
proper,
she
said
yes,
in
the
context
of
the
meeting
they
were
proper.
there
was
no
question
that
they
intended
to
defame
him.
these
were
not
someone
whom
the
news
review
was
reporting,
these
were
their
own
people
making
these
statements
so
the
news
review
could
publish
them
and
it
was
intended
to
inflame
the
people
to
the
point
where
they
felt
he
had
committed
a
crime.
i
certainly
think
that
anyone
who
would
stop
the
building
of
a
school
would
be
verging
on
something
criminal
particularly
when
they
themselves
in
their
brief
mention
coerced
and
threatened.
this
is
what
the
general
public
feels,
this
blackmail,
coercion
and
threats.
i
think
the
whole
posture
of
the
case
that
the
fact
that
at
that
meeting,
they
read
an
inflammatory
statement
to
begin
with
by
mr.
schwan
and
then
the
statements
were
made
indicate
the
whole
purpose
was
to
cause
these
inflammatory
statements
to
be
made
so
they
could
publish
them
and
republish
them
the
following
week
when
mr.
herling
was
a
member
of
that
group,
made
the
blackmail
statement.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
we
did
not
claim
any
pecuniary
loss
because
how
can
we
prove
that
people
would
not
buy
any
of
the
houses
because
he
wasn't
building
according
to
county
standards,
there
is
no
way
of
proving
that
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir,
they
felt
i'm
sure
that
there
had
been
pecuniary
loss
as
well
as
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
i
think
they
were
conditioned
by
the
statements
made
about
this
poor
newspaper.
i
think
that
there
might
have
been
a
lot
greater,
in
fact,
my
discussion
with
a
couple
of
jurors
later
indicated
that
it
could
have
been
a
good
deal
more.
i
think
the
jury
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir,
but
i
think
that
they
tried
to
be
temperate.
i
think
it
indicated
that
they
did
reach
what
they
felt
was
a
verdict
fair
to
both
sides.
we
think
that
this
whole
pattern
and
i'm
sorry
that
the
exhibits
are
not
in
chronological
order
indicated
that
they
were
leading
up
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
filing
of
the
suit
against
mr.
bresler
which
was
an
absolutely
privileged
action
was
followed
shortly
after
the
announcement
of
his
candidacy
and
we
felt
that
this
whole
pattern
of
announcement
week
after
week
with
a
combination
of
a
suit
and
the
misrepresentation
as
to
the
purpose
of
collecting
the
money
for
the
suit
was
an
indication
that
they
had
intended
to
damage
him
all
the
way
through
that
this
was
a
continuing
action.
we
think
that
obviously
the
jury
was
convinced
that
they
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
and
that
is
what
a
layman
reading
the
article
would
have
felt,
particularly
when
there
was
no
reason
to
publish
the
caption
blackmail
unless
they
wanted
to
invite
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
accused
of
blackmail,
that
he
was
a
criminal.
i
thank
you.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
contend
that
the
evidence
is
constitutionally
insufficient
to
support
the
judgment
and
as
a
basis
for
that
contention,
they
refer
to
three
of
the
45
exhibits
which
were
introduced
by
the
respondent
which
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
it
was
to
consider
and
which
it
did
in
fact
consider.
now,
some
of
those
exhibits
are
contained
in
the
printed
record,
others
which
are
not
as
important
as
the
major
exhibits
are
in
the
transcript.
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
the
publications
that
mr.
bresler
had
committed
blackmail,
there
were
publications
that
he
had
engaged
in
an
unethical
trade,
had
been
guilty
of
skullduggery,
had
had
legal
proceedings
started
against
him
for
failure
to
make
construction,
corrections
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
these
allegations
were
injurious
to
mr.
bresler
and
his
business
as
a
contractor
and
were
libelous
per
se.
the
court
had
also
previously
referred
in
its
opinion
to
another
article
which
was
published
prior
to
the
three
foregoing
articles.
on
april
22,
1965,
before
the
blackmail
articles
and
before
mr.
bresler
became
a
candidate
for
comptroller
and
that
was
headlined,
city
battles
bresler
on
two
fronts.
there
was
a
sub
caption
court
suit,
it
was
written
by
petitioner
skolnick
and
it
falsely
alleged
that
the
city
and
bresler
will
also
be
at
odds
this
week
when
the
suit
filed
by
the
city
against
ivy
homes,
inc.
and
boxwood
village
inc.
comes
before
the
circuit
court.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
this
was
the
principle
charge
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
second
blackmail
article
for
example,
there
was
the
word
skullduggery
and
when
the
--
mr.
skolnick
was
asked
on
the
stand
about
the
word
skullduggery,
he
said,
this
is
the
word
that
the
reporter
used
in
the
article.
when
the
reporter
testified
for
the
petitioners,
she
said,
i
did
not
use
that
word,
that
was
inserted
and
as
frequently
happens.
now
this
was
a
change
and
this
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
was
intended
to
impute
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
bresler.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
trial
court
specifically
said
of
course
that
the
jury
should
consider
all
of
the
articles
in
evidence
and
also
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
to
consider
the
entire
context.
now,
i
emphasize
that
because
one
of
their
principle
arguments
says
that
the
word
blackmail
was
taken
out
of
context
and
it
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
well,
first,
they
had
taken
it
out
of
context
but
publishing
it
as
a
caption
in
the
first
article.
secondly,
the
reporters
both
said
that
they
had
not
published
all
of
their
notes
concerning
the
meeting
but
that
they
had
used
the
word
blackmail.
the
second
reporter,
the
reporter
who
wrote
the
second
article
said,
i
selected
out
the
word
blackmail
to
show
it
was
mr.
herling's
word.
but
she
said,
i
didn't
use
all
my
notes
and
when
i
asked
her
why
she
selected
out
the
word,
she
said,
well,
it
had
been
used,
the
word
the
week
before
and
i
felt
it
was
proper
to
use
it
again
in
the
article.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
one
other
important
point
and
that
is
that
these
people
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
oh!
yes.
the
second
blackmail
article,
exhibit
2
in
the
record.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
referred
to
the
blackmail
article
--
well,
actually
the
court
said,
it
was
not
going
to
comment
particularly
on
the
facts
but
just
briefly
said
what
the
--
what
some
of
the
witnesses
said,
but
it
didn't
go
into
detail
on
the
facts
itself.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
specific
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
made
one
other
point
which
is
important
to
this
issue.
to
distinguish
it
from
other
articles,
which
are
published
by
a
newspaper
in
which
intemperate
statements
are
made.
it
said
that
there
--
this
was
not
a
disinterested
or
impartial
publishing
of
a
report
of
what
was
said
at
a
public
meeting
and
it
pointed
out
that
the
people
who
had
made
the
statement,
there
was
a
relationship
between
them.
the
court
said
specifically
--
i'm
sorry.
oh!
yes.
the
court
repealed
--
referred
and
i
quote,
“the
close
connection
between
the
skolnicks,
mrs.
bergemann,
mrs.
rosetti
and
mr.
herling,
those
to
whom
the
word
blackmail
was
attributed,
mrs.
sucher
and
mrs.
williamson
who
wrote
the
articles
and
charles
schwan,
the
president
of
ghi
and
the
principal
opponent
of
bresler
on
the
high
school
and
zoning
issues.
now,
i
think
it
might
be,
well,
at
this
point
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
did
concede
that,
your
honor,
i
mean
for
a
purpose
to
void
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
arguendo.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
may
i
make
an
exception
to
that,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
question
to
public
official
which
would
--
has
never
been
clearly
defined
is
an
important
issue
in
this
case
in
this
respect
that
their
only
constitutional
defense
was
that
bresler
was
a
public
official.
the
evidence
showed
that
at
the
time
of
the
first
two
series
of
articles,
bresler
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
montgomery
county,
a
different
county,
not
prince
george's
county.
there
is
no
mention
in
any
of
the
45
exhibits
that
bresler
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates
and
none
of
the
articles
pertained
in
any
way
to
his
official
conduct
which
is
emphasized
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
now
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
i
say
this
because
normally,
reference
is
made
to
official
conduct
which
has
to
identify
the
official.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
official
conduct
and
they
didn't
even
think
that
they
were
--
there
was
any
privilege
attached
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
public
official
because
they
didn't
mention
it.
even
the
article
was
a
published
fact
that
it
was
going
to
be
announced
that
he
was
to
run
for
state
comptroller,
that
governor,
later
vice
president
agnew
had
asked
him
to
run.
in
that
article,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
we
say
they
are
using
this
just
as
a
cloak
in
order
to
say
he
was
fair
game
because
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
specific
instruction
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
if
your
honor
will
draw
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
brennan,
between
the
sullivan
case
and
i'd
like
to
point
that
in
my
brief,
i
have
indicated
there
are
numerous
exceptions.
one
i'd
like
to
mention
particularly,
in
mr.
justice
black's
dissenting
opinion,
in
the
butts
case,
he
referred
--
i'm
sorry,
new
york
times
rather,
concurring
opinion
--
a
separate
concurring
opinion,
he
referred
to
new
york
times
as
an
outside
agitator.
in
the
posture
of
the
case,
here
was
the
new
york
times
facing
a
hostile
and
prejudiced
community
which
--
in
which
they
could
hardly
hope
for
a
fair
trial.
the
respondent
in
that
case,
commissioner
sullivan
was
a
resident
of
montgomery
county,
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
composed
of
residents
of
montgomery
county.
he
was
attacking
this
foreign
newspaper
which
was
coming
in
and
trying
to
tell
them
what
to
do.
we
have
actually
the
inverse
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
bresler
was
the
foreigner,
he
was
the
outsider.
he
was
coming
into
greenbelt.
now,
in
order
to
put
this
case
in
proper
perspective,
i'd
like
to
mention
one
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
noted.
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
skolnick
was
a
member
of
this
organization
identified
as
ghi
greenbelt
homes
which
had
once
owned
the
land
in
controversy
plus
some
300
acres
more.
the
federal
government
had
sold
that
land
together
with
the
house
in
greenbelt
to
this
corporation
and
said,
“we
want
you
to
control
the
development
around
it.
so
we're
selling
you
this
land
at
a
low
price.”
instead
of
developing
it,
they
took
a
quick
profit,
they
sold
it.
then
they
realized
that
they
might
have
made
a
mistake
that
somebody
else
was
making
the
profits
that
they
might
have
made
and
then
stepping
in
the
first
blackmail
article,
one
of
the
councilmen
said,
and
he
was
a
member
of
ghi,
how
much
profit
is
he
going
to
make?
this
was
a
burning
question.
the
other
was
that
mr.
bresler
and
his
associate
had
plans
which
were
interfering
with
their
own
plans,
for
example
on
this
matter
of
the
townhouses.
parcels
one
and
two
were
adjacent
to
greenbelt
homes
property.
they
were
fighting,
the
townhouses
on
that
--
those
parcels
because
the
fact,
they
were
going
to
build
their
own
townhouse.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
built
there
as
in
bresler
hasn't
built
a
single
townhouse
on
parcel
one
and
two.
then
also,
they
were
going
to
tell
the
school
board
where
to
put
the
school.
now,
the
school
board
planned
a
high
school
and
two
other
schools
and
they
said,
we
don't
want
the
high
school
next
door.
we
want
you
to
build
a
high
school
on
parcel
15
which
was
remote
and
much
more
expensive
which
was
next
to
the
beltway
which
was
undesirable
for
a
number
of
reasons
and
even
filed
suit
against
the
school
board
to
prevent
them
from
building
the
school
on
parcels
one
and
two.
they
were
also
saying
to
the
park
and
planning
commission
which
was
the
official
professional
planning
organization
for
the
entire
county,
we
don't
want
you
to
zone
this
property
for
townhouses.
now,
they
were
trying
to
dictate
even
though
they
had
once
owned
and
controlled
this
property,
they
were
trying
to
dictate
how
this
property
was
going
to
be
developed
and
this
is
a
conflict.
these
were
amateur
planners
who
were
trying
to
tell
the
professionals
what
to
do.
i
think
that
in
order
to
recognize
the
posture
of
this
case,
let
me
jump
to
the
articles
which
start
with
the
announcement
that
mr.
bresler
was
going
to
run
for
comptroller.
i
had
not
realized
until
recently
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well
this
--
well,
let
me
say
this,
we
had
felt
that
actually
butts
was
a
dominating
case
because
we
felt
that
he
was
not
really
a
public
official
at
least
as
it
had
been
previously
defined
in
other
cases
by
this
court.
he
didn't
come
within
any
categories
of
st.
amant
or
a
commissioner
as
in
new
york
times
or
deputy
sheriff
or
any
of
the
other
categories
and
this
court
has
specifically
said
that
we're
not
saying
how
far
we're
going
to
go
and
we
certainly
won't
go
all
the
way
down
the
line.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
as
a
public
figure?
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
general
walker
was
a
nationally
known
figure,
no
question
of
this.
the
court
of
appeals,
they
couldn't
comment
it,
that
they
would
not
have
found
bresler
to
be
a
public
figure.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
this
clear.
we
did
not
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
would
not
have
found
bresler
to
be
either
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure
but
they
said
arguendo
since
the
trial
court
had
instructed
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
both
public
official
and
public
figure
that
the
question
is
really
academic.
but,
mr.
bresler
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
think
that
would
be
one
aspect
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
are
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
that's
a
question
i
asked.
now,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
he
was
a
public
figure
in
greenbelt
because
the
newspaper
made
him
one.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
to
this
entire
case
mr.
justice
white
for
this
reason.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
but
i'm
saying
that
there
are
some
of
these
libels
which
had
no
application
whatsoever
to
as
--
his
activities
as
a
public
figure.
for
example,
the
accusations
that
there
had
been
suits
filed
against
him
for
violation
of
county
building
standards.
this
had
nothing
--
this
was
a
private
enterprise,
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
issue
with
--
which
they
were
emphasizing
land
and
zoning
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
carrying
the
public
figure
concept
too
far.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
again,
we
don't
think
that
those
would
apply.
we
think
that
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
don't
think
new
york
times
does
apply.
i
think
that
if
there's
any
application
it
might
be
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir
because
we
wanted
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i
was
in
effect
assuming
arguendo
because
i
wanted
the
instructions
of
the
jury
to
be
as
broad
as
possible.
i
did
not
want
any
decision
to
rest
on
any
narrow
definition
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
what's
it?
mr.
abraham
chasanow
only
insofar
as
this
court
itself
has
narrowed.
for
example,
in
new
york
times,
the
court
said
about
eight
times
that
this
referred
to
the
official
conduct
of
a
public
official.
then
--
there's
nothing
to
do
with
the
official
conduct
of
mr.
bresler.
so
we
say
if
new
york
times
applies,
then
perhaps,
it's
just
as
goldberg's
statement
which
says
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
private
activities
of
a
public
official.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes,
sir,
we
couldn't,
we
couldn't
deny
it.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
the
fact
that
they
had
made
him
one,
as
one
who
was
participating
--
well,
i'd
have
to
go
back
to
1934
--
i
mean,
60
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir,
i
think
i
could
point
out
more
clearly
what
made
him
a
public
figure.
in
1964
on
may
7
when
there
was
some
dispute,
some
discussion
of
the
council,
the
news
review
published
a
report
that
the
council
and
the
audience
decided
it
made
much
more
sense
to
it,
stop
attacking
each
other
and
concentrate
on
a
common
target,
bresler
who
wasn't
there
and
that
was
when
they
decided
that
they
had
to
have
a
scapegoat
because
bresler
only
owned
a
minority
interest
in
these
properties.
he
was
not
the
major
owner.
there
were
others
who
owned
more
of
an
interest
than
he,
but
they
had
to
have
a
name
and
his
was
a
name
that
was
selected.
they
were
--
this
was
followed
up
by
the
group
sponsored
by
greenbelt
homes.
mr.
schwan
who
was
president,
in
which
they
announced
on
april,
8,
1965
that
the
saved
greenbelt
group
gets
its
officers
a
name
cfpg
and
they
formed
this
organization
with
mr.
schwan
with
mayor
smith
with
albert
herling
who
made
one
of
the
blackmail
accusations
with
mrs.
skolnick
and
then
on
april,
22,
they
announced
not
only
a
citizenship
assistant
wide
--
a
citywide
membership
drive
but
had
an
article,
city
battles
bresler
on
two
fronts.
he
was
singled
out
by
the
news
review
and
that
was
when
they
made
the
false
allegation
with
the
subtitle
court
suit
that
the
city
and
bresler
will
be
at
odds.
now,
bresler
was
not
a
defendant
in
that
case
and
they
knew
it.
even
later,
on
may,
6,
after
there
had
been
a
hearing
and
after
the
court
had
issued
an
order
against
ivy
homes,
inc.
in
which
bresler
had
no
interest
whatsoever,
this
was
what
the
news
review
said,
“at
a
hearing
held
two
weeks
ago,
a
court
order
was
issued
to
the
builders
of
boxwood,
another
bresler
development.”
bresler
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
development
to
which
the
court
urged,
but
they
wanted
to
feature
his
name.
the
exhibit
showed
that
they
constantly
featured
his
name.
this
is
like
the
man
who
pleaded
for
leniency
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
orphan
after
he
had
shot
his
parents.
they
had
made
him
a
public
figure
and
they
were
using
this.
they
were
using
the
public
official
defense
even
though
they
knew
that
there
was
no
relation
and
there
was
no
mention
in
the
articles.
but
getting
through
the
time
when
they
announced
charles
bresler
to
run
for
state
comptroller
on
june,
9,
1966,
and
this
is
where
we
get
into
the
question
of
malice.
now,
they
point
out
that
this
lawsuit
that
was
filed
about
mr.
bresler
was
subsequent,
it
had
nothing
to
do.
but
taking
the
chronology
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
this
was
after
the
blackmail
charge.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
after
the
blackmail
charge,
there
were
other
defamations.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
we
consider
that
the
blackmail,
skullduggery,
false
reports
of
lawsuits
for
violation
of
building
standards
which
damaged
him
as
a
builder,
those
were
probably
the
most
serious.
there
were
other
articles
about
possible
corrupt
influence
on
the
school
board
in
which
his
name
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
suit
against
the
school
board.
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
but
they
mentioned
--
they
featured
his
name.
it's
hard
to
say
which
draw
broke
the
camel's
back
but
we
thought
there
was
an
accumulation
which
certainly
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
certainly
made
him
the
most
hated
man
in
greenbelt.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
dispute
about
that
and
we
think
that
the
accumulative
effect
of
these
articles,
even
those
which
were
not
necessarily
libelous
per
se,
which
were
intended
to
and
did
in
fact
damage
him,
but
describe
it
to
indicate
the
process.
they
announced
he
was
going
to
run
for
state
comptroller
on
june
9
and
that's
when
they
have
the
article
which
had
several
false
statements
and
this
time,
in
that
article,
he
was
identified
as
a
builder.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
as
a
builder.
not
to
mentioned
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
delegates,
but
as
a
developer
and
builder.
it
said
he
is
currently
faced
with
a
series
of
legal
actions
instituted
by
the
city
of
greenbelt
and
referred
to
this
suit
which
had
been
dismissed
almost
a
year
before
and
then
also
that
false
report
that
a
number
of
homeowners
in
lake
crescent
parks
with
developed
and
started
legal
proceedings
against
him.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
it
did.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
oh,
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
it
not
--
would
not
be
the
governing
factor
but
i
think
it
would
at
least
if
they
were
saying
we
have
the
right
to
criticize
a
candidate
for
office,
there
certainly
might
be
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
does
hold
the
political
office.
if
there
was
a
question
he
was
qualified
for
that
office,
may
be
there
should
be
some
question
about
it
but
we
don't
contend
this
is
a
major
premise.
we
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
was
damaging
as
we
alleged
to
his
reputation
as
a
builder,
his
violation
of
county
building
standards
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
public
issue.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
sir,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
though.
there
had
been
articles
published
about
the
time.
there
still
are,
there
was
one
in
this
morning
about
bribe
--
relating
to
bribery
on
zoning
in
prince
george,
this
had
been
a
burning
issue
in
prince
george's
county
and
virginia.
the
people
in
greenbelt
were
very
aware
of
this.
now,
to
them,
the
fact
that
somebody
was
threatening
to
prevent
the
building
of
a
school,
i
would
think
would
be
much
more
serious
than
just
bribing
some
official
with
a
couple
hundred
dollars.
the
jury
obviously
felt
that
they
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mrs.
skolnick
when
asked,
did
you
believe
that
--
or
did
you
intend
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
or
did
you
think
that
the
article
--
that
the
statements
were
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
were
proper,
she
said
yes,
in
the
context
of
the
meeting
they
were
proper.
there
was
no
question
that
they
intended
to
defame
him.
these
were
not
someone
whom
the
news
review
was
reporting,
these
were
their
own
people
making
these
statements
so
the
news
review
could
publish
them
and
it
was
intended
to
inflame
the
people
to
the
point
where
they
felt
he
had
committed
a
crime.
i
certainly
think
that
anyone
who
would
stop
the
building
of
a
school
would
be
verging
on
something
criminal
particularly
when
they
themselves
in
their
brief
mention
coerced
and
threatened.
this
is
what
the
general
public
feels,
this
blackmail,
coercion
and
threats.
i
think
the
whole
posture
of
the
case
that
the
fact
that
at
that
meeting,
they
read
an
inflammatory
statement
to
begin
with
by
mr.
schwan
and
then
the
statements
were
made
indicate
the
whole
purpose
was
to
cause
these
inflammatory
statements
to
be
made
so
they
could
publish
them
and
republish
them
the
following
week
when
mr.
herling
was
a
member
of
that
group,
made
the
blackmail
statement.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
no,
we
did
not
claim
any
pecuniary
loss
because
how
can
we
prove
that
people
would
not
buy
any
of
the
houses
because
he
wasn't
building
according
to
county
standards,
there
is
no
way
of
proving
that
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
chasanow
yes
sir,
they
felt
i'm
sure
that
there
had
been
pecuniary
loss
as
well
as
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
well,
i
think
they
were
conditioned
by
the
statements
made
about
this
poor
newspaper.
i
think
that
there
might
have
been
a
lot
greater,
in
fact,
my
discussion
with
a
couple
of
jurors
later
indicated
that
it
could
have
been
a
good
deal
more.
i
think
the
jury
--
mr.
abraham
chasanow
i'm
sorry
sir,
but
i
think
that
they
tried
to
be
temperate.
i
think
it
indicated
that
they
did
reach
what
they
felt
was
a
verdict
fair
to
both
sides.
we
think
that
this
whole
pattern
and
i'm
sorry
that
the
exhibits
are
not
in
chronological
order
indicated
that
they
were
leading
up
to,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
filing
of
the
suit
against
mr.
bresler
which
was
an
absolutely
privileged
action
was
followed
shortly
after
the
announcement
of
his
candidacy
and
we
felt
that
this
whole
pattern
of
announcement
week
after
week
with
a
combination
of
a
suit
and
the
misrepresentation
as
to
the
purpose
of
collecting
the
money
for
the
suit
was
an
indication
that
they
had
intended
to
damage
him
all
the
way
through
that
this
was
a
continuing
action.
we
think
that
obviously
the
jury
was
convinced
that
they
intended
to
accuse
him
of
blackmail
and
that
is
what
a
layman
reading
the
article
would
have
felt,
particularly
when
there
was
no
reason
to
publish
the
caption
blackmail
unless
they
wanted
to
invite
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
accused
of
blackmail,
that
he
was
a
criminal.
i
thank
you.
