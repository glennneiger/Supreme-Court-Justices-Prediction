justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
chasanow,
may
i
ask?
do
i
understand
that
the
respondent
concedes
that
he
had
the
burden
of
satisfying
the
new
york
times
test
to
get
a
recovery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
asking,
but
the
respondent
does
concede
the
judgment
sustains
only
if
it
satisfied
the
times
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
reading
the
--
what
i
must
confess
a
rather
confusing
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
particularly
on
two
occasions
as
i
read
it,
the
jury
was
called
back
and
given
rather
explicit
instructions
as
i
understand
it
quoting
verbatim
not
only
from
sullivan
but
also
from
garrison
and
from
rosenblatt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
why
i
asked
you
how
--
this
case
certainly
was
tried
wasn't
it,
on
the
premise
that
the
respondent
recovered
only
if
he
satisfied
the
times
malice
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
we
then
to
regard
that
the
issues
that
we
have
to
decide
as
on
the
premise
that
this
is
a
case
within
the
times-sullivan
requirement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it's
not
a
new
york
times
case,
then
actually
that
principle
doesn't
apply
and
is
there
anything
that
this
court's
ever
said
what
the
federal
constitution
does
about
a
state's
libel
action?
if
he's
not
either
a
public
official
or
a
public
figure,
why
is
the
case
here
at
all
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
certainly
made
no
objection
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
i
read
the
instructions
correctly.
i
think
you
were
party
weren't
you,
you
tried
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
were
party
to
those
supplemental
instructions
which
i
mentioned
to
you
earlier
that
borrowed
in
terms
from
the
new
york
times
a
series
of
cases
to
instruct
the
jury,
not
only
didn't
object
to
it
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
participated
in
that,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
told
the
jury
to
consider
all
45
exhibits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
on
that,
didn't
the
--
if
jury
as
i
read
this,
like
it
came
back
twice
and
on
the
second
occasion,
the
judge
--
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
but
when
they
came
back,
he
didn't
say
in
so
many
words,
forget
everything
i
said
to
you
about
spite,
ill
will
and
so
forth.
the
law
of
the
case
is
the
new
york
times
rule
and
any,
as
i
read
it,
what
he
did
was
read
them
the
actual
language
out
of
the
opinions
in
times,
garrison
and
rosenblatt,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
--
did
what
--
did
the
jury
then
have
the
case
on
the
basis,
forget
all
about
everything
i
said
to
you
on
spite,
ill
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this?
i
gather
from
what
you
said
to
me
earlier.
after
the
new
york
times
charge
was
given,
the
correct
one,
mr.
clark,
that
was
trial
counsel
i
gather
for
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
said
that
he
still
objected
in
view
of
the
prior
instructions
that
have
gone
before
this
in
which
malice
is
averted
to
as
involving
hostility
that
this
should
be
made
clear
to
the
jury
that
evidence
of
evil
motive,
ill
will,
hostility
does
not
constitute
malice
within
the
definition
of
the
constitution.
i
gather
even
had
that
been
given,
you'd
still
be
here,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
there
is
any
issue
whether
this
is
a
case
involving
the
times
test,
in
that
event?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
a
public
figure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
any
--
did
mr.
bresler
take
the
position
at
trial
at
any
time
that
he
was
not
a
public
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apparently
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
had
some
question
about
it
because
it
did
say
to
treat
the
case
as
a
times
case
was
more
favorable
to
your
client
than
what's
he
entitled
to
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
you
can
see
we
have
to
be
satisfied
he's
at
least
a
public
figure
before
we
have
any
question
before
us
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
chasanow,
may
i
ask?

i
