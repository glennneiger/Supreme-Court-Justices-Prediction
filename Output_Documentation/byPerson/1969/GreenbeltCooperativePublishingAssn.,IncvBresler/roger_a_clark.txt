mr.
roger
a.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
for
alleged
libel.
petitioners
are
a
small
community
newspaper,
the
greenbelt
news
review
and
its
president.
the
respondent,
bresler
is
a
major
builder/developer
in
greenbelt
whose
building
activities
there
have
previously
received
wide
publicity
as
to
their
importance
and
magnitude
in
the
community.
mr.
bresler
had
numerous
dealings
with
the
city
council
and
other
government
agencies
in
an
effort
to
get
their
approval
for
his
zoning
plans.
and
his
counsel
conceded
in
his
opening
statement
that
mr.
bresler
was
a
public
figure
in
greenbelt.
also
during
this
period,
he
was
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
and
later
a
candidate
for
comptroller
of
the
state.
no
actual
damages
were
shown
or
claimed.
the
jury
verdict
was
entered
for
$5,000.00
compensatory
damages,
$12,500.00
punitive
damages
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
two
of
the
three
articles
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
upon
to
support
this
judgment
are
accurate
reports
of
public
debate
that
two
city
council
meetings,
two
greenbelt
city
council
meetings
regarding
bresler's
proposal
to
the
city
in
which
he
tried
to
pressure
the
city
into
supporting
his
request
for
higher
density
zoning
for
a
large
tract
of
land
in
the
center
of
the
city.
he
did
this
by
saying
that
he
would
agree
to
sell
another
tract
which
he
owned
in
the
city
and
unfortunately
the
school
board
wanted
--
which
the
school
board
want
to
build
a
school
which
the
city
desired,
he
would
sell
that
only
if
the
city
agreed
to
his
zoning
request.
otherwise,
he
would
insist
on
lengthy
condemnation
proceedings
which
would
delay
construction
of
a
high
school
site.
now,
the
first
of
the
two
articles
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
211
and
if
i
may
since
it's
so
critical
to
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
go
through
that
article
just
the
key
points
shortly.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
correct
your
honor
and
my
argument
is
primarily
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law
to
let
this
case
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
the
first
place
and
therefore
the
court
erred
in
denying
my
motions
for
directed
verdict
and
for
judgment
n.o.v.
i'm
also
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
am
resting
on
the
record,
yes
your
honor.
going
to
the
article
that
forms
the
basis
of
this
suit,
the
article
is
entitled
school
site
stirs
up
council,
rezoning
deal
offer
debated.
article
makes
clear
that
the
--
the
article
is
now
discussing
a
proposal
to
the
city
council
and
the
debate
on
that
proposal.
the
first
paragraph
of
the
article,
delaying
construction
of
a
new
greenbelt
high
school
is
the
lever
by
which
a
local
developer
is
pressuring
the
city
to
endorse
his
bid
for
higher
density
rezoning.
so
citizens
were
told
at
a
crowded
meeting
in
the
city
council.
the
next
two
paragraphs
explain
how
the
school
board
had
previously
been
trying
to
get
the
land.
and
at
the
top
of
the
next
page
or
the
fourth
paragraph
in
the
article,
the
proposal,
bresler's
proposal
to
the
city
council
is
fully
and
accurately
set
forth.
it's
only
at
that
point
after
it's
clearly
established
in
the
article
that
the
conduct
being
criticized
is
the
proposal.
the
proposal
is
set
forth
clearly.
the
fact
that
it
was
publicly
made
is
set
forth
and
the
fact
that
what
was
involved
here
was
merely
a
threat
to
use
his
legal
right
to
delay
the
condemnation
edges,
the
right
of
any
landowner
to
insist
upon
a
condemnation
proceeding.
it's
only
at
this
point
that
the
article
begins
to
describe
the
very
hostile
public
reaction,
the
city
council
meeting
to
this
proposal
and
the
sixth
paragraph,
that
accurately
reports
that
a
number
of
people
at
the
meeting
accurately
characterized
--
i
mean
a
number
of
people
has
just
been
actually
--
excuse
me,
the
article
accurately
reports
that
a
number
of
people
at
the
meeting
characterized
this
proposal
as
an
attempt
to
blackmail
the
city.
the
--
looking
on
the
sixth
paragraph,
it
says,
it
seems
that
this
is
a
slight
case
of
blackmail
commented
mrs.
marjorie
bergemann
and
the
word
was
echoed
by
many
speakers
from
the
audience.
immediately
after
that
reference
to
mrs.
bergemann,
a
city
councilman
was
quoted
as
saying
that
it's
not
blackmail.
he
preferred
to
call
it
just
two-way
negotiations
and
the
article
goes
on
and
lists
other
criticisms
of
the
thing
and
the
following
comment
demonstrates
exactly
what
the
people
at
the
council
meeting
objected
to.
he
said,
“everybody
knows
there
is
a
need
for
a
school.”
the
developer
knows
there
is
a
need
and
says,
“we'll
meet
your
need
if
you
meet
our
need.”
that's
what
the
people
were
referring
to
when
they
were
referring
to
this
article
as
blackmail.
the
second
article
is
much
the
same
thing.
it's
the
report
of
a
second
city
council
meeting
and
at
which
there
was
further
debate
on
the
same
proposal
and
the
city
council
finally
voted
four
to
one
to
reject
that.
in
that
article,
another
participant
is
quoted
the
same,
“fight
bresler's
blackmail”
in
an
attempt
to
tell
the
city
to
vote
the
proposal
down.
right
after
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
would
be
on
page
two,
16.
and
right
after
that,
another
participant
debate
is
quoted
as
saying
that,
“this
isn't
blackmail
but
the
legitimate
advance
in
mr.
bresler's
right
to
advance
his
rights
to
develop
his
land.”
now,
the
decision
below
rests
on
the
proposition,
the
incredible
proposition
i
believe
that
these
articles
charged
bresler
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
and
the
petitioners
knew
they
were
charging
him
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
anybody
interpreted
this
article
as
charged
in
a
crime
of
blackmail.
bresler
could
identify
no
one
who
read
the
articles
that
way.
he
couldn't
explain
why
he
himself
claimed
that
they
charged
him
with
a
crime
of
blackmail.
he
couldn't
explain
what
conduct
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
charged
with
that
would
constitute
the
crime
of
blackmail.
nor
was
he
able
to
explain
why
he
ignored
the
articles
for
nine
months
until
he
brought
this
$2
million
libel
suit
at
a
time
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
campaign
for
state
comptroller
and
the
news
review
was
accurately
criticizing
his
disregard
of
certain
land
covenants
and
his
misrepresentations
to
the
city
council
in
connection
therewith
that
--
on
another
matter.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
the
--
for
the
reason
stated
on
my
brief,
the
instructions
permitted
the
jury
to
allow
recovery
if
they
found
that
this
was
an
intemperate
or
excessive
statement
and
it
was
motivated
by
a
sense
of
spite
or
hostility.
that
report
so
i
don't
think
the
jury
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
libel,
this
was
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
that
you
could
find
that
a
--
on
the
maryland
rule
of
fair
comment.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
they
first
had
to
find
that
a
libelous
statement
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
think
so
under
the
instructions
that
were
given.
the
instructions
were
rather
lengthy
and
somewhat
confusing
but
i
think
the
jury
could
very
well
have
found
from
the
instructions
given
that
the
defendant
could
recover
if
they
found
that
a
statement
was
solely
intemperate
or
excessive
as
to
indicate
that
it
was
other
--could
only
have
been
activated
by
actual
malice.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
under
the
instructions
of
the
court,
it
had
to
find
a
libelous
statement.
however,
when
you
read
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
my
point
is
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
here.
if
you
read
the
articles,
anybody
who
reads
the
articles
to
that
point
is
--
it
is
clear
to
them
what
conduct
is
involved
here
and
that
that
conduct
has
no
relationship
to
the
crime
of
blackmail.
if
the
jury
found
that,
and
i
don't
believe
they
did
under
the
instructions.
if
the
jury
found
that,
my
position
here
is
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
from
which
they
could
make
that
judgment.
moreover
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioners
intended
this
strained
meeting.
the
only
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
court
was
petitioner's
testimony
that
the
word
blackmail
in
another
context
could
charge
the
commission
of
a
crime.
and
that
there
was
nothing
at
the
meeting
which
indicated
that
bresler
committed
the
crime
of
blackmail.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
on
that
testimony
alone
which
assumed
that
the
petitioners
intended
to
charge
a
crime
didn't
--
there
was
no
evidence,
they
just
assumed
that,
that
it
would
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
case
in
which
there
was
more
convincing
evidence
that
appellants
had
knowledge
of
a
falsity
of
the
charge
or
in
fact
entertain
serious
doubts.
this
holding
i
submit
is
nothing
less
than
a
mockery
of
the
new
york
times
role.
you
can't
establish
falsity
much
less
knowing
falsity
by
taking
a
word
out
of
context
and
ascribing
to
a
meaning
--
ascribing
to
it
a
meaning
that
is
wholly
different
from
that
which
it
cont
--
it's
context
dictates.
no
one
i
submit
reasonably
can
conclude
from
this
article
that
the
petitioners
intended
to
charge
mr.
bresler
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
which
was
defined
to
the
jury
in
the
court's
instructions
is
the
extortion
of
money
by
threats
of
criminal
prosecution
or
embarrassment,
threats
of
disclosure.
the
article
by
making
it
clear
what
conduct
that
bresler
was
being
criticized,
what
that
conduct
was,
that
it
was
publicly
made,
a
proposal
publicly
made
in
the
city
completely
negates
any
reasonable
finding
that
the
crime
of
blackmail
was
charged
or
that
the
petitioners
intended
the
crime
--
the
charge
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
exactly
right
and
the
use
of
the
word
blackmail
to
characterize
that
is
no
more
stronger
and
temperate
than
you
see
everyday
in
major
metropolitan
newspapers,
responsible
newspapers.
i
have
collected
those
articles
in
appendix
8
of
our
brief
and
you'll
see
that
both
the
post
and
the
star
reported
channing
phillips
characterization
of
congressman
natcher's
delaying
the
subway
funds
on
the
construction
of
the
three
sisters
bridge
is
blackmail.
the
post
characterized
editorially.
senator
fulbright's
attempt
to
force
a
change
in
vietnam
policy
by
stalling
legislation
is
nothing
less
than
blackmail.
these
strong
expressions
are
the
essence
of
spirited
debate.
they're
the
essence
of
the
robust
uninhibited
wide
open
debate
that
this
court
has
sought
to
protect
in
the
sullivan
case
and
all
the
cases
that
have
burrowed
from
it.
if
the
press
must
run
the
risk
that
they
will
be
taken
out
of
context
and
given
an
ominous
meaning
to
support
substantial
libel
judgments,
then
debate
will
clearly
be
inhibited.
i
think
the
respondent
recognizes
the
weakness
of
this
central
holding
of
the
court
by
attempting
to
shift
the
focus
to
other
articles
that
were
in
issue.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
$5,000.00
compensatory
damages
and
$12,000
by
--
$12,500.00
punitive
damages
which
had
a
far
greater
impact
on
this
small
paper
than
the
$500,000.00
judgments
against
the
new
york
times
in
the
sullivan
case.
as
i
say,
respondent
focused
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
excuse
me.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
--
well,
of
course
the
jury
verdict
does
not
make
that
clear.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
they
were
given
the
standard
instructions
on
punitive
damages
that
if
they
found
that
the
defendant's
acted
with
spite
or
hostility
that
they
would
--
to
be
allowed
to
recover
punitive
damages.
the
only
other
article
and
issue
which
the
court
relies
on
the
support
of
this
verdict
is
an
article
entitled
charles
bresler
to
run
for
state
comptroller
and
it
listed
on
the
eve
of
his
announcement
as
a
candidate
for
state
comptroller,
lists
his
dealings
in
the
community
and
there's
a
statement
in
there
that
a
number
of
homeowners
had
started
legal
proceedings
against
him
for
failure
to
make
construction
corrections
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
now,
the
basis
for
this
article
was
clearly
set
forth
in
the
record.
15
to
20
homeowners
at
a
public
meeting
told
the
news
review's
reporter
after
a
public
meeting,
told
the
news
review
reporter
that
they
had
gone
to
their
lawyers
and
they
had
filed
complaints
with
county
officials
regarding
their
homes
which
the
reporter
interpreted
as
starting
legal
proceedings.
many
of
these
people
were
personally
known
to
the
reporter,
mrs.
skolnick
or
they
--
she
recognized
them
as
residents
of
the
community.
she'd
has
also
previously
heard
similar
complaints
from
other
people
in
the
developments.
all
of
the
homeowners
with
whom
she
talked
identified
bresler
as
the
builder
that
--
with
whom
they
were
dealing.
bresler
himself
conceded
that
he'd
received
a
number
of
complaints
and
that
he
responded
to
those
complaints.
moreover,
it
subsequently
turned
out
that
one
suit
had
been
filed
and
two
suits
were
subsequently
filed,
they
got
three
suits
were
subsequently
filed
against
corporations
in
which
he
was
a
principal.
now,
the
claim
of
falsity
here
is
very
narrow.
the
claim
of
falsity
is
that
by
saying
started
legal
proceedings
is
--
that
statement
is
false
because
no
suit
had
been
filed
against
him
personally.
now,
the
gist
of
the
article
of
course
that
a
number
of
homeowners,
substantial
number
of
homeowners
in
the
community
were
complaining
about
defects
in
his
homes,
that
was
true.
the
trial
court
paid
little
attention
to
this
article.
he
mentioned
in
his
--
in
denying
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
that
this
article
didn't
bother
him.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
that
the
failure
by
the
reporter
to
check
court
records
or
to
call
bresler
before
reporting
this
information
was
sufficient
evidence
to
constitute
a
fining
of
recklessness.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
information
that
the
court
said
that
mrs.
skolnick
should
have
checked
the
court
records
to
determine
whether
lawsuits
had
actually
been
filed
against
bresler
personally,
and
this
finding
is
completely
at
odds
with
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
garrison
and
st.
amant
that
there
must
be
some
evidence
that
the
publisher
was
aware
of
a
possible
inaccuracy
or
probable
inaccuracy
in
this
article.
there's
no
finding
or
evidence
here
that
petitioners
had
any
doubt
as
to
the
accuracy
of
this
report.
since
they
have
gotten
their
information
from
a
number
of
homeowners
who
were
apparently
responsible
and
who
presumably
were
speaking
from
firsthand
knowledge
and
who
had
in
fact
complained
to
bresler
and
in
fact
gone
to
their
lawyers,
they
had
not
reason
to
doubt
their
--
this
information
or
to
investigate
further.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
bresler
was
a
part
owner
and
at
the
trial,
he
denied
that
at
this
point
in
time
he
was
active
in
the
corporation.
however,
a
contemporaneous
affidavit
which
he
filed
in
another
case,
completely
unrelated
case,
filed
right
at
the
same
time
said
he
was
the
vice
president
of
the
corporation
in
charge
of
all
sales
and
the
critical
thing
from
the
standpoint
of
the
reporter's
was
that
bresler
was
the
one
who
dealt
with
all
of
the
complaining
homeowners,
homeowners
naturally
personalize
the
builder.
they
don't
think
it's
x
corporation
or
y
corporation.
they
think
about
it
in
terms
of
zeckendorf
or
yonas
or
whoever
the
builder
happens
to
be,
they
tend
to
personalize
this
and
they
were
talking
about
bresler
and
bresler
was
the
one
who
responded
to
their
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
what?
they
were
saying
that
he
had
failed
to
make
corrections
in
their
homes
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
there
was
--
were
claiming
that
he
had
failed
to
correct
deficiencies
in
their
homes,
that
his
development
built.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
deficiencies
in
the
homes.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
they
were
equating
him
with
the
company
and
the
developer.
he
was
the
--
to
them,
bresler
was
the
builder.
he
was
the
one
that
acted
for
the
builders,
it
as
his
corporation
that
was
failing
to
perform.
so
they
were
equating
bresler
with
his
corporation.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
a
failing
to
make
corrections
to
bring
their
houses
up
to
snuff.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
all.
now,
the
court
responding
to
mr.
justice
white's
observation
start,
i
do
claim
that
the
instructions
here
are
clearly
wrong.
throughout
the
instructions,
the
court
repeatedly
instructed
that
the
defendants
could
recover,
i
mean
the
plaintiff
could
recover
if
he
showed
actual
malice
which
was
defined
as
spite,
hostility
or
deliberate
intention
to
harm.
now
the
clause
of
the
--
his
instructions,
the
court
did
give
an
instruction,
an
incomplete
instruction
on
the
new
york
times
rule,
but
he
failed
to
instruct
the
court
that
spite,
hostility
and
ill
will
as
he
had
repeatedly
defined
it
before
was
not
sufficient
to
permit
recovery.
also
the
court
refused
to
rule
out
near
negligence
as
a
proof
of
references.
i
don't
emphasize
here
these
erroneous
instructions
because
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
three
articles
upon
which
the
court
relied,
are
clearly
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
permit
recovery
under
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
you
could
not
but
you
could
be
--
you
could
not
recover
and
that
our
position
also
is
that
this
unfounded
litigation
as
such
--
been
such
a
strain
on
this
small
newspaper
that
if
we
--
if
you
simply
reverse
on
the
basis
of
the
instructions
which
are
clearly
erroneous
as
there
will
be
a
denial
of
the
first
amendment
protection.
therefore
i
ask
the
court
to
review
the
record
and
determine
that
it
does
not
contain
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
verdict
under
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
comment
briefly
on
justice
white's
question
about
the
instructions.
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
instructions,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
trial
court
singled
out
only
the
blackmail
article.
in
fact,
he
referred
to
it
three
times
in
his
instructions
and
did
not
refer
to
any
of
the
other
articles
which
the
only
other
article
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
except
generally,
the
only
other
article
that
he
relied
on
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
think
that
you
--
from
the
--
reading
the
instructions
though,
you
will
see
that
the
focus
of
the
case,
and
so
only
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
on
the
term
blackmail
and
that
was
the
--
you
get
that
clearly
from
reading
the
joint
extract,
you
get
that
clearly
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
your
honor
except
that
there's
only
one
other
article
in
issue
about
which
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
factually
inaccurate.
not
just
one
about
the
homeowners'
proceedings
which
is
just
a
really
piddling
inaccuracy
when
you
take
it
against
the
fact
that
they
knew
in
the
way
they
reported
it.
this
reference
in
the
instructions
to
the
blackmail
i
think
is
helpful
in
answering
the
question,
the
point
that
you
made
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
explicit
references
to
new
york
times
at
the
end
of
this
--
at
the
end
of
the
court's
instructions.
the
court
instructed
that
the
jury
that
--
going
to
the
factor
of
truth,
there
was
no
contention
in
this
case.
it
is
conceded
by
the
defendants
that
these
allegations
were
not
true,
that
bresler
committed
the
crime
of
blackmail,
that
bresler
was
guilty
of
blackmail.
so
in
the
background
of
that
reference
when
the
court
after
it
instructed
the
jury
that
malices,
ill
wills,
spite
or
hostility
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
second
is
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
it
is
essentially
right
as
the
judge
instructed
after
the
lunch
break.
the
jury
hadn't
been
out.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
if
he
had
said
that,
i
think
that
would've
cured
substantially
much
of
the
error
that
had
taken
place
but
he
didn't
simply
give
the
new
york
times
instruction,
this
is
why
i
get
back
to
this,
a
bit
about
we
conceded
that
the
allegations
of
blackmail
were
false
because
when
he
gets
into
the
new
york
times
instruction
at
the
end,
he
prefaces
his
comment
with,
there
is
no
contention
here
that
the
statements
regarding
blackmail
were
true.
so
he's
really
instructing
the
jury
that
we
had
conceded
the
statements
were
false,
that
meets
the
new
york
times
--
would
meet
the
new
york
times,
does
in
effect
--
underwrites
the
instruction
completely.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
it
--
the
fact
that
we
did
not
contend
that
the
articles
were
true
meant
that
we
conceded
that
this
is
what
the
instruction
--
that
we
conceded
that
they
can
--
that
the
allegations
were
false.
now,
we
if
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
but
if
we
concede,
yes,
that's
exactly
right
and
that's
what
the
court,
led
--
i
believe
led
the
jury
to
believe
that
we
had
conceded
that
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right,
and
then
he
further
instructed
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
charged
a
crime.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
charged
a
crime.
and
then
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
but
then
he
gives
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
he
gives
them
the
further
instruction
that
we
conceded
that,
that
we
conceded
that
the
allegations
were
not
true,
that
bresler
was
guilty
of
blackmail.
so
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
i
don't
concede
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
would
concede
that,
but
i
wouldn't
concede
that
the
allegations
in
the
article
are
false
and
i
think
that
was
misleading
to
the
jury.
what's
lacking
here
obviously
is
an
instruction,
that
clear
instruction
that
the
defendant,
that
the
defendants
not
only
charged
this
but
that
they
knew
they
were
charging,
that
they
intended
to
charge
this
strained
and
really
ludicrous
meaning
that
they
knew
it,
they
knew
it
was
false.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
yes,
i
certainly
would
still
be
here
because
i
don't
think
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
allow
a
jury
to
make
that
finding.
i
think
for
a
jury
to
find
that
this
article
charge
was
the
crime
of
blackmail
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
think
that's
very
clear
that
this
is
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
he
is
a
public
figure.
not
only
did
he
concede
that
he
was
a
public
figure
but
there
was
previous
widespread
publicity
in
the
washington
post
and
other
metropolitan
papers
about
his
--
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
his
duties.
there
are
vast
private
developments
planned
in
25-year-old
community
lauding
mr.
bresler's
activities
and
the
scope
and
magnitude
of
those
activities.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
in
fact
his
counsel
conceded
it
in
his
opening
statement
and
the
articles
went
to
--
the
blackmail
articles
went
to
a
public
issue
that
he
raised
the
issue
with
the
city
council
by
making
a
proposal
to
it.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
think
the
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
substance
but
i
don't
think
they
were
looking
to
the
fact
that
his
public
official
capacity
only
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
and
i
think
that
the
citizens
of
greenbelt
had
as
much
interest
in
this
zoning
proposal
which
affected
how
a
large
proportions
of
their
community
was
going
to
be
developed
as
much
interest
certainly
as
the
general
public
had
in
wally
butts'
college
football
experience.
the
only
other
reference
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
preference
to
--
by
the
--
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
conceded
the
statements
were
false
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
a
very
lengthy
and
confused
instruction
that
you
could
recover
on
other
basis.
the
other
thing
quickly
is
the
skullduggery
comment.
the
skullduggery
comment
is
a
rather
a
novel
theory.
there
is
no
--
it
doesn't
refer
to
bresler.
there's
no
indication
that
the
--
it
--
the
condensation
of
the
skullduggery
word,
the
condensation
was
inaccurate.
there's
no
indication
of
the
underlying
comments
were
inaccurate.
all
it
was,
was
criticism
of
the
school
board
in
delaying
the
condemnation
actually
but
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
think
it's
certainly
a
very
serious
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
would
have
to
say
no.
certainly
when
it's
directed
to
a
public
body,
an
impersonal
reference
to
an
official
action
by
a
public
body
as
we
had
in
the
rosenblatt
case,
i
would
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
have
to
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
because
they
didn't
charge
a
private
citizen,
they
charged
the
school
board.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
the
context
of
what
was
involved,
in
other
words,
the
postponement
of
a
condemnation
action
by
an
official
governmental
body,
i
don't
believe
that
that
arises
to
be
stature
of
a
libelous
statement
under
the
constitution.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
certainly
is
my
point
and
also
there
is
just
no
showing
it's
false.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no
attempt
to
make
that.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
for
alleged
libel.
petitioners
are
a
small
community
newspaper,
the
greenbelt
news
review
and
its
president.
the
respondent,
bresler
is
a
major
builder/developer
in
greenbelt
whose
building
activities
there
have
previously
received
wide
publicity
as
to
their
importance
and
magnitude
in
the
community.
mr.
bresler
had
numerous
dealings
with
the
city
council
and
other
government
agencies
in
an
effort
to
get
their
approval
for
his
zoning
plans.
and
his
counsel
conceded
in
his
opening
statement
that
mr.
bresler
was
a
public
figure
in
greenbelt.
also
during
this
period,
he
was
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
and
later
a
candidate
for
comptroller
of
the
state.
no
actual
damages
were
shown
or
claimed.
the
jury
verdict
was
entered
for
$5,000.00
compensatory
damages,
$12,500.00
punitive
damages
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
two
of
the
three
articles
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
upon
to
support
this
judgment
are
accurate
reports
of
public
debate
that
two
city
council
meetings,
two
greenbelt
city
council
meetings
regarding
bresler's
proposal
to
the
city
in
which
he
tried
to
pressure
the
city
into
supporting
his
request
for
higher
density
zoning
for
a
large
tract
of
land
in
the
center
of
the
city.
he
did
this
by
saying
that
he
would
agree
to
sell
another
tract
which
he
owned
in
the
city
and
unfortunately
the
school
board
wanted
--
which
the
school
board
want
to
build
a
school
which
the
city
desired,
he
would
sell
that
only
if
the
city
agreed
to
his
zoning
request.
otherwise,
he
would
insist
on
lengthy
condemnation
proceedings
which
would
delay
construction
of
a
high
school
site.
now,
the
first
of
the
two
articles
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
211
and
if
i
may
since
it's
so
critical
to
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
go
through
that
article
just
the
key
points
shortly.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
correct
your
honor
and
my
argument
is
primarily
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law
to
let
this
case
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
the
first
place
and
therefore
the
court
erred
in
denying
my
motions
for
directed
verdict
and
for
judgment
n.o.v.
i'm
also
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
am
resting
on
the
record,
yes
your
honor.
going
to
the
article
that
forms
the
basis
of
this
suit,
the
article
is
entitled
school
site
stirs
up
council,
rezoning
deal
offer
debated.
article
makes
clear
that
the
--
the
article
is
now
discussing
a
proposal
to
the
city
council
and
the
debate
on
that
proposal.
the
first
paragraph
of
the
article,
delaying
construction
of
a
new
greenbelt
high
school
is
the
lever
by
which
a
local
developer
is
pressuring
the
city
to
endorse
his
bid
for
higher
density
rezoning.
so
citizens
were
told
at
a
crowded
meeting
in
the
city
council.
the
next
two
paragraphs
explain
how
the
school
board
had
previously
been
trying
to
get
the
land.
and
at
the
top
of
the
next
page
or
the
fourth
paragraph
in
the
article,
the
proposal,
bresler's
proposal
to
the
city
council
is
fully
and
accurately
set
forth.
it's
only
at
that
point
after
it's
clearly
established
in
the
article
that
the
conduct
being
criticized
is
the
proposal.
the
proposal
is
set
forth
clearly.
the
fact
that
it
was
publicly
made
is
set
forth
and
the
fact
that
what
was
involved
here
was
merely
a
threat
to
use
his
legal
right
to
delay
the
condemnation
edges,
the
right
of
any
landowner
to
insist
upon
a
condemnation
proceeding.
it's
only
at
this
point
that
the
article
begins
to
describe
the
very
hostile
public
reaction,
the
city
council
meeting
to
this
proposal
and
the
sixth
paragraph,
that
accurately
reports
that
a
number
of
people
at
the
meeting
accurately
characterized
--
i
mean
a
number
of
people
has
just
been
actually
--
excuse
me,
the
article
accurately
reports
that
a
number
of
people
at
the
meeting
characterized
this
proposal
as
an
attempt
to
blackmail
the
city.
the
--
looking
on
the
sixth
paragraph,
it
says,
it
seems
that
this
is
a
slight
case
of
blackmail
commented
mrs.
marjorie
bergemann
and
the
word
was
echoed
by
many
speakers
from
the
audience.
immediately
after
that
reference
to
mrs.
bergemann,
a
city
councilman
was
quoted
as
saying
that
it's
not
blackmail.
he
preferred
to
call
it
just
two-way
negotiations
and
the
article
goes
on
and
lists
other
criticisms
of
the
thing
and
the
following
comment
demonstrates
exactly
what
the
people
at
the
council
meeting
objected
to.
he
said,
“everybody
knows
there
is
a
need
for
a
school.”
the
developer
knows
there
is
a
need
and
says,
“we'll
meet
your
need
if
you
meet
our
need.”
that's
what
the
people
were
referring
to
when
they
were
referring
to
this
article
as
blackmail.
the
second
article
is
much
the
same
thing.
it's
the
report
of
a
second
city
council
meeting
and
at
which
there
was
further
debate
on
the
same
proposal
and
the
city
council
finally
voted
four
to
one
to
reject
that.
in
that
article,
another
participant
is
quoted
the
same,
“fight
bresler's
blackmail”
in
an
attempt
to
tell
the
city
to
vote
the
proposal
down.
right
after
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
would
be
on
page
two,
16.
and
right
after
that,
another
participant
debate
is
quoted
as
saying
that,
“this
isn't
blackmail
but
the
legitimate
advance
in
mr.
bresler's
right
to
advance
his
rights
to
develop
his
land.”
now,
the
decision
below
rests
on
the
proposition,
the
incredible
proposition
i
believe
that
these
articles
charged
bresler
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
and
the
petitioners
knew
they
were
charging
him
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
anybody
interpreted
this
article
as
charged
in
a
crime
of
blackmail.
bresler
could
identify
no
one
who
read
the
articles
that
way.
he
couldn't
explain
why
he
himself
claimed
that
they
charged
him
with
a
crime
of
blackmail.
he
couldn't
explain
what
conduct
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
charged
with
that
would
constitute
the
crime
of
blackmail.
nor
was
he
able
to
explain
why
he
ignored
the
articles
for
nine
months
until
he
brought
this
$2
million
libel
suit
at
a
time
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
campaign
for
state
comptroller
and
the
news
review
was
accurately
criticizing
his
disregard
of
certain
land
covenants
and
his
misrepresentations
to
the
city
council
in
connection
therewith
that
--
on
another
matter.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
the
--
for
the
reason
stated
on
my
brief,
the
instructions
permitted
the
jury
to
allow
recovery
if
they
found
that
this
was
an
intemperate
or
excessive
statement
and
it
was
motivated
by
a
sense
of
spite
or
hostility.
that
report
so
i
don't
think
the
jury
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
libel,
this
was
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
that
you
could
find
that
a
--
on
the
maryland
rule
of
fair
comment.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
they
first
had
to
find
that
a
libelous
statement
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
think
so
under
the
instructions
that
were
given.
the
instructions
were
rather
lengthy
and
somewhat
confusing
but
i
think
the
jury
could
very
well
have
found
from
the
instructions
given
that
the
defendant
could
recover
if
they
found
that
a
statement
was
solely
intemperate
or
excessive
as
to
indicate
that
it
was
other
--could
only
have
been
activated
by
actual
malice.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
under
the
instructions
of
the
court,
it
had
to
find
a
libelous
statement.
however,
when
you
read
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
my
point
is
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
here.
if
you
read
the
articles,
anybody
who
reads
the
articles
to
that
point
is
--
it
is
clear
to
them
what
conduct
is
involved
here
and
that
that
conduct
has
no
relationship
to
the
crime
of
blackmail.
if
the
jury
found
that,
and
i
don't
believe
they
did
under
the
instructions.
if
the
jury
found
that,
my
position
here
is
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
from
which
they
could
make
that
judgment.
moreover
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioners
intended
this
strained
meeting.
the
only
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
court
was
petitioner's
testimony
that
the
word
blackmail
in
another
context
could
charge
the
commission
of
a
crime.
and
that
there
was
nothing
at
the
meeting
which
indicated
that
bresler
committed
the
crime
of
blackmail.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
on
that
testimony
alone
which
assumed
that
the
petitioners
intended
to
charge
a
crime
didn't
--
there
was
no
evidence,
they
just
assumed
that,
that
it
would
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
case
in
which
there
was
more
convincing
evidence
that
appellants
had
knowledge
of
a
falsity
of
the
charge
or
in
fact
entertain
serious
doubts.
this
holding
i
submit
is
nothing
less
than
a
mockery
of
the
new
york
times
role.
you
can't
establish
falsity
much
less
knowing
falsity
by
taking
a
word
out
of
context
and
ascribing
to
a
meaning
--
ascribing
to
it
a
meaning
that
is
wholly
different
from
that
which
it
cont
--
it's
context
dictates.
no
one
i
submit
reasonably
can
conclude
from
this
article
that
the
petitioners
intended
to
charge
mr.
bresler
with
the
crime
of
blackmail
which
was
defined
to
the
jury
in
the
court's
instructions
is
the
extortion
of
money
by
threats
of
criminal
prosecution
or
embarrassment,
threats
of
disclosure.
the
article
by
making
it
clear
what
conduct
that
bresler
was
being
criticized,
what
that
conduct
was,
that
it
was
publicly
made,
a
proposal
publicly
made
in
the
city
completely
negates
any
reasonable
finding
that
the
crime
of
blackmail
was
charged
or
that
the
petitioners
intended
the
crime
--
the
charge
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
exactly
right
and
the
use
of
the
word
blackmail
to
characterize
that
is
no
more
stronger
and
temperate
than
you
see
everyday
in
major
metropolitan
newspapers,
responsible
newspapers.
i
have
collected
those
articles
in
appendix
8
of
our
brief
and
you'll
see
that
both
the
post
and
the
star
reported
channing
phillips
characterization
of
congressman
natcher's
delaying
the
subway
funds
on
the
construction
of
the
three
sisters
bridge
is
blackmail.
the
post
characterized
editorially.
senator
fulbright's
attempt
to
force
a
change
in
vietnam
policy
by
stalling
legislation
is
nothing
less
than
blackmail.
these
strong
expressions
are
the
essence
of
spirited
debate.
they're
the
essence
of
the
robust
uninhibited
wide
open
debate
that
this
court
has
sought
to
protect
in
the
sullivan
case
and
all
the
cases
that
have
burrowed
from
it.
if
the
press
must
run
the
risk
that
they
will
be
taken
out
of
context
and
given
an
ominous
meaning
to
support
substantial
libel
judgments,
then
debate
will
clearly
be
inhibited.
i
think
the
respondent
recognizes
the
weakness
of
this
central
holding
of
the
court
by
attempting
to
shift
the
focus
to
other
articles
that
were
in
issue.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
$5,000.00
compensatory
damages
and
$12,000
by
--
$12,500.00
punitive
damages
which
had
a
far
greater
impact
on
this
small
paper
than
the
$500,000.00
judgments
against
the
new
york
times
in
the
sullivan
case.
as
i
say,
respondent
focused
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
excuse
me.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
--
well,
of
course
the
jury
verdict
does
not
make
that
clear.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
they
were
given
the
standard
instructions
on
punitive
damages
that
if
they
found
that
the
defendant's
acted
with
spite
or
hostility
that
they
would
--
to
be
allowed
to
recover
punitive
damages.
the
only
other
article
and
issue
which
the
court
relies
on
the
support
of
this
verdict
is
an
article
entitled
charles
bresler
to
run
for
state
comptroller
and
it
listed
on
the
eve
of
his
announcement
as
a
candidate
for
state
comptroller,
lists
his
dealings
in
the
community
and
there's
a
statement
in
there
that
a
number
of
homeowners
had
started
legal
proceedings
against
him
for
failure
to
make
construction
corrections
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
now,
the
basis
for
this
article
was
clearly
set
forth
in
the
record.
15
to
20
homeowners
at
a
public
meeting
told
the
news
review's
reporter
after
a
public
meeting,
told
the
news
review
reporter
that
they
had
gone
to
their
lawyers
and
they
had
filed
complaints
with
county
officials
regarding
their
homes
which
the
reporter
interpreted
as
starting
legal
proceedings.
many
of
these
people
were
personally
known
to
the
reporter,
mrs.
skolnick
or
they
--
she
recognized
them
as
residents
of
the
community.
she'd
has
also
previously
heard
similar
complaints
from
other
people
in
the
developments.
all
of
the
homeowners
with
whom
she
talked
identified
bresler
as
the
builder
that
--
with
whom
they
were
dealing.
bresler
himself
conceded
that
he'd
received
a
number
of
complaints
and
that
he
responded
to
those
complaints.
moreover,
it
subsequently
turned
out
that
one
suit
had
been
filed
and
two
suits
were
subsequently
filed,
they
got
three
suits
were
subsequently
filed
against
corporations
in
which
he
was
a
principal.
now,
the
claim
of
falsity
here
is
very
narrow.
the
claim
of
falsity
is
that
by
saying
started
legal
proceedings
is
--
that
statement
is
false
because
no
suit
had
been
filed
against
him
personally.
now,
the
gist
of
the
article
of
course
that
a
number
of
homeowners,
substantial
number
of
homeowners
in
the
community
were
complaining
about
defects
in
his
homes,
that
was
true.
the
trial
court
paid
little
attention
to
this
article.
he
mentioned
in
his
--
in
denying
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
that
this
article
didn't
bother
him.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
that
the
failure
by
the
reporter
to
check
court
records
or
to
call
bresler
before
reporting
this
information
was
sufficient
evidence
to
constitute
a
fining
of
recklessness.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
information
that
the
court
said
that
mrs.
skolnick
should
have
checked
the
court
records
to
determine
whether
lawsuits
had
actually
been
filed
against
bresler
personally,
and
this
finding
is
completely
at
odds
with
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
garrison
and
st.
amant
that
there
must
be
some
evidence
that
the
publisher
was
aware
of
a
possible
inaccuracy
or
probable
inaccuracy
in
this
article.
there's
no
finding
or
evidence
here
that
petitioners
had
any
doubt
as
to
the
accuracy
of
this
report.
since
they
have
gotten
their
information
from
a
number
of
homeowners
who
were
apparently
responsible
and
who
presumably
were
speaking
from
firsthand
knowledge
and
who
had
in
fact
complained
to
bresler
and
in
fact
gone
to
their
lawyers,
they
had
not
reason
to
doubt
their
--
this
information
or
to
investigate
further.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
bresler
was
a
part
owner
and
at
the
trial,
he
denied
that
at
this
point
in
time
he
was
active
in
the
corporation.
however,
a
contemporaneous
affidavit
which
he
filed
in
another
case,
completely
unrelated
case,
filed
right
at
the
same
time
said
he
was
the
vice
president
of
the
corporation
in
charge
of
all
sales
and
the
critical
thing
from
the
standpoint
of
the
reporter's
was
that
bresler
was
the
one
who
dealt
with
all
of
the
complaining
homeowners,
homeowners
naturally
personalize
the
builder.
they
don't
think
it's
x
corporation
or
y
corporation.
they
think
about
it
in
terms
of
zeckendorf
or
yonas
or
whoever
the
builder
happens
to
be,
they
tend
to
personalize
this
and
they
were
talking
about
bresler
and
bresler
was
the
one
who
responded
to
their
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
what?
they
were
saying
that
he
had
failed
to
make
corrections
in
their
homes
in
accordance
with
county
standards.
there
was
--
were
claiming
that
he
had
failed
to
correct
deficiencies
in
their
homes,
that
his
development
built.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
deficiencies
in
the
homes.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
they
were
equating
him
with
the
company
and
the
developer.
he
was
the
--
to
them,
bresler
was
the
builder.
he
was
the
one
that
acted
for
the
builders,
it
as
his
corporation
that
was
failing
to
perform.
so
they
were
equating
bresler
with
his
corporation.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
a
failing
to
make
corrections
to
bring
their
houses
up
to
snuff.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
all.
now,
the
court
responding
to
mr.
justice
white's
observation
start,
i
do
claim
that
the
instructions
here
are
clearly
wrong.
throughout
the
instructions,
the
court
repeatedly
instructed
that
the
defendants
could
recover,
i
mean
the
plaintiff
could
recover
if
he
showed
actual
malice
which
was
defined
as
spite,
hostility
or
deliberate
intention
to
harm.
now
the
clause
of
the
--
his
instructions,
the
court
did
give
an
instruction,
an
incomplete
instruction
on
the
new
york
times
rule,
but
he
failed
to
instruct
the
court
that
spite,
hostility
and
ill
will
as
he
had
repeatedly
defined
it
before
was
not
sufficient
to
permit
recovery.
also
the
court
refused
to
rule
out
near
negligence
as
a
proof
of
references.
i
don't
emphasize
here
these
erroneous
instructions
because
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
three
articles
upon
which
the
court
relied,
are
clearly
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
permit
recovery
under
the
new
york
times
rule.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
you
could
not
but
you
could
be
--
you
could
not
recover
and
that
our
position
also
is
that
this
unfounded
litigation
as
such
--
been
such
a
strain
on
this
small
newspaper
that
if
we
--
if
you
simply
reverse
on
the
basis
of
the
instructions
which
are
clearly
erroneous
as
there
will
be
a
denial
of
the
first
amendment
protection.
therefore
i
ask
the
court
to
review
the
record
and
determine
that
it
does
not
contain
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
verdict
under
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
comment
briefly
on
justice
white's
question
about
the
instructions.
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
instructions,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
trial
court
singled
out
only
the
blackmail
article.
in
fact,
he
referred
to
it
three
times
in
his
instructions
and
did
not
refer
to
any
of
the
other
articles
which
the
only
other
article
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
except
generally,
the
only
other
article
that
he
relied
on
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
think
that
you
--
from
the
--
reading
the
instructions
though,
you
will
see
that
the
focus
of
the
case,
and
so
only
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
on
the
term
blackmail
and
that
was
the
--
you
get
that
clearly
from
reading
the
joint
extract,
you
get
that
clearly
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
your
honor
except
that
there's
only
one
other
article
in
issue
about
which
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
factually
inaccurate.
not
just
one
about
the
homeowners'
proceedings
which
is
just
a
really
piddling
inaccuracy
when
you
take
it
against
the
fact
that
they
knew
in
the
way
they
reported
it.
this
reference
in
the
instructions
to
the
blackmail
i
think
is
helpful
in
answering
the
question,
the
point
that
you
made
mr.
justice
brennan
about
the
explicit
references
to
new
york
times
at
the
end
of
this
--
at
the
end
of
the
court's
instructions.
the
court
instructed
that
the
jury
that
--
going
to
the
factor
of
truth,
there
was
no
contention
in
this
case.
it
is
conceded
by
the
defendants
that
these
allegations
were
not
true,
that
bresler
committed
the
crime
of
blackmail,
that
bresler
was
guilty
of
blackmail.
so
in
the
background
of
that
reference
when
the
court
after
it
instructed
the
jury
that
malices,
ill
wills,
spite
or
hostility
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
the
second
is
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
it
is
essentially
right
as
the
judge
instructed
after
the
lunch
break.
the
jury
hadn't
been
out.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
if
he
had
said
that,
i
think
that
would've
cured
substantially
much
of
the
error
that
had
taken
place
but
he
didn't
simply
give
the
new
york
times
instruction,
this
is
why
i
get
back
to
this,
a
bit
about
we
conceded
that
the
allegations
of
blackmail
were
false
because
when
he
gets
into
the
new
york
times
instruction
at
the
end,
he
prefaces
his
comment
with,
there
is
no
contention
here
that
the
statements
regarding
blackmail
were
true.
so
he's
really
instructing
the
jury
that
we
had
conceded
the
statements
were
false,
that
meets
the
new
york
times
--
would
meet
the
new
york
times,
does
in
effect
--
underwrites
the
instruction
completely.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
it
--
the
fact
that
we
did
not
contend
that
the
articles
were
true
meant
that
we
conceded
that
this
is
what
the
instruction
--
that
we
conceded
that
they
can
--
that
the
allegations
were
false.
now,
we
if
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
but
if
we
concede,
yes,
that's
exactly
right
and
that's
what
the
court,
led
--
i
believe
led
the
jury
to
believe
that
we
had
conceded
that
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right,
and
then
he
further
instructed
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
charged
a
crime.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
charged
a
crime.
and
then
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
but
then
he
gives
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
he
gives
them
the
further
instruction
that
we
conceded
that,
that
we
conceded
that
the
allegations
were
not
true,
that
bresler
was
guilty
of
blackmail.
so
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
i
don't
concede
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
would
concede
that,
but
i
wouldn't
concede
that
the
allegations
in
the
article
are
false
and
i
think
that
was
misleading
to
the
jury.
what's
lacking
here
obviously
is
an
instruction,
that
clear
instruction
that
the
defendant,
that
the
defendants
not
only
charged
this
but
that
they
knew
they
were
charging,
that
they
intended
to
charge
this
strained
and
really
ludicrous
meaning
that
they
knew
it,
they
knew
it
was
false.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
yes,
i
certainly
would
still
be
here
because
i
don't
think
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
allow
a
jury
to
make
that
finding.
i
think
for
a
jury
to
find
that
this
article
charge
was
the
crime
of
blackmail
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
think
that's
very
clear
that
this
is
the
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
he
is
a
public
figure.
not
only
did
he
concede
that
he
was
a
public
figure
but
there
was
previous
widespread
publicity
in
the
washington
post
and
other
metropolitan
papers
about
his
--
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
his
duties.
there
are
vast
private
developments
planned
in
25-year-old
community
lauding
mr.
bresler's
activities
and
the
scope
and
magnitude
of
those
activities.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no,
in
fact
his
counsel
conceded
it
in
his
opening
statement
and
the
articles
went
to
--
the
blackmail
articles
went
to
a
public
issue
that
he
raised
the
issue
with
the
city
council
by
making
a
proposal
to
it.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
think
the
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
substance
but
i
don't
think
they
were
looking
to
the
fact
that
his
public
official
capacity
only
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that's
right
and
i
think
that
the
citizens
of
greenbelt
had
as
much
interest
in
this
zoning
proposal
which
affected
how
a
large
proportions
of
their
community
was
going
to
be
developed
as
much
interest
certainly
as
the
general
public
had
in
wally
butts'
college
football
experience.
the
only
other
reference
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
preference
to
--
by
the
--
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
conceded
the
statements
were
false
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
a
very
lengthy
and
confused
instruction
that
you
could
recover
on
other
basis.
the
other
thing
quickly
is
the
skullduggery
comment.
the
skullduggery
comment
is
a
rather
a
novel
theory.
there
is
no
--
it
doesn't
refer
to
bresler.
there's
no
indication
that
the
--
it
--
the
condensation
of
the
skullduggery
word,
the
condensation
was
inaccurate.
there's
no
indication
of
the
underlying
comments
were
inaccurate.
all
it
was,
was
criticism
of
the
school
board
in
delaying
the
condemnation
actually
but
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
think
it's
certainly
a
very
serious
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
would
have
to
say
no.
certainly
when
it's
directed
to
a
public
body,
an
impersonal
reference
to
an
official
action
by
a
public
body
as
we
had
in
the
rosenblatt
case,
i
would
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
well,
i
don't
have
to
--
mr.
roger
a.
clark
i
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
because
they
didn't
charge
a
private
citizen,
they
charged
the
school
board.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
in
the
context
of
what
was
involved,
in
other
words,
the
postponement
of
a
condemnation
action
by
an
official
governmental
body,
i
don't
believe
that
that
arises
to
be
stature
of
a
libelous
statement
under
the
constitution.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
that
certainly
is
my
point
and
also
there
is
just
no
showing
it's
false.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
no
attempt
to
make
that.
mr.
roger
a.
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
