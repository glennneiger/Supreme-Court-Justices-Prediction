justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
amsterdam,
do
you
--
are
you
saying
also
that
no
one
could
possibly
know
from
the
statute
that
sitting
down
and
blocking
a
sidewalk
was
covered
by
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
part
of
your
vagueness
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
i'm
disturbing
anybody
who
wants
to
use
the
sidewalk
if
i
block
the
sidewalk
completely?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
that
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
wouldn't
you
have
notice
that
--
sitting
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
blocking
the
passage
would
disturb
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
you
have
far
more
to
your
case
than
just
saying
that
sitting
down
on
the
sidewalk
isn't
covered
by
the
statute
because
even
if
it
is,
well,
you
still
have
a
lot
of
your
case
left,
because
it
covers
a
lot
of
other
things
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
they
had
any
chance
at
all
to
get
up
before
they
were
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
then,
surely
the
statute
and
the
instructions
to
the
jury
would
permit
the
convictions
for
saying
anything
that
disturbs
someone?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
instructions
specifically
permitted
the
jury
to
convict
on
that
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
there's
any
evidence
in
the
case
on
which
imaginably
or
rationally,
the
jury
could
have
convicted
for
saying
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
you
mean
that
time
they,
you
mean
at
time
they
were
arrested
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
weren't
these
petitioners
among
those
who
had
been
carrying
signs?
justice
byron
r.
white
weren't
they
carrying
handbills
inside
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wanted
to
display
their
posters,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
anybody
could
rightfully
infer
that
the
jury
might
have
convicted
these
petitioners
for
what
they
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
was,
let's
assume
there
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
something
in
this
record
from
which
it
could
be
inferred
that,
it
could
be
rationally
--
that
the
jury
could
rationally
convict
them
for
speaking,
and
the
instructions
authorized
them
to
do
so.
and
we
don't
know
on
what
basis
they
convicted
them,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
these
petitioners
have
been
carrying
a
sign
at
the
time
they
were
arrested
or
had
the
signs
in
their
hands
at
the
time
they
were
arrested,
and
the
jury
might
have
convicted
them
for
speaking
in
a
way
that
disturbed
people,
what
would
you
think
about
their
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
we
know
that
there
it
was
a
general
verdict
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
amsterdam,
do
you
--
are

that
no

that's

you
don't

i'm
disturbing
anybody
who
wants
to
use
the

if
i
block
the
sidewalk
completely?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
that
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
wouldn't
you
have
notice
that
--
sitting
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
blocking
the
passage
would
disturb
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
you
have
far
more
to
your
case
than
just
saying
that
sitting
down
on
the
sidewalk
isn't
covered
by
the
statute
because
even
if
it
is,
well,
you
still

and
the

specifically
permitted
the

justice

now,
if
there's
any
evidence
in
the
case
on
which
imaginably
or
rationally,
the
jury
could
have
convicted
for
saying
something
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
you
mean
that
time
they,
you
mean
at
time
they
were
arrested
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
weren't
these
petitioners
among
those
who
had
been

justice
byron

weren't

justice
byron
r.
white
they
wanted
to
display
their

aren't
they?
justice
byron

white
and
then
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
anybody
could
rightfully
infer
that
the
jury
might
have
convicted
these

justice
byron

let's
assume
there
was,
let's

there
was
something
in
this

from

that
the

could

convict

and
we
don't
know
on
what
basis
they
convicted
them,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
these
petitioners
have
been
carrying
a
sign
at
the
time
they
were
arrested
or
had
the

in

at

and
the

might
have

in
a

what
would
you
think
about
their
convictions?
justice
byron

i
know
but
--
justice
byron

white
if
you
can

justice

now,
how
do
we
know
that
there
it
was
a
general
verdict
here?
