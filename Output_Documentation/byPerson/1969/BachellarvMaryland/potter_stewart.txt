justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
do,
mr.
amsterdam,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
the
distinct
categories
into
which
you
put
your
three
issues
in
increasing
breadths.
you
said
the
last
one
was
whether
the
statute
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional
as
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
you
mean
--
does
this
have
to
do
with
vagueness
or
breadth,
over
breadth
or
vagueness
or
does
it
have
to
do
with
what
the
statute
explicitly
prohibits
and
makes
an
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
think
the
statute
covers
the
conduct
in
the
recruiting
office
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
looking
at
the
statute.
it
talks
about
any
public
street
or
highway
and
various
other
places
and
it
says
or
in
any
elevator,
lobby,
or
corridor
of
any
office
building
that
would
not
in
your
submission
include
the
recruiting
office?
justice
potter
stewart
an
office
building,
if
it's
a
building
with
an
office
in
it,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there
were
25
or
30
other
people
who
had
been
picketing
on
the
street
for
fairly
long
period
of
time
while
your
clients
were
in
the
office,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
at
closing
time?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
still
the
law
in
maryland,
mr.
amsterdam,
that
–-
rather
peculiar
law
in
maryland
that
the
jury
is
the
judge
both
with
the
facts
and
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
relevance
here
are
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
wonder
in
the
case,
and
i
think
perhaps
the
unique
situation
of
maryland
where
the
jury
is
made
the
judge
of
both
facts
and
the
law,
whether
our
decisions
of
coming
from
other
jurisdictions,
where
that
is
far
from
true,
are
completely
relevant.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
separate
one
as
i
understand
it,
making
an
offense
to
obstruct
the
street
or
sidewalk?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lentz,
i
beg
your
pardon.
