mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
state
disorderly
conduct
prosecution
brings
to
the
court
three
issues
of
greatly
varying
breadth.
the
narrowest
relates
simply
to
the
jury
instructions
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
is
whether
on
this
record
and
in
light
of
the
trial
court's
charge
defining
the
offensive
disorderly
conduct.
the
court's
failure
to
give
certain
instruction
requested
by
the
petitioner
caused
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
on
a
constitutionally
impermissible
basis.
the
second
and
broader
question
is
whether
on
this
record,
the
conviction
of
these
petitioners
under
the
specific
definition
of
disorderly
conduct
charged
to
the
jury
violates
the
first
amendment
or
in
other
words,
whether
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
has
been
unconstitutionally
applied.
and
the
third
question
is
whether
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
by
virtue
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
all
three
of
these
questions
have
in
common,
the
language
of
the
offense
of
disorderly
conduct
in
maryland,
resolution
of
any
of
them
requires
careful
attention
to
that
language
and
i
would
like
to
start
with
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
has
to
do
with
the
particularized
standards
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
applicable
in
the
first
amendment
area.
so,
when
i
say
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
i
mean
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
the
same
sense
in
which
this
court
has
looked
to
the
facial
validity
of
statutes
when
applied
in
areas
involving
speech.
i
am
talking
about
a
first
amendment
contention,
but
it's
not
unrelated
to
the
general
doctrines
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth.
there's
a
more
particularized
doctrine
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
applicable
in
the
first
amendment
area.
it
is
that
which
we
invoke.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now,
it
is
not
unusual
that
in
the
disorderly
conduct
area,
the
statute
itself
does
not
contain
the
exhaustive
definition
of
the
crime.
the
statute
is
found
on
page
4
of
our
brief
and
it
simply
says,
“every
person
who
shall
be
found
acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
a
public
peace
upon
any
street
or
highway
or
in
other
public
places
is
guilty
of
the
offense.”
however,
the
statute
has
been
authoritatively
construed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
at
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
we
both
state
those
constructions
and
set
forth
the
portions
of
the
specific
jury
charge
in
this
case
which
embody
the
maryland
doctrines
of
disorderly
conduct.
and
there
are
two
distinct
theories
of
disorderly
conduct
in
maryland.
the
first
as
charged
to
petitioner's
jury
is,
disorderly
conduct
is
the
doing
or
saying,
or
both,
of
that
which
offends,
disturbs,
incites,
or
tends
to
incite
a
number
of
people
gathered
in
the
same
area.
it
is
conduct
of
such
nature
as
to
affect
the
peace
and
quiet
of
persons
who
may
witness
it
and
who
maybe
disturbed
or
provoked
to
resentment
because
of
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
it
is
unclear.
again,
it's
of
the
nature
of
definitions
of
this
sort
that
they
don't
make
those
linkages
clear.
the
--
the
verbal
terminology
is--conduct
of
such
nature
as
to
affect
the
peace
and
quiet.
now,
i
take
it
there's
a
relationship
between
that
and
inciting
and
disturbing,
but
the
verbal
mix
is
not
direct.
the
second
--
for
sure,
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
to
call
that
the
disturbing
of
public
theory
of
disorderly
conduct
and
i
refer
to
it
as
that.
the
second
is
that,
disobeying
a
police
order
theory
of
disorderly
conduct
and
that
which
charged
the
petitioner's
jury
as
follows,
“a
refusal
to
obey
a
policemen's
command
to
move
on
when
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace.”
it
may
amount
to
disorderly
conduct.
now,
having
focused
in
on
the
language,
i
would
propose
very,
very
briefly
to
describe
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
them.
i
only
want
to
touch
the
highlights
in
that
brief
briefly.
the
case
arises
of
course
out
of
an
antiwar
demonstration
in
front
of
a
recruiting
center.
there
were
pickets
in
front
of
the
recruiting
center,
marching
in
a
line.
they
had
signs
and
placards.
the
petitioners
here
were
part
of
the
picket
line.
they
joined
that
picket
line
and
they
marched
with
the
placards
in
the
line.
they
then
went
into
--
actually
three
of
them,
i
don't
regard
this
as
material,
three
of
the
six
went
in
to
the
recruiting
office
and
asked
the
sergeant
in
charge
to
display
their
antiwar
literature
which
he
said,
he
had
no
authority
to
do
and
declined
to
do
and
explaining
that
to
the
mass
on
the
lead.
they
did
not
--
they
remained
and
argued
with
him
for
a
while
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
remove
them
for
the
office
until
closing
time,
something
more
than
an
hour
later.
at
that
time,
the
lines
were
drawn
down,
and
after
they
were
asked
again
to
leave
both
by
the
recruiting
sergeant
and
the
united
states
marshall
and
they
declined
to
do
so,
they
were
removed.
now
at
this
point,
the
testimony
begins
to
diverge
in
as
many
directions
as
there
are
witness.
they
say
they
were
taken
out
thrown
bodily
on
the
ground
in
a
violent
way.
the
officer
has
testified
that
they
were
put
outside.
some
of
the
officers
admit
putting
them
down
of
their
backs.
others
say
at
least
one
landed
on
his
feet,
some
say
they
were
escorted
out.
a
photographer
present
says
they
were
all
carried
out
very
close
to
the
ground
and
dropped
on
their
rears,
but
in
any
event,
they
ended
up
on
the
ground
outside.
they
may
have
sat
down
and
they
may
have
been
dropped.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
it
absolutely
--
it
does
indeed
your
honor.
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
we
were
just
claiming
that
the
petitioner's
conduct
was
not
constitutionally
punishable,
we
would
accept
the
findings
of
fact
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution.
i
would
have
stated
this
case
entirely
in
terms
of
the
prosecution's
testimony.
but
one
of
the
major
issues
is,
what
instructions
should
have
been
given
to
the
jury.
now,
of
course
it
is
the
function
of
instructions
to
the
jury
to
have
them
decide
on
the
facts
of
the
whole
record
which
category,
a
prosecution
verdict
or
a
defense
verdict
the
case
falls
in.
so
of
course,
defense
evidence
is
relevant
and
conflicts
of
the
evidence
are
irrelevant
on
the
question
what
instruction
should
have
been
given
to
the
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
that
is
one
of
three
contentions
and
at
the
moment,
i
am
not
addressing
my
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
excuse
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
have
no
relevance
whatever
if
they
were
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
in
the
recruiting
center.
they
were
not.
that
is
very
plain.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
disorderly
conduct
except
on
a
public
street
and
in
certain
places
which
does
not
include
a
recruiting
officer.
at
the
close
of
the
case,
the
trial
judge
formally
announced
that
nothing
that
they
had
done
in
the
recruiting
office
was
the
basis
of
this
charge.
whatever
they
may
have
done
in
there,
the
scene
and
if
that's
what
it
was
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
conviction
of
disorderly
conduct.
that
has
been
plain
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
i
am
not
arguing
for
one
moment
that
the
court
below
could
not
take
account
in
determining
whether
what
they
were
charged
with
was
disorderly
conduct
as
its
conduct
on
the
street
with
their
conduct
before
they
went
in
and
while
they
went
in
and
after
they
came
out.
that
is
no
--
that's
exactly
why
i'm
describing
these
facts.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
interior
of
a
business
office
is
not
an
elevator,
lobby
or
corridor
of
an
office
building.
this
is
a
storefront
office.
this
is
not
a
public
building
with
public
cars.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
but
this
requires
that
it
be
the
elevator,
lobby
or
corridor
of
an
office
building.
and
what
we
have
simply
is
a
storefront,
all
of
the
space
within
which
is
working
space.
this
is
an
office.
it
is
not
public
space
in
an
office
building.
in
any
event,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart,
simply
refer
your
honor
to
the
view
the
trial
took
of
this
case.
i
think
it
is
quite
important.
if
you
look
at
our
brief
at
page
25
in
the
run
over
footnote,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony,
the
trial
court
declared
that
the
offense
of
disorderly
conduct
with
which
they
are
charged
does
not
relate
to
anything
that
took
place
inside
the
office.
now,
this
was
in
connection
with
a
defense
request
to
charge
to
that
effect.
the
project
said
he
would
charge
to
that
effect.
he
did
in
fact
neglect
the
charge
to
that
effect.
but
that's
not
the
claim
we
bear
at
this
point.
we
raised
that
claim
below
that
he
should've
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
but
his
ruling
is
quite
plain.
he
didn't
think
that
anything
that
went
on
inside
the
office
was
part
of
the
offense.
indeed,
the
chief
justice's
point
came
up
at
the
trial.
it
is
whether
we
took
the
position
that
what
went
on
inside
the
office
was
totally
immaterial.
defendant's
trial
counsel
did
take
that
position
and
answer
the
testimony
be
strict
and
i
do
not,
at
this
point
take
that
position.
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
relevant
background.
the
court
rejected
that
position.
but
the
court
rejected
it
specifically
on
the
ground
that
this
was
relevant
background
and
not
that
the
conduct
inside
the
office
was
disorderly.
and
in
fact,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
trial
record,
you
will
see
that
the
prosecution
hurried
through
the
testimony
as
to
what
went
on
in
the
office.
that
testimony
is
quite
unclear.
there
was
no
cross
examination
on
it
by
defense
counsel
precisely
because
these
events
separately
were
not
and
everybody
realized
they
were
not.
at
trial,
what
the
basis
of
the
charge
was.
the
charge
had
to
do
with
what
happened
on
the
street.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct.
both
before
and
after
the
picketers
included
the
six
defendant's
petitioners
here.
and
then
when
they
went
in
they
were
in,
remember
for
about
an
hour.
picketing
continued
and
indeed,
from
what
it
appears,
the
petitioners
were
in
and
out
and
other
people
were
in
and
out.
the
six
petitioners
end
up
here
because
they
were
lashed
in
the
office
at
five.
they
were
the
ones
who
had
stayed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
then
they
were
thrown
out.
now,
the
point
is,
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
us
be
clear
in
timing
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
responding
to
that
question.
i
was
talking
about
the
picketing.
the
picketing
had
seized
by
the
time
of
exhibit
9.
exhibit
9
refers
to
the
time
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
six
petitioners
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
office
and
were
on
the
sidewalk,
in
front
of
it.
at
that
point,
a
crowd
composed
of
the
other
demonstrators
--
that
is
the
picketers
and
onlookers,
gathered
around
to
watch.
it
is
unclear
on
the
record,
whether
or
not
that
crowd
of
onlookers
was
already
obstructing
the
sidewalk
in
the
way
in
which
you
see
at
9:00
before
they
were
thrown
out,
or
whether
that
happened
when
they
were
thrown
out.
that
is
not
a
picket
line,
your
honor,
that
is
a
crowd
that
is
watching.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
certainly
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
are
at
that
point
depending
on
the
view
one
takes
to
the
testimony
which
was
never
resolved
by
the
jury.
either
still
engaged
in
a
demonstration
were
lying
on
the
ground
where
they
were
thrown
because
they
haven't
yet
a
change
to
pick
themselves
up.
if
that
issue
had
been
resolved
by
the
jury,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
by
any
means.
certainly
not
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
and
in
any
event
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
unless
the
public
responds
--
well,
i
better
not
go
that
far.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
that
so.
let
me
take
the
statute
apart
and
see.
in
one
sense
response
is
necessary.
that
is,
under
the
definition
of
disorderly
conduct
which
involves
doing
something
which
offends,
disturbs
or
incites,
the
reaction
of
the
crowd
is
relevant.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
whether
it
tends
to
incite
may
not
turn
the
liability
on
actual
reaction
by
the
crowd.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
did
indeed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
no
question
about
it.
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
our
position
here
which
both
the
court
below
misunderstood
and
respondent
appears
to
misunderstand.
we
are
not
contending
that
these
petitioners
were
arrested
because
the
police
disagreed
with
their
views,
they
were
not.
we
don't
suggest
that
for
one
moment.
what
we
suggest
is
two
things.
first
of
all,
what
is
an
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
reason
for
their
arrest.
what's
involved
before
this
court
is
a
basis
for
their
conviction
and
they
were
convicted
on
the
theory
that
they
did
something
which
offended,
disturbed
or
incited.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
obstructing
the
sidewalk
or
any
basis
for
the
police
arrest.
secondly,
the
offense
disturbing
and
inciting
has
to
do
with
the
crowd's
response
to
their
ideas.
we're
not
saying
the
police
disagreed
with
their
ideas.
what
we're
saying
is
that
police
arrested
them
because
they
disturbed
the
crowd.
what
your
honor
is
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
exactly
is
right,
that
this
offense
turns
in
large
part,
if
not
exclusively
on
a
crowd's
reaction.
and
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is,
that
the
crowd
reacted
with
hostility
to
the
petitioners.
why?
not
because
of
their
position
on
the
street,
because
of
their
position
in
vietnam,
that's
plain
and
that's
plain
on
the
state's
own
testimony.
and
as
a
result
of
that
hostility,
the
police
then
proceeded
to
arrest
them
for
creating
a
disturbance.
now,
it
is
the
purpose
of
disorderly
conduct
was,
to
prevent
the
public
from
being
upset,
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
to
prevent
disorderly
conduct
laws
from
allowing
convictions
where
the
offset
is
ideological.
that
is
the
essence
of
our
submission
in
this
case.
now,
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
the
issues
presented
because
in
my
view,
the
respondent
takes
a
very
different
issue
--
very
different
view
of
the
issues
than
petitioner.
and
i
think
who
is
ultimately
right
on
the
merits
of
this
case
depends
on
large
part
if
not
exclusively
and
whose
formulation
of
the
issues
is
the
correct
one.
for
that
reason,
i
wanted
to
tell
the
court
exactly
what
i
think
the
issues
are.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
these
petitioners
had
done
something
for
which
maryland
can
constitutionally
punish.
more
specifically,
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
sit
in
on
a
recruiting
office.
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk.
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
obstruct
the
sidewalk.
i
am
not
asserting
that
they
have
any
of
those
rights.
what
they
have
a
right
to
is
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
whether
they
did
any
of
those
things
under
a
statute
which
in
terms
punishes
doing
those
things.
so
that
the
issues
submitted
to
the
jury
and
fairly
decided
by
the
jury
would
be
whether
the
petitioners
did
anything
that
maryland
had
a
constitutional
right
to
punish.
now,
that
is
not
this
trial
and
that
is
not
this
statute.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
profoundly
disagree
with
the
respondent's
statement
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
respondents
make
it
a
simple
case.
petitioners
obstructed
the
sidewalk,
they
were
told
to
move
on,
therefore
they
were
charged
with
refusing
to
move
on
after
being
told
that
this
is
so
because
they
were
obstructing
the
sidewalk
and
that's
a
perfectly
constitutional
charge.
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
the
first
time
petitioners
have
been
charged
with
that
is
in
this
court,
and
if
i
may
refer
to
the
record,
i
think
i
can
satisfy
the
court
pretty
squarely
on
that
point.
what
the
respondents
say
specifically
in
their
brief
is,
petitioners
were
arrested
for
blocking
the
sidewalk
and
for
failure
to
obey
a
policeman's
command
to
move
on,
when
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace.
an
examination
of
the
record
clearly
discloses
that
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
was
a
prevailing
factor
because
they
arrested
petitioners
not
disagreement
with
their
ideas.
i
think
i've
already
pointed
out
that
the
issue
here
is
not
what
they
were
arrested
for,
it's
what
they've
been
convicted
for.
and
at
this
point,
when
we
want
to
ask
what
they
were
convicted
for,
and
i
want
to
look
at
another
aspect
of
the
respondent's
brief.
the
respondent
point's
out
at
page
42
that
the
prosecutor
elected
not
to
proceed
under
the
maryland
statute
governing
obstruction
of
the
streets.
the
respondent
suggested
it's
immaterial
that
the
state
didn't
proceed
under
that
statute.
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
the
state
didn't
proceed
under
that
statute
is
the
essence
of
this
case
because
what
the
charge
was,
it
was
in
fact
may,
was
the
broad
general
disorderly
charge
under
section
123.
now
that
charge
as
i've
said
has
two
aspects.
doing
or
saying
or
both
of
anything
that
offends,
disturbs
or
incites.
now,
with
regard
to
that
charge,
i
want
to
point
out,
that
there's
not
only
nothing
in
it
about
obstructing
sidewalks
but
there's
nothing
in
it
about
disobeying
a
police
order.
and
this
was
put
before
the
jury
as
a
separate
ground
of
conviction,
with
all
the
facts
including
chief
justice
burger,
the
background
facts
like
the
fact
that
these
people
were
walking
with
signs
and
that
they
were
singing
“we
shall
overcome”
and
they
were
on
the
street.
now,
the
state
even
in
this
court
caused
their
singing
on
the
sidewalk,
misplaced,
vocalizing
and
suggested
that
it
was
disorderly
because
it
prevented
them
for
hearing
police
orders.
and
that's
why
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
focus
in
this
case
not
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
obstructing
a
sidewalk
or
anything
else.
certain
of
their
conduct
was
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
picketing
was
with
the
placards
and
with
the
signs
and
singing
“we
shall
overcome,”
not
all
of
it,
but
some
parts
of
it.
the
state's
charge
here
was
a
blunderbuss.
it
was
a
charge
that
they
did
offend,
disturb,
and
incite
a
crowd
of
people.
that's
the
issue
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
now,
for
the
state
then
to
abandon
that
up
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
to
say
that
that
head
of
liability
which
it
insisted
on
to
get
these
convictions
and
then
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
pardon
me,
in
the
court
of
special
appeals
stood
on
to
get
the
conviction
affirmed
is
now
to
be
abandoned,
and
this
is
to
turn
into
an
obstructing
the
sidewalk
case,
is
to
do
precisely
what
this
court
in
gregory
and
a
number
or
other
cases
has
said
cannot
be
done.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
most
certainly
am
saying
that
no
one
could
know
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
but
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
explain
why
i'm
saying
that.
a
--
as
i
read
the
statute
on
the
constructions
put
on
it
below.
i
can
sit
down
and
block
the
sidewalk
all
i
want
and
i
don't
violate
the
statute.
unless
i
offend,
disturb,
incite
or
tend
to
incite
a
number
of
people
or
disobey
a
police
order
when
not
to
move
on
may
endanger
the
public
peace,
i
have
not
violated
the
statute.
now,
if
i
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
be
disturbing
those
people
who
wants
to
use
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
the
statute
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
disturbing,
it
is
a
matter
of
acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace.
that
doesn't
simply
mean
disturbing
any
individual
from
engaging
in
his
own
pursuits.
the
notion
of
disturbing
a
public
peace
is
one
with
which
courts
have
struggled
for
a
long
time
and
this
court
witnessed
state
court
definitions
of
disturbance
of
the
peace
in
cox,
in
edwards
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
the
very
different
thing
from
simply
disturbing
somebody
who
wants
to
walk
along
the
street.
and
in
any
event,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
petitioner's
request
to
the
jury,
request
to
charge
the
jury
would
have
been
to
limit
the
statute
to
exactly
that.
we
admit
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
in
what
it
means.
i
do
think
that
one
would
not
know
that
sitting
down
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
in
any
event,
i
am
clear
on
one
thing,
that
the
jury
should
know
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
when
it
comes
time
to
try
the
case.
and
that
when
the
trial
judge
submits
the
issue
in
terms
of
generally
disturbing,
offending
and
inciting,
and
we
asked
for
instructions
that
say,
it's
only
if
you
disturb
people
by
obstructing
the
sidewalk.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
you're
guilty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
one
other
thing
i
should
respond
mr.
justice
white,
your
question
assumes
something
that
i
think
the
court
may
well
assume
when
it
comes
to
this
case
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear,
i
don't
think
it's
a
fair
assumption.
that
is
the
assumption
that
these
people
sat
on
the
sidewalk.
now,
i'm
not
as
i
said
in
the
brief,
i'm
not
going
to
be
evasive
about
that.
that
issue
was
not
fairly
tried
below
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
way
this
case
had
gone
to
jury,
the
question
presented
was
allow
the
jury
to
resolve
whether
they
did
or
didn't
sit
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
the
testimony
is
conflicting
on
that.
and
i
think
that
is
was
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
only
of
the
issues
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
for
their
resolution.
when
the
trial
court
submits
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
conduct
offended,
disturbed
or
incited
a
crowd,
to
take
the
jury's
verdict
then
settling
a
proposition
that
they
sat
on
the
sidewalk
would
be
totally
incomprehensible.
if
the
trial
court
had
said
to
the
jury,
did
they
or
did
they
not
willfully,
indeed
we
submit
an
instruction.
i
think
if
the
court
will
take
a
look
at
our
proposed
instructions.
we
submitted
instructions
at
page
15,
16,
17
which
would
have
allowed
the
definition
of
the
offense
in
exactly
those
terms.
an
alternative
instruction
i-a
had
three
heads
of
liability.
one
of
which
was
knowingly
and
purposely
engaging
in
acts
which
they
had
no
lawful
right
to
do,
which
obstructed
or
hinder
pedestrians
and
traffic.
over
on
the
next
page
16
of
the
appendix,
our
instruction
would
have
defined
in
precisely
mr.
justice
white's
terms
obstructing
traffic.
if
those
instructions
had
been
given
and
the
jury
had
voted
against
these
petitioners,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
that
wouldn't
be
this
case.
but
what
was
submitted
to
the
jury
was
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
sat
on
the
sidewalk
but
a
broader
one.
now,
there
is
one
aspect
of
the
court's
charge
that
may
seem
to
submit
that
question.
it
is
not
in
the
portion
defining
the
offense,
but
it
is
on
page
157
where
in
describing
the
defense
case,
and
i
want
to
--
taking
aside
one
moment
to
point
out
that,
the
court
summarized
the
evidence
here
as
well
as
giving
instructions
on
the
law.
when
it
summarized
the
prosecution's
case,
where
you
would
think
at
least
it
would
mention
obstruction,
if
obstruction
was
an
issue
even
though
that
was
an
illegal
element.
the
court
didn't
even
talk
about
obstruction.
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
on
the
law
nor
on
summary
even
of
the
prosecutor's
case
would
suggest
that
obstruction
was
an
issue
here.
and
therefore,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
they
sat
there,
whether
they
have
obstructed
anything
was
not
resolved
by
the
jury.
now,
the
one
quibble
that
one
might
have
with
that
is
this,
there
is
instating
the
defense
case
a
statement
that,
the
position
of
the
defense
is
that,
they
didn't
here
the
command
of
the
officers
to
get
up
and
move
on.
if
that
is
the
case,
they
had
a
right
to
sit
on
the
sidewalk
or
in
the
case
of
one
or
two
of
them
restrained
there
by
the
end
of
office.
but
notice
that
the
general
jury
charge
submits
two
theories
of
liability.
offending,
disturbing
and
inciting
is
one
and
the
other
is
refusing
to
move
on.
this
says
that
they
had
a
right
to
sit
on
the
sidewalk,
i.e.
not
to
move
on,
if
they
didn't
hear
the
instruction
of
the
officers.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
they're
guilty
or
not
guilty
under
the
first
theory.
and
it
is
perfectly
consistent
that
the
jury
in
resolving
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
found
that
although
they
did
not
willfully
sit
down,
they
were
thrown
there
by
the
officers.
although,
they
did
not
have
a
chance
to
get
up,
or
although
they
were
held
down
which
is
their
testimony
that
nevertheless
they
did
something
which
offended,
disturbed
and
incited
a
crowd
to
with
the
misplaced
vocalizing
which
the
state
now
talks
about
singing
“we
shall
overcome.”
the
total
current
text
of
that
activity
which
your
honor
really
are
suggested,
picketing
outside,
going
into
a
recruiting
office,
presenting
literature
and
then
refusing
to
leave
the
office
and
then
getting
out
on
the
street,
i
think
the
jury
in
fact
didn't
resolve
these
conflicts.
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
for
this
court
to
say
it
did.
the
jury
took
this
case
the
way
the
state
submitted.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
such
a
rule
in
maryland.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
are
supposed
to
be
merely
advisory.
but
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
held
that
a
conviction
is
reversible
if
the
advisory
instructions
are
wrong,
it
seems
very
clear
that
this
court
would
have
to
say
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
whether
the
instructions
were
wrong.
and
if
they
were
wrong,
then
the
judgment
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
court
were
disposed
to
treat
maryland
differently
than
any
other
jurisdiction
for
that
purpose,
that
maryland's
whole
law
disorderly
conduct
would
have
to
be
unconstitutional
because
what
that
would
do
would
be
to
deprive
this
court
of
imposing
legal
restrictions
on
the
formulation
of
rules
in
the
first
amendment
area.
and
that
very
deprivation
would
cause
inevitably
the
kind
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
which
this
court
has
held
bad
when
applied
to
first
amendment
conduct
if
it
really
is
true
and
i
simply
do
not
take
it
seriously,
because
frankly,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
doesn't
take
it
seriously,
that
the
jury
is
judge
to
the
fact.
for
all
ordinary
trial
purposes,
it
isn't.
counsel
can
get
up
and
argue
when
the
jury
is
told
that
they
are
in
that
sort
of
things.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
brady
and
as
the
(inaudible)
opinion
that
it
refers
to
in
brady
pointed
out,
only
ordinary
rules
of
review
are
applicable
in
maryland.
if
the
instruction
is
wrong,
the
jury
judgment
gets
reversed.
that's
all
that's
in
issue
here.
was
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
this
instruction
wrong
and
rendered
wrong
because
of
refusal
to
give
the
requested
charges,
and
if
so,
maryland
law
itself
says
that
this
judgment
has
to
be
reversed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
state
disorderly
conduct
prosecution
brings
to
the
court
three
issues
of
greatly
varying
breadth.
the
narrowest
relates
simply
to
the
jury
instructions
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
is
whether
on
this
record
and
in
light
of
the
trial
court's
charge
defining
the
offensive
disorderly
conduct.
the
court's
failure
to
give
certain
instruction
requested
by
the
petitioner
caused
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
on
a
constitutionally
impermissible
basis.
the
second
and
broader
question
is
whether
on
this
record,
the
conviction
of
these
petitioners
under
the
specific
definition
of
disorderly
conduct
charged
to
the
jury
violates
the
first
amendment
or
in
other
words,
whether
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
has
been
unconstitutionally
applied.
and
the
third
question
is
whether
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
by
virtue
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
all
three
of
these
questions
have
in
common,
the
language
of
the
offense
of
disorderly
conduct
in
maryland,
resolution
of
any
of
them
requires
careful
attention
to
that
language
and
i
would
like
to
start
with
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
has
to
do
with
the
particularized
standards
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
applicable
in
the
first
amendment
area.
so,
when
i
say
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
i
mean
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
the
same
sense
in
which
this
court
has
looked
to
the
facial
validity
of
statutes
when
applied
in
areas
involving
speech.
i
am
talking
about
a
first
amendment
contention,
but
it's
not
unrelated
to
the
general
doctrines
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth.
there's
a
more
particularized
doctrine
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
applicable
in
the
first
amendment
area.
it
is
that
which
we
invoke.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now,
it
is
not
unusual
that
in
the
disorderly
conduct
area,
the
statute
itself
does
not
contain
the
exhaustive
definition
of
the
crime.
the
statute
is
found
on
page
4
of
our
brief
and
it
simply
says,
“every
person
who
shall
be
found
acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
a
public
peace
upon
any
street
or
highway
or
in
other
public
places
is
guilty
of
the
offense.”
however,
the
statute
has
been
authoritatively
construed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
at
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
we
both
state
those
constructions
and
set
forth
the
portions
of
the
specific
jury
charge
in
this
case
which
embody
the
maryland
doctrines
of
disorderly
conduct.
and
there
are
two
distinct
theories
of
disorderly
conduct
in
maryland.
the
first
as
charged
to
petitioner's
jury
is,
disorderly
conduct
is
the
doing
or
saying,
or
both,
of
that
which
offends,
disturbs,
incites,
or
tends
to
incite
a
number
of
people
gathered
in
the
same
area.
it
is
conduct
of
such
nature
as
to
affect
the
peace
and
quiet
of
persons
who
may
witness
it
and
who
maybe
disturbed
or
provoked
to
resentment
because
of
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
it
is
unclear.
again,
it's
of
the
nature
of
definitions
of
this
sort
that
they
don't
make
those
linkages
clear.
the
--
the
verbal
terminology
is--conduct
of
such
nature
as
to
affect
the
peace
and
quiet.
now,
i
take
it
there's
a
relationship
between
that
and
inciting
and
disturbing,
but
the
verbal
mix
is
not
direct.
the
second
--
for
sure,
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
to
call
that
the
disturbing
of
public
theory
of
disorderly
conduct
and
i
refer
to
it
as
that.
the
second
is
that,
disobeying
a
police
order
theory
of
disorderly
conduct
and
that
which
charged
the
petitioner's
jury
as
follows,
“a
refusal
to
obey
a
policemen's
command
to
move
on
when
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace.”
it
may
amount
to
disorderly
conduct.
now,
having
focused
in
on
the
language,
i
would
propose
very,
very
briefly
to
describe
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
them.
i
only
want
to
touch
the
highlights
in
that
brief
briefly.
the
case
arises
of
course
out
of
an
antiwar
demonstration
in
front
of
a
recruiting
center.
there
were
pickets
in
front
of
the
recruiting
center,
marching
in
a
line.
they
had
signs
and
placards.
the
petitioners
here
were
part
of
the
picket
line.
they
joined
that
picket
line
and
they
marched
with
the
placards
in
the
line.
they
then
went
into
--
actually
three
of
them,
i
don't
regard
this
as
material,
three
of
the
six
went
in
to
the
recruiting
office
and
asked
the
sergeant
in
charge
to
display
their
antiwar
literature
which
he
said,
he
had
no
authority
to
do
and
declined
to
do
and
explaining
that
to
the
mass
on
the
lead.
they
did
not
--
they
remained
and
argued
with
him
for
a
while
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
remove
them
for
the
office
until
closing
time,
something
more
than
an
hour
later.
at
that
time,
the
lines
were
drawn
down,
and
after
they
were
asked
again
to
leave
both
by
the
recruiting
sergeant
and
the
united
states
marshall
and
they
declined
to
do
so,
they
were
removed.
now
at
this
point,
the
testimony
begins
to
diverge
in
as
many
directions
as
there
are
witness.
they
say
they
were
taken
out
thrown
bodily
on
the
ground
in
a
violent
way.
the
officer
has
testified
that
they
were
put
outside.
some
of
the
officers
admit
putting
them
down
of
their
backs.
others
say
at
least
one
landed
on
his
feet,
some
say
they
were
escorted
out.
a
photographer
present
says
they
were
all
carried
out
very
close
to
the
ground
and
dropped
on
their
rears,
but
in
any
event,
they
ended
up
on
the
ground
outside.
they
may
have
sat
down
and
they
may
have
been
dropped.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
it
absolutely
--
it
does
indeed
your
honor.
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
we
were
just
claiming
that
the
petitioner's
conduct
was
not
constitutionally
punishable,
we
would
accept
the
findings
of
fact
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution.
i
would
have
stated
this
case
entirely
in
terms
of
the
prosecution's
testimony.
but
one
of
the
major
issues
is,
what
instructions
should
have
been
given
to
the
jury.
now,
of
course
it
is
the
function
of
instructions
to
the
jury
to
have
them
decide
on
the
facts
of
the
whole
record
which
category,
a
prosecution
verdict
or
a
defense
verdict
the
case
falls
in.
so
of
course,
defense
evidence
is
relevant
and
conflicts
of
the
evidence
are
irrelevant
on
the
question
what
instruction
should
have
been
given
to
the
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
that
is
one
of
three
contentions
and
at
the
moment,
i
am
not
addressing
my
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
excuse
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
have
no
relevance
whatever
if
they
were
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
in
the
recruiting
center.
they
were
not.
that
is
very
plain.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
disorderly
conduct
except
on
a
public
street
and
in
certain
places
which
does
not
include
a
recruiting
officer.
at
the
close
of
the
case,
the
trial
judge
formally
announced
that
nothing
that
they
had
done
in
the
recruiting
office
was
the
basis
of
this
charge.
whatever
they
may
have
done
in
there,
the
scene
and
if
that's
what
it
was
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
conviction
of
disorderly
conduct.
that
has
been
plain
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
i
am
not
arguing
for
one
moment
that
the
court
below
could
not
take
account
in
determining
whether
what
they
were
charged
with
was
disorderly
conduct
as
its
conduct
on
the
street
with
their
conduct
before
they
went
in
and
while
they
went
in
and
after
they
came
out.
that
is
no
--
that's
exactly
why
i'm
describing
these
facts.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
interior
of
a
business
office
is
not
an
elevator,
lobby
or
corridor
of
an
office
building.
this
is
a
storefront
office.
this
is
not
a
public
building
with
public
cars.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
but
this
requires
that
it
be
the
elevator,
lobby
or
corridor
of
an
office
building.
and
what
we
have
simply
is
a
storefront,
all
of
the
space
within
which
is
working
space.
this
is
an
office.
it
is
not
public
space
in
an
office
building.
in
any
event,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
stewart,
simply
refer
your
honor
to
the
view
the
trial
took
of
this
case.
i
think
it
is
quite
important.
if
you
look
at
our
brief
at
page
25
in
the
run
over
footnote,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony,
the
trial
court
declared
that
the
offense
of
disorderly
conduct
with
which
they
are
charged
does
not
relate
to
anything
that
took
place
inside
the
office.
now,
this
was
in
connection
with
a
defense
request
to
charge
to
that
effect.
the
project
said
he
would
charge
to
that
effect.
he
did
in
fact
neglect
the
charge
to
that
effect.
but
that's
not
the
claim
we
bear
at
this
point.
we
raised
that
claim
below
that
he
should've
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
but
his
ruling
is
quite
plain.
he
didn't
think
that
anything
that
went
on
inside
the
office
was
part
of
the
offense.
indeed,
the
chief
justice's
point
came
up
at
the
trial.
it
is
whether
we
took
the
position
that
what
went
on
inside
the
office
was
totally
immaterial.
defendant's
trial
counsel
did
take
that
position
and
answer
the
testimony
be
strict
and
i
do
not,
at
this
point
take
that
position.
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
relevant
background.
the
court
rejected
that
position.
but
the
court
rejected
it
specifically
on
the
ground
that
this
was
relevant
background
and
not
that
the
conduct
inside
the
office
was
disorderly.
and
in
fact,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
trial
record,
you
will
see
that
the
prosecution
hurried
through
the
testimony
as
to
what
went
on
in
the
office.
that
testimony
is
quite
unclear.
there
was
no
cross
examination
on
it
by
defense
counsel
precisely
because
these
events
separately
were
not
and
everybody
realized
they
were
not.
at
trial,
what
the
basis
of
the
charge
was.
the
charge
had
to
do
with
what
happened
on
the
street.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct.
both
before
and
after
the
picketers
included
the
six
defendant's
petitioners
here.
and
then
when
they
went
in
they
were
in,
remember
for
about
an
hour.
picketing
continued
and
indeed,
from
what
it
appears,
the
petitioners
were
in
and
out
and
other
people
were
in
and
out.
the
six
petitioners
end
up
here
because
they
were
lashed
in
the
office
at
five.
they
were
the
ones
who
had
stayed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
then
they
were
thrown
out.
now,
the
point
is,
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
us
be
clear
in
timing
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
responding
to
that
question.
i
was
talking
about
the
picketing.
the
picketing
had
seized
by
the
time
of
exhibit
9.
exhibit
9
refers
to
the
time
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
six
petitioners
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
office
and
were
on
the
sidewalk,
in
front
of
it.
at
that
point,
a
crowd
composed
of
the
other
demonstrators
--
that
is
the
picketers
and
onlookers,
gathered
around
to
watch.
it
is
unclear
on
the
record,
whether
or
not
that
crowd
of
onlookers
was
already
obstructing
the
sidewalk
in
the
way
in
which
you
see
at
9:00
before
they
were
thrown
out,
or
whether
that
happened
when
they
were
thrown
out.
that
is
not
a
picket
line,
your
honor,
that
is
a
crowd
that
is
watching.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
certainly
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
are
at
that
point
depending
on
the
view
one
takes
to
the
testimony
which
was
never
resolved
by
the
jury.
either
still
engaged
in
a
demonstration
were
lying
on
the
ground
where
they
were
thrown
because
they
haven't
yet
a
change
to
pick
themselves
up.
if
that
issue
had
been
resolved
by
the
jury,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
by
any
means.
certainly
not
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
and
in
any
event
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
unless
the
public
responds
--
well,
i
better
not
go
that
far.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
that
so.
let
me
take
the
statute
apart
and
see.
in
one
sense
response
is
necessary.
that
is,
under
the
definition
of
disorderly
conduct
which
involves
doing
something
which
offends,
disturbs
or
incites,
the
reaction
of
the
crowd
is
relevant.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
whether
it
tends
to
incite
may
not
turn
the
liability
on
actual
reaction
by
the
crowd.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
did
indeed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
no
question
about
it.
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
our
position
here
which
both
the
court
below
misunderstood
and
respondent
appears
to
misunderstand.
we
are
not
contending
that
these
petitioners
were
arrested
because
the
police
disagreed
with
their
views,
they
were
not.
we
don't
suggest
that
for
one
moment.
what
we
suggest
is
two
things.
first
of
all,
what
is
an
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
reason
for
their
arrest.
what's
involved
before
this
court
is
a
basis
for
their
conviction
and
they
were
convicted
on
the
theory
that
they
did
something
which
offended,
disturbed
or
incited.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
obstructing
the
sidewalk
or
any
basis
for
the
police
arrest.
secondly,
the
offense
disturbing
and
inciting
has
to
do
with
the
crowd's
response
to
their
ideas.
we're
not
saying
the
police
disagreed
with
their
ideas.
what
we're
saying
is
that
police
arrested
them
because
they
disturbed
the
crowd.
what
your
honor
is
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
exactly
is
right,
that
this
offense
turns
in
large
part,
if
not
exclusively
on
a
crowd's
reaction.
and
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is,
that
the
crowd
reacted
with
hostility
to
the
petitioners.
why?
not
because
of
their
position
on
the
street,
because
of
their
position
in
vietnam,
that's
plain
and
that's
plain
on
the
state's
own
testimony.
and
as
a
result
of
that
hostility,
the
police
then
proceeded
to
arrest
them
for
creating
a
disturbance.
now,
it
is
the
purpose
of
disorderly
conduct
was,
to
prevent
the
public
from
being
upset,
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
to
prevent
disorderly
conduct
laws
from
allowing
convictions
where
the
offset
is
ideological.
that
is
the
essence
of
our
submission
in
this
case.
now,
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
the
issues
presented
because
in
my
view,
the
respondent
takes
a
very
different
issue
--
very
different
view
of
the
issues
than
petitioner.
and
i
think
who
is
ultimately
right
on
the
merits
of
this
case
depends
on
large
part
if
not
exclusively
and
whose
formulation
of
the
issues
is
the
correct
one.
for
that
reason,
i
wanted
to
tell
the
court
exactly
what
i
think
the
issues
are.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
these
petitioners
had
done
something
for
which
maryland
can
constitutionally
punish.
more
specifically,
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
sit
in
on
a
recruiting
office.
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk.
it
is
not
whether
they
have
a
right
to
obstruct
the
sidewalk.
i
am
not
asserting
that
they
have
any
of
those
rights.
what
they
have
a
right
to
is
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
whether
they
did
any
of
those
things
under
a
statute
which
in
terms
punishes
doing
those
things.
so
that
the
issues
submitted
to
the
jury
and
fairly
decided
by
the
jury
would
be
whether
the
petitioners
did
anything
that
maryland
had
a
constitutional
right
to
punish.
now,
that
is
not
this
trial
and
that
is
not
this
statute.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
profoundly
disagree
with
the
respondent's
statement
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
respondents
make
it
a
simple
case.
petitioners
obstructed
the
sidewalk,
they
were
told
to
move
on,
therefore
they
were
charged
with
refusing
to
move
on
after
being
told
that
this
is
so
because
they
were
obstructing
the
sidewalk
and
that's
a
perfectly
constitutional
charge.
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
the
first
time
petitioners
have
been
charged
with
that
is
in
this
court,
and
if
i
may
refer
to
the
record,
i
think
i
can
satisfy
the
court
pretty
squarely
on
that
point.
what
the
respondents
say
specifically
in
their
brief
is,
petitioners
were
arrested
for
blocking
the
sidewalk
and
for
failure
to
obey
a
policeman's
command
to
move
on,
when
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace.
an
examination
of
the
record
clearly
discloses
that
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
was
a
prevailing
factor
because
they
arrested
petitioners
not
disagreement
with
their
ideas.
i
think
i've
already
pointed
out
that
the
issue
here
is
not
what
they
were
arrested
for,
it's
what
they've
been
convicted
for.
and
at
this
point,
when
we
want
to
ask
what
they
were
convicted
for,
and
i
want
to
look
at
another
aspect
of
the
respondent's
brief.
the
respondent
point's
out
at
page
42
that
the
prosecutor
elected
not
to
proceed
under
the
maryland
statute
governing
obstruction
of
the
streets.
the
respondent
suggested
it's
immaterial
that
the
state
didn't
proceed
under
that
statute.
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
the
state
didn't
proceed
under
that
statute
is
the
essence
of
this
case
because
what
the
charge
was,
it
was
in
fact
may,
was
the
broad
general
disorderly
charge
under
section
123.
now
that
charge
as
i've
said
has
two
aspects.
doing
or
saying
or
both
of
anything
that
offends,
disturbs
or
incites.
now,
with
regard
to
that
charge,
i
want
to
point
out,
that
there's
not
only
nothing
in
it
about
obstructing
sidewalks
but
there's
nothing
in
it
about
disobeying
a
police
order.
and
this
was
put
before
the
jury
as
a
separate
ground
of
conviction,
with
all
the
facts
including
chief
justice
burger,
the
background
facts
like
the
fact
that
these
people
were
walking
with
signs
and
that
they
were
singing
“we
shall
overcome”
and
they
were
on
the
street.
now,
the
state
even
in
this
court
caused
their
singing
on
the
sidewalk,
misplaced,
vocalizing
and
suggested
that
it
was
disorderly
because
it
prevented
them
for
hearing
police
orders.
and
that's
why
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
focus
in
this
case
not
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
obstructing
a
sidewalk
or
anything
else.
certain
of
their
conduct
was
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
picketing
was
with
the
placards
and
with
the
signs
and
singing
“we
shall
overcome,”
not
all
of
it,
but
some
parts
of
it.
the
state's
charge
here
was
a
blunderbuss.
it
was
a
charge
that
they
did
offend,
disturb,
and
incite
a
crowd
of
people.
that's
the
issue
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
now,
for
the
state
then
to
abandon
that
up
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
to
say
that
that
head
of
liability
which
it
insisted
on
to
get
these
convictions
and
then
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
pardon
me,
in
the
court
of
special
appeals
stood
on
to
get
the
conviction
affirmed
is
now
to
be
abandoned,
and
this
is
to
turn
into
an
obstructing
the
sidewalk
case,
is
to
do
precisely
what
this
court
in
gregory
and
a
number
or
other
cases
has
said
cannot
be
done.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
most
certainly
am
saying
that
no
one
could
know
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
but
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
explain
why
i'm
saying
that.
a
--
as
i
read
the
statute
on
the
constructions
put
on
it
below.
i
can
sit
down
and
block
the
sidewalk
all
i
want
and
i
don't
violate
the
statute.
unless
i
offend,
disturb,
incite
or
tend
to
incite
a
number
of
people
or
disobey
a
police
order
when
not
to
move
on
may
endanger
the
public
peace,
i
have
not
violated
the
statute.
now,
if
i
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
be
disturbing
those
people
who
wants
to
use
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
the
statute
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
disturbing,
it
is
a
matter
of
acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace.
that
doesn't
simply
mean
disturbing
any
individual
from
engaging
in
his
own
pursuits.
the
notion
of
disturbing
a
public
peace
is
one
with
which
courts
have
struggled
for
a
long
time
and
this
court
witnessed
state
court
definitions
of
disturbance
of
the
peace
in
cox,
in
edwards
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
the
very
different
thing
from
simply
disturbing
somebody
who
wants
to
walk
along
the
street.
and
in
any
event,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
petitioner's
request
to
the
jury,
request
to
charge
the
jury
would
have
been
to
limit
the
statute
to
exactly
that.
we
admit
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
in
what
it
means.
i
do
think
that
one
would
not
know
that
sitting
down
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
in
any
event,
i
am
clear
on
one
thing,
that
the
jury
should
know
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
when
it
comes
time
to
try
the
case.
and
that
when
the
trial
judge
submits
the
issue
in
terms
of
generally
disturbing,
offending
and
inciting,
and
we
asked
for
instructions
that
say,
it's
only
if
you
disturb
people
by
obstructing
the
sidewalk.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
you're
guilty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
one
other
thing
i
should
respond
mr.
justice
white,
your
question
assumes
something
that
i
think
the
court
may
well
assume
when
it
comes
to
this
case
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear,
i
don't
think
it's
a
fair
assumption.
that
is
the
assumption
that
these
people
sat
on
the
sidewalk.
now,
i'm
not
as
i
said
in
the
brief,
i'm
not
going
to
be
evasive
about
that.
that
issue
was
not
fairly
tried
below
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
way
this
case
had
gone
to
jury,
the
question
presented
was
allow
the
jury
to
resolve
whether
they
did
or
didn't
sit
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
the
testimony
is
conflicting
on
that.
and
i
think
that
is
was
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
only
of
the
issues
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
for
their
resolution.
when
the
trial
court
submits
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
conduct
offended,
disturbed
or
incited
a
crowd,
to
take
the
jury's
verdict
then
settling
a
proposition
that
they
sat
on
the
sidewalk
would
be
totally
incomprehensible.
if
the
trial
court
had
said
to
the
jury,
did
they
or
did
they
not
willfully,
indeed
we
submit
an
instruction.
i
think
if
the
court
will
take
a
look
at
our
proposed
instructions.
we
submitted
instructions
at
page
15,
16,
17
which
would
have
allowed
the
definition
of
the
offense
in
exactly
those
terms.
an
alternative
instruction
i-a
had
three
heads
of
liability.
one
of
which
was
knowingly
and
purposely
engaging
in
acts
which
they
had
no
lawful
right
to
do,
which
obstructed
or
hinder
pedestrians
and
traffic.
over
on
the
next
page
16
of
the
appendix,
our
instruction
would
have
defined
in
precisely
mr.
justice
white's
terms
obstructing
traffic.
if
those
instructions
had
been
given
and
the
jury
had
voted
against
these
petitioners,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
that
wouldn't
be
this
case.
but
what
was
submitted
to
the
jury
was
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
sat
on
the
sidewalk
but
a
broader
one.
now,
there
is
one
aspect
of
the
court's
charge
that
may
seem
to
submit
that
question.
it
is
not
in
the
portion
defining
the
offense,
but
it
is
on
page
157
where
in
describing
the
defense
case,
and
i
want
to
--
taking
aside
one
moment
to
point
out
that,
the
court
summarized
the
evidence
here
as
well
as
giving
instructions
on
the
law.
when
it
summarized
the
prosecution's
case,
where
you
would
think
at
least
it
would
mention
obstruction,
if
obstruction
was
an
issue
even
though
that
was
an
illegal
element.
the
court
didn't
even
talk
about
obstruction.
there
is
nothing
either
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
on
the
law
nor
on
summary
even
of
the
prosecutor's
case
would
suggest
that
obstruction
was
an
issue
here.
and
therefore,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
they
sat
there,
whether
they
have
obstructed
anything
was
not
resolved
by
the
jury.
now,
the
one
quibble
that
one
might
have
with
that
is
this,
there
is
instating
the
defense
case
a
statement
that,
the
position
of
the
defense
is
that,
they
didn't
here
the
command
of
the
officers
to
get
up
and
move
on.
if
that
is
the
case,
they
had
a
right
to
sit
on
the
sidewalk
or
in
the
case
of
one
or
two
of
them
restrained
there
by
the
end
of
office.
but
notice
that
the
general
jury
charge
submits
two
theories
of
liability.
offending,
disturbing
and
inciting
is
one
and
the
other
is
refusing
to
move
on.
this
says
that
they
had
a
right
to
sit
on
the
sidewalk,
i.e.
not
to
move
on,
if
they
didn't
hear
the
instruction
of
the
officers.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
they're
guilty
or
not
guilty
under
the
first
theory.
and
it
is
perfectly
consistent
that
the
jury
in
resolving
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
found
that
although
they
did
not
willfully
sit
down,
they
were
thrown
there
by
the
officers.
although,
they
did
not
have
a
chance
to
get
up,
or
although
they
were
held
down
which
is
their
testimony
that
nevertheless
they
did
something
which
offended,
disturbed
and
incited
a
crowd
to
with
the
misplaced
vocalizing
which
the
state
now
talks
about
singing
“we
shall
overcome.”
the
total
current
text
of
that
activity
which
your
honor
really
are
suggested,
picketing
outside,
going
into
a
recruiting
office,
presenting
literature
and
then
refusing
to
leave
the
office
and
then
getting
out
on
the
street,
i
think
the
jury
in
fact
didn't
resolve
these
conflicts.
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
for
this
court
to
say
it
did.
the
jury
took
this
case
the
way
the
state
submitted.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
such
a
rule
in
maryland.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
are
supposed
to
be
merely
advisory.
but
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
held
that
a
conviction
is
reversible
if
the
advisory
instructions
are
wrong,
it
seems
very
clear
that
this
court
would
have
to
say
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
whether
the
instructions
were
wrong.
and
if
they
were
wrong,
then
the
judgment
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
court
were
disposed
to
treat
maryland
differently
than
any
other
jurisdiction
for
that
purpose,
that
maryland's
whole
law
disorderly
conduct
would
have
to
be
unconstitutional
because
what
that
would
do
would
be
to
deprive
this
court
of
imposing
legal
restrictions
on
the
formulation
of
rules
in
the
first
amendment
area.
and
that
very
deprivation
would
cause
inevitably
the
kind
of
vagueness
and
over
breadth
which
this
court
has
held
bad
when
applied
to
first
amendment
conduct
if
it
really
is
true
and
i
simply
do
not
take
it
seriously,
because
frankly,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
doesn't
take
it
seriously,
that
the
jury
is
judge
to
the
fact.
for
all
ordinary
trial
purposes,
it
isn't.
counsel
can
get
up
and
argue
when
the
jury
is
told
that
they
are
in
that
sort
of
things.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
brady
and
as
the
(inaudible)
opinion
that
it
refers
to
in
brady
pointed
out,
only
ordinary
rules
of
review
are
applicable
in
maryland.
if
the
instruction
is
wrong,
the
jury
judgment
gets
reversed.
that's
all
that's
in
issue
here.
was
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
this
instruction
wrong
and
rendered
wrong
because
of
refusal
to
give
the
requested
charges,
and
if
so,
maryland
law
itself
says
that
this
judgment
has
to
be
reversed.
