mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
mr.
chief
justice,
so
as
the
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
principal
issue
raised
by
petitioners
namely,
that
they
were
tried
for
the
wrong
crime,
it
would
assist
the
state's
presentation
if
the
court
would
permit
the
state
to
present
it,
their
argument
first
from
the
stand
point
of
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
petitioners
by
reviewing
the
actual
facts
involved.
secondly,
considering
the
issue
of
vagueness
which
the
petitioners
raised
and
finally,
from
the
instructions
to
jury.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
this
is
not
a
complicated
case.
however,
the
facts
must
be
considered
in
detail
to
present
a
prompt
and
to
arrive
at
a
proper
legal
determination.
the
state
anticipates
emphasizing
in
its
argument
that
this
is
a
disorderly
conduct
case,
not
a
freedom
of
speech
case.
the
arrest
and
prosecution
of
petitioners
was
based
on
their
disorderly
conduct
which
caused
a
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
on
a
street
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
petitioners
were
a
portion
of
a
group
demonstrating
against
united
states
policy
in
vietnam.
however,
their
political
views
and
ideas
did
not
cause
their
arrest
and
prosecution.
this
position
is
established
by
the
recognition
that
a
minimum
of
35
to
40
demonstrators
whose
activities
were
peaceful
were
not
arrested
but
on
the
contrary,
they
received
police
protection
and
were
granted
complete
freedom
to
picket
an
army
recruiting
office
and
distribute
literature
to
unsympathetic
onlookers.
only
when
the
petitioners
sat
down
on
a
10
to
12-foot
wide
sidewalk,
in
a
commercial
section
in
the
city,
blocked
it
as
public
passageway,
refused
officer’s
request
to
move,
were
they
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct.
these
demonstrators
could
still
be
picketing,
if
the
petitioners
had
not
laid
down
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
correct
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
state
law
which
is
embodied
in
the
interpretation
affixed
to
article
27,
section
123
which
is
your
state
disorderly
conduct
statute.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
there
is
a
section
121
of
article
27
i
think.
now,
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
arrest
and
prosecution
was
based
on
expression
of
their
political
views
and
ideas.
the
respondent
of
course
argues
that
the
arrest
and
their
conviction
was
based
on
disorderly
conduct
and
the
vehicle
used
for
the
prosecution
namely
article
27
section
123
is
a
valid
constitutional
vehicle.
at
the
outset,
the
respondent
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
“fighting
words”
of
chaplinski.
it
is
not
a
racial
arrest
that
was
patently
illegal
such
as
we
had
shuttlesworth,
cox
and
edwards.
it
is
not
a
pure
speech
case
such
as
we
had
in
terminiello.
it
is
not
a
peaceful
picketing
as
was
in
gregory.
the
case
is
purely
and
simply
an
instance
where
the
conduct
of
the
six
petitioners
was
disorderly.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
none
--
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
there
was
no
testimony
offered
either
for
the
prosecution
or
by
the
defense
that
any
verbal
remarks,
any
words
were
used.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
at
any
time
during
outside
of
the
singing
that
went
on.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes,
well,
the
evidence
does
not
indicate
whether
they
were
then
carrying
handbills
inside.
they
had
a
large
poster
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct.
that
they
wanted
to
place
inside
in
the
window.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
words
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
well,
alright,
let's
assume
there
was.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
there
would
be
no
basis
for
arriving
at
that
level,
your
honor
because
the
only
words
brought
out
were
the
singing
that
was
done.
but
there
were
signs
carried
by
the
picketers.
there
was
a
sign
that
the
petitioners
attempted
to
have
place
inside
the
recruiting
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
well,
this
court
has
ruled
that
picketing
is
not
pure
speech
so
that
we
get
in
that
never,
never
land,
that
gray
area
where
it's
not
purely
covered
by
the
first
amendment
umbrella
of
protection.
we
might
have
symbolically
perforated
umbrella
that
we're
going
to
call
and
bring
in
to
play
if
we're
going
to
get
into
an
area
than
carrying
signs.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
need
reach,
need
confront
itself
with
that
problem
because
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
transcript
to
indicate
that
when
the
petitioners
left
or
were
ejected
from
the
recruiting
office,
that
any
signs
were
in
their
hands,
mr.
justice
white.
approaching
the
position,
when
the
petitioners
were
in
the
recruiting
office
and
for
a
period
of
two
hours
remain,
while
peaceful
picketing
and
this
is
very
emphatically
demonstrated
by
referring
to
the
state's
exhibits
4,
5,
6,
7
and
8
demonstrates
the
peaceful
picketing
outside
the
recruiting
office.
it
indicates
that
there
are
no
crowd
had
gathered
on
the
sidewalk.
it
indicates
that
police
protection
was
afforded
these
picketers
for
a
two-hour
period
on
state's
exhibit
number
8
which
is
on
page
169,
on
the
left
hand
side,
the
uniformed
policeman
would
be
observed,
noticing
the
peaceful
picketing
that
is
transpired.
and
of
course
the
sidewalk
is
perfectly
clear,
one
half
of
the
sidewalk
approximately
seems
to
be
utilized
by
the
picketers,
whereas
the
other
half
permits
free
passage
by
pedestrians.
when
the
point
in
time
was
reached
that
the
petitioners
were
inside
the
office
and
requested
to
move
by
the
sergeant,
five
o'clock
arrived,
they
refused.
so
certainly,
if
we
did
not
have
a
trespass
between
three
and
five,
a
trespass
certainly
occurred
at
five
o'clock.
i
would
submit
that
it
was
a
reasonable
removal
since
it
was
closing
time.
the
removal
was
accomplished
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i've
got
to
clogged
up
your
station
tube,
your
honor,
so
that
might
account
from
me
not
hearing
you.
proceed
if
you
will
please.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
sergeant
ramley,
the
recruiting
officer
assigned
to
the
recruiting
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
exhibit
9
on
page
170
mr.
justice
would
have
to
be
taken
sometime
between
5:00
and
5:15.
this
was
taken
after
the
petitioners
were
ejected
from
the
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
no,
as
i
say,
the
testimony
indicates
that
exhibit
9,
this
photograph
was
taken
after
the
petitioners
were
ejected
from
the
recruiting
office.
yes,
there
were
police
officers
in
the
middle
and
this
crowd
is
combined
of
--
and
you
might
also
refer
to
state
exhibits
2,
mr.
justice,
on
page
173
which
gives
a
close
up
view
of
that.
now,
after
the
petitioners
had
been
removed
from
the
building,
there
was
testimony
indicating
two
petitioners
tried
to
crawl
back
in.
there
was
an
ample
supply
of
police
present.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
phoned
the
police
department
the
day
before
the
demonstration
to
advise
them
that
such
a
demonstration
would
take
place.
and
i
might
add
that
this
is
a
common
occurrence.
there
were
officers
from
the
two
districts
bordering
on
this
particular
locality,
as
well
as
officers
from
the
traffic
division.
now,
the
state's
position
is
that
this
disturbance
on
the
sidewalk
was
caused
directly
by
the
petitioner's
refusal
to
get
up,
stand
and
move.
this
blockage
of
the
sidewalk
occurred
when
the
petitioners
refused
to
move.
as
many
as
five
requests
were
made,
three
by
one
officer,
two
by
another.
the
petitioners
took
the
position
that
they
did
not
hear
the
request.
an
explanation
is
offered
that
possibly
the
singing
at
that
time
could
have
been
of
such
volume
that
the
petitioners
did
not
hear
the
officer's
request.
nevertheless,
a
rebuttal
witness
when
fogerty,
a
newspaper
reporter
testified
that
he
saw
the
officers
standing
at
the
feet
of
the
petitioners
talking
to
them.
because
of
the
noise
of
the
crowd,
he
could
not
hear
the
words
that
were
directed.
now,
we
reached
the
level
as
to
the
particular
crime
with
which
the
petitioners
were
charged.
certainly,
if
our
states
attorney
is
to
possess
any
degree
of
discretion,
he
is
the
one
that
makes
the
decision
as
to
what
particular
statute
he
will
charge
the
accused
of.
we
have
not
reached
the
point
where
the
accused
is
going
to
select
the
statute
that
he
wishes
to
be
prosecuted
by,
certainly
he
was
in
violation
of
121,
the
blockage
of
the
sidewalk.
but
certainly,
he
was
in
violation
of
123,
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
number
one,
the
disorderly
conduct
violation
occurred
when
he
hit
the
sidewalk
and
remained
in
that
position,
he
could
have
stood,
they
could
have
stood,
they
could
have
joined
their
fellow
picketers
but
they
chose
to
flop
on
the
sidewalk
and
prevent
the
use
of
the
sidewalk
with
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended,
namely
the
free
passage
by
pedestrians.
instead,
they
very
selfishly
chose
to
make
use
of
their
own
purpose
for
utilizing
the
sidewalk.
now,
the
court
will
i'm
sure
consider
the
position
that
the
police
are
placed
at
that
time.
they
must
make
a
decision.
may
they
permit
the
petitioners
to
utilize
the
sidewalk
for
a
purpose
for
which
the
sidewalk
was
not
built
and
deny
pedestrians
the
right
to
use
the
sidewalk
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
was
built.
and
if
they
do
make
that
determination,
then
it
would
follow
that
they
would
have
to
detour
the
pedestrians
into
the
street.
and
the
problem
that
presents
itself
then
is
the
danger,
not
only
to
pedestrians
but
also
to
the
motorist
as
presented.
another
possible
avenue
of
escape
for
the
police
officers
at
this
point
is
to
detour
the
pedestrian,
so
that
they
will
avoid
the
area
that
is
being
blocked
by
the
petitioners.
in
which
case,
can
they
properly
detour
pedestrian
traffic
one
block
north
and
one
block
south
of
the
location?
and
if
so,
what
position
are
the
police
in
if
one
of
the
pedestrians
refuses
to
follow
the
detour?
may
that
pedestrian
be
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct?
and
assume
if
you
will
that
that
procedure
is
followed,
and
again
i
call
the
court's
attentions
to
the
exhibits
and
to
the
various
shops
that
are
on
that
side
of
the
street
are
the
rights
of
these
shop
owners
denied,
if
the
pedestrians
are
not
permitted
to
use
that
side
of
the
street?
all
of
these
are
practical
problems
with
which
the
police
were
presented
at
that
time.
however,
returning
to
the
question
raised
by
petitioner
at
this
time
that
the
state's
position
is
that
the
states
attorney
has
a
right.
he
has
a
responsibility
as
to
elect
which
particular
violation
that
he
decides
to
proceed
under
and
he
did
so
in
this
particular
case
by
acting
to
proceed
under
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
a
word
on
the
vagueness
of
the
maryland
statute
as
alleged
by
petitioners,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
conditions
as
i
have
described
and
as
the
maryland
jury
found
to
exist
and
as
the
maryland
appellate
court
found
to
exist,
assuming
arguendo
that
these
conditions
exist
too,
what
tool
did
the
baltimore
city
police
officer
have
to
counteract
this
action.
and
i
submit
it
is
title
27
article
23
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
and
also
of
course,
the
blockage
of
the
sidewalk,
and
so
far
as
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
is
concerned
and
i
am
reading
verbatim,
“acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
upon
any
public
street
or
highway
in
any
city,
town
or
county
of
the
state,
and
the
question
is
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
void
for
vagueness.”
the
problem
exists
admittedly
in
drafting
any
disorderly
conduct
statute.
it
is
literally
impossible
to
articulate
with
the
utmost
specificity
all
of
the
precise
activities
which
are
prescribed.
disorderly
conduct
activity
defines
precise
statutory
definition.
the
subject
decides
the
greater
specificity
is
not
feasible.
now,
the
state
would
submit
that
the
interpretation
given
to
the
statute
by
maryland
court
of
appeals
gives
fair
warning
to
the
common
man
as
to
precisely
what
actions
are
prohibited.
and
this
interpretation
is
the
gist
of
the
crime
of
disorderly
conduct
and
i
am
reading
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i
am
reading
from
my
notes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i'll
refer
you
to
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
--
page
29
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
the
bottom.
the
gist
of
the
crime
of
disorderly
conduct
as
it
was
in
the
cases
of
common
law
predecessor
crimes
is
a
doing
or
saying
or
both
of
that
which
offends,
disturbs,
incites
or
tends
to
incite
a
number
of
people
gathered
in
the
same
area.
also
it
has
been
held
the
failure
to
obey
a
policeman's
command
to
move
on
or
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace
amounts
to
disorderly
conduct.
in
considering
whether
this
statute
as
interpreted,
is
sufficiently
clear
to
a
person
of
common
intelligence,
i
would
first
remind
the
court
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
all
college
students
or
college
graduates
and
no
suggestions
has
been
made
that
they
lack
common
intelligence.
this
court
moreover
has
twice
considered
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
in
the
drews
cases
in
‘64
and
‘65
and
no
quarrel
was
found
with
its
constitutionality
on
the
vagueness
issue.
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland
in
deciding
this
case
made
specific
reference
to
the
findings
of
this
court
in
drews.
now,
let's
consider
the
other
state,
the
other
enactments
of
other
states
in
an
attempt
to
draw
a
comparison
with
the
maryland
statute.
set
out
on
pages
55
thru
69
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
state
has
attempted
to
offer
for
this
court's
consideration,
the
disorderly
conduct
statutes
of
all
the
states,
and
also
the
ali
model
penal
code
disorderly
conduct
statute.
they
all
seem
to
be
strikingly
similar
in
their
wording
and
i
would
certainly
submit
that
the
common
man
would
have
less
difficulty
considerable
less
difficulty
in
understanding,
comprehending
and
applying
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
to
himself
than
he
would
to
many,
many
other
statutes
including
--
i
might
also
suggest
our
income
tax,
regulations.
simple
generic
terms
had
been
used
in
the
statute
and
this
expressed
to
man
of
common
intelligence
what
is
necessary
or
what
is
prohibited.
i
would
suggest
that
the
10
commandments
are
expressed
in
the
simplest
of
terms,
yet
they're
completely
understandable
to
the
sinner,
although
theologians
might
experience
some
difficulty
in
agreeing
on
interpretation.
the
same
might
apply
to
the
disorderly
conduct
statute,
i
don't
think
that
the
common
man
would
experience
difficulty
in
applying
this
statute,
however,
lawyers
or
judges
might
well
contest
its
specific
meaning
as
it
had
been
doing
for
centuries
over
such
terms
as
probable
cause,
due
process,
reasonable,
competent,
fair
or
proper.
i
would
refer
this
court
to
words
of
justice
frankfurter
in
addison
versus
holly
hill
where
he
stated,
“legislation
when
not
expressed
in
technical
terms
as
addressed
to
the
common
realm
of
man
as
therefore
to
be
understood
according
to
the
sense
of
the
thing,
as
the
ordinary
man
has
a
right
to
rely
on
ordinary
words
addressed
to
him.
this
court
has
in
the
recent
past
considered
similar
disorderly
conduct
statutes
in
zwicker
versus
boll
in
the
woodward
case
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief
where
the
seventh
circuit
considered
a
similar
illinois
statute
and
in
neither
instance,
where
these
statutes
held
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
as
recently
as
november
1969,
in
the
o'leary
case
where
the
issue
was
whether
statutory
over
breadth
in
a
kentucky
statute
which
prohibited
“acts
and
words
likely
to
produce
violence
and
others”
this
language
was
upheld,
well
certainly
was
denied.
the
final
argument
advanced
by
petitioners
namely
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
and
at
that
this
charge
was
of
constitutional
dimensions.
i
would
point
out
that
all
instructions
in
criminal
cases
given
by
judges
to
juries
in
maryland
are
advisory
only.
maryland
is
one
of
two
states
having
this
provision
in
its
constitution.
this
court
has
taken
cognizance
of
this
procedure
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
the
maryland
rules
of
procedures
specified
that
the
court
need
not
grant
any
requested
instruction
if
the
matter
is
fairly
covered,
and
i
emphasized
fairly
covered,
by
the
instructions
actually
given.
decisions
of
the
maryland
courts
permit
counsel
to
argue
to
the
jury
the
facts
and
the
law
even
if
it's
contrary
to
the
advisory
instructions
given
by
the
trial
judge.
and
where
the
trial
judge
refuses
to
permit
counsel
to
argue
the
law
and
the
facts
reversals
have
resulted.
now,
the
requested
instructions
that
the
petitioners
offered
in
number
1
thru
4
(a)
and
also
8,
were
properly
covered
by
the
instructions
of
the
nisi
prius
jurors.
instructions
5,
6
and
7,
are
all
based
on
the
expression
of
views
or
ideas
theory.
these
instructions
were,
it
is
true,
refused
by
the
maryland
trial
judge
and
we
feel
properly
refused.
and
the
reason
for
the
refusal
is
found
in
the
opinion
of
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals,
i'm
reading
from
page
180
of
the
transcript,
the
evidence
before
the
trial
court
clearly
established
that
the
arrest
and
charges
resulted
from
appellant's
refusal
to
cease
their
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
and
result
in
public
disturbance,
and
because
they
had
refused
to
comply
with
the
three
lawful
commands
of
the
police
officer
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
it
was
a
general
verdict.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
instructions
as
given
by
the
nisi
prius
jurors
were
to
the
effect
that
these
are
both
questions
that
are
open
for
resolution.
it
is
your
responsibility
to
make
the
resolution
on
these
two
issues.
and
that
resolution
would
have
had
to
be
made
in
the
affirmative
by
reason
of
the
general
verdict
that
followed.
we
further
note
that
the
standing
demonstration
--
demonstrators
were
not
arrested
since
the
evidence
adduced
below
rejected
any
substance
to
the
allegations
that
the
arrest
were
predicated
upon
suppression
of
political
views,
the
instructions
were
properly
rejected.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
mr.
chief
justice,
so
as
the
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
the
principal
issue
raised
by
petitioners
namely,
that
they
were
tried
for
the
wrong
crime,
it
would
assist
the
state's
presentation
if
the
court
would
permit
the
state
to
present
it,
their
argument
first
from
the
stand
point
of
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
petitioners
by
reviewing
the
actual
facts
involved.
secondly,
considering
the
issue
of
vagueness
which
the
petitioners
raised
and
finally,
from
the
instructions
to
jury.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
this
is
not
a
complicated
case.
however,
the
facts
must
be
considered
in
detail
to
present
a
prompt
and
to
arrive
at
a
proper
legal
determination.
the
state
anticipates
emphasizing
in
its
argument
that
this
is
a
disorderly
conduct
case,
not
a
freedom
of
speech
case.
the
arrest
and
prosecution
of
petitioners
was
based
on
their
disorderly
conduct
which
caused
a
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
on
a
street
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
petitioners
were
a
portion
of
a
group
demonstrating
against
united
states
policy
in
vietnam.
however,
their
political
views
and
ideas
did
not
cause
their
arrest
and
prosecution.
this
position
is
established
by
the
recognition
that
a
minimum
of
35
to
40
demonstrators
whose
activities
were
peaceful
were
not
arrested
but
on
the
contrary,
they
received
police
protection
and
were
granted
complete
freedom
to
picket
an
army
recruiting
office
and
distribute
literature
to
unsympathetic
onlookers.
only
when
the
petitioners
sat
down
on
a
10
to
12-foot
wide
sidewalk,
in
a
commercial
section
in
the
city,
blocked
it
as
public
passageway,
refused
officer’s
request
to
move,
were
they
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct.
these
demonstrators
could
still
be
picketing,
if
the
petitioners
had
not
laid
down
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
correct
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
state
law
which
is
embodied
in
the
interpretation
affixed
to
article
27,
section
123
which
is
your
state
disorderly
conduct
statute.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
there
is
a
section
121
of
article
27
i
think.
now,
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
arrest
and
prosecution
was
based
on
expression
of
their
political
views
and
ideas.
the
respondent
of
course
argues
that
the
arrest
and
their
conviction
was
based
on
disorderly
conduct
and
the
vehicle
used
for
the
prosecution
namely
article
27
section
123
is
a
valid
constitutional
vehicle.
at
the
outset,
the
respondent
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
“fighting
words”
of
chaplinski.
it
is
not
a
racial
arrest
that
was
patently
illegal
such
as
we
had
shuttlesworth,
cox
and
edwards.
it
is
not
a
pure
speech
case
such
as
we
had
in
terminiello.
it
is
not
a
peaceful
picketing
as
was
in
gregory.
the
case
is
purely
and
simply
an
instance
where
the
conduct
of
the
six
petitioners
was
disorderly.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
none
--
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
there
was
no
testimony
offered
either
for
the
prosecution
or
by
the
defense
that
any
verbal
remarks,
any
words
were
used.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
at
any
time
during
outside
of
the
singing
that
went
on.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes,
well,
the
evidence
does
not
indicate
whether
they
were
then
carrying
handbills
inside.
they
had
a
large
poster
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct.
that
they
wanted
to
place
inside
in
the
window.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
words
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
well,
alright,
let's
assume
there
was.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
there
would
be
no
basis
for
arriving
at
that
level,
your
honor
because
the
only
words
brought
out
were
the
singing
that
was
done.
but
there
were
signs
carried
by
the
picketers.
there
was
a
sign
that
the
petitioners
attempted
to
have
place
inside
the
recruiting
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
well,
this
court
has
ruled
that
picketing
is
not
pure
speech
so
that
we
get
in
that
never,
never
land,
that
gray
area
where
it's
not
purely
covered
by
the
first
amendment
umbrella
of
protection.
we
might
have
symbolically
perforated
umbrella
that
we're
going
to
call
and
bring
in
to
play
if
we're
going
to
get
into
an
area
than
carrying
signs.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
need
reach,
need
confront
itself
with
that
problem
because
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
transcript
to
indicate
that
when
the
petitioners
left
or
were
ejected
from
the
recruiting
office,
that
any
signs
were
in
their
hands,
mr.
justice
white.
approaching
the
position,
when
the
petitioners
were
in
the
recruiting
office
and
for
a
period
of
two
hours
remain,
while
peaceful
picketing
and
this
is
very
emphatically
demonstrated
by
referring
to
the
state's
exhibits
4,
5,
6,
7
and
8
demonstrates
the
peaceful
picketing
outside
the
recruiting
office.
it
indicates
that
there
are
no
crowd
had
gathered
on
the
sidewalk.
it
indicates
that
police
protection
was
afforded
these
picketers
for
a
two-hour
period
on
state's
exhibit
number
8
which
is
on
page
169,
on
the
left
hand
side,
the
uniformed
policeman
would
be
observed,
noticing
the
peaceful
picketing
that
is
transpired.
and
of
course
the
sidewalk
is
perfectly
clear,
one
half
of
the
sidewalk
approximately
seems
to
be
utilized
by
the
picketers,
whereas
the
other
half
permits
free
passage
by
pedestrians.
when
the
point
in
time
was
reached
that
the
petitioners
were
inside
the
office
and
requested
to
move
by
the
sergeant,
five
o'clock
arrived,
they
refused.
so
certainly,
if
we
did
not
have
a
trespass
between
three
and
five,
a
trespass
certainly
occurred
at
five
o'clock.
i
would
submit
that
it
was
a
reasonable
removal
since
it
was
closing
time.
the
removal
was
accomplished
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
i've
got
to
clogged
up
your
station
tube,
your
honor,
so
that
might
account
from
me
not
hearing
you.
proceed
if
you
will
please.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
that
is
sergeant
ramley,
the
recruiting
officer
assigned
to
the
recruiting
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
exhibit
9
on
page
170
mr.
justice
would
have
to
be
taken
sometime
between
5:00
and
5:15.
this
was
taken
after
the
petitioners
were
ejected
from
the
office.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
yes.
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
no,
as
i
say,
the
testimony
indicates
that
exhibit
9,
this
photograph
was
taken
after
the
petitioners
were
ejected
from
the
recruiting
office.
yes,
there
were
police
officers
in
the
middle
and
this
crowd
is
combined
of
--
and
you
might
also
refer
to
state
exhibits
2,
mr.
justice,
on
page
173
which
gives
a
close
up
view
of
that.
now,
after
the
petitioners
had
been
removed
from
the
building,
there
was
testimony
indicating
two
petitioners
tried
to
crawl
back
in.
there
was
an
ample
supply
of
police
present.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
phoned
the
police
department
the
day
before
the
demonstration
to
advise
them
that
such
a
demonstration
would
take
place.
and
i
might
add
that
this
is
a
common
occurrence.
there
were
officers
from
the
two
districts
bordering
on
this
particular
locality,
as
well
as
officers
from
the
traffic
division.
now,
the
state's
position
is
that
this
disturbance
on
the
sidewalk
was
caused
directly
by
the
petitioner's
refusal
to
get
up,
stand
and
move.
this
blockage
of
the
sidewalk
occurred
when
the
petitioners
refused
to
move.
as
many
as
five
requests
were
made,
three
by
one
officer,
two
by
another.
the
petitioners
took
the
position
that
they
did
not
hear
the
request.
an
explanation
is
offered
that
possibly
the
singing
at
that
time
could
have
been
of
such
volume
that
the
petitioners
did
not
hear
the
officer's
request.
nevertheless,
a
rebuttal
witness
when
fogerty,
a
newspaper
reporter
testified
that
he
saw
the
officers
standing
at
the
feet
of
the
petitioners
talking
to
them.
because
of
the
noise
of
the
crowd,
he
could
not
hear
the
words
that
were
directed.
now,
we
reached
the
level
as
to
the
particular
crime
with
which
the
petitioners
were
charged.
certainly,
if
our
states
attorney
is
to
possess
any
degree
of
discretion,
he
is
the
one
that
makes
the
decision
as
to
what
particular
statute
he
will
charge
the
accused
of.
we
have
not
reached
the
point
where
the
accused
is
going
to
select
the
statute
that
he
wishes
to
be
prosecuted
by,
certainly
he
was
in
violation
of
121,
the
blockage
of
the
sidewalk.
but
certainly,
he
was
in
violation
of
123,
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
number
one,
the
disorderly
conduct
violation
occurred
when
he
hit
the
sidewalk
and
remained
in
that
position,
he
could
have
stood,
they
could
have
stood,
they
could
have
joined
their
fellow
picketers
but
they
chose
to
flop
on
the
sidewalk
and
prevent
the
use
of
the
sidewalk
with
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended,
namely
the
free
passage
by
pedestrians.
instead,
they
very
selfishly
chose
to
make
use
of
their
own
purpose
for
utilizing
the
sidewalk.
now,
the
court
will
i'm
sure
consider
the
position
that
the
police
are
placed
at
that
time.
they
must
make
a
decision.
may
they
permit
the
petitioners
to
utilize
the
sidewalk
for
a
purpose
for
which
the
sidewalk
was
not
built
and
deny
pedestrians
the
right
to
use
the
sidewalk
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
was
built.
and
if
they
do
make
that
determination,
then
it
would
follow
that
they
would
have
to
detour
the
pedestrians
into
the
street.
and
the
problem
that
presents
itself
then
is
the
danger,
not
only
to
pedestrians
but
also
to
the
motorist
as
presented.
another
possible
avenue
of
escape
for
the
police
officers
at
this
point
is
to
detour
the
pedestrian,
so
that
they
will
avoid
the
area
that
is
being
blocked
by
the
petitioners.
in
which
case,
can
they
properly
detour
pedestrian
traffic
one
block
north
and
one
block
south
of
the
location?
and
if
so,
what
position
are
the
police
in
if
one
of
the
pedestrians
refuses
to
follow
the
detour?
may
that
pedestrian
be
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct?
and
assume
if
you
will
that
that
procedure
is
followed,
and
again
i
call
the
court's
attentions
to
the
exhibits
and
to
the
various
shops
that
are
on
that
side
of
the
street
are
the
rights
of
these
shop
owners
denied,
if
the
pedestrians
are
not
permitted
to
use
that
side
of
the
street?
all
of
these
are
practical
problems
with
which
the
police
were
presented
at
that
time.
however,
returning
to
the
question
raised
by
petitioner
at
this
time
that
the
state's
position
is
that
the
states
attorney
has
a
right.
he
has
a
responsibility
as
to
elect
which
particular
violation
that
he
decides
to
proceed
under
and
he
did
so
in
this
particular
case
by
acting
to
proceed
under
the
disorderly
conduct
statute.
a
word
on
the
vagueness
of
the
maryland
statute
as
alleged
by
petitioners,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
conditions
as
i
have
described
and
as
the
maryland
jury
found
to
exist
and
as
the
maryland
appellate
court
found
to
exist,
assuming
arguendo
that
these
conditions
exist
too,
what
tool
did
the
baltimore
city
police
officer
have
to
counteract
this
action.
and
i
submit
it
is
title
27
article
23
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
and
also
of
course,
the
blockage
of
the
sidewalk,
and
so
far
as
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
is
concerned
and
i
am
reading
verbatim,
“acting
in
a
disorderly
manner
to
the
disturbance
of
the
public
peace
upon
any
public
street
or
highway
in
any
city,
town
or
county
of
the
state,
and
the
question
is
this
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
void
for
vagueness.”
the
problem
exists
admittedly
in
drafting
any
disorderly
conduct
statute.
it
is
literally
impossible
to
articulate
with
the
utmost
specificity
all
of
the
precise
activities
which
are
prescribed.
disorderly
conduct
activity
defines
precise
statutory
definition.
the
subject
decides
the
greater
specificity
is
not
feasible.
now,
the
state
would
submit
that
the
interpretation
given
to
the
statute
by
maryland
court
of
appeals
gives
fair
warning
to
the
common
man
as
to
precisely
what
actions
are
prohibited.
and
this
interpretation
is
the
gist
of
the
crime
of
disorderly
conduct

of

respondent's
brief
at
the

the
gist
of
the
crime
of
disorderly
conduct
as
it
was
in
the
cases
of
common
law
predecessor
crimes
is
a
doing
or
saying
or
both
of
that
which
offends,
disturbs,
incites
or
tends
to
incite
a
number
of
people
gathered
in
the
same
area.
also
it
has
been
held
the
failure
to
obey
a
policeman's
command
to
move
on
or
not
to
do
so
may
endanger
the
public
peace
amounts
to
disorderly
conduct.
in
considering
whether
this
statute
as
interpreted,
is
sufficiently
clear
to
a
person
of
common
intelligence,
i
would
first
remind
the
court
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
all
college
students
or
college
graduates
and
no
suggestions
has
been
made
that
they
lack
common
intelligence.
this
court
moreover
has
twice
considered
the
maryland
disorderly
conduct
statute
in
the
drews
cases
in
‘64
and
‘65
and
no
quarrel
was
found
with
its
constitutionality
on
the
vagueness
issue.
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland
in
deciding
this
case
made
specific
reference
to
the
findings
of
this
court
in
drews.
now,
let's
consider
the
other
state,
the
other
enactments
of
other
states
in
an
attempt
to
draw
a
comparison
with
the
maryland
statute.
set
out
on
pages
55
thru
69
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
state
has
attempted
to
offer
for
this
court's
consideration,
the
disorderly
conduct
statutes
of
all
the
states,
and
also
the
ali
model
penal
code
disorderly
conduct
statute.
they
all
seem
to
be
strikingly
similar
in
their
wording
and
i
would
certainly
submit
that
the
common
man
would
have
less
difficulty
considerable
less
difficulty
in
understanding,
comprehending
and
applying
this
disorderly
conduct
statute
to
himself
than
he
would
to
many,
many
other
statutes
including
--
i
might
also
suggest
our
income
tax,
regulations.
simple
generic
terms
had
been
used
in
the
statute
and
this
expressed
to
man
of
common
intelligence
what
is
necessary
or
what
is
prohibited.
i
would
suggest
that
the
10
commandments
are
expressed
in
the
simplest
of
terms,
yet
they're
completely
understandable
to
the
sinner,
although
theologians
might
experience
some
difficulty
in
agreeing
on
interpretation.
the
same
might
apply
to
the
disorderly
conduct
statute,
i
don't
think
that
the
common
man
would
experience
difficulty
in
applying
this
statute,
however,
lawyers
or
judges
might
well
contest
its
specific
meaning
as
it
had
been
doing
for
centuries
over
such
terms
as
probable
cause,
due
process,
reasonable,
competent,
fair
or
proper.
i
would
refer
this
court
to
words
of
justice
frankfurter
in
addison
versus
holly
hill
where
he
stated,
“legislation
when
not
expressed
in
technical
terms
as
addressed
to
the
common
realm
of
man
as
therefore
to
be
understood
according
to
the
sense
of
the
thing,
as
the
ordinary
man
has
a
right
to
rely
on
ordinary
words
addressed
to
him.
this
court
has
in
the
recent
past
considered
similar
disorderly
conduct
statutes
in
zwicker
versus
boll
in
the
woodward
case
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief
where
the
seventh
circuit
considered
a
similar
illinois
statute
and
in
neither
instance,
where
these
statutes
held
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
as
recently
as
november
1969,
in
the
o'leary
case
where
the
issue
was
whether
statutory
over
breadth
in
a
kentucky
statute
which
prohibited
“acts
and
words
likely
to
produce
violence
and
others”
this
language
was
upheld,
well
certainly
was
denied.
the
final
argument
advanced
by
petitioners
namely
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
and
at
that
this
charge
was
of
constitutional
dimensions.
i
would
point
out
that
all
instructions
in
criminal
cases
given
by
judges
to
juries
in
maryland
are
advisory
only.
maryland
is
one
of
two
states
having
this
provision
in
its
constitution.
this
court
has
taken
cognizance
of
this
procedure
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
the
maryland
rules
of
procedures
specified
that
the
court
need
not
grant
any
requested
instruction
if
the
matter
is
fairly
covered,
and
i
emphasized
fairly
covered,
by
the
instructions
actually
given.
decisions
of
the
maryland
courts
permit
counsel
to
argue
to
the
jury
the
facts
and
the
law
even
if
it's
contrary
to
the
advisory
instructions
given
by
the
trial
judge.
and
where
the
trial
judge
refuses
to
permit
counsel
to
argue
the
law
and
the
facts
reversals
have
resulted.
now,
the
requested
instructions
that
the
petitioners
offered
in
number
1
thru
4
(a)
and
also
8,
were
properly
covered
by
the
instructions
of
the
nisi
prius
jurors.
instructions
5,
6
and
7,
are
all
based
on
the
expression
of
views
or
ideas
theory.
these
instructions
were,
it
is
true,
refused
by
the
maryland
trial
judge
and
we
feel
properly
refused.
and
the
reason
for
the
refusal
is
found
in
the
opinion
of
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals,
i'm
reading
from
page
180
of
the
transcript,
the
evidence
before
the
trial
court
clearly
established
that
the
arrest
and
charges
resulted
from
appellant's
refusal
to
cease
their
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
and
result
in
public
disturbance,
and
because
they
had
refused
to
comply
with
the
three
lawful
commands
of
the
police
officer
--
mr.
h.
edgar
lentz
it
was
a
general
verdict.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
instructions
as
given
by
the
nisi
prius
jurors
were
to
the
effect
that
these
are
both
questions
that
are
open
for
resolution.
it
is
your
responsibility
to
make
the
resolution
on
these
two
issues.
and
that
resolution
would
have
had
to
be
made
in
the
affirmative
by
reason
of
the
general
verdict
that
followed.
we
further
note
that
the
standing
demonstration
--
demonstrators
were
not
arrested
since
the
evidence
adduced
below
rejected
any
substance
to
the
allegations
that
the
arrest
were
predicated
upon
suppression
of
political
views,
the
instructions
were
properly
rejected.
