mr.
robert
boochever
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
issues
in
this
case
as
in
many
cases
maybe
a
little
clearer
if
we
look
at
it
in
their
historical
context.
alaska,
when
it
was
a
territory
had
its
fisheries
regulated
by
the
federal
government
and
back
in
1926,
the
white
act
was
passed
pertaining
to
the
alaska
fisheries
to
a
considerable
degree.
now,
section
1
of
that
act
provided
that
there
be
no
exclusive
right
or
a
special
right
in
the
fisheries
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
that
section
was
passed
with
--and
the
history
of
it
shows
that
it
was
passed
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
doing
away
with
some
administrative
orders
that
had
existed
prior
to
that
time
whereby
the
licensing
for
fishing
in
certain
areas
was
restricted
to
the
prior
licensees
which
is
basically
what
we're
confronted
with
in
this
subject
litigation,
a
revival
of
this
old
outlawed
provision
that
was
outlawed
by
the
white
act
back
in
1926.
now,
after
the
white
act
was
passed,
the
secretary
of
interior
who
had
a
subsequent
time
had
in
his
powers
the
regulations
of
the
fisheries
of
the
then
territory
of
alaska
provided
for
an
indian
reservation
called
the
carlock
indian
reservation
and
he
provided
in
that
same
regulation
that
the
fishing
in
the
waters
abutting
the
carlock
indian
reservation
would
be
restricted
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees,
in
other
words
the
indians
themselves
could
license
third
persons
to
fish
with
them
in
this
particular
area.
the
matter
was
tried
and
it
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
hynes
against
grimes
packing
company
in
the
337
u.s.
was
decided
in
1949.
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
provision
limiting
the
right
of
fishery
in
these
reservation
waters
even
though
the
promulgating
of
the
regulation
as
far
as
the
establishment
of
the
indian
was
upheld
that
the
secretary
could
not
limit
the
fishing
in
those
waters
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees
because
it
ran
above
of
the
white
act
provision
that
i
have
just
been
referring
to.
now,
this
is
the
background,
that
decision
was
made
in
1949.
in
1955,
prior
to
statehood,
alaska
held
a
constitutional
convention
and
at
that
constitutional
convention,
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
enacted
was
article
8
section
15
and
this
provides
for
a
regulation
or
restriction
on
the
regulation
of
fisheries
almost
identical
to
the
white.
the
provision
and
i
quote
from
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
is
that
“no
exclusive
right
or
special
privilege
of
fishery
should
be
created
or
authorized
in
the
natural
waters
of
the
state.”
and
i
would
like
with
your
honors
indulgence
to
read
the
comment
of
the
natural
resources
committee
of
the
constitutional
convention
as
to
why
they
enacted
that
particular
constitutional
provision
into
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
it
is
at
page
31.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
sir.
in
proposing
section
15
of
alaska
constitution,
the
natural
resources
committee
of
the
constitutional
convention
made
the
following
commentary,
no
exclusive
right
of
fishery.
this
section
is
intended
to
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
provision
prohibiting
the
several
right
of
fisheries
in
the
white
act.
instead
of
using
the
terminology
of
that
act,
the
purposes
sought
by
it
are
a
given
expression
in
a
prohibition
of
exclusive
right
or
special
privileges
of
any
person
to
the
fisheries
of
the
state,
and
that's
the
commentary
on
the
article
on
state
lands
and
natural
resources.
now,
your
honor
this
subsequently
was
adopted
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
alaska,
this
provision
as
a
part
of
the
constitution
when
the
constitution
--
when
alaska
was
admitted
to
statehood
in
1959.
and
as
i
have
explained
initially,
this
was
based
on
the
white
act
provision
and
the
purpose
of
that
white
act
provision
was
to
prevent
the
restriction
of
fishing
rights
to
those
who
had
had
those
rights
in
prior
years.
now,
we
have
had
unfortunately
in
alaska
quite
a
history
of
legislative
attempts
that
created
local
favoritism,
efforts
to
give
the
people
in
alaska
advantages
over
non
residence
particularly
and
even
as
to
residence
in
certain
areas
over
other
areas.
i
refer
to
the
case
of
smith
against
freemen
in
280
2d
u.s.
where
it
was
attempted
to
impose
a
$250.00
license
fee
for
non
resident
fisherman
as
opposed
to
a
$1.00
resident
fee.
mullaney
against
anderson
in
342
u.s.
where
they
attempted
a
$50.00
resident
license
fee
as
opposed
to
a
--
$50.00
non
resident
as
oppose
to
a
$5.00
resident
fee.
mr.
robert
boochever
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
robert
boochever
not
as
such,
no.
this
case
does
not
depend
on
none
residency
because
it
would
work
a
discrimination
as
to
residence
in
the
state
as
well
as
non
residence
and
that
it
restricts
it
to
specific
areas
in
the
state.
but
it
also
--
it
is
the
same
general
plan
to
give
an
advantage
to
the
local
fishermen.
that
is
an
unconstitutional
advantage.
in
brown
against
anderson,
the
attempt
was
made
to,
where
under
certain
hardship
conditions,
only
fisherman
of
a
local
area
could
fish
and
no
non
residents
could
come
in
to
fish.
in
the
last
year,
the
case
of
alaska
against
international
union
of
operating
engineers,
393
u.s.
involved
in
attempt
to
give
local
laborers
of
the
union
favoritism
over
non-resident
laborers.
and
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
chapter
186
of
sla
1968,
which
is
the
legislation
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
comes
right
in
this
series
of
an
effort
to
create
a
local
monopoly
in
the
fishing
areas
of
alaska
to
those
who
had
prior
licenses
in
those
particular
areas.
now,
to
better
understand
the
nature
of
this
discrimination,
i
think
some
background
of
the
fishing
processes
and
the
nature
of
the
licenses
required
is
needed.
in
alaska,
any
fisherman
must
have
a
commercial
fishing
license,
every
fisherman
must
have
that.
in
addition
where
fishing
is
done
by
vessels
and
far
and
away,
the
large
amount
of
fishing
is
done
by
vessels,
there
must
be
a
vessel
license.
now,
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
issuance
of
the
commercial
fishing
license
or
the
vessel
license
but
there
is
a
third
thing
that
is
needed
for
the
almost
all
the
fishing
that's
done
in
alaska
and
that
is
a
salmon
net
gear
license,
and
it
is
by
what
we
consider
this
attempt
to
setup
a
monopoly
is
by
use
of
that
salmon
net
gear
license.
the
law
specifies
that
only
those
who
are
licensed
in
prior
years
in
a
specific
area
may
secure
a
salmon
net
gear
license
unless
he
fishes
commercially
for
three
years
in
that
specific
area.
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor,
no
it
does
not.
one
can
troll
without
a
salmon
net
gear
license.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
and
i
might
point
out
right
here
that
trolling
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
fishing,
it
uses
a
different
type
of
vessel.
in
trolling
a
line
is
hung
out
from
the
vessel,
only
four
lines
are
permitted.
mr.
robert
boochever
less
than
5%
are
caught
be
trollers,
95%
are
caught
by
the
net
fisherman;
this
appears
in
the
statistical
reports
of
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
that
is
also
true.
primarily,
the
fish
that
are
caught
by
troll
are
the
large
king
salmon
and
the
silver
pap
salmon
and
they
are
not
as
a
rule
used
in
the
canneries
which
can
the
other
salmons,
they
are
sent
to
the
eastern
market.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
the
principle,
there
is
suck
eye
and
pinks
and
shanks,
the
other
three
varieties.
mr.
robert
boochever
they
are
caught
by
gill
nets
and
by
sane
nets.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
and
for
instance,
in
bristol
bay
which
is
the,
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
the
areas
and
one
of
the,
one
of
the
most
valuable
ot
ther
which
the
largest
runs
of
fish
are
anticipated,
in
fact
they
anticipate
this
coming
year
that
there
will
be
37,000,000
fish
caught
in
bristol
bay
alone,
the
largest
run
they
anticipated
in
record.
and
in
that
area,
it
is
impossible
to
troll.
there
is
no
troll,
the
statistical
report
show
no
troll
caught
fish
and
it
is
well
known
and
the
district
judges
below
had
perfect
cognizance
of
this
that
you
could
drag
a
troll
line
through
there
day
in
and
day
out
and
you'd
never
catch
a
fish
because
of
the
salty
waters
and
the
fact
that
the
suck
eye
salmon
do
not
strike
in
those
waters,
they
will
hit
a
fly
up
in
the
stream
further
up
when
the
water
gets
fresh
but
they
wont
hit
the
troll
lures
and
there's
no
trolling
so
there's
no
way
of
getting
entry
into
this
valuable
fishery
unless
you're
in
the
favorite
class,
those
who
had
a
license
before
or
unless
one
can
secure
the
permission
of
one
of
those
licensees
to
fish
with
you.
in
other
words,
it
is
exactly
the
thing
that
was
prohibited
in
the
hynes
case
where
the
licenses
were
limited
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees.
in
the
hynes
case,
the
carlock
indians
had
authority
to
let
other
people
get
into
the
field
and
issue
licenses.
in
the
subject
case
for
instance
in
bristol
bay,
there
are
two
gear
net
fishermen
usually
to
a
vessel
and
one
owns
the
gear
and
if
you
can't
his
permission
to
fish
with
you
and
you
can't
a
gear
license,
you're
frozen
out
of
the
field,
you
can't
fish
at
all
and
this
of
course
is
the
exact
provision
that
was
involved
in
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
of
article
8
section
15
which
prohibited
the
use
of,
the
exclusive
right
or
special
privilege
in
the
fisheries
and
which
was
interpreted
prior
to
the
adoption
of
alaska
constitution
by
the
supreme
court
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing.
and
i
might
add
that
at
the
time
that
that
was
passed
by
hynes
against
grimes
packing,
we
not
have
only
had
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land,
the
supreme
court,
but
at
that
time,
it
was
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
that
is
the
territory
because
their
territory
had
a
district
court
which
was
a
district
court
for
the
territory
of
alaska
and
it
had
a
joint
function
as
a
territorial
court
and
in
effect
federal
court.
there
was
no
territorial
appellant
court,
the
appeals
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
to
the
supreme
court.
so
we
have
a
clear
decision
on
a
constitutional
provision
not
only
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
but
the
highest
court
of
what
was
then
the
state
and
we
might
--
i
might
add
that
alaska,
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
held
that
when
a
statute
is
adopted
from
another
jurisdiction,
it
takes
with
it
the
construction
placed
on
that
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
that
jurisdiction,
i
refer
to
the
case
of
(inaudible)
against
lathrop
company
in
that
regard.
now,
we
feel
that
not
only
is
this
violative
as
i
have
shown
and
clearly
so
with
a
supreme
court
decision
on
it
already
of
the
federal
constitutional
issues,
of
the
state
constitutional
issues
but
it
also
is
a
discrimination
based
purely
on
past
fishing
efforts
and
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
that
regard,
we
feel
that
the
case
of
takahashi
against
fishing
gain
commission
in
340
34
u.s.
is
very
much
in
point.
as
your
honors,
will
recall
in
that
case,
the
state
of
california
prohibited
fishing
by
certain
aliens
and
in
expressing
their
reason,
they
gave
very
much
the
same
reason
as
my
learned
colleague
here
has
given
today
that
this
was
a
conservation
method.
that
there
was
too
much
gear
in
the
waters
of
california
and
then
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
conserve
fishing
to
reduce
the
amount
of
gear
and
therefore
to
eliminate
certain
aliens
from
the
fishery.
and
this
learned
court
of
course
held
that
that
was
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
even
though
the
purpose
was
a
justifiable
purpose
assuming
it
was
a
justifiable
purpose
that
of
conservation.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
i
think
the
cache
(ph)
case
your
honor
as
stated
in
the
opinion.
there
is
a
unique
case
and
in
fact
they
stated
there
that
one
shouldn't
hypothesize
about
any
other
facts
from
it.
in
that
case,
the
river
boat
pilots
where
officers
of
the
state
itself
and
there
were
only
a
very
limited
number
of
those
positions
available
and
so
under
that
rather
--
that
unique
situation,
it
was
upheld
in
a
divided
decision.
so
that
i
don't
think
the
cache
case
is
applicable
at
all
to
the
situation
which
--
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes,
that
is
so
your
honor.
however,
in
this
subject
case,
what
there
is,
is
in
the
recitation
of
the
statute.
there
is
a
statement
that
experience
plays
a
part
in
management,
in
safety
and
in
law
enforcement.
and
we
served
interrogatories
on
the
state
requesting
any
examples
they
could
give
where
this
was
a
factor.
experience,
i
might
add
in
the
particular
area
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
all
experienced
fishermen
who
have
fished
to
great
deal.
but
they
have
been
denied
the
right
to
fish
in
the
particular
area.
in
answer
to
those
interrogatories,
the
state
was
able
to
furnish
no
example
of
any
one
of
those
areas
where
experience
had
played
a
part.
and
of
course
this
has
come
before
the
court
below
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes,
your
honor
it
was
and
as
i
stated,
they
were
--
there
was
a
very
--
there
were
very
few
people,
they
could
be
in
any
event
employed
as
river
boat
pilots
and
they
were
officers
of
the
state
itself
and
it
was
a
unique
situation
in
that
instance.
mr.
robert
boochever
not
as
such
as
related
to
fishing
in
a
particular
area.
there
is
the
--
certainly
as
i
would
say
a
certain
degree
that
experience
in
any
field
helps
and
certainly
experiences
a
boat
man
would
give
some
experience
to
tort
safety
and
navigating
a
boat.
i
couldn't
deny
that.
but
as
far
as
a
fisherman
who
has
fished
for
instance
in
southeastern
alaska,
where
that
one
area
is
as
large
as
all
the
new
england
states
and
it
has
a
tremendous
shoreline.
well,
the
fisherman
there,
each
fish
in
their
own
little
favorite
harbors
and
their
experience
there
would
give
them
as
far
as
fishing
in
the
rest
of
the
area
is
just
the
same
as
their
experience
fishing
in
bristol
bay
or
somewhere
else
would
be.
so
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
valid
criteria.
however,
i'm
not
arguing
that
point
assuming
that
it
is.
in
this
particular
case,
they
should
not
exclude
based
on
the
past
right
and
then
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
that
exclusive
right
to
decide
who
will
come
in
because
no
one
can
fish
without
fishing
with
the
gear
licensees.
incidentally
your
honors
asked
as
to
what
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
your
honor.
what
i
mean
is
that
in
order
to
fish,
they
have
to
get
the
consent
of
one
of
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
to
fish
commercially
with
a
net,
one
does.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
here
let
me
give
the
example
again
in
bristol
bay.
mr.
robert
boochever
you
can't
troll
in
bristol
bay.
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
i
guess
one
could
do
that.
but
of
course
--
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
you
can
fish
without
catching
fish
if
that's
your
honor
but
that
to
me
is
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no.
there
are
number
of
other
areas
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
but
this
would
eliminate
one
from
fishing
in
the
bristol
bay
area
which
is
in
itself
at
times
as
much
as
half
the
fish
from
the
whole
state.
mr.
robert
boochever
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
this
applies
also
to
each
of
the
areas
independently.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
relationship
between
trolling
which
is
the
one
example
that's
been
given.
there
is
no
relationship
between
trolling
and
same
fishing
or
net
fishing.
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor,
in
some
of
the
areas,
one
can
fish
for
other
fish
besides
salmon.
for
instance
in
southeast
there
is
--
mr.
robert
boochever
in
bristol
bay
to
my
knowledge,
the
salmon
fishery
would
be
the
only
fishery
but
i
could
not
say
that
categorically.
that
is
my
--
mr.
robert
boochever
well
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
not
your
honor
because
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
my
feeling
would
be
that
if
you
have
a
man
who
has
fished
commercially
in
one
area
and
he
has
shown
his
knowledge
and
he's
fished
there.
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
be
discriminated
against
in
fishing
in
another
area
whereby
his
only
means
of
entering
that
field
is
by
the
grace
of
the
licensee
or
else
he
is
subjected
to
leaving
his
vessel,
his
gear
and
try
to
gain
employment
there
or
else
to
do
as
in
the
case
of
the
salmon
fishery
in
bristol
bay,
a
feudal
act
for
three
years.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
i
do
not
your
honor.
not
under
the
state
constitutional
provision.
the
state
constitutional
provision
is
expressed
on
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no
exclusive
right
of
fishing.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
i
do
not
believe
it
does
your
honor.
now,
this
is
a
more
difficult
question.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
say
a
lottery
as
to
whether
this
would
be
permissible.
i
would
say
that's
a
more
difficult
question
under
the
state
constitution
that
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
boochever
of
limiting
the
number
of
fishermen?
yes
your
honor.
it
did
limit
the
number
of
fishermen
but
by
an
unconstitutional
way.
now
--
mr.
robert
boochever
in
answer
to
mr.
--
excuse
me,
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
white
further
if
i
may.
with
reference
to
the
regulation
under
the
state
constitutional
provision,
there
are
number
of
means
that
are
permissible.
they
may
reduce
the
number
of
hours
that
fishing
is
permitted.
they
may
reduce
the
number
of
areas
where
it's
permitted.
they
may
reduce
the
size
of
the
gear
that's
permitted
but
they
can't
create
an
exclusive
or
special
right
in
certain
people
to
fish
in
the
areas.
and
this
is
what
they
have
attempted
to
do
here.
that's
in
our
opinion,
a
clear
violation.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
robert
boochever
i
would
agree
with
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
although
not
under
the
state
exclusive
right
of
fishery
clause.
i
would
agree
that
that
is
the
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
no.
mr.
robert
boochever
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
would
effect
it.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
more
fisherman
and
they
reduced
the
hours
to
such
a
few
hours
that
it
was
uneconomical
to
fish,
then
they're
going
to
have
to
drop
out
of
the
field.
mr.
robert
boochever
it
would
be
more
or
less
on
that
basis.
i
would
say
your
honor
but
this
is
what
was
passed
as
part
of
the
alaska
constitution
and
knowingly
passed
with
the
idea
of
preventing,
giving
any
exclusive
right
to
any
group
in
the
fishery.
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
i
don't
believe
they
are
at
this
time
your
honor.
the
forecast
as
i
mentioned
for
this
coming
year
is
for
the
largest
run
in
the
history
since
the
19th
century.
they
anticipate
over
14
million
fish
in
bristol
bay
alone.
i'm
referring
to
the
bristol
bay
fishery,
it
varies
a
great
deal.
and
one
year,
you'll
have
a
good
run
in
southeastern
alaska.
another
year,
it
will
be
a
good
run
in
bristol
bay
and
the
forecast
this
year
is
for
the
greatest
in
history,
so
that
i
don't
think
we
can
say
it's
a
dwindling
resource
and
it
appears
that
it
is
on
the
upgrade
under
the
state
management
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
your
honor
because
the
--
most
of
the
facts,
which
i
have
stated
are
matters
that
are
so
well
known
in
alaska
that
they
are
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
it
is
difficult.
i
must
admit
to
talk
to
someone
who
is
not
been
in
the
particular
area.
but
our
district
judges,
two
of
the
district
judges
are
long
time
alaska
residents
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
alaska
fishery
and
were
able
to
take
notice
of
what
the
actual
facts
are
in
the
fishery.
secondly,
there
was
no
statement
of
issues
made
by
my
learned
colleague
raising
any
issues
of
fact.
we
brought
up
our
position
initially
in
this
case
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
complaint
and
they
never
as
required
by
the
district
court
rules
for
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
alaska
set
forth
a
factual
issue
challenging
our
position
until
our
oral
argument
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
below
and
in
their
briefs
before
this
court.
now,
i
would
like
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
to
address
myself
to
the
abstention
problem.
in
this
case,
as
i
have
stated,
we
have
a
supreme
court
decision
on
the
alaska
constitutional
issue.
we
have
a
clear
history
of
that
alaska
constitutional
issue.
there
is
therefore
no
reason
why
the
lower
court
should
abstain,
should
have
abstained
because
of
that
issue.
we
had
every
right
to
be
in
the
federal
court
under
diversity
of
citizenship
and
because
of
the
admittedly
substantial
federal
question
that's
involved.
and
so
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
it
does.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
so,
we
are
there
on
both
reasons,
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute,
no
question
but
that
these
plaintiffs
were
denied
the
fishing
right
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
alaska
constitution
has
been
construed
by
the
higher
state
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
land
and
therefore
there
is
no
reason
for
application
of
the
unusual
doctrine
of
abstention.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
issues
in
this
case
as
in
many
cases
maybe
a
little
clearer
if
we
look
at
it
in
their
historical
context.
alaska,
when
it
was
a
territory
had
its
fisheries
regulated
by
the
federal
government
and
back
in
1926,
the
white
act
was
passed
pertaining
to
the
alaska
fisheries
to
a
considerable
degree.
now,
section
1
of
that
act
provided
that
there
be
no
exclusive
right
or
a
special
right
in
the
fisheries
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
that
section
was
passed
with
--and
the
history
of
it
shows
that
it
was
passed
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
doing
away
with
some
administrative
orders
that
had
existed
prior
to
that
time
whereby
the
licensing
for
fishing
in
certain
areas
was
restricted
to
the
prior
licensees
which
is
basically
what
we're
confronted
with
in
this
subject
litigation,
a
revival
of
this
old
outlawed
provision
that
was
outlawed
by
the
white
act
back
in
1926.
now,
after
the
white
act
was
passed,
the
secretary
of
interior
who
had
a
subsequent
time
had
in
his
powers
the
regulations
of
the
fisheries
of
the
then
territory
of
alaska
provided
for
an
indian
reservation
called
the
carlock
indian
reservation
and
he
provided
in
that
same
regulation
that
the
fishing
in
the
waters
abutting
the
carlock
indian
reservation
would
be
restricted
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees,
in
other
words
the
indians
themselves
could
license
third
persons
to
fish
with
them
in
this
particular
area.
the
matter
was
tried
and
it
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
hynes
against
grimes
packing
company
in
the
337
u.s.
was
decided
in
1949.
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
provision
limiting
the
right
of
fishery
in
these
reservation
waters
even
though
the
promulgating
of
the
regulation
as
far
as
the
establishment
of
the
indian
was
upheld
that
the
secretary
could
not
limit
the
fishing
in
those
waters
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees
because
it
ran
above
of
the
white
act
provision
that
i
have
just
been
referring
to.
now,
this
is
the
background,
that
decision
was
made
in
1949.
in
1955,
prior
to
statehood,
alaska
held
a
constitutional
convention
and
at
that
constitutional
convention,
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
enacted
was
article
8
section
15
and
this
provides
for
a
regulation
or
restriction
on
the
regulation
of
fisheries
almost
identical
to
the
white.
the
provision
and
i
quote
from
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
is
that
“no
exclusive
right
or
special
privilege
of
fishery
should
be
created
or
authorized
in
the
natural
waters
of
the
state.”
and
i
would
like
with
your
honors
indulgence
to
read
the
comment
of
the
natural
resources
committee
of
the
constitutional
convention
as
to
why
they
enacted
that
particular
constitutional
provision
into
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
it
is
at
page
31.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
sir.
in
proposing
section
15
of
alaska
constitution,
the
natural
resources
committee
of
the
constitutional
convention
made
the
following
commentary,
no
exclusive
right
of
fishery.
this
section
is
intended
to
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
provision
prohibiting
the
several
right
of
fisheries
in
the
white
act.
instead
of
using
the
terminology
of
that
act,
the
purposes
sought
by
it
are
a
given
expression
in
a
prohibition
of
exclusive
right
or
special
privileges
of
any
person
to
the
fisheries
of
the
state,
and
that's
the
commentary
on
the
article
on
state
lands
and
natural
resources.
now,
your
honor
this
subsequently
was
adopted
as
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
alaska,
this
provision
as
a
part
of
the
constitution
when
the
constitution
--
when
alaska
was
admitted
to
statehood
in
1959.
and
as
i
have
explained
initially,
this
was
based
on
the
white
act
provision
and
the
purpose
of
that
white
act
provision
was
to
prevent
the
restriction
of
fishing
rights
to
those
who
had
had
those
rights
in
prior
years.
now,
we
have
had
unfortunately
in
alaska
quite
a
history
of
legislative
attempts
that
created
local
favoritism,
efforts
to
give
the
people
in
alaska
advantages
over
non
residence
particularly
and
even
as
to
residence
in
certain
areas
over
other
areas.
i
refer
to
the
case
of
smith
against
freemen
in
280
2d
u.s.
where
it
was
attempted
to
impose
a
$250.00
license
fee
for
non
resident
fisherman
as
opposed
to
a
$1.00
resident
fee.
mullaney
against
anderson
in
342
u.s.
where
they
attempted
a
$50.00
resident
license
fee
as
opposed
to
a
--
$50.00
non
resident
as
oppose
to
a
$5.00
resident
fee.
mr.
robert
boochever
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
robert
boochever
not
as
such,
no.
this
case
does
not
depend
on
none
residency
because
it
would
work
a
discrimination
as
to
residence
in
the
state
as
well
as
non
residence
and
that
it
restricts
it
to
specific
areas
in
the
state.
but
it
also
--
it
is
the
same
general
plan
to
give
an
advantage
to
the
local
fishermen.
that
is
an
unconstitutional
advantage.
in
brown
against
anderson,
the
attempt
was
made
to,
where
under
certain
hardship
conditions,
only
fisherman
of
a
local
area
could
fish
and
no
non
residents
could
come
in
to
fish.
in
the
last
year,
the
case
of
alaska
against
international
union
of
operating
engineers,
393
u.s.
involved
in
attempt
to
give
local
laborers
of
the
union
favoritism
over
non-resident
laborers.
and
it
is
our
position
your
honor
that
chapter
186
of
sla
1968,
which
is
the
legislation
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
comes
right
in
this
series
of
an
effort
to
create
a
local
monopoly
in
the
fishing
areas
of
alaska
to
those
who
had
prior
licenses
in
those
particular
areas.
now,
to
better
understand
the
nature
of
this
discrimination,
i
think
some
background
of
the
fishing
processes
and
the
nature
of
the
licenses
required
is
needed.
in
alaska,
any
fisherman
must
have
a
commercial
fishing
license,
every
fisherman
must
have
that.
in
addition
where
fishing
is
done
by
vessels
and
far
and
away,
the
large
amount
of
fishing
is
done
by
vessels,
there
must
be
a
vessel
license.
now,
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
issuance
of
the
commercial
fishing
license
or
the
vessel
license
but
there
is
a
third
thing
that
is
needed
for
the
almost
all
the
fishing
that's
done
in
alaska
and
that
is
a
salmon
net
gear
license,
and
it
is
by
what
we
consider
this
attempt
to
setup
a
monopoly
is
by
use
of
that
salmon
net
gear
license.
the
law
specifies
that
only
those
who
are
licensed
in
prior
years
in
a
specific
area
may
secure
a
salmon
net
gear
license
unless
he
fishes
commercially
for
three
years
in
that
specific
area.
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor,
no
it
does
not.
one
can
troll
without
a
salmon
net
gear
license.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
and
i
might
point
out
right
here
that
trolling
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
fishing,
it
uses
a
different
type
of
vessel.
in
trolling
a
line
is
hung
out
from
the
vessel,
only
four
lines
are
permitted.
mr.
robert
boochever
less
than
5%
are
caught
be
trollers,
95%
are
caught
by
the
net
fisherman;
this
appears
in
the
statistical
reports
of
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
that
is
also
true.
primarily,
the
fish
that
are
caught
by
troll
are
the
large
king
salmon
and
the
silver
pap
salmon
and
they
are
not
as
a
rule
used
in
the
canneries
which
can
the
other
salmons,
they
are
sent
to
the
eastern
market.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor,
the
principle,
there
is
suck
eye
and
pinks
and
shanks,
the
other
three
varieties.
mr.
robert
boochever
they
are
caught
by
gill
nets
and
by
sane
nets.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
and
for
instance,
in
bristol
bay
which
is
the,
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
the
areas
and
one
of
the,
one
of
the
most
valuable
ot
ther
which
the
largest
runs
of
fish
are
anticipated,
in
fact
they
anticipate
this
coming
year
that
there
will
be
37,000,000
fish
caught
in
bristol
bay
alone,
the
largest
run
they
anticipated
in
record.
and
in
that
area,
it
is
impossible
to
troll.
there
is
no
troll,
the
statistical
report
show
no
troll
caught
fish
and
it
is
well
known
and
the
district
judges
below
had
perfect
cognizance
of
this
that
you
could
drag
a
troll
line
through
there
day
in
and
day
out
and
you'd
never
catch
a
fish
because
of
the
salty
waters
and
the
fact
that
the
suck
eye
salmon
do
not
strike
in
those
waters,
they
will
hit
a
fly
up
in
the
stream
further
up
when
the
water
gets
fresh
but
they
wont
hit
the
troll
lures
and
there's
no
trolling
so
there's
no
way
of
getting
entry
into
this
valuable
fishery
unless
you're
in
the
favorite
class,
those
who
had
a
license
before
or
unless
one
can
secure
the
permission
of
one
of
those
licensees
to
fish
with
you.
in
other
words,
it
is
exactly
the
thing
that
was
prohibited
in
the
hynes
case
where
the
licenses
were
limited
to
the
carlock
indians
and
their
licensees.
in
the
hynes
case,
the
carlock
indians
had
authority
to
let
other
people
get
into
the
field
and
issue
licenses.
in
the
subject
case
for
instance
in
bristol
bay,
there
are
two
gear
net
fishermen
usually
to
a
vessel
and
one
owns
the
gear
and
if
you
can't
his
permission
to
fish
with
you
and
you
can't
a
gear
license,
you're
frozen
out
of
the
field,
you
can't
fish
at
all
and
this
of
course
is
the
exact
provision
that
was
involved
in
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
of
article
8
section
15
which
prohibited
the
use
of,
the
exclusive
right
or
special
privilege
in
the
fisheries
and
which
was
interpreted
prior
to
the
adoption
of
alaska
constitution
by
the
supreme
court
in
hynes
against
grimes
packing.
and
i
might
add
that
at
the
time
that
that
was
passed
by
hynes
against
grimes
packing,
we
not
have
only
had
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land,
the
supreme
court,
but
at
that
time,
it
was
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
that
is
the
territory
because
their
territory
had
a
district
court
which
was
a
district
court
for
the
territory
of
alaska
and
it
had
a
joint
function
as
a
territorial
court
and
in
effect
federal
court.
there
was
no
territorial
appellant
court,
the
appeals
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
to
the
supreme
court.
so
we
have
a
clear
decision
on
a
constitutional
provision
not
only
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
but
the
highest
court
of
what
was
then
the
state
and
we
might
--
i
might
add
that
alaska,
the
alaska
supreme
court
has
held
that
when
a
statute
is
adopted
from
another
jurisdiction,
it
takes
with
it
the
construction
placed
on
that
statute
by
the
highest
court
of
that
jurisdiction,
i
refer
to
the
case
of
(inaudible)
against
lathrop
company
in
that
regard.
now,
we
feel
that
not
only
is
this
violative
as
i
have
shown
and
clearly
so
with
a
supreme
court
decision
on
it
already
of
the
federal
constitutional
issues,
of
the
state
constitutional
issues
but
it
also
is
a
discrimination
based
purely
on
past
fishing
efforts
and
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
that
regard,
we
feel
that
the
case
of
takahashi
against
fishing
gain
commission
in
340
34
u.s.
is
very
much
in
point.
as
your
honors,
will
recall
in
that
case,
the
state
of
california
prohibited
fishing
by
certain
aliens
and
in
expressing
their
reason,
they
gave
very
much
the
same
reason
as
my
learned
colleague
here
has
given
today
that
this
was
a
conservation
method.
that
there
was
too
much
gear
in
the
waters
of
california
and
then
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
conserve
fishing
to
reduce
the
amount
of
gear
and
therefore
to
eliminate
certain
aliens
from
the
fishery.
and
this
learned
court
of
course
held
that
that
was
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
even
though
the
purpose
was
a
justifiable
purpose
assuming
it
was
a
justifiable
purpose
that
of
conservation.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
i
think
the
cache
(ph)
case
your
honor
as
stated
in
the
opinion.
there
is
a
unique
case
and
in
fact
they
stated
there
that
one
shouldn't
hypothesize
about
any
other
facts
from
it.
in
that
case,
the
river
boat
pilots
where
officers
of
the
state
itself
and
there
were
only
a
very
limited
number
of
those
positions
available
and
so
under
that
rather
--
that
unique
situation,
it
was
upheld
in
a
divided
decision.
so
that
i
don't
think
the
cache
case
is
applicable
at
all
to
the
situation
which
--
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes,
that
is
so
your
honor.
however,
in
this
subject
case,
what
there
is,
is
in
the
recitation
of
the
statute.
there
is
a
statement
that
experience
plays
a
part
in
management,
in
safety
and
in
law
enforcement.
and
we
served
interrogatories
on
the
state
requesting
any
examples
they
could
give
where
this
was
a
factor.
experience,
i
might
add
in
the
particular
area
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
all
experienced
fishermen
who
have
fished
to
great
deal.
but
they
have
been
denied
the
right
to
fish
in
the
particular
area.
in
answer
to
those
interrogatories,
the
state
was
able
to
furnish
no
example
of
any
one
of
those
areas
where
experience
had
played
a
part.
and
of
course
this
has
come
before
the
court
below
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes,
your
honor
it
was
and
as
i
stated,
they
were
--
there
was
a
very
--
there
were
very
few
people,
they
could
be
in
any
event
employed
as
river
boat
pilots
and
they
were
officers
of
the
state
itself
and
it
was
a
unique
situation
in
that
instance.
mr.
robert
boochever
not
as
such
as
related
to
fishing
in
a
particular
area.
there
is
the
--
certainly
as
i
would
say
a
certain
degree
that
experience
in
any
field
helps
and
certainly
experiences
a
boat
man
would
give
some
experience
to
tort
safety
and
navigating
a
boat.
i
couldn't
deny
that.
but
as
far
as
a
fisherman
who
has
fished
for
instance
in
southeastern
alaska,
where
that
one
area
is
as
large
as
all
the
new
england
states
and
it
has
a
tremendous
shoreline.
well,
the
fisherman
there,
each
fish
in
their
own
little
favorite
harbors
and
their
experience
there
would
give
them
as
far
as
fishing
in
the
rest
of
the
area
is
just
the
same
as
their
experience
fishing
in
bristol
bay
or
somewhere
else
would
be.
so
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
valid
criteria.
however,
i'm
not
arguing
that
point
assuming
that
it
is.
in
this
particular
case,
they
should
not
exclude
based
on
the
past
right
and
then
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
that
exclusive
right
to
decide
who
will
come
in
because
no
one
can
fish
without
fishing
with
the
gear
licensees.
incidentally
your
honors
asked
as
to
what
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
your
honor.
what
i
mean
is
that
in
order
to
fish,
they
have
to
get
the
consent
of
one
of
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
to
fish
commercially
with
a
net,
one
does.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
here
let
me
give
the
example
again
in
bristol
bay.
mr.
robert
boochever
you
can't
troll
in
bristol
bay.
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
i
guess
one
could
do
that.
but
of
course
--
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
you
can
fish
without
catching
fish
if
that's
your
honor
but
that
to
me
is
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no.
there
are
number
of
other
areas
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
but
this
would
eliminate
one
from
fishing
in
the
bristol
bay
area
which
is
in
itself
at
times
as
much
as
half
the
fish
from
the
whole
state.
mr.
robert
boochever
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
this
applies
also
to
each
of
the
areas
independently.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
relationship
between
trolling
which
is
the
one
example
that's
been
given.
there
is
no
relationship
between
trolling
and
same
fishing
or
net
fishing.
mr.
robert
boochever
your
honor,
in
some
of
the
areas,
one
can
fish
for
other
fish
besides
salmon.
for
instance
in
southeast
there
is
--
mr.
robert
boochever
in
bristol
bay
to
my
knowledge,
the
salmon
fishery
would
be
the
only
fishery
but
i
could
not
say
that
categorically.
that
is
my
--
mr.
robert
boochever
well
your
honor
the
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
not
your
honor
because
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
my
feeling
would
be
that
if
you
have
a
man
who
has
fished
commercially
in
one
area
and
he
has
shown
his
knowledge
and
he's
fished
there.
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
be
discriminated
against
in
fishing
in
another
area
whereby
his
only
means
of
entering
that
field
is
by
the
grace
of
the
licensee
or
else
he
is
subjected
to
leaving
his
vessel,
his
gear
and
try
to
gain
employment
there
or
else
to
do
as
in
the
case
of
the
salmon
fishery
in
bristol
bay,
a
feudal
act
for
three
years.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
i
do
not
your
honor.
not
under
the
state
constitutional
provision.
the
state
constitutional
provision
is
expressed
on
--
mr.
robert
boochever
no
exclusive
right
of
fishing.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
i
do
not
believe
it
does
your
honor.
now,
this
is
a
more
difficult
question.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
say
a
lottery
as
to
whether
this
would
be
permissible.
i
would
say
that's
a
more
difficult
question
under
the
state
constitution
that
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
boochever
of
limiting
the
number
of
fishermen?
yes
your
honor.
it
did
limit
the
number
of
fishermen
but
by
an
unconstitutional
way.
now
--
mr.
robert
boochever
in
answer
to
mr.
--
excuse
me,
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
white
further
if
i
may.
with
reference
to
the
regulation
under
the
state
constitutional
provision,
there
are
number
of
means
that
are
permissible.
they
may
reduce
the
number
of
hours
that
fishing
is
permitted.
they
may
reduce
the
number
of
areas
where
it's
permitted.
they
may
reduce
the
size
of
the
gear
that's
permitted
but
they
can't
create
an
exclusive
or
special
right
in
certain
people
to
fish
in
the
areas.
and
this
is
what
they
have
attempted
to
do
here.
that's
in
our
opinion,
a
clear
violation.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
robert
boochever
i
would
agree
with
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
although
not
under
the
state
exclusive
right
of
fishery
clause.
i
would
agree
that
that
is
the
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
no.
mr.
robert
boochever
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
would
effect
it.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
more
fisherman
and
they
reduced
the
hours
to
such
a
few
hours
that
it
was
uneconomical
to
fish,
then
they're
going
to
have
to
drop
out
of
the
field.
mr.
robert
boochever
it
would
be
more
or
less
on
that
basis.
i
would
say
your
honor
but
this
is
what
was
passed
as
part
of
the
alaska
constitution
and
knowingly
passed
with
the
idea
of
preventing,
giving
any
exclusive
right
to
any
group
in
the
fishery.
mr.
robert
boochever
no,
i
don't
believe
they
are
at
this
time
your
honor.
the
forecast
as
i
mentioned
for
this
coming
year
is
for
the
largest
run
in
the
history
since
the
19th
century.
they
anticipate
over
14
million
fish
in
bristol
bay
alone.
i'm
referring
to
the
bristol
bay
fishery,
it
varies
a
great
deal.
and
one
year,
you'll
have
a
good
run
in
southeastern
alaska.
another
year,
it
will
be
a
good
run
in
bristol
bay
and
the
forecast
this
year
is
for
the
greatest
in
history,
so
that
i
don't
think
we
can
say
it's
a
dwindling
resource
and
it
appears
that
it
is
on
the
upgrade
under
the
state
management
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
boochever
no
your
honor
because
the
--
most
of
the
facts,
which
i
have
stated
are
matters
that
are
so
well
known
in
alaska
that
they
are
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge.
mr.
robert
boochever
well,
it
is
difficult.
i
must
admit
to
talk
to
someone
who
is
not
been
in
the
particular
area.
but
our
district
judges,
two
of
the
district
judges
are
long
time
alaska
residents
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
alaska
fishery
and
were
able
to
take
notice
of
what
the
actual
facts
are
in
the
fishery.
secondly,
there
was
no
statement
of
issues
made
by
my
learned
colleague
raising
any
issues
of
fact.
we
brought
up
our
position
initially
in
this
case
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
complaint
and
they
never
as
required
by
the
district
court
rules
for
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
alaska
set
forth
a
factual
issue
challenging
our
position
until
our
oral
argument
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
below
and
in
their
briefs
before
this
court.
now,
i
would
like
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
to
address
myself
to
the
abstention
problem.
in
this
case,
as
i
have
stated,
we
have
a
supreme
court
decision
on
the
alaska
constitutional
issue.
we
have
a
clear
history
of
that
alaska
constitutional
issue.
there
is
therefore
no
reason
why
the
lower
court
should
abstain,
should
have
abstained
because
of
that
issue.
we
had
every
right
to
be
in
the
federal
court
under
diversity
of
citizenship
and
because
of
the
admittedly
substantial
federal
question
that's
involved.
and
so
--
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor
it
does.
mr.
robert
boochever
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
boochever
so,
we
are
there
on
both
reasons,
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute,
no
question
but
that
these
plaintiffs
were
denied
the
fishing
right
under
the
statute.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
alaska
constitution
has
been
construed
by
the
higher
state
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
land
and
therefore
there
is
no
reason
for
application
of
the
unusual
doctrine
of
abstention.
thank
you
your
honor.
