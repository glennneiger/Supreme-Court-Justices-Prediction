mr.
charles
k.
cranston
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
resolution
of
issues
concerned
with
the
regulation
of
a
basic
industry
of
the
state
of
alaska,
its
fishing
resource,
and
in
particular
it
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
applicants
maybe
awarded
net
gear
licenses
to
fish
for
salmon
in
alaska.
the
statute
which
is
here
under
attack
was
passed
by
the
1968
legislature
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
requires
that
a
licensee
in
order
to
be
awarded
a
salmon
net
gear
fishing
license
must
either
have
been
licensed
as
a
net
gear
licensee
in
the
area
in
which
he
wishes
to
fish
or
that
he
was
actively
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
for
three
years
in
the
area
in
which
he
desires
to
be
licensed.
the
appellees
sought
to
have
the
statute
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
light
of
certain
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
in
the
light
of
certain
provisions
of
the
state
of
alaska
constitution.
the
state
of
alaska
constitutional
provisions
require
that
there
shall
be
granted
no
exclusive
right
or
privilege
of
fishery
and
that
the
fishery
source
is
reserved
to
all
of
the
people
for
their
common
use.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
anchorage
alaska
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
two
alaska
constitutional
provisions
to
which
i
have
referred.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
alaska
that
summary
judgment
was
improperly
granted
in
this
case
and
that
the
basic
issue
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
provision
allowing
new
entrants
into
the
salmon
fishery
by
virtue
of
their
right
to
fish
commercially
for
three
years
is
--
the
issue
is
whether
this
is
illusory,
whether
it
is
meaningless
or
not.
the
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
not
withstanding
the
provision,
entry
into
the
fishery
was
controlled
not
by
the
state
as
intended
by
the
statute
but
by
the
fisherman
themselves.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
this
conclusion
of
the
three-judge
court
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
and
for
that
reason,
summary
judgment
should
not
have
been
granted
on
the
record
as
it
appeared
before
the
court
at
that
time.
the
allegations
in
the
pleadings
relative
to
this
aspect
of
the
case
were
denied
and
the
pertinent
affidavits
and
answers
to
interrogatories
did
not
touch
on
the
issue
although
the
court
itself
found
that
there
is
no
right
of
new
entry
other
than
by
the
permission
of
those
already
in
the
fishery.
it
is
necessary
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
court
in
the
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
in
fact,
for
a
person
to
be
illegible
for
a
salmon
net
gear
license
in
alaska,
he
had
to
receive
employment
by
those
already
engaged
in
the
fishery
and
therefore
the
right
to
his
license
was
not
within
his
control
but
was
with
in
the
control
of
others.
and
on
this
basis
the
court
concluded
the
fishery
in
effect
was
closed,
there
was
and
exclusive
right
and
the
right
was
not
open
to
all
who
might
wish
to
enter.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
state
contest
its
finding
mr.
justice,
on
the
basis
that
it
is
not
supported
by
any
facts
presently
in
the
record
or
by
any
implications
which
could
be
drawn
from
those
facts
in
the
record
and
we
feel
that
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
also
was
a
license
to
be
issued
to
one
who
fishes
commercially
for
three
years
is
sufficient
in
allowing
new
entry
into
the
fishery.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
no
mr.
justice.
the
statute
says
only
that
a
license
maybe
issued
to
one
who
has
fished
actively
as
a
commercial
licensee
for
three
years.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
or
has
had
a
salmon
license
in
any
year
in
the
particular
area.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes
mr.
justice.
i
would
assume
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
made
its
finding
that,
and
determine
that
the
application
of
the
law
resulted
in
this
and
this
of
course
is
the
very
point
which
i
am
arguing
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
determine
that
this
is
how
the
law
operates
in
application,
then
more
facts
are
needed.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
stating
yes,
one
can
fish
commercially
in
alaska
for
fish
other
than
salmon
and
this
is
done
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
again,
this
is
off
the
--
this
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
but
i
would
assume
that
there
are
people
who
make
a
living
fishing
for
halibut,
fishing
for
cramp.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
although
this
again
gets
to
my
basic
point
that
in
order
to
determine
to
answer
your
question
sir,
there
would
have
to
be
hearings
at
the
district
court
level
in
order
to
answer
this
question.
i
believe
the
state
would
agree
that
others
may
make
a
living
at
fishing
commercially
for
fish
other
than
salmon.
appellees
of
course
assert
that
maybe
they
can't
make
a
living
and
this
is
something
that
should
be
determined
in
plenary
proceedings.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
if
he
has
while
working
for
the
salmon,
i
suppose
the
boat
owner
or
somebody
who
has
the
gear,
if
he
has
worked
while
licensed
as
a
commercial
fisherman
which
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
generally
i
would
--
i
think
you
do
your
honor
in
order
to
engage
in
the
activity
of
fishing.
one
would
have
to
have
a
commercial
fishing
license
and
the
issuance
of
such
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
if
that
employee
is
in
fact
fishing,
he
would
have
to
have
a
commercial
fishing
license
and
the
license
--
the
issuance
of
that
license
is
not
restricted,
he
pays
depending
on
whether
he's
a
resident
or
non
resident
at
$10.00
fee
or
a
$30.00
fee.
and
upon
payment
of
the
fee
can
be
issued
the
license.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
law
does
require
that
you
fish.
it
states
that
the
licensee
must
have
been
actively
engaged
in
the
activity
of
commercial
fishing
and
there
are
other
statutory
requirements
which
require
that
a
perspective
licensee
furnish
affidavits
to
this
effect
that
he
has
actively
engaged
in
the
fishery
for
each
of
those
years.
i
believe
that
the
very
questions
which
have
been
asked
indicate
that
in
order
to
determine
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
fishery
involved
that
there
are
questions
which
have
not
been
resolved
and
which
should
have
been
resolved
prior
to
the
lower
court's
awarding
summary
judgment.
this
case
is
a
clear
example
of
the
proposition
that
important
constitutional
questions
are
usually
not
appropriate
for
summary
judgment.
appellees
themselves
have
cited
the
case,
england
versus
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners
which
contains
the
“it
is
the
typical,
not
the
rare
case
in
which
constitutional
claims
turn
upon
the
resolution
of
contested
factual
issues.”
and
i
would
assert
that
this
is
the
typical
case
involving
an
important
constitutional
question
for
the
state
of
alaska
and
that
there
are
contested
factual
issues
remaining
and
certainly
the
conclusion
of
the
court
should
not
rest
upon
such
an
inadequate
factual
basis.
i
would
give
some
examples
of
the
inadequate
factual
basis.
the
appellees
state
that
the
new
entry
provisions
are
illusory
and
whether
they
are
illusory
depends
upon
facts
which
they
have
set
forth
in
their
statement
of
facts
much
of
which
did
not
appear
as
the
record
in
the
lower
court.
for
instance,
it
is
possible
for
one
to
engage
in
salmon
fishing
as
a
commercial
licensee
and
troll,
trolling
is
an
activity
which
does
not
require
salmon
net
gear,
it
is
commercial
fishing,
it
is
salmon
fishing.
the
relationship
of
this
activity
to
the
application
of
the
statute
has
not
been
investigated
by
the
lower
court
and
is
not
on
record
at
this
time
in
order
for
this
court
to
investigate.
also,
appellees
assert
that
the
unique
effect
of
11
salmon
registration
areas
in
alaska
prohibits
easy
movement
of
commercial
salmon
fisherman
from
one
area
to
another
area
with
the
statutory
prohibition.
we
will
agree
that
there
are
11
salmon
fishing
registration
areas
but
we
will
not
agree
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings
that
the
effect
of
those
regulations
on
the
statute
prohibits
free
movement
of
fisherman
from
one
area
to
the
other
to
their
economic
detriment
as
appellees
assert.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
alaska,
the
coastline
in
which
the
salmon
fishery
is
engaged
covers
approximately
3000
or
3500
miles
from
southeast
alaska
near
ketchikan
up
through
near
the
artic
ocean.
the
coastline
is
segmented
into
11
districts
based
generally
upon
geography,
the
coastline,
the
types
of
bays
involved
and
perhaps
based
upon
the
species
of
fish
which
appear
in
those
areas.
and
when
one
acquires
a
license
to
fish
for
salmon
in
alaska,
he
is
licensed
only
for
one
of
those
11
areas
and
if
during
one
season
he
acquires
a
license
for
let's
say
the
southeast
alaskan
area,
he
may
not
then
fish
in
the
bristol
bay
area,
he
is
limited
to
a
particular
area
during
each
season
and
appellees
assert
that
the
statute
coupled
with
the
area
requirement
in
effect
closes
the
class
of
those
who
may
engage
in
the
commercial
salmon
fishery.
we
would
assert
that
in
order
to
reach
this
decision,
this
conclusion,
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
entire
aspect
of
the
areas
involved
bares
further
investigation.
they're
simply
not
enough
at
this
point
to
reach
the
appellees
conclusion.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
my
point
is
that
if
a
fisherman
is
licensed
in
southeast
alaska
as
a
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
one
of
the
11
areas,
that
the
very
fact
that
he
has
to
acquire
a
license
to
fish
in
bristol
bay
in
some
other
year
and
that
fact
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
right.
if
he
wishes
to
fish
in
bristol
bay
in
a
year
other
than
the
year
in
which
he
is
licensed
in
southeast
alaska,
he
must
comply
with
the
statute
and
fish
commercially
three
years
prior
to
acquiring
a
salmon
net
gear
license
in
a
new
area
or
he
must
have
been
licensed
in
that
area.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yeah,
my
point
is
that
the
deprivation
of
his
right
to
fish
based
upon
the
application
of
the
area
requirement
is
not
necessarily
clear
from
the
state
of
the
record
as
it
appeared
in
the
lower
court.
the
effect
upon
the
area
requirement,
say
upon
his
right
to
use
his
vessel
upon
the
right
to
use
his
gear
to
his
economic
detriment
is
not
necessarily
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court
record
and
that
if
he
in
fact
is
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
fishing
vessel
or
of
the
right
to
fish
in
any
particular
area
because
of
the
area
requirement,
that
conclusion
cannot
be
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
appears
in
this
court.
i
believe
that
the
questions
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
district
court
did
not
discuss
this
ground
too
heavily
mr.
justice.
the
appellees
have
argued
this
ground
quite
heavily
in
their
brief
and
i
would
assert
that
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
appellees
may
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
their
vessels
during
any
particular
salmon
fishing
season
because
of
the
area
requirement
is
not
supported
by
the
record
at
the
present
time.
the
main
point
i
am
attempting
to
make
is
that
the
fishery
regulation
in
alaska
is
extremely
complex
involving
areas
of
differing
types
of
salmon,
differing
weather
conditions,
differing
sea
conditions
and
that
at
the
stage
in
which
the
district
court
reached
its
conclusion,
none
of
this
particular
factors
had
been
investigated
by
the
court.
the
second
point
which
the
state
of
alaska
is
urging
is
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
completely
from
reaching
a
conclusion
in
this
case.
the
basis
for
our
argument
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
is
due
to
the
fact
that
appellees
asserted
that
the
statute
violated
unique
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution,
those
provisions
are
as
i
have
stated
that
no
exclusive
right
of
fishery
should
be
granted
and
that
the
fishery
source
is
reserved
to
the
people
for
their
common
use.
these
provisions
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
are
unique
among
the
state
constitutions
and
no
constitution
contains
language
similar
to
that
of
alaska
and
therefore,
the
interpretation
of
these
provisions
have
not
been
resolved
by
any
court
of
any
state
including
alaska.
generally,
there
are
three
grounds
upon
which
abstention
maybe
granted
and
three
grounds
which
support
the
requirement
that
a
district
court
abstain
from
deciding
federal
questions.
first,
abstention
should
be
granted
to
avoid
a
decision
involving
federal
constitutional
grounds
where
the
state
law
may
resolve
the
question.
this
of
course
is
applicable
to
this
case
and
that
the
application
of
the
exclusive
right
of
fishery
provision
of
the
alaska
constitution
could
resolve
this
case
without
the
necessity
of
deciding
a
federal
constitutional
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
also,
abstention
has
been
required
to
avoid
needless
conflict
with
the
state's
administration
of
its
own
resource
and
its
own
affairs.
this
is
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
state's
police
power
should
be
the
proper
means
to
regulate
a
resource.
the
appellees
would
assert
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
so
clear
on
its
face
that
it
needs
no
further
interpretation
and
certainly
needs
no
interpretation
in
the
light
of
the
state's
police
power.
i
would
assert
that
this
is
not
true
and
an
example
would
make
this
point
clear.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
i
believe
it's
quoted
at
the
very
beginning
under
constitutional
provisions
on
page
3.
i've
set
out
the
two
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution
which
are
involved.
every
constitution
contains
the
requirement
that
no
state
shall
impair
the
obligation
of
contract.
however,
this
court
has
ruled
that
a
state
may
in
fact
impair
the
obligation
of
contract
pursuant
to
a
valid
exercise
of
its
police
power.
i
would
assert
that
in
this
case,
the
state
of
alaska
may
create
if
necessary
in
the
valid
exercise
of
its
police
power
and
exclusive
right
of
fishery,
the
extent
to
which
it
may
do
this
should
be
determined
by
a
court
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
should
not
have
been
determined
by
the
federal
district
court
of
alaska.
these
provisions
as
i
have
said
have
not
been
interpreted
by
any
state
court.
appellees
assert
that
the
case
of
hynes
versus
grimes
packing
company
which
interpreted
similar
federal
statutory
provision
during
territorial
days
is
determinative
of
this
case.
however,
in
the
hynes
case,
the
secretary
of
interior
had
granted
an
exclusive
right
of
fishery
over
a
particular
area
to
a
particular
native
village.
there
is
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
justify
his
granting
of
this
right
pursuant
to
any
conservation
purpose
or
other
regulatory
police
power
purpose.
in
this
case
of
course,
the
state
of
alaska
has
recognized
that
the
accumulation
of
excessive
net
gear
has
resulted
in
an
over
harvest
of
the
fishery
and
has
created
severe
management
and
enforcement
problems.
this
is
quite
different
from
the
case
of
hynes
where
there
was
no
regulation
of
this
type
involved.
lastly,
the
appellees
have
asserted
that
the
industry
of
fishing
is
a
common
calling
and
as
such
is
apparently
immune,
from
state
regulation
of
this
sort.
the
mere
fact
that
industry
is
called
the
common
calling
does
not
remove
it
from
state
regulation
if
that
regulation
is
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
a
resource
to
rectify
management
and
enforcement
problems
with
that
resource.
this
has
been
done
in
the
past
at
common
law
at
such
economic
pursuits
as
the
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages
or
the
transportation
of
people
for
hire
were
considered
common
callings.
however,
at
the
present
stage,
these
activities
are
heavily
regulated
by
the
states
and
quite
often
certificates
of
public
convenience
a
necessity
are
required.
there
is
no
reason
why
salmon
fishing
especially
with
net
gear
should
be
removed
from
state
regulation
simply
because
it
is
connoted
as
being
a
common
calling.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
disagree
with
the
construction
of
the
alaska
court.
i'm
asking
that
the
court
should
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
be
held
pending
the
determination
of
the
unique
alaska
constitutional
provisions
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
law
by
an
alaska
court.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
one
other
answer
would
be
that
at
the
present
stage
of
the
record,
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
is
not
necessarily
--
does
not
necessarily
reach
the
result
that
that
provision
has
violated.
i
don't
believe
there
is
enough
in
the
present
stage
of
the
record
to
reach
that
conclusion.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
depending
on
--
depending
upon
the
position
that
this
court
takes
in
its
application
of
the
abstention
doctrine.
first,
the
doctrine
has
been
characteristically
applied
in
order
to
avoid
the
reaching
of
a
federal
constitutional
decision
if
the
matter
could
be
resolved
by
the
application
of
a
state
constitutional
provision.
also,
i
would
urge
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional
under
federal
constitutional
provision.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
and
that
there
was
nothing
before
the
court
sufficient
to
justify
its
conclusion
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
none.
this
statute
has
not
been
interpreted
by
an
alaska
court
so
far
as
i
know
it
at
any
level.
the
only
litigation
involving
the
statute
has
been
this
case
which
commenced
in
the
federal
district
court
in
anchorage
and
again,
this
points
up
my
claim
that
since
we
are
involved
with
a
highly
complex
industry,
unique
constitutional
provisions
that
it
is
appropriate
for
state
court
determination.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
black,
the
alaska
court
could
decide
although
the
state
would
naturally
fight
the
issue
heavily
in
the
state
court
but
it
is
possible
that
it
could
reach
a
decision
that
the
statute
is
in
violation
of
the
exclusive
right
and
common
privilege
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution.
if
that
were
so
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
if
that
were
so,
that
would
knock
the
entire
statute
out
since
the
provisions
do
not
apply
themselves
piece
meal
across
the
statute
if
it
is
unconstitutional
under
state
law,
the
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
determine
in
the
light
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
there'd
certainly
be
no
advantage
to
the
state
if
that
were
the
conclusion
of
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
however
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
this
is
one
of
the
attacks.
however,
mr.
justice,
the
state
at
this
point
is
asserting
that
if
it
were
afforded
a
complete
hearing
at
the
state
court
level
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
provisions
that
it
could
prove
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
state
court.
in
other
words,
we
feel
that
given
a
fair
hearing
in
plenary
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
we
could
show
that
the
statute
is
a
valid
application
of
the
state's
police
power
under
those
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
this
under
that
result
--
this
would
be
possible
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that
would
be
a
fact
that
if
the
state
court
resolved
that
the
statute
was
constitutional,
the
federal
question
would
remain
for
decision.
however,
there
have
been
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
my
theory
on
this
mr.
justice,
under
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
england
versus
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
the
federal
question
should
be
reserved
in
the
federal
court
for
its
determination
that
the
state
court
should
not
determine
if
there's
the
abstention
doctrine,
should
not
determine
the
alaska,
should
not
determine
the
federal
provisions.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
they
may.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
they
may
do
this
if
they,
they
are
not
required
to
do
so
mr.
justice
as
i
read
england
correctly.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
obtain
the
position
that
this
court
should
not
decide
the
equal
protection
issue
since
there's
not
enough
before
it
to
decide
that
issue.
i
believe
on
that
point
that,
the
record
should
be
supplemented
by
further
hearings
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
and
there
might
not
be
a
decision
against
us
if
we
are
afforded
a
full
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
resolution
of
issues
concerned
with
the
regulation
of
a
basic
industry
of
the
state
of
alaska,
its
fishing
resource,
and
in
particular
it
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
applicants
maybe
awarded
net
gear
licenses
to
fish
for
salmon
in
alaska.
the
statute
which
is
here
under
attack
was
passed
by
the
1968
legislature
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
requires
that
a
licensee
in
order
to
be
awarded
a
salmon
net
gear
fishing
license
must
either
have
been
licensed
as
a
net
gear
licensee
in
the
area
in
which
he
wishes
to
fish
or
that
he
was
actively
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
for
three
years
in
the
area
in
which
he
desires
to
be
licensed.
the
appellees
sought
to
have
the
statute
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
light
of
certain
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
in
the
light
of
certain
provisions
of
the
state
of
alaska
constitution.
the
state
of
alaska
constitutional
provisions
require
that
there
shall
be
granted
no
exclusive
right
or
privilege
of
fishery
and
that
the
fishery
source
is
reserved
to
all
of
the
people
for
their
common
use.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
anchorage
alaska
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
two
alaska
constitutional
provisions
to
which
i
have
referred.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
alaska
that
summary
judgment
was
improperly
granted
in
this
case
and
that
the
basic
issue
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
provision
allowing
new
entrants
into
the
salmon
fishery
by
virtue
of
their
right
to
fish
commercially
for
three
years
is
--
the
issue
is
whether
this
is
illusory,
whether
it
is
meaningless
or
not.
the
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
not
withstanding
the
provision,
entry
into
the
fishery
was
controlled
not
by
the
state
as
intended
by
the
statute
but
by
the
fisherman
themselves.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
this
conclusion
of
the
three-judge
court
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
and
for
that
reason,
summary
judgment
should
not
have
been
granted
on
the
record
as
it
appeared
before
the
court
at
that
time.
the
allegations
in
the
pleadings
relative
to
this
aspect
of
the
case
were
denied
and
the
pertinent
affidavits
and
answers
to
interrogatories
did
not
touch
on
the
issue
although
the
court
itself
found
that
there
is
no
right
of
new
entry
other
than
by
the
permission
of
those
already
in
the
fishery.
it
is
necessary
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
court
in
the
three-judge
district
court
concluded
that
in
fact,
for
a
person
to
be
illegible
for
a
salmon
net
gear
license
in
alaska,
he
had
to
receive
employment
by
those
already
engaged
in
the
fishery
and
therefore
the
right
to
his
license
was
not
within
his
control
but
was
with
in
the
control
of
others.
and
on
this
basis
the
court
concluded
the
fishery
in
effect
was
closed,
there
was
and
exclusive
right
and
the
right
was
not
open
to
all
who
might
wish
to
enter.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
state
contest
its
finding
mr.
justice,
on
the
basis
that
it
is
not
supported
by
any
facts
presently
in
the
record
or
by
any
implications
which
could
be
drawn
from
those
facts
in
the
record
and
we
feel
that
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
also
was
a
license
to
be
issued
to
one
who
fishes
commercially
for
three
years
is
sufficient
in
allowing
new
entry
into
the
fishery.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
no
mr.
justice.
the
statute
says
only
that
a
license
maybe
issued
to
one
who
has
fished
actively
as
a
commercial
licensee
for
three
years.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
or
has
had
a
salmon
license
in
any
year
in
the
particular
area.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes
mr.
justice.
i
would
assume
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
made
its
finding
that,
and
determine
that
the
application
of
the
law
resulted
in
this
and
this
of
course
is
the
very
point
which
i
am
arguing
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
determine
that
this
is
how
the
law
operates
in
application,
then
more
facts
are
needed.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
stating
yes,
one
can
fish
commercially
in
alaska
for
fish
other
than
salmon
and
this
is
done
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
again,
this
is
off
the
--
this
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record
but
i
would
assume
that
there
are
people
who
make
a
living
fishing
for
halibut,
fishing
for
cramp.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
although
this
again
gets
to
my
basic
point
that
in
order
to
determine
to
answer
your
question
sir,
there
would
have
to
be
hearings
at
the
district
court
level
in
order
to
answer
this
question.
i
believe
the
state
would
agree
that
others
may
make
a
living
at
fishing
commercially
for
fish
other
than
salmon.
appellees
of
course
assert
that
maybe
they
can't
make
a
living
and
this
is
something
that
should
be
determined
in
plenary
proceedings.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
if
he
has
while
working
for
the
salmon,
i
suppose
the
boat
owner
or
somebody
who
has
the
gear,
if
he
has
worked
while
licensed
as
a
commercial
fisherman
which
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
generally
i
would
--
i
think
you
do
your
honor
in
order
to
engage
in
the
activity
of
fishing.
one
would
have
to
have
a
commercial
fishing
license
and
the
issuance
of
such
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
if
that
employee
is
in
fact
fishing,
he
would
have
to
have
a
commercial
fishing
license
and
the
license
--
the
issuance
of
that
license
is
not
restricted,
he
pays
depending
on
whether
he's
a
resident
or
non
resident
at
$10.00
fee
or
a
$30.00
fee.
and
upon
payment
of
the
fee
can
be
issued
the
license.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
law
does
require
that
you
fish.
it
states
that
the
licensee
must
have
been
actively
engaged
in
the
activity
of
commercial
fishing
and
there
are
other
statutory
requirements
which
require
that
a
perspective
licensee
furnish
affidavits
to
this
effect
that
he
has
actively
engaged
in
the
fishery
for
each
of
those
years.
i
believe
that
the
very
questions
which
have
been
asked
indicate
that
in
order
to
determine
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
fishery
involved
that
there
are
questions
which
have
not
been
resolved
and
which
should
have
been
resolved
prior
to
the
lower
court's
awarding
summary
judgment.
this
case
is
a
clear
example
of
the
proposition
that
important
constitutional
questions
are
usually
not
appropriate
for
summary
judgment.
appellees
themselves
have
cited
the
case,
england
versus
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners
which
contains
the
“it
is
the
typical,
not
the
rare
case
in
which
constitutional
claims
turn
upon
the
resolution
of
contested
factual
issues.”
and
i
would
assert
that
this
is
the
typical
case
involving
an
important
constitutional
question
for
the
state
of
alaska
and
that
there
are
contested
factual
issues
remaining
and
certainly
the
conclusion
of
the
court
should
not
rest
upon
such
an
inadequate
factual
basis.
i
would
give
some
examples
of
the
inadequate
factual
basis.
the
appellees
state
that
the
new
entry
provisions
are
illusory
and
whether
they
are
illusory
depends
upon
facts
which
they
have
set
forth
in
their
statement
of
facts
much
of
which
did
not
appear
as
the
record
in
the
lower
court.
for
instance,
it
is
possible
for
one
to
engage
in
salmon
fishing
as
a
commercial
licensee
and
troll,
trolling
is
an
activity
which
does
not
require
salmon
net
gear,
it
is
commercial
fishing,
it
is
salmon
fishing.
the
relationship
of
this
activity
to
the
application
of
the
statute
has
not
been
investigated
by
the
lower
court
and
is
not
on
record
at
this
time
in
order
for
this
court
to
investigate.
also,
appellees
assert
that
the
unique
effect
of
11
salmon
registration
areas
in
alaska
prohibits
easy
movement
of
commercial
salmon
fisherman
from
one
area
to
another
area
with
the
statutory
prohibition.
we
will
agree
that
there
are
11
salmon
fishing
registration
areas
but
we
will
not
agree
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings
that
the
effect
of
those
regulations
on
the
statute
prohibits
free
movement
of
fisherman
from
one
area
to
the
other
to
their
economic
detriment
as
appellees
assert.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
alaska,
the
coastline
in
which
the
salmon
fishery
is
engaged
covers
approximately
3000
or
3500
miles
from
southeast
alaska
near
ketchikan
up
through
near
the
artic
ocean.
the
coastline
is
segmented
into
11
districts
based
generally
upon
geography,
the
coastline,
the
types
of
bays
involved
and
perhaps
based
upon
the
species
of
fish
which
appear
in
those
areas.
and
when
one
acquires
a
license
to
fish
for
salmon
in
alaska,
he
is
licensed
only
for
one
of
those
11
areas
and
if
during
one
season
he
acquires
a
license
for
let's
say
the
southeast
alaskan
area,
he
may
not
then
fish
in
the
bristol
bay
area,
he
is
limited
to
a
particular
area
during
each
season
and
appellees
assert
that
the
statute
coupled
with
the
area
requirement
in
effect
closes
the
class
of
those
who
may
engage
in
the
commercial
salmon
fishery.
we
would
assert
that
in
order
to
reach
this
decision,
this
conclusion,
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
entire
aspect
of
the
areas
involved
bares
further
investigation.
they're
simply
not
enough
at
this
point
to
reach
the
appellees
conclusion.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
my
point
is
that
if
a
fisherman
is
licensed
in
southeast
alaska
as
a
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
one
of
the
11
areas,
that
the
very
fact
that
he
has
to
acquire
a
license
to
fish
in
bristol
bay
in
some
other
year
and
that
fact
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
right.
if
he
wishes
to
fish
in
bristol
bay
in
a
year
other
than
the
year
in
which
he
is
licensed
in
southeast
alaska,
he
must
comply
with
the
statute
and
fish
commercially
three
years
prior
to
acquiring
a
salmon
net
gear
license
in
a
new
area
or
he
must
have
been
licensed
in
that
area.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yeah,
my
point
is
that
the
deprivation
of
his
right
to
fish
based
upon
the
application
of
the
area
requirement
is
not
necessarily
clear
from
the
state
of
the
record
as
it
appeared
in
the
lower
court.
the
effect
upon
the
area
requirement,
say
upon
his
right
to
use
his
vessel
upon
the
right
to
use
his
gear
to
his
economic
detriment
is
not
necessarily
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court
record
and
that
if
he
in
fact
is
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
fishing
vessel
or
of
the
right
to
fish
in
any
particular
area
because
of
the
area
requirement,
that
conclusion
cannot
be
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
appears
in
this
court.
i
believe
that
the
questions
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
district
court
did
not
discuss
this
ground
too
heavily
mr.
justice.
the
appellees
have
argued
this
ground
quite
heavily
in
their
brief
and
i
would
assert
that
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
appellees
may
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
their
vessels
during
any
particular
salmon
fishing
season
because
of
the
area
requirement
is
not
supported
by
the
record
at
the
present
time.
the
main
point
i
am
attempting
to
make
is
that
the
fishery
regulation
in
alaska
is
extremely
complex
involving
areas
of
differing
types
of
salmon,
differing
weather
conditions,
differing
sea
conditions
and
that
at
the
stage
in
which
the
district
court
reached
its
conclusion,
none
of
this
particular
factors
had
been
investigated
by
the
court.
the
second
point
which
the
state
of
alaska
is
urging
is
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
completely
from
reaching
a
conclusion
in
this
case.
the
basis
for
our
argument
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
is
due
to
the
fact
that
appellees
asserted
that
the
statute
violated
unique
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution,
those
provisions
are
as
i
have
stated
that
no
exclusive
right
of
fishery
should
be
granted
and
that
the
fishery
source
is
reserved
to
the
people
for
their
common
use.
these
provisions
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
are
unique
among
the
state
constitutions
and
no
constitution
contains
language
similar
to
that
of
alaska
and
therefore,
the
interpretation
of
these
provisions
have
not
been
resolved
by
any
court
of
any
state
including
alaska.
generally,
there
are
three
grounds
upon
which
abstention
maybe
granted
and
three
grounds
which
support
the
requirement
that
a
district
court
abstain
from
deciding
federal
questions.
first,
abstention
should
be
granted
to
avoid
a
decision
involving
federal
constitutional
grounds
where
the
state
law
may
resolve
the
question.
this
of
course
is
applicable
to
this
case
and
that
the
application
of
the
exclusive
right
of
fishery
provision
of
the
alaska
constitution
could
resolve
this
case
without
the
necessity
of
deciding
a
federal
constitutional
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
also,
abstention
has
been
required
to
avoid
needless
conflict
with
the
state's
administration
of
its
own
resource
and
its
own
affairs.
this
is
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
state's
police
power
should
be
the
proper
means
to
regulate
a
resource.
the
appellees
would
assert
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
so
clear
on
its
face
that
it
needs
no
further
interpretation
and
certainly
needs
no
interpretation
in
the
light
of
the
state's
police
power.
i
would
assert
that
this
is
not
true
and
an
example
would
make
this
point
clear.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
i
believe
it's
quoted
at
the
very
beginning
under
constitutional
provisions
on
page
3.
i've
set
out
the
two
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution
which
are
involved.
every
constitution
contains
the
requirement
that
no
state
shall
impair
the
obligation
of
contract.
however,
this
court
has
ruled
that
a
state
may
in
fact
impair
the
obligation
of
contract
pursuant
to
a
valid
exercise
of
its
police
power.
i
would
assert
that
in
this
case,
the
state
of
alaska
may
create
if
necessary
in
the
valid
exercise
of
its
police
power
and
exclusive
right
of
fishery,
the
extent
to
which
it
may
do
this
should
be
determined
by
a
court
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
should
not
have
been
determined
by
the
federal
district
court
of
alaska.
these
provisions
as
i
have
said
have
not
been
interpreted
by
any
state
court.
appellees
assert
that
the
case
of
hynes
versus
grimes
packing
company
which
interpreted
similar
federal
statutory
provision
during
territorial
days
is
determinative
of
this
case.
however,
in
the
hynes
case,
the
secretary
of
interior
had
granted
an
exclusive
right
of
fishery
over
a
particular
area
to
a
particular
native
village.
there
is
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
justify
his
granting
of
this
right
pursuant
to
any
conservation
purpose
or
other
regulatory
police
power
purpose.
in
this
case
of
course,
the
state
of
alaska
has
recognized
that
the
accumulation
of
excessive
net
gear
has
resulted
in
an
over
harvest
of
the
fishery
and
has
created
severe
management
and
enforcement
problems.
this
is
quite
different
from
the
case
of
hynes
where
there
was
no
regulation
of
this
type
involved.
lastly,
the
appellees
have
asserted
that
the
industry
of
fishing
is
a
common
calling
and
as
such
is
apparently
immune,
from
state
regulation
of
this
sort.
the
mere
fact
that
industry
is
called
the
common
calling
does
not
remove
it
from
state
regulation
if
that
regulation
is
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
a
resource
to
rectify
management
and
enforcement
problems
with
that
resource.
this
has
been
done
in
the
past
at
common
law
at
such
economic
pursuits
as
the
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages
or
the
transportation
of
people
for
hire
were
considered
common
callings.
however,
at
the
present
stage,
these
activities
are
heavily
regulated
by
the
states
and
quite
often
certificates
of
public
convenience
a
necessity
are
required.
there
is
no
reason
why
salmon
fishing
especially
with
net
gear
should
be
removed
from
state
regulation
simply
because
it
is
connoted
as
being
a
common
calling.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
disagree
with
the
construction
of
the
alaska
court.
i'm
asking
that
the
court
should
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
be
held
pending
the
determination
of
the
unique
alaska
constitutional
provisions
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
law
by
an
alaska
court.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
one
other
answer
would
be
that
at
the
present
stage
of
the
record,
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
constitutional
provision
is
not
necessarily
--
does
not
necessarily
reach
the
result
that
that
provision
has
violated.
i
don't
believe
there
is
enough
in
the
present
stage
of
the
record
to
reach
that
conclusion.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
depending
on
--
depending
upon
the
position
that
this
court
takes
in
its
application
of
the
abstention
doctrine.
first,
the
doctrine
has
been
characteristically
applied
in
order
to
avoid
the
reaching
of
a
federal
constitutional
decision
if
the
matter
could
be
resolved
by
the
application
of
a
state
constitutional
provision.
also,
i
would
urge
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional
under
federal
constitutional
provision.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
and
that
there
was
nothing
before
the
court
sufficient
to
justify
its
conclusion
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
none.
this
statute
has
not
been
interpreted
by
an
alaska
court
so
far
as
i
know
it
at
any
level.
the
only
litigation
involving
the
statute
has
been
this
case
which
commenced
in
the
federal
district
court
in
anchorage
and
again,
this
points
up
my
claim
that
since
we
are
involved
with
a
highly
complex
industry,
unique
constitutional
provisions
that
it
is
appropriate
for
state
court
determination.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice
black,
the
alaska
court
could
decide
although
the
state
would
naturally
fight
the
issue
heavily
in
the
state
court
but
it
is
possible
that
it
could
reach
a
decision
that
the
statute
is
in
violation
of
the
exclusive
right
and
common
privilege
provisions
of
the
alaska
constitution.
if
that
were
so
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
if
that
were
so,
that
would
knock
the
entire
statute
out
since
the
provisions
do
not
apply
themselves
piece
meal
across
the
statute
if
it
is
unconstitutional
under
state
law,
the
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
determine
in
the
light
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
there'd
certainly
be
no
advantage
to
the
state
if
that
were
the
conclusion
of
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
however
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
this
is
one
of
the
attacks.
however,
mr.
justice,
the
state
at
this
point
is
asserting
that
if
it
were
afforded
a
complete
hearing
at
the
state
court
level
in
the
light
of
the
alaska
provisions
that
it
could
prove
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
state
court.
in
other
words,
we
feel
that
given
a
fair
hearing
in
plenary
proceedings
in
a
state
court,
we
could
show
that
the
statute
is
a
valid
application
of
the
state's
police
power
under
those
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
this
under
that
result
--
this
would
be
possible
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that
would
be
a
fact
that
if
the
state
court
resolved
that
the
statute
was
constitutional,
the
federal
question
would
remain
for
decision.
however,
there
have
been
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
my
theory
on
this
mr.
justice,
under
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
the
england
versus
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners,
that
the
federal
question
should
be
reserved
in
the
federal
court
for
its
determination
that
the
state
court
should
not
determine
if
there's
the
abstention
doctrine,
should
not
determine
the
alaska,
should
not
determine
the
federal
provisions.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
they
may.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
they
may
do
this
if
they,
they
are
not
required
to
do
so
mr.
justice
as
i
read
england
correctly.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
obtain
the
position
that
this
court
should
not
decide
the
equal
protection
issue
since
there's
not
enough
before
it
to
decide
that
issue.
i
believe
on
that
point
that,
the
record
should
be
supplemented
by
further
hearings
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
and
there
might
not
be
a
decision
against
us
if
we
are
afforded
a
full
hearing.
thank
you.
