justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
conclusion
in
that
respect?
it
wasn't
just
a
construction
of
statute
i
think,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
has
had
a
salmon
license
the
last
year,
in
any
year
in
the
particular
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
just
as
a
matter
of
the
way
the
statute
operated,
no
one
could
get
a
license
unless
existing
fisherman
approved
him,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
in
these
salmon
fishing
areas,
how
would
one
be
a
commercial
fisherman
except
by
fishing
for
salmon,
are
there
other
fish,
commercial
fish
on
those
same
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
can
make
a
living
catching?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
does
anybody
do
it
and
make
a
living
without
fishing
for
salmon
in
those
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
those
same
salmon
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
lets
assume
that
a
man
works
as
an
employee
for
a
salmon
fishery
for
three
years
then
applies
for
his
own
salmon
license,
has
he
satisfied
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
be
licensed
as
a
commercial
fisherman
to
work
as
an
employee
for
a
salmon
fisherman?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
as
an
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
law
require
you
to
actually
the
fish
three
years
as
a
commercial
fisherman
rather
than
just
to
hold
the
license
as
a
commercial
fisherman?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
court
rest
on
this
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
answer
to
the
district
court's
invalidation
of
the
statute
under
the
alaska
constitution,
is
your
only
answer
that
it
shouldn't
have
done
so,
it
should
have
differed
to
the
state
courts,
or
are
you
asking
us
to
disagree
with
court,
with
the
three-judge
court
on
the
construction
of
the
alaska
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
only
answer
is
to
differ
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
keep
saying
that
but
you
don't
have
to
have
their
consent
to
go
out
and
fish.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
--
fish
with
the
net
should
be
troll.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
can
troll,
you
just
won't
catch
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
keep
saying
you
can't
fish
except
with
the
consent
of
somebody
to
fish
all
you
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
only
true
in
bristol
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
are
a
lot
of
areas
which
is
isn't
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that's
enough
to
invalidate
the
entire
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
a
different
point.
you're
just
challenging
the
state
judgment
that
there
is
a
relationship
and
that's
certainly
a
different
point
from
saying
that
you
can't
fish
at
all.
and
of
course,
you
can
fish
and
how
about
catching
of
the
fish
besides
salmon?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
bristol
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
can't
say
it
categorically,
the
state
is
saying,
go
ahead
and
fish
commercially.
learn
about
the
area,
learn
about
the
water
and
the
--
other
characteristics
and
how
to
handle
a
boat.
maybe
you
won't
learn
a
lot
about
salmon
fishing
but
at
least
you
will
be
satisfied
that
you
can
maintain
yourself
on
the
ocean
safely
and
obey
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
enough
for
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
in
your
opinion,
but
it's
only
you
because
you
disagree
with
the
substantive
judgment
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
then
that
--
i
suppose
you
would
concede
the
state
has
the
right
to
limit
the
number
of
people
fishing
in
the
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
no
power
to
limit
the
number
of
fisherman
in
the
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
get
me
now
to
the
state
constitution,
if
the
state
wants
to
limit
lake
conservation,
a
step
to
preserve
its
fish,
the
only
way
it
can
do
this
is
by
limiting
the
hours
of
fishing
or
the
number
of
fish
that
can
be
caught
or
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
if
enough
the
people
came
in,
there
just
wouldn't
be
any
commercial
fishing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
never
make
a
living.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
strong
could
survive,
i
suppose.
justice
byron

what

the
