well,
that's
only
the
plaintiffs
on
the
federal
suit.
what
if
that
i
want
it
that
way,
isn't
it
under
england?
they
may
submit
it
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
required
to
do
if
they
want
to
stay
in
the
federal
court
as
expressly
do
alert
the
state
courts
that
they
want
to
go
back
to
the
federal
court,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
argument
here
though
mr.
cranston
in
the
light
of
what's
been
pointed
out
by
justices,
black
and
douglas
i.e.
that
the
equal
protection
question
is
here,
that
was
decided
by
the
federal
district
court
and
that
is
before
us
now
and
as
i
understood
your
argument,
it
is
simply
on
the
merits
of
that
issue
that
this
does
not
violate
the
protection
because
this
is
economic
regulation
and
the
court
long
sense
is
not
an
the
area
of
economic
regulation
has
discarded
the
practices
of
the
court
of
the
20's
and
the
30's
to
strike
down
economic
legislation
of
the
states
under
the
due
process
or
equal
protection
clause,
and
that
on
the
merits
therefore,
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
if
it's
reversed
in
that
aspect
of
the
case,
then
and
only
then,
only
if
you
win
on
equal
protection
then,
with
respect
to
the
other
horn
of
the
case,
i.e.
the
validity
of
this
legislation
under
the
alaska
constitution,
that's
the
matter
in
which
there
should
be
abstention,
isn't
that
your
argument,
or
on
the
other
hand
are
you
telling
us
that
we
should
not
here
decide
the
equal
protection
issue?
