mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
post-conviction
hearing
in
this
case
disclosed
the
following
facts
which
should
be
emphasized.
petitioner
was
24
years
old
when
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
charge
of
kidnapping
a
young
woman.
an
element
of
the
charge
in
the
government's
case
was
that
petitioner
and
his
codefendant
raped
their
victim
several
times
during
the
abduction.
petitioner
was
represented
by
competent
and
experienced
counsel.
after
thoroughly
investigating
the
case,
counsel
concluded,
“that
we
just
couldn't
go
to
a
jury,
it
would
be
almost
sure
conviction.”
petitioner's
codefendant
tafoya
had
given
a
confession
which
fully
implicated
the
petitioner.
thereafter,
tafoya
decided
to
plea
guilty
and
seek
leniency
from
the
court
when
the
ground
the
petitioner
was
the
instigator
and
principal
actor
in
the
crime.
faced
with
the
testimony
of
his
victim
and
other
witnesses
including
possibly
his
codefendant,
petitioner
with
the
concurrence
of
his
counsel
entered
the
plea
of
guilty.
petitioner
now
contends
that
his
conviction
must
be
set
aside
in
the
authority
of
united
states
versus
jackson.
he
does
not
argue
that
his
guilty
plea
involuntary
in
a
traditional
sense
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
few
minutes,
rather
his
arguments
rest
entirely
when
the
court's
finding
in
jackson
that
the
death
penalty
provision
needlessly
encouraged
guilty
pleas
in
jury
waivers.
we
must
assume
that
such
encouragement
was
present
in
this
case,
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
needless
encouragement
so
far
undermines
the
validity
of
the
guilty
plea
that
petitioner
is
thereby
entitled
to
release
on
habeas
corpus.
the
function
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
as
the
court
said
in
fay
versus
noia
is
to
provide
a
prompt
and
efficacious
remedy
for
whatever
society
deems
to
be
intolerable
restraints.
he
is
continued
incarceration
under
a
needlessly
encouraged
guilty
plea
and
intolerable
restraints.
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
in
our
brief,
we
consider
two
theories
under
which
the
validity
of
the
guilty
plea
might
be
affected
by
the
needless
encouragement
rational
of
jackson.
the
first
theory
which
i
will
discuss
in
more
detail
here
is
the
jackson
announced
a
new
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
the
voluntariness
of
the
guilty
plea.
this
is
the
approach
taken
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
alfred
case
which
was
argued
yesterday.
the
second
theory
is
unrelated
to
the
concept
of
voluntariness,
the
elements
of
this
theory
are,
one,
that
jackson
established
in
essence
a
right
to
be
free
from
needless
encouragement.
and
two,
that
this
right
should
be
applied
retroactively
so
that
all
defendants
who
had
previously
pleaded
guilty
are
entitled
to
automatic
release
on
habeas
corpus.
returning
to
the
involuntariness
theory,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
determination
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
guilty
plea
to
a
kidnapping
indictment
is
not
affected
by
the
decision
in
jackson.
even
before
jackson
was
decided,
a
defendant's
extreme
fear
to
death
sentence
after
trial
could
have
been
shown
to
establish
the
involuntariness
of
his
guilty
plea.
the
fact
that
the
statute
created
a
needless
encouragement
added
nothing
to
its
coercive
effect.
it
has
long
been
held
that
in
the
involuntary
guilty
plea
is
invalid
in
subject
to
collateral
attack
continued
incarceration
under
such
a
plea
is
in
the
language
of
noia
an
intolerable
restraint.
we
borrow
from
the
more
developed
body
of
law
concerning
confessions
for
statement
of
the
test
of
voluntariness,
that
is
whether
the
fear
or
inducement
to
which
the
defendant
must
subjected
was
sufficient
to
overcome
his
capacity
to
make
a
free
and
rational
decision.
but
more
important
than
a
statement
of
a
test
is
an
understanding
of
the
policy
considerations
which
underlie
the
rule.
the
first
of
these
considerations
is
he
overriding
purpose
of
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
ensure
the
reliability
of
criminal
convictions.
we
reject
guilty
pleas
that
the
product
of
compulsive
pressures
because
of
our
concern
that
such
pressures
may
have
caused
the
conviction
of
one
who
is
not
in
fact
guilty
of
a
crime
to
which
he
pleaded.
the
second
consideration
which
underlies
the
requirement
of
voluntariness
is
our
concern
for
preserving
the
dignity
and
integrity
of
the
individual
in
the
criminal
process.
this
is
the
fundamental
principle
enforced
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
adversary
system
of
justice
to
subject
the
individual
to
compelling
pressures
which
overcome
hid
determination
to
make
the
state
prove
its
case
against
him.
with
these
considerations
in
mind,
we
think
that
the
fear
of
the
death
penalty
which
overcomes
the
defendant's
capacity
to
make
a
free
and
rational
decision
renders
his
guilty
plea
involuntary.
such
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
in
a
matter
which
precludes
the
death
penalty
is
entitled
to
relief
even
if
the
death
penalty
provisions
are
entirely
constitutional.
but
there
is
no
showing
in
this
case
of
a
fear
to
death
penalty
which
deprived
the
petitioner
of
his
capacity
to
make
a
free
and
rational
choice.
he
was
represented
by
competent
counsel
who
fully
investigated
the
prosecution's
case
and
the
possible
avenues
of
defense.
counsel
concluded
that
there
was
no
realistic
hope
of
acquittal
if
the
case
went
to
trial.
petitioner
had
been
counting
upon
the
assistance
of
his
codefendant
tafoya
and
the
expectation
that
they
would
both
give
consistent
exculpatory
testimony.
but
when
tafoya
who
would
giving
the
confession
implicating
the
petitioner,
decided
to
plead
guilty,
petitioner
concluded
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
the
same
and
seek
leniency
from
the
court.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
petitioner
was
so
moved
by
fear
of
the
death
penalty
that
he
could
not
realistically
assess
his
chances
for
conviction
or
acquittal.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
defendant
abandoned
a
substantial
defense
because
of
his
fear
of
execution.
this
is
a
case
where
the
defendant
knew
he
would
be
convicted
and
freely
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
to
risk
the
sentence
of
death.
but
the
question
remains
whether
petitioner's
guilty
plea
should
be
viewed
as
involuntary
because
the
death
penalty
was
a
needless
or
unnecessary
burden
on
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
we
believe
as
mr.
justice
white
recognized
in
a
different
context
in
the
harrison
case
that
the
compulsive
effect
of
the
capital
punishment
provision
is
not
related
to
the
necessity
or
the
validity
of
the
provision.
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
provision
was
subsequently
declared
invalid
gives
no
additional
reason
to
conclude
that
petitioner's
will
was
overborne.
it
gives
no
reason
to
believe
the
petitioner
was
not
in
fact
guilty
of
the
charge.
the
needlessness
of
the
encouragement
we
submit
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
whether
that
encouragement
produced
an
involuntary
guilty
plea.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
mr.
justice.
i
will
leave
to
our
brief
the
discussion
of
the
alternative
theory
on
which
petitioner
might
be
entitled
to
relief
on
the
basis
of
jackson.
under
that
theory,
jackson
would
be
viewed
as
creating
a
new
constitutional
right
to
an
unencumbered
choice,
the
choice
of
plea
or
motive
trial
free
from
needless
encouragement.
if
this
right
is
given
retroactive
application,
then
petitioner
and
all
other
defendants
who
pleaded
guilty
under
the
kidnapping
act
or
entitled
to
their
immediate
release.
although,
we
doubt
the
jackson
decision
was
intended
to
create
such
a
right,
we
analyze
this
theory
in
our
brief
and
we
conclude
that
retroactive
application
of
such
a
right
is
not
appropriate
because
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
do
not
cast
out
on
the
accuracy
or
integrity
of
prior
convictions.
petitioner's
argument
that
the
principle
of
jackson
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
involuntary
pleas
in
the
future
and
hence,
a
possibility
that
there
were
involuntary
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act
prior
to
the
invalidation
of
the
death
penalty
provision.
it's
fully
answered
as
it
was
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
by
the
fact
that
such
defendants
have
available
to
them,
a
vehicle
to
show,
the
involuntariness
of
their
guilty
plea.
finally,
it
may
be
argued
that
our
inquiry
has
been
too
limited
and
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
jackson
decision
had
no
effect
or
whatsoever
on
previous
guilty
pleas.
in
preparation
of
our
brief
and
our
argument,
we
have
tried
to
explore
other
possible
theories
in
which
jackson
would
affect
past
convictions.
indeed,
three
different
theories
are
presented
by
the
three
individuals
in
these
cases
argued
yesterday
and
today.
but
the
difficulty
in
selecting
any
of
these
theories
is
that
the
jackson
opinion,
if
it
is
to
be
applied
to
previous
convictions
at
all
gives
no
indication
as
to
which
defendants
should
and
should
not
benefit
from
it.
when
the
proper
retrospective
effect
of
the
rule
is
thus
so
uncertain,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
course
is
to
decline
to
release
serious
offenders
without
it
showing
of
the
involuntariness
of
the
guilty
plea
under
established
standards.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
post-conviction
hearing
in
this
case
disclosed
the
following
facts
which
should
be
emphasized.
petitioner
was
24
years
old
when
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
charge
of
kidnapping
a
young
woman.
an
element
of
the

we
submit
that
it
is
not.
in
our
brief,
we
consider
two
theories
under
which
the
validity
of
the
guilty
plea
might
be
affected
by
the
needless
encouragement
rational
of
jackson.

that
the

of

that
theory,
jackson
would
be
viewed
as
creating
a
new
constitutional
right
to
an
unencumbered
choice,
the
choice
of
plea
or
motive
trial
free
from
needless
encouragement.
if
this
right
is
given
retroactive
application,
then
petitioner
and
all
other
defendants
who
pleaded
guilty
under
the
kidnapping
act
or
entitled
to
their
immediate
release.
although,
we
doubt
the
jackson
decision
was
intended
to
create
such
a
right,
we
analyze
this
theory
in
our
brief
and
we
conclude
that
retroactive
application
of
such
a
right
is
not
appropriate
because
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
do
not
cast
out
on
the
accuracy
or
integrity
of
prior
convictions.
petitioner's
argument
that
the
principle
of
jackson
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
involuntary
pleas
in
the
future
and
hence,
a
possibility
that
there
were
involuntary
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act
prior
to
the
invalidation
of
the
death
penalty
provision.
it's
fully
answered
as
it
was
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
by
the
fact
that
such
defendants
have
available
to
them,
a
vehicle
to
show,
the
involuntariness
of
their
guilty
plea.
finally,
it
may
be
argued
that
our
inquiry
has
been
too
limited
and
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
jackson
decision
had
no
effect
or
whatsoever
on
previous
guilty
pleas.
in
preparation
of
our
brief
and
our
argument,
we
have
tried
to
explore
other
possible
theories
in
which
jackson
would
affect
past
convictions.
indeed,
three
different
theories
are
presented
by
the
three
individuals
in
these
cases
argued
yesterday
and
today.
but
the
difficulty
in
selecting
any
of
these
theories
is
that
the
jackson
opinion,
if
it
is
to
be
applied
to
previous
convictions
at
all
gives
no
indication
as
to
which
defendants
should
and
should
not
benefit
from
it.
when
the
proper
retrospective
effect
of
the
rule
is
thus
so
uncertain,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
course
is
to
decline
to
release
serious
offenders
without
it
showing
of
the
involuntariness
of
the
guilty
plea
under
established
standards.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
