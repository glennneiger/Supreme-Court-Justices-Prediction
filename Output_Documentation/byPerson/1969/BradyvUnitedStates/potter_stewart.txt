mr.
adang,
does
the
--
is
the
decision
in
your
favor
on
retroactivity
have
impact
far
beyond
the
kidnapping
act?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
may
be
in
six,
seven
or
eight
states.
so
when
you
start
counting
that
numbers,
you
can
just
talk
about
significance.
justice
potter
stewart
possibility?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
stronger
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
since
we
don't
know,
you
can't
just
say
its
120.
no,
i
didn't
say
it
was
120
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that,
i'm
sorry.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
government's
arguments
on
the
substantial
adverse
effects,
simply
isn't
supported
by
the
facts
which
they
cite
in
their
brief.
and
therefore
we
have
a
nebulous
question.
as
i
was
stating,
the
government
has
made
a
second
argument
on
the
purpose
of
jackson
and
they
state
that
jackson
should
only
be
applied
to
those
cases
in
which
an
individual
has
plead
not
guilty
and
been
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
situation
where
there
is
a
bargain
for
penalty
without
the
bargain
for
a
lesser
degree
or
another
crime
or
through
the
defense,
is
the
straight
charge
and
the
plea
of
guilty
in
return
for
recommendation
not
only
in
certain
sentence,
then
you
are
right
in
fact
in
jackson,
absolutely
as
you
read
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
the
court
accepts
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
accepts
it
and
what
if
it
were
acceptable?
what
if
they
plead
--
pled
guilty
and
the
bargain
wasn't
kept?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
were
accepted,
if
the
court
followed
the
recommendation,
the
court
asked
the
prosecutor
what
he
recommends,
perhaps
that
isn't
the
practice
but
assume
it
did
and
the
prosecutor
made
the
recommendation
and
it
was
taken
and
accepted
and
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
you
didn't
have
jackson
on
the
books
at
all,
would
you
be
here
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
jackson
decision
had
never
been
made?
justice
potter
stewart
given
jackson
mr.
adang,
what
if
your
client
had
not
pleaded
guilty
but
had
waived
the
jury
trial
and
requested
to
be
pleaded
not
guilty
and
request
a
trial
before
the
judge
and
had
been
sentence
to
50
years
in
the
penitentiary
as
your
client
was,
would
you
be
here
trying
to
set
that
aside
under
reasoning
of
jackson?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
you're
saying
in
your
argument
is
leaving
out
the
question
for
retroactivity
that
the
jackson
decision
has
now
impact
upon
what
the
issue
is
in
determining
whether
the
plea
of
guilty
is
coerced
or
not
coerced?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
adang,
does
the
--
is
the
decision
in
your
favor
on
retroactivity
have
impact
far
beyond
the
kidnapping
act?
