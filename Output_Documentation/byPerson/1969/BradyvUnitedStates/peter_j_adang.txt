mr.
peter
j.
adang
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
robert
m.
brady
in
the
case
of
brady
against
the
united
states
which
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
this
case
involves
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
vacate
sentence
made
under
title
28
section
2255
of
the
united
states
code.
i
believe
that
this
case
presents
three
issues
for
resolution
by
this
court.
these
are,
first,
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
jackson
will
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act.
secondly,
if
the
decision
is
to
be
given
such
retroactive
application,
the
question
is
what
test
will
be
formulated
to
determine
when
such
guilty
pleas
were
involuntary
prior
to
that
decision?
and
finally,
assuming
that
the
court
does
make
jackson
retroactive
as
suggested
and
does
formulate
an
appropriate
test,
how
the
facts
of
the
petitioner's
case
fit
within
that
test?
i
would
like
to
depart
somewhat
from
orthodox
procedure
on
oral
argument
and
address
myself
initially
to
the
first
issue
which
i
have
mentioned
and
that
is
the
retroactivity
of
the
jackson
decision.
and
the
reason
i'd
like
to
do
this
if
the
court
would
allow
me
is
because
i
feel
that
this
is
a
question
which
can
and
should
be
determined
as
an
abstract
proposition
of
law
without
reference
to
the
facts
of
this
case
or
any
particular
case
for
that
matter.
also,
i
would
like
to
say
that
at
this
time
that
since
we
only
received
the
government's
answer
brief
last
monday,
we're
unable
to
have
an
opportunity
to
file
a
reply
brief
and
therefore
i'd
like
to
try
to
concentrate
on
attempting
to
rebut
the
arguments
which
appear
in
the
government's
answer
brief.
the
government
has
taken
a
position
on
retroactivity
which
we
feel
is
essentially
a
negative
argument
which
as
a
practical
matter
would
allow
very
little
or
possibly
even
no
retroactive
application
of
the
jackson
decision.
the
government
quite
directly
points
out
in
its
answer
brief
that
there
are
apparently
two
underlying
purposes
for
jackson.
first,
to
prevent
discouragement
of
guilty
pleas
and
deterrence
or
encouragement
of
guilty
pleas
and
discouragement
of
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
secondly,
to
stop
penalizing
those
defendants
who
do
assert
their
constitutional
rights
to
a
jury
trial
and
to
plea
not
guilty.
essentially
then,
the
government's
argument
is
that
we
should
only
apply
jackson
retroactively
to
those
cases
in
which
a
defendant
has
pled
not
guilty
and
then
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death.
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
the
first
purpose
which
we
believe
is
inherent
in
jackson
should
also
be
given
retroactive
application
and
we
have
brief
3
arguments
in
support
of
this
contention
as
alternative
arguments
for
retroactive
application
of
the
decision
to
prior
guilty
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act.
the
first
of
these
arguments
we
believe
is
that
it
is
implicit
from
the
language
of
the
case
itself
that
it
should
be
given
such
application
retroactively.
this
court
held
in
jackson
that
the
evil
in
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
of
the
kidnapping
act
was
that
it
tended
to
discourage
assertion
of
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty
and
deter
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
this
evil
while
it
wasn't
necessarily
coercive
was
held
to
be
needlessly
encouraging
of
guilty
pleas
and
this,
the
court
said,
had
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights.
that
chilling
effect
being
unnecessary
was
therefore
excessive.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
rationale
behind
jackson
or
the
implicit
rationale
was
that
if
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
had
been
allowed
to
remain
in
the
kidnapping
act,
there
would
have
been
a
potentiality
in
the
future
for
involuntary
guilty
pleas
and
we
submit
that
if
that
is
recognized,
then
there
has
to
be
a
recognition
of
the
implicit
corollary
and
that
is
that
guilty
pleas
prior
to
jackson
might
also
have
been
involuntary.
and
if
that
presumption
is
accepted,
then
i
feel
that
jackson
had
to
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas
automatically
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
involuntary
guilty
pleas
are
subject
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
feel
that
it
is
your
honor.
assuming
that
we're
talking
about
a
statute
with
the
same
kind
of
a
selective
death
penalty
provision
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
believe
that
it
should
be
applicable
postulating
that
we
have
the
same
kind
of
a
statute
and
the
same
kind
of
selective
death
penalty
provision,
i
would
submit
that
it
should
be
applicable
to
the
states.
the
government
has
made
an
argument
in
rebuttal
to
our
contention
on
retroactivity
that
when
this
court
stated
in
the
jackson
decision
that
not
every
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
under
the
kidnapping
act
to
a
capital
indictment
does
so
involuntarily.
this
court
implicitly
rejected
any
contention
that
prior
guilty
plea
should
be
open
to
collateral
attack.
we
feel
that
the
conclusion
hardly
follows
from
the
language
of
the
case.
we
feel
that
all
the
case
says
is
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
say
that
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
was
necessarily
coercive
because
that
would
have
meant
invalidating
all
prior
guilty
pleas
automatically.
we
submit
that
the
court
merely
was
recognizing
that
some
guilty
pleas
could
be
involuntary
in
the
future
and
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
then
left
in
the
act,
and
as
i
stated
before,
i
think
the
implicit
corollary
is
that
some
guilty
pleas
in
the
past
could
also
have
been
the
involuntary.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
jackson
should
be,
under
the
language
of
the
case
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
now,
in
alternative
argument
which
we
have
made
is
that
under
the
doctrine
of
absolute
retroactive
invalidity
of
an
unconstitutional
statute,
there
should
also
be
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
and
because
of
the
time
limitation
on
this
argument
and
the
fact
that
the
government
hasn't
made
any
response
to
this
contention,
i'm
going
to
skip
over
unless
the
court
has
some
question.
another
argument
which
we
made
is
again
an
alternative
argument
and
the
court
had
heard
it
yesterday
and
that
is
that
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
retroactivity
question,
jackson
should
also
be
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
these
decisions
are
discussed
in
detail
in
our
brief
in
chief
at
pages
28
through
32
and
i'm
sure
they're
more
familiar
to
the
court
than
they
are
to
me
so
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
them
in
any
detail
except
to
mention
that
the
court
did
say
in
the
case
of
linkletter
against
walker
that
there
are
three
tests
for
determining
retroactivity
of
prior
decisions
and
these
tests
are
first,
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule.
secondly,
the
extent
of
reliance
upon
the
old
rule
by
law
enforcement
authorities.
and
finally,
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
of
a
retroactive
application
of
the
new
decision.
in
the
desist
against
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
most
important
of
these
considerations
is
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule
and
it
has
been
further
held
that
when
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
is
to
ensure
fair
trials
and
reliable
verdicts,
in
other
words,
to
ensure
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process,
then
that
consideration
is
paramount
and
other
consideration
such
as
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officials
or
in
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
deserve
a
little
consideration.
and
we
submit
that
under
that
philosophy,
that
the
jackson
decision
must
also
be
given
the
retroactive
effect
which
we
suggest.
the
effect
of
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
is
the
federal
kidnapping
act
in
inducing
individuals
to
plead
guilty
in
order
to
avoid
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
was
not
merely
to
deny
them
a
fair
trial
but
it
was
to
deny
them
any
trial
at
all.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
it
is
obvious
that
the
implicit
purpose
of
jackson
was
to
ensure
fair
trials
if
individuals
wanted
trials
and
to
ensure
reliable
verdicts
if
they
are
going
to
plead
guilty.
and
i
feel
therefore
that
because
of
this
and
because
of
the
authorities
cited,
jackson
should
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
now,
the
government
had
made
to
arguments
in
response
to
this.
first,
the
government
has
said,
“if
we
give
jackson
such
retroactive
effect,
we're
probably
going
to
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice.”
but
in
the
very
next
breadth,
the
government
says,
“well,
there
are
only
about
a
120
federal
prisoners
now
in
custody
under
guilty
pleas
or
bench
trials
under
the
kidnapping
act.”
and
then
it
further
admits
that
not
all
of
these
individuals
are
incarcerated
under
capital
indictments
and
as
i
will
show
the
court
later,
we're
only
concerned
here
with
capital
indictment
situations.
so
the
number
of
individuals
that
we're
dealing
with
is
something
less
that
a
120
under
the
kidnapping
act.
even
if
we
add
to
this
number,
those
individuals
who
are
incarcerated
under
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
or
similar
state
statute
having
selective
death
penalty
provisions,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
number
we're
talking
about
really
isn't
that
great.
and
even
if
every
one
of
these
cases
were
to
be
reviewed
on
a
collateral
attack,
we
don't
feel
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
effect,
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
especially
when
compared
to
the
potential
adverse
effect
that
there
would
have
been
had
this
court
made
in
miranda
or
griffin
or
mapp
retroactive.
i
had
one
of
those
decisions
had
been
made
retroactive,
the
effect
would
have
been
on
literally
thousands
of
prior
convictions
as
opposed
to
mere
handful
of
cases
we're
talking
about
here.
so
we
don't
feel
for
this
reason
that
the
argument
of
the
government
on
a
substantial
adverse
effect
is
really
supported
by
the
facts
which
the
government
cites.
in
addition
to
this,
the
government
has
made
another
argument
and
this
is
that
purpose
of
jackson
doesn't
require
that
we
give
a
retroactive
effect
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
the
government
says
and
i
pointed
this
out
previously
that
jackson
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
believe
it
would
your
honor.
we'll
the
kidnapping
act
and
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
and
state
statutes
where
we
do
have
selective
death
penalty
provisions
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
that
is
a
possibility
but
i
don't
think
that
the
government
has
submitted
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
as
i
stated
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
we're
talking
about.
certainly
i
don't
think
it
would
be
the
kind
of
effect
that
we
would
have
had
in
miranda
been
made
retroactive.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
no,
it
wasn't
your
honor,
because
jackson
--
the
facts
in
the
holding
of
jackson
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
believe
that
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
while
the
facts
of
jackson
were
very
limited,
i
think
that
because
of
the
holding,
it
encompasses
our
argument
and
the
retroactivity.
i
think
that
the
government's
argument
as
i
was
pointing
out
is
essentially
a
negative
argument
because
unless
the
government
has
found
some
magical
formula
for
resurrecting
the
dead,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
very
much
retroactive
application
under
their
theory.
i
don't
again
have
all
of
the
figures
on
death
penalty
convictions
but
as
i
understand
that
there
are
only
been
six
of
them
under
the
federal
kidnapping
act
and
i
understand
also
that
all
of
these
people
have
already
been
executed,
even
again
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
possibility
that
there
are
some
people
now
under
death
penalty
sentences
under
the
bank
robbery
act
which
i
don't
believe
there
are
because
the
only
case
that's
come
up
in
the
past
year
has
been
pope
against
the
united
states.
and
the
individuals
who
may
be
sentenced
under
state
statutes
on
death
penalty
were
probably
not
talking
about
a
very
great
number
of
individuals
and
i
think
it's
really
infinitesimal
and
i
feel
therefore
that
essentially
the
government's
argument
for
retroactivity
is
that
there
wouldn't
been
any
retroactivity
or
very
little
in
any
event.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may,
i'll
address
myself
to
this
argument
because
the
government
has
raised
it
in
its
answer
brief.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
even
if
we
have
needless
encouragement
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
we're
dealing
with
of
a
guilty
plea,
that
doesn't
equate
with
involuntariness
or
coercion
and
therefore,
evidence
of
needless
encouragement
is
irrelevant,
so
the
government
cites
in
factual
support
of
this
the
situations
involving
multi-count
indictments
or
several
indictments
against
the
same
individual
or
the
lesser
degree
of
the
same
crime.
and
the
government
says
that
in
this
situation,
an
individual
might
very
well
be
encouraged
to
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
degree
of
crime
in
order
to
have
some
counts
dropped
against
him
or
some
indictments
dismissed
or
to
get
a
lesser
degree
to
avoid
a
harsher
penalty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
to
some
extent,
but
in
that
situation,
it's
obvious
that
the
recommendation
is
not
binding
on
the
court
so
there's
really
no
guarantee.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
again
i
don't
think
that
would
invalidate
the
plea
because
the
courts
have
always
held
in
this
kind
of
situation
the
recommendation
of
the
united
state's
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
in
the
case
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
so,
i
don't
think
that
in
that
situation,
the
claim
of
the
plea
was
involuntary
would
be
necessary
upheld.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well
again,
i
think
all
i
can
say
about
is
you
get
down
to
a
negotiating
situation
or
bargaining
situation
and
we've
always
held
that
plea
bargaining
is
not
itself
invalid
whereas
in
the
situation
of
the
death
penalty
provision,
that's
there
in
the
statute
and
it
itself
creates
a
compulsion.
another
analogy
might
be
the
situation
where
a
judge
on
arraignment
says
to
the
defendant,
“if
you
plead
guilty,
i'm
going
to
give
you
20
years
of
imprisonment.
if
you
plead
not
guilty
and
are
convicted,
i'm
going
to
give
you
50
years
of
imprisonment.
and
i
think
in
that
situation,
it's
fairly
obvious
that
the
guilty
plea
of
one
results
is
invalidated.
it
is
involuntary.
and
i
think
that
our
situation
here
is
instead
of
the
judge
saying
that,
the
statute
says
it,
is
you
plead
not
guilty,
the
maximum
penalty
is
the
death
penalty
whereas
if
you
plead
guilty,
the
most
you
can
get
is
life
imprisonment.
so,
i
feel
that
that
is
a
more
consistent
analogy
with
the
situation
and
does
support
our
argument.
i
was
going
to
say
previously
that
in
addition,
the
government's
theory
if
one
thinks
about
it
would
be
to
punish
the
potential
innocent
individual
and
reward
the
guilty
individual.
in
other
words,
the
government
would
say,
“let's
reward
those
people
that
were
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
the
death
penalty
by
reducing
their
sentences.”
but
let's
not
go
into
prior
guilty
pleas
on
collateral
attack
and
thereby
i
think
we
would
potentially
punish
individuals
who
might
be
innocent
or
who
might
be
incarcerated
because
of
the
clear
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
so,
i
think,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
jackson
should
be
given
the
retroactive
application
which
we
request.
with
that,
and
assuming
that
the
court
does
adopt
that
argument,
i'd
like
to
give
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case
to
present
the
framework
for
the
remaining
arguments
which
we
have
in
our
brief.
now
brady
here
was
indicted
under
the
federal
kidnapping
act
on
january
27,
1959
and
it
was
a
capital
indictment.
he
was
arraigned
on
the
following
day
and
he
pled
not
guilty.
on
april
30,
1959,
he
was
again
brought
before
the
judge
and
he
changed
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty.
and
on
may
8,
1959,
he
was
sentenced
to
50
years
imprisonment
which
was
later
reduced
by
executive
clemency.
on
september
20,
1967
he
filed
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
and
as
i
stated
in
his
motion,
he
contended
that
his
plea
was
coerced
and
nor
entered
freely
and
voluntarily
and
the
argument
he
made
was
essentially
the
argument
which
appeared
in
the
jackson
case.
there
were
other
claims
in
the
motion
but
they
are
not
issue
in
this
proceeding.
on
march
20,
1968
his
came
on
for
hearing
and
evidence
was
introduced
on
all
of
the
claims
and
the
evidence
and
the
influence
of
the
death
penalty
provision
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
go
into
it,
it's
quite
detailed
but
i
believe
that
the
government
has
admitted
in
it's
answer
brief
that
brady
was
undoubtedly
encouraged
and
motivated
to
plead
guilty
by
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
his
desire
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
death
penalty.
after
all
of
the
evidence
was
in
the
district
court
denied,
the
motion
on
all
of
the
grounds
stated
and
it
held
that
the
federal
kidnapping
act
was
constitutional
and
i
feel
that
it
implicitly
held
that
because
the
statute
was
constitutional,
brady's
claim
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
coerced
him
was
without
any
merit.
on
april
8th
of
last
year,
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
of
the
jackson
case
and
the
denial
of
brady's
motion
was
then
appealed.
and
the
tenth
circuit
on
december
17,
1968
affirmed
the
decision.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
apparently
held
the
decision
in
the
jackson
case
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas
but
it
went
on
to
state
that
the
existence
of
the
prescribed
provision
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
all
individuals
prior
to
jackson
who
had
pled
guilty
did
so
involuntarily.
and
therefore,
to
affirm
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
brady's
guilty
plea
was
influenced
and
encouraged
by
factors
other
than
the
death
penalty
provision.
it
held
that
that
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
the
second
point
in
our
brief
in
chief
we
have
proposed
a
test
to
be
utilized
by
district
courts
in
determining
when
prior
guilty
pleas
are
involuntary.
as
i
stated
before,
we're
only
concerned
here
with
cases
where
the
death
penalty
was
a
reasonable
possibility
and
that
would
only
those
cases
where
there
was
a
capital
indictment.
once
that
requisite
is
satisfied,
the
next
question
is
what
kind
of
evidence
will
be
necessary
to
show
that
a
guilty
plea
is
involuntary.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
practical
and
reasonable
test
that
can
be
formulated
is
a
simple
test
and
rather
undefined
and
that
is,
that
if
the
district
court
can
find
from
the
evidence,
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
desire
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
death
penalty
was
a
definite
factor
or
substantial
factor
in
motivating
the
guilty
plea,
then
that
should
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
guilty
plea.
now
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
think
there
you
can
probably
postulate
situations
your
honor
where
it
wouldn't
be.
for
example,
i
think
maybe
in
the
situation
where
an
individual
was
indicted
under
the
kidnapping
act
and
also
was
indicted
under
the
state
charge
for
first-degree
murder,
he
might
conceivably
very
well
plead
guilty
to
the
kidnapping
charge
to
have
the
state
charge
against
him
dropped
and
he
might
not
even
consider
the
possibility
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
kidnapping
act.
but
really,
that
kind
of
argumentation
doesn't
lead
anything
to
the
question.
it
kind
of
obfuscates
the
issue.
i
think
there
are
certainly
can
be
cases
wherein
an
individual
would
plead
guilty
not
out
of
fear
of
the
death
penalty
but
out
of
a
genuine
sense
of
guilt.
the
practical
question
is
in
every
one
of
these
cases
an
individual
is
going
to
claim
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty
and
he
get
involved
in
an
evidentiary
problem.
and
the
question
is,
how
do
you
resolve
that?
and
i
think
that
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
give
the
district
courts
this
general
test
and
let
them
go
from
there
because
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
district
courts
aren't
going
to
believe
the
testimony
in
every
case
of
the
defendant
himself
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty,
i
think
they
are
going
to
require
that
there
would
be
some
more
independent
objective
evidence
of
the
influence
of
the
death
penalty.
and
i
think
that
this
kind
of
evidence
could
come
from
the
lawyers
that
were
involved,
or
from
possibly
other
witnesses
who
were
involved
at
the
time
who
would
have
less
of
a
motivation
to
fabricate
a
story
than
to
accused
himself.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
that's
postulating
leaving
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
and
i
would
say
no,
it
would
not
because
i
think
that
question
has
already
been
dealt
within
jackson
because
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
make
a
complete
demonstration
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea
that
he
is
guilty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
the
purpose
and
thrust
is
to
determine
whether
he
is
making
his
plea
voluntarily
and
not
whether
he
is
guilty
or
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
in
other
words
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
alright
then
adopting
the
court's
line
of
reasoning,
assuming
there
is
some
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
that
still
does
not
necessarily
rule
out
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
would
motivate
and
encourage
that
guilty
plea.
in
other
words,
a
factual
basis
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
man
is
in
fact
guilty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
with
the
death
penalty
provision
in
there,
i
would
say
that
is
correct.
if
we
take
the
death
penalty
provision
out,
then
we
alleviate
the
problem.
and
that's
crux
of
the
matter.
the
death
penalty
provision
is
the
fly
in
the
ointment
and
i
think
if
we
take
that
out,
then
we
alleviate
the
problem.
i
see
that
my
time
is
rapidly
coming
to
a
close
and
i
would
just
like
to
summarized
our
last
point
briefly
and
that
is
that
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
brady's
guilty
plea
was
encouraged
and
motivated
by
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
that
it
was
a
substantial
factor
in
his
plea.
his
lawyers
testified
to
this.
other
witnesses
testified
to
this
and
there
was
evidence
on
the
statements
made
by
the
court
to
him
at
the
time
his
plea
and
time
of
all
of
these
proceedings.
and
the
government
has
admitted
that
there
was
encouragement
of
his
guilty
plea
and
i
feel
therefore
that
because
of
his
evidence,
brady's
guilty
plea
should
be
vacated
and
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
should
be
granted.
the
government's
argument
is
that,
even
if
we
show
encouragement
of
a
guilty
plea
under
our
test,
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
invalidate
the
guilty
plea
because
it
wouldn't
be
involuntary
and
the
government
cites
cases
which
extensively
hold
that
an
individual
can
only
show
that
his
plea
is
involuntary
if
he
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
fear
overcame
his
capacity
to
make
a
rationale
decision.
now
i
believe
that
these
cases
are
not
in
point,
they
all
involve
the
plea
bargaining
situation
which
i
have
discussed
previously
with
the
court.
and
it's
always
been
held
in
the
plea
bargaining
situation
that
guilty
pleas
bargained
for
are
not
involuntary.
and
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
if
jackson
decision
had
never
been
made
i
think
eventually
if
not
this
case,
some
other
case
would
have
obviously,
this
case
was
based
upon
jackson
because
it
was
cited
in
the
motion.
but
if
jackson
hadn't
been
decided
i
think
eventually
a
case
would
have
gotten
here
anyway
because
i
really
believe
that
this
is
an
invalid
procedure
and
i
think
that
it
does
induce
involuntary
guilty
pleas.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
think
i
would
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
third
exercise
of
this
right
to
a
jury
trial.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
that's
not
a
consideration
because
here,
there's
evidence
in
the
appendix
that
the
district
court
prior
to
the
plea
had
indicated
that
he
would
not
allow
bench
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
robert
m.
brady
in
the
case
of
brady
against
the
united
states
which
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
this
case
involves
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
vacate
sentence
made
under
title
28
section
2255
of
the
united
states
code.
i
believe
that
this
case
presents
three
issues
for
resolution
by
this
court.
these
are,
first,
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
jackson
will
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act.
secondly,
if
the
decision
is
to
be
given
such
retroactive
application,
the
question
is
what
test
will
be
formulated
to
determine
when
such
guilty
pleas
were
involuntary
prior
to
that
decision?
and
finally,
assuming
that
the
court
does
make
jackson
retroactive
as
suggested
and
does
formulate
an
appropriate
test,
how
the
facts
of
the
petitioner's
case
fit
within
that
test?
i
would
like
to
depart
somewhat
from
orthodox
procedure
on
oral
argument
and
address
myself
initially
to
the
first
issue
which
i
have
mentioned
and
that
is
the
retroactivity
of
the
jackson
decision.
and
the
reason
i'd
like
to
do
this
if
the
court
would
allow
me
is
because
i
feel
that
this
is
a
question
which
can
and
should
be
determined
as
an
abstract
proposition
of
law
without
reference
to
the
facts
of
this
case
or
any
particular
case
for
that
matter.
also,
i
would
like
to
say
that
at
this
time
that
since
we
only
received
the
government's
answer
brief
last
monday,
we're
unable
to
have
an
opportunity
to
file
a
reply
brief
and
therefore
i'd
like
to
try
to
concentrate
on
attempting
to
rebut
the
arguments
which
appear
in
the
government's
answer
brief.
the
government
has
taken
a
position
on
retroactivity
which
we
feel
is
essentially
a
negative
argument
which
as
a
practical
matter
would
allow
very
little
or
possibly
even
no
retroactive
application
of
the
jackson
decision.
the
government
quite
directly
points
out
in
its
answer
brief
that
there
are
apparently
two
underlying
purposes
for
jackson.
first,
to
prevent
discouragement
of
guilty
pleas
and
deterrence
or
encouragement
of
guilty
pleas
and
discouragement
of
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
secondly,
to
stop
penalizing
those
defendants
who
do
assert
their
constitutional
rights
to
a
jury
trial
and
to
plea
not
guilty.
essentially
then,
the
government's
argument
is
that
we
should
only
apply
jackson
retroactively
to
those
cases
in
which
a
defendant
has
pled
not
guilty
and
then
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death.
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
the
first
purpose
which
we
believe
is
inherent
in
jackson
should
also
be
given
retroactive
application
and
we
have
brief
3
arguments
in
support
of
this
contention
as
alternative
arguments
for
retroactive
application
of
the
decision
to
prior
guilty
pleas
under
the
kidnapping
act.
the
first
of
these
arguments
we
believe
is
that
it
is
implicit
from
the
language
of
the
case
itself
that
it
should
be
given
such
application
retroactively.
this
court
held
in
jackson
that
the
evil
in
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
of
the
kidnapping
act
was
that
it
tended
to
discourage
assertion
of
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty
and
deter
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
this
evil
while
it
wasn't
necessarily
coercive
was
held
to
be
needlessly
encouraging
of
guilty
pleas
and
this,
the
court
said,
had
a
chilling
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights.
that
chilling
effect
being
unnecessary
was
therefore
excessive.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
rationale
behind
jackson
or
the
implicit
rationale
was
that
if
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
had
been
allowed
to
remain
in
the
kidnapping
act,
there
would
have
been
a
potentiality
in
the
future
for
involuntary
guilty
pleas
and
we
submit
that
if
that
is
recognized,
then
there
has
to
be
a
recognition
of
the
implicit
corollary
and
that
is
that
guilty
pleas
prior
to
jackson
might
also
have
been
involuntary.
and
if
that
presumption
is
accepted,
then
i
feel
that
jackson
had
to
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas
automatically
because
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
involuntary
guilty
pleas
are
subject
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
feel
that
it
is
your
honor.
assuming
that
we're
talking
about
a
statute
with
the
same
kind
of
a
selective
death
penalty
provision
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
believe
that
it
should
be
applicable
postulating
that
we
have
the
same
kind
of
a
statute
and
the
same
kind
of
selective
death
penalty
provision,
i
would
submit
that
it
should
be
applicable
to
the
states.
the
government
has
made
an
argument
in
rebuttal
to
our
contention
on
retroactivity
that
when
this
court
stated
in
the
jackson
decision
that
not
every
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
under
the
kidnapping
act
to
a
capital
indictment
does
so
involuntarily.
this
court
implicitly
rejected
any
contention
that
prior
guilty
plea
should
be
open
to
collateral
attack.
we
feel
that
the
conclusion
hardly
follows
from
the
language
of
the
case.
we
feel
that
all
the
case
says
is
that
the
court
was
not
going
to
say
that
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
was
necessarily
coercive
because
that
would
have
meant
invalidating
all
prior
guilty
pleas
automatically.
we
submit
that
the
court
merely
was
recognizing
that
some
guilty
pleas
could
be
involuntary
in
the
future
and
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
then
left
in
the
act,
and
as
i
stated
before,
i
think
the
implicit
corollary
is
that
some
guilty
pleas
in
the
past
could
also
have
been
the
involuntary.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
jackson
should
be,
under
the
language
of
the
case
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
now,
in
alternative
argument
which
we
have
made
is
that
under
the
doctrine
of
absolute
retroactive
invalidity
of
an
unconstitutional
statute,
there
should
also
be
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
and
because
of
the
time
limitation
on
this
argument
and
the
fact
that
the
government
hasn't
made
any
response
to
this
contention,
i'm
going
to
skip
over
unless
the
court
has
some
question.
another
argument
which
we
made
is
again
an
alternative
argument
and
the
court
had
heard
it
yesterday
and
that
is
that
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
retroactivity
question,
jackson
should
also
be
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
these
decisions
are
discussed
in
detail
in
our
brief
in
chief
at
pages
28
through
32
and
i'm
sure
they're
more
familiar
to
the
court
than
they
are
to
me
so
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
them
in
any
detail
except
to
mention
that
the
court
did
say
in
the
case
of
linkletter
against
walker
that
there
are
three
tests
for
determining
retroactivity
of
prior
decisions
and
these
tests
are
first,
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule.
secondly,
the
extent
of
reliance
upon
the
old
rule
by
law
enforcement
authorities.
and
finally,
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
of
a
retroactive
application
of
the
new
decision.
in
the
desist
against
united
states,
this
court
held
that
the
most
important
of
these
considerations
is
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule
and
it
has
been
further
held
that
when
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule
is
to
ensure
fair
trials
and
reliable
verdicts,
in
other
words,
to
ensure
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process,
then
that
consideration
is
paramount
and
other
consideration
such
as
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officials
or
in
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
deserve
a
little
consideration.
and
we
submit
that
under
that
philosophy,
that
the
jackson
decision
must
also
be
given
the
retroactive
effect
which
we
suggest.
the
effect
of
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
is
the
federal
kidnapping
act
in
inducing
individuals
to
plead
guilty
in
order
to
avoid
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
was
not
merely
to
deny
them
a
fair
trial
but
it
was
to
deny
them
any
trial
at
all.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
it
is
obvious
that
the
implicit
purpose
of
jackson
was
to
ensure
fair
trials
if
individuals
wanted
trials
and
to
ensure
reliable
verdicts
if
they
are
going
to
plead
guilty.
and
i
feel
therefore
that
because
of
this
and
because
of
the
authorities
cited,
jackson
should
be
given
retroactive
application
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
now,
the
government
had
made
to
arguments
in
response
to
this.
first,
the
government
has
said,
“if
we
give
jackson
such
retroactive
effect,
we're
probably
going
to
have
a
substantial
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice.”
but
in
the
very
next
breadth,
the
government
says,
“well,
there
are
only
about
a
120
federal
prisoners
now
in
custody
under
guilty
pleas
or
bench
trials
under
the
kidnapping
act.”
and
then
it
further
admits
that
not
all
of
these
individuals
are
incarcerated
under
capital
indictments
and
as
i
will
show
the
court
later,
we're
only
concerned
here
with
capital
indictment
situations.
so
the
number
of
individuals
that
we're
dealing
with
is
something
less
that
a
120
under
the
kidnapping
act.
even
if
we
add
to
this
number,
those
individuals
who
are
incarcerated
under
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
or
similar
state
statute
having
selective
death
penalty
provisions,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
number
we're
talking
about
really
isn't
that
great.
and
even
if
every
one
of
these
cases
were
to
be
reviewed
on
a
collateral
attack,
we
don't
feel
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
effect,
adverse
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice,
especially
when
compared
to
the
potential
adverse
effect
that
there
would
have
been
had
this
court
made
in
miranda
or
griffin
or
mapp
retroactive.
i
had
one
of
those
decisions
had
been
made
retroactive,
the
effect
would
have
been
on
literally
thousands
of
prior
convictions
as
opposed
to
mere
handful
of
cases
we're
talking
about
here.
so
we
don't
feel
for
this
reason
that
the
argument
of
the
government
on
a
substantial
adverse
effect
is
really
supported
by
the
facts
which
the
government
cites.
in
addition
to
this,
the
government
has
made
another
argument
and
this
is
that
purpose
of
jackson
doesn't
require
that
we
give
a
retroactive
effect
to
prior
guilty
pleas.
the
government
says
and
i
pointed
this
out
previously
that
jackson
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
believe
it
would
your
honor.
we'll
the
kidnapping
act
and
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
and
state
statutes
where
we
do
have
selective
death
penalty
provisions
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
that
is
a
possibility
but
i
don't
think
that
the
government
has
submitted
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
as
i
stated
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
we're
talking
about.
certainly
i
don't
think
it
would
be
the
kind
of
effect
that
we
would
have
had
in
miranda
been
made
retroactive.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
no,
it
wasn't
your
honor,
because
jackson
--
the
facts
in
the
holding
of
jackson
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
believe
that
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
while
the
facts
of
jackson
were
very
limited,
i
think
that
because
of
the
holding,
it
encompasses
our
argument
and
the
retroactivity.
i
think
that
the
government's
argument
as
i
was
pointing
out
is
essentially
a
negative
argument
because
unless
the
government
has
found
some
magical
formula
for
resurrecting
the
dead,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
very
much
retroactive
application
under
their
theory.
i
don't
again
have
all
of
the
figures
on
death
penalty
convictions
but
as
i
understand
that
there
are
only
been
six
of
them
under
the
federal
kidnapping
act
and
i
understand
also
that
all
of
these
people
have
already
been
executed,
even
again
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
possibility
that
there
are
some
people
now
under
death
penalty
sentences
under
the
bank
robbery
act
which
i
don't
believe
there
are
because
the
only
case
that's
come
up
in
the
past
year
has
been
pope
against
the
united
states.
and
the
individuals
who
may
be
sentenced
under
state
statutes
on
death
penalty
were
probably
not
talking
about
a
very
great
number
of
individuals
and
i
think
it's
really
infinitesimal
and
i
feel
therefore
that
essentially
the
government's
argument
for
retroactivity
is
that
there
wouldn't
been
any
retroactivity
or
very
little
in
any
event.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may,
i'll
address
myself
to
this
argument
because
the
government
has
raised
it
in
its
answer
brief.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
even
if
we
have
needless
encouragement
in
this
case
or
in
any
case
we're
dealing
with
of
a
guilty
plea,
that
doesn't
equate
with
involuntariness
or
coercion
and
therefore,
evidence
of
needless
encouragement
is
irrelevant,
so
the
government
cites
in
factual
support
of
this
the
situations
involving
multi-count
indictments
or
several
indictments
against
the
same
individual
or
the
lesser
degree
of
the
same
crime.
and
the
government
says
that
in
this
situation,
an
individual
might
very
well
be
encouraged
to
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
degree
of
crime
in
order
to
have
some
counts
dropped
against
him
or
some
indictments
dismissed
or
to
get
a
lesser
degree
to
avoid
a
harsher
penalty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
to
some
extent,
but
in
that
situation,
it's
obvious
that
the
recommendation
is
not
binding
on
the
court
so
there's
really
no
guarantee.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
again
i
don't
think
that
would
invalidate
the
plea
because
the
courts
have
always
held
in
this
kind
of
situation
the
recommendation
of
the
united
state's
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
in
the
case
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
so,
i
don't
think
that
in
that
situation,
the
claim
of
the
plea
was
involuntary
would
be
necessary
upheld.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well
again,
i
think
all
i
can
say
about
is
you
get
down
to
a
negotiating
situation
or
bargaining
situation
and
we've
always
held
that
plea
bargaining
is
not
itself
invalid
whereas
in
the
situation
of
the
death
penalty
provision,
that's
there
in
the
statute
and
it
itself
creates
a
compulsion.
another
analogy
might
be
the
situation
where
a
judge
on
arraignment
says
to
the
defendant,
“if
you
plead
guilty,
i'm
going
to
give
you
20
years
of
imprisonment.
if
you
plead
not
guilty
and
are
convicted,
i'm
going
to
give
you
50
years
of
imprisonment.
and
i
think
in
that
situation,
it's
fairly
obvious
that
the
guilty
plea
of
one
results
is
invalidated.
it
is
involuntary.
and
i
think
that
our
situation
here
is
instead
of
the
judge
saying
that,
the
statute
says
it,
is
you
plead
not
guilty,
the
maximum
penalty
is
the
death
penalty
whereas
if
you
plead
guilty,
the
most
you
can
get
is
life
imprisonment.
so,
i
feel
that
that
is
a
more
consistent
analogy
with
the
situation
and
does
support
our
argument.
i
was
going
to
say
previously
that
in
addition,
the
government's
theory
if
one
thinks
about
it
would
be
to
punish
the
potential
innocent
individual
and
reward
the
guilty
individual.
in
other
words,
the
government
would
say,
“let's
reward
those
people
that
were
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
the
death
penalty
by
reducing
their
sentences.”
but
let's
not
go
into
prior
guilty
pleas
on
collateral
attack
and
thereby
i
think
we
would
potentially
punish
individuals
who
might
be
innocent
or
who
might
be
incarcerated
because
of
the
clear
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
so,
i
think,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
jackson
should
be
given
the
retroactive
application
which
we
request.
with
that,
and
assuming
that
the
court
does
adopt
that
argument,
i'd
like
to
give
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case
to
present
the
framework
for
the
remaining
arguments
which
we
have
in
our
brief.
now
brady
here
was
indicted
under
the
federal
kidnapping
act
on
january
27,
1959
and
it
was
a
capital
indictment.
he
was
arraigned
on
the
following
day
and
he
pled
not
guilty.
on
april
30,
1959,
he
was
again
brought
before
the
judge
and
he
changed
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty.
and
on
may
8,
1959,
he
was
sentenced
to
50
years
imprisonment
which
was
later
reduced
by
executive
clemency.
on
september
20,
1967
he
filed
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
and
as
i
stated
in
his
motion,
he
contended
that
his
plea
was
coerced
and
nor
entered
freely
and
voluntarily
and
the
argument
he
made
was
essentially
the
argument
which
appeared
in
the
jackson
case.
there
were
other
claims
in
the
motion
but
they
are
not
issue
in
this
proceeding.
on
march
20,
1968
his
came
on
for
hearing
and
evidence
was
introduced
on
all
of
the
claims
and
the
evidence
and
the
influence
of
the
death
penalty
provision
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
go
into
it,
it's
quite
detailed
but
i
believe
that
the
government
has
admitted
in
it's
answer
brief
that
brady
was
undoubtedly
encouraged
and
motivated
to
plead
guilty
by
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
his
desire
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
death
penalty.
after
all
of
the
evidence
was
in
the
district
court
denied,
the
motion
on
all
of
the
grounds
stated
and
it
held
that
the
federal
kidnapping
act
was
constitutional
and
i
feel
that
it
implicitly
held
that
because
the
statute
was
constitutional,
brady's
claim
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
coerced
him
was
without
any
merit.
on
april
8th
of
last
year,
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
of
the
jackson
case
and
the
denial
of
brady's
motion
was
then
appealed.
and
the
tenth
circuit
on
december
17,
1968
affirmed
the
decision.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
apparently
held
the
decision
in
the
jackson
case
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
prior
guilty
pleas
but
it
went
on
to
state
that
the
existence
of
the
prescribed
provision
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
all
individuals
prior
to
jackson
who
had
pled
guilty
did
so
involuntarily.
and
therefore,
to
affirm
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
brady's
guilty
plea
was
influenced
and
encouraged
by
factors
other
than
the
death
penalty
provision.
it
held
that
that
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
and
the
second
point
in
our
brief
in
chief
we
have
proposed
a
test
to
be
utilized
by
district
courts
in
determining
when
prior
guilty
pleas
are
involuntary.
as
i
stated
before,
we're
only
concerned
here
with
cases
where
the
death
penalty
was
a
reasonable
possibility
and
that
would
only
those
cases
where
there
was
a
capital
indictment.
once
that
requisite
is
satisfied,
the
next
question
is
what
kind
of
evidence
will
be
necessary
to
show
that
a
guilty
plea
is
involuntary.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
practical
and
reasonable
test
that
can
be
formulated
is
a
simple
test
and
rather
undefined
and
that
is,
that
if
the
district
court
can
find
from
the
evidence,
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
the
desire
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
death
penalty
was
a
definite
factor
or
substantial
factor
in
motivating
the
guilty
plea,
then
that
should
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
guilty
plea.
now
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
think
there
you
can
probably
postulate
situations
your
honor
where
it
wouldn't
be.
for
example,
i
think
maybe
in
the
situation
where
an
individual
was
indicted
under
the
kidnapping
act
and
also
was
indicted
under
the
state
charge
for
first-degree
murder,
he
might
conceivably
very
well
plead
guilty
to
the
kidnapping
charge
to
have
the
state
charge
against
him
dropped
and
he
might
not
even
consider
the
possibility
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
kidnapping
act.
but
really,
that
kind
of
argumentation
doesn't
lead
anything
to
the
question.
it
kind
of
obfuscates
the
issue.
i
think
there
are
certainly
can
be
cases
wherein
an
individual
would
plead
guilty
not
out
of
fear
of
the
death
penalty
but
out
of
a
genuine
sense
of
guilt.
the
practical
question
is
in
every
one
of
these
cases
an
individual
is
going
to
claim
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty
and
he
get
involved
in
an
evidentiary
problem.
and
the
question
is,
how
do
you
resolve
that?
and
i
think
that
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
give
the
district
courts
this
general
test
and
let
them
go
from
there
because
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
district
courts
aren't
going
to
believe
the
testimony
in
every
case
of
the
defendant
himself
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
death
penalty,
i
think
they
are
going
to
require
that
there
would
be
some
more
independent
objective
evidence
of
the
influence
of
the
death
penalty.
and
i
think
that
this
kind
of
evidence
could
come
from
the
lawyers
that
were
involved,
or
from
possibly
other
witnesses
who
were
involved
at
the
time
who
would
have
less
of
a
motivation
to
fabricate
a
story
than
to
accused
himself.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
that's
postulating
leaving
the
selective
death
penalty
provision
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
and
i
would
say
no,
it
would
not
because
i
think
that
question
has
already
been
dealt
within
jackson
because
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
make
a
complete
demonstration
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea
that
he
is
guilty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
the
purpose
and
thrust
is
to
determine
whether
he
is
making
his
plea
voluntarily
and
not
whether
he
is
guilty
or
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
in
other
words
--
mr.
peter
j.
adang
alright
then
adopting
the
court's
line
of
reasoning,
assuming
there
is
some
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
that
still
does
not
necessarily
rule
out
that
fear
of
the
death
penalty
would
motivate
and
encourage
that
guilty
plea.
in
other
words,
a
factual
basis
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
man
is
in
fact
guilty.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
with
the
death
penalty
provision
in
there,
i
would
say
that
is
correct.
if
we
take
the
death
penalty
provision
out,
then
we
alleviate
the
problem.
and
that's
crux
of
the
matter.
the
death
penalty
provision
is
the
fly
in
the
ointment
and
i
think
if
we
take
that
out,
then
we
alleviate
the
problem.
i
see
that
my
time
is
rapidly
coming
to
a
close
and
i
would
just
like
to
summarized
our
last
point
briefly
and
that
is
that
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
brady's
guilty
plea
was
encouraged
and
motivated
by
fear
of
the
death
penalty
and
that
it
was
a
substantial
factor
in
his
plea.
his
lawyers
testified
to
this.
other
witnesses
testified
to
this
and
there
was
evidence
on
the
statements
made
by
the
court
to
him
at
the
time
his
plea
and
time
of
all
of
these
proceedings.
and
the
government
has
admitted
that
there
was
encouragement
of
his
guilty
plea
and
i
feel
therefore
that
because
of
his
evidence,
brady's
guilty
plea
should
be
vacated
and
his
motion
to
vacate
sentence
should
be
granted.
the
government's
argument
is
that,
even
if
we
show
encouragement
of
a
guilty
plea
under
our
test,
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
invalidate
the
guilty
plea
because
it
wouldn't
be
involuntary
and
the
government
cites
cases
which
extensively
hold
that
an
individual
can
only
show
that
his
plea
is
involuntary
if
he
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
fear
overcame
his
capacity
to
make
a
rationale
decision.
now
i
believe
that
these
cases
are
not
in
point,
they
all
involve
the
plea
bargaining
situation
which
i
have
discussed
previously
with
the
court.
and
it's
always
been
held
in
the
plea
bargaining
situation
that
guilty
pleas
bargained
for
are
not
involuntary.
and
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
well,
if
jackson
decision
had
never
been
made
i
think
eventually
if
not
this
case,
some
other
case
would
have
obviously,
this
case
was
based
upon
jackson
because
it
was
cited
in
the
motion.
but
if
jackson
hadn't
been
decided
i
think
eventually
a
case
would
have
gotten
here
anyway
because
i
really
believe
that
this
is
an
invalid
procedure
and
i
think
that
it
does
induce
involuntary
guilty
pleas.
mr.
peter
j.
adang
i
think
i
would
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
third
exercise
of
this
right
to
a
jury
trial.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
that's
not
a
consideration
because
here,
there's
evidence
in
the
appendix
that
the
district
court
prior
to
the
plea
had
indicated
that
he
would
not
allow
bench
trial.
thank
you.
