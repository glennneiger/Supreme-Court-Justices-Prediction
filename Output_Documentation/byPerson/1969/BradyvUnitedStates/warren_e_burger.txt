chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
brady
against
the
united
states.
mr.
adang,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
rational
you
are
urging
on
us
have
any
possible
application
to
situation
where
a
defendant
enters
a
guilty
plea
to,
let
us
say,
any
lesser
offense,
manslaughter
on
a
second-degree
murder
charge
where
no
death
penalty
is
involved,
where
he
is
giving
up
his
jury
trial
in
order
to
avoid
a
heavier
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
whole
idea
underlying
the
concept
of
plea
negotiations
and
discussions?
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
definite
distinction.
i
think
that
in
the
plea
bargaining
situation,
it
is
implicit
that
the
penalties
which
the
state
can't
create
for
the
various
degrees
of
crime
are
all
valid
in
constitutional
penalties,
in
other
words,
the
state
can
create
a
crime
of
first-degree
murder
and
make
that
penalty
and
sentence
and
create
a
crime
of
second-degree
murder
and
make
20
years
the
maximum
sentence.
and
in
that
situation,
the
individual
is
definitely
encouraged
to
plea
guilty
to
the
lesser
degree
to
avoid
the
harsher
penalty
but
as
i
stated,
the
distinction
is
that
there,
the
government
or
the
state
can
create
the
alternatives
and
therefore
the
choice
that
derives
from
those
alternatives
is
not
unnecessarily
compelling.
in
other
words,
i
would
submit
that
there
the
encouragement
is
only
incidental
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
choice
available
and
that
encouragement
is
not
unnecessary
and
is
not
excessive
whereas
in
the
death
penalty
situation,
it's
inherent
in
the
opinion
of
jackson
that
the
fact
there
is
a
choice
available,
is
itself
compulsion,
is
itself
unconstitutional.
there
the
court,
well
it's
implicit
in
the
essence
of
that
decision,
that
the
state
cannot
create
two
different
penalties
for
exactly
the
same
degree
of
crime
and
impose
the
harsher
penalty
only
when
the
individual
chooses
to
assert
his
constitutional
rights.
so
therefore
in
that
situation,
because
there
is
a
choice,
which
is
compelled
and
that
choice
is
unnecessary
and
avoidable,
the
encouragement
which
resolves
from
that
choice
is
also
unnecessary
and
excessive.
and
i
believe
it's
sufficient
to
make
a
guilty
plea
involuntary.
so
what
we
end
up
with
this
situation
in
the
plea
bargaining
case,
we
have
a
choice
available
but
that
choice
is
one
which
can
be
imposed
by
the
state.
the
encouragement
which
derived
from
that
choice
is
therefore
not
unnecessary
and
not
excessive
and
not
illegal.
however,
in
the
jackson
situation
or
the
kidnapping
act
situation,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
choice
is
itself
unconstitutional
and
therefore
the
encouragement
which
derives
from
that
choice
is
unnecessary
and
excessive
and
can
be
avoided
in
the
words
of
the
government.
so
i
don't
think
that
if
we're
going
to
make
jackson
retroactive
as
we
suggest
that
that
is
necessarily
going
to
affect
the
plea
bargaining
situations
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
there
always
be
a
definite
factor,
how
could
if
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there
is
complete
implementation
of
rule
11
on
the
judge
who
takes
the
plea
makes
an
inquiry
which
develops
all
the
facts
which
accumulatively
would
make
for
guilt?
would
you
then
say
that
that
satisfies
the
test
that
you
have
advanced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
a
complete
demonstration
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea
that
the
man
is
guilty,
do
you
say
that
would
not
be
enough
under
jackson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
--
isn't
that
the
purpose
and
thrust
of
rule
11,
the
new
federal
rules
or
the
amended
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
whether
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea?
that's
the
language
of
the
rule
isn't
it?
well,
yes
that's
true,
i
stand
corrected
on
that
that
is
the
basis
of
it
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
factual
basis
and
whether
there
are
--
but
the
factual
basis
is
a
practical
matter
is
determined
by
the
defendant
standing
there
and
saying,
“yes,
i
did
it”
which
is
his
guilty
plea.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
district
judge,
if
the
trial
judge
is
doing
his
task
the
way
it
should
be
done,
he
will
not
accept
that,
he
will
ask
the
man
to
recite
what
he
did
and
develop
on
the
record
the
full
statement
of
all
the
facts
that
would
--
a
summary
of
the
facts
that
would
be
in
the
case
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
argument
almost
carries
us
to
the
point
that
you
can't
have
a
guilty
plea
in
these
circumstances?
