mr.

i
overlooked
advising
you
and
your
co-counsel
and
friends
that
mr.

is
unavoidably
detained
but
he
will
participate
in

on
the
basis
of
course
the
entire
record,
the
briefs
and
the
tape
recording
of
the
oral

excuse
me
for
not
having
clarified
that
right
at
the
onset.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
get
that
latter
part
of
your
response
clear
in
mind
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
either
contemplate
or
can
it
reasonably
be
construed
so
that
the
plan
submitted
in
that
latter
week
could
have
been
put
into
effect
either
before
or
during
the
period
when
objections
were
being
filed
to
it
and
executed
pending
any
appeals
or
further
reviews
in
this
court.
chief

warren
e.

if
the
report
submitted
to
the
district
court
was
accepted
by
the
district
court
and
ordered
into
execution.
at
that
time,
that
is
to
say
in
time
for
september
1st
or
thereabout.
would
you
think
it
would
have
been
within
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
let
that
plan
be
carried
out
pending
any
appeal
and
further
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greenberg,
just
one
question
if
i
may,
since
we
are
very
swiftly
approaching
november
1st
now.
the
difference
between
your
position
and
that
of
the
solicitor
general
really
comes
down
into
something
like
60
days
more
or
less,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
read
his
brief
that
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
read
just
as
contemplating
and
certainly
permitting
during
just
what
you
had
suggested
earlier
namely
implementing
as
his
brief
says
and
then
litigating
against
the
background
of
that
implementation.
i
had
thought
that
you
and
the
department
of
justice
whereon
collision
course
here
coming
very
close
together.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
mr.
greenberg
on
the
problems
of
meridian
and
holmes
county
where
there's
some
building
problems
there,
structural?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
get
our
focus
again,
your
entire
argument
is
directed
to
the
timing
probable
now
as
i
get
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
timing
and
the
status
pending
in
the
appeals.
chief

warren
e.

those
two
i
regard
them
as
one
in
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

mr.
oberdorfer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suppose
mr.

that
that
last
sentence
of
the
court
of

opinion
that
you
just
read
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
37-a--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
was
directed
that
the
proposition
that
there
is
apparently
no
formal
semester
at
the
mid-year
or
approximately
mid-year
as
in
many
other
places
and
that
they
were
--
the
court
of
appeals
were
suggesting
that
if
this
can't
be
done
until
december,
let
it
be
done
in
december.
do
you
think
that's
what
they
were
driving
at?
do
you
read
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
oberdorfer.
mr.
leonard.
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
by
that,
do
you
mean
as
to
those
400,
that
there
are,
there's
no
pending
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
question
if
i
may.
if
there
had
been
no
appeal
here
after
the

had
acted,
can
you
assure
us

december
1st
