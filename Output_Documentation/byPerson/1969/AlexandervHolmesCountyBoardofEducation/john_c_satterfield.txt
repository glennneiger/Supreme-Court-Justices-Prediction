mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
--
and
then
the
court.
it
is
a
pleasure
to
appear
before
you
today
in
this
connection
because
there
are
quite
a
number
of
matters
which
i
believe
need
to
be
cleared
off
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
the
litigants
and
of
the
children
here
involved.
the
first
is
this
that
this
procedure
has
been
handled
by
the
petitioners
in
the
same
way
they
handled
the
appearance
before
the
fifth
circuit
(inaudible)
which
was
purely
on
a
motion
consenting
a
docket
setting
at
which
time,
the
fifth
circuit
had
no
record
before
it,
no
evidence
before
it,
no
briefing
over
the
basic
merits,
briefing
only
as
to
timing
and
at
which
time,
the
fifth
circuit
pronounced
(inaudible)
which
has
later
been
referred
to
as
law
of
the
case.
secondly,
when
these
cases
appeared
as
heinz
county
before
the
fifth
circuit,
they
were
heard
upon
eight
days
notice.
the
record
was
in
four
packing
boxes
and
was
not
available
to
the
court
and
the
court
in
its
direction
of
october
25th
found.
it
did
not
intend
to
review
the
record
but
would
accept
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
all
matters
of
fact
which
with
deference
in
whole
affair
to
do.
this
proceeding
is
brought
without
the
record
before
the
court.
although
it
was
available
to
be
brought
even
within
the
time
limited
under
rules
20
and
12
of
this
court
and
rule
11
of
the
rule
of
the
federal
procedures.
and
this
is
again
an
attempt
to
make
broad
statements
not
supported
by
the
record
because
there
is
no
record.
for
instance,
the
statement
had
been
made
to
some
3,000
pages
of
testimony
and
most
of
which
was
directed
toward
the
allegation
there's
a
difference
in
the
intelligence
of
negro
and
white
children.
that
statement
is
absolutely
without
any
foundation
is
in
fact,
in
fact
and
contrary
to
the
truth.
the
record
contains
evidence
demonstrating
compliance
by
many
of
these
districts
with
the
requirements
not
only
of
the
cases
throughout
the
years
but
the
green,
ray,
monroe
and
carr.
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
go
into
the
illustration.
we
had
the
time
to
bring
before
this
court
but
in
the
meridian
district,
in
athletics,
in
activities,
in
faculty,
in
participation
of
students,
it
is
demonstrated
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
longer
a
dual
system
but
there
is
a
unitary
system.
and
mrs.
comp
(ph)
a
leader
of
the
naacp
of
the
southern
christian
leadership
commerce
of
the
black
methodist
who
has
been
active
in
all
civil
rights
movements
in
meridian
for
the
last
31
years
testified
the
system
was
unitary,
that
there
was
a
complete
right
of
attendance
of
all
students
to
every
school
and
that
in
whole
opinion,
it
was
working
and
would
continue
to
work.
and
there
is
evidence
throughout
this
record
if
petitioners
were
willing
for
the
court
to
have
the
opportunity
of
saying
it,
of
that
nature,
applicable
to
most
of
these
issues.
they
differ
in
many,
very
different
ways.
may
i
call
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
it
has
been
stated
to
this
court,
we
did
not
know
until
when
you
read
the
brief
we
received
saturday
morning
after
office
close
as
the
statement
on
page
approximate
23
thereof,
they
would
be
made
available
to
the
court
copies
of
certain
plans.
we've
never
seen
what
was
handed
to
the
court
but
we've
seen
plans
that
were
filed.
i
assume
that
may
be
it.
but
it
should
be
noted
that
in
this
matter
the
petitioners
bring
piece
by
piece
that
would
say
what
the
court
to
see
but
have
asked
the
court
to
pass
upon
this
matter
without
there
being
before
the
court
the
record
of
the
court
which
was
available
to
them
and
could
be
brought.
and
what
do
they
ask?
their
prayer
appears
on
pages
30
and
31
of
their
present
brief
and
that
is
one
that
was
the
most
amazing,
it
frankly
may
it
please
the
court,
it
made
both
of
our
state
(inaudible)
stand
up.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
before.
in
the
first
place,
it
asked
this
court
to
require
that
they'd
be
put
into
effect
plans
which
have
been
withdrawn.
withdrawn
by
whom
under
own
allegations,
withdrawn
by
the
department
of
education,
health,
and
welfare
and
the
secretary
of
finance
extra
full
consideration
thereof.
they
have
been,
as
demonstrated
by
(inaudible),
he
found
that
they
were
not
sufficient.
that
was
reported
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
jordan
and
of
mr.
--
of
the
other
gentleman
who
testified.
this
gentleman,
mr.
solons,
one
of
the
top
employees
of
h.e.w
testified
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
assigned
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
witness
was
of
the
opinion
and
the
court
defines
that
in
order
to
formulate,
not
implement,
to
formulate
and
implement
successful
and
you
think
that
desegregation
plans,
their
additional
time
will
be
required.
now,
a
record
was
made
to
the
chaos
which
might
result
as
if
it
had
to
do
with
community
resistance.
that
is
another
matter
in
which
there's
an
attempt
to
give
an
erroneous
idea
to
this
court
to
put
it
in
a
most
charitable
way.
the
statement
of
the
secretary
is
as
follows
to
which
appeared
on
page
31
(e)
of
the
petitioner,
in
the
letter
written
by
the
secretary.
and
by
the
way,
that
came
into
the
court
as
an
exhibit
to
the
motion.
there's
no
attempt
to
have
an
indefinite
postpone
of
anything.
the
secretary's
obligation
solely
was
to
file
and
formulate
plans
before
the
action
would
be
taken
by
the
court
with
the
assistance
of
the
department
of
justice
(inaudible)
and
when
that
letter
came
to
chief
justice
john
brown
and
chief
district
judge
cox.
it
came
as
a
part
of
a
motion
setting
forth
timing
similar,
almost
identical
to
that
in
the
original
order
of
july
3rd
and
july
25th
with
the
exception
of
the
necessary
time
to
do
what?
not
to
implement
plans
but
to
form
proper
things.
now,
here's
what
mr.
finch
say.
he
says,
“i'm
gravely
concerned
that
the
time
allowed
for
the
development
of
these
terminal
plans
has
been
too
short
for
the
educators
of
the
office
of
education
to
develop
terminal
plans
which
can
be
implemented
this
year.”
the
administrative
and
what
is
here
before
right
you,
is
he
talking
about
community
as
has
been
stated
in
the
brief
erroneously
and
without
any
basis
whatsoever
without
the
record
being
before
the
court.
he
says,
the
administrative
and
logistical
difficulties,
the
administrative
which
must
be
encountered
and
made
in
the
terribly
short
space
of
time
must
surely
in
my
judgment
produce
chaos,
confusion
and
a
catastrophic
educational
set
back
to
the
children
involved.
the
administrative
difficulty
because
the
plans
have
not
yet
been
developed
and
here
is
the
prayer
that
is
now
made
in
their
request.
the
first
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
hearing
by
the
district
court
that
this
court
should
overrule
or
modify
brown
one,
brown
two,
cooper,
green,
ray,
and
all
the
other
cases
in
court
that's
above
this
court.
and
should
put
into
effect
plans
which
have
been
withdrawn
which
the
evidence
of
mr.
finch's
secretary,
of
mr.
jordan,
in
charge
of
that
area,
of
mr.
sutton's
who
was
his
assistant
were
not
sufficiently
developed
without
a
hearing
by
any
court
at
any
time
under
any
circumstances.
the
prayer
is
that
the
public
officials
who
are
charged
with
a
duty
of
administering
the
educational
system
within
these
states
should
not
be
permitted
to
participate
in
any
matter
in
the
preparation
of
or
collaboration
in
saying
the
plans.
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
defined
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
these
plans
which
the
system
were
drawn
were
presented
to
the
local
educational
authorities.
they
were
presented
with
the
statement
and
i
can
say
this
because
it
is
in
the
record
and
it's
understood
that
it
is
or
should
be
before
the
court.
i
was
present
when
it
was
done.
the
representative
as
the
record
shows
and
now
heard
with
the
statement
that
there
was
no
time
to
discuss
or
collaborate
concerning
them
or
to
work
out
difficulties
which
might
result
and
that
is
the
present
situation,
the
only
plans
now
in
own
file
are
those
which
were
filed
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
the
court
by
the
districts
themselves
under
the
renovation
that
they
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
fully
collaborate
with
the
department
and
to
work
out
plans
satisfactory
to
all
parties.
i
have
not
lost
my
temper
in
the
last
40
years
i've
been
practicing
law
except
twice
and
that
was
35
years
ago
and
did
not
do
so
today.
in
south,
you
know,
we
get
upset
if
we're
made
(inaudible).
but
come
almost
outside
when
i
hear
and
see
statements
made
of
constitutional
defiance
by
the
public
officials
of
mississippi
in
particular
of
the
schools.
the
fact
is
and
we
have
set
them
out
on
that
brief
beginning
with
1959,
1962,
1964,
1966
up
through
january
16,
1966.
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
fifth
circuit
was
that
freedom
of
choice
plan
to
work
proper,
they
should
be
extended
year
by
year
and
we
have
set
out
and
quoted
in
our
brief
the
latter
ones
which
were
that
since
a
late
start
had
been
made
in
13
districts
beginning
in
1965.
they
should
be
extended
to
four
grades
a
year
and
these
districts,
every
district
before
this
court
has
complied
with
those
requirements.
they
are
law
abiding
citizens
and
those
who
are
alleged
otherwise
do
so
being
i
hope
innocent
of
the
facts
to
be
most
charitable
to
them.
may
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
green,
of
course,
as
the
court
knows,
in
that
case,
freedom
of
choice
was
by
no
means
outlawed.
now,
by
the
way,
the
court
has
problems
that
noted
on
page
31
of
the
last
brief
filed
by
the
petitioners.
that
the
prayer
that
is
made
there
is
not
with
reference
to
desegregation.
the
prayer
is
as
follows
concerning
action
pendente
lite
that
this
court
should
make
the
action,
pendente
lite
“requiring
that
integration
and
not
segregation
be
the
status
quo
pendente
lite”.
or
in
other
words,
that
integration
and
not
desegregation
be
made
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
and
yet
this
court
said
in
green,
reaffirmed
in
carr
and
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
as
interpreted
by
this
court
as
follows,
that
is
we
do
not
hold
that
freedom
of
choice
can
have
no
place
in
such
a
plan.
we
do
not
hold
any
freedom
of
choice
plan
might
of
itself
be
unconstitutional
or
that
argument
has
been
urged
upon
us.
this
court
specifically
declined
so
to
hold
rather
all
way
that
said
today
is
that
in
desegregating
a
dual
system
a
plan
utilizing
a
freedom
of
choice
is
not
an
end
in
itself
and
then
yet
when
he
said,
there
are
two
words
used
in
many
cases
including
carr,
green,
monroe,
and
others.
thomas
(inaudible)
to
wait
and
the
word
“now.”
the
petitioner
said
the
word
“now”
means
yesterday,
have
already
worked
on
tomorrow
morning,
at
7:15
eastern
daylight
saving
time.
but
in
the
use
of
the
english
language,
the
word
promises
really
realistically
the
word
now
necessarily
force
to
the
realism
with
which
it
may
be
reasonably
expected
to
work
and
not
that
it
has
that
before
done
so.
and
set
this
court
in
green
where
if
the
freedom
of
choice
plan,
compose
a
real
promise
of
aiding
a
desegregation
program
to
effectuate
conversion
of
a
state-imposed
dual
system
to
a
unitary,
non-racial
system.
there
will
be
no
objection
to
allowing
such
a
device
to
improve
itself
at
operation.
no
objection
whatsoever
by
the
time
and
that
we
have
in
our
briefs
presented
to
you
three
illustrations
that
(inaudible)
because
the
petitioner
was
not
willing
for
the
court
to
have
the
full
record
report.
but
we
have
both
in
relation
to
the
cross-petition
found
under
the
exhibits
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
illustrations
of
the
meridian
school
district,
the
naches
school
district,
and
the
enterprise
school
district
demonstrated
that
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
is
nothing
like
tomorrow
there
will
be
a
ball
game,
football
game
in
neshoba
county
at
philadelphia,
mississippi
team
many,
or
some
years
ago
in
which
the
team
from
one
of
the
schools
here
involved
so-called
“white
schools”
will
have
opponent
almost
in
equal
number
of
negro
players
and
of
white
players.
we
have
shown
in
the
record
the
picture
of
the
all
state
negro
back
who
was
a
member
of
the
meridian
team
of
the
so-called
white
school.
now,
i
say
in
closing,
may
it
please
that
court
that
there
are
two
things
i
do
want
to
call
your
attention,
to
which
i
wish
to
call
your
attention.
the
first
is
i'm
somewhat
embarrass
after
reading
the
brief
to
admit
that
i'm
a
charter
member
of
the
lawyers'
committee
for
civil
rights
under
the
law.
i
was
the
one
who
arranged
for
them
to
open
in
august
in
jackson,
mississippi.
for
a
number
of
years,
they
did
a
very
fine
job,
a
reason
that
they
had
many
different
situations.
i
refer
you
to
my
brief
for
that
connection
and
the
connection
with
their
work.
that
other
is
this,
that
where
and
if
the
court
grants
the
prayer,
which
is
now
made
and
the
request
which
is
now
before
this
court
that
is
that
integration
shall
be
the
pendente
lite
shall
be
the
matter
of
the
day.
if
the
plans
that
i've
never
seen
those
files
or
what's
been
found
that
maybe
the
ones
i
saw
some
months
ago.
most
of
those
call
for
compulsory
assignment.
and
it's
interesting
that
in
order
to
have
compulsory
assignment,
it
does
have
to
be
a
tom
and
mary
and
jim
and
bill
by
name.
it
maybe,
it
maybe
compulsory
assignment
by
pairing
all
racial
grounds
only.
not
pairing
on
educational
ground,
but
pairing
what.
you
don't
call
jim
and
bill
by
name.
you
simply
say
everybody
in
the
class
that
jim
and
bill
is
going
to
shall
be
assigned
over
somewhere
else
to
compulsory
assignment.
proper
zoning
on
educational
grounds
is
certainly
recognized
and
there
has
been
by
this
and
over
the
courts.
but
zoning
on
racial
grounds
is
simply
saying,
you
don't
say
to
assign
compulsory
john
and
bill
or
to
pass
mary
and
sally
from
one
school
to
the
other.
you
set
a
draw
line
over
the
east
side
of
mary's
house
and
she
is
compelled
not
on
educational
grounds
but
on
racial
ground
alone
to
be
passed
over
to
some
other
school
and
that
is
the
prayer
which
is
now
before
us.
now,
if
that
was
to
be
carried
out,
that
would
bring
and
there
would
be
directed
as
there
is
in
the
adams
dicta
a
conflict
what
goes
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
which
in
our
brief.
i
will
not
attempt
to
read
it
to
you,
directly
so,
in
which
they
decline
to
fall
at
jefferson
one
or
two.
in
mapp
and
monroe
also
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
indeed
on
those
two
(inaudible)
or
dual
system
to
sets
into
one
was
a
de
facto
system.
there
would
be
a
direct
conflict
with
(inaudible)
of
the
little
rock
system
holding
that
compulsory
integration
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they
think
there
will
be
a
direct
conflict
during
that
which
is
requested
to
be
required
of
the
fifth
circuit
with
the
first
circuit
in
springfield
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
a
direct
conflict
was
cook
county
of
the
first
circuit
holding
directly
to
record
contrary
and
to
announce
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
kansas
city
holding
directed
to
the
contrary.
we
will
have
a
conflict
with
sixth
circuits
if
what
she
had
requested
is
granted.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
recognize
that
time
has
run
out
as
it
is
set.
deliberate
speed
is
no
longer
the
color
of
the
day.
any
plan
must
promise
realistic
to
work
and
promise
to
work
now,
realistically.
there
is
no
idea
of
delay.
the
request
to
delay
did
not
come
from
the
school
districts.
it
came
from
those
public
educators
of
the
united
states
of
america
who
found
that
the
claims
which
they
had
drawn
under
the
pressure
that
was
with
him
was
said
that
they
could
no
longer
recommend
and
as
counsel
has
stated,
asked
that
they
be
withdrawn.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
no.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
it
would
be
foreclosed
in
two
ways.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
in
my
judgment,
it
would.
but
there
are
two
ways.
first
is
they
asked
they'd
be
required
to
be
put
into
effect
pendente
lite
which
is
another
way
of
putting
them
immediately
into
effect
without
hearing,
without
an
opportunity
of
discuss
--
of
consideration
by
either
this
court
or
court
of
appeals
even
and
if
changes
such
as
those
--
broad
changes
such
those
which
were
suggested
are
made,
they
would
be
not
irreparable
but
irretrievable.
then
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
it
means,
if
what
they
asked
is
right,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
relief.
because
they
are
asking
that
the
district
court
should
not
be
permitted
to
have
any
hearing
but
that
their
experts
be
used
as
special
ministers
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
while
there
might
have
some
time
be
a
later
appeal,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
more
than
that
was
correct.
so,
i
do
believe
that
our
request
is
say
--
is
such
that
it
could
never
be
really.
we
take
the
position
that
one
of
the
distinguished
members
of
this
court
took
on
may
the
6th
1955,
mr.
justice
marshall.
when
he
said
in
brief
filed
in
brown
two.
the
negro
children
before
the
court
in
these
cases
are
entitled
of
public
education
on
a
non-segregated
basis.
the
only
way
the
relief
can
meaningfully
do
them
can
be
given
to
mean
to
them
is
to
abolish
the
policy
of
using
race
as
a
criterion
for
assignment
of
students.
thus,
the
only,
the
effective
decree
would
be
one
which
will
enjoin
the
use
of
race
in
the
assignment
of
any
pupils
in
the
school
districts
involved.
we
further
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
brief
in
brown
in
which
he
said,
“we
do
not
mean
to
be
understood
that
there
is
anything
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
it
makes
it
mandatory
that
pupils
be
given
a
choice
of
school.”
we
mean
that
the
elimination
of
compulsory
segregation
is
not
the
same
thing
as
compulsory
attendance
of
whites
at
negro
schools
or
negroes
at
white
schools.
negroes
and
whites
would
no
more
be
compelled
to
attend
the
same
schools
under
such
regulations
then
what
negroes
and
whites
compel
to
live
in
the
same
neighborhood
when
compulsory
residential
segregation
was
declared
invalid
in
buchanan
and
in
ward.
and
may
i
tell
this
court
frankly
that
if
and
when
the
court
has
the
opportunity
of
reading
this
record,
the
court
would
find
and
of
having
it
briefed
and
having
the
facts
before
you,
the
court
would
find
that
in
the
majority
of
these
issues,
and
the
great
majority,
the
vested
use
of
the
dual
school
system
have
been
removed
and
those
who
have
not
is
realistic
to
promises
the
way
comp
(ph),
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
civil
rights
movement
in
mississippi,
so
testified
as
one
of
these
particular
issues.
and
may
i
say
finally,
and
in
response
to
question
i
believe
of
--
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
question
of
the
number
of
years
or
the
question
of
status
of
individual
schools
is
a
national
question,
not
a
local
question.
and
you
will
find
on
page
64
of
our
brief,
a
listing
of
some
20
schools,
all
of
which
with
exception
of
one
which
is
in
texas,
on
a
northern,
eastern,
not
in
this
southern
area
and
in
which
ever
of
these
found
and
i
give
you
about
three
because
i
believe
that
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
in
chicago,
out
of
610
schools,
there
are
392
of
one
race
assuming
99%
or
more
is
of
one
race.
in
iowa,
there
are
36
out
of
81
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
in
new
your,
there
area
27
of
80
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
in
los
angeles,
california,
in
that
district,
out
of
591
schools,
359
are
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
and
finally,
in
new
york,
in
the
new
york
city
public
schools
out
of
853
schools,
158
are
composed
of
students
of
one
race
and
the
faculty
is
likewise.
therefore,
may
it
please
the
court
when
the
adams
dicta
says
that
if
any
one
of
these
three
things
exist,
schools
of
one
race,
a
small
portion
of
white
students
attending
former
--
no
white
students
then
from
negro
school,
a
small
portion
of
negro
students
attending
a
former
white
school,
or
a
small
number
of
teachers
of
the
asset
races.
freedom
of
choice
is
out
the
window.
it
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
green,
monroe
and
ray.
in
that
case,
as
we
put
out
in
the
brief,
and
with
this
i
recall,
there
were
18
matters
involving
administration
of
schools
considered
by
this
point
in
reaching
its
determination
that
those
particular
districts,
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
that
the
reasonable
premise
that
freedom
of
choice
would
work.
and
in
this
case
and
in
others,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
record
is
not
before
the
court
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
not
desired
by
the
petitioners
here.
one
statistic,
i
think
i
haven't
looked
that
up
yet.
i've
always
seen
statistics.
but
one
statistic
is
said
to
be
the
alternative
of
whether
the
vestiges
of
the
dual
system
are
being
removed.
we
feel
that
we
are
in
the
hands
of
the
greatest
review
in
the
world.
we
know
that
you
will
do
that
which
is
best
under
our
constitution.
we
feel
that
the
recommendation,
here
made
is
one
that
is
worthy
of
consideration
and
that
the
request
there
be
put
into
effect
immediately
that
the
matter
pendente
lite
be
integration
and
not
be
segregation.
that
plans
withdrawn
be
forced
in
immediately,
that
no
time
be
allowed
for
collaboration
between
h.e.w.
and
those
public
officials
charged
with
the
administration
of
schools
is
a
request
that
if
--
well,
i
would
say
this,
i
would
hesitate
to
make
such
a
request
myself.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
--
and
then
the
court.
it
is
a
pleasure
to
appear
before
you
today
in
this
connection
because
there
are
quite
a
number
of
matters
which
i
believe
need
to
be
cleared
off
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
the
litigants
and
of
the
children
here
involved.
the
first
is
this
that
this
procedure
has
been
handled
by
the
petitioners
in
the
same
way
they
handled
the
appearance
before
the
fifth
circuit
(inaudible)
which
was
purely
on
a
motion
consenting
a
docket
setting
at
which
time,
the
fifth
circuit
had
no
record
before
it,
no
evidence
before
it,
no
briefing
over
the
basic
merits,
briefing
only
as
to
timing
and
at
which
time,
the
fifth
circuit
pronounced
(inaudible)
which
has
later
been
referred
to
as
law
of
the
case.
secondly,
when
these
cases
appeared
as
heinz
county
before
the
fifth
circuit,
they
were
heard
upon
eight
days
notice.
the
record
was
in
four
packing
boxes
and
was
not
available
to
the
court
and
the
court
in
its
direction
of
october
25th
found.
it
did
not
intend
to
review
the
record
but
would
accept
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
all
matters
of
fact
which
with
deference
in
whole
affair
to
do.
this
proceeding
is
brought
without
the
record
before
the
court.
although
it
was
available
to
be
brought
even
within
the
time
limited
under
rules
20
and
12
of
this
court
and
rule
11
of
the
rule
of
the
federal
procedures.
and
this
is
again
an
attempt
to
make
broad
statements
not
supported
by
the
record
because
there
is
no
record.
for
instance,
the
statement
had
been
made
to
some
3,000
pages
of
testimony
and
most
of
which
was
directed
toward
the
allegation
there's
a
difference
in
the
intelligence
of
negro
and
white
children.
that
statement
is
absolutely
without
any
foundation
is
in
fact,
in
fact
and
contrary
to
the
truth.
the
record
contains
evidence
demonstrating
compliance
by
many
of
these
districts
with
the
requirements
not
only
of
the
cases
throughout
the
years
but
the
green,
ray,
monroe
and
carr.
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
go
into
the
illustration.
we
had
the
time
to
bring
before
this
court
but
in
the
meridian
district,
in
athletics,
in
activities,
in
faculty,
in
participation
of
students,
it
is
demonstrated
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
longer
a
dual
system
but
there
is
a
unitary
system.
and
mrs.
comp
(ph)
a
leader
of
the
naacp
of
the
southern
christian
leadership
commerce
of
the
black
methodist
who
has
been
active
in
all
civil
rights
movements
in
meridian
for
the
last
31
years
testified
the
system
was
unitary,
that
there
was
a
complete
right
of
attendance
of
all
students
to
every
school
and
that
in
whole
opinion,
it
was
working
and
would
continue
to
work.
and
there
is
evidence
throughout
this
record
if
petitioners
were
willing
for
the
court
to
have
the
opportunity
of
saying
it,
of
that
nature,
applicable
to
most
of
these
issues.
they
differ
in
many,
very
different
ways.
may
i
call
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
it
has
been
stated
to
this
court,
we
did
not
know
until
when
you
read
the
brief
we
received
saturday
morning
after
office
close
as
the
statement
on
page
approximate
23
thereof,
they
would
be
made
available
to
the
court
copies
of
certain
plans.
we've
never
seen
what
was
handed
to
the
court
but
we've
seen
plans
that
were
filed.
i
assume
that
may
be
it.
but
it
should
be
noted
that
in
this
matter
the
petitioners
bring
piece
by
piece
that
would
say
what
the
court
to
see
but
have
asked
the
court
to
pass
upon
this
matter
without
there
being
before
the
court
the
record
of
the
court
which
was
available
to
them
and
could
be
brought.
and
what
do
they
ask?
their
prayer
appears
on
pages
30
and
31
of
their
present
brief
and
that
is
one
that
was
the
most
amazing,
it
frankly
may
it
please
the
court,
it
made
both
of
our
state
(inaudible)
stand
up.
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
before.
in
the
first
place,
it
asked
this
court
to
require
that
they'd
be
put
into
effect
plans
which
have
been
withdrawn.
withdrawn
by
whom
under
own
allegations,
withdrawn
by
the
department
of
education,
health,
and
welfare
and
the
secretary
of
finance
extra
full
consideration
thereof.
they
have
been,
as
demonstrated
by
(inaudible),
he
found
that
they
were
not
sufficient.
that
was
reported
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
jordan
and
of
mr.
--
of
the
other
gentleman
who
testified.
this
gentleman,
mr.
solons,
one
of
the
top
employees
of
h.e.w
testified
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
assigned
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
witness
was
of
the
opinion
and
the
court
defines
that
in
order
to
formulate,
not
implement,
to
formulate
and
implement
successful
and
you
think
that
desegregation
plans,
their
additional
time
will
be
required.
now,
a
record
was
made
to
the
chaos
which
might
result
as
if
it
had
to
do
with
community
resistance.
that
is
another
matter
in
which
there's
an
attempt
to
give
an
erroneous
idea
to
this
court
to
put
it
in
a
most
charitable
way.
the
statement
of
the
secretary
is
as
follows
to
which
appeared
on
page
31
(e)
of
the
petitioner,
in
the
letter
written
by
the
secretary.
and
by
the
way,
that
came
into
the
court
as
an
exhibit
to
the
motion.
there's
no
attempt
to
have
an
indefinite
postpone
of
anything.
the
secretary's
obligation
solely
was
to
file
and
formulate
plans
before
the
action
would
be
taken
by
the
court
with
the
assistance
of
the
department
of
justice
(inaudible)
and
when
that
letter
came
to
chief
justice
john
brown
and
chief
district
judge
cox.
it
came
as
a
part
of
a
motion
setting
forth
timing
similar,
almost
identical
to
that
in
the
original
order
of
july
3rd
and
july
25th
with
the
exception
of
the
necessary
time
to
do
what?
not
to
implement
plans
but
to
form
proper
things.
now,
here's
what
mr.
finch
say.
he
says,
“i'm
gravely
concerned
that
the
time
allowed
for
the
development
of
these
terminal
plans
has
been
too
short
for
the
educators
of
the
office
of
education
to
develop
terminal
plans
which
can
be
implemented
this
year.”
the
administrative
and
what
is
here
before
right
you,
is
he
talking
about
community
as
has
been
stated
in
the
brief
erroneously
and
without
any
basis
whatsoever
without
the
record
being
before
the
court.
he
says,
the
administrative
and
logistical
difficulties,
the
administrative
which
must
be
encountered
and
made
in
the
terribly
short
space
of
time
must
surely
in
my
judgment
produce
chaos,
confusion
and
a
catastrophic
educational
set
back
to
the
children
involved.
the
administrative
difficulty
because
the
plans
have
not
yet
been
developed
and
here
is
the
prayer
that
is
now
made
in
their
request.
the
first
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
hearing
by
the
district
court
that
this
court
should
overrule
or
modify
brown
one,
brown
two,
cooper,
green,
ray,
and
all
the
other
cases
in
court
that's
above
this
court.
and
should
put
into
effect
plans
which
have
been
withdrawn
which
the
evidence
of
mr.
finch's
secretary,
of
mr.
jordan,
in
charge
of
that
area,
of
mr.
sutton's
who
was
his
assistant
were
not
sufficiently
developed
without
a
hearing
by
any
court
at
any
time
under
any
circumstances.
the
prayer
is
that
the
public
officials
who
are
charged
with
a
duty
of
administering
the
educational
system
within
these
states
should
not
be
permitted
to
participate
in
any
matter
in
the
preparation
of
or
collaboration
in
saying
the
plans.
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
defined
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
these
plans
which
the
system
were
drawn
were
presented
to
the
local
educational
authorities.
they
were
presented
with
the
statement
and
i
can
say
this
because
it
is
in
the
record
and
it's
understood
that
it
is
or
should
be
before
the
court.
i
was
present
when
it
was
done.
the
representative
as
the
record
shows
and
now
heard
with
the
statement
that
there
was
no
time
to
discuss
or
collaborate
concerning
them
or
to
work
out
difficulties
which
might
result
and
that
is
the
present
situation,
the
only
plans
now
in
own
file
are
those
which
were
filed
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
the
court
by
the
districts
themselves
under
the
renovation
that
they
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
fully
collaborate
with
the
department
and
to
work
out
plans
satisfactory
to
all
parties.
i
have
not
lost
my
temper
in
the
last
40
years
i've
been
practicing
law
except
twice
and
that
was
35
years
ago
and
did
not
do
so
today.
in
south,
you
know,
we
get
upset
if
we're
made
(inaudible).
but
come
almost
outside
when
i
hear
and
see
statements
made
of
constitutional
defiance
by
the
public
officials
of
mississippi
in
particular
of
the
schools.
the
fact
is
and
we
have
set
them
out
on
that
brief
beginning
with
1959,
1962,
1964,
1966
up
through
january
16,
1966.
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
fifth
circuit
was
that
freedom
of
choice
plan
to
work
proper,
they
should
be
extended
year
by
year
and
we
have
set
out
and
quoted
in
our
brief
the
latter
ones
which
were
that
since
a
late
start
had
been
made
in
13
districts
beginning
in
1965.
they
should
be
extended
to
four
grades
a
year
and
these
districts,
every
district
before
this
court
has
complied
with
those
requirements.
they
are
law
abiding
citizens
and
those
who
are
alleged
otherwise
do
so
being
i
hope
innocent
of
the
facts
to
be
most
charitable
to
them.
may
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
green,
of
course,
as
the
court
knows,
in
that
case,
freedom
of
choice
was
by
no
means
outlawed.
now,
by
the
way,
the
court
has
problems
that
noted
on
page
31
of
the
last
brief
filed
by
the
petitioners.
that
the
prayer
that
is
made
there
is
not
with
reference
to
desegregation.
the
prayer
is
as
follows
concerning
action
pendente
lite
that
this
court
should
make
the
action,
pendente
lite
“requiring
that
integration
and
not
segregation
be
the
status
quo
pendente
lite”.
or
in
other
words,
that
integration
and
not
desegregation
be
made
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
and
yet
this
court
said
in
green,
reaffirmed
in
carr
and
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
as
interpreted
by
this
court
as
follows,
that
is
we
do
not
hold
that
freedom
of
choice
can
have
no
place
in
such
a
plan.
we
do
not
hold
any
freedom
of
choice
plan
might
of
itself
be
unconstitutional
or
that
argument
has
been
urged
upon
us.
this
court
specifically
declined
so
to
hold
rather
all
way
that
said
today
is
that
in
desegregating
a
dual
system
a
plan
utilizing
a
freedom
of
choice
is
not
an
end
in
itself
and
then
yet
when
he
said,
there
are
two
words
used
in
many
cases
including
carr,
green,
monroe,
and
others.
thomas
(inaudible)
to
wait
and
the
word
“now.”
the
petitioner
said
the
word
“now”
means
yesterday,
have
already
worked
on
tomorrow
morning,
at
7:15
eastern
daylight
saving
time.
but
in
the
use
of
the
english
language,
the
word
promises
really
realistically
the
word
now
necessarily
force
to
the
realism
with
which
it
may
be
reasonably
expected
to
work
and
not
that
it
has
that
before
done
so.
and
set
this
court
in
green
where
if
the
freedom
of
choice
plan,
compose
a
real
promise
of
aiding
a
desegregation
program
to
effectuate
conversion
of
a
state-imposed
dual
system
to
a
unitary,
non-racial
system.
there
will
be
no
objection
to
allowing
such
a
device
to
improve
itself
at
operation.
no
objection
whatsoever
by
the
time
and
that
we
have
in
our
briefs
presented
to
you
three
illustrations
that
(inaudible)
because
the
petitioner
was
not
willing
for
the
court
to
have
the
full
record
report.
but
we
have
both
in
relation
to
the
cross-petition
found
under
the
exhibits
to
our
brief
in
this
case.
illustrations
of
the
meridian
school
district,
the
naches
school
district,
and
the
enterprise
school
district
demonstrated
that
the
freedom
of
choice
plan
is
nothing
like
tomorrow
there
will
be
a
ball
game,
football
game
in
neshoba
county
at
philadelphia,
mississippi
team
many,
or
some
years
ago
in
which
the
team
from
one
of
the
schools
here
involved
so-called
“white
schools”
will
have
opponent
almost
in
equal
number
of
negro
players
and
of
white
players.
we
have
shown
in
the
record
the
picture
of
the
all
state
negro
back
who
was
a
member
of
the
meridian
team
of
the
so-called
white
school.
now,
i
say
in
closing,
may
it
please
that
court
that
there
are
two
things
i
do
want
to
call
your
attention,
to
which
i
wish
to
call
your
attention.
the
first
is
i'm
somewhat
embarrass
after
reading
the
brief
to
admit
that
i'm
a
charter
member
of
the
lawyers'
committee
for
civil
rights
under
the
law.
i
was
the
one
who
arranged
for
them
to
open
in
august
in
jackson,
mississippi.
for
a
number
of
years,
they
did
a
very
fine
job,
a
reason
that
they
had
many
different
situations.
i
refer
you
to
my
brief
for
that
connection
and
the
connection
with
their
work.
that
other
is
this,
that
where
and
if
the
court
grants
the
prayer,
which
is
now
made
and
the
request
which
is
now
before
this
court
that
is
that
integration
shall
be
the
pendente
lite
shall
be
the
matter
of
the
day.
if
the
plans
that
i've
never
seen
those
files
or
what's
been
found
that
maybe
the
ones
i
saw
some
months
ago.
most
of
those
call
for
compulsory
assignment.
and
it's
interesting
that
in
order
to
have
compulsory
assignment,
it
does
have
to
be
a
tom
and
mary
and
jim
and
bill
by
name.
it
maybe,
it
maybe
compulsory
assignment
by
pairing
all
racial
grounds
only.
not
pairing
on
educational
ground,
but
pairing
what.
you
don't
call
jim
and
bill
by
name.
you
simply
say
everybody
in
the
class
that
jim
and
bill
is
going
to
shall
be
assigned
over
somewhere
else
to
compulsory
assignment.
proper
zoning
on
educational
grounds
is
certainly
recognized
and
there
has
been
by
this
and
over
the
courts.
but
zoning
on
racial
grounds
is
simply
saying,
you
don't
say
to
assign
compulsory
john
and
bill
or
to
pass
mary
and
sally
from
one
school
to
the
other.
you
set
a
draw
line
over
the
east
side
of
mary's
house
and
she
is
compelled
not
on
educational
grounds
but
on
racial
ground
alone
to
be
passed
over
to
some
other
school
and
that
is
the
prayer
which
is
now
before
us.
now,
if
that
was
to
be
carried
out,
that
would
bring
and
there
would
be
directed
as
there
is
in
the
adams
dicta
a
conflict
what
goes
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
which
in
our
brief.
i
will
not
attempt
to
read
it
to
you,
directly
so,
in
which
they
decline
to
fall
at
jefferson
one
or
two.
in
mapp
and
monroe
also
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
indeed
on
those
two
(inaudible)
or
dual
system
to
sets
into
one
was
a
de
facto
system.
there
would
be
a
direct
conflict
with
(inaudible)
of
the
little
rock
system
holding
that
compulsory
integration
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they
think
there
will
be
a
direct
conflict
during
that
which
is
requested
to
be
required
of
the
fifth
circuit
with
the
first
circuit
in
springfield
quoted
in
our
brief.
and
a
direct
conflict
was
cook
county
of
the
first
circuit
holding
directly
to
record
contrary
and
to
announce
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
kansas
city
holding
directed
to
the
contrary.
we
will
have
a
conflict
with
sixth
circuits
if
what
she
had
requested
is
granted.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
recognize
that
time
has
run
out
as
it
is
set.
deliberate
speed
is
no
longer
the
color
of
the
day.
any
plan
must
promise
realistic
to
work
and
promise
to
work
now,
realistically.
there
is
no
idea
of
delay.
the
request
to
delay
did
not
come
from
the
school
districts.
it
came
from
those
public
educators
of
the
united
states
of
america
who
found
that
the
claims
which
they
had
drawn
under
the
pressure
that
was
with
him
was
said
that
they
could
no
longer
recommend
and
as
counsel
has
stated,
asked
that
they
be
withdrawn.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
no.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
it
would
be
foreclosed
in
two
ways.
mr.
john
c.
satterfield
in
my
judgment,
it
would.
but
there
are
two
ways.
first
is
they
asked
they'd
be
required
to
be
put
into
effect
pendente
lite
which
is
another
way
of
putting
them
immediately
into
effect
without
hearing,
without
an
opportunity
of
discuss
--
of
consideration
by
either
this
court
or
court
of
appeals
even
and
if
changes
such
as
those
--
broad
changes
such
those
which
were
suggested
are
made,
they
would
be
not
irreparable
but
irretrievable.
then
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
it
means,
if
what
they
asked
is
right,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
relief.
because
they
are
asking
that
the
district
court
should
not
be
permitted
to
have
any
hearing
but
that
their
experts
be
used
as
special
ministers
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
while
there
might
have
some
time
be
a
later
appeal,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
more
than
that
was
correct.
so,
i
do
believe
that
our
request
is
say
--
is
such
that
it
could
never
be
really.
we
take
the
position
that
one
of
the
distinguished
members
of
this
court
took
on
may
the
6th
1955,
mr.
justice
marshall.
when
he
said
in
brief
filed
in
brown
two.
the
negro
children
before
the
court
in
these
cases
are
entitled
of
public
education
on
a
non-segregated
basis.
the
only
way
the
relief
can
meaningfully
do
them
can
be
given
to
mean
to
them
is
to
abolish
the
policy
of
using
race
as
a
criterion
for
assignment
of
students.
thus,
the
only,
the
effective
decree
would
be
one
which
will
enjoin
the
use
of
race
in
the
assignment
of
any
pupils
in
the
school
districts
involved.
we
further
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
brief
in
brown
in
which
he
said,
“we
do
not
mean
to
be
understood
that
there
is
anything
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
it
makes
it
mandatory
that
pupils
be
given
a
choice
of
school.”
we
mean
that
the
elimination
of
compulsory
segregation
is
not
the
same
thing
as
compulsory
attendance
of
whites
at
negro
schools
or
negroes
at
white
schools.
negroes
and
whites
would
no
more
be
compelled
to
attend
the
same
schools
under
such
regulations
then
what
negroes
and
whites
compel
to
live
in
the
same
neighborhood
when
compulsory
residential
segregation
was
declared
invalid
in
buchanan
and
in
ward.
and
may
i
tell
this
court
frankly
that
if
and
when
the
court
has
the
opportunity
of
reading
this
record,
the
court
would
find
and
of
having
it
briefed
and
having
the
facts
before
you,
the
court
would
find
that
in
the
majority
of
these
issues,
and
the
great
majority,
the
vested
use
of
the
dual
school
system
have
been
removed
and
those
who
have
not
is
realistic
to
promises
the
way
comp
(ph),
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
civil
rights
movement
in
mississippi,
so
testified
as
one
of
these
particular
issues.
and
may
i
say
finally,
and
in
response
to
question
i
believe
of
--
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
question
of
the
number
of
years
or
the
question
of
status
of
individual
schools
is
a
national
question,
not
a
local
question.
and
you
will
find
on
page
64
of
our
brief,
a
listing
of
some
20
schools,
all
of
which
with
exception
of
one
which
is
in
texas,
on
a
northern,
eastern,
not
in
this
southern
area
and
in
which
ever
of
these
found
and
i
give
you
about
three
because
i
believe
that
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
in
chicago,
out
of
610
schools,
there
are
392
of
one
race
assuming
99%
or
more
is
of
one
race.
in
iowa,
there
are
36
out
of
81
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
in
new
your,
there
area
27
of
80
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
in
los
angeles,
california,
in
that
district,
out
of
591
schools,
359
are
composed
of
students
of
one
race.
and
finally,
in
new
york,
in
the
new
york
city
public
schools
out
of
853
schools,
158
are
composed
of
students
of
one
race
and
the
faculty
is
likewise.
therefore,
may
it
please
the
court
when
the
adams
dicta
says
that
if
any
one
of
these
three
things
exist,
schools
of
one
race,
a
small
portion
of
white
students
attending
former
--
no
white
students
then
from
negro
school,
a
small
portion
of
negro
students
attending
a
former
white
school,
or
a
small
number
of
teachers
of
the
asset
races.
freedom
of
choice
is
out
the
window.
it
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
green,
monroe
and
ray.
in
that
case,
as
we
put
out
in
the
brief,
and
with
this
i
recall,
there
were
18
matters
involving
administration
of
schools
considered
by
this
point
in
reaching
its
determination
that
those
particular
districts,
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
that
the
reasonable
premise
that
freedom
of
choice
would
work.
and
in
this
case
and
in
others,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
the
record
is
not
before
the
court
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
not
desired
by
the
petitioners
here.
one
statistic,
i
think
i
haven't
looked
that
up
yet.
i've
always
seen
statistics.
but
one
statistic
is
said
to
be
the
alternative
of
whether
the
vestiges
of
the
dual
system
are
being
removed.
we
feel
that
we
are
in
the
hands
of
the
greatest
review
in
the
world.
we
know
that
you
will
do
that
which
is
best
under
our
constitution.
we
feel
that
the
recommendation,
here
made
is
one
that
is
worthy
of
consideration
and
that
the
request
there
be
put
into
effect
immediately
that
the
matter
pendente
lite
be
integration
and
not
be
segregation.
that
plans
withdrawn
be
forced
in
immediately,
that
no
time
be
allowed
for
collaboration
between
h.e.w.
and
those
public
officials
charged
with
the
administration
of
schools
is
a
request
that
if
--
well,
i
would
say
this,
i
would
hesitate
to
make
such
a
request
myself.
thank
you
very
much.
