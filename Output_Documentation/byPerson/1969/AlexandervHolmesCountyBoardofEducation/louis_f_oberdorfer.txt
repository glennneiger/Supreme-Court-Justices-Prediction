mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
with
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
under
a
law
which
has
filed
a
memorandum
as
amicus
curiae
by
leave
of
court
and
participates
and
briefly
in
the
oral
argument
by
the
consent
of
the
petitioners
who
have
see
this
some
time.
this
committee
was
organized
in
june
1963
under
the
co-chairmanship
of
the
late
harrison
tweed
and
of
bernard
segal
of
philadelphia.
they
and
about
45
other
members
of
the
bar,
leaders
of
the
bar
had
formed
the
nucleus
of
this
committee.
when
they
joined
in
a
public
appeal
for
peaceful
compliance
with
the
court
orders
with
respect
to
the
desegregation
of
the
university
of
alabama,
these
gentlemen
had
been
concerned
about
the
failure
of
many
leaders
of
the
bar
to
involve
themselves
as
citizen
lawyers
at
the
time
of
the
enforcement
of
court
orders
with
respect
to
little
rock
arkansas
and
earlier
in
--
later
in
september
1962
at
the
university
of
mississippi.
their
purpose
and
their
interest
in
this
case
is
because
--
is
in
pursuit
of
their
objective
of
committing
the
prestige
and
skills
of
private
lawyers
to
creating
and
preserving
an
atmosphere
which
will
facilitate
prompt
and
graceful
if
not
cheerful
obedience
to
court
orders
on
the
subject
of
desegregation.
since
the
formation
of
the
committee
and
since
these
lawyers
have
began
to
speak
out
as
mr.
greenberg
suggest.
there
has
been
less
of
a
vigorous
resistance
to
these
orders
more
graceful
compliance.
schools
and
such
places
as
bogalusa,
louisiana
had
been
the
subject
of
orders
for
reorganization
of
dual
school
systems
and
to
unitary
school
systems
which
orders
have
been
honored
and
obeyed.
recalling
the
committee's
continuing
role
and
interest
in
this
aspect
to
the
administration
of
justice.
it
became
concern
that
the
actions
of
the
lower
courts
and
accounts
at
least
of
some
of
the
actions
of
the
united
states
during
dependency
of
these
proceedings
might
tend
to
cost
an
unraveling
of
the
atmosphere
of
respect
which
has
been
developed
over
this
recent
hard
years.
we
were
heartened
by
this
court's
prompt
action
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
that
the
case
is
here,
we
have
some
suggestions
as
amicus
curiae
on
the
merits
primarily
as
respect
to
remedy.
our
suggestion
to
the
court
in
general
is
that
the
decision
and
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
august
1969
should
be
affirmed
insofar
as
it
orders
a
reorganization
of
the
dual
school
system
in
these
districts
into
a
unitary
school
system.
but
the
august
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
unlike
the
july
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
not
only
set
back
for
90
days,
the
period
for
formulation
of
plans
but
it
failed
to
do
what
the
july
order
had
done
namely
to
prescribe
in
addition
to
--
to
prescribe
not
only
dates
for
formulation
of
plan
but
also
precise
dates
for
the
commencement
of
implementation
and
we
would
suggest
an
order
or
mandate
the
direct
of
a
further
order
a
precise
date
for
the
completion
or
at
least
substantial
progress
toward
the
completion
of
the
decentralization
plan.
performing
dates,
an
order
that
prescribes
dates
not
only
for
formulation
of
the
plan
but
for
performance
of
the
plan.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
your
honor
we
are
--
we
have
not
been
in
this
litigation.
we
haven't
been
in
the
crucible
of
detail
about
it.
we
really
can't
make
a
responsible
suggestion
for
particular
dates.
we
do
suggest
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
found
--
i
refer
to
page
37-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
no
consideration
should
be
given
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
in
this
respect.
no
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
fact
of
interrupting
the
school
year
in
the
event
that
further
relief
is
indicated.
we
wanted
to
suggest
to
the
court
in
appraising
the
mandate
that
--
and
the
united
states
in
its
last
memorandum
concedes
as
much
that
there
is
no
reason
to
worry
too
much
about
having
this
done
before
summer.
as
we
--
we
would
like
to
suggest
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
administration
of
justice,
from
the
point
of
view
of
law
enforcement
if
you
will,
that
there
are
--
nobody
is
an
expert
on
this
i
suppose
but
they
are
good
reasons
to
believe
that
the
reorganization
of
the
schools
can
be
better
accomplished
during
the
school
year
when
the
students
are
in
school,
when
the
teachers
are
in
school,
when
the
courts
are
in
daily
business,
when
this
court
is
in
session.
then
would
be
possible
if
we
had
what's
happened
over
and
over
again
in
so
many
school
districts.
this
is
not
a
decided
more
or
less
in
rhetoric
in
the
spring
as
happened
in
this
case,
then
the
summer
doldrums
set
in
and
then
about
august
when
everybody
really
concern
is
on
holiday,
we
suddenly
--
law
enforcement
people,
court,
school
administrators,
teachers,
students
are
suddenly
confronted
with
the
whatever
activity
goes
on
to
try
to
delay
past
opening
of
school.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
--
the
first
--
to
set
these
things
down
for
the
first
day
of
school
is
an
invitation
to
whoever
would
try
to
interfere,
to
--
on
the
theory
that
if
they
could
just
get
by
that
1st
day
of
september
then
they
are
home
free
for
another
year.
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
page
37-a.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
the
possible
interpretation
your
honor.
i
think
there
was
--
i
really
think
they
were
saying
that
--
probably
not
saying
anymore
that
what
i
was
trying
to
say
namely
that
whenever
you
do
it,
don't
worry
about
waiting
until
june
in
order
to
do
it.
don't
worry
about
waiting
until
september
when
in
the
normal
course
of
hopefully
expedited
litigation,
an
expedited
effort
by
the
administrate
--
by
the
executive
branch,
the
matter
is
ready
to
go
and
the
plan
is
completed.
go
ahead
with
it
and
if
it
happens
to
be
the
3rd
day
of
november,
go
ahead
on
the
3rd
day
of
november.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
it's
possible
that
that
means
that
no
stay
â€“
might
mean
that
no
stay
of
the
order
effective
september
1st
will
be
granted
simply
because
there
may
be
a
later
interruption
of
the
school
year.
in
any
event,
that
the
government's
memorandum
of
yesterday
says
and
we
believe
that
the
courts
below
my
properly
be
authorized
to
require
the
implementation
of
the
plans
commencing
at
the
most
practical
eminent
juncture
in
the
school
year.
now,
i
have
two
suggestion
about
that,
one
is
perhaps
instead
of
authorizing
the
courts
below
to
require
implementation
of
the
plans
as
i
read
that
sometime
during
the
school
year
that
this
courts
mandate
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
enter
an
order
to
that
effect.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
without
knowing
exactly
what
now
is
as
to
now.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
had
thought
and
i
don't
mean
to
[laughter].
if
you
do
your
honor,
i
had
thought
that
that
--
that
the
order
could
well
be
an
order
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
direct
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order
and
that
for
that
length
of
time
for
the
mandate
to
get
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
then,
it
would
be
appropriate
if
that's
the
decision.
in
any
event,
that
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
school
year
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
correct
and
furthermore
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
faster
than
that
your
honor.
thank
you.[laughter]
