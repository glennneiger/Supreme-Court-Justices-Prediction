mr.
a.
f.
summer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
trial
of
these
cases
below.
i've
been
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
for
just
a
few
months
and
therefore
have
not
previously
participated
in
any
of
these
school
cases.
so,
with
the
court's
permission,
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
take
a
very
few
minutes
to
the
remainder
of
our
time
and
pass
the
argument
then
to
the
honorable
john
satterfield
who
has
participated
in
these
cases
from
the
beginning
and
who
will
be
better
qualified
to
answer
any
of
your
specific
question
regarding
these
specific
cases
and
with
your
permission,
i
would
refer
to
him
for
same.
just
a
few
commentaries
in
regard
to
the
say
the
least
loose
statement
made
for
the
counsel
that
the
law
has
disobeyed
and
the
courts
have
not
required
obedience.
that's
carrying
the
--
therefore,
i
believe
the
something
that
does
not
appear
in
this
record
nor
in
my
opinion
in
any
other
record
of
the
court
below.
he
has
not
--
this
record
will
not
show
any
disobedience
of
the
court
or
other
court
orders
in
this
case,
nor
do
i
believe
that
would
show
that
the
judge
has
refused
to
require
the
obedience
to
those.
and
further,
to
counsel's
extreme
reluctance,
to
have
the
same
standards
applied
to
all
of
the
schools
in
the
nation
that
apply
to
those
in
the
area
in
which
we
live.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
point
out
our
part
of
the
evidence
in
these
cases
below
that
addresses
itself
to
that
point.
the
record
in
these
cases
contain
absolute
proof
taken
from
the
h.e.w
files
that
there
are
hundreds
of
all-negro
and
all-white
schools
in
the
de
facto
areas
which
was
being
inquired
about
this
moment
ago.
they
are
all-negro
and
all-white
because
of
the
living
patterns
and
other
factors.
we
feel
we
no
longer
have
the
issue
of
segregated
schools
but
de
facto,
just
as
those
and
other
parts
of
the
nations
just
as
their
schools
are.
how
much
longer
can
it
be
fairly
said
that
chicago
with
610
schools
can
have
208
all-negro
schools,
184
all-white
schools
and
228
schools
with
no
negro
teachers.
but
each
of
these
schools
before
the
court
must
affirmatively
or
forcefully
in
agree
to
each
of
their
schools
summarily
without
hearing
both
students
and
faculty
whether
it
is
right
for
the
students
or
not.
well,
st.
louis
with
its
164
schools,
83
of
which
are
black
and
31
of
which
are
all-white,
81
of
which
either
have
or
have
either
all-black
or
all
white
teachers,
continued
except
from
this
new
constitutional
principle
they
are
advocated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
proven
in
the
record
of
these
cases
of
the
12,497
and
the
100
largest
school
districts
in
the
nation,
assuming
that
a
school
with
less
than
one
percent
of
the
minority
race
is
a
in
all-negro
or
all-white
school,
6,137
are
48%
are
either
all-black
or
all-white.
these
are
schools
that
have
never
had
a
dual
system.
our
record
in
the
hold
is
no
worst
than
what
seems
to
be
the
national
average.
the
advocates
here
would
have
these
children
into
--
these
children
involved
in
these
lawsuits,
135,720
children
endure
a
discriminatory
application
of
a
constitutional
standard,
that
is
not
applied
universally
in
this
country.
with
that,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
defer
to
mr.
satterfield
for
the
balance
of
the
argument.
