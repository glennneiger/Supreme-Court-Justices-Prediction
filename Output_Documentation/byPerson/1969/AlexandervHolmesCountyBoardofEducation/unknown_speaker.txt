what
--
where
are
you
reading
counsel?
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
there
mr.
greenberg,
this
would
mean
that
did
many
children
would
change
schools
and
teachers
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
and
in
fact,
they
would
be
reassigned?
unknown
speaker
what
would
have
--
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
do
or
how
would
it
say
a
child
is
going
to
a
school,
one
school
and
then
under
this
plan
will
be
going
to
another
school
to
different
teacher.
what
would
be
the
diff
--
would
that
be
--
pose
any
difficulty
at
all
in
terms
of
his
completing
his
work
that
year
or
--
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
the
children
now
going
to
the
schools
in
these
districts
would
be
changing
schools
and
teachers,
more
than
50%
or
90%?
unknown
speaker
with
the
large
number,
large
percentage
--
unknown
speaker
and
teachers
likewise
would
be
changing
the
school?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
going
to
say
i
didn't
read
his
brief
that
way.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
do
you
file
that
objection
with
exception
to
the
original
part
of
the
deal
is
to
strengthen
the
plans?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
what
date
do
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand,
i
think
i
do
that
you
had
agreed
with
what
mr.
greenberg
suggested
that
the
thing
to
do
is
to
say
dual
system
is
old
and
it
is
to
go
effect
today
and
that
there
is
no
reason
for
delay
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
things
will
not
be
perfect
the
first
day
and
the
thing
to
do
is
to
go
at
it
now,
do
you
agree
with
his
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
when
we
issue
an
order
if
we
do.
unknown
speaker
then?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
on
future
is
that
deliberate
speed?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
would
like
to
have
us
act
with
all
deliberate
speed?
unknown
speaker
the
green
throughout
the
freedom
of
choice
was.
unknown
speaker
too
many
plans,
not
enough
action
made.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
something
straight
here.
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
i
do
not
understand
after
the
proposal
of
your
opponents,
of
the
things
and
these
plans
that
you
have
been
criticize
would
be
foreclosed
from
objection
and
ultimate
review
by
this
court
if
necessary
if
their
proposal
wanted
to
effect
the
issue,
do
i
misunderstand
it?

you
said
it
would
be
foreclosed.
