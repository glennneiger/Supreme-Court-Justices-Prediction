justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
what
kind
of
order
you
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
concrete.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
they
be
exempted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
on
effect
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
understood,
have
to
be
understood
that
you
got
to
go
through
certain
mechanical
steps
and
you'd
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
system
of
your
school
be
ended
immediately?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
regard
to
buildings
and
as
the
buildings
are
unsatisfactory,
they
do
the
best
they
can
under
such
improvements
that
can
be
made
there
perhaps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
terribly
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
the
brief
of
the
american
educational
association?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
it
or
disagree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
have
to
have
a
plan
to
just
say,
we're
not
going
to
have
a
delayed
session?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
do
anything
except
delay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
do
it
and
put
it
in
effect
and
let
the
arrangements
be
made
thereafter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
start
it
in
each
one
of
these
schools
and
said
now
we're
not
going
to
have
any
dual
system
of
schools.
there's
going
to
be
unity.
and
if
the
buildings
don't
suit,
we'll
do
the
best
we
can
with
the
buildings
we
have.
we'll
do
the
best
we
can
with
the
teachers
here.
why
have
to
draw
any
other
plans
but
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
asking
you
why
that
view
is
right
and
whether
it's
right
or
not.
who's
ever
view
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
frustrations
from
the
15
years,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
to
divide
it
up
into
segments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
to
divide
it
up
into

justice
hugo
l.
black
would
anything
--
would
anything
be
precipitous
in
this
appeal
now?
with
all
the
years
gone
by?
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
our
order
was
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing
for
perpetuation
of
the

speed?
justice
hugo

mr.

such
a
