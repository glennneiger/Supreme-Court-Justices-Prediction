mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
involved
the
issue
of
the
timing
of
desegregation
of
14
mississippi
school
districts
and
the
procedure
by
which
is
to
be
accomplished.
the
basic
issue
here
is
how
much
longer
negro
school
children
in
these
cases
in
14
mississippi
school
districts
must
wait
to
realize
their
constitutional
right
to
attend
desegregated
school
systems
required
by
this
court
more
than
15
years
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
basic
issue
here
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
is
how
much
longer
negro
school
children
in
these
districts
must
wait
to
realize
their
constitutional
right
to
attend
desegregated
schools
decreed
by
this
court
more
than
15
years
ago.
the
law
has
been
disobeyed
by
respondent
districts
and
the
courts
below
have
not
required
obedience.
we
submit
that
the
issues
must
be
seen
in
historical
context.
for
only
in
that
context
is
it
apparent
why
as
we
urge
that
this
court's
expression
on
timing
must
be
unequivocal
and
further
what
particular
procedures
which
we
will
describe
below
are
called
for
to
achieve
compliance
for
the
constitution.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
live
in
school
district
in
a
state
whose
resistance
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
second
to
none.
from
1954
to
1964,
note,
there
was
no
school
desegregation
in
mississippi.
instead,
the
state
has
doctrines
of
interposition
and
nullification.
indeed,
the
university
of
mississippi
desegregated
not
until
more
than
a
decade
after
this
court's
decision
in
sweatt
against
painter.
only
after
what
can
be
called
resistance
with
the
quality
of
rebellion
and
that
of
the
cost
of
life,
not
until
1964
that
the
mississippi
federal
courts
acknowledged
that
children
of
that
state
were
subject
to
the
requirements
of
brown
against
board
of
education.
and
the
first
case
was
evers
against
jackson
municipal
separate
school
district.
shortly
after
the
filing
of
that
case,
medger
evers,
the
plaintiff
was
shot
and
killed.
a
fact
which
bears
upon
respondents
school
districts
continue
to
search
and
that
freedom
of
choice
can
be
a
reality
in
mississippi.
but
the
sorriest
part
of
the
story
lies
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
some
of
united
states
district
judges
in
that
state.
that
discretion
which
in
ordinary
cases
is
necessary
and
salutary
has
been
as
to
the
setting
of
hearings,
the
time
it
takes
to
render
judgments,
the
refusal
to
follow
the
plain
intendment
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
exploitation
of
ambiguity
is
real
ambiguities
and
fancy
ambiguities
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
has
commenced
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
civil
rights
lawyer
or
jess
brown
merely
because
he
filed
the
leake
county
case
which
is
here
as
part
of
these
proceedings
and
sought
to
keep
out
of
state
civil
rights
lawyers
from
handling
cases
in
the
state
only
to
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
all
of
this
has
had
the
effect
of
perpetuating
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
and
so
far
in
mississippi,
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
has
been
racial
segregation
or
minimal
token
desegregation.
indeed
in
these
cases,
the
delay
on
the
district
court
became
so
great
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
to
take
the
unusual
step
in
an
order
of
august
20,
1968
of
setting
a
deadline
for
hearing
the
district
court.
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
had
appealed
from
the
district
court's
refusal
to
set
an
early
hearing
on
motions
following
these
courts
decision
in
green
against
new
kent
county.
the
court
of
appeals
set
november
4,
1968
as
the
deadline
for
hearing
on
plaintiffs'
motions
and
it
directed
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order
granting
relief
within
the
1968-1969
school
year.
the
district
court
did
neither
not
withstanding
the
court
of
appeals
november
4th
deadline,
the
district
court
failed
to
render
an
opinion
for
five
months
and
this
precluded
any
relief
for
the
1968-1969
school
year.
on
may
13,
1969
it
entered
an
order
upholding
the
same
old
freedom
of
choice
plans
on
the
totally
unsupported
assumption
that
freedom
of
choice
might
work
in
the
future.
the
district
court
hearing
astoundingly
enough
consisted
of
more
than
3,000
pages
of
testimony,
most
of
which
was
devoted
to
the
asserted
proposition
that
negro
school
children
are
the
inferiors
of
whites.
the
may
13th
district
court
opinion
reaffirming
the
validity
of
freedom
of
choice
plans
justified
their
failure
to
have
desegregated
because
they
did
not
permit
school
boards
to
cross
the
ties
in
the
negro
community
and
urge
negro
children
to
go
to
white
schools.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
july
3,
1969
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
pardon
me,
that's
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
reason
why
they
said
freedom
of
choice
might
work
in
--
freedom
of
choice
had
failed
to
work
was
because
the
court
of
appeals,
jefferson
orders
said
that
school
districts
could
not
go
out
in
to
the
community
and
urge
children
to
attend
certain
schools.
it
prohibited
them
from
doing
that.
they
said
that
that
was
why
it
didn't
work.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
on
july
3,
1969
announced
the
timetable
which
gives
rise
to
the
instant
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
requested
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
up
desegregation
plans
for
the
respondent
districts
and
present
those
plans
to
the
district
court
by
august
11,
1969
for
hearing
on
august
23.
if
there
were
any
objections
in
the
respondents
schools
districts.
september
1st,
eight
days
later
was
the
deadline
for
implementation
of
the
plans
and
the
court
of
appeals
order
use
the
term
immediately.
accordingly,
a
team
of
27
educators
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
with
distinguished
credentials
that
appear
in
the
record
and
reproduce
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
paid
a
series
of
visits
in
the
school
districts
in
question
produced
detailed
plan.
now
we
have
filed
with
the
court
sets
of
these
plans
here,
sufficient
number
for
each
justice
to
have
a
set
of
plans.
detail
plans
for
the
desegregation
of
the
school
districts
in
question
that
when
inspects
these
plans
and
compares
something
numerous
other
plans
which
have
found
their
way
into
the
courts
and
to
this
court,
one
will
find
that
they
are
as
careful
and
detailed
as
one
might
hope
for.
they
go
in
to
the
mechanics
and
logistics
in
the
number
of
students
and
the
number
of
rooms
and
of
drawing
of
zone
lines.
in
addition
to
which,
they
go
into
something
which
has
been
made
much
of
and
on
and
off
again
in
various
parts
of
the
proceedings
below,
the
whole
question
of
human
relations
and
announcing
the
necessity
of
obedience
of
law
and
setting
up
training
sessions
and
training
teachers
to
work
in
teams
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
on
august
19th
however,
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
judges
withdrawing
these
plans.
the
letter
stated
that
as
the
officer
of
the
united
states
government
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
education
of
pupils
in
this
nation,
he
concluded
the
time
allowed
for
development
of
the
plans
was
too
short.
his
letter
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
on
page
54-a,
there
is
the
pertinent
“as
to
the
reasons
he
gave.”
the
administrative
and
logistical
difficulties
which
must
be
encountered
and
meant
in
the
terribly
short
space
of
time
remaining
will
surely
in
my
judgment
produce
chaos,
confusion,
and
a
catastrophic
educational
setback
to
the
135,700
children.
black
and
white
alike
must
look
to
the
222
schools
of
this
33
mississippi
districts
for
their
only
available
educational
opportunity.
i
might
add
that
while
only
14
cases
are
here.
the
proceedings
below
involved
33
districts
because
on
the
private
plaintiffs
have
taken
this
case
to
this
court
and
the
government
which
is
the
only
plaintiff
and
the
remaining
cases
has
not.
the
secretary's
letter
mentioned
no
particular
fact
concerning
any
particular
district.
in
the
view
of
the
letter,
the
circumstances
of
some
of
the
districts
which
have
only
two
or
three
schools
with
only
a
few
hundred
pupils
were
indistinguishable
from
districts
with
thousands
of
students.
enrollments
in
the
districts
vary
from
720
in
one
district
to
11,000
in
another.
i
calculated
the
median
figure
of
about
27,000
per
school
district.
not
a
single
administrative
or
logistical
fact
was
mentioned
tied
to
any
particular
school
or
tied
to
any
particular
period
of
time,
much
less
described.
no
time
was
prescribed
by
which
the
new
desegregation
plans
were
to
be
complied
with
there
be
gone.
the
letter
was
completely
open-ended
only
proposing
resubmission
of
some
plans
by
december
1st.
having
received
this
letter,
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
district
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
secretary's
request
to
withdraw
plans
which
the
district
court
did
and
the
secretary's
letter
was
followed
by
a
motion
of
the
department
of
justice
i
might
add
to
the
same
effect.
at
the
district
court
hearing
which
to
the
hearing
of
august
25th
that
appears
in
this
particular
court
report
as
transcript,
several
facts
are
clear
appeared
without
any
contradiction.
one
is
that
no
particular
difficulty
administrative
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
any
particular
school
system
was
identified.
the
sort
of
things
was
held
about
these
schools,
could
be
set
about
any
schools
in
any
condition
within
a
process
of
desegregation
or
not.
second,
in
all
likelihood,
it
is
quite
clear,
the
existing
plans
will
be
brought
back
again
with
no
difference
or
with
immaterial
difference
and
in
our
brief
on
page
21,
we
set
forth
some
testimony
that
occurred
in
the
--
this
in
the
brief
not
in
the
petition.
some
testimony
which
occurred
in
the
trial
court
hearing
in
this,
mr.
leonard
interrogated
one
of
the
witnesses
from
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
mr.
jordan.
question:
mr.
jordan,
i
want
to
clarify
to
be
sure
the
court
and
counsel
all
understand
your
position
with
respect
to
the
delay,
should
the
court
grant
a
delay?
am
i
clear
that
it
is
your
position
that
even
with
the
delay
that
in
all
likelihood,
the
plans
would
be
very
much
similar
and
that
these
officials
of
the
school
board
should
start
to
work
with
the
office
of
education
now,
in
fact
by
october
1st
to
prepare
for
the
movement
from
a
dual
to
a
unitary
system,
is
that
your
position?
answer:
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
going
to
be.
and
there,
incidentally
i
might
say
testimony
that
two
witnesses
testified.
one
of
them
inspected
three
school
districts,
he
said
as
to
two
of
the
districts,
the
plans
would
be
identical
as
to
the
third,
he
was
not
aware.
he
did
not
identify
any
particular
change.
third,
the
matter
of
timing
which
is
of
course
one
part
of
the
--
a
crucial
part
of
the
issues
here
had
been
contemplating
in
drawing
the
plans
originally
when
the
court
of
appeals
gave
a
mandate
or
presented
request
to
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
it
requested
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
plans
according
to
a
certain
timetable.
and
that
timetable
was
that
those
plans
might
be
ordered
into
effect
on
august
23rd
and
if
ordered
into
effect
on
august
23rd,
they
were
to
be
plans
which
between
august
23rd
and
september
1st
could
become
operational.
now,
mr.
anre
(ph)
who
was
the
chief
of
all
the
experts
who
examine
the
school
systems
of
considerable
number,
there
might
be
27
i
said.
mr.
anre
wrote
a
letter
which
is
in
the
record
here
in
44-a
of
our
appendix
in
which
he
addresses
himself
not
only
to
the
substance
of
the
plans
but
the
timing
in
the
44-a
of
our
petition
in
a
rather
lengthy
letter
that
discusses
in
considerable
detail,
how
these
plans
were
developed.
he
says,
i
believe
that
each
of
the
enclosed
plans,
educationally
and
administratively
sound
both
in
terms
of
substance
and
in
terms
of
timing.
so,
the
record
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
did
not
express
itself
on
all
aspects
of
that.
i
imagine
that
one
of
the
problems
that
would
have
risen
that
it
did
contemplate
there
would
be
objections
and
the
issue
that
then
would
have
arisen
whether
the
issue
was
to
stay
and
so
forth.
but
it
did
contemplate
that
there
would
be
objections.
if
there
were
no
objections,
the
plans
were
going
to
effect.
if
there
were
objections
they
might
go
into
effect
nevertheless,
it
did
not
discuss
the
timing
of
any
review
that
any
court
he
might
see.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
court
of
appeals
order
did
not
address
itself
to
what
would
happen
between
the
time
of
the
entry
of
an
order
or
putting
plans
into
effect
and
any
review
which
any
party
might
see.
it
did
not
address
itself
to
that.
but
it
addressed
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
plans
is
going
to
effect
on
september
1.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
has
occurred
on
other
occasions
and
in
several
cases
in
this
court
at
this
time.
the
case
that
of
oklahoma
city
in
denver
there
are
plans
in
effect
pending
review.
there
is
the
paragraph
from
page
37-a
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
which
i
think
partly
answers
the
question
explicitly
and
partly
in
the
case
the
court
of
appeals
attitude
to
such
a
proposition.
that
is
what
shall
happen
to
our
own
review.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
read
it.
because
of
the
urgency
of
formulating
and
approving
plans
to
be
implemented
for
the
1969-1970
school
term,
it
is
ordered
as
follows.
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue
immediately
and
will
not
be
stayed
pending
petitions
for
rehearing
a
certiorari,
and
that's
the
mandate
ordering
these
studies
to
be
made
and
the
aspect
of
the
case
we
are
talking
about.
one
might
assume
the
same
attitude
would
carry
over
the
subsequent
court's
proceeding
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
page
37-a,
paragraph
8,
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue

mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
sorry,
of
the
appendix
for
the
petition
for

of
certiorari,
the
printed
document.
the
mandate
of

of
the
urgency
as
reference
heard
to
be
formulating
and
approving
plans
to
be
implemented
for
the
1969-1970
school
term,
it
is
ordered
as
follows.
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue
immediately
and
will
not
be

pending

for

this

will
not
extend
the
time
for
filing

for

or

in
support
of
or
in
opposition
thereto.
any

shall

the

the
court
will
determine
the
time

and

that's
a
repetition.
no
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
fact
of
interrupting
the
school
year
and
the
event
further
relief
is
indicated.
and
i
would
submit
that
indicates
an
attitude
of
urgency
which
make
exceedingly
unlikely
for
the
court
of
appeals
which
stay
any
order
that
might
be
into
desegregating
the
school.
so
it
does
not
address
itself
specifically
to
the
question
that
i
was
asked.
now
the
objections
that
to
implementing
the
plan
which
were
brought
out
in
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
in
the
hearing
of
august
25.
not
link
to
any
district,
not
link
to
any
educational,
administrative
or
logistical
factor.
not
link
to
any
particular
time
for
any
of
the
generalized
objections
do
not
even
begin
to
approach
the
requirements
of
a
showing
prescribed
by
the
second
brown
decision.
much
less,
the
attitude
of
urgency
that's
been
expressed
by
the
court
in
recent
decisions
in
which
as
mr.
justice
black
has
said
in
his
opinion
in
chambers,
the
court
has
expressed
the
view
that
the
time
is
now.
the
district
court
following
the
hearing
recommended
that
the
delay
requested
by
the
secretary
be
granted
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
residing
what
occurred,
what
had
occurred
without
comment
or
explanation,
did
just
that.
petitioners
after
having
asked
mr.
justice
black
to
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
amendment
to
its
earlier
order
brought
the
case
hereon
certiorari
and
this
court
granted
review
according
to
an
accelerated
schedule.
we
submit
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
amended
to
be
vacated
and
urged
that
this
court
do
two
things.
first,
we
submit
that
the
history
of
southern
school
desegregation
in
certain
areas
such
as
these
here
today
calls
for
a
declaration
by
this
court
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
have
their
constitutional
rights
vindicated
now
without
postponement
for
any
reason
or
as
he
put
it
otherwise,
there
are
no
longer
justiciable
issues
in
the
question
of
making
effect
if
not
only
promptly
but
at
ones.
now,
order
sufficient
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
any
pupil
in
the
united
states
who
was
effectively
excluded
from
a
public
school
on
account
of
his
race
or
color.
no
delay
should
be
permitted
for
administrative
or
any
other
reasons.
second,
we
think
this
is
perhaps
more
important
because
we
think
the
court
has
--
well
that
entirely
explicitly
fairly
explicitly
indicated
the
former
that
we
ask
--
the
former
declaration
that
we
ask.
we
ask
for
the
institution
of
procedures
which
will
make
this
declaration
effective.
the
nature
of
the
procedures
we
suggest
derives
from
the
problem
presented
by
maintaining
segregation
as
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
so
long
as
that
is
the
case,
there
is
a
premium
on
litigating
ad
infinitum.
it
used
to
be
a
model
of
segregation
forever
now
it's
become
litigation
forever
making
thousands
of
pages
of
record
on
such
things
as
the
intelligence
of
negro
children,
delaying
the
setting
of
hearings
in
the
entry
of
orders
in
the
effective
dates
of
plans.
we
urge
that
the
plans
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
file
with
this
court.
these
plans
here
be
put
into
effect
immediately.
we
urge
therefore
that
this
court
issue
its
mandate
forthwith
to
the
court
of
appeals
directing
that
it
will
require
the
district
court
to
put
the
hew
plans
on
the
file
in
this
case
into
effect
immediately.
to
that,
there
is
one
exception,
the
plans
is
the
holmes
county
in
meridian
in
these
14
cases
are
written
to
take
effect
in
1970-1971.
h.e.w.
or
some
other
agency
designated
by
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
directed
immediately
to
revise
those
plans
to
take
effect
at
ones
and
not
wait
until
1970-1971.
all
hearing
should
be
held
on
expedited
schedule
to
be
set
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
as
to
what
we
mean
by
immediately.
obviously,
some
time
is
required
to
take
care
of
the
mechanics
of
calling
children
to
classrooms
and
telling
them
of
new
assignments,
of
notifying
bus
drivers
and
so
forth.
the
existing
plans
called
for
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
court
of
--
july
3rd
order
contemplated
a
period
of
eight
days
from
the
hearing
of
august
23
to
implementation
by
september
1st.
the
plans
were
drawn
to
be
implemented
with
in
that
period
of
time
that
would
design
with
that
in
mind.
we
submit
that
no
more
than
that
amount
of
time
is
necessary
and
probably
less.
moreover,
the
schedule
should
be
explicitly
set
forth
in
the
order.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
mid
semester
break.
there
is
no
midyear
break.
there
is
no
midyear
break,
the
year
continues
straight
on
through.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
a
christmas
vacation,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
i'm
not
certain
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
assume
it's
the
typical
christmas
vacation
of
a
week
or
two.
now
i
would
like
point
out
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
made
a
great
deal
of
inquiry
about
that
and
the
uniform
reply
is
no.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
had
some
difficulty
in
formulating
this
portion
of
our
argument.
that
portion
to
which
defines
the
word
immediately
in
terms
of
--
as
we
have
put
it
now,
eight
days
or
less
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
because
we
fear
that
any
expression
by
the
court
authorizing
even
such
a
limited
delay
will
be
exploited
by
the
defendant
school
boards
in
these
cases
and
in
other
cases
as
theoretical
justification
for
further
delay.
a
fixed
time
deadline,
we
finally
conclude
is
vastly
preferable
to
reiteration
of
principles
about
desegregating
and
as
soon
as
possible
which
will
result
in
further
litigation.
i'd
like
to
elaborate
somewhat
on
the
reasons
for
these
two
requests
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
some
cases,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
there
would
be
there,
yes
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
it
would
pose
some
difficulty,
yes.
i
think
the
difficulty
however
would
not
be
great,
it's
not
more
difficult
than
what
occurs
in
some
districts,
i
can
think
of
three
or
four
right
off
hand
would
have
been
teachers
strikes,
would
have
been
a
hurricane
as
it
had
in
mississippi
they
put
their
schools
back
together
pretty
quickly.
they
--
it
would
be
some
difficulty.
we
say
however
that
that
difficulty
is
preferable
to
suffer
than
the
difficulty
of
having
the
constitution
continue
to
go.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
hesitate,
i
have
not
analyzed
the
figures
in
those
terms
however
they
all
are
in
this
book
set
up
in
tabular
form
and
some
instances
more
changes,
some
instances
there
is
less.
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
would
be
substantial
number
of
children
changing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
districts
are
relatively
small
so
the
number
of
teachers
wouldn't
be
very
great
but
in
--
certainly
in
proportion
it
would
be
typically
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
districts.
now
in
effort
to
elaborate
on
why
we
have
asked
for
the
relief
which
we've
requested.
as
to
our
first
request
that
the
rights
be
declared
effective
as
of
now
and
the
purpose
is
not
merely
retorable.
they
are
not
in
particular
satisfaction
that
plaintiffs
or
the
children
in
this
district
whether
their
lawyers
would
take
out
of
the
declaration
by
this
court
saying,
now
this
court
has
indeed
said
virtually
that
as
mr.
justice
black
has
indicated,
there
perhaps
might
be
some
uncertainty
about
it.
so
long
as
there
are
administrative
reasons
for
delay
recognize
certain
consequences
follow.
first,
disruption
and
threats
of
disruption,
threats
of
chaos
and
confusion,
to
borrow
the
language
of
secretary
finch,
are
the
premium.
anyone,
someone
in
official
capacity
or
unofficial
capacity
who
believes
that
his
resistance
will
stimulate
an
administrative
issue
which
will
need
resolution
in
the
courts
has
given
an
incentive
to
make
or
threat
in
trouble.
while
aaron
against
cooper
and
buchanan
versus
warley
in
the
cases
of
this
court
traditionally
have
held
that
resistance
and
violence
are
no
grounds
for
delay.
resistance
and
violence
may
be
translated
into
administrative
problems
and
then
there's
the
question,
is
that
the
kind
of
an
administrative
problem
that
warrants
delay.
we
say
that
kind
of
issue,
that
kind
of
incentive
for
those
who
would
provoke
delay
should
be
removed.
second,
litigation
over
administration
takes
time.
litigants
and
courts
with
the
disposition
to
delay
will
explore
the
issue
of
administration
a
very
great
length
even
when
they
don't
exists
the
administrative
consideration
promoted
by
hostility.
indeed
when
there
are
no
administrative
reasons
at
all.
this
avenue
should
be
foreclosed
as
mr.
justice
black
suggest
by
making
the
right
effective
instantly.
third
and
this
is
less
concrete
but
i
think
more
important.
any
pretense
of
legality
should
strip
from
those
who
are
violating
the
constitution
by
continuing
to
segregate.
they
should
not
be
able
to
parade
respectively
under
the
cloak
of
complying
with
the
so
called
deliberate
speed
doctrine.
it
should
be
indubitably
clear
that
they
are
law
violators
and
i
think
in
this
country,
lawfulness
counts
for
something.
but
the
ingenuity
of
lawyers
and
judges
knows
no
limit
when
the
incentive
is
sufficient.
administration
is
not
the
only
thing
that
can
be
litigated
even
if
the
courts
would
say
the
rights
must
be
realized
now.
some
parties
will
litigate
on
forever
particularly
if
they
are
spending
public
funds,
public
tax
funds
contributed
by
negro
and
white
alike.
in
the
case
at
bar
there
could
have
been
no
credible
reason
to
believe
that
litigation
of
the
intelligence
of
negro
children
could
have
made
the
slightest
difference
in
the
outcome
of
this
lawsuit.
if
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
occupying
large
cardboard
boxes
on
file
on
this
court,
which
has
been
taken
down
on
that
issue.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
after
this
court's
decision
in
green
and
the
unequivocal
declaration
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
cases
or
earlier
face
of
these
cases,
the
freedom
of
choice
plans
could
be
sustained
at
this.
tons
and
tons
of
litigation
on
the
validity
of
freedom
of
choice
and
no
one
could
have
anticipated
that
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
would
have
injected
himself
into
this
case
in
taking
the
position
that
it
took.
the
profit
in
delay
for
those
who
would
maintain
segregation
is
that
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
is
one
of
segregation.
we
propose
that
in
this
case,
this
court
reverse
that
presumption
and
that
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
be
one
of
integration.
in
this
case
fortunately,
that
resolution
is
simple
enough
for
their
exist
plans
more
detailed
than
a
normally
available
in
any
school
desegregation
case.
they've
been
put
together
with
the
considerable
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
rule
does
not
rest
on
the
part
of
country
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
it
exists
in
a
--
come
into
play
in
a
variety
of
circumstances.
the
first
would
be
of
course
where
there
has
been
a
system
of
segregation
maintained
by
law.
we
must
just
establish
it
and
i
think
that's
been
established
in
case
like
carr
and
green
and
the
other
case
before
that.
the
second
is
that
where
the
history
of
the
case
demonstrates
that
protracted
and
interminable
litigation
is
a
means
for
maintaining
racial
segregation
because
it
stays
in
effect
if
litigation
was
on
and
on,
forever
and
forever.
some
sort
of
relief
in
the
nature
of
temporary
relief
must
be
given.
this
is
not
unknown
to
the
law,
that
law
knows
temporary
restraining
orders
and
those
injunctions
pending
appeal.
it
knows
the
use
of
various
writs
to
change
the
status
quo
in
the
situation
when
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
and
the
facts
absolutely
clear.
we
turn
out
to
be
wrong
which
i
would
submit
is
solely
very
doubtful
in
this
case,
we
can
go
back.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
--
if
one
looks
at
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
on
the
implementation
of
the
brown
decision,
one
does
not
try
in
this
degree
of
resistance
all
over
the
country,
one
finds
it
in
several
states,
one
finds
very
considerable
compliance
in
many
places
and
particularly
since
this
court's
decision
in
green
as
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
show,
there
has
been
a
very
mark
increased
in
desegregation
but
not
so
in
districts
such
as
this.
and
that's
why
the
normal
judicial
principles
of
entering
interlocutory
relief
on
a
not
yet
fully
litigated
case
should
come
into
play
here.
we
have
these
plans
here,
they
have
as
much
detail
as
any
plans
implemented
in
any
case
it
had.
we
don't
exist
--
insist
that
they
are
perfect.
i
don't
think
one
could
insist
that
about
plans
which
had
indeed
been
fully
litigated
but
they
are
better
than
what
exists
because
what
exist
is
racial
segregation
contoured
at
the
constitution
of
united
states.
we
urge
this
court
to
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
require
the
district
courts
and
as
to
these
plans
pendente
lite
except
of
the
plans
from
ready
in
its
homes
to
take
effect
now
and
any
further
litigation
including
appeals
should
take
place
with
these
plans
in
effect
not
over
to
--
not
over
a
period
of
years.
this
would
only
place
respondent
districts
at
the
risk
as
in
the
entry
of
any
temporary
restraining
order
that
having
desegregated
later
they
might
prevail
on
the
merits
that
some
court
might
hold
that
segregation
is
permissible
or
that
freedom
of
choice
such
as
they
propose
is
permissible.
we
say
there's
a
very
slight
likelihood
to
the
point
of
insignificance
of
either
of
those
occurring.
to
institute
these
plans
pendente
lite,
places
respondents
in
a
situation
which
will
interrupt
the
school
year
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
in
his
question.
you
know,
we
don't
view
that
lightly
but
school
years
are
interrupted
for
varieties
of
reasons
as
i
stated
in
response
to
his
questions.
the
national
education
association
which
knows
the
thing
or
two
about
education
has
filed
the
brief
as
a
friend
to
the
court
in
this
case
and
said
there
was
no
reason
why
the
desegregation
should
not
occur
immediately
in
the
respondent
school
districts.
and
indeed
there
is
some
considerable
educational
game
to
be
achieved
by
showing
children
that
the
laws
cannot
be
flooded
with
approval.
in
this
case,
i
was
reminded
in
preparing
the
argument
that
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
in
the
case
of
aaron
against
cooper
at
little
rock
school
case.
this
morning
in
the
library
i
went
and
took
a
look
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
indeed
apposite
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
what
i
think
was
one
of
the
great
oral
arguments
in
this
court
which
some
members
of
the
bench
have
heard.
mr.
rankin
said
and
i
think
it
bears
on
the
question
of
the
interruption
of
education.
if
out
of
this
difficulty
and
undesired
situation,
the
people
of
little
rock
and
these
children
who
shouldn't
be
hurt
by
this
problems
learn
the
constitutional
rights
in
this
country
are
precious
that
they
have
a
duty
to
this
negro
boys
and
girls
in
this
community
to
help
them
get
their
constitutional
rights
and
this
constitutional
rights
happens
to
be
the
right
to
enter
a
school.
that
isn't
segregated
but
someday
they
will
want
other
constitutional
rights
and
be
able
to
exercise
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press
and
everything
else
that
we
consider
so
wonderful
in
our
form
of
government
and
you
cant
tear
down
a
part
of
those
rights
without
losing
others
in
the
process
and
there
wasn't
any
part
of
this
country
that
doesn't
have
a
tremendous
state
in
maintaining
each
and
all
of
those
rights
for
all
of
its
people.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
our
view
of
the
government's
position
in
its
brief.
now
the
government's
position
in
this
case
has
changed
considerably
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation.
as
finally
formulated
in
the
brief
which
is
filed
in
this
court,
it
makes
four
main
points.
it
first
says
that
hew
plans
need
not
be
submitted
until
december
1st
because
hew
may
“perhaps
want
to
correct
or
refine
them
on
page
5.”
our
position
is
that's
not
adequate,
we
don't
see
any
reason
in
the
world
to
wait
until
december
1st
that
if
they
know
there
are
any
mistakes
in
those
plans,
that
information
should
have
been
provided
to
the
court
with
the
brief
or
can
be
provided
today.
second,
they
say
formulation
of
a
workable
plan
followed
by
its
implementation
necessarily
requires
several
weeks
of
informed
effort
and
we
say
there
has
been
plenty
of
time.
that
we
think
that
the
people
who
drew
up
the
hew
plans
if
you
look
at
them
were
aware
of
these
needs
and
their
belief
was
that
the
need
for
human
relations
work
and
informing
people
about
how
to
work
together
in
the
desirability
of
following
the
constitution
could
be
done
simultaneously
and
best
in
the
context
of
actually
following
it.
they
say
that
implementation
may
be
had
for
example
a
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
my
understanding
is
there
is
no
mid-semester.
so
far
as
christmas
recess
is
concerned,
i
don't
see
why
that's
anymore
desirable
than
thanksgiving
recess
which
is
sooner
or
indeed
if
the
mandate
of
the
mechanical
work
and
the
court's
deliberations
can
be
completed
before
that
in
advance
that
no
reason
why
we
should
wait
this
long.
finally
and
this
is
the
part
of
their
position
that
we
find
most
distressing.
the
school
board
should
bear
the
burden
of
justifying
below
in
the
context
of
an
appropriately
expedited
appellate
review
schedule,
any
delay
beyond
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
this
to
me
is
an
indication
once
more
to
more
litigation
forever.
no
one
doubts
that
the
school
boards
in
these
cases
in
any
event,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
school
boards
are
not
doing
this.
we're
obeying
the
law
and
we're
having
substantial
amount
of
change
now
particularly
since
the
green
decision
but
no
one
doubts
of
these
school
boards
given
their
history
our
going
to
litigate
whatever
order
comes
out
of
here,
no
one
doubt
that
this
district
court
is
going
to
rule
with
them
and
they
were
going
to
be
in
the
merry-go-round
again,
going
up
and
around
and
around
again.
we
submit
that
in
these
cases,
we
have
plans,
those
plans
should
be
put
into
effect
that
those
plans
shall
be
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
and
then
they
want
to
litigate
forever,
they
can
do
it.
i
doubt
that
there
will
be
the
inventive.
mr.
satterfield's
position
i
think,
a
position
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
brief
which
i
have
submitted
indicated
as
their
disposition.
they
claim
that
mississippi
is
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
that
nothing
further
need
be
done
that
the
rule
of
law
is
being
obeyed.
i
think
i
need
make
no
comment
on
that.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
haven't
calculated
but
there
--
well,
no
because
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
that
he
says
that
we
can
keep
on
litigating
--
he
is
willing
to
have
us
litigate
forever
during
the
--
well
status
quo
segregation
is
maintained.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
doesn't
agree
with
our
position
on
pendente
lite
i
gather
and
the
states
various
objections
to
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
the
other
hand,
page
7,
since
we
agree
that
the
school
board's
obligation
to
desegregate
the
school
systems
is
a
median
unqualified.
we
believe
the
court
below
may
properly
be
authorized
to
acquire
the
implementation
of
the
plans
commencing
at
the
most
practical
eminent
juncture
in
the
school
year
as
for
example
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
moreover,
the
school
board
should
bear
the
burden
of
justifying
below
in
the
context
of
an
appropriately
expedited
appellate
review
schedule
any
delay
beyond
this
points
but
we've
had
expedited
appellate
review
schedules
here.
and
those
expedited
appellate
review
schedules
have
brought
us
here.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
had
not
read
that
way,
i
would
be
quite
please
if
the
department
of
justice
would
take
position
that
we
should
have
a
condition
of
desegregation
pendente
lite
but
nevertheless
we
do
disagree
on
the
timing.
i
see
no
point
and
waiting
for
thanksgiving,
certainly
not
for
christmas,
certainly
the
judicial
work
must
be
done
and
no
one
can
say
how
long
it
will
take
the
court
to
deliberate
and
come
to
a
conclusion.
but
if
the
court
should
come
to
a
conclusion
substantially
in
advance
of
that,
then
we
say
the
mandate
should
go
down
forthwith
and
those
rights
should
not
be
denied
one
moment
longer.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
suggest
an
order
that
the
plans
for
all
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
a
concrete
order,
the
order
should
mr.
justice
black
that
for
all
districts
in
this
litigation
with
the
exception
of
meridian
and
holmes,
the
plan
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
because
there
is
some
slight
revision
in
those
plans
necessary
which
i
think
would
take
a
matter
of
several
days
to
work
out
but
in
all
districts
except
those
plans,
except
those
two
districts.
these
plans
in
this
book
which
had
prepared
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
should
go
into
effect
instantaneously
taking
only
so
much
time
as
is
necessary
to
complete
the
mechanics
of
informing
the
parents
and
the
children
and
the
bus
drivers
and
the
teachers
and
in
any
event
no
more
than
eight
days
because
those
plans
were
drawn
up
to
be
implemented.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
i
have
a
--
that's
not
entirely
arbitrary
period
of
time.
that
period
of
time
is
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
directed
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
a
plan
for
--
within
which
they
could
be
implemented.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
department
contemplated
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
certain
building
plans
were
in
process.
they
would
wait
for
those
plans
to
be
completed
and
consequently
desegregation
would
be
completed
there
in
the
1970-1971
school
year
instead
of
1969-1970.
while
we
would
certainly
conceive
that
there
might
be
a
much
more
desirable
situation
which
new
buildings
and
as
in
1970-1971,
we
say
they
should
do
the
best
they
can
with
the
existing
buildings
in
1969-1970
and
that
all
the
children,
black
and
white
alike
share
such
buildings
as
they
have
as
at
the
present
time
1970-1971
when
they
have
more
buildings,
they
can
then
redistribute
them
again.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
or
some
other
agency
selected
by
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
given
the
directions
within
a
brief
time
certain
to
make
the
necessary
revisions
and
those
plans
to
put
them
into
effect
right
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think
that
this
court
can
appraise
and
evaluate
the
quality
of
the
plans
on
the
record
that
has
been
made
about
them
without
reading
the
plans
themselves.
i
confess
i
have
subjected
myself
to
that
and
they
seem
like
any
other
plans.
and
they
certainly
come
with
better
credentials
than
any
other
plans
that
i
have
said.
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
enter
an
order
forthwith
directing
the
court
of
appeals
to
see
that
these
are
implemented,
i
don't
suggest
this
court
get
involved
in
the
details
of
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
not
as
that
the
--
we
--
there
was
no
opportunity
to
and
just
a
4333
to
this
litigation,
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
been
disposed
to
either
except
for
the
1970-1971
plans.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
except
that
within
that,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
moments
of
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
satterfield
has
made
regular
references
to
the
absence
of
a
record
in
this
court
and
i
think
that's
very
illuminating
because
i
might
say
at
the
outset
there
is
indeed
the
complete
record
in
this
court
and
it
has
been
here
for
some
considerable
period
of
time.
it's
in
mr.
davis'
office
right
behind
the
court.
it's
not
before
the
court
but
it's
behind
the
court.
the
problem
--
there
was
problem
however
in
obtaining
this
record
and
it
teaches
us
something
about
this
litigation.
when
we
file
this
case
here,
we
ask
the
clerk
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
send
up
the
record.
he
sent
up
everything
that
he
had.
however,
part
of
the
record
was
in
judge
cox's
court.
we
request
that
judge
cox's
clerk
to
send
the
record
up
and
he
refused.
we
sent
a
lawyer
to
visit
the
clerk
and
the
clerk
said
that
he
wanted
50
cents
a
page
for
the
record
and
we
said
we
didn't
want
it
and
we
could
not
pay
all
that
money
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
record.
and
the
lawyer
went
and
visited
judge
cox
and
judge
cox
said,
he
would
not
send
the
record
up
and
indeed,
he
thought
the
price
have
gone
up.[laughter]
but
we
then
communicated
with
mr.
davis
of
this
court
through
processes
of
communication
with
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
was
able
to
obtain
the
record
and
it
sits
in
there
in
eight
huge
boxes
for
anyone
who
cares
to
read
it.
that
is
the
story
of
the
litigation
in
this
case.
judge
cox
doesn't
let
you
have
the
record
and
mr.
satterfield
says,
you
don't
belong
in
this
court
because
you
don't
have
it.
the
fact
is
however,
we
do
have
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
reference
to
further
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
about
whether
the
rule
we
propose
here
is
for
only
one
part
of
the
country.
the
pendente
lite
rule
which
is
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
had
reference
to
is
particularly
appropriate
in
these
cases
because
here
we
have
substantially
or
fully
matured
plans
which
are
capable
of
being
put
into
effect
and
perhaps
completely
or
certainly
almost
close
to
completely
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
this
court's
decision
in
brown
as
elucidated
in
many
later
decisions.
i
think
that's
what
peculiarly
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
particular
case
and
it's
not
a
sectional
suggestion
but
one
that
adverts
to
the
circumstances
here.
now,
this
country
has
made
the
men
strides
in
eradicating
the
stigma
of
slavery
since
and
largely
as
result
to
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education.
the
principle
of
those
cases
has
been
important
not
only
in
theory
but
because
of
actual
implementation
which
shows
that
this
court
and
this
nation
stands
behind
the
theory.
conversely,
a
retreat
from
the
principles
of
brown
as
well
as
what
that
retreat
would
symbolize
will
tell
the
country
more
than
many
volumes
of
mere
rhetoric
about
what
the
country
stands.
plessy
against
ferguson
symbolized
the
retreat
from
the
principles
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
was
followed
by
not
even
a
separate
but
equal
doctrine
which
it
professed.
it
is
crucial,
we
submit,
that
if
we
are
to
continue
in
the
path
of
bringing
the
black
and
the
white
citizens
of
this
country
together.
of
course,
which
was
resumed
by
the
brown
decision
after
more
than
half
a
century
following
plessy
versus
ferguson
that
this
court
may
clear
in
this
case,
in
which
the
real
issue
is
whether
we
shall
continue
to
go
forward
or
halt
that
the
rights
of
the
constitution
are
for
the
here
and
now
and
not
merely
stuff
about
which
lawyers
play
charades.
but
there
is
more
in
this
case
than
the
relations
of
america's
black
to
white
citizens
crucial
as
that
is.
in
one
of
his
great
opinions
for
almost
a
quarter
of
century
ago,
mr.
justice
rutledge
voiced
in
dissent
an
admonition
that
has
special
application
today.
he
said,
“it
is
not
too
early,
it
is
never
too
early
for
the
nation
steadfastly
to
follow
its
great
constitutional
traditions.
it
can
become
too
late.”
every
one
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
schoolchildren,
black
and
white
in
the
14
school
districts
encompass
by
this
litigation
entered
the
public
schools
of
mississippi
years
after
the
day,
may
17,
1954
when
this
court
announced
that
segregation
and
the
constitution
cannot
co-exist.
yet
no
more
than
a
handful
of
these
children,
has
attended
a
lawfully
constituted
school.
thus
far
then,
out
of
their
life
experience,
the
black
and
white
schoolchildren
in
these
14
school
districts
have
not
learned
that
the
constitution
is
to
be
protected
and
defended,
cherished
and
lived.
today,
we
ask
this
court
to
direct
the
entry
of
decrees
ordering
desegregation
now.
with
the
constitution
to
be
the
rule
of
decision
pendente
lite,
we
asked
this
not
merely
because
another
forth
night
of
a
dual
schools
system
is
intolerable.
but
rather
because
another
forth
night
upon
warranted
displacement
of
the
constitution
is
intolerable.
the
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
children
in
these
school
districts
and
indeed
the
children
in
every
school
district
throughout
our
beloved
land
are
at
last
to
learn
that
there
was
supreme
law
of
the
land
binding
upon
children
or
parents,
binding
upon
school
boards,
binding
upon
the
states,
binding
upon
the
united
states
and
binding
upon
and
enforced
by
this
high
federal
law.
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
in
this
concurring
opinion
in
sweezy
against
new
hampshire,
“but
in
the
end,
judgment
cannot
be
escaped,
the
judgment
of
this
court.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
involved
the
issue
of
the
timing
of
desegregation
of
14
mississippi
school
districts
and
the
procedure
by
which
is
to
be
accomplished.
the
basic
issue
here
is
how
much
longer
negro
school
children
in
these
cases
in
14
mississippi
school
districts
must
wait
to
realize
their
constitutional
right
to
attend
desegregated
school
systems
required
by
this
court
more
than
15
years
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
basic
issue
here
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
is
how
much
longer
negro
school
children
in
these
districts
must
wait
to
realize
their
constitutional
right
to
attend
desegregated
schools
decreed
by
this
court
more
than
15
years
ago.
the
law
has
been
disobeyed
by
respondent
districts
and
the
courts
below
have
not
required
obedience.
we
submit
that
the
issues
must
be
seen
in
historical
context.
for
only
in
that
context
is
it
apparent
why
as
we
urge
that
this
court's
expression
on
timing
must
be
unequivocal
and
further
what
particular
procedures
which
we
will
describe
below
are
called
for
to
achieve
compliance
for
the
constitution.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
live
in
school
district
in
a
state
whose
resistance
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
second
to
none.
from
1954
to
1964,
note,
there
was
no
school
desegregation
in
mississippi.
instead,
the
state
has
doctrines
of
interposition
and
nullification.
indeed,
the
university
of
mississippi
desegregated
not
until
more
than
a
decade
after
this
court's
decision
in
sweatt
against
painter.
only
after
what
can
be
called
resistance
with
the
quality
of
rebellion
and
that
of
the
cost
of
life,
not
until
1964
that
the
mississippi
federal
courts
acknowledged
that
children
of
that
state
were
subject
to
the
requirements
of
brown
against
board
of
education.
and
the
first
case
was
evers
against
jackson
municipal
separate
school
district.
shortly
after
the
filing
of
that
case,
medger
evers,
the
plaintiff
was
shot
and
killed.
a
fact
which
bears
upon
respondents
school
districts
continue
to
search
and
that
freedom
of
choice
can
be
a
reality
in
mississippi.
but
the
sorriest
part
of
the
story
lies
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
some
of
united
states
district
judges
in
that
state.
that
discretion
which
in
ordinary
cases
is
necessary
and
salutary
has
been
as
to
the
setting
of
hearings,
the
time
it
takes
to
render
judgments,
the
refusal
to
follow
the
plain
intendment
of
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
exploitation
of
ambiguity
is
real
ambiguities
and
fancy
ambiguities
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
has
commenced
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
civil
rights
lawyer
or
jess
brown
merely
because
he
filed
the
leake
county
case
which
is
here
as
part
of
these
proceedings
and
sought
to
keep
out
of
state
civil
rights
lawyers
from
handling
cases
in
the
state
only
to
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
all
of
this
has
had
the
effect
of
perpetuating
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
and
so
far
in
mississippi,
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
has
been
racial
segregation
or
minimal
token
desegregation.
indeed
in
these
cases,
the
delay
on
the
district
court
became
so
great
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
to
take
the
unusual
step
in
an
order
of
august
20,
1968
of
setting
a
deadline
for
hearing
the
district
court.
plaintiffs
in
the
united
states
had
appealed
from
the
district
court's
refusal
to
set
an
early
hearing
on
motions
following
these
courts
decision
in
green
against
new
kent
county.
the
court
of
appeals
set
november
4,
1968
as
the
deadline
for
hearing
on
plaintiffs'
motions
and
it
directed
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order
granting
relief
within
the
1968-1969
school
year.
the
district
court
did
neither
not
withstanding
the
court
of
appeals
november
4th
deadline,
the
district
court
failed
to
render
an
opinion
for
five
months
and
this
precluded
any
relief
for
the
1968-1969
school
year.
on
may
13,
1969
it
entered
an
order
upholding
the
same
old
freedom
of
choice
plans
on
the
totally
unsupported
assumption
that
freedom
of
choice
might
work
in
the
future.
the
district
court
hearing
astoundingly
enough
consisted
of
more
than
3,000
pages
of
testimony,
most
of
which
was
devoted
to
the
asserted
proposition
that
negro
school
children
are
the
inferiors
of
whites.
the
may
13th
district
court
opinion
reaffirming
the
validity
of
freedom
of
choice
plans
justified
their
failure
to
have
desegregated
because
they
did
not
permit
school
boards
to
cross
the
ties
in
the
negro
community
and
urge
negro
children
to
go
to
white
schools.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
july
3,
1969
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
pardon
me,
that's
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
reason
why
they
said
freedom
of
choice
might
work
in
--
freedom
of
choice
had
failed
to
work
was
because
the
court
of
appeals,
jefferson
orders
said
that
school
districts
could
not
go
out
in
to
the
community
and
urge
children
to
attend
certain
schools.
it
prohibited
them
from
doing
that.
they
said
that
that
was
why
it
didn't
work.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
on
july
3,
1969
announced
the
timetable
which
gives
rise
to
the
instant
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
requested
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
up
desegregation
plans
for
the
respondent
districts
and
present
those
plans
to
the
district
court
by
august
11,
1969
for
hearing
on
august
23.
if
there
were
any
objections
in
the
respondents
schools
districts.
september
1st,
eight
days
later
was
the
deadline
for
implementation
of
the
plans
and
the
court
of
appeals
order
use
the
term
immediately.
accordingly,
a
team
of
27
educators
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
with
distinguished
credentials
that
appear
in
the
record
and
reproduce
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
paid
a
series
of
visits
in
the
school
districts
in
question
produced
detailed
plan.
now
we
have
filed
with
the
court
sets
of
these
plans
here,
sufficient
number
for
each
justice
to
have
a
set
of
plans.
detail
plans
for
the
desegregation
of
the
school
districts
in
question
that
when
inspects
these
plans
and
compares
something
numerous
other
plans
which
have
found
their
way
into
the
courts
and
to
this
court,
one
will
find
that
they
are
as
careful
and
detailed
as
one
might
hope
for.
they
go
in
to
the
mechanics
and
logistics
in
the
number
of
students
and
the
number
of
rooms
and
of
drawing
of
zone
lines.
in
addition
to
which,
they
go
into
something
which
has
been
made
much
of
and
on
and
off
again
in
various
parts
of
the
proceedings
below,
the
whole
question
of
human
relations
and
announcing
the
necessity
of
obedience
of
law
and
setting
up
training
sessions
and
training
teachers
to
work
in
teams
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
on
august
19th
however,
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
judges
withdrawing
these
plans.
the
letter
stated
that
as
the
officer
of
the
united
states
government
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
education
of
pupils
in
this
nation,
he
concluded
the
time
allowed
for
development
of
the
plans
was
too
short.
his
letter
appears
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
on
page
54-a,
there
is
the
pertinent
“as
to
the
reasons
he
gave.”
the
administrative
and
logistical
difficulties
which
must
be
encountered
and
meant
in
the
terribly
short
space
of
time
remaining
will
surely
in
my
judgment
produce
chaos,
confusion,
and
a
catastrophic
educational
setback
to
the
135,700
children.
black
and
white
alike
must
look
to
the
222
schools
of
this
33
mississippi
districts
for
their
only
available
educational
opportunity.
i
might
add
that
while
only
14
cases
are
here.
the
proceedings
below
involved
33
districts
because
on
the
private
plaintiffs
have
taken
this
case
to
this
court
and
the
government
which
is
the
only
plaintiff
and
the
remaining
cases
has
not.
the
secretary's
letter
mentioned
no
particular
fact
concerning
any
particular
district.
in
the
view
of
the
letter,
the
circumstances
of
some
of
the
districts
which
have
only
two
or
three
schools
with
only
a
few
hundred
pupils
were
indistinguishable
from
districts
with
thousands
of
students.
enrollments
in
the
districts
vary
from
720
in
one
district
to
11,000
in
another.
i
calculated
the
median
figure
of
about
27,000
per
school
district.
not
a
single
administrative
or
logistical
fact
was
mentioned
tied
to
any
particular
school
or
tied
to
any
particular
period
of
time,
much
less
described.
no
time
was
prescribed
by
which
the
new
desegregation
plans
were
to
be
complied
with
there
be
gone.
the
letter
was
completely
open-ended
only
proposing
resubmission
of
some
plans
by
december
1st.
having
received
this
letter,
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
district
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
secretary's
request
to
withdraw
plans
which
the
district
court
did
and
the
secretary's
letter
was
followed
by
a
motion
of
the
department
of
justice
i
might
add
to
the
same
effect.
at
the
district
court
hearing
which
to
the
hearing
of
august
25th
that
appears
in
this
particular
court
report
as
transcript,
several
facts
are
clear
appeared
without
any
contradiction.
one
is
that
no
particular
difficulty
administrative
or
otherwise
with
respect
to
any
particular
school
system
was
identified.
the
sort
of
things
was
held
about
these
schools,
could
be
set
about
any
schools
in
any
condition
within
a
process
of
desegregation
or
not.
second,
in
all
likelihood,
it
is
quite
clear,
the
existing
plans
will
be
brought
back
again
with
no
difference
or
with
immaterial
difference
and
in
our
brief
on
page
21,
we
set
forth
some
testimony
that
occurred
in
the
--
this
in
the
brief
not
in
the
petition.
some
testimony
which
occurred
in
the
trial
court
hearing
in
this,
mr.
leonard
interrogated
one
of
the
witnesses
from
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
mr.
jordan.
question:
mr.
jordan,
i
want
to
clarify
to
be
sure
the
court
and
counsel
all
understand
your
position
with
respect
to
the
delay,
should
the
court
grant
a
delay?
am
i
clear
that
it
is
your
position
that
even
with
the
delay
that
in
all
likelihood,
the
plans
would
be
very
much
similar
and
that
these
officials
of
the
school
board
should
start
to
work
with
the
office
of
education
now,
in
fact
by
october
1st
to
prepare
for
the
movement
from
a
dual
to
a
unitary
system,
is
that
your
position?
answer:
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
going
to
be.
and
there,
incidentally
i
might
say
testimony
that
two
witnesses
testified.
one
of
them
inspected
three
school
districts,
he
said
as
to
two
of
the
districts,
the
plans
would
be
identical
as
to
the
third,
he
was
not
aware.
he
did
not
identify
any
particular
change.
third,
the
matter
of
timing
which
is
of
course
one
part
of
the
--
a
crucial
part
of
the
issues
here
had
been
contemplating
in
drawing
the
plans
originally
when
the
court
of
appeals
gave
a
mandate
or
presented
request
to
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
it
requested
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
plans
according
to
a
certain
timetable.
and
that
timetable
was
that
those
plans
might
be
ordered
into
effect
on
august
23rd
and
if
ordered
into
effect
on
august
23rd,
they
were
to
be
plans
which
between
august
23rd
and
september
1st
could
become
operational.
now,
mr.
anre
(ph)
who
was
the
chief
of
all
the
experts
who
examine
the
school
systems
of
considerable
number,
there
might
be
27
i
said.
mr.
anre
wrote
a
letter
which
is
in
the
record
here
in
44-a
of
our
appendix
in
which
he
addresses
himself
not
only
to
the
substance
of
the
plans
but
the
timing
in
the
44-a
of
our
petition
in
a
rather
lengthy
letter
that
discusses
in
considerable
detail,
how
these
plans
were
developed.
he
says,
i
believe
that
each
of
the
enclosed
plans,
educationally
and
administratively
sound
both
in
terms
of
substance
and
in
terms
of
timing.
so,
the
record
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
did
not
express
itself
on
all
aspects
of
that.
i
imagine
that
one
of
the
problems
that
would
have
risen
that
it
did
contemplate
there
would
be
objections
and
the
issue
that
then
would
have
arisen
whether
the
issue
was
to
stay
and
so
forth.
but
it
did
contemplate
that
there
would
be
objections.
if
there
were
no
objections,
the
plans
were
going
to
effect.
if
there
were
objections
they
might
go
into
effect
nevertheless,
it
did
not
discuss
the
timing
of
any
review
that
any
court
he
might
see.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
court
of
appeals
order
did
not
address
itself
to
what
would
happen
between
the
time
of
the
entry
of
an
order
or
putting
plans
into
effect
and
any
review
which
any
party
might
see.
it
did
not
address
itself
to
that.
but
it
addressed
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
plans
is
going
to
effect
on
september
1.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
has
occurred
on
other
occasions
and
in
several
cases
in
this
court
at
this
time.
the
case
that
of
oklahoma
city
in
denver
there
are
plans
in
effect
pending
review.
there
is
the
paragraph
from
page
37-a
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
which
i
think
partly
answers
the
question
explicitly
and
partly
in
the
case
the
court
of
appeals
attitude
to
such
a
proposition.
that
is
what
shall
happen
to
our
own
review.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
read
it.
because
of
the
urgency
of
formulating
and
approving
plans
to
be
implemented
for
the
1969-1970
school
term,
it
is
ordered
as
follows.
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue
immediately
and
will
not
be
stayed
pending
petitions
for
rehearing
a
certiorari,
and
that's
the
mandate
ordering
these
studies
to
be
made
and
the
aspect
of
the
case
we
are
talking
about.
one
might
assume
the
same
attitude
would
carry
over
the
subsequent
court's
proceeding
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
page
37-a,
paragraph
8,
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
sorry,
of
the
appendix
for
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
printed
document.
the
mandate
of
--
because
of
the
urgency
as
reference
heard
to
be
formulating
and
approving
plans
to
be
implemented
for
the
1969-1970
school
term,
it
is
ordered
as
follows.
the
mandate
of
this
court
shall
issue
immediately
and
will
not
be
stayed
pending
motions
for
rehearing
of
certiorari.
this
court
will
not
extend
the
time
for
filing
petitions
for
rehearing
or
briefs
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
thereto.
any
appeals
from
orders
or
decrees
of
the
district
court
on
remand
shall
be
expedited.
the
record
on
any
appeal
shall
be
largely
this
court
and
appellant's
brief
filed
all
within
10
days
of
the
date
of
the
order
or
the
decree
of
the
district
court
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken.
appellees'
brief
shall
be
due
ten
days
thereafter.
the
court
will
determine
the
time
and
place
for
oral
argument
if
allowed.
the
court
will
determine
the
time
for
briefing
and
for
oral
argument
if
allowed.
that's
a
repetition.
no
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
fact
of
interrupting
the
school
year
and
the
event
further
relief
is
indicated.
and
i
would
submit
that
indicates
an
attitude
of
urgency
which
make
exceedingly
unlikely
for
the
court
of
appeals
which
stay
any
order
that
might
be
into
desegregating
the
school.
so
it
does
not
address
itself
specifically
to
the
question
that
i
was
asked.
now
the
objections
that
to
implementing
the
plan
which
were
brought
out
in
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
in
the
hearing
of
august
25.
not
link
to
any
district,
not
link
to
any
educational,
administrative
or
logistical
factor.
not
link
to
any
particular
time
for
any
of
the
generalized
objections
do
not
even
begin
to
approach
the
requirements
of
a
showing
prescribed
by
the
second
brown
decision.
much
less,
the
attitude
of
urgency
that's
been
expressed
by
the
court
in
recent
decisions
in
which
as
mr.
justice
black
has
said
in
his
opinion
in
chambers,
the
court
has
expressed
the
view
that
the
time
is
now.
the
district
court
following
the
hearing
recommended
that
the
delay
requested
by
the
secretary
be
granted
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
residing
what
occurred,
what
had
occurred
without
comment
or
explanation,
did
just
that.
petitioners
after
having
asked
mr.
justice
black
to
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
amendment
to
its
earlier
order
brought
the
case
hereon
certiorari
and
this
court
granted
review
according
to
an
accelerated
schedule.
we
submit
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
amended
to
be
vacated
and
urged
that
this
court
do
two
things.
first,
we
submit
that
the
history
of
southern
school
desegregation
in
certain
areas
such
as
these
here
today
calls
for
a
declaration
by
this
court
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
have
their
constitutional
rights
vindicated
now
without
postponement
for
any
reason
or
as
he
put
it
otherwise,
there
are
no
longer
justiciable
issues
in
the
question
of
making
effect
if
not
only
promptly
but
at
ones.
now,
order
sufficient
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
any
pupil
in
the
united
states
who
was
effectively
excluded
from
a
public
school
on
account
of
his
race
or
color.
no
delay
should
be
permitted
for
administrative
or
any
other
reasons.
second,
we
think
this
is
perhaps
more
important
because
we
think
the
court
has
--
well
that
entirely
explicitly
fairly
explicitly
indicated
the
former
that
we
ask
--
the
former
declaration
that
we
ask.
we
ask
for
the
institution
of
procedures
which
will
make
this
declaration
effective.
the
nature
of
the
procedures
we
suggest
derives
from
the
problem
presented
by
maintaining
segregation
as
the
status
quo
pendente
lite.
so
long
as
that
is
the
case,
there
is
a
premium
on
litigating
ad
infinitum.
it
used
to
be
a
model
of
segregation
forever
now
it's
become
litigation
forever
making
thousands
of
pages
of
record
on
such
things
as
the
intelligence
of
negro
children,
delaying
the
setting
of
hearings
in
the
entry
of
orders
in
the
effective
dates
of
plans.
we
urge
that
the
plans
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
file
with
this
court.
these
plans
here
be
put
into
effect
immediately.
we
urge
therefore
that
this
court
issue
its
mandate
forthwith
to
the
court
of
appeals
directing
that
it
will
require
the
district
court
to
put
the
hew
plans
on
the
file
in
this
case
into
effect
immediately.
to
that,
there
is
one
exception,
the
plans
is
the
holmes
county
in
meridian
in
these
14
cases
are
written
to
take
effect
in
1970-1971.
h.e.w.
or
some
other
agency
designated
by
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
directed
immediately
to
revise
those
plans
to
take
effect
at
ones
and
not
wait
until
1970-1971.
all
hearing
should
be
held
on
expedited
schedule
to
be
set
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
as
to
what
we
mean
by
immediately.
obviously,
some
time
is
required
to
take
care
of
the
mechanics
of
calling
children
to
classrooms
and
telling
them
of
new
assignments,
of
notifying
bus
drivers
and
so
forth.
the
existing
plans
called
for
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
court
of
--
july
3rd
order
contemplated
a
period
of
eight
days
from
the
hearing
of
august
23
to
implementation
by
september
1st.
the
plans
were
drawn
to
be
implemented
with
in
that
period
of
time
that
would
design
with
that
in
mind.
we
submit
that
no
more
than
that
amount
of
time
is
necessary
and
probably
less.
moreover,
the
schedule
should
be
explicitly
set
forth
in
the
order.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
mid
semester
break.
there
is
no
midyear
break.
there
is
no
midyear
break,
the
year
continues
straight
on
through.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
a
christmas
vacation,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
i'm
not
certain
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
assume
it's
the
typical
christmas
vacation
of
a
week
or
two.
now
i
would
like
point
out
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
made
a
great
deal
of
inquiry
about
that
and
the
uniform
reply
is
no.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
had
some
difficulty
in
formulating
this
portion
of
our
argument.
that
portion
to
which
defines
the
word
immediately
in
terms
of
--
as
we
have
put
it
now,
eight
days
or
less
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
because
we
fear
that
any
expression
by
the
court
authorizing
even
such
a
limited
delay
will
be
exploited
by
the
defendant
school
boards
in
these
cases
and
in
other
cases
as
theoretical
justification
for
further
delay.
a
fixed
time
deadline,
we
finally
conclude
is
vastly
preferable
to
reiteration
of
principles
about
desegregating
and
as
soon
as
possible
which
will
result
in
further
litigation.
i'd
like
to
elaborate
somewhat
on
the
reasons
for
these
two
requests
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
some
cases,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
there
would
be
there,
yes
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
it
would
pose
some
difficulty,
yes.
i
think
the
difficulty
however
would
not
be
great,
it's
not
more
difficult
than
what
occurs
in
some
districts,
i
can
think
of
three
or
four
right
off
hand
would
have
been
teachers
strikes,
would
have
been
a
hurricane
as
it
had
in
mississippi
they
put
their
schools
back
together
pretty
quickly.
they
--
it
would
be
some
difficulty.
we
say
however
that
that
difficulty
is
preferable
to
suffer
than
the
difficulty
of
having
the
constitution
continue
to
go.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
hesitate,
i
have
not
analyzed
the
figures
in
those
terms
however
they
all
are
in
this
book
set
up
in
tabular
form
and
some
instances
more
changes,
some
instances
there
is
less.
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
would
be
substantial
number
of
children
changing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
districts
are
relatively
small
so
the
number
of
teachers
wouldn't
be
very
great
but
in
--
certainly
in
proportion
it
would
be
typically
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
districts.
now
in
effort
to
elaborate
on
why
we
have
asked
for
the
relief
which
we've
requested.
as
to
our
first
request
that
the
rights
be
declared
effective
as
of
now
and
the
purpose
is
not
merely
retorable.
they
are
not
in
particular
satisfaction
that
plaintiffs
or
the
children
in
this
district
whether
their
lawyers
would
take
out
of
the
declaration
by
this
court
saying,
now
this
court
has
indeed
said
virtually
that
as
mr.
justice
black
has
indicated,
there
perhaps
might
be
some
uncertainty
about
it.
so
long
as
there
are
administrative
reasons
for
delay
recognize
certain
consequences
follow.
first,
disruption
and
threats
of
disruption,
threats
of
chaos
and
confusion,
to
borrow
the
language
of
secretary
finch,
are
the
premium.
anyone,
someone
in
official
capacity
or
unofficial
capacity
who
believes
that
his
resistance
will
stimulate
an
administrative
issue
which
will
need
resolution
in
the
courts
has
given
an
incentive
to
make
or
threat
in
trouble.
while
aaron
against
cooper
and
buchanan
versus
warley
in
the
cases
of
this
court
traditionally
have
held
that
resistance
and
violence
are
no
grounds
for
delay.
resistance
and
violence
may
be
translated
into
administrative
problems
and
then
there's
the
question,
is
that
the
kind
of
an
administrative
problem
that
warrants
delay.
we
say
that
kind
of
issue,
that
kind
of
incentive
for
those
who
would
provoke
delay
should
be
removed.
second,
litigation
over
administration
takes
time.
litigants
and
courts
with
the
disposition
to
delay
will
explore
the
issue
of
administration
a
very
great
length
even
when
they
don't
exists
the
administrative
consideration
promoted
by
hostility.
indeed
when
there
are
no
administrative
reasons
at
all.
this
avenue
should
be
foreclosed
as
mr.
justice
black
suggest
by
making
the
right
effective
instantly.
third
and
this
is
less
concrete
but
i
think
more
important.
any
pretense
of
legality
should
strip
from
those
who
are
violating
the
constitution
by
continuing
to
segregate.
they
should
not
be
able
to
parade
respectively
under
the
cloak
of
complying
with
the
so
called
deliberate
speed
doctrine.
it
should
be
indubitably
clear
that
they
are
law
violators
and
i
think
in
this
country,
lawfulness
counts
for
something.
but
the
ingenuity
of
lawyers
and
judges
knows
no
limit
when
the
incentive
is
sufficient.
administration
is
not
the
only
thing
that
can
be
litigated
even
if
the
courts
would
say
the
rights
must
be
realized
now.
some
parties
will
litigate
on
forever
particularly
if
they
are
spending
public
funds,
public
tax
funds
contributed
by
negro
and
white
alike.
in
the
case
at
bar
there
could
have
been
no
credible
reason
to
believe
that
litigation
of
the
intelligence
of
negro
children
could
have
made
the
slightest
difference
in
the
outcome
of
this
lawsuit.
if
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
occupying
large
cardboard
boxes
on
file
on
this
court,
which
has
been
taken
down
on
that
issue.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
after
this
court's
decision
in
green
and
the
unequivocal
declaration
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
these
cases
or
earlier
face
of
these
cases,
the
freedom
of
choice
plans
could
be
sustained
at
this.
tons
and
tons
of
litigation
on
the
validity
of
freedom
of
choice
and
no
one
could
have
anticipated
that
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
would
have
injected
himself
into
this
case
in
taking
the
position
that
it
took.
the
profit
in
delay
for
those
who
would
maintain
segregation
is
that
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
is
one
of
segregation.
we
propose
that
in
this
case,
this
court
reverse
that
presumption
and
that
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
be
one
of
integration.
in
this
case
fortunately,
that
resolution
is
simple
enough
for
their
exist
plans
more
detailed
than
a
normally
available
in
any
school
desegregation
case.
they've
been
put
together
with
the
considerable
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
rule
does
not
rest
on
the
part
of
country
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
would
say
it
exists
in
a
--
come
into
play
in
a
variety
of
circumstances.
the
first
would
be
of
course
where
there
has
been
a
system
of
segregation
maintained
by
law.
we
must
just
establish
it
and
i
think
that's
been
established
in
case
like
carr
and
green
and
the
other
case
before
that.
the
second
is
that
where
the
history
of
the
case
demonstrates
that
protracted
and
interminable
litigation
is
a
means
for
maintaining
racial
segregation
because
it
stays
in
effect
if
litigation
was
on
and
on,
forever
and
forever.
some
sort
of
relief
in
the
nature
of
temporary
relief
must
be
given.
this
is
not
unknown
to
the
law,
that
law
knows
temporary
restraining
orders
and
those
injunctions
pending
appeal.
it
knows
the
use
of
various
writs
to
change
the
status
quo
in
the
situation
when
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
and
the
facts
absolutely
clear.
we
turn
out
to
be
wrong
which
i
would
submit
is
solely
very
doubtful
in
this
case,
we
can
go
back.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
--
if
one
looks
at
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
on
the
implementation
of
the
brown
decision,
one
does
not
try
in
this
degree
of
resistance
all
over
the
country,
one
finds
it
in
several
states,
one
finds
very
considerable
compliance
in
many
places
and
particularly
since
this
court's
decision
in
green
as
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
show,
there
has
been
a
very
mark
increased
in
desegregation
but
not
so
in
districts
such
as
this.
and
that's
why
the
normal
judicial
principles
of
entering
interlocutory
relief
on
a
not
yet
fully
litigated
case
should
come
into
play
here.
we
have
these
plans
here,
they
have
as
much
detail
as
any
plans
implemented
in
any
case
it
had.
we
don't
exist
--
insist
that
they
are
perfect.
i
don't
think
one
could
insist
that
about
plans
which
had
indeed
been
fully
litigated
but
they
are
better
than
what
exists
because
what
exist
is
racial
segregation
contoured
at
the
constitution
of
united
states.
we
urge
this
court
to
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
require
the
district
courts
and
as
to
these
plans
pendente
lite
except
of
the
plans
from
ready
in
its
homes
to
take
effect
now
and
any
further
litigation
including
appeals
should
take
place
with
these
plans
in
effect
not
over
to
--
not
over
a
period
of
years.
this
would
only
place
respondent
districts
at
the
risk
as
in
the
entry
of
any
temporary
restraining
order
that
having
desegregated
later
they
might
prevail
on
the
merits
that
some
court
might
hold
that
segregation
is
permissible
or
that
freedom
of
choice
such
as
they
propose
is
permissible.
we
say
there's
a
very
slight
likelihood
to
the
point
of
insignificance
of
either
of
those
occurring.
to
institute
these
plans
pendente
lite,
places
respondents
in
a
situation
which
will
interrupt
the
school
year
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
in
his
question.
you
know,
we
don't
view
that
lightly
but
school
years
are
interrupted
for
varieties
of
reasons
as
i
stated
in
response
to
his
questions.
the
national
education
association
which
knows
the
thing
or
two
about
education
has
filed
the
brief
as
a
friend
to
the
court
in
this
case
and
said
there
was
no
reason
why
the
desegregation
should
not
occur
immediately
in
the
respondent
school
districts.
and
indeed
there
is
some
considerable
educational
game
to
be
achieved
by
showing
children
that
the
laws
cannot
be
flooded
with
approval.
in
this
case,
i
was
reminded
in
preparing
the
argument
that
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
in
the
case
of
aaron
against
cooper
at
little
rock
school
case.
this
morning
in
the
library
i
went
and
took
a
look
to
see
whether
or
not
it
was
indeed
apposite
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
what
i
think
was
one
of
the
great
oral
arguments
in
this
court
which
some
members
of
the
bench
have
heard.
mr.
rankin
said
and
i
think
it
bears
on
the
question
of
the
interruption
of
education.
if
out
of
this
difficulty
and
undesired
situation,
the
people
of
little
rock
and
these
children
who
shouldn't
be
hurt
by
this
problems
learn
the
constitutional
rights
in
this
country
are
precious
that
they
have
a
duty
to
this
negro
boys
and
girls
in
this
community
to
help
them
get
their
constitutional
rights
and
this
constitutional
rights
happens
to
be
the
right
to
enter
a
school.
that
isn't
segregated
but
someday
they
will
want
other
constitutional
rights
and
be
able
to
exercise
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press
and
everything
else
that
we
consider
so
wonderful
in
our
form
of
government
and
you
cant
tear
down
a
part
of
those
rights
without
losing
others
in
the
process
and
there
wasn't
any
part
of
this
country
that
doesn't
have
a
tremendous
state
in
maintaining
each
and
all
of
those
rights
for
all
of
its
people.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
our
view
of
the
government's
position
in
its
brief.
now
the
government's
position
in
this
case
has
changed
considerably
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation.
as
finally
formulated
in
the
brief
which
is
filed
in
this
court,
it
makes
four
main
points.
it
first
says
that
hew
plans
need
not
be
submitted
until
december
1st
because
hew
may
“perhaps
want
to
correct
or
refine
them
on
page
5.”
our
position
is
that's
not
adequate,
we
don't
see
any
reason
in
the
world
to
wait
until
december
1st
that
if
they
know
there
are
any
mistakes
in
those
plans,
that
information
should
have
been
provided
to
the
court
with
the
brief
or
can
be
provided
today.
second,
they
say
formulation
of
a
workable
plan
followed
by
its
implementation
necessarily
requires
several
weeks
of
informed
effort
and
we
say
there
has
been
plenty
of
time.
that
we
think
that
the
people
who
drew
up
the
hew
plans
if
you
look
at
them
were
aware
of
these
needs
and
their
belief
was
that
the
need
for
human
relations
work
and
informing
people
about
how
to
work
together
in
the
desirability
of
following
the
constitution
could
be
done
simultaneously
and
best
in
the
context
of
actually
following
it.
they
say
that
implementation
may
be
had
for
example
a
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
my
understanding
is
there
is
no
mid-semester.
so
far
as
christmas
recess
is
concerned,
i
don't
see
why
that's
anymore
desirable
than
thanksgiving
recess
which
is
sooner
or
indeed
if
the
mandate
of
the
mechanical
work
and
the
court's
deliberations
can
be
completed
before
that
in
advance
that
no
reason
why
we
should
wait
this
long.
finally
and
this
is
the
part
of
their
position
that
we
find
most
distressing.
the
school
board
should
bear
the
burden
of
justifying
below
in
the
context
of
an
appropriately
expedited
appellate
review
schedule,
any
delay
beyond
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
this
to
me
is
an
indication
once
more
to
more
litigation
forever.
no
one
doubts
that
the
school
boards
in
these
cases
in
any
event,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
school
boards
are
not
doing
this.
we're
obeying
the
law
and
we're
having
substantial
amount
of
change
now
particularly
since
the
green
decision
but
no
one
doubts
of
these
school
boards
given
their
history
our
going
to
litigate
whatever
order
comes
out
of
here,
no
one
doubt
that
this
district
court
is
going
to
rule
with
them
and
they
were
going
to
be
in
the
merry-go-round
again,
going
up
and
around
and
around
again.
we
submit
that
in
these
cases,
we
have
plans,
those
plans
should
be
put
into
effect
that
those
plans
shall
be
the
status
quo
pendente
lite
and
then
they
want
to
litigate
forever,
they
can
do
it.
i
doubt
that
there
will
be
the
inventive.
mr.
satterfield's
position
i
think,
a
position
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
brief
which
i
have
submitted
indicated
as
their
disposition.
they
claim
that
mississippi
is
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
that
nothing
further
need
be
done
that
the
rule
of
law
is
being
obeyed.
i
think
i
need
make
no
comment
on
that.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
haven't
calculated
but
there
--
well,
no
because
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
that
he
says
that
we
can
keep
on
litigating
--
he
is
willing
to
have
us
litigate
forever
during
the
--
well
status
quo
segregation
is
maintained.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
doesn't
agree
with
our
position
on
pendente
lite
i
gather
and
the
states
various
objections
to
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
the
other
hand,
page
7,
since
we
agree
that
the
school
board's
obligation
to
desegregate
the
school
systems
is
a
median
unqualified.
we
believe
the
court
below
may
properly
be
authorized
to
acquire
the
implementation
of
the
plans
commencing
at
the
most
practical
eminent
juncture
in
the
school
year
as
for
example
christmas
recess
or
mid-semester.
moreover,
the
school
board
should
bear
the
burden
of
justifying
below
in
the
context
of
an
appropriately
expedited
appellate
review
schedule
any
delay
beyond
this
points
but
we've
had
expedited
appellate
review
schedules
here.
and
those
expedited
appellate
review
schedules
have
brought
us
here.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
had
not
read
that
way,
i
would
be
quite
please
if
the
department
of
justice
would
take
position
that
we
should
have
a
condition
of
desegregation
pendente
lite
but
nevertheless
we
do
disagree
on
the
timing.
i
see
no
point
and
waiting
for
thanksgiving,
certainly
not
for
christmas,
certainly
the
judicial
work
must
be
done
and
no
one
can
say
how
long
it
will
take
the
court
to
deliberate
and
come
to
a
conclusion.
but
if
the
court
should
come
to
a
conclusion
substantially
in
advance
of
that,
then
we
say
the
mandate
should
go
down
forthwith
and
those
rights
should
not
be
denied
one
moment
longer.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
suggest
an
order
that
the
plans
for
all
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
a
concrete
order,
the
order
should
mr.
justice
black
that
for
all
districts
in
this
litigation
with
the
exception
of
meridian
and
holmes,
the
plan
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
because
there
is
some
slight
revision
in
those
plans
necessary
which
i
think
would
take
a
matter
of
several
days
to
work
out
but
in
all
districts
except
those
plans,
except
those
two
districts.
these
plans
in
this
book
which
had
prepared
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
should
go
into
effect
instantaneously
taking
only
so
much
time
as
is
necessary
to
complete
the
mechanics
of
informing
the
parents
and
the
children
and
the
bus
drivers
and
the
teachers
and
in
any
event
no
more
than
eight
days
because
those
plans
were
drawn
up
to
be
implemented.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
i
have
a
--
that's
not
entirely
arbitrary
period
of
time.
that
period
of
time
is
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
directed
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
to
draw
a
plan
for
--
within
which
they
could
be
implemented.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
department
contemplated
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
certain
building
plans
were
in
process.
they
would
wait
for
those
plans
to
be
completed
and
consequently
desegregation
would
be
completed
there
in
the
1970-1971
school
year
instead
of
1969-1970.
while
we
would
certainly
conceive
that
there
might
be
a
much
more
desirable
situation
which
new
buildings
and
as
in
1970-1971,
we
say
they
should
do
the
best
they
can
with
the
existing
buildings
in
1969-1970
and
that
all
the
children,
black
and
white
alike
share
such
buildings
as
they
have
as
at
the
present
time
1970-1971
when
they
have
more
buildings,
they
can
then
redistribute
them
again.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
or
some
other
agency
selected
by
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
given
the
directions
within
a
brief
time
certain
to
make
the
necessary
revisions
and
those
plans
to
put
them
into
effect
right
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think
that
this
court
can
appraise
and
evaluate
the
quality
of
the
plans
on
the
record
that
has
been
made
about
them
without
reading
the
plans
themselves.
i
confess
i
have
subjected
myself
to
that
and
they
seem
like
any
other
plans.
and
they
certainly
come
with
better
credentials
than
any
other
plans
that
i
have
said.
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
enter
an
order
forthwith
directing
the
court
of
appeals
to
see
that
these
are
implemented,
i
don't
suggest
this
court
get
involved
in
the
details
of
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
not
as
that
the
--
we
--
there
was
no
opportunity
to
and
just
a
4333
to
this
litigation,
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
been
disposed
to
either
except
for
the
1970-1971
plans.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
except
that
within
that,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
moments
of
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
satterfield
has
made
regular
references
to
the
absence
of
a
record
in
this
court
and
i
think
that's
very
illuminating
because
i
might
say
at
the
outset
there
is
indeed
the
complete
record
in
this
court
and
it
has
been
here
for
some
considerable
period
of
time.
it's
in
mr.
davis'
office
right
behind
the
court.
it's
not
before
the
court
but
it's
behind
the
court.
the
problem
--
there
was
problem
however
in
obtaining
this
record
and
it
teaches
us
something
about
this
litigation.
when
we
file
this
case
here,
we
ask
the
clerk
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
send
up
the
record.
he
sent
up
everything
that
he
had.
however,
part
of
the
record
was
in
judge
cox's
court.
we
request
that
judge
cox's
clerk
to
send
the
record
up
and
he
refused.
we
sent
a
lawyer
to
visit
the
clerk
and
the
clerk
said
that
he
wanted
50
cents
a
page
for
the
record
and
we
said
we
didn't
want
it
and
we
could
not
pay
all
that
money
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
record.
and
the
lawyer
went
and
visited
judge
cox
and
judge
cox
said,
he
would
not
send
the
record
up
and
indeed,
he
thought
the
price
have
gone
up.[laughter]
but
we
then
communicated
with
mr.
davis
of
this
court
through
processes
of
communication
with
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
was
able
to
obtain
the
record
and
it
sits
in
there
in
eight
huge
boxes
for
anyone
who
cares
to
read
it.
that
is
the
story
of
the
litigation
in
this
case.
judge
cox
doesn't
let
you
have
the
record
and
mr.
satterfield
says,
you
don't
belong
in
this
court
because
you
don't
have
it.
the
fact
is
however,
we
do
have
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
reference
to
further
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
about
whether
the
rule
we
propose
here
is
for
only
one
part
of
the
country.
the
pendente
lite
rule
which
is
what
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
had
reference
to
is
particularly
appropriate
in
these
cases
because
here
we
have
substantially
or
fully
matured
plans
which
are
capable
of
being
put
into
effect
and
perhaps
completely
or
certainly
almost
close
to
completely
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
this
court's
decision
in
brown
as
elucidated
in
many
later
decisions.
i
think
that's
what
peculiarly
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
particular
case
and
it's
not
a
sectional
suggestion
but
one
that
adverts
to
the
circumstances
here.
now,
this
country
has
made
the
men
strides
in
eradicating
the
stigma
of
slavery
since
and
largely
as
result
to
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education.
the
principle
of
those
cases
has
been
important
not
only
in
theory
but
because
of
actual
implementation
which
shows
that
this
court
and
this
nation
stands
behind
the
theory.
conversely,
a
retreat
from
the
principles
of
brown
as
well
as
what
that
retreat
would
symbolize
will
tell
the
country
more
than
many
volumes
of
mere
rhetoric
about
what
the
country
stands.
plessy
against
ferguson
symbolized
the
retreat
from
the
principles
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
was
followed
by
not
even
a
separate
but
equal
doctrine
which
it
professed.
it
is
crucial,
we
submit,
that
if
we
are
to
continue
in
the
path
of
bringing
the
black
and
the
white
citizens
of
this
country
together.
of
course,
which
was
resumed
by
the
brown
decision
after
more
than
half
a
century
following
plessy
versus
ferguson
that
this
court
may
clear
in
this
case,
in
which
the
real
issue
is
whether
we
shall
continue
to
go
forward
or
halt
that
the
rights
of
the
constitution
are
for
the
here
and
now
and
not
merely
stuff
about
which
lawyers
play
charades.
but
there
is
more
in
this
case
than
the
relations
of
america's
black
to
white
citizens
crucial
as
that
is.
in
one
of
his
great
opinions
for
almost
a
quarter
of
century
ago,
mr.
justice
rutledge
voiced
in
dissent
an
admonition
that
has
special
application
today.
he
said,
“it
is
not
too
early,
it
is
never
too
early
for
the
nation
steadfastly
to
follow
its
great
constitutional
traditions.
it
can
become
too
late.”
every
one
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
schoolchildren,
black
and
white
in
the
14
school
districts
encompass
by
this
litigation
entered
the
public
schools
of
mississippi
years
after
the
day,
may
17,
1954
when
this
court
announced
that
segregation
and
the
constitution
cannot
co-exist.
yet
no
more
than
a
handful
of
these
children,
has
attended
a
lawfully
constituted
school.
thus
far
then,
out
of
their
life
experience,
the
black
and
white
schoolchildren
in
these
14
school
districts
have
not
learned
that
the
constitution
is
to
be
protected
and
defended,
cherished
and
lived.
today,
we
ask
this
court
to
direct
the
entry
of
decrees
ordering
desegregation
now.
with
the
constitution
to
be
the
rule
of
decision
pendente
lite,
we
asked
this
not
merely
because
another
forth
night
of
a
dual
schools
system
is
intolerable.
but
rather
because
another
forth
night
upon
warranted
displacement
of
the
constitution
is
intolerable.
the
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
children
in
these
school
districts
and
indeed
the
children
in
every
school
district
throughout
our
beloved
land
are
at
last
to
learn
that
there
was
supreme
law
of
the
land
binding
upon
children
or
parents,
binding
upon
school
boards,
binding
upon
the
states,
binding
upon
the
united
states
and
binding
upon
and
enforced
by
this
high
federal
law.
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
in
this
concurring
opinion
in
sweezy
against
new
hampshire,
“but
in
the
end,
judgment
cannot
be
escaped,
the
judgment
of
this
court.”
