mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
of
all
would
respectfully
request
this
court
seriously
consider
affirming
the
judgments
of
the
courts
below.
and
before
the
questioning
of
the
counsel
who
previously
argued
here
completely
takes
over
the
situation,
may
i
urge
this
court
not
to
be
too
caught
up
in
the
frustration
that
counsel
have
portrayed
to
the
court
today.
i
don't
mean
by
that
for
a
moment
to
imply
but
there
isn't
a
great
deal
of
frustration
involved
or
there
is.
let
me
just
for
a
few
moments
to
set
the
stage
for
a
very
brief
argument
that
i'm
going
to
make
today,
give
you
a
little
background
on
where
we
stand
with
respect
to
southern
school
desegregation,
because
i
unfortunately
think
there
are
those
who
take
an
entirely
too
pessimistic
point
of
view
and
i
for
one
would
like
to
be
on
the
side
of
taking
more
optimistic
point
of
view
and
i
think
those
of
us
who
deal
daily
with
the
problems
of
school
desegregation
can
safely
say
to
this
court
that
we
have
made
some
rather
substantial
breakthroughs
in
school
desegregation
and
in
truth
and
in
fact
the
end
of
the
road
is
in
sight.
it
is
in
sight
admittedly
a
long
way
but
it
is
in
sight.
first
of
all,
we're
now
in
the
error
of
green
and
counsel
continued
to
refer
to
the
green
decision
as
a
--
an
important
turning
point
and
indeed
it
was
an
important
turning
point
but
green
was
handed
down
by
this
court
just
18
months
ago.
prior
to
green,
the
requirements
which
were
laid
down
by
this
court
could
in
the
main
be
met
by
a
school
district
adopting
some
sort
of
a
free
transfer
plan
generally
put
together
in
the
phrase
freedom
of
choice
and
upon
doing
this,
the
school
district
was
generally
considered
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
mandates
of
the
court
but
green
changed
all.
and
since
the
time
of
green
there
has
been
substantial
progress,
both
substantively
as
well
as
procedure
in
school
desegregation,
whereas
in
the
14
years
from
brown
one
to
green,
only
approximately
20%
of
the
negro
children
in
southern
schools
had
moved
in
to
desegregated
schools.
in
the
one
school
year
which
was
affected
by
the
green
decision,
at
according
to
the
figures
supplied
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
that
one
school
year
after
the
effective
date
agreement,
that
figure
almost
doubled
so
that
today
it's
approximately
40%
again
in
the
southern
states.
now
whether
that
figure
is
completely
accurate
or
not,
is
not
the
important
issue.
mr.
jeris
leonard
of
the
total
number
of
negro
children
involved.
mr.
jeris
leonard
who
are
in
these
school
districts
in
these
southern
states.
in
the
southern
states
and
i'm
talking
about
now
that
the
jury
school
districts
without
reference
to
what
may
be
the
fact
in
de
facto
of
school
situation.
obviously,
it
is
going
to
be
much
less
than
that
when
you
take
those
into
effect
but
we
are
talking
today
about
school
districts
where
segregation
of
the
races
was
official,
was
official
policy.
but
what
is
material
about
the
green
decision
and
what
is
important.
is
that
it
literally
opened
up
a
new
era
for
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
these
negro
children
on
the
one
hand?
also
the
educational
benefits
to
white
children
and
they
are
there
of
desegregated
education.
so
we
are
little
genuinely,
a
little
disturbed
about
those
who
become
frustrated
and
say
it's
been
15
years
since
brown.
well,
that's
true
but
it's
more
true
to
say
it's
been
18
months
since
green
because
that's
when
the
important
turning
point
we
feel
came
about
in
substantial
progress
in
--
is
coming
at.
now,
let
me
give
you
specific
examples.
in
nine
deep
south
states,
there
are
better
than
1100
school
districts.
prior
to
the
green
decision,
more
than
200
of
those
were
in
fact
already
desegregated,
leaving
900
affected
by
the
green
decision.
since
green,
400
of
those
900
are
either
desegregated
or
have
in
the
works
in
implementation
satisfactory
at
least
according
to
the
district
courts,
satisfactory
desegregation
plans
therein
operation.
another
100
including
these
33
are
subject
to
so-called
green
motions
to
improve
the
status
in
those
districts
leaving
400
in
which
no
effective
efforts
are
at
this
point
being
made
on
behalf
of
the
children
in
those
400
districts.
mr.
jeris
leonard
there's
nothing
going
on
here.
and
many
of
those
are
districts
whose
federal
are
substantial
number
better
than
25%
are
districts
whose
federal
funds
have
been
cut
off
or
just
literally
their
line
follow,
so
to
speak.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
frank
to
say
that
where
our
figures
for
the
north
are
very
scarce
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
department
has
commenced
the
jury
type
litigation
against
northern
school
districts
where
it
has
been
found.
and
it
has
commenced
litigation
or
at
least
investigated
segregation
of
faculties
even
in
de
facto,
northern
school
districts.
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
procedural
problem
at
least
with
respect
to
the
government
and
that's
the
requirements
of
title
iv
of
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
attorney
general
must
have
a
written
complaint
from
a
parent
before
he
can
initiate
litigation.
so,
that
does
have
an
effect
on
these
remaining
400.
we
have
asked
the
congress
to
remove
that
and
hopefully,
that
may
be
done.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
green
as
it
applies
to
the
instant
case.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
anyone's
mind
that
green
required
these
school
boards
to
act.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we
must
be
cognizant
that
they
didn't
act.
whatever
the
reason
is
that
they
didn't
act,
they
didn't
act
and
there
are
many
other
districts
similarly
situated
like
these
33
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
it's
true.
that
fact
is
true
in
too
many
jurisdictions
and
therefore,
the
job
of
drawing
the
desegregation
plan
is
in
fact
going
to
fall
to
the
district
courts.
and
the
district
courts
in
many,
many
cases
have
called
upon
the
government.
they've
called
upon
h.e.w.
for
help
and
rightly
so
and
i
think
that
that's
going
to
--
it's
going
to
aid
the
total
desegregation
process.
the
attorney
general
himself
has
said
the
fact
that
you
can
call
upon
qualified
experts.
the
courts
can
at
h.e.w
to
help
in
this
process
is
going
to
assist
the
district
court,
assist
the
school
districts
themselves
if
they
want
to
be
assisted,
if
they
want
to
cooperate.
if
they
don't,
then
these
people
are
there
to
assist
the
district
courts
and
the
secretary
of
h.e.w
himself
has
joined
in
with
this
idea
of
using
these
educational
experts
to
aid
the
school
districts
and
the
district
courts.
but
i
plead
with
this
court
to
remember
that
these
people
are
professionals.
they
are
professional
educators
and
their
professional
judgment
must
be
given
some
weight.
it
must
be
given
some
credence
or
the
entire
experiment
is
going
to
fail
and
if
it
fails,
we
will
return
to
a
time
where
the
district
court
judge
and
the
lawyers
from
both
sides
will
be
sitting
across
from
each
other
with
the
school
district
map,
drawing
lines
and
sticking
pins
and
drawing
some
arrow
lines.
infringing,
in
truth,
and
in
--
and
i'm
not
talking
about
a
new
kent
county
type
of
case.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
two
school
district,
one
black
and
one
white.
but
there
are
districts
in
this
situation
among
these
cases
which
are
terribly
complicated.
mr.
jeris
leonard
complicated
your
honor.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
have
your
honor
and
i
disagree
with
it.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
disagree
with
it.
i
agree
however
with
the
two
experts
who
are
members
of
that
association,
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government,
with
respect
to
the
complexities
and
i'm
not
saying
that
all
the
districts
are
the
same.
some
of
them,
i'm
sure
are
very
simple.
mr.
greenberg
said,
there's
two
school
house
districts.
there
are
at
least
one
that
has
only
three
and
that
isn't
terribly
complicated.
but
there
are
complications
because
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
i
was
going
to
do
it
now.
i'm
just
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
what
this
court
has
required
in
green
is
a
reorganization
of
school
districts,
a
reorganization
that
is
really
in
fact
a
merger,
a
merger
of
two
separate
and
distinct
school
systems,
one
black
and
one
white
into
one.
now,
the
testimony
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
in
some
of
these
districts,
that
this
is
going
to
include
great
restructuring,
faculty
reorganization,
realigning
of
bus
routes,
readjustment
of
the
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
the
“what”
is
the
problem,
justice
black.
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
“what”
is
the
problem.
you
have
to
do
something
and
that
something
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
plan.
the
“it”
is
the
problem.
somebody
has
to
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
that
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
case.
that's
pendente
lite
argument.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
it's
terribly
wrong.
i
think
there
maybe
some
other
alternatives
to
this
frustration
that
may
be
felt.
mr.
jeris
leonard
my
point
is
that
the
frustration
i
think
is
more
properly
directed
to
the
18
months
because
it
was
with
green
that
this
court
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
pardon?
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
i
really
don't.[laughter]
i
really
don't
your
honor.
what
i'm
pleading
with
this
court
is
not
to
do
something
precipitous
like
the
pendente
lite
idea.
there
are
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
let
me
say
that
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
children
that
we're
talking
about
are
children
of
very
tender
age.
many
of
these
little
people
are
six,
and
seven,
and
eight,
nine
years
old
and
what
you
do
with
them
can
have
an
affect
on
their
total
future
life.
we
want
to,
i
hope
that
our
point
is,
we're
trying
to
improve
the
education
of
the
negro
children.
we
know
we
will
improve
the
education
of
the
white
children
by
desegregation,
anyway.
but
let's
try
to
do
it
with
some
order.
let's
not
send
children
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
am
not.
i
don't
believe
that's
a
law
now,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that's
by
the
boards.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
that
aaron
and
cooper
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anyone
who
wouldn't
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think
that
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall
but
i
think
it
was
in
green
that
this
court
articulated
the
need
to
have
plans.
plans
realistically
designed
to
work
now.
that's
we
believe,
that's
what
the
law
is.
the
question
is
you
got
to
get
the
plan.
you
got
to
find
the
way
to
get
the
plan
into
effect,
into
a
court
order
in
these
situations.
because
the
districts
in
too
many
situations
will
not
voluntarily
put
these
plans
into
effect
and
that's
the
point
i
made.
let
me
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
disagreement
about
that.
there
is
some
clear
cut
testimony
from
both
of
the
witnesses
and
i
might
point
out
to
this
court
it
is
based
on
the
testimony
of
people
like
the
two
witnesses
that
the
government
presented
that
the
secretary
acted
and
did
what
he
did.
this
wasn't
something
that
he
pulled
out
of
the
air.
he
acted
upon
the
advice
of
the
people
who
were
involved
in
the
drawing
of
these
plans
and
what
they
say
is
really
two
things.
number
one,
there
are
elements
to
these
plans
that
need
validation.
for
instance,
there
is
in
one
school
district,
the
substantial
reorganization
of
the
bus
routes
but
there's
no
bus
routes
drawn.
now,
are
we
to
ask
six,
seven,
eight,
nine-year-old
children
who
stand
out
in
the
street
corner
waiting
for
a
bus
that
the
bus
driver
doesn't
know
where
to
take.
that
can
be
overcome
in
a
short
period
of
time.
i
don't
point
that
out
as
being
any
great
difficult
but
the
fact
to
the
plans
is
--
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
plans
as
filed
were
not
as
refined,
as
incomplete
as
they
could've
been
if
these
men
who
worked
nights,
weekend,
i'm
talking
about
the
educators,
if
they
had
an
opportunity
to
really
refine
them.
that's
problem
number
one.
problem
number
two
was
that
september
1st
is
the
key
day
because
it
was
september
1st
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
down
as
decision
day.
now,
the
plans
would
have
gone
into
effect
on
december
1st.
in
the
first
place,
some
of
the
school
districts
would
already
have
been
opened,
three
or
four
or
five,
i'm
not
sure
just
how
many
but
some
of
them
would.
majority
of
them
were
opening,
i
believe
on
september
2nd
the
next
day
because
september
1st
was
labor
day
and
the
following
were
opening
the
following
week
september
7th.
now,
i
plead
with
this
court
that
decision
day
and
implementation
day
and
school
opening
day
were
all
on
the
same
day.
now,
that
can't
be.
we
certainly
can't
organize
our
affairs
given
a
reasonable
period
of
time
not
deliberate
speed
by
any
means
but
some
reasonable
opportunity
given
the
--
allowing
these
professionals
some
reasonable
chance
to
work
their
professional
judgment.
there's
no
question
what
the
eventual
result
has
to
be
here
and
it's
got
to
be
soon.
mr.
jeris
leonard
and
they
have
been
meeting
with
the
school
districts
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
white,
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
meet
with
the
people
involved
regularly.
mr.
jeris
leonard
not
dissatisfaction
so
much
with
the
total
plan
as
with
the
lack
of
ability
to
validate
the
plans
to
conduct
uncertain
peripherals.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
not
basically.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i'm
certain
that
they
still
do
not
at
least
at
the
last
juncture
of
my
talking
to
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
they
did.
mr.
jeris
leonard
they
still
do.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think,
i
doubt
very
much
that
there
was
any
testimony
that
related
specifically
to
any
period
of
delay.
it
was
simply
the
shock
that
this
was
all
occurring
on
the
same
day.
mr.
jeris
leonard
but
they
had
two
things,
as
i
indicated
it.
they
felt
the
need
to
validate
some
parts
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
is
to
conduct
some
additional
studies
to
determine.
let
me
give
you
an
example
mr.
justice
white.
for
four
weeks,
the
counsel
mentioned,
mr.
oberdorfer
mentioned
bogalusa.
for
four
weeks
i
was
in
louisiana
during
the
school
openings
down
there
and
i
went
to
a
school
in
one
parish
in
which
there
were
500
children
standing
outside
door
because
somebody
miscounted
the
number
of
people,
number
of
youngsters
who
were
inside
that
particular
school
zone.
now,
those
plans
also
were
prepared
in
a
little
longer
time
frame
than
these
but
you
will
recall
that
the
louisiana,
you
may
not
but
the
louisiana
appeals
were
handled
just
prior
to
the
mississippi
appeals
by
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
that's
what
can
come
about
when
a
validation
as
mr.
solons
and
mr.
jordan
in
their
testimony
indicated
is
not
done.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
the
plans
if
this
court
does
nothing
with
this
lawsuit
between
now
and
december
1st,
the
plans
will
be
submitted
on
december
1st
and
all
of
those
elements
of
the
plans
which
can
be
implemented
according
to
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
all
of
those
which
have
any
reasonable
hope
of
being
implemented
during
this
school
year.
when
i
say
elements,
there
are
various
elements
in
the
desegregation
plan.
all
of
those
that
can
be
implemented
in
the
1969-1970
school
will
be
--
school
year
will
be,
again,
this
is
dependant
upon
the
decision
by
the
district
court
but
our
urging
will
be
--
let
me
put
it
that
way.
and
if
there
are
any
elements
in
those
desegregation
plans
which
cannot
be
implemented
during
this
school
year,
we
will
expect
the
school
boards
to
come
forth
and
meet
the
burden
and
show
why
that
particular
element
or
those
particular
elements
in
that
plan
cannot
be
met.
mr.
jeris
leonard
yes.
mr.
jeris
leonard
you
have
a
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
you
have
one
of
the
school
districts,
i
think
has
some
11,000
and
there
are
some
others
in
the
package
of
33
here
that
have
some
fairly
good
number
of
students.
many
times,
the
school
reorganization,
mr.
justice
white,
will
call
for
the
building
of
middle
schools,
separating
a
grade
structure.
many,
if
you
look
at
these
plans,
you'll
find
many
of
these
schools
are
k
through
12,
k
through
eight
plus
a
high
school.
their
grade
school
feeding,
feeding
high
schools
and
please
understand
i'm
not
an
educational
expert
by
any
means
but
what
many
times
will
happen
is
in
a
reorganization
of
a
school
district,
you
will
adopt
an
elementary
school
structure,
one
through
four,
one
through
six,
a
middle
school
structure
and
a
senior
high
school
structure.
now,
it
can
well
be
that
either
through
the
construction
of
temporary
or
permanent
facility.
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
mr.
justice
white.
there's
11
--
there's
11,000
students
in
one
of
the
districts
and
there
are
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
mr.
solon's
testimony
was
that
in
his
opinion,
he's
the
one
who
worked
on
the
holmes
county,
the
big
district,
or
heinz
county.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
holmes
or
heinz,
in
any
event
the
big
one,
that
he
felt
that
there
was
not
any
reason
why
the
plan
could
not
be
fully
and
completely
implemented
totally
by
next
september.
in
other
words,
even
with
--
even
those
elements
that
might
need
some
delay
that
they
would
not
go
beyond
the
1970-1971
school
year.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that's
only
for
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
is
the
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
for
a
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that's
correct
justice.
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
not
always.
green
versus
new
kent
county
wasn't
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
may
be
wrong
mr.
justice
black
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
fourth
circuit
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
green
throughout
freedom
of
choice
made
it
clear
that
the
--
unless
they
really
had
worked
that
and
said
you
needed
a
plan
and
that
i
think
is
what
everyone
is
struggling
for
is
to
get
the
plan
before
the
court.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
--
[laughter]
we
hope
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
report
was
made,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
in
service
training
and
the
rest
of
it
is
going
on
right
now.
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
report
was
made.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
of
all
would
respectfully
request
this
court
seriously
consider
affirming
the
judgments
of
the
courts
below.
and
before
the
questioning
of
the
counsel
who
previously
argued
here
completely
takes
over
the
situation,
may
i
urge
this
court
not
to
be
too
caught
up
in
the
frustration
that
counsel
have
portrayed
to
the
court
today.
i
don't
mean
by
that
for
a
moment
to
imply
but
there
isn't
a
great
deal
of
frustration
involved
or
there
is.
let
me
just
for
a
few
moments
to
set
the
stage
for
a
very
brief
argument
that
i'm
going
to
make
today,
give
you
a
little
background
on
where
we
stand
with
respect
to
southern
school
desegregation,
because
i
unfortunately
think
there
are
those
who
take
an
entirely
too
pessimistic
point
of
view
and
i
for
one
would
like
to
be
on
the
side
of
taking
more
optimistic
point
of
view
and
i
think
those
of
us
who
deal
daily
with
the
problems
of
school
desegregation
can
safely
say
to
this
court
that
we
have
made
some
rather
substantial
breakthroughs
in
school
desegregation
and
in
truth
and
in
fact
the
end
of
the
road
is
in
sight.
it
is
in
sight
admittedly
a
long
way
but
it
is
in
sight.
first
of
all,
we're
now
in
the
error
of
green
and
counsel
continued
to
refer
to
the
green
decision
as
a
--
an
important
turning
point
and
indeed
it
was
an
important
turning
point
but
green
was
handed
down
by
this
court
just
18
months
ago.
prior
to
green,
the
requirements
which
were
laid
down
by
this
court
could
in
the
main
be
met
by
a
school
district
adopting
some
sort
of
a
free
transfer
plan
generally
put
together
in
the
phrase
freedom
of
choice
and
upon
doing
this,
the
school
district
was
generally
considered
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
mandates
of
the
court
but
green
changed
all.
and
since
the
time
of
green
there
has
been
substantial
progress,
both
substantively
as
well
as
procedure
in
school
desegregation,
whereas
in
the
14
years
from
brown
one
to
green,
only
approximately
20%
of
the
negro
children
in
southern
schools
had
moved
in
to
desegregated
schools.
in
the
one
school
year
which
was
affected
by
the
green
decision,
at
according
to
the
figures
supplied
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
in
that
one
school
year
after
the
effective
date
agreement,
that
figure
almost
doubled
so
that
today
it's
approximately
40%
again
in
the
southern
states.
now
whether
that
figure
is
completely
accurate
or
not,
is
not
the
important
issue.
mr.
jeris
leonard
of
the
total
number
of
negro
children
involved.
mr.
jeris
leonard
who
are
in
these
school
districts
in
these
southern
states.
in
the
southern
states
and
i'm
talking
about
now
that
the
jury
school
districts
without
reference
to
what
may
be
the
fact
in
de
facto
of
school
situation.
obviously,
it
is
going
to
be
much
less
than
that
when
you
take
those
into
effect
but
we
are
talking
today
about
school
districts
where
segregation
of
the
races
was
official,
was
official
policy.
but
what
is
material
about
the
green
decision
and
what
is
important.
is
that
it
literally
opened
up
a
new
era
for
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
these
negro
children
on
the
one
hand?
also
the
educational
benefits
to
white
children
and
they
are
there
of
desegregated
education.
so
we
are
little
genuinely,
a
little
disturbed
about
those
who
become
frustrated
and
say
it's
been
15
years
since
brown.
well,
that's
true
but
it's
more
true
to
say
it's
been
18
months
since
green
because
that's
when
the
important
turning
point
we
feel
came
about
in
substantial
progress
in
--
is
coming
at.
now,
let
me
give
you
specific
examples.
in
nine
deep
south
states,
there
are
better
than
1100
school
districts.
prior
to
the
green
decision,
more
than
200
of
those
were
in
fact
already
desegregated,
leaving
900
affected
by
the
green
decision.
since
green,
400
of
those
900
are
either
desegregated
or
have
in
the
works
in
implementation
satisfactory
at
least
according
to
the
district
courts,
satisfactory
desegregation
plans
therein
operation.
another
100
including
these
33
are
subject
to
so-called
green
motions
to
improve
the
status
in
those
districts
leaving
400
in
which
no
effective
efforts
are
at
this
point
being
made
on
behalf
of
the
children
in
those
400
districts.
mr.
jeris
leonard
there's
nothing
going
on
here.
and
many
of
those
are
districts
whose
federal
are
substantial
number
better
than
25%
are
districts
whose
federal
funds
have
been
cut
off
or
just
literally
their
line
follow,
so
to
speak.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
douglas,
i'm
frank
to
say
that
where
our
figures
for
the
north
are
very
scarce
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
department
has
commenced
the
jury
type
litigation
against
northern
school
districts
where
it
has
been
found.
and
it
has
commenced
litigation
or
at
least
investigated
segregation
of
faculties
even
in
de
facto,
northern
school
districts.
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
procedural
problem
at
least
with
respect
to
the
government
and
that's
the
requirements
of
title
iv
of
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
attorney
general
must
have
a
written
complaint
from
a
parent
before
he
can
initiate
litigation.
so,
that
does
have
an
effect
on
these
remaining
400.
we
have
asked
the
congress
to
remove
that
and
hopefully,
that
may
be
done.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
green
as
it
applies
to
the
instant
case.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
anyone's
mind
that
green
required
these
school
boards
to
act.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
we
must
be
cognizant
that
they
didn't
act.
whatever
the
reason
is
that
they
didn't
act,
they
didn't
act
and
there
are
many
other
districts
similarly
situated
like
these
33
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
it's
true.
that
fact
is
true
in
too
many
jurisdictions
and
therefore,
the
job
of
drawing
the
desegregation
plan
is
in
fact
going
to
fall
to
the
district
courts.
and
the
district
courts
in
many,
many
cases
have
called
upon
the
government.
they've
called
upon
h.e.w.
for
help
and
rightly
so
and
i
think
that
that's
going
to
--
it's
going
to
aid
the
total
desegregation
process.
the
attorney
general
himself
has
said
the
fact
that
you
can
call
upon
qualified
experts.
the
courts
can
at
h.e.w
to
help
in
this
process
is
going
to
assist
the
district
court,
assist
the
school
districts
themselves
if
they
want
to
be
assisted,
if
they
want
to
cooperate.
if
they
don't,
then
these
people
are
there
to
assist
the
district
courts
and
the
secretary
of
h.e.w
himself
has
joined
in
with
this
idea
of
using
these
educational
experts
to
aid
the
school
districts
and
the
district
courts.
but
i
plead
with
this
court
to
remember
that
these
people
are
professionals.
they
are
professional
educators
and
their
professional
judgment
must
be
given
some
weight.
it
must
be
given
some
credence
or
the
entire
experiment
is
going
to
fail
and
if
it
fails,
we
will
return
to
a
time
where
the
district
court
judge
and
the
lawyers
from
both
sides
will
be
sitting
across
from
each
other
with
the
school
district
map,
drawing
lines
and
sticking
pins
and
drawing
some
arrow
lines.
infringing,
in
truth,
and
in
--
and
i'm
not
talking
about
a
new
kent
county
type
of
case.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
two
school
district,
one
black
and
one
white.
but
there
are
districts
in
this
situation
among
these
cases
which
are
terribly
complicated.
mr.
jeris
leonard
complicated
your
honor.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
have
your
honor
and
i
disagree
with
it.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
disagree
with
it.
i
agree
however
with
the
two
experts
who
are
members
of
that
association,
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government,
with
respect
to
the
complexities
and
i'm
not
saying
that
all
the
districts
are
the
same.
some
of
them,
i'm
sure
are
very
simple.
mr.
greenberg
said,
there's
two
school
house
districts.
there
are
at
least
one
that
has
only
three
and
that
isn't
terribly
complicated.
but
there
are
complications
because
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
i
was
going
to
do
it
now.
i'm
just
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
what
this
court
has
required
in
green
is
a
reorganization
of
school
districts,
a
reorganization
that
is
really
in
fact
a
merger,
a
merger
of
two
separate
and
distinct
school
systems,
one
black
and
one
white
into
one.
now,
the
testimony
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
in
some
of
these
districts,
that
this
is
going
to
include
great
restructuring,
faculty
reorganization,
realigning
of
bus
routes,
readjustment
of
the
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
the
“what”
is
the
problem,
justice
black.
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
“what”
is
the
problem.
you
have
to
do
something
and
that
something
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
plan.
the
“it”
is
the
problem.
somebody
has
to
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
justice
black,
that
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
case.
that's
pendente
lite
argument.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
it's
terribly
wrong.
i
think
there
maybe
some
other
alternatives
to
this
frustration
that
may
be
felt.
mr.
jeris
leonard
my
point
is
that
the
frustration
i
think
is
more
properly
directed
to
the
18
months
because
it
was
with
green
that
this
court
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
pardon?
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
i
really
don't.[laughter]
i
really
don't
your
honor.
what
i'm
pleading
with
this
court
is
not
to
do
something
precipitous
like
the
pendente
lite
idea.
there
are
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
black,
let
me
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
let
me
say
that
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
children
that
we're
talking
about
are
children
of
very
tender
age.
many
of
these
little
people
are
six,
and
seven,
and
eight,
nine
years
old
and
what
you
do
with
them
can
have
an
affect
on
their
total
future
life.
we
want
to,
i
hope
that
our
point
is,
we're
trying
to
improve
the
education
of
the
negro
children.
we
know
we
will
improve
the
education
of
the
white
children
by
desegregation,
anyway.
but
let's
try
to
do
it
with
some
order.
let's
not
send
children
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
am
not.
i
don't
believe
that's
a
law
now,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that's
by
the
boards.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
that
aaron
and
cooper
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anyone
who
wouldn't
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think
that
it
was
mr.
justice
marshall
but
i
think
it
was
in
green
that
this
court
articulated
the
need
to
have
plans.
plans
realistically
designed
to
work
now.
that's
we
believe,
that's
what
the
law
is.
the
question
is
you
got
to
get
the
plan.
you
got
to
find
the
way
to
get
the
plan
into
effect,
into
a
court
order
in
these
situations.
because
the
districts
in
too
many
situations
will
not
voluntarily
put
these
plans
into
effect
and
that's
the
point
i
made.
let
me
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
disagreement
about
that.
there
is
some
clear
cut
testimony
from
both
of
the
witnesses
and
i
might
point
out
to
this
court
it
is
based
on
the
testimony
of
people
like
the
two
witnesses
that
the
government
presented
that
the
secretary
acted
and
did
what
he
did.
this
wasn't
something
that
he
pulled
out
of
the
air.
he
acted
upon
the
advice
of
the
people
who
were
involved
in
the
drawing
of
these
plans
and
what
they
say
is
really
two
things.
number
one,
there
are
elements
to
these
plans
that
need
validation.
for
instance,
there
is
in
one
school
district,
the
substantial
reorganization
of
the
bus
routes
but
there's
no
bus
routes
drawn.
now,
are
we
to
ask
six,
seven,
eight,
nine-year-old
children
who
stand
out
in
the
street
corner
waiting
for
a
bus
that
the
bus
driver
doesn't
know
where
to
take.
that
can
be
overcome
in
a
short
period
of
time.
i
don't
point
that
out
as
being
any
great
difficult
but
the
fact
to
the
plans
is
--
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
the
plans
as
filed
were
not
as
refined,
as
incomplete
as
they
could've
been
if
these
men
who
worked
nights,
weekend,
i'm
talking
about
the
educators,
if
they
had
an
opportunity
to
really
refine
them.
that's
problem
number
one.
problem
number
two
was
that
september
1st
is
the
key
day
because
it
was
september
1st
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
down
as
decision
day.
now,
the
plans
would
have
gone
into
effect
on
december
1st.
in
the
first
place,
some
of
the
school
districts
would
already
have
been
opened,
three
or
four
or
five,
i'm
not
sure
just
how
many
but
some
of
them
would.
majority
of
them
were
opening,
i
believe
on
september
2nd
the
next
day
because
september
1st
was
labor
day
and
the
following
were
opening
the
following
week
september
7th.
now,
i
plead
with
this
court
that
decision
day
and
implementation
day
and
school
opening
day
were
all
on
the
same
day.
now,
that
can't
be.
we
certainly
can't
organize
our
affairs
given
a
reasonable
period
of
time
not
deliberate
speed
by
any
means
but
some
reasonable
opportunity
given
the
--
allowing
these
professionals
some
reasonable
chance
to
work
their
professional
judgment.
there's
no
question
what
the
eventual
result
has
to
be
here
and
it's
got
to
be
soon.
mr.
jeris
leonard
and
they
have
been
meeting
with
the
school
districts
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
justice
white,
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
meet
with
the
people
involved
regularly.
mr.
jeris
leonard
not
dissatisfaction
so
much
with
the
total
plan
as
with
the
lack
of
ability
to
validate
the
plans
to
conduct
uncertain
peripherals.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
not
basically.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i'm
certain
that
they
still
do
not
at
least
at
the
last
juncture
of
my
talking
to
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
they
did.
mr.
jeris
leonard
they
still
do.
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
think,
i
doubt
very
much
that
there
was
any
testimony
that
related
specifically
to
any
period
of
delay.
it
was
simply
the
shock
that
this
was
all
occurring
on
the
same
day.
mr.
jeris
leonard
but
they
had
two
things,
as
i
indicated
it.
they
felt
the
need
to
validate
some
parts
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
is
to
conduct
some
additional
studies
to
determine.
let
me
give
you
an
example
mr.
justice
white.
for
four
weeks,
the
counsel
mentioned,
mr.
oberdorfer
mentioned
bogalusa.
for
four
weeks
i
was
in
louisiana
during
the
school
openings
down
there
and
i
went
to
a
school
in
one
parish
in
which
there
were
500
children
standing
outside
door
because
somebody
miscounted
the
number
of
people,
number
of
youngsters
who
were
inside
that
particular
school
zone.
now,
those
plans
also
were
prepared
in
a
little
longer
time
frame
than
these
but
you
will
recall
that
the
louisiana,
you
may
not
but
the
louisiana
appeals
were
handled
just
prior
to
the
mississippi
appeals
by
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
that's
what
can
come
about
when
a
validation
as
mr.
solons
and
mr.
jordan
in
their
testimony
indicated
is
not
done.
mr.
jeris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
the
plans
if
this
court
does
nothing
with
this
lawsuit
between
now
and
december
1st,
the
plans
will
be
submitted
on
december
1st
and
all
of
those
elements
of
the
plans
which
can
be
implemented
according
to
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
all
of
those
which
have
any
reasonable
hope
of
being
implemented
during
this
school
year.
when
i
say
elements,
there
are
various
elements
in
the
desegregation
plan.
all
of
those
that
can
be
implemented
in
the
1969-1970
school
will
be
--
school
year
will
be,
again,
this
is
dependant
upon
the
decision
by
the
district
court
but
our
urging
will
be
--
let
me
put
it
that
way.
and
if
there
are
any
elements
in
those
desegregation
plans
which
cannot
be
implemented
during
this
school
year,
we
will
expect
the
school
boards
to
come
forth
and
meet
the
burden
and
show
why
that
particular
element
or
those
particular
elements
in
that
plan
cannot
be
met.
mr.
jeris
leonard
yes.
mr.
jeris
leonard
you
have
a
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
you
have
one
of
the
school
districts,
i
think
has
some
11,000
and
there
are
some
others
in
the
package
of
33
here
that
have
some
fairly
good
number
of
students.
many
times,
the
school
reorganization,
mr.
justice
white,
will
call
for
the
building
of
middle
schools,
separating
a
grade
structure.
many,
if
you
look
at
these
plans,
you'll
find
many
of
these
schools
are
k
through
12,
k
through
eight
plus
a
high
school.
their
grade
school
feeding,
feeding
high
schools
and
please
understand
i'm
not
an
educational
expert
by
any
means
but
what
many
times
will
happen
is
in
a
reorganization
of
a
school
district,
you
will
adopt
an
elementary
school
structure,
one
through
four,
one
through
six,
a
middle
school
structure
and
a
senior
high
school
structure.
now,
it
can
well
be
that
either
through
the
construction
of
temporary
or
permanent
facility.
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
mr.
justice
white.
there's
11
--
there's
11,000
students
in
one
of
the
districts
and
there
are
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
i
think
mr.
solon's
testimony
was
that
in
his
opinion,
he's
the
one
who
worked
on
the
holmes
county,
the
big
district,
or
heinz
county.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
holmes
or
heinz,
in
any
event
the
big
one,
that
he
felt
that
there
was
not
any
reason
why
the
plan
could
not
be
fully
and
completely
implemented
totally
by
next
september.
in
other
words,
even
with
--
even
those
elements
that
might
need
some
delay
that
they
would
not
go
beyond
the
1970-1971
school
year.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that's
only
for
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
is
the
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
for
a
part
of
the
plan.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that's
correct
justice.
mr.
jeris
leonard
no,
not
always.
green
versus
new
kent
county
wasn't
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
i
may
be
wrong
mr.
justice
black
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
fourth
circuit
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
jeris
leonard
green
throughout
freedom
of
choice
made
it
clear
that
the
--
unless
they
really
had
worked
that
and
said
you
needed
a
plan
and
that
i
think
is
what
everyone
is
struggling
for
is
to
get
the
plan
before
the
court.
mr.
jeris
leonard
well,
--
[laughter]
we
hope
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
jeris
leonard
that
report
was
made,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
in
service
training
and
the
rest
of
it
is
going
on
right
now.
mr.
jeris
leonard
the
report
was
made.
