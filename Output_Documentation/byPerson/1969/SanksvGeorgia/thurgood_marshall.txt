and
you
see
nothing
wrong
with

but
why
couldn't
a

point,
adversary

we
have
the
adversary

then
afterwards?
justice
thurgood

what

mean,
it

that

justice
thurgood

mr.
evans,
suppose
the
rents
did

the
first,
and
on
the

the
landlord
files
his
proceeding
and
it
so
develops
that
money
comes
in
on
the
second
after
he
files
it.
the
tenant's
in
trouble
isn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
contracts
that
are
payable
on
first
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
has
to
go,
now,
he
has
to
go
to
court
now
and
put
up
his
double
amount
of
money,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
remedy
would
he
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
fraud
they
made
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
to
require
him
to
go
to
court
in
order
to
remain
in
the
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
put
up,
double
the
amount
--
this
is
what
the
tenant
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
is
what
the
tenant
agreed
to
when
he
entered
into
a
lease
contract,
unless
he
could
stipulate
that
provision
away.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
contract
said
that
the
party,
second
party
is
always
pushing
--
party,
second
party
claims
all
of
his
due
process
rights
under

would
you

waives
it.

becuase
of

you
don't
want

do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
not
make
the

pull

gets
this
action?
justice
thurgood

i
thought
you

attorneys?
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

or
not
because
they
are
not
your
