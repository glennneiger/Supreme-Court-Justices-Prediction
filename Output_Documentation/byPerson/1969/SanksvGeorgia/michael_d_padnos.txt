mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
the
sanks
case
is
quite
different
than
the
issue
in
the
previous
case.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
today
is
whether
the
state
of
georgia
may
constitutionally
create
a
judicial
procedure
which
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
discriminates
against
all
tenants
and
in
favor
of
all
property
owners
in
the
state.
the
issue
is
thus
whether
a
state
can
divide
all
of
its
citizens
into
these
two
categories
and
discriminate
in
the
manner
presented
in
the
statute.
the
operation
of
the
statute
has
been
extensively
set
out
in
the
materials
before
the
court.
i
might
also
say
that
it
has
been
considered
before,
thus
this
statute
has
been
considered
before
in
the
case
of
williams
v.
shaffer.
as
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
a
statute
under
which
landlords
and
big
tenants
by
going
to
the
marshal
of
the
court
taking
out
a
bond
which
they
want,
which
cost
$6.00
and
without
any
further
proceeding
or
whatsoever,
tenants
are
evicted
from
their
premises.
the
only
way
a
tenant
can
arrest
these
proceedings
is
by
filing
with
the
court
a
counter-affidavit
and
with
that,
an
amount
of
bond
which
the
statute
doesn't
even
stipulate
to
guarantee
that
the
landlord
will
not
lose
either
his
money
or
double
his
money
at
the
final
determination
of
the
issue.
the
question
these
statutes,
these
statutory
provisions
present
first
go
to
the
heart
of
the
notion
of
due
process.
for
the
georgia
statute
permits
landlords
to
assert
rights
in
a
way
that's
completely
different
from
the
rights
the
tenants
have.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
this
statute
affects
all
landlords
and
all
tenants.
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
individual
or
corporate.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
tenant
has
a
valid
claim
or
has
no
claim
or
whatsoever.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
tenant
is
scrupulous
and
totally
disrupted.
everybody
is
affected
by
this
statute.
this
court
has
previously
dealt
with
an
issue
which
we
feel
is
directly
on
point
in
the
sniadach
case.
the
sniadach
case
which
was
a
due
process
case
like
this
one
involved
the
taking
of
property
of
a
person
before
there
was
any
court
hearing.
and
that's
the
crucial
question:
may
a
statute
take
away
somebody's
property
without
a
court
hearing?
in
sniadach,
the
court
held
that
it
could
not
do
so.
and
in
many
ways,
this
case
is
even
a
better
case
than
the
sniadach
case.
we
feel
we're
completely
within
that
case.
the
court
need
break
no,
no
ground
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
tenants
in
the
sanks
case.
we
have
a
much
narrower
case
than
theirs.
for
example
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
sniadach
case,
their,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
the
action
taken
--
that
led
to
the
case
being
brought
in
was
a
final
disposition
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
of
that.
it's
very
clear
that
once
the
tenant
is
out,
that's
a
final
disposition
of
that
matter.
there
was
also
a
question
in
the
sniadach
case
that
whether
the
matter
involve
was
de
minimis,
that
question
was
raised.
there's
no
question
about
this
case
being
de
minimis.
again,
the
tenant
is
out
on
the
street.
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
there
was
also
a
question
in
that
case
is
whether
the
tenant
had
--
whether
the
parties
to
that
case
had
demonstrated
poverty
and
whether
they
were
actually
going
to
be
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
here,
there's
a
specific
judicial
finding
in
the
lower
court
opinion
of
indigency
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
tenants
to
obtain
the
bond.
they
will
be
affected
by
the
statute
indeed.
they
would
be
affected
where
the
action
of
the
court
not
held
up
by
these
proceedings.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
the
fury
of
the
statute
is
that
only
one
tenant
is
holding
over.
may
the
--
may
a
landlord
go
into
court
under
this
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
in
fact,
under
any
conditions
or
no
conditions
where
the
landlord
can't
go
into
court
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
right.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
he
has
to
make
a
statement
under
oath
that
the
tenant
is
either
holding
over
or
always
--
i
believe
it's
that
he
owes
money
to
the
landlord.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
holding
over
beyond
the
term
of
his
lease
hold.
and
as
judge
williams
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court,
the
tenants
in
this
case
are
tenants
at
will
and
indeed,
that's
a
good
illustration
of
the
problem
with
the
statute.
the
tenants
or
tenants
at
will,
therefore
under
the
law,
they're
entitled
to
a
60-day
notice
to
vacate
and
theoretically,
the
landlord
can't
do
anything
against
them,
can't
take
any
action
to
evict
them
until
he
is
given
on
the
60-day
notice.
but
it
doesn't
work
that
way
and
what
happens
is
the
landlord
can
go
in
under
any
conditions.
now,
as
you
point
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
certainly
would
be
possible
for
a
tenant
later
on
to
bring
an
action
for
false
eviction
and
indeed,
georgia
supreme
court
makes
the
same
suggestion.
but
that
doesn't
do
a
tenant
any
good
once
he
has
been
evicted.
again,
as
you
point
out
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
not
money.
the
issue
involved
is
possession
and
that's
what
the
statute's
all
about.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
1827
and
has
been
periodically
modified
since
then.
but
nothing
in
substance
is
really
changed
since
1827.
it's
a
curious
and
acronism.
they're
just
is
in
the
statute
in
the
country
in
which
tenants
are
subjected
to
such
a
rigorous
and
immediate
eviction
and
landlords
are
given
such
gracious
privileges
as
the
georgia
eviction
statute
it.
indeed
in
thinking
about
asking
other
people
to
be
submit
amicus
brief
in
the
case,
we
couldn't
think
of
going
any
place
else
because
nobody
else
has
a
statute
like
this.
we're
just
unique
in
georgia
in
having
the
statute.
i
think
it's
important
when
talking
about
due
process
in
the
sniadach
case
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
feel
that
sniadach
was
an
aberration
in
the
court's
thinking.
sniadach
was
in
complete
context
with
what
the
court's
been
doing
for
a
long
time.
indeed
in
hovy
v.
eliot
again,
which
was
70
years
ago,
the
court
there
also
took
the
position
that
not
only
notice
was
necessary
in
order
for
a
due
process,
but
also
an
opportunity
to
heard.
the
usual
requisites
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
the
sniadach
case,
the
usual
requisites
of
due
process
are
noticed
in
the
prior
hearing.
indeed,
there
are
some
wonderful
languages
in
the
hovy
case
where
the
court
really
get
quite
upset
about
the
procedure
in
that
case
which
did
not
afford
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
said
that
a
judgment
issue
done
in
those
conditions
wants
all
the
attributes
of
the
judicial
determination.
it
is
judicial
user
patient
and
oppression
and
can
never
be
upheld
where
justice
is
justly
administered.
this
case
we
feel
is
quite
like.
there
has
been
notice
but
there
is
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
unless
the
tenant
presents
a
bond
which
in
our
case
certainly,
our
tenants
are
never
able
to
present
to
a
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
we
do
in
our
cases.
we've
sort
of
invented
a
procedure
in
these
cases.
we
have
applied
to
the
courts
for
rules
“nisi”
as
it's
called
in
georgia
and
we
do
pay
our
rent
in
the
court.
indeed
in
this
case,
in
the
moment
case
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
we
haven't
had
a
case
such
as
the
latter
one
but
we
do
have
cases
where
the
rent
is
in
contest.
indeed
everyday,
we
always
pay
the
rent
in
the
court.
and
as
the
georgia
supreme
court,
when
this
was
argued
before
them
said
“how
can
you
do
that?
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
that.”
and
indeed,
they're
right.
but
the
lower
court
have
taken
the
position
that
that's
fair
and
reasonable
that
the
contested
matter
be
put
into
the
court
and
then
will
decide
who
gets
it
at
the
end.
so,
we've
always
paid
our
rent
in
the
court
and
it's
being
paid
in
at
the
moment
case
which
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
sir,
it's
not
-
actually,
we're
not
before
an
equity
court,
we're
before
a
civil
court
which
has
no
equity
jurisdiction.
it's
just
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
separate
equity
court
which
also
has
other
powers,
but
a
separate
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
they
have
something
like
that
in
mind.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
it's
--
the
way
its
work
is
a
judge
is
just
issued
an
order,
so
stating
and
saying
the
parties
will
pick
--
that's
the
only
conditions
under
which
the
judge
is
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
foregoing
the
bond,
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
yes
sir,
but
even
since
then,
it's
been
operating
this
way.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
nothing's
going
on
with
the
supreme
court.
it
may
be
improper
to
say
so
but
many
people
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
statute
and
have
been
giving
us
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
that
question.
and
so,
we've
been
allowed
to
bring
cases
in
the
lower
court.
and
the
judge
is
always
kind
of
just
looked
down
and
says
“well,
i
shouldn't
be
doing
this,
but
i'm
going
to
let
you
file
it
anyway.”
that's
a
bit
the
way
it's
worth.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
we
have
excellent
lower
court
judge
that
support
the
county.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
you
could
tell
us
that
you
would
make
a
major
edition
to
georgia
jurisprudence
because
nobody
has
any
idea
whatsoever.
the
statutory
language
is
double
the
rent
reserve
to
stipulate
it
to
be
paid.
that
doesn't
say
that
was
owing
at
the
time.
it
doesn't
say
that
might
be
owing
later
and
indeed
as
the
briefs
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
one
court
interprets
it
in
that
way
and
did
the
fulton
county
civil
courts
until
we
begun
to
present
these
cases.
the
fulton
county
civil
court
interpreted
that
to
mean,
future
double
rent.
and
as
far
as
i
know
where
for
legal
aid
society
is
not
council
in
the
cases,
they
may
still
do
so.
they
take
a
year's
rent
because
the
clerk
has
just
decided
that
six
months
is
the
amount
of
time
that
this
case
may
last
and
then
therefore,
they
double
that
and
they
require
every
tenant
to
pay
a
year's
rent.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
it's
the
bond.
it's
a
fact
that
all
tenants
must
pay.
the
law
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
could
be.
well
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
not
if
you're
an
indigent.
in
this
case,
there
not
is,
but
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
which
we
claim
to
be,
and
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
is
a
finding.
yes
sir.
judge
williams's
opinion
on
page
38
of
the
appendix,
there's
a
specific
finding
of
indigency.
the
issue
that
we
present
to
the
court
is
the
due
process
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
case,
there's
so
many
different
ways
we
can
go.
the
statute
is
wrong
for
so
many
reasons.
there
so
many
defects
in
the
statute.
but
--
just
--
in
order
to
present
the
simplest
issue,
i
present
to
the
court
the
due
process
issue
which
is
just
obviously
wrong
on
other
cases,
on
common
sense,
on
decency
and
on
the
law.
we
could
also
argue
the
equal
protection
cases.
we
feel
it's
a
clear
violation
of
equal
protection
between
landlords
and
between
tenants.
i
could
get
into
the
question
of
equal
protection
between
rich
people
and
poor
people
but
i
don't
even
think
we
ever
need
to
reach
that
issue
because
the
statute
violates
equal
protection
simply
by
landlords
and
tenants.
that
your
honors
is
the
essence
of
our
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
court
there
list
two
very
specific
situations
when
we
could
go
into
equity.
where
there
is
no
landlord-tenant
relationship,
i
believe
is
one
of
them,
if
the
relationship
of
landlord
and
tenant
does
not
exist
and
the
acumen
is
unable
to
post
bond,
and
the
second
one,
if
the
landlord
had
tempted
to
oust
the
tenant
who
is
complaining
with
the
terms
of
his
lease.
but
the
equity
courts
don't
want
these
cases
and
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
into
equity
court
because
there
is
the
separation
of
jurisdiction.
landlord-tenant
cases
are
civil
court
cases.
at
least
in
fulton
county,
everybody
recognizes
that
and
acts
accordingly.
the
superior
court
which
is
out
court
of
equity
doesn't
wish
to
have
these
cases
and
always
says,
“go
find
your
remedy
in
civil
court,
that's
where
you
belong."
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
one
of
the
other
problems.
i
should
also
say
that
unlike
connecticut,
i
was
not
too
clear
of
the
connecticut
situation.
in
georgia,
the
bond
is
not
waived
for
both.
there
is
a
georgia
supreme
court
opinion
that
says
you
can't
waive
the
bond.
and
again,
the
lower
court
judges
who
just
sort
of
been
clearing
their
throats
and
looking
in
a
different
direction
and
allowing
landlords
to
waive
the
bond
when
they
wish
to
come
in.
but
as
a
general
rule,
there's
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
sir,
my
certainty
of
what
the
georgia
legislature
will
do,
i
would
like
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
i
think
i
was
substituting
hope
for
a
certainty.
i'd
certainly
hope
that
we
will
have
a
better
law
than
this.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
touch
on
several
things
mr.
evans
dealt
with.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
asked
the
question
about
the
common
law
issue.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
think
that's
been
too
clearly
presented.
in
fact,
the
common
law
that
the
landlord
did
not
have
the
right
of
common
law
just
to
evict
the
tenant
who
was
overdue
on
his
rent.
the
payment
of
rent
is
a
covenant,
which
required
the
landlord
to
go
into
court.
and
the
only
way
that
the
landlord
could
use
self
help
is
if
the
tenants
he
had
come
to
an
end,
but
that
was
not
because
the
rent
wasn't
paid.
so,
this
is
not
an
improvement
on
common
law
as
the
state
has
represented.
indeed
on
the
contrary,
it's
a
much
worst
condition
than
common
law.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir,
bur
we're
talking
about
is
our
right
to
present
defenses
in
court.
indeed,
one
of
the
cases
here
really
illustrates
the
badness
of
the
statute
of
the
momman
case
which
is
one
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
present
the
defense
on.
and
in
that
case,
what
have
happened
was
this
is
a
tenant
at
the
atlanta
housing
authority
and
mrs.
momman
is
a
white
woman
and
a
number
of
people
have
objected
to
the
fact
that
she
was
having
black
visitors
to
her
house,
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
project
manager
decided
to
evict
her
and
we
were
going
to
fight
that
in
court.
now
that
issue
obviously
is
not
for
this
court
and
it's
not
for
any
court
because
we
wanted
to
bring
it
the
court
and
that's
what
brought
mrs.
momman
into
that
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
files
an
affidavit
with
a
double
bond
and
mrs.
momman
is
a
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
we're
complaining
about
the
entire
procedure
sir.
that
we
could
not
get
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
appear
unless
he
files
a
double
bond.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
you're
asking,
i
take
it
as
if
there
were
no
bond
would
we
object
to
--
i
think
it
would
be
all
right,
then
if
there
was
no
bond
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
what
keeps
at
out
of
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
statute.
i
really
can't
comment
at
all.
what
i
was
referring
to
when
i
talked
about
statute
is
i
knew
that
some
statute
passed
the
state
senate.
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
mr.
evan's
is
referring
to.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
bill
is
passed
at
the
state
senate.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
bill,
but
i
knew
of
nothing
that
it
passed
the
house
of
representatives.
i'd
also
like
to
clear
up
but
i'm
afraid
it
might
be
a
misleading
impression
that
i
gave
about
the
georgia
legislature
and
also
about
the
courts
in
georgia.
i
didn't
mean
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
we
have
a
sort
of
happy
situation
down
there
where
everybody
agrees
and
everybody
can
do
what
they
want
even
though
the
law
says
the
opposite.
the
legislature
of
this
court
should
hold
the
statute
constitutional,
i
would
presume
there's
no
possibility
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
change
the
present
law,
and
as
far
as
the
courts
operating
in
our
benefit
in
the
kind
of
casual
way
that
i
talked
about
before,
the
court
should
doing
that
in
fulton
county
to
a
certain
extent.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they're
doing
it
nowhere
else.
and
indeed,
it
is
now
come
to
an
end
in
fulton
county
because
only
last
friday,
one
of
the
judges
in
the
civil
court
said
no
more,
i
am
not
waiting
anymore.
i'm
not
going
to
hold
up
these
evictions,
and
we
now
have
52
tenants
in
one
apartment
building
that
are
about
to
be
evicted
unless
we
can
find
a
way
to
prevent
that.
so
there's
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
because
of
the
bond.
that's
the
only
issue.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
we
can't
pose
the
bond
in
those
cases.
and
the
tenants
are
not
in
any
position
to
post
the
bond,
and
they're
likely
be
evicted
unless
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
what
they've
been
doing
in
those
cases
is
that
rent
is
all
paid
in
the
court
in
those
cases
but
we're
not
willing
to
turn
the
rent
over
to
the
landlord.
and
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
is
non
payment
of
rent.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
right.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
are
you
speaking
of
the
instant
case
or
the
one
which
is
just
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
in
the
sanks
case
that
defense
--
for
the
momman
case,
let's
start
with
that
which
is
the
housing
authority
case.
the
defense
is
the
one
to
which
i
just
eluded
that
the
housing
authority
has
no
right
to
evict
the
person
just
because
she's
having
a
visitors
from
the
opposite
race.
in
the
sanks
case,
our
contention
where
we
will
ever
able
to
present
it
would
be
that
there's
no
landlord-tenant
relationship
because
there's
apparently
a
common
law
marriage
between
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
in
that
case,
the
issues
that
i
just
mentioned;
that
is
a
very
complicated
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
in
the
present
posture,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
in
the
present
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
they
can't
start
on
the
justice,
the
peace
court,
so
we
can
never
even
get
into
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
if
they
post
the
bond
where
--
if
we
post
the
bond
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
relatively
--
it
has
been
rapid
in
our
case
at
least.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
it
was
rapid
in
our
case.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
usual
length
of
time
is.
but
it
was
very
rapid
in
our
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
believe
so
sir.
i
think
they
could.
that
seems
to
me
equity
in
fairness
and
that's
what
we've
been
trying
to
do
even
in
these
cases
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
that
is
a
correct
decision
of
what
they've
done.
we
protect
the
landlord's
interest.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
i
have
to
say
that.
i
think
that
is
and
maybe
in
inconsistencies,
but
it
just
rule
of
reasons.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
we'll
pass
to
the
next
question.
i
just
like
to
make
one
final
point.
the
state
continues
in
this
case
is
to
talk
about
the
landlord's
property
interest
and
how
we're
expropriating
in
that
one
point
of
brief,
the
state
says
a
tenant's
private
war
on
poverty.
i
think
it
should
be
emphasized
that
the
tenant
does
have
a
property
interest.
he
has
a
lease
hold
and
indeed
that
georgia
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
a
tenant's
leasehold
is
a
property
right
that
is
entitled
to
his
much
protection
as
the
landlord's
bright
in
his
property.
there
are
two
conflicting
property
rights
involved
here,
lease
hold
versus
fee
hold.
and
what
is
involved
is
just
the
issue
of
letting
a
court
make
the
determination
of
which
right
is
superior.
we
want
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
that's
what
the
case
is
all
about.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
in
this
case,
your
honors,
presented
to
the
court
over
a
year
ago
what
we
thought
was
a
narrow
question
of
due
process
involving
the
right
to
a
hearing.
when
we
presented
the
case
to
you
last
time,
we
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
snyder
case
that
the
deprivation
of
the
property--
of
the
rental
property
of
our
clients
was
unconstitutional.
since
the
snyder
case
and
since
we
last
made
that
argument,
this
court
has
given
further
encouragement
to
our
clients
and
to
us
on
the
same
issue
with
the
case
of
goldberg
v.
kelly
which
is,
again,
a
hearing
case
involving
due
process.
our
position
is
very
simple
that,
really,
we
don’t
ask
the
court
to
go
any
further
than
the
court
went
in
those
cases.
indeed,
we
take
the
position
that
the
case
before
you
is
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
the
cases
you
dealt
with--
than
the
two
cases
you
dealt
with
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’ll
be
happy
to
begin
with
that,
sir.
it
might
be
easier.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
appellees
have
suggested
to
you
that
there’s
a
possibility
of
mootness
and
they’ve
raised
two
points.
first
of
all,
they
point
out
that
they
believe
that
our
clients
may
have
moved
out
and,
indeed,
they
are
correct.
our
clients
have
moved
out.
and,
secondly,
they
present
the
existence
of
a
new
statute
enacted
in
georgia
earlier
this
year.
as
we
indicated
in
our
sup--
in
our
response
to
the
question,
there--
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
why
this
case
is
not
moot.
first
of
all,
the
fact
is
that,
as
to
our
clients,
the
specific
clients
in
this
case,
mrs.
sank
and
mrs.
momman,
even
though
they’ve
moved
out
they’re
still
subject
to
the
double
rent
provisions
of
61305.
so,
there
is
no
way
that
this
court--
if
this
court
should
hold
this
case
moot,
we
would
not
be
within
the
brockington
case
and
hall
v.
beals
that
this
case--
this
court
decided
last
year.
in
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
grant
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
sought
that
was
in
brockington,
i
believe,
where
there
was
a
question
of
a
man
running
for
congress
and,
in
the
other
case,
hall
v.
beals,
the
court
just
talked
about
the
1968
election
and
said,
“that’s
history.
it’s
all
over.”
well,
it
isn’t
history
what’s
happening
to
mrs.
sanks.
mrs.
sanks,
as
a
matter
as
the
same
proceeding
which
is
before
you
right
now,
will
be
held,
if
the
landlord
does
no
more
than
walk
into
court
in
the
same
judicial
proceeding
and
ask
for
double
damages,
will
be
held
liable
for
double
damages
for
the
total
amount
of
rent
that
he
claims
to
be
due.
so,
mrs.
sanks--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
we--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
there’d
been--
we’ve
been
in
three
courts.
we
began
in
the
civil
court
of
fulton
county
where
there
was
a
judicial
opinion,
and
that
was
in
favor
of
our
clients.
it
then
went
directly
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
that
was
an
adverse
decision
and,
now,
we’re
here.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
it
wasn’t
at
all.
indeed--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i’ll
be
happy
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
under
georgia
procedures
when
a
trial
judge
feels
that
the
question
is
of
such
importance
that
the
rest
of
the
case
continue
until
a
decision
is
had
on
the
earlier
issue,
he
may
put
the
case
forward
for
appeal
right
at
that
moment
and
that’s
what
happened
in
this
case
and,
in
judge
william’s
opinion
which
you’ll
find
in
the
appendix,
judge
william
specifically
found
that
the
matter
is
of
such
importance
that
immediate
appeal
should
be
had.
so,
we
went
as
far
as
the
procedures
that
that
court
would
permit
us
to
go
and
we
couldn’t
file
the
bond,
and
that’s
why
we
couldn’t
go
further
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
the
federal
question--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
that
question
is
not
open.
all
of
the
issues
involving
the
posting
of
bond
have
been
closed.
the
substantive
issues
have
not
been
litigated,
namely,
mrs.
momman’s
defense
to
the
eviction
and
mrs.
sanks’
defense,
but
the
issues
of
the
bond
have
all
been--
we’ve
gone
as
far
as
we
can
go
on
those.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
the
only
federal
question.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
they
may,
of
course,
in--
if
the
case
were
to
continue,
there
might
be
federal
questions
arising
out
of
the
substantive
matters
and,
indeed,
i
suspect
it
might
but
that’s
apparently
not--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
now,
sir,
we’re--
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
but
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
new
statute
became
effective
as
of
july
1
and
we
are
asserting
no
claims
and,
indeed,
that
statute,
we
contend
and
i
think
the
court
may
really
have
to
find
that,
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
these
proceedings.
the
dispossessory
warrant
that
we’re
dealing
with
was
taken
out
prior
to
july
1,
1970.
it
was
under
the
old
act,
and
our
contention
is
that
although
there
is
now
a
new
act,
and
i’m
happy
to
admit
to
the
court,
as
is
perfectly
obvious,
that
there
are
not
as
many
people
going
to
be
affected
by
the
act
for
which
we’re
talking
about
today
than
would
be
affected
by
the
new
act,
but--
and
so,
we’re
talking
about
a
relatively
small
group
of
people.
but,
we
are
here
today
under
the
old
act.
now,
it
is--
i
certainly
submit
to
the
court
and
i
think
i’m
being--
i’m
accurate
in
it,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
our
clients
and
potentially
other
clients,
indeed
the
clients
in
the
two
cases
that
are
now
pending
before
the
federal
district
court
and
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
at
least
those
two
groups
of
people
are
potentially
subject
to
double
damages
and,
in
this
piece
of
litigation,
i
think
that’s
important.
indeed,
in
looking
over
the
argument
last
time,
i
found
that
i
may
really
have
misled
the
court
because
i
suggested
that
a
second
lawsuit
might
have
to
be
filed
in
order
to
collect
these
damages.
i’ve
done
a
little
more
research
and
i
now
can
assure
you
that
that
isn’t
true.
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
if
you
should
hold
this
court--
this
case
moot,
for
example,
or
if
you
should
decide
for
the
appellee,
all
that
needs
to
happen
in
this
case
is
the
landlord
in
both
of
these
cases
goes
into
court
and
says
“i
now
want
a
judgment
amounting
to
double
the
amount
of
rent
that
has
been
paid
during
the
period
of
this
litigation.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir.
it’s
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
because,
sir,
i
would
presume
that
the
remedy
derives
out
of
the
action
as
it
was
filed
and
not
out
of
subsequent
changes
of
law.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’d--
i’m--
i
just--
it’s
an
area
of
the
law
that
i’m
not
familiar
with.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
it
certainly
isn’t
applicable
to
pending
actions
insofar
as--
that
now,
for
example,
there’s
no
question
of
having
to
post
a
bond
anymore.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
do
not.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
for
civil
actions,
in
general,
it’s
two
years.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there’s--
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
as
a
part
of
that--
of
the
eviction
law,
the
dispossessory
law.
i
take
it
that
the
court
is
suggesting
that
they’d--
obviously,
that
they--
that
a
lower
court
might
not
grant
the
double
damages
which
the
initial
lawsuit
permitted.
i
don’t
know
how
we
can
know
that
in
fact.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mrs.
momman
moved
out
about
a
month
ago,
but
she
was
there
until
that
time.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
other
lady
is
rather
hard
to
keep
track
of.
she
may
have
been
out
for
some
time,
but
she’s--
i’m
not
sure
how
long
she’s
been
out.
she
doesn’t
have
a
telephone
and
doesn’t
respond
to
our
communication
so
i’m
not
too
sure
about
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
just
didn’t
look
that
up.
i
obviously
should’ve,
but
i
didn’t.
as
a
general
rule
though,
on
these
eviction
cases,
i
can
say
that
the
courts
have
held
that
the
fact,
for
example,
that
the
tenant
moves
out
is
not
enough
to
free
him
from
the
double
damages
provision,
and
that’s
what
happened
here
and
i
would
suspect
that
the
courts
would
bring
that
into
play
if
faced
with
the
question
that
you’ve
raised,
that
is,
that
that
real
thing
that
may
have
made--
the
action
that
may
have
made
this
case
moot
is
the
fact
that
the
tenant
moved
out
and,
that,
the
courts
have
said
is
not
enough
to
prevent
double
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes.
i
think
the
case
is
moot
in
this
sense.
let
me
just
give
you
this
resonation.
the
case
is
moot
in
this
sense,
a
very
technical
narrow
sense
that
mrs.
sanks
and
mrs.
momman
have
nothing
to
stand--
stand
to
gain
or
lose
nothing
by
this
litigation.
in
a
narrow
reading
on
the
concept
of
mootness,
i
think
the
case
will
be
moot.
in
a
broader
reading
on
the
concept
of
mootness,
i
might
point
out,
as
we
have
in
our
brief,
that
you
have
the
meltzer
case
on
the
court’s
docket
right
now
which
raises
the
identical
issue.
you
have
wise
and
williams
which
are
the
two
cases
in
the
ju--
in
the
northern
district.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
i’m
not--
in
recovering
from
my
surprise
in
having
this
issue
raised--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
justice
white,
you
have
thought
of
an
aspect
in
this
case
that
i
never
thought
of.
that’s--that
is
what
my
surprise
comes
from.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
meaning,
that
the
remedies
continue
on,
i
take
it.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
there
isn’t
a
bondsman
because
we
never
put
up
the
bond
in
this
case.
so
that--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
how
we
got
here.
it’s
by
refusing
to
put
up
the
bond.
well,
i’ll
just
go
on
because
i--
let
me
just
finish
why
i
think
it’s--
aside
from
your
point
mr.
justice
white,
assuming
that
we’re
out
of
court
on
that
point,
let
me
just
continue
with
the
other
arguments.
there
seem
to
be
three
reasons
why
we
still
are
in
court,
unless
there’s
no
saving
statute.
one
is
that
those
ladies
are
subject
to
double
damages.
the
second
is
the
question
of
the
whole
statutory
scheme
involved
in
here,
both
303
and
305.
even
if
there’s
a
problem
with
303
and
i
think
in
being
honest
with
the
court,
i
must
say
that
there
is
a
problem
about
mootness
in
this
case
about
303.
that
is
the
posting
of
the
bond.
that’s
the
provision
that
relates
to
the
posting
of
the
bond,
and
there’s
no
way
that
i
can
figure
out
that
303
has
any
direct
consequences
on
our
clients
and
i
think
there’s
a
serious
problem
with
mootness,
narrowly
seen
in
this
case
on
303.
the
final
point
i
think
should
be
made
on
mootness
is
this
court’s
often
expressed
view
that
when
there’s
a
case
that
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review,
mootness
should
not
be
read
narrowly
but
should
be
read
in
a
larger
sense.
and,
i
think
in
this
case
that
would
be
the
problem
because
of
the
many
other
cases
you
have
that
will
deal
with
the
same
issue.
indeed,
there’s
another
case
in
oregon
that’s
going
to
come
up.
as
you
may
know,
there’s
a
main,
i
believe
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
a
main
case
on
a
very
similar
issue.
this
really
is
a
case
that
the
court,
i
suspect,
will
be
asked
to
deal
with
on
a
number
of
other
occasions.
i’m
just--
unless
the
court
has
any
further
question,
i’ll
close
on
mootness
right
there.
i
see
the
court
is
very
troubled
by
this
and
by
tomorrow,
when
we
finish
this
argument,
i
certainly
will
have
an
answer
for
you
about
the
saving
statute.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
just
take
a
few
minutes
and
talk
about
the
substantive
issue.
we,
in
our
brief,
talked
a
lot
about
equal
protection.
one
of
the
good
things
about
the
fact
of
coming
to
the
supreme
court
is
you
have
a
long
time
to
think
about
your
cases
and
chew
them
up
for
a
long
time.
the
more
i
think
about
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
less
excited
i
am
by
it,
and
the
more
i
think
about
the
due
process
argument,
the
more
excited
i
am
by
it.
i
come
here
today
not
asking
you
to
decide
this
case
on
equal
protection
grounds.
i
think,
in
many
dissents
before
this
court
and
in
many
majority
opinions
of
this
court,
misgivings
have
been
expressed
about
equal
protection
which
suggest
that
equal
protection
is
the
doctrine
that
ought
to
be
carefully
dealt
with,
i
think,
and
i
don’t
think
we
need
to
ask
the
court
to
go
as
far
as
equal
protection
with
its
notions
of
compelling
state
interest
and
its
notions
of
more
complicated
adjudication
of
constitutional
issues.
we’re
talking
about
a
very
narrow
little
question,
and
that
is
the
right
to
get
into
court
and
where,
it
seems
to
me,
we’re
right
within
snyder
and
we’re
right
within
goldberg.
let
me
finish
today’s
presentation
by
suggesting
just
two
ways
in
which
i
think
we’re
even
a
narrow--
we
present
a
narrower
question
to
you
than
was
presented
in
snyder
and
goldberg.
in
the
snyder
case,
for
example,
there’s
no
finding
of
indigency.
indeed,
there’s
a
specific
question
raised
as
to
whether
mrs.
snyder
is
indigent.
we’re
indigent.
it’s
clear
in
the
record
that
we
have
a
finding
of
indigency.
so,
you’re
dealing
with
more--
an
easier
problem
from
that
sense.
finally--
and,
secondly,
in
both
snyder
and
goldberg,
the
deprivation
that’s
talked
about
is
only
a
temporary
deprivation
of
the
use
of
property
and
that
was
pointed
out
in,
i
believe,
a
dissent
in
that
case
very
clearly
that
the
use
of
the
property
is
what
was
involved.
in
our
case,
once
they’re
out,
they’re
out.
that’s
it.
that’s
a
final
deprivation
of
the
property.
in
that
case
too--
our
case
is--
for
that
reason--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
what
i’m
talking
about
is
the
general
statutory
scheme
and
comparing
it
to
snyder
where
somebody
is
only
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
wages
but
where
an
eviction
is
carried
out
in
georgia,
it
is
a
final
eviction.
there’s
no
way
to
get
back.
i’m
suggesting
that
this
is
a
more
severe
punishment
than
the
court
faced
in
snyder.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
it’s
also--
there’s
a
very
interesting
discussion
in
the
goldberg
case
about
the
consequences
of
welfare
and
why
welfare
is
a
right,
and
one
of
the
points
the
court
makes
in
that
case
is
that
welfare
guards
against
societal
molest
and
that
it
really
is
a
useful
thing.
it
helps
the
pursuit
of
happiness
to
have
welfare.
i
might
say
that,
it
seems
to
me
again,
that
we’re
an
easier
case
here
because
not
only
does
staying
in
your
house
guards
against
societal
molest,
but
the
kind
of
evictions
which
are
carried
forth
really
provokes
societal
molest.
one
of
the
things--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
i
take
it
that
it
means--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
societal
molest
is
a
phrase
that
the--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
court
uses
in
the
goldberg
case
and
it
says
“we
want
to
guard
against
that.”
what
i
think
happens
in
eviction
cases
is
people
get
put
out
on
the
street,
instead
of,
as
in
welfare
cases
as
sort
of
administrative
determination
being
made
in
some
downtown
office.
in
eviction
cases,
people
are
put
right
out
on
the
street
in
poor
neighborhoods.
that,
i
think,
is
a
major
creator
of
societal
molest.
those
are
the
distinctions
that
i
think
exists
or
the
reasons
i
think
this
case
is
easier
than
the
goldberg
and
the
snyder
cases,
and
i
will
rest.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
just
respond
to
justice
white’s
question
of
yesterday.
we
have
done
--
have
researched
and
we
have
found
what
i
suspect
some
members
of
the
court
may
already
have
known
there
is
in
fact
a
savings
statute
in
georgia.
there
is
indeed
a
constitutional
provision
that
says
that
law
shall
not
have
retroactive
effect.
the
--
upon
my
quote
from
the
typical
case
and
there
are
number
of
cases
that
make
very
clear
that
in
our
case
the
--
mrs.
sanks
and
mrs.
momman
will
be
subjected
double
damages.
but
a
typical
case
language
and
the
typical
case
says,
law
as
proscribe
for
the
future
unless
a
statute
either
expressly
or
by
necessary
implication,
that’s
language
that
used
throughout
the
cases,
shows
that
the
general
assembly
intended
that
it
operate
retroactively
it
will
be
given
only
prospective
applications.
particularly,
relevant
case
in
this
context
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sorry.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that
is
anthony
v.
penn,
212
georgia
292.
the
statutory
provision
is
the
constitution
which
is
part
of
the
georgia
code
and
as
cited
this
georgia
code
annotated
2-302.
the
statutory
provision
that
says
laws
proscribe
only
for
the
future.
they
cannot
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
nor
usually
have
a
retrospective
application
is
georgia
code
annotated
102-104.
the
closest
case
we
were
able
to
find
for
this
--
on
this
issue
is
the
case
of
leathers
v.
turner
75
georgia
appeals
62,
that’s
a
1947
case
and
it
involved
the
new
nil
that
was
enacted
in
georgia
at
that
time
and
the
debtor
in
that
case
was
attempting
to
have
his
rights
determine
under
the
old
act
and
the
court
said
that
only
--
and
the
creditor
was
asserting
that
his
rights
would
appear
under
the
new
act
and
the
court
decided
for
the
debtor
and
said,
only
when
there
is
very
express
language
in
the
new
statute
that
says
that
the
rights
created
under
the
new
statue
replaced
the
rights
under
the
old
act
only
with
such
express
language
does
the
new
act
apply
and
there
is
no
express
language
in
this
case
in
the
new
georgia
statute,
the
rights
of
the
debtor
--
of
mrs.
sanks
will
be
determined
by
the
old
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that
case
is
page
62,
75
georgia
appeals
62,
it’s
a
1947
case.
i
might
say
in
further
reference
to
mootness
since
i
know
how
much
that
concerns
the
court
that
that
raises
a
very
interesting
side
issue
that
again
i
haven’t
thought
of
and
your
question
stimulated
our
thinking
about
that.
if
305
is
clearly
applicable
in
this
case
and
i
think
i
feel
it
was
persuaded
that
it
is.
the
305
is
clearly
applicable,
it’s
very
interesting
what
happened,
should
this
court
decide
that
305
is
constitutional.
if
you
decide
the
305
is
constitutional
or
let’s
just
present
that,
the
case
goes
back
down
presumably
because
the
substance
of
issues
haven’t
been
raised
yet
and
at
that
point
under
305,
the
landlord
will
be
entitled
to
a
double
rent
judgment.
the
only
way
the
tenant
will
be
able
to
do
anything
about
the
double
rent
judgment
is
if
she
goes
in
under
303
assuming
that
you
will
not
decide
303
or
decide
adversely
or
she
will
have
to
go
in
under
303
and
post
the
double-rent
bond.
when
i
talked
yesterday,
i
was
fairly
certain
that
303
was
not
applicable
in
this
case,
i
think
that’s
been
kind
of
opened
up
by
your
questionings.
so,
i
think
the
303,
if
you
hold
305
constitutional,
we’re
going
to
be
stuck
with
303
as
well
and
i
think
the
point
that
makes
is
that
what
you’re
faced
with
and
what
we’ve
dealing
with
is
the
whole
statutory
scheme
of
303
and
305.
and
i
think
they
really
can’t
be
separated,
one
must
be
understood
even
in
this
narrow
case
is
this,
they
must
be
understood
together.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
conclude
the
cases.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
as
i
understand,
georgia
procedure
sir,
all
the
landlord
has
to
do
is
go
in
to
court
after
your
decision
and
ask
for
judgment
just
literally
walk
into
the
court
and
ask
for
judgment.
now,
if
we
and
we
will
not
be
able
to
assert
affirmative
defenses
without
filing
the
above.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
there
are
two
landlords
in
this
specific
case,
there’s
the
atlanta
housing
authority
and
then
there
is
mr.
sanks.
and
the
atlanta
housing
authority
is
not
a
vindictive
agency.
i
suspect
that
there’s
every
possibility
that
mr.
sanks
is.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
sir,
i
just
don’t
know.
i
understand
that
mr.
sanks
is
now
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
before.
i
just
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
because
there
is
no
procedure
at
the
present
time
for
filing
a
lawsuit
under
the
old
statute.
i
think
now
they
have
to
file
a
lawsuit
under
the
new
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i
suspect,
it
seems
to
me
that
logical
answer
is
that
the
case
was
filed
before
this
new
statute
took
effect
and
that’s
time
at
which
he
demanded
the
landlord
sought
to
have
his
rights
vindicate.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
that
we’re
swimming
in
a
dark
tunnel
as
related
to
the
question
that
you
just
post
sir,
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
a
lawsuit
were
filed
now.
but
i
think
the
georgia
law
is
quite
clear
on
the
laws
that
--
a
statute
--
a
lawsuit
that
was
filed
previous
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
has
not.
but
there
couldn’t
have
been
yet,
could
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
case
is
we’ve
been
able
to
find
require
very
specific
language
saying
that
it’s
a
bar
in
the
new
statute
and
there
is
no
such
language.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
am.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
they
were
ceremoniously
married
and
i
believe
some
time
ago,
40’s
i
believe.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
in
the
40’s.
mr.
sanks
then
attempt
to
do
evict
mrs.
sanks
from
the
premises
and
that’s
why
this
is
a
somewhat
confuse
kind
of
a
landlord
tenant
case
to
bring
to
this
court.
but
they
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
they’re
not
living
together
at
this
point
because
she
is
now
out
of
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
at
point
have
gone
i
might
say.
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’ll
be
delighted
to.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
just
like
to
add
one
comment
to
justice
white’s
question.
i
don’t
think
303
that
bond
posting
requirements
is
out
of
case
at
all
because
if
this
court
holds
305
constitutional,
the
only
way
we
can
litigate
the
substantive
issues
as
i
understand
what’s
going
on
is
to
post
the
bond
required
under
303.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
is
no
other
way
to
go
into
court
if
305
is
constitutional.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
that’s
the
statutory
intention,
i
think
that
was
the
intention
but
this
case
as
mr.
evans
points
out
the
procedures
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutorily
constructed
procedures.
we’re
in
a
kind
of
never,
never
land,
a
dark
tunnel
as
you
say,
a
procedure
and
what’s
happened
here
is
if
this
court
holds
305
constitutional
mrs.
momman
and
mrs.
sanks
will
be
liable
for
double
damages.
and
the
issue,
the
substantive
issues
will
never
have
been
litigated
such
as
the
question
you
raised
about
or
justice
blackmun
raised
about
whether
or
not
you
can
sue
a
husband
and
wife
can
sue
one
another.
all
the
substantive
defenses
that
mrs.
sanks
might
want
to
make
will
–
she’ll
have
to
post
the
double
bond
to
make
those
defenses
and
therefore
303
is
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir
she
has
been
sued
for
double
damages.
you
see
it’s
only
one
procedure,
the
procedure
that
was
began
and
led
to
this
case
is
a
procedure
for
possession
and
double
damages.
so,
she
is
liable
for
double
damages
and
the
only
way
she
can
make
a
defense
against
that
in
the
event
that
305
is
left
standing
is
go
in
and
post
the
double
bond.
obviously,
we
don’t
know
what
the
lower
courts
of
georgia
are
going
to
do.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
true
sir,
but
she
still
subject
to
double
damages
and
the
only
way
that
she
can
get
in
and
defend
on
the
merits
which
she
wouldn’t
do
on
possession
she
is
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
we
don’t
know
what
the
other
side
is
going
to
claim.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
i
think
there
is
sir
--
a
lawsuit
between
them.
i
think
this
suit
is
of
the
lawsuit
between
them
on
the
question
of
double
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
is
there
is
--
we
have
cases
in
the
brief
to
that
effect
that
they
said
very
clearly
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed.
the
georgia
supreme
court
says
very
clearly
that
all
they
need
to
do,
the
mere
fact
for
example
that
a
tenant
vacates
is
not
enough
voluntarily.
it’s
not
enough
to
relief
him
of
double
damages.
that
can’t
get
him
out
of
the
double
damages
and
all
they
need
to
do
is
get
a
judgment
from
the
dispossessory
suit
filed
under
303.
the
landlord
can
take
a
judgment
for
double
damages
as
well
as
possession.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir,
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
great
impact
and
i
might
say
that
as
you
pointed
out
when
we
spoke,
when
we
appeared
before
that
the
georgia
court
has
been
serving
as
a
court
of
equity
and
really
ignoring
the
statute.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
court
just
felt
and
many
judges
in
georgia
feel
that
the
statute
is
so
inequitable.
there
must
be
a
way
to
get
around
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
only
atypical
and
that
somebody
finally
snuck
away
in
to
let
us
get
into
court
and
that’s
what
many
people
have
been
trying
to
do
for
many
years,
is
to
get
into
the
court
and
nobody
could
ever
do
it
before
and
the
judges
said
finally
the
heck
with
it,
we’re
going
to
find
a
way
to
get
them
in
the
court.
the
problem
is
not
an
atypical
problem.
the
solution
can
thrive
with
an
atypical
solution.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
in
the
sanks
case
is
quite
different
than
the
issue
in
the
previous
case.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
today
is
whether
the
state
of
georgia
may
constitutionally
create
a
judicial
procedure
which
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
discriminates
against
all
tenants
and
in
favor
of
all
property
owners
in
the
state.
the
issue
is
thus
whether
a
state
can
divide
all
of
its
citizens
into
these
two
categories
and
discriminate
in
the
manner
presented
in
the
statute.
the
operation
of
the
statute
has
been
extensively
set
out
in
the
materials
before
the
court.
i
might
also
say
that
it
has
been
considered
before,
thus
this
statute
has
been
considered
before
in
the
case
of
williams
v.
shaffer.
as
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
a
statute
under
which
landlords
and
big
tenants
by
going
to
the
marshal
of
the
court
taking
out
a
bond
which
they
want,
which
cost
$6.00
and
without
any
further
proceeding
or
whatsoever,
tenants
are
evicted
from
their
premises.
the
only
way
a
tenant
can
arrest
these
proceedings
is
by
filing
with
the
court
a
counter-affidavit
and
with
that,
an
amount
of
bond
which
the
statute
doesn't
even
stipulate
to
guarantee
that
the
landlord
will
not
lose
either
his
money
or
double
his
money
at
the
final
determination
of
the
issue.
the
question
these
statutes,
these
statutory
provisions
present
first
go
to
the
heart
of
the
notion
of
due
process.
for
the
georgia
statute
permits
landlords
to
assert
rights
in
a
way
that's
completely
different
from
the
rights
the
tenants
have.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
this
statute
affects
all
landlords
and
all
tenants.
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
individual
or
corporate.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
tenant
has
a
valid
claim
or
has
no
claim
or
whatsoever.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
tenant
is
scrupulous
and
totally
disrupted.
everybody
is
affected
by
this
statute.
this
court
has
previously
dealt
with
an
issue
which
we
feel
is
directly
on
point
in
the
sniadach
case.
the
sniadach
case
which
was
a
due
process
case
like
this
one
involved
the
taking
of
property
of
a
person
before
there
was
any
court
hearing.
and
that's
the
crucial
question:
may
a
statute
take
away
somebody's
property
without
a
court
hearing?
in
sniadach,
the
court
held
that
it
could
not
do
so.
and
in
many
ways,
this
case
is
even
a
better
case
than
the
sniadach
case.
we
feel
we're
completely
within
that
case.
the
court
need
break
no,
no
ground
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
tenants
in
the
sanks
case.
we
have
a
much
narrower
case
than
theirs.
for
example
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
sniadach
case,
their,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
the
action
taken
--
that
led
to
the
case
being
brought
in
was
a
final
disposition
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
of
that.
it's
very
clear
that
once
the
tenant
is
out,
that's
a
final
disposition
of
that
matter.
there
was
also
a
question
in
the
sniadach
case
that
whether
the
matter
involve
was
de
minimis,
that
question
was
raised.
there's
no
question
about
this
case
being
de
minimis.
again,
the
tenant
is
out
on
the
street.
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
there
was
also
a
question
in
that
case
is
whether
the
tenant
had
--
whether
the
parties
to
that
case
had
demonstrated
poverty
and
whether
they
were
actually
going
to
be
affected
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
here,
there's
a
specific
judicial
finding
in
the
lower
court
opinion
of
indigency
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
tenants
to
obtain
the
bond.
they
will
be
affected
by
the
statute
indeed.
they
would
be
affected
where
the
action
of
the
court
not
held
up
by
these
proceedings.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
the
fury
of
the
statute
is
that
only
one
tenant
is
holding
over.
may
the
--
may
a
landlord
go
into
court
under
this
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
in
fact,
under
any
conditions
or
no
conditions
where
the
landlord
can't
go
into
court
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
right.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
he
has
to
make
a
statement
under
oath
that
the
tenant
is
either
holding
over
or
always
--
i
believe
it's
that
he
owes
money
to
the
landlord.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
holding
over
beyond
the
term
of
his
lease
hold.
and
as
judge
williams
pointed
out
in
the
lower
court,
the
tenants
in
this
case
are
tenants
at
will
and
indeed,
that's
a
good
illustration
of
the
problem
with
the
statute.
the
tenants
or
tenants
at
will,
therefore
under
the
law,
they're
entitled
to
a
60-day
notice
to
vacate
and
theoretically,
the
landlord
can't
do
anything
against
them,
can't
take
any
action
to
evict
them
until
he
is
given
on
the
60-day
notice.
but
it
doesn't
work
that
way
and
what
happens
is
the
landlord
can
go
in
under
any
conditions.
now,
as
you
point
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
certainly
would
be
possible
for
a
tenant
later
on
to
bring
an
action
for
false
eviction
and
indeed,
georgia
supreme
court
makes
the
same
suggestion.
but
that
doesn't
do
a
tenant
any
good
once
he
has
been
evicted.
again,
as
you
point
out
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
not
money.
the
issue
involved
is
possession
and
that's
what
the
statute's
all
about.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
1827
and
has
been
periodically
modified
since
then.
but
nothing
in
substance
is
really
changed
since
1827.
it's
a
curious
and
acronism.
they're
just
is
in
the
statute
in
the
country
in
which
tenants
are
subjected
to
such
a
rigorous
and
immediate
eviction
and
landlords
are
given
such
gracious
privileges
as
the
georgia
eviction
statute
it.
indeed
in
thinking
about
asking
other
people
to
be
submit
amicus
brief
in
the
case,
we
couldn't
think
of
going
any
place
else
because
nobody
else
has
a
statute
like
this.
we're
just
unique
in
georgia
in
having
the
statute.
i
think
it's
important
when
talking
about
due
process
in
the
sniadach
case
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
feel
that
sniadach
was
an
aberration
in
the
court's
thinking.
sniadach
was
in
complete
context
with
what
the
court's
been
doing
for
a
long
time.
indeed
in
hovy
v.
eliot
again,
which
was
70
years
ago,
the
court
there
also
took
the
position
that
not
only
notice
was
necessary
in
order
for
a
due
process,
but
also
an
opportunity
to
heard.
the
usual
requisites
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
the
sniadach
case,
the
usual
requisites
of
due
process
are
noticed
in
the
prior
hearing.
indeed,
there
are
some
wonderful
languages
in
the
hovy
case
where
the
court
really
get
quite
upset
about
the
procedure
in
that
case
which
did
not
afford
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
said
that
a
judgment
issue
done
in
those
conditions
wants
all
the
attributes
of
the
judicial
determination.
it
is
judicial
user
patient
and
oppression
and
can
never
be
upheld
where
justice
is
justly
administered.
this
case
we
feel
is
quite
like.
there
has
been
notice
but
there
is
no
opportunity
to
be
heard
unless
the
tenant
presents
a
bond
which
in
our
case
certainly,
our
tenants
are
never
able
to
present
to
a
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
we
do
in
our
cases.
we've
sort
of
invented
a
procedure
in
these
cases.
we
have
applied
to
the
courts
for
rules
“nisi”
as
it's
called
in
georgia
and
we
do
pay
our
rent
in
the
court.
indeed
in
this
case,
in
the
moment
case
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
we
haven't
had
a
case
such
as
the
latter
one
but
we
do
have
cases
where
the
rent
is
in
contest.
indeed
everyday,
we
always
pay
the
rent
in
the
court.
and
as
the
georgia
supreme
court,
when
this
was
argued
before
them
said
“how
can
you
do
that?
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
that.”
and
indeed,
they're
right.
but
the
lower
court
have
taken
the
position
that
that's
fair
and
reasonable
that
the
contested
matter
be
put
into
the
court
and
then
will
decide
who
gets
it
at
the
end.
so,
we've
always
paid
our
rent
in
the
court
and
it's
being
paid
in
at
the
moment
case
which
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
sir,
it's
not
-
actually,
we're
not
before
an
equity
court,
we're
before
a
civil
court
which
has
no
equity
jurisdiction.
it's
just
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
separate
equity
court
which
also
has
other
powers,
but
a
separate
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
they
have
something
like
that
in
mind.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
it's
--
the
way
its
work
is
a
judge
is
just
issued
an
order,
so
stating
and
saying
the
parties
will
pick
--
that's
the
only
conditions
under
which
the
judge
is
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
foregoing
the
bond,
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
yes
sir,
but
even
since
then,
it's
been
operating
this
way.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
nothing's
going
on
with
the
supreme
court.
it
may
be
improper
to
say
so
but
many
people
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
statute
and
have
been
giving
us
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
that
question.
and
so,
we've
been
allowed
to
bring
cases
in
the
lower
court.
and
the
judge
is
always
kind
of
just
looked
down
and
says
“well,
i
shouldn't
be
doing
this,
but
i'm
going
to
let
you
file
it
anyway.”
that's
a
bit
the
way
it's
worth.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
but
we
have
excellent
lower
court
judge
that
support
the
county.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
you
could
tell
us
that
you
would
make
a
major
edition
to
georgia
jurisprudence
because
nobody
has
any
idea
whatsoever.
the
statutory
language
is
double
the
rent
reserve
to
stipulate
it
to
be
paid.
that
doesn't
say
that
was
owing
at
the
time.
it
doesn't
say
that
might
be
owing
later
and
indeed
as
the
briefs
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
one
court
interprets
it
in
that
way
and
did
the
fulton
county
civil
courts
until
we
begun
to
present
these
cases.
the
fulton
county
civil
court
interpreted
that
to
mean,
future
double
rent.
and
as
far
as
i
know
where
for
legal
aid
society
is
not
council
in
the
cases,
they
may
still
do
so.
they
take
a
year's
rent
because
the
clerk
has
just
decided
that
six
months
is
the
amount
of
time
that
this
case
may
last
and
then
therefore,
they
double
that
and
they
require
every
tenant
to
pay
a
year's
rent.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
it's
the
bond.
it's
a
fact
that
all
tenants
must
pay.
the
law
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
could
be.
well
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
not
if
you're
an
indigent.
in
this
case,
there
not
is,
but
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
which
we
claim
to
be,
and
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
is
a
finding.
yes
sir.
judge
williams's
opinion
on
page
38
of
the
appendix,
there's
a
specific
finding
of
indigency.
the
issue
that
we
present
to
the
court
is
the
due
process
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
case,
there's
so
many
different
ways
we
can
go.
the
statute
is
wrong
for
so
many
reasons.
there
so
many
defects
in
the
statute.
but
--
just
--
in
order
to
present
the
simplest
issue,
i
present
to
the
court
the
due
process
issue
which
is
just
obviously
wrong
on
other
cases,
on
common
sense,
on
decency
and
on
the
law.
we
could
also
argue
the
equal
protection
cases.
we
feel
it's
a
clear
violation
of
equal
protection
between
landlords
and
between
tenants.
i
could
get
into
the
question
of
equal
protection
between
rich
people
and
poor
people
but
i
don't
even
think
we
ever
need
to
reach
that
issue
because
the
statute
violates
equal
protection
simply
by
landlords
and
tenants.
that
your
honors
is
the
essence
of
our
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
court
there
list
two
very
specific
situations
when
we
could
go
into
equity.
where
there
is
no
landlord-tenant
relationship,
i
believe
is
one
of
them,
if
the
relationship
of
landlord
and
tenant
does
not
exist
and
the
acumen
is
unable
to
post
bond,
and
the
second
one,
if
the
landlord
had
tempted
to
oust
the
tenant
who
is
complaining
with
the
terms
of
his
lease.
but
the
equity
courts
don't
want
these
cases
and
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
into
equity
court
because
there
is
the
separation
of
jurisdiction.
landlord-tenant
cases
are
civil
court
cases.
at
least
in
fulton
county,
everybody
recognizes
that
and
acts
accordingly.
the
superior
court
which
is
out
court
of
equity
doesn't
wish
to
have
these
cases
and
always
says,
“go
find
your
remedy
in
civil
court,
that's
where
you
belong."
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
one
of
the
other
problems.
i
should
also
say
that
unlike
connecticut,
i
was
not
too
clear
of
the
connecticut
situation.
in
georgia,
the
bond
is
not
waived
for
both.
there
is
a
georgia
supreme
court
opinion
that
says
you
can't
waive
the
bond.
and
again,
the
lower
court
judges
who
just
sort
of
been
clearing
their
throats
and
looking
in
a
different
direction
and
allowing
landlords
to
waive
the
bond
when
they
wish
to
come
in.
but
as
a
general
rule,
there's
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
sir,
my
certainty
of
what
the
georgia
legislature
will
do,
i
would
like
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
i
think
i
was
substituting
hope
for
a
certainty.
i'd
certainly
hope
that
we
will
have
a
better
law
than
this.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
touch
on
several
things
mr.
evans
dealt
with.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
asked
the
question
about
the
common
law
issue.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
think
that's
been
too
clearly
presented.
in
fact,
the
common
law
that
the
landlord
did
not
have
the
right
of
common
law
just
to
evict
the
tenant
who
was
overdue
on
his
rent.
the
payment
of
rent
is
a
covenant,
which
required
the
landlord
to
go
into
court.
and
the
only
way
that
the
landlord
could
use
self
help
is
if
the
tenants
he
had
come
to
an
end,
but
that
was
not
because
the
rent
wasn't
paid.
so,
this
is
not
an
improvement
on
common
law
as
the
state
has
represented.
indeed
on
the
contrary,
it's
a
much
worst
condition
than
common
law.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir,
bur
we're
talking
about
is
our
right
to
present
defenses
in
court.
indeed,
one
of
the
cases
here
really
illustrates
the
badness
of
the
statute
of
the
momman
case
which
is
one
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
present
the
defense
on.
and
in
that
case,
what
have
happened
was
this
is
a
tenant
at
the
atlanta
housing
authority
and
mrs.
momman
is
a
white
woman
and
a
number
of
people
have
objected
to
the
fact
that
she
was
having
black
visitors
to
her
house,
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
project
manager
decided
to
evict
her
and
we
were
going
to
fight
that
in
court.
now
that
issue
obviously
is
not
for
this
court
and
it's
not
for
any
court
because
we
wanted
to
bring
it
the
court
and
that's
what
brought
mrs.
momman
into
that
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
files
an
affidavit
with
a
double
bond
and
mrs.
momman
is
a
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
we're
complaining
about
the
entire
procedure
sir.
that
we
could
not
get
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
appear
unless
he
files
a
double
bond.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
you're
asking,
i
take
it
as
if
there
were
no
bond
would
we
object
to
--
i
think
it
would
be
all
right,
then
if
there
was
no
bond
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
what
keeps
at
out
of
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
statute.
i
really
can't
comment
at
all.
what
i
was
referring
to
when
i
talked
about
statute
is
i
knew
that
some
statute
passed
the
state
senate.
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
mr.
evan's
is
referring
to.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
bill
is
passed
at
the
state
senate.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
bill,
but
i
knew
of
nothing
that
it
passed
the
house
of
representatives.
i'd
also
like
to
clear
up
but
i'm
afraid
it
might
be
a
misleading
impression
that
i
gave
about
the
georgia
legislature
and
also
about
the
courts
in
georgia.
i
didn't
mean
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
we
have
a
sort
of
happy
situation
down
there
where
everybody
agrees
and
everybody
can
do
what
they
want
even
though
the
law
says
the
opposite.
the
legislature
of
this
court
should
hold
the
statute
constitutional,
i
would
presume
there's
no
possibility
that
the
legislature
is
going
to
change
the
present
law,
and
as
far
as
the
courts
operating
in
our
benefit
in
the
kind
of
casual
way
that
i
talked
about
before,
the
court
should
doing
that
in
fulton
county
to
a
certain
extent.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they're
doing
it
nowhere
else.
and
indeed,
it
is
now
come
to
an
end
in
fulton
county
because
only
last
friday,
one
of
the
judges
in
the
civil
court
said
no
more,
i
am
not
waiting
anymore.
i'm
not
going
to
hold
up
these
evictions,
and
we
now
have
52
tenants
in
one
apartment
building
that
are
about
to
be
evicted
unless
we
can
find
a
way
to
prevent
that.
so
there's
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
because
of
the
bond.
that's
the
only
issue.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir.
we
can't
pose
the
bond
in
those
cases.
and
the
tenants
are
not
in
any
position
to
post
the
bond,
and
they're
likely
be
evicted
unless
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no
sir.
what
they've
been
doing
in
those
cases
is
that
rent
is
all
paid
in
the
court
in
those
cases
but
we're
not
willing
to
turn
the
rent
over
to
the
landlord.
and
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
is
non
payment
of
rent.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
right.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
are
you
speaking
of
the
instant
case
or
the
one
which
is
just
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
in
the
sanks
case
that
defense
--
for
the
momman
case,
let's
start
with
that
which
is
the
housing
authority
case.
the
defense
is
the
one
to
which
i
just
eluded
that
the
housing
authority
has
no
right
to
evict
the
person
just
because
she's
having
a
visitors
from
the
opposite
race.
in
the
sanks
case,
our
contention
where
we
will
ever
able
to
present
it
would
be
that
there's
no
landlord-tenant
relationship
because
there's
apparently
a
common
law
marriage
between
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
in
that
case,
the
issues
that
i
just
mentioned;
that
is
a
very
complicated
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
in
the
present
posture,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
in
the
present
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
they
can't
start
on
the
justice,
the
peace
court,
so
we
can
never
even
get
into
court.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
if
they
post
the
bond
where
--
if
we
post
the
bond
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that's
relatively
--
it
has
been
rapid
in
our
case
at
least.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
it
was
rapid
in
our
case.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
usual
length
of
time
is.
but
it
was
very
rapid
in
our
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
believe
so
sir.
i
think
they
could.
that
seems
to
me
equity
in
fairness
and
that's
what
we've
been
trying
to
do
even
in
these
cases
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
that
is
a
correct
decision
of
what
they've
done.
we
protect
the
landlord's
interest.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
i
have
to
say
that.
i
think
that
is
and
maybe
in
inconsistencies,
but
it
just
rule
of
reasons.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
we'll
pass
to
the
next
question.
i
just
like
to
make
one
final
point.
the
state
continues
in
this
case
is
to
talk
about
the
landlord's
property
interest
and
how
we're
expropriating
in
that
one
point
of
brief,
the
state
says
a
tenant's
private
war
on
poverty.
i
think
it
should
be
emphasized
that
the
tenant
does
have
a
property
interest.
he
has
a
lease
hold
and
indeed
that
georgia
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
a
tenant's
leasehold
is
a
property
right
that
is
entitled
to
his
much
protection
as
the
landlord's
bright
in
his
property.
there
are
two
conflicting
property
rights
involved
here,
lease
hold
versus
fee
hold.
and
what
is
involved
is
just
the
issue
of
letting
a
court
make
the
determination
of
which
right
is
superior.
we
want
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
that's
what
the
case
is
all
about.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
in
this
case,
your
honors,
presented
to
the
court
over
a
year
ago
what
we
thought
was
a
narrow
question
of
due
process
involving
the
right
to
a
hearing.
when
we
presented
the
case
to
you
last
time,
we
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
snyder
case
that
the
deprivation
of
the
property--
of
the
rental
property
of
our
clients
was
unconstitutional.
since
the
snyder
case
and
since
we
last
made
that
argument,
this
court
has
given
further
encouragement
to
our
clients
and
to
us
on
the
same
issue
with
the
case
of
goldberg
v.
kelly
which
is,
again,
a
hearing
case
involving
due
process.
our
position
is
very
simple
that,
really,
we
don’t
ask
the
court
to
go
any
further
than
the
court
went
in
those
cases.
indeed,
we
take
the
position
that
the
case
before
you
is
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
the
cases
you
dealt
with--
than
the
two
cases
you
dealt
with
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’ll
be
happy
to
begin
with
that,
sir.
it
might
be
easier.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
appellees
have
suggested
to
you
that
there’s
a
possibility
of
mootness
and
they’ve
raised
two
points.
first
of
all,
they
point
out
that
they
believe
that
our
clients
may
have
moved
out
and,
indeed,
they
are
correct.
our
clients
have
moved
out.
and,
secondly,
they
present
the
existence
of
a
new
statute
enacted
in
georgia
earlier
this
year.
as
we
indicated
in
our
sup--
in
our
response
to
the
question,
there--
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
why
this
case
is
not
moot.
first
of
all,
the
fact
is
that,
as
to
our
clients,
the
specific
clients
in
this
case,
mrs.
sank
and
mrs.
momman,
even
though
they’ve
moved
out
they’re
still
subject
to
the
double
rent
provisions
of
61305.
so,
there
is
no
way
that
this
court--
if
this
court
should
hold
this
case
moot,
we
would
not
be
within
the
brockington
case
and
hall
v.
beals
that
this
case--
this
court
decided
last
year.
in
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
grant
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
sought
that
was
in
brockington,
i
believe,
where
there
was
a
question
of
a
man
running
for
congress
and,
in
the
other
case,
hall
v.
beals,
the
court
just
talked
about
the
1968
election
and
said,
“that’s
history.
it’s
all
over.”
well,
it
isn’t
history
what’s
happening
to
mrs.
sanks.
mrs.
sanks,
as
a
matter
as
the
same
proceeding
which
is
before
you
right
now,
will
be
held,
if
the
landlord
does
no
more
than
walk
into
court
in
the
same
judicial
proceeding
and
ask
for
double
damages,
will
be
held
liable
for
double
damages
for
the
total
amount
of
rent
that
he
claims
to
be
due.
so,
mrs.
sanks--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
we--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
there’d
been--
we’ve
been
in
three
courts.
we
began
in
the
civil
court
of
fulton
county
where
there
was
a
judicial
opinion,
and
that
was
in
favor
of
our
clients.
it
then
went
directly
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
that
was
an
adverse
decision
and,
now,
we’re
here.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
it
wasn’t
at
all.
indeed--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i’ll
be
happy
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
under
georgia
procedures
when
a
trial
judge
feels
that
the
question
is
of
such
importance
that
the
rest
of
the
case
continue
until
a
decision
is
had
on
the
earlier
issue,
he
may
put
the
case
forward
for
appeal
right
at
that
moment
and
that’s
what
happened
in
this
case
and,
in
judge
william’s
opinion
which
you’ll
find
in
the
appendix,
judge
william
specifically
found
that
the
matter
is
of
such
importance
that
immediate
appeal
should
be
had.
so,
we
went
as
far
as
the
procedures
that
that
court
would
permit
us
to
go
and
we
couldn’t
file
the
bond,
and
that’s
why
we
couldn’t
go
further
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
the
federal
question--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
that
question
is
not
open.
all
of
the
issues
involving
the
posting
of
bond
have
been
closed.
the
substantive
issues
have
not
been
litigated,
namely,
mrs.
momman’s
defense
to
the
eviction
and
mrs.
sanks’
defense,
but
the
issues
of
the
bond
have
all
been--
we’ve
gone
as
far
as
we
can
go
on
those.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
the
only
federal
question.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
they
may,
of
course,
in--
if
the
case
were
to
continue,
there
might
be
federal
questions
arising
out
of
the
substantive
matters
and,
indeed,
i
suspect
it
might
but
that’s
apparently
not--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
now,
sir,
we’re--
i
may
have
misunderstood
you,
but
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
new
statute
became
effective
as
of
july
1
and
we
are
asserting
no
claims
and,
indeed,
that
statute,
we
contend
and
i
think
the
court
may
really
have
to
find
that,
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
these
proceedings.
the
dispossessory
warrant
that
we’re
dealing
with
was
taken
out
prior
to
july
1,
1970.
it
was
under
the
old
act,
and
our
contention
is
that
although
there
is
now
a
new
act,
and
i’m
happy
to
admit
to
the
court,
as
is
perfectly
obvious,
that
there
are
not
as
many
people
going
to
be
affected
by
the
act
for
which
we’re
talking
about
today
than
would
be
affected
by
the
new
act,
but--
and
so,
we’re
talking
about
a
relatively
small
group
of
people.
but,
we
are
here
today
under
the
old
act.
now,
it
is--
i
certainly
submit
to
the
court
and
i
think
i’m
being--
i’m
accurate
in
it,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
our
clients
and
potentially
other
clients,
indeed
the
clients
in
the
two
cases
that
are
now
pending
before
the
federal
district
court
and
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
at
least
those
two
groups
of
people
are
potentially
subject
to
double
damages
and,
in
this
piece
of
litigation,
i
think
that’s
important.
indeed,
in
looking
over
the
argument
last
time,
i
found
that
i
may
really
have
misled
the
court
because
i
suggested
that
a
second
lawsuit
might
have
to
be
filed
in
order
to
collect
these
damages.
i’ve
done
a
little
more
research
and
i
now
can
assure
you
that
that
isn’t
true.
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
if
you
should
hold
this
court--
this
case
moot,
for
example,
or
if
you
should
decide
for
the
appellee,
all
that
needs
to
happen
in
this
case
is
the
landlord
in
both
of
these
cases
goes
into
court
and
says
“i
now
want
a
judgment
amounting
to
double
the
amount
of
rent
that
has
been
paid
during
the
period
of
this
litigation.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir.
it’s
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
because,
sir,
i
would
presume
that
the
remedy
derives
out
of
the
action
as
it
was
filed
and
not
out
of
subsequent
changes
of
law.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
i’m
not.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’d--
i’m--
i
just--
it’s
an
area
of
the
law
that
i’m
not
familiar
with.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
it
certainly
isn’t
applicable
to
pending
actions
insofar
as--
that
now,
for
example,
there’s
no
question
of
having
to
post
a
bond
anymore.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
do
not.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
for
civil
actions,
in
general,
it’s
two
years.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there’s--
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
as
a
part
of
that--
of
the
eviction
law,
the
dispossessory
law.
i
take
it
that
the
court
is
suggesting
that
they’d--
obviously,
that
they--
that
a
lower
court
might
not
grant
the
double
damages
which
the
initial
lawsuit
permitted.
i
don’t
know
how
we
can
know
that
in
fact.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mrs.
momman
moved
out
about
a
month
ago,
but
she
was
there
until
that
time.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
other
lady
is
rather
hard
to
keep
track
of.
she
may
have
been
out
for
some
time,
but
she’s--
i’m
not
sure
how
long
she’s
been
out.
she
doesn’t
have
a
telephone
and
doesn’t
respond
to
our
communication
so
i’m
not
too
sure
about
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
just
didn’t
look
that
up.
i
obviously
should’ve,
but
i
didn’t.
as
a
general
rule
though,
on
these
eviction
cases,
i
can
say
that
the
courts
have
held
that
the
fact,
for
example,
that
the
tenant
moves
out
is
not
enough
to
free
him
from
the
double
damages
provision,
and
that’s
what
happened
here
and
i
would
suspect
that
the
courts
would
bring
that
into
play
if
faced
with
the
question
that
you’ve
raised,
that
is,
that
that
real
thing
that
may
have
made--
the
action
that
may
have
made
this
case
moot
is
the
fact
that
the
tenant
moved
out
and,
that,
the
courts
have
said
is
not
enough
to
prevent
double
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes.
i
think
the
case
is
moot
in
this
sense.
let
me
just
give
you
this
resonation.
the
case
is
moot
in
this
sense,
a
very
technical
narrow
sense
that
mrs.
sanks
and
mrs.
momman
have
nothing
to
stand--
stand
to
gain
or
lose
nothing
by
this
litigation.
in
a
narrow
reading
on
the
concept
of
mootness,
i
think
the
case
will
be
moot.
in
a
broader
reading
on
the
concept
of
mootness,
i
might
point
out,
as
we
have
in
our
brief,
that
you
have
the
meltzer
case
on
the
court’s
docket
right
now
which
raises
the
identical
issue.
you
have
wise
and
williams
which
are
the
two
cases
in
the
ju--
in
the
northern
district.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
i’m
not--
in
recovering
from
my
surprise
in
having
this
issue
raised--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
mr.
justice
white,
you
have
thought
of
an
aspect
in
this
case
that
i
never
thought
of.
that’s--that
is
what
my
surprise
comes
from.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
meaning,
that
the
remedies
continue
on,
i
take
it.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
there
isn’t
a
bondsman
because
we
never
put
up
the
bond
in
this
case.
so
that--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
how
we
got
here.
it’s
by
refusing
to
put
up
the
bond.
well,
i’ll
just
go
on
because
i--
let
me
just
finish
why
i
think
it’s--
aside
from
your
point
mr.
justice
white,
assuming
that
we’re
out
of
court
on
that
point,
let
me
just
continue
with
the
other
arguments.
there
seem
to
be
three
reasons
why
we
still
are
in
court,
unless
there’s
no
saving
statute.
one
is
that
those
ladies
are
subject
to
double
damages.
the
second
is
the
question
of
the
whole
statutory
scheme
involved
in
here,
both
303
and
305.
even
if
there’s
a
problem
with
303
and
i
think
in
being
honest
with
the
court,
i
must
say
that
there
is
a
problem
about
mootness
in
this
case
about
303.
that
is
the
posting
of
the
bond.
that’s
the
provision
that
relates
to
the
posting
of
the
bond,
and
there’s
no
way
that
i
can
figure
out
that
303
has
any
direct
consequences
on
our
clients
and
i
think
there’s
a
serious
problem
with
mootness,
narrowly
seen
in
this
case
on
303.
the
final
point
i
think
should
be
made
on
mootness
is
this
court’s
often
expressed
view
that
when
there’s
a
case
that
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review,
mootness
should
not
be
read
narrowly
but
should
be
read
in
a
larger
sense.
and,
i
think
in
this
case
that
would
be
the
problem
because
of
the
many
other
cases
you
have
that
will
deal
with
the
same
issue.
indeed,
there’s
another
case
in
oregon
that’s
going
to
come
up.
as
you
may
know,
there’s
a
main,
i
believe
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
a
main
case
on
a
very
similar
issue.
this
really
is
a
case
that
the
court,
i
suspect,
will
be
asked
to
deal
with
on
a
number
of
other
occasions.
i’m
just--
unless
the
court
has
any
further
question,
i’ll
close
on
mootness
right
there.
i
see
the
court
is
very
troubled
by
this
and
by
tomorrow,
when
we
finish
this
argument,
i
certainly
will
have
an
answer
for
you
about
the
saving
statute.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
just
take
a
few
minutes
and
talk
about
the
substantive
issue.
we,
in
our
brief,
talked
a
lot
about
equal
protection.
one
of
the
good
things
about
the
fact
of
coming
to
the
supreme
court
is
you
have
a
long
time
to
think
about
your
cases
and
chew
them
up
for
a
long
time.
the
more
i
think
about
the
equal
protection
argument,
the
less
excited
i
am
by
it,
and
the
more
i
think
about
the
due
process
argument,
the
more
excited
i
am
by
it.
i
come
here
today
not
asking
you
to
decide
this
case
on
equal
protection
grounds.
i
think,
in
many
dissents
before
this
court
and
in
many
majority
opinions
of
this
court,
misgivings
have
been
expressed
about
equal
protection
which
suggest
that
equal
protection
is
the
doctrine
that
ought
to
be
carefully
dealt
with,
i
think,
and
i
don’t
think
we
need
to
ask
the
court
to
go
as
far
as
equal
protection
with
its
notions
of
compelling
state
interest
and
its
notions
of
more
complicated
adjudication
of
constitutional
issues.
we’re
talking
about
a
very
narrow
little
question,
and
that
is
the
right
to
get
into
court
and
where,
it
seems
to
me,
we’re
right
within
snyder
and
we’re
right
within
goldberg.
let
me
finish
today’s
presentation
by
suggesting
just
two
ways
in
which
i
think
we’re
even
a
narrow--
we
present
a
narrower
question
to
you
than
was
presented
in
snyder
and
goldberg.
in
the
snyder
case,
for
example,
there’s
no
finding
of
indigency.
indeed,
there’s
a
specific
question
raised
as
to
whether
mrs.
snyder
is
indigent.
we’re
indigent.
it’s
clear
in
the
record
that
we
have
a
finding
of
indigency.
so,
you’re
dealing
with
more--
an
easier
problem
from
that
sense.
finally--
and,
secondly,
in
both
snyder
and
goldberg,
the
deprivation
that’s
talked
about
is
only
a
temporary
deprivation
of
the
use
of
property
and
that
was
pointed
out
in,
i
believe,
a
dissent
in
that
case
very
clearly
that
the
use
of
the
property
is
what
was
involved.
in
our
case,
once
they’re
out,
they’re
out.
that’s
it.
that’s
a
final
deprivation
of
the
property.
in
that
case
too--
our
case
is--
for
that
reason--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
what
i’m
talking
about
is
the
general
statutory
scheme
and
comparing
it
to
snyder
where
somebody
is
only
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
wages
but
where
an
eviction
is
carried
out
in
georgia,
it
is
a
final
eviction.
there’s
no
way
to
get
back.
i’m
suggesting
that
this
is
a
more
severe
punishment
than
the
court
faced
in
snyder.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
sir,
not
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
did.
it’s
also--
there’s
a
very
interesting
discussion
in
the
goldberg
case
about
the
consequences
of
welfare
and
why
welfare
is
a
right,
and
one
of
the
points
the
court
makes
in
that
case
is
that
welfare
guards
against
societal
molest
and
that
it
really
is
a
useful
thing.
it
helps
the
pursuit
of
happiness
to
have
welfare.
i
might
say
that,
it
seems
to
me
again,
that
we’re
an
easier
case
here
because
not
only
does
staying
in
your
house
guards
against
societal
molest,
but
the
kind
of
evictions
which
are
carried
forth
really
provokes
societal
molest.
one
of
the
things--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir,
i
take
it
that
it
means--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
societal
molest
is
a
phrase
that
the--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
the
court
uses
in
the
goldberg
case
and
it
says
“we
want
to
guard
against
that.”
what
i
think
happens
in
eviction
cases
is
people
get
put
out
on
the
street,
instead
of,
as
in
welfare
cases
as
sort
of
administrative
determination
being
made
in
some
downtown
office.
in
eviction
cases,
people
are
put
right
out
on
the
street
in
poor
neighborhoods.
that,
i
think,
is
a
major
creator
of
societal
molest.
those
are
the
distinctions
that
i
think
exists
or
the
reasons
i
think
this
case
is
easier
than
the
goldberg
and
the
snyder
cases,
and
i
will
rest.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
just
respond
to
justice
white’s
question
of
yesterday.
we
have
done
--
have
researched
and
we
have
found
what
i
suspect
some
members
of
the
court
may
already
have
known
there
is
in
fact
a
savings
statute
in
georgia.
there
is
indeed
a
constitutional
provision
that
says
that
law
shall
not
have
retroactive
effect.
the
--
upon
my
quote
from
the
typical
case
and
there
are
number
of
cases
that
make
very
clear
that
in
our
case
the
--
mrs.
sanks
and
mrs.
momman
will
be
subjected
double
damages.
but
a
typical
case
language
and
the
typical
case
says,
law
as
proscribe
for
the
future
unless
a
statute
either
expressly
or
by
necessary
implication,
that’s
language
that
used
throughout
the
cases,
shows
that
the
general
assembly
intended
that
it
operate
retroactively
it
will
be
given
only
prospective
applications.
particularly,
relevant
case
in
this
context
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sorry.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that
is
anthony
v.
penn,
212
georgia
292.
the
statutory
provision
is
the
constitution
which
is
part
of
the
georgia
code
and
as
cited
this
georgia
code
annotated
2-302.
the
statutory
provision
that
says
laws
proscribe
only
for
the
future.
they
cannot
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
nor
usually
have
a
retrospective
application
is
georgia
code
annotated
102-104.
the
closest
case
we
were
able
to
find
for
this
--
on
this
issue
is
the
case
of
leathers
v.
turner
75
georgia
appeals
62,
that’s
a
1947
case
and
it
involved
the
new
nil
that
was
enacted
in
georgia
at
that
time
and
the
debtor
in
that
case
was
attempting
to
have
his
rights
determine
under
the
old
act
and
the
court
said
that
only
--
and
the
creditor
was
asserting
that
his
rights
would
appear
under
the
new
act
and
the
court
decided
for
the
debtor
and
said,
only
when
there
is
very
express
language
in
the
new
statute
that
says
that
the
rights
created
under
the
new
statue
replaced
the
rights
under
the
old
act
only
with
such
express
language
does
the
new
act
apply
and
there
is
no
express
language
in
this
case
in
the
new
georgia
statute,
the
rights
of
the
debtor
--
of
mrs.
sanks
will
be
determined
by
the
old
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that
case
is
page
62,
75
georgia
appeals
62,
it’s
a
1947
case.
i
might
say
in
further
reference
to
mootness
since
i
know
how
much
that
concerns
the
court
that
that
raises
a
very
interesting
side
issue
that
again
i
haven’t
thought
of
and
your
question
stimulated
our
thinking
about
that.
if
305
is
clearly
applicable
in
this
case
and
i
think
i
feel
it
was
persuaded
that
it
is.
the
305
is
clearly
applicable,
it’s
very
interesting
what
happened,
should
this
court
decide
that
305
is
constitutional.
if
you
decide
the
305
is
constitutional
or
let’s
just
present
that,
the
case
goes
back
down
presumably
because
the
substance
of
issues
haven’t
been
raised
yet
and
at
that
point
under
305,
the
landlord
will
be
entitled
to
a
double
rent
judgment.
the
only
way
the
tenant
will
be
able
to
do
anything
about
the
double
rent
judgment
is
if
she
goes
in
under
303
assuming
that
you
will
not
decide
303
or
decide
adversely
or
she
will
have
to
go
in
under
303
and
post
the
double-rent
bond.
when
i
talked
yesterday,
i
was
fairly
certain
that
303
was
not
applicable
in
this
case,
i
think
that’s
been
kind
of
opened
up
by
your
questionings.
so,
i
think
the
303,
if
you
hold
305
constitutional,
we’re
going
to
be
stuck
with
303
as
well
and
i
think
the
point
that
makes
is
that
what
you’re
faced
with
and
what
we’ve
dealing
with
is
the
whole
statutory
scheme
of
303
and
305.
and
i
think
they
really
can’t
be
separated,
one
must
be
understood
even
in
this
narrow
case
is
this,
they
must
be
understood
together.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
conclude
the
cases.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
as
i
understand,
georgia
procedure
sir,
all
the
landlord
has
to
do
is
go
in
to
court
after
your
decision
and
ask
for
judgment
just
literally
walk
into
the
court
and
ask
for
judgment.
now,
if
we
and
we
will
not
be
able
to
assert
affirmative
defenses
without
filing
the
above.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
there
are
two
landlords
in
this
specific
case,
there’s
the
atlanta
housing
authority
and
then
there
is
mr.
sanks.
and
the
atlanta
housing
authority
is
not
a
vindictive
agency.
i
suspect
that
there’s
every
possibility
that
mr.
sanks
is.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
sir,
i
just
don’t
know.
i
understand
that
mr.
sanks
is
now
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
before.
i
just
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
because
there
is
no
procedure
at
the
present
time
for
filing
a
lawsuit
under
the
old
statute.
i
think
now
they
have
to
file
a
lawsuit
under
the
new
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i
suspect,
it
seems
to
me
that
logical
answer
is
that
the
case
was
filed
before
this
new
statute
took
effect
and
that’s
time
at
which
he
demanded
the
landlord
sought
to
have
his
rights
vindicate.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
think
that
we’re
swimming
in
a
dark
tunnel
as
related
to
the
question
that
you
just
post
sir,
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
a
lawsuit
were
filed
now.
but
i
think
the
georgia
law
is
quite
clear
on
the
laws
that
--
a
statute
--
a
lawsuit
that
was
filed
previous
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
has
not.
but
there
couldn’t
have
been
yet,
could
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
case
is
we’ve
been
able
to
find
require
very
specific
language
saying
that
it’s
a
bar
in
the
new
statute
and
there
is
no
such
language.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
am.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
they
were
ceremoniously
married
and
i
believe
some
time
ago,
40’s
i
believe.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
in
the
40’s.
mr.
sanks
then
attempt
to
do
evict
mrs.
sanks
from
the
premises
and
that’s
why
this
is
a
somewhat
confuse
kind
of
a
landlord
tenant
case
to
bring
to
this
court.
but
they
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
no,
they’re
not
living
together
at
this
point
because
she
is
now
out
of
there.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
at
point
have
gone
i
might
say.
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i’ll
be
delighted
to.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
i
just
like
to
add
one
comment
to
justice
white’s
question.
i
don’t
think
303
that
bond
posting
requirements
is
out
of
case
at
all
because
if
this
court
holds
305
constitutional,
the
only
way
we
can
litigate
the
substantive
issues
as
i
understand
what’s
going
on
is
to
post
the
bond
required
under
303.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
there
is
no
other
way
to
go
into
court
if
305
is
constitutional.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
sir,
that’s
the
statutory
intention,
i
think
that
was
the
intention
but
this
case
as
mr.
evans
points
out
the
procedures
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutorily
constructed
procedures.
we’re
in
a
kind
of
never,
never
land,
a
dark
tunnel
as
you
say,
a
procedure
and
what’s
happened
here
is
if
this
court
holds
305
constitutional
mrs.
momman
and
mrs.
sanks
will
be
liable
for
double
damages.
and
the
issue,
the
substantive
issues
will
never
have
been
litigated
such
as
the
question
you
raised
about
or
justice
blackmun
raised
about
whether
or
not
you
can
sue
a
husband
and
wife
can
sue
one
another.
all
the
substantive
defenses
that
mrs.
sanks
might
want
to
make
will
–
she’ll
have
to
post
the
double
bond
to
make
those
defenses
and
therefore
303
is
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
she
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
sir
she
has
been
sued
for
double
damages.
you
see
it’s
only
one
procedure,
the
procedure
that
was
began
and
led
to
this
case
is
a
procedure
for
possession
and
double
damages.
so,
she
is
liable
for
double
damages
and
the
only
way
she
can
make
a
defense
against
that
in
the
event
that
305
is
left
standing
is
go
in
and
post
the
double
bond.
obviously,
we
don’t
know
what
the
lower
courts
of
georgia
are
going
to
do.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
that’s
true
sir,
but
she
still
subject
to
double
damages
and
the
only
way
that
she
can
get
in
and
defend
on
the
merits
which
she
wouldn’t
do
on
possession
she
is
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out
we
don’t
know
what
the
other
side
is
going
to
claim.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well
i
think
there
is
sir
--
a
lawsuit
between
them.
i
think
this
suit
is
of
the
lawsuit
between
them
on
the
question
of
double
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
is
there
is
--
we
have
cases
in
the
brief
to
that
effect
that
they
said
very
clearly
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed.
the
georgia
supreme
court
says
very
clearly
that
all
they
need
to
do,
the
mere
fact
for
example
that
a
tenant
vacates
is
not
enough
voluntarily.
it’s
not
enough
to
relief
him
of
double
damages.
that
can’t
get
him
out
of
the
double
damages
and
all
they
need
to
do
is
get
a
judgment
from
the
dispossessory
suit
filed
under
303.
the
landlord
can
take
a
judgment
for
double
damages
as
well
as
possession.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes
sir,
--
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
a
great
impact
and
i
might
say
that
as
you
pointed
out
when
we
spoke,
when
we
appeared
before
that
the
georgia
court
has
been
serving
as
a
court
of
equity
and
really
ignoring
the
statute.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
court
just
felt
and
many
judges
in
georgia
feel
that
the
statute
is
so
inequitable.
there
must
be
a
way
to
get
around
that.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
well,
only
atypical
and
that
somebody
finally
snuck
away
in
to
let
us
get
into
court
and
that’s
what
many
people
have
been
trying
to
do
for
many
years,
is
to
get
into
the
court
and
nobody
could
ever
do
it
before
and
the
judges
said
finally
the
heck
with
it,
we’re
going
to
find
a
way
to
get
them
in
the
court.
the
problem
is
not
an
atypical
problem.
the
solution
can
thrive
with
an
atypical
solution.
mr.
michael
d.
padnos
yes,
sir.
