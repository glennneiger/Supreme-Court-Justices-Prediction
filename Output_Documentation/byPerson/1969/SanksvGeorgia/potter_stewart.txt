justice
potter
stewart
i
noticed
in
your
brief
mr.
padnos,
you
in
the
statutes
involved,
you
give
61-303
that
i
gather
this
proceeding
has
begun
under
61-301?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
not
an
action
for
money
and
cannot
be?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
--
which
of
course
sniadach
did
it
long
on
money
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
an
action
only
for
possession
by
the
landlord?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
upon
certain
limited
grounds,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
has
to
be
on
the
court
and
he
asked
to
take
an
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
make
a
statement
under
oath
in
court,
is
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
an
old
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
evans,
i
notice
if
under
61-304
of
the
code.
if
a
counter
affidavit
and
bond
is
corrupt
by
the
tenant,
then
it
becomes
a
duty
of
the
sheriff
or
a
deputy
to
return
the
proceedings
to
the
next
superior
court
of
the
county
where
the
land
lies,
and
then
it
says
and
the
facts
and
issues
shall
be
verified
by
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
loosing
party
after
that
jury
trial
pay
for
the
jury
also?
justice
potter
stewart
who
pays
for
the
dues?
okay,
is
that
public
money?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
mandatory
jury
trial
apparently
according
to
that
language
and
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
bill.
you're
not
talking
about
that.
there's
been
no
statutory
bill,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
a
bill?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
going
to
be
evicted
because
of
non
payment
of
rent?
justice
potter
stewart
the
grounds
for
the
eviction
there
is
non
payment
of
rent?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
padnos,
i
hesitate
to
bring
the
question
up,
but
i
think
there
is
a
question
of
mootness
in
this
case.
certainly,
the
suggestion
of
mootness
is
filed
in
this
case
prior
to
argument
and
my
recollection
is
that
the
court
deferred
consideration
of
that
motion
to
the
argument
of
the
merits,
and
i
would
expect
that
you’ll
be
dealing
with
that,
will
you,
before
the
end
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
want
to.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
entirely
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
new
georgia
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
the
chronological
history
of
this
case,
as
i
recollect
it,
the
intermediate
civil
court
agreed
with
you,
did
it
not?
and
then,
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
was
remanded
so
that
you’ve
never
had
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
up
until
the
supreme
court,
the
courts
were
deciding
in
your
favor,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
really
wasn’t
a
final
judgment,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
maybe
another
fact
we
ought
to
consider.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
remand
to
the
trial
court,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
federal
question
was
finally
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
only
federal
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
been
finally
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
preliminary
question,
we
got
off
on
a
little
detour
about
the
final
judgment,
but
my
preliminary
question
was
that
since
there
never--
since
this
was
remanded
for
a
hearing,
is
it
entirely
clear
as
a
matter
of
georgia
state
law
that,
under
this
statute
that
became
effective
i
think
july
1
of
this
past
year--
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
would--
the
soon
alleged
constitutional
affirmatives
would
attend
any
new
proceedings
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
at
least
three
times.
i
haven’t
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
not
what
it
means,
i
didn’t
even
hear
it.
justice
potter
stewart
ah,
societal
molest.
