would
you
say
that
it
would
be
wholly
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
require
the
tenant
to
pay
rent
pending
the
outcome
of
the
suit?
justice
byron

even
if
you
had
--
even
if
you
claim
a
valid
defense
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
payment
of
rent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
you
claim
that
rents
already
been
paid.
you
put
it
--
you
pay
it
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
and
the
foregoing
the
bond.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
says
that's
nonsense,
that's
nuts.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
would
be
the
same
whether
it
with
the
bond
perceive
a
man
or
what
you
for
rent?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
denial
of
equal
protection
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
in
terms
of
whether
it's
single
or
double
or
quadruple.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
not
if
you're
an
indigent.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
claim
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
a
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
--
do
you
think
that
a
person
has
a
constructional
right
presented
defense
on
that
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
determination,
that
determination
of
one
of
these
proceedings,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
landlord
gets
a
judgment
for
rent?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
double?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
me
he
has
resorting
to
the
courts
to
get
a
judgment,
isn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
filed
it,
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
landlord
files
the
case
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
tenant
doesn't
even
answer,
the
landlord
can
get
a
judgment,
can
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
some
court
might
say
that
this
bond
requirement
is
illegal
that
the
denial
of
equal
protection
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
would
be
also
be
disentitled
to
have
some
massive
protection
for
the
landlord
like
requiring
the
payment
of
rent
during
the
proceedings.
why
is
it
that
ample
protection
would
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
ample
protection
to
the
landlords
saying
that
the
bond
requirement
is
bad,
doesn't
mean
that
tenants
don't
need
to
pay
rent?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
cases
is
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
don't
need
to
talk
about
the
other
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
bond
required
because
the
lower
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
supreme
court,
it
says
that
there
should
be
a
bond
requirement,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
the
issues
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
bond
--
about
the
bond,
it's
not
about
the
requirement
to
make
the
tenant
pay
rent.
it's
the
bond
requirement
that's
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
it's
a
quietly
is
involved
to
--
for
a
state
to
say
that
a
person
who
can
afford
to
put
up
a
bond
may
litigate
with
the
landlord
is
evicted.
but
to
the
person
without
money
may
not
litigate
his
differences
with
the
landlord
in
a
court
even
if
he
pays
his
rent
while
his
doing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
expropriation
is
there
if
the
landlord's
property,
if
the
tenant
wants
to
present
what
might
be
where
there
to
anyone
would
say
that
on
the
phase
of
the
pleadings,
this
is
a
good
defense
as
the
landlord's
claim,
and
the
tenant
while
his
litigating
is
willing
to
pay
rent.
now
tell
me,
what
practice
the
landlord
in
a
failure
to
pay
rent
case
is
expropriated?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
reasonable.
georgia
court
has
held
that
the
statute
is
valid
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
suggested
to
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
is
your
defense
to
the
landlord
suit?
do
you
admit
non
payment
of
the
rent
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
one
and
the
ones
you
were
just
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
new
statute
specifically
save
the
rights
and
remedies
under
the
old
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
then
that
the
georgia
court
will
not
say
that
“now,
since
the
landlord
could
no
longer
have
double
damages,
we
will
not
give
him
double
damages.
that
remedy
just
isn’t
available
in
the
georgia
courts
anymore”?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
sure
that’s
true
in
cases
of
remedy
and
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
new
statute
is
silent
on
the
matter,
on
its
applicability
to
pending
actions,
and
if
georgia--
but
if
georgia
has
a
general
saving
provision
saving
rights
and
remedies
under
prior
laws,
under
repealed
laws,
well
you
have
one
answer.
but,
if
it
doesn’t
have
one
of
those
statutes,
you
have
certainly
the
common
law
rule
which
looks
in
the
other
direction.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
here--
let’s
assume
for
a
moment
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
landlord
getting
double
damages
against
your
client.
let’s
just
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
think
it’s
contrary
to
fact.
if
you
assume
that,
is
the
case
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you--
since
there’s
some
doubt
about
the
double
damages
matter,
this
might
be
of
some
case,
an
appropriate
case,
in
which
there
really
isn’t
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
action
in
this
court
since
our
jurisdiction
would
depend
on
the
double
damages
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
issue--
you
raised
it
in
the--
the
state
raised
the
mootness
matter
and
you
replied
and
said
this
is
a
statute
that
doesn’t
apply
to
these
actions.
i’m
just
quizzing
you
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
wholly
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
require
the
tenant

pending
the

justice

even
if
you
had
--
even
if
you
claim
a
valid
defense
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
payment
of
rent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
you
claim
that
rents
already
been
paid.
you
put
it
--
you
pay
it
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
and
the
foregoing
the
bond.
justice
byron

white
and
the

of

that's

in

whether

to

there's

which
you

justice
byron

and

do
you

justice
byron

white
well,
that

that
determination
of
one
of
these
proceedings,
isn't
it
possible
that
the
landlord
gets
a
judgment
for
rent?
justice
byron

white
or
double?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
me
he
has
resorting
to
the
courts
to
get
a
judgment,
isn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
filed
it,
doesn't
he?
justice
byron

the

files
the

doesn't

justice
byron

if
the

why
is
it
that

--
why
wouldn't
that
be

protection
to
the
landlords
saying
that
the

we

there

and
the
supreme
court,
it
says
that
there
should
be
a

requirement,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
the
issues
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
bond
--
about
the
bond,
it's
not
about
the
requirement
to
make
the

it's
the

that's
here.
