unknown
speaker
the
question
you
are
presenting
to
us
have
been
finally
decided
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
question
as
to
the
california
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
is
your
client
living
there?
unknown
speaker
how
long
since
she
left?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
other
one?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
citation
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
page
number
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
anyway,
you
conclude
the
cases
included
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
in
order
for
this
liability
to
be
imposed
upon
your
client,
the
landlord
must
take
additional
affirmative
actions,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
does
the
landlord
indicating
any
of
this
in
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
but
when
they
might,
what
is
their
view
if
you
put
that
question
in
this
program
to
discuss
later?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
was
a
hold-over
tenant
before
this
statute
became
into
existence
but
there
just
wasn’t
any
lawsuit
to
file.
and
today,
the
landlord
sues
for
double
rent.
the
tenants
long
since
gone
out
but
he
sues
them
for
double
rent
for
having
held
over.
brings
an
action
today
based
on
the
conduct
which
occurred
before
the
new
statute
was
passed.
you
say
the
old
statute
would
apply,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
--
why
doesn’t
the
new
statute
control
the
statute
because
you
haven’t
even
gotten
to
the
substitute
issues
yet?
unknown
speaker
how
can
there
a
procedure
for
him
to
collect
double
rent
from
you
when
you
haven’t
even
got
to
that
phase
of
the
lawsuit
yet?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren’t
we
really
sort
of
assuming
in
a
dark
tunnel
here
in
terms
that
the
impact
to
this
new
statute
on
this
lawsuit?
that’s
a
--
doesn’t
that
depend
really
on
the
complexities
of
georgia
law
and
its
savings
statute
and
this
is
sort
of
a
cross
between
procedure
and
substance?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
there
is
in
the
--
there’s
been
no
move
in
the
case
to
get
double
rent
yet,
has
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
alright
there
couldn’t
have
been
and
there
is
now
no
procedure
to
get
it
and
why
would
the
new
statute
to
be
a
bar
to
is
getting
double
rent
from
this
lawsuit
just
like
it
would
be
in
the
new
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
a
--
we’re
just
assuming,
you’re
just
assuming
that
the
savings
that
in
this
context
there
is
a
difference
between
this
pending
lawsuit
and
the
future
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
mr.
padnos,
would
you
straighten
out
one
that
a
confusion
that
remains
with
me.
what
is
the
relationship
between
mr.
sanks
and
mrs.
sanks
nee
jones,
are
they
married,
are
they
living
together
or
what?
unknown
speaker
in
the
40’s?
unknown
speaker
but
are
they
living
together?
unknown
speaker
were
they
living
together
at
the
time
of
the
eviction?
unknown
speaker
were
they
living
together
at
the
time
of
the
eviction?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
georgia
rule
against
suits
between
spouses?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
so
much
prefer
decision
on
the
merits
as
this
statute
has
now
been
repealed
and
there’s
the
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
classify
the
right
to
counsel
for
the
indigent?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
take
this,
i
don’t
mean
to
load
you
down
with
another
case
but
you
would
take
the
same
approach
in
the
boddie
case
which
preceded
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
come
out
at
the
same
result
there
as
you
are
arguing
before
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
why
don’t
you
leave
it
unless
the
picture
as
gray
as
we
talk
about
fundamental
fairness
of
constitutional
gossip?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
part
of
it,
difficulty
is
in
judging?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
a
few
in
your
opinion
the
question
of
double
damages
would
be
governed
by
the
new
law
or
the
old
law,
do
you
know
just
no
ready
answer
or
--
unknown
speaker
well,
like
that
they
may
be
able
to
recover
them
but
that
doesn’t
make
the
case
nothing.
unknown
speaker
but
the
tenant
is
out
of
possession?
unknown
speaker
the
tenant
is
out
of
possession
and
the
only
reason
he
had
to
put
up
a
bond
is
that
he
want
to
stay
in
possession
while
you
litigate?
unknown
speaker
so
the
bond
question
is
washed
out
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
question
--
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
dispute
between
these
parties
now,
but
possession
is
there?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why
can’t
you
just
have
to
post
a
bond
if
you
want
to
stay
in
possession
while
you’re
litigating?
unknown

the
