mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
mr.
padnos
did
not
in
his
oral
argument,
deal
with
the
poverty
question,
it
is
undoubtedly
raised
in
the
briefs.
therefore,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
things
right
at
the
outset.
first
of
all,
not
every
owner
of
rental
property
is
a
wealthy
slum
landlord
nor
is
every
owner
of
rental
property,
a
public
authority
or
governmental
agency.
in
georgia,
many
and
i
dare
to
say
most
landlords
are
very
ordinary
people
who
themselves
have
to
meet
mortgage
payments
if
they
desire
to
continue
to
be
owners
of
rental
property.
now,
the
relationship
between
the
owner
of
the
property
and
the
man
who
has
a
possessory
or
use
right
is
based
upon
contract.
in
lease
contracts
as
in
contracts
generally,
the
agreement
is
deemed
to
include
all
statutory
provisions
going
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
unless
the
parties
by
stipulation
of
the
agreement
waived
the
statute.
in
georgia,
for
over
140
years,
a
lease
agreement
has
been
deemed
to
include
the
agreement
by
the
tenant
that
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
rent
or
if
he
holds
over
or
if
he
is
a
tenant
at
will
or
by
sufferance,
he
has
agreed
that
the
landlord
has
the
rights
granted
by
georgia's
dispossessory
statutes.
appellant's
constitutional
contentions
are
based
on
equal
protection
and
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
shall
address
myself
first
to
equal
protection
and
presently
come
to
due
process.
looking
at
equal
protection,
i
might
start
out
by
observing
that
the
mystique
of
the
word's
equality
and
equal
protection
are
somewhat
like
the
trinity.
it's
much
easier
to
accept
by
faith
than
to
understand.
yet
i
think,
if
there
is
to
be
a
meaningful
discussion
on
equal
protection
or
equality,
we
must
determine
what
kind
of
equality
we're
talking
about.
there
are
as
i
see
it
two
types,
one
is
equality
of
treatment.
this
is
a
sort
of
a
numerical
equality.
the
other
type
of
equality
is
equality
of
result
which
is
a
proportional
equality.
the
distinction
is
really
quite
important
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
existence
of
one
will
invariably
negate
the
presence
of
the
other
to
illustrate,
college
tuition
at
a
state
university,
there
is
equality
treatment
if
there
is
a
standard
tuition
charge.
that
is
equality
of
treatment.it
is
a
numerical
equality.
however,
it
is
obviously
of
denial
of
equality
if
you
use
the
approach
of
equality
of
result.
to
have
equality
of
result,
you
would
have
to
in
effect
deny
equality
of
treatment
by
providing
that
one
student
must
pay
for
something
then
another
student
does
not
have
to
pay
for,
obviously,
denial,
equality
of
protection
--
excuse
me,
of
treatment.
now
the
first
equality,
equality
of
treatment
is
the
traditional
approach
used
by
the
legislatures
and
courts.
i've
given
the
example
of
tuition
at
a
state
university.
other
examples
would
be
sales
and
excise
taxes,
payment
of
gas,
water,
light
and
utility
charges.
bond
posting
requirements
for
public
officials
to
enter
into
office
assumed
the
duties
of
their
office.
all
of
these
things
are
based
upon
equality
of
treatment.
there
is
no
exception
based
upon
the
result
to
an
individual,
his
financial
means.
this
same
approach
has
been
traditionally
used
by
this
court
and
i
think
all
other
courts
that
the
decisions
which
i
have
read
in
connection
with
fiscal
requirements
for
narrow
situations
are
narrow
proceedings
were
involves
access
to
the
court.
i'm
emphasizing
for
a
very
narrow
type
of
proceeding.
cases
of
this
court
would
include
of
course
union
guano
and
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan.
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan,
the
situation
unlike
the
situation
here
involved
the
complete
denial
of
access
to
the
court
of
the
owner
of
stock
if
he
didn't
have
a
certain
amount,
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
to
present
a
defense
in
a
hovy
type
situation,
yes,
of
course.
you
have
considerable
problem
in
the
present
case
is
who
is
presenting
the
defense,
who
is
seeking
access
to
the
court.
we
would
maintain
that
under
georgia
procedure,
it
is
in
actuality;
the
tenant
who
seeks
access
to
the
court.
the
proceeding
does
not
go
before
a
judge
ordinarily.
the
landlord
goes
down,
he
swears
out
an
affidavit,
it
goes
to
the
sheriff
and
the
tenant
is
notified
that
he
must
within
so
many
days
vacate
the
premises
or
he
will
be
evicted.
there
is
no
judicial
procedure.
it
is
the
tenant
to
gain
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
this
possessory
proceeding?
the
landlord
can
get
a
judgment
for
rent,
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
is
only
if
the
tenant
takes
it
before
a
judicial
officer.
if
the
tenant
does
not
resist
the
eviction
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
landlord
files
an
affidavit,
but
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
at
this
point.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it's
really
not
so
much
a
judgment
as
just
the
sheriff
will
go
down
and
notify
the
person
to
evict.
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
maybe
that
would
clarify
it.
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
unless
and
until
the
tenant
files
a
counter
affidavit.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course
in
georgia
in
the
default
case,
you
still
usually
have
to
prove
damages
which
would
be
a
little
different.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
among
other
things,
he
will
be
subject
to
that
penalty.
and
when
i
come
to
due
process,
i
will
go
into
the
remedies
of
the
tenant,
where
there
is
a
wrongful
eviction.
i
think
that
really
deals
with
due
process
more
than
equally
protection.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
is
significant
because
as
i
said,
i
think
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
can
validly
take
a
common
or
practical
view
point.
this
is
not
a
very
broad
proceeding.
it's
limited
to
vary
narrow
grounds,
all
of
which
should
be
easily
within
the
mind
where
the
knowledge
of
the
tenant.
he
should
know
whether
he
has
paid
rent.
he
should
know
whether
he
is
holding
over.
it's
not
all
that
complicated.
i
think
in
this
context,
it
is
safe
to
say,
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding
when
the
tenant
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
yes
sir.
that
point,
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
this
would
be
a
different
procedure
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
haven't
explored
that
statute
recently
in
georgia.
i
have
discussed
the
first
equality,
which
is
equality
of
treatment.
the
second
sort
of
equality
and
now,
we're
talking
equal
protection
has
to
do
with
trying
to
attain
equality
of
result.
this
is
seen
in
such
items
as
a
progressive
income
tax
and
i
would
conceive
that
it's
also
seen
in
the
right
of
indigent
prisoners
to
secure
access
to
judicial
machinery.
that's
the
line
of
cases
starting
of
griffin
versus
illinois.
this
test
is
less
favored
probably
impart
because
it
involves
subjective
value
of
judgments
as
suppose
to
the
equality
of
treatment
which
is
an
object
of
test.
now,
moving
to
due
process,
due
process
i
think
has
to
do
with
essential
fairness.
that's
what
this
court
has
generally
set
in
the
past.
one
test
is
whether
shocks
the
conscience.
now
i
think
if
we
are
to
be
fair
in
judging
the
fairness
of
georgia's
dispossessory
proceedings,
i
think
we
have
to
examine
this
requirement
both
in
the
context
of
history
and
in
the
context
of
the
existing
landlord-tenant
relationship.
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
that
a
common
law
the
situation
was
one
where
the
landlord
could
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
evict
or
wrongfully
possess
tenant.
the
tenant
on
the
other
hand
was
not
without
his
rights
of
common
law.
he
had
an
obvious
right
on
contract
for
breach
of
the
contract
where
in
the
situation
where
the
dispossession
was
wrongful.
in
addition,
he
had
an
action
in
tort,
and
he
could
recover
punitive
damages
in
the
tort
action.
in
addition
in
the
proper
case
should
he
be
able
to
prove
fraud
or
some
other
proper
equitable
grounds,
he
could
go
into
a
court
of
equity.
now,
the
statute
which
the
appellants
attack
her
in
large
part,
it's
interesting
to
note
was
designed
to
help
the
tenant.
it
did
away
with
the
self
help
right
of
the
landlord
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
all
of
the
common
law
rights
which
the
tenant
possessed.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
have
this
at
common
law,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
all
things
being
considered
the
chance
of
injury
to
a
tenant
would
be
far
less
where
dispossession
is
by
a
disinterested
party
such
as
a
judicial
official
or
the
sheriff.
and
by
the
way
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
this
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
a
non-adversary
proceeding.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
not
in
the
context
because
i
think
we
might
come
to
it
right
now.
what
are
the
interests
balance
here?
i
agree,
this
is
a
harsh
remedy.
but
i
don't
think
it's
unfair.
it
may
be
harsh,
but
i
don't
think
it's
unfair.
because
what
is
the
balancing,
what
are
the
equities
balanced
here?
on
one
hand,
you
have
the
admittedly
harsh
effects
of
dispossession.
i'm
not
denying
that's
harsh.
on
the
other
hand,
this
injury
is
not
irreparable.
it
can
be
remedied
through
the
usual
common
law
norm
of
an
action
after
the
fact
of
the
injury.
this
is
the
normal
common
law
approach.
the
tenant
can
go
into
tort
and
recover
punitive
damages.
he
can
sue
in
contract.
he
has
remedies.
now
conversely,
if
there
is
no
protection
such
as
this
bond
for
the
landlord,
he
is
at
to
be
without
any
remedy,
particularly,
if
the
tenant
is
indigent.
if
the
tenant
truly
is
indigent,
how
do
we
protect
the
landlord
from
his
peculiarly
loss?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
would
take
time
and
there
would
be
loss
of
rent.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
there
would
be
loss
of
rent
to
the
property
owner
who
may
have
to
meet
a
mortgage
payment.
this
is
why
the
georgia
procedure
is
to
require
a
bond
to
protect
the
landlord
because
his
lots
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
one
adequate
procedure
undoubtedly
would
be,
a
rapid
adversary
proceeding
undoubtedly
in
a
small
state,
an
urban
state,
this
would
be
the
preferable
means
of
handling
the
situation.
i
can
only
point
out
that
georgia
is
the
largest
state
east
of
mississippi.
in
many
counties,
the
superior
court
has
the
two
terms
a
year.
and
it
would
require
complete
revamping
of
the
present
judicial
system
in
many
rural
areas
to
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
some
as
indiana
has
a
statute
quite
similar
to
georgia's.
they
also
require
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
believe
there
are
two
options.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
understand,
the
test
of
due
process,
it
does
not
require
uniformity
of
response
or
treatment
of
the
given
situation
by
legislature.
it
requires
that
the
treatment
be
reasonable.
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
is
the
treatment
here
is
reasonable.
in
view
of
the
different
equities
being
balanced,
this
is
not
a
situation
such
as
griffin
where
it's
a
fee
to
the
state
versus
personal
liberty.
this
is
a
case
where
it
is
--
the
balancing
of
economic
interest
of
two
classifications
of
private
citizens;
one,
the
dispossession.
true,
it
is
harsh,
but
can
be
remedied
by
an
appropriate
judicial
action
where
the
dispossession
is
wrongful.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
tenant
is
allowed
to
stay
in
possession
throughout
the
trial
presumably
throughout
the
appeal,
how
would
the
landlord
ever
recouped
his
loses?
he
can't.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
in
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation,
i
would
think
this
probably
is
quite
adequate.
however,
it
would
not
be
at
all
adequate
in
a
hold
over
situation
where
the
landlord
wants
his
property
back.
you
may
have
a
hire
use
for
it.
it
would
only
be
adequate
in
one.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
is
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
also,
there
was
no
bond
requirement
in
this
case
either.
so
perhaps,
but
yet
we
are
talking
about
the
bond
requirement.
there
was
no
bond
required
in
this
case
and
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is
true,
but
they
did
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would,
yes
sir.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
but
i
would
say
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bond
requirement
is
here.
yes
sir,
i
would
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
is
also
considered
to
have
a
right
to
property
which
shall
not
be
expropriated,
i
would
say
that
is
reasonable.
perhaps
not
in
a
case
--
well,
whether
it's
the
statute
is
designed.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation,
if
that
is
the
only
issue,
if
it
is
not
going
beyond
that
where
the
landlord
just
frankly
wants
to
repossess
his
property,
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
adequate
for
the
protection
in
this
one
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
but
the
statute
is
designed
for
three
situations
not
just
one.
and
we
think
that
looking
at
three
situations;
the
statute
is
designed
to
cover
everything.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
did.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
significant
development
was
the
passage
in
the
last
session
of
a
bill
authorizing
payment
of
the
cost
bond
rather
than
a
bond
for
any
set
lengthy
period.
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
it
would
be
perfectly,
the
tenant
--
again,
this
is
discretion
of
the
lower
court.
but
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
the
lower
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
allow,
say
double
the
rent
being
paid
monthly
if
the
rent
is
$50.00
a
month
that
every
month
the
tenant
could
pay
$100.00
into
court.
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
that
would
be
an
authorized
procedure.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
really
doesn't
essentially
because
for
this
reason,
the
bond,
amount
of
the
bond
is
really
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
local
court.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
the
court's
discretion
is
to
how
much
bond
is
required.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
the
penalty.
but
what
i
say,
it
is
indefinite.
now
that
you
have
two
statutes
involved,
the
bond
posting
requirement
merely
states
that
you
must
post
bond
for
the
damages
which
maybe
recovered.
you
have
to
look
to
the
other
statute
to
see
what
the
damages
are.
and
that
statute
provides
it
shall
be
doubled
the
amount
of
the
rent
involved.
and
of
course,
if
you
are
tied
up
in
litigation
for
six
months
is
could
be
fairly
substantial.
although,
under
the
new
statute,
i
do
think
it
ca
be
pay
on
a
monthly
basis
paying
double
the
monthly
rental.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
would
depend
on
contract
whether
there
have
been
what
the
contract
provided.
many
contracts
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
tenant
would
be
in
trouble.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
would
have
to
pay
post
bond.
this
does
not
mean
he
looses
all
remedy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
would
possibly,
if
there
is
a
fraud
involved
or
i
don't
know
the
end
of
the
situation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
desires
to
hold
--
it's
a
contractual
situation.
the
landlord,
if
he
desires
to
hold
a
person
to
contract,
i
think
has
the
right
to
hold
the
person
to
the
contract
the
same
as
any
other
contracting
party.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
beg
to
say
--
on
that
swip,
i
would
not
try
to
know
sir.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
rights
under
the
constitution
can
be
waived
by
contract.
i
think
they
could
validly,
many
rights
i
think
can
be
waived
by
contract.
certainly,
this
court
has
held
that
in
criminal
situations
and
accused
can
waived
certain
rights
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
a
statute,
it's
been
in
effect
140
years
and
the
people
had
been
accepting
it
for
that
long,
i
would
say
that's
rather
clear.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
would
say
it's
constitutional.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
because
of
longevity
mr.
justice
marshall.
it's
because
of
the
equities
balanced
that
we
feel
that
a
landlord
too
has
property
rights
which
must
be
protected.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
some
states
do
this.
the
point
is,
it's
probably
not
as
necessary
in
that
for
the
landlord
is
a
property
owner.
he
has
something
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
has
property
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
has
mortgage
payments
perhaps,
but
he
does
own
property.
the
property
can,
is
a
subject
of
recovery,
if
the
tenant
sues
the
landlord.
but
if
the
landlord
sues
the
tenant
and
i'm
saying
particularly
where
the
tenant
is
indigent,
it's
at
to
be
no
chance
of
recovery
at
all.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
i
know
of
no
provision
for
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i'm
not
sure.
my
colleagues
advised
me
that
maybe,
so
i
can't
answer
the
question.
i
don't
know
if
he
would
pay
for
the
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
on
the
factual
issues
presented.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
one
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
have
to
confess
ignorance
on
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i've
not
heard
of
the
charge
for
the
jury
in
georgia.
i
don't
think
that's
considered
part
of
court
cost.
you'd
be
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
i'm
not
aware
of
it
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
have
very
few
things
to
say
about
mootness.
quite
candidly,
i
would
much
prefer
a
decision
on
the
merits.
i
felt
it
was
my
obligation
in
light
of
the
change
of
statute
to
present
the
question
to
the
court.
i,
frankly,
am
uncertain
as
to
whether
there
is
mootness
or
not.
i
recognize
of
course
the
reason
the
case
is
here
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
two
statutes
that
is
i
suppose
realistically
speaking
moot
is
to
whether
there
is
mootness
as
to
the
particular
appellants,
i
am
uncertain.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
because
sir
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
this
entire
area
right
now
and
i
do
feel
that
very
likely
a
decision
in
this
case
could
give
guidelines
which
would
undoubtedly
spill
over
into
the
stress
warrants
which
are
now
under
attack
in
georgia
and
many
other
instances
where
due
process
issues
are
and
equal
protection
issues
are
being
raised
in
connection
with
pecuniary
requirements
generally.
i
suppose
i'm
looking
at
a
little
bit
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
georgia
taxpayer,
i
started
out,
i
anticipate
i
won
about
10
of
these
cases
on
technicalities
in
the
georgia
courts.
i
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
didn’t
think
i
was
doing
the
best
service
possible
that
it
came
up
over
and
over
again
which
should
have
adjudication.
therefore,
in
this
case
i
waived,
i
didn’t
raise
questions
of
the
merit.
i
left
that
go
by
i
didn’t
raise
any
issue
other
than
the
merits
because
i
want
to
do
adjudication.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
oh!
i
fully
understand
the
jurisdictional
problems
sir,
but
i
was
just
indicating
my
own
feelings
why
i
raised
the
question.
i
might
say
that
what
would
happen
if
it
went
back
is
also
a
picture
of
total
confusion.
in
fact,
the
statute
has
not
been
followed
in
this
case.
in
fact
the
rents
have
been
paid
into
the
registry
of
court
which
is
strictly
contrary
to
statute,
how
this
would
affect
the
double
rent,
i
have
no
way
of
ascertaining.
i
am
in
a
somewhat
unusual
position
in
arguing
in
support
of
the
statute
which
i
held
to
have
repealed.
but
while
the
position
is
unusual,
it
does
not
present
a
conflict,
i
work
for
the
new
law
not
because
i
thought
the
old
one
was
unconstitutional
but
because
i
thought
we
could
perhaps
do
a
little
bit
better.
good,
better
or
best,
of
course
do
not
raise
constitutional
issues
and
while
the
nebulous
nature
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
surely
must
provide
a
string
temptation
to
the
contrary.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
does
not
seat
to
second
guess
legislatures
as
to
whether
their
solution
to
a
particular
problem
is
the
wisest
or
best
of
the
available
alternatives.
now,
the
problem
presented
to
the
legislature
in
this
particular
situation
is
a
very
difficult
one.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
landlord-tenant
relationship.
how
do
you
handle
the
problem
of
a
tenant
who
wants
to
possess
another’s
property
to
which
he
may
well
have
no
right
at
all
while
he
litigates
his
claims?
if
you
allow
the
tenant
to
posses
the
property,
how
do
you
protect
the
landlord
from
irreparable
injury
in
the
event
of
the
tenant’s
possession
was
in
fact
wrongful?
in
as
much
as
the
landlord-tenant
relationship
is
contractual,
the
answer
may
some
times
be
found
in
the
contract
itself
but
what
if
the
contract
is
silent.
over
140
years
ago,
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
hit
upon
one
solution
to
the
problem.
it
decided
that
one
reasonable
way
of
protecting
the
landlord’s
interest
and
still
allowing
the
tenant
to
remain
in
possession
would
be
to
require
the
tenant
to
post
bond
as
a
condition
of
continued
possession.
statutes
dealing
with
the
subject
matter
of
a
contract,
of
course,
are
traditionally
deemed
to
be
incorporated
into
and
made
a
part
of
the
contract.
for
this
reason,
it
has
been
understood
in
the
state
of
georgia
for
over
140
years
that
if
there
is
no
stipulation
to
the
contrary,
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
state’s
statutory
dispossession
procedures.
i
wish
to
emphasize
at
the
very
outset
that
the
statutory
procedure
which
appellant’s
attack
is
a
procedure
which
they
in
fact
contractually
agreed
to.
i
think
the
case
could
well
be
decided
on
this
point
without
even
reaching
the
constitutional
issues
involved.
now
in
their
brief,
appellants
attack
georgia’s
dispossession
procedures
under
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
while
mr.
padnos
indicated
yesterday
that
he
was
less
intrigued
currently
by
equal
protection
and
due
process,
i
do
not
understand
that
he
has
wholly
abandoned
equal
protection
and
therefore
i
feel
i
must
comment
upon
both.
it
is
true
of
course
that
these
two
provisions
often
overlap,
but
they
are
not
identical.
because
i
believe
that
the
questions
raised
under
each
of
the
two
clauses
are
quite
different
in
this
case.
i
would
proceed
to
discuss
them
separately
rather
than
together.
looking
first
at
equal
protection,
i
think
it
is
rather
obvious
that
to
have
an
intelligent
or
i
dare
say
even
intelligible
conversation
on
equal
protection;
one
must
first
define
what
sort
of
equality
one
is
talking
about.
there
are
two
types
of
equality,
the
first
is
equality
of
treatment,
the
second
is
equality
of
result.
the
distinction
is
quite
critical
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
existence
of
one
almost
always
negates
the
existence
of
the
other.
to
illustrate
the
incompatibility,
i
might
refer
to
tuition
charges
as
state
university.
ordinarily,
the
fee
is
uniform
at
least
for
all
state
residents.
this
is
equality
of
treatment,
all
students
are
treated
alike,
yet
this
very
equality
of
treatment
clearly
produces
an
inequality
of
result
respecting
the
ability
of
indigent
and
affluent
students
to
enroll
in
the
university.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
word
“indigent”
could
somehow
be
classified
and
students
falling
within
the
classification
were
permitted
to
attend
the
university
tuition
free,
there
would
obviously
be
at
least
a
movement
toward
equality
of
result.
this
would
require
of
course
a
total
absence
of
equality
of
treatment.
i
suppose
what
would
follow
would
be
suits
progressively
by
students
just
outside
the
classification
of
indigency
until
ultimately
may
be
everyone
will
go
free.
for
reasons
which
ought
to
be
obvious,
it
is
equality
of
treatment
rather
than
equality
of
result
which
prevails
in
the
legislatures
and
in
the
courts.
we
see
this
in
public
utility
charges,
public
transportation
and
admission
fees
and
charges
for
public
accommodations
generally.
these
fees
do
not
show
very
according
to
the
pocketbook
of
the
consumer.
sales,
taxes,
excise
taxes
and
automobile
license
plates
fall
upon
rich
and
poor
alike.
theft
is
not
excusable
because
the
thief
is
indigent
and
therefore
has
--
is
under
a
greater
pressure
to
steal
than
the
person
of
means.
and
as
we
think
we
show
in
our
brief
the
authorities
to
date
are
rather
uniform
in
holding
that
the
great
number
of
bonds
both
in
the
federal
system
and
state
system
which
are
required
in
some
situations
as
a
condition
of
holding
office
and
other
situations
as
a
condition
of
access
to
courts
are
not
to
be
pushed
aside
or
enforced
according
to
the
economic
means
of
the
person
require
to
post
the
bond.
it
is
this
traditional
test
which
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
applied
in
the
case
at
bar.
having
adopted
the
equality
of
treatment
view
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
georgia
supreme
court
could
hardly
have
concluded
other
then
that
there
was
simply
no
classification
based
upon
economic
means
which
existed.
the
sole
classification
which
did
exist
was
that
of
being
a
tenant
which
like
that
of
being
a
student
has
nothing
to
do
with
economic
status.
since
this
test
negates
the
existence
of
the
indigency
classification
upon
which
appellants
chiefly
rely
in
their
equal
protection
argument.
we
feel
they
simply
have
no
equal
protection
argument
at
all.
the
result
of
course
would
be
different
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
requiring
equality
of
results
rather
than
of
treatment.
if
equality
result
is
the
constitutional
goal,
they
will
have
to
be
inequality
of
treatment.
under
this
approach,
the
constitution
would
presumably
require
a
sliding
scale
for
bonds,
bail,
tuition
and
all
other
fees.
in
each
instance,
the
individual’s
economic
means
would
have
to
be
very
carefully
scrutinized
to
achieve
as
equal
a
result
as
possible.
carried
to
its
natural
conclusion,
i
suppose
that
the
equality
result
test
would
require
the
leveling
of
all
differences
attributable
to
economic
circumstance.
if
not
from
each
according
to
his
ability,
we
would
at
least
have
two
each
according
to
his
needs.
i
think
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
courts
like
the
legislatures
have
been
reluctant
to
so
convert
the
equal
protection
clause
into
a
socialist
manifesto.
the
equality
of
result
approaches
have
been
very
sparingly
used
by
the
legislatures.
one
example
might
be
progressive
income
tax;
another,
various
welfare
programs
and
some
educational
programs
which
are
specifically
designed
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
poor.
inarguably
judicial
example
would
be
this
court’s
line
of
cases
starting
in
griffin
versus
illinois
which
hold
that
indigent
prisoners
must
be
given
the
same
appellate
remedies
as
are
given
to
those
prisoners
who
are
not
indigent.
i
say
arguably
because
quite
candidly
i
really
believe
that
the
underlying
rational
of
these
cases
is
not
equal
protection,
but
it
is
due
process.
while
the
difficulties
of
the
equality
of
result
approach
is
that
it
would
require
highly
subjective
and
personal
evaluations
which
defines
upon
distinctions.
this
is
not
of
course
true
of
the
equality
treatment
approach
which
is
a
traditional
approach,
which
is
acceptable
of
an
objective
judgment.
all
we
can
do
this
court
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
classify
the
underlying
rational
is
due
process
and
i
recognized
that
in
the
courts
--
in
this
court
i’ll
have
to
say
also
in
many
of
these
cases
the
two
have
been
sort
of
lumped
together
and
they
have
not
been
perhaps
analyzed
separately.
but
i
would
classify
this
due
process.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
only
--
in
my
own
judgment,
the
only
substantial
constitutional
issue
in
the
boddie
case
is
due
process.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
not
necessarily,
that’s
a
due
process
question,
i
have
not
yet
come
to
due
process
that
in
court
of
course
requires
the
balancing
of
interest
and
i
don’t
know
if
the
interests
there
are
the
same
as
they
are
here.
in
fact
i
think
they
well
might
could
different.
moving
due
process
--
two
due
process,
we
come
to
one
of
the
more
unsettled
areas
of
constitutional
law.
from
her
of
view
of
this
court’s
decisions,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
majority
view
is
essentially
a
natural
law
concept
--
a
fundamental
fairness.
this
test
has
been
stated
in
terms
of
whether
the
attack
procedure
shocks
the
conscience
or
whether
it
runs
contrary
to
essential
principles
of
ordered
liberty.
but
of
course
important
questions
remain,
whose
conscience
must
be
shocked?
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
not
merely
the
subjective
view
of
the
justices
on
this
court
which
should
control.
if
one
looks
for
objective
standards,
is
it
not
highly
relevant
that
the
statutory
procedure
in
question
has
been
in
effect
and
very
greatly
relied
upon
in
georgia
for
over
140
years.
it
certainly
hasn’t
shock
too
many
consciences
over
the
past
to
140
years
when
it’s
only
now
under
attacked.
i
think
if
we
are
to
fairly
judge
the
essential
fairness
of
georgia’s
dispossessory
procedures,
we
must
look
at
these
procedures
in
the
light
of
history
and
also
in
the
light
of
the
totality
of
the
landlord
tenant
relationship.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
common
law
situation
was
basically
one
of
self-help.
the
landlord
was
ordinarily
permitted
to
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
physically
remove
the
tenant.
this
was
obviously
harsh.
this
is
not
to
say,
of
course,
that
the
tenant
was
without
remedy
for
a
wrongful
eviction
of
common
law.
he
could
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
he
could
bring
an
action
in
tort
for
wrongful
eviction
where
he
had
the
possibility
of
recovering
punitive
damages.
he
also
could
secure
equitable
relief
in
a
proper
case
involving
fraud.
i
hasten
to
add
that
indigency
alone
would
not
give
the
court
equitable
jurisdiction
but
it
could
have
equitable
jurisdiction,
it
could
enjoy
the
eviction
if
there
were
other
equitable
grounds
available
such
as
fraud.
now,
in
past
arguments,
appellants
have
conceded
that
georgia
could
retain
the
common
law
situation.
this
being
so
are
not
appellants
in
a
rather
strange
position
to
be
attacking
a
statutory
procedure.
the
principle
aim
in
effect
of
which
has
been
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
tenant
to
improve
his
condition
over
that
which
he
had
at
common
law.
in
addition
to
retaining
all
of
his
common
law
remedies,
the
tenant
gained
a
very
valuable
albeit
qualified
right
of
retaining
possession
of
someone
else’s
property
during
litigation
as
to
whether
he
had
any
rights
to
the
same.
moreover,
the
tenant
was
spared
the
self-help
injuries
inflicted
by
the
landlord.
the
statutory
procedure
terminated
this
valuable
right
of
the
landlord
to
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
eject
the
tenant.
the
heart
of
appellants’
due
process
claim
of
course
is
that
now
this
qualification
to
the
statutory
right
they
gained
must
also
be
eliminated
for
reason
that
it
forecloses
them
from
access
to
the
courts.
we
emphatically
deny
that
appellants
are
foreclosed
from
asserting
their
claimed
rights
by
the
bond
posting
requirement.
to
start
with,
appellants
whether
or
not
they
post
bond
retain
all
of
their
common
law
remedies.
they
can
still
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
they
can
still
bring
an
action
in
tort
for
wrongful
eviction
where
they
can
get
punitive
damages
and
in
a
proper
case,
they
can
secure
injunctive
relief
which
could
restrain
eviction.
additionally,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
denial
of
access
such
as
would
shock
the
conscience
where
the
principle
argument
is
the
indigency
of
the
particular
persons
involved
as
this
court
said
in
omb
versus
morgan
the
question
of
whether
a
security
condition
is
reasonable
depends
upon
its
general
effect
and
operation
not
upon
instances
of
peculiar
hardship
arising
out
of
exceptional
circumstances.
in
omb
which
snyder
act
very
recently
treated
as
being
constitutionally
viable,
the
contention
was
not
at
all
unlike
the
contention
made
here.
there,
a
defendant
in
a
foreign
attachment
action
had
its
pleading
stricken
when
he
was
unable
to
furnish
security
in
the
sum
of
$200,000.00
a
rather
substantial
sum.
it
was
contended
that
this
denial
of
his
right
to
appear
and
present
his
defenses
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
this
court
disagreed
saying
that
the
statute
expressly
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
that
the
security
condition
did
not
as
a
matter
of
law
take
away
his
right
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
he
attempted
to
but
was
unable
to
obtain
the
security.
this
court
in
cases
as
union
guano
and
also
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
has
consistently
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
proscribing
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
to
the
seeking
of
judicial
relief
in
specific
situations
so
long
as
first,
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real
and
second,
a
legitimate
governmental
end
is
served.
certainly,
the
situation
here
is
specific.
it
involves
purely
possessory
rights
in
only
three
specific
situations.
they
are,
where
the
tenant
has
failed
to
pay
rent,
where
the
tenant
is
holding
over
beyond
the
term
of
the
lease,
and
where
the
tenant
occupies
at
will
or
by
sufferance.
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
correctly
i
think
noted,
these
are
facts
which
are
or
ought
to
be
easily
within
the
knowledge
of
the
tenant
as
well
as
within
the
knowledge
of
the
landlord.
we
think
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real.
the
interest
involved
here
are
for
a
cry
from
those
presented
in
the
line
of
cases
such
as
griffin
ver
--
starting
with
griffin
versus
illinois
or
goldberg
versus
kelly.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
balancing
involved
was
the
balancing
of
the
rights
of
individuals
versus
an
interest
in
state
funds
--
safeguarding
state
funds.
under
the
circumstances
presented
in
those
cases
which
were
spelled
out
very
carefully,
this
court
opted
in
favor
of
the
individual.
this
is
not
a
conflict.
the
interests
here
are
not
state
versus
an
individual.
here,
it
is
the
clash
of
economic
interests
between
two
easily
identifiable
classes
of
private
citizens.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the,
admit
and
we
don’t
deny
the
hardship
of
dispossession.
there
is
he
admitted
personal
hardship
of
dispossession
on
one
hand
although
this
is
a
hardship
which
if
wrongfully
inflicted
ought
to
be
and
is
compensable
by
damages
including
in
a
tort
action
punitive
damages.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
danger
of
irreparable
injury
to
the
landlord
through
lost
rental
income.
in
most
cases,
this
lost
could
never
be
recovered
particularly
whereas
here
the
tenants
are
indigent.
this
question
is
to
whether
they
would
be
liable
for
double
damages
on
if
it
should
go
back,
it’s
really
an
academic
question,
they’re
indigent.
the
landlord
will
never
get
initial
damages
much
less
double
damages.
i
simply
can’t
understand
how
this
can
be
said
not
to
be
a
very
real
basis
of
distinction
where
you’re
weighing
the
interest
of
two
competing
groups
of
citizens.
finally,
we
submit
that
protection
of
property
from
irreparable
loss
is
a
legitimate
and
indeed
a
compelling
governmental
objective.
under
the
georgia
constitution,
i
think
under
the
constitution
of
most
states,
protection
of
person
and
property
is
one
of
the
fundamental
justifications
for
the
very
existence
of
any
government.
for
over
140
years,
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
has
accorded
a
very
high
degree
of
protection
to
the
owners
of
property
including
the
owners
of
rental
property.
through
the
bond
posting
requirement
of
its
dispossessory
proceedings,
it
is
in
the
absence
of
the
stipulation
to
the
contrary
a
part
of
the
lease
to
which
every
tenant
agrees
he
can
vary
it
by
contract.
if
standards
for
shocking
the
conscience
are
truly
objective,
i
fail
to
see
how
after
140
years
this
statute
is
suddenly
in
this
category
of
unconstitutionality.
frankly,
which
at
my
conscience
if
the
state
could
not
protect
the
owners
of
rental
property.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
a
very
difficult
question
mr.
justice
black
and
of
course
i'm
not
--
it’s
not
a
test
that
i
personally
think
as
a
good
one,
but
i
would
say
it
would
have
to
be
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
at
the
very
least
it
would
have
to
be
based
upon
the
general
view
of
society
which
conceivably
could
change.
but
i
do
think
it
would
have
to
be
based
on
a
general
view.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
sir?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
one
which
would
shock
the
conscience
of
civilized
society.
it
should
--
this
should
be
the
objective
standard
tort
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
says
the
court
should
move.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
hate
--
i
dislike
to
even
comment
on
the
testified
obscenity,
i
frankly
find
it
so
difficult
to
grasp.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
fundamental
fairness,
it
is
of
course
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
again,
where
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
interpret
the
phrases
as
being
identical
shocking
the
conscience
or
fundamental
fairness
to
me
means
the
same
thing.
if
i'm
using
histrionics
i
am
borrowing
at
from
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
say
that
again
you
should
look
it.
i
think
it
should
be
looked
for
in
what
is
the
consensus
of
civilized
society
of
our
longstanding
judicial
traditions.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
--
well
this
court
has
said
it
ought
not
to
be
merely
the
personal
view
of
any
individual
justice
who
seats
on
the
court
at
any
one
time
that
is
what
this
court
has
said.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i'm
sure
it
is.
i
would
have
only
one
further
comment
and
that
is
on
the
double
bond
which
of
course,
i
agree
with
much
mr.
padnos
said
it
is
in
meshed
--
oh!
excuse
me
the
double
rent
provision
is
in
meshed
with
double
bond
in
effect.
the
only
thing
i
would
say
about
double
damages
is
that
305
which
was
attacked
deals
with
double
damages.
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
the
right
of
states
and
the
federal
government
for
that
matter
to
require
double
or
for
that
matter
trouble
damages
such
as
you
have
in
the
clayton
act
where
an
individual
can
be
oblige
to
pay
trouble
damages
even
for
unintentional
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
have
no
ready
answer
for
this
reason
as
i
believe
i
indicated
that
these
cases
have
not
followed
the
statutory
procedure.
now,
if
they’re
going
to
revert
to
the
statutory
procedure
is
something
i
do
not
know.
i
think,
in
fact
no
double
damages
ever
could
possibly
be
recovered
because
they
are
indigents.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
you
see
the
problem
is
the
court
deviated
from
the
statute
in
having
the
rent
paid
into
the
registry
of
court.
now,
whether
this
would
cause
an
equitable
reply
to
any
assertion
for
double
damages
i
assume
it
would.
certainly,
they
--
certainly
i
think
there
could
be
no
recovery
for
double
damages
for
the
entire
period
of
the
litigation
when
pursuant
to
court
order,
the
rent
has
been
paid
into
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
certainly,
from
that
time
there
could
be
no
double
damages
and
i
think
there
if
there
are
double
damages
if
there
are
none,
not
at
all
certain
it
could,
i
don’t
know
how,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
i
don’t
know
how
the
courts
would
handle
it
because
they
departed
so
far
from
the
statute
to
date
in
this
problem
that
i
don’t
know
how
or
when
or
why
or
if
they
would
go
back.
and
i'm
sorry
i
can’t
help
on
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
both
cases
the
tenant
is
out
of
possession.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bond
question
is
washed
out
of
the
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
again
it
is
presumably
if
this
court
for
example
were
to
rule
on
the
merits,
i
don’t
know
it
might
be
that
being
as
the
court
might
construe
this
to
the
best
of
rights
and
it
might
be
going
back
to
trial
court
assuming
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
affirmed,
the
trial
court
might
well
take
the
position
that
well
i
guess
they
can’t
come,
i
think
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
there
really
isn’t.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
i’m
saying
that
assuming
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
state
they
will
not
push
for
it,
but
obviously
this
would
ended.
i'm
assuming
if
the
landlords
attempted
to,
i
think
it’s
very
unlikely
they
would
attempt
to.
if
they
attempted
to,
i
don’t
know
what
the
courts
will
do.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
--
the
court
has
departed
from
the
statutory
procedure
in
these
cases.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
not
this
particular
matter.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
speak
for
the
landlords
of
the
states
a
whole
but
not
this
particular
instance.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
mr.
padnos
did
not
in
his
oral
argument,
deal
with
the
poverty
question,
it
is
undoubtedly
raised
in
the
briefs.
therefore,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
things
right
at
the
outset.
first
of
all,
not
every
owner
of
rental
property
is
a
wealthy
slum
landlord
nor
is
every
owner
of
rental
property,
a
public
authority
or
governmental
agency.
in
georgia,
many
and
i
dare
to
say
most
landlords
are
very
ordinary
people
who
themselves
have
to
meet
mortgage
payments
if
they
desire
to
continue
to
be
owners
of
rental
property.
now,
the
relationship
between
the
owner
of
the
property
and
the
man
who
has
a
possessory
or
use
right
is
based
upon
contract.
in
lease
contracts
as
in
contracts
generally,
the
agreement
is
deemed
to
include
all
statutory
provisions
going
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
unless
the
parties
by
stipulation
of
the
agreement
waived
the
statute.
in
georgia,
for
over
140
years,
a
lease
agreement
has
been
deemed
to
include
the
agreement
by
the
tenant
that
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
rent
or
if
he
holds
over
or
if
he
is
a
tenant
at
will
or
by
sufferance,
he
has
agreed
that
the
landlord
has
the
rights
granted
by
georgia's
dispossessory
statutes.
appellant's
constitutional
contentions
are
based
on
equal
protection
and
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
shall
address
myself
first
to
equal
protection
and
presently
come
to
due
process.
looking
at
equal
protection,
i
might
start
out
by
observing
that
the
mystique
of
the
word's
equality
and
equal
protection
are
somewhat
like
the
trinity.
it's
much
easier
to
accept
by
faith
than
to
understand.
yet
i
think,
if
there
is
to
be
a
meaningful
discussion
on
equal
protection
or
equality,
we
must
determine
what
kind
of
equality
we're
talking
about.
there
are
as
i
see
it
two
types,
one
is
equality
of
treatment.
this
is
a
sort
of
a
numerical
equality.
the
other
type
of
equality
is
equality
of
result
which
is
a
proportional
equality.
the
distinction
is
really
quite
important
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
existence
of
one
will
invariably
negate
the
presence
of
the
other
to
illustrate,
college
tuition
at
a
state
university,
there
is
equality
treatment
if
there
is
a
standard
tuition
charge.
that
is
equality
of
treatment.it
is
a
numerical
equality.
however,
it
is
obviously
of
denial
of
equality
if
you
use
the
approach
of
equality
of
result.
to
have
equality
of
result,
you
would
have
to
in
effect
deny
equality
of
treatment
by
providing
that
one
student
must
pay
for
something
then
another
student
does
not
have
to
pay
for,
obviously,
denial,
equality
of
protection
--
excuse
me,
of
treatment.
now
the
first
equality,
equality
of
treatment
is
the
traditional
approach
used
by
the
legislatures
and
courts.
i've
given
the
example
of
tuition
at
a
state
university.
other
examples
would
be
sales
and
excise
taxes,
payment
of
gas,
water,
light
and
utility
charges.
bond
posting
requirements
for
public
officials
to
enter
into
office
assumed
the
duties
of
their
office.
all
of
these
things
are
based
upon
equality
of
treatment.
there
is
no
exception
based
upon
the
result
to
an
individual,
his
financial
means.
this
same
approach
has
been
traditionally
used
by
this
court
and
i
think
all
other
courts
that
the
decisions
which
i
have
read
in
connection
with
fiscal
requirements
for
narrow
situations
are
narrow
proceedings
were
involves
access
to
the
court.
i'm
emphasizing
for
a
very
narrow
type
of
proceeding.
cases
of
this
court
would
include
of
course
union
guano
and
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan.
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan,
the
situation
unlike
the
situation
here
involved
the
complete
denial
of
access
to
the
court
of
the
owner
of
stock
if
he
didn't
have
a
certain
amount,
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
to
present
a
defense
in
a
hovy
type
situation,
yes,
of
course.
you
have
considerable
problem
in
the
present
case
is
who
is
presenting
the
defense,
who
is
seeking
access
to
the
court.
we
would
maintain
that
under
georgia
procedure,
it
is
in
actuality;
the
tenant
who
seeks
access
to
the
court.
the
proceeding
does
not
go
before
a
judge
ordinarily.
the
landlord
goes
down,
he
swears
out
an
affidavit,
it
goes
to
the
sheriff
and
the
tenant
is
notified
that
he
must
within
so
many
days
vacate
the
premises
or
he
will
be
evicted.
there
is
no
judicial
procedure.
it
is
the
tenant
to
gain
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
this
possessory
proceeding?
the
landlord
can
get
a
judgment
for
rent,
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
is
only
if
the
tenant
takes
it
before
a
judicial
officer.
if
the
tenant
does
not
resist
the
eviction
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
landlord
files
an
affidavit,
but
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
at
this
point.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it's
really
not
so
much
a
judgment
as
just
the
sheriff
will
go
down
and
notify
the
person
to
evict.
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
maybe
that
would
clarify
it.
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
unless
and
until
the
tenant
files
a
counter
affidavit.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of
course
in
georgia
in
the
default
case,
you
still
usually
have
to
prove
damages
which
would
be
a
little
different.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
among
other
things,
he
will
be
subject
to
that
penalty.
and
when
i
come
to
due
process,
i
will
go
into
the
remedies
of
the
tenant,
where
there
is
a
wrongful
eviction.
i
think
that
really
deals
with
due
process
more
than
equally
protection.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
is
significant
because
as
i
said,
i
think
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
can
validly
take
a
common
or
practical
view
point.
this
is
not
a
very
broad
proceeding.
it's
limited
to
vary
narrow
grounds,
all
of
which
should
be
easily
within
the
mind
where
the
knowledge
of
the
tenant.
he
should
know
whether
he
has
paid
rent.
he
should
know
whether
he
is
holding
over.
it's
not
all
that
complicated.
i
think
in
this
context,
it
is
safe
to
say,
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding
when
the
tenant
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
yes
sir.
that
point,
it
becomes
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
this
would
be
a
different
procedure
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
haven't
explored
that
statute
recently
in
georgia.
i
have
discussed
the
first
equality,
which
is
equality
of
treatment.
the
second
sort
of
equality
and
now,
we're
talking
equal
protection
has
to
do
with
trying
to
attain
equality
of
result.
this
is
seen
in
such
items
as
a
progressive
income
tax
and
i
would
conceive
that
it's
also
seen
in
the
right
of
indigent
prisoners
to
secure
access
to
judicial
machinery.
that's
the
line
of
cases
starting
of
griffin
versus
illinois.
this
test
is
less
favored
probably
impart
because
it
involves
subjective
value
of
judgments
as
suppose
to
the
equality
of
treatment
which
is
an
object
of
test.
now,
moving
to
due
process,
due
process
i
think
has
to
do
with
essential
fairness.
that's
what
this
court
has
generally
set
in
the
past.
one
test
is
whether
shocks
the
conscience.
now
i
think
if
we
are
to
be
fair
in
judging
the
fairness
of
georgia's
dispossessory
proceedings,
i
think
we
have
to
examine
this
requirement
both
in
the
context
of
history
and
in
the
context
of
the
existing
landlord-tenant
relationship.
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
that
a
common
law
the
situation
was
one
where
the
landlord
could
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
evict
or
wrongfully
possess
tenant.
the
tenant
on
the
other
hand
was
not
without
his
rights
of
common
law.
he
had
an
obvious
right
on
contract
for
breach
of
the
contract
where
in
the
situation
where
the
dispossession
was
wrongful.
in
addition,
he
had
an
action
in
tort,
and
he
could
recover
punitive
damages
in
the
tort
action.
in
addition
in
the
proper
case
should
he
be
able
to
prove
fraud
or
some
other
proper
equitable
grounds,
he
could
go
into
a
court
of
equity.
now,
the
statute
which
the
appellants
attack
her
in
large
part,
it's
interesting
to
note
was
designed
to
help
the
tenant.
it
did
away
with
the
self
help
right
of
the
landlord
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
all
of
the
common
law
rights
which
the
tenant
possessed.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
have
this
at
common
law,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
all
things
being
considered
the
chance
of
injury
to
a
tenant
would
be
far
less
where
dispossession
is
by
a
disinterested
party
such
as
a
judicial
official
or
the
sheriff.
and
by
the
way
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
this
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
a
non-adversary
proceeding.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
not
in
the
context
because
i
think
we
might
come
to
it
right
now.
what
are
the
interests
balance
here?
i
agree,
this
is
a
harsh
remedy.
but
i
don't
think
it's
unfair.
it
may
be
harsh,
but
i
don't
think
it's
unfair.
because
what
is
the
balancing,
what
are
the
equities
balanced
here?
on
one
hand,
you
have
the
admittedly
harsh
effects
of
dispossession.
i'm
not
denying
that's
harsh.
on
the
other
hand,
this
injury
is
not
irreparable.
it
can
be
remedied
through
the
usual
common
law
norm
of
an
action
after
the
fact
of
the
injury.
this
is
the
normal
common
law
approach.
the
tenant
can
go
into
tort
and
recover
punitive
damages.
he
can
sue
in
contract.
he
has
remedies.
now
conversely,
if
there
is
no
protection
such
as
this
bond
for
the
landlord,
he
is
at
to
be
without
any
remedy,
particularly,
if
the
tenant
is
indigent.
if
the
tenant
truly
is
indigent,
how
do
we
protect
the
landlord
from
his
peculiarly
loss?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
would
take
time
and
there
would
be
loss
of
rent.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
there
would
be
loss
of
rent
to
the
property
owner
who
may
have
to
meet
a
mortgage
payment.
this
is
why
the
georgia
procedure
is
to
require
a
bond
to
protect
the
landlord
because
his
lots
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
one
adequate
procedure
undoubtedly
would
be,
a
rapid
adversary
proceeding
undoubtedly
in
a
small
state,
an
urban
state,
this
would
be
the
preferable
means
of
handling
the
situation.
i
can
only
point
out
that
georgia
is
the
largest
state
east
of
mississippi.
in
many
counties,
the
superior
court
has
the
two
terms
a
year.
and
it
would
require
complete
revamping
of
the
present
judicial
system
in
many
rural
areas
to
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
some
as
indiana
has
a
statute
quite
similar
to
georgia's.
they
also
require
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
believe
there
are
two
options.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
understand,
the
test
of
due
process,
it
does
not
require
uniformity
of
response
or
treatment
of
the
given
situation
by
legislature.
it
requires
that
the
treatment
be
reasonable.
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
is
the
treatment
here
is
reasonable.
in
view
of
the
different
equities
being
balanced,
this
is
not
a
situation
such
as
griffin
where
it's
a
fee
to
the
state
versus
personal
liberty.
this
is
a
case
where
it
is
--
the
balancing
of
economic
interest
of
two
classifications
of
private
citizens;
one,
the
dispossession.
true,
it
is
harsh,
but
can
be
remedied
by
an
appropriate
judicial
action
where
the
dispossession
is
wrongful.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
tenant
is
allowed
to
stay
in
possession
throughout
the
trial
presumably
throughout
the
appeal,
how
would
the
landlord
ever
recouped
his
loses?
he
can't.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
in
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation,
i
would
think
this
probably
is
quite
adequate.
however,
it
would
not
be
at
all
adequate
in
a
hold
over
situation
where
the
landlord
wants
his
property
back.
you
may
have
a
hire
use
for
it.
it
would
only
be
adequate
in
one.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
is
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
also,
there
was
no
bond
requirement
in
this
case
either.
so
perhaps,
but
yet
we
are
talking
about
the
bond
requirement.
there
was
no
bond
required
in
this
case
and
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is
true,
but
they
did
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would,
yes
sir.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
but
i
would
say
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bond
requirement
is
here.
yes
sir,
i
would
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
is
also
considered
to
have
a
right
to
property
which
shall
not
be
expropriated,
i
would
say
that
is
reasonable.
perhaps
not
in
a
case
--
well,
whether
it's
the
statute
is
designed.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
a
failure
to
pay
rent
situation,
if
that
is
the
only
issue,
if
it
is
not
going
beyond
that
where
the
landlord
just
frankly
wants
to
repossess
his
property,
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
adequate
for
the
protection
in
this
one
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
but
the
statute
is
designed
for
three
situations
not
just
one.
and
we
think
that
looking
at
three
situations;
the
statute
is
designed
to
cover
everything.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
did.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
significant
development
was
the
passage
in
the
last
session
of
a
bill
authorizing
payment
of
the
cost
bond
rather
than
a
bond
for
any
set
lengthy
period.
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
it
would
be
perfectly,
the
tenant
--
again,
this
is
discretion
of
the
lower
court.
but
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
the
lower
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
allow,
say
double
the
rent
being
paid
monthly
if
the
rent
is
$50.00
a
month
that
every
month
the
tenant
could
pay
$100.00
into
court.
as
i
read
the
new
statute,
that
would
be
an
authorized
procedure.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
really
doesn't
essentially
because
for
this
reason,
the
bond,
amount
of
the
bond
is
really
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
local
court.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
the
court's
discretion
is
to
how
much
bond
is
required.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
the
penalty.
but
what
i
say,
it
is
indefinite.
now
that
you
have
two
statutes
involved,
the
bond
posting
requirement
merely
states
that
you
must
post
bond
for
the
damages
which
maybe
recovered.
you
have
to
look
to
the
other
statute
to
see
what
the
damages
are.
and
that
statute
provides
it
shall
be
doubled
the
amount
of
the
rent
involved.
and
of
course,
if
you
are
tied
up
in
litigation
for
six
months
is
could
be
fairly
substantial.
although,
under
the
new
statute,
i
do
think
it
ca
be
pay
on
a
monthly
basis
paying
double
the
monthly
rental.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
this
would
depend
on
contract
whether
there
have
been
what
the
contract
provided.
many
contracts
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
tenant
would
be
in
trouble.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
would
have
to
pay
post
bond.
this
does
not
mean
he
looses
all
remedy.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
would
possibly,
if
there
is
a
fraud
involved
or
i
don't
know
the
end
of
the
situation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
desires
to
hold
--
it's
a
contractual
situation.
the
landlord,
if
he
desires
to
hold
a
person
to
contract,
i
think
has
the
right
to
hold
the
person
to
the
contract
the
same
as
any
other
contracting
party.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
beg
to
say
--
on
that
swip,
i
would
not
try
to
know
sir.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
rights
under
the
constitution
can
be
waived
by
contract.
i
think
they
could
validly,
many
rights
i
think
can
be
waived
by
contract.
certainly,
this
court
has
held
that
in
criminal
situations
and
accused
can
waived
certain
rights
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
a
statute,
it's
been
in
effect
140
years
and
the
people
had
been
accepting
it
for
that
long,
i
would
say
that's
rather
clear.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
would
say
it's
constitutional.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
because
of
longevity
mr.
justice
marshall.
it's
because
of
the
equities
balanced
that
we
feel
that
a
landlord
too
has
property
rights
which
must
be
protected.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
some
states
do
this.
the
point
is,
it's
probably
not
as
necessary
in
that
for
the
landlord
is
a
property
owner.
he
has
something
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
has
property
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
he
has
mortgage
payments
perhaps,
but
he
does
own
property.
the
property
can,
is
a
subject
of
recovery,
if
the
tenant
sues
the
landlord.
but
if
the
landlord
sues
the
tenant
and
i'm
saying
particularly
where
the
tenant
is
indigent,
it's
at
to
be
no
chance
of
recovery
at
all.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
i
know
of
no
provision
for
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i'm
not
sure.
my
colleagues
advised
me
that
maybe,
so
i
can't
answer
the
question.
i
don't
know
if
he
would
pay
for
the
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
on
the
factual
issues
presented.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
one
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
have
to
confess
ignorance
on
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i've
not
heard
of
the
charge
for
the
jury
in
georgia.
i
don't
think
that's
considered
part
of
court
cost.
you'd
be
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well
i'm
not
aware
of
it
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
have
very
few
things
to
say
about
mootness.
quite
candidly,
i
would
much
prefer
a
decision
on
the
merits.
i
felt
it
was
my
obligation
in
light
of
the
change
of
statute
to
present
the
question
to
the
court.
i,
frankly,
am
uncertain
as
to
whether
there
is
mootness
or
not.
i
recognize
of
course
the
reason
the
case
is
here
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
two
statutes
that
is
i
suppose
realistically
speaking
moot
is
to
whether
there
is
mootness
as
to
the
particular
appellants,
i
am
uncertain.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
because
sir
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
this
entire
area
right
now
and
i
do
feel
that
very
likely
a
decision
in
this
case
could
give
guidelines
which
would
undoubtedly
spill
over
into
the
stress
warrants
which
are
now
under
attack
in
georgia
and
many
other
instances
where
due
process
issues
are
and
equal
protection
issues
are
being
raised
in
connection
with
pecuniary
requirements
generally.
i
suppose
i'm
looking
at
a
little
bit
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
georgia
taxpayer,
i
started
out,
i
anticipate
i
won
about
10
of
these
cases
on
technicalities
in
the
georgia
courts.
i
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
didn’t
think
i
was
doing
the
best
service
possible
that
it
came
up
over
and
over
again
which
should
have
adjudication.
therefore,
in
this
case
i
waived,
i
didn’t
raise
questions
of
the
merit.
i
left
that
go
by
i
didn’t
raise
any
issue
other
than
the
merits
because
i
want
to
do
adjudication.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
oh!
i
fully
understand
the
jurisdictional
problems
sir,
but
i
was
just
indicating
my
own
feelings
why
i
raised
the
question.
i
might
say
that
what
would
happen
if
it
went
back
is
also
a
picture
of
total
confusion.
in
fact,
the
statute
has
not
been
followed
in
this
case.
in
fact
the
rents
have
been
paid
into
the
registry
of
court
which
is
strictly
contrary
to
statute,
how
this
would
affect
the
double
rent,
i
have
no
way
of
ascertaining.
i
am
in
a
somewhat
unusual
position
in
arguing
in
support
of
the
statute
which
i
held
to
have
repealed.
but
while
the
position
is
unusual,
it
does
not
present
a
conflict,
i
work
for
the
new
law
not
because
i
thought
the
old
one
was
unconstitutional
but
because
i
thought
we
could
perhaps
do
a
little
bit
better.
good,
better
or
best,
of
course
do
not
raise
constitutional
issues
and
while
the
nebulous
nature
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
surely
must
provide
a
string
temptation
to
the
contrary.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
does
not
seat
to
second
guess
legislatures
as
to
whether
their
solution
to
a
particular
problem
is
the
wisest
or
best
of
the
available
alternatives.
now,
the
problem
presented
to
the
legislature
in
this
particular
situation
is
a
very
difficult
one.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
landlord-tenant
relationship.
how
do
you
handle
the
problem
of
a
tenant
who
wants
to
possess
another’s
property
to
which
he
may
well
have
no
right
at
all
while
he
litigates
his
claims?
if
you
allow
the
tenant
to
posses
the
property,
how
do
you
protect
the
landlord
from
irreparable
injury
in
the
event
of
the
tenant’s
possession
was
in
fact
wrongful?
in
as
much
as
the
landlord-tenant
relationship
is
contractual,
the
answer
may
some
times
be
found
in
the
contract
itself
but
what
if
the
contract
is
silent.
over
140
years
ago,
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
hit
upon
one
solution
to
the
problem.
it
decided
that
one
reasonable
way
of
protecting
the
landlord’s
interest
and
still
allowing
the
tenant
to
remain
in
possession
would
be
to
require
the
tenant
to
post
bond
as
a
condition
of
continued
possession.
statutes
dealing
with
the
subject
matter
of
a
contract,
of
course,
are
traditionally
deemed
to
be
incorporated
into
and
made
a
part
of
the
contract.
for
this
reason,
it
has
been
understood
in
the
state
of
georgia
for
over
140
years
that
if
there
is
no
stipulation
to
the
contrary,
the
landlord
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
state’s
statutory
dispossession
procedures.
i
wish
to
emphasize
at
the
very
outset
that
the
statutory
procedure
which
appellant’s
attack
is
a
procedure
which
they
in
fact
contractually
agreed
to.
i
think
the
case
could
well
be
decided
on
this
point
without
even
reaching
the
constitutional
issues
involved.
now
in
their
brief,
appellants
attack
georgia’s
dispossession
procedures
under
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
while
mr.
padnos
indicated
yesterday
that
he
was
less
intrigued
currently
by
equal
protection
and
due
process,
i
do
not
understand
that
he
has
wholly
abandoned
equal
protection
and
therefore
i
feel
i
must
comment
upon
both.
it
is
true
of
course
that
these
two
provisions
often
overlap,
but
they
are
not
identical.
because
i
believe
that
the
questions
raised
under
each
of
the
two
clauses
are
quite
different
in
this
case.
i
would
proceed
to
discuss
them
separately
rather
than
together.
looking
first
at
equal
protection,
i
think
it
is
rather
obvious
that
to
have
an
intelligent
or
i
dare
say
even
intelligible
conversation
on
equal
protection;
one
must
first
define
what
sort
of
equality
one
is
talking
about.
there
are
two
types
of
equality,
the
first
is
equality
of
treatment,
the
second
is
equality
of
result.
the
distinction
is
quite
critical
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
existence
of
one
almost
always
negates
the
existence
of
the
other.
to
illustrate
the
incompatibility,
i
might
refer
to
tuition
charges
as
state
university.
ordinarily,
the
fee
is
uniform
at
least
for
all
state
residents.
this
is
equality
of
treatment,
all
students
are
treated
alike,
yet
this
very
equality
of
treatment
clearly
produces
an
inequality
of
result
respecting
the
ability
of
indigent
and
affluent
students
to
enroll
in
the
university.
if
on
the
other
hand,
the
word
“indigent”
could
somehow
be
classified
and
students
falling
within
the
classification
were
permitted
to
attend
the
university
tuition
free,
there
would
obviously
be
at
least
a
movement
toward
equality
of
result.
this
would
require
of
course
a
total
absence
of
equality
of
treatment.
i
suppose
what
would
follow
would
be
suits
progressively
by
students
just
outside
the
classification
of
indigency
until
ultimately
may
be
everyone
will
go
free.
for
reasons
which
ought
to
be
obvious,
it
is
equality
of
treatment
rather
than
equality
of
result
which
prevails
in
the
legislatures
and
in
the
courts.
we
see
this
in
public
utility
charges,
public
transportation
and
admission
fees
and
charges
for
public
accommodations
generally.
these
fees
do
not
show
very
according
to
the
pocketbook
of
the
consumer.
sales,
taxes,
excise
taxes
and
automobile
license
plates
fall
upon
rich
and
poor
alike.
theft
is
not
excusable
because
the
thief
is
indigent
and
therefore
has
--
is
under
a
greater
pressure
to
steal
than
the
person
of
means.
and
as
we
think
we
show
in
our
brief
the
authorities
to
date
are
rather
uniform
in
holding
that
the
great
number
of
bonds
both
in
the
federal
system
and
state
system
which
are
required
in
some
situations
as
a
condition
of
holding
office
and
other
situations
as
a
condition
of
access
to
courts
are
not
to
be
pushed
aside
or
enforced
according
to
the
economic
means
of
the
person
require
to
post
the
bond.
it
is
this
traditional
test
which
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
applied
in
the
case
at
bar.
having
adopted
the
equality
of
treatment
view
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
georgia
supreme
court
could
hardly
have
concluded
other
then
that
there
was
simply
no
classification
based
upon
economic
means
which
existed.
the
sole
classification
which
did
exist
was
that
of
being
a
tenant
which
like
that
of
being
a
student
has
nothing
to
do
with
economic
status.
since
this
test
negates
the
existence
of
the
indigency
classification
upon
which
appellants
chiefly
rely
in
their
equal
protection
argument.
we
feel
they
simply
have
no
equal
protection
argument
at
all.
the
result
of
course
would
be
different
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
requiring
equality
of
results
rather
than
of
treatment.
if
equality
result
is
the
constitutional
goal,
they
will
have
to
be
inequality
of
treatment.
under
this
approach,
the
constitution
would
presumably
require
a
sliding
scale
for
bonds,
bail,
tuition
and
all
other
fees.
in
each
instance,
the
individual’s
economic
means
would
have
to
be
very
carefully
scrutinized
to
achieve
as
equal
a
result
as
possible.
carried
to
its
natural
conclusion,
i
suppose
that
the
equality
result
test
would
require
the
leveling
of
all
differences
attributable
to
economic
circumstance.
if
not
from
each
according
to
his
ability,
we
would
at
least
have
two
each
according
to
his
needs.
i
think
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
courts
like
the
legislatures
have
been
reluctant
to
so
convert
the
equal
protection
clause
into
a
socialist
manifesto.
the
equality
of
result
approaches
have
been
very
sparingly
used
by
the
legislatures.
one
example
might
be
progressive
income
tax;
another,
various
welfare
programs
and
some
educational
programs
which
are
specifically
designed
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
poor.
inarguably
judicial
example
would
be
this
court’s
line
of
cases
starting
in
griffin
versus
illinois
which
hold
that
indigent
prisoners
must
be
given
the
same
appellate
remedies
as
are
given
to
those
prisoners
who
are
not
indigent.
i
say
arguably
because
quite
candidly
i
really
believe
that
the
underlying
rational
of
these
cases
is
not
equal
protection,
but
it
is
due
process.
while
the
difficulties
of
the
equality
of
result
approach
is
that
it
would
require
highly
subjective
and
personal
evaluations
which
defines
upon
distinctions.
this
is
not
of
course
true
of
the
equality
treatment
approach
which
is
a
traditional
approach,
which
is
acceptable
of
an
objective
judgment.
all
we
can
do
this
court
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
classify
the
underlying
rational
is
due
process
and
i
recognized
that
in
the
courts
--
in
this
court
i’ll
have
to
say
also
in
many
of
these
cases
the
two
have
been
sort
of
lumped
together
and
they
have
not
been
perhaps
analyzed
separately.
but
i
would
classify
this
due
process.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
only
--
in
my
own
judgment,
the
only
substantial
constitutional
issue
in
the
boddie
case
is
due
process.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
not
necessarily,
that’s
a
due
process
question,
i
have
not
yet
come
to
due
process
that
in
court
of
course
requires
the
balancing
of
interest
and
i
don’t
know
if
the
interests
there
are
the
same
as
they
are
here.
in
fact
i
think
they
well
might
could
different.
moving
due
process
--
two
due
process,
we
come
to
one
of
the
more
unsettled
areas
of
constitutional
law.
from
her
of
view
of
this
court’s
decisions,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
majority
view
is
essentially
a
natural
law
concept
--
a
fundamental
fairness.
this
test
has
been
stated
in
terms
of
whether
the
attack
procedure
shocks
the
conscience
or
whether
it
runs
contrary
to
essential
principles
of
ordered
liberty.
but
of
course
important
questions
remain,
whose
conscience
must
be
shocked?
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
not
merely
the
subjective
view
of
the
justices
on
this
court
which
should
control.
if
one
looks
for
objective
standards,
is
it
not
highly
relevant
that
the
statutory
procedure
in
question
has
been
in
effect
and
very
greatly
relied
upon
in
georgia
for
over
140
years.
it
certainly
hasn’t
shock
too
many
consciences
over
the
past
to
140
years
when
it’s
only
now
under
attacked.
i
think
if
we
are
to
fairly
judge
the
essential
fairness
of
georgia’s
dispossessory
procedures,
we
must
look
at
these
procedures
in
the
light
of
history
and
also
in
the
light
of
the
totality
of
the
landlord
tenant
relationship.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
common
law
situation
was
basically
one
of
self-help.
the
landlord
was
ordinarily
permitted
to
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
physically
remove
the
tenant.
this
was
obviously
harsh.
this
is
not
to
say,
of
course,
that
the
tenant
was
without
remedy
for
a
wrongful
eviction
of
common
law.
he
could
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
he
could
bring
an
action
in
tort
for
wrongful
eviction
where
he
had
the
possibility
of
recovering
punitive
damages.
he
also
could
secure
equitable
relief
in
a
proper
case
involving
fraud.
i
hasten
to
add
that
indigency
alone
would
not
give
the
court
equitable
jurisdiction
but
it
could
have
equitable
jurisdiction,
it
could
enjoy
the
eviction
if
there
were
other
equitable
grounds
available
such
as
fraud.
now,
in
past
arguments,
appellants
have
conceded
that
georgia
could
retain
the
common
law
situation.
this
being
so
are
not
appellants
in
a
rather
strange
position
to
be
attacking
a
statutory
procedure.
the
principle
aim
in
effect
of
which
has
been
to
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
tenant
to
improve
his
condition
over
that
which
he
had
at
common
law.
in
addition
to
retaining
all
of
his
common
law
remedies,
the
tenant
gained
a
very
valuable
albeit
qualified
right
of
retaining
possession
of
someone
else’s
property
during
litigation
as
to
whether
he
had
any
rights
to
the
same.
moreover,
the
tenant
was
spared
the
self-help
injuries
inflicted
by
the
landlord.
the
statutory
procedure
terminated
this
valuable
right
of
the
landlord
to
use
such
force
as
was
necessary
to
eject
the
tenant.
the
heart
of
appellants’
due
process
claim
of
course
is
that
now
this
qualification
to
the
statutory
right
they
gained
must
also
be
eliminated
for
reason
that
it
forecloses
them
from
access
to
the
courts.
we
emphatically
deny
that
appellants
are
foreclosed
from
asserting
their
claimed
rights
by
the
bond
posting
requirement.
to
start
with,
appellants
whether
or
not
they
post
bond
retain
all
of
their
common
law
remedies.
they
can
still
sue
for
breach
of
contract.
they
can
still
bring
an
action
in
tort
for
wrongful
eviction
where
they
can
get
punitive
damages
and
in
a
proper
case,
they
can
secure
injunctive
relief
which
could
restrain
eviction.
additionally,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
denial
of
access
such
as
would
shock
the
conscience
where
the
principle
argument
is
the
indigency
of
the
particular
persons
involved
as
this
court
said
in
omb
versus
morgan
the
question
of
whether
a
security
condition
is
reasonable
depends
upon
its
general
effect
and
operation
not
upon
instances
of
peculiar
hardship
arising
out
of
exceptional
circumstances.
in
omb
which
snyder
act
very
recently
treated
as
being
constitutionally
viable,
the
contention
was
not
at
all
unlike
the
contention
made
here.
there,
a
defendant
in
a
foreign
attachment
action
had
its
pleading
stricken
when
he
was
unable
to
furnish
security
in
the
sum
of
$200,000.00
a
rather
substantial
sum.
it
was
contended
that
this
denial
of
his
right
to
appear
and
present
his
defenses
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
this
court
disagreed
saying
that
the
statute
expressly
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
that
the
security
condition
did
not
as
a
matter
of
law
take
away
his
right
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
he
attempted
to
but
was
unable
to
obtain
the
security.
this
court
in
cases
as
union
guano
and
also
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
has
consistently
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
state
from
proscribing
reasonable
and
appropriate
conditions
to
the
seeking
of
judicial
relief
in
specific
situations
so
long
as
first,
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real
and
second,
a
legitimate
governmental
end
is
served.
certainly,
the
situation
here
is
specific.
it
involves
purely
possessory
rights
in
only
three
specific
situations.
they
are,
where
the
tenant
has
failed
to
pay
rent,
where
the
tenant
is
holding
over
beyond
the
term
of
the
lease,
and
where
the
tenant
occupies
at
will
or
by
sufferance.
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
correctly
i
think
noted,
these
are
facts
which
are
or
ought
to
be
easily
within
the
knowledge
of
the
tenant
as
well
as
within
the
knowledge
of
the
landlord.
we
think
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
basis
of
the
distinction
is
real.
the
interest
involved
here
are
for
a
cry
from
those
presented
in
the
line
of
cases
such
as
griffin
ver
--
starting
with
griffin
versus
illinois
or
goldberg
versus
kelly.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
balancing
involved
was
the
balancing
of
the
rights
of
individuals
versus
an
interest
in
state
funds
--
safeguarding
state
funds.
under
the
circumstances
presented
in
those
cases
which
were
spelled
out
very
carefully,
this
court
opted
in
favor
of
the
individual.
this
is
not
a
conflict.
the
interests
here
are
not
state
versus
an
individual.
here,
it
is
the
clash
of
economic
interests
between
two
easily
identifiable
classes
of
private
citizens.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the,
admit
and
we
don’t
deny
the
hardship
of
dispossession.
there
is
he
admitted
personal
hardship
of
dispossession
on
one
hand
although
this
is
a
hardship
which
if
wrongfully
inflicted
ought
to
be
and
is
compensable
by
damages
including
in
a
tort
action
punitive
damages.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
danger
of
irreparable
injury
to
the
landlord
through
lost
rental
income.
in
most
cases,
this
lost
could
never
be
recovered
particularly
whereas
here
the
tenants
are
indigent.
this
question
is
to
whether
they
would
be
liable
for
double
damages
on
if
it
should
go
back,
it’s
really
an
academic
question,
they’re
indigent.
the
landlord
will
never
get
initial
damages
much
less
double
damages.
i
simply
can’t
understand
how
this
can
be
said
not
to
be
a
very
real
basis
of
distinction
where
you’re
weighing
the
interest
of
two
competing
groups
of
citizens.
finally,
we
submit
that
protection
of
property
from
irreparable
loss
is
a
legitimate
and
indeed
a
compelling
governmental
objective.
under
the
georgia
constitution,
i
think
under
the
constitution
of
most
states,
protection
of
person
and
property
is
one
of
the
fundamental
justifications
for
the
very
existence
of
any
government.
for
over
140
years,
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
has
accorded
a
very
high
degree
of
protection
to
the
owners
of
property
including
the
owners
of
rental
property.
through
the
bond
posting
requirement
of
its
dispossessory
proceedings,
it
is
in
the
absence
of
the
stipulation
to
the
contrary
a
part
of
the
lease
to
which
every
tenant
agrees
he
can
vary
it
by
contract.
if
standards
for
shocking
the
conscience
are
truly
objective,
i
fail
to
see
how
after
140
years
this
statute
is
suddenly
in
this
category
of
unconstitutionality.
frankly,
which
at
my
conscience
if
the
state
could
not
protect
the
owners
of
rental
property.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
a
very
difficult
question
mr.
justice
black
and
of
course
i'm
not
--
it’s
not
a
test
that
i
personally
think
as
a
good
one,
but
i
would
say
it
would
have
to
be
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
at
the
very
least
it
would
have
to
be
based
upon
the
general
view
of
society
which
conceivably
could
change.
but
i
do
think
it
would
have
to
be
based
on
a
general
view.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
sir?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
one
which
would
shock
the
conscience
of
civilized
society.
it
should
--
this
should
be
the
objective
standard
tort
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
says
the
court
should
move.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
hate
--
i
dislike
to
even
comment
on
the
testified
obscenity,
i
frankly
find
it
so
difficult
to
grasp.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
fundamental
fairness,
it
is
of
course
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
again,
where
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
interpret
the
phrases
as
being
identical
shocking
the
conscience
or
fundamental
fairness
to
me
means
the
same
thing.
if
i'm
using
histrionics
i
am
borrowing
at
from
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
say
that
again
you
should
look
it.
i
think
it
should
be
looked
for
in
what
is
the
consensus
of
civilized
society
of
our
longstanding
judicial
traditions.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
--
well
this
court
has
said
it
ought
not
to
be
merely
the
personal
view
of
any
individual
justice
who
seats
on
the
court
at
any
one
time
that
is
what
this
court
has
said.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
i'm
sure
it
is.
i
would
have
only
one
further
comment
and
that
is
on
the
double
bond
which
of
course,
i
agree
with
much
mr.
padnos
said
it
is
in
meshed
--
oh!
excuse
me
the
double
rent
provision
is
in
meshed
with
double
bond
in
effect.
the
only
thing
i
would
say
about
double
damages
is
that
305
which
was
attacked
deals
with
double
damages.
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
the
right
of
states
and
the
federal
government
for
that
matter
to
require
double
or
for
that
matter
trouble
damages
such
as
you
have
in
the
clayton
act
where
an
individual
can
be
oblige
to
pay
trouble
damages
even
for
unintentional
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
have
no
ready
answer
for
this
reason
as
i
believe
i
indicated
that
these
cases
have
not
followed
the
statutory
procedure.
now,
if
they’re
going
to
revert
to
the
statutory
procedure
is
something
i
do
not
know.
i
think,
in
fact
no
double
damages
ever
could
possibly
be
recovered
because
they
are
indigents.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
you
see
the
problem
is
the
court
deviated
from
the
statute
in
having
the
rent
paid
into
the
registry
of
court.
now,
whether
this
would
cause
an
equitable
reply
to
any
assertion
for
double
damages
i
assume
it
would.
certainly,
they
--
certainly
i
think
there
could
be
no
recovery
for
double
damages
for
the
entire
period
of
the
litigation
when
pursuant
to
court
order,
the
rent
has
been
paid
into
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
certainly,
from
that
time
there
could
be
no
double
damages
and
i
think
there
if
there
are
double
damages
if
there
are
none,
not
at
all
certain
it
could,
i
don’t
know
how,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
i
don’t
know
how
the
courts
would
handle
it
because
they
departed
so
far
from
the
statute
to
date
in
this
problem
that
i
don’t
know
how
or
when
or
why
or
if
they
would
go
back.
and
i'm
sorry
i
can’t
help
on
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
both
cases
the
tenant
is
out
of
possession.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
bond
question
is
washed
out
of
the
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
again
it
is
presumably
if
this
court
for
example
were
to
rule
on
the
merits,
i
don’t
know
it
might
be
that
being
as
the
court
might
construe
this
to
the
best
of
rights
and
it
might
be
going
back
to
trial
court
assuming
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
affirmed,
the
trial
court
might
well
take
the
position
that
well
i
guess
they
can’t
come,
i
think
it
[voice
overlap].
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
there
really
isn’t.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
i’m
saying
that
assuming
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
if
the
landlord
state
they
will
not
push
for
it,
but
obviously
this
would
ended.
i'm
assuming
if
the
landlords
attempted
to,
i
think
it’s
very
unlikely
they
would
attempt
to.
if
they
attempted
to,
i
don’t
know
what
the
courts
will
do.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
--
the
court
has
departed
from
the
statutory
procedure
in
these
cases.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
not
this
particular
matter.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
speak
for
the
landlords
of
the
states
a
whole
but
not
this
particular
instance.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
