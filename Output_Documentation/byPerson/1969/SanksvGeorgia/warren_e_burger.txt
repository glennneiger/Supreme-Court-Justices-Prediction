well,
have
they
ever
expressed
that
in
terms
of
the
apparent
equity
power
of
the
court?
chief

warren
e.

there's
none
in
georgia.
no
equity

in

whole
civil

chief

e.

you
have
a
separate
equity
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
been
expressed
this
mechanism
in
terms
of
inherent
judicial
power?
i
suppose
they
must
have
had
something
like
that
in
mind
if
they
were
accepting
it.
chief

warren
e.
burger
or
was
it
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
where
no
judicial
discussion
was
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
way
equity
developed
in
the
first
place,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
having
an
ambivalent
position
on
that.
you
first
suggested
that
you
thought
it
would
ask
of
--
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
next
session
you
got,
it
would
pass?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
used
that
theory
to
define
an
adversary
proceeding,
then
no
case
in
which
to
go
up
judgment
represented.
it
would
be
an
adversary
case
that
they
really
are,
aren't
they?
the
default
case
is
much
adversary
is
a
contested
one
who
in
terms
of
the
potential.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
here,
the
affidavit
is
accepted
as
the
proof.
i
would
assume
the
rationale
of
that
is
that
if
the
man
filed
the
false
affidavit
in
a
dispossessory
action,
he'd
be
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
it
help
you
much
to
describe
this
as
a
non
adversary
proceeding
at
the
early
stage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
soon
as
he
wants
to
assert
a
right,
then
he
must
--
then
he
converts
it
into
an
adversary
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
dispossess
for
other
than
holding
over
or
non
payment
of
rent
supposed
damage
and
waste
to
the
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
it
is
another
civil
action,
would
it?
chief

warren
e.

mr.

e.

well

the

us
say
in
the
form
of

within
48

you'd
have
almost
the
same
kind
of
summary
procedure
that
you
got
here,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you're
not
challenging
the
right
of
the
state
that
you
have
the
statute
which
calls
for,
permits
the
summary
disposition
of
such
a
case.
chief

warren
e.

would
you
think
that
georgia
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
require
a
condition
for
the
relief
you
seek,
the
payment
in
the
court
of
all
rent
then
overdue
and
monthly
payments
during
dependency
of
the
appeal?
chief

e.

now
what
the
georgia
legislature
at
least
arguably
has
done
is
make
an
estimate
that
double
the
rent
will
accomplish
that

objective.
is
that
inaccurate?
chief

you

one
is
all
right
that
the

is
not?
chief

until

can

it

mr.

ordinarily,
we’re
not

we
approach
it
very
narrowly
and
decide
only
what
must
be
decided.
chief

e.

would
that
make
it
something
like
the
test
we
apply

chief

e.

i
won’t
pressure
you
for
answering
that
one.
chief

it

they
paid

chief

you

chief

mr.

would
you

it’s

have
been
complicated
somewhat

the
fact
trial
judge
initially

intended
to
stretch

considerably?
in
another
words,
by
calling
for
the
payment

these
circumstances
in

of

he
was
really
ignoring
the
statute,
wasn’t
he?
chief

e.

in

that
does
have
an
impact
on
this
case
as
distinguished
from
the
functioning
of
that

chief

so,
that
makes
it
an
atypical
case
under
the
statute?
chief

thank
you
mr.

now,
you’ll
