mr.
stahl,
what
about
the
union
contract
that
applies
greek
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
my
understanding
of
mr.
estabrook's
argument.
his
argument
is
that
once
the
court
took
jurisdiction,
it
was
bound
by
the
greek
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
his
point.
can
you
give
me
your
answer
to
that
specific
point?
once
the
court
takes
jurisdiction,
it
should
apply
the
greek
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
estabrook,
are
they
part
of
the
reason
for
the
large
number
of
greek
seaman
be
the
factor
that
there
are
cheaper
labor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
the
standard
wages
for
greek
seamen
equal
to
that
of
the
united
states,
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we're
dealing
with
the
united
states
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
he
pay
taxes
in
greece?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
he
pay
on
these
insurance
policies
over
there,
working
compensation
clauses,
or
do
the
seamen
pay
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
the
seamen
pay
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
well,
that's
not
involved
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
agree
that
he
will
end
up
with
a
$160.00
he
got
if
he
went
back
to
greece?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
165?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
gets
paid
while
he's
working?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
working
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
would
he
get
now?
$260.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
know
how
much
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
i
assume
from
the
fact
that
you're
defending
this
case
that
there
would
be
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
