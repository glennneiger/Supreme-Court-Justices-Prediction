mr.
james
m.
estabrook
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
herein
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit.
george
wood,
the
original
counsel
of
record
who
tried
this
case
in
mobile
and
who
argued
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
very
sorry
he's
unable
to
be
here.
he
called
me
about
two
weeks
ago
and
said
he
had
the
recurrence
of
a
heart
condition,
asked
me
if
i
could
possibly
argue.
i
agreed.
i
was
hoping
to
see
him
here
but
unfortunately
his
brother
passed
away
on
saturday
right
after
a
golf
game
and
george
was
unable
to
attend.
i
represent
not
only
the
petitioners
herein
but
i
also
submitted
a
brief
amicus
for
the
royal
greek
government.
as
i
said
before
this
is
an
appeal
--
a
petition
for
certiorari
by
hellenic
lines
limited
and
universal
cargo
carriers
from
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirming
an
admiralty
decree
in
the
southern
district
of
alabama
southern
division
in
favor
of
the
libellant
below
the
respondent
here.
the
accident
occurred
august
3,
1965
in
a
libel
in
rem
and
in
personam
was
filed
august
13,
1965.
so
the
case
came
up
under
the
old
admiralty
rules.
briefly,
the
facts
which
are
pertinent
are
that
rhoditis,
the
libellant
below
and
the
respondent
here
was
a
greek
seaman
with
a
wife
and
two
children
in
greece.
he
is
a
resident
of
greece.
he
joined
the
greek
flag
motorship
hellenic
hero
in
heraklion
crete.
he
signed
the
standard
greek
articles.
while
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
contained
in
the
findings
and
conclusions
stated
he
is
illiterate.
he
is
practically
illiterate
in
english.
the
record
is
disclosing
that
he
can
read
and
write
only
figures
and
write
only
his
address
in
english
but
that
he
can
read
and
write
greek
since
he
can
write
letters
to
his
wife
and
he
can
read
greek.
the
hellenic
hero,
a
greek
flag
vessel
was
sailing
in
the
united
states,
india,
pakistan
trade.
at
the
time
the
depositions
herein
were
taken,
the
suez
canal
was
either
open
or
had
just
been
closed.
now,
this
trade
through
suez
no
longer
exists.
the
practical
difference,
however,
is
this
that
whereas
in
--
when
the
depositions
were
taken
and
on
the
record
it
appears
that
hellenic
lines
had
20
ships,
24
ships
sailing
out
of
new
york
and
u.s.
ports
and
only
12
ships
out
of
european
ports
based
on
pireas
at
present.
the
american-based
ships
are
down
to
20
and
the
european
ships
are
up
to
19.
the
--
also
there
is
some
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
of
course
it
does.
the
demands
of
this
case
happened
to
be
away
from
the
american
trade
and
in
favor
to
foreign
trade
also
there
while
the
report,
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
trial
judge
stated
there
was
no
intermediate
traffic
at
present
time,
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
trade
between
intermediate
ports
particularly
between
the
indian,
pakistan
ports
and
south
africa.
briefly,
the
acts
did
occur
in
this
manner.
as
the
hellenic
hero
was
tying
up,
and
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
show
how
the
acts
had
really
involves
only
the
people
of
the
ship,
he
was
tying
up
in
new
orleans.
they
have
the
lines
opened
and
the
spring
line
or
a
line
leading
from
the
bow
aft
not
directly
to
dock
but
aft
to
keep
the
ship
from
surging
ahead
was
being
secured
where
that
is
working
up
in
the
bow.
this
spring
line
was
secured
around
the
winch
and
they
had
been
taking
the
strain
on
it
and
when
they
are
going
to
tie
the
ship
up,
they
had
to
take
this
line
which
is
a
heavy
wire
rope
off
the
winch
drum
and
bend
it
around
bollards
which
are
two
iron
columns
about
three
feet
high
and
about
three
feet
apart
like
two
fourplex
and
you
bend
this
wire
around
the
bollards
making
about
eight
--
figure
eights
and
that's
how
you
secure
the
ship.
but
when
you
take
the
wire
off
the
winch
drum,
it's
necessary
to
secure
it
by
a
small
piece
of
chain
which
the
interpreter
and
the
record
referred
to
as
a
keeper.
actually
the
correct
term
is
stopper
and
you
take
the
slide
chain
and
you
wind
it
around
the
wire
tying
some
knots
on
it
and
that
will
take
the
strain
off
the
wire
in
the
drum
because
the
end
of
the
chain
is
secured
to
the
bits.
then
with
the
strain
off
the
wire
and
the
drum,
you
can
loosen
the
wire
on
the
drum
and
put
it
on
the
bits.
well,
they
did
that.
they
--
the
stopper
or
keeper
looked
new,
looked
to
be
in
good
condition.
they
put
it
on.
they
took
the
wire
off
the
drum
and
they
were
putting
it
on
the
bits
and
as
they
were
putting
it
the
second
turn,
the
chain
suddenly
broke
as
the
engines
of
the
ship
went
ahead.
that's
the
testimony.
why
they
went
ahead,
nobody
knows,
but
of
course
that
would
put
extra
strain
and
the
line
leading
aft
extra
strain
on
the
chain.
the
chain
broke
and
the
piece
of
a
chain
struck
rhoditis
in
the
leg.
rhoditis
was
then
taken
to
a
hospital
in
new
orleans
after
his
first
cast
was
removed.
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
travel,
he
was
moved
to
greece
and
he
was
able
to
return
to
work
according
to
the
trial
court
the
next
march.
hellenic
lines,
the
employer
is
a
greek
corporation.
it
had
in
its
employ
some
1100
seamen.
it
paid
taxes
last
year
of
over
$5
million
to
greece.
some
old
repair
bills
were
paid
to
greece
of
about
the
same
amount.
it,
however,
did
have
a
new
york
office
and
in
the
new
york
office,
the
record
shows
it
employed
between
75
to
100
people
depending
on
whether
it
appeared
to
the
testimony.
it
has
a
new
orleans
office,
10
to
15
people
and
the
pireas
office
of
70
to
75.
if
you
disregard
the
seaman,
then
you
do
have
more
people
employed
in
the
offices
in
new
york
than
in
greece
but
if
you
take
the
seaman
into
account
and
they
are
all
greeks
then
you
have
a
pronounced
greek
flavor
to
the
company.
there
are
also
some
longshoremen
employed
in
new
york
,
stevedores,
but
we
also
have
longshoremen
abroad
and
actually
you
employ
a
lot
more
longshoremen
abroad
than
you
do
in
this
country
because
you
have
better
machinery
in
this
country.
so
in
any
international
run,
you
tend
to
have
more
longshoremen
than
the
other
side.
we
believe
this
--
however
there
are
some
american
features
the
operation.
the
substantial
part
of
hellenic
heroes
trade
is
to
and
from
the
united
states.
while
hellenic
lines
is
a
greek
corporation,
the
majority
stockholder
and
the
principal
executive
officer
or
general
manager
of
the
company
is
a
resident
of
the
united
states
although
a
citizen
of
greece.
we
have
in
our
brief
for
the
petitioner
and
the
record
indicates
he
received
several
honors
from
the
kingdom
of
greece.
we
are
not
claiming
sovereign
immunity,
diplomatic
immunity
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
callimanopoulos
has
been
of
assistance,
the
greek
mission.
he
is
receiving
official
greek
passport
from
time
to
time
and
the
purpose
of
this
proof
in
the
record
is
to
show
his
allegiance
to
greece.
he
is
a
bona
fide
greek
citizen.
he
performs
duties
to
the
greek
government.
we
believe
this
case
comes
squarely
under
the
doctrine
of
larsen
against
lauritzen
because
both
these
cases
emphasized
two
things,
the
primacy
of
the
flag,
that
is
very
important.
the
flag
of
a
ship
should
determine
the
law
applicable
to
the
ship
and
also
the
fact
that
it's
important
that
there
will
be
an
available
forum.
there
is
an
available
forum
in
this
case.
mr.
rhoditis
can
pursue
his
claim
for
compensation
in
greece,
and
there
we
must
pay
him
under
greek
law
and
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
fact,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
specifies
particularly
the
adoption
of
greek
law
and
this
is
very
similar
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
followed
by
this
court
in
larsen
against
lauritzen
which
provided
for
determination
of
disputes
in
denmark.
the
--
in
larsen
against
lauritzen,
we
had
an
accident
in
havana
where
the
ship
sailing
between
united
states
and
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
both
--
that
ship
never
did
go
to
denmark
in
a
regular
trade.
both
vessels
had
crews
of
substantially
crews
of
the
citizenship
of
the
flag.
they
--
the
randa
did
have
a
few
chileans
but
all
the
officers
and
most
of
the
crew
were
danes.
in
both
cases,
the
--
we
claim
the
place
of
the
acts
in
this
is
unimportant.
in
the
randa
the
man
was
injured
in
havana
yet
he
was
brought
to
the
united
states
for
medical
treatment
and
he
remained.
larsen
actually
remained
in
the
united
states
until
he
was
able
to
sail
again,
so
the
medical
testimony
was
readily
available
here
yet
the
court
held
that
jones
act
did
apply.
in
both
cases,
the
court
was
based
for
the
seaman
who
was
engaged
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
negotiated
with
the
assistance
of
the
national
union
and
the
national
association
of
shipowners.
we
the
petitioner
here
and
the
greek
government
are
both
very
much
opposed
to
the
"runaway
flag".
insofar
as
the
respondent
and
his
amici
argue
against
the
runaway
flag
were
or
in
fully
in
a
court.
we
believe
that
argument
is
solved
but
we
say
it
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
our
position
is
that
as
stated
in
the
larsen
case
and
quoted
in
my
brief
amicus,
"each
state
under
international
law"
it's
page
3
"may
determine
for
itself
the
conditions
upon
which
you
can
grant
us
nationality
to
a
merchant
ship
thereby
accepting
responsibility
for
it
and
acquiring
authority
over
it.
we
believe
that
the
phrase
"accepting
responsibility"
is
important.
if
a
nation
does
not
accept
responsibility
for
its
merchant
ships
then
that
you
have
a
runaway
flag
situation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
can
--
it
still
subsists,
that
was
--
we
have
the
same
thing
in
tsakonites,
your
honor.
tsakonites
brought
his
case
up
in
the
second
circuit.
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
thereupon
tsakonites
commenced
proceedings
in
the
greek
court
and
recovered
and
that
is
exhibit
a
on
the
greek
government's
brief.
if
you
don't
accept
responsibility
for
a
ship
then
you
have
true
runaway
flag.
for
instance,
you
may
have
a
ship
under
say
panamanian
or
liberian
registry
with
a
cayman
island
crew,
norwegian
officers
and
spanish
engineers.
you
don't
have
the
regular
inspection
that
we
have.
the
greek
government
insists
on
regular
inspections
of
the
ship,
regular
surveys.
it
insists
on
greek
ownership.
if
you
have
a
foreign
corporation
owning
a
greek
ship
then
does
exists
here
then
the
technical
ownership
was
in
universal
cargo
carriers,
a
panamanian
corporation
but
the
ship
was
in
fact
operated
by
hellenic
who
hired
the
crew
then
you
must
under
greek
law
have
an
agent
in
greece
who
can
make
the
reports
necessary.
you
must
have
the
ship
under
the
greek
flag.
i
mean
you
do
have
a
--
you
must
also
have
a
greek
crew.
you
must
have
greek
officers.
you
have
a
pension
plan
in
greece
known
as
nat
capital
n,
capital
a,
capital
t
to
which
all
greek
seamen
must
contribute.
to
this
doctrine
of
recognizing
responsible
flags
has
been
followed
by
this
court
not
only
larsen
against
lauritzen
in
1953
but
again
in
1959,
in
romero
case
where
a
spanish
seaman
was
injured
on
a
spanish
ship
in
the
port
of
new
york,
the
court
held
that
spanish
laws
should
and
not
the
jones
act.
a
similar
case
in
mcculloch
against
honduran
union
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
not
apply
to
honduran
flag
ships
with
honduran
crews
operated
by
honduran
corporations
between
new
york
and
honduras
even
though
the
honduran
corporations
were
subsidiaries
of
an
american
corporation.
the
--
they
recognized
the
law
of
the
flag
as
being
a
responsible
flag
for
the
reason
that
these
honduran
ships
were
actually
meant
by
hondurans
and
they
had
honduran
officers.
the
background
being
of
course
that
these
ships
were
carrying
bananas
and
one
of
the
conditions
for
granting
banana
concessions,
the
fruit
company
would
be
that
bona
fide
honduran
ships
would
be
used
to
transport
bananas
and
while
the
ultimate
directions
of
these
ships
is
in
the
united
states,
the
allegiance
of
the
owner,
a
honduran
corporation
was
to
the
republic
of
honduras.
for
that
reason
when
the
court
declined
to
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
my
problem,
your
honor,
is
based
on
the
statute,
the
jones
act
and
possibly
on
the
general
maritime
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
the
jones
act,
your
honor,
provides
has
been
interpreted
as
applying
not
to
the
rights
of
foreign
crews
on
foreign
ships
but
to
the
rights
of
american
seamen
on
american
ships.
but
the
jones
act
and
this
court
was
held
not
apply
to
the
rights
of
a
danish
seaman
on
a
danish
ship
in
lauritzen
against
larsen
or
to
the
rights
of
a
spanish
seaman
on
a
spanish
ship
in
romero
against
international
terminal
operating
corporation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
sir.
there's
no
question
of
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there
are
jurisdiction
in
rem
and
in
personam,
yes
your
honor.
this
was
in
admiralty.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
the
jones
act
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
jones
act,
your
honor
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
19
--
it
does,
there's
in
the
statute.
now,
i
brief
this
point
thoroughly
in
my
randall,
larsen
--
lauritzen
against
larsen
case.
the
jones
act
is
section
20
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920.
certain
sections
of
that
act
specifically
apply
to
foreign
ships.
i'm
talking
primarily
about
the
provision
against
advances
that
applies
to
foreign
ships
as
well
as
to
american
ships
and
so
states
in
the
statute.
there's
another
section,
the
so-called
penalty
wage
statute
that
specifically
applies
to
foreign
vessels.
that
requires
a
shipowner
to
pay
half
earned
wages
in
an
intermediate
port
and
all
of
the
earned
wages
within
four
days
after
arriving
from
a
foreign
voyage
at
the
port
of
destination.
now,
the
history
is
rather
interesting.
when
those
two
sections
were
originally
enacted,
i
believe
it
was
the
shipping
act
of
1916
or
maybe
a
little
earlier.
they
were
in
general
terms
such
as
the
jones
act.
the
courts
construe
both
those
sections
in
the
first
instance
as
not
applying
either
to
advances
made
in
a
foreign
port
or
to
foreign
ships.
at
that
point,
both
sections
were
amended
specifically
to
apply
foreign
vessels.
consequently,
cases
like
strathearn
against
dillon
read
that
the
congress
had
the
power
to
apply
a
statute
to
foreign
vessels
but
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
to
apply
statutes
as
to
pay
and
as
permitting
advances
to
foreign
vessels
but
unless
it
specifically
applies
to
foreign
vessels
then
they
shouldn't
be
construed
so
as
to
apply
the
foreign
vessels
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
other
sections
of
the
shipping
act
refer
to
the
rights
of
any
shipowner
who
call
in
american
consul
in
a
foreign
port
must
submit
disputes
in
a
foreign
port.
well,
obviously,
you
wouldn't
expect
the
british
or
japanese
or
greek
ship
to
see
an
american
consul
in
london.
he'd
go
to
his
own
consul
if
he
had
trouble.
so
the
statute,
the
jones
act
has
been
construed
as
not
applying
to
foreign
crews
despite
the
broadness
of
the
terms
and
this
construction
of
the
jones
act
in
the
larsen
case
of
1953
was
followed
by
the
romero
case
is
1959
and
yet
congress
did
nothing
to
amend
the
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
decision
of
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
what?
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i'm
relying
--
i'm
relying
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
i'm
relying
basically
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
statute.
i'm
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
apply.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
i
was
--
i
was
afraid
you
might
ask
me
for
the
words
of
the
statute
i
was
relying
on
and
there
aren't
any.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there
aren't
any
words
mr.
justice
black
but
the
words
i
rely
on
are
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
no
question.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
it
should
be
governed
by
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
this
is
an
act
of
internal
management
of
a
greek
ship.
i
think
the
court
will
be
better
advised
to
decline
jurisdiction.
most
of
our
courts
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
situation
like
this
actually
declined
jurisdiction
on
the
condition
that
the
shipowner
appear
in
the
forum
of
its
native
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
we
have
that
in
o'neil
against
cunard
your
honor
where
i
believe
a
resident
of
the
united
states
was
injured
on
a
british
ship
and
the
court
declined
jurisdiction.
he
was
not
permitted
to
sue
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
my
recollection
is
that
they
said
the
jones
act
did
not
apply
and
since
the
man
was
insisting
in
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
on
that
point,
my
argument
is
based
in
the
committee
of
nations
and
the
application
of
the
greek
law.
i
say
that
neither
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
has
applied
the
internal
management
of
the
ships
nor
the
jones
act
is
applicable.
this
man's
rights
should
be
bound
under
the
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
in
that
case
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
courts
have
tried
the
cases.
that's
the
old
case
i
think
of
gambera
against
bergoty
and
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
is
a
correct
decision.
if
we
don't
have
a
convenient
forum
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
justice
clark
on
television
on
a
sunday,
one
of
the
big
injustices
is
delay
and
if
we
don't
have
a
convenient
forum
and
the
man
cannot
get
a
proper
decision
in
one
place,
he
should
get
it
in
another.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
think
so
but
i
think
it
should
also
apply
the
greek
law.
i
think
they've
applied
the
wrong
law.
they
applied
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
and
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
this
--
our
particular
case,
it
does
this
injury.
if
that
--
if
a
seaman
is
repaid
greater
to
greece
under
greek
law
he
gets
his
remedy
right
away
and
he
goes
ahead
and
if
he
goes
into
the
office
with
a
medical
certificate,
he
gets
his
money
and
the
existence
of
the
suit
in
this
country
is
not
a
defense.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
this
case,
he
very
likely
could
because
this
remedy
in
this
country
is
rather
small
when
you
consider
the
seriousness
of
the
injuries
and
when
you
consider
that
he
got
i
believe
$6,000.00
in
this
country
and
that's
all
he
gets,
he
can't
go
back.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he's
sailing
in
big
ships
out
of
greece.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
he
returned
to
greece
in
about
a
month
after
the
accident.
he
was
repatriated
to
greece
and
at
any
time
after
september,
i
believe,
he
could
have
started
this
action,
this
proceeding
in
greece
and
in
fact
he
got
some
money
in
greece
when
he
first
got
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
the
greek
law
is
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
because
first
of
all,
you
have
a
question
of
congestion
in
the
courts
and
the
second
place,
the
greek
remedy
is
similar
to
workman's
compensation.
it's
very
similar.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i'm
arguing
that
the
greeks
think
the
greek
remedy
is
better
and
the
greeks
have
provided
the
greek
remedy
for
greek
seamen
somewhat
a
workman's
compensation
with
punitive
damages
in
the
event
there's
a
violation
of
the
safety
law
or
a
safety
regulation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
doubt
it
very
much.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
but
i'm
saying
that
he
has
--
by
greek
rights
an
adequate
remedy
in
greece
as
provided
for
by
greek
law
and
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
accordance
with
larsen
against
lauritzen,
in
accordance
with
the
romero
case,
the
correct
law
to
be
applied
is
the
greek
law
and
under
the
greek
law,
he
will
get
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
i
believe
in
circumstances
where
you
have
a
seaman
on
--
injured
on
a
ship
which
is
a
bona
fide
foreign
flag
operator.
in
other
words,
the
country
of
the
flag
has
responsibility
for
the
ship
that
it
cruise
the
ship,
it
supervises
the
ship
and
where
there's
a
forum
readily
available,
then
i
believe
it
will
be
better
for
these
--
our
courts
that
decline
jurisdiction
and
in
any
event,
this
decision
below
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
but
i
say
this
decision
is
wrong
because
they
did
apply
united
states
law
not
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
there's
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
actually
there's
not
too
serious
a
danger.
that
there's
a
danger
some
double
liability
because
i
believe
he
collected
$140.00
in
greece
before
pireas
was
advised
of
the
existence
of
the
suit
in
this
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
then
they
--
then
they
stopped
paying,
yes.
because
he
had
--
this
is
a
technical
violation
of
the
articles.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes
they
did.
if
the
jones
act
expressly
applied
to
foreign
flag
vessels
sailing
in
american
waters,
then
a
number
of
sections
of
the
jones
act
specifically
invalidate
any
contractual
exemption
from
the
act.
there
is
a
section
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
is
incorporated
in
reference
by
the
jones
act
which
makes
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
act
by
contract
invalid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that
would
be
valid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
basis
but
this
principle
basis
of
my
argument
is
this
case
comes
squarely
under
larsen
--
lauritzen
against
larsen
and
romero.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right,
it
is.
and
lauritzen
against
larsen
so
states.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
he
can
get
--
he
can
get
more
money
quicker.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
but
sometimes
if
you
have
an
accident
like
this,
this
act
could
flare
up
later,
you
can
lose
in
the
long
run.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
think
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
none
of
the
courts
below
considered
at
all
the
number
of
greek
seamen
on
these
ships.
there
are
over
1100
seamen
to
back
up
our
point
that
this
is
a
bona
fide
greek
operation.
we
also
have
another
resting
opinion
from
judge
hoffman
in
virginia
which
is
the
next
to
the
supplemental
brief
which
he
goes
in
great
detail
to
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
on
the
application
of
the
contract
restrictions
to
determine
the
law
to
be
applied
and
finally,
we
have
the
fact
that
mr.
callimanopoulos,
he
may
be
a
binnacle,
but
he's
a
fair
paying
binnacle.
as
a
domiciliary,
he
is
required
to
pay
income
taxes
here
and
he
isn't
trying
to
avoid
any
of
his
american
obligations.
he
has
obligations
to
america,
and
to
greece
and
as
far
as
his
allegiance
to
greece
is
concerned,
he
is
a
citizen
of
greece
and
the
larsen
case
definitely
stated,
it
was
the
allegiance
of
the
shipowner
that
should
be
considered
as
one
of
the
primary
points.
his
allegiance
was
to
greece.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
one
--
one
of
the
points,
things
your
honor,
there
are
over
100,000
greek
seamen
and
one
of
the
largest
groups
of
seamen
in
the
world
and
i
think
the
principal
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
of
course
not.
it
is
higher
though
than
say
spanish
seamen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
it
is
lower
and
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
pays
on
--
he
pays
that
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
seamen
--
no,
the
seamen
contribute
and
he
contributes
to
a
seaman's
pension
fund,
nat,
n-a-t.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
that's
not
involved
here.
this
--
this
man
is
getting
his
nat
and
he
will
get
his
nat
when
he
retires.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he'll
get
more
than
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no.
he
was
just
disabled
for
i
think
seven
months.
he
got
40
pounds
a
month.
he'd
probably
get
$500.00
or
$600.00
as
wages,
he'd
get
medical
but
the
most
important
thing
he'd
get
in
greece
would
be
that
this
should
reactivate
itself.
he
would
then
get
further
medical
attention
and
a
further
payment
along
the
lines
of
workman's
compensation.
the
greek
law
is
actually
designed
to
be
similar
like
the
new
york
state
workman's
comp.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
gets
paid
while
he's
disabled.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he's
working
now.
he
won't
get
paid
if
a
thing
should
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
he'd
get
more
than
that.
he
got
paid
once.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
don't
know
how
much
more
and
if
there's
any
--
i
don't
--
this
court
found
no
disability
so
he'd
get
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
we're
defending
this
case
because
as
a
matter
of
principle
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
--
he'd
get
more.
i
can
assure
you
that
as
far
as
this,
if
it
were
not
for
the
principle
involved,
this
case
would
never
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
on
this
ship,
yes.
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
in
fact
the
mcculloch
case
says
it
is
the
same.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
all
of
the
stock
of
which
is
owned
by
a
greek
corporation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
a
greek
citizen
domiciled
in
this
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
--
yes,
that
follows
the
argument
in
the
mcculloch.
now,
in
larsen
against
lauritzen,
the
allegiance
of
the
owner,
the
fact
the
owner
is
a
greek
citizen
is
important
and
the
same
way
in
the
romero
case
which
followed
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
say
there
are
many
flags
of
convenience
but
this
isn't
one
of
them.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
of
the
fact
the
greek
government
is
responsible
for
the
good
order
and
maintenance
of
the
ship.
they
have
a
greek
crew
on
board
this
ship.
they
have
greek
licensed
officers.
they
have
greek
inspections.
this
is
a
bona
fide
greek
operation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
no.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
your
honor.
the
greek
law
set
forth
in
my
brief
requires
over
50%
of
the
stock
ownership
of
a
corporation
with
a
greek
flag
ship
being
greek.
that's
right
in
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
and
is
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
i
will
say
that
99%
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
will
say
that
99%
was
owned
by
one
man
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
a
greek
citizen
with
allegiance
to
greece.
he's
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
he
does.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
but
he
is
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
under
the
jones
act,
it
would
not
be
valid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there's
a
specific
provision
of
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
herein
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit.
george
wood,
the
original
counsel
of
record
who
tried
this
case
in
mobile
and
who
argued
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
is
very
sorry
he's
unable
to
be
here.
he
called
me
about
two
weeks
ago
and
said
he
had
the
recurrence
of
a
heart
condition,
asked
me
if
i
could
possibly
argue.
i
agreed.
i
was
hoping
to
see
him
here
but
unfortunately
his
brother
passed
away
on
saturday
right
after
a
golf
game
and
george
was
unable
to
attend.
i
represent
not
only
the
petitioners
herein
but
i
also
submitted
a
brief
amicus
for
the
royal
greek
government.
as
i
said
before
this
is
an
appeal
--
a
petition
for
certiorari
by
hellenic
lines
limited
and
universal
cargo
carriers
from
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirming
an
admiralty
decree
in
the
southern
district
of
alabama
southern
division
in
favor
of
the
libellant
below
the
respondent
here.
the
accident
occurred
august
3,
1965
in
a
libel
in
rem
and
in
personam
was
filed
august
13,
1965.
so
the
case
came
up
under
the
old
admiralty
rules.
briefly,
the
facts
which
are
pertinent
are
that
rhoditis,
the
libellant
below
and
the
respondent
here
was
a
greek
seaman
with
a
wife
and
two
children
in
greece.
he
is
a
resident
of
greece.
he
joined
the
greek
flag
motorship
hellenic
hero
in
heraklion
crete.
he
signed
the
standard
greek
articles.
while
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
contained
in
the
findings
and
conclusions
stated
he
is
illiterate.
he
is
practically
illiterate
in
english.
the
record
is
disclosing
that
he
can
read
and
write
only
figures
and
write
only
his
address
in
english
but
that
he
can
read
and
write
greek
since
he
can
write
letters
to
his
wife
and
he
can
read
greek.
the
hellenic
hero,
a
greek
flag
vessel
was
sailing
in
the
united
states,
india,
pakistan
trade.
at
the
time
the
depositions
herein
were
taken,
the
suez
canal
was
either
open
or
had
just
been
closed.
now,
this
trade
through
suez
no
longer
exists.
the
practical
difference,
however,
is
this
that
whereas
in
--
when
the
depositions
were
taken
and
on
the
record
it
appears
that
hellenic
lines
had
20
ships,
24
ships
sailing
out
of
new
york
and
u.s.
ports
and
only
12
ships
out
of
european
ports
based
on
pireas
at
present.
the
american-based
ships
are
down
to
20
and
the
european
ships
are
up
to
19.
the
--
also
there
is
some
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
of
course
it
does.
the
demands
of
this
case
happened
to
be
away
from
the
american
trade
and
in
favor
to
foreign
trade
also
there
while
the
report,
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
trial
judge
stated
there
was
no
intermediate
traffic
at
present
time,
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
trade
between
intermediate
ports
particularly
between
the
indian,
pakistan
ports
and
south
africa.
briefly,
the
acts
did
occur
in
this
manner.
as
the
hellenic
hero
was
tying
up,
and
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
show
how
the
acts
had
really
involves
only
the
people
of
the
ship,
he
was
tying
up
in
new
orleans.
they
have
the
lines
opened
and
the
spring
line
or
a
line
leading
from
the
bow
aft
not
directly
to
dock
but
aft
to
keep
the
ship
from
surging
ahead
was
being
secured
where
that
is
working
up
in
the
bow.
this
spring
line
was
secured
around
the
winch
and
they
had
been
taking
the
strain
on
it
and
when
they
are
going
to
tie
the
ship
up,
they
had
to
take
this
line
which
is
a
heavy
wire
rope
off
the
winch
drum
and
bend
it
around
bollards
which
are
two
iron
columns
about
three
feet
high
and
about
three
feet
apart
like
two
fourplex
and
you
bend
this
wire
around
the
bollards
making
about
eight
--
figure
eights
and
that's
how
you
secure
the
ship.
but
when
you
take
the
wire
off
the
winch
drum,
it's
necessary
to
secure
it
by
a
small
piece
of
chain
which
the
interpreter
and
the
record
referred
to
as
a
keeper.
actually
the
correct
term
is
stopper
and
you
take
the
slide
chain
and
you
wind
it
around
the
wire
tying
some
knots
on
it
and
that
will
take
the
strain
off
the
wire
in
the
drum
because
the
end
of
the
chain
is
secured
to
the
bits.
then
with
the
strain
off
the
wire
and
the
drum,
you
can
loosen
the
wire
on
the
drum
and
put
it
on
the
bits.
well,
they
did
that.
they
--
the
stopper
or
keeper
looked
new,
looked
to
be
in
good
condition.
they
put
it
on.
they
took
the
wire
off
the
drum
and
they
were
putting
it
on
the
bits
and
as
they
were
putting
it
the
second
turn,
the
chain
suddenly
broke
as
the
engines
of
the
ship
went
ahead.
that's
the
testimony.
why
they
went
ahead,
nobody
knows,
but
of
course
that
would
put
extra
strain
and
the
line
leading
aft
extra
strain
on
the
chain.
the
chain
broke
and
the
piece
of
a
chain
struck
rhoditis
in
the
leg.
rhoditis
was
then
taken
to
a
hospital
in
new
orleans
after
his
first
cast
was
removed.
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
travel,
he
was
moved
to
greece
and
he
was
able
to
return
to
work
according
to
the
trial
court
the
next
march.
hellenic
lines,
the
employer
is
a
greek
corporation.
it
had
in
its
employ
some
1100
seamen.
it
paid
taxes
last
year
of
over
$5
million
to
greece.
some
old
repair
bills
were
paid
to
greece
of
about
the
same
amount.
it,
however,
did
have
a
new
york
office
and
in
the
new
york
office,
the
record
shows
it
employed
between
75
to
100
people
depending
on
whether
it
appeared
to
the
testimony.
it
has
a
new
orleans
office,
10
to
15
people
and
the
pireas
office
of
70
to
75.
if
you
disregard
the
seaman,
then
you
do
have
more
people
employed
in
the
offices
in
new
york
than
in
greece
but
if
you
take
the
seaman
into
account
and
they
are
all
greeks
then
you
have
a
pronounced
greek
flavor
to
the
company.
there
are
also
some
longshoremen
employed
in
new
york
,
stevedores,
but
we
also
have
longshoremen
abroad
and
actually
you
employ
a
lot
more
longshoremen
abroad
than
you
do
in
this
country
because
you
have
better
machinery
in
this
country.
so
in
any
international
run,
you
tend
to
have
more
longshoremen
than
the
other
side.
we
believe
this
--
however
there
are
some
american
features
the
operation.
the
substantial
part
of
hellenic
heroes
trade
is
to
and
from
the
united
states.
while
hellenic
lines
is
a
greek
corporation,
the
majority
stockholder
and
the
principal
executive
officer
or
general
manager
of
the
company
is
a
resident
of
the
united
states
although
a
citizen
of
greece.
we
have
in
our
brief
for
the
petitioner
and
the
record
indicates
he
received
several
honors
from
the
kingdom
of
greece.
we
are
not
claiming
sovereign
immunity,
diplomatic
immunity
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
callimanopoulos
has
been
of
assistance,
the
greek
mission.
he
is
receiving
official
greek
passport
from
time
to
time
and
the
purpose
of
this
proof
in
the
record
is
to
show
his
allegiance
to
greece.
he
is
a
bona
fide
greek
citizen.
he
performs
duties
to
the
greek
government.
we
believe
this
case
comes
squarely
under
the
doctrine
of
larsen
against
lauritzen
because
both
these
cases
emphasized
two
things,
the
primacy
of
the
flag,
that
is
very
important.
the
flag
of
a
ship
should
determine
the
law
applicable
to
the
ship
and
also
the
fact
that
it's
important
that
there
will
be
an
available
forum.
there
is
an
available
forum
in
this
case.
mr.
rhoditis
can
pursue
his
claim
for
compensation
in
greece,
and
there
we
must
pay
him
under
greek
law
and
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
fact,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
specifies
particularly
the
adoption
of
greek
law
and
this
is
very
similar
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
followed
by
this
court
in
larsen
against
lauritzen
which
provided
for
determination
of
disputes
in
denmark.
the
--
in
larsen
against
lauritzen,
we
had
an
accident
in
havana
where
the
ship
sailing
between
united
states
and
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
both
--
that
ship
never
did
go
to
denmark
in
a
regular
trade.
both
vessels
had
crews
of
substantially
crews
of
the
citizenship
of
the
flag.
they
--
the
randa
did
have
a
few
chileans
but
all
the
officers
and
most
of
the
crew
were
danes.
in
both
cases,
the
--
we
claim
the
place
of
the
acts
in
this
is
unimportant.
in
the
randa
the
man
was
injured
in
havana
yet
he
was
brought
to
the
united
states
for
medical
treatment
and
he
remained.
larsen
actually
remained
in
the
united
states
until
he
was
able
to
sail
again,
so
the
medical
testimony
was
readily
available
here
yet
the
court
held
that
jones
act
did
apply.
in
both
cases,
the
court
was
based
for
the
seaman
who
was
engaged
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
negotiated
with
the
assistance
of
the
national
union
and
the
national
association
of
shipowners.
we
the
petitioner
here
and
the
greek
government
are
both
very
much
opposed
to
the
"runaway
flag".
insofar
as
the
respondent
and
his
amici
argue
against
the
runaway
flag
were
or
in
fully
in
a
court.
we
believe
that
argument
is
solved
but
we
say
it
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
our
position
is
that
as
stated
in
the
larsen
case
and
quoted
in
my
brief
amicus,
"each
state
under
international
law"
it's
page
3
"may
determine
for
itself
the
conditions
upon
which
you
can
grant
us
nationality
to
a
merchant
ship
thereby
accepting
responsibility
for
it
and
acquiring
authority
over
it.
we
believe
that
the
phrase
"accepting
responsibility"
is
important.
if
a
nation
does
not
accept
responsibility
for
its
merchant
ships
then
that
you
have
a
runaway
flag
situation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
can
--
it
still
subsists,
that
was
--
we
have
the
same
thing
in
tsakonites,
your
honor.
tsakonites
brought
his
case
up
in
the
second
circuit.
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
thereupon
tsakonites
commenced
proceedings
in
the
greek
court
and
recovered
and
that
is
exhibit
a
on
the
greek
government's
brief.
if
you
don't
accept
responsibility
for
a
ship
then
you
have
true
runaway
flag.
for
instance,
you
may
have
a
ship
under
say
panamanian
or
liberian
registry
with
a
cayman
island
crew,
norwegian
officers
and
spanish
engineers.
you
don't
have
the
regular
inspection
that
we
have.
the
greek
government
insists
on
regular
inspections
of
the
ship,
regular
surveys.
it
insists
on
greek
ownership.
if
you
have
a
foreign
corporation
owning
a
greek
ship
then
does
exists
here
then
the
technical
ownership
was
in
universal
cargo
carriers,
a
panamanian
corporation
but
the
ship
was
in
fact
operated
by
hellenic
who
hired
the
crew
then
you
must
under
greek
law
have
an
agent
in
greece
who
can
make
the
reports
necessary.
you
must
have
the
ship
under
the
greek
flag.
i
mean
you
do
have
a
--
you
must
also
have
a
greek
crew.
you
must
have
greek
officers.
you
have
a
pension
plan
in
greece
known
as
nat
capital
n,
capital
a,
capital
t
to
which
all
greek
seamen
must
contribute.
to
this
doctrine
of
recognizing
responsible
flags
has
been
followed
by
this
court
not
only
larsen
against
lauritzen
in
1953
but
again
in
1959,
in
romero
case
where
a
spanish
seaman
was
injured
on
a
spanish
ship
in
the
port
of
new
york,
the
court
held
that
spanish
laws
should
and
not
the
jones
act.
a
similar
case
in
mcculloch
against
honduran
union
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
not
apply
to
honduran
flag
ships
with
honduran
crews
operated
by
honduran
corporations
between
new
york
and
honduras
even
though
the
honduran
corporations
were
subsidiaries
of
an
american
corporation.
the
--
they
recognized
the
law
of
the
flag
as
being
a
responsible
flag
for
the
reason
that
these
honduran
ships
were
actually
meant
by
hondurans
and
they
had
honduran
officers.
the
background
being
of
course
that
these
ships
were
carrying
bananas
and
one
of
the
conditions
for
granting
banana
concessions,
the
fruit
company
would
be
that
bona
fide
honduran
ships
would
be
used
to
transport
bananas
and
while
the
ultimate
directions
of
these
ships
is
in
the
united
states,
the
allegiance
of
the
owner,
a
honduran
corporation
was
to
the
republic
of
honduras.
for
that
reason
when
the
court
declined
to
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
my
problem,
your
honor,
is
based
on
the
statute,
the
jones
act
and
possibly
on
the
general
maritime
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
the
jones
act,
your
honor,
provides
has
been
interpreted
as
applying
not
to
the
rights
of
foreign
crews
on
foreign
ships
but
to
the
rights
of
american
seamen
on
american
ships.
but
the
jones
act
and
this
court
was
held
not
apply
to
the
rights
of
a
danish
seaman
on
a
danish
ship
in
lauritzen
against
larsen
or
to
the
rights
of
a
spanish
seaman
on
a
spanish
ship
in
romero
against
international
terminal
operating
corporation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
sir.
there's
no
question
of
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there
are
jurisdiction
in
rem
and
in
personam,
yes
your
honor.
this
was
in
admiralty.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
the
jones
act
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
jones
act,
your
honor
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
19
--
it
does,
there's
in
the
statute.
now,
i
brief
this
point
thoroughly
in
my
randall,
larsen
--
lauritzen
against
larsen
case.
the
jones
act
is
section
20
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920.
certain
sections
of
that
act
specifically
apply
to
foreign
ships.
i'm
talking
primarily
about
the
provision
against
advances
that
applies
to
foreign
ships
as
well
as
to
american
ships
and
so
states
in
the
statute.
there's
another
section,
the
so-called
penalty
wage
statute
that
specifically
applies
to
foreign
vessels.
that
requires
a
shipowner
to
pay
half
earned
wages
in
an
intermediate
port
and
all
of
the
earned
wages
within
four
days
after
arriving
from
a
foreign
voyage
at
the
port
of
destination.
now,
the
history
is
rather
interesting.
when
those
two
sections
were
originally
enacted,
i
believe
it
was
the
shipping
act
of
1916
or
maybe
a
little
earlier.
they
were
in
general
terms
such
as
the
jones
act.
the
courts
construe
both
those
sections
in
the
first
instance
as
not
applying
either
to
advances
made
in
a
foreign
port
or
to
foreign
ships.
at
that
point,
both
sections
were
amended
specifically
to
apply
foreign
vessels.
consequently,
cases
like
strathearn
against
dillon
read
that
the
congress
had
the
power
to
apply
a
statute
to
foreign
vessels
but
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
to
apply
statutes
as
to
pay
and
as
permitting
advances
to
foreign
vessels
but
unless
it
specifically
applies
to
foreign
vessels
then
they
shouldn't
be
construed
so
as
to
apply
the
foreign
vessels
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
other
sections
of
the
shipping
act
refer
to
the
rights
of
any
shipowner
who
call
in
american
consul
in
a
foreign
port
must
submit
disputes
in
a
foreign
port.
well,
obviously,
you
wouldn't
expect
the
british
or
japanese
or
greek
ship
to
see
an
american
consul
in
london.
he'd
go
to
his
own
consul
if
he
had
trouble.
so
the
statute,
the
jones
act
has
been
construed
as
not
applying
to
foreign
crews
despite
the
broadness
of
the
terms
and
this
construction
of
the
jones
act
in
the
larsen
case
of
1953
was
followed
by
the
romero
case
is
1959
and
yet
congress
did
nothing
to
amend
the
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
decision
of
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
what?
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i'm
relying
--
i'm
relying
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
i'm
relying
basically
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
statute.
i'm
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
apply.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
i
was
--
i
was
afraid
you
might
ask
me
for
the
words
of
the
statute
i
was
relying
on
and
there
aren't
any.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there
aren't
any
words
mr.
justice
black
but
the
words
i
rely
on
are
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
no
question.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
it
should
be
governed
by
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
this
is
an
act
of
internal
management
of
a
greek
ship.
i
think
the
court
will
be
better
advised
to
decline
jurisdiction.
most
of
our
courts
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
situation
like
this
actually
declined
jurisdiction
on
the
condition
that
the
shipowner
appear
in
the
forum
of
its
native
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
we
have
that
in
o'neil
against
cunard
your
honor
where
i
believe
a
resident
of
the
united
states
was
injured
on
a
british
ship
and
the
court
declined
jurisdiction.
he
was
not
permitted
to
sue
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
my
recollection
is
that
they
said
the
jones
act
did
not
apply
and
since
the
man
was
insisting
in
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
on
that
point,
my
argument
is
based
in
the
committee
of
nations
and
the
application
of
the
greek
law.
i
say
that
neither
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
has
applied
the
internal
management
of
the
ships
nor
the
jones
act
is
applicable.
this
man's
rights
should
be
bound
under
the
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
in
that
case
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
courts
have
tried
the
cases.
that's
the
old
case
i
think
of
gambera
against
bergoty
and
i
believe
--
i
believe
that
is
a
correct
decision.
if
we
don't
have
a
convenient
forum
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
justice
clark
on
television
on
a
sunday,
one
of
the
big
injustices
is
delay
and
if
we
don't
have
a
convenient
forum
and
the
man
cannot
get
a
proper
decision
in
one
place,
he
should
get
it
in
another.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
think
so
but
i
think
it
should
also
apply
the
greek
law.
i
think
they've
applied
the
wrong
law.
they
applied
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
and
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
this
--
our
particular
case,
it
does
this
injury.
if
that
--
if
a
seaman
is
repaid
greater
to
greece
under
greek
law
he
gets
his
remedy
right
away
and
he
goes
ahead
and
if
he
goes
into
the
office
with
a
medical
certificate,
he
gets
his
money
and
the
existence
of
the
suit
in
this
country
is
not
a
defense.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
in
this
case,
he
very
likely
could
because
this
remedy
in
this
country
is
rather
small
when
you
consider
the
seriousness
of
the
injuries
and
when
you
consider
that
he
got
i
believe
$6,000.00
in
this
country
and
that's
all
he
gets,
he
can't
go
back.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he's
sailing
in
big
ships
out
of
greece.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
he
returned
to
greece
in
about
a
month
after
the
accident.
he
was
repatriated
to
greece
and
at
any
time
after
september,
i
believe,
he
could
have
started
this
action,
this
proceeding
in
greece
and
in
fact
he
got
some
money
in
greece
when
he
first
got
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
he
does
not.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
the
greek
law
is
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
because
first
of
all,
you
have
a
question
of
congestion
in
the
courts
and
the
second
place,
the
greek
remedy
is
similar
to
workman's
compensation.
it's
very
similar.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i'm
arguing
that
the
greeks
think
the
greek
remedy
is
better
and
the
greeks
have
provided
the
greek
remedy
for
greek
seamen
somewhat
a
workman's
compensation
with
punitive
damages
in
the
event
there's
a
violation
of
the
safety
law
or
a
safety
regulation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
doubt
it
very
much.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
but
i'm
saying
that
he
has
--
by
greek
rights
an
adequate
remedy
in
greece
as
provided
for
by
greek
law
and
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
accordance
with
larsen
against
lauritzen,
in
accordance
with
the
romero
case,
the
correct
law
to
be
applied
is
the
greek
law
and
under
the
greek
law,
he
will
get
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
i
believe
in
circumstances
where
you
have
a
seaman
on
--
injured
on
a
ship
which
is
a
bona
fide
foreign
flag
operator.
in
other
words,
the
country
of
the
flag
has
responsibility
for
the
ship
that
it
cruise
the
ship,
it
supervises
the
ship
and
where
there's
a
forum
readily
available,
then
i
believe
it
will
be
better
for
these
--
our
courts
that
decline
jurisdiction
and
in
any
event,
this
decision
below
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
but
i
say
this
decision
is
wrong
because
they
did
apply
united
states
law
not
greek
law.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
well,
there's
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
actually
there's
not
too
serious
a
danger.
that
there's
a
danger
some
double
liability
because
i
believe
he
collected
$140.00
in
greece
before
pireas
was
advised
of
the
existence
of
the
suit
in
this
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
then
they
--
then
they
stopped
paying,
yes.
because
he
had
--
this
is
a
technical
violation
of
the
articles.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes
they
did.
if
the
jones
act
expressly
applied
to
foreign
flag
vessels
sailing
in
american
waters,
then
a
number
of
sections
of
the
jones
act
specifically
invalidate
any
contractual
exemption
from
the
act.
there
is
a
section
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
is
incorporated
in
reference
by
the
jones
act
which
makes
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
act
by
contract
invalid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that
would
be
valid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
basis
but
this
principle
basis
of
my
argument
is
this
case
comes
squarely
under
larsen
--
lauritzen
against
larsen
and
romero.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right,
it
is.
and
lauritzen
against
larsen
so
states.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
he
can
get
--
he
can
get
more
money
quicker.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
but
sometimes
if
you
have
an
accident
like
this,
this
act
could
flare
up
later,
you
can
lose
in
the
long
run.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
think
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
none
of
the
courts
below
considered
at
all
the
number
of
greek
seamen
on
these
ships.
there
are
over
1100
seamen
to
back
up
our
point
that
this
is
a
bona
fide
greek
operation.
we
also
have
another
resting
opinion
from
judge
hoffman
in
virginia
which
is
the
next
to
the
supplemental
brief
which
he
goes
in
great
detail
to
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
on
the
application
of
the
contract
restrictions
to
determine
the
law
to
be
applied
and
finally,
we
have
the
fact
that
mr.
callimanopoulos,
he
may
be
a
binnacle,
but
he's
a
fair
paying
binnacle.
as
a
domiciliary,
he
is
required
to
pay
income
taxes
here
and
he
isn't
trying
to
avoid
any
of
his
american
obligations.
he
has
obligations
to
america,
and
to
greece
and
as
far
as
his
allegiance
to
greece
is
concerned,
he
is
a
citizen
of
greece
and
the
larsen
case
definitely
stated,
it
was
the
allegiance
of
the
shipowner
that
should
be
considered
as
one
of
the
primary
points.
his
allegiance
was
to
greece.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
one
--
one
of
the
points,
things
your
honor,
there
are
over
100,000
greek
seamen
and
one
of
the
largest
groups
of
seamen
in
the
world
and
i
think
the
principal
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
of
course
not.
it
is
higher
though
than
say
spanish
seamen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
it
is
lower
and
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
pays
on
--
he
pays
that
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
the
seamen
--
no,
the
seamen
contribute
and
he
contributes
to
a
seaman's
pension
fund,
nat,
n-a-t.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
that's
not
involved
here.
this
--
this
man
is
getting
his
nat
and
he
will
get
his
nat
when
he
retires.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he'll
get
more
than
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no.
he
was
just
disabled
for
i
think
seven
months.
he
got
40
pounds
a
month.
he'd
probably
get
$500.00
or
$600.00
as
wages,
he'd
get
medical
but
the
most
important
thing
he'd
get
in
greece
would
be
that
this
should
reactivate
itself.
he
would
then
get
further
medical
attention
and
a
further
payment
along
the
lines
of
workman's
compensation.
the
greek
law
is
actually
designed
to
be
similar
like
the
new
york
state
workman's
comp.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he
gets
paid
while
he's
disabled.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
he's
working
now.
he
won't
get
paid
if
a
thing
should
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
he'd
get
more
than
that.
he
got
paid
once.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
don't
know
how
much
more
and
if
there's
any
--
i
don't
--
this
court
found
no
disability
so
he'd
get
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
we're
defending
this
case
because
as
a
matter
of
principle
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
--
he'd
get
more.
i
can
assure
you
that
as
far
as
this,
if
it
were
not
for
the
principle
involved,
this
case
would
never
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
on
this
ship,
yes.
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
in
fact
the
mcculloch
case
says
it
is
the
same.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
all
of
the
stock
of
which
is
owned
by
a
greek
corporation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
a
greek
citizen
domiciled
in
this
country.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
that's
--
yes,
that
follows
the
argument
in
the
mcculloch.
now,
in
larsen
against
lauritzen,
the
allegiance
of
the
owner,
the
fact
the
owner
is
a
greek
citizen
is
important
and
the
same
way
in
the
romero
case
which
followed
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
say
there
are
many
flags
of
convenience
but
this
isn't
one
of
them.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
because
of
the
fact
the
greek
government
is
responsible
for
the
good
order
and
maintenance
of
the
ship.
they
have
a
greek
crew
on
board
this
ship.
they
have
greek
licensed
officers.
they
have
greek
inspections.
this
is
a
bona
fide
greek
operation.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
no.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
your
honor.
the
greek
law
set
forth
in
my
brief
requires
over
50%
of
the
stock
ownership
of
a
corporation
with
a
greek
flag
ship
being
greek.
that's
right
in
there.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
and
is
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
no,
i
will
say
that
99%
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
i
will
say
that
99%
was
owned
by
one
man
--
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
a
greek
citizen
with
allegiance
to
greece.
he's
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
he
does.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
but
he
is
a
greek
citizen.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
under
the
jones
act,
it
would
not
be
valid.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
there's
a
specific
provision
of
the
jones
act.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
yes.
mr.
james
m.
estabrook
thank
you,
your
honor.
