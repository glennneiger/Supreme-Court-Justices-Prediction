justice

white
could
he
have
his
recovery
here
and
also
have
recovery
under
the
greek
law?
is
there
any
danger
of
double
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
the
existence
of
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
stopped
paying?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
jones
act
expressly
applied
to
accidents
on
foreign
flag
ships
sailing
in
american
waters
but
the
parties
as
in
this
case
contracted
out,
attempted
to
contract
out,
the
parties
here
expressly
agreed
to
the
application
of
greek
law
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
contracting
out
of
the
application
of
the
general
maritime
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
another
basis
for
your
argument
i
take
it
that
the
parties
here
have
agreed
to
the
application
of
a
foreign
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
it's
fortified
by
the
parties
expressed
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
probably
better,
would
you
while
i'm
here.
i
would
think
that
would
be
decided
then
if
you
have
a
lawsuit
to
be
able
to
get
more
money
quicker.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
set
aside
the
special
agreements
would
apply
to
greek
because
of
the
provisions
of
your
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that's
mr.
justice
marshall's
question.
how
do
you
get
around
the
agreement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
absent
such
provision
of
contract,
maybe
you
could
--
maybe
you
could
inquire
the
general
principles
on
what
will
happen
out
there
once
that
discloses
the
agreement
sometimes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
did
you
sue
here
under
the
general
maritime
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
agreement
of
the
parties
--
that
is
the
greek
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
matter
to
the
lower
courts
whether
it
was
decided
to
the
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
sustain
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
only
answer
though
of
the
general
maritime
law
that
yes
you
would
by
the
agreement
parties,
in
those
conditions
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
general
rule
as
part
of
the
contract
with
respect
to
a
particular
body
of
law
who
may
know
that
they're
going
to
be
operating
within
the
area
of
several
nations
involved?
can
they
pick
one
up
and
one
who
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
whether
the
--
suppose
that
this
individual
was
a
greek
or
an
american,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
really
irrelevant
about
the
allegiance
of
the
majority
stockholder
of
this
corporation,
your
argument
would
be
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
--
and
the
owner
of
the
ship
anyway
is
a
panamanian
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
a
greek
corporation
and
99%
of
which
is
owned
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
things
are
really
irrelevant,
aren't
they,
to
your
argument
because
as
long
as
the
ship
is
registered
in
greece
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
carrying
the
foreign
flag
and
a
greek
crew
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it's
irrelevant
to
your
argument
who
the
owner
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
are
no
such
things
as
flags
of
convenience.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
one
of
them
because
--
justice
byron

and
that

that
anybody
from
anywhere
around
the
world
can
go
and
--
justice
byron

white
and
get
--
and
get
their
ships
that
