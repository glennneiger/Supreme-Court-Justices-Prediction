mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
according
to
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
case,
there
are
two
justifications
for
disregarding
the
law
of
the
nation
of
the
vessel's
foreign
flag
in
order
to
apply
american
law
in
a
suit
such
as
this.
the
first
justification
is
if
the
flag
is
merely
one
of
convenience
and
not
bona
fide.
the
other
is
if
there
exists
some
heavy
account
of
weight
to
even
a
bona
fide
foreign
flag,
we
contend
in
this
case
that
this
is
--
this
greek
flag
is
a
flag
merely
of
convenience
by
virtue
of
the
following
facts
which
i
shall
attempt
to
state
as
briefly
as
possible.
the
ship
owner
in
this
case
mr.
callimanopoulos,
a
greek
citizen
concededly
and
the
owner
of
the
petitioner
corporations
started
a
shipping
business
in
greece
in
1935.
this
greek
operation
operated
from
greece
was
reduced
to
absolutely
nothing
in
world
war
ii
by
sinking
an
enemy
action.
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
during
which
incidentally
the
greek
government
had
confiscated
his
ships
for
military
defense
purposes,
in
1945
he
came
to
the
united
states
and
started
over
a
completely
anew
in
the
shipping
business
such
that
there
was
no
continuum
of
greek
operation
and
greek
flag
used.
he
started
over
here
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
any
shipping
business
anywhere
else.
and
the
fact
is
that
now,
he
has
been
a
domiciliary
of
this
country
for
25
years.
during
the
last
19
of
which,
he
has
enjoyed
permanent
resident
alien
status.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
some
of
them
in
japan,
some
of
them
in
germany,
some
of
them
i
believe
in
this
country.
the
record
does
not
develop
that
quite
extensively
although
there
is
an
indication
that
the
first
five
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
the
very
first
five
ships
he
bought
were
american
liberty
ships
which
incidentally
he
bought
from
the
united
states
government.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that
is
correct.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
corporation
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
registered
owner
is
a
panamanian
corporation
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
not
the
registered
owner,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
it's
potentially
universal
cargo
carriers
corporation
which
is
a
panamanian
corporation.
all
the
stock
in
which
is
owned
petitioner
hellenic,
99%
of
the
stock
in
which
is
owned
by
mr.
pericles
callimanopoulos,
99
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
just
99%.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that's
all.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
absolutely
nothing
except
that
is
a
symbol
of
convenience
for
this
man
because
apparently
of
its
lax
shipping
laws.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
registered
the
ownership
of
19
of
22
of
his
united
states
line
of
service
vessels
to
a
panamanian
corporation.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
25
years
and
he's
been
a
domiciliary
for
that
long
and
for
the
last
19
he
has
had
permanent
resident
alien
status.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
his
son
who
also
lives
here,
a
mr.
gregory.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
also
in
new
york.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
don't
believe
his
son
is
either
although
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
neither
one
are
american
citizens,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
would
not
call
them
nationals.
i
would
call
them
nominal
citizens
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
regulations
for
foreign
travel,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
it
is
but
i
argue
that
the
domicile
in
the
united
states
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor.
continuing
on
factually,
he
finances
his
entire
operation
with
money
borrowed
from
new
york
banks
and
always
has.
the
claims
manager
of
petitioner,
hellenic,
is
the
united
states
citizen
in
domiciliary.
its
treasurer
who
collects
freight
rates
charged
all
over
the
world
is
a
united
states
citizen
domiciliary
and
one
of
its
directors
is
the
united
states
citizen
in
domiciliary.
his
ships
are
operated
from
the
united
states
in
five
regular
line
of
services.
that
is
the
operating
instructions
emanate
from
offices
in
new
york
city.
all
the
voyages
of
which
line
of
services
originate
and
terminate
the
united
states
with
all
cargos
thereon
originating
and
terminating
in
the
united
states
ports.
he
is
charging
freight
rates
fixed
by
united
states
line
of
conference
systems
of
which
his
corporations
are
members.
he
handles
virtually
no
trade
with
the
nation
from
which
he
came,
greece,
but
trades
actively
with
15
other
nations.
he
owns
his
docks
in
new
york.
he
employs
regularly
in
this
country
approximately
215
people
and
employs
only
at
most
a
total
75
in
greece
but
more
significant
and
i'm
getting
at
what
i
think
establishes
the
broad
of
the
connection
with
the
united
states.
it
is
the
policy
of
his
company
that
all
cargos
including
european
cargos
are
solicited
only
by
his
new
york
office
even
in
situations
were
the
greek
office
learns
of
their
movement
first
in
greece,
they
are
required
by
the
rules
of
the
company
to
relay
this
information
to
petitioners
u.s.
office
so
that
the
latter,
not
the
greek
office,
may
solicit
such
cargo
and
most
significant,
getting
to
this
panamanian
corporation.
in
1956,
mr.
callimanopoulos
registered
the
ownership
of
most
of
his
u.s.
line
of
service
vessels
to
two
panamanian
corporations
created
by
him
especially
for
this
purpose,
trans
pacific
cargo
carriers,
inc.
and
petitioner,
universal.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
your
honor,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
that
inquiry
emphasizes
the
importance
of
the
place
of
the
wrongful
act
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
because
of
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
his
contacts
with
the
united
states.
if
the
seamen
were
able
to
perfect
his
suit
by
process
in
the
united
states
even
for
an
injury
in
a
foreign
port,
the
jones
act
would
be
applicable.
i
think
that
the
seven
factors
emphasized
by
lauritzen
when
weighed
here
under
these
circumstances
even
changing
the
place
of
the
wrongful
act
would
indicate
that
the
jones
act
would
apply.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
to
my
way
of
thinking,
the
only
contacts
are
really
convenient
economic
one.
he
buys
the
flags
that
he
flies
on
his
ships.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
flags
that
he
flies
on
his
vessels
in
greece
and
he
hires
his
crews
in
greece.
now,
he
is
obliged
by
greek
law
to
deduct
from
the
wages
he
pays
his
seamen
certain
money
for
taxes
which
he
pays
in
greece
and
before
the
suez
canal
closed,
some
of
the
vessels
he
operated
exclusively
between
europe
and
turkey
were
repaired
in
greece
but
none
of
these
u.s.
line
of
service
vessels
to
which
the
jones
act
was
applied
in
this
case.
those
are
his
only
contacts.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
nothing
but
a
paper
corporation.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
it
was
really
organized
in
new
york
city
and
some
papers
were
mailed
to
panama
according
to
a
routine
that
they
have
for
establishment.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no
he
doesn't
do
any
significant
--
he
does
practically
no
shipping
of
cargo
to
greece.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
ships
cargos
between
the
united
states
and
15
other
nations
besides
greece,
india,
pakistan
and
burma.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
testified
himself
and
so
did
his
claims
management
only
occasionally
do
they
handle
cargo
to
and
from
greece.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
feel
that
that's
all
he
has
with
greece,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
only
contact
with
american
workman
that
could
have
been
had
and
this
was
developed
by
counsel
for
petitioners
when
the
deposition
of
the
respondent
was
taken
was
that
the
ship
was
in
tow
by
an
american
tug
but
there
was
never
any
attempt
either
on
the
part
of
my
side
of
the
case
or
that
of
my
opponents
to
show
that
he
tug
was
responsible
for
the
parting
of
the
line.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
absolutely
none
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
need
justify
its
affirmation
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
on
those
kinds
of
considerations.
the
considerations
that
i
have
urged
for
an
affirmance
are
technical
legal
ones
based
on
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
amici
curiae
who
have
taken
my
side
of
this
case
have
argued
that
it
would
help
to
equalize
competition
between
american
and
foreign
shipping
if
the
jones
act
were
applied
to
foreign
operators
that
come
in
to
our
ports.
but
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
lauritzen
case
indicated
that
the
argument
of
that
type
was
misaddressed
to
this
court
and
it
should
have
been
taken
over
that
at
congress
and
if
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
it
was
not
for
this
court
to
legislate
it
but
for
congress
to
do
so
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessary
to
justify
an
affirmation
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
certainly.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
don't
think
you
do
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
fatal
to
my
cause
here.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
first,
let
me
say
that
the
larsen
--
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
case
specifically
ruled
out
the
law
provided
for
by
the
contract
and
they
in
fact
that
that
could
determine
or
even
effect
the
application
of
the
jones
act.
many
readers
of
the
decision
have
been
mislead
into
thinking
so
but
what
the
case
actually
says
is
that
the
place
of
the
contract
while
it
has
some
weak
significance,
the
law
of
the
contract
has
none
and
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
we
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
our
argument
is
that
what
law
applies
is
the
question,
the
answer
to
which
must
be
arrived
at
through
the
course
of
testing
the
seven
factors
enunciated
in
lauritzen.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no,
i
will
explain
that
fully.
well,
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
the
jones
act
of
course
itself
says
that
any
contract
rule
regulation
or
device
whatsoever
the
purpose
intended
which
shall
be
to
abrogate
the
common
carriers'
liability
with
this
chapter
to
that
extent
shall
be
void
and
this
court
in
lauritzen
recognized
and
the
specific
language
was
but
we
think
another
result
would
follow
if
the
contract
attempted
to
avoid
applicable
law.
now,
the
significance
of
that
can
only
be
that
something
besides
the
contract
was
determined
in
the
first
place,
what
law
is
applicable.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
lauritzen
does.
it
says,
you
must
find
the
answer
through
the
seven
factors
that
this
court
listed
and
once
that
determination
is
reached,
the
contract
cannot
shake
it.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
we
did,
your
honor,
and
that's
--
well,
that
is
an
alternative
argument
of
mine
that
even
if
your
honors
don't
apply
the
jones
act,
the
district
court
was
well
within
its
discretion
to
take
jurisdiction
and
apply
our
law.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes.
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
me
that
because
i
do
have
a
succinct
answer
to
it.
it
has
been
held
in
general
maritime
law
cases
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
notably
the
blanco
versus
phoenix
compania
de
navegacion,
s.a.
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
that
two
things
must
concur
when
a
seaman
signs
a
restrictive
provision
in
employment
contract.
the
first
is
that
regardless
of
his
literacy
well-known,
the
restrictive
provision
be
explained
to
him
and
the
second
is
that
he
be
paid
extra
compensation
for
his
agreement
so
restrict
his
rights.
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicated
that
neither
was
the
provision
explained
to
him.
he
was
completely
unaware
of
its
existence.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
they
are
in
evidence
and
they
sustained
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
don't
know
if
your
honor
would
see
fit
to
it.
but
they
are
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
would
say
that
not
as
the
between
respondent
and
petitioner
universal.
petitioner
universal
is
a
panamanian
corporation
and
a
contract
between
a
greek
citizen
and
a
panamanian
corporation
for
the
application
of
greek
law,
i
don't
think
would
be
entitled
to
any
greater
weight
because
there's
no
exclusive
ruling
out
of
the
contract
in
the
jones
act.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
this
court
said
in
the
lauritzen
case
that
in
contract
matters,
in
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
for
specific
performance,
then
they
would
be
bound
by
the
law
chosen
in
the
contract
but
the
court
pointed
to
the
obvious
that
a
jones
act
suit
is
for
tort
and
such
a
contract
cannot
control
what
law
applies
in
a
tort
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
that
was
in
effect
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
the
district
court
but
i'm
not
certain
in
what
sense
--
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
flag
of
convenience.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
specifically,
i
don't
recall
that
language
in
the
district
court
but
i
do
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
that
was
their
exact
language
but
let
me
say
this.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
merely
because
of
the
flag
which
it
flies,
it
has
a
greek
flag.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
if
the
owner
saw
fit
to
purchase
a
flag
in
panama,
i'm
sure
he
could.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
not
only
say
that
but
i
would
say
that
if
these
were
american
citizens
that
that
has
no
significance
at
all.
when
you're
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
national
allegiance
of
a
corporation,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
the
law
to
which
its
subject,
the
u.s.
citizenship
of
its
stockholders
could
not
render
american
law
applicable
to
it.
if
this
was
so,
american
citizens
would
have
the
power
to
taint
and
stigmatized
bona
fide
foreign
enterprises
by
buying
their
stock
and
thereby
subjecting
them
to
more
stringent
american
laws.
and
when
it
comes
to
a
corporation,
it's
my
understanding
of
a
basic
corporation
law
that
presence
of
principal
actors
and
parties
in
a
forum
state
of
the
corporation
and
conduct
in
the
forum
of
the
corporation's
principal
business
including
all
managerial
and
operational
functions
far
outweighs
the
naked
fact
that
the
incorporation
elsewhere
as
far
as
determining
that
the
law
of
the
forum
is
applicable
to
such
a
corporation
and
this
has
been
the
decision
of
many
of
our
district
in
the
circuit
courts
in
cases
specifically
involving
the
application
of
the
jones
act
of
foreign
registered
corporations.
what
they
have
looked
to
is
not
the
citizenship
of
the
stockholders
but
to
the
place
where
the
corporation
makes
its
money.
any
other
result
would
result
in
chaos.
if
corporations
were
held
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
place
where
they
paid
dividends
to
their
stockholders
or
to
the
law
of
the
place
where
they
borrowed
the
money
to
finance
their
operations,
this
would
indeed
result
in
chaos
and
do
more
to
blight
international
commerce
in
the
application
of
the
jones
act
to
this
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
that
is
of
course
a
legitimate
invalid
way
of
looking
at
it
but
the
money
is
paid
in
new
york
city,
that's
where
the
checks
or
the
credits
are
forwarded.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i
would
clarify
it
in
order
to
maintain
and
say
that
it
is
the
base
of
operation
or
the
commercial
domicile.
the
place
where
the
corporation
carries
on
its
principal
business
and
when
i
said
the
place
where
it
makes
money,
i
meant
the
place
where
it
does
what
it
has
to
do
to
make
the
money.
he's
running
ships
from
new
york.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
started
off
buying
five
but
then
apparently
he
is
a
very
intelligent
operator
and
he
made
enough
money
to
build
up
to
a
fleet
of
what
now
totals
approximately
40
ships
which
has
been
built
all
over
the
world.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
it
would
depend
on
the
place
from
which
he
run
it
to
my
way
of
thinking.
it
would
depend
--
if
we
are
to
look
at
the
corporations
and
ask
--
in
other
words,
if
we
only
look
at
this
corporate
façade
and
ask
what
is
the
allegiance
of
this
corporations,
i
would
say
it
is
the
place
where
the
corporations
do
their
business
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
to
look
at
the
individual,
i
think
we
should
do
what
this
court
did
in
the
lauritzen
case
and
that
is
look
to
the
national
allegiance
of
this
individual
shipowner
and
i've
cited
a
body
of
law
of
what
i
think
is
impressive
universality
and
maturity
going
back
150
years
according
to
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
of
nations,
a
man's
national
allegiance
is
deemed
to
be
to
that
nation
where
he
has
his
domicile
because
domicile
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
national
character
susceptible
of
course
at
all
times
to
explanations.
if
it
be
for
a
special
purpose
and
transient
in
its
nature
then
it
does
not
derogate
from
or
destroy
the
prior
or
original
national
character
but
if
it
be
taken
up
with
the
intention
of
remaining
as
here,
then
it
substitutes
for
the
original
or
prior
national
character,
the
disabilities
and
penalties
as
well
as
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
united
states
citizen.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
held
that
in
the
case
of
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding
in
which
the
justice
department
attempted
to
deport
without
a
hearing
a
resident
alien
and
he
claimed
that
the
constitutional
privileges
were
available
to
him.
i
see
if
i
may
so
that
the
honorable
mr.
davis
here
represented
the
government
in
that
case
and
your
honor
held
that
even
though
congress
had
never
said
it,
and
the
constitutional
convention
didn't
put
it
in
the
constitution,
your
honor
held
that
the
constitutional
protections
were
available
to
resident
aliens
and
these
cases
which
i've
cited,
have
held
further
resident
aliens
are
subject
to
our
draft
laws.
they
must
pair
all
their
lives
for
the
honor
of
this
country's
defense
even
though
they
are
not
citizens.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
there
is
none
in
the
legislative
history.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no
there
were
not.
let
me
say
this.
though
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
based
on
language
of
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
lauritzen
case,
he
pointed
that
the
laws
of
this
--
the
shipping
laws
of
this
country
which
are
contained
in
title
46
are
many
and
of
those
very
few
are
specific
in
their
language,
in
their
application
either
to
american
or
foreign
shipping
operations
and
this
is
what
he
said
about
that.
he
said
many
give
no
evidence
that
congress
addressed
itself
to
their
foreign
application
and
are
in
general
terms
which
leave
their
application
to
be
judicially
determined
from
context
and
circumstance.
he
decided
that
where
congress
has
been
silent,
while
it
is
not
--
the
courts
not
only
made
but
they
must
speak
on
what
they
mean
and
then
specifically
with
reference
to
the
jones
act,
he
said
congress
could
not
have
been
unaware
of
the
necessity
of
construction
imposed
upon
courts
by
such
generality
of
language
and
was
well
warned
but
in
the
absence
of
the
more
definite
directions
than
are
contained
in
the
jones
act,
it
would
be
applied
by
the
courts
two
foreign
advanced
ships
and
foreign
seamen
in
accordance
with
the
usual
doctrine
and
practices
of
maritime
law.
so
apparently
congress
has
felt
that
the
courts
must
and
are
able
to
determine
in
each
case
whether
they
are
sufficient
contacts
of
the
united
states
as
weighed
by
the
seven
factors
to
lauritzen
test
to
warrant
or
justify
the
application
to
foreign
transactions
or
not.
so
that
in
effect,
it
has
not
been
necessary
for
congress
to
legislate
on
that.
i
think
it
would
even
be
dangerous
for
congress
to
legislate
on
that
because
these
shipping
operators
--
the
national
symbols
for
which
they
surround
themselves
are
but
part
and
parcel
of
the
paraphernalia
that's
dictated
by
the
exigencies
and
convenience
of
their
economics
and
commerce
and
the
scrambled
types
of
transactions
at
which
we
have
a
wonderful
example
here
are
just
typical.
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
congress
to
comprehend
in
one
act
something
that
would
slice
the
line
between
a
bona
fide
foreign
operator
like
mr.
jay
lauritzen
of
denmark
who
has
always
incidentally
been
a
danish
domiciliary
and
an
operator
like
mr.
pericles
callimanopoulos
who
is
enjoying
the
privileges
and
the
immunities
as
american
citizen
by
living
here.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
do
not
your
honor
and
they
are
certainly
would
not
make
a
matter
of
proof
in
this
case.
let
me
if
i
may
dwell
upon
the
tsakonites
decision
as
your
honors
i
believe
have
been
made
aware,
this
case
comes
to
you
on
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
that
tsakonites
court
decided
on
identical
facts
that
the
jones
act
did
not
apply.
incidentally,
with
regard
to
what
i
contend
as
a
flag
of
convenience
here,
i
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
if
mr.
callimanopoulos
had
just
recently
come
over
here,
--
if
he
had
just
recently
come
here
and
then
only
temporarily
to
get
started,
a
united
states
office
is
merely
a
small
branch
to
a
greek
office
and
they
were
a
continued
and
uninterrupted
use
of
greek
flags
as
part
of
a
principal
business
in
greece
which
is
not
the
case
and
even
your
honor
would
say
that
the
court
of
the
united
states
would
be
stretching
matters
rather
far
to
brand
his
flags
as
flags
of
convenience
but
whereas
here,
there's
an
overwhelming
preponderance
of
contacts
with
the
united
states
as
i've
outlined
and
corporate
registry
in
panama,
it
is
obvious
that
what
this
man
is
doing
is
dictated
by
convenience.
and
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
even
under
these
circumstances,
such
a
flag
is
a
bona
fide
flag,
then
i
would
conclude
that
the
united
states
has
become
a
fair
game
to
a
certain
extent
for
economic
parasites
to
entrust
themselves
like
binnacles
in
the
whole
of
our
maritime
commerce.
but
getting
to
tsakonites,
in
tsakonites,
the
basis
of
the
decision
was,
i
beg
your
pardon,
let
me
say
that
no
case
has
really
set
forth
guidelines
as
to
what
determines
whether
a
flag
is
one
of
convenience
or
not.
our
courts
have
had
no
difficulty
for
instance
in
saying
that
where
american
citizens
domiciled
here
and
operating
ships
from
here,
have
gone
shopping
abroad
in
a
foreign
marketplace
of
flags
and
gotten
a
foreign
flag,
and
such
a
flag
is
obviously
not
a
good
faith
flag
and
on
the
other
hand,
where
it
is
foreign
citizens
with
a
bona
fide
foreign
operation
and
the
foreign
flag
of
the
same
nation,
then
that
is
obviously
a
bona
fide
flag.
but
these
facts
are
in
between
and
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
be
doing
a
service
at
least
to
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
to
tell
us
what
is
the
flag
of
convenience
so
that
never
again
shall
two
circuit
courts
of
appeal
look
at
identical
facts
and
come
up
with
opposite
conclusions
as
the
fifth
and
the
second
have
done
here.
now,
this
was
the
reason
for
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
tsakonites.
it
was
the
law
of
the
contract.
they
conceded
their
own
confusion
as
a
result
of
the
facts.
they
said,
"we
must
concede
that
these
--
this
constellation
of
facts"
and
i'm
only
paraphrasing,
"presents
a
combination
never
before
seen
in
any
other
case
and
they
took
the
easy
but
the
wrong
way
out
and
decided
the
case
on
the
law
of
the
contract
which
as
i
believe
has
been
well
dealt
with
cannot
wag
the
dog,
that's
only
the
tail
and
the
act
of
the
law
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
seven
lauritzen
factors.
i
believe
i
have
also
indicated
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
your
honors
to
decide
that
this
flag
is
one
of
convenience
in
order
to
uphold
the
fifth
circuit
even
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
flag
in
accordance
with
lauritzen,
there
exists
to
it
that
heavy
counterweight
of
the
domicile
and
national
allegiance
of
the
shipowner.
may
i
have
an
alternative
argument
that
the
general
maritime
law
would
be
applicable
here
as
not
being
repugnant
to
the
law
of
greece
under
two
theories.
two
cases
which
i
have
not
cited
in
my
brief,
one
from
this
court,
the
scotland
and
the
other
heredia
versus
davies
held
that
in
matters
of
this
type
where
foreign
law
is
not
proved,
it
may
be
presumed
to
be
the
same
as
the
law
of
the
united
states.
that
being
the
case,
then
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
the
law
of
greece
in
applying
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
$6,000.00
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
this
is
about
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
approximately
one-thirtieth
of
that.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
one
thirtieth.
there
was
a
testimony
in
the
district
court.
i
beg
your
pardon,
he
would
have
been
able
to
get
4800
drachmas,
i
think
it
was
and
that's
divided
by
30,
it's
a
$160.00
which
they
did
pay
him
and
incidentally
that
payment
was
made
to
my
client
after
the
petitioners
were
on
notice
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
this
was
an
attempt
to
label
money
as
part
of
a
foreign
remedy
in
order
to
try
to
determine
applicable
law.
it
was
a
payment
made
to
a
known
represented
claimant.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
he
was.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
received
most
of
that
in
greece
although
he
was
hospitalized
for
approximately
two
weeks
in
the
united
states
but
that
is
a
factor
which
if
i
may
say
has
never
been
given
any
weight
by
any
court.
well,
i
understand.
i
just
asked.
what
were
--
what
were
the
nature
and
extent
of
his
injuries?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
when
i
say
puncture
fractures,
it
was
made
by
broken
chain
lengths,
so
there
were
two
prongs
and
they're
just
punctured
about
half
an
inch
deep
and
just
made
some
chunky
fractures.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well
a
law
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
a
long
time
ago,
this
court,
i
believe
in
the
osceola
decided
that
the
maritime
law
of
nations
at
least
as
far
as
it
applies
to
seamen
is
that
they
have
a
right
of
action
for
damages
for
unseaworthiness
but
since
that
time,
the
general
maritime
law
has
come
to
be
viewed
as
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
whatever
the
international
maritime
law
and
the
law
of
nations
is.
but
i
think
that
that
quotation
taken
in
connection
with
his
dispensing
or
giving
short
shrift
to
the
argument
that
the
interest
of
the
seamen
in
that
case
were
the
interest
of
the
united
states
because
if
he
were
granted
recovery,
it
would
equalize
competition,
this
was
i
believe
mr.
justice
jackson's
way
of
saying
that
we
cannot
consider
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
kind
of
a
contact
--
context
in
order
to
oust
some
applicable
law
of
another
foreign
nation,
of
a
foreign
nation.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
according
to
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
case,
there
are
two
justifications
for
disregarding
the
law
of
the
nation
of
the
vessel's
foreign
flag
in
order
to
apply
american
law
in
a
suit
such
as
this.
the
first
justification
is
if
the
flag
is
merely
one
of
convenience
and
not
bona
fide.
the
other
is
if
there
exists
some
heavy
account
of
weight
to
even
a
bona
fide
foreign
flag,
we
contend
in
this
case
that
this
is
--
this
greek
flag
is
a
flag
merely
of
convenience
by
virtue
of
the
following
facts
which
i
shall
attempt
to
state
as
briefly
as
possible.
the
ship
owner
in
this
case
mr.
callimanopoulos,
a
greek
citizen
concededly
and
the
owner
of
the
petitioner
corporations
started
a
shipping
business
in
greece
in
1935.
this
greek
operation
operated
from
greece
was
reduced
to
absolutely
nothing
in
world
war
ii
by
sinking
an
enemy
action.
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
during
which
incidentally
the
greek
government
had
confiscated
his
ships
for
military
defense
purposes,
in
1945
he
came
to
the
united
states
and
started
over
a
completely
anew
in
the
shipping
business
such
that
there
was
no
continuum
of
greek
operation
and
greek
flag
used.
he
started
over
here
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
any
shipping
business
anywhere
else.
and
the
fact
is
that
now,
he
has
been
a
domiciliary
of
this
country
for
25
years.
during
the
last
19
of
which,
he
has
enjoyed
permanent
resident
alien
status.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
some
of
them
in
japan,
some
of
them
in
germany,
some
of
them
i
believe
in
this
country.
the
record
does
not
develop
that
quite
extensively
although
there
is
an
indication
that
the
first
five
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
the
very
first
five
ships
he
bought
were
american
liberty
ships
which
incidentally
he
bought
from
the
united
states
government.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that
is
correct.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
corporation
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
registered
owner
is
a
panamanian
corporation
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
not
the
registered
owner,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
it's
potentially
universal
cargo
carriers
corporation
which
is
a
panamanian
corporation.
all
the
stock
in
which
is
owned
petitioner
hellenic,
99%
of
the
stock
in
which
is
owned
by
mr.
pericles
callimanopoulos,
99
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
just
99%.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that's
all.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
absolutely
nothing
except
that
is
a
symbol
of
convenience
for
this
man
because
apparently
of
its
lax
shipping
laws.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
registered
the
ownership
of
19

25
years
and
he's
been
a
domiciliary
for
that
long
and
for
the
last
19
he
has
had
permanent
resident
alien
status.
mr.

a

mr.

also
in

mr.
joseph

stahl
i
don't
believe
his
son
is
either
although
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
neither
one
are
american
citizens,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
would
not
call
them
nationals.
i
would
call
them
nominal
citizens
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
regulations
for
foreign
travel,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
it
is
but
i
argue
that
the
domicile
in
the
united
states
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor.
continuing
on
factually,
he
finances
his
entire
operation
with
money
borrowed
from
new
york
banks
and
always
has.
the
claims
manager
of
petitioner,
hellenic,
is
the
united
states
citizen
in
domiciliary.
its
treasurer
who
collects
freight
rates
charged
all
over
the
world
is
a
united
states
citizen
domiciliary
and
one
of
its
directors
is
the
united
states
citizen
in
domiciliary.
his
ships
are
operated
from
the
united
states
in
five
regular
line
of
services.
that
is
the
operating
instructions
emanate
from
offices
in
new
york
city.
all
the
voyages
of
which
line
of
services
originate
and
terminate
the
united
states
with
all
cargos
thereon
originating
and
terminating
in
the
united
states
ports.
he
is
charging
freight
rates
fixed
by
united
states
line
of
conference
systems
of
which
his
corporations
are
members.
he
handles
virtually
no
trade
with
the
nation
from
which
he
came,
greece,
but
trades
actively
with
15
other
nations.
he
owns
his
docks
in
new
york.
he
employs
regularly
in
this
country
approximately
215
people
and
employs
only
at
most
a
total
75
in
greece
but
more
significant
and
i'm
getting
at
what
i
think
establishes
the
broad
of
the
connection
with
the
united
states.
it
is
the
policy
of
his
company
that
all
cargos
including
european
cargos
are
solicited
only
by
his
new
york
office
even
in
situations
were
the
greek
office
learns
of
their
movement
first
in
greece,
they
are
required
by
the
rules
of
the
company
to
relay
this
information
to
petitioners
u.s.
office
so
that
the
latter,
not
the
greek
office,
may
solicit
such
cargo
and
most
significant,
getting
to
this
panamanian
corporation.
in
1956,
mr.
callimanopoulos
registered
the
ownership
of
most
of
his
u.s.
line
of
service
vessels
to
two
panamanian
corporations
created
by
him
especially
for
this
purpose,
trans
pacific
cargo
carriers,
inc.
and
petitioner,
universal.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
your
honor,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
that
inquiry
emphasizes
the
importance
of
the
place
of
the
wrongful
act
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
because
of
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
his
contacts
with
the
united
states.
if
the
seamen
were
able
to
perfect
his
suit
by
process
in
the
united
states
even
for
an
injury
in
a
foreign
port,
the
jones
act
would
be
applicable.
i
think
that
the
seven
factors
emphasized
by
lauritzen
when
weighed
here
under
these
circumstances
even
changing
the
place
of
the
wrongful
act
would
indicate
that
the
jones
act
would
apply.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
to
my
way
of
thinking,
the
only
contacts
are
really
convenient
economic
one.
he
buys
the
flags
that
he
flies
on
his
ships.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
flags
that
he
flies
on
his
vessels
in
greece
and
he
hires
his
crews
in
greece.
now,
he
is
obliged
by
greek
law
to
deduct
from
the
wages
he
pays
his
seamen
certain
money
for
taxes
which
he
pays
in
greece
and
before
the
suez
canal
closed,
some
of
the
vessels
he
operated
exclusively
between
europe
and
turkey
were
repaired
in
greece
but
none
of
these
u.s.
line
of
service
vessels
to
which
the
jones
act
was
applied
in
this
case.
those
are
his
only
contacts.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
nothing
but
a
paper
corporation.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
it
was
really
organized
in
new
york
city
and
some
papers
were
mailed
to
panama
according
to
a
routine
that
they
have
for
establishment.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no
he
doesn't
do
any
significant
--
he
does
practically
no
shipping
of
cargo
to
greece.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
ships
cargos
between
the
united
states
and
15
other
nations
besides
greece,
india,
pakistan
and
burma.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
testified
himself
and
so
did
his
claims
management
only
occasionally
do
they
handle
cargo
to
and
from
greece.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
feel
that
that's
all
he
has
with
greece,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
the
only
contact
with
american
workman
that
could
have
been
had
and
this
was
developed
by
counsel
for
petitioners
when
the
deposition
of
the
respondent
was
taken
was
that
the
ship
was
in
tow
by
an
american
tug
but
there
was
never
any
attempt
either
on
the
part
of
my
side
of
the
case
or
that
of
my
opponents
to
show
that
he
tug
was
responsible
for
the
parting
of
the
line.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
absolutely
none
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
need
justify
its
affirmation
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
on
those
kinds
of
considerations.
the
considerations
that
i
have
urged
for
an
affirmance
are
technical
legal
ones
based
on
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
amici
curiae
who
have
taken
my
side
of
this
case
have
argued
that
it
would
help
to
equalize
competition
between
american
and
foreign
shipping
if
the
jones
act
were
applied
to
foreign
operators
that
come
in
to
our
ports.
but
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
lauritzen
case
indicated
that
the
argument
of
that
type
was
misaddressed
to
this
court
and
it
should
have
been
taken
over
that
at
congress
and
if
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
it
was
not
for
this
court
to
legislate
it
but
for
congress
to
do
so
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessary
to
justify
an
affirmation
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
certainly.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
don't
think
you
do
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
fatal
to
my
cause
here.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
first,
let
me
say
that
the
larsen
--
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
case
specifically
ruled
out
the
law
provided
for
by
the
contract
and
they
in
fact
that
that
could
determine
or
even
effect
the
application
of
the
jones
act.
many
readers
of
the
decision
have
been
mislead
into
thinking
so
but
what
the
case
actually
says
is
that
the
place
of
the
contract
while
it
has
some
weak
significance,
the
law
of
the
contract
has
none
and
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
we
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
our
argument
is
that
what
law
applies
is
the
question,
the
answer
to
which
must
be
arrived
at
through
the
course
of
testing
the
seven
factors
enunciated
in
lauritzen.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no,
i
will
explain
that
fully.
well,
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
the
jones
act
of
course
itself
says
that
any
contract
rule
regulation
or
device
whatsoever
the
purpose
intended
which
shall
be
to
abrogate
the
common
carriers'
liability
with
this
chapter
to
that
extent
shall
be
void
and
this
court
in
lauritzen
recognized
and
the
specific
language
was
but
we
think
another
result
would
follow
if
the
contract
attempted
to
avoid
applicable
law.
now,
the
significance
of
that
can
only
be
that
something
besides
the
contract
was
determined
in
the
first
place,
what
law
is
applicable.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
lauritzen
does.
it
says,
you
must
find
the
answer
through
the
seven
factors
that
this
court
listed
and
once
that
determination
is
reached,
the
contract
cannot
shake
it.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
we
did,
your
honor,
and
that's
--
well,
that
is
an
alternative
argument
of
mine
that
even
if
your
honors
don't
apply
the
jones
act,
the
district
court
was
well
within
its
discretion
to
take
jurisdiction
and
apply
our
law.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes.
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
me
that
because
i
do
have
a
succinct
answer
to
it.
it
has
been
held
in
general
maritime
law
cases
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
notably
the
blanco
versus
phoenix
compania
de
navegacion,
s.a.
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
that
two
things
must
concur
when
a
seaman
signs
a
restrictive
provision
in
employment
contract.
the
first
is
that
regardless
of
his
literacy
well-known,
the
restrictive
provision
be
explained
to
him
and
the
second
is
that
he
be
paid
extra
compensation
for
his
agreement
so
restrict
his
rights.
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicated
that
neither
was
the
provision
explained
to
him.
he
was
completely
unaware
of
its
existence.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
they
are
in
evidence
and
they
sustained
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
don't
know
if
your
honor
would
see
fit
to
it.
but
they
are
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
would
say
that
not
as
the
between
respondent
and
petitioner
universal.
petitioner
universal
is
a
panamanian
corporation
and
a
contract
between
a
greek
citizen
and
a
panamanian
corporation
for
the
application
of
greek
law,
i
don't
think
would
be
entitled
to
any
greater
weight
because
there's
no
exclusive
ruling
out
of
the
contract
in
the
jones
act.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
this
court
said
in
the
lauritzen
case
that
in
contract
matters,
in
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
for
specific
performance,
then
they
would
be
bound
by
the
law
chosen
in
the
contract
but
the
court
pointed
to
the
obvious
that
a
jones
act
suit
is
for
tort
and
such
a
contract
cannot
control
what
law
applies
in
a
tort
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
that
was
in
effect
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
the
district
court
but
i'm
not
certain
in
what
sense
--
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
flag
of
convenience.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
specifically,
i
don't
recall
that
language
in
the
district
court
but
i
do
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
that
was
their
exact
language
but
let
me
say
this.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
merely
because
of
the
flag
which
it
flies,
it
has
a
greek
flag.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
if
the
owner
saw
fit
to
purchase
a
flag
in
panama,
i'm
sure
he
could.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
not
only
say
that
but
i
would
say
that
if
these
were
american
citizens
that
that
has
no
significance
at
all.
when
you're
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
national
allegiance
of
a
corporation,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
the
law
to
which
its
subject,
the
u.s.
citizenship
of
its
stockholders
could
not
render
american
law
applicable
to
it.
if
this
was
so,
american
citizens
would
have
the
power
to
taint
and
stigmatized
bona
fide
foreign
enterprises
by
buying
their
stock
and
thereby
subjecting
them
to
more
stringent
american
laws.
and
when
it
comes
to
a
corporation,
it's
my
understanding
of
a
basic
corporation
law
that
presence
of
principal
actors
and
parties
in
a
forum
state
of
the
corporation
and
conduct
in
the
forum
of
the
corporation's
principal
business
including
all
managerial
and
operational
functions
far
outweighs
the
naked
fact
that
the
incorporation
elsewhere
as
far
as
determining
that
the
law
of
the
forum
is
applicable
to
such
a
corporation
and
this
has
been
the
decision
of
many
of
our
district
in
the
circuit
courts
in
cases
specifically
involving
the
application
of
the
jones
act
of
foreign
registered
corporations.
what
they
have
looked
to
is
not
the
citizenship
of
the
stockholders
but
to
the
place
where
the
corporation
makes
its
money.
any
other
result
would
result
in
chaos.
if
corporations
were
held
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
place
where
they
paid
dividends
to
their
stockholders
or
to
the
law
of
the
place
where
they
borrowed
the
money
to
finance
their
operations,
this
would
indeed
result
in
chaos
and
do
more
to
blight
international
commerce
in
the
application
of
the
jones
act
to
this
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
that
is
of
course
a
legitimate
invalid
way
of
looking
at
it
but
the
money
is
paid
in
new
york
city,
that's
where
the
checks
or
the
credits
are
forwarded.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well,
i
would
clarify
it
in
order
to
maintain
and
say
that
it
is
the
base
of
operation
or
the
commercial
domicile.
the
place
where
the
corporation
carries
on
its
principal
business
and
when
i
said
the
place
where
it
makes
money,
i
meant
the
place
where
it
does
what
it
has
to
do
to
make
the
money.
he's
running
ships
from
new
york.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
started
off
buying
five
but
then
apparently
he
is
a
very
intelligent
operator
and
he
made
enough
money
to
build
up
to
a
fleet
of
what
now
totals
approximately
40
ships
which
has
been
built
all
over
the
world.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
it
would
depend
on
the
place
from
which
he
run
it
to
my
way
of
thinking.
it
would
depend
--
if
we
are
to
look
at
the
corporations
and
ask
--
in
other
words,
if
we
only
look
at
this
corporate
façade
and
ask
what
is
the
allegiance
of
this
corporations,
i
would
say
it
is
the
place
where
the
corporations
do
their
business
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
to
look
at
the
individual,
i
think
we
should
do
what
this
court
did
in
the
lauritzen
case
and
that
is
look
to
the
national
allegiance
of
this
individual
shipowner
and
i've
cited
a
body
of
law
of
what
i
think
is
impressive
universality
and
maturity
going
back
150
years
according
to
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
of
nations,
a
man's
national
allegiance
is
deemed
to
be
to
that
nation
where
he
has
his
domicile
because
domicile
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
national
character
susceptible
of
course
at
all
times
to
explanations.
if
it
be
for
a
special
purpose
and
transient
in
its
nature
then
it
does
not
derogate
from
or
destroy
the
prior
or
original
national
character
but
if
it
be
taken
up
with
the
intention
of
remaining
as
here,
then
it
substitutes
for
the
original
or
prior
national
character,
the
disabilities
and
penalties
as
well
as
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
united
states
citizen.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
held
that
in
the
case
of
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding
in
which
the
justice
department
attempted
to
deport
without
a
hearing
a
resident
alien
and
he
claimed
that
the
constitutional
privileges
were
available
to
him.
i
see
if
i
may
so
that
the
honorable
mr.
davis
here
represented
the
government
in
that
case
and
your
honor
held
that
even
though
congress
had
never
said
it,
and
the
constitutional
convention
didn't
put
it
in
the
constitution,
your
honor
held
that
the
constitutional
protections
were
available
to
resident
aliens
and
these
cases
which
i've
cited,
have
held
further
resident
aliens
are
subject
to
our
draft
laws.
they
must
pair
all
their
lives
for
the
honor
of
this
country's
defense
even
though
they
are
not
citizens.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
there
is
none
in
the
legislative
history.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
no
there
were
not.
let
me
say
this.
though
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
based
on
language
of
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
lauritzen
case,
he
pointed
that
the
laws
of
this
--
the
shipping
laws
of
this
country
which
are
contained
in
title
46
are
many
and
of
those
very
few
are
specific
in
their
language,
in
their
application
either
to
american
or
foreign
shipping
operations
and
this
is
what
he
said
about
that.
he
said
many
give
no
evidence
that
congress
addressed
itself
to
their
foreign
application
and
are
in
general
terms
which
leave
their
application
to
be
judicially
determined
from
context
and
circumstance.
he
decided
that
where
congress
has
been
silent,
while
it
is
not
--
the
courts
not
only
made
but
they
must
speak
on
what
they
mean
and
then
specifically
with
reference
to
the
jones
act,
he
said
congress
could
not
have
been
unaware
of
the
necessity
of
construction
imposed
upon
courts
by
such
generality
of
language
and
was
well
warned
but
in
the
absence
of
the
more
definite
directions
than
are
contained
in
the
jones
act,
it
would
be
applied
by
the
courts
two
foreign
advanced
ships
and
foreign
seamen
in
accordance
with
the
usual
doctrine
and
practices
of
maritime
law.
so
apparently
congress
has
felt
that
the
courts
must
and
are
able
to
determine
in
each
case
whether
they
are
sufficient
contacts
of
the
united
states
as
weighed
by
the
seven
factors
to
lauritzen
test
to
warrant
or
justify
the
application
to
foreign
transactions
or
not.
so
that
in
effect,
it
has
not
been
necessary
for
congress
to
legislate
on
that.
i
think
it
would
even
be
dangerous
for
congress
to
legislate
on
that
because
these
shipping
operators
--
the
national
symbols
for
which
they
surround
themselves
are
but
part
and
parcel
of
the
paraphernalia
that's
dictated
by
the
exigencies
and
convenience
of
their
economics
and
commerce
and
the
scrambled
types
of
transactions
at
which
we
have
a
wonderful
example
here
are
just
typical.
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
congress
to
comprehend
in
one
act
something
that
would
slice
the
line
between
a
bona
fide
foreign
operator
like
mr.
jay
lauritzen
of
denmark
who
has
always
incidentally
been
a
danish
domiciliary
and
an
operator
like
mr.
pericles
callimanopoulos
who
is
enjoying
the
privileges
and
the
immunities
as
american
citizen
by
living
here.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
do
not
your
honor
and
they
are
certainly
would
not
make
a
matter
of
proof
in
this
case.
let
me
if
i
may
dwell
upon
the
tsakonites
decision
as
your
honors
i
believe
have
been
made
aware,
this
case
comes
to
you
on
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
that
tsakonites
court
decided
on
identical
facts
that
the
jones
act
did
not
apply.
incidentally,
with
regard
to
what
i
contend
as
a
flag
of
convenience
here,
i
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
if
mr.
callimanopoulos
had
just
recently
come
over
here,
--
if
he
had
just
recently
come
here
and
then
only
temporarily
to
get
started,
a
united
states
office
is
merely
a
small
branch
to
a
greek
office
and
they
were
a
continued
and
uninterrupted
use
of
greek
flags
as
part
of
a
principal
business
in
greece
which
is
not
the
case
and
even
your
honor
would
say
that
the
court
of
the
united
states
would
be
stretching
matters
rather
far
to
brand
his
flags
as
flags
of
convenience
but
whereas
here,
there's
an
overwhelming
preponderance
of
contacts
with
the
united
states
as
i've
outlined
and
corporate
registry
in
panama,
it
is
obvious
that
what
this
man
is
doing
is
dictated
by
convenience.
and
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
even
under
these
circumstances,
such
a
flag
is
a
bona
fide
flag,
then
i
would
conclude
that
the
united
states
has
become
a
fair
game
to
a
certain
extent
for
economic
parasites
to
entrust
themselves
like
binnacles
in
the
whole
of
our
maritime
commerce.
but
getting
to
tsakonites,
in
tsakonites,
the
basis
of
the
decision
was,
i
beg
your
pardon,
let
me
say
that
no
case
has
really
set
forth
guidelines
as
to
what
determines
whether
a
flag
is
one
of
convenience
or
not.
our
courts
have
had
no
difficulty
for
instance
in
saying
that
where
american
citizens
domiciled
here
and
operating
ships
from
here,
have
gone
shopping
abroad
in
a
foreign
marketplace
of
flags
and
gotten
a
foreign
flag,
and
such
a
flag
is
obviously
not
a
good
faith
flag
and
on
the
other
hand,
where
it
is
foreign
citizens
with
a
bona
fide
foreign
operation
and
the
foreign
flag
of
the
same
nation,
then
that
is
obviously
a
bona
fide
flag.
but
these
facts
are
in
between
and
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
be
doing
a
service
at
least
to
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
to
tell
us
what
is
the
flag
of
convenience
so
that
never
again
shall
two
circuit
courts
of
appeal
look
at
identical
facts
and
come
up
with
opposite
conclusions
as
the
fifth
and
the
second
have
done
here.
now,
this
was
the
reason
for
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
tsakonites.
it
was
the
law
of
the
contract.
they
conceded
their
own
confusion
as
a
result
of
the
facts.
they
said,
"we
must
concede
that
these
--
this
constellation
of
facts"
and
i'm
only
paraphrasing,
"presents
a
combination
never
before
seen
in
any
other
case
and
they
took
the
easy
but
the
wrong
way
out
and
decided
the
case
on
the
law
of
the
contract
which
as
i
believe
has
been
well
dealt
with
cannot
wag
the
dog,
that's
only
the
tail
and
the
act
of
the
law
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
seven
lauritzen
factors.
i
believe
i
have
also
indicated
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
your
honors
to
decide
that
this
flag
is
one
of
convenience
in
order
to
uphold
the
fifth
circuit
even
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
flag
in
accordance
with
lauritzen,
there
exists
to
it
that
heavy
counterweight
of
the
domicile
and
national
allegiance
of
the
shipowner.
may
i
have
an
alternative
argument
that
the
general
maritime
law
would
be
applicable
here
as
not
being
repugnant
to
the
law
of
greece
under
two
theories.
two
cases
which
i
have
not
cited
in
my
brief,
one
from
this
court,
the
scotland
and
the
other
heredia
versus
davies
held
that
in
matters
of
this
type
where
foreign
law
is
not
proved,
it
may
be
presumed
to
be
the
same
as
the
law
of
the
united
states.
that
being
the
case,
then
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
the
law
of
greece
in
applying
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
$6,000.00
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
this
is
about
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
approximately
one-thirtieth
of
that.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
one
thirtieth.
there
was
a
testimony
in
the
district
court.
i
beg
your
pardon,
he
would
have
been
able
to
get
4800
drachmas,
i
think
it
was
and
that's
divided
by
30,
it's
a
$160.00
which
they
did
pay
him
and
incidentally
that
payment
was
made
to
my
client
after
the
petitioners
were
on
notice
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
this
was
an
attempt
to
label
money
as
part
of
a
foreign
remedy
in
order
to
try
to
determine
applicable
law.
it
was
a
payment
made
to
a
known
represented
claimant.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
he
was.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
that
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
he
received
most
of
that
in
greece
although
he
was
hospitalized
for
approximately
two
weeks
in
the
united
states
but
that
is
a
factor
which
if
i
may
say
has
never
been
given
any
weight
by
any
court.
well,
i
understand.
i
just
asked.
what
were
--
what
were
the
nature
and
extent
of
his
injuries?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
when
i
say
puncture
fractures,
it
was
made
by
broken
chain
lengths,
so
there
were
two
prongs
and
they're
just
punctured
about
half
an
inch
deep
and
just
made
some
chunky
fractures.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
well
a
law
--
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
a
long
time
ago,
this
court,
i
believe
in
the
osceola
decided
that
the
maritime
law
of
nations
at
least
as
far
as
it
applies
to
seamen
is
that
they
have
a
right
of
action
for
damages
for
unseaworthiness
but
since
that
time,
the
general
maritime
law
has
come
to
be
viewed
as
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
whatever
the
international
maritime
law
and
the
law
of
nations
is.
but
i
think
that
that
quotation
taken
in
connection
with
his
dispensing
or
giving
short
shrift
to
the
argument
that
the
interest
of
the
seamen
in
that
case
were
the
interest
of
the
united
states
because
if
he
were
granted
recovery,
it
would
equalize
competition,
this
was
i
believe
mr.
justice
jackson's
way
of
saying
that
we
cannot
consider
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
kind
of
a
contact
--
context
in
order
to
oust
some
applicable
law
of
another
foreign
nation,
of
a
foreign
nation.
mr.
joseph
b.
stahl
thank
you.
