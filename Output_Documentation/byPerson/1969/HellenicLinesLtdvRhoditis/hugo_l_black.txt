justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
whether
your
problem
is
based
on
a
statute
or
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
famous
jones
act
had
some
provision
in
it
that
prevent
this
trial
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
question
one
of
the
jurisdictions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
courts
had
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
some
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
find
something
in
that
statute
that
shows
that
the
case
could
be
tried
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
(voice
overlap)
to
decisions
for
this
court
or
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
relying
on
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
relying
on
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
construing,
well,
that's
difficult.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
relying
basically
on
a
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
say
the
construction
by
this
court
was
different
from
the
statute,
would
you?
you
seem
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
thinking
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
say
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
courts.
our
courts
have
jurisdictions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
they
are
tried
the
case
what
--
would
it
be
governed
by
greek
law
or
by
american
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
altogether?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
man
live
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
trying
to
exercise
it
or
said
he
didn't
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
complaint
in
this
case
based
wholly
on
the
jones
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maritime
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
based
on
the
statute.
well,
your
--
your
prior
argument
is
not
based
on
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
all
the
evidence
and
everything
in
connection
with
the
case
shows
that
that
it
was
thoroughly
inconvenient
to
find
in
a
way
except
in
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
then
that
this
case
--
this
court
might
not
have
or
merely
have
jurisdiction
but
might
have
the
power
to
try
and
probably
and
could
be
of
should
be
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
injury
will
it
do
to
the
defendant
to
try
a
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
based
on
the
fact
that
he
thinks
he
made
a
mistake,
he
can
get
a
better
remedy
in
greece.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
he
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
greece.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
statute
does
not
provide
automatically,
if
he
cannot
possibly
have
a
remedy
in
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
a
question
of
discretion
in
each
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
that
the
greek
remedy
is
better
but
maybe
the
man
who
is
hurt
doesn't
think
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
you
adversary
agree
with
you
here
that
it
will
be
better
if
he's
tried
to
have
his
case
tried
in
greece?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you're
not
--
you're
not
standing
here
firm
in
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
sometimes
you
mean.
you
don't
mean
always
under
all
circumstances,
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
will
be
better
to
decline
if
it's
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
part
of
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
this
will
be
better
for
this
man
to
sue
in
greece.
how
do
you
explain
this
suing
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
end
of
(inaudible),
you
mean
the
owner
of
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
the
ship
built?
justice
hugo
l.
black
99
and
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
only
owns
99%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
panama
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
be
an
american
citizen
at
organizing
corporation,
99%
of
the
stock
and
what
do
they
do
for
panama,
what
they
get
from
panama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
he
been
a
resident
of
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
the
owner
of
this
other
1%
of
the
stock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
his
son
live?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
a
greek
national
who
chooses
to
live
in
this
country
with
his
family.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
his
contacts
with
the
greek
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
buys
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
his
contacts
with
panama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there's
no
corporation
that
was
organized
in
panama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
panamanian
corporation
owned
by
the
man
99%,
his
son,
the
other
1%,
it
does
--
didn't
premier
in
greece,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
does
he
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
ship
any
from
greece?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
has
nice
paper
relationship
with
greece,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
is
the
theory
that
causes
this
to
be
called
a
greek
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
theory
was
this
called
a
greek
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
could
fly
a
panamanian
flag,
couldn't
it,
i
guess?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
how
many
of
these
liberty
ships
he
had
bought
from
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
this
gentleman
had
determined
instead
of
organizing
a
corporation
on
paper
somewhere
in
panama
or
i
believe
anywhere
around
the
world,
just
to
run
it
himself
like
he's
actually
doing
with
his
son,
what
would
have
been
the
law
of
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
statistics
on
the
number
of
ships
bought
from
the
american
government
on
five
terms
that
operate
under
panamanian
registry
although
they
do
all
their
business
practices
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
true
here
though,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
99%
was
owned
by
one
man
who
lives
in
this
country
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
1%
by
his
son.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
lives
in
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
his
business
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
been
living
here
many
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
about
the
contract?
suppose
the
government
--
the
federal
law
did
govern
our
law,
when
this
man
was
to
make
his
contract,
they
have
said,
"well,
you
got
to
sign
this
contract
which
agrees
that
we
will
not
owe
you
any
money
under
your
american
law,"
would
that
have
been
valid
under
america?
justice

it
would
not
be
valid.
justice

black
that's
