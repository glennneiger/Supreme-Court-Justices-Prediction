mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
presenting
the
question
whether
illinois
statutes
which
authorize
a
pauper’s
incarceration
in
excess
of
the
maximum
period
prescribed
by
law,
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day
for
payment
of
fine
and
court
costs.
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
willing
and
able
to
pay
them,
if
given
the
opportunity,
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
are
briefly
as
follows:
the
complaint
was
issued
in
june
of
1967
against
willie
williams
for
the
crime
of
theft
of
property
not
from
the
person,
and
not
exceeding
$150.00
in
value.
a
warrant
was
issued
and
a
$2000.00
bail
was
set.
williams
was
arrested
on
august
13.
the
case
was
brought
before
the
court
the
following
day
on
august
14
at
which
at
the
time
bail
was
set
at
$2000.00.
williams
was
remanded
to
jail
on
motion
of
the
state,
the
case
was
continued
to
august
16.
on
august
16,
the
case
was
again
continued
on
motion
of
the
state
to
september
6.
on
september
6,
the
trial
commenced.
the
defendant
appeared
in
the
court
said,
there
was
no
court
reporter
present.
the
record
shows
that
the
defendant
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
case
was
tried
before
the
judge
without
a
jury.
finding
of
guilty
was
made
and
the
maximum
of
sentence
of
one
year
plus
a
$500.00
fine
was
imposed.
the
$5.00
cost
was
also
made
part
of
the
judgment.
and
the
judgment
further
ordered
that
the
defendant
stand
committed
in
jail,
if
he
would
default
from
the
payment
of
the
fine
and
cost.
sometime
afterward
the
defendant
contacted
the
civil
legal
aid
service
in
the
jail
and
a
petition
was
presented
to
the
sentencing
judge,
november
of
1967,
which
prayed
that
the
portion
of
the
sentencing
order
of
september
6,
which
directed
that
the
defendants
stand
committed
in
default
of
payment
of
the
fine
and
cost
be
vacated.
that
further
prayed
that
the
defendant
be
granted
sufficient
time
and
wish
to
obtain
the
funds
and
wish
to
pay
the
fine
and
cost
and
further
asked
for
such
other
relief
as
maybe
just
inappropriate.
the
petition
was
made
under
oath
and
contained
some
of
the
following
allegations,
that
defendant
was
indigent,
inmate
of
the
county
jail.
he
had
no
funds,
no
valuable
property.
he
had
been
unable
to
post
bail.
he
lacked
$200.00,
wished
to
post
the
10%
under
the
illinois
law.
he
was
unable
to
hire
an
attorney
and
that
he
was
then
unable
to
pay
the
fine
and
cost.
he
further
recited
that
he
had
been
in
jail
since
august
13
and
had
been
unable
to
earn
funds
since
that
time.
and
it
further
alleged
that
if
the
defendant
were
released
from
jail
upon
the
expiration
of
the
one-year
jail
sentence
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
a
job
and
earn
the
funds
to
pay
the
fine
and
costs.
the
state
did
not
contravene
the
factual
allegation
but
moved
to
dismiss.
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
petition
without
evidentiary
hearing
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
when
an
indigent
defendant
is
imprisoned
to
satisfy
payment
of
his
fine.
the
illinois
supreme
court
granted
a
stayed
pending
appeal,
and
for
the
stayed
the
mandate
pending
appeal
to
this
court.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
what
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
we
do
not
challenge
the
practice
of
incarcerating
contumacious
defendant
who
refuses
to
pay
the
fine
nor
do
we
attack
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judges
who
wish
to
make
the
punishment
for
the
offender,
nor
do
we
attack
defendant's
obligation
to
pay
that
debt,
nor
do
we
attack
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
total
sentence
would
be
one
year,
plus
101
days,
which
would
be
the
$505.00
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
about
a
year
and
three
months,
yes.
that
was
diminished
slightly
by
the
good-time
credits.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
a
possible
question.
we
did
not
urge
the
right
to
counsel
the
question
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
it
was
doubtful
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
would
succeed
in
that
because
under
illinois
law,
the
right
to
counsel
depends
upon
a
request
for
counsel.
secondly,
the
possibility
was
substantial
that
if
there
had
been
a
retrial,
or
would
have
been
a
reconviction
with
the
same
sentence,
which
would
only
have
resulted
in
the
issue
coming
up
at
a
later
stage,
and
possibly
the
defendant
is
spending
more
time
in
jail
than
he
did
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
for
theft
of
property,
not
from
the
person
and
not
exceeding
of
$150.00
in
value
was
one
year
plus
a
$500.00
fine.
if
the
person
commits
a
subsequent
offense,
it's
a
felony,
one
to
five
years,
if
he
commits
theft
of
property
from
the
person
or
exceeding
$150.00
in
value
is
1:10.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
this
came
in
the
lowest,
the
misdemeanor
of
one
year
plus
$500.00.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
how
long
would
he
actually
be?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
was
bailed
out
after
serving
five
days
of
the
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
served
the
full
sentence
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence,
he
asked
for
bail
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
five
days
after,
he
began
serving
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
think
he
received
approximately
84
days,
which
is
a
normal
good
time
credit.
so
it
would
be
a
year
plus
five
days
minus
84,
which
would
be
the
period
from
august
of
1967
to
may
of
1968,
about
nine
months.
what
we
do
challenge
in
this
case
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
authorizes
24-hour
a
day
imprisonment
over
the
maximum
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day,
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
said
without
any
opposition
by
the
state
that
he
will
go
out
and
get
a
job,
and
earn
the
funds
to
pay
his
fine
if
he
is
given
the
opportunity.
the
state
has
indicated
that
it
has
two
primary
goals
to
be
served,
the
practice
of
incarceration
of
indigence
should
be
sustained
because
of
those
goals.
those
are
deterrence
of
crime
and
collection
of
revenue
from
the
fines.
but
whatever
the
examination
reveals
that
round-the-clock
imprisonment
of
an
indigent
under
these
circumstances
is
neither
necessary
nor
rationally
related
to
the
stated
goals
and
that
there
are
clearly
less
onerous
alternatives
and
perhaps
more
effective
ones
to
satisfy
the
state's
interest.
certainly,
if
the
state's
interest
is
in
collecting
the
revenue
by
remitting
the
person
to
jail,
they're
not
going
to
get
the
money.
and
in
addition,
the
state
has
to
pay
substantial
amount
of
money
to
house
prisoners
in
already
overcrowded
and
overburdened
facilities.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
state
could
certainly
do
that
as
long
they
let
him
go
at
night.
in
a
hierarchy
of
alternatives
that
we
have
suggested,
we
have
placed
remitting
to
the
work
house
as
one
of
the
possibilities,
but
the
problem
is
in
this
case,
that
they
keep
the
man
in
jail
around
the
clock
and
there's
absolutely
no
justification
for
incarcerating
somebody
at
night
merely
because
they're
extracting
his
day
life,
that's
wrong.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
feel
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
easily
have
saved
the
statute
by
construction.
for
example,
the
first
provision
--
the
first
sentence
in
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
a
judgment
of
a
fine
imposed
upon
a
defendant,
maybe
enforced
in
the
same
manner
as
a
judgment
entered
the
civil
action.
just
last
november,
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
civil
case.
it
could
not
obtain
the
body
execution
that
is
jail
to
facilitate.
absence
of
showing
or
refusal
to
pay,
that's
the
lawyer's
title
of
phoenix
versus
gerber,
which
we
said
in
footnote
19
on
page
22.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
the
illinois
supreme
court
does
not
treat
imprisonment
as
a
result
of
a
conviction
as
a
debt
which
is
considered
within
that
prohibition.
but
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
construed
the
section,
to
require
resort
to
the
other
alternatives
before
remitting
the
person
immediately,
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
have
avoided
the
constitutional
infirmity
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
if
he
goes
home
at
night,
i
think
there
maybe
some
question
about
whether
or
not
$5.00
a
day
comports
with
a
reasonable
rate.
but
certainly,
$5.00
a
day
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
do
raise
it.
but
what
we
have
it
in
this
case
is
$5.00
a
day
not
for
the
workday
but
the
pleasure
of
his
company
during
the
night
as
well,
and
that
certainly,
under
those
circumstances,
that's
certainly
not
compensatory,
certainly
unjust
compensation
for
--
not
only
taking
his
labors
during
the
day
but
having
him
around
at
night
too
against
his
will.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
had
originally
suggested
that
the
alternative
of
allowing
the
man
to
go
out
on
his
own
is
to
be
preferred.
but
we're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
there
maybe
situations
where
a
person
is
unable
to
get
a
job,
where
the
state
is
unable
to
get
a
job
for
him,
do
an
employment
service.
and
as
a
last
resort,
the
state
might
want
to
give
him
the
public
works
program,
the
job.
they
could
make
him
work
at
the
hospital
or
a
boy's
club
or
at
the
work
farm.
but
our
point
is
what
the
state
has
done
is
much
more
onerous
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
illinois
does
not
imprisonment
for
nonpayment
of
cost
in
civil
case.
it
will
clearly
have
an
irrational
discrimination
here.
one
can
hardly
think
that
costs
are
necessary
to
enforce
a
criminal
law.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that.
but
i
can
envision
the
possibility
where
after
an
adequate
inquiry
is
made,
it's
determined
that
there's
very,
very,
real
probability
that
they
let
him
out
to
go
to
the
job
during
the
day
and
they'll
never
see
him
again.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
if
he
refuses
to
work,
that
might
well
be
the
contumacious
type
of
conduct
that
could
lead
to
remitting
him
to
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
not
as
a
substitute
for
a
fine
but
as
a
means
of
collection
or
as
a
means
of
getting
him
to
be
willing
to
go
and
work.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
state
can
provide
the
job.
if
he
absolutely
sits
down
at
the
job
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
he
absolutely
refuses
to
work,
that
is
contumacious
conduct.
that's
a
complete
refusal
to
be
cooperative.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
under
those
circumstances,
the
state
might
do,
but
it
does
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
the
funds
and
that
is
say,
you
sit
unless
you
work
or
pay.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
but
not
under
the
illinois
statute.
that's
the
problem.
no
provision
has
made
for
any
kind
of
inquiry
or
hearing
or
factual
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
refusing
to
pay
or
refusing
to
work,
refusing
to
comply
with
his
obligation.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
our
position
is
that--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
our
position
is
that
where
liberty
is
involve,
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
utilize
alternatives
rather
than
automatic
remission
to
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
alternatives
that
we
would
suggest
would
be
first,
straight
installment
payments.
an
economy
that's
based
upon
time
payment,
that's
certainly
not
strange.
secondly,
garnishment,
that
is
once
he
goes
out,
automatically
seize
a
portion.
third,
possibility
is
to
utilize
a
state
employment
service
to
find
a
job
for
him.
the
last
one
would
be
to
put
him
on
the
public
works
job,
whether
that
would
be
out
in
the
farm
or
out
in
the
workhouse.
that's
the
last
the
last
one.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
think
that
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
there
is
no
work
at
all
these
days,
but
if
it
were
shown
--
evidence
did
show
that
it
was
impossible
to
place
him
anywhere,
we
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
require
him
to
work
at
a
designated
place
during
the
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
interest
of
the
society
do
not
justify
such
as
onerous
exaction,
such
an
imposition
upon
the
liberty
of
the
defendant.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
state
which
talks
in
terms
of
these
alternatives
really
administratively
feasible
for
a
stance
of
cost
is
that
administrative
convenience
is
not
a
sufficient
ground
for
such
an
onerous
exaction.
but
the
second
one
is
that
illinois,
by
passing
a
work
release
program
has
itself
recognized
that
these
alternatives
are
feasible.
of
course,
there's
one
glaring
defect
in
the
illinois
work
release
program
as
applied
to
the
person
who
is
incarcerated
for
nonpayment
of
fine.
that's
triple
punishment.
defendant
is
required
to
serve
his
year
in
jail,
pay
his
fine
with
the
earnings
he
gets
during
the
day
but
he
sits
in
jail
at
night.
and
there's
absolutely
no
justification
why
a
person
should
have
to
sit
in
jail
at
night
when
he
is
out
there
during
the
day
working
off
his
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
it
applies
to
straight
jail
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
right,
let
me
explain
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
with
respect
to
a
person
who
is
doing
a
straight
jail
sentence,
he's
certainly
receiving
quite
a
benefit
to
be
told
that
he
can
obtain
some
liberty
during
the
day
and
he
can
hardly
complain
of
that.
but
the
person
who
is
being
incarcerated
for
nonpayment
of
fine,
the
only
interest
that
the
state
has
is
his
money.
when
they
let
him
go
out
during
the
day
to
get
that
money,
may
then
have
completely
undermined
that
by
saying
he
must
come
back
to
jail
at
night.
there
is
no
rational
justification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
williams?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he's
out.
he
was
bailed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
to
williams,
of
course,
the
work
release
program
was
passed
by
the
legislature
effective
january
1969
and
all
of
the
williams
proceedings
occurred
in
1967.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
in
the
event
that
it
were
applicable
to
him
or
other
persons
similarly
situated
what
the
effect
would
be,
and
my
point
was
that
the
work
release
statute
shows
that
the
administrative
convenience
argument
doesn't
hold
up.
and
secondly,
that
there's
a
glaring
defect
in
it
because
it
requires
night
time
incarceration
so
which
does
no
rational
justification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
adds
in
injury
by
making
a
$3.50
a
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
certainly
thought
that
the
language
of
the
statute
could
be
interpreted
literarily
and
would
be
granted
for
discharge.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
they've
construed
the
language
until
all
the
legal
means
have
been
exhausted
to
mean
that
the
defendant
either
must
show,
he's
physically
unable
to
work
which
is
the
goldstones
case
and
people
versus
hardenbergh.
or
that
no
work
is
provided
for
him.
now,
there's
always
housekeeping
available.
in
fact,
the
record
shows,
the
jail
record
of
williams
is
included
in
here
on
page
33
of
the
record.
and
it
does
show
that
when
he
was
serving
his
jail
time,
he
worked
in
the
laundry
and
he
worked
in
the
tailor
shop
and
he
worked
in
something
beginning
with
'k'
which
i
think
is
the
kitchen.
so
that,
all
people
that
are
in
jail
have
the
opportunity
to
work.
so
person
who
is
serving
off
or
working
off
a
fine
is
not
going
to
be
doing
anything
differently.
the
state
has
attempted
to
suggest
that
the
policy
of
deterrence
requires
the
result
reached
in
this
case.
we
dispute
that
contention
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
fact
the
illinois
is
going
under
180-6
to
discharge
a
persons
who
are
unable
to
work
or
for
whom
no
work
is
provided
is
an
indication
that
automatic
incarceration
of
everybody
who
don't
pay
fines,
not
necessary
to
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
we
submit
that
the
fine
is
certainly
a
different
order
of
punishment
than
a
jail
sentence.
if
the
trial
judge
wishes
to
individualize
the
sentence,
imposed
a
fine
because
he
feels
that
the
interest
of
society
require
no
more
than
a
fine.
it's
inconsistent
with
that
trial
judge's
determination
then
to
have
the
defendant
sitting
in
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
really
a
blend
of
equal
protection
and
due
process,
almost
all
of
this
court's
criminal
procedure
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
frame
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
indigent
is
required
to
spend
more
jail
time
than
the
person
with
funds.
the
fact
the
indigent
defendant
despite
his
willingness
to
work
is
deprived
that
the
opportunity
to
payoff
the
fine
but
rather
remitted
to
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
there
is
more
to
it
than
that.
there
is
a
due
process
aspect
to
this
extent
that
the
state
seems
to
be
conclusively
presuming
that
incarceration
is
necessary
because
the
person
might
run
away
and
they
lose
the
risk,
so
to
speak,
and
he'll
run
away
from
the
job
and
he
won't
be
around
to
pay
the
fine.
that
type
conclusive
presumption
in
the
absence
any
showing,
any
hearing,
any
inquiry,
certainly
doesn't
comport
with
fundamental
principles.
so,
to
that
extent,
there
is
this
blend
of
due
process
into
the
equal
protection.
the
state's
attempt
to
justify
this
24-hour
day
incarceration
for
fear
that
some
people
might
skip
is
not
based
upon
any
evidence.
certainly,
not
in
this
record
and
i
take
it
the
state
this
arguing
in
a
broad
proposition
that
they're
entitled
to
incarcerate
somebody
around
the
clock
in
any
case
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
felon
may
come
in
and
say,
“well,
look,
i
have
great
possibility
of
getting
a
job.
i
could
earn
enough
funds
in
perhaps
a
week
or
two
to
pay
off
this
fine.”
but
--
and
the
state
says,
it
wants
the
revenue
from
collecting
these
fines,
and
yet
that
state
does
precisely
by
incarcerating
the
person
and
depriving
him
the
opportunity
to
go
out
to
work.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
clearly,
the
evaluation
is
a
legislative
matter.
however,
there
is
a
point
when
24-hour
incarceration
for
$5.00
a
day
is
so
obviously
unjust
compensation
as
to
render
it
on
constitution
because
we
have
to
remember
that
the
defendant
here
is
being
kept
for
longer
than
the
work
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
remission
to
incarceration
at
a
certain
value
is
the
last
resort.
it's
our
submission
in
this
case
that
the
state
should
have
done
something
before
they
resort
to
that
alternative.
and
the
state
didn't.
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
said
he
could
go
and
get
the
money
on
his
own,
the
state
wouldn't
have
to
keep
him
in
jail
and
to
work
off
the
fine
at
whatever
value
they
assigned.
he
said
that
he
could
go
out
and
get
that
money.
and
the
state
instead
of
even
inquiring
into
the
credibility
of
the
weights
of
those
contentions
which
the
state
did
not
meet
simply
denied
the
petition
without
evidentiary
hearing.
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
rather
than
adopt
the
type
of
construction
that
could
save
the
statute,
simply
said,
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
when
an
indigent
is
required
to
work
off
his
fine.
the
heart
of
this
thing
is
that
there
is
no
equivalent
between
the
rich
man's
choice
that
is
whether
anyone
is
to
pay
or
sit
in
jail
and
there
are
some
people
who
would
like
to
do
that.
and
the
exactions
on
the
indigent
requiring
him
to
sit
in
jail,
that
is
simply
an
inequality
and
that
is
(inaudible).
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
don't
think
i
will
use
that
up,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
traffic
courts
have
utilized
the
fines
as
a
method
of
keeping
the
system
supported.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
traffic
courts
are
going
to
change
their
practices
overnight.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
we're
entitled
to
trust
the
trial
judges'
discretion.
if
they
want
to
individualize
the
sentence,
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so.
if
they
think
that
a
fine
is
called
for
rather
than
imprisonment,
they
will
impose
a
fine.
if
they
feel
that
incarceration
is
called
for,
they
will
impose
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
potential
is
there
but
i
think
we
have
to
test
the
courts.
i
think
the
potential
will
not
be
realized.
i
did
want
to
make
an
observation
with
respect
to
the
state's
complaint
that
they'll
have
difficulty
administering
these
evidentiary
hearings
going
to
the
financial
ability
of
the
defendant.
i'd
always
thought
that
was
a
basic
principle
of
american
law
that
it's
not
better
to
let
a
man
rot
in
jail
because
it
was
easier
for
the
state's
administrative
machinery
to
have
to
dispense
with
hearings.
but
besides,
the
lower
court
judges
right
now,
under
the
illinois
statutes
conduct
inquiries
into
the
defendant's
background,
etcetera
in
setting
bail.
there's
a
statute
right
now
that
requires
such
inquiries,
so
i
don't
understand
how
the
state
is
going
to
be
put
to
any
substantially
greater
hearings
that
it
engages
in
right
now.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
not
an
equivalent,
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
if
the
state
feels
that
he
cannot
pay,
they
still
must
do
something
less
than
putting
him
in
jail.
a
fine
is
not
the
equivalent
of
jail.
that
is
obvious
and
if
the
state
wants
to
get
the
revenue,
there
are
ways
of
collecting
it.
if
the
state
feels
that
a
fine
is
the
type
of
punishment,
that's
different
from
jail.
if
that's
appropriate,
then
that's
the
punishment
that
the
state
should
stick
to.
we're
not
telling
the
trial
judges
what
to
do.
we're
simply
talking
about
the
manner
in
which
the
state
gets
that
exaction.
if
the
judge
determines
money
is
the
sanction
that
should
be
the
sanction.
i
did
want
to
point
to
a
reference
in
terms
of
cost,
it
was
estimated
that
in
the
city
of
chicago
between
1907
and
1921,
when
prison
costs
were
relatively
low,
the
city
lost
$5
million
in
uncollected
fines
and
incurred
an
additional
expense
in
prison
maintenance
of
$5
million,
a
total
cost
of
$10
million.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
don't
have
those
figures.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
traffic
courts
have
been
granting
installments
on
some
occasions
but
i
don't
have
the
exact
figures.
but
in
terms
of
the
cost
problem,
the
economics
of
it
is
not
so
clear
at
all
that
the
state
will
be
bankrupted
by
a
ruling.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
to
the
extent
to
which
the
offense
is
punishable
by
fine
only,
we
would
be
dealing
with
the
situation
of
poor
people
being
subjected
to
a
sanction
different
from
the
sanction
as
to
rich
people.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
but
we
would
submit
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
would
submit
that
if
the
judge
determines
that
--
well,
first
of
all,
if
the
offense
is
serious
enough
to
warrant
incarceration
of
an
individual
would
seem
to
underlie
a
lot
of
these,
letting
an
indigence
to
get
away
with
violating
the
law
with
impunity.
this
legislature
has
the
ability
to
set
up
imprisonment
as
an
alternative
but
if
the
offense
is
not
serious
enough
to
require
an
exaction
greater
than
the
fine,
there's
not
justification
for
putting
people
in
jail
simply
because
they
don't
have
the
way
with
all
to
pay
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
possible
that
the
legislature
has
always
had
the
discretion
to
determine
what
penalties
are
appropriate
for
what
offenses
but
we're
talking
about
this
situation
is
an
automatic
system
that
puts
people
in
jail
without
any
inquiry
whatsoever
as
to
whether
or
not
the
money,
that
the
state
says
is
the
appropriate
sanction,
the
fine,
can
be
satisfied
in
the
means
less
onerous.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
legislature
has
not,
according
to
the
construction
put
on
the
statute
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
legislature
has
not
allowed
these
alternatives
to
work.
the
legislature
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
that's
what
they've
said.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
but
our
point
is
that
the
legislature
may
unconstitutionally
do
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
legislature
may
prescribe
maximum
penalties,
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
presenting
the
question
whether
illinois
statutes
which
authorize
a
pauper’s
incarceration
in
excess
of
the
maximum
period
prescribed
by
law,
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day
for
payment
of
fine
and
court
costs.
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
willing
and
able
to
pay
them,
if
given
the
opportunity,
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
which
are
undisputed
are
briefly
as
follows:
the
complaint
was
issued
in
june
of
1967
against
willie
williams
for
the
crime
of
theft
of
property
not
from
the
person,
and
not
exceeding
$150.00
in
value.
a
warrant
was
issued
and
a
$2000.00
bail
was
set.
williams
was
arrested
on
august
13.
the
case
was
brought
before
the
court
the
following
day
on
august
14
at
which
at
the
time
bail
was
set
at
$2000.00.
williams
was
remanded
to
jail
on
motion
of
the
state,
the
case
was
continued
to
august
16.
on
august
16,
the
case
was
again
continued
on
motion
of
the
state
to
september
6.
on
september
6,
the
trial
commenced.
the
defendant
appeared
in
the
court
said,
there
was
no
court
reporter
present.
the
record
shows
that
the
defendant
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
case
was
tried
before
the
judge
without
a
jury.
finding
of
guilty
was
made
and
the
maximum
of
sentence
of
one
year
plus
a
$500.00
fine
was
imposed.
the
$5.00
cost
was
also
made
part
of
the
judgment.
and
the
judgment
further
ordered
that
the
defendant
stand
committed
in
jail,
if
he
would
default
from
the
payment
of
the
fine
and
cost.
sometime
afterward
the
defendant
contacted
the
civil
legal
aid
service
in
the
jail
and
a
petition
was
presented
to
the
sentencing
judge,
november
of
1967,
which
prayed
that
the
portion
of
the
sentencing
order
of
september
6,
which
directed
that
the
defendants
stand
committed
in
default
of
payment
of
the
fine
and
cost
be
vacated.
that
further
prayed
that
the
defendant
be
granted
sufficient
time
and
wish
to
obtain
the
funds
and
wish
to
pay
the
fine
and
cost
and
further
asked
for
such
other
relief
as
maybe
just
inappropriate.
the
petition
was
made
under
oath
and
contained
some
of
the
following
allegations,
that
defendant
was
indigent,
inmate
of
the
county
jail.
he
had
no
funds,
no
valuable
property.
he
had
been
unable
to
post
bail.
he
lacked
$200.00,
wished
to
post
the
10%
under
the
illinois
law.
he
was
unable
to
hire
an
attorney
and
that
he
was
then
unable
to
pay
the
fine
and
cost.
he
further
recited
that
he
had
been
in
jail
since
august
13
and
had
been
unable
to
earn
funds
since
that
time.
and
it
further
alleged
that
if
the
defendant
were
released
from
jail
upon
the
expiration
of
the
one-year
jail
sentence
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
a
job
and
earn
the
funds
to
pay
the
fine
and
costs.
the
state
did
not
contravene
the
factual
allegation
but
moved
to
dismiss.
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
petition
without
evidentiary
hearing
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
when
an
indigent
defendant
is
imprisoned
to
satisfy
payment
of
his
fine.
the
illinois
supreme
court
granted
a
stayed
pending
appeal,
and
for
the
stayed
the
mandate
pending
appeal
to
this
court.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
what
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
we
do
not
challenge
the
practice
of
incarcerating
contumacious
defendant
who
refuses
to
pay
the
fine
nor
do
we
attack
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judges
who
wish
to
make
the
punishment
for
the
offender,
nor
do
we
attack
defendant's
obligation
to
pay
that
debt,
nor
do
we
attack
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
total
sentence
would
be
one
year,
plus
101
days,
which
would
be
the
$505.00
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
about
a
year
and
three
months,
yes.
that
was
diminished
slightly
by
the
good-time
credits.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
a
possible
question.
we
did
not
urge
the
right
to
counsel
the
question
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
it
was
doubtful
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
would
succeed
in
that
because
under
illinois
law,
the
right
to
counsel
depends
upon
a
request
for
counsel.
secondly,
the
possibility
was
substantial
that
if
there
had
been
a
retrial,
or
would
have
been
a
reconviction
with
the
same
sentence,
which
would
only
have
resulted
in
the
issue
coming
up
at
a
later
stage,
and
possibly
the
defendant
is
spending
more
time
in
jail
than
he
did
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
for
theft
of
property,
not
from
the
person
and
not
exceeding
of
$150.00
in
value
was
one
year
plus
a
$500.00
fine.
if
the
person
commits
a
subsequent
offense,
it's
a
felony,
one
to
five
years,
if
he
commits
theft
of
property
from
the
person
or
exceeding
$150.00
in
value
is
1:10.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
this
came
in
the
lowest,
the
misdemeanor
of
one
year
plus
$500.00.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
how
long
would
he
actually
be?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
he
was
bailed
out
after
serving
five
days
of
the
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
served
the
full
sentence
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence,
he
asked
for
bail
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
five
days
after,
he
began
serving
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
think
he
received
approximately
84
days,
which
is
a
normal
good
time
credit.
so
it
would
be
a
year
plus
five
days
minus
84,
which
would
be
the
period
from
august
of
1967
to
may
of
1968,
about
nine
months.
what
we
do
challenge
in
this
case
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
authorizes
24-hour
a
day
imprisonment
over
the
maximum
at
the
rate
of
$5.00
a
day,
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
said
without
any
opposition
by
the
state
that
he
will
go
out
and
get
a
job,
and
earn
the
funds
to
pay
his
fine
if
he
is
given
the
opportunity.
the
state
has
indicated
that
it
has
two
primary
goals
to
be
served,
the
practice
of
incarceration
of
indigence
should
be
sustained
because
of
those
goals.
those
are
deterrence
of
crime
and
collection
of
revenue
from
the
fines.
but
whatever
the
examination
reveals
that
round-the-clock
imprisonment
of
an
indigent
under
these
circumstances
is
neither
necessary
nor
rationally
related
to
the
stated
goals
and
that
there
are
clearly
less
onerous
alternatives
and
perhaps
more
effective
ones
to
satisfy
the
state's
interest.
certainly,
if
the
state's
interest
is
in
collecting
the
revenue
by
remitting
the
person
to
jail,
they're
not
going
to
get
the
money.
and
in
addition,
the
state
has
to
pay
substantial
amount
of
money
to
house
prisoners
in
already
overcrowded
and
overburdened
facilities.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
state
could
certainly
do
that
as
long
they
let
him
go
at
night.
in
a
hierarchy
of
alternatives
that
we
have
suggested,
we
have
placed
remitting
to
the
work
house
as
one
of
the
possibilities,
but
the
problem
is
in
this
case,
that
they
keep
the
man
in
jail
around
the
clock
and
there's
absolutely
no
justification
for
incarcerating
somebody
at
night
merely
because
they're
extracting
his
day
life,
that's
wrong.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
feel
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
easily
have
saved
the
statute
by
construction.
for
example,
the
first
provision
--
the
first
sentence
in
the
statute
talks
in
terms
of
a
judgment
of
a
fine
imposed
upon
a
defendant,
maybe
enforced
in
the
same
manner
as
a
judgment
entered
the
civil
action.
just
last
november,
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
civil
case.
it
could
not
obtain
the
body
execution
that
is
jail
to
facilitate.
absence
of
showing
or
refusal
to
pay,
that's
the
lawyer's
title
of
phoenix
versus
gerber,
which
we
said
in
footnote
19
on
page
22.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
the
illinois
supreme
court
does
not
treat
imprisonment
as
a
result
of
a
conviction
as
a
debt
which
is
considered
within
that
prohibition.
but
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
construed
the
section,
to
require
resort
to
the
other
alternatives
before
remitting
the
person
immediately,
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
have
avoided
the
constitutional
infirmity
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
if
he
goes
home
at
night,
i
think
there
maybe
some
question
about
whether
or
not
$5.00
a
day
comports
with
a
reasonable
rate.
but
certainly,
$5.00
a
day
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
do
raise
it.
but
what
we
have
it
in
this
case
is
$5.00
a
day
not
for
the
workday
but
the
pleasure
of
his
company
during
the
night
as
well,
and
that
certainly,
under
those
circumstances,
that's
certainly
not
compensatory,
certainly
unjust
compensation
for
--
not
only
taking
his
labors
during
the
day
but
having
him
around
at
night
too
against
his
will.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
had
originally
suggested
that
the
alternative
of
allowing
the
man
to
go
out
on
his
own
is
to
be
preferred.
but
we're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
there
maybe
situations
where
a
person
is
unable
to
get
a
job,
where
the
state
is
unable
to
get
a
job
for
him,
do
an
employment
service.
and
as
a
last
resort,
the
state
might
want
to
give
him
the
public
works
program,
the
job.
they
could
make
him
work
at
the
hospital
or
a
boy's
club
or
at
the
work
farm.
but
our
point
is
what
the
state
has
done
is
much
more
onerous
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
illinois
does
not
imprisonment
for
nonpayment
of
cost
in
civil
case.
it
will
clearly
have
an
irrational
discrimination
here.
one
can
hardly
think
that
costs
are
necessary
to
enforce
a
criminal
law.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that.
but
i
can
envision
the
possibility
where
after
an
adequate
inquiry
is
made,
it's
determined
that
there's
very,
very,
real
probability
that
they
let
him
out
to
go
to
the
job
during
the
day
and
they'll
never
see
him
again.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
if
he
refuses
to
work,
that
might
well
be
the
contumacious
type
of
conduct
that
could
lead
to
remitting
him
to
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
not
as
a
substitute
for
a
fine
but
as
a
means
of
collection
or
as
a
means
of
getting
him
to
be
willing
to
go
and
work.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
state
can
provide
the
job.
if
he
absolutely
sits
down
at
the
job
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
he
absolutely
refuses
to
work,
that
is
contumacious
conduct.
that's
a
complete
refusal
to
be
cooperative.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
under
those
circumstances,
the
state
might
do,
but
it
does
with
respect
to
a
person
who
has
the
funds
and
that
is
say,
you
sit
unless
you
work
or
pay.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
but
not
under
the
illinois
statute.
that's
the
problem.
no
provision
has
made
for
any
kind
of
inquiry
or
hearing
or
factual
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
refusing
to
pay
or
refusing
to
work,
refusing
to
comply
with
his
obligation.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
our
position
is
that--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
our
position
is
that
where
liberty
is
involve,
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
utilize
alternatives
rather
than
automatic
remission
to
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
alternatives
that
we
would
suggest
would
be
first,
straight
installment
payments.
an
economy
that's
based
upon
time
payment,
that's
certainly
not
strange.
secondly,
garnishment,
that
is
once
he
goes
out,
automatically
seize
a
portion.
third,
possibility
is
to
utilize
a
state
employment
service
to
find
a
job
for
him.
the
last
one
would
be
to
put
him
on
the
public
works
job,
whether
that
would
be
out
in
the
farm
or
out
in
the
workhouse.
that's
the
last
the
last
one.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
think
that
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
there
is
no
work
at
all
these
days,
but
if
it
were
shown
--
evidence
did
show
that
it
was
impossible
to
place
him
anywhere,
we
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
require
him
to
work
at
a
designated
place
during
the
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
interest
of
the
society
do
not
justify
such
as
onerous
exaction,
such
an
imposition
upon
the
liberty
of
the
defendant.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
state
which
talks
in
terms
of
these
alternatives
really
administratively
feasible
for
a
stance
of
cost
is
that
administrative
convenience
is
not
a
sufficient
ground
for
such
an
onerous
exaction.
but
the
second
one
is
that
illinois,
by
passing
a
work
release
program
has
itself
recognized
that
these
alternatives
are
feasible.
of
course,
there's
one
glaring
defect
in
the
illinois
work
release
program
as
applied
to
the
person
who
is
incarcerated
for
nonpayment
of
fine.
that's
triple
punishment.
defendant
is
required
to
serve
his
year
in
jail,
pay
his
fine
with
the
earnings
he
gets
during
the
day
but
he
sits
in
jail
at
night.
and
there's
absolutely
no
justification
why
a
person
should
have
to
sit
in
jail
at
night
when
he
is
out
there
during
the
day
working
off
his
fine.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
it
applies
to
straight
jail
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
right,
let
me
explain
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
with
respect
to
a
person
who
is
doing
a
straight
jail
sentence,
he's
certainly
receiving
quite
a
benefit
to
be
told
that
he
can
obtain
some
liberty
during
the
day
and
he
can
hardly
complain
of
that.
but
the
person
who
is
being
incarcerated
for
nonpayment
of
fine,
the
only
interest
that
the
state
has
is
his
money.
when
they
let
him
go
out
during
the
day
to
get
that
money,
may
then
have
completely
undermined
that
by
saying
he
must
come
back
to
jail
at
night.
there
is
no
rational
justification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
williams?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he's
out.
he
was
bailed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
to
williams,
of
course,
the
work
release
program
was
passed
by
the
legislature
effective
january
1969
and
all
of
the
williams
proceedings
occurred
in
1967.
i
was
addressing
myself
to
in
the
event
that
it
were
applicable
to
him
or
other
persons
similarly
situated
what
the
effect
would
be,
and
my
point
was
that
the
work
release
statute
shows
that
the
administrative
convenience
argument
doesn't
hold
up.
and
secondly,
that
there's
a
glaring
defect
in
it
because
it
requires
night
time
incarceration
so
which
does
no
rational
justification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
adds
in
injury
by
making
a
$3.50
a
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
certainly
thought
that
the
language
of
the
statute
could
be
interpreted
literarily
and
would
be
granted
for
discharge.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
they've
construed
the
language
until
all
the
legal
means
have
been
exhausted
to
mean
that
the
defendant
either
must
show,
he's
physically
unable
to
work
which
is
the
goldstones
case
and
people
versus
hardenbergh.
or
that
no
work
is
provided
for
him.
now,
there's
always
housekeeping
available.
in
fact,
the
record
shows,
the
jail
record
of
williams
is
included
in
here
on
page
33
of
the
record.
and
it
does
show
that
when
he
was
serving
his
jail
time,
he
worked
in
the
laundry
and
he
worked
in
the
tailor
shop
and
he
worked
in
something
beginning
with
'k'
which
i
think
is
the
kitchen.
so
that,
all
people
that
are
in
jail
have
the
opportunity
to
work.
so
person
who
is
serving
off
or
working
off
a
fine
is
not
going
to
be
doing
anything
differently.
the
state
has
attempted
to
suggest
that
the
policy
of
deterrence
requires
the
result
reached
in
this
case.
we
dispute
that
contention
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
fact
the
illinois
is
going
under
180-6
to
discharge
a
persons
who
are
unable
to
work
or
for
whom
no
work
is
provided
is
an
indication
that
automatic
incarceration
of
everybody
who
don't
pay
fines,
not
necessary
to
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
we
submit
that
the
fine
is
certainly
a
different
order
of
punishment
than
a
jail
sentence.
if
the
trial
judge
wishes
to
individualize
the
sentence,
imposed
a
fine
because
he
feels
that
the
interest
of
society
require
no
more
than
a
fine.
it's
inconsistent
with
that
trial
judge's
determination
then
to
have
the
defendant
sitting
in
jail.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
really
a
blend
of
equal
protection
and
due
process,
almost
all
of
this
court's
criminal
procedure
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
frame
it
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
indigent
is
required
to
spend
more
jail
time
than
the
person
with
funds.
the
fact
the
indigent
defendant
despite
his
willingness
to
work
is
deprived
that
the
opportunity
to
payoff
the
fine
but
rather
remitted
to
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
there
is
more
to
it
than
that.
there
is
a
due
process
aspect
to
this
extent
that
the
state
seems
to
be
conclusively
presuming
that
incarceration
is
necessary
because
the
person
might
run
away
and
they
lose
the
risk,
so
to
speak,
and
he'll
run
away
from
the
job
and
he
won't
be
around
to
pay
the
fine.
that
type
conclusive
presumption
in
the
absence
any
showing,
any
hearing,
any
inquiry,
certainly
doesn't
comport
with
fundamental
principles.
so,
to
that
extent,
there
is
this
blend
of
due
process
into
the
equal
protection.
the
state's
attempt
to
justify
this
24-hour
day
incarceration
for
fear
that
some
people
might
skip
is
not
based
upon
any
evidence.
certainly,
not
in
this
record
and
i
take
it
the
state
this
arguing
in
a
broad
proposition
that
they're
entitled
to
incarcerate
somebody
around
the
clock
in
any
case
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
felon
may
come
in
and
say,
“well,
look,
i
have
great
possibility
of
getting
a
job.
i
could
earn
enough
funds
in
perhaps
a
week
or
two
to
pay
off
this
fine.”
but
--
and
the
state
says,
it
wants
the
revenue
from
collecting
these
fines,
and
yet
that
state
does
precisely
by
incarcerating
the
person
and
depriving
him
the
opportunity
to
go
out
to
work.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
clearly,
the
evaluation
is
a
legislative
matter.
however,
there
is
a
point
when
24-hour
incarceration
for
$5.00
a
day
is
so
obviously
unjust
compensation
as
to
render
it
on
constitution
because
we
have
to
remember
that
the
defendant
here
is
being
kept
for
longer
than
the
work
day.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
remission
to
incarceration
at
a
certain
value
is
the
last
resort.
it's
our
submission
in
this
case
that
the
state
should
have
done
something
before
they
resort
to
that
alternative.
and
the
state
didn't.
despite
the
fact
that
the
defendant
said
he
could
go
and
get
the
money
on
his
own,
the
state
wouldn't
have
to
keep
him
in
jail
and
to
work
off
the
fine
at
whatever
value
they
assigned.
he
said
that
he
could
go
out
and
get
that
money.
and
the
state
instead
of
even
inquiring
into
the
credibility
of
the
weights
of
those
contentions
which
the
state
did
not
meet
simply
denied
the
petition
without
evidentiary
hearing.
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
rather
than
adopt
the
type
of
construction
that
could
save
the
statute,
simply
said,
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
when
an
indigent
is
required
to
work
off
his
fine.
the
heart
of
this
thing
is
that
there
is
no
equivalent
between
the
rich
man's
choice
that
is
whether
anyone
is
to
pay
or
sit
in
jail
and
there
are
some
people
who
would
like
to
do
that.
and
the
exactions
on
the
indigent
requiring
him
to
sit
in
jail,
that
is
simply
an
inequality
and
that
is
(inaudible).
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
don't
think
i
will
use
that
up,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
traffic
courts
have
utilized
the
fines
as
a
method
of
keeping
the
system
supported.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
traffic
courts
are
going
to
change
their
practices
overnight.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
we're
entitled
to
trust
the
trial
judges'
discretion.
if
they
want
to
individualize
the
sentence,
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so.
if
they
think
that
a
fine
is
called
for
rather
than
imprisonment,
they
will
impose
a
fine.
if
they
feel
that
incarceration
is
called
for,
they
will
impose
incarceration.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
potential
is
there
but
i
think
we
have
to
test
the
courts.
i
think
the
potential
will
not
be
realized.
i
did
want
to
make
an
observation
with
respect
to
the
state's
complaint
that
they'll
have
difficulty
administering
these
evidentiary
hearings
going
to
the
financial
ability
of
the
defendant.
i'd
always
thought
that
was
a
basic
principle
of
american
law
that
it's
not
better
to
let
a
man
rot
in
jail
because
it
was
easier
for
the
state's
administrative
machinery
to
have
to
dispense
with
hearings.
but
besides,
the
lower
court
judges
right
now,
under
the
illinois
statutes
conduct
inquiries
into
the
defendant's
background,
etcetera
in
setting
bail.
there's
a
statute
right
now
that
requires
such
inquiries,
so
i
don't
understand
how
the
state
is
going
to
be
put
to
any
substantially
greater
hearings
that
it
engages
in
right
now.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
not
an
equivalent,
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
if
the
state
feels
that
he
cannot
pay,
they
still
must
do
something
less
than
putting
him
in
jail.
a
fine
is
not
the
equivalent
of
jail.
that
is
obvious
and
if
the
state
wants
to
get
the
revenue,
there
are
ways
of
collecting
it.
if
the
state
feels
that
a
fine
is
the
type
of
punishment,
that's
different
from
jail.
if
that's
appropriate,
then
that's
the
punishment
that
the
state
should
stick
to.
we're
not
telling
the
trial
judges
what
to
do.
we're
simply
talking
about
the
manner
in
which
the
state
gets
that
exaction.
if
the
judge
determines
money
is
the
sanction
that
should
be
the
sanction.
i
did
want
to
point
to
a
reference
in
terms
of
cost,
it
was
estimated
that
in
the
city
of
chicago
between
1907
and
1921,
when
prison
costs
were
relatively
low,
the
city
lost
$5
million
in
uncollected
fines
and
incurred
an
additional
expense
in
prison
maintenance
of
$5
million,
a
total
cost
of
$10
million.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
don't
have
those
figures.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
traffic
courts
have
been
granting
installments
on
some
occasions
but
i
don't
have
the
exact
figures.
but
in
terms
of
the
cost
problem,
the
economics
of
it
is
not
so
clear
at
all
that
the
state
will
be
bankrupted
by
a
ruling.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
to
the
extent
to
which
the
offense
is
punishable
by
fine
only,
we
would
be
dealing
with
the
situation
of
poor
people
being
subjected
to
a
sanction
different
from
the
sanction
as
to
rich
people.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
but
we
would
submit
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
would
submit
that
if
the
judge
determines
that
--
well,
first
of
all,
if
the
offense
is
serious
enough
to
warrant
incarceration
of
an
individual
would
seem
to
underlie
a
lot
of
these,
letting
an
indigence
to
get
away
with
violating
the
law
with
impunity.
this
legislature
has
the
ability
to
set
up
imprisonment
as
an
alternative
but
if
the
offense
is
not
serious
enough
to
require
an
exaction
greater
than
the
fine,
there's
not
justification
for
putting
people
in
jail
simply
because
they
don't
have
the
way
with
all
to
pay
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
possible
that
the
legislature
has
always
had
the
discretion
to
determine
what
penalties
are
appropriate
for
what
offenses
but
we're
talking
about
this
situation
is
an
automatic
system
that
puts
people
in
jail
without
any
inquiry
whatsoever
as
to
whether
or
not
the
money,
that
the
state
says
is
the
appropriate
sanction,
the
fine,
can
be
satisfied
in
the
means
less
onerous.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
legislature
has
not,
according
to
the
construction
put
on
the
statute
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
legislature
has
not
allowed
these
alternatives
to
work.
the
legislature
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
that's
what
they've
said.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
but
our
point
is
that
the
legislature
may
unconstitutionally
do
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
legislature
may
prescribe
maximum
penalties,
yes.
