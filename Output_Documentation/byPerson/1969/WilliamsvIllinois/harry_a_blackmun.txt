justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
bass,
what
would
you
think
of
an
overt
system
by
state
or
a
criminal
court
system
which
says
where
it's
determined
after
investigation
that
a
defendant
cannot
pay
a
fine,
we
just
won't
impose
a
fine
but
we
will
impose
an
alternative,
what
we
think
is
some
equivalent
jail
sentence.
