justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
substitute
for
the
fine?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
position
is
you
ought
to
--
all
you
want
probably
is
money
although
it
limits
your
remedy
to
that
as
long
you
think
you
can
get
it,
as
long
as
there
are
some
chance
of
getting
it.
now,
what
if
there
is
no
chance
of
getting
it,
is
there
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
won't
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
could
state
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
state,
in
order
to
satisfy
his
obligation,
he
would
always
purport
that
incarcerating
then
24
hours
a
day
would
have
to
offer
him
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
work
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
how
about
that
alternative,
are
they
obligated
to
use
that
one
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
permissible
yes.
but
the
state
says,
we
don't
want
him,
we
better
put
him
in
jail.
we
haven't
got
any
place
for
him
to
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
this
is
an
equal
protection
matter
or
a
due
process
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
define
your
equal
protection
position?
how
do
you
frame
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
consequence
of
the
economic
necessity
to
go
into
that
kind
of
a
–
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
states
have
got
a
statute,
where
the
illinois
statute
here,
or
as
construed,
the
illinois
statute
is
construed?
justice
byron
r.
white
48?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
do
different
work
after
the
one
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
keep
him
overnight?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
theory
isn't
some
substitute
kind
of
punishment,
but
you're
really
just
collecting
your
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
doesn't
work
for
night
and
day,
i
suppose,
why
don't
you
let
him
go
when
he
isn't
working?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
illinois,
in
taking
this
approach
currently
would
keep
a
person
as
long
as
necessary
to
work
off
the
fine
at
that
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
--
what's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
--
he
will
stay
--
he
can't
stay
in
jail
more
than
six
months
beyond
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
can
stay
in
jail
six
months
longer
than
the
maximum
term
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
imprisonment.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
charge
him
for
his
board
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he's
serving
his
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he's
serving
his
initial
year,
you
got
a
year
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
same
as
he
was
assigned
after
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
he
get
credit
on
his
fine
for
that
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
have
to
go
--
while
he's
serving
his
year,
assume
he
refused
to
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why?
what
good
reason
is
there
for
not
crediting
the
work
he
does
during
his
regular
prison
term
on
his
fine?
the
state
is
collecting
that
value
from
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
pay
people
for
working
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
illinois'
collected
fines
usually?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
system,
do
you
know
what
the
statute
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think,
the
intermediate
position
is
also
destructing
your
statement
which
i
gather
about
putting
a
man
who
can't
pay
his
fine
immediately,
putting
him
on
probation
(inaudible)
and
he
would
work
outside,
i
take
it
that
is
a
provision
in
illinois.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
that
work
offs
may
be
cheaper
and
more
efficient
way
of
control
but
what's
so
destructing
about
state
interest
when
a
felon
says,
“i
got
a
job,
i
can
get
a
job
and
i
will
work
to
pay
in
installments.
and
i'll
be
on
probation
which
is
more
than
every
week?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
are
talking
about
state
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is
a
viable
alternative
why
they'd
put
your
(inaudible)
about
compelling
state
interest
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
it
will
be
hard
to
contain
that
(inaudible).
justice
byron

white
so,
now
you
would
say
that
if
we
agree

we
agree
to
the
