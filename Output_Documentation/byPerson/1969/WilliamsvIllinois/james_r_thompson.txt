mr.
james
r.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1927,
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
last
resort
of
constitutional
arguments.
reading
the
opinions
of
this
court
will
show
that
we
have
come
quite
a
ways
since
that
characterization.
in
fact,
judge
skelly
wright
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
recently
referred
to
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
cutting
edge
of
our
expanding
constitutional
liberties.
one
of
the
issues
that's
involved
in
this
case
before
the
court
today
is
whether
that
cutting
edge
will
press
so
deeply
not
only
into
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
statutory
of
scheme
of
the
other
american
states
in
the
federal
government,
to
compel
those
states
and
the
federal
government
to
adopt
the
system
of
criminal
justice
administration.
greatly
different
from
that
which
they
have
adopted
by
the
legislative
process
in
the
name
of
the
explication
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
think
we
should
consider
at
the
outset
what
some
of
the
interests
are
in
considering
the
context
or
setting
of
the
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
it
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
allen
versus
illinois
just
some
weeks
ago,
the
constitutional
claims
must
be
considered
in
context.
and
we
think
the
context
of
the
equal
protection
claim
here
is
an
important
one.
first,
the
history
of
incarceration
to
work
off
a
fine
which
cannot
or
will
not
be
paid
is
an
ancient
one
far
outdating
the
american
legal
system.
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
kotch
versus
the
board
of
river
pilots
some
years
ago
and
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
harper
versus
the
virginia
board
of
elections,
the
history
of
a
practice
in
important
in
considering
whether
or
not
that
practice
violates
the
federal
constitution.
similarly,
the
widespread
usage
of
a
particular
feature
of
a
criminal
justice
system
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government
is
also
important
in
assessing
its
validity
under
the
federal
constitution
as
was
noted
for
the
court
in
the
opinion
in
roth
versus
the
united
states
for
the
fact
that
not
only
in
all
american
jurisdictions
and
the
federal
government
ban
the
dissemination
of
obscenity
but
most
of
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
did
as
well,
we
think
it's
equally
relevant
then
to
consider
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
equal
protection
has
been
violated
here,
that
all
of
the
states
of
the
federal
union
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
the
english
government
before
that
have
allowed
the
incarceration
of
those
who
cannot
or
will
not
pay
their
fines
until
the
fines
has
worked
off.
the
impact
of
this
court's
holding
that
the
illinois
system
is
unconstitutional
must
also
be
considered,
we
believe,
for
this
court
to
decide
how
far
they
will
take
the
equal
protection
clause
because
if
the
challenge
to
illinois
statute
is
successful
in
this
court
today,
similar
challenges
will
follow.
challenge
to
the
bail
system,
the
claim
that
the
requirement
of
a
monetary
bail
in
any
case
is
irrational.
if
other
factors
will
show
or
seek
to
persuade
that
the
defendant
will
not
flee.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
at
least
48,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
at
least
48.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
new
york
has
a
statute
where
there
is
to
be
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
indigent
can
pay
the
fine
and
if
he
cannot
pay
the
fine,
they
go
back
and
re-sentence
and
they
don't
follow
exactly
the
same
procedures
in
illinois
and
i'm
informed
by
counsel
in
the
case
that
you
are
to
here
following
this
one
that
maryland
has
recently
changed
its
statute
in
light
of
the
opinion
below
in
the
schoonfield
case.
but
to
my
knowledge,
all
the
rest
of
the
states
of
the
american
jurisdiction
have
statutes
similar
to
illinois
so
as
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
illinois'
policy
is
more
benign
in
this
regard
because
illinois
does
allow
discharge
where
no
work
is
available
or
where
his
physically
unable
to
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
right.
that
follows,
i
think,
our
policy
of
regarding
the
incarceration
for
failure
to
pay
this
fine
as
the
equivalent
of
the
collection
of
money
by
collecting
in
labor
and
obviously
if
we
can't
collect
in
labor,
the
man
has
no
business
in
jail.
but
some
other
states
justify
incarceration
in
lieu
of
payment
of
fine
on
an
alternative
punishment
theory
and
since
they
don't
depend
upon
the
collection
of
revenue
theory,
it's
easy
to
see
why
they
don't
discharge
for
failure
to
provide
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
could
not.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
to
draw.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
a
judge
could
say
that,
your
honor.
the
record
does
not
reflect
judge
giles
said
in
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct,
he
could
not
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
he
could
not
give
him
an
additional
101
days
as
punishment
neither
could
he
give
the
indigent
man
an
additional
101
days
as
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
could
simply
impose
a
fine
which
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
which
he
knew
he
couldn't
pay.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir.
we
do
not
equate
that
101
days
it
takes
to
work
off
the
fine
to
give
the
state
your
labor
for
101
days
as
the
equivalent
of
101
days
of
straight
punishment
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
difference
being
that
in
one
case,
he
is
in
there
to
give
the
state
the
value
of
his
services.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
why
the
state
has
in
there,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
the
man,
obviously
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
necessarily.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
suppose
one
reason
we
keep
them
overnight
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
i
have
nothing
the
record
to
support
this
but
i
don't
think
that
the
value
of
work
off
system
insofar
as
it
applies
to
a
jail
system,
considering
the
people
who
are
convicted
and
have
no
money
to
pay
their
fines
who
would
stand
very
long
if
they
were
permitted
to
be
released
at
night.
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
percentages
of
failures
to
return
to
the
jail
during
the
day.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
illinois
has
a
maximum
limitation
of
six
months
no
matter
what
the
fine
is.
it
cannot
serve
longer
than
six
months
in
the
working
off
with
the
fine.
illinois
is
one
of
the
few
states
to
have
such
a
maximum
period.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
no
he
can
--
if
he
is
given
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense,
he
would
stay
in
jail
beyond
that
maximum
term
only
for
so
long
as
it
takes
to
workout
the
fine
for
$85.00
a
day
or
six
months,
whichever
is
greater,
whichever
is
less.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct,
that
right.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant,
an
attempt
is
made
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
back
in
the
early
1900s,
the
rate
was
$1.50
a
day.
i'm
not
sure
precisely
how
far
back
it
goes
but
i
think
it's
relevantly
recent,
$5.00
a
day
provision.
and
it's
among
the
highest
in
the
country
in
terms
of
work
off
statutes.
i
think
only
a
very
few
states
have
a
higher
rate,
$8.00
or
something
like
that
i
think
being
the
maximum.
most
of
them
averaging
around
$5.00
or
in
some
cases
even
less.
ohio
recently
declared
unconstitutional
the
$2.00
a
day,
i
believe.
but
they
vary.
but
illinois
is
fairly
high
up
in
the
list.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
under
the
work
off
system
as
such,
i
think
it's
probably
reflected
in
the
value
of
his
labor,
in
other
words,
we're
not
saying
your
labor
is
only
worth
$5.00
a
day
to
as
we're
probably
really
saying
to
him
that
your
labor
is
worth
at
least
$11.00
a
day
to
us
because
it
costs
about
$6.13
to
keep
him.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
his
record
in
the
appendix
reflects
that
he
was
assigned
to
the
tailor
shop
or
the
kitchen
so
i
presume
he
worked.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
presume
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
suppose
on
the
theory
that
it's
a
sort
of
consecutive
sentence
idea.
i
mean
if
he
were
convicted
say
of
two
crimes,
defendant
under
illinois
law
could
be
sentenced
consecutively.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
during
the
first
year?
well,
i
assume
he
might
be
put
into
the
disciplinary
cell
or
subject
to
discipline
of
some
kind
or
loses
good
time,
probably,
most
likely
a
remedy
that
will
be
employed.
if
he
refused
to
work,
if
he
refused
in
his
lawful
assignment
in
the
prison
system,
i
assume
he
would
lose
his
good
time.
that
would
be
an
incentive
for
him
to
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
it
is.
i
assume
though
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
put
its
regularly
sentenced
prisoners
to
work
even
though
no
fine
has
been
imposed
and
as
an
incidental
benefit
to
the
state,
flowing
from
the
year's
imprisonment,
they're
entitled
to
collect
that
labor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
there
are
some
projects
in
the
city
jail
which
prisoners
may
obtain
a
small
amount
of
paid
form
even
though
they're
not
working
out
fine.
although
sometimes
the
pay
is
in
the
form
of
privileges
or
tobacco
or
things
of
that
sort
but
it's
really
not
a
reimbursement
scheme
and
such.
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that
if
the
man
was
sentenced
simply
for
a
year
in
jail,
the
state
is
entitled
to
exact
that
year
in
terms
of
his
time
in
the
normal
theory
of
a
jail
punishment
and
they're
also
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
his
labor,
i
think
during
that
period.
but
the
sentence
in
this
case
was
a
year
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
$500.00,
a
sentence
permissible
under
illinois
law,
sentence
which
is
not
challenged
in
this
court
on
grounds
of
constitutionality
or
rationality.
the
state
is
therefore
saying
to
willie
williams,
we
are
entitled
to
keep
you
in
jail
for
a
year
to
derive
whatever
incidental
benefits
flow
to
the
state
from
that
year
of
service
in
jail
and
we
are
also
entitled
to
collect
from
you
a
$500.00
fine
or
its
equivalent
in
labor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
irrational
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
say
that
in
so
far
as
the
collection
of
the
benefits
from
the
labor
are
concerned,
they
must
be
served
separately.
in
other
words,
that
the
fine
work
off
must
follow
the
year's
work
off
and
that
he
need
not,
under
a
rational
scheme
of
prison
administration,
be
given
credit
for
the
fine
work
off
during
the
course
of
the
first
year.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
a
man
who
was
an
indigent
must
work
off
his
fine
in
the
same
jail
that
men
go
to
who
are
sentenced.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
a
millionaire,
who
pays
his
fine,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
true.
the
question,
that
that
raises,
is
does
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
and
that
was
the
question
that
was
raised
in
the
brief
and
that
is
a
question
which
this
court
has
never
really
considered.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
for
my
remaining
moments
of
argument
to
an
examination
of
how
this
court's
previous
cases,
setting
forth
what
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
are
that
touch
this
case.
obviously,
the
traditional
test
that
this
court
has
talked
about
in
equal
protection
cases
is
what
class
has
the
state
set
up?
in
this
case,
those
who
do
not,
for
whatever
reason
pay
their
fine.
what
scheme
has
the
state
adopted
to
deal
with
that
class?
in
this
case,
the
work
off
system.
what
interests
of
the
state
does
that
scheme
serve?
in
this
case,
transit
crime
by
preserving
the
value
of
fines
and
the
courts
which
impose
fines
as
a
component
of
our
criminal
justice
system
and
the
collection
of
revenue
which
fines
bring
in.
the
final
question
under
the
traditional
test,
does
the
state's
scheme
rationally
relate
to
the
end
result
which
they
seek
to
achieve?
and
in
this
case,
we
say
it
does
because
the
work
off
system
of
illinois
offers
the
opportunity
for
the
state
to
keep
its
fine
system
viable
and
at
the
same
time
to
collect
the
equivalent
of
fine
and
the
labor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
certain
your
honor
but
it's
certainly
in
the
high
millions
of
dollars
when
you
count
in
the
fines
collected
by
the
courts
which
handle
cases
in
which
the
fine
is
the
only
punishment,
including
traffic
offenses.
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
high
millions
and
as
a
practical
matter,
offers
the
source
of
support
for
those
courts
which
enforce
misdemeanor
and
petty
offenses
and
traffic
offenses
without
the
revenues
derived
from
the
imposition
of
fines.
especially
in
traffic
cases,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
state
of
illinois
under
its
present
budget
to
support
those
courts.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
adds
and
flows
--
i
was
out
to
the
bridewell
jail
just
a
few
weeks
ago
and
they
are
not
overcrowded
in
the
bridewell.
it
depends
on
a
number
of
factors,
sometimes
they
are
overcrowded,
sometimes
there
is
space
available.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
but
crime
doesn't
follow
a
steady
pace.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
think
the
state
of
illinois
would
be
entitled
to
impose
a
tax,
a
revenue
collecting
tax
on
all
of
its
citizens
and
to
provide
some
means
for
alternative
collection
if
the
man
failed
to
pay
it.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
we
could
extract
the
value
of
his
labor
and
services
to
the
state
and
if
necessary,
to
accomplish
that
objective
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
would
draw
a
distinction,
your
honor
between
your
hypothetical
in
my
case
for
this
reason.
we're
not
dealing
in
the
williams
case
with
an
ordinary
citizen
who
has
been
taxed
and
who
has
failed
to
pay.
we're
dealing
with
a
man
who
has
committed
a
criminal
offense,
has
had
a
trial
which
was
presumably
fair,
has
been
found
guilty
and
has
been
sentenced
to
a
criminal
fine.
now,
i
think
the
state
is
entitled
to
draw
different
assumptions
with
regard
to
willie
williams
and
what
is
necessary
to
extract
the
value
of
his
services
than
it
is
with
a
taxpayer.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
the
difference
is
simply
i
think
that
the
state
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
think
on
the
broad
scheme
--
on
the
broad
scale,
you
could
certainly
say
that
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
sure
he
presumed
that
willie
williams
is
not
going
to
come
up
with
$500.00
in
cash,
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessarily
a
motive
which
you
can
ascribe
to
the
judge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
i
think
he
was
saying
that
the
circumstances
of
williams'
crime,
whatever
they
were,
and
the
record
does
not
show
it,
warranted
the
maximum
penalty
provided
for
by
law.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct
and
then
so
far
as
the
fine
is
concerned,
the
maximum
fine.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
is
the
net
result
of
the
sentence,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
the
extraordinary
effect
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
not
only
in
illinois
but
in
all
the
states.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
several
areas,
first,
a
holding
of
that
time
would
necessarily
take
this
court
far
beyond
the
rationale
of
griffin
versus
illinois
which
provided
for
the
first
time
that
the
state
must
attempt
to
remedy
the
imbalance
between
the
poor
and
the
rich,
so
far
as
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
concerned.
but
the
impact
to
that
opinion
so
far
has
always
been
confined
by
this
court
to
those
stages
of
the
criminal
justice
process
which
determined
guilt
or
provide
for
a
first
appellate
review
of
guilt.
this
court
has
been
very,
very
hesitant,
in
fact
has
not
at
all
taken
the
rationale
of
griffin
beyond
those
narrow
bounds.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
alright.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
this
is
what
it
would
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
to
those
cases
where
the
only
penalty
provided
by
law
was
a
fine
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
which
could
be
changed
except
that
that
would
have
an
extremely
harsh
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
because
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
in
the
traffic
area,
for
example,
a
state
would
be
low
to
provide
that
the
only
possible
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
in
a
traffic
case
was
a
jail
sentence.
i
think
we
would
have
chaos
in
traffic
law
enforcement.
and
i
think
the
same
would
be
true
in
a
number
of
petty
offenses
and
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
right.
the
second
thing
that
it
would
do
is
that
it
would
encourage
spurious
claims
of
indigency
and
that
it
would
impose
on
the
court's
least
able
to
handle
it,
a
burden
of
determining
something
new
in
a
case,
not
only
must
they
first
determine
guilt,
but
after
determination
of
guilt,
if
there
was
a
claim
on
indigency
and
that
a
fine
could
not
be
paid,
they
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
man
was
in
fact
indigent.
now,
it's
one
thing
to
require
a
hearing
of
that
sort
in
a
criminal
court
where
the
issues
is
does
he
have
the
money
for
a
transcript
on
appeal
or
a
lawyer
on
appeal
where
the
judge
may
have
on
his
call
one
or
two
or
three
or
five
cases
a
day.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
say
for
example
to
the
municipal
court
of
chicago,
in
a
traffic
case
where
a
judge
may
have
two
or
three
or
400
cases
on
his
call
per
day
that
whenever
he
is
confronted
with
the
claim
of
indigency,
he
must
stop
and
determine
that
fact
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
going
to
have
to
work
off
his
fine
under
the
illinois
work
off
system.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
so
sure
that's
true,
your
honor
because
first,
suppose
the
fine
was
substantially
greater
than
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
i
don't,
no
i
don't.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
i
do,
it
does
actually
happen
but
the
percentage
figures
i
don't
have.
i
think
it
happens
fairly
often,
i
think
it
happens
fairly
often.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
if
i
accept
it
your
honors.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
if
i
accepted
your
premise,
i
would
agree
with
you.
i
cannot,
under
the
terms
of
my
argument,
accept
the
premise
that
it
imposes
initial
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
fact,
he
goes
to
the
same
jail
as
a
man
who
is
sentenced
to
a
straight
jail
term,
that's
correct.
and
in
fact
as
a
man
pays
his
fine,
he
does
go
to
jail.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
and
who
pays
the
fine,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
just
what
happens.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
because
under
this
traditional
equal
protection
test
which
this
court
has
set
up,
if
we
shown
irrational
class,
those
who
do
not
pay,
rational
state
objectives
to
be
achieved
in
a
rational
connection
between
the
two
of
the
work
off
system.
it
doesn't
violate
equal
protection
even
though
it
may
treat
some
people
differently
than
others.
but
even
if
we
move
beyond
that
traditional
test,
as
this
court
has
moved
in
some
areas.
for
example,
in
the
shapiro
case,
testing
whether
or
not
a
one
year's
residency
require
it
for
welfare,
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
where
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
in
cases
involving
the
exercise
of
constitutional
right,
you
have
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest,
not
merely
a
rational
relationship
or
some
other
cases
which
have
essentially
used
a
balancing
approach
to
the
advantages
gained
by
the
state,
outweigh
the
disadvantages
to
the
defendant.
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
rest
of
the
states
of
the
union,
in
preserving
the
idea
that
this
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
this
and
allied
practices
such
as
the
area
of
bail,
is
so
strong
that
it
outweighs
the
disadvantage
to
the
indigent
defendant
even
if
the
test
is
compelling
state
interest
or
the
balancing
of
advantages
to
one
side.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
indigency
excused
a
man
from
incarceration
under
the
work
off
system,
that
the
threat
to
other
state
interests,
including
the
maintenance
of
the
whole
fine
system,
the
maintenance
of
the
courts
which
enforce
the
fine
system,
especially
in
those
cases
where
the
fine
is
the
only
penalty
and
the
maintenance,
the
monetary
bail
system
and
the
potential
saddling
of
all
those
courts
with
spurious
claims
of
indigency
which
do
not
now
arise
because
a
man
knows
if
he
doesn't
pay
his
fine,
he's
going
to
jail
to
work
it
off,
are
so
compelling
that
they
outweigh
whatever
disadvantages
there
are
in
sending
an
indigent
man
to
jail
to
work
off
his
fine.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
we
probably
would.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
man
goes
to
jail
for
no
more
than
30
days
in
lieu
with
paying
off
the
fine.
the
federal
government
has
it
too.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
under
the
federal
statute?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
illinois
there
is
no
such,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
we
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
there
are
two
considerations,
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
if
we're
going
to
consider
the
question
of
alternatives
to
the
work
off
system
which
are
thought
to
be
less
onerous
to
the
indigent
defendant
than
the
work
off
system.
the
first
question
which
arises
is,
is
it
within
the
province
of
this
court
to
examine
whether
there
are
viable
alternatives?
or
must
this
court,
in
an
equal
protection
case
refrain
from
deciding
what
is
a
wiser,
what
is
a
more
humane,
what
is
a
more
just
system
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i'm
not
sure.
if
we
were
--
if
we
were
following
the
traditional
test
of
equal
protection
cases,
we
would
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
there
were
in
fact
alternatives.
but
if
we
are
following
what's
been
called
the
balancing
test
or
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
i'm
not
sure
even
there
that
the
same
rule
doesn't
carry
over.
in
other
words,
if
this
court
can
find
a
compelling
state
interest
which
is
carried
out
by
a
rational
scheme
which
the
state
has
selected,
we
think
the
work
off
system,
standing
by
itself
is
a
rational
scheme.
then
i'm
not
so
sure
that
even
in
a
compelling
interest
case,
if
this
is
one.
that
this
court
can
say,
but
we
will
strike
down
the
rational
scheme
because
there
are
other
rational
schemes
which
contain
less
disadvantage
to
the
defendant.
as
this
court
said
just
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
dandridge
case
talking
about
the
maximum
grants
on
welfare
payments.
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
reiterating
again
words
which
have
been
used
for
years
in
equal
protection
cases.
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
other
policies
which
are
available
at
the
state
of
illinois
but
the
question
is,
can
this
court,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
make
the
state
used.
in
illinois,
as
this
court
sits
today,
we
have
a
legislature
sitting
and
we
have
a
constitutional
convention
sitting.
and
i
think
the
arguments
of
mr.
bass
has
made
to
this
court
today
are
more
properly
directed
to
those
two
bodies.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that's
entirely
clear.
i
think
one
of
the
results
of
such
a
holding
would
be
that
some
judges
would
simply
impose
maximum
jail
sentences
where
they
do
not
now
impose
jail
sentences.
i
couldn't
say
that
all
judges
would
do
that.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
it
would
not
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
this
case,
he
could
not
give
anymore,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
the
danger
of
that
as
a
consequence
to
the
holding
is
great
danger
as
to
the
consequence
to
this
holding
for
the
bail
system,
for
the
whole
system
of
fines
in
the
courts
which
force
that
question.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1927,
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
last
resort
of
constitutional
arguments.
reading
the
opinions
of
this
court
will
show
that
we
have
come
quite
a
ways
since
that
characterization.
in
fact,
judge
skelly
wright
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
recently
referred
to
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
cutting
edge
of
our
expanding
constitutional
liberties.
one
of
the
issues
that's
involved
in
this
case
before
the
court
today
is
whether
that
cutting
edge
will
press
so
deeply
not
only
into
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
statutory
of
scheme
of
the
other
american
states
in
the
federal
government,
to
compel
those
states
and
the
federal
government
to
adopt
the
system
of
criminal
justice
administration.
greatly
different
from
that
which
they
have
adopted
by
the
legislative
process
in
the
name
of
the
explication
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
think
we
should
consider
at
the
outset
what
some
of
the
interests
are
in
considering
the
context
or
setting
of
the
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
it
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
allen
versus
illinois
just
some
weeks
ago,
the
constitutional
claims
must
be
considered
in
context.
and
we
think
the
context
of
the
equal
protection
claim
here
is
an
important
one.
first,
the
history
of
incarceration
to
work
off
a
fine
which
cannot
or
will
not
be
paid
is
an
ancient
one
far
outdating
the
american
legal
system.
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
kotch
versus
the
board
of
river
pilots
some
years
ago
and
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
harper
versus
the
virginia
board
of
elections,
the
history
of
a
practice
in
important
in
considering
whether
or
not
that
practice
violates
the
federal
constitution.
similarly,
the
widespread
usage
of
a
particular
feature
of
a
criminal
justice
system
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government
is
also
important
in
assessing
its
validity
under
the
federal
constitution
as
was
noted
for
the
court
in
the
opinion
in
roth
versus
the
united
states
for
the
fact
that
not
only
in
all
american
jurisdictions
and
the
federal
government
ban
the
dissemination
of
obscenity
but
most
of
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
did
as
well,
we
think
it's
equally
relevant
then
to
consider
in
the
context
of
whether
or
not
equal
protection
has
been
violated
here,
that
all
of
the
states
of
the
federal
union
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
the
english
government
before
that
have
allowed
the
incarceration
of
those
who
cannot
or
will
not
pay
their
fines
until
the
fines
has
worked
off.
the
impact
of
this
court's
holding
that
the
illinois
system
is
unconstitutional
must
also
be
considered,
we
believe,
for
this
court
to
decide
how
far
they
will
take
the
equal
protection
clause
because
if
the
challenge
to
illinois
statute
is
successful
in
this
court
today,
similar
challenges
will
follow.
challenge
to
the
bail
system,
the
claim
that
the
requirement
of
a
monetary
bail
in
any
case
is
irrational.
if
other
factors
will
show
or
seek
to
persuade
that
the
defendant
will
not
flee.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
at
least
48,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
at
least
48.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
new
york
has
a
statute
where
there
is
to
be
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
indigent
can
pay
the
fine
and
if
he
cannot
pay
the
fine,
they
go
back
and
re-sentence
and
they
don't
follow
exactly
the
same
procedures
in
illinois
and
i'm
informed
by
counsel
in
the
case
that
you
are
to
here
following
this
one
that
maryland
has
recently
changed
its
statute
in
light
of
the
opinion
below
in
the
schoonfield
case.
but
to
my
knowledge,
all
the
rest
of
the
states
of
the
american
jurisdiction
have
statutes
similar
to
illinois
so
as
the
federal
government.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
illinois'
policy
is
more
benign
in
this
regard
because
illinois
does
allow
discharge
where
no
work
is
available
or
where
his
physically
unable
to
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
right.
that
follows,
i
think,
our
policy
of
regarding
the
incarceration
for
failure
to
pay
this
fine
as
the
equivalent
of
the
collection
of
money
by
collecting
in
labor
and
obviously
if
we
can't
collect
in
labor,
the
man
has
no
business
in
jail.
but
some
other
states
justify
incarceration
in
lieu
of
payment
of
fine
on
an
alternative
punishment
theory
and
since
they
don't
depend
upon
the
collection
of
revenue
theory,
it's
easy
to
see
why
they
don't
discharge
for
failure
to
provide
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
could
not.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
to
draw.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
a
judge
could
say
that,
your
honor.
the
record
does
not
reflect
judge
giles
said
in
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct,
he
could
not
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
he
could
not
give
him
an
additional
101
days
as
punishment
neither
could
he
give
the
indigent
man
an
additional
101
days
as
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
could
simply
impose
a
fine
which
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
which
he
knew
he
couldn't
pay.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir.
we
do
not
equate
that
101
days
it
takes
to
work
off
the
fine
to
give
the
state
your
labor
for
101
days
as
the
equivalent
of
101
days
of
straight
punishment
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
difference
being
that
in
one
case,
he
is
in
there
to
give
the
state
the
value
of
his
services.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
why
the
state
has
in
there,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
the
man,
obviously
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
necessarily.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
suppose
one
reason
we
keep
them
overnight
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
i
have
nothing
the
record
to
support
this
but
i
don't
think
that
the
value
of
work
off
system
insofar
as
it
applies
to
a
jail
system,
considering
the
people
who
are
convicted
and
have
no
money
to
pay
their
fines
who
would
stand
very
long
if
they
were
permitted
to
be
released
at
night.
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
percentages
of
failures
to
return
to
the
jail
during
the
day.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
illinois
has
a
maximum
limitation
of
six
months
no
matter
what
the
fine
is.
it
cannot
serve
longer
than
six
months
in
the
working
off
with
the
fine.
illinois
is
one
of
the
few
states
to
have
such
a
maximum
period.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
no
he
can
--
if
he
is
given
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense,
he
would
stay
in
jail
beyond
that
maximum
term
only
for
so
long
as
it
takes
to
workout
the
fine
for
$85.00
a
day
or
six
months,
whichever
is
greater,
whichever
is
less.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct,
that
right.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant,
an
attempt
is
made
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
back
in
the
early
1900s,
the
rate
was
$1.50
a
day.
i'm
not
sure
precisely
how
far
back
it
goes
but
i
think
it's
relevantly
recent,
$5.00
a
day
provision.
and
it's
among
the
highest
in
the
country
in
terms
of
work
off
statutes.
i
think
only
a
very
few
states
have
a
higher
rate,
$8.00
or
something
like
that
i
think
being
the
maximum.
most
of
them
averaging
around
$5.00
or
in
some
cases
even
less.
ohio
recently
declared
unconstitutional
the
$2.00
a
day,
i
believe.
but
they
vary.
but
illinois
is
fairly
high
up
in
the
list.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
under
the
work
off
system
as
such,
i
think
it's
probably
reflected
in
the
value
of
his
labor,
in
other
words,
we're
not
saying
your
labor
is
only
worth
$5.00
a
day
to
as
we're
probably
really
saying
to
him
that
your
labor
is
worth
at
least
$11.00
a
day
to
us
because
it
costs
about
$6.13
to
keep
him.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
his
record
in
the
appendix
reflects
that
he
was
assigned
to
the
tailor
shop
or
the
kitchen
so
i
presume
he
worked.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
presume
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
suppose
on
the
theory
that
it's
a
sort
of
consecutive
sentence
idea.
i
mean
if
he
were
convicted
say
of
two
crimes,
defendant
under
illinois
law
could
be
sentenced
consecutively.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
during
the
first
year?
well,
i
assume
he
might
be
put
into
the
disciplinary
cell
or
subject
to
discipline
of
some
kind
or
loses
good
time,
probably,
most
likely
a
remedy
that
will
be
employed.
if
he
refused
to
work,
if
he
refused
in
his
lawful
assignment
in
the
prison
system,
i
assume
he
would
lose
his
good
time.
that
would
be
an
incentive
for
him
to
work.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
it
is.
i
assume
though
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
put
its
regularly
sentenced
prisoners
to
work
even
though
no
fine
has
been
imposed
and
as
an
incidental
benefit
to
the
state,
flowing
from
the
year's
imprisonment,
they're
entitled
to
collect
that
labor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
there
are
some
projects
in
the
city
jail
which
prisoners
may
obtain
a
small
amount
of
paid
form
even
though
they're
not
working
out
fine.
although
sometimes
the
pay
is
in
the
form
of
privileges
or
tobacco
or
things
of
that
sort
but
it's
really
not
a
reimbursement
scheme
and
such.
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that
if
the
man
was
sentenced
simply
for
a
year
in
jail,
the
state
is
entitled
to
exact
that
year
in
terms
of
his
time
in
the
normal
theory
of
a
jail
punishment
and
they're
also
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
his
labor,
i
think
during
that
period.
but
the
sentence
in
this
case
was
a
year
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
$500.00,
a
sentence
permissible
under
illinois
law,
sentence
which
is
not
challenged
in
this
court
on
grounds
of
constitutionality
or
rationality.
the
state
is
therefore
saying
to
willie
williams,
we
are
entitled
to
keep
you
in
jail
for
a
year
to
derive
whatever
incidental
benefits
flow
to
the
state
from
that
year
of
service
in
jail
and
we
are
also
entitled
to
collect
from
you
a
$500.00
fine
or
its
equivalent
in
labor.
and
i
don't
think
it's
irrational
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
say
that
in
so
far
as
the
collection
of
the
benefits
from
the
labor
are
concerned,
they
must
be
served
separately.
in
other
words,
that
the
fine
work
off
must
follow
the
year's
work
off
and
that
he
need
not,
under
a
rational
scheme
of
prison
administration,
be
given
credit
for
the
fine
work
off
during
the
course
of
the
first
year.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
a
man
who
was
an
indigent
must
work
off
his
fine
in
the
same
jail
that
men
go
to
who
are
sentenced.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
a
millionaire,
who
pays
his
fine,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
true.
the
question,
that
that
raises,
is
does
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
and
that
was
the
question
that
was
raised
in
the
brief
and
that
is
a
question
which
this
court
has
never
really
considered.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
for
my
remaining
moments
of
argument
to
an
examination
of
how
this
court's
previous
cases,
setting
forth
what
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
are
that
touch
this
case.
obviously,
the
traditional
test
that
this
court
has
talked
about
in
equal
protection
cases
is
what
class
has
the
state
set
up?
in
this
case,
those
who
do
not,
for
whatever
reason
pay
their
fine.
what
scheme
has
the
state
adopted
to
deal
with
that
class?
in
this
case,
the
work
off
system.
what
interests
of
the
state
does
that
scheme
serve?
in
this
case,
transit
crime
by
preserving
the
value
of
fines
and
the
courts
which
impose
fines
as
a
component
of
our
criminal
justice
system
and
the
collection
of
revenue
which
fines
bring
in.
the
final
question
under
the
traditional
test,
does
the
state's
scheme
rationally
relate
to
the
end
result
which
they
seek
to
achieve?
and
in
this
case,
we
say
it
does
because
the
work
off
system
of
illinois
offers
the
opportunity
for
the
state
to
keep
its
fine
system
viable
and
at
the
same
time
to
collect
the
equivalent
of
fine
and
the
labor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
certain
your
honor
but
it's
certainly
in
the
high
millions
of
dollars
when
you
count
in
the
fines
collected
by
the
courts
which
handle
cases
in
which
the
fine
is
the
only
punishment,
including
traffic
offenses.
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
high
millions
and
as
a
practical
matter,
offers
the
source
of
support
for
those
courts
which
enforce
misdemeanor
and
petty
offenses
and
traffic
offenses
without
the
revenues
derived
from
the
imposition
of
fines.
especially
in
traffic
cases,
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
state
of
illinois
under
its
present
budget
to
support
those
courts.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
adds
and
flows
--
i
was
out
to
the
bridewell
jail
just
a
few
weeks
ago
and
they
are
not
overcrowded
in
the
bridewell.
it
depends
on
a
number
of
factors,
sometimes
they
are
overcrowded,
sometimes
there
is
space
available.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
but
crime
doesn't
follow
a
steady
pace.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
think
the
state
of
illinois
would
be
entitled
to
impose
a
tax,
a
revenue
collecting
tax
on
all
of
its
citizens
and
to
provide
some
means
for
alternative
collection
if
the
man
failed
to
pay
it.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
we
could
extract
the
value
of
his
labor
and
services
to
the
state
and
if
necessary,
to
accomplish
that
objective
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
would
draw
a
distinction,
your
honor
between
your
hypothetical
in
my
case
for
this
reason.
we're
not
dealing
in
the
williams
case
with
an
ordinary
citizen
who
has
been
taxed
and
who
has
failed
to
pay.
we're
dealing
with
a
man
who
has
committed
a
criminal
offense,
has
had
a
trial
which
was
presumably
fair,
has
been
found
guilty
and
has
been
sentenced
to
a
criminal
fine.
now,
i
think
the
state
is
entitled
to
draw
different
assumptions
with
regard
to
willie
williams
and
what
is
necessary
to
extract
the
value
of
his
services
than
it
is
with
a
taxpayer.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
the
difference
is
simply
i
think
that
the
state
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
think
on
the
broad
scheme
--
on
the
broad
scale,
you
could
certainly
say
that
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
sure
he
presumed
that
willie
williams
is
not
going
to
come
up
with
$500.00
in
cash,
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessarily
a
motive
which
you
can
ascribe
to
the
judge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
i
think
he
was
saying
that
the
circumstances
of
williams'
crime,
whatever
they
were,
and
the
record
does
not
show
it,
warranted
the
maximum
penalty
provided
for
by
law.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct
and
then
so
far
as
the
fine
is
concerned,
the
maximum
fine.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
is
the
net
result
of
the
sentence,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
the
extraordinary
effect
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
not
only
in
illinois
but
in
all
the
states.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
several
areas,
first,
a
holding
of
that
time
would
necessarily
take
this
court
far
beyond
the
rationale
of
griffin
versus
illinois
which
provided
for
the
first
time
that
the
state
must
attempt
to
remedy
the
imbalance
between
the
poor
and
the
rich,
so
far
as
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
is
concerned.
but
the
impact
to
that
opinion
so
far
has
always
been
confined
by
this
court
to
those
stages
of
the
criminal
justice
process
which
determined
guilt
or
provide
for
a
first
appellate
review
of
guilt.
this
court
has
been
very,
very
hesitant,
in
fact
has
not
at
all
taken
the
rationale
of
griffin
beyond
those
narrow
bounds.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
alright.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
this
is
what
it
would
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
to
those
cases
where
the
only
penalty
provided
by
law
was
a
fine
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
which
could
be
changed
except
that
that
would
have
an
extremely
harsh
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
because
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
in
the
traffic
area,
for
example,
a
state
would
be
low
to
provide
that
the
only
possible
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
in
a
traffic
case
was
a
jail
sentence.
i
think
we
would
have
chaos
in
traffic
law
enforcement.
and
i
think
the
same
would
be
true
in
a
number
of
petty
offenses
and
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
right.
the
second
thing
that
it
would
do
is
that
it
would
encourage
spurious
claims
of
indigency
and
that
it
would
impose
on
the
court's
least
able
to
handle
it,
a
burden
of
determining
something
new
in
a
case,
not
only
must
they
first
determine
guilt,
but
after
determination
of
guilt,
if
there
was
a
claim
on
indigency
and
that
a
fine
could
not
be
paid,
they
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
man
was
in
fact
indigent.
now,
it's
one
thing
to
require
a
hearing
of
that
sort
in
a
criminal
court
where
the
issues
is
does
he
have
the
money
for
a
transcript
on
appeal
or
a
lawyer
on
appeal
where
the
judge
may
have
on
his
call
one
or
two
or
three
or
five
cases
a
day.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
say
for
example
to
the
municipal
court
of
chicago,
in
a
traffic
case
where
a
judge
may
have
two
or
three
or
400
cases
on
his
call
per
day
that
whenever
he
is
confronted
with
the
claim
of
indigency,
he
must
stop
and
determine
that
fact
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
going
to
have
to
work
off
his
fine
under
the
illinois
work
off
system.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
so
sure
that's
true,
your
honor
because
first,
suppose
the
fine
was
substantially
greater
than
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
i
don't,
no
i
don't.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
i
do,
it
does
actually
happen
but
the
percentage
figures
i
don't
have.
i
think
it
happens
fairly
often,
i
think
it
happens
fairly
often.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
if
i
accept
it
your
honors.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
if
i
accepted
your
premise,
i
would
agree
with
you.
i
cannot,
under
the
terms
of
my
argument,
accept
the
premise
that
it
imposes
initial
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
fact,
he
goes
to
the
same
jail
as
a
man
who
is
sentenced
to
a
straight
jail
term,
that's
correct.
and
in
fact
as
a
man
pays
his
fine,
he
does
go
to
jail.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
and
who
pays
the
fine,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
just
what
happens.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
does
not
violate
the
constitution
because
under
this
traditional
equal
protection
test
which
this
court
has
set
up,
if
we
shown
irrational
class,
those
who
do
not
pay,
rational
state
objectives
to
be
achieved
in
a
rational
connection
between
the
two
of
the
work
off
system.
it
doesn't
violate
equal
protection
even
though
it
may
treat
some
people
differently
than
others.
but
even
if
we
move
beyond
that
traditional
test,
as
this
court
has
moved
in
some
areas.
for
example,
in
the
shapiro
case,
testing
whether
or
not
a
one
year's
residency
require
it
for
welfare,
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
where
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
in
cases
involving
the
exercise
of
constitutional
right,
you
have
to
show
a
compelling
state
interest,
not
merely
a
rational
relationship
or
some
other
cases
which
have
essentially
used
a
balancing
approach
to
the
advantages
gained
by
the
state,
outweigh
the
disadvantages
to
the
defendant.
we
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
rest
of
the
states
of
the
union,
in
preserving
the
idea
that
this
does
not
violate
equal
protection,
this
and
allied
practices
such
as
the
area
of
bail,
is
so
strong
that
it
outweighs
the
disadvantage
to
the
indigent
defendant
even
if
the
test
is
compelling
state
interest
or
the
balancing
of
advantages
to
one
side.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
indigency
excused
a
man
from
incarceration
under
the
work
off
system,
that
the
threat
to
other
state
interests,
including
the
maintenance
of
the
whole
fine
system,
the
maintenance
of
the
courts
which
enforce
the
fine
system,
especially
in
those
cases
where
the
fine
is
the
only
penalty
and
the
maintenance,
the
monetary
bail
system
and
the
potential
saddling
of
all
those
courts
with
spurious
claims
of
indigency
which
do
not
now
arise
because
a
man
knows
if
he
doesn't
pay
his
fine,
he's
going
to
jail
to
work
it
off,
are
so
compelling
that
they
outweigh
whatever
disadvantages
there
are
in
sending
an
indigent
man
to
jail
to
work
off
his
fine.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
we
probably
would.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
the
man
goes
to
jail
for
no
more
than
30
days
in
lieu
with
paying
off
the
fine.
the
federal
government
has
it
too.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
under
the
federal
statute?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i'm
not
sure
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
illinois
there
is
no
such,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
we
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
there
are
two
considerations,
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
if
we're
going
to
consider
the
question
of
alternatives
to
the
work
off
system
which
are
thought
to
be
less
onerous
to
the
indigent
defendant
than
the
work
off
system.
the
first
question
which
arises
is,
is
it
within
the
province
of
this
court
to
examine
whether
there
are
viable
alternatives?
or
must
this
court,
in
an
equal
protection
case
refrain
from
deciding
what
is
a
wiser,
what
is
a
more
humane,
what
is
a
more
just
system
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i'm
not
sure.
if
we
were
--
if
we
were
following
the
traditional
test
of
equal
protection
cases,
we
would
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
there
were
in
fact
alternatives.
but
if
we
are
following
what's
been
called
the
balancing
test
or
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
i'm
not
sure
even
there
that
the
same
rule
doesn't
carry
over.
in
other
words,
if
this
court
can
find
a
compelling
state
interest
which
is
carried
out
by
a
rational
scheme
which
the
state
has
selected,
we
think
the
work
off
system,
standing
by
itself
is
a
rational
scheme.
then
i'm
not
so
sure
that
even
in
a
compelling
interest
case,
if
this
is
one.
that
this
court
can
say,
but
we
will
strike
down
the
rational
scheme
because
there
are
other
rational
schemes
which
contain
less
disadvantage
to
the
defendant.
as
this
court
said
just
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
dandridge
case
talking
about
the
maximum
grants
on
welfare
payments.
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
reiterating
again
words
which
have
been
used
for
years
in
equal
protection
cases.
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
other
policies
which
are
available
at
the
state
of
illinois
but
the
question
is,
can
this
court,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
make
the
state
used.
in
illinois,
as
this
court
sits
today,
we
have
a
legislature
sitting
and
we
have
a
constitutional
convention
sitting.
and
i
think
the
arguments
of
mr.
bass
has
made
to
this
court
today
are
more
properly
directed
to
those
two
bodies.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that's
entirely
clear.
i
think
one
of
the
results
of
such
a
holding
would
be
that
some
judges
would
simply
impose
maximum
jail
sentences
where
they
do
not
now
impose
jail
sentences.
i
couldn't
say
that
all
judges
would
do
that.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
sir,
it
would
not
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
this
case,
he
could
not
give
anymore,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
the
danger
of
that
as
a
consequence
to
the
holding
is
great
danger
as
to
the
consequence
to
this
holding
for
the
bail
system,
for
the
whole
system
of
fines
in
the
courts
which
force
that
question.
