justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bass,
going
back
to
this
case,
is
there
anything
of
this
record
that
shows
that
his
incarceration
beyond
the
year
is
any
different
from
a
man
being
sentenced
to
two
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
example,
the
release
on
work
applies
to
a
man
that's
serving
the
sentence
of
just
one
year
and
nothing
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
nothing
just
where
people
are
put
in
because
they
couldn't
pay
a
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
is
the
basis
of
this
argument?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
put
them
in
jail
beyond
the
one
year
period
solely
because
he
was
broke,
was
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
please.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
getting
back
to
this
case,
is
he
out
or
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
bailed
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
does
the
work
release
program
come
up?
he
might
never
qualify
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
also
require
that
he
pay
room
and
board?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case,
if
the
statute
said
one
year,
maximum
of
one
year
period
and
the
judge
thought
that
this
was
a
horrible
case,
and
the
man
said
get
more
time.
he
couldn't
get
him
for
about
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
statute
says
as
it
does
here,
the
year
and
a
$500.00
fine,
the
judge
--
it's
undisputed
the
judge
knows
this
man
is
a
pauper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
had
his
--
i
assume
he
had
probation.
i
mean
he
had
a
sentencing
report,
i'd
assume
so.
and
so
he
says,
well
i
can't
give
this
man
any
more
time
but
i
can
give
him
a
hundred
more
days
by
merely
giving
him
the
$500.00
fine.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
probation
report
said
that
this
man
is
a
millionaire
that
has
a
hobby
of
stealing,
he
couldn't
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
the
judge
couldn't
give
that
man
a
hundred
more
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
way
under
the
sun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
gives
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
he
knew
he
couldn't
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
think
that's
giving
him
a
hundred
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
being?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
both
cases,
he's
in
the
same
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
same
cell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
after
the
one
year,
he's
serving
something
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
theory?
what
about
the
man's
theory?
he's
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
thompson,
i
assume
that
the
jails
are
overcrowded
in
illinois
lately
than
place
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
really?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
the
need
as
to
workers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
the
statute
in
illinois
was
passed
putting
a
head
tax
on
everybody
of
$100.00
a
year
and
all
who
didn't
pay
it
went
to
jail,
would
be
valid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
that
couldn't
pay
it?
man
that
couldn't
have
a
$100.00
in
his
life,
you
could
put
him
to
jail
because
he
didn't
have
$100.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that's
true
in
the
year
of
1970
to
put
a
man
in
jail
because
he
doesn't
have
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
willie
who
doesn't
have
$1.75,
paying
the
tax
or
paying
the
fine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
doesn't
need
the
money
that
he
has,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
the
judge,
when
he
sentenced
this
man
know
that
he
wasn't
getting
a
single
dollar
out
of
willie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
he
wanted
was
to
extend
the
one
year
sentence,
that's
all
he
was
interested
in
doing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
can
you
give
me
any
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
a
hundred
--
so
far
as
jail
was
concerned
was
a
hundred
--
one
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
sentenced
him
to
one
year
and
100
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
see
anything
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
getting
to
what
i
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
preclude
that
that's
true.
there
are
few
in
the
illustration
you've
mentioned,
to
driving
automobiles
around
to
the
country,
couldn't
pay
a
$5.00
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
had
some
experiences
of
prosecutions
in
my
state.
i
do
not
recall
a
single
one
where
they
were
not
able
to
pay
except
somebody
who
had
stolen
the
car
or
something
of
that
nature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
this
amounts
to,
which
has
to
be
paid
is
that
it
imposes
a
punishment
upon
a
man
who
has
no
money,
cannot
possibly
be
imposed
on
a
man
who
has
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i'
not
talking
about
the
premises.
i'm
talking
about
terms
of
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact,
it
amounts
sending
a
man
to
jail
without
his
fine
and
who
is
indigent,
you
do
not
send
a
man
to
jail
who
has
money
and
is
not
indigent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
it
results.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
question
is,
does
that
violate
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
going
to
state
your
balancing
in
a
little
different
way.
let's
forget
about
the
theories.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
state
has
such
a
compelling
interest
in
making
indigent
serve
time
that
no
one
else
has
to
serve
in
the
state.
it
has
simply
brought
the
state's
efforts
to
fall.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
hard
time
convincing
the
indigent
is
that
reasonable
but
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
for
hearing
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
also
a
hearing
before
that's
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
practice,
would
you
--
will
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
doesn't
apply
to
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
gave
the
over
maximum.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bass,
going
back
to
this
case,
is
there
anything
of
this

that
shows
that
his

beyond
the

the

applies

nothing

justice
thurgood

this
is
nothing

where

justice
thurgood

so
what
is

i

your

was
that
put

justice
thurgood

please.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
getting
back
to
this
case,
is
he
out
or
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
bailed
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
does
the
work
release
program
come
up?
he
might
never

justice
thurgood

does
it
also
require

justice
thurgood

but
in
this
case,
if
the

and
the
judge
thought
that
this
was
a

and
the

he
couldn't
get
him
for
about
a
year.
justice
thurgood

but
if
the

says
as
it
does
here,
the

it's

well
he
had
his
--
i
assume
he
had
probation.
i
mean
he
had
a
sentencing
report,
i'd
assume
so.
and
so
he
says,
well
i
can't
give
this
man
any
more
time
but
i
can
give
him
a
hundred
more
days
by
merely
giving

the
$500.00

on
the

probation
report

justice
thurgood

i

the

couldn't
give
that
man
a
hundred
more

justice
thurgood
marshall
no
way
under

justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
gives
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
he
knew
he
couldn't
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
think
that's
giving
him
a
hundred
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
being?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
both
cases,
he's
in
the
same
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
same
cell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
after
the
one

he's
serving
something

justice
thurgood

the

what
about
the

theory?
he's
in

justice
thurgood

mr.

justice
thurgood

do
you
think
that's
true
in
the
year
of
1970
to
put
a
man
in
jail
because
he
doesn't
have
money?
justice
thurgood

what's
the
difference
between
willie
who
doesn't
have
$1.75,
paying
the
tax
or
paying
the

justice
thurgood

the

that

is
