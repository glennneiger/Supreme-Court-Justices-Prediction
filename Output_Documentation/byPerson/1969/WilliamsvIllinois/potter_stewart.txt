justice
potter
stewart
how
long
was
he
actually
in
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
could
the
state
insist
that
we
pay
the
fine
by
working
for
the
state,
and
i
don't
say
in
a
workhouse
or
in
a
work
farm
or
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
suggesting
i
take
it,
just
a
moment
ago,
that
there
were
circumstances
under
which
the
state
could
keep
the
man
in
jail
around
the
clock,
weren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
he
refuses
to
work.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
no
jobs
are
available
in
the
community
that
he
can
get,
must
the
state
furnish
him
the
opportunity
to
work
on
its
own
payroll?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
perhaps
you
told
us,
but
if
so,
i
didn't
get
it
clearly.
as
i
read
the
illinois
revised
statute
1967,
chapter
38
paragraph
180-6,
its
language
would
seem
entirely
to
take
care
of
your
claim,
however,
i
understand
that
it's
been
construed
by
the
illinois
courts
in
such
a
way
as
to
mean
something
other
than
what
it
seems
rather
clearly
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
has
illinois
suit
reviewed?
how
the
illinois
courts
construed
it?
justice
potter
stewart
many
of
them,
as
i
understand
it,
do
not
--
i
have
so
--
do
not
have
illinois
as
the
provision
that
illinois
has
that
if
a
man
in
fact
is
unable
to
work
off
his
fine,
he
must
be
released
and
am
i
not
right
that
many
states
to
apply
that
sort
of
a
release
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
and
many
of
those
other
47
states
do
not.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
legislature
has
done
this,
isn't
it?
it's
the
legislature
that
has
all
these
powers,
this
is
exactly
what
the
legislature
has
done
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
legislature
has
proved,
as
i
understood
that
this
case
is
about
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
said
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
and
he
cannot
pay
his
fine,
he
can
be
put
in
jail
instead.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
case
is
about
and
that's
--
the
legislature
has
done
this,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
may,
according
to
you
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
say
that
the
punishment
for
any
offense
can
be
a
fine
up
to
$5.00
or
imprisonment
up
to
five
days,
isn't
it?
