chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
nest
case
on
for
argument
is
number
1089,
williams
against
illinois.
mr.
bass,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
supreme
of
illinois
had
judicial
power
to
shape
that
kind
of
solution
to
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
--
was
that
done
in
the
context
of
the
old
notions
of
imprisonment
for
debt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
don't
complain
about
the
rate
of
the
workout,
that
this
$5.00
a
day
if
he
goes
home
at
night.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
raising
that
here
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
consider
the
compelled
presence
and
requirements
of
work
in
the
day
--
daytime
hours
as
a
form
of
incarceration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
separate
proceeding
for
that
to
determine
this,
the
factual
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
put
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
what
the
reasonable
value
of
services
would
be
in
the
place
of
$5.00
a
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that,
in
your
judgment,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
would
that
have
to
be
tailored
to
his
capacities
or
could
the
illinois
legislature
fix
another
figure
such
$16.00
a
day
or
based
on
the
minimum
wage
which
i
guess
is
a
$1.60
times
eight
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
problem
with
your
argument
counsel
is
that
i
can
understand
someone
rationally
fixing
a
rate
for
his
services.
i
have
some
difficulty
seeing
how
you
put
a
rate
on
his
liberty
by
the
hour.
you
seem
to
imply
that
they
might
rationally
fix
some
x
dollars
per
hour
for
depriving
him
of
his
liberty.
where
is
your
basis
for
doing
that?
how
do
you
measure
the
value
of
a
man's
freedom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
thank
you.
mr.
thompson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
to
that
counsel,
how
far
back
is
the
$5.00
a
day
measure
go?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
go
over
from
an
old
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
thompson
i
have
a
question,
it
won't
take
too
long
i
hope.
is
it
possible
that
in
considering
these
various
alternatives
that
a
holding
along
the
lines,
holding
adverse
to
the
state
of
illinois
in
this
case,
could
lead
judges
to
impose
direct
prison
penal
sentences
without
the
alternative
of
a
fine
and
then
produce
what
is
a
new
term
to
me
these
days,
counterproductive
consequences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
my
question
was
addressed
to
the
consequences
of
a
holding,
not
to
any
consequence
on
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
thompson.
mr.
bass
you
have
five
minutes
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
about
this
last
thing
that
if
you
seem
to
have
some
spare
time,
do
you
think
there's
a
so-called
counter
productive
possibility
or
potential
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wasn't
thinking
so
much
of
traffic
court
as
the
misdemeanor
court
dealing
with
behavior
not
as
serious
as
the
behavior
involved
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
matter
of
your
view
then
i
take
it
is
that
there
is
no
potential
for
the
--
what
i've
characterized
as
counterproductive
results.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
take
that
step,
don't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
almost
--
you've
almost
gone
around
the
circle
now
on
my
counterproductive
proposition.
you
said
the
legislature
might
respond
by
making
greater
class,
number
of
classes
of
crimes
subject
to
imprisonment
which
are
now
subject
only
to
fines
as
a
response
to
a
holding
that
you
can't
have
an
alternative
for
a
poor
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bass,
thank
you
mr.
thompson.
