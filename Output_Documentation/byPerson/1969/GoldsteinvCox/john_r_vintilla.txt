mr.
john
r.
vintilla
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
before
the
court
today
a
problem,
which
this
court
had
occasion
approximately
two
years
ago
to
review
the
pass
judgment
on
it.
we
have
in
review
here,
the
so-called
iron
curtain
statute
for
the
state
of
new
york
known
as
the
new
york
surrogate's
procedure
act
to
formerly
section
269-a
and
now
for
the
reason
amendment
of
june
of
'68
known
as
section
2218.
now,
this
statute
in
substance
provides
that
an
heir
legatee
or
beneficiary
of
funds
from
the
state
or
other
source
in
new
york
who
happens
to
reside
in
one
of
so-called
iron
curtain
countries
that
the
state
of
new
york
will
protect
this
particular
citizen
national
of
that
country
by
withholding
the
transmittal
of
his
distributive
share
to
funds
that
he
is
entitled
to.
if
he
would
not
have
the
benefit
or
use
for
control
of
the
money
or
other
property
to
him
or
if
there
are
other
special
circumstances
that
make
a
desirable
of
such
payment
it
should
be
withheld.
now,
this
law
of
new
york
is
substantially
identical
to
one
of
the
three
provisions
of
the
oregon
statute,
which
this
court
struck
down
as
an
impermissible
interference
with
federal
power
over
foreign
affairs.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
your
honor,
the
new
york
law
is
a
custodial
in
nature
that
provides
--
does
not
provide
for
escheat.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
under
any
circumstances.
the
money
is
placed
in
all
appellates,
its
placed
in
the
deposit
in
one
of
the
banks
in
new
york
until
such
time
as
the
particular
heir
or
beneficiary
is
representing
and
could
come
in
and
satisfy
the
court
that
he
will
have
the
use
benefit
or
that
circumstances
of
change
and
then
the
court
could
reconsider
the
matter.
as
a
practical
matter
funds
belonging
to
romania
nationals
of
been
brought
in
excess
of
25
years
as
the
matter
now
stands.
there
was
one
challenge
to
the
statute
by
romania
heirs
the
greenburg
case,
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
in
that
case
the
heir
sought
to
establish
to
the
satisfaction
onto
a
surrogate
of
new
york
county
that
they
do
have
to
use
benefit
and
control
in
that
circumstances
are
such
in
romania
that
that
to
be
permitted
to
have
their
money.
and,
the
surrogate
there
found
that
the
evidence
was
in
such
an
issue
to
convince
him
that
they
would
have
to
use
benefit
in
control
or
the
circumstance
of
change.
now,
this
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
and
they
denied
leave
to
appeal
allow
the
surrogate's
decision
and
the
appellate
court
which
affirm
and
allow
that
decision
to
stand.
now,
in
our
case,
citizens
who
are
entitled
to
have
been
or
are
entitled
to
funds
which
are
bring
withheld
from
them
challenged
the
new
york
statute
by
filing
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
then
sought
to
have
its
application
enjoined
and
so
far
as
the
rights
of
romania
national
are
concerned.
at
the
same
time,
they
asked
for
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
to
hear
the
congressional
challenges
to
the
new
york
statute.
the
district
judge
initially
denied
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
on
the
ground
that
he
thought
the
constitutional
challenges
were
frivolous
and
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
the
court
right
from
the
bench
affirmed
the
district
judge
in
holding
that
the
constitutional
challenge
is
not
serious
enough
to
convene
a
court
in
upon
certiorari
granted
by
this
court.
now,
this
court
some
merely
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
further
conservation
in
the
light
of
zschernig
v.
miller
which
this
court
had
decided
while
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending
initially.
now,
at
that
stage,
we
had
thought
upon
reading
discerning
decision
that
because
of
the
swiping
rational
of
the
majority
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
--
and
the
new
york
statute
being
so
similar
to
the
oregon's
statute
that,
that
question
would
put
to
rest.
that
similar
statutes
which
such
as
new
york
were
unconstitutional
because
they
were
enacted
in
such
a
fashion
that
they
compel
the
courts
to
intrude
into
an
area.
that
is
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
federal
government.
upon
hearing
by
the
three-judge
court,
--
the
three-judge
court
found
otherwise,
the
matter
was
heard
in
--
before
the
three-judge
court
in
june
of
25th,
1968
and
sure
that
before
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
occasion
for
the
first
time
since
zschernig
to
review
the
new
york
law
in
the
light
of
the
zschernig
decision.
and
that
was
the
case
which
is
mentioned
in
both
brief
the
matter
of
liken,
and
in
that
case,
new
york
court
of
appeals
felt
that
under
record
of
that
case,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
new
york
courts
have
engaged
in
any
of
the
activities
that
were
proscribe
by
zschernig.
and,
felt
that
the
statute
of
new
york
is
not
unconstitutional.
well,
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
by
the
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
felt
that
upon
the
record
before
it
that
the
--
there
is
no
showing
that
the
new
york
courts
have
engaged
in
the
activities
proscribe
by
zschernig.
now,
the
matter
of
court
--
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
had
the
matter
before
on
a
motion
for
some
re-judgment.
the
matter
was
filed
before
the
decision
of
zschernig
and
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
zschernig,
the
appellants
filed
a
motion
for
some
re-judgment
on
the
strength
of
the
conclusions
that
put
to
be
drawn
from
a
zschernig.
and
in
support
of
that
motion
for
some
re-judgment,
the
appellants
attached
an
affidavit
and
which
there
were
set
fort
many
cases
and
instances
which
appellant
sought
to
establish
that
the
new
york
courts
in
interpreting
and
in
construing
the
new
york
statute
were
in
the
fact
engaging
in
activities
proscribed
by
zschernig.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
romanian
interest,
greenburg
has
established
a
precedent
that
as
a
result
of
that
--
as
a
result
of
the
finding
in
greenburg
that
all
other
courts
and
followed
greenburg
as
holding
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
resident
for
city
of
romani,
thereby
you
were
not
entitled
to
have
your
money
because
of
that
decision
of
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
withholding
these
funds
from
these
appellants.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
in
greenburg,
the
three-judge
court
had
determined
that
there
was
no
showing
that
any
courts
had
engaged
in
any
proscribe
of
activities
yet,
the
greenburg
decision
which
was
before
the
court
very
clearly
shows
that
the
court
engaged
in
such
post
crime
activities
in
seeking
to
convince
the
court
that
money
should
be
released.
the
parties,
the
romanian
and
plaintiffs
in
that
case
had
summoned
the
chief
for
the
counselors
section
of
a
domain
in
the
legation
at
that
time
and
to
testify
with
reference
to
the
inheritance
laws
of
romania
and
to
the
relevant
laws
would
reference
to
the
problem
at
hand.
and,
after
establishing
his
expertise
in
the
matter,
and
testifying
that
there
are
no
restrictions,
the
court
refused
to
give
any
credence
to
the
testimony
of
this
expert
who
according
to
my
understand
ever
who
was
not
impeached
in
anyway.
and,
moreover,
the
court
in
reaching
his
conclusion
had
to
consider
the
foreign
exchange
control
of
the
laws
of
romania
and,
in
doing
so,
the
court
found
that
he
did
not
like
the
rate
of
exchange
that
these
citizens
of
romania
were
receiving
and
therefore
held
that
in
effective
of
confiscatory
and
by
reason
of
that,
that
they
would
not
have
to
use
benefit
in
control
of
the
funds.
this
same
position
on
the
foreign
exchange
allows
was
also
taken
by
the
appellate
court
which
affirmed
to
decision
of
the
surrogate
and
the
surrogate
somehow
and
i'm
not
familiar
where
the
surrogate
came
to
the
conclusion
that
romanian
lei
which
is
the
romanian
currency
could
be
purchased
here
in
the
united
states
and
new
york
had
a
very
high
rate
of
exchange
certainly
much
higher
than
the
official
exchange
and
use
that
as
a
basis
to
conclude
that
the
--
since
the
exchange
are
such
of
discrepancy
and
what
you
can
buy
currency
in
new
york
and
what
official
exchanges
that
therefore
these
people
were
not
getting
all
they
what
they
are
entitled
to.
now,
i
don't
know
where
that
greenburg
court
had
got
in
the
exchange
of
31
and
¾
of
my
understanding
romanian
law
does
not
permit
any
of
their
currency
to
come
in
from
abroad
or,
they
do
not
sell
it
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
official
anywhere
in
the
world
that
31
and
¾
allay
to
a
dollar
presumably
there
is
a
black
market
in
that
exchange.
but
i
don't
see
how
a
black
market
rate
of
exchange
could
furnish
the
basis
of
illegal
decision.
but,
in
any
event,
we
have
other
showings
in
the
affidavit
that
support
of
the
motion
for
some
re-judgment
showing
that
the
various
attitudes
of
the
state
controller
who
has
some
of
these
funds
under
his
custody.
and,
the
courts
that
they
have
engaged
in
attitude
that
certainly
clearly
proscribe
by
a
zschernig.
now,
interestingly
enough,
the
only
authority
is
in
the
united
states
that
i
have
knowledge
of
a
do
not
or
still
at
here
to
this
iron
curtain
statute
in
type
of
law
is
the
state
in
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
of
montana.
but,
in
my
experience,
in
the
last
10
years
in
many
of
other
jurisdictions
of
florida
and
maryland
and
connecticut
and
new
jersey
and
ohio
and
michigan
all
have
statutes
which
i
think
were
copied
from
the
new
york
statute
which
are
substantially
identical.
and,
these
are
--
all
of
these
of
jurisdictions
and
the
courts
in
these
jurisdictions
have
not
applied
their
iron
curtain
statute
to
the
rights
of
the
romanian
interest
once
they
were
aware
and
were
pointed
with
the
financial
agreement
of
1960
between
arab
country
and
romania
whereby
our
country
had
released
all
blocking
controls
and
restriction
regarding
the
transmittal
of
public
funds
to
romanian.
and,
ever
since
then,
they
have
been
sending
such
things
as
social
security
benefits
and
various
pensions
and
other
public
funds.
and,
more
interesting
since
zschernig,
the
state
of
oregon
has
held
its
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
california
is
--
and
the
reason
appellate
decision
on
october
9th
of
this
year
in
california
state
of
kramer
also
follows
there
and
he
held
that
by
reason
of
the
holding
in
zschernig
that
their
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and,
in
montana,
we
have
the
situation
in
ad
valorem
case,
there
was
up
before
this
court
and
decided
in
january
of
this
year
were
the
appropriate
court
found
that
in
view
of
zschernig
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
court
in
vorem
versus
fall
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
constitutionally.
and,
therefore,
did
not
follow
it
however,
the
attorney
general
disagreed
and
he
presently
have
filed
an
appeal
to
the
probate
court's
decision
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
montana.
now,
we
have
a
recent
decision
from
three-judge
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
eastern
division
which
to
my
knowledge
is
not
reported
where
an
identical
action
was
filed
challenging
the
iron
curtain
statute
of
ohio
by
a
certain
czechoslovakian
heirs.
and,
the
statute
in
ohio
is
substantially
identical
as
the
new
york
statute,
it's
a
custodial
statute
and
it
provides
that
the
heir
has
the
burden
to
prove
that
he
has
the
use
for
control
of
--
would
have
the
use
and
control
of
the
funds
or
that
special
circumstances
in
the
country
of
his
residence
would
not
prevent
him
from
using
and
enjoying
his
property
without
confiscation
or
hold
or
impart.
and,
i
think
that
my
position
would
reference
to
the
new
york
statute
is
very
well
said
out
by
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
ohio
case
of
maro
versus
batten.
they
may
are
all
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
no,
i
don't
believe
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
have
--
the
matter
was
unreported.
i
thought
it
would
be
reported
and
therefore
and
have
guessed
we
over
looked
it
and
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
decide
in
july
of
this
year
by
a
three-judge
court,
we
certainly
will
furnish
the
court
if
the
court's
question
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes,
as
far
as
i
know
yes
your
honor,
it's
unreported
and
it's
maro
versus
batten.
and,
in
that
--
they
have
the
same
problem,
the
same
action
challenging
the
constitutional.
i'm
asking
for
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
that
court
in
striking
down
and
following
zschernig
states
that
it
follows.
the
so-called
iron
curtain
statute
such
211381
and
that
is
the
ohio
statute
were
recently
considered
by
the
united
stated
supreme
court
in
zschernig
versus
miller
and
then
it
goes
on
to
elaborate
on
the
type
of
statue
of
oregon
have
the
three
provisions.
and
then
in
its
appeal
in
the
court
when
i
to
say
further
“in
passing
upon
the
validity
of
the
statute,”
the
supreme
court
consider
the
whole
area
of
reciprocal
inheritance
statutes.
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
reciprocal
inheritance
statutes
which
permits
the
state
court
only
to
re-construe
on
the
apply
laws
of
foreign
nation.
and,
those
which
permit
the
court
--
state
court
to
launch
enquiries
and
to
the
type
of
governments
that
obtain
in
a
particular
foreign
nation.
citing
its
earlier
decision
in
clark
versus
allen,
the
court
noted
that
state
courts
are
not
precluded
from
really
construing
and
applying
laws
of
a
foreign
nation.
the
court
held
however
that
where
statute
permits
inquiry
and
to
the
type
of
government
existing
in
a
foreign
nation.
or
into
the
operation
of
that
government
or
into
the
question
of
whether
the
legal
rights
guaranteed
by
the
nation
or
rights
in
fact
or
into
the
question
of
whether
statements
by
the
representatives
of
foreign
nations
are
credible
or
made
in
good
faith.
or
into
the
likelihood
that
the
legatees
will
actually
receive
the
property
left
to
them
such
statutes
so
applied
intrudes
into
the
exclusive
right
of
congress
to
regulate
foreign
policy.
section
211381,
ohio
revised
code
which
is
a
statute
that
issue
in
the
present
case
is
someone
different
from
the
oregon
statute
involved
in
zschernig.
in
ohio,
the
statute
requires
the
probate
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
foreign
legatee
will
have
to
been
further
use
or
control
of
the
money
left
him
because
of
circumstances
prevailing
at
that
the
place
of
residence
of
such
legatee.
the
ohio
statute
does
appear
to
be
directed
had
an
inquiry
into
the
operation
of
the
foreign
government
and
into
the
political
economic
and
social
conditions
prevailing
in
the
foreign
country.
this
type
of
inquiry
is
specifically
prohibited
by
the
doctrine
of
zschernig
versus
miller
and
we
say
that
that
exact
language
had
exact
argument
as
applicable
to
the
new
york
statute
here
under
review
because
this
statute
also
provides
that
if
there
is
a
special
circumstance
--
special
circumstances
that
the
points
of
residence
which
would
make
it
appear
that
the
party
would
have
not
have
the
money
then
the
court
could
withhold
the
funds.

district,
the
eastern
division.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes,
for
three-judge
court.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
maro
versus
batten.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes
your
honor.
it
was
decided
in
july
of
69,
but
since
so
far
as
i
know
and
as
i
have
been
asked,
naval
ascertain,
it's
unreported.
now,
in
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
i
think
this
court
in
the
majority
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
made
it
clear
that
the
fatality
of
the
infection
that's
involved
is
that
the
statute
is
freeing
in
such
a
manner
that
they
compels
the
court
to
go
into
internal
matters,
to
go
into
the
nature
of
the
government,
the
policy
of
the
government,
the
laws
of
the
government
and
the
laws
of
the
government
were
relations
to
their
citizens.
and
because
these
statutes
are
framed
in
such
a
way,
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
these
courts
are
intruding
into
an
area
that's
the
exclusive
domain
or
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
oh
yes
and
they
still
--
i
would
and
i
think
zschernig
makes
it
clear
that
they
still
have
a
right
to
applying
construe
and
this
maro
case
say
so.
but,
in
our
situation
they
are
not
applying
and
construing,
they
are
going
much
further.
the
way
the
statute
is
framed,
it's
even
difficult
to
determine
what
evidence
you
would
need
to
convince
a
court
that
they
have
to
use
benefit
from
all
the
cases
and
the
cases
are
repelled
what
example
or
you
bring
an
expert.
you
bring
an
expert
to
testify,
we
have
that
case
and
we
have
a
case
in
new
york
in
the
matter
of
dragonov
involving
bulgarian
areas.
and
they
brought
a
specialist
--
an
attorney
from
bulgaria
specializes
in
civil
family
law
and
in
inheritance
law
and
a
member
of
a
firm
in
sophia
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
were
reference
to
his
testimony.
the
court
cannot
disregard
the
fact
of
mr.
stephanof.
he
is
not
a
free
and
independent
attorney
and
an
impression
he
sought
to
create
as
a
member
of
a
lawyer's
collective
subject
to
the
restrictive
pressures
commonly
applied
in
iron
curtain
countries.
as
he
was
about
to
return
to
bulgaria,
he
cannot
be
expected
to
say
anything
interrogation
of
his
government
or
its
physical
policies.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
the
state
department
is
sometimes
on
both
sides
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
no,
not
in
the
present
case.
there
is
--
where
there
is
a
letter
that
the
state
department
sent
to
governor
rockefeller
after
the
financial
agree
when
1960
requested
that
he
advice
the
new
york
authorities
that
the
federal
policy
now
permits
the
transfer
of
funds
to
romania
and
that
evidence
he
was
ignored
by
the
state
authority
to
probate
surrogate
judges.
and
at
the
same
time
which
we
have
letters
in
the
state
department
saying
that,
this
is
a
purely
a
matter
of
a
state
law
the
administration
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
we
--
i
know
that
they
have
not
filed
any
brief
here
as
amicus
through
in
any
capacity
whatsoever.
they
have
not
taken
any
official
position
insofar
as
i
am
aware
in
this
--
come
before
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
state
department
is
not
injecting
itself
for
directly.
perhaps,
i
think
there
has
been
some
letters
that
other
attorneys
and
i
think
it's
in
amicus
brief
that
they
shall
await
the
outcome
of
this
particular
problem
before
the
court
the
today.
but,
i
think
that
the
reading
of
zschernig,
i
think
that
the
reasonable
conclusion
be
drawn
from
that
that
new
york
connected
to
such
statute
because
it
dislikes
the
particular
governmental
systems
and
the
policies
of
these
countries.
and
that
was
the
new
york's
way
of
reacting
in
a
hostile
fashion
saying,
where
do
you
--
you
appropriate
properties
of
our
nationals
and
you
have
a
system
where
you
deny
your
citizens
the
right
to
private
property
and
because
of
that,
they
have
enacted
the
statute
to
react
to
say,
well,
if
you
do
all
those
things,
we're
going
to
withhold
funds
belonging
to
your
citizens.
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
the
one
that
causes
the
statute
to
invalid
because
this
is
not
a
function
of
the
state.
a
very
state
in
our
union
would
react
in
such
a
of
fashion
and
go
different
ways
on
a
purely
international
problem
we
have
chaos.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
think
congress
certain
to
federal
government
this
is
an
area
that
they
can
legislate
on
certainly
government
could've
congress
can
act
in
this
area
and
any
action
taken
by
the
federal
government
was
certainly
be
overwriting
and
the
certain
any
state
law
that
contravenes
it
would
have
to
fall.
i
think
that
in
our
situation
here
with
this
financial
agreement
i
think
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
gorum
case
and
which
was
joined
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
fortas
he
said
that
federal
policy
permits
the
free
flow
of
funds
to
romania
which
is
true
and
that
no
state
judge,
they
make
or
apply
rule.
that
is
contrary
to
that
policy
which
is
true,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
the
problem
is
a
difficult
to
see
and
our
estimation
of
it
perhaps
we're
so
obsessed
and
studies
for
many
years.
but,
if
your
federal
government
does
one
thing
and
the
state
comes
and
says,
well
because
the
federal
government
for
awhile
was
permitting
funds.
and
there
are
still
countries
where
he
did
step
in
an
action
this
area
but
when
he
steps
in
the
area
made
a
determination
that
these
people
will
have
the
use
of
benefit.
there
is
a
reasonable
insurance
conditions
are
such
for
a
state
to
come
in
and
make
a
contrary
determination
to
that
made
by
the
federal
government
which
is
entrusted
with
these
matters
which
is
in
a
better
position
to
make
such
a
determination
and
new
york
has
said
this.
and
interestingly
enough
in
the
area
where
they
refuse
to
transmit
money,
they
were
allowed
federal
policy.
they
have
said
in
the
leading
case
prior
case
that
the
federal
government
in
the
better
position
to
know
what
the
situation
is
in
romania.
and
therefore
since
the
federal
government
does
not
permit
the
sending
of
fund,
we
can
rely
and
follow
that
policy
and
withhold
the
transcript
of
fund.
yet,
when
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
position
of
free
flow,
the
new
york
is
still
maintain
the
other
position
and
that
is
the
followed
federal
policy
that
would
satisfy
them
and
when
they
like
federal
policy,
when
they
didn't
like
federal
policy
they
refuse
to
go
on.
and
i
think
that
is
the
problem
here,
there's
no
question
about
it
and
the
states
who
seen
it
except
new
york.
all
of
the
authorities
have
seen
it
and
there
are
many
states
which
would
not
in
that
such
a
law.
illinois
refused
governor
kerner
refused
to
approve
such
a
law
difficult
all
because
he
says
“we're
getting
in
to
an
area
that
will
exceed
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
state
and
we
should
enact
in
such
an
area
and
let
the
federal
government
act
in
such
an
area.”
and
therefore,
i
say,
that
the
decision
below
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
constitutional
conclusion
of
this
court
in
zschernig
and
should
be
reversed
and
these
people
are
dire
need
of
their
money.
many
of
them
have
passed
away
and
many
amounts
are
very
modest
should
have
their
money
at
the
earliest
possible
moment.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
think
that
that
may
and
they
treat
everyone
equally
without
discriminating
with
aliens.
it's
traditionally,
the
authority
of
a
state
in
that
area
to
perhaps
eliminate
but
i
think
they
have
to
do
on
a
constitutional
fashion.
and
they
--
it
was
in
the
confines
of
their
traditional
probate
authority
without
exceeding
is
they
have
here
and
what
i'm
trying
to
make
foreign
policy
as
new
york
is
in
our
opinion
and
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
before
the
court
today
a
problem,
which
this
court
had
occasion
approximately
two
years
ago
to
review
the
pass
judgment
on
it.
we
have
in
review
here,
the
so-called
iron
curtain
statute
for
the
state
of
new
york
known
as
the
new
york
surrogate's
procedure
act
to
formerly
section
269-a
and
now
for
the
reason
amendment
of
june
of
'68
known
as
section
2218.
now,
this
statute
in
substance
provides
that
an
heir
legatee
or
beneficiary
of
funds
from
the
state
or
other
source
in
new
york
who
happens
to
reside
in
one
of
so-called
iron
curtain
countries
that
the
state
of
new
york
will
protect
this
particular
citizen
national
of
that
country
by
withholding
the
transmittal
of
his
distributive
share
to
funds
that
he
is
entitled
to.
if
he
would
not
have
the
benefit
or
use
for
control
of
the
money
or
other
property
to
him
or
if
there
are
other
special
circumstances
that
make
a
desirable
of
such
payment
it
should
be
withheld.
now,
this
law
of
new
york
is
substantially
identical
to
one
of
the
three
provisions
of
the
oregon
statute,
which
this
court
struck
down
as
an
impermissible
interference
with
federal
power
over
foreign
affairs.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
your
honor,
the
new
york
law
is
a
custodial
in
nature
that
provides
--
does
not
provide
for
escheat.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
under
any
circumstances.
the
money
is
placed
in
all
appellates,
its
placed
in
the
deposit
in
one
of
the
banks
in
new
york
until
such
time
as
the
particular
heir
or
beneficiary
is
representing
and
could
come
in
and
satisfy
the
court
that
he
will
have
the
use
benefit
or
that
circumstances
of
change
and
then
the
court
could
reconsider
the
matter.
as
a
practical
matter
funds
belonging
to
romania
nationals
of
been
brought
in
excess
of
25
years
as
the
matter
now
stands.
there
was
one
challenge
to
the
statute
by
romania
heirs
the
greenburg
case,
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
in
that
case
the
heir
sought
to
establish
to
the
satisfaction
onto
a
surrogate
of
new
york
county
that
they
do
have
to
use
benefit
and
control
in
that
circumstances
are
such
in
romania
that
that
to
be
permitted
to
have
their
money.
and,
the
surrogate
there
found
that
the
evidence
was
in
such
an
issue
to
convince
him
that
they
would
have
to
use
benefit
in
control
or
the
circumstance
of
change.
now,
this
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
and
they
denied
leave
to
appeal
allow
the
surrogate's
decision
and
the
appellate
court
which
affirm
and
allow
that
decision
to
stand.
now,
in
our
case,
citizens
who
are
entitled
to
have
been
or
are
entitled
to
funds
which
are
bring
withheld
from
them
challenged
the
new
york
statute
by
filing
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
then
sought
to
have
its
application
enjoined
and
so
far
as
the
rights
of
romania
national
are
concerned.
at
the
same
time,
they
asked
for
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
to
hear
the
congressional
challenges
to
the
new
york
statute.
the
district
judge
initially
denied
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
on
the
ground
that
he
thought
the
constitutional
challenges
were
frivolous
and
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
the
court
right
from
the
bench
affirmed
the
district
judge
in
holding
that
the
constitutional
challenge
is
not
serious
enough
to
convene
a
court
in
upon
certiorari
granted
by
this
court.
now,
this
court
some
merely
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
further
conservation
in
the
light
of
zschernig
v.
miller
which
this
court
had
decided
while
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending
initially.
now,
at
that
stage,
we
had
thought
upon
reading
discerning
decision
that
because
of
the
swiping
rational
of
the
majority
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
--
and
the
new
york
statute
being
so
similar
to
the
oregon's
statute
that,
that
question
would
put
to
rest.
that
similar
statutes
which
such
as
new
york
were
unconstitutional
because
they
were
enacted
in
such
a
fashion
that
they
compel
the
courts
to
intrude
into
an
area.
that
is
the
exclusive
domain
of
the
federal
government.
upon
hearing
by
the
three-judge
court,
--
the
three-judge
court
found
otherwise,
the
matter
was
heard
in
--
before
the
three-judge
court
in
june
of
25th,
1968
and
sure
that
before
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
occasion
for
the
first
time
since
zschernig
to
review
the
new
york
law
in
the
light
of
the
zschernig
decision.
and
that
was
the
case
which
is
mentioned
in
both
brief
the
matter
of
liken,
and
in
that
case,
new
york
court
of
appeals
felt
that
under
record
of
that
case,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
new
york
courts
have
engaged
in
any
of
the
activities
that
were
proscribe
by
zschernig.
and,
felt
that
the
statute
of
new
york
is
not
unconstitutional.
well,
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
by
the
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
felt
that
upon
the
record
before
it
that
the
--
there
is
no
showing
that
the
new
york
courts
have
engaged
in
the
activities
proscribe
by
zschernig.
now,
the
matter
of
court
--
the
three-judge
court
in
our
case
had
the
matter
before
on
a
motion
for
some
re-judgment.
the
matter
was
filed
before
the
decision
of
zschernig
and
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
zschernig,
the
appellants
filed
a
motion
for
some
re-judgment
on
the
strength
of
the
conclusions
that
put
to
be
drawn
from
a
zschernig.
and
in
support
of
that
motion
for
some
re-judgment,
the
appellants
attached
an
affidavit
and
which
there
were
set
fort
many
cases
and
instances
which
appellant
sought
to
establish
that
the
new
york
courts
in
interpreting
and
in
construing
the
new
york
statute
were
in
the
fact
engaging
in
activities
proscribed
by
zschernig.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
romanian
interest,
greenburg
has
established
a
precedent
that
as
a
result
of
that
--
as
a
result
of
the
finding
in
greenburg
that
all
other
courts
and
followed
greenburg
as
holding
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
resident
for
city
of
romani,
thereby
you
were
not
entitled
to
have
your
money
because
of
that
decision
of
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
withholding
these
funds
from
these
appellants.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
in
greenburg,
the
three-judge
court
had
determined
that
there
was
no
showing
that
any
courts
had
engaged
in
any
proscribe
of
activities
yet,
the
greenburg
decision
which
was
before
the
court
very
clearly
shows
that
the
court
engaged
in
such
post
crime
activities
in
seeking
to
convince
the
court
that
money
should
be
released.
the
parties,
the
romanian
and
plaintiffs
in
that
case
had
summoned
the
chief
for
the
counselors
section
of
a
domain
in
the
legation
at
that
time
and
to
testify
with
reference
to
the
inheritance
laws
of
romania
and
to
the
relevant
laws
would
reference
to
the
problem
at
hand.
and,
after
establishing
his
expertise
in
the
matter,
and
testifying
that
there
are
no
restrictions,
the
court
refused
to
give
any
credence
to
the
testimony
of
this
expert
who
according
to
my
understand
ever
who
was
not
impeached
in
anyway.
and,
moreover,
the
court
in
reaching
his
conclusion
had
to
consider
the
foreign
exchange
control
of
the
laws
of
romania
and,
in
doing
so,
the
court
found
that
he
did
not
like
the
rate
of
exchange
that
these
citizens
of
romania
were
receiving
and
therefore
held
that
in
effective
of
confiscatory
and
by
reason
of
that,
that
they
would
not
have
to
use
benefit
in
control
of
the
funds.
this
same
position
on
the
foreign
exchange
allows
was
also
taken
by
the
appellate
court
which
affirmed
to
decision
of
the
surrogate
and
the
surrogate
somehow
and
i'm
not
familiar
where
the
surrogate
came
to
the
conclusion
that
romanian
lei
which
is
the
romanian
currency
could
be
purchased
here
in
the
united
states
and
new
york
had
a
very
high
rate
of
exchange
certainly
much
higher
than
the
official
exchange
and
use
that
as
a
basis
to
conclude
that
the
--
since
the
exchange
are
such
of
discrepancy
and
what
you
can
buy
currency
in
new
york
and
what
official
exchanges
that
therefore
these
people
were
not
getting
all
they
what
they
are
entitled
to.
now,
i
don't
know
where
that
greenburg
court
had
got
in
the
exchange
of
31
and
¾
of
my
understanding
romanian
law
does
not
permit
any
of
their
currency
to
come
in
from
abroad
or,
they
do
not
sell
it
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
official
anywhere
in
the
world
that
31
and
¾
allay
to
a
dollar
presumably
there
is
a
black
market
in
that
exchange.
but
i
don't
see
how
a
black
market
rate
of
exchange
could
furnish
the
basis
of
illegal
decision.
but,
in
any
event,
we
have
other
showings
in
the
affidavit
that
support
of
the
motion
for
some
re-judgment
showing
that
the
various
attitudes
of
the
state
controller
who
has
some
of
these
funds
under
his
custody.
and,
the
courts
that
they
have
engaged
in
attitude
that
certainly
clearly
proscribe
by
a
zschernig.
now,
interestingly
enough,
the
only
authority
is
in
the
united
states
that
i
have
knowledge
of
a
do
not
or
still
at
here
to
this
iron
curtain
statute
in
type
of
law
is
the
state
in
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
of
montana.
but,
in
my
experience,
in
the
last
10
years
in
many
of
other
jurisdictions
of
florida
and
maryland
and
connecticut
and
new
jersey
and
ohio
and
michigan
all
have
statutes
which
i
think
were
copied
from
the
new
york
statute
which
are
substantially
identical.
and,
these
are
--
all
of
these
of
jurisdictions
and
the
courts
in
these
jurisdictions
have
not
applied
their
iron
curtain
statute
to
the
rights
of
the
romanian
interest
once
they
were
aware
and
were
pointed
with
the
financial
agreement
of
1960
between
arab
country
and
romania
whereby
our
country
had
released
all
blocking
controls
and
restriction
regarding
the
transmittal
of
public
funds
to
romanian.
and,
ever
since
then,
they
have
been
sending
such
things
as
social
security
benefits
and
various
pensions
and
other
public
funds.
and,
more
interesting
since
zschernig,
the
state
of
oregon
has
held
its
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
california
is
--
and
the
reason
appellate
decision
on
october
9th
of
this
year
in
california
state
of
kramer
also
follows
there
and
he
held
that
by
reason
of
the
holding
in
zschernig
that
their
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and,
in
montana,
we
have
the
situation
in
ad
valorem
case,
there
was
up
before
this
court
and
decided
in
january
of
this
year
were
the
appropriate
court
found
that
in
view
of
zschernig
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
court
in
vorem
versus
fall
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
statute
cannot
be
applied
constitutionally.
and,
therefore,
did
not
follow
it
however,
the
attorney
general
disagreed
and
he
presently
have
filed
an
appeal
to
the
probate
court's
decision
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
montana.
now,
we
have
a
recent
decision
from
three-judge
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
eastern
division
which
to
my
knowledge
is
not
reported
where
an
identical
action
was
filed
challenging
the
iron
curtain
statute
of
ohio
by
a
certain
czechoslovakian
heirs.
and,
the
statute
in
ohio
is
substantially
identical
as
the
new
york
statute,
it's
a
custodial
statute
and
it
provides
that
the
heir
has
the
burden
to
prove
that
he
has
the
use
for
control
of
--
would
have
the
use
and
control
of
the
funds
or
that
special
circumstances
in
the
country
of
his
residence
would
not
prevent
him
from
using
and
enjoying
his
property
without
confiscation
or
hold
or
impart.
and,
i
think
that
my
position
would
reference
to
the
new
york
statute
is
very
well
said
out
by
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
ohio
case
of
maro
versus
batten.
they
may
are
all
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
no,
i
don't
believe
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
have
--
the
matter
was
unreported.
i
thought
it
would
be
reported
and
therefore
and
have
guessed
we
over
looked
it
and
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
decide
in
july
of
this
year
by
a
three-judge
court,
we
certainly
will
furnish
the
court
if
the
court's
question
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes,
as
far
as
i
know
yes
your
honor,
it's
unreported
and
it's
maro
versus
batten.
and,
in
that
--
they
have
the
same
problem,
the
same
action
challenging
the
constitutional.
i'm
asking
for
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
that
court
in
striking
down
and
following
zschernig
states
that
it
follows.
the
so-called
iron
curtain
statute
such
211381
and
that
is
the
ohio
statute
were
recently
considered
by
the
united
stated
supreme
court
in
zschernig
versus
miller
and
then
it
goes
on
to
elaborate
on
the
type
of
statue
of
oregon
have
the
three
provisions.
and
then
in
its
appeal
in
the
court
when
i
to
say
further
“in
passing
upon
the
validity
of
the
statute,”
the
supreme
court
consider
the
whole
area
of
reciprocal
inheritance
statutes.
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
reciprocal
inheritance
statutes
which
permits
the
state
court
only
to
re-construe
on
the
apply
laws
of
foreign
nation.
and,
those
which
permit
the
court
--
state
court
to
launch
enquiries
and
to
the
type
of
governments
that
obtain
in
a
particular
foreign
nation.
citing
its
earlier
decision
in
clark
versus
allen,
the
court
noted
that
state
courts
are
not
precluded
from
really
construing
and
applying
laws
of
a
foreign
nation.
the
court
held
however
that
where
statute
permits
inquiry
and
to
the
type
of
government
existing
in
a
foreign
nation.
or
into
the
operation
of
that
government
or
into
the
question
of
whether
the
legal
rights
guaranteed
by
the
nation
or
rights
in
fact
or
into
the
question
of
whether
statements
by
the
representatives
of
foreign
nations
are
credible
or
made
in
good
faith.
or
into
the
likelihood
that
the
legatees
will
actually
receive
the
property
left
to
them
such
statutes
so
applied
intrudes
into
the
exclusive
right
of
congress
to
regulate
foreign
policy.
section
211381,
ohio
revised
code
which
is
a
statute
that
issue
in
the
present
case
is
someone
different
from
the
oregon
statute
involved
in
zschernig.
in
ohio,
the
statute
requires
the
probate
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
foreign
legatee
will
have
to
been
further
use
or
control
of
the
money
left
him
because
of
circumstances
prevailing
at
that
the
place
of
residence
of
such
legatee.
the
ohio
statute
does
appear
to
be
directed
had
an
inquiry
into
the
operation
of
the
foreign
government
and
into
the
political
economic
and
social
conditions
prevailing
in
the
foreign
country.
this
type
of
inquiry
is
specifically
prohibited
by
the
doctrine
of
zschernig
versus
miller
and
we
say
that
that
exact
language
had
exact
argument
as
applicable
to
the
new
york
statute
here
under
review
because
this
statute
also
provides
that
if
there
is
a
special
circumstance
--
special
circumstances
that
the
points
of
residence
which
would
make
it
appear
that
the
party
would
have
not
have
the
money
then
the
court
could
withhold
the
funds.
now,
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
maro
versus
batten
issue
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
northern
district,
the
eastern
division.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes,
for
three-judge
court.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
maro
versus
batten.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes
your
honor.
it
was
decided
in
july
of
69,
but
since
so
far
as
i
know
and
as
i
have
been
asked,
naval
ascertain,
it's
unreported.
now,
in
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
i
think
this
court
in
the
majority
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
made
it
clear
that
the
fatality
of
the
infection
that's
involved
is
that
the
statute
is
freeing
in
such
a
manner
that
they
compels
the
court
to
go
into
internal
matters,
to
go
into
the
nature
of
the
government,
the
policy
of
the
government,
the
laws
of
the
government
and
the
laws
of
the
government
were
relations
to
their
citizens.
and
because
these
statutes
are
framed
in
such
a
way,
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
these
courts
are
intruding
into
an
area
that's
the
exclusive
domain
or
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
oh
yes
and
they
still
--
i
would
and
i
think
zschernig
makes
it
clear
that
they
still
have
a
right
to
applying
construe
and
this
maro
case
say
so.
but,
in
our
situation
they
are
not
applying
and
construing,
they
are
going
much
further.
the
way
the
statute
is
framed,
it's
even
difficult
to
determine
what
evidence
you
would
need
to
convince
a
court
that
they
have
to
use
benefit
from
all
the
cases
and
the
cases
are
repelled
what
example
or
you
bring
an
expert.
you
bring
an
expert
to
testify,
we
have
that
case
and
we
have
a
case
in
new
york
in
the
matter
of
dragonov
involving
bulgarian
areas.
and
they
brought
a
specialist
--
an
attorney
from
bulgaria
specializes
in
civil
family
law
and
in
inheritance
law
and
a
member
of
a
firm
in
sophia
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
were
reference
to
his
testimony.
the
court
cannot
disregard
the
fact
of
mr.
stephanof.
he
is
not
a
free
and
independent
attorney
and
an
impression
he
sought
to
create
as
a
member
of
a
lawyer's
collective
subject
to
the
restrictive
pressures
commonly
applied
in
iron
curtain
countries.
as
he
was
about
to
return
to
bulgaria,
he
cannot
be
expected
to
say
anything
interrogation
of
his
government
or
its
physical
policies.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
the
state
department
is
sometimes
on
both
sides
--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
not
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
no,
not
in
the
present
case.
there
is
--
where
there
is
a
letter
that
the
state
department
sent
to
governor
rockefeller
after
the
financial
agree
when
1960
requested
that
he
advice
the
new
york
authorities
that
the
federal
policy
now
permits
the
transfer
of
funds
to
romania
and
that
evidence
he
was
ignored
by
the
state
authority
to
probate
surrogate
judges.
and
at
the
same
time
which
we
have
letters
in
the
state
department
saying
that,
this
is
a
purely
a
matter
of
a
state
law
the
administration
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
we
--
i
know
that
they
have
not
filed
any
brief
here
as
amicus
through
in
any
capacity
whatsoever.
they
have
not
taken
any
official
position
insofar
as
i
am
aware
in
this
--
come
before
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
state
department
is
not
injecting
itself
for
directly.
perhaps,
i
think
there
has
been
some
letters
that
other
attorneys
and
i
think
it's
in
amicus
brief
that
they
shall
await
the
outcome
of
this
particular
problem
before
the
court
the
today.
but,
i
think
that
the
reading
of
zschernig,
i
think
that
the
reasonable
conclusion
be
drawn
from
that
that
new
york
connected
to
such
statute
because
it
dislikes
the
particular
governmental
systems
and
the
policies
of
these
countries.
and
that
was
the
new
york's
way
of
reacting
in
a
hostile
fashion
saying,
where
do
you
--
you
appropriate
properties
of
our
nationals
and
you
have
a
system
where
you
deny
your
citizens
the
right
to
private
property
and
because
of
that,
they
have
enacted
the
statute
to
react
to
say,
well,
if
you
do
all
those
things,
we're
going
to
withhold
funds
belonging
to
your
citizens.
and
this
type
of
conduct
is
the
one
that
causes
the
statute
to
invalid
because
this
is
not
a
function
of
the
state.
a
very
state
in
our
union
would
react
in
such
a
of
fashion
and
go
different
ways
on
a
purely
international
problem
we
have
chaos.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
think
congress
certain
to
federal
government
this
is
an
area
that
they
can
legislate
on
certainly
government
could've
congress
can
act
in
this
area
and
any
action
taken
by
the
federal
government
was
certainly
be
overwriting
and
the
certain
any
state
law
that
contravenes
it
would
have
to
fall.
i
think
that
in
our
situation
here
with
this
financial
agreement
i
think
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
gorum
case
and
which
was
joined
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
justice
fortas
he
said
that
federal
policy
permits
the
free
flow
of
funds
to
romania
which
is
true
and
that
no
state
judge,
they
make
or
apply
rule.
that
is
contrary
to
that
policy
which
is
true,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
the
problem
is
a
difficult
to
see
and
our
estimation
of
it
perhaps
we're
so
obsessed
and
studies
for
many
years.
but,
if
your
federal
government
does
one
thing
and
the
state
comes
and
says,
well
because
the
federal
government
for
awhile
was
permitting
funds.
and
there
are
still
countries
where
he
did
step
in
an
action
this
area
but
when
he
steps
in
the
area
made
a
determination
that
these
people
will
have
the
use
of
benefit.
there
is
a
reasonable
insurance
conditions
are
such
for
a
state
to
come
in
and
make
a
contrary
determination
to
that
made
by
the
federal
government
which
is
entrusted
with
these
matters
which
is
in
a
better
position
to
make
such
a
determination
and
new
york
has
said
this.
and
interestingly
enough
in
the
area
where
they
refuse
to
transmit
money,
they
were
allowed
federal
policy.
they
have
said
in
the
leading
case
prior
case
that
the
federal
government
in
the
better
position
to
know
what
the
situation
is
in
romania.
and
therefore
since
the
federal
government
does
not
permit
the
sending
of
fund,
we
can
rely
and
follow
that
policy
and
withhold
the
transcript
of
fund.
yet,
when
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
position
of
free
flow,
the
new
york
is
still
maintain
the
other
position
and
that
is
the
followed
federal
policy
that
would
satisfy
them
and
when
they
like
federal
policy,
when
they
didn't
like
federal
policy
they
refuse
to
go
on.
and
i
think
that
is
the
problem
here,
there's
no
question
about
it
and
the
states
who
seen
it
except
new
york.
all
of
the
authorities
have
seen
it
and
there
are
many
states
which
would
not
in
that
such
a
law.
illinois
refused
governor
kerner
refused
to
approve
such
a
law
difficult
all
because
he
says
“we're
getting
in
to
an
area
that
will
exceed
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
state
and
we
should
enact
in
such
an
area
and
let
the
federal
government
act
in
such
an
area.”
and
therefore,
i
say,
that
the
decision
below
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
constitutional
conclusion
of
this
court
in
zschernig
and
should
be
reversed
and
these
people
are
dire
need
of
their
money.
many
of
them
have
passed
away
and
many
amounts
are
very
modest
should
have
their
money
at
the
earliest
possible
moment.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
think
that
that
may
and
they
treat
everyone
equally
without
discriminating
with
aliens.
it's
traditionally,
the
authority
of
a
state
in
that
area
to
perhaps
eliminate
but
i
think
they
have
to
do
on
a
constitutional
fashion.
and
they
--
it
was
in
the
confines
of
their
traditional
probate
authority
without
exceeding
is
they
have
here
and
what
i'm
trying
to
make
foreign
policy
as
new
york
is
in
our
opinion
and
thank
you
very
much.
