mr.
vintilla,
in
all
modesty
you
can't
really
rely
on
a
concurring
opinion,
is
that
what's
the
court
opinion
said
presumably
there
would
not
been
a
necessity
for
a
concurring
opinion
to
say
something?
well,
that
is
true
but
we
believe
that
the
majority
opinion
not
so
succinctly,
not
so
directly
this
is
said
about
the
same
thing
that
these
courts
are
injected
into
this
area
whether
because
to
make
these
inquiries
and
to
make
inquiries
based
consideration
which
are
political
in
nature
and
which
are
involves,
which
are
on
an
area
that's
involved
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations.
and
because
of
that,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice

was
in
error
in
failing
and
refusing
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
--
justice

stewart
at
the
behest
to
the
plaintiff,
that's
it?
justice

that's
a
