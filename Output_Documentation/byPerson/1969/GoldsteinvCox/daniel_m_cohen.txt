mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
is
before
the
court
after
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
appellants.
matter
is
before
the
three-judge
court
solely
upon
the
basis
of
affidavits.
the
attorney
general
was
prepared
in
connection
with
this
case
to
go
ahead
with
a
trial
of
issue
that
have
been
presented
by
the
pleadings
here
in
order
to
have
determine
the
issue
which
is
presented
by
these
plaintiffs
of
whether
the
new
york
statute
which
has
under
prior
decisions
been
held
to
be
valid
on
its
face.
determine
have
a
three-judge
court
determine
whether
the
statute
was
being
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
now,
this
court
had
before
a
similar
appeal
from
the
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
gloren
against
follo,
and
the
court
as
i
see
it
pretty
much
unanimously
decided
in
that
case
that
the
summary
judgment
motion
on
appeal
from
the
montana
district
court
have
been
properly
denied.
there
was
a
dissent
in
gloren
which
was
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
in
gloren,
the
district
court
had
completely
dismissed
the
complaint
which
have
been
filed
in
that
case
in
montana.
and
the
dissent
was
based
upon
the
theory
that
this
court
whatever
its
prior
decisions
for
the
relation
to
abstention
should
have
directed
the
montana
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
case
to
see
what
the
state
court
would
do
where
a
relation
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
zschernig
case.
now,
in
the
instant
case
the
attorney
general
has
never
moot
to
dismiss
the
complaint
in
this
action.
despite
the
provisions
of
section
2283,
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
proceedings
pending
that
were
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
before
the
surrogate's
court,
before
the
various
surrogates
that
are
named
as
defendants
in
this
case,
despite
that
there
are
actual
pending
state
court
proceedings
which
the
complaint
seeks
to
enjoin
and
despite
the
fact
that
as
i
pointed
out
to
this
court
in
the
ianu
case
which
was
before
this
court
several
years
ago
that
the
doors
of
the
surrogate's
court
are
constantly
open
to
the
making
of
any
application
to
withdraw
these
funds
so
that
instead
of
coming
into
the
federal
courts
through
the
district
court
through
the
three-judge
court
not
to
the
supreme
court.
these
romanian
heirs
are
still
in
the
position
where
they
can
go
to
the
surrogate's
court
in
new
york
and
to
apply
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
funds
that
have
been
withheld.
now,
in
the
ianu
case
where
the
matter
came
before
this
court
after
the
decision
in
zschernig,
a
dissent
was
written
by
justice
douglas
saying,
we
should
--
this
court
should
not
compel
the
applicant
to
go
all
the
way
down
that
the
surrogate's
court
and
come
back
up
here
again.
in
ianu,
an
application
was
made
to
the
surrogate
for
the
withdrawal
of
funds
and
the
application
which
was
made
in
that
case
by
an
assignee
of
a
none
resident
alien
was
approved
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
assignee
and
other
claimant
who
have
a
power
of
attorney
from
the
none
resident
alien
beneficiary.
the
surrogate
determined
the
dispute
between
the
two
conflicting
claims
and
directed
payment
to
ianu
in
the
america
state,
ianu
getting
of
the
amount
which
was
on
deposit
with
the
new
york
surrogate.
now
to
a
certain
extent,
the
appellants
here
are
pretty
much
beating
a
dead
horse,
because
the
talking
about
a
situation
to
a
certain
extent
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
complaint
was
filed
in
those
actions.
they
disregarded
all
of
the
things
that
have
occurred
in
the
surrogate's
courts
in
new
york.
since
that
time,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
with
relation
to
claims
by
romanian
none
resident
aliens,
all
of
the
judges
within
the
limits
of
the
city
of
new
york
who
were
designated
as
defendants
in
this
suit.
surrogates
within
that
area
have
been
transmitting
funds
to
none
resident
aliens.
the
amounts
that
have
been
involved
in
these
states
are
varied
in
$5000.00
to
$35,000.00,
this
is
my
up-to-date
information
and
these
funds
have
been
directed
to
be
transmitted
by
the
surrogates
and
mr.
vintilla
if
he
goes
into
the
surrogate's
court
at
this
particular
point,
i
think
we'll
have
no
real
difficulty
if
he
is
able
to
supply
sufficient
prove
to
the
surrogates
with
relation
of
the
validity
of
his
claims.
the
attorney
general
as
i
stated
was
prepared
in
connection
with
this
matter
before
the
three-judge
court
to
indicate
that
even
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
a
year
ago.
in
a
substantial
portion
of
the
cases
that
were
coming
before
the
new
york
surrogates
direction
were
being
made
to
transmit
funds
are
condition
in
some
cases
with
relations
of
some
of
the
countries
that
the
amounts
be
limited
with
relation
to
say
poland
to
$5000.00
and
two
check
certificates
with
relation
to
russia
that
the
amounts
that
were
transmissible
should
not
exceed
the
sum
of
$10,000.00
to
any
beneficiary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
lycan
case
which
was
decided
just
a
few
days
before
the
argument,
before
the
three-judge
court,
held
that
the
new
york
statute
was
a
statute
which
was
capable
of
being
enforced
without
animate
versions
with
relation
to
the
fund,
to
the
governments
of
foreign
countries.
the
district
court
here
has
indicated
clearly
that
they
find
that
this
record
is
inadequate
to
justify
this
court
in
holding
summarily
that
section
2218
is
unconstitutional
upon
the
zschernig
rule.
without
any
evidence
and
this
was
the
situation
before
the
district
court,
mr.
vintilla
was
given
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
he
did
not.
without
any
evidence
whatever
is
to
how
section
2218
has
been
applied
in
this
case,
we
are
unable
to
say
that
it
has
been
applied
in
such
a
way
as
to
interfere
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
we
interrupt
the
supreme
court's
recent
ruling
denying
a
rehearing
in
ianu
as
at
least
that
indication
that
evidence
of
improper
application
of
that
statute
is
necessary.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
this
--
this
is
an
attempt
to
set
up
a
representative
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
various
romanian
beneficiaries
and
they
are
all
fairly
small
estates.
as
i
understand
that
are
represented
by
these
particular
plaintiffs
and
the
actual
disposition
that
would
be
made
with
relation
to
a
claimant,
they
went
back
into
the
surrogate's
court
would
undoubtedly
at
this
particular
state
is
be
favorable.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
complaint
alleged
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
complaint
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
stating
that
the
plaintiffs
were
nationals
of
romania
and
specify
that
certain
particular
surrogates
--
there
are
62
counties
in
the
new
york
state.
and
these
are
surrogates
just
in
poor
of
the
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york
stated
that
this
surrogates
were
withholding
moneys
of
these
beneficiaries
--
these
romanian
nationals
who
were
resident
in
the
romania.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it
named
certain
specified
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
--
yes,
there
are
lawsuits
pending
to
the
extent
that
there
are
claims
that
have
been
filed
with
surrogates
in
bronx
county
in
new
york
county,
queen's
county
and
king's
county
where
funds
have
been
withheld
where
they
can
still
go
back
into
these
various
surrogates
--
before
these
various
surrogates.
actually,
two
of
the
surrogates
that
are
named
here
are
no
longer
serving
in
the
particular
offices
which
they
held
at
the
time
by
reason
of
the
exploration
of
their
terms.
the
successors
are
paying
out
moneys
and
not
only
to
the
applicants
from
these
countries,
but
i
understand
that
one
of
them
abused
the
zschernig
decision
as
the
sufficient
warrant
to
pay
the
pay
moneys
to
certain
of
the
countries
which
has
to
which
fund
is
oblige.
mr.
daniel

red
china.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
relief
that
was
asked
before
here
was
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
against
the
surrogates
in
forcing
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
was
then
section
269-(a)
of
the

act
and
now
as
section
2218
of
the
surrogates
court
procedure
act.
mr.
daniel
m.

some
of
the
surrogates
are
ordering
the
money
to
be
paid
and
some
of

and
then
the

been

the
money
is
not
only
to
people
who
were
like
those
represented
here,
but
also
paying

is
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
with
relation
to
the
constitutionality,
but
in
the
meantime,
he
is
paying
the
amounts
out
in
to
romanian
representatives
in
small
amounts.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
attorney
general
is
not
familiar
with
the
decision
which
was
called
your
attention
by
mr.
vintilla
and
his
argument.
but,
i
have
called
his
attention,
a
law
review
article
which
is
about
to
be
published
in
my
baylor
university,
school
of
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
i
--
shortly
after
i
completed
my
brief
and
had
at
file
for
this
court,
i
received
a
copy
of
the
letter
from
an
assistant
professor
marian
a.
farwell
at
stetson
university
college
of
law
indicating
that
he
had
or
become
familiar
with
this
case
and
have
a
strong
interest
in
the
final
outcome
thereof.
and
had
prepared
an
llm
thesis
for
his
studies
at
george
washington
university
law
school.
now,
he
sent
me
a
copy
in
xerox
form
which
i
have
duplicated
and
which
i
have
left
with
a
clerk
so
that
it
will
available
for
the
court
counsel
for
the
appellants
has
received
a
copy
of
it.
and
i
would
like
to
just
read
a
few
sentences
from
the
letter
of
transmission
from
professor
farwell.
i
corresponded
with
counsel
in
most
of
the
major
cases
decided
prior
to
your
case,
the
subject
of
the
thesis
is
state
probate
laws
alien
heirs
the
zschernig
legacy.
i
corresponded
with
counsel
and
most
of
the
major
cases
decided
prior
to
your
case
including
mr.
vintilla
with
other
law
professors
concerned
with
the
problem
and
was
able
to
get
some
information
from
the
various
agencies
involved
when
there
was
in
washington.
these
research
in
my
opinion
has
turned
up
some
interesting
question
about
zschernig
against
miller
its
firm
applications
and
which
to
the
best
my
knowledge
have
not
been
considered
by
the
court
of
any
of
the
accommodations
who
have
commented
on
the
problem.
it's
my
hope
the
court
will
not
extend
zschernig
to
the
point
where
there
will
be
required
to
hold
the
new
york's
statute
and
similar
ones
to
be
unconstitutional
per
se.
i
have
the
taken
the
liberty
of
volunteering
this
thesis
in
a
hope
that
you
may
find
that
to
some
use
in
the
goldstein
case.
my
interest
in
the
case
is
string
and
i
am
hopeful
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision.
so
have
an
--
i
wish
you
success
etcetera.
the
reasons
as
i
particularly
want
to
have
this
thesis
by
a
law
professor
before
you
is
that
in
fact
most
of
the
testimony
that
has
been
adduced
in
various
proceedings
in
the
new
york
surrogates
court
and
recent
years
has
not
been
ambassadors
or
representatives
of
foreign
government.
but,
the
testimony
has
been
there
of
a
professor
meyer
of
harvard
law
school
who
has
been
testifying
on
the
basis
of
the
fee
of
$500
per
day
for
testimony
to
show
that
in
these
various
iron
curtain
countries.
the
persons
who
were
named
as
beneficiaries
will
actually
receive
the
used
benefit
in
control
of
the
legacies
which
are
involved.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
statute
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs
have
stated
that
to
be.
the
statute
used
benefit
control
to
something
design
to
see
to
what
the
persons
who
were
named
and
will
persons
who
have
a
natural
objects
of
bounty
who
would
get
distributives
shares
under
the
new
york
distributions
statute
will
actually
receive
their
legacies
or
the
distributive
shares.
the
statute
on
its
face
contains
no
language,
which
might
be
considered
any
sort
of
animate
version.
i
think
that
the
thesis
which
is
submitted
by
professor
farwell
will
indicate
probably
a
response
to
the
chief
judge's
question.
many
statutes
which
deal
which
deal
with
problems
of
foreign
law
or
raggedly
treated
by
our
courts,
that
they're
treated
in
a
way
which
does
not
require
any
eminent
version,
doesn't
require
any
interference
with
foreign
relations.
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
sort
of
case
to
bring
in
a
foreign
consul
and
to
place
him
in
a
disparaging
position.
we
were
prepared
to
show
that
even
before
the
decision
in
the
zschernig
case,
that
various
surrogates
throughout
the
state
had
upon
appropriate
testimony
directed
distribution
of
shares
where
the
records
in
the
cases
before
them
warranted
such
disposition.
in
my
1967
brief
before
this
court
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert
which
was
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
here.
i
cited
the
sidla
case.
in
that
case,
money
had
been
withheld
amend
despite
my
argument
in
the
third
department
for
the
situation
does
not
the
third
department
of
new
york
court
system
that
the
testimony
was
still
substantially
of
the
same
was
have
been
originally
at
use
before
the
surrogate.
the
appellate
division
and
the
third
department
directed
transmission.
the
moneys
involved
there
where
hungarian
moneys,
but
the
situation
has
no
different
from
that
involved
in
this
romanian
case.
now,
we
believe
that
new
york
just
like
in
other
litigant
before
this
court
is
entitled
to
due
process.
reversal
of
this
decision
would
place
new
york
where
in
a
situation
where
it
had
not
actually
been
granted
the
hearing
as
to
how
its
statute
was
being
administered.
with
relation
to
remarks
that
are
made
by
or
have
been
made
by
certain
of
the
surrogates
or
to
have
--
are
alleged
to
have
been
made
by
the
surrogates
that
might
have
been
disparaging.
i
might
say
this,
this
court
has
sustained
to
also
of
other
attempts
at
the
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
press.
it
seems
to
me
that
surrogates
of
our
courts
if
they
go
beyond
their
duties
in
no
worst
position
then
individuals
who
seek
to
state
their
own
opinions
with
relation
to
matters
that
may
affect
public
policy.
however,
the
statute
which
you
have
is
a
statute
which
deals
with
the
transmission
of
private
funds.
it
does
not
in
anyway
contradict
the
state
department
arrangements
with
romania
which
deal
simply
with
the
transmission
of
public
funds.
in
answer
of
the
question
that
was
addressed
to
appellant's
counsel
as
to
whether
there
has
been
any
state
department
expression.
i
have
a
next
essay
and
appendix
to
my
brief,
a
letter
which
was
written
to
counsel
for
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
which
states
that
since
the
administration
of
a
state
is
not
a
federal
function.
the
remittance
of
inheritances
to
far
and
beneficiaries
including
those
in
the
soviet
union,
that
was
the
country
as
to
which
the
question
was
addressed
does
not
normally
come
to
the
attention
of
this
department.
the
department
of
state
is
therefore
not
make
position
to
know
or
to
make
judgment
on
the
basis
for
the
small
member
of
cases
that
which
the
department
has
become
aware
in
which
soviet
as
i
believe
to
receive
benefit
from
the
remittances
of
the
state
shares
where
the
funds
sent
to
persons
resident.
in
the
soviet
union
from
the
united
states
are
generally
received
by
them
and
fully
available
and
then
for
use
in
benefit.
this
letter
was
dated
june
1968.
now,
the
attorney
general
respectfully
submits
upon
the
record
in
this
case
dealing
solely
with
the
question
of
whether
summary
judgment
should've
been
granted
or
denied
that
summary
judgment
was
properly
denied.
and
that
this
court
need
not
at
this
time
pass
upon
the
question
is
to
what
would
happen
if
the
federal
government
through
its
congress
determine
to
pass
a
law
which
prohibited
this
type
of
state's
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
you
know
in
narrow
issue
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
pass
upon
any
other
question
at
this
stage
of
this
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prior
decisions
in
this
case
including
the
remission
of
this
case
to
the
district
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor,
you're
right
about
that.
i
would
again
need
that
file.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
as
the
opinion
was
written
in
zschernig
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
indicated
that
when
clock
against
allen
as
before
this
court
--
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court
in
clock
against
allen
just
whether
the
statute
that
involved
in
that
case
was
a
statute
with
one
valid
on
its
face
and
it
didn't
have
before
the
question
of
application
of
that
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
the
opinion
is
written,
the
opinion
rests
primarily
with
relation
to
the
misapplication
of
the
statute
upon
various
law
review
articles
which
indicate
such
misapplication.
now,
that
those
law
review
articles
including
the
one
which
was
written
by
mr.
meyer
are
not
the
product
of
our
judicial
system
where
you
get
into
court
and
try
a
case
and
where
you
find
out
what
actually
happened.
the
man
who
wrote
--
i
said
meyer,
i
meant
mr.
berman.
the
berman
articles
are
written
by
somebody
who
has
been
testifying
at
the
rate
of
$500
per
day
as
an
expert
witness
to
sustain
that
position
that
has
been
put
for
in
these
various
cases
by
iron
curtain
claimants.
now,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
opportunity
not
only
to
test
mr.
berman's
testimony
upon
a
trial
but
possibly
has
followed
a
job
as
mr.
justice
douglas
did
in
analyzing
the
law
review
articles
at
that
time
that
perhaps
mr.
justice
harlan
did
his
homework
better.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
is
before
the
court
after
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
appellants.
matter
is
before
the
three-judge
court
solely
upon
the
basis
of
affidavits.
the
attorney
general
was
prepared
in
connection
with
this
case
to
go
ahead
with
a
trial
of
issue
that
have
been
presented
by
the
pleadings
here
in
order
to
have
determine
the
issue
which
is
presented
by
these
plaintiffs
of
whether
the
new
york
statute
which
has
under
prior
decisions
been
held
to
be
valid
on
its
face.
determine
have
a
three-judge
court
determine
whether
the
statute
was
being
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
now,
this
court
had
before
a
similar
appeal
from
the
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
gloren
against
follo,
and
the
court
as
i
see
it
pretty
much
unanimously
decided
in
that
case
that
the
summary
judgment
motion
on
appeal
from
the
montana
district
court
have
been
properly
denied.
there
was
a
dissent
in
gloren
which
was
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
in
gloren,
the
district
court
had
completely
dismissed
the
complaint
which
have
been
filed
in
that
case
in
montana.
and
the
dissent
was
based
upon
the
theory
that
this
court
whatever
its
prior
decisions
for
the
relation
to
abstention
should
have
directed
the
montana
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
case
to
see
what
the
state
court
would
do
where
a
relation
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
zschernig
case.
now,
in
the
instant
case
the
attorney
general
has
never
moot
to
dismiss
the
complaint
in
this
action.
despite
the
provisions
of
section
2283,
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
proceedings
pending
that
were
referred
to
in
the
complaint.
before
the
surrogate's
court,
before
the
various
surrogates
that
are
named
as
defendants
in
this
case,
despite
that
there
are
actual
pending
state
court
proceedings
which
the
complaint
seeks
to
enjoin
and
despite
the
fact
that
as
i
pointed
out
to
this
court
in
the
ianu
case
which
was
before
this
court
several
years
ago
that
the
doors
of
the
surrogate's
court
are
constantly
open
to
the
making
of
any
application
to
withdraw
these
funds
so
that
instead
of
coming
into
the
federal
courts
through
the
district
court
through
the
three-judge
court
not
to
the
supreme
court.
these
romanian
heirs
are
still
in
the
position
where
they
can
go
to
the
surrogate's
court
in
new
york
and
to
apply
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
funds
that
have
been
withheld.
now,
in
the
ianu
case
where
the
matter
came
before
this
court
after
the
decision
in
zschernig,
a
dissent
was
written
by
justice
douglas
saying,
we
should
--
this
court
should
not
compel
the
applicant
to
go
all
the
way
down
that
the
surrogate's
court
and
come
back
up
here
again.
in
ianu,
an
application
was
made
to
the
surrogate
for
the
withdrawal
of
funds
and
the
application
which
was
made
in
that
case
by
an
assignee
of
a
none
resident
alien
was
approved
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
assignee
and
other
claimant
who
have
a
power
of
attorney
from
the
none
resident
alien
beneficiary.
the
surrogate
determined
the
dispute
between
the
two
conflicting
claims
and
directed
payment
to
ianu
in
the
america
state,
ianu
getting
of
the
amount
which
was
on
deposit
with
the
new
york
surrogate.
now
to
a
certain
extent,
the
appellants
here
are
pretty
much
beating
a
dead
horse,
because
the
talking
about
a
situation
to
a
certain
extent
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
complaint
was
filed
in
those
actions.
they
disregarded
all
of
the
things
that
have
occurred
in
the
surrogate's
courts
in
new
york.
since
that
time,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
with
relation
to
claims
by
romanian
none
resident
aliens,
all
of
the
judges
within
the
limits
of
the
city
of
new
york
who
were
designated
as
defendants
in
this
suit.
surrogates
within
that
area
have
been
transmitting
funds
to
none
resident
aliens.
the
amounts
that
have
been
involved
in
these
states
are
varied
in
$5000.00
to
$35,000.00,
this
is
my
up-to-date
information
and
these
funds
have
been
directed
to
be
transmitted
by
the
surrogates
and
mr.
vintilla
if
he
goes
into
the
surrogate's
court
at
this
particular
point,
i
think
we'll
have
no
real
difficulty
if
he
is
able
to
supply
sufficient
prove
to
the
surrogates
with
relation
of
the
validity
of
his
claims.
the
attorney
general
as
i
stated
was
prepared
in
connection
with
this
matter
before
the
three-judge
court
to
indicate
that
even
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
a
year
ago.
in
a
substantial
portion
of
the
cases
that
were
coming
before
the
new
york
surrogates
direction
were
being
made
to
transmit
funds
are
condition
in
some
cases
with
relations
of
some
of
the
countries
that
the
amounts
be
limited
with
relation
to
say
poland
to
$5000.00
and
two
check
certificates
with
relation
to
russia
that
the
amounts
that
were
transmissible
should
not
exceed
the
sum
of
$10,000.00
to
any
beneficiary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
lycan
case
which
was
decided
just
a
few
days
before
the
argument,
before
the
three-judge
court,
held
that
the
new
york
statute
was
a
statute
which
was
capable
of
being
enforced
without
animate
versions
with
relation
to
the
fund,
to
the
governments
of
foreign
countries.
the
district
court
here
has
indicated
clearly
that
they
find
that
this
record
is
inadequate
to
justify
this
court
in
holding
summarily
that
section
2218
is
unconstitutional
upon
the
zschernig
rule.
without
any
evidence
and
this
was
the
situation
before
the
district
court,
mr.
vintilla
was
given
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
he
did
not.
without
any
evidence
whatever
is
to
how
section
2218
has
been
applied
in
this
case,
we
are
unable
to
say
that
it
has
been
applied
in
such
a
way
as
to
interfere
with
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
we
interrupt
the
supreme
court's
recent
ruling
denying
a
rehearing
in
ianu
as
at
least
that
indication
that
evidence
of
improper
application
of
that
statute
is
necessary.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
this
--
this
is
an
attempt
to
set
up
a
representative
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
various
romanian
beneficiaries
and
they
are
all
fairly
small
estates.
as
i
understand
that
are
represented
by
these
particular
plaintiffs
and
the
actual
disposition
that
would
be
made
with
relation
to
a
claimant,
they
went
back
into
the
surrogate's
court
would
undoubtedly
at
this
particular
state
is
be
favorable.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
complaint
alleged
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
complaint
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
stating
that
the
plaintiffs
were
nationals
of
romania
and
specify
that
certain
particular
surrogates
--
there
are
62
counties
in
the
new
york
state.
and
these
are
surrogates
just
in
poor
of
the
counties
in
the
state
of
new
york
stated
that
this
surrogates
were
withholding
moneys
of
these
beneficiaries
--
these
romanian
nationals
who
were
resident
in
the
romania.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it
named
certain
specified
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
--
yes,
there
are
lawsuits
pending
to
the
extent
that
there
are
claims
that
have
been
filed
with
surrogates
in
bronx
county
in
new
york
county,
queen's
county
and
king's
county
where
funds
have
been
withheld
where
they
can
still
go
back
into
these
various
surrogates
--
before
these
various
surrogates.
actually,
two
of
the
surrogates
that
are
named
here
are
no
longer
serving
in
the
particular
offices
which
they
held
at
the
time
by
reason
of
the
exploration
of
their
terms.
the
successors
are
paying
out
moneys
and
not
only
to
the
applicants
from
these
countries,
but
i
understand
that
one
of
them
abused
the
zschernig
decision
as
the
sufficient
warrant
to
pay
the
pay
moneys
to
certain
of
the
countries
which
has
to
which
fund
is
oblige.
mr.

mr.
daniel

the
relief
that
was
asked
before
here
was
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
against
the
surrogates
in
forcing
the

of

of

which
was

of

out
in
to

in
small
amounts.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
attorney
general
is
not
familiar
with
the
decision
which
was
called
your
attention
by
mr.
vintilla
and
his
argument.
but,
i
have
called
his
attention,
a
law
review
article
which
is
about
to
be
published
in
my
baylor
university,
school
of
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
i
--
shortly
after
i
completed
my
brief
and
had
at
file
for
this
court,
i
received
a
copy
of
the
letter
from
an
assistant
professor
marian
a.
farwell
at
stetson
university
college
of
law
indicating
that
he
had
or
become
familiar
with
this
case
and
have
a
strong
interest
in
the
final
outcome
thereof.
and
had
prepared
an
llm
thesis
for
his
studies
at
george
washington
university
law
school.
now,
he
sent
me
a
copy
in
xerox
form
which
i
have
duplicated
and
which
i
have
left
with
a
clerk
so
that
it
will
available
for
the
court
counsel
for
the
appellants
has
received
a
copy
of
it.
and
i
would
like
to
just
read
a
few
sentences
from
the
letter
of
transmission
from
professor
farwell.
i
corresponded
with
counsel
in
most
of
the
major
cases
decided
prior
to
your
case,
the
subject
of
the
thesis
is
state
probate
laws
alien
heirs
the
zschernig
legacy.
i
corresponded
with
counsel
and
most
of
the
major
cases
decided
prior
to
your
case
including
mr.
vintilla
with
other
law
professors
concerned
with
the
problem
and
was
able
to
get
some
information
from
the
various
agencies
involved
when
there
was
in
washington.
these
research
in
my
opinion
has
turned
up
some
interesting
question
about
zschernig
against
miller
its
firm
applications
and
which
to
the
best
my
knowledge
have
not
been
considered
by
the
court
of
any
of
the
accommodations
who
have
commented
on
the
problem.
it's
my
hope
the
court
will
not
extend
zschernig
to
the
point
where
there
will
be
required
to
hold
the
new
york's
statute
and
similar
ones
to
be
unconstitutional
per
se.
i
have
the
taken
the
liberty
of
volunteering
this
thesis
in
a
hope
that
you
may
find
that
to
some
use
in
the
goldstein
case.
my
interest
in
the
case
is
string
and
i
am
hopeful
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision.
so
have
an
--
i
wish
you
success
etcetera.
the
reasons
as
i
particularly
want
to
have
this
thesis
by
a
law
professor
before
you
is
that
in
fact
most
of
the
testimony
that
has
been
adduced
in
various
proceedings
in
the
new
york
surrogates
court
and
recent
years
has
not
been
ambassadors
or
representatives
of
foreign
government.
but,
the
testimony
has
been
there
of
a
professor
meyer
of
harvard
law
school
who
has
been
testifying
on
the
basis
of
the
fee
of
$500
per
day
for
testimony
to
show
that
in
these
various
iron
curtain
countries.
the
persons
who
were
named
as
beneficiaries
will
actually
receive
the
used
benefit
in
control
of
the
legacies
which
are
involved.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
statute
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs
have
stated
that
to
be.
the
statute
used
benefit
control
to
something
design
to
see
to
what
the
persons
who
were
named
and
will
persons
who
have
a
natural
objects
of
bounty
who
would
get
distributives
shares
under
the
new
york
distributions
statute
will
actually
receive
their
legacies
or
the
distributive
shares.
the
statute
on
its
face
contains
no
language,
which
might
be
considered
any
sort
of
animate
version.
i
think
that
the
thesis
which
is
submitted
by
professor
farwell
will
indicate
probably
a
response
to
the
chief
judge's
question.
many
statutes
which
deal
which
deal
with
problems
of
foreign
law
or
raggedly
treated
by
our
courts,
that
they're
treated
in
a
way
which
does
not
require
any
eminent
version,
doesn't
require
any
interference
with
foreign
relations.
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
sort
of
case
to
bring
in
a
foreign
consul
and
to
place
him
in
a
disparaging
position.
we
were
prepared
to
show
that
even
before
the
decision
in
the
zschernig
case,
that
various
surrogates
throughout
the
state
had
upon
appropriate
testimony
directed
distribution
of
shares
where
the
records
in
the
cases
before
them
warranted
such
disposition.
in
my
1967
brief
before
this
court
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert
which
was
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
here.
i
cited
the
sidla
case.
in
that
case,
money
had
been
withheld
amend
despite
my
argument
in
the
third
department
for
the
situation
does
not
the
third
department
of
new
york
court
system
that
the
testimony
was
still
substantially
of
the
same
was
have
been
originally
at
use
before
the
surrogate.
the
appellate
division
and
the
third
department
directed
transmission.
the
moneys
involved
there
where
hungarian
moneys,
but
the
situation
has
no
different
from
that
involved
in
this
romanian
case.
now,
we
believe
that
new
york
just
like
in
other
litigant
before
this
court
is
entitled
to
due
process.
reversal
of
this
decision
would
place
new
york
where
in
a
situation
where
it
had
not
actually
been
granted
the
hearing
as
to
how
its
statute
was
being
administered.
with
relation
to
remarks
that
are
made
by
or
have
been
made
by
certain
of
the
surrogates
or
to
have
--
are
alleged
to
have
been
made
by
the
surrogates
that
might
have
been
disparaging.
i
might
say
this,
this
court
has
sustained
to
also
of
other
attempts
at
the
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
press.
it
seems
to
me
that
surrogates
of
our
courts
if
they
go
beyond
their
duties
in
no
worst
position
then
individuals
who
seek
to
state
their
own
opinions
with
relation
to
matters
that
may
affect
public
policy.
however,
the
statute
which
you
have
is
a
statute
which
deals
with
the
transmission
of
private
funds.
it
does
not
in
anyway
contradict
the
state
department
arrangements
with
romania
which
deal
simply
with
the
transmission
of
public
funds.
in
answer
of
the
question
that
was
addressed
to
appellant's
counsel
as
to
whether
there
has
been
any
state
department
expression.
i
have
a
next
essay
and
appendix
to
my
brief,
a
letter
which
was
written
to
counsel
for
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
which
states
that
since
the
administration
of
a
state
is
not
a
federal
function.
the
remittance
of
inheritances
to
far
and
beneficiaries
including
those
in
the
soviet
union,
that
was
the
country
as
to
which
the
question
was
addressed
does
not
normally
come
to
the
attention
of
this
department.
the
department
of
state
is
therefore
not
make
position
to
know
or
to
make
judgment
on
the
basis
for
the
small
member
of
cases
that
which
the
department
has
become
aware
in
which
soviet
as
i
believe
to
receive
benefit
from
the
remittances
of
the
state
shares
where
the
funds
sent
to
persons
resident.
in
the
soviet
union
from
the
united
states
are
generally
received
by
them
and
fully
available
and
then
for
use
in
benefit.
this
letter
was
dated
june
1968.
now,
the
attorney
general
respectfully
submits
upon
the
record
in
this
case
dealing
solely
with
the
question
of
whether
summary
judgment
should've
been
granted
or
denied
that
summary
judgment
was
properly
denied.
and
that
this
court
need
not
at
this
time
pass
upon
the
question
is
to
what
would
happen
if
the
federal
government
through
its
congress
determine
to
pass
a
law
which
prohibited
this
type
of
state's
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
you
know
in
narrow
issue
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
pass
upon
any
other
question
at
this
stage
of
this
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prior
decisions
in
this
case
including
the
remission
of
this
case
to
the
district
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor,
you're
right
about
that.
i
would
again
need
that
file.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
as
the
opinion
was
written
in
zschernig
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
indicated
that
when
clock
against
allen
as
before
this
court
--
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court
in
clock
against
allen
just
whether
the
statute
that
involved
in
that
case
was
a
statute
with
one
valid
on
its
face
and
it
didn't
have
before
the
question
of
application
of
that
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
the
opinion
is
written,
the
opinion
rests
primarily
with
relation
to
the
misapplication
of
the
statute
upon
various
law
review
articles
which
indicate
such
misapplication.
now,
that
those
law
review
articles
including
the
one
which
was
written
by
mr.
meyer
are
not
the
product
of
our
judicial
system
where
you
get
into
court
and
try
a
case
and
where
you
find
out
what
actually
happened.
the
man
who
wrote
--
i
said
meyer,
i
meant
mr.
berman.
the
berman
articles
are
written
by
somebody
who
has
been
testifying
at
the
rate
of
$500
per
day
as
an
expert
witness
to
sustain
that
position
that
has
been
put
for
in
these
various
cases
by
iron
curtain
claimants.
now,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
opportunity
not
only
to
test
mr.
berman's
testimony
upon
a
trial
but
possibly
has
followed
a
job
as
mr.
justice
douglas
did
in
analyzing
the
law
review
articles
at
that
time
that
perhaps
mr.
justice
harlan
did
his
homework
better.
