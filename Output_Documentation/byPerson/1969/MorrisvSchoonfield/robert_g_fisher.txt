mr.
robert
g.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
fisher.
i
represent
a
class
of
plaintiff
appellants.
the
class
is
defined
as
those
people
who
are
incarcerated
in
the
baltimore
city
jail
and
we
have
defined
it
as
a
continuing
class.
we
brought
this
action
in
july
1968
and
there
are
currently
about
a
150
people
in
the
baltimore
city
jail
under
the
statute
that
we
are
attacking.
this
case
is
different
from
the
williams
case
that
the
court
has
just
heard,
in
that
there,
only
i
--
and
unusual
application
of
the
jail
or
fine
statute
was
being
contested.
the
situation
where
the
judge
gives
both
the
maximum
jail
sentence
and
a
fine,
and
the
person
is
required
to
serve
more
than
the
maximum
amount
allowed.
our
case
covers
all
types
of
incarceration
for
non-payment
of
fines
except
the
contumacious
refusal
to
pay
situation.
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
our
case
involves
a
two-dollar
rate
instead
of
a
five-dollar
rate.
it
is
a
mandatory
rate
as
the
statute
says
the
judge
shall
commit
him
and
then
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
statute,
then
the
statute
provides
a
two-dollar
rate.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
$2.00
per
day.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right
your
honor.
the
new
statute
should
be
enforced,
but
it
is
not.
i
called
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
of
baltimore
city
yesterday,
and
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
new
statute.
he
asked
me
to
send
him
a
copy
which
i
did.
i
called
the
jail
and
they
said
they
had
not
heard
of
the
new
statute
and
that
nobody
was
getting
out
under
it.
the
new
statute
by
the
way
just
gives
a
judicial
remedy.
it
does
not
say
that
everybody
who's
committed
under
the
old
statute
should
get
out,
and
only
gives
them
a
right
to
apply
to
the
justice
that
committed
them
for
re-determination
under
the
new
statute
and
it
does
not
guarantee
that
we
--
they
will
get
out.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
has
a
minimum
rate
of
$10.00
per
day.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
if
your
honor,
it
gives
a
potential
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
require
that
they
be
notified
of
the
existence
of
the
remedy
and
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
doesn't
know
about
it
a
week
after
it
was
passed.
our
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
our
people
that
are
locked
up
in
jail
where
they
don't
have
television
or
newspapers
or
radios
supposed
to
find
out
about
it.
so
they
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
it
is
not
your
honor,
but
it
is
substantially
the
same
as
a
copy
that
was
printed
in
the
brief
of
the
state
conceding
jurisdiction
and
in
addition,
solicitor
--
city
solicitor
russell
has
sent,
do
i
understand,
copies
of
the
new
statute
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
yes
it
does
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
i'm
aware
of
the
colloquy
before
me
and
i
notice
that
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
said
that
it
would
be
disastrous
because
there'd
be
no
way
to
compel
people
to
pay
traffic
fines,
it
serves
a
very
good
way
of
compelling
people
to
pay
traffic
fines,
and
that
is
to
take
away
their
license
if
they
don't
pay
the
fine,
and
they're
other
traffic
remedies.
so
i
--
let
me
explain
how
we
got
here.
i
have
very
little
time,
and
then
maybe
i
can
start
of
with
my
argument
on
the
equal
protection
and
due
process,
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
excessive
fines
and
involuntary
servitude
when
we
come
back
after
lunch.
we
commenced
this
action
under
42
united
states
code,
section
1983
for
an
injunction
of
the
warden
of
the
baltimore
city
jail
from
--
to
restrain
him
from
holding
people
unconstitutionally
detained,
and
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
two
respects.
in
the
first
place,
it
said
it
was
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
where
i
left
off
your
honor
was
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
it
upheld
the
maryland
$2.00
a
day
statute
as
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
it
held
that
in
each
case,
the
sentencing
judge
had
to
hold
a
hearing
to
allow
persons
to
be
committed
to
tell
a
judge
about
their
indigency
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
do
reduce
the
fine
or
to
put
them
on
probation
or
to
allow
them
to
pay
in
installments
or
to
commit
them.
and
it
also
held
that
as
the
statute
was
being
applied
with
respect
to
costs
at
that
particular
time,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
for
costs
of
people
who
were
not
being
jailed,
for
costs
in
all
cases,
but
they
were
in
some
cases
and
under
the
rinaldi
versus
yeager
case,
this
was
a
discrimination
and
denial
of
equal
protection,
and
at
that
particular
time,
the
statute
could
not
constitutionally
be
applied
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
jail
people
for
non-payment
of
costs.
we
have
appealed
from
the
statute
under
--
from
this
decision
under
the
authority
of
article
xxviii,
section
1253,
and
our
basic
contention
in
this
court
boils
down
really
to
one
premise,
and
that
is
that
one
24-hour
day
in
jail
with
all
of
that
entails
in
terms
of
the
stigma
in
the
community
and
that
fact
the
man
may
loose
his
job,
the
fact
that
man
maybe
subjected
to
the
unpleasant
experiences
of
the
jail,
one
24-hour
a
day
in
jail
does
not
equal
dollars.
the
poor
man
is
being
punished
more
severely
than
the
rich
man
if
the
rich
pays
$2.00
and
the
poor
man
goes
to
jail
for
24-hour
a
day.
we
submit
that
this
goes
to
the
--
initial
is
so
fundamental
that
it's
written
in
stone
on
the
front
of
this
court
house,
equal
justice
under
law.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
the
way
our
society
looks
at
the
man
who
has
paid
the
fine
is
different
from
the
way
our
society
looks
at
the
man
who's
going
to
jail.
the
man
who's
going
to
jail
is
a
criminal.
the
man
who
has
paid
the
fine
as
somebody
who
might
have
gotten
a
traffic
ticket.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it's
--
they
are
not
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
no.
the
maryland
legislature
has
another
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
and
that
is
compel
people
with
money
to
pay.
the
maryland
legislature
has
deliberately
made
the
alternative
to
non-payment
a
harsher
penalty
so
that
people
will
choose
the
--
who
with
money
will
choose
the
alternative
of
paying
and
that's
the
dominant
--
we
submit,
that's
the
only
purpose
behind
the
statute.
the
other
side
disagrees,
but
that
a
certainly
the
dominant
purpose
of
this
statute.
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear
to
collect
money
from
those
who
can't
pay
by
threatening
them
with
jail.
now
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
if
you
jail
those
who
don't
pay,
you're
punishing
a
man
unfairly
in
a
greater
amount
than
the
judge
adjudicated
in
order
to
make
somebody
else
pay.
he's
a
sacrificial
goat
so
to
speak
for
the
man
who
doesn't
want
to
pay
and
has
being
made
to
pay
and
we
submit
this
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
we
have
an
intervener
in
this
case
who's
in
that
very
position.
he
had
something
like
$1,200.00
worth
of
fine.
he
was
a
scofflaw.
he
was
a
school
teacher.
he
went
to
jail
for
--
he
would
have
gone
to
jail,
but
for
this
case
for
over
a
year,
whereas
another
scofflaw
who
had
$1,200.00
would
not
have
gone
to
jail
at
all.
the
school
teacher
lost
his
right
to
teach
school.
he
can
never
teach
school
in
the
state
of
maryland
again
because
they
found
out;
they
found
out
that
he
had
been
sent
to
jail.
the
man
who
pays
the
$1,200.00
because
he's
got
a
--
they
never
find
that
out.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
never
would
have
found
out
if
he
had
the
money
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
i
don't
think
i
am.
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
the
way
justice
treats
two
people,
you're
talking
about
a
fundamental
aspect
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
scofflaw?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
wisdom,
the
state
of
maryland
should
provide
a
statute
that
sends
scofflaws
of
all
kinds
to
jail.
if
scofflaw
should
be
sent
to
jail,
all
scofflaws
should
be
sent
to
jail
and
the
state
of
maryland
can
make
that
decision,
and
i
think
it
should
have
made
that
decision.
what
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
do
is
ruin
the
career
of
one's
scofflaw
in
order
to
make
another
scofflaw
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
didn't
have
$1,200.00
on
the
day
that
he
was
supposed
to
pay.
he
could've
paid
if
he'd
been
allowed
to
pay
in
installments.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
oh,
no,
he
did
not,
that's
true.
he
did
--
the
law
afforded
him
an
opportunity
not
to
commit
a
crime.
it
also
afforded
that
opportunity
to
the
scofflaw
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
think
there's
something
unfair
--
apparently
unfair
that
the
boom
was
lowered
on
him
when
it
was
not
lowered
on
somebody
else
who
led
his
traffic
tickets
accumulate.
two
people,
justice
has
taken
her
blindfold
off
and
look
at
this
man
and
the
only
thing
that
she
has
seen
that's
different
from
the
other
man
as
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
$1,200.00
today.
she's
suppose
to
keep
that
blindfold
on
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
let's
--
i
was
asked
about
the
scofflaw,
this
is
the
actual
--
these
are
the
actual
facts.
let's
take
another
person
who's
committed
disorderly
conduct
case
and
he's
done
it
only
once
and
he's
fined
once
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
single
instance's
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
statute
makes
no
distinction
between
any
of
a
great
variety
of
cases.
the
usual
case
is
obviously
not
to
stop
scofflaw
case.
the
usual
case
is
a
person
who
gets
a
$25.00
fine
or
$50.00
fine.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
this
school
teacher
was
not
a
pauper.
he
just
didn't
have
$1,200.00
at
one
time.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
actually,
he
was
a
part-time
school
teacher
and
he
probably
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
did
not
have
$1,200.00,
but
he
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
signed
an
affidavit
that
he
would
--
could
not
get
to
raise
the
money,
and
i
assume
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
it
does
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
does
not
turn
on
that
case.
it
turns
on
a
statute
which
covers
all
sorts
of
cases.
it
covers
the
man
who
doesn't
have
$10.00,
who
gets
a
$10.00
fine
and
goes
to
jail
for
five
days.
it
covers
the
scofflaw,
it
covers
the
man
who
gets
five
$50.00
fines
in
a
row
for
five
counts
because
he
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
no,
it
certainly
does
not.
that's
the
case
of
the
person
who
contumaciously
refuses
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
there
are
people
who
go
and
pay
fines
and
nobody
ever
hears
about
it.
many
people
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
they
may
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
it
might
be,
it
might
be.
but
there
are
certainly
are
other
people
who
do
not
make
the
newspapers
because
hundreds
of
people
are
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
was
hypothetically
creating
that
other
man.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
but
i'm
sure,
there
are
such
people.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
would
still
have
problems,
but
i
would
have
less
problems.
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
a
sort
of
a
separate
but
equal
doctrine
whereas
a
man
without
money
is
punished
separately
and
--
in
a
way
that's
suppose
to
be
equivalent.
and
because
of
the
other
problems
that
attend
the
jail
punishment,
i
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
equate
jail
punishment
and
the
fine
punishment.
but
certainly,
that
would
be
a
much
better
situation
than
we
have
here
where
we
have
a
$2.00
statute
which
is
designed
to
be
unequal,
because
it's
really
designed
to
compel
the
person
with
the
money
to
pay.
this
statute
cannot
simultaneously
have
the
two
purposes
that
had
been
advanced
for
it,
one
to
equate
jail
and
time
and
fine
money
and
two,
to
compel
people
who
don't
have
money
to
pay
--
that
do
have
money
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
sure.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
sure.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
now,
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
that
the
state
might
design
a
new
statute.
actually,
they
have
attempted
to
do
it.
i
think
the
state
of
maryland
has
recognized
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute
in
passing
the
new
statute
and
they
have
attempted
to
improve
upon
it
and
they
have
raised
the
figure
to
$10.00
a
day.
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
that
is
certainly
more
equal
and
better,
but
it
is
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
what
i
say
is
its
more
equal
but
it
still
no
equal.
it's
a
type
of
separate
but
equal
doctrine
that
that
just
cannot
be
equated.
now,
there
are
other
things
that
the
state
can
do
in
order
to
punish
the
man
or
deter
the
man
that
are
more
equal
to
a
fine
that
he
cannot
--
that
one
of
the
arguments
that's
been
raised
says
there's
no
way
that
the
state
can
punish
these
people;
no
way
that
they
can
deter
them
and
that
just
is
not
true.
there
are
other
things
that
can
be
done.
one
that
we've
suggested
is
that
man
can
be
allowed
to
pay
in
installments.
this
is
actually
fulfilling
the
sentence
of
the
judge
who
sentenced
them.
he
wanted
them
to
pay
a
fine.
he
thought
that
was
the
deterrent.
the
state
legislature
provided
that
the
judge
could
fine
him.
they
expected
him
to
use
his
best
judgment
in
deciding
what
was
appropriate.
he
decided
the
fine
was
appropriate
and
the
way
that
he
can
carry
out
the
state
legislature's
intent
in
the
situation
is
to
allow
the
man
to
pay
on
terms
that
he
can
pay.
this
is
certainly
a
more
equal
alternative.
now,
suppose
the
man
cannot
pay,
he
can
still
put
him
in
jail
as
the
model
penal
code
suggests,
if
the
man
fails
to
make
a
showing
that
he
has
made
reasonable
efforts
to
make
the
money,
get
the
money.
in
that
case,
they'll
be
putting
him
in
jail
for
contempt
or
for
some
additional
act
or
omission,
he
can
take
away
his
driver's
license.
as
the
rinaldi
versus
yeager
case
suggested,
they
can
garnish
his
salary
if
he
has
any
or
collect
the
judgment
by
attachment,
probably
not
a
feasible
way
of
doing
it.
they
can
put
him
on
probation
with
conditions
that
he
worked
in
the
court
house,
you
don't
have
to
lock
him
up
in
maximum
security
in
order
to
get
some
work
out
of
him.
they
can
send
him
to
driver's
school.
i
anticipate
that
mr.
russell
is
going
to
talk
about
mootness
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
so
that
i
can
answer
whatever
he
has
to
say
about
the
mootness.
so,
i'm
going
to
sit
down
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
your
honor,
mr.
russell
and
i
are
talking
about
different
statutes.
he
is
defending
the
new
statute
and
we're
attacking
the
old
statute.
there
is
nobody
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
been
committed
to
jail
in
maryland
so
far
under
the
new
statute.
the
chief
judge
and
the
municipal
court
just
found
out
about
that
statute,
2:30
yesterday
afternoon
from
me.
there
are
a
150
people
in
jail
today
under
the
old
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
does
not
furnish
any
interpretation
that
i
can
see
of
the
power
to
release
these
people
by
general
order
because
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
statute
is
that
each
case
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own
merits,
and
the
$10.00
figure
is
only
a
minimum
figure.
so,
if
the
judge
were
to
deal
with
all
of
these
people
by
general
order,
he
would
be
violating
that
part
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
do
if
they
find
out
about
it.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
that
they're
supposed
to
--
that
they're
to
be
notified.
they
are
indigents.
they
don't
have
lawyers.
they're
in
jail
where
they
don't
have
access
to
news
media.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
we
representing
the
whole
class
of
people
who
are
defined
as
those
people
that
are
in
the
baltimore
city
jail,
and
those
people
that
have
detainers
against
them
and
we
also
submit
that
our
request
for
declaratory
judgment
covers
all
of
those
people
who
have
been
in
jail
since
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
because
they
have
an
interest
in
this
case.
so,
the
burden
is
always
on
the
state
--
on
the
party
asserting
mootness
to
prove
it
and
they're
in
no
position
to
assert
mootness
at
this
point.
in
addition
that
the
new
statute
would
require
these
people
to
be
re-sentenced
in
effect
with
the
possibility
that
they
could
get
a
penalty
that
is
more
severe
than
the
penalty
they
originally
got,
the
fine
and
i
submit
that
there
are
double
jeopardy
problems
there
and
ex
post
facto
law
problems
there.
so,
this
new
statute
simply
is
not
a
way
out
when
you
have
people
that
are
actually
in
jail
under
the
old
statute
at
this
time
and
no
evidence
of
the
new
statute
has
actually
come
into
force
other
than
up
in
the
sky
somewhere.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
all
--
no.
yes
and
no
i
should
say
your
honor.
the
new
statute
merely
gives
them
a
remedy
to
ask
to
have
their
sentences
re
determined
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
submit
that
in
the
broad
argument
that
i've
made
that
jail
could
never
be
equated
with
money.
so,
i
would
have
to
question
it,
but
i'm
not
really
questioning
it
today
because
i
got
a
$2.00
statute
and
under
no
circumstances
can
$2.00
be
equated
with
24
hours.
so,
i
don't
have
to
attack
$10.00
and
i'm
in
a
much
better
position
to
attack
$2.00.
there
is
no
overriding
state
interest
in
punishing
poor
people
at
a
greater
rate
than
rich
people
in
order
to
make
rich
people
pay.
there
is
no
overriding
that
justifies
having
justice
take
her
blindfold
off
and
give
poor
people
a
harsher
penalty
than
the
judge
who
was
charge
with
the
state
law
--
authorized
by
state
law
with
determining
the
appropriate
penalty
determinant.
the
state
has
other
things
that
it
can
do
to
solve
this
problem.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
tell
the
state
what
to
do.
there
are
many
different
alternatives.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
spell
out
for
the
state
what
they
are.
i'm
not
--
i
suggest
an
analogy
that
the
constitution
is
the
foundation
of
our
justice
system,
and
that
state
penal
system
is
the
structure
that
the
state
builds
upon
that
foundation.
in
this
case,
the
system
the
state
has
built
is
off
of
the
foundation
of
equal
justice
under
law,
and
it
is
properly
the
role
of
this
court
to
establish
that
foundation.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
in
the
new
statute,
there
is
and
i
believe
that
could
--
it
could
be
also
be
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
under
the
old
stat
--
the
old
statute
itself
may
not
have
provided
that,
but
there
are
other
provisions.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
believe
so
your
honor.
now
that
of
course
is
that
state's
interest
in
collecting
the
fine.
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
there's
no
rational
way
that
you
can
justify
putting
people
who
don't
have
the
money
in
the
jail.
that
costs
the
state
money
and
they
get
--
it
prevents
them
from
paying
the
fine.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
the
state
does
not
have
a
theory
that
it
collects
these
--
the
fine
in
work.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
certainly.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
certainly
would
not
be
equal.
i
think
that
poor
people
should
be
punished
in
some
way.
i'm
saying
the
state
must
find
an
equal
way
of
punishing
them.
it
certainly
cannot
find
a
grossly
unequal
way
of
punishing
them
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so,
and
it
has
no
compelling
interest
in
punishing
these
people
more
severely
than
other
people
that
are
equally
guilty
of
the
same
offense.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
do.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
in
stratman
v.
stad
stated
that
it
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
let
the
poor
man
go
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
be
let
go.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
do
what
the
judge
decided
should
be
done,
to
find
a
way
to
make
him
pay
his
fine,
and
that
can
be
done.
your
honor
asked
the
question
in
the
previous
argument
about
whether
the
new
statute
will
be
counter
productive,
where
there
a
judge
would
start
sending
people
to
jail.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
judges
will
act
the
way
judges
are
suppose
to
act
and
keep
their
--
the
blindfold
on
as
far
as
the
person's
poverty
is
concerned,
and
that
they
will
be
sentence
people
fairly
and
judicially,
even
though
they
may
under
some
new
scheme
not
be
able
to
send
them
to
jail
for
non-payment
of
a
fine.
so,
i
don't
think
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
don't
think
that
it
will
be
counter
protected.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
oh
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
merely
saying
that
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
select
a
class
of
people
and
treat
them
differently
only
because
of
their
poverty.
if
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
number
of
different
alternative
ways,
probation,
ordering
him
to
pay
work,
order
them
to
work,
ordering
them
to
go
to
driver's
school,
taking
away
the
driver's
license,
ordering
them
to
pay
in
installments,
punishing
then
if
they
did
not
make
a
showing
of
themselves
that
they'd
made
reasonable
efforts
to
get
the
money.
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways
that
the
state
of
maryland
can
in
its
wisdom
decide
what
to
do
about
the
situation.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
these
are
tremendous
problems
and
they
do
require
a
great
deal
of
wisdom.
but
the
foundation
that
that
wisdom
ought
to
be
built
on
the
principle
that's
even
older
than
the
jailer's
fine
statute
that
the
law
looks
at
a
man
without
regard
to
his
status
in
the
community.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
law
--
it
would
only
invalid
as
applied
to
indigents,
but
the
discrimination
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
can
provide
that
if
a
man
fails
to
pay
this
money
fine,
i'm
assuming
they'll
continue
to
find
most
people
provide
a
law
that
says
the
judge
can
either
send
up
to
jail
or
fine
him
in
the
first
instances.
that
in
the
case
where
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
he
cannot
pay,
they
then
must
provide
some
other
means
for
punishing
him,
deterring
him,
collecting
money
from
him,
than
the
one
they
have
provided
here
which
is
to
send
him
to
jail
at
an
unfair
rate.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
when
the
chief
justice
asked
question,
i
said
that
is
--
that
is
my
contention.
all
i
said
i
did
not
have
to
argue
that
in
here
because
the
$2.00
rate
is
unequal
in
any
event
and
this
is
true
of
the
rates
in
most
of
the
state
statutes.
they
have
some
that
are
$1.00
rates.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
don't
know
your
honor.
if
you
had
to
decide
that
question,
i
think
you
can
decide
that
is
not
enough,
especially
when
the
purpose
of
the
state
statute
is
to
make
an
unequal
punishment
in
order
to
collect
the
money
from
that
can
pay.
you
can
decide
that
easily
and
i
have
never
heard
anybody
suggest
to
me
that
$2.00
is
equal
to
24
hours.
nobody
has
actually
asserted
that
to
me
in
two
years
i
been
litigating
this
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
my
position
is
that
$10.00
is
still
not
equal
to
one
day
in
jail,
but
it
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
would
hope
that
you
would
never
decide
it
on
that
basis.
i
would
hope
that
you
would
decide
in
accordance
with
my
philosophy
that
one
day
in
jail
can
never
equal
any
amount
of
money
because
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
if
you
just
decide
it
that
that
would
only
settle
this
case,
it
would
not
settle
the
$10.00
case,
or
the
$15.00
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
but
it
would
settle
the
other
case
if
you
went
further
than
i
have
asked
you
to
go
and
reach
the
basic
value
judgment
that
jail
and
money
cannot
be
equated,
it
would
settle
all
the
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
understand
that.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
could
equal
two
people,
yes
it
can.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
could
be
done
and
it
has
been
done
in
country
like
sweden
where
they
have
the
day
fine
principle,
where
the
judge
attempts
to
sting
the
man's
pocket
book
by
an
amount
that
will
take
into
account
how
much
he
can
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
then
it
seems
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
probably
true.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
you'd
have
to
collect
the
money
from
the
--
at
a
later
time
or
in
a
different
way?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
then,
you
have
to
find
some
other
way
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
i
don't
get
down
not
far
your
honor,
but
it's
--
i
understand
how
a
person
could
see
that.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
you
like
decide
to
do
it,
but
i'm
not
urging
you
to.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
fisher.
i
represent
a
class
of
plaintiff
appellants.
the
class
is
defined
as
those
people
who
are
incarcerated
in
the
baltimore
city
jail
and
we
have
defined
it
as
a
continuing
class.
we
brought
this
action
in
july
1968
and
there
are
currently
about
a
150
people
in
the
baltimore
city
jail
under
the
statute
that
we
are
attacking.
this
case
is
different
from
the
williams
case
that
the
court
has
just
heard,
in
that
there,
only
i
--
and
unusual
application
of
the
jail
or
fine
statute
was
being
contested.
the
situation
where
the
judge
gives
both
the
maximum
jail
sentence
and
a
fine,
and
the
person
is
required
to
serve
more
than
the
maximum
amount
allowed.
our
case
covers
all
types
of
incarceration
for
non-payment
of
fines
except
the
contumacious
refusal
to
pay
situation.
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
our
case
involves
a
two-dollar
rate
instead
of
a
five-dollar
rate.
it
is
a
mandatory
rate
as
the
statute
says
the
judge
shall
commit
him
and
then
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
statute,
then
the
statute
provides
a
two-dollar
rate.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
$2.00
per
day.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right
your
honor.
the
new
statute
should
be
enforced,
but
it
is
not.
i
called
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
of
baltimore
city
yesterday,
and
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
new
statute.
he
asked
me
to
send
him
a
copy
which
i
did.
i
called
the
jail
and
they
said
they
had
not
heard
of
the
new
statute
and
that
nobody
was
getting
out
under
it.
the
new
statute
by
the
way
just
gives
a
judicial
remedy.
it
does
not
say
that
everybody
who's
committed
under
the
old
statute
should
get
out,
and
only
gives
them
a
right
to
apply
to
the
justice
that
committed
them
for
re-determination
under
the
new
statute
and
it
does
not
guarantee
that
we
--
they
will
get
out.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
has
a
minimum
rate
of
$10.00
per
day.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
if
your
honor,
it
gives
a
potential
remedy,
but
it
doesn't
require
that
they
be
notified
of
the
existence
of
the
remedy
and
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
doesn't
know
about
it
a
week
after
it
was
passed.
our
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
our
people
that
are
locked
up
in
jail
where
they
don't
have
television
or
newspapers
or
radios
supposed
to
find
out
about
it.
so
they
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
it
is
not
your
honor,
but
it
is
substantially
the
same
as
a
copy
that
was
printed
in
the
brief
of
the
state
conceding
jurisdiction
and
in
addition,
solicitor
--
city
solicitor
russell
has
sent,
do
i
understand,
copies
of
the
new
statute
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
yes
it
does
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
i'm
aware
of
the
colloquy
before
me
and
i
notice
that
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
said
that
it
would
be
disastrous
because
there'd
be
no
way
to
compel
people
to
pay
traffic
fines,
it
serves
a
very
good
way
of
compelling
people
to
pay
traffic
fines,
and
that
is
to
take
away
their
license
if
they
don't
pay
the
fine,
and
they're
other
traffic
remedies.
so
i
--
let
me
explain
how
we
got
here.
i
have
very
little
time,
and
then
maybe
i
can
start
of
with
my
argument
on
the
equal
protection
and
due
process,
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
excessive
fines
and
involuntary
servitude
when
we
come
back
after
lunch.
we
commenced
this
action
under
42
united
states
code,
section
1983
for
an
injunction
of
the
warden
of
the
baltimore
city
jail
from
--
to
restrain
him
from
holding
people
unconstitutionally
detained,
and
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
that
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
two
respects.
in
the
first
place,
it
said
it
was
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
where
i
left
off
your
honor
was
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
it
upheld
the
maryland
$2.00
a
day
statute
as
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
it
held
that
in
each
case,
the
sentencing
judge
had
to
hold
a
hearing
to
allow
persons
to
be
committed
to
tell
a
judge
about
their
indigency
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
or
not
do
reduce
the
fine
or
to
put
them
on
probation
or
to
allow
them
to
pay
in
installments
or
to
commit
them.
and
it
also
held
that
as
the
statute
was
being
applied
with
respect
to
costs
at
that
particular
time,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
for
costs
of
people
who
were
not
being
jailed,
for
costs
in
all
cases,
but
they
were
in
some
cases
and
under
the
rinaldi
versus
yeager
case,
this
was
a
discrimination
and
denial
of
equal
protection,
and
at
that
particular
time,
the
statute
could
not
constitutionally
be
applied
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
jail
people
for
non-payment
of
costs.
we
have
appealed
from
the
statute
under
--
from
this
decision
under
the
authority
of
article
xxviii,
section
1253,
and
our
basic
contention
in
this
court
boils
down
really
to
one
premise,
and
that
is
that
one
24-hour
day
in
jail
with
all
of
that
entails
in
terms
of
the
stigma
in
the
community
and
that
fact
the
man
may
loose
his
job,
the
fact
that
man
maybe
subjected
to
the
unpleasant
experiences
of
the
jail,
one
24-hour
a
day
in
jail
does
not
equal
dollars.
the
poor
man
is
being
punished
more
severely
than
the
rich
man
if
the
rich
pays
$2.00
and
the
poor
man
goes
to
jail
for
24-hour
a
day.
we
submit
that
this
goes
to
the
--
initial
is
so
fundamental
that
it's
written
in
stone
on
the
front
of
this
court
house,
equal
justice
under
law.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
the
way
our
society
looks
at
the
man
who
has
paid
the
fine
is
different
from
the
way
our
society
looks
at
the
man
who's
going
to
jail.
the
man
who's
going
to
jail
is
a
criminal.
the
man
who
has
paid
the
fine
as
somebody
who
might
have
gotten
a
traffic
ticket.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it's
--
they
are
not
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
no.
the
maryland
legislature
has
another
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
and
that
is
compel
people
with
money
to
pay.
the
maryland
legislature
has
deliberately
made
the
alternative
to
non-payment
a
harsher
penalty
so
that
people
will
choose
the
--
who
with
money
will
choose
the
alternative
of
paying
and
that's
the
dominant
--
we
submit,
that's
the
only
purpose
behind
the
statute.
the
other
side
disagrees,
but
that
a
certainly
the
dominant
purpose
of
this
statute.
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear
to
collect
money
from
those
who
can't
pay
by
threatening
them
with
jail.
now
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
if
you
jail
those
who
don't
pay,
you're
punishing
a
man
unfairly
in
a
greater
amount
than
the
judge
adjudicated
in
order
to
make
somebody
else
pay.
he's
a
sacrificial
goat
so
to
speak
for
the
man
who
doesn't
want
to
pay
and
has
being
made
to
pay
and
we
submit
this
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
we
have
an
intervener
in
this
case
who's
in
that
very
position.
he
had
something
like
$1,200.00
worth
of
fine.
he
was
a
scofflaw.
he
was
a
school
teacher.
he
went
to
jail
for
--
he
would
have
gone
to
jail,
but
for
this
case
for
over
a
year,
whereas
another
scofflaw
who
had
$1,200.00
would
not
have
gone
to
jail
at
all.
the
school
teacher
lost
his
right
to
teach
school.
he
can
never
teach
school
in
the
state
of
maryland
again
because
they
found
out;
they
found
out
that
he
had
been
sent
to
jail.
the
man
who
pays
the
$1,200.00
because
he's
got
a
--
they
never
find
that
out.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
never
would
have
found
out
if
he
had
the
money
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
i
don't
think
i
am.
i
think
when
you're
talking
about
the
way
justice
treats
two
people,
you're
talking
about
a
fundamental
aspect
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
scofflaw?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
wisdom,
the
state
of
maryland
should
provide
a
statute
that
sends
scofflaws
of
all
kinds
to
jail.
if
scofflaw
should
be
sent
to
jail,
all
scofflaws
should
be
sent
to
jail
and
the
state
of
maryland
can
make
that
decision,
and
i
think
it
should
have
made
that
decision.
what
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
do
is
ruin
the
career
of
one's
scofflaw
in
order
to
make
another
scofflaw
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
didn't
have
$1,200.00
on
the
day
that
he
was
supposed
to
pay.
he
could've
paid
if
he'd
been
allowed
to
pay
in
installments.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
oh,
no,
he
did
not,
that's
true.
he
did
--
the
law
afforded
him
an
opportunity
not
to
commit
a
crime.
it
also
afforded
that
opportunity
to
the
scofflaw
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
think
there's
something
unfair
--
apparently
unfair
that
the
boom
was
lowered
on
him
when
it
was
not
lowered
on
somebody
else
who
led
his
traffic
tickets
accumulate.
two
people,
justice
has
taken
her
blindfold
off
and
look
at
this
man
and
the
only
thing
that
she
has
seen
that's
different
from
the
other
man
as
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
$1,200.00
today.
she's
suppose
to
keep
that
blindfold
on
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
let's
--
i
was
asked
about
the
scofflaw,
this
is
the
actual
--
these
are
the
actual
facts.
let's
take
another
person
who's
committed
disorderly
conduct
case
and
he's
done
it
only
once
and
he's
fined
once
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
single
instance's
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
statute
makes
no
distinction
between
any
of
a
great
variety
of
cases.
the
usual
case
is
obviously
not
to
stop
scofflaw
case.
the
usual
case
is
a
person
who
gets
a
$25.00
fine
or
$50.00
fine.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
this
school
teacher
was
not
a
pauper.
he
just
didn't
have
$1,200.00
at
one
time.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
actually,
he
was
a
part-time
school
teacher
and
he
probably
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
did
not
have
$1,200.00,
but
he
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
he
signed
an
affidavit
that
he
would
--
could
not
get
to
raise
the
money,
and
i
assume
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
it
does
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
does
not
turn
on
that
case.
it
turns
on
a
statute
which
covers
all
sorts
of
cases.
it
covers
the
man
who
doesn't
have
$10.00,
who
gets
a
$10.00
fine
and
goes
to
jail
for
five
days.
it
covers
the
scofflaw,
it
covers
the
man
who
gets
five
$50.00
fines
in
a
row
for
five
counts
because
he
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no,
no,
it
certainly
does
not.
that's
the
case
of
the
person
who
contumaciously
refuses
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
there
are
people
who
go
and
pay
fines
and
nobody
ever
hears
about
it.
many
people
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
they
may
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
it
might
be,
it
might
be.
but
there
are
certainly
are
other
people
who
do
not
make
the
newspapers
because
hundreds
of
people
are
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
was
hypothetically
creating
that
other
man.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
but
i'm
sure,
there
are
such
people.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
would
still
have
problems,
but
i
would
have
less
problems.
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
a
sort
of
a
separate
but
equal
doctrine
whereas
a
man
without
money
is
punished
separately
and
--
in
a
way
that's
suppose
to
be
equivalent.
and
because
of
the
other
problems
that
attend
the
jail
punishment,
i
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
equate
jail
punishment
and
the
fine
punishment.
but
certainly,
that
would
be
a
much
better
situation
than
we
have
here
where
we
have
a
$2.00
statute
which
is
designed
to
be
unequal,
because
it's
really
designed
to
compel
the
person
with
the
money
to
pay.
this
statute
cannot
simultaneously
have
the
two
purposes
that
had
been
advanced
for
it,
one
to
equate
jail
and
time
and
fine
money
and
two,
to
compel
people
who
don't
have
money
to
pay
--
that
do
have
money
to
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
sure.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
sure.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
right.
now,
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
that
the
state
might
design
a
new
statute.
actually,
they
have
attempted
to
do
it.
i
think
the
state
of
maryland
has
recognized
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute
in
passing
the
new
statute
and
they
have
attempted
to
improve
upon
it
and
they
have
raised
the
figure
to
$10.00
a
day.
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
that
is
certainly
more
equal
and
better,
but
it
is
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
what
i
say
is
its
more
equal
but
it
still
no
equal.
it's
a
type
of
separate
but
equal
doctrine
that
that
just
cannot
be
equated.
now,
there
are
other
things
that
the
state
can
do
in
order
to
punish
the
man
or
deter
the
man
that
are
more
equal
to
a
fine
that
he
cannot
--
that
one
of
the
arguments
that's
been
raised
says
there's
no
way
that
the
state
can
punish
these
people;
no
way
that
they
can
deter
them
and
that
just
is
not
true.
there
are
other
things
that
can
be
done.
one
that
we've
suggested
is
that
man
can
be
allowed
to
pay
in
installments.
this
is
actually
fulfilling
the
sentence
of
the
judge
who
sentenced
them.
he
wanted
them
to
pay
a
fine.
he
thought
that
was
the
deterrent.
the
state
legislature
provided
that
the
judge
could
fine
him.
they
expected
him
to
use
his
best
judgment
in
deciding
what
was
appropriate.
he
decided
the
fine
was
appropriate
and
the
way
that
he
can
carry
out
the
state
legislature's
intent
in
the
situation
is
to
allow
the
man
to
pay
on
terms
that
he
can
pay.
this
is
certainly
a
more
equal
alternative.
now,
suppose
the
man
cannot
pay,
he
can
still
put
him
in
jail
as
the
model
penal
code
suggests,
if
the
man
fails
to
make
a
showing
that
he
has
made
reasonable
efforts
to
make
the
money,
get
the
money.
in
that
case,
they'll
be
putting
him
in
jail
for
contempt
or
for
some
additional
act
or
omission,
he
can
take
away
his
driver's
license.
as
the
rinaldi
versus
yeager
case
suggested,
they
can
garnish
his
salary
if
he
has
any
or
collect
the
judgment
by
attachment,
probably
not
a
feasible
way
of
doing
it.
they
can
put
him
on
probation
with
conditions
that
he
worked
in
the
court
house,
you
don't
have
to
lock
him
up
in
maximum
security
in
order
to
get
some
work
out
of
him.
they
can
send
him
to
driver's
school.
i
anticipate
that
mr.
russell
is
going
to
talk
about
mootness
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
so
that
i
can
answer
whatever
he
has
to
say
about
the
mootness.
so,
i'm
going
to
sit
down
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
your
honor,
mr.
russell
and
i
are
talking
about
different
statutes.
he
is
defending
the
new
statute
and
we're
attacking
the
old
statute.
there
is
nobody
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
been
committed
to
jail
in
maryland
so
far
under
the
new
statute.
the
chief
judge
and
the
municipal
court
just
found
out
about
that
statute,
2:30
yesterday
afternoon
from
me.
there
are
a
150
people
in
jail
today
under
the
old
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
does
not
furnish
any
interpretation
that
i
can
see
of
the
power
to
release
these
people
by
general
order
because
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
statute
is
that
each
case
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own
merits,
and
the
$10.00
figure
is
only
a
minimum
figure.
so,
if
the
judge
were
to
deal
with
all
of
these
people
by
general
order,
he
would
be
violating
that
part
of
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
do
if
they
find
out
about
it.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
that
they're
supposed
to
--
that
they're
to
be
notified.
they
are
indigents.
they
don't
have
lawyers.
they're
in
jail
where
they
don't
have
access
to
news
media.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
we
representing
the
whole
class
of
people
who
are
defined
as
those
people
that
are
in
the
baltimore
city
jail,
and
those
people
that
have
detainers
against
them
and
we
also
submit
that
our
request
for
declaratory
judgment
covers
all
of
those
people
who
have
been
in
jail
since
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit
because
they
have
an
interest
in
this
case.
so,
the
burden
is
always
on
the
state
--
on
the
party
asserting
mootness
to
prove
it
and
they're
in
no
position
to
assert
mootness
at
this
point.
in
addition
that
the
new
statute
would
require
these
people
to
be
re-sentenced
in
effect
with
the
possibility
that
they
could
get
a
penalty
that
is
more
severe
than
the
penalty
they
originally
got,
the
fine
and
i
submit
that
there
are
double
jeopardy
problems
there
and
ex
post
facto
law
problems
there.
so,
this
new
statute
simply
is
not
a
way
out
when
you
have
people
that
are
actually
in
jail
under
the
old
statute
at
this
time
and
no
evidence
of
the
new
statute
has
actually
come
into
force
other
than
up
in
the
sky
somewhere.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
all
--
no.
yes
and
no
i
should
say
your
honor.
the
new
statute
merely
gives
them
a
remedy
to
ask
to
have
their
sentences
re
determined
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
submit
that
in
the
broad
argument
that
i've
made
that
jail
could
never
be
equated
with
money.
so,
i
would
have
to
question
it,
but
i'm
not
really
questioning
it
today
because
i
got
a
$2.00
statute
and
under
no
circumstances
can
$2.00
be
equated
with
24
hours.
so,
i
don't
have
to
attack
$10.00
and
i'm
in
a
much
better
position
to
attack
$2.00.
there
is
no
overriding
state
interest
in
punishing
poor
people
at
a
greater
rate
than
rich
people
in
order
to
make
rich
people
pay.
there
is
no
overriding
that
justifies
having
justice
take
her
blindfold
off
and
give
poor
people
a
harsher
penalty
than
the
judge
who
was
charge
with
the
state
law
--
authorized
by
state
law
with
determining
the
appropriate
penalty
determinant.
the
state
has
other
things
that
it
can
do
to
solve
this
problem.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
tell
the
state
what
to
do.
there
are
many
different
alternatives.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
spell
out
for
the
state
what
they
are.
i'm
not
--
i
suggest
an
analogy
that
the
constitution
is
the
foundation
of
our
justice
system,
and
that
state
penal
system
is
the
structure
that
the
state
builds
upon
that
foundation.
in
this
case,
the
system
the
state
has
built
is
off
of
the
foundation
of
equal
justice
under
law,
and
it
is
properly
the
role
of
this
court
to
establish
that
foundation.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
in
the
new
statute,
there
is
and
i
believe
that
could
--
it
could
be
also
be
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
under
the
old
stat
--
the
old
statute
itself
may
not
have
provided
that,
but
there
are
other
provisions.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
believe
so
your
honor.
now
that
of
course
is
that
state's
interest
in
collecting
the
fine.
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
there's
no
rational
way
that
you
can
justify
putting
people
who
don't
have
the
money
in
the
jail.
that
costs
the
state
money
and
they
get
--
it
prevents
them
from
paying
the
fine.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
the
state
does
not
have
a
theory
that
it
collects
these
--
the
fine
in
work.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
certainly.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
certainly
would
not
be
equal.
i
think
that
poor
people
should
be
punished
in
some
way.
i'm
saying
the
state
must
find
an
equal
way
of
punishing
them.
it
certainly
cannot
find
a
grossly
unequal
way
of
punishing
them
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so,
and
it
has
no
compelling
interest
in
punishing
these
people
more
severely
than
other
people
that
are
equally
guilty
of
the
same
offense.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
do.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
in
stratman
v.
stad
stated
that
it
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
let
the
poor
man
go
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
be
let
go.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
do
what
the
judge
decided
should
be
done,
to
find
a
way
to
make
him
pay
his
fine,
and
that
can
be
done.
your
honor
asked
the
question
in
the
previous
argument
about
whether
the
new
statute
will
be
counter
productive,
where
there
a
judge
would
start
sending
people
to
jail.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
judges
will
act
the
way
judges
are
suppose
to
act
and
keep
their
--
the
blindfold
on
as
far
as
the
person's
poverty
is
concerned,
and
that
they
will
be
sentence
people
fairly
and
judicially,
even
though
they
may
under
some
new
scheme
not
be
able
to
send
them
to
jail
for
non-payment
of
a
fine.
so,
i
don't
think
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
don't
think
that
it
will
be
counter
protected.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
oh
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
merely
saying
that
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
select
a
class
of
people
and
treat
them
differently
only
because
of
their
poverty.
if
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
number
of
different
alternative
ways,
probation,
ordering
him
to
pay
work,
order
them
to
work,
ordering
them
to
go
to
driver's
school,
taking
away
the
driver's
license,
ordering
them
to
pay
in
installments,
punishing
then
if
they
did
not
make
a
showing
of
themselves
that
they'd
made
reasonable
efforts
to
get
the
money.
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways
that
the
state
of
maryland
can
in
its
wisdom
decide
what
to
do
about
the
situation.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
these
are
tremendous
problems
and
they
do
require
a
great
deal
of
wisdom.
but
the
foundation
that
that
wisdom
ought
to
be
built
on
the
principle
that's
even
older
than
the
jailer's
fine
statute
that
the
law
looks
at
a
man
without
regard
to
his
status
in
the
community.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
the
law
--
it
would
only
invalid
as
applied
to
indigents,
but
the
discrimination
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
they
can
provide
that
if
a
man
fails
to
pay
this
money
fine,
i'm
assuming
they'll
continue
to
find
most
people
provide
a
law
that
says
the
judge
can
either
send
up
to
jail
or
fine
him
in
the
first
instances.
that
in
the
case
where
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
he
cannot
pay,
they
then
must
provide
some
other
means
for
punishing
him,
deterring
him,
collecting
money
from
him,
than
the
one
they
have
provided
here
which
is
to
send
him
to
jail
at
an
unfair
rate.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
when
the
chief
justice
asked
question,
i
said
that
is
--
that
is
my
contention.
all
i
said
i
did
not
have
to
argue
that
in
here
because
the
$2.00
rate
is
unequal
in
any
event
and
this
is
true
of
the
rates
in
most
of
the
state
statutes.
they
have
some
that
are
$1.00
rates.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
don't
know
your
honor.
if
you
had
to
decide
that
question,
i
think
you
can
decide
that
is
not
enough,
especially
when
the
purpose
of
the
state
statute
is
to
make
an
unequal
punishment
in
order
to
collect
the
money
from
that
can
pay.
you
can
decide
that
easily
and
i
have
never
heard
anybody
suggest
to
me
that
$2.00
is
equal
to
24
hours.
nobody
has
actually
asserted
that
to
me
in
two
years
i
been
litigating
this
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
my
position
is
that
$10.00
is
still
not
equal
to
one
day
in
jail,
but
it
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
would
hope
that
you
would
never
decide
it
on
that
basis.
i
would
hope
that
you
would
decide
in
accordance
with
my
philosophy
that
one
day
in
jail
can
never
equal
any
amount
of
money
because
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
if
you
just
decide
it
that
that
would
only
settle
this
case,
it
would
not
settle
the
$10.00
case,
or
the
$15.00
case.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
no.
but
it
would
settle
the
other
case
if
you
went
further
than
i
have
asked
you
to
go
and
reach
the
basic
value
judgment
that
jail
and
money
cannot
be
equated,
it
would
settle
all
the
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
understand
that.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
could
equal
two
people,
yes
it
can.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
it
could
be
done
and
it
has
been
done
in
country
like
sweden
where
they
have
the
day
fine
principle,
where
the
judge
attempts
to
sting
the
man's
pocket
book
by
an
amount
that
will
take
into
account
how
much
he
can
pay.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
then
it
seems
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
that's
probably
true.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
you'd
have
to
collect
the
money
from
the
--
at
a
later
time
or
in
a
different
way?
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
then,
you
have
to
find
some
other
way
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
well,
i
don't
get
down
not
far
your
honor,
but
it's
--
i
understand
how
a
person
could
see
that.
mr.
robert
g.
fisher
you
like
decide
to
do
it,
but
i'm
not
urging
you
to.
