i
think
we'll
suspend
for
lunch
now
mr.

and
pick
up
after

[luncheon
break]
mr.
fisher,
you
may
pick
up
where
you
left
off.
chief

warren
e.

do
you
think
the
appraisal
would
have
been
higher
if
he
had
just
--
if
they
found
out
that
he
just
had
scoffed
at
the
law
for
$1,200.00
worth
of
traffic
tickets?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
now,
you're
talking
just
about
a
practical
aspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
think
they
should
have
treated
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
he
could
not
have
paid
that
fine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
realize,
we're
not
arguing
the
school
teacher's
case
today
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
but
for
years
that
this
an
analogy
and
i'm
lost.
if
he
was
a
school
teacher
presumably,
he
got
paid
for
teaching
school,
what
would
be
unjust
about
sending
him
to
jail
when
he
could've
paid
and
didn't?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
the
law
afforded
him
an
opportunity
to
pay
it
installment
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn't
get
on
these
traffic
tickets
on
one
day
or
one
week,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute.
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
to
pay
two,
four
or
$6.00
each
time
he
got
the
tickets,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
and
now,
you
suggest
that
there's
something
inherently
unfair
about
the
fact
that
the
boom
was
lowered
on
him
finally
at
the
$1,200.00
mark?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
your
school
teacher
analogy
doesn't
help
you
or
this
--
or
your
case
very
much.
i'm
puzzled
yet
by
what
it
supposed
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
single
instance
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
the
same
as
the
school
teacher
who
let
$1,200.00
for
the
traffic
tickets
accumulate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fisher,
well,
we
have
you
stopped
for
a
moment.
i
can
sympathize
with
your
arguments
about
$2.00
a
day
for
24-hour
a
day.
what
if
the
maryland
legislature
had
said
that
it
should
be
tied
to
the
minimum
wage
established
by
the
department
of
labor
which
i
think
is
a
$1.60
an
hour
now,
isn't
it?
if
that
so,
that'd
be
$38.48.
suppose
they
fixed
it
to
that
and
you
got
$38.48
credit
on
a
fine
for
every
24
hours
he
served
in
jail,
would
you
have
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
true
mootness
perhaps
could
have
done
right
on
--
by
action
yesterday
by
an
appropriate
general
order,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
judge
allow
him
to
pay
the
fine
on
installments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
figures
you
gave
us
first,
that
3
%,
was
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
0.3
%,
was
that
traffic
or
non-traffic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
out
of
the
total
of
how
many?
just
approximate,
we
don't
need
the
precisely
--
i
lost
that
figure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
go
on
with
your
argument,
and
if
that
shows
up
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
russell.
mr.
fisher?
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
it
furnishes
them
with
the
--
it
does
furnish
in
the
administrative
means
of
softening
that,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
let's
lay
aside
the
general
order
mechanism.
individually
each
incarcerated
person
or
a
person
now
on
bail
as
your
client
has
in
some
form
of
the
administrative
remedy
available,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quasi
judicial
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
obviously,
the
people
that
you're
talking
about,
the
people
you're
representing
here
today
now
before
us
do
know
about
through
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
i'm
sure
equal
protection
thing
here
with
perhaps
or
rather
exaggerated
hypothetical
case.
suppose
--
first,
i
assume
that
when
you
talk
about
rich
people,
you
mean
any
person
who
is
able
to
pay,
that
is
a
plumber
or
an
electrician
who's
making
$600.00
to
a
$1,000.00
a
month
is
what
you
call
a
rich
person
for
these
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
a
group
of
plumbers
and
electricians
and
newspaper
reporters
would
say
all
band
together
and
say
that
there
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
they
must
pay
their
fines
in
cash,
whereas
13,412
people
under
your
theory
what
the
law
to
be
didn't
have
any
money
to
pay
at
the
time
and
therefore,
they
were
excused
from
paying
the
fine
that
the
man
is
making
a
salary
has
been
required
to
do
so,
is
that
a
denial
of
equal
protection
in
the
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
you
do
seem
to
concede
that
this
other
category
i
spoke
of,
electrician,
etcetera.
chief

they
would
