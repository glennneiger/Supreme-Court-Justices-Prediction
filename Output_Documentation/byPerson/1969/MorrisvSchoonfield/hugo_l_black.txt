justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
going
to
ask
does
it
have
a
date
and
rate,
in
the
new
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
a
traffic
--
would
the
statistics
and
traffic
violators
really
be
your
fair
showing
are
the
pattern
of
statistics
in
all
kinds
of
crimes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
it
is
true
wouldn't
it
that
you'd
assume
that
if
you
had
a
law
for
instance
that
made
every
company,
wholesale
nation,
they
won't
say
a
company
or
the
nation
be
a
license
of
$15.00,
you
wouldn't
have
much
trouble
for
that
$15.00,
and
you
wouldn't
have
much
trouble
collecting
the
fine
that
could
be
imposed
as
a
rule
on
a
traffic
violator,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
suggest
that
maryland
can
handle
this
problem?
are
you
saying
that
all
punishment
of
money
are
necessary
going
because
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
--
the
extent,
what
you
say
happens
to
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
requires
a
pretty
good
amount
of
wisdom,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
depend
on
what
you're
doing
in
these
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
law
be
invalid
only
as
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
it
can't
be
done?
you
can
have
a
law
that
fixes
a
punishment
by
payment
of
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
a
situation
where
you
claim
that
the
law
is
invalid,
either
as
applied
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
it's
invalid
on
it
face,
invalid
as
applied
to
everybody,
what
substitute
can
the
state
of
maryland
or
any
state
provide
for
punishment
but
money
fines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
would
we
decide
that
question
fact,
you
say
in
any
case,
$2.00
is
not
enough.
how
would
we
decide
what
is
enough?
justice
hugo

who
is
admitted
$10.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
admitted
$10.00?
justice
hugo

and
you
get
to
going
up
until
we
could
find
some
way
of
to
say
that
well,
not
a
work,
but
they
requires
with
as
much
as
in
the
man
have
to
pay
in
money?
that's
a
pretty
difficult
task.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
just
settle
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
just
settle
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
it
wouldn't
settle
them
all,
would
it?
if
we
just
decided
that
certain
amount
of
money
is
too
little
to
compensate
for
the
fine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
and
settle,
the
deep
problem
is
raised
for
you
gentlemen
here
today,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
and
it
maybe
right,
i
am
not
saying
it's
right
or
wrong,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
and
the
other
arguments
made
today
on
that
side
assume
that
no
law
can
be
passed,
which
makes
it
fair
and
on
non-violation
of
the
equal
protection
law
to
fix
punishment
by
fines.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
you
pass
a
law
that
will
equalize
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
here's
a
man
with
the
$100,000.00,
there's
another
one
that
makes
$30.00
a
week.
how
could
you
equalize
of
your
fine
of
money
for
those
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe
he
couldn't
afford
to
pay
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that's
true
that
some
of
them
couldn't
afford
to
pay
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
too
poor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
do
then
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
might
not
make
another,
it
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
have
to
get
down
--
don't
you
finally,
bedrock
argument
that
punishment
by
fine
is
so
inherently
unfair
and
unjust
and
discriminating
between
people
that
it
should
be
allowed.
justice

might
