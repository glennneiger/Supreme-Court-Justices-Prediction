justice
potter
stewart
your
statute
has
been
substantially
amended
and
i
--
but
i
expect
you're
going
to
tell
us
about
that
in
due
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
gives
a
judicial
--
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
gives
a
judicial
potential,
judicial
remedy
to
those
now
in
jail,
and
it
also
for
the
future
sets
up
a
--
quite
inconsistent
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
now
you
told
him.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
would
that
argument
go?
let's
assume
a
$10.00
fine
on
a
person
and
that
person
--
all
that
all
that
person
possessed
in
the
world
is
$10.00
as
compared
to
a
$10.00
fine
on
a
person
who
had
a
million
dollars.
now
that
would
be
unequal
protection,
wouldn't
it,
under
your
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
not
what
the
maryland
legislature
has
said.
maryland
legislature
said
they
are
equivalent.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
society
as
represented
in
the
maryland
legislature
disagrees
with
you,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
jailing
those
who
don't
pay,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
to
happen
to
the
scofflaw
who
collects
dozens
and
dozens
of
parking
tickets
in
his
friend's
automobile
and
who
hasn't
got
a
nickel
to
his
name?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
premise
of
the
latter
proposition
is
that
it's
much
easier
to
--
to
go
to
jail
is
much
more
unpleasant
than
to
pay.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they're
not
equal?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
isn't
really
dusting
it
mr.
fisher,
i
want
to
know
what
you
have
to
say
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
that
legislation
become
effective?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
new
law
your
point
is,
the
new
law
with
all
its
ameliorations
nonetheless
still
does
preserve
the
theory
of
substitute
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
if
you
understand
your
brother
on
the
other
side
attacks
continues
to
attack
in
that
it
is
that
that
you're
here
to
do
--
to
defend?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
take
a
fine
and
reduce
it
a
judgment?
is
there
any
provision
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
old
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
other
provision
of
law
that
entitle
the
status
creditor
or
reduce
the
fine
to
a
judgment,
then
have
all
the
benefits
of
the
judgment
creditor?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
work,
i
forgot
that
there's
--
there's
not
the
same
kind
of
work
program
here
is
there
was
in
the
previous
case,
am
i
mistaken
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
are
basic
contention
was
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
jail
a
person
and
lieu
of
a
money
fine
at
any
rate,
at
any
rate
that
there's
a
difference
not
only
in
the
degree,
but
in
kind
between
those
two
punishments,
a
constitutional
difference
in
kind
between
the
fine
and
imprisonment
and
that
violates
the
equal
protection
to
have
any
prisoner
in
lieu
of
the
money
fine.
justice

stewart
your
