justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
fisher,
you're
in
further
trouble
because
i've
never
heard
of
a
school
teacher
being
able
to
plead
that
he
was
a
pauper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could've
gotten
it
unless
the
banks
were
all
closed
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
wasn't
a
pauper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anything
that
he
couldn't
get
$1,200.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
argument.
i
would
hate
to
see
this
case
turn
on
that
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
hypothetical
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
your
case
--
your
case,
not
the
statute,
cover
a
man
who
lies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who's
not
a
pauper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
could
get
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
unless
conditions
have
changed
in
baltimore,
if
you
have
that
many
convictions
of
any
kind,
you
loose
your
job
as
a
teacher
when
you
pay
the
fine
or
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
where
they
do
hear
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
assume
that
the
$1,200.00,
it
was
in
the
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
other
man
that
had
$1,200.00
and
paid
the
fine,
where
did
you
find
that
out
except
the
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
russel,
if
you
did
have
the
alternative
in
the
state
of
maryland,
you
have
a
judicial
order
which
would
have
released
this
man
yesterday,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
reason
are
you
here
other
than
seeking
to
get
this
court
to
approve
a
law
that
doesn't
apply
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
makes
no
difference
as
to
whether
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
or
the
chief
judge
of
the
supreme
bench
issues
an
order,
either
way,
this
petitioner
that
gets
out
if
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
is
it
that
a
man
who's
a
millionaire
commits
the
exact
same
crime
as
the
pauper,
and
the
millionaire
pays
a
fine
and
the
pauper
goes
to
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
that
simple?
is
the
problem
that
simple?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
saying
that
everybody
who
violates
this
law
goes
to
jail;
that's
one
way
of
doing
it,
and
that
wouldn't
violate
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
it
would
be
irreparable
harm
to
imprison
a
millionaire?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
only
thing
i
see
here
in
my
case
in
yours
is
i
say
that
when
you
put
a
poor
man
in
jail
and
let
the
man
who
can
pay
his
fine,
pay
his
fine
or
you
can
say
everybody
that
commits
this
crime
shall
go
to
jail?
now,
i
don't
see
how
either
one
while
the
last
one
hurts
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
absolutely
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'd
be
interested
in
the
case
you'll
cite
to
me
which
says
that
you
can
make
poor
people
a
class
that
the
state
can
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
anything
close?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
anything
close?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
in
the
state
of
maryland
in
its
criminal
process
can
say
that
a
pauper
is
in
a
class
by
himself,
and
shall
have
sentences
based
on
him
solely
because
he's
a
pauper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
alternate
punishment
is
also
given
to
the
rich
man.
he
could
either
pay
his
fine
or
go
to
jail,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
poor
man
doesn't
have
that
alternative?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
solely
because
he's
poor
that
he
goes
to
jail?
the
only
reason
he
goes
to
jail
is
because
in
the
same
category
of
everybody
convicted
of
this
one
crime,
everybody
convicted
of
a
crime,
the
only
man
who
must
go
to
jail
is
the
poor
man.
is
that
true
under
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
justify
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
take
away
the
right
of
a
man
to
be
considered
the
equal
of
every
other
man.
i
understood
that
this
poor
man
in
the
court
is
exact
the
same
rights
as
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
he?
he
ends
up
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
i'm
talking
about
those
who
have
been
convicted,
the
class
i'm
talking
about
are
those
who
have
committed
a
crime,
been
tried
and
convicted,
and
you
singled
out
of
that
class
the
paupers,
and
give
him
special
treatment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
assume
that
recidivist
is
a
recidivist
because
he
wants
to
be
and
did
it
deliberately.
i
can
assume
that
for
a
pauper.
