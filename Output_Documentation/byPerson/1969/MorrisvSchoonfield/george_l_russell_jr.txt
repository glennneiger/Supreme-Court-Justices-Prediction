mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
is
correct.
the
first
argument
are
intend
to
make
is
that
this
case
is
moot
in
light
of
the
statute
recently
passed
by
the
maryland
legislature
as
an
emergency
bill
in
title
chapter
147
and
it
was
signed
by
governor
mandel
on
the
15th
of
april.
this
statute
under
section
6
is
retroactive
in
its
application
and
therefore,
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellants
in
this
case
may
take
advantage
of
it.
it
provides
that
any
person
incarcerated
for
default
of
payment
of
a
fine
may
apply
for
a
hearing
or
by
general
order
of
the
court
may
have
a
hearing
on
his
indigent
status.
the
court
after
conducting
an
inquiry
if
it
finds
that
this
individual
is
unable
to
pay
the
fine
immediately,
the
court
may
provide
installment
payments.
if
the
court
finds
that
installment
payments
are
not
feasible
under
the
circumstances,
then
may
offer
to
the
defendant
substitute
punishment,
and
this
is
the
theory
under
which
maryland
has
enacted
its
legislation.
the
theory
that
there
must
be
an
alternative
punishment
appropriately
imposed
upon
a
defendant
upon
whom
financial
criminal
sanctions
would
have
no
relevancy.
and
in
this
case
in
the
maryland
statute,
the
court
cannot
impose
a
confinement
that
exceeds
$10.00
a
day.
that
is
to
state
that
the
--
if
the
fine
is
$500.00
and
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
is
indigent,
it
may
state
that
i
believe
that
one
day
in
jail
is
sufficient,
but
the
court
cannot
impose
a
sentence
which
would
exceed
$10.00
a
day;
that
is
the
minimum
that
it
can
allow.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
april
15th,
immediately
upon
signing
by
the
governor
and
that
is
the
reason
that
my
brother
anticipated
the
mootness
statute
because
we
propose
that
this
is
the
law
of
the
case
under
prior
supreme
court
rulings.
now
as
to
the
philosophy
under
which
their
substitute
punishment
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
they
have
this
remedy
available
to
him
upon
application
or
by
general
order
of
the
court.
that
is
to
say
the
statute
anticipates
that
perhaps
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
or
the
chief
judge
of
the
supreme
bench
of
baltimore
city
can
by
general
order
make
this
available
for
all
of
the
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
except
to
the
extent
that
substitute
punishment
as
a
philosophy
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
i
think
that
my
brother
is
arguing
that
the
whole
theory
of
substitute
punishment,
alternative
punishment
is
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
understood
that
my
brother
was
raising
the
issue
that
the
theory
of
substitute
punishment
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that
is
under
any
circumstances,
if
a
man
is
indigent
where
the
statute
only
provides
as
a
penalty
of
fine,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
give
as
an
alternative
punishment
to
an
indigent
man
confined
in
jail.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
these
petitioners
already
out
except
for
the
one
petitioner
who
is
serving
21
years
in
the
maryland
penitentiary,
and
he
alleges
that
he
will
have
difficulty
getting
parole
because
a
fine
is
been
imposed
upon
him.
well,
this
statute
provides
him
for
--
with
the
remedy
if
he
can
get
a
job
that
and
could
becoming
--
and
an
earnings
capacity
or
have
the
capacity
to
make
money,
he
could
be
afforded
the
installment
program.
but
the
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
this
is
the
fair
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
address
myself
to,
yes
sir.
now,
to
get
involve
with
the
theory
of
substitute
punishment,
i
think
one
must
view
first
of
all
the
function
of
the
state
of
maryland;
that
is
to
provide
sanctions
so
that
people
will
obey
its
criminal
laws.
now,
we've
created
the
class
of
people
in
maryland,
those
who
can
pay
fines
and
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
fines.
and
so
that
state
has
been
left
with
the
obligation
to
the
overwhelming
class
in
the
state,
the
law
abiding
citizens
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
to
protect
the
law
abiding
citizens
of
maryland
from
those
who
violate
the
laws
of
maryland
and
do
not
have
funds
or
intend
to
plead
poverty
as
a
defense
to
punishment.
maryland
in
its
judgment
has
stated
that
there
shall
be
a
substitute
punishment
or
alternative
punishment,
and
this
was
the
theory
of
judge
thompson's
majority
opinion,
and
the
statute
of
course
codified
it.
now,
to
the
extent
that
my
brother
feels
that
maryland
has
not
been
wise
in
its
judgment,
that
there
are
other
alternatives
that
the
state
of
maryland
could've
made,
that
may
have
been
better,
that
may
have
been
reach
the
problem
better.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
does
not
require
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
maryland
legislature
or
indeed
any
state
legislature
as
long
as
it
meets
the
requirement
of
the
constitution.
and
as
i
understand
it
and
i
propose
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
only
that
the
remedy
be
reasonable
and
that
it
be
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
and
in
this
case,
deterrence
of
criminal
activity
or
deterrence
of
the
violation
of
criminal
laws
is
a
legitimate
function
of
the
state,
and
we
believe
that
the
alternative
punishment
is
rationally
related
to
it
and
under
the
cases
that
this
law
should
be
upheld.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
the
problem
is
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
the
problem
as
i
view
it
sir,
is
what
sanctions
does
the
state
of
maryland
have
to
prevent
people
from
violating
the
laws?
now
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
may
well
be
the
result
if
the
court
finds
as
that
many
cases
upheld,
particularly
the
new
york
case
and
it's
been
suggested
in
a
washington
case
that
any
conclusion
that
the
alternative
punishment
theory
is
not
constitutional
would
cause
the
kind
of
irreparable
harm
what
would
result
from
imprisonment
for
everyone.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
imprisonment
results
a
irreparable
harm
to
anyone
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
that's
i
think
that
in
theory
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
the
answer
i
would
propose
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
the
same
punishment
for
all
people.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it
does
not
require
--
it
simply
requires
that
when
you
make
a
classification
of
a
group
of
people
that
this
classification
be
a
reasonable
one
in
that
the
--
it's
be
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
this
is
why
we're
here
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
supreme
court
case
that
has
stated
as
such
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
--
that
poor
people
can
be
made
a
class.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
oh,
we
have
the
authority
that
chief
judge
thompson
relied
on
the
privitera
case.
you
see,
the
approach
as
we
view
it
your
honor
is
whether
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
imposing
sanctions
on
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines.
we
simply
cannot
have
a
system
of
justice
which
would
call
for
charge
account
justice
where
by
a
man
would
violate
the
law
and
then
bleed
poverty
and
simply
tell
the
court
to
put
it
on
the
account,
and
this
is
what
exactly
would
result,
it
would
be
application
under
the
theory
that
has
been
offered
by
the
court
here.
the
equal
protection
clause
says
not
go
so
far,
that
is
our
position,
that
it's
impossible
to
equate
imprisonment
with
fines.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
a
sentence
may
it
please
the
court
is
not
being
imposed
upon
him
solely
because
he's
poor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it's
being
imposed
upon
him
because
he's
violated
the
law.
the
sanctions
available
to
him
under
the
law
are
useless
because
he
is
poor
and
therefore
the
state
of
maryland
had
provided
an
alternative
punishment.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
this
is
true,
but
i
do
not
view
this
as
being
such
a
disparity
as
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
under
the
statute,
he
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
justify
it
because
the
state
of
maryland
otherwise
would
be
powerless
to
impose
sanctions
upon
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines.
what
is
the
alternative?
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that's
just
true,
he
has
his
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
he
ends
up
in
jail
because
he
violated
the
law.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
we
give
special
treatment
to
other
people
also.
we
give
special
treatment
to
recidivists.
we
give
special
treatment
to
many
people
as
this
court
has
stated,
they're
many
factors
that
come
into
play.
poverty
is
one
factor
that
we
here
on
today,
but
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
would
concur
that
this
should
not
be
assumed
for
pauper.
man
is
poor
from
no
fault
but
his
own,
but
i
must
assume
that
he
willfully
violated
the
law
and
assuming
that
he
willfully
violated
the
law,
he
then
should
not
be
able
to
escape
or
be
able
to
elect
--
dictate
the
kind
of
punishment
he
uses,
or
as
to
incur
and
under
the
present
maryland
statute,
the
court
is
given
wide
latitude
as
to
the
amount
of
confinement.
for
instance,
in
the
case
where
the
statute
provides
only
a
fine
that
confinement
shall
not
be
more
than
15
days.
however,
it
can
be
shorter
time
as
the
judge
feels
in
his
wise
discretion
that
the
case
before
him
dictates.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
provided
in
the
statute
also.
the
commitment
of
a
man
is
the
last
alternative
that
the
court
has
before
it.
installment
payments
as
a
condition
of
probation,
payment
at
once
or
the
judge
in
his
discretion
and
i'm
speaking
now
where
the
statute
calls
only
for
fine
because
i
do
not
deal
with
the
problem
where
the
statute
provides
for
imprisonment,
and
the
court
and
as
the
alternative
makes
a
fine
and
commits
him.
our
statute
states
that
in
that
case,
he
shall
not
serve
more
than
one-third
of
the
term
provided
for
imprisonment
or
90
days
whichever
is
less.
but
the
problem
arises
of
course
in
the
case
where
only
a
fine
is
provided
as
a
penalty
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
offer
to
this
man
or
to
impose
upon
him
an
alternative
punishment
since
he
is
unable
because
of
his
poverty
which
obtained
about
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
presumably
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
to
no
fault
at
anyone.
now,
to
do
otherwise
would
be
asking
this
court
or
would
as
i
believe
the
--
to
ask
--
the
appellants
would
be
asking
this
court
to
correct
every
inequity
that
existed
in
our
society
because
of
the
poverty
that's
there.
and
while
this
is
a
praise
worthy
objective,
i
think
it's
the
function
--
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
function
of
the
court
to
interject
and
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
maryland
legislature
how
the
poor
the
court
may
believe
it
they
have
been
expressed.
although,
i
submit
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
enlightening
statute
in
the
nation
insofar
as
the
punishment
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
the
cases
have
held
and
this
court
has
held
many
times
before
that
the
court
simply
will
not
substitute
its
judgment.
now,
the
sole
question
therefore
as
i
view
it
is
whether
the
alternative
punishment
theory
is
constitutional,
not
whether
--
it
is
the
best
alternative
that
could
be
offered,
but
whether
it
is
a
meet
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
i
say
that
it
does
because
it's
a
reasonable
classification,
and
secondly
because
it
is
related
directly
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
court
asked
in
the
prior
case
about
some
statistics,
and
i
thought
that
i
would
offer
to
the
court.
in
maryland,
there
are
99,000
traffic
case
is
tried
in
one
year.
now,
that
is
in
baltimore
city
and
out
of
the
199,000,
157
were
committed
in
default
of
payment
of
fines.
now,
we
view
it
or
offer
that
it's
less
than
0.3
%
of
those
cases
tried
that
people
are
incarcerated
because
they
cannot
pay
the
fines.
in
some
cases
in
the
criminal
courts
of
course,
people
are
committed
into
fault
to
payment
of
fines,
and
then
suddenly,
the
money
arrives.
and
they
of
course
are
given
credit
for
the
time
that
they've
served
and
the
balance
is
paid
and
their
release
is
effective.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
think
that
the
statistics
of
traffic
violators
would
be
lower.
i
think,
more
people
are
committed
a
default
to
fines
in
the
criminal
court
than
would
be
in
the
traffic
court.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
this
is
true.
i
think
that
is
the
direct
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
normally
if
a
man
is
able
to
own
an
automobile
or
he's
driving
one,
usually
in
99.9%
of
the
cases
at
least
in
maryland,
i
n
baltimore
city,
they'll
come
up
with
the
money
with
the
fine.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
0.3
%
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
was
traffic.
non-traffic,
the
statistics
are
bit
different.
now,
figures
here
are
indicate
that
in
the
six-month
period,
2048
individuals
where
committed
in
the
criminal
court
for
default
of
payment
of
fines.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it's
about
4%.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
my
brother
has
indicated
in
his
brief
that
he
felt
that
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
violated
as
well
as
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
and
just
to
--
because
i
only
have
one
appearance
here,
i
would
like
to
state
that
vis-a-vis
these
cases
that
we
feel
that
the
maryland
statute
that
we
believe
was
the
law
of
the
case
now,
in
anyway
violates
either
those
amendments
to
the
constitution.
involuntary
servitude
or
slavery
or
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
or
nor
do
we
have
the
problem
of
excessive
fines
here.
all
of
the
fines
imposed
are
within
the
statutory
limits
and
i
simply
want
to
acknowledge
that
we
have
reacted
to
this
argument
in
our
briefs,
and
we'd
be
prepared
to
answer
any
questions
on
those
particular
issues.
but
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
feel
viewed
in
its
totality
and
viewing
the
function
and
the
duty
that's
states
that
have
to
its
individual
inhabitants
to
impose
sanctions
upon
individuals
and
to
determine
the
need
to
have
sanctions
and
that
this
statutes
meets
the
constitutional
burden
to
the
extent
that
it
provides
an
alternative
punishment
for
individuals
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines,
and
that
this
alternative
punishment
theory
meets
all
of
the
requirements
in
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
is
correct.
the
first
argument
are
intend
to
make
is
that
this
case
is
moot
in
light
of
the
statute
recently
passed
by
the
maryland
legislature
as
an
emergency
bill
in
title
chapter
147
and
it
was
signed
by
governor
mandel
on
the
15th
of
april.
this
statute
under
section
6
is
retroactive
in
its
application
and
therefore,
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellants
in
this
case
may
take
advantage
of
it.
it
provides
that
any
person
incarcerated
for
default
of
payment
of
a
fine
may
apply
for
a
hearing
or
by
general
order
of
the
court
may
have
a
hearing
on
his
indigent
status.
the
court
after
conducting
an
inquiry
if
it
finds
that
this
individual
is
unable
to
pay
the
fine
immediately,
the
court
may
provide
installment
payments.
if
the
court
finds
that
installment
payments
are
not
feasible
under
the
circumstances,
then
may
offer
to
the
defendant
substitute
punishment,
and
this
is
the
theory
under
which
maryland
has
enacted
its
legislation.
the
theory
that
there
must
be
an
alternative
punishment
appropriately
imposed
upon
a
defendant
upon
whom
financial
criminal
sanctions
would
have
no
relevancy.
and
in
this
case
in
the
maryland
statute,
the
court
cannot
impose
a
confinement
that
exceeds
$10.00
a
day.
that
is
to
state
that
the
--
if
the
fine
is
$500.00
and
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
is
indigent,
it
may
state
that
i
believe
that
one
day
in
jail
is
sufficient,
but
the
court
cannot
impose
a
sentence
which
would
exceed
$10.00
a
day;
that
is
the
minimum
that
it
can
allow.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
april
15th,
immediately
upon
signing
by
the
governor
and
that
is
the
reason
that
my
brother
anticipated
the
mootness
statute
because
we
propose
that
this
is
the
law
of
the
case
under
prior
supreme
court
rulings.
now
as
to
the
philosophy
under
which
their
substitute
punishment
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
they
have
this
remedy
available
to
him
upon
application
or
by
general
order
of
the
court.
that
is
to
say
the
statute
anticipates
that
perhaps
the
chief
judge
of
the
municipal
court
or
the
chief
judge
of
the
supreme
bench
of
baltimore
city
can
by
general
order
make
this
available
for
all
of
the
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
except
to
the
extent
that
substitute
punishment
as
a
philosophy
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
i
think
that
my
brother
is
arguing
that
the
whole
theory
of
substitute
punishment,
alternative
punishment
is
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
understood
that
my
brother
was
raising
the
issue
that
the
theory
of
substitute
punishment
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that
is
under
any
circumstances,
if
a
man
is
indigent
where
the
statute
only
provides
as
a
penalty
of
fine,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
give
as
an
alternative
punishment
to
an
indigent
man
confined
in
jail.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
these
petitioners
already
out
except
for
the
one
petitioner
who
is
serving
21
years
in
the
maryland
penitentiary,
and
he
alleges
that
he
will
have
difficulty
getting
parole
because
a
fine
is
been
imposed
upon
him.
well,
this
statute
provides
him
for
--
with
the
remedy
if
he
can
get
a
job
that
and
could
becoming
--
and
an
earnings
capacity
or
have
the
capacity
to
make
money,
he
could
be
afforded
the
installment
program.
but
the
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
this
is
the
fair
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
address
myself
to,
yes
sir.
now,
to
get
involve
with
the
theory
of
substitute
punishment,
i
think
one
must
view
first
of
all
the
function
of
the
state
of
maryland;
that
is
to
provide
sanctions
so
that
people
will
obey
its
criminal
laws.
now,
we've
created
the
class
of
people
in
maryland,
those
who
can
pay
fines
and
those
who
are
too
poor
to
pay
fines.
and
so
that
state
has
been
left
with
the
obligation
to
the
overwhelming
class
in
the
state,
the
law
abiding
citizens
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
to
protect
the
law
abiding
citizens
of
maryland
from
those
who
violate
the
laws
of
maryland
and
do
not
have
funds
or
intend
to
plead
poverty
as
a
defense
to
punishment.
maryland
in
its
judgment
has
stated
that
there
shall
be
a
substitute
punishment
or
alternative
punishment,
and
this
was
the
theory
of
judge
thompson's
majority
opinion,
and
the
statute
of
course
codified
it.
now,
to
the
extent
that
my
brother
feels
that
maryland
has
not
been
wise
in
its
judgment,
that
there
are
other
alternatives
that
the
state
of
maryland
could've
made,
that
may
have
been
better,
that
may
have
been
reach
the
problem
better.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
does
not
require
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
maryland
legislature
or
indeed
any
state
legislature
as
long
as
it
meets
the
requirement
of
the
constitution.
and
as
i
understand
it
and
i
propose
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
only
that
the
remedy
be
reasonable
and
that
it
be
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
and
in
this
case,
deterrence
of
criminal
activity
or
deterrence
of
the
violation
of
criminal
laws
is
a
legitimate
function
of
the
state,
and
we
believe
that
the
alternative
punishment
is
rationally
related
to
it
and
under
the
cases
that
this
law
should
be
upheld.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
the
problem
is
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
the
problem
as
i
view
it
sir,
is
what
sanctions
does
the
state
of
maryland
have
to
prevent
people
from
violating
the
laws?
now
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
may
well
be
the
result
if
the
court
finds
as
that
many
cases
upheld,
particularly
the
new
york
case
and
it's
been
suggested
in
a
washington
case
that
any
conclusion
that
the
alternative
punishment
theory
is
not
constitutional
would
cause
the
kind
of
irreparable
harm
what
would
result
from
imprisonment
for
everyone.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
imprisonment
results
a
irreparable
harm
to
anyone
in
my
judgment
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
that's
i
think
that
in
theory
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
the
answer
i
would
propose
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
the
same
punishment
for
all
people.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it
does
not
require
--
it
simply
requires
that
when
you
make
a
classification
of
a
group
of
people
that
this
classification
be
a
reasonable
one
in
that
the
--
it's
be
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
this
is
why
we're
here
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
supreme
court
case
that
has
stated
as
such
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
--
that
poor
people
can
be
made
a
class.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
oh,
we
have
the
authority
that
chief
judge
thompson
relied
on
the
privitera
case.
you
see,
the
approach
as
we
view
it
your
honor
is
whether
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
imposing
sanctions
on
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines.
we
simply
cannot
have
a
system
of
justice
which
would
call
for
charge
account
justice
where
by
a
man
would
violate
the
law
and
then
bleed
poverty
and
simply
tell
the
court
to
put
it
on
the
account,
and
this
is
what
exactly
would
result,
it
would
be
application
under
the
theory
that
has
been
offered
by
the
court
here.
the
equal
protection
clause
says
not
go
so
far,
that
is
our
position,
that
it's
impossible
to
equate
imprisonment
with
fines.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
a
sentence
may
it
please
the
court
is
not
being
imposed
upon
him
solely
because
he's
poor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it's
being
imposed
upon
him
because
he's
violated
the
law.
the
sanctions
available
to
him
under
the
law
are
useless
because
he
is
poor
and
therefore
the
state
of
maryland
had
provided
an
alternative
punishment.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
this
is
true,
but
i
do
not
view
this
as
being
such
a
disparity
as
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
under
the
statute,
he
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
justify
it
because
the
state
of
maryland
otherwise
would
be
powerless
to
impose
sanctions
upon
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines.
what
is
the
alternative?
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that's
just
true,
he
has
his
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
he
ends
up
in
jail
because
he
violated
the
law.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
we
give
special
treatment
to
other
people
also.
we
give
special
treatment
to
recidivists.
we
give
special
treatment
to
many
people
as
this
court
has
stated,
they're
many
factors
that
come
into
play.
poverty
is
one
factor
that
we
here
on
today,
but
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
would
concur
that
this
should
not
be
assumed
for
pauper.
man
is
poor
from
no
fault
but
his
own,
but
i
must
assume
that
he
willfully
violated
the
law
and
assuming
that
he
willfully
violated
the
law,
he
then
should
not
be
able
to
escape
or
be
able
to
elect
--
dictate
the
kind
of
punishment
he
uses,
or
as
to
incur
and
under
the
present
maryland
statute,
the
court
is
given
wide
latitude
as
to
the
amount
of
confinement.
for
instance,
in
the
case
where
the
statute
provides
only
a
fine
that
confinement
shall
not
be
more
than
15
days.
however,
it
can
be
shorter
time
as
the
judge
feels
in
his
wise
discretion
that
the
case
before
him
dictates.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
provided
in
the
statute
also.
the
commitment
of
a
man
is
the
last
alternative
that
the
court
has
before
it.
installment
payments
as
a
condition
of
probation,
payment
at
once
or
the
judge
in
his
discretion
and
i'm
speaking
now
where
the
statute
calls
only
for
fine
because
i
do
not
deal
with
the
problem
where
the
statute
provides
for
imprisonment,
and
the
court
and
as
the
alternative
makes
a
fine
and
commits
him.
our
statute
states
that
in
that
case,
he
shall
not
serve
more
than
one-third
of
the
term
provided
for
imprisonment
or
90
days
whichever
is
less.
but
the
problem
arises
of
course
in
the
case
where
only
a
fine
is
provided
as
a
penalty
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
offer
to
this
man
or
to
impose
upon
him
an
alternative
punishment
since
he
is
unable
because
of
his
poverty
which
obtained
about
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
presumably
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
to
no
fault
at
anyone.
now,
to
do
otherwise
would
be
asking
this
court
or
would
as
i
believe
the
--
to
ask
--
the
appellants
would
be
asking
this
court
to
correct
every
inequity
that
existed
in
our
society
because
of
the
poverty
that's
there.
and
while
this
is
a
praise
worthy
objective,
i
think
it's
the
function
--
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
function
of
the
court
to
interject
and
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
maryland
legislature
how
the
poor
the
court
may
believe
it
they
have
been
expressed.
although,
i
submit
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
enlightening
statute
in
the
nation
insofar
as
the
punishment
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
the
cases
have
held
and
this
court
has
held
many
times
before
that
the
court
simply
will
not
substitute
its
judgment.
now,
the
sole
question
therefore
as
i
view
it
is
whether
the
alternative
punishment
theory
is
constitutional,
not
whether
--
it
is
the
best
alternative
that
could
be
offered,
but
whether
it
is
a
meet
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
i
say
that
it
does
because
it's
a
reasonable
classification,
and
secondly
because
it
is
related
directly
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
court
asked
in
the
prior
case
about
some
statistics,
and
i
thought
that
i
would
offer
to
the
court.
in
maryland,
there
are
99,000
traffic
case
is
tried
in
one
year.
now,
that
is
in
baltimore
city
and
out
of
the
199,000,
157
were
committed
in
default
of
payment
of
fines.
now,
we
view
it
or
offer
that
it's
less
than
0.3
%
of
those
cases
tried
that
people
are
incarcerated
because
they
cannot
pay
the
fines.
in
some
cases
in
the
criminal
courts
of
course,
people
are
committed
into
fault
to
payment
of
fines,
and
then
suddenly,
the
money
arrives.
and
they
of
course
are
given
credit
for
the
time
that
they've
served
and
the
balance
is
paid
and
their
release
is
effective.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
i
think
that
the
statistics
of
traffic
violators
would
be
lower.
i
think,
more
people
are
committed
a
default
to
fines
in
the
criminal
court
than
would
be
in
the
traffic
court.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
this
is
true.
i
think
that
is
the
direct
--
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
normally
if
a
man
is
able
to
own
an
automobile
or
he's
driving
one,
usually
in
99.9%
of
the
cases
at
least
in
maryland,
i
n
baltimore
city,
they'll
come
up
with
the
money
with
the
fine.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
0.3
%
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
that
was
traffic.
non-traffic,
the
statistics
are
bit
different.
now,
figures
here
are
indicate
that
in
the
six-month
period,
2048
individuals
where
committed
in
the
criminal
court
for
default
of
payment
of
fines.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
it's
about
4%.
mr.
george
l.
russell,
jr.
well,
my
brother
has
indicated
in
his
brief
that
he
felt
that
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
constitution
was
violated
as
well
as
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
and
just
to
--
because
i
only
have
one
appearance
here,
i
would
like
to
state
that
vis-a-vis
these
cases
that
we
feel
that
the
maryland
statute
that
we
believe
was
the
law
of
the
case
now,
in
anyway
violates
either
those
amendments
to
the
constitution.
involuntary
servitude
or
slavery
or
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
or
nor
do
we
have
the
problem
of
excessive
fines
here.
all
of
the
fines
imposed
are
within
the
statutory
limits
and
i
simply
want
to
acknowledge
that
we
have
reacted
to
this
argument
in
our
briefs,
and
we'd
be
prepared
to
answer
any
questions
on
those
particular
issues.
but
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
feel
viewed
in
its
totality
and
viewing
the
function
and
the
duty
that's
states
that
have
to
its
individual
inhabitants
to
impose
sanctions
upon
individuals
and
to
determine
the
need
to
have
sanctions
and
that
this
statutes
meets
the
constitutional
burden
to
the
extent
that
it
provides
an
alternative
punishment
for
individuals
who
are
unable
to
pay
fines,
and
that
this
alternative
punishment
theory
meets
all
of
the
requirements
in
constitution.
thank
you.
