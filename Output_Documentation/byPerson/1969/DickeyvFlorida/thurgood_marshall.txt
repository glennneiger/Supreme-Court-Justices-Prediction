justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true
that
they
bring
him
back
to
the
nearest
federal
penitentiary?
the
federal
government
does
bring
him
and
close
to
the
county
as
possible
and
then
let's
the
county
come
and
pick
him
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
could
have
been
done
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
wouldn't
be
this
case
because
he
asked
eight
years,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
judge
say
that
i
will
not
do
this
because
you
have
absented
yourself
from
the
state
voluntarily?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
one
in
'55?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
no,
that's
right,
29th
of
october,
'62.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
well,
did
you
read
that
he
asked
that
above
named
respondent
to
permit
an
immediate
trial
in
order
to
enable
your
petitioner
to
properly
protest
his
right
as
guaranteed
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
asked
-–
if
this
is
the
way
he's
asked,
was
any
doubt
that
when
you
read
this
that
he's
asking
for
a
speedy
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
really?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
was
he
at
50
--
what
was
it,
'62?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't'
one
of
them
filed
while
he
was
still
in
florida?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
federal
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
counsel
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right
when
he
was
taken
about
--when
he
was
at
marianna,
the
state
could
have
taken
him
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
permission
of
the
federal
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
where
was
he
tried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
that,
couldn't
the
state
have
asked
for
those
crimes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
prosecute
him.
they
could
have
asked
him
right
then
and
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
speedy
means
speedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is,
the
old
question
was,
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
was
taken
out
of
the
state
by
the
federal
authorities.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
asking
you,
couldn't
the
state
have
said
to
the
federal
authorities,
leave
him
here
so
we
can
try
him
on
our
charge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
don't
have
to
accept
the
warrant.
i'm
saying,
the
local
procedure
which
is
set
out
in
smith
and
hooey
of
how
you
get
a
federal
prisoner.
and
it's
undisputed,
they
were
never
asked
for
the
federal
authorities
have
turned
the
prisoner
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
it,
you
allowed
--
the
eight
years
would
allow
that
the
federal
feature
took
it
out
of
the
state
and
that's
true
among
the
01
instead
of
02,
instead
of
01.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
here,
he
did
ask
three
different
times.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that
he
didn't
do?
he
didn't
come
there
in
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
that
is
to
let
this
court
know
that
you
are
pushing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
the
prosecution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
a
point,
the
judge
never
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
piece
of
paper
didn't
comply
with
the
florida
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
