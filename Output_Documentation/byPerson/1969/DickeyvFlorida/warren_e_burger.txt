the

case
heard.
mr.
buchanan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
under
your
statute
as
you
described
the
sheriff
has
got
the
power
to
told.
the
statute
just
by
holding
a
warrant
and
deliberately
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
defendant
is
within
the
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
party
could
have
had
him
any
time
they
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
regular
extradition
process
if
he
is
a
person
in
custody?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
eight
years
is
enough
time
lapse
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
any
prejudice
at
all
or
prejudice
should
be
presumed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
georgieff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
help
me
write
at
the
outsets
if
you
could,
just
some
sort
you
got
the
fact
picture
before
us.
if
you'd
suggest
what
to
-–
what
reasons
that
were,
if
any
impediments
that
were
at
florida
in
getting
this
man
out
of
the
penitentiary
and
bringing
him
back
for
trial.
did
florida
try
to
do
in
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
frustrated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
suggest
any
hypothesis
as
to
why
this
was
not
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
'62
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
got
it
then,
he
might
not
be
complaining
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
speak
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
referring
to
the
time
factor
counsel.
i
thought
i
remembered
one
english
case
which
is
cited
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
recent
years
in
which
they
held
that
two
years.
it
wasn't
inherently
oppressed
at
the
time
beyond
which,
there
could
be
no
delay
without
per
se
prejudice.
i
hear
that
you've
got
eight
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
does
that
state
of
florida
have
any
hypothesis
as
to
why
they
could
not
have
brought
him
back
and
tried
him
promptly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
but
isn't
--
apart
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
and
any
in
the
speedy
trial
provisons
didn't
it
just
simply
basic
sound
administration
in
prosecutions
to
try
these
cases
promptly
and
get
them
out
of
the
way?
i'm
frankly
very
puzzled
by
the
delay
of
that
length.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
eight
years
look
like
a
delay?
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
undertaking
the
tax
you
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
either
you
could
offer
a
hypothesis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
a
signal
to
the
court
that
he
wanted
a
trial
each
time
they
heard
from
him,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
the
prosecutor
hasn't
control.
you
say
that
there's
been
an
inherent
power
and
a
corresponding
duty
on
the
court
to
see
that
cases
are
tried
promptly
no
matter
what
the
prosecutor
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
has
got
the
power
but
the
prosecutor
doesn't,
he
would
just
call
him
and
say
put
this
case
down
next
term
or
i'll
dismiss
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
your
position
that
this
right
didn't
really
attach
--
put
any
duties
on
the
state
of
florida
until
the
court
spoke
in
klopfer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
he
incarcerated
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
sentence
is
terminated
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
doesn't
seem
to
agree
with
you.
perhaps,
you
will
clear
it
that
up
later
with
him
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
was
the
sentence
in
florida?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
have
your
point
on
that.
we
have
your
point
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
buchanan,
would
you
clear,
where
is
the
defendant
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
will
begin
to
serve
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nine
more
years
minimum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
the
klopfer
that's
retroactive
or
the
constitution
itself
in
the
sense
that
if
klopfer
have
not
been
decided,
he
had
this
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
this
is
a
semantical
difference,
but
in
this
court,
it's
an
important
--

e.
