justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there's
a
statute
limitations
for
robbery
in
florida,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
told
when
he's
out
of
the
state.
and
when
does
it
begin
to
run,
at
the
time
of
the
indictment
or
at
the
time
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
told?
justice
potter
stewart
told,
as
i
understand
that
word
means
it's
suspended,
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
stops
running?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
you
say
it's
told
when
the
warrant
as
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hand,
i
don't
understand
really.
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
does
it
begin
to
run
in
florida,
at
the
time
of
the
indictment
ordinarily,
forget
this
case,
just
--
let's
talk
about
an
ordinary
robbery
case
in
florida
when
the
man
presumably
remains
in
florida.
what
is
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations?
how
many
years?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
does
it
begin
to
run?
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
the
ordinary
case,
within
two
years
after
the
offense
is
committed,
the
warrant
has
to
be
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hands?
justice
potter
stewart
his
absence
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn't
the
sister
to
whom
he
allegedly
made
a
telephone
call?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
before
that,
this
judge
even
if
he
complied
with
florida
statutory
provisions
would
have
said,
well,
later
it
will
apply
to
you
because
you're
a
prisoner
outside.
