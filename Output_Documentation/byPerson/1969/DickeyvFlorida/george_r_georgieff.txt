mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
they
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
secure
his
return
until
after
the
decision
in
dickey
was
rendered
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
none
whatsoever.
at
that
time,
mr.
dickey
petitioned
on
a
mandamus
proceeding
to
say
look,
make
it
or
miss.
either
get
me
back
down
there
and
try
me,
or
get
this
detainer
off
my
back
so
that
i
can
get
parole
from
the
federal
authorities.
now,
that's
the
posture
which
he
put
his
pleading
and
in
light
thereof,
they
issued
their
opinion
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
here.
on
that
occasion,
mr.
hopkins,
the
state
attorney,
secured
an
order
to
have
mr.
dickey
return
for
purposes
of
trial.
he
was
brought
back
and
as
mr.
buchanan
explained,
the
results
that
follow
did
follow.
now
on
the
first
occasion
when
an
attempt
was
made
with
the
federal
authorities
to
get
him
back,
they
complied
and
we
did
get
him
back,
tried
and
convicted
him
and
he
sits
in
(inaudible).
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
and
back
home
again
i
guess
yes,
it
does.
now,
the
question
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
only
because
there
was
no
duty
to
do
it
constitutionally,
either
at
the
state
or
federal
level.
until
dickey
in
florida
and
klopfer
here,
there
was
never
any
commandment
that
you
do
this.
now,
there
were
times
when
you
approved
cases
in
which
a
complaint
was
made
regarding
a
speedy
trial
at
the
federal
level.
there
were
times
when
you
disapproved
them,
but
you
never
did
it
under
a
constitutional
mandate.
florida
never
did
it
until
dickey,
and
that's
why
i
took
the
position
of
judge
taylor
to
whom
these
complaints
were
brought,
and
i
call
them
complaints
because
they
weren't
demands
for
a
speedy
trial.
i
call
them
complaints
and
i
say
that
he
was
not
in
error
is
because
as
occurred
with
gideon,
many
people
bore
the
brunt
of
that
who
perhaps
properly
didn't
deserve
it.
now,
that's
neither
here
or
there;
it's
done.
but
it's
a
little
unfair
to
say
to
somebody
you
should've
done
this
because
you
were
compelled
by
law
to
do
it
when
even
you
haven't
said
that
that
was
the
case.
now,
i
am
sure
that
judge
taylor
doesn't
need
my
personal
protection,
don't
misunderstand,
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
man
having
a
right,
i
say
that
it
came
into
being
first
when
you
rendered
your
decision
in
klopfer
and
then
when
dickey
acknowledged
that
out
of
our
supreme
court
said
now
in
light
of
klopfer,
it
is
now
a
situation
where
when
you
do
make
a
demand,
we
are
saying
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
'68.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
i
don't
have
to
mislead
you
about
that.
i
can't
hide
behind
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
can't
say
that
mr.
justice
harlan
because
how
do
i
explain
those
situations
in
which
you
did
grant
relief
before
klopfer
you
see?
now,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
suppose
we
have
a
gross
situation
of
a
man
who
committed
a
crime
some
20
odd
years
ago
and
through
some
dodge
of
one
kind
or
another,
and
he
lived
in
asylum
pure
life
and
between
it,
it
was
brought
to
you
on
very
painful
circumstances.
i
remember
of
myself
from
losses
that
i've
suffered
here
myself
that
as
often
is
not
these
things
have
an
effect
on
the
decision
making
process.
after
all,
when
it
is
a
gross
situation,
the
state
is
fair
game
and
perhaps
they
should
be
since
they
do
have
the
power.
but
when
you
do
have
situations
like
that,
you
haven't
backed
away
from
it.
i
simply
submit
that
klopfer
was
not
retroactive
and
ought
not
to
be
because
if
we
don't
go
to
that
situation,
then
the
situation
becomes
one
in
which
everybody
will
say,
“well
now
look,
you
got
me
in
jail
as
a
fourth
time
loser
and
the
last
three
times,
it
was
four-and-a-half
years
before
they
tried
me.
i
have
a
right
to
be
out
and
you've
got
to
remove
the
stigma,
the
fourth
time
loser,
and
the
life
sentence
by
the
way,
which
is
enhanced
penalty
in
florida.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
was
a
part
of
the
order
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
that's
not
the
predicate
for
his
conclusion.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
contains
three
writings
mr.
justice
black
and
i
don't
call
them
demands
because
i
don't
think
they
are.
it
contains
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
he
puts
it
in
the
alternative.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
bring
me
back
or
take
away
the
detainer,
one
of
them
he
says,
“try
me
or
release
me.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
black,
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
reading.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
that's
the
one
that
would
be
pertinent
to
your
inquiry,
i
think.
i'll
read
you
the
others
if
you
like.
your
petitioner
now
moves
and
phrases
honorable
court
to
cause
petitioner
to
be
brought
to
appear
before
it
by
means
of
the
proper
process
of
the
law,
namely
a
writ
arising
out
of
this
court
ordering
petitioner
before
it
for
a
trial
by
jury
or
that
an
order
be
issued
dismissing
said
charge.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
was
on
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
29th
of
october,
'62,
that
was
his
first
one,
30
months
after
he
went
to
jail.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
it
is.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
said
there
was
one
of
the
three.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
'55?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
this
didn't
occur
until
1960
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
just
the
one
i
read
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
except
that
it
wasn't
guaranteed
until
klopfer.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
now,
i've
got
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
91502,
and
if
i
am,
then
there
is
considerable
doubt.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
after
all,
let's
say
we
have
a
paid
defendant
and
he's
hired
counsel
who's
very
expensive
and
very
good
and
very
efficient.
no
court
would
suffer
the
man
that
complained
about
a
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
unless
he
met
the
requirements
of
91502.
i
submit
that
dickey
is
not
a
super
class
citizen
just
because
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
now,
if
we
hold
the
pace
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
was
in
leavenworth
or
alcatraz,
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
so,
that
wasn't
an
alternative.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copied
that
paragraph.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copy
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copied
that
paragraph.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
that
one
was
right
on
the
book
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
turn,
the
first
one
was
28
days
late.
the
third
one
spanned
36
months
before
he
made
it
after
having
made
the
second
one.
now
i
ask
you,
he
talks
about
prejudice.
i
don't
mean
to
question
you
of
course
but
i
ask
the
question.
where
is
the
prejudice
if
he
waits
30
months
before
he
makes
his
first
demand
if
the
passage
of
time
is
what
we're
asked
to
believe
as
the
predicate?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
a
fact,
and
if
he
got
the
third
time
running,
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
had
any
trouble
coming
here,
or
if
he'd
raised
it
by
prohibition,
he
wouldn't
be
sitting
in
raifordre
for
today.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
didn't
know
about
what
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
had
a
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
understand
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
i
don't
put
it
on
the
basis
of
that
they
have
no
way
in
which
they
could.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
obviously,
if
they
didn't,
we
wouldn't
even
be
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it
depends
on
whether
we
call
it
a
delay.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it's
an
interval
--
it's
an
interval
with
which
i
would
rather
not
be
saddled
but
i
am.
i
didn't
make
it
just
as
mr.
buchanan
inherited
the
situation
as
it
came.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
perhaps,
i
can
put
it
this
way
and
make
it
a
little
more
palatable,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
by
all
means,
go
ahead
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know.
that's
a
good
question.
december
15,
1967
is
when
the
information
was
filed
by
the
state
attorney.
that
means
that
it
was
tried
within
55
days
of
that
charge.
now,
comes
the
question
of
what
are
we
talking
about.
are
we
talking
about
july
1,
1960
or
are
we
talking
about
december
15,
1967?
i
cannot
resolve
that
for
you.
all
i
can
do
is
tell
you
that
if
dickey
had
been
brought
back
in
1963,
what
would
he
have
been
brought
back
to?
i'll
tell
you
what
--
award
that
had
never
even
been
served
on
him
by
the
u.s.
marshal.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
i
think
of
mr.
buchanan
as
to
statute
of
limitations.
well,
all
the
replies
are
accurate,
except
that
when
it's
served,
is
when
the
thing
goes
into
effect
for
purposes
of
tolling
the
statute.
now,
they
gave
it
to
the
u.s.
marshal.
he
declined
to
take
it
at
marianna
where
they
were
keeping
him
as
a
federal
prisoner
on
the
malone
bank
robbery.
he
said,
“wait
until
we
get
him
assigned
to
a
federal
institution
after
his
plea.
then
you
send
it
in
and,
then
we'll
serve
it
on.”
lo
and
behold,
that's
what
they
did
but
nobody
ever
served
it
on
him.
they
simply
put
it
in
his
file
as
a
detainer
and
that
made
the
predicate
for
the
complaint
that
he
wanted
to
get
out
from
under
that
detainer
and
subject
himself
to
parole
if
the
federal
authorities
were
going
to
give
it
to
him.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
they
could
not
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
because
he
was
being
held
for
trial
by
the
federal
authorities
on
the
malone
bank
robbery.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
that
charge?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
assume
in
marianna.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
now,
they
asked
to
serve
the
warrant
on
him
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
now,
you're
talking
about
within
10
days.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
how
about
one
day?
i'm
not
being
funny
but
really,
we
got
a
statute
that
says
three
terms
of
court,
presumably
unless
you
strike
it
down
as
being
oppressive,
if
we
meet
that,
we're
at
business.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
understand
sir,
but
they
didn't
because
the
federal
authorities
wouldn't
even
accept
the
warrant
for
service
on
demand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i'm
stuck
with
the
fact
that
that
wasn't
done
no
matter
what
our
positions,
where
he
becomes
is
what
we
did
a
constitutional
deprivation
of
a
right
that
you
recognized
in
klopfer
or
isn't
it?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
but
imply
but,
it
would
have
been
02
all
the
same
if
he
were
a
prisoner
not
in
federal
custody,
it
simply
has
to
do
with
one
at
liberty
or
one
in
custody
you
see.
and
that
my
point
that
up
because
we
have
a
case
called
lloyd
versus
grayson
and
it's
possibly
eight
or
nine
years
old,
maybe
a
little
older
in
which
a
man
out
on
bond
complained
because
he
hadn't
been
tried
in
25
terms
of
court.
and
they
said,
look
man,
if
you
didn't
make
a
complaint
about
it,
when
you
are
out
enjoying
your
liberty
and
the
custody
(inaudible),
you
can't
be
heard
to
complain
about
it.
i
don't
rely
on
that,
you
know,
but
the
difference
is
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
but
he
did
it
badly
and
not
in
accord
with
the
law.
i've
got
nothing
left
but
that.
now,
either
he
is
required
to
follow
that
or
he
is
not,
i
contend
that
just
because
he
is
in
a
federal
penitentiary,
doesn't
excuse
him
from
complying
with
it,
especially
since
he
waited
30
months
before
he
complained
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
91502
says,
within
30
days
of
the
first
day
of
each
term
of
the
court
in
which
you're
going
to
be
tried,
you
file
a
demand
for
a
speedy
trial,
serving
a
copy
on
prosecution
for
each
of
three
successive
terms,
and
if
they
don't
do
it,
you're
home
free.
now,
he
didn't
do
that.
now,
that's
not
an
oppressive
requirement,
not
of
him
or
anybody
else.
nobody
says
you
have
to
do
it
in
beautiful
words
in
this
or
that
setting,
just
do
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
the
prosecution
not
the
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
the
court
doesn't
decide
when
he
is
to
be
tried,
prosecution
does.
the
state
attorney
has
the
option
of
doing
it
or
not
and
the
court
can't
force
him
to
do
it
at
least
in
florida.
now,
that
may
sound
peculiar
but
in
the
last
analysis,
he
functions
pretty
much
as
a
grand
jury
does.
suppose
they
don't
want
to
indict.
no
court
can
make
him
indict.
and
that's
how
we
have
the
peculiar
situation.
that's
why
we
have
to
have
the
individual
advice
of
state
attorney
or
the
solicitor
as
the
case
maybe.
look,
i
am
pressing
for
a
trial
and
i
want
it
now
or
i
want
it
out
for
a
month,
that
puts
him
on
notice,
but
that
did
not
happen
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
spanning
some
seven
years
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
spanning
a
total
of
seven
years.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
man
is
complaining.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
went
to
the
circuit
court,
to
the
judge.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
in
all
three
instance
judge
hugh
taylor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
and
i'll
tell
you
why
that's
not
the
proper
vehicle.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
here
we
go.
we're
saying
that
whether
it's
proper
or
not
or
whether
it
was
timely
or
not,
why
are
we
bothering
with
answers,
we're
talking
about
eight
years.
we
could
lay
it
on
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
a
charge
can
be
filed
by
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
look,
they
can
lean
on
him.
of
course
they
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
occasion,
i'm
sure
that
they
have
at
least
i
know
that
i
have
been
done
and
properly
so
most
of
the
time.
but
i
don't
back
off
on
that.
the
point
is,
here's
the
man
complaining
and
he
says,
“look,
i
ought
to
have
a
speedy
trial.
the
first
thing
that
he
didn't
do
was
to
move
forward
when
he
could
have.
he
had
30
months
within
which
he
would
have
had
12
remaining.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
suppose
mr.
justice
black,
he'd
awaited
25
years
to
do
it
three
times.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
just
within
30
days
of
the
first
term
--
first
day
of
the
term.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
he
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
july
1,
1960.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
june
28,
i'm
sorry
and
that
was
served
on
the
first.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
was
lodged
with
the
u.s.
marshal's
office
in
marianna.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
because
it
--
no
return
made
on
it
had
been
served.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
will
argue
anything
that
i
think
i
can
use.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i'll
tell
you
this
very
simple.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
my
defense
is
very
simple
that
he
has
waived
his
right
to
complain
about
it
because
he
didn't
meet
the
requirements
of
91502.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
three
times
running,
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
what
the
statute
says
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
ran
over
quite
a
few
years
and
i
might
add
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
possible
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
trial
until
somebody
else
died.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
exactly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
virtually,
immediately.
they
acknowledged
what
you
said
in
klopfer
as
their
predicate,
said
alright
mr.
hopkins,
either
make
it
or
miss,
he
made
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon
--
well,
it
was
literally
an
automatic
reversal,
you
didn't
discuss
prejudice.
he
said
i
would
have
to
assume
that
you're
talking
about
the
delay
of
time.
it
becomes
a
commandment
under
the
sixth
amendment.
what
you
did
is
extended
protection.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
certainly,
the
sixth
amendment
was
there,
but
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
in
effect
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
of
course.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
a
fact
and
i
think
that
is
what
i
said
in
my
brief
that
klopfer
makes
no
difference
except
as
to
those
states
which
had
no
state
provision
regarding
speedy
trial.
that
gave
a
complaining
individual
a
right
to
come
to
you
with,
although
the
federal
violation
as
you
enunciated
it
in
klopfer.
until
you
did,
all
that
can
be
said
is
the
sixth
sat
there
until
you
decided
that
it
was
going
to
be
applied
to
the
state
through
the
fourteenth.
now,
i
don't
need
to
be
evasive
but
that's
what
i
understand
you
did
in
klopfer.
now,
if
he
didn't
meet
florida's
requirement
at
a
time
when
he
could
have
and
secured
his
relief
and
didn't
have
the
option
of
doing
it
under
klopfer
because
all
of
his
moves
had
been
made
by
then,
then
i
submit
that
our
court
was
not
in
error,
and
his
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
was
made
at
a
time
when
he
had
no
assurance
without
compliance
with
the
state
law
or
guarantee
under
the
federal
that
he
was
going
to
get
it
simply
by
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
once
again,
i
would
say
like
i
did
the
last
time
i
was
here
in
november,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
he
did
or
didn't
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
outcome
was
correct
whatever
his
reason.
now,
i
don't
like
to
say
that
on
one
side
top
and
bottom
on
the
other,
but
i
have
to
take
the
order
as
i
can
support
it
without
the
regard
of
what
he
said.
conceivably,
he
could
have
said
something
which
simply
didn't
make
any
legal
sense
and
it
might
never
less
have
been
a
good
order.
so,
very
simply
i
would
say,
we
talk
about
but
strickland
and
he
talks
about
prejudice
--
do
we
have
to
assume
that
if
but
strickland
was
there
to
testify
it,
he
wouldn't
be
complaining
about
the
loss
of
memory?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
waited
and
he
waited
conveniently.
now,
his
sister
died
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
until
his
third
one?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
first
one
was
in
'62,
30
months
after
he
was
jailed.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
about
29
months
--
30
months.
so,
he
wasn't
so
much
interested
in
a
speedy
trial
then.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
but
12
months
after
he
would've
been
out
for
(inaudible)
you
see.
three
terms
the
circuit
court
run
18
months.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
sure
did
know
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
filed
within
28
days
of
the
first
and,
then
on
the
button
on
the
second
and
almost
did
on
the
button
of
the
third.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
look,
i'm
assuming.
i
take
the
position
that
he
did
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
time
of
his
filing,
but
i
will
go
better
than
that.
suppose
that
he
didn't
know
it,
does
he
enjoy
a
better
status
because
he
doesn't
know
it?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
he
certainly
knew
enough
to
make
a
demand
for
a
trial
when
whatever
fashion
he
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
quite
enough
until
what
you
said
in
klopfer.
we
can
always
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct
at
the
federal
level.
now,
in
order
for
him
to
have
a
right
to
complain
about
a
federally
assured
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
i
contend
klopfer,
first
put
it
into
effect.
if
we
go
back
to
florida's
time,
then
he
didn't
comply
with
91502
and
the
court
so
stated
in
dickey
and
just
as
soon
as
they
said,
now
is
the
time
mr.
hopkins
for
you
to
move,
he
did
move
and
they
got
him
back.
and
55
days
later,
he
was
tried.
but
about
the
prohibition,
i
can't
stress
that
too
strongly.
if
it
was
a
fact
that
this
man
was
not
going
to
be
stuffed
with
flagging
memories
or
anything
like
that,
why
didn't
he
bring
prohibition
which
is
available
to
him?
he
says
that
the
result
would
be
automatic,
what
was
the
point
in
bringing
it?
well,
if
it
is
automatic,
then
that's
exactly
what
he
should
have
done.
there's
no
point
in
him
sitting
in
raiford
right
now
under
criminal
conviction
when
he
knew
what
the
outcome
would
be
and
could
come
to
you
and
say,
well
now
look
here,
they
denied
me
my
prohibition,
and
on
the
face
of
it,
i
was
entitled
of
a
speedy
trial
because
i
made
these
demands.
he
took
a
chance
and
he
lost
and
he
doesn't
like
it.
that
i
understand
but
it
doesn't
qualify
him
for
relief
under
the
status
of
the
cases
and
existence
of
the
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
raiford,
florida
state
penitentiary.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know
that
it
is
terminated.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
possible
that
they'll
send
him
back
for
the
federal
penitentiary,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
he
got
20
years.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
considering
the
majesty
of
their
order
in
dickey
and
i
was
on
short
end
of
that
one,
i
can
guarantee
you
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
without
regard
to
klopfer.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
all
i'm
doing
is
guessing
--
i
don't
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
he
did.
all
i
say
is
that
we
must
measure
it
on
the
pan
with
all
of
what
he
did
and
all
about
which
he
complains.
if
you
take
it
isolated,
of
course
he
qualifies.
who
wouldn't
like
to
come
to
you
and
say
eight
years?
come
on
--
i
think
those
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright,
i
contend
that
the
action
of
the
district
court
below
should
be
affirmed
or
at
least
this
case
should
not
be
reversed.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
they
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
secure
his
return
until
after
the
decision
in
dickey
was
rendered
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
none
whatsoever.
at
that
time,
mr.
dickey
petitioned
on
a
mandamus
proceeding
to
say
look,
make
it
or
miss.
either
get
me
back
down
there
and
try
me,
or
get
this
detainer
off
my
back
so
that
i
can
get
parole
from
the
federal
authorities.
now,
that's
the
posture
which
he
put
his
pleading
and
in
light
thereof,
they
issued
their
opinion
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
here.
on
that
occasion,
mr.
hopkins,
the
state
attorney,
secured
an
order
to
have
mr.
dickey
return
for
purposes
of
trial.
he
was
brought
back
and
as
mr.
buchanan
explained,
the
results
that
follow
did
follow.
now
on
the
first
occasion
when
an
attempt
was
made
with
the
federal
authorities
to
get
him
back,
they
complied
and
we
did
get
him
back,
tried
and
convicted
him
and
he
sits
in
(inaudible).
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
and
back
home
again
i
guess
yes,
it
does.
now,
the
question
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
only
because
there
was
no
duty
to
do
it
constitutionally,
either
at
the
state
or
federal
level.
until
dickey
in
florida
and
klopfer
here,
there
was
never
any
commandment
that
you
do
this.
now,
there
were
times
when
you
approved
cases
in
which
a
complaint
was
made
regarding
a
speedy
trial
at
the
federal
level.
there
were
times
when
you
disapproved
them,
but
you
never
did
it
under
a
constitutional
mandate.
florida
never
did
it
until
dickey,
and
that's
why
i
took
the
position
of
judge
taylor
to
whom
these
complaints
were
brought,
and
i
call
them
complaints
because
they
weren't
demands
for
a
speedy
trial.
i
call
them
complaints
and
i
say
that
he
was
not
in
error
is
because
as
occurred
with
gideon,
many
people
bore
the
brunt
of
that
who
perhaps
properly
didn't
deserve
it.
now,
that's
neither
here
or
there;
it's
done.
but
it's
a
little
unfair
to
say
to
somebody
you
should've
done
this
because
you
were
compelled
by
law
to
do
it
when
even
you
haven't
said
that
that
was
the
case.
now,
i
am
sure
that
judge
taylor
doesn't
need
my
personal
protection,
don't
misunderstand,
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
man
having
a
right,
i
say
that
it
came
into
being
first
when
you
rendered
your
decision
in
klopfer
and
then
when
dickey
acknowledged
that
out
of
our
supreme
court
said
now
in
light
of
klopfer,
it
is
now
a
situation
where
when
you
do
make
a
demand,
we
are
saying
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
'68.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
i
don't
have
to
mislead
you
about
that.
i
can't
hide
behind
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
can't
say
that
mr.
justice
harlan
because
how
do
i
explain
those
situations
in
which
you
did
grant
relief
before
klopfer
you
see?
now,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
suppose
we
have
a
gross
situation
of
a
man
who
committed
a
crime
some
20
odd
years
ago
and
through
some
dodge
of
one
kind
or
another,
and
he
lived
in
asylum
pure
life
and
between
it,
it
was
brought
to
you
on
very
painful
circumstances.
i
remember
of
myself
from
losses
that
i've
suffered
here
myself
that
as
often
is
not
these
things
have
an
effect
on
the
decision
making
process.
after
all,
when
it
is
a
gross
situation,
the
state
is
fair
game
and
perhaps
they
should
be
since
they
do
have
the
power.
but
when
you
do
have
situations
like
that,
you
haven't
backed
away
from
it.
i
simply
submit
that
klopfer
was
not
retroactive
and
ought
not
to
be
because
if
we
don't
go
to
that
situation,
then
the
situation
becomes
one
in
which
everybody
will
say,
“well
now
look,
you
got
me
in
jail
as
a
fourth
time
loser
and
the
last
three
times,
it
was
four-and-a-half
years
before
they
tried
me.
i
have
a
right
to
be
out
and
you've
got
to
remove
the
stigma,
the
fourth
time
loser,
and
the
life
sentence
by
the
way,
which
is
enhanced
penalty
in
florida.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
was
a
part
of
the
order
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
that's
not
the
predicate
for
his
conclusion.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
contains
three
writings
mr.
justice
black
and
i
don't
call
them
demands
because
i
don't
think
they
are.
it
contains
–-
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
he
puts
it
in
the
alternative.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
bring
me
back
or
take
away
the
detainer,
one
of
them
he
says,
“try
me
or
release
me.”
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
black,
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
reading.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
that's
the
one
that
would
be
pertinent
to
your
inquiry,
i
think.
i'll
read
you
the
others
if
you
like.
your
petitioner
now
moves
and
phrases
honorable
court
to
cause
petitioner
to
be
brought
to
appear
before
it
by
means
of
the
proper
process
of
the
law,
namely
a
writ
arising
out
of
this
court
ordering
petitioner
before
it
for
a
trial
by
jury
or
that
an
order
be

charge.

was
on

georgieff
29th
of
october,
'62,
that
was
his
first
one,
30
months
after
he
went
to
jail.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
it
is.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
said
there
was
one
of
the
three.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
'55?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
this
didn't
occur
until
1960
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
just
the
one
i
read
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
except
that
it
wasn't
guaranteed
until
klopfer.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
now,
i've
got
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
91502,
and
if
i
am,
then
there
is
considerable
doubt.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
after
all,
let's
say
we
have
a
paid
defendant
and
he's
hired
counsel
who's
very
expensive
and
very
good
and
very
efficient.
no
court
would
suffer
the
man
that
complained
about
a
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
unless
he
met
the
requirements
of
91502.
i
submit
that
dickey
is
not
a
super
class
citizen
just
because
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
now,
if
we
hold
the
pace
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
was
in
leavenworth
or
alcatraz,
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
so,
that
wasn't
an
alternative.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copied
that
paragraph.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copy
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
copied
that
paragraph.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
that
one
was
right
on
the
book
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
turn,
the
first
one
was
28
days
late.
the
third
one
spanned
36
months
before
he
made
it
after
having
made
the
second
one.
now
i
ask
you,
he
talks
about
prejudice.
i
don't
mean
to
question
you
of
course
but
i
ask
the
question.
where
is
the
prejudice
if
he
waits
30
months
before
he
makes
his
first
demand
if
the
passage
of
time
is
what
we're
asked
to
believe
as
the
predicate?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
a
fact,
and
if
he
got
the
third
time
running,
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
had
any
trouble
coming
here,
or
if
he'd
raised
it
by
prohibition,
he
wouldn't
be
sitting
in
raifordre
for
today.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
didn't
know
about
what
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
had
a
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
understand
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
sir,
i
don't
put
it
on
the
basis
of
that
they
have
no
way
in
which
they
could.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
obviously,
if
they
didn't,
we
wouldn't
even
be
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it
depends
on
whether
we
call
it
a
delay.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
it's
an
interval
--
it's
an
interval
with
which
i
would
rather
not
be
saddled
but
i
am.
i
didn't
make
it
just
as
mr.
buchanan
inherited
the
situation
as
it
came.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
perhaps,
i
can
put
it
this
way
and
make
it
a
little
more
palatable,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
by
all
means,
go
ahead
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know.
that's
a
good
question.
december
15,
1967
is
when
the
information
was
filed
by
the
state
attorney.
that
means
that
it
was
tried
within
55
days
of
that
charge.
now,
comes
the
question
of
what
are
we
talking
about.
are
we
talking
about
july
1,
1960
or
are
we
talking
about
december
15,
1967?
i
cannot
resolve
that
for
you.
all
i
can
do
is
tell
you
that
if
dickey
had
been
brought
back
in
1963,
what
would
he
have
been
brought
back
to?
i'll
tell
you
what
--
award
that
had
never
even
been
served
on
him
by
the
u.s.
marshal.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
i
think
of
mr.
buchanan
as
to
statute
of
limitations.
well,
all
the
replies
are
accurate,
except
that
when
it's
served,
is
when
the
thing
goes
into
effect
for
purposes
of
tolling
the
statute.
now,
they
gave
it
to
the
u.s.
marshal.
he
declined
to
take
it
at
marianna
where
they
were
keeping
him
as
a
federal
prisoner
on
the
malone
bank
robbery.
he
said,
“wait
until
we
get
him
assigned
to
a
federal
institution
after
his
plea.
then
you
send
it
in
and,
then
we'll
serve
it
on.”
lo
and
behold,
that's
what
they
did
but
nobody
ever
served
it
on
him.
they
simply
put
it
in
his
file
as
a
detainer
and
that
made
the
predicate
for
the
complaint
that
he
wanted
to
get
out
from
under
that
detainer
and
subject
himself
to
parole
if
the
federal
authorities
were
going
to
give
it
to
him.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
they
could
not
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
because
he
was
being
held
for
trial
by
the
federal
authorities
on
the
malone
bank
robbery.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
that
charge?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
assume
in
marianna.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
now,
they
asked
to
serve
the
warrant
on
him
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
now,
you're
talking
about
within
10
days.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
how
about
one
day?
i'm
not
being
funny
but
really,
we
got
a
statute
that
says
three
terms
of
court,
presumably
unless
you
strike
it
down
as
being
oppressive,
if
we
meet
that,
we're
at
business.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
understand
sir,
but
they
didn't
because
the
federal
authorities
wouldn't
even
accept
the
warrant
for
service
on
demand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i'm
stuck
with
the
fact
that
that
wasn't
done
no
matter
what
our
positions,
where
he
becomes
is
what
we
did
a
constitutional
deprivation
of
a
right
that
you
recognized
in
klopfer
or
isn't
it?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
but
imply
but,
it
would
have
been
02
all
the
same
if
he
were
a
prisoner
not
in
federal
custody,
it
simply
has
to
do
with
one
at
liberty
or
one
in
custody
you
see.
and
that
my
point
that
up
because
we
have
a
case
called
lloyd
versus
grayson
and
it's
possibly
eight
or
nine
years
old,
maybe
a
little
older
in
which
a
man
out
on
bond
complained
because
he
hadn't
been
tried
in
25
terms
of
court.
and
they
said,
look
man,
if
you
didn't
make
a
complaint
about
it,
when
you
are
out
enjoying
your
liberty
and
the
custody
(inaudible),
you
can't
be
heard
to
complain
about
it.
i
don't
rely
on
that,
you
know,
but
the
difference
is
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
but
he
did
it
badly
and
not
in
accord
with
the
law.
i've
got
nothing
left
but
that.
now,
either
he
is
required
to
follow
that
or
he
is
not,
i
contend
that
just
because
he
is
in
a
federal
penitentiary,
doesn't
excuse
him
from
complying
with
it,
especially
since
he
waited
30
months
before
he
complained
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
91502
says,
within
30
days
of
the
first
day
of
each
term
of
the
court
in
which
you're
going
to
be
tried,
you
file
a
demand
for
a
speedy
trial,
serving
a
copy
on
prosecution
for
each
of
three
successive
terms,
and
if
they
don't
do
it,
you're
home
free.
now,
he
didn't
do
that.
now,
that's
not
an
oppressive
requirement,
not
of
him
or
anybody
else.
nobody
says
you
have
to
do
it
in
beautiful
words
in
this
or
that
setting,
just
do
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
the
prosecution
not
the
court.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
the
court
doesn't
decide
when
he
is
to
be
tried,
prosecution
does.
the
state
attorney
has
the
option
of
doing
it
or
not
and
the
court
can't
force
him
to
do
it
at
least
in
florida.
now,
that
may
sound
peculiar
but
in
the
last
analysis,
he
functions
pretty
much
as
a
grand
jury
does.
suppose
they
don't
want
to
indict.
no
court
can
make
him
indict.
and
that's
how
we
have
the
peculiar
situation.
that's
why
we
have
to
have
the
individual
advice
of
state
attorney
or
the
solicitor
as
the
case
maybe.
look,
i
am
pressing
for
a
trial
and
i
want
it
now
or
i
want
it
out
for
a
month,
that
puts
him
on
notice,
but
that
did
not
happen
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
spanning
some
seven
years
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
spanning
a
total
of
seven
years.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
man
is
complaining.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
what?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
went
to
the
circuit
court,
to
the
judge.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct.
in
all
three
instance
judge
hugh
taylor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
sir.
and
i'll
tell
you
why
that's
not
the
proper
vehicle.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
here
we
go.
we're
saying
that
whether
it's
proper
or
not
or
whether
it
was
timely
or
not,
why
are
we
bothering
with
answers,
we're
talking
about
eight
years.
we
could
lay
it
on
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
a
charge
can
be
filed
by
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
look,
they
can
lean
on
him.
of
course
they
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
occasion,
i'm
sure
that
they
have
at
least
i
know
that
i
have
been
done
and
properly
so
most
of
the
time.
but
i
don't
back
off
on
that.
the
point
is,
here's
the
man
complaining
and
he
says,
“look,
i
ought
to
have
a
speedy
trial.
the
first
thing
that
he
didn't
do
was
to
move
forward
when
he
could
have.
he
had
30
months
within
which
he
would
have
had
12
remaining.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
suppose
mr.
justice
black,
he'd
awaited
25
years
to
do
it
three
times.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
just
within
30
days
of
the
first
term
--
first
day
of
the
term.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
he
can.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
july
1,
1960.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
june
28,
i'm
sorry
and
that
was
served
on
the
first.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
was
lodged
with
the
u.s.
marshal's
office
in
marianna.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
because
it
--
no
return
made
on
it
had
been
served.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
will
argue
anything
that
i
think
i
can
use.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
i'll
tell
you
this
very
simple.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
my
defense
is
very
simple
that
he
has
waived
his
right
to
complain
about
it
because
he
didn't
meet
the
requirements
of
91502.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
three
times
running,
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
what
the
statute
says
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
ran
over
quite
a
few
years
and
i
might
add
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
possible
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
trial
until
somebody
else
died.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
exactly.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
virtually,
immediately.
they
acknowledged
what
you
said
in
klopfer
as
their
predicate,
said
alright
mr.
hopkins,
either
make
it
or
miss,
he
made
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon
--
well,
it
was
literally
an
automatic
reversal,
you
didn't
discuss
prejudice.
he
said
i
would
have
to
assume
that
you're
talking
about
the
delay
of
time.
it
becomes
a
commandment
under
the
sixth
amendment.
what
you
did
is
extended
protection.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
certainly,
the
sixth
amendment
was
there,
but
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
in
effect
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
of
course.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
a
fact
and
i
think
that
is
what
i
said
in
my
brief
that
klopfer
makes
no
difference
except
as
to
those
states
which
had
no
state
provision
regarding
speedy
trial.
that
gave
a
complaining
individual
a
right
to
come
to
you
with,
although
the
federal
violation
as
you
enunciated
it
in
klopfer.
until
you
did,
all
that
can
be
said
is
the
sixth
sat
there
until
you
decided
that
it
was
going
to
be
applied
to
the
state
through
the
fourteenth.
now,
i
don't
need
to
be
evasive
but
that's
what
i
understand
you
did
in
klopfer.
now,
if
he
didn't
meet
florida's
requirement
at
a
time
when
he
could
have
and
secured
his
relief
and
didn't
have
the
option
of
doing
it
under
klopfer
because
all
of
his
moves
had
been
made
by
then,
then
i
submit
that
our
court
was
not
in
error,
and
his
demand
for
a
speedy
trial
was
made
at
a
time
when
he
had
no
assurance
without
compliance
with
the
state
law
or
guarantee
under
the
federal
that
he
was
going
to
get
it
simply
by
the
passage
of
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
once
again,
i
would
say
like
i
did
the
last
time
i
was
here
in
november,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
he
did
or
didn't
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
outcome
was
correct
whatever
his
reason.
now,
i
don't
like
to
say
that
on
one
side
top
and
bottom
on
the
other,
but
i
have
to
take
the
order
as
i
can
support
it
without
the
regard
of
what
he
said.
conceivably,
he
could
have
said
something
which
simply
didn't
make
any
legal
sense
and
it
might
never
less
have
been
a
good
order.
so,
very
simply
i
would
say,
we
talk
about
but
strickland
and
he
talks
about
prejudice
--
do
we
have
to
assume
that
if
but
strickland
was
there
to
testify
it,
he
wouldn't
be
complaining
about
the
loss
of
memory?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
waited
and
he
waited
conveniently.
now,
his
sister
died
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
until
his
third
one?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
first
one
was
in
'62,
30
months
after
he
was
jailed.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
about
29
months
--
30
months.
so,
he
wasn't
so
much
interested
in
a
speedy
trial
then.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
but
12
months
after
he
would've
been
out
for
(inaudible)
you
see.
three
terms
the
circuit
court
run
18
months.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
sure
did
know
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
filed
within
28
days
of
the
first
and,
then
on
the
button
on
the
second
and
almost
did
on
the
button
of
the
third.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
look,
i'm
assuming.
i
take
the
position
that
he
did
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
time
of
his
filing,
but
i
will
go
better
than
that.
suppose
that
he
didn't
know
it,
does
he
enjoy
a
better
status
because
he
doesn't
know
it?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
he
certainly
knew
enough
to
make
a
demand
for
a
trial
when
whatever
fashion
he
did.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
quite
enough
until
what
you
said
in
klopfer.
we
can
always
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct
at
the
federal
level.
now,
in
order
for
him
to
have
a
right
to
complain
about
a
federally
assured
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
i
contend
klopfer,
first
put
it
into
effect.
if
we
go
back
to
florida's
time,
then
he
didn't
comply
with
91502
and
the
court
so
stated
in
dickey
and
just
as
soon
as
they
said,
now
is
the
time
mr.
hopkins
for
you
to
move,
he
did
move
and
they
got
him
back.
and
55
days
later,
he
was
tried.
but
about
the
prohibition,
i
can't
stress
that
too
strongly.
if
it
was
a
fact
that
this
man
was
not
going
to
be
stuffed
with
flagging
memories
or
anything
like
that,
why
didn't
he
bring
prohibition
which
is
available
to
him?
he
says
that
the
result
would
be
automatic,
what
was
the
point
in
bringing
it?
well,
if
it
is
automatic,
then
that's
exactly
what
he
should
have
done.
there's
no
point
in
him
sitting
in
raiford
right
now
under
criminal
conviction
when
he
knew
what
the
outcome
would
be
and
could
come
to
you
and
say,
well
now
look
here,
they
denied
me
my
prohibition,
and
on
the
face
of
it,
i
was
entitled
of
a
speedy
trial
because
i
made
these
demands.
he
took
a
chance
and
he
lost
and
he
doesn't
like
it.
that
i
understand
but
it
doesn't
qualify
him
for
relief
under
the
status
of
the
cases
and
existence
of
the
time.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
raiford,
florida
state
penitentiary.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
know
that
it
is
terminated.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
possible
that
they'll
send
him
back
for
the
federal
penitentiary,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
he
got
20
years.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
sir.
considering
the
majesty
of
their
order
in
dickey
and
i
was
on
short
end
of
that
one,
i
can
guarantee
you
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
without
regard
to
klopfer.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
oh
yes.
all
i'm
doing
is
guessing
--
i
don't
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
he
did.
all
i
say
is
that
we
must
measure
it
on
the
pan
with
all
of
what
he
did
and
all
about
which
he
complains.
if
you
take
it
isolated,
of
course
he
qualifies.
who
wouldn't
like
to
come
to
you
and
say
eight
years?
come
on
--
i
think
those
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
alright,
i
contend
that
the
action
of
the
district
court
below
should
be
affirmed
or
at
least
this
case
should
not
be
reversed.
