justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
that,
a
waiver
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
that's
(inaudible)
had
to
have
the
authorities
who
tried
earlier
would've
had
been
the
same
result?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
if
there
was
any
such
thing
as
a
due
process,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
counsel
says
he
asked
and
it
may
be
that
you'll
decide
that
he
did.
i
contend
that
he
did
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
fully
prepared
request
for
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
fully
prepared
request
for
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
that
you
didn't
have
any
request.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
guess
the
essence
to
your
position
as
my
understanding
is
that
up
until
the
proper,
there
is
no
federal
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
all
he
had
up
to
the
klopfer
was
the
state
right
and
he
didn't
comply
with
the
terms
and
state
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then,
following
the
klopfer,
your
court
moved
into
actual
klopfer
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
find
is
that
although
it
was
on
the
books
--
it
was
on
the
books
against
the
federal
government
and
not
against
the
state.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
if
klopfer
had
to
come
up
on
the
books
and
(inaudible),
is
there
anything
wrong
keeping
him
still
in
the
jail
without
being
convicted
and
giving
rise
to
any
constitutional
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument
leaves
out
one
very
important
factor
and
that
is
that
due
process
right
of
this
man
to
have
a
speedy
trial
or
some
kind
of
the
trial
that
the
state
affords
independently
of
klopfer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
by
that
you
mean
it
is
retroactive?
justice
john
m.
harlan
klopfer
is
retroactive.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
