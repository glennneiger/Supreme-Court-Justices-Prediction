mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
nature
of
this
case
is
one
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
robbery
charge,
sentence
to
10
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
the
trial
had
been
delayed
for
a
period
of
eight
years.
the
case
was
duly
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals,
raising
the
constitutional
question,
the
sixth
amendment.
the
issue
in
this
case
before
this
court
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
united
states
to
put
this
case
in
proper
perspective.
this
is
a
continuation
of
what
developed
in
smith
v.
hooey.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
facts
first
as
they're
most
important.
28th
of
june,
1960,
a
robbery
occurred
in
gadsden
county,
florida.
on
the
1st
of
july,
1960,
a
warrant
for
the
petitioner's
arrest
was
sworn
at.
at
that
time,
petitioner
was
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
on
related
charges
of
bank
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
in
the
jurisdiction
of
florida
from
july
until
september
1960.
in
september
1960,
petitioner
was
transferred
into
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
and
subsequently
sent
to
leavenworth
penitentiary.
during
the
period
from
july
until
september
1960,
the
state
of
florida
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
execute
the
warrant
other
than
to
place
it
into
the
hands
of
the
sheriff.
several
years
expired
and
in
october
of
the
29th,
1962,
the
petitioner
filed
a
written
demand
with
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county
requesting
that
he
be
brought
back
to
florida
or
that
the
charges
be
dismissed
against
him.
the
court
in
an
order
denied
this
request
stating
that
there
was
no
authority
upon
the
state
of
florida
to
return
petitioner
to
florida
to
stay
in
trial
since
he
was
detained
in
federal
custody,
and
that
he
was
there
because
of
his
own
doings.
petitioner
subsequently
filed
two
more
written
demands.
he
filed
one
in
april
1963
and
another
in
march
1968.
after
that,
the
petitioner
filed
original
mandamus
proceedings
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
a
decision
held
that
either
florida
had
to
return
petitioner
to
stay
in
trial
or
else
to
drop
the
detainer
charges
against
him.
petitioner
then
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
september
1,
1967,
requesting
that
the
charges
be
dropped
against
him.
there
was
no
action
on
this
motion.
the
state
in
an
ex
parte
order
on
december
15,
1967,
obtained
an
order
from
the
trial
court
having
jurisdiction
which
ordered
the
petitioner
back
to
florida
to
stay
in
trial
on
january
23,
1968.
petitioner
was
brought
back
into
custody
on
that
date.
and
on
that
date,
an
arraignment
was
held
and
he
was
ordered
to
trial
on
that
friday,
but
over
objection
of
counsel,
the
trial
was
continued
until
january
31,
1968.
on
january
30,
1968,
the
petitioner
filed
two
motions.
the
first
motion
was
a
content
motion
for
a
continuance
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
locate
two
defense
witnesses;
one
by
the
name
of
dolan
who
would
have
cooperated
certain
testimony
that
he
had
been
in
the
place
that
had
been
robbed,
and
another
by
the
name
of
strickland
who
would
have
testified
that
on
the
night
that
the
robbery
occurred
in
florida
that
the
petitioner
was
in
waycross,
georgia.
the
court
granted
the
motion
for
continuance,
and
on
the
same
date,
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
information
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
the
court
withheld
ruling
on
this
motion.
he
also
filed
with
the
motion
an
affidavit
stating
that
one
of
his
witnesses
had
died
in
1964.
on
february,
the
court
then
continued
the
trial
of
the
case
until
february
13,
1968.
on
february
12,
1968,
the
petitioner
then
filed
another
motion
for
continuance
based
upon
the
fact
that
one
strickland
and
aid
by
strickland
still
could
be
not
located.
by
that
time,
the
witness
dolan
had
been
located,
had
been
subpoenaed
for
the
trial.
the
court
on
february
13,
1968
denied
the
motion
to
quash
based
upon
the
constitutional
grounds
and
ordered
petitioner
to
trial.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
deputy
sheriff
who
testified
for
the
state,
testified
that
he
had
destroyed
the
notes
that
he
had
taken
down
in
connection
with
the
description
given
to
him
by
the
victim
when
the
robbery
had
occurred,
which
brings
us
to
the
contention
in
this
case.
as
we're
dealing
with
the
sixth
amendment
case
and
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
as
i
mentioned
previously,
this
picks
up
where
smith
v.
hooey
left
off
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
now,
the
general
reasoning
has
been
that
where
a
person
can
show
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
defense,
this
has
been
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
defendant
would
not
get
a
fair
trial.
if
in
fact
he
could
show
that
witnesses
were
dead
or
missing,
that
witnesses
couldn't
be
gotten
in
time
for
the
trial.
now,
the
state's
contention
is,
in
this
case
at
one,
they
gave
the
petitioner
a
speedy
trial,
and
two,
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defense.
it
is
our
position
that
there
was
a
prejudice
to
the
defense
because
of
the
eight-year
delay
because
that
a
witness
was
unavailable
to
support
the
petitioner's
contention,
and
three,
that
a
witness
had
died,
and
four,
that
vital
evidence
had
been
destroyed
not
maliciously
by
the
state,
but
simply
because
as
the
deputy
sheriff
said
that
he
didn't
know
when
this
man
would
come
to
trial.
now,
20
year
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
pardon
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
the
statute
of
limitations
said
and
told
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
the
statute
of
limitations
in
florida
is
told
when
the
warrant
is
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hands,
and
that
stops
whether
he's
in
the
state
or
out
of
state.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
told.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
case
that
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
which
is
rosengarten
versus
state.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
my
understanding
of
it
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
two
years.
on
a
non-capital
case.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
begins
to
run
as
soon
as
the
offense
is
committed.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
way
i
understand
the
ruling
is
in
florida.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
even
if
the
defendant
is
within
the
jurisdiction
because
the
defendant
then
has
the
availability
of
florida
statutes,
91501
and
91502
which
gives
him
the
right
to
demand
trial
and
push
the
case
alone.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
if
the
defendant
is
out
of
state,
no
warrant
has
been
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hand.
then,
that
withhold
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
absence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
was
constitutional
authority.
florida
had
on
its
books,
94105
which
was
a
statute
permitting
it
to
obtain
a
prisoner
from
another
state.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
no
sir.
this
would
be
a
little
different
proceeding,
94105.
now,
florida
had
not.
now,
this
case
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
florida
had
never
ruled
until
the
dickey
case
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court
of
whether
the
state
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
bring
an
individual
back
from
another
state
who
is
in
some
type
of
custody.
in
dickey
v.
--
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
the,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
state
had
the
constitution
of
duty
to
bring
an
individual
back
to
florida.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
that
could've
been
done
here
even
without
the
decision
in
dickey
versus
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
discussing
the
question
of
the
prejudice
in
this
case,
we
have
not
dwelt
on
this
in
any
length
because
i
think
the
decisions
are
apparent
to
this
court.
there's
--
on
page
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
where
there
is
shown
prejudice
to
the
defense.
another
argument
may
be
made
that
assuming
that
all
witnesses
were
present,
would
this
still
have
been
prejudicial
in
this
case.
we
contend
it
would've.
we
contend
that
anytime
there
is
a
lengthy
delay
that
the
guilt
determination
process
is
eroded
simply
because
of
virtue
of
the
fact
that
witnesses
forget
as
the
years
pass
what
they're
supposed
to
remember
in
order
to
testify
to.
and
obviously,
the
guilt
that
obviously
the
right
of
cross-examination
is
lost
to
the
defendant.
the
trial
itself
literally
becomes
a
mockery
because
the
witnesses
cannot
recall
events
that
had
happened
many
years
ago.
now,
in
the
case
of
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
which
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
commentators
have
said
that
there
has
been
no
prejudice
discussed
in
this
case,
but
we
do
note
that
as
noted
by
this
court
in
klopfer
that
the
delay
which
an
accused
is
subjected
to
that
his
movement,
his
freedom
of
movement
is
curtailed,
the
suspicion
that
he
committed
the
crime,
that
the
community
is
actually
interested
in
an
early
trial,
and
that
these
factors
are
sufficient
among
the
others
to
show
that
there
was
prejudice
and
in
this
case
to
mr.
dickey.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
respondent
claims
that
the
petitioner,
dickey,
did
not
comply
with
the
florida
statutes.
florida
has
on
its
books
91501
and
91502.
in
91501,
if
a
person
is
free
and
he
can
demand
trial
in
three
terms
of
court,
and
if
he
complies
with
these
statutory
regulations
and
he
is
not
brought
to
trial
within
three
terms
of
court,
then
the
charge
is
dismissed
completely
and
forever
barred.
now,
91502
says
the
same
thing
except
for
a
person
who
is
in
custody.
now,
the
state
of
florida
contends
that
the
petitioner
never
complied
with
these
statutes
and
we
will
agree
with
that
and
there
is
no
argument.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
when
the
petitioner
filed
his
written
demand
with
the
court
having
jurisdiction
the
first
time
it
was
laid,
when
he
filed
his
second
demand,
that
he
was
right
on
time
but
that
court
then
said,
“we
have
no
authority
to
bring
you
back
from
another
jurisdiction.”
so
he
was
neither
fished
nor
found.
he
couldn't
get
the
benefits
of
the
florida
statutes
that
which
the
other
people
who
were
incarcerated
and
present
in
that
state
were
entitled
to
and
who
could've
had
a
speedy
trial.
so
i
don't
think
the
argument
that
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
statutes
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
we're
contending
that
there
was
no
waiver
here
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
because
he
filed
his
written
demand,
even
though
he
didn't
track
the
florida
statutes.
we're
also
contending
that
the
state
is
contending
that
he
got
a
speedy
trial.
we're
saying
that
an
eight-year
delay
is
not
a
speedy
trial.
we're
saying
that
the
factors
in
this
case
of
the
dead
and
missing
witnesses
that
the
destruction
of
the
notes
are
sufficient
in
itself
to
show
a
prejudice
to
the
defense.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
he
was
in
federal
prison
your
honor,
leavenworth
and
alcatraza
prison.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
bank
robberies
which
he
had
pled
guilty
to
in
florida,
but
they
were
federal
charges.
the
state
has
also
raised
a
contention
that
he
should
not
have
applied
or
gone
about
raising
the
question
of
the
right
to
the
speedy
trial
after
conviction.
the
state
is
contending
in
their
brief
that
he
should
have
by
the
writ
of
prohibition.
the
answer
to
this
is
that
our
office
was
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
on
january
23,
1968
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
and
the
trial
court
at
that
time
set
the
trial
which
was
a
matter
of
eight
days
later
that
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
in
which
to
raise
these
questions
by
writ
of
prohibition.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
already,
the
trial
court
had
determined
that
they
weren't
going
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
there's
prejudice
in
the
defense
when
he
filed
his
first
written
demand
for
a
speedy
trial.
now,
when
this
case
went
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
had
before
it
the
factual
situation
that
this
man
had
not
been
tried
in
seven-and-a-half
years
and
they
refused
at
that
point
to
answer
the
question
whether
there's
going
to
be
prejudice
to
his
defense,
always
deferring
back
that
when
you
get
the
trial,
then
the
trial
court
can
make
this
determination.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
for
the
speedy
trial
your
honor?
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
was
october
29,
1962.
so,
it
is
our
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
or
leavenworth,
one
of
the
other.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
the
writ
of
prohibition
route
would
have
resulted
in
the
same
thing
that
this
was
too
premature
in
order
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
this
defendant
was
denied
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
i
would
like
to
point
a
few
other
matters.
the
state
has
alleged
that
one
of
the
witnesses,
mary
mccalcline
was
not
called
as
a
witness
at
this
trial.
i
don't
think
this
was
known
to
counsel
for
the
respondent,
but
that
she
had
died
in
1960.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
no
sir.
that
was
the
one
which
the
counsel
refers
to
as
the
woman
who
was
with
him
the
night
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
in
waycross,
georgia,
or
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
–-
yes
sir.
i
think
you
can
almost
say
that
in
every
case
that
there
is
some
inherent
prejudice
in
extremely
long
delay.
even
assuming
that
every
witness
was
there,
even
assuming
that
the
documentary
evidence
was
there.
i
think
it's
inherent.
it's
just
a
common
known
fact
that
delay
itself
fades
the
memory
of
people.
i
recall
of
a
book
by
mr.
francis
wellman,
the
art
of
cross
examination,
where
a
little
mock
scene
was
demonstrated
before
the
class
he
reports
and
then
different
conflicting
reports,
and
there,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes.
for
the
reasons
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
your
honor
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
really
doesn't
because
most
of
the
commentators
have
said
that
the
benefit
ignores
to
the
defendant.
i
think
this
is
erroneous.
once
you
get
down
the
line,
you're
taking
a
gamble.
they
can
ignore
to
the
detriment
of
either
the
defendant
or
to
the
prosecution.
well,
if
it
adored
to
him,
obviously
-–
let's
assume
that
he
would
go
for
the
not
guilty
type
of
situation,
but
in
that
case
looking
at
it
in
its
broad
perspective,
i
don't
think
the
answer
justice
are
concerned.
we're
not
getting
a
fair
trial
at
that
point.
it
suddenly
becomes
a
gamble.
who
can
outlast
who?
whether
the
prosecution
can
outlast
the
defendant
or
the
defendant
can
outlast
the
prosecution?
so
you're
literally
losing
that,
the
way
i
understand,
the
adversary
system,
the
very
vital
thing
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
truth.
and
when
you
get
the
situation
there,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
either
side
about
this
your
honor.
now
for
those
reasons,
request
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
decision
be
reversed
and
that
the
petitioner
be
discharged
from
this
conviction
in
sentence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
petitioner
is
presently
incarcerated
at
leavenworth.
his
sentence
expires
in
1971.
he
was
given
a
10-year
sentence
to
run
consecutively
to
any
presently
existing
sentences.
so,
he
will
not
be
back
in
the
state
of
florida
until
1971.
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
the
florida
sentence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
good
time
but
his
sentence
is
10
because
the
order
read
consecutively
beyond
existing
sentence.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
point
here.
counsel
has
made
the
statement
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
statutes.
the
way
i
read
the
order
of
the
trial
judge
on
december
1,
1962
even
assuming
that
the
petitioner
have
complied
with
91502,
this
judge
would
not
have
returned
him
to
florida
that
it
wasn't
until
dickey
versus
the
circuit
court
which
came
at
and
marked
but
in
june
14,
1967,
did
florida
say,
they
created
a
third
statute
in
the
sense,
and
that
statute
was
that
people
who
were
incarcerated
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
florida,
could
be
brought
back
in
for
a
trial.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
my
position.
counsel
has
made
--
in
other
words
that
he
had
counsel
during
this
period
while
he
was
at
leavenworth,
he
did
not
have
counsel.
and
for
those
reasons,
i
mean
--
your
honor,
yes.
if
this
court
--
this
is
a
fundamental
right,
if
this
court
has
said
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
as
these
fundamental
right
to
counsel,
i
think
that
it
was
always
there
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
he
had
this
right,
yes
your
honor,
always.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
--
i
understand.
i
have
no
further
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
nature
of
this
case
is
one
where
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
robbery
charge,
sentence
to
10
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
the
trial
had
been
delayed
for
a
period
of
eight
years.
the
case
was
duly
appealed
to
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals,
raising
the
constitutional
question,
the
sixth
amendment.
the
issue
in
this
case
before
this
court
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution
united
states
to
put
this
case
in
proper
perspective.
this
is
a
continuation
of
what
developed
in
smith
v.
hooey.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
facts
first
as
they're
most
important.
28th
of
june,
1960,
a
robbery
occurred
in
gadsden
county,
florida.
on
the
1st
of
july,
1960,
a
warrant
for
the
petitioner's
arrest
was
sworn
at.
at
that
time,
petitioner
was
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
on
related
charges
of
bank
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
in
the
jurisdiction
of
florida
from
july
until
september
1960.
in
september
1960,
petitioner
was
transferred
into
the
custody
of
the
federal
authorities
and
subsequently
sent
to
leavenworth
penitentiary.
during
the
period
from
july
until
september
1960,
the
state
of
florida
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
execute
the
warrant
other
than
to
place
it
into
the
hands
of
the
sheriff.
several
years
expired
and
in
october
of
the
29th,
1962,
the
petitioner
filed
a
written
demand
with
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county
requesting
that
he
be
brought
back
to
florida
or
that
the
charges
be
dismissed
against
him.
the
court
in
an
order
denied
this
request
stating
that
there
was
no
authority
upon
the
state
of
florida
to
return
petitioner
to
florida
to
stay
in
trial
since
he
was
detained
in
federal
custody,
and
that
he
was
there
because
of
his
own
doings.
petitioner
subsequently
filed
two
more
written
demands.
he
filed
one
in
april
1963
and
another
in
march
1968.
after
that,
the
petitioner
filed
original
mandamus
proceedings
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
a
decision
held
that
either
florida
had
to
return
petitioner
to
stay
in
trial
or
else
to
drop
the
detainer
charges
against
him.
petitioner
then
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
september
1,
1967,
requesting
that
the
charges
be
dropped
against
him.
there
was
no
action
on
this
motion.
the
state
in
an
ex
parte
order
on
december
15,
1967,
obtained
an
order
from
the
trial
court
having
jurisdiction
which
ordered
the
petitioner
back
to
florida
to
stay
in
trial
on
january
23,
1968.
petitioner
was
brought
back
into
custody
on
that
date.
and
on
that
date,
an
arraignment
was
held
and
he
was
ordered
to
trial
on
that
friday,
but
over
objection
of
counsel,
the
trial
was
continued
until
january
31,
1968.
on
january
30,
1968,
the
petitioner
filed
two
motions.
the
first
motion
was
a
content
motion
for
a
continuance
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
locate
two
defense
witnesses;
one
by
the
name
of
dolan
who
would
have
cooperated
certain
testimony
that
he
had
been
in
the
place
that
had
been
robbed,
and
another
by
the
name
of
strickland
who
would
have
testified
that
on
the
night
that
the
robbery
occurred
in
florida
that
the
petitioner
was
in
waycross,
georgia.
the
court
granted
the
motion
for
continuance,
and
on
the
same
date,
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
information
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
the
court
withheld
ruling
on
this
motion.
he
also
filed
with
the
motion
an
affidavit
stating
that
one
of
his
witnesses
had
died
in
1964.
on
february,
the
court
then
continued
the
trial
of
the
case
until
february
13,
1968.
on
february
12,
1968,
the
petitioner
then
filed
another
motion
for
continuance
based
upon
the
fact
that
one
strickland
and
aid
by
strickland
still
could
be
not
located.
by
that
time,
the
witness
dolan
had
been
located,
had
been
subpoenaed
for
the
trial.
the
court
on
february
13,
1968
denied
the
motion
to
quash
based
upon
the
constitutional
grounds
and
ordered
petitioner
to
trial.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
deputy
sheriff
who
testified
for
the
state,
testified
that
he
had
destroyed
the
notes
that
he
had
taken
down
in
connection
with
the
description
given
to
him
by
the
victim
when
the
robbery
had
occurred,
which
brings
us
to
the
contention
in
this
case.
as
we're
dealing
with
the
sixth
amendment
case
and
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
as
i
mentioned
previously,
this
picks
up
where
smith
v.
hooey
left
off
decided
by
this
court
last
term.
now,
the
general
reasoning
has
been
that
where
a
person
can
show
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
defense,
this
has
been
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
defendant
would
not
get
a
fair
trial.
if
in
fact
he
could
show
that
witnesses
were
dead
or
missing,
that
witnesses
couldn't
be
gotten
in
time
for
the
trial.
now,
the
state's
contention
is,
in
this
case
at
one,
they
gave
the
petitioner
a
speedy
trial,
and
two,
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
defense.
it
is
our
position
that
there
was
a
prejudice
to
the
defense
because
of
the
eight-year
delay
because
that
a
witness
was
unavailable
to
support
the
petitioner's
contention,
and
three,
that
a
witness
had
died,
and
four,
that
vital
evidence
had
been
destroyed
not
maliciously
by
the
state,
but
simply
because
as
the
deputy
sheriff
said
that
he
didn't
know
when
this
man
would
come
to
trial.
now,
20
year
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
pardon
me
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
the
statute
of
limitations
said
and
told
in
this
case,
that
is
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
the
statute
of
limitations
in
florida
is
told
when
the
warrant
is
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hands,
and
that
stops
whether
he's
in
the
state
or
out
of
state.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it's
told.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
case
that
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
which
is
rosengarten
versus
state.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
my
understanding
of
it
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
two
years.
on
a
non-capital
case.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
begins
to
run
as
soon
as
the
offense
is
committed.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
way
i
understand
the
ruling
is
in
florida.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
even
if
the
defendant
is
within
the
jurisdiction
because
the
defendant
then
has
the
availability
of
florida
statutes,
91501
and
91502
which
gives
him
the
right
to
demand
trial
and
push
the
case
alone.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
if
the
defendant
is
out
of
state,
no
warrant
has
been
placed
in
the
sheriff's
hand.
then,
that
withhold
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
absence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
was
constitutional
authority.
florida
had
on
its
books,
94105
which
was
a
statute
permitting
it
to
obtain
a
prisoner
from
another
state.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
no
sir.
this
would
be
a
little
different
proceeding,
94105.
now,
florida
had
not.
now,
this
case
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
florida
had
never
ruled
until
the
dickey
case
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court
of
whether
the
state
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
bring
an
individual
back
from
another
state
who
is
in
some
type
of
custody.
in
dickey
v.
--
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
the,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
state
had
the
constitution
of
duty
to
bring
an
individual
back
to
florida.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
that
could've
been
done
here
even
without
the
decision
in
dickey
versus
the
circuit
court
of
gadsden
county,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
discussing
the
question
of
the
prejudice
in
this
case,
we
have
not
dwelt
on
this
in
any
length
because
i
think
the
decisions
are
apparent
to
this
court.
there's
--
on
page
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
where
there
is
shown
prejudice
to
the
defense.
another
argument
may
be
made
that
assuming
that
all
witnesses
were
present,
would
this
still
have
been
prejudicial
in
this
case.
we
contend
it
would've.
we
contend
that
anytime
there
is
a
lengthy
delay
that
the
guilt
determination
process
is
eroded
simply
because
of
virtue
of
the
fact
that
witnesses
forget
as
the
years
pass
what
they're
supposed
to
remember
in
order
to
testify
to.
and
obviously,
the
guilt
that
obviously
the
right
of
cross-examination
is
lost
to
the
defendant.
the
trial
itself
literally
becomes
a
mockery
because
the
witnesses
cannot
recall
events
that
had
happened
many
years
ago.
now,
in
the
case
of
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
which
was
decided
by
this
court,
the
commentators
have
said
that
there
has
been
no
prejudice
discussed
in
this
case,
but
we
do
note
that
as
noted
by
this
court
in
klopfer
that
the
delay
which
an
accused
is
subjected
to
that
his
movement,
his
freedom
of
movement
is
curtailed,
the
suspicion
that
he
committed
the
crime,
that
the
community
is
actually
interested
in
an
early
trial,
and
that
these
factors
are
sufficient
among
the
others
to
show
that
there
was
prejudice
and
in
this
case
to
mr.
dickey.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
respondent
claims
that
the
petitioner,
dickey,
did
not
comply
with
the
florida
statutes.
florida
has
on
its
books
91501
and
91502.
in
91501,
if
a
person
is
free
and
he
can
demand
trial
in
three
terms
of
court,
and
if
he
complies
with
these
statutory
regulations
and
he
is
not
brought
to
trial
within
three
terms
of
court,
then
the
charge
is
dismissed
completely
and
forever
barred.
now,
91502
says
the
same
thing
except
for
a
person
who
is
in
custody.
now,
the
state
of
florida
contends
that
the
petitioner
never
complied
with
these
statutes
and
we
will
agree
with
that
and
there
is
no
argument.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
when
the
petitioner
filed
his
written
demand
with
the
court
having
jurisdiction
the
first
time
it
was
laid,
when
he
filed
his
second
demand,
that
he
was
right
on
time
but
that
court
then
said,
“we
have
no
authority
to
bring
you
back
from
another
jurisdiction.”
so
he
was
neither
fished
nor
found.
he
couldn't
get
the
benefits
of
the
florida
statutes
that
which
the
other
people
who
were
incarcerated
and
present
in
that
state
were
entitled
to
and
who
could've
had
a
speedy
trial.
so
i
don't
think
the
argument
that
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
statutes
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
we're
contending
that
there
was
no
waiver
here
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
because
he
filed
his
written
demand,
even
though
he
didn't
track
the
florida
statutes.
we're
also
contending
that
the
state
is
contending
that
he
got
a
speedy
trial.
we're
saying
that
an
eight-year
delay
is
not
a
speedy
trial.
we're
saying
that
the
factors
in
this
case
of
the
dead
and
missing
witnesses
that
the
destruction
of
the
notes
are
sufficient
in
itself
to
show
a
prejudice
to
the
defense.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
he
was
in
federal
prison
your
honor,
leavenworth
and
alcatraza
prison.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
bank
robberies
which
he
had
pled
guilty
to
in
florida,
but
they
were
federal
charges.
the
state
has
also
raised
a
contention
that
he
should
not
have
applied
or
gone
about
raising
the
question
of
the
right
to
the
speedy
trial
after
conviction.
the
state
is
contending
in
their
brief
that
he
should
have
by
the
writ
of
prohibition.
the
answer
to
this
is
that
our
office
was
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
on
january
23,
1968
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
and
the
trial
court
at
that
time
set
the
trial
which
was
a
matter
of
eight
days
later
that
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
in
which
to
raise
these
questions
by
writ
of
prohibition.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
already,
the
trial
court
had
determined
that
they
weren't
going
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
there's
prejudice
in
the
defense
when
he
filed
his
first
written
demand
for
a
speedy
trial.
now,
when
this
case
went
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
had
before
it
the
factual
situation
that
this
man
had
not
been
tried
in
seven-and-a-half
years
and
they
refused
at
that
point
to
answer
the
question
whether
there's
going
to
be
prejudice
to
his
defense,
always
deferring
back
that
when
you
get
the
trial,
then
the
trial
court
can
make
this
determination.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
for
the
speedy
trial
your
honor?
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
was
october
29,
1962.
so,
it
is
our
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir,
or
leavenworth,
one
of
the
other.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
the
writ
of
prohibition
route
would
have
resulted
in
the
same
thing
that
this
was
too
premature
in
order
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
this
defendant
was
denied
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
i
would
like
to
point
a
few
other
matters.
the
state
has
alleged
that
one
of
the
witnesses,
mary
mccalcline
was
not
called
as
a
witness
at
this
trial.
i
don't
think
this
was
known
to
counsel
for
the
respondent,
but
that
she
had
died
in
1960.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
no
sir.
that
was
the
one
which
the
counsel
refers
to
as
the
woman
who
was
with
him
the
night
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
in
waycross,
georgia,
or
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
–-
yes
sir.
i
think
you
can
almost
say
that
in
every
case
that
there
is
some
inherent
prejudice
in
extremely
long
delay.
even
assuming
that
every
witness
was
there,
even
assuming
that
the
documentary
evidence
was
there.
i
think
it's
inherent.
it's
just
a
common
known
fact
that
delay
itself
fades
the
memory
of
people.
i
recall
of
a
book
by
mr.
francis
wellman,
the
art
of
cross
examination,
where
a
little
mock
scene
was
demonstrated
before
the
class
he
reports
and
then
different
conflicting
reports,
and
there,
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes.
for
the
reasons
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
your
honor
–-
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
it
really
doesn't
because
most
of
the
commentators
have
said
that
the
benefit
ignores
to
the
defendant.
i
think
this
is
erroneous.
once
you
get
down
the
line,
you're
taking
a
gamble.
they
can
ignore
to
the
detriment
of
either
the
defendant
or
to
the
prosecution.
well,
if
it
adored
to
him,
obviously
-–
let's
assume
that
he
would
go
for
the
not
guilty
type
of
situation,
but
in
that
case
looking
at
it
in
its
broad
perspective,
i
don't
think
the
answer
justice
are
concerned.
we're
not
getting
a
fair
trial
at
that
point.
it
suddenly
becomes
a
gamble.
who
can
outlast
who?
whether
the
prosecution
can
outlast
the
defendant
or
the
defendant
can
outlast
the
prosecution?
so
you're
literally
losing
that,
the
way
i
understand,
the
adversary
system,
the
very
vital
thing
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
truth.
and
when
you
get
the
situation
there,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
either
side
about
this
your
honor.
now
for
those
reasons,
request
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
decision
be
reversed
and
that
the
petitioner
be
discharged
from
this
conviction
in
sentence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
petitioner
is
presently
incarcerated
at
leavenworth.
his
sentence
expires
in
1971.
he
was
given
a
10-year
sentence
to
run
consecutively
to
any
presently
existing
sentences.
so,
he
will
not
be
back
in
the
state
of
florida
until
1971.
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
the
florida
sentence.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
good
time
but
his
sentence
is
10
because
the
order
read
consecutively
beyond
existing
sentence.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
point
here.
counsel
has
made
the
statement
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
statutes.
the
way
i
read
the
order
of
the
trial
judge
on
december
1,
1962
even
assuming
that
the
petitioner
have
complied
with
91502,
this
judge
would
not
have
returned
him
to
florida
that
it
wasn't
until
dickey
versus
the
circuit
court
which
came
at
and
marked
but
in
june
14,
1967,
did
florida
say,
they
created
a
third
statute
in
the
sense,
and
that
statute
was
that
people
who
were
incarcerated
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
florida,
could
be
brought
back
in
for
a
trial.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
is
my
position.
counsel
has
made
--
in
other
words
that
he
had
counsel
during
this
period
while
he
was
at
leavenworth,
he
did
not
have
counsel.
and
for
those
reasons,
i
mean
--
your
honor,
yes.
if
this
court
--
this
is
a
fundamental
right,
if
this
court
has
said
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
is
as
these
fundamental
right
to
counsel,
i
think
that
it
was
always
there
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
he
had
this
right,
yes
your
honor,
always.
mr.
john
d.
buchanan,
jr.
--
i
understand.
i
have
no
further
--
