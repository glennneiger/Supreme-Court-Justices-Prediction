unknown
speaker
do
we
know
mr.
wulf
how
judge
--
how
it
came
about
that
judge
dixon
ceased
to
hold
office
as
a
judge?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
--
do
you
mean,
the
--
this
addresses
itself
to
2
(22)
(3)
as
applied,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
what
--
you
say
this
addresses
itself
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
section
we
have
before
us,
2
(22)
(3),
isn't
that
it,
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
jurisdiction
--
our
jurisdiction
here
this,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
that
on
its
face,
so
you
have
no
--
you
can't
--
unknown
speaker
can
i
mr.
wulf,
then
i
come
back
to
my
question,
then
you
go
on
as
i
read
your
supplemental
brief
to
say
that
the
--
you
do
the
constitutionality
of
2
(22)
(3)
based
upon
the
first
amendment
as
applied,
is
that
right?
is
that
what
you're
saying
there?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
you're
here
by
appeal.
unknown
speaker
and
you
got
it
as
a
cert?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know,
what
are
these
--
alright,
what
are
the
cert
issues
now
that
you
want
us
--
unknown
speaker
now,
where
else
mr.
wulf
did
you
raise
this
in
any
federal
constitutional
matters
in
the
trial
court
other
than
the
page
18?
unknown
speaker
and
while
you're
about
it
mr.
wulf,
will
you
then
point
out
what
the
issues
on
cert
are
that
you
thinking
now
before
us.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
is
first
amendment
issues,
isn't
it?
you
rely
on
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
is
was
raised
by
that
comment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
cert
issues
are
there?
unknown
speaker
but
they
denied
certiorari.
we
don't
know
whether
they
--
didn't
--
they
may
have
denied
it
because
you
haven't
raised
anything
in
the
lower
court.
unknown
speaker
and
what's
that
mean
in
louisiana,
i
used
to
know
i
don't
remember
now,
it
has
something
to
do
with
merits,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
has
some
technical
significant
system,
the
substantive
quasi,
but
i
don't
know.
which
would
be
for
you
of
virginia?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
the
determination
on
the
merits,
you
see.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
if
there
were
a
rule
in
louisiana
that
you
must
raise
the
issues
in
the
trial
court
to
have
them
considered
in
the
appellate
court
then
you
haven't
raised
the
issue
as
soon
as
you
can
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
other
side
of
it
anyway,
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
wulf
is
something
about
this
louisiana
practice
that
makes
that
form
a
disposition
on
the
merits
not
merely
a
denial
of
review
where
cert
would
be
here
but
when
i
used
that
form
for
disposition
of
a
petition
for
a
writ
as
i
recall
that
constitutes
also
a
disposition
on
the
merit
that
no
merit
in
the
points
raised.
unknown
speaker
assuming
they
were
raised.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
your
adversary
put
a
light
on
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know
i'm
taking
it
too
much
of
your
time
and
apologize
but
what
other
cert
issues
are
there
that
you
think
are
before
us?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
this
quite
clear
mr.
wulf.
unknown
speaker
the
language,
i'm
looking
at
page
8
of
the
motion
on
order
for
recusation,
paragraph
4
refers
to
the
client
hopkins
as
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
removed
from
office
for
“as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.”
unknown
speaker
now,
do
i
understand
you
that
that's
the
exact
language
from
the
statute
under
which
hopkins
was
bringing
his
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
now
--
unknown
speaker
now,
it
was
his
use
of
that
language
in
the
motion
which
was
a
basis
for
the
discipline,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
basis
for
a
disbarment
and
conviction?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sixth
amendment
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
will
you
tell
me
mr.
dixon,
what
is
the
significance
of
there
is
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
complained
of.
it's
my
impression
if
that
somehow
deals
with
the
merits,
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i'm
quite
wrong,
you
know
better
than
i.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
question
of
–
let's
assume
that
the
writ
was
issued
to
the
right
court,
do
you
have
any
object
--
other
objections
towards
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
because
they
just
filed
a
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
--
unknown
speaker
namely
just
their
petition
for
a
cert?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
the
questions
were
adequately
raised
in
the
trial
court,
these
questions
that
contained
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
the
statement
of
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
--
i
don't
suppose
that
it
could
be
held
contemptuous
if
a
--
if
an
attorney
asks
the
judge
to
recuse
himself
for
bias
against
this
client
because
--
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
judge
says,
well,
what
makes
you
think
i
am
biased?
and
he
says,
well
my
client
has
--
trying
to
get
you
impeached
for
biased
and
for
corruption.
now,
that's
quite
relevant
to
the
bias
charge,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
why
not
for
having
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
put
that
--
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
can
be
held
in
contempt
here
because
what?
unknown
speaker
because
he
does
allege
that
he
is
planning
--
unknown
speaker
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
mr.
wulf
how
judge
--
how
it
came
about
that
judge
dixon
ceased
to
hold
