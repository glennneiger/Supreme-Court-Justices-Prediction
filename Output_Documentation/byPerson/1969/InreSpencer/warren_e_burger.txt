chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
513,
we'll
hear
arguments
in
the
matter
of
dan
a.
spencer.
now
as
to
number
4,
younger
against
harris,
we'll
ask
counsel
to
standby
for
a
while
and
perhaps
at
the
half
break
when
we're
certain
that
we
are
going
to
have
this
case
completed
with
no
emergencies
then
counsel
could
be
excused
at
2:30
if
no
emergencies
arise.
mr.
wulf,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
motion
contain
any
new
matter
that
he
hadn't
known
the
day
before
or
the
week
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
reasonable,
can
any
inferences
be
drawn
as
to
whether
this
was
some
discovery
overnight
or
whether
it
was
a
new
idea
after
he
learned
that
he
had
received
an
adverse
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
--
you're
going
to
address
yourself
to
whether
you
are
legally
here
at
all
on
the
question
whether
there
is
an
appeal
here,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
some
point,
will
you
develop
what
could
be
the
nexus
or
what
is
the
nexus
as
you
see
it
between
the
allegations
of
corruption
and
the
allegations
of
bias
or
perhaps
indicate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
none,
i'm
puzzled
by
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
point
--
excuse
me,
before
you
get
to
the
cert
issue
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
if
what
is
now
disposed
in
your
supplemental
brief
had
been
included
in
your
jurisdictional
statement,
is
it
possible
that
the
--
it
would've
been
a
dismissal
out
of
hand
of
the
whole
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
not?
if
you
admit
now
that
you
had
no
basis
for
being
here
on
appeal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you
--
you
hadn't
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari,
you
had
filed
an
appeal,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
it
would've
been
more
a
lawyerlike
to
have
filed
a
document
in
the
form
that
mr.
justice
harlan
just
suggested
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
where
he
is
incorporating
by
reference
and
drawing
the
court's
attention
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judge
in
question
wasn't
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
document?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
and
therefore
would
it
not
have
been
at
least
more
lawyerlike
to
have
simply
called
attention
to
the
existence,
dependency
of
such
a
matter
by
reference
to
the
document
and
let
the
document
speak
for
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
perhaps
wouldn't
be
here
if
that
course
had
been
followed,
is
that
likely
in
your
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
might
have
been
done
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wulf.
mr.
dixon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
did
the
judge
say
here
in
fact
on
page
14,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
speaking
of
the
sentence
that
begins
right
in
the
middle,
this
shall
we
say
will
be
--
be
between
yourself
and
this
court,
and
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
that
he
said
between
yourself
and
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
point,
does
he
say
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
any
petition
filed
anywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
to
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
judge
williams
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
judge
who
was
going
to
hear
the
contempt.
at
that
time
did
the
petitioner
here
put
into
evidence
any
document
or
any
evidence
by
any
process
indicating
that
before
he
filed
this
pleading,
there
had
been
a
petition
of
some
kind
filed
alleging
these
acts
of
misconduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wulf,
your
time
is
up
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
and
if
you
please
confine
yourself
just
to
answering
questions
of
any
members
of
the
court
at
this
stage.
do
you
claim
that
in
this
record
anywhere,
there
is
evidence
of
the
filing
of
the
kind
of
petition
that
was
alluded
to
in
paragraphs
4,
5,
6,
or
7
or
any
other
part
of
that
petition
which
created
all
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
when
--
that
that's
statement
refers
to
the
kind
of
a
petition
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
question
i
put
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
can't
read
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
can
relate
only
to
the
judge's
refusal
to
let
the
four
judges
testify
on
the
grounds
that
you
said
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
look
on
page
21
of
your
appendix,
you'll
see
that
judge
williams
asked
him
whether
there
was
anything
else
he
had
to
offer
and
said
at
the
top
of
page
21,
the
court
feels,
he
will
be
glad
to
see
what
you
have
to
offer.
and
he
said,
he
couldn't
find
it
for
a
few
minutes.
the
judge
gave
him
a
recess
for
five
minutes.
and
all
he
came
back
with
after
the
five
minute
recess
was
that
he
would
like
to
point
out
some
further
cases,
some
citations,
not
facts,
not
documents,
not
reference
to
any
kind
of
a
petition
that
supported
his
statement
in
paragraph
4
or
5?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
it
was
incumbent
on
mr.
spencer
at
some
time
to
produce
that
and
put
it
on
the
record
so
that
you
could
have
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
can't
see
how
it's
possible
to
read
judge
williams
statement
as
meaning
what
you
say
it
means
but
only
relating
to
the
testimony
of
the
four
judges
which
he
excluded
on
the
ground
that
the
justification
was
not
admissible
evidence.
but
if
any
such
document,
if
you
wish
to
supplement
this
record,
i
think
we
would
invite
you
to
supplement
the
record
in
that
regard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you,
