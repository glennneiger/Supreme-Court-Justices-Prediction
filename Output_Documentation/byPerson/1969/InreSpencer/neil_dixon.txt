mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
address
ourselves
first
the
jurisdictional
problem.
we
submit
that
even
treating
the
petition
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
does
not
cross
the
jurisdictional
issues
raised
here.
we
have
briefed
the
issue
that
appeal
was
from
the
wrong
court.
the
same
holdings,
same
cases
creating
these
rules
were
also
had
held
that
certiorari
is
from
the
wrong
court.
jurisdiction
here
is
based
only
on
section
12
(57)
either
for
appeal
or
for
certiorari
requiring
that
it
be
from
“the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had.
this
court
has
of
many
occasions
in
the
cases
cited
on
the
jade
of
brief
held
that
when
a
higher
state
court
declines
discretionary
review
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
my
intention
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
dixon
oh,
it
is
--
it
may
have
been
at
one
time,
i
do
not
know
but
that
is
not
my
opinion
of
louisiana
law,
i
would
direct
your
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
honors
attention
to
the
case
cited
by
us
on
page
8
of
american
express
company
versus
levee
came
from
louisiana
in
which
that
same
situation
existed
as
i
recall.
mr.
neil
dixon
as
i
recall
also
in
levee
that
question
was
asked
in
this
court.
i
think
the
court
said
we
find
no
error
of
law
so
this
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
this
court
was
wondering
what
that
--
in
that
or
somebody
raised
the
issue.
again,
the
american
express
company
versus
levee,
the
case
came
out
of
the
second
circuit,
louisiana
court
of
appeals.
certiorari
was
applied
to
louisiana
supreme
court
certiorari
denied,
writs
applied
to
here
from
the
louisiana
circuit,
second
circuit
court
of
appeal.
the
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
saying
that
it
--
the
writ
should
have
come
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
this
court
said
that
the
writs
properly
laid
to
the
court
of
appeal,
not
the
highest
court
declining
it's
a
discretionary
review.
in
the
instant
case,
the
highest
court
--
involved
is
the
first
judicial
district
court
of
caddo
parish,
louisiana.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
court.
no
notice
of
appeal
and
conformity
with
the
rules
of
this
court,
it
was
filed
within
the
first
judicial
district
court.
the
record
of
the
first
judicial
district
court
has
never
been
filed
in
these
proceedings
except
by
respondent
trial
judge,
judge
williams,
against
support
of
his
motion
to
dismiss.
appellant
has
not
complied
either,
we
submit
with
the
statute
or
with
the
rules
of
this
court
or
either
certiorari
or
for
appeal
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
this
case
is
not
properly
before
this
court
on
any
issue.
mr.
neil
dixon
the
record
was
not
filed,
your
honor.
the
record
in
this
case
was
filed
by
appellee
so
that
this
court
could
pass
on
appellee
or
respondent
(inaudible)
motion
to
dismiss.
record
has
never
been
filed
here
by
appellant
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
neil
dixon
there
were
other
attachments
to
that
petition.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
its
own
rules
as
to
what
goes
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
but
it
does
not
include
everything,
it
does
not
include
the
whole
record.
it
does
not
include
what
is
printed
in
the
appendix
now.
this
appendix
would
not
exist
but
for
the
filing
of
appellee.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
say
or
adequately
raise
under
the
standards
of
this
court.
in
fairness
to
appellant,
there
was
another
place
other
than
pointed
out
in
which
an
issue
was
raised
and
we
refer
to
you
on
page
13
of
the
appendix.
mr.
neil
dixon
page
13
your
honor.
in
article
4
of
his
response
to
the
rule,
you
said,
in
further
defense
of
the
rule,
respondent
place
the
truth
of
all
the
charges
against
judge
dixon
on
the
motion
to
recuse.
the
hearing
above
describe
expressions
by
respondent
are
constitutionality
protected
exercise
of
free
speech.
that's
the
only
other
point
than
those
pointed
out
by
appellant
that
any
constitutional
issue
was
raised
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
been
adequately
raised
below.
no,
sir.
we
would
proceed
then
assuming
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction,
first
i
would
like
to
mention
the
statement
of
the
case,
appellant
claimed
in
his
first
jurisdictional
statement
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
introduce
testimony
concerning
the
proof,
the
charge
--
the
truth
of
the
charges
made
against
judge
dixon.
we
refer
the
court
to
appendix,
page
22.
we
have
a
full
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
contempt.
appellant
was
not
denied
the
right
to
introduce
any
covered
evidence
other
than
evidence
of
testimony
of
the
co-judges
of
judge
dixon
in
an
attempt
to
inquire
into
the
motive
of
judge
dixon
for
filing
the
contempt.
appellant
was
asked
by
judge
williams,
“have
you
anything
else
to
offer?”
appellant
said,
“no.”
at
no
time
has
appellant
attempted
to
introduce
any
evidence.
at
no
time
has
he
been
denied
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
i
think
you
must
be
the
arbiter
of
which
one
of
us
is
right.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
judge
williams
is
trying
to
contempt.
judge
dixon
is
not.
mr.
neil
dixon
this
is
---
mr.
neil
dixon
--
the
status
of
every
contempt
hearing
that
has
ever
been
held,
every
direct
contempt
hearing
that
has
ever
been
held
in
the
history
of
direct
contempt,
it
is
a
question
between
the
court
and
the
counsel
or
the
court
and
the
party.
mr.
neil
dixon
this
is
a
different
judge.
mr.
neil
dixon
because
if
contempt
is
always
between
the
court
and
counsel
or
the
court
and
the
contemptor.
when
the
judge
says
it
is
between
you,
he
means
the
contemptor
and
me,
he
means
the
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
does
not
mean
r.
b.
williams,
judge,
he
means
the
first
judicial
district
court,
a
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
every
contempt
cite
--
every
contempt
conviction
that
this
court
has
sustained
in
history
has
been
between
the
court
and
the
counsel.
i'll
refer
you
to
sacher,
that
it
--
that
probably
the
most
famous
case
of
contempt
to
come
before
this
court.
came
out
of
the
dennis
trial.
it
was
between
judge
medina
and
sacher.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
didn't
say
it,
your
honor
he
simply
(voice
overlap).
mr.
neil
dixon
--
and
sentenced
him
to
jail.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
other
party
at
interest
other
than
the
official
body
of
the
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
yes.
yes
sir,
that
is
my
view
of
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
--
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir.
now
it
may
say
it
elsewhere,
i
don't
know
what
page
justice
marshall
is
quoting
from.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
starts
out
with
(voice
overlap)
saying
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
other
party
in
interest
other
than
the
official
body
of
the
court
as
i
see
it
which
is
in
the
middle
of
page
14.
which
is
what
every
contempt
case
is
and
i
think
that
judge
williams
has
done
nothing
more
than
say
that.
that's
what
sacher
was.
that
was
sustained
by
this
court.
that's
what
terry
was
cited
in
our
brief.
that
was
sustained
by
this
court
that
came
out
of
texas.
that's
what
every
direct
contempt
is.
it
was
only
in
the
rare
instance
that
you
have
an
out
of
court
contempt
with
proof
elements
that
a
court
calls
on
counsel.
now,
throughout
the
nation,
i
don't
know
of
any
general
practice
of
a
court
calling
on
counsel
to
handle
direct
contempts.
certainly
in
no
reported
decision
of
this
court
has
that
been
the
case
that
i
have
ever
been
able
to
find
in
a
direct
contempt
case.
i
have
noticed
an
order
from
this
court
doing
it,
yes
sir
in
a
contempt
citation.
mr.
neil
dixon
but
we
have
a
trial
by
another
judge
here,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir,
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i'm
talking
about
hiring
about
the
court
appointing
counsel
to
prosecute
which
seems
to
be
what
your
honor
is
intimating.
mr.
neil
dixon
because
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
--
the
judge
making
the
contempt
citation
hearing
it,
this
is
another
judge
hearing
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
under
this
circumstance.
mr.
neil
dixon
we
have
first
a
multiple
court
judge
in
the
first
judicial
district
court.
we
had
an
attorney
who
did
not
like
a
ruling
of
the
judge.
the
ruling
was
correct
but
the
attorney
didn't
like
it.
so
the
attorney
wanted
to
try
again
before
anther
judge.
so
he
advises
the
judge
who
has
no
other
way
of
knowing
it.
he
advises
the
judge
that
judge
my
clients
think
you
are
corrupt
therefore
recuse
yourself.
mr.
neil
dixon
like
you
need
two
things,
you'd
need
--
mr.
neil
dixon
those
facts
haven't
set
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
think
that
the
judge
--
that
the
counsel
must
have
alleged,
louisiana
is
a
fact
pleading
state.
it
is
not
a
--
what
do
you
call
it
in
common
law,
issue
pleading.
louisiana
is
a
fact
pleading.
you
have
omitted
the
essential
fact
and
that
is
you
judge
are
aware
that
my
client
thinks
you
are
corrupt.
are
you
judge
are
aware
that
my
client
has
filed
a
petition
against
you.
mr.
neil
dixon
now,
put
that
in
--
he
cannot
be
held
for
contempt.
now
he
may
be
guilty
of
certain
other
disciplinary
action
but
put
that
in
and
he
cannot
be
held
for
contempt.
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
i
say
he
does
--
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
let
me
back
up.
the
corruption
is
unnecessary
to
the
first
charge,
is
unnecessary
to
the
plea.
all
he
has
to
say
is,
i
have
filed
a
motion
for
your
--
or
my
clients
are
seeking
your
removal
and
i've
filed
a
petition
for
your
removal.
he
never
has
to
repeat
the
allegation
corruption
anywhere
in
order
to
achieve
his
ends,
that
is
obtain
the
recusation.
anytime
he
uses
the
word
corruption
under
our
pleading
he
is
using
a
word
that
is
irrelevant
to
his
pleading
and
is
irrelevant
--
criticism
of
a
trial
judge.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
and
i
would
say
this,
there's
talk
in
the
brief
about
it
being
a
lawyerlike
language.
it
is
no
more
lawyerlike
than
to
file
a
motion
before
a
court
saying
the
court
should
recuse
itself
because
it's
guilty
of
murder,
burglary,
rape
or
what
have
you.
all
of
these
terms
are
lawyerlike
when
used
in
the
proper
context,
every
one
of
them.
but
words
that
a
lawyer
uses
in
one
case
may
not
be
appropriate
to
another
case.
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
charge
is
the
one
foundation
and
we
submit
the
only
foundation
laid
down
by
this
court
in
holt
versus
virginia,
appellant
has
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i
think,
your
honor
you
--
if
we
take
that
exact
quotation
that
you
used
and
nothing
more.
i
think
that
it
could
be.
you
know
that
my
client
has
charged
you
with
you
corruption.
now
we
have
here
a
different
circumstances,
we
say
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
we
say,
filed
a
--
or
attempting
to
remove
you
from
office
but
just
limited
to
the
words
that
you
used.
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
it
could
not
be
contempt.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
be
alright.
we
do
not
have
that
issue
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
alright
because
then
the
word
corrupt
is
unnecessary
to
the
pleading.
in
your
first
time
with
it
the
word
was
necessary
to
the
pleading.
here
it
is,
is
not
necessary.
the
standard
that
this
court
said
in
holt
--
set
in
holt
versus
virginia
was
whether
or
not
the
language
was
appropriate,
the
wording
by
this
court
was
wholly
appropriate
to
the
charge
made.
now
we
submit
that
our
read
--
in
our
reading
of
holt
versus
virginia,
this
court
does
not
reach
or
come
close
to
reaching
a
free
speech
issue
and
that
holt
versus
virginia
cannot
be
relied
on
as
ever
having
raised
a
free
speech
issue.
holt
versus
virginia
dealt
with
a
very
basic,
basic
right,
our
right
which
louisiana
grants
by
statute
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
litigant
to
a
trial
before
a
fair
tribunal.
for
attempting
to
exercise
that
right
in
virginia,
mr.
holt
was
cited
for
contempt.
louisiana
spells
out
the
methods
of
exercising
that
right.
we
have
such
things
as
motions
for
recusal.
we
have
motions
for
change
of
venue.
in
holt
versus
virginia,
the
language
wasn't
a
change
of
venue.
i
would
urge
that
your
--
that
your
honors
review
the
language
used
in
holt
and
compare
it
with
the
language
used
by
mr.
spencer.
the
language
used
in
holt
is
quoted
in
appellants
brief
on
page
13
and
14
and
we
submit
is
--
takes
it
entirely
out
of
the
realm
of
with
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
the
instant
case.
the
charge
made
in
holt
was
entirely
appropriate
to
a
charge
of
bias.
the
strongest
language
used
in
holt
versus
virginia
that
could
have
possibly
been
considered
as
impinging
upon
the
sensitivities
of
the
trial
judge
was
that
the
trial
had
been
intimidating
counsel.
but
now
that
allegation
under
certain
circumstances
might
be
contempt.
but
it
could
never
be
direct
contempt
when
filed
in
a
petition
to
recuse.
if
a
judge
has
been
intimidating
counsel,
counsel
is
entitled
to
have
the
judge
recuse.
mr.
neil
dixon
in
holt
versus
virginia.
mr.
neil
dixon
the
exact
language,
your
honor
is
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor
first,
i
would
not
limit
it
to
the
--
to
one
group
of
words
in
the
motion
because
the
order
of
contempt
does
not
so
limit
it.
the
order
of
contempt
refers
to
the
petition
as
a
whole
and
then
says
particularly
article
4
thereof
on
pages
8
and
9
in
which
the
words
are
repeated,
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
the
--
at
the
very
top
of
page
9,
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
these
words
are
also
conclusion,
words
of
conclusion.
i
mention
before
we
are
a
fact-pleading
state
not
an
issue-pleading
state.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
motion
connecting
any
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
or
misfeasance
with
the
trial
of
the
separation
suit
then
pending
before
the
court.
these
words
do
not
have
to
be
contempt
if
under
some
wild
set
of
facts.
a
--
the
corruption
of
a
judge
has
some
connexity
with
the
litigation
pending
before
it.
but
absent
such
connexity
which
we
submit
that
these
words
are
in
of
themselves
offensive
and
the
word
offensive
again
is
the
word
of
this
court
in
holt
versus
virginia.
in
holt
versus
virginia,
they
said
the
words
of
counsel
are
not
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
we
submit
that
with
these
words
as
here
used
are
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
the
fact
that
a
word
may
be
contained
in
a
statute
or
a
constitution
does
not
mean
that
within
all
context
it
cannot
be
offensive
in
and
of
itself.
the
fact
that
favoritism,
corruption,
murder
and
rape
may
be
all
statutory
words
does
not
mean
that
they
cannot
be
words
if
used
in
a
charge
against
a
judge
that
are
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor?
mr.
neil
dixon
the
plaintiff
herein,
luis
b.
hopkins
and
his
chief
witness
in
this
cause,
charles
anderson
are
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of.
your
honor
this
allegation
was
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
made
on
march
the
21st.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
it
was
not
true.
mr.
neil
dixon
throughout
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
the
protracted
collateral
federal
proceedings
and
throughout
this
proceeding
there
is
nothing
anywhere
to
indicate
that
mr.
hopkins
or
mr.
anderson
even
had
any
ill-will
to
judge
dixon.
mr.
neil
dixon
it
is
alleged
that
mr.
hopkins
and
mr.
anderson
are
attempting
to
have
him
removed
from
office
throughout
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
that
was
not
true,
i've
been
attempting
not
to
get
beyond
the
record.
judge
dixon
of
course
is
my
brother
but
that
was
not
true.
mr.
neil
dixon
they
have
certainly
did
not
made
that
statement
in
court,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir.
we
don't
know
what
it
referred
to.
now,
presumably
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
think
it
was
true,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
petition
for
his
removal
filed.
mr.
neil
dixon
to
my
knowledge
they
did
not.
may
i
point
this
out
your
honor,
it
takes
but
25
irate
litigants
within
a
large
metropolitan
area
to
file
a
mandatory
petition
for
removal
with
the
attorney
general.
such
a
petition
was
never
filed.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
no
where.
mr.
neil
dixon
they
have
never
proceeded,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
any
where
or
time
or
place.
mr.
neil
dixon
only
to
this
extent.
we
argue
it
your
honor
to
this
extent
only.
on
march
the
20th,
the
day
of
the
separation
hearing,
there
must
have
existed
no
ground
for
recusation
for
if
they
did,
counsel
was
remiss
in
not
having
filed
his
motion
within
24
hours,
counsel
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
then
raises
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
sir?
mr.
neil
dixon
it
depends
on
what
the
line
between
inference
and
showing.
my
view
is
that
it
shows
--
i
think
your
view
would
be
that
it
infers
it,
your
honor.
it
infers
it
only
that
it
no
time
in
either
the
federal
court
proceeding
which
is
fully
reported
we
might
add.
or
in
this
proceeding,
the
trial
of
which
took
place
about
18
months
after
the
occurrence.
was
there
ever
again
any
mention
of
the
existence
of
such
a
petition?
during
the
federal
court
litigation
with
the
intending
--
with
the
attendant
ill-publicity
judge
dixon
was
elected
by
the
voters
of
his
district
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
hardly
an
event
consistent
with
an
action
for
his
removal
for
corruption,
favoritism
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
mr.
neil
dixon
in
defense
of
the
voters
of
the
city
of
shreveport,
your
honor,
it
never
helps
to
be
accused
of
corruption
under
any
circumstances
anytime.
mr.
neil
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
he
did
not
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
very
significant
fact.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
spencer
subpoenaed
the
three
co-judges
or
four
co-judges
of
judge
dixon.
those
who
sat
on
the
bench
with
him
and
wanted
to
ask
them
specific
questions
set
out
in
the
record
to
establish
--
mr.
neil
dixon
to
ask
them
the
questions
he's
--
he
was
given
the
opportunity
your
honor.
judge
williams
said,
“what
do
you
want
to
prove
by
it,
mr.
spencer?”
he
said,
“here's
what
i
want
to
prove
by
them.”
the
judge
says,
“that
is
not
admissible.
mr.
spencer,
have
you
anything
else
to
offer?”
mr.
neil
dixon
he
wanted
prove
that
judge
dixon
had
filed
--
had
conferred
with
them
and
filed
a
contempt
charge
without
any
expectation
of
obtaining
a
conviction.
he
had
had
to
make
that
condition
across
the
street,
in
the
federal
court
to
bring
it
--
to
get
him
a
three-judge
court.
and
that
he
wanted
to
file
--
he
said
something
vaguely
about
his
long
disputation
between
himself
and
judge
dixon.
part
of
which
is
reported
in
the
--
its
not
rather
reported
but
a
case
that
arose
out
of
it
was
spencer
versus
dixon
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
mr.
spencer
in
contempt
for
the
same
situation
for
having
called
the
louisiana
supreme
court
corrupt.”
mr.
neil
dixon
at
no
time
did
he
put
on
any
and
there's
no
time
once
he
denied
the
right
to
put
on
any.
and
the
last
fact
we
submit
is
the
significant
fact
that
removes
this
from
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
appellant.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
address
ourselves
first
the
jurisdictional
problem.
we
submit
that
even
treating
the
petition
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
does
not
cross
the
jurisdictional
issues
raised
here.
we
have
briefed
the
issue
that
appeal
was
from
the
wrong
court.
the
same
holdings,
same
cases
creating
these
rules
were
also
had
held
that
certiorari
is
from
the
wrong
court.
jurisdiction
here
is
based
only
on
section
12
(57)
either
for
appeal
or
for
certiorari
requiring
that
it
be
from
“the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had.
this
court
has
of
many
occasions
in
the
cases
cited
on
the
jade
of
brief
held
that
when
a
higher
state
court
declines
discretionary
review
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
my
intention
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
dixon
oh,
it
is
--
it
may
have
been
at
one
time,
i
do
not
know
but
that
is
not
my
opinion
of
louisiana
law,
i
would
direct
your
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
honors
attention
to
the
case
cited
by
us
on
page
8
of
american
express
company
versus
levee
came
from
louisiana
in
which
that
same
situation
existed
as
i
recall.
mr.
neil
dixon
as
i
recall
also
in
levee
that
question
was
asked
in
this
court.
i
think
the
court
said
we
find
no
error
of
law
so
this
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
this
court
was
wondering
what
that
--
in
that
or
somebody
raised
the
issue.
again,
the
american
express
company
versus
levee,
the
case
came
out
of
the
second
circuit,
louisiana
court
of
appeals.
certiorari
was
applied
to
louisiana
supreme
court
certiorari
denied,
writs
applied
to
here
from
the
louisiana
circuit,
second
circuit
court
of
appeal.
the
appellee
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
saying
that
it
--
the
writ
should
have
come
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
this
court
said
that
the
writs
properly
laid
to
the
court
of
appeal,
not
the
highest
court
declining
it's
a
discretionary
review.
in
the
instant
case,
the
highest
court
--
involved
is
the
first
judicial
district
court
of
caddo
parish,
louisiana.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
court.
no
notice
of
appeal
and
conformity
with
the
rules
of
this
court,
it
was
filed
within
the
first
judicial
district
court.
the
record
of
the
first
judicial
district
court
has
never
been
filed
in
these
proceedings
except
by
respondent
trial
judge,
judge
williams,
against
support
of
his
motion
to
dismiss.
appellant
has
not
complied
either,
we
submit
with
the
statute
or
with
the
rules
of
this
court
or
either
certiorari
or
for
appeal
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
this
case
is
not
properly
before
this
court
on
any
issue.
mr.
neil
dixon
the
record
was
not
filed,
your
honor.
the
record
in
this
case
was
filed
by
appellee
so
that
this
court
could
pass
on
appellee
or
respondent
(inaudible)
motion
to
dismiss.
record
has
never
been
filed
here
by
appellant
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
neil
dixon
there
were
other
attachments
to
that
petition.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
its
own
rules
as
to
what
goes
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
but
it
does
not
include
everything,
it
does
not
include
the
whole
record.
it
does
not
include
what
is
printed
in
the
appendix
now.
this
appendix
would
not
exist
but
for
the
filing
of
appellee.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
say
or
adequately
raise
under
the
standards
of
this
court.
in
fairness
to
appellant,
there
was
another
place
other
than
pointed
out
in
which
an
issue
was
raised
and
we
refer
to
you
on
page
13
of
the
appendix.
mr.
neil
dixon
page
13
your
honor.
in
article
4
of
his
response
to
the
rule,
you
said,
in
further
defense
of
the
rule,
respondent
place
the
truth
of
all
the
charges
against
judge
dixon
on
the
motion
to
recuse.
the
hearing
above
describe
expressions
by
respondent
are
constitutionality
protected
exercise
of
free
speech.
that's
the
only
other
point
than
those
pointed
out
by
appellant
that
any
constitutional
issue
was
raised
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
been
adequately
raised
below.
no,
sir.
we
would
proceed
then
assuming
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction,
first
i
would
like
to
mention
the
statement
of
the
case,
appellant
claimed
in
his
first
jurisdictional
statement
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
introduce
testimony
concerning
the
proof,
the
charge
--
the
truth
of
the
charges
made
against
judge
dixon.
we
refer
the
court
to
appendix,
page
22.
we
have
a
full
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
contempt.
appellant
was
not
denied
the
right
to
introduce
any
covered
evidence
other
than
evidence
of
testimony
of
the
co-judges
of
judge
dixon
in
an
attempt
to
inquire
into
the
motive
of
judge
dixon
for
filing
the
contempt.
appellant
was
asked
by
judge
williams,
“have
you
anything
else
to
offer?”
appellant
said,
“no.”
at
no
time
has
appellant
attempted
to
introduce
any
evidence.
at
no
time
has
he
been
denied
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
i
think
you
must
be
the
arbiter
of
which
one
of
us
is
right.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
judge
williams
is
trying
to
contempt.
judge
dixon
is
not.
mr.
neil
dixon
this
is
---
mr.
neil
dixon
--
the
status
of
every
contempt
hearing
that
has
ever
been
held,
every
direct
contempt
hearing
that
has
ever
been
held
in
the
history
of
direct
contempt,
it
is
a
question
between
the
court
and
the
counsel
or
the
court
and
the
party.
mr.
neil
dixon
this
is
a
different
judge.
mr.
neil
dixon
because
if
contempt
is
always
between
the
court
and
counsel
or
the
court
and
the
contemptor.
when
the
judge
says
it
is
between
you,
he
means
the
contemptor
and
me,
he
means
the
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
does
not
mean
r.
b.
williams,
judge,
he
means
the
first
judicial
district
court,
a
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
every
contempt
cite
--
every
contempt
conviction
that
this
court
has
sustained
in
history
has
been
between
the
court
and
the
counsel.
i'll
refer
you
to
sacher,
that
it
--
that
probably
the
most
famous
case
of
contempt
to
come
before
this
court.
came
out
of
the
dennis
trial.
it
was
between
judge
medina
and
sacher.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
didn't
say
it,
your
honor
he
simply
(voice
overlap).
mr.
neil
dixon
--
and
sentenced
him
to
jail.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
other
party
at
interest
other
than
the
official
body
of
the
court.
mr.
neil
dixon
yes.
yes
sir,
that
is
my
view
of
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
--
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir.
now
it
may
say
it
elsewhere,
i
don't
know
what
page
justice
marshall
is
quoting
from.
mr.
neil
dixon
he
starts
out
with
(voice
overlap)
saying
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
other
party
in
interest
other
than
the
official
body
of
the
court
as
i
see
it
which
is
in
the
middle
of
page
14.
which
is
what
every
contempt
case
is
and
i
think
that
judge
williams
has
done
nothing
more
than
say
that.
that's
what
sacher
was.
that
was
sustained
by
this
court.
that's
what
terry
was
cited
in
our
brief.
that
was
sustained
by
this
court
that
came
out
of
texas.
that's
what
every
direct
contempt
is.
it
was
only
in
the
rare
instance
that
you
have
an
out
of
court
contempt
with
proof
elements
that
a
court
calls
on
counsel.
now,
throughout
the
nation,
i
don't
know
of
any
general
practice
of
a
court
calling
on
counsel
to
handle
direct
contempts.
certainly
in
no
reported
decision
of
this
court
has
that
been
the
case
that
i
have
ever
been
able
to
find
in
a
direct
contempt
case.
i
have
noticed
an
order
from
this
court
doing
it,
yes
sir
in
a
contempt
citation.
mr.
neil
dixon
but
we
have
a
trial
by
another
judge
here,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir,
i
am
talking
about
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i'm
talking
about
hiring
about
the
court
appointing
counsel
to
prosecute
which
seems
to
be
what
your
honor
is
intimating.
mr.
neil
dixon
because
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
the
trial
judge.
the
trial
--
the
judge
making
the
contempt
citation
hearing
it,
this
is
another
judge
hearing
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
under
this
circumstance.
mr.
neil
dixon
we
have
first
a
multiple
court
judge
in
the
first
judicial
district
court.
we
had
an
attorney
who
did
not
like
a
ruling
of
the
judge.
the
ruling
was
correct
but
the
attorney
didn't
like
it.
so
the
attorney
wanted
to
try
again
before
anther
judge.
so
he
advises
the
judge
who
has
no
other
way
of
knowing
it.
he
advises
the
judge
that
judge
my
clients
think
you
are
corrupt
therefore
recuse
yourself.
mr.
neil
dixon
like
you
need
two
things,
you'd
need
--
mr.
neil
dixon
those
facts
haven't
set
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
think
that
the
judge
--
that
the
counsel
must
have
alleged,
louisiana
is
a
fact
pleading
state.
it
is
not
a
--
what
do
you
call
it
in
common
law,
issue
pleading.
louisiana
is
a
fact
pleading.
you
have
omitted
the
essential
fact
and
that
is
you
judge
are
aware
that
my
client
thinks
you
are
corrupt.
are
you
judge
are
aware
that
my
client
has
filed
a
petition
against
you.
mr.
neil
dixon
now,
put
that
in
--
he
cannot
be
held
for
contempt.
now
he
may
be
guilty
of
certain
other
disciplinary
action
but
put
that
in
and
he
cannot
be
held
for
contempt.
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
i
say
he
does
--
mr.
neil
dixon
well,
let
me
back
up.
the
corruption
is
unnecessary
to
the
first
charge,
is
unnecessary
to
the
plea.
all
he
has
to
say
is,
i
have
filed
a
motion
for
your
--
or
my
clients
are
seeking
your
removal
and
i've
filed
a
petition
for
your
removal.
he
never
has
to
repeat
the
allegation
corruption
anywhere
in
order
to
achieve
his
ends,
that
is
obtain
the
recusation.
anytime
he
uses
the
word
corruption
under
our
pleading
he
is
using
a
word
that
is
irrelevant
to
his
pleading
and
is
irrelevant
--
criticism
of
a
trial
judge.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
and
i
would
say
this,
there's
talk
in
the
brief
about
it
being
a
lawyerlike
language.
it
is
no
more
lawyerlike
than
to
file
a
motion
before
a
court
saying
the
court
should
recuse
itself
because
it's
guilty
of
murder,
burglary,
rape
or
what
have
you.
all
of
these
terms
are
lawyerlike
when
used
in
the
proper
context,
every
one
of
them.
but
words
that
a
lawyer
uses
in
one
case
may
not
be
appropriate
to
another
case.
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
charge
is
the
one
foundation
and
we
submit
the
only
foundation
laid
down
by
this
court
in
holt
versus
virginia,
appellant
has
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i
think,
your
honor
you
--
if
we
take
that
exact
quotation
that
you
used
and
nothing
more.
i
think
that
it
could
be.
you
know
that
my
client
has
charged
you
with
you
corruption.
now
we
have
here
a
different
circumstances,
we
say
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
we
say,
filed
a
--
or
attempting
to
remove
you
from
office
but
just
limited
to
the
words
that
you
used.
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
it
could
not
be
contempt.
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
be
alright.
we
do
not
have
that
issue
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
alright
because
then
the
word
corrupt
is
unnecessary
to
the
pleading.
in
your
first
time
with
it
the
word
was
necessary
to
the
pleading.
here
it
is,
is
not
necessary.
the
standard
that
this
court
said
in
holt
--
set
in
holt
versus
virginia
was
whether
or
not
the
language
was
appropriate,
the
wording
by
this
court
was
wholly
appropriate
to
the
charge
made.
now
we
submit
that
our
read
--
in
our
reading
of
holt
versus
virginia,
this
court
does
not
reach
or
come
close
to
reaching
a
free
speech
issue
and
that
holt
versus
virginia
cannot
be
relied
on
as
ever
having
raised
a
free
speech
issue.
holt
versus
virginia
dealt
with
a
very
basic,
basic
right,
our
right
which
louisiana
grants
by
statute
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
litigant
to
a
trial
before
a
fair
tribunal.
for
attempting
to
exercise
that
right
in
virginia,
mr.
holt
was
cited
for
contempt.
louisiana
spells
out
the
methods
of
exercising
that
right.
we
have
such
things
as
motions
for
recusal.
we
have
motions
for
change
of
venue.
in
holt
versus
virginia,
the
language
wasn't
a
change
of
venue.
i
would
urge
that
your
--
that
your
honors
review
the
language
used
in
holt
and
compare
it
with
the
language
used
by
mr.
spencer.
the
language
used
in
holt
is
quoted
in
appellants
brief
on
page
13
and
14
and
we
submit
is
--
takes
it
entirely
out
of
the
realm
of
with
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
the
instant
case.
the
charge
made
in
holt
was
entirely
appropriate
to
a
charge
of
bias.
the
strongest
language
used
in
holt
versus
virginia
that
could
have
possibly
been
considered
as
impinging
upon
the
sensitivities
of
the
trial
judge
was
that
the
trial
had
been
intimidating
counsel.
but
now
that
allegation
under
certain
circumstances
might
be
contempt.
but
it
could
never
be
direct
contempt
when
filed
in
a
petition
to
recuse.
if
a
judge
has
been
intimidating
counsel,
counsel
is
entitled
to
have
the
judge
recuse.
mr.
neil
dixon
in
holt
versus
virginia.
mr.
neil
dixon
the
exact
language,
your
honor
is
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor
first,
i
would
not
limit
it
to
the
--
to
one
group
of
words
in
the
motion
because
the
order
of
contempt
does
not
so
limit
it.
the
order
of
contempt
refers
to
the
petition
as
a
whole
and
then
says
particularly
article
4
thereof
on
pages
8
and
9
in
which
the
words
are
repeated,
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
the
--
at
the
very
top
of
page
9,
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
these
words
are
also
conclusion,
words
of
conclusion.
i
mention
before
we
are
a
fact-pleading
state
not
an
issue-pleading
state.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
motion
connecting
any
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
or
misfeasance
with
the
trial
of
the
separation
suit
then
pending
before
the
court.
these
words
do
not
have
to
be
contempt
if
under
some
wild
set
of
facts.
a
--
the
corruption
of
a
judge
has
some
connexity
with
the
litigation
pending
before
it.
but
absent
such
connexity
which
we
submit
that
these
words
are
in
of
themselves
offensive
and
the
word
offensive
again
is
the
word
of
this
court
in
holt
versus
virginia.
in
holt
versus
virginia,
they
said
the
words
of
counsel
are
not
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
we
submit
that
with
these
words
as
here
used
are
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
the
fact
that
a
word
may
be
contained
in
a
statute
or
a
constitution
does
not
mean
that
within
all
context
it
cannot
be
offensive
in
and
of
itself.
the
fact
that
favoritism,
corruption,
murder
and
rape
may
be
all
statutory
words
does
not
mean
that
they
cannot
be
words
if
used
in
a
charge
against
a
judge
that
are
offensive
in
and
of
themselves.
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor?
mr.
neil
dixon
the
plaintiff
herein,
luis
b.
hopkins
and
his
chief
witness
in
this
cause,
charles
anderson
are
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of.
your
honor
this
allegation
was
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
made
on
march
the
21st.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
it
was
not
true.
mr.
neil
dixon
throughout
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
the
protracted
collateral
federal
proceedings
and
throughout
this
proceeding
there
is
nothing
anywhere
to
indicate
that
mr.
hopkins
or
mr.
anderson
even
had
any
ill-will
to
judge
dixon.
mr.
neil
dixon
it
is
alleged
that
mr.
hopkins
and
mr.
anderson
are
attempting
to
have
him
removed
from
office
throughout
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
--
mr.
neil
dixon
your
honor,
that
was
not
true,
i've
been
attempting
not
to
get
beyond
the
record.
judge
dixon
of
course
is
my
brother
but
that
was
not
true.
mr.
neil
dixon
they
have
certainly
did
not
made
that
statement
in
court,
your
honor.
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir.
we
don't
know
what
it
referred
to.
now,
presumably
--
mr.
neil
dixon
i
do
not
think
it
was
true,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
petition
for
his
removal
filed.
mr.
neil
dixon
to
my
knowledge
they
did
not.
may
i
point
this
out
your
honor,
it
takes
but
25
irate
litigants
within
a
large
metropolitan
area
to
file
a
mandatory
petition
for
removal
with
the
attorney
general.
such
a
petition
was
never
filed.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
no
where.
mr.
neil
dixon
they
have
never
proceeded,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
dixon
any
where
or
time
or
place.
mr.
neil
dixon
only
to
this
extent.
we
argue
it
your
honor
to
this
extent
only.
on
march
the
20th,
the
day
of
the
separation
hearing,
there
must
have
existed
no
ground
for
recusation
for
if
they
did,
counsel
was
remiss
in
not
having
filed
his
motion
within
24
hours,
counsel
--
mr.
neil
dixon
--
then
raises
it.
mr.
neil
dixon
sir?
mr.
neil
dixon
it
depends
on
what
the
line
between
inference
and
showing.
my
view
is
that
it
shows
--
i
think
your
view
would
be
that
it
infers
it,
your
honor.
it
infers
it
only
that
it
no
time
in
either
the
federal
court
proceeding
which
is
fully
reported
we
might
add.
or
in
this
proceeding,
the
trial
of
which
took
place
about
18
months
after
the
occurrence.
was
there
ever
again
any
mention
of
the
existence
of
such
a
petition?
during
the
federal
court
litigation
with
the
intending
--
with
the
attendant
ill-publicity
judge
dixon
was
elected
by
the
voters
of
his
district
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
hardly
an
event
consistent
with
an
action
for
his
removal
for
corruption,
favoritism
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.
mr.
neil
dixon
in
defense
of
the
voters
of
the
city
of
shreveport,
your
honor,
it
never
helps
to
be
accused
of
corruption
under
any
circumstances
anytime.
mr.
neil
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
chief
justice,
he
did
not
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
very
significant
fact.
mr.
neil
dixon
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
dixon
mr.
spencer
subpoenaed
the
three
co-judges
or
four
co-judges
of
judge
dixon.
those
who
sat
on
the
bench
with
him
and
wanted
to
ask
them
specific
questions
set
out
in
the
record
to
establish
--
mr.
neil
dixon
to
ask
them
the
questions
he's
--
he
was
given
the
opportunity
your
honor.
judge
williams
said,
“what
do
you
want
to
prove
by
it,
mr.
spencer?”
he
said,
“here's
what
i
want
to
prove
by
them.”
the
judge
says,
“that
is
not
admissible.
mr.
spencer,
have
you
anything
else
to
offer?”
mr.
neil
dixon
he
wanted
prove
that
judge
dixon
had
filed
--
had
conferred
with
them
and
filed
a
contempt
charge
without
any
expectation
of
obtaining
a
conviction.
he
had
had
to
make
that
condition
across
the
street,
in
the
federal
court
to
bring
it
--
to
get
him
a
three-judge
court.
and
that
he
wanted
to
file
--
he
said
something
vaguely
about
his
long
disputation
between
himself
and
judge
dixon.
part
of
which
is
reported
in
the
--
its
not
rather
reported
but
a
case
that
arose
out
of
it
was
spencer
versus
dixon
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
mr.
spencer
in
contempt
for
the
same
situation
for
having
called
the
louisiana
supreme
court
corrupt.”
mr.
neil
dixon
at
no
time
did
he
put
on
any
and
there's
no
time
once
he
denied
the
right
to
put
on
any.
and
the
last
fact
we
submit
is
the
significant
fact
that
removes
this
from
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
appellant.
thank
you,
your
honors.
