i'm
not
talking
about
whether
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
but
that's
not
what's
alleged
here,
is
it?
what
is
alleged?
justice
hugo

black
as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in

now
was
that
true?
justice

l.
black
well,
i
--
that's
alright
but
i'm
not
asking
if
the
statement
is
true.
i'm
asking
if
the
statement
is
true
that
they
had
made
that
statement
in
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
this
referred
to,
was
it
a
statement
referred
to
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
they
are
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
removed
from
office
being
unfit
therefore,
was
that
true?
justice

black
were
they
not
engaged
in
that
effort?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
not
proceeded
against

justice
hugo
l.
black
at
any

place?
justice

l.
black
now,
is
that
shown
to
be
untrue
in

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
justice

black
--
argument.
justice

black
but
here
is
a
statement
made
and
i
judge
that
what
you
say,
that
is
the
basis
of
the
conviction.
now,
does
the
record
show
that
that
statement
was
not
true
whether
we
just
have
to
infer
it.
justice

sometimes
that
happens
to
men.
you
charge
by
the
right
person.
justice

but
sometimes,
i
have
known
people
that
get
great
benefit
out
of
it
because
it
wasn't
true
and
they
knew
that
the
man
made
it,
you
avoid
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
didn't
the
court
prevent
him
offering
any
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't.
justice
hugo

black
what
was
it
they
kept
him
from
doing
it?
justice

i
thought
the
