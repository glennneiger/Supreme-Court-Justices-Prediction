mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
contempt
--
conviction
of
an
attorney
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
there
--
jurisdiction
was
postponed
pending
argument
on
the
merits
and
there
are
some
jurisdictional
problems.
before
discussing
those,
i
would
like
to
describe
the
facts
of
the
conviction
itself
because
of
the
facts
of
the
conviction
also
involved
some
of
the
jurisdictional
problems.
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
spencer
is
an
attorney,
member
of
the
louisiana
bar
who
appeared
before
a
judge
dixon,
a
district
court
judge
in
the
louisiana
courts
representing
one,
mr.
hopkins
in
a
hearing
in
a
divorce
case.
it
was
an
uncontested
divorce
suit
and
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was,
according
to
louisiana
practice,
to
confirm
default
in
mr.
hopkins
favor.
after
testimony
was
taken
by
--
was
given
by
mr.
hopkins
and
witness
on
his
behalf,
judge
dixon
denied
the
divorce
because
the
testimony
didn't
show
abandonment
by
the
spouse
but
showed
only
that
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins
have
had
argument
and
that
they
decided
that
one
of
them
should
leave
and
mrs.
hopkins
was
the
one
to
leave.
the
following
day
after
the
denial
of
the
divorce,
the
appellant
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
behalf
of
his
client
mr.
hopkins
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
by
judge
dixon
was
erroneous
in
fact
and
in
law.
simultaneously
with
filing
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
he
also
filed
a
motion
to
recuse
judge
dixon.
the
motion
to
recuse
which
he
filed
was
set
out
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
record
doesn't
show,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
oh,
i
don't
know
what
one
--
i
believe
that
one
cannot
draw
inferences
from
the
record
because
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
at
all
to
suggest
when
this
impeachment
proceeding
was
initiated,
if
it
was
initiated
and
was
initiated
and
what
the
--
what
any
of
the
facts
surrounding
that
proceeding
were.
what
if
any
of
the
facts
are
on
that
petition
were
but
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know
it's
true
or
false,
your
honor.
one
of
the
reasons
we
don't
know
whether
it's
true
or
false
is
that
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
contempt
proceeding
itself
the
year
later
wouldn't
allow
any
such
testimony
to
be
entered.
now
the
record
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
any
such
testimony
was
attempted
to
be
put
in
by
the
appellant
but
it
becomes
perfectly
clear
from
the
statement
of
judge
williams
himself
that
he
was
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
contempt
hearing
that
--
and
this
is
contained
in
the
record
of
the
case
and
also
in
the
back
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he,
judge
williams
in
opposing
mr.
spencer's
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
to
louisiana
supreme
court
said
in
and
i
quote,
well,
i'm
sorry
i
don't
quote,
but
in
his
application
with
--
in
his
opposition
to
the
application
which
is
in
the
record,
judge
williams
said
himself
that
he
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence
concerning
the
truth
of
the
assertion
in
the
motion
to
recuse.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know,
i
don't
--
i
think
mr.
hopkins
was
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no
sir,
less
in
about
him
than
about
that
of
mr.
hopkins.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
do
know
that
there
was
then
a
procedure
under
the
louisiana
constitution,
article
9
of
the
constitution
which
provided
that
upon
the
petition
of
any
25
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
alleged
that
a
judge
was
guilty
of
one
of
a
fairly
long
list
of
offenses
ranging
from
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
to
habitual
drunkenness
and
including
incompetency,
corruption,
favoritism,
extortion,
oppression
in
office,
and
gross
misconduct
that
upon
a
filing
of
a
petition
with
the
district
attorney
by
25
citizens
so
alleging
that
the
district
attorney
had
to
initiate
impeachment
proceedings.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
your
honor.
however
that
statute
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
--
this
motion
to
recuse
was
filed
was
repealed
not
long
afterwards.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
was
elevated
to
the
--
to
an
appellate
court
in
louisiana
not
long
after
this
trial
also,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir,
i
am
and
if
i
may
just
finish
the
recital
of
facts
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
motion
to
recuse
contained
the
following
paragraphs.
paragraph
4
and
it's
set
out
at
page
8
of
the
appendix,
the
separate
appendix.
it
says,
“the
plaintiff
herein,
louis
b.
hopkins,
jr.
and
his
chief
witness
in
this
case,
mr.
charles
anderson,
iii
are
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
removed
from
office
as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.”
and
the
next
paragraph
said
that
because
of
the
--
this
activity
by
mr.
hopkins
that
the
judge
is
therefore
interested
in
the
cause
and
bias,
prejudice
and
harbors
personal
animosity
towards
the
plaintiff.
in
the
motion
to
recuse
was
filed
pursuant
to
a
louisiana
statute
which
permits
motions
to
recuse
on
allegations
that
filed.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
nexus
is
that
judge
inferentially
knowing
about
the
motion
to
impeach
about
the
proceeding
to
impeach
initiated
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
would
necessarily
be
biased
against
him
on
the
fair
assumption
that
it
certainly
isn't
something
that
we're
going
endear
the
plaintiff
to
the
judge.
that
--
and
that
was
the
essence
of
the
claim
of
bias
and
personal
animosity,
a
fair
implication,
i
would
think.
this
motion
to
recuse
having
been
filed
the
judge
several
days
later
issued
an
order
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
why
appellant,
mr.
spencer
what
not
be
held
in
contempt.
and
the
order
is
set
out
in
page
10
of
the
appendix,
it's
very
brief
and
it
says
using
the
language
of
the
louisiana
contempt
statute
that
he
did
file
a
pleading
which
contains
scandalous,
insulting
and
abusive
language
and
a
relevant
criticism
of
the
judge
of
said
court,
which
pleading
is
attached
hereto
and
made
a
part
hereof
in
which
language
particularly
in
paragraph
4
which
is
the
paragraph
i
read
relating
to
the
impeachment
proceedings
thereof,
impairs
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
the
respect
for
his
authority
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
at
that
point
the
appellant
here
initiated
collateral
proceedings,
united
states
district
court
of
louisiana
to
enjoin
the
contempt
proceedings.
i
don't
think
that's
directly
relevant
now.
that
was
an
attack
on
the
sta
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
collateral
actions,
your
honor?
that
was
an
1983
civil
rights
action
based
partially
on
dombrowski
v.
pfister
to
enjoin
the
contempt
proceeding
against
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
afraid
i
can't
recall,
the
free
speech,
yes,
precisely.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
alleged
a
free
--
he
alleged
that
the
statute
--
louisiana
contempt
statute
violated
the
first
amendment
on
its
face.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
decided
against
appellant,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
on
a
summary
judgment,
yes.
there
was
a
--
there
was
initially
a
three-judge
court
and
then
they
--
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
filed
those
on
appeal
and
then
withdrew
it
afterwards,
yes.
another
part
of
that
proceeding
was
that
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
out
of
that
proceeding,
that
judge
dixon
disqualified
himself
from
sitting
on
the
contempt
hearing
itself
and
another
judge
was
assigned
to
actually
hear
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
only
issue
that
was
disposed
of
in
the
federal
court
action
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
contempt
statute
on
its
face
although
that
was
raised
here
initially
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
from
our
supplemental
brief
you'll
see
that
we're
confessing
that
that
ought
not
be
here
because
it
was
not
properly
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
other
issues
by
which
you
mean
the
whole
three
of
the
general
issues,
the
three
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
were
raised
--
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
was
raised
in
the
motion
to
recuse
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
judge
williams
and
in
the
appellant's
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
but
it
was
raised
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
is
on
the
record.
that
was
most
explicitly
raised
in
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
before
judge
williams
at
page
--
well,
its
raised
in
a
couple
of
places.
at
page
18
(voice
overlap)
in
the
appendix
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
first
words
are
holt
versus
virginia,
that's
mr.
spencer
engaging
in
colloquy
with
judge
williams.
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
what
he
--
quote
some
of
the
language
from
the
holt
case
and
then
at
the
conclusion,
it
says
under
these
circumstances,
the
decision
decided
by
8
judges,
the
one
that
said,
the
supreme
court,
meaning
this
court
found
that
these
constitutionally
protected,
expressions
of
free
speech
that
i
would
submit
that
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
the
other
issue
that
he
persistently
raised
was
the
issue
of
his
right
to
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
the
reference
to
holt,
yes,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
addressed
its
--
it
addressed
itself
to
the
charge
against
--
it
addressed
himself
to
the
charge
against
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
are
and
i
have
in
our
supplemental
brief
conceded
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
conceded
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
have
--
we
have
abandoned
the
attack
on
the
contempt
statute
on
its
face
because
in
my
opinion
it
was
impossible
to
assert
that
there
--
that
it
had
been
joined
in
issue
properly
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
what
i'm
say
--
what
i'm
saying
now
here
is
that
what
we
are
attacking
is
not
the
statute
either
on
its
face
but
certainly
not
on
its
face,
what
we're
attacking
is
the
validity
of
the
conviction
itself.
i
have
had
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
am
here
by
appeal.
i
am
on
--
in
a
supplemental
brief
i
confess
that
you
--
we
are
here
incorrectly
by
appeal.
and
in
the
supplemental
brief
i
have
asked
the
--
pursuant
to
section
20
103
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
that
we
--
that
the
case
to
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
in
fact
was
one
of
the
alternative
prayers
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
that
certiorari
would
be
granted
and
that
the
surviving
issues
apart
from
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
cert
issue
--
the
central
cert
issue
of
course
is
the
validity
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
wouldn't
make
that
prediction
your
honor.
if
i
had
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
have
no
basis
for
being
here
on
appeal
i
think
that
we
have
very
excellent
basis
for
being
here
by
way
of
certiorari
and
if
i
have
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
if
--
yes,
the
appeal,
those
appeal
was
filed
from
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
then
a
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
here.
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
its
conclusion
at
page
13
said
that
the
questions
presented
by
appeals,
substantial,
etcetera,
then
alternatively
in
the
event
that
this
appeal
shall
either
reject
the
appellant,
prays
that
the
papers
herein
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
if
i
have
joined
that
that
docket
--
i
can't
say,
i
would've
made
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
first
place
and
necessarily
we
are
now
here
asking
that
it
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
was
the
most
explicit,
if
i
may
just
look
through
here
a
second.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it's
essentially
a
holt
versus
virginia
issue
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
which
is
a
due
process
first
amendment
and
the
void
of
evidence
issue
as
i
read
that
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
i
hope.
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
certainly
the
central
holt
issue
is
raised
here,
i
mean
by
referring
explicitly
to
holt
in
the
course
of
the
argument
at
the
trial
court
and
by
repeating
those
assertions
in
his
applications
for
writs
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
he
certainly
raised
--
he
certainly
properly
raised
and
preserved
the
holt
issue.
he
raised
it
i
think
in
a
way
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
they
not
only
denied
certiorari
your
honor
but
if
you
--
they
also
have
said
there
is
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
haven't
frankly
examined
that
precise
question
in
terms
of
what
it
means
louisiana
law.
i
would
think
that
its
plain
meaning
is
that
there
is
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
perhaps,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
position
by
louisiana
supreme
court
is
particularly
--
is
directly
relevant
to
whether
we
properly
raised
the
certiorari
issues
here
as
long
as
we
properly
raised
them
in
the
applications
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
for
certiorari,
the
fact
that
they
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
doesn't
denigrate
the
fact
that
we
properly
raised
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
raised
the
holt
--
our
assertion
is
that
we
raised
the
holt
issue
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
i
didn't
look
into
that.
if
the
court
wants
a
supplementary
brief
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but,
in
any
case
i
--
if
it
were
a
disposition
on
the
merits,
obviously
the
case
would
be
strong.
i
don't
think
frankly
it's
any
less
weak
if
it's
a
discretionary
denial
because
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
the
louisiana
supreme
court
decided
it.
the
question
is
whether
it
was
presented
to
them,
entertained
and
rejected
either
just
on
--
by
denial
of
certiorari
or
on
the
merits.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
these
--
the
three
cert
issues
which
are
before
us
all
revolved
around
the
holt
issue
and
they
are
that
the
conviction
violates
the
first
amendment
right
of
courtroom
advocacy
by
an
attorney.
the
whole
holt
versus
virginia
issue
itself
that
denial
of
due
process
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
for
counsel
to
plead
and
the
no
evidence
rule.
and
frankly
all
of
this,
holt
is
the
centerpiece
of
these
three
questions
because
i
think
holt
can
be
looked
upon
as
something
of
a
free
speech
case.
we
looked
upon
as
the
right
of
free
speech
advocacy
in
the
courtroom
as
mr.
justices
douglas
and
black
once
referred
to
in
fisher
v.
pace
in
a
dissenting
opinion
there.
so
it
has
been
treated
or
considered
to
be
a
first
amendment
right.
the
second
issue
is
the
square
holt
versus
virginia
issue
vainly
the
right
of
a
lawyer
on
behalf
of
his
client
to
file
relevant
pleadings
in
order
to
try
to
secure
a
floor
which
is
free
of
bias
so
that
could
be
either
a
motion
to
recuse
as
in
this
case
or
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
as
was
the
case
in
holt.
and
the
last
issue
is
a
no
evidence
issue
along
the
line
of
thompson
v.
louisville
which
in
fact
was
one
of
the
grounds
in
the
holt
case
although
it
didn't
precisely
refer
to
thompson
v.
louisville
in
any
of
its
progeny
but
the
court
here
did
say
in
holt
that
speaking
of
the
convictions
for
contempt,
they
rest
on
nothing
whatever
except
allegations
made
in
motions
for
change
of
venue.
the
--
each
of
those
issues
were
raised
below
and
are
here
properly
having
been
raised
and
preserved
below
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
part
of
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
a
misstatement
which
i
corrected
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
in
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
and
grant
and
deal
on
with
the
merits
precisely
as
it
would've
dealt
with
the
merits
of
the
appeal
if
the
appeal
were
properly
here.
and
i
just
might
say
that
with
respect
to
the
application
for
certiorari
that
this
court
has
--
not
infrequently
considered
issues
of
contempt
on
law
--
visited
on
lawyers
by
the
bench
as
a
very
important
aspect
both
of
its
constitutional
duty
and
as
its
supervisory
duty
over
the
conduct
of
litigation
on
the
lower
federal
courts.
there
have
been
several
dozen
contempt
cases
here
in
one
form
or
another.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
itself
indicates
the
significance
of
these
kinds
of
cases
where
lawyers
are
held
to
contempt
by
the
bench
and
i
think
that
the
issue
quite
apart
from
that
even
if
there
had
never
been
a
case
of
this
sort
here
before
that
quite
apart
form
that
it
is
an
important
question
on
its
own
merits
and
does
implicate
the
independence
of
the
bar
and
raise
serious
questions
about
the
bar
being
free
from
the
imposition
of
arbitrary
sanctions
by
judges
and
members
of
the
bench.
i
would
just
like
to
concentrate
for
a
moment
on
the
--
on
this
case
in
its
relationship
to
holt
versus
virginia.
i
think
that
--
looked
at
in
that
light,
it's
a
very
easy
and
that
it
is
controlled
directly
and
entirely
by
holt
versus
virginia.
in
holt
there
are
two
--
two
lawyers
were
held
in
contempt
for
filing
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
in
that
case
in
which
they
charged
that
the
judge
there
“is
now
in
effect
and
or
in
fact
acting
as
police
officer,
chief
prosecution
witness,
adverse
witness
for
the
defense,
grand
jury,
chief
prosecutor
and
judge.”
and
it
also
charged
that
the
judge
had
intimidate
and
harass
attorney
holt
at
an
earlier
hearing
on
the
contempt
proceeding
and
the
judge
thereupon
hearing
this
motion
read
in
open
court
said,
“i
think
the
plea
is
contemptuous.”
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
held
that
the
language
in
that
motion
violated
the
virginia
contempt
statute
which
authorized
summary
punishment
of
a
person
who
“misbehaves”
in
the
presence
of
a
court
so
as
to
obstruct
justice
or
uses
“vile,
contemptuous
or
insulting
language”
which
is
language
not
unlike
that
contained
in
the
louisiana
contempt
statute.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
except
misfeasance
is
not
included
in
the
statute.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
corruption,
favoritism
and
oppression
is
included
in
article
9,
section
1
of
the
louisiana
constitution.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
sole
basis
for
the
contempt
was
this
paragraph
of
the
motion
to
recuse
which
you
must
note
is
not
the
words
of
the
appellant,
the
lawyer
himself
but
as
merely
an
assertion
by
mr.
spencer
that
his
client,
mr.
hopkins,
had
initiated
a
petition
for
removal
of
judge
dixon
and
that
it
--
and
that
that
petition
was
written
in
terms
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance.
they
are
not
mr.
--
they're
not
the
appellant's
words.
they're
not
the
words
of
the
lawyer.
they're
merely
the
assertion
by
the
lawyer
in
a
pleading
that
this
was
an
activity
in
which
his
client
was
presently
engaged
and
that
therefore
the
judge
would
be
prejudiced
against
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
lawyer
drafted
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
lawyer
drafted
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
lawyer
drafted
the
motion
for
recusation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don't
know
who
drafted
the
petition
to
remove
judge
dixon.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
oh,
that's
right.
yes,
of
course,
i
assume
that
the
lawyer
drafted
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
drafted
and
signed
this
pleading.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
this
isn't
the
characterization
of
the
(voice
overlap)
by
the
lawyer.
this
is
merely,
if
you'll
read
it,
it
merely
asserts
that
his
client,
mr.
hopkins
is
engaging
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
remove
from
office
as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely.
indeed,
in
this
language
except
for
the
use
of
misfeasance
which
made
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
24
hours
and
a
hundred
dollars
which
was
a
statutory
maximum
for
a
first
contempt
offense
by
an
attorney
of
louisiana.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
could
be,
i'd
fair,
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
disbarment
proceedings.
i
suppose
it
could
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
where
the
other
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
what
the
other
side
suggested
too
in
one
of
their
briefs
in
opposition
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
but
i
don't
know
that
any
of
us
can
really
say
that
the
way
we
draw
papers
as
opposed
the
way
some
(inaudible)
draws
papers
is
the
proper
way
to
do
it.
some
lawyers
prefer
to
be
more
precise.
i
think
that
this
is
more
precise
than
merely
referring
to
the
statutory
language.
i
might
have
preferred
to
statutory
language,
i
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it's
certainly
more
distinct
which
may
be
a
consideration
when
you're
trying
to
show
to
a
judge
that
he
may
be
biased
against
your
client.
you
want
to
make
this,
i
would
think,
i
have
--
myself
have
never
filed
such
a
motion
so
i
can't
claim
any
great
experience
in
the
area
but
i
would
think
that
if
i
were
to
file
such
motion
that
i
would
want
to
make
as
explicit
and
as
possible
what
i
believe
the
basis
for
the
possible
bias
might
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
implication
is
that
he
was.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
may
have
been
more
prudent,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would've
more
lawyerlike,
i
don't
know
if
those
two
terms
are
interchangeable.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
can't
say,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
judge
dixon
temperament.
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
judge
dixon.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
depend
on
that
also
but
i
think
primarily
it
would
depend
on
the
temperament
of
judge
dixon.
as
contempt
proceedings,
i
think,
it
ought
always
depend
on
the
temperament
of
the
judge
who
issues
the
contempt
and
i
think
its
precisely
the
over
sensitive
judge
who
is
the
danger
to
the
independent
court
but
i
think
it's
this
court's
duty
to
interpose
itself
between
such
insensitivity
and
the
right
of
a
lawyer
aggressively
to
represent
the
interest
of
his
client
and
i
think
that's
what
the
appellant
is
doing
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
nothing
whatsoever
one
way
or
the
other?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
record.
however,
mr.
spencer
did
assert
over
and
over
again
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
file
any
evidence
--
to
produce
any
evidence
of
that
petition
having
been
filed.
and
as
i
read
on
my
principal
presentation,
judge
williams
himself
in
his
opposition
to
the
appellant's
application
for
writs
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
and
you'll
find
this
at
page
21
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he
says,
this
is
judge
williams
who
was
on
the
hearing,
he
said,
“applicant
in
his
petition,
page
5,
paragraph
(e),
section
5,
assigns
this
error,
the
trial
court
not
allowing
a
defense
of
truth
to
the
contempt
charge.”
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i'm
on
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
page
21
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
reproduces
beginning
at
page
16,
judge
williams'
response
to
the
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
that
at
page
21,
i
just
read
the
first
sentence,
the
second
sentence
says,
judge
william,
and
this
is
judge
william
himself
speaking
in
the
third
person.
judge
william
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
cite
a
case,
getro
v.
getro
(ph)
in
louisiana
supreme
court
which
held
in
1952,
the
justification
is
not
a
defense
for
contempt
of
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
though
this
statement
refers
to
the
appe
--
to
mr.
spencer's
efforts
to
establish
that
such
a
petition
was
actually
being
circulated.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
why
i
read
it.
the
science
is
error.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
all
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all
though
the
witness
says
he
tried
to
bring
back
at
that
time
had
no
relevancy
at
all
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
such
a
petition.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
all
i
can
say
as
i
was
told
that
such
a
petition
was
circulated
was
drawn
up
and
circulated.
it
may
not
have
been
filed.
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
secure
the
necessary
25
signatures.
but
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
assertion
in
the
motion
to
recuse.
it
isn't
that
it
was
filed.
it
was
said
that
they're
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
removed,
the
implication
being
that
they
were
trying
to
get
the
necessary
25
signatures.
but
i'm
told
that
such
a
petition
was
typed
up
and
was
in
existence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
surely
do
unless
what
judge
williams
says
is
accurate
that
he
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
i
perfectly
--
i
agree
100%
that
there
has
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
which
shows
whether
or
not
such
a
petition
exists.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
contempt
--
conviction
of
an
attorney
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
there
--
jurisdiction
was
postponed
pending
argument
on
the
merits
and
there
are
some
jurisdictional
problems.
before
discussing
those,
i
would
like
to
describe
the
facts
of
the
conviction
itself
because
of
the
facts
of
the
conviction
also
involved
some
of
the
jurisdictional
problems.
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
spencer
is
an
attorney,
member
of
the
louisiana
bar
who
appeared
before
a
judge
dixon,
a
district
court
judge
in
the
louisiana
courts
representing
one,
mr.
hopkins
in
a
hearing
in
a
divorce
case.
it
was
an
uncontested
divorce
suit
and
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
was,
according
to
louisiana
practice,
to
confirm
default
in
mr.
hopkins
favor.
after
testimony
was
taken
by
--
was
given
by
mr.
hopkins
and
witness
on
his
behalf,
judge
dixon
denied
the
divorce
because
the
testimony
didn't
show
abandonment
by
the
spouse
but
showed
only
that
mr.
hopkins
and
mrs.
hopkins
have
had
argument
and
that
they
decided
that
one
of
them
should
leave
and
mrs.
hopkins
was
the
one
to
leave.
the
following
day
after
the
denial
of
the
divorce,
the
appellant
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
behalf
of
his
client
mr.
hopkins
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
by
judge
dixon
was
erroneous
in
fact
and
in
law.
simultaneously
with
filing
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
he
also
filed
a
motion
to
recuse
judge
dixon.
the
motion
to
recuse
which
he
filed
was
set
out
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
record
doesn't
show,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
oh,
i
don't
know
what
one
--
i
believe
that
one
cannot
draw
inferences
from
the
record
because
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
at
all
to
suggest
when
this
impeachment
proceeding
was
initiated,
if
it
was
initiated
and
was
initiated
and
what
the
--
what
any
of
the
facts
surrounding
that
proceeding
were.
what
if
any
of
the
facts
are
on
that
petition
were
but
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know
it's
true
or
false,
your
honor.
one
of
the
reasons
we
don't
know
whether
it's
true
or
false
is
that
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
contempt
proceeding
itself
the
year
later
wouldn't
allow
any
such
testimony
to
be
entered.
now
the
record
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
any
such
testimony
was
attempted
to
be
put
in
by
the
appellant
but
it
becomes
perfectly
clear
from
the
statement
of
judge
williams
himself
that
he
was
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
contempt
hearing
that
--
and
this
is
contained
in
the
record
of
the
case
and
also
in
the
back
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he,
judge
williams
in
opposing
mr.
spencer's
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
to
louisiana
supreme
court
said
in
and
i
quote,
well,
i'm
sorry
i
don't
quote,
but
in
his
application
with
--
in
his
opposition
to
the
application
which
is
in
the
record,
judge
williams
said
himself
that
he
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence
concerning
the
truth
of
the
assertion
in
the
motion
to
recuse.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
know,
i
don't
--
i
think
mr.
hopkins
was
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no
sir,
less
in
about
him
than
about
that
of
mr.
hopkins.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
do
know
that
there
was
then
a
procedure
under
the
louisiana
constitution,
article
9
of
the
constitution
which
provided
that
upon
the
petition
of
any
25
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
they
alleged
that
a
judge
was
guilty
of
one
of
a
fairly
long
list
of
offenses
ranging
from
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
to
habitual
drunkenness
and
including
incompetency,
corruption,
favoritism,
extortion,
oppression
in
office,
and
gross
misconduct
that
upon
a
filing
of
a
petition
with
the
district
attorney
by
25
citizens
so
alleging
that
the
district
attorney
had
to
initiate
impeachment
proceedings.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
your
honor.
however
that
statute
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
--
this
motion
to
recuse
was
filed
was
repealed
not
long
afterwards.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
was
elevated
to
the
--
to
an
appellate
court
in
louisiana
not
long
after
this
trial
also,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir,
i
am
and
if
i
may
just
finish
the
recital
of
facts
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
motion
to
recuse
contained
the
following
paragraphs.
paragraph
4
and
it's
set
out
at
page
8
of
the
appendix,
the
separate
appendix.
it
says,
“the
plaintiff
herein,
louis
b.
hopkins,
jr.
and
his
chief
witness
in
this
case,
mr.
charles
anderson,
iii
are
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
removed
from
office
as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance
in
office.”
and
the
next
paragraph
said
that
because
of
the
--
this
activity
by
mr.
hopkins
that
the
judge
is
therefore
interested
in
the
cause
and
bias,
prejudice
and
harbors
personal
animosity
towards
the
plaintiff.
in
the
motion
to
recuse
was
filed
pursuant
to
a
louisiana
statute
which
permits
motions
to
recuse
on
allegations
that
filed.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
nexus
is
that
judge
inferentially
knowing
about
the
motion
to
impeach
about
the
proceeding
to
impeach
initiated
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
would
necessarily
be
biased
against
him
on
the
fair
assumption
that
it
certainly
isn't
something
that
we're
going
endear
the
plaintiff
to
the
judge.
that
--
and
that
was
the
essence
of
the
claim
of
bias
and
personal
animosity,
a
fair
implication,
i
would
think.
this
motion
to
recuse
having
been
filed
the
judge
several
days
later
issued
an
order
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
why
appellant,
mr.
spencer
what
not
be
held
in
contempt.
and
the
order
is
set
out
in
page
10
of
the
appendix,
it's
very
brief
and
it
says
using
the
language
of
the
louisiana
contempt
statute
that
he
did
file
a
pleading
which
contains
scandalous,
insulting
and
abusive
language
and
a
relevant
criticism
of
the
judge
of
said
court,
which
pleading
is
attached
hereto
and
made
a
part
hereof
in
which
language
particularly
in
paragraph
4
which
is
the
paragraph
i
read
relating
to
the
impeachment
proceedings
thereof,
impairs
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
the
respect
for
his
authority
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
at
that
point
the
appellant
here
initiated
collateral
proceedings,
united
states
district
court
of
louisiana
to
enjoin
the
contempt
proceedings.
i
don't
think
that's
directly
relevant
now.
that
was
an
attack
on
the
sta
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
collateral
actions,
your
honor?
that
was
an
1983
civil
rights
action
based
partially
on
dombrowski
v.
pfister
to
enjoin
the
contempt
proceeding
against
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
afraid
i
can't
recall,
the
free
speech,
yes,
precisely.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
alleged
a
free
--
he
alleged
that
the
statute
--
louisiana
contempt
statute
violated
the
first
amendment
on
its
face.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
decided
against
appellant,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
on
a
summary
judgment,
yes.
there
was
a
--
there
was
initially
a
three-judge
court
and
then
they
--
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
filed
those
on
appeal
and
then
withdrew
it
afterwards,
yes.
another
part
of
that
proceeding
was
that
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
out
of
that
proceeding,
that
judge
dixon
disqualified
himself
from
sitting
on
the
contempt
hearing
itself
and
another
judge
was
assigned
to
actually
hear
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
only
issue
that
was
disposed
of
in
the
federal
court
action
was
the
constitutionality
of
the
contempt
statute
on
its
face
although
that
was
raised
here
initially
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
from
our
supplemental
brief
you'll
see
that
we're
confessing
that
that
ought
not
be
here
because
it
was
not
properly
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
other
issues
by
which
you
mean
the
whole
three
of
the
general
issues,
the
three
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
were
raised
--
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
was
raised
in
the
motion
to
recuse
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
judge
williams
and
in
the
appellant's
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
but
it
was
raised
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
is
on
the
record.
that
was
most
explicitly
raised
in
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
before
judge
williams
at
page
--
well,
its
raised
in
a
couple
of
places.
at
page
18
(voice
overlap)
in
the
appendix
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
first
words
are
holt
versus
virginia,
that's
mr.
spencer
engaging
in
colloquy
with
judge
williams.
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
what
he
--
quote
some
of
the
language
from
the
holt
case
and
then
at
the
conclusion,
it
says
under
these
circumstances,
the
decision
decided
by
8
judges,
the
one
that
said,
the
supreme
court,
meaning
this
court
found
that
these
constitutionally
protected,
expressions
of
free
speech
that
i
would
submit
that
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
the
other
issue
that
he
persistently
raised
was
the
issue
of
his
right
to
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
the
reference
to
holt,
yes,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
addressed
its
--
it
addressed
itself
to
the
charge
against
--
it
addressed
himself
to
the
charge
against
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
are
and
i
have
in
our
supplemental
brief
conceded
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
conceded
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
have
--
we
have
abandoned
the
attack
on
the
contempt
statute
on
its
face
because
in
my
opinion
it
was
impossible
to
assert
that
there
--
that
it
had
been
joined
in
issue
properly
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
what
i'm
say
--
what
i'm
saying
now
here
is
that
what
we
are
attacking
is
not
the
statute
either
on
its
face
but
certainly
not
on
its
face,
what
we're
attacking
is
the
validity
of
the
conviction
itself.
i
have
had
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
am
here
by
appeal.
i
am
on
--
in
a
supplemental
brief
i
confess
that
you
--
we
are
here
incorrectly
by
appeal.
and
in
the
supplemental
brief
i
have
asked
the
--
pursuant
to
section
20
103
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
that
we
--
that
the
case
to
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
in
fact
was
one
of
the
alternative
prayers
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
that
certiorari
would
be
granted
and
that
the
surviving
issues
apart
from
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
cert
issue
--
the
central
cert
issue
of
course
is
the
validity
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
wouldn't
make
that
prediction
your
honor.
if
i
had
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
have
no
basis
for
being
here
on
appeal
i
think
that
we
have
very
excellent
basis
for
being
here
by
way
of
certiorari
and
if
i
have
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
if
--
yes,
the
appeal,
those
appeal
was
filed
from
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
then
a
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
here.
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
its
conclusion
at
page
13
said
that
the
questions
presented
by
appeals,
substantial,
etcetera,
then
alternatively
in
the
event
that
this
appeal
shall
either
reject
the
appellant,
prays
that
the
papers
herein
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
if
i
have
joined
that
that
docket
--
i
can't
say,
i
would've
made
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
first
place
and
necessarily
we
are
now
here
asking
that
it
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
was
the
most
explicit,
if
i
may
just
look
through
here
a
second.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it's
essentially
a
holt
versus
virginia
issue
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
which
is
a
due
process
first
amendment
and
the
void
of
evidence
issue
as
i
read
that
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
i
hope.
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
certainly
the
central
holt
issue
is
raised
here,
i
mean
by
referring
explicitly
to
holt
in
the
course
of
the
argument
at
the
trial
court
and
by
repeating
those
assertions
in
his
applications
for
writs
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
he
certainly
raised
--
he
certainly
properly
raised
and
preserved
the
holt
issue.
he
raised
it
i
think
in
a
way
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
they
not
only
denied
certiorari
your
honor
but
if
you
--
they
also
have
said
there
is
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
haven't
frankly
examined
that
precise
question
in
terms
of
what
it
means
louisiana
law.
i
would
think
that
its
plain
meaning
is
that
there
is
no
error
of
law
in
the
ruling
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
perhaps,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
position
by
louisiana
supreme
court
is
particularly
--
is
directly
relevant
to
whether
we
properly
raised
the
certiorari
issues
here
as
long
as
we
properly
raised
them
in
the
applications
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
for
certiorari,
the
fact
that
they
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
doesn't
denigrate
the
fact
that
we
properly
raised
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
we
raised
the
holt
--
our
assertion
is
that
we
raised
the
holt
issue
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
i
didn't
look
into
that.
if
the
court
wants
a
supplementary
brief
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but,
in
any
case
i
--
if
it
were
a
disposition
on
the
merits,
obviously
the
case
would
be
strong.
i
don't
think
frankly
it's
any
less
weak
if
it's
a
discretionary
denial
because
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
the
louisiana
supreme
court
decided
it.
the
question
is
whether
it
was
presented
to
them,
entertained
and
rejected
either
just
on
--
by
denial
of
certiorari
or
on
the
merits.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
these
--
the
three
cert
issues
which
are
before
us
all
revolved
around
the
holt
issue
and
they
are
that
the
conviction
violates
the
first
amendment
right
of
courtroom
advocacy
by
an
attorney.
the
whole
holt
versus
virginia
issue
itself
that
denial
of
due
process
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
for
counsel
to
plead
and
the
no
evidence
rule.
and
frankly
all
of
this,
holt
is
the
centerpiece
of
these
three
questions
because
i
think
holt
can
be
looked
upon
as
something
of
a
free
speech
case.
we
looked
upon
as
the
right
of
free
speech
advocacy
in
the
courtroom
as
mr.
justices
douglas
and
black
once
referred
to
in
fisher
v.
pace
in
a
dissenting
opinion
there.
so
it
has
been
treated
or
considered
to
be
a
first
amendment
right.
the
second
issue
is
the
square
holt
versus
virginia
issue
vainly
the
right
of
a
lawyer
on
behalf
of
his
client
to
file
relevant
pleadings
in
order
to
try
to
secure
a
floor
which
is
free
of
bias
so
that
could
be
either
a
motion
to
recuse
as
in
this
case
or
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
as
was
the
case
in
holt.
and
the
last
issue
is
a
no
evidence
issue
along
the
line
of
thompson
v.
louisville
which
in
fact
was
one
of
the
grounds
in
the
holt
case
although
it
didn't
precisely
refer
to
thompson
v.
louisville
in
any
of
its
progeny
but
the
court
here
did
say
in
holt
that
speaking
of
the
convictions
for
contempt,
they
rest
on
nothing
whatever
except
allegations
made
in
motions
for
change
of
venue.
the
--
each
of
those
issues
were
raised
below
and
are
here
properly
having
been
raised
and
preserved
below
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
part
of
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
a
misstatement
which
i
corrected
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
in
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
and
grant
and
deal
on
with
the
merits
precisely
as
it
would've
dealt
with
the
merits
of
the
appeal
if
the
appeal
were
properly
here.
and
i
just
might
say
that
with
respect
to
the
application
for
certiorari
that
this
court
has
--
not
infrequently
considered
issues
of
contempt
on
law
--
visited
on
lawyers
by
the
bench
as
a
very
important
aspect
both
of
its
constitutional
duty
and
as
its
supervisory
duty
over
the
conduct
of
litigation
on
the
lower
federal
courts.
there
have
been
several
dozen
contempt
cases
here
in
one
form
or
another.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
itself
indicates
the
significance
of
these
kinds
of
cases
where
lawyers
are
held
to
contempt
by
the
bench
and
i
think
that
the
issue
quite
apart
from
that
even
if
there
had
never
been
a
case
of
this
sort
here
before
that
quite
apart
form
that
it
is
an
important
question
on
its
own
merits
and
does
implicate
the
independence
of
the
bar
and
raise
serious
questions
about
the
bar
being
free
from
the
imposition
of
arbitrary
sanctions
by
judges
and
members
of
the
bench.
i
would
just
like
to
concentrate
for
a
moment
on
the
--
on
this
case
in
its
relationship
to
holt
versus
virginia.
i
think
that
--
looked
at
in
that
light,
it's
a
very
easy
and
that
it
is
controlled
directly
and
entirely
by
holt
versus
virginia.
in
holt
there
are
two
--
two
lawyers
were
held
in
contempt
for
filing
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
in
that
case
in
which
they
charged
that
the
judge
there
“is
now
in
effect
and
or
in
fact
acting
as
police
officer,
chief
prosecution
witness,
adverse
witness
for
the
defense,
grand
jury,
chief
prosecutor
and
judge.”
and
it
also
charged
that
the
judge
had
intimidate
and
harass
attorney
holt
at
an
earlier
hearing
on
the
contempt
proceeding
and
the
judge
thereupon
hearing
this
motion
read
in
open
court
said,
“i
think
the
plea
is
contemptuous.”
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
held
that
the
language
in
that
motion
violated
the
virginia
contempt
statute
which
authorized
summary
punishment
of
a
person
who
“misbehaves”
in
the
presence
of
a
court
so
as
to
obstruct
justice
or
uses
“vile,
contemptuous
or
insulting
language”
which
is
language
not
unlike
that
contained
in
the
louisiana
contempt
statute.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
except
misfeasance
is
not
included
in
the
statute.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
corruption,
favoritism
and
oppression
is
included
in
article
9,
section
1
of
the
louisiana
constitution.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
sole
basis
for
the
contempt
was
this
paragraph
of
the
motion
to
recuse
which
you
must
note
is
not
the
words
of
the
appellant,
the
lawyer
himself
but
as
merely
an
assertion
by
mr.
spencer
that
his
client,
mr.
hopkins,
had
initiated
a
petition
for
removal
of
judge
dixon
and
that
it
--
and
that
that
petition
was
written
in
terms
of
corruption,
favoritism,
oppression
and
misfeasance.
they
are
not
mr.
--
they're
not
the
appellant's
words.
they're
not
the
words
of
the
lawyer.
they're
merely
the
assertion
by
the
lawyer
in
a
pleading
that
this
was
an
activity
in
which
his
client
was
presently
engaged
and
that
therefore
the
judge
would
be
prejudiced
against
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
lawyer
drafted
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
lawyer
drafted
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
lawyer
drafted
the
motion
for
recusation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don't
know
who
drafted
the
petition
to
remove
judge
dixon.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
oh,
that's
right.
yes,
of
course,
i
assume
that
the
lawyer
drafted
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
drafted
and
signed
this
pleading.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
this
isn't
the
characterization
of
the
(voice
overlap)
by
the
lawyer.
this
is
merely,
if
you'll
read
it,
it
merely
asserts
that
his
client,
mr.
hopkins
is
engaging
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
remove
from
office
as
being
unfit
therefore
by
virtue
of
corruption
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely.
indeed,
in
this
language
except
for
the
use
of
misfeasance
which
made
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
24
hours
and
a
hundred
dollars
which
was
a
statutory
maximum
for
a
first
contempt
offense
by
an
attorney
of
louisiana.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
could
be,
i'd
fair,
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
disbarment
proceedings.
i
suppose
it
could
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
where
the
other
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
what
the
other
side
suggested
too
in
one
of
their
briefs
in
opposition
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
but
i
don't
know
that
any
of
us
can
really
say
that
the
way
we
draw
papers
as
opposed
the
way
some
(inaudible)
draws
papers
is
the
proper
way
to
do
it.
some
lawyers
prefer
to
be
more
precise.
i
think
that
this
is
more
precise
than
merely
referring
to
the
statutory
language.
i
might
have
preferred
to
statutory
language,
i
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it's
certainly
more
distinct
which
may
be
a
consideration
when
you're
trying
to
show
to
a
judge
that
he
may
be
biased
against
your
client.
you
want
to
make
this,
i
would
think,
i
have
--
myself
have
never
filed
such
a
motion
so
i
can't
claim
any
great
experience
in
the
area
but
i
would
think
that
if
i
were
to
file
such
motion
that
i
would
want
to
make
as
explicit
and
as
possible
what
i
believe
the
basis
for
the
possible
bias
might
be.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
implication
is
that
he
was.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
may
have
been
more
prudent,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would've
more
lawyerlike,
i
don't
know
if
those
two
terms
are
interchangeable.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
really
can't
say,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
judge
dixon
temperament.
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
judge
dixon.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
depend
on
that
also
but
i
think
primarily
it
would
depend
on
the
temperament
of
judge
dixon.
as
contempt
proceedings,
i
think,
it
ought
always
depend
on
the
temperament
of
the
judge
who
issues
the
contempt
and
i
think
its
precisely
the
over
sensitive
judge
who
is
the
danger
to
the
independent
court
but
i
think
it's
this
court's
duty
to
interpose
itself
between
such
insensitivity
and
the
right
of
a
lawyer
aggressively
to
represent
the
interest
of
his
client
and
i
think
that's
what
the
appellant
is
doing
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
nothing
whatsoever
one
way
or
the
other?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
the
record.
however,
mr.
spencer
did
assert
over
and
over
again
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
file
any
evidence
--
to
produce
any
evidence
of
that
petition
having
been
filed.
and
as
i
read
on
my
principal
presentation,
judge
williams
himself
in
his
opposition
to
the
appellant's
application
for
writs
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
and
you'll
find
this
at
page
21
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
he
says,
this
is
judge
williams
who
was
on
the
hearing,
he
said,
“applicant
in
his
petition,
page
5,
paragraph
(e),
section
5,
assigns
this
error,
the
trial
court
not
allowing
a
defense
of
truth
to
the
contempt
charge.”
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i'm
on
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
page
21
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
reproduces
beginning
at
page
16,
judge
williams'
response
to
the
application
for
writs
of
certiorari
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
that
at
page
21,
i
just
read
the
first
sentence,
the
second
sentence
says,
judge
william,
and
this
is
judge
william
himself
speaking
in
the
third
person.
judge
william
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
cite
a
case,
getro
v.
getro
(ph)
in
louisiana
supreme
court
which
held
in
1952,
the
justification
is
not
a
defense
for
contempt
of
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
though
this
statement
refers
to
the
appe
--
to
mr.
spencer's
efforts
to
establish
that
such
a
petition
was
actually
being
circulated.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that's
why
i
read
it.
the
science
is
error.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
all
of
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all
though
the
witness
says
he
tried
to
bring
back
at
that
time
had
no
relevancy
at
all
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
such
a
petition.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
all
i
can
say
as
i
was
told
that
such
a
petition
was
circulated
was
drawn
up
and
circulated.
it
may
not
have
been
filed.
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
secure
the
necessary
25
signatures.
but
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
assertion
in
the
motion
to
recuse.
it
isn't
that
it
was
filed.
it
was
said
that
they're
presently
engaged
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
have
judge
dixon
removed,
the
implication
being
that
they
were
trying
to
get
the
necessary
25
signatures.
but
i'm
told
that
such
a
petition
was
typed
up
and
was
in
existence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
surely
do
unless
what
judge
williams
says
is
accurate
that
he
refused
to
admit
any
such
evidence.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
i
perfectly
--
i
agree
100%
that
there
has
nothing
in
the
record
one
way
or
the
other
which
shows
whether
or
not
such
a
petition
exists.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you,
sir.
