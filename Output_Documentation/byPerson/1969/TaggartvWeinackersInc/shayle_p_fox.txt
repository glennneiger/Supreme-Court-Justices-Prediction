mr.
shayle
p.
fox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
petitioner's
argument,
i
would
like
to
briefly
go
into
few
of
the
salient
facts
which
have
not
been
emphasized
to
discuss
further
from
these
facts.
they
indicate
that
the
character
and
nature
of
this
property
is
private
and
not
public.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
store
sells
groceries
and
drugs.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
there
were
small
hardware
department
as
well,
but
it
was
in
a
traditional
style
of
today's
supermarket,
including
groceries
and
drugs.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
don't
know
the
square
feet
involved.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
store
building
as
an
appendix
to
respondent's
brief.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
it
was
a
good
sized
grocery
store,
very
large
sized
supermarket
grocery
store.
going
on
from
the
argument
that
this
property
was
private
rather
than
public
under
any
concept
of
this
court,
it
is
our
contention
that
even
if
the
property
were
to
be
held
quasi
public
under
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
state
of
alabama
did
no
more
than
reasonably
regulate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioners.
and
finally
that
in
doing
so,
the
alabama
court
exercised
its
proper
jurisdiction
in
accordance
with
its
traditional
rights
to
remedy
a
wrong
against
property
and
persons
within
its
jurisdiction
and
subject
to
its
protection.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
that
we
discussed
a
moment
ago,
the
building
is
set
back
from
the
street.
this
is
a
supermarket
with
a
parking
lot,
it
is
large.
the
parking
lot
is
large
as
well.
however,
the
major
portion
of
the
parking
lot
is
not
between
this
public
street
and
the
store.
the
parking
lot
surrounds
the
store.
at
the
front
of
the
store,
there
is
room
for
two
rows
of
parking.
one
facing
the
store,
one
facing
the
street
and
an
isle
between
them
for
cars
to
maneuver
within
the
parking
lot,
directly
adjacent
to
this
parking
lot
is
a
broad
public
sidewalk
running
the
full
length
of
the
street,
the
public
street
upon
which
the
store
faces.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
the
plat
on
40,
if
you
would
like
a
diagram
of
the
property.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
a40.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
a40
shows
the
store
and
diagrams
the
distances
between
the
store
and
the
public
street.
i
think
the
best
picture
of
the
premises
is
probably
a7
which
is
a
photograph
indicating
exactly
what
i'm
discussing
now,
the
two
rows
of
parking
and
the
public
street.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
as
far
as
i'm
able
to
ascertain
from
the
opinions
of
the
court
and
the
record,
it
took
place
on
the
sidewalk
--
the
public
sidewalk
first
then
at
various
places
in
the
parking
lot
as
well
as
the
sidewalk
directly
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
to
the
store
building.
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
affirming
the
lower
court,
they
found
that
the
pickets
were
in
the
way
of
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
store,
so
presumably
they
must
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
right
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
front
door.
they
did
not
come
in
to
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
they
did
not
come
in
to
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
that
i'd
have
difficulty
either
quarreling
with
it
or
accepting
it
in
this
court.
it
was
based
upon
affidavits
and
support
of
a
petition
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that
said
obstructing
(voice
overlap)
that
was
the
word.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
could
mean
that
their
presence
was
in
the
way
of
those
--
their
physical
presence
was
in
the
way
of
those
coming
in
and
out
of
the
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
suppose
they
could
have.
it
would
be
a
fair
construction
that
anywhere
on
the
lot
they
may
have
been
obstructing
the
conduct
of
respondent's
business.
however,
i
don't
think
the
burden
is
on
me
to
substantiate
that
finding
in
this
court
when
two
occasions
in
the
lower
courts,
petitioners
failed
to
avail
themselves
in
statutory
provisions
for
supplying
counter
affidavits.
they
could've
had
their
hearing
if
they
wanted
it
then,
they
just
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
do
not
think
there
is,
unless
the
court
wants
it.
i
think
that
is
a
discretionary
matter,
but
i
do
know
that
under
two
sections
of
the
alabama
code,
they
could
have
filed
counter
affidavits
and
did
not
do
so.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
had
a
hearing.
they
had
a
hearing
based
upon
the
record
in
front
of
the
court
at
that
time
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
affidavits
of
the
respondent
only.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
a
hearing.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it's
sufficient
for
permanent
injunction
under
alabama
law.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
it
hasn't
been
challenged
in
this
court
as
a
failure
to
grant
petitioners
due
process
of
law
under
the
united
states
constitution.
that
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
court.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
two
separate
provisions
of
the
alabama
code
give
them
that
right.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
judge
accepted
the
evidence
before
him,
which
were
the
affidavits
of
respondent
alone.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
record
does
not
indicate.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
is
not
so
indicated
in
the
record.
it
appears
from
the
record
that
the
only
argument
raised
by
petitioners
in
the
lower
court
was
not
a
factual
argument.
they
quarreled
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
was
their
sole
contention
before
the
court
below.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
i
claim
it
on
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
claim
it
that
the
court
in
precluding
the
pickets
from
coming
on
to
this
limited
property
were
within
their
jurisdiction
and
acted
properly
and
that
they
had
the
right
to
move
the
pickets,
in
effect,
100
feet
away
by
moving
them
on
to
a
public
sidewalk,
a
safe
and
proximate
place
to
stand
only
100
feet
from
the
front
door
of
the
respondent's
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
court
did
not
enjoin
picketing
per
se.
the
court
said
“there
will
be
no
picketing
allowed
on
the
premises
of
the
respondent
only”.
what
the
effect
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
the
only
injunction.
the
pickets
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
not
at
all.
the
pickets
have
every
right
today
to
go
out
to
the
public
sidewalk
100
feet
from
the
front
door
of
the
respondent's
property
and
picket.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
anywhere
in
the
parking
lot
at
all.
anywhere
within
the
lot
lines
of
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
within
that
parking
lot
and
on
the
petitioner's
walk
directly
in
front
of
the
front
door
of
its
premises.
the
picketing
took
place
right
at
the
store.
the
public
sidewalk
open
to
the
pickets
now
is
100
feet
away
from
the
front
door.
they
are
moved
100
feet
by
this
injunction
that
is
presently
pending.
now,
our
contention
is
that
this
is
private
property
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
unlike
petitioner's
claim,
we
do
not
believe
that
openness
to
the
public
is
the
only
viable
standard.
that
principle
brings
us
smack
into
a
dichotomy
with
their
position
on
no
claim
to
coming
into
the
store
itself.
the
same
standard
being
applied
in
the
two
circumstances,
the
store
and
the
parking
lot
would
allow
the
pickets
into
the
store.
this
was
not
a
reasonable
standard
and
this
is
not
in
our
opinion,
what
the
court
meant
in
its
decision
in
logan
valley,
calling
private
property
quasi
public
or
available
for
public
use
or
open
to
the
public.
in
that
case,
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
marge
versus
alabama,
it
wasn't
the
openness
to
the
public
which
was
the
sole
standard.
it
was
the
use
by
the
public
in
a
particular
way.
the
public
used
the
property
in
these
previous
cases
as
a
sidewalk,
as
a
part,
as
a
thorough
fair
to
go
from
one
place
to
another,
or
as
the
court
said
in
logan
valley,
“freely
open
to
the
public
in
the
area
and
those
passing
through.”
the
parking
lot
in
this
store
is
not
freely
open
to
the
public
and
those
passing
through.
nobody
passes
through
this
parking
that
is
not
going
into
the
weinacker's
store
building.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
oh,
yes.
oh!
there
is
no
statement
in
the
record
that
the
general
public
does
not
use
this
property.
the
only
statement
in
the
record
is
that
it
is
private
property,
and
as
private
property,
without
an
indication
that
it
is
used
as
a
public
thorough
fair,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
public
thorough
fair
directly
adjacent
to
it,
a
public
sidewalk
directly
adjacent
to
it
would
indicate
that
there's
no
need
for
this
private
property
to
be
used
as
public
property.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
would
not.
they
would
be
allowed
to
walk
into
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
because
any
store
then
is
public.
any
store
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
what
is
the
difference?
i
see
no
difference
between
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
is
when
they
conduct
their
selves
in
of
manner
that
is
inimical
to
the
conduct
to
the
business
on
the
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
carrying
a
picket
sign,
throwing
a
bomb.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
anything
they
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
no
but
anything
they
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
correct.
the
picket
sign
because
of
its
effect
of
being
inimical
to
the
conduct
to
the
business.
and
we
submit
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
as
much
protection
of
his
conduct
of
a
business
as
the
picket
sign
to
come
on
and
utilize
their
most
effective
economic
weapon
against
the
respondent.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that
would've
tended
to
indicate
that
the
property
was
less
open
to
the
public.
it
wouldn't
be
a
usual
manner
of
conducting
a
retail
business.
we
do
concede
this
is
a
retail
business
open
generally
to
the
public
to
come
on
to
the
property
and
shop.
we
wanted
the
public
in
our
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
general
public.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
because
there
the
general
public
is
conducting
themselves
detrimental
to
our
conduct
of
our
business.
they
are
interfering
with
our
right
to
conduct
the
business.
they
are
not
there
to
buy.
assuming
that
we
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
there
was
no
part
of
it
being
used
by
the
general
public
other
than
the
instance
of
the
pickets
or
the
people
who
came
to
buy
in
the
store.
this
was
not
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
people
walked
across
this
property
to
go
from
one
place
to
another.
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
came
on
to
this
property
to
park
their
car
while
they
went
to
visit
friends
in
the
neighborhood.
this
was
just
a
grocery
store
and
the
only
instance
in
the
record
of
people
using
it
other
than
the
shop
is
the
use
by
the
pickets
here.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
they
varied
from
time
to
time.
i
don't
really
know
what
the
maximum
number
was.
i
don't
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
the
contention
here
or
that
is
an
issue.
we
believe
that
we
have
the
right
to
exclude
every
single
one
of
them
for
two
reasons.
one,
that
this
is
private
property
and
the
private
property
owner
has
the
right
to
seek
remedy
from
the
presence
of
a
person
who
is
disrupting
its
business
in
any
way.
and
two
that
even
if
under
the
standards
of
this
court,
this
property
because
it
is
a
retail
business,
parking
lot,
is
held
to
be
quasi
public.
it's
still
reserved
to
the
lower
court
the
right
to
reasonably
regulate
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
moving
the
pickets
100
feet
where
they
are
still
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
front
door
is
a
reasonable
regulation.
now,
how
do
we
differ
this
from
--
or
distinguish
this
from
logan
valley?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
you
could
find
this
as
private
property.
if
this
is
private
property,
they
could
be
excluded,
that's
traditional.
a
man
who
owns
property
can
exclude
anybody
whose
interests
are
opposed
to
himself.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
agree.
that
is
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
the
secondary
contention.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
you
can
agree
with
me
on
my
prior
contention
and
come
to
the
same
result
whether
or
not
the
regulation
is
reasonable,
because
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
right
because
the
general
public
does
not
have
free
speech
rights
on
private
property.
there's
no
free
speech
right.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
handicap
is
right,
i
agree
with
that,
but
they
could
regulate
the
place
at
which
free
speech
is
to
be
conducted.
the
place,
the
location
of
the
free
--
as
one
as
it
may
have
been
--
one
of
the
justices
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
and
i
am
saying
that
an
injunction
which
merely
moves
people
100
feet
with
nothing
intervening
along
that
100-foot
distance
to
block
the
reading
of
a
picket
sign,
or
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
voice
coming
from
a
hundred
feet
away,
does
not
unreasonably
interfere
with
the
communication
of
ideas.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
the
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
don't
say
handicap,
but
i
see
no
handicap
for
the
exact
channel
of
communication
that's
being
requested
by
the
pickets
is
still
open
to
them
and
all
they
are
being
told
is
to
move
a
hundred
feet.
that
is
not
a
handicap
to
communication.
petitioners
are
alleging
that
makes
their
communication
less
effective.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
it
would
be
a
handicap
that
this
court
i'm
sure
would
find
so
serious
that
they
would
be
willing
to
then
handicap
free
speech
and
preserve
the
rights
in
the
home.
the
idea
when
we
have
a
conflicting
constitutional
right
being
claimed
by
two
parties
is
that
this
court
and
other
courts
have
looked
to
the
detriment
to
one
by
upholding
the
other.
in
the
case
of
a
home,
somebody
coming
into
a
home,
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
the
damage
to
the
privacy
of
the
home,
a
right
guaranteed
to
the
home
owner
would
be
so
severe
that
the
handicap
to
free
speech
would
be
ordered.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
would
be
required
to
stand
out
public
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
home
or
the
nearest
area
traditionally
available
for
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
may
not
be
free
to
do
it
at
all.
this
court
has
upheld
regulation
of
the
use
of
soundtracks,
even
city
streets.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
and
it
maybe
only
permitted
on
certain
streets
and
not
others,
and
it
always
seems
to
occur
in
public
streets.
here,
we're
taking
them
off
the
public
street,
even
though
a
public
street
is
right
there
for
the
use
and
seeking
to
put
them
on
private
property,
or
even
quasi
public
property.
the
idea
in
the
previous
cases
of
putting
them
on
public
property
was
for
the
--
private
property
was
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
substantial
detriment
to
the
exercise
of
free
speech
rights
because
of
the
unavailability
of
public
property
in
the
area.
that
is
the
rationale,
the
underlying
theme
in
logan
valley.
we'll
let
them
on
the
shopping
center
premises
because
they
can't
stand
on
the
middle
of
the
highway,
and
even
if
they
were
there,
their
message
could
not
be
brought
to
the
people
entering
the
store.
we
don't
have
this
situation
here.
the
message
could
be
brought.
it
is
not
the
duty
of
the
property
owner
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
there
appear
to
be
some
there.
i
don't
--
there'
s
a
public
sidewalk
for
that.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
the
pictures
indicate
that
this
premises
and
we
have
a
picture
of
the
back
of
the
store
too.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
and
there
are
some
in
front
and
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
seven
pickets
to
cover
all
them.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
they
have
to
be
looking
in
that
direction
in
any
how,
they're
crossing
a
public
sidewalk
to
get
into
the
lot.
so
they're
looking
for
pedestrians.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes.
they
have
to
cross
the
public
sidewalk
to
drive
in,
which
they
do.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
those
who
are
sympathetic
with
the
message
being
imparted
to
them
will
turn
around
and
drive
out
and
those
who
are
not
sympathetic
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
--
this
is
what
i
called
attention
to
in
my
brief
as
well.
in
logan
valley,
they
drove
in
across
an
earthen
berm
to
a
large
shopping
center.
there
was
no
reason
to
assume
they
were
slowing
down
substantially
after
leaving
the
highway.
in
this
physical
situation,
the
car
has
to
cross
a
public
sidewalk,
it
goes
up
on
to
a
driveway,
crosses
a
public
sidewalk
and
goes
in
to
a
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
while
slowing
it's
certainly
going
slow
enough
to
read
the
sign
from
there,
but
that
is
not
the
major
contention.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it's
--
i
believe
a
residential
area
near
the
center
of
town.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
according
to
the
pictures
in
the
record,
it
appears
that
most
people
use
the
front
entrances,
although
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
pictures
i
have
here,
i'm
not
submitting
this
as
a
fact.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
at
the
back
of
the
store
in
exhibit
a5
indicates
that
there's
no
store
windows,
there's
no
entrances
to
the
major
selling
areas
and
it's
really
the
back
end
of
the
building.
whereas
the
next
in
the
several
photographs
indicate
the
front
door
which
is
the
one
probably
used
by
most
of
the
people,
although
it's
not
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
but
i
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
your
honor
i
really
don't
but
what
i
have
done
is
included
diagrams
of
the
city
of
mobile,
so
that
the
store
could
be
picked
out
off
the
map
itself.
they're
not
easy
to
read,
i
must
confess
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
city
myself.
well,
the
question
has
been
raised
and
i
must
address
myself
to
it
as
to
whether
or
not
the
entire
area
of
the
conduct
here
has
been
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
therefore
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
try
this
matter.
i
do
not
have
any
excuse
for
not
raising
it
as
it
was
found
in
previous
cases.
i
think
the
issue
is
clearly
before
this
court.
the
major
contention
in
support
of
a
finding
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
that
once
they
have
concluded
that
there
was
no
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
and
once
the
court
has
concluded
that
the
property
rights
of
the
respondent
to
conduct
its
lawful
business
are
being
jeopardized
by
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners,
the
court
below
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
petitioners
are
engaging
in
an
unlawful
act.
once
that
conclusion
is
reached
and
properly
so
if
that
a
conclusion
is
properly
so,
it
is
the
traditional
right
of
the
state
courts
to
provide
a
remedy
for
that
wrong.
the
cause
of
action
for
remedying
an
unlawful
trespassers
are
amongst
the
oldest
in
our
law.
the
state
of
alabama
below
followed
the
test
annunciated
by
this
court
for
the
determination
as
to
whether
petitioners
were
validly
exercising
first
amendment
rights.
they
found
that
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioners
to
move
them
away
100
feet,
and
that
it
would
seriously
impair
the
operation
of
respondent
to
allow
them
on
the
property.
this
is
the
balancing
test
earlier
described.
they
followed
the
law
in
that
respect,
and
then
they
found
that
there
was
a
trespasser,
an
unlawful
interfering
trespasser
on
the
property.
now
to
say
that
after
such
a
finding,
the
court
would
be
powerless
to
act,
would
mean
that
there
is
no
law
if
there
is
no
enforcement
of
it
here.
petitioner's
argument,
counsel
and
his
argument
says
he
doesn't
know
whether
they
asked
them
to
leave
or
how
would
get
up
before
the
board
or
not.
i
think
at
least
in
this
respect,
the
record
is
clear.
it's
stated
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
decision.
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
and
refused.
their
failure
to
leave
the
premises
left
the
employer
--
the
property
on
here
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
short
of
self-help.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
could've
removed
them
and
if
they
would've
resisted
them,
i
suppose
i
would've
had
a
hire
people
to
help
me,
or
to
get
a
gun
and
shoot
them.
that
would've
been
left,
had
they
failed
to
leave
--
had
the
state
court
no
jurisdiction
under
the
circumstances.
all
i
could
do
was
exert
greater
physical
force
than
they
were
capable
of
resisting
in
order
to
get
them
off
the
property.
there
is
no
procedure
by
which
a
property
owner
can
apply
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
have
pickets
removed.
and
this
would
be
true
if
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
store
or
sitting
on
the
checkout
counters
with
their
signs
and
saying
“don't
shop
here”
or
“don't
pay
for
what
you
buy”
or
“we
don't
like
this.”
there
was
no
way
to
go
the
board
to
do
this.
now
the
board
has
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
is
not.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
now
we
get
into
an
area
where
there
is
jurisdiction
between
the
state
courts
and
the
board.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
could
be,
yes.
in
cases
of
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
if
it
has
an
affect
on
other
employees,
you
would
be
able
to
bring
a
charge
under
8
(b)
(1).
if
it
was
for
some
unlawful
purpose
specified
in
the
act
such
as
a
secondary
boycott,
you
could
bring
it.
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
mass
picketing
interfered
with
his
business
would
not
give
the
board
jurisdiction
of
the
matter,
it'd
have
to
be
additional
facts.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
now,
these
facts
are
not
in
this
record
here,
and
we
submit
that
once
the
court
finds
an
unlawful
trespasser,
it's
no
different
in
unlawful
interfering
trespass,
it's
no
different
than
this
court
has
found
before
with
regard
to
libel
which
would
tend
to
provoke
violence,
mass
picketing
which
would
tend
to
provoke
violence.
threats
--
mere
threats
of
imminent
violence
when
it
was
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
violence
would
follow.
the
supreme
courts
of
several
states
have
held
that
failure
to
remedy
a
trespass
leads
to
imminent
violence.
this
is
the
traditional
area
for
the
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction,
absence
such
state
jurisdiction,
the
property
owner
would
find
them
remediless.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
followed
the
concepts
annunciated
by
this
court
in
prior
decisions
in
determining
whether
its
removal
of
the
pickets
from
this
parking
lot
impaired
the
free
speech
rights
of
the
petitioners,
finding
it
did
not,
and
finding
that
their
presence
on
the
premises
of
respondent
was
inimical
to
the
conduct
of
respondent's
business
they
precluded
them.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
availability
of
proximate
public
area
from
which
the
message
could
be
imparted
to
those
walking
in
and
out
of
the
store
for
one
thing.
and
second,
the
fact
that
this
property
was
not
open
to
the
general
public
to
the
extent
of
the
logan
valley
plaza
because
it
did
not
replace
a
business
district.
it
was
merely
a
store
in
a
district
set
back
from
a
public
street.
logan
valley,
if
you
didn't
find
the
way
you
did,
there
would
be
no
streets
or
sidewalks
in
the
area
from
which
people
could
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights.
this
is
the
traditional
place
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
and
the
shopping
center
there,
the
size
of
it
eliminated
the
traditional
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
on
the
other
hand
here,
the
traditional
place
is
available,
it's
a
hundred
feet
away.
you
can
see
from
there,
you
can
hear
from
there.
there's
been
no
impairment
whatsoever
of
communication,
which
is
we
submit
the
test
of
first
amendment
rights,
absent
some
protection
being
offered
by
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
remedy,
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out,
there
would
be
a
necessary
resort
to
self-help
and
the
concomitant
threat
to
the
public
order.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
certainly
do,
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
clearly,
because
there
would
be
a
greater
interference
with
the
business
relationship
which
is
what
is
intended,
but
that
is
not
the
obligation
of
preservation
of
first
amendment
rights
to
do
it
in
the
most
effective
place
merely
to
maintain
a
channel
of
communication.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
petitioner's
argument,
i
would
like
to
briefly
go
into
few
of
the
salient
facts
which
have
not
been
emphasized
to
discuss
further
from
these
facts.
they
indicate
that
the
character
and
nature
of
this
property
is
private
and
not
public.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
store
sells
groceries
and
drugs.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
there
were
small
hardware
department
as
well,
but
it
was
in
a
traditional
style
of
today's
supermarket,
including
groceries
and
drugs.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
don't
know
the
square
feet
involved.
there
is
a
picture
of
the
store
building
as
an
appendix
to
respondent's
brief.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
it
was
a
good
sized
grocery
store,
very
large
sized
supermarket
grocery
store.
going
on
from
the
argument
that
this
property
was
private
rather
than
public
under
any
concept
of
this
court,
it
is
our
contention
that
even
if
the
property
were
to
be
held
quasi
public
under
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
state
of
alabama
did
no
more
than
reasonably
regulate
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioners.
and
finally
that
in
doing
so,
the
alabama
court
exercised
its
proper
jurisdiction
in
accordance
with
its
traditional
rights
to
remedy
a
wrong
against
property
and
persons
within
its
jurisdiction
and
subject
to
its
protection.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
that
we
discussed
a
moment
ago,
the
building
is
set
back
from
the
street.
this
is
a
supermarket
with
a
parking
lot,
it
is
large.
the
parking
lot
is
large
as
well.
however,
the
major
portion
of
the
parking
lot
is
not
between
this
public
street
and
the
store.
the
parking
lot
surrounds
the
store.
at
the
front
of
the
store,
there
is
room
for
two
rows
of
parking.
one
facing
the
store,
one
facing
the
street
and
an
isle
between
them
for
cars
to
maneuver
within
the
parking
lot,
directly
adjacent
to
this
parking
lot
is
a
broad
public
sidewalk
running
the
full
length
of
the
street,
the
public
street
upon
which
the
store
faces.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
the
plat
on
40,
if
you
would
like
a
diagram
of
the
property.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
a40.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
a40
shows
the
store
and
diagrams
the
distances
between
the
store
and
the
public
street.
i
think
the
best
picture
of
the
premises
is
probably
a7
which
is
a
photograph
indicating
exactly
what
i'm
discussing
now,
the
two
rows
of
parking
and
the
public
street.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
as
far
as
i'm
able
to
ascertain
from
the
opinions
of
the
court
and
the
record,
it
took
place
on
the
sidewalk
--
the
public
sidewalk
first
then
at
various
places
in
the
parking
lot
as
well
as
the
sidewalk
directly
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
to
the
store
building.
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
affirming
the
lower
court,
they
found
that
the
pickets
were
in
the
way
of
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
store,
so
presumably
they
must
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
right
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
front
door.
they
did
not
come
in
to
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
they
did
not
come
in
to
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
that
i'd
have
difficulty
either
quarreling
with
it
or
accepting
it
in
this
court.
it
was
based
upon
affidavits
and
support
of
a
petition
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that
said
obstructing
(voice
overlap)
that
was
the
word.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
could
mean
that
their
presence
was
in
the
way
of
those
--
their
physical
presence
was
in
the
way
of
those
coming
in
and
out
of
the
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
suppose
they
could
have.
it
would
be
a
fair
construction
that
anywhere
on
the
lot
they
may
have
been
obstructing
the
conduct
of
respondent's
business.
however,
i
don't
think
the
burden
is
on
me
to
substantiate
that
finding
in
this
court
when
two
occasions
in
the
lower
courts,
petitioners
failed
to
avail
themselves
in
statutory
provisions
for
supplying
counter
affidavits.
they
could've
had
their
hearing
if
they
wanted
it
then,
they
just
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
do
not
think
there
is,
unless
the
court
wants
it.
i
think
that
is
a
discretionary
matter,
but
i
do
know
that
under
two
sections
of
the
alabama
code,
they
could
have
filed
counter
affidavits
and
did
not
do
so.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
had
a
hearing.
they
had
a
hearing
based
upon
the
record
in
front
of
the
court
at
that
time
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
affidavits
of
the
respondent
only.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
a
hearing.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it's
sufficient
for
permanent
injunction
under
alabama
law.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
it
hasn't
been
challenged
in
this
court
as
a
failure
to
grant
petitioners
due
process
of
law
under
the
united
states
constitution.
that
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
court.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
two
separate
provisions
of
the
alabama
code
give
them
that
right.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
judge
accepted
the
evidence
before
him,
which
were
the
affidavits
of
respondent
alone.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
record
does
not
indicate.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
is
not
so
indicated
in
the
record.
it
appears
from
the
record
that
the
only
argument
raised
by
petitioners
in
the
lower
court
was
not
a
factual
argument.
they
quarreled
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
was
their
sole
contention
before
the
court
below.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
i
claim
it
on
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
claim
it
that
the
court
in
precluding
the
pickets
from
coming
on
to
this
limited
property
were
within
their
jurisdiction
and
acted
properly
and
that
they
had
the
right
to
move
the
pickets,
in
effect,
100
feet
away
by
moving
them
on
to
a
public
sidewalk,
a
safe
and
proximate
place
to
stand
only
100
feet
from
the
front
door
of
the
respondent's
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
did
not
make
myself
clear.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
court
did
not
enjoin
picketing
per
se.
the
court
said
“there
will
be
no
picketing
allowed
on
the
premises
of
the
respondent
only”.
what
the
effect
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
the
only
injunction.
the
pickets
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
not
at
all.
the
pickets
have
every
right
today
to
go
out
to
the
public
sidewalk
100
feet
from
the
front
door
of
the
respondent's
property
and
picket.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
anywhere
in
the
parking
lot
at
all.
anywhere
within
the
lot
lines
of
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
within
that
parking
lot
and
on
the
petitioner's
walk
directly
in
front
of
the
front
door
of
its
premises.
the
picketing
took
place
right
at
the
store.
the
public
sidewalk
open
to
the
pickets
now
is
100
feet
away
from
the
front
door.
they
are
moved
100
feet
by
this
injunction
that
is
presently
pending.
now,
our
contention
is
that
this
is
private
property
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
unlike
petitioner's
claim,
we
do
not
believe
that
openness
to
the
public
is
the
only
viable
standard.
that
principle
brings
us
smack
into
a
dichotomy
with
their
position
on
no
claim
to
coming
into
the
store
itself.
the
same
standard
being
applied
in
the
two
circumstances,
the
store
and
the
parking
lot
would
allow
the
pickets
into
the
store.
this
was
not
a
reasonable
standard
and
this
is
not
in
our
opinion,
what
the
court
meant
in
its
decision
in
logan
valley,
calling
private
property
quasi
public
or
available
for
public
use
or
open
to
the
public.
in
that
case,
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
marge
versus
alabama,
it
wasn't
the
openness
to
the
public
which
was
the
sole
standard.
it
was
the
use
by
the
public
in
a
particular
way.
the
public
used
the
property
in
these
previous
cases
as
a
sidewalk,
as
a
part,
as
a
thorough
fair
to
go
from
one
place
to
another,
or
as
the
court
said
in
logan
valley,
“freely
open
to
the
public
in
the
area
and
those
passing
through.”
the
parking
lot
in
this
store
is
not
freely
open
to
the
public
and
those
passing
through.
nobody
passes
through
this
parking
that
is
not
going
into
the
weinacker's
store
building.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
oh,
yes.
oh!
there
is
no
statement
in
the
record
that
the
general
public
does
not
use
this
property.
the
only
statement
in
the
record
is
that
it
is
private
property,
and
as
private
property,
without
an
indication
that
it
is
used
as
a
public
thorough
fair,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
public
thorough
fair
directly
adjacent
to
it,
a
public
sidewalk
directly
adjacent
to
it
would
indicate
that
there's
no
need
for
this
private
property
to
be
used
as
public
property.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
would
not.
they
would
be
allowed
to
walk
into
the
store.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
because
any
store
then
is
public.
any
store
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
what
is
the
difference?
i
see
no
difference
between
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
is
when
they
conduct
their
selves
in
of
manner
that
is
inimical
to
the
conduct
to
the
business
on
the
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
carrying
a
picket
sign,
throwing
a
bomb.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
anything
they
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
no
but
anything
they
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
correct.
the
picket
sign
because
of
its
effect
of
being
inimical
to
the
conduct
to
the
business.
and
we
submit
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
as
much
protection
of
his
conduct
of
a
business
as
the
picket
sign
to
come
on
and
utilize
their
most
effective
economic
weapon
against
the
respondent.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that
would've
tended
to
indicate
that
the
property
was
less
open
to
the
public.
it
wouldn't
be
a
usual
manner
of
conducting
a
retail
business.
we
do
concede
this
is
a
retail
business
open
generally
to
the
public
to
come
on
to
the
property
and
shop.
we
wanted
the
public
in
our
premises.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
general
public.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
because
there
the
general
public
is
conducting
themselves
detrimental
to
our
conduct
of
our
business.
they
are
interfering
with
our
right
to
conduct
the
business.
they
are
not
there
to
buy.
assuming
that
we
do
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
there
was
no
part
of
it
being
used
by
the
general
public
other
than
the
instance
of
the
pickets
or
the
people
who
came
to
buy
in
the
store.
this
was
not
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
people
walked
across
this
property
to
go
from
one
place
to
another.
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
came
on
to
this
property
to
park
their
car
while
they
went
to
visit
friends
in
the
neighborhood.
this
was
just
a
grocery
store
and
the
only
instance
in
the
record
of
people
using
it
other
than
the
shop
is
the
use
by
the
pickets
here.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
they
varied
from
time
to
time.
i
don't
really
know
what
the
maximum
number
was.
i
don't
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
the
contention
here
or
that
is
an
issue.
we
believe
that
we
have
the
right
to
exclude
every
single
one
of
them
for
two
reasons.
one,
that
this
is
private
property
and
the
private
property
owner
has
the
right
to
seek
remedy
from
the
presence
of
a
person
who
is
disrupting
its
business
in
any
way.
and
two
that
even
if
under
the
standards
of
this
court,
this
property
because
it
is
a
retail
business,
parking
lot,
is
held
to
be
quasi
public.
it's
still
reserved
to
the
lower
court
the
right
to
reasonably
regulate
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
moving
the
pickets
100
feet
where
they
are
still
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
front
door
is
a
reasonable
regulation.
now,
how
do
we
differ
this
from
--
or
distinguish
this
from
logan
valley?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
you
could
find
this
as
private
property.
if
this
is
private
property,
they
could
be
excluded,
that's
traditional.
a
man
who
owns
property
can
exclude
anybody
whose
interests
are
opposed
to
himself.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
agree.
that
is
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
the
secondary
contention.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
you
can
agree
with
me
on
my
prior
contention
and
come
to
the
same
result
whether
or
not
the
regulation
is
reasonable,
because
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
right
because
the
general
public
does
not
have
free
speech
rights
on
private
property.
there's
no
free
speech
right.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
handicap
is
right,
i
agree
with
that,
but
they
could
regulate
the
place
at
which
free
speech
is
to
be
conducted.
the
place,
the
location
of
the
free
--
as
one
as
it
may
have
been
--
one
of
the
justices
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
and
i
am
saying
that
an
injunction
which
merely
moves
people
100
feet
with
nothing
intervening
along
that
100-foot
distance
to
block
the
reading
of
a
picket
sign,
or
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
voice
coming
from
a
hundred
feet
away,
does
not
unreasonably
interfere
with
the
communication
of
ideas.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
the
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
don't
say
handicap,
but
i
see
no
handicap
for
the
exact
channel
of
communication
that's
being
requested
by
the
pickets
is
still
open
to
them
and
all
they
are
being
told
is
to
move
a
hundred
feet.
that
is
not
a
handicap
to
communication.
petitioners
are
alleging
that
makes
their
communication
less
effective.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
it
would
be
a
handicap
that
this
court
i'm
sure
would
find
so
serious
that
they
would
be
willing
to
then
handicap
free
speech
and
preserve
the
rights
in
the
home.
the
idea
when
we
have
a
conflicting
constitutional
right
being
claimed
by
two
parties
is
that
this
court
and
other
courts
have
looked
to
the
detriment
to
one
by
upholding
the
other.
in
the
case
of
a
home,
somebody
coming
into
a
home,
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
the
damage
to
the
privacy
of
the
home,
a
right
guaranteed
to
the
home
owner
would
be
so
severe
that
the
handicap
to
free
speech
would
be
ordered.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
would
be
required
to
stand
out
public
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
home
or
the
nearest
area
traditionally
available
for
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
they
may
not
be
free
to
do
it
at
all.
this
court
has
upheld
regulation
of
the
use
of
soundtracks,
even
city
streets.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
and
it
maybe
only
permitted
on
certain
streets
and
not
others,
and
it
always
seems
to
occur
in
public
streets.
here,
we're
taking
them
off
the
public
street,
even
though
a
public
street
is
right
there
for
the
use
and
seeking
to
put
them
on
private
property,
or
even
quasi
public
property.
the
idea
in
the
previous
cases
of
putting
them
on
public
property
was
for
the
--
private
property
was
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
substantial
detriment
to
the
exercise
of
free
speech
rights
because
of
the
unavailability
of
public
property
in
the
area.
that
is
the
rationale,
the
underlying
theme
in
logan
valley.
we'll
let
them
on
the
shopping
center
premises
because
they
can't
stand
on
the
middle
of
the
highway,
and
even
if
they
were
there,
their
message
could
not
be
brought
to
the
people
entering
the
store.
we
don't
have
this
situation
here.
the
message
could
be
brought.
it
is
not
the
duty
of
the
property
owner
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
there
appear
to
be
some
there.
i
don't
--
there'
s
a
public
sidewalk
for
that.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
think
the
pictures
indicate
that
this
premises
and
we
have
a
picture
of
the
back
of
the
store
too.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes,
and
there
are
some
in
front
and
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
seven
pickets
to
cover
all
them.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
they
have
to
be
looking
in
that
direction
in
any
how,
they're
crossing
a
public
sidewalk
to
get
into
the
lot.
so
they're
looking
for
pedestrians.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
yes.
they
have
to
cross
the
public
sidewalk
to
drive
in,
which
they
do.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
those
who
are
sympathetic
with
the
message
being
imparted
to
them
will
turn
around
and
drive
out
and
those
who
are
not
sympathetic
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
i
--
this
is
what
i
called
attention
to
in
my
brief
as
well.
in
logan
valley,
they
drove
in
across
an
earthen
berm
to
a
large
shopping
center.
there
was
no
reason
to
assume
they
were
slowing
down
substantially
after
leaving
the
highway.
in
this
physical
situation,
the
car
has
to
cross
a
public
sidewalk,
it
goes
up
on
to
a
driveway,
crosses
a
public
sidewalk
and
goes
in
to
a
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
while
slowing
it's
certainly
going
slow
enough
to
read
the
sign
from
there,
but
that
is
not
the
major
contention.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it's
--
i
believe
a
residential
area
near
the
center
of
town.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
according
to
the
pictures
in
the
record,
it
appears
that
most
people
use
the
front
entrances,
although
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
the
pictures
i
have
here,
i'm
not
submitting
this
as
a
fact.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
at
the
back
of
the
store
in
exhibit
a5
indicates
that
there's
no
store
windows,
there's
no
entrances
to
the
major
selling
areas
and
it's
really
the
back
end
of
the
building.
whereas
the
next
in
the
several
photographs
indicate
the
front
door
which
is
the
one
probably
used
by
most
of
the
people,
although
it's
not
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
but
i
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
no,
your
honor
i
really
don't
but
what
i
have
done
is
included
diagrams
of
the
city
of
mobile,
so
that
the
store
could
be
picked
out
off
the
map
itself.
they're
not
easy
to
read,
i
must
confess
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
city
myself.
well,
the
question
has
been
raised
and
i
must
address
myself
to
it
as
to
whether
or
not
the
entire
area
of
the
conduct
here
has
been
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
therefore
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
try
this
matter.
i
do
not
have
any
excuse
for
not
raising
it
as
it
was
found
in
previous
cases.
i
think
the
issue
is
clearly
before
this
court.
the
major
contention
in
support
of
a
finding
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
that
once
they
have
concluded
that
there
was
no
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
and
once
the
court
has
concluded
that
the
property
rights
of
the
respondent
to
conduct
its
lawful
business
are
being
jeopardized
by
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners,
the
court
below
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
petitioners
are
engaging
in
an
unlawful
act.
once
that
conclusion
is
reached
and
properly
so
if
that
a
conclusion
is
properly
so,
it
is
the
traditional
right
of
the
state
courts
to
provide
a
remedy
for
that
wrong.
the
cause
of
action
for
remedying
an
unlawful
trespassers
are
amongst
the
oldest
in
our
law.
the
state
of
alabama
below
followed
the
test
annunciated
by
this
court
for
the
determination
as
to
whether
petitioners
were
validly
exercising
first
amendment
rights.
they
found
that
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioners
to
move
them
away
100
feet,
and
that
it
would
seriously
impair
the
operation
of
respondent
to
allow
them
on
the
property.
this
is
the
balancing
test
earlier
described.
they
followed
the
law
in
that
respect,
and
then
they
found
that
there
was
a
trespasser,
an
unlawful
interfering
trespasser
on
the
property.
now
to
say
that
after
such
a
finding,
the
court
would
be
powerless
to
act,
would
mean
that
there
is
no
law
if
there
is
no
enforcement
of
it
here.
petitioner's
argument,
counsel
and
his
argument
says
he
doesn't
know
whether
they
asked
them
to
leave
or
how
would
get
up
before
the
board
or
not.
i
think
at
least
in
this
respect,
the
record
is
clear.
it's
stated
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
decision.
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
and
refused.
their
failure
to
leave
the
premises
left
the
employer
--
the
property
on
here
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
short
of
self-help.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
could've
removed
them
and
if
they
would've
resisted
them,
i
suppose
i
would've
had
a
hire
people
to
help
me,
or
to
get
a
gun
and
shoot
them.
that
would've
been
left,
had
they
failed
to
leave
--
had
the
state
court
no
jurisdiction
under
the
circumstances.
all
i
could
do
was
exert
greater
physical
force
than
they
were
capable
of
resisting
in
order
to
get
them
off
the
property.
there
is
no
procedure
by
which
a
property
owner
can
apply
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
have
pickets
removed.
and
this
would
be
true
if
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
store
or
sitting
on
the
checkout
counters
with
their
signs
and
saying
“don't
shop
here”
or
“don't
pay
for
what
you
buy”
or
“we
don't
like
this.”
there
was
no
way
to
go
the
board
to
do
this.
now
the
board
has
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
is
not.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
well,
now
we
get
into
an
area
where
there
is
jurisdiction
between
the
state
courts
and
the
board.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
it
could
be,
yes.
in
cases
of
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
if
it
has
an
affect
on
other
employees,
you
would
be
able
to
bring
a
charge
under
8
(b)
(1).
if
it
was
for
some
unlawful
purpose
specified
in
the
act
such
as
a
secondary
boycott,
you
could
bring
it.
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
mass
picketing
interfered
with
his
business
would
not
give
the
board
jurisdiction
of
the
matter,
it'd
have
to
be
additional
facts.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
now,
these
facts
are
not
in
this
record
here,
and
we
submit
that
once
the
court
finds
an
unlawful
trespasser,
it's
no
different
in
unlawful
interfering
trespass,
it's
no
different
than
this
court
has
found
before
with
regard
to
libel
which
would
tend
to
provoke
violence,
mass
picketing
which
would
tend
to
provoke
violence.
threats
--
mere
threats
of
imminent
violence
when
it
was
reasonable
to
anticipate
that
violence
would
follow.
the
supreme
courts
of
several
states
have
held
that
failure
to
remedy
a
trespass
leads
to
imminent
violence.
this
is
the
traditional
area
for
the
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction,
absence
such
state
jurisdiction,
the
property
owner
would
find
them
remediless.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
followed
the
concepts
annunciated
by
this
court
in
prior
decisions
in
determining
whether
its
removal
of
the
pickets
from
this
parking
lot
impaired
the
free
speech
rights
of
the
petitioners,
finding
it
did
not,
and
finding
that
their
presence
on
the
premises
of
respondent
was
inimical
to
the
conduct
of
respondent's
business
they
precluded
them.
mr.
shayle

the
availability
of
proximate
public
area
from
which
the
message
could
be
imparted
to
those
walking
in
and
out
of
the
store
for
one
thing.
and
second,
the
fact
that
this
property
was
not
open
to
the
general
public
to
the
extent
of
the
logan
valley
plaza
because
it
did
not
replace
a
business
district.
it
was
merely
a
store
in
a
district
set
back
from
a
public
street.
logan
valley,
if
you
didn't
find
the
way
you
did,
there
would
be
no
streets
or
sidewalks
in
the
area
from
which
people
could
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights.
this
is
the
traditional
place
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
and
the
shopping
center
there,
the
size
of
it
eliminated
the
traditional
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
rights.
on
the
other
hand
here,
the
traditional
place
is
available,
it's
a
hundred
feet
away.
you
can
see
from
there,
you
can
hear
from
there.
there's
been
no
impairment
whatsoever
of
communication,
which
is
we
submit
the
test
of
first
amendment
rights,
absent
some
protection
being
offered
by
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
there
would
be
absolutely
no
remedy,
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out,
there
would
be
a
necessary
resort
to
self-help
and
the
concomitant
threat
to
the
public
order.
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
i
certainly
do,
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
shayle
p.
fox
clearly,
because
there
would
be
a
greater
interference
with
the
business
relationship
which
is
what
is
intended,
but
that
is
not
the
obligation
of
preservation
of
first
amendment
rights
to
do
it
in
the
most
effective
place
merely
to
maintain
a
channel
of
communication.
