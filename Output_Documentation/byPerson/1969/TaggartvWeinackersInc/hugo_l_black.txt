mr.

is
a

and
they
agreed?
justice

black
they're
in
agreement?
justice

l.
black
well,
do
you
mind
telling
me
just
where
on
the
premises
the
picketing
was
taking
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
have
a
shelter
in
front
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
right
immediately
where
the
customers
drive
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
their
packages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
picketing
was
right
there
where
they
walk
down
or?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
are
no
findings
on
that
or
no
map?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
store
sell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
the
picketing
take
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
the
picketing
take
place
that
the
alabama
court
enjoined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
sidewalk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
not
come
in
to
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
offered
an
opportunity
to
file
counter
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the

do
about
it?
justice

l.
black
did
he
suggest
or
ask
about
any
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
lawyers
ask
for
the
right
to
offer
any
counter
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
claiming
here
that
the
court
had
a
right
to
enjoin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
what
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
court
enjoined
picketing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
public
sidewalk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
not
enjoin
picketing
on
the
sidewalk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construe
that
as
a
meaning
enjoined
in
being
anywhere
--
picketing
anywhere
in
the
parking
lot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
where
did
it
actually
take
place
according
to
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
a
fence
around
the
place,
or
the
guard
fence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
general
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
including
picket?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
contention
here
is
that
any
part
of
that
property
was
to
be
decreed
by
the
law
from
people
who
did
not
come
to
buy
goods
from
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
no
one
have
to
agree
with
that
argument
of
yours,
to
agree
with
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understood
that
you
are
arguing
that
the
reason,
so
long
as
you
hamper
the
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
in
a
reasonable
way
you
can
hamper
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
have
to
decide,
but
you
decide
on
your
--
to
be
on
your
side
to
agree
with
you
on
that
handicap
to
the
excise
of
free
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'll
just
say
to
you
that
there
have
to
be
something
like
that
before
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
judges
or
the
congress
can
reasonably,
according
to
their
judgment
on
what's
reasonable,
handicap
the
right
of
free
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
don't
have
the
right
to
take
side
of
free
speech
at
any
place
and
at
any
time
in
any
way
they
choose,
i
can
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
alright
for
other
members
of
the
court
i
presume,
but
i
can
get
along
better
with
my
understanding,
if
i
don't
have
to
bring
in
your
word
reasonably.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
--
if
it
is
a
right
to
handicap
free
speech
whether
court
thinks
it
reasonable
then
i
don't
understand
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
be
a
handicap,
but
that
doesn't
serve
the
purpose,
doesn't
it?
it
would
be
a
handicap
to
keep
people
from
coming
into
your
home
in
day
or
night
in
order
to
argue
with
you
on
public
question.
that
would
be
a
handicap,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
you
are
saying
in
effect
is,
they
wouldn't
have
right
to
go
into
the
home
in
order
to
exercise
the
right
of
free
speech
against
their
owner's
consent?
justice
hugo
l.

do
you
know
enough
about
mobile
than
know
just
about

justice

that
was

mr.

you
don't
live

justice

maybe
you
couldn't
answer
this
question,
but
i
know
a
little
about
mobile
and
i
was
wondering
as
one
on
your
side
on
mobile
that
could
place
this,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
in
relation
to
the
center
of
the
town
where
they
have
the
hotel.
