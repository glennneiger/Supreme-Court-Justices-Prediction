mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
can
be
put
in
a
nutshell.
picketing
takes
place
in
front
of
a
store
to
support
a
strike
by
that
store's
employees
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
picketing
is
prohibited
by
a
state
injunction
as
a
trespass
because
it
takes
place
on
a
sidewalk
which
is
publicly
used,
is
privately
owned.
we
have
three
questions.
first,
does
the
prohibition
violate
the
first
amendment?
second,
is
the
controversy
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
because
the
subject
matter
is
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board?
third,
if
the
state
court
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
does
the
prohibition
conflict
with
the
federally
protected
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act
to
engage
--
of
a
national
labor
relations
act,
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection?
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
situation
is
in
a
nutshell,
the
questions
proliferate.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
sir
our
primary
position
is
that
this
controversy
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
logan
valley.
mr.
bernard
dunau
logan
valley
your
honor,
amalgamated
food
employees
v.
logan
valley
plaza.
the
store
which
was
picketed
is
located
in
mobile,
alabama.
it
sold
dry
goods,
groceries,
drugs,
other
merchandise.
the
store
building
is
surrounded
by
a
private
sidewalk
publicly
used.
the
sidewalk
is
surrounded
by
a
parking
lot
privately
owned,
but
publicly
used.
the
parking
lot
is
surrounded
by
public
streets.
there
are
seven
automobile
entrances
into
this
parking
lot.
the
distance
from
the
nearest
automobile
entrance
to
the
picketed
area
is
a
115
feet.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
can't
say.
the
record
does
not
--
those
who
enter
park
free,
there
is
no
showing
that
there's
any
charge
for
parking
on
that
lot.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
there
is
no
showing
of
restriction
to
any
element
of
the
public.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
do
not
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
the
question
whether
when
you
have
a
public
situs,
you
may
have
picketing
or
other
demonstrations
or
other
exercise
of
free
speech
with
respect
to
a
matter
not
connected
with
that
situs.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
protesters
related
to
the
operation
of
a
shopping
center
and
therefore
we
do
not
have
to
and
we
should
not
reach
in
this
case
the
question
whether
when
the
situs
is
public,
but
the
protest
relates
to
a
matter
other
than
the
situs,
whether
the
locus
is
appropriate
for
the
expression
of
pre-amendment
rights.
the
second
circuit
has
decided
that
it
was.
i
believe
the
california
supreme
court
has
also
decided
that
it
makes
no
difference,
but
we
do
not
have
that
question
in
this
case.
the
story
here
begins
on
december
19,
1963.
the
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
be
certified
as
the
representative
of
the
store's
employees.
on
april
16,
1964
the
union
was
certified
as
the
representative.
in
august
and
september
of
1964,
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
issued
alleging
massive
unfair
labor
practices
including
nine
discriminatory
discharges
of
a
group
of
40
or
50
employees
and
the
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
on
june
25,
1965,
the
nlrb
issued
a
decision
affirming,
sustaining
the
complaint
in
full.
on
january
28,
1966,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
summarily
enforced
the
nlrb's
order.
meanwhile,
on
december
12,
1964,
a
strike
of
a
store
employees
was
begun.
negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
had
broken
down.
on
january
22,
1965,
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
sought
and
obtained,
restraining
the
picketing,
enjoining
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
store
as
a
trespass.
that
ex
parte
injunction
was
continued
on
march
26,
1965
after
a
non-evidentiary
hearing.
on
april
9,
an
appeal
was
taken,
in
1965
on
november
10,
the
appeal
was
argued
and
submitted.
on
september
19,
1968,
three-and-a-half
years
after
the
appeal
was
taken
and
three
years
after
it
was
argued,
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
that
the
injunction
should
be
affirmed.
it
said
that
the
controversy
was
not
preempted
to
the
labor
board.
the
injunction
did
not
prohibit
section
7
rights
and
it
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
the
record
is
silent
with
respect
to
the
reason
for
the
delay.
meanwhile,
on
may
20,
1968,
four
months
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
this
case,
this
court
decided
amalgamated
food
employees
v.
logan
valley
plaza.
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
peaceful
picketing
and
handbilling
could
not
be
prohibited
within
a
shopping
center
on
the
ground
that
the
shopping
center
grounds
were
owned
privately.
we
think
there
is
no
distinction
between
logan
valley
and
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
only
two
orders
was
the
ex
parte
injunction
and
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
at
that
time,
it
was
a
temporary
injunction.
then
on
--
two
months
later,
it
was
continued
until
further
modification
in
accordance
with
due
process
of
law.
in
other
words,
from
the
non-evidentiary
hearing,
two
months
later,
the
injunction
was
to
continue
indefinitely
unless
terminated
or
modified
by
the
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know
how
one
would
characterize
an
injunction
which
is
to
continue
indefinitely.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
did
not.
it's
the
identical
injunction
that
was
before
this
court
in
logan
valley.
it
terminated
all
federal
questions.
there
is
nothing
that
meet
and
can
go
back
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
with
respect
to
any
federal
question,
in
addition
since
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
preemption
presented
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
injunction
would
be
termed
final
within
this
court's
meaning
of
that
term,
would
not
make
any
difference
because
with
respect
to
a
preempted
question,
we
can
get
here
on
a
temporary
as
well
as
a
permanent
injunction,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
this
injunction
is
final.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
i
don't
say
that
the
rule
that
there
must
be
a
final
judgment
as
eliminated,
but
the
final
judgment
rule
is
satisfied
in
a
case
of
preemption
by
an
order
which
is
in
the
form
of
temporary.
that
meets
the
final
judgment
rule
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
it's
in
the
brief
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
underlying
labor
dispute
has
long
been
there
your
honor.
what
remains
now
is
that
the
injunction
still
is
operative
to
preclude
any
picketing
on
those
grounds
whether
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
strike
of
the
stores
which
are
presently
operating
or
in
furtherance
of
organizational
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
particular
labor
dispute
which
gave
rise
to
this
controversy
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
the
particular
controversy
is
that
the
injunction
is
very
much
alive
and
is
available
at
any
time
that
the
union
or
another
labor
organization
or
employees
would
seek
to
resume
picketing
within
the
grounds
of
this
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
same
--
well,
there
has
been
since
the
certification
a
change
in
ownership
so
that
the
store
which
was
originally
involved
has
now
instead
of
operating
the
store
has
leased
its
premises
to
two
others.
whether
that
lease
of
the
premises
and
the
change
of
ownership
has
affected
the
nlrb
certification
is
itself
a
substantial
question,
but
the
labor
organization
has
stuck
--
it
still
exists
and
it
still
represents
employees
in
this
general
locale
and
is
still
certainly
available
to
resume
organization
or
other
picketing
with
respect
to
the
stores
which
are
now
within
that
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
are
available
at
any
time
to
start
organizing
the
employees
within
the
two
stores
that
are
now
occupying
these
premises
and
the
injunction
as
it
presently
operates
would
preclude
entry
upon
those
premises
in
order
to
picket
in
furtherance
of
any
dispute
with
those
two
stores.
so
that
the
injunction
continues
at
the
present
time
to
be
fully
operative
to
bar
the
union
or
representatives
of
the
union
or
employees
from
picketing
at
the
entrance
of
either
of
the
stores
which
are
presently
occupying
the
premises.
the
injunction
reads
flatly,
prohibits
trespassing
upon
weinacker's
property.
it
remains
weinacker's
property.
there
are
stores
functioning
on
weinacker's
property
at
any
time
when
it
becomes
appropriate
to
picket
those
stores
or
to
handbill
those
stores,
this
injunction
precludes
entry
into
the
property
for
that
purpose,
so
we
have
a
--
continue
to
have
a
live
controversy.
i
said
that
in
our
view,
logan
valley
controls
this
case.
the
essence
of
logan
valley
as
we
see
it
is
that
when
an
employer
opens
his
property
to
the
public,
to
customers
in
order
to
come
to
this
store
to
buy,
to
others
in
the
community
in
order
to
operate
his
store
that
employer
cannot
close
that
property
to
employees
and
seek
to
publicize
the
store's
disfavored
labor
policy.
the
only
difference
between
logan
valley
and
this
case
is
that
the
real
estate
here
is
smaller
than
it
was
in
logan
valley.
in
logan
valley,
the
distances
from
the
public
entrances
to
the
picketed
area
were
from
350
feet
to
400
and
500
feet.
in
this
case,
the
distances
are
115
feet
to
385
feet.
in
a
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
which
following
logan
valley,
the
court
said
--
the
california
supreme
court
said
with
respect
to
a
single
shop
owner
that
logan
valley
requires
that
picketing
--
that
handbilling
be
permitted
on
the
private
sidewalk
serving
that
individual
store
owner
because
the
sidewalk
was
publicly
used.
the
distances
were
150
feet
to
280
feet.
we
do
not
think
that
the
appropriateness
of
the
property
as
a
place
for
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
a
dispute
which
relates
to
the
operation
on
that
property
can
be
sized
by
whether
it's
350
feet,
400,
500
feet,
150
feet,
280
feet
or
whatever
the
distances
may
be.
to
us,
it
seems
that
the
only
viable
standard
can
be
the
openness
of
a
property
to
a
public
entry.
once
it's
open,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
distances
which
are
open
are
115
feet
or
400
to
500
feet.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it
seem
to
say
not
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
shopping
center,
but
that
it
involves
a
smaller
shopping
center.
at
the
time,
it
affirmed
the
injunction,
it
had
only
one
store
operating.
so
that
there
is
of
course
a
clear
distinction
between
a
one
store
operation
and
a
shopping
center
which
has
more
than
one
store,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
have
any
relevance
at
any
time
whether
one
owner
opens
a
property
or
several
owners
opened
the
property
could
hardly
make
a
difference.
at
the
present
time,
there
are
in
fact
two
stores
operating
on
that
property
so
we
have
a
shopping
center
in
almost
the
most
colloquial
notion
of
that
term.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
but
we
need
to
remember
that
insofar
as
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned,
in
logan
valley,
the
action
was
brought
both
by
the
lessor
and
by
the
store
operator
and
no
one
ever
suggested
that
the
lessor
did
not
have
an
adequate
interest
to
preclude
entry
upon
that
property.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
not
suburban,
it's
downtown
mobile
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
we
make
no
such
claim.
the
right
of
picketing
extends
as
it
would
where
the
store
to
front
on
a
public
street,
to
the
immediate
entrance
to
that
store
leaving
ample
room
for
ingress
and
egress
to
the
store.
we
make
no
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
be
inside
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
assuming
you
have
stands
which
are
open
rather
than
stores
which
have
cover
on
them,
i
see
no
difference.
there
have
to
be
public
ways
to
get
to
those
places
within
the
shopping
area.
so
long
as
they're
all
public
ways
and
there
is
a
public
way
in
front
of
a
particular
stand
that
you
have
a
dispute
with,
it
would
be
our
position
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
go
in
front
of
that
open
stand
so
long
as
it
is
open
property.
and
it
would
necessarily
have
to
be
because
there
is
no
other
way
for
a
customer
to
reach
that
stand
to
buy
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
think
they're
all
part
of
the
same
package
with
respect
to
a
shopping
center
your
honor.
the
window
shopper
is
a
potential
customer
and
you
would
just
soon
have
them
in
there
taking
to
look
at
what
you
have
in
your
windows
and
ultimately,
he's
going
to
get
into
that
store.
it's
the
openness
of
the
property.
the
very
fact
as
the
federation
in
its
amicus
brief
put
it
with
respect
to
the
character
of
all
stores
which
have
private
property
on
which
they
front
but
that
private
property
is
intended
for
use
to
enable
the
customer
to
come.
it
put
it
this
way
in
its
amicus
brief.
smaller,
such
retail
establishments
have
in
common
with
large
shopping
centers,
a
desire
to
maximize
the
accessibility
of
the
public
to
their
premises.
it
is
an
integral
component
of
every
retail
business
that
it
be
freely
open
to
the
public.
and
therefore,
our
position
that
whether
the
open
property
happens
to
be
smaller
or
larger
cannot
by
the
criterion
so
long
as
it's
open,
then
it
has
to
be
open
to
employees
to
publicize
that
this
labor
policy
of
a
particular
employer
operating
within
that
real
estate.
now,
in
this
case,
i
think
this
is
particularly
plain
because
here,
we
have
employees
of
that
very
store
who
want
to
picket
or
handbill
and
are
barred
from
those
very
premises.
now,
when
they're
working
for
that
store,
they
are
parking
their
car
on
that
parking
lot.
they're
using
those
walkways
and
they're
entering
the
same
entrance
in
order
to
get
to
work.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
those
employees
when
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
employment
terms
become
trespassers
instead
of
invitees
when
they
park
their
car
on
that
same
parking
lot,
walk
those
same
walkways,
but
this
time
picket
in
front
of
the
store.
you
don't
become
an
--
or
trespasser
rather
than
an
invitee
when
you
change
from
a
working
employee
to
a
striking
employee.
now,
we're
told
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
sure,
it's
more
than
speech,
but
it
was
more
than
speech
in
logan
valley
as
well.
and
more
than
speech
means
only
that
the
patrol
in
front
of
the
store
may
be
regulated
with
respect
to
the
number
of
pickets.
if
there
are
too
many
there
or
if
they
are
too
close
to
the
doorway
and
interfere
with
ingress
and
egress,
then
you
tell
them
to
get
away
from
the
doorway
and
picket
on
the
far
side
of
the
sidewalk,
that's
what
we
mean
by
regulation
of
the
plus
aspect
of
picketing.
we
do
not
mean
that
you
can
ban
it
all
together
from
an
otherwise
appropriate
open
place.
it's
suggested
in
this
case
that
there
was
actually
obstructed
picketing.
we'll
pass
the
question
whether
on
this
record,
it
is
possible
for
anyone
to
say
there
was
obstructed
picketing.
there
was
six
identically
worded
affidavits
which
said
there
was
obstructed
picketing.
there
was
an
answer
filed
by
the
union
which
said
there
was
no
obstructed
picketing
sworn
to
by
two
officers
of
the
union.
i
do
not
know
how
as
between
six
paper
swearers
on
the
one
side
and
two
paper
swearers
on
the
other
one
can
ever
find
a
fact
one
way
or
the
other.
you
need
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
suppose,
suppose
there
was
obstructive
picketing
in
this
case,
all
that
that
would
authorize
would
be
the
elimination
of
the
obstruction
and
not
the
elimination
of
picketing
and
that's
the
point
of
this
case
here.
the
court
says
the
alabama
supreme
court,
it
doesn't
look
to
us
as
if
the
picketing
at
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
would
a
materially
less
effective
than
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
store.
our
fundamental
answer
is
that's
the
wrong
question.
if
a
place
is
otherwise
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
free
speech
rights,
that
place
does
not
become
inappropriate
because
there
are
other
places
as
well
that
one
can
exercise
free
speech
rights.
but
if
one
is
to
look
to
comparative
effectiveness,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
picketing
and
handbilling
cannot
possibly
be
nearly
as
effective
at
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
as
it
is
in
front
of
a
store.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
handbilling;
i
don't
care
how
slowly
a
car
moves
from
a
public
street
through
an
entrance
into
a
parking
lot,
it's
still
moving
and
you
cannot
very
well
distribute
handbills
to
a
moving
vehicle
and
you
sure
can't
distribute
handbills
to
a
moving
vehicle
on
a
cold
day
when
those
windows
are
uptight
and
no
one
is
lowering
windows
to
receive
handbills
on
a
cold
day
and
once
those
people
are
in
the
parking
lot,
you
can't
get
to
them
to
distribute
handbills.
so
handbill
distribution
is
very
much
enfeebled
by
this
kind
of
an
injunction.
take
picketing
itself;
again,
when
you're
driving
a
car
through
an
entrance
into
a
parking
lot,
you're
not
paying
much
attention
to
pickets
or
what's
said
on
the
sign.
when
you
park
that
car
and
you're
moving
to
the
store,
those
pickets
are
on
back
of
you.
when
you
get
to
the
entrance,
there
is
no
message.
we
want
the
message
at
the
place
that
means
something
--
at
the
entrance
to
the
store.
now,
it's
perfectly
clear,
the
union
strenuously
wants
to
get
into
these
premises.
the
employer
strenuously
wants
to
keep
us
out.
neither
the
union
nor
the
employer
are
engaging
in
abstractions
with
respect
to
the
philosophical
reach
of
free
speech.
we
want
in
because
that's
where
the
picketing
and
handbilling
is
effective
and
the
employer
wants
us
out
for
the
same
reason
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
obvious.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
--
well,
not
in
the
record
sir
but
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
appended
a
diagram
of
the
property
and
there
are
like
diagrams
in
the
appendices
to
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
there
is
no
difference
with
respect
to
the
diagrams.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
they
say
ours
is
indecipherable.
i
think
theirs
is,
but
i
don't
think
either
of
us
claim
that
the
others
are
inaccurate
and
there
is
a
slight
difference
with
respect
to
how
many
feet
from
the
picketing
area
to
the
entrance.
but
that
depends
on
where
you
are
measuring
prominent,
what
terminal
point.
there
is
no
difference
in
the
accuracy
of
either
diagram.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
the
picketing
was
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
to
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
may
or
i'm
not
sure
now
whether
the
record
shows
whether
there
was
an
overhanging
porch.
there
may
or
may
not
have
been.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
are
--
in
this
shopping
center,
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there
is
a
particular
pickup
zone.
so
far
as
it
appears,
the
customer
still
simply
walks
out
of
the
store
and
goes
to
wherever
he
has
parked
his
car.
there
is
no
showing
of
a
pick
up
zone
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
picketing
was
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
store.
according
to
one
set
of
affidavits,
it
was
so
close
to
the
store
entrance
that
it
obstructed
ingress
and
egress.
according
to
our
version
of
it,
it
was
sufficiently
removed
so
it
did
not
obstruct
ingress
and
egress.
we
would
take
the
position
with
respect
to
that
matter
that
the
side
--
there
was
an
available
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
store
and
we
were
surely
entitled
to
picket
on
the
far
edge
of
that
sidewalk
leaving
ample
access
for
--
ample
room
for
ingress
and
egress
to
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
not
in
the
record
sir,
no
sir.
we
think
that
this
case
and
logan
valley
come
down
to
the
same
thing.
on
the
one
side,
we
have
property
which
is
open
to
the
public.
we
have
employees
who
seek
to
make
a
labor
appeal.
they
want
to
make
it
on
that
open
property
and
they
want
to
make
it
at
the
natural
and
effective
place.
and
on
the
other
side,
you
have
nothing
again,
but
naked
title.
on
that
equation,
this
court
in
logan
valley
said
the
first
amendment
right
prevails
and
i
think
it
prevails
in
this
case
too.
now
with
respect
to
this
preemption
question
in
this
case,
this
court
said
in
its
horn
buffalo
at
the
present
time
when
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
section
8
of
the
act,
the
state
says
as
well
as
the
federal
courts
must
defer
to
the
exclusive
competence
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
if
the
danger
of
state
interference
with
national
policy
is
to
be
averted.
not
clearly
we
have
in
this
case
conduct
which
is
surely
arguably
protective
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
primary
picketing
in
support
of
a
primary
strike
is
arguably
protected.
indeed,
it
cannot
be
arguably
said
to
be
anything
but
protected.
now,
does
it
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
preempted
character
of
a
controversy
that
it
can
--
it
takes
place
on
private
but
open
property,
the
board
day
in
and
day
out
must
decide
and
does
decide
just
these
very
questions
when
does
private
property
yield
to
the
realization
of
a
section
7
right.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
conflict
--
the
very
conflict
that
garmon
seeks
to
avoid
can
no
better
be
illustrated
by
reading
to
you
what
the
order
of
the
board
was
in
a
case
called
fashion
fair
inc.
which
is
on
page
253
of
our
reply
brief.
employees
were
discharged
by
an
employer.
they
picketed
in
front
of
his
premises.
his
premises
were
located
in
a
shopping
center
with
two
or
three
other
stores.
the
employer
evicted
those
employees
from
the
premises
and
the
nlrb
said
that
was
an
(8)
(a)
(1)
violation
and
this
is
the
order
it
entered.
cease
and
desist
from
ordering
employees
to
leave
public
or
quasi
public
areas
where
they
are
lawfully
engaged
in
peaceful
picketing
of
the
employer's
premises
or
in
other
lawful
concerted
activity.
the
power
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
complaint
with
respect
to
his
getting
the
question
before
the
board.
he
could
get
it
before
the
board
for
example
simply
by
asking
those
pickets
to
leave.
that
is
enough
for
us
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
board
and
to
get
the
controversy
there.
we
have
no
objection
to
raising
the
question
in
that
fashion
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
he
asked
us
to
leave
and
nothing
else
was
done
and
we
still
were
that,
presumably
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
depends
on
individual
situations.
if
you
got
--
if
you
want
to
avoid
a
physical
encounter,
you
leave
obviously.
mr.
bernard
dunau
must
take
action
adverse
to
our
exercise
of
handbilling
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
no
case
does
anyone
ever
go
to
a
court
until
he
first
asks
the
people
to
get
off
his
premises.
in
fact
that
the
requirement
that
you
get
off
with
the
condition
precedent
to
any
state
trespass
suit.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
alright,
and
he
does.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
but
that's
the
way
these
questions
get
before
all
the
time.
this
is
no
isolated
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
that's
the
way
the
question
gets
before
the
board
--
activity
by
the
employer
adverse
to
a
section
7
right
which
makes
it
possible
complain
there's
an
interference,
yes
sir
and
therefore,
there's
got
to
be
some
overt
activity.
for
us,
it's
sufficient
over
an
activity
to
be
asked
to
leave
the
public
place.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
dunau
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
just
want
to
address
it
to
the
specific
injunction.
we
would
be
entitled
even
on
assumption
of
obstructive
picketing
to
the
elimination
of
that
part
of
the
injunction
which
prohibits
trespassing
upon
the
property
of
weinacker's,
because
the
obstructive
picketing
would
authorize
only
in
an
injunction
reaching
the
obstruction,
not
the
elimination
of
picketing.
now
there
is
a
further
provision
in
the
injunction
which
says
that
“interfering
with
weinacher's
property
and
right
of
ingress
and
egress
to
the
property
and
place
of
business.”
if
that
means
physical
obstruction,
that
part
of
the
injunction
would
stand
if
the
finding
stands.
i
am
not
sure
how
to
read
that
part
of
the
injunction.
it's
imprecise
and
i
think
fatally
imprecise
with
respect
to
the
regulation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
for
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir.
so
that
we
are
taking
the
findings
as
they
now
are,
that
is
that
there
was
obstructive
picketing.
if
we
are
correct
on
our
general
proposition,
trespassing
upon
property
goes
out
and
the
injunction
must
be
tailored
to
fit
the
obstructive
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
tried,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
maps
used
which
are
in
the
petitioner's
or
respondent's
brief
to
pinpoint
where
the
property
is.
now,
if
you
look
on
a38.
mr.
bernard
dunau
a38
of
respondent's
brief
and
at
the
top
of
that
page,
you
will
see
governmen
street
running
somewhat
diagonally
across
that
top
of
the
page
and
there
is
a
number
246.
it's
within
that
area
of
246
that
the
store
appears,
as
you
will
note
the
government
street,
catherine
street
and
246.
mr.
bernard
dunau
catherine
street
and
government
street.
it's
248
at
the
right
margin
of
the
page,
if
one
works
inward
from
248
you'll
find
the
location
of
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir,
it
faces
on
government
street
and
it
--
faces
on
government
and
catherine
streets,
and
it's
at
the
top
of
that
page.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
not
suburban,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
can
be
put
in
a
nutshell.
picketing
takes
place
in
front
of
a
store
to
support
a
strike
by
that
store's
employees
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
picketing
is
prohibited
by
a
state
injunction
as
a
trespass
because
it
takes
place
on
a
sidewalk
which
is
publicly
used,
is
privately
owned.
we
have
three
questions.
first,
does
the
prohibition
violate
the
first
amendment?
second,
is
the
controversy
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
because
the
subject
matter
is
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board?
third,
if
the
state
court
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
does
the
prohibition
conflict
with
the
federally
protected
right
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act
to
engage
--
of
a
national
labor
relations
act,
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection?
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
situation
is
in
a
nutshell,
the
questions
proliferate.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
sir
our
primary
position
is
that
this
controversy
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
logan
valley.
mr.
bernard
dunau
logan
valley
your
honor,
amalgamated
food
employees
v.
logan
valley
plaza.
the
store
which
was
picketed
is
located
in
mobile,
alabama.
it
sold
dry
goods,
groceries,
drugs,
other
merchandise.
the
store
building
is
surrounded
by
a
private
sidewalk
publicly
used.
the
sidewalk
is
surrounded
by
a
parking
lot
privately
owned,
but
publicly
used.
the
parking
lot
is
surrounded
by
public
streets.
there
are
seven
automobile
entrances
into
this
parking
lot.
the
distance
from
the
nearest
automobile
entrance
to
the
picketed
area
is
a
115
feet.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
can't
say.
the
record
does
not
--
those
who
enter
park
free,
there
is
no
showing
that
there's
any
charge
for
parking
on
that
lot.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct.
there
is
no
showing
of
restriction
to
any
element
of
the
public.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
do
not
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
the
question
whether
when
you
have
a
public
situs,
you
may
have
picketing
or
other
demonstrations
or
other
exercise
of
free
speech
with
respect
to
a
matter
not
connected
with
that
situs.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
protesters
related
to
the
operation
of
a
shopping
center
and
therefore
we
do
not
have
to
and
we
should
not
reach
in
this
case
the
question
whether
when
the
situs
is
public,
but
the
protest
relates
to
a
matter
other
than
the
situs,
whether
the
locus
is
appropriate
for
the
expression
of
pre-amendment
rights.
the
second
circuit
has
decided
that
it
was.
i
believe
the
california
supreme
court
has
also
decided
that
it
makes
no
difference,
but
we
do
not
have
that
question
in
this
case.
the
story
here
begins
on
december
19,
1963.
the
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
be
certified
as
the
representative
of
the
store's
employees.
on
april
16,
1964
the
union
was
certified
as
the
representative.
in
august
and
september
of
1964,
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
issued
alleging
massive
unfair
labor
practices
including
nine
discriminatory
discharges
of
a
group
of
40
or
50
employees
and
the
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
on
june
25,
1965,
the
nlrb
issued
a
decision
affirming,
sustaining
the
complaint
in
full.
on
january
28,
1966,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
summarily
enforced
the
nlrb's
order.
meanwhile,
on
december
12,
1964,
a
strike
of
a
store
employees
was
begun.
negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
had
broken
down.
on
january
22,
1965,
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
sought
and
obtained,
restraining
the
picketing,
enjoining
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
store
as
a
trespass.
that
ex
parte
injunction
was
continued
on
march
26,
1965
after
a
non-evidentiary
hearing.
on
april
9,
an
appeal
was
taken,
in
1965
on
november
10,
the
appeal
was
argued
and
submitted.
on
september
19,
1968,
three-and-a-half
years
after
the
appeal
was
taken
and
three
years
after
it
was
argued,
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
that
the
injunction
should
be
affirmed.
it
said
that
the
controversy
was
not
preempted
to
the
labor
board.
the
injunction
did
not
prohibit
section
7
rights
and
it
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
the
record
is
silent
with
respect
to
the
reason
for
the
delay.
meanwhile,
on
may
20,
1968,
four
months
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
decided
this
case,
this
court
decided
amalgamated
food
employees
v.
logan
valley
plaza.
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
peaceful
picketing
and
handbilling
could
not
be
prohibited
within
a
shopping
center
on
the
ground
that
the
shopping
center
grounds
were
owned
privately.
we
think
there
is
no
distinction
between
logan
valley
and
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
only
two
orders
was
the
ex
parte
injunction
and
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
at
that
time,
it
was
a
temporary
injunction.
then
on
--
two
months
later,
it
was
continued
until
further
modification
in
accordance
with
due
process
of
law.
in
other
words,
from
the
non-evidentiary
hearing,
two
months
later,
the
injunction
was
to
continue
indefinitely
unless
terminated
or
modified
by
the
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know
how
one
would
characterize
an
injunction
which
is
to
continue
indefinitely.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
did
not.
it's
the
identical
injunction
that
was
before
this
court
in
logan
valley.
it
terminated
all
federal
questions.
there
is
nothing
that
meet
and
can
go
back
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
with
respect
to
any
federal
question,
in
addition
since
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
preemption
presented
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
injunction
would
be
termed
final
within
this
court's
meaning
of
that
term,
would
not
make
any
difference
because
with
respect
to
a
preempted
question,
we
can
get
here
on
a
temporary
as
well
as
a
permanent
injunction,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
this
injunction
is
final.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
i
don't
say
that
the
rule
that
there
must
be
a
final
judgment
as
eliminated,
but
the
final
judgment
rule
is
satisfied
in
a
case
of
preemption
by
an
order
which
is
in
the
form
of
temporary.
that
meets
the
final
judgment
rule
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
it's
in
the
brief
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
underlying
labor
dispute
has
long
been
there
your
honor.
what
remains
now
is
that
the
injunction
still
is
operative
to
preclude
any
picketing
on
those
grounds
whether
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
strike
of
the
stores
which
are
presently
operating
or
in
furtherance
of
organizational
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
particular
labor
dispute
which
gave
rise
to
this
controversy
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
the
particular
controversy
is
that
the
injunction
is
very
much
alive
and
is
available
at
any
time
that
the
union
or
another
labor
organization
or
employees
would
seek
to
resume
picketing
within
the
grounds
of
this
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
same
--
well,
there
has
been
since
the
certification
a
change
in
ownership
so
that
the
store
which
was
originally
involved
has
now
instead
of
operating
the
store
has
leased
its
premises
to
two
others.
whether
that
lease
of
the
premises
and
the
change
of
ownership
has
affected
the
nlrb
certification
is
itself
a
substantial
question,
but
the
labor
organization
has
stuck
--
it
still
exists
and
it
still
represents
employees
in
this
general
locale
and
is
still
certainly
available
to
resume
organization
or
other
picketing
with
respect
to
the
stores
which
are
now
within
that
shopping
center.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
are
available
at
any
time
to
start
organizing
the
employees
within
the
two
stores
that
are
now
occupying
these
premises
and
the
injunction
as
it
presently
operates
would
preclude
entry
upon
those
premises
in
order
to
picket
in
furtherance
of
any
dispute
with
those
two
stores.
so
that
the
injunction
continues
at
the
present
time
to
be
fully
operative
to
bar
the
union
or
representatives
of
the
union
or
employees
from
picketing
at
the
entrance
of
either
of
the
stores
which
are
presently
occupying
the
premises.
the
injunction
reads
flatly,
prohibits
trespassing
upon
weinacker's
property.
it
remains
weinacker's
property.
there
are
stores
functioning
on
weinacker's
property
at
any
time
when
it
becomes
appropriate
to
picket
those
stores
or
to
handbill
those
stores,
this
injunction
precludes
entry
into
the
property
for
that
purpose,
so
we
have
a
--
continue
to
have
a
live
controversy.
i
said
that
in
our
view,
logan
valley
controls
this
case.
the
essence
of
logan
valley
as
we
see
it
is
that
when
an
employer
opens
his
property
to
the
public,
to
customers
in
order
to
come
to
this
store
to
buy,
to
others
in
the
community
in
order
to
operate
his
store
that
employer
cannot
close
that
property
to
employees
and
seek
to
publicize
the
store's
disfavored
labor
policy.
the
only
difference
between
logan
valley
and
this
case
is
that
the
real
estate
here
is
smaller
than
it
was
in
logan
valley.
in
logan
valley,
the
distances
from
the
public
entrances
to
the
picketed
area
were
from
350
feet
to
400
and
500
feet.
in
this
case,
the
distances
are
115
feet
to
385
feet.
in
a
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
which
following
logan
valley,
the
court
said
--
the
california
supreme
court
said
with
respect
to
a
single
shop
owner
that
logan
valley
requires
that
picketing
--
that
handbilling
be
permitted
on
the
private
sidewalk
serving
that
individual
store
owner
because
the
sidewalk
was
publicly
used.
the
distances
were
150
feet
to
280
feet.
we
do
not
think
that
the
appropriateness
of
the
property
as
a
place
for
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
a
dispute
which
relates
to
the
operation
on
that
property
can
be
sized
by
whether
it's
350
feet,
400,
500
feet,
150
feet,
280
feet
or
whatever
the
distances
may
be.
to
us,
it
seems
that
the
only
viable
standard
can
be
the
openness
of
a
property
to
a
public
entry.
once
it's
open,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
distances
which
are
open
are
115
feet
or
400
to
500
feet.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it
seem
to
say
not
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
shopping
center,
but
that
it
involves
a
smaller
shopping
center.
at
the
time,
it
affirmed
the
injunction,
it
had
only
one
store
operating.
so
that
there
is
of
course
a
clear
distinction
between
a
one
store
operation
and
a
shopping
center
which
has
more
than
one
store,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
have
any
relevance
at
any
time
whether
one
owner
opens
a
property
or
several
owners
opened
the
property
could
hardly
make
a
difference.
at
the
present
time,
there
are
in
fact
two
stores
operating
on
that
property
so
we
have
a
shopping
center
in
almost
the
most
colloquial
notion
of
that
term.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
but
we
need
to
remember
that
insofar
as
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned,
in
logan
valley,
the
action
was
brought
both
by
the
lessor
and
by
the
store
operator
and
no
one
ever
suggested
that
the
lessor
did
not
have
an
adequate
interest
to
preclude
entry
upon
that
property.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
not
suburban,
it's
downtown
mobile
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
we
make
no
such
claim.
the
right
of
picketing
extends
as
it
would
where
the
store
to
front
on
a
public
street,
to
the
immediate
entrance
to
that
store
leaving
ample
room
for
ingress
and
egress
to
the
store.
we
make
no
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
be
inside
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
assuming
you
have
stands
which
are
open
rather
than
stores
which
have
cover
on
them,
i
see
no
difference.
there
have
to
be
public
ways
to
get
to
those
places
within
the
shopping
area.
so
long
as
they're
all
public
ways
and
there
is
a
public
way
in
front
of
a
particular
stand
that
you
have
a
dispute
with,
it
would
be
our
position
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
go
in
front
of
that
open
stand
so
long
as
it
is
open
property.
and
it
would
necessarily
have
to
be
because
there
is
no
other
way
for
a
customer
to
reach
that
stand
to
buy
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
think
they're
all
part
of
the
same
package
with
respect
to
a
shopping
center
your
honor.
the
window
shopper
is
a
potential
customer
and
you
would
just
soon
have
them
in
there
taking
to
look
at
what
you
have
in
your
windows
and
ultimately,
he's
going
to
get
into
that
store.
it's
the
openness
of
the
property.
the
very
fact
as
the
federation
in
its
amicus
brief
put
it
with
respect
to
the
character
of
all
stores
which
have
private
property
on
which
they
front
but
that
private
property
is
intended
for
use
to
enable
the
customer
to
come.
it
put
it
this
way
in
its
amicus
brief.
smaller,
such
retail
establishments
have
in
common
with
large
shopping
centers,
a
desire
to
maximize
the
accessibility
of
the
public
to
their
premises.
it
is
an
integral
component
of
every
retail
business
that
it
be
freely
open
to
the
public.
and
therefore,
our
position
that
whether
the
open
property
happens
to
be
smaller
or
larger
cannot
by
the
criterion
so
long
as
it's
open,
then
it
has
to
be
open
to
employees
to
publicize
that
this
labor
policy
of
a
particular
employer
operating
within
that
real
estate.
now,
in
this
case,
i
think
this
is
particularly
plain
because
here,
we
have
employees
of
that
very
store
who
want
to
picket
or
handbill
and
are
barred
from
those
very
premises.
now,
when
they're
working
for
that
store,
they
are
parking
their
car
on
that
parking
lot.
they're
using
those
walkways
and
they're
entering
the
same
entrance
in
order
to
get
to
work.
now,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
those
employees
when
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
employment
terms
become
trespassers
instead
of
invitees
when
they
park
their
car
on
that
same
parking
lot,
walk
those
same
walkways,
but
this
time
picket
in
front
of
the
store.
you
don't
become
an
--
or
trespasser
rather
than
an
invitee
when
you
change
from
a
working
employee
to
a
striking
employee.
now,
we're
told
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
picketing
is
more
than
speech.
sure,
it's
more
than
speech,
but
it
was
more
than
speech
in
logan
valley
as
well.
and
more
than
speech
means
only
that
the
patrol
in
front
of
the
store
may
be
regulated
with
respect
to
the
number
of
pickets.
if
there
are
too
many
there
or
if
they
are
too
close
to
the
doorway
and
interfere
with
ingress
and
egress,
then
you
tell
them
to
get
away
from
the
doorway
and
picket
on
the
far
side
of
the
sidewalk,
that's
what
we
mean
by
regulation
of
the
plus
aspect
of
picketing.
we
do
not
mean
that
you
can
ban
it
all
together
from
an
otherwise
appropriate
open
place.
it's
suggested
in
this
case
that
there
was
actually
obstructed
picketing.
we'll
pass
the
question
whether
on
this
record,
it
is
possible
for
anyone
to
say
there
was
obstructed
picketing.
there
was
six
identically
worded
affidavits
which
said
there
was
obstructed
picketing.
there
was
an
answer
filed
by
the
union
which
said
there
was
no
obstructed
picketing
sworn
to
by
two
officers
of
the
union.
i
do
not
know
how
as
between
six
paper
swearers
on
the
one
side
and
two
paper
swearers
on
the
other
one
can
ever
find
a
fact
one
way
or
the
other.
you
need
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
suppose,
suppose
there
was
obstructive
picketing
in
this
case,
all
that
that
would
authorize
would
be
the
elimination
of
the
obstruction
and
not
the
elimination
of
picketing
and
that's
the
point
of
this
case
here.
the
court
says
the
alabama
supreme
court,
it
doesn't
look
to
us
as
if
the
picketing
at
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
would
a
materially
less
effective
than
the
picketing
in
front
of
the
store.
our
fundamental
answer
is
that's
the
wrong
question.
if
a
place
is
otherwise
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
free
speech
rights,
that
place
does
not
become
inappropriate
because
there
are
other
places
as
well
that
one
can
exercise
free
speech
rights.
but
if
one
is
to
look
to
comparative
effectiveness,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
picketing
and
handbilling
cannot
possibly
be
nearly
as
effective
at
the
entrance
to
the
parking
lot
as
it
is
in
front
of
a
store.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
handbilling;
i
don't
care
how
slowly
a
car
moves
from
a
public
street
through
an
entrance
into
a
parking
lot,
it's
still
moving
and
you
cannot
very
well
distribute
handbills
to
a
moving
vehicle
and
you
sure
can't
distribute
handbills
to
a
moving
vehicle
on
a
cold
day
when
those
windows
are
uptight
and
no
one
is
lowering
windows
to
receive
handbills
on
a
cold
day
and
once
those
people
are
in
the
parking
lot,
you
can't
get
to
them
to
distribute
handbills.
so
handbill
distribution
is
very
much
enfeebled
by
this
kind
of
an
injunction.
take
picketing
itself;
again,
when
you're
driving
a
car
through
an
entrance
into
a
parking
lot,
you're
not
paying
much
attention
to
pickets
or
what's
said
on
the
sign.
when
you
park
that
car
and
you're
moving
to
the
store,
those
pickets
are
on
back
of
you.
when
you
get
to
the
entrance,
there
is
no
message.
we
want
the
message
at
the
place
that
means
something
--
at
the
entrance
to
the
store.
now,
it's
perfectly
clear,
the
union
strenuously
wants
to
get
into
these
premises.
the
employer
strenuously
wants
to
keep
us
out.
neither
the
union
nor
the
employer
are
engaging
in
abstractions
with
respect
to
the
philosophical
reach
of
free
speech.
we
want
in
because
that's
where
the
picketing
and
handbilling
is
effective
and
the
employer
wants
us
out
for
the
same
reason
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
obvious.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
--
well,
not
in
the
record
sir
but
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
appended
a
diagram
of
the
property
and
there
are
like
diagrams
in
the
appendices
to
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
there
is
no
difference
with
respect
to
the
diagrams.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
they
say
ours
is
indecipherable.
i
think
theirs
is,
but
i
don't
think
either
of
us
claim
that
the
others
are
inaccurate
and
there
is
a
slight
difference
with
respect
to
how
many
feet
from
the
picketing
area
to
the
entrance.
but
that
depends
on
where
you
are
measuring
prominent,
what
terminal
point.
there
is
no
difference
in
the
accuracy
of
either
diagram.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
the
picketing
was
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
to
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
may
or
i'm
not
sure
now
whether
the
record
shows
whether
there
was
an
overhanging
porch.
there
may
or
may
not
have
been.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
are
--
in
this
shopping
center,
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there
is
a
particular
pickup
zone.
so
far
as
it
appears,
the
customer
still
simply
walks
out
of
the
store
and
goes
to
wherever
he
has
parked
his
car.
there
is
no
showing
of
a
pick
up
zone
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
picketing
was
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
store.
according
to
one
set
of
affidavits,
it
was
so
close
to
the
store
entrance
that
it
obstructed
ingress
and
egress.
according
to
our
version
of
it,
it
was
sufficiently
removed
so
it
did
not
obstruct
ingress
and
egress.
we
would
take
the
position
with
respect
to
that
matter
that
the
side
--
there
was
an
available
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
store
and
we
were
surely
entitled
to
picket
on
the
far
edge
of
that
sidewalk
leaving
ample
access
for
--
ample
room
for
ingress
and
egress
to
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
not
in
the
record
sir,
no
sir.
we
think
that
this
case
and
logan
valley
come
down
to
the
same
thing.
on
the
one
side,
we
have
property
which
is
open
to
the
public.
we
have
employees
who
seek
to
make
a
labor
appeal.
they
want
to
make
it
on
that
open
property
and
they
want
to
make
it
at
the
natural
and
effective
place.
and
on
the
other
side,
you
have
nothing
again,
but
naked
title.
on
that
equation,
this
court
in
logan
valley
said
the
first
amendment
right
prevails
and
i
think
it
prevails
in
this
case
too.
now
with
respect
to
this
preemption
question
in
this
case,
this
court
said
in
its
horn
buffalo
at
the
present
time
when
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
section
8
of
the
act,
the
state
says
as
well
as
the
federal
courts
must
defer
to
the
exclusive
competence
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
if
the
danger
of
state
interference
with
national
policy
is
to
be
averted.
not
clearly
we
have
in
this
case
conduct
which
is
surely
arguably
protective
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
primary
picketing
in
support
of
a
primary
strike
is
arguably
protected.
indeed,
it
cannot
be
arguably
said
to
be
anything
but
protected.
now,
does
it
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
preempted
character
of
a
controversy
that
it
can
--
it
takes
place
on
private
but
open
property,
the
board
day
in
and
day
out
must
decide
and
does
decide
just
these
very
questions
when
does
private
property
yield
to
the
realization
of
a
section
7
right.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
conflict
--
the
very
conflict
that
garmon
seeks
to
avoid
can
no
better
be
illustrated
by
reading
to
you
what
the
order
of
the
board
was
in
a
case
called
fashion
fair
inc.
which
is
on
page
253
of
our
reply
brief.
employees
were
discharged
by
an
employer.
they
picketed
in
front
of
his
premises.
his
premises
were
located
in
a
shopping
center
with
two
or
three
other
stores.
the
employer
evicted
those
employees
from
the
premises
and
the
nlrb
said
that
was
an
(8)
(a)
(1)
violation
and
this
is
the
order
it
entered.
cease
and
desist
from
ordering
employees
to
leave
public
or
quasi
public
areas
where
they
are
lawfully
engaged
in
peaceful
picketing
of
the
employer's
premises
or
in
other
lawful
concerted
activity.
the
power
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
have
no
complaint
with
respect
to
his
getting
the
question
before
the
board.
he
could
get
it
before
the
board
for
example
simply
by
asking
those
pickets
to
leave.
that
is
enough
for
us
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
board
and
to
get
the
controversy
there.
we
have
no
objection
to
raising
the
question
in
that
fashion
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
he
asked
us
to
leave
and
nothing
else
was
done
and
we
still
were
that,
presumably
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
depends
on
individual
situations.
if
you
got
--
if
you
want
to
avoid
a
physical
encounter,
you
leave
obviously.
mr.
bernard
dunau
must
take
action
adverse
to
our
exercise
of
handbilling
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
no
case
does
anyone
ever
go
to
a
court
until
he
first
asks
the
people
to
get
off
his
premises.
in
fact
that
the
requirement
that
you
get
off
with
the
condition
precedent
to
any
state
trespass
suit.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
alright,
and
he
does.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
but
that's
the
way
these
questions
get
before
all
the
time.
this
is
no
isolated
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
that's
the
way
the
question
gets
before
the
board
--
activity
by
the
employer
adverse
to
a
section
7
right
which
makes
it
possible
complain
there's
an
interference,
yes
sir
and
therefore,
there's
got
to
be
some
overt
activity.
for
us,
it's
sufficient
over
an
activity
to
be
asked
to
leave
the
public
place.
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
dunau
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
just
want
to
address
it
to
the
specific
injunction.
we
would
be
entitled
even
on
assumption
of
obstructive
picketing
to
the
elimination
of
that
part
of
the
injunction
which
prohibits
trespassing
upon
the
property
of
weinacker's,
because
the
obstructive
picketing
would
authorize
only
in
an
injunction
reaching
the
obstruction,
not
the
elimination
of
picketing.
now
there
is
a
further
provision
in
the
injunction
which
says
that
“interfering
with
weinacher's
property
and
right
of
ingress
and
egress
to
the
property
and
place
of
business.”
if
that
means
physical
obstruction,
that
part
of
the
injunction
would
stand
if
the
finding
stands.
i
am
not
sure
how
to
read
that
part
of
the
injunction.
it's
imprecise
and
i
think
fatally
imprecise
with
respect
to
the
regulation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
for
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir.
so
that
we
are
taking
the
findings
as
they
now
are,
that
is
that
there
was
obstructive
picketing.
if
we
are
correct
on
our
general
proposition,
trespassing
upon
property
goes
out
and
the
injunction
must
be
tailored
to
fit
the
obstructive
picketing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
have
tried,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
maps
used
which
are
in
the
petitioner's
or
respondent's
brief
to
pinpoint
where
the
property
is.
now,
if
you
look
on
a38.
mr.
bernard
dunau
a38
of
respondent's
brief
and
at
the
top
of
that
page,
you
will
see
governmen
street
running
somewhat
diagonally
across
that
top
of
the
page
and
there
is
a
number
246.
it's
within
that
area
of
246
that
the
store
appears,
as
you
will
note
the
government
street,
catherine
street
and
246.
mr.
bernard
dunau
catherine
street
and
government
street.
it's
248
at
the
right
margin
of
the
page,
if
one
works
inward
from
248
you'll
find
the
location
of
the
store.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir,
it
faces
on
government
street
and
it
--
faces
on
government
and
catherine
streets,
and
it's
at
the
top
of
that
page.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
not
suburban,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir
that's
correct.
