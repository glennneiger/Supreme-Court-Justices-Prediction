mr.
dunau,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
what
you
may
have
in
mind
is
that
it's
a
nutshell
we've
looked
at
before
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
group
of
people
wanted
to
have
a
demonstration
let
us
say
in
favor
of
the
vietnam
war
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
hold
it
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
you
say
in
the
general
locale.
how
about
right
within
the
particular
store
that
was
the
subject
to
this
controversy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
--
i
suppose
you
would
not
contend
that
the
right
of
picketing
extended
to
the
inside
of
the
store?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
instead
of
using
the
open
area
as
a
parking
lot,
the
store
undertook
as
they
do
in
some
parts
of
the
world
to
setup
booths
and
shops
and
tables
out
through
the
parking
area
and
had
an
open
air
shop?
would
you
then
think
the
parking
area
had
become
like
you
--
as
you
now
concede
the
inside
of
the
store
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
difference
in
the
standing
invitation
to
the
public
to
use
the
parking
lot
and
the
sidewalks
or
the
standing
invitation
of
the
public
to
come
in
and
look
around
and
shop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dunau.
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
private
property
asserts
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
were
using
a
soundtrack
as
advertisers
sometimes
do,
or
candidates
for
political
office
sometimes
do,
they
might
not
be
free
to
do
that
at
3
o'clock
in
the
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
assuming
a
case
where
it's
permitted,
it
might
not
be
permitted
to
3
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
concede,
i
take
it,
that
the
message
gets
through
better
in
the
private
sidewalk
right
in
front
of
the
door?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
still
better
if
it's
inside
the
store
perhaps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

minutes.
