how
was
that
the
employer
ever
gets
a
question
before
the
board
except
by
eviction?
justice
byron

would
you
raise
it
if
he
just
asked
you
to
leave
and
--
would
you
then
file
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
leave?
i
gather
you
wouldn't?
justice
byron

white
but
if
he
really
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
board
--
if
this
was
protected,
if
this
arguably
protected,
i'd
like
to
find
out
what
it
is
about.
the
only
way
to
really
cure
that
i
suppose
would
be
to
evict
you
from
the

so
indeed
must
use
self
help
better
than
the
courts
in

to
insure
duty

--
before
the
board.

that
isn't
my

would
have

then
you
don't
leave.

then
you
don't
leave,
what
does
he
do
then?
he
must
evict
you
in

to
be
--
justice

--
that
the
question
gets
before
the

alright,
i
was
just
wondering
as
to
--
justice

you
could
have
removed
them.
justice

and
the
picketing
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
about
the
union,
doesn't
it?
justice

whether
it's
violent
or
otherwise?
justice

well
i
know
would
do.
justice
byron

white
what
if
there
was
mass
picketing
or
obstructive
picketing?
does
the
employer
have
a
remedy
before
the
