justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
effect
if
the
--
your
adversary
win
in
connection
with
this
increase
valuation?
will
it
have
on
the
operation
of
the
new
railroad
that
has
been
created
by
this
proceedings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
any
effect
in
increasing
the
value
of
the
stock
on
which
the
public
must
pay
rates?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i'm
correct.
how
could
you
avoid
it?
maybe
it
can
but
how
could
it
avoid
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
consideration
is
he
has
railroad
that's
going
to
be
running.
these
people
have
litigation
here
with
a
division
of
some
money
suppose
to
be
a
part
of
the
value
and
the
stock
they
had.
what
effect
does
that
that
going
to
have
if
the
public
has
to
pay
rates
on
the
value
of
the
property?
what
effect
do
that
have
on
the
payment
of
rate,
if
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
be
a
hundred
--
millions
that
you
said
that
litigations
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
potentially
it
is
true.
i'm
just
asking
because
i
haven't
heard
yet
anyone
making
a
direct
positive
statement
that
what's
involved
in
this
lawsuit
and
what
it
mean
to
the
railroad
and
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
will
it
going
to
the
railroad
value?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
result
of
this
litigation
if
you
went
on
the
other
side
when
it
show
of
in
the
operating
cause
of
the
railroad
because
of
the
investment
in
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
it
possible?
if
you
say
it's
possible
then
how
is
it
possible
and
not
probable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
pay
something
with
the
issue
if
it's
not
out
of
the
railroad,
who
would
it
come
from?
you
don't
handle
with
millions
this
way
without
it
affecting
something
is
in
norm.
i'm
simply
asking
to
about
what
happen?
maybe
it's
not
material,
i
had
an
idea.
i
would
like
to
know
something
about
what's
going
to
happen?
if
we
decided
in
your
favor
or
if
we
decided
in
favor
of
the
other
side,
are
merely
adjusting
an
amount
of
money
as
between
the
bondholders
and
somebody
else
or
are
we
adjusting
it
on
a
basis
that
will
affect
the
future
operation
of
this
railroad
with
the
regard
to
its
investment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
increase
it
wouldn't
it
a
$100
million?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can.
you
say
quite
likely.
it
increases
somebody
as
over
a
$100
million
if
your
adversaries
win,
i
understand.
whose
target
does
that
going
into?
justice
thurgood
marshall
penn
central
railroad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
why
wouldn't
it?
why
do
you
say
should?
how
can
you
avoid
it?
i
haven't
understood
it
fully
but
at
least
no
one
has
mentioned
that
part
that
plays
the
case
at
least
in
the
way
that
i
could
understand
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words
then
you
think
it's
going
to
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
you
asked
one
question?
it
may
not
be
relevant.
it
may
not
be
material.
as
i
understand
it’s
different
where
the
bondholders
would
get
but
some
$100
million
or
$125
million
more
than
the
commission
allotted
if
that’s
right
on
the
bond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
whatever
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
from
whose
pocket
does
that
come?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
where
the
litigation
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
real
issue
is
between
the
bondholders
who
claim
a
certain
amount
as
penn
central
which
claims
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
litigation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
the
same
rate
base?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
that
the
public
may
be
given
at
least
in
another
way
by
having
the
stocks
on
sales
to
the
workman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
one
question

that?
justice
