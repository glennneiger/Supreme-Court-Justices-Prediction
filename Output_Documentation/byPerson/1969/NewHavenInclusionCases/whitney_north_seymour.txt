mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
thank
you
sir.
i
am
going
to
open
for
the
appellants
on
our
side.
i
represent
the
trustee
manufacturers
hanover
trust
company
under
the
represent
the
first
mortgage
bonds.
i
will
be
followed
by
mr.
migdal
who
represents
the
bond
holders
committee
and
he
will
be
followed
mr.
auerbach
who
represents
the
trustee.
a
little
later
on,
i'll
explain
the
division
of
argument
after
i've
gotten
started.
the
bonds
outstanding
of
this
railroad
consist
of
$76
million
of
first
mortgage
bonds
with
about
$24
million
of
accrued
interest,
and
$53
million
of
second
mortgage
bonds.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
harlem
river
divisional
bond
will
be
paid
off
so
that
there
is
only
a
permanent
two
classes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
court
already
has
some
familiarity
with
these
matters
in
the
penn-central
merger
case,
the
inclusion
report
of
the
commission,
which
i
will
have
occasionally,
refer
to
was
before
the
court
at
the
time
it
decided
the
penn-central
merger
case.
the
new
haven
filed
a
petition
for
reorganization
in
the
connecticut
district
court
in
1961
and
that
reorganization
has
continued
since.
judge
robert
anderson
was
in
charge
of
the
reorganization
from
the
beginning
and
continued
to
be
after
his
appointment
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
--
and
is
a
somewhat
unusual
type
of
reorganization
from
the
very
beginning
because
the
railroad
had
been
running
deficit
since
at
least
1956.
it
was
apparent
that
the
only
way
to
keep
the
railroad
running
was
to
have
some
kind
of
a
merger
or
sale
to
another
railroad
in
existence.
and
during
the
time
of
reorganization,
that
is
from
1961
down
through
the
1968
at
which
time
the
penn
central
took
over
the
new
haven
and
paid
over
the
considerations
subject
to
review
of
the
problem
of
price.
the
reorganization
had
accumulated
some
$65
million
of
charges
and
claims
ahead
of
the
bonds
as
a
result
of
reorganization
expenses
and
borrowings
and
so
on.
this
process
continued,
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
because
of
the
determination
on
the
part
of
a
judge
and
the
trustees
and
the
trustees’
counsel
and
the
commission
to
keep
the
railroad
running
and
a
proper
feeling
on
the
part
of
judge
anderson
and
the
others
that
new
england
required
the
continuation
of
this
railroad.
i
think
your
honors
are
familiar
enough
with
its
physical
circumstances,
so
that
help
me
to
go
into
those
that
runs
from
massachusetts,
rhode
island,
connecticut
and
new
york
and
these
both
are
a
railroad
which
takes
commuter
traffic
and
interstate
traffic
of
a
more
general
in
character.
it's
clear
i
think
that
from
the
very
beginning,
the
trustees
were
seeking
to
find
a
railroad
with
which
there
might
be
a
merger
of
the
new
haven
or
an
acquisition
of
the
new
haven
and
that
from
the
very
beginning
while
this
search
went
on,
there
was
no
prospect
that
the
road
could
have
been
abandoned
or
liquidated
because
of
the
concern
of
everyone
to
keep
it
running.
in
1961,
the
trustees
approached
the
pennsylvania
and
the
new
york
central
on
behalf
of
new
haven
to
see
if
they
were
interested
in
some
acquisition
and
in
1962,
they
reported
that
the
only
salvation
for
this
railroad
was
some
kind
of
a
merger
or
acquisition.
and
in
the
same
month,
march
1962,
the
pennsylvania
and
the
central
asked
approval
of
their
merger
under
section
52
of
the
commission.
in
june
1962,
the
trustees
intervened
in
the
merger
case
to
seek
inclusion.
there
were
negotiations
in
1964
between
penn
central
and
the
trustees
which
were
unknown
to
the
bondholders
and
which
ultimately
resulted
in
an
agreement
which
was
disposed
for
the
first
time
in
a
report
of
a
commission
examiner,
an
agreement
under
which
the
merged
corporation
would
acquire
the
new
haven
assets
for
certain
specified
considerations.
the
commission
approved
the
merger
and
required
penn
central
to
include
both
passenger
and
freight
operations
and
said
in
its
order,
“all
upon
such
fair
and
equitable
term
as
the
parties
may
agree
subject
to
the
approval
of
a
bankruptcy
court
and
the
commission.”
in
october
1966,
the
trustees
and
penn
central
filed
their
agreed
purchase
agreement
as
a
first
step
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
hearings
before
an
examiner
followed,
report
was
dispensed
with
and
the
matter
was
submitted
directly
to
the
commission.
for
some
intermediate
proceedings
and
in
which
arrangements
were
made
for
loans
to
the
new
haven
and
other
matters,
but
i
don’t
see
if
they’re
relevant
to
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
and
the
were
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
won’t
take
time
to
talk
about.
there
followed
the
inclusion
report
of
november
1967,
which
is
the
report
which
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
penn-central
merger,
at
least
this
court
knew
about
it.
that
report
led
to
the
first
round
of
these
appellants’
successful
applications
to
the
courts
below,
and
both
courts
below
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
essence
of
that
inclusion
report
as
far
as
the
new
haven
is
concerned
is
that
using
evaluation
as
the
evaluation
date,
december
31,
1966,
the
commission
found
net
liquidation
value
of
the
new
haven
assets
was
a
$128.9
million,
which
had
rounded
to
a
$125
million.
it
found
the
fair
value
of
the
consideration
to
be
paid
by
the
penn
central
under
the
purchase
agreement
was
a
$123.6
million
which
had
rounded
to
a
$125
million
so
that
the
consideration
and
the
value
of
the
liquidation
value
were
similar
and
because
of
that,
equality
which
it
saw
in
the
transaction
had
held
that
the
transaction
met
statutory
standards
and
approved
it
by
the
appellant.
the
present
appellants
petitioned
for
review
and
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
consisting
of
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet,
and
judge
weinfeld
from
the
southern
district.
by
order
of
may
1968,
the
court
disapproved
the
inclusion
report
on
the
ground
that
it
appeared
that
the
penn
central
should
pay
an
additional
sum
of
$45
to
$50
million.
i
don't
think
there's
any
use
in
going
into
the
items
there,
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
15
from
judge
winfield's
later
dissenting
opinion.
while
the
matter
was
pending
before
the
three-judge
court,
the
commission
submitted
the
purchase
agreement
to
the
reorganization
court
as
step
one
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
in
april
1968,
the
court
appointed
a
former
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
judge
john
van
voorhis
has
a
special
master
that
considered
the
problems
that
are
arising
out
of
the
grand
central
terminal
property.
we
don't
say
a
word
about
that
although
mr.
migdal
is
going
to
carry
the
argument
on
the
point
on
the
matter
that
it’s
still
open.
just
after
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
railroads
using
grand
central
terminal
came
down
a
great
open
ditch,
which
is
now
park
avenue
and
that
seemed
to
kind
of
a
waste
of
a
valuable
property.
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
it
was
bridged
over
to
create
park
avenue,
and
as
a
result
of
that
and
the
agreements
between
the
central
and
the
new
haven,
a
number
of
the
principal
hotels
at
which
we
have
all
to
few
left
were
built
the
waldorf,
the
biltmore,
the
commodore,
the
roosevelt,
the
pan-am
building
is
older
than
the
yale
club.
the
new
haven
and
penn
central
--
the
central
had
a
sort
of
a
partnership
interest
in
these
properties
and
there
was
dispute
about
the
nature
of
that
interest
and
its
value.
the
commission
in
its
inclusion
report
stuck
a
balance
between
various
possibilities
and
arrive
at
a
figure
of
$13
million
as
the
figure
that
should
be
allowed,
but
that
was
evidently
too
low
and
judge
van
voorhis
was
asked
to
report
his
views
about
the
legal
relationships.
and
he
upheld
the
view
that
there
was
a
partnership
interest
in
connection
with
the
grand
central
properties
and
ultimately
as
i
will
show
your
honors
in
the
remand
report
the
original
loss
of
$13
million
was
advanced
to
$28
million
so
that
under
the
present
position
of
the
commission,
the
new
haven
is
entitled
to
$28
million
for
its
interest.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
value
of
the
property
is
$227
million
so
that
the
penn
central
has
acquired
a
very
valuable
property
for
a
very
small
amount.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes.
because
of
his
background
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
he
was
thought
to
be
a
great
expert
in
the
new
york
property
problems
and
so
he
was
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
he
is
practicing
law
in
new
york.
the
reorganization
court
like
the
three-judge
court
concluded
that
the
allowance
by
the
commission
was
inadequate
that
the
undervalued
property
and
he
too
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
three-judge
court
thought
that
the
amount
the
commission
should
increase
its
determination
value
was
$45-50
million.
judge
van
voorhis
spread
was
a
little
wider.
he
thought
it
should
be
$33-55
million.
judge
anderson,
i
beg
your
pardon,
judge
anderson.
the
commission
proceeded
the
whole
expedited
hearings
and
made
its
remand
report
on
november
25,
1968
and
this
is
the
one
which
these
appellants
attacked
here,
and
so
i
will
be
talking
about
some
phases
of
that
a
little
later
on.
the
commission
was
sustained
on
some
matters
by
the
courts
later
on.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
take
any
time
on
that.
so
what
we
are
going
to
talk
about
on
our
side
are
those
things
where
the
commission
was
sustained
by
division
among
the
judges
and
those
things
where
the
commission
was
not
sustained
--
or
was
sustained
but
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
sustaining
it.
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
remand
was
starting
with
the
liquidation
value
of
a
$125
million,
which
the
court
had
found
for
a
$128
million
--
128.9,
which
the
commission
had
found
on
its
origin
inclusion
order
and
increasing
that
to
a
$162.7
million
and
then
immediately
retreated
by
a
series
of
deductions,
major
deductions
from
that
amount.
the
most
significant
and
those
to
which
i
am
going
to
address
myself
being
to
totaling
$22
million.
one
is
so
called
discount
for
a
abandonment
delay
and
the
other
discount
for
--
so
called
discount
for
bulk
sale.
and
in
both
this
cases,
our
position
is
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
who
dissented
below
were
correct
in
their
view
that
this
discounts
were
unjustified
and
that
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet
were
wrong
in
concluding
that
they
could
be
justified.
and
so
we
shall
ask
your
honors
to
follow
the
reorganization
court
on
these
matters.
our
order
to
about
what
they
were.
the
first
discount,
the
abandonment
delay
discount
or
as
in
the
substantial
figure
of
$15,386,000.00
and
this
was
based
upon
the
theory
that
beginning
in
1967,
the
new
haven
would
have
had
to
start
abandonment
proceeding
that
that
would
have
taken
a
year.
that
in
that
year,
the
new
haven
would
have
had
been
practically
as
it
stand
still
and
although
the
losses
for
that
year
were
already
charged
against
the
new
haven
that
the
commission
could
properly
charge
it
again
for
up
to
an
additional
sum
of
$15,
386,000.00
and
the
bulk
sale
discount
was
a
discount
of
about
$6
million.
the
commission
held
that
it
could
require
that
the
new
haven's
properties
be
sold
in
bulk
at
a
discount
because
it
had
the
power
to
condition
the
abandonment
certificate
on
a
sale
in
bulk.
this
abandonment
certificate
which
have
had
thought
would
have
to
be
sought,
which
was
never
sought
and
never
could
have
been
obtained
could
be
condition
on
this
bulk
sale
discount.
and
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
commission
went.
they
made
a
few
adjustments
upward
in
their
remand
report,
including
an
addition
of
sum
on
the
grand
central
terminal,
which
i
have
already
referred
to.
but
the
net
result
of
their
whole
operation
of
finding
liquidation
value
of
a
$132
million
and
then
making
this
large
deductions
was
to
arrive
at
a
figure
of
$140.6
million
to
which
it
added
$5
million
additional
arriving
at
a
total
figure
of
$145.6
million
and
then
it
proceeded
to
find
that
the
consideration
for
that,
which
was
largely
in
stock
was
worth
that
amount
and
therefore
it
would
approve
the
acquisition
at
that
price.
now
taking
the
figure
of
that
the
commission
arrived
at
that
i've
just
mentioned
just
so
you
have
a
kind
of
a
guide
to
what
it
did.
taking
the
price
of
penn
central
stock,
it
brought
in
the
consideration
in
december
1968
which
is
the
date
of
the
commission’s
remand
report,
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
would
have
received
24
cents
on
the
capital
on
a
dollar,
18
cents
on
a
dollar
if
interest
is
included.
you
will
see
at
once
of
course
that
the
expectations
of
the
reviewing
courts,
the
three-judge
court
that
$45-50
million
would
be
added
and
the
reorganization
court
that
$33-55
million
would
be
added
as
a
result
of
the
reconsideration
fell
far
short
of
achievement.
judge
anderson
when
the
prompt
of
the
remand
report
came
before
him
approved
the
immediate
transfer
of
the
property,
two
of
the
new
haven,
two
of
the
penn
central
so
that
the
property
would
be
required
before
the
end
of
the
year
having
previously
ruled
that
unless
there
was
transaction
before
the
end
of
the
year,
the
new
haven
trans
would
stop
running
on
january
1,
1969
because
the
erosion
would
then
gone
beyond
any
possible
constitutional
limit.
and
so
the
transfer
took
place
and
from
that
time
on
--
remember
this
was
before
your
honors,
there
was
an
effort
to
stop
the
transfer
and
the
courts
below
denied
a
stay
and
so
the
transfer
proceeded
leaving
the
question
of
price
opened.
now
the
state
of
the
conflict
between
the
courts
below
is
that
as
to
this
abandonment
delay
discount,
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
thought
it
was
entirely
unjustified
that
it
was
illegal
and
erroneous
and
was
not
sustained
by
substantial
evidence,
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet
and
the
three-judge
court
affirmed,
submitted
on
the
phase
of
there
opinion
somewhat
reluctantly
concluding
that
it
was
--
i
could
not
say
it
was
sustained
by
substantial
evidence
and
they
could
not
say
it
was
irrational,
but
they
did
sustain
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
a
very
short
time,
about
six
weeks.
so
it
was
before
the
three-judge
court.
the
division
between
the
courts
is
the
same
on
bulk
sale,
the
same
on
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards,
which
mr.
migdal
is
going
to
talk
about
and
then
on
the
certain
adjustments.
and
then
there
were
some
matters
on
which
the
courts
both
disagreed
with
the
position
of
the
appellants
here
and
we
are
going
to
present
some
of
those
points
on
argument
and
some
on
brief.
mr.
migdal
will
present
following
my
argument
the
matter
of
the
harlem
river
yards
and
the
matter
of
the
questions
on
the
grand
central
terminal
and
on
the
valuation
of
the
stock.
and
then
we
will
submit
some
of
the
points
on
briefs
because
there
obviously
isn't
time
to
cover
all
these
points.
we
submit
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
were
clearly
right
that
the
abandonment
delay
was
as
judge
anderson
said,
drag
in
by
the
heels
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
liquidation
value
that
which
both
courts
had
formerly
held
the
bondholders
were
entitled
and
there
isn't
any
real
dispute
here
that
liquidation
value
is
the
proper
standing.
the
deduction
of
$16
million
from
liquidation
value
was
found
by
the
commission
was
more
than
a
departure
in
the
interest
of
flexibility
or
as
the
commission
said
a
matter
of
refinement
or
a
matter
of
pricing
out.
it
really
subverted
the
whole
concept
of
using
liquidation
value
as
the
standard
and
there
was
no
justification
for
it.
from
the
beginning
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
no
application
to
abandon
and
liquidate
would
be
granted.
the
three-judge
court
thought
that
was
clear,
the
commission
thought
that
was
clear
and
it's
perfectly
evident
from
the
whole
course
of
these
proceedings
that
no
such
application
should
have
been
granted
--
would
have
been
granted.
and
the
requirement
that
that
hypothetical
application
should
be
made
that
these
charges
in
addition
to
the
losses
for
1967
should
be
pilled
on
it.
just
to
reduce
the
amount
the
penn
central
had
to
pay
for
this
property
seems
to
us
most
unjust
and
inequitable
as
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
viewed
it.
and
i
submit
that
that
decision
should
be
reversed.
other
details
of
that,
which
are
in
the
briefs,
it's
clear
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
if
the
commission
is
permitted
to
say
it
would
take
one
year,
then
i
could
say
it
would
take
two
years
and
they
can
make
an
allowance
for
that.
and
i
submit
that
it
opens
an
area
for
perfectly
arbitrary
conduct
and
decision,
which
the
court
should
not
permit.
if
i
understood
your
honors
correctly,
the
commission
could
then
spread
it
over
a
period
of
time
so
that
no
liquidation
value
would
be
paid.
i
submit
that
erosion
had
reached
the
outer
limits
and
no
further
erosion
was
fairly
and
properly
to
be
applied.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well
the
new
haven
was
running
in
the
year
1967
and
the
new
haven
had
to
use
it
--
the
losses
had
to
absorb
the
losses
for
1967.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
had
to
absorb
those
losses.
those
eroded
the
values
available
for
the
bondholders
to
the
extent
of
those
losses
because
they
were
paid
off,
in
some
fashion
it
came
ahead
of
the
bondholders.
now
in
addition
to
that
loss,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
put
$16
million
on
top
of
that
to
deduct
from
the
value
of
the
assets
remaining
and
therefore
has
piled
it
on
top
of
the
loss,
i
submit.
now
there's
some
details
of
that
pilling
on
which
there
is
not
time
to
talk
about,
but
they
have
made
up
the
$16
million
by
taking
first
alleged
delays
in
disposing
a
property,
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
non-railroad
property,
1,700
pieces
of
property
in
all
and
it
would
have
been
perfectly
possible
during
this
year
to
dispose
some
of
that
property.
they
have
added
on
preservation
cause,
which
are
not
sustained,
we
think
by
the
record
and
they’ve
added
on
taxes
which
after
all
would
not
been
added
to
if
some
of
the
property
was
disposed
on
a
reasonable
time.
so
that
if
you
came
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
sustain
the
conclusion
as
to
the
amount
of
this
loss,
you'd
find
it
wasn’t
sustained.
but
i
prefer
to
grapple
with
it
on
the
basis
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
improper
for
the
commission
to
apply
this
hypothetical
loss
to
reduce
the
minimum
value,
the
liquidation
value
to
which
we
submit
the
new
haven
was
entitled.
now
to
come
to
the
bulk
sale
discount,
which
is
in
a
kind
of
a
curious
position.
the
commission
held
that
they
have
power
and
to
condition
an
abandonment
certificate
on
requiring
that
the
property
be
sold
in
bulk
and
thus
they
arrive
at
the
bulk
sale
discount.
in
the
three-judge
court,
judge
friendly
thought
it
was
the
gravest
constitutional
doubt
above
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
condition
an
abandonment
to
which
they
were
constitutionally
entitled
of
losing
railroad
upon
a
sale
in
bulk.
and
therefore
he
thought
that
went
beyond
their
power.
so
he
sustained
the
decision
of
the
commission
on
a
wholly
different
ground
than
the
commission
had
taken.
he
sustained
it
on
the
ground
that
he
found
evidence
in
the
record
by
a
witness
named
simon
that
if
the
property
was
sold,
a
bulk
buyer
would
have
many
risks
on
which
he'd
want
to
get
a
discount.
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
the
discount
was
allowed
by
the
commission.
and
when
simon's
testimony
is
examined,
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
he
was
talking
about
acquiring
this
property
or
such
property
for
development
and
breaking
up
in
sale,
not
for
bulk
use
as
the
commissions
thought
it
should
be
without
breaking
up
the
railroad,
but
breaking
it
up
for
development
and
other
purposes.
and
i
submit
that
the
second
ground
on
which
the
commission
was
sustained
was
erroneous
that
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
commissioner’s
ruling
in
this
regard.
now
my
time
is
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
certainly.
certainly
and
i
think
that
that
stares
the
--
really
stares
the
three-judge
court
decision
right
in
the
phase.
but
let
me
just
add
a
word
about
scope
of
review
because
my
friends
in
the
government
say
that
it's
a
--
this
is
a
very
simple
case
in
which
the
only
question
is
scope
of
review
that
the
three-judge
court
applied
ecker,
that
judge
anderson
departed
from
ecker.
therefore,
you
sustained
the
three-judge
court
on
reversed
judge
anderson.
mr.
auerbach
will
present
the
view
that
may
well
be
that
a
court
in
reorganization
with
its
own
independent
judicial
duty
is
in
a
somewhat
different
position
and
the
ordinary
reviewing
court.
but
our
position
basically
that
whatever
the
standard
we
review,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
sustain
the
commission
on
this
discounts
and
that
with
regard
to
their
conclusion,
they
reach
the
decision
which
is
unjust
and
inequitable
under
the
test
both
of
the
commission's
statute
and
of
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
so
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
you
should
affirm
judge
anderson
who
has
lived
with
this
al
these
years
and
knows
what
the
discounts
were
and
not
pile
upon
the
losses
which
have
taken
place
through
erosion
of
$65
million,
the
additional
losses
which
the
commission
has
imposed
upon
the
new
haven.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
that
short
period
i
should
try
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
i
feel
either
are
more
--
my
adversaries
have
perhaps
not
done
in
clarity
just
as
to.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
reorganization
court
created
the
underwriting
agreement.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
your
honor.
the
three-judge
court
made
some
slight
modifications
in
the
reorganization
in
the
underwriting
formula
provided
by
judge
anderson
in
the
reorganization
court.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there
never
was
an
underwriting
agreement
(voice
overlap).
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there
never
was
an
underwriting
agreement
until
judge
anderson
created
it.
he
did
that
because
the
$83.1
million
was
so
inadequate
to
discharge
the
--
because
the
950,000
shares
was
so
inadequate
to
discharge
in
obligation
of
$83.1
million
and
this
was
sort
of
reform
movement
on
his
part.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
your
honor
if
you
found
--
it
would
not
have
to
go
back
if
you
found
that
the
950,000
shares
with
the
underwriting
was
the
equivalent
of
$83.1
million.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
but
if
you
find
that
it
is
not
then
there
are
several
things
that
are
wrong
whether
those
are
its
fee
that
provides
for
interests
its
fee
to
provide
the
security
and
so
on
then
it
must
go
back.
i
should
like
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
only
judge
winfield
decided
and
said
that
it's
still
not
provided
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
that's
exactly
the
posture.
that's
exactly
the
posture.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
nothing
more
or
less
but
as
of
the
closing
date
that
we
take
in
any
amount
once
we
could
get
them,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
and
i
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
and
that
related
to
the
question
of
who
bore
the
burden
here?
supposed
the
fact
the
court
decided
that
we
were
supposed
to
get
how
a
$100
million,
is
that
going
to
come
out
of
the
public's
pocket
or
is
that
going
to
come
out
of
penn
central’s
pocket
and
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
simple.
the
commission
has
the
power
to
make
up
that
$100
million
simply
in
shares
of
penn
central.
now,
if
that
happens
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
simply
by
providing
the
penn
central
pay
the
difference
in
shares
of
penn
central
and
if
that
happens
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
right,
if
penn
central
pay
that,
now
if
that
happens
that
will
have
no
effect
on
the
ratemaking
function
or
any
other
function
it
will
just
have
an
effect
on
the
earnings
per
share
of
penn
central
which
would
be
diluted
as
far
as
the
equity
holders
of
penn
central
were
concerned.
it
would
have
some
modest
effect
on
the
equity
that
they
would
have
because
there'd
be
more
shares
outstanding
than
the
earnings
per
share
would
therefore
decline
slightly.
it
would
have
an
immaterial
effect
therefore
on
penn
central
stockholders
and
no
effect
on
the
public
if
the
commission
would
like
it
to
provide
that
difference
in
shares.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
would
be
a
part
of
its
assets
because
there
is
after
all
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
your
honor,
if
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
receiving
not
$162
million
worth
of
assets
but
$262
million
worth
of
assets
which
is
why
its
required
to
pay
another
$100
million.
there
is
no
injury
to
penn
central.
it's
simply
paying
exactly
for
what
it's
getting.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
simply
because
all
you
have
done
is
found
that
it
was
underpaying
by
a
$100
million
and
taking
advantage
of
the
$100
million
of
the
new
haven
assets.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
in
the
form,
your
honor
of
shares
it
would
not
be
a
serious
burden.
it
would
only
be
a
serious
burden.
it
would
be
more
of
a
burden
obviously
if
it
were
in
bonds
because
then
there
would
be
an
addition
to
fixed
charges.
suppose
they
have
to
issue
another
$100
million
worth
of
bonds.
that
issue
another
$100
million
worth
of
bonds
then
those
bonds
have
a
5%
rate
penn
central
would
have
to
pay
out
$5
million
a
year.
now,
that
$5
million
a
year
would
have
the
effect
on
penn
central’s
earnings
per
share,
the
21
cents
it
will
reduce
their
earnings
per
share
by
21
cents
if
you
gave
a
whole
$100
million
in
bonds.
if
on
the
other
hand
you
gave
in
shares
you
would
not
effect
the
fixed
charges
at
all
because
it
wouldn’t
be
a
requirement
that
they
pay
dividends
unless
they
were
earned
so
the
only
difference
would
be
as
to
the
extent
to
which
there
might
be
some
slight
dividend
in
payment
to
the
extent
that
you
provided
the
additional
conservation.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
if
you
wish
you
would
share
us
the
same
rate
base
on
share
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
because
it
wouldn't
affect
the
fixed
debt,
your
honor,
all
you
were
doing
is
honoring
the
equities
structure
here
and
not
the
debt
structure.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
might
be,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
to
mr.
justice
white
about
the
question
as
to
whether
these
were
in
fact
claims
that
came
ahead.
the
$60
million
were
actually
claims
that
came
ahead
of
those
the
bondholders
that
they
were,
all
of
them
claims
that
came
ahead
of
the
bondholders
claims,
not
just
the
trustee’s
certificates
but
the
way
in
which
all
of
these
erosion
occur
was
because
the
reorganization
court
enjoined
the
collection
of
a
lot
of
obligations
that
we
were
running
up
in
the
course
of
that
period
so
that
the
states
were
not
being
paid
their
taxes
though
their
claims
came
ahead
of
us
and
indeed,
the
tort
claims.
people
injured
on
the
road
during
the
administration
they're
still
outstanding
and
the
per
diem
claims.
all
the
railroads
who
put
cars
on
our
line,
we
have
to
pay
it.
we
weren't
paying
but
their
claims
are
ahead
of
ours.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
their
administration
claims
that
you
can
find
all
of
that
at
page
181-a
because
the
commission
itself
set
it
out
and
put
a
value
on
it
and
made
a
chart
and
it
appeals
on
the
remand
report
and
it’s
at
page
181-a
of
the
appendix
of
decisions
of
constitutional
statutory
provisions
that
were
handed
up
with
our
briefs.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
somewhere
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
some
were
it
would
have
been
repossessed
and
some
have
excess
value
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
that
what
happened
there
was
that.
we
have
maintained
those
throughout
the
administration
otherwise,
they
would
have
been
repossessed.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
therefore
although
they
were
debts
with
respect
to
those
railroad
costs
those
were
taken
over
when
the
cars
were
taken
over
by
penn
central
at
the
closing.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor
and
one
of
the
earlier
opinions
of
judge
friendly.
he
had
noted
that
of
course
if
you
were
going
to
predicate
some
kind
of
delay
then
you
couldn't
simply
predicate
the
delay
without
revaluing
the
assets
and
therefore
his
remand
in
the
first
instance
was
on
a
very
limited
ground.
he
had
asked
that
the
remand
be
on
limited
ground.
it
is
absolutely
unfair
however
we
may
entail
for
the
commission
to
stand
here
on
the
posture
and
saying
that
there
was
a
quantifying
of
risks
with
respect
to
that
bulk
sale.
if
you
read
the
commission's
report
you
will
see
that
everything
that
the
commission
has
to
say
about
the
success
under
a
single
title
limitations
on
the
right
to
break
up
the
railroad.
it
does,
there
was
no
question
of
quantifying
any
risks.
mr.
simon
did
not
know
for
example,
whether
the
appraisals
that
he
was
addressing
himself
to
had
been
made
on
a
very
conservative
basis
or
whether
they
have
been
made
on
the
generous
basis.
now,
obviously
if
you
make
it
on
a
generous
basis
then
you
have
got
to
worry
about
the
possibility
of
whether
it
would
be
completed
in
six
years
or
what
other
impacts
thereat.
mr.
simon
knew
nothing
about
that.
what
mr.
simon
said
and
it's
quoted
at
page
29
of
our
reply
brief
was,
“we
are
not
talking
today
of
about
uses
but
we
have
been
assuming
of
bulk
sale
and
we
have
been
discussing
about
the
decision
which
is
on
railroad’s
hands
as
to
whether
or
not
to
go
through
a
retail
process
themselves.”
and
he
says
also,
that
--
and
he
said
in
other
places
that
he
himself
did
not
study
the
appraisals.
he
simply
assumed
that
they
were
carefully
made.
if
he
didn't
know
what
the
commission
in
fact
said
about
and
that
was
that
they
were
conservative.
they
understood
the
possibility
that
there
was
10-year
liquidation
study
performed
with
a
7%
discount
as
against
the
six-year
liquidation
with
the
6%
discount
and
they
elected
that
but
you'd
have
to
imagine
the
most
remarkable
coincidence
that
precisely
the
profit
the
bulk
buyer
would
require
which
was
computed
on
the
basis
of
25%
of
his
own
invested
capital
giving
him
a
profit
of
15%
and
75%
borrowed
at
a
9%
rate
would
exactly
equal
the
risks
which
the
commission
had
somehow
overlooked.
obviously,
he
was
not
quantifying
any
of
those
risks
because
he
didn't
know
what
they
were
and
that
kind
of
coincidence
would
have
been
an
absolute
miracle.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
the
inflationary
factor
alone
is
going
to
deprive
him
of
a
good
deal
of
a
risk.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
my
answer
however
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
in
the
first
part
was
subject
to
some
misinterpretation.
my
colleagues
inform
me
that
it
was
possible
to
interpret
my
answer's
meaning
but
penn
central
have
the
right
to
buy
in
50,000
share
blocks
from
us
and
in
that
way
we
lost
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
underwriting.
what
i
meant
was
this
that
at
any
time
they
could
pay
us
the
difference
between
what
the
value
of
the
shares
than
was
at
$87.50
and
be
free
of
the
underwriting.
now,
at
that
point
we
stood
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
anybody
else
who
bought
shares
of
stock.
if
we
were
stockholder,
if
we
kept
them,
we
kept
them
at
our
own
risk.
if
we
sold
them,
we
sold
them
on
our
own
risk.
and
there
was
layer
for
this
way
out
to
avoid
our
having
the
best
of
both
possible
worlds.
in
any
event,
that
i
would
say
is
this,
the
underwriting
saw
the
laces.
it
puts
us
off
so
far
ahead
1978.
it
gives
us
that
in
such
an
insecure
way.
that
might
be
an
enormous
bill
for
penn
central
to
pay.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
your
honor,
i
believe
we
went
into
--
i
would
say
that
the
commission
has
the
power
in
such
a
force
sale
as
this
and
i
would
say
that
this
was
never
a
reorganization
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
it
could
require
us
to
take
stock
in
all
likelihood
as
long
as
it
was
that
--
as
long
as
it
represented
the
cash
equivalent
of
what
they
gave
out.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
on
that
day.
i
think
that
that
far,
its
interest
in
--
that
far
it
had
a
right
to
protect
the
public
interest
by
seeing
that
it
did
not
so
burden
penn
central
in
the
form
of
a
payment.
i
don't
think
that
it
could
take
anything
away
from
the
bondholders
so
far
as
constitutional
rights
were
concerned.
but
so
far
as
protecting
penn
central
and
the
public
interest
in
the
form
of
a
payment,
as
long
as
it
gave
us
the
equivalent
of
what
we
were
asked,
i
think
to
that
extent
it
could
decide
what
the
form
of
the
security
should
be
and
we
never
complained
about
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
your
honor
and
in
our
briefs
we
have
pointed
out
that
that
was
another
error
that
while
with
respect
to
our
real
estate
for
example,
every
selling
expense
was
deducted.
brokerage
fees,
lawyers’
fess,
the
expensive
advertising,
and
everything
else
in
order
to
get
down
to
out
net
salvage
value.
with
respect
to
the
shares
at
$83.1
million,
even
then
they
failed
to
take
it
into
account
our
selling
expenses
as
a
counter,
you
know,
in
order
to
keep
both
sides
of
the
equation
equitable
but
they
did
not
do
that.
on
the
harlem
river
yards
point,
i
would
like
to
say
this.
mr.
cox,
it
seems
to
me
is
still
suggesting
that
we
are
entitled
the
liquidation
value
on
something
less
than
our
best
method
of
liquidation.
both
--
there
were
two
witnesses
for
penn
central
on
the
harlem
river
yards
and
both
right
on
the
river.
penn
central
witnesses
testified
that
someone
would
provide
service
to
those
yards.
this
was
not
something
that
we
have
made
up.
the
only
question
is
where
it
is
clear
that
someone
would
provide
rail
service
to
those
yards
is
there
any
basis
in
law
for
valuing
and
for
finding
that
liquidation
value
on
something
less
than
fair
market
value
on
our
best
method
of
liquidation.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
thank
you
sir.
i
am
going
to
open
for
the
appellants
on
our
side.
i
represent
the
trustee
manufacturers
hanover
trust
company
under
the
represent
the
first
mortgage
bonds.
i
will
be
followed
by
mr.
migdal
who
represents
the
bond
holders
committee
and
he
will
be
followed
mr.
auerbach
who
represents
the
trustee.
a
little
later
on,
i'll
explain
the
division
of
argument
after
i've
gotten
started.
the
bonds
outstanding
of
this
railroad
consist
of
$76
million
of
first
mortgage
bonds
with
about
$24
million
of
accrued
interest,
and
$53
million
of
second
mortgage
bonds.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
harlem
river
divisional
bond
will
be
paid
off
so
that
there
is
only
a
permanent
two
classes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
court
already
has
some
familiarity
with
these
matters
in
the
penn-central
merger
case,
the
inclusion
report
of
the
commission,
which
i
will
have
occasionally,
refer
to
was
before
the
court
at
the
time
it
decided
the
penn-central
merger
case.
the
new
haven
filed
a
petition
for
reorganization
in
the
connecticut
district
court
in
1961
and
that
reorganization
has
continued
since.
judge
robert
anderson
was
in
charge
of
the
reorganization
from
the
beginning
and
continued
to
be
after
his
appointment
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
--
and
is
a
somewhat
unusual
type
of
reorganization
from
the
very
beginning
because
the
railroad
had
been
running
deficit
since
at
least
1956.
it
was
apparent
that
the
only
way
to
keep
the
railroad
running
was
to
have
some
kind
of
a
merger
or
sale
to
another
railroad
in
existence.
and
during
the
time
of
reorganization,
that
is
from
1961
down
through
the
1968
at
which
time
the
penn
central
took
over
the
new
haven
and
paid
over
the
considerations
subject
to
review
of
the
problem
of
price.
the
reorganization
had
accumulated
some
$65
million
of
charges
and
claims
ahead
of
the
bonds
as
a
result
of
reorganization
expenses
and
borrowings
and
so
on.
this
process
continued,
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
because
of
the
determination
on
the
part
of
a
judge
and
the
trustees
and
the
trustees’
counsel
and
the
commission
to
keep
the
railroad
running
and
a
proper
feeling
on
the
part
of
judge
anderson
and
the
others
that
new
england
required
the
continuation
of
this
railroad.
i
think
your
honors
are
familiar
enough
with
its
physical
circumstances,
so
that
help
me
to
go
into
those
that
runs
from
massachusetts,
rhode
island,
connecticut
and
new
york
and
these
both
are
a
railroad
which
takes
commuter
traffic
and
interstate
traffic
of
a
more
general
in
character.
it's
clear
i
think
that
from
the
very
beginning,
the
trustees
were
seeking
to
find
a
railroad
with
which
there
might
be
a
merger
of
the
new
haven
or
an
acquisition
of
the
new
haven
and
that
from
the
very
beginning
while
this
search
went
on,
there
was
no
prospect
that
the
road
could
have
been
abandoned
or
liquidated
because
of
the
concern
of
everyone
to
keep
it
running.
in
1961,
the
trustees
approached
the
pennsylvania
and
the
new
york
central
on
behalf
of
new
haven
to
see
if
they
were
interested
in
some
acquisition
and
in
1962,
they
reported
that
the
only
salvation
for
this
railroad
was
some
kind
of
a
merger
or
acquisition.
and
in
the
same
month,
march
1962,
the
pennsylvania
and
the
central
asked
approval
of
their
merger
under
section
52
of
the
commission.
in
june
1962,
the
trustees
intervened
in
the
merger
case
to
seek
inclusion.
there
were
negotiations
in
1964
between
penn
central
and
the
trustees
which
were
unknown
to
the
bondholders
and
which
ultimately
resulted
in
an
agreement
which
was
disposed
for
the
first
time
in
a
report
of
a
commission
examiner,
an
agreement
under
which
the
merged
corporation
would
acquire
the
new
haven
assets
for
certain
specified
considerations.
the
commission
approved
the
merger
and
required
penn
central
to
include
both
passenger
and
freight
operations
and
said
in
its
order,
“all
upon
such
fair
and
equitable
term
as
the
parties
may
agree
subject
to
the
approval
of
a
bankruptcy
court
and
the
commission.”
in
october
1966,
the
trustees
and
penn
central
filed
their
agreed
purchase
agreement
as
a
first
step
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
hearings
before
an
examiner
followed,
report
was
dispensed
with
and
the
matter
was
submitted
directly
to
the
commission.
for
some
intermediate
proceedings
and
in
which
arrangements
were
made
for
loans
to
the
new
haven
and
other
matters,
but
i
don’t
see
if
they’re
relevant
to
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
and
the
were
cited
in
the
brief
and
i
won’t
take
time
to
talk
about.
there
followed
the
inclusion
report
of
november
1967,
which
is
the
report
which
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
penn-central
merger,
at
least
this
court
knew
about
it.
that
report
led
to
the
first
round
of
these
appellants’
successful
applications
to
the
courts
below,
and
both
courts
below
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
essence
of
that
inclusion
report
as
far
as
the
new
haven
is
concerned
is
that
using
evaluation
as
the
evaluation
date,
december
31,
1966,
the
commission
found
net
liquidation
value
of
the
new
haven
assets
was
a
$128.9
million,
which
had
rounded
to
a
$125
million.
it
found
the
fair
value
of
the
consideration
to
be
paid
by
the
penn
central
under
the
purchase
agreement
was
a
$123.6
million
which
had
rounded
to
a
$125
million
so
that
the
consideration
and
the
value
of
the
liquidation
value
were
similar
and
because
of
that,
equality
which
it
saw
in
the
transaction
had
held
that
the
transaction
met
statutory
standards
and
approved
it
by
the
appellant.
the
present
appellants
petitioned
for
review
and
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
consisting
of
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet,
and
judge
weinfeld
from
the
southern
district.
by
order
of
may
1968,
the
court
disapproved
the
inclusion
report
on
the
ground
that
it
appeared
that
the
penn
central
should
pay
an
additional
sum
of
$45
to
$50
million.
i
don't
think
there's
any
use
in
going
into
the
items
there,
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
15
from
judge
winfield's
later
dissenting
opinion.
while
the
matter
was
pending
before
the
three-judge
court,
the
commission
submitted
the
purchase
agreement
to
the
reorganization
court
as
step
one
in
the
plan
of
reorganization.
in
april
1968,
the
court
appointed
a
former
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
judge
john
van
voorhis
has
a
special
master
that
considered
the
problems
that
are
arising
out
of
the
grand
central
terminal
property.
we
don't
say
a
word
about
that
although
mr.
migdal
is
going
to
carry
the
argument
on
the
point
on
the
matter
that
it’s
still
open.
just
after
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
railroads
using
grand
central
terminal
came
down
a
great
open
ditch,
which
is
now
park
avenue
and
that
seemed
to
kind
of
a
waste
of
a
valuable
property.
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
it
was
bridged
over
to
create
park
avenue,
and
as
a
result
of
that
and
the
agreements
between
the
central
and
the
new
haven,
a
number
of
the
principal
hotels
at
which
we
have
all
to
few
left
were
built
the
waldorf,
the
biltmore,
the
commodore,
the
roosevelt,
the
pan-am
building
is
older
than
the
yale
club.
the
new
haven
and
penn
central
--
the
central
had
a
sort
of
a
partnership
interest
in
these
properties
and
there
was
dispute
about
the
nature
of
that
interest
and
its
value.
the
commission
in
its
inclusion
report
stuck
a
balance
between
various
possibilities
and
arrive
at
a
figure
of
$13
million
as
the
figure
that
should
be
allowed,
but
that
was
evidently
too
low
and
judge
van
voorhis
was
asked
to
report
his
views
about
the
legal
relationships.
and
he
upheld
the
view
that
there
was
a
partnership
interest
in
connection
with
the
grand
central
properties
and
ultimately
as
i
will
show
your
honors
in
the
remand
report
the
original
loss
of
$13
million
was
advanced
to
$28
million
so
that
under
the
present
position
of
the
commission,
the
new
haven
is
entitled
to
$28
million
for
its
interest.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
value
of
the
property
is
$227
million
so
that
the
penn
central
has
acquired
a
very
valuable
property
for
a
very
small
amount.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes.
because
of
his
background
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
he
was
thought
to
be
a
great
expert
in
the
new
york
property
problems
and
so
he
was
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes
he
is
practicing
law
in
new
york.
the
reorganization
court
like
the
three-judge
court
concluded
that
the
allowance
by
the
commission
was
inadequate
that
the
undervalued
property
and
he
too
remanded
to
the
commission.
the
three-judge
court
thought
that
the
amount
the
commission
should
increase
its
determination
value
was
$45-50
million.
judge
van
voorhis
spread
was
a
little
wider.
he
thought
it
should
be
$33-55
million.
judge
anderson,
i
beg
your
pardon,
judge
anderson.
the
commission
proceeded
the
whole
expedited
hearings
and
made
its
remand
report
on
november
25,
1968
and
this
is
the
one
which
these
appellants
attacked
here,
and
so
i
will
be
talking
about
some
phases
of
that
a
little
later
on.
the
commission
was
sustained
on
some
matters
by
the
courts
later
on.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
take
any
time
on
that.
so
what
we
are
going
to
talk
about
on
our
side
are
those
things
where
the
commission
was
sustained
by
division
among
the
judges
and
those
things
where
the
commission
was
not
sustained
--
or
was
sustained
but
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
sustaining
it.
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
remand
was
starting
with
the
liquidation
value
of
a
$125
million,
which
the
court
had
found
for
a
$128
million
--
128.9,
which
the
commission
had
found
on
its
origin
inclusion
order
and
increasing
that
to
a
$162.7
million
and
then
immediately
retreated
by
a
series
of
deductions,
major
deductions
from
that
amount.
the
most
significant
and
those
to
which
i
am
going
to
address
myself
being
to
totaling
$22
million.
one
is
so
called
discount
for
a
abandonment
delay
and
the
other
discount
for
--
so
called
discount
for
bulk
sale.
and
in
both
this
cases,
our
position
is
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
who
dissented
below
were
correct
in
their
view
that
this
discounts
were
unjustified
and
that
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet
were
wrong
in
concluding
that
they
could
be
justified.
and
so
we
shall
ask
your
honors
to
follow
the
reorganization
court
on
these
matters.
our
order
to
about
what
they
were.
the
first
discount,
the
abandonment
delay
discount
or
as
in
the
substantial
figure
of
$15,386,000.00
and
this
was
based
upon
the
theory
that
beginning
in
1967,
the
new
haven
would
have
had
to
start
abandonment
proceeding
that
that
would
have
taken
a
year.
that
in
that
year,
the
new
haven
would
have
had
been
practically
as
it
stand
still
and
although
the
losses
for
that
year
were
already
charged
against
the
new
haven
that
the
commission
could
properly
charge
it
again
for
up
to
an
additional
sum
of
$15,
386,000.00
and
the
bulk
sale
discount
was
a
discount
of
about
$6
million.
the
commission
held
that
it
could
require
that
the
new
haven's
properties
be
sold
in
bulk
at
a
discount
because
it
had
the
power
to
condition
the
abandonment
certificate
on
a
sale
in
bulk.
this
abandonment
certificate
which
have
had
thought
would
have
to
be
sought,
which
was
never
sought
and
never
could
have
been
obtained
could
be
condition
on
this
bulk
sale
discount.
and
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
commission
went.
they
made
a
few
adjustments
upward
in
their
remand
report,
including
an
addition
of
sum
on
the
grand
central
terminal,
which
i
have
already
referred
to.
but
the
net
result
of
their
whole
operation
of
finding
liquidation
value
of
a
$132
million
and
then
making
this
large
deductions
was
to
arrive
at
a
figure
of
$140.6
million
to
which
it
added
$5
million
additional
arriving
at
a
total
figure
of
$145.6
million
and
then
it
proceeded
to
find
that
the
consideration
for
that,
which
was
largely
in
stock
was
worth
that
amount
and
therefore
it
would
approve
the
acquisition
at
that
price.
now
taking
the
figure
of
that
the
commission
arrived
at
that
i've
just
mentioned
just
so
you
have
a
kind
of
a
guide
to
what
it
did.
taking
the
price
of
penn
central
stock,
it
brought
in
the
consideration
in
december
1968
which
is
the
date
of
the
commission’s
remand
report,
the
first
mortgage
bondholders
would
have
received
24
cents
on
the
capital
on
a
dollar,
18
cents
on
a
dollar
if
interest
is
included.
you
will
see
at
once
of
course
that
the
expectations
of
the
reviewing
courts,
the
three-judge
court
that
$45-50
million
would
be
added
and
the
reorganization
court
that
$33-55
million
would
be
added
as
a
result
of
the
reconsideration
fell
far
short
of
achievement.
judge
anderson
when
the
prompt
of
the
remand
report
came
before
him
approved
the
immediate
transfer
of
the
property,
two
of
the
new
haven,
two
of
the
penn
central
so
that
the
property
would
be
required
before
the
end
of
the
year
having
previously
ruled
that
unless
there
was
transaction
before
the
end
of
the
year,
the
new
haven
trans
would
stop
running
on
january
1,
1969
because
the
erosion
would
then
gone
beyond
any
possible
constitutional
limit.
and
so
the
transfer
took
place
and
from
that
time
on
--
remember
this
was
before
your
honors,
there
was
an
effort
to
stop
the
transfer
and
the
courts
below
denied
a
stay
and
so
the
transfer
proceeded
leaving
the
question
of
price
opened.
now
the
state
of
the
conflict
between
the
courts
below
is
that
as
to
this
abandonment
delay
discount,
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
thought
it
was
entirely
unjustified
that
it
was
illegal
and
erroneous
and
was
not
sustained
by
substantial
evidence,
judge
friendly
and
judge
levet
and
the
three-judge
court
affirmed,
submitted
on
the
phase
of
there
opinion
somewhat
reluctantly
concluding
that
it
was
--
i
could
not
say
it
was
sustained
by
substantial
evidence
and
they
could
not
say
it
was
irrational,
but
they
did
sustain
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
a
very
short
time,
about
six
weeks.
so
it
was
before
the
three-judge
court.
the
division
between
the
courts
is
the
same
on
bulk
sale,
the
same
on
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards,
which
mr.
migdal
is
going
to
talk
about
and
then
on
the
certain
adjustments.
and
then
there
were
some
matters
on
which
the
courts
both
disagreed
with
the
position
of
the
appellants
here
and
we
are
going
to
present
some
of
those
points
on
argument
and
some
on
brief.
mr.
migdal
will
present
following
my
argument
the
matter
of
the
harlem
river
yards
and
the
matter
of
the
questions
on
the
grand
central
terminal
and
on
the
valuation
of
the
stock.
and
then
we
will
submit
some
of
the
points
on
briefs
because
there
obviously
isn't
time
to
cover
all
these
points.
we
submit
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
were
clearly
right
that
the
abandonment
delay
was
as
judge
anderson
said,
drag
in
by
the
heels
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
liquidation
value
that
which
both
courts
had
formerly
held
the
bondholders
were
entitled
and
there
isn't
any
real
dispute
here
that
liquidation
value
is
the
proper
standing.
the
deduction
of
$16
million
from
liquidation
value
was
found
by
the
commission
was
more
than
a
departure
in
the
interest
of
flexibility
or
as
the
commission
said
a
matter
of
refinement
or
a
matter
of
pricing
out.
it
really
subverted
the
whole
concept
of
using
liquidation
value
as
the
standard
and
there
was
no
justification
for
it.
from
the
beginning
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
no
application
to
abandon
and
liquidate
would
be
granted.
the
three-judge
court
thought
that
was
clear,
the
commission
thought
that
was
clear
and
it's
perfectly
evident
from
the
whole
course
of
these
proceedings
that
no
such
application
should
have
been
granted
--
would
have
been
granted.
and
the
requirement
that
that
hypothetical
application
should
be
made
that
these
charges
in
addition
to
the
losses
for
1967
should
be
pilled
on
it.
just
to
reduce
the
amount
the
penn
central
had
to
pay
for
this
property
seems
to
us
most
unjust
and
inequitable
as
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
viewed
it.
and
i
submit
that
that
decision
should
be
reversed.
other
details
of
that,
which
are
in
the
briefs,
it's
clear
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
if
the
commission
is
permitted
to
say
it
would
take
one
year,
then
i
could
say
it
would
take
two
years
and
they
can
make
an
allowance
for
that.
and
i
submit
that
it
opens
an
area
for
perfectly
arbitrary
conduct
and
decision,
which
the
court
should
not
permit.
if
i
understood
your
honors
correctly,
the
commission
could
then
spread
it
over
a
period
of
time
so
that
no
liquidation
value
would
be
paid.
i
submit
that
erosion
had
reached
the
outer
limits
and
no
further
erosion
was
fairly
and
properly
to
be
applied.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well
the
new
haven
was
running
in
the
year
1967
and
the
new
haven
had
to
use
it
--
the
losses
had
to
absorb
the
losses
for
1967.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
had
to
absorb
those
losses.
those
eroded
the
values
available
for
the
bondholders
to
the
extent
of
those
losses
because
they
were
paid
off,
in
some
fashion
it
came
ahead
of
the
bondholders.
now
in
addition
to
that
loss,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
put
$16
million
on
top
of
that
to
deduct
from
the
value
of
the
assets
remaining
and
therefore
has
piled
it
on
top
of
the
loss,
i
submit.
now
there's
some
details
of
that
pilling
on
which
there
is
not
time
to
talk
about,
but
they
have
made
up
the
$16
million
by
taking
first
alleged
delays
in
disposing
a
property,
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
non-railroad
property,
1,700
pieces
of
property
in
all
and
it
would
have
been
perfectly
possible
during
this
year
to
dispose
some
of
that
property.
they
have
added
on
preservation
cause,
which
are
not
sustained,
we
think
by
the
record
and
they’ve
added
on
taxes
which
after
all
would
not
been
added
to
if
some
of
the
property
was
disposed
on
a
reasonable
time.
so
that
if
you
came
to
look
at
whether
or
not
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
sustain
the
conclusion
as
to
the
amount
of
this
loss,
you'd
find
it
wasn’t
sustained.
but
i
prefer
to
grapple
with
it
on
the
basis
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
improper
for
the
commission
to
apply
this
hypothetical
loss
to
reduce
the
minimum
value,
the
liquidation
value
to
which
we
submit
the
new
haven
was
entitled.
now
to
come
to
the
bulk
sale
discount,
which
is
in
a
kind
of
a
curious
position.
the
commission
held
that
they
have
power
and
to
condition
an
abandonment
certificate
on
requiring
that
the
property
be
sold
in
bulk
and
thus
they
arrive
at
the
bulk
sale
discount.
in
the
three-judge
court,
judge
friendly
thought
it
was
the
gravest
constitutional
doubt
above
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
condition
an
abandonment
to
which
they
were
constitutionally
entitled
of
losing
railroad
upon
a
sale
in
bulk.
and
therefore
he
thought
that
went
beyond
their
power.
so
he
sustained
the
decision
of
the
commission
on
a
wholly
different
ground
than
the
commission
had
taken.
he
sustained
it
on
the
ground
that
he
found
evidence
in
the
record
by
a
witness
named
simon
that
if
the
property
was
sold,
a
bulk
buyer
would
have
many
risks
on
which
he'd
want
to
get
a
discount.
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
the
discount
was
allowed
by
the
commission.
and
when
simon's
testimony
is
examined,
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
he
was
talking
about
acquiring
this
property
or
such
property
for
development
and
breaking
up
in
sale,
not
for
bulk
use
as
the
commissions
thought
it
should
be
without
breaking
up
the
railroad,
but
breaking
it
up
for
development
and
other
purposes.
and
i
submit
that
the
second
ground
on
which
the
commission
was
sustained
was
erroneous
that
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
commissioner’s
ruling
in
this
regard.
now
my
time
is
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
certainly.
certainly
and
i
think
that
that
stares
the
--
really
stares
the
three-judge
court
decision
right
in
the
phase.
but
let
me
just
add
a
word
about
scope
of
review
because
my
friends
in
the
government
say
that
it's
a
--
this
is
a
very
simple
case
in
which
the
only
question
is
scope
of
review
that
the
three-judge
court
applied
ecker,
that
judge
anderson
departed
from
ecker.
therefore,
you
sustained
the
three-judge
court
on
reversed
judge
anderson.
mr.
auerbach
will
present
the
view
that
may
well
be
that
a
court
in
reorganization
with
its
own
independent
judicial
duty
is
in
a
somewhat
different
position
and
the
ordinary
reviewing
court.
but
our
position
basically
that
whatever
the
standard
we
review,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
sustain
the
commission
on
this
discounts
and
that
with
regard
to
their
conclusion,
they
reach
the
decision
which
is
unjust
and
inequitable
under
the
test
both
of
the
commission's
statute
and
of
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
so
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
you
should
affirm
judge
anderson
who
has
lived
with
this
al
these
years
and
knows
what
the
discounts
were
and
not
pile
upon
the
losses
which
have
taken
place
through
erosion
of
$65
million,
the
additional
losses
which
the
commission
has
imposed
upon
the
new
haven.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
that
short
period
i
should
try
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
i
feel
either
are
more
--
my
adversaries
have
perhaps
not
done
in
clarity
just
as
to.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
the
reorganization
court
created
the
underwriting
agreement.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
your
honor.
the
three-judge
court
made
some
slight
modifications
in
the
reorganization
in
the
underwriting
formula
provided
by
judge
anderson
in
the
reorganization
court.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there
never
was
an
underwriting
agreement
(voice
overlap).
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there
never
was
an
underwriting
agreement
until
judge
anderson
created
it.
he
did
that
because
the
$83.1
million
was
so
inadequate
to
discharge
the
--
because
the
950,000
shares
was
so
inadequate
to
discharge
in
obligation
of
$83.1
million
and
this
was
sort
of
reform
movement
on
his
part.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
your
honor
if
you
found
--
it
would
not
have
to
go
back
if
you
found
that
the
950,000
shares
with
the
underwriting
was
the
equivalent
of
$83.1
million.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
but
if
you
find
that
it
is
not
then
there
are
several
things
that
are
wrong
whether
those
are
its
fee
that
provides
for
interests
its
fee
to
provide
the
security
and
so
on
then
it
must
go
back.
i
should
like
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
only
judge
winfield
decided
and
said
that
it's
still
not
provided
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
that's
exactly
the
posture.
that's
exactly
the
posture.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
nothing
more
or
less
but
as
of
the
closing
date
that
we
take
in
any
amount
once
we
could
get
them,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
and
i
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
asked
and
that
related
to
the
question
of
who
bore
the
burden
here?
supposed
the
fact
the
court
decided
that
we
were
supposed
to
get
how
a
$100
million,
is
that
going
to
come
out
of
the
public's
pocket
or
is
that
going
to
come
out
of
penn
central’s
pocket
and
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
simple.
the
commission
has
the
power
to
make
up
that
$100
million
simply
in
shares
of
penn
central.
now,
if
that
happens
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
simply
by
providing
the
penn
central
pay
the
difference
in
shares
of
penn
central
and
if
that
happens
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that's
right,
if
penn
central
pay
that,
now
if
that
happens
that
will
have
no
effect
on
the
ratemaking
function
or
any
other
function
it
will
just
have
an
effect
on
the
earnings
per
share
of
penn
central
which
would
be
diluted
as
far
as
the
equity
holders
of
penn
central
were
concerned.
it
would
have
some
modest
effect
on
the
equity
that
they
would
have
because
there'd
be
more
shares
outstanding
than
the
earnings
per
share
would
therefore
decline
slightly.
it
would
have
an
immaterial
effect
therefore
on
penn
central
stockholders
and
no
effect
on
the
public
if
the
commission
would
like
it
to
provide
that
difference
in
shares.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
would
be
a
part
of
its
assets
because
there
is
after
all
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
your
honor,
if
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
receiving
not
$162
million
worth
of
assets
but
$262
million
worth
of
assets
which
is
why
its
required
to
pay
another
$100
million.
there
is
no
injury
to
penn
central.
it's
simply
paying
exactly
for
what
it's
getting.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
simply
because
all
you
have
done
is
found
that
it
was
underpaying
by
a
$100
million
and
taking
advantage
of
the
$100
million
of
the
new
haven
assets.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
in
the
form,
your
honor
of
shares
it
would
not
be
a
serious
burden.
it
would
only
be
a
serious
burden.
it
would
be
more
of
a
burden
obviously
if
it
were
in
bonds
because
then
there
would
be
an
addition
to
fixed
charges.
suppose
they
have
to
issue
another
$100
million
worth
of
bonds.
that
issue
another
$100
million
worth
of
bonds
then
those
bonds
have
a
5%
rate
penn
central
would
have
to
pay
out
$5
million
a
year.
now,
that
$5
million
a
year
would
have
the
effect
on
penn
central’s
earnings
per
share,
the
21
cents
it
will
reduce
their
earnings
per
share
by
21
cents
if
you
gave
a
whole
$100
million
in
bonds.
if
on
the
other
hand
you
gave
in
shares
you
would
not
effect
the
fixed
charges
at
all
because
it
wouldn’t
be
a
requirement
that
they
pay
dividends
unless
they
were
earned
so
the
only
difference
would
be
as
to
the
extent
to
which
there
might
be
some
slight
dividend
in
payment
to
the
extent
that
you
provided
the
additional
conservation.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
if
you
wish
you
would
share
us
the
same
rate
base
on
share
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
because
it
wouldn't
affect
the
fixed
debt,
your
honor,
all
you
were
doing
is
honoring
the
equities
structure
here
and
not
the
debt
structure.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
might
be,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
to
mr.
justice
white
about
the
question
as
to
whether
these
were
in
fact
claims
that
came
ahead.
the
$60
million
were
actually
claims
that
came
ahead
of
those
the
bondholders
that
they
were,
all
of
them
claims
that
came
ahead
of
the
bondholders
claims,
not
just
the
trustee’s
certificates
but
the
way
in
which
all
of
these
erosion
occur
was
because
the
reorganization
court
enjoined
the
collection
of
a
lot
of
obligations
that
we
were
running
up
in
the
course
of
that
period
so
that
the
states
were
not
being
paid
their
taxes
though
their
claims
came
ahead
of
us
and
indeed,
the
tort
claims.
people
injured
on
the
road
during
the
administration
they're
still
outstanding
and
the
per
diem
claims.
all
the
railroads
who
put
cars
on
our
line,
we
have
to
pay
it.
we
weren't
paying
but
their
claims
are
ahead
of
ours.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
their
administration
claims
that
you
can
find
all
of
that
at
page
181-a
because
the
commission
itself
set
it
out
and
put
a
value
on
it
and
made
a
chart
and
it
appeals
on
the
remand
report
and
it’s
at
page
181-a
of
the
appendix
of
decisions
of
constitutional
statutory
provisions
that
were
handed
up
with
our
briefs.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
somewhere
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
some
were
it
would
have
been
repossessed
and
some
have
excess
value
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
correct.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
that
what
happened
there
was
that.
we
have
maintained
those
throughout
the
administration
otherwise,
they
would
have
been
repossessed.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
therefore
although
they
were
debts
with
respect
to
those
railroad
costs
those
were
taken
over
when
the
cars
were
taken
over
by
penn
central
at
the
closing.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor
and
one
of
the
earlier
opinions
of
judge
friendly.
he
had
noted
that
of
course
if
you
were
going
to
predicate
some
kind
of
delay
then
you
couldn't
simply
predicate
the
delay
without
revaluing
the
assets
and
therefore
his
remand
in
the
first
instance
was
on
a
very
limited
ground.
he
had
asked
that
the
remand
be
on
limited
ground.
it
is
absolutely
unfair
however
we
may
entail
for
the
commission
to
stand
here
on
the
posture
and
saying
that
there
was
a
quantifying
of
risks
with
respect
to
that
bulk
sale.
if
you
read
the
commission's
report
you
will
see
that
everything
that
the
commission
has
to
say
about
the
success
under
a
single
title
limitations
on
the
right
to
break
up
the
railroad.
it
does,
there
was
no
question
of
quantifying
any
risks.
mr.
simon
did
not
know
for
example,
whether
the
appraisals
that
he
was
addressing
himself
to
had
been
made
on
a
very
conservative
basis
or
whether
they
have
been
made
on
the
generous
basis.
now,
obviously
if
you
make
it
on
a
generous
basis
then
you
have
got
to
worry
about
the
possibility
of
whether
it
would
be
completed
in
six
years
or
what
other
impacts
thereat.
mr.
simon
knew
nothing
about
that.
what
mr.
simon
said
and
it's
quoted
at
page
29
of
our
reply
brief
was,
“we
are
not
talking
today
of
about
uses
but
we
have
been
assuming
of
bulk
sale
and
we
have
been
discussing
about
the
decision
which
is
on
railroad’s
hands
as
to
whether
or
not
to
go
through
a
retail
process
themselves.”
and
he
says
also,
that
--
and
he
said
in
other
places
that
he
himself
did
not
study
the
appraisals.
he
simply
assumed
that
they
were
carefully
made.
if
he
didn't
know
what
the
commission
in
fact
said
about
and
that
was
that
they
were
conservative.
they
understood
the
possibility
that
there
was
10-year
liquidation
study
performed
with
a
7%
discount
as
against
the
six-year
liquidation
with
the
6%
discount
and
they
elected
that
but
you'd
have
to
imagine
the
most
remarkable
coincidence
that
precisely
the
profit
the
bulk
buyer
would
require
which
was
computed
on
the
basis
of
25%
of
his
own
invested
capital
giving
him
a
profit
of
15%
and
75%
borrowed
at
a
9%
rate
would
exactly
equal
the
risks
which
the
commission
had
somehow
overlooked.
obviously,
he
was
not
quantifying
any
of
those
risks
because
he
didn't
know
what
they
were
and
that
kind
of
coincidence
would
have
been
an
absolute
miracle.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
would
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
exactly,
your
honor.
the
inflationary
factor
alone
is
going
to
deprive
him
of
a
good
deal
of
a
risk.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
my
answer
however
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
in
the
first
part
was
subject
to
some
misinterpretation.
my
colleagues
inform
me
that
it
was
possible
to
interpret
my
answer's
meaning
but
penn
central
have
the
right
to
buy
in
50,000
share
blocks
from
us
and
in
that
way
we
lost
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
underwriting.
what
i
meant
was
this
that
at
any
time
they
could
pay
us
the
difference
between
what
the
value
of
the
shares
than
was
at
$87.50
and
be
free
of
the
underwriting.
now,
at
that
point
we
stood
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
anybody
else
who
bought
shares
of
stock.
if
we
were
stockholder,
if
we
kept
them,
we
kept
them
at
our
own
risk.
if
we
sold
them,
we
sold
them
on
our
own
risk.
and
there
was
layer
for
this
way
out
to
avoid
our
having
the
best
of
both
possible
worlds.
in
any
event,
that
i
would
say
is
this,
the
underwriting
saw
the
laces.
it
puts
us
off
so
far
ahead
1978.
it
gives
us
that
in
such
an
insecure
way.
that
might
be
an
enormous
bill
for
penn
central
to
pay.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
your
honor,
i
believe
we
went
into
--
i
would
say
that
the
commission
has
the
power
in
such
a
force
sale
as
this
and
i
would
say
that
this
was
never
a
reorganization
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
it
could
require
us
to
take
stock
in
all
likelihood
as
long
as
it
was
that
--
as
long
as
it
represented
the
cash
equivalent
of
what
they
gave
out.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
on
that
day.
i
think
that
that
far,
its
interest
in
--
that
far
it
had
a
right
to
protect
the
public
interest
by
seeing
that
it
did
not
so
burden
penn
central
in
the
form
of
a
payment.
i
don't
think
that
it
could
take
anything
away
from
the
bondholders
so
far
as
constitutional
rights
were
concerned.
but
so
far
as
protecting
penn
central
and
the
public
interest
in
the
form
of
a
payment,
as
long
as
it
gave
us
the
equivalent
of
what
we
were
asked,
i
think
to
that
extent
it
could
decide
what
the
form
of
the
security
should
be
and
we
never
complained
about
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
no,
your
honor
and
in
our
briefs
we
have
pointed
out
that
that
was
another
error
that
while
with
respect
to
our
real
estate
for
example,
every
selling
expense
was
deducted.
brokerage
fees,
lawyers’
fess,
the
expensive
advertising,
and
everything
else
in
order
to
get
down
to
out
net
salvage
value.
with
respect
to
the
shares
at
$83.1
million,
even
then
they
failed
to
take
it
into
account
our
selling
expenses
as
a
counter,
you
know,
in
order
to
keep
both
sides
of
the
equation
equitable
but
they
did
not
do
that.
on
the
harlem
river
yards
point,
i
would
like
to
say
this.
mr.
cox,
it
seems
to
me
is
still
suggesting
that
we
are
entitled
the
liquidation
value
on
something
less
than
our
best
method
of
liquidation.
both
--
there
were
two
witnesses
for
penn
central
on
the
harlem
river
yards
and
both
right
on
the
river.
penn
central
witnesses
testified
that
someone
would
provide
service
to
those
yards.
this
was
not
something
that
we
have
made
up.
the
only
question
is
where
it
is
clear
that
someone
would
provide
rail
service
to
those
yards
is
there
any
basis
in
law
for
valuing
and
for
finding
that
liquidation
value
on
something
less
than
fair
market
value
on
our
best
method
of
liquidation.
