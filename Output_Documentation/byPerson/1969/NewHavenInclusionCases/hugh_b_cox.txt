mr.
hugh
b.
cox
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
would
be
useful
to
the
court
if
that
very
beginning
i
stated
my
view
of
exactly
the
liquidation
valuation
process
of
the
commission
adopted
here
because
i
think
it's
possible
to
maybe
some
confusion
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
on
specific
points.
the
court
by
now
understands
of
course
that
the
new
haven
was
a
hopeless
railroad.
it
has
been
written
with
deficits
for
years
and
it
was
a
railroad
not
only
with
a
passenger
deficit
but
with
a
freight
deficit.
so,
if
you
value
this
railroad
on
any
conventional
basis,
earnings
or
goodwill
or
anything
of
that
kind
there
would
be
no
value
involved.
but
it
was
clear
to
me
reviewing
courts
as
i
think
that
my
client
would
have
to
concede
at
the
estate
and
the
bondholders
were
entitled
to
something.
they
were
entitled
to
a
fair
value,
so
that
the
only
standard
that
the
commission
could
apply
was
liquidation
value.
now
there
is
an
obvious
problem
there
because
this
railroad
is
never
going
to
be
liquidated.
the
penn
central
has
been
required
to
take
it
over
and
continue
the
rail
operations
and
to
absorb
indefinitely
the
deficits
of
those
operations
created.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
will
say
this
that
it's
the
only
standard
i
know
of
that
could
give
the
estate
and
bondholder
anything
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
i
would
suppose
that
if
it’s
not
certainly
they
are
entitled
to
something
under
the
statute
before
you
ever
get
to
the
constitution,
you
know.
and
certainly,
perhaps
by
the
constitution
if
there
is
a
liquidation
value
that
it
would
say
could
actually
obtain
by
selling
off
the
railroad
piece
by
piece
i
should
suppose
the
statute
before
you
get
to
the
constitution
would
say
that
the
commission
should
give
them
something
like
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
judge
friendly
said
in
his
opinion
that
this
gets
into
an
abstract
problem
which
i'd
rather
not
get
involve
in
but
judge
friendly
suggested
in
his
opinion
that
since
in
this
case
there
was
no
picking
in
a
real
sense
and
there
wasn’t.
my
client
is
in
the
position
it's
in
because
it
chose
to
do
something
and
so
is
the
new
haven.
judge
friendly
suggested
in
no
circumstances
that
perhaps
the
constitutional
rule
did
not
apply
but
to
stand
this
in
the
fairness
standard
would
require
that
something
like
liquidation
or
approaching
liquidation
value
but
the
reason
i
would
prefer
not
to
take
time
to
get
into
this
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
because
in
our
view
in
this
case,
the
commission
gave
these
people.
they
believe
the
value
that
they
would
get
in
this
hypothetical
liquidation
that
i'm
talking
about
if
the
conditions
are
realistically
appraised.
so,
that
whatever
the
standard
is
we
think
the
commission
meant
and
we
think
that's
what
the
commission
meant
to
do.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
yes
indeed!
but
of
course,
and
while
they
were
not
in
thriving
or
flourishing
condition
they
were
not
in
any
condition
as
the
new
haven.
they
had
net
deficits
in
their
railway
operating
income
but
particularly
the
then
old
pennsylvania
railroad
in
some
degree
that
the
new
york
central
had
other
sources
of
income
which
enable
them
to
pay
their
fixed
charges.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
surely
commission
has
determined,
yes.
that’s
the
--
that
was
the
basis
in
which
the
merger
of
the
two
lines
was
approved
and
also
the
basis
in
which
they
required
us
the
conditions
that
the
new
haven
be
included.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
should
not
speak
--
wish
to
speak
for
anyone
except
my
client
but
my
client
did
not
embrace
this
opportunity
to
the
edge.
would
it
preferred
not
to
take
the
new
haven,
they
were
required
to
if
they
wanted
the
merger
but
they
made
that
choice.
i'm
not
appealing
for
sympathy
for
the
penn
central
as
such
here
they
did
this
and
they
committed
themselves
to
pay
whatever
the
commission
and
the
courts
approved
as
their
term
and
that’s
where
we
are.
now
going
back
to
this
liquidation,
this
hypothetical
liquidation,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
it
involved.
it
meant
really
now
understand
that
the
commission
had
decide,
try
to
decide
what
prices
would
be
paid
by
people
who
were
never
going
to
buy
the
properties
that
were
never
be
sold.
they
didn't
necessarily
assume
that
it
will
be
broken
up,
some
of
it
might
be
sold
in
place
but
this
whole
thing
--
valuation
was
based
on
the
hypothetical
sanction
of
the
new
haven
which
stopped.
it
would
abandon
service,
would
necessarily
break
up
everything.
it
might
try
to
sell
some
things
in
place
but
it
would
stop
service
and
its
property
would
be
sold
off
piece
meal.
now
what,
in
our
view
that
commission
did
in
this
case
and
you
really
need
to
understand
what
it
did
was
to
have
to
go
back
and
looked
at
the
way
it
valued
all
the
different
kinds
of
properties
that
were
involved
here.
but
what
it
did
in
this
hypothetical
liquidation
was
to
try
so
far
as
it
could
to
bring
that
hypothetical
liquidation
close
to
what
would
in
fact,
have
happened
if
the
new
haven
had
liquidated,
had
abandoned
service
and
liquidated.
now,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
commission's
determination
that
there
should
be
an
allowance
for
abandonment
delaying.
it
makes
that
very
clear
in
a
passage
of
pages
that
occurs
in
its
report
about
page
146
of
that
printed
volume
of
the
first
appendix
because
the
commission’s
view
was
if
you
assume
there
was
going
to
be
a
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
and
you
have
to
assume
that.
if
you're
going
to
fix
this
liquidation
value,
it's
reasonable
to
say
assuming
that
we
will
give
them
a
certificate
so
that
they
can
abandon
nevertheless,
under
the
law,
and
this
is
true
they
have
to
ask
us
for
the
certificate.
we
can't
issue
it
immediately.
we're
required
to
give
notice
to
the
governor's
state.
we're
required
to
give
in
time
to
come
as
they
make
arguments
about
how
the
abandonment
should
be
conditioned
or
whether
the
sales
should
be
in
placed
or
as
junked,
any
other
problems
they
present
to
us,
we
have
to
listen
to
those
arguments,
hear
their
evidence
and
decide
it.
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
assuming
we'll
grant
a
certificate
and
assuming
that
the
new
haven
stops
operating
trains
which
the
commission
also
assumed.
we
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say
that
that
would
take
a
year
and
that
during
that
year
the
new
haven
would
incur
some
expenses
which
would
affect
the
liquidation
value
of
the
estate.
now,
that's
what
the
abandonment
allowance
delay
is
about
and
it's
all
that
it's
about.
the
suggestion
that
the
commission
could
prolong
it
indefinitely
i
think
you
can,
it
seems
to
me
need
not
obtain
this
very
long.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
so,
perhaps
they
would.
i
don't
know
but
they
didn't.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you're
talking
about
alice
in
wonderland.
i
think
what
the
commission
really
said
mr.
justice
stewart
is
this.
that
we
have
decided
that
it
would
take
six
years,
actually
to
sell
a
property
no
matter
when
you
start
it.
we
think
they
may
deserve
but
my
client
believes
they
made
a
very
serious
mistake
there
because
that
the
evidence
really
required
a
longer
period.
but
passing
that,
it
said
it
will
take
six
years
to
sell
the
property
but
before
you
can
start
selling
it
you
have
to
get
a
certificate.
so,
that
in
this,
in
the
real
sense
in
this
hypothetical
frame,
the
date
doesn't
make
too
much
difference.
they
didn't
the
first
time
say
six
years
from
so
and
so
would
be
the
liquidation
period.
they
just
said
six
years
whenever
you
started.
and
what
they
said,
what
the
commission
seems
to
me
to
be
finding
in
the
abandonment
delay
is
that
in
addition
to
taking
six
years
to
sell
it,
it's
going
to
need
another
year
to
get
the
position
to
start
selling
and
if
you
looked
at
it
completely
in
a
hypothetical
frame,
there’s
no
doubt
they
would
had
to
have
a
certificate.
there's
no
doubt
they
didn't
have
one.
now,
it's
true
they
say
it's
unfair
to
do
it
this
way.
you
should
pretend
that
we
have
a
certificate
because
we've
been
waiting
all
this
time
to
get
in
and
we've
been
suffering
all
these
losses.
now
mr.
goodman
has
just
dealt
that
and
he
said,
i
think
it's
simply
an
argument
about
how
this
pre-inclusion
lawsuit
should
be
dealt
with.
the
commission
dealt
with
that
as
to
the
68th
losses
and
all
the
courts
both
courts
below
sustained
it.
i
would
just
say
this
about
it
then
i
should
like
to
pass
on.
they
were
in
an
unfortunate
position.
they
bought
the
head
securities
and
deficit
written
railroad
and
the
trustees
without
any
objection
from
the
debtors
decided
to
try
to
become
and
be
included
in
the
penn
central
and
it
took
a
long
time
when
they
incurred
some
losses.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
white
i
have
to
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
so
far
as
they
issued
the
trustee’s
certificates.
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
they
are.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
there
have
been
some
figures
cost
about
here
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
but
i
can't
analyze
those
figures
because
i
don't
know
what
they
are
but
it's
quite
true
that
any
amounts
represented
by
the
trustee’s
certificates
would
be
ahead
of
the
bondholders
and
of
course,
they've
been
incurring
deficits
since
1956
quite
long
and
since
they
--
ever
since
they've
been
in
receivership.
but
if
you
are
applying
a
liquidation
stand
which
requires
a
hypothetical
liquidation
and
that’s
what
is
giving
them
out
of
the
commission’s
decision
$146
or
$150
million
when
any
other
way
they
would
get
nothing.
my
suggestion
is
that
it
ought
to
be
applied
consistently,
they've
embraced
it
and
they
really
shouldn't
complain
on
it
when
it
hurts.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
the
first
time
they
did
so
was
in
the
spring
in
1967.
it
was
not
so
much
in
the
form
of
objection
to
inclusion
as
it
was
but
it
was
a
suggestion
that
reorganization
proceedings
should
be
terminated.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
liquidate,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh!
yes
and
i
think
that
it
was
only
one
group
of
them
that
made
the
suggestion
about
not
to
declare
about
terminating
proceedings
but
they
participated
in
the
inclusion
proceedings
but
largely
to
in
the
interest
of
increasing
the
price.
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do.
and
this
--
if
you
begin
to
look
at
this
problem
in
terms
of
who
suffered
most,
you
try
to
decide
how
this
liquidation
hypothesis
should
be
applied
by
appealing
to
sympathy
as
they're
looking
at
the
merits
of
the
particular
methods
the
court
used,
i
think
you
then
some
other
considerations
to
come
into
play
which
i
would
be
obliged
to
mention
in
the
court.
they
are
penn
central
of
course,
whatever
loss
that
this
people
has
suffered
penn
central
is
required
to
suffer
these
losses
in
indefinite
future
and
what
is
more
that
is
not
something.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
unless
they
can
get
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
commission
is
going
to
allow
them
to
abandon
the
freight
service
and
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
on
the
passenger
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
inclusion
they've
lost
at
least
they've
not
received
about
$4
and
a
half
million
that
the
state
used
to
give
the
new
haven.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
was
the
commission,
yes.
that
was
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
agreed
to
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
simply
apply
the
same
formula
but
to
one
year.
see,
that
formula
was
assumed
that
it
would
be
three
years
before
they
would
be
included
and
there
was
a
maximum
under
the
formula
that
five
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
as
matter
of
objections
but
i
think
the
suggestion
was
left
this
morning
at
the
commission
modified
his
formula
it
didn't
really
--
it
was
always
a
maximum
of
$5
million
a
year
and
that's
what
the
pennsylvania
paid
for
$68.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
prorated
over
11
months.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
i
think
this
--
the
thing
that
the
--
the
next
thing
i
should
like
to
say
something
about
is
the
so-called
bulk
sale
discount.
i
think
there's
been
some
confusion
about
it,
too.
that
determination
of
the
commission
does
not
assume
a
bulk
sale.
it
doesn't
assume
a
bulk
purchaser,
it
simply
a
method
that
the
commission
used
based
on
the
testimony
of
an
expert
witness.
a
method
that
the
commission
used
to
value
the
real
property
of
the
new
haven
as
of
valuation
date
on
the
assumption
that
that
real
property
was
going
to
be
sold
piece
meal
over
six
years.
that's
all
that
determination
of
the
commission’s
amounted
to
was
this
witness
who
was
an
experienced
in
real
estate
investor
and
administrator
testified
that
if
he
were
going
to
value
it,
this
$3000
parcels
of
property
that
the
new
haven
had
as
of
the
valuation
date,
he
would
go
about
it
in
a
particular
way
and
they
way
he
went
about
it
was
making
some
computations
about
the
amount
of
capital
that
would
be
involved
in
the
venture.
he
said
75%
mortgage
capital
at
9%,
25%
equity
capital
at
15%,
and
by
applying
those
rates
of
retiring
to
the
cash
flow
proceeds
using
the
same
appraisals
that
the
new
haven
people
have
made
and
assuming
a
six-year
liquidation
of
the
same
way
the
new
haven
people
did.
he
arrived
at
a
figure
which
he
thought
represented
the
value
of
that
amounts
of
real
property
as
of
the
valuation
date
at
the
end
of
1966.
now,
the
commission
took
his
testimony
and
did
a
little
different
way.
they
took
away
that
average
and
got
10-1/2%
as
applied
really
instead
of
the
6%.
so,
what
this
issue
about
the
bulk
sale
discount
really
comes
down
to
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
commission
should
have
discounted
the
real
properties
of
the
new
haven
for
the
purpose
of
determining
valuation
of
the
valuation
date
by
6%
as
it
did
the
first
time
or
by
10-1/2%
as
he
did
the
second
time
on
the
basis
of
his
testimony.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
what
was
called
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
a
money
discount.
it
was
based
on
the
prior
rate
of
interest
and
represented
merely
the
difference
between
having
the
money
now
and
having
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that's--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
clear
on
the
record
and
we've
developed
that
in
our
brief.
that
was
simply
6%
represent
the
difference
between
having
money
now
and
having
six
years
from
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
not
in
my
view
mr.
justice
stewart.
that's
the
channery
point
and
i
better
say
something
about
that
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
this
judgment
as
i
think
mr.
goodman
said
about
how
to
value
properties
was
essentially
a
business
or
economic
judgment
and
what
the
commission
was
saying
was
we
think
the
best
method
of
determining
liquidation
value
of
the
real
estate
or
reasonable
method
is
to
do
it
as
the
way
that
mr.
simon’s
testimony
has
demonstrated
it
could
be
done.
now,
the
bondholders
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
constitutional
law,
they
said
they
were
entitled
to
have
liquidation
value
determined
by
a
particular
method.
in
other
words,
they
said,
the
only
way
you
can
do
it
under
the
constitution
is
to
take
these
individual
appraisals,
put
them
all
together
and
maybe
you
can
apply
the
6%
discount
but
if
you
do
anything
beside
that
you
have
departed
from
the
constitutional
standard.
now,
the
commission
responded
to
that
argument
and
that's
what
all
is
this
discussion
is
about
how
and
what
they
could
do
in
the
abandonment
proceeding
the
commission
responded
to
that
argument
by
saying
there’s
nothing
in
this
broad
constitutional
purpose
in
our
argument
because
in
some
circumstances
we
could
require
you
to
sell
them
to
both
purchaser
who
was
going
to
continue
the
railroad
operation.
well,
i
think
the
worst
and
judge
friendly
expressed
some
doubts
about
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
somewhat
less
than
collusive
--
it's
collusive
enough
i
think
when
you
read
the
whole
thing
with
a
view
of
determining
whether
there’s
any
internal
consistency
but
my
position
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
attributed
to
it
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
attributes
to
it
the
same
meaning
i'm
attributing
to
it.
it
was
an
economic
--
it
was
essentially
an
economic
judgment
and
didn't
depend
on
legal
reason.
i
think
the
commission
may
have
given
dubious
or
more
involved
answer
to
this
argument
and
it
needed
to
be
given
i
should
thought
it
could
have
answered
simply
by
saying
that
you,
you
maybe
entitled
the
liquidation
value
but
we're
entitled
to
determine
liquidation
value
by
any
reasonable
method
that
it
has
support
any
evidence
and
this
method
does
but
instead
of
that
the
commission
value
to
this
discussion
about
what
it
could
or
could
not
do
in
an
abandonment
proceeding.
now,
there's
no
--
i
submit
you
look
at
that
report
and
consider
that
the
commission
was
dealing
with
an
economic
business
problem
on
how
to
value
property
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
its’
judgment
on
any
economic
issue
would
be
a
total
effective
if
it
we’re
told
that
there
may
be
some
doubt
or
even
when
it
was
wrong
about
the
legal
answer
it
gave
to
the
bondholders
argument.
i
think
that
economic
determination
can
stand
on
its
own
foot.
this
is
really
stronger
case
than
the
massachusetts
investors
company
case
was
because
there
they
chose
the
wrong
authority
or
two
statutes.
here
i
think
they
simply
possibly
gave
the
wrong
answer
to
an
argument
that
could
have
been
disposed
of
on
temporary.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
end
of
the
valuation
date,
the
end
of
january
--
of
december
1966.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
let
me
tell
you
how
that
was
done,
mr.
justice
white.
new
haven
first
broke
to
land
up
in
these
3,000
parcels.
they
then
had
3,000
as
i
understand
at
separate
appraisals
made
and
those
appraisals
did
not
take
into
account
the
problem
of
market
absorption
or
how
long
it
would
take
the
ceremony
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
or
sold
one
it
separately
at
or
about
that
time.
i
thought
they
sought
some
reasonable
exposure
to
market
but
after
the
appraisals
were
made,
then
a
witness
of
new
haven
came
along
and
examined
would
not
make
the
appraisals
but
he
examined
and
he
said,
well,
you
obviously
can't
sell
all
these
properties
at
once.
i
think
it
would
take
at
least
six
years.
i
think
even
that
witness
admitted
that
was
an
optimistic
estimate
and
of
course
my
clients
said.
and
one
of
the
new
haven's
witnesses
said
that
if
you
couldn't
it
in
six
years.
ten
years
about
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
but
you
didn't
have
it
because
these
appraisals
did
not
take
that
into
account.
this
is
all
and
i
think
you
can
read
our
brief
on
and
i
don't
believe
it
can
really
be
disputed
and
be
contested.
what
the
head
done,
the
only
thing
they've
done
was
as
to
certain
specific
pieces
of
property
they
had
applied
what
was
called
the
cats
and
dogs
discount.
they
may
indulge
us
as
to
certain
particular
parcels.
now,
the
witness
simon
took
that
into
account
and
he
said
even
with
that
he
would
use
this
method
of
valuing
the
property
which
produced
the
10-1/2%
discount
the
commission
used
but
the
cats
and
dogs
discount
was
confined
to
certain
particular
pieces
of
property
which
had
known
infirmities
at
the
time
the
appraisals
were
made.
it
really
didn't
look
to
the
future
risks
at
all.
there
are
--
the
risks
of
perhaps
covering
--
appearing
to
be
rather
disjointed
in
this
presentation
i
should
now
like
to
touch
briefly
on
some
of
the
points
that
come
up
in
respect
to
other
aspects
of
the
case
one
of
them
being
the
situation
these
two
yards
in
the
bronx.
i
hope
that
the
court
is
clear
that
the
question
in
there
is
the
--
really
come
to
down
to
appraisal
of
the
evidence
over
whether
some
railroad
in
the
event
of
the
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
which
served
these
two
new
haven
yards
and
the
bronx.
it's
those
two
yards
that
are
in
issue.
now,
the
commission
took
an
appraisal
which
was
made
on
the
assumption
that
the
new
haven
would
abandon
service.
the
bondholders
say
that
the
commission
was
bound
to
take
a
higher
appraisal
which
the
appraisers
said
would
only
apply
if
you
assume
that
some
railroad
other
than
the
new
haven
applied
or
supplied
the
same
service
to
new
haven
supplied
so
that
on
a
hearing
that
it
became
an
argument
over
whether
the
penn
central
would
voluntarily
or
could
be
compelled
to
serve
these
two
yards.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
know
the
map.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that’s
a
map
if
it
shows
the
lines
running
--
it
shows
two
lines
over
on
the
left
run
down,
a
little
down
in
harlem
river
and
yellow
line
going
across.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
what's
that?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
these
two
lines
over
in
the
left
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
are
now
are
all
new
york
central
lines.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
and
the
yellow
line
was
at
new
york
central
branch
which
ran
down
to
the
former
port
morris
yard
in
new
york
central
and
then
to
an
interchange
point
with
the
new
haven
and
any
traffic
that
the
new
york
central
moved
to
this
area
was
--
of
to
these
yards
or
to
the
hunts
point
market
was
interchanged
at
this
point.
now,
the
commission
heard
this
evidence
and
having
heard
it
found
that
on
all
facts
that
if
the
new
haven
were
liquidated
which
is
the
hypothesis
that
we're
considering,
the
penn
central
would
not
serve
these
yards
and
could
not
be
compelled
and
the
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
length
we
think
that
finding
was
fully
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence.
i
just
want
to
say
one
word
about
however
to
make
one
point
clear.
the
reorganization
court
took
the
view
that
the
penn
central
could
be
compelled
as
new
haven
were
liquidated
to
serve
that
market
operated
by
the
city
of
new
york.
the
commission
found
to
the
contrary
because
that
traffic
is
highly
unprofitable
but
even
if
that
it
is
assumed
and
this
is
the
point
i'd
like
to
make,
even
if
it's
assumed
that
the
penn
central
might
serve
that
hunts
point
vegetable
market
or
might
be
compelled
to
it
doesn’t
follow
that
it
would
serve
either
of
these
other
two
yards.
that's
--
their
only
the
evidence
showed
that
on
average
it
were
only
about
13
cars
a
day
went
to
those
yards
to
serve
them.
penn
central
would
either
have
to
buy
from
the
new
haven
in
liquidation
or
somebody
else
tracks
facilities
which
would
be
extremely
expansive
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
traffic
would
not
be
profitable
anyway
and
furthermore
the
evidence
shows
that
it
would
incur
very
substantial
operating
cost
for
the
purpose
of
this
small
volume
of
profit.
now,
as
far
as
the
suggestion
if
they
could
be
compelled
to
serve
them,
the
commission
disposed
to
that
by
examining
the
facts
and
saying
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
need
for
service
to
these
two
yards
or
of
that
the
hunts
point
market
for
that
matter
that
would
justify
requiring
service
in
the
public
interest
and
of
course
the
commission
would
have
to
make
a
contrary
finding
in
order
to
require
our
service.
so,
i
think
that
looking
at
that
whole
situation
it
is
quite
clear
that
your
mission
is
determination
there
which
required
which
is
dependent
upon
evidence
as
to
what
the
operating
conditions
were,
and
also
relied
to
all
of
the
commission’s
own
judgment
about
what
the
transportation
needs
were
should
clearly
be
sustained.
i
may
add
that
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
those
evidence
before
the
commission
of
the
new
haven
itself
sold
a
large
chunk,
one
of
these
yards
at
exactly
the
square
foot
price
that
was
in
the
appraisal
the
commission
adopted
which
was
50
cents
of
square
foot
lower
than
the
price
on
the
appraisal
that
the
bondholders
now
say
the
commission
was
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
adopt
so
that
i
think
it
is,
if
they
were,
we
have
a
remand
on
this
question
that
the
commission
might
have
to
have
another
look
at
the
whole
question
of
evaluation.
i
find
my
time
is
nearing
the
end.
i
should
like
to
say
something
about
this
issue
of
stock
because
i
think
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicate
that
there's
something
that
perhaps
that
should
be
said
about
it.
the
commission
in
treating
the
stock
issue
picks
an
inherent
value
where
this
stock
that
is
going
to
be
delivered
on
the
closing
date.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
was
a
determination
that
the
stock
would
have
that
value
in
itself
even
though
it
might
not
command
a
price
on
the
stock
market
as
of
the
particular
date
it
was
equal
to
value.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
he
has
to
keep
it
until
he
can
get
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
but
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
plan.
now
the
reason
i
think
if
you
think
about
the
situation
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
look,
mr.
justice
white,
they
were
not
going
to
use
this
money.
that
wasn't
it
and
we’re
going
to
put
this
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
new
haven.
they
were
going
to
put
the
stock
in
an
investment
company
and
keep
it
for
seven
years
and
the
reason
they
were
going
to
do
that
it
was
because
everyone
knew
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
merger.
at
the
beginning
of
this
merger
the
market
price
of
the
stock
wasn't
going
to
reflect
what
is
was
really
worth
over
any
period
of
time.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
not
arguing
a
stock
owned
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
commission,
i'm
saying
two
things.
i
think
the
commission
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind
involving
a
reorganization
of
railroad
is
entitled
so
long
as
it
has
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
to
determine
a
value
of
stock
that
is
in
inherent
rather
than
a
value
that
is
evidenced
by
a
current
market
quotation.
and
that
is
so
even
if
it
maybe
some
time
depending
upon
such
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
say
you
can
give
it
to
them
if
they
in
stock
that
has
an
inherent
value
on
that
date.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
can
--
i
think
it's
an
essential
part
of
the
power
the
commission
has
to
have
in
hearing
with
the
reorganization
of
this
kind
because
frequently
they
don’t
know
what
the
stock
would
be
worth.
in
terms
by
--
judge
by
stock
market
quotations,
they
know
what
they
can
determine
what's
inherent
valuing.
now,
of
course,
in
the
courts
below
it
took
care
of
those
problems
as
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
white.
money
is
different.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
reorganization,
and
i
think
you
could
find
this
concept
--
in
reorganization
when
you
give
stock
you’re
giving
what
amounts
to
an
equity
in
a
growing
concern.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
mind
you
they're
not
rejecting
stock.
they
want
stock.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
can't
answer
that
question.
all
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
all
i
can
say
is
that
they
have
indicated
they
want
stock
and
some
of
the
bondholders
have
said
that
they
want
more
stock
than
as
opposed
to
bonds.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
because
they
--
as
the
junior
bondholders,
they
are
only
hoping
this
thing
as
really
to
have
that
stock
go
up
in
value
so
that
they
can
have
something
out
of
it
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
that's
what
they
really
want,
yes
and
they
never
have
taken
that
position.
this
payment
of
this
large
amount
of
the
consideration
in
stock
is
something
that's
been
in
this
plan
from
the
very
beginning
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
bondholders
have
never
insisted
it
more
than
it
should
paid
in
that
bond.
now,
they
have
to
ask
occasional
times
to
make
up
differences
between
a
market
value
but
the
notion
of
getting
a
large
equity
position
in
this
new
company
has
been
in
this
thing
from
the
very
beginning
and
as
far
as
i
know
it’s
not
been
objected
to
by
anybody.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no
one
could
--
the
penn
central
wouldn't
have
that
money
and
they
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you
can’t
blame
that
on
anyone
except
to
possibly
penn
central
but
the
notion,
the
distinction
between
a
market
quotation
and
inherent
value
is
not
a
noble
distinction
in
the
law.
you
looked
at
the
valuation
cases
under
the
appraisal
cases
they're
infrequent
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
get
something
that
is
in
a
--
i
submit
it's
the
worst
stuff.
now,
they're
going
to
have
to
wait
a
little
while
to
get
it.
they
may
have
to
wait
seven
years.
in
the
meantime,
they
got
an
underwriting.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
judge
anderson.
it
was
taken
by
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
and
accepted
by
the
commission.
so
that
is
now
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
of
course,
any
modifications
in
that
underwriting
which
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
because
it
involves
this
problem
under
section
28.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
they
are
allocating
any
burden
on
the
bondholders.
i
think
they've
given
the
bondholders
my
judgment
more
than
the
bondholders
would
get
if
they
really
broke
up
this
railroad
and
sold
it.
i
think
the
real
problem
is
that
the
penn
central
has
been
required
to
absorb
these
deficits
and
pay
a
price
that
my
client
believes
is
too
high
for
real
liquidation
value
and
the
end
is
not
going
to
come
--
the
effect
is
not
going
to
stop
the
equity
at
penn
central
come.
this
is
going
to
affect
the
rate
based
that
caused
the
ratemaking
power
of
the
commission
and
the
viability
and
the
vitality
of
penn
central
is
that
the
transportation
company
and
this
transportation
service
that’s
available
to
shippers
all
over
the
organized
states.
that's
why
the
commission
has
authority
over
securities
so
that
the
capital
structure
can't
be
inflated.
now,
at
the
end
of
our
brief
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
can't
do
that
of
course
under
the
law
of
the
constitution
and
you
have
to
give
them
at
least
we’re
operating
on
the
assumption
they
have
to
get
the
liquidation
value.
when
we
think
they
got
it
in
a
little
bit
more.
they
got
$8
million
for
a
building
that’s
never
going
to
be
built
over
at
grand
central
terminal,
that
we
think
was
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it's
very
doubtful.
i
say
never
is
too
strong
a
word,
i
was
carried
away
by
the
acts
of
enthusiasm
--[laughter]
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
there
is
great
doubt
that
it's
going
to
be
built.
they
got
$6
million
because
the
commission
overlooked.
they
forgot
or
disregarded
the
evidence
about
how
the
cost
of
the
terminal
in
the
point
to
the
brief.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
the
figures
of
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
whatever
it
is.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
comes
in
the
first
instance
from
the
penn
central
and
ultimately
it's
going
to
come
from
the
pockets
of
the
people
who
pay
rates.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
just
would
want
to
say
one
thing.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
the
litigation.
i
just
wish
to
say
the
court
on
this
question,
free
use
of
the
grand
central
terminal
that
as
we
read
the
briefs
in
states
they
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
haven't
paid
penn
central
anything
for
the
use
of
their
making
that
terminal.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that
step
provides
for
the
investment
company
in
seven
years
and
how
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
not
before
you
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
would
be
useful
to
the
court
if
that
very
beginning
i
stated
my
view
of
exactly
the
liquidation
valuation
process
of
the
commission
adopted
here
because
i
think
it's
possible
to
maybe
some
confusion
as
a
result
of
the
discussion
on
specific
points.
the
court
by
now
understands
of
course
that
the
new
haven
was
a
hopeless
railroad.
it
has
been
written
with
deficits
for
years
and
it
was
a
railroad
not
only
with
a
passenger
deficit
but
with
a
freight
deficit.
so,
if
you
value
this
railroad
on
any
conventional
basis,
earnings
or
goodwill
or
anything
of
that
kind
there
would
be
no
value
involved.
but
it
was
clear
to
me
reviewing
courts
as
i
think
that
my
client
would
have
to
concede
at
the
estate
and
the
bondholders
were
entitled
to
something.
they
were
entitled
to
a
fair
value,
so
that
the
only
standard
that
the
commission
could
apply
was
liquidation
value.
now
there
is
an
obvious
problem
there
because
this
railroad
is
never
going
to
be
liquidated.
the
penn
central
has
been
required
to
take
it
over
and
continue
the
rail
operations
and
to
absorb
indefinitely
the
deficits
of
those
operations
created.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
will
say
this
that
it's
the
only
standard
i
know
of
that
could
give
the
estate
and
bondholder
anything
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
i
would
suppose
that
if
it’s
not
certainly
they
are
entitled
to
something
under
the
statute
before
you
ever
get
to
the
constitution,
you
know.
and
certainly,
perhaps
by
the
constitution
if
there
is
a
liquidation
value
that
it
would
say
could
actually
obtain
by
selling
off
the
railroad
piece
by
piece
i
should
suppose
the
statute
before
you
get
to
the
constitution
would
say
that
the
commission
should
give
them
something
like
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
judge
friendly
said
in
his
opinion
that
this
gets
into
an
abstract
problem
which
i'd
rather
not
get
involve
in
but
judge
friendly
suggested
in
his
opinion
that
since
in
this
case
there
was
no
picking
in
a
real
sense
and
there
wasn’t.
my
client
is
in
the
position
it's
in
because
it
chose
to
do
something
and
so
is
the
new
haven.
judge
friendly
suggested
in
no
circumstances
that
perhaps
the
constitutional
rule
did
not
apply
but
to
stand
this
in
the
fairness
standard
would
require
that
something
like
liquidation
or
approaching
liquidation
value
but
the
reason
i
would
prefer
not
to
take
time
to
get
into
this
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
because
in
our
view
in
this
case,
the
commission
gave
these
people.
they
believe
the
value
that
they
would
get
in
this
hypothetical
liquidation
that
i'm
talking
about
if
the
conditions
are
realistically
appraised.
so,
that
whatever
the
standard
is
we
think
the
commission
meant
and
we
think
that's
what
the
commission
meant
to
do.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
yes
indeed!
but
of
course,
and
while
they
were
not
in
thriving
or
flourishing
condition
they
were
not
in
any
condition
as
the
new
haven.
they
had
net
deficits
in
their
railway
operating
income
but
particularly
the
then
old
pennsylvania
railroad
in
some
degree
that
the
new
york
central
had
other
sources
of
income
which
enable
them
to
pay
their
fixed
charges.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
surely
commission
has
determined,
yes.
that’s
the
--
that
was
the
basis
in
which
the
merger
of
the
two
lines
was
approved
and
also
the
basis
in
which
they
required
us
the
conditions
that
the
new
haven
be
included.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
should
not
speak
--
wish
to
speak
for
anyone
except
my
client
but
my
client
did
not
embrace
this
opportunity
to
the
edge.
would
it
preferred
not
to
take
the
new
haven,
they
were
required
to
if
they
wanted
the
merger
but
they
made
that
choice.
i'm
not
appealing
for
sympathy
for
the
penn
central
as
such
here
they
did
this
and
they
committed
themselves
to
pay
whatever
the
commission
and
the
courts
approved
as
their
term
and
that’s
where
we
are.
now
going
back
to
this
liquidation,
this
hypothetical
liquidation,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
it
involved.
it
meant
really
now
understand
that
the
commission
had
decide,
try
to
decide
what
prices
would
be
paid
by
people
who
were
never
going
to
buy
the
properties
that
were
never
be
sold.
they
didn't
necessarily
assume
that
it
will
be
broken
up,
some
of
it
might
be
sold
in
place
but
this
whole
thing
--
valuation
was
based
on
the
hypothetical
sanction
of
the
new
haven
which
stopped.
it
would
abandon
service,
would
necessarily
break
up
everything.
it
might
try
to
sell
some
things
in
place
but
it
would
stop
service
and
its
property
would
be
sold
off
piece
meal.
now
what,
in
our
view
that
commission
did
in
this
case
and
you
really
need
to
understand
what
it
did
was
to
have
to
go
back
and
looked
at
the
way
it
valued
all
the
different
kinds
of
properties
that
were
involved
here.
but
what
it
did
in
this
hypothetical
liquidation
was
to
try
so
far
as
it
could
to
bring
that
hypothetical
liquidation
close
to
what
would
in
fact,
have
happened
if
the
new
haven
had
liquidated,
had
abandoned
service
and
liquidated.
now,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
commission's
determination
that
there
should
be
an
allowance
for
abandonment
delaying.
it
makes
that
very
clear
in
a
passage
of
pages
that
occurs
in
its
report
about
page
146
of
that
printed
volume
of
the
first
appendix
because
the
commission’s
view
was
if
you
assume
there
was
going
to
be
a
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
and
you
have
to
assume
that.
if
you're
going
to
fix
this
liquidation
value,
it's
reasonable
to
say
assuming
that
we
will
give
them
a
certificate
so
that
they
can
abandon
nevertheless,
under
the
law,
and
this
is
true
they
have
to
ask
us
for
the
certificate.
we
can't
issue
it
immediately.
we're
required
to
give
notice
to
the
governor's
state.
we're
required
to
give
in
time
to
come
as
they
make
arguments
about
how
the
abandonment
should
be
conditioned
or
whether
the
sales
should
be
in
placed
or
as
junked,
any
other
problems
they
present
to
us,
we
have
to
listen
to
those
arguments,
hear
their
evidence
and
decide
it.
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
assuming
we'll
grant
a
certificate
and
assuming
that
the
new
haven
stops
operating
trains
which
the
commission
also
assumed.
we
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say
that
that
would
take
a
year
and
that
during
that
year
the
new
haven
would
incur
some
expenses
which
would
affect
the
liquidation
value
of
the
estate.
now,
that's
what
the
abandonment
allowance
delay
is
about
and
it's
all
that
it's
about.
the
suggestion
that
the
commission
could
prolong
it
indefinitely
i
think
you
can,
it
seems
to
me
need
not
obtain
this
very
long.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
so,
perhaps
they
would.
i
don't
know
but
they
didn't.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you're
talking
about
alice
in
wonderland.
i
think
what
the
commission
really
said
mr.
justice
stewart
is
this.
that
we
have
decided
that
it
would
take
six
years,
actually
to
sell
a
property
no
matter
when
you
start
it.
we
think
they
may
deserve
but
my
client
believes
they
made
a
very
serious
mistake
there
because
that
the
evidence
really
required
a
longer
period.
but
passing
that,
it
said
it
will
take
six
years
to
sell
the
property
but
before
you
can
start
selling
it
you
have
to
get
a
certificate.
so,
that
in
this,
in
the
real
sense
in
this
hypothetical
frame,
the
date
doesn't
make
too
much
difference.
they
didn't
the
first
time
say
six
years
from
so
and
so
would
be
the
liquidation
period.
they
just
said
six
years
whenever
you
started.
and
what
they
said,
what
the
commission
seems
to
me
to
be
finding
in
the
abandonment
delay
is
that
in
addition
to
taking
six
years
to
sell
it,
it's
going
to
need
another
year
to
get
the
position
to
start
selling
and
if
you
looked
at
it
completely
in
a
hypothetical
frame,
there’s
no
doubt
they
would
had
to
have
a
certificate.
there's
no
doubt
they
didn't
have
one.
now,
it's
true
they
say
it's
unfair
to
do
it
this
way.
you
should
pretend
that
we
have
a
certificate
because
we've
been
waiting
all
this
time
to
get
in
and
we've
been
suffering
all
these
losses.
now
mr.
goodman
has
just
dealt
that
and
he
said,
i
think
it's
simply
an
argument
about
how
this
pre-inclusion
lawsuit
should
be
dealt
with.
the
commission
dealt
with
that
as
to
the
68th
losses
and
all
the
courts
both
courts
below
sustained
it.
i
would
just
say
this
about
it
then
i
should
like
to
pass
on.
they
were
in
an
unfortunate
position.
they
bought
the
head
securities
and
deficit
written
railroad
and
the
trustees
without
any
objection
from
the
debtors
decided
to
try
to
become
and
be
included
in
the
penn
central
and
it
took
a
long
time
when
they
incurred
some
losses.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
white
i
have
to
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
so
far
as
they
issued
the
trustee’s
certificates.
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
they
are.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
there
have
been
some
figures
cost
about
here
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
but
i
can't
analyze
those
figures
because
i
don't
know
what
they
are
but
it's
quite
true
that
any
amounts
represented
by
the
trustee’s
certificates
would
be
ahead
of
the
bondholders
and
of
course,
they've
been
incurring
deficits
since
1956
quite
long
and
since
they
--
ever
since
they've
been
in
receivership.
but
if
you
are
applying
a
liquidation
stand
which
requires
a
hypothetical
liquidation
and
that’s
what
is
giving
them
out
of
the
commission’s
decision
$146
or
$150
million
when
any
other
way
they
would
get
nothing.
my
suggestion
is
that
it
ought
to
be
applied
consistently,
they've
embraced
it
and
they
really
shouldn't
complain
on
it
when
it
hurts.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
the
first
time
they
did
so
was
in
the
spring
in
1967.
it
was
not
so
much
in
the
form
of
objection
to
inclusion
as
it
was
but
it
was
a
suggestion
that
reorganization
proceedings
should
be
terminated.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
liquidate,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh!
yes
and
i
think
that
it
was
only
one
group
of
them
that
made
the
suggestion
about
not
to
declare
about
terminating
proceedings
but
they
participated
in
the
inclusion
proceedings
but
largely
to
in
the
interest
of
increasing
the
price.
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do.
and
this
--
if
you
begin
to
look
at
this
problem
in
terms
of
who
suffered
most,
you
try
to
decide
how
this
liquidation
hypothesis
should
be
applied
by
appealing
to
sympathy
as
they're
looking
at
the
merits
of
the
particular
methods
the
court
used,
i
think
you
then
some
other
considerations
to
come
into
play
which
i
would
be
obliged
to
mention
in
the
court.
they
are
penn
central
of
course,
whatever
loss
that
this
people
has
suffered
penn
central
is
required
to
suffer
these
losses
in
indefinite
future
and
what
is
more
that
is
not
something.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
unless
they
can
get
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
commission
is
going
to
allow
them
to
abandon
the
freight
service
and
nobody
knows
what
will
happen
on
the
passenger
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
inclusion
they've
lost
at
least
they've
not
received
about
$4
and
a
half
million
that
the
state
used
to
give
the
new
haven.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
was
the
commission,
yes.
that
was
the
commission
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
agreed
to
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
simply
apply
the
same
formula
but
to
one
year.
see,
that
formula
was
assumed
that
it
would
be
three
years
before
they
would
be
included
and
there
was
a
maximum
under
the
formula
that
five
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
as
matter
of
objections
but
i
think
the
suggestion
was
left
this
morning
at
the
commission
modified
his
formula
it
didn't
really
--
it
was
always
a
maximum
of
$5
million
a
year
and
that's
what
the
pennsylvania
paid
for
$68.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
prorated
over
11
months.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
now,
i
think
this
--
the
thing
that
the
--
the
next
thing
i
should
like
to
say
something
about
is
the
so-called
bulk
sale
discount.
i
think
there's
been
some
confusion
about
it,
too.
that
determination
of
the
commission
does
not
assume
a
bulk
sale.
it
doesn't
assume
a
bulk
purchaser,
it
simply
a
method
that
the
commission
used
based
on
the
testimony
of
an
expert
witness.
a
method
that
the
commission
used
to
value
the
real
property
of
the
new
haven
as
of
valuation
date
on
the
assumption
that
that
real
property
was
going
to
be
sold
piece
meal
over
six
years.
that's
all
that
determination
of
the
commission’s
amounted
to
was
this
witness
who
was
an
experienced
in
real
estate
investor
and
administrator
testified
that
if
he
were
going
to
value
it,
this
$3000
parcels
of
property
that
the
new
haven
had
as
of
the
valuation
date,
he
would
go
about
it
in
a
particular
way
and
they
way
he
went
about
it
was
making
some
computations
about
the
amount
of
capital
that
would
be
involved
in
the
venture.
he
said
75%
mortgage
capital
at
9%,
25%
equity
capital
at
15%,
and
by
applying
those
rates
of
retiring
to
the
cash
flow
proceeds
using
the
same
appraisals
that
the
new
haven
people
have
made
and
assuming
a
six-year
liquidation
of
the
same
way
the
new
haven
people
did.
he
arrived
at
a
figure
which
he
thought
represented
the
value
of
that
amounts
of
real
property
as
of
the
valuation
date
at
the
end
of
1966.
now,
the
commission
took
his
testimony
and
did
a
little
different
way.
they
took
away
that
average
and
got
10-1/2%
as
applied
really
instead
of
the
6%.
so,
what
this
issue
about
the
bulk
sale
discount
really
comes
down
to
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
commission
should
have
discounted
the
real
properties
of
the
new
haven
for
the
purpose
of
determining
valuation
of
the
valuation
date
by
6%
as
it
did
the
first
time
or
by
10-1/2%
as
he
did
the
second
time
on
the
basis
of
his
testimony.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
what
was
called
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white
a
money
discount.
it
was
based
on
the
prior
rate
of
interest
and
represented
merely
the
difference
between
having
the
money
now
and
having
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that's--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
clear
on
the
record
and
we've
developed
that
in
our
brief.
that
was
simply
6%
represent
the
difference
between
having
money
now
and
having
six
years
from
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
not
in
my
view
mr.
justice
stewart.
that's
the
channery
point
and
i
better
say
something
about
that
now.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
this
judgment
as
i
think
mr.
goodman
said
about
how
to
value
properties
was
essentially
a
business
or
economic
judgment
and
what
the
commission
was
saying
was
we
think
the
best
method
of
determining
liquidation
value
of
the
real
estate
or
reasonable
method
is
to
do
it
as
the
way
that
mr.
simon’s
testimony
has
demonstrated
it
could
be
done.
now,
the
bondholders
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
constitutional
law,
they
said
they
were
entitled
to
have
liquidation
value
determined
by
a
particular
method.
in
other
words,
they
said,
the
only
way
you
can
do
it
under
the
constitution
is
to
take
these
individual
appraisals,
put
them
all
together
and
maybe
you
can
apply
the
6%
discount
but
if
you
do
anything
beside
that
you
have
departed
from
the
constitutional
standard.
now,
the
commission
responded
to
that
argument
and
that's
what
all
is
this
discussion
is
about
how
and
what
they
could
do
in
the
abandonment
proceeding
the
commission
responded
to
that
argument
by
saying
there’s
nothing
in
this
broad
constitutional
purpose
in
our
argument
because
in
some
circumstances
we
could
require
you
to
sell
them
to
both
purchaser
who
was
going
to
continue
the
railroad
operation.
well,
i
think
the
worst
and
judge
friendly
expressed
some
doubts
about
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
somewhat
less
than
collusive
--
it's
collusive
enough
i
think
when
you
read
the
whole
thing
with
a
view
of
determining
whether
there’s
any
internal
consistency
but
my
position
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
attributed
to
it
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
attributes
to
it
the
same
meaning
i'm
attributing
to
it.
it
was
an
economic
--
it
was
essentially
an
economic
judgment
and
didn't
depend
on
legal
reason.
i
think
the
commission
may
have
given
dubious
or
more
involved
answer
to
this
argument
and
it
needed
to
be
given
i
should
thought
it
could
have
answered
simply
by
saying
that
you,
you
maybe
entitled
the
liquidation
value
but
we're
entitled
to
determine
liquidation
value
by
any
reasonable
method
that
it
has
support
any
evidence
and
this
method
does
but
instead
of
that
the
commission
value
to
this
discussion
about
what
it
could
or
could
not
do
in
an
abandonment
proceeding.
now,
there's
no
--
i
submit
you
look
at
that
report
and
consider
that
the
commission
was
dealing
with
an
economic
business
problem
on
how
to
value
property
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
its’
judgment
on
any
economic
issue
would
be
a
total
effective
if
it
we’re
told
that
there
may
be
some
doubt
or
even
when
it
was
wrong
about
the
legal
answer
it
gave
to
the
bondholders
argument.
i
think
that
economic
determination
can
stand
on
its
own
foot.
this
is
really
stronger
case
than
the
massachusetts
investors
company
case
was
because
there
they
chose
the
wrong
authority
or
two
statutes.
here
i
think
they
simply
possibly
gave
the
wrong
answer
to
an
argument
that
could
have
been
disposed
of
on
temporary.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
end
of
the
valuation
date,
the
end
of
january
--
of
december
1966.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
let
me
tell
you
how
that
was
done,
mr.
justice
white.
new
haven
first
broke
to
land
up
in
these
3,000
parcels.
they
then
had
3,000
as
i
understand
at
separate
appraisals
made
and
those
appraisals
did
not
take
into
account
the
problem
of
market
absorption
or
how
long
it
would
take
the
ceremony
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
or
sold
one
it
separately
at
or
about
that
time.
i
thought
they
sought
some
reasonable
exposure
to
market
but
after
the
appraisals
were
made,
then
a
witness
of
new
haven
came
along
and
examined
would
not
make
the
appraisals
but
he
examined
and
he
said,
well,
you
obviously
can't
sell
all
these
properties
at
once.
i
think
it
would
take
at
least
six
years.
i
think
even
that
witness
admitted
that
was
an
optimistic
estimate
and
of
course
my
clients
said.
and
one
of
the
new
haven's
witnesses
said
that
if
you
couldn't
it
in
six
years.
ten
years
about
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
but
you
didn't
have
it
because
these
appraisals
did
not
take
that
into
account.
this
is
all
and
i
think
you
can
read
our
brief
on
and
i
don't
believe
it
can
really
be
disputed
and
be
contested.
what
the
head
done,
the
only
thing
they've
done
was
as
to
certain
specific
pieces
of
property
they
had
applied
what
was
called
the
cats
and
dogs
discount.
they
may
indulge
us
as
to
certain
particular
parcels.
now,
the
witness
simon
took
that
into
account
and
he
said
even
with
that
he
would
use
this
method
of
valuing
the
property
which
produced
the
10-1/2%
discount
the
commission
used
but
the
cats
and
dogs
discount
was
confined
to
certain
particular
pieces
of
property
which
had
known
infirmities
at
the
time
the
appraisals
were
made.
it
really
didn't
look
to
the
future
risks
at
all.
there
are
--
the
risks
of
perhaps
covering
--
appearing
to
be
rather
disjointed
in
this
presentation
i
should
now
like
to
touch
briefly
on
some
of
the
points
that
come
up
in
respect
to
other
aspects
of
the
case
one
of
them
being
the
situation
these
two
yards
in
the
bronx.
i
hope
that
the
court
is
clear
that
the
question
in
there
is
the
--
really
come
to
down
to
appraisal
of
the
evidence
over
whether
some
railroad
in
the
event
of
the
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
which
served
these
two
new
haven
yards
and
the
bronx.
it's
those
two
yards
that
are
in
issue.
now,
the
commission
took
an
appraisal
which
was
made
on
the
assumption
that
the
new
haven
would
abandon
service.
the
bondholders
say
that
the
commission
was
bound
to
take
a
higher
appraisal
which
the
appraisers
said
would
only
apply
if
you
assume
that
some
railroad
other
than
the
new
haven
applied
or
supplied
the
same
service
to
new
haven
supplied
so
that
on
a
hearing
that
it
became
an
argument
over
whether
the
penn
central
would
voluntarily
or
could
be
compelled
to
serve
these
two
yards.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
know
the
map.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that’s
a
map
if
it
shows
the
lines
running
--
it
shows
two
lines
over
on
the
left
run
down,
a
little
down
in
harlem
river
and
yellow
line
going
across.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
what's
that?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
these
two
lines
over
in
the
left
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
are
now
are
all
new
york
central
lines.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
and
the
yellow
line
was
at
new
york
central
branch
which
ran
down
to
the
former
port
morris
yard
in
new
york
central
and
then
to
an
interchange
point
with
the
new
haven
and
any
traffic
that
the
new
york
central
moved
to
this
area
was
--
of
to
these
yards
or
to
the
hunts
point
market
was
interchanged
at
this
point.
now,
the
commission
heard
this
evidence
and
having
heard
it
found
that
on
all
facts
that
if
the
new
haven
were
liquidated
which
is
the
hypothesis
that
we're
considering,
the
penn
central
would
not
serve
these
yards
and
could
not
be
compelled
and
the
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
length
we
think
that
finding
was
fully
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence.
i
just
want
to
say
one
word
about
however
to
make
one
point
clear.
the
reorganization
court
took
the
view
that
the
penn
central
could
be
compelled
as
new
haven
were
liquidated
to
serve
that
market
operated
by
the
city
of
new
york.
the
commission
found
to
the
contrary
because
that
traffic
is
highly
unprofitable
but
even
if
that
it
is
assumed
and
this
is
the
point
i'd
like
to
make,
even
if
it's
assumed
that
the
penn
central
might
serve
that
hunts
point
vegetable
market
or
might
be
compelled
to
it
doesn’t
follow
that
it
would
serve
either
of
these
other
two
yards.
that's
--
their
only
the
evidence
showed
that
on
average
it
were
only
about
13
cars
a
day
went
to
those
yards
to
serve
them.
penn
central
would
either
have
to
buy
from
the
new
haven
in
liquidation
or
somebody
else
tracks
facilities
which
would
be
extremely
expansive
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
traffic
would
not
be
profitable
anyway
and
furthermore
the
evidence
shows
that
it
would
incur
very
substantial
operating
cost
for
the
purpose
of
this
small
volume
of
profit.
now,
as
far
as
the
suggestion
if
they
could
be
compelled
to
serve
them,
the
commission
disposed
to
that
by
examining
the
facts
and
saying
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
need
for
service
to
these
two
yards
or
of
that
the
hunts
point
market
for
that
matter
that
would
justify
requiring
service
in
the
public
interest
and
of
course
the
commission
would
have
to
make
a
contrary
finding
in
order
to
require
our
service.
so,
i
think
that
looking
at
that
whole
situation
it
is
quite
clear
that
your
mission
is
determination
there
which
required
which
is
dependent
upon
evidence
as
to
what
the
operating
conditions
were,
and
also
relied
to
all
of
the
commission’s
own
judgment
about
what
the
transportation
needs
were
should
clearly
be
sustained.
i
may
add
that
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
those
evidence
before
the
commission
of
the
new
haven
itself
sold
a
large
chunk,
one
of
these
yards
at
exactly
the
square
foot
price
that
was
in
the
appraisal
the
commission
adopted
which
was
50
cents
of
square
foot
lower
than
the
price
on
the
appraisal
that
the
bondholders
now
say
the
commission
was
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
adopt
so
that
i
think
it
is,
if
they
were,
we
have
a
remand
on
this
question
that
the
commission
might
have
to
have
another
look
at
the
whole
question
of
evaluation.
i
find
my
time
is
nearing
the
end.
i
should
like
to
say
something
about
this
issue
of
stock
because
i
think
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicate
that
there's
something
that
perhaps
that
should
be
said
about
it.
the
commission
in
treating
the
stock
issue
picks
an
inherent
value
where
this
stock
that
is
going
to
be
delivered
on
the
closing
date.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
was
a
determination
that
the
stock
would
have
that
value
in
itself
even
though
it
might
not
command
a
price
on
the
stock
market
as
of
the
particular
date
it
was
equal
to
value.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
he
has
to
keep
it
until
he
can
get
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
but
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
plan.
now
the
reason
i
think
if
you
think
about
the
situation
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
look,
mr.
justice
white,
they
were
not
going
to
use
this
money.
that
wasn't
it
and
we’re
going
to
put
this
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
new
haven.
they
were
going
to
put
the
stock
in
an
investment
company
and
keep
it
for
seven
years
and
the
reason
they
were
going
to
do
that
it
was
because
everyone
knew
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
merger.
at
the
beginning
of
this
merger
the
market
price
of
the
stock
wasn't
going
to
reflect
what
is
was
really
worth
over
any
period
of
time.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
not
arguing
a
stock
owned
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
commission,
i'm
saying
two
things.
i
think
the
commission
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind
involving
a
reorganization
of
railroad
is
entitled
so
long
as
it
has
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
to
determine
a
value
of
stock
that
is
in
inherent
rather
than
a
value
that
is
evidenced
by
a
current
market
quotation.
and
that
is
so
even
if
it
maybe
some
time
depending
upon
such
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
say
you
can
give
it
to
them
if
they
in
stock
that
has
an
inherent
value
on
that
date.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
can
--
i
think
it's
an
essential
part
of
the
power
the
commission
has
to
have
in
hearing
with
the
reorganization
of
this
kind
because
frequently
they
don’t
know
what
the
stock
would
be
worth.
in
terms
by
--
judge
by
stock
market
quotations,
they
know
what
they
can
determine
what's
inherent
valuing.
now,
of
course,
in
the
courts
below
it
took
care
of
those
problems
as
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
white.
money
is
different.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
reorganization,
and
i
think
you
could
find
this
concept
--
in
reorganization
when
you
give
stock
you’re
giving
what
amounts
to
an
equity
in
a
growing
concern.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
mind
you
they're
not
rejecting
stock.
they
want
stock.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
can't
answer
that
question.
all
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
all
i
can
say
is
that
they
have
indicated
they
want
stock
and
some
of
the
bondholders
have
said
that
they
want
more
stock
than
as
opposed
to
bonds.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
because
they
--
as
the
junior
bondholders,
they
are
only
hoping
this
thing
as
really
to
have
that
stock
go
up
in
value
so
that
they
can
have
something
out
of
it
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
that's
what
they
really
want,
yes
and
they
never
have
taken
that
position.
this
payment
of
this
large
amount
of
the
consideration
in
stock
is
something
that's
been
in
this
plan
from
the
very
beginning
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
bondholders
have
never
insisted
it
more
than
it
should
paid
in
that
bond.
now,
they
have
to
ask
occasional
times
to
make
up
differences
between
a
market
value
but
the
notion
of
getting
a
large
equity
position
in
this
new
company
has
been
in
this
thing
from
the
very
beginning
and
as
far
as
i
know
it’s
not
been
objected
to
by
anybody.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no
one
could
--
the
penn
central
wouldn't
have
that
money
and
they
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
you
can’t
blame
that
on
anyone
except
to
possibly
penn
central
but
the
notion,
the
distinction
between
a
market
quotation
and
inherent
value
is
not
a
noble
distinction
in
the
law.
you
looked
at
the
valuation
cases
under
the
appraisal
cases
they're
infrequent
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
they
get
something
that
is
in
a
--
i
submit
it's
the
worst
stuff.
now,
they're
going
to
have
to
wait
a
little
while
to
get
it.
they
may
have
to
wait
seven
years.
in
the
meantime,
they
got
an
underwriting.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
judge
anderson.
it
was
taken
by
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
and
accepted
by
the
commission.
so
that
is
now
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
of
course,
any
modifications
in
that
underwriting
which
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
because
it
involves
this
problem
under
section
28.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
think
they
are
allocating
any
burden
on
the
bondholders.
i
think
they've
given
the
bondholders
my
judgment
more
than
the
bondholders
would
get
if
they
really
broke
up
this
railroad
and
sold
it.
i
think
the
real
problem
is
that
the
penn
central
has
been
required
to
absorb
these
deficits
and
pay
a
price
that
my
client
believes
is
too
high
for
real
liquidation
value
and
the
end
is
not
going
to
come
--
the
effect
is
not
going
to
stop
the
equity
at
penn
central
come.
this
is
going
to
affect
the
rate
based
that
caused
the
ratemaking
power
of
the
commission
and
the
viability
and
the
vitality
of
penn
central
is
that
the
transportation
company
and
this
transportation
service
that’s
available
to
shippers
all
over
the
organized
states.
that's
why
the
commission
has
authority
over
securities
so
that
the
capital
structure
can't
be
inflated.
now,
at
the
end
of
our
brief
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
you
can't
do
that
of
course
under
the
law
of
the
constitution
and
you
have
to
give
them
at
least
we’re
operating
on
the
assumption
they
have
to
get
the
liquidation
value.
when
we
think
they
got
it
in
a
little
bit
more.
they
got
$8
million
for
a
building
that’s
never
going
to
be
built
over
at
grand
central
terminal,
that
we
think
was
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it's
very
doubtful.
i
say
never
is
too
strong
a
word,
i
was
carried
away
by
the
acts
of
enthusiasm
--[laughter]
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
there
is
great
doubt
that
it's
going
to
be
built.
they
got
$6
million
because
the
commission
overlooked.
they
forgot
or
disregarded
the
evidence
about
how
the
cost
of
the
terminal
in
the
point
to
the
brief.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right,
the
figures
of
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
whatever
it
is.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
comes
in
the
first
instance
from
the
penn
central
and
ultimately
it's
going
to
come
from
the
pockets
of
the
people
who
pay
rates.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
just
would
want
to
say
one
thing.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
the
litigation.
i
just
wish
to
say
the
court
on
this
question,
free
use
of
the
grand
central
terminal
that
as
we
read
the
briefs
in
states
they
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
haven't
paid
penn
central
anything
for
the
use
of
their
making
that
terminal.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that
step
provides
for
the
investment
company
in
seven
years
and
how
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
not
before
you
now.
