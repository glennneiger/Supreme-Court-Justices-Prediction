you
may
defer
a
moment
if
you
wish
mr.

until
we
see
that
all
counsels
are
at

you
may
proceed
now
mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
mr.
seymour,
i
suppose
the
court
on
that
theory
pursued
your
point
might
have
said
since
it
can
never
be
abandoned
will
just
spread
this
abandonment
delay
indefinitely.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
quite
got
your
point,
as
long
as
got
you
interrupted
on
the
--
on
charging
new
haven
with
the
losses
for
the
year.
and
then,
i
think
as
you
put
it
superimposing,
the
one
year
abandonment
delay
on
top
that
hypothetical
loss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
was
a
real
loss,
not
a
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
seymour.
mr.
migdal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on.
could
that
have
been
operated
by
penn
central
without
access
to
the
terminal?
could
this
operation
be
carried
on
without
access
to
the
terminal,
which
was
the
exclusive
right
of
new

are
you

the

chief

e.

generally
speaking,
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
long
past
history
it
was
really
--
wouldn't
it
really
be
thought
more
as
being
very
conservative?
can
you
think
of
any
matter
of
that
magnitude
that
has
been
completed
within
one
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
even
two
or
three?
i
could
take
you
quite
a
number
of
years
in
the
consequent
incrimination
of
the
device
if
someone
really
set
up
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
as
it
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
agree
with
your
friends
--
do
you
agree
with
the
defense
made
by
your
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
that
the
commission
could
never
permit
the
new
haven
to
stop
running?
therefore,
any
hypothetical
period
of
time
for
litigating
the
issue
was
really
a
good
exercise.
but
the
time
lapse
would
merely
be
a
period
within
which
some
other
solution
in
transportation
problem
would
be
worked
out,
is
that
not
realistically
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
may
be
helpful
to
you
mr.
goodman
and
perhaps
to
mr.
cox,
when
he
give
us
his
analysis
to
indicate
to
you
what
gives
me
some
problems
and
maybe
you
could
clear
them
up
that
the
commission
seems
to
have
work
for
the
serious
of
hypothetical
situations
and
projections
and
then
if
to
mingles
with
the
hypothetical
reality
is
just
the
high
protocol
with
the
which
is
unknown
with
the
reality
which
it
comes
to
be
known
from
time
to
time.
and
unless
i
missed
something
almost
invariably,
the
adjustment
of
the
hypothetical
by
the
real
resulted
in
reduction
the
purchase
price.
now,
may
have
missed
some
factors,
is
that
analysis
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
--
wouldn't
you
know
--
well,
i'll
--
my
question
then
--
it's
lunch
now.
today
counsel,
we're
altering
the
schedule
a
little
bit.
we're
going
to
allow
counsel
one
hour
for
lunch.
since
you
will
be
occupied
for
an
hour
we
will
not
return
for
an
hour.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
to
that
extent,
it
has
a
tendency
to
enlarge
ratemaking
base,
doesn't
it?
it
can
have
that
as
you
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
can,
i
didn't
say
it
would
in
the
full
amount
of
the
differential
but
it
can
have
an
impact
on
the
ratemaking
base?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
goodman.
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
misfortunes
that
you
spoke
out
that
were
encountered
by
the
new
haven
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
were
well
known,
penn
central
have
encountered
to
some
degree
some
of
these
same
misfortunes,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
this
combination
of
penn
and
central
first
and
now
the
inclusion
of
new
haven
which
was
made
as
one
of
the
conditions
is
something
compelled
by
the
public
interest
in
furtherance
of
the
national
transportation
system
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
we
have
here
something
of
unwilling
buyers
and
perhaps
unwilling
sellers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
more
question
is,
you
have
a
little
time
left.
i
get
the
feeling
that,
perhaps
this
isn't
a
question.
i
got
a
feeling
throughout
here
that
the
commission
faced
with
trying
to
implement
the
national
transportation
policy
with
two
somewhat
distressed
railroads
already
merged
and
another
more
distressed
railroad
tucked
on
to
the
program
really
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
allocate
the
deficits
if
you
could
call
them
that.
here's
the
transportation
system
that
really
calls
for
large
subsidies
from
the
state
of
federal
government
and
they
aren't
available
and
so
they
are
allocating
this
burden
on
the
bondholders.
is
that
a
--
can
you
point
in
a
minute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
policy
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
cox.
you
have
sixteen
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
yours
can
be
manufactured
on
account
of
the
--
they
would
have
to
put
the
burden
on
the
penn
central?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
real
estate
evaluation
again,
to
pursue
justice
white's
point.
if
the
generality
of
opinion
about
the
real
estate
value
is
correct,
it
does
not
involve
much
risk
for
a
buyer
to
buy
real
estates
in
1970
at
1970
prices
for
payment
on
1978?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
essence
of
your
point
on
that
evaluation
of
these
properties,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
commission
forced
on
the
seller
all
or
a
very
large
part
of
the
risks
if
not
all
of
the
risks
on
that
score.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
counsel.
we
will
not
to
commence
the
second
case
for
today
that
was
involved
splitting
the
argument
and
counsel
could
not
possibly
finished
today
so
we
will
arise
at
this
time.
