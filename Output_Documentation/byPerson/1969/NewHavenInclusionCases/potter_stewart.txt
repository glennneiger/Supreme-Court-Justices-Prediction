justice
potter
stewart
was
judge
van
voorhis
appointed
the
special
master
for
the
purpose
only
of
considering
this
aspect
of
the
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
jurisdiction
was
confined
only
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
retired
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
judge
anderson
think
can
precede
the
three-judge
court
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
by
what
time
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
would
be
good
rail
service
available
to
that
market
area?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
just
--
having
said
that
before
you
proceed
so
that
i
can
understand,
be
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
there
is
no
issue
remaining
as
to
the
excess
income?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
goes
to
the
$506
million
--
justice
potter
stewart
$5.6
million,
the
capitalization
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
value
of
--
to
the
value
of
that
income?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
your
answer,
at
least
your
first
answer
is
that
the
penn
central
did
acquire
your
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
then
what
you
--
you're
talking
about
the
right
to
enter
the
grand
central
station
with
your
train?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understood
that
the
rational
was
that
even
if
the
states
of
connecticut
and/or
new
york
or
in
combination
acquired
it
their
bargaining
power
would
be
such
that
they
would
not
pay
anything
for?
justice
potter
stewart
was
i
mistaken
in
the
rational?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
mistake.
however
not
--
i
mean
it's
the
result
however
not
unique
to
judge
friendly
the
reorganization
court,
judge
van
voorhis
all
agreed,
all
the
judges
concerned
agreed
in
describing
and
attributing
no
value
to
this
income.
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
without
attacking
judge
friendly’s
reasoning
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
the
result
was
reached
by
all
four
of
the
judge’s
concerned
the
same
result.
justice
potter
stewart
as
we're
talking
about
liquidating
value.
there'd
be
no
need
to
--
if
the
property
was
going
to
be
liquidated,
there
wouldn't
be
any
new
haven
trains
entering
the
station.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
little
bit
--
i
find
it
little
bit
of
the
same
inconsistency
in
this,
in
your
argument
that
i
find
in
the
argument
made
in
the
brief
and
i
think
so
far
not
argued
orally
that
value
should
be
attributed
for
going
concern
value
in
this
case
when
at
the
same
time
you
are
arguing
for
liquidating
value.
justice
potter
stewart
somewhere,
the
figure
$70
million
that
is
a
capitalized
value
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
point
of
judge
anderson?
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
that
comes
to
$70
million?
justice
potter
stewart
capitalized
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
capitalized
value
of
that
income?
justice
potter
stewart
$27
million.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
december
of
1968?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
the
investing
public.
are
there
a
lot
of
treasury
shares
or
authorized
but
unissued
shares
in
the
penn
central?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
are
these
shares
going
to
come
from?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
have
to
use
cash
to
buy
them
unless
they
are
authorized
but
unissued
or
treasury
share.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
and
a
price
could
not
stay
up
for
five
days,
if
you're
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
a
self-correcting
if
you're
correct
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
so
the
condition
wouldn't
be
met?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
liquidation
value
to
what
as
of
december
31,
1966
but
discounted
over
for
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
would
take
at
least
six
years
to
dispose
off
the
assets,
is
that
it?
plus
discounted
in
your
submission
by
another
year
because
of
that
year
delaying
be
for
the
commission
would
permit
development.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
the
date
of
liquidation
value?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
six
years
estimated
to
dispose
of
it
and
then
you
had
another
year
for
abandonment,
permission
abandonment,
is
that
about
it?
or
by
others
all
along?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
would
it
take
anything
like
a
year
because
the
new
haven
have
been
studied
and
restudied
in
the
campus
and
that
they
knew
the
situation,
there
is
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
liquidate
your
opponent
say
under
the
decision
of
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
it
was
very
clear
with
that
because
of
the
deficit
written
situation
of
the
new
haven
there
was
no
question
about
it
that
right
being
exercisable
in
this
case,
that’s
what
i've
understand
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
argument
to
(inaudible)
perhaps
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goodman,
on
losses
prior
to
when
the
penn
central
took
actually
physically
took
the
new
haven
over
and
began
to
absorb
all
this
losses
you’re
talking
about.
how
were
--
how
was
the
bondholder’s
first
claim
on
their
--
to
their
liquidation
value
lowered
or
eroded
away
by
operating
losses?
i
doubt
to
be
argued
that
it
is
said
that
some
$60
million
of
value
was
eroded
the
way
as
far
as
the
bondholder's
concerned
by
losses
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
of
the
transfer.
justice
potter
stewart
in
part
but
i
gather
there
weren't
$60
million
from
the
trustees’
certificate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
else
then.
just
by
wearing
out
or
something
like
that
or
depreciation?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
the
extent
some
of
these
expenses
were
taken
up
with
some
kind
of
arrangement
which
involved
the
prior
lien
that
would
be
true,
wouldn’t
it?
some
lien
prior
trustees’
certificate,
i
suppose
were
they
prior
or
subject
to
the
lien
of
abandonment?
justice
potter
stewart
those
surely
were
subsequent
to
the
bondholders
in
lien?
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
suppose
post
payment
–
postponement
of
the
real
estate
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
downside
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
accept
this
it
goes
to
share.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
market
value
as
that
date
happened
to
be
then
in
the
market?
justice
potter
stewart
holding
950,000
shares
at
penn
central.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
protection,
yes
but
up
to
$87.50
a
share?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
mr.
cox
that's
the
only
standard
that
the
commission
could
apply,
do
you
mean
that's
the
only
constitutional
standard
or
statutory
standard
or
practical
standard
or
what
do
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it's
required
as
a
minimal
standard
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
do
you
mean
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
point
of
what
it's
all
about
is
a
year
from
when?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
is,
as
i
understand
part
of
the
claim
of
your
brothers
in
opposition
is
that
had
they
not
been
had
done
a
primrose
path,
that's
perhaps
their
own
metaphor
but
had
they
not
been
induce
into
this
inclusion
business.
they
would
have
filed
from
abandonment
years
ago
back
in
the
middle
60's.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
didn't
but
we're
talking
about
alice
in
wonderland,
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
$5
million
and
$500,000
that
was
prorated
in
1968?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
just
a
present
value
of
future
money?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
we've
been
introduced
two
other
things
i.e.
the
risk
of
real
estate
value
is
going
down
particularly
which
for
the
betterment
and
number
2,
the
power
of
the
commission
to
require
a
sale
in
bulk
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
will
help
so.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
language
that
he
calls
somewhat
less
than
collusive
actually.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
understood
that
he
attributed
toward
a
different
meaning,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
i.e.
the
risk
involved.(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
one's
a
harlem
division?
the
other
is
a
hudson
division?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you're
saying
that
although
you
agreed
at
the
outset
that
either
under
the
constitution
of
the
statute,
they
are
entitled
the
liquidation
value
that
you
can
satisfy
that
standard
by
giving
it
to
them
any
time
within
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
you're
saying
yes.
it
answers
yes
if
you
can
satisfy
that
standard
anytime
within
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
whose
idea
was
the
underwriting?
judge
anderson?
justice
potter
stewart
it
originated
with
him,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
are
rights
over
the
terminal
such
as,
that’s
never
going
to
be
built?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
there
have
been
references
throughout
the
brief
to
an
extent
of
oral
argument
that
this
involves
step
one
of
the
plan
and
i
think
i
understand
this
involves
how
much
is
the
new
haven
and
that
it
got
to
be
paid
for
its
assets.
do
i
understand
then
that
step
two
is
how
those
assets
are
going
to
be
distributed
among
the
various
owners?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
asked
before
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reorganization
court
invented
the
underwriting
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
accepted
by
the
commission
in
principle
and
it
was
accepted
by
the
three-judge
statutory
court
with
a
couple
of
minor
fair
variations.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
he
said
that
there
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
commission
but
he
was
in
dissent
for
either
more
shares
or
some
other
provision
that
provide
the
full
$83
million?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
the
rolling
stocks
of
your
railroad?
where
those
probably
under
philadelphia
equipment
trust
or
the
equivalent,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
additional
sales?
justice
potter
stewart
your
assets
are
primarily
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
because
those
would
be
prior
claims,
wouldn't
they?
they
are
all
that
cars
and
locomotives
that
were
subject
to
that
sort
of
a
conditional
sales
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
or
else
the
rolling
stock
is
repossessed?
justice
potter
stewart
was
judge
van
voorhis
appointed
the
special
master
for
the
purpose
only
of
considering
this
aspect
of
the
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
jurisdiction
was
confined
only
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
retired
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
judge
anderson
think
can
precede
the
three-judge
court
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
by
what
time
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
would
be
good
rail
service
available
to
that
market
area?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
just
--
having
said
that
before
you
proceed
so
that
i
can
understand,
be
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
there
is
no
issue
remaining
as
to
the
excess
income?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
goes
to
the
$506
million
--
justice
potter
stewart
$5.6
million,
the
capitalization
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
value
of
--
to
the
value
of
that
income?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
your
answer,
at
least
your
first
answer
is
that
the
penn
central
did
acquire
your
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
then
what
you
--
you're
talking
about
the
right
to
enter
the
grand
central
station
with
your
train?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understood
that
the
rational
was
that
even
if
the
states
of
connecticut
and/or
new
york
or
in

acquired
it
their
bargaining
power
would
be
such
that
they
would
not
pay
anything
for?
justice
potter
stewart
was
i
mistaken
in
the
rational?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
mistake.
however
not
--
i
mean
it's
the

however

justice
potter
stewart
without

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
the
result
was
reached
by
all
four
of
the
judge’s
concerned
the
same
result.
justice
potter
stewart
as
we're
talking
about
liquidating
value.
there'd
be
no
need
to
--
if
the
property
was
going
to
be
liquidated,
there
wouldn't
be
any
new
haven
trains
entering
the
station.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a

--
i
find
it

the

--
justice

and
that
was
the
point
of

i
beg
your
pardon?
justice

stewart
that
comes
to
$70

justice
potter

capitalized
--
justice
potter

and
what
is
the

of
that

justice
potter

$27

justice

that
was
in

justice
potter
stewart
they're

are

justice

where

you're
going
to
have
to
use

to
buy
them
unless

justice

well
then
and
a

could

so
that's

it's
argument
to
(inaudible)
perhaps
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goodman,
on
losses
prior
to
when
the
penn
central
took
actually
physically
took
the
new
haven
over
and
began
to
absorb
all
this
losses
you’re
talking
about.
how
were
--
how
was
the
bondholder’s
first
claim
on
their
--
to
their
liquidation
value
lowered
or
eroded
away
by
operating
losses?
i
doubt
to
be
argued
that
it
is
said
that
some
$60
million
of
value
was
eroded
the
way
as
far
as
the
bondholder's
concerned
by
losses
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
of
the
transfer.
justice
potter
stewart
in
part
but
i
gather
there
weren't
$60
million
from
the
trustees’
certificate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
else
then.
just
by
wearing
out
or
something
like
that
or
depreciation?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
the
extent
some
of
these
expenses
were
taken
up
with
some
kind
of
arrangement
which
involved
the
prior
lien
that
would
be
true,
wouldn’t
it?
some
lien
prior
trustees’
certificate,
i
suppose
were
they
prior
or
subject
to
the
lien
of
abandonment?
justice
potter
stewart
those
surely
were
subsequent
to
the
bondholders
in
lien?
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
suppose
post
payment
–
postponement
of
the
real
estate
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
downside
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
accept
this
it
goes
to
share.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
market
value
as
that
date
happened
to
be
then
in
the
market?
justice
potter
stewart
holding
950,000
shares
at
penn
central.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
protection,
yes
but
up
to
$87.50
a
share?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
mr.
cox
that's
the
only
standard
that
the
commission
could
apply,
do
you
mean
that's
the
only
constitutional
standard
or
statutory
standard
or
practical
standard
or
what
do
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it's
required
as
a
minimal
standard
by
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
do
you
mean
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
point
of
what
it's
all
about
is
a
year
from
when?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
is,
as
i
understand
part
of
the
claim
of
your
brothers
in
opposition
is
that
had
they
not
been
had
done
a
primrose
path,
that's
perhaps
their
own
metaphor
but
had
they
not
been
induce
into
this
inclusion
business.
they
would
have
filed
from
abandonment
years
ago
back
in
the
middle
60's.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
didn't
but
we're
talking
about
alice
in
wonderland,
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
$5
million
and
$500,000
that
was
prorated
in
1968?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
just
a
present
value
of
future
money?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
we've
been
introduced
two
other
things
i.e.
the
risk
of
real
estate
value
is
going
down
particularly
which
for
the
betterment
and
number
2,
the
power
of
the
commission
to
require
a
sale
in
bulk
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
will
help
so.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
language
that
he
calls
somewhat
less
than
collusive
actually.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
understood
that
he
attributed
toward
a
different
meaning,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
i.e.
the
risk
involved.(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
one's
a
harlem
division?
the
other
is
a
hudson
division?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you're
saying
that
although
you
agreed
at
the
outset
that
either
under
the
constitution
of
the
statute,
they
are
entitled
the
liquidation
value
that
you
can
satisfy
that
standard
by
giving
it
to
them
any
time
within
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
you're
saying
yes.
it
answers
yes
if
you
can
satisfy
that
standard
anytime
within
ten
years?
justice
potter
stewart
whose
idea
was
the
underwriting?
judge
anderson?
justice
potter
stewart
it
originated
with
him,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
are
rights
over
the
terminal
such
as,
that’s
never
going
to
be
built?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
there
have
been
references
throughout
the
brief
to
an
extent
of
oral
argument
that
this
involves
step
one
of
the
plan
and
i
think
i
understand
this
involves
how
much
is
the
new
haven
and
that
it
got
to
be
paid
for
its
assets.
do
i
understand
then
that
step
two
is
how
those
assets
are
going
to
be
distributed
among
the
various
owners?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
asked
before
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reorganization
court
invented
the
underwriting
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
accepted
by
the
commission
in
principle
and
it
was
accepted
by
the
three-judge
statutory
court
with
a
couple
of
minor
fair
variations.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
he
said
that
there
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
commission
but
he
was
in
dissent
for
either
more
shares
or
some
other
provision
that
provide
the
full
$83
million?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
the
rolling
stocks
of
your
railroad?
where
those
probably
under
philadelphia
equipment
trust
or
the
equivalent,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
additional
sales?
justice
potter
stewart
your
assets
are
primarily
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
because
those
would
be
prior
claims,
wouldn't
they?
they
are
all
that
cars
and
locomotives
that
were
subject
to
that
sort
of
a
conditional
sales
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
or
else
the
rolling
stock
is
repossessed?
