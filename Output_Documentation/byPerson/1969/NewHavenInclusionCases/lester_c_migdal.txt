mr.
lester
c.
migdal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
commission
has
acknowledged
that
liquidation
value
was
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
with
respect
to
the
property
of
the
new
haven.
it
has
failed
in
several
instances
to
give
that
liquidation
value
because
it
has
not
understood.
but
when
you
go
to
find
liquidation
value,
what
you
must
find
is
what
the
liquidator
of
that
property
would
receive
if
he
sold
it
in
the
method
that
was
best
suited
to
his
disposition.
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
the
bulk
sale
discount
and
it
is
what
is
wrong
with
the
harlem
river
evaluation.
and
that
was
the
question
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
address
themselves
to.
what
you
have
in
those
two
yards
were
simply
the
question
of
whether
there
would
or
would
be
not
rail
service
available
to
the
industrial
uses
of
those
two
yards
in
the
event
of
liquidation.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards?
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
the
point.
now
there
isn't
any
question
of
the
two
values,
of
the
only
two
values
we
need
to
look
at
here.
that
is
to
say
it
is
either
the
18
million
or
the
22
and
a
half
million
because
the
testimony
is
the
testimony
of
a
same
man
mr.
mckean
and
one
represents
a
discount
he
took
on
certain
liquidation
assumptions
which
were
furnished
to
him
and
those
liquidation
assumptions
were
that
all
of
the
electric
power
would
be
turned
off.
there
would
be
no
power
to
the
property.
although
this
was
property
just
adjacent
to
the
consolidated
edison
power
plant
and
all
the
tracks
would
be
torn
up.
now
i
submit
that
that
was
not
new
haven's
best
method
of
liquidation.
one
other
thing
is
the
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
the
problem
that
you
face
here
is
what
you
mean
when
you
say
scrap
value,
what
you
mean
when
you
say
net
salvage
value.
now,
i
say
that
what
you
mean
when
you
say
net
salvage
value
is
the
best
use
you
can
make
of
it.
and
in
this
case,
to
have
torn
up
the
tracks,
to
have
taken
out
the
electric
power
would
first
have
depreciated
its
value
of
the
new
haven’s
asset
and
then
to
have
sold
the
portion
of
it
as
junk
and
the
balance
of
it
for
whatever
you
could
get
for
it
and
no
sensible
liquidator
would
have
liquidated
in
that
way.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
judge
winfield
and
judge
anderson
both
said
that
it
was
simply
impermissible
to
permit
the
assumption,
the
basis
here
of
liquidation
to
assume
that
there
would
be
no
service
available.
they
were
aware
that
new
york
city
had
built
a
hunts
point
market
and
that
it
had
spent
a
hundred
million
dollars
on
that.
it
was
a
food
lifeline
in
new
york.
it
was
being
served
then
by
a
small
piece
of
track
which
ran
--
if
you
think
of
it
as
running
north,
it
is
3,000
feet
between
the
harlem
river
yards
up
to
a
point
where
it
meets
the
port
morris
branch
of
pennsylvania
central
which
was
not
liquidated.
and
thence,
the
two
yards,
the
oak
point
yard
and
the
port
morris
yard
being
cheek
by
jowl,
there
is
a
switch
point
there
that
comes
on
to
the
new
haven
and
it
continues
on
up.
in
another
mile,
there
is
a
spare
track
and
that
spare
track
goes
another
mile
with
hunts
point
yards
and
therefore,
they
have
never
seemed
that
judge
anderson
the
possibility.
either
for
the
liquidator
would
tear
up
to
the
track
and
in
that
way
make
it
impossible
to
realize
the
value
he
could
on
the
sale
of
his
136
acres
in
the
harlem
river
yards
and
in
the
oak
point
yards
and
at
the
same
time
make
it
impossible
for
new
york
city
to
have
the
rail
service
that
it
required.
because
most
of
this
--
for
99%
of
its
distance,
this
came
in
on
pennsylvania
cost
and
was
then
switched
at
the
port
morris
yard
and
then
went
to
hunts
point.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
your
honor
on
this
point
there
is
no
remand
to
the
commission
because
i
think
that
record
is
to
perfectly
clear
that
if
you
find
that
these
yards
and
that's
right.
there
is
one
question
however
that
does
raise
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
remand.
in
the
valuation
when
the
--
when
you
consider
the
possibility
that
the
mile
and
a
half
of
track
would
be
torn
up,
you
then
have
to
consider
that
on
the
liquidation
hypothesis
that
that
track
would
continue
even
if
the
new
haven
for
example
had
to
give
that
track
to
new
york
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
traffic
continue,
then
the
value
of
the
right
of
way,
which
is
about
$500,000
might
have
to
be
subtracted
from
the
22
and
a
half
million
dollars
because
then
you
would
have
valued
it
twice.
however,
judge
anderson
clearly
felt
that
there
was
no
danger
that
new
york
city
would
pay
a
fair
price
for
that
right
of
way
in
order
to
preserve
the
service
to
the
hunts
point
yards
and
therefore
he
did
not
make
that
deduction.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
so
perfectly
plain
incorrect.
that
it
does
not
need
to
be
remand
again
the
value
of
that
small
piece
of
right
of
way
which
at
worst
would
have
been
donated
to
new
york
city
or
to
the
development
of
the
hunts
point
and
of
the
oak
point
and
harlem
river
yards.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
it
is
3,000
feet
from
the
harlem
river
yards
to
the
oak
point
yards
switch
with
penn
central's
port
morris
branch,
then
it
runs
on
another
mile
until
it
meets
the
spare
track
to
the
hunts
point
market.
in
a
certain
sense,
this
unwillingness
to
permit
the
new
haven
its
real
liquidation
value
while
always
ascertaining
that
liquidation
value
is
what
is
being
granted,
the
commission’s
treatment
of
the
grand
central
terminal
is
another
case
in
point.
for
there,
the
new
haven
enjoys
the
right
or
enjoyed
the
right
until
the
closing
of
bringing
its
trains
into
the
station
and
that
had
this
partly
by
charters
that
which
went
back
to
the
1840’s
and
it
had
it
partly
by
virtue
of
agreements,
which
had
made
with
the
central.
now
that
right
permitted
the
new
haven
to
operate
its
trains
into
the
station
and
out
of
all
of
the
terminal
properties
and
here,
we
are
not
talking
simply
about
the
station
income
itself.
we
are
talking
about
all
of
the
park
avenue
properties
in
all
of
the
area
income.
by
agreement,
these
were
being
put
into
the
terminal
account
and
all
the
expenses
were
coming
out
of
the
terminal
account
to
pay
the
expenses
of
both
railroads,
central
and
the
new
haven
in
the
station.
now
obviously,
this
income
grew
as
the
real
estate
developed
and
it
has
become
more
profitable.
in
1907,
this
was
a
pretty
remote
part
of
new
york
city
but
that
change
in
time.
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
as
the
income
increased,
the
difference
between
the
actual
expenses
and
the
income
from
the
properties
began
to
disappear
and
therefore
the
parties
each
year
have
to
contribute
less
and
less
out
of
their
own
pockets
in
order
to
meet
the
expenses
of
their
operations
in
the
terminal
and
all
of
the
expenses
of
the
property.
and
there
came
a
time
in
1964
and
thereafter
when
in
fact
there
was
more
income
coming
in
than
the
total
of
the
expenses
both
for
the
fixed
charges
and
taxes
on
the
real
estate
and
the
operating
cost.
now
when
that
happened,
there
was
excess
income.
so
that
a
question
then
arose
as
to
what
the
division
of
the
excess
income
should
be
between
the
parties
so
that
you've
got
excess
income
and
terminal
income
as
the
way
in
which
i
have
divided
it
now
for
this
discussion
and
i
hope
that
all
of
that
is
clear.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct
your
honor,
though
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
the
$5.6
million.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
yet
it
is
extremely
important
understand
how
the
issue
with
respect
to
the
excess
income
settle.
in
the
first
instance,
central
had
denied
that
the
new
haven
had
any
right
in
the
income,
those
properties
produced
in
the
event,
but
the
new
haven
stopped
the
operation.
now
as
a
result
of
that
in
the
negotiations
between
the
trustee
and
penn
central,
no
value
was
allowed
for
that
and
we
argue
that
that
was
all
wrong,
it
was
all
wrong
because
this
matter
had
been
the
nature
of
the
new
haven's
interest
studies
had
been
litigated
in
the
new
york
courts.
it
had
gone
all
the
way
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
new
haven
was
in
effect
an
equal
partner
with
the
central
in
the
management
of
those
properties
and
treated
them
as
joint
venture.
the
commission
however
on
the
first
ground
gave
us
this
small
value
of
$13
million
because
it
considered
that
it
ought
to
--
it
considered
in
the
first
place
but
there
was
a
great
question
as
to
whether
it
would
survive
in
spite
of
the
rule
in
the
baltimore
case
as
to
whether
we
have
a
real
interest.
and
on
the
second
place
it
considered
that
it
ought
to
use
as
either
end
of
the
equation
41%
on
one
side
because
that
was
our
traditional
car
use
in
the
station.
and
$5
million
which
was
a
certain
nuisance
value
attributable
to
the
claim
and
it
split
the
difference
and
came
out
with
$13
million
and
it
was
important
that
at
this
point,
judge
van
voorhis
was
named
to
look
into
the
question
because
the
result
of
his
decision
was
to
declare
that
the
new
haven
railroad
was
in
fact
an
equal
partner
and
that
it
was
an
equal
partner
in
an
indefeasible
way.
and
therefore,
the
new
haven's
interest
in
that
excess
income,
the
profits
from
the
operations
had
to
be
fully
valued
and
we
have
to
be
fully
paid.
and
they
say
that
its
declaration
that
we
were
an
equal
partner
and
that
that
interest
was
in
fact
indefeasible.
it
is
very
important
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
what
ought
to
have
happened
to
the
$5.6
million.
what
we
had
is
penn
central's
witnesses
themselves
testified
to
was
the
greatest
bargaining
history.
we
had
a
right
to
come
in
to
that
terminal
with
our
trains
and
because
the
terminal
income
was
so
great,
we
did
not
have
to
pay
for
it.
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
why
now
when
that
valuable
interest
is
turned
over
to
penn
central
so
that
penn
central
can
perform
the
service
we
formally
performed
and
perform
it
without
cost
because
it’s
utilizing
the
same
income.
why
should
penn
central
not
be
required
to
pay
for
it?
now
i
must
say
that
if
you
read
judge
friendly's
opinion
on
this
point,
you
will
see
on
the
first
round
of
review,
you
will
see
that
essentially
there
was
only
one
ground
in
spite
of
all
the
grounds
that
i
finally
talked
about.
there
is
only
one
ground
that
really
determined
his
decision
and
that
was
his
view
whether
if
we
stop
running,
if
the
new
haven
stopped
operating,
whether
anybody
would
acquire
our
right,
whether
anybody
would
be
interested
in
doing
that
or
whether
it
was
so
speculative
that
somebody
would
acquire
that
right
that
we
ought
not
to
be
paid
for
it.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
was
inevitable
that
somebody
would
acquire
it
because
if
nobody
would
acquire
it,
then
precisely
what
the
chief
justice
adverted
to
with
respect
when
he
spoke
to
mr.
seymour
would
have
occurred.
this
would
have
gone
on
until
we
would
have
been
drained
of
all
equity.
on
the
one
hand,
we
will
not
permit
to
stop
the
operations
because
it
was
vital
to
the
public
interest.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
conceived
by
judge
friendly
that
there
might
not
be
somebody
who
would
pick
up
that
service
and
would
perform
it
for
its
own
people.
now
that
i
submit
was
simply
unreasonable.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
that
we
submit
would
have
worked
both
an
inequitable
result
and
an
unconstitutional
one.
to
say
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
in
part
are,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
if
that
was
one
of
the
statements
made
at
one
point
in
the
case
and
i
think
that
i
must
fairly
admit
it,
though
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
the
fundamental
one.
i
think
the
fundamental
point
was
that
it
was
too
speculative
that
the
states
would
acquire
it
and
therefore
to
speculative
to
value
that
right.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
judge
friendly’s
opinion,
you
will
note
that
he
says
that
it
was
possible
to
conceive
of
the
possibility
that
the
service
would
only
be
acquired
as
far
as
woodlawn.
and
in
woodlawn,
those
30,000
daily
passengers
would
be
discharged
each
morning
to
walk
four
blocks
to
the
nearest
bronx
subway
station
and
then
they
could
find
their
way
to
work
somehow
and
then
go
back
in
the
evening
the
same
way.
and
i
submit
that
that
simply
was
an
impractical
solution
that
judge
friendly
should
have
noticed
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
commission
should
have
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
no
possibility
that
that
service
would
cease.
new
york
and
connecticut
had
testified
repeatedly
in
the
train
discontinuance
case
for
example.
but
that
was
essential
to
their
citizens
and
that
they
were
prepared
to
pay
for
it
and
to
produce
it.
now
we
are
here
today
in
a
new
posture
of
this
case
because
an
authority
was
formed
in
fact
by
the
states
of
new
york
and
connecticut.
they
have
in
fact
entered
into
an
agreement
with
penn
central
to
operate
bank
service.
now
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
it
could
not
be
operated
into
the
terminal
unless
there
was
lease
from
penn
central
to
a
new
user.
now
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
felt
that
--
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
on
earlier
case
decided
in
this
court
by
judge
cardozo.
judge
cardozo
in
describing
the
new
haven's
interest
there
said
that
it
was
the
value
under
the
agreement
of
the
right
to
use
terminal.
but
while
we
did
not
have
the
fee,
we
did
have
this
valuable
right.
judge
friendly
himself
refers
to
it
as
a
unique
right,
but
he
questions
what
value
should
be
put
on
it
if
in
the
end,
we
are
trying
to
cease
operations
and
as
he
says,
no
one
will
acquire.
now
that
we
think
is
where
the
mistake
was.
new
york
and
connecticut
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
end-result,
you
were
correct,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
am
attacking
judge
friendly's
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
that
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
this,
judge
anderson
harbored
and
still
harbors
great
doubts
to
the
correctness
of
that
result.
judge
anderson
always
felt
that
some
value
should
be
placed
on
that
and
he
therefore
remanded
to
the
commission
the
first
time
and
asked
them
to
find
what
value
if
any
inhered
in
the
new
haven's
right
to
enter
the
terminal
and
to
enter
the
terminal
free
of
cost.
now
what
the
commission
was
it
referred
that
judge
friendly's
language
and
then
said
on
that
review,
we
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
we
don’t
contemplate
either
that
there
is
a
buyer
or
that
if
the
states
were
buy
it.
their
bargaining
power
would
not
be
so
great,
but
they
could
not
get
this
benefit
for
nothing
and
we
say
that
where
the
--
where
for
a
public
purpose,
a
valuable
property
right
such
as
that
is
being
obtained.
any
notion
of
just
compensation
requires
payment
they
afford
and
that
to
have
said,
we
would
simply
use
our
sovereign
power
to
take
this
valuable
right
and
pay
you
nothing
for
it,
was
to
say
something
which
the
commission
should
not
have
said
and
the
court
should
not
have
sustained.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
we
do
make
that
argument
for
going
concern
value.
but
i
would
say
this,
under
our
best
method
of
liquidation,
we
would
not
have
as
penn
central
says
on
page
98%
of
its
brief,
it
mustn't
assume
that
the
tracks,
or
assume
to
have
been
dismantled
and
would
attract
so
long
the
new
haven’s
right
away
torn
free
use
of
the
terminal
can
be
of
no
value
than
the
new
haven
because
that’s
not
a
proper
method
to
liquidate.
and
i
also
point
to
the
past
case
decided
in
new
york
where
you
have
the
same
situation,
you
have
something
that
was
of
use,
you
had
a
tunnel
but
the
hudson
manhattan
railroad
company
was
making
no
money
with
it
and
it
was
prepared
to
stop,
but
the
commuters
needed
the
service,
the
state
took
the
property
and
when
the
state
took
the
property,
it
did
not
attribute
a
zero
value
to
it
because
it
had
no
value
in
the
hands
of
hudson
manhattan
railroad
company,
it
attributed
a
fair
value
to
it
because
that’s
what
the
state
was
using
it
for.
it
took
it
for
a
purpose,
it
got
the
value
of
that
purpose
and
it
attributed.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
required
to
attribute
a
very
large
value
to
that
tunnel
and
they
say
that
there
is
essentially
no
difference
between
our
grand
central
situation
and
the
past
case.
and
i
can
not
spend
anymore
time
on
the
past
case,
but
i
do
think
that
a
careful
reading
of
that
case
will
show
that
the
circumstances
were
identical.
i
should
say
this,
if
i
could
add
more
word
on
the
grand
central
terminal's
question.
i
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
question
in
judge
friendly's
mind
as
to
what
value
would
be
put
in
any
event
upon
the
new
haven's
right
to
handle
the
terminal.
how
would
you
value
that
if
new
york
state
did
take
it
over?
and
i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
filled
here
by
new
york
and
connecticut,
which
are
filled
in
composition
to
our
being
given
any
credit
for
that
unique
valuable
right,
but
you
will
see
that
all
that
has
happened
now
is
that
the
states
in
penn
central
are
quarreling
over
the
division
of
the
spoils
here.
otherwise,
new
york
state
and
connecticut
would
now
have
no
interest
in
this
proceeding
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
also
that
2.17
million
can
be
derived
a
reading
of
those
briefs
as
the
minimum
value,
as
the
minimum
value
that
needs
to
be
capitalized
if
the
new
haven’s
right
in
the
grand
central
terminal
properties
as
equal
partner
is
to
be
vindicated.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
capitalized
value
as
far
as
5.6
million.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
capitalized
value
of
5.6
million
at
an
8%
rate
which
was
the
traditional
basis
that
was
used
in
this
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
would
come
to
70
million.
now
of
course
on
a
minimum
value
basis,
it
is
2.17
million
capitalized
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
we
know
that
because
that
is
what
in
effect
penn
central
is
paying
to
the
new
haven
in
order
to
give
to
new
york
and
connecticut
in
order
to
give
them
free
use
of
the
terminal
in
exchange
for
something
of
much
greater
benefit
to
them.
they
are
being
relieved
of
the
deficits
of
those
operations
altogether
and
new
york
and
connecticut
are
also
providing
a
lot
of
new
capital
improving
the
stations
and
so
on.
so
that
what
penn
central
has
realized
out
of
that
free
use
is
something
a
good
deal
more
than
2.17
million,
but
that
would
at
least
represent
a
floors
to
the
evaluation
of
new
haven’s
rights.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
27
million.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
talk
about
is
the
artificial
value
which
the
commission
placed
on
the
sales
of
stock
of
penn
central.
it
must
be
recalled
that
with
respect
to
the
evaluation
of
the
new
haven
property,
the
property
was
all
calculated
on
a
piece
by
piece
basis.
it
was
estimated
how
long
it
would
take
before
you
realize
those
values.
they
were
then
discounted
back
to
present
value
so
that
you
had
a
current
market
value
as
of
december
31,
1966
for
each
of
the
new
haven’s
pieces
of
property.
now
with
respect
to
some
of
the
items,
with
respect
to
the
bonds
for
example
the
penn
central
which
was
given
as
consideration
for
the
new
haven,
the
same
method
was
followed
there.
it
was
recognized
that
a
5%
bond
with
a
25-year
maturity
would
not
sell
at
par
and
therefore
a
15%
discount
was
given
in
order
to
fund
the
market
value
so
that
what
you
have
on
one
side
of
the
equation
liquidation
value,
you
would
have
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
liquidation
value
and
those
would
meet.
but
the
$83.1
million
did
not
represent
liquidation
value
at
any
point
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
represent
it
the
day
and
at
no
time,
not
since
the
liquidation
value
date
until
the
day
could
that
those
950,000
shares
have
been
liquidated
for
$83
million.
we
submit
that
the
right
there
on
which
the
value
of
those
shares
is
the
same
day
that
all
the
other
property
was
valued,
which
was
december
31,
1966
and
the
market
value
on
that
date
52
million,
but
was
approximately
$50
million
and
therefore
there
is
a
gap
of
some
$33
million.
there
was
some
argument
that
it
was
reasonable
to
value
the
shares
as
of
the
closing
date
because
after
all
that’s
when
we
gave
our
property
up
and
that
is
when
we
receive
the
property
back.
but
then
the
shares
had
a
value
of
$60
million
and
this
was
not
simply
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
was
in
december
of
1968.
so
what
you
have
left
is
either
a
gap
of
$33.million
or
a
gap
of
$23
million,
but
you
have
a
very
substantial
gap.
and
both
courts
recognize
that
that
would
not
work
and
so
judge
anderson
suggested
and
the
three-judge
court
accepted
an
underwriting.
judge
anderson
had
said,
well
by
1978
probably
it
will
be
worth
that.
and
if
it's
not,
then
in
1978
penn
central
will
pay
in
cash
the
difference
between
the
market
value
and
the
value
that
you
get
by
looking
at
averages
for
30
days
preceding
february
1,
1978.
now
we
submit
that
that
is
entirely
inequitable
treatment
here.
we
gave
up
property
that
had
as
the
commission
said
than
conservatively
than
it
had
a
cash
value
on
the
day
it
was
valued
and
had
a
cash
value
on
the
day
it
was
given
up.
judge
winfield
in
the
course
of
argument
on
this
very
point,
for
judge
winfield
agrees
with
us
that
the
courts
have
not
gone
far
enough
here.
judge
winfield
asked
the
question,
was
it
within
the
commission’s
power
to
order
that
this
be
paid
for
in
cash.
and
the
answer
to
that
was
yes.
now
it
did
not
order
it
be
paid
in
cash,
but
judge
winfield's
statement
that
it
should
have
been
paid
in
the
cash
equivalent
we
submit
is
exactly
right.
if
it
was
thought
too
burdensome
to
require
penn
central
either
to
add
to
its
fix
charges
by
issuing
bonds
or
by
raising
the
cash
to
have
penn
central
pay
for
it
shares.
that
was
easily
arranged
simply
by
the
addition
of
more
shares
which
would
have
had
no
effect
on
fix
charges
and
would
have
had
the
most
miniscule
effect
on
the
earnings
per
share
because
there
are
24
million
shares
of
penn
central
outstanding.
if
therefore
could
not
have
been
burdensome
to
penn
central
and
yet
it
would
have
provided
a
certain
funds
here
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
am
afraid
i
can't
answer
the
question?
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
in
any
event
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
there
are
shares
there
which
could
be
issued,
but
in
the
second
place,
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
penn
central
as
in
this
case
have
a
finance
docket.
penn
central
goes
to
the
commission
and
says,
“we
would
like
to
issue
shares
in
order
to
meet
this
obligation.”
the
commission
in
this
case
did
authorized
penn
central
to
issue
the
950,000
shares
and
could
have
authorized
the
issuance
of
more
than
950,000
shares
in
order
to
see
that
what
the
new
haven
received
was
the
equivalent
of
what
it
was
giving
away
what
seems
to
us
to
have
been
an
absolute
minimum.
but
when
you
are
dealing
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
never
once,
your
honor.
it
did
86,
but
it
has
actually
therein
--
it's
now
i
believe
at
something
like
25.
if
you
look
at
the
history
from
1962
until
now,
you
will
see
that
it's
had
a
history
of
being
at
14
and
climbing
up
and
coming
down
again.
and
penn
central
itself
acknowledges
that
it's
a
very
cyclical
situation.
it
talks
about
the
difficulties
of
starting
up
a
merger
and
one
thing
and
another
but
that
it
seems
to
us
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
in
this
case
we
were
entitled
to
be
paid
for
in
fact
it
was
nothing
but
a
sale
the
equivalent
of
what
we
gave
up.
now,
i
have
been
handed
this
morning
a
chart
which
i'm
afraid
i
am
unable
to
understand
with
which
i
understand
the
comi
--
which
i
understand
will
be
used
in
connection
with
the
argument
on
the
stock
point.
we
are
asked
throughout
we
had
said
that
what
the
commission
should
do
is
to
give
us
the
additional
shares
so
that
would
make
up
the
$83
million
because
there
was
never
any
mean
to
guess
as
to
what
the
market
price
would
be
on
the
date
of
closing
and
it
was
a
guess
made
by
kirk
that
the
date
of
closing
would
be
in
1970.
that
at
that
time
the
shares
would
play
between
75
and
100
and
splitting
that
difference
87.5
you
have
a
priced
which
multiplied
by
950,000
shares
gave
you
$83.1
million.
none
of
them
guessing
was
necessary
and
it
was
all
wrong.
we
didn't
close
in
1970.
we
closed
at
the
end
of
1968.
the
price
was
not
then
87.50.
it
never
reached
87.50.
the
price
then
was
63.38.
all
this
guesses
were
unnecessary
because
history
would
have
shown
the
fact
would
have
shown
just
what
the
price
had
to
be
and
it
was
there
that
the
commission
went
wrong.
and
judge
winfield
has
never
yet
accepted
that
and
has
said
that
it
ought
to
have
been
remanded
to
the
commission
so
that
the
commission
can
provide
the
cash
equivalent.
now
we
have
tried
not
to
interfere
with
the
underwriting
formula
farther
than
we
had
too
in
order
to
avoid
that
remand
because
this
proceeding
is
going
on
now
for
some
nine
years.
the
underwriting
in
a
certain
sense
does
ensure
if
there
are
some
small
corrections
made
to
it.
it
doesn't
ensure
that
we
will
eventually
receive
$83.1
million.
we
have
had
however
in
effect
just
a
part
payment.
that
part
payment
is
either
$60
million
or
a
$50
million
of
the
$83.1
million
and
the
balance
is
still
to
come.
we
are
general
creditors
in
effect
for
the
rest
but
we
have
none
even
a
purchased
money
mortgage
with
respect
to
that
balance
and
nobody
would
have
transferred
all
his
real
estate
here
for
a
part
payment
without
taking
back
at
least
the
purchase
money
mortgage.
the
underwriting
provides
us
no
security
but
that
payment
will
ever
be
made.
and
then
we
say
is
one
of
its
vices.
a
second
vice
that
we
assigned
of
the
underwriting
formula
is
this.
we
are
now
not
receiving
any
income
with
respect
either
to
the
23
or
33
millions
of
consideration
that
we
didn't
receive
and
so
we
have
said
we
ought
to
be
paid
interest
on
that.
and
that
interest
when
it
was
required
that
new
york
--
when
the
new
haven
was
borrowing
from
penn
central
under
the
loan
loss
formula
that
interest
was
at
the
prime
rate
and
we
submit
that,
that's
the
very
least
that
it
ought
to
be
paid
on
the
unpaid
portion
now.
there
is
one
other
deficiency
in
the
underwriting
and
with
that
correction
the
bondholders
could
accept
and
not
insist
on
the
balance
of
the
share.
judge
friendly
have
--
judge
anderson
have
provided
us
a
part
of
that
underwriting
formula,
that
if
penn
central
shares
traded
at
87.50
for
a
five-day
period
then
the
underwriting
would
terminate
and
of
course
we
only
look
for
interest
up
to
the
point
where
we
couldn’t
liquidate
and
get
83
million.
we're
not
looking
for
interest
rate
out
to
the
end
of
1978.
it
just
depends
on
when
finally
the
balance
of
the
payment
has
been
made
either
because
the
market
has
reappraised
penn
central
shares
or
because
penn
central
has
paid
them
all.
but
on
that
five-day
termination
of
the
underwriting,
we
submit
that
it's
unfair
to
use
so
limited
a
period
because
you
could
never
sell
in
the
market
could
never
absorbed
950,000
shares
at
that
price
simply
because
it
could
absorb
a
normal
day’s
trading
and
a
five-day
trading.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
if
we
put
them
on
the
market
and
offered
them
your
honor
then
we
would
immediately
collapse
the
price
account.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
we
don't
want
the
best
of
both
worlds,
your
honor.
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
underwriting
formula
contemplated,
that
penn
central
to
avoid
that
could
offer
to
pick
up
in
50
share
blocks
and
free
itself
for
the
underwriting
at
anytime
it
cared
too
by
paying
the
difference
between
the
then
market
value
in
87.50.
so
that
if
there
was
a
real
likelihood
that
that
--
that
the
best
of
that
of
the
other
side
of
the
world
would
possible
penn
central
itself
by
you
exercising
the
option
granted
in
the
underwriting
could
take
that
and
put
forth
itself
(voice
overlap)
that’s
right
your
honor,
that’s
right.
there
really
is
no
best
to
both
possible
worlds
here.
your
honor,
this
brings
me
to
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
that
is
the
terrible
unfairness
of
the
loan
loss
formula
and
the
way
in
which
it
has
worked
in
this
case.
the
loan
loss
formula,
we
submit,
was
simply
a
formula
by
which
the
erosion
was
permitted
to
continue.
and
by
making
available
to
the
new
haven
cash
so
that
it
could
continue
to
operated
at
a
deficient
not
paying
its
taxes,
not
paying
its
per
diem
charges,
not
paying
its
tort
claims.
the
formula
was
not
a
formula
for
the
relief
of
the
new
haven.
it
was
formula
which
imposed
for
the
losses
upon
the
new
haven
and
inevitably,
for
as
long
as
we
took
the
money
down
we
had
to
run
the
railroad
and
we
had
to
lose
money.
now
when
this
matter
was
before
the
court
the
last
time,
the
notion
was
that
we
were
only
going
to
have
a
very
small
loss
because
the
formula
would
take
care
of
all
the
new
haven's
losses
and
it
was
predicted
that,
that
loss
would
be
small.
you
will
recall
it
was
in
a
descending
scale.
penn
central
was
to
contribute
a
100%
of
a
first
year
losses
and
then
50%
and
25%
that
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
about
that
in
his
dissent.
now
what
has
happened
is
that
we
did
close
in
the
first
year
and
having
close
in
the
first
year,
the
losses
that
were
contributed
under
the
commission
formula
was
only
$5
million
but
the
commission
knew
one
month
before
it
ordered
the
closing.
in
november
of
1968
when
it
handed
down
the
remand
report
that
it's
guess
that
those
losses
would
be
small
and
that
the
$5
million
would
therefore
cover
just
about
all
of
the
new
haven's
losses.
they
knew
then
that
that
was
untrue
that
the
losses
were
much,
much
greater.
nevertheless,
in
spite
of
our
urging
they
persisted
in
saying
that
was
as
far
as
they'd
go.
now
i
submit
that
if
the
commission
was
right
in
saying
that
it
was
fair
for
penn
central
to
bear
a
100%
of
the
first
year
losses,
it
should
have
not
withdrawn
from
that
at
the
point
when
it
found
that
the
losses
were
larger
than
they
anticipated
because
it
was
certainly
unfair
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
bondholders
were
required
to
absorb
$70
million
of
losses,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
$70
billion
was
--
$70
millions,
i
submit
to
you
that
that
$70
million
was
$10
million
more
than
the
total
value
with
the
950,000
shares
we
got.
we
were
being
eliminated,
we
were
being
obliterated
here
and
then
the
say
to
that
100%
of
the
losses
should
be
altered
in
the
last
year
and
limited
to
that
$5
million
imposing
$6
million
on
the
new
haven
that
was
improper.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
commission
has
acknowledged
that
liquidation
value
was
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
with
respect
to
the
property
of
the
new
haven.
it
has
failed
in
several
instances
to
give
that
liquidation
value
because
it
has
not
understood.
but
when
you
go
to
find
liquidation
value,
what
you
must
find
is
what
the
liquidator
of
that
property
would
receive
if
he
sold
it
in
the
method
that
was
best
suited
to
his
disposition.
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
the
bulk
sale
discount
and
it
is
what
is
wrong
with
the
harlem
river
evaluation.
and
that
was
the
question
that
judge
anderson
and
judge
winfield
address
themselves
to.
what
you
have
in
those
two
yards
were
simply
the
question
of
whether
there
would
or
would
be
not
rail
service
available
to
the
industrial
uses
of
those
two
yards
in
the
event
of
liquidation.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards?
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
the
point.
now
there
isn't
any
question
of
the
two
values,
of
the
only
two
values
we
need
to
look
at
here.
that
is
to
say
it
is
either
the
18
million
or
the
22
and
a
half
million
because
the
testimony
is
the
testimony
of
a
same
man
mr.
mckean
and
one
represents
a
discount
he
took
on
certain
liquidation
assumptions
which
were
furnished
to
him
and
those
liquidation
assumptions
were
that
all
of
the
electric
power
would
be
turned
off.
there
would
be
no
power
to
the
property.
although
this
was
property
just
adjacent
to
the
consolidated
edison
power
plant
and
all
the
tracks
would
be
torn
up.
now
i
submit
that
that
was
not
new
haven's
best
method
of
liquidation.
one
other
thing
is
the
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
the
problem
that
you
face
here
is
what
you
mean
when
you
say
scrap
value,
what
you
mean
when
you
say
net
salvage
value.
now,
i
say
that
what
you
mean
when
you
say
net
salvage
value
is
the
best
use
you
can
make
of
it.
and
in
this
case,
to
have
torn
up
the
tracks,
to
have
taken
out
the
electric
power
would
first
have
depreciated
its
value
of
the
new
haven’s
asset
and
then
to
have
sold
the
portion
of
it
as
junk
and
the
balance
of
it
for
whatever
you
could
get
for
it
and
no
sensible
liquidator
would
have
liquidated
in
that
way.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
judge
winfield
and
judge
anderson
both
said
that
it
was
simply
impermissible
to
permit
the
assumption,
the
basis
here
of
liquidation
to
assume
that
there
would
be
no
service
available.
they
were
aware
that
new
york
city
had
built
a
hunts
point
market
and
that
it
had
spent
a
hundred
million
dollars
on
that.
it
was
a
food
lifeline
in
new
york.
it
was
being
served
then
by
a
small
piece
of
track
which
ran
--
if
you
think
of
it
as
running
north,
it
is
3,000
feet
between
the
harlem
river
yards
up
to
a
point
where
it
meets
the
port
morris
branch
of
pennsylvania
central
which
was
not
liquidated.
and
thence,
the
two
yards,
the
oak
point
yard
and
the
port
morris
yard
being
cheek
by
jowl,
there
is
a
switch
point
there
that
comes
on
to
the
new
haven
and
it
continues
on
up.
in
another
mile,
there
is
a
spare
track
and
that
spare
track
goes
another
mile
with
hunts
point
yards
and
therefore,
they
have
never
seemed
that
judge
anderson
the
possibility.
either
for
the
liquidator
would
tear
up
to
the
track
and
in
that
way
make
it
impossible
to
realize
the
value
he
could
on
the
sale
of
his
136
acres
in
the
harlem
river
yards
and
in
the
oak
point
yards
and
at
the
same
time
make
it
impossible
for
new
york
city
to
have
the
rail
service
that
it
required.
because
most
of
this
--
for
99%
of
its
distance,
this
came
in
on
pennsylvania
cost
and
was
then
switched
at
the
port
morris
yard
and
then
went
to
hunts
point.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
your
honor
on
this
point
there
is
no
remand
to
the
commission
because
i
think
that
record
is
to
perfectly
clear
that
if
you
find
that
these
yards
and
that's
right.
there
is
one
question
however
that
does
raise
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
remand.
in
the
valuation
when
the
--
when
you
consider
the
possibility
that
the
mile
and
a
half
of
track
would
be
torn
up,
you
then
have
to
consider
that
on
the
liquidation
hypothesis
that
that
track
would
continue
even
if
the
new
haven
for
example
had
to
give
that
track
to
new
york
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
traffic
continue,
then
the
value
of
the
right
of
way,
which
is
about
$500,000
might
have
to
be
subtracted
from
the
22
and
a
half
million
dollars
because
then
you
would
have
valued
it
twice.
however,
judge
anderson
clearly
felt
that
there
was
no
danger
that
new
york
city
would
pay
a
fair
price
for
that
right
of
way
in
order
to
preserve
the
service
to
the
hunts
point
yards
and
therefore
he
did
not
make
that
deduction.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
so
perfectly
plain
incorrect.
that
it
does
not
need
to
be
remand
again
the
value
of
that
small
piece
of
right
of
way
which
at
worst
would
have
been
donated
to
new
york
city
or
to
the
development
of
the
hunts
point
and
of
the
oak
point
and
harlem
river
yards.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
it
is
3,000
feet
from
the
harlem
river
yards
to
the
oak
point
yards
switch
with
penn
central's
port
morris
branch,
then
it
runs
on
another
mile
until
it
meets
the
spare
track
to
the
hunts
point
market.
in
a
certain
sense,
this
unwillingness
to
permit
the
new
haven
its
real
liquidation
value
while
always
ascertaining
that
liquidation
value
is
what
is
being
granted,
the
commission’s
treatment
of
the
grand
central
terminal
is
another
case
in
point.
for
there,
the
new
haven
enjoys
the
right
or
enjoyed
the
right
until
the
closing
of
bringing
its
trains
into
the
station
and
that
had
this
partly
by
charters
that
which
went
back
to
the
1840’s
and
it
had
it
partly
by
virtue
of
agreements,
which
had
made
with
the
central.
now
that
right
permitted
the
new
haven
to
operate
its
trains
into
the
station
and
out
of
all
of
the
terminal
properties
and
here,
we
are
not
talking
simply
about
the
station
income
itself.
we
are
talking
about
all
of
the
park
avenue
properties
in
all
of
the
area
income.
by
agreement,
these
were
being
put
into
the
terminal
account
and
all
the
expenses
were
coming
out
of
the
terminal
account
to
pay
the
expenses
of
both
railroads,
central
and
the
new
haven
in
the
station.
now
obviously,
this
income
grew
as
the
real
estate
developed
and
it
has
become
more
profitable.
in
1907,
this
was
a
pretty
remote
part
of
new
york
city
but
that
change
in
time.
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
as
the
income
increased,
the
difference
between
the
actual
expenses
and
the
income
from
the
properties
began
to
disappear
and
therefore
the
parties
each
year
have
to
contribute
less
and
less
out
of
their
own
pockets
in
order
to
meet
the
expenses
of
their
operations
in
the
terminal
and
all
of
the
expenses
of
the
property.
and
there
came
a
time
in
1964
and
thereafter
when
in
fact
there
was
more
income
coming
in
than
the
total
of
the
expenses
both
for
the
fixed
charges
and
taxes
on
the
real
estate
and
the
operating
cost.
now
when
that
happened,
there
was
excess
income.
so
that
a
question
then
arose
as
to
what
the
division
of
the
excess
income
should
be
between
the
parties
so
that
you've
got
excess
income
and
terminal
income
as
the
way
in
which
i
have
divided
it
now
for
this
discussion
and
i
hope
that
all
of
that
is
clear.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct
your
honor,
though
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
the
$5.6
million.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
yet
it
is
extremely
important
understand
how
the
issue
with
respect
to
the
excess
income
settle.
in
the
first
instance,
central
had
denied
that
the
new
haven
had
any
right
in
the
income,
those
properties
produced
in
the
event,
but
the
new
haven
stopped
the
operation.
now
as
a
result
of
that
in
the
negotiations
between
the
trustee
and
penn
central,
no
value
was
allowed
for
that
and
we
argue
that
that
was
all
wrong,
it
was
all
wrong
because
this
matter
had
been
the
nature
of
the
new
haven's
interest
studies
had
been
litigated
in
the
new
york
courts.
it
had
gone
all
the
way
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
new
haven
was
in
effect
an
equal
partner
with
the
central
in
the
management
of
those
properties
and
treated
them
as
joint
venture.
the
commission
however
on
the
first
ground
gave
us
this
small
value
of
$13
million
because
it
considered
that
it
ought
to
--
it
considered
in
the
first
place
but
there
was
a
great
question
as
to
whether
it
would
survive
in
spite
of
the
rule
in
the
baltimore
case
as
to
whether
we
have
a
real
interest.
and
on
the
second
place
it
considered
that
it
ought
to
use
as
either
end
of
the
equation
41%
on
one
side
because
that
was
our
traditional
car
use
in
the
station.
and
$5
million
which
was
a
certain
nuisance
value
attributable
to
the
claim
and
it
split
the
difference
and
came
out
with
$13
million
and
it
was
important
that
at
this
point,
judge
van
voorhis
was
named
to
look
into
the
question
because
the
result
of
his
decision
was
to
declare
that
the
new
haven
railroad
was
in
fact
an
equal
partner
and
that
it
was
an
equal
partner
in
an
indefeasible
way.
and
therefore,
the
new
haven's
interest
in
that
excess
income,
the
profits
from
the
operations
had
to
be
fully
valued
and
we
have
to
be
fully
paid.
and
they
say
that
its
declaration
that
we
were
an
equal
partner
and
that
that
interest
was
in
fact
indefeasible.
it
is
very
important
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
what
ought
to
have
happened
to
the
$5.6
million.
what
we
had
is
penn
central's
witnesses
themselves
testified
to
was
the
greatest
bargaining
history.
we
had
a
right
to
come
in
to
that
terminal
with
our
trains
and
because
the
terminal
income
was
so
great,
we
did
not
have
to
pay
for
it.
and
therefore,
the
question
is,
why
now
when
that
valuable
interest
is
turned
over
to
penn
central
so
that
penn
central
can
perform
the
service
we
formally
performed
and
perform
it
without
cost
because
it’s
utilizing
the
same
income.
why
should
penn
central
not
be
required
to
pay
for
it?
now
i
must
say
that
if
you
read
judge
friendly's
opinion
on
this
point,
you
will
see
on
the
first
round
of
review,
you
will
see
that
essentially
there
was
only
one
ground
in
spite
of
all
the
grounds
that
i
finally
talked
about.
there
is
only
one
ground
that
really
determined
his
decision
and
that
was
his
view
whether
if
we
stop
running,
if
the
new
haven
stopped
operating,
whether
anybody
would
acquire
our
right,
whether
anybody
would
be
interested
in
doing
that
or
whether
it
was
so
speculative
that
somebody
would
acquire
that
right
that
we
ought
not
to
be
paid
for
it.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
was
inevitable
that
somebody
would
acquire
it
because
if
nobody
would
acquire
it,
then
precisely
what
the
chief
justice
adverted
to
with
respect
when
he
spoke
to
mr.
seymour
would
have
occurred.
this
would
have
gone
on
until
we
would
have
been
drained
of
all
equity.
on
the
one
hand,
we
will
not
permit
to
stop
the
operations
because
it
was
vital
to
the
public
interest.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
conceived
by
judge
friendly
that
there
might
not
be
somebody
who
would
pick
up
that
service
and
would
perform
it
for
its
own
people.
now
that
i
submit
was
simply
unreasonable.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
that
we
submit
would
have
worked
both
an
inequitable
result
and
an
unconstitutional
one.
to
say
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
in
part
are,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
if
that
was
one
of
the
statements
made
at
one
point
in
the
case
and
i
think
that
i
must
fairly
admit
it,
though
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
the
fundamental
one.
i
think
the
fundamental
point
was
that
it
was
too
speculative
that
the
states
would
acquire
it
and
therefore
to
speculative
to
value
that
right.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
judge
friendly’s
opinion,
you
will
note
that
he
says
that
it
was
possible
to
conceive
of
the
possibility
that
the
service
would
only
be
acquired
as
far
as
woodlawn.
and
in
woodlawn,
those
30,000
daily
passengers
would
be
discharged
each
morning
to
walk
four
blocks
to
the
nearest
bronx
subway
station
and
then
they
could
find
their
way
to
work
somehow
and
then
go
back
in
the
evening
the
same
way.
and
i
submit
that
that
simply
was
an
impractical
solution
that
judge
friendly
should
have
noticed
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
commission
should
have
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
that
there
was
no
possibility
that
that
service
would
cease.
new
york
and
connecticut
had
testified
repeatedly
in
the
train
discontinuance
case
for
example.
but
that
was
essential
to
their
citizens
and
that
they
were
prepared
to
pay
for
it
and
to
produce
it.
now
we
are
here
today
in
a
new
posture
of
this
case
because
an
authority
was
formed
in
fact
by
the
states
of
new
york
and
connecticut.
they
have
in
fact
entered
into
an
agreement
with
penn
central
to
operate
bank
service.
now
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
it
could
not
be
operated
into
the
terminal
unless
there
was
lease
from
penn
central
to
a
new
user.
now
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
felt
that
--
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
on
earlier
case
decided
in
this
court
by
judge
cardozo.
judge
cardozo
in
describing
the
new
haven's
interest
there
said
that
it
was
the
value
under
the
agreement
of
the
right
to
use
terminal.
but
while
we
did
not
have
the
fee,
we
did
have
this
valuable
right.
judge
friendly
himself
refers
to
it
as
a
unique
right,
but
he
questions
what
value
should
be
put
on
it
if
in
the
end,
we
are
trying
to
cease
operations
and
as
he
says,
no
one
will
acquire.
now
that
we
think
is
where
the
mistake
was.
new
york
and
connecticut
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
end-result,
you
were
correct,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
am
attacking
judge
friendly's
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
think
that
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
this,
judge
anderson
harbored
and
still
harbors
great
doubts
to
the
correctness
of
that
result.
judge
anderson
always
felt
that
some
value
should
be
placed
on
that
and
he
therefore
remanded
to
the
commission
the
first
time
and
asked
them
to
find
what
value
if
any
inhered
in
the
new
haven's
right
to
enter
the
terminal
and
to
enter
the
terminal
free
of
cost.
now
what
the
commission
was
it
referred
that
judge
friendly's
language
and
then
said
on
that
review,
we
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
we
don’t
contemplate
either
that
there
is
a
buyer
or
that
if
the
states
were
buy
it.
their
bargaining
power
would
not
be
so
great,
but
they
could
not
get
this
benefit
for
nothing
and
we
say
that
where
the
--
where
for
a
public
purpose,
a
valuable
property
right
such
as
that
is
being
obtained.
any
notion
of
just
compensation
requires
payment
they
afford
and
that
to
have
said,
we
would
simply
use
our
sovereign
power
to
take
this
valuable
right
and
pay
you
nothing
for
it,
was
to
say
something
which
the
commission
should
not
have
said
and
the
court
should
not
have
sustained.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
we
do
make
that
argument
for
going
concern
value.
but
i
would
say
this,
under
our
best
method
of
liquidation,
we
would
not
have
as
penn
central
says
on
page
98%
of
its
brief,
it
mustn't
assume
that
the
tracks,
or
assume
to
have
been
dismantled
and
would
attract
so
long
the
new
haven’s
right
away
torn
free
use
of
the
terminal
can
be
of
no
value
than
the
new
haven
because
that’s
not
a
proper
method
to
liquidate.
and
i
also
point
to
the
past
case
decided
in
new
york
where
you
have
the
same
situation,
you
have
something
that
was
of
use,
you
had
a
tunnel
but
the
hudson
manhattan
railroad
company
was
making
no
money
with
it
and
it
was
prepared
to
stop,
but
the
commuters
needed
the
service,
the
state
took
the
property
and
when
the
state
took
the
property,
it
did
not
attribute
a
zero
value
to
it
because
it
had
no
value
in
the
hands
of
hudson
manhattan
railroad
company,
it
attributed
a
fair
value
to
it
because
that’s
what
the
state
was
using
it
for.
it
took
it
for
a
purpose,
it
got
the
value
of
that
purpose
and
it
attributed.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
required
to
attribute
a
very
large
value
to
that
tunnel
and
they
say
that
there
is
essentially
no
difference
between
our
grand
central
situation
and
the
past
case.
and
i
can
not
spend
anymore
time
on
the
past
case,
but
i
do
think
that
a
careful
reading
of
that
case
will
show
that
the
circumstances
were
identical.
i
should
say
this,
if
i
could
add
more
word
on
the
grand
central
terminal's
question.
i
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
question
in
judge
friendly's
mind
as
to
what
value
would
be
put
in
any
event
upon
the
new
haven's
right
to
handle
the
terminal.
how
would
you
value
that
if
new
york
state
did
take
it
over?
and
i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
briefs
filled
here
by
new
york
and
connecticut,
which
are
filled
in
composition
to
our
being
given
any
credit
for
that
unique
valuable
right,
but
you
will
see
that
all
that
has
happened
now
is
that
the
states
in
penn
central
are
quarreling
over
the
division
of
the
spoils
here.
otherwise,
new
york
state
and
connecticut
would
now
have
no
interest
in
this
proceeding
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
also
that
2.17
million
can
be
derived
a
reading
of
those
briefs
as
the
minimum
value,
as
the
minimum
value
that
needs
to
be
capitalized
if
the
new
haven’s
right
in
the
grand
central
terminal
properties
as
equal
partner
is
to
be
vindicated.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
capitalized
value
as
far
as
5.6
million.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
the
capitalized
value
of
5.6
million
at
an
8%
rate
which
was
the
traditional
basis
that
was
used
in
this
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
would
come
to
70
million.
now
of
course
on
a
minimum
value
basis,
it
is
2.17
million
capitalized
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
we
know
that
because
that
is
what
in
effect
penn
central
is
paying
to
the
new
haven
in
order
to
give
to
new
york
and
connecticut
in
order
to
give
them
free
use
of
the
terminal
in
exchange
for
something
of
much
greater
benefit
to
them.
they
are
being
relieved
of
the
deficits
of
those
operations
altogether
and
new
york
and
connecticut
are
also
providing
a
lot
of
new
capital
improving
the
stations
and
so
on.
so
that
what
penn
central
has
realized
out
of
that
free
use
is
something
a
good
deal
more
than
2.17
million,
but
that
would
at
least
represent
a
floors
to
the
evaluation
of
new
haven’s
rights.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
27
million.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
talk
about
is
the
artificial
value
which
the
commission
placed
on
the
sales
of
stock
of
penn
central.
it
must
be
recalled
that
with
respect
to
the
evaluation
of
the
new
haven
property,
the
property
was
all
calculated
on
a
piece
by
piece
basis.
it
was
estimated
how
long
it
would
take
before
you
realize
those
values.
they
were
then
discounted
back
to
present
value
so
that
you
had
a
current
market
value
as
of
december
31,
1966
for
each
of
the
new
haven’s
pieces
of
property.
now
with
respect
to
some
of
the
items,
with
respect
to
the
bonds
for
example
the
penn
central
which
was
given
as
consideration
for
the
new
haven,
the
same
method
was
followed
there.
it
was
recognized
that
a
5%
bond
with
a
25-year
maturity
would
not
sell
at
par
and
therefore
a
15%
discount
was
given
in
order
to
fund
the
market
value
so
that
what
you
have
on
one
side
of
the
equation
liquidation
value,
you
would
have
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
liquidation
value
and
those
would
meet.
but
the
$83.1
million
did
not
represent
liquidation
value
at
any
point
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
represent
it
the
day
and
at
no
time,
not
since
the
liquidation
value
date
until
the
day
could
that
those
950,000
shares
have
been
liquidated
for
$83
million.
we
submit
that
the
right
there
on
which
the
value
of
those
shares
is
the
same
day
that
all
the
other
property
was
valued,
which
was
december
31,
1966
and
the
market
value
on
that
date
52
million,
but
was
approximately
$50
million
and
therefore
there
is
a
gap
of
some
$33
million.
there
was
some
argument
that
it
was
reasonable
to
value
the
shares
as
of
the
closing
date
because
after
all
that’s
when
we
gave
our
property
up
and
that
is
when
we
receive
the
property
back.
but
then
the
shares
had
a
value
of
$60
million
and
this
was
not
simply
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
was
in
december
of
1968.
so
what
you
have
left
is
either
a
gap
of
$33.million
or
a
gap
of
$23
million,
but
you
have
a
very
substantial
gap.
and
both
courts
recognize
that
that
would
not
work
and
so
judge
anderson
suggested
and
the
three-judge
court
accepted
an
underwriting.
judge
anderson
had
said,
well
by
1978
probably
it
will
be
worth
that.
and
if
it's
not,
then
in
1978
penn
central
will
pay
in
cash
the
difference
between
the
market
value
and
the
value
that
you
get
by
looking
at
averages
for
30
days
preceding
february
1,
1978.
now
we
submit
that
that
is
entirely
inequitable
treatment
here.
we
gave
up
property
that
had
as
the
commission
said
than
conservatively
than
it
had
a
cash
value
on
the
day
it
was
valued
and
had
a
cash
value
on
the
day
it
was
given
up.
judge
winfield
in
the
course
of
argument
on
this
very
point,
for
judge
winfield
agrees
with
us
that
the
courts
have
not
gone
far
enough
here.
judge
winfield
asked
the
question,
was
it
within
the
commission’s
power
to
order
that
this
be
paid
for
in
cash.
and
the
answer
to
that
was
yes.
now
it
did
not
order
it
be
paid
in
cash,
but
judge
winfield's
statement
that
it
should
have
been
paid
in
the
cash
equivalent
we
submit
is
exactly
right.
if
it
was
thought
too
burdensome
to
require
penn
central
either
to
add
to
its
fix
charges
by
issuing
bonds
or
by
raising
the
cash
to
have
penn
central
pay
for
it
shares.
that
was
easily
arranged
simply
by
the
addition
of
more
shares
which
would
have
had
no
effect
on
fix
charges
and
would
have
had
the
most
miniscule
effect
on
the
earnings
per
share
because
there
are
24
million
shares
of
penn
central
outstanding.
if
therefore
could
not
have
been
burdensome
to
penn
central
and
yet
it
would
have
provided
a
certain
funds
here
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
i
am
afraid
i
can't
answer
the
question?
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
in
any
event
that
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
there
are
shares
there
which
could
be
issued,
but
in
the
second
place,
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
penn
central
as
in
this
case
have
a
finance
docket.
penn
central
goes
to
the
commission
and
says,
“we
would
like
to
issue
shares
in
order
to
meet
this
obligation.”
the
commission
in
this
case
did
authorized
penn
central
to
issue
the
950,000
shares
and
could
have
authorized
the
issuance
of
more
than
950,000
shares
in
order
to
see
that
what
the
new
haven
received
was
the
equivalent
of
what
it
was
giving
away
what
seems
to
us
to
have
been
an
absolute
minimum.
but
when
you
are
dealing
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
never
once,
your
honor.
it
did
86,
but
it
has
actually
therein
--
it's
now
i
believe
at
something
like
25.
if
you
look
at
the
history
from
1962
until
now,
you
will
see
that
it's
had
a
history
of
being
at
14
and
climbing
up
and
coming
down
again.
and
penn
central
itself
acknowledges
that
it's
a
very
cyclical
situation.
it
talks
about
the
difficulties
of
starting
up
a
merger
and
one
thing
and
another
but
that
it
seems
to
us
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
in
this
case
we
were
entitled
to
be
paid
for
in
fact
it
was
nothing
but
a
sale
the
equivalent
of
what
we
gave
up.
now,
i
have
been
handed
this
morning
a
chart
which
i'm
afraid
i
am
unable
to
understand
with
which
i
understand
the
comi
--
which
i
understand
will
be
used
in
connection
with
the
argument
on
the
stock
point.
we
are
asked
throughout
we
had
said
that
what
the
commission
should
do
is
to
give
us
the
additional
shares
so
that
would
make
up
the
$83
million
because
there
was
never
any
mean
to
guess
as
to
what
the
market
price
would
be
on
the
date
of
closing
and
it
was
a
guess
made
by
kirk
that
the
date
of
closing
would
be
in
1970.
that
at
that
time
the
shares
would
play
between
75
and
100
and
splitting
that
difference
87.5
you
have
a
priced
which
multiplied
by
950,000
shares
gave
you
$83.1
million.
none
of
them
guessing
was
necessary
and
it
was
all
wrong.
we
didn't
close
in
1970.
we
closed
at
the
end
of
1968.
the
price
was
not
then
87.50.
it
never
reached
87.50.
the
price
then
was
63.38.
all
this
guesses
were
unnecessary
because
history
would
have
shown
the
fact
would
have
shown
just
what
the
price
had
to
be
and
it
was
there
that
the
commission
went
wrong.
and
judge
winfield
has
never
yet
accepted
that
and
has
said
that
it
ought
to
have
been
remanded
to
the
commission
so
that
the
commission
can
provide
the
cash
equivalent.
now
we
have
tried
not
to
interfere
with
the
underwriting
formula
farther
than
we
had
too
in
order
to
avoid
that
remand
because
this
proceeding
is
going
on
now
for
some
nine
years.
the
underwriting
in
a
certain
sense
does
ensure
if
there
are
some
small
corrections
made
to
it.
it
doesn't
ensure
that
we
will
eventually
receive
$83.1
million.
we
have
had
however
in
effect
just
a
part
payment.
that
part
payment
is
either
$60
million
or
a
$50
million
of
the
$83.1
million
and
the
balance
is
still
to
come.
we
are
general
creditors
in
effect
for
the
rest
but
we
have
none
even
a
purchased
money
mortgage
with
respect
to
that
balance
and
nobody
would
have
transferred
all
his
real
estate
here
for
a
part
payment
without
taking
back
at
least
the
purchase
money
mortgage.
the
underwriting
provides
us
no
security
but
that
payment
will
ever
be
made.
and
then
we
say
is
one
of
its
vices.
a
second
vice
that
we
assigned
of
the
underwriting
formula
is
this.
we
are
now
not
receiving
any
income
with
respect
either
to
the
23
or
33
millions
of
consideration
that
we
didn't
receive
and
so
we
have
said
we
ought
to
be
paid
interest
on
that.
and
that
interest
when
it
was
required
that
new
york
--
when
the
new
haven
was
borrowing
from
penn
central
under
the
loan
loss
formula
that
interest
was
at
the
prime
rate
and
we
submit
that,
that's
the
very
least
that
it
ought
to
be
paid
on
the
unpaid
portion
now.
there
is
one
other
deficiency
in
the
underwriting
and
with
that
correction
the
bondholders
could
accept
and
not
insist
on
the
balance
of
the
share.
judge
friendly
have
--
judge
anderson
have
provided
us
a
part
of
that
underwriting
formula,
that
if
penn
central
shares
traded
at
87.50
for
a
five-day
period
then
the
underwriting
would
terminate
and
of
course
we
only
look
for
interest
up
to
the
point
where
we
couldn’t
liquidate
and
get
83
million.
we're
not
looking
for
interest
rate
out
to
the
end
of
1978.
it
just
depends
on
when
finally
the
balance
of
the
payment
has
been
made
either
because
the
market
has
reappraised
penn
central
shares
or
because
penn
central
has
paid
them
all.
but
on
that
five-day
termination
of
the
underwriting,
we
submit
that
it's
unfair
to
use
so
limited
a
period
because
you
could
never
sell
in
the
market
could
never
absorbed
950,000
shares
at
that
price
simply
because
it
could
absorb
a
normal
day’s
trading
and
a
five-day
trading.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
--
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
if
we
put
them
on
the
market
and
offered
them
your
honor
then
we
would
immediately
collapse
the
price
account.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lester
c.
migdal
we
don't
want
the
best
of
both
worlds,
your
honor.
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
underwriting
formula
contemplated,
that
penn
central
to
avoid
that
could
offer
to
pick
up
in
50
share
blocks
and
free
itself
for
the
underwriting
at
anytime
it
cared
too
by
paying
the
difference
between
the
then
market
value
in
87.50.
so
that
if
there
was
a
real
likelihood
that
that
--
that
the
best
of
that
of
the
other
side
of
the
world
would
possible
penn
central
itself
by
you
exercising
the
option
granted
in
the
underwriting
could
take
that
and
put
forth
itself
(voice
overlap)
that’s
right
your
honor,
that’s
right.
there
really
is
no
best
to
both
possible
worlds
here.
your
honor,
this
brings
me
to
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
that
is
the
terrible
unfairness
of
the
loan
loss
formula
and
the
way
in
which
it
has
worked
in
this
case.
the
loan
loss
formula,
we
submit,
was
simply
a
formula
by
which
the
erosion
was
permitted
to
continue.
and
by
making
available
to
the
new
haven
cash
so
that
it
could
continue
to
operated
at
a
deficient
not
paying
its
taxes,
not
paying
its
per
diem
charges,
not
paying
its
tort
claims.
the
formula
was
not
a
formula
for
the
relief
of
the
new
haven.
it
was
formula
which
imposed
for
the
losses
upon
the
new
haven
and
inevitably,
for
as
long
as
we
took
the
money
down
we
had
to
run
the
railroad
and
we
had
to
lose
money.
now
when
this
matter
was
before
the
court
the
last
time,
the
notion
was
that
we
were
only
going
to
have
a
very
small
loss
because
the
formula
would
take
care
of
all
the
new
haven's
losses
and
it
was
predicted
that,
that
loss
would
be
small.
you
will
recall
it
was
in
a
descending
scale.
penn
central
was
to
contribute
a
100%
of
a
first
year
losses
and
then
50%
and
25%
that
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
about
that
in
his
dissent.
now
what
has
happened
is
that
we
did
close
in
the
first
year
and
having
close
in
the
first
year,
the
losses
that
were
contributed
under
the
commission
formula
was
only
$5
million
but
the
commission
knew
one
month
before
it
ordered
the
closing.
in
november
of
1968
when
it
handed
down
the
remand
report
that
it's
guess
that
those
losses
would
be
small
and
that
the
$5
million
would
therefore
cover
just
about
all
of
the
new
haven's
losses.
they
knew
then
that
that
was
untrue
that
the
losses
were
much,
much
greater.
nevertheless,
in
spite
of
our
urging
they
persisted
in
saying
that
was
as
far
as
they'd
go.
now
i
submit
that
if
the
commission
was
right
in
saying
that
it
was
fair
for
penn
central
to
bear
a
100%
of
the
first
year
losses,
it
should
have
not
withdrawn
from
that
at
the
point
when
it
found
that
the
losses
were
larger
than
they
anticipated
because
it
was
certainly
unfair
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
bondholders
were
required
to
absorb
$70
million
of
losses,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
$70
billion
was
--
$70
millions,
i
submit
to
you
that
that
$70
million
was
$10
million
more
than
the
total
value
with
the
950,000
shares
we
got.
we
were
being
eliminated,
we
were
being
obliterated
here
and
then
the
say
to
that
100%
of
the
losses
should
be
altered
in
the
last
year
and
limited
to
that
$5
million
imposing
$6
million
on
the
new
haven
that
was
improper.
