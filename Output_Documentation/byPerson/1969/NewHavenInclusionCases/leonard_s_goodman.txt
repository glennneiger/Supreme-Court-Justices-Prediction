mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
involved
the
fairness
of
a
reorganization
plan
for
the
new
haven
railroad
and
at
the
same
time
the
fairness
of
the
terms
where
the
inclusion
of
that
railroad
into
the
newly
merged
penn
central
railroad.
three
organization
plan
was
made
possible
because
of
the
happenchance
that
during
the
course
of
the
new
haven
bankruptcy,
penn
and
new
york
central
applied
for
permission
to
merge.
in
this
merger,
the
new
haven
trustees
saw
both
a
threat
and
an
opportunity
as
their
counsel
stated
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1967.
inclusion
in
penn
central,
in
the
view
of
the
trustees
afforded
the
only
practicable
means
for
reorganization
of
the
debtor
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
best
interest
of
the
public
and
of
all
parties
interested
in
the
debtor's
estate.
they
quickly
filed
for
inclusion
in
1962
within
three
months
after
penn
and
central
asked
permission
to
merge.
under
decision
of
this
court
the
commission
had
no
power
to
force
the
inclusion.
at
all
stages,
the
inclusion
depended
on
the
volition
of
the
owners
of
the
new
haven
for
five
years
until
1967.
no
bondholder
objected
to
the
course
being
pursued
by
the
trustees
and
at
that
time
the
reorganization
court
rejected
the
sole
objection
presented
by
the
committee
since
that
objection
failed
to
receive
the
support
of
either
manufacturers
or
chase.
now
this
is
been
a
long
and
difficult
assignment
for
the
commission.
in
no
reorganization
has
the
process
of
valuation
been
more
meticulous
or
more
carefully
supervised
by
the
courts.
the
oral
hearings
in
1967
extended
over
37
days
in
over
a
period
of
five
months
during
the
period
of
five
months.
further
hearings
were
held
before
a
special
master
of
the
reorganization
court
and
then
more
hearings
before
the
commission
on
remand
of
the
inclusion
report.
the
entire
commission
considered
and
reconsidered
this
extensive
record
in
three
reports
dealing
with
the
valuation.
the
bondholders’
initial
approach
before
the
commission
was
to
value
the
new
haven
as
a
freight
only
railroad.
this
was
not
merely
in
response
to
evidence
presented
by
penn
central
but
rather
they
apply
to
the
reorganization
court
for
order
number
324
in
july
of
1965
for
funds
to
complete
such
a
study
and
at
the
pre-hearing
conference
in
1966,
they
announced
that
“studies
are
being
made
with
a
view
to
evaluating
the
railroad
as
a
freight
only
operation”
and
the
study
was
in
fact
presented
in
the
hearings
in
1967.
it
may
--
it
might
have
been
possible
to
reorganize
a
portion
of
the
railroad
to
provide
freight
service.
it
was
not
explored
in
any
depth
by
the
commission
since
the
study
presented
by
the
bondholders
did
not
project
freight
only
earnings
beyond
the
year
1965.
the
valuation
of
the
new
haven
presented
the
commission
was
a
true
dilemma.
there
was
no
reliable
forecast
of
earnings
for
the
railroad.
as
judge
friendly
stated
in
his
first
opinion
“a
fair
price
for
new
haven
on
the
usual
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings
were
thus
be
negative
or
at
least
zero.
however,
much
evidence
was
presented
by
the
trustees
in
penn
central
on
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.”
the
commission
turned
to
that
evidence
as
indeed
showing
the
maximum
value
of
this
railroad.
now,
we
agree
of
course
with
counsel
for
the
bondholders
that
there’s
no
dispute
before
this
court
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
liquidation
value
tests.
the
essential
question
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
those
deductions
are
a
part
of
the
{voice
overlap}.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
evaluation
date
is
december
31,
1966.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
these
various
deductions
that
you
referred
to
your
honor
do
enter
into
the
valuation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
valuation
was
tied
down
to
december
31,
1966.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
assumption
was
--
the
postulation
was
that
it
would
take
six
years
to
know
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
see
no
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
see
no
inconsistency
the
--
i
will
come
to
what
the
theory
of
the
bulk
sale.
the
--
very
briefly,
the
bulk
sale
involves
a
quantification
of
risk
that
the
appraisals
testified
to
by
witnesses
presented
by
the
trustees
did
not
take
into
account.
it's
a
quantification
of
the
overall
risk
of
a
liquidation
that
it
would
not
occur
strictly
within
a
six-year
period
that
the
effect
of
new
havens
abandonment
on
the
value
of
real
estate
in
southern
new
england
should
also
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
got
both
of
them
here
because
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
there
is
no
inconsistency,
the
phrase
bulk
sale
is
a
name
of
the
commission
assigned
to
the
quantification
of
these
risks
that
had
an
earlier
been
taken
into
account.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
frankly,
your
honor
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
meaning
of
determine
commerce
generally.
i
know
what
the
meaning
was
that
the
commission
was
assigned
to
the
term
here.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
well,
that
in
fact
occurred.
there
was
a
sale
in
bulk
and
the
removal
of
these
additional
risks
from
the
new
haven
when
the
sale
actually
in
fact
occurred
but
that
was
not
an
essential
ingredient
to
quantifying
that
risks
that
we’re
talking
about.
the
commission
assigned
the
name,
the
bulk
sale
discount
to
a
quantification
of
risks
that
had
not
earlier
been
taken
into
account
and
these
risks,
the
commission
found
must
realistically
be
taken
into
account
in
order
to
determine
the
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.
but
again
we
come
back
to
the
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.
penn
central's
witness
simon
listed
several
different
risks.
his
primary
reference
was
to
the
inability
to
forecast
that
sales
would
be
made
strictly
with
on
schedule.
there
was
an
additional
very
large
risk
on
this
record.
the
earlier
appraisals
had
not
taken
into
account,
the
drastic
effect
that
in
abandonment
of
rail
service
in
new
england
would
have
on
the
real
estate
market
in
new
england.
and
the
trustee's
appraiser
himself
testified
that
if
this
effect
would
actually
be
felt
in
the
economy
of
southern
new
england,
his
appraisals
had
been
overstated
and
the
commission
did
not
address
itself
to
quantifying
any
of
these
unpriced
risks
until
the
remand
report.
the
reason
for
that
i
will
come
to.
the
initial
hearings
on
the
terms
for
the
new
haven's
inclusion
were
held
in
1967
while
the
courts
review
the
legality
the
penn-central
merger.
now
the
focus
on
these
1967
hearings
was
on
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
trustees
and
penn
central
under
which
the
new
haven
properties
and
freight
operations
would
be
transferred
to
penn
central
in
return
for
stock,
bonds,
and
cash,
and
penn
central's
assumption
of
certain
liabilities.
the
commission
tested
this
agreed
terms
first
by
considering
the
value
of
the
properties.
in
the
absence
of
perspective
earnings
the
commission's
valuation
proceeded
as
i've
stated
on
the
basis
of
a
liquidation
of
the
new
haven.
in
the
sense,
as
judge
friendly
noted,
the
liquidation
hypothesis
created
in
never,
never
land
but
the
need
to
postulate,
a
liquidation
of
a
huge
railroad
serving
a
large
geographic
area
of
heavy
population
also
required
the
commission
to
devote
it
skills
and
judgment
to
a
great
many
complex
problems.
now
just
one
example,
the
witnesses
for
the
trustees
presented
too
widely
varying
overall
appraisals
of
the
new
haven
properties
on
a
liquidation
basis.
one
appraisal
was
assumed
a
six-year
period
of
liquidation.
another
appraisal,
assumed
a
10-year
period
of
liquidation.
under
the
10-year
hypothesis,
it
would
cost
the
estate
$17
million
more
in
liquidation
expenses
to
realize
the
same
proceeds
as
under
a
six-year
hypothesis.
and
in
addition,
there
will
be
a
longer
wait
for
these
proceeds
and
hence
the
present
worth
of
the
proceeds
would
be
less.
penn
central
also
presented
the
10-year
liquidation
study.
each
study
reached
the
net
liquidation
value
for
new
haven
of
$59.00
less
then
the
trustees’
10-year
study
and
the
10-year
liquidation
period
consequently
would
be
under
either
appraisal
under
this
the
trustees’
appraisal
or
penn
centrals
would
be
many
millions
of
dollars
more
costly
to
the
estate
than
a
six-year
period.
one
further
element
here,
the
trustees’
appraisers
tend
to
support
a
10-year
period.
they
uniformly
testified
that
the
six-year
period
was
optimistic
and
on
the
low-end
of
a
reasonable
range
of
years
for
such
a
major
undertaking
but
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
bulk
of
the
liquidation
could
be
completed
within
the
period
of
six
years
the
commission
conservatively
adopted
the
six-year
liquidation
period.
and
consequently
the
much
higher
liquidation
value
than
under
any
of
the
10
year
studies.
and
another
factor,
all
of
the
appraisals
assumed
that
the
estate
could
market
the
properties
immediately
and
did
not
consider
the
need
for
an
abandonment
certificate
on
the
valuation
date.
the
commission
recognized
the
need
for
the
certificate
but
did
not
reach
its
value
in
the
inclusion
report.
moreover,
none
of
the
appraisals
price
out
the
overall
risks
of
making
this
schedule
of
sales
exactly
on
time
for
this
simply
assumed
normal
marketing
conditions
the
trustee.
that's
the
commission's
first
evaluation
in
the
inclusion
report
omitted
major
risk
factors
but
in
the
context
of
that
report
the
omission
made
no
difference.
the
commission
reach
the
value
of
the
consideration
penn
central
had
agreed
to
pay
for
the
new
haven
properties
and
if
found
that
that
consideration
would
be
at
least
equivalent
to
the
liquidation
value
base
on
the
appraisals
without
the
other
risk
factors
taken
into
account.
when
the
inclusion
report
was
remanded
however
by
both
courts,
a
new
context
was
presented.
for
now
the
commission
was
making
a
wholly
new
determination
of
price
and
not
merely
finding
a
value
that
penn
central
had
agreed
to
pay.
on
the
remand,
the
commission
increased
the
consideration
after
revaluing
the
properties.
bondholder's
essential
argument
before
this
court
is
that
the
commission
did
not
increase
that
valuation
and
pricing
off.
but
on
remand
the
commission
recognize
it
would
not
be
a
realistic
to
assume
a
liquidation
could
occur
without
an
abandonment
certificate
issued
under
sections
1
(18)
and
1
(19)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
if
new
haven
were
to
go
into
liquidation,
the
public
would
first
have
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
shippers
that
use
new
haven
would
have
to
be
heard
from.
government
agencies
will
certainly
present
plans
for
possible
continuation
of
essential
services.
what
is
more
than
new
haven
bondholders
themselves
had
urged
this
latest
1968
that
new
haven
could
be
operated
profitably
as
a
freight
only
railroad,
given
these
positions
of
all
the
potential
interests
in
the
new
haven
abandonment.
the
commission
could
not
have
assumed
in
the
remand
report
that
in
abandonment
proceeding
would
be
perfunctory
or
pro
forma.
the
shipper
and
governmental
interests
would
have
ensured
a
bitterly
thought
contest.
the
commission's
finding
that
such
a
proceeding
will
take
at
least
a
year
including
judicial
stays
was
clearly
reasonable
and
indeed
conservative
and
we
submit
in
the
proper
exercise
this
judgment.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
none.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
if
there
had
in
fact
been
liquidation,
it
is
quite
possible
as
the
commission
recognize
that
the
abandonment
proceeding
would
have
lasted
more
than
year.
the
commission
said
that
if
the
government
parties
requested
time
to
prepare
studies,
the
abandonment
proceeding
might
last
two
years
as
your
honor
suggested
it
might
go
on
more
than
that
but
that
is
not
essential
here.
regardless
of
how
long
it
would
in
fact
occur
the
commission's
--
the
commission
postulated
about
one
year
and
the
commission
charge
the
state
for
about
one
year.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
some
other
solution
however
your
honor
could
have
involved
liquidation
or
at
least
a
portion
of
the
new
haven.
the
bondholders
as
i
suggested
have
in
the
past
urged
that
the
new
haven
could
have
been
reorganized
as
a
freight
only
railroad
that
might
have
allowed
for
the
abandonment
of
some
unneeded
facilities.
but
this
all
would
it
have
to
be
explored
in
the
context
of
the
abandonment
proceeding
that
was
never
held.
if
it
had
been
held,
it
could
well
have
taken
more
one
than
one
year
which
we
strongly
urge
supports
the
conservativeness
of
the
commission's
estimate
that
it
would
take
only
one
year.
in
any
event,
the
state
under
the
liquidation
hypothesis
could
not
have
abandoned
and
liquidated
without
have
given
the
public
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
there
is
no
mixture
of
the
real
hypothetical
liquidation
hypothesis
on
prophecies
is
quite
hypothetical.
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
when
the
liquidation
would
actually
begin.
the
valuation
is
as
of
december
31,
1966
and
the
effect
of
deducting
from
that
a
one
year
delay
is
as
judge
friendly
stated
to
assume
that
the
liquidation
could
occur
january
1,
1968
but
that
is
only
the
effect
of
what
the
commission
has
done.
there's
no
finding
here
that
the
liquidation
would
in
fact
have
occurred
january
1,
1968.
the
commission
is
merely
saying
that
we
cannot
reach
a
liquidation
value
of
this
state
without
considering
the
fact
that
it
would
have
taken
the
state
one
year
to
obtain
the
certificate,
the
permission
in
hand
to
liquidate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
arraignment
a
bit
differently.
i
understand
their
argument
to
mean
that
the
commissioner
is
bar
as
a
matter
of
law
from
considering
the
need
of
this
state
for
an
abandonment
certificate
before
it
can
liquidate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that’s
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
that
is
also
your
honor,
a
portion
of
their
argument
that
is
the
necessary
portion
of
their
argument
that
new
haven
have
an
absolute
right
on
december
31,
1966
to
shut
down
and
liquidate
the
railroad.
we
say
that
this
was
not
permissible
assumption
that
the
railroad
could
merely
shut
down
without
giving
the
public
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
that
a
necessary
part
of
the
liquidation
value
is
this
cost
of
the
abandonment
certificate.
if
there's
no
statement,
must
have
in
hand
before
it
can
begin
the
liquidation.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
thank
you
very
much.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
bondholder
attack
on
the
cause
of
the
abandonment
proceeding
is
in
effect
the
demand
that
penn
central
pay
a
larger
share
of
the
pre-inclusion
losses.
the
commission
treated
that
claim
as
a
matter
separate
from
the
evaluation
and
did
in
fact
cause
penn
central
both
to
lend
$14
million
to
new
haven
in
the
year
1968
and
to
pay
$48
million
of
new
haven’s
losses.
after
december
31,
1968,
all
the
losses
for
penn
central
from
the
new
haven
operation
and
in
fairness
we
submit
penn
central
was
not
required
to
do
more.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
part,
the
erosion
occurred
by
the
issuance
of
trustees’
certificates
which
took
priority
in
the
claims.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
they
weren't.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
there
were
some
sales
of
--
no,
there
was
no
--
in
so
far
as
this
record
goes
in
inflated
figure,
there
is
no
erosion
in
the
liquidation
value
anywhere
near
comparable
to
$60
million
or
$70
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
only
reason
i
raise
the
issue
of
trustees’
certificates
is
that
some
of
these
were
issued
to
penn
central,
for
example
to
cover
the
$14
million
and
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
this
would
also
be
something
prior
to
their
lien
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
bondholders
are
attempting
again
to
mix
real
world
concepts
with
this
hypothetical
liquidation
and
what
they
are
being
paid
is
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
and
the
accumulation
of
these
losses
has
not
affected
that
value
anywhere
near
to
the
extent
of
the
$60
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
black
it
would
be
in
terms
of
the
accumulation
of
the
administration
claims.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
i
didn't
understand
your
question
then.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
may
--
i
may
not
have
understood
your
question.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
what
is
the
--?
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
could
easily
be
a
$100
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
quite
easily
and
the
free
use
argument
itself
amounts
to
$70
million
and
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
of
course
penn
central
would
be
required
to
pay
these
additional
sums.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
to
the
new
haven
estate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
to
the
new
haven
estate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
of
course,
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
fix
by
the
commission.
the
purchase
price
fixed
by
commission
was
on
the
order
on
$150
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
about
$150
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
those
are
the
bondholders.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
bondholders
of
new
haven,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
of
course
our
position
there
is
that
if
the
commission
is
aired
it
requires
a
remand
to
the
commission.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
bulk
sale
discount.
relying
on
the
testimony
presented
by
penn
central
in
the
remand
hearings.
the
commission
found
in
its
remand
report
that
the
unpriced
risk
of
a
liquidation
should
be
valued
at
$6.7
million
and
it
therefore
deducted
this
amount
in
the
computation
of
the
liquidation
value.
now
the
bondholders
primarily
argue
here
before
this
court
that
the
commission
had
no
rational
whatsoever
for
the
bulk
sale
discount
but
merely
sought
to
compel
it,
not
it's
true
that
the
report
refers
to
the
commission's
power
to
compel
the
acceptance
of
some
bulk
discount
to
attract
a
purchaser
for
continued
operation
of
the
railroad
but
this
was
not
essential
to
its
decision.
the
essential
basis
of
its
opinion
was
that
bulk
sale
discount
is
a
reflection
of
risks
that
have
not
already
been
accounted
for
in
the
earlier
appraisals
and
were
for
the
first
time
quantified
in
the
remand
hearings
but
the
commission
stated
this
quite
plainly.
the
commission
said
and
i
quote
“the
bondholders
will
receive
the
full
economic
equivalent
of
the
liquidation
value
of
the
assets.
the
discount
merely
reflects
a
market
appraisal
of
the
risks
that
the
state
avoids.”
and
then
two
pages
later,
the
commission
added
that
it
wouldn't
adopt
the
penn
central
deduction
to
“correspond
to
the
risks
of
a
six-year
liquidation
of
the
new
haven.”
now
judge
anderson
recognized
that
the
essential
basis
of
the
commission's
findings
was
not
compulsion.
he
addressed
himself
to
whether
the
deduction
reflected
risks
of
marketing.
but
in
so
doing,
he
substitutes
his
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
as
to
whether
the
appraisals
had
accounted
for
all
the
risks.
mr.
cox
will
describe
the
simon
testimony
in
greater
detail.
i
simply
want
to
submit
that
the
reorganization
court
in
our
view
went
beyond
bounds
in
substituting
its
own
economic
judgment
for
those
the
commission
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
a
part
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
judge
anderson
seemed
to
believe
that
an
earlier
deduction
made
by
one
of
the
trustee's
appraisers
had
accounted
for
all
of
the
risks
taken
into
account
in
this
bulk
sale
deduction.
that
is
a
matter
of
interpretation
as
to
what
that
witness
was
talking
about,
that
as
witness
maysen
presented
by
the
trustees.
we
showed
on
brief
i
believe
that
that
witness
was
not
speaking
of
the
risks
that
witness
simon
was
talking
about.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
judge
anderson
on
this
particular
item
would
find
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
difference
between
judge
anderson
and
the
commission
is
approximately
$30
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
but
there
are
several
legal
questions
because
judge
anderson
would
have
prohibited
the
commission
from
taking
it
into
account
either
the
cause
of
abandonment
certificate
or
the
cause
of
these
--
of
the
unpriced
risks
which
the
commission
called
the
bulk
sale
discount.
mr.
judge
anderson's
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
commission
was
precluded
from
taking
into
account
these
factors.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
it
is
a
substitution
of
judgment,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
coming
to
that
just
now.
over
half
the
consideration
paid
by
penn
central
with
the
new
haven
properties
wasn't
in
a
form
of
956,576
shares
of
penn
central
common
stock,
and
one
of
the
major
questions
litigated
before
the
commission
was
the
value
of
the
stock.
the
trustees’
bargain,
to
obtain
this
stock
so
as
to
participate
in
future
increases
in
stock
value
as
the
merger
savings
were
realized.
this
in
turn
would
permit
the
widest
participation
in
the
reorganization
by
the
new
haven
creditors.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
agreement
initially
was
negotiated
by
the
trustees
without
the
participation
of
the
creditors
but
now
they
apparently
agreed,
the
creditors
agreed
that
stock
is
acceptable
to
them
and
they
are
before
this
court
asking
you
that
for
more
stock
or
for
interest
on
common
stock.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
as
of
december
31,
1966,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
they
can.
they
will
come
to
that.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
the
under
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they're
not
entitled
to
the
$145
million
in
cash
in
hand.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
because
they're
participating
in
the
reorganization
which
provides
for
the
creation
of
an
investment
company
that
is
to
stay
in
business
for
seven
years
and
the
part
of
the
assets
of
this
investment
company
is
the
950,000
shares
which
the
state
wants
to
keep
in
hand
in
order
to
participate
in
the
increase
--
expected
increase
in
that
stock.
this
is
part
in
partial
of
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
present
value
what
they
have
in
hand
will
be
a
$145
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
value
on
the
critical
date
is
140
plus
the
$5
million
of
participation
in
losses
and
they
will
realize
that
$145
million
at
the
conclusion
of
a
10-year
period.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
value
of
the
--
the
value
of
consideration
that
they
have
received
is
the
$145
million
that
is
the
present
value.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
but
they
have
in
hand
also
an
underwriting
requirement,
an
obligation
of
penn
central
to
ensure
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
is
why
i
have
place
before
the
court
two
charts
in
which
i
attempt
to
show
that
the
claim
that
the
bondholders
have
before
this
court
for
additional
sums
over
and
above
the
stock
has
been
fully
offset
by
penn
central’s
underwriting
obligation.
if
the
court
will
bare
with
me
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer
your
honor
because
of
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
might
well
increase
the
costs.
for
example
the
penn
central
bonds
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
will
depend
on
the
form
of
the
consideration
as
quite
likely
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
would
have
a
very
direct
effect
if
the
capital
costs
of
the
business
are
increased.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
indeterminate,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
potentially,
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
potentially,
that
is
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
it's
very
difficult
of
value
some
of
this
claims
being
made
by
the
bondholders,
we
think
that
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
(voice
overlap)
of
$100
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
possible.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
the
form
of
the
consideration
that
penn
central
has
required
to
issue
increases
its
capital
costs
then
it
could
possibly
have
some
effect
on
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
could
possibly
have
and
in
fact
on
the
public
and
on
the
rates
to
be
charged
if
the
price
that
is
increased
--
increases
in
turn
the
capital
cost
of
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
quite
likely.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
presumably
it
comes
out
of
penn
central's
pocket
and
into
the
pockets
of
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
doesn't
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
does
not
occur
to
me
how
it
could
be
avoided.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
said
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
avoided.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
it's
quite
possible.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
just
one
moment
to
the
chart
that
i
placed
before
it
concerning
the
price
of
the
penn
central
stock.
the
bondholders
concede
that
the
underwriting
obligation
protects
them
on
the
upside.
in
other
words,
with
this
first
chart
labeled
bondholder
assumption
a,
where
they
claim
that
the
stock
should
be
assigned
a
market
value
on
the
closing
date
of
december
31,
1968.
they
can
see
that
the
underwriting
protects
them
between
63
and
3/8
and
87-1/2.
they
then
discount
that
the
person's
worth
and
on
the
per
share
basis
they
claim
that
this
protection
is
only
worth
$40.
they
then
would
say
we
are
entitled
to
$10
as
the
difference.
in
this
process
however,
they
ignored
the
downside
protection
which
is
also
accorded
by
the
underwriting
obligation.
in
this
instance,
the
downside
protection
protects
them
from
a
drop
in
the
price
from
63
down
to
the
current
market
value
of
25
and
below
and
has
a
value
of
at
least
$22.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
is
your
honor
the
time
of
the
closing
data
in
december
31,
1968
when
these
bondholders
accepted
the
950,000
shares
at
63
and
3/8.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they
accept
it.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
and
they
accepted
a
status
as
an
equity
holder
in
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
and
penn
central
therefore
discharged
this
obligation
to
the
estate
to
the
extent
of
the
$63.00.
what
they
were
entitled
to
was
something
in
addition
to
the
$63.00
in
order
to
bring
it
up
to
$87.50.
but
the
underwriting
obligation
doesn’t
work
entirely
that
way,
it
only
protects
them
on
the
upside.
it
will
also
protects
them
on
the
downside.
if
the
stock
goes
below
63,
they're
still
protected
by
this
underwriting
obligation.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
not
only
up
to
$87.50
but
down
below
$63.00.
if
the
stock
drops
below
63
even
though
that
amount
has
been
discharged
under
the
underwriting
obligation
at
penn
central
must
make
this
up
in
1978.
therefore,
this
downside
protection
below
63
has
a
substantial
present
value.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
just
one
further
comment
about
scope
of
the
judicial
review
that
should
apply
in
these
proceedings
that
will
complete
it.
the
closing
remarks
of
mr.
seymour
rule
out
--
suggest
to
me
that
he's
asking
the
court
to
rely
on
the
long
experience
of
judge
anderson
with
the
new
haven
estate.
their
position
on
the
scope
of
review
also
seems
to
bear
on
their
position
that
no
remand
will
be
needed
even
if
the
commission
has
erred
in
its
valuation
of
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards.
however,
section
77
(e)
states
on
its
face
that
the
commission
shall
determine
the
value.
and
valuation
is
not
listed
among
the
determinations
to
be
made
by
the
court.
the
valuation
is
placed
by
the
statute
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ecker
case
adopted
the
present
argument
of
the
trustees
and
it
held
that
the
district
court
was
required
to
exercise
its
own
independent
judgment
on
questions
of
value.
this
court
reversed.
this
court
held
that
the
district
court’s
degree
of
participation
in
the
reorganization
did
not
include
valuation
and
that
section
77
(e)
left
the
determination
of
value
to
the
commission
without
the
necessity
of
a
reexamination
by
the
court
when
that
determination
is
reached
between
material
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
in
accordance
with
legal
standards.
but
to
be
sure
the
reorganization
court
may
receive
new
evidence
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
the
group
of
investors
case
beside
the
same
day
as
ecker,
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
receive
additional
evidence
may
aid
it
in
determining
whether
changed
circumstances
require
that
the
plan
referred
--
to
be
referred
back
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
the
third
item
that
i
distributed
to
the
court
is
an
extract
from
hearings
on
a
bill
that
was
introduced
just
after
the
ecker
and
group
of
investors
cases.
that
bill
was
introduced
in
the
congress
which
would
--
and
would
have
overturned
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ecker.
the
text
of
the
bill
is
set
forth
in
that
extract
as
well
as
a
statement
of
proof
by
the
entire
commission
in
opposition
to
the
bill.
the
bill
was
never
reported
and
it
died
in
committee.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
involved
the
fairness
of
a
reorganization
plan
for
the
new
haven
railroad
and
at
the
same
time
the
fairness
of
the
terms
where
the
inclusion
of
that
railroad
into
the
newly
merged
penn
central
railroad.
three
organization
plan
was
made
possible
because
of
the
happenchance
that
during
the
course
of
the
new
haven
bankruptcy,
penn
and
new
york
central
applied
for
permission
to
merge.
in
this
merger,
the
new
haven
trustees
saw
both
a
threat
and
an
opportunity
as
their
counsel
stated
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1967.
inclusion
in
penn
central,
in
the
view
of
the
trustees
afforded
the
only
practicable
means
for
reorganization
of
the
debtor
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
best
interest
of
the
public
and
of
all
parties
interested
in
the
debtor's
estate.
they
quickly
filed
for
inclusion
in
1962
within
three
months
after
penn
and
central
asked
permission
to
merge.
under
decision
of
this
court
the
commission
had
no
power
to
force
the
inclusion.
at
all
stages,
the
inclusion
depended
on
the
volition
of
the
owners
of
the
new
haven
for
five
years
until
1967.
no
bondholder
objected
to
the
course
being
pursued
by
the
trustees
and
at
that
time
the
reorganization
court
rejected
the
sole
objection
presented
by
the
committee
since
that
objection
failed
to
receive
the
support
of
either
manufacturers
or
chase.
now
this
is
been
a
long
and
difficult
assignment
for
the
commission.
in
no
reorganization
has
the
process
of
valuation
been
more
meticulous
or
more
carefully
supervised
by
the
courts.
the
oral
hearings
in
1967
extended
over
37
days
in
over
a
period
of
five
months
during
the
period
of
five
months.
further
hearings
were
held
before
a
special
master
of
the
reorganization
court
and
then
more
hearings
before
the
commission
on
remand
of
the
inclusion
report.
the
entire
commission
considered
and
reconsidered
this
extensive
record
in
three
reports
dealing
with
the
valuation.
the
bondholders’
initial
approach
before
the
commission
was
to
value
the
new
haven
as
a
freight
only
railroad.
this
was
not
merely
in
response
to
evidence
presented
by
penn
central
but
rather
they
apply
to
the
reorganization
court
for
order
number
324
in
july
of
1965
for
funds
to
complete
such
a
study
and
at
the
pre-hearing
conference
in
1966,
they
announced
that
“studies
are
being
made
with
a
view
to
evaluating
the
railroad
as
a
freight
only
operation”
and
the
study
was
in
fact
presented
in
the
hearings
in
1967.
it
may
--
it
might
have
been
possible
to
reorganize
a
portion
of
the
railroad
to
provide
freight
service.
it
was
not
explored
in
any
depth
by
the
commission
since
the
study
presented
by
the
bondholders
did
not
project
freight
only
earnings
beyond
the
year
1965.
the
valuation
of
the
new
haven
presented
the
commission
was
a
true
dilemma.
there
was
no
reliable
forecast
of
earnings
for
the
railroad.
as
judge
friendly
stated
in
his
first
opinion
“a
fair
price
for
new
haven
on
the
usual
basis
of
capitalization
of
earnings
were
thus
be
negative
or
at
least
zero.
however,
much
evidence
was
presented
by
the
trustees
in
penn
central
on
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.”
the
commission
turned
to
that
evidence
as
indeed
showing
the
maximum
value
of
this
railroad.
now,
we
agree
of
course
with
counsel
for
the
bondholders
that
there’s
no
dispute
before
this
court
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
liquidation
value
tests.
the
essential
question
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
those
deductions
are
a
part
of
the
{voice
overlap}.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
evaluation
date
is
december
31,
1966.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
these
various
deductions
that
you
referred
to
your
honor
do
enter
into
the
valuation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
valuation
was
tied
down
to
december
31,
1966.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
assumption
was
--
the
postulation
was
that
it
would
take
six
years
to
know
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
see
no
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
see
no
inconsistency
the
--
i
will
come
to
what
the
theory
of
the
bulk
sale.
the
--
very
briefly,
the
bulk
sale
involves
a
quantification
of
risk
that
the
appraisals
testified
to
by
witnesses
presented
by
the
trustees
did
not
take
into
account.
it's
a
quantification
of
the
overall
risk
of
a
liquidation
that
it
would
not
occur
strictly
within
a
six-year
period
that
the
effect
of
new
havens
abandonment
on
the
value
of
real
estate
in
southern
new
england
should
also
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
got
both
of
them
here
because
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
there
is
no
inconsistency,
the
phrase
bulk
sale
is
a
name
of
the
commission
assigned
to
the
quantification
of
these
risks
that
had
an
earlier
been
taken
into
account.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
frankly,
your
honor
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
meaning
of
determine
commerce
generally.
i
know
what
the
meaning
was
that
the
commission
was
assigned
to
the
term
here.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
well,
that
in
fact
occurred.
there
was
a
sale
in
bulk
and
the
removal
of
these
additional
risks
from
the
new
haven
when
the
sale
actually
in
fact
occurred
but
that
was
not
an
essential
ingredient
to
quantifying
that
risks
that
we’re
talking
about.
the
commission
assigned
the
name,
the
bulk
sale
discount
to
a
quantification
of
risks
that
had
not
earlier
been
taken
into
account
and
these
risks,
the
commission
found
must
realistically
be
taken
into
account
in
order
to
determine
the
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.
but
again
we
come
back
to
the
liquidation
value
of
the
railroad.
penn
central's
witness
simon
listed
several
different
risks.
his
primary
reference
was
to
the
inability
to
forecast
that
sales
would
be
made
strictly
with
on
schedule.
there
was
an
additional
very
large
risk
on
this
record.
the
earlier
appraisals
had
not
taken
into
account,
the
drastic
effect
that
in
abandonment
of
rail
service
in
new
england
would
have
on
the
real
estate
market
in
new
england.
and
the
trustee's
appraiser
himself
testified
that
if
this
effect
would
actually
be
felt
in
the
economy
of
southern
new
england,
his
appraisals
had
been
overstated
and
the
commission
did
not
address
itself
to
quantifying
any
of
these
unpriced
risks
until
the
remand
report.
the
reason
for
that
i
will
come
to.
the
initial
hearings
on
the
terms
for
the
new
haven's
inclusion
were
held
in
1967
while
the
courts
review
the
legality
the
penn-central
merger.
now
the
focus
on
these
1967
hearings
was
on
an
agreement
entered
into
between
the
trustees
and
penn
central
under
which
the
new
haven
properties
and
freight
operations
would
be
transferred
to
penn
central
in
return
for
stock,
bonds,
and
cash,
and
penn
central's
assumption
of
certain
liabilities.
the
commission
tested
this
agreed
terms
first
by
considering
the
value
of
the
properties.
in
the
absence
of
perspective
earnings
the
commission's
valuation
proceeded
as
i've
stated
on
the
basis
of
a
liquidation
of
the
new
haven.
in
the
sense,
as
judge
friendly
noted,
the
liquidation
hypothesis
created
in
never,
never
land
but
the
need
to
postulate,
a
liquidation
of
a
huge
railroad
serving
a
large
geographic
area
of
heavy
population
also
required
the
commission
to
devote
it
skills
and
judgment
to
a
great
many
complex
problems.
now
just
one
example,
the
witnesses
for
the
trustees
presented
too
widely
varying
overall
appraisals
of
the
new
haven
properties
on
a
liquidation
basis.
one
appraisal
was
assumed
a
six-year
period
of
liquidation.
another
appraisal,
assumed
a
10-year
period
of
liquidation.
under
the
10-year
hypothesis,
it
would
cost
the
estate
$17
million
more
in
liquidation
expenses
to
realize
the
same
proceeds
as
under
a
six-year
hypothesis.
and
in
addition,
there
will
be
a
longer
wait
for
these
proceeds
and
hence
the
present
worth
of
the
proceeds
would
be
less.
penn
central
also
presented
the
10-year
liquidation
study.
each
study
reached
the
net
liquidation
value
for
new
haven
of
$59.00
less
then
the
trustees’
10-year
study
and
the
10-year
liquidation
period
consequently
would
be
under
either
appraisal
under
this
the
trustees’
appraisal
or
penn
centrals
would
be
many
millions
of
dollars
more
costly
to
the
estate
than
a
six-year
period.
one
further
element
here,
the
trustees’
appraisers
tend
to
support
a
10-year
period.
they
uniformly
testified
that
the
six-year
period
was
optimistic
and
on
the
low-end
of
a
reasonable
range
of
years
for
such
a
major
undertaking
but
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
the
bulk
of
the
liquidation
could
be
completed
within
the
period
of
six
years
the
commission
conservatively
adopted
the
six-year
liquidation
period.
and
consequently
the
much
higher
liquidation
value
than
under
any
of
the
10
year
studies.
and
another
factor,
all
of
the
appraisals
assumed
that
the
estate
could
market
the
properties
immediately
and
did
not
consider
the
need
for
an
abandonment
certificate
on
the
valuation
date.
the
commission
recognized
the
need
for
the
certificate
but
did
not
reach
its
value
in
the
inclusion
report.
moreover,
none
of
the
appraisals
price
out
the
overall
risks
of
making
this
schedule
of
sales
exactly
on
time
for
this
simply
assumed
normal
marketing
conditions
the
trustee.
that's
the
commission's
first
evaluation
in
the
inclusion
report
omitted
major
risk
factors
but
in
the
context
of
that
report
the
omission
made
no
difference.
the
commission
reach
the
value
of
the
consideration
penn
central
had
agreed
to
pay
for
the
new
haven
properties
and
if
found
that
that
consideration
would
be
at
least
equivalent
to
the
liquidation
value
base
on
the
appraisals
without
the
other
risk
factors
taken
into
account.
when
the
inclusion
report
was
remanded
however
by
both
courts,
a
new
context
was
presented.
for
now
the
commission
was
making
a
wholly
new
determination
of
price
and
not
merely
finding
a
value
that
penn
central
had
agreed
to
pay.
on
the
remand,
the
commission
increased
the
consideration
after
revaluing
the
properties.
bondholder's
essential
argument
before
this
court
is
that
the
commission
did
not
increase
that
valuation
and
pricing
off.
but
on
remand
the
commission
recognize
it
would
not
be
a
realistic
to
assume
a
liquidation
could
occur
without
an
abandonment
certificate
issued
under
sections
1
(18)
and
1
(19)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
if
new
haven
were
to
go
into
liquidation,
the
public
would
first
have
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
shippers
that
use
new
haven
would
have
to
be
heard
from.
government
agencies
will
certainly
present
plans
for
possible
continuation
of
essential
services.
what
is
more
than
new
haven
bondholders
themselves
had
urged
this
latest
1968
that
new
haven
could
be
operated
profitably
as
a
freight
only
railroad,
given
these
positions
of
all
the
potential
interests
in
the
new
haven
abandonment.
the
commission
could
not
have
assumed
in
the
remand
report
that
in
abandonment
proceeding
would
be
perfunctory
or
pro
forma.
the
shipper
and
governmental
interests
would
have
ensured
a
bitterly
thought
contest.
the
commission's
finding
that
such
a
proceeding
will
take
at
least
a
year
including
judicial
stays
was
clearly
reasonable
and
indeed
conservative
and
we
submit
in
the
proper
exercise
this
judgment.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
none.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
if
there
had
in
fact
been
liquidation,
it
is
quite
possible
as
the
commission
recognize
that
the
abandonment
proceeding
would
have
lasted
more
than
year.
the
commission
said
that
if
the
government
parties
requested
time
to
prepare
studies,
the
abandonment
proceeding
might
last
two
years
as
your
honor
suggested
it
might
go
on
more
than
that
but
that
is
not
essential
here.
regardless
of
how
long
it
would
in
fact
occur
the
commission's
--
the
commission
postulated
about
one
year
and
the
commission
charge
the
state
for
about
one
year.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
some
other
solution
however
your
honor
could
have
involved
liquidation
or
at
least
a
portion
of
the
new
haven.
the
bondholders
as
i
suggested
have
in
the
past
urged
that
the
new
haven
could
have
been
reorganized
as
a
freight
only
railroad
that
might
have
allowed
for
the
abandonment
of
some
unneeded
facilities.
but
this
all
would
it
have
to
be
explored
in
the
context
of
the
abandonment
proceeding
that
was
never
held.
if
it
had
been
held,
it
could
well
have
taken
more
one
than
one
year
which
we
strongly
urge
supports
the
conservativeness
of
the
commission's
estimate
that
it
would
take
only
one
year.
in
any
event,
the
state
under
the
liquidation
hypothesis
could
not
have
abandoned
and
liquidated
without
have
given
the
public
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
there
is
no
mixture
of
the
real
hypothetical
liquidation
hypothesis
on
prophecies
is
quite
hypothetical.
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
when
the
liquidation
would
actually
begin.
the
valuation
is
as
of
december
31,
1966
and
the
effect
of
deducting
from
that
a
one
year
delay
is
as
judge
friendly
stated
to
assume
that
the
liquidation
could
occur
january
1,
1968
but
that
is
only
the
effect
of
what
the
commission
has
done.
there's
no
finding
here
that
the
liquidation
would
in
fact
have
occurred
january
1,
1968.
the
commission
is
merely
saying
that
we
cannot
reach
a
liquidation
value
of
this
state
without
considering
the
fact
that
it
would
have
taken
the
state
one
year
to
obtain
the
certificate,
the
permission
in
hand
to
liquidate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
arraignment
a
bit
differently.
i
understand
their
argument
to
mean
that
the
commissioner
is
bar
as
a
matter
of
law
from
considering
the
need
of
this
state
for
an
abandonment
certificate
before
it
can
liquidate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that’s
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
that
is
also
your
honor,
a
portion
of
their
argument
that
is
the
necessary
portion
of
their
argument
that
new
haven
have
an
absolute
right
on
december
31,
1966
to
shut
down
and
liquidate
the
railroad.
we
say
that
this
was
not
permissible
assumption
that
the
railroad
could
merely
shut
down
without
giving
the
public
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
that
a
necessary
part
of
the
liquidation
value
is
this
cost
of
the
abandonment
certificate.
if
there's
no
statement,
must
have
in
hand
before
it
can
begin
the
liquidation.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
thank
you
very
much.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
bondholder
attack
on
the
cause
of
the
abandonment
proceeding
is
in
effect
the
demand
that
penn
central
pay
a
larger
share
of
the
pre-inclusion
losses.
the
commission
treated
that
claim
as
a
matter
separate
from
the
evaluation
and
did
in
fact
cause
penn
central
both
to
lend
$14
million
to
new
haven
in
the
year
1968
and
to
pay
$48
million
of
new
haven’s
losses.
after
december
31,
1968,
all
the
losses
for
penn
central
from
the
new
haven
operation
and
in
fairness
we
submit
penn
central
was
not
required
to
do
more.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
part,
the
erosion
occurred
by
the
issuance
of
trustees’
certificates
which
took
priority
in
the
claims.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
they
weren't.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
there
were
some
sales
of
--
no,
there
was
no
--
in
so
far
as
this
record
goes
in
inflated
figure,
there
is
no
erosion
in
the
liquidation
value
anywhere
near
comparable
to
$60
million
or
$70
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
only
reason
i
raise
the
issue
of
trustees’
certificates
is
that
some
of
these
were
issued
to
penn
central,
for
example
to
cover
the
$14
million
and
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
this
would
also
be
something
prior
to
their
lien
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
bondholders
are
attempting
again
to
mix
real
world
concepts
with
this
hypothetical
liquidation
and
what
they
are
being
paid
is
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
liquidation
of
the
new
haven
and
the
accumulation
of
these
losses
has
not
affected
that
value
anywhere
near
to
the
extent
of
the
$60
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
black
it
would
be
in
terms
of
the
accumulation
of
the
administration
claims.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
i
didn't
understand
your
question
then.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
may
--
i
may
not
have
understood
your
question.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
what
is
the
--?
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
could
easily
be
a
$100
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
quite
easily
and
the
free
use
argument
itself
amounts
to
$70
million
and
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
of
course
penn
central
would
be
required
to
pay
these
additional
sums.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
to
the
new
haven
estate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
to
the
new
haven
estate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
of
course,
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
fix
by
the
commission.
the
purchase
price
fixed
by
commission
was
on
the
order
on
$150
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
about
$150
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
those
are
the
bondholders.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
bondholders
of
new
haven,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
of
course
our
position
there
is
that
if
the
commission
is
aired
it
requires
a
remand
to
the
commission.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
bulk
sale
discount.
relying
on
the
testimony
presented
by
penn
central
in
the
remand
hearings.
the
commission
found
in
its
remand
report
that
the
unpriced
risk
of
a
liquidation
should
be
valued
at
$6.7
million
and
it
therefore
deducted
this
amount
in
the
computation
of
the
liquidation
value.
now
the
bondholders
primarily
argue
here
before
this
court
that
the
commission
had
no
rational
whatsoever
for
the
bulk
sale
discount
but
merely
sought
to
compel
it,
not
it's
true
that
the
report
refers
to
the
commission's
power
to
compel
the
acceptance
of
some
bulk
discount
to
attract
a
purchaser
for
continued
operation
of
the
railroad
but
this
was
not
essential
to
its
decision.
the
essential
basis
of
its
opinion
was
that
bulk
sale
discount
is
a
reflection
of
risks
that
have
not
already
been
accounted
for
in
the
earlier
appraisals
and
were
for
the
first
time
quantified
in
the
remand
hearings
but
the
commission
stated
this
quite
plainly.
the
commission
said
and
i
quote
“the
bondholders
will
receive
the
full
economic
equivalent
of
the
liquidation
value
of
the
assets.
the
discount
merely
reflects
a
market
appraisal
of
the
risks
that
the
state
avoids.”
and
then
two
pages
later,
the
commission
added
that
it
wouldn't
adopt
the
penn
central
deduction
to
“correspond
to
the
risks
of
a
six-year
liquidation
of
the
new
haven.”
now
judge
anderson
recognized
that
the
essential
basis
of
the
commission's
findings
was
not
compulsion.
he
addressed
himself
to
whether
the
deduction
reflected
risks
of
marketing.
but
in
so
doing,
he
substitutes
his
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
as
to
whether
the
appraisals
had
accounted
for
all
the
risks.
mr.
cox
will
describe
the
simon
testimony
in
greater
detail.
i
simply
want
to
submit
that
the
reorganization
court
in
our
view
went
beyond
bounds
in
substituting
its
own
economic
judgment
for
those
the
commission
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
a
part
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
judge
anderson
seemed
to
believe
that
an
earlier
deduction
made
by
one
of
the
trustee's
appraisers
had
accounted
for
all
of
the
risks
taken
into
account
in
this
bulk
sale
deduction.
that
is
a
matter
of
interpretation
as
to
what
that
witness
was
talking
about,
that
as
witness
maysen
presented
by
the
trustees.
we
showed
on
brief
i
believe
that
that
witness
was
not
speaking
of
the
risks
that
witness
simon
was
talking
about.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
judge
anderson
on
this
particular
item
would
find
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
difference
between
judge
anderson
and
the
commission
is
approximately
$30
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
but
there
are
several
legal
questions
because
judge
anderson
would
have
prohibited
the
commission
from
taking
it
into
account
either
the
cause
of
abandonment
certificate
or
the
cause
of
these
--
of
the
unpriced
risks
which
the
commission
called
the
bulk
sale
discount.
mr.
judge
anderson's
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
commission
was
precluded
from
taking
into
account
these
factors.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
it
is
a
substitution
of
judgment,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
coming
to
that
just
now.
over
half
the
consideration
paid
by
penn
central
with
the
new
haven
properties
wasn't
in
a
form
of
956,576
shares
of
penn
central
common
stock,
and
one
of
the
major
questions
litigated
before
the
commission
was
the
value
of
the
stock.
the
trustees’
bargain,
to
obtain
this
stock
so
as
to
participate
in
future
increases
in
stock
value
as
the
merger
savings
were
realized.
this
in
turn
would
permit
the
widest
participation
in
the
reorganization
by
the
new
haven
creditors.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
agreement
initially
was
negotiated
by
the
trustees
without
the
participation
of
the
creditors
but
now
they
apparently
agreed,
the
creditors
agreed
that
stock
is
acceptable
to
them
and
they
are
before
this
court
asking
you
that
for
more
stock
or
for
interest
on
common
stock.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
as
of
december
31,
1966,
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
they
can.
they
will
come
to
that.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
the
under
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they're
not
entitled
to
the
$145
million
in
cash
in
hand.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
because
they're
participating
in
the
reorganization
which
provides
for
the
creation
of
an
investment
company
that
is
to
stay
in
business
for
seven
years
and
the
part
of
the
assets
of
this
investment
company
is
the
950,000
shares
which
the
state
wants
to
keep
in
hand
in
order
to
participate
in
the
increase
--
expected
increase
in
that
stock.
this
is
part
in
partial
of
the
reorganization
plan.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
present
value
what
they
have
in
hand
will
be
a
$145
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
value
on
the
critical
date
is
140
plus
the
$5
million
of
participation
in
losses
and
they
will
realize
that
$145
million
at
the
conclusion
of
a
10-year
period.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
value
of
the
--
the
value
of
consideration
that
they
have
received
is
the
$145
million
that
is
the
present
value.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
but
they
have
in
hand
also
an
underwriting
requirement,
an
obligation
of
penn
central
to
ensure
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
is
why
i
have
place
before
the
court
two
charts
in
which
i
attempt
to
show
that
the
claim
that
the
bondholders
have
before
this
court
for
additional
sums
over
and
above
the
stock
has
been
fully
offset
by
penn
central’s
underwriting
obligation.
if
the
court
will
bare
with
me
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer
your
honor
because
of
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
might
well
increase
the
costs.
for
example
the
penn
central
bonds
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
will
depend
on
the
form
of
the
consideration
as
quite
likely
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
would
have
a
very
direct
effect
if
the
capital
costs
of
the
business
are
increased.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
indeterminate,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
potentially,
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
potentially,
that
is
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
it's
very
difficult
of
value
some
of
this
claims
being
made
by
the
bondholders,
we
think
that
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
(voice
overlap)
of
$100
million.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
possible.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
the
form
of
the
consideration
that
penn
central
has
required
to
issue
increases
its
capital
costs
then
it
could
possibly
have
some
effect
on
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
could
possibly
have
and
in
fact
on
the
public
and
on
the
rates
to
be
charged
if
the
price
that
is
increased
--
increases
in
turn
the
capital
cost
of
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
quite
likely.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
presumably
it
comes
out
of
penn
central's
pocket
and
into
the
pockets
of
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
doesn't
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
does
not
occur
to
me
how
it
could
be
avoided.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
said
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
avoided.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
think
it's
quite
possible.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
should
like
to
refer
the
court
just
one
moment
to
the
chart
that
i
placed
before
it
concerning
the
price
of
the
penn
central
stock.
the
bondholders
concede
that
the
underwriting
obligation
protects
them
on
the
upside.
in
other
words,
with
this
first
chart
labeled
bondholder
assumption
a,
where
they
claim
that
the
stock
should
be
assigned
a
market
value
on
the
closing
date
of
december
31,
1968.
they
can
see
that
the
underwriting
protects
them
between
63
and
3/8
and
87-1/2.
they
then
discount
that
the
person's
worth
and
on
the
per
share
basis
they
claim
that
this
protection
is
only
worth
$40.
they
then
would
say
we
are
entitled
to
$10
as
the
difference.
in
this
process
however,
they
ignored
the
downside
protection
which
is
also
accorded
by
the
underwriting
obligation.
in
this
instance,
the
downside
protection
protects
them
from
a
drop
in
the
price
from
63
down
to
the
current
market
value
of
25
and
below
and
has
a
value
of
at
least
$22.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
is
your
honor
the
time
of
the
closing
data
in
december
31,
1968
when
these
bondholders
accepted
the
950,000
shares
at
63
and
3/8.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they
accept
it.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
and
they
accepted
a
status
as
an
equity
holder
in
penn
central.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
and
penn
central
therefore
discharged
this
obligation
to
the
estate
to
the
extent
of
the
$63.00.
what
they
were
entitled
to
was
something
in
addition
to
the
$63.00
in
order
to
bring
it
up
to
$87.50.
but
the
underwriting
obligation
doesn’t
work
entirely
that
way,
it
only
protects
them
on
the
upside.
it
will
also
protects
them
on
the
downside.
if
the
stock
goes
below
63,
they're
still
protected
by
this
underwriting
obligation.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
not
only
up
to
$87.50
but
down
below
$63.00.
if
the
stock
drops
below
63
even
though
that
amount
has
been
discharged
under
the
underwriting
obligation
at
penn
central
must
make
this
up
in
1978.
therefore,
this
downside
protection
below
63
has
a
substantial
present
value.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
just
one
further
comment
about
scope
of
the
judicial
review
that
should
apply
in
these
proceedings
that
will
complete
it.
the
closing
remarks
of
mr.
seymour
rule
out
--
suggest
to
me
that
he's
asking
the
court
to
rely
on
the
long
experience
of
judge
anderson
with
the
new
haven
estate.
their
position
on
the
scope
of
review
also
seems
to
bear
on
their
position
that
no
remand
will
be
needed
even
if
the
commission
has
erred
in
its
valuation
of
the
harlem
river
and
oak
point
yards.
however,
section
77
(e)
states
on
its
face
that
the
commission
shall
determine
the
value.
and
valuation
is
not
listed
among
the
determinations
to
be
made
by
the
court.
the
valuation
is
placed
by
the
statute
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ecker
case
adopted
the
present
argument
of
the
trustees
and
it
held
that
the
district
court
was
required
to
exercise
its
own
independent
judgment
on
questions
of
value.
this
court
reversed.
this
court
held
that
the
district
court’s
degree
of
participation
in
the
reorganization
did
not
include
valuation
and
that
section
77
(e)
left
the
determination
of
value
to
the
commission
without
the
necessity
of
a
reexamination
by
the
court
when
that
determination
is
reached
between
material
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
in
accordance
with
legal
standards.
but
to
be
sure
the
reorganization
court
may
receive
new
evidence
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
stated
in
the
group
of
investors
case
beside
the
same
day
as
ecker,
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
receive
additional
evidence
may
aid
it
in
determining
whether
changed
circumstances
require
that
the
plan
referred
--
to
be
referred
back
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
the
third
item
that
i
distributed
to
the
court
is
an
extract
from
hearings
on
a
bill
that
was
introduced
just
after
the
ecker
and
group
of
investors
cases.
that
bill
was
introduced
in
the
congress
which
would
--
and
would
have
overturned
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ecker.
the
text
of
the
bill
is
set
forth
in
that
extract
as
well
as
a
statement
of
proof
by
the
entire
commission
in
opposition
to
the
bill.
the
bill
was
never
reported
and
it
died
in
committee.
thank
you.
