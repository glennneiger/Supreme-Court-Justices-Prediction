mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trustee
of
the
new
haven
railroad
is
here
as
an
appellee
respondent,
arguing
on
the
side
on
the
appellants
because
he
feels
very
strongly
that
in
the
four
areas
in
which
the
reorganization
court
differed
with
the
commission,
the
court
should
be
sustained.
i
would
address
myself
to
the
question
which
the
government
and
penn
central
says
is
probably
the
most
important
question
and
yet
a
simple
question
namely
scope
of
review.
the
government
says
the
three-judge
court
was
right,
judge
anderson
was
wrong
on
these
four
points
because
the
judge
anderson
did
not
review
the
commission
from
the
standpoint
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule
whereas
the
three-judge
court
did.
we
don't
agree
with
the
government
because
while
we
are
satisfied
that
the
three-judge
court
was
bound
the
substantial
evidence
rule,
we
do
not
think
that
judge
anderson
as
the
reorganization
court
was.
the
issue
is
simple
in
one
respect.
both
sides
cite
ecker
versus
western
pacific
as
the
basis
for
their
position.
there's
no
question
that
ecker
address
to
self
squarely
to
the
division
of
functions
under
the
section
77
of
the
commission
and
the
reorganization
court.
there
is
no
question
that
ecker
establishes
that
valuation
of
any
property
and
we
don't
qualify
that
is
the
function
of
the
commission.
the
question
is
however,
what
is
the
function
of
the
reorganization
court
in
reviewing
that
valuation?
is
it
truly
bound
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule?
our
position
here
is
that
ecker
doesn't
say
that.
ecker
says
the
contrary,
we
think
further
more
it
should
be
not
bound
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule
because
of
the
unique
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
the
reasons
why
the
function
of
the
reorganization
court
spelled
out
in
detailed
that
is
in
section
77
(e).
now
let
me
address
myself
just
very
briefly
at
each
of
these
points.
in
ecker,
the
court
said
that
while
the
judges
not
to
review
valuation
as
such
the
judge
is
to
determine
with
such
additional
evidence
as
he
deems
appropriate
this
is
not
a
quote
but
this
is
my
reading
of
ecker.
the
said
judicial
evidences
he
deems
appropriate
whether
the
commission
in
fact
did
obey
the
statutory
standards.
now
why
would
this
be
so?
now,
this
comes,
i
think
fairly
from
the
fact
that
the
statute
section
77
is
wholly
unique.
under
section
77,
you
have
an
intertwining
of
administrative
law
and
judicial
review
such
as
you
can't
find
a
parallel
at
any
other
statute
to
my
knowledge.
in
the
first
place,
the
background
of
section
77
was
to
find
the
way
of
having
some
method
of
reorganizing
railroads
and
i'll
come
back
in
the
moment
to
the
year
it
was
1933
which
it
got
rid
of
equity
receiverships
a
as
function
which
took
away
from
the
parties
who
controlled
the
railroads,
the
control
of
the
reorganization.
at
the
same
time,
you
had
and
this
is
one
of
the
significant
background
pieces
of
reason
in
the
statute,
you
have
railroads
going
under
beginning
in
1933.
you
did
not
have
other
modes
of
transportation
that
were
fairly
competitive
that
they
should
--
may
have
today.
you
have
the
problem
of
a
national
interest
so
concern
with
saving
this
railroads
and
a
statute
which
forbid
straight
bankruptcy.
you
have
to
reorganize.
even
today,
you
can't
go
into
bankruptcy
with
a
railroad.
section
77
is
your
only
remedy
and
at
the
top
of
that
you
have
an
agency
with
a
whole
history
of
expertise
and
evaluation
since
1914.
it's
been
evaluating
railroad
under
section
19
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
think
every
railroad
in
the
county,
eventually
was
valued
as
required
of
that
statute.
with
that
background,
the
congress
fashion
a
statute
under
which
the
commission
will
determine
the
value
of
the
property
because
in
the
public
interests
that
would
determine
the
capitalization.
it
would
determine,
what
was
the
possibility
of
saving
the
railroad
of
making
it
solvent
in
the
future?
the
court
would
determine
and
this
is
the
essential
point
here
in
this
interpretation
that
with
independent
hearings
whether
this
plan
was
fair
and
equitable,
and
in
determining
whether
it
was
fair
and
equitable,
the
statute
clearly
contemplates
that
it
would
receive
additional
evidence.
i'm
not
referring
to
that
language
in
ecker
no,
77
(e)
itself
contemplates
and
said
so
that
if
the
court
rejects
the
plan,
it
must
send
it
back
to
the
commission
with
the
evidence
which
have
received.
77
(e)
also
points
out
that
persons
may
come
before
the
reorganization
court
and
this
is
without
regard
to
whether
it
was
before
the
commission
and
introduce
their
claims
for
equitable
treatment.
this
brings
us
really
to
mr.
justice
douglas
language
in
the
st.
joe
case.
he
said
there,
the
reorganization
court
function
is
distinguished
from
the
commission
function
and
that
the
commission
is
the
chief
architect
under
section
77
(e)
and
then
i
think
it’s
about
this
shorthand
fair
in
expression
is
one
could
imagine
because
that’s
precisely
what
happens
if
nobody
puts
in
the
plan,
the
commission
divide
it's
own
plan.
while
the
safeguards
in
77
(e)
and
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned
but
certainly
we
could
not
have
the
commission
both
devising
its
plan
and
being
the
reviewing
court
of
its
own
plan.
now
i
think
the
legislative
history
and
i
have
a
very
little
more
time
that
i
can
devote
to
this
subject.
i
think
the
legislative
history
which
is
recited
in
full
in
ecker
shows,
that
at
one
point
congress
in
the
house,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
decided
that
the
whole
power
should
be
vested
in
the
commission
and
not
in
the
court
but
the
senate
wouldn't
accept
that
and
we
find
written
into
77
(e)
the
power
of
review
including
independent
hearings
on
the
part
of
the
reorganization
court.
in
closing
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
bring
the
attention
of
the
court
that
there
is
no
dilemma
here
between
three-judge
court
and
reorganization
court
under
this
interpretation
of
the
law,
there
just
isn't
any.
the
three-judge
court
was
clearly
bound
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule
and
made
its
findings
however
right
or
not
with
that
rule
in
mind.
judge
anderson
recognized
that
he
was
subject
to
ecker.
he
did
not
make
his
findings
contrary
to
ecker.
he
made
his
findings
based
on
the
section
called
methods
of
valuation
which
appear
in
ecker.
the
question
whether
these
two
principle
discounts
for
example
were
proper
deductions
from
the
liquidation
value.
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
it's
fair
to
say
here
that
there
is
every
reason
to
recognize
a
different
rule
of
review
under
77,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
to
hearken
back
to
1933
for
a
moment
that
this
is
an
extremely
important
question.
it
was
in
the
last
eight
and
a-half
years,
not
only
has
the
new
haven
petitioned
in
7,
but
we've
had
two
more
eastern
railroads
the
center
of
new
jersey
and
now
with
boston
and
maine
and
the
question
of
the
impact
and
the
railroad
of
impact
of
section
5
and
77
is
not
one
which
can
be
put
on
the
shelf
as
being
pass
off
just
in
this
case.

you.
