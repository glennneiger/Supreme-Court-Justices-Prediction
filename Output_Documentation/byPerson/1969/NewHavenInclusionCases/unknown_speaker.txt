unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
were
three
classes
of
bonds?
am
i
mistaken?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
disagreement
between
you
and
mr.
seymour?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
migdal.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
prepare
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it,
about
a
mile
or
so
or
less?
unknown
speaker
has
the
value
per
share
--
i
mean
the
price
market,
price
per
share
would
have
ever
gone,
ever
have
been
as
high
as
87.50
during
this
period?
unknown
speaker
now
if
you're
right
in
your
position
that
you
ought
to
have
security
and
all
the
rest,
shouldn't
the
other
side
of
the
coin
be
that
you
should
be
obligated
to
return
any
excess
so
that
you
finally
dispose
of
these
shares
at
above
87.50
a
share
or
do
you
want
the
best
of
both
worlds?
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes
that's
something
else
but
--
unknown
speaker
has
a
meaning
or
significance
only
if
you
tight
it
down
to
a
date
or
dates?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
not
that
it
could
be
all
liquidated
within
that
24
hour
period?
unknown
speaker
what?
with
six
years?
unknown
speaker
now,
six
years
and
then
you
take
a
deduction
because
you
say
we'll
take
another
year
to
get
permission
to
abandon?
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
if
you
add
it
all
up,
it
could
be
a
$100
million
or
more?
unknown
speaker
if
you
count
$70
million
for
the
grand
central
properties
and
then
another
$29
million
plus
or
minus,
all
over
a
$100
million?
it
could,
couldn't
it?
accumulating
all
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
purchase
price?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
penn
central
agreed
to
underwrite
losses
--
certain
percentage
of
losses,
100%
the
first
year,
declining
scale?
unknown
speaker
well
they
agreed
to
it,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
now
the
commission
lets
them
out
from
under
that?
unknown
speaker
or
part
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
can
get
into
big
argument
about
that.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
best
thing
in
the
bidding
is
just
give
this
road
to
penn
central
for
nothing?
unknown
speaker
in
this
opinion,
that
we’re
reviewing
of
the
reorganization
court
it
did
some
embroidery
work
upon
the
original
underwriting
agreement,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
upon
the
provision
it
created?
i
beg
your
pardon?
unknown
speaker
if
we
should
approve
his
ruling
on
the
reorganization
court's
ruling
on
the
phase
of
the
case,
it
would
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
again,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
