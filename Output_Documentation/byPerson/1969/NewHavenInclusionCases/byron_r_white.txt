even

that

who

the

justice

white
well,
the
creditors
are
going
to
get
on
that
basis
too
or
just
a
cash
payment?
justice
byron

white
would
you
agree
that
the
creditors
--
the
bondholders
were
kind
of
to
pull
liquidation
value
of
new

justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
entire
or
the
half
of
$145
million
on
that
net?
justice
byron

white
or
they
certainly
can't
get
it
out
to

then?
justice
byron

white
well
it
can't
on
that

there
isn't
any
possible
way
they
can
get

on

on

even
with
even
within
a

justice
byron

white
why
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron

white
so
you'd
say
that,
there's
value,
it
should
be
paid
to
liquidate
the
value
of
security
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
value
on
the
critical
date
isn't
the
145?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
value
on
this
is
--
will
be
$145
million
within
the
next
10
years
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn’t
get
it
out
today.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
obligation
does't
secure
within
the
--
except
up
to
1978?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
of
the
losses
in
fact
are
prior
to
the
bondholder's
interest,
aren't
they?
would
all
those
operating
losses
be
administrative
expenses
entitled
to
prior

over
the

justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
$60

justice
byron

white
when
did
the
bondholders
first
voice
any
objection
to
inclusion
or
did
they
ever?m
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
should
liquidate?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
they
participate
in
the
inclusion
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
mr.
cox
they
get
some
--
they
abandon
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
is
it
true
that
the
6%
that
was
originally
set
as
a
discount,
was
that
intended
to
reflect
just
the
value,
the
translation
of
the
future
value
to
present
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
didn't
reflect
any
uncertainties
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
economy
or
in
real
estate
values
or
in
not
being
able
to
sell
as
soon
as
you
thought
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
it's
implicit
in
your
argument
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
appraisals
they
were
relying
on
the
expert
testimony
was
the
value
of
the
real
estate
as
of
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
1966.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
of
the
appraisals
purported
to
be
made
in
the
light
of
the
liquidation
plan
that
is
we
predict
that
this
value
would
be
worth
this
so
much
in
six
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
purport
to
include
the
factors
that
the
commission
has
now
included.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
then
purported
to
set
at
value
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
were
sold
december
1966?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
if
you
have
had
experts
who
actually
testified
what
the
property
would
be
worth
if
sold
pursuant
to
this
liquidation
plan
over
a
period
of
six
years,
you
might
have
some
problems
with
the
icc
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
--
i'm
looking
at
a
map
on
page
511-c
of
the
appendix.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that,
if
i
got
the
right
map
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
then
it's
got
blue
line
going
down
across
the
hell
gate
bridge?
justice
byron

white
and
it's
got
one
going
out
the
bronx
river.
justice
byron

white
and
goes
along
a
thing
kind
of
a
--
well,
i
would
know
what
color
to
call
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
one
going
starting
out
the
bronx
river,
a
short
line.
perhaps
that's
a
lot
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that,
mr.
cox?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
the
moneylender
gives
that
an
inherent
value
about
stocks.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
to
keep
it,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
we
know
this
part
and
parcel
of
the
plan
that's
what
they
have
been
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
either
you
just
wanted
their
money
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
who
wasn't
going
to
use
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
there
are
stocks
from
making
this
claim,
is
that
the
basis
in
what
this
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
or
whatever
you're
holding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
they
could
satisfy
liquidation
--
the
liquidating
value
standard
by
giving
them
money
today
which
will
be
worth
a
$145
million
10
years
from
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
you're
saying
with
the
stock
within
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
going
to
give
this
some
pieces
of
paper
that
within
10
years
it
will
be
worth
$83
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
supposing
they
don't
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
aren't
rejecting
payment.
would
you
think
they
would
take
if
you
gave
the
$83
million
in
cash,
that
they
would
it
up
rather
than
she
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
what
their
claim
want
to
be
here
is
really
is
it
not
they
want
more
stock
but
they
really
ought
to
say
that
they
want
bonds
which
bears
a
rate
of
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i
suppose
they
suggest
this
is
the
only
way
that
they
can
speak.
nobody
could
have
raised
the
money
to
penn.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
blame
that
on
anyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
another
matter
we're
talking
about
is
giving
somebody
liquidation
value
and
give
inherent
value?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reorganization
court
modified
the
underwriting
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
in
this
--
its
opinion
is
here
for
review.
they
entered
some
supplementary
provisions,
didn’t
they
doubt
reorganization
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
knew
and
i
take
it
it's
something
that
it
will
cost
$283
million
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
wouldn't
be
any
impairment
on
the
--
i
mean
the
same
rate
base
would
exists?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
asset
value
would
go
on
about
balance
sheet
for
which
we
issue
the
share
in
any
event.
justice
byron
r.

but
how
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you're
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
willing
to
accept
stock
at
all?
justice
byron

why?
can
it
require
you?
justice
byron

white
on

justice

you
could
never
