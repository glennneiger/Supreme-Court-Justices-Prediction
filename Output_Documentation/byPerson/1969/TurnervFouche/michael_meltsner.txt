mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
a
statutory
three-judge
court
convened
in
the
southern
district
of
georgia.
it
was
drawn
in
1967
by
negro
appellants
as
a
class
action
challenged
violations
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
by
georgia
statutes
and
state
constitutional
provisions
which
set
out
an
interlocking
system
of
jury
and
school
board
selection
and
also
to
enjoin
racial
discrimination
in
the
enforcement
of
these
statutes
by
appellee
officials
in
taliaferro
county,
georgia.
appellants
make
three
claims
in
this
court.
that
the
georgia
statute
which
authorizes
jury
commissioners
to
exclude
persons
from
service
they
deem
not
intelligent
and
upright
is
void
for
one
of
the
standards.
secondly
that
the
district
court
failed
to
grant
adequate
relief
to
reform
racial
selection
of
jurors
and
school
board
members,
and
third
that
a
restriction
that
school
board
members
be
freeholders
or
real
property
owners
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
georgia
system
for
jury
and
school
board
selection
which
is
at
the
center
of
this
case
begins
when
a
superior
court
judge
is
elected
by
the
voters
of
multi-county
circuits.
in
this
case,
taliaferro
county
is
one
of
six
counties
which
vote
to
elect
the
superior
court
judge
for
the
tombs
circuit.
the
judge
then
selects
six
citizens
of
each
county
who
serve
as
jury
commissioners.
these
commissioners
in
turn
select
jurors
from
the
official
registered
voter
list
by
disqualifying
persons
from
the
list,
who
they
do
not
believe
are
intelligent
and
upright
and
also
by
disqualifying
persons
who
are
not
the
right
age
and
haven’t
resided
in
the
county
for
the
right
period
of
time
and
for
other
similar
reasons.
they
then
reduced
the
number
remaining
randomly
in
order
to
get
a
workable
number
and
place
that
number
on
a
traverse
jury
list.
from
the
traverse
list,
they
select
not
more
than
two-fifths
to
constitute
the
grand
jury
list.
and
from
this
list,
the
superior
court
judge
selects
names
which
ultimately
constitute
the
county
grand
jury.
this
grand
jury
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
he
chooses
32
names
from
the
grand
jury
list,
calls
the
persons
into
court,
hears
excuses
and
then
takes
the
first
23
names
remaining
on
the
list.
mr.
michael
meltsner
from
not
more
than
two-fifths,
a
number
of
about
a
130
in
this
county.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
he
picks
them
from
a
box
randomly.
gets
32
names,
the
sheriff
goes
out,
calls
those
32
into
court.
the
judge
then
hears
excuses.
mr.
michael
meltsner
and
then
takes
the
first
23
names
to
constitute
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
grand
jury
among
its
functions
elects
the
five-man
county
school
board
when
vacancy
has
occurred
from
the
freeholders
of
the
county
and
the
school
board
is
responsible
for
the
management
and
operation
of
the
schools
in
the
county.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it’s
about
six
months
i
believe,
the
term
of
court
each
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
five
years.
mr.
michael
meltsner
whenever
there
has
to
be
a
vacancy,
now
if
there
is
a
death
or
resignation,
the
school
board
will
pick
and
interim
candidate
but
the
next
grand
jury
will
then
act
and
is
free
to
select
whoever
it
wants
for
the
position.
if
there
is
a
vacancy
due
to
be
end
of
the
term,
the
grand
jury
preceding
that
vacancy
will
make
the
decision.
now
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
litigation
in
1967,
no
negro
had
ever
been
selected
to
serve
as
a
jury
commissioner
by
the
circuit
--
by
the
superior
court
judge.
and
while
black
people
are
60%
of
the
population
in
this
county
and
50%
of
the
voters,
only
a
small
number
of
their
number
were
on
the
jury
lists.
no
county
grand
jury
had
ever
selected
a
black
school
board
member,
although
since
1965
the
schools
were
totally
black.
whites
having
fled
rather
than
attend
desegregated
schools
to
a
horribly
setup
private
school
in
the
county
or
to
adjoining
counties.
indeed,
until
the
district
court
acted
in
an
earlier
case
involving
several
of
the
parties
in
1965
by
setting
up
a
receivership
over
the
public
schools
of
the
county,
public
funds
were
used
to
transport
the
whites
out
of
county
to
other
schools.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
record
only
shows
the
race
of
the
judge
now
in
office
as
white.
i
think
it
was
assumed
by
all
the
parties
and
the
district
court
that
there
never
had
been
one
at
least
in
the
preceding
80
years.
after
taking
evidence,
the
district
court
informed
the
jury
commissioners
and
school
board
members
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
and
that
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
school
board
could
not
continue.
the
court
ordered
the
defendants
to
make
an
attempt
to
remedy
the
situation
and
suggested
that
two
blacks
to
be
put
on
the
school
board
prior
to
a
reconvening
of
the
court
a
month
later.
the
jury
commissioners
during
this
period
recompiled
the
jury
list
placing
additional
negroes
on
it
and
a
new
grand
jury
was
selected.
however,
the
commissioners
excluded
a
171
negroes
and
only
seven
whites
because
they
failed
to
meet
the
statutory
requirement
that
jurors
be
intelligent
and
upright.
the
new
grand
jury
made
two
appointments
to
the
school
board.
one
was
a
white
man
and
one
was
a
black
man.
the
black
man
chosen
had
a
third
grade
education,
no
children
in
the
school
and
he
was
selected
without
the
public
notice
which
is
required
by
georgia
law.
on
the
basis
of
the
recomposition
of
the
jury
list,
the
addition
of
one
negro
to
the
school
board
and
its
view
as
to
the
constitutional
questions
presented,
the
district
court
merely
enjoined
future
racial
exclusion
in
selection
of
the
grand
jury
and
denied
further
relief.
appellants
first
contention
in
this
court
is
that
section
59-106
of
the
georgia
code
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
authorizing
jury
commissioners
to
exclude
men
who
they
believe
are
not
upright
and
intelligent.
now
certainly
these
terms
with
the
synonyms
used
by
georgia
officials
to
characterize
there
meaning,
the
word
like
understanding
or
honesty
are
words
which
have
no
commonly
accepted
meaning.
they
are
matters
of
personal
judgment
unless
they
are
tied
to
some
objective
standard
as
they
are
not
in
georgia.
there
are
several
consequences
to
their
use
which
supports
the
appellant’s
contention.
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
select
eligible
jury.
the
first
is
that
they
make
the
right
to
participate
in
the
institution
of
government
depend
on
the
will,
whim,
or
caprice
of
a
public
official.
the
court
has
condemned
placing
such
discretion
in
the
hands
of
voting
registrars
as
jury
commissioners
exercise
a
similar
function.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
different
rule
should
apply.
secondly,
because
men
cannot
agree
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
terms
to
their
application
to
particular
individuals,
they
always
command
arbitrary,
erratic
and
inconsistent
judgments
between
individuals.
thus
at
the
outset,
the
use
of
these
terms
seems
to
me
are
basically
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
due
process
of
law
that
more
rather
than
men
will
govern
whether
or
not
one
can
exercise
a
right.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
21
plus
georgia
makes
22.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
the
22
states
listed
in
the
jurisdictional
statements,
seven
are
in
the
south.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
a
language
is
often
vague
and
undefined
and
certainly
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
vague
word.
but
its
function
is
totally
different
from
the
function
that
these
words
--
its
function
is
to
guide
the
court
in
its
decision
of
cases
and
it
is
construed
by
the
court
in
accordance
with
history
and
its
own
decisions.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
that
this,
this
always
is
--
always
going
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
the
administration
drew
law
but
in
appraising
the
constitutionality
of
it,
one
has
to
look
at
the
function
involved
and
the
necessity
of
the
particular
bid
of
discretion.
now
here,
there
is
absolutely
no
necessity.
congress
has
passed
a
perfectly
satisfactory
jury
selection
statute
which
does
away
with
the
capacity
for
arbitrariness
and
discrimination
which
this
form
of
statute
has.
secondly,
a
jury
deciding
a
negligence
case
for
example
is
not
selecting
among
individuals
in
the
community.
it
is
perhaps
exercising
an
ad
hoc
judgment
which
in
certain
circumstances
the
law
allows.
the
question
is
whether
the
results
that
this
record
show
and
the
capacity
which
this
court
has
already
condemned
in
many,
many
other
areas
are
necessary
and
i
submit
that
they’re
not
here
and
that
there
is
no
state
interest
involved
in
allowing
the
jury
commissioners
this
much
discretion
to
select
among
individuals
at
their
will.
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh!
yes.
i
think
the
error
in
the
statute
here
is
--
the
infirmity
in
the
statute
is
the
arbitrary
power
which
it
confers.
now
the
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
which
this
record
has
in
abundance,
the
--
for
example
exclusion
of
a
171
of
a
178
persons
of
the
negro
race
under
this
standard
is
evidence
of
this
capacity
for
abuse,
quite
strong
evidence.
but
our
quarrel
would
still
exist
with
the
statute
because
the
statute
--
the
problem
with
the
statute
is
that
it
makes
almost
impossible
selection
between
individuals
which
is
not
erratic
and
which
does
not
depend
on
the
will
of
the
selecting
official.
now
i
think
another
thing
that
one
might
consider
here
is
that
it’s
totally
impossible
to
review
and
appraise
and
evaluate
the
decision
made
by
these
jury
commissioners.
we
can
disagree
with
what
they
say
when
it’s
a
all
171
of
these
are
178
persons
black
that
can’t
be.
but
one
can’t
get
in
there
and
prove
it.
one
can
evaluate
it,
one
can’t
review
it
and
that
is
a
function
as
this
court
has
always
apparently
employed
vagueness
analysis
to
permit.
unless
there
is
some
specificity,
there’s
absolutely
no
way
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
being
used
in
fact
to
discriminate
because
it
obviously
has
its
opportunity
for
discrimination.
the
jury
commissioner
need
only
pretend
that
the
negro
is
of
poor
character
and
little
intelligence
to
mask
his
discrimination.
and
therefore
it’s
not
surprising
that
a
171
of
these
persons
are
black.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
don’t
say
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
that’s
this
case
i
would
say
this.
i
would
say
this
that
clearly
the
other
jurisdiction
which
have
these
statutes
might
by
administrative
action
or
by
judicial
construction
apply
to
the
jury
selection
procedure,
the
sort
of
standards
and
confining
of
discretion
which
would
make
them
non-arbitrary.
but
our
quarrel
is
with
the
statute
on
its
face.
i
do
--
this
one
more
point
i
think
would
be
stressed
here
and
that
is
that
even
the
well
intention
and
sincere
jury
commissioner
is
offered
precious
indictments
for
these
terms
other
than
a
vague
sense
that
he
should
select
the
best
people
around.
and
it’s
all
too
lightly
then
that
he
will
select
the
persons
were
most
like
himself
when
the
persons
who
would
like
those
he
encounters
in
social
gatherings
and
quite
unconsciously
it
simplifises
exclude
blacks
who
he
does
not
come
in
contact
with.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly
it
would.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
would
certainly
remove
from
him
the
capacity
to
disqualify
persons
on
the
basis
of
his
subjective
will,
his
subjective
understanding
of
these
illusive
concepts.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
as
this
statute
is
written,
this
is
clearly
a
disqualification
of
the
voters
who
are
at
the
beginning
deemed
eligible
and
that
is
in
fact
the
way
that’s
been
applied
in
this
particular
county,
the
--
what
the
jury
commissioners
do
is
they
take
the
voter
list,
they
sit
around
and
they
go
over
every
name
in
the
voter
list
and
they
say,
is
he
upright
and
intelligent,
and
they
cut
out
certain
number
of
persons
in
that
way.
if
their
authority
was
removed,
then
eligible
voters,
they
would
be
the
basic
source
still.
they
would
then
be
able
to
move
persons
who
were
in
insane
asylums
who
were
not
of
the
proper
age,
who
were
not
residing
the
county
so
what
they
would
then
have
the
source.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
there
are
two
--
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
your
question
is
that
if
this
language
was
declared
void,
there
would
still
be
some
general
free
raging
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
jury
commissioners
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
would
agree
that
they
would
still
have
the
capacity
to
discriminate
as
any
one
administrating
a
system
does.
but
the
basis
on
which
they
have
justified
this
particular
discrimination
on
which
jury
officials
constantly
do
so
would
be
removed.
as
i
read
the
statute
in
light
of
there
practice
that
they
would
have
to
take
any
persons
who
did
not
meet
--
who
were
voters
and
were
not
excluded
for
specific
reasons
and
in
effect,
that
is
what
we
ask
this
court
to
so
hold
that
this
is
too
subjective
arbitrary
and
erratic
a
way
of
selecting
jurors.
the
state
may
come
back
and
pick
another
system
which
is
more
specific.
it
may
not.
mr.
michael
meltsner
more
objective
than
this.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
now
there
is
one
more
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
the
401
would
find
consistent
results
of
that
sort
with
the
statute
of
this
kind.
they
would
have
to
have
been
brought
into
it.
some
form
of
objective
line
drawing
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
then
perhaps
the
--
as
a
litigant,
i
would
have
no
complaint
but
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
of
this
sort,
the
complaint
is
there
--
there
is
an
inherent
capacity
for
arbitrariness
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
position
is
that
in
this
case,
both
are
important,
both
are
here
and
that
the
court
should
decide
this
case.
but
i
must
take
the
position
that
the
vice
of
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
result.
the
result
merely
confirms
the
vice
which
we
see
in
it.
now,
the
infirmity
in
the
statute
is
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
infirmity
in
this
statute
is
in
its
grant
of
arbitrary
power.
just
as
in
the
licensing
field
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that
a
litigant
in
a
class
excluded
would
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
yes,
i
certainly
do.
and
for
that,
i
wish
to
come
back
to
the
state
of
georgia
because
there’s
another
aspect
to
this
jury
system
which
i
think
the
court
ought
to
consider.
and
that’s
not
only
as
jury
selection
involved
here,
but
the
grand
jury
has
been
given
a
political
function
and
so
the
operation
of
the
statute
is
to
exclude
blacks
from
selecting
public
officials.
it’s
not
just
the
jury
system
that’s
involved
here.
it’s
excluding
black
people
in
this
county
from
choosing
school
board.
and
so
as
important
as
in
participating
in
the
administration
of
justices,
we
have
even
more
important
rights
at
stake
here.
my
second
claim
that
--
the
second
claim
that
we
wish
to
present
to
the
court
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
adequately
reform
the
system
of
jury
and
school
board
selection.
certainly,
if
the
court
strikes
down
the
broad
discretion
which
georgia
law
grants
the
jury
commissioners
that
will
no
doubt
make
far
more
likely
non-racial
jury
and
school
board
selection.
but
there
is
still
need
for
equitable
relief
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
to
make
it
unlikely
to
recur
in
the
future.
initially,
the
present
school
boards
still
has
on
it,
person
selected
by
grand
juries
which
for
themselves
unconstitutionally
selective.
and
one
step,
we
think
that
the
district
court
should
be
required
to
take
on
remand
is
to
vacate
the
membership
board
in
order
to
--
and
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
make
a
great
with
the
past.
more
fundamentally
to
make
sure
that
discrimination
does
not
recur,
at
a
minimum,
the
district
court
should
appoint
black
jury
commissioners
as
was
sort
in
the
complaint.
the
commissioners
play
critical
role
in
this
process
in
a
small
amount
of
discrimination
in
the
future
with
tip
control
with
the
grand
jury
to
whites.
they
have
discriminated
in
the
past.
they
have
--
there
has
never
been
a
black
jury
commissioner
and
the
whole
process
works
over
an
issue
which
blacks
in
this
county
have
enormous
interest.
whites
on
the
other
hand
have
no
interest
comparable
in
educational
quality.
i
think
it’s
a
little
like
the
voter
registration
act
if
i
can
use
that
--
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
if
i
can
use
that
analogy
where
the
statute
provided
that
under
certain
circumstances,
the
courts
might
appoint
voting
registrars
to
administer
even
a
non-discretionary
system
of
voting
registration.
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
activities
of
the
appellee
officials
here
makes
similar
relief
at
a
minimum
necessary.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
upright
and
intelligent?
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
other
standard
aside
from
age
and
residence
is
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
residence.
is
that
idiots
and
lunatics
are
excluded.
mr.
michael
meltsner
idiots
and
lunatics
are
excluded.
that’s
the
only
other
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
upright
and
intelligent.
mr.
michael
meltsner
right.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
the
very
short
time
left,
i’m
going
to
try
and
deal
with
two
or
three
of
these
issues.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
assuming
that
the
court
eliminates
the
capacity
for
discrimination
in
the
upright
and
intelligence
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
strikes
that
down.
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
have
concluded
that
the
most
appropriate
remedy
is
for
the
district
court
to
try
and
make
this
system
of
selection
which
is
ingrained
in
state
law
work
and
we
think
the
way
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i’m
sorry.
we
have
concluded
that
if
this
statute
is
knocked
down
by
the
court,
our
challenge
is
successful
that
the
most
appropriate
way
for
the
district
court
to
assure
that
the
system
of
school
board
selection
and
jury
selection
works
is
to
appoint
black
jury
commissioners
to
put
them
in
this
process.
because
a
very
small
amounted
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
would
tip
the
balance
in
the
grand
jury
which
selects
the
school
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
not,
we
do
not
press
in
this
court
for
ancillary
damages
but
all
that
relief
may
be
appropriate
to
the
district
court
to
advice
a
system
which
will
assure
their
selection.
mr.
michael
meltsner
absolutely
not,
after
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment,
96%
of
the
persons
excluded
under
the
statutory
test
were
black.
declaratory
judgment
is
not
going
to
work.
now
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
question
as
to
the
freeholder
requirement,
this
is
just
something
i
wish
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
in
this
point
because
i
just
discovered
it
really
and
that
is
that
georgia
has
two
other
ways
of
selecting
school
boards.
one
is
a
--
local
law
may
be
passed
and
the
referendum
take
place
and
other
is
that
area
school
boards
may
be
created.
now
the
constitutional
provisions
which
provide
for
these
systems
of
selection
say
nothing
about
freeholders.
indeed,
they
delegate
to
the
voters
of
the
particular
communities,
the
power
to
set
qualifications.
thus,
there
can’t
be
very
much
of
a
state
interest
involved
here.
finally,
i
just
--
one
more
point
here.
mr.
justice
stewart,
these
statutes
with
the
exception
of
the
cross-section
to
the
community
language
are
all
reconstruction
statutes.
they
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
see.
finally,
i
just
wish
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
we
do
not
disagree
that
a
state
has
an
interest
in
the
intelligent
and
upright
jurors.
we
merely
assert
that
the
test
involved
in
the
statute
is
not
the
way
to
achieve
that
end.
it
grants
too
much
discretion
and
invites
racial
discrimination.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
some
of
them
definitely
will
but
i
think
in
most
of
them,
my
own
experience
is
that
in
most
of
them,
there
are
administrative
procedures
grafted
onto
them
which
make
the
selection
much
fairer
but
certainly
many
of
these
statutes
will
have
to
go.
mr.
michael
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
a
statutory
three-judge
court
convened
in
the
southern
district
of
georgia.
it
was
drawn
in
1967
by
negro
appellants
as
a
class
action
challenged
violations
of
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
by
georgia
statutes
and
state
constitutional
provisions
which
set
out
an
interlocking
system
of
jury
and
school
board
selection
and
also
to
enjoin
racial
discrimination
in
the
enforcement
of
these
statutes
by
appellee
officials
in
taliaferro
county,
georgia.
appellants
make
three
claims
in
this
court.
that
the
georgia
statute
which
authorizes
jury
commissioners
to
exclude
persons
from
service
they
deem
not
intelligent
and
upright
is
void
for
one
of
the
standards.
secondly
that
the
district
court
failed
to
grant
adequate
relief
to
reform
racial
selection
of
jurors
and
school
board
members,
and
third
that
a
restriction
that
school
board
members
be
freeholders
or
real
property
owners
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
georgia
system
for
jury
and
school
board
selection
which
is
at
the
center
of
this
case
begins
when
a
superior
court
judge
is
elected
by
the
voters
of
multi-county
circuits.
in
this
case,
taliaferro
county
is
one
of
six
counties
which
vote
to
elect
the
superior
court
judge
for
the
tombs
circuit.
the
judge
then
selects
six
citizens
of
each
county
who
serve
as
jury
commissioners.
these
commissioners
in
turn
select
jurors
from
the
official
registered
voter
list
by
disqualifying
persons
from
the
list,
who
they
do
not
believe
are
intelligent
and
upright
and
also
by
disqualifying
persons
who
are
not
the
right
age
and
haven’t
resided
in
the
county
for
the
right
period
of
time
and
for
other
similar
reasons.
they
then
reduced
the
number
remaining
randomly
in
order
to
get
a
workable
number
and
place
that
number
on
a
traverse
jury
list.
from
the
traverse
list,
they
select
not
more
than
two-fifths
to
constitute
the
grand
jury
list.
and
from
this
list,
the
superior
court
judge
selects
names
which
ultimately
constitute
the
county
grand
jury.
this
grand
jury
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
that’s
correct.
he
chooses
32
names
from
the
grand
jury
list,
calls
the
persons
into
court,
hears
excuses
and
then
takes
the
first
23
names
remaining
on
the
list.
mr.
michael
meltsner
from
not
more
than
two-fifths,
a
number
of
about
a
130
in
this
county.
mr.
michael
meltsner
no,
he
picks
them
from
a
box
randomly.
gets
32
names,
the
sheriff
goes
out,
calls
those
32
into
court.
the
judge
then
hears
excuses.
mr.
michael
meltsner
and
then
takes
the
first
23
names
to
constitute
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
grand
jury
among
its
functions
elects
the
five-man
county
school
board
when
vacancy
has
occurred
from
the
freeholders
of
the
county
and
the
school
board
is
responsible
for
the
management
and
operation
of
the
schools
in
the
county.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it’s
about
six
months
i
believe,
the
term
of
court
each
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
meltsner
five
years.
mr.
michael
meltsner
whenever
there
has
to
be
a
vacancy,
now
if
there
is
a
death
or
resignation,
the
school
board
will
pick
and
interim
candidate
but
the
next
grand
jury
will
then
act
and
is
free
to
select
whoever
it
wants
for
the
position.
if
there
is
a
vacancy
due
to
be
end
of
the
term,
the
grand
jury
preceding
that
vacancy
will
make
the
decision.
now
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
litigation
in
1967,
no
negro
had
ever
been
selected
to
serve
as
a
jury
commissioner
by
the
circuit
--
by
the
superior
court
judge.
and
while
black
people
are
60%
of
the
population
in
this
county
and
50%
of
the
voters,
only
a
small
number
of
their
number
were
on
the
jury
lists.
no
county
grand
jury
had
ever
selected
a
black
school
board
member,
although
since
1965
the
schools
were
totally
black.
whites
having
fled
rather
than
attend
desegregated
schools
to
a
horribly
setup
private
school
in
the
county
or
to
adjoining
counties.
indeed,
until
the
district
court
acted
in
an
earlier
case
involving
several
of
the
parties
in
1965
by
setting
up
a
receivership
over
the
public
schools
of
the
county,
public
funds
were
used
to
transport
the
whites
out
of
county
to
other
schools.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
record
only
shows
the
race
of
the
judge
now
in
office
as
white.
i
think
it
was
assumed
by
all
the
parties
and
the
district
court
that
there
never
had
been
one
at
least
in
the
preceding
80
years.
after
taking
evidence,
the
district
court
informed
the
jury
commissioners
and
school
board
members
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
and
that
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
school
board
could
not
continue.
the
court
ordered
the
defendants
to
make
an
attempt
to
remedy
the
situation
and
suggested
that
two
blacks
to
be
put
on
the
school
board
prior
to
a
reconvening
of
the
court
a
month
later.
the
jury
commissioners
during
this
period
recompiled
the
jury
list
placing
additional
negroes
on
it
and
a
new
grand
jury
was
selected.
however,
the
commissioners
excluded
a
171
negroes
and
only
seven
whites
because
they
failed
to
meet
the
statutory
requirement
that
jurors
be
intelligent
and
upright.
the
new
grand
jury
made
two
appointments
to
the
school
board.
one
was
a
white
man
and
one
was
a
black
man.
the
black
man
chosen
had
a
third
grade
education,
no
children
in
the
school
and
he
was
selected
without
the
public
notice
which
is
required
by
georgia
law.
on
the
basis
of
the
recomposition
of
the
jury
list,
the
addition
of
one
negro
to
the
school
board
and
its
view
as
to
the
constitutional
questions
presented,
the
district
court
merely
enjoined
future
racial
exclusion
in
selection
of
the
grand
jury
and
denied
further
relief.
appellants
first
contention
in
this
court
is
that
section
59-106
of
the
georgia
code
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
authorizing
jury
commissioners
to
exclude
men
who
they
believe
are
not
upright
and
intelligent.
now
certainly
these
terms
with
the
synonyms
used
by
georgia
officials
to
characterize
there
meaning,
the
word
like
understanding
or
honesty
are
words
which
have
no
commonly
accepted
meaning.
they
are
matters
of
personal
judgment
unless
they
are
tied
to
some
objective
standard
as
they
are
not
in
georgia.
there
are
several
consequences
to
their
use
which
supports
the
appellant’s
contention.
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
select
eligible
jury.
the
first
is
that
they
make
the
right
to
participate
in
the
institution
of
government
depend
on
the
will,
whim,
or
caprice
of
a
public
official.
the
court
has
condemned
placing
such
discretion
in
the
hands
of
voting
registrars
as
jury
commissioners
exercise
a
similar
function.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
different
rule
should
apply.
secondly,
because
men
cannot
agree
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
terms
to
their
application
to
particular
individuals,
they
always
command
arbitrary,
erratic
and
inconsistent
judgments
between
individuals.
thus
at
the
outset,
the
use
of
these
terms
seems
to
me
are
basically
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
due
process
of
law
that
more
rather
than
men
will
govern
whether
or
not
one
can
exercise
a
right.
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
21
plus
georgia
makes
22.
mr.
michael
meltsner
of
the
22
states
listed
in
the
jurisdictional
statements,
seven
are
in
the
south.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
a
language
is
often
vague
and
undefined
and
certainly
the
word
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
vague
word.
but
its
function
is
totally
different
from
the
function
that
these
words
--
its
function
is
to
guide
the
court
in
its
decision
of
cases
and
it
is
construed
by
the
court
in
accordance
with
history
and
its
own
decisions.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
i
think
that
this,
this
always
is
--
always
going
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
the
administration
drew
law
but
in
appraising
the
constitutionality
of
it,
one
has
to
look
at
the
function
involved
and
the
necessity
of
the
particular
bid
of
discretion.
now
here,
there
is
absolutely
no
necessity.
congress
has
passed
a
perfectly
satisfactory
jury
selection
statute
which
does
away
with
the
capacity
for
arbitrariness
and
discrimination
which
this
form
of
statute
has.
secondly,
a
jury
deciding
a
negligence
case
for
example
is
not
selecting
among
individuals
in
the
community.
it
is
perhaps
exercising
an
ad
hoc
judgment
which
in
certain
circumstances
the
law
allows.
the
question
is
whether
the
results
that
this
record
show
and
the
capacity
which
this
court
has
already
condemned
in
many,
many
other
areas
are
necessary
and
i
submit
that
they’re
not
here
and
that
there
is
no
state
interest
involved
in
allowing
the
jury
commissioners
this
much
discretion
to
select
among
individuals
at
their
will.
mr.
michael
meltsner
oh!
yes.
i
think
the
error
in
the
statute
here
is
--
the
infirmity
in
the
statute
is
the
arbitrary
power
which
it
confers.
now
the
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
which
this
record
has
in
abundance,
the
--
for
example
exclusion
of
a
171
of
a
178
persons
of
the
negro
race
under
this
standard
is
evidence
of
this
capacity
for
abuse,
quite
strong
evidence.
but
our
quarrel
would
still
exist
with
the
statute
because
the
statute
--
the
problem
with
the
statute
is
that
it
makes
almost
impossible
selection
between
individuals
which
is
not
erratic
and
which
does
not
depend
on
the
will
of
the
selecting
official.
now
i
think
another
thing
that
one
might
consider
here
is
that
it’s
totally
impossible
to
review
and
appraise
and
evaluate
the
decision
made
by
these
jury
commissioners.
we
can
disagree
with
what
they
say
when
it’s
a
all
171
of
these
are
178
persons
black
that
can’t
be.
but
one
can’t
get
in
there
and
prove
it.
one
can
evaluate
it,
one
can’t
review
it
and
that
is
a
function
as
this
court
has
always
apparently
employed
vagueness
analysis
to
permit.
unless
there
is
some
specificity,
there’s
absolutely
no
way
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
being
used
in
fact
to
discriminate
because
it
obviously
has
its
opportunity
for
discrimination.
the
jury
commissioner
need
only
pretend
that
the
negro
is
of
poor
character
and
little
intelligence
to
mask
his
discrimination.
and
therefore
it’s
not
surprising
that
a
171
of
these
persons
are
black.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
don’t
say
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
don’t
think
that’s
this
case
i
would
say
this.
i
would
say
this
that
clearly
the
other
jurisdiction
which
have
these
statutes
might
by
administrative
action
or
by
judicial
construction
apply
to
the
jury
selection
procedure,
the
sort
of
standards
and
confining
of
discretion
which
would
make
them
non-arbitrary.
but
our
quarrel
is
with
the
statute
on
its
face.
i
do
--
this
one
more
point
i
think
would
be
stressed
here
and
that
is
that
even
the
well
intention
and
sincere
jury
commissioner
is
offered
precious
indictments
for
these
terms
other
than
a
vague
sense
that
he
should
select
the
best
people
around.
and
it’s
all
too
lightly
then
that
he
will
select
the
persons
were
most
like
himself
when
the
persons
who
would
like
those
he
encounters
in
social
gatherings
and
quite
unconsciously
it
simplifises
exclude
blacks
who
he
does
not
come
in
contact
with.
mr.
michael
meltsner
certainly
it
would.
mr.
michael
meltsner
it
would
certainly
remove
from
him
the
capacity
to
disqualify
persons
on
the
basis
of
his
subjective
will,
his
subjective
understanding
of
these
illusive
concepts.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
as
this
statute
is
written,
this
is
clearly
a
disqualification
of
the
voters
who
are
at
the
beginning
deemed
eligible
and
that
is
in
fact
the
way
that’s
been
applied
in
this
particular
county,
the
--
what
the
jury
commissioners
do
is
they
take
the
voter
list,
they
sit
around
and
they
go
over
every
name
in
the
voter
list
and
they
say,
is
he
upright
and
intelligent,
and
they
cut
out
certain
number
of
persons
in
that
way.
if
their
authority
was
removed,
then
eligible
voters,
they
would
be
the
basic
source
still.
they
would
then
be
able
to
move
persons
who
were
in
insane
asylums
who
were
not
of
the
proper
age,
who
were
not
residing
the
county
so
what
they
would
then
have
the
source.
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
there
are
two
--
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
your
question
is
that
if
this
language
was
declared
void,
there
would
still
be
some
general
free
raging
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
jury
commissioners
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
would
agree
that
they
would
still
have
the
capacity
to
discriminate
as
any
one
administrating
a
system
does.
but
the
basis
on
which
they
have
justified
this
particular
discrimination
on
which
jury
officials
constantly
do
so
would
be
removed.
as
i
read
the
statute
in
light
of
there
practice
that
they
would
have
to
take
any
persons
who
did
not
meet
--
who
were
voters
and
were
not
excluded
for
specific
reasons
and
in
effect,
that
is
what
we
ask
this
court
to
so
hold
that
this
is
too
subjective
arbitrary
and
erratic
a
way
of
selecting
jurors.
the
state
may
come
back
and
pick
another
system
which
is
more
specific.
it
may
not.
mr.
michael
meltsner
more
objective
than
this.
mr.
michael
meltsner
that
is
correct.
now
there
is
one
more
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well,
i
think
that
the
401
would
find
consistent
results
of
that
sort
with
the
statute
of
this
kind.
they
would
have
to
have
been
brought
into
it.
some
form
of
objective
line
drawing
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
then
perhaps
the
--
as
a
litigant,
i
would
have
no
complaint
but
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
of
this
sort,
the
complaint
is
there
--
there
is
an
inherent
capacity
for
arbitrariness
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
my
position
is
that
in
this
case,
both
are
important,
both
are
here
and
that
the
court
should
decide
this
case.
but
i
must
take
the
position
that
the
vice
of
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
result.
the
result
merely
confirms
the
vice
which
we
see
in
it.
now,
the
infirmity
in
the
statute
is
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
infirmity
in
this
statute
is
in
its
grant
of
arbitrary
power.
just
as
in
the
licensing
field
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
that
a
litigant
in
a
class
excluded
would
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
yes,
i
certainly
do.
and
for
that,
i
wish
to
come
back
to
the
state
of
georgia
because
there’s
another
aspect
to
this
jury
system
which
i
think
the
court
ought
to
consider.
and
that’s
not
only
as
jury
selection
involved
here,
but
the
grand
jury
has
been
given
a
political
function
and
so
the
operation
of
the
statute
is
to
exclude
blacks
from
selecting
public
officials.
it’s
not
just
the
jury
system
that’s
involved
here.
it’s
excluding
black
people
in
this
county
from
choosing
school
board.
and
so
as
important
as
in
participating
in
the
administration
of
justices,
we
have
even
more
important
rights
at
stake
here.
my
second
claim
that
--
the
second
claim
that
we
wish
to
present
to
the
court
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
adequately
reform
the
system
of
jury
and
school
board
selection.
certainly,
if
the
court
strikes
down
the
broad
discretion
which
georgia
law
grants
the
jury
commissioners
that
will
no
doubt
make
far
more
likely
non-racial
jury
and
school
board
selection.
but
there
is
still
need
for
equitable
relief
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
to
make
it
unlikely
to
recur
in
the
future.
initially,
the
present
school
boards
still
has
on
it,
person
selected
by
grand
juries
which
for
themselves
unconstitutionally
selective.
and
one
step,
we
think
that
the
district
court
should
be
required
to
take
on
remand
is
to
vacate
the
membership
board
in
order
to
--
and
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
and
make
a
great
with
the
past.
more
fundamentally
to
make
sure
that
discrimination
does
not
recur,
at
a
minimum,
the
district
court
should
appoint
black
jury
commissioners
as
was
sort
in
the
complaint.
the
commissioners
play
critical
role
in
this
process
in
a
small
amount
of
discrimination
in
the
future
with
tip
control
with
the
grand
jury
to
whites.
they
have
discriminated
in
the
past.
they
have
--
there
has
never
been
a
black
jury
commissioner
and
the
whole
process
works
over
an
issue
which
blacks
in
this
county
have
enormous
interest.
whites
on
the
other
hand
have
no
interest
comparable
in
educational
quality.
i
think
it’s
a
little
like
the
voter
registration
act
if
i
can
use
that
--
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
if
i
can
use
that
analogy
where
the
statute
provided
that
under
certain
circumstances,
the
courts
might
appoint
voting
registrars
to
administer
even
a
non-discretionary
system
of
voting
registration.
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
activities
of
the
appellee
officials
here
makes
similar
relief
at
a
minimum
necessary.
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
upright
and
intelligent?
mr.
michael
meltsner
the
only
other
standard
aside
from
age
and
residence
is
that
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
residence.
is
that
idiots
and
lunatics
are
excluded.
mr.
michael
meltsner
idiots
and
lunatics
are
excluded.
that’s
the
only
other
standard.
mr.
michael
meltsner
upright
and
intelligent.
mr.
michael
meltsner
right.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
in
the
very
short
time
left,
i’m
going
to
try
and
deal
with
two
or
three
of
these
issues.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan,
assuming
that
the
court
eliminates
the
capacity
for
discrimination
in
the
upright
and
intelligence
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
strikes
that
down.
mr.
michael
meltsner
we
have
concluded
that
the
most
appropriate
remedy
is
for
the
district
court
to
try
and
make
this
system
of
selection
which
is
ingrained
in
state
law
work
and
we
think
the
way
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i’m
sorry.
we
have
concluded
that
if
this
statute
is
knocked
down
by
the
court,
our
challenge
is
successful
that
the
most
appropriate
way
for
the
district
court
to
assure
that
the
system
of
school
board
selection
and
jury
selection
works
is
to
appoint
black
jury
commissioners
to
put
them
in
this
process.
because
a
very
small
amounted
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
would
tip
the
balance
in
the
grand
jury
which
selects
the
school
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
well
not,
we
do
not
press
in
this
court
for
ancillary
damages
but
all
that
relief
may
be
appropriate
to
the
district
court
to
advice
a
system
which
will
assure
their
selection.
mr.
michael
meltsner
absolutely
not,
after
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment,
96%
of
the
persons
excluded
under
the
statutory
test
were
black.
declaratory
judgment
is
not
going
to
work.
now
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
question
as
to
the
freeholder
requirement,
this
is
just
something
i
wish
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
in
this
point
because
i
just
discovered
it
really
and
that
is
that
georgia
has
two
other
ways
of
selecting
school
boards.
one
is
a
--
local
law
may
be
passed
and
the
referendum
take
place
and
other
is
that
area
school
boards
may
be
created.
now
the
constitutional
provisions
which
provide
for
these
systems
of
selection
say
nothing
about
freeholders.
indeed,
they
delegate
to
the
voters
of
the
particular
communities,
the
power
to
set
qualifications.
thus,
there
can’t
be
very
much
of
a
state
interest
involved
here.
finally,
i
just
--
one
more
point
here.
mr.
justice
stewart,
these
statutes
with
the
exception
of
the
cross-section
to
the
community
language
are
all
reconstruction
statutes.
they
--
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
see.
finally,
i
just
wish
to
make
it
perfectly
clear.
we
do
not
disagree
that
a
state
has
an
interest
in
the
intelligent
and
upright
jurors.
we
merely
assert
that
the
test
involved
in
the
statute
is
not
the
way
to
achieve
that
end.
it
grants
too
much
discretion
and
invites
racial
discrimination.
mr.
michael
meltsner
i
think
some
of
them
definitely
will
but
i
think
in
most
of
them,
my
own
experience
is
that
in
most
of
them,
there
are
administrative
procedures
grafted
onto
them
which
make
the
selection
much
fairer
but
certainly
many
of
these
statutes
will
have
to
go.
