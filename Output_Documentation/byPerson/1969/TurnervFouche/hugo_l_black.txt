justice

how
do
you
suggest
that
as
possible
to
draw
a
statute
that
would
enable
people
who
are
mistreated
in
this
way
as
of
they
are
in
that
county
to
protect
that
interest
or
can
it
be
done
by
a
statute?
must
it
be
done
by
providing
the
proof
that
a
remedy
is
declared
is
the
result
such
as
affected
in
this
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
the
word
upright
but
in
no
judgment
the
tantamount
to
statement
citizens
of
integrity
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
contention
that
assuming
all
to
be
true
which
you
said
here
about
the
disproportionate
number,
colored
people
that
are
on
the
jury,
there
is
no
judicial
remedy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed?
or
that
the
case
should
be
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
their
remedy
the
judge
ordered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
one
black
man
on
the
school
board
but
what
does
that
do
with
reference
to
the
juries
hereafter?
what
does
the
order
of
the
court
do
his
reference
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
did
strike
down,
as
unconstitutional,
the
requirement
for
a
school
board
member
to
be
freeholder,
what
would
that
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
state
law
define
that
term
within
a
precision
freeholder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
require
the
ownership
of
real
estate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
that’s
done,
suppose
that’s
stricken
down.
they
are
not
required
to
be
freeholders,
what’s
left
here
that
we
can
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don’t
see
that
it
has
so
much
from
what
you
said
about
it
but
if
that
was
stricken,
what
would
be
the
situation
then
with
reference
to
the
other
complaints.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course
they
do
not
claim,
do
they?
that
they
should
not
be
upright
and
intelligent?
