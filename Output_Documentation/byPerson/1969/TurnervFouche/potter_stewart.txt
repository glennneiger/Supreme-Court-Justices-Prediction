the

that
last
function?
justice

and
the

himself
selects
32
from
how
many?
two-fifths
of
the
whole
--
justice

stewart
and
he
selects
those
subjectively
or
does
he
pick
them
in
some
random
objectively?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that
part
of
the
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
term
of
this
grand
jury,
how
long
does
it
stay
and
exists?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
term
of
the
school
board,
members
of
the
school
board
selected
by
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
grand
jury
performs
the
function,
whatever
that
happens
to
be
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
any
--
ever
been
a
non-white
superior
court
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
it
help
you
think
simply
to
take
these
adjectives
out?
justice
potter
stewart
that
wouldn’t
give
him
any
more
or
further
or
stricter
standards,
would
it
and
wouldn’t
give
them
any
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
with
those
standards
at
all
there
would
be
certainly
as
much
capacity
for
anybody
to
exercise
his
power
in
a
discriminatory
fashion?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
meltsner,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
saying
why
if
the
statute
which
now
reads
shall
comply
--
shall
compile
and
maintain
or
revise
a
jury
list
of
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
the
county
to
serve
as
jurors.
why
if
it
were
revised
jury
maintain
a
revised
jury
list
of
citizens
of
the
county
to
serve
as
jurors,
there
would
not
be
at
least
equal
capacity
for
a
jury
commissioner
to
discriminate
unfairly
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
even
more
so
if
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
rather
recent
statute
as
presently
worded,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
after
our
decision
in
whitus
against
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
sentence,
the
long
sentence
you
just
read
to
us,
i
won’t
repeat
it.
justice
potter
stewart
at
any
time
it
appears
for
the
jury
commissioner
that
the
jury
list
of
both
is
not
fairly
represented
and
so
on.
is
that
new
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
so.
justice

that
was
perhaps
because
there
were
not
many
fewer
pupils.
justice

for
pupil
expenditure.
justice

might
have
been
