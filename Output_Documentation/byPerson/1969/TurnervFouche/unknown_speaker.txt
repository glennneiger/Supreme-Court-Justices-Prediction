not

--
unknown

what
you’re
arguing
is
that
constitutionally
as
to
the
separate
objective
standards
that
you
know
what
the

right
and
your

in

as
i
get
in
your

in

with
what
the
practices
have
been
in
the
section
(inaudible).
unknown

does
that
have
to
do
with

unknown

or
you,
i
think
among

list
would
substitute
the
jurisdiction
you
say
is
learning
was
constant.
i
think
that
might

arizona
i
know
it,
do
you
think
you
can
make
this

that
of
what’s
the
duty
of
the

commissioners
that
would
be
anymore
definite
than
this

i
believe
you
said

well,
it’s
apparent
that
some
at
least
partial
relief
has
been
granted.

what
is
the

being
now
made

why
is
the

now?
unknown

perhaps
you
got
to

perhaps
i
should
wait

you.
unknown

well
tell
me
mr.
meltsner,
i
know
that
such
a
complaint
asked
that
on
the

statutes
struck
down
that
you
wanted
membership
on
the
board
of
education
and
jury
commission
to
be
declared
vacant,
a
receiver
be
appointed
to
operate
the
public

and
in
selection
of
constitutionally
acceptable
board
that
a
special
master
select
members
of
the
grand
and
petit
juries
and
that
ancillary
damages
be
worth.
do
you
still
press
for
all
that
relief?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
a
mere
declaratory
judgment
would
be
enough?
unknown

would
you
consider
that
if
