mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there’s
no
question
but
the
georgia’s
juror
selection
statute
is
capable
of
being
improperly
administered.
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
taliaferro
county,
georgia,
it
has
been
improperly
administered.
what
is
in
question
is
whether
georgia
of
for
that
matter
any
other
state
may
prescribe
juror
qualifications
which
call
for
an
exercise
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
public
board
or
public
officials
responsible
for
composing
the
jury
list.
this
is
the
true
question
before
the
court
for
two
simple
reasons.
first
of
all
is
self-evident
that
whenever
law
requires
judgment
to
be
exercised,
there
is
the
possibility,
they
will
be
exercised
improperly
or
wrongfully.
second,
because
of
the
capacity
and
people
being
as
they
are,
we
can
anticipate
that
from
time
to
time
statutes
providing
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
will
be
administered
improperly.
now
of
course
the
question
of
juror
qualifications
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
concept
of
trial
by
jury,
the
concept
which
this
court
just
a
little
more
than
one
year
ago
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
declared
to
be
“fundamental
to
the
american
scheme
of
justice.”
state
legislatures
including
georgia’s
general
assembly
have
quite
generally
supposed
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
means
trial
by
jurors
who
are
first
of
all
possessed
of
intelligence
sufficient
to
understand
the
matters
they
may
be
called
upon
to
judge.
and
secondly
that
they
shall
have
such
moral
character
as
will
enhance
the
possibility
of
a
fair
verdict.
some
example
of
the
character
and
intelligence
qualifications
of
the
various
states
are
included
at
pages
12
and
13
of
appellant’s
jurisdictional
statement.
we
think
both
the
statutes
are
essentially
indistinguishable
from
georgia.
maine
for
example
provides
qualifications
as
follows,
“of
good
moral
character,
of
approved
integrity,
of
sound
judgment,
and
well
informed.”
in
new
york,
it’s
of
good
character,
of
approved
integrity
and
sound
judgment.
in
michigan,
it’s
of
good
character,
of
approved
integrity,
of
sound
judgment,
and
well
informed.
nebraska
also
uses
intelligent,
of
fair
character,
of
approved
integrity,
and
well
informed.
now
this
court
in
the
past
has
always
adhered
to
the
view
that
such
character
and
intelligence
qualifications
are
at
the
very
least
consistent
with
if
not
required
by
the
constitution.
over
a
hundred
years
ago,
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
this
court
planned
out
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
never
intended
to
prevent
a
state
from
prescribing
such
qualifications
of
age
and
educational
qualifications
as
well.
more
recently
in
brown
versus
allen,
this
court
after
observing
that
state
should
decide
for
themselves
the
matter
of
the
quality
of
their
juries
stated
that
the
court
ought
not
to
impose
on
states,
its
conception
of
the
proper
source
of
jury
list
so
long
as
a
source
reasonably
reflects
a
cross-section
of
the
population
suitable
in
character
and
intelligence
for
this
civic
duty.
in
rejecting,
the
same
sort
of
attack
which
appellants
make
here,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
only
this
year
relied
upon
brown
versus
allen
in
the
case
of
sullivan
versus
state.
when
it
said
that
in
using
the
words
suitable
and
intelligence,
that
is
the
words
of
this
court.
the
supreme
court
must
necessarily
have
had
reference
to
good
character,
honorable
or
just
persons.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
continued
that
in
using
the
words
suitable
and
intelligence
for
that
civic
duty,
this
court
must
have
meant
persons
sufficiently
intelligent
to
serve
as
jurors.
now,
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
law
also
requires
the
jury
to
reflect
the
community.
i
read
from
georgia
statute
which
is
currently
in
effect
and
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
in
composing
such
jury
list,
the
commissioners
select
a
fairly
representative
cross-section
of
the
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
the
county
from
the
official
registered
voters
list
and
that
the
statute
goes
on.
if
at
any
time
it
appears
to
the
jury
commissioners
that
the
jury
list
so
composed
is
not
fairly
representative
cross-section
of
the
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
the
county,
they
shall
supplement
such
list
by
going
out
into
the
county
and
personally
acquainting
themselves
with
other
citizens
of
the
county
including
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
any
significantly
identifiable
group
in
the
county
which
may
not
be
fairly
represented
thereon.
we
think
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
statute
that
its
entire
thrust
is
to
avoid
discrimination
based
on
race
or
economic
status.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
it
is
in
part.
there
was
a
change
from
the
list
from
which
the
--
the
list
from
which
the
jury
list
was
derived
have
been
detached
list.
now,
it
is
the
voters
list
and
this
was
changed
in
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
whitus
and
also
avery
versus
georgia
to
meet
the
criticism
of
this
court
in
those
decisions.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
what
i
believe
that
particular
--
that
isn’t
an
issue
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
qualifications
as
to
character
and
intelligence
are
essential
to
the
proper
functioning
of
the
jury
system.
we
think
that
such
qualifications
are
at
least
consistent
with
if
not
required
by
the
constitution.
i’m
referring
specifically
to
the
sixth
and
seventh
amendments.
we
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
fill
these
qualifications
out
merely
because
they
have
a
capacity
to
be
wrongfully
employed.
we
think
that
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit
have
been
handling
matters
of
maladministration
quite
correctly
and
we
think
this
is
the
proper
approach.
two
questions
of
wrongful
administration
of
statutes
which
we
think
are
quite
clear
and
equitable
on
their
face.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
court
directed
a
revision
of
the
jury
list.
the
court
directed
that
the
jury
list
be
reconstituted
and
it
was
reconstituted
but
the
fifth
circuit
as
i’m
sure
mr.
justice
black
is
aware
in
labach
and
rabinowitz
has
consistently
stricken
the
administration
of
the
statute
without
becoming
really
involved
in
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
jury
commissioners
in
georgia
as
appointed
by
the
judge.
the
jury
commissioners
then
used
the
voters
list
as
the
principle
source
for
names
which
end
up
on
the
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
is
very
hard,
your
honor.
i
have
not
seen
a
statute
not
to
include
the
federal
statute
which
is
not
capable
of
being
abused.
now,
i
think
it
--
the
federal
statute
for
example
uses
such
word
as
incapable
of
rendering
satisfactory
jury
service.
if
a
person
was
bent
to
discrimination,
he
obviously
could
seize
upon
the
word
satisfactory.
we
have
an
inherit
vagueness
in
the
english
language.
words
cannot
reach
the
exact
intuitive
mathematical
equations.
we
think
that
actually
word
such
as
intelligent
and
character
are
reasonably
clear.
certainly
clear
enough
for
a
civil
statute
after
all.
in
criminal
cases,
we
permit
a
person
to
be
hanged
or
set
free
upon
evidence
of
his
reputation
in
the
community.
this
is
a
vague
thing.
reputation
in
the
community
but
is
it
admissible
evidence
in
many
instances
in
a
capital
felony.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don’t
know
if
it’s
in
the
statute
itself,
i
think
this
would
follow
by
the
random
approached
used.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
marshall
as
is
included
in
the
georgia
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
beg
to
disagree,
the
georgia
statute
does
have
one,
a
provision
in
their
providing
for
inclusion
of
broad
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
--
it
might
be
in
other
statutes.
it
is
not
in
the
statute
spelling
out
the
qualifications.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
it
in
fact
has
been
done
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
the
sullivan
decision
where
it
gave
a
bit
more
interpretation
to
the
words
intelligent.
it
stated
that
intelligence
in
the
context
of
the
selecting
jurors
meant
capacity
to
understand
the
matters
which
they
may
be
called
upon
to
judge.
that
is
of
course
more
definite
in
the
statute.
the
court
has
filled
in
a
gap
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
would
be
character
reputation.
as
i
said,
we
use,
we
allow
evidence
into
court
to
determine
whether
a
man
shall
be
hanged
to
set
free
based
upon
reputation
in
the
community,
if
we
can
hang
a
person,
i
think
we
can
also
decide
whether
or
not
he
should
be
eligible
to
deserve
on
a
jury
on
the
same
criteria.
reputation
in
the
community,
in
the
case
at
hand
there
was
testimony
that
they
consulted
with
the
sheriff
to
see
whether
or
not
the
individuals
under
consideration
had
a
criminal
record.
they
do
not
limit
themselves
to
this.
it
was
based
upon
general
reputation
in
the
community.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
sir
i
think
the
court
fashioned
appropriate
remedy.
the
jury
list
was
reconstituted,
the
--
it
was
primarily
drawn
by
lot
after
the
initial
elimination
due
to
various
qualifications,
now
much
was
made
of
the
179
persons
disqualified
because
they
lack
the
requisite
intelligence
or
character.
these
179
persons
amounted
to
only
8%
of
the
total
number
of
names
considered.
so
it
wasn’t
the
case
where
they
just
wholesale
eliminated
great
numbers
of
people.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
recomposition
of
the
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
has
been
done
and
the
first
act
i
might
add
of
the
newly
constituted
grand
jury
was
to
appoint
a
black
man
to
school
board.
that
was
the
first
act
done
by
the
newly
constituted
grand
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
enjoins
the
jury
commissioners
from
racially
discriminating
in
their
application
of
georgia
statute.
it
enjoins
further
racial
discrimination.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
i
might
mention,
this
came
up
in
a
rather
unusual
way.
the
court
held
a
hearing
in
the
nature
of
a
pretrial
hearing.
from
the
bench,
it
observed
that
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
appellants
had
made
out
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
it
recessed
the
hearing
and
advised
the
counsel
for
the
county
defendants
to
consult
with
his
clients
and
advice
them
as
to
the
fact
that
the
court
believed
that
the
jury
list
was
malconstituted.
at
that
time,
the
judge
--
the
state
judge
of
the
superior
court
on
his
own
motion
dismissed
both
the
traverse
and
the
grand
jury
and
ordered
the
jury
commissioners
to
reconstitute,
in
other
words
make
up
a
brand
new
jury
list.
this
was
done.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
traverse
and
grand
jury.
this
was
the
remedy
granted
by
the
trial
court,
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
did
not
order
about
that.
this
is
the
way
the
jury
commissioners
went
about
it.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
they
took
every
name
on
the
registered
voters
list
which
was
something
over
2,000.
they
then
disqualified
certain
numbers
because
of
age,
the
fact
that
they
were
out
of
the
county
most
of
the
time.
for
various
reasons,
they
disqualified
certain
numbers
of
citizens.
of
the
number
which
remained
after
the
disqualifications,
they
still
have
far
too
many
names.
they
put
them
in
alphabetical
order
and
selected
every
other
name.
at
this
point,
they
look
to
see
what
the
racial
composition
was
and
at
this
point
as
judge
they’ll
observe
from
the
bench,
there
was
only
a
difference
of
40
names
between
the
list
as
it
came
out
and
a
50/50
breakdown.
in
other
words,
it
was
fairly
closed.
then
they
drew
line.
they
put
all
the
names
into
the
jury
box
and
by
lot
drew
out
the
requisite
number
of
names
for
the
jury
list
and
also
the
grand
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
a
little
question
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
have
certain
difficulty
in
understanding
exactly
what
the
appellants
are
driving
at.
apparently
they
think
that
the
entire
membership
of
the
board
should
be
dismissed
or
somehow
pass
out
of
office
and
have
all
new
members
appointed.
that
is
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
i
was
speaking
of
the
board
of
education.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that
is
the
argument
as
i
understand
it.
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
case
actually
rose
over
the
composition
of
the
board
of
education,
the
fact
that
you
have
an
all
black
school
system
administered
by
an
all
white
board
of
education.
this
actually
was
the
problem
which
gave
rise
to
the
entire
litigation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir
i
don’t
really
believe
it
is
other
than
possibly
as
to
the
request
for
additional
--
or
other
remedy,
another
remedy.
the
appellants
do
say
that
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
remedy
granted
by
the
district
court.
we
think
the
remedy
was
adequate.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
was
just
now
coming
to
the
freeholder
point.
there
are
two
points
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
are
more
or
less
asking
for
a
suspension
of
georgia’s
statutes
in
taliaferro
county.
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
have
abandoned
their
attack
on
the
various
statutes
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
jury
statute
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
that’s
correct.
the
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
board
of
education
of
course
has
selected
for
a
five-year
term
and
just
removing
the
present
grand
jury
would
not
affect
these
officers.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
not
a
thing
mr.
justice
black,
not
a
thing.
i
have
not
yet
come
to
the
freeholder
point
but
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
point.
first
of
all,
and
i
will
just
touch
on
this,
we
do
not
think
this
question
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
principle
plaintiff,
calvin
turner
in
fact
was
a
freeholder,
is
a
freeholder.
the
evident
shows
that
great
numbers
of
the
black
citizens
of
taliaferro
county
are
in
fact
freeholders.
they
did
subsequently
permit
an
intervention
of
a
person
who
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
sir?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don’t
know
but
the
word
in
court
--
the
word
in
court
was
great.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
great
numbers
is
what
the
word
in
court
was,
great
numbers.
the
court
observed
from
the
bench
that
there
was
no
question
here
where
the
--
as
to
the
requirement
discriminating
against
black
citizens.
but
i
have
two
points
on
the
freeholder.
first
we
think
that
is
not
before
the
court,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
anyone
much
less
these
plaintiffs
has
been
denied
a
position
on
the
board
of
education
because
of
the
freeholder
requirement.
secondly
of
course,
we
think
that
if
we
get
to
the
merits
of
the
problem,
we
think
the
law
is
that
there
is
nothing
improper
about
a
freeholder
requirement
for
a
public
office.
this
court
has
so
held
twice,
they
are
rather
old
decisions.
the
first
was
strauder
versus
virginia
and
the
second
was
vought
versus
wisconsin
and
each
case
the
court
held
that
there
was
nothing
improper
about
a
freeholder
requirement
for
a
public
official.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
i
believe
the
requirement
could
be
met
by
the
purchase
of
one
square
inch
of
realty.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
any
standard
as
far
as
the
amount
of
realty
one
must
own
to
be
a
freeholder.
i
think
it’s
rather
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does
require.
freeholder
is
one
who
owns
real
estate.
the
statute
does
require
a
board
member
to
be
a
freeholder.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
really
don’t
think
of
course
striking
the
freeholder
would
have
any
bearing
on
this
particular
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
presume,
i
cannot
speak
for
appellants.
i
presume
that
their
other
complaints
would
continue.
their
essential
complaint
as
i
see
it
is
the
attack
on
the
upright
and
intelligent
qualification
for
grand
--
for
jurors.
as
i
see
it,
that
is
the
principle
question
before
the
court
today.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir
they
obviously
do
not
maintain.
they
should
not
be.
they
say
that
the
standard
is
too
vague.
we
can
only
submit
--
we
think
it’s
a
rather
clear
standard.
in
fact,
sometimes
i
think
when
you
consider
constitutional
attacks
of
vagueness
on
a
word
like
intelligent
or
upright
in
the
context
of
a
juror
i
think
that
one
would
perhaps
have
to
be
a
lawyer
not
to
understand
it.
it’s
a
word
that’s
been
commonly
used
for
at
least
a
hundred
years
in
georgia
and
is
never
even
been
attacked
until
recently.
yes,
but
anyway
it’s
a
word
that
is
easily
understood.
only
year
ago
in
cameron,
this
court
upheld
in
a
criminal
statute
where
the
standard
is
higher.
it
upheld
unreasonable
interference.
well,
that
can
be
a
vague
phrase
too.
this
would
involve
the
picketing
case
and
demonstrations
on
the
street
and
this
court
said
it
was
perfectly
clear
the
phrase
unreasonably
interfere.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
contract
--
in
the
context
of
juror
selection,
i
think
that
words
like
reason
on
upright
are
not
difficult
words.
it’s
a
simple
reputation
of
community
as
far
as
the
character
qualification,
as
far
as
intelligence.
it
is
as
a
georgia
supreme
court
declared
as
the
chairman
of
the
jury
commissioners
declared.
it
is
capacity
to
understand
what
it
going
on
in
court.
we
think
that
this
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
a
jury
system.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
defend.
we
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
standard.
i
say
i
emphasize
that
word
because
i
do
think
it
would
be
perfectly
candid.
i
think
it’s
open
to
question
as
to
its
wisdom.
i
might
add
that
very
recently
i
recommended
to
the
georgia
constitutional
revision
committee
that
be
deleted.
i
personally
don’t
like
it
but
i
do
think
it
is
not
unreasonable.
if
the
court
would
like
a
reason
to
--
i
could
point
out
that
members
of
the
board
of
education
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
fixing
the
tax
rate.
it
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
to
say
that
it
might
be
desirable
to
have
persons
who
are
directly
affected
by
property
taxes.
it
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
to
feel
that
they
might
be
perhaps
a
bit
more
prudent
in
the
expenditure
of
public
funds.
we
think
that
the
voting
rights
cases
such
as
harper,
cipriano
and
kramer
are
not
after
a
poll.
the
reason
they
are
not
after
poll
is
clearly
a
state
as
the
federal
government
can
prescribe
different
and
higher
standards
for
the
holding
of
public
office
than
for
voting.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
burger,
this
probably
would
be
a
danger.
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
particular
case
shows
that
between
the
time
the
white
pupil
has
left
the
school
system
and
the
time
of
the
litigation
that
per
pupil
expenditure
went
up
not
down.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i’m
talking
of
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
for
pupil
expenditure.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
possible
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
per
pupil
expenditure
did
go
up
not
down.
they
did
not
reduce
the
taxes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there’s
no
question
but
the
georgia’s
juror
selection
statute
is
capable
of
being
improperly
administered.
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
taliaferro
county,
georgia,
it
has
been
improperly
administered.
what
is
in
question
is
whether
georgia
of
for
that
matter
any
other
state
may
prescribe
juror
qualifications
which
call
for
an
exercise
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
public
board
or
public
officials
responsible
for
composing
the
jury
list.
this
is
the
true
question
before
the
court
for
two
simple
reasons.
first
of
all
is
self-evident
that
whenever
law
requires
judgment
to
be
exercised,
there
is
the
possibility,
they
will
be
exercised
improperly
or
wrongfully.
second,
because
of
the
capacity
and
people
being
as
they
are,
we
can
anticipate
that
from
time
to
time
statutes
providing
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
will
be
administered
improperly.
now
of
course
the
question
of
juror
qualifications
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
concept
of
trial
by
jury,
the
concept
which
this
court
just
a
little
more
than
one
year
ago
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
declared
to
be
“fundamental
to
the
american
scheme
of
justice.”
state
legislatures
including
georgia’s
general
assembly
have
quite
generally
supposed
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
means
trial
by
jurors
who
are
first
of
all
possessed
of
intelligence
sufficient
to
understand
the
matters
they
may
be
called
upon
to
judge.
and
secondly
that
they
shall
have
such
moral
character
as
will
enhance
the
possibility
of
a
fair
verdict.
some
example
of
the
character
and
intelligence
qualifications
of
the
various
states
are
included
at
pages
12
and
13
of
appellant’s
jurisdictional
statement.
we
think
both
the
statutes
are
essentially
indistinguishable
from
georgia.
maine
for
example
provides
qualifications
as
follows,
“of
good
moral
character,
of
approved
integrity,
of
sound
judgment,
and
well
informed.”
in
new
york,
it’s
of
good
character,
of
approved
integrity
and
sound
judgment.
in
michigan,
it’s
of
good
character,
of
approved
integrity,
of
sound
judgment,
and
well
informed.
nebraska
also
uses
intelligent,
of
fair
character,
of
approved
integrity,
and
well
informed.
now
this
court
in
the
past
has
always
adhered
to
the
view
that
such
character
and
intelligence
qualifications
are
at
the
very
least
consistent
with
if
not
required
by
the
constitution.
over
a
hundred
years
ago,
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
this
court
planned
out
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
never
intended
to
prevent
a
state
from
prescribing
such
qualifications
of
age
and
educational
qualifications
as
well.
more
recently
in
brown
versus
allen,
this
court
after
observing
that
state
should
decide
for
themselves
the
matter
of
the
quality
of
their
juries
stated
that
the
court
ought
not
to
impose
on
states,
its
conception
of
the
proper
source
of
jury
list
so
long
as
a
source
reasonably
reflects
a
cross-section
of
the
population
suitable
in
character
and
intelligence
for
this
civic
duty.
in
rejecting,
the
same
sort
of
attack
which
appellants
make
here,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
only
this
year
relied
upon
brown
versus
allen
in
the
case
of
sullivan
versus
state.
when
it
said
that
in
using
the
words
suitable
and
intelligence,
that
is
the
words
of
this
court.
the
supreme
court
must
necessarily
have
had
reference
to
good
character,
honorable
or
just
persons.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
continued
that
in
using
the
words
suitable
and
intelligence
for
that
civic
duty,
this
court
must
have
meant
persons
sufficiently
intelligent
to
serve
as
jurors.
now,
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
law
also
requires
the
jury
to
reflect
the
community.
i
read
from
georgia
statute
which
is
currently
in
effect
and
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
in
composing
such
jury
list,
the
commissioners
select
a
fairly
representative
cross-section
of
the
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
the
county
from
the
official
registered
voters
list
and
that
the
statute
goes
on.
if
at
any
time
it
appears
to
the
jury
commissioners
that
the
jury
list
so
composed
is
not
fairly
representative
cross-section
of
the
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
the
county,
they
shall
supplement
such
list
by
going
out
into
the
county
and
personally
acquainting
themselves
with
other
citizens
of
the
county
including
intelligent
and
upright
citizens
of
any
significantly
identifiable
group
in
the
county
which
may
not
be
fairly
represented
thereon.
we
think
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
statute
that
its
entire
thrust
is
to
avoid
discrimination
based
on
race
or
economic
status.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir.
it
is
in
part.
there
was
a
change
from
the
list
from
which
the
--
the
list
from
which
the
jury
list
was
derived
have
been
detached
list.
now,
it
is
the
voters
list
and
this
was
changed
in
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
whitus
and
also
avery
versus
georgia
to
meet
the
criticism
of
this
court
in
those
decisions.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
what
i
believe
that
particular
--
that
isn’t
an
issue
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
qualifications
as
to
character
and
intelligence
are
essential
to
the
proper
functioning
of
the
jury
system.
we
think
that
such
qualifications
are
at
least
consistent
with
if
not
required
by
the
constitution.
i’m
referring
specifically
to
the
sixth
and
seventh
amendments.
we
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
fill
these
qualifications
out
merely
because
they
have
a
capacity
to
be
wrongfully
employed.
we
think
that
the
courts
of
the
fifth
circuit
have
been
handling
matters
of
maladministration
quite
correctly
and
we
think
this
is
the
proper
approach.
two
questions
of
wrongful
administration
of
statutes
which
we
think
are
quite
clear
and
equitable
on
their
face.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
court
directed
a
revision
of
the
jury
list.
the
court
directed
that
the
jury
list
be
reconstituted
and
it
was
reconstituted
but
the
fifth
circuit
as
i’m
sure
mr.
justice
black
is
aware
in
labach
and
rabinowitz
has
consistently
stricken
the
administration
of
the
statute
without
becoming
really
involved
in
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
jury
commissioners
in
georgia
as
appointed
by
the
judge.
the
jury
commissioners
then
used
the
voters
list
as
the
principle
source
for
names
which
end
up
on
the
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
it
is
very
hard,
your
honor.
i
have
not
seen
a
statute
not
to
include
the
federal
statute
which
is
not
capable
of
being
abused.
now,
i
think
it
--
the
federal
statute
for
example
uses
such
word
as
incapable
of
rendering
satisfactory
jury
service.
if
a
person
was
bent
to
discrimination,
he
obviously
could
seize
upon
the
word
satisfactory.
we
have
an
inherit
vagueness
in
the
english
language.
words
cannot
reach
the
exact
intuitive
mathematical
equations.
we
think
that
actually
word
such
as
intelligent
and
character
are
reasonably
clear.
certainly
clear
enough
for
a
civil
statute
after
all.
in
criminal
cases,
we
permit
a
person
to
be
hanged
or
set
free
upon
evidence
of
his
reputation
in
the
community.
this
is
a
vague
thing.
reputation
in
the
community
but
is
it
admissible
evidence
in
many
instances
in
a
capital
felony.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don’t
know
if
it’s
in
the
statute
itself,
i
think
this
would
follow
by
the
random
approached
used.
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
marshall
as
is
included
in
the
georgia
statute.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
beg
to
disagree,
the
georgia
statute
does
have
one,
a
provision
in
their
providing
for
inclusion
of
broad
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
is
--
it
might
be
in
other
statutes.
it
is
not
in
the
statute
spelling
out
the
qualifications.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
it
in
fact
has
been
done
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
the
sullivan
decision
where
it
gave
a
bit
more
interpretation
to
the
words
intelligent.
it
stated
that
intelligence
in
the
context
of
the
selecting
jurors
meant
capacity
to
understand
the
matters
which
they
may
be
called
upon
to
judge.
that
is
of
course
more
definite
in
the
statute.
the
court
has
filled
in
a
gap
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
would
be
character
reputation.
as
i
said,
we
use,
we
allow
evidence
into
court
to
determine
whether
a
man
shall
be
hanged
to
set
free
based
upon
reputation
in
the
community,
if
we
can
hang
a
person,
i
think
we
can
also
decide
whether
or
not
he
should
be
eligible
to
deserve
on
a
jury
on
the
same
criteria.
reputation
in
the
community,
in
the
case
at
hand
there
was
testimony
that
they
consulted
with
the
sheriff
to
see
whether
or
not
the
individuals
under
consideration
had
a
criminal
record.
they
do
not
limit
themselves
to
this.
it
was
based
upon
general
reputation
in
the
community.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
well,
sir
i
think
the
court
fashioned
appropriate
remedy.
the
jury
list
was
reconstituted,
the
--
it
was
primarily
drawn
by
lot
after
the
initial
elimination
due
to
various
qualifications,
now
much
was
made
of
the
179
persons
disqualified
because
they
lack
the
requisite
intelligence
or
character.
these
179
persons
amounted
to
only
8%
of
the
total
number
of
names
considered.
so
it
wasn’t
the
case
where
they
just
wholesale
eliminated
great
numbers
of
people.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
recomposition
of
the
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
has
been
done
and
the
first
act
i
might
add
of
the
newly
constituted
grand
jury
was
to
appoint
a
black
man
to
school
board.
that
was
the
first
act
done
by
the
newly
constituted
grand
jury.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it
enjoins
the
jury
commissioners
from
racially
discriminating
in
their
application
of
georgia
statute.
it
enjoins
further
racial
discrimination.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
i
might
mention,
this
came
up
in
a
rather
unusual
way.
the
court
held
a
hearing
in
the
nature
of
a
pretrial
hearing.
from
the
bench,
it
observed
that
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
appellants
had
made
out
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
it
recessed
the
hearing
and
advised
the
counsel
for
the
county
defendants
to
consult
with
his
clients
and
advice
them
as
to
the
fact
that
the
court
believed
that
the
jury
list
was
malconstituted.
at
that
time,
the
judge
--
the
state
judge
of
the
superior
court
on
his
own
motion
dismissed
both
the
traverse
and
the
grand
jury
and
ordered
the
jury
commissioners
to
reconstitute,
in
other
words
make
up
a
brand
new
jury
list.
this
was
done.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
traverse
and
grand
jury.
this
was
the
remedy
granted
by
the
trial
court,
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
did
not
order
about
that.
this
is
the
way
the
jury
commissioners
went
about
it.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
they
took
every
name
on
the
registered
voters
list
which
was
something
over
2,000.
they
then
disqualified
certain
numbers
because
of
age,
the
fact
that
they
were
out
of
the
county
most
of
the
time.
for
various
reasons,
they
disqualified
certain
numbers
of
citizens.
of
the
number
which
remained
after
the
disqualifications,
they
still
have
far
too
many
names.
they
put
them
in
alphabetical
order
and
selected
every
other
name.
at
this
point,
they
look
to
see
what
the
racial
composition
was
and
at
this
point
as
judge
they’ll
observe
from
the
bench,
there
was
only
a
difference
of
40
names
between
the
list
as
it
came
out
and
a
50/50
breakdown.
in
other
words,
it
was
fairly
closed.
then
they
drew
line.
they
put
all
the
names
into
the
jury
box
and
by
lot
drew
out
the
requisite
number
of
names
for
the
jury
list
and
also
the
grand
jury
list.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
a
little
question
there.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
have
certain
difficulty
in
understanding
exactly
what
the
appellants
are
driving
at.
apparently
they
think
that
the
entire
membership
of
the
board
should
be
dismissed
or
somehow
pass
out
of
office
and
have
all
new
members
appointed.
that
is
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
i
was
speaking
of
the
board
of
education.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
that
is
the
argument
as
i
understand
it.
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
this
case
actually
rose
over
the
composition
of
the
board
of
education,
the
fact
that
you
have
an
all
black
school
system
administered
by
an
all
white
board
of
education.
this
actually
was
the
problem
which
gave
rise
to
the
entire
litigation.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir
i
don’t
really
believe
it
is
other
than
possibly
as
to
the
request
for
additional
--
or
other
remedy,
another
remedy.
the
appellants
do
say
that
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
remedy
granted
by
the
district
court.
we
think
the
remedy
was
adequate.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
was
just
now
coming
to
the
freeholder
point.
there
are
two
points
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir,
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
are
more
or
less
asking
for
a
suspension
of
georgia’s
statutes
in
taliaferro
county.
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
have
abandoned
their
attack
on
the
various
statutes
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
jury
statute
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
that’s
correct.
the
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
the
board
of
education
of
course
has
selected
for
a
five-year
term
and
just
removing
the
present
grand
jury
would
not
affect
these
officers.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
think
not
a
thing
mr.
justice
black,
not
a
thing.
i
have
not
yet
come
to
the
freeholder
point
but
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
point.
first
of
all,
and
i
will
just
touch
on
this,
we
do
not
think
this
question
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
principle
plaintiff,
calvin
turner
in
fact
was
a
freeholder,
is
a
freeholder.
the
evident
shows
that
great
numbers
of
the
black
citizens
of
taliaferro
county
are
in
fact
freeholders.
they
did
subsequently
permit
an
intervention
of
a
person
who
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
sir?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
of?
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
don’t
know
but
the
word
in
court
--
the
word
in
court
was
great.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
great
numbers
is
what
the
word
in
court
was,
great
numbers.
the
court
observed
from
the
bench
that
there
was
no
question
here
where
the
--
as
to
the
requirement
discriminating
against
black
citizens.
but
i
have
two
points
on
the
freeholder.
first
we
think
that
is
not
before
the
court,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
anyone
much
less
these
plaintiffs
has
been
denied
a
position
on
the
board
of
education
because
of
the
freeholder
requirement.
secondly
of
course,
we
think
that
if
we
get
to
the
merits
of
the
problem,
we
think
the
law
is
that
there
is
nothing
improper
about
a
freeholder
requirement
for
a
public
office.
this
court
has
so
held
twice,
they
are
rather
old
decisions.
the
first
was
strauder
versus
virginia
and
the
second
was
vought
versus
wisconsin
and
each
case
the
court
held
that
there
was
nothing
improper
about
a
freeholder
requirement
for
a
public
official.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
i
believe
the
requirement
could
be
met
by
the
purchase
of
one
square
inch
of
realty.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
any
standard
as
far
as
the
amount
of
realty
one
must
own
to
be
a
freeholder.
i
think
it’s
rather
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does
require.
freeholder
is
one
who
owns
real
estate.
the
statute
does
require
a
board
member
to
be
a
freeholder.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
really
don’t
think
of
course
striking
the
freeholder
would
have
any
bearing
on
this
particular
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i
presume,
i
cannot
speak
for
appellants.
i
presume
that
their
other
complaints
would
continue.
their
essential
complaint
as
i
see
it
is
the
attack
on
the
upright
and
intelligent
qualification
for
grand
--
for
jurors.
as
i
see
it,
that
is
the
principle
question
before
the
court
today.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no
sir
they
obviously
do
not
maintain.
they
should
not
be.
they
say
that
the
standard
is
too
vague.
we
can
only
submit
--
we
think
it’s
a
rather
clear
standard.
in
fact,
sometimes
i
think
when
you
consider
constitutional
attacks
of
vagueness
on
a
word
like
intelligent
or
upright
in
the
context
of
a
juror
i
think
that
one
would
perhaps
have
to
be
a
lawyer
not
to
understand
it.
it’s
a
word
that’s
been
commonly
used
for
at
least
a
hundred
years
in
georgia
and
is
never
even
been
attacked
until
recently.
yes,
but
anyway
it’s
a
word
that
is
easily
understood.
only
year
ago
in
cameron,
this
court
upheld
in
a
criminal
statute
where
the
standard
is
higher.
it
upheld
unreasonable
interference.
well,
that
can
be
a
vague
phrase
too.
this
would
involve
the
picketing
case
and
demonstrations
on
the
street
and
this
court
said
it
was
perfectly
clear
the
phrase
unreasonably
interfere.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
contract
--
in
the
context
of
juror
selection,
i
think
that
words
like
reason
on
upright
are
not
difficult
words.
it’s
a
simple
reputation
of
community
as
far
as
the
character
qualification,
as
far
as
intelligence.
it
is
as
a
georgia
supreme
court
declared
as
the
chairman
of
the
jury
commissioners
declared.
it
is
capacity
to
understand
what
it
going
on
in
court.
we
think
that
this
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
a
jury
system.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
defend.
we
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
standard.
i
say
i
emphasize
that
word
because
i
do
think
it
would
be
perfectly
candid.
i
think
it’s
open
to
question
as
to
its
wisdom.
i
might
add
that
very
recently
i
recommended
to
the
georgia
constitutional
revision
committee
that
be
deleted.
i
personally
don’t
like
it
but
i
do
think
it
is
not
unreasonable.
if
the
court
would
like
a
reason
to
--
i
could
point
out
that
members
of
the
board
of
education
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
fixing
the
tax
rate.
it
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
to
say
that
it
might
be
desirable
to
have
persons
who
are
directly
affected
by
property
taxes.
it
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
to
feel
that
they
might
be
perhaps
a
bit
more
prudent
in
the
expenditure
of
public
funds.
we
think
that
the
voting
rights
cases
such
as
harper,
cipriano
and
kramer
are
not
after
a
poll.
the
reason
they
are
not
after
poll
is
clearly
a
state
as
the
federal
government
can
prescribe
different
and
higher
standards
for
the
holding
of
public
office
than
for
voting.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
mr.
justice
burger,
this
probably
would
be
a
danger.
i
would
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
particular
case
shows
that
between
the
time
the
white
pupil
has
left
the
school
system
and
the
time
of
the
litigation
that
per
pupil
expenditure
went
up
not
down.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
i’m
talking
of
--
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
for
pupil
expenditure.
mr.
alfred
l.
evans,
jr.
it’s
possible
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
per
pupil
expenditure
did
go
up
not
down.
they
did
not
reduce
the
taxes.
