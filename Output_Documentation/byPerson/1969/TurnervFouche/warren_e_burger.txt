you
may

whenever
you’re
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
suggest
that
these
words
--
i
think
you
put
it
command
confusion.
do
you
think
they
are
any
less
broad
than
the
term
unreasonable
for
example
in
the
fourth
amendment
providing
to
searches?
chief

warren
e.

well
then
how
about
the
situation
when
a
trial
judge
instructs
the
jury
on
a
reasonable
man
standard.
now
that’s
an
explicit
--
the
explicit
purpose
to
that
instruction
is
to
afford
guidelines
to
the
jury,
is
that
guideline
any
less
difficult
than
the
one
you
are
confronted
with
here?
chief

warren
e.

suppose,
if
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
for
example
the
record
in
this
case
now
showed
that
to
a
change
in
attitude
and
change
of
heart
the
selection
of
these
people
was
made
on
the
result
of
about
45-55
in
one
term
and
55-45
the
next
time
and
was
roughly
over
a
long
period
of

balanced
in
the
way
that
reflected
approximately

very
nearly
approximately
the
population
balance
of
a

would
you
quarrel
then
be
with
the
--
still
be
with
the
statute?
chief

warren
e.

in
my
hypothetical
if
the

where
as
i
suggested
in

hypothetical
situation
which
is
the
lack
of
basis
for
complaint?
chief

warren
e.

don’t
you
say
that’s
a
long
way.
chief

e.
burger
that
brings
me
back
--
that
brings
me
back
in
my
hypothetical,
let
me
alter
a
little
bit.
suppose
the
record
show
that
the
recent
years
since
they’re
going
to
change
of
heart
and
attitude
that
70%
of
the
persons
selected
by
the
jury
commissioner
had
been
negro
and
only
30%
white.
on
what
basis
would
you
attack
the
statute?
chief

warren
e.
burger
but
what
would
be
your
complaint
in
that
factual
setting?
chief

warren
e.

doesn’t
that
bring
us
back
to
just
what
you
had
discussed
with
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
that
it’s
the
practice
not
the
statute
that
is
the
vice
here?
it’s
what
being
done,
not
what
could
be
done
which
is
important?
chief

warren
e.

mr.
evans.
chief

when
you

these

fixing
the
taxes
or
fixing

for
the

all

then
that

another

would
you
not
agree
potential
for
carrying
prudence
too
far?
