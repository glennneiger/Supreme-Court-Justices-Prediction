mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i
believe
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
presentation
of
counsel's
facts.
admittedly,
approximately
four
nights
before
the
night
his
client
was
arrested,
this
particular
house
in
roanoke
rapids,
north
carolina
was
broken
into
and
the
female
occupant
raped.
as
a
result,
the
house
was
put
under
surveillance
and
it
occurred
to
approximately
11
pm
on
that
sunday
night.
and
now
at
approximately
11
pm
four
nights
later,
thursday
night
the
house
is
under
surveillance
and
the
youth
is
viewed
as
he
comes
upon
the
grounds
and
comes
to
the
door
at
that
point
he
is
arrested,
at
gun
point
of
course,
naturally.
he
was
then
brought
to
the
police
station,
it's
now
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
four
nights
later
when
he
comes
back
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
house
was
under
surveillance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
no
your
honor,
of
course
not.
he
was
brought
to
the
police
station
for
interrogation.
he
refused
to
tell
his
name,
refused
to
tell
where
he
was
from.
he
was
interrogated
for
approximately
two
hours.
he
was
put
in
a
cell
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening.
this
is
from
approximately
1:00
at
night
on,
but
they're
not
--
i
would
not
believe
that
the
cell
was
dimly
lit
or
not
lit
at
all
for
the
middle
of
the
night.
he
hadn't
told
the
police
officers
who
he
was
or
where
he'd
come
from.
the
police
officers
had
to
find
out
who
he
was
independently
and
having
determined
independently
who
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
approximately
3:30
or
4:30,
they
went
to
the
mother's
house
and
told
the
mother
that
her
son
was
in
custody.
and
if
they
said,
don't
bother
coming
now
or
whatever
they
might
have
said,
i
don't
know,
but
the
next
morning
at
sun
rise,
the
mother
was
on
the
door
steps
of
a
very
competent
law
firm
in
roanoke
rapids,
north
carolina
waiting
for
the
doors
to
open
up
and
as
soon
as
an
attorney
came
in,
she
employed
mr.
cranford.
almost
contemporaneously,
the
defendant
was
interrogated
again
early
that
morning,
this
is
before
counsel
was
employed
and
he
admitted
and
confessed
to
the
crime.
counsel
arrived
on
the
scene
having
been
hired
by
the
mother
just
a
few
minutes
after
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
cranford.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
this
was
privately
retained
counsel
george
o.
cranford
of
the
roanoke
rapids
bar.
he
arrived
and
he
asked
the
petitioner,
this
is
in
the
record
just
a
few
minutes
later,
was
he
scared
and
whether
the
attorney
questioned
petitioner
is
to
whether
when
he
made
the
confession
had
he
threatened
in
any
manner,
whether
any
promises
were
made
to
him
and
whether
he
was
scared
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement,
this
is
in
the
record.
petitioner
told
counsel
that
no
threats
or
promises
had
been
made
then
he
was
not
scared.
for
two
days
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
completely
undisputed
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
undisputed,
that's
on
page
67
of
the
appendix.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
or
when
the
case
was
on
the
docket
for
that
term
for
two
days
preceding
the
trial,
counsel
spent
these
two
days
with
petitioner
and
his
mother
and
a
written
authorization
was
prepared
as
required
by
north
carolina
law
upon
the
submission
of
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
case.
the
law
requires
that
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
case
be
in
writing.
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
finally
retained
counsel,
mr.
cranford
after
these
two
days
that
he
spent
with
the
defendant
and
his
mother,
called
in
a
fellow
member
of
the
bar
to
witness
the
execution
of
the
authorization.
this
fellow
member
of
the
bar
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
in
his
own
right
interrogated
the
defendant
and
his
mother
at
the
time
the
defendant
signed
the
written
authorization,
this
is
in
the
record
too.
that's
in
the
appendix,
page
73,
charlie
d.
clark
jr.
attorney
at
law
in
roanoke
rapids
wanted
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
petitioner
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
the
consequences
of
his
act.
the
written
tender
of
the
plea
of
guilty
was
submitted
to
the
court.
it
was
accepted
by
the
solicitor
in
writing
and
was
accepted
by
the
judge.
the
court,
this
is
in
the
record,
interrogated
the
defendant
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea
and
the
court
also
interrogated
the
defendant's
mother
in
the
courtroom,
whereupon,
the
mandatory
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
was
imposed.
from
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
was
15,
your
honor.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
believe
a
discussion
is
necessary
upon
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
involuntary,
i
believe
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
and
of
course
the
jackson
defect,
we
have
previously
argued.
i'd
like
to
spend
some
time
on
this
question
of
grand
jury
discrimination.
mr.
smith
was
the
post
conviction
attorney.
he
represented
mr.
parker
at
the
post
conviction.
the
only
witness
put
on
the
stand
was
a
register
of
deeds
of
halifax
county
and
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
smith's
witness
or
mr.
wilson's
testimony,
it
was
apparent
that
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
that
the
--
then
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
was
that
the
names
for
the
grand
jury
were
selected
from
the
tax
rolls.
admittedly,
at
that
time,
there
were
tax
rolls
maintain
for
both
caucasian
and
white
--
excuse
me
caucasian
and
negro,
this
is
subsequently
been
changed
by
statute
and
no
longer
exist.
the
tax
rolls
had
to
prepare
that
way
but
the
names
in
the
jury
box
had
no
indication,
no
racial
discrimination.
the
testimony
presented
by
mr.
smith's
witness
show
that
the
jury
commissioners
came
from
different
parts
of
the
county,
selected
individuals
who
were
known
to
them
to
be
of
good
moral
character
that
the
same
criteria
were
applied
uniformly.
now,
i
submit
that
perhaps
what
we
get
to
in
this
instance
is
something
akin
to
the
former
blue
ribbon
grand
jury
selection
used
in
the
federal
district
courts.
there
is
no
deliberate
showing
of
racial
exclusion,
merely
a
showing
that
these
jury
commissioners
pick
up
people
known
to
them
to
be
a
good
moral
character.
perhaps
of
any
issue
confronting
this
court
today,
this
issue
could
perhaps
to
be
most
vital
because
it
is
counsel's
contention
here
that
unless
there
is
a
free,
voluntary
and
knowing
waiver
of
the
right
to
attack
the
grand
jury
that
that
attack
can
be
made
at
any
time.
so,
it
would
appear
that
not
only
upon
a
plea
of
guilty,
if
counsel's
arguments
were
to
be
followed,
but
also
upon
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
unless
the
state
could
show
that
the
waiver
to
attack
the
grand
jury
was
freely,
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made.
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
since
1902,
for
the
case
of
state
v.
peoples,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
held
that
a
defendant
who
cold
show
racial
exclusion
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
was
entitled
to
relief.
our
statutes
expressly
provide
that
the
method
of
grand
jury
selection
maybe
attacked.
that
attack
has
to
come
either
one,
prior
to
arraignment
or
two,
prior
to
swearing
in
of
the
petit
jury.
this
rule
is
quite
similar
to
the
rule
in
effect
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
true
your
honor,
it's
not
included.
i'll
be
quite
frank
with
you,
in
all
the
authorizations
of
guilty
pleas
that
i
have
ever
seen
prepared
by
counsel,
i
have
yet
to
see
counsel
include
that
particular
waiver.
usually,
it's
an
authorization
to
plead
guilty
that
the
defendant
understands
his
rights,
but
i
have
never
seen
that
specified.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
apparently
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
he
was
represented
by
privately
retained
counsel,
your
honor
and
apparently
privately
retained
counsel
was
doing
--
performing
for
his
client
the
best
services
that
he
thought
available
under
the
circumstances.
but
what
concerns
me
is
this.
our
statutes
provide
you
may
attack
the
grand
jury
selection.
the
federal
rules
provide
that
you
can
attack
grand
jury
selection
at
any
time
prior,
i
believe
similar
here
it
is
rule
12
(b)
(2).
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide
defenses
and
objections
based
on
defects
in
the
institution
of
the
prosecution
or
in
the
indictment
or
information
other
than
it
fails
to
show
jurisdiction
to
the
court
would
charge
an
offense
maybe
raise
only
by
motion
before
trial.
motion
shall
include
all
such
defenses
and
objections
then
available
to
defendant.
i
submit
that
in
either
a
trial
upon
a
plea
of
not
guilty
or
trial
upon
or
submission
of
a
guilty
plea
that
this
could
have
a
horrendous
effect
if
this
court
were
now
to
require
that
each
and
every
such
instance
that
the
waiver
be
on
the
record.
the
federal
system
had
blue
ribbon
grand
jury
selection.
not
only
of
what
we
are
talking
now
about
negro
defendants,
we're
talking
about
spanish-american
defendants,
we're
talking
about
puerto
rican
and
an
attack
could
be
made
in
the
federal
system,
if
collateral
attack
could
be
made
on
grand
jury
selection
on
behalf
of
every
indigent
white
defendant.
because
the
former
system
in
effect
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
former
blue
ribbon
system
of
grand
jury
selection
presented
a
middle
class
grand
jury.
the
indigents
were
not
on
that
grand
jury
and
so
i
submit
that
the
total
effect
here
would
permit
every
defendant
convicted
on
either
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty,
unless
somehow
an
express
waiver
could
be
shown
that
he
would
be
now
be
permitted
to
collaterally
attack
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
that
this
defendant
is
not
given
the
opportunity
to
choose
his
own
time
and
his
own
place
to
contest
his
guilt
now
that
the
evidence
is
in
most
instances
no
longer
available
now
that
the
witnesses
have
moved
or
they
forgotten,
now
that
many
instances
are
dead
and
the
evidence
has
been
destroyed.
i
submit
that
the
picture
presented
would
perhaps
completely
overburden
the
courts
of
all
the
states
and
of
the
federal
judiciary.
this
case
of
course
also
presents
the
jackson
issue
and
also
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
jackson
is
retroactive,
if
jackson
is
applicable.
there
are
at
the
present
time
according
to
my
research
either
eight
or
nine
states
which
have
possible
jackson
defects
if
this
court
should
rule
that
these
defects
do
exist.
in
the
federal
system
of
course
there's
a
federal
kidnapping
act,
the
federal
bank
rubbery
act,
there
is
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
minors,
the
atomic
secrets
act,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
there
is
the
rape
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
previously
held
in
bailey
versus
united
states
that
retroactivity
is
not
to
be
applied
in
the
rape
statue.
the
effect
once
again,
if
retroactivity
were
to
applied
regardless
of
the
argument
previously
presented
that
while
the
state
is
going
to
retry
them
after
all
some
of
these
defendants
have
served
a
great
deal
of
time
and
they
are
eligible
for
parole.
this
argument
i
think
denies
the
--
is
an
argument
of
expediency
in
that
regard
because
that
argument
says,
well,
there
are
a
great
number
of
men,
but
however
they'll
be
eligible
for
parole
and
good
number
them
on
attack.
i
can
advise
this
court
because
i
handle
habeas
corpus
everyday
of
the
week.
i
represent
the
state
in
the
federal
system
and
district
courts
that
the
floodgates
have
opened
up
that
petitions
are
coming
in
at
a
rate
is
unbelievable.
all
these
defendants
and
particularly
those
in
instances
where
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
or
coming
in,
i
was
coerced
to
plea
guilty
because
of
the
fear
of
death.
i
was
coerced
to
plead
guilty
because
of
the
statutory
scheme.
they
are
denying
the
fact
that
they
plead
guilty
because
at
the
time
of
their
trial,
the
state
had
overwhelming
proof
of
their
guilt,
but
now
they
are
coming
in
and
now
they
are
trying
to
choose
this
time
and
this
place
to
once
again
litigate.
now,
that
the
states
in
most
instances,
most
probably
cannot
successfully
be
prosecuted.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
that
would
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
of
course
your
honor
--
that
has
been
abolished
by
statute,
at
that
time
it
was
required
by
statute.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
now,
at
the
time
this
grand
jury
was
selected,
there
were
two
tax
lists,
one
for
white
and
one
for
negro.
the
tax
lists
--
however,
the
grand
jury
list
had
no
racial
designation
at
all.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
once
they
were
taken
from
the
list,
they
had
no
designation
and
i
believe
in
this
case
and
most
other
cases
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor,
in
this
case
at
the
post
conviction
hearing
conducted
by
mr.
smith
himself,
he
completely
failed
to
show
except
to
his
statistics
that
there
was
any
discrimination.
his
own
witness
refuted
that
contention.
his
own
witness
said
“this
is
the
procedure
that
was
used
and
--“
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
women?
yes,
your
honor,
we've
had
women
--
i
have
no
idea
how
far
back
but
we've
had
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
perhaps
to
this
one
county
because
it's
when
these
middle
poorer
counties
and
i
don't
think
they
had
restrooms
for
women
in
the
courthouse.
if
that's
the
situation
i
believe
that
perhaps
women
had
been
excluded
from
that
jury
because
they
didn't
have
restroom
facilities
for
the
women.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
perhaps
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
--just
because
that
the
--
just
the
commissioners
didn't
know
negroes
or
was
it
because
they
knew
negroes,
but
thought
they
were
incompetent?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
the
testimony
that
was
brought
out
was
that
the
same
criteria
was
used
in
selecting
white
prospective
grand
jurors
as
the
negro
grand
jurors,
that
the
criteria
used
was
the
criteria
of
the
north
carolina
statute.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
submit
this
that
the
commissioners
knew
more
white
people.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
the
criteria
was
equally
applied
and
i
submit
it's
similar
to
the
situation
formally
in
effect
in
the
federal
system.
the
blue
ribbon
type
of
jury
where
there
was
a
recommendation.
those
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course,
the
total
number
of
names
was
before
them
in
the
tax
list,
you
would
have
two
volumes
at
that
time,
one
white,
one
colored.
now,
of
course
our
statutes
have
been
amended
and
we
only
we
have
one
for
individuals
and
incorporations
and
additional
sources
have
been
added
by
statute.
the
voter
registration
list
and
other
items
it's
all
through
into
one
part
now
to
increase
the
listing.
of
course
this
is
the
tax
list,
people
who
have
listed
for
the
purpose
of
both
personal
property
taxation
and
ad
valorem
taxation.
so
i
would
submit
that
this
perhaps
is
another
basis
for
a
difference
that
perhaps
you
had
more
white
residents
of
the
county
with
property
who
listed
for
the
purpose
of
taxation.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i
believe
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
presentation
of
counsel's
facts.
admittedly,
approximately
four
nights
before
the
night
his
client
was
arrested,
this
particular
house
in
roanoke
rapids,
north
carolina
was
broken
into
and
the
female
occupant
raped.
as
a
result,
the
house
was
put
under
surveillance
and
it
occurred
to
approximately
11
pm
on
that
sunday
night.
and
now
at
approximately
11
pm
four
nights
later,
thursday
night
the
house
is
under
surveillance
and
the
youth
is
viewed
as
he
comes
upon
the
grounds
and
comes
to
the
door
at
that
point
he
is
arrested,
at
gun
point
of
course,
naturally.
he
was
then
brought
to
the
police
station,
it's
now
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
four
nights
later
when
he
comes
back
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
house
was
under
surveillance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
no
your
honor,
of
course
not.
he
was
brought
to
the
police
station
for
interrogation.
he
refused
to
tell
his
name,
refused
to
tell
where
he
was
from.
he
was
interrogated
for
approximately
two
hours.
he
was
put
in
a
cell
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening.
this
is
from
approximately
1:00
at
night
on,
but
they're
not
--
i
would
not
believe
that
the
cell
was
dimly
lit
or
not
lit
at
all
for
the
middle
of
the
night.
he
hadn't
told
the
police
officers
who
he
was
or
where
he'd
come
from.
the
police
officers
had
to
find
out
who
he
was
independently
and
having
determined
independently
who
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
approximately
3:30
or
4:30,
they
went
to
the
mother's
house
and
told
the
mother
that
her
son
was
in
custody.
and
if
they
said,
don't
bother
coming
now
or
whatever
they
might
have
said,
i
don't
know,
but
the
next
morning
at
sun
rise,
the
mother
was
on
the
door
steps
of
a
very
competent
law
firm
in
roanoke
rapids,
north
carolina
waiting
for
the
doors
to
open
up
and
as
soon
as
an
attorney
came
in,
she
employed
mr.
cranford.
almost
contemporaneously,
the
defendant
was
interrogated
again
early
that
morning,
this
is
before
counsel
was
employed
and
he
admitted
and
confessed
to
the
crime.
counsel
arrived
on
the
scene
having
been
hired
by
the
mother
just
a
few
minutes
after
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
cranford.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
this
was
privately
retained
counsel
george
o.
cranford
of
the
roanoke
rapids
bar.
he
arrived
and
he
asked
the
petitioner,
this
is
in
the
record
just
a
few
minutes
later,
was
he
scared
and
whether
the
attorney
questioned
petitioner
is
to
whether
when
he
made
the
confession
had
he
threatened
in
any
manner,
whether
any
promises
were
made
to
him
and
whether
he
was
scared
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement,
this
is
in
the
record.
petitioner
told
counsel
that
no
threats
or
promises
had
been
made
then
he
was
not
scared.
for
two
days
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
completely
undisputed
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
undisputed,
that's
on
page
67
of
the
appendix.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
or
when
the
case
was
on
the
docket
for
that
term
for
two
days
preceding
the
trial,
counsel
spent
these
two
days
with
petitioner
and
his
mother
and
a
written
authorization
was
prepared
as
required
by
north
carolina
law
upon
the
submission
of
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
case.
the
law
requires
that
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
capital
case
be
in
writing.
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
finally
retained
counsel,
mr.
cranford
after
these
two
days
that
he
spent
with
the
defendant
and
his
mother,
called
in
a
fellow
member
of
the
bar
to
witness
the
execution
of
the
authorization.
this
fellow
member
of
the
bar
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
in
his
own
right
interrogated
the
defendant
and
his
mother
at
the
time
the
defendant
signed
the
written
authorization,
this
is
in
the
record
too.
that's
in
the
appendix,
page
73,
charlie
d.
clark
jr.
attorney
at
law
in
roanoke
rapids
wanted
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
petitioner
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
the
consequences
of
his
act.
the
written
tender
of
the
plea
of
guilty
was
submitted
to
the
court.
it
was
accepted
by
the
solicitor
in
writing
and
was
accepted
by
the
judge.
the
court,
this
is
in
the
record,
interrogated
the
defendant
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea
and
the
court
also
interrogated
the
defendant's
mother
in
the
courtroom,
whereupon,
the
mandatory
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
was
imposed.
from
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
was
15,
your
honor.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
believe
a
discussion
is
necessary
upon
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
involuntary,
i
believe
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
and
of
course
the
jackson
defect,
we
have
previously
argued.
i'd
like
to
spend
some
time
on
this
question
of
grand
jury
discrimination.
mr.
smith
was
the
post
conviction
attorney.
he
represented
mr.
parker
at
the
post
conviction.
the
only
witness
put
on
the
stand
was
a
register
of
deeds
of
halifax
county
and
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
smith's
witness
or
mr.
wilson's
testimony,
it
was
apparent
that
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
that
the
--
then
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
was
that
the
names
for
the
grand
jury
were
selected
from
the
tax
rolls.
admittedly,
at
that
time,
there
were
tax
rolls
maintain
for
both
caucasian
and
white
--
excuse
me
caucasian
and
negro,
this
is
subsequently
been
changed
by
statute
and
no
longer
exist.
the
tax
rolls
had
to
prepare
that
way
but
the
names
in
the
jury
box
had
no
indication,
no
racial
discrimination.
the
testimony
presented
by
mr.
smith's
witness
show
that
the
jury
commissioners
came
from
different
parts
of
the
county,
selected
individuals
who
were
known
to
them
to
be
of
good
moral
character
that
the
same
criteria
were
applied
uniformly.
now,
i
submit
that
perhaps
what
we
get
to
in
this
instance
is
something
akin
to
the
former
blue
ribbon
grand
jury
selection
used
in
the
federal
district
courts.
there
is
no
deliberate
showing
of
racial
exclusion,
merely
a
showing
that
these
jury
commissioners
pick
up
people
known
to
them
to
be
a
good
moral
character.
perhaps
of
any
issue
confronting
this
court
today,
this
issue
could
perhaps
to
be
most
vital
because
it
is
counsel's
contention
here
that
unless
there
is
a
free,
voluntary
and
knowing
waiver
of
the
right
to
attack
the
grand
jury
that
that
attack
can
be
made
at
any
time.
so,
it
would
appear
that
not
only
upon
a
plea
of
guilty,
if
counsel's
arguments
were
to
be
followed,
but
also
upon
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
unless
the
state
could
show
that
the
waiver
to
attack
the
grand
jury
was
freely,
voluntarily
and
understandingly
made.
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
since
1902,
for
the
case
of
state
v.
peoples,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
held
that
a
defendant
who
cold
show
racial
exclusion
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
was
entitled
to
relief.
our
statutes
expressly
provide
that
the
method
of
grand
jury
selection
maybe
attacked.
that
attack
has
to
come
either
one,
prior
to
arraignment
or
two,
prior
to
swearing
in
of
the
petit
jury.
this
rule
is
quite
similar
to
the
rule
in
effect
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
true
your
honor,
it's
not
included.
i'll
be
quite
frank
with
you,
in
all
the
authorizations
of
guilty
pleas
that
i
have
ever
seen
prepared
by
counsel,
i
have
yet
to
see
counsel
include
that
particular
waiver.
usually,
it's
an
authorization
to
plead
guilty
that
the
defendant
understands
his
rights,
but
i
have
never
seen
that
specified.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
apparently
not.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
he
was
represented
by
privately
retained
counsel,
your
honor
and
apparently
privately
retained
counsel
was
doing
--
performing
for
his
client
the
best
services
that
he
thought
available
under
the
circumstances.
but
what
concerns
me
is
this.
our
statutes
provide
you
may
attack
the
grand
jury
selection.
the
federal
rules
provide
that
you
can
attack
grand
jury
selection
at
any
time
prior,
i
believe
similar
here
it
is
rule
12
(b)
(2).
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide
defenses
and
objections
based
on
defects
in
the
institution
of
the
prosecution
or
in
the
indictment
or
information
other
than
it
fails
to
show
jurisdiction
to
the
court
would
charge
an
offense
maybe
raise
only
by
motion
before
trial.
motion
shall
include
all
such
defenses
and
objections
then
available
to
defendant.
i
submit
that
in
either
a
trial
upon
a
plea
of
not
guilty
or
trial
upon
or
submission
of
a
guilty
plea
that
this
could
have
a
horrendous
effect
if
this
court
were
now
to
require
that
each
and
every
such
instance
that
the
waiver
be
on
the
record.
the
federal
system
had
blue
ribbon
grand
jury
selection.
not
only
of
what
we
are
talking
now
about
negro
defendants,
we're
talking
about
spanish-american
defendants,
we're
talking
about
puerto
rican
and
an
attack
could
be
made
in
the
federal
system,
if
collateral
attack
could
be
made
on
grand
jury
selection
on
behalf
of
every
indigent
white
defendant.
because
the
former
system
in
effect
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
former
blue
ribbon
system
of
grand
jury
selection
presented
a
middle
class
grand
jury.
the
indigents
were
not
on
that
grand
jury
and
so
i
submit
that
the
total
effect
here
would
permit
every
defendant
convicted
on
either
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty,
unless
somehow
an
express
waiver
could
be
shown
that
he
would
be
now
be
permitted
to
collaterally
attack
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
that
this
defendant
is
not
given
the
opportunity
to
choose
his
own
time
and
his
own
place
to
contest
his
guilt
now
that
the
evidence
is
in
most
instances
no
longer
available
now
that
the
witnesses
have
moved
or
they
forgotten,
now
that
many
instances
are
dead
and
the
evidence
has
been
destroyed.
i
submit
that
the
picture
presented
would
perhaps
completely
overburden
the
courts
of
all
the
states
and
of
the
federal
judiciary.
this
case
of
course
also
presents
the
jackson
issue
and
also
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
jackson
is
retroactive,
if
jackson
is
applicable.
there
are
at
the
present
time
according
to
my
research
either
eight
or
nine
states
which
have
possible
jackson
defects
if
this
court
should
rule
that
these
defects
do
exist.
in
the
federal
system
of
course
there's
a
federal
kidnapping
act,
the
federal
bank
rubbery
act,
there
is
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
minors,
the
atomic
secrets
act,
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
there
is
the
rape
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
previously
held
in
bailey
versus
united
states
that
retroactivity
is
not
to
be
applied
in
the
rape
statue.
the
effect
once
again,
if
retroactivity
were
to
applied
regardless
of
the
argument
previously
presented
that
while
the
state
is
going
to
retry
them
after
all
some
of
these
defendants
have
served
a
great
deal
of
time
and
they
are
eligible
for
parole.
this
argument
i
think
denies
the
--
is
an
argument
of
expediency
in
that
regard
because
that
argument
says,
well,
there
are
a
great
number
of
men,
but
however
they'll
be
eligible
for
parole
and
good
number
them
on
attack.
i
can
advise
this
court
because
i
handle
habeas
corpus
everyday
of
the
week.
i
represent
the
state
in
the
federal
system
and
district
courts
that
the
floodgates
have
opened
up
that
petitions
are
coming
in
at
a
rate
is
unbelievable.
all
these
defendants
and
particularly
those
in
instances
where
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
or
coming
in,
i
was
coerced
to
plea
guilty
because
of
the
fear
of
death.
i
was
coerced
to
plead
guilty
because
of
the
statutory
scheme.
they
are
denying
the
fact
that
they
plead
guilty
because
at
the
time
of
their
trial,
the
state
had
overwhelming
proof
of
their
guilt,
but
now
they
are
coming
in
and
now
they
are
trying
to
choose
this
time
and
this
place
to
once
again
litigate.
now,
that
the
states
in
most
instances,
most
probably
cannot
successfully
be
prosecuted.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
that
would
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
of
course
your
honor
--
that
has
been
abolished
by
statute,
at
that
time
it
was
required
by
statute.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
now,
at
the
time
this
grand
jury
was
selected,
there
were
two
tax
lists,
one
for
white
and
one
for
negro.
the
tax
lists
--
however,
the
grand
jury
list
had
no
racial
designation
at
all.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
once
they
were
taken
from
the
list,
they
had
no
designation
and
i
believe
in
this
case
and
most
other
cases
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor,
in
this
case
at
the
post
conviction
hearing
conducted
by
mr.
smith
himself,
he
completely
failed
to
show
except
to
his
statistics
that
there
was
any
discrimination.
his
own
witness
refuted
that
contention.
his
own
witness
said
“this
is
the
procedure
that
was
used
and
--“
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
women?
yes,
your
honor,
we've
had
women
--
i
have
no
idea
how
far
back
but
we've
had
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh!
perhaps
to
this
one
county
because
it's
when
these
middle
poorer
counties
and
i
don't
think
they
had
restrooms
for
women
in
the
courthouse.
if
that's
the
situation
i
believe
that
perhaps
women
had
been
excluded
from
that
jury
because
they
didn't
have
restroom
facilities
for
the
women.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
perhaps
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
--just
because
that
the
--
just
the
commissioners
didn't
know
negroes
or
was
it
because
they
knew
negroes,
but
thought
they
were
incompetent?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
the
testimony
that
was
brought
out
was
that
the
same
criteria
was
used
in
selecting
white
prospective
grand
jurors
as
the
negro
grand
jurors,
that
the
criteria
used
was
the
criteria
of
the
north
carolina
statute.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
would
submit
this
that
the
commissioners
knew
more
white
people.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
the
criteria
was
equally
applied
and
i
submit
it's
similar
to
the
situation
formally
in
effect
in
the
federal
system.
the
blue
ribbon
type
of
jury
where
there
was
a
recommendation.
those
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course,
the
total
number
of
names
was
before
them
in
the
tax
list,
you
would
have
two
volumes
at
that
time,
one
white,
one
colored.
now,
of
course
our
statutes
have
been
amended
and
we
only
we
have
one
for
individuals
and
incorporations
and
additional
sources
have
been
added
by
statute.
the
voter
registration
list
and
other
items
it's
all
through
into
one
part
now
to
increase
the
listing.
of
course
this
is
the
tax
list,
people
who
have
listed
for
the
purpose
of
both
personal
property
taxation
and
ad
valorem
taxation.
so
i
would
submit
that
this
perhaps
is
another
basis
for
a
difference
that
perhaps
you
had
more
white
residents
of
the
county
with
property
who
listed
for
