mr.
norman
b.
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
norman
smith,
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
this
is
a
companion
case
to
the
albert
case
and
it
again
has
to
do
with
our
north
carolina
statutory
system
on
the
rendering
of
guilty
pleas
in
capital
cases.
this
proceeding
is
by
habeas
--
was
by
our
statutory
substitute
for
habeas
corpus
in
north
carolina,
our
statutory
post
conviction
hearing
act.
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
an
adverse
determination
there
to
our
court
of
appeals
in
north
carolina
which
is
our
intermediate
appellate
court
for
most
matters,
but
which
is
a
court
of
final
appellate
jurisdiction
for
post
conviction
matters.
again,
there
was
an
adverse
determination
and
again
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
filed
in
this
court,
which
of
course
was
granted.
this
case
has
its
beginnings
in
1964,
in
the
summer
of
1964
the
petitioner
who
was
then
a
15-year-old
child
was
arrested
by
police
at
gun
point
about
11:00
one
night
in
the
city
of
roanoke
rapids
in
north
carolina
and
he
was
taken
to
an
interrogation
cell
and
there
he
was
interrogated
for
a
time.
he
at
first
was
extremely
uncooperative,
indeed
refused
to
give
his
name
and
address.
however,
he
apparently
from
some
source
knew
that
it
was
good
idea
to
ask
for
counsel
under
these
circumstances
and
the
record
indicates
without
any
impeachment
or
contradiction
that
he
did
request
that
a
counsel
be
provided
for
him.
the
police
securing
no
fruits
from
their
labors
of
interrogation
on
the
initial
interview
placed
him
in
a
dimly
lit
or
unlighted
cell
for
the
night
in
which
there
was
no
water
available
to
him
nor
no
food
given
to
him.
he
was
held
over
night
and
next
morning
he
was
again
interrogated,
this
time
he
broke
down
rather
quickly
and
did
render
a
statement
to
the
police,
an
oral
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
had
gone
into
the
house
in
question
and
that
he
had
committed
some
form
of
house
breaking
or
that
he
had
gotten
through
the
door
and
some
manner.
the
precise
detail
of
this
statement
or
confession
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
at
any
point
along
the
way
and
i
might
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
here
on
this
point
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
superior
court
at
the
time
the
guilty
plea
was
rendered
in
this
case.
that
is
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
no
--
none
of
the
state's
testimony
was
given
insofar
as
the
record
indicates
and
i'm
not
personally
aware
that
there
was
one.
there
was
some
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
varies
by
the
--
most
of
operation
of
individual
solicitors
and
judge,
there
is
as
far
as
i
know
no
statutory
compulsion
that
this
be
done.
some
judges
in
the
exercise
of
care
like
to
have
--
always
have
something
on
this
order.
i
think
defendants
quite
clearly
at
this
time
also
were
permitted
to
make
statements
and
to
present
evidence
if
they
wished
to
do
so.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
there
is
no
attention
to
the
rules
of
evidence
during
such
hearings.
the
defendants
are
permitted
to
get
up
and
through
counsel
or
give
all
sorts
of
unsworn
testimonies
to
what
kind
of
good
character
they
have
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
true,
i
think
some
of
our
judges
except
the
philosophy
of
rule
11
to
the
effect
that
there
should
always
be
basis
in
fact
for
the
plea
and
then
also
of
course
it
must
be
knowingly
and
voluntarily
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
record
does
indicate
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
there
was
some
colloquially
between
the
court
and
the
defendant
and
between
the
court
and
defendant's
mother
in
which
the
court
did
inquire
in
the
certain
circumstances
of
defendant,
his
age,
his
educational
background.
we're
shown
friends
and
said
he
had
unsuccessfully
been
enrolled
in
the
ninth
grade,
i
think
the
year
prior.
this
was
--
i
think
the
record
does
indicate
that
this
case
had
extreme
racial
aspects
to
it,
the
[voice
overlaps]
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
sorry,
no
this
was
under
our
old
rule
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
and
it
was
a
mandatory
life
sentence,
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right
sir.
this
was
charged
a
first
degree
burglary.
there
was
no
indication
that
any
other
charges
were
being
considered
at
that
time.
although,
there
is
a
gratuitous
finding
by
the
judge,
who
heard
the
post
conviction
case
that
he
shouldn't
been
charged
with
rape
as
well.
incidentally,
the
state
has
made
the
point
in
its
brief
and
i
think
if
i
may
say
so
quite
inappropriately
that
there
was
an
admission
of
guilt
by
the
defendant
in
the
post
conviction
hearing
that
he
fully
admitted
his
guilt
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
indicates
that
the
defendant
did
not
admit
guilt
of
either
rape
or
burglary.
he
did
admit
that
entered
this
house
that
he
had
relations
with
the
woman
who
was
there,
but
he
was
arrested
as
the
record
indicates
on
the
very
doorstep
of
the
same
house
four
nights
later
and
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
strong
element
of
consent
or
implied
consent
or
some
sort
of
an
arrangement
which
is
hidden
by
background
and
has
not
been
disclosed
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
hope
that
there
will
be
new
trial
in
this
case
and
i
hope
that
at
the
new
trial,
the
defendant
will
have
fair
and
full
right
to
bring
all
these
matters
out
to
the
attention
of
the
triers
of
fact.
also,
some
further
brief
background
material
on
the
defendant;
there
is
a
psychiatric
evaluation
of
the
petitioner
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
is
an
inhibitive
and
impulsive
individual
and
this
likely
to
act
in
such
ways
to
secure
his
immediate
goals.
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
immediate
goal
of
the
defendant
and
the
overwhelming
goal
that
loomed
in
front
of
him
was
the
avoidance
of
capital
punishment
because
of
the
strong
racial
connections
which
this
case
had
in
the
times
and
spirit
of
the
times
in
which
the
case
was
heard
or
brought
up
and
we
think
that
the
record
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
fact
of
this
present.
the
whole
theoretical
basis
for
the
jackson
case
as
i
understand
it
is
this
compulsion
or
this
tendency
to
coerce
people
to
render
involuntary
pleas
for
them
to
give
up
their
rights
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty,
the
right
to
have
a
full
trial.
i
realize
the
course
of
the
actual
facts
of
the
jackson
case
and
precise
holding
of
the
jackson
case
go
off
in
a
different
direction
as
the
court
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
in
this
raised
argument,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
theoretical
basis
for
the
jackson
case
is
to
provide
some
protection
for
a
person
found
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
say
that
the
evidence
on
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
substantial
coercion
present.
we
say
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
a
test
formulated
by
the
court
in
this
case
to
determine
when
and
when
not
to
extend
jackson
protection
to
an
individual.
we
fully
and
candidly
recognize
that
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
carve
out
a
per
se
rule
and
to
say
that
every
guilty
plea
to
every
capital
offense
heretofore
in
one
of
those
states
or
the
federal
jurisdiction
where
a
jackson
type
statute
obtained
must
be
now
set
aside.
we
do
say
however
that
some
sort
of
test
must
be
devised
by
the
court
to
decide
when
and
when
not
to
set
aside
these
judgments
and
convictions.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
your
honor
of
course
the
facts
of
my
case
do
not
involve
a
lesser
offense,
but
i
realize
that
the
court
does
have
that
problem
in
the
series
of
cases.
my
client
here
pleaded
to
the
capital
offense.
i
would
say,
i've
discussed
this
point
in
a
footnote
in
the
brief.
i
suggested
that
where
the
lesser
included
offense
carries
a
sentence
so
large
that
it
is
tantamount
to
life
imprisonment
that
then
the
matter
should
be
considered
on
a
parity
with
a
guilty
plea
carrying
life
imprisonment
itself.
and
thus
i
suppose
this
rule
would
extend
to
mrs.
bray's
case.
i
don't
know
where
the
stopping
point
is
your
honor.
like
this
case
as
in
many
other
cases
the
stopping
point
some
where
must
be
arbitrary
and
where
this
court
will
place
it
or
should
place
it,
i
cannot
say.
i
do
say
however
that
my
client
falls
within
the
boundary
and
within
the
limit
for
which
we
contend
here.
i
would
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
to
the
offense
which
ordinarily
would
be
capital,
were
it
not
for
the
entering
of
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
of
course
this
court
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
finding
such
as
stopping
place,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
where
it
would
be.
i
suggest
it
as
i
say
in
the
footnote
that
maybe
the
stopping
point
would
be
where
you
get
a
sentence
which
is
tantamount
to
life
imprisonment
such
as
henry
alfrod's
30-year
sentence
although
that's
not
in
my
case
and
i
really
unable
to
say
with
certainty.
i
would
think
that
the
test
--
that
the
court
should
invoke
in
these
cases
is
something
like
a
test
devise
in
chapman
versus
california,
carrying
forward
the
realization
that
in
not
every
case
would
the
guilty
plea
be
set
aside,
but
only
in
those
cases
where
the
evidence
made
some
showing
that
the
fear
of
the
death
house,
the
fear
of
the
gas
chamber
had
an
effect,
substantial
effect.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
i
think
one
would
have
to
say
substantial
influence.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
it
probably
could
be
otherwise.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor
i
certainly
am
not
attacking
idea
of
allowing
guilty
pleas.
i
think
you
get
into
a
quagmire
when
you
have
a
disparity
in
sentencing,
one
involving
life
and
the
other
involving
death
when
you
base
a
guilty
plea
on
that
distinction.
fortunately
not
every
state
is
gotten
into
that
quagmire.
there
are
only
some
eight
states
and
the
federal
jurisdiction
indicating
from
footnotes
contained
in
our
brief
and
also
footnotes
or
portions
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund.
also,
on
the
basis
of
some
rather
sketchy
statistics
which
i've
gathered
in
the
brief
and
which
are
on
file
with
the
court,
it's
indicated
that
perhaps
the
total
number
of
prisoners
who
would
be
affected
by
a
favorable
decision
for
my
client
in
this
case
would
not
be
an
overwhelming
number
in
that
a
great
number
of
prisoners
who've
served
out
almost
as
many
years
as
the
average
prisoner
normally
serves
of
the
life
sentence
before
dying
or
being
paroled
or
in
somehow
the
way
terminating
the
service.
and
that
also
we're
not
contending
for
a
per
se
rule
but
we
would
only
provide
new
trials
for
those
persons
who
could
show
in
some
way
that
the
guilty
--
that
the
fear
of
the
gas
chamber
contributed
substantially
to
the
guilty
plea
so
that
the
floodgate
argument
may
not
be
as
persuasive
in
this
case
as
it
would
appear
on
the
first
blush.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
he's
been
denied
relief
all
along
the
way
and
he
is
serving
his
life
sentence.
also,
in
the
present
case,
we
feel
that
when
you
take
the
statutory
construction
together
with
the
coerced
confession
which
was
obtained
from
the
petitioner
that
these
together
make
a
rather
potent
showing
of
an
invalidity
of
the
guilty
plea.
the
confession
was
clearly
in
violation
of
the
escobedo
rule.
it
was
subsequent
to
the
pronouncement
of
the
escobedo
case
and
also
we
feel
that
the
confession
violated
the
principles
declared
by
this
court
in
gallagos
versus
colorado.
considering
the
youth,
the
educational
limitation
as
a
physiological
deficit
of
the
prisoner,
the
fact
that
the
prisoner's
mother
was
kept
from
seeing
him
during
the
night
in
which
the
confession
was
obtained,
his
isolation
and
the
denial
of
drinking
water
and
other
matters
which
are
brought
out
in
the
record
and
which
are
not
overcome
by
any
adverse
evidence.
even
giving
the
state
the
benefit
of
always
favorable
testimony
we
feel
quite
clearly
that
under
constitutional
standards
as
shown
by
this
court,
there
was
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh!
we
think
the
two
go
forward
together
and
both
taint
the
plea.
we
feel
that
this
coerced
confession
adds
weight
to
the
jackson
type
infirmity
that
was
present
in
this
case.
how
far
the
court
should
go
in
allowing
new
trials
when
there
is
a
jackson
defect
in
the
statutes,
i
don't
know.
i
would
suggest
though
that
because
of
this
additional
problem
relating
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
the
court
would
be
justified
certainly
in
setting
this
guilty
plea
aside.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
we
have
another
aspect
to
this
case
i
want
to
bring
briefly
to
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
that
is
a
completely
unrelated
matter,
but
certiorari
was
just
generally
granted
in
this
case
so
i
assume
that
the
court
is
interested
in
it.
and
this
was
the
point
concerning
the
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
petitioner,
of
course
he
never
came
to
trial,
so
the
trial
jury
is
not
in
question
here.
quite
clearly
the
statistics
in
this
case
show
that
the
petitioner
comes
within
that
long
line
of
cases
decided
by
the
court
on
the
permissible
limits
of
racial
exclusion
of
grand
jurors
providing
he
did
not
waive
his
right
to
attack
this
jurisdictional
defect
of
the
court.
evidence
shows
that
seven-and-a-half
percent
of
the
jurors
served
on
grand
juries
for
the
preceding
four
years
that
the
negro,
five-and-a-half
percent
of
those
who
served
on
the
particular
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
were
negro.
only
4.4%
of
the
jurors
who
had
served
for
four
years
on
all
jury
venires
are
were
negro,
whereas
the
total
population,
the
total
adult
population
of
county
was
45%
negro
and
the
tax
payers
of
the
county
were
39%.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
the
problem
your
honor,
i
think
were
faced
with
here.
we
have
a
conflict
of
authority
prevailing
in
our
part
of
the
country
and
we're
depending
on
this
court
to
clear
it
up.
the
fourth
circuit,
under
the
case
of
mcneil
versus
north
carolina
and
i
might
add
the
fifth
circuit
under
the
case
of
cobb
versus
balcombe
and
others
has
determined
that
there
can
be
no
waiver
of
such
a
constitutional
jurisdictional
defect
to
the
court
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
an
intentional,
knowing
waiver
living
up
to
the
full
requirement
of
carnley
v.
cochran
and
fay
v.
noia
and
the
other
waiver
cases
that
this
court
has
determined.
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina
on
the
other
hand
says
he's
represented
by
counsel,
counsel
is
presumptively
competent.
even
though
this
matter
was
not
discussed
between
petitioners
and
his
counsel
nor
even
brought
up
by
the
counsel
or
was
it
in
any
way
brought
to
anyone's
attention
by
the
court,
but
he
nevertheless
is
deemed
to
waive
it.
we
say
there
cannot
be
a
valid
waiver
when
it
takes
place
in
a
vacuum,
when
it
takes
place
in
the
midst
of
ignorance
and
lack
of
information,
lack
of
discussion
so
forth.
this
court
quite
clearly
has
stated
that
waiver
is
a
personal
decision
which
must
be
arrived
at
by
the
defendant
himself.
in
consultation
with
counsel
he
must
have
all
of
the
facts
at
his
disposal
and
that
he
must
himself
participate
in
the
decision.
applying
these
principles
to
a
similar
case,
the
fourth
circuit
and
mcneil
versus
north
carolina
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
cobb
v.
balcombe
have
come
to
me
what
is
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
a
waiver
of
constitutional
nature
must
be
established.
here,
there
is
utterly
an
absence
of
evidence
on
this
point
that
would
favor
the
state
and
all
the
evidence
clearly
is
in
the
petitioner's
favor
and
that
there
was
no
discussion
and
consideration
of
it
and
we
feel
that
constitution
here
compels
a
retrial
on
that
ground.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
should
think
the
state
would
have
to
bring
a
new
indictment
against
the
petitioner
and
would
have
try
him
anew.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
he
probably
could
plead
guilty
if
he
chose
to
do
so
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
i
were
his
lawyer
i
wouldn't
advise
him
to
plead
guilty
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
i
advise
not
guilty
plea.
some
of
the
persons
of
his
own
race
now
a
days
in
north
carolina
would
be
on
his
jury.
i
think
he'd
have
a
fair
shake
and
i'd
be
quite
willing
to
try
this
case
on
a
not
guilty
plea
and
quite
willing
to
bring
it
up
here
again
if
constitutional
defects
came
in
the
trial
which
i
hope
and
pray
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
he
fully
understands
that
because
i
explained
this
to
a
very
throughly
before
the
post
conviction
proceeding
was
commenced
whether,
a
point
ms.
bray
discussed
is
whether
one
once
having
received
life
can
be
put
at
risk
of
death
again
under
these
double
jeopardy
cases
as
i
suppose
at
issue
here.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
not
--
he
could
not
plea
guilty
to
burglary
or
rape
because
you
can
no
longer
do
so
in
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right.
well,
i
believe
i
have
nothing
further
except
to
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
argument
and
praying
once
again
that
the
relief
request
be
granted.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
norman
smith,
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
this
is
a
companion
case
to
the
albert
case
and
it
again
has
to
do
with
our
north
carolina
statutory
system
on
the
rendering
of
guilty
pleas
in
capital
cases.
this
proceeding
is
by
habeas
--
was
by
our
statutory
substitute
for
habeas
corpus
in
north
carolina,
our
statutory
post
conviction
hearing
act.
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
an
adverse
determination
there
to
our
court
of
appeals
in
north
carolina
which
is
our
intermediate
appellate
court
for
most
matters,
but
which
is
a
court
of
final
appellate
jurisdiction
for
post
conviction
matters.
again,
there
was
an
adverse
determination
and
again
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
filed
in
this
court,
which
of
course
was
granted.
this
case
has
its
beginnings
in
1964,
in
the
summer
of
1964
the
petitioner
who
was
then
a
15-year-old
child
was
arrested
by
police
at
gun
point
about
11:00
one
night
in
the
city
of
roanoke
rapids
in
north
carolina
and
he
was
taken
to
an
interrogation
cell
and
there
he
was
interrogated
for
a
time.
he
at
first
was
extremely
uncooperative,
indeed
refused
to
give
his
name
and
address.
however,
he
apparently
from
some
source
knew
that
it
was
good
idea
to
ask
for
counsel
under
these
circumstances
and
the
record
indicates
without
any
impeachment
or
contradiction
that
he
did
request
that
a
counsel
be
provided
for
him.
the
police
securing
no
fruits
from
their
labors
of
interrogation
on
the
initial
interview
placed
him
in
a
dimly
lit
or
unlighted
cell
for
the
night
in
which
there
was
no
water
available
to
him
nor
no
food
given
to
him.
he
was
held
over
night
and
next
morning
he
was
again
interrogated,
this
time
he
broke
down
rather
quickly
and
did
render
a
statement
to
the
police,
an
oral
statement
to
the
effect
that
he
had
gone
into
the
house
in
question
and
that
he
had
committed
some
form
of
house
breaking
or
that
he
had
gotten
through
the
door
and
some
manner.
the
precise
detail
of
this
statement
or
confession
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
at
any
point
along
the
way
and
i
might
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
here
on
this
point
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
superior
court
at
the
time
the
guilty
plea
was
rendered
in
this
case.
that
is
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing,
no
--
none
of
the
state's
testimony
was
given
insofar
as
the
record
indicates
and
i'm
not
personally
aware
that
there
was
one.
there
was
some
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
varies
by
the
--
most
of
operation
of
individual
solicitors
and
judge,
there
is
as
far
as
i
know
no
statutory
compulsion
that
this
be
done.
some
judges
in
the
exercise
of
care
like
to
have
--
always
have
something
on
this
order.
i
think
defendants
quite
clearly
at
this
time
also
were
permitted
to
make
statements
and
to
present
evidence
if
they
wished
to
do
so.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
there
is
no
attention
to
the
rules
of
evidence
during
such
hearings.
the
defendants
are
permitted
to
get
up
and
through
counsel
or
give
all
sorts
of
unsworn
testimonies
to
what
kind
of
good
character
they
have
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
true,
i
think
some
of
our
judges
except
the
philosophy
of
rule
11
to
the
effect
that
there
should
always
be
basis
in
fact
for
the
plea
and
then
also
of
course
it
must
be
knowingly
and
voluntarily
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
record
does
indicate
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
there
was
some
colloquially
between
the
court
and
the
defendant
and
between
the
court
and
defendant's
mother
in
which
the
court
did
inquire
in
the
certain
circumstances
of
defendant,
his
age,
his
educational
background.
we're
shown
friends
and
said
he
had
unsuccessfully
been
enrolled
in
the
ninth
grade,
i
think
the
year
prior.
this
was
--
i
think
the
record
does
indicate
that
this
case
had
extreme
racial
aspects
to
it,
the
[voice
overlaps]
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
sorry,
no
this
was
under
our
old
rule
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
and
it
was
a
mandatory
life
sentence,
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right
sir.
this
was
charged
a
first
degree
burglary.
there
was
no
indication
that
any
other
charges
were
being
considered
at
that
time.
although,
there
is
a
gratuitous
finding
by
the
judge,
who
heard
the
post
conviction
case
that
he
shouldn't
been
charged
with
rape
as
well.
incidentally,
the
state
has
made
the
point
in
its
brief
and
i
think
if
i
may
say
so
quite
inappropriately
that
there
was
an
admission
of
guilt
by
the
defendant
in
the
post
conviction
hearing
that
he
fully
admitted
his
guilt
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
indicates
that
the
defendant
did
not
admit
guilt
of
either
rape
or
burglary.
he
did
admit
that
entered
this
house
that
he
had
relations
with
the
woman
who
was
there,
but
he
was
arrested
as
the
record
indicates
on
the
very
doorstep
of
the
same
house
four
nights
later
and
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
strong
element
of
consent
or
implied
consent
or
some
sort
of
an
arrangement
which
is
hidden
by
background
and
has
not
been
disclosed
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
hope
that
there
will
be
new
trial
in
this
case
and
i
hope
that
at
the
new
trial,
the
defendant
will
have
fair
and
full
right
to
bring
all
these
matters
out
to
the
attention
of
the
triers
of
fact.
also,
some
further
brief
background
material
on
the
defendant;
there
is
a
psychiatric
evaluation
of
the
petitioner
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
is
an
inhibitive
and
impulsive
individual
and
this
likely
to
act
in
such
ways
to
secure
his
immediate
goals.
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
immediate
goal
of
the
defendant
and
the
overwhelming
goal
that
loomed
in
front
of
him
was
the
avoidance
of
capital
punishment
because
of
the
strong
racial
connections
which
this
case
had
in
the
times
and
spirit
of
the
times
in
which
the
case
was
heard
or
brought
up
and
we
think
that
the
record
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
very
substantial
fact
of
this
present.
the
whole
theoretical
basis
for
the
jackson
case
as
i
understand
it
is
this
compulsion
or
this
tendency
to
coerce
people
to
render
involuntary
pleas
for
them
to
give
up
their
rights
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty,
the
right
to
have
a
full
trial.
i
realize
the
course
of
the
actual
facts
of
the
jackson
case
and
precise
holding
of
the
jackson
case
go
off
in
a
different
direction
as
the
court
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
in
this
raised
argument,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
theoretical
basis
for
the
jackson
case
is
to
provide
some
protection
for
a
person
found
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
say
that
the
evidence
on
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
substantial
coercion
present.
we
say
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
a
test
formulated
by
the
court
in
this
case
to
determine
when
and
when
not
to
extend
jackson
protection
to
an
individual.
we
fully
and
candidly
recognize
that
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
carve
out
a
per
se
rule
and
to
say
that
every
guilty
plea
to
every
capital
offense
heretofore
in
one
of
those
states
or
the
federal
jurisdiction
where
a
jackson
type
statute
obtained
must
be
now
set
aside.
we
do
say
however
that
some
sort
of
test
must
be
devised
by
the
court
to
decide
when
and
when
not
to
set
aside
these
judgments
and
convictions.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
your
honor
of
course
the
facts
of
my
case
do
not
involve
a
lesser
offense,
but
i
realize
that
the
court
does
have
that
problem
in
the
series
of
cases.
my
client
here
pleaded
to
the
capital
offense.
i
would
say,
i've
discussed
this
point
in
a
footnote
in
the
brief.
i
suggested
that
where
the
lesser
included
offense
carries
a
sentence
so
large
that
it
is
tantamount
to
life
imprisonment
that
then
the
matter
should
be
considered
on
a
parity
with
a
guilty
plea
carrying
life
imprisonment
itself.
and
thus
i
suppose
this
rule
would
extend
to
mrs.
bray's
case.
i
don't
know
where
the
stopping
point
is
your
honor.
like
this
case
as
in
many
other
cases
the
stopping
point
some
where
must
be
arbitrary
and
where
this
court
will
place
it
or
should
place
it,
i
cannot
say.
i
do
say
however
that
my
client
falls
within
the
boundary
and
within
the
limit
for
which
we
contend
here.
i
would
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
to
the
offense
which
ordinarily
would
be
capital,
were
it
not
for
the
entering
of
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
of
course
this
court
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
finding
such
as
stopping
place,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
where
it
would
be.
i
suggest
it
as
i
say
in
the
footnote
that
maybe
the
stopping
point
would
be
where
you
get
a
sentence
which
is
tantamount
to
life
imprisonment
such
as
henry
alfrod's
30-year
sentence
although
that's
not
in
my
case
and
i
really
unable
to
say
with
certainty.
i
would
think
that
the
test
--
that
the
court
should
invoke
in
these
cases
is
something
like
a
test
devise
in
chapman
versus
california,
carrying
forward
the
realization
that
in
not
every
case
would
the
guilty
plea
be
set
aside,
but
only
in
those
cases
where
the
evidence
made
some
showing
that
the
fear
of
the
death
house,
the
fear
of
the
gas
chamber
had
an
effect,
substantial
effect.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
i
think
one
would
have
to
say
substantial
influence.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
it
probably
could
be
otherwise.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor
i
certainly
am
not
attacking
idea
of
allowing
guilty
pleas.
i
think
you
get
into
a
quagmire
when
you
have
a
disparity
in
sentencing,
one
involving
life
and
the
other
involving
death
when
you
base
a
guilty
plea
on
that
distinction.
fortunately
not
every
state
is
gotten
into
that
quagmire.
there
are
only
some
eight
states
and
the
federal
jurisdiction
indicating
from
footnotes
contained
in
our
brief
and
also
footnotes
or
portions
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund.
also,
on
the
basis
of
some
rather
sketchy
statistics
which
i've
gathered
in
the
brief
and
which
are
on
file
with
the
court,
it's
indicated
that
perhaps
the
total
number
of
prisoners
who
would
be
affected
by
a
favorable
decision
for
my
client
in
this
case
would
not
be
an
overwhelming
number
in
that
a
great
number
of
prisoners
who've
served
out
almost
as
many
years
as
the
average
prisoner
normally
serves
of
the
life
sentence
before
dying
or
being
paroled
or
in
somehow
the
way
terminating
the
service.
and
that
also
we're
not
contending
for
a
per
se
rule
but
we
would
only
provide
new
trials
for
those
persons
who
could
show
in
some
way
that
the
guilty
--
that
the
fear
of
the
gas
chamber
contributed
substantially
to
the
guilty
plea
so
that
the
floodgate
argument
may
not
be
as
persuasive
in
this
case
as
it
would
appear
on
the
first
blush.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
he's
been
denied
relief
all
along
the
way
and
he
is
serving
his
life
sentence.
also,
in
the
present
case,
we
feel
that
when
you
take
the
statutory
construction
together
with
the
coerced
confession
which
was
obtained
from
the
petitioner
that
these
together
make
a
rather
potent
showing
of
an
invalidity
of
the
guilty
plea.
the
confession
was
clearly
in
violation
of
the
escobedo
rule.
it
was
subsequent
to
the
pronouncement
of
the
escobedo
case
and
also
we
feel
that
the
confession
violated
the
principles
declared
by
this
court
in
gallagos
versus
colorado.
considering
the
youth,
the
educational
limitation
as
a
physiological
deficit
of
the
prisoner,
the
fact
that
the
prisoner's
mother
was
kept
from
seeing
him
during
the
night
in
which
the
confession
was
obtained,
his
isolation
and
the
denial
of
drinking
water
and
other
matters
which
are
brought
out
in
the
record
and
which
are
not
overcome
by
any
adverse
evidence.
even
giving
the
state
the
benefit
of
always
favorable
testimony
we
feel
quite
clearly
that
under
constitutional
standards
as
shown
by
this
court,
there
was
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh!
we
think
the
two
go
forward
together
and
both
taint
the
plea.
we
feel
that
this
coerced
confession
adds
weight
to
the
jackson
type
infirmity
that
was
present
in
this
case.
how
far
the
court
should
go
in
allowing
new
trials
when
there
is
a
jackson
defect
in
the
statutes,
i
don't
know.
i
would
suggest
though
that
because
of
this
additional
problem
relating
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
the
court
would
be
justified
certainly
in
setting
this
guilty
plea
aside.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
we
have
another
aspect
to
this
case
i
want
to
bring
briefly
to
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
that
is
a
completely
unrelated
matter,
but
certiorari
was
just
generally
granted
in
this
case
so
i
assume
that
the
court
is
interested
in
it.
and
this
was
the
point
concerning
the
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
petitioner,
of
course
he
never
came
to
trial,
so
the
trial
jury
is
not
in
question
here.
quite
clearly
the
statistics
in
this
case
show
that
the
petitioner
comes
within
that
long
line
of
cases
decided
by
the
court
on
the
permissible
limits
of
racial
exclusion
of
grand
jurors
providing
he
did
not
waive
his
right
to
attack
this
jurisdictional
defect
of
the
court.
evidence
shows
that
seven-and-a-half
percent
of
the
jurors
served
on
grand
juries
for
the
preceding
four
years
that
the
negro,
five-and-a-half
percent
of
those
who
served
on
the
particular
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
were
negro.
only
4.4%
of
the
jurors
who
had
served
for
four
years
on
all
jury
venires
are
were
negro,
whereas
the
total
population,
the
total
adult
population
of
county
was
45%
negro
and
the
tax
payers
of
the
county
were
39%.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
the
problem
your
honor,
i
think
were
faced
with
here.
we
have
a
conflict
of
authority
prevailing
in
our
part
of
the
country
and
we're
depending
on
this
court
to
clear
it
up.
the
fourth
circuit,
under
the
case
of
mcneil
versus
north
carolina
and
i
might
add
the
fifth
circuit
under
the
case
of
cobb
versus
balcombe
and
others
has
determined
that
there
can
be
no
waiver
of
such
a
constitutional
jurisdictional
defect
to
the
court
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
an
intentional,
knowing
waiver
living
up
to
the
full
requirement
of
carnley
v.
cochran
and
fay
v.
noia
and
the
other
waiver
cases
that
this
court
has
determined.
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina
on
the
other
hand
says
he's
represented
by
counsel,
counsel
is
presumptively
competent.
even
though
this
matter
was
not
discussed
between
petitioners
and
his
counsel
nor
even
brought
up
by
the
counsel
or
was
it
in
any
way
brought
to
anyone's
attention
by
the
court,
but
he
nevertheless
is
deemed
to
waive
it.
we
say
there
cannot
be
a
valid
waiver
when
it
takes
place
in
a
vacuum,
when
it
takes
place
in
the
midst
of
ignorance
and
lack
of
information,
lack
of
discussion
so
forth.
this
court
quite
clearly
has
stated
that
waiver
is
a
personal
decision
which
must
be
arrived
at
by
the
defendant
himself.
in
consultation
with
counsel
he
must
have
all
of
the
facts
at
his
disposal
and
that
he
must
himself
participate
in
the
decision.
applying
these
principles
to
a
similar
case,
the
fourth
circuit
and
mcneil
versus
north
carolina
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
cobb
v.
balcombe
have
come
to
me
what
is
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
a
waiver
of
constitutional
nature
must
be
established.
here,
there
is
utterly
an
absence
of
evidence
on
this
point
that
would
favor
the
state
and
all
the
evidence
clearly
is
in
the
petitioner's
favor
and
that
there
was
no
discussion
and
consideration
of
it
and
we
feel
that
constitution
here
compels
a
retrial
on
that
ground.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
should
think
the
state
would
have
to
bring
a
new
indictment
against
the
petitioner
and
would
have
try
him
anew.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
he
probably
could
plead
guilty
if
he
chose
to
do
so
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
i
were
his
lawyer
i
wouldn't
advise
him
to
plead
guilty
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
i
advise
not
guilty
plea.
some
of
the
persons
of
his
own
race
now
a
days
in
north
carolina
would
be
on
his
jury.
i
think
he'd
have
a
fair
shake
and
i'd
be
quite
willing
to
try
this
case
on
a
not
guilty
plea
and
quite
willing
to
bring
it
up
here
again
if
constitutional
defects
came
in
the
trial
which
i
hope
and
pray
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
he
fully
understands
that
because
i
explained
this
to
a
very
throughly
before
the
post
conviction
proceeding
was
commenced
whether,
a
point
ms.
bray
discussed
is
whether
one
once
having
received
life
can
be
put
at
risk
of
death
again
under
these
double
jeopardy
cases
as
i
suppose
at
issue
here.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
not
--
he
could
not
plea
guilty
to
burglary
or
rape
because
you
can
no
longer
do
so
in
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that's
right.
well,
i
believe
i
have
nothing
further
except
to
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
argument
and
praying
once
again
that
the
relief
request
be
granted.
thank
you.
