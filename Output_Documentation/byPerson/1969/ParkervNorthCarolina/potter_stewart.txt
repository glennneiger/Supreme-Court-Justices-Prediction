justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
or
not
with
the
--
with
the
law
of
your
state
which
i
certain
i'm
not
to
know
whether
it
is
the
practice
to
do
that
or
not
sure
or
is
it
varied
by
county
or
is
it
varied
by
case
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
four
i
gather
that
is
from
the
record
of
the
other
case?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
guilty
plea
and
i
suppose
the
purpose
is
to
(a)
ascertain
whether
the
guilty
plea
is
knowingly
and
voluntarily
made
not
to
cut
against
your
case,
i
don't
mean
to,
but
and
then
but
the
purpose
generally
is
for
that
and
then
also
i
suppose
insofar
as
the
trial
judge
has
discretion
in
imposing
sentence
to
apprise
him
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
so
he
can
intelligently
exercise
his
discretion,
would
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
there
was
no
discretion
as
far
as
the
[voice
overlaps]
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
proceed,
perhaps
you
didn't
understand
my
last
question.
did
the
court
have
any
discretion
whatsoever
in
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
a
mandatory
life
sentence
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
could
not
be
greater,
could
not
be
less?
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
united
states
against
jackson
argument
really
just
a
part
of
a
coerced
confession
argument
or
do
you
think
it's
an
additional
or
different
argument,
did
it
deny
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
think
in
this
case
the
--
your
claim
is
that
the
guilty
plea
resulted
from
a
combination
of
things,
all
bad
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(a)
a
coerced
confession
and
(b)
the
statutory
scheme
of
north
carolina
which
was
coercive
upon
a
person
to
plead
guilty,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
combination
of
both?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitution
you
say
compels
that
this
conviction
be
set
aside
--
this
judgment
be
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
and
for
what?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
why
you
say
it
should
be
set
aside,
but
then
set
aside
and
for
what
further
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
try
him
or
could
he
plead
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
then
wouldn't
we
back
here
with
the
same
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
as
a
practical
matter
i
suppose
to
be
the
result
or
reversal,
would
it
not,
that
he'd
be
tried
again
by
a
jury
which
as
i
understand
it
if
there
is
a
finding
of
guilt
would
result
in
a
death
sentence
unless
the
jury
recommended
mercy
in
which
it
would
be
a
life
sentence?
