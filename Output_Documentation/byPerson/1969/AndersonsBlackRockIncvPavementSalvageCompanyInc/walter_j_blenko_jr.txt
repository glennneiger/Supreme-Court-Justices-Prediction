mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
once
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
blood
around
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
ray
questioned
whether
the
district
court
had
made
findings?
there
were
no
separate
findings
made
by
the
district
court.
the
only
findings
are
such
as
appears
in
that
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
a
question
at
the
very
end
regarding
findings
by
the
district
court
upon
the
co-actions
of
the
several
elements.
as
i
have
said,
there
were
no
formal
findings
as
such.
i
think
that
the
language
which
should
be
noted
in
response
to
your
question
is
that
conclusion
of
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
that
is
on
page
26
a
of
the
printed
appendix.
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page
contains,
i
think,
the
summarizing
statement,
“it
is
my
opinion
that
plaintiff's
combination
in
no
way
exceeds
the
sum
of
its
parts.”
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
26
a,
mr.
justice,
the
last
paragraph
commencing
about
eight
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page.
my
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
it
is
avowedly
stated
as
an
opinion
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
want
to
carry
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may
because
the
evidence
which
we
pointed
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
we
point
to
here
is
in
our
submission
undisputed
and
is
the
other
way.
and
that
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
trial
judge,
we
think,
simply
does
not
find
any
support
in
the
evidence
which
was
before
you.
i
want
to
develop
that
a
little
bit
further,
i
think,
if
i
deal
with
the
facts
i
can
then
come
back.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
which
is
fact.
i
think,
necessarily
i
must
be
based
on
the
evidence.
i
do
not
think
that.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
not
referring
to
this
language
as
such.
i
think
it
is
implicit
and
tacit
and
straightforward
within
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
judges
haynswort
and
sobeloff
dealt
with
this
and
opinion
by
judge
haynswort
and
made
birth
plate
player
with
the
evidence
shows.
i
would
like
to
develop
that
evidence
with
you
a
little
bit
further
as
i
go
forward.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
we
are
into
this
area,
your
honor,
where
it
has
been
debated
back
and
forth
whether
these
are
finding
or
conclusions.
i
think,
with
all
respect,
this
probably
is
properly
a
finding
of
fact.
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
invalidity
is
plainly
a
legal
conclusion.
obviousness
is
a
factual
matter
to
be
determined
on
the
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
that
much
constitutes
of
finding
a
fact.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
clearly
erroneous
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
sustain
either.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
i
think
i
will
say
it
once.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
explicit
evidence
upon
that
point.
i
believe
that
the
proposition
which
judge
craven
brought
forward
here
was
one
which
was
in
effect
how
far
can
you
nudge
towards
or
weigh
from
the
scope
of
the
claim
and
still
have
an
infringement.
i
think
it
is
one
of
these
imperfect
infringements
if
you
will.
it
is
not
a
question
which
fairly
arises
upon
this
record
because
that
was
not
the
fact
which
was
before
the
court.
but
i
think
that
it
is
the
old
story
when
you
define
an
invention
in
claim
language
there
is
always
a
temptation.
particularly,
if
one
is
discussing
the
scope
of
the
claim
as
distinguished
from
the
practical
working
world
to
say,
well,
if
you
do
this
and
slightly
bend
the
edges
will
you
infringe?
i
feel
that
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
is.
but
there
is
no
evidence
which
directly
bears
upon
it.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
he
certainly
may
do
that.
i
think
that
in
doing
so
it
is
always
open
to
review.
we
submit
that
upon
the
whole
record
that
this
statement
simply
is
not
supportable
that
the
contrary
is
affirmatively
shown.
the
contrary
is
an
agreed
fact
and
is
admitted
by
the
defendant's
witnesses
and
by
the
real
defendant
who
is
not
the
named
party.
who
proclaimed
that
in
the
trade
their
position
in
the
courtroom
here
is
directly
opposite
to
everything
they
say
to
the
words
and
the
art.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
the
material
is
in
the
record.
i
point,
primarily,
to
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
volume
where
era
oil,
who
is
the
rail
defendant,
stated
in
this
context,
“this
remarkable
new
development
is
a
dramatic
breakthrough
in
asphalt
highway
and
road
maintenance.
infrared
heat
is
not
new
but
the
application
is
revolutionary.”
we
agree
to
that.
let
me
just
answer
this.
i
am
sorry.
era
oil
as
vice
president
appears
witness
at
the
trial.
he
acknowledged
that
these
were
the
applications
of
era
oil.
i
asked
him,
did
he
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
they
were
misrepresenting
the
fact
to
the
public?
he
said,
“certainly
not.”
i
think
that
is
good
evidence.
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
sorry.
i
brought
(inaudible).
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
in
our
submission,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
then
it
would
plainly
be
wrong.
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
which
arises
upon
this
record.
let
me
see
if
i
can
develop
that
a
little
bit.
first
of
all,
there
are
several
matters
here
which
i
think
are
beyond
dispute
if
you
look
at
the
record
as
distinguished
from
arguments
and
contentions
of
counsel.
first
of
all,
neville
did
create
a
new
combination
of
elements.
you
can
look
through
the
entire
record
and
you
will
not
find
neville's
combination
any
place
in
the
prior
art.
i
think
that
the
most
(inaudible)
comment
upon
that
was
again
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
quail.
he
was
era
oil's
vice
president.
and
at
pages
40,
41,
42
a
in
the
printed
appendix,
i
asked
him
where
he
found
the
elements
of
the
neville
patent.
and
he
said,
“you
have
to
look
at
all
the
prior
art
to
find
it.”
those
were
some
eight
pieces
of
prior
art
in
number.
so,
he
had
to
look
at
eight
of
them
in
order
to
find
the
neville
patent.
so,
we
say
on
that
basis
and
upon
a
review
of
the
element
of
the
prior
art
individually
that
this
was
a
new
combination.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
40
a
through
42
a,
your
honor,
the
last
question
and
answer
at
the
top
42a.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
develop
is
that
this
combination
was
not
an
obvious
one.
nowhere
in
the
record
will
you
find
any
testimony
by
people
skilled
in
this
art
showing
that
it
was
obvious
or
stating
it
was
obvious
to
them.
the
evidence
is
just
the
contrary.
we
brought
in
two
witnesses.
one
of
these
men
had
been
director
of
research
for
the
pennsylvania
department
of
highways.
the
inventor
came
to
him.
and
in
effect,
he
said,
“it
would
not
work.”
and
eased
him
out
of
his
office.
the
second
was
a
civilian
employee
of
the
air
force.
a
man
greatly
concerned
with
asphalt
paving.
and
he
was
interested
in
it.
and
he
spoke
with
very
real
embarrassment
which
i
think
will
show
upon
the
record
and
said,
he
showed
it
to
me
and
i
did
not
believe
it
would
work.
i
had
to
ask
somebody
else
that
i
could
rely
on
who
had
seen
it
work
to
tell
me.
that
i
got
interested.
there
is
testimony
here
as
to
the
result.
there
was
a
test
job
done
at
anderson
air
force
base.
it
is
the
subject
of
testimony.
it
showed
a
complete
difference
between
the
combination
of
the
patented
suit
and
what
had
been
done
before
that
time.
now,
this
brings
me
to
what
is
the
essential
point
and
that
is
the
elimination
of
the
cold
joint.
this
arises
when
you
lay
two
lanes
of
asphalt
bituminous
black
top,
whatever
you
would
like
to
call
it.
it's
the
sort
off
thing,
we
see
on
the
ordinary
highway.
when
you
lay
them
side
by
side,
you
almost
in
variably
lay
one
lane
and
then
bring
another
lane
and
it
alongside
later.
inventor
was
an
individual.
he
was
one
of
these
men
at
the
patent
system.
i
think,
may
be
said,
designed
to
encourage
and
protect.
he
was
not
a
part
of
any
organization.
he
concede
that
if
you
put
on
a
radiant
energy
at
the
joint
area
as
you
lay
the
second,
a
budding
course,
that
then
he
would
eliminate
this
cold
joint
where
you
never
had
a
really
good
matching
or
marriage,
as
they
call
it,
between
the
two
mats
which
have
been
laid
down.
and
he
went
around
established
people
and
he
tried
to
make
his
point
with
them
and
got
nowhere.
he
finally
got
backing
from
a
layman
who
did
not
know
much
about
it
either
but
who
sold.
and
they
went
to
work.
and
they
have
now
managed
to
bring
the
system
forward
and
show
that
this
is
a
real
and
a
workable
scheme.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
i
want
to
go
a
little
bit
further
than
that.
we
have
all
spoken
here
in
the
courtroom
in
very
generalized
terms
of
course.
but
i
want
to
take
that
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may?
the
claim
which
is
printed
and
i
would
not
try
to
deal
with
it
orally
is
lengthy,
specific
and
detailed.
it
is
in
reality
a
narrow
claim.
and
if
you
go
through
it,
you
will
find
many,
many
limitations
and
requirements.
each
of
which
must
be
met
in
order
to
infringe.
it
is
not
a
broad
claim
at
all.
now,
the
point
i
make
from
that
is
this.
if
this
claim
is
so
narrow,
it
certainly
is
an
easy
thing
to
avoid
infringement
by
changing
the
few
of
these
details.
and
you
can
make
so
much
more
radical
changes
than
trying
to
mount
these
on
two
separate
chassis.
you
can
still
stay
on
one
chassis
but
you
can
certainly
avoid
infringement
very
easily.
they
do
not
do
it.
and
the
reason
is,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
alternative.
this
is
the
essential
scheme
which
we
think
demonstrates
eventually.
now,
speaking
again
very
broadly
without
going
in
to
these
details
of
the
claimed
language.
there
are
three
elements
which
we
have
talked
about
for
convenience.
these
are
the
asphalt
or
bituminous
spreader
and
then
the
screed
element
which
shapes
it
and
you
also
have
the
radiant
energy
generator
which
bears
upon
the
previously
laid
lane
and
which
makes
it
receptive
for
the
asphalt
which
is
being
laid
alongside.
so
as
the
machine
goes
down
the
highway,
you
have
the
one
side
a
previously
laid
lane
of
asphalt,
the
paver
is
running
beside
that.
the
radiant
energy
generator
is
directing
the
radiant
energy
on
to
the
existing
lane
of
asphalt
and
then
a
new
lane
of
asphalt
is
laid
alongside.
and
because
you
do
have
the
radiant
energy,
you
get
your
marriage
of
the
two
lanes
and
you
avoid
this
cold
joint
and
everything
that
that
entails,
the
problems
that
arise
with
matters
at
court
and
the
testimony
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
for
this
purpose,
mr.
justice
black,
it
never
was
used
before
this
inventor's
time.
other
people
had
talked
radiant
energy.
they
had
had
thoughts
and
they
had
had
ideas.
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
suggest
that
people
had
not
tried
all
sorts
of
things.
this
inventor
was
not
coming
in
to
a
field
that
was
wide
open
to
him.
this
inventor
was
coming
in
to
solve
a
problem
that
had
existed
in
the
field
for
many,
many
years.
people
had
used
all
sorts
of
earlier
schemes
and
they
had
been
unsuccessful
by
and
large.
reference
has
been
made
here
to
the
morcom
patent.
and
i
want
to
say
at
once
that
you
will
find
really
little
about
it
in
the
record
because
morcom
was
really
not
the
thrust
and
the
defense
in
the
trial
court.
it
came
along
for
the
ride.
the
primary
reference
has
simply
been
abandoned
at
this
point.
so,
you
would
not
find
very
much
testimony
on
morcom.
the
testimony
that
is
there
is
that
it
would
not
work.
and
it
would
not
work
because
it
different
from
what
is
claimed
in
the
patent.
you
will
find
in
the
patent
claims,
very
specific
requirements
that
this
radiant
energy
generator
have
perforations
or
(inaudible)
that
a
combustible
gas
be
delivered
through
these
and
be
combustant
adjacent
surface
and
a
number
of
other
things.
morcom
lacks
all
of
that.
and
morcom
would
not
work
as
a
result.
they
could
use
morcom,
if
they
wanted
to
but
they
do
not
want
to.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
and
i
think
not.
certainly
these
bottled
gases
have
been
around
for
nearly
30
years
to
my
own
personal
recollection.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
application
was
1952,
if
my
memory
is
correct.
i
am
sorry,
1959.
it
is
of
course
several
years
later.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
that
is
part
of
it,
yes.
there
is
one
more
step
as
i
understand.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
and
lack
of
any
countervailing
testimony.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
does
carry
the
burden
for
us.
i
would
like
if
i
may
simply
to
restate
that
back
in
my
own
terms.
i
think
it
essentially
is
what
you
say.
there
are
three
sections
of
the
statute
to
which
we
look
in
these
matters.
these
have
been
discussed
most
recently
by
these
courts
in
graham
against
john
deer
and
united
states
against
adams.
those
are
sections
101,
102
and
103.
i
may
be
presumed
to
state
my
understanding
of
it,
it
would
be
this.
that
section
1
requires
that
there
be
an
invention
in
fact.
i
think
the
defensive
aggregation
really
is
statutory
and
is
a
section
101
defense.
in
short,
you
must
show
that
you
have
some
elements
brought
together
which
do
co-act
the
invention
in
a
patentable
or
legal
sense.
it
is
not
enough
to
claim
a
table
and
a
chair.
the
mere
fact
that
you
claim
two
things
does
not
mean
that
you
have
any
combination
or
legal
convention.
so,
i
say
that
as
a
section
101
defense.
section
102
defense
is
the
defense
lack
of
novelty.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
the
problem
is
that
no
one
has
ever
found
an
affirmative
definition
of
invention.
and
i
think
that
comes
from
its
nature
because
it
is
always
pushing
into
the
unknown.
after
we
know
the
invention,
it
is
very
easy
to
have
20/20
hindsight
and
see
all
about
it.
but
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made,
when
you
are
all
reaching
forward,
it
is
a
different
matter.
and
so,
we
always
end
up
putting
this
in
a
negative
sense.
novelty
is
not
present
at
default.
if
it
is
disclosed
in
the
exact
convention,
then
you
have
section
102
defense.
and
finally,
you
could
get
over
101
and
102;
you
have
the
section
103
hurdle
which
was
not
an
obvious
invention
to
make.
i
think,
in
essence,
this
is
a
restating
of
the
way
you
have.
well,
i
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
restate
it
in
my
own
language.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
certainly
rely
upon
his
testimony.
i
also
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
mr.
witkoski
who
was
the
former
head
of
the
research
laboratory
in
the
pennsylvania
highway
department.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
i
know
of
no
such
testimony
at
all
any
place
in
the
record.
i
do
know
some
other
testimony
which
goes
the
other
way
and
that
testimony
is
that
the
defendant
is
a
equipment
foreman,
and
even
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
said,
“i
am
not
quite
sure
why
we
do
this
but
we
do
it.”
now,
here
is
the
man
who
is
actually
out
in
the
field
who
i
think
is
the
skilled
worker
in
the
art.
even
then
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
it.
i
think
that
shows
a
complete
lack
of
obviousness.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
very
briefly
about
the
cases
which
have
been
referred
to
here
by
the
petitioner.
they
have
referred
primarily
to
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner.
i
think
all
of
the
other
cases
which
they
have
cited
are
of
the
same
strife
and
they
all
stand
or
fall
for
the
same
proposition.
i
think
that
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner
is
entirely
in
accord,
graham
against
john
deer,
united
states
versus
adams
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
in
short,
i
think
the
decisions
in
the
patent
field
are
about
as
consistent
as
the
decisions
you
will
find
in
any
body
of
law.
i
do
not
think
they
are
inconsistent
at
all.
the
problem
arises
on
the
application
of
the
law
out
of
the
facts.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
this
is
the
only
action
on
this
patent,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no,
there
have
not
been
any
formally
made
and
some
suggestions
made
but
there
has
been
nothing
brought
forward
beyond
that
point.
now,
i
want
to
say
this,
that
these
cases
i
see
at
are
all
consistent.
in
the
celanese
case
which
was
cited
by
counsel
at
the
argument
is
again
entirely
consistent
as
i
heard
him
read
it.
and
those
stand
as
i
see
it
for
this
proposition,
if
you
have
several
elements,
each
independently
hold,
and
if
you
bring
them
together
and
if
they
co-act
to
produce
a
new
result
--
in
other
words,
if
their
co-action
adds
up
to
something
more
than
their
individual
actions,
then
you
have
a
patentable
invention.
that
was
so
in
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner
where
a
number
of
the
claims
were
held
valid.
and
we
think
that
that
is
properly
so
here
for
this
reason
that
if
you
omit
the
radiant
energy
generator
you
will
get
the
cold
joint.
if
you
omit
the
spreader
you
would
not
have
a
pavement.
if
you
omit
the
shaper
you
would
not
have
a
pavement.
you
must
bring
these
three
together
and
operate
them
together
in
order
to
get
this
new
and
admittedly
beneficial
result
which
is
the
elimination
of
the
cold
joint.
now,
my
difficulty
as
i
understand
it
here
is
that
the
petitioner
declines
to
deal
with
the
overall
result.
it
is
not
answer
to
say
these
are
not
mechanically
connected.
of
course
they
are
not
mechanically
connected.
they
are
acting
at
different
places.
but
when
they
act
at
different
places
and
the
process
is
finished,
you
have
a
new
result
brought
about
by
this
machine.
the
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me,
is
one
which
was
characterized
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
a
good
many
years
ago
in
a
trademark
case,
i
believe,
of
breaking
the
fagot,
stick
by
stick.
they
declined
to
look
at
the
overall
situation
which
exists
here.
we
think
that
when
that
overall
situation
is
examined
as
we
think
that
was
properly
done
by
judges
haynswort
and
sobeloff
of
court
of
appeals
that
the
necessary
result
is
that
you
have
here
a
new
beneficial
combination,
one
which
was
not
obvious.
we
think
that
the
district
judge
and
judge
craven
ignored
the
overall
result
and
focused
if
you
will
on
too
narrow
a
point
of
view
of
looking
at
the
individual
elements
and
not
looking
at
the
overall
combination
and
recognizing
the
new
result.
cordially,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
will
all
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
at
once
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
blood
around
the
court.
mr.
justice
harlan
ray
questioned
whether
the
district
court
had
made
findings?
there
were
no
separate
findings
made
by
the
district
court.
the
only
findings
are
such
as
appears
in
that
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
a
question
at
the
very
end
regarding
findings
by
the
district
court
upon
the
co-actions
of
the
several
elements.
as
i
have
said,
there
were
no
formal
findings
as
such.
i
think
that
the
language
which
should
be
noted
in
response
to
your
question
is
that
conclusion
of
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
that
is
on
page
26
a
of
the
printed
appendix.
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page
contains,
i
think,
the
summarizing
statement,
“it
is
my
opinion
that
plaintiff's
combination
in
no
way
exceeds
the
sum
of
its
parts.”
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
26
a,
mr.
justice,
the
last
paragraph
commencing
about
eight
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page.
my
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
it
is
avowedly
stated
as
an
opinion
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
want
to
carry
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may
because
the
evidence
which
we
pointed
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
we
point
to
here
is
in
our
submission
undisputed
and
is
the
other
way.
and
that
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
trial
judge,
we
think,
simply
does
not
find
any
support
in
the
evidence
which
was
before
you.
i
want
to
develop
that
a
little
bit
further,
i
think,
if
i
deal
with
the
facts
i
can
then
come
back.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
which
is
fact.
i
think,
necessarily
i
must
be
based
on
the
evidence.
i
do
not
think
that.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
not
referring
to
this
language
as
such.
i
think
it
is
implicit
and
tacit
and
straightforward
within
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
judges
haynswort
and
sobeloff
dealt
with
this
and
opinion
by
judge
haynswort
and
made
birth
plate
player
with
the
evidence
shows.
i
would
like
to
develop
that
evidence
with
you
a
little
bit
further
as
i
go
forward.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
we
are
into
this
area,
your
honor,
where
it
has
been
debated
back
and
forth
whether
these
are
finding
or
conclusions.
i
think,
with
all
respect,
this
probably
is
properly
a
finding
of
fact.
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
invalidity
is
plainly
a
legal
conclusion.
obviousness
is
a
factual
matter
to
be
determined
on
the
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
that
much
constitutes
of
finding
a
fact.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
clearly
erroneous
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
sustain
either.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
i
think
i
will
say
it
once.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
explicit
evidence
upon
that
point.
i
believe
that
the
proposition
which
judge
craven
brought
forward
here
was
one
which
was
in
effect
how
far
can
you
nudge
towards
or
weigh
from
the
scope
of
the
claim
and
still
have
an
infringement.
i
think
it
is
one
of
these
imperfect
infringements
if
you
will.
it
is
not
a
question
which
fairly
arises
upon
this
record
because
that
was
not
the
fact
which
was
before
the
court.
but
i
think
that
it
is
the
old
story
when
you
define
an
invention
in
claim
language
there
is
always
a
temptation.
particularly,
if
one
is
discussing
the
scope
of
the
claim
as
distinguished
from
the
practical
working
world
to
say,
well,
if
you
do
this
and
slightly
bend
the
edges
will
you
infringe?
i
feel
that
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
is.
but
there
is
no
evidence
which
directly
bears
upon
it.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
he
certainly
may
do
that.
i
think
that
in
doing
so
it
is
always
open
to
review.
we
submit
that
upon
the
whole
record
that
this
statement
simply
is
not
supportable
that
the
contrary
is
affirmatively
shown.
the
contrary
is
an
agreed
fact
and
is
admitted
by
the
defendant's
witnesses
and
by
the
real
defendant
who
is
not
the
named
party.
who
proclaimed
that
in
the
trade
their
position
in
the
courtroom
here
is
directly
opposite
to
everything
they
say
to
the
words
and
the
art.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
the
material
is
in
the
record.
i
point,
primarily,
to
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
volume
where
era
oil,
who
is
the
rail
defendant,
stated
in
this
context,
“this
remarkable
new
development
is
a
dramatic
breakthrough
in
asphalt
highway
and
road
maintenance.
infrared
heat
is
not
new
but
the
application
is
revolutionary.”
we
agree
to
that.
let
me
just
answer
this.
i
am
sorry.
era
oil
as
vice
president
appears
witness
at
the
trial.
he
acknowledged
that
these
were
the
applications
of
era
oil.
i
asked
him,
did
he
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
they
were
misrepresenting
the
fact
to
the
public?
he
said,
“certainly
not.”
i
think
that
is
good
evidence.
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
sorry.
i
brought
(inaudible).
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
in
our
submission,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
think
then
it
would
plainly
be
wrong.
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case
which
arises
upon
this
record.
let
me
see
if
i
can
develop
that
a
little
bit.
first
of
all,
there
are
several
matters
here
which
i
think
are
beyond
dispute
if
you
look
at
the
record
as
distinguished
from
arguments
and
contentions
of
counsel.
first
of
all,
neville
did
create
a
new
combination
of
elements.
you
can
look
through
the
entire
record
and
you
will
not
find
neville's
combination
any
place
in
the
prior
art.
i
think
that
the
most
(inaudible)
comment
upon
that
was
again
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
quail.
he
was
era
oil's
vice
president.
and
at
pages
40,
41,
42
a
in
the
printed
appendix,
i
asked
him
where
he
found
the
elements
of
the
neville
patent.
and
he
said,
“you
have
to
look
at
all
the
prior
art
to
find
it.”
those
were
some
eight
pieces
of
prior
art
in
number.
so,
he
had
to
look
at
eight
of
them
in
order
to
find
the
neville
patent.
so,
we
say
on
that
basis
and
upon
a
review
of
the
element
of
the
prior
art
individually
that
this
was
a
new
combination.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
40
a
through
42
a,
your
honor,
the
last
question
and
answer
at
the
top
42a.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
develop
is
that
this
combination
was
not
an
obvious
one.
nowhere
in
the
record
will
you
find
any
testimony
by
people
skilled
in
this
art
showing
that
it
was
obvious
or
stating
it
was
obvious
to
them.
the
evidence
is
just
the
contrary.
we
brought
in
two
witnesses.
one
of
these
men
had
been
director
of
research
for
the
pennsylvania
department
of
highways.
the
inventor
came
to
him.
and
in
effect,
he
said,
“it
would
not
work.”
and
eased
him
out
of
his
office.
the
second
was
a
civilian
employee
of
the
air
force.
a
man
greatly
concerned
with
asphalt
paving.
and
he
was
interested
in
it.
and
he
spoke
with
very
real
embarrassment
which
i
think
will
show
upon
the
record
and
said,
he
showed
it
to
me
and
i
did
not
believe
it
would
work.
i
had
to
ask
somebody
else
that
i
could
rely
on
who
had
seen
it
work
to
tell
me.
that
i
got
interested.
there
is
testimony
here
as
to
the
result.
there
was
a
test
job
done
at
anderson
air
force
base.
it
is
the
subject
of
testimony.
it
showed
a
complete
difference
between
the
combination
of
the
patented
suit
and
what
had
been
done
before
that
time.
now,
this
brings
me
to
what
is
the
essential
point
and
that
is
the
elimination
of
the
cold
joint.
this
arises
when
you
lay
two
lanes
of
asphalt
bituminous
black
top,
whatever
you
would
like
to
call
it.
it's
the
sort
off
thing,
we
see
on
the
ordinary
highway.
when
you
lay
them
side
by
side,
you
almost
in
variably
lay
one
lane
and
then
bring
another
lane
and
it
alongside
later.
inventor
was
an
individual.
he
was
one
of
these
men
at
the
patent
system.
i
think,
may
be
said,
designed
to
encourage
and
protect.
he
was
not
a
part
of
any
organization.
he
concede
that
if
you
put
on
a
radiant
energy
at
the
joint
area
as
you
lay
the
second,
a
budding
course,
that
then
he
would
eliminate
this
cold
joint
where
you
never
had
a
really
good
matching
or
marriage,
as
they
call
it,
between
the
two
mats
which
have
been
laid
down.
and
he
went
around
established
people
and
he
tried
to
make
his
point
with
them
and
got
nowhere.
he
finally
got
backing
from
a
layman
who
did
not
know
much
about
it
either
but
who
sold.
and
they
went
to
work.
and
they
have
now
managed
to
bring
the
system
forward
and
show
that
this
is
a
real
and
a
workable
scheme.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
i
want
to
go
a
little
bit
further
than
that.
we
have
all
spoken
here
in
the
courtroom
in
very
generalized
terms
of
course.
but
i
want
to
take
that
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may?
the
claim
which
is
printed
and
i
would
not
try
to
deal
with
it
orally
is
lengthy,
specific
and
detailed.
it
is
in
reality
a
narrow
claim.
and
if
you
go
through
it,
you
will
find
many,
many
limitations
and
requirements.
each
of
which
must
be
met
in
order
to
infringe.
it
is
not
a
broad
claim
at
all.
now,
the
point
i
make
from
that
is
this.
if
this
claim
is
so
narrow,
it
certainly
is
an
easy
thing
to
avoid
infringement
by
changing
the
few
of
these
details.
and
you
can
make
so
much
more
radical
changes
than
trying
to
mount
these
on
two
separate
chassis.
you
can
still
stay
on
one
chassis
but
you
can
certainly
avoid
infringement
very
easily.
they
do
not
do
it.
and
the
reason
is,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
alternative.
this
is
the
essential
scheme
which
we
think
demonstrates
eventually.
now,
speaking
again
very
broadly
without
going
in
to
these
details
of
the
claimed
language.
there
are
three
elements
which
we
have
talked
about
for
convenience.
these
are
the
asphalt
or
bituminous
spreader
and
then
the
screed
element
which
shapes
it
and
you
also
have
the
radiant
energy
generator
which
bears
upon
the
previously
laid
lane
and
which
makes
it
receptive
for
the
asphalt
which
is
being
laid
alongside.
so
as
the
machine
goes
down
the
highway,
you
have
the
one
side
a
previously
laid
lane
of
asphalt,
the
paver
is
running
beside
that.
the
radiant
energy
generator
is
directing
the
radiant
energy
on
to
the
existing
lane
of
asphalt
and
then
a
new
lane
of
asphalt
is
laid
alongside.
and
because
you
do
have
the
radiant
energy,
you
get
your
marriage
of
the
two
lanes
and
you
avoid
this
cold
joint
and
everything
that
that
entails,
the
problems
that
arise
with
matters
at
court
and
the
testimony
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
for
this
purpose,
mr.
justice
black,
it
never
was
used
before
this
inventor's
time.
other
people
had
talked
radiant
energy.
they
had
had
thoughts
and
they
had
had
ideas.
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
suggest
that
people
had
not
tried
all
sorts
of
things.
this
inventor
was
not
coming
in
to
a
field
that
was
wide
open
to
him.
this
inventor
was
coming
in
to
solve
a
problem
that
had
existed
in
the
field
for
many,
many
years.
people
had
used
all
sorts
of
earlier
schemes
and
they
had
been
unsuccessful
by
and
large.
reference
has
been
made
here
to
the
morcom
patent.
and
i
want
to
say
at
once
that
you
will
find
really
little
about
it
in
the
record
because
morcom
was
really
not
the
thrust
and
the
defense
in
the
trial
court.
it
came
along
for
the
ride.
the
primary
reference
has
simply
been
abandoned
at
this
point.
so,
you
would
not
find
very
much
testimony
on
morcom.
the
testimony
that
is
there
is
that
it
would
not
work.
and
it
would
not
work
because
it
different
from
what
is
claimed
in
the
patent.
you
will
find
in
the
patent
claims,
very
specific
requirements
that
this
radiant
energy
generator
have
perforations
or
(inaudible)
that
a
combustible
gas
be
delivered
through
these
and
be
combustant
adjacent
surface
and
a
number
of
other
things.
morcom
lacks
all
of
that.
and
morcom
would
not
work
as
a
result.
they
could
use
morcom,
if
they
wanted
to
but
they
do
not
want
to.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
and
i
think
not.
certainly
these
bottled
gases
have
been
around
for
nearly
30
years
to
my
own
personal
recollection.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
application
was
1952,
if
my
memory
is
correct.
i
am
sorry,
1959.
it
is
of
course
several
years
later.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
that
is
part
of
it,
yes.
there
is
one
more
step
as
i
understand.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
and
lack
of
any
countervailing
testimony.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
does
carry
the
burden
for
us.
i
would
like
if
i
may
simply
to
restate
that
back
in
my
own
terms.
i
think
it
essentially
is
what
you
say.
there
are
three
sections
of
the
statute
to
which
we
look
in
these
matters.
these
have
been
discussed
most
recently
by
these
courts
in
graham
against
john
deer
and
united
states
against
adams.
those
are
sections
101,
102
and
103.
i
may
be
presumed
to
state
my
understanding
of
it,
it
would
be
this.
that
section
1
requires
that
there
be
an
invention
in
fact.
i
think
the
defensive
aggregation
really
is
statutory
and
is
a
section
101
defense.
in
short,
you
must
show
that
you
have
some
elements
brought
together
which
do
co-act
the
invention
in
a
patentable
or
legal
sense.
it
is
not
enough
to
claim
a
table
and
a
chair.
the
mere
fact
that
you
claim
two
things
does
not
mean
that
you
have
any
combination
or
legal
convention.
so,
i
say
that
as
a
section
101
defense.
section
102
defense
is
the
defense
lack
of
novelty.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
the
problem
is
that
no
one
has
ever
found
an
affirmative
definition
of
invention.
and
i
think
that
comes
from
its
nature
because
it
is
always
pushing
into
the
unknown.
after
we
know
the
invention,
it
is
very
easy
to
have
20/20
hindsight
and
see
all
about
it.
but
at
the
time
the
invention
was
made,
when
you
are
all
reaching
forward,
it
is
a
different
matter.
and
so,
we
always
end
up
putting
this
in
a
negative
sense.
novelty
is
not
present
at
default.
if
it
is
disclosed
in
the
exact
convention,
then
you
have
section
102
defense.
and
finally,
you
could
get
over
101
and
102;
you
have
the
section
103
hurdle
which
was
not
an
obvious
invention
to
make.
i
think,
in
essence,
this
is
a
restating
of
the
way
you
have.
well,
i
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
restate
it
in
my
own
language.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
i
certainly
rely
upon
his
testimony.
i
also
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
mr.
witkoski
who
was
the
former
head
of
the
research
laboratory
in
the
pennsylvania
highway
department.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
i
know
of
no
such
testimony
at
all
any
place
in
the
record.
i
do
know
some
other
testimony
which
goes
the
other
way
and
that
testimony
is
that
the
defendant
is
a
equipment
foreman,
and
even
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
he
said,
“i
am
not
quite
sure
why
we
do
this
but
we
do
it.”
now,
here
is
the
man
who
is
actually
out
in
the
field
who
i
think
is
the
skilled
worker
in
the
art.
even
then
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
it.
i
think
that
shows
a
complete
lack
of
obviousness.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
word
very
briefly
about
the
cases
which
have
been
referred
to
here
by
the
petitioner.
they
have
referred
primarily
to
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner.
i
think
all
of
the
other
cases
which
they
have
cited
are
of
the
same
strife
and
they
all
stand
or
fall
for
the
same
proposition.
i
think
that
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner
is
entirely
in
accord,
graham
against
john
deer,
united
states
versus
adams
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
in
short,
i
think
the
decisions
in
the
patent
field
are
about
as
consistent
as
the
decisions
you
will
find
in
any
body
of
law.
i
do
not
think
they
are
inconsistent
at
all.
the
problem
arises
on
the
application
of
the
law
out
of
the
facts.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
yes.
this
is
the
only
action
on
this
patent,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
j.
blenko,
jr.
no,
there
have
not
been
any
formally
made
and
some
suggestions
made
but
there
has
been
nothing
brought
forward
beyond
that
point.
now,
i
want
to
say
this,
that
these
cases
i
see
at
are
all
consistent.
in
the
celanese
case
which
was
cited
by
counsel
at
the
argument
is
again
entirely
consistent
as
i
heard
him
read
it.
and
those
stand
as
i
see
it
for
this
proposition,
if
you
have
several
elements,
each
independently
hold,
and
if
you
bring
them
together
and
if
they
co-act
to
produce
a
new
result
--
in
other
words,
if
their
co-action
adds
up
to
something
more
than
their
individual
actions,
then
you
have
a
patentable
invention.
that
was
so
in
lincoln
engineering
against
stewart
warner
where
a
number
of
the
claims
were
held
valid.
and
we
think
that
that
is
properly
so
here
for
this
reason
that
if
you
omit
the
radiant
energy
generator
you
will
get
the
cold
joint.
if
you
omit
the
spreader
you
would
not
have
a
pavement.
if
you
omit
the
shaper
you
would
not
have
a
pavement.
you
must
bring
these
three
together
and
operate
them
together
in
order
to
get
this
new
and
admittedly
beneficial
result
which
is
the
elimination
of
the
cold
joint.
now,
my
difficulty
as
i
understand
it
here
is
that
the
petitioner
declines
to
deal
with
the
overall
result.
it
is
not
answer
to
say
these
are
not
mechanically
connected.
of
course
they
are
not
mechanically
connected.
they
are
acting
at
different
places.
but
when
they
act
at
different
places
and
the
process
is
finished,
you
have
a
new
result
brought
about
by
this
machine.
the
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me,
is
one
which
was
characterized
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
a
good
many
years
ago
in
a
trademark
case,
i
believe,
of
breaking
the
fagot,
stick
by
stick.
they
declined
to
look
at
the
overall
situation
which
exists
here.
we
think
that
when
that
overall
situation
is
examined
as
we
think
that
was
properly
done
by
judges
haynswort
and
sobeloff
of
court
of
appeals
that
the
necessary
result
is
that
you
have
here
a
new
beneficial
combination,
one
which
was
not
obvious.
we
think
that
the
district
judge
and
judge
craven
ignored
the
overall
result
and
focused
if
you
will
on
too
narrow
a
point
of
view
of
looking
at
the
individual
elements
and
not
looking
at
the
overall
combination
and
recognizing
the
new
result.
cordially,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
will
all
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
