mr.
alan
w.
borst
thank
you
sir.
if
the
court
pleases,
this
is
a
civil
action,
a
case
in
patent
infringement
which
was
tried
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia.
the
trial
was
had
and
a
opinion
was
rendered
in
written
form
declined
that
the
patent
in
suit
namely
neville
patent,
number
3,005,280
was
invalid.
not
reaching
the
issue
of
infringement
on
account
of
that
adjudication.
the
appeal
was
then
made
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
here
in
richmond,
before
which
we
had
oral
argument
and
after
that,
decision
was
rendered
reversing
the
district
court,
remanding
it
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
the
infringement
issue.
stay
of
that
mandate
was
then
granted
on
petitioner's
request
pending
of
course
the
termination
of
that
whole
matter
by
this
court.
the
neville
patent
in
suit,
basically,
discloses
a
street
paver
and
suspended
from
the
street
paver
is
a
heat
generator.
the
street
paver
basically
comprises
a
hopper
which
receives
bituminous
materials
from
a
truck
which
has
obtained
the
materials
from
an
asphalt
plant.
a
distributor
which
deposits
the
material
on
a
roadbed
and
a
tamper
which
in
vibrating
fashion
compacts
the
material
on
the
road
--
on
the
bed
and
very
often
a
screed
which
irons
or
planes
the
material
so
as
to
smooth
it
and
should
finally
shape
the
pavement.
the
heater
which
is
suspended
from
the
paver
in
the
neville
case,
in
the
neville
patent
is
not
used
in
the
operation
of
the
paver
to
form
the
pavement
--
the
first
strip
of
pavement.
it
is
used
solely
when
paving
the
second
strip
which
is
to
be
laid
in
abutting
relation
to
the
first
strip.
the
heater
functions
to
preheat
the
longitudinal,
marginal
edge
of
the
first
strip
--
had
been
laid
and
which
had
allowed
to
grow
cool
and
then
the
paver
itself
deposits
the
asphalt
on
the
roadbed
and
against
the
new
--
the
preheated
edge
so
as
to
form
a
bond
therewith,
a
union
therewith
and
to
make
the
so-called
cold
joint.
the
claims
in
suit,
and
we
have
considered
claimed
for
as
representative
call
broadly
for
means
for
laying
the
asphalt
and
means
for
shaping
the
pavement.
and
broadly,
therefore,
covers
the
paver
itself.
the
claim
goes
on
to
recite
a
radiant
energy
generating
means
and
further
in
connection
with
the
radiant
energy
generating
means
that
it
comprises
a
combustion
chamber.
the
lower
plate
of
which
is
perforated.
and
through
the
holes
of
the
perforation
or
adjacent
thereto
propane
gases
or
butane
gases
are
fired
and
the
plate
thereby
becomes
incandescently
hot
and
becomes
a
source
of
radiant
energy
or
infrared
heat.
the
radiant
energy
generator
in
the
neville
patent
is
disclosed
as
far
it
is
claimed
in
the
schwank
patent
number
2,775,294
and
the
neville
specification
so
states
that
the
radiant
energy
generator
that
is
disclosed
in
the
schwank
patent
is
entirely
suitable
for
the
patentee's
purposes.
the
components
of
the
paver
and
the
components
of
the
generator
are
all
old
elements
which
are
readily
conceded
by
respondent.
in
reversing
the
district
court
--
mr.
alan
w.
borst
there
is
no
process
claims,
just
apparatus
claims.
in
reversing
the
district
court
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
commented
that
the
steps
which
occupy
the
attention
of
the
district
court
were
narrow
ones
and
went
on
to
decide
to
make
its
decision
largely
based
on
the
satisfaction
of
the
long
felt
need
and
eventual
acceptance
--
the
eventual
acceptance
of
neville's
concepts
by
respondents
experts
who
were
initially
skeptical.
the
court
then
went
on
to
find
that
the
method
of
forming
the
so-called
cold
joint
between
two
asphalt
lanes
of
concrete
highway
previous
to
neville
involve
the
process
of
cutting
back
the
vertical
marginal
edge
and
painting
it
with
asphalt.
we
feel
that
both
this
finding
of
the
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
significance
to
be
attached
to
the
expert's
original
sceptability,
and
incredulity
must
be
weighed
in
terms
of
the
prior
art
which
was
extent
at
that
time,
included
in
that
art
was
british
patent
number
756,911.
according
to
that
patent,
it
was
entirely
feasible
to
cut
back
--
to
heat
the
vertical
edge
of
the
first
laid
lane
of
concrete.
there
is
no
mention
in
this
prior
art
patent
of
cutting
back
that
edge
and
painting
it
with
hot
asphalt.
we
feel
that
knowledge
of
this
patent
as
well
as
other
patents
of
the
prior
art
as
we
feel
are
particularly
opposite
and
their
disclosures
should
be
imputed
constructively
to
the
respondents
experts
as
well
as
to
the
patentee
himself.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
all
of
it
but
the
so-called
morcom
patent
which
i
am
about
to
come
to.
the
british
patent
was
cited
during
the
prosecution
of
the
neville
application.
this
knowledge
should
be
of
the
previous
method
of
forming
the
edge
should
be
--
we
feel
should
be
imputed
as
to
the
patentee
himself
who
is
supposed
to
have
filled
a
long
felt
need
and
thereby
had
made
an
un-obvious
discovery
as
required
for
patentability
under
35
u.s.
code
103.
aside
from
this
--
petitioner
believes
it
would
be
made
to
consider
here
this
question
of
long
felt
need
or
commercial
success
and
its
function
in
patent
law
with
regard
to
the
determination
of
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
patents.
under
the
decisions,
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
a
marginal
or
peripheral
question.
this
conclusion
was
explicitly
expounded
by
this
court
in
the
a&p.
versus
supermarket
case
decided
in
1950
in
which
it
said
and
i
quote,
“commercial
success
without
invention
will
not
make
patentability.”
the
decisions
over
the
years
have
said
that
commercial
success
may
be
used
to
resolve
doubt
as
to
invention
but
not
to
inject
such
doubt.
so
therefore,
recognizing
that
such
a
ground
is
long
felt
need
is
relevant
solely
on
condition
that
after
the
usual
test
for
patentability
have
been
conducted
there
is
genuine
doubt
as
to
how
to
decide
the
issue
invention.
we
have
the
really
significant
question
here
as
to
how
much
importance
may
be
attached
to
commercial
success
when
the
only
evidence
of
that
success
have
been
adduced
by
plaintiff
relates
to
but
one
element
of
a
patented
combination
that
being
the
radiant
energy
generator
as
claimed
of
the
schwank
type.
the
two
engineers
who
testified
for
respondent
described
the
benefits
and
virtues
and
glories
of
using
a
radiant
energy
generator
of
the
schwank
type
to
heat
up
an
asphaltic
edge
which
was
to
receive
new
asphalt
in
abutting
relation.
they
did
not
testify
as
of
the
success
of
or
the
unexpected
benefits
flowing
from
the
combination
paver
and
heater
which
is
the
subject
of
the
claims.
it
is
the
combination
which
is
the
supposed
invention
not
the
heater
per
se.
the
original
claims
as
filed
in
the
patent
office
attempted
to
claim
the
heater
per
se
in
connection
with
its
use
in
highway
construction.
but
those
claims
that
neville
failed
to
get.
he
also
claimed
--
he
also
attempted
to
get
claims
to
a
process
for
using
such
a
generator.
and
those
claims
he
failed
to
get.
so
he
is
now
in
a
position
where
he
can
only
assert,
to
discuss
the
scope
of
his
invention
the
entire
combination
of
conventional
road
paver
and
specific
type
of
radiant
energy
generator.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
yes.
i
am
using
the
term
up
till
now
in
a
rather
non-technical
sense,
when
i
say
combination
i
mean
a
collocation
or
an
assembly
of
available
elements.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
our
position,
perfectly
stated
your
honor.
the
question
naturally,
therefore,
presents
itself
as
to
whether
the
respondent's
testimony
on
commercial
success
is
even
relevant
since
it
goes
only
to
the
benefits
of
one
element
of
an
assembly
of
elements
as
patented
which
is
whether
there
is
any
invention
in
this
assembly
of
old
elements.
so
let
us
look
at
the
so-called
narrow
issues
or
steps
which
occupy
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
in
fact,
these
issues
involve
the
scope
and
relevancy
of
the
prior
art
to
this
development.
it
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
the
patentee
had
solved
a
problem
which
had
hit
it
to
essentially
defied
solution.
and
it
went
into
this
question
of
aggregation
which
we
feel
was
treated
rather
cavalierly
by
the
court
below.
the
prior
art
in
this
case
which
the
petitioner
considers
most
pertinent
is
the
british
patent
which
i
have
previously
alluded
to.
the
morcom
patent
number
709014
which
issued
on
1905
and
of
course
the
schwank
patent
which
shows
the
radiant
energy
generator
used
on
the
neville
paver.
morcom
had
versed
to
the
basic
problem
of
causing
new
asphalt
to
unit
with
all
asphalt
in
place
in
road
patching.
and
what
is
morcom's
solution?
it
is
exactly
and
precisely
the
same
as
neville's,
namely,
the
use
of
radiant
energy.
respondent
has
never
tried
to
contend
throughout
the
trial
or
the
appeals
that
road
patching,
in
this
regard,
presents
any
problem
which
differs
essentially
from
road
construction
there
being
in
each
case
the
question
of
how
to
get
new
asphalt
which
is
hot
asphalt
to
unit
with
old
asphalt
which
has
been
allowed
to
grow
cold.
both
morcom
in
1905
and
neville
in
1959
on,
some
50
or
more
years
later
state
that
radiant
energy
prepares
the
cold
surface
edge
and
is
less
likely
to
scorch
it
and
say
an
open
flame.
the
british
patent
shares
everything
that
neville
claims
exceptn
hat
the
british
street
paver
heats
the
marginal
asphalt
edge
with
a
different
type
radiant
energy
heater.
it
is
not
so
denominated
in
the
british
patent
as
a
radiant
energy
heater
but
as
judge
haynswort
in
the
forth
circuit
correctly
stated,
it
is
a
radiant
energy
heater
since
it
comprises
a
combustion
chamber
which
permits
and
which
provides
for
the
firing
of
gaseous
materials
within
and
an
escape
or
discharge
opening
causing
the
bottom
of
the
heater
to
raise
its
temperature.
and,
therefore
of
necessity
becomes
a
source
of
radiant
heat
from
a
scientific
point
of
view;
anybody
in
fact
which
have
a
temperature
of
in
excess
of
absolute
zero
degrees
is
a
source
of
radiant
heat.
secondly,
he
would
seem
that
if
radiant
heat
was
desirable,
suggested
by
morcom,
such
a
heater
of
any
type
could
be
obviously
substituted
for
the
radiation
heater
in
the
british
claim
without
making
invention.
schwank,
as
explained,
shows
the
heater
as
that
component's
claimed
in
neville.
and
that
patent
is
in
fact
mentioned
in
the
neville
patent
as
been
exposing
a
heater
which
is
suitable
for
the
patentee's
purposes.
the
district
court
went
on
to
discuss
this
question
of
aggregation.
there
is
no
question
here.
and
respondents'
experts
and
certainly
petitioners'
expert
have
agreed
that
the
paver
operates
entirely
independently
of
the
heater.
and
the
heater
operates
independently
of
the
paver.
therefore,
the
heater
will
function
in
precisely
the
same
manner
where
the
tamper,
for
example,
has
been
operated
whether
the
distributor
is
actually
laying
material
or
whether
the
screed
as
there
to
smooth
the
material.
this
is
a
unquestioned
fact
as
well,
that
the
heater
in
constructing
the
adjoining
road
blocks
of
a
single
lane
is
removed
from
the
paver
and
is
placed
on
a
separate
mobile
support
and
used
to
make
the
transverse
edge
of
the
two
adjoining
highway
blocks
in
the
single
lane
of
highway.
in
discussing
this
whole
question,
this
court,
in
deciding
the
lincoln
engineering
case
which
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
in
its
briefs
and
petitions,
found
that
at
least
one
definition
of
aggregation
was
that
the
total
of
the
old
elements
must
somehow
exceed
the
sum
of
the
parts.
and
then
finding
the
system
there
disclosed
which
was
a
system
for
injecting
grease
into
the
bearings
of
automobile
which
included
a
piston
pump
on
a
conduit
communicating
therewith
and
a
coupling
consisting
of
jaws
were
aggregated.
they
bank
the
court
makes
at
that
time
an
observation
which
we
think
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
the
situation
here.
the
court,
perhaps,
overturn
suggested
that
if
the
patentee
had
addressed
his
claims
to
the
jaws
perceived,
he
might
have
found
himself
with
a
valid
patent.
but
in
fact,
he
did
not
and
then
by
the
time
this
patent
got
before
this
court
it
was,
of
course,
too
late
to
do
that.
it
might
be
of
interest
to
this
court
to
note
that
there
are
several
cases
in
great
britain
which
deal
with
the
subject
of
aggregation
which
have
not
been
brought
to
its
attention
in
the
briefs.
and
i
thought
i
might
do
it
now,
if
the
court
indulges
me.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
all
right,
i
will
do
it.
one
case
is
the
famous
and
classic
sausage
machine
case
which
was
decided
by
the
transfer
division
of
the
high
court
of
appeals
in
1890.
in
that
case,
the
meat
grinder
ground
the
sausage
meat
and
then
the
filling
machine
was
placed
somehow
in
communication
with
the
grinder
so
that
that
machine
filled
the
sausage
skin
with
the
ground
meat.
the
high
court
of
appeals
transfer
division
stated
that
while
it
must
be
recognized
as
something
new
and
useful
was
done
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
two
components
operate
so
independently
at
one
another
from
the
standpoint
of
function
and
are,
in
fact,
separate
from
one
another
from
the
standpoint
of
structure
that
the
claims
to
the
two
elements
are
arrogating
and
therefore
invalid.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
it
may
be
hard
to
generalize
because
much
of
our
law
has
undergone
transformation
or
modification
of
statute.
the
question
of
aggregation
is
not
a
statutory
matter
but
has
come
through
a
law
of
patents
in
this
country
and,
i
believe
in
great
britain,
in
a
parallel
way
to
describe
decision
of
my
decision-making.
i
think
that
the
courts
have
felt
better
out
of
this
apple
boat
and
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
standard
of
invention
and
obviousness
and,
therefore,
have
continued
to
retain
as
an
operating
rule.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
there
are
patent
statutes
but
which
have
been
construed
and
so
the
law
has
evolved
through
construction
as
our
law
has
evolved
by
amendment
to
statute.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
true.
the
house
of
lords
itself
in
1935
in
the
case
of
celanese
limited
versus
courtaulds
with
lord
talmud
speaking
for
the
court
made
this
definition
of
aggregation
which
i
think
can
be
accepted
by
american
courts
today.
when
he
said,
as
i
quote,
“as
accepted
a
sound
law
that
a
mere
placing
side
by
side
of
old
integers
so
that
each
perform
its
own
proper
function
independently
of
any
of
the
others
is
not
a
patentable
combination
but
that
where
the
old
integers
when
placed
together
have
some
working
interrelation
producing
a
new
or
improved
result
then
there
is
patentable
subject
matter
in
the
idea
of
the
working
interrelation
brought
about
by
the
collocation
of
the
integers.”
mr.
alan
w.
borst
collocation
of
the
integers.
the
first
case
that
i
have
cited
may
be
found
that
is
s.
williams
versus
ni
in
7
rpc
62,
rpc
being
an
acronym
for
report
on
patent
cases.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
nothing
whatsoever
sir.
we
have
contended
that
the
only
reason
that
neville
has
done
this
is
entirely,
one,
for
convenience.
here
we
get
the
same
result
perhaps
a
little
--
exactly
more
practical
and
it's
better
to
provide
a
separate
little
cart
running
ahead
of
the
street
paver.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
when
it
discussed
this
whole
question
of
aggregation,
it
was
discussing
that
problem
because
they
functioned
separately,
the
two
elements,
the
paver
and
the
generator
exactly
precisely
in
the
same
way
whether
they
are
put
together
or
whether
they
were
on
the
same
(inaudible)
or
whether
they
were
on
different
mobile
supports.

it
did.

though
new
function
performed
by
a
patentable
combination.
it
would
be
somewhat
unfair
to
say
that
there
was
no
new
function
in
its
entirety
because
it
is
true
that
no
one
else
has
used
before
a
schwank
type
heater
to
transmit
radiant
energy
to
it…
mr.
alan
w.
borst
as
they
always
have.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
what
the
district
court
did
hold.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
it
made
no
direct
reference
to
that
finding
except
to
say
that
the
district
court
dealt
with
narrow
issues.
i
was
about
to
give
the
citation
the
chief
justice
asked
for,
for
the
case
of
the

namely,
celanese
versus

as
that

we
have
laterally
contented
in
this
case
that
this
suit
could
also
be
decided
on
the
question
of
exhausted
combination.
a
combination
which
has
been
prepped
of
all
elements
which
have
been
previously
patented
may
not
be
re-patented
merely
because
one
has
improved
one
of
the
elements
of
that
combination.
and
that
may
be
exemplified
by
saying
that
if
one
improves
a
sparkplug
or
a
carburetor,
he
is
not
entitled
to
reclaim
the
engine
block
and
the
steering
apparatus
and
windshield
wipers
and
the
safety
belts
that
go
today
to
make
up
a
combination
which
we
know
is
an
automobile.
the
position
that
we
take
on
this
matter,
we
believe
is
amply
supported
by
the
decision
in
this
court
entitled
basic
manufacturing
code
versus
rm
hollingted
which
is
cited
at
298

mr.

refers
to

if
the
court
pleases,
this
is
a
civil
action,
a
case
in
patent
infringement
which
was
tried
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia.
the
trial
was
had
and
a
opinion
was
rendered
in

form

that

namely
neville
patent,
number
3,005,280
was
invalid.
not
reaching
the
issue
of
infringement
on
account
of
that
adjudication.
the
appeal
was
then
made
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
here
in
richmond,
before
which
we
had
oral
argument
and
after
that,
decision
was
rendered
reversing
the
district
court,
remanding
it
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
the
infringement
issue.
stay
of
that
mandate
was
then
granted
on
petitioner's
request
pending
of
course
the
termination
of
that
whole
matter
by
this
court.
the
neville
patent
in
suit,
basically,
discloses
a
street
paver
and
suspended
from
the
street
paver
is
a
heat
generator.
the
street
paver
basically
comprises
a
hopper
which
receives
bituminous
materials
from
a
truck
which
has
obtained
the
materials
from
an
asphalt
plant.
a
distributor
which
deposits
the
material
on
a
roadbed
and
a
tamper
which
in
vibrating
fashion
compacts
the
material
on
the
road
--
on
the
bed
and
very
often
a
screed
which
irons
or
planes
the
material
so
as
to
smooth
it
and
should
finally
shape
the
pavement.
the
heater
which
is
suspended
from
the
paver
in
the
neville
case,
in
the
neville
patent
is
not
used
in
the
operation
of
the
paver
to
form
the
pavement
--
the
first
strip
of
pavement.
it
is
used
solely
when
paving
the
second
strip
which
is
to
be
laid
in
abutting
relation
to
the
first
strip.
the
heater
functions
to
preheat
the
longitudinal,
marginal
edge
of
the
first
strip
--
had
been
laid
and
which
had
allowed
to
grow
cool
and
then
the
paver
itself
deposits
the
asphalt
on
the
roadbed
and
against
the
new
--
the
preheated
edge
so
as
to
form
a
bond
therewith,
a
union
therewith
and
to
make
the
so-called
cold
joint.
the
claims
in
suit,
and
we
have
considered
claimed
for
as
representative
call
broadly
for
means
for
laying
the
asphalt
and
means
for
shaping
the
pavement.
and
broadly,
therefore,
covers
the
paver
itself.
the
claim
goes
on
to
recite
a
radiant
energy
generating
means
and
further
in
connection
with
the
radiant
energy
generating
means
that
it
comprises
a
combustion
chamber.
the
lower
plate
of
which
is
perforated.
and
through
the
holes
of
the
perforation
or
adjacent
thereto
propane
gases
or
butane
gases
are
fired
and
the
plate
thereby
becomes
incandescently
hot
and
becomes
a
source
of
radiant
energy
or
infrared
heat.
the
radiant
energy
generator
in
the
neville
patent
is
disclosed
as
far
it
is
claimed
in
the
schwank
patent
number
2,775,294
and
the
neville
specification
so
states
that
the
radiant
energy
generator
that
is
disclosed
in
the
schwank
patent
is
entirely
suitable
for
the
patentee's
purposes.
the
components
of
the
paver
and
the
components
of
the
generator
are
all
old
elements
which
are
readily
conceded
by
respondent.
in
reversing
the
district
court
--
mr.
alan
w.
borst
there
is
no
process
claims,
just
apparatus
claims.
in
reversing
the
district
court
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
commented
that
the
steps
which
occupy
the
attention
of
the
district
court
were
narrow
ones
and
went
on
to
decide
to
make
its
decision
largely
based
on
the
satisfaction
of
the
long
felt
need
and
eventual
acceptance
--
the
eventual
acceptance
of
neville's
concepts
by
respondents
experts
who
were
initially
skeptical.
the
court
then
went
on
to
find
that
the
method
of
forming
the
so-called
cold
joint
between
two
asphalt
lanes
of
concrete
highway
previous
to
neville
involve
the
process
of
cutting
back
the
vertical
marginal
edge
and
painting
it
with
asphalt.
we
feel
that
both
this
finding
of
the
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
significance
to
be
attached
to
the
expert's
original
sceptability,
and
incredulity
must
be
weighed
in
terms
of
the
prior
art
which
was
extent
at
that
time,
included
in
that
art
was
british
patent
number
756,911.
according
to
that
patent,
it
was
entirely
feasible
to
cut
back
--
to
heat
the
vertical
edge
of
the
first
laid
lane
of
concrete.
there
is
no
mention
in
this
prior
art
patent
of
cutting
back
that
edge
and
painting
it
with
hot
asphalt.
we
feel
that
knowledge
of
this
patent
as
well
as
other
patents
of
the
prior
art
as
we
feel
are
particularly
opposite
and
their
disclosures
should
be
imputed
constructively
to
the
respondents
experts
as
well
as
to
the
patentee
himself.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
all
of
it
but
the
so-called
morcom
patent
which
i
am
about
to
come
to.
the
british
patent
was
cited
during
the
prosecution
of
the
neville
application.
this
knowledge
should
be
of
the
previous
method
of
forming
the
edge
should
be
--
we
feel
should
be
imputed
as
to
the
patentee
himself
who
is
supposed
to
have
filled
a
long
felt
need
and
thereby
had
made
an
un-obvious
discovery
as
required
for
patentability
under
35
u.s.
code
103.
aside
from
this
--
petitioner
believes
it
would
be
made
to
consider
here
this
question
of
long
felt
need
or
commercial
success
and
its
function
in
patent
law
with
regard
to
the
determination
of
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
patents.
under
the
decisions,
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
a
marginal
or
peripheral
question.
this
conclusion
was
explicitly
expounded
by
this
court
in
the
a&p.
versus
supermarket
case
decided
in
1950
in
which
it
said
and
i
quote,
“commercial
success
without
invention
will
not
make
patentability.”
the
decisions
over
the
years
have
said
that
commercial
success
may
be
used
to
resolve
doubt
as
to
invention
but
not
to
inject
such
doubt.
so
therefore,
recognizing
that
such
a
ground
is
long
felt
need
is
relevant
solely
on
condition
that
after
the
usual
test
for
patentability
have
been
conducted
there
is
genuine
doubt
as
to
how
to
decide
the
issue
invention.
we
have
the
really
significant
question
here
as
to
how
much
importance
may
be
attached
to
commercial
success
when
the
only
evidence
of
that
success
have
been
adduced
by
plaintiff
relates
to
but
one
element
of
a
patented
combination
that
being
the
radiant
energy
generator
as
claimed
of
the
schwank
type.
the
two
engineers
who
testified
for
respondent
described
the
benefits
and
virtues
and
glories
of
using
a
radiant
energy
generator
of
the
schwank
type
to
heat
up
an
asphaltic
edge
which
was
to
receive
new
asphalt
in
abutting
relation.
they
did
not
testify
as
of
the
success
of
or
the
unexpected
benefits
flowing
from
the
combination
paver
and
heater
which
is
the
subject
of
the
claims.
it
is
the
combination
which
is
the
supposed
invention
not
the
heater
per
se.
the
original
claims
as
filed
in
the
patent
office
attempted
to
claim
the
heater
per
se
in
connection
with
its
use
in
highway
construction.
but
those
claims
that
neville
failed
to
get.
he
also
claimed
--
he
also
attempted
to
get
claims
to
a
process
for
using
such
a
generator.
and
those
claims
he
failed
to
get.
so
he
is
now
in
a
position
where
he
can
only
assert,
to
discuss
the
scope
of
his
invention
the
entire
combination
of
conventional
road
paver
and
specific
type
of
radiant
energy
generator.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
yes.
i
am
using
the
term
up
till
now
in
a
rather
non-technical
sense,
when
i
say
combination
i
mean
a
collocation
or
an
assembly
of
available
elements.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
our
position,
perfectly
stated
your
honor.
the
question
naturally,
therefore,
presents
itself
as
to
whether
the
respondent's
testimony
on
commercial
success
is
even
relevant
since
it
goes
only
to
the
benefits
of
one
element
of
an
assembly
of
elements
as
patented
which
is
whether
there
is
any
invention
in
this
assembly
of
old
elements.
so
let
us
look
at
the
so-called
narrow
issues
or
steps
which
occupy
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
in
fact,
these
issues
involve
the
scope
and
relevancy
of
the
prior
art
to
this
development.
it
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
the
patentee
had
solved
a
problem
which
had
hit
it
to
essentially
defied
solution.
and
it
went
into
this
question
of
aggregation
which
we
feel
was
treated
rather
cavalierly
by
the
court
below.
the
prior
art
in
this
case
which
the
petitioner
considers
most
pertinent
is
the
british
patent
which
i
have
previously
alluded
to.
the
morcom
patent
number
709014
which
issued
on
1905
and
of
course
the
schwank
patent
which
shows
the
radiant
energy
generator
used
on
the
neville
paver.
morcom
had
versed
to
the
basic
problem
of
causing
new
asphalt
to
unit
with
all
asphalt
in
place
in
road
patching.
and
what
is
morcom's
solution?
it
is
exactly
and
precisely
the
same
as
neville's,
namely,
the
use
of
radiant
energy.
respondent
has
never
tried
to
contend
throughout
the
trial
or
the
appeals
that
road
patching,
in
this
regard,
presents
any
problem
which
differs
essentially
from
road
construction
there
being
in
each
case
the
question
of
how
to
get
new
asphalt
which
is
hot
asphalt
to
unit
with
old
asphalt
which
has
been
allowed
to
grow
cold.
both
morcom
in
1905
and
neville
in
1959
on,
some
50
or
more
years
later
state
that
radiant
energy
prepares
the
cold
surface
edge
and
is
less
likely
to
scorch
it
and
say
an
open
flame.
the
british
patent
shares
everything
that
neville
claims
exceptn
hat
the
british
street
paver
heats
the
marginal
asphalt
edge
with
a
different
type
radiant
energy
heater.
it
is
not
so
denominated
in
the
british
patent
as
a
radiant
energy
heater
but
as
judge
haynswort
in
the
forth
circuit
correctly
stated,
it
is
a
radiant
energy
heater
since
it
comprises
a
combustion
chamber
which
permits
and
which
provides
for
the
firing
of
gaseous
materials
within
and
an
escape
or
discharge
opening
causing
the
bottom
of
the
heater
to
raise
its
temperature.
and,
therefore
of
necessity
becomes
a
source
of
radiant
heat
from
a
scientific
point
of
view;
anybody
in
fact
which
have
a
temperature
of
in
excess
of
absolute
zero
degrees
is
a
source
of
radiant
heat.
secondly,
he
would
seem
that
if
radiant
heat
was
desirable,
suggested
by
morcom,
such
a
heater
of
any
type
could
be
obviously
substituted
for
the
radiation
heater
in
the
british
claim
without
making
invention.
schwank,
as
explained,
shows
the
heater
as
that
component's
claimed
in
neville.
and
that
patent
is
in
fact
mentioned
in
the
neville
patent
as
been
exposing
a
heater
which
is
suitable
for
the
patentee's
purposes.
the
district
court
went
on
to
discuss
this
question
of
aggregation.
there
is
no
question
here.
and
respondents'
experts
and
certainly
petitioners'
expert
have
agreed
that
the
paver
operates
entirely
independently
of
the
heater.
and
the
heater
operates
independently
of
the
paver.
therefore,
the
heater
will
function
in
precisely
the
same
manner
where
the
tamper,
for
example,
has
been
operated
whether
the
distributor
is
actually
laying
material
or
whether
the
screed
as
there
to
smooth
the
material.
this
is
a
unquestioned
fact
as
well,
that
the
heater
in
constructing
the
adjoining
road
blocks
of
a
single
lane
is
removed
from
the
paver
and
is
placed
on
a
separate
mobile
support
and
used
to
make
the
transverse
edge
of
the
two
adjoining
highway
blocks
in
the
single
lane
of
highway.
in
discussing
this
whole
question,
this
court,
in
deciding
the
lincoln
engineering
case
which
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
in
its
briefs
and
petitions,
found
that
at
least
one
definition
of
aggregation
was
that
the
total
of
the
old
elements
must
somehow
exceed
the
sum
of
the
parts.
and
then
finding
the
system
there
disclosed
which
was
a
system
for
injecting
grease
into
the
bearings
of
automobile
which
included
a
piston
pump
on
a
conduit
communicating
therewith
and
a
coupling
consisting
of
jaws
were
aggregated.
they
bank
the
court
makes
at
that
time
an
observation
which
we
think
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
the
situation
here.
the
court,
perhaps,
overturn
suggested
that
if
the
patentee
had
addressed
his
claims
to
the
jaws
perceived,
he
might
have
found
himself
with
a
valid
patent.
but
in
fact,
he
did
not
and
then
by
the
time
this
patent
got
before
this
court
it
was,
of
course,
too
late
to
do
that.
it
might
be
of
interest
to
this
court
to
note
that
there
are
several
cases
in
great
britain
which
deal
with
the
subject
of
aggregation
which
have
not
been
brought
to
its
attention
in
the
briefs.
and
i
thought
i
might
do
it
now,
if
the
court
indulges
me.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
all
right,
i
will
do
it.
one
case
is
the
famous
and
classic
sausage
machine
case
which
was
decided
by
the
transfer
division
of
the
high
court
of
appeals
in
1890.
in
that
case,
the
meat
grinder
ground
the
sausage
meat
and
then
the
filling
machine
was
placed
somehow
in
communication
with
the
grinder
so
that
that
machine
filled
the
sausage
skin
with
the
ground
meat.
the
high
court
of
appeals
transfer
division
stated
that
while
it
must
be
recognized
as
something
new
and
useful
was
done
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
two
components
operate
so
independently
at
one
another
from
the
standpoint
of
function
and
are,
in
fact,
separate
from
one
another
from
the
standpoint
of
structure
that
the
claims
to
the
two
elements
are
arrogating
and
therefore
invalid.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
it
may
be
hard
to
generalize
because
much
of
our
law
has
undergone
transformation
or
modification
of
statute.
the
question
of
aggregation
is
not
a
statutory
matter
but
has
come
through
a
law
of
patents
in
this
country
and,
i
believe
in
great
britain,
in
a
parallel
way
to
describe
decision
of
my
decision-making.
i
think
that
the
courts
have
felt
better
out
of
this
apple
boat
and
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
standard
of
invention
and
obviousness
and,
therefore,
have
continued
to
retain
as
an
operating
rule.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
there
are
patent
statutes
but
which
have
been
construed
and
so
the
law
has
evolved
through
construction
as
our
law
has
evolved
by
amendment
to
statute.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
true.
the
house
of
lords
itself
in
1935
in
the
case
of
celanese
limited
versus
courtaulds
with
lord
talmud
speaking
for
the
court
made
this
definition
of
aggregation
which
i
think
can
be
accepted
by
american
courts
today.
when
he
said,
as
i
quote,
“as
accepted
a
sound
law
that
a
mere
placing
side
by
side
of
old
integers
so
that
each
perform
its
own
proper
function
independently
of
any
of
the
others
is
not
a
patentable
combination
but
that
where
the
old
integers
when
placed
together
have
some
working
interrelation
producing
a
new
or
improved
result
then
there
is
patentable
subject
matter
in
the
idea
of
the
working
interrelation
brought
about
by
the
collocation
of
the
integers.”
mr.
alan
w.
borst
collocation
of
the
integers.
the
first
case
that
i
have
cited
may
be
found
that
is
s.
williams
versus
ni
in
7
rpc
62,
rpc
being
an
acronym
for
report
on
patent
cases.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
nothing
whatsoever
sir.
we
have
contended
that
the
only
reason
that
neville
has
done
this
is
entirely,
one,
for
convenience.
here
we
get
the
same
result
perhaps
a
little
--
exactly
more
practical
and
it's
better
to
provide
a
separate
little
cart
running
ahead
of
the
street
paver.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
when
it
discussed
this
whole
question
of
aggregation,
it
was
discussing
that
problem
because
they
functioned
separately,
the
two
elements,
the
paver
and
the
generator
exactly
precisely
in
the
same
way
whether
they
are
put
together
or
whether
they
were
on
the
same
(inaudible)
or
whether
they
were
on
different
mobile
supports.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
yes,
it
did.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
though
new
function
performed
by
a
patentable
combination.
it
would
be
somewhat
unfair
to
say
that
there
was
no
new
function
in
its
entirety
because
it
is
true
that
no
one
else
has
used
before
a
schwank
type
heater
to
transmit
radiant
energy
to
it…
mr.
alan
w.
borst
as
they
always
have.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that
is
what
the
district
court
did
hold.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
it
made
no
direct
reference
to
that
finding
except
to
say
that
the
district
court
dealt
with
narrow
issues.
i
was
about
to
give
the
citation
the
chief
justice
asked
for,
for
the
case
of
the
house
of
lords
1935,
namely,
celanese
versus
courltaulds
as
that
may
be
found
a
52
rpc
171
particularly
noting
page
193.
we
have
laterally
contented
in
this
case
that
this
suit
could
also
be
decided
on
the
question
of
exhausted
combination.
a
combination
which
has
been
prepped
of
all
elements
which
have
been
previously
patented
may
not
be
re-patented
merely
because
one
has
improved
one
of
the
elements
of
that
combination.
and
that
may
be
exemplified
by
saying
that
if
one
improves
a
sparkplug
or
a
carburetor,
he
is
not
entitled
to
reclaim
the
engine
block
and
the
steering
apparatus
and
windshield
wipers
and
the
safety
belts
that
go
today
to
make
up
a
combination
which
we
know
is
an
automobile.
the
position
that
we
take
on
this
matter,
we
believe
is
amply
supported
by
the
decision
in
this
court
entitled
basic
manufacturing
code
versus
rm
hollingted
which
is
cited
at
298
u.s.
415.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
petitioner
refers
to
era
oil's
ads
as
extolling
some
part
of
this
invention.
well,
it
is
true
at
some
part
of
this
invention
as
claimed.
era
oil
only
makes
the
heater
and
so
it
hardly
could
be
extolling
the
combination
which
is
claimed,
the
heater
plus
the
paver.
but
there
was
testimony
adduced
on
behalf
of
petitioner
and
behalf
of
its
assertion
that
there
was
aggregation
to
hear.
that
is
that
in
the
appendix
on
38

to
the
trial
transcript
on
page
113
through
114
at
one
point.
i
know
that
there
is
other
testimony
in
record.
mr.
alan
w.
borst
they
testified
that
there
was
no
invention
here
because
they
--
mr.
alan
w.
borst
that,
of
course,
the
conclusion.
it
is
right.
but
their
contention
has
been
that
the
use
of
radiant
energy
is
old
and
therefore
the
continued
use
of
it
should
be
permitted.
mr.
alan
w.

i
overstated.

energy
to
form
an
asphaltic
bond
or
joint
between
two
abutting
lanes
of
highway.
that
is
in
the
art.
and
whether
or
not
has
been
used
of
course
is
not
necessarily
relevant
to
the
question
here
if
it
is
of
a
prior
art.
