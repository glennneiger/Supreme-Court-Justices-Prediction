there's

no

patent
involved
here
though,
is
it,
just
two
products?
justice

it's
your
submission
that
this
is
not
a
combination

rather
says
simply
an
aggregation?

selection
of
(voice

the
collection
of
other
--
the
collection
of
known
ingredients?
justice
potter
stewart
but
technically,
it
is
your
claim
that
this
is
an
aggregation
and
i
understand
your
submission
is
that
the
law
is
that
a
mere
aggregation
is
never
patentable.
a
combination
may
be
patentable
if
it
combines
all
elements
to
reach
a

result.
is

justice

stewart
mr.
borst,
i
have
the
knowdghe
am
not
the
lawyer
to
know
how
similar
or
how
different
it
is
the
british
law
patents
from
our
law
or
the
british
law
of
1890
from
our
law
of
1969.
help
me
in
your
discussion
with
these
british
cases
if
you
could
indicate
at
least
your
submission
as
to
if
that
laws
were
identical
or
different?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
in
great
britain,
is
patent
law
a
common
law
so
to
speak
or
are
there
a
series
of
statutes
as
we
have?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
we,
unlike
them
have
a
constitutional
provision
that
we
sometimes
cross
over.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
get
into
this
discussion
of
the
evidence
in
your
own
time,
mr.
blenko,
the
statement
in
judge
pavens
dissenting
opinion
which
is
the
specific
aspect
of
what
you
just
been
discussing
in
which
was
the
subject
of
justice
harlan's
question
right
in
the
right
first
paragraph.
he
says,
“nor
has
it
demonstrated
to
my
satisfaction
that
the
combination
on
one
chassis
of
the
paving
machine
and
heat
generator
is
necessary
to
produce
the
desired
result.
that
is
the
combination
on
one
body
in
set
of
wheels.
yet
the
combination
is
held
patentable.
although,
for
all
we
know,
the
same
desired
result
may
be
achieved
by
two
machines
juxtaposed
and
separately
propelled.”
that
is
i
say
is
one
specific
aspect
rather
dramatically
i
would
suppose
presenting
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
combination
is
simply
the
known
expectable
result
of
the
combination
of
all
ingredients
or
whether
it
is
one
in
which
the
result
exceeds
the
sum
of
its
parts.
and
would
like
to
know
what
the
evidence
shows
on
that
particular
aspect
if
can
might
as
know
if
sure
can
means.
justice
potter
stewart
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
was
part
of
the
problem
until
this
came
along,
the
unavailability
of
the
right
kind
of
combustible
gas?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
date
to
this
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
can
be
sure,
i
understand
your
legal
position,
mr.
blenko.
as
i
understand
it,
you
told
us
that
first
of
all
that
this
was
a
combination,
not
an
aggregation.
and
you
told
us
that
it
was
a
new
combination.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
mean
that
that
is
necessarily
patentable
so
far.
those
are
just
the
first
two
steps
in
the
combination
patent,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
one
more
step.
and
you
say
that
it
was
not
obvious.
and
for
that
statements,
you
rely
on
testimony
of
the
people
who
said
they
did
not
think
it
would
work.
they
were
skeptical
about
it.
justice
potter

down
the
absence
of
any
countervailing
testimony?
justice

is
that
enough
in
