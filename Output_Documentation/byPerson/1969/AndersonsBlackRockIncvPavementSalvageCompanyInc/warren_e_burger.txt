mr.

you

whenever
you

chief

you

that
the
close
of

you

mr.
blenko.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blenko,
you
said
in
response
to
question
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
second
sentence
in
the
final
paragraph
on
page
26a
is
essentially
a
finding
of
fact
even
though
i
am
not
cast
in
the
farm
language.
and
then
you
said
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
now,
i
take
it
you
mean
that
no
one
picked
out
each
of
the
parts
that
were
dealt
with
in
that
sentence
and
said
you
gave
a
testimony
to
the
contrary.
but
may
not
a
trial
of
fact
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole
and
viewing
the
record
as
a
whole
and
synthesizing
all
the
testimony
make
findings
even
though
no
one
has
no
particular
witness
as
addressed
himself
to
each
of
the
parts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
they
proclaimed
it
to
the
trade,
do
you
mean
in
there
advertising
material
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
court
can
rely
on
that
as
evidence
of
the
fact,
this
context?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
that
last
page
reference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
rely
rather
strongly
on
the
testimony
of
the
military
engineer
who
dealt
with
laying
asphalt
pavement
on
air
force.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
total
record
which
disputes
their
statement
that
this
was
not
obvious
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
borst,
you
have
two
minutes
left
that
is
just
about
one
flick
before
lunch
hour.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed
that
there
are
three
expert
witnesses
here
who
testified
rather
explicitly
that
this
was
not
obvious
to
them.
they
had
very
large
credentials.
did
you
have
any
expert
witness
to
testify
who
said
that
this
was
obvious
in
their
minds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
conclusion
of
law.

of

the
use
of
