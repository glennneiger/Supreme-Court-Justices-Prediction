mr.
lynn
s.
castner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america,
communist
party
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
mrs.
charlene
mitchell
and
mr.
michael
zagerell,
1968
communist
party
presidential
and
vice
presidential
candidates,
mrs.
betty
smith
state
secretary
of
the
minnesota
communist
party,
10
presidential
electors
from
the
state
of
minnesota
for
the
communist
party,
two
plaintiff
appellees
representing
the
2,394
registered
voters
who
signed
a
petition
to
put
the
communist
party
candidates
on
the
1968
ballot
and
one
registered
voter
who
did
not
sign
the
petition.
the
communist
party
of
the
state
of
minnesota
as
well
as
the
national
party
are
unincorporated
associations.
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
held
a
duly
convened
statewide
convention
in
minnesota
on
or
about
june
23,
1968.
they
elected
six
delegates
and
an
alternate
delegate
to
the
national
convention
of
the
communist
party
u.s.a,
which
was
called
for
and
held
in
new
york,
july
4
to
july
7,
1968.
at
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
convention,
a
motion
was
passed
that
if
the
communist
party
u.s.a
nominated
a
presidential
ticket
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
would
endeavor
to
place
on
the
ballot
in
minnesota
those
candidates.
mrs.
betty
smith
attended
that
convention
as
a
delegate
in
new
york.
mrs.
mitchell
and
mr.
zagerell
were
duly
nominated
by
that
convention
immediately
following
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
mounted
a
campaign
to
obtain
the
requisite
number
of
signatures,
under
minnesota
law,
2000
to
place
the
candidates
on
the
ballot.
on
this
nominating
petition
appeared
the
name
of
the
ten
communist
presidential
electors
and
under
minnesota
law
on
the
ballot
only
appears
the
name
of
the
candidates
and
by
minnesota
law,
a
vote
for
the
candidates
is
a
vote
for
those
electors.
on
sunday,
september
8,
the
party
completed
its
campaign
to
collect
signatures.
on
the
next
day,
monday
the
9th,
representatives
of
the
communist
party,
the
national
office
as
well
as
the
state
appeared
at
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
of
minnesota
joseph
donovan
to
file
the
nominating
petition.
the
party
representatives
arrived
at
the
secretary
of
state's
office
during
the
noon
hour.
immediately
after
noon,
they
tendered
their
petition.
this
petition
was
anticipated
and
they
were
presented
a
written
refusal
of
the
secretary
of
state.
he
did
examine
the
contents
of
the
package
and
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
the
nominating
petition
for
the
communist
party.
his
refusal
said,
“please
be
advised
that
upon
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
and
at
his
direction
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
hereby
officially
refuse.”
the
attorney
general
had
issued
an
opinion
which
was
also
a
copy
of
which
was
given
to
the
representatives,
in
which
the
attorney
general
said,
“in
view
of
the
federal
statutes
and
quoted
in
full
sections
841
and
842
of
the
communist
control
act,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
you
should
refuse
to
accept
for
filing
the
nominating
petition
in
question.
however,
any
doubts
relative
to
this
matter
can
only
be
finally
resolved
by
the
courts
pursuant
to
appropriate
legal
proceedings.”
the
party
went
to
court.
judge
devitt
convened
the
three-fudge
district
court
and
on
september
30th,
heard
arguments
of
counsel.
following
that
and
inspite
of
a
request
for
a
permanent
injunction,
the
court
ruled
that
a
hurried
decision
would
not
be
appropriate.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
in
the
prayer
for
relief,
we
ask
both
for
a
temporary
and
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
against
the
state
officials
requiring
them
to
place
the
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
in
the
june
'68
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
the
only
injunction
at
that
time.
we
ask
for
such
other
and
further
relief
in
the
prayer
for
relief
and
following
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
injunction
and
the
passage
of
election,
we
noticed
it
for
trial
came
back
to
court
and
found
ourselves
arguing
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
we
amended
our
complaint
and
the
three-judge
court
granted
the
motion
to
amend
the
complaint.
in
the
prayer,
we
said
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
intended
to
participate
in
future
local,
state
and
national
elections.
this
amendment
was
granted
and
it
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
of
mrs.
smith
to
this
effect
on
behalf
of
the
party.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
prayer
was
not
amended.
we
felt
that
under
rule
54(c)
the
request
for
additional
relief
would
incorporate
our
desire
to
obtain
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that's
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct,
although
we
feel
we
were
not
able
to
come
back
to
court
because
of
the
disposition
of
the
motion
of
the
state
to
dismiss
as
moot
to
ask
for
a
permanent
injunction
which
we
feel
we
are
entitled
to
by
this
party.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
did
see
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
feel
that
the
relief
asked
for,
we
did
ask
for
a
permanent
injunction.
we
feel
that
this
is
similar
to
the
moore
v.
ogilvie
case
the
specific
injunction
to
put
them
on
the
ballot
was
not
necessary
after
the
election.
all
that
remained
was
declaratory
relief
which
if
granted
would
have
the
effect
of
an
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
sought
to
enjoin
the
both
by
the
temporary
relief
requested
the
permanent
injunction
and
the
declaratory
relief
to
stop
to
enjoin
the
execution
and
enforcement
of
the
communist
control
act
of
1954.
had
we
obtained
the
declaratory
relief
we
asked
for,
it
would
have
had
the
effect
of
restraining
the
operation
and
enforcement
of
the
act.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
we
could
not
restrain
the
united
states
from
enforcing
the
act
as
against
state
elections
because
the
united
states
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
the
state
elections
in
this
regard.
the
only
state
--
the
only
government
officials
who
have
the
power
to
execute
and
enforce
the
communist
control
act
in
elections
are
the
state
officials.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
we
asked
for
the
relief
which
the
court
held
below
entitled
us
to
a
three-judge
court,
to
restrain
the
state
officials
from
preventing
the
communist
party
from
being
on
the
‘68
ballot.
following
that
election,
we
amended
our
compliant
to
let
the
court
know
that
the
communist
party
intended
to
participate
in
future
elections.
the
next
point
is
that
in
support
of
the
lower
court's
order
dismissing
the
complaint
as
moot,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
the
communist
party
will
continue
to
participate
in
elections
both
on
a
statewide
level
and
on
a
national
level.
the
party
has
participated
in
the
past
in
163
elections,
41
states
have
been
the
site
of
those
elections
and
in
minnesota
there
have
been
27
elections
all
but
one
of
these
have
been
election
contests
for
state
or
national
office.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
made
the
argument
below
that
it
is
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
that
it
is
just
speculative
that
the
party
will
run
for
future
elections
and
he
said
the
earliest
time
that
could
come
up
again
is
1972.
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
time
is
upon
us
now
for
the
party
to
participate
in
other
elections.
we
have
statewide
elections,
we
have
elections
for
united
states
senator
as
well
as
for
the
house
of
representatives
and
if
this
case
is
--
if
the
order
of
the
court
below
is
upheld
as
moot,
the
communist
party
will
have
participated
in
litigation
for
almost
two
years
and
be
in
precisely
the
situation
that
we
argue
such
an
order
would
place
us
that
is
that
we
would
have
to
go
back
into
court
again
and
litigate
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
party
to
appear
on
the
ballot.
the
court
below
refused
to
reach
the
merits
saying
that
a
hurried
decision
would
not
be
wise
or
would
be
unwise.
they
also
wish
the
united
states
to
be
a
party.
chief
judge
devitt
teletyped
the
united
states
attorney,
mr.
ramsey
clark
and
ordered
him
to
appear
on
the
court.
mr.
clark
replied
with
a
letter
saying
that
he
had
other
commitments
and
did
not
appear.
however,
he
sent
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
minnesota
to
appear
amicus
curiae
and
he
did
appear
and
argued
to
the
court
that
the
communist
control
act
does
not
bar
the
party
from
the
ballot
that
it
can
be
interpreted
citing
catherwood
as
for
the
proposition
that
communist
party,
pardon
me,
candidates
could
run
as
long
as
they
didn't
use
the
label
communist
party.
he
also
suggested
to
the
attorney
general
that
minnesota
law
might
allow
the
communist
party
to
appear
on
the
ballot
with
the
designation
communist
party,
an
argument
which
was
not
accepted
by
either
the
court
or
by
the
attorney
general.
i
think
that
that
position
of
the
united
states
fails
because
it
does
not
recognize
that
the
party
itself
under
minnesota
law
has
a
right.
there
are
provisions
in
the
law,
which
allow
a
party
to
present
candidates
if
it
receives
a
percentage
of
votes
and
we
feel
that
a
vote
for
party
enthronement
is
equally
as
important
as
a
vote
for
party
candidates.
the
united
states
in
its
brief
relied
on
salwen
and
rees.
the
only
other
case
construing
the
communist
control
act
in
terms
of
elections
for
the
proposition
that
a
communist
party
candidate
could
run
for
election.
in
that
case
the
new
jersey
courts
as
well
including
the
supreme
court
did
not
accept
even
that
argument
and
said
that
it
would
be
a
keen
way
to
avoid
the
effect
of
the
act
if
communist
party
candidates
could
run
and
hide
from
the
public
or
not
mention
the
fact
that
they
are
espousing
communist
party
principles.
so,
both
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
in
this
case
agree
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
communist
party
--
i'm
sorry
that
the
communist
control
act
bars
the
communist
party
or
its
candidate
from
running
in
elections
whether
or
not
they
disclose
or
speak
to
the
effect
that
they
are
running
under
the
communist
party
label.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
also
--
yes,
we
also
want
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
believe
the
united
states
government
has
had
a
clear
position
over
the
years.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
united
states
has
not
appeared
on
this
case.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
it's
my
understanding
that
the
court
did
not
request
the
appearance
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes.
judge
devitt
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
not
only
gave
statutory
notice
but
teletyped
an
order
requiring
him
to
appear.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
response
to
which
was
the
appearance
of
the
u.s.
attorney
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
one
of
the
points
relied
upon.
the
judge
pointed
out
three
reasons
why
the
cases
was
or
why
the
motion
was
granted
to
dismiss
that
it
was
moot,
that
it
was
not
right
for
adjudication
and
that
there
was
not
an
actual
case
of
controversy
as
required
by
the
declaratory
judge
would
say.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
do
not
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
we
did
not
anticipate
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
amended
because
the
court
granted
the
relief
of
the
party
to
appear
on
that
ballot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
believe
we
do.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
next
secretary
of
state
will
be
elected
in
the
coming
elections?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
but
we
feel
mr.
justice
that
this
case
is
going
to
be
presented
again
before
that
man
leaves
office.
the
filing
date
for
the
national
elections
are
in
july
of
1970.
his
office
does
not
expire
until
november
of
1970.
the
attorney
general
will
be
in
office
until
november
of
1970.
the
party
is
now
seriously
considering
the
state
and
national
elections
in
minnesota.
i
believe
no
candidates
have
filed
although
a
number
are
talking
of
their
intent
to
do
so.
if
this
case
is
dismissed,
if
the
order
dismissing
the
case
is
moot
as
upheld,
the
appellants
are
precisely
in
the
position
they
were
in
the
summer
of
1968
of
having
to
come
back
to
court
again
with
exactly
the
same
defendants
and
waste
the
resources
on
their
time
again
covering
the
same
ground.
moreover,
we
take
the
position
that
the
mere
change
of
the
constitutional
officers
of
the
state
is
not
enough
to
moot
the
case.
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
save
the
one
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
united
states
attorney.
there
is
no
legal
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
act
does
not
apply.
i
can't
imagine
that
a
constitutional
officer
would
take
another
position.
they
cite
the
opinion
of
a
connecticut
attorney
general
ruling
the
same
way
salwen
and
rees
stands
for
not
only
that
proposition
but
to
the
communist
party
candidate
without
his
party
cannot
participate
in
elections
and
the
united
states
failure
to
appear.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
and
the
state
can
continually
present
us
with
the
same
situation.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
there
is.
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
september
30th,
the
court
asked
mr.
kyle
who
at
that
time
was
solicitor
general,
it
is
on
page
18
of
the
appellants
brief.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
and
in
the
appendix
--
on
page
69
of
the
appendix.
the
court
inquired
of
counsel.
on
another
subject
i
noticed
that
counsel's
affidavit
says
on
information
and
belief.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
misspoke.
it
was
at
the
hearing
on
november
25th,
‘68
hearing
arguments
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot
and
on
the
appellant's
motion
to
amend.
this
exchange
took
place.
on
another
subject,
i
noticed
that
counsel's
affidavit
says
on
information
and
belief,
he
has
learned
that
you
or
the
attorney
general
are
going
to
persist
in
your
viewpoint
that
if
some
other
communist
affiliated
people
file,
you
are
going
to
take
the
same
position.
is
there
any
basis
for
this
information
and
belief?
mr.
kyle
replied,
“i
think
there
probably
is.
at
least
there
is
no
new
case
law
which
has
come
down
which
would
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
dictate
a
different
result
ultimately.”
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
mr.
kyle
was
the
solicitor
general
in
the
case
and
he
is
appearing
for
appellees
today.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
he
was
the
--
the
chief
officer
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
he
is
not.
yes,
he
is,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
i
misspoke
i
--
he
did
leave
the
office
of
solicitor
general
who
i
understand
that
came
back
to
it
and
is
presently
serving
that
institution
now.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
they
were
--
in
their
brief
subsequent,
they
did
not
like
the
effect
of
this
admission
in
court
and
argued
in
opposing
the
noting
of
probably
jurisdiction
that
also
tying
to
the
argument
that
this
would
not
be
presented
again
until
1972
that
there
would
be
another
constitutional
officer,
pardon
me,
and
no
way
for
the
court
to
determine
that
the
same
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
they
did
not?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
did
not.
the
united
states,
we
feel,
did
not
appear
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
because
they
have
had
a
long
standing
provision
that
such
an
act
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
1948,
when
congress
was
considering
and
the
year
subsequent
a
number
of
bills
which
would
have
barred
the
communist
party
from
activity,
two
congressional
subcommittees
were
holding
hearings
on
legislation
aimed
at
restricting
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
one
bill
would
have
banned
from
the
ballot
and
any
election
in
the
united
states
all
political
parties
directly
or
indirectly
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
after
the
bills'
constitutionality
was
assailed
by
a
number
of
witnesses,
the
committee
recessed
to
await
an
opinion
from
the
department
of
justice
on
this
subject.
the
opinion
was
forthcoming
in
a
letter
on
march
9,
1948
to
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
house
administration
that
letter
said
and
i
quote,
“although
this
department
is
in
complete
sympathy
of
course
with
the
desire
that
no
subversive
or
disloyal
person
should
be
permitted
to
hold
a
position
of
honor,
trust,
or
profit
in
the
government,
it
is
believed
that
the
bill
under
consideration
will
be
of
doubtful
validity
and
enforceability
for
many
reasons.
the
most
outstanding
of
which
is
that
it
might
be
regarded
as
in
the
nature
of
bill
of
attainder,
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
and
an
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
legislate
insofar
as
it
would
apply
to
the
qualifications
of
a
political
party
in
any
election
in
a
field
for
which
no
federal
authority
exists.
the
united
states
has
not
in
any
case
that
we
can
find
moved
from
this
position.
we
believe
that
this
position
has
been
consistent
regardless
of
the
change
of
constitutional
officers.
we
believe
also
that
any
state
official
with
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
is
today
would
be
the
same
as
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
in
this
case.
we
urge
the
court
and
feel
the
court
has
authority
to
issue
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
state
officials
from
preventing
minnesota
candidates,
from
minnesota
communist
party
candidates,
from
presenting
their
nominating
petitions
and
participating
in
elections.
we
feel
the
court
should
reach
the
merits
of
constitutionality
that
the
argument
of
the
act
does
not
apply
is
without
merit
and
is
not
relied
by
legislative
history.
there
was
little
agreement
on
the
extent
of
the
scope
of
this
act
in
the
legislative
debates
as
few
as
they
were,
but
there
was
agreement
on
one
thing
that
this
act
barred
the
party
from
the
ballot
and
the
authorities
that
have
studied
and
written
about
this
act
subsequent
to
its
passage
have
agreed
that
the
act
has
this
effect.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
being
the
department
of
justice
or
the
legislative
debates.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
oh,
the
appellees
in
case
have
not
denied
that
the
act
applies
and
let
me
take
this
opportunity,
thank
you
for
reminding
me,
there
is
an
error
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
page
45.
on
the
first
paragraph
of
page
45,
the
second
sentence
says,
“both
the
attorney
general
and
the
u.s.
attorney
argued
below
that
the
communist
control
act
infringes
upon
the
power
of
the
states
in
this
regard
that
is
to
qualify
electors.”
the
inclusion
of
the
minnesota
attorney
general
should
not
be
there,
this
was
an
error.
turning
to
the
merits,
we
urge
the
court
to
find
the
act
unconstitutional
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
we
believe
the
act
is
a
classical
bill
of
attainder
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
all
who
sat
on
this
court
considering
the
cases
of
attainder
would
find
this
act
a
classical
bill
of
attainder.
first,
the
act
outlaws
the
communist
party
by
legislative
fiat.
the
party
itself
was
outlawed
in
this
case
in
the
sacb
case.
i'm
sorry,
this
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
if
the
party
by
name
were
outlawed,
the
act
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
made
this
finding.
the
second
test
is
whether
there
is
a
legislative
finding
of
guilt.
in
841
there
is
the
flat
conclusion
that
the
communist
party
should
be
outlawed
and
in
841
also,
in
fact
an
instrumentality
of
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
legislative
finding
of
guilt
taking
away
from
the
power
of
the
court
to
make
determination
not
granting
a
hearing
to
the
party
on
its
conclusions
and
we
urge
that
the
position
of
the
appellees
that
this
court
may
take
into
consideration
the
legislative
findings
in
other
and
not
related
acts
as
to
the
nature
of
a
communist
party
cannot
support
this
act.
we
feel
that's
a
novel
assertion
that
the
findings
of
one
act
can
be
held
to
support
another.
this
act
was
adopted
on
the
eve
of
adjournment
in
1954,
there
were
no
committee
hearings
on
the
act
saved
congressman
dice,
the
legislative
history
has
been
properly
described
by
this
court
in
the
catherwood
case
has
given
little
guidance.
the
third
test,
we
feel,
is
met
as
if
the
party
is
punished.
there
is
no
comparable
example
of
such
a
flat
legislative
finding
of
guilt
in
the
absence
of
a
judicial
trial
and
the
cases
of
this
court
going
back
to
the
post
civil
war
bill
of
attainder
cases
cummings
and
garland
clearly
show
that
punishment
need
not
be
imprisonment
but
in
fact
point
out
specific
--
in
specific
example
precisely
what
has
happened
under
this
act
that
the
party
is
barred
from
the
ballot.
the
fourth
test
and
one
which
this
court
which
many
authorities
feel
this
court
has
set
forth
in
dallas
is
also
met.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
party
to
reform
itself.
it
cannot
escape
the
provisions
of
this
act.
nothing
it
does
can
allow
it
to
come
to
the
ballot
and
in
fact,
the
interpretations
of
the
act
do
not
allow
an
individual
candidate
supporting
the
principles
of
the
party
to
appear
without
party
endorsement.
the
second
provision
and
there
are
many
or
the
second
of
unconstitutionality
and
one
which
we
feel
is
in
equal
weight
is
the
infringement
upon
freedom
of
speech.
this
court
in
the
last
term
in
williams
and
rhodes
made
it
clear
with
the
right
vote
and
first
amendment
protects
that
right
both
for
the
right
of
qualified
voters
to
cast
their
votes
as
well
as
the
right
of
individuals
to
associate
with
a
party
or
an
association
to
cast
their
votes.
the
state
would
urge
that
the
paltry
showing
of
the
party
in
the
last
election,
415
votes,
would
minimize
the
importance
of
participation
in
the
electoral
process.
we
feel
that
cannot
be
serious
in
this
regard.
the
real
importance
and
contribution
to
participation
in
the
political
process
is
the
forum
of
an
electoral
contest
as
freedom
of
speech.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
freedom
of
speech
is
on
the
highest
of
scale
of
constitutional
liberties
and
we
feel
the
court
has
also
made
it
clear
that
the
right
to
vote
is
at
the
top
with
it.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well
they
pointed
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
argued
this
in
terms
of
its
being
moot,
that
is
with
such
a
paltry
showing
how
can
we
expect
that
the
party
would
make
another
serious
attempt
and
have
ignored
the
fact
of
163
elections
of
this
party.
they
also
have
pointed
to
the
hiatus
of
participation
in
electoral
politics
by
the
party
from
1950
until
the
1968
election
and
this
lack
of
participation
was
not
due
to
a
lack
in
interest
but
to
the
effect
of
the
mccarran
act.
the
party
itself
has
come
back
into
electoral
politics
in
1968.
they
did
participate
in
local
elections
in
new
york,
rashid
storey
and
jesus
colon
ran
for
mayor
and
the
comptroller.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
what?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
on
the
merits
they
merely
say
that
to
balance
the
interests
of
taking
the
risk
that
a
party
if
elected
would
destroy
our
way
of
government.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
415
in
minnesota.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
believe
it
is
about
3
million.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
am
afraid
they'll
have
to
answer
that
for
themselves.
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
believe
the
state
will
spend
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it
and
i
will
respond
in
rebuttal.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
would
like
to
speak
first
of
the
question
of
1253
jurisdiction.
appellants
urge
that
the
goldstein
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
goldstein
said
that
the
only
interlocutory
orders
which
the
court
has
power
to
review
under
1253
are
orders
granting
or
denying
preliminary
injunctions.
we
do
not
ask
what
the
order
did
not
deny
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
order
of
july
of
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
was
a
final
order.
we
feel
this
is
similar
to
moore
and
a
number
of
other
cases
where
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
though
quite
previously
asked
for
has
evaporated.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
right.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
asked
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
original
injunction
that
we
asked
for
was
a
permanent
injunction
prior
to
the
election.
this
injunction
was
denied
by
the
court
issuing
a
final
order
saying
the
case
was
moot
and
that
there
was
not
an
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
it
was
one
of
three
types
of
injunctions
we
asked
for.
we
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
which
was
denied,
for
a
temporary
injunction
which
was
granted,
and
for
a
permanent
injunction
which
was
not
granted.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
prior
to
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
--
of
the
appendix.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
court
issues
a
permanent
injunction
requiring
the
defendant
secretary
of
state
joseph
donovan
to
accept
and
file
the
petition
for
nomination
as
required
by
the
statutes
and
required
that
donovan
include
upon
the
ballot
the
names
of
mitchell
and
zagarell.
the
permanent
injunction
we
asked
for,
we
urge
is
the
only
relief
we
could
have
asked
for
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
what
we
asked
for
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
did
not.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
amended
the
complaint
and
we
feel
that
rule
54
is
broad
enough
and
clear
that
for
such
other
and
further
relief
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
are
at
this
court
to
issue
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
and
at
that
point
in
time
the
issues
before
them
were
a
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
characterizes
the
nature
of
relief
as
asking
for
declaratory
relief.
we
urge
that
once
a
three-judge
court
has
properly
convened
and
has
jurisdiction
and
we
feel
the
three
judges
below
properly
decided
they
had
jurisdiction
under
1983
that
once
the
need
for
the
immediate
injunctive
relief
passes
that
declaratory
relief
is
sufficient
to
continue
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court.
we
feel
this
was
the
situation
in
moore
v.
ogelvie.
it
was
the
situation
in
zwickler
and
koota
and
in
that
case
the
fact
that
it
was
moot
is
a
separate
issue
from
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court.
in
zwickler,
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
had
passed
and
the
court,
this
court
accepted
jurisdiction
on
the
remaining
declaratory
relief.
we
also
feel
there
was
no
need
although
we
did
ask
for
injunctive
relief,
there
are
cases
which
support
the
proposition
that
reached
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct,
we
feel
more
and
ogelvie
stands
for
the
same
proposition.
as
to
the
question
of
case
or
controversy,
we
feel
that
the
three
cases
cited
to
this
court
and
discussed
brockington
and
rhodes,
hall
and
beals,
and
golden
versus
zwickler
are
not
applicable
to
our
case.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
it
is.
in
that
case,
this
court
mooted
the
case
because
the
colorado
legislature
had
amended
the
statute
after
review,
i'm
sorry,
amended
the
statute
under
review
after
the
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
in
brockington,
the
case
was
moot
because
the
petitioner
had
requested
only
mandamus,
which
could
not
be
granted
after
the
election
and
he
did
not
alleged
that
he
intended
to
run
for
office
in
the
future.
he
did
not
sue
for
himself
and
others
similarly
situated.
it
was
not
class
action
as
this
is.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
did
not.
we
feel
that
if
--
have
judge
devitt
and
the
three-judge
court
ruled
that
dissolved
and
found
no
jurisdiction.
well,
we
feel
then
the
proper
remedy
was
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
three-judge
court
did
not
disturb
the
jurisdiction
in
the
original
case
and
only
dismissed
the
case
because
of
want
of
an
actual
controversy.
in
an
election
situation,
which
we
feel
is
unique,
we
are
in
round-robin
of
going
to
the
court,
having
the
election
passed
and
then
coming
back
down
to
the
lower
court
and
raising
the
same
issues
in
the
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
they
refused
to
reach
the
merits
because
of
a
want
of
an
actual
controversy.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
but
we
disagree
as
to
the
effect
of
that
type
of
relief.
we
feel
this
court
does
have
in
an
election
situation
of
a
1253
jurisdiction
to
review.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
let
me
make
one
or
two
more
points.
a
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
it
would
be
required
by
us
to
have
a
future
--
a
class
action
alleging
future
elections.
we
feel
that
this
would
be
an
unfair
requirement
to
ask
a
party
to
pick
candidates
in
the
future
to
run
for
elections
to
show
that
there
is
an
actual
controversy
or
that
they
intend
to
run
for
elections.
the
communist
party
itself,
the
political
party,
is
an
appellant
in
this
case
and
the
party
has
maintained
that
it
will
run
for
future
elections.
we
don't
feel
that
it
need
be
required
to
pick
particular
candidates
for
elections.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
one
last
point,
we
feel
that
the
question
of
granting
of
declaratory
relief
after
the
need
for
an
injunction
is
passed
is
founded
in
the
number
of
decisions.
united
states
v.
149
gift
packages,
the
court
considered
a
case
of
libel
against
gift
packages
by
the
government
alleging
them
to
be
misbranded.
the
answer
did
not
deny
misbranding
but
filed
a
counterclaim
which
attacked
the
statute
as
unconstitutional.
in
that
case,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
declaratory
relief
was
granted
after
the
necessity
for
injunctive
relief
had
passed
and
the
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
was
sustained.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellants
in
this
case
are
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america,
communist
party
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
mrs.
charlene
mitchell
and
mr.
michael
zagerell,
1968
communist
party
presidential
and
vice
presidential
candidates,
mrs.
betty
smith
state
secretary
of
the
minnesota
communist
party,
10
presidential
electors
from
the
state
of
minnesota
for
the
communist
party,
two
plaintiff
appellees
representing
the
2,394
registered
voters
who
signed
a
petition
to
put
the
communist
party
candidates
on
the
1968
ballot
and
one
registered
voter
who
did
not
sign
the
petition.
the
communist
party
of
the
state
of
minnesota
as
well
as
the
national
party
are
unincorporated
associations.
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
held
a
duly
convened
statewide
convention
in
minnesota
on
or
about
june
23,
1968.
they
elected
six
delegates
and
an
alternate
delegate
to
the
national
convention
of
the
communist
party
u.s.a,
which
was
called
for
and
held
in
new
york,
july
4
to
july
7,
1968.
at
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
convention,
a
motion
was
passed
that
if
the
communist
party
u.s.a
nominated
a
presidential
ticket
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
would
endeavor
to
place
on
the
ballot
in
minnesota
those
candidates.
mrs.
betty
smith
attended
that
convention
as
a
delegate
in
new
york.
mrs.
mitchell
and
mr.
zagerell
were
duly
nominated
by
that
convention
immediately
following
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
mounted
a
campaign
to
obtain
the
requisite
number
of
signatures,
under
minnesota
law,
2000
to
place
the
candidates
on
the
ballot.
on
this
nominating
petition
appeared
the
name
of
the
ten
communist
presidential
electors
and
under
minnesota
law
on
the
ballot
only
appears
the
name
of
the
candidates
and
by
minnesota
law,
a
vote
for
the
candidates
is
a
vote
for
those
electors.
on
sunday,
september
8,
the
party
completed
its
campaign
to
collect
signatures.
on
the
next
day,
monday
the
9th,
representatives
of
the
communist
party,
the
national
office
as
well
as
the
state
appeared
at
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
of
minnesota
joseph
donovan
to
file
the
nominating
petition.
the
party
representatives
arrived
at
the
secretary
of
state's
office
during
the
noon
hour.
immediately
after
noon,
they
tendered
their
petition.
this
petition
was
anticipated
and
they
were
presented
a
written
refusal
of
the
secretary
of
state.
he
did
examine
the
contents
of
the
package
and
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
the
nominating
petition
for
the
communist
party.
his
refusal
said,
“please
be
advised
that
upon
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
and
at
his
direction
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
hereby
officially
refuse.”
the
attorney
general
had
issued
an
opinion
which
was
also
a
copy
of
which
was
given
to
the
representatives,
in
which
the
attorney
general
said,
“in
view
of
the
federal
statutes
and
quoted
in
full
sections
841
and
842
of
the
communist
control
act,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
you
should
refuse
to
accept
for
filing
the
nominating
petition
in
question.
however,
any
doubts
relative
to
this
matter
can
only
be
finally
resolved
by
the
courts
pursuant
to
appropriate
legal
proceedings.”
the
party
went
to
court.
judge
devitt
convened
the
three-fudge
district
court
and
on
september
30th,
heard
arguments
of
counsel.
following
that
and
inspite
of
a
request
for
a
permanent
injunction,
the
court
ruled
that
a
hurried
decision
would
not
be
appropriate.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
in
the
prayer
for
relief,
we
ask
both
for
a
temporary
and
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
against
the
state
officials
requiring
them
to
place
the
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
in
the
june
'68
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
the
only
injunction
at
that
time.
we
ask
for
such
other
and
further
relief
in
the
prayer
for
relief
and
following
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
injunction
and
the
passage
of
election,
we
noticed
it
for
trial
came
back
to
court
and
found
ourselves
arguing
a
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
we
amended
our
complaint
and
the
three-judge
court
granted
the
motion
to
amend
the
complaint.
in
the
prayer,
we
said
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
intended
to
participate
in
future
local,
state
and
national
elections.
this
amendment
was
granted
and
it
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
of
mrs.
smith
to
this
effect
on
behalf
of
the
party.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
prayer
was
not
amended.
we
felt
that
under
rule
54(c)
the
request
for
additional
relief
would
incorporate
our
desire
to
obtain
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that's
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct,
although
we
feel
we
were
not
able
to
come
back
to
court
because
of
the
disposition
of
the
motion
of
the
state
to
dismiss
as
moot
to
ask
for
a
permanent
injunction
which
we
feel
we
are
entitled
to
by
this
party.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
did
see
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
feel
that
the
relief
asked
for,
we
did
ask
for
a
permanent
injunction.
we
feel
that
this
is
similar
to
the
moore
v.
ogilvie
case
the
specific
injunction
to
put
them
on
the
ballot
was
not
necessary
after
the
election.
all
that
remained
was
declaratory
relief
which
if
granted
would
have
the
effect
of
an
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
sought
to
enjoin
the
both
by
the
temporary
relief
requested
the
permanent
injunction
and
the
declaratory
relief
to
stop
to
enjoin
the
execution
and
enforcement
of
the
communist
control
act
of
1954.
had
we
obtained
the
declaratory
relief
we
asked
for,
it
would
have
had
the
effect
of
restraining
the
operation
and
enforcement
of
the
act.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
united
states
is
not
a
party.
we
could
not
restrain
the
united
states
from
enforcing
the
act
as
against
state
elections
because
the
united
states
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
the
state
elections
in
this
regard.
the
only
state
--
the
only
government
officials
who
have
the
power
to
execute
and
enforce
the
communist
control
act
in
elections
are
the
state
officials.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
we
asked
for
the
relief
which
the
court
held
below
entitled
us
to
a
three-judge
court,
to
restrain
the
state
officials
from
preventing
the
communist
party
from
being
on
the
‘68
ballot.
following
that
election,
we
amended
our
compliant
to
let
the
court
know
that
the
communist
party
intended
to
participate
in
future
elections.
the
next
point
is
that
in
support
of
the
lower
court's
order
dismissing
the
complaint
as
moot,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
the
communist
party
will
continue
to
participate
in
elections
both
on
a
statewide
level
and
on
a
national
level.
the
party
has
participated
in
the
past
in
163
elections,
41
states
have
been
the
site
of
those
elections
and
in
minnesota
there
have
been
27
elections
all
but
one
of
these
have
been
election
contests
for
state
or
national
office.
now,
the
attorney
general
has
made
the
argument
below
that
it
is
and
this
was
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
that
it
is
just
speculative
that
the
party
will
run
for
future
elections
and
he
said
the
earliest
time
that
could
come
up
again
is
1972.
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
time
is
upon
us
now
for
the
party
to
participate
in
other
elections.
we
have
statewide
elections,
we
have
elections
for
united
states
senator
as
well
as
for
the
house
of
representatives
and
if
this
case
is
--
if
the
order
of
the
court
below
is
upheld
as
moot,
the
communist
party
will
have
participated
in
litigation
for
almost
two
years
and
be
in
precisely
the
situation
that
we
argue
such
an
order
would
place
us
that
is
that
we
would
have
to
go
back
into
court
again
and
litigate
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
party
to
appear
on
the
ballot.
the
court
below
refused
to
reach
the
merits
saying
that
a
hurried
decision
would
not
be
wise
or
would
be
unwise.
they
also
wish
the
united
states
to
be
a
party.
chief
judge
devitt
teletyped
the
united
states
attorney,
mr.
ramsey
clark
and
ordered
him
to
appear
on
the
court.
mr.
clark
replied
with
a
letter
saying
that
he
had
other
commitments
and
did
not
appear.
however,
he
sent
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
minnesota
to
appear
amicus
curiae
and
he
did
appear
and
argued
to
the
court
that
the
communist
control
act
does
not
bar
the
party
from
the
ballot
that
it
can
be
interpreted
citing
catherwood
as
for
the
proposition
that
communist
party,
pardon
me,
candidates
could
run
as
long
as
they
didn't
use
the
label
communist
party.
he
also
suggested
to
the
attorney
general
that
minnesota
law
might
allow
the
communist
party
to
appear
on
the
ballot
with
the
designation
communist
party,
an
argument
which
was
not
accepted
by
either
the
court
or
by
the
attorney
general.
i
think
that
that
position
of
the
united
states
fails
because
it
does
not
recognize
that
the
party
itself
under
minnesota
law
has
a
right.
there
are
provisions
in
the
law,
which
allow
a
party
to
present
candidates
if
it
receives
a
percentage
of
votes
and
we
feel
that
a
vote
for
party
enthronement
is
equally
as
important
as
a
vote
for
party
candidates.
the
united
states
in
its
brief
relied
on
salwen
and
rees.
the
only
other
case
construing
the
communist
control
act
in
terms
of
elections
for
the
proposition
that
a
communist
party
candidate
could
run
for
election.
in
that
case
the
new
jersey
courts
as
well
including
the
supreme
court
did
not
accept
even
that
argument
and
said
that
it
would
be
a
keen
way
to
avoid
the
effect
of
the
act
if
communist
party
candidates
could
run
and
hide
from
the
public
or
not
mention
the
fact
that
they
are
espousing
communist
party
principles.
so,
both
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
in
this
case
agree
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
communist
party
--
i'm
sorry
that
the
communist
control
act
bars
the
communist
party
or
its
candidate
from
running
in
elections
whether
or
not
they
disclose
or
speak
to
the
effect
that
they
are
running
under
the
communist
party
label.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
also
--
yes,
we
also
want
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
believe
the
united
states
government
has
had
a
clear
position
over
the
years.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
united
states
has
not
appeared
on
this
case.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
it's
my
understanding
that
the
court
did
not
request
the
appearance
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes.
judge
devitt
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
not
only
gave
statutory
notice
but
teletyped
an
order
requiring
him
to
appear.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
response
to
which
was
the
appearance
of
the
u.s.
attorney
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
one
of
the
points
relied
upon.
the
judge
pointed
out
three
reasons
why
the
cases
was
or
why
the
motion
was
granted
to
dismiss
that
it
was
moot,
that
it
was
not
right
for
adjudication
and
that
there
was
not
an
actual
case
of
controversy
as
required
by
the
declaratory
judge
would
say.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
do
not
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
we
did
not
anticipate
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
amended
because
the
court
granted
the
relief
of
the
party
to
appear
on
that
ballot.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
believe
we
do.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
next
secretary
of
state
will
be
elected
in
the
coming
elections?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
but
we
feel
mr.
justice
that
this
case
is
going
to
be
presented
again
before
that
man
leaves
office.
the
filing
date
for
the
national
elections
are
in
july
of
1970.
his
office
does
not
expire
until
november
of
1970.
the
attorney
general
will
be
in
office
until
november
of
1970.
the
party
is
now
seriously
considering
the
state
and
national
elections
in
minnesota.
i
believe
no
candidates
have
filed
although
a
number
are
talking
of
their
intent
to
do
so.
if
this
case
is
dismissed,
if
the
order
dismissing
the
case
is
moot
as
upheld,
the
appellants
are
precisely
in
the
position
they
were
in
the
summer
of
1968
of
having
to
come
back
to
court
again
with
exactly
the
same
defendants
and
waste
the
resources
on
their
time
again
covering
the
same
ground.
moreover,
we
take
the
position
that
the
mere
change
of
the
constitutional
officers
of
the
state
is
not
enough
to
moot
the
case.
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
save
the
one
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
united
states
attorney.
there
is
no
legal
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
act
does
not
apply.
i
can't
imagine
that
a
constitutional
officer
would
take
another
position.
they
cite
the
opinion
of
a
connecticut
attorney
general
ruling
the
same
way
salwen
and
rees
stands
for
not
only
that
proposition
but
to
the
communist
party
candidate
without
his
party
cannot
participate
in
elections
and
the
united
states
failure
to
appear.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
and
the
state
can
continually
present
us
with
the
same
situation.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
there
is.
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
september
30th,
the
court
asked
mr.
kyle
who
at
that
time
was
solicitor
general,
it
is
on
page
18
of
the
appellants
brief.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
and
in
the
appendix
--
on
page
69
of
the
appendix.
the
court
inquired
of
counsel.
on
another
subject
i
noticed
that
counsel's
affidavit
says
on
information
and
belief.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
misspoke.
it
was
at
the
hearing
on
november
25th,
‘68
hearing
arguments
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot
and
on
the
appellant's
motion
to
amend.
this
exchange
took
place.
on
another
subject,
i
noticed
that
counsel's
affidavit
says
on
information
and
belief,
he
has
learned
that
you
or
the
attorney
general
are
going
to
persist
in
your
viewpoint
that
if
some
other
communist
affiliated
people
file,
you
are
going
to
take
the
same
position.
is
there
any
basis
for
this
information
and
belief?
mr.
kyle
replied,
“i
think
there
probably
is.
at
least
there
is
no
new
case
law
which
has
come
down
which
would
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
dictate
a
different
result
ultimately.”
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
mr.
kyle
was
the
solicitor
general
in
the
case
and
he
is
appearing
for
appellees
today.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
he
was
the
--
the
chief
officer
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
he
is
not.
yes,
he
is,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
i
misspoke
i
--
he
did
leave
the
office
of
solicitor
general
who
i
understand
that
came
back
to
it
and
is
presently
serving
that
institution
now.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well,
they
were
--
in
their
brief
subsequent,
they
did
not
like
the
effect
of
this
admission
in
court
and
argued
in
opposing
the
noting
of
probably
jurisdiction
that
also
tying
to
the
argument
that
this
would
not
be
presented
again
until
1972
that
there
would
be
another
constitutional
officer,
pardon
me,
and
no
way
for
the
court
to
determine
that
the
same
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
they
did
not?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
did
not.
the
united
states,
we
feel,
did
not
appear
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
because
they
have
had
a
long
standing
provision
that
such
an
act
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
1948,
when
congress
was
considering
and
the
year
subsequent
a
number
of
bills
which
would
have
barred
the
communist
party
from
activity,
two
congressional
subcommittees
were
holding
hearings
on
legislation
aimed
at
restricting
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
one
bill
would
have
banned
from
the
ballot
and
any
election
in
the
united
states
all
political
parties
directly
or
indirectly
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
after
the
bills'
constitutionality
was
assailed
by
a
number
of
witnesses,
the
committee
recessed
to
await
an
opinion
from
the
department
of
justice
on
this
subject.
the
opinion
was
forthcoming
in
a
letter
on
march
9,
1948
to
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
house
administration
that
letter
said
and
i
quote,
“although
this
department
is
in
complete
sympathy
of
course
with
the
desire
that
no
subversive
or
disloyal
person
should
be
permitted
to
hold
a
position
of
honor,
trust,
or
profit
in
the
government,
it
is
believed
that
the
bill
under
consideration
will
be
of
doubtful
validity
and
enforceability
for
many
reasons.
the
most
outstanding
of
which
is
that
it
might
be
regarded
as
in
the
nature
of
bill
of
attainder,
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
and
an
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
legislate
insofar
as
it
would
apply
to
the
qualifications
of
a
political
party
in
any
election
in
a
field
for
which
no
federal
authority
exists.
the
united
states
has
not
in
any
case
that
we
can
find
moved
from
this
position.
we
believe
that
this
position
has
been
consistent
regardless
of
the
change
of
constitutional
officers.
we
believe
also
that
any
state
official
with
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
is
today
would
be
the
same
as
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
in
this
case.
we
urge
the
court
and
feel
the
court
has
authority
to
issue
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
state
officials
from
preventing
minnesota
candidates,
from
minnesota
communist
party
candidates,
from
presenting
their
nominating
petitions
and
participating
in
elections.
we
feel
the
court
should
reach
the
merits
of
constitutionality
that
the
argument
of
the
act
does
not
apply
is
without
merit
and
is
not
relied
by
legislative
history.
there
was
little
agreement
on
the
extent
of
the
scope
of
this
act
in
the
legislative
debates
as
few
as
they
were,
but
there
was
agreement
on
one
thing
that
this
act
barred
the
party
from
the
ballot
and
the
authorities
that
have
studied
and
written
about
this
act
subsequent
to
its
passage
have
agreed
that
the
act
has
this
effect.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
being
the
department
of
justice
or
the
legislative
debates.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
oh,
the
appellees
in
case
have
not
denied
that
the
act
applies
and
let
me
take
this
opportunity,
thank
you
for
reminding
me,
there
is
an
error
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
page
45.
on
the
first
paragraph
of
page
45,
the
second
sentence
says,
“both
the
attorney
general
and
the
u.s.
attorney
argued
below
that
the
communist
control
act
infringes
upon
the
power
of
the
states
in
this
regard
that
is
to
qualify
electors.”
the
inclusion
of
the
minnesota
attorney
general
should
not
be
there,
this
was
an
error.
turning
to
the
merits,
we
urge
the
court
to
find
the
act
unconstitutional
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
we
believe
the
act
is
a
classical
bill
of
attainder
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
all
who
sat
on
this
court
considering
the
cases
of
attainder
would
find
this
act
a
classical
bill
of
attainder.
first,
the
act
outlaws
the
communist
party
by
legislative
fiat.
the
party
itself
was
outlawed
in
this
case
in
the
sacb
case.
i'm
sorry,
this
court
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
if
the
party
by
name
were
outlawed,
the
act
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
made
this
finding.
the
second
test
is
whether
there
is
a
legislative
finding
of
guilt.
in
841
there
is
the
flat
conclusion
that
the
communist
party
should
be
outlawed
and
in
841
also,
in
fact
an
instrumentality
of
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
there
is
a
legislative
finding
of
guilt
taking
away
from
the
power
of
the
court
to
make
determination
not
granting
a
hearing
to
the
party
on
its
conclusions
and
we
urge
that
the
position
of
the
appellees
that
this
court
may
take
into
consideration
the
legislative
findings
in
other
and
not
related
acts
as
to
the
nature
of
a
communist
party
cannot
support
this
act.
we
feel
that's
a
novel
assertion
that
the
findings
of
one
act
can
be
held
to
support
another.
this
act
was
adopted
on
the
eve
of
adjournment
in
1954,
there
were
no
committee
hearings
on
the
act
saved
congressman
dice,
the
legislative
history
has
been
properly
described
by
this
court
in
the
catherwood
case
has
given
little
guidance.
the
third
test,
we
feel,
is
met
as
if
the
party
is
punished.
there
is
no
comparable
example
of
such
a
flat
legislative
finding
of
guilt
in
the
absence
of
a
judicial
trial
and
the
cases
of
this
court
going
back
to
the
post
civil
war
bill
of
attainder
cases
cummings
and
garland
clearly
show
that
punishment
need
not
be
imprisonment
but
in
fact
point
out
specific
--
in
specific
example
precisely
what
has
happened
under
this
act
that
the
party
is
barred
from
the
ballot.
the
fourth
test
and
one
which
this
court
which
many
authorities
feel
this
court
has
set
forth
in
dallas
is
also
met.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
party
to
reform
itself.
it
cannot
escape
the
provisions
of
this
act.
nothing
it
does
can
allow
it
to
come
to
the
ballot
and
in
fact,
the
interpretations
of
the
act
do
not
allow
an
individual
candidate
supporting
the
principles
of
the
party
to
appear
without
party
endorsement.
the
second
provision
and
there
are
many
or
the
second
of
unconstitutionality
and
one
which
we
feel
is
in
equal
weight
is
the
infringement
upon
freedom
of
speech.
this
court
in
the
last
term
in
williams
and
rhodes
made
it
clear
with
the
right
vote
and
first
amendment
protects
that
right
both
for
the
right
of
qualified
voters
to
cast
their
votes
as
well
as
the
right
of
individuals
to
associate
with
a
party
or
an
association
to
cast
their
votes.
the
state
would
urge
that
the
paltry
showing
of
the
party
in
the
last
election,
415
votes,
would
minimize
the
importance
of
participation
in
the
electoral
process.
we
feel
that
cannot
be
serious
in
this
regard.
the
real
importance
and
contribution
to
participation
in
the
political
process
is
the
forum
of
an
electoral
contest
as
freedom
of
speech.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
freedom
of
speech
is
on
the
highest
of
scale
of
constitutional
liberties
and
we
feel
the
court
has
also
made
it
clear
that
the
right
to
vote
is
at
the
top
with
it.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
well
they
pointed
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
they
argued
this
in
terms
of
its
being
moot,
that
is
with
such
a
paltry
showing
how
can
we
expect
that
the
party
would
make
another
serious
attempt
and
have
ignored
the
fact
of
163
elections
of
this
party.
they
also
have
pointed
to
the
hiatus
of
participation
in
electoral
politics
by
the
party
from
1950
until
the
1968
election
and
this
lack
of
participation
was
not
due
to
a
lack
in
interest
but
to
the
effect
of
the
mccarran
act.
the
party
itself
has
come
back
into
electoral
politics
in
1968.
they
did
participate
in
local
elections
in
new
york,
rashid
storey
and
jesus
colon
ran
for
mayor
and
the
comptroller.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
what?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
on
the
merits
they
merely
say
that
to
balance
the
interests
of
taking
the
risk
that
a
party
if
elected
would
destroy
our
way
of
government.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
415
in
minnesota.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
believe
it
is
about
3
million.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
am
afraid
they'll
have
to
answer
that
for
themselves.
i
will
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
believe
the
state
will
spend
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it
and
i
will
respond
in
rebuttal.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
i
would
like
to
speak
first
of
the
question
of
1253
jurisdiction.
appellants
urge
that
the
goldstein
case
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
goldstein
said
that
the
only
interlocutory
orders
which
the
court
has
power
to
review
under
1253
are
orders
granting
or
denying
preliminary
injunctions.
we
do
not
ask
what
the
order
did
not
deny
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
order
of
july
of
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
was
a
final
order.
we
feel
this
is
similar
to
moore
and
a
number
of
other
cases
where
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
though
quite
previously
asked
for
has
evaporated.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
right.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
asked
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
original
injunction
that
we
asked
for
was
a
permanent
injunction
prior
to
the
election.
this
injunction
was
denied
by
the
court
issuing
a
final
order
saying
the
case
was
moot
and
that
there
was
not
an
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
it
was
one
of
three
types
of
injunctions
we
asked
for.
we
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
which
was
denied,
for
a
temporary
injunction
which
was
granted,
and
for
a
permanent
injunction
which
was
not
granted.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
prior
to
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
--
of
the
appendix.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
the
court
issues
a
permanent
injunction
requiring
the
defendant
secretary
of
state
joseph
donovan
to
accept
and
file
the
petition
for
nomination
as
required
by
the
statutes
and
required
that
donovan
include
upon
the
ballot
the
names
of
mitchell
and
zagarell.
the
permanent
injunction
we
asked
for,
we
urge
is
the
only
relief
we
could
have
asked
for
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
what
we
asked
for
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
did
not.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
amended
the
complaint
and
we
feel
that
rule
54
is
broad
enough
and
clear
that
for
such
other
and
further
relief
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
we
are
at
this
court
to
issue
the
permanent
injunction.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
and
at
that
point
in
time
the
issues
before
them
were
a
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
characterizes
the
nature
of
relief
as
asking
for
declaratory
relief.
we
urge
that
once
a
three-judge
court
has
properly
convened
and
has
jurisdiction
and
we
feel
the
three
judges
below
properly
decided
they
had
jurisdiction
under
1983
that
once
the
need
for
the
immediate
injunctive
relief
passes
that
declaratory
relief
is
sufficient
to
continue
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court.
we
feel
this
was
the
situation
in
moore
v.
ogelvie.
it
was
the
situation
in
zwickler
and
koota
and
in
that
case
the
fact
that
it
was
moot
is
a
separate
issue
from
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court.
in
zwickler,
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
had
passed
and
the
court,
this
court
accepted
jurisdiction
on
the
remaining
declaratory
relief.
we
also
feel
there
was
no
need
although
we
did
ask
for
injunctive
relief,
there
are
cases
which
support
the
proposition
that
reached
--
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct,
we
feel
more
and
ogelvie
stands
for
the
same
proposition.
as
to
the
question
of
case
or
controversy,
we
feel
that
the
three
cases
cited
to
this
court
and
discussed
brockington
and
rhodes,
hall
and
beals,
and
golden
versus
zwickler
are
not
applicable
to
our
case.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
yes,
it
is.
in
that
case,
this
court
mooted
the
case
because
the
colorado
legislature
had
amended
the
statute
after
review,
i'm
sorry,
amended
the
statute
under
review
after
the
court
had
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
in
brockington,
the
case
was
moot
because
the
petitioner
had
requested
only
mandamus,
which
could
not
be
granted
after
the
election
and
he
did
not
alleged
that
he
intended
to
run
for
office
in
the
future.
he
did
not
sue
for
himself
and
others
similarly
situated.
it
was
not
class
action
as
this
is.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
did
not.
we
feel
that
if
--
have
judge
devitt
and
the
three-judge
court
ruled
that
dissolved
and
found
no
jurisdiction.
well,
we
feel
then
the
proper
remedy
was
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
three-judge
court
did
not
disturb
the
jurisdiction
in
the
original
case
and
only
dismissed
the
case
because
of
want
of
an
actual
controversy.
in
an
election
situation,
which
we
feel
is
unique,
we
are
in
round-robin
of
going
to
the
court,
having
the
election
passed
and
then
coming
back
down
to
the
lower
court
and
raising
the
same
issues
in
the
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
they
refused
to
reach
the
merits
because
of
a
want
of
an
actual
controversy.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
no,
but
we
disagree
as
to
the
effect
of
that
type
of
relief.
we
feel
this
court
does
have
in
an
election
situation
of
a
1253
jurisdiction
to
review.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
let
me
make
one
or
two
more
points.
a
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
it
would
be
required
by
us
to
have
a
future
--
a
class
action
alleging
future
elections.
we
feel
that
this
would
be
an
unfair
requirement
to
ask
a
party
to
pick
candidates
in
the
future
to
run
for
elections
to
show
that
there
is
an
actual
controversy
or
that
they
intend
to
run
for
elections.
the
communist
party
itself,
the
political
party,
is
an
appellant
in
this
case
and
the
party
has
maintained
that
it
will
run
for
future
elections.
we
don't
feel
that
it
need
be
required
to
pick
particular
candidates
for
elections.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
that
is
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
castner
one
last
point,
we
feel
that
the
question
of
granting
of
declaratory
relief
after
the
need
for
an
injunction
is
passed
is
founded
in
the
number
of
decisions.
united
states
v.
149
gift
packages,
the
court
considered
a
case
of
libel
against
gift
packages
by
the
government
alleging
them
to
be
misbranded.
the
answer
did
not
deny
misbranding
but
filed
a
counterclaim
which
attacked
the
statute
as
unconstitutional.
in
that
case,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
declaratory
relief
was
granted
after
the
necessity
for
injunctive
relief
had
passed
and
the
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
was
sustained.
