justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
declare
that
act
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
are
to
declare
that
statute
unconstitutional
without
the
united
states
government
having
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
position,
who
is
now
speaking
for
the
united
states
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
we
declare
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
without
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
somebody
representing
him
being
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
was
that
there
was
no
case
in
controversy
because
the
attorney
general
in
his
amicus
brief
had
suggested
that
the
law
did
not
apply
to
minnesota.
is
that
what
judge
devitt
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
moot,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
wasn't
moot
why
did
you
amend?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
amended
because
it
had
been
moot
up
till
that
time.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
it's
done
everyday.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
now,
you
don't
know
what
the
next
secretary
of
state
would
do
about
this
act,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
the
next
secretary
of
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
what
he's
going
to
do
when
you
don't
even
know
who
he
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
speaking
about
lack
of
case
and
controversy,
i
mean
what
connecticut
does
in
somebody
else
that's
not
before
us.
do
you
have
anything
to
argue
for
other
than
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
you
originally
asked
to
get
on
the
ballot
of
1968
and
then
the
court
allowed
you
to
amend
and
then
you
came
in
and
said
you
proposed
to
it
to
those
candidates
the
future.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says
that
the
state
intends
to
prevent
you
from
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says
the
state
intends
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
appellants
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
is
no
longer
assistant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
this
--
whether
they
denied
that
the
act
applied
to
you
for
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
they
deny
that
the
act
applied
to
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
people
you
have
to
hear
if
you
want
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
actual
defense
did
they
put
up
for
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
actual
defense
have
they
put
up
for
a
law
of
this
kind
that
bars
a
party
from
running
in
the
state
if
it
acts
within
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
voters
did
you
say
they
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
--
what's
the
population
of
minnesota?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
afraid
this
450
would
overturn
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statement
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kyle,
would
it
be
possible
to
your
mind
as
solicitor
general
to
apprise
that
since
the
three-judge
court
has
already
ruled
on
the
1968
election
that
you
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
follow
that
in
later
elections
and
let
the
party
on
the
ballot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
haven't
passed
it
on
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
is
that
you
feel
obliged
to
follow
an
act
of
congress
which
has
no
means
of
enforcing
it
you
if
you
don't
follow
it
and
you
have
the
opinion
of
a
three-judge
constitutionally
set
up
court
that
you
did
not
have
to
follow
it.
isn't
that
enough
for
you
to
say
that
well
let's
forget
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can't
we
get
somebody
in
that
can
give
us
opinion
for
the
state
of
minnesota
if
you
are
not
authorized
to
do
it,
why
were
you
sent
here
for
if
not
to
make
a
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
were
asking
you
for
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
asking
you
on
the
ground
that
you
are
here
purporting
to
be
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
now,
are
you
and
do
you
have
a
full
authority
to
represent
him
in
this
argument
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
deny
having
that
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
deny
having
the
authority
which
the
chief
justice
asked
you
about?
if
so
how
can
you
claim
to
be
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota?
we
usually
have
representatives
for
parties
who
can
give
us
statements
about
the
position
of
the
party.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
deny
them
that
you
have
authority
to
determine
for
the
state
of
minnesota,
speak
for
him
now
and
say
whether
you
are
opposing
this
party
getting
on
the
ticket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
prayer
did
they
grant
then
on?
what
prayer
did
they
grant
the
injunction
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
where
is
the
request
for
an
injunction
that
they
granted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that,
would
you
read
that
line?
and
the
first
line
in
paragraph
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
does
that
word
permanent
injunction
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
permanent
injunction,
request
for
a
permanent
injunction
mean
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
does
it
say
with
reference
to
that
particular
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
section
5
as
to
where,
on
the
next
page,
what
is
usually
required
in
bills
for
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
about
that
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
i
have
used
it
many
times
in
complaints.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
always
thought
it
meant
that
you
are
asking
not
only
for
that
relief
but
for
any
other
relief
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
they
complained
of.
protect
the
rights,
what
did
you
mean
anything
but
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
rather
technical
construction,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be
and
court
sometimes
are
liberal
in
protecting
first
amendment
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
of
the
point
of
our
proceedings
according
from
all
14,
there
was
no
pleadings
subsequent
to
that,
wasn't
it?
this
amended
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
complaining
that
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
or
that
the
court
below
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
pardon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
we
do
not.
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
make
an
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
that
your
ground
that
there
should
have
been
one
judge
instead
of
a
three-judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
other
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
--
suppose
it
denies
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
said,
it
does
not
grant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
it
amounts
--
it
amounts
for
that
almost
doesn't
it
into
the
dismissing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
going
back
to
another
question
as
well
in
that
request.
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
my
viewpoint,
that
depends
on
paragraph
five
not
on
paragraph
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
this
amended
position
of
yours,
what
do
you
mean
--
what
do
you
mean
by
“there's
no
case
of
controversy”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
not
any
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
name
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case,
if
there
is
evidence
in
formal
letter
that
they
do
intend
to
keep
doing
for
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
contradicts
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that's
not
in
the
writing,
which
is
different
from
rhodes
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
says
for
granting
or
denying
an
injunction,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
permanent
injunction
that
you
asked
for
and
please
show
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
page
14
is
your
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
asked
for
in
paragraph
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
bound
on
what
you
ask
for
here?
number
one,
you
asked
for
a
specific
people,
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
1968
election.
now,
you
wanted
to
form
an
injunction
you
receive,
any
secretary
of
state
in
any
election,
any
time
in
the
future.
you
didn't
ask
for
anything
more
than
that
the
secretary
of
state
by
name
joseph
l.
donovan,
accept
this
petition
and
that
he'd
be
permanently
enjoined
from
not
accepting
it
for
1968,
isn't
that
what
you
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn't
deny
it.
now,
what
did
you
ask
for
in
injunctive
relief
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
how
are
you
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
if
you
filed
a
case
in
which
you
asked
for
a
two
declaratory
judgments
and
for
such
of
them
further
relief,
you
think
you'd
get
under
this
act?
this
is
a
special
act
and
requires
precise
proceedings
and
i
don't
think
you
can
say
under
further
relief.
where
are
you
going
to
get
your
permanent
injunction
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
that
is,
i
guess
was
that
under
the
all
writs
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
all
writs
statute,
i
guess.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
thanks
for
the
information.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
declare
that
act
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
are
to
declare
that
statute
unconstitutional
without
the
united
states
government
having
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
position,
who
is
now
speaking
for
the
united
states
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
we
declare
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
without
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
somebody
representing
him
being
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
was
that
there
was
no
case
in
controversy
because
the
attorney
general
in
his
amicus
brief
had
suggested
that
the
law
did
not
apply
to
minnesota.
is
that
what
judge
devitt
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
moot,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
wasn't
moot
why
did
you
amend?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
amended
because
it
had
been
moot
up
till
that
time.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
it's
done
everyday.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
now,
you
don't
know
what
the
next
secretary
of
state
would
do
about
this
act,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
the
next
secretary
of
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
what
he's
going
to
do
when
you
don't
even
know
who
he
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
speaking
about
lack
of
case
and
controversy,
i
mean
what
connecticut
does
in
somebody
else
that's
not
before
us.
do
you
have
anything
to
argue
for
other
than
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
you
originally
asked
to
get
on
the
ballot
of
1968
and
then
the
court
allowed
you
to
amend
and
then
you
came
in
and
said
you
proposed
to
it
to
those
candidates
the
future.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says
that
the
state
intends
to
prevent
you
from
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
says
the
state
intends
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
appellants
brief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
is
no
longer
assistant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
this
--
whether
they
denied
that
the
act
applied
to
you
for
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
they
deny
that
the
act
applied
to
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
people
you
have
to
hear
if
you
want
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
actual
defense
did
they
put
up
for
that
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
actual
defense
have
they
put
up
for
a
law
of
this
kind
that
bars
a
party
from
running
in
the
state
if
it
acts
within
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
voters
did
you
say
they
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
--
what's
the
population
of
minnesota?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
were
afraid
this
450
would
overturn
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statement
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kyle,
would
it
be
possible
to
your
mind
as
solicitor

to
apprise
that
since
the

that

and

the
party
on
the

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
haven't
passed
it
on
yet.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
is
that
you
feel
obliged
to
follow
an
act
of
congress
which
has
no
means
of
enforcing
it
you
if
you

and
you
have
the

of
a

that
you
did
not
have
to
follow
it.
isn't
that
enough
for
you
to
say
that
well
let's
forget
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can't
we
get
somebody
in
that
can
give
us
opinion
for
the
state
of
minnesota
if
you
are
not
authorized
to
do
it,
why
were
you
sent
here
for
if
not
to
make
a
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
were
asking
you
for
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
asking
you
on
the
ground
that
you
are
here
purporting
to
be
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
now,
are
you
and
do
you
have
a
full
authority
to
represent
him
in
this
argument
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
deny
having
that
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
deny
having
the
authority
which
the
chief
justice
asked
you
about?
if
so
how
can
you
claim
to
be
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota?
we
usually
have
representatives
for
parties
who
can
give
us
statements
about
the
position
of
the
party.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
deny
them
that
you
have
authority
to
determine
for
the
state
of
minnesota,
speak
for
him
now
and
say
whether
you
are
opposing
this
party
getting
on
the
ticket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
prayer
did
they
grant
then
on?
what
prayer
did
they
grant
the
injunction
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
where
is
the
request
for
an
injunction
that
they
granted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that,
would
you
read
that
line?
and
the
first
line
in
paragraph
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
does
that
word
permanent
injunction
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
permanent
injunction,
request
for
a
permanent
injunction
mean
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
does
it
say
with
reference
to
that
particular
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
section
5
as
to
where,
on
the
next
page,
what
is
usually
required
in
bills
for
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
about
that
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
i
have
used
it
many
times
in
complaints.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
always
thought
it
meant
that
you
are
asking
not
only
for
that
relief
but
for
any
other
relief
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
they
complained
of.
protect
the
rights,
what
did
you
mean
anything
but
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
rather
technical
construction,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be
and
court
sometimes
are
liberal
in
protecting
first
amendment
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
of
the
point
of
our
proceedings
according
from
all
14,
there
was
no
pleadings
subsequent
to
that,
wasn't
it?
this
amended
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
complaining
that
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
or
that
the
court
below
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
pardon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
we
do
not.
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
make
an
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
that
your
ground
that
there
should
have
been
one
judge
instead
of
a
three-judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
other
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
--
suppose
it
denies
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
said,
it
does
not
grant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
it
amounts
--
it
amounts
for
that
almost
doesn't
it
into
the
dismissing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
going
back
to
another
question
as
well
in
that
request.
justice
thurgood
marshall
from
my
viewpoint,
that
depends
on
paragraph
five
not
on
paragraph
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
this
amended
position
of
yours,
what
do
you
mean
--
what
do
you
mean
by
“there's
no
case
of
controversy”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
not
any
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
name
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case,
if
there
is
evidence
in
formal
letter
that
they
do
intend
to
keep
doing
for
the
communist
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
contradicts
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that's
not
in
the
writing,
which
is
different
from
rhodes
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
says
for
granting
or
denying
an
injunction,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
permanent
injunction
that
you
asked
for
and
please
show
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
page
14
is
your
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
asked
for
in
paragraph
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
bound
on
what
you
ask
for
here?
number
one,
you
asked
for
a
specific
people,
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
1968
election.
now,
you
wanted
to
form
an
injunction
you
receive,
any
secretary
of
state
in
any
election,
any
time
in
the
future.
you
didn't
ask
for
anything
more
than
that
the
secretary
of
state
by
name
joseph
l.
donovan,
accept
this
petition
and
that
he'd
be
permanently
enjoined
from
not
accepting
it
for
1968,
isn't
that
what
you
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn't
deny
it.
now,
what
did
you
ask
for
in
injunctive
relief
after
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
how
are
you
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
if
you
filed
a
case
in
which
you
asked
for
a
two
declaratory
judgments
and
for
such
of
them
further
relief,
you
think
you'd
get
under
this
act?
this
is
a
special
act
and
requires
precise
proceedings
and
i
don't
think
you
can
say
under
further
relief.
where
are
you
going
to
get
your
permanent
injunction
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh
that
is,
i
guess
was
that
under
the
all
writs
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
all
writs
statute,
i
guess.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
thanks
for
the
information.
