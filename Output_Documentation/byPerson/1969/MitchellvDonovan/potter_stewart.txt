justice
potter
stewart
when?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
only
injunction
you
asked
for?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what?
did
you
amend
your
--
did
you
amend
your
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
amend
your
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
the
prayer,
you
amended
the
complaint
to
allege
that
the
communist
party
of
the
state
intended
and
hoped
to
participate
in
future
elections
that
i
assume
was
not
in
the
prayer
justice
potter
stewart
how
if
at
all
was
the
prayer
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
injunction
you
ask
for,
as
i
understand
it
explicitly,
was
an
injunction
to
an
election
that
is
now
passed
and
an
election
in
which
your
clients
were
placed
on
a
ballot
in
that
time.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
thereafter
the
only
explicit
relief
demanded
either
in
the
original
complaint
or
in
the
complaint
that's
amended
was
one
for
declaratory
relief,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes,
you
were
entitled
to
ask
for
it
and
then
the
dismissal
would
have
been
a
denial
of
it
but
you
did
not
in
fact
ask
for
it,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
an
injunction
is
strong
medicine
and
generally
the
rules
of
pleading
required
that
if
you
want
an
injunction
you
have
to
ask
for
an
injunction
and
then
it
is
not
incorporated
in
the
ordinary
boilerplate
language
of
such
other
further
relief
that
maybe
appropriate
in
circumstances
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that
is
on
my
mind
i
suppose
to
these
questions
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
under
title
28
of
the
code
section
1253
whether
or
not
in
other
words
there
was
here
a
denial
of
an
injunction
and
there
was
a
denial
of
an
injunction
only
if
you
asked
for
an
injunction
that
was
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
going
to
spend
more
time
on
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
has
jurisdiction
under
section
1253?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
attorney
general
of
your
states
have
elected
officers?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
what,
a
four-year
term?
justice
potter
stewart
paragraph
two
on
page
14,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
granted
you
did
not
take
an
appeal
from
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
reach
that
--
we
reach
even
that
question.
we
don't
reach
if
we
don't
have
a
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
even
reach
this
first
question.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
volume?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what's
the
statute
say
28
united
states
code
section
1253.
it
doesn't
tell
you,
there's
no
question
about
that
concerning
whether
it
was
final
or
not
final,
whether
it
is
interlocutory
of
final
where
it's
concerned
of
whether
or
not
comes
under
the
terms
of
that
jurisdictional
statute.
it
appears
on
page
two
of
appellees'
brief.
i
think
you
know
what
it
says.
it
is
kind
of
a
rhetorical
question
of
mine,
that
i
have
it
before
me
and
nobody
answered.
i
did
not
end
it.
i'm
sorry
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
interlocutory
or
permanent.
justice
potter
stewart
what
injunction
was
denied
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
injunction
but
rather
the
injunction
you
asked
for
was
granted.
justice
potter
stewart
beside
the
feeling
up
here,
do
you
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
didn't
happen
to
you.
in
this
case,
you
got
exactly
the
relief
you
asked
for
with
respect
to
the
election
for
which
you
asked
it.
isn't
that
correct?
you
didn't
get
caught
in
a
round-robin
in
the
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
gave
you
exactly
the
relief
you
asked
for
with
respect
to
the
1968
election.
justice
potter
stewart
relief
you
wanted
to
get
the
names
of
your
people
on
the
ballot.
they
were
put
on
the
ballot.
unless,
i'm
mistaken
about
what
happened
in
this
case.
justice

no,
i'm
not,
i
was
