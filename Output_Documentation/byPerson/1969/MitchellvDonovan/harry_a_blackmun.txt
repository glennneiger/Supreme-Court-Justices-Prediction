justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
kyle,
assuming
that
the
three-judge
court
would
have
turn
this
on
ground
that
there
was
no
request
for
an
injunction.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it
has
turned
on
the
ground
it
is
no
case
controversy
and
you
know
are
urging
two
grounds
that
they
were
right
saying
there
is
no
case
of
controversy.
and
that
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
because
there
was
no
denial
of
injunction,
is
that
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
any
view
of
the
three-judge
court
whether
an
injunction
was
requested.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
we
think
that
it
was
sufficiently
requested
that
there
was
a
denial
here
then
i
take
it
what
we
have
to
decide
as
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
holding
that
there
was
no
case
of
controversy
within
golden
and
zwickler.
