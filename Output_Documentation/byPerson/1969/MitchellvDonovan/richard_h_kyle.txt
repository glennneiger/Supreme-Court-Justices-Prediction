mr.
richard
h.
kyle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
maybe
i
should
clarify
my
position
with
attorney
general's
office
at
the
outset
in
response
to
some
questions
which
arose.
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota
which
is
my
title
is
an
appointed
position
by
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
and
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
attorney
general
is
the
equivalent
of
an
assistant
or
deputy
attorney
general.
when
this
litigation
first
arose
and
through
the
district
court
proceedings,
i
was
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota
and
for
a
period
of
a
approximately
six
months
thereafter,
i
performed
a
different
function
within
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
with
a
different
title
and
then
returned
to
position
as
solicitor
general
which
i
now
--
which
position
i
now
hold.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
as
of
now.
the
statement
which
is
found
in
the
record
concerning
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
which
was
referred
to
by
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
statement
your
honor
which
was
found
in
the
record
concerning
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
a
future
election
and
made
by
me
--
was
made
by
and
the
statement
as
such
stands
now
to
the
extent
that
the
attorney
general
will
see
fit
to
follow
what
i
or
someone
else
on
the
staff
may
tell
him
to
do
with
respect
to
a
given
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
four-year
term.
his
term
expires
this
year.
he
is
not
a
candidate
for
reelection
as
is
the
secretary
of
state
who's
term
also
expires
this
year
and
he
is
not
a
candidate
for
reelection.
so,
absent
this
particular
question
arising
this
fall
and
it
could,
we
are
going
to
have
two
new
and
different
constitutional
officers
in
office
when
a
similar
petition
if
ever
is
presented.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
right,
in
january,
your
honor.
now,
the
position
of
the
state
or
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
state
who
were
named
defendants
in
this
action
at
the
very
outset
was
a
three-judge
district
court
was
not
required
to
hear
this
action
because
no
request
was
made
that
would
have
the
effect
of
restraining
the
operation
or
enforcement
of
act
of
congress
that
even
if
the
plaintiffs
here
secured
the
declaratory
relief
which
they
sought
that
the
party
be
placed
upon
the
ballot
and
that
their
candidates
be
allowed
to
run,
this
would
not
have
the
effect
of
putting
and
grinding
to
a
halt,
so
to
speak
the
operations
of
communist
control
act
1954
or
whatever
operation
that
act
had.
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
was
done
--
the
legal
authority
--
there
was
a
dispute
on
this
your
honor.
he
received
the
nominated
petition
as
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
as
to
what
he
should
do,
the
attorney
general
wrote
him
a
memorandum
or
opinion
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
pointed
out
the
provisions
of
the
communist
control
act
and
communist
control
act
only
and
said
that
this
act
appeared
to
apply
and
therefore
barred
the
party
from
participation
in
the
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
there
would
be
no
disabling
state
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
federal
law
requires
us
to
do
this,
this
was
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
position
we
took
and
it's
the
position
which
we
upheld
throughout.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
we
had
also
objected
to
the
convening
of
three-judge
court
because
we
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law
which
was
a
requirement
of
section
1983
the
civil
rights
act.
when
a
state
officer
acting
under
color
of
state
law
or
the
three-judge
district
court
disagreed
with
us
on
this
proposition
and
was
convened
and
then
made
its
decision
and
this
appeal
followed.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
they
filed
--
no,
your
honor
they
presented
to
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
--
a
nominating
petition
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
he
refused
to
accept
it.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
attorney
general
told
him
to
refuse
to
accept
it.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
on
the
ground
of
the
communist
control
act?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
we
said
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
we
didn't
tell
him
anything
about
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
at
the
time
that
we
were
presented
with
the
petition,
your
honor
the
situation
arose
in
this
manner.
the
petition
is
there.
we
look
at
the
communist
control
act
on
its
face,
at
least
in
my
opinion
and
i
still
have
this
opinion.
it
would
if
constitution
would
bar
the
communist
party
from
the
electoral
process
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
now,
the
only
decision
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
where
that
follows,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
the
state,
the
state
you're
right.
it
did
in
a
sense
that
the
state
said
no
you
are
not
going
on
the
ballot
and
then
it
was
an
issue
as
between
the
state
and
people
presenting
the
petition
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
the
ballot.
we
physically
said,
“no.”
and
our
only
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
they
have
not.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
they've
been
not.
they
ran
in
1968.
not
pursuant
to
anything
we
did
but
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
three-judge
district
court
but
there
has
been
no
request
since
that
time
to
come
on
again
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
or
there
has
been
opportunity
in
1969
which
we
had
at
least
local
elections
in
the
state
of
minnesota
as
far
as
our
office
was
concerned.
we
received
no
information
from
anyone
that
this
problem
had
arisen
again.
notwithstanding,
i
might
point
out,
the
affidavit
presented
by
the
secretary,
mrs.
smith
of
the
communist
party
that
they
intended
to
participate
in
future
minnesota
local
elections.
at
least
one
year
has
gone
by
and
if
participation
took
place
it
was
brought
to
no
ones
attention.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
i
would
have
no
difficulty
with
it
except
that
the
basis
of
the
three-judge
court's
ruling
your
honor
was
to
specifically
reserve
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
and
they
haven't
passed
it
on
yet.
they
simply
--
we
were
in
a
time
as
all
of
these
election
cases
are
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'd
like
to
say
yes
but
i
can't
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
is.
if
the
three-judge
court
had
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
act,
declared
the
act
to
be
unconstitutional
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
sir,
that
is
pleasure
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
think
i
am
authorized,
no
i'm
authorize
to
make
statements
on
behalf
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
you're
asking
me
to
enforce
an
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
he
has
not
asked
me
for
my
opinion
concerning
the
matter.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'm
not
sure,
i
understand
your
question?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
have
given
you
statements,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
i
am
opposing
this
party
getting
ticket.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
am
opposing
this
party
on
the
ticket
this
is
the
position
which
we
took
earlier
and
this
position
which
we
have
taken
this
litigation.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
do
it
on
the
ground
with
an
act
of
congress
has
said
as
i
read
that
act
of
congress
that
the
party
shall
not
go
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
court
put
them
on
ballot
because
the
court
said
we
do
not
have
enough
time
to
resolve
what
they
consider
to
be
the
difficult
grave
constitutional
issues
which
we
presented.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
whether
it
is
going
to
be
met
on
the
merits
or
not
your
honor
is
a
decision
which
this
court
is
going
to
make
right
now
which
i
have
no
control.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
but
i
--
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
now,
it
is
our
position
on
this
appeal
that
jurisdiction
is
also
lacking
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
a
three-judge
court
in
our
view
was
not
required
below
but
that
there
was
no
denial
of
permanent
injunction
in
this
litigation
and
that
is
a
requirement
of
section
1253,
a
section
which
recently
was
reviewed
in
analogous
context
in
a
goldstein
decision
by
this
court
about
two
months
ago.
it
says
that
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
from
a
final
order
granting
a
permanent
injunction
in
this
case.
now,
there
was
no
request
for
a
permanent
injunction
in
this
case.
it
was
requested
that
the
secretary
of
state
except
the
nominating
petition
and
that
he
place
those
candidates
upon
the
ballot.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that
request
for
relief
constituted
a
request
for
a
permanent
injunction,
it
was
granted.
the
temporary
mandatory
injunction
issued
by
the
three-judge
court
gave
to
the
plaintiffs,
every
aspect
of
the
injunctive
relief
which
they
had
originally
sought
and
it
was
only
at
that
stage
that
we
probably
could
have
appealed
to
this
court
from
the
granting
of
that
temporary
injunction
which
we
chose
not
to
do.
the
amendment
which
came
two
weeks
later
but
before
the
election
has
two
statement
of
facts
allegations
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
intends
to
participate,
whatever
that
means,
in
future
local,
national,
state
elections
and
further
that
the
attorney
general
will
continue
to
give
his
view
that
the
communist
control
act
bars.
no
request
that
any
state
official
present
or
future
be
barred
from
taking
any
action,
none
was
asked
for
and
therefore
none
was
given.
so,
it
is
only
i
submit,
if
this
court
reads
the
order
of
dismissal
as
moot,
as
having
the
effect
of
denying
their
request
for
permanent
injunction
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
and
i
submit
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me,
i
see.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
only
if
you
read
it
as
having
the
effect
of
denying
whatever
their
prayer
for
relief.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
communist
control
act
declared
unconsciously.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
there
was
no
request
for
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no
request
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
all
with
the
respect
to
the
1968
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
a
motion
for
a
temporary,
mandatory
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
motion,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
court
issues
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
permanent
injunction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
means
they
permanently
tell
the
second.
i
think
it
means
with
respect
of
the
in
context
in
which
it
is
brought
up
that
the
secretary
of
state
take
and
put
the
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
for
the
1968
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
means
that
he
does
it
for
all
time
with
respect
to
the
1968
election.
once
the
election
occurs
no
--
there
is
nothing
more
to
occur.
the
aforesaid
petition
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
because
it
says
to
accept
and
file
the
aforesaid
petition
and
that
aforesaid
petition
only
refers
to
the
1968
election
and
require
the
defendant
donovan
include
upon
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
to
be
held
on
november
5,
1968.
and
they
are
on
the
name
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
for
such
further
and
all
relief
that
the
court
may
deem
equitable
and
proper.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
think
it
is
a
standard
boilerplate
phrase,
which
is
put
in
every
--
well,
i
don't
think
it
has
any
meaning
in
of
it
self.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
but
if
it
does
means
that
your
honor,
it
means
that
to
protect
the
rights
within
the
context
of
the
this
case.
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
yours
is
a
rather
liberal
construction
of
the
same
phrase.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
in
any
event,
mr.
castner
made
a
statement
during
his
argument
to
the
effect
that
they
could
have
or
couldn't
or
unable
to
make
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
which
would
have
amended
the
prayer
for
relief.
there
is
no
reason
that
that
amendment
could
not
have
been
made
some
time
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
but
they
chose
not
to
and
the
motion
was
then
made
to
dismiss
and
it
was
granted
by
the
three-judge
court
and
it
is
from
that
order
that
we
are
now
before
this
court.
the
propriety
of
dismissing
this
lawsuit
is
perhaps
the
first
and
foremost
issue
before
the
court
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
all
of
the
factors
taken
together
that
the
three-judge
district
court
properly
determined
that
there
was
no
actual
controversy
between
these
parties
and
that
this
was
not
a
case
like
the
moore
v.
ogelvie
decision
of
this
court
within
the
last
year
which
was
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
a
review
because
i
think
even
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no
because
the
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
amended
complaint,
the
motion
to
amend
was
granted
on
the
same
day
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
was
granted.
these
were
--
they're
contained
in
the
same
order
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
complaining
that
you
do
not
at
this
stage
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
complaining
that
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
because
this
court
to
have
jurisdiction
it
must
be
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
--
from
an
order
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
there
was
an
order?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
communist
candidates
be
placed
upon
the
ballot
but
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
did
not
need
a
three-judge
district
court
below.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that's
right.
that's
one
of
the
grounds
and
the
other
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
other
ground
is
that
this
is
not
an
appeal
from
an
order
granting
a
permanent
injunction.
those
are
the
two
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me,
that's
denying
a
permanent
injunction?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
meant,
it
denied,
i
stand
corrected.
it
is
though
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
does
because
i
don't
see
how
it
can
amount
to
anything
if
there
is
no
request
for
it,
to
begin
with.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
but
it's
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
that
--
that
could
be
although
i
don't
think
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
no
because
they
simply
viewed
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
assuming
you
also
conclude
that
this
was
a
type
of
case
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
mean
that
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
is
required
and
under
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
there
must
be
a
live
controversy
between
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
are
standing
before
this
court.
i
think
it
is
hypothetical
at
best
as
to
whether
these
parties
are
ever
going
to
be
locked
together
on
this
issue
again
and
i
don't
think
that
the
pleadings
or
the
past
history
of
the
party,
the
communist
party,
for
that
matter,
support
the
likelihood
of
this
occurring.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
they
did
your
honor,
with
respect
to
class
action,
with
respect
to
those
who
signed
the
nominating
petition
and
those
who
did
not
sign
the
nominating
petition.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
there's
no
reference,
see
there
is
no
reference
any
place
to
future
candidates
or
future
elections.
and
with
respect
to
the
class
actions,
of
course,
this
court
in
hall
v.
beals
which
was
dismissal
of
a
suit
in
colorado
concerning
its
residency
requirements.
the
colorado
legislature,
as
i
recall,
amended
that
requirement
during
the
course
of
litigation,
so
that
the
plaintiffs
would
qualified
and
i
think
--
i
believe
this
court
said
that
in
so
doing
the
class
of
which
the
plaintiffs
were
members
when
the
suite
started
disappeared
because
they
were
no
longer
eligible
and
i
don't
think
we
really
have
a
class
even
of
the
plaintiffs
here
because
these
are
plaintiffs
who
signed
a
nominating
petition
for
the
1968
election
or
who
did
not
sign
the
nominating
petition
for
the
1968
election
and
that
election
having
gone
by,
their
status
as
class
members,
i
think
is
very
tenuous.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
brockington
v.
rhodes?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
if
it's
the
case
that
i
am
thinking
it
is
one
in
which
he
did
not
bring
it
as
class
action,
it's
brockington
v.
rhodes.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
in
which
the
court
does
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
brockington.
b-r-o-c-k--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
your
honor
but
it
is
90
supreme
court
206.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
90
supreme
court
at
page
206.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
there
is
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
the
secretary
of
the
minnesota
communist
party
that
they
intend
to
participate
in
future
minnesota
local
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes
sir.
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
we
have
taken
the
position
your
honor
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court
and
is
failing
to
present
an
actual
controversy.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
maybe
i
should
clarify
my
position
with
attorney
general's
office
at
the
outset
in
response
to
some
questions
which
arose.
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota
which
is
my
title
is
an
appointed
position
by
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
and
serves
at
the
pleasure
of
the
attorney
general
is
the
equivalent
of
an
assistant
or
deputy
attorney
general.
when
this
litigation
first
arose
and
through
the
district
court
proceedings,
i
was
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
minnesota
and
for
a
period
of
a
approximately
six
months
thereafter,
i
performed
a
different
function
within
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
with
a
different
title
and
then
returned
to
position
as
solicitor
general
which
i
now
--
which
position
i
now
hold.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
as
of
now.
the
statement
which
is
found
in
the
record
concerning
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
which
was
referred
to
by
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
statement
your
honor
which
was
found
in
the
record
concerning
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
a
future
election
and
made
by
me
--
was
made
by
and
the
statement
as
such
stands
now
to
the
extent
that
the
attorney
general
will
see
fit
to
follow
what
i
or
someone
else
on
the
staff
may
tell
him
to
do
with
respect
to
a
given
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
four-year
term.
his
term
expires
this
year.
he
is
not
a
candidate
for
reelection
as
is
the
secretary
of
state
who's
term
also
expires
this
year
and
he
is
not
a
candidate
for
reelection.
so,
absent
this
particular
question
arising
this
fall
and
it
could,
we
are
going
to
have
two
new
and
different
constitutional
officers
in
office
when
a
similar
petition
if
ever
is
presented.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
right,
in
january,
your
honor.
now,
the
position
of
the
state
or
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
state
who
were
named
defendants
in
this
action
at
the
very
outset
was
a
three-judge
district
court
was
not
required
to
hear
this
action
because
no
request
was
made
that
would
have
the
effect
of
restraining
the
operation
or
enforcement
of
act
of
congress
that
even
if
the
plaintiffs
here
secured
the
declaratory
relief
which
they
sought
that
the
party
be
placed
upon
the
ballot
and
that
their
candidates
be
allowed
to
run,
this
would
not
have
the
effect
of
putting
and
grinding
to
a
halt,
so
to
speak
the
operations
of
communist
control
act
1954
or
whatever
operation
that
act
had.
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
was
done
--
the
legal
authority
--
there
was
a
dispute
on
this
your
honor.
he
received
the
nominated
petition
as
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
as
to
what
he
should
do,
the
attorney
general
wrote
him
a
memorandum
or
opinion
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
pointed
out
the
provisions
of
the
communist
control
act
and
communist
control
act
only
and
said
that
this
act
appeared
to
apply
and
therefore
barred
the
party
from
participation
in
the
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
there
would
be
no
disabling
state
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
federal
law
requires
us
to
do
this,
this
was
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
position
we
took
and
it's
the
position
which
we
upheld
throughout.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
we
had
also
objected
to
the
convening
of
three-judge
court
because
we
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
acting
under
the
color
of
state
law
which
was
a
requirement
of
section
1983
the
civil
rights
act.
when
a
state
officer
acting
under
color
of
state
law
or
the
three-judge
district
court
disagreed
with
us
on
this
proposition
and
was
convened
and
then
made
its
decision
and
this
appeal
followed.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
they
filed
--
no,
your
honor
they
presented
to
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
--
a
nominating
petition
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
he
refused
to
accept
it.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
attorney
general
told
him
to
refuse
to
accept
it.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
on
the
ground
of
the
communist
control
act?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
we
said
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
we
didn't
tell
him
anything
about
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
at
the
time
that
we
were
presented
with
the
petition,
your
honor
the
situation
arose
in
this
manner.
the
petition
is
there.
we
look
at
the
communist
control
act
on
its
face,
at
least
in
my
opinion
and
i
still
have
this
opinion.
it
would
if
constitution
would
bar
the
communist
party
from
the
electoral
process
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
now,
the
only
decision
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
where
that
follows,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
the
state,
the
state
you're
right.
it
did
in
a
sense
that
the
state
said
no
you
are
not
going
on
the
ballot
and
then
it
was
an
issue
as
between
the
state
and
people
presenting
the
petition
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
the
ballot.
we
physically
said,
“no.”
and
our
only
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
they
have
not.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
they've
been
not.
they
ran
in
1968.
not
pursuant
to
anything
we
did
but
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
three-judge
district
court
but
there
has
been
no
request
since
that
time
to
come
on
again
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
or
there
has
been
opportunity
in
1969
which
we
had
at
least
local
elections
in
the
state
of
minnesota
as
far
as
our
office
was
concerned.
we
received
no
information
from
anyone
that
this
problem
had
arisen
again.
notwithstanding,
i
might
point
out,
the
affidavit
presented
by
the
secretary,
mrs.
smith
of
the
communist
party
that
they
intended
to
participate
in
future
minnesota
local
elections.
at
least
one
year
has
gone
by
and
if
participation
took
place
it
was
brought
to
no
ones
attention.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
i
would
have
no
difficulty
with
it
except
that
the
basis
of
the
three-judge
court's
ruling
your
honor
was
to
specifically
reserve
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
and
they
haven't
passed
it
on
yet.
they
simply
--
we
were
in
a
time
as
all
of
these
election
cases
are
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'd
like
to
say
yes
but
i
can't
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
is.
if
the
three-judge
court
had
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
act,
declared
the
act
to
be
unconstitutional
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
sir,
that
is
pleasure
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
think
i
am
authorized,
no
i'm
authorize
to
make
statements
on
behalf
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
you're
asking
me
to
enforce
an
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
he
has
not
asked
me
for
my
opinion
concerning
the
matter.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'm
not
sure,
i
understand
your
question?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
have
given
you
statements,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
i
am
opposing
this
party
getting
ticket.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
am
opposing
this
party
on
the
ticket
this
is
the
position
which
we
took
earlier
and
this
position
which
we
have
taken
this
litigation.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
do
it
on
the
ground
with
an
act
of
congress
has
said
as
i
read
that
act
of
congress
that
the
party
shall
not
go
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
court
put
them
on
ballot
because
the
court
said
we
do
not
have
enough
time
to
resolve
what
they
consider
to
be
the
difficult
grave
constitutional
issues
which
we
presented.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
whether
it
is
going
to
be
met
on
the
merits
or
not
your
honor
is
a
decision
which
this
court
is
going
to
make
right
now
which
i
have
no
control.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
but
i
--
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
now,
it
is
our
position
on
this
appeal
that
jurisdiction
is
also
lacking
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
a
three-judge
court
in
our
view
was
not
required
below
but
that
there
was
no
denial
of
permanent
injunction
in
this
litigation
and
that
is
a
requirement
of
section
1253,
a
section
which
recently
was
reviewed
in
analogous
context
in
a
goldstein
decision
by
this
court
about
two
months
ago.
it
says
that
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
from
a
final
order
granting
a
permanent
injunction
in
this
case.
now,
there
was
no
request
for
a
permanent
injunction
in
this
case.
it
was
requested
that
the
secretary
of
state
except
the
nominating
petition
and
that
he
place
those
candidates
upon
the
ballot.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that
request
for
relief
constituted
a
request
for
a
permanent
injunction,
it
was
granted.
the
temporary
mandatory
injunction
issued
by
the
three-judge
court
gave
to
the
plaintiffs,
every
aspect
of
the
injunctive
relief
which
they
had
originally
sought
and
it
was
only
at
that
stage
that
we
probably
could
have
appealed
to
this
court
from
the
granting
of
that
temporary
injunction
which
we
chose
not
to
do.
the
amendment
which
came
two
weeks
later
but
before
the
election
has
two
statement
of
facts
allegations
that
the
communist
party
of
minnesota
intends
to
participate,
whatever
that
means,
in
future
local,
national,
state
elections
and
further
that
the
attorney
general
will
continue
to
give
his
view
that
the
communist
control
act
bars.
no
request
that
any
state
official
present
or
future
be
barred
from
taking
any
action,
none
was
asked
for
and
therefore
none
was
given.
so,
it
is
only
i
submit,
if
this
court
reads
the
order
of
dismissal
as
moot,
as
having
the
effect
of
denying
their
request
for
permanent
injunction
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
and
i
submit
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me,
i
see.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
only
if
you
read
it
as
having
the
effect
of
denying
whatever
their
prayer
for
relief.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
communist
control
act
declared
unconsciously.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
there
was
no
request
for
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no
request
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
all
with
the
respect
to
the
1968
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
a
motion
for
a
temporary,
mandatory
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
motion,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
court
issues
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
permanent
injunction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
means
they
permanently
tell
the
second.
i
think
it
means
with
respect
of
the
in
context
in
which
it
is
brought
up
that
the
secretary
of
state
take
and
put
the
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
for
the
1968
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
it
means
that
he
does
it
for
all
time
with
respect
to
the
1968
election.
once
the
election
occurs
no
--
there
is
nothing
more
to
occur.
the
aforesaid
petition
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
because
it
says
to
accept
and
file
the
aforesaid
petition
and
that
aforesaid
petition
only
refers
to
the
1968
election
and
require
the
defendant
donovan
include
upon
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
to
be
held
on
november
5,
1968.
and
they
are
on
the
name
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
for
such
further
and
all
relief
that
the
court
may
deem
equitable
and
proper.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
think
it
is
a
standard
boilerplate
phrase,
which
is
put
in
every
--
well,
i
don't
think
it
has
any
meaning
in
of
it
self.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
but
if
it
does
means
that
your
honor,
it
means
that
to
protect
the
rights
within
the
context
of
the
this
case.
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
yours
is
a
rather
liberal
construction
of
the
same
phrase.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
in
any
event,
mr.
castner
made
a
statement
during
his
argument
to
the
effect
that
they
could
have
or
couldn't
or
unable
to
make
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
which
would
have
amended
the
prayer
for
relief.
there
is
no
reason
that
that
amendment
could
not
have
been
made
some
time
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
but
they
chose
not
to
and
the
motion
was
then
made
to
dismiss
and
it
was
granted
by
the
three-judge
court
and
it
is
from
that
order
that
we
are
now
before
this
court.
the
propriety
of
dismissing
this
lawsuit
is
perhaps
the
first
and
foremost
issue
before
the
court
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
all
of
the
factors
taken
together
that
the
three-judge
district
court
properly
determined
that
there
was
no
actual
controversy
between
these
parties
and
that
this
was
not
a
case
like
the
moore
v.
ogelvie
decision
of
this
court
within
the
last
year
which
was
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
a
review
because
i
think
even
that
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no
because
the
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
amended
complaint,
the
motion
to
amend
was
granted
on
the
same
day
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
was
granted.
these
were
--
they're
contained
in
the
same
order
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
complaining
that
you
do
not
at
this
stage
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
complaining
that
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
because
this
court
to
have
jurisdiction
it
must
be
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
--
from
an
order
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
there
was
an
order?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
the
communist
candidates
be
placed
upon
the
ballot
but
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
did
not
need
a
three-judge
district
court
below.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that's
right.
that's
one
of
the
grounds
and
the
other
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
the
other
ground
is
that
this
is
not
an
appeal
from
an
order
granting
a
permanent
injunction.
those
are
the
two
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
excuse
me,
that's
denying
a
permanent
injunction?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
meant,
it
denied,
i
stand
corrected.
it
is
though
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
does
because
i
don't
see
how
it
can
amount
to
anything
if
there
is
no
request
for
it,
to
begin
with.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
but
it's
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
well,
that
--
that
could
be
although
i
don't
think
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
no
because
they
simply
viewed
the
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
assuming
you
also
conclude
that
this
was
a
type
of
case
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
mean
that
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
it
is
required
and
under
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
there
must
be
a
live
controversy
between
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
are
standing
before
this
court.
i
think
it
is
hypothetical
at
best
as
to
whether
these
parties
are
ever
going
to
be
locked
together
on
this
issue
again
and
i
don't
think
that
the
pleadings
or
the
past
history
of
the
party,
the
communist
party,
for
that
matter,
support
the
likelihood
of
this
occurring.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
they
did
your
honor,
with
respect
to
class
action,
with
respect
to
those
who
signed
the
nominating
petition
and
those
who
did
not
sign
the
nominating
petition.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no,
there's
no
reference,
see
there
is
no
reference
any
place
to
future
candidates
or
future
elections.
and
with
respect
to
the
class
actions,
of
course,
this
court
in
hall
v.
beals
which
was
dismissal
of
a
suit
in
colorado
concerning
its
residency
requirements.
the
colorado
legislature,
as
i
recall,
amended
that
requirement
during
the
course
of
litigation,
so
that
the
plaintiffs
would
qualified
and
i
think
--
i
believe
this
court
said
that
in
so
doing
the
class
of
which
the
plaintiffs
were
members
when
the
suite
started
disappeared
because
they
were
no
longer
eligible
and
i
don't
think
we
really
have
a
class
even
of
the
plaintiffs
here
because
these
are
plaintiffs
who
signed
a
nominating
petition
for
the
1968
election
or
who
did
not
sign
the
nominating
petition
for
the
1968
election
and
that
election
having
gone
by,
their
status
as
class
members,
i
think
is
very
tenuous.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
brockington
v.
rhodes?
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes,
if
it's
the
case
that
i
am
thinking
it
is
one
in
which
he
did
not
bring
it
as
class
action,
it's
brockington
v.
rhodes.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
in
which
the
court
does
--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
brockington.
b-r-o-c-k--
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
your
honor
but
it
is
90
supreme
court
206.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
90
supreme
court
at
page
206.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
there
is
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
the
secretary
of
the
minnesota
communist
party
that
they
intend
to
participate
in
future
minnesota
local
election.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
no.
mr.
richard
h.
kyle
yes
sir.
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
we
have
taken
the
position
your
honor
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court
and
is
failing
to
present
an
actual
controversy.
