through
these
two
access,
one
on
page
of
119
and
the
other
on
page
194
indicate
there
are
two
quite
disparate
foundations
for
this
maximum.
one
being
the
matter
of
the
sufficiency
of
funds
available,
that's
on
119;
and
the
other
quite
a
different
one
and
that
is
a
matter
of
policy.
so,
it's
not
to
have
people
on
welfare
have
a
hiring
from
the
people
who
were
against
the
employer
of
work.
is
that,
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice

stewart
so,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
these
are
not
independent
and
separate
the
reasons
but
rather
relative
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
given
insufficient
funds,
what
shall
we
do
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
that
suggest
aspect
to
the
reason
this
do
fit
family
where
there's
no
breadwinner?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
may
i
ask
that
computation
is
rather
complicated
as
it
is
not
depending
upon
the
sex
and
the
age
of
the
child
and
upon
whether
or
not
he
is
a
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
or
sixth
child?
am
i
or
is
it
simpler
or
it
is
just
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
point
in
the
appendix
to
where
those
computations
--
justice
potter
stewart
published?
because
i
think
in
understanding
of
that
may
have
perhaps
no
little
relevance
to
the
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
quite
wrong
but
if
we
are
talking
about
equal
protection
here,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
what
the
basic
computations
are
up
until
you
reach
the
maximum.
well,
i
don't
want
to
undo
of
the
record
then
your
argument
if
you
could
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
just
so
i
can
call
your
argument.
it
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
just
$28.50
per
month
per
child
is
something
like
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
would
say
that
the
state
could
give
$30.00
per
month
for
the
first
child
that
$25.00
in
month
for
the
second
child?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
$65
a
month
come
under
the
same
afdc?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would,
not
a
separate
program.
justice
potter
stewart
to
whom
does
the
welfare
check
go?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
a
single
woman
either
because
her
spouses
is
about
inherit
or
by
there
something
goes
to
her,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it's
a
matter
of
woman
and
both
in
capacity,
it
goes
right
to
the
man?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
people
and
presumably
who
is
not
to
fifth
or
sixth
or
seventh
or
eighth
child
and
necessarily
suffers
it's
the
whole
family.
since
income
is
reduced
on
a
per
capita
basis
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
a
smaller
family
at
such
the
net
effect,
isn't
that?
justice
