mr.
george
w.
liebmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
please.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
maryland
regulation.
regulation
of
the
state
board
of
social
services
which
has
been
in
a
fact
in
varying
forms
since
1947.
which
limits
the
total
benefits
payable
to
single
family
under
the
program
to
a
families
with
dependent
children
$250.00
per
month
subject
to
certain
exceptions
none
of
which
are
here
pertinent.
this
regulation
has
either
been
in
a
fact
or
been
under
consideration.
since
the
inception
of
state
wide
need
standards
under
the
afdc
program
in
maryland
in
1944.
their
appears
at
page
116
of
the
record
extract,
a
document
generated
of
the
time.
it
was
first
considered
imposing
state
wide
“need
standards”
and
the
last
paragraph
of
that
document
indicates
that
the
state
board
will
be
considering
the
question
of
whether
the
regulation
should
permit
the
setting
of
a
maximum
amount
above
which
no
grant
will
go,
that
appears
at
page
119
of
the
record
aspect.
subsequently
in
1947,
the
first
of
this
long
serious
maximum
grant
regulations
was
promulgate.
there
are
extensive
materials
in
the
record
here
which
relate
to
the
considerations
of
which
entered
into
the
promulgation
of
this
regulation.
the
materials
in
question
minutes
of
state
board
meetings
and
such
appear
at
pages
127
through
147
of
the
record
abstract.
i
will
not
undertake
a
detailed
summary
of
these
materials
here.
their
also
appears
at
page
165
of
the
record
abstract.
the
report
of
an
unofficial
committee
of
the
body
known
as
the
maryland
commission
on
governmentally
efficiency
in
economy
in
1948
which
shares
the
good
deal
of
light
on
the
thinking
which
entered
into
the
promulgation
of
these
maximum
grant
regulations
beginning
in
1947.
basically
the
thought
behind
the
regulation,
i
think
it's
summed
up
in
an
affidavit
of
one
of
the
veteran
officials
of
the
state
department
of
social
services,
an
affidavit
which
appears
at
page
194
of
the
record
abstract.
and
that
affidavit
states,
it
is
my
recollection
that
a
maximum
grant
regulation
has
been
in
a
fact
in
maryland
since
approximately
the
time
of
inception
of
state
wide
“need
standards”
in
1944.
it
is
also
my
recollection
that
these
maximum
grant
regulations
consist
simply
have
received
federal
approval.
i
also
recall,
that
one
factor
giving
rise
to
these
regulations
was
the
strong
feeling
on
the
part
of
many
county
boards.
particularly
during
the
period
following
adoption
of
state
wide
“need
standards”
in
1944
that
public
assistants'
payment
shall
not
--
should
not
exceed
the
earnings
of
the
head
of
a
family
when
all
for
assistance
and
that
the
income
of
a
public
assistant
recipient
should
not
exceed
that
of
his
employed
neighbors.
i
recall
that
at
various
times
during
the
early
years
following
the
introduction
of
the
maximum
grant
regulation.
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
secured
information
as
to
way
two
levels
from
the
state
employment
service
that
the
information
now
secured
with
utilized
in
establishing
maximum
grant
levels.
now,
the
maryland
regulation
is
innate,
it
finds
--
there
are
similar
regulations
in
some
20
out
of
a
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
your
honor,
that's
correct
in
one
sense.
i
think
your
honor
that
there
was
--
there
is
problem
in
--
there
was
a
problem
of
insufficient
funds.
i'd
rather
put
it
this
way.
there
was
a
problem
of
insufficient
funds
and
the
board
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
making
a
choice
between
different
means
of
carrying
out
of
reduction.
and
for
the
policy
reason
that
it
thought
that
grant
shouldn't
exceed
the
income
of
employed
families.
it
choose
the
device
of
the
maximum
grant
rather
than
the
device
of
a
presented
reduction
across
the
board
for
all
afdc
recipients
which
is
a
devised,
it's
been
employed
in
some
other
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
they're
always
insufficient
funds
in
almost
any
welfare
program.
the
question
is
where
your
--
how
you're
going
to
design
the
benefits
structure
to
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
we
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
we
suggest
that
in
addition
to
the
--
we
suggest
that
there
are
several
considerations
which
can
support
the
regulation.
one
of
them
is
the
element
of
work
incentive.
another,
is
the
undesirability
of
establishing
benefit
levels
at
levels
higher
than
prevailing
wage
rates
in
the
community
because
of
the
effect
of
this
may
have
on
families
that
are
not
on
welfare.
because
of
the
possible
incentive
to
family
breakup
which
can
be
created.
and
that
i
think
is
a
major
consideration
behind
the
present
discussion
of
welfare
reform
which
would
provide
subventions
to
employed
persons
as
well
as
unemployed
persons
that's
concern.
not
only
with
the
effect
of
the
regulations
on
people
on
welfare
but
appealing
with
this
can't
be
divorce
with
consideration,
problem
consideration,
of
the
effect
of
the
regulations
on
people
who
are
not
on
welfare.
there
is
another
answer,
i
think
to
your
question
and
that
is
that
in
speaking
of
families
that
don't
have
a
breadwinner.
you
are
speaking
of
--
there
are
some
families
from
which
the
male
head
is
absent.
there
are
other
families
which
male
head
is
present
but
a
disabled.
there're
other
families
and
which
male
head
is
present
but
unemployed.
with
respect
to
the
disable
and
unemployed
categories,
i
think
the
court
is
aware
of
the
provisions
of
the
state
unemployment
compensation
and
workman's
compensation
laws.
which
almost
invariantly
fixed
benefits
for
the
unemployed
and
for
persons
on
workman's
compensation
at
levels
that
are
fraction
of
actual
earnings.
in
maryland,
i
believe
the
fraction
is
too
big
and
this
is
done
even
though
there
are
elaborate
procedures
for
insuring
that
people
are
not
malingering
on
the
workman's
compensation
rules
or
malingering
on
the
unemployment
roles.
and
the
reason
is
i
think,
essentially
a
concession
to
administrative
imperfection.
a
feeling
that
if
you
don't
set
the
benefit
levels
at
least
somewhat
below
the
wage
level,
there
is
going
to
be
abuse.
and
i
think
that
that
feeling
also
enters
into
the
maximum
grant
regulation
even
in
its
application
to
families
which
when
you
look
at
the
main
now
appear
to
have
a
wage
enter
and
that
the
breadwinner
maybe
disabled
or
maybe
unemployed.
i
think
if
its
rational
really
under
the
workman's
compensation
and
unemployment
insurance
rules
regulations
for
that
reason
it's
rational
here.
i
should
point
out
also
that
the
maryland
regulation
has
two
elements
which
are
not
present
in
the
welfare
regulation
or
some
of
the
other
states.
one
of
them
is
that
it's
one
of
the
highest
such
regulations.
you
are
dealing
here
with
the
regulation
that
really
is
at
least
somewhat
related
to
the
minimum
wage
rate
or
the
average
wage
rate
efforts.
when
the
none
taxability
of
the
benefits,
when
the
various
forms
of
the
aid
and
kind
are
available
--
that
are
available
are
considered.
you're
talking
about
the
level
of
income
that
is
in
fact
considerable
higher
than
your
minimum
wage
or
even
your
average
wage
in
some
forms
of
employment.
that
the
second
element
and
i
think
its
worth
expressing
is
that
the
maryland
regulation
unlike
those
in
some
states
such
as
maine
and
arizona
is
a
limitation
only
on
the
amount
of
the
grant
and
not
on
the
amount
of
a
welfare
family's
budget.
that
is
to
say,
if
a
family
has
state
computed
needs
of
$350.00
and
the
maximum
of
$250.00
in
grant
is
applied
to
if
the
first
$100.00
in
earnings
by
a
member
of
that
family
maybe
retained
without
reducing
the
welfare
grant.
for
this
reason,
the
maryland
regulation
has
some
other
important
work
incentive
the
facts
which
are
not
present
in
the
regulations
of
those
states
such
as
maine
and
arizona
that
have
a
maximum
budget
limitation.
now,
the
complaint
in
this
action
made
three
claims.
the
first
was
a
claim
of
violation
of
state
law.
that
claim
is
contained
in
paragraph
vii-c
of
the
complaint.
the
second
was
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
preamble
of
the
social
security
act
of
1935,
which
was
sent
to
afford
the
basis
for
finding
that
this
regulation
was
inconsistent
with
the
social
security
act.
there
was
no
mention
made
in
the
complaint
of
any
more
specific
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
the
lower
court
in
its
initial
opinion
found
a
violation
of
section
602(a)(9)
of
the
social
security
act
and
it
conceded
on
re-argument
that
and
i
think
i
am
quoting
from
a
transcripts
on
re-argument.
the
statutory
argument
is
the
basis
of
decision
that
was
relatively
speaking
devised
by
the
court
rather
than
the
one
that
was
impressed
on
the
court
you
and
your
colleagues
addressing
plaintiffs
counsel.
that
i
think
is
true
and
on
re-argument,
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
violated
that
provision
the
social
security
act
was
withdrawn.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
was
withdrawn.
the
third
contention
was
the
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
each
of
these
three
claims
in
turn.
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
violation
of
state
law.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
ground
of
equitable
extension.
the
court
below
declines
to
abstain
and
its
oral
opinion
on
this
point
is
found
at
page
83
of
the
record
abstract.
and
it
cited
the
case
of
king
versus
smith
for
the
proposition
that
it
was
proper
for
a
federal
court
to
go
forward
with
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
irrespective
of
whether
a
state
court
by
state
construction
of
state
law
at
some
later
date
might
achieve
the
same
result.
that
language
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
king
versus
smith
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
king
v.
smith
was
concerned
with
the
fact
that
there
is
no
federal
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies.
king
versus
smith
was
concerned
with
the
exhaustion
problem.
the
question
of
equitable
abstention
in
favor
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
not
an
issue
in
king
versus
smith.
now,
it's
the
state's
position
here
that
the
claim,
that
the
regulation
was
violated
of
state
law
should've
been
regarded
as
providing
a
basis
for
equitable
abstention
in
the
favor
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
state
courts.
and
that
is
i
think
clear
from
the
cases
under
the
maryland
declaratory
judgment
act,
that
where
the
general
validity
of
state's
statute
or
regulation
is
a
sale
as
it
is
here,
that
an
action
in
a
state
courts
for
declaratory
judgment
would
lie.
state
courts
of
course
could've
determine
all
three
questions
raised
by
the
complaint.
the
federal
court
was
effectively
limited
to
the
two
federal
questions
and
the
reasons
that
you
have
this
collision
between
the
federal
court
and
the
state
regulation
was
the
failure
to
abstain
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
federal
statutory
claim
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
on
abstention
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
i
think
if
not
in
the
welfare
context
your
honor,
i
think
if
when
applies
the
tests
announced
by
this
court
in
harrison
v.
aacp
and
sheckler
v.
scooter
to
the
situation
in
this
case,
abstention
would
be
appropriate.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
construction
by
the
state
courts
of
a
none
construed
state
law
would
have
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
--
that
might
have
avoid
that
the
necessity
of
having
the
federal
court
reach
these
questions.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
open
to
them
to
raise
the
federal
questions
from
the
state
court
is
also,
of
course.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
could
your
honor.
its
no
reason
why
they
could
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there's
a
requirement
but
they
litigate
the
federal
issues
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
federal
court
should've
abstain.
with
respect
to
the
federal
statutory
claim.
there
are
i
think
three
points,
three
rule
of
fundamental
points
which
i
wish
to
make.
the
first
point
is
the
obvious
one
and
the
one
which
the
lower
court
took
no
doubt
in
its
opinion
on
re-argument.
and
that
is
that
this
statute
has
on
at
least
--
that
the
existence
of
state
maximum
grant
regulations
has
own
at
least
three
occasions
been
expressly
recognized
by
congress
in
legislation.
and
that
more
of
the
maryland
regulation
specifically
has
been
on
at
least
20
occasions
accepted
for
incorporation
in
the
state
plan
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare.
this
is
unremitting
course
of
construction
and
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
the
fate
for
example
of
the
regulation,
the
substitute
for
the
regulations
involved
in
the
case
of
king
versus
smith
when
they
were
submitted
to
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare.
and
you
had
disapproval
is
not
only
of
the
alabama
regulation
there
at
issue,
but
some
of
the
regulations.
now
the
states,
it's
quite
clear
that
contrary
to
the
claim
of
the
appellee
is
here.
the
process
of
approval
of
state
plan
amendments
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
it's
not
a
ministerial
process.
it
is
a
finding
and
it's
required
to
be
a
finding
that
the
regulation
is
in
conformity
with
the
federal
law.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
the
issue,
the
issue
your
honor
is
--
there
are
several
issues
and
i
think
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
lower
court
acted
properly.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
crucial
issue
is
whether
the
lower
court
acted
properly
in
validating
this
state
maximum
grant
regulation
on
its
phase
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
when
this
regulation
was
concededly
valid
as
to
at
least
some
of
the
people
to
whom
it
would
be
applied
and
when
it
was
supported
by
several
rational
basics.
i
think
if
i
had
to
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
believe
your
honor
that
reversal
--
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
injunction
dissolves.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
challenge
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
what
is
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
application
of
the
maximum.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
its
claim
that
you
cannot
have
a
family
maximum.
yes,
it's
the
claim
that
you
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
but
you
cannot
have
a
family
maximum
which
gives
a
large
family
less
than
what
its
members
is
might
be
entitle
to
if
payments
were
made
to
them
on
what
might
be
describe
as
a
per
capita
basis.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
it's
$250.00
per
month
of
the
stage.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
the
consequence
invalidation
of
this
regulation
was
that
in
order
to
pay
the
families
affected
by
of
their
full
computed
need,
the
additional
money
required
had
to
come
entirely
out
of
state
funds.
the
federal
government
matches
state
contributions
up
to
$32.00
per
recipient
and
in
maryland,
the
per
capita
expenditure
or
something
like
$37.00
per
recipient.
so
that
the
entire
additional
cost
here
had
to
come
out
of
state
funds.
i
should've
there
that
the
federal
matching
takes
place
whether
or
not
the
state
has
a
maximum
preventing
the
payment
of
additional
benefits
as
to
certain
members
of
the
family.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes
sir.
your
honor,
now
that
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
your
honor.
you
have
not.
but
i
should
observe
the
state
has
taken
the
appeal
from
a
finding
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
would
do
its
decision,
it
just
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that
is
what
the
lower
court
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
and
i
think
it's
a
reversal
of
what
usually
happens
in
these
case
where
there's
never
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor
and
so,
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that
your
honor
is
a
--
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
put
it
in
that
way.
i
think
our
position
is
that
courts
by
their
very
nature
can
have
the
expertise
--
can
have
the
expertise
to
apply
the
standard
of
review
that
the
appellees
here
would
have
them
applied
to
state
social
and
economic
regulations
as
be
complicated
to
effect
of
this
one.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
for
this
reason.
this
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
well,
the
lower
courts
your
honor
declined
in
terms
to
commend
that
state
to
pay
them
and
issue
to
negative
injunction
which
presented
for
the
state
with
a
abstinent
choice
of
either
finding
and
additional
million
dollars
to
pay
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
to
the
state
either
have
to
find
their
additional
million
dollars
or
would
have
been
confronted
with
alternative
of
a
4%
slash
in
all
the
welfare
payments
to
the
aged,
the
blind,
the
disabled,
and
other
families
under
the
afdc
program.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
there
was
no
question
of
forfeiture
of
the
federal
contribution
here.
this
was
because
the
federal
government
will
match
only
up
to
a
certain
level
per
recipient
and
it
already
matched
up
to
that
level.
so,
any
additional
money
is
have
to
come
from
state
funds
and
this
matter
i
think
that
appears
quietly
like
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
question
would
be
this.
in
many
of
the
states
would
have
the
regulations,
the
physical
effects
of
their
invalidation
are
so
great
that
even
where
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court
is
negative
in
form
even
where
it
takes
the
form
of
a
negative
injunction.
in
substance,
it
constitutes
affirmative
relief
against
the
state
government
of
the
type
proscribe
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
your
honor,
the
nature
of
the
choice
presented
the
state
governments
by
these
decisions
particularly
when
you
look
for
example
the
decision
in
california
where
physical
effects
were
in
the
order
of
$40
or
$50
million.
the
nature
of
the
choice
presented
to
the
state
government
involves
such
a
fundamental
ratio
in
a
state
expenditure
program
that
this
court
should
take
the
view
that
the
grant
of
an
injunction
even
in
negative
in
form
of
all
circumstances
is
in
the
fact
such
an
interference
with
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
as
to
be
proscribe
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes
your
honor.
the
state
has
presented
with
the
choice
either
of
creating
of
the
programs
or
making
additional
appropriation.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
degree
of
rating
of
other
programs
as
to
take
place
is
such
not
too
much
in
maryland
but
in
some
other
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
think
that's
true.
it's
less
two
in
maryland
then
it
would
be
for
example
in
west
virginia.
where
the
additional
amounts
payable
and
what
i
understand
would
be
such
that
the
cuts
would
have
to
be
much
deeper
in
the
other
programs.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
it's
a
million
dollars
in
the
maryland
and
that's
because
we
have
a
high
maximum
when
the
states
their
lower
maximums
and
high
welfare
roles
to
some
perfectly
amends.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
please.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
maryland
regulation.
regulation
of
the
state
board
of
social
services
which
has
been
in
a
fact
in
varying
forms
since
1947.
which
limits
the
total
benefits
payable
to
single
family
under
the
program
to
a
families
with
dependent
children
$250.00
per
month
subject
to
certain
exceptions
none
of
which
are
here
pertinent.
this
regulation
has
either
been
in
a
fact
or
been
under
consideration.
since
the
inception
of
state
wide
need
standards
under
the
afdc
program
in
maryland
in
1944.
their
appears
at
page
116
of
the
record
extract,
a
document
generated
of
the
time.
it
was
first
considered
imposing
state
wide
“need
standards”
and
the
last
paragraph
of
that
document
indicates
that
the
state
board
will
be
considering
the
question
of
whether
the
regulation
should
permit
the
setting
of
a
maximum
amount
above
which
no
grant
will
go,
that
appears
at
page
119
of
the
record
aspect.
subsequently
in
1947,
the
first
of
this
long
serious
maximum
grant
regulations
was
promulgate.
there
are
extensive
materials
in
the
record
here
which
relate
to
the
considerations
of
which
entered
into
the
promulgation
of
this
regulation.
the
materials
in
question
minutes
of
state
board
meetings
and
such
appear
at
pages
127
through
147
of
the
record
abstract.
i
will
not
undertake
a
detailed
summary
of
these
materials
here.
their
also
appears
at
page
165
of
the
record
abstract.
the
report
of
an
unofficial
committee
of
the
body
known
as
the
maryland
commission
on
governmentally
efficiency
in
economy
in
1948
which
shares
the
good
deal
of
light
on
the
thinking
which
entered
into
the
promulgation
of
these
maximum
grant
regulations
beginning
in
1947.
basically
the
thought
behind
the
regulation,
i
think
it's
summed
up
in
an
affidavit
of
one
of
the
veteran
officials
of
the
state
department
of
social
services,
an
affidavit
which
appears
at
page
194
of
the
record
abstract.
and
that
affidavit
states,
it
is
my
recollection
that
a
maximum
grant
regulation
has
been
in
a
fact
in
maryland
since
approximately
the
time
of
inception
of
state
wide
“need
standards”
in
1944.
it
is
also
my
recollection
that
these
maximum
grant
regulations
consist
simply
have
received
federal
approval.
i
also
recall,
that
one
factor
giving
rise
to
these
regulations
was
the
strong
feeling
on
the
part
of
many
county
boards.
particularly
during
the
period
following
adoption
of
state
wide
“need
standards”
in
1944
that
public
assistants'
payment
shall
not
--
should
not
exceed
the
earnings
of
the
head
of
a
family
when
all
for
assistance
and
that
the
income
of
a
public
assistant
recipient
should
not
exceed
that
of
his
employed
neighbors.
i
recall
that
at
various
times
during
the
early
years
following
the
introduction
of
the
maximum
grant
regulation.
the
state
department
of
public
welfare
secured
information
as
to
way
two
levels
from
the
state
employment
service
that
the
information
now
secured
with
utilized
in
establishing
maximum
grant
levels.
now,
the
maryland
regulation
is
innate,
it
finds
--
there
are
similar
regulations
in
some
20
out
of
a
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
your
honor,
that's
correct
in
one
sense.
i
think
your
honor
that
there
was
--
there
is
problem
in
--
there
was
a
problem
of
insufficient
funds.
i'd
rather
put
it
this
way.
there
was
a
problem
of
insufficient
funds
and
the
board
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
making
a
choice
between
different
means
of
carrying
out
of
reduction.
and
for
the
policy
reason
that
it
thought
that
grant
shouldn't
exceed
the
income
of
employed
families.
it
choose
the
device
of
the
maximum
grant
rather
than
the
device
of
a
presented
reduction
across
the
board
for
all
afdc
recipients
which
is
a
devised,
it's
been
employed
in
some
other
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
they're
always
insufficient
funds
in
almost
any
welfare
program.
the
question
is
where
your
--
how
you're
going
to
design
the
benefits
structure
to
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
we
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
we
suggest
that
in
addition
to
the
--
we
suggest
that
there
are
several
considerations
which
can
support
the
regulation.
one
of
them
is
the
element
of
work
incentive.
another,
is
the
undesirability
of
establishing
benefit
levels
at
levels
higher
than
prevailing
wage
rates
in
the
community
because
of
the
effect
of
this
may
have
on
families
that
are
not
on
welfare.
because
of
the
possible
incentive
to
family
breakup
which
can
be
created.
and
that
i
think
is
a
major
consideration
behind
the
present
discussion
of
welfare
reform
which
would
provide
subventions
to
employed
persons
as
well
as
unemployed
persons
that's
concern.
not
only
with
the
effect
of
the
regulations
on
people
on
welfare
but
appealing
with
this
can't
be
divorce
with
consideration,
problem
consideration,
of
the
effect
of
the
regulations
on
people
who
are
not
on
welfare.
there
is
another
answer,
i
think
to
your
question
and
that
is
that
in
speaking
of
families
that
don't
have
a
breadwinner.
you
are
speaking
of
--
there
are
some
families
from
which
the
male
head
is
absent.
there
are
other
families
which
male
head
is
present
but
a
disabled.
there're
other
families
and
which
male
head
is
present
but
unemployed.
with
respect
to
the
disable
and
unemployed
categories,
i
think
the
court
is
aware
of
the
provisions
of
the
state
unemployment
compensation
and
workman's
compensation
laws.
which
almost
invariantly
fixed
benefits
for
the
unemployed
and
for
persons
on
workman's
compensation
at
levels
that
are
fraction
of
actual
earnings.
in
maryland,
i
believe
the
fraction
is
too
big
and
this
is
done
even
though
there
are
elaborate
procedures
for
insuring
that
people
are
not
malingering
on
the
workman's
compensation
rules
or
malingering
on
the
unemployment
roles.
and
the
reason
is
i
think,
essentially
a
concession
to
administrative
imperfection.
a
feeling
that
if
you
don't
set
the
benefit
levels
at
least
somewhat
below
the
wage
level,
there
is
going
to
be
abuse.
and
i
think
that
that
feeling
also
enters
into
the
maximum
grant
regulation
even
in
its
application
to
families
which
when
you
look
at
the
main
now
appear
to
have
a
wage
enter
and
that
the
breadwinner
maybe
disabled
or
maybe
unemployed.
i
think
if
its
rational
really
under
the
workman's
compensation
and
unemployment
insurance
rules
regulations
for
that
reason
it's
rational
here.
i
should
point
out
also
that
the
maryland
regulation
has
two
elements
which
are
not
present
in
the
welfare
regulation
or
some
of
the
other
states.
one
of
them
is
that
it's
one
of
the
highest
such
regulations.
you
are
dealing
here
with
the
regulation
that
really
is
at
least
somewhat
related
to
the
minimum
wage
rate
or
the
average
wage
rate
efforts.
when
the
none
taxability
of
the
benefits,
when
the
various
forms
of
the
aid
and
kind
are
available
--
that
are
available
are
considered.
you're
talking
about
the
level
of
income
that
is
in
fact
considerable
higher
than
your
minimum
wage
or
even
your
average
wage
in
some
forms
of
employment.
that
the
second
element
and
i
think
its
worth
expressing
is
that
the
maryland
regulation
unlike
those
in
some
states
such
as
maine
and
arizona
is
a
limitation
only
on
the
amount
of
the
grant
and
not
on
the
amount
of
a
welfare
family's
budget.
that
is
to
say,
if
a
family
has
state
computed
needs
of
$350.00
and
the
maximum
of
$250.00
in
grant
is
applied
to
if
the
first
$100.00
in
earnings
by
a
member
of
that
family
maybe
retained
without
reducing
the
welfare
grant.
for
this
reason,
the
maryland
regulation
has
some
other
important
work
incentive
the
facts
which
are
not
present
in
the
regulations
of
those
states
such
as
maine
and
arizona
that
have
a
maximum
budget
limitation.
now,
the
complaint
in
this
action
made
three
claims.
the
first
was
a
claim
of
violation
of
state
law.
that
claim
is
contained
in
paragraph
vii-c
of
the
complaint.
the
second
was
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
preamble
of
the
social
security
act
of
1935,
which
was
sent
to
afford
the
basis
for
finding
that
this
regulation
was
inconsistent
with
the
social
security
act.
there
was
no
mention
made
in
the
complaint
of
any
more
specific
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
the
lower
court
in
its
initial
opinion
found
a
violation
of
section
602(a)(9)
of
the
social
security
act
and
it
conceded
on
re-argument
that
and
i
think
i
am
quoting
from
a
transcripts
on
re-argument.
the
statutory
argument
is
the
basis
of
decision
that
was
relatively
speaking
devised
by
the
court
rather
than
the
one
that
was
impressed
on
the
court
you
and
your
colleagues
addressing
plaintiffs
counsel.
that
i
think
is
true
and
on
re-argument,
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
violated
that
provision
the
social
security
act
was
withdrawn.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
was
withdrawn.
the
third
contention
was
the
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
each
of
these
three
claims
in
turn.
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
violation
of
state
law.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
ground
of
equitable
extension.
the
court
below
declines
to
abstain
and
its
oral
opinion
on
this
point
is
found
at
page
83
of
the
record
abstract.
and
it
cited
the
case
of
king
versus
smith
for
the
proposition
that
it
was
proper
for
a
federal
court
to
go
forward
with
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
irrespective
of
whether
a
state
court
by
state
construction
of
state
law
at
some
later
date
might
achieve
the
same
result.
that
language
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
king
versus
smith
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
king
v.
smith
was
concerned
with
the
fact
that
there
is
no
federal
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies.
king
versus
smith
was
concerned
with
the
exhaustion
problem.
the
question
of
equitable
abstention
in
favor
of
state
judicial
remedies
was
not
an
issue
in
king
versus
smith.
now,
it's
the
state's
position
here
that
the
claim,
that
the
regulation
was
violated
of
state
law
should've
been
regarded
as
providing
a
basis
for
equitable
abstention
in
the
favor
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
state
courts.
and
that
is
i
think
clear
from
the
cases
under
the
maryland
declaratory
judgment
act,
that
where
the
general
validity
of
state's
statute
or
regulation
is
a
sale
as
it
is
here,
that
an
action
in
a
state
courts
for
declaratory
judgment
would
lie.
state
courts
of
course
could've
determine
all
three
questions
raised
by
the
complaint.
the
federal
court
was
effectively
limited
to
the
two
federal
questions
and
the
reasons
that
you
have
this
collision
between
the
federal
court
and
the
state
regulation
was
the
failure
to
abstain
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
federal
statutory
claim
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
on
abstention
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
i
think
if
not
in
the
welfare
context
your
honor,
i
think
if
when
applies
the
tests
announced
by
this
court
in
harrison
v.
aacp
and
sheckler
v.
scooter
to
the
situation
in
this
case,
abstention
would
be
appropriate.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
construction
by
the
state
courts
of
a
none
construed
state
law
would
have
avoid
the
necessity
of
having
--
that
might
have
avoid
that
the
necessity
of
having
the
federal
court
reach
these
questions.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
open
to
them
to
raise
the
federal
questions
from
the
state
court
is
also,
of
course.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
could
your
honor.
its
no
reason
why
they
could
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there's
a
requirement
but
they
litigate
the
federal
issues
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
federal
court
should've
abstain.
with
respect
to
the
federal
statutory
claim.
there
are
i
think
three
points,
three
rule
of
fundamental
points
which
i
wish
to
make.
the
first
point
is
the
obvious
one
and
the
one
which
the
lower
court
took
no
doubt
in
its
opinion
on
re-argument.
and
that
is
that
this
statute
has
on
at
least
--
that
the
existence
of
state
maximum
grant
regulations
has
own
at
least
three
occasions
been
expressly
recognized
by
congress
in
legislation.
and
that
more
of
the
maryland
regulation
specifically
has
been
on
at
least
20
occasions
accepted
for
incorporation
in
the
state
plan
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare.
this
is
unremitting
course
of
construction
and
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
the
fate
for
example
of
the
regulation,
the
substitute
for
the
regulations
involved
in
the
case
of
king
versus
smith
when
they
were
submitted
to
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare.
and
you
had
disapproval
is
not
only
of
the
alabama
regulation
there
at
issue,
but
some
of
the
regulations.
now
the
states,
it's
quite
clear
that
contrary
to
the
claim
of
the
appellee
is
here.
the
process
of
approval
of
state
plan
amendments
by
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare,
it's
not
a
ministerial
process.
it
is
a
finding
and
it's
required
to
be
a
finding
that
the
regulation
is
in
conformity
with
the
federal
law.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
the
issue,
the
issue
your
honor
is
--
there
are
several
issues
and
i
think
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
lower
court
acted
properly.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
crucial
issue
is
whether
the
lower
court
acted
properly
in
validating
this
state
maximum
grant
regulation
on
its
phase
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
when
this
regulation
was
concededly
valid
as
to
at
least
some
of
the
people
to
whom
it
would
be
applied
and
when
it
was
supported
by
several
rational
basics.
i
think
if
i
had
to
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
believe
your
honor
that
reversal
--
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
injunction
dissolves.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
challenge
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
what
is
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
the
application
of
the
maximum.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
its
claim
that
you
cannot
have
a
family
maximum.
yes,
it's
the
claim
that
you
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
but
you
cannot
have
a
family
maximum
which
gives
a
large
family
less
than
what
its
members
is
might
be
entitle
to
if
payments
were
made
to
them
on
what
might
be
describe
as
a
per
capita
basis.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
it's
$250.00
per
month
of
the
stage.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
the
consequence
invalidation
of
this
regulation
was
that
in
order
to
pay
the
families
affected
by
of
their
full
computed
need,
the
additional
money
required
had
to
come
entirely
out
of
state
funds.
the
federal
government
matches
state
contributions
up
to
$32.00
per
recipient
and
in
maryland,
the
per
capita
expenditure
or
something
like
$37.00
per
recipient.
so
that
the
entire
additional
cost
here
had
to
come
out
of
state
funds.
i
should've
there
that
the
federal
matching
takes
place
whether
or
not
the
state
has
a
maximum
preventing
the
payment
of
additional
benefits
as
to
certain
members
of
the
family.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes
sir.
your
honor,
now
that
the
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
your
honor.
you
have
not.
but
i
should
observe
the
state
has
taken
the
appeal
from
a
finding
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
would
do
its
decision,
it
just
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that
is
what
the
lower
court
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
and
i
think
it's
a
reversal
of
what
usually
happens
in
these
case
where
there's
never
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor
and
so,
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that
your
honor
is
a
--
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
put
it
in
that
way.
i
think
our
position
is
that
courts
by
their
very
nature
can
have
the
expertise
--
can
have
the
expertise
to
apply
the
standard
of
review
that
the
appellees
here
would
have
them
applied
to
state
social
and
economic
regulations
as
be
complicated
to
effect
of
this
one.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
for
this
reason.
this
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
well,
the
lower
courts
your
honor
declined
in
terms
to
commend
that
state
to
pay
them
and
issue
to
negative
injunction
which
presented
for
the
state
with
a
abstinent
choice
of
either
finding
and
additional
million
dollars
to
pay
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
to
the
state
either
have
to
find
their
additional
million
dollars
or
would
have
been
confronted
with
alternative
of
a
4%
slash
in
all
the
welfare
payments
to
the
aged,
the
blind,
the
disabled,
and
other
families
under
the
afdc
program.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
no,
there
was
no
question
of
forfeiture
of
the
federal
contribution
here.
this
was
because
the
federal
government
will
match
only
up
to
a
certain
level
per
recipient
and
it
already
matched
up
to
that
level.
so,
any
additional
money
is
have
to
come
from
state
funds
and
this
matter
i
think
that
appears
quietly
like
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
question
would
be
this.
in
many
of
the
states
would
have
the
regulations,
the
physical
effects
of
their
invalidation
are
so
great
that
even
where
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court
is
negative
in
form
even
where
it
takes
the
form
of
a
negative
injunction.
in
substance,
it
constitutes
affirmative
relief
against
the
state
government
of
the
type
proscribe
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
your
honor,
the
nature
of
the
choice
presented
the
state
governments
by
these
decisions
particularly
when
you
look
for
example
the
decision
in
california
where
physical
effects
were
in
the
order
of
$40
or
$50
million.
the
nature
of
the
choice
presented
to
the
state
government
involves
such
a
fundamental
ratio
in
a
state
expenditure
program
that
this
court
should
take
the
view
that
the
grant
of
an
injunction
even
in
negative
in
form
of
all
circumstances
is
in
the
fact
such
an
interference
with
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
as
to
be
proscribe
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes
your
honor.
the
state
has
presented
with
the
choice
either
of
creating
of
the
programs
or
making
additional
appropriation.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
degree
of
rating
of
other
programs
as
to
take
place
is
such
not
too
much
in
maryland
but
in
some
other
states.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
and
i
think
that's
true.
it's
less
two
in
maryland
then
it
would
be
for
example
in
west
virginia.
where
the
additional
amounts
payable
and
what
i
understand
would
be
such
that
the
cuts
would
have
to
be
much
deeper
in
the
other
programs.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
it's
a
million
dollars
in
the
maryland
and
that's
because
we
have
a
high
maximum
when
the
states
their
lower
maximums
and
high
welfare
roles
to
some
perfectly
amends.
mr.
george
w.
liebmann
that's
correct
your
honor.
