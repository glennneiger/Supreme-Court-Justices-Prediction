mr.
joseph
a.
matera
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
associate
justices
of
this
court,
as
i
mentioned
to
the
various
arguments
this
morning.
i
couldn't
help
but
notice
how
two
often
labels
get
put
on
the
things
including
public
of
the
lawyers.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case
as
well,
the
state
so
often
as
we
resorted
to
labels
in
some
how
covered
over
the
real
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
point
out
from
the
very
beginning.
now,
the
essential
matter
we're
dealing
with
here
are
not
such
things
as
less
eligibility
principles,
economic
regulations.
we
are
dealing
with
the
program
of
assistance
to
needy
and
dependent
children
which
is
very
much
given
its
guidelines
in
fact
completely
by
the
social
security
act
as
implemented
in
each
state.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
here
that
this
maximum
grant
regulation
in
effect
creates
a
class
of
none
person
of
children
who
--
if
they
are
unfortunate
enough
to
be
born
the
fourth
child,
the
fifth
child
and
a
two
parent
family
with
a
six
child
and
a
one
parent
are
simply
ignored
by
the
state
and
computing
their
needs.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
state
computes
their
needs
and
then
simply
ignores
it.
we
have
here
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
this
out,
two
classes
of
individuals
created
by
this
regulation.
the
one
class
are
a
children
and
families
of
six
individuals
or
less.
the
state
computes
what
their
minimal
subsistence
needs
are
in
accordance
with
their
own
standards
and
then
pays
their
full
computed
subsistence
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
is
simply
your
honor.
it
said
out
in
the
appendix,
you
will
find
the
state
schedules
in
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
these
are
computations
by
the
state.
the
state
creates
its
own
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
its
own
standards
and
there
is
a
diminishing
rate
as
the
family
goes
larger
that's
two.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
these
computations
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
will
refer
those
around,
yes.
but
in
effect
these
computations
are
do
provide
for
the
needs
of
each
child
and
the
family
until
the
child
becomes
either
the
fifth
child
and
two
parent
family
or
the
sixth
child
in
a
one
parent
family.
and
then
the
computations
is
no
longer
provide
for
that
child.
their
needs
are
computed
but
the
state
does
not
any
longer
provide
for
their
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
not
anymore
complicated
than
that
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
schedule
which
sets
out
how
much
money
a
family
for
example
of
six
would
get?
how
a
family
of
seven
would
get?
how
much
a
family
of
eight?
this
schedule
is
contained
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
and
it
talks
about
one
person
with
a
another
individual
or
two
or
three
and
simply
computes
the
need
and
then
stops
at
$250.00.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
the
equal
protection
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
act
itself
as
social
security
act
provides
that
each
individual,
each
needy
individual
should
be
given
subsistence
needs
and
that
these
subsistence
needs
are
provided
for
needy
dependent
children
and
small
families.
but
that
once
the
family
gets
beyond
that,
the
state
completely
ignore
those
needs
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
they
are
given
nothing,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
they
give
them
--
that's
right.
they
give
him
nothing.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
and
that
in
denying
this
assistance
to
families
of
five
or
six
children
or
more
that
in
denying
assistance
of
these
children,
they
are
simply
treating
these
children
as
none
persons.
which
is
a
concept
which
this
court
denounce
then
both
levy
v.
louisiana
and
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
i
think
perhaps
if
i
turn
first
to
the
statutory
argument
that
the
matter
will
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
your
honor
is
yes
and
they
do
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
they
do
because
it's
clearly
seem
that
for
a
second,
third
or
fourth
child
that
because
they
all
live
in
the
same
family,
it
requires
less
to
take
care
of
that
period
of
fourth
child
because
that
child
shares
the
needs
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
they
can
completely
ignore
his
needs
as
this
particular
regulation
affects.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
it's
minimum
subsistence
needs
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
subsistence
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
our
argument
would
only
state
that,
you
cannot
treat
a
class
of
children
in
a
large
family
any
different,
when
you
treat
a
class
of
children
in
a
small
family,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
if
there
was
a
maximum
based
on
family
size
which
neglected
the
later
--
children
in
the
family
yes,
they
are
the
same
argument
would
prevail.
the
same
argument
would
be
made
by
us,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
state
cannot
set
a
maximum
figure
which
is
based
simply
on
arbitrary
family
size
which
denies
assistance
to
one
classification
of
needy
dependent
children
or
at
the
same
time
providing
assistance
for
the
second
class
in
this
particular
case,
children
of
small
families.
i
think,
if
we
look
at
the
social
security
act
itself
and
mr.
justice
douglas
certainly
did
i
think
said
out
the
real
issues
in
this
case.
we
have
contended
from
the
beginning
and
we
contend
here
today
that
the
two
basic
issues
in
this
case
are;
one,
that
the
maximum
grant
regulation
does
violate
the
social
security
act;
and
number
two,
that
it
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
what
way
does
it
violate
the
social
security
act?
the
very
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
itself
is
to
strengthen
family
life
and
to
keep
families
together.
congress
itself
saw
the
wisdom
of
same
toward
that
children
are
allowed
to
be
brought
up
in
their
homes.
now,
when
we
turn
to
the
stipulations
in
this
case
which
are
contained
on
page
71.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
give
special
considerations
to
the
stipulations.
we
find
this
to
be
true
that
the
gary
family
--
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
according
to
the
computations
of
the
welfare
department
itself
would
be
entitled
to
$331.00
a
month.
and
the
williams
family
according
to
the
computations
of
the
welfare
department
would
be
entitled
to
$296.00
a
month,
but
because
of
the
maximum
grant
regulation
they
are
of
course
restricted
to
$250.00.
however,
there
is
a
way
that
the
gary
family
and
the
children
of
that
family
who
are
ignored
and
treated
as
non-persons
could
receive
benefits.
and
there
is
a
way
that
the
children
in
the
williams
family
could
receive
benefits.
they
could
receive
benefits
simply
by
leaving
the
home
because
the
same
regulations
of
this
welfare
department
provide
that
if
the
gary
family
would've
place
200
children
of
12
years
old
of
between
the
ages
of
six
and
12
rather
the
children
are
younger
either
with
eligible
relatives
for
an
institutions.
each
one
of
these
children
would
be
entitled
to
$65.00
a
month
and
at
the
same
time
the
gary
family
would
continue
to
receive
the
maximum
grant
of
$250.00.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
it
would.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
at
the
same
time
that
the
williams
family,
your
honor,
should
put
if
mrs.
william
should
put
two
of
her
children
and
there
somewhat
older
over
the
age
of
12
with
eligible
relatives
or
an
institutions.
they
would
be
entitled
to
$79.00
a
month
each.
and
at
the
same
time,
mrs.
williams
would
continue
to
receive
her
grant
of
$250.00.
this
completely
undermines
the
very
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
to
keep
families
together
and
to
allow
children
to
be
brought
up
in
their
homes.
now,
this
was
completely
a
recognized
by
the
court
below
in
their
first
opinion
and
they
did
not
withdrawn
their
findings
concerning
their
appealing
of
the
statutory
violations
under
the
second
opinion.
they
felt
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
here
to
determine
whether
congress
had
ever
approved
or
not
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that.
this
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
do
not
know
sir.
the
second
basic
fundamental
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
that
we
find
violated
in
this
case
is
requirement
that
of
602
(a)(10)
which
says
that,
all
eligible
individuals
will
receive
assistance.
it
does
not
in
any
way
employer,
any
new
eligibility
requirement
to
that.
it
says,
all
eligible
individuals
and
certainly
all
of
the
children
in
those
family
are
eligible
individuals
and
this
is
a
section
of
the
social
security
act
which
this
court
in
smith
v.
king
did
pass
on
in
king
v.
smith,
i'm
sorry.
and
perhaps
justice
douglas
was
talking
about
expertise
of
this
court
and
regard
to
the
social
security
act,
i
think
that
opinion
could
be
a
points.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
think
certainly
i
would
accept
that
opinion
and
showing
a
great
deal
of
expertise,
justice
douglas
because
that
opinion
did
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
did
intend
that
all
eligible
individuals
receive
assistance.
now
obviously,
certain
eligible
children
in
these
families
are
not
receiving
assistance
and
so
for
those
two
fundamental
reasons,
we
feel
that
this
act
clearly,
this
regulation
does
clearly
violate
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
and
it
also
violates
the
state
act
which
use
of
the
very
same
language
as
the
social
security
act.
it
also
violates
what
hew
itself
has
said
about
the
purpose
of
strengthening
family
life
and
we
refer
to
that
in
our
brief
as
well.
hew
has
a
very
--
i
think
detailed
definition
of
what
the
terms
strengthening
family
life
means
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
look
to
that
in
our
appendix.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
pointed
out
earlier.
there
is
a
sort
of
diminishing
amount
that's
computed
by
the
state
as
family
gets
larger.
so,
that
it
is
recognized
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
the
equal
protection
claim
is
where
the
state
cuts
off
completely
on
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
isn't
the
difference
paid
per
child
is
to
complete
ignoring
of
the
needs
of
children
once
they
become
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
get
into
that
equal
protection
argument
as
well.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
that's
not
true
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
not
true,
it's
based
on
a
standard
of
need
and
which
these
thing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
payment
is
to
the
family
but
it's
based
on
the
needs
of
the
number
of
individuals
in
that
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
sir,
it
depends
upon
the
number
of
individual
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
would
disagree
in
this
respect
mr.
justice
white
because
the
state
does
think
about
it.
because
when
they
look
at
the
gary
family
and
the
number
of
people
in
that
family,
they
said,
"you
need
in
order
to
live
$331.00
because
the
number
of
individuals
in
your
family."
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
but
of
course
--
yes,
of
course
the
welfare
department,
i
assume,
would
believe
that
the
mother
would
take
of
those
funds
which
already
are
minimal
and
certainly
divide
in
among
the
children
because
she
would
allow
certain
children
to
starve
merely
because
their
needs
are
not
recognized
as
you
see.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct
if
the
mother
certainly
had
to
dilute
the
entire
grant.
every
child
in
the
family
would
suffer.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
we
have
eight
children
in
each
family,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
i
think
certain
states
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
instituted
ratable
reductions
they
call
it,
percentage
reduction
programs.
i
think
these
programs
are
now
under
attack.
i
think
their
certain
would
be
a
different
question
as
to
their
constitutionality
than
we
have
in
this
case.
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case,
i
think
the
case
--
the
state
was
quite
candid
when
we
began
this
case
before
the
first
opinion.
they
produced
one
witness
in
this
case
who
came
in
and
mr.
smith
and
again,
his
testimony
is
on
page
77
of
the
appendix.
but
mr.
smith's
testimony
was
quite
candid
into
the
point
that
the
purpose
of
this
maximum
ground
regulation
was
to
conserve
state
funds.
now,
i
think
my
brother
here
referred
to
several
other
people
from
the
welfare
department
who
testify
in
this
regard.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
the
equal
protection
argument
refers
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
children
of
large
families
are
not
having
their
needs
recognized
once
they
become
unfortunately
they
fail
for
the
sixth
child
on
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
in
a
fact
what
would
happen,
yes.
because
the
mother
would
not
sit
there
and
allow
other
that
or
she
would
send
the
child
out
as
she
can
do
as
i
pointed
out
under
the
act.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
your
honor
the
needs
are
basic
subsistence
needs
as
established
by
the
state
and
there
are
basic
subsistence
needs
where
families
of
each
to
compute
it
size.
and
i
think,
when
the
state
talks
about
their
rational
purposes
to
say
their
regulation
from
falling
under
the
equal
protection
case.
i
think
they
used
the
same
approach
that
the
state
did
used
in
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
case.
the
same
blond
the
bus
approached
that
they
talk
for
example
that,
the
regulations
in
somehow
incurred
is
employment.
but
when
we
look
at
the
facts
in
those
case
and
we
look
at
the
less
eligibility
principle
that
was
enunciated
in
england.
i
think
in
1825,
we
know
that
we
moved
along
way
from
then
and
this
court
in
smith
v.
king
--
king
v.
smith
did
recognized
that
we
have
a
much
more
sophisticated
and
in
line
of
welfare
program
now
which
looks
toward
rehabilitation
and
reeducation
and
retraining.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
1967
amendments
to
the
social
security
act,
clearly
provide
for
this
kind
of
an
approach
to
employment.
it
sets
up
a
very
complicated
scheme
of
a
when
program
that
requires
welfare
recipients
to
not
only
seek
retaining
but
to
seek
employment.
and
in
this
particular
light,
the
--
in
light
of
the
employment
purpose
pointed
out
by
the
state.
the
regulation
under
the
traditional
test
of
equal
protection
and
we
have
first
argued
in
our
brief
in
traditional
test
of
equal
protection.
this
purpose
is
closely
over
inclusive
for
it
would
clearly
involve
people
who
has
out
name
plaintiffs
are
not
able
to
work
both
of
our
name
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
disabled.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
applied
only
against
large
families
as
if
to
assume
that
the
heads
of
all
large
families
are
employable
but
that
small
families
and
the
heads
of
small
families
somehow
do
not
need
this
type
of
encouragement
to
work.
so,
it
is
grossly
over
inclusive,
it
is
under
inclusive
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
include
this
more
family.
so,
it
suffers
from
this
uniqueness
of
being
not
only
over
inclusive
and
but
under
inclusive.
the
exhibits
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
referred
to
some
of
their
exhibits
point
out
for
example
that
only
a
167
--
166
families
on
the
whole
welfare
program
were
assisted
with
employment.
now,
we
have
at
least
2500
families
who
were
affected
by
the
maximum
grant
regulation.
in
addition
to
that,
the
exhibits
that
have
been
put
into
this
appendix
by
the
state
also
indicate
that
even
if
all
of
the
jobs
in
maryland
were
somehow
to
be
employed
for
welfare
recipients
still
wouldn't
be
enough
jobs.
so
that
this
particular
purpose
really
has
no
viability
in
light
of
the
amendments
to
the
social
security
act.
in
addition
to
that,
the
state
talks
about
this
regulation
somehow
acting
as
a
family
stabilizer.
i
think
this
purpose
of
ironic
in
a
view
of
the
stipulations
which
show
how
a
family
is
encourage
to
disintegrate
and
instead
of
to
stay
together.
again,
it
is
over
inclusive
and
exhibit
which
the
state
itself
put
into
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
this
is
contained
on
page
154
of
the
appendix.
points
out
that
only
15%
of
families
on
welfare
are
on
welfare
because
the
head
of
the
family
dissert
it.
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
heads
of
large
families
only
no
to
dissert,
we
are
going
to
punish
85%
of
the
welfare
case
modes.
this
is
grossly
over
inclusive.
in
addition,
again,
it
has
that
uniqueness
of
being
under
inclusive
for
it
is
only
applied
against
the
heads
of
large
families.
firmly,
the
state
would
talk
about
it
being
deceptive
to
child
bearing.
well,
this
court
has
spoken
about
the
right
to
appropriation
and
marital
privacy
in
skinner
and
griswold
and
justice
douglas
as
i
know
was
quite
for
me
would
this.
and
so,
they
would
seek
to
invade
this
highly
protected
right
of
marital
privacy
and
of
right
to
procreation
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
regulation
which
again
would
affect
only
the
heads
of
large
families.
so
that
we
are
talking
about
a
purpose
which
would
begin
to
invade
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
of
appropriation
and
the
right
to
marital
privacy.
and
this
gets
into
the
ladder
part
of
our
equal
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
which
is
that
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
your
honor
in
the
case
of
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
for
example,
all
of
their
children
were
born
prior
to
the
time
they
were
on
welfare.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
all
of
them
were
born
prior
to
the
time
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
were
required
to
seek
welfare
assistance.
the
same
thing
is
to
with
mrs.
williams.
so
in
effect,
they
are
being
punished
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
we
would
still
maintain
that
it
is
an
evasion
here
of
marital
privacy
and
the
right
to
procreation.
we
still
have
to
maintain
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
case
in
this
sense
that
we
are
punishing
the
parents
of
children
for
an
act
which
they
had
a
perfect
legitimate
right
to
exercise
even
prior
to
the
time
that
they
will
require
to
seek
welfare
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
right
has
no
different
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
is
only
relevant
in
this
case
to
point
out
how
would
affects
families
who
perhaps
have
already
had
their
children
prior
to
the
time
they
go
on
welfare.
they
are
being
punished
for
exercising
that
right
even
before
they
needed
welfare
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
they're
being
punished
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
because
their
family
have
to
be
of
a
certain
size,
certain
children
in
that
family
are
simply
considered
none
persons.
they
are
not
given
any
assistance
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
your
honor
that
wouldn't
be
part
of
our
premise
at
all.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
it
wouldn't
be
part
of
our
argument
at
all.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
not
at
all.
your
honor,
we
have
maintained
that
this
regulation
is
unconstitutional
under
the
traditional
test.
but
we
would
maintain
that
this
court
should
apply
the
special
scrutiny
or
compelling
state
interest
test
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
fundamental
rights
involved
here.
now,
i
have
already
talked
about
the
right
to
narrow
privacy
and
to
appropriate.
however,
the
regulation
also
creates
a
suspect
classification.
a
classification
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
levy
v.
louisiana.
as
soon
as
a
child
is
unfortunate
enough
under
this
regulation
to
be
born
to
fifth
child
of
a
two
parent
family
or
the
sixth
child
of
a
one
parent
family.
he
is
at
that
time,
put
into
a
suspect
classification
in
that
welfare
assistance
is
that
that
point
denied
to
him.
this
court
has
struck
down
such
classifications
in
levy
v.
louisiana
as
well
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
we
would
maintain
that
because
the
regulation
creates
a
suspect
classification.
the
traditional
test
should
not
be
applied
here
but
that
the
compelling
interest
or
a
special
scrutiny
test
should
be
applied.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
welfare
check
your
honor
goes
to
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
your
honor,
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
practical
effect
would
be
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
would
be
the
practical
effect
because
a
parent
would
simply
not
let
its
child
starve.
because
we
feel
the
compelling
interest
test
is
appropriate
here.
the
state
must
look
to
less
on
these
alternatives
and
we
are
fortunate
here
and
not
to
have
to
talk
about
how
these
less
owners
alternatives
could
be
devised
because
they
have
already
been
devised.
the
1967
amendment
to
the
social
security
act
do
provide
for
a
win
program.
they
do
provide
for
means
to
find
husbands
and
fathers
who
should
be
supporting
children
and
they
provide
for
a
family
program
of
control
of
family
size.
so
that
all
of
the
owners
alternative
already
exist.
in
closing,
i
would
just
say
that
as
this
court
found
in
king
v.
smith
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
associate
justices
of
this
court,
as
i
mentioned
to
the
various
arguments
this
morning.
i
couldn't
help
but
notice
how
two
often
labels
get
put
on
the
things
including
public
of
the
lawyers.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case
as
well,
the
state
so
often
as
we
resorted
to
labels
in
some
how
covered
over
the
real
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
point
out
from
the
very
beginning.
now,
the
essential
matter
we're
dealing
with
here
are
not
such
things
as
less
eligibility
principles,
economic
regulations.
we
are
dealing
with
the
program
of
assistance
to
needy
and
dependent
children
which
is
very
much
given
its
guidelines
in
fact
completely
by
the
social
security
act
as
implemented
in
each
state.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
here
that
this
maximum
grant
regulation
in
effect
creates
a
class
of
none
person
of
children
who
--
if
they
are
unfortunate
enough
to
be
born
the
fourth
child,
the
fifth
child
and
a
two
parent
family
with
a
six
child
and
a
one
parent
are
simply
ignored
by
the
state
and
computing
their
needs.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
state
computes
their
needs
and
then
simply
ignores
it.
we
have
here
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
this
out,
two
classes
of
individuals
created
by
this
regulation.
the
one
class
are
a
children
and
families
of
six
individuals
or
less.
the
state
computes
what
their
minimal
subsistence
needs
are
in
accordance
with
their
own
standards
and
then
pays
their
full
computed
subsistence
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
is
simply
your
honor.
it
said
out
in
the
appendix,
you
will
find
the
state
schedules
in
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
these
are
computations
by
the
state.
the
state
creates
its
own
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
its
own
standards
and
there
is
a
diminishing
rate
as
the
family
goes
larger
that's
two.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
these
computations
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
will
refer
those
around,
yes.
but
in
effect
these
computations
are
do
provide
for
the
needs
of
each
child
and
the
family
until
the
child
becomes
either
the
fifth
child
and
two
parent
family
or
the
sixth
child
in
a
one
parent
family.
and
then
the
computations
is
no
longer
provide
for
that
child.
their
needs
are
computed
but
the
state
does
not
any
longer
provide
for
their
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
not
anymore
complicated
than
that
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
schedule
which
sets
out
how
much
money
a
family
for
example
of
six
would
get?
how
a
family
of
seven
would
get?
how
much
a
family
of
eight?
this
schedule
is
contained
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
and
it
talks
about
one
person
with
a
another
individual
or
two
or
three
and
simply
computes
the
need
and
then
stops
at
$250.00.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
the
equal
protection
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
act
itself
as
social
security
act
provides
that
each
individual,
each
needy
individual
should
be
given
subsistence
needs
and
that
these
subsistence
needs
are
provided
for
needy
dependent
children
and
small
families.
but
that
once
the
family
gets
beyond
that,
the
state
completely
ignore
those
needs
and
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
they
are
given
nothing,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
they
give
them
--
that's
right.
they
give
him
nothing.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
and
that
in
denying
this
assistance
to
families
of
five
or
six
children
or
more
that
in
denying
assistance
of
these
children,
they
are
simply
treating
these
children
as
none
persons.
which
is
a
concept
which
this
court
denounce
then
both
levy
v.
louisiana
and
in
shapiro
v.
thompson.
i
think
perhaps
if
i
turn
first
to
the
statutory
argument
that
the
matter
will
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
your
honor
is
yes
and
they
do
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
they
do
because
it's
clearly
seem
that
for
a
second,
third
or
fourth
child
that
because
they
all
live
in
the
same
family,
it
requires
less
to
take
care
of
that
period
of
fourth
child
because
that
child
shares
the
needs
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
they
can
completely
ignore
his
needs
as
this
particular
regulation
affects.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
it's
minimum
subsistence
needs
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
subsistence
needs.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
our
argument
would
only
state
that,
you
cannot
treat
a
class
of
children
in
a
large
family
any
different,
when
you
treat
a
class
of
children
in
a
small
family,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
if
there
was
a
maximum
based
on
family
size
which
neglected
the
later
--
children
in
the
family
yes,
they
are
the
same
argument
would
prevail.
the
same
argument
would
be
made
by
us,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
state
cannot
set
a
maximum
figure
which
is
based
simply
on
arbitrary
family
size
which
denies
assistance
to
one
classification
of
needy
dependent
children
or
at
the
same
time
providing
assistance
for
the
second
class
in
this
particular
case,
children
of
small
families.
i
think,
if
we
look
at
the
social
security
act
itself
and
mr.
justice
douglas
certainly
did
i
think
said
out
the
real
issues
in
this
case.
we
have
contended
from
the
beginning
and
we
contend
here
today
that
the
two
basic
issues
in
this
case
are;
one,
that
the
maximum
grant
regulation
does
violate
the
social
security
act;
and
number
two,
that
it
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
what
way
does
it
violate
the
social
security
act?
the
very
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
itself
is
to
strengthen
family
life
and
to
keep
families
together.
congress
itself
saw
the
wisdom
of
same
toward
that
children
are
allowed
to
be
brought
up
in
their
homes.
now,
when
we
turn
to
the
stipulations
in
this
case
which
are
contained
on
page
71.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
give
special
considerations
to
the
stipulations.
we
find
this
to
be
true
that
the
gary
family
--
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
according
to
the
computations
of
the
welfare
department
itself
would
be
entitled
to
$331.00
a
month.
and
the
williams
family
according
to
the
computations
of
the
welfare
department
would
be
entitled
to
$296.00
a
month,
but
because
of
the
maximum
grant
regulation
they
are
of
course
restricted
to
$250.00.
however,
there
is
a
way
that
the
gary
family
and
the
children
of
that
family
who
are
ignored
and
treated
as
non-persons
could
receive
benefits.
and
there
is
a
way
that
the
children
in
the
williams
family
could
receive
benefits.
they
could
receive
benefits
simply
by
leaving
the
home
because
the
same
regulations
of
this
welfare
department
provide
that
if
the
gary
family
would've
place
200
children
of
12
years
old
of
between
the
ages
of
six
and
12
rather
the
children
are
younger
either
with
eligible
relatives
for
an
institutions.
each
one
of
these
children
would
be
entitled
to
$65.00
a
month
and
at
the
same
time
the
gary
family
would
continue
to
receive
the
maximum
grant
of
$250.00.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
it
would.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
at
the
same
time
that
the
williams
family,
your
honor,
should
put
if
mrs.
william
should
put
two
of
her
children
and
there
somewhat
older
over
the
age
of
12
with
eligible
relatives
or
an
institutions.
they
would
be
entitled
to
$79.00
a
month
each.
and
at
the
same
time,
mrs.
williams
would
continue
to
receive
her
grant
of
$250.00.
this
completely
undermines
the
very
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
to
keep
families
together
and
to
allow
children
to
be
brought
up
in
their
homes.
now,
this
was
completely
a
recognized
by
the
court
below
in
their
first
opinion
and
they
did
not
withdrawn
their
findings
concerning
their
appealing
of
the
statutory
violations
under
the
second
opinion.
they
felt
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
here
to
determine
whether
congress
had
ever
approved
or
not
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that.
this
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
do
not
know
sir.
the
second
basic
fundamental
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
that
we
find
violated
in
this
case
is
requirement
that
of
602
(a)(10)
which
says
that,
all
eligible
individuals
will
receive
assistance.
it
does
not
in
any
way
employer,
any
new
eligibility
requirement
to
that.
it
says,
all
eligible
individuals
and
certainly
all
of
the
children
in
those
family
are
eligible
individuals
and
this
is
a
section
of
the
social
security
act
which
this
court
in
smith
v.
king
did
pass
on
in
king
v.
smith,
i'm
sorry.
and
perhaps
justice
douglas
was
talking
about
expertise
of
this
court
and
regard
to
the
social
security
act,
i
think
that
opinion
could
be
a
points.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
think
certainly
i
would
accept
that
opinion
and
showing
a
great
deal
of
expertise,
justice
douglas
because
that
opinion
did
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
did
intend
that
all
eligible
individuals
receive
assistance.
now
obviously,
certain
eligible
children
in
these
families
are
not
receiving
assistance
and
so
for
those
two
fundamental
reasons,
we
feel
that
this
act
clearly,
this
regulation
does
clearly
violate
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
and
it
also
violates
the
state
act
which
use
of
the
very
same
language
as
the
social
security
act.
it
also
violates
what
hew
itself
has
said
about
the
purpose
of
strengthening
family
life
and
we
refer
to
that
in
our
brief
as
well.
hew
has
a
very
--
i
think
detailed
definition
of
what
the
terms
strengthening
family
life
means
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
look
to
that
in
our
appendix.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
pointed
out
earlier.
there
is
a
sort
of
diminishing
amount
that's
computed
by
the
state
as
family
gets
larger.
so,
that
it
is
recognized
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
the
equal
protection
claim
is
where
the
state
cuts
off
completely
on
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
isn't
the
difference
paid
per
child
is
to
complete
ignoring
of
the
needs
of
children
once
they
become
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
get
into
that
equal
protection
argument
as
well.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
that's
not
true
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
not
true,
it's
based
on
a
standard
of
need
and
which
these
thing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
payment
is
to
the
family
but
it's
based
on
the
needs
of
the
number
of
individuals
in
that
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no
sir,
it
depends
upon
the
number
of
individual
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
i
would
disagree
in
this
respect
mr.
justice
white
because
the
state
does
think
about
it.
because
when
they
look
at
the
gary
family
and
the
number
of
people
in
that
family,
they
said,
"you
need
in
order
to
live
$331.00
because
the
number
of
individuals
in
your
family."
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes,
but
of
course
--
yes,
of
course
the
welfare
department,
i
assume,
would
believe
that
the
mother
would
take
of
those
funds
which
already
are
minimal
and
certainly
divide
in
among
the
children
because
she
would
allow
certain
children
to
starve
merely
because
their
needs
are
not
recognized
as
you
see.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
correct
if
the
mother
certainly
had
to
dilute
the
entire
grant.
every
child
in
the
family
would
suffer.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
we
have
eight
children
in
each
family,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
i
think
certain
states
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
instituted
ratable
reductions
they
call
it,
percentage
reduction
programs.
i
think
these
programs
are
now
under
attack.
i
think
their
certain
would
be
a
different
question
as
to
their
constitutionality
than
we
have
in
this
case.
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case,
i
think
the
case
--
the
state
was
quite
candid
when
we
began
this
case
before
the
first
opinion.
they
produced
one
witness
in
this
case
who
came
in
and
mr.
smith
and
again,
his
testimony
is
on
page
77
of
the
appendix.
but
mr.
smith's
testimony
was
quite
candid
into
the
point
that
the
purpose
of
this
maximum
ground
regulation
was
to
conserve
state
funds.
now,
i
think
my
brother
here
referred
to
several
other
people
from
the
welfare
department
who
testify
in
this
regard.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
the
equal
protection
argument
refers
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
children
of
large
families
are
not
having
their
needs
recognized
once
they
become
unfortunately
they
fail
for
the
sixth
child
on
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
in
a
fact
what
would
happen,
yes.
because
the
mother
would
not
sit
there
and
allow
other
that
or
she
would
send
the
child
out
as
she
can
do
as
i
pointed
out
under
the
act.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
your
honor
the
needs
are
basic
subsistence
needs
as
established
by
the
state
and
there
are
basic
subsistence
needs
where
families
of
each
to
compute
it
size.
and
i
think,
when
the
state
talks
about
their
rational
purposes
to
say
their
regulation
from
falling
under
the
equal
protection
case.
i
think
they
used
the
same
approach
that
the
state
did
used
in
the
shapiro
v.
thompson
case.
the
same
blond
the
bus
approached
that
they
talk
for
example
that,
the
regulations
in
somehow
incurred
is
employment.
but
when
we
look
at
the
facts
in
those
case
and
we
look
at
the
less
eligibility
principle
that
was
enunciated
in
england.
i
think
in
1825,
we
know
that
we
moved
along
way
from
then
and
this
court
in
smith
v.
king
--
king
v.
smith
did
recognized
that
we
have
a
much
more
sophisticated
and
in
line
of
welfare
program
now
which
looks
toward
rehabilitation
and
reeducation
and
retraining.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
1967
amendments
to
the
social
security
act,
clearly
provide
for
this
kind
of
an
approach
to
employment.
it
sets
up
a
very
complicated
scheme
of
a
when
program
that
requires
welfare
recipients
to
not
only
seek
retaining
but
to
seek
employment.
and
in
this
particular
light,
the
--
in
light
of
the
employment
purpose
pointed
out
by
the
state.
the
regulation
under
the
traditional
test
of
equal
protection
and
we
have
first
argued
in
our
brief
in
traditional
test
of
equal
protection.
this
purpose
is
closely
over
inclusive
for
it
would
clearly
involve
people
who
has
out
name
plaintiffs
are
not
able
to
work
both
of
our
name
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
disabled.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
applied
only
against
large
families
as
if
to
assume
that
the
heads
of
all
large
families
are
employable
but
that
small
families
and
the
heads
of
small
families
somehow
do
not
need
this
type
of
encouragement
to
work.
so,
it
is
grossly
over
inclusive,
it
is
under
inclusive
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
include
this
more
family.
so,
it
suffers
from
this
uniqueness
of
being
not
only
over
inclusive
and
but
under
inclusive.
the
exhibits
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
referred
to
some
of
their
exhibits
point
out
for
example
that
only
a
167
--
166
families
on
the
whole
welfare
program
were
assisted
with
employment.
now,
we
have
at
least
2500
families
who
were
affected
by
the
maximum
grant
regulation.
in
addition
to
that,
the
exhibits
that
have
been
put
into
this
appendix
by
the
state
also
indicate
that
even
if
all
of
the
jobs
in
maryland
were
somehow
to
be
employed
for
welfare
recipients
still
wouldn't
be
enough
jobs.
so
that
this
particular
purpose
really
has
no
viability
in
light
of
the
amendments
to
the
social
security
act.
in
addition
to
that,
the
state
talks
about
this
regulation
somehow
acting
as
a
family
stabilizer.
i
think
this
purpose
of
ironic
in
a
view
of
the
stipulations
which
show
how
a
family
is
encourage
to
disintegrate
and
instead
of
to
stay
together.
again,
it
is
over
inclusive
and
exhibit
which
the
state
itself
put
into
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
this
is
contained
on
page
154
of
the
appendix.
points
out
that
only
15%
of
families
on
welfare
are
on
welfare
because
the
head
of
the
family
dissert
it.
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
heads
of
large
families
only
no
to
dissert,
we
are
going
to
punish
85%
of
the
welfare
case
modes.
this
is
grossly
over
inclusive.
in
addition,
again,
it
has
that
uniqueness
of
being
under
inclusive
for
it
is
only
applied
against
the
heads
of
large
families.
firmly,
the
state
would
talk
about
it
being
deceptive
to
child
bearing.
well,
this
court
has
spoken
about
the
right
to
appropriation
and
marital
privacy
in
skinner
and
griswold
and
justice
douglas
as
i
know
was
quite
for
me
would
this.
and
so,
they
would
seek
to
invade
this
highly
protected
right
of
marital
privacy
and
of
right
to
procreation
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
regulation
which
again
would
affect
only
the
heads
of
large
families.
so
that
we
are
talking
about
a
purpose
which
would
begin
to
invade
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
of
appropriation
and
the
right
to
marital
privacy.
and
this
gets
into
the
ladder
part
of
our
equal
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
which
is
that
sir?
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
well,
your
honor
in
the
case
of
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
for
example,
all
of
their
children
were
born
prior
to
the
time
they
were
on
welfare.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
all
of
them
were
born
prior
to
the
time
mr.
and
mrs.
gary
were
required
to
seek
welfare
assistance.
the
same
thing
is
to
with
mrs.
williams.
so
in
effect,
they
are
being
punished
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor,
we
would
still
maintain
that
it
is
an
evasion
here
of
marital
privacy
and
the
right
to
procreation.
we
still
have
to
maintain
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
case
in
this
sense
that
we
are
punishing
the
parents
of
children
for
an
act
which
they
had
a
perfect
legitimate
right
to
exercise
even
prior
to
the
time
that
they
will
require
to
seek
welfare
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
right
has
no
different
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
it
is
only
relevant
in
this
case
to
point
out
how
would
affects
families
who
perhaps
have
already
had
their
children
prior
to
the
time
they
go
on
welfare.
they
are
being
punished
for
exercising
that
right
even
before
they
needed
welfare
assistance.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes.
they're
being
punished
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
because
their
family
have
to
be
of
a
certain
size,
certain
children
in
that
family
are
simply
considered
none
persons.
they
are
not
given
any
assistance
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
your
honor
that
wouldn't
be
part
of
our
premise
at
all.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
it
wouldn't
be
part
of
our
argument
at
all.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
not
at
all.
your
honor,
we
have
maintained
that
this
regulation
is
unconstitutional
under
the
traditional
test.
but
we
would
maintain
that
this
court
should
apply
the
special
scrutiny
or
compelling
state
interest
test
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
fundamental
rights
involved
here.
now,
i
have
already
talked
about
the
right
to
narrow
privacy
and
to
appropriate.
however,
the
regulation
also
creates
a
suspect
classification.
a
classification
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
levy
v.
louisiana.
as
soon
as
a
child
is
unfortunate
enough
under
this
regulation
to
be
born
to
fifth
child
of
a
two
parent
family
or
the
sixth
child
of
a
one
parent
family.
he
is
at
that
time,
put
into
a
suspect
classification
in
that
welfare
assistance
is
that
that
point
denied
to
him.
this
court
has
struck
down
such
classifications
in
levy
v.
louisiana
as
well
as
in
shapiro
v.
thompson
and
we
would
maintain
that
because
the
regulation
creates
a
suspect
classification.
the
traditional
test
should
not
be
applied
here
but
that
the
compelling
interest
or
a
special
scrutiny
test
should
be
applied.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
the
welfare
check
your
honor
goes
to
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
yes
your
honor,
the
head
of
the
family.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
practical
effect
would
be
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
that
would
be
the
practical
effect
because
a
parent
would
simply
not
let
its
child
starve.
because
we
feel
the
compelling
interest
test
is
appropriate
here.
the
state
must
look
to
less
on
these
alternatives
and
we
are
fortunate
here
and
not
to
have
to
talk
about
how
these
less
owners
alternatives
could
be
devised
because
they
have
already
been
devised.
the
1967
amendment
to
the
social
security
act
do
provide
for
a
win
program.
they
do
provide
for
means
to
find
husbands
and
fathers
who
should
be
supporting
children
and
they
provide
for
a
family
program
of
control
of
family
size.
so
that
all
of
the
owners
alternative
already
exist.
in
closing,
i
would
just
say
that
as
this
court
found
in
king
v.
smith
--
mr.
joseph
a.
matera
thank
you,
your
honor.
