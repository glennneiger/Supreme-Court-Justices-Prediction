on
this
is
following
up
on
rather
brother
douglas'
question,
the
reason
for
the
state
court's
first
of
all
paragraph
--sustained
contention
with
the
recipients
on
the
statutory
language
was
and
i
believe
the
examination
you
said
without
a
mark
him.
but
has
gone
to
statutory
language,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
without
more
backtrack
or
expertise
with
everyone
to
go?
justice

that

have
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
have

way

the

of

court
consideration
may

would
state
the
constitutional
question,

that's

on
this
case.

i
wonder
if
we

justice
william
j.

i
though
you
answer
this
question
of
mr.
justice
black
is
asking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
i
asked
you
before,
the
idea
is
that
there's
only
one
child
the
computation
of
what
the
bare
minimum
subsistence
requirement
for
that
child
is
maybe
$30.00
let's
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say
two
children
that
bares
subsistence
requirement
for
the
first
maybe
$30.00,
but
because
there
are
two
children
but
the
bare
subsistence
requirement
for
the
second
child
maybe
only
$25.00,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
go
on
down
$30.00,
$25.00,
$20.00
for
the
third
child
perhaps
$15.00
for
the
fourth
child,
that's
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
once
you
get
up
to
the
total
of
$250.00.
if
there
are
fifth,
sixth,
seven
children,
even
though
they
compute
what
the
bare
subsistence
requirement
for
the
fifth,
sixth
and
the
seventh
children
maybe.
they
make
no
provision
for
payment
to
the
family
for
those
--,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
in
cutting
out
which
is
the
effect
of
the
$250
maximum,
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
children
is
the
denial
of
equal
protection
as
between
them
and
the
first,
second
and
third,
fourth
children.
