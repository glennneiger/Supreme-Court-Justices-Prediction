justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
something
different
was
involved?
certainly,
we
don't
sit
to
pass
judgment
on
whether
the
large
number
of
protest
result
in
revocation
of
classification.
we
are
only
concerned
with
this
man
and
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
or
statutory
requirement,
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
what
the
district
court
said
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
true.
justice
william

douglas
it
seems
to
be
that
would
be
the
narrowest
one,
--
as
a
matter
of
statutory,
not
constitutional.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
why,
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
oestereich
case,
reading
the
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
it
didn't
seem
to
be
that
the
attack
made
by
this
petitioner
was
more
massive
and
the
one
made
by
the
solicitor
general
who
i
see
is
absent
from
this
particular
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
you're
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
