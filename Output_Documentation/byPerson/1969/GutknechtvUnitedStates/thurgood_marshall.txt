justice
thurgood

in
this
case,
the
man
had
actually
has
his
draft
card
stolen
from
him,
or
burned,
or
lost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
notice
says
this
didn't
come
to
him,
the
only
thing
came
to
the
board's
attention
was
he
didn't
have
his
card.
under
these
regulations,
is
it
not
probable,
but
is
it
possible
that
a
board
could
accelerate
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
have
offered
a
new
draft
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
suggested
that
he
apply
for
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
regulation
don't
get
any
of
that
protection,
none.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
board.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
in
point
at
words,
may
as
if
the
authority
that
the
board
has,
uncontrolled
authority.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wonder
if
the
breen
case,
i
would
assume
that
he
couldn't
get
into
court
before
that,
could
he?
your
position
in
the
breen
case,
he
couldn't
have
litigated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
when
he
was
classified
and
gotten
--
that
notice
in
five
days
to
report.
he
couldn't
have
litigated
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
in
this
case.
this
man
could
litigate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
this
man
in
this
case
test
out
the
discretion
of
the
draft
board,
legally
and
of
course
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
the
only
way
he
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
won't
help
this
man's
four
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
real
difficulty
is
that
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
confesses
error
is
up
to
one
person,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
his
uncontrolled
discretion.
we
had
the
uncontrolled
discretion
to
the
board,
controlled
only
by
the
uncontrolled
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
only
raised
it
because
you
said
that's
what
cured
the
discretion
of
the
draft
board.
that's
the
only
reason
i'm
raising.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
case
like
this
could
cure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
raise
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
blocks
it?
you
didn't
it
block
it,
you
let
him
raise
it
and
now
it's
up
to
you,
that's
the
way
you
should
think
it
should
be
done.
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that
position,
for
me
to
take.
