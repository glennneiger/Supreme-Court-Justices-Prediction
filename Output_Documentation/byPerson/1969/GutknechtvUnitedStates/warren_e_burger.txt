you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
petitioner's
classification
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
anything
about
how
long
the
time
is
involved
in
processing
appeals
in
that
particular
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
of
your
case
depends
upon
whether
he
did
or
did
not
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
he
did,
if
he
did
not
refuse
to
submit
to
induction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
perhaps,
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear
enough,
mr.
tigar.
if
the
man
presents
himself
at
the
induction
center
and
let
us
say
refuses
to
take
the
medical
examination
or
refuses
to
fill
out
forms,
as
he
refused
to
comply
with
induction
orders.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
an
offense
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
i
understand
that
you're
to
say
that
he
did
not
refuse
to
comply
with
induction
orders,
which
the
statute
contemplates
to
make
out
an
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
was
that
raised
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
position
that
every
destruction
or
failure
to
carry
a
draft
card
in
possession
is
an
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
it's
surrender,
the
act
of
surrendering
falls
in
that
category,
does
that
mean
the
actor
is
forever
thereafter
excused
from
complying
with
the
requirement
to
carry
the
draft
card
in
its
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
they
need
a
regulation
of
any
kind
to
guide
the
board
in
what
to
do
if
a
trashed
card
turns
up
under
some
lost
and
found
process?
do
they
need
a
regulation
to
tell
the
board
to
send
that
card
to
the
registrant
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
a
difference
in
that
situation,
whether
the
board
was
aware
that
it
had
been
a
deliberate
disposition
of
the
card,
as
compared
within
inadvertent
loss
of
the
card?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
i
understand
you
to
be
suggesting
that
if
the
card
shows
up
that
the
board
by
any
process,
they
must
hold
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
was
lost
or
deliberately
thrown
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ruckelshaus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ruckleshaus,
are
you
saying
to
us
that
any
registrant,
any
draft
registrant
who
loses
his
card
or
is
otherwise
dispossessed
of
it
through
inadvertence
and
not
intent
has
the
key
to
the
solution
of
his
problem
by
simply
getting
another
card
and
putting
himself
back
in
compliance
at
any
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
ruckelshaus.
mr.
tigar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
in
the
trial,
in
the
district
court
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
finding
of
willfulness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
the
same
token
the
standard
of
proof
on
the
government
is
infinitely
higher,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
understand
that
argument
a
great
deal
better
if
you
were
arguing
to
us
that
when
he
received
his
delinquency
notice,
he
had
asked
for
a
hearing
and
had
been
refused
a
hearing
but
he
did
not
ask,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
not
tested
out
by
asking
for
it,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.

thank
you

your
