stewart
but
it
was
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
the
duty
of
the

send
somebody
another

that

justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
registrant
who
loses
his

it's
really
his

negligence
or
carelessness
or
because
it's
stolen
or
something
that
can
apply

get
a
new
one.
justice

well,
if
that
was
here
say
evidence,

this
--
i'm
looking
at
page
30
of
the
appendix,
which
is
an
opinion
of
the
court

which
indicates
that
there
was
contained
in
the
selective

board
file
in
this
case,
the
information
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the

separated

justice

there
was
information
in

this
is
accurately
reproduced
here
in
the

as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
this
man
and
his
draft
card
became
separated,
is
that
correct?
justice

stewart
indicating
a
willful
separation
on
his

is
contrasted
to
a
careless
or
negligent
or
accidental
one.
justice

i
understood
you
say
that
there
was
none,
i
just
wanted

that's
what
i
gather
from

stewart
the
court

had
written
that
he
was
permitted
to
do
so?
justice
