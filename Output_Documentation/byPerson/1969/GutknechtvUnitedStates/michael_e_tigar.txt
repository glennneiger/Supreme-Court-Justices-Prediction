mr.
michael
e.
tigar
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
serious
question,
here
in
oestereich
against
the
selective
service
board,
but
not
decided
in
that
case.
of
whether
the
selective
service
system
is
being
used
to
punish
or
sanction
this
ancient
behavior
without
due
process,
without
congressional
authorization
and
on
the
standards
so
vague
and
broad
as
to
offend
the
first
amendment.
there
is
in
addition
here,
two
serious
questions,
there
are
here
two
serious
questions,
concerning
criminal
procedure
in
the
9.7%
of
all
federal
criminal
prosecutions,
which
are
represented
by
selective
service
prosecutions
today.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
9.7%
i
believe
in
the
last
report.
the
petitioner,
david
gutknecht
anticipated
in
an
antiwar,
anti-draft
demonstration
on
the
16th
of
october,
1967,
in
the
course
of
which
he
dropped
his
registration
certificate
and
notice
of
classification,
along
with
the
mimeograph
statement
of
position
on
the
vietnam
war
and
conscription,
at
the
feet
of
the
united
states
martial,
in
front
of
the
federal
building
in
minneapolis.
eight
days
later,
on
the
24th
of
october,
1967,
general
hershey,
the
director
of
the
selective
service
system,
issued
the
letter
to
all
local
boards
and
local
board
memorandum
number
85,
which
are
reprinted
in
appendix
b
to
the
petitioner's
brief
which
was
an
issue
in
oestereich.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
at
that
time
mr.
chief
justice
he
was
classified
1-a,
although
he
had
an
appeal
pending,
which
meant
that
he
could
not
be
inducted.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
does
not.
the
average
time
is
a
meaningless
figure.
it
varies
greatly
depending
on
the
workload.
those
figures
are
collected
most
recently
in
the
marshall
commission
report
in
pursuit
of
equity.
the
local
board
memorandum
and
letter,
urged
local
boards
to
use
the
delinquency
power
to
reclassify
and
order
for
priority
induction,
registrants
who
engaged
in
illegal
demonstrations.
as
soon
as
it
could
under
the
regulations,
the
petitioner's
board
on
december
21,
1967,
sent
him
a
delinquency
notice,
reprinted
at
page
44
of
the
appendix.
and
a
weekend,
a
day
and
christmas
day
after
that,
sent
him
an
order
to
report
for
priority
induction.
taking
him
out
of
his
statutorily
and
regulatory
mandated
position
in
the
order
of
call
and
ordering
him
for
military
service,
ahead
of
the
time,
when
he
would
otherwise
have
to
report.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
if
it
had
been
pending
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
have
been
illegal.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
under
the
regulations.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
was
not
pending.
the
petitioner
concededly
reported
for
induction,
but
did
not
obey
the
orders
of
the
induction
center
officials
relating
to
his
processing.
a
prosecution
for
refusal
to
report
for
and
submit
to
induction
followed
then,
he
is
currently
under
sentence
of
four
years
imprisonment.
the
delinquency
regulations,
if
the
court
please,
provide
that
when
a
registrant
fails
to
perform
any
duty,
a
term
given
no
further
definition,
under
the
act
or
regulations,
he
may
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
board
be
declared
delinquent.
if
he
is
to
further
exempt,
he
may
again
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
board
be
classified
in
the
class
available
for
service.
if
he's
already
1-a,
he
is
sent
to
the
head
of
the
list
for
induction.
now,
if
he
is
reclassified
out
of
the
deferred
or
exempt
status,
he
has
a
personal
appearance
before
the
board
and
an
appeal.
if
like
the
petitioner,
he
is
already
1-a,
he
is
entitled
to
no
hearing
whatever
before
the
local
board
under
the
regulations.
say
that
hearing
which
the
board
in
its
absolute
discretion
may
choose
to
give
him.
the
decision
to
declare,
retain,
or
remit
delinquency
status,
resides
under
the
regulations
in
the
discretion
of
the
board.
it's
our
contention,
set
forth
in
our
brief,
that
this
kind
of
administrative
sanctioning
procedure,
involving
the
summary
deprival
of
a
benefit
or
privilege,
under
a
regulatory
system,
knows
no
parallel
in
federal
administrative
law
today.
and
when
coupled
with
administration
under
the
broad
ranging
directive
of
the
director
of
selective
service
to
have
local
boards
reach
out
to
get
at
the
sanctioned
behavior,
the
regulations
have
a
fearsome
deterrent
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
protected
freedoms.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
our
case
depends
not
at
all
upon
that
point.
we
do
of
course
contend
that
the
regulations
impose
punishment
and
therefore,
he
was
entitled
to
a
judicial
trial.
second,
that
they
impose
a
sanction
at
least
and
he
is
entitled
to
due
process
and
adversary
hearing.
but,
even
if
the
court
should
decide
those
questions
against
us,
we
believe
that
green
and
mcelroy
compels
reversal
here.
green
and
mcelroy
will
be
recalled,
did
not
require
the
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
all
the
court
held
was
that
given
our
presumption
in
favor
of
fairness,
we
would
not
presume
that
the
congress
authorized
an
administrative
agency
to
dispense
with
these
fundamental
procedural
decencies,
without
an
expressed
statement
by
the
congress
and
an
expressed
statement
by
the
president
of
an
intention
to
do
so.
and
if
the
court
were
to
adapt
that
position,
which
seems
to
me
sensible
and
supported
by
the
former
decisions
of
the
court,
the
constitutional
issue
need
not
be
reached.
however,
we
do
believe
that
if
the
constitutional
issue
must
be
reached,
should
be
decided
in
our
favor.
these
regulations
in
their
purpose,
their
language,
their
administration,
and
their
effect
are
punitive.
even
the
government
cannot
evade
this
issue
and
it's
brief
that
a
search
on
the
one
hand
that
they
are
not
punitive
and
in
the
appendix
to
its
brief
reprints
a
letter
from
general
hershey
to
mendel
rivers,
which
makes
their
punitive
intent
abundantly
clear.
on
page
81,
general
hershey
says
that
selective
service
should
not
be
used
for
punitive
purposes,
if
by
that
it's
meant
that
one
should
be
inducted
to
the
armed
forces
as
punishment
for
an
offense,
which
is
not
related
to
selective
service,
leaving
the
regulations
to
be
applied
in
that
vast
number
of
federal
offenses
which
maybe
found
in
trusteeses
of
the
selective
service
act
and
regulations.
indeed,
the
delinquency
regulations
are
far
broader
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
limited,
non
punitive
purpose
which
the
government
would
describe
to
them.
under
the
regulations,
a
registrant
is
presumed
to
be
1-a,
unless
he
supplies
the
board
with
information
about
his
status.
and
perhaps,
properly
so
that
compels
him
to
go
in
there,
and
tell
the
local
board
what
he's
been
doing
and
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
deferment
or
exemption.
a
delinquency
system,
which
limits
the
local
board
discretion,
and
which
provided
that
a
registrant's
classification
was
to
be
frozen,
it
was
to
be
frozen
in
1-a
for
example,
and
that
no
requests
for
deferment
would
be
considered,
until
he
started
cooperating
with
the
local
board
in
supplying
information.
if
again,
placed
under
a
limited,
non
discretionary,
regulatory
scheme,
might
be
non-punitive,
but
taking
the
further
step
of
prior
to
induction
illustrates
i
think
the
punitive
purpose,
which
lies
at
the
base
of
these
regulations.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
would
not.
i
think
that
this
regulatory
scheme
finds
no
authorization,
whatever
in
the
selective
service
center.
and
that
it
ought
to
be
held
unauthorized
and
the
president
left,
if
he
wishes
to,
to
--
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
the
regulations
were
redrafted
with
the
limitation
i've
just
suggested,
perhaps
this
court
could
find
them
approved
under
the
statute
or
authorized
under
the
president's
general
rule
making
power.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
would
be
a
different
case,
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
presence
scheme
reposing
in
local
boards,
there's
absolute
discretion,
finds
no
authorization
in
the
statute.
and,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
congress
has
ever
explicitly
and
carefully
considered
it,
as
it
has
explicitly
and
carefully
considered
every
other
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
i
know
of,
which
involves
the
imposition
of
the
sanction
of
this
character.
we
turn
therefore,
to
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
hershey
directive,
upon
the
exercise
of
protective
freedoms.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
letter
mr.
justice
black,
it
appears
at
page
81
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
a
response
to
a
letter
from
--
or
to
a
request
from
mendel
rivers
for
information.
the
government
has
attempted
to
evade
the
free
speech
issue
in
this
case.
in
its
brief
and
in
oral
argument
yesterday,
by
denying
that
it
exists.
it
underscores
this
by
saying
that
the
petitioner's
turning
in
of
his
card
is
not
protected
conduct.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
it
is,
but
the
court
needn't
reach
that
issue,
in
order
to
find
the
first
amendment
fault
in
the
hershey
directive.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
board
had
before
it,
the
following
information.
first,
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney,
reprinted
at
page
42
and
43
of
the
appendix,
stating
that
the
petitioner
had
participated
in
an
antiwar,
anti-draft
demonstration
and
turn
in
this
court.
second,
the
board
had
before
it
the
indubitably
persuasive
words
of
general
hershey
counseling
it
to
use
its
broad-ranging
discretionary
powers
to
punish
behavior
which
the
five
lay
members
of
the
board
conceived
to
be
illegal.
and
finally,
there
is
the
delinquency
notice.
we
have
here
a
case
therefore,
in
which
the
directive,
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
hershey
directive,
the
local
board
memorandum
supplemented
by
this
very
vague
system
of
procedural
provisions
in
the
delinquency
regulations
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
and
here,
as
in
naacp
and
button,
as
in
freidman
and
maryland,
as
in
aptheker
against
the
secretary
of
state,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
petitioner's
conduct
could
be
reached
and
punished
under
a
more
narrowly
drawn
regulatory
and
statutory
scheme.
the
directive
being
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
the
regulations
supplementing
this
chilling
effect
by
their
vagueness
and
the
discretion
they
vest
in
local
boards,
requires
a
reversal
of
the
petitioner's
conviction.
this
reading
is
indeed
supported
by
the
only
prior
selective
service
decision
of
this
court,
which
is
in
point,
sicurella
against
united
states.
in
sicurella,
the
local
board
had
before
it,
the
illegal
recommendation
by
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim
be
not
sustained
and
the
court
held
that
given
this
--
the
presence
of
this
persuasive
though
mistaken
recommendation,
that
the
conviction
had
to
be
reversed
because
it
did
not
affirmatively
appear
in
the
selective
service
file,
that
the
board
had
disavowed
the
unlawful
and
mistaken
views
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
final
point
to
which
i
would
address
myself
in
oral
argument
today,
leaving
the
remainder
of
rather
technical
arguments
to
our
very
lengthy
brief
is
the
variance
question.
that
is
the
petitioner
was
indicted,
if
the
court
for
refusal
to
report
for
and
submit
to
induction.
in
a
part
of
our
brief
and
i
don't
propose
to
argue,
we
say
that
that
indictment
fails
to
state
in
offense,
because
it's
bad
under
rule
seven
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
but
that
aside,
concededly
the
petitioner
reported,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that.
he
then,
went
to
the
induction
center
and
when
there,
refused,
the
records
shows,
to
obey
certain
orders
by
induction
center
officials
that
he
submit
to
processing.
he
was
never
given
an
opportunity
to
refuse
to
submit
to
induction.
submitting
to
induction,
as
this
court
had
occasion,
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
for
the
court
in
billings
and
truesdale
to
consider
at
some
length
is
a
well
defined
orderly
step
in
the
process
of
selection
of
man
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
an
offense.
it
is
a
duty
of
a
registrant
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
induction
center
officials.
and
the
failure
to
perform
that
duty
can
be
prosecuted
under
section
12
(a).
we
have
here
therefore
a
case
that
is
on
all
force
with
stirone
against
united
states,
in
which
the
indictment
charged
a
conspiracy
respecting
the
importation
of
sand
into
pennsylvania
and
the
proof
at
trial
showed
a
conspiracy
involving
both
the
importation
of
sand
and
the
exportation
of
steel.
in
other
words,
the
proof
of
trial
was
quite
different
from
the
offense
with
which
the
petitioner
was
charged.
and,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
not
inconsiderable
problem,
given
the
large
number
of
these
offenses
that
are
being
prosecuted
in
the
courts,
it
devolves
upon
the
government
with
a
special
burden,
i
think
to
plead
with
accuracy
and
above
all
to
present
to
the
grand
jury
all
of
the
facts.
so
that
at
the
time
the
charge
is
laid,
there's
been
a
thorough
and
full
consideration
of
what
it
is
the
defendant
should
be
prosecuted
for.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
has
mr.
chief
justice,
refused
to
comply
with
that
part
of
the
induction
process
that
deals
with
the
physical
and
mental
examination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
it
is.
it's
an
offense
under
the
regulations
in
the
statute,
section
12
(a)
of
the
act,
makes
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
perform
any
duty
under
the
regulations.
the
regulations
make
it
a
duty
to
comply
with
those
orders
of
induction
center
officials.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
not
my
point.
my
point
is
that
if
he
committed
any
offense
at
all,
it
was
the
offense
of
refusing
to
obey
orders
that
he
take
physical
and
mental
examinations
at
the
induction
center.
and
it
was
not
the
offense
of
which
he
was
indicted,
the
refusal
to
submit
to
induction,
which
is
a
very
precisely
defined
offense
in
the
selective
service
and
army
regulations,
which
this
court
had
before
it,
in
billings
against
truesdale.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
variance
question?
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not
raised
at
the
trial.
if
the
issue
arose
during
the
trial
and
i
think
from
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
contention
that
was
focused
on
was
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
inform
the
petitioner
of
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
i
think
that
this
question
is
fairly
composed
within
that.
and
it
is
certainly
a
question
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
the
destruction
question
i
believe
is
foreclosed
by
the
court's
decision
in
o'brien
against
united
states.
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
in
which
the
surrender
of
the
card
was
a
part
of
a
constitutionally
protected
course
of
conduct
that
it
was
a
protected
first
amendment
activity.
that
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
would
say
not
mr.
chief
justice,
although
it's
a
question
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
you
asked
it.
if
the
board
would
have
send
him
another
card
and
if
his
failure
to
possess
it
is
unrelated
to
a
course
of
conduct
in
which
he's
exercising
his
first
amendment
right
of
dissent.
then,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
the
one
that
we
have
before
us.
our
point
there
is
only
that
there
is
a
difference
as
i
believe,
the
court
said
in
o'brien
between
permanently
rendering
one
certificate
unavailable
and
the
abandonment
of
it.
and
that
there
has
been
by
the
government
no
showing
that
this
conduct
by
the
petitioner
or
similar
conduct
by
others
across
the
country
is
interfered
with
the
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
thus,
we
do
not
have
a
showing
by
the
government
that
the
countervailing
interest
is
paramount,
cogent,
important,
strong
or
any
of
the
other
words,
which
the
court
has
used
in
defining
the
permissible
scope
of
limitation
of
speech
and
non-speech
conduct,
when
they're
brigaded
together.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
find
in
the
regulation
mr.
justice
stewart
no
statement
that
the
board
has
such
a
duty.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
he
can
a
duplicate
card.
the
difficulty,
it
was
another
difficulty
with
these
regulations
of
course,
is
that
if
the
board
gets
a
card,
which
the
registrant
has
lost,
it
has
no
way
of
knowing
the
reason
why
he
is
abandoned
it.
and
there's
no
provision
under
the
regulations
to
give
him
a
hearing.
indeed,
in
this
record
the
board
never
had
any
evidence
that
the
petitioner
surrendered
his
card.
selective
service
certificates
aren't
even
in
the
file.
i
don't
know
where
they
are.
the
only
evidence
the
board
had
was
the
united
states
attorney's
letter.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
there
is
no
dispute.
no,
but
i
think
it
underscores
one
of
the
dangers
in
this
regulatory
scheme
sir.
i
want
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
say
that
they
would.
and
if
the
actions
of
boards
were
limited
to
sending
the
card
back
to
the
registrant,
we
wouldn't
have
the
case
we
have.
it's
only
when
the
board
seeks
to
use
the
coming
into
its
office
of
card,
as
the
predicate
for
deprival
of
a
benefit
conferred
with
the
statute
in
regulation
that
a
quite
serious
congressional
authorization
and
due
process
problems
is
raised.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
not
make
a
difference,
unless
that
determination
were
made
after
the
kind
of
adversary
hearing,
which
this
court
has
in
other
cases
involving
imposition
of
sanctions
regardless
indispensable.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
our
position
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
for
failure
to
provide
such
a
hearing.
yes,
that
seems
reasonable
that
if
the
board
is
going
to
take
away
the
registrant
statutorily
and
regulatory
mandated
position
in
the
manpower
pool,
that
it
ought
to
have
some
means
reliable,
fair,
orderly
means
of
informing
itself.
that
is
our
position.
in
conclusion,
i
find
it
quite
difficult
to
state
my
sense
of
urgency
about
this
case.
and
mr.
ruckelshaus
perhaps
set
our
theme
for
us
yesterday
in
breen.
there
is
today
a
rising
tide
of
protest
activity.
much
of
that
activity
involves
conduct,
which
under
this
court's
decision
can
clearly
be
punished.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
war
in
vietnam
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
nor
its
conscription.
the
issue
is
whether
having
chosen
to
fight
a
war
in
vietnam
with
a
conscript
army.
we
ought
to
tolerate
in
doing
so,
departure
from
the
principle,
that
delegations
of
power
are
mistrusted
when
personal
liberty
is
at
stake.
that
no
man
should
be
condemned
before
his
heard.
and
that
however
outrageous
a
man's
political
conduct,
it
cannot
be
punished
by
invoking
a
system
of
rules
which
are
vague
and
overbroad
on
their
face.
i
think
if
we
depart
from
these
principles
than
in
these
very
difficult
times
we've
constitutional
compact
is
more
than
dishonored,
it
will
become
the
cruelest
of
illusions.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
it
is
the
government's
position
that
these
regulations
ought
to
be
limited,
the
president
has
the
power
to
limit
them
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen.
selective
service
system
is
exempt
from
the
rule
making
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
in
tomorrow
morning's
federal
register,
the
position
of
the
executive
branch
could
be
made
indisputably
clear.
but
if
that
is
not
to
be
done,
then
we
accept
the
government's
concession
that
willfulness
is
required
and
that
a
hearing
must
be
given
if
one
is
asked
for.
and
this
conviction
must
therefore
be
reversed,
because
there
is
in
this
record,
in
the
selective
service
file,
which
as
this
court
held
in
cox
against
united
states
is
the
sole
basis
of
review.
no
finding
of
willfulness
and
there
is
no
showing
that
the
petitioner
was
ever
offered
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
on
page
42
and
43
that
information,
it
consists
of
the
appendix.
it
consists
of
a
letter
from
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
to
the
deputy
state
director
of
the
selective
service
system.
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
could
not
be
relied
upon
to
establish
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
if
i
said
there
was
none,
i
misspoke
my
self.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
i
misspoke
myself,
our
position
would
be
and
it
is
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
finding
by
the
board
of
willfulness.
and
i
believe
i
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
finding,
by
the
board
of
willfulness.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
there
is
mr.
chief
justice,
a
factual
basis
there,
but
the
review
of
selective
service
decisions
is
on
the
file
made
by
the
selective
service
system
and
the
registrant.
it
brings
me
to
another
point
here,
mr.
ruckelshaus
has
said
that
the
criminal
trial
that
a
registrant
receives
is
a
substitute
for
the
due
process
hearing,
which
we
claim
he's
entitled
to
before
the
agency.
of
course
that
trial
has
the
most
constricted
standard
of
judicial
review
of
board
determinations,
particularly
factual
determinations
of
any
judicial
review,
of
any
administrative
action,
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
review.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
but
only
as
to
factual
issues,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
issue
whether
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
file
to
support
the
board's
determination
has
this
court
has
held
the
character
of
an
issue
of
law.
and
therefore,
the
government
does
not
have
the
obligation
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
with
respect
to
it.
so
that
there
is
not
that
safeguard
provided,
with
respect
to
the
facts
presented
to
the
agency.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
the
first
amendment
claims
were
raised
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes.
those
two
were
issues
of
law,
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
present,
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
he
was.
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
our
position
then
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
as
not
having
been
authorized
by
congress.
that
they're
nonetheless
invalid
for
failure
to
provide
procedural
safeguards
and
that
the
hershey
memorandum
is
an
incommunicable
system
of
regulation
or
scheme
regulation,
which
violates
the
first
amendment
on
its
face
so
that
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
the
regulations
here,
the
delinquency
regulations,
the
hershey
memorandum
and
the
local
board
memorandum
taken
together,
are
a
scheme
for
regulating
dissent,
which
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
and
that
therefore,
because
the
board
acted
in
reliance
upon
a
part
of
the
scheme,
the
conviction
must
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regulations
do
not
provide
for
a
hearing,
a
fair
reading
of
regulation
1642.14b
establishes
that
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
the
registrant
is
already
1-a,
that
the
only
hearing,
that
can
be
granted
repossess
in
the
absolute
unfettered
discussion
of
the
local
board.
second
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
my
response
to
that
would
be
twofold,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
delinquency
notice,
although
it
asked
the
registrant
to
come
in
to
a
local
board,
says
he
can
come
in
to
any
local
board.
the
regulations
provide
that
what
is
to
happen
to
him
there
is
not
telling
him
that
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing.
second,
as
this
court
held
in
mckart
against
united
states,
he
would
be
excused
from
fetter
to
exhaust
because
of
the
futility
of
doing
so,
we
will
forget
the
selective
service
board,
372
federal
2d,
817.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
serious
question,
here
in
oestereich
against
the
selective
service
board,
but
not
decided
in
that
case.
of
whether
the
selective
service
system
is
being
used
to
punish
or
sanction
this
ancient
behavior
without
due
process,
without
congressional
authorization
and
on
the
standards
so
vague
and
broad
as
to
offend
the
first
amendment.
there
is
in
addition
here,
two
serious
questions,
there
are
here
two
serious
questions,
concerning
criminal
procedure
in
the
9.7%
of
all
federal
criminal
prosecutions,
which
are
represented
by
selective
service
prosecutions
today.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
9.7%
i
believe
in
the
last
report.
the
petitioner,
david
gutknecht
anticipated
in
an
antiwar,
anti-draft
demonstration
on
the
16th
of
october,
1967,
in
the
course
of
which
he
dropped
his
registration
certificate
and
notice
of
classification,
along
with
the
mimeograph
statement
of
position
on
the
vietnam
war
and
conscription,
at
the
feet
of
the
united
states
martial,
in
front
of
the
federal
building
in
minneapolis.
eight
days
later,
on
the
24th
of
october,
1967,
general
hershey,
the
director
of
the
selective
service
system,
issued
the
letter
to
all
local
boards
and
local
board
memorandum
number
85,
which
are
reprinted
in
appendix
b
to
the
petitioner's
brief
which
was
an
issue
in
oestereich.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
at
that
time
mr.
chief
justice
he
was
classified
1-a,
although
he
had
an
appeal
pending,
which
meant
that
he
could
not
be
inducted.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
does
not.
the
average
time
is
a
meaningless
figure.
it
varies
greatly
depending
on
the
workload.
those
figures
are
collected
most
recently
in
the
marshall
commission
report
in
pursuit
of
equity.
the
local
board
memorandum
and
letter,
urged
local
boards
to
use
the
delinquency
power
to
reclassify
and
order
for
priority
induction,
registrants
who
engaged
in
illegal
demonstrations.
as
soon
as
it
could
under
the
regulations,
the
petitioner's
board
on
december
21,
1967,
sent
him
a
delinquency
notice,
reprinted
at
page
44
of
the
appendix.
and
a
weekend,
a
day
and
christmas
day
after
that,
sent
him
an
order
to
report
for
priority
induction.
taking
him
out
of
his
statutorily
and
regulatory
mandated
position
in
the
order
of
call
and
ordering
him
for
military
service,
ahead
of
the
time,
when
he
would
otherwise
have
to
report.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
if
it
had
been
pending
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
have
been
illegal.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
under
the
regulations.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
was
not
pending.
the
petitioner
concededly
reported
for
induction,
but
did
not
obey
the
orders
of
the
induction
center
officials
relating
to
his
processing.
a
prosecution
for
refusal
to
report
for
and
submit
to
induction
followed
then,
he
is
currently
under
sentence
of
four
years
imprisonment.
the
delinquency
regulations,
if
the
court
please,
provide
that
when
a
registrant
fails
to
perform
any
duty,
a
term
given
no
further
definition,
under
the
act
or
regulations,
he
may
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
board
be
declared
delinquent.
if
he
is
to
further
exempt,
he
may
again
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
board
be
classified
in
the
class
available
for
service.
if
he's
already
1-a,
he
is
sent
to
the
head
of
the
list
for
induction.
now,
if
he
is
reclassified
out
of
the
deferred
or
exempt
status,
he
has
a
personal
appearance
before
the
board
and
an
appeal.
if
like
the
petitioner,
he
is
already
1-a,
he
is
entitled
to
no
hearing
whatever
before
the
local
board
under
the
regulations.
say
that
hearing
which
the
board
in
its
absolute
discretion
may
choose
to
give
him.
the
decision
to
declare,
retain,
or
remit
delinquency
status,
resides
under
the
regulations
in
the
discretion
of
the
board.
it's
our
contention,
set
forth
in
our
brief,
that
this
kind
of
administrative
sanctioning
procedure,
involving
the
summary
deprival
of
a
benefit
or
privilege,
under
a
regulatory
system,
knows
no
parallel
in
federal
administrative
law
today.
and
when
coupled
with
administration
under
the
broad
ranging
directive
of
the
director
of
selective
service
to
have
local
boards
reach
out
to
get
at
the
sanctioned
behavior,
the
regulations
have
a
fearsome
deterrent
effect
upon
the
exercise
of
protected
freedoms.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
our
case
depends
not
at
all
upon
that
point.
we
do
of
course
contend
that
the
regulations
impose
punishment
and
therefore,
he
was
entitled
to
a
judicial
trial.
second,
that
they
impose
a
sanction
at
least
and
he
is
entitled
to
due
process
and
adversary
hearing.
but,
even
if
the
court
should
decide
those
questions
against
us,
we
believe
that
green
and
mcelroy
compels
reversal
here.
green
and
mcelroy
will
be
recalled,
did
not
require
the
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
all
the
court
held
was
that
given
our
presumption
in
favor
of
fairness,
we
would
not
presume
that
the
congress
authorized
an
administrative
agency
to
dispense
with
these
fundamental
procedural
decencies,
without
an
expressed
statement
by
the
congress
and
an
expressed
statement
by
the
president
of
an
intention
to
do
so.
and
if
the
court
were
to
adapt
that
position,
which
seems
to
me
sensible
and
supported
by
the
former
decisions
of
the
court,
the
constitutional
issue
need
not
be
reached.
however,
we
do
believe
that
if
the
constitutional
issue
must
be
reached,
should
be
decided
in
our
favor.
these
regulations
in
their
purpose,
their
language,
their
administration,
and
their
effect
are
punitive.
even
the
government
cannot
evade
this
issue
and
it's
brief
that
a
search
on
the
one
hand
that
they
are
not
punitive
and
in
the
appendix
to
its
brief
reprints
a
letter
from
general
hershey
to
mendel
rivers,
which
makes
their
punitive
intent
abundantly
clear.
on
page
81,
general
hershey
says
that
selective
service
should
not
be
used
for
punitive
purposes,
if
by
that
it's
meant
that
one
should
be
inducted
to
the
armed
forces
as
punishment
for
an
offense,
which
is
not
related
to
selective
service,
leaving
the
regulations
to
be
applied
in
that
vast
number
of
federal
offenses
which
maybe
found
in
trusteeses
of
the
selective
service
act
and
regulations.
indeed,
the
delinquency
regulations
are
far
broader
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
limited,
non
punitive
purpose
which
the
government
would
describe
to
them.
under
the
regulations,
a
registrant
is
presumed
to
be
1-a,
unless
he
supplies
the
board
with
information
about
his
status.
and
perhaps,
properly
so
that
compels
him
to
go
in
there,
and
tell
the
local
board
what
he's
been
doing
and
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
deferment
or
exemption.
a
delinquency
system,
which
limits
the
local
board
discretion,
and
which
provided
that
a
registrant's
classification
was
to
be
frozen,
it
was
to
be
frozen
in
1-a
for
example,
and
that
no
requests
for
deferment
would
be
considered,
until
he
started
cooperating
with
the
local
board
in
supplying
information.
if
again,
placed
under
a
limited,
non
discretionary,
regulatory
scheme,
might
be
non-punitive,
but
taking
the
further
step
of
prior
to
induction
illustrates
i
think
the
punitive
purpose,
which
lies
at
the
base
of
these
regulations.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
would
not.
i
think
that
this
regulatory
scheme
finds
no
authorization,
whatever
in
the
selective
service
center.
and
that
it
ought
to
be
held
unauthorized
and
the
president
left,
if
he
wishes
to,
to
--
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
the
regulations
were
redrafted
with
the
limitation
i've
just
suggested,
perhaps
this
court
could
find
them
approved
under
the
statute
or
authorized
under
the
president's
general
rule
making
power.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
would
be
a
different
case,
yes
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
presence
scheme
reposing
in
local
boards,
there's
absolute
discretion,
finds
no
authorization
in
the
statute.
and,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
congress
has
ever
explicitly
and
carefully
considered
it,
as
it
has
explicitly
and
carefully
considered
every
other
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
i
know
of,
which
involves
the
imposition
of
the
sanction
of
this
character.
we
turn
therefore,
to
the
inhibitory
effect
of
the
hershey
directive,
upon
the
exercise
of
protective
freedoms.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
letter
mr.
justice
black,
it
appears
at
page
81
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
a
response
to
a
letter
from
--
or
to
a
request
from
mendel
rivers
for
information.
the
government
has
attempted
to
evade
the
free
speech
issue
in
this
case.
in
its
brief
and
in
oral
argument
yesterday,
by
denying
that
it
exists.
it
underscores
this
by
saying
that
the
petitioner's
turning
in
of
his
card
is
not
protected
conduct.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
it
is,
but
the
court
needn't
reach
that
issue,
in
order
to
find
the
first
amendment
fault
in
the
hershey
directive.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
board
had
before
it,
the
following
information.
first,
a
letter
from
the
united
states
attorney,
reprinted
at
page
42
and
43
of
the
appendix,
stating
that
the
petitioner
had
participated
in
an
antiwar,
anti-draft
demonstration
and
turn
in
this
court.
second,
the
board
had
before
it
the
indubitably
persuasive
words
of
general
hershey
counseling
it
to
use
its
broad-ranging
discretionary
powers
to
punish
behavior
which
the
five
lay
members
of
the
board
conceived
to
be
illegal.
and
finally,
there
is
the
delinquency
notice.
we
have
here
a
case
therefore,
in
which
the
directive,
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
hershey
directive,
the
local
board
memorandum
supplemented
by
this
very
vague
system
of
procedural
provisions
in
the
delinquency
regulations
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
and
here,
as
in
naacp
and
button,
as
in
freidman
and
maryland,
as
in
aptheker
against
the
secretary
of
state,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
petitioner's
conduct
could
be
reached
and
punished
under
a
more
narrowly
drawn
regulatory
and
statutory
scheme.
the
directive
being
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
the
regulations
supplementing
this
chilling
effect
by
their
vagueness
and
the
discretion
they
vest
in
local
boards,
requires
a
reversal
of
the
petitioner's
conviction.
this
reading
is
indeed
supported
by
the
only
prior
selective
service
decision
of
this
court,
which
is
in
point,
sicurella
against
united
states.
in
sicurella,
the
local
board
had
before
it,
the
illegal
recommendation
by
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
petitioner's
conscientious
objector
claim
be
not
sustained
and
the
court
held
that
given
this
--
the
presence
of
this
persuasive
though
mistaken
recommendation,
that
the
conviction
had
to
be
reversed
because
it
did
not
affirmatively
appear
in
the
selective
service
file,
that
the
board
had
disavowed
the
unlawful
and
mistaken
views
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
final
point
to
which
i
would
address
myself
in
oral
argument
today,
leaving
the
remainder
of
rather
technical
arguments
to
our
very
lengthy
brief
is
the
variance
question.
that
is
the
petitioner
was
indicted,
if
the
court
for
refusal
to
report
for
and
submit
to
induction.
in
a
part
of
our
brief
and
i
don't
propose
to
argue,
we
say
that
that
indictment
fails
to
state
in
offense,
because
it's
bad
under
rule
seven
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
but
that
aside,
concededly
the
petitioner
reported,
the
government
doesn't
deny
that.
he
then,
went
to
the
induction
center
and
when
there,
refused,
the
records
shows,
to
obey
certain
orders
by
induction
center
officials
that
he
submit
to
processing.
he
was
never
given
an
opportunity
to
refuse
to
submit
to
induction.
submitting
to
induction,
as
this
court
had
occasion,
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
for
the
court
in
billings
and
truesdale
to
consider
at
some
length
is
a
well
defined
orderly
step
in
the
process
of
selection
of
man
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
an
offense.
it
is
a
duty
of
a
registrant
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
induction
center
officials.
and
the
failure
to
perform
that
duty
can
be
prosecuted
under
section
12
(a).
we
have
here
therefore
a
case
that
is
on
all
force
with
stirone
against
united
states,
in
which
the
indictment
charged
a
conspiracy
respecting
the
importation
of
sand
into
pennsylvania
and
the
proof
at
trial
showed
a
conspiracy
involving
both
the
importation
of
sand
and
the
exportation
of
steel.
in
other
words,
the
proof
of
trial
was
quite
different
from
the
offense
with
which
the
petitioner
was
charged.
and,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
not
inconsiderable
problem,
given
the
large
number
of
these
offenses
that
are
being
prosecuted
in
the
courts,
it
devolves
upon
the
government
with
a
special
burden,
i
think
to
plead
with
accuracy
and
above
all
to
present
to
the
grand
jury
all
of
the
facts.
so
that
at
the
time
the
charge
is
laid,
there's
been
a
thorough
and
full
consideration
of
what
it
is
the
defendant
should
be
prosecuted
for.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
he
has
mr.
chief
justice,
refused
to
comply
with
that
part
of
the
induction
process
that
deals
with
the
physical
and
mental
examination.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
it
is.
it's
an
offense
under
the
regulations
in
the
statute,
section
12
(a)
of
the
act,
makes
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
perform
any
duty
under
the
regulations.
the
regulations
make
it
a
duty
to
comply
with
those
orders
of
induction
center
officials.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
not
my
point.
my
point
is
that
if
he
committed
any
offense
at
all,
it
was
the
offense
of
refusing
to
obey
orders
that
he
take
physical
and
mental
examinations
at
the
induction
center.
and
it
was
not
the
offense
of
which
he
was
indicted,
the
refusal
to
submit
to
induction,
which
is
a
very
precisely
defined
offense
in
the
selective
service
and
army
regulations,
which
this
court
had
before
it,
in
billings
against
truesdale.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
variance
question?
no,
mr.
chief
justice
it
was
not
raised
at
the
trial.
if
the
issue
arose
during
the
trial
and
i
think
from
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
contention
that
was
focused
on
was
the
failure
of
the
indictment
to
inform
the
petitioner
of
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
i
think
that
this
question
is
fairly
composed
within
that.
and
it
is
certainly
a
question
upon
which
certiorari
was
granted.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
the
destruction
question
i
believe
is
foreclosed
by
the
court's
decision
in
o'brien
against
united
states.
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
in
which
the
surrender
of
the
card
was
a
part
of
a
constitutionally
protected
course
of
conduct
that
it
was
a
protected
first
amendment
activity.
that
is
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
would
say
not
mr.
chief
justice,
although
it's
a
question
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
you
asked
it.
if
the
board
would
have
send
him
another
card
and
if
his
failure
to
possess
it
is
unrelated
to
a
course
of
conduct
in
which
he's
exercising
his
first
amendment
right
of
dissent.
then,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
the
one
that
we
have
before
us.
our
point
there
is
only
that
there
is
a
difference
as
i
believe,
the
court
said
in
o'brien
between
permanently
rendering
one
certificate
unavailable
and
the
abandonment
of
it.
and
that
there
has
been
by
the
government
no
showing
that
this
conduct
by
the
petitioner
or
similar
conduct
by
others
across
the
country
is
interfered
with
the
operation
of
the
selective
service
system.
thus,
we
do
not
have
a
showing
by
the
government
that
the
countervailing
interest
is
paramount,
cogent,
important,
strong
or
any
of
the
other
words,
which
the
court
has
used
in
defining
the
permissible
scope
of
limitation
of
speech
and
non-speech
conduct,
when
they're
brigaded
together.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
find
in
the
regulation
mr.
justice
stewart
no
statement
that
the
board
has
such
a
duty.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
he
can
a
duplicate
card.
the
difficulty,
it
was
another
difficulty
with
these
regulations
of
course,
is
that
if
the
board
gets
a
card,
which
the
registrant
has
lost,
it
has
no
way
of
knowing
the
reason
why
he
is
abandoned
it.
and
there's
no
provision
under
the
regulations
to
give
him
a
hearing.
indeed,
in
this
record
the
board
never
had
any
evidence
that
the
petitioner
surrendered
his
card.
selective
service
certificates
aren't
even
in
the
file.
i
don't
know
where
they
are.
the
only
evidence
the
board
had
was
the
united
states
attorney's
letter.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
there
is
no
dispute.
no,
but
i
think
it
underscores
one
of
the
dangers
in
this
regulatory
scheme
sir.
i
want
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
say
that
they
would.
and
if
the
actions
of
boards
were
limited
to
sending
the
card
back
to
the
registrant,
we
wouldn't
have
the
case
we
have.
it's
only
when
the
board
seeks
to
use
the
coming
into
its
office
of
card,
as
the
predicate
for
deprival
of
a
benefit
conferred
with
the
statute
in
regulation
that
a
quite
serious
congressional
authorization
and
due
process
problems
is
raised.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
not
make
a
difference,
unless
that
determination
were
made
after
the
kind
of
adversary
hearing,
which
this
court
has
in
other
cases
involving
imposition
of
sanctions
regardless
indispensable.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
our
position
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
for
failure
to
provide
such
a
hearing.
yes,
that
seems
reasonable
that
if
the
board
is
going
to
take
away
the
registrant
statutorily
and
regulatory
mandated
position
in
the
manpower
pool,
that
it
ought
to
have
some
means
reliable,
fair,
orderly
means
of
informing
itself.
that
is
our
position.
in
conclusion,
i
find
it
quite
difficult
to
state
my
sense
of
urgency
about
this
case.
and
mr.
ruckelshaus
perhaps
set
our
theme
for
us
yesterday
in
breen.
there
is
today
a
rising
tide
of
protest
activity.
much
of
that
activity
involves
conduct,
which
under
this
court's
decision
can
clearly
be
punished.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
war
in
vietnam
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
nor
its
conscription.
the
issue
is
whether
having
chosen
to
fight
a
war
in
vietnam
with
a
conscript
army.
we
ought
to
tolerate
in
doing
so,
departure
from
the
principle,
that
delegations
of
power
are
mistrusted
when
personal
liberty
is
at
stake.
that
no
man
should
be
condemned
before
his
heard.
and
that
however
outrageous
a
man's
political
conduct,
it
cannot
be
punished
by
invoking
a
system
of
rules
which
are
vague
and
overbroad
on
their
face.
i
think
if
we
depart
from
these
principles
than
in
these
very
difficult
times
we've
constitutional
compact
is
more
than
dishonored,
it
will
become
the
cruelest
of
illusions.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
it
is
the
government's
position
that
these
regulations
ought
to
be
limited,
the
president
has
the
power
to
limit
them
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen.
selective
service
system
is
exempt
from
the
rule
making
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
in
tomorrow
morning's
federal
register,
the
position
of
the
executive
branch
could
be
made
indisputably
clear.
but
if
that
is
not
to
be
done,
then
we
accept
the
government's
concession
that
willfulness
is
required
and
that
a
hearing
must
be
given
if
one
is
asked
for.
and
this
conviction
must
therefore
be
reversed,
because
there
is
in
this
record,
in
the
selective
service
file,
which
as
this
court
held
in
cox
against
united
states
is
the
sole
basis
of
review.
no
finding
of
willfulness
and
there
is
no
showing
that
the
petitioner
was
ever
offered
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
on
page
42
and
43
that
information,
it
consists
of
the
appendix.
it
consists
of
a
letter
from
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
to
the
deputy
state
director
of
the
selective
service
system.
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
could
not
be
relied
upon
to
establish
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
if
i
said
there
was
none,
i
misspoke
my
self.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
i
misspoke
myself,
our
position
would
be
and
it
is
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
finding
by
the
board
of
willfulness.
and
i
believe
i
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
finding,
by
the
board
of
willfulness.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
there
is
mr.
chief
justice,
a
factual
basis
there,
but
the
review
of
selective
service
decisions
is
on
the
file
made
by
the
selective
service
system
and
the
registrant.
it
brings
me
to
another
point
here,
mr.
ruckelshaus
has
said
that
the
criminal
trial
that
a
registrant
receives
is
a
substitute
for
the
due
process
hearing,
which
we
claim
he's
entitled
to
before
the
agency.
of
course
that
trial
has
the
most
constricted
standard
of
judicial
review
of
board
determinations,
particularly
factual
determinations
of
any
judicial
review,
of
any
administrative
action,
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
review.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
but
only
as
to
factual
issues,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
issue
whether
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
file
to
support
the
board's
determination
has
this
court
has
held
the
character
of
an
issue
of
law.
and
therefore,
the
government
does
not
have
the
obligation
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
with
respect
to
it.
so
that
there
is
not
that
safeguard
provided,
with
respect
to
the
facts
presented
to
the
agency.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
the
first
amendment
claims
were
raised
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes.
those
two
were
issues
of
law,
which
he
would
be
entitled
to
present,
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
he
was.
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
our
position
then
mr.
justice
black
is
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
as
not
having
been
authorized
by
congress.
that
they're
nonetheless
invalid
for
failure
to
provide
procedural
safeguards
and
that
the
hershey
memorandum
is
an
incommunicable
system
of
regulation
or
scheme
regulation,
which
violates
the
first
amendment
on
its
face
so
that
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
the
regulations
here,
the
delinquency
regulations,
the
hershey
memorandum
and
the
local
board
memorandum
taken
together,
are
a
scheme
for
regulating
dissent,
which
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face.
and
that
therefore,
because
the
board
acted
in
reliance
upon
a
part
of
the
scheme,
the
conviction
must
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
the
regulations
do
not
provide
for
a
hearing,
a
fair
reading
of
regulation
1642.14b
establishes
that
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
the
registrant
is
already
1-a,
that
the
only
hearing,
that
can
be
granted
repossess
in
the
absolute
unfettered
discussion
of
the
local
board.
second
--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
my
response
to
that
would
be
twofold,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
delinquency
notice,
although
it
asked
the
registrant
to
come
in
to
a
local
board,
says
he
can
come
in
to
any
local
board.
the
regulations
provide
that
what
is
to
happen
to
him
there
is
not
telling
him
that
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing.
second,
as
this
court
held
in
mckart
against
united
states,
he
would
be
excused
from
fetter
to
exhaust
because
of
the
futility
of
doing
so,
we
will
forget
the
selective
service
board,
372
federal
2d,
817.
