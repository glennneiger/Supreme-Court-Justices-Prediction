mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
again
today
we
find
ourselves
at
the
outset
faced
with
the
same
problem
that
we
faced
at
the
outset
of
the
green
case.
and
that
is
that
throughout
both
green
and
gutknecht,
throughout
the
briefs
file
by
the
petitioners
in
both
cases
and
throughout
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
both
cases,
there
is
this
overtone
or
undertone
of
accusation
against
the
selective
service
system
focused
in
on
the
hershey
directive,
somehow
implying
that
the
reason
people
are
being
declared
registrants
are
being
declared
delinquent
in
this
country
today
is
because
of
their
protest
activities.
now,
i
don't
happen
to
believe
that
that
is
true.
however,
even
if
it
is
true,
it
has
not
been
proven
in
either
one
of
these
cases.
let
me
give
just
one
fact
that
was
omitted.
on
december
20th
mr.
gutknecht
was
declared
delinquent.
the
hershey
directive
was
issued
in
october.
on
december
9th
at
page
41
of
our
brief
is
reprinted
in
breen.
the
brief
in
breen
has
printed
the
joint
statement
of
then
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
and
general
hershey,
specifically,
repudiate
the
idea
that
any
registrant
could
be
inducted
or
his
induction
could
be
accelerated,
because
of
his
belief,
because
of
any
protest
activity
unrelated
to
any
violation
of
a
delinquency
regulation
that
he
engaged
in.
in
the
court
below
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
on
page
41
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
not
in
this
brief.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
now,
this
as
the
boards
in
the
selective
service
system
had
this
directive
or
had
this
joint
memorandum
of
general
hershey
and
then
attorney
general
clark
before
them
after
they
had
the
hershey
directive
before
them.
in
the
court
below,
on
page
35
of
the
appendix,
the
court
states,
defendant
now
claim
that
he
was
being
unlawfully
punished
for
his
political
views
on
the
vietnam
war
and
states
that
the
board's
punitive
action
was
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
this
is
the
appellate
court
speech.
the
district
court
however
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
at
trial
to
support
defendant's
contention
that
his
delinquency
order
was
based
upon
his
political
views.
the
district
court
found
that
the
delinquency
order
was
based
upon
the
defendant's
violation
of
the
regulation
that
he
had
the
required
cards
in
his
possession
at
all
time,
that's
what
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
certainly
part
of
this
case,
but
what
i
am
attempting
to
do
at
the
outset
is
define
narrowly
just
what
it
is
involved
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
they
have
launched
in
their
brief
a
rather
massive
attack
on
the
delinquency
regulations
themselves
saying
that
they
were
not
authorized
by
statute
that
even
if
they
were
authorized,
the
statute
is
so
vague,
it's
to
be
devoid
of
standards,
then
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
in
oestereich
suggested
that
sound
arguments
could
be
made
along
the
lines
that
petitioner
here
makes
them.
i
think
that
if
there
is
any
disagreement,
it
would
be
that
i
would
delete
the
word
“sound.”
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
along
the
lines
the
petitioner
has
made
them.
but
i
don't
believe
that
they're
sound
and
i
think
that
in
our
brief
we
relate
while
we
believe
they're
not.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
court
below
decided
this
question
on
rather
narrow
grounds.
on
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations
in
acceleration
within
a
class,
within
the
class
in
this
case
1-a.
i
think
that
question
is
covered
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
the
overall
question
of
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations,
as
far
as
reclassification
is
concerned,
is
what
--
is
either
going
to
be
before
this
court.
in
this
case,
if
they
decide
not
to
take
it
on
the
narrow
grounds
or
will
be
in
some
other
cases
that
are
pending
here
on
petition
for
certiorari.
and
for
that
reason
i
think
this
argument
can
best
be
had
in
terms
of
a
broader
questions.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
it
were
burned
without
his
consent
or
without
his
knowledge.
i
think
clearly
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
this
happened,
and
it
came
to
the
board's
attention,
and
they
sent
him
a
notice.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
is
possible
that
a
board
could
do
so,
but
i
think
if
they
did
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
be
a
clear
abuse
of
their
discretion.
and
if
this
happened
we
would
--
and
if
this
is
what
had
happened
in
this
case,
we
would
not
be
here
in
this
court
today.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
we
would
have
confessed
there
prior
to
coming
here.
now,
i
think
if
under
our
interpretation
of
the
regulations,
if
a
regulation
is
violated
by
inadvertence
or
by
mistake
of
the
registrant
and
the
board
attempts
to
accelerate
him
under
a
strict
reading
of
the
regulations
that
this
is
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
board.
that
it
is
only
willful
violations
on
the
part
of
registrants
and
not
only
willful,
but
a
violation
in
which
the
registrant
shows
no
desire
to
come
back
in
to
compliance
again
with
the
regulations.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
was
not
offered
a
new
draft
card,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
but
on
page
44
of
the
appendix
is
a
copy
of
the
delinquency
notice
that
was
sent
to
mr.
gutknecht
in
this
case.
and
in
that
delinquency
notice,
in
paragraph
two
it
said,
“you
are
hereby
directed
to
report
to
the
local
board
immediately
in
person
or
by
mail
or
to
take
this
notice
to
the
local
board
nearest
to
you
for
advice
as
to
what
you
should
do.”
now,
mr.
gutknecht
did
not
do
that,
he
said
that
because
five
days
later,
he
was
reclassified
that
this
in
effect
did
not
give
him
the
amount
of
notice
that
he
needed
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance.
if
he
had
tried
to
get
himself
back
into
compliance
by
showing
a
willingness
to
possess
his
cards
at
anytime,
prior
to
induction
or
certainly
prior
to
the
notice
of
induction,
i
think
that
again
clearly
the
board
would
have
been
abusing
its
discretion
by
not
permitting
him
to
come
back
into
compliance.
this
is
consistent
with
our
theory
of
the
delinquency
regulations
not
being
punishment,
but
being
remedial
in
their
effect.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
respectfully
would
state
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
the
board
has
given
discretion
without
question
under
the
regulation,
but
i
think
like
any
discretionary
grant,
there
is
--
there
are
times
when
that
can
be
abused.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
consistent
with
the
analysis
of
civil
contempt
in
this
case
that
where
someone
attempts
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
for
the
regulations.
there's
a
clear
abuse
and
in
this
court
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
breen
he
could
bring
himself
back
into
compliance,
by
simply
agreeing
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
he
was
not
--
in
breen,
he
has
never
been
given
an
induction.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
has
never
been
given
--
yes,
he
has
never
been
given
a
notice
of
induction.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he's
doing
it
in
a
criminal
action,
which
were
here
before
this
court,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
under
the
regulation,
under
the
law,
under
section
10
(b)
3
this
is
the
vehicle
which
he
can
use
to
test
his
rights.
and
that's
precisely
what
he's
doing
here
in
this
court
and
as
a
further
example
of
what
i'm
saying
in
number
623,
before
this
court.
now,
troutman
against
united
states,
a
confession
of
error,
a
virtual
confession
of
error
will
be
filled
by
the
justice
department,
by
the
solicitor
general,
but
tomorrow
where
mr.
troutman
attempted
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
attempting
to
focus
what
mr.
gutknecht
could
have
done
in
order
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
and
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
if
the
draft
boards,
if
the
boards
themselves
do
not
permit
him
to
come
back
into
compliance,
we're
prepared
to
confess
error,
we're
prepared
to
admit
that
they
have
abused
their
discretion.
and
i
think
in
the
grant,
in
the
regulations
themselves,
where
it
says
he
may
--
the
board
itself
may
change
its
mind
at
anytime.
and
another
regulation
writ
says
it
may
reopen
the
whole
proceedings
as
to
his
classification
at
anytime.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
look
at
a
discretionary
grant
assuming
that
is
going
to
be
abused.
obviously,
with
over
four
thousand
draft
boards
in
this
country,
there
are
abuses.
i
would
not
stand
here
and
say
they
weren't,
but
where
abuses
are
found,
where
abuses
of
that
discretionary
grant
to
the
board
are
found,
there
is
a
process
by
which
those
abuses
can
be
set
right
and
i
think
just
as
any
administrative
board
is
given
a
discretion,
where
that
discretion
is
abused,
the
person
who
is
wrong
has
a
power
and
a
right
to
raise
that
wrong
in
the
court
of
law.
and
if
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
those
who
are
meant
to
enforce
the
law,
then
this
is
the
way
it
works
in
any
case,
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
the
last
one
to
admit
the
abuse
of
discretion
or
the
solicitor
general
in
this
court.
i
don't
see
that
that's
any
difference,
in
terms
of
a
grant
of
discretion
to
the
draft
boards
and
it
is
to
any
other
administrative
agency.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that's
only
thing
that
cures
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
could
cure?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
he
has
the
right
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
it.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
our
position.
this
is
our
position
that
this
is
clearly
what
is
intended
by
the
regulations
themselves,
when
they
say
that
the
classification
maybe
reopened
at
anytime,
without
regard
to
other
regulations.
that
he
has
the
right,
when
he's
reclassified
to
notice
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
he
has
the
right
to
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board.
that
the
--
that
these
regulations
read
as
a
whole
clearly
draw
the
analogy
between
civil
contempt
that
we
have
drawn
and
make
then
remedial.
the
question
of
punishment
that
mr.
justice
marshall
addressed
himself
to
yesterday,
i
think
is
very
much
involved
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
delinquency
regulations
themselves
amount
to
punishment,
the
acceleration
and
that
if
it
does
amount
to
punishment,
is
it
done
so
without
due
process
or
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
guarantee.
now,
yesterday
when
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
about
what
the
punishment
--
the
question
that
bothered
you
that
there
maybe
elements
of
punishment
in
the
delinquency
regulations.
the
counsel
jumped
with
glee
in
his
rebuttal
argument
that
i
was
willing
to
admit
there
maybe
elements
of
punishment.
i
think
that
really
it
would
do
this
court
a
little
good
to
get
into
so
many
called
argument
of
just
exactly
what
amounts
to
punishment.
it
is
our
position
on
page
39
and
following
of
our
brief
that
some
of
the
indicia
of
legal
punishment
are
present
here,
just
as
they
were
--
the
outlined
in
the
kennedy
mendoza
case.
among
those
indicia
that
are
outline
of
that
case
is
their
sanctions
that
are
here,
ultimately
involved
an
affirmative
disability.he
is
going
to
be
restrained,
if
he's
in
the
army.
secondly,
it
comes
in
to
play
on
finding
of
scienter,
this
is
in
line
with
our
theory
that
there
has
to
be
a
willful
violation
of
the
regulations
and
a
willful
refusal
to
come
back
into
compliance
for
the
regulations,
before
the
board
has
properly
exercised
this
discretion
in
declaring
some
one
delinquent.
thirdly,
the
behavior
to
which
it
applies
is
already
a
crime
and
this
is
true
in
this
case.
it
is
already
a
crime
of
the
violation
to
the
regulations.
does
it
promote
one
of
the
traditional
aims
of
punishment,
in
deterrence
and
retribution,
which
were
named
in
the
kennedy-mendoza
case.
now,
i
think
that
while
there
are
some
questions
about
the
deterrence
as
being
only
used
and
only
defined
in
terms
of
punishment
that
there
are
deterrent
aspects
of
this.
but,
there
are
indicia
that
do
not
point
to
punishment,
as
outlined
in
the
kennedy-mendoza.
induction
is
not
historically
been
regarded
as
punishment.
secondly,
whether
there's
an
alternative
purpose
maybe
assigned,
a
non
penal
purpose
assigned
into
the
regulations
involved.
and
i
think
delinquency
regulations
do
have
an
alternative
purpose.
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
is
essentially
two
fold,
is
to
induce
cooperation
with
the
selective
service
system
on
the
part
of
all
draft
eligible
men
and
this
is
where
the
civil
contempt
analogy
comes
in.
because
if
we're
trying
to
define
this
in
a
remedial
sense,
that
we're
trying
to
get
cooperation
here,
just
as
in
a
civil
contempt
proceeding
if
somebody
comes
back
into
compliance.
and
if
he
does
what
the
regulations
say,
then
he
will
be
put
back
into
his
prior
classification,
otherwise
there
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
is
to
cure
what
has
happened
and
not
to
punish
what
has
happened
and
just
as
in
the
troutman
case,
we
have
confessed
there
and
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
do
so
in
any
instance
in
this
court
or
in
any
court,
where
it
was
shown
that
an
effort
was
made
to
cure
the
error.
the
second
purpose
--
which
is
a
non
penal
purpose,
is
the
maintenance
of
the
non
delinquent
morale.
those
who
do
comply
with
the
regulations,
it
should
not,
it
seems
to
me
be
discouraged
by
the
success
of
those
who
do
not.
and
for
this
reason,
i
think
there
is
a
good
purpose
of
the
--
alternative
purpose
of
the
statute.
but
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
i
think
to
get
into
an
argument
in
this
court
about
whether
this
amounted
to
legal
punishment
might
really
cause
the
court
to
miss
the
point.
because
the
point
in
this
case
is
why
are
we
talking
about
punishment?
we're
talking
about
punishment,
in
terms
of
the
delinquency
regulations
to
find
whether
he
has
been
deprived
of
due
process
or
is
stiff
in
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
what
is
in
this
case
the
punishment
of
which
mr.
gutknecht
the
petitioner
complains.
it
is
accelerated
induction.
this
is
what
he
complaints
of
and
before
he
can
be
inducted
in
an
accelerated
manner,
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
induction,
just
as
he
did
here.
and
thereby,
submit
himself
to
a
criminal
prosecution
in
which
he
has
the
full
panoply
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
and,
i
think
this
is
a
clear
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
case
in
mendoza-martinez,
where
the
court
went
in
to
the
admittedly
difficult
question
of
what
amounts
to
punishment
and
what
doesn't.
because
mr.
mendoza
was
never
given
a
hearing,
he
was
denationalized.
he
left
the
country,
in
order
to
avoid
the
grant
and
having
left,
he
was
immediately
denationalized.
he
had
no
right
to
a
hearing,
to
contest
their
denationalization.
there
was
no
way
he
could
bring
up
a
contesting
of
his
rights
and
the
court
there
said
that
that
was
punishment
and
without
the
due
process
or
fourth
or
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
which
he
should
have.
i
think
we
can
draw
an
analogy
between
what
has
happened
here
and
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
now,
when
a
man
is
indicted
under
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
is
in
a
very
real
sense
punished.
he
maybe
put
in
jail
if
he
is
indicted
and
without
bail,
if
it's
a
non-bailable
offense
or
bail
maybe
set
so
high
that
he
can't
meet
it,
and
he
stayed
there.
he
has
had
none
of
his
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
rights
and
probably
a
little
due
process
at
that
time.
but
in
this
case,
where
the
board
itself
has
found
him
delinquent,
because
he's
violated
one
of
the
regulations,
i
say
the
analogy
between
this
and
the
grand
jury
is
very
close.
and
secondly,
as
far
as
the
board
hearing
itself
is
concerned,
he
is
given
notice
of
the
delinquency
itself.
the
notice
that
i
read,
they're
right
on
page
44
of
the
appendix,
where
it
says,
“come
in,
until
let
us
tell
you
how
we
can
show
you
how
to
avoid
a
further
delinquency.”
in
this
case,
he
would
have
in
my
estimation,
although
it
is
contested
by
the
petitioners,
if
he
had
asked
for
a
hearing,
he
would
have
been
given
one.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
asked
for
a
hearing
in
this
case,
because
what
was
there
to
hear?
he
had
turned
in
his
draft
card.
they're
not
going
to
hear
whether
he
is
willing
to
take
them
back
or
not,
there
is
no
fact
situation
for
the
board
to
hear.
there
is
a
clear
regulation,
which
mr.
gutknecht
violated
and
under
that
regulation,
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
board
to
apply
the
delinquency
regulations,
which
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
again
under
our
theory,
he
would
have
the
right
to
purge
himself
from
this
violation
because
i
think
had
he
shown
a
desire
to
do
so
and
the
board
had
refused
to
let
him
do
it,
we
would
have
been
the
first
to
confess
error,
but
he
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
and
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
fact
situation,
which
would
have
--
this
court
could
focus
on,
to
say
whether
the
procedural
due
process
in
the
hearing
at
the
board
level
has
been
violated.
now,
i
submit
that
the
kennedy-mendoza
analysis
is
simply
not
sufficient
in
this
case
to
determine
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
legal
punishment.
i
think
there
are
some
differences,
but
even
if
you
find
that
the
line
between
punishment
and
non
punishment.
if
you
find
this
false
slightly
over
the
line
toward
punishment.
i
think
that
even
if
that
is
true,
he
has
been
given
at
one
stage,
at
the
end
of
this
process,
all
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
he
has
been
given
a
complete
due
process.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
the
statutory
framework
that
the
congress
has
setup
whereby
this
man
could
raise
his
rights
and
there
is
no
such
statutory
framework
in
the
kennedy-mendoza
situation.
now,
the
other
argument
of
the
petitioner
was
in
their
brief
that
even
if
it
wasn't
punishment,
we
have
not
provided
the
procedural
due
process
that
is
necessary
and
i
think
in
pointing
out
that
he
did
receive
notice,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
regulations
would
be
that
he
could
receive
a
hearing,
if
he
so
requested.
now,
this
is
a
completely
speculative
question
before
this
court,
because
he
didn't
request
to
hear
it.
either
before
he
received
the
delinquency
notice
or
after
he
received
his
reclassification.
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
heard
to
complain
here,
when
he
has
not
asked
for
a
hearing.
as
far
as
the
variance
between
the
charge
and
the
proof
is
concerned,
i
think
that
that
is
fairly
stated
in
the
brief
and
that
i
think
that
question,
plus
the
argument
that
the
affidavit
itself,
where
indictment
itself
was
duplicitous,
boarders
on
the
frivolous.
now,
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
clearly
point
out
that
the
questions
involved.
yesterday,
we
discussed
the
problem
of
congressional
authorization.
and
i
think
that
in
the
broad
sense,
that
the
delinquency
regulations
are
a
fair
grant
to
the
administrative
branch
by
congress
of
an
effort
to
implement
what
is
admittedly
a
difficult
statute.
to
implement
a
selective
service
law
in
a
time
in
this
country
in
which
many
people
are
opposed
to
the
results
that
might
occur
from
going
into
the
army.
but
i
think
that
given
the
policy
as
set
down
by
the
congress
in
the
executive
branch,
that
this
is
a
fair
way
of
implementing
that
policy.
and
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
below
and
uphold
the
delinquency
regulations
as
adapted
by
the
president.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
again
today
we
find
ourselves
at
the
outset
faced
with
the
same
problem
that
we
faced
at
the
outset
of
the
green
case.
and
that
is
that
throughout
both
green
and
gutknecht,
throughout
the
briefs
file
by
the
petitioners
in
both
cases
and
throughout
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
both
cases,
there
is
this
overtone
or
undertone
of
accusation
against
the
selective
service
system
focused
in
on
the
hershey
directive,
somehow
implying
that
the
reason
people
are
being
declared
registrants
are
being
declared
delinquent
in
this
country
today
is
because
of
their
protest
activities.
now,
i
don't
happen
to
believe
that
that
is
true.
however,
even
if
it
is
true,
it
has
not
been
proven
in
either
one
of
these
cases.
let
me
give
just
one
fact
that
was
omitted.
on
december
20th
mr.
gutknecht
was
declared
delinquent.
the
hershey
directive
was
issued
in
october.
on
december
9th
at
page
41
of
our
brief
is
reprinted
in
breen.
the
brief
in
breen
has
printed
the
joint
statement
of
then
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
and
general
hershey,
specifically,
repudiate
the
idea
that
any
registrant
could
be
inducted
or
his
induction
could
be
accelerated,
because
of
his
belief,
because
of
any
protest
activity
unrelated
to
any
violation
of
a
delinquency
regulation
that
he
engaged
in.
in
the
court
below
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
on
page
41
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart
not
in
this
brief.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
now,
this
as
the
boards
in
the
selective
service
system
had
this
directive
or
had
this
joint
memorandum
of
general
hershey
and
then
attorney
general
clark
before
them
after
they
had
the
hershey
directive
before
them.
in
the
court
below,
on
page
35
of
the
appendix,
the
court
states,
defendant
now
claim
that
he
was
being
unlawfully
punished
for
his
political
views
on
the
vietnam
war
and
states
that
the
board's
punitive
action
was
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
this
is
the
appellate
court
speech.
the
district
court
however
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
at
trial
to
support
defendant's
contention
that
his
delinquency
order
was
based
upon
his
political
views.
the
district
court
found
that
the
delinquency
order
was
based
upon
the
defendant's
violation
of
the
regulation
that
he
had
the
required
cards
in
his
possession
at
all
time,
that's
what
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
certainly
part
of
this
case,
but
what
i
am
attempting
to
do
at
the
outset
is
define
narrowly
just
what
it
is
involved
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
douglas,
they
have
launched
in
their
brief
a
rather
massive
attack
on
the
delinquency
regulations
themselves
saying
that
they
were
not
authorized
by
statute
that
even
if
they
were
authorized,
the
statute
is
so
vague,
it's
to
be
devoid
of
standards,
then
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
in
oestereich
suggested
that
sound
arguments
could
be
made
along
the
lines
that
petitioner
here
makes
them.
i
think
that
if
there
is
any
disagreement,
it
would
be
that
i
would
delete
the
word
“sound.”
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
along
the
lines
the
petitioner
has
made
them.
but
i
don't
believe
that
they're
sound
and
i
think
that
in
our
brief
we
relate
while
we
believe
they're
not.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
court
below
decided
this
question
on
rather
narrow
grounds.
on
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations
in
acceleration
within
a
class,
within
the
class
in
this
case
1-a.
i
think
that
question
is
covered
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
the
overall
question
of
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations,
as
far
as
reclassification
is
concerned,
is
what
--
is
either
going
to
be
before
this
court.
in
this
case,
if
they
decide
not
to
take
it
on
the
narrow
grounds
or
will
be
in
some
other
cases
that
are
pending
here
on
petition
for
certiorari.
and
for
that
reason
i
think
this
argument
can
best
be
had
in
terms
of
a
broader
questions.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
it
were
burned
without
his
consent
or
without
his
knowledge.
i
think
clearly
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
this
happened,
and
it
came
to
the
board's
attention,
and
they
sent
him
a
notice.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
is
possible
that
a
board
could
do
so,
but
i
think
if
they
did
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
would
be
a
clear
abuse
of
their
discretion.
and
if
this
happened
we
would
--
and
if
this
is
what
had
happened
in
this
case,
we
would
not
be
here
in
this
court
today.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
we
would
have
confessed
there
prior
to
coming
here.
now,
i
think
if
under
our
interpretation
of
the
regulations,
if
a
regulation
is
violated
by
inadvertence
or
by
mistake
of
the
registrant
and
the
board
attempts
to
accelerate
him
under
a
strict
reading
of
the
regulations
that
this
is
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
board.
that
it
is
only
willful
violations
on
the
part
of
registrants
and
not
only
willful,
but
a
violation
in
which
the
registrant
shows
no
desire
to
come
back
in
to
compliance
again
with
the
regulations.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
was
not
offered
a
new
draft
card,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
but
on
page
44
of
the
appendix
is
a
copy
of
the
delinquency
notice
that
was
sent
to
mr.
gutknecht
in
this
case.
and
in
that
delinquency
notice,
in
paragraph
two
it
said,
“you
are
hereby
directed
to
report
to
the
local
board
immediately
in
person
or
by
mail
or
to
take
this
notice
to
the
local
board
nearest
to
you
for
advice
as
to
what
you
should
do.”
now,
mr.
gutknecht
did
not
do
that,
he
said
that
because
five
days
later,
he
was
reclassified
that
this
in
effect
did
not
give
him
the
amount
of
notice
that
he
needed
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance.
if
he
had
tried
to
get
himself
back
into
compliance
by
showing
a
willingness
to
possess
his
cards
at
anytime,
prior
to
induction
or
certainly
prior
to
the
notice
of
induction,
i
think
that
again
clearly
the
board
would
have
been
abusing
its
discretion
by
not
permitting
him
to
come
back
into
compliance.
this
is
consistent
with
our
theory
of
the
delinquency
regulations
not
being
punishment,
but
being
remedial
in
their
effect.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
respectfully
would
state
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
the
board
has
given
discretion
without
question
under
the
regulation,
but
i
think
like
any
discretionary
grant,
there
is
--
there
are
times
when
that
can
be
abused.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
consistent
with
the
analysis
of
civil
contempt
in
this
case
that
where
someone
attempts
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
for
the
regulations.
there's
a
clear
abuse
and
in
this
court
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
breen
he
could
bring
himself
back
into
compliance,
by
simply
agreeing
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
he
was
not
--
in
breen,
he
has
never
been
given
an
induction.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
has
never
been
given
--
yes,
he
has
never
been
given
a
notice
of
induction.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he's
doing
it
in
a
criminal
action,
which
were
here
before
this
court,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
under
the
regulation,
under
the
law,
under
section
10
(b)
3
this
is
the
vehicle
which
he
can
use
to
test
his
rights.
and
that's
precisely
what
he's
doing
here
in
this
court
and
as
a
further
example
of
what
i'm
saying
in
number
623,
before
this
court.
now,
troutman
against
united
states,
a
confession
of
error,
a
virtual
confession
of
error
will
be
filled
by
the
justice
department,
by
the
solicitor
general,
but
tomorrow
where
mr.
troutman
attempted
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
attempting
to
focus
what
mr.
gutknecht
could
have
done
in
order
to
bring
himself
back
into
compliance
and
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
if
the
draft
boards,
if
the
boards
themselves
do
not
permit
him
to
come
back
into
compliance,
we're
prepared
to
confess
error,
we're
prepared
to
admit
that
they
have
abused
their
discretion.
and
i
think
in
the
grant,
in
the
regulations
themselves,
where
it
says
he
may
--
the
board
itself
may
change
its
mind
at
anytime.
and
another
regulation
writ
says
it
may
reopen
the
whole
proceedings
as
to
his
classification
at
anytime.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
look
at
a
discretionary
grant
assuming
that
is
going
to
be
abused.
obviously,
with
over
four
thousand
draft
boards
in
this
country,
there
are
abuses.
i
would
not
stand
here
and
say
they
weren't,
but
where
abuses
are
found,
where
abuses
of
that
discretionary
grant
to
the
board
are
found,
there
is
a
process
by
which
those
abuses
can
be
set
right
and
i
think
just
as
any
administrative
board
is
given
a
discretion,
where
that
discretion
is
abused,
the
person
who
is
wrong
has
a
power
and
a
right
to
raise
that
wrong
in
the
court
of
law.
and
if
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
those
who
are
meant
to
enforce
the
law,
then
this
is
the
way
it
works
in
any
case,
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
the
last
one
to
admit
the
abuse
of
discretion
or
the
solicitor
general
in
this
court.
i
don't
see
that
that's
any
difference,
in
terms
of
a
grant
of
discretion
to
the
draft
boards
and
it
is
to
any
other
administrative
agency.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that's
only
thing
that
cures
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
could
cure?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
he
has
the
right
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
it.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
our
position.
this
is
our
position
that
this
is
clearly
what
is
intended
by
the
regulations
themselves,
when
they
say
that
the
classification
maybe
reopened
at
anytime,
without
regard
to
other
regulations.
that
he
has
the
right,
when
he's
reclassified
to
notice
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
he
has
the
right
to
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board.
that
the
--
that
these
regulations
read
as
a
whole
clearly
draw
the
analogy
between
civil
contempt
that
we
have
drawn
and
make
then
remedial.
the
question
of
punishment
that
mr.
justice
marshall
addressed
himself
to
yesterday,
i
think
is
very
much
involved
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
delinquency
regulations
themselves
amount
to
punishment,
the
acceleration
and
that
if
it
does
amount
to
punishment,
is
it
done
so
without
due
process
or
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
guarantee.
now,
yesterday
when
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
about
what
the
punishment
--
the
question
that
bothered
you
that
there
maybe
elements
of
punishment
in
the
delinquency
regulations.
the
counsel
jumped
with
glee
in
his
rebuttal
argument
that
i
was
willing
to
admit
there
maybe
elements
of
punishment.
i
think
that
really
it
would
do
this
court
a
little
good
to
get
into
so
many
called
argument
of
just
exactly
what
amounts
to
punishment.
it
is
our
position
on
page
39
and
following
of
our
brief
that
some
of
the
indicia
of
legal
punishment
are
present
here,
just
as
they
were
--
the
outlined
in
the
kennedy
mendoza
case.
among
those
indicia
that
are
outline
of
that
case
is
their
sanctions
that
are
here,
ultimately
involved
an
affirmative
disability.he
is
going
to
be
restrained,
if
he's
in
the
army.
secondly,
it
comes
in
to
play
on
finding
of
scienter,
this
is
in
line
with
our
theory
that
there
has
to
be
a
willful
violation
of
the
regulations
and
a
willful
refusal
to
come
back
into
compliance
for
the
regulations,
before
the
board
has
properly
exercised
this
discretion
in
declaring
some
one
delinquent.
thirdly,
the
behavior
to
which
it
applies
is
already
a
crime
and
this
is
true
in
this
case.
it
is
already
a
crime
of
the
violation
to
the
regulations.
does
it
promote
one
of
the
traditional
aims
of
punishment,
in
deterrence
and
retribution,
which
were
named
in
the
kennedy-mendoza
case.
now,
i
think
that
while
there
are
some
questions
about
the
deterrence
as
being
only
used
and
only
defined
in
terms
of
punishment
that
there
are
deterrent
aspects
of
this.
but,
there
are
indicia
that
do
not
point
to
punishment,
as
outlined
in
the
kennedy-mendoza.
induction
is
not
historically
been
regarded
as
punishment.
secondly,
whether
there's
an
alternative
purpose
maybe
assigned,
a
non
penal
purpose
assigned
into
the
regulations
involved.
and
i
think
delinquency
regulations
do
have
an
alternative
purpose.
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
is
essentially
two
fold,
is
to
induce
cooperation
with
the
selective
service
system
on
the
part
of
all
draft
eligible
men
and
this
is
where
the
civil
contempt
analogy
comes
in.
because
if
we're
trying
to
define
this
in
a
remedial
sense,
that
we're
trying
to
get
cooperation
here,
just
as
in
a
civil
contempt
proceeding
if
somebody
comes
back
into
compliance.
and
if
he
does
what
the
regulations
say,
then
he
will
be
put
back
into
his
prior
classification,
otherwise
there
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
regulations
is
to
cure
what
has
happened
and
not
to
punish
what
has
happened
and
just
as
in
the
troutman
case,
we
have
confessed
there
and
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
do
so
in
any
instance
in
this
court
or
in
any
court,
where
it
was
shown
that
an
effort
was
made
to
cure
the
error.
the
second
purpose
--
which
is
a
non
penal
purpose,
is
the
maintenance
of
the
non
delinquent
morale.
those
who
do
comply
with
the
regulations,
it
should
not,
it
seems
to
me
be
discouraged
by
the
success
of
those
who
do
not.
and
for
this
reason,
i
think
there
is
a
good
purpose
of
the
--
alternative
purpose
of
the
statute.
but
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
i
think
to
get
into
an
argument
in
this
court
about
whether
this
amounted
to
legal
punishment
might
really
cause
the
court
to
miss
the
point.
because
the
point
in
this
case
is
why
are
we
talking
about
punishment?
we're
talking
about
punishment,
in
terms
of
the
delinquency
regulations
to
find
whether
he
has
been
deprived
of
due
process
or
is
stiff
in
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
what
is
in
this
case
the
punishment
of
which
mr.
gutknecht
the
petitioner
complains.
it
is
accelerated
induction.
this
is
what
he
complaints
of
and
before
he
can
be
inducted
in
an
accelerated
manner,
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
induction,
just
as
he
did
here.
and
thereby,
submit
himself
to
a
criminal
prosecution
in
which
he
has
the
full
panoply
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
and,
i
think
this
is
a
clear
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
case
in
mendoza-martinez,
where
the
court
went
in
to
the
admittedly
difficult
question
of
what
amounts
to
punishment
and
what
doesn't.
because
mr.
mendoza
was
never
given
a
hearing,
he
was
denationalized.
he
left
the
country,
in
order
to
avoid
the
grant
and
having
left,
he
was
immediately
denationalized.
he
had
no
right
to
a
hearing,
to
contest
their
denationalization.
there
was
no
way
he
could
bring
up
a
contesting
of
his
rights
and
the
court
there
said
that
that
was
punishment
and
without
the
due
process
or
fourth
or
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
which
he
should
have.
i
think
we
can
draw
an
analogy
between
what
has
happened
here
and
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
now,
when
a
man
is
indicted
under
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
he
is
in
a
very
real
sense
punished.
he
maybe
put
in
jail
if
he
is
indicted
and
without
bail,
if
it's
a
non-bailable
offense
or
bail
maybe
set
so
high
that
he
can't
meet
it,
and
he
stayed
there.
he
has
had
none
of
his
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
rights
and
probably
a
little
due
process
at
that
time.
but
in
this
case,
where
the
board
itself
has
found
him
delinquent,
because
he's
violated
one
of
the
regulations,
i
say
the
analogy
between
this
and
the
grand
jury
is
very
close.
and
secondly,
as
far
as
the
board
hearing
itself
is
concerned,
he
is
given
notice
of
the
delinquency
itself.
the
notice
that
i
read,
they're
right
on
page
44
of
the
appendix,
where
it
says,
“come
in,
until
let
us
tell
you
how
we
can
show
you
how
to
avoid
a
further
delinquency.”
in
this
case,
he
would
have
in
my
estimation,
although
it
is
contested
by
the
petitioners,
if
he
had
asked
for
a
hearing,
he
would
have
been
given
one.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
asked
for
a
hearing
in
this
case,
because
what
was
there
to
hear?
he
had
turned
in
his
draft
card.
they're
not
going
to
hear
whether
he
is
willing
to
take
them
back
or
not,
there
is
no
fact
situation
for
the
board
to
hear.
there
is
a
clear
regulation,
which
mr.
gutknecht
violated
and
under
that
regulation,
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
board
to
apply
the
delinquency
regulations,
which
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
again
under
our
theory,
he
would
have
the
right
to
purge
himself
from
this
violation
because
i
think
had
he
shown
a
desire
to
do
so
and
the
board
had
refused
to
let
him
do
it,
we
would
have
been
the
first
to
confess
error,
but
he
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
and
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
fact
situation,
which
would
have
--
this
court
could
focus
on,
to
say
whether
the
procedural
due
process
in
the
hearing
at
the
board
level
has
been
violated.
now,
i
submit
that
the
kennedy-mendoza
analysis
is
simply
not
sufficient
in
this
case
to
determine
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
legal
punishment.
i
think
there
are
some
differences,
but
even
if
you
find
that
the
line
between
punishment
and
non
punishment.
if
you
find
this
false
slightly
over
the
line
toward
punishment.
i
think
that
even
if
that
is
true,
he
has
been
given
at
one
stage,
at
the
end
of
this
process,
all
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
he
has
been
given
a
complete
due
process.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
the
statutory
framework
that
the
congress
has
setup
whereby
this
man
could
raise
his
rights
and
there
is
no
such
statutory
framework
in
the
kennedy-mendoza
situation.
now,
the
other
argument
of
the
petitioner
was
in
their
brief
that
even
if
it
wasn't
punishment,
we
have
not
provided
the
procedural
due
process
that
is
necessary
and
i
think
in
pointing
out
that
he
did
receive
notice,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
regulations
would
be
that
he
could
receive
a
hearing,
if
he
so
requested.
now,
this
is
a
completely
speculative
question
before
this
court,
because
he
didn't
request
to
hear
it.
either
before
he
received
the
delinquency
notice
or
after
he
received
his
reclassification.
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
heard
to
complain
here,
when
he
has
not
asked
for
a
hearing.
as
far
as
the
variance
between
the
charge
and
the
proof
is
concerned,
i
think
that
that
is
fairly
stated
in
the
brief
and
that
i
think
that
question,
plus
the
argument
that
the
affidavit
itself,
where
indictment
itself
was
duplicitous,
boarders
on
the
frivolous.
now,
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
clearly
point
out
that
the
questions
involved.
yesterday,
we
discussed
the
problem
of
congressional
authorization.
and
i
think
that
in
the
broad
sense,
that
the
delinquency
regulations
are
a
fair
grant
to
the
administrative
branch
by
congress
of
an
effort
to
implement
what
is
admittedly
a
difficult
statute.
to
implement
a
selective
service
law
in
a
time
in
this
country
in
which
many
people
are
opposed
to
the
results
that
might
occur
from
going
into
the
army.
but
i
think
that
given
the
policy
as
set
down
by
the
congress
in
the
executive
branch,
that
this
is
a
fair
way
of
implementing
that
policy.
and
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
below
and
uphold
the
delinquency
regulations
as
adapted
by
the
president.
