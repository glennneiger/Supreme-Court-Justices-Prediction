justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering,
is
the
correct
analysis
really
that
waiver
or
is
it
rather
when
may
a
courtroom,
the
right
to
be
present
by
this
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
in
this
instance
as
i
understand
it
this
respondent
was
funded
protested.

j.

his
removal
from
the
beginning.
now,
really
he
was
absent
voluntarily
in
that
sense,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
dealt
waiver,
haven't
we
ordinarily
and
in
terms
of
a
voluntary
relinquishment
of
a
known
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
is
it
this
really
a
question
whether
the
constitutional
right
has
been
forfeited
by
the
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
at
least
more
realistic
perhaps
more
honest
analysis?
