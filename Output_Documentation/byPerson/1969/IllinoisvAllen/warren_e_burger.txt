now,
this
disruptive
conduct
began
at
the
very
moment
that
the
proceedings
opened
before
they
had
picked
the
jury,
doesn't
it?
chief

warren
e.

well
didn't
he
tell
the
judge
that
in
so
many
words
at
the
outset
there
is
going
to
be
no
trial?

stage
of
the

that
he
was

destroy
the
trial
(voice

but
how
many
times
did
the

warn
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
read
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
opinion,
they
didn't
say
it
was
a
waiver
but
that
is
conduct
operated
as
a
waiver.
is
that
not
about
the
way
they
put
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
equated
it
to
a
waiver
rather
than
saying
that
it
was
a
waiver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
their
precise
language
was
such
misconduct
was
in
turn
effective
as
a
waiver.
it
has
the

effect.

would
you
raise
your
voice
counsel,
we
seem
to
have
a
little
difficulty

today.
chief

warren
e.

how
is
this
relevant
now
on
our
issue?
chief

warren
e.

but
that
issue
is
out
of
this
case
long
since,
isn't
it?
you
haven't
raised
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

this
is
all
very
interesting
but
did
you
propose
that
some
time
or
did
the
counsel
propose
(voice

it
was
a

it

--
chief

warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
was
a
viable
alternative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
this
seems
to
be
the
theory
that
this
numbly
disabled
defendant
had
from
the
start
and
reading
from
a
transcript
here
where
he
said
to
the
judge
after
getting
his
second
warning,
you
have
the
right
to
restrain
me

you
haven't
got
the

to
remove
me
and
you're
not
going

remove
me.

that's
the
theory
of
your
case
here
and
that
was
his
theory

of
the
trial.
chief

warren
e.

pretty
good
analysis
on
his
part?
chief

i
thought
you
were
arguing
a
little
earlier
that
he
shouldn't
been
bound

gagged
and
kept
all
the

wouldn't
that
be
