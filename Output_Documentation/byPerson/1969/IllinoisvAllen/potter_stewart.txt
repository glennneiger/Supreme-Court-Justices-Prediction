certainly,
i
suppose
general
flaum
that
all
would
agree
that
a
trial
judge
is
in

of
a
great
discretion
and
what
procedures
he
is
going

follow

room.
no
question
about
that
but
here
we
have
a
claim
of
a
violation
of
a
specific
constitutional
right
that
i.e,
the
right
of
confrontation.
so,
the
fact,
there's
great
discretion
really
doesn't
meet
the

isn't
it?

i
understand

your

waive
the

that
there
was
no
denial
of
the

of

i

your
argument
was
the

when
it

when
you
began
talking
about
how

the
right
of
cross-examinations

counsel

your
argument
is
that
he
waived
it.
justice

you
do

that

had
there
been

it

very
