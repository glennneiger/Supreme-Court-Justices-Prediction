mr.
joel
m.
flaum
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
with
argument
at
the
suggestion
of
the
office
of
the
clerk
this
morning,
i
was
informed
that
correspondent
from
respondent's
attorney
failed
to
reach
the
court
that
was
dated
february
20
at
1970.
in
that
correspondence
the
asked
that
the
court
please
disregard
the
second
argument
entitled
the
case
is
moot,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
to
entertain
that
and
unless
there
are
questions
in
that
regard,
the
petitioner
would
stand
on
his
brief
on
that
point.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
argued
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
it
would
want
to
–
with
this
position
i
would
like
to
go
forward.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
your
honor
i
will.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
justice
douglas
this
was
filed
by
the
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
state
of
illinois,
is
the
petitioner.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
point
was
raised
in
the
respondent's
brief,
we
replied
in
a
reply
brief.
and
then
the
letter
was
forth
coming
last
week
from
the
respondent
asking
that
it
would
be
withdrawn
as
a
point.
turning
to
the
instant
case,
your
honor,
the
case
which
we
feel
is
one
of
the
first
impressions
certainly,
factually
before
this
court.
however,
a
little
more
than
100
years
ago
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york,
when
george
davis
was
put
on
trial
for
perjury,
shortly
after
the
onset
of
that
trial,
the
defendant
became
unruly.
this
was
during
certain
statements
being
made
by
the
prosecutor.
the
defendant
was
removed
from
the
court
during
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
trial
judge
ruled.
he
was
absent
during
a
part
of
the
opening
only
because
of
his
own
disorderly
conduct.
it
does
not
lie
in
his
mouth
to
complain
of
an
order
which
was
made
necessary
by
his
own
misconduct.
now,
101
years
later
people
in
the
state
of
illinois
asked
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
illinois
v.
allen.
allen
was
indicted
for
armed
robbery
in
1956,
tried
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
illinois
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
10
to
30
years
in
the
penitentiary.
he
is
presently
on
parole
and
i
am
informed
that
parole
--
from
beginning
of
the
trial,
allen
insisted
on
his
right
to
question
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
examination,
embarked
on
deliberate
and
knowing
course
of
disruption
outburst
and
threats
which
finally
culminated
in
his
removal
from
the
courtroom
during
most
of
the
presentation
of
a
states'
case.
we
contend
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
present
your
honor
for
the
entire
defense.
in
fact,
relative
calm
was
to
obtain
when
the
defense
began
its
presentation.
he
was
left;
he
was
taken
out
during
the
voir
dire
examination
which
he
was
conducting.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
not
there
for
the
opening.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
not
of
the
states'
case.
he
was
given
opportunity
to
come
back
immediately
after
and
before
the
voir
dire,
and
immediately
before
the
presentation
of
the
states'
case.
invitation
was
extended
by
the
trial
judge
through
counsel
to
have
him
return.
the
dialog
upon
his
return
was
such
that
it
clearly
informed
the
trial
judges.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
was.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
throughout
the
entire
states'
case.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
did.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
did,
your
honor
i
would
draw
that
i'm
not
sure
if
he
chose
to
be
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
is.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
by
both.
the
reason
we
contend
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
is
that
pleading
of
the
court
of
appeals
even
in
its
majority
opinion
as
well
as
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
the
dissent
of
seventh
circuit
and
the
opinion
--
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
clearly
on
agreement
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct
here.
of
the
10
reviewing
judges
who
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
record
all
10
agreed
on
the
conduct
only
two
felt
constrained
by
the
constitutional
prohibition
as
they
read
it
to
rule
that
allen
was
unlawfully
removed
from
his
trial.
just
briefly,
the
respondent
threatened
the
life
of
the
trial
judge,
ripped
his
attorney's
file
and
arranged
the
court
in
such
a
way
that
the
judge
felt
his
removal
was
necessary.
i
might
add
that
there
was
a
warning
in
all
of
these
cases.
some
of
the
commentators
on
this
area
have
suggested
that
if
this
rule
of
exclusion
is
allowed
that
it
be
appropriately
done
in
areas
where
there
are
warning.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
majority
opinion
found
adequate
warning
by
the
trial
judge
and
i
suggest
there
is
more
than
one
warning
included
in
the
administrators
from
the
trial
court
for
the
respondent
to
remain
silent.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
the
trial
took
approximately
two-and-a
half
days.
it
was
a
jury
trial;
it
was
a
simple
case
of
an
armed
robbery
of
a
tavern.
allen
was
identified
by
the
bartender
and
in
turn
allen
identified
the
victim.
the
defense
was
insanity
in
--
the
year-and-a-half
before
the
defendant
had
been
declared
incompetent.
he
had
been
restored
and
his
defense
from
sanity
was
rejected
by
the
trier
of
fact.
we
are
here
today
because
we
feel,
we
have
asked
this
court
to
review
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
compels
the
result
which
the
seventh
circuit
reluctantly
i
might
add
arrived
at.
we
feel
that
the
right
of
confrontation
through
its
birth
in
the
common
law,
certainly
and
its
adoption
by
the
sixth
amendment
wasn't
meant
to
broaden
the
exceptions
that
the
common
law
recognizes.
and
this
court
in
1926
in
salinger
versus
united
states
specifically
mentioned
that
while
the
common
law
was
brought
into
the
purview
of
the
sixth
amendment's
right
to
confrontation
it
certainly
wasn't
meant
to
make
the
exceptions
not
included
in
that
new
amendment.
this
court
had
in
diaz
versus
the
united
states
in
1912
clearly
addressed
itself
to
the
issue
of
waiver.
now,
in
that
case
the
murder
case
out
of
the
philippines
tried
on
the
philippine
code,
the
court
concluded
that
what
they
were
reviewing
was
a
substantial
equivalent
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
court
--
the
issue
in
diaz
as
presented
or
the
claim
made
was
that
the
supreme
court
--
in
the
supreme
court
here
that
he
did
not
waive
the
right
of
confrontation
but
that
he
could
not
waive
it.
this
court
held
that
waiver
was
possible,
was
permissible
and
did
obtain
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
voluntarily
left.
the
court
sent
a
message
to
the
presiding
judge
that
he
wouldn't
return.
significant,
we
feel
in
this
case
are
two
things.
one,
the
davis
case
which
the
only
direct
american
president
other
than
the
prior
illinois
case
in
1956.
on
this
point
was
mentioned
in
davis
favorably
--
in
diaz
favorably
and
what
is
significant
is
that
diaz
they're
residing
davis
which
was
an
involuntary
removal
case.
we
feel
that
if
waiver
is
recognized,
certainly
the
waiver
by
an
escapee
from
a
courtroom
that
the
unruly
defendant
is
not
be
accorded
treatment
different
in
the
escapee.
diaz
makes
it
clear
that
a
defendant
walks
out
or
escapes,
waives
his
right
to
be
present
as
the
trial
can
continue.
we
believe
there's
no
difference
between
a
defendant
who
walks
out
of
the
courtroom
and
a
defendant
who
was
ordered
to
move
because
his
courtroom
conduct
makes
a
fair
and
orderly
trial
impossible.
if
there's
waiver
in
the
prior
case
--
the
former
case,
we
think
there's
waiver
in
a
latter.
now,
on
the
issue
of
whether
waiver
has
been
recognized
our
research
indicates
only
the
davis
case
in
1869,
two
english
cases,
one
a
felony
case,
one
is
misdemeanor
case,
rex
v.
brown
and
rex
v.
berry,
also
in
the
19th
century.
but
it's
been
never
rejected
by
court
of
review
as
we
confine.
further,
we
suggest
that
this
court
in
dictum
in
the
diaz
case
in
a
subsequent
case
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
has
adopted
the
waiver
principal
and
that
the
dictum
allows
for
its
application
here.
i
might
add
that
in
dictum,
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
the
capital
case
involving
whether
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
view
the
scene
when
the
jury
left
to
do
that.
mr.
justice
cardozo
specifically
added
--
no
doubt,
the
privilege
of
confrontation
may
be
lost
by
consent
or
even
at
times
by
misconduct.
so,
in
the
schneider
versus
massachusetts
case
that
wasn't
an
issue
when
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor
we
have
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did.
yes
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
think
in
--
if
i
might
disagree
to
an
extent
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
feel
waiver
is
applicable
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
the
dialogue
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
one
of
not
a
lack
of
communication.
they
seem
to
be
understanding,
the
warning
seem
to
be
clear.
certainly
when
one
reads
the
record
in
this
case,
the
defendant
had
no
problem
in
making
his
intentions
known.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
they
set
a
patient
and
very
tolerant
judge.
i
think
that
when
the
dialog
reaches
the
level
it
did
in
this
case
where
the
inclusions
of
the
warnings,
which
might
result
if
in
fact
the
conduct
does
not
cease
that
waiver
would
not
be
stretching
the
concept
to
apply
it
here.
i
think
it
would
also
lend
to
a
more
flexible
rule
of
discretion
and
if
i
might
suggest
a
more
easy
handle
for
courts
below,
if
this
court
so
ruled
that
waiver
was
permissible
in
this
instance.
we
find
that
the
commentators
while
acknowledging
limited
authority
on
the
case
seem
to
be
pretty
much
unanimous
in
their
feeling
at
least
to
the
visceral
one
that
removal
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
we
in
our
study
found
that
the
development
of
the
right
to
be
present
was
early
cast
in
jurisdictional
terms
and
we
suggest
that
if
it
has
any
vitality
today
it
may
only
be
perhaps
in
capital
cases
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
one
of
the
remedies
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
suggest
that
we
just
broaden
the
trial
judge's
discretion
to
include
this
as
one
along
with
content
and
what
apparently
has
been
permitted
by
lower
court's
binding
and
gagging.
our
feeling
is
that
it
doesn't
fall
outside
binding
and
gagging.
in
fact,
it's
a
much
more
reasonable
and
much
more
desirable
end
for
justice
to
have
the
exclusion
when
it's
positive
under
the
case
like
this.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
that
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
will.
we
feel
that
there
is
--
the
policy
reasons
toward
adopting
the
exclusion
over
other
forms
are
one,
contempt
may
not
really
satisfy
the
situation.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
man
faced
to
the
possible
life
sentence.
our
feeling
is
that
contempt
in
cases
like
that
may
not
live
level
well
with
a
defendant
bent
on
disrupting
the
trial.
we
feel
the
scene
of
binding
and
gagging
and
i
question
whether
the
right
of
confrontation
is
any
better
preserved
by
the
defendant
found
gagging
and
maniacal.
it
brings
the
service
to
the
court
that
in
which
this
action
takes
place.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
justice
black,
in
this
case
below,
the
defendant
at
the
outset
announced
his
unwillingness
really
to
participate
in
the
trial
processing.
he
informs
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that
he
would
not
participate
in
the
trial.
not
in
a
voluntary
passion.
he
informed
the
court,
“you
have
a
right
to
restrain
me,
but
you
haven't
got
the
right
to
remove
me
and
you're
not
going
to
remove
me.”
and
that
the
court
replied,
we
will
determine
that.
the
defendant,
“no
you're
not,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
trial,
i'm
going
to
sit
here
and
you're
going
to
talk
and
you
can
bring
out
your
shackles
and
straight
jacket
and
put
them
on
me
and
take
my
mouth
but
it
will
do
no
good
because
there's
going
to
be
no
trial.”
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did,
prior
to
noon
recess,
--
another
time
i
mean
to
stress
very
strongly
your
honors
how
tolerant
this
trial
judge
was.
the
defendant
announced
that
the
judge
would
be
a
corps
upon
his
return
--
defense
return
from
the
lunch
time
--
lunch
recess.
there
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
in
custody
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
the
record
is
vague
but
there
is
some
indication
that
when
this
defendant
left
the
courtroom
and
went
to
the
anteroom
he
intended
to
be
a
little
physical
with
the
property
in
the
lock
up.
so,
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
yes
it
is.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
i
do
not,
i
think
it's
a
lesser
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
a
milder
form
of
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
i
understand.
but
when
you
said
it's
on
the
same
level
i
--
we
might
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
(inaudible)
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yeah,
well
i
think
the
exclusion
is
much
more
preferable
remedy
to
that
and
a
much
milder.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
our
view
that
it
would
the
shackling
and
gagging
what
it's
brought
with
is
the
parallel
prejudice
to
the
existing
procedure
in
addition
to
disruptive
conduct
that
may
be
taking
place
by
the
defendant's
actions.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice
it
preceded
that
because
in
pretrial
before
another
judge
of
the
cook
county
circuit
court
where
he
made
a
motion
for
a
change
of
judges
--
substitution
judges
we
thought
is
based
on
prejudice.
he
again
there
caused
some
sort
of
a
scene
and
we
--
so
you
can
trace
it
back
there.
but,
yes
this
started
immediately
and
we
suggest
upon
no
propagation.
there's
an
absence
totally
of
any
dialog
for
example
between
a
prosecutor
and
the
defendant.
so,
there's
no
act
of
--
to
state
apart
from
the
judge
in
incurring
the
raft
of
the
defendant
by
any
spoken
word
in
the
opening
statement
or
the
like.
your
honors,
we
would
add
one
other
fact
and
that
is
that
we
recognized
in
whenever
asking
this
court
to
acknowledge
broader
jurisdiction
discretion
and
a
trial
judge
--
that's
a
weighty
problem.
however,
if
the
police
of
this
country
can
be
entrusted
with
stock
and
first
discretion
which
we
suggest
is
a
low
visibility
situation.
certainly,
the
entrusting
to
a
trial
judge
subject
to
appropriate
review
of
the
opportunity
to
expel
and
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
our
position
is
this,
that
we
recognize
we're
asking
for
the
recognition
of
a
broad
discretion
in
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
recognizing
that
in
any
discretion
case,
there's
a
chance
that
the
review
is
always
difficult
because
of
the
area
of
discretion
and
is
quite
often
intruded
by
court
of
appeals
in
very
limited
fashion
entrusting
great
beliefs
that
a
trial
judge
normally
acts
very
fairly.
we
say
this
is
not
a
low
visibility
situation.
we're
trying
to
lay
any
fear
in
that
regard
that
this
will
not
become
a
wholesale
tool
of
a
judge
annoyed
with
the
look,
smart
talk
of
a
defendant.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
on
that
specific
point
mr.
justice
stewart
i
would
agree.
however,
on
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right,
constitutional
right
commentators
in
this
court
have
recognized
is
mainly
to
ensure
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination
and
it's
a
collateral
benefit
of
that,
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses.
certainly,
exclusion
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
true
but
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
stewart
in
barber
and
page
the
last
sixth
amendment
case,
not
at
all
on
point
but
written
by
this
court
in
'68.
the
first
to
stress
that
i
don't
mean
to
exclude
that
the
third
but
--
in
more
field
that
first
to
it
are
the
greater.
in
this
case,
the
counsel
continued
with
the
cross-examination
--
there
wasn't
that
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
certainly
remained
a
possibility
because
none
of
them
were
excluded.
it
seems
to
us
that
he
reach
a
point
and
that
constitutional
right,
you
cannot
have
both
--
you
can't
be
entitled
the
both,
the
right
and
a
ruin
of
it.
and
it
seems
that
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
ruin
of
it,
and
it
seems
here
that
we
have
a
case
where
defendant
is
bent
on
and
clearly
by
his
statements
so
destroying
any
right.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
exactly.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
feel
mr.
chief
justice
that's
at
least
one
of
three
clear
indications
that
he
--
when
brought
back
and
insisted
that
there
would
be
no
trial
in
two
of
the
returns
where
the
invitation
of
the
judge
that
you
have
a
record
that
seems
to
me
patently
clear
in
an
attempt
by
the
judge
to
bring
the
defendant
around
to
reasonable
conduct
and
a
clearing
decision
by
the
defendant
to
in
no
way
entertain
it
until
and
this
is
significant
until
the
defense
began
and
then
there
was
calm.
in
fact,
we
found
the
defendant
stating
in
affect
that
he
realized
that
his
conduct
was
improper.
it
can
also
stand
as
a
certain
reflective
process
that
he
probably
had
throughout
the
trial
but
just
chose
to
use
in
one
case
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
find
at
least
three
and
perhaps
four
--
for
the
fourth
one,
mr.
chief
justice
has
to
be
a
reading
into
statements.
it
does
include
the
word,
“warn.”
court
of
appeal's
majority
opinion
in
reversing
concluded
that
he
was
warned
and
did
not
spell
it
up.
but
they
found
as
well
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
a
warning
encompassed
in
the
dialog
between
the
judges.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
this
man
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
right,
he
is
on
parole.
and
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
he
would
be
no
longer
subject
to
any
of
the
vital
consequences
that
stem
from
a
pro-violator
and
he
has
year
or
so
or
more
to
go.
so
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor,
we
feel
that
he
can
either
try
a
contempt
citation
or
he
has
to
bind
and
gag
him
and
in
this
--
in
my
jurisdiction
and
in
my
city
we
had
the
unsightly
scene
of
a
bound
and
gag
defendant
recently
with
the
federal
marshall
placing
his
hands
in
front
of
the
gag
so
that
no
words
would
come
forward
through
the
gag.
now
-
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
i
do,
i'm
familiar
with
that
case.
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
it's
our
view
that
not
only
must
justice
be
done
but
there
ought
to
be
the
appearance
of
justice
and
if
i
might
in
that
assumption,
we
do
a
tremendous
disservice
to
promoting
that
kind
of
a
scene
and
in
the
rewarding
conduct
which
in
no
way
one
can
sympathize
with.
if
we
have
got
an
incompetent
defendant
then
he
shouldn't
be
on
trial.
but
certainly
one
which
is
a
pure
deliberate
act
of
volition
as
it
was
in
this
case,
it's
very
hard
to
not
find
that
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
right
have
been
exhausted.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
acknowledge
in
the
stricter
sense
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
a
classic
denial
--
if
the
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
presupposes
never
removing
a
defendant
from
the
view
of
the
actual
trial
scene
and
we
acknowledge
that.
what
i
was
suggesting
perhaps
not
too
clearly
was
that
of
the
--
what
commentators
have
suggested
are
meaningful
benefits
of
the
right
of
confrontation.
we're
not
totally
denied
when
he
had
counsel
continuing
to
go
forward
with
the
cross-examination.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that
he
waived
it.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
it
was
violent.
the
removal
is
a
technical
violation,
if
one
can
call
up
into
play
the
word
“violation”
if
you
buy
our
waiver.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
it
would
have
been
a
violation.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is
mr
chief
justice
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
correct,
i
would
imagine
that
i've
been
opposing
simply
because
as
a
trial,
i'm
used
to
the
waiver
of
the
signed
paper,
of
the
jury
waiver
or
whatever
but
you're
absolutely
correct.
they
did
not
call
it
direct
waiver
as
much
as
they
did
by
interpreting
it
from
the
conduct
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
not
a
forfeiture.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yeah,
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
there
is
right
of
the
state
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
feel
that
the
right
of
the
state
cannot
be
denied
to
the
trial
and
to
acknowledge
his
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
we
feel
he
does
not
lie
within
his
kin
to
make
that
ultimate
decision.
i
think
he
didn't
--
i
think
he
did
not
want
to
be
tried
or
he
certainly
he
didn't
want
or
perhaps
i
might
suggest
mr.
justice
black
that
maybe
he
did
want
to
be
tried
but
in
furtherance
of
his
particular
defense,
this
kind
of
disrupted
conduct
may
have
been
very
calculated.
that's
just
our
position
of
course
in
(voice
overlaps).
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is.
those
are
his
statements,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
just
suggested
that
our
theory
be
labeled
waiver,
we
felt
because
it's
one
that
we
think
is
very
workable
if
in
--
by
that
i
mean
the
trial
judge
reasonably
interpreting
conduct
can
find
a
waiver
in
a
situation
like
that.
that's
why
we
have
leaned
toward
the
waiver
conducts
also
because
as
our
reading
of
the
dictum
of
cases
that
could
preferably
dealt
with
waiver
in
this
court
that
words
like
--
that
he
can
waive
it
by
his
misconduct
as
mr.
justice
cardozo
said,
suggest
to
us
that
was
the
route
that
we
might
appropriately
offer
up
to
this
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
technically
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
as
if
he
would,
that's
true.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
sir.
perhaps
we
should
have
practiced
our
claims
of
waiver
as
effective
as
a
waiver.
we
just
felt,
it
would
not
be
misleading
to
offer
up
to
this
court
the
concept
nakedly
as
waiver
and
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
one
of
the
application
if
accepted
by
the
court.
i
wonder
if
i
might
reserve
a
minute
or
two
for
reply?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
on
the
two
main
cases
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
writing
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts,
mr.
justice
cardozo
stated
hopt
v.
utah
has
been
distinguished
and
limited
and
what
was
said
in
hopt
v.
utah
under
subject
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant
was
dictum
and
no
more,
we
may
say
the
same
of
lewis
versus
the
united
states
and
if
i
might
state
the
second
on
the
state
of
the
record
mr.
kelly
who
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
below
was
appointed
on
october
14th
the
next
proceedings
were
december
11
in
the
case.
he
was
granted
the
right
to
be
co-counsel
in
his
case.
it
was
only
when
he
was
disrupted
during
the
voir
dire
that
the
judge
asked
that
he
let
his
counsel
take
over
and
that's
when
first
right
ensued,
and
leave
the
court
with
justice
stewart.
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
can
be
sustained
only
by
the
most
slavish
reading
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
with
argument
at
the
suggestion
of
the
office
of
the
clerk
this
morning,
i
was
informed
that
correspondent
from
respondent's
attorney
failed
to
reach
the
court
that
was
dated
february
20
at
1970.
in
that
correspondence
the
asked
that
the
court
please
disregard
the
second
argument
entitled
the
case
is
moot,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
to
entertain
that
and
unless
there
are
questions
in
that
regard,
the
petitioner
would
stand
on
his
brief
on
that
point.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
argued
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
it
would
want
to
–
with
this
position
i
would
like
to
go
forward.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
your
honor
i
will.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
justice
douglas
this
was
filed
by
the
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
state
of
illinois,
is
the
petitioner.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
point
was
raised
in
the
respondent's
brief,
we
replied
in
a
reply
brief.
and
then
the
letter
was
forth
coming
last
week
from
the
respondent
asking
that
it
would
be
withdrawn
as
a
point.
turning
to
the
instant
case,
your
honor,
the
case
which
we
feel
is
one
of
the
first
impressions
certainly,
factually
before
this
court.
however,
a
little
more
than
100
years
ago
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york,
when
george
davis
was
put
on
trial
for
perjury,
shortly
after
the
onset
of
that
trial,
the
defendant
became
unruly.
this
was
during
certain
statements
being
made
by
the
prosecutor.
the
defendant
was
removed
from
the
court
during
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
trial
judge
ruled.
he
was
absent
during
a
part
of
the
opening
only
because
of
his
own
disorderly
conduct.
it
does
not
lie
in
his
mouth
to
complain
of
an
order
which
was
made
necessary
by
his
own
misconduct.
now,
101
years
later
people
in
the
state
of
illinois
asked
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
illinois
v.
allen.
allen
was
indicted
for
armed
robbery
in
1956,
tried
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
illinois
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
10
to
30
years
in
the
penitentiary.
he
is
presently
on
parole
and
i
am
informed
that
parole
--
from
beginning
of
the
trial,
allen
insisted
on
his
right
to
question
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
examination,
embarked
on
deliberate
and
knowing
course
of
disruption
outburst
and
threats
which
finally
culminated
in
his
removal
from
the
courtroom
during
most
of
the
presentation
of
a
states'
case.
we
contend
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
present
your
honor
for
the
entire
defense.
in
fact,
relative
calm
was
to
obtain
when
the
defense
began
its
presentation.
he
was
left;
he
was
taken
out
during
the
voir
dire
examination
which
he
was
conducting.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
not
there
for
the
opening.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
not
of
the
states'
case.
he
was
given
opportunity
to
come
back
immediately
after
and
before
the
voir
dire,
and
immediately
before
the
presentation
of
the
states'
case.
invitation
was
extended
by
the
trial
judge
through
counsel
to
have
him
return.
the
dialog
upon
his
return
was
such
that
it
clearly
informed
the
trial
judges.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
was.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
throughout
the
entire
states'
case.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
did.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
did,
your
honor
i
would
draw
that
i'm
not
sure
if
he
chose
to
be
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
there
is.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
by
both.
the
reason
we
contend
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
is
that
pleading
of
the
court
of
appeals
even
in
its
majority
opinion
as
well
as
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
the
dissent
of
seventh
circuit
and
the
opinion
--
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
clearly
on
agreement
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct
here.
of
the
10
reviewing
judges
who
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
record
all
10
agreed
on
the
conduct
only
two
felt
constrained
by
the
constitutional
prohibition
as
they
read
it
to
rule
that
allen
was
unlawfully
removed
from
his
trial.
just
briefly,
the
respondent
threatened
the
life
of
the
trial
judge,
ripped
his
attorney's
file
and
arranged
the
court
in
such
a
way
that
the
judge
felt
his
removal
was
necessary.
i
might
add
that
there
was
a
warning
in
all
of
these
cases.
some
of
the
commentators
on
this
area
have
suggested
that
if
this
rule
of
exclusion
is
allowed
that
it
be
appropriately
done
in
areas
where
there
are
warning.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
majority
opinion
found
adequate
warning
by
the
trial
judge
and
i
suggest
there
is
more
than
one
warning
included
in
the
administrators
from
the
trial
court
for
the
respondent
to
remain
silent.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
the
trial
took
approximately
two-and-a
half
days.
it
was
a
jury
trial;
it
was
a
simple
case
of
an
armed
robbery
of
a
tavern.
allen
was
identified
by
the
bartender
and
in
turn
allen
identified
the
victim.
the
defense
was
insanity
in
--
the
year-and-a-half
before
the
defendant
had
been
declared
incompetent.
he
had
been
restored
and
his
defense
from
sanity
was
rejected
by
the
trier
of
fact.
we
are
here
today
because
we
feel,
we
have
asked
this
court
to
review
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
compels
the
result
which
the
seventh
circuit
reluctantly
i
might
add
arrived
at.
we
feel
that
the
right
of
confrontation
through
its
birth
in
the
common
law,
certainly
and
its
adoption
by
the
sixth
amendment
wasn't
meant
to
broaden
the
exceptions
that
the
common
law
recognizes.
and
this
court
in
1926
in
salinger
versus
united
states
specifically
mentioned
that
while
the
common
law
was
brought
into
the
purview
of
the
sixth
amendment's
right
to
confrontation
it
certainly
wasn't
meant
to
make
the
exceptions
not
included
in
that
new
amendment.
this
court
had
in
diaz
versus
the
united
states
in
1912
clearly
addressed
itself
to
the
issue
of
waiver.
now,
in
that
case
the
murder
case
out
of
the
philippines
tried
on
the
philippine
code,
the
court
concluded
that
what
they
were
reviewing
was
a
substantial
equivalent
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
court
--
the
issue
in
diaz
as
presented
or
the
claim
made
was
that
the
supreme
court
--
in
the
supreme
court
here
that
he
did
not
waive
the
right
of
confrontation
but
that
he
could
not
waive
it.
this
court
held
that
waiver
was
possible,
was
permissible
and
did
obtain
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
defendant
voluntarily
left.
the
court
sent
a
message
to
the
presiding
judge
that
he
wouldn't
return.
significant,
we
feel
in
this
case
are
two
things.
one,
the
davis
case
which
the
only
direct
american
president
other
than
the
prior
illinois
case
in
1956.
on
this
point
was
mentioned
in
davis
favorably
--
in
diaz
favorably
and
what
is
significant
is
that
diaz
they're
residing
davis
which
was
an
involuntary
removal
case.
we
feel
that
if
waiver
is
recognized,
certainly
the
waiver
by
an
escapee
from
a
courtroom
that
the
unruly
defendant
is
not
be
accorded
treatment
different
in
the
escapee.
diaz
makes
it
clear
that
a
defendant
walks
out
or
escapes,
waives
his
right
to
be
present
as
the
trial
can
continue.
we
believe
there's
no
difference
between
a
defendant
who
walks
out
of
the
courtroom
and
a
defendant
who
was
ordered
to
move
because
his
courtroom
conduct
makes
a
fair
and
orderly
trial
impossible.
if
there's
waiver
in
the
prior
case
--
the
former
case,
we
think
there's
waiver
in
a
latter.
now,
on
the
issue
of
whether
waiver
has
been
recognized
our
research
indicates
only
the
davis
case
in
1869,
two
english
cases,
one
a
felony
case,
one
is
misdemeanor
case,
rex
v.
brown
and
rex
v.
berry,
also
in
the
19th
century.
but
it's
been
never
rejected
by
court
of
review
as
we
confine.
further,
we
suggest
that
this
court
in
dictum
in
the
diaz
case
in
a
subsequent
case
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
has
adopted
the
waiver
principal
and
that
the
dictum
allows
for
its
application
here.
i
might
add
that
in
dictum,
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
the
capital
case
involving
whether
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
view
the
scene
when
the
jury
left
to
do
that.
mr.
justice
cardozo
specifically
added
--
no
doubt,
the
privilege
of
confrontation
may
be
lost
by
consent
or
even
at
times
by
misconduct.
so,
in
the
schneider
versus
massachusetts
case
that
wasn't
an
issue
when
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
your
honor
we
have
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did.
yes
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
think
in
--
if
i
might
disagree
to
an
extent
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
feel
waiver
is
applicable
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
the
dialogue
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
one
of
not
a
lack
of
communication.
they
seem
to
be
understanding,
the
warning
seem
to
be
clear.
certainly
when
one
reads
the
record
in
this
case,
the
defendant
had
no
problem
in
making
his
intentions
known.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
they
set
a
patient
and
very
tolerant
judge.
i
think
that
when
the
dialog
reaches
the
level
it
did
in
this
case
where
the
inclusions
of
the
warnings,
which
might
result
if
in
fact
the
conduct
does
not
cease
that
waiver
would
not
be
stretching
the
concept
to
apply
it
here.
i
think
it
would
also
lend
to
a
more
flexible
rule
of
discretion
and
if
i
might
suggest
a
more
easy
handle
for
courts
below,
if
this
court
so
ruled
that
waiver
was
permissible
in
this
instance.
we
find
that
the
commentators
while
acknowledging
limited
authority
on
the
case
seem
to
be
pretty
much
unanimous
in
their
feeling
at
least
to
the
visceral
one
that
removal
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
we
in
our
study
found
that
the
development
of
the
right
to
be
present
was
early
cast
in
jurisdictional
terms
and
we
suggest
that
if
it
has
any
vitality
today
it
may
only
be
perhaps
in
capital
cases
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
one
of
the
remedies
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
suggest
that
we
just
broaden
the
trial
judge's
discretion
to
include
this
as
one
along
with
content
and
what
apparently
has
been
permitted
by
lower
court's
binding
and
gagging.
our
feeling
is
that
it
doesn't
fall
outside
binding
and
gagging.
in
fact,
it's
a
much
more
reasonable
and
much
more
desirable
end
for
justice
to
have
the
exclusion
when
it's
positive
under
the
case
like
this.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
that
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
i
will.
we
feel
that
there
is
--
the
policy
reasons
toward
adopting
the
exclusion
over
other
forms
are
one,
contempt
may
not
really
satisfy
the
situation.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
man
faced
to
the
possible
life
sentence.
our
feeling
is
that
contempt
in
cases
like
that
may
not
live
level
well
with
a
defendant
bent
on
disrupting
the
trial.
we
feel
the
scene
of
binding
and
gagging
and
i
question
whether
the
right
of
confrontation
is
any
better
preserved
by
the
defendant
found
gagging
and
maniacal.
it
brings
the
service
to
the
court
that
in
which
this
action
takes
place.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
justice
black,
in
this
case
below,
the
defendant
at
the
outset
announced
his
unwillingness
really
to
participate
in
the
trial
processing.
he
informs
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that
he
would
not
participate
in
the
trial.
not
in
a
voluntary
passion.
he
informed
the
court,
“you
have
a
right
to
restrain
me,
but
you
haven't
got
the
right
to
remove
me
and
you're
not
going
to
remove
me.”
and
that
the
court
replied,
we
will
determine
that.
the
defendant,
“no
you're
not,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
trial,
i'm
going
to
sit
here
and
you're
going
to
talk
and
you
can
bring
out
your
shackles
and
straight
jacket
and
put
them
on
me
and
take
my
mouth
but
it
will
do
no
good
because
there's
going
to
be
no
trial.”
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
he
did,
prior
to
noon
recess,
--
another
time
i
mean
to
stress
very
strongly
your
honors
how
tolerant
this
trial
judge
was.
the
defendant
announced
that
the
judge
would
be
a
corps
upon
his
return
--
defense
return
from
the
lunch
time
--
lunch
recess.
there
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
he
was
in
custody
your
honor.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
the
record
is
vague
but
there
is
some
indication
that
when
this
defendant
left
the
courtroom
and
went
to
the
anteroom
he
intended
to
be
a
little
physical
with
the
property
in
the
lock
up.
so,
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
yes
it
is.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
i
do
not,
i
think
it's
a
lesser
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
a
milder
form
of
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no,
i
understand.
but
when
you
said
it's
on
the
same
level
i
--
we
might
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
(inaudible)
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yeah,
well
i
think
the
exclusion
is
much
more
preferable
remedy
to
that
and
a
much
milder.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
our
view
that
it
would
the
shackling
and
gagging
what
it's
brought
with
is
the
parallel
prejudice
to
the
existing
procedure
in
addition
to
disruptive
conduct
that
may
be
taking
place
by
the
defendant's
actions.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice
it
preceded
that
because
in
pretrial
before
another
judge
of
the
cook
county
circuit
court
where
he
made
a
motion
for
a
change
of
judges
--
substitution
judges
we
thought
is
based
on
prejudice.
he
again
there
caused
some
sort
of
a
scene
and
we
--
so
you
can
trace
it
back
there.
but,
yes
this
started
immediately
and
we
suggest
upon
no
propagation.
there's
an
absence
totally
of
any
dialog
for
example
between
a
prosecutor
and
the
defendant.
so,
there's
no
act
of
--
to
state
apart
from
the
judge
in
incurring
the
raft
of
the
defendant
by
any
spoken
word
in
the
opening
statement
or
the
like.
your
honors,
we
would
add
one
other
fact
and
that
is
that
we
recognized
in
whenever
asking
this
court
to
acknowledge
broader
jurisdiction
discretion
and
a
trial
judge
--
that's
a
weighty
problem.
however,
if
the
police
of
this
country
can
be
entrusted
with
stock
and
first
discretion
which
we
suggest
is
a
low
visibility
situation.
certainly,
the
entrusting
to
a
trial
judge
subject
to
appropriate
review
of
the
opportunity
to
expel
and
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
our
position
is
this,
that
we
recognize
we're
asking
for
the
recognition
of
a
broad
discretion
in
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
and
recognizing
that
in
any
discretion
case,
there's
a
chance
that
the
review
is
always
difficult
because
of
the
area
of
discretion
and
is
quite
often
intruded
by
court
of
appeals
in
very
limited
fashion
entrusting
great
beliefs
that
a
trial
judge
normally
acts
very
fairly.
we
say
this
is
not
a
low
visibility
situation.
we're
trying
to
lay
any
fear
in
that
regard
that
this
will
not
become
a
wholesale
tool
of
a
judge
annoyed
with
the
look,
smart
talk
of
a
defendant.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
on
that
specific
point
mr.
justice
stewart
i
would
agree.
however,
on
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right,
constitutional
right
commentators
in
this
court
have
recognized
is
mainly
to
ensure
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination
and
it's
a
collateral
benefit
of
that,
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses.
certainly,
exclusion
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
true
but
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
stewart
in
barber
and
page
the
last
sixth
amendment
case,
not
at
all
on
point
but
written
by
this
court
in
'68.
the
first
to
stress
that
i
don't
mean
to
exclude
that
the
third
but
--
in
more
field
that
first
to
it
are
the
greater.
in
this
case,
the
counsel
continued
with
the
cross-examination
--
there
wasn't
that
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
and
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
certainly
remained
a
possibility
because
none
of
them
were
excluded.
it
seems
to
us
that
he
reach
a
point
and
that
constitutional
right,
you
cannot
have
both
--
you
can't
be
entitled
the
both,
the
right
and
a
ruin
of
it.
and
it
seems
that
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
the
ruin
of
it,
and
it
seems
here
that
we
have
a
case
where
defendant
is
bent
on
and
clearly
by
his
statements
so
destroying
any
right.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
exactly.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
feel
mr.
chief
justice
that's
at
least
one
of
three
clear
indications
that
he
--
when
brought
back
and
insisted
that
there
would
be
no
trial
in
two
of
the
returns
where
the
invitation
of
the
judge
that
you
have
a
record
that
seems
to
me
patently
clear
in
an
attempt
by
the
judge
to
bring
the
defendant
around
to
reasonable
conduct
and
a
clearing
decision
by
the
defendant
to
in
no
way
entertain
it
until
and
this
is
significant
until
the
defense
began
and
then
there
was
calm.
in
fact,
we
found
the
defendant
stating
in
affect
that
he
realized
that
his
conduct
was
improper.
it
can
also
stand
as
a
certain
reflective
process
that
he
probably
had
throughout
the
trial
but
just
chose
to
use
in
one
case
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
find
at
least
three
and
perhaps
four
--
for
the
fourth
one,
mr.
chief
justice
has
to
be
a
reading
into
statements.
it
does
include
the
word,
“warn.”
court
of
appeal's
majority
opinion
in
reversing
concluded
that
he
was
warned
and
did
not
spell
it
up.
but
they
found
as
well
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
a
warning
encompassed
in
the
dialog
between
the
judges.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
this
man
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
right,
he
is
on
parole.
and
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
he
would
be
no
longer
subject
to
any
of
the
vital
consequences
that
stem
from
a
pro-violator
and
he
has
year
or
so
or
more
to
go.
so
we
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor,
we
feel
that
he
can
either
try
a
contempt
citation
or
he
has
to
bind
and
gag
him
and
in
this
--
in
my
jurisdiction
and
in
my
city
we
had
the
unsightly
scene
of
a
bound
and
gag
defendant
recently
with
the
federal
marshall
placing
his
hands
in
front
of
the
gag
so
that
no
words
would
come
forward
through
the
gag.
now
-
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
i
do,
i'm
familiar
with
that
case.
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
it's
our
view
that
not
only
must
justice
be
done
but
there
ought
to
be
the
appearance
of
justice
and
if
i
might
in
that
assumption,
we
do
a
tremendous
disservice
to
promoting
that
kind
of
a
scene
and
in
the
rewarding
conduct
which
in
no
way
one
can
sympathize
with.
if
we
have
got
an
incompetent
defendant
then
he
shouldn't
be
on
trial.
but
certainly
one
which
is
a
pure
deliberate
act
of
volition
as
it
was
in
this
case,
it's
very
hard
to
not
find
that
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
right
have
been
exhausted.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
acknowledge
in
the
stricter
sense
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
was
a
classic
denial
--
if
the
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation
presupposes
never
removing
a
defendant
from
the
view
of
the
actual
trial
scene
and
we
acknowledge
that.
what
i
was
suggesting
perhaps
not
too
clearly
was
that
of
the
--
what
commentators
have
suggested
are
meaningful
benefits
of
the
right
of
confrontation.
we're
not
totally
denied
when
he
had
counsel
continuing
to
go
forward
with
the
cross-examination.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that
he
waived
it.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes,
it
was
violent.
the
removal
is
a
technical
violation,
if
one
can
call
up
into
play
the
word
“violation”
if
you
buy
our
waiver.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
it
would
have
been
a
violation.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is
mr
chief
justice
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
that's
correct,
i
would
imagine
that
i've
been
opposing
simply
because
as
a
trial,
i'm
used
to
the
waiver
of
the
signed
paper,
of
the
jury
waiver
or
whatever
but
you're
absolutely
correct.
they
did
not
call
it
direct
waiver
as
much
as
they
did
by
interpreting
it
from
the
conduct
(voice
overlaps)
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
not
a
forfeiture.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yeah,
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
there
is
right
of
the
state
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
we
feel
that
the
right
of
the
state
cannot
be
denied
to
the
trial
and
to
acknowledge
his
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
we
feel
he
does
not
lie
within
his
kin
to
make
that
ultimate
decision.
i
think
he
didn't
--
i
think
he
did
not
want
to
be
tried
or
he
certainly
he
didn't
want
or
perhaps
i
might
suggest
mr.
justice
black
that
maybe
he
did
want
to
be
tried
but
in
furtherance
of
his
particular
defense,
this
kind
of
disrupted
conduct
may
have
been
very
calculated.
that's
just
our
position
of
course
in
(voice
overlaps).
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
it
is.
those
are
his
statements,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
well,
i
just
suggested
that
our
theory
be
labeled
waiver,
we
felt
because
it's
one
that
we
think
is
very
workable
if
in
--
by
that
i
mean
the
trial
judge
reasonably
interpreting
conduct
can
find
a
waiver
in
a
situation
like
that.
that's
why
we
have
leaned
toward
the
waiver
conducts
also
because
as
our
reading
of
the
dictum
of
cases
that
could
preferably
dealt
with
waiver
in
this
court
that
words
like
--
that
he
can
waive
it
by
his
misconduct
as
mr.
justice
cardozo
said,
suggest
to
us
that
was
the
route
that
we
might
appropriately
offer
up
to
this
--
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
technically
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
as
if
he
would,
that's
true.
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
yes
sir.
perhaps
we
should
have
practiced
our
claims
of
waiver
as
effective
as
a
waiver.
we
just
felt,
it
would
not
be
misleading
to
offer
up
to
this
court
the
concept
nakedly
as
waiver
and
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
one
of
the
application
if
accepted
by
the
court.
i
wonder
if
i
might
reserve
a
minute
or
two
for
reply?
mr.
joel
m.
flaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
on
the
two
main
cases
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
writing
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts,
mr.
justice
cardozo
stated
hopt
v.
utah
has
been
distinguished
and
limited
and
what
was
said
in
hopt
v.
utah
under
subject
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant
was
dictum
and
no
more,
we
may
say
the
same
of
lewis
versus
the
united
states
and
if
i
might
state
the
second
on
the
state
of
the
record
mr.
kelly
who
was
counsel
for
the
defendant
below
was
appointed
on
october
14th
the
next
proceedings
were
december
11
in
the
case.
he
was
granted
the
right
to
be
co-counsel
in
his
case.
it
was
only
when
he
was
disrupted
during
the
voir
dire
that
the
judge
asked
that
he
let
his
counsel
take
over
and
that's
when
first
right
ensued,
and
leave
the
court
with
justice
stewart.
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
can
be
sustained
only
by
the
most
slavish
reading
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse.
