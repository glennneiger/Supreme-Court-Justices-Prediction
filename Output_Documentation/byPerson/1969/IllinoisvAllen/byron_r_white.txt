justice

he
was

did

cross-examine

what
is
the

justice

by

side
and
--
justice
byron

white
well,
mr.
flaum
i
gather
when
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
they
equated
it
to
it,
and
when
you
equate
something
to
something
--
it's
not
the
something,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
technically,
actually.
well,
all
you're
saying,
when
you
say
it's
equated
the
waiver
is
that
you
arrive
at
the
same
result
as
if
he
would.
justice

mr.
harris,
are
you
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
the
confrontation
clause,
there
are
no
circumstances
under
which
and
if
defendant
may
be
removed
from
the
courtroom
for
misconduct
and
the
trial
proceed
without
him.
are
you
going
that
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
alternatives?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
other?
do
you
suggest
the
gagging
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
gagging?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
certainly
you
don't
contest
the
very
premise
all
of
the
gag
which
is
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
try
in
the
key,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
very
premise
of
at
least
are
just
safeguards
about
the
accused
to
see
that
he
gets
the
kind
of
trial
that
the
constitution
guarantees?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly,
he
has
to
recognize
the
government's
right
to
trial,
doesn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
that
suggest
that
he
may
then
by
his
misconduct
that
he
prevents
the
government
from
trying
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
may
by
that
misconduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
you
have
a
number
of
defendants
who
are
equally
abstract
with
your
thought
would
be
that
each
should
have
to
have
his
own
cubicle,
state
would
have
to
provide
--
what
is
that?
