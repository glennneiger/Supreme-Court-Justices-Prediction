justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
removal
is
the
remedy
or
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
out
on
bail
or
he
is
in
custody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
slightly
of
(inaudible),
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
was
saying.
isn't
it
your
position
just
to
say
that
in
the
courtroom
could
be
a
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i'm
still
in
fact,
you
don't
have
to
argue
that
this
is
better
than
shack
(ph)
v.
williams.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
on
the
same
level,
it's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
have
to
win
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
saying
that
second
circuit
case
which
we
will
be
shackling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
reading
of
the
opinion
and
judgment
with
the
court
of
appeals,
this
man
is
free,
is
that
right?
i
don't
see
anything
about
right
on
illinois
to
try
him
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
legally
free
not
illegally
as
he
is
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
and
this
same
matter
comes
up
tomorrow
in
cook
county,
how
would
--
could
the
judge
legally
handle
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
second
circuit
we
didn't
have
that
problem.
when
he
would
gag
he
would
gag.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
him
(voice
overlaps).
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
allen
realize
what
he
was
saying
when
he
said,
“you're
not
going
to
hold
any
trial
(inaudible)?"
you
have
been
talking
about
what
the
judge
didn't
understand
but
i
mean
--
do
you
say
allen
didn't
mean
that
when
he
said
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
should
the
court
do
then?
let
him
break
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
judge
did
do
have
been?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
judge
to
do
then?
let
him
conduct
the
trial
the
way
he
wanted
to
conduct
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
know
he
was
going
to
carry
on
like
that
at
the
beginning,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
got
in
the
courtroom
--
in
the
mean
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he
have
known
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
was
before
the
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlaps)
do
you
have
any
reasons
form
to
know
that?
nobody
raised
it.
did
the
lawyer
raise
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
raised
by
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
was
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i'm
saying
at
that
stage,
what
should
the
judge
do
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
go
in
and
ask
the
defendant,
“how
do
you
want
me
to
run
the
trial?
is
that
what
you
want?"
in
that
situation,
the
judge
had
a
choice
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
three
things
and
he
chose
one
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
already
talked
of
binding
and
gagging?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
still
a
choice
made
by
allen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
choice
he
made
that
judge
says,
“you
need
to
keep
quiet
or
get
out"
and
he
didn't
keep
quiet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
the
court
does
by
saying
you're
going
to
be
at
corps
on
lunch
time,
is
that
protest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
new
york
case,
ben
vento
(ph)
picked
up
an
old
chair
and
told
him
and
mentioned
the
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
is
put
in
a
separate
room
or
in
the
chamber
and
we
find
at
the
end
of
the
trial
that
the
telephone
which
sometimes
happen,
is
that
all
in
15
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
have
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
didn't
do
it,
does
he
have
to
have
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
have
is
right
of
confrontation
for
15
minutes
i
understand
that's
your
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
times
does
this
man
had
been
convicted?
three
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
old
was
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
wondering
about
why
he
needs
all
these
fatherly
discussion.
he
is
quite
a
mature
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
don't
understand
is
under
your
theory
every
other
person
in
that
courtroom
has
to
act
with
demeanor
in
respect
for
the
court
except
the
defendant.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
what
he
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
your
point
is
it
is
why
he
wants
to
be
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
idea
of
confrontation,
he
is
there
bound
and
gagged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
difference
between
him
sleeping
outside
and
sleeping
inside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
had
four
chances
to
change
his
mind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
removal
is
the
remedy
or
one?
justice
thurgood
