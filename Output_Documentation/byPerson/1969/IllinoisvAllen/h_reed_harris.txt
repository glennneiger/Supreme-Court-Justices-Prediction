mr.
h.
reed
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
believe
they
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
effects
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
feel
that
they
need
some
elaboration
--
so
that
the
court
can
more
accurately
understand
the
situation
of
this
trial.
the
respondent
william
allen
on
august
12,
1956
at
about
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
walked
into
a
tavern,
went
to
a
corner
of
the
bar
where
no
one
was
around
and
when
the
bartender
came
over
to
ask
him
what
he
wanted
to
drink,
the
bartender
saw
a
gun
--
allen
said,
“i
want
the
money,”
the
bartender
took
the
money
and
gave
it
to
him
and
allen
left.
a
few
hours
later
allen
was
apprehended.
he
was
searched,
no
gun,
but
approximately
$200.00
was
found
in
his
presence.
the
officer
said,
“where
did
you
get
the
money?”
and
allen
said,
“oh
i
robbed
this
bar
this
evening.”
with
that,
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
subsequently
there
was
a
line
up.
when
allen
was
walked
in
with
several
other
suspects
to
be
viewed
by
the
owner
of
the
bar
and
the
bartender
both
of
whom
were
in
the
bar
when
the
robbery
occurred
before
he
could
be
identified,
allen
said,
“hey,
i
recognize
you,
you
look
familiar,
didn't
i
rob
you
this
night?”
last
night?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
i'm
trying
to
explain
allen's
behavior.
allen
was
then
indicted
and
while
in
jail,
there
were
several
attempted
suicides.
allen
had
a
prior
mental
history
back
in
the
early
50's
--
he
was
committed
and
served
some
time
in
a
mental
hospital.
subsequently,
a
pretrial
sanity
hearing
was
held
in
1956,
it
was
determined
that
he
could
not
cooperate
with
his
attorney
and
he
was
sentenced
to
a
mental
institution.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
i
have
not
raised
but
it
bears
to
--
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
realize
the
type
of
person
who
allen
was
and
what
the
trial
judge
was
confronted
with.
i
don't
feel
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
warnings
realized
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
a
prior
mental
history
and
may
not
--
although
the
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
may
not
have
been
in
full
control
of
his
faculties
at
the
time
he
was
tried.
and
the
fact
that
you
may
say
to
someone,
if
you
don't
sit-down
and
be
quiet
you're
going
to
be
removed
and
warn
him
once
or
twice
and
he
continues
to
disrupt
the
proceedings
and
to
remove
that
person
--
that's
different
than
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
complete
control
of
his
faculties
who
may
realize
what
the
court
is
saying.
when
allen
was
subsequently
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
he
did
mean
that.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
did
mean
that
because
he
wanted
to
conduct
his
own
trial.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
no.
because,
when
allen
was
brought
to
trial,
he
requested
the
right
to
represent
himself
and
the
court
granted
him
that
right.
he
began
to
conduct
a
voir
dire
examination
and
during
the
conduct
of
that
examination
--
after
some
14
pages
of
transcript
of
examining
the
first
witness,
he
began
to
make
statements
about
his
case.
the
state
objected.
there
then
became
a
dialog
between
allen
and
the
judge.
the
judge
warned
him
not
to
make
statements,
conduct
himself
only
to
the
qualifications
of
the
jurors.
the
dialog
continued,
allen
said
he
was
going
to
conduct
this
trial
as
he
knew
how
the
judge
warned
him,
any
statements
and
i'm
going
to
deny
you
the
right
to
represent
yourself.
some
more
dialog,
allen
continued
to
be
disrespectful
to
the
court
because
he
wanted
to
conduct
his
defense
the
only
way
he
knew
how.
he
is
not
a
skilled
attorney,
he
is
an
indigent
who
was
on
trial
for
his
life
but
this
time
he
said
life
and
the
judge
said
liberty.
but
the
issue
involved
is
because
allen
at
this
time
was
a
three
time
loser.
this
was
his
fourth
conviction.
and
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
sentenced
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
in
the
penitentiary
and
this
may
explain
that
the
court
be
the
dialogue
between
the
judge
and
allen
with
respect
to
life
and
liberty
but
the
court
was
arguing
him.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
if
he
did
not,
if
the
judge
felt
that
allen
had
the
competence
to
conduct
the
trial
in
the
beginning
he
should
have
let
him
proceed.
if
he
felt
that
he
did
not
have
the
competence
but
he
began
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
then
you
don't
begin
a
dialogue
for
two
minutes
and
say,
“now,
do
it
right,
do
it
the
way
it
should
be
done
or
i'm
going
to
deny
that
right.
why
don't
you
have
a
recess,
why
not
go
into
the
chambers,
why
not
sit
down
with
the
man?"
if
the
judge
knew
that
he
had
a
prior
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
but
the
judge
realized
this
before
he
gave
him
the
right.
he
should
have
known
that
a
person
he
was
dealing
with
and
if
he
is
going
to
give
that
person
the
right
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
his
record
was
before
him.
the
judge
had
--
i
presume
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
the
judge
knew
of
his
prior
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital
because
the
defendant
made
a
request
to
the
court
that
he
wanted
an
order
from
a
prior
judge.
this
order
was
a
commitment
of
him
to
a
mental
institution
several
years
ago.
i'm
sure
that
the
trial
judge
must
have
known
that
this
man
was
just
restored
to
sanity
after
being
committed
only
a
years
ago.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
lawyer
but
when
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
by
allen?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
only
with
respect
to
a
--
reference
to
a
order
from
a
previous
judge
as
to
his
commitment.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
was
during
this
dialogue
between
the
courts.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
should
recess
the
court,
sit-down
with
the
defendant
in
chambers,
take
five
minutes
out
and
explain
to
him
very
simply
in
a
calm
passion
rather
than
an
argumentative
passion
and
say,
“here's
what's
going
to
happen."
i
mean
they
conducted
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
there
were
two
rights
which
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
no.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon
me.
there
were
two
elements,
first
was,
denial
of
allen's
right
to
represent
himself.
this
was
denied
first.
this
is
what
brought
about
the
second
confrontation
between
allen
and
the
court
because
allen
objected
that
he
is
not
being
permitted
to
continue
to
represent
himself.
the
court
had
appointed
an
attorney
that
day
to
sit
with
him
to
protect
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
allen
and
this
attorney
had
any
discussions
about
his
case
whatsoever.
allen
did
not
want
him.
he
refused
to
accept
him,
but
the
judge
said,
“you
sit
down,
he
is
going
to
conduct
your
defense."
he
said,
“no,
he
is
not.
i
don't
want
him."
the
judge
says,
“you
sit
down
and
be
quiet
or
else
i'm
going
to
have
you
removed."
allen
refused
to
sit
and
be
quiet.
he
didn't
want
the
attorney
who
was
being
appointed.
the
judge
says,
“remove
him"
and
he
was
taken
out
of
court.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
has
a
choice,
after
he
has
given
the
right
to
defend
himself
and
that
right
and
is
now
denied,
just
sits
still
and
sit
in
a
chair
and
have
an
attorney
who
he
doesn't
know
represent
himself,
have
an
attorney
who
he
hasn't
talked
to
or
who
may
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
case.
is
he
to
just
sit
there
or
is
he
permitted
to
protest
when
he
thinks
our
violation
of
his
rights.
and
at
this
point
in
time
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
allen
was
in
custody,
i
am
sure
that
this
is
something
that
was
said
in
the
heat
of
the
dispute
between
the
court
and
allen
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
judge
took
that
seriously.
of
course
the
judge
was
a
form
of
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes
he
did,
but
that
was
after
the
trial
had
commenced.
in
allen,
it
was
a
logical
growth
from
his
being
denied
his
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
am
going
that
far
because
i
believe
that
under
today's
technological
advances
there
are
alternatives
for
dealing
with
the
unruly
defendant
which
will
preserve
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses.
i
do
not
believe
that
an
attorney
without
his
client
to
communicate
with
him
is
capable
of
properly
conducting
a
cross-examination.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
alternatives
are
a
glass
sound
proof
booth
which
could
be
constructed.
such
a
booth
was
actually
used
during
a
sanity
hearing
in
1956
in
california,
and
i
have
in
my
possession
photographs
of
that
booth.
the
defendant,
the
state
of
california
built
a
booth
which
was
12
by
12,
that
was
sound
proof
glass,
it
was
air
conditioned,
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
booth.
in
the
booth
was
a
guard
with
the
defendant.
when
the
defendant
first
got
in
the
booth
as
soon
as
the
hearing
began
he
picked
up
the
chair,
he
was
sitting
in
and
he
smashed
against
the
glass.
they
recessed
the
court
and
then
built
an
iron
chair
which
was
bolted
to
the
floor.
there
were
clamps
which
were
built
onto
that
chair
so
the
defendant
was
then
seated
in
the
chair
with
the
clamps
around
his
leg,
he
had
a
telephone
with
which
to
communicate
as
soon
as
his
attorney
who
was
sitting
just
outside
the
booth.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
propose
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
i'm
late
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no
it
wasn't.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
i
did
not
and
it
was
not
proposed
at
that
time.
but
this
is
a
possible
solution.
the
only
problem
with
this
solution
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
suggest
the
possibility
of
close
circuit
televising
the
trial
to
another
room
where
again
he
can
see
the
proceedings
and
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
feel
that
he
should
be
--
if
the
court
will
not
accept
close
circuit
television
or
a
booth
then
he
should
be
gagged,
he
should
remain
in
court
because
even
though
he's
gagged
and
he
can't
talk
to
his
attorney,
you
can
still
hear
what's
going
on.
and
it's
completely
different
for
a
defendant
to
be
in
court
and
to
hear
what's
going
on
so
at
a
recess
he
can
talk
to
his
attorney
rather
than
try
and
read
a
transcript
during
a
recess
and
tell
him
what
should
or
should
not
happen
or
should
be
set
in
cross-examination.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes.
and
i
also
believe
now
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
i
think
i
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
permit
or
the
court
should
permit
a
defendant
to
disrupt
the
trial,
to
cause
a
mistrial
to
delay
the
trial
by
conduct.
and
i
feel
that
his
right
to
be
in
court
is
mandatory
so
he
can
see
what
is
happening
and
confer
with
his
attorney.
if
he
attempts
to
purposely
disrupt
the
court,
i
do
not
think
that
a
contempt
sentence
is
going
to
be
effective
because
assuming
a
series
of
contempt
convictions
over
a
period
of
time
during
this
time
there
maybe
witnesses
who
could
testify,
who
will
now
no
longer
be
available
and
thereby
through
indirection
he
may
be
serving
three
or
four
contempt
terms
and
avoid
serving
a
much
more
serious
term
for
the
charges
that
are
brought
against
them.
i
think
that
there
are
more
effective
ways
of
gagging
and
binding
a
defendant
rather
the
one
which
was
used
in
the
recent
trial
in
chicago
where
the
seven
defendants.
bobby
seals
was
chained
with
a
sort
of
a
make
shift
gag
on
his
mouth.
had
the
court
used
a
straight
jacket
and
the
hospital
gag
as
we
used
in
a
recent
ohio
trial.
the
defendant
would
have
been
immobile
and
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
bite
through
the
gag
and
other
noises
to
disrupt
the
proceedings.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
to
close
circuit
the
trial,
i
mean
a
cubicle
i
think
is
impractical
because
as
was
done
in
the
senate
hearing
in
california
when
the
defendant
got
in
the
cubicle
as
a
last
effort
to
disrupt
the
proceeding
--
he
then
pretended
to
be
asleep
during
the
entire
hearing
which
lasted
two
or
three
weeks.
i
think
the
close
circuit
television
could
be
--
it's
mobile,
it
could
be
setup
and
the
cost
is
nominal.
every
bank
and
savings
and
loan
association
and
the
basis
of
a
country
have
closed
circuit
tv
every
time
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
but
at
least
he
will
be
seen
the
witnesses
and
he
will
be
able
to
communicate
with
his
attorney
and
tell
him
how
to
cross-examine.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
that
depends
on
how
the
right
of
confrontation
is
defined.
he
is
to
confront
him
for
what
purpose?
i
think
the
purposes
were
there
one
so
the
--
he
can
face
the
witness,
the
defendant
and
cross-examine.
there
is
a
second
reason
for
the
jury
to
see
the
witness.
and
reflect
on
his
demeanor
and
his
testimony.
i
don't
think
either
of
these
rights
would
be
violated
if
he
is
placed
in
a
separate
room.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
if
the
phone
is
out
of
order
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
because
i
would
think
that
there
should
--
there
would
be
a
marshal
in
the
room
with
the
defendant
who
could
--
if
the
phone
is
out
of
order,
he
could
very
simply
communicate
by
a
runner
to
the
court
that
the
phone
is
not
working
and
let's
get
it
repaired
or
recess
for
10
or
15
minutes.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
he
would
still
have
the
opportunity
to
see
what
is
proceeding
if
the
phone
is
not
working
because
he
now
tries
the
phone
to
his
attorney,
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
minutes
for
him
--
for
a
runner
to
go
from
the
room
where
he's
watching
the
trial
to
the
court.
let's
say
the
phone
is
not
working,
that's
recess.
during
that
time
he
can
communicate
with
his
attorney
and
they
can
very
simply
go
over
what
he
was
unable
to
tell
him
on
the
telephone.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
the
court
still
has
a
responsibility
and
the
courts
do
have
a
responsibility
and
we
should
not
permit
certain
defendants
to
use
of
the
power
of
the
courts
and
dictate
to
them
what
or
what
is
not
going
to
happen.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
but
at
least
he
would
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
but
he
is
not
disrupting
the
orderly
process
of
the
trial
which
is
going
on.
he
would
not
be
disrupting
the
orderly
process
of
the
trial.
the
trial
would
proceed,
he
would
not
have
the
opportunity
to
disrupt
it
which
could
be
done
if
he
was
gagged
or
bound
in
court.
or
by
ranting
and
raving
because
the
question
then
becomes
at
what
point
in
time
does
a
trial
judge
say
to
a
defendant
who
is
objecting
certain
things
which
a
trial
judge
may
be
saying
that
he
has
now
waived
his
right
to
be
present.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
would
either
have
him
bound
and
gagged
or
i
would
build
a
glass
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
why
should
that
look
bad?
historically
this
right
has
been
--
defendant
has
always
been
bound
and
gagged,
if
he
tries
to
cause
a
disturbance.
and
the
court
is
almost
every
state
in
the
union.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
think
the
best
thing
is
the
closed
circuit
to
trial
too.
i
think
the
next
best
thing
would
be
the
close
circuit
television
of
the
trial
to
the
defendant.
remove
him
so
he
doesn't
disturb
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
okay,
if
you
can't
televise
the
trial,
if
you
can't
build
a
glass
booth,
then
bind
him
and
gag
him
and
keep
him
in
court.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
prison
reading
law
books
your
honor
and
he
relied
on
that
recent
illinois
supreme
court
decision,
the
decimian
(ph)
case
which
counsel
referred
to
where
a
defendant
did
cause
a
disruption
--
he
was
removed
from
the
courtroom
for
a
moment
and
at
which
time
the
attorneys
approached
the
bench.
they
discussed
with
the
court
that
this
might
be
a
violation
of
his
rights
at
which
time
he
was
brought
back
in.
his
conviction
was
subsequently
reversed
on
other
grounds
but
the
respondent
has
advised
me
that
he
had
read
that
case
and
he
realized
that
he
had
certain
rights
and
he
was
going
to
preserve
his
rights.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
think
the
court
had
the
right
to
do
that
but
the
problem
inherent
in
that
is
that
there
were
four
witnesses
against--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yeah
--
no,
i
don't
because
there
were
four
witnesses
against
the
respondent.
let's
say
he
goes
to
jail
for
six
months
for
contempt
of
the
court.
he
comes
out,
the
judge
says,
“can
you
stand
a
trial
again,"
he
says,
“no
i'm
not."
he's
back
in
jail
for
contempt.
he
is
in
jail
for
six
months.
meanwhile,
one
of
the
witnesses
now
moves
to
california,
one
dies,
one
become
sick
and
something
happens
to
the
other
one.
he
comes
back,
he
is
not
ready
to
stand
trial
your
honor
try
me
and
there's
no
more
witnesses.
so,
he
has
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
but
you
see
if
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
but
there
are
certain
circuits
in
where
witnesses
may
disappear,
they
may
die.
one
of
the
problems
inherent
in
this
case
--
this
case
would
be
retried
today.
i
believe
that
two
of
the
witnesses
have
died
and
one
has
subsequently
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
in
cook
county,
illinois.
so,
all
the
four
witnesses
against
him,
there
would
just
be
one
witness
who
can
possibly
testify.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
i
do.
but,
now
to
continue
on
with
what
happens
at
allen
is
that
once
the
trial
began
he
was
brought
in,
after
the
voir
dire
was
concluded.
the
judge
says,
“you
can
stay
here
if
you
remain
quiet."
he
was
non-committal
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do.
the
trial
began,
the
first
thing
that
was
done
is
that
his
court
appointed
attorney
made
a
motion
of
good
witnesses.
the
respondent
looked
around
he
didn't
see
his
friends
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
court.
his
sister
--
he
got
up
and
said,
“where's
my
witnesses?
how
can
this
trial
go
on?"
and
with
that
the
judge
ordered
him
removed
out
of
court.
he
was
in
court
four
times
the
next,
that
afternoon
which
was
during
the
prosecution's
entire
case.
there
were
four
witnesses.
two
testified
--
they
saw
him
commit
the
crime,
two
testified
that
he
admitted
to
him
that
he
committed
the
crime.
and
the
point
in
testimony
was
reached,
“do
you
see
the
man
who
did
that?"
and
the
witness
would
look
around
and
say,
“no,
i
don't"
and
the
judge
would
say,
“bring
in
the
defendant"
and
they
dragged
this
guy
in
with
handcuffs
in
a
prison
uniform
that
was
stenciled
across
the
front
maximum
security
and
they'd
say,
“that's
the
man."
and
then
they
say,
“remove
the
defendant,"
they
drag
him
out
again
four
times
in
and
out.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
sure,
keep
him
in
court,
but
don't
bring
him
in
and
out
of
the
court
every
time
you
want
to
identify
him.
i
mean,
even
in
the
most
primitive
of
identification
in
police
line
up,
they
just
don't
bring
one
person
out
and
say,
“is
that
the
man
who
did
it,"
they
at
least
bring
several
out.
here,
he
said,
“did
you
see
the
man
in
the
courtroom
when
you
look
around?"
there
are
several
faces,
“no
i
don't."
“okay,
bring
in
the
defendant."
one
guy
comes
in,
that's
the
man.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
in
the
reading
in
the
record,
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
court
appointed
attorney
for
him
did
an
excellent
job.
the
trial
judge
who
was
in
his
70's
who
may
have
had
certain
preconceived
notions
about
justice
because
he
was
a
former
prosecutor
for
many
years
as
a
first
instance
--
in
cook
county,
was
also
very
tolerant
with
this
defendant.
however,
i
felt
that
he
should
have
been
more
tolerant.
i
felt
that
once
this
dispute
began,
he
should
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
sit-down
with
this
defendant
and
explain
to
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
in
a
conversational
tone
in
chambers,
the
whole
thing
would
have
taken
five
minutes
and
not
in
the
heat
of
argument
where
the
defendant
may
not
be
paying
attention
on
what's
going
on
because
he
wants
to
preserve
his
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
was
convicted
three
times
and
i'm
advised
that
there
were
other
charges
against
him
which
he
was
never
prosecuted
on.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
when
he
was
convicted
--
he
is
38
now,
he
was
convicted
in
57,
he
was
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
--
well,
i
don't
i
--
it's
not
so
much
him,
it's
what
he
stands
for
which
is
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
tried
and
preserve
his
rights
and
protect
those
rights.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
think
that
the
defendant
also
has
to
conduct
himself
with
respect
but
you
can
exclude
a
spectator
from
the
courtroom
without
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant
but
i
believe
that
you
cannot
do
that
to
the
defendant
because
he
has
the
right
--
the
defendant
was
on
trial.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
regardless
of
what
he
does,
he
has
--
if
he
wants
to
go
to
sleep
during
the
trial,
that's
his
right.
but
if
he
demands
the
right
to
be
there,
don't
exclude
him
so
he
can't
see
what's
going
on.
and
if
he
tries
to
disrupt
the
proceedings,
don't
let
him
be
successful,
deal
with
him,
but
preserve
his
right
in
the
event
all
of
a
sudden
he
gets
a
change
of
heart
that
he
wants
to
know
what's
going
on.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
anytime
a
defendant
is
tried,
that's
all
the
court
really
knows
it,
that
is
there
because
you
have
no
knowledge
as
to
what
he
is
doing
in
his
mind
whether
he
is
thinking
about
the
baseball
game
that
may
be
going
on
next
week
or
something
else.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
the
defendant
sit
and
be
alert
and
pay
attention
to
the
trial
--
it
just
requires
that
he
be
there
so
he
has
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because,
if
he
changes
his
mind
that
he
wants
to
pay
attention
and
wants
to
defend
himself
he
can
then
do
it.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
no,
he
was
warned
once
about
conducting
his
trial
then
that
right
was
denied
him.
i
believe
he
was
just
warned
twice
about
his
being
removed
and
when
he
didn't
pay
attention
he
was
then
removed.
and
i
don't
think
those
warnings
were
sufficient.
this
is
actually
a
case
of
first
impression;
this
court
has
never
really
ruled
on
this
issue.
the
case
as
i
cite
--
the
hopt,
case,
the
shields
to
the
lewis
case
deal
with
examination
of
jurors
or
jury
instruction
outside
the
presence
of
the
defendant
and
these
cases
rely
on
due
process
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
diaz
case
came
out
of
the
philippines
which
although
the
philippine
government
act
had
a
similar
provision
as
the
right
of
confrontation
which
was
supposedly
based
on
the
sixth
amendment.
diaz
expressly
waived
his
right
to
be
present
during
the
trial.one
of
the
reason
it
was
because
the
trial
took
several
months
and
they
would
recess
for
30
or
60
days
and
he
has
lived
way
far
from
the
court
and
it
was
inconvenient
from
the
bean
(ph)
court
so
we
said,
"we'll
proceed
without
him,
there's
only
one
or
two
–
it's
just
going
to
be
heard,"
"my
attorney
will
be
there,
he
can
handle
it
for
me."
i
don't
believe
that
would,
what
mr.
justice
cardozo
said
in
schneider
is
applicable
because
that
was
a
case
involving
whether
a
defendant
had
the
right
to
go
to
a
view
of
a
scene
with
the
jury
under
massachusetts
law
that
right
did
not
exist
although
the
right
exists
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions.
mr.
justice
cardozo
was
in
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
at
this
time
the
certain
rights
out
of
the
sixth
amendment
first
time
have
been
said
that
and
incorporated
and
applied
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
sixth
amendment
historically
--
the
right
of
confrontation,
it's
not
clear
where
it
came
from.
some
people
say
that
some
commentators
say
it
comes
basically
from
the
evils
of
the
star
chamber
proceedings
in
england.
others
say
it
stems
from
the
injustice
which
happened
to
sir
walter
raleigh
who
was
tried
in
1603
for
treason.
this
in
effect
was
really
an
early
political
trial.
queen
elizabeth
had
died
and
her
successor,
i
believe
was
king
charles
wasn't
pleased
with
rollie.
rollie
had
caused
the
death
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
h.
reed
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
believe
they
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
effects
are
not
in
dispute
but
i
feel
that
they
need
some
elaboration
--
so
that
the
court
can
more
accurately
understand
the
situation
of
this
trial.
the
respondent
william
allen
on
august
12,
1956
at
about
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
walked
into
a
tavern,
went
to
a
corner
of
the
bar
where
no
one
was
around
and
when
the
bartender
came
over
to
ask
him
what
he
wanted
to
drink,
the
bartender
saw
a
gun
--
allen
said,
“i
want
the
money,”
the
bartender
took
the
money
and
gave
it
to
him
and
allen
left.
a
few
hours
later
allen
was
apprehended.
he
was
searched,
no
gun,
but
approximately
$200.00
was
found
in
his
presence.
the
officer
said,
“where
did
you
get
the
money?”
and
allen
said,
“oh
i
robbed
this
bar
this
evening.”
with
that,
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
subsequently
there
was
a
line
up.
when
allen
was
walked
in
with
several
other
suspects
to
be
viewed
by
the
owner
of
the
bar
and
the
bartender
both
of
whom
were
in
the
bar
when
the
robbery
occurred
before
he
could
be
identified,
allen
said,
“hey,
i
recognize
you,
you
look
familiar,
didn't
i
rob
you
this
night?”
last
night?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
i'm
trying
to
explain
allen's
behavior.
allen
was
then
indicted
and
while
in
jail,
there
were
several
attempted
suicides.
allen
had
a
prior
mental
history
back
in
the
early
50's
--
he
was
committed
and
served
some
time
in
a
mental
hospital.
subsequently,
a
pretrial
sanity
hearing
was
held
in
1956,
it
was
determined
that
he
could
not
cooperate
with
his
attorney
and
he
was
sentenced
to
a
mental
institution.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
i
have
not
raised
but
it
bears
to
--
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
realize
the
type
of
person
who
allen
was
and
what
the
trial
judge
was
confronted
with.
i
don't
feel
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
warnings
realized
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
a
prior
mental
history
and
may
not
--
although
the
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
may
not
have
been
in
full
control
of
his
faculties
at
the
time
he
was
tried.
and
the
fact
that
you
may
say
to
someone,
if
you
don't
sit-down
and
be
quiet
you're
going
to
be
removed
and
warn
him
once
or
twice
and
he
continues
to
disrupt
the
proceedings
and
to
remove
that
person
--
that's
different
than
dealing
with
a
person
who
has
complete
control
of
his
faculties
who
may
realize
what
the
court
is
saying.
when
allen
was
subsequently
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
he
did
mean
that.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
did
mean
that
because
he
wanted
to
conduct
his
own
trial.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
no.
because,
when
allen
was
brought
to
trial,
he
requested
the
right
to
represent
himself
and
the
court
granted
him
that
right.
he
began
to
conduct
a
voir
dire
examination
and
during
the
conduct
of
that
examination
--
after
some
14
pages
of
transcript
of
examining
the
first
witness,
he
began
to
make
statements
about
his
case.
the
state
objected.
there
then
became
a
dialog
between
allen
and
the
judge.
the
judge
warned
him
not
to
make
statements,
conduct
himself
only
to
the
qualifications
of
the
jurors.
the
dialog
continued,
allen
said
he
was
going
to
conduct
this
trial
as
he
knew
how
the
judge
warned
him,
any
statements
and
i'm
going
to
deny
you
the
right
to
represent
yourself.
some
more
dialog,
allen
continued
to
be
disrespectful
to
the
court
because
he
wanted
to
conduct
his
defense
the
only
way
he
knew
how.
he
is
not
a
skilled
attorney,
he
is
an
indigent
who
was
on
trial
for
his
life
but
this
time
he
said
life
and
the
judge
said
liberty.
but
the
issue
involved
is
because
allen
at
this
time
was
a
three
time
loser.
this
was
his
fourth
conviction.
and
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
sentenced
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
in
the
penitentiary
and
this
may
explain
that
the
court
be
the
dialogue
between
the
judge
and
allen
with
respect
to
life
and
liberty
but
the
court
was
arguing
him.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
if
he
did
not,
if
the
judge
felt
that
allen
had
the
competence
to
conduct
the
trial
in
the
beginning
he
should
have
let
him
proceed.
if
he
felt
that
he
did
not
have
the
competence
but
he
began
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
then
you
don't
begin
a
dialogue
for
two
minutes
and
say,
“now,
do
it
right,
do
it
the
way
it
should
be
done
or
i'm
going
to
deny
that
right.
why
don't
you
have
a
recess,
why
not
go
into
the
chambers,
why
not
sit
down
with
the
man?"
if
the
judge
knew
that
he
had
a
prior
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
but
the
judge
realized
this
before
he
gave
him
the
right.
he
should
have
known
that
a
person
he
was
dealing
with
and
if
he
is
going
to
give
that
person
the
right
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
his
record
was
before
him.
the
judge
had
--
i
presume
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
the
judge
knew
of
his
prior
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital
because
the
defendant
made
a
request
to
the
court
that
he
wanted
an
order
from
a
prior
judge.
this
order
was
a
commitment
of
him
to
a
mental
institution
several
years
ago.
i'm
sure
that
the
trial
judge
must
have
known
that
this
man
was
just
restored
to
sanity
after
being
committed
only
a
years
ago.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
lawyer
but
when
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
by
allen?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
only
with
respect
to
a
--
reference
to
a
order
from
a
previous
judge
as
to
his
commitment.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
was
during
this
dialogue
between
the
courts.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
should
recess
the
court,
sit-down
with
the
defendant
in
chambers,
take
five
minutes
out
and
explain
to
him
very
simply
in
a
calm
passion
rather
than
an
argumentative
passion
and
say,
“here's
what's
going
to
happen."
i
mean
they
conducted
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
there
were
two
rights
which
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
no.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon
me.
there
were
two
elements,
first
was,
denial
of
allen's
right
to
represent
himself.
this
was
denied
first.
this
is
what
brought
about
the
second
confrontation
between
allen
and
the
court
because
allen
objected
that
he
is
not
being
permitted
to
continue
to
represent
himself.
the
court
had
appointed
an
attorney
that
day
to
sit
with
him
to
protect
the
record.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
allen
and
this
attorney
had
any
discussions
about
his
case
whatsoever.
allen
did
not
want
him.
he
refused
to
accept
him,
but
the
judge
said,
“you
sit
down,
he
is
going
to
conduct
your
defense."
he
said,
“no,
he
is
not.
i
don't
want
him."
the
judge
says,
“you
sit
down
and
be
quiet
or
else
i'm
going
to
have
you
removed."
allen
refused
to
sit
and
be
quiet.
he
didn't
want
the
attorney
who
was
being
appointed.
the
judge
says,
“remove
him"
and
he
was
taken
out
of
court.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
has
a
choice,
after
he
has
given
the
right
to
defend
himself
and
that
right
and
is
now
denied,
just
sits
still
and
sit
in
a
chair
and
have
an
attorney
who
he
doesn't
know
represent
himself,
have
an
attorney
who
he
hasn't
talked
to
or
who
may
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
case.
is
he
to
just
sit
there
or
is
he
permitted
to
protest
when
he
thinks
our
violation
of
his
rights.
and
at
this
point
in
time
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
allen
was
in
custody,
i
am
sure
that
this
is
something
that
was
said
in
the
heat
of
the
dispute
between
the
court
and
allen
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
judge
took
that
seriously.
of
course
the
judge
was
a
form
of
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes
he
did,
but
that
was
after
the
trial
had
commenced.
in
allen,
it
was
a
logical
growth
from
his
being
denied
his
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
am
going
that
far
because
i
believe
that
under
today's
technological
advances
there
are
alternatives
for
dealing
with
the
unruly
defendant
which
will
preserve
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses.
i
do
not
believe
that
an
attorney
without
his
client
to
communicate
with
him
is
capable
of
properly
conducting
a
cross-examination.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
alternatives
are
a
glass
sound
proof
booth
which
could
be
constructed.
such
a
booth
was
actually
used
during
a
sanity
hearing
in
1956
in
california,
and
i
have
in
my
possession
photographs
of
that
booth.
the
defendant,
the
state
of
california
built
a
booth
which
was
12
by
12,
that
was
sound
proof
glass,
it
was
air
conditioned,
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
booth.
in
the
booth
was
a
guard
with
the
defendant.
when
the
defendant
first
got
in
the
booth
as
soon
as
the
hearing
began
he
picked
up
the
chair,
he
was
sitting
in
and
he
smashed
against
the
glass.
they
recessed
the
court
and
then
built
an
iron
chair
which
was
bolted
to
the
floor.
there
were
clamps
which
were
built
onto
that
chair
so
the
defendant
was
then
seated
in
the
chair
with
the
clamps
around
his
leg,
he
had
a
telephone
with
which
to
communicate
as
soon
as
his
attorney
who
was
sitting
just
outside
the
booth.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
propose
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
i'm
late
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no
it
wasn't.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
i
did
not
and
it
was
not
proposed
at
that
time.
but
this
is
a
possible
solution.
the
only
problem
with
this
solution
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
suggest
the
possibility
of
close
circuit
televising
the
trial
to
another
room
where
again
he
can
see
the
proceedings
and
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
feel
that
he
should
be
--
if
the
court
will
not
accept
close
circuit
television
or
a
booth
then
he
should
be
gagged,
he
should
remain
in
court
because
even
though
he's
gagged
and
he
can't
talk
to
his
attorney,
you
can
still
hear
what's
going
on.
and
it's
completely
different
for
a
defendant
to
be
in
court
and
to
hear
what's
going
on
so
at
a
recess
he
can
talk
to
his
attorney
rather
than
try
and
read
a
transcript
during
a
recess
and
tell
him
what
should
or
should
not
happen
or
should
be
set
in
cross-examination.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes.
and
i
also
believe
now
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
i
think
i
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
permit
or
the
court
should
permit
a
defendant
to
disrupt
the
trial,
to
cause
a
mistrial
to
delay
the
trial
by
conduct.
and
i
feel
that
his
right
to
be
in
court
is
mandatory
so
he
can
see
what
is
happening
and
confer
with
his
attorney.
if
he
attempts
to
purposely
disrupt
the
court,
i
do
not
think
that
a
contempt
sentence
is
going
to
be
effective
because
assuming
a
series
of
contempt
convictions
over
a
period
of
time
during
this
time
there
maybe
witnesses
who
could
testify,
who
will
now
no
longer
be
available
and
thereby
through
indirection
he
may
be
serving
three
or
four
contempt
terms
and
avoid
serving
a
much
more
serious
term
for
the
charges
that
are
brought
against
them.
i
think
that
there
are
more
effective
ways
of
gagging
and
binding
a
defendant
rather
the
one
which
was
used
in
the
recent
trial
in
chicago
where
the
seven
defendants.
bobby
seals
was
chained
with
a
sort
of
a
make
shift
gag
on
his
mouth.
had
the
court
used
a
straight
jacket
and
the
hospital
gag
as
we
used
in
a
recent
ohio
trial.
the
defendant
would
have
been
immobile
and
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
bite
through
the
gag
and
other
noises
to
disrupt
the
proceedings.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
to
close
circuit
the
trial,
i
mean
a
cubicle
i
think
is
impractical
because
as
was
done
in
the
senate
hearing
in
california
when
the
defendant
got
in
the
cubicle
as
a
last
effort
to
disrupt
the
proceeding
--
he
then
pretended
to
be
asleep
during
the
entire
hearing
which
lasted
two
or
three
weeks.
i
think
the
close
circuit
television
could
be
--
it's
mobile,
it
could
be
setup
and
the
cost
is
nominal.
every
bank
and
savings
and
loan
association
and
the
basis
of
a
country
have
closed
circuit
tv
every
time
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
but
at
least
he
will
be
seen
the
witnesses
and
he
will
be
able
to
communicate
with
his
attorney
and
tell
him
how
to
cross-examine.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
that
depends
on
how
the
right
of
confrontation
is
defined.
he
is
to
confront
him
for
what
purpose?
i
think
the
purposes
were
there
one
so
the
--
he
can
face
the
witness,
the
defendant
and
cross-examine.
there
is
a
second
reason
for
the
jury
to
see
the
witness.
and
reflect
on
his
demeanor
and
his
testimony.
i
don't
think
either
of
these
rights
would
be
violated
if
he
is
placed
in
a
separate
room.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
if
the
phone
is
out
of
order
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
no,
because
i
would
think
that
there
should
--
there
would
be
a
marshal
in
the
room
with
the
defendant
who
could
--
if
the
phone
is
out
of
order,
he
could
very
simply
communicate
by
a
runner
to
the
court
that
the
phone
is
not
working
and
let's
get
it
repaired
or
recess
for
10
or
15
minutes.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
he
would
still
have
the
opportunity
to
see
what
is
proceeding
if
the
phone
is
not
working
because
he
now
tries
the
phone
to
his
attorney,
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
minutes
for
him
--
for
a
runner
to
go
from
the
room
where
he's
watching
the
trial
to
the
court.
let's
say
the
phone
is
not
working,
that's
recess.
during
that
time
he
can
communicate
with
his
attorney
and
they
can
very
simply
go
over
what
he
was
unable
to
tell
him
on
the
telephone.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because
the
court
still
has
a
responsibility
and
the
courts
do
have
a
responsibility
and
we
should
not
permit
certain
defendants
to
use
of
the
power
of
the
courts
and
dictate
to
them
what
or
what
is
not
going
to
happen.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
but
at
least
he
would
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
but
he
is
not
disrupting
the
orderly
process
of
the
trial
which
is
going
on.
he
would
not
be
disrupting
the
orderly
process
of
the
trial.
the
trial
would
proceed,
he
would
not
have
the
opportunity
to
disrupt
it
which
could
be
done
if
he
was
gagged
or
bound
in
court.
or
by
ranting
and
raving
because
the
question
then
becomes
at
what
point
in
time
does
a
trial
judge
say
to
a
defendant
who
is
objecting
certain
things
which
a
trial
judge
may
be
saying
that
he
has
now
waived
his
right
to
be
present.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
would
either
have
him
bound
and
gagged
or
i
would
build
a
glass
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
why
should
that
look
bad?
historically
this
right
has
been
--
defendant
has
always
been
bound
and
gagged,
if
he
tries
to
cause
a
disturbance.
and
the
court
is
almost
every
state
in
the
union.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
think
the
best
thing
is
the
closed
circuit
to
trial
too.
i
think
the
next
best
thing
would
be
the
close
circuit
television
of
the
trial
to
the
defendant.
remove
him
so
he
doesn't
disturb
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
okay,
if
you
can't
televise
the
trial,
if
you
can't
build
a
glass
booth,
then
bind
him
and
gag
him
and
keep
him
in
court.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
prison
reading
law
books
your
honor
and
he
relied
on
that
recent
illinois
supreme
court
decision,
the
decimian
(ph)
case
which
counsel
referred
to
where
a
defendant
did
cause
a
disruption
--
he
was
removed
from
the
courtroom
for
a
moment
and
at
which
time
the
attorneys
approached
the
bench.
they
discussed
with
the
court
that
this
might
be
a
violation
of
his
rights
at
which
time
he
was
brought
back
in.
his
conviction
was
subsequently
reversed
on
other
grounds
but
the
respondent
has
advised
me
that
he
had
read
that
case
and
he
realized
that
he
had
certain
rights
and
he
was
going
to
preserve
his
rights.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
pardon?
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
i
think
the
court
had
the
right
to
do
that
but
the
problem
inherent
in
that
is
that
there
were
four
witnesses
against--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yeah
--
no,
i
don't
because
there
were
four
witnesses
against
the
respondent.
let's
say
he
goes
to
jail
for
six
months
for
contempt
of
the
court.
he
comes
out,
the
judge
says,
“can
you
stand
a
trial
again,"
he
says,
“no
i'm
not."
he's
back
in
jail
for
contempt.
he
is
in
jail
for
six
months.
meanwhile,
one
of
the
witnesses
now
moves
to
california,
one
dies,
one
become
sick
and
something
happens
to
the
other
one.
he
comes
back,
he
is
not
ready
to
stand
trial
your
honor
try
me
and
there's
no
more
witnesses.
so,
he
has
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
but
you
see
if
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
but
there
are
certain
circuits
in
where
witnesses
may
disappear,
they
may
die.
one
of
the
problems
inherent
in
this
case
--
this
case
would
be
retried
today.
i
believe
that
two
of
the
witnesses
have
died
and
one
has
subsequently
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
in
cook
county,
illinois.
so,
all
the
four
witnesses
against
him,
there
would
just
be
one
witness
who
can
possibly
testify.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
yes,
i
do.
but,
now
to
continue
on
with
what
happens
at
allen
is
that
once
the
trial
began
he
was
brought
in,
after
the
voir
dire
was
concluded.
the
judge
says,
“you
can
stay
here
if
you
remain
quiet."
he
was
non-committal
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do.
the
trial
began,
the
first
thing
that
was
done
is
that
his
court
appointed
attorney
made
a
motion
of
good
witnesses.
the
respondent
looked
around
he
didn't
see
his
friends
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
court.
his
sister
--
he
got
up
and
said,
“where's
my
witnesses?
how
can
this
trial
go
on?"
and
with
that
the
judge
ordered
him
removed
out
of
court.
he
was
in
court
four
times
the
next,
that
afternoon
which
was
during
the
prosecution's
entire
case.
there
were
four
witnesses.
two
testified
--
they
saw
him
commit
the
crime,
two
testified
that
he
admitted
to
him
that
he
committed
the
crime.
and
the
point
in
testimony
was
reached,
“do
you
see
the
man
who
did
that?"
and
the
witness
would
look
around
and
say,
“no,
i
don't"
and
the
judge
would
say,
“bring
in
the
defendant"
and
they
dragged
this
guy
in
with
handcuffs
in
a
prison
uniform
that
was
stenciled
across
the
front
maximum
security
and
they'd
say,
“that's
the
man."
and
then
they
say,
“remove
the
defendant,"
they
drag
him
out
again
four
times
in
and
out.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
sure,
keep
him
in
court,
but
don't
bring
him
in
and
out
of
the
court
every
time
you
want
to
identify
him.
i
mean,
even
in
the
most
primitive
of
identification
in
police
line
up,
they
just
don't
bring
one
person
out
and
say,
“is
that
the
man
who
did
it,"
they
at
least
bring
several
out.
here,
he
said,
“did
you
see
the
man
in
the
courtroom
when
you
look
around?"
there
are
several
faces,
“no
i
don't."
“okay,
bring
in
the
defendant."
one
guy
comes
in,
that's
the
man.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
in
the
reading
in
the
record,
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
court
appointed
attorney
for
him
did
an
excellent
job.
the
trial
judge
who
was
in
his
70's
who
may
have
had
certain
preconceived
notions
about
justice
because
he
was
a
former
prosecutor
for
many
years
as
a
first
instance
--
in
cook
county,
was
also
very
tolerant
with
this
defendant.
however,
i
felt
that
he
should
have
been
more
tolerant.
i
felt
that
once
this
dispute
began,
he
should
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
sit-down
with
this
defendant
and
explain
to
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
in
a
conversational
tone
in
chambers,
the
whole
thing
would
have
taken
five
minutes
and
not
in
the
heat
of
argument
where
the
defendant
may
not
be
paying
attention
on
what's
going
on
because
he
wants
to
preserve
his
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
was
convicted
three
times
and
i'm
advised
that
there
were
other
charges
against
him
which
he
was
never
prosecuted
on.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
when
he
was
convicted
--
he
is
38
now,
he
was
convicted
in
57,
he
was
--
mr.
h.
reed
harris
he
--
well,
i
don't
i
--
it's
not
so
much
him,
it's
what
he
stands
for
which
is
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
tried
and
preserve
his
rights
and
protect
those
rights.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
i
think
that
the
defendant
also
has
to
conduct
himself
with
respect
but
you
can
exclude
a
spectator
from
the
courtroom
without
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant
but
i
believe
that
you
cannot
do
that
to
the
defendant
because
he
has
the
right
--
the
defendant
was
on
trial.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
regardless
of
what
he
does,
he
has
--
if
he
wants
to
go
to
sleep
during
the
trial,
that's
his
right.
but
if
he
demands
the
right
to
be
there,
don't
exclude
him
so
he
can't
see
what's
going
on.
and
if
he
tries
to
disrupt
the
proceedings,
don't
let
him
be
successful,
deal
with
him,
but
preserve
his
right
in
the
event
all
of
a
sudden
he
gets
a
change
of
heart
that
he
wants
to
know
what's
going
on.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
anytime
a
defendant
is
tried,
that's
all
the
court
really
knows
it,
that
is
there
because
you
have
no
knowledge
as
to
what
he
is
doing
in
his
mind
whether
he
is
thinking
about
the
baseball
game
that
may
be
going
on
next
week
or
something
else.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
the
defendant
sit
and
be
alert
and
pay
attention
to
the
trial
--
it
just
requires
that
he
be
there
so
he
has
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
because,
if
he
changes
his
mind
that
he
wants
to
pay
attention
and
wants
to
defend
himself
he
can
then
do
it.
mr.
h.
reed
harris
well,
no,
he
was
warned
once
about
conducting
his
trial
then
that
right
was
denied
him.
i
believe
he
was
just
warned
twice
about
his
being
removed
and
when
he
didn't
pay
attention
he
was
then
removed.
and
i
don't
think
those
warnings
were
sufficient.
this
is
actually
a
case
of
first
impression;
this
court
has
never
really
ruled
on
this
issue.
the
case
as
i
cite
--
the
hopt,
case,
the
shields
to
the
lewis
case
deal
with
examination
of
jurors
or
jury
instruction
outside
the
presence
of
the
defendant
and
these
cases
rely
on
due
process
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
diaz
case
came
out
of
the
philippines
which
although
the
philippine
government
act
had
a
similar
provision
as
the
right
of
confrontation
which
was
supposedly
based
on
the
sixth
amendment.
diaz
expressly
waived
his
right
to
be
present
during
the
trial.one
of
the
reason
it
was
because
the
trial
took
several
months
and
they
would
recess
for
30
or
60
days
and
he
has
lived
way
far
from
the
court
and
it
was
inconvenient
from
the
bean
(ph)
court
so
we
said,
"we'll
proceed
without
him,
there's
only
one
or
two
–
it's
just
going
to
be
heard,"
"my
attorney
will
be
there,
he
can
handle
it
for
me."
i
don't
believe
that
would,
what
mr.
justice
cardozo
said
in
schneider
is
applicable
because
that
was
a
case
involving
whether
a
defendant
had
the
right
to
go
to
a
view
of
a
scene
with
the
jury
under
massachusetts
law
that
right
did
not
exist
although
the
right
exists
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions.
mr.
justice
cardozo
was
in
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
at
this
time
the
certain
rights
out
of
the
sixth
amendment
first
time
have
been
said
that
and
incorporated
and
applied
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
sixth
amendment
historically
--
the
right
of
confrontation,
it's
not
clear
where
it
came
from.
some
people
say
that
some
commentators
say
it
comes
basically
from
the
evils
of
the
star
chamber
proceedings
in
england.
others
say
it
stems
from
the
injustice
which
happened
to
sir
walter
raleigh
who
was
tried
in
1603
for
treason.
this
in
effect
was
really
an
early
political
trial.
queen
elizabeth
had
died
and
her
successor,
i
believe
was
king
charles
wasn't
pleased
with
rollie.
rollie
had
caused
the
death
of
the
(inaudible).
