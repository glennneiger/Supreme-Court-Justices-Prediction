(inaudible)
would
you
say,
we
must
find
the
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
w
hat
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
waived
anything.
what
if
he
waives
during
the
trial,
did
you
tell
him
he
was
not
going
to
be
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlaps)
you
say
he
waived
what?
why
didn't
he
waive
the
whole
but
he
had
told
you
he
didn't
want
to
be
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
–
you
must
be
talking
about
trial
or
talking
about
forfeiture
and
talking
about
waive?
what
you
have
here
is
the
man
who
defies
the
court
and
told
he
was
not
to
be
tried.
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
kept
making
a
noise
to
keep
himself
from
being
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
it
would
make
whether
you
call
it
the
forfeiture
or
waiver?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
says
from
the
beginning
and
sticks
to
it
and
i
am
not
going
to
be
tried.
i
will
do
anything
to
prevent
the
trial
and
what
(inaudible)
is
the
telephone
--
he
still
wouldn't
be
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
his
plan
but
he
intends,
what
goes
with
that?
why
should
the
state
have
to
govern,
would
have
to
go
to
all
of
that
trouble
to
try
unless
the
court
should
become
absolutely
impetus
to
carry
on
the
responsibilities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
say
but
i'm
not
going
to
be
tried
well
would
he
cooperate
anymore
if
you
put
him
on
somewhere
where
he
could
get
a
telephone
and
call
up
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
for
other
reasons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
a
lawyer,
what
do
you
think
is,
what
would
you
suggest
that
a
judge
is
under
a
duty
to
do
but
the
defendant
announces
you
will
not
be
tried
and
conducts
himself
so
as
to
prevent
a
trial
in
the
courtroom?
or
do
you
think
would
really
be
the
best?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlaps),
wouldn't
it?
after
about
an
hour
to
alternative,
that
was
pretty
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
you
take
(voice
overlaps)
better.
now,
what
else
would
you
think
would
be
better?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
get
out
of
the
small
county
like
our
practice
at
once
he
didn't
have
anything
like
that,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
should
have
been
done
but
of
course,
we
are
not
ready
to
say
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
judge
could
simply
say,
“alright,
you
say
you
will
not
be
tried,
i
will
let
you
go
to
jail
and
stay
until
you're
ready
for
a
trial.
i
will
declare
mistrial
in
this
case
and
when
you
want
a
trial
you
can
get
him."
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
is
about
the
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
life
–
things
that
happen
and
different
would
always
happen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
remember
trying
a
case
once
in
12
years
that's
a
murder
was
committed.
it's
no
plenty
witnesses
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree,
won't
you
that
something
has
to
be
done
to
keep
the
court
--
the
big
subject
to
such
indignity
with
such
frustrations
of
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
this
man
was
given
about
as
fair
a
trail
as
it
would
possible
for
him
to
get?
(voice

in
the
