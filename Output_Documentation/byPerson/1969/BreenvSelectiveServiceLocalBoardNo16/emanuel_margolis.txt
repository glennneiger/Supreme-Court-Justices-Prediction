mr.
emanuel
margolis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
i
think,
can
be
fairly
reduced
to
the
following
whether
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
oestereich
and
gabriel.
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
precludes
pre-induction
judicial
review
of
delinquency,
reclassification
processes
by
local
draft
board
against
a
full
time
undergraduate
student
who
is
statutorily
entitled
to
a
ii-s
classification
simply
because
he
surrendered
his
draft
card
to
a
clergymen
to
register
his
dissent
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
put
another
way,
the
question
is,
does
oestereich
control
this
case
or
does
gabriel
control
it?
the
facts
in
the
case
are
admitted
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
and
are
further
agreed
to
and
the
agreed
statement
on
appeal
which
is
part
of
the
appendix.
the
petitioner
at
the
time
in
question
was
a
19-year
old
undergraduate
student
at
the
berklee
school
of
music
in
1967,
a
school
located
in
boston,
massachusetts.
at
that
time,
he
was
satisfactorily
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
at
the
college
and
was
properly
classified
by
his
local
board,
board
number
16
in
bridgeport,
connecticut
as
a
ii-s
for
the
academic
year
in
1967
to
1968.
at
all
relevant
times,
the
petitioner
maintained
the
necessary
status
for
his
ii-s
in
full
compliance
with
all
of
the
statutory
requirements.
on
november
16th
1967,
the
petitioner
along
with
numerous
others
took
part
in
a
meeting
at
the
arlington
street
church
in
boston
protesting
the
war
in
vietnam
and
in
the
course
of
this
meeting
delivered
his
registration
certificate
along
with
a
number
of
other
registrants
to
a
clergymen
for
the
sole
purpose
of
registering
his
dissent
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
the
action
by
the
petitioner
was
peaceful.
it
was
nonviolent
and
it
was
expressed
as
a
form
of
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
a
few
weeks
prior
to
this
occasion,
a
memorandum
and
letter
was
issued
from
the
director
of
selective
service
general
hershey
which
was
addressed
to
all
members
and
officials
of
the
selective
service
system.
this
memorandum
and
letter
which
we
will
herein
after
refer
to
as
the
hershey
directive
and
instructed
and
advised
the
members
of
the
system
to
strip
deferments
and
exemptions
from
all
registrants
who
in
anyway
violate
the
selective
service
regulations
or
its
related
processes
or
who
take
part
in
any
so-called
illegal
demonstrations.
the
directive
further
recommended
that
the
delinquency
reclassification
induction
procedure
be
pursued
for
any
registrant
who
abandons
his
draft
card
or
his
classification
card.
subsequent
to
the
action
by
the
petitioner
on
january
9th,
1968,
he
received
a
simultaneous
declaration
of
delinquency
and
reclassification
in
the
mail,
reclassification
from
ii-s
to
i-a.
this
was
a
clear
implementation
of
the
directive
of
general
hershey
and
as
the
court
below
aptly
put
it,
it
was
certainly
in
line
with
this
directive.
the
ground
set
forth
in
the
delinquency
notice
were
“failure
to
have
registrations
certificate
in
your
possession”.
two
days
later,
the
petitioner
was
ordered
for
a
physical
examination
and
in
early
february
of
1968,
he
appealed
his
reclassification.
the
litigation
below
was
commenced
on
february
20th,
1968
in
the
district
court
for
connecticut
wherein
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
and
other
relief
was
asked
by
way
of
a
remedy
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
together
with
other
forms
of
relief
including
damages.
the
initial
hearing
before
that
court
took
place
on
march
1st
1968
where
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
obtained.
however,
on
march
8,
1968,
all
of
the
petitioner’s
claims
for
relief
were
denied,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
dissolved
and
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
primarily
on
the
grounds
that
10
(b)
(3)
deprived
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction.
on
april
30,
1968,
subsequent
to
the
litigation,
the
appeal
board
for
connecticut
confirmed
the
classification
of
the
petitioner's
i-a.
prior
to
that
time
had
passed
his
physical
examination
and
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
he
has
not
reported
for
induction
based
on
stays
obtained
by
the
district
court
subsequently
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
eventually
by
this
court.
the
rationale
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
upholding
the
action
of
the
district
court
was
geared
clearly
to
differentiation
which
it
drew
between
this
court's
decisions
and
oestereich
and
in
gabriel.
the
court
held
that
oestereich
was
distinguishable
based
on
a
demarcation
between
exemption
and
deferment
under
the
statute
with
extremely
heavy
reliance
upon
gabriel.
petitioner
contends
that
the
essential
error
below
is
in
the
failure
of
the
majority
in
its
opinion
to
identify
the
case
as
it
should
have
with
oestereich
rather
than
with
gabriel.
we
submit
that
the
oestereich
case
clearly
and
unmistakably
controls
the
case
at
bar
and
we
submit
this
initially
for
factual
reasons
because
the
salient
facts
in
both
oestereich
and
in
a
case
at
bar
are
absolutely
identical
in
at
least
seven
respects.
in
the
first
place,
both
cases
involved
full
time
undergraduate
students.
second,
both
involved
the
surrender
of
draft
cards
as
a
conscientious
dissent
by
personal
commitment
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
third,
both
involved
explicit
and
unqualified
statutory
rights
at
stake
in
both
cases.
fourth,
there
is
in
neither
case
any
discretion
or
exercise
of
judgment
or
weighing
of
evidence
by
the
local
board.
fifth,
both
involve
the
application
of
the
delinquency
regulations
directly
pursuant
to
the
hershey
directive.
sixth,
the
registrants
in
both
cases
were
punitively
reclassified
i-a
pursuant
to
that
directive.
and
seventh,
there
was
a
simultaneous
declaration
in
both
cases
of
delinquency
and
a
i-a
reclassification.
petitioner
submits
that
the
facts
in
gabriel
are
not
reconcilable
with
any
single
one
of
those
seven
factual
elements
in
oestereich
and
breen,
and
for
that
reason,
gabriel
is
irrelevant
to
consideration
of
the
case
at
bar.
we
submit
by
way
of
legal
argument
that
the
exemption,
deferment,
distinction
which
was
drawn
by
the
court
below
and
on
which
heavy
emphasis
is
placed
by
the
respondents
is
totally
unsupported
in
at
least
four
aspects.
the
first
place,
unsupported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
reflects
the
congressional
intent
in
passing
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
secondly,
it
is
unsupported
by
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
thirdly,
it's
unsupported
by
the
wording
of
the
selective
service
regulations.
and
fourthly,
it
is
unsupported
by
the
pertinent
and
relevant
case
law
by
court
of
appeal’s
decisions
below.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
extensively
described
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
this
act
and
in
particular
in
house
report
number
267
which
stresses
the
importance
in
the
passage
of
the
new
act
of
immunizing
full
time
undergraduate
students
from
any
disruption
of
their
education
by
way
of
untimely
induction
and
stressing
further
the
fact
that
this
was
in
the
public
interest
or
this
clear
and
unmistakable
immunity
to
apply.
there
was
a
very
distinct
effort
on
the
part
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
to
remove
local
board
discretion
based
on
class
standing
in
favor
of
what
is
described
in
the
legislative
history
as
a
uniform
deferment
policy
with
a
statutory
and
clear
cut
criteria
for
all
undergraduate
student
deferments
and
also
significant
and
i
intend
to
go
back
to
this
later
on.
the
new
statute
in
1967
removes
the
discretionary
term
authorize,
where
the
president
has
authorized
to
grant
student
deferments
and
replaces
it
with
the
mandatory
word
‘shall’
and
further
goes
on
to
remove
the
further
discretionary
language
in
the
old
act
which
talked
about
authorizing
deferments
only
when
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
national
health
safety
or
interest,
that
was
removed
and
what
we
now
have
in
the
statute
are
five
clear
cut
statutory
criteria
leaving
no
discretion
to
the
local
boards
whatsoever
if
these
criteria
are
met.
namely,
that
a
ii-s
will
be
granted
in
the
following
instances.
first,
if
the
student
is
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction;
second,
if
he
is
attending
a
college,
a
university
or
a
similar
institution
of
higher
learning;
third,
that
he
is
pursuing
a
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily;
fourth,
if
he
has
not
yet
attained
a
baccalaureate
degree;
and
fifth,
if
he
has
not
attained
his
24th
birthday.
these
are
the
clear
statutory
criteria
set
forth
by
the
congress
deliberately
and
intentionally,
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistaking
about
when
a
student
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
his
deferment.
and
as
far
as
the
case
at
bar
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question.
it's
not
contested
that
mr.
breen
met
every
single
one
of
these
criteria.
the
national
policy
and
the
statutory
criteria
are
further
reflected
in
the
specific
restriction
upon
the
president
which
was
also
introduced
in
the
1967
statute
was
non-existent
prior
to
that
time,
that
such
deferments
shall
not
be
restricted
or
terminated
without
a
specific
finding
by
the
president
--
that
the
needs
of
the
armed
forces
require
such
action
and
of
course,
there
has
been
no
such
finding
by
the
president
of
united
states.
so
that
taking
all
of
these
elements
together,
it
is
not
surprising
that
if
the
dissenting
opinion
below
pointed
out
that
this
is
about
as
clear
a
statement
of
congressional
intent
as
you
can
get
made
all
and
more
specific,
all
the
more
emphatic
rather
by
its
appearance
in
the
selective
service
act
for
the
first
time
in
the
1967
amendments.
the
statute
insofar
as
congressional
intent
is
concerned,
is
further
buttressed
in
the
following
way
by
a
very
brief
except
that
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
conference
report
of
the
senate
and
house
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
and
talking
about
these
changes.
this
is
what
the
report
says
at
1359
of
the
house
report
number
267.
the
language
incorporates
the
original
house
recommendation
in
respect
to
undergraduate
student
deferments
and
would
provide
them
uniformly
to
all
registrants
who
requested
and
qualified
for
such
a
deferment.
these
undergraduate
deferments
would
continue
only
until
a
registrant
had
received
the
baccalaureate
degree,
failed
to
continue
to
pursue
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily
or
reached
the
age
of
24
whichever
occurred
first.
i
submit
there's
no
question
about
the
legislative
intent
here.
now,
the
other
main
problem
of
respondent's
argument
has
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
an
exempt
registrant
as
in
oestereich
is
somehow
outside
the
system,
outside
the
selective
service
system
entirely
and
it
quotes,
a
court
of
appeal’s
decision
anderson
against
hershey
in
support
of
this
rationale.
petitioner
contends
that
an
exempt
student
is
no
more
outside
the
system
than
a
deferred
system
--
than
a
deferred
student.
and
section
6
(k)
of
the
statute
leaves
absolutely
no
doubt
on
this
point
as
does
section
5
of
the
statute
leave
there
a
continuing
references
to
deferred
and
exempt
students.
there
are
no
distinctions
drawn
between
exemptions
and
deferments
with
these
purposes
under
the
statute.
the
regulations,
section
1625.1
state
unconditionally
that
no
classification
is
permanent.
now,
to
take
the
oestereich
situation
and
compare
it
with
the
breen
situation,
we
can
see
this
in
operation
very
clearly.
if
oestereich,
a
divinity
student
had
finished
his
divinity
school
at
the
seminary
and
having
completed
his
school
then
decided
that
he
was
going
to
enter
a
law
school
or
he
then
decided
that
he
was
going
to
drive
a
bus
or
become
a
carpenter,
can
there
be
any
question
at
all
that
he
would
not
be
outside
the
system
simply
because
he
had
a
iv-d
originally?
and
let's
reverse
the
situation.
let's
take
the
case
of
the
petitioner
who
was
attending
the
berklee
school
of
music
and
let's
assume
that
having
concluded
the
berklee
school
of
music
or
even
while
he
was
there,
he
transferred
to
a
divinity
school.
would
he
be
outside
the
system
at
that
point
simply
because
he
had
transferred
to
a
divinity
school?
it's
obvious
under
the
statute
as
well
as
under
the
regulations
that
any
change
in
the
circumstances
of
a
registrant
can
produce
a
change
in
his
classification.
that's
what
the
classification,
regulations
are
all
about
and
that
there
is
clearly
no
person
who
is
within
the
system,
no
registrant
who
is
within
the
system
who
simply
because
he
has
an
exemption
is
outside
the
system.
that
was
never
intended
and
it's
nowhere
to
be
found.
indeed,
it
may
be
said,
now
there
has
been
said
by
several
courts
below
that
both
exempt
and
deferred
registrants
are
outside
the
pool
of
manpower
and
that's
true,
they
are
outside
the
pool
of
manpower
but
that
hardly
places
them
outside
the
system.
this
is
further
--
i
think
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
the
exemption
deferment,
demarcation
line
which
the
government
tries
so
desperately
to
draw
particularly
after
oestereich
is
almost
impossible
to
define
when
examining
the
various
kinds
of
classifications
which
exist
both
under
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
when
one
moves
from
such
classification
is
iv-f
which
is
an
exemption
and
i-y
which
is
an
exemption
and
then
moves
on
i-d
which
is
a
deferment,
there
is
no
logical
order
of
priority,
there
is
no
systematic
attempt
to
say
that
we
have
a
series
of
exemptions
which
are
going
to
be
treated
in
one
fashion
exclusively
a
series
of
deferments
which
are
going
to
be
treated
in
another
fashion
exclusively
and
at
one
is
in
a
higher
order
of
priority,
one
is
in
the
lower
order
of
priority.
indeed,
the
regulations
themselves
show
a
mixture
and
that
mixture
of
exemptions
and
deferments
in
terms
of
persons
who
are
in
the
highest
order
of
priority
at
i-a
down
to
the
lowest
order
of
priority
which
is
i-c.
another,
i
think,
prime
example
to
illustrate
this
point
would
be
in
the
case
of
federal
judges
who
under
the
statute
and
under
the
regulations
have
deferments.
the
federal
judge
is
obviously
appointed
for
life
but
he
only
has
a
deferment.
now,
is
it
going
to
be
suggested
by
the
government
that
a
federal
judge
is
somehow
rather
inside
the
system
but
a
divinity
student
at
the
end
of
a
theological
seminary
is
somehow
rather
outside
the
system,
it
makes
no
sense.
there
is
no
rational
distinction
recognized
by
either
the
statute
or
by
the
regulations
and
i
think
that
the
three
justices
of
this
court
who
filed
their
dissenting
opinion
in
oestereich
has
much
as
said
so
particularly
as
indicated
in
footnote
nine
of
their
opinion.
this
was
also
practically
conceded
by
counsel
for
selective
service
system
in
the
brief
for
the
solicitor
general
filed
in
the
oestereich
case
calling
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
footnote
on
page
68
where
again,
there
was
practically
a
concession
that
you
couldn't
draw
these
fine
distinctions.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
deferment.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that's
a
deferment
(voice
overlap).
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
a
deferment.
that's
correct.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
as
long
as
he
is
vice
president,
he
only
has
a
deferment.
that
would
be
under
classification
iv-b.
that's
only
he
has.
he
has
no
exemption.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that's
true
of
members
of
this
court.
all
the
members
of
the
court
have
our
deferments.
the
gentlemen
are
not
exempted,
at
least
not
specifically
under
iv-b,
that's
the
classification.
now,
the
distinction
i
think
which
needs
to
be
drawn
in
obviously
some
line
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
other
cases
before
this
court
that
needs
to
be
drawn
is
not
between
exemptions
on
the
one
hand
and
deferments
on
the
other
but
rather
between
those
exemptions
and
deferments
which
are
unequivocally
and
unconditionally
granted
by
statute
on
the
one
side
such
as
veterans,
such
as
sole
surviving
sons,
such
as
full
time
students,
elected
officials
and
the
like
where
you
have
exemptions
and
deferments
there
and
those
exemptions
and
deferments
which
are
granted
by
statute
but
which
are
subject
to
findings
of
fact,
which
are
subject
to
exercise
of
judgment
by
local
boards
and
weighing
of
evidence
where
again
you
got
exemptions
and
deferments
such
as
in
the
case
of
iv-f's,
in
the
case
of
conscientious
objectors,
in
the
case
of
dependency
and
hardship
deferments.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
submit
that
the
gabriel
case
itself
is
a
prime
example
to
illustrate
this
point
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
conscientious
objector
which
involves
an
exemption,
if
he
is
entitled
to
conscientious
objective
status
that
would
be
an
exemption
and
yet
you've
got
so
clearly
a
case
where
there's
got
to
be
discretion
exercised
by
the
board
that
has
got
to
be
weighing
of
the
evidence.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
think
that
the
scope
of
his
discretion
would
be
limited
only
to
the
statutory
criteria.
if
the
director
finds
and
that
by
way
of
the
local
board
that
a
student
is
not
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
that
might
be
a
factual
determination
or
if
he
finds
that
he
is
not
pursuing
that
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily
which
are
the
statutory
criteria
then
i
would
certainly
say,
there
would
be
a
basis
for
a
weighing,
for
a
judgment,
for
discretionary
act
by
the
local
board
which
may
indeed
be
barred
by
10
(b)
(3)
but
certainly
where
there
are
criteria
totally
irrelevant
to
the
statutory
criteria
such
as
in
the
case
at
bar
where
the
only
basis
for
doing
what
the
board
did
and
this
is
conceded
as
the
turning
over
of
a
registration
certificate
to
a
clergymen
by
way
of
an
expression
of
dissent
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
and
at
that
point
the
selective
service
director
cannot
do
anything
about
taking
away
a
ii-s
classification,
i
would
submit.
the
only
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
so
i
can
reserve
a
little
time
later
on
if
the
court
please
is
that
the
case
is
cited
by
the
government
that
three
court
of
appeals
cases
cited
by
government,
give
it
small
comfort
in
attempting
to
arrange
for
what
is
obviously
a
divorce
of
convenience
as
between
the
exemption
on
the
one
side
and
deferment
on
the
other.
the
kolden
case
which
it
cites
by
dictum
is
in
full
accord
with
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
there
is
clear
and
rather
it's
a
repeated
dictum
indicating
that
the
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
be
a
bar
in
kolden
where
a
ii-s
undergraduate
student,
full
time
undergraduate
student
was
involved.
the
kraus
case
involving
a
iii-a
deferment
is
governed
by
statutory
language
authorizing
not
mandating
but
authorizing
the
president
to
grant
a
deferment
subject
to
certain
specific
conditions
in
6
(h)
(2),
again
not
applicable.
and
as
far
as
anderson
against
hershey
is
concerned,
which
they
cite
in
their
brief
that
is
again
the
rationale
that
an
exemption
is
outside
the
selective
service
system
which
we
have
already
dealt
with.
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
i
think
are
terribly
important
particularly
the
carey
case
which
was
decided
in
the
second
circuit.
it
is
important
because
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision
in
which
two
of
the
three
judges,
and
that
case
ironically
and
perhaps
incongruously
held
that
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
be
a
bar
to
a
review
of
a
denial
of
a
i-s
classification
and
set
forth
that
where
there
is
no
basis
for
withdrawing
it
and
where
there
is
a
statutory
grant,
it
cannot
be
taken
away
by
the
selective
service
system.
and
if
there
is
a
legal
relationship
involved
as
there
was
in
carey
and
whether
there
was
a
statutory
interpretation
to
be
applied
as
there
was
in
that
case,
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
local
board
nor
is
this
a
matter
to
await
a
criminal
prosecution
but
that
it
is
a
matter
which
is
entitled
to
early
judicial
review.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that
was
subsequent
to
the
oestereich
decision,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
subsequent
to
the
breen
decision.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
a
different
panel
but
interestingly
enough
of
the
three
judges
on
that
panel,
two
of
them
are
judges
moore
and
friendly
were
in
the
majority
in
breen.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
it
is.
we
did
not
have
the
citation
at
that
time
because
it
had
not
yet
been
published.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
can
give
it
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
can
do
it
later,
your
honor,
i
cannot
locate
it
right
now.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
very
briefly
answerable
to
the
points
that
were
stated
by
mr.
ruckelshaus,
i
am
interested
to
learn
that
he
concedes
that
there
elements
of
punishment
in
what
happened
to
the
petitioner
in
this,
so
i
think
that
as
an
important
concession
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
take
that
in
a
consideration
of
dovetails
with
the
argument
that
--
part
of
the
argument
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
as
well
as
the
argument
on
the
delinquency
regulations
which
we
have
incorporated
from
the
brief
in
gutknecht
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
far
as
the
gutknecht
case
is
concerned;
it's
very
different
from
this
and
one
major
respect.
gutknecht
was
not
reclassified
punitively
which
was
the
case
here
and
therefore,
it's
a
totally
different
factual
situation
but
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
that
because
the
honorable
members
of
this
court
would
be
given
all
the
facts
in
that
case
tomorrow.
as
far
as
the
statement
by
the
government
that
there
has
been
no
effort
to
implement
the
hershey
directive
that
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
this
comes
as
a
complete
shock
to
petitioner
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
agreed
statement
on
appeal
concedes
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
in
this
--
all
the
allegations
to
that
complaint
of
course
are
admitted.
in
terms
of
the
posture
of
the
case
alleges
that
this
action
was
taken
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
said
directive,
the
court
of
appeals
below
had
no
difficulty
at
all
with
that
issue
and
stated
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
and
i
quote
from
it,
the
majority
stated
that
these
actions
of
the
board
were
in
line
with
the
memorandum
and
letter
dated
respectively
october
24
and
october
26,
1967.
so
i
don't
know
how
that
really
can
be
placed
in
issue
at
this
time.
furthermore,
as
far
as
the
pursuit
of
these
kinds
of
processes
and
procedures
of
punitive
reclassification
pursuant
to
the
hershey
directive,
i
recall
a
court
to
an
as
yet
unpublished,
series
of
hearings
before
the
senate
sub-committee
on
administrative
practice
and
procedure
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
were
held
before
or
rather
on
november
3rd,
1969,
they
are
not
yet
as
published
that
i
have
received
copies
of
the
transcript
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
before
that
committee
of
former
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
who
concedes
that
in
fact
this
kind
of
process
and
procedure
pursuant
to
the
hershey
memorandum
and
letter
did
in
fact
take
place.
the
policy
argument
of
litigious
interruption,
i
think,
is
one
that
really
needs
to
be
met
and
i
had
intended
to
meet
it
except
we're
running
out
of
time
but
i
think
this
maybe
the
time.
this
is
something
which
of
course
is
a
policy
argument
that
the
government
has
made
throughout
not
just
in
this
case
but
in
prior
cases
and
i
think
it
was
amply
answered
not
only
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich
with
a
specific
reference
to
it.
but
it's
also
have
been
answered
particularly
well
by
judge
bazelon
in
the
case
of
national
students
association
versus
hershey
in
footnote
17
where
he
points
out
that
in
order
to
really
preclude
a
litigious
interruption,
congress
would
in
fact
have
to
bar
a
post
induction
review
as
well
as
pre-induction
review
by
way
of
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
since
an
invalidation
made
in
a
post
induction
suit
would
have
precisely
the
same
effect
as
if
it
were
made
prior
to
induction.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
your
honor?
mr.
emanuel
margolis
no,
but
i
think
when
the
reference
is
made
to
litigious
interruption,
then
the
policy
is
not
with
reference
to
interruption
of
service,
it's
with
reference
to
the
interruption
of
calling
men
to
service
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
calling
men
into
the
armed
forces.
now,
in
many
of
these
situations,
i
would
submit
in
most
of
these
situations
where
arguments
geared
to
the
law,
geared
to
the
procedures,
geared
to
the
statute
only
are
involved
and
no
factual
determinations
are
involved
would
not
make
more
sense
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
allow
these
matters
to
be
heard
preliminarily
by
a
federal
court
whether
on
a
claim
for
injunction
or
a
declaratory
judgment
or
both,
let
the
matter
be
heard
on
the
basis
of
oral
arguments
and
briefs
at
that
time
and
at
that
point,
the
registrant
will
know
what
his
legal
rights
are,
the
respondents
will
know
what
the
legal
duties
are
of
the
draft
board
and
certainly
there
will
be
no
risk
to
be
run
by
the
registrant
later
on,
and
risking
an
indictment,
and
a
prosecution
and
if
he's
wrong,
of
course
he
is
facing
not
only
the
(inaudible)
of
that
but
possibly
five
years
in
jail
and
a
$10,000
fine.
this
litigious
interruption
argument
i
think
bears
no
real
weight
when
examined
carefully
as
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
was
suggested
in
the
opinion
by
judge
bazelon.
and
i
trust
that
the
court
would
give
this
the
weight
that
it
deserves
which
is
very
little.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
i
think,
can
be
fairly
reduced
to
the
following
whether
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
oestereich
and
gabriel.
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
precludes
pre-induction
judicial
review
of
delinquency,
reclassification
processes
by
local
draft
board
against
a
full
time
undergraduate
student
who
is
statutorily
entitled
to
a
ii-s
classification
simply
because
he
surrendered
his
draft
card
to
a
clergymen
to
register
his
dissent
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
put
another
way,
the
question
is,
does
oestereich
control
this
case
or
does
gabriel
control
it?
the
facts
in
the
case
are
admitted
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
and
are
further
agreed
to
and
the
agreed
statement
on
appeal
which
is
part
of
the
appendix.
the
petitioner
at
the
time
in
question
was
a
19-year
old
undergraduate
student
at
the
berklee
school
of
music
in
1967,
a
school
located
in
boston,
massachusetts.
at
that
time,
he
was
satisfactorily
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
at
the
college
and
was
properly
classified
by
his
local
board,
board
number
16
in
bridgeport,
connecticut
as
a
ii-s
for
the
academic
year
in
1967
to
1968.
at
all
relevant
times,
the
petitioner
maintained
the
necessary
status
for
his
ii-s
in
full
compliance
with
all
of
the
statutory
requirements.
on
november
16th
1967,
the
petitioner
along
with
numerous
others
took
part
in
a
meeting
at
the
arlington
street
church
in
boston
protesting
the
war
in
vietnam
and
in
the
course
of
this
meeting
delivered
his
registration
certificate
along
with
a
number
of
other
registrants
to
a
clergymen
for
the
sole
purpose
of
registering
his
dissent
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
the
action
by
the
petitioner
was
peaceful.
it
was
nonviolent
and
it
was
expressed
as
a
form
of
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
a
few
weeks
prior
to
this
occasion,
a
memorandum
and
letter
was
issued
from
the
director
of
selective
service
general
hershey
which
was
addressed
to
all
members
and
officials
of
the
selective
service
system.
this
memorandum
and
letter
which
we
will
herein
after
refer
to
as
the
hershey
directive
and
instructed
and
advised
the
members
of
the
system
to
strip
deferments
and
exemptions
from
all
registrants
who
in
anyway
violate
the
selective
service
regulations
or
its
related
processes
or
who
take
part
in
any
so-called
illegal
demonstrations.
the
directive
further
recommended
that
the
delinquency
reclassification
induction
procedure
be
pursued
for
any
registrant
who
abandons
his
draft
card
or
his
classification
card.
subsequent
to
the
action
by
the
petitioner
on
january
9th,
1968,
he
received
a
simultaneous
declaration
of
delinquency
and
reclassification
in
the
mail,
reclassification
from
ii-s
to
i-a.
this
was
a
clear
implementation
of
the
directive
of
general
hershey
and
as
the
court
below
aptly
put
it,
it
was
certainly
in
line
with
this
directive.
the
ground
set
forth
in
the
delinquency
notice
were
“failure
to
have
registrations
certificate
in
your
possession”.
two
days
later,
the
petitioner
was
ordered
for
a
physical
examination
and
in
early
february
of
1968,
he
appealed
his
reclassification.
the
litigation
below
was
commenced
on
february
20th,
1968
in
the
district
court
for
connecticut
wherein
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
and
other
relief
was
asked
by
way
of
a
remedy
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
together
with
other
forms
of
relief
including
damages.
the
initial
hearing
before
that
court
took
place
on
march
1st
1968
where
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
obtained.
however,
on
march
8,
1968,
all
of
the
petitioner’s
claims
for
relief
were
denied,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
dissolved
and
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
primarily
on
the
grounds
that
10
(b)
(3)
deprived
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction.
on
april
30,
1968,
subsequent
to
the
litigation,
the
appeal
board
for
connecticut
confirmed
the
classification
of
the
petitioner's
i-a.
prior
to
that
time
had
passed
his
physical
examination
and
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
he
has
not
reported
for
induction
based
on
stays
obtained
by
the
district
court
subsequently
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
eventually
by
this
court.
the
rationale
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
upholding
the
action
of
the
district
court
was
geared
clearly
to
differentiation
which
it
drew
between
this
court's
decisions
and
oestereich
and
in
gabriel.
the
court
held
that
oestereich
was
distinguishable
based
on
a
demarcation
between
exemption
and
deferment
under
the
statute
with
extremely
heavy
reliance
upon
gabriel.
petitioner
contends
that
the
essential
error
below
is
in
the
failure
of
the
majority
in
its
opinion
to
identify
the
case
as
it
should
have
with
oestereich
rather
than
with
gabriel.
we
submit
that
the
oestereich
case
clearly
and
unmistakably
controls
the
case
at
bar
and
we
submit
this
initially
for
factual
reasons
because
the
salient
facts
in
both
oestereich
and
in
a
case
at
bar
are
absolutely
identical
in
at
least
seven
respects.
in
the
first
place,
both
cases
involved
full
time
undergraduate
students.
second,
both
involved
the
surrender
of
draft
cards
as
a
conscientious
dissent
by
personal
commitment
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
third,
both
involved
explicit
and
unqualified
statutory
rights
at
stake
in
both
cases.
fourth,
there
is
in
neither
case
any
discretion
or
exercise
of
judgment
or
weighing
of
evidence
by
the
local
board.
fifth,
both
involve
the
application
of
the
delinquency
regulations
directly
pursuant
to
the
hershey
directive.
sixth,
the
registrants
in
both
cases
were
punitively
reclassified
i-a
pursuant
to
that
directive.
and
seventh,
there
was
a
simultaneous
declaration
in
both
cases
of
delinquency
and
a
i-a
reclassification.
petitioner
submits
that
the
facts
in
gabriel
are
not
reconcilable
with
any
single
one
of
those
seven
factual
elements
in
oestereich
and
breen,
and
for
that
reason,
gabriel
is
irrelevant
to
consideration
of
the
case
at
bar.
we
submit
by
way
of
legal
argument
that
the
exemption,
deferment,
distinction
which
was
drawn
by
the
court
below
and
on
which
heavy
emphasis
is
placed
by
the
respondents
is
totally
unsupported
in
at
least
four
aspects.
the
first
place,
unsupported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
reflects
the
congressional
intent
in
passing
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
secondly,
it
is
unsupported
by
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
thirdly,
it's
unsupported
by
the
wording
of
the
selective
service
regulations.
and
fourthly,
it
is
unsupported
by
the
pertinent
and
relevant
case
law
by
court
of
appeal’s
decisions
below.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
extensively
described
in
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
this
act
and
in
particular
in
house
report
number
267
which
stresses
the
importance
in
the
passage
of
the
new
act
of
immunizing
full
time
undergraduate
students
from
any
disruption
of
their
education
by
way
of
untimely
induction
and
stressing
further
the
fact
that
this
was
in
the
public
interest
or
this
clear
and
unmistakable
immunity
to
apply.
there
was
a
very
distinct
effort
on
the
part
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
to
remove
local
board
discretion
based
on
class
standing
in
favor
of
what
is
described
in
the
legislative
history
as
a
uniform
deferment
policy
with
a
statutory
and
clear
cut
criteria
for
all
undergraduate
student
deferments
and
also
significant
and
i
intend
to
go
back
to
this
later
on.
the
new
statute
in
1967
removes
the
discretionary
term
authorize,
where
the
president
has
authorized
to
grant
student
deferments
and
replaces
it
with
the
mandatory
word
‘shall’
and
further
goes
on
to
remove
the
further
discretionary
language
in
the
old
act
which
talked
about
authorizing
deferments
only
when
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
national
health
safety
or
interest,
that
was
removed
and
what
we
now
have
in
the
statute
are
five
clear
cut
statutory
criteria
leaving
no
discretion
to
the
local
boards
whatsoever
if
these
criteria
are
met.
namely,
that
a
ii-s
will
be
granted
in
the
following
instances.
first,
if
the
student
is
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction;
second,
if
he
is
attending
a
college,
a
university
or
a
similar
institution
of
higher
learning;
third,
that
he
is
pursuing
a
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily;
fourth,
if
he
has
not
yet
attained
a
baccalaureate
degree;
and
fifth,
if
he
has
not
attained
his
24th
birthday.
these
are
the
clear
statutory
criteria
set
forth
by
the
congress
deliberately
and
intentionally,
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistaking
about
when
a
student
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
his
deferment.
and
as
far
as
the
case
at
bar
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question.
it's
not
contested
that
mr.
breen
met
every
single
one
of
these
criteria.
the
national
policy
and
the
statutory
criteria
are
further
reflected
in
the
specific
restriction
upon
the
president
which
was
also
introduced
in
the
1967
statute
was
non-existent
prior
to
that
time,
that
such
deferments
shall
not
be
restricted
or
terminated
without
a
specific
finding
by
the
president
--
that
the
needs
of
the
armed
forces
require
such
action
and
of
course,
there
has
been
no
such
finding
by
the
president
of
united
states.
so
that
taking
all
of
these
elements
together,
it
is
not
surprising
that
if
the
dissenting
opinion
below
pointed
out
that
this
is
about
as
clear
a
statement
of
congressional
intent
as
you
can
get
made
all
and
more
specific,
all
the
more
emphatic
rather
by
its
appearance
in
the
selective
service
act
for
the
first
time
in
the
1967
amendments.
the
statute
insofar
as
congressional
intent
is
concerned,
is
further
buttressed
in
the
following
way
by
a
very
brief
except
that
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
conference
report
of
the
senate
and
house
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
and
talking
about
these
changes.
this
is
what
the
report
says
at
1359
of
the
house
report
number
267.
the
language
incorporates
the
original
house
recommendation
in
respect
to
undergraduate
student
deferments
and
would
provide
them
uniformly
to
all
registrants
who
requested
and
qualified
for
such
a
deferment.
these
undergraduate
deferments
would
continue
only
until
a
registrant
had
received
the
baccalaureate
degree,
failed
to
continue
to
pursue
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily
or
reached
the
age
of
24
whichever
occurred
first.
i
submit
there's
no
question
about
the
legislative
intent
here.
now,
the
other
main
problem
of
respondent's
argument
has
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
an
exempt
registrant
as
in
oestereich
is
somehow
outside
the
system,
outside
the
selective
service
system
entirely
and
it
quotes,
a
court
of
appeal’s
decision
anderson
against
hershey
in
support
of
this
rationale.
petitioner
contends
that
an
exempt
student
is
no
more
outside
the
system
than
a
deferred
system
--
than
a
deferred
student.
and
section
6
(k)
of
the
statute
leaves
absolutely
no
doubt
on
this
point
as
does
section
5
of
the
statute
leave
there
a
continuing
references
to
deferred
and
exempt
students.
there
are
no
distinctions
drawn
between
exemptions
and
deferments
with
these
purposes
under
the
statute.
the
regulations,
section
1625.1
state
unconditionally
that
no
classification
is
permanent.
now,
to
take
the
oestereich
situation
and
compare
it
with
the
breen
situation,
we
can
see
this
in
operation
very
clearly.
if
oestereich,
a
divinity
student
had
finished
his
divinity
school
at
the
seminary
and
having
completed
his
school
then
decided
that
he
was
going
to
enter
a
law
school
or
he
then
decided
that
he
was
going
to
drive
a
bus
or
become
a
carpenter,
can
there
be
any
question
at
all
that
he
would
not
be
outside
the
system
simply
because
he
had
a
iv-d
originally?
and
let's
reverse
the
situation.
let's
take
the
case
of
the
petitioner
who
was
attending
the
berklee
school
of
music
and
let's
assume
that
having
concluded
the
berklee
school
of
music
or
even
while
he
was
there,
he
transferred
to
a
divinity
school.
would
he
be
outside
the
system
at
that
point
simply
because
he
had
transferred
to
a
divinity
school?
it's
obvious
under
the
statute
as
well
as
under
the
regulations
that
any
change
in
the
circumstances
of
a
registrant
can
produce
a
change
in
his
classification.
that's
what
the
classification,
regulations
are
all
about
and
that
there
is
clearly
no
person
who
is
within
the
system,
no
registrant
who
is
within
the
system
who
simply
because
he
has
an
exemption
is
outside
the
system.
that
was
never
intended
and
it's
nowhere
to
be
found.
indeed,
it
may
be
said,
now
there
has
been
said
by
several
courts
below
that
both
exempt
and
deferred
registrants
are
outside
the
pool
of
manpower
and
that's
true,
they
are
outside
the
pool
of
manpower
but
that
hardly
places
them
outside
the
system.
this
is
further
--
i
think
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
the
exemption
deferment,
demarcation
line
which
the
government
tries
so
desperately
to
draw
particularly
after
oestereich
is
almost
impossible
to
define
when
examining
the
various
kinds
of
classifications
which
exist
both
under
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
when
one
moves
from
such
classification
is
iv-f
which
is
an
exemption
and
i-y
which
is
an
exemption
and
then
moves
on
i-d
which
is
a
deferment,
there
is
no
logical
order
of
priority,
there
is
no
systematic
attempt
to
say
that
we
have
a
series
of
exemptions
which
are
going
to
be
treated
in
one
fashion
exclusively
a
series
of
deferments
which
are
going
to
be
treated
in
another
fashion
exclusively
and
at
one
is
in
a
higher
order
of
priority,
one
is
in
the
lower
order
of
priority.
indeed,
the
regulations
themselves
show
a
mixture
and
that
mixture
of
exemptions
and
deferments
in
terms
of
persons
who
are
in
the
highest
order
of
priority
at
i-a
down
to
the
lowest
order
of
priority
which
is
i-c.
another,
i
think,
prime
example
to
illustrate
this
point
would
be
in
the
case
of
federal
judges
who
under
the
statute
and
under
the
regulations
have
deferments.
the
federal
judge
is
obviously
appointed
for
life
but
he
only
has
a
deferment.
now,
is
it
going
to
be
suggested
by
the
government
that
a
federal
judge
is
somehow
rather
inside
the
system
but
a
divinity
student
at
the
end
of
a
theological
seminary
is
somehow
rather
outside
the
system,
it
makes
no
sense.
there
is
no
rational
distinction
recognized
by
either
the
statute
or
by
the
regulations
and
i
think
that
the
three
justices
of
this
court
who
filed
their
dissenting
opinion
in
oestereich
has
much
as
said
so
particularly
as
indicated
in
footnote
nine
of
their
opinion.
this
was
also
practically
conceded
by
counsel
for
selective
service
system
in
the
brief
for
the
solicitor
general
filed
in
the
oestereich
case
calling
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
footnote
on
page
68
where
again,
there
was
practically
a
concession
that
you
couldn't
draw
these
fine
distinctions.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
deferment.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that's
a
deferment
(voice
overlap).
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
a
deferment.
that's
correct.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
as
long
as
he
is
vice
president,
he
only
has
a
deferment.
that
would
be
under
classification
iv-b.
that's
only
he
has.
he
has
no
exemption.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that's
true
of
members
of
this
court.
all
the
members
of
the
court
have
our
deferments.
the
gentlemen
are
not
exempted,
at
least
not
specifically
under
iv-b,
that's
the
classification.
now,
the
distinction
i
think
which
needs
to
be
drawn
in
obviously
some
line
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
other
cases
before
this
court
that
needs
to
be
drawn
is
not
between
exemptions
on
the
one
hand
and
deferments
on
the
other
but
rather
between
those
exemptions
and
deferments
which
are
unequivocally
and
unconditionally
granted
by
statute
on
the
one
side
such
as
veterans,
such
as
sole
surviving
sons,
such
as
full
time
students,
elected
officials
and
the
like
where
you
have
exemptions
and
deferments
there
and
those
exemptions
and
deferments
which
are
granted
by
statute
but
which
are
subject
to
findings
of
fact,
which
are
subject
to
exercise
of
judgment
by
local
boards
and
weighing
of
evidence
where
again
you
got
exemptions
and
deferments
such
as
in
the
case
of
iv-f's,
in
the
case
of
conscientious
objectors,
in
the
case
of
dependency
and
hardship
deferments.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
submit
that
the
gabriel
case
itself
is
a
prime
example
to
illustrate
this
point
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
conscientious
objector
which
involves
an
exemption,
if
he
is
entitled
to
conscientious
objective
status
that
would
be
an
exemption
and
yet
you've
got
so
clearly
a
case
where
there's
got
to
be
discretion
exercised
by
the
board
that
has
got
to
be
weighing
of
the
evidence.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
think
that
the
scope
of
his
discretion
would
be
limited
only
to
the
statutory
criteria.
if
the
director
finds
and
that
by
way
of
the
local
board
that
a
student
is
not
pursuing
a
full
time
course
of
instruction
that
might
be
a
factual
determination
or
if
he
finds
that
he
is
not
pursuing
that
course
of
instruction
satisfactorily
which
are
the
statutory
criteria
then
i
would
certainly
say,
there
would
be
a
basis
for
a
weighing,
for
a
judgment,
for
discretionary
act
by
the
local
board
which
may
indeed
be
barred
by
10
(b)
(3)
but
certainly
where
there
are
criteria
totally
irrelevant
to
the
statutory
criteria
such
as
in
the
case
at
bar
where
the
only
basis
for
doing
what
the
board
did
and
this
is
conceded
as
the
turning
over
of
a
registration
certificate
to
a
clergymen
by
way
of
an
expression
of
dissent
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
and
at
that
point
the
selective
service
director
cannot
do
anything
about
taking
away
a
ii-s
classification,
i
would
submit.
the
only
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
so
i
can
reserve
a
little
time
later
on
if
the
court
please
is
that
the
case
is
cited
by
the
government
that
three
court
of
appeals
cases
cited
by
government,
give
it
small
comfort
in
attempting
to
arrange
for
what
is
obviously
a
divorce
of
convenience
as
between
the
exemption
on
the
one
side
and
deferment
on
the
other.
the
kolden
case
which
it
cites
by
dictum
is
in
full
accord
with
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
there
is
clear
and
rather
it's
a
repeated
dictum
indicating
that
the
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
be
a
bar
in
kolden
where
a
ii-s
undergraduate
student,
full
time
undergraduate
student
was
involved.
the
kraus
case
involving
a
iii-a
deferment
is
governed
by
statutory
language
authorizing
not
mandating
but
authorizing
the
president
to
grant
a
deferment
subject
to
certain
specific
conditions
in
6
(h)
(2),
again
not
applicable.
and
as
far
as
anderson
against
hershey
is
concerned,
which
they
cite
in
their
brief
that
is
again
the
rationale
that
an
exemption
is
outside
the
selective
service
system
which
we
have
already
dealt
with.
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
i
think
are
terribly
important
particularly
the
carey
case
which
was
decided
in
the
second
circuit.
it
is
important
because
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision
in
which
two
of
the
three
judges,
and
that
case
ironically
and
perhaps
incongruously
held
that
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
be
a
bar
to
a
review
of
a
denial
of
a
i-s
classification
and
set
forth
that
where
there
is
no
basis
for
withdrawing
it
and
where
there
is
a
statutory
grant,
it
cannot
be
taken
away
by
the
selective
service
system.
and
if
there
is
a
legal
relationship
involved
as
there
was
in
carey
and
whether
there
was
a
statutory
interpretation
to
be
applied
as
there
was
in
that
case,
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
local
board
nor
is
this
a
matter
to
await
a
criminal
prosecution
but
that
it
is
a
matter
which
is
entitled
to
early
judicial
review.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
emanuel
margolis
that
was
subsequent
to
the
oestereich
decision,
yes.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
subsequent
to
the
breen
decision.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
a
different
panel
but
interestingly
enough
of
the
three
judges
on
that
panel,
two
of
them
are
judges
moore
and
friendly
were
in
the
majority
in
breen.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
yes,
it
is.
we
did
not
have
the
citation
at
that
time
because
it
had
not
yet
been
published.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
can
give
it
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
i
can
do
it
later,
your
honor,
i
cannot
locate
it
right
now.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
very
briefly
answerable
to
the
points
that
were
stated
by
mr.
ruckelshaus,
i
am
interested
to
learn
that
he
concedes
that
there
elements
of
punishment
in
what
happened
to
the
petitioner
in
this,
so
i
think
that
as
an
important
concession
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
take
that
in
a
consideration
of
dovetails
with
the
argument
that
--
part
of
the
argument
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
as
well
as
the
argument
on
the
delinquency
regulations
which
we
have
incorporated
from
the
brief
in
gutknecht
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
far
as
the
gutknecht
case
is
concerned;
it's
very
different
from
this
and
one
major
respect.
gutknecht
was
not
reclassified
punitively
which
was
the
case
here
and
therefore,
it's
a
totally
different
factual
situation
but
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
that
because
the
honorable
members
of
this
court
would
be
given
all
the
facts
in
that
case
tomorrow.
as
far
as
the
statement
by
the
government
that
there
has
been
no
effort
to
implement
the
hershey
directive
that
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
this
comes
as
a
complete
shock
to
petitioner
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
agreed
statement
on
appeal
concedes
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
in
this
--
all
the
allegations
to
that
complaint
of
course
are
admitted.
in
terms
of
the
posture
of
the
case
alleges
that
this
action
was
taken
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
said
directive,
the
court
of
appeals
below
had
no
difficulty
at
all
with
that
issue
and
stated
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
and
i
quote
from
it,
the
majority
stated
that
these
actions
of
the
board
were
in
line
with
the
memorandum
and
letter
dated
respectively
october
24
and
october
26,
1967.
so
i
don't
know
how
that
really
can
be
placed
in
issue
at
this
time.
furthermore,
as
far
as
the
pursuit
of
these
kinds
of
processes
and
procedures
of
punitive
reclassification
pursuant
to
the
hershey
directive,
i
recall
a
court
to
an
as
yet
unpublished,
series
of
hearings
before
the
senate
sub-committee
on
administrative
practice
and
procedure
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
were
held
before
or
rather
on
november
3rd,
1969,
they
are
not
yet
as
published
that
i
have
received
copies
of
the
transcript
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
before
that
committee
of
former
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
who
concedes
that
in
fact
this
kind
of
process
and
procedure
pursuant
to
the
hershey
memorandum
and
letter
did
in
fact
take
place.
the
policy
argument
of
litigious
interruption,
i
think,
is
one
that
really
needs
to
be
met
and
i
had
intended
to
meet
it
except
we're
running
out
of
time
but
i
think
this
maybe
the
time.
this
is
something
which
of
course
is
a
policy
argument
that
the
government
has
made
throughout
not
just
in
this
case
but
in
prior
cases
and
i
think
it
was
amply
answered
not
only
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich
with
a
specific
reference
to
it.
but
it's
also
have
been
answered
particularly
well
by
judge
bazelon
in
the
case
of
national
students
association
versus
hershey
in
footnote
17
where
he
points
out
that
in
order
to
really
preclude
a
litigious
interruption,
congress
would
in
fact
have
to
bar
a
post
induction
review
as
well
as
pre-induction
review
by
way
of
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
since
an
invalidation
made
in
a
post
induction
suit
would
have
precisely
the
same
effect
as
if
it
were
made
prior
to
induction.
mr.
emanuel
margolis
your
honor?
mr.
emanuel
margolis
no,
but
i
think
when
the
reference
is
made
to
litigious
interruption,
then
the
policy
is
not
with
reference
to
interruption
of
service,
it's
with
reference
to
the
interruption
of
calling
men
to
service
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
calling
men
into
the
armed
forces.
now,
in
many
of
these
situations,
i
would
submit
in
most
of
these
situations
where
arguments
geared
to
the
law,
geared
to
the
procedures,
geared
to
the
statute
only
are
involved
and
no
factual
determinations
are
involved
would
not
make
more
sense
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
allow
these
matters
to
be
heard
preliminarily
by
a
federal
court
whether
on
a
claim
for
injunction
or
a
declaratory
judgment
or
both,
let
the
matter
be
heard
on
the
basis
of
oral
arguments
and
briefs
at
that
time
and
at
that
point,
the
registrant
will
know
what
his
legal
rights
are,
the
respondents
will
know
what
the
legal
duties
are
of
the
draft
board
and
certainly
there
will
be
no
risk
to
be
run
by
the
registrant
later
on,
and
risking
an
indictment,
and
a
prosecution
and
if
he's
wrong,
of
course
he
is
facing
not
only
the
(inaudible)
of
that
but
possibly
five
years
in
jail
and
a
$10,000
fine.
this
litigious
interruption
argument
i
think
bears
no
real
weight
when
examined
carefully
as
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
was
suggested
in
the
opinion
by
judge
bazelon.
and
i
trust
that
the
court
would
give
this
the
weight
that
it
deserves
which
is
very
little.
thank
you
very
much.
