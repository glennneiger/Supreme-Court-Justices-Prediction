mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
think
in
light
of
the
statement
of
facts
by
the
counsel
for
petitioner,
it
might
be
well
to
state
in
the
government's
opinion
what
this
case
is
not
about.
in
our
opinion,
this
case
is
not
about
the
advisability
of
the
war
in
vietnam,
it's
not
about
the
advisability
of
the
present
selective
service
law.
quite
obviously,
these
are
questions
of
policy
or
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
government.
thirdly,
i
think
that
this
case
is
not
about
free
speech
or
the
challenge
to
free
speech
under
the
hershey
directive.
there
was
a
specific
finding
by
the
court
below
in
this
case
to
which
petitioner
did
not
object
and
which
is
set
out
on
page
four
of
our
appendix,
it’s
finding
of
fact
number
five,
which
states
that
the
board's
actions
were
entirely
by
virtue
of
the
draft
regulations.
on
page
three
in
the
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
in
this
case,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
bottom
of
paragraph
14,
that
the
attest
memorandum
of
decisions
containing
the
following
findings
of
fact
which
are
not
in
dispute
in
the
following
conclusions
of
law.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
finding
in
this
case.
in
the
same
question
and
that
arises
in
the
gutknecht
case
which
will
follow
this
one
and
there
is
also
a
specific
finding
in
the
gutknecht
case
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
acceleration
was
based
on
the
expressions
of
oppositions
of
the
war
in
vietnam.
now
i
think
that
the
claims
of
the
denial
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
in
this
case
cannot
be
based
on
pure
speculation
or
on
what
might
have
been
done.
they
must
be
based
on
the
fact
situation
as
we
find
it
in
this
case
which
i
think
leads
to
a
complete
denial
that
there
was
any
abridgment
of
first
amendment
freedoms
in
this
case.
here,
as
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
stated
in
his
opening
argument,
there
was
not
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
local
draft
boards
to
implement
the
hershey
directive,
in
this
case
applying
the
delinquency
regulations
and
accelerating
mr.
breen,
accelerating
his
induction.
i
think
that
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
while
the
hershey
directive
was
issued
in
october
under
the
statement
of
facts
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
at
the
petitioner
was
declared
delinquent
on
january
8.
and
in
our
appendix,
appendix
b
to
the
brief
of
the
government
on
page
41
is
a
joint
statement
of
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
and
the
director
of
the
selective
service
in
which
it
was
stated
that
lawful
protest
activities
whether
directive
to
the
draft
or
other
national
issues
do
not
subject
registrants
to
acceleration
or
any
other
special
administrative
action
by
the
selective
service
system.
now,
this
statement
is
fully
supported
by
the
present
justice
department
and
we
would
not
be
here
if
the
department
were
the
opinion
that
in
this
instance
that
mr.
breen
was
denied
his
first
amendment
rights
or
that
the
board
below
acted
interrogation
of
those
rights,
that
he
was
accelerated
for
his
views.
if
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
was
brought
in
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
he
violated
one
of
the
regulations,
the
delinquency
regulations
were
applied
to
him
and
because
he
violated
a
regulation
which
provides
that
you
must
have
your
registration
certificate
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
it
was
reported
to
them
apparently
by
the
marshal
or
by
the
--
and
when
he
returned
his
registration
certification
into
the
clergyman
on
november
16,
1967.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
really
can't
recall
exactly
how
did
they
find
that
out?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
anyone
that
violates
a
regulation
of
this
nature
where
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
local
board
would
be
accelerated.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
it's
a
form
of
mixed
expression
and
conduct
and
under
the
cases
in
this
court
where
there
is
a
mixture
and
where
there
is
a
valid
governmental
purpose
to
be
had
in
the
regulation
which
is
violated.
in
this
case,
the
possession
of
his
draft
cards
that
he
cannot
violate
a
law
or
regulation
and
call
it
speech
and
thereby,
exonerate
himself
from
any
sanctions
other
than
law
or
regulation.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
will
get
to
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'll
address
myself
that
now,
if
you
care
to
the
question
of
punishment
as
far
as
it's
concerned
in
this
case
involves
the
--
and
it
also
involves
the
case
as
follows.
as
to
whether
the
delinquency
regulations
are
punishment
and
the
question
that
we
directly
face
is
whether
--
if
they
are
a
punishment
and
say,
he
should
have
been
provided
its
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
under
that.
i
think
there
is
threshold
question
in
this
case
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
but
if
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
it
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
is
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ah
the
--
the
threshold
question
is
the
one
to
which
the
petitioner's
attorney
directed
most
of
his
attention.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
question
of
punishment
will
be
covered
in
great
detail
in
the
next
case
and
i
think
that
if
you
take
the
straight
question
of
punishment
itself
that
probably
there
are
elements
of
punishment
in
what
happened
here
to
the
petitioner
and
there
are
arguments
that
can
be
made
that
it
was
not
a
punishment.
i
think
this
tends
to
obscure
the
underlying
issue
and
that
is
whether
ultimately
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
able
to
be
afforded
his
full
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
and
it
is
our
position
both
in
this
case
in
oestereich
that
what
has
happened
with
10
(b)
(3)
is
that
the
raising
of
those
rights
is
simply
been
delayed.
he
has
not
been
denied
the
right
to
raise
all
of
this
or
have
all
the
right
to
counsel
and
right
to
confrontation
of
witnesses.
this
is
done
when
he
has
refused
to
submit
to
induction
and
has
a
criminal
trial
or
submits
to
induction
and
brings
the
habeas
corpus
to
contest
his
induction.
so
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
punishment,
i
think
is
only
relevant
in
terms
of
whether
he
eventually
receives
his
rights
that
he
claims
he
should
have.
that
the
threshold
question,
of
course,
is
the
question
of
10
(b)
(3),
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
under
section
10
(b)
(3).
it
is
our
contention
that,
that
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
below
was
proper.
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
clearly
prohibits
judicial
review
of
classification
and
processing
by
local
appeal
board
and
that
these
--
the
questions
of
classification
and
processing
can
only
be
brought
up
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
trial
or
by
habeas
corpus.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
oestereich
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
i
think
there
are
some
distinctions
that
can
be
drawn
between
the
deferment
and
exemption
which
are
irrelevant
to
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
these
are
contentions
that
the
section
does
apply
here.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
twofold.
its
first
purpose
is
to
avoid
a
litigious
interruption
with
the
selective
service
process
and
that
i
think
the
congressional
purpose
here
was
not
to
deny
review
but
to
postpone
it.
and
i
think
that
the
selective
service
process
if
it
should
go
on
smoothly,
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
the
purpose
behind
it
must
be
at
least
applied
at
the
situation
as
it
exist
in
deferments
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
can
raise
all
the
defenses
that
he
had
to
his
treatment
at
the
end
of
the
process.
now,
there
is
historical
validity
to
the
finality
provisions
--
or
finality
decision
of
an
appeal
board
and
that
we
have
the
decision
cited
in
our
brief,
falbo
and
estep
which
have
modified
the
decision
in
falbo
which
said
that
all
of
these,
the
defenses
of
the
board
exceeding
its
jurisdiction
by
not
having
any
basis
in
fact
for
its
decision
could
be
brought
up
at
the
criminal
trial.
so
that
i
believe
that
what
has
happened
in
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
not
a
denial
of
review
but
a
postponement
and
that
there
is
historical
validity
for
that
postponement.
i
think
we
can
--
the
second
purpose
of
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
has
is
to
avoid
having
the
courts
becoming
super
draft
boards
and
certainly
that
if
section
10
(b)
(3)
were
not
to
apply
the
deferments
to
anybody
who
is
deferred,
the
courts
would
be
flooded
with
cases
involving
interpretation
of
draft
board
decisions
and
not
only
as
far
as
they
might
be
considered
blatantly
lawless
because
they
were
completely
outside
of
the
manpower
pool
as
the
judge
coffman
suggested
with
the
rationale
that
could
be
applied
to
oestereich
but
also
with
all
kinds
of
rationale
that
might
have
been
applied
to
the
draft
board's
refusal
or
the
draft
board
decision
to
accelerate.
and
now,
if
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
this
is
a
--
that
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congressional
power
and
that
article
iii
section
1
of
the
constitution
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
define
and
limit
jurisdiction
of
the
inferior
courts
of
this
country
and
article
i
section
8
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
raise
and
support
the
armed
forces
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
is
attempting
to
do
in
section
10
(b)
(3).
there
is
a
constitutional
question
raised
by
a
petitioner
as
the
constitutionality
of
section
10
(b)
(3).
it
is
our
position
at
the
outset
that
this
question
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
clark
against
gabriel
that
it
has
been
decided
against
the
petitioner
and
the
court
there
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
constitutional
objection
to
section
10
(b)
(3).
in
oestereich,
the
court
stated
its
construction
10
(b)
(3),
left
it
unimpaired
in
the
normal
operations
of
the
act.
still
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
can
be
considered
to
be
a
serious
one
here.
the
question
of
the
distinction
between
with
this
case
and
oestereich,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
exemptions
and
deferments
and
if
there
is
no
distinction
that
therefore
oestereich
applies,
i
think
is
very
much
for
this
court
today.
i
would
state
that
the
outset,
that
all
circuit
courts
which
have
faced
this
question
since
oestereich
and
have
decided
the
question
in
the
government's
favor,
the
second,
fourth,
sixth
and
eight
circuits
cited
all,
the
cases
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
have
all
decided
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
in
the
first
place,
that
there
is
a
statutory
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
in
section
6
(g)
of
the
selective
service
act,
this
section
involving
the
ministerial
exemption.
that
exemption
is
unconditional,
it
is
in
given
subject
to
the
power
of
the
president
to
adapt
rules
and
regulations
and
providing
for
that
exemption
but
in
a
ii-s
deferment
in
section
6
(h)
(1),
there
is
a
statutory
condition
placed
on
it.
the
deferment
has
provided”
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
provide”.
now,
that
conditional
grant
is
not
in
section
6
(g)
involving
the
exemption,
the
section
6
(h)
(1)
specifically
recognizes
the
delinquency
regulations
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
same
section.
for
the
first
time,
the
delinquency
regulations
are
recognized
as
being
in
existence
by
the
congress
and
as
judge
friendly
stated
on
page
26
of
his
opinion
that
this
was
a
clear
evidence
that
in
the
court
below,
clear
evidence
that
the
congress
did
not
suppose
that
reclassification
pursuant
to
the
delinquency
regulation
would
violate
provisions
of
6
(h)
(1).
it
said
that
congress
has
not
authorized
that
delinquency
regulations,
it
seems
to
me
is
to
ignore
almost
30
years
of
their
existence.
in
the
30
years
of
the
existence
of
the
delinquency
regulations
which
have
essentially
remained
the
same
since
1948,
the
congress
has
amended
the
act
four
times.
either
amended
the
act
by
changing
it
very
greatly
or
by
readapting
basically
the
provisions
that
were
already
there
and
i
just
can't
believe
that
if
a
congress
has
known
of
the
existence
of
regulations
of
this
matter,
this
kind
has
gone
into
their
--
into
the
whole
act
involving
the
delinquency
regulations
of
four
times
over
the
last
28
years
that
we
can
say
in
1969,
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
delinquency
regulations
be
in
effect
if
there
was
no
statutory
authorization
for
those
regulations.
i
just
can't
believe
that
congress
is
so
blind.
i
would
suggest
for
this
court's
analysis
that
judge
coffman's
analysis
in
anderson
against
hershey
of
the
sixth
circuit
case
which
is
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
judge
coffman,
i
think
expresses
very
well
the
analysis
which
we
recommended
to
this
court.
he
said
that
in
the
case
of
an
exemption,
the
congress
has
made
the
decision
that
qualifying
persons
shall
be
beyond
the
pool
of
manpower
available
for
military
purposes.
in
the
case
of
deferment,
the
congress
has
tried
to
set
priorities
to
provide
predictability
and
to
guarantee
equality
of
treatment
but
not
immunity
for
those
within
the
available
pool
of
manpower.
an
exempt
person
is
predetermined
to
be
outside
of
the
system,
a
deferred
person
is
within.
we
deem
this
is
a
significant
line
of
demarcation.
now,
i
do
not
agree
with
statement
made
by
counsel
for
petitioner
that
the
deferred
individual
is
outside
the
pool
of
manpower.
i
think
he
is
inside
the
pool
of
manpower.
he
is
simply
postponed
when
he
shall
have
to
either
be
in
the
pool
that
is
immediately
indictable
under
the
order
of
call
or
if
he
should
for
some
reason,
no
longer
qualify
to
be
in
that
classification
and
i
think
that
in
the
place
of
the
exemption,
the
case
of
oestereich,
since
he
was
outside
--
outside
the
pool,
the
system
simply
didn't
operate
on
him.
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
comply
with
the
regulation.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
he
would
--
the
question
of
permanency
does
not
i
think
put
them
inside
or
outside
the
pool
of
manpower.
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction
and
in
section
6
(g),
it's
an
unconditional
grant
of
an
exemption
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
are
referring
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
discretion
given
to
the
president
to
defer
students
and
in
the
1967
act,
there
was
no
discretion
given.
it
was
made
mandatory.
the
deferment
was
made
mandatory
but
the
deferment
was
not
made
unconditional
and
the
conditions
were
subject
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
provide.
and
in
section
6
(g),
there
is
no
such
condition
that
was
given
and
i
think
this
makes
a
significant
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
i
would
also
submit
that
there
is
a
logical
nexus
here
between
the
whole
gamut
of
the
regulations
and
the
deferred
status
of
the
petitioner.
now,
the
registration,
there
are
good
reasons
why
all
of
these
regulations
exist.
the
registration
itself,
the
filling
--
th
filing
in
--
the
filling
of
a
classification
questionnaire,
the
carrying
of
draft
cards.
all
of
these
things
were
found
to
be
significant
in
united
states
against
o'brien
when
this
court
found
that
the
criminal
statute
against
the
burning
of
a
draft
card.
the
statute
itself
stated
a
legitimate
government
purpose
and
i
think
there
is
a
logical
nexus
between
anybody
within
the
pool
of
manpower
and
all
of
these
regulations
and
i
think
that
it
maybe
admitted
that
single
regulations
may
not
be
indispensable
but
if
the
courts
are
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
trying
to
say
which
regulations
are
indispensable
and
which
are
not.
now,
then
we
are
going
to
have
again
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
frustrated
because
all
of
these
questions
are
going
to
come
before
the
district
courts
below
as
to
whether
the
draft
boards
properly
saw
a
particular
regulation
as
having
a
logical
nexus
with
the
status
of
the
individual
who
was
accelerated
and
i
think
that
this
piecemeal
determination
by
the
courts
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
indispensable
or
logically
connected
and
would
frustrate
purposes
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
serve
no
better
purpose.
in
the
oestereich
decision,
great
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
action
of
a
draft
board
being
blatantly
lawless
and
i
think
that
the
--
what
the
court
meant
there
and
what
mr.
justice
douglas
meant
in
his
decision
was
that
there
was
no
congressional
authorization
for
the
delinquency
regulations
to
apply
to
a
man
once
he
was
exempted.
and
that
since
there
was
no
congressional
authorization,
any
effort
to
apply
them
to
the
individual
who
was
exempt
was
blatantly
lawless.
and
again
in
gabriel
where
the
court
said
that
the
action
would
have
to
flout
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
concurring
opinion
where
the
action
would
have
to
flout
the
law
and
by
that
draft
board
shows
the
reluctance
of
the
court
to
broaden
the
rule
announced
in
oestereich
so
that
10
(b)
(3)
would
apply
at
the
cases
of
deferments.
i
think
there
are
strong
policy
reasons
for
eliminating
oestereich
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief.
and
the
policy
reason
underlying
section
10
(b)
(3)
itself
against
litigious
interruptions
of
the
selective
service
system.
in
the
exempt
category
are
a
very
few
people.
there
are
ministers,
there
are
people
under
19,
there
are
veterans,
reservist,
sole
surviving
sons
and
as
was
mentioned
in
the
section
involving
the
governmental
official
including
federal
judges
and
legislative
officers
but
in
the
deferred
status,
there
are
much
greater
number
of
people.
in
6
(h)
(1)
and
(2)
involving
not
only
students
but
also
of
those
deferred
for
dependency
or
hardship
or
occupational
problems.
all
of
these
--
if
all
these
people
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
bar
of
10
(b)
(3),
it'll
bring
you
a
pre-induction
injunction.
again,
i
believe
the
10
(b)
(3)
itself,
would
be
so
emasculated.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
so
frustrated.
so
that
we
would
virtually
rule
that
out
of
a
--
out
of
any
effectiveness,
whatsoever
and
i
think
that
this
court
would
be
better
to
just
declare
it
unconstitutional
rather
than
to
effectively
frustrate
the
will
of
congress
by
saying
that
the
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
apply
not
only
to
those
who
were
exempt
but
also
to
those
who
were
deferred.
i
think
that
based
on
these
arguments
that
section
--
the
purpose
of
congress
and
then
in
enacting
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
so
clear
to
allow
the
process
to
continue,
to
allow
the
selective
service
process
with
a
minimum
of
interference,
to
raise
an
army
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
point
where
the
man
is
about
to
be
inducted,
where
he
can
raise
all
the
objections
that
he
has.
at
that
point,
the
process
is
essentially
over.
and
he
can
raise
the
objections
to
his
induction
at
that
point
by
submitting
to
criminal
prosecution
or
by
breen
into
the
army
and
submitting
it
on
habeas
corpus.
now,
this
is
a
sound
congressional
purpose
and
that
it
should
not
be
in
any
way
further
emasculated
or
diminished
by
extending
its
non-application
to
the
case
of
those
who
are
deferred.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
black
he
would
have
completes
relief.
he
would
have
relief
by
refusing
to
submit
for
induction
and
subjecting
himself
as
mr.
gutknecht
did
in
the
case
that
follows
to
a
criminal
prosecution
where
he
could
raise
the
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
delinquency
regulations
as
he
seeks
to
do
here
or
he
could
submit
to
induction
and
raise
the
question,
of
all
the
questions
that
he
is
trying
raise
here
in
his
habeas
corpus
case.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved
here.
the
boards
had
nothing
but
to
determine
as
far
as
the
board
was
concerned,
he
clearly
violated
a
regulation.
having
violated
one,
it
was
within
there
discretion
to
apply
the
delinquency
regulations
and
he
did
so.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it
would
not
be
too
late,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
you
have
to
wait
until
he
went
until
he
went
in
and
he
submitted
himself
for
induction.
this
has
not
happened
yet.
he
is
not
even
been
given
an
induction
notice
as
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
think
in
light
of
the
statement
of
facts
by
the
counsel
for
petitioner,
it
might
be
well
to
state
in
the
government's
opinion
what
this
case
is
not
about.
in
our
opinion,
this
case
is
not
about
the
advisability
of
the
war
in
vietnam,
it's
not
about
the
advisability
of
the
present
selective
service
law.
quite
obviously,
these
are
questions
of
policy
or
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
government.
thirdly,
i
think
that
this
case
is
not
about
free
speech
or
the
challenge
to
free
speech
under
the
hershey
directive.
there
was
a
specific
finding
by
the
court
below
in
this
case
to
which
petitioner
did
not
object
and
which
is
set
out
on
page
four
of
our
appendix,
it’s
finding
of
fact
number
five,
which
states
that
the
board's
actions
were
entirely
by
virtue
of
the
draft
regulations.
on
page
three
in
the
statement
of
facts
agreed
to
by
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
in
this
case,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
bottom
of
paragraph
14,
that
the
attest
memorandum
of
decisions
containing
the
following
findings
of
fact
which
are
not
in
dispute
in
the
following
conclusions
of
law.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
finding
in
this
case.
in
the
same
question
and
that
arises
in
the
gutknecht
case
which
will
follow
this
one
and
there
is
also
a
specific
finding
in
the
gutknecht
case
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
acceleration
was
based
on
the
expressions
of
oppositions
of
the
war
in
vietnam.
now
i
think
that
the
claims
of
the
denial
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
in
this
case
cannot
be
based
on
pure
speculation
or
on
what
might
have
been
done.
they
must
be
based
on
the
fact
situation
as
we
find
it
in
this
case
which
i
think
leads
to
a
complete
denial
that
there
was
any
abridgment
of
first
amendment
freedoms
in
this
case.
here,
as
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
stated
in
his
opening
argument,
there
was
not
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
local
draft
boards
to
implement
the
hershey
directive,
in
this
case
applying
the
delinquency
regulations
and
accelerating
mr.
breen,
accelerating
his
induction.
i
think
that
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
while
the
hershey
directive
was
issued
in
october
under
the
statement
of
facts
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
at
the
petitioner
was
declared
delinquent
on
january
8.
and
in
our
appendix,
appendix
b
to
the
brief
of
the
government
on
page
41
is
a
joint
statement
of
attorney
general
ramsey
clark
and
the
director
of
the
selective
service
in
which
it
was
stated
that
lawful
protest
activities
whether
directive
to
the
draft
or
other
national
issues
do
not
subject
registrants
to
acceleration
or
any
other
special
administrative
action
by
the
selective
service
system.
now,
this
statement
is
fully
supported
by
the
present
justice
department
and
we
would
not
be
here
if
the
department
were
the
opinion
that
in
this
instance
that
mr.
breen
was
denied
his
first
amendment
rights
or
that
the
board
below
acted
interrogation
of
those
rights,
that
he
was
accelerated
for
his
views.
if
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
was
brought
in
the
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
he
violated
one
of
the
regulations,
the
delinquency
regulations
were
applied
to
him
and
because
he
violated
a
regulation
which
provides
that
you
must
have
your
registration
certificate
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
it
was
reported
to
them
apparently
by
the
marshal
or
by
the
--
and
when
he
returned
his
registration
certification
into
the
clergyman
on
november
16,
1967.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
really
can't
recall
exactly
how
did
they
find
that
out?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
anyone
that
violates
a
regulation
of
this
nature
where
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
local
board
would
be
accelerated.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
it's
a
form
of
mixed
expression
and
conduct
and
under
the
cases
in
this
court
where
there
is
a
mixture
and
where
there
is
a
valid
governmental
purpose
to
be
had
in
the
regulation
which
is
violated.
in
this
case,
the
possession
of
his
draft
cards
that
he
cannot
violate
a
law
or
regulation
and
call
it
speech
and
thereby,
exonerate
himself
from
any
sanctions
other
than
law
or
regulation.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
will
get
to
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'll
address
myself
that
now,
if
you
care
to
the
question
of
punishment
as
far
as
it's
concerned
in
this
case
involves
the
--
and
it
also
involves
the
case
as
follows.
as
to
whether
the
delinquency
regulations
are
punishment
and
the
question
that
we
directly
face
is
whether
--
if
they
are
a
punishment
and
say,
he
should
have
been
provided
its
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
under
that.
i
think
there
is
threshold
question
in
this
case
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
but
if
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
it
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
is
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ah
the
--
the
threshold
question
is
the
one
to
which
the
petitioner's
attorney
directed
most
of
his
attention.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
question
of
punishment
will
be
covered
in
great
detail
in
the
next
case
and
i
think
that
if
you
take
the
straight
question
of
punishment
itself
that
probably
there
are
elements
of
punishment
in
what
happened
here
to
the
petitioner
and
there
are
arguments
that
can
be
made
that
it
was
not
a
punishment.
i
think
this
tends
to
obscure
the
underlying
issue
and
that
is
whether
ultimately
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
able
to
be
afforded
his
full
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
and
it
is
our
position
both
in
this
case
in
oestereich
that
what
has
happened
with
10
(b)
(3)
is
that
the
raising
of
those
rights
is
simply
been
delayed.
he
has
not
been
denied
the
right
to
raise
all
of
this
or
have
all
the
right
to
counsel
and
right
to
confrontation
of
witnesses.
this
is
done
when
he
has
refused
to
submit
to
induction
and
has
a
criminal
trial
or
submits
to
induction
and
brings
the
habeas
corpus
to
contest
his
induction.
so
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
punishment,
i
think
is
only
relevant
in
terms
of
whether
he
eventually
receives
his
rights
that
he
claims
he
should
have.
that
the
threshold
question,
of
course,
is
the
question
of
10
(b)
(3),
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
under
section
10
(b)
(3).
it
is
our
contention
that,
that
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
below
was
proper.
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
clearly
prohibits
judicial
review
of
classification
and
processing
by
local
appeal
board
and
that
these
--
the
questions
of
classification
and
processing
can
only
be
brought
up
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
trial
or
by
habeas
corpus.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
oestereich
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
i
think
there
are
some
distinctions
that
can
be
drawn
between
the
deferment
and
exemption
which
are
irrelevant
to
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
these
are
contentions
that
the
section
does
apply
here.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
twofold.
its
first
purpose
is
to
avoid
a
litigious
interruption
with
the
selective
service
process
and
that
i
think
the
congressional
purpose
here
was
not
to
deny
review
but
to
postpone
it.
and
i
think
that
the
selective
service
process
if
it
should
go
on
smoothly,
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
the
purpose
behind
it
must
be
at
least
applied
at
the
situation
as
it
exist
in
deferments
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
can
raise
all
the
defenses
that
he
had
to
his
treatment
at
the
end
of
the
process.
now,
there
is
historical
validity
to
the
finality
provisions
--
or
finality
decision
of
an
appeal
board
and
that
we
have
the
decision
cited
in
our
brief,
falbo
and
estep
which
have
modified
the
decision
in
falbo
which
said
that
all
of
these,
the
defenses
of
the
board
exceeding
its
jurisdiction
by
not
having
any
basis
in
fact
for
its
decision
could
be
brought
up
at
the
criminal
trial.
so
that
i
believe
that
what
has
happened
in
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
not
a
denial
of
review
but
a
postponement
and
that
there
is
historical
validity
for
that
postponement.
i
think
we
can
--
the
second
purpose
of
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
has
is
to
avoid
having
the
courts
becoming
super
draft
boards
and
certainly
that
if
section
10
(b)
(3)
were
not
to
apply
the
deferments
to
anybody
who
is
deferred,
the
courts
would
be
flooded
with
cases
involving
interpretation
of
draft
board
decisions
and
not
only
as
far
as
they
might
be
considered
blatantly
lawless
because
they
were
completely
outside
of
the
manpower
pool
as
the
judge
coffman
suggested
with
the
rationale
that
could
be
applied
to
oestereich
but
also
with
all
kinds
of
rationale
that
might
have
been
applied
to
the
draft
board's
refusal
or
the
draft
board
decision
to
accelerate.
and
now,
if
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
this
is
a
--
that
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congressional
power
and
that
article
iii
section
1
of
the
constitution
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
define
and
limit
jurisdiction
of
the
inferior
courts
of
this
country
and
article
i
section
8
that
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
raise
and
support
the
armed
forces
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
is
attempting
to
do
in
section
10
(b)
(3).
there
is
a
constitutional
question
raised
by
a
petitioner
as
the
constitutionality
of
section
10
(b)
(3).
it
is
our
position
at
the
outset
that
this
question
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
clark
against
gabriel
that
it
has
been
decided
against
the
petitioner
and
the
court
there
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
constitutional
objection
to
section
10
(b)
(3).
in
oestereich,
the
court
stated
its
construction
10
(b)
(3),
left
it
unimpaired
in
the
normal
operations
of
the
act.
still
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
can
be
considered
to
be
a
serious
one
here.
the
question
of
the
distinction
between
with
this
case
and
oestereich,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
distinction
that
can
be
made
between
exemptions
and
deferments
and
if
there
is
no
distinction
that
therefore
oestereich
applies,
i
think
is
very
much
for
this
court
today.
i
would
state
that
the
outset,
that
all
circuit
courts
which
have
faced
this
question
since
oestereich
and
have
decided
the
question
in
the
government's
favor,
the
second,
fourth,
sixth
and
eight
circuits
cited
all,
the
cases
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
have
all
decided
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
in
the
first
place,
that
there
is
a
statutory
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
in
section
6
(g)
of
the
selective
service
act,
this
section
involving
the
ministerial
exemption.
that
exemption
is
unconditional,
it
is
in
given
subject
to
the
power
of
the
president
to
adapt
rules
and
regulations
and
providing
for
that
exemption
but
in
a
ii-s
deferment
in
section
6
(h)
(1),
there
is
a
statutory
condition
placed
on
it.
the
deferment
has
provided”
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
provide”.
now,
that
conditional
grant
is
not
in
section
6
(g)
involving
the
exemption,
the
section
6
(h)
(1)
specifically
recognizes
the
delinquency
regulations
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
same
section.
for
the
first
time,
the
delinquency
regulations
are
recognized
as
being
in
existence
by
the
congress
and
as
judge
friendly
stated
on
page
26
of
his
opinion
that
this
was
a
clear
evidence
that
in
the
court
below,
clear
evidence
that
the
congress
did
not
suppose
that
reclassification
pursuant
to
the
delinquency
regulation
would
violate
provisions
of
6
(h)
(1).
it
said
that
congress
has
not
authorized
that
delinquency
regulations,
it
seems
to
me
is
to
ignore
almost
30
years
of
their
existence.
in
the
30
years
of
the
existence
of
the
delinquency
regulations
which
have
essentially
remained
the
same
since
1948,
the
congress
has
amended
the
act
four
times.
either
amended
the
act
by
changing
it
very
greatly
or
by
readapting
basically
the
provisions
that
were
already
there
and
i
just
can't
believe
that
if
a
congress
has
known
of
the
existence
of
regulations
of
this
matter,
this
kind
has
gone
into
their
--
into
the
whole
act
involving
the
delinquency
regulations
of
four
times
over
the
last
28
years
that
we
can
say
in
1969,
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
delinquency
regulations
be
in
effect
if
there
was
no
statutory
authorization
for
those
regulations.
i
just
can't
believe
that
congress
is
so
blind.
i
would
suggest
for
this
court's
analysis
that
judge
coffman's
analysis
in
anderson
against
hershey
of
the
sixth
circuit
case
which
is
cited
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
judge
coffman,
i
think
expresses
very
well
the
analysis
which
we
recommended
to
this
court.
he
said
that
in
the
case
of
an
exemption,
the
congress
has
made
the
decision
that
qualifying
persons
shall
be
beyond
the
pool
of
manpower
available
for
military
purposes.
in
the
case
of
deferment,
the
congress
has
tried
to
set
priorities
to
provide
predictability
and
to
guarantee
equality
of
treatment
but
not
immunity
for
those
within
the
available
pool
of
manpower.
an
exempt
person
is
predetermined
to
be
outside
of
the
system,
a
deferred
person
is
within.
we
deem
this
is
a
significant
line
of
demarcation.
now,
i
do
not
agree
with
statement
made
by
counsel
for
petitioner
that
the
deferred
individual
is
outside
the
pool
of
manpower.
i
think
he
is
inside
the
pool
of
manpower.
he
is
simply
postponed
when
he
shall
have
to
either
be
in
the
pool
that
is
immediately
indictable
under
the
order
of
call
or
if
he
should
for
some
reason,
no
longer
qualify
to
be
in
that
classification
and
i
think
that
in
the
place
of
the
exemption,
the
case
of
oestereich,
since
he
was
outside
--
outside
the
pool,
the
system
simply
didn't
operate
on
him.
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
comply
with
the
regulation.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
he
would
--
the
question
of
permanency
does
not
i
think
put
them
inside
or
outside
the
pool
of
manpower.
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction
and
in
section
6
(g),
it's
an
unconditional
grant
of
an
exemption
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
are
referring
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
discretion
given
to
the
president
to
defer
students
and
in
the
1967
act,
there
was
no
discretion
given.
it
was
made
mandatory.
the
deferment
was
made
mandatory
but
the
deferment
was
not
made
unconditional
and
the
conditions
were
subject
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
president
may
provide.
and
in
section
6
(g),
there
is
no
such
condition
that
was
given
and
i
think
this
makes
a
significant
distinction
between
a
deferment
and
an
exemption.
i
would
also
submit
that
there
is
a
logical
nexus
here
between
the
whole
gamut
of
the
regulations
and
the
deferred
status
of
the
petitioner.
now,
the
registration,
there
are
good
reasons
why
all
of
these
regulations
exist.
the
registration
itself,
the
filling
--
th
filing
in
--
the
filling
of
a
classification
questionnaire,
the
carrying
of
draft
cards.
all
of
these
things
were
found
to
be
significant
in
united
states
against
o'brien
when
this
court
found
that
the
criminal
statute
against
the
burning
of
a
draft
card.
the
statute
itself
stated
a
legitimate
government
purpose
and
i
think
there
is
a
logical
nexus
between
anybody
within
the
pool
of
manpower
and
all
of
these
regulations
and
i
think
that
it
maybe
admitted
that
single
regulations
may
not
be
indispensable
but
if
the
courts
are
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
trying
to
say
which
regulations
are
indispensable
and
which
are
not.
now,
then
we
are
going
to
have
again
the
section
10
(b)
(3)
frustrated
because
all
of
these
questions
are
going
to
come
before
the
district
courts
below
as
to
whether
the
draft
boards
properly
saw
a
particular
regulation
as
having
a
logical
nexus
with
the
status
of
the
individual
who
was
accelerated
and
i
think
that
this
piecemeal
determination
by
the
courts
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
indispensable
or
logically
connected
and
would
frustrate
purposes
of
section
10
(b)
(3)
and
serve
no
better
purpose.
in
the
oestereich
decision,
great
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
action
of
a
draft
board
being
blatantly
lawless
and
i
think
that
the
--
what
the
court
meant
there
and
what
mr.
justice
douglas
meant
in
his
decision
was
that
there
was
no
congressional
authorization
for
the
delinquency
regulations
to
apply
to
a
man
once
he
was
exempted.
and
that
since
there
was
no
congressional
authorization,
any
effort
to
apply
them
to
the
individual
who
was
exempt
was
blatantly
lawless.
and
again
in
gabriel
where
the
court
said
that
the
action
would
have
to
flout
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
concurring
opinion
where
the
action
would
have
to
flout
the
law
and
by
that
draft
board
shows
the
reluctance
of
the
court
to
broaden
the
rule
announced
in
oestereich
so
that
10
(b)
(3)
would
apply
at
the
cases
of
deferments.
i
think
there
are
strong
policy
reasons
for
eliminating
oestereich
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief.
and
the
policy
reason
underlying
section
10
(b)
(3)
itself
against
litigious
interruptions
of
the
selective
service
system.
in
the
exempt
category
are
a
very
few
people.
there
are
ministers,
there
are
people
under
19,
there
are
veterans,
reservist,
sole
surviving
sons
and
as
was
mentioned
in
the
section
involving
the
governmental
official
including
federal
judges
and
legislative
officers
but
in
the
deferred
status,
there
are
much
greater
number
of
people.
in
6
(h)
(1)
and
(2)
involving
not
only
students
but
also
of
those
deferred
for
dependency
or
hardship
or
occupational
problems.
all
of
these
--
if
all
these
people
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
bar
of
10
(b)
(3),
it'll
bring
you
a
pre-induction
injunction.
again,
i
believe
the
10
(b)
(3)
itself,
would
be
so
emasculated.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
so
frustrated.
so
that
we
would
virtually
rule
that
out
of
a
--
out
of
any
effectiveness,
whatsoever
and
i
think
that
this
court
would
be
better
to
just
declare
it
unconstitutional
rather
than
to
effectively
frustrate
the
will
of
congress
by
saying
that
the
10
(b)
(3)
would
not
apply
not
only
to
those
who
were
exempt
but
also
to
those
who
were
deferred.
i
think
that
based
on
these
arguments
that
section
--
the
purpose
of
congress
and
then
in
enacting
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
so
clear
to
allow
the
process
to
continue,
to
allow
the
selective
service
process
with
a
minimum
of
interference,
to
raise
an
army
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
point
where
the
man
is
about
to
be
inducted,
where
he
can
raise
all
the
objections
that
he
has.
at
that
point,
the
process
is
essentially
over.
and
he
can
raise
the
objections
to
his
induction
at
that
point
by
submitting
to
criminal
prosecution
or
by
breen
into
the
army
and
submitting
it
on
habeas
corpus.
now,
this
is
a
sound
congressional
purpose
and
that
it
should
not
be
in
any
way
further
emasculated
or
diminished
by
extending
its
non-application
to
the
case
of
those
who
are
deferred.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
black
he
would
have
completes
relief.
he
would
have
relief
by
refusing
to
submit
for
induction
and
subjecting
himself
as
mr.
gutknecht
did
in
the
case
that
follows
to
a
criminal
prosecution
where
he
could
raise
the
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
delinquency
regulations
as
he
seeks
to
do
here
or
he
could
submit
to
induction
and
raise
the
question,
of
all
the
questions
that
he
is
trying
raise
here
in
his
habeas
corpus
case.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved
here.
the
boards
had
nothing
but
to
determine
as
far
as
the
board
was
concerned,
he
clearly
violated
a
regulation.
having
violated
one,
it
was
within
there
discretion
to
apply
the
delinquency
regulations
and
he
did
so.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it
would
not
be
too
late,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
you
have
to
wait
until
he
went
until
he
went
in
and
he
submitted
himself
for
induction.
this
has
not
happened
yet.
he
is
not
even
been
given
an
induction
notice
as
here.
