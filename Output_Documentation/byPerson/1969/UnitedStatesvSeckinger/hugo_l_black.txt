you

are
you
asking
a
construction
that
would
hold
that,
perhaps
both
parties
are
negligent

the

should
not
be
alarmed

are
you
asking

more

holding?

that

the
question
is
whether
both
parties
are
negligent
but
the
government
shown
not
to
be
and
the
contract
has
shown
that
had
been
defined
though,
that
he
alone
should
be
liable,
which
are
you
arguing?

then
what
do
you
ask?
justice

full

i
guess
if

was
the
most
negligent.

the

hold

an

it
