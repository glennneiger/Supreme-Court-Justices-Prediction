mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
a
standard
clause
in
federal
government
construction
contracts
which
provides
in
pertinent
part
as
follows.
the
contractor,
the
construction
contractor,
shall
be
responsible
for
all
damages
to
persons
or
property
that
occur
as
a
result
of
his
fault
or
negligence
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
the
work.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
firth
circuit
has
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
government's
complaint
for
indemnity
under
this
clause.
holding
what
this
responsibility
clause
makes
--
leaves
the
united
states
solely
liable
for
any
injuries
that
arise
from
concurrent
negligence
on
both
part
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
contractor.
in
other
words,
the
fifth
circuit
has
read
this
clause
is
relieving
the
contractor
of
any
obligation
to
indemnify
the
united
states
unless
the
contractor's
negligence
in
the
sole
and
exclusive
cause
of
injury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though
if
its
--
it
is
the
fifth
circuit
did
treat
it
in
general
as
an
indemnity
clause
same
would
operate
as
an
indemnity
clause,
if
an
only
if
the
contractor
with
the
sole
cause
of
the
injury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
true
that
the
clause
does
say
responsible
not
--
it
doesn't
use
the
word
indemnifying.
now,
i
will
pursue
that
point
a
bit
further
on.
as
i
say,
we
submit
that
this
was
wrong
and
that
the
responsibility
clause
must
be
read
as
shifting
to
the
contractor
as
its
words
say
and
specifically
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
full
responsibility
to
pay
all
of
the
damages
caused
by
its
negligence
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
may
also
have
been
negligent.
certainly,
we
believe
it
was
improper
for
the
courts
below
to
dispose
of
this
case
on
the
pleadings
without
a
trial
in
which
the
various
pertinent
facts
relating
to
the
contractor
relationship
between
the
parties
and
the
facts
of
the
accident
itself
could
be
explored.
the
basic
facts
are
as
follows.
the
seckinger
company
had
a
fixed
price
construction
contract
with
the
navy
department
in
an
amount
of
roughly
$650,000.00
for
the
construction
of
outside
steam
pipes
of
the
paris
island
marine
depot
in
south
carolina.
ernest
branham
was
an
employee
of
seckinger
who
has
a
welder
and
steamfitter.
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
branham
was
working
on
a
steam
transmission
plate
that
is
being
installed
above
ground
across
one
of
the
streets
at
the
base
at
a
height
of
about
16
feet
above
the
street.
a
day
or
two
before,
the
stretch
of
pipe
crossing
the
street
had
been
put
in
place
on
its
supports
by
a
crane.
but
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
branham
and
another
worker
were
making
certain
adjustments
in
the
positioning
of
the
pipe
in
preparation
for
welding
into
the
pieces
of
pipe
on
either
side
of
the
street
to
which
at
least
to
be
connected.
branham
was
working
shortly
before
the
accident
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
other
man
was
working
on
the
other
side.
the
construction
foreman
in
charge
of
job,
who
was
of
course
an
employee
of
seckinger,
noticed
that
the
man
on
the
other
side
was
having
some
difficulty
and
he
directed
branham,
the
employee,
to
go
over
and
help
him.
in
order
to
get
there,
branham
did
not
climb
down
to
the
street
and
walk
across
the
street,
but
instead
walked
across
the
pipe
itself
which
was
about
20
inches
in
diameters.
and
as
he
came
near
to
the
place
where
the
other
man
was
working,
where
he
was
to
help
him,
he
bumped
into
an
uninsulated
power
line
which
was
running
--
which
was
strung
along
poles
the
normal
way
running
parallel
with
the
street
at
the
edge
of
the
--
at
the
sides.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
(inaudible)
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
was
a
government-owned
power
line
which
one
of
the
regular
lines
which
provided
power
into
the
base.
i
believe
it
was
undisputed
in
that
trial
that
this
power
system
covered
about
a
third
of
the
whole
base.
the
pipe
--
the
wire
was
about
four
or
five
feet
above
the
top
of
the
pipe
and
as
i
say
when
branham
got
to
the
other
side
where
he
was
going,
he
bumped
into
the
pipe
and
the
shock
knocked
him
off
the
pipe
and
he
fell
to
the
street
which
was
16
or
17
feet
below
and
he
was
of
course
seriously
injured.
branham
collected
workmen's
compensation
from
seckinger
under
state
law
and
also
being
unable
to
collect
anything
more
from
his
employer,
he
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
south
carolina.
after
a
trial,
that
court
found
that
the
accident
had
been
caused
by
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
awarded
branham
damages
in
the
amount
of
$45,000.00.
specifically,
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
the
united
states
had
been
negligent
in
two
respects.
one
or
the
other
of
which
had
found
it
caused
the
accident.
first,
it
found
that
government's
construction
inspector
who
was
in
general
supervision
of
the
job
was
negligent
in
failing
to
have
the
law
--
the
power
line
de-energized
before
branham
was
sent
to
by
the
foreman
to
work
near.
and
secondly,
the
court
found
that
the
same
inspector
had
negligently
failed
to
warn
branham
of
the
danger
of
the
wire.
the
united
states
in
that
action
in
south
carolina
filed
the
third
party
complaint
against
seckinger
in
which
it
sought
indemnity
under
the
responsibility
clause
that
are
referred
to
saying
that
any
injury
to
branham
was
caused
by
seckinger.
the
contractor's
own
negligence
and
therefore
the
united
states
should
not
bear
the
damages.
the
south
carolina
district
court
dismissed
that
third
party
complaint
without
prejudice
on
the
theory
that
trying
it
in
that
case
would
unduly
complicate
the
proceedings
there.
so
accordingly,
the
united
states
had
to
bring
and
did
bring
a
separate
action,
this
case
against
seckinger.
it
was
unable
to
sue
seckinger
in
connection
with
this
case
in
south
carolina,
so
the
case
comes
here
from
southern
district
of
georgia
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
government's
complaint
in
the
indemnity
suit
like
the
third
party
complaint
that
had
been
dismissed
alleged
that
branham's
injuries
were
caused
the
negligence
of
seckinger's
employees.
in
particular,
tracking
the
findings
of
the
south
carolina
district
court
which
had
held
the
government
liable
the
complaint
alleged
as
follows
as
to
the
failure
to
de-energize
the
power
line,
the
complaint
alleged
that
seckinger,
the
contractor,
was
responsible
for
requesting
that
the
power
be
turned
off
before
it
sent
branham
to
work
near
the
wires
or
else
that
seckinger
should
have
either
put
some
insulation
on
the
wire
itself
or
requested
the
government
to
do
so.
and
as
to
the
second
element
of
negligence
to
the
south
carolina
district
court
had
found,
the
complaint
alleged
that
seckinger
should
not
have
directed
branham
to
work
near
the
wires
and
should
have
prevented
him
from
proceeding
in
a
dangerous
manner.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
$45,000.00,
mr.
justice
harlan.
therefore,
this
complaint
alleged
seckinger's
negligence
was
the
cause
of
the
injuries
to
branham
and
the
contractor
responsibility
clause
made
seckinger
solely
liable
for
them
and
therefore
seckinger
should
indemnify
the
united
states
for
the
damages
that
were
paid.
the
government
was
prepared
to
prove
these
allegations
of
course
of
the
trial,
although
it
never
had
the
chance
to.
it
was
prepared
to
prove
not
only
that
seckinger
was
negligent
and
that
that
negligence
caused
the
accident,
but
also
that
the
circumstances
were
such
that
seckinger
was
primarily
negligent
and
the
government
only
secondarily
so.
if
--
as
the
south
carolina
court
had
held,
the
government
should
have
turned
the
power
off.
the
relationship
between
the
parties
was
such
that
the
government
could
rely
on
seckinger,
the
contractor,
to
inform
you
when
it
was
necessary
to
turn
the
power
off.
in
this
regard,
the
government
would
show
that
seckinger
had
a
full-time
foreman
on
the
job
at
the
time
of
the
accident
as
the
contract
required,
whereas
the
government's
inspector
who
was
charged
only
with
inspection
of
the
performance
under
the
contract
was
concerned
with
not
only
with
this
job
but
with
another
number
of
other
jobs
going
on
at
the
same
time
and
in
fact
it
was
not
present
at
the
site
of
this
job
when
the
accident
occurred,
but
was
somewhere
else
supervising
another
job.
as
to
the
government's
breach
of
its
duty
to
warn
branham
that
the
south
carolina
district
court
have
found,
the
government
would
further
have
relied,
have
been
able
to
have
a
trial
on
its
indemnity
claim
on
the
specific
instructions
that
were
given
sekinger
in
the
contract
to
assure
safety
and
the
specific
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
to
give
some
flavor
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pardon?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
because
the
government
cannot
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
unless
either
one
of
its
agents
is
negligent
and
in
fact
there's
no
authority
under
that
act
for
the
government
even
to
settle
the
case,
unless
the
person
who
authorizes
the
settlement
believes
that
the
government
was
negligent.
and
i
suppose
if
a
non-negligent
government
settled
the
case
and
then
sued
for
indemnity
under
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
circuit
has
given
to
this
clause,
the
person's
suit
can
then
say
the
settlement
was
improper
because
the
government
official
had
no
authority
to
settle
the
case
and
therefore
there's
no
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
this
is
in
fact
has
been
standard
at
least
since
the
late
1930s.
this
clause
is
now
prescribed
actually
in
two
places
in
the
armed
services
procurement
regulations
which
are
issued
by
the
defense
department
and
also
in
the
general
service
agency
administrations
regulations
which
govern,
generally
speaking,
all
government
contracts.
the
--
there's
an
section,
they
both
use
the
same
clause
though
under
separate
change
of
authority.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
brennan
though
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
in
fact
these
clauses
are
written,
i'm
told
by
an
interagency
committee
with
a
good
deal
of
consultation
with
the
industry.
so
that
--
although
they're
prescribed,
there
is
some
of
the
flavor
of
contract
negotiation
that
goes
into
formulating
these
provisions
since
the
industry
is
consulting
and
has
an
opportunity
to
participate.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
say
that's
all
you'd
have
to
do.
i
think
i
could
certainly
draft
a
more
ironclad,
inexorable
indemnity
clause
for
one
thing
you
could
not
use
the
word
indemnity.
you
could
say,
but
it
provides
all
at
the
end
that
this
clause
means
what
it
says
even
if
the
government
itself
is
negligent
but
we
will
submit
that
that
is
not
necessary.
and
as
to
your
initial
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
the
clause
could
be
changed
but
of
course
it's
not
that
simple
of
a
matter
of
some
person
decreeing
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
though,
it's
obviously
as
these
are
the
complicated
bureaucratic
process.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don't
have
figures
on
the
number
of
actual
contracts
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i've
been
told
and
we
say
in
our
petition
that
there
are
some
200
cases
pending
--
that
many
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh,
i'm
sure,
it
certainly
would
be
many
thousands
since
this
covers
all
fixed
price
construction
contracts
that
the
government
are
virtually
all
that
the
government
whether
with
the
defense
department
or
the
rest
of
the
government
is
into.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
are
in
the
district
courts
and
in
fact
this
is
the
only,
so
far
as
i'm
aware
and
i'm
told,
the
only
case
that's
gotten
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
specific
issue.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
have
been
a
fair
number
of
decisions
one
way
or
the
other
most
of
them
unreported
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
has
happened
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
have
to
say
that
this
clause
is
not
until
--
at
least
until
the
60's,
been
used
by
the
government
generally
speaking
as
an
indemnity
clause.
i
think
one
is
probably
that
that
may
seem
strange,
but
i
think
probably,
the
simplest
explanation
for
that
is
that
it
was
not
until
relatively
recent
years
that
employees
who
were
barred
from
suing
their
employers
on
government
contracts
thought
up
the
notion
of
suing
the
government
on
the
theory
that
the
government
was
negligent
and
was
a
handy
third
party.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
1946.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
could
be
done
mr.
justice
black.
of
course
that
could
be
done
in
any
contract
case
as
well.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
--
well,
i
think
you'd
say
in
other
language
you
would
say
--
as
i
would
say
an
argument,
you
would
but
the
various
different
means
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
formulas
of
words
saying
what
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
increasingly
less,
mr.
justice
black.
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
treated
this
clause
and
we
think
erroneously
as
an
insurance
clause.
it
thought
that
the
government
was
basing
its
case
on
the
proposition
that
this
clause
entitled
the
government
to
indemnification
from
a
contractor
even
if
the
contractor
was
utterly
innocent
of
any
negligence.
of
course,
that's
not
the
theory
of
our
case.
the
theory
of
our
case
and
the
allegations
of
our
complaint
are
that
the
seckinger
company
was
negligent,
that
its
negligence
cause
the
accident
and
that
therefore
and
only
therefore,
the
seckinger
company
is
obligated
to
bear
as
the
clause
says
the
responsibility
for
its
own
negligence.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
hope
if
i
can
sir,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
if
the
government
is
not
negligent,
this
case
couldn't
arise
because
the
government
is
subject
to
liability
if
itself
is
not
negligent.
so
that
we
are
necessarily
in
the
situation
where
both
the
government
and
the
contractor
are
negligent.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
say
that
in
any
such
case
that
the
meaning
of
this
clause
is
that
the
contractor
shall
bear
the
full
damages.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
those
and
we
don't
think
that
if
proposition
is
rejected
that
we
are
out
of
court
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
perhaps
a
less
sweeping
rule,
you
could
say
that
at
least
there
shall
be
some
allocation
of
liability
between
the
contractor
and
the
government.
and
of
course
that's
common
place
at
least
where
this
disparate
responsibility
in
the
common
law
itself
are
negligent
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
that
--
that
would
be
a
possible
role,
of
course,
there
is
a
growing
body
of
authority
on
comparative
negligence
where
the
finder
of
fact
does
in
fact
allocate
the
responsibility.
and
of
course
there
is
the
more
traditional
rule
that
where
one
party
is
primarily
negligent
and
the
other
is
only
secondarily,
so
which
is
really
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
the
theory
of
the
government.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
black,
though
as,
of
course
that
could
be
said
and
as
i
suggested
in
any
contract
case
that
if
you
had
drafted
it
better
you
would
have
a
lawsuit
though
you
answer
that
proposition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
has
not
been
changed
so
there
are
factors
there.
i
gather
constantly,
there
are
revisions
of
these
clauses
under
consideration
and
the
department
of
justice
at
least
has
made
a
suggestion
that
we
could
avoid
these
cases
by
more
explicit
language.
that
may
or
may
not
be
so.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
south
carolina.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
workman's
safety,
of
course,
that's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
if
the
united
states
were
otherwise
entitled
to
some
kind
of
indemnity
from
that
he
could
not
set
up
the
south
carolina
workman's
compensation
statute
as
any
kind
of
defense
to
his
liability
to
the
united
states
particularly
under
contract
with
the
government
and
perhaps
even
as
a
matter
of
common
law
indemnity
which
of
course
this
case
does
not
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
have
to
prove
negligence
and
we
have
to
prove
causation
and
perhaps
though
we
think
we
should
not
have
to
prove,
we
might
have
to
prove
the
relative
response.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
we
would
say
that
the
literal
language
of
the
contract
clause
that
the
contractor
shall
be
responsible
for
all
damages
that
occur
as
a
result
of
his
negligence.
we
would
say
as
our
first
position
that
that
automatically
assure
us
full
recovery
if
we
would
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
just
--
i
was
suggesting
that
that
would
be
another
view
that
could
be
taken.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
on
first
on
the
theory
that
the
contract
gives
it
to
us
automatically.
second,
on
theory,
on
the
traditional
common
law
indemnity
theory
that
insofar
as
the
united
states
had
a
duty
to
this
man
it
was
justified
in
relying
on
the
contractor
to
start
the
particular
duties
that
gave
rise
in
the
united
states'
liability.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
did
that
and
first
the
contractor
and
the
contract
itself
says
in
one
of
the
clauses
that
we've
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
that
the
contractor
shall
give
his
personal
superintendents
to
the
work
or
have
a
confident
foreman
or
superintendent
on
the
work
at
all
times
during
progress.
it
is
not
--
it
was
not
in
fact
the
situation
that
any
government
agent
was
on
the
scene
at
the
time
in
this
accident
or
was
expected
to
be
there.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
contractor
under
the
contract
to
give
minute
by
minute
supervision
to
the
work.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
united
states
could
have
but
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
contractor
--
well,
the
contractor
would
have
had
to
ask
the
government
employee
who
was
in
charged
of
the
power
situation
to
turn
it
off,
but
that
in
fact
i
believe
was
what
have
been
done
a
day
or
two
before
when
the
crane
was
operating,
putting
this
pipe
in
when
it
was
clear
that
the
crane
boom
would
be
within
range
of
the
wire
as
then
there
was
a
real
danger
so
that
was
done.
but
basically,
our
proposition
is
that
common
place
that
the
contractor
was
supervising
the
work
and
anything
that
had
to
be
done
either
by
way
of
warning
or
by
having
the
power
turned
off
to
protect
each
man
was
the
contractor's
obligation
at
least
as
regards
to
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
contractor.
in
any
event,
we
think
it's
clear
that
some
of
the
responsibility
must
be
borne
by
the
contractor
in
this
clause.
the
consequence
of
the
fifth
circuit's
view
of
it
is
the
united
states
has
to
pay
the
price
for
the
negligence
of
its
contractor.
they've
gone
so
far
to
protect
the
contractor
from
liability
to
the
united
states
that
they
have
thrown
the
liability
on
the
united
states
but
denying
it
any
opportunity,
whatever
the
relevance
falls
maybe
to
have
indemnity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
would.
i
would
like
to
go
on
for
just
a
minute
more.
i
noticed
i
don't
have
the
light.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you.
i
might
just
review
again.
i
think
there
are
substantial
policy
considerations
that
support
what
we
say
to
be
the
meaning
of
this
clause.
as
i've
suggested,
the
contractor
is
the
person
who
was
in
the
best
position
to
prevent
injuries
of
this
kind.
since
he's
on
the
job
and
has
direct
supervision
over
his
workmen
and
i
would
suggest
that
imposing
this
kind
of
responsibility
on
him
for
his
own
negligence
gives
him
a
desirable
incentive
to
assure
safety
as
the
person
is
best
able
to
assure
it.
and
whatever
policies
there
might
be
in
favor
of
not
shifting
negligence
to
an
innocent
contractor,
we
suggested
that
they
do
not
apply
here
at
all
where
the
whole
theory
of
the
government's
indemnity
claim
is
that
the
contractor
was
negligent
and
in
fact
was
primarily
negligent.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
several
small
matters.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
argue
the
ryan
doctrine
if
we
thought
it
were
necessary
but
i
think
under
the
situation
of
this
case
the
application
of
ryan
principles
would
have
nothing
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
to
answer
strictly,
technically,
accurately
we
have
--
i
would
think
preserved
the
ryan
theory
but
we
do
not
primarily
rely
on
it
because
i
think
anything
that
ryan
would
give
us,
we
say
we
have
explicitly
in
this
clause.
granted
and
the
ryan
line
of
cases
doesn't
in
some
sense
set
a
background
for
our
statement
that
what
we
say
in
this
clause
means
is
not
extraordinary
because
at
least
in
the
ryan
or
whatever
area
ryan
covers,
the
government
contractors
have
been
given
by
implication
what
we
say
here
we
are
entitled
to
by
a
natural
reading
of
the
clause.
mr.
kennedy
has
referred
to
the
absence
of
a
record
in
this
case.
obviously,
the
reason
there
is
in
the
record
is
because
we
haven't
had
the
chance
to
make
one
yet.
the
statements
that
i
have
made
about
the
facts
of
the
accident
are
taken
from
the
findings
made
by
judge
timmerman
in
the
earlier
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
south
carolina
and
we
have
lodged
in
connection
with
this
case
the
record
of
that
case.
and
i
believe
that
everything
i've
said
even
what
i've
said
about
what
we
would
prove
with
due
process
really
just
me
talking
at
this
point
since
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to
make
a
record
on
that.
everything
that
on
that
is
at
least
consistent
and
i
believe
supported
by
testimony
in
the
transcript
of
the
earlier
trial.
as
i
understand
mr.
kennedy's
argument,
it's
primarily
that
this
clause
should
not
be
considered
as
speaking
for
the
matter
of
indemnity
at
all.
of
course
then,
in
that
respect,
he
departs
from
the
view
that
the
fifth
circuit
itself
does.
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
fifth
circuit
regarded
this
as
some
kind
of
indemnity
clause,
it
simply
held
that
it
wasn't
an
indemnity
clause
which
would
extend
to
this
kind
of
case
where
the
government
was
negligent
or
also
negligent
but
i
think
that
fifth
circuit
agrees
with
us
at
least
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
this
is
where
we
look
in
this
contract
if
we
want
to
know
what
kind
of
indemnity
there
is.
as
to
the
historical
origins
of
this
clause,
i
think
it
is,
as
i
understand
the
situation
that
prevailed
prior
to
the
tort
claims
act,
it
is
not
strictly
accurate
to
say
that
the
government
was
never
subjected
to
tort
liability.
i
believe
what
normally
happen
was
that
congress
would
pass
a
private
bill
or
this
has
happened
to
a
number
of
cases
which
in
effect
amounted
to
an
ad
hoc
tort
claims
act,
giving
the
court
of
claims
jurisdictions
to
adjudicate
whether
or
not
the
government
should
be
liable,
so
i
would
think
that
that
kind
of
situation
could
well
have
given
rights
to
a
situation
where
the
government
had
been
held
liable
and
would
want
to
look
somewhere
for
indemnity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
(voice
overlap)
luckily,
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
what
you
said
--
as
i
understand,
the
congress
ordinarily
did
it
through
a
judicial
proceeding.
it
said,
if
the
court
of
claims
determines
that
the
united
states
should
be
liable
then
the
money
will
be
paid.
also
it's
true
that
these
clauses
are
being
as
i've
said
earlier
reconsidered
and
to
some
extent
reworded
from
time
to
time.
this
clause
is
in
fact
now
slightly
different
went
out
materially
from
the
way
it
was
in
1956
when
this
contract
was
signed.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
may
well
be
so,
mr.
chief
justice
but
a
careful
draftsman
i
think
in
a
government
contract
would
at
least
make
some
effort
to
take
that
possibility.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
count
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
i
was
just
trying
to
give
a
little
more
concrete
content
perhaps
to
the
unknown
possibilities
with
a
careful
draftsman.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
a
standard
clause
in
federal
government
construction
contracts
which
provides
in
pertinent
part
as
follows.
the
contractor,
the
construction
contractor,
shall
be
responsible
for
all
damages
to
persons
or
property
that
occur
as
a
result
of
his
fault
or
negligence
in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
the
work.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
firth
circuit
has
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
government's
complaint
for
indemnity
under
this
clause.
holding
what
this
responsibility
clause
makes
--
leaves
the
united
states
solely
liable
for
any
injuries
that
arise
from
concurrent
negligence
on
both
part
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
contractor.
in
other
words,
the
fifth
circuit
has
read
this
clause
is
relieving
the
contractor
of
any
obligation
to
indemnify
the
united
states
unless
the
contractor's
negligence
in
the
sole
and
exclusive
cause
of
injury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
though
if
its
--
it
is
the
fifth
circuit
did
treat
it
in
general
as
an
indemnity
clause
same
would
operate
as
an
indemnity
clause,
if
an
only
if
the
contractor
with
the
sole
cause
of
the
injury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
true
that
the
clause
does
say
responsible
not
--
it
doesn't
use
the
word
indemnifying.
now,
i
will
pursue
that
point
a
bit
further
on.
as
i
say,
we
submit
that
this
was
wrong
and
that
the
responsibility
clause
must
be
read
as
shifting
to
the
contractor
as
its
words
say
and
specifically
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
full
responsibility
to
pay
all
of
the
damages
caused
by
its
negligence
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
may
also
have
been
negligent.
certainly,
we
believe
it
was
improper
for
the
courts
below
to
dispose
of
this
case
on
the
pleadings
without
a
trial
in
which
the
various
pertinent
facts
relating
to
the
contractor
relationship
between
the
parties
and
the
facts
of
the
accident
itself
could
be
explored.
the
basic
facts
are
as
follows.
the
seckinger
company
had
a
fixed
price
construction
contract
with
the
navy
department
in
an
amount
of
roughly
$650,000.00
for
the
construction
of
outside
steam
pipes
of
the
paris
island
marine
depot
in
south
carolina.
ernest
branham
was
an
employee
of
seckinger
who
has
a
welder
and
steamfitter.
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
branham
was
working
on
a
steam
transmission
plate
that
is
being
installed
above
ground
across
one
of
the
streets
at
the
base
at
a
height
of
about
16
feet
above
the
street.
a
day
or
two
before,
the
stretch
of
pipe
crossing
the
street
had
been
put
in
place
on
its
supports
by
a
crane.
but
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
branham
and
another
worker
were
making
certain
adjustments
in
the
positioning
of
the
pipe
in
preparation
for
welding
into
the
pieces
of
pipe
on
either
side
of
the
street
to
which
at
least
to
be
connected.
branham
was
working
shortly
before
the
accident
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
other
man
was
working
on
the
other
side.
the
construction
foreman
in
charge
of
job,
who
was
of
course
an
employee
of
seckinger,
noticed
that
the
man
on
the
other
side
was
having
some
difficulty
and
he
directed
branham,
the
employee,
to
go
over
and
help
him.
in
order
to
get
there,
branham
did
not
climb
down
to
the
street
and
walk
across
the
street,
but
instead
walked
across
the
pipe
itself
which
was
about
20
inches
in
diameters.
and
as
he
came
near
to
the
place
where
the
other
man
was
working,
where
he
was
to
help
him,
he
bumped
into
an
uninsulated
power
line
which
was
running
--
which
was
strung
along
poles
the
normal
way
running
parallel
with
the
street
at
the
edge
of
the
--
at
the
sides.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
(inaudible)
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
was
a
government-owned
power
line
which
one
of
the
regular
lines
which
provided
power
into
the
base.
i
believe
it
was
undisputed
in
that
trial
that
this
power
system
covered
about
a
third
of
the
whole
base.
the
pipe
--
the
wire
was
about
four
or
five
feet
above
the
top
of
the
pipe
and
as
i
say
when
branham
got
to
the
other
side
where
he
was
going,
he
bumped
into
the
pipe
and
the
shock
knocked
him
off
the
pipe
and
he
fell
to
the
street
which
was
16
or
17
feet
below
and
he
was
of
course
seriously
injured.
branham
collected
workmen's
compensation
from
seckinger
under
state
law
and
also
being
unable
to
collect
anything
more
from
his
employer,
he
sued
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
south
carolina.
after
a
trial,
that
court
found
that
the
accident
had
been
caused
by
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
awarded
branham
damages
in
the
amount
of
$45,000.00.
specifically,
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
the
united
states
had
been
negligent
in
two
respects.
one
or
the
other
of
which
had
found
it
caused
the
accident.
first,
it
found
that
government's
construction
inspector
who
was
in
general
supervision
of
the
job
was
negligent
in
failing
to
have
the
law
--
the
power
line
de-energized
before
branham
was
sent
to
by
the
foreman
to
work
near.
and
secondly,
the
court
found
that
the
same
inspector
had
negligently
failed
to
warn
branham
of
the
danger
of
the
wire.
the
united
states
in
that
action
in
south
carolina
filed
the
third
party
complaint
against
seckinger
in
which
it
sought
indemnity
under
the
responsibility
clause
that
are
referred
to
saying
that
any
injury
to
branham
was
caused
by
seckinger.
the
contractor's
own
negligence
and
therefore
the
united
states
should
not
bear
the
damages.
the
south
carolina
district
court
dismissed
that
third
party
complaint
without
prejudice
on
the
theory
that
trying
it
in
that
case
would
unduly
complicate
the
proceedings
there.
so
accordingly,
the
united
states
had
to
bring
and
did
bring
a
separate
action,
this
case
against
seckinger.
it
was
unable
to
sue
seckinger
in
connection
with
this
case
in
south
carolina,
so
the
case
comes
here
from
southern
district
of
georgia
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
government's
complaint
in
the
indemnity
suit
like
the
third
party
complaint
that
had
been
dismissed
alleged
that
branham's
injuries
were
caused
the
negligence
of
seckinger's
employees.
in
particular,
tracking
the
findings
of
the
south
carolina
district
court
which
had
held
the
government
liable
the
complaint
alleged
as
follows
as
to
the
failure
to
de-energize
the
power
line,
the
complaint
alleged
that
seckinger,
the
contractor,
was
responsible
for
requesting
that
the
power
be
turned
off
before
it
sent
branham
to
work
near
the
wires
or
else
that
seckinger
should
have
either
put
some
insulation
on
the
wire
itself
or
requested
the
government
to
do
so.
and
as
to
the
second
element
of
negligence
to
the
south
carolina
district
court
had
found,
the
complaint
alleged
that
seckinger
should
not
have
directed
branham
to
work
near
the
wires
and
should
have
prevented
him
from
proceeding
in
a
dangerous
manner.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
$45,000.00,
mr.
justice
harlan.
therefore,
this
complaint
alleged
seckinger's
negligence
was
the
cause
of
the
injuries
to
branham
and
the
contractor
responsibility
clause
made
seckinger
solely
liable
for
them
and
therefore
seckinger
should
indemnify
the
united
states
for
the
damages
that
were
paid.
the
government
was
prepared
to
prove
these
allegations
of
course
of
the
trial,
although
it
never
had
the
chance
to.
it
was
prepared
to
prove
not
only
that
seckinger
was
negligent
and
that
that
negligence
caused
the
accident,
but
also
that
the
circumstances
were
such
that
seckinger
was
primarily
negligent
and
the
government
only
secondarily
so.
if
--
as
the
south
carolina
court
had
held,
the
government
should
have
turned
the
power
off.
the
relationship
between
the
parties
was
such
that
the
government
could
rely
on
seckinger,
the
contractor,
to
inform
you
when
it
was
necessary
to
turn
the
power
off.
in
this
regard,
the
government
would
show
that
seckinger
had
a
full-time
foreman
on
the
job
at
the
time
of
the
accident
as
the
contract
required,
whereas
the
government's
inspector
who
was
charged
only
with
inspection
of
the
performance
under
the
contract
was
concerned
with
not
only
with
this
job
but
with
another
number
of
other
jobs
going
on
at
the
same
time
and
in
fact
it
was
not
present
at
the
site
of
this
job
when
the
accident
occurred,
but
was
somewhere
else
supervising
another
job.
as
to
the
government's
breach
of
its
duty
to
warn
branham
that
the
south
carolina
district
court
have
found,
the
government
would
further
have
relied,
have
been
able
to
have
a
trial
on
its
indemnity
claim
on
the
specific
instructions
that
were
given
sekinger
in
the
contract
to
assure
safety
and
the
specific
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
to
give
some
flavor
of
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
pardon?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
because
the
government
cannot
be
liable
under
the
tort
claims
act
unless
either
one
of
its
agents
is
negligent
and
in
fact
there's
no
authority
under
that
act
for
the
government
even
to
settle
the
case,
unless
the
person
who
authorizes
the
settlement
believes
that
the
government
was
negligent.
and
i
suppose
if
a
non-negligent
government
settled
the
case
and
then
sued
for
indemnity
under
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
circuit
has
given
to
this
clause,
the
person's
suit
can
then
say
the
settlement
was
improper
because
the
government
official
had
no
authority
to
settle
the
case
and
therefore
there's
no
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
this
is
in
fact
has
been
standard
at
least
since
the
late
1930s.
this
clause
is
now
prescribed
actually
in
two
places
in
the
armed
services
procurement
regulations
which
are
issued
by
the
defense
department
and
also
in
the
general
service
agency
administrations
regulations
which
govern,
generally
speaking,
all
government
contracts.
the
--
there's
an
section,
they
both
use
the
same
clause
though
under
separate
change
of
authority.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
brennan
though
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
in
fact
these
clauses
are
written,
i'm
told
by
an
interagency
committee
with
a
good
deal
of
consultation
with
the
industry.
so
that
--
although
they're
prescribed,
there
is
some
of
the
flavor
of
contract
negotiation
that
goes
into
formulating
these
provisions
since
the
industry
is
consulting
and
has
an
opportunity
to
participate.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
say
that's
all
you'd
have
to
do.
i
think
i
could
certainly
draft
a
more
ironclad,
inexorable
indemnity
clause
for
one
thing
you
could
not
use
the
word
indemnity.
you
could
say,
but
it
provides
all
at
the
end
that
this
clause
means
what
it
says
even
if
the
government
itself
is
negligent
but
we
will
submit
that
that
is
not
necessary.
and
as
to
your
initial
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
the
clause
could
be
changed
but
of
course
it's
not
that
simple
of
a
matter
of
some
person
decreeing
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
though,
it's
obviously
as
these
are
the
complicated
bureaucratic
process.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
don't
have
figures
on
the
number
of
actual
contracts
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i've
been
told
and
we
say
in
our
petition
that
there
are
some
200
cases
pending
--
that
many
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh,
i'm
sure,
it
certainly
would
be
many
thousands
since
this
covers
all
fixed
price
construction
contracts
that
the
government
are
virtually
all
that
the
government
whether
with
the
defense
department
or
the
rest
of
the
government
is
into.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
are
in
the
district
courts
and
in
fact
this
is
the
only,
so
far
as
i'm
aware
and
i'm
told,
the
only
case
that's
gotten
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
specific
issue.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
have
been
a
fair
number
of
decisions
one
way
or
the
other
most
of
them
unreported
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
has
happened
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
have
to
say
that
this
clause
is
not
until
--
at
least
until
the
60's,
been
used
by
the
government
generally
speaking
as
an
indemnity
clause.
i
think
one
is
probably
that
that
may
seem
strange,
but
i
think
probably,
the
simplest
explanation
for
that
is
that
it
was
not
until
relatively
recent
years
that
employees
who
were
barred
from
suing
their
employers
on
government
contracts
thought
up
the
notion
of
suing
the
government
on
the
theory
that
the
government
was
negligent
and
was
a
handy
third
party.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
1946.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
could
be
done
mr.
justice
black.
of
course
that
could
be
done
in
any
contract
case
as
well.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
--
well,
i
think
you'd
say
in
other
language
you
would
say
--
as
i
would
say
an
argument,
you
would
but
the
various
different
means
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
formulas
of
words
saying
what
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
increasingly
less,
mr.
justice
black.
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course,
treated
this
clause
and
we
think
erroneously
as
an
insurance
clause.
it
thought
that
the
government
was
basing
its
case
on
the
proposition
that
this
clause
entitled
the
government
to
indemnification
from
a
contractor
even
if
the
contractor
was
utterly
innocent
of
any
negligence.
of
course,
that's
not
the
theory
of
our
case.
the
theory
of
our
case
and
the
allegations
of
our
complaint
are
that
the
seckinger
company
was
negligent,
that
its
negligence
cause
the
accident
and
that
therefore
and
only
therefore,
the
seckinger
company
is
obligated
to
bear
as
the
clause
says
the
responsibility
for
its
own
negligence.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
hope
if
i
can
sir,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
if
the
government
is
not
negligent,
this
case
couldn't
arise
because
the
government
is
subject
to
liability
if
itself
is
not
negligent.
so
that
we
are
necessarily
in
the
situation
where
both
the
government
and
the
contractor
are
negligent.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
say
that
in
any
such
case
that
the
meaning
of
this
clause
is
that
the
contractor
shall
bear
the
full
damages.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
those
and
we
don't
think
that
if
proposition
is
rejected
that
we
are
out
of
court
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
perhaps
a
less
sweeping
rule,
you
could
say
that
at
least
there
shall
be
some
allocation
of
liability
between
the
contractor
and
the
government.
and
of
course
that's
common
place
at
least
where
this
disparate
responsibility
in
the
common
law
itself
are
negligent
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
that
--
that
would
be
a
possible
role,
of
course,
there
is
a
growing
body
of
authority
on
comparative
negligence
where
the
finder
of
fact
does
in
fact
allocate
the
responsibility.
and
of
course
there
is
the
more
traditional
rule
that
where
one
party
is
primarily
negligent
and
the
other
is
only
secondarily,
so
which
is
really
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
the
theory
of
the
government.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
black,
though
as,
of
course
that
could
be
said
and
as
i
suggested
in
any
contract
case
that
if
you
had
drafted
it
better
you
would
have
a
lawsuit
though
you
answer
that
proposition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
has
not
been
changed
so
there
are
factors
there.
i
gather
constantly,
there
are
revisions
of
these
clauses
under
consideration
and
the
department
of
justice
at
least
has
made
a
suggestion
that
we
could
avoid
these
cases
by
more
explicit
language.
that
may
or
may
not
be
so.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
south
carolina.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
workman's
safety,
of
course,
that's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
if
the
united
states
were
otherwise
entitled
to
some
kind
of
indemnity
from
that
he
could
not
set
up
the
south
carolina
workman's
compensation
statute
as
any
kind
of
defense
to
his
liability
to
the
united
states
particularly
under
contract
with
the
government
and
perhaps
even
as
a
matter
of
common
law
indemnity
which
of
course
this
case
does
not
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
have
to
prove
negligence
and
we
have
to
prove
causation
and
perhaps
though
we
think
we
should
not
have
to
prove,
we
might
have
to
prove
the
relative
response.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
we
would
say
that
the
literal
language
of
the
contract
clause
that
the
contractor
shall
be
responsible
for
all
damages
that
occur
as
a
result
of
his
negligence.
we
would
say
as
our
first
position
that
that
automatically
assure
us
full
recovery
if
we
would
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
just
--
i
was
suggesting
that
that
would
be
another
view
that
could
be
taken.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
on
first
on
the
theory
that
the
contract
gives
it
to
us
automatically.
second,
on
theory,
on
the
traditional
common
law
indemnity
theory
that
insofar
as
the
united
states
had
a
duty
to
this
man
it
was
justified
in
relying
on
the
contractor
to
start
the
particular
duties
that
gave
rise
in
the
united
states'
liability.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
they
did
that
and
first
the
contractor
and
the
contract
itself
says
in
one
of
the
clauses
that
we've
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
that
the
contractor
shall
give
his
personal
superintendents
to
the
work
or
have
a
confident
foreman
or
superintendent
on
the
work
at
all
times
during
progress.
it
is
not
--
it
was
not
in
fact
the
situation
that
any
government
agent
was
on
the
scene
at
the
time
in
this
accident
or
was
expected
to
be
there.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
contractor
under
the
contract
to
give
minute
by
minute
supervision
to
the
work.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
united
states
could
have
but
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
contractor
--
well,
the
contractor
would
have
had
to
ask
the
government
employee
who
was
in
charged
of
the
power
situation
to
turn
it
off,
but
that
in
fact
i
believe
was
what
have
been
done
a
day
or
two
before
when
the
crane
was
operating,
putting
this
pipe
in
when
it
was
clear
that
the
crane
boom
would
be
within
range
of
the
wire
as
then
there
was
a
real
danger
so
that
was
done.
but
basically,
our
proposition
is
that
common
place
that
the
contractor
was
supervising
the
work
and
anything
that
had
to
be
done
either
by
way
of
warning
or
by
having
the
power
turned
off
to
protect
each
man
was
the
contractor's
obligation
at
least
as
regards
to
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
contractor.
in
any
event,
we
think
it's
clear
that
some
of
the
responsibility
must
be
borne
by
the
contractor
in
this
clause.
the
consequence
of
the
fifth
circuit's
view
of
it
is
the
united
states
has
to
pay
the
price
for
the
negligence
of
its
contractor.
they've
gone
so
far
to
protect
the
contractor
from
liability
to
the
united
states
that
they
have
thrown
the
liability
on
the
united
states
but
denying
it
any
opportunity,
whatever
the
relevance
falls
maybe
to
have
indemnity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
would.
i
would
like
to
go
on
for
just
a
minute
more.
i
noticed
i
don't
have
the
light.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you.
i
might
just
review
again.
i
think
there
are
substantial
policy
considerations
that
support
what
we
say
to
be
the
meaning
of
this
clause.
as
i've
suggested,
the
contractor
is
the
person
who
was
in
the
best
position
to
prevent
injuries
of
this
kind.
since
he's
on
the
job
and
has
direct
supervision
over
his
workmen
and
i
would
suggest
that
imposing
this
kind
of
responsibility
on
him
for
his
own
negligence
gives
him
a
desirable
incentive
to
assure
safety
as
the
person
is
best
able
to
assure
it.
and
whatever
policies
there
might
be
in
favor
of
not
shifting
negligence
to
an
innocent
contractor,
we
suggested
that
they
do
not
apply
here
at
all
where
the
whole
theory
of
the
government's
indemnity
claim
is
that
the
contractor
was
negligent
and
in
fact
was
primarily
negligent.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
several
small
matters.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
we
would
be
willing
to
argue
the
ryan
doctrine
if
we
thought
it
were
necessary
but
i
think
under
the
situation
of
this
case
the
application
of
ryan
principles
would
have
nothing
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
to
answer
strictly,
technically,
accurately
we
have
--
i
would
think
preserved
the
ryan
theory
but
we
do
not
primarily
rely
on
it
because
i
think
anything
that
ryan
would
give
us,
we
say
we
have
explicitly
in
this
clause.
granted
and
the
ryan
line
of
cases
doesn't
in
some
sense
set
a
background
for
our
statement
that
what
we
say
in
this
clause
means
is
not
extraordinary
because
at
least
in
the
ryan
or
whatever
area
ryan
covers,
the
government
contractors
have
been
given
by
implication
what
we
say
here
we
are
entitled
to
by
a
natural
reading
of
the
clause.
mr.
kennedy
has
referred
to
the
absence
of
a
record
in
this
case.
obviously,
the
reason
there
is
in
the
record
is
because
we
haven't
had
the
chance
to
make
one
yet.
the
statements
that
i
have
made
about
the
facts
of
the
accident
are
taken
from
the
findings
made
by
judge
timmerman
in
the
earlier
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
south
carolina
and
we
have
lodged
in
connection
with
this
case
the
record
of
that
case.
and
i
believe
that
everything
i've
said
even
what
i've
said
about
what
we
would
prove
with
due
process
really
just
me
talking
at
this
point
since
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to
make
a
record
on
that.
everything
that
on
that
is
at
least
consistent
and
i
believe
supported
by
testimony
in
the
transcript
of
the
earlier
trial.
as
i
understand
mr.
kennedy's
argument,
it's
primarily
that
this
clause
should
not
be
considered
as
speaking
for
the
matter
of
indemnity
at
all.
of
course
then,
in
that
respect,
he
departs
from
the
view
that
the
fifth
circuit
itself
does.
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
fifth
circuit
regarded
this
as
some
kind
of
indemnity
clause,
it
simply
held
that
it
wasn't
an
indemnity
clause
which
would
extend
to
this
kind
of
case
where
the
government
was
negligent
or
also
negligent
but
i
think
that
fifth
circuit
agrees
with
us
at
least
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
this
is
where
we
look
in
this
contract
if
we
want
to
know
what
kind
of
indemnity
there
is.
as
to
the
historical
origins
of
this
clause,
i
think
it
is,
as
i
understand
the
situation
that
prevailed
prior
to
the
tort
claims
act,
it
is
not
strictly
accurate
to
say
that
the
government
was
never
subjected
to
tort
liability.
i
believe
what
normally
happen
was
that
congress
would
pass
a
private
bill
or
this
has
happened
to
a
number
of
cases
which
in
effect
amounted
to
an
ad
hoc
tort
claims
act,
giving
the
court
of
claims
jurisdictions
to
adjudicate
whether
or
not
the
government
should
be
liable,
so
i
would
think
that
that
kind
of
situation
could
well
have
given
rights
to
a
situation
where
the
government
had
been
held
liable
and
would
want
to
look
somewhere
for
indemnity.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
(voice
overlap)
luckily,
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
what
you
said
--
as
i
understand,
the
congress
ordinarily
did
it
through
a
judicial
proceeding.
it
said,
if
the
court
of
claims
determines
that
the
united
states
should
be
liable
then
the
money
will
be
paid.
also
it's
true
that
these
clauses
are
being
as
i've
said
earlier
reconsidered
and
to
some
extent
reworded
from
time
to
time.
this
clause
is
in
fact
now
slightly
different
went
out
materially
from
the
way
it
was
in
1956
when
this
contract
was
signed.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
may
well
be
so,
mr.
chief
justice
but
a
careful
draftsman
i
think
in
a
government
contract
would
at
least
make
some
effort
to
take
that
possibility.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
count
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
i
was
just
trying
to
give
a
little
more
concrete
content
perhaps
to
the
unknown
possibilities
with
a
careful
draftsman.
