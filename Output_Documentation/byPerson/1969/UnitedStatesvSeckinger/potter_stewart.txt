stewart
well,
it
could
be
argued
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
the
200
in
the
district
courts
now?
justice
potter
stewart
because
this
employer,
the
law
allocates
the
responsibility,
the
law
of
south
carolina,
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
the
south
carolina
as
i
suppose
like
every
other
state,
though
i
don't
know
anything
about
this,
makes
these
employer
liable
whether
or
not
he
was
negligent
to
the
employee
under
some
form
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
has
been
paid
and
that
liability
has
been
discharged
by
the
employer
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
matter
of
the
state
law,
the
common
law
indemnity.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
aia,
the
american
institute
of
architects?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kennedy,
i'm
--
i
understand
that
this
clause
has
been
in
hundreds
if
not
thousands
if
not
many,
many
thousands
of
government
contracts
since
the
30s,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
has
been
existing
since
1946,
isn't
there,
aren't
there
--
i'm
amazed
if
there
are
not
many,
many
court
decisions
construing
this
clause
in
this
basic
context
and
are
there
or
are
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
there
any
court
decisions,
district
courts,
courts
of
appeal
or
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
favorably
to
which
side?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
indemnity
to
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
united
states
could
not
have
been
held
liable.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
somewhere
on
these
printed
briefs
or
record,
is
there
--
is
the
context
of
this
clause
apparent,
all
i
have
is
on
page
2
here
in
the
government's
brief
where
they
have
simply
the
clause
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you,
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
get
other
extreme
claim
under
this
language,
wouldn't
it?
you'd
--
likely
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
this
appropriates
money
to
make
--
to
compensate
an
injured
party.
that's
a
voluntary
act.
