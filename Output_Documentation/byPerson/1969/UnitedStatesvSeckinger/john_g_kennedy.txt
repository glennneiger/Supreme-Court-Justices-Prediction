mr.
john
g.
kennedy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
all
of
these
did
start
about
in
1956
when
our
employee
got
hurt
at
the
government
installation
at
paris
island,
a
marine
base.
he
came
in
contact
with
a
government
wire
which
served
a
great
deal
of
the
base
other
than
this
construction
job.
it
helped
train
marines
and
was
not
in
the
province
of
the
contractor
that
turn
on
or
off.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
this
is
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice
and
where
it
comes
from
is
unknown
to
us.
now,
the
government
got
hit
in
the
district
court
of
south
carolina
for
$45,000.00
and
properly
looked
for
someone
else
to
help
pay.
they
went
through
the
contract,
very
think,
very
involved
forwards
and
backwards
and
finally
they
found
a
clause
which
they
thought
might
be
closed.
this
clause
even
had
a
sneaky
title.
it
said,
permits
and
responsibilities
for
work,
etcetera.
it
never
used
the
word
indemnification.
it
never
used
the
word
whole
harmless,
it
said
permanent
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
respectfully
maintain
that
to
doll
up
this
clause
and
make
it
one
of
indemnity,
we
don't
add
the
words
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
really
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it's
the
english
language
for
indemnify.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
be
responsible.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
is
the
way
--
it's
the
way
the
aia
has
done
it
which
might
give
us
some
guide.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
the
responsible
is
limited,
mr.
justice.
indemnify
means
that
if
i,
the
government,
gets
hit
for
negligence.
i
can
then
recover
from
somebody
else.
now,
the
aia
has
recognized
this.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
and
this
contract
is
very
widely
used
and
they
say
in
their
contract
that
the
contract
that
shall
indemnify
and
hold
harmless,
the
owner,
the
government
was
in
the
comparable
position
and
the
architect
and
their
agents
and
employees
from
and
against
old
claims,
damages,
losses
and
expenses
including
attorney's
fees
arising
out
of
resulting
from
the
performance
of
the
work.
so
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
and
it
also
uses
the
word
indemnify.
some
of
your
courts
have
defined
responsible
as
the
ability
to
respond.
not
“will
respond”
but
“i
am
able
to
respond.”
so,
the
definition
of
responsible
is
much
more
limited,
we
find
that
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
your
honor,
if
a
small
amount
at
that
time
that
was
consumed
in
this
case
from
the
government's
standpoint
were
devoted
to
writing
a
clause
originally,
this
case
would
have
never
happened.
i
personally
would
use
the
word
indemnify
as
the
aia
has
used
and
countless
other
contracts
used.
they
hit
the
word
indemnify.
they
think
there
is
magic
in
the
meaning
of
indemnification.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
we
have
--
i
think
we'd
have
much
less
argument
mr.
justice
with
this
particular
problem.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
the
title
of
the
clause
where
it
was
found.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
we
share
your
surprise
and
i
think
only
lately
have
they
started
pushing
it.
now
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
in
the
briefs
in
the
circuit
courts,
you'll
find
a
district
court
decision
out
of
texas
which
construed
this
favorably.
the
government
says
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
to
our
side.
the
government
cites
porello,
when
they
try
to
get
into
the
ryan
doctrine
and
leave
the
narrow
question
of
the
interpretation
of
words
and
go
to
implied
warranty
which
also
is
an
issue
in
this
case
and
porello
had
a
similar
clause
although
it
was
much
longer.
now,
beyond
these
two
cases
neither
side
had
been
able
to
come
up
with
much.
now,
in
that
context
remember
this
clause
was
born
in
its
present
form
in
1938
at
a
time
when
indemnity
by
the
united
states
would
have
been
impossible
because
there
was
no
federal
torts
claim
act.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
right,
because
the
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
exactly,
so
how
in
1950's
fall
when
this
contract
was
drawn.
can
it
get
added
meaning
to
cover
a
situation
which
was
not
in
effect
when
the
present
wording
of
the
contract
was
born?
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes
sir,
they
are
true.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
very
true.
but
the
language
was
born
at
the
time
when
indemnity
was
impossible.
so,
my
point
is,
although
your
point
is
correct,
how
could
the
government
expect
it
to
be
an
indemnity
clause
when
there
was
no
indemnity
at
the
time
they
developed
it?
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
but
it
was
put
in
with
that
abundance
in
1938
when
indemnity
was
possible.
and
if
you
would
like
an
abundance
of
precaution,
you
certainly
use
the
word
indemnify.
now,
the
title
--
the
title
to
this
clause
is
misleading.
the
first
sentence
has
nothing
to
do
with
responsibility.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
indemnity.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject.
only
in
the
second
sentence
of
this
paragraph
that
they
find,
do
they
get
to
the
responsibility
clause
and
then
they
devote
19
words
and
expect
this
to
serve
as
a
real
indemnity
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
i
think
that
on
page
36
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
of
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
--
you'll
find
the
whole
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it's
number
11,
mr.
justice
and
it
says,
its
titled
permits
and
responsibility
for
work.
now,
this
to
us
is
a
little
bit
sneaky
for
an
indemnity
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
sneaky.
nothing
about
indemnity,
nothing
in
the
first
sentence
about
indemnity
then
they
talk
about
responsibility
in
the
second
sentence
and
then
they
have
a
perfect
opportunity
to
say
indemnity.
but
they
leave
the
subject
entirely.
i
see
i
have
a
red
light,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
thank
you
sir.
we
left
off
when
we
were
taking
a
close
look
at
the
clause,
the
clause
that
is
the
focus
and
we're
making
the
point
that
it
had
a
title
which
does
not
say
anything
about
indemnification
and
it
has
a
first
sentence
which
lacks
any
words
of
indemnification
and
we
submit
fall
short
of
being
a
real
indemnity
clause.
the
scope
of
the
paragraph
is
not
indemnity.
the
intention
of
the
paragraph
is
not
indemnity
and
we
feel
that
this
clause
is
not
sufficient
to
require
the
contractor
to
pay
back
what
the
government
has
lost
as
a
result
of
its
negligence.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
well,
and
in
general
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
in
a
general
sense,
we
pay
workmen's
compensation
whether
we
are
liable
or
not.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
the
latter
would
be
closer.
as
a
taxpayer,
i
would
certainly
prefer
for
the
government
to
have
included
an
indemnity
clause,
so
that
the
exchequer
would
not
bill
out
the
entire
$45,000.00
but
we've
got
to
accept
the
clause
as
it
is.
and
the
clause
as
it
is
we
maintain
does
not
provide
for
a
situation
where
the
government
is
negligent.
it's
$45,000.00
negligent
and
wants
to
get
it
back
from
seckinger,
the
contractor.
now,
nothing
in
this
paragraph
says
a
word
about
hold
the
government
on
this.
that
is
found
in
a
lot
of
indemnity
clause.
it's
found
in
a
lot
of
leases
where
the
owner
is
held
harmless
and
if
there
is
negligence,
one
party
fix
it
up
and
pays
the
other
party
back.
this,
we
think,
is
a
basis
for
the
distinction
between
indemnity
and
responsibility.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
says
we'll
indemnify
the
government.
there's
nothing
in
the
heading
that
says
permits
responsibilities
and
indemnity.
how
can
it
be
said
that
this
contractor
when
he
went
and
signed
at
the
place
he
was
supposed
to
sign
and
the
government
contract
intended
to
pay
back
the
government
for
a
$45,000.00
of
their
own
negligence.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
we
will
pay
the
government
each
share
of
damages
in
the
event
the
government
is
held
responsible.
this
would
be
one
more
sentence
which
would
knock
out
argument
in
the
head
but
it's
not
fair.
it's
a
mere
responsibility
clause.
the
government
in
its
brief
prefers
to
call
it
an
indemnity.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
good
approach.
what
does
this
clause
mean?
this
clause
means
probably
three
or
four
things.
if
our
truck
is
going
to
the
job
and
runs
over
somebody,
we're
responsible
for
our
negligence.
if
our
piping
is
defective
which
we
had
to
go
in
and
fix,
we're
responsible
for
the
negligence.
this
clause
becomes
meaningless
and
ineffective
only
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
but
certainly
the
government
had
reason
to
put
it
in
there
in
1938
when
indemnity
was
not
in
existence.
now,
where
the
government
gets
its
forms
or
why
they
put
them
in
there
i
don't
know
but
certainly
those
two
fields
or
situations
that
this
clause
becomes
meaningful
in.
and
it
only
becomes
meaningless
and
has
no
value
when
you
try
to
touch
it
into
a
full-blown
indemnity
clause.
if
you
leave
it
alone,
let
it
protect
our
plumbing,
let
it
protect
our
negligence.
when
we
run
over
a
truck,
we
run
over
a
car,
there's
no
problem.
now,
certainly
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
this
contract
would
be
important.
the
question
has
been
raised,
why
didn't
we
turn
off
the
power?
we
are
a
plumber
on
a
marine
base
and
we
weren't
about
in
as
good
a
position
to
turn
off
the
power
as
i
am
today
to
turn
off
the
lights
in
this
court
room.
we
went
on
there
to
fix
the
plumbing.
we
weren't
in-charge
of
the
base.
nobody
gave
us
command
of
that
base.
we
were
doing
a
plumbing
job.
what
control
did
we
have
over
the
operation
of
the
base
and
also
in
this
context
we
are
really
looking
for
the
intention
of
the
parties.
what
could
we
have
intended
regarding
indemnity
when
we
merely
went
on
that
base
to
do
one
small
operation.
now,
the
government
brings
in
the
ryan
doctrine
and
they
try
to
reinforce
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
it's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
well,
it
would
please
us
if
they
were
not.
we
don't
think
it's
applicable
and
perhaps
they
have
adopted
that
position.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes
sir.
but
it
was
brushed
aside
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
just
briefly
on
the
ryan
doctrine,
ryan
was
the
employee
of
a
stevedore
who
had
the
operation
of
the
whole
ship.
he
was
loading
it.
he
could
have
turned
off
the
electricity.
he's
charged
with
loading
that
ship
right
but
the
ryan
doctrine
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
now,
we
can't
comment
specifically
on
the
number
of
cases
that
are
pending
on
this
particular
clause.
we
are
in
no
position
to
document
the
number.
we
are
in
no
position
to
document
the
amount
that
as
is
at
stake.
but
certainly,
if
contractors
are
required
to
go
on
to
a
government
installation
and
to
indemnify
the
government
for
it's
negligence
that's
going
to
be
a
much
higher
bill
for
government
contracts.
the
government
is
urging
the
position
that
although
that
negligence
was
$45,000.00
worth
and
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict
for
$45,000.00,
we
the
contractors
have
to
pay
him
back.
this
is
a
long
and
hard
burden
for
a
contractor
to
assume.
and
i
don't
know
how
many
or
how
the
dollars
would
work
out
but
certainly
it's
arguable
that
it
would
cost
the
government
more
money
to
require
indemnification
from
this
plumbing
contractors
and
alike
that
go
along
the
government
installations
to
do
their
work
than
it
would
to
redraft
the
clause
and
to
say
in
effect
we
expect
such
and
such.
from
all
of
those
standpoints
the
matter
should
be
considered.
this
contract
also
puts
the
government
in
a
very
involved
position
as
far
as
inspecting
the
work.
the
government
is
as
close
to
the
job
as
the
contractor
and
perhaps
closer.
the
contractor
has
to
have
a
set
of
plans
for
the
government
to
look
at.
the
government
has
an
inspector
that
goes
there
almost
daily,
almost
several
times
a
day.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
went
on
the
base
to
fix
the
plumbing.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
the
plumbing.
we
would
do
an
outside
distribution
system.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
just
a
part
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
part
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
cannot
answer
that
correctly.
i
don't
know.
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
to
show
one
way
or
the
other.
in
this
record
is
the
suit
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
details
of
it
we
do
not
know
and
i
cannot
answer
it
off
the
record
because
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time
it
got
started.
after
all
of
these
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
should
be
affirmed,
they
dismissed
the
government's
petition.
and
the
circuit
court,
judge
brown,
judge
ainsworth,
judge
goldberg
should
be
affirmed
in
their
dismissal
of
the
government's
petition.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
all
of
these
did
start
about
in
1956
when
our
employee
got
hurt
at
the
government
installation
at
paris
island,
a
marine
base.
he
came
in
contact
with
a
government
wire
which
served
a
great
deal
of
the
base
other
than
this
construction
job.
it
helped
train
marines
and
was
not
in
the
province
of
the
contractor
that
turn
on
or
off.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
this
is
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice
and
where
it
comes
from
is
unknown
to
us.
now,
the
government
got
hit
in
the
district
court
of
south
carolina
for
$45,000.00
and
properly
looked
for
someone
else
to
help
pay.
they
went
through
the
contract,
very
think,
very
involved
forwards
and
backwards
and
finally
they
found
a
clause
which
they
thought
might
be
closed.
this
clause
even
had
a
sneaky
title.
it
said,
permits
and
responsibilities
for
work,
etcetera.
it
never
used
the
word
indemnification.
it
never
used
the
word
whole
harmless,
it
said
permanent
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
respectfully
maintain
that
to
doll
up
this
clause
and
make
it
one
of
indemnity,
we
don't
add
the
words
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
really
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it's
the
english
language
for
indemnify.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
be
responsible.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
is
the
way
--
it's
the
way
the
aia
has
done
it
which
might
give
us
some
guide.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
the
responsible
is
limited,
mr.
justice.
indemnify
means
that
if
i,
the
government,
gets
hit
for
negligence.
i
can
then
recover
from
somebody
else.
now,
the
aia
has
recognized
this.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
and
this
contract
is
very
widely
used
and
they
say
in
their
contract
that
the
contract
that
shall
indemnify
and
hold
harmless,
the
owner,
the
government
was
in
the
comparable
position
and
the
architect
and
their
agents
and
employees
from
and
against
old
claims,
damages,
losses
and
expenses
including
attorney's
fees
arising
out
of
resulting
from
the
performance
of
the
work.
so
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
and
it
also
uses
the
word
indemnify.
some
of
your
courts
have
defined
responsible
as
the
ability
to
respond.
not
“will
respond”
but
“i
am
able
to
respond.”
so,
the
definition
of
responsible
is
much
more
limited,
we
find
that
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
your
honor,
if
a
small
amount
at
that
time
that
was
consumed
in
this
case
from
the
government's
standpoint
were
devoted
to
writing
a
clause
originally,
this
case
would
have
never
happened.
i
personally
would
use
the
word
indemnify
as
the
aia
has
used
and
countless
other
contracts
used.
they
hit
the
word
indemnify.
they
think
there
is
magic
in
the
meaning
of
indemnification.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
we
have
--
i
think
we'd
have
much
less
argument
mr.
justice
with
this
particular
problem.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
and
the
title
of
the
clause
where
it
was
found.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
we
share
your
surprise
and
i
think
only
lately
have
they
started
pushing
it.
now
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
in
the
briefs
in
the
circuit
courts,
you'll
find
a
district
court
decision
out
of
texas
which
construed
this
favorably.
the
government
says
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
to
our
side.
the
government
cites
porello,
when
they
try
to
get
into
the
ryan
doctrine
and
leave
the
narrow
question
of
the
interpretation
of
words
and
go
to
implied
warranty
which
also
is
an
issue
in
this
case
and
porello
had
a
similar
clause
although
it
was
much
longer.
now,
beyond
these
two
cases
neither
side
had
been
able
to
come
up
with
much.
now,
in
that
context
remember
this
clause
was
born
in
its
present
form
in
1938
at
a
time
when
indemnity
by
the
united
states
would
have
been
impossible
because
there
was
no
federal
torts
claim
act.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
right,
because
the
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
exactly,
so
how
in
1950's
fall
when
this
contract
was
drawn.
can
it
get
added
meaning
to
cover
a
situation
which
was
not
in
effect
when
the
present
wording
of
the
contract
was
born?
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes
sir,
they
are
true.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
very
true.
but
the
language
was
born
at
the
time
when
indemnity
was
impossible.
so,
my
point
is,
although
your
point
is
correct,
how
could
the
government
expect
it
to
be
an
indemnity
clause
when
there
was
no
indemnity
at
the
time
they
developed
it?
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
but
it
was
put
in
with
that
abundance
in
1938
when
indemnity
was
possible.
and
if
you
would
like
an
abundance
of
precaution,
you
certainly
use
the
word
indemnify.
now,
the
title
--
the
title
to
this
clause
is
misleading.
the
first
sentence
has
nothing
to
do
with
responsibility.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
indemnity.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject.
only
in
the
second
sentence
of
this
paragraph
that
they
find,
do
they
get
to
the
responsibility
clause
and
then
they
devote
19
words
and
expect
this
to
serve
as
a
real
indemnity
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
i
think
that
on
page
36
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
of
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
--
you'll
find
the
whole
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it's
number
11,
mr.
justice
and
it
says,
its
titled
permits
and
responsibility
for
work.
now,
this
to
us
is
a
little
bit
sneaky
for
an
indemnity
clause.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
sneaky.
nothing
about
indemnity,
nothing
in
the
first
sentence
about
indemnity
then
they
talk
about
responsibility
in
the
second
sentence
and
then
they
have
a
perfect
opportunity
to
say
indemnity.
but
they
leave
the
subject
entirely.
i
see
i
have
a
red
light,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
thank
you
sir.
we
left
off
when
we
were
taking
a
close
look
at
the
clause,
the
clause
that
is
the
focus
and
we're
making
the
point
that
it
had
a
title
which
does
not
say
anything
about
indemnification
and
it
has
a
first
sentence
which
lacks
any
words
of
indemnification
and
we
submit
fall
short
of
being
a
real
indemnity
clause.
the
scope
of
the
paragraph
is
not
indemnity.
the
intention
of
the
paragraph
is
not
indemnity
and
we
feel
that
this
clause
is
not
sufficient
to
require
the
contractor
to
pay
back
what
the
government
has
lost
as
a
result
of
its
negligence.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
well,
and
in
general
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
in
a
general
sense,
we
pay
workmen's
compensation
whether
we
are
liable
or
not.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
the
latter
would
be
closer.
as
a
taxpayer,
i
would
certainly
prefer
for
the
government
to
have
included
an
indemnity
clause,
so
that
the
exchequer
would
not
bill
out
the
entire
$45,000.00
but
we've
got
to
accept
the
clause
as
it
is.
and
the
clause
as
it
is
we
maintain
does
not
provide
for
a
situation
where
the
government
is
negligent.
it's
$45,000.00
negligent
and
wants
to
get
it
back
from
seckinger,
the
contractor.
now,
nothing
in
this
paragraph
says
a
word
about
hold
the
government
on
this.
that
is
found
in
a
lot
of
indemnity
clause.
it's
found
in
a
lot
of
leases
where
the
owner
is
held
harmless
and
if
there
is
negligence,
one
party
fix
it
up
and
pays
the
other
party
back.
this,
we
think,
is
a
basis
for
the
distinction
between
indemnity
and
responsibility.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
says
we'll
indemnify
the
government.
there's
nothing
in
the
heading
that
says
permits
responsibilities
and
indemnity.
how
can
it
be
said
that
this
contractor
when
he
went
and
signed
at
the
place
he
was
supposed
to
sign
and
the
government
contract
intended
to
pay
back
the
government
for
a
$45,000.00
of
their
own
negligence.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
we
will
pay
the
government
each
share
of
damages
in
the
event
the
government
is
held
responsible.
this
would
be
one
more
sentence
which
would
knock
out
argument
in
the
head
but
it's
not
fair.
it's
a
mere
responsibility
clause.
the
government
in
its
brief
prefers
to
call
it
an
indemnity.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
good
approach.
what
does
this
clause
mean?
this
clause
means
probably
three
or
four
things.
if
our
truck
is
going
to
the
job
and
runs
over
somebody,
we're
responsible
for
our
negligence.
if
our
piping
is
defective
which
we
had
to
go
in
and
fix,
we're
responsible
for
the
negligence.
this
clause
becomes
meaningless
and
ineffective
only
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
answer
that
but
certainly
the
government
had
reason
to
put
it
in
there
in
1938
when
indemnity
was
not
in
existence.
now,
where
the
government
gets
its
forms
or
why
they
put
them
in
there
i
don't
know
but
certainly
those
two
fields
or
situations
that
this
clause
becomes
meaningful
in.
and
it
only
becomes
meaningless
and
has
no
value
when
you
try
to
touch
it
into
a
full-blown
indemnity
clause.
if
you
leave
it
alone,
let
it
protect
our
plumbing,
let
it
protect
our
negligence.
when
we
run
over
a
truck,
we
run
over
a
car,
there's
no
problem.
now,
certainly
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
this
contract
would
be
important.
the
question
has
been
raised,
why
didn't
we
turn
off
the
power?
we
are
a
plumber
on
a
marine
base
and
we
weren't
about
in
as
good
a
position
to
turn
off
the
power
as
i
am
today
to
turn
off
the
lights
in
this
court
room.
we
went
on
there
to
fix
the
plumbing.
we
weren't
in-charge
of
the
base.
nobody
gave
us
command
of
that
base.
we
were
doing
a
plumbing
job.
what
control
did
we
have
over
the
operation
of
the
base
and
also
in
this
context
we
are
really
looking
for
the
intention
of
the
parties.
what
could
we
have
intended
regarding
indemnity
when
we
merely
went
on
that
base
to
do
one
small
operation.
now,
the
government
brings
in
the
ryan
doctrine
and
they
try
to
reinforce
--
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
it's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
well,
it
would
please
us
if
they
were
not.
we
don't
think
it's
applicable
and
perhaps
they
have
adopted
that
position.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes
sir.
but
it
was
brushed
aside
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
just
briefly
on
the
ryan
doctrine,
ryan
was
the
employee
of
a
stevedore
who
had
the
operation
of
the
whole
ship.
he
was
loading
it.
he
could
have
turned
off
the
electricity.
he's
charged
with
loading
that
ship
right
but
the
ryan
doctrine
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
now,
we
can't
comment
specifically
on
the
number
of
cases
that
are
pending
on
this
particular
clause.
we
are
in
no
position
to
document
the
number.
we
are
in
no
position
to
document
the
amount
that
as
is
at
stake.
but
certainly,
if
contractors
are
required
to
go
on
to
a
government
installation
and
to
indemnify
the
government
for
it's
negligence
that's
going
to
be
a
much
higher
bill
for
government
contracts.
the
government
is
urging
the
position
that
although
that
negligence
was
$45,000.00
worth
and
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict
for
$45,000.00,
we
the
contractors
have
to
pay
him
back.
this
is
a
long
and
hard
burden
for
a
contractor
to
assume.
and
i
don't
know
how
many
or
how
the
dollars
would
work
out
but
certainly
it's
arguable
that
it
would
cost
the
government
more
money
to
require
indemnification
from
this
plumbing
contractors
and
alike
that
go
along
the
government
installations
to
do
their
work
than
it
would
to
redraft
the
clause
and
to
say
in
effect
we
expect
such
and
such.
from
all
of
those
standpoints
the
matter
should
be
considered.
this
contract
also
puts
the
government
in
a
very
involved
position
as
far
as
inspecting
the
work.
the
government
is
as
close
to
the
job
as
the
contractor
and
perhaps
closer.
the
contractor
has
to
have
a
set
of
plans
for
the
government
to
look
at.
the
government
has
an
inspector
that
goes
there
almost
daily,
almost
several
times
a
day.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
we
went
on
the
base
to
fix
the
plumbing.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
the
plumbing.
we
would
do
an
outside
distribution
system.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
just
a
part
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
part
of
it.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kennedy
i
cannot
answer
that
correctly.
i
don't
know.
there's
nothing
in
this
record,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
to
show
one
way
or
the
other.
in
this
record
is
the
suit
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
details
of
it
we
do
not
know
and
i
cannot
answer
it
off
the
record
because
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time
it
got
started.
after
all
of
these
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
should
be
affirmed,
they
dismissed
the
government's
petition.
and
the
circuit
court,
judge
brown,
judge
ainsworth,
judge
goldberg
should
be
affirmed
in
their
dismissal
of
the
government's
petition.
thank
you.
