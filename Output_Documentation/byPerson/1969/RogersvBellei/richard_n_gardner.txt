mr.
richard
n.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
amici
curiae
in
this
case
are
the
american
bar
association
and
american
wives
of
europeans.
the
later
organization
is
a
group
based
in
paris
of
american
women
married
to
european
husbands.
these
women
share
a
common
bond
of
allegiance
to
this
country.
they
organize
american
educational
and
cultural
programs.
and
most
important
of
all,
they
are
concerned
to
protect
the
american
citizenship
of
their
children,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
do
not
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
this
residence
requirement
is
as
he
put
it
this
morning
fair,
rational,
and
sensible.
on
the
contrary,
they
regard
it
as
unfair,
irrational
and
not
sensible.
they
do
not
appear
here
to
vindicate
what
the
solicitor
general
calls
an
unduly
conceptual
approach
rather
they
are
here
to
vindicate
fundamental
human
rights
and
to
eliminate
an
invidious
discrimination
against
a
class
of
american
citizens,
which
works
very
substantial
human
hardship
to
themselves
and
their
children.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
the
right
not
to
have
their
citizenship
withdrawn
once
it
has
been
granted.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
in
the
last
36
years,
since
this
residence
requirement
was
adopted,
the
number
of
americans
living
abroad
has
increased
from
less
than
100,000
to
close
to
2
million.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
this
includes
nearly
1
million
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
military,
servicemen
and
their
dependents,
92,500
us
civilian
government
employees
and
their
dependents
and
approximately
940,000
other
persons.
and
among
these
nearly
2
million
americans
abroad
are
many
thousand
children
whose
citizenship
will
be
affected
by
your
decision
in
this
case.
among
these,
to
give
some
examples
are
the
daughter
of
the
director
of
the
american
library
in
paris,
a
boy
who
is
a
direct
descendant
of
commodore
perry
and
whose
family
has
served
in
the
us
navy
for
generations
going
back
to
the
revolution.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
think
he
is
approximately;
he
is
a
10
or
11
years
of
age.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
but
only
at
a
price
which
we
argue
is
an
excessive
price
in
terms
of
the
hardship
worked
on
the
families,
i
will
seek
to
show
in
a
moment.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
would
not
object
if
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
required
that
these
children
born
abroad
at
the
age
of
21
reaffirmed
their
allegiance
to
this
country
by
oath
at
21.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
affirmed.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
have
them
do
it
in
english.
most
of
them
speak
english.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
want
to
consider
that
further
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
an
affirmation
of
the
citizenship
would
be
appropriate
and
would
not
cause
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
foreign
born
children
do
have
such
knowledge
in
view
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
because
there
are
350
schools
primary
and
secondary
schools
now
all
over
the
world
not
counting
the
schools
maintained
by
the
us
military
establishment.
and
the
american
wives
of
european
husbands
has
conducted
surveys
in
paris
which
indicates
that
the
majority,
the
overwhelming
majority
speak
english
and
are
brought
up
in
an
american
cultural
tradition
in
their
home.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
it
is
such
evidence
that
we
have.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
other
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
no
it
would
not
be.
it
would
be
a
means
of
congress
perhaps
avoiding
any
difficulty
that
might
be
involved
in
dual
nationality
or
other
problems
which
might
be
felt
to
be
caused
by
this.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
--
we
are
claiming
that
any
condition
subsequent
which
takes
away
the
citizenship
without
the
consent
of
the
person
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
suppose.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
concede
the
point.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we’re
making
essentially
two
arguments
mr.
chief
justice.
first
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
there
are
two
possible
arguments
that
could
be
used
to
sustain
our
position;
one
is
that
congress
has
no
power
to
take
away
citizenship
without
the
consent.
if
that
argument
is
the
one
which
this
court
affirms
today
and
we
believe
that
is
what
it
said
in
afroyim,
then
no
conditions
subsequent
even
of
the
kind
that
was
put
to
me
is
possible.
alternatively,
the
court
might
wish
to
go
less
far
and
say
that
if
there
is
a
condition
subsequent,
it
must
be
one
which
bears
directly
on
the
intention
of
the
person
with
respect
to
his
citizenship.
we
claim
the
residence
requirement
is
unreasonable
because
in
schneider,
the
court
said
there,
“residence
is
not
a
badge
of
allegiance.”
in
answer
to
the
question
on
that
ground,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
no
condition
subsequent
would
be
appropriate
even
the
oath
of
allegiance
although
it
would
be
possible
to
distinguish
that
from
the
residence
requirement
in
this
case.
among
the
american
children
that
are
subject
to
this
residence
requirement,
as
the
daughter
of
a
retired
colonel
in
the
us
army,
a
young
lady
who
is
presently
in
california
in
an
attempt
to
comply
with
this
requirement
whose
parents
cannot
join
her
because
her
grandparents
are
ill
in
paris
and
her
father
retired
from
the
army
is
employed
there.
and
finally,
in
this
class
of
persons
affected
by
this
decision
is
a
young
man
who
is
or
rather
three
persons,
three
young
people
who
are
the
great
grandchildren
of
charles
evans
hughes.
so
at
issue
today
are
the
citizenship
of
direct
descendants
of
people
who
helped
build
america,
of
youngsters,
of
value
who
will
contribute
to
the
future
of
america
and
of
children
of
american
citizens
who
have
spent
their
productive
years
in
the
service
of
america.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
no
sir,
i
am
not
informed
on
that.
they
may
have
done,
but
i
am
not
informed.
i
am
informed
by
my
co-counsel
that
there
has
been
attempt
by
some
of
the
members
to
do
that.
i
submit
that
these
foreign-born
children
are
the
victims
of
an
invidious
discrimination,
a
child
of
two
alien
parents
who
happens
to
be
born
in
the
united
states.
during
a
brief
visit
of
those
parents
can
go
back
to
their
native
land,
grow
up
in
a
home
in
which
english
is
not
spoken,
in
a
foreign
home
and
remain
an
american
citizen
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
life
without
any
residence
requirement.
a
child
of
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
but
we
are
claiming
that
this
is
a
discrimination
which
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
it’s
unjustifiable
and
it
seems
to
me
indefensible
that
the
child
of
those
alien
parents
be
considered
an
american
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
a
need
of
residence
here
and
that
the
child
of
a
naturalized
american
parents
can
reside
under
schneider
v.
rusk
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
life
abroad
without
residence
requirement.
but
that
this
class
of
americans
is
subjected
to
this
residence
requirement.
this
seems
to
us
precisely
a
discrimination
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violative
of
due
process
under
bowling
v.
sharpe.
now
this
discrimination
imposes
great
hardship
as
we
have
tried
to
develop
in
our
brief.
because
it
means
that
the
child
can
only
retain
his
or
her
citizenship
by
coming
back
here
either
during
the
early
school
years
which
would
be
harmful
in
educational
terms
and
a
great
expense
with
long
separation
from
family
or
at
the
university
level,
and
we
know
what
the
cost
of
education
are,
this
would
mean
four
or
five
or
more
thousand
dollars
per
year,
or
it
would
mean
giving
up
the
possibility
of
post
graduate
study
or
jobs
or
careers
immediately
after
graduation
from
the
university.
it
is
a
discrimination
that
bears
particularly
heavily
on
middle
and
low
income
families
who
cannot
afford
to
fly
the
mother
back
here
to
have
the
child
born
in
this
country
or
send
the
child
back
for
schooling
for
five
years
in
this
country.
to
give
one
example
only
or
perhaps
two
examples
of
the
unfairness
of
this
provision
that
has
been
brought
to
our
attention.
there
are
cases
where
a
child
was
born
abroad
of
an
american
father
and
an
alien
mother.
the
mother
subsequently
became
naturalized
in
this
country.
the
child
could
not
become
naturalized
because
the
child
was
already
a
citizen
at
birth
and
thus
that
child
is
subject
to
a
disability
to
which
it
would
not
have
been
subject
had
it
become
nationalized
with
the
mother.
another
anomaly
is
that
here
we
have
people
who
have
been
very
--
in
a
number
of
cases
as
in
bellei
case
been
willing
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
and
unconditionally
make
the
supreme
sacrifice
to
their
country
and
yet
they
can
be
told
even
if
they
do
serve
that
they
are
no
longer
citizens
of
this
country.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
military
service.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we
make
the
comment
because
the
government
seeks
to
suggest
that
these
are
person’s
who
have
no
allegiance
to
this
country.
and
i
am
seeking
to
show
that
they
are
not
conditional
citizens,
they
regard
themselves
as
unconditional
citizens,
they
accept
the
burdens
of
citizenship
as
well
as
the
rights
of
citizenship,
and
it
seems
to
us
unjust
after
23
years
of
accepting
those
burdens
as
well
as
those
rights
to
take
the
citizenship
away
from
them.
now,
we
claim
that
this
discrimination
is
unconstitutional,
very
briefly
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
held
in
a
afroyim
v.
rusk
that
congress
has
no
power
to
take
away
the
citizenship
of
an
american
without
his
consent.
and
that
is
our
case
today.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well
in
the
first
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
but
in
the
closing
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
there
in
the
closing
paragraph
of
that
opinion,
it
was
said
“we
hold
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
and
does
protect
every
citizen
of
this
nation
against
a
congressional
forcible
destruction
of
his
citizenship,
whatever
his
creed,
color,
or
race.”
and
we
submit
that
one
cannot
read
afroyim
as
leaving
outside
the
constitutional
protection
as
important
class
of
citizens.
and
there
is
a
second
reason
for
our
submission.
in
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we
would
rely
on
both.
and
we
would
rely
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
afroyim
--
yes
and
indeed
there
is
a
third
argument
which
has
made
in
afroyim
by
this
court
and
that
is
that
congress
has
no
power,
quite
apart
from
the
fourteenth
or
fifth
amendment
to
take
away
citizenship
without
the
consent
of
the
person,
and
we
rely
on
that
too.
now,
the
solicitor
general
seeks
to
save
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
make
the
argument
whether
or
not
he
was
willing
to
enter
the
service
of
his
country,
but
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case,
he
did
and
many
of
these
foreign
born
americans
are
prepared
to
accept
this
obligation.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes,
well,
i
don’t.
it’s
not
a
fundamental
point.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
think
we
would
say
under
our
theory
that
congress
cannot
take
away
citizenship
for
any
reasons
that
that
under
that
line
of
argument,
that
condition
subsequent
would
fail
and
i
think
under
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
there
might
also
be
problems
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
there
are
other
burdens
such
as
subjection
to
judicial
process
under
the
blackmer
case,
paying
of
taxes
and
others.
i
think
there
are
a
whole
collection
of
burdens
here
which
would
be
very
difficult
for
these
foreign
born
americans
for
the
first
23
years
to
avoid.
may
i
deal
very
briefly
with
this
fundamental
question,
which
is
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
that
is
to
say
that
if
it
were
possible
for
the
congress
to
lay
down
a
conditioned
precedent,
it
must
thereby
be
possible
for
the
congress
to
apply
a
condition
subsequent.
in
our
view,
the
difference
is
fundamental.
it
would
be
one
thing
and
would
not
concede
the
reasonableness
of
this
and
it
would
be
one
thing
for
the
congress
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
citizens
but
can
become
citizens
at
age
21
upon
complying
with
residence
requirements.
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
strip
them
of
their
citizenship,
and
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
years,
one
sees
two
fundamental
reasons
for
this;
first,
the
unfairness
of
taking
away
citizenship
once
vested
given
the
willingness
the
fact
that
the
people
have
accepted
for
23
years
rights
and
obligations.
and
second,
the
danger
of
taking
away
the
civil
liberties
of
americans
through
the
back
door
by
involuntary
expatriation.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
distinction
between
the
condition
precedent
and
the
condition
subsequent.
and
finally,
to
please
the
court,
the
second
pillar
of
the
argument
we’re
making
is
that
the
court
held
in
schneider
v.
rusk
that
a
residence
requirement
for
a
naturalized
americans
violated
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
involved
the
discrimination
unjustifiable
and
that
is
the
kind
of
discrimination
which
is
the
case
before
us.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
amici
curiae
in
this
case
are
the
american
bar
association
and
american
wives
of
europeans.
the
later
organization
is
a
group
based
in
paris
of
american
women
married
to
european
husbands.
these
women
share
a
common
bond
of
allegiance
to
this
country.
they
organize
american
educational
and
cultural
programs.
and
most
important
of
all,
they
are
concerned
to
protect
the
american
citizenship
of
their
children,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
do
not
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
this
residence
requirement
is
as
he
put
it
this
morning
fair,
rational,
and
sensible.
on
the
contrary,
they
regard
it
as
unfair,
irrational
and
not
sensible.
they
do
not
appear
here
to
vindicate
what
the
solicitor
general
calls
an
unduly
conceptual
approach
rather
they
are
here
to
vindicate
fundamental
human
rights
and
to
eliminate
an
invidious
discrimination
against
a
class
of
american
citizens,
which
works
very
substantial
human
hardship
to
themselves
and
their
children.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
the
right
not
to
have
their
citizenship
withdrawn
once
it
has
been
granted.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
in
the
last
36
years,
since
this
residence
requirement
was
adopted,
the
number
of
americans
living
abroad
has
increased
from
less
than
100,000
to
close
to
2
million.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
this
includes
nearly
1
million
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
military,
servicemen
and
their
dependents,
92,500
us
civilian
government
employees
and
their
dependents
and
approximately
940,000
other
persons.
and
among
these
nearly
2
million
americans
abroad
are
many
thousand
children
whose
citizenship
will
be
affected
by
your
decision
in
this
case.
among
these,
to
give
some
examples
are
the
daughter
of
the
director
of
the
american
library
in
paris,
a
boy
who
is
a
direct
descendant
of
commodore
perry
and
whose
family
has
served
in
the
us
navy
for
generations
going
back
to
the
revolution.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
think
he
is
approximately;
he
is
a
10
or
11
years
of
age.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
but
only
at
a
price
which
we
argue
is
an
excessive
price
in
terms
of
the
hardship
worked
on
the
families,
i
will
seek
to
show
in
a
moment.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
would
not
object
if
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
required
that
these
children
born
abroad
at
the
age
of
21
reaffirmed
their
allegiance
to
this
country
by
oath
at
21.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
affirmed.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
i
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
have
them
do
it
in
english.
most
of
them
speak
english.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
want
to
consider
that
further
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
an
affirmation
of
the
citizenship
would
be
appropriate
and
would
not
cause
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
foreign
born
children
do
have
such
knowledge
in
view
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
because
there
are
350
schools
primary
and
secondary
schools
now
all
over
the
world
not
counting
the
schools
maintained
by
the
us
military
establishment.
and
the
american
wives
of
european
husbands
has
conducted
surveys
in
paris
which
indicates
that
the
majority,
the
overwhelming
majority
speak
english
and
are
brought
up
in
an
american
cultural
tradition
in
their
home.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
it
is
such
evidence
that
we
have.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
other
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
no
it
would
not
be.
it
would
be
a
means
of
congress
perhaps
avoiding
any
difficulty
that
might
be
involved
in
dual
nationality
or
other
problems
which
might
be
felt
to
be
caused
by
this.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
--
we
are
claiming
that
any
condition
subsequent
which
takes
away
the
citizenship
without
the
consent
of
the
person
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
suppose.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
concede
the
point.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we’re
making
essentially
two
arguments
mr.
chief
justice.
first
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
there
are
two
possible
arguments
that
could
be
used
to
sustain
our
position;
one
is
that
congress
has
no
power
to
take
away
citizenship
without
the
consent.
if
that
argument
is
the
one
which
this
court
affirms
today
and
we
believe
that
is
what
it
said
in
afroyim,
then
no
conditions
subsequent
even
of
the
kind
that
was
put
to
me
is
possible.
alternatively,
the
court
might
wish
to
go
less
far
and
say
that
if
there
is
a
condition
subsequent,
it
must
be
one
which
bears
directly
on
the
intention
of
the
person
with
respect
to
his
citizenship.
we
claim
the
residence
requirement
is
unreasonable
because
in
schneider,
the
court
said
there,
“residence
is
not
a
badge
of
allegiance.”
in
answer
to
the
question
on
that
ground,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
no
condition
subsequent
would
be
appropriate
even
the
oath
of
allegiance
although
it
would
be
possible
to
distinguish
that
from
the
residence
requirement
in
this
case.
among
the
american
children
that
are
subject
to
this
residence
requirement,
as
the
daughter
of
a
retired
colonel
in
the
us
army,
a
young
lady
who
is
presently
in
california
in
an
attempt
to
comply
with
this
requirement
whose
parents
cannot
join
her
because
her
grandparents
are
ill
in
paris
and
her
father
retired
from
the
army
is
employed
there.
and
finally,
in
this
class
of
persons
affected
by
this
decision
is
a
young
man
who
is
or
rather
three
persons,
three
young
people
who
are
the
great
grandchildren
of
charles
evans
hughes.
so
at
issue
today
are
the
citizenship
of
direct
descendants
of
people
who
helped
build
america,
of
youngsters,
of
value
who
will
contribute
to
the
future
of
america
and
of
children
of
american
citizens
who
have
spent
their
productive
years
in
the
service
of
america.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
no
sir,
i
am
not
informed
on
that.
they
may
have
done,
but
i
am
not
informed.
i
am
informed
by
my
co-counsel
that
there
has
been
attempt
by
some
of
the
members
to
do
that.
i
submit
that
these
foreign-born
children
are
the
victims
of
an
invidious
discrimination,
a
child
of
two
alien
parents
who
happens
to
be
born
in
the
united
states.
during
a
brief
visit
of
those
parents
can
go
back
to
their
native
land,
grow
up
in
a
home
in
which
english
is
not
spoken,
in
a
foreign
home
and
remain
an
american
citizen
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
life
without
any
residence
requirement.
a
child
of
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
but
we
are
claiming
that
this
is
a
discrimination
which
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
it’s
unjustifiable
and
it
seems
to
me
indefensible
that
the
child
of
those
alien
parents
be
considered
an
american
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
a
need
of
residence
here
and
that
the
child
of
a
naturalized
american
parents
can
reside
under
schneider
v.
rusk
for
the
rest
of
his
or
her
life
abroad
without
residence
requirement.
but
that
this
class
of
americans
is
subjected
to
this
residence
requirement.
this
seems
to
us
precisely
a
discrimination
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violative
of
due
process
under
bowling
v.
sharpe.
now
this
discrimination
imposes
great
hardship
as
we
have
tried
to
develop
in
our
brief.
because
it
means
that
the
child
can
only
retain
his
or
her
citizenship
by
coming
back
here
either
during
the
early
school
years
which
would
be
harmful
in
educational
terms
and
a
great
expense
with
long
separation
from
family
or
at
the
university
level,
and
we
know
what
the
cost
of
education
are,
this
would
mean
four
or
five
or
more
thousand
dollars
per
year,
or
it
would
mean
giving
up
the
possibility
of
post
graduate
study
or
jobs
or
careers
immediately
after
graduation
from
the
university.
it
is
a
discrimination
that
bears
particularly
heavily
on
middle
and
low
income
families
who
cannot
afford
to
fly
the
mother
back
here
to
have
the
child
born
in
this
country
or
send
the
child
back
for
schooling
for
five
years
in
this
country.
to
give
one
example
only
or
perhaps
two
examples
of
the
unfairness
of
this
provision
that
has
been
brought
to
our
attention.
there
are
cases
where
a
child
was
born
abroad
of
an
american
father
and
an
alien
mother.
the
mother
subsequently
became
naturalized
in
this
country.
the
child
could
not
become
naturalized
because
the
child
was
already
a
citizen
at
birth
and
thus
that
child
is
subject
to
a
disability
to
which
it
would
not
have
been
subject
had
it
become
nationalized
with
the
mother.
another
anomaly
is
that
here
we
have
people
who
have
been
very
--
in
a
number
of
cases
as
in
bellei
case
been
willing
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
and
unconditionally
make
the
supreme
sacrifice
to
their
country
and
yet
they
can
be
told
even
if
they
do
serve
that
they
are
no
longer
citizens
of
this
country.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
military
service.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we
make
the
comment
because
the
government
seeks
to
suggest
that
these
are
person’s
who
have
no
allegiance
to
this
country.
and
i
am
seeking
to
show
that
they
are
not
conditional
citizens,
they
regard
themselves
as
unconditional
citizens,
they
accept
the
burdens
of
citizenship
as
well
as
the
rights
of
citizenship,
and
it
seems
to
us
unjust
after
23
years
of
accepting
those
burdens
as
well
as
those
rights
to
take
the
citizenship
away
from
them.
now,
we
claim
that
this
discrimination
is
unconstitutional,
very
briefly
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
held
in
a
afroyim
v.
rusk
that
congress
has
no
power
to
take
away
the
citizenship
of
an
american
without
his
consent.
and
that
is
our
case
today.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well
in
the
first
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
but
in
the
closing
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
there
in
the
closing
paragraph
of
that
opinion,
it
was
said
“we
hold
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
and
does
protect
every
citizen
of
this
nation
against
a
congressional
forcible
destruction
of
his
citizenship,
whatever
his
creed,
color,
or
race.”
and
we
submit
that
one
cannot
read
afroyim
as
leaving
outside
the
constitutional
protection
as
important
class
of
citizens.
and
there
is
a
second
reason
for
our
submission.
in
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
we
would
rely
on
both.
and
we
would
rely
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
afroyim
--
yes
and
indeed
there
is
a
third
argument
which
has
made
in
afroyim
by
this
court
and
that
is
that
congress
has
no
power,
quite
apart
from
the
fourteenth
or
fifth
amendment
to
take
away
citizenship
without
the
consent
of
the
person,
and
we
rely
on
that
too.
now,
the
solicitor
general
seeks
to
save
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
would
make
the
argument
whether
or
not
he
was
willing
to
enter
the
service
of
his
country,
but
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case,
he
did
and
many
of
these
foreign
born
americans
are
prepared
to
accept
this
obligation.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
yes,
well,
i
don’t.
it’s
not
a
fundamental
point.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
think
we
would
say
under
our
theory
that
congress
cannot
take
away
citizenship
for
any
reasons
that
that
under
that
line
of
argument,
that
condition
subsequent
would
fail
and
i
think
under
the
mendoza-martinez
case,
there
might
also
be
problems
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
well,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
richard
n.
gardner
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
there
are
other
burdens
such
as
subjection
to
judicial
process
under
the
blackmer
case,
paying
of
taxes
and
others.
i
think
there
are
a
whole
collection
of
burdens
here
which
would
be
very
difficult
for
these
foreign
born
americans
for
the
first
23
years
to
avoid.
may
i
deal
very
briefly
with
this
fundamental
question,
which
is
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
that
is
to
say
that
if
it
were
possible
for
the
congress
to
lay
down
a
conditioned
precedent,
it
must
thereby
be
possible
for
the
congress
to
apply
a
condition
subsequent.
in
our
view,
the
difference
is
fundamental.
it
would
be
one
thing
and
would
not
concede
the
reasonableness
of
this
and
it
would
be
one
thing
for
the
congress
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
citizens
but
can
become
citizens
at
age
21
upon
complying
with
residence
requirements.
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
strip
them
of
their
citizenship,
and
reading
the
decisions
of
this
court
over
the
years,
one
sees
two
fundamental
reasons
for
this;
first,
the
unfairness
of
taking
away
citizenship
once
vested
given
the
willingness
the
fact
that
the
people
have
accepted
for
23
years
rights
and
obligations.
and
second,
the
danger
of
taking
away
the
civil
liberties
of
americans
through
the
back
door
by
involuntary
expatriation.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
distinction
between
the
condition
precedent
and
the
condition
subsequent.
and
finally,
to
please
the
court,
the
second
pillar
of
the
argument
we’re
making
is
that
the
court
held
in
schneider
v.
rusk
that
a
residence
requirement
for
a
naturalized
americans
violated
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
involved
the
discrimination
unjustifiable
and
that
is
the
kind
of
discrimination
which
is
the
case
before
us.
