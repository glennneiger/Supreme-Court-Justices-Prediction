mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
addition
to
the
usual
documents
of
this
case,
the
court
should
also
have
before
it
the
briefs,
amici
curiae
in
one
of
which
the
american
bar
association
has
joined.
may
i
spend
just
a
brief
a
moment
on
the
facts?
aldo
mario
bellei's
mother
was
born
and
raised
in
philadelphia
where
she
stayed
until
she
was
24
when
she
married
aldo
mario
bellei's
father
and
moved
within
the
italy.
her
parents
have
remained
in
philadelphia.
on
five
different
occasions,
aldo
mario
bellei
came
to
this
country
to
visit
his
grandparents.
on
the
first
two
such
occasions,
he
came
on
his
mother's
passport.
and
on
the
second
two
such
occasions,
he
came
on
his
own
passport.
the
fifth
occasion,
our
state
department
denied
him
a
passport,
this
is
when
he
wanted
to
come
here
with
his
bride
to
visit
his
grandparents
and
he
did,
but
he
did
that
on
an
italian
passport.
aldo
mario
bellei
has
had
his
own
united
states
passport
as
an
american
citizen
for
a
period
of
12
years.
he
first
got
it
as
you
will
see
from
page
6
of
the
appendix
on
june
27,
1952,
if
you'll
turn
to
page
11,
you
will
find
that
it
was
renewed
from
time
to
time
until
february
11,
1964.
now,
the
government
comes
along
with
the
conditions
subsequently
imposed
and
seeks
to
take
this
way
and
i
think
this
case
presents
the
simple
question,
whether
the
congress
has
the
power
with
reference
to
an
american
citizen
at
birth
to
take
away
that
citizenship
without
his
voluntary
renunciation
and
can
do
that
consistent
with
the
due
process
cause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
what
i
think
the
issue
is
on
this
case.
and
in
answer
to
the
question
that
you
put,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
it
is
the
government's
position
that
two
aliens
coming
over
here,
having
a
child
born
here
and
returning
to
their
own
country
or
the
case
of
a
person's
naturalized
over
here
with
a
minor
child,
that
those
children
have
greater
rights
than
a
person
like
aldo
mario
bellei,
who
by
section
1993
of
revised
statutes
and
as
amended
by
the
nationality
act
of
1934
was
given
american
citizenship
at
birth.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
act
that
schneider
against
ruck
is
precisely
in
point
because
angelika
schneider
never
went
through
naturalization
proceedings.
her
parents
came
over
and
were
naturalized
at
an
act
of
congress
then
said
that
she
was
an
american
citizen.
i
cannot
see
what
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point.
and
then
in
that
case,
it
was
held
at
the
fact
that
angelika
schneider
who
had
citizenship
by
statute,
she
could
go
abroad
to
germany
and
stay
there
and
the
three-year
residence
requirement
was
declared
unconstitutional.
i
submit
the
same
reasoning
that
in
schneider
against
rusk
compelled
that
provision
to
be
held
unconstitutional
compels
the
section
that
was
attacked
and
held
unconstitutional
below
which
is
the
provision
of
the
immigration
of
nationality
act
of
1952,
is
likewise
unconstitutional.
the
provision
at
the
time
that
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born,
required
that
he
come
here
for
five
years,
immediately
previous
to
his
18th
birthday
and
unless
within
six
months
after
the
child's
21st
birthday,
he
or
she
shall
take
both
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
of
america.
now,
that
section
was
repealed
by
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
but
that
repeal
had
in
it
this
proviso
that
the
repeal
shall
not
terminate
nationality
heretofore
lawfully
acquired.
so
you
have
someone
who
has
american
citizenship
at
birth
and
congress
comes
along
in
a
condition
subsequently
enacted
and
says,
he
doesn't
have
it
anymore.
now,
the
government
says,
well,
this
thing
about
coming
here
for
five
years
is
really
a
small
thing,
it
doesn't
mean
anything,
it's
a
great
hardship.
a
child
living
with
his
parents,
it
would
mean,
if
they
wanted
to
give
him
an
education,
they
would
have
to
have
quite
a
few
thousand
dollars
to
send
him
over
here
at
that
period
of
his
life
in
order
to
acquire
it.
it
would
draw
a
distinction
between
those
who
can
afford
to
do
this
and
those
who
can't.
now,
the
government
also
takes
the
position
that
such
a
person
has
no
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states.
well,
i
submit
that
this
country
has
changed
in
the
past
40
years,
where
americans
living
abroad
have
increased
20-fold
from
some
hundred
thousand
a
year
to
two
million
a
year.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they're
residing
abroad,
i
mean
they're
not
just
travelers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
dallas
wrote
a
piece
in
which
he
was
taking
about
the
million
in
europe
to
which
they're
added
a
million
tourists,
i'm
not
talking
about
tourists.
i'm
not
saying
when
you
say
permanently,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
they're
residing
there.
this
is--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they're
non-tourists,
yes.
in
most
of
the
big
cities
of
the
world,
you
have
large
chunks
of
america
today.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
think
about
half
are
military,
yes,
half
of
the
two
million.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
rather
than
worrying
about
having
a
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states,
europeans
are
worrying
that
we're
americanizing
europe.
a
study
was
done,
25
families
with
american
wives,
all
but
two
fathers
spoke
english.
there
were
47
children
there.
26
spoke
english
as
the
primary
language
or
english
and
french
with
equal
of
fluency,
only
five
spoke
french.
i
submit
that
we
should
regard
these
international
children
as
a
valuable
asset
of
this
country.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
this
is
another
thing.
if
a
child
is
born
of
two
american
parents,
then
there
is
no
problem,
but
if
this
court
should
hold
that
this
statute
is
constitutional,
then
another
congress
can
come
along
and
say,
“children
born
of
two
american
parents,
we're
going
to
take
that
citizenship
away
too”
and
i
submit
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
there
were
two
american
parents,
i
mean
if
the
military
abroad
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
this
situation
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
would
have
to
be
ultimately,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
as
almost
as
complicated
as
income
tax
laws.
i
know
this
specific
section
with
which
i'm
dealing
and
i
do
know
that
the
child
born
of
two
american
parents,
there
is
no
problem.
it's
the
child
born
of
one
american
parent
of
which
there's
a
problem
and
in
the
provisions
with
which
i'm
familiar.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
almost
feel
like
consulting
the
opposition.
i
don't
know
[laughter]
well,
let
me
take
mr.
charles
gordon
over
here
who
does
this
all
the
time.
i
almost
say
to
mr.
charles
gordon,
does
he
know
of
an
exception
for
that
situation.
i
don't.
but
in
connection
with
your
honor's
question,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
if
this
statute
is
held
constitutional
then
congress
has
the
follow
some
future
session
that
come
along
and
take
away
the
american
citizenship
of
a
child
born
abroad
of
two
american
parents,
on
the
government's
interpretation
here.
that's
my
point,
that
in
today's
world
of
united
nations
and
i
haven't
emphasized
this
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
should
regard
these
children
as
an
asset.
i
mean,
we
now
have
diplomatic
relations
with
over
100
foreign
countries
where
members
of
more
than
70
international
organizations,
we
give
military
and
economic
assistance
to
over
50
foreign
countries.
our
business
enterprises
have
more
than
a
hundred
billion
dollars
invested
abroad.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
on
a
due
process
question,
i'd
say
yes
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
also
say
this,
i'm
trying
to
meet
the
argument
of
the
government
where
they
think
that
these
children
are
not
an
asset,
that
they're
burden
we
should
get
rid
off
and
they
talk
about
no
meaningful
connection
to
the
united
states.
and
i
would
like
to
counter
that
by
saying
that
this
is
an
asset
that
this
country
should
welcome
rather
than
say
that
they
are
burden.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i'd
say
on
that
i
don't
think
it's
a
rational
thing
for
congress
to
do,
with
reference
to
someone
who
has
american
citizenship
at
birth
to
come
along
with
condition
subsequently
imposed.
in
other
words,
the
aldo
mario
bellei
got
american
citizenship
in
1939
and
he
had
it,
at
l
east
he
had
it
until
1952
when
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
came
along
and
said
that
“well,
now
you
have
got
to
come
here
and
be
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28.”
and
those
early
years
are
the
years
if
he's
in
his
own
family
context
unless
you're
a
child
of
wealthy
parents,
they
can't
afford
to
send
him
over
here
for
education
during
that
period.
this
is
a
year
when
he
goes
to
college.
the
year
when
goes
to
college.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i'd
say
that
if
that's
what
they
have
in
mind,
congress
has
mistaken
in
today's
world
because
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
because
this
is
an
unreasonable
requirement,
it's
an
unreasonable
classification.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
and
my
position
is
that
this
does
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
angelika
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point
and
i
think
the
courts
approach
in
afroyim
against
rusk
is
also
important.
but
as
to
the
arguments
that
are
made
in
the
government
brief
that
these
children
are
a
liability.
i
think
on
the
contrary,
on
the
context
of
today's
world
where
we
make
supersonic
flights
to
europe
now
for
about
six
hours,
and
you
may
have
colonies
on
mars
in
the
future
century
where
you
are
--
where
we
are
interdependent
nations,
i
think
we
should
regard
these
children
as
an
asset.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
you
put
me
a
different
case
when
you
put
it
as
a
condition
preceding,
that's
not
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
the
congress
had
said,
congress
didn't
say
that,
but
if
the
congress
had
said
“these
steps
must
be
taken
before
you
can
become
a
citizen”,
that's
one
thing.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i'd
have
more
trouble
with
that
case.
that
would
be
a
--
if
were
put
as
a
condition
preceding,
i
could
concede
it
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
wouldn't
be
irrational
maybe,
but
that's
not
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
right.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
think
it's
whether
as
condition
to
preceding
or
a
condition
subsequent.
the
congress
had
said
that
these
children,
and
i
may
say
congress
has
long
said
that
a
child
born
of
an
american
father
is
a
citizen
at
birth.
there
hadn't
been
any
problem
about
that
or
was
ever
questioned
one
way
of
the
other
and
then
when
the
statute
was
broadened
to
include
american
mothers,
it
was
then
that
you
got
these
conditions
in
here.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i've
said,
i
distinguished
the
two
cases
and
mr.
justice
white
was
saying
that
--
by
answer
--
i
thought
i
understood
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
white,
but
there
was
no
distinction
between
the
condition
preceding
on
the
condition
subsequent,
i
think
there
is.
and
i
think,
the
congress
could
very
well,
i
mean
i
could
go
along
with
part
of
the
premise,
the
congress
might
have
the
power
to
say
that
a
child
born
abroad
of
an
american
parent
will
not
get
citizenship
unless
they
come
here
for
five
years
as
a
condition
precedent,
but
that
is
what
congress
did
here.
the
congress
gave
the
citizenship,
they
were
some
conditions
subsequent
but
even
those
were
repealed.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes.
that's
a
simple
question
in
this
case
and
congress
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
expatriate
without
consent.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
it
has
to
be
the
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
a
great
feeling
for
the
concept
of
due
process
as
fundamental
fairness.
i
know
that
mr.
justice
black
has
had
a
problem
with
that,
but
the
due
process
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
expounded
it,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
would
now
expound
it
that
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness
or
the
conscience
of
the
time
and
to
my
mind
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes
[laughter]
if
your
honor
please.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
am
prepared
to
take
the
judgment
of
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
great
institutions
of
the
world
to
take
the
minds,
the
trained
minds
of
the
members
of
this
body,
sitting
down
at
any
particular
time
at
a
problem
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
i'll
be
glad
to
abide,
but
i'll
go
one
step
further.
with
that
same
concept,
and
the
concept
of
this
country
as
a
maturing
society,
let
us
take
for
instance
capital
punishment,
i
have
every
confidence
that
someday
in
the
future,
if
the
world
survived
that
this
body
is
going
to
say
that
capital
punishment
violates
due
process.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
my
concept
of
due
process
mr.
justice
black,
which
i
think
goes
back
to
the
law
of
the
land
at
magna
carta
and
to
bracton
who
said
that
the
king
was
under
god
and
the
law,
this
concept
which
is
an
evolving
concept,
i
think
the
majority
of
this
court
can
determine
at
any
time
and
place
what
that
due
process
cause
means.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
this
court
has
done
very
well,
under
this
constitution
and
for
my
part,
my
admiration
goes
with
it.
i
am
prepared
to
abide
with
what
the
majority
of
this
court
says.
comports
with
fundamental
fairness,
which
in
our
constitution
in
two
clauses
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
the
fourteenth
is
called
due
process.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i'll
still
abide
by
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no.
i'd
have
to
say
no.
i
pitch
mine
on
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
say
this.
i
think
that
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
it's
either
that
or
you
have
one
there
on
foreign
relations.
i
haven't
gone
into
this
because
no
body
has
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
giving
american
citizens
at
birth
to
the
child
born
abroad
with
an
american
parent.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes.
congress
cannot
expect--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
and
i
would
add
this.
i
think
that
angelika
schneider
was
just
as
much
as
statutory
citizen
as
aldo
mario
bellei,
because
she
didn't
go
through
any
naturalization
proceeding.
there
was
a
statute
which
said,
because
her
parents
were
naturalized,
she
was
a
citizen
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
statute
and
the
one
which
declared
aldo
mario
bellei
a
citizen
at
birth.
i
think
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
schneider's
parents
were
here,
yes,
but
there
is
also
a
provision
with
referenced
to
aldo
mario
bellei's
mother
that
she
had
to
be
here
for
ten
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
the
age
of
14.
there
is
also
a
residence
requirement
in
1993
as
amended
and
it's
10
years.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
divide
the
time
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
with
professor
gardner
of
the
columbia
law
school
who
did
the
april
brief
on
behalf
of
the
amici
curiae
association
of
american
wives
married
to
europeans
and
the
american
bar
association.
counsel,
i
suppose
in
their
role
as
advocates,
no
matter
how
objective
they
try
to
be
are
going
to
state
facts
a
little
bit
differently.
now,
the
solicitor
general
stated
that
rev.
stat.
1993
as
amended
by
the
nationality
act
of
1944
was
amended.
1934
was
amended
in
1940,
i
think
a
more
correct
statement
would
be
that
section
1993
as
amended
was
repealed
by
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
but
there
was
a
saving
clause
which
provided
that
this
repeal
shall
not
terminate
nationality
here
to
for
lawfully
acquired.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
five
brief
visits.
if
i
were
stating
that
on
behalf
of
appellee,
i
would
say
that
he
made
visits
here
which
were
substantially,
were
all
about
three
months
or
more.
he
came
here
from
april
27
of
48
to
july
31,
1948;
this
was
to
visit
his
grandparents.
his
mother
was
born
and
raised
in
philadelphia.
she
lived
there
until
after
her
24th
birthday,
she
married
the
appellee
and
a
few
days
later
went
to
italy.
she
has
always
been
an
american
citizen.
she’s
prized
that
as
has
the
appellee.
he
registered
for
selective
service
in
italy.
he
passed
his
test.
he
was
due
to
be
inducted
but
he
was
working
on
a
nato
defense
program
as
a
result
of
which
he
was
deferred
and
then
he
was
later
on
told
“well,
we’ve
taken
your
citizenship
away”.
now
mr.
justice
harlan
in
answer
to
your
question,
at
the
time
of
drafting
the
stipulation,
he
was
in
england
working
on
a
nato
defense
project
for
a
company
called
magical
limited,
he
is
at
present
back
in
italy.
but
further
on
his
visit,
there
was
another
visit
from
july
10,
of
'51
to
october
5,
of
'51.
there
was
another
visit
from
june
of
'55
until
october
of
'55.
these
aren’t
brief
visits.
these
are
visits
for
substantial
periods
of
time
and
they
were
to
visit
his
maternal
grandparents.
when
he
married
in
italy,
he
wanted
to
come
over
here
a
fifth
time
and
this
time
they
told
him
“well,
your
american
citizenship
has
expired.”
he
again
wanted
to
come
here
to
visit
his
maternal
grandparents.
for
12
years,
aldo
mario
bellei
had
his
own
united
states
passport
as
an
american
citizen
from
1952
until
1964,
and
this
is
what
the
government
now
says
that
without
his
consent,
they
can't
take
away
from
him.
i
do
read
these
statutes
but
with
a
slightly
different
emphasis.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
there
in
the
government’s
brief
at
45
and
46
and
the
way
that
now
reads,
it
says
“the
following
shall
be
nationals
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
at
birth.
and
when
it
comes
to
taking
the
nationality
away,
it’s
an
expatriation
statute.”
it
says
any
person
who
is
a
national
and
citizen
of
the
united
states
at
birth
under
the
section
i’ve
just
read
shall
lose
his
nationality
and
citizenship.
that
is
an
expatriation
statute.
now,
the
solicitor
general
asked
what
provison
was
violated.
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
am
not
asking
for
any
absolute
here.
i
am
relying
on
schneider
against
rusk
which
i
say
is
precisely
in
point.
now,
angelica
schneider
was
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen.
angelica
schneider
never
stood
up
in
any
united
states
court,
raised
her
hand
and
swore
an
oath
of
allegiance.
no.
her
mother
did
that
and
then
the
statute
said
and
that
statute
to
be
found
in
8
usc
section
1432
or
immigration
and
nationality
lawyers
would
refer
to
that
as
section
321
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and
that
says
in
its
very
caption,
“automatic
citizenship”.
so
what
i
am
relying
on
as
a
case
being
precisely
in
point
is
schneider
against
rusk
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
angelica
schneider
was
just
as
much
a
statutory
citizen
if
that's
what
the
government
wanted
to
draw
the
distinction
between
statutory
and
fourth
amendment.
angelica
schneider
was
just
as
much
as
statutory
citizen
as
aldo
mario
bellei.
and
if
schneider
against
rusk
is
to
be
followed
where
the
court
held
that
the
section
which
required
angelica
schneider
to
have
her
citizenship
taken
away
because
she
returned
to
the
country
of
her
origin
for
three
years,
i
say
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
if
that
provision
as
held
on
constitution
as
it
was
on
the
ground
that
more
over
while
the
fifth
amendment
contains
no
equal
protection
clause,
it
does
forbid
discrimination
that
it
is
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violating
of
due
process.
if
that
decision
is
correct,
then
the
provision
requiring
aldo
mario
bellei
to
come
here
and
be
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28,
likewise,
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
am
asking
for
no
absolute
but
i
am
asking
on
the
basis
of
schneider
against
rusk
that
where
this
government
has
given
citizenship
at
birth,
it
cannot
come
along.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
take
it
away
without
the
voluntary
act
of
the
one
who
got
citizenship.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
look
at
the
due
process
clause
and
i
would
apply
that
in
the
same
manner
in
which
your
honor
thinks
it
should
be
applied,
namely
what
constitutes
fundamental
fairness
at
the
time
of
the
decision
and
i
would
probably
as
a
lawyer,
and
lawyers
are
careful
in
their
phrasing.
i
would
probably
say
it
would
make
a
difference.
we
lawyers
are
supposed
to
be
careful
at
draftsmanship
and
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
it
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
condition
subsequent
or
a
condition
preceding.
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
a
case
where
congress
had
said
“you
are
not
a
citizen.
you
are
going
to
be
a
citizen
under
the
performance
of
certain
conditions.”
that
would
be
one
thing.
i
think
i
would
draw
the
difference
and
would
say
that
where
is
condition
preceding,
that’s
one
thing.
but
where
it’s
a
condition
subsequent
where
congress
says
as
it
did
in
this
case,
“you
are
a
citizen
at
birth”
i
would
then
say
you
can’t
come
along
later
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
say
oh
by
the
way,
because
you
did
not
come
here
for
five
years,
we
are
now
going
to
take
it
away.
i
would
say
it
makes
a
difference,
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
precisely
in
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
that
connection
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
had
a
question
in
the
same
area.
i
can
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
december
4,
1969.
senator
kennedy
on
behalf
of
himself
and
23
other
senators
introduced
s3202
in
the
91st
congress
first
session.
it
is
in
its
second
session
now.
a
bill
to
revise
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
that
bill
was
referred
to
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary.
now
respecting
section
21
of
this
bill,
senator
kennedy
stated
this
as
found
in
the
115
congressional
record;
page
15612
of
the
daily
edition.
this
important
segment
of
public
policy
has
been
ignored
and
overlooked
by
the
congress
since
the
codification
and
amendment
of
nationality
and
naturalization
laws
in
1952.
there
is
little
doubt
that
many
provisions
in
the
basic
statute
are
product
of
a
harsher
period
in
our
nation’s
history
and
should
have
no
place
in
the
public
policy
of
a
free
society.
but
aside
from
this
court’s
decisions
in
recent
years
have
altered
the
statute
considerably.
the
situation
clearly
demands
a
comprehensive
review
and
evaluation
of
our
nationality
and
naturalization
policy.
so
that
entering
that
question
of
course,
one
cannot
say
what
congress
is
going
to
do.
but
my
feeling
would
be
that
if
that
congress
did
act,
it
would
as
it
has
done
a
number
of
times
in
the
past.
ameliorate
the
situation
and
bring
about
the
result
that
i
am
asking
this
court
for
right
now
in
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
on
the
basis
of
schneider
against
rusk.
so
that
i
say
that
citizenship
as
an
absolute
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
precise
question
here
as
sharpened
by
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question
is
whether
having
given
american
citizenship
at
birth
and
there
is
no
doubt,
but
that’s
what
the
statute
did,
whether
congress
can
then
come
along
with
a
condition
subsequent
and
make
what
the
court
called
in
schneider
against
rusk,
second
class
citizens
out
of
such
persons.
and
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
done
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
do
not
read
that
case
that
way
mr.
justice.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
her
mother
took
the
naturalization
oath;
angelica
never
did.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
by
virtue
of
a
statute.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
depends
now
on
what
the
language
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means
that
a
person
has
to
stand
up
in
a
district
court
as
they
do,
raise
their
right
hand
and
take
the
oath
of
allegiance.
if
that’s
what
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then,
as
i
read
schneider
against
rusk,
angelica
schneider
never
did
that,
her
mother
did.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
am
not
claiming.
i
am
not
claiming
either
naturalization
under
the
fourteenth
--
i
am
not
claiming
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
am
placing
mine
plainly
and
simply
on
the
fifth
--
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
do
say
that
if
my
understanding
of
schneider
against
rusk
is
correct,
namely
that
angelica
schneider
never
stood
up
and
took
the
oath
of
naturalization
and
this
is
what
i
think
naturalization
in
the
united
states
means.
angelica
schneider
never
did
that,
her
mother
did.
and
as
far
as
protecting
the
interests
of
this
country
in
the
dissenting
opinion
there
in
schneider
against
rusk
by
mr.
justice
clark,
this
is
the
way
he
describes
the
appellant
there.
he
says
and
here
appellant
has
been
away
from
the
country
for
10
years,
has
married
a
foreign
citizen,
has
continuously
lived
with
him
in
her
native
land
for
eight
years,
has
born
four
sons
who
are
german
nationals
and
admits
that
she
has
no
intention
to
return
to
this
country.
we
have
quite
a
different
situation
with
dual
nationals
such
as
are
involved
in
the
present
case,
and
i
cannot
see
why
schneider
against
rusk
isn’t
directly
in
point
because
i
don’t
think
angelica
schneider
was
naturalized
in
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
her
mother
was.
and
then
a
statute
and
i’ve
called
attention
to
it
has
the
caption
under
which
she
gets
citizenship.
this
is
8
usc
section
1432
says
“conditions
for
automatic
citizenship”
but
that
is
a
statutory
provision.
just
as
much
statutory
as
the
one
that
said
aldo
mario
bellei
is
a
citizen
at
birth.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well
as
i
read
this
section
under
which
i
think
angelica
schneider
was
a
citizen,
it's
8
usc
section
1432
and
it
says
conditions
for
automatic
citizenship.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
my
difference
with
your
honor
is
this,
i
cannot
see
my
way
clear
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
i
mean
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
angelica
schneider
was
any
more
a
statutory
--
was
a
statutory
citizen
just
as
aldo
mario
bellei
was.
i
can’t
feel
that
she
comes
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
statute
says
because
your
mother
was
naturalized,
we’re
going
to
call
you
a
naturalized
citizen.
that’s
a
statute
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
--
well,
the
government
draws
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
the
government
draws
a
distinction
mr.
justice
white
between
one
who
is
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
you
might
say
that
where
you’re
a
citizen
by
the
constitution,
that
is
something
which
cannot
be
taken
away
at
all
and
you
don’t
get
to
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
a
great
feeling
for
the
due
process
clause
either
of
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
would
find
myself
very
ready
in
almost
any
situation
where
a
client
of
mine
had
a
grievance
to
make
an
argument
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
o.
john
rogge
oh
yes,
yes.
i
could
then
make
it
a
fortiori
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
want
to
follow
this
through.
i
might
say
--
if
it
were
under
–
if
i
felt
it
was
truly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
is
a
situation
where
i
would
say
it
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
did
not
have
to
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
you’re
right.
i
would
say
it
was
a
fortiori
but
i
think
as
i
reflect
on
it
more,
i
would
not
rely
on
it
because
if
i
had
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen
whether
by
birth
or
naturalization,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
say
i
don’t
have
to
rely
on
the
due
process
clause.
but
in
this
situation
where
i
think
it
is
precisely
controlling,
i
do
rely
on.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well
if
i
have
to
rely
on
it,
i
would
and
i
do
rely
on
it
in
this
case
and
i
do
say
that
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point.
now,
i
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
never
placed
this
on
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship,
if
your
honor
please,
that’s
one
reason
why
i
could
see
we
have
tussle
with
the
government
here,
but
i
--
even
though
my
client
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen,
he
is
a
citizen
at
birth
by
statute
and
i
think
under
schneider
against
rusk
and
even
if
schneider
against
rusk
were
not
there,
i
would
say
on
the
basis
of
fundamental
fairness,
this
government
can’t
come
along
to
someone
who
wants
his
citizenship,
who
had
his
passport
for
12
years
as
an
american
citizen
and
say
“oh
by
the
way,
we’re
now
taking
that
away
from
you
and
seek
to
that
without
his
consent.”
mr.
o.
john
rogge
absolutely.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
the
balance
of
the
time
over
to
professor
gardner.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
addition
to
the
usual
documents
of
this
case,
the
court
should
also
have
before
it
the
briefs,
amici
curiae
in
one
of
which
the
american
bar
association
has
joined.
may
i
spend
just
a
brief
a
moment
on
the
facts?
aldo
mario
bellei's
mother
was
born
and
raised
in
philadelphia
where
she
stayed
until
she
was
24
when
she
married
aldo
mario
bellei's
father
and
moved
within
the
italy.
her
parents
have
remained
in
philadelphia.
on
five
different
occasions,
aldo
mario
bellei
came
to
this
country
to
visit
his
grandparents.
on
the
first
two
such
occasions,
he
came
on
his
mother's
passport.
and
on
the
second
two
such
occasions,
he
came
on
his
own
passport.
the
fifth
occasion,
our
state
department
denied
him
a
passport,
this
is
when
he
wanted
to
come
here
with
his
bride
to
visit
his
grandparents
and
he
did,
but
he
did
that
on
an
italian
passport.
aldo
mario
bellei
has
had
his
own
united
states
passport
as
an
american
citizen
for
a
period
of
12
years.
he
first
got
it
as
you
will
see
from
page
6
of
the
appendix
on
june
27,
1952,
if
you'll
turn
to
page
11,
you
will
find
that
it
was
renewed
from
time
to
time
until
february
11,
1964.
now,
the
government
comes
along
with
the
conditions
subsequently
imposed
and
seeks
to
take
this
way
and
i
think
this
case
presents
the
simple
question,
whether
the
congress
has
the
power
with
reference
to
an
american
citizen
at
birth
to
take
away
that
citizenship
without
his
voluntary
renunciation
and
can
do
that
consistent
with
the
due
process
cause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that's
what
i
think
the
issue
is
on
this
case.
and
in
answer
to
the
question
that
you
put,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
it
is
the
government's
position
that
two
aliens
coming
over
here,
having
a
child
born
here
and
returning
to
their
own
country
or
the
case
of
a
person's
naturalized
over
here
with
a
minor
child,
that
those
children
have
greater
rights
than
a
person
like
aldo
mario
bellei,
who
by
section
1993
of
revised
statutes
and
as
amended
by
the
nationality
act
of
1934
was
given
american
citizenship
at
birth.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
act
that
schneider
against
ruck
is
precisely
in
point
because
angelika
schneider
never
went
through
naturalization
proceedings.
her
parents
came
over
and
were
naturalized
at
an
act
of
congress
then
said
that
she
was
an
american
citizen.
i
cannot
see
what
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point.
and
then
in
that
case,
it
was
held
at
the
fact
that
angelika
schneider
who
had
citizenship
by
statute,
she
could
go
abroad
to
germany
and
stay
there
and
the
three-year
residence
requirement
was
declared
unconstitutional.
i
submit
the
same
reasoning
that
in
schneider
against
rusk
compelled
that
provision
to
be
held
unconstitutional
compels
the
section
that
was
attacked
and
held
unconstitutional
below
which
is
the
provision
of
the
immigration
of
nationality
act
of
1952,
is
likewise
unconstitutional.
the
provision
at
the
time
that
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born,
required
that
he
come
here
for
five
years,
immediately
previous
to
his
18th
birthday
and
unless
within
six
months
after
the
child's
21st
birthday,
he
or
she
shall
take
both
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
of
america.
now,
that
section
was
repealed
by
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
but
that
repeal
had
in
it
this
proviso
that
the
repeal
shall
not
terminate
nationality
heretofore
lawfully
acquired.
so
you
have
someone
who
has
american
citizenship
at
birth
and
congress
comes
along
in
a
condition
subsequently
enacted
and
says,
he
doesn't
have
it
anymore.
now,
the
government
says,
well,
this
thing
about
coming
here
for
five
years
is
really
a
small
thing,
it
doesn't
mean
anything,
it's
a
great
hardship.
a
child
living
with
his
parents,
it
would
mean,
if
they
wanted
to
give
him
an
education,
they
would
have
to
have
quite
a
few
thousand
dollars
to
send
him
over
here
at
that
period
of
his
life
in
order
to
acquire
it.
it
would
draw
a
distinction
between
those
who
can
afford
to
do
this
and
those
who
can't.
now,
the
government
also
takes
the
position
that
such
a
person
has
no
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states.
well,
i
submit
that
this
country
has
changed
in
the
past
40
years,
where
americans
living
abroad
have
increased
20-fold
from
some
hundred
thousand
a
year
to
two
million
a
year.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they're
residing
abroad,
i
mean
they're
not
just
travelers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
dallas
wrote
a
piece
in
which
he
was
taking
about
the
million
in
europe
to
which
they're
added
a
million
tourists,
i'm
not
talking
about
tourists.
i'm
not
saying
when
you
say
permanently,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
they're
residing
there.
this
is--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they're
non-tourists,
yes.
in
most
of
the
big
cities
of
the
world,
you
have
large
chunks
of
america
today.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
think
about
half
are
military,
yes,
half
of
the
two
million.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
rather
than
worrying
about
having
a
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states,
europeans
are
worrying
that
we're
americanizing
europe.
a
study
was
done,
25
families
with
american
wives,
all
but
two
fathers
spoke
english.
there
were
47
children
there.
26
spoke
english
as
the
primary
language
or
english
and
french
with
equal
of
fluency,
only
five
spoke
french.
i
submit
that
we
should
regard
these
international
children
as
a
valuable
asset
of
this
country.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
this
is
another
thing.
if
a
child
is
born
of
two
american
parents,
then
there
is
no
problem,
but
if
this
court
should
hold
that
this
statute
is
constitutional,
then
another
congress
can
come
along
and
say,
“children
born
of
two
american
parents,
we're
going
to
take
that
citizenship
away
too”
and
i
submit
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
there
were
two
american
parents,
i
mean
if
the
military
abroad
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
this
situation
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
would
have
to
be
ultimately,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
as
almost
as
complicated
as
income
tax
laws.
i
know
this
specific
section
with
which
i'm
dealing
and
i
do
know
that
the
child
born
of
two
american
parents,
there
is
no
problem.
it's
the
child
born
of
one
american
parent
of
which
there's
a
problem
and
in
the
provisions
with
which
i'm
familiar.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
almost
feel
like
consulting
the
opposition.
i
don't
know
[laughter]
well,
let
me
take
mr.
charles
gordon
over
here
who
does
this
all
the
time.
i
almost
say
to
mr.
charles
gordon,
does
he
know
of
an
exception
for
that
situation.
i
don't.
but
in
connection
with
your
honor's
question,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
if
this
statute
is
held
constitutional
then
congress
has
the
follow
some
future
session
that
come
along
and
take
away
the
american
citizenship
of
a
child
born
abroad
of
two
american
parents,
on
the
government's
interpretation
here.
that's
my
point,
that
in
today's
world
of
united
nations
and
i
haven't
emphasized
this
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
should
regard
these
children
as
an
asset.
i
mean,
we
now
have
diplomatic
relations
with
over
100
foreign
countries
where
members
of
more
than
70
international
organizations,
we
give
military
and
economic
assistance
to
over
50
foreign
countries.
our
business
enterprises
have
more
than
a
hundred
billion
dollars
invested
abroad.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
on
a
due
process
question,
i'd
say
yes
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
also
say
this,
i'm
trying
to
meet
the
argument
of
the
government
where
they
think
that
these
children
are
not
an
asset,
that
they're
burden
we
should
get
rid
off
and
they
talk
about
no
meaningful
connection
to
the
united
states.
and
i
would
like
to
counter
that
by
saying
that
this
is
an
asset
that
this
country
should
welcome
rather
than
say
that
they
are
burden.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i'd
say
on
that
i
don't
think
it's
a
rational
thing
for
congress
to
do,
with
reference
to
someone
who
has
american
citizenship
at
birth
to
come
along
with
condition
subsequently
imposed.
in
other
words,
the
aldo
mario
bellei
got
american
citizenship
in
1939
and
he
had
it,
at
l
east
he
had
it
until
1952
when
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
came
along
and
said
that
“well,
now
you
have
got
to
come
here
and
be
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28.”
and
those
early
years
are
the
years
if
he's
in
his
own
family
context
unless
you're
a
child
of
wealthy
parents,
they
can't
afford
to
send
him
over
here
for
education
during
that
period.
this
is
a
year
when
he
goes
to
college.
the
year
when
goes
to
college.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
i'd
say
that
if
that's
what
they
have
in
mind,
congress
has
mistaken
in
today's
world
because
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
because
this
is
an
unreasonable
requirement,
it's
an
unreasonable
classification.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
and
my
position
is
that
this
does
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
angelika
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point
and
i
think
the
courts
approach
in
afroyim
against
rusk
is
also
important.
but
as
to
the
arguments
that
are
made
in
the
government
brief
that
these
children
are
a
liability.
i
think
on
the
contrary,
on
the
context
of
today's
world
where
we
make
supersonic
flights
to
europe
now
for
about
six
hours,
and
you
may
have
colonies
on
mars
in
the
future
century
where
you
are
--
where
we
are
interdependent
nations,
i
think
we
should
regard
these
children
as
an
asset.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
you
put
me
a
different
case
when
you
put
it
as
a
condition
preceding,
that's
not
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
the
congress
had
said,
congress
didn't
say
that,
but
if
the
congress
had
said
“these
steps
must
be
taken
before
you
can
become
a
citizen”,
that's
one
thing.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i'd
have
more
trouble
with
that
case.
that
would
be
a
--
if
were
put
as
a
condition
preceding,
i
could
concede
it
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
it
wouldn't
be
irrational
maybe,
but
that's
not
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
right.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
think
it's
whether
as
condition
to
preceding
or
a
condition
subsequent.
the
congress
had
said
that
these
children,
and
i
may
say
congress
has
long
said
that
a
child
born
of
an
american
father
is
a
citizen
at
birth.
there
hadn't
been
any
problem
about
that
or
was
ever
questioned
one
way
of
the
other
and
then
when
the
statute
was
broadened
to
include
american
mothers,
it
was
then
that
you
got
these
conditions
in
here.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i've
said,
i
distinguished
the
two
cases
and
mr.
justice
white
was
saying
that
--
by
answer
--
i
thought
i
understood
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
white,
but
there
was
no
distinction
between
the
condition
preceding
on
the
condition
subsequent,
i
think
there
is.
and
i
think,
the
congress
could
very
well,
i
mean
i
could
go
along
with
part
of
the
premise,
the
congress
might
have
the
power
to
say
that
a
child
born
abroad
of
an
american
parent
will
not
get
citizenship
unless
they
come
here
for
five
years
as
a
condition
precedent,
but
that
is
what
congress
did
here.
the
congress
gave
the
citizenship,
they
were
some
conditions
subsequent
but
even
those
were
repealed.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes.
that's
a
simple
question
in
this
case
and
congress
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
expatriate
without
consent.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
fifth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
it
has
to
be
the
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
a
great
feeling
for
the
concept
of
due
process
as
fundamental
fairness.
i
know
that
mr.
justice
black
has
had
a
problem
with
that,
but
the
due
process
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
expounded
it,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
would
now
expound
it
that
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness
or
the
conscience
of
the
time
and
to
my
mind
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes
[laughter]
if
your
honor
please.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
am
prepared
to
take
the
judgment
of
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
great
institutions
of
the
world
to
take
the
minds,
the
trained
minds
of
the
members
of
this
body,
sitting
down
at
any
particular
time
at
a
problem
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
i'll
be
glad
to
abide,
but
i'll
go
one
step
further.
with
that
same
concept,
and
the
concept
of
this
country
as
a
maturing
society,
let
us
take
for
instance
capital
punishment,
i
have
every
confidence
that
someday
in
the
future,
if
the
world
survived
that
this
body
is
going
to
say
that
capital
punishment
violates
due
process.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
my
concept
of
due
process
mr.
justice
black,
which
i
think
goes
back
to
the
law
of
the
land
at
magna
carta
and
to
bracton
who
said
that
the
king
was
under
god
and
the
law,
this
concept
which
is
an
evolving
concept,
i
think
the
majority
of
this
court
can
determine
at
any
time
and
place
what
that
due
process
cause
means.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
this
court
has
done
very
well,
under
this
constitution
and
for
my
part,
my
admiration
goes
with
it.
i
am
prepared
to
abide
with
what
the
majority
of
this
court
says.
comports
with
fundamental
fairness,
which
in
our
constitution
in
two
clauses
in
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
the
fourteenth
is
called
due
process.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i'll
still
abide
by
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no.
i'd
have
to
say
no.
i
pitch
mine
on
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
say
this.
i
think
that
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
it's
either
that
or
you
have
one
there
on
foreign
relations.
i
haven't
gone
into
this
because
no
body
has
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
giving
american
citizens
at
birth
to
the
child
born
abroad
with
an
american
parent.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
yes.
congress
cannot
expect--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
and
i
would
add
this.
i
think
that
angelika
schneider
was
just
as
much
as
statutory
citizen
as
aldo
mario
bellei,
because
she
didn't
go
through
any
naturalization
proceeding.
there
was
a
statute
which
said,
because
her
parents
were
naturalized,
she
was
a
citizen
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
statute
and
the
one
which
declared
aldo
mario
bellei
a
citizen
at
birth.
i
think
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
schneider's
parents
were
here,
yes,
but
there
is
also
a
provision
with
referenced
to
aldo
mario
bellei's
mother
that
she
had
to
be
here
for
ten
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
the
age
of
14.
there
is
also
a
residence
requirement
in
1993
as
amended
and
it's
10
years.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
divide
the
time
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
with
professor
gardner
of
the
columbia
law
school
who
did
the
april
brief
on
behalf
of
the
amici
curiae
association
of
american
wives
married
to
europeans
and
the
american
bar
association.
counsel,
i
suppose
in
their
role
as
advocates,
no
matter
how
objective
they
try
to
be
are
going
to
state
facts
a
little
bit
differently.
now,
the
solicitor
general
stated
that
rev.
stat.
1993
as
amended
by
the
nationality
act
of
1944
was
amended.
1934
was
amended
in
1940,
i
think
a
more
correct
statement
would
be
that
section
1993
as
amended
was
repealed
by
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
but
there
was
a
saving
clause
which
provided
that
this
repeal
shall
not
terminate
nationality
here
to
for
lawfully
acquired.
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
five
brief
visits.
if
i
were
stating
that
on
behalf
of
appellee,
i
would
say
that
he
made
visits
here
which
were
substantially,
were
all
about
three
months
or
more.
he
came
here
from
april
27
of
48
to
july
31,
1948;
this
was
to
visit
his
grandparents.
his
mother
was
born
and
raised
in
philadelphia.
she
lived
there
until
after
her
24th
birthday,
she
married
the
appellee
and
a
few
days
later
went
to
italy.
she
has
always
been
an
american
citizen.
she’s
prized
that
as
has
the
appellee.
he
registered
for
selective
service
in
italy.
he
passed
his
test.
he
was
due
to
be
inducted
but
he
was
working
on
a
nato
defense
program
as
a
result
of
which
he
was
deferred
and
then
he
was
later
on
told
“well,
we’ve
taken
your
citizenship
away”.
now
mr.
justice
harlan
in
answer
to
your
question,
at
the
time
of
drafting
the
stipulation,
he
was
in
england
working
on
a
nato
defense
project
for
a
company
called
magical
limited,
he
is
at
present
back
in
italy.
but
further
on
his
visit,
there
was
another
visit
from
july
10,
of
'51
to
october
5,
of
'51.
there
was
another
visit
from
june
of
'55
until
october
of
'55.
these
aren’t
brief
visits.
these
are
visits
for
substantial
periods
of
time
and
they
were
to
visit
his
maternal
grandparents.
when
he
married
in
italy,
he
wanted
to
come
over
here
a
fifth
time
and
this
time
they
told
him
“well,
your
american
citizenship
has
expired.”
he
again
wanted
to
come
here
to
visit
his
maternal
grandparents.
for
12
years,
aldo
mario
bellei
had
his
own
united
states
passport
as
an
american
citizen
from
1952
until
1964,
and
this
is
what
the
government
now
says
that
without
his
consent,
they
can't
take
away
from
him.
i
do
read
these
statutes
but
with
a
slightly
different
emphasis.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
there
in
the
government’s
brief
at
45
and
46
and
the
way
that
now
reads,
it
says
“the
following
shall
be
nationals
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
at
birth.
and
when
it
comes
to
taking
the
nationality
away,
it’s
an
expatriation
statute.”
it
says
any
person
who
is
a
national
and
citizen
of
the
united
states
at
birth
under
the
section
i’ve
just
read
shall
lose
his
nationality
and
citizenship.
that
is
an
expatriation
statute.
now,
the
solicitor
general
asked
what
provison
was
violated.
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
am
not
asking
for
any
absolute
here.
i
am
relying
on
schneider
against
rusk
which
i
say
is
precisely
in
point.
now,
angelica
schneider
was
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen.
angelica
schneider
never
stood
up
in
any
united
states
court,
raised
her
hand
and
swore
an
oath
of
allegiance.
no.
her
mother
did
that
and
then
the
statute
said
and
that
statute
to
be
found
in
8
usc
section
1432
or
immigration
and
nationality
lawyers
would
refer
to
that
as
section
321
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and
that
says
in
its
very
caption,
“automatic
citizenship”.
so
what
i
am
relying
on
as
a
case
being
precisely
in
point
is
schneider
against
rusk
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
angelica
schneider
was
just
as
much
a
statutory
citizen
if
that's
what
the
government
wanted
to
draw
the
distinction
between
statutory
and
fourth
amendment.
angelica
schneider
was
just
as
much
as
statutory
citizen
as
aldo
mario
bellei.
and
if
schneider
against
rusk
is
to
be
followed
where
the
court
held
that
the
section
which
required
angelica
schneider
to
have
her
citizenship
taken
away
because
she
returned
to
the
country
of
her
origin
for
three
years,
i
say
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
if
that
provision
as
held
on
constitution
as
it
was
on
the
ground
that
more
over
while
the
fifth
amendment
contains
no
equal
protection
clause,
it
does
forbid
discrimination
that
it
is
so
unjustifiable
as
to
be
violating
of
due
process.
if
that
decision
is
correct,
then
the
provision
requiring
aldo
mario
bellei
to
come
here
and
be
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28,
likewise,
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
am
asking
for
no
absolute
but
i
am
asking
on
the
basis
of
schneider
against
rusk
that
where
this
government
has
given
citizenship
at
birth,
it
cannot
come
along.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
take
it
away
without
the
voluntary
act
of
the
one
who
got
citizenship.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
look
at
the
due
process
clause
and
i
would
apply
that
in
the
same
manner
in
which
your
honor
thinks
it
should
be
applied,
namely
what
constitutes
fundamental
fairness
at
the
time
of
the
decision
and
i
would
probably
as
a
lawyer,
and
lawyers
are
careful
in
their
phrasing.
i
would
probably
say
it
would
make
a
difference.
we
lawyers
are
supposed
to
be
careful
at
draftsmanship
and
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
it
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
condition
subsequent
or
a
condition
preceding.
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
a
case
where
congress
had
said
“you
are
not
a
citizen.
you
are
going
to
be
a
citizen
under
the
performance
of
certain
conditions.”
that
would
be
one
thing.
i
think
i
would
draw
the
difference
and
would
say
that
where
is
condition
preceding,
that’s
one
thing.
but
where
it’s
a
condition
subsequent
where
congress
says
as
it
did
in
this
case,
“you
are
a
citizen
at
birth”
i
would
then
say
you
can’t
come
along
later
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
say
oh
by
the
way,
because
you
did
not
come
here
for
five
years,
we
are
now
going
to
take
it
away.
i
would
say
it
makes
a
difference,
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
precisely
in
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
that
connection
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
had
a
question
in
the
same
area.
i
can
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
december
4,
1969.
senator
kennedy
on
behalf
of
himself
and
23
other
senators
introduced
s3202
in
the
91st
congress
first
session.
it
is
in
its
second
session
now.
a
bill
to
revise
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
that
bill
was
referred
to
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary.
now
respecting
section
21
of
this
bill,
senator
kennedy
stated
this
as
found
in
the
115
congressional
record;
page
15612
of
the
daily
edition.
this
important
segment
of
public
policy
has
been
ignored
and
overlooked
by
the
congress
since
the
codification
and
amendment
of
nationality
and
naturalization
laws
in
1952.
there
is
little
doubt
that
many
provisions
in
the
basic
statute
are
product
of
a
harsher
period
in
our
nation’s
history
and
should
have
no
place
in
the
public
policy
of
a
free
society.
but
aside
from
this
court’s
decisions
in
recent
years
have
altered
the
statute
considerably.
the
situation
clearly
demands
a
comprehensive
review
and
evaluation
of
our
nationality
and
naturalization
policy.
so
that
entering
that
question
of
course,
one
cannot
say
what
congress
is
going
to
do.
but
my
feeling
would
be
that
if
that
congress
did
act,
it
would
as
it
has
done
a
number
of
times
in
the
past.
ameliorate
the
situation
and
bring
about
the
result
that
i
am
asking
this
court
for
right
now
in
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
on
the
basis
of
schneider
against
rusk.
so
that
i
say
that
citizenship
as
an
absolute
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
precise
question
here
as
sharpened
by
mr.
justice
harlan’s
question
is
whether
having
given
american
citizenship
at
birth
and
there
is
no
doubt,
but
that’s
what
the
statute
did,
whether
congress
can
then
come
along
with
a
condition
subsequent
and
make
what
the
court
called
in
schneider
against
rusk,
second
class
citizens
out
of
such
persons.
and
i
submit
that
that
cannot
be
done
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
do
not
read
that
case
that
way
mr.
justice.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
her
mother
took
the
naturalization
oath;
angelica
never
did.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
by
virtue
of
a
statute.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that
depends
now
on
what
the
language
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
if
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means
that
a
person
has
to
stand
up
in
a
district
court
as
they
do,
raise
their
right
hand
and
take
the
oath
of
allegiance.
if
that’s
what
naturalized
in
the
united
states
means
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then,
as
i
read
schneider
against
rusk,
angelica
schneider
never
did
that,
her
mother
did.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
am
not
claiming.
i
am
not
claiming
either
naturalization
under
the
fourteenth
--
i
am
not
claiming
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
am
placing
mine
plainly
and
simply
on
the
fifth
--
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
do
say
that
if
my
understanding
of
schneider
against
rusk
is
correct,
namely
that
angelica
schneider
never
stood
up
and
took
the
oath
of
naturalization
and
this
is
what
i
think
naturalization
in
the
united
states
means.
angelica
schneider
never
did
that,
her
mother
did.
and
as
far
as
protecting
the
interests
of
this
country
in
the
dissenting
opinion
there
in
schneider
against
rusk
by
mr.
justice
clark,
this
is
the
way
he
describes
the
appellant
there.
he
says
and
here
appellant
has
been
away
from
the
country
for
10
years,
has
married
a
foreign
citizen,
has
continuously
lived
with
him
in
her
native
land
for
eight
years,
has
born
four
sons
who
are
german
nationals
and
admits
that
she
has
no
intention
to
return
to
this
country.
we
have
quite
a
different
situation
with
dual
nationals
such
as
are
involved
in
the
present
case,
and
i
cannot
see
why
schneider
against
rusk
isn’t
directly
in
point
because
i
don’t
think
angelica
schneider
was
naturalized
in
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
her
mother
was.
and
then
a
statute
and
i’ve
called
attention
to
it
has
the
caption
under
which
she
gets
citizenship.
this
is
8
usc
section
1432
says
“conditions
for
automatic
citizenship”
but
that
is
a
statutory
provision.
just
as
much
statutory
as
the
one
that
said
aldo
mario
bellei
is
a
citizen
at
birth.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well
as
i
read
this
section
under
which
i
think
angelica
schneider
was
a
citizen,
it's
8
usc
section
1432
and
it
says
conditions
for
automatic
citizenship.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
my
difference
with
your
honor
is
this,
i
cannot
see
my
way
clear
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
i
mean
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
angelica
schneider
was
any
more
a
statutory
--
was
a
statutory
citizen
just
as
aldo
mario
bellei
was.
i
can’t
feel
that
she
comes
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
statute
says
because
your
mother
was
naturalized,
we’re
going
to
call
you
a
naturalized
citizen.
that’s
a
statute
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
--
well,
the
government
draws
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
the
government
draws
a
distinction
mr.
justice
white
between
one
who
is
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well,
you
might
say
that
where
you’re
a
citizen
by
the
constitution,
that
is
something
which
cannot
be
taken
away
at
all
and
you
don’t
get
to
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
justice
white,
i
have
a
great
feeling
for
the
due
process
clause
either
of
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
would
find
myself
very
ready
in
almost
any
situation
where
a
client
of
mine
had
a
grievance
to
make
an
argument
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
o.
john
rogge
oh
yes,
yes.
i
could
then
make
it
a
fortiori
case.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
no,
i
want
to
follow
this
through.
i
might
say
--
if
it
were
under
–
if
i
felt
it
was
truly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
is
a
situation
where
i
would
say
it
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
did
not
have
to
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
you’re
right.
i
would
say
it
was
a
fortiori
but
i
think
as
i
reflect
on
it
more,
i
would
not
rely
on
it
because
if
i
had
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen
whether
by
birth
or
naturalization,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
say
i
don’t
have
to
rely
on
the
due
process
clause.
but
in
this
situation
where
i
think
it
is
precisely
controlling,
i
do
rely
on.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
well
if
i
have
to
rely
on
it,
i
would
and
i
do
rely
on
it
in
this
case
and
i
do
say
that
schneider
against
rusk
is
directly
in
point.
now,
i
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
have
never
placed
this
on
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship,
if
your
honor
please,
that’s
one
reason
why
i
could
see
we
have
tussle
with
the
government
here,
but
i
--
even
though
my
client
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen,
he
is
a
citizen
at
birth
by
statute
and
i
think
under
schneider
against
rusk
and
even
if
schneider
against
rusk
were
not
there,
i
would
say
on
the
basis
of
fundamental
fairness,
this
government
can’t
come
along
to
someone
who
wants
his
citizenship,
who
had
his
passport
for
12
years
as
an
american
citizen
