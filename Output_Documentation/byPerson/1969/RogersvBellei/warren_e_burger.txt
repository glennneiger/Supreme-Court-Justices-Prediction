chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
connolly,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
on
179,
roger's
against
bellei.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
your
earlier
quotation
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
one
who
derives
his
citizenship,
achieves
his
citizenship
by
being
born
in
italy
as
here
with
two
american
parents
then
residing
in
italy
has
less
in
a
way
of
protection
than
an
italian
national
who
came
over
here
and
became
a
citizen
by
naturalization?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
it
follows
from
that,
that
it
does
have
less
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
seem
rather
anomalous?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
period
of
residence
for
an
alien,
is
it
five
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
it
isn't
too
much
to
ask
if
an
american
citizen
who
is
claiming
derivative
citizenship
because
he
was
born
of
an
american
parents
in
europe
or
in
somewhere
else,
ask
him
to
do
the
same
things
that
an
alien
must
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
connolly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
permanent
residents
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
non-tourists?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
of
those
were
military,
does
this
record
show?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
congress
entitled
to
think
that
it
would
be
important
for
the
person
to
go
to
college
or
spend
those
impressionable
years
in
this
country
in
order
to
lay
a
foundation
for
being
a
good
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
might
be
as
justice
harlan's
said,
that's
they
have
the
right
to
make
their
own
mistakes,
but
can
we
correct
it
assuming
it's
a
mistake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
don't
correct
it,
“because
it's
a
mistake.”
we
deal
with
it
because
it
offends
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
what
we
require
to
the
foreign
born
alien,
isn't
it?
the
residents
here
for
five
years,
except
we
don't
pinpoint
it
as
to
age.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
there
a
distinction
because
of
the
age
factor
on
justice
white's
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there's
any
problem
--
if
you
have
any
problem
in
answering
justice
white's
question
on
the
constitutional
side,
then
there
is
a
problem
which
requiring
foreign
born
nationals
or
aliens
of
another
country
to
reside
here
five
years
before
getting
citizenship,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
difference
was
in
the
residence
of
the
parents
isn't
there?
schneider's
parents
were
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rogge.
mr.
connolly,
do
you
have
some
more
for
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
left
mr.
connolly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
connolly.
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you
mr.
rogge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
morning
is
number
24,
rogers
against
bellei.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rogge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
you
have
to
revise
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun
don’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
take
this
man
up
to
age
21
and
he
refuses
to
go
to
an
american
embassy
or
whatever
regulations
would
provide
and
take
the
oath.
since
it
is
a
condition
subsequent,
you
say
that
they
cannot
impose
that
to
his
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
really
wasn’t
making
any
argument,
but
i
was
really
asking
you
a
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what’s
the
source
of
--
by
virtue
of
what
does
that
occur?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
so
that
it
isn’t
an
act
of
congress
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
professor
gardner,
that
congress
could
constitutionally
provide
that
if
on
failing
to
report
for
induction
after
reasonable
notice,
citizenship
in
these
circumstances
could
be
terminated
or
is
that
the
same
kind
of
a
condition
subsequent
as
you
were
challenging
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
tends
to
undermine
at
least
to
some
extent
doesn’t
it,
your
argument
about
having
all
the
burdens
of
citizenship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
come
he
rejects
the
burdens
and
you
say
the
united
states
government
can
do
nothing
about
it,
he
has
rejected
one
very
important
burden
hasn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gardner.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
