mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
legal
question
involved
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
act
of
congress
relating
to
the
citizenship
of
a
child
born
abroad,
one
of
whose
parents
is
an
american
citizen.
the
statutory
provision
in
question
is
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952.
these
are
set
forth
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
45
of
the
government’s
brief
and
continuing
on
to
page
46.
i
would
like
to
read
the
important
portions
of
the
statute.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
45,
the
following
shall
be
nationals
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
at
birth
(7).
a
person
born
outside
the
geographical
limits
of
the
united
states
in
its
outlying
possession
of
parents,
one
of
whom
is
a
alien
and
the
other,
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
prior
to
the
birth
of
such
person
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
or
its
outlying
possession
for
a
period
or
periods
totaling
not
less
than
10
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
attaining
the
age
of
14
years.
and
then
301(b),
any
person
who
is
a
national
and
citizen
of
the
united
states
at
birth
under
paragraph
(7)
of
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
shall
lose
his
nationality
and
citizenship
unless
he
shall
come
to
the
united
states
prior
to
attaining
the
age
of
23
years
and
shall
immediately
following
any
such
coming
be
continuously
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
five
years.
provided
that
such
physical
presence
follows
the
attainment
of
the
age
of
14
years
and
precedes
the
age
of
28
years.
and
i
may
add
that
there
is
another
statute
which
provides
that
the
continuous
presence
is
not
broken
by
absences
which
do
not
exceed
one
year
so
that
he
is
perfectly
possible
to
go
back
for
visits,
but
he
must
have
five
years
without
more
than
a
one
year
break.
the
case
arises
on
the
following
facts
which
were
stipulated
and
thus
are
not
the
subject
of
any
dispute.
the
appellee,
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born
in
italy
in
1939.
his
father
is
an
italian,
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy.
aldo
mario
bellei
became
an
italian
citizen
at
birth.
he
is
an
italian
citizen
today.
thus,
there
is
no
question
of
statelessness
here.
the
appellee’s
mother
was
born
in
the
united
states
and
has
always
been
an
american
citizen.
the
father
and
mother
were
married
in
philadelphia
on
march
14,
1939.
a
few
days
later,
they
left
for
italy
where
the
appellee
was
born
in
december
1939
and
the
family
has
since
recited
in
italy.
at
the
time
of
the
appellee’s
birth,
an
act
of
1934
was
in
effect.
this
is
printed
on
page
44
of
my
brief.
it
was
an
amendment
to
section
1993
of
the
revised
statutes
and
it
provided
that
a
child
in
these
circumstances
is
declared
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
the
rights
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
to
any
such
child
unless
the
citizen
father
or
citizen
mother
as
the
case
maybe
has
resided
in
the
united
states
previous
to
the
birth
of
such
child.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
where
one
of
the
parents
is
an
alien,
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
unless
the
child
comes
to
the
united
states
and
resides
therein
for
at
least
five
years
continuously,
immediately
previous
state
to
his
18th
birthday.
and
unless
within
six
months
after
the
child’s
21st
birthday,
he
or
she
shall
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
of
america
as
prescribed
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
that
statute
in
1934
was
amended
in
1940,
liberalizing
the
time
period
and
casting
it
and
not
in
terms
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
but
in
terms
of
a
statement
that
he
is
a
citizen,
but
that
he
shall
lose
his
citizenship
if
the
condition
is
not
met
and
the
time
provision
was
further
extended
by
the
1952
statute
which
is
the
one
now
in
effect
and
before
the
court.
under
this
statute
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
or
citizen
may
retain
or
perfect
his
citizenship
by
residing
in
the
united
states
for
five
continuous
years,
some
time
between
his
14th
birthday
and
his
28th
birthday.
and
that
means
that
if
he
has
not
started
to
do
that
residence
by
his
23rd
birthday,
then
there
is
no
possibility
if
the
statute
is
valid
that
he
can
retain
his
citizenship
under
the
statute.
the
appellee
here
has
lived
in
italy
most
of
his
life.
recently,
he
took
up
residence
in
england.
he
has
made
five
brief
visits
to
the
united
states,
but
he
has
never
established
residence
in
this
country.
on
his
first
two
trips
in
1948
and
1951,
he
traveled
on
his
mother’s
american
passport.
on
his
next
two
trips
in
1955
and
1962,
he
traveled
on
his
own
united
states
passport
and
this
was
periodically
renewed
until
december
22,
1962.
in
connection
with
the
last
two
renewals
of
this
passport,
he
was
expressly
advised
of
the
need
to
establish
residence
in
the
united
states
prior
to
his
23rd
birthday
if
he
wished
to
retain
his
american
citizenship.
when
he
failed
to
do
so,
the
department
of
state
notified
him
that
he
had
lost
his
united
states
citizenship.
he
came
there
after
to
the
united
states
in
1965
using
an
italian
passport
and
was
admitted
as
an
alien
visitor.
that
too
was
a
temporary
visit.
two
years
later
in
1967,
the
appellee
brought
this
suit
contending
that
the
conditions
for
the
retention
of
citizenship
prescribed
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
are
unconstitutional
and
that
he
has
not
lost
his
citizenship.
when
this
contention
was
sustained
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
the
case
was
brought
here
for
review
on
direct
appeal.
the
decision
below
is
i
think
one
which
shows
the
result
of
an
unduly
conceptual
approach
to
the
problems
in
this
area.
there
are
indeed
two
absolutes
which
have
dominated
thinking
in
this
field.
one
is
reminded
in
the
consideration
of
this
problem
of
the
reference
by
judge
cardozo
nearly
50
years
ago
in
the
nature
of
the
judicial
process
to
the
tendency
of
a
principle
to
expand
itself
to
the
limit
of
his
logic
or
to
home
his
references
to
carrying
things
to
a
dryly
logical
extreme.
one
of
these
absolutes
is
that
all
united
states
citizens
are
exactly
alike
as
far
as
their
citizenship
is
concerned.
under
this
view,
there
can
be
no
variations
whatever
in
any
aspect
of
the
citizenship
of
a
citizen.
a
citizen
is
a
citizen
is
a
citizen.
the
other
absolute
is
that
no
citizen
can
be
deprived
of
his
citizenship
except
by
some
action
which
he
not
only
takes
intentionally,
but
takes
for
the
very
purpose
of
terminating
his
citizenship.
it
is
clear
i
think
that
these
absolutes
find
some
support
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
cases
of
schneider
against
rusk
in
377
u.s.
and
afroyim
against
rusk
in
387
u.s.
on
which
the
court
below
relied.
if
these
propositions
are
truly
absolutes,
then
this
appeal
must
fail.
my
effort
will
be
to
show
that
this
conceptual
approach
is
not
a
sound
one
and
that
there
is
no
appropriate
reason
to
hold
that
citizenship
cannot
be
qualified
in
certain
circumstances
or
that
citizenship
maybe
extended
in
some
cases
including
this
one
in
a
tentative
or
preliminary
or
in
court
manner
which
will
not
come
to
full
maturity
if
certain
requirements
are
not
met.
after
all,
here
is
a
statute
which
is
entirely
fair,
rational,
understandable
and
sensible.
why
it
should
be
thought
to
be
unconstitutional
or
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
violates
is
hard
to
see?
it
is
wholly
clear
i
believe
that
congress
could
have
provided
a
condition
preceding
rather
than
a
condition
subsequent.
that
is
congress
could
have
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
a
citizen
should
not
acquire
citizenship
at
birth,
but
that
he
would
become
a
citizen
by
coming
to
the
united
states
and
residing
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28.
that
would
have
been
niggardly
and
it
would
have
presented
many
practical
problems.
if
the
child
wanted
to
come
here,
he
would
have
to
come
as
a
foreigner.
he
would
travel
on
a
foreign
passport.
he
would
have
to
get
a
visa,
even
though
special
provisions
might
be
made
for
visas
in
such
cases.
when
he
got
here,
he
would
have
to
register
as
an
alien.
if
over
18
or
21,
he
could
not
vote.
if
a
problem
like
the
problem
in
this
case
arose
in
the
fields
of
mathematics
or
the
natural
sciences,
it
would
be
called
a
boundary
problem.
we
want
to
be
generous
in
our
citizenship,
but
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere
and
this
case
is
close
to
that
line.
until
1922,
a
situation
like
this
was
unlikely
to
arise.
until
that
year,
husband
and
wife
were
generally
regarding
as
having
the
same
citizenship
and
that
was
the
husbands.
as
early
as
1790,
congress
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
would
be
a
citizen
if
his
father
was
a
citizen.
at
least
from
1907,
it
was
the
american
law
that
a
wife
lost
her
citizenship
if
she
married
an
alien.
and
this
court
upheld
the
validity
of
that
result
in
mackenzie
against
hare
in
239
u.s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
he
has
been
living
most
recently
in
england.
he
is
not
been
living
in
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
appears
in
the
stipulation,
although
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
close
to
two
years
ago
and
i
don’t
know
where
he
has
been
living
since
that
time,
but
there’s
nothing
that
indicated
that
he
is
been
in
the
united
states.
when
both
parents
are
citizens,
the
family
is
likely
to
be
an
american
family.
and
it
is
appropriate
that
the
children
should
be
american
citizens
even
though
they
are
born
abroad.
but
the
situation
gets
closer
to
the
line
when
only
one
parent
is
a
citizen.
if
the
father
is
foreign
and
the
family
lives
in
his
country
as
was
the
situation
here,
the
chances
are
that
it
is
essentially
a
foreign
family.
at
any
rate,
the
case
for
citizenship
is
not
as
clear
or
may
well
have
seem
to
congress
not
to
be
so
clear.
in
mathematics
and
the
natural
sciences,
it
is
well
recognized
that
when
situation
to
approach
a
boundary
of
one
sort
or
another,
rules
which
otherwise
seem
absolute
may
no
longer
be
absolute.
if
one
examines
water
at
many
different
temperatures,
he
may
well
conclude
that
the
density
of
water
increases
as
the
temperature
decreases
and
that
it
fixed
indefinite
rate.
this
is
more
or
less
a
constant
and
is
known
as
the
co-efficient
of
expansion.
but
it’s
well
known
when
the
temperature
of
water
gets
down
to
four
degrees
centigrade,
the
rule
no
longer
applies.
in
the
area
just
short
of
the
freezing
boundary,
the
density
of
water
decreases
as
the
temperature
goes
down.
sometimes
at
or
near
the
boundary,
things
become
stretched
out,
attenuated.
even
in
the
case
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
relation
of
a
person
to
the
premises
or
the
time
factors
involved
may
make
the
effective
of
violation
so
attenuated
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
no
longer
applicable.
the
rule
or
concept
that
citizenship
is
an
absolute
surely
as
a
very
general
validity,
of
course,
citizenship
in
every
aspect
is
always
subject
to
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clauses.
it
may
never
be
taken
away
arbitrarily,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
there
cannot
be
qualification
or
a
conditions
with
respect
to
citizenship
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
its
acquisition.
as
to
two
classes
of
citizenship,
the
situation
is
constitutionally
clear.
these
maybe
called
fourteenth
amendment
citizens.
in
the
words
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
they
are
all
persons
born
in
the
united
states
and
all
persons
naturalized
in
the
united
states.
there
can
be
no
conditions
or
qualifications
on
their
citizenship
because
the
constitution
gives
them
that
citizenship
as
this
court
has
held
in
kennedy
against
mendoza-martinez
with
respect
to
a
native
born
citizen
and
in
schneider
against
rusk
and
afroyim
against
rusk
with
respect
to
naturalized
citizens.
the
provisions
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
however,
made
no
reference
to
the
citizenship
of
children
born
abroad
of
american
parents;
the
type
of
citizenship
which
is
involved
here.
in
this,
it
followed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
in
the
brief
of
amici
curiae
at
page
9,
it
is
said,
“since
at
that
time,
there
were
doubtless.
no
negro
americans
oversees,
the
amendment
contained
no
reference
to
foreign
born
americans.”
but
i
think
it
may
well
be
suggested
that
this
was
so
and
that
the
omission
may
have
been
intentional.
there
was
the
american
colonization
society
which
undertook
to
settle
liberia,
was
negro
americans.
and
the
constitution
of
liberia
was
written
by
professor
simon
greenleaf
of
the
harvard
law
school.
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
negroes
who
went
to
settle
in
liberia
were
american
citizens.
although
i
know
of
no
evidence
one
way
or
another,
it
may
have
been
the
intention
not
to
provide
that
their
children
should
be
citizens.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
person
born
in
the
united
states
with
respect
to
persons
born
abroad
that
we
may
take
alternative
positions.
we
may
contend
in
the
first
place
that
citizenship
in
such
cases
is
not
acquired
by
naturalization,
but
by
an
independent
power
of
congress.
a
power
in
congress
to
grant
citizenship
according
to
its
judgment,
a
power
which
congress
has
exercised
from
the
time
of
the
first
congress.
only
seven
years
ago,
congress
granted
citizenship
to
sir
winston
churchill.
obviously,
that
cannot
be
rested
on
the
power
of
congress
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
and
congress
has
passed
many
acts
granting
citizenship
to
individuals
whose
citizenship
was
doubtful,
particularly
in
the
case
of
women
who
married
foreigners
and
then
returned
to
the
united
states.
such
a
special
act
was
once
passed
for
the
daughter
of
president
grant.
does
anyone
think
that
these
statutes
were
beyond
the
power
of
congress?
similarly,
congress
has
given
citizenship
to
all
of
the
people
in
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands,
and
before
that
to
all
the
people
in
hawaii
and
alaska,
except
indians
in
alaska
who
were
excluded
in
the
1867
statute.
at
the
last
argument
of
this
case,
it
was
asked
if
congress
could
give
citizenship
to
all
the
people
of
canada.
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
could.
indeed
some
60
years
ago,
there
was
some
talk
of
merger
between
the
united
states
and
canada.
and
if
that
had
progressed
further,
a
grant
of
citizenship
would
obviously
have
been
a
part
of
it.
we
have
a
clear
example
in
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
overruled
the
red
scott
case
and
gave
citizenship
to
a
large
group
of
persons
whom
this
court
had
said,
were
not
citizens
before.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
thought
that
was
true
and
i
tried
to
bring
it
in
as
one
of
my
illustrations.
but
apparently,
it
was
the
states
of
maryland
and
virginia
which
gave
citizenship
to
the
marcus
de
lafayette
and
his
descendants.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
we
could
not
find
any
congressional
statute
to
that
effect.
of
course,
that
illustrates
an
element
in
this
case.
there
were
no
provisions
in
the
constitution
for
the
granting
of
citizenship,
and
to
a
large
extent,
citizenship
was
thought
of
as
a
state
matter.
indeed
many
years
ago
and
going
through
some
old
papers
of
a
law
firm
that
asked
me
to
look
through
them
to
see
which
should
be
burned
and
which
should
be
kept.
i
came
across
a
passport
issued
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
1844.
and
apparently
at
that
time,
that
was
the
normal
way.
you
got
a
state
passport
because
you
were
a
state
citizen.
i
wish
i
could
claim
the
lafayette
statute
and
whether
the
marcus
descendants
are
now
citizens,
i
don’t
know.
so
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
citizenship.
a
power
which
we
believe
it
can
be
said
it
has
exercised
in
enacting
section
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b).
this
is
not
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship
and
there
is
no
reason,
verbal
or
theoretical
why
it
must
be
subject
to
all
the
absolute
conceptions
which
have
been
attached
to
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship.
here
for
good
reasons,
reasons
which
are
surely
valid
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned,
congress
has
attached
the
condition
of
section
301(b).
our
law
is
full
of
such
conditions.
this
can
be
called
“citizenship”,
or
preliminary
citizenship,
or
a
conditional
citizenship.
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
could
not
vest
it
with
great
force
and
significance
unless
and
until
the
condition
is
complied
with.
there
is
no
reason
for
not
giving
effect
to
that
condition
except
the
concept
that
citizenship
is
in
all
cases
and
situations
absolute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
unless
he
can
get
here
before
five
years
between
the
time,
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28,
he
will
lose
his
citizenship.
i
would
venture
the
thought
that
a
young
man
with
an
intense
desire
to
establish
his
connection
with
the
united
states
so
as
to
preserve
his
citizenship
would
find
a
way
to
do
it.
millions
of
people
have
come
to
this
country
with
no
money
and
have
established
themselves
here.
i
think
theoretically,
we
can
make
a
case
of
a
man
who
not
only
has
no
money
but
has
no
initiative
who
can
make
it.
but
if
he
has
the
initiative,
i
think
he
can
make
it
without
the
money.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
this
case.
no
question
about
that
in
this
case.
but
whether
citizenship
is
an
absolute
is
the
issue
here,
to
decide
the
case
on
that
ground
is
to
beg
the
question.
there
is
no
case
decided
by
this
court
which
requires
that
resolution
and
there
is
surely
no
wording
in
the
constitution
which
requires
it.
both
schneider
and
rusk
and
afroyim
against
rusk
involved
regularly
naturalized
citizens
whose
citizenship
was
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
who
obtained
it
only
after
five
years
of
residence
here
as
required
by
the
naturalization
provision.
moreover,
it’s
clear
that
the
privileges
of
citizenship
are
not
necessarily
uniform
and
absolute.
some
can
be
president
and
some
cannot.
some
can
be
representatives
or
senators,
and
some
cannot
until
they
have
resided
here
the
prescribed
time.
some
citizens
can
vote
and
some
cannot
vote,
depending
upon
whatever
the
age
requirement
is.
naturalized
citizenship
can
be
taken
away
for
fraud.
such
persons
are
citizens.
they
would
not
commit
a
crime
if
they
voted,
for
example.
but
their
citizenship
is
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent.
citizens
who
are
in
the
military
are
treated
differently
from
other
citizens.
in
johansson
against
the
united
states
in
225
u.s.
this
court
said
that
a
grant
of
citizenship
was
closely
analogous
to
a
public
grant
of
land
and
this
was
quoted
in
the
schneiderman
case
in
320
u.s.
but
of
course,
a
grant
of
land
including
a
grant
of
public
land
can
be
made
conditional.
a
mining
claim
is
a
grant
of
public
land
and
it
gives
substantial
vested
rights.
but
such
claims
have
long
been
subject
to
a
condition
of
work
performed.
there
is
a
similar
condition
with
respect
to
homestead
claims.
the
homesteader
loses
his
rights
if
he
does
not
live
upon
the
land
and
work
it.
but
beyond
that,
let
us
look
at
this
very
statute:
under
section
301(a)
(7),
citizenship
can
be
transmitted
only
through
a
citizen
parent
“who
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
or
its
outlying
possession
for
a
period
or
periods
totaling
not
less
than
10
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
attaining
the
age
of
14
years.”
thus,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
appellee
is
a
citizen,
he
will
not
be
a
citizen
with
exactly
the
same
qualifications
as
most
other
citizens
or
as
his
mother,
for
she
can
transmit
citizenship
and
he
cannot
unless
and
until
he
meets
the
requirements.
this
qualification
goes
completely
back
to
1790;
an
act
of
the
first
congress
and
it
was
sustained
by
this
court
in
weedin
against
the
chin
bow,
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft
without
dissent.
unless
this
qualification
is
allowed,
it
would
mean
that
the
constitution
requires
that
american
citizenship
maybe
transmitted
endlessly
through
a
single
parent,
generation
after
generation,
even
though
there
is
no
trace
of
any
connection
with
the
united
states
or
any
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
it
seems
an
unnecessarily
bizarre
result.
yet
if
the
condition
of
residence
of
the
parent
is
sustained,
not
every
citizen
has
the
same
qualifications
and
status.
and
let
me
give
another
example
though
a
small
one.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
section
301(a)
(7).
immediately
before
it,
is
section
301(a)
(6)
which
provides
for
citizenship
at
birth
or
(6)
a
person
of
unknown
parentage
found
in
the
united
states
while
under
the
age
of
five
years
until
shown
prior
to
his
attaining
the
age
of
21
years
not
to
have
been
born
in
the
united
states.
now,
this
is
a
sensible
and
humane
provision.
yet
if
it
is
valid
i
hope
it
is,
we
have
another
instance
of
citizenship
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent.
now,
the
other
way
to
look
at
this
problem
is
to
say
that
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
(b)
are
an
exercise
by
congress
of
its
power
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
but
that
like
other
naturalizations,
this
is
a
process
which
takes
time.
it
requires
substantial
proof
of
prospective
allegiance
and
the
individuals
involved
are
not
naturalized
until
the
conditions
are
met.
in
ordinary
naturalization
of
foreigners
within
the
united
states,
a
five-year
period
residence
is
required.
in
the
situation
involved
in
this
case,
many
of
the
incidences
of
citizenship
are
conferred
at
birth.
but
the
naturalization
process
is
not
completed
until
the
residency
requirement
is
met.
and
it
is
that
process
in
its
entirety
to
which
reference
is
made
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it’s
true
of
course
that
the
wording
of
the
statute
as
its
stands
now
speaks
in
terms
of
citizenship
and
not
of
the
naturalization
process.
but
if
a
process
of
naturalization
is
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
given
that
effect
in
law
that
this
was
the
purpose
as
shown
by
the
history
of
the
statutory
provision.
a
precedent
may
indeed
be
found
in
the
welch
case
decided
last
term.
the
problem
there
was
to
make
the
statute
valid
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
view
of
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
first
amendment.
the
situation
here
is
exactly
parallel
if
the
court
does
find
that
there
are
constitutional
difficulties
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
1939
when
the
appellee
was
born,
the
statute
then
in
effect
was
that
of
1934,
printed
on
page
44.
i
have
already
called
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
statute
was
in
terms
of
--
in
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
unless
the
child
comes
to
the
united
states
and
in
addition
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance.
this
sounds
like
a
condition
precedent
rather
than
subsequent.
and
moreover
and
of
first
importance,
isn’t
it
unduly
formalistic
to
make
this
case
turn
on
whether
the
condition
is
precedent
or
subsequent.
it’s
like
talking
about
conditional
remainders
and
springing
uses.
when
the
intention
of
congress
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
due
process
violation
in
giving
effect
to
that
intention
and
no
reason
except
the
purely
conceptual
one
for
denying.
the
relevant
statute
was
amended
in
1940.
this
puts
it
in
condition
subsequent
terms
and
this
was
carried
forward
in
the
1952
revision
involved
here.
but
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
was
anything
other
than
a
verbal
or
stylistic
change
or
that
congress
contemplated
that
it
was
changing
the
law
as
far
as
it
was
applicable
in
this
case.
moreover,
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
naturalization
part
of
the
statute
which
are
applicable
to
a
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
of
citizen.
under
section
320
on
the
nationality
act,
such
a
child
is
naturalized
if
the
alien
parent
is
naturalized
while
the
child
is
under
16
and
the
child
is
resident
in
the
united
states.
and
under
section
322
such
a
child
under
the
age
of
18
years
maybe
naturalized
on
the
application
of
the
citizen
parent,
if
both
are
resident
in
the
united
states.
can
it
be
suppose
that
congress
would
have
made
provision
for
naturalization
of
such
children
within
the
united
states,
if
it
was
the
understanding
of
congress
that
they
were
full
citizens
already?
does
this
not
support
the
view
that
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
(b)
can
be
fairly
and
properly
construed
as
an
essence
naturalization
statutes.
providing
for
a
process
by
which
such
a
child
becomes
a
full
citizen
on
completion
of
the
conditions
prescribed;
conditions
which
are
wholly
appropriate
for
a
naturalization
statute.
finally,
i
would
suggest
a
question
of
separability.
if
section
301(b)
is
invalid,
is
it
clear
that
congress
would
have
enacted
section
301(a)
(7)
as
it
did?
if
congress
could
have
achieved
its
purpose
by
casting
section
301(a)
(7)
in
terms
of
a
condition
subsequent,
is
it
not
clear
that
it
would
not
have
enacted
section
301(a)
(7)
as
it
now
stands
without
enacting
section
301(b)
at
the
same
time?
in
that
event,
should
not
section
301(a)
(7)
fall
if
section
301(b)
falls?
i
submit
that
it
should
thus
giving
congress
a
clean
slate
to
write
upon
in
the
event
that
it
is
purely
formal
choice
of
words
led
to
constitutional
difficulties.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
constitutional
validity
of
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b)
should
be
sustained.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
difficult
for
me
mr.
justice
to
know
what
congress
might
do
in
the
future.
i
think
it’s
very
likely
that
there
would
be
a
recommendation
that
these
statutes
be
reworded
and
then
reenacted
to
provide
that
such
a
person
becomes
a
citizen
if
he
comes
to
the
united
states
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28
and
that
in
the
period
before
he
comes
to
the
united
states,
he
shall
have
certain
rights
of
citizenship
such
as
the
right
to
enter
free
of
porters
and
to
have
perhaps
some
kind
of
a
special
document,
not
a
passport
indicating
his
potential
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
i
think
to
me,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
results
of
by
congress
here
can
be
achieved
in
all
its
details
or
virtually
all
its
details
by
formal,
verbal
changes
even
though
this
court
holds
section
301(b)
invalid
and
i
would
anticipate
that
congress
would
proceed
in
that
line,
not
to
abandon
the
citizenship
for
one-parent-children
born
abroad
entirely,
but
to
subject
it
to
a
condition
precedent
rather
than
a
condition
subsequent
which
seems
to
me
to
emphasize
the
essential
formal
detail,
verbal
nature
of
the
issue
which
is
raised
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
rebuttal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
legal
question
involved
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
act
of
congress
relating
to
the
citizenship
of
a
child
born
abroad,
one
of
whose
parents
is
an
american
citizen.
the
statutory
provision
in
question
is
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952.
these
are
set
forth
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
45
of
the
government’s
brief
and
continuing
on
to
page
46.
i
would
like
to
read
the
important
portions
of
the
statute.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
45,
the
following
shall
be
nationals
and
citizens
of
the
united
states
at
birth
(7).
a
person
born
outside
the
geographical
limits
of
the
united
states
in
its
outlying
possession
of
parents,
one
of
whom
is
a
alien
and
the
other,
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
prior
to
the
birth
of
such
person
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
or
its
outlying
possession
for
a
period
or
periods
totaling
not
less
than
10
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
attaining
the
age
of
14
years.
and
then
301(b),
any
person
who
is
a
national
and
citizen
of
the
united
states
at
birth
under
paragraph
(7)
of
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
shall
lose
his
nationality
and
citizenship
unless
he
shall
come
to
the
united
states
prior
to
attaining
the
age
of
23
years
and
shall
immediately
following
any
such
coming
be
continuously
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
five
years.
provided
that
such
physical
presence
follows
the
attainment
of
the
age
of
14
years
and
precedes
the
age
of
28
years.
and
i
may
add
that
there
is
another
statute
which
provides
that
the
continuous
presence
is
not
broken
by
absences
which
do
not
exceed
one
year
so
that
he
is
perfectly
possible
to
go
back
for
visits,
but
he
must
have
five
years
without
more
than
a
one
year
break.
the
case
arises
on
the
following
facts
which
were
stipulated
and
thus
are
not
the
subject
of
any
dispute.
the
appellee,
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born
in
italy
in
1939.
his
father
is
an
italian,
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy.
aldo
mario
bellei
became
an
italian
citizen
at
birth.
he
is
an
italian
citizen
today.
thus,
there
is
no
question
of
statelessness
here.
the
appellee’s
mother
was
born
in
the
united
states
and
has
always
been
an
american
citizen.
the
father
and
mother
were
married
in
philadelphia
on
march
14,
1939.
a
few
days
later,
they
left
for
italy
where
the
appellee
was
born
in
december
1939
and
the
family
has
since
recited
in
italy.
at
the
time
of
the
appellee’s
birth,
an
act
of
1934
was
in
effect.
this
is
printed
on
page
44
of
my
brief.
it
was
an
amendment
to
section
1993
of
the
revised
statutes
and
it
provided
that
a
child
in
these
circumstances
is
declared
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
the
rights
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
to
any
such
child
unless
the
citizen
father
or
citizen
mother
as
the
case
maybe
has
resided
in
the
united
states
previous
to
the
birth
of
such
child.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
where
one
of
the
parents
is
an
alien,
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
unless
the
child
comes
to
the
united
states
and
resides
therein
for
at
least
five
years
continuously,
immediately
previous
state
to
his
18th
birthday.
and
unless
within
six
months
after
the
child’s
21st
birthday,
he
or
she
shall
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
of
america
as
prescribed
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
that
statute
in
1934
was
amended
in
1940,
liberalizing
the
time
period
and
casting
it
and
not
in
terms
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
but
in
terms
of
a
statement
that
he
is
a
citizen,
but
that
he
shall
lose
his
citizenship
if
the
condition
is
not
met
and
the
time
provision
was
further
extended
by
the
1952
statute
which
is
the
one
now
in
effect
and
before
the
court.
under
this
statute
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
or
citizen
may
retain
or
perfect
his
citizenship
by
residing
in
the
united
states
for
five
continuous
years,
some
time
between
his
14th
birthday
and
his
28th
birthday.
and
that
means
that
if
he
has
not
started
to
do
that
residence
by
his
23rd
birthday,
then
there
is
no
possibility
if
the
statute
is
valid
that
he
can
retain
his
citizenship
under
the
statute.
the
appellee
here
has
lived
in
italy
most
of
his
life.
recently,
he
took
up
residence
in
england.
he
has
made
five
brief
visits
to
the
united
states,
but
he
has
never
established
residence
in
this
country.
on
his
first
two
trips
in
1948
and
1951,
he
traveled
on
his
mother’s
american
passport.
on
his
next
two
trips
in
1955
and
1962,
he
traveled
on
his
own
united
states
passport
and
this
was
periodically
renewed
until
december
22,
1962.
in
connection
with
the
last
two
renewals
of
this
passport,
he
was
expressly
advised
of
the
need
to
establish
residence
in
the
united
states
prior
to
his
23rd
birthday
if
he
wished
to
retain
his
american
citizenship.
when
he
failed
to
do
so,
the
department
of
state
notified
him
that
he
had
lost
his
united
states
citizenship.
he
came
there
after
to
the
united
states
in
1965
using
an
italian
passport
and
was
admitted
as
an
alien
visitor.
that
too
was
a
temporary
visit.
two
years
later
in
1967,
the
appellee
brought
this
suit
contending
that
the
conditions
for
the
retention
of
citizenship
prescribed
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
are
unconstitutional
and
that
he
has
not
lost
his
citizenship.
when
this
contention
was
sustained
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
the
case
was
brought
here
for
review
on
direct
appeal.
the
decision
below
is
i
think
one
which
shows
the
result
of
an
unduly
conceptual
approach
to
the
problems
in
this
area.
there
are
indeed
two
absolutes
which
have
dominated
thinking
in
this
field.
one
is
reminded
in
the
consideration
of
this
problem
of
the
reference
by
judge
cardozo
nearly
50
years
ago
in
the
nature
of
the
judicial
process
to
the
tendency
of
a
principle
to
expand
itself
to
the
limit
of
his
logic
or
to
home
his
references
to
carrying
things
to
a
dryly
logical
extreme.
one
of
these
absolutes
is
that
all
united
states
citizens
are
exactly
alike
as
far
as
their
citizenship
is
concerned.
under
this
view,
there
can
be
no
variations
whatever
in
any
aspect
of
the
citizenship
of
a
citizen.
a
citizen
is
a
citizen
is
a
citizen.
the
other
absolute
is
that
no
citizen
can
be
deprived
of
his
citizenship
except
by
some
action
which
he
not
only
takes
intentionally,
but
takes
for
the
very
purpose
of
terminating
his
citizenship.
it
is
clear
i
think
that
these
absolutes
find
some
support
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
cases
of
schneider
against
rusk
in
377
u.s.
and
afroyim
against
rusk
in
387
u.s.
on
which
the
court
below
relied.
if
these
propositions
are
truly
absolutes,
then
this
appeal
must
fail.
my
effort
will
be
to
show
that
this
conceptual
approach
is
not
a
sound
one
and
that
there
is
no
appropriate
reason
to
hold
that
citizenship
cannot
be
qualified
in
certain
circumstances
or
that
citizenship
maybe
extended
in
some
cases
including
this
one
in
a
tentative
or
preliminary
or
in
court
manner
which
will
not
come
to
full
maturity
if
certain
requirements
are
not
met.
after
all,
here
is
a
statute
which
is
entirely
fair,
rational,
understandable
and
sensible.
why
it
should
be
thought
to
be
unconstitutional
or
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
violates
is
hard
to
see?
it
is
wholly
clear
i
believe
that
congress
could
have
provided
a
condition
preceding
rather
than
a
condition
subsequent.
that
is
congress
could
have
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
a
citizen
should
not
acquire
citizenship
at
birth,
but
that
he
would
become
a
citizen
by
coming
to
the
united
states
and
residing
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28.
that
would
have
been
niggardly
and
it
would
have
presented
many
practical
problems.
if
the
child
wanted
to
come
here,
he
would
have
to
come
as
a
foreigner.
he
would
travel
on
a
foreign
passport.
he
would
have
to
get
a
visa,
even
though
special
provisions
might
be
made
for
visas
in
such
cases.
when
he
got
here,
he
would
have
to
register
as
an
alien.
if
over
18
or
21,
he
could
not
vote.
if
a
problem
like
the
problem
in
this
case
arose
in
the
fields
of
mathematics
or
the
natural
sciences,
it
would
be
called
a
boundary
problem.
we
want
to
be
generous
in
our
citizenship,
but
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere
and
this
case
is
close
to
that
line.
until
1922,
a
situation
like
this
was
unlikely
to
arise.
until
that
year,
husband
and
wife
were
generally
regarding
as
having
the
same
citizenship
and
that
was
the
husbands.
as
early
as
1790,
congress
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
would
be
a
citizen
if
his
father
was
a
citizen.
at
least
from
1907,
it
was
the
american
law
that
a
wife
lost
her
citizenship
if
she
married
an
alien.
and
this
court
upheld
the
validity
of
that
result
in
mackenzie
against
hare
in
239
u.s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
understand
he
has
been
living
most
recently
in
england.
he
is
not
been
living
in
the
united
states.
i
believe
that
appears
in
the
stipulation,
although
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
close
to
two
years
ago
and
i
don’t
know
where
he
has
been
living
since
that
time,
but
there’s
nothing
that
indicated
that
he
is
been
in
the
united
states.
when
both
parents
are
citizens,
the
family
is
likely
to
be
an
american
family.
and
it
is
appropriate
that
the
children
should
be
american
citizens
even
though
they
are
born
abroad.
but
the
situation
gets
closer
to
the
line
when
only
one
parent
is
a
citizen.
if
the
father
is
foreign
and
the
family
lives
in
his
country
as
was
the
situation
here,
the
chances
are
that
it
is
essentially
a
foreign
family.
at
any
rate,
the
case
for
citizenship
is
not
as
clear
or
may
well
have
seem
to
congress
not
to
be
so
clear.
in
mathematics
and
the
natural
sciences,
it
is
well
recognized
that
when
situation
to
approach
a
boundary
of
one
sort
or
another,
rules
which
otherwise
seem
absolute
may
no
longer
be
absolute.
if
one
examines
water
at
many
different
temperatures,
he
may
well
conclude
that
the
density
of
water
increases
as
the
temperature
decreases
and
that
it
fixed
indefinite
rate.
this
is
more
or
less
a
constant
and
is
known
as
the
co-efficient
of
expansion.
but
it’s
well
known
when
the
temperature
of
water
gets
down
to
four
degrees
centigrade,
the
rule
no
longer
applies.
in
the
area
just
short
of
the
freezing
boundary,
the
density
of
water
decreases
as
the
temperature
goes
down.
sometimes
at
or
near
the
boundary,
things
become
stretched
out,
attenuated.
even
in
the
case
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
relation
of
a
person
to
the
premises
or
the
time
factors
involved
may
make
the
effective
of
violation
so
attenuated
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
no
longer
applicable.
the
rule
or
concept
that
citizenship
is
an
absolute
surely
as
a
very
general
validity,
of
course,
citizenship
in
every
aspect
is
always
subject
to
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clauses.
it
may
never
be
taken
away
arbitrarily,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
there
cannot
be
qualification
or
a
conditions
with
respect
to
citizenship
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
its
acquisition.
as
to
two
classes
of
citizenship,
the
situation
is
constitutionally
clear.
these
maybe
called
fourteenth
amendment
citizens.
in
the
words
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
they
are
all
persons
born
in
the
united
states
and
all
persons
naturalized
in
the
united
states.
there
can
be
no
conditions
or
qualifications
on
their
citizenship
because
the
constitution
gives
them
that
citizenship
as
this
court
has
held
in
kennedy
against
mendoza-martinez
with
respect
to
a
native
born
citizen
and
in
schneider
against
rusk
and
afroyim
against
rusk
with
respect
to
naturalized
citizens.
the
provisions
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
however,
made
no
reference
to
the
citizenship
of
children
born
abroad
of
american
parents;
the
type
of
citizenship
which
is
involved
here.
in
this,
it
followed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
in
the
brief
of
amici
curiae
at
page
9,
it
is
said,
“since
at
that
time,
there
were
doubtless.
no
negro
americans
oversees,
the
amendment
contained
no
reference
to
foreign
born
americans.”
but
i
think
it
may
well
be
suggested
that
this
was
so
and
that
the
omission
may
have
been
intentional.
there
was
the
american
colonization
society
which
undertook
to
settle
liberia,
was
negro
americans.
and
the
constitution
of
liberia
was
written
by
professor
simon
greenleaf
of
the
harvard
law
school.
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
negroes
who
went
to
settle
in
liberia
were
american
citizens.
although
i
know
of
no
evidence
one
way
or
another,
it
may
have
been
the
intention
not
to
provide
that
their
children
should
be
citizens.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
person
born
in
the
united
states
with
respect
to
persons
born
abroad
that
we
may
take
alternative
positions.
we
may
contend
in
the
first
place
that
citizenship
in
such
cases
is
not
acquired
by
naturalization,
but
by
an
independent
power
of
congress.
a
power
in
congress
to
grant
citizenship
according
to
its
judgment,
a
power
which
congress
has
exercised
from
the
time
of
the
first
congress.
only
seven
years
ago,
congress
granted
citizenship
to
sir
winston
churchill.
obviously,
that
cannot
be
rested
on
the
power
of
congress
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
and
congress
has
passed
many
acts
granting
citizenship
to
individuals
whose
citizenship
was
doubtful,
particularly
in
the
case
of
women
who
married
foreigners
and
then
returned
to
the
united
states.
such
a
special
act
was
once
passed
for
the
daughter
of
president
grant.
does
anyone
think
that
these
statutes
were
beyond
the
power
of
congress?
similarly,
congress
has
given
citizenship
to
all
of
the
people
in
puerto
rico
and
the
virgin
islands,
and
before
that
to
all
the
people
in
hawaii
and
alaska,
except
indians
in
alaska
who
were
excluded
in
the
1867
statute.
at
the
last
argument
of
this
case,
it
was
asked
if
congress
could
give
citizenship
to
all
the
people
of
canada.
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
could.
indeed
some
60
years
ago,
there
was
some
talk
of
merger
between
the
united
states
and
canada.
and
if
that
had
progressed
further,
a
grant
of
citizenship
would
obviously
have
been
a
part
of
it.
we
have
a
clear
example
in
the
citizenship
clause
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
which
overruled
the
red
scott
case
and
gave
citizenship
to
a
large
group
of
persons
whom
this
court
had
said,
were
not
citizens
before.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
thought
that
was
true
and
i
tried
to
bring
it
in
as
one
of
my
illustrations.
but
apparently,
it
was
the
states
of
maryland
and
virginia
which
gave
citizenship
to
the
marcus
de
lafayette
and
his
descendants.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
we
could
not
find
any
congressional
statute
to
that
effect.
of
course,
that
illustrates
an
element
in
this
case.
there
were
no
provisions
in
the
constitution
for
the
granting
of
citizenship,
and
to
a
large
extent,
citizenship
was
thought
of
as
a
state
matter.
indeed
many
years
ago
and
going
through
some
old
papers
of
a
law
firm
that
asked
me
to
look
through
them
to
see
which
should
be
burned
and
which
should
be
kept.
i
came
across
a
passport
issued
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
1844.
and
apparently
at
that
time,
that
was
the
normal
way.
you
got
a
state
passport
because
you
were
a
state
citizen.
i
wish
i
could
claim
the
lafayette
statute
and
whether
the
marcus
descendants
are
now
citizens,
i
don’t
know.
so
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
citizenship.
a
power
which
we
believe
it
can
be
said
it
has
exercised
in
enacting
section
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b).
this
is
not
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship
and
there
is
no
reason,
verbal
or
theoretical
why
it
must
be
subject
to
all
the
absolute
conceptions
which
have
been
attached
to
fourteenth
amendment
citizenship.
here
for
good
reasons,
reasons
which
are
surely
valid
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned,
congress
has
attached
the
condition
of
section
301(b).
our
law
is
full
of
such
conditions.
this
can
be
called
“citizenship”,
or
preliminary
citizenship,
or
a
conditional
citizenship.
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
could
not
vest
it
with
great
force
and
significance
unless
and
until
the
condition
is
complied
with.
there
is
no
reason
for
not
giving
effect
to
that
condition
except
the
concept
that
citizenship
is
in
all
cases
and
situations
absolute.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice.
unless
he
can
get
here
before
five
years
between
the
time,
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28,
he
will
lose
his
citizenship.
i
would
venture
the
thought
that
a
young
man
with
an
intense
desire
to
establish
his
connection
with
the
united
states
so
as
to
preserve
his
citizenship
would
find
a
way
to
do
it.
millions
of
people
have
come
to
this
country
with
no
money
and
have
established
themselves
here.
i
think
theoretically,
we
can
make
a
case
of
a
man
who
not
only
has
no
money
but
has
no
initiative
who
can
make
it.
but
if
he
has
the
initiative,
i
think
he
can
make
it
without
the
money.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
this
case.
no
question
about
that
in
this
case.
but
whether
citizenship
is
an
absolute
is
the
issue
here,
to
decide
the
case
on
that
ground
is
to
beg
the
question.
there
is
no
case
decided
by
this
court
which
requires
that
resolution
and
there
is
surely
no
wording
in
the
constitution
which
requires
it.
both
schneider
and
rusk
and
afroyim
against
rusk
involved
regularly
naturalized
citizens
whose
citizenship
was
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
who
obtained
it
only
after
five
years
of
residence
here
as
required
by
the
naturalization
provision.
moreover,
it’s
clear
that
the
privileges
of
citizenship
are
not
necessarily
uniform
and
absolute.
some
can
be
president
and
some
cannot.
some
can
be
representatives
or
senators,
and
some
cannot
until
they
have
resided
here
the
prescribed
time.
some
citizens
can
vote
and
some
cannot
vote,
depending
upon
whatever
the
age
requirement
is.
naturalized
citizenship
can
be
taken
away
for
fraud.
such
persons
are
citizens.
they
would
not
commit
a
crime
if
they
voted,
for
example.
but
their
citizenship
is
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent.
citizens
who
are
in
the
military
are
treated
differently
from
other
citizens.
in
johansson
against
the
united
states
in
225
u.s.
this
court
said
that
a
grant
of
citizenship
was
closely
analogous
to
a
public
grant
of
land
and
this
was
quoted
in
the
schneiderman
case
in
320
u.s.
but
of
course,
a
grant
of
land
including
a
grant
of
public
land
can
be
made
conditional.
a
mining
claim
is
a
grant
of
public
land
and
it
gives
substantial
vested
rights.
but
such
claims
have
long
been
subject
to
a
condition
of
work
performed.
there
is
a
similar
condition
with
respect
to
homestead
claims.
the
homesteader
loses
his
rights
if
he
does
not
live
upon
the
land
and
work
it.
but
beyond
that,
let
us
look
at
this
very
statute:
under
section
301(a)
(7),
citizenship
can
be
transmitted
only
through
a
citizen
parent
“who
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
or
its
outlying
possession
for
a
period
or
periods
totaling
not
less
than
10
years,
at
least
five
of
which
were
after
attaining
the
age
of
14
years.”
thus,
if
this
court
holds
that
the
appellee
is
a
citizen,
he
will
not
be
a
citizen
with
exactly
the
same
qualifications
as
most
other
citizens
or
as
his
mother,
for
she
can
transmit
citizenship
and
he
cannot
unless
and
until
he
meets
the
requirements.
this
qualification
goes
completely
back
to
1790;
an
act
of
the
first
congress
and
it
was
sustained
by
this
court
in
weedin
against
the
chin
bow,
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
taft
without
dissent.
unless
this
qualification
is
allowed,
it
would
mean
that
the
constitution
requires
that
american
citizenship
maybe
transmitted
endlessly
through
a
single
parent,
generation
after
generation,
even
though
there
is
no
trace
of
any
connection
with
the
united
states
or
any
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
it
seems
an
unnecessarily
bizarre
result.
yet
if
the
condition
of
residence
of
the
parent
is
sustained,
not
every
citizen
has
the
same
qualifications
and
status.
and
let
me
give
another
example
though
a
small
one.
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
section
301(a)
(7).
immediately
before
it,
is
section
301(a)
(6)
which
provides
for
citizenship
at
birth
or
(6)
a
person
of
unknown
parentage
found
in
the
united
states
while
under
the
age
of
five
years
until
shown
prior
to
his
attaining
the
age
of
21
years
not
to
have
been
born
in
the
united
states.
now,
this
is
a
sensible
and
humane
provision.
yet
if
it
is
valid
i
hope
it
is,
we
have
another
instance
of
citizenship
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent.
now,
the
other
way
to
look
at
this
problem
is
to
say
that
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
(b)
are
an
exercise
by
congress
of
its
power
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
but
that
like
other
naturalizations,
this
is
a
process
which
takes
time.
it
requires
substantial
proof
of
prospective
allegiance
and
the
individuals
involved
are
not
naturalized
until
the
conditions
are
met.
in
ordinary
naturalization
of
foreigners
within
the
united
states,
a
five-year
period
residence
is
required.
in
the
situation
involved
in
this
case,
many
of
the
incidences
of
citizenship
are
conferred
at
birth.
but
the
naturalization
process
is
not
completed
until
the
residency
requirement
is
met.
and
it
is
that
process
in
its
entirety
to
which
reference
is
made
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it’s
true
of
course
that
the
wording
of
the
statute
as
its
stands
now
speaks
in
terms
of
citizenship
and
not
of
the
naturalization
process.
but
if
a
process
of
naturalization
is
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
given
that
effect
in
law
that
this
was
the
purpose
as
shown
by
the
history
of
the
statutory
provision.
a
precedent
may
indeed
be
found
in
the
welch
case
decided
last
term.
the
problem
there
was
to
make
the
statute
valid
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
view
of
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
first
amendment.
the
situation
here
is
exactly
parallel
if
the
court
does
find
that
there
are
constitutional
difficulties
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
1939
when
the
appellee
was
born,
the
statute
then
in
effect
was
that
of
1934,
printed
on
page
44.
i
have
already
called
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
statute
was
in
terms
of
--
in
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
not
descend
unless
the
child
comes
to
the
united
states
and
in
addition
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance.
this
sounds
like
a
condition
precedent
rather
than
subsequent.
and
moreover
and
of
first
importance,
isn’t
it
unduly
formalistic
to
make
this
case
turn
on
whether
the
condition
is
precedent
or
subsequent.
it’s
like
talking
about
conditional
remainders
and
springing
uses.
when
the
intention
of
congress
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
due
process
violation
in
giving
effect
to
that
intention
and
no
reason
except
the
purely
conceptual
one
for
denying.
the
relevant
statute
was
amended
in
1940.
this
puts
it
in
condition
subsequent
terms
and
this
was
carried
forward
in
the
1952
revision
involved
here.
but
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
was
anything
other
than
a
verbal
or
stylistic
change
or
that
congress
contemplated
that
it
was
changing
the
law
as
far
as
it
was
applicable
in
this
case.
moreover,
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
naturalization
part
of
the
statute
which
are
applicable
to
a
child
born
abroad
with
one
parent
of
citizen.
under
section
320
on
the
nationality
act,
such
a
child
is
naturalized
if
the
alien
parent
is
naturalized
while
the
child
is
under
16
and
the
child
is
resident
in
the
united
states.
and
under
section
322
such
a
child
under
the
age
of
18
years
maybe
naturalized
on
the
application
of
the
citizen
parent,
if
both
are
resident
in
the
united
states.
can
it
be
suppose
that
congress
would
have
made
provision
for
naturalization
of
such
children
within
the
united
states,
if
it
was
the
understanding
of
congress
that
they
were
full
citizens
already?
does
this
not
support
the
view
that
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
(b)
can
be
fairly
and
properly
construed
as
an
essence
naturalization
statutes.
providing
for
a
process
by
which
such
a
child
becomes
a
full
citizen
on
completion
of
the
conditions
prescribed;
conditions
which
are
wholly
appropriate
for
a
naturalization
statute.
finally,
i
would
suggest
a
question
of
separability.
if
section
301(b)
is
invalid,
is
it
clear
that
congress
would
have
enacted
section
301(a)
(7)
as
it
did?
if
congress
could
have
achieved
its
purpose
by
casting
section
301(a)
(7)
in
terms
of
a
condition
subsequent,
is
it
not
clear
that
it
would
not
have
enacted
section
301(a)
(7)
as
it
now
stands
without
enacting
section
301(b)
at
the
same
time?
in
that
event,
should
not
section
301(a)
(7)
fall
if
section
301(b)
falls?
i
submit
that
it
should
thus
giving
congress
a
clean
slate
to
write
upon
in
the
event
that
it
is
purely
formal
choice
of
words
led
to
constitutional
difficulties.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
constitutional
validity
of
sections
301(a)
(7)
and
301(b)
should
be
sustained.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it’s
difficult
for
me
mr.
justice
to
know
what
congress
might
do
in
the
future.
i
think
it’s
very
likely
that
there
would
be
a
recommendation
that
these
statutes
be
reworded
and
then
reenacted
to
provide
that
such
a
person
becomes
a
citizen
if
he
comes
to
the
united
states
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28
and
that
in
the
period
before
he
comes
to
the
united
states,
he
shall
have
certain
rights
of
citizenship
such
as
the
right
to
enter
free
of
porters
and
to
have
perhaps
some
kind
of
a
special
document,
not
a
passport
indicating
his
potential
citizenship
in
the
united
states.
i
think
to
me,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
results
of
by
congress
here
can
be
achieved
in
all
its
details
or
virtually
all
its
details
by
formal,
verbal
changes
even
though
this
court
holds
section
301(b)
invalid
and
i
would
anticipate
that
congress
would
proceed
in
that
line,
not
to
abandon
the
citizenship
for
one-parent-children
born
abroad
entirely,
but
to
subject
it
to
a
condition
precedent
rather
than
a
condition
subsequent
which
seems
to
me
to
emphasize
the
essential
formal
detail,
verbal
nature
of
the
issue
which
is
raised
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
rebuttal.
