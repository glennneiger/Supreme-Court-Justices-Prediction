well
then,
i
take
it
would
follow
that
you
agree
that
congress
need
not
vest
a
person
in
his
position
with
citizenship
if
it
chooses
not
to
do
so.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
having
--
however
having
granted,
it
is
your
position
that
schneider
against
rusk
is
in
controlling
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i’ll
ask
to
you
then
the
same
question
i
asked
the
solicitor
general.
do
you
think
if
this
case
is
affirmed
that
congress
might
repeal
the
statute
if
its
intention
was
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
i
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
that
you
would
have
no
objection
to
the
requirement
that
they
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
at
age
21?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
then
a
condition
subsequent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
would
failure
or
refusal
to
take
such
an
oath
result
in
non
continuation
of
citizenship,
is
that
the
import
of
justice
marshall’s
question
that
you
understood?
