justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
rogge,
you
said
--
under
your
argument,
would
you
reach
the
same
result
if
congress
had
said
that
children
of
american
--
of
one
american
parent
born
abroad
will
become
a
citizen,
but
only
upon
residing
in
this
country
for
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
could
say
you
can't
become
a
citizen
until
unless
you
come
here
for
five
years
between
the
ages
of
14
and
28?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
be
irrational?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you're
making
the
argument
about
rationality
and
i
just,
i
have
some
troubles
seeing
differences
between
the
cases
in
terms
of
rationality?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
there
isn't
any
difference
between
the
two
cases,
you
haven't
lost
their
case
yet?
i
mean,
let's
assume
it's
wholly
rational,
it's
still
a
question
of
summary
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
just
say
in
your
early
argument
is
that
the
restriction
is
irrational
and
it's
void?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
with
this
court
should
affirm,
do
you
anticipate
that
congress
might
repeal
the
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
this
--
if
schneider
against
rusk,
the
person
haven’t
been
a
naturalized
citizen,
she
wouldn’t
have
lost
her
citizenship
at
all.
because
that’s
the
only
--
the
only
people
would
lose
citizenship
were
naturalized
citizens.
and
both
the
majority
in
the
dissent
referred
to
angelica
schneider’s
a
naturalized
citizen
and
the
very
provision
which
was
claimed
to
porter
or
citizenship
refers
only
to
naturalized
citizens.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
provision
by
which
she
was
supposedly
was
going
to
lose
her
citizenship
says
if
a
person
who
has
become
national
by
naturalization,
so
the
section
wouldn’t
even
apply
if
you
are
right.
there
would
have
been
any
problem
in
the
whole
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
sure
we
have
a
difference,
we
just
read
the
statute.
well
i
guess
to
that
extent,
we
may
have
a
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
if
due
process
clause
has
this
whammy?
you
wouldn’t
care
whether
she
was
a
naturalized
citizen
or
not
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
she
was
a
naturalized
citizen,
you’d
make
the
same
argument,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
should
you?
why
should
you
if
due
process
clause
has
this
much
of
an
impact
or
this
reach,
it
would
reach
naturalized
citizens
as
well
as
non-naturalized
citizens.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
you
have
to,
you
easily
could.
i
mean,
you
could
make
the
same
argument
about
the
due
process
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
a
fortiori.
you
could
make
it
as
if
she
was
a
naturalized
citizen.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
fortiori.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
whether
--
and
schneider
was
a
naturalized
citizen?
well
excuse
me,
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
well
be
true,
but
if
you
can
rely
on
the
due
process
clause
in
this
case,
surely
you
could
in
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
would
if
the
descenders
had
prevailed
on
the
one
point
in
the
case,
in
schneider
against
rusk,
you
most
certainly
would
have
had
to
rely
on
the
due
process
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gardner,
enlighten
me
on
that
last
comment
because
i
saw
it
in
the
brief
also,
isn’t
this
demanded
of
resident
aliens
just
as
much
as
of
citizens?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
hence,
i
fail
to
see
the
significance
of
this
comment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
this
mr.
gardner
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
once
more
mr.
gardner,
going
back
to
this
military
service
thing.
wouldn’t
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
whether
or
not
your
client
was
willing
to
perform
military
service?
if
you
prevail
as
you
have
your
client
is
an
american
citizen
and
he
may
never
come
back
here
and
hence,
i
ask
how
will
military
service
on
his
part
ever
be
compelled?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
this
brings
me
back
again
to
inquire
whether
the
argument
done
has
any
particular
merit
in
this
context
as
to
whether
he
is
willing
or
is
not
wiling,
because
you
benefit
if
you
prevail,
you
benefit
either
class.
