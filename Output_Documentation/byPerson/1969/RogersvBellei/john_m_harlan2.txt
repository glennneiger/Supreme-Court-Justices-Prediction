i'd
like
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
of
the
constitutional
source.
if
there
is
now
a
constitutional
authority
for
the
issue
on
your
case,
would
that
warrant
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
you
think
those
are
arguments
that
are
a
little
bit
strong
that
this
policy
arguments
that
they
are
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
didn't
understand
the
government
to
be
arguing
that
there.
their
argument
is
that
this
is
irrational
thing
to
do.
they
might
disagree
on
lots
of
times
as
i
understand
it
is
that
depending
on
their
mistakes
is
their
argument
is
in
their
power?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
way
to
see
what
we
decide
[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
statute
which
you
rephrased
in
terms
of
like
in
the
condition
receiving
as
required
as
opposed
to
condition
we
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
organization
may
(inaudible)
change
of
the
law?
