justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
connolly,
if
the
constitutional
stand
would
have
be
that
one
can't
lose
citizenship
without
voluntarily
giving
it
up,
i
take
it
this
argument
wouldn't
hold,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
could
you
win
it,
if
that
were
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
a
voluntary
relinquishment
were
the
standard
you
would
probably
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
--
what
then
should
constitutional
authority
of
congress
to
make
him
an
american
citizen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
under
that
power
could
the
congress
make
every
resident
of
canada
or
every
canadian
an
american
citizen
really
by
legislation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
to
suggest
that
instead
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
might
have
enacted
a
statute
which
overruled
the
dread
scott?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
there
any
traditional
challenges
to
that
kind
of
legislation,
before
the
adaption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it
was
thought
that
that
was
just
a
little
support?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
connolly,
on
that
point,
if
you
were
right
constitutionally
in
these
situations,
the
congressional
regulation,
then
what
is
the
left
of
the
argument
of
voluntary
relinquishment
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that
standard
isn't
a
standard
at
all,
it
would
apply
on
the
constitutionally
conferred
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
statute
apply
to
the
children
--
of
our
military
stations
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
answer
of
my
question
is
“yes,
it
does,”
that
this
statute
would
on
the
proper
facts
applied,
the
children
born
to
our
military
stations
abroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
take
this
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
the
american
is
in
our
military?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
was
interested
in
talking
about
is
if
this
statute
is
applicable
and
the
one
american
parent
is
in
our
military
and
the
child
is
born
abroad,
does
this
statute
apply
to
affect
that
child's
american
citizenship,
that's
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
rogge,
do
you
rely
to
all
on
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
i
take
it
or
doesn't,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
voluntary
relinquishment
--
where
do
you
get
this,
if
you
don't
get
it
under
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
i
gather
this
--
the
basic
constitutional
authority
here
is
the
power
of
the
congress,
to
enact
uniform
naturalization
laws.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
opened
by
saying
something
to
us
about
“he
could
loose
it
except
by
voluntary
relinquishment”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
make
that
argument
based
on
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
just
as
part
of
your
irrationality
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
connolly,
would
this
reach
a
situation
of
the
american
parents
who
is
in
the
military
abroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
must
have
a
lot
of
situations
like
that
i
guess.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
lot
of
american
military
men
are
marrying
german
girls
and
koreans,
everyone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
connolly,
if
the
constitutional
stand
would
have
be
that
one
can't
lose

without

i
