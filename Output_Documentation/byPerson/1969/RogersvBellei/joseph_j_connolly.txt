mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
calls
into
question
the
constitutionality
on
an
act
of
congress.
the
statute
involved
as
part
of
section
301
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
this
statute
is
set
forth
on
page
45
and
46
of
our
brief.
section
301
(a)
(7)
includes
among
those
who
are
declared
to
be
citizens
of
united
states
at
birth.
persons
who
are
born
abroad
of
one
alien
parent
and
of
one
citizen
parent
who
has
resided
for
a
specified
time
in
the
united
states.
section
301
(b)
provides
that
such
persons
that
is
person
foreign
born
persons
who
derive
their
american
citizenship
from
one
american
parent,
must
come
to
the
united
states
prior
to
their
23rd
birthday
and
remain
here
continuously
for
five
years,
prior
to
reaching
age
28
in
order
to
retain
their
american
citizenship.
another
section
of
the
code
provides
that
absences
from
the
united
states
of
less
than
12
months
in
the
aggregate
will
not
break
the
required
continuity
of
the
physical
presence
in
the
united
states.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
stipulated
and
can
be
stated
quite
briefly.
the
appellee,
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born
in
italy
in
december
1939.
his
father
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy,
although
bellei
became
an
italian
citizen
at
birth
and
is
an
italian
citizen
today.
he
also
acquired
american
citizenship
at
birth
under
the
predecessor
of
section
301
(a)
(7),
because
his
mother
had
been
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states
and
was
an
american
citizen.
appellee
resided
in
italy
from
the
time
of
his
birth
until
recently,
when
he
moved
from
italy
to
england.
prior
to
his
23rd
birthday,
he
made
four
brief
visits
to
united
states,
the
longest
of
these
being
four
months
in
duration.
on
several
occasions,
when
he
applied
for
renewals
of
his
united
states
passport,
he
was
advised
by
american
consul
officials
that
he
must
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
period
of
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states.
when
the
appellee
did
not
heed
these
warnings
and
remained
in
italy
past
his
24th
birthday,
his
passport
was
canceled
on
the
ground
that
he
was
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
thereafter,
the
appellee
instituted
this
suit
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
premised
on
the
contention
of
section
301
(b)
is
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
district
court
sustained
the
appellee's
claim
to
american
citizenship,
holding
section
301
(b)
unconstitutional
on
the
authority
of
this
court's
decisions
in
schneider
versus
rusk
and
afroyim
versus
rusk.
the
government
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
we
argue
in
this
case
that
the
type
of
citizenship
involved
here
is
of
an
entirely
different
type
than
that
involved
in
schneider
and
afroyim,
that
it
owes
it's
existence
entirely
to
legislative
judgment
and
that
the
provision
for
it's
termination
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
same
authority
by
which
appellee
citizenship
was
created.
we
contend
further
that
a
decision
sustaining
this
statute
would
not
undermine
the
principles
on
which
this
court's
previous
decisions
rested.
we
build
our
argument
on
the
following
points.
first,
there
is
no
claim
that
section
301
(b)
is
a
penal
law,
either
in
its
intent
or
in
its
effect.
residents
abroad
is
not
a
criminal
or
reprehensible
act
declared
by
the
american
government
or
by
the
american
people.
the
loss
of
citizenship
is
in
no
way
intended
to
punish
such
absence
from
the
united
states.
therefore,
the
principals
which
underlay
this
court's
decision
in
mendoza
martinez
are
not
applicable
here.
second,
the
laws
of
nationality
under
section--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
our
case
would
be
much
more
difficult,
i
would
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
we
could
make
a
contention
that
absence
abroad
of
extremely
long
duration
may
indicate
of
voluntary
relinquishment
of
american
citizenship.
but
then
we
would
be
struck
with
a
counter
argument,
premised
on
schneider
that
we
would
be
distinguishing
between
this
class
of
american
--
unreasonably
distinguishing
between
this
class
of
american
citizens
and
other
citizens
who
require
their
citizenship
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
that
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
and
we're
contending
quite
forcefully
in
this
case
that
voluntary
relinquishment
is
not
necessarily
the
standard
because
of
the
like
fourteenth
amendment
foundation.
our
second
point
is
that
the
laws
of
nationality
under
section
301
unlike
the
statute
involved
in
trote
versus
dallas,
does
not
create
the
risk
of
statelessness,
which
concerned
chief
justice
warren
in
that
case.
the
legislative
history
set
out
in
our
brief
shows
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
dual
nationality
and
the
protection
of
persons
abroad
who
held
american
citizenship
for
owing
primary
and
permanent
allegiance
to
another
country.
to
such
persons,
the
laws
of
american
citizenship
does
not
result
in
statelessness.
they
simply
retain
the
citizenship
of
the
country
to
which
they
have
shown
their
principal
attachment.
in
this
case,
the
appellee
is,
and
always
has
been,
a
citizen
of
italy.
our
third
point,
and
this
is
a
critical
point
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
court's
recent
precedence
in
the
area
is
that
the
type
of
citizenship
involved
here
does
not
derive
any
constitutional
protection
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
afroyim
versus
rusk,
found
in
first
section
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
protection
against
involuntary
expatriation
for
those
persons
whose
citizenship
was
declared
by
that
sentence.
the
process
by
which
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
held
to
include
certain
substantive
guarantees
and
the
type
and
scope
of
these
guarantees
are
matters
which
i
confess
are
not
entirely
clear
to
me.
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
whatever
those
rights
may
be,
they
are
in
guaranteed
only
to
those
persons
whose
citizenship
is
declared
by
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
reads,
“all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
other
state
wherein
they
reside.”
the
appellee
of
course
was
not
born
in
the
united
states.
there
may
be
some
questions
whether
he
acquired
his
citizenship
by
naturalization
although
it
is
not
pressed
that
contention.
we
doubt
whether
section
301
(a)
(7)
can
be
considered
in
naturalization
statute
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
can
find
no
authority
that
the
reconstruction
congress
view
the
statutory
acquisition
of
citizenship
at
birth
as
part
of
the
naturalization
process.
but
even
of
it
is
assumed
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
that
is
not
entirely
clear.
the
court
below
passed
over
the
point
in
its
opinion
and
in
our
brief
we
agreed
that
there
was
constitutional
authority
to
grant
this
type
of
citizenship.
we
suggest
that
that
have
might
be
premised
on
the
naturalization
clause
and
it
might
be
premised
upon
the
congress'
inherent
powers,
the
legislative
body
of
a
sovereign
to
declare
the
classes
of
persons
who
will
be
considered
as
citizens.
my
own
research
in
the
area
leads
me
to
conclude
that
the
creation
of
this
class
of
citizenship
is
in
the
exercise
of
an
inherent
power
rather
than
the--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
perhaps
could.
the
basis
for
my
conclusion
is
that
the
congress
--
according
to
the
english
precedent
where
the
use
solely
was
the
fundamental
law
of
citizenship,
but
as
i'll
show
later,
was
amended
by
the
parliament
in
1350
to
provide
for
a
limited
grant
of
citizenship
to
children
born
of
british
nationals
overseas.
that
the
english
authorities
viewed
that
as
of
the
same
order
of
creation
of
citizenship
as
the
natural
law
of
use
solely,
and
that
it
wasn't
considered
to
be
part
of
the
naturalization
process
which
proceeded
separately
by
separate
statutes.
i
believe
that
that
was
the
approach
which
the
founding
fathers
had
in
the
constitution
that
is
to
the
extent
that
this
power
is
existing
in
congress,
it
exists
as
a
natural
incident
of
the
sovereignty
and
there
is
very
limited
authority
to
cite
for
that.
the
very
first
statute
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
so,
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
his
citizenship
would
not
be
derived.
it
would
gain
no
protection
from
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
does
follow
from
that,
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
take
care
of
a
particular
problem
in
the
united
states
at
that
time
in
securing
of
the
right
of
citizenship
to
the
newly
freed
slaves
and
it
since
had
been
interpreted
more
broadly
to
have
rights
involving
rights
associated
with
the
preservation
of
citizenship.
but
insofar
as
the
citizenship
is
to
be
created
by
the
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
define
citizens
of
the
united
states,
then
it
must
be
admitted
that
that
power
has
--
that
included
within
that
power
is
the
authority
to
impose
reasonable
conditions
upon
that
citizenship.
that
power
in
afroyim
holds,
perhaps
was
taken
away
in
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
citizens
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
insofar
as
our
constitutional
principles
are
concerned,
we
argue
that
where
the
citizenship
is
created
entirely
by
statute
and
in
exercise
of
congressional
judgment,
that
reasonable
conditions
may
be
imposed.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
we
don't
make
that
argument.
we
do
not
argue
that
congress
lacks
the
authority
to
make
adverse
citizens
of
the
united
states,
those
who
were
born
abroad.
mr.
justice
brennan,
just
to
complete
my
answer
to
your
question,
some
limited
authority
for
my
proposition
comes
from
the
very
first
law
containing
this
provision
providing
for
grant
of
citizenship
to
children
born
abroad.
in
that
law,
which
was
passed
by
the
first
congress
in
1790,
it
says
that,
“and
the
children
of
citizens
of
the
united
states,
that
maybe
born
beyond
sea
or
out
of
the
limits
of
the
united
states,
shall
be
considered
as
natural
born
citizens.”
we
suggest
there
was
in
the
exercise
of
its
naturalization
authority
under
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i'm
not
aware
of
any
mr.
justice.
we
take
the
position
that
even
if
it
is
assumed,
that
the
appellee
acquired
his
citizenship
by
naturalization,
it
still
would
not
come
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
so
because
he
was
neither
naturalized
in
the
unites
states
nor
was
he
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
when
he
acquired
his
citizenship.
the
history
of
the
amendment
confirms
when
its
language
unmistakably
contemplates
that
it
was
directed
to
events
occurring
in
the
united
states.
this
was
well
settled
by
what
mr.
justice
douglas
has
called,
the
historic
decision
in
the
united
states
versus
wong
kim
ark
and
i
would
like
to
quote
certain
passages
from
the
opinion,
this
is
169
u.s.,
at
687.
“and
from
1795,
the
provision
of
those
acts
which
granted
citizenship
to
foreign
born
children
of
american
parents,
describes
such
children
as
born
out
of
the
limits
and
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
thus
congress,
when
dealing
with
the
question
of
citizenship
in
that
aspect,
treated
aliens
residing
in
this
country
as
“under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states”
an
american
parents
residing
abroad
as
“out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
passing
onto
page
688,
this
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
declaratory
of
existing
rights,
it's
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
affirmative
of
existing
law,
as
to
each
of
the
qualifications
therein
expressed,
born
in
the
united
states,
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof.
in
short,
as
to
everything
relating
to
the
acquisition
of
citizenship,
by
facts
occurring
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states,
but
it
has
not
touched
the
acquisition
of
citizenship
by
being
born
abroad
of
american
parents
and
has
left
that
subject
to
be
regulated
as
it
had
always
been
by
congress.
in
the
exercise
of
the
power,
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization,
so
there
is
contrary
suggestion
by
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
is
support
for
the
other
proposition.
i
expressed
earlier
as
my
own
conclusion.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
it
is
not
exclusive
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
except
for
the
naturalization.
the
citation
from
wong
kim
ark
leads
to
our
fourth
point.
that
lacking
any
constitutional
protection,
the
citizenship
which
appellee
enjoyed
is
dependent
entirely
for
its
existence
and
its
rights
on
congressional
enactments.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
on
congressional
enactments.
this
was
established
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
by
mr.
horace
benny,
in
his
study
which
is
thrice
been
cited
by
this
court
with
approval,
it
appears
in
2
american
law
register.
at
common
law,
the
foreign-born
child
of
english
citizens
did
not
inherit
the
right
of
english
citizenship
and
such
a
child
was
treated
as
an
alien
in
england.
the
first
statute
to
remedy
this
was
passed
in
1350,
the
25th
year
of
the
reign
of
edward
iii.
that
statute
which
granted
citizenship
at
birth
to
a
child
born
abroad
of
two
english
parents,
and
subsequent
statutes
on
the
same
subject
were
construed
strictly
by
the
english
courts.
this
court's
decision
is
montana
versus
kennedy,
decided
nine
years
ago,
puts
to
rest
any
notions
that
the
rights
of
children
born
abroad
to
american
parents
are
greater
than
what
congress
has
provided
in
its
citizenship
laws.
the
petitioner
in
that
case
was
born
in
italy
to
an
italian
father
and
an
american
mother
in
1906,
when
the
law
provided
for
citizenship
by
inheritance
only
from
american
fathers.
shortly
after
his
birth,
he
was
brought
to
the
united
states
where
he
resided
continuously
for
50
years
without
ever
been
naturalized.
when
the
government
sought
to
deport
him
as
an
alien,
be
brought
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
of
the
citizenship.
eight
justices
of
this
court
held
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
of
theunited
states
because
he
did
not
come
literally
within
the
grant
of
citizenship
in
the
statute.
surely,
a
federal
common
law
where
the
constitution
afforded
any
rights
of
citizenship
to
the
foreign
born,
they
would
have
been
exercised
in
favor
of
this
man
who
had
resided
in
this
country
for
more
than
50
years.
on
the
basis
of
the
foregoing
points,
the
primary
question
presented
in
our
view
is
whether
the
congress
in
the
exercise
of
this
power
to
grant
citizenship
to
the
foreign
born
children
of
american
citizens,
they
condition
that
grant
on
the
child's
coming
to
live
in
the
united
states
for
a
certain
period.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
voluntary
relinquishment
mr.
justice
in
our
view
is
inapplicable
here.
that
is
not
a
test
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
correct.
the
legislative
history
of
the
requirement
of
five
years
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states
shows
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
unsatisfactory
status
of
persons
abroad,
having
both
american
citizenship
and
citizenship
in
another
country.
this
was
and
it
is
today
a
legitimate
concern.
the
presence
of
american
citizens
abroad
imposes
on
our
government
a
duty
to
assure
proper
treatment
of
their
persons
and
property.
the
carrying
out
of
this
duty
inevitably
results
in
international
conflicts
with
the
other
nation
which
also
regards
the
individual
as
its
citizens.
an
examination
of
any
of
the
several
textbooks
on
nationality
will
reveal
that
there
are
many
types
of
conflicts
which
may
develop
on
matters
such
as
reparations,
protests,
and
claims
for
lawsuits,
and
it
also
would
reveal
that
the
fact
that
the
law
has
not
settled
on
the
resolution
of
many
of
these
conflicts.
these
conflicts
are
to
bar
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
serious
problems,
inevitably
implicating
nationality.
to
continue
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
mendoza
martinez,
“we
have
recognized
the
entanglements
which
may
stem
from
dual
allegiance,
and
have
twice
sustained
statutes
which
provide
for
the
loss
of
american
citizenship
upon
the
deliberate
assumption
of
a
foreign
attachment.”
the
congress
recognized
that
an
unconditional
granting
of
american
citizenship
solely
because
that
one
of
the
individual's
parents
was
an
american
citizen,
meant
that
our
government
would
risk
involvement
in
such
international
disputes
on
behalf
of
persons
who
had
no
attachment
or
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
this
much,
the
court
below
also
recognized.
it
said,
“there
is
an
undeniable
danger
that
children
born
and
raised
abroad,
in
a
foreign
home
where
english
may
never
be
spoken,
school
where
english
is
not
thought,
celebrating
foreign
holidays
with
the
family
of
the
non-american
parent,
will
have
no
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states,
its
culture
or
heritage.
it
is
a
legitimate
concern
of
congress
that
those
who
bear
american
citizenship
and
receive
its
benefits
have
some
nexus
to
the
united
states.”
plus,
the
congress
decided
that
in
continuing
the
grant
of
american
citizenship,
to
foreign
born
persons
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply,
it
was
desirable
to
reduce
the
risk
that
there
would
be
class
of
citizens
living
permanently
abroad
having
no
attachment
to
the
united
states.
it
sought
to
achieve
this
goal
as
it
had
done
under
the
naturalization
laws
by
requiring
a
period
of
residence
in
this
country.
in
light
of
the
considerations
which
prompted
in,
we
think
that
this
requirement
is
entirely
reasonable.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
it
is
five
years,
for
naturalization.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
something
along
that
line.
it
says
that
the
same
considerations
which
prompted
congress
to
require
a
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states
for
aliens,
to
make
sure
that
they
have
some
association
with
life
in
the
unites
states,
are
the
same
considerations
which
prompted
the
congress
to
enact
this
particular
requirement
and
in
this
case,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
presence
of
such
people
abroad
imposes
versions
of
the
united
states
in
it's
diplomatic
representations.
the
final
question
then
is
whether
congress
may
constitutionally,
make
a
residence
requirement,
a
condition
of
the
continuation
of
this
statutory
citizenship
rather
than
the
acquisition
of
the
citizenship.
the
congress
of
course
could
have
provided
that
children
born
abroad
of
one
american
parent
shall
become
citizens
after
a
period
of
residence
in
this
country.
but
this
would
have
had
unfortunate
consequences
during
the
child's
minority
when
the
american
parent
could
not
be
rely
on
american
diplomatic
protection
for
his
or
her
child.
it
also
would
have
created
novel
problems
of
status
and
rights
when
the
child
returned
to
this
country
in
order
to
fulfill
his
residence
requirement.
so
the
congress
would
like
to
declare
the
minor
child
as
citizen,
but
to
condition
the
grant
of
lifetime
citizenship,
when
the
child's
coming
to
the
united
states
and
residing
here
for
a
period
of
time.
this
too
we
think
was
a
reasonable
decision
by
the
congress.
it
did
not
violate
the
due
process
rights
of
the
appellee
and
others
affected
by
the
statute.
appellee
had
american
diplomatic
protection
during
his
minority
when
he
was
dependent
on
his
parents.
there
was
no
contention
that
he
suffered
any
disability
or
any
prejudice
by
reason
of
being
an
american
citizen
during
his
minority.
when
he
came
of
age,
the
congress
in
effect
asked
him
the
question
that
it
properly
could
ask
in
granting
citizenship
to
such
persons.
is
your
sole
allegiance
to
the
united
states
or
is
your
allegiance
to
italy
where
you
were
born
and
raised,
where
you
went
to
school,
where
you
worked
and
married?
the
congress
asked
only
that
he
come
to
this
country
and
be
part
of
it's
life
for
five
years.
there
is
no
reason
apparent
for
the
appellee's
failure
to
do
so
other
than
that
he
was
too
deeply
involved
in
activities
in
his
homeland.
for
us,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
he
should
be
able
to
command
united
states
citizenship
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
may
i
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
gordon
advices
that
the
statute
is
applicable
to
the
child
of
an
american
service
men
or
women
overseas,
married
to
an
alien?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
there
are
those
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
those
situations
provide
no
difficulty
under
this
statute
because
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
marriage
and
the
development
of
the
child,
serviceman
is
rotated
back
to
the
united
states,
there's
usually
no
intention
in
those
cases
to
relinquish
american
residency
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
that's
entirely
possible
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
they
return
back
to
the
united
states,
the
child
is
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
sir.
mr.
rogge
i
believe,
certainly
unintentionally
left
the
impression
that
the
requirement
of
presence
in
the
united
states
was
imposed
on
mr.
bellei
after
a
conferral
of
american
citizenship
on
him
at
birth.
that
is
not
quite
accurate.
he
received
his
american
citizenship
pursuant
to
section
1993
of
the
revised
statutes
as
amended
in
1934
and
that's
as
the
statute
set
forth
in
page
44
of
our
brief,
and
it
does
provide
for
a
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states.
indeed
a
more
onerous
period
of
residence
in
united
states
in
present
law
under
which
mr.
bellei's
situation
was
tested
because
it
must
be
accomplished
by
the
age
of
13
i
believe.
now,
mr.
rogge
also
misinterprets
the
government's
position,
if
i
may
say,
on
the
moral
word,
if
you
will,
that
he
children
who
were
born
overseas
and
who
are
subject
to
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
we
make
no
claim
that
these
children
cannot
be
good
americans,
but
we
think
that
there
is
something
much
more
to
performing
the
duties
of
an
american
citizenship
from
watching
american
movies
and
american
television
overseas,
and
eating
hotdogs
and
bubble
gums.
and
what
congress
was
looking
for
and
what
congress
had
provided
for
by
the
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states
was
the
assurance
that
these
children,
these
young
adults,
wherever
they
reside
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
they
could
go
back
overseas
and
have
no
restrictions
on
them
or
whatsoever,
would
be
persons
who
had
some
meaningful
relationship
to
the
united
states,
some
ability,
some
personal
understanding
of
how
the
institutions
and
people
of
the
united
states
operate.
and
some
ability
if
necessary
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
those
institutions,
a
personal
stake,
in
other
words
in
the
institutions
and
people
of
the
united
states.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
the
very
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
is
that
mr.
rogge
invoked
considerations
of
a
shrinking
world,
expanding
notions
of
nationality,
but
these
notions
were
encountered
due
to
a
developing
trade
and
international
law,
which
i'm
not
entirely
familiar,
but
i've
done
some
research
on,
which
shows
that
because
of
the
problem
of
duo
nationality,
international
lawyers
are
struggling
with
the
concept
similar
to
that
in
our
domestic
conflict
of
laws
of
effective
nationality
as
recognizing
the
persons
may
have
citizenship
in
a
number
of
states
or
usually
two
countries.
where
the
rights
of
the
citizens
are
to
be
asserted,
the
test
is
where
the
real
and
effective
citizenship
of
the
individual
is
and
one
exercise
in
this
development
is
the
article
of
the
convention
of
the
conflict
of
nationality
laws
in
1930
which
i
will
not
take
time
to
read.
another
example
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
international
justice,
in
the
natobong
case
in
1955.
for
those
reasons
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
calls
into
question
the
constitutionality
on
an
act
of
congress.
the
statute
involved
as
part
of
section
301
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
this
statute
is
set
forth
on
page
45
and
46
of
our
brief.
section
301
(a)
(7)
includes
among
those
who
are
declared
to
be
citizens
of
united
states
at
birth.
persons
who
are
born
abroad
of
one
alien
parent
and
of
one
citizen
parent
who
has
resided
for
a
specified
time
in
the
united
states.
section
301
(b)
provides
that
such
persons
that
is
person
foreign
born
persons
who
derive
their
american
citizenship
from
one
american
parent,
must
come
to
the
united
states
prior
to
their
23rd
birthday
and
remain
here
continuously
for
five
years,
prior
to
reaching
age
28
in
order
to
retain
their
american
citizenship.
another
section
of
the
code
provides
that
absences
from
the
united
states
of
less
than
12
months
in
the
aggregate
will
not
break
the
required
continuity
of
the
physical
presence
in
the
united
states.
the
facts
in
this
case
were
stipulated
and
can
be
stated
quite
briefly.
the
appellee,
aldo
mario
bellei
was
born
in
italy
in
december
1939.
his
father
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
italy,
although
bellei
became
an
italian
citizen
at
birth
and
is
an
italian
citizen
today.
he
also
acquired
american
citizenship
at
birth
under
the
predecessor
of
section
301
(a)
(7),
because
his
mother
had
been
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states
and
was
an
american
citizen.
appellee
resided
in
italy
from
the
time
of
his
birth
until
recently,
when
he
moved
from
italy
to
england.
prior
to
his
23rd
birthday,
he
made
four
brief
visits
to
united
states,
the
longest
of
these
being
four
months
in
duration.
on
several
occasions,
when
he
applied
for
renewals
of
his
united
states
passport,
he
was
advised
by
american
consul
officials
that
he
must
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
period
of
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states.
when
the
appellee
did
not
heed
these
warnings
and
remained
in
italy
past
his
24th
birthday,
his
passport
was
canceled
on
the
ground
that
he
was
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
thereafter,
the
appellee
instituted
this
suit
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
premised
on
the
contention
of
section
301
(b)
is
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
district
court
sustained
the
appellee's
claim
to
american
citizenship,
holding
section
301
(b)
unconstitutional
on
the
authority
of
this
court's
decisions
in
schneider
versus
rusk
and
afroyim
versus
rusk.
the
government
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
we
argue
in
this
case
that
the
type
of
citizenship
involved
here
is
of
an
entirely
different
type
than
that
involved
in
schneider
and
afroyim,
that
it
owes
it's
existence
entirely
to
legislative
judgment
and
that
the
provision
for
it's
termination
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
same
authority
by
which
appellee
citizenship
was
created.
we
contend
further
that
a
decision
sustaining
this
statute
would
not
undermine
the
principles
on
which
this
court's
previous
decisions
rested.
we
build
our
argument
on
the
following
points.
first,
there
is
no
claim
that
section
301
(b)
is
a
penal
law,
either
in
its
intent
or
in
its
effect.
residents
abroad
is
not
a
criminal
or
reprehensible
act
declared
by
the
american
government
or
by
the
american
people.
the
loss
of
citizenship
is
in
no
way
intended
to
punish
such
absence
from
the
united
states.
therefore,
the
principals
which
underlay
this
court's
decision
in
mendoza
martinez
are
not
applicable
here.
second,
the
laws
of
nationality
under
section--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
our
case
would
be
much
more
difficult,
i
would
not
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
we
could
make
a
contention
that
absence
abroad
of
extremely
long
duration
may
indicate
of
voluntary
relinquishment
of
american
citizenship.
but
then
we
would
be
struck
with
a
counter
argument,
premised
on
schneider
that
we
would
be
distinguishing
between
this
class
of
american
--
unreasonably
distinguishing
between
this
class
of
american
citizens
and
other
citizens
who
require
their
citizenship
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
that
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
and
we're
contending
quite
forcefully
in
this
case
that
voluntary
relinquishment
is
not
necessarily
the
standard
because
of
the
like
fourteenth
amendment
foundation.
our
second
point
is
that
the
laws
of
nationality
under
section
301
unlike
the
statute
involved
in
trote
versus
dallas,
does
not
create
the
risk
of
statelessness,
which
concerned
chief
justice
warren
in
that
case.
the
legislative
history
set
out
in
our
brief
shows
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
dual
nationality
and
the
protection
of
persons
abroad
who
held
american
citizenship
for
owing
primary
and
permanent
allegiance
to
another
country.
to
such
persons,
the
laws
of
american
citizenship
does
not
result
in
statelessness.
they
simply
retain
the
citizenship
of
the
country
to
which
they
have
shown
their
principal
attachment.
in
this
case,
the
appellee
is,
and
always
has
been,
a
citizen
of
italy.
our
third
point,
and
this
is
a
critical
point
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
court's
recent
precedence
in
the
area
is
that
the
type
of
citizenship
involved
here
does
not
derive
any
constitutional
protection
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
afroyim
versus
rusk,
found
in
first
section
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
protection
against
involuntary
expatriation
for
those
persons
whose
citizenship
was
declared
by
that
sentence.
the
process
by
which
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
held
to
include
certain
substantive
guarantees
and
the
type
and
scope
of
these
guarantees
are
matters
which
i
confess
are
not
entirely
clear
to
me.
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
whatever
those
rights
may
be,
they
are
in
guaranteed
only
to
those
persons
whose
citizenship
is
declared
by
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
reads,
“all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
other
state
wherein
they
reside.”
the
appellee
of
course
was
not
born
in
the
united
states.
there
may
be
some
questions
whether
he
acquired
his
citizenship
by
naturalization
although
it
is
not
pressed
that
contention.
we
doubt
whether
section
301
(a)
(7)
can
be
considered
in
naturalization
statute
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
can
find
no
authority
that
the
reconstruction
congress
view
the
statutory
acquisition
of
citizenship
at
birth
as
part
of
the
naturalization
process.
but
even
of
it
is
assumed
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
that
is
not
entirely
clear.
the
court
below
passed
over
the
point
in
its
opinion
and
in
our
brief
we
agreed
that
there
was
constitutional
authority
to
grant
this
type
of
citizenship.
we
suggest
that
that
have
might
be
premised
on
the
naturalization
clause
and
it
might
be
premised
upon
the
congress'
inherent
powers,
the
legislative
body
of
a
sovereign
to
declare
the
classes
of
persons
who
will
be
considered
as
citizens.
my
own
research
in
the
area
leads
me
to
conclude
that
the
creation
of
this
class
of
citizenship
is
in
the
exercise
of
an
inherent
power
rather
than
the--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
perhaps
could.
the
basis
for
my
conclusion
is
that
the
congress
--
according
to
the
english
precedent
where
the
use
solely
was
the
fundamental
law
of
citizenship,
but
as
i'll
show
later,
was
amended
by
the
parliament
in
1350
to
provide
for
a
limited
grant
of
citizenship
to
children
born
of
british
nationals
overseas.
that
the
english
authorities
viewed
that
as
of
the
same
order
of
creation
of
citizenship
as
the
natural
law
of
use
solely,
and
that
it
wasn't
considered
to
be
part
of
the
naturalization
process
which
proceeded
separately
by
separate
statutes.
i
believe
that
that
was
the
approach
which
the
founding
fathers
had
in
the
constitution
that
is
to
the
extent
that
this
power
is
existing
in
congress,
it
exists
as
a
natural
incident
of
the
sovereignty
and
there
is
very
limited
authority
to
cite
for
that.
the
very
first
statute
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
think
so,
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
his
citizenship
would
not
be
derived.
it
would
gain
no
protection
from
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it
does
follow
from
that,
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
take
care
of
a
particular
problem
in
the
united
states
at
that
time
in
securing
of
the
right
of
citizenship
to
the
newly
freed
slaves
and
it
since
had
been
interpreted
more
broadly
to
have
rights
involving
rights
associated
with
the
preservation
of
citizenship.
but
insofar
as
the
citizenship
is
to
be
created
by
the
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
define
citizens
of
the
united
states,
then
it
must
be
admitted
that
that
power
has
--
that
included
within
that
power
is
the
authority
to
impose
reasonable
conditions
upon
that
citizenship.
that
power
in
afroyim
holds,
perhaps
was
taken
away
in
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
citizens
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
insofar
as
our
constitutional
principles
are
concerned,
we
argue
that
where
the
citizenship
is
created
entirely
by
statute
and
in
exercise
of
congressional
judgment,
that
reasonable
conditions
may
be
imposed.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
we
don't
make
that
argument.
we
do
not
argue
that
congress
lacks
the
authority
to
make
adverse
citizens
of
the
united
states,
those
who
were
born
abroad.
mr.
justice
brennan,
just
to
complete
my
answer
to
your
question,
some
limited
authority
for
my
proposition
comes
from
the
very
first
law
containing
this
provision
providing
for
grant
of
citizenship
to
children
born
abroad.
in
that
law,
which
was
passed
by
the
first
congress
in
1790,
it
says
that,
“and
the
children
of
citizens
of
the
united
states,
that
maybe
born
beyond
sea
or
out
of
the
limits
of
the
united
states,
shall
be
considered
as
natural
born
citizens.”
we
suggest
there
was
in
the
exercise
of
its
naturalization
authority
under
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i'm
not
aware
of
any
mr.
justice.
we
take
the
position
that
even
if
it
is
assumed,
that
the
appellee
acquired
his
citizenship
by
naturalization,
it
still
would
not
come
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
so
because
he
was
neither
naturalized
in
the
unites
states
nor
was
he
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
when
he
acquired
his
citizenship.
the
history
of
the
amendment
confirms
when
its
language
unmistakably
contemplates
that
it
was
directed
to
events
occurring
in
the
united
states.
this
was
well
settled
by
what
mr.
justice
douglas
has
called,
the
historic
decision
in
the
united
states
versus
wong
kim
ark
and
i
would
like
to
quote
certain
passages
from
the
opinion,
this
is
169
u.s.,
at
687.
“and
from
1795,
the
provision
of
those
acts
which
granted
citizenship
to
foreign
born
children
of
american
parents,
describes
such
children
as
born
out
of
the
limits
and
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
thus
congress,
when
dealing
with
the
question
of
citizenship
in
that
aspect,
treated
aliens
residing
in
this
country
as
“under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states”
an
american
parents
residing
abroad
as
“out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
passing
onto
page
688,
this
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
declaratory
of
existing
rights,
it's
the
first
sentence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
affirmative
of
existing
law,
as
to
each
of
the
qualifications
therein
expressed,
born
in
the
united
states,
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof.
in
short,
as
to
everything
relating
to
the
acquisition
of
citizenship,
by
facts
occurring
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states,
but
it
has
not
touched
the
acquisition
of
citizenship
by
being
born
abroad
of
american
parents
and
has
left
that
subject
to
be
regulated
as
it
had
always
been
by
congress.
in
the
exercise
of
the
power,
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
establish
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization,
so
there
is
contrary
suggestion
by
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
is
support
for
the
other
proposition.
i
expressed
earlier
as
my
own
conclusion.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
it
is
not
exclusive
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
except
for
the
naturalization.
the
citation
from
wong
kim
ark
leads
to
our
fourth
point.
that
lacking
any
constitutional
protection,
the
citizenship
which
appellee
enjoyed
is
dependent
entirely
for
its
existence
and
its
rights
on
congressional
enactments.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
on
congressional
enactments.
this
was
established
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
by
mr.
horace
benny,
in
his
study
which
is
thrice
been
cited
by
this
court
with
approval,
it
appears
in
2
american
law
register.
at
common
law,
the
foreign-born
child
of
english
citizens
did
not
inherit
the
right
of
english
citizenship
and
such
a
child
was
treated
as
an
alien
in
england.
the
first
statute
to
remedy
this
was
passed
in
1350,
the
25th
year
of
the
reign
of
edward
iii.
that
statute
which
granted
citizenship
at
birth
to
a
child
born
abroad
of
two
english
parents,
and
subsequent
statutes
on
the
same
subject
were
construed
strictly
by
the
english
courts.
this
court's
decision
is
montana
versus
kennedy,
decided
nine
years
ago,
puts
to
rest
any
notions
that
the
rights
of
children
born
abroad
to
american
parents
are
greater
than
what
congress
has
provided
in
its
citizenship
laws.
the
petitioner
in
that
case
was
born
in
italy
to
an
italian
father
and
an
american
mother
in
1906,
when
the
law
provided
for
citizenship
by
inheritance
only
from
american
fathers.
shortly
after
his
birth,
he
was
brought
to
the
united
states
where
he
resided
continuously
for
50
years
without
ever
been
naturalized.
when
the
government
sought
to
deport
him
as
an
alien,
be
brought
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
of
the
citizenship.
eight
justices
of
this
court
held
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
of
theunited
states
because
he
did
not
come
literally
within
the
grant
of
citizenship
in
the
statute.
surely,
a
federal
common
law
where
the
constitution
afforded
any
rights
of
citizenship
to
the
foreign
born,
they
would
have
been
exercised
in
favor
of
this
man
who
had
resided
in
this
country
for
more
than
50
years.
on
the
basis
of
the
foregoing
points,
the
primary
question
presented
in
our
view
is
whether
the
congress
in
the
exercise
of
this
power
to
grant
citizenship
to
the
foreign
born
children
of
american
citizens,
they
condition
that
grant
on
the
child's
coming
to
live
in
the
united
states
for
a
certain
period.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
voluntary
relinquishment
mr.
justice
in
our
view
is
inapplicable
here.
that
is
not
a
test
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
correct.
the
legislative
history
of
the
requirement
of
five
years
continuous
presence
in
the
united
states
shows
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
unsatisfactory
status
of
persons
abroad,
having
both
american
citizenship
and
citizenship
in
another
country.
this
was
and
it
is
today
a
legitimate
concern.
the
presence
of
american
citizens
abroad
imposes
on
our
government
a
duty
to
assure
proper
treatment
of
their
persons
and
property.
the
carrying
out
of
this
duty
inevitably
results
in
international
conflicts
with
the
other
nation
which
also
regards
the
individual
as
its
citizens.
an
examination
of
any
of
the
several
textbooks
on
nationality
will
reveal
that
there
are
many
types
of
conflicts
which
may
develop
on
matters
such
as
reparations,
protests,
and
claims
for
lawsuits,
and
it
also
would
reveal
that
the
fact
that
the
law
has
not
settled
on
the
resolution
of
many
of
these
conflicts.
these
conflicts
are
to
bar
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
serious
problems,
inevitably
implicating
nationality.
to
continue
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
mendoza
martinez,
“we
have
recognized
the
entanglements
which
may
stem
from
dual
allegiance,
and
have
twice
sustained
statutes
which
provide
for
the
loss
of
american
citizenship
upon
the
deliberate
assumption
of
a
foreign
attachment.”
the
congress
recognized
that
an
unconditional
granting
of
american
citizenship
solely
because
that
one
of
the
individual's
parents
was
an
american
citizen,
meant
that
our
government
would
risk
involvement
in
such
international
disputes
on
behalf
of
persons
who
had
no
attachment
or
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
this
much,
the
court
below
also
recognized.
it
said,
“there
is
an
undeniable
danger
that
children
born
and
raised
abroad,
in
a
foreign
home
where
english
may
never
be
spoken,
school
where
english
is
not
thought,
celebrating
foreign
holidays
with
the
family
of
the
non-american
parent,
will
have
no
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states,
its
culture
or
heritage.
it
is
a
legitimate
concern
of
congress
that
those
who
bear
american
citizenship
and
receive
its
benefits
have
some
nexus
to
the
united
states.”
plus,
the
congress
decided
that
in
continuing
the
grant
of
american
citizenship,
to
foreign
born
persons
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply,
it
was
desirable
to
reduce
the
risk
that
there
would
be
class
of
citizens
living
permanently
abroad
having
no
attachment
to
the
united
states.
it
sought
to
achieve
this
goal
as
it
had
done
under
the
naturalization
laws
by
requiring
a
period
of
residence
in
this
country.
in
light
of
the
considerations
which
prompted
in,
we
think
that
this
requirement
is
entirely
reasonable.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
believe
it
is
five
years,
for
naturalization.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
something
along
that
line.
it
says
that
the
same
considerations
which
prompted
congress
to
require
a
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states
for
aliens,
to
make
sure
that
they
have
some
association
with
life
in
the
unites
states,
are
the
same
considerations
which
prompted
the
congress
to
enact
this
particular
requirement
and
in
this
case,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
presence
of
such
people
abroad
imposes
versions
of
the
united
states
in
it's
diplomatic
representations.
the
final
question
then
is
whether
congress
may
constitutionally,
make
a
residence
requirement,
a
condition
of
the
continuation
of
this
statutory
citizenship
rather
than
the
acquisition
of
the
citizenship.
the
congress
of
course
could
have
provided
that
children
born
abroad
of
one
american
parent
shall
become
citizens
after
a
period
of
residence
in
this
country.
but
this
would
have
had
unfortunate
consequences
during
the
child's
minority
when
the
american
parent
could
not
be
rely
on
american
diplomatic
protection
for
his
or
her
child.
it
also
would
have
created
novel
problems
of
status
and
rights
when
the
child
returned
to
this
country
in
order
to
fulfill
his
residence
requirement.
so
the
congress
would
like
to
declare
the
minor
child
as
citizen,
but
to
condition
the
grant
of
lifetime
citizenship,
when
the
child's
coming
to
the
united
states
and
residing
here
for
a
period
of
time.
this
too
we
think
was
a
reasonable
decision
by
the
congress.
it
did
not
violate
the
due
process
rights
of
the
appellee
and
others
affected
by
the
statute.
appellee
had
american
diplomatic
protection
during
his
minority
when
he
was
dependent
on
his
parents.
there
was
no
contention
that
he
suffered
any
disability
or
any
prejudice
by
reason
of
being
an
american
citizen
during
his
minority.
when
he
came
of
age,
the
congress
in
effect
asked
him
the
question
that
it
properly
could
ask
in
granting
citizenship
to
such
persons.
is
your
sole
allegiance
to
the
united
states
or
is
your
allegiance
to
italy
where
you
were
born
and
raised,
where
you
went
to
school,
where
you
worked
and
married?
the
congress
asked
only
that
he
come
to
this
country
and
be
part
of
it's
life
for
five
years.
there
is
no
reason
apparent
for
the
appellee's
failure
to
do
so
other
than
that
he
was
too
deeply
involved
in
activities
in
his
homeland.
for
us,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
he
should
be
able
to
command
united
states
citizenship
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
may
i
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
gordon
advices
that
the
statute
is
applicable
to
the
child
of
an
american
service
men
or
women
overseas,
married
to
an
alien?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
there
are
those
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
those
situations
provide
no
difficulty
under
this
statute
because
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
marriage
and
the
development
of
the
child,
serviceman
is
rotated
back
to
the
united
states,
there's
usually
no
intention
in
those
cases
to
relinquish
american
residency
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
that's
entirely
possible
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
they
return
back
to
the
united
states,
the
child
is
born
and
raised
in
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
sir.
mr.
rogge
i
believe,
certainly
unintentionally
left
the
impression
that
the
requirement
of
presence
in
the
united
states
was
imposed
on
mr.
bellei
after
a
conferral
of
american
citizenship
on
him
at
birth.
that
is
not
quite
accurate.
he
received
his
american
citizenship
pursuant
to
section
1993
of
the
revised
statutes
as
amended
in
1934
and
that's
as
the
statute
set
forth
in
page
44
of
our
brief,
and
it
does
provide
for
a
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states.
indeed
a
more
onerous
period
of
residence
in
united
states
in
present
law
under
which
mr.
bellei's
situation
was
tested
because
it
must
be
accomplished
by
the
age
of
13
i
believe.
now,
mr.
rogge
also
misinterprets
the
government's
position,
if
i
may
say,
on
the
moral
word,
if
you
will,
that
he
children
who
were
born
overseas
and
who
are
subject
to
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
we
make
no
claim
that
these
children
cannot
be
good
americans,
but
we
think
that
there
is
something
much
more
to
performing
the
duties
of
an
american
citizenship
from
watching
american
movies
and
american
television
overseas,
and
eating
hotdogs
and
bubble
gums.
and
what
congress
was
looking
for
and
what
congress
had
provided
for
by
the
period
of
residence
in
the
united
states
was
the
assurance
that
these
children,
these
young
adults,
wherever
they
reside
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
they
could
go
back
overseas
and
have
no
restrictions
on
them
or
whatsoever,
would
be
persons
who
had
some
meaningful
relationship
to
the
united
states,
some
ability,
some
personal
understanding
of
how
the
institutions
and
people
of
the
united
states
operate.
and
some
ability
if
necessary
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
those
institutions,
a
personal
stake,
in
other
words
in
the
institutions
and
people
of
the
united
states.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
the
very
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
is
that
mr.
rogge
invoked
considerations
of
a
shrinking
world,
expanding
notions
of
nationality,
but
these
notions
were
encountered
due
to
a
developing
trade
and
international
law,
which
i'm
not
entirely
familiar,
but
i've
done
some
research
on,
which
shows
that
because
of
the
problem
of
duo
nationality,
international
lawyers
are
struggling
with
the
concept
similar
to
that
in
our
domestic
conflict
of
laws
of
effective
nationality
as
recognizing
the
persons
may
have
citizenship
in
a
number
of
states
or
usually
two
countries.
where
the
rights
of
the
citizens
are
to
be
asserted,
the
test
is
where
the
real
and
effective
citizenship
of
the
individual
is
and
one
exercise
in
this
development
is
the
article
of
the
convention
of
the
conflict
of
nationality
laws
in
1930
which
i
will
not
take
time
to
read.
another
example
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
international
justice,
in
the
natobong
case
in
1955.
for
those
reasons
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
