mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case
brought
here
by
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
utah.
i
might
say
the
outset
that
the
united
states
brought
the
case
here
not
because
of
the
intrinsic
importance
of
the
case
much
less
for
the
revenue
involved
but
rather
out
of
concern
for
the
--
what
seems
to
us
only
fairly
characterized
this
judicial
arbitrariness
in
this
matter.
having
said
that
i
want
to
be
very
careful
and
detailed
in
stating
the
facts
of
the
case.
as
i
said,
we're
in
the
district
of
utah
before
the
chief
judge,
judge
ritter.
information
is
filed
against
a
man
who's
charged
with
having
prepared
income
tax
returns
for
others
and
having
done
so
in
a
way
so
as
to
make
those
returns
false
and
fraudulent.
specifically,
he
invented
or
grossly
exaggerated
deductions
to
which
the
taxpayers
were
not
entitled.
the
case
was
called
for
trial
on
a
certain
day
in
august
1968
at
which
time
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn,
this
was
in
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon,
the
united
states
attorney
indicated
that
he
wished
to
amend
the
25-count
information,
reduce
it
down
to
11
counts.
at
that
point,
the
judge
ritter
indicated
that
if
there
was
some
doubt
about
need
for
bringing
what
he
called
a
two-bit
case,
perhaps
the
government
wanted
more
time
to
have
some
more
time
with
result
in
the
dismissal
of
the
remaining
counts.
i
find
out
that
this
itself
would
have
resulted
in
a
mistrial.
the
jury
had
and
already
been
sworn
if
the
government
had
been
allowed
more
time
in
which
to
consider
whether
it
wish
to
dismiss
this
information.
the
government
indicated
that
it
was
ready,
the
defense
had
no
suggestion
to
make
understandably
and
so
the
case
proceeded.
the
first
witness
was
an
internal
revenue
official
who
was
called
simply
to
identify
the
returns
which
were
the
subject
of
the
charge.
it
was
immediately
stipulated
that
these
were
authentic
returns
and
the
witness
therefore
all
was
immediately
removed
from
the
stand.
thereupon,
the
first
real
witness
was
called
by
the
prosecution
who
was
one
of
the
taxpayers,
that
is
one
of
those
for
whom
a
return
had
been
prepared
by
the
defendant
mr.
jorn.
as
soon
as
the
taxpayer
took
the
stand,
defense
counsel,
and
this
appears
at
page
40
of
the
very
short
record
in
this
case.
mr.
morrill,
defense
counsel
addresses
the
court
as
follows,
“in
view
of
the
transcript
in
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
matter,
it
is
my
feeling
that
each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying
because
i
feel
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
violation
of
the
law.”
the
judge
responded,
“well
we
wouldn't
want
anybody
to
talk
himself
into
a
federal
penitentiary
here,
so
what
the
court
has
to
say
to
you
is
this.”
and
i
would
not
read
the
following
two
pages
in
which
the
judge
quite
clearly,
emphatically,
in
the
strongest
possible
terms,
advices
the
prospective
witnesses
of
their
right
not
to
testify
for
fear
of
incriminating
themselves
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer,
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
them
even
though
they
are
not
criminal
defendants
before
they
testify
and
then
he
addresses
the
witness
and
says,
this
in
now
on
page
41,
“well
what
do
you
want
to
do?”
the
witness
responds,
“your
honor,
my
wife
and
i
have
had
it
pointed
out
to
us
that
our
returns
have
information
in
them
that
we
know
is
wrong
and
we
have
admitted
this
and
i
would
admit
it
further
in
this
court.
the
judge
responds,
“have
you
talked
to
a
lawyer?”
witness
says,
“no
sir.”
the
court
says,
“i
am
not
going
to
let
you
admitted
any
further
in
this
court,
that
is
all
there
is
about
that.
the
admissions
you've
already
made
were
very
likely
obtained
from
you
without
telling
you
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.”
the
witness
says,
“no
sir.”
the
court
says,
“what
is
that?”
the
witness
says,
“we
were
advised
at
the
time
we
were
first
contacted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.”
the
judge
responds,
“if
you
were,
you
are
the
only
taxpayer
in
the
united
states
that
has
been
so
advised
because
they
do
not
do
that
when
they
first
contact
you.”
and
the
judge
then
explains
his
version
of
how
a
revenue
service
goes
about
incriminating
prospective
defense.
the
judge
addresses
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
mr.
chief
justice,
there
had
been
a
separation
of
witnesses
the
other
of
respective
taxpayers
had
been
excluded.
they
later
were
returned
to
the
courtroom
and
addressed
by
the
judge
with
respect
to
their
rights
also
but
by
that
time
the
judge
had
already
indicated
his
disposition
to
avoid
the
trial.
the
judge
excuses
the
witness
at
this
point,
turns
to
the
us
attorney
and
says
“are
all
your
witnesses
in
this
shape?”
the
us
attorney
replies,
“your
honor,
by
the
time
any
of
these
witnesses
were
contacted,
there
was
a
criminal
investigation,
not
of
the
witnesses
but
of
the
defendant.
it
is
true
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
require
this
warning
until
after
first
meeting
with
a
special
agent.
but
it
is
the
practice
in
this
office,
they
do
give
this
warning,
it
is
not
required
but
they
do.”
the
judge
then
expresses
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
warning
could
have
been
sufficient.
there
is
more
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
united
states
attorney.
we're
now
on
page
43.
the
judge
once
again
expresses
his
view
that
this
case
never
should
have
been
brought
because
of
the
trivial
amounts
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were
originally
mr.
justice
black
25
counts
showing
exaggerated
or
invented
deductions
in
amounts
ranging
from,
i
think,
for
each
taxpayer,
totals
somewhere
between
two
and
three,
or
$400.
eventually,
14
of
those
counts
were
removed
but
for
all
we
know
mr.
jorn
had
been
involved
in
this
occupation
for
some
time
and
was
expectedly
to
have
much
larger
number
of
taxpayers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
appears
from
colloquy
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
between
the
judge,
and
i
think,
defense
counsel
that
mr.
jorn
was
not
a
professional
accountant.
that
he
at
this
point
was
no
longer
in
this
tax
service
but
that
he
had
some
accounting
training
and
judging
from
this
particular
information
which
recites
several
tax
years
with
respect
to
each
of
the
taxpayers,
he
had
been
engaged
in
it
at
least
for
three
years
because
we
have
three
different
years
for
several
of
the
taxpayers.
we
just
don't
know
how
large
an
operation
it
was,
it
does
appear
that
the
taxpayers
involved
were
of
modest
income.
on
page
43
of
the
record,
the
court
finally
ends
the
colloquies
with
the
statement.
well,
i
will
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
in
this
case.
ladies
and
gentlemen,
it
won't
be
necessary
for
you
to
attend
the
court
any
further
on
this
matter
at
this
point,
with
this
charges
jury.
the
judge
then
requires
all
the
taxpayers
including
the
witnesses
who
had
been
excluded
under
the
rule
to
return
to
the
courtroom.
we're
now
on
page
44
of
the
record
and
he
once
again
and
for
the
better
part
of
three
pages
advises
them
with
respect
to
their
right
to
remain
silent,
their
right
not
to
testify,
his
decision
not
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
until
such
time
that
he
personally
has
had
a
further
opportunity
to
suggest
to
them
the
unwisdom
of
putting
themselves
in
danger
of
self-incrimination.
and
finally
the
judge
says,
“so,
this
case
is
vacated,
setting
is
vacated
this
afternoon
and
it
will
be
calendared
again.
and
before
it
is
calendared
again
i
am
going
to
have
this
witnesses
in
and
talk
to
them
before,
i
will
talk
to
them
again
before
i
will
permit
them
to
testify.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
wedsol
is
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
serving
a
case
for
the
government.
on
basis
of
the
facts
i've
just
recited,
it
seems
to
our
certain
propositions
of
not
subject
to
controversy.
the
first
is,
that
the
government
here,
the
united
states
attorney
was
in
no
way
at
fault,
no
way
guilty
of
misconduct,
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
ending,
premature
ending
of
this
trial
or
for
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
it
is
also
true
that
no
conduct
of
defense
made
this
course
inevitable.
however,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
statement
of
facts,
it
was
at
the
instance
of
defense
counsel
that
the
judge
proceeded
to
interrogate
the
witnesses
and
ultimately
to
declare
a
mistrial.
it
was
the
suggestion
of
defense
counsel
that
provoked
the
ultimate
action
declaring
a
mistrial.
now,
it
maybe
that
defense
counsel
had
in
mind
simply
that
the
judge
would
admonish
the
taxpayers
with
respect
to
their
rights.
no
doubt,
defense
counsel
hoped
that
such
advise
from
the
judge
might
change
the
minds
of
some
of
the
witnesses
with
respect
to
their
willingness
to
testify
or
their
decision
thus,
for
not
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
or
it
may
be
that
defense
counsel
anticipated
what
in
fact
did
happen.
we're
in
no
position
to
guess
about
that.
in
so
far
as
the
mistrial
is
the
consequence
of
a
defense
motion,
the
case
is
so
clearly
governed
by
prior
cases
of
this
court
that
i
need
not
dwell
on
that
aspect
of
it.
i
am
willing
to
argue
however
on
the
alternative
basis
that
the
defense
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
the
judge's
arbitrary
action
in
prematurely
ending
the
trial.
and
on
for
that
purpose
it
seems
to
us
we
can
assimilate
this
case
in
every
respect
with
gori
versus
united
states
cited
by
this
court
some
few
terms
ago.
they
also
adjudged
in
what
this
could
characterized
as
exaggerated
or
perhaps
exaggerated
solicitude
for
the
defendant
without
any
motion
from
the
defense
ordered
a
mistrial
and
the
question
was
whether
the
defendant
could
be
retried
subsequently.
the
court
held
that
he
could.
that
decision
as
well
as,
or
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
‘70
have
indicated
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
really
does
not
control
this
question
in
any
direct
sense.
double
jeopardy
clause
is
directly,
and
as
this
court
has
construed
it,
deals
more
immediately
with
the
problem
of
a
case
which
has
gone
to
verdict,
whether
a
verdict
of
acquittal
or
a
verdict
of
conviction.
a
mistrial,
which
is
of
course
neither
barred
re-prosecution
only
in
circumstances
where
either
and
i
think
this
is,
this
court's
decision
in
downum
where
to
allow
a
retrial
would
be
to
get
around
the
double
jeopardy
ball.
in
this
sense,
if
the
defendant
stood
a
good
chance
of
winning
an
acquittal
which
would
have
barred
his
retrial.
he
must
not
be
cheated
of
that
right
to
obtain
an
acquittal
by
action,
unjustified
action
made
at
the
door
of
the
prosecution
because
the
government
thinks
its
case
is
going
badly
and
in
that
sense,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
be
put
in
terms
of
fundamental
fairness
or
fundamental
unfairness.
we
put
it
in
terms
of
whether
the
action
of
the
court
was
taken
on
behalf
of
the
government,
whether
its
affect
was
to
harass
the
defense.
we
recognize
that
it
may
be
a
part
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
though
aside
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
have
a
case
brought
to
a
conclusion
before
the
jury
first
in
panel
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
right.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
precisely
that
example,
an
example
which
indicates
not
a
motion
of
the
defendant,
not
a
waiver
by
the
defendant
indicates
that
there
is
no
absolute
bar.
mr.
justice
washington
very
early
on
said,
double
jeopardy
clause
obviously
doesn't
control
this
situation
of
a
mistrial
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
no
exceptions
in
it
and
we
had
no
right
to
read
exceptions
into
it.
therefore,
this
is
a
case
not
governed
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
since
everyone
concedes
that
in
the
case
of
a
hung
jury,
for
instance,
there
must
be
a
right
in
the
public
in
the
prosecution
to
retry
even
though
no
argument
of
waiver
by
the
defense
could
possibly
be
advanced.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
early
termination
of
this
trial
after
it
have
only
technically
began
has
a
bearing
on
the
extent
to
which
the
defendant
was
harassed
by,
or
would
be
harassed
by,
a
new
prosecution.
he
has
not
undergone,
he
has
not
gone
through
the
gauntlet
in
any
real
sense
at
the
point
when
this
trial
was
aborted.
and
since
this
is
a
matter
not
governed
by
absolute
rules,
whose
considerations
it
seems
to
us
ought
to
be
relevant.
i
may
say
that
at
this,
of
this
invokes
the
decision
of
this
court
in
tateo
versus
united
states.
it
seems
to
us
also
relevant
that
in
the
case
of
a
trial
which
does
go
to
a
conclusion
but
which
is
reversed
on
appeal,
reversed
on
appeal
often
for
grounds
which
amount
to
characterizing
the
first
trial
as
a
mistrial,
an
erroneous
trial.
a
trial
in
many
instances
where
the
judge
should
have
halted
it
before
it
went
today.
that
situation
and
this
one
ought
not
be
so
radically
distinguished
and
yet
in
every
case
where
a
trial
which
is
reversed
on
appeal
allows
a
retrial
even
where
the
new
trial,
the
first
trial
was
reversed
for
lack
of
sufficient
evidence.
this
court
has
specifically
so
held.
and
why
the
result
should
be
so
different
because
the
judge
interposed
himself
early
rather
than
an
appellate
court
is
not
easy
to
appreciate.
the
difference
cannot
be
that
it
is
the
defendant
who
is
moving
for
a
new
trial
in
the
case
of
an
appeal
because
that
would
be
an
instance
in
which
a
defendant
was
required
in
order
to
observe
one
constitutional
right,
constitutional
right
to
reverse
so
long
for
constitutional
error
to
waive
a
supposed
other
constitutional
right,
the
right
not
to
be
retried,
that
is
the
right
created
in
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
follows
from
this
that
it
is
not
the
defendant's
motion
that
makes
a
new
trial
permissible
in
the
case
of
the
trial
which
is
not
the
verdict.
it
must
be
a
balancing
of
interest
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
deal
with
and
the
defendant's
motion
and
any
notion
of
waiver
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
rule
permitting
this.
for
these
several
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
below
ought
to
be
reversed
and
that
the
prosecution
be
free
to
proceed
with
a
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one,
one
comment
mr.
chief
justice.
i
agree
with
counsel
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
correctly
stated
in
the
quotation
you
made
attributed
to
a
member
of
this
court
that
the
issue
is
way
off
the
risk
of
judicial
arbitrariness
must
fall
in
these
circumstances.
that
statement
is
taken
from
the
descending
opinion
in
gory
versus
united
states.we
invoke
the
charity
opinion
in
that
same
case
which
has
never
been
repudiated
not
of
the
downum
decision
or
of
the
subsequent
decision
in
tateo
versus
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
doubts
of
considerations
here
requires
that
in
the
case
where
a
judge,
as
this
judge
you
must
conclude
has,
arbitrarily
and
without
the
need
for
doing
so,
declares
a
mistrial
but
not
at
the
instance
of
the
government,
not
for
the
advantage
of
the
government
that
the
provisions
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
do
not
prevent
retrial
of
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
court
will,
i
think,
shortly
perhaps
have
that
problem
not
quite
in
the
same
sense
of
a
mistrial.
the
case
of
a
judge
who
indicated
that
he
would
unless
restrained,
granted,
directed
verdict
or
acquittal
but
had
not
done
so
and
attempted
to
leave
the
government
free
to
follow
an
appeal.
i
suppose
that
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
here
or
if
the
judge
would
indicate
that
unless
restrained
by
the
appellate
court
he
intended
declared
a
mistrial.
in
the
meantime,
simply
granted
a
continuance
allowing
the
government
not
to
receive
a
mandamus
in
the
high
court,
nothing
would
prevent
the
high
court
from
entertaining
and
granting
such
a
writ.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
fong
foo,
i
think.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
had
thought
that
i
may
be
quite
wrong,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
was
done
after
the
judge
acting
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
intimation
that
he
was
going
to
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
question
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
issue
mandamus
when
the
judge
has
indicated
his
intention
but
has
not
yet
entered
the
order
is
a
difficult
one
which
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeal
did
entertain
and
did
grant
mandamus
against
judge
dooling
in
recent
instance
when
the
government
applied
to
that
court
at
what
amounted
to
judge
dooling's
suggestion
he
is
having
reckoned
an
opinion
indicating
his
intention
to
enter
an
order
of
acquittal
on
unless
the
appellate
court
would
otherwis
and
if
i
remembering
facts,
correctly
the
second
circuit
did
issue
mandamus
and
did
restrain
the
judge
from
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir.
i
think
--
i
think,
this
could
be
denied.
the
case
may
well
likely
recur
because
it
was
a
question
of
there
was
an
appeal
on
the
merits
subsequently.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
he
was
put
in
jeopardy.
the
question
whether
that
jeopardy
was
erased
by
the
occurrence
of
mistrial
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
that
seems
to
be
one
justification
for
the
notion
of
a
new
trial
say
after
a
hung
jury
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
initial
jeopardy
washes
out
in
the
absence
of
a
verdict.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
think
that
question
is
resolved
by
the
tateo
case
in
which
this
court
entertained
a
direct
appeal.
the
tateo
case,
tateo
versus
the
united
states,
not
a
mistrial
a
case
in
which
a
man
clearly
had
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
didn't
even
find
the
problem
which
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
construe
3731
as
meaning
in
jeopardy
on
the
trial
from
which
the
owner
is
sought
to
be,
from
which
the
appeal
is
sought
to
be
taken.
if
a
man
had
been
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
at
the
second
--
at
the
second
trial
he
was
not
in
jeopardy,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
before
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
government
filed
an
appeal
before
jeopardy
had
sit
in
on
the
second
trial.
if
a
man
had
been
convicted
30
years
before
and
plead
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
may
say
that
every
member
of
this
court
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
the
mersky
case,
where
this
court
divided
on
the
question
of
what
was
a
plea
involved,
your
honor
write
in
one
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart
writing
another.
the
stricter
view
taken
by
mr.
justice
stewart
gave
as
examples
of
the
kind
of
plea
involved
which
was
directly
appealable
to
this
court,
a
plea
which
set
up
the
claim
of
double
jeopardy.
that
is
the
classical
plea
involved.
if
that
were
not
appealable
then
no
case
under
the
plea
bar
section
of
3731
would
ever
reach
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that's
conceded
by
my
opponent.
however,
i
think
it
really
doesn't.
this
isn't
the
case
where
jurisdiction
turns
on
the
merits.
jurisdiction
as
this
court
noted
when
it
did
not
postpone
the
question
of
jurisdiction
exists
in
either
event
even
if
you
should
rule
against
the
government,
there
would
have
been
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeal
because
the
appeal,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
three
months
earlier
that
the
first
trial
occurred
30
years
earlier
of
three
weeks
earlier
this
is
a
wholly
separate
proceeding.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
some
previous
time
in
some
previous
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
so
we
think
this
court
has
in
effect
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
often
does
happen
that
sometime
after
the
trial
has
preceded
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
repeat
that,
first,
this
court
has
actually
entertained
an
appeal
in
such
as
a
case
in
tateo
where
the
man
had
been
on
trial
for
40
years.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
that
objection
had
been
made.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
if
the
objection
was
raised.
i'll
say
further
that
this
court
and
i
think
all
judges
had
recognized
the
classical
case
of
an
appealable
ruling
sustaining
a
motion
involved
is
a
ruling
to
the
effect
that
the
man
at
some
previous
time
had
been
in
jeopardy.
and
if
that
were
not
appealable,
then
they
would
not
be
in
a
strict
view
any
appealable
motion,
rulings
on
motions
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
it
could.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
the
way
downum
came
up
and
the
way
gori
came
up.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
if
it
is
not
appealable
to
this
court,
it
is
not
appealable
anywhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
sorry,
i
am
sorry
to
i
interrupted
you
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
mr.
justice
black
that
your
example
assumes
if
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
then
entered
by
the
jury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
did
the
verdict
of
acquittal
was
then
entered
by
the
jury
after
the
judge
had
excluded
the
evidence
of
these
witnesses?
of
course,
at
that
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
they
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
there
had
been
no
verdict
that
if
we
have
the
same
problem
we
have
here
if
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
acquittal
then
i
agree
that
there
could
have
been
no
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
jeopardy
would
have
attached
but
would
not,
there
is
a
sort
of
mystique,
the
jeopardy
attaches
from
the
swearing
of
the
first
juror
but
that
affect
may
not
carry
over
if
the
expected
conclusion
of
the
trial
that
is
a
verdict
does
not
take
place
and
that
must
be
the
rationale
for
a
hung
jury
which
does
allow
a
retrial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
am
clear,
mr.
justice
black
in
your
example,
what
it
is
that
prevented
a
verdict
from
being
returned,
but
that
is
the
critical
think
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
are
many
such
errors
of
things
which
the
government
has
no
recourse
and
as
i
say
if
that
error
had
resulted
in
the
verdict
of
acquittal,
that
would
have
been
an
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
then
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
strictly
speaking
there
must
be
a
verdict
or
acquittal
or
a
conviction.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case
brought
here
by
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
utah.
i
might
say
the
outset
that
the
united
states
brought
the
case
here
not
because
of
the
intrinsic
importance
of
the
case
much
less
for
the
revenue
involved
but
rather
out
of
concern
for
the
--
what
seems
to
us
only
fairly
characterized
this
judicial
arbitrariness
in
this
matter.
having
said
that
i
want
to
be
very
careful
and
detailed
in
stating
the
facts
of
the
case.
as
i
said,
we're
in
the
district
of
utah
before
the
chief
judge,
judge
ritter.
information
is
filed
against
a
man
who's
charged
with
having
prepared
income
tax
returns
for
others
and
having
done
so
in
a
way
so
as
to
make
those
returns
false
and
fraudulent.
specifically,
he
invented
or
grossly
exaggerated
deductions
to
which
the
taxpayers
were
not
entitled.
the
case
was
called
for
trial
on
a
certain
day
in
august
1968
at
which
time
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn,
this
was
in
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon,
the
united
states
attorney
indicated
that
he
wished
to
amend
the
25-count
information,
reduce
it
down
to
11
counts.
at
that
point,
the
judge
ritter
indicated
that
if
there
was
some
doubt
about
need
for
bringing
what
he
called
a
two-bit
case,
perhaps
the
government
wanted
more
time
to
have
some
more
time
with
result
in
the
dismissal
of
the
remaining
counts.
i
find
out
that
this
itself
would
have
resulted
in
a
mistrial.
the
jury
had
and
already
been
sworn
if
the
government
had
been
allowed
more
time
in
which
to
consider
whether
it
wish
to
dismiss
this
information.
the
government
indicated
that
it
was
ready,
the
defense
had
no
suggestion
to
make
understandably
and
so
the
case
proceeded.
the
first
witness
was
an
internal
revenue
official
who
was
called
simply
to
identify
the
returns
which
were
the
subject
of
the
charge.
it
was
immediately
stipulated
that
these
were
authentic
returns
and
the
witness
therefore
all
was
immediately
removed
from
the
stand.
thereupon,
the
first
real
witness
was
called
by
the
prosecution
who
was
one
of
the
taxpayers,
that
is
one
of
those
for
whom
a
return
had
been
prepared
by
the
defendant
mr.
jorn.
as
soon
as
the
taxpayer
took
the
stand,
defense
counsel,
and
this
appears
at
page
40
of
the
very
short
record
in
this
case.
mr.
morrill,
defense
counsel
addresses
the
court
as
follows,
“in
view
of
the
transcript
in
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
matter,
it
is
my
feeling
that
each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying
because
i
feel
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
violation
of
the
law.”
the
judge
responded,
“well
we
wouldn't
want
anybody
to
talk
himself
into
a
federal
penitentiary
here,
so
what
the
court
has
to
say
to
you
is
this.”
and
i
would
not
read
the
following
two
pages
in
which
the
judge
quite
clearly,
emphatically,
in
the
strongest
possible
terms,
advices
the
prospective
witnesses
of
their
right
not
to
testify
for
fear
of
incriminating
themselves
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer,
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
them
even
though
they
are
not
criminal
defendants
before
they
testify
and
then
he
addresses
the
witness
and
says,
this
in
now
on
page
41,
“well
what
do
you
want
to
do?”
the
witness
responds,
“your
honor,
my
wife
and
i
have
had
it
pointed
out
to
us
that
our
returns
have
information
in
them
that
we
know
is
wrong
and
we
have
admitted
this
and
i
would
admit
it
further
in
this
court.
the
judge
responds,
“have
you
talked
to
a
lawyer?”
witness
says,
“no
sir.”
the
court
says,
“i
am
not
going
to
let
you
admitted
any
further
in
this
court,
that
is
all
there
is
about
that.
the
admissions
you've
already
made
were
very
likely
obtained
from
you
without
telling
you
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.”
the
witness
says,
“no
sir.”
the
court
says,
“what
is
that?”
the
witness
says,
“we
were
advised
at
the
time
we
were
first
contacted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.”
the
judge
responds,
“if
you
were,
you
are
the
only
taxpayer
in
the
united
states
that
has
been
so
advised
because
they
do
not
do
that
when
they
first
contact
you.”
and
the
judge
then
explains
his
version
of
how
a
revenue
service
goes
about
incriminating
prospective
defense.
the
judge
addresses
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
mr.
chief
justice,
there
had
been
a
separation
of
witnesses
the
other
of
respective
taxpayers
had
been
excluded.
they
later
were
returned
to
the
courtroom
and
addressed
by
the
judge
with
respect
to
their
rights
also
but
by
that
time
the
judge
had
already
indicated
his
disposition
to
avoid
the
trial.
the
judge
excuses
the
witness
at
this
point,
turns
to
the
us
attorney
and
says
“are
all
your
witnesses
in
this
shape?”
the
us
attorney
replies,
“your
honor,
by
the
time
any
of
these
witnesses
were
contacted,
there
was
a
criminal
investigation,
not
of
the
witnesses
but
of
the
defendant.
it
is
true
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
require
this
warning
until
after
first
meeting
with
a
special
agent.
but
it
is
the
practice
in
this
office,
they
do
give
this
warning,
it
is
not
required
but
they
do.”
the
judge
then
expresses
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
warning
could
have
been
sufficient.
there
is
more
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
united
states
attorney.
we're
now
on
page
43.
the
judge
once
again
expresses
his
view
that
this
case
never
should
have
been
brought
because
of
the
trivial
amounts
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were
originally
mr.
justice
black
25
counts
showing
exaggerated
or
invented
deductions
in
amounts
ranging
from,
i
think,
for
each
taxpayer,
totals
somewhere
between
two
and
three,
or
$400.
eventually,
14
of
those
counts
were
removed
but
for
all
we
know
mr.
jorn
had
been
involved
in
this
occupation
for
some
time
and
was
expectedly
to
have
much
larger
number
of
taxpayers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
appears
from
colloquy
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
between
the
judge,
and
i
think,
defense
counsel
that
mr.
jorn
was
not
a
professional
accountant.
that
he
at
this
point
was
no
longer
in
this
tax
service
but
that
he
had
some
accounting
training
and
judging
from
this
particular
information
which
recites
several
tax
years
with
respect
to
each
of
the
taxpayers,
he
had
been
engaged
in
it
at
least
for
three
years
because
we
have
three
different
years
for
several
of
the
taxpayers.
we
just
don't
know
how
large
an
operation
it
was,
it
does
appear
that
the
taxpayers
involved
were
of
modest
income.
on
page
43
of
the
record,
the
court
finally
ends
the
colloquies
with
the
statement.
well,
i
will
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
in
this
case.
ladies
and
gentlemen,
it
won't
be
necessary
for
you
to
attend
the
court
any
further
on
this
matter
at
this
point,
with
this
charges
jury.
the
judge
then
requires
all
the
taxpayers
including
the
witnesses
who
had
been
excluded
under
the
rule
to
return
to
the
courtroom.
we're
now
on
page
44
of
the
record
and
he
once
again
and
for
the
better
part
of
three
pages
advises
them
with
respect
to
their
right
to
remain
silent,
their
right
not
to
testify,
his
decision
not
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
until
such
time
that
he
personally
has
had
a
further
opportunity
to
suggest
to
them
the
unwisdom
of
putting
themselves
in
danger
of
self-incrimination.
and
finally
the
judge
says,
“so,
this
case
is
vacated,
setting
is
vacated
this
afternoon
and
it
will
be
calendared
again.
and
before
it
is
calendared
again
i
am
going
to
have
this
witnesses
in
and
talk
to
them
before,
i
will
talk
to
them
again
before
i
will
permit
them
to
testify.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
wedsol
is
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
serving
a
case
for
the
government.
on
basis
of
the
facts
i've
just
recited,
it
seems
to
our
certain
propositions
of
not
subject
to
controversy.
the
first
is,
that
the
government
here,
the
united
states
attorney
was
in
no
way
at
fault,
no
way
guilty
of
misconduct,
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
ending,
premature
ending
of
this
trial
or
for
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
it
is
also
true
that
no
conduct
of
defense
made
this
course
inevitable.
however,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
statement
of
facts,
it
was
at
the
instance
of
defense
counsel
that
the
judge
proceeded
to
interrogate
the
witnesses
and
ultimately
to
declare
a
mistrial.
it
was
the
suggestion
of
defense
counsel
that
provoked
the
ultimate
action
declaring
a
mistrial.
now,
it
maybe
that
defense
counsel
had
in
mind
simply
that
the
judge
would
admonish
the
taxpayers
with
respect
to
their
rights.
no
doubt,
defense
counsel
hoped
that
such
advise
from
the
judge
might
change
the
minds
of
some
of
the
witnesses
with
respect
to
their
willingness
to
testify
or
their
decision
thus,
for
not
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
or
it
may
be
that
defense
counsel
anticipated
what
in
fact
did
happen.
we're
in
no
position
to
guess
about
that.
in
so
far
as
the
mistrial
is
the
consequence
of
a
defense
motion,
the
case
is
so
clearly
governed
by
prior
cases
of
this
court
that
i
need
not
dwell
on
that
aspect
of
it.
i
am
willing
to
argue
however
on
the
alternative
basis
that
the
defense
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
the
judge's
arbitrary
action
in
prematurely
ending
the
trial.
and
on
for
that
purpose
it
seems
to
us
we
can
assimilate
this
case
in
every
respect
with
gori
versus
united
states
cited
by
this
court
some
few
terms
ago.
they
also
adjudged
in
what
this
could
characterized
as
exaggerated
or
perhaps
exaggerated
solicitude
for
the
defendant
without
any
motion
from
the
defense
ordered
a
mistrial
and
the
question
was
whether
the
defendant
could
be
retried
subsequently.
the
court
held
that
he
could.
that
decision
as
well
as,
or
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
‘70
have
indicated
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
really
does
not
control
this
question
in
any
direct
sense.
double
jeopardy
clause
is
directly,
and
as
this
court
has
construed
it,
deals
more
immediately
with
the
problem
of
a
case
which
has
gone
to
verdict,
whether
a
verdict
of
acquittal
or
a
verdict
of
conviction.
a
mistrial,
which
is
of
course
neither
barred
re-prosecution
only
in
circumstances
where
either
and
i
think
this
is,
this
court's
decision
in
downum
where
to
allow
a
retrial
would
be
to
get
around
the
double
jeopardy
ball.
in
this
sense,
if
the
defendant
stood
a
good
chance
of
winning
an
acquittal
which
would
have
barred
his
retrial.
he
must
not
be
cheated
of
that
right
to
obtain
an
acquittal
by
action,
unjustified
action
made
at
the
door
of
the
prosecution
because
the
government
thinks
its
case
is
going
badly
and
in
that
sense,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
be
put
in
terms
of
fundamental
fairness
or
fundamental
unfairness.
we
put
it
in
terms
of
whether
the
action
of
the
court
was
taken
on
behalf
of
the
government,
whether
its
affect
was
to
harass
the
defense.
we
recognize
that
it
may
be
a
part
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
though
aside
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
have
a
case
brought
to
a
conclusion
before
the
jury
first
in
panel
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
right.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
precisely
that
example,
an
example
which
indicates
not
a
motion
of
the
defendant,
not
a
waiver
by
the
defendant
indicates
that
there
is
no
absolute
bar.
mr.
justice
washington
very
early
on
said,
double
jeopardy
clause
obviously
doesn't
control
this
situation
of
a
mistrial
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
no
exceptions
in
it
and
we
had
no
right
to
read
exceptions
into
it.
therefore,
this
is
a
case
not
governed
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
since
everyone
concedes
that
in
the
case
of
a
hung
jury,
for
instance,
there
must
be
a
right
in
the
public
in
the
prosecution
to
retry
even
though
no
argument
of
waiver
by
the
defense
could
possibly
be
advanced.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
the
early
termination
of
this
trial
after
it
have
only
technically
began
has
a
bearing
on
the
extent
to
which
the
defendant
was
harassed
by,
or
would
be
harassed
by,
a
new
prosecution.
he
has
not
undergone,
he
has
not
gone
through
the
gauntlet
in
any
real
sense
at
the
point
when
this
trial
was
aborted.
and
since
this
is
a
matter
not
governed
by
absolute
rules,
whose
considerations
it
seems
to
us
ought
to
be
relevant.
i
may
say
that
at
this,
of
this
invokes
the
decision
of
this
court
in
tateo
versus
united
states.
it
seems
to
us
also
relevant
that
in
the
case
of
a
trial
which
does
go
to
a
conclusion
but
which
is
reversed
on
appeal,
reversed
on
appeal
often
for
grounds
which
amount
to
characterizing
the
first
trial
as
a
mistrial,
an
erroneous
trial.
a
trial
in
many
instances
where
the
judge
should
have
halted
it
before
it
went
today.
that
situation
and
this
one
ought
not
be
so
radically
distinguished
and
yet
in
every
case
where
a
trial
which
is
reversed
on
appeal
allows
a
retrial
even
where
the
new
trial,
the
first
trial
was
reversed
for
lack
of
sufficient
evidence.
this
court
has
specifically
so
held.
and
why
the
result
should
be
so
different
because
the
judge
interposed
himself
early
rather
than
an
appellate
court
is
not
easy
to
appreciate.
the
difference
cannot
be
that
it
is
the
defendant
who
is
moving
for
a
new
trial
in
the
case
of
an
appeal
because
that
would
be
an
instance
in
which
a
defendant
was
required
in
order
to
observe
one
constitutional
right,
constitutional
right
to
reverse
so
long
for
constitutional
error
to
waive
a
supposed
other
constitutional
right,
the
right
not
to
be
retried,
that
is
the
right
created
in
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
follows
from
this
that
it
is
not
the
defendant's
motion
that
makes
a
new
trial
permissible
in
the
case
of
the
trial
which
is
not
the
verdict.
it
must
be
a
balancing
of
interest
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
deal
with
and
the
defendant's
motion
and
any
notion
of
waiver
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
rule
permitting
this.
for
these
several
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
below
ought
to
be
reversed
and
that
the
prosecution
be
free
to
proceed
with
a
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
one,
one
comment
mr.
chief
justice.
i
agree
with
counsel
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
correctly
stated
in
the
quotation
you
made
attributed
to
a
member
of
this
court
that
the
issue
is
way
off
the
risk
of
judicial
arbitrariness
must
fall
in
these
circumstances.
that
statement
is
taken
from
the
descending
opinion
in
gory
versus
united
states.we
invoke
the
charity
opinion
in
that
same
case
which
has
never
been
repudiated
not
of
the
downum
decision
or
of
the
subsequent
decision
in
tateo
versus
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
doubts
of
considerations
here
requires
that
in
the
case
where
a
judge,
as
this
judge
you
must
conclude
has,
arbitrarily
and
without
the
need
for
doing
so,
declares
a
mistrial
but
not
at
the
instance
of
the
government,
not
for
the
advantage
of
the
government
that
the
provisions
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
do
not
prevent
retrial
of
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
court
will,
i
think,
shortly
perhaps
have
that
problem
not
quite
in
the
same
sense
of
a
mistrial.
the
case
of
a
judge
who
indicated
that
he
would
unless
restrained,
granted,
directed
verdict
or
acquittal
but
had
not
done
so
and
attempted
to
leave
the
government
free
to
follow
an
appeal.
i
suppose
that
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
here
or
if
the
judge
would
indicate
that
unless
restrained
by
the
appellate
court
he
intended
declared
a
mistrial.
in
the
meantime,
simply
granted
a
continuance
allowing
the
government
not
to
receive
a
mandamus
in
the
high
court,
nothing
would
prevent
the
high
court
from
entertaining
and
granting
such
a
writ.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
fong
foo,
i
think.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
had
thought
that
i
may
be
quite
wrong,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
was
done
after
the
judge
acting
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
intimation
that
he
was
going
to
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
question
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
issue
mandamus
when
the
judge
has
indicated
his
intention
but
has
not
yet
entered
the
order
is
a
difficult
one
which
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeal
did
entertain
and
did
grant
mandamus
against
judge
dooling
in
recent
instance
when
the
government
applied
to
that
court
at
what
amounted
to
judge
dooling's
suggestion
he
is
having
reckoned
an
opinion
indicating
his
intention
to
enter
an
order
of
acquittal
on
unless
the
appellate
court
would
otherwis
and
if
i
remembering
facts,
correctly
the
second
circuit
did
issue
mandamus
and
did
restrain
the
judge
from
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir.
i
think
--
i
think,
this
could
be
denied.
the
case
may
well
likely
recur
because
it
was
a
question
of
there
was
an
appeal
on
the
merits
subsequently.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
he
was
put
in
jeopardy.
the
question
whether
that
jeopardy
was
erased
by
the
occurrence
of
mistrial
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
that
seems
to
be
one
justification
for
the
notion
of
a
new
trial
say
after
a
hung
jury
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
initial
jeopardy
washes
out
in
the
absence
of
a
verdict.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
think
that
question
is
resolved
by
the
tateo
case
in
which
this
court
entertained
a
direct
appeal.
the
tateo
case,
tateo
versus
the
united
states,
not
a
mistrial
a
case
in
which
a
man
clearly
had
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
didn't
even
find
the
problem
which
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
construe
3731
as
meaning
in
jeopardy
on
the
trial
from
which
the
owner
is
sought
to
be,
from
which
the
appeal
is
sought
to
be
taken.
if
a
man
had
been
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
at
the
second
--
at
the
second
trial
he
was
not
in
jeopardy,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted
before
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
government
filed
an
appeal
before
jeopardy
had
sit
in
on
the
second
trial.
if
a
man
had
been
convicted
30
years
before
and
plead
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
may
say
that
every
member
of
this
court
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
the
mersky
case,
where
this
court
divided
on
the
question
of
what
was
a
plea
involved,
your
honor
write
in
one
opinion,
mr.
justice
stewart
writing
another.
the
stricter
view
taken
by
mr.
justice
stewart
gave
as
examples
of
the
kind
of
plea
involved
which
was
directly
appealable
to
this
court,
a
plea
which
set
up
the
claim
of
double
jeopardy.
that
is
the
classical
plea
involved.
if
that
were
not
appealable
then
no
case
under
the
plea
bar
section
of
3731
would
ever
reach
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that's
conceded
by
my
opponent.
however,
i
think
it
really
doesn't.
this
isn't
the
case
where
jurisdiction
turns
on
the
merits.
jurisdiction
as
this
court
noted
when
it
did
not
postpone
the
question
of
jurisdiction
exists
in
either
event
even
if
you
should
rule
against
the
government,
there
would
have
been
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeal
because
the
appeal,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
three
months
earlier
that
the
first
trial
occurred
30
years
earlier
of
three
weeks
earlier
this
is
a
wholly
separate
proceeding.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
some
previous
time
in
some
previous
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
so
we
think
this
court
has
in
effect
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
often
does
happen
that
sometime
after
the
trial
has
preceded
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
repeat
that,
first,
this
court
has
actually
entertained
an
appeal
in
such
as
a
case
in
tateo
where
the
man
had
been
on
trial
for
40
years.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
that
objection
had
been
made.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
if
the
objection
was
raised.
i'll
say
further
that
this
court
and
i
think
all
judges
had
recognized
the
classical
case
of
an
appealable
ruling
sustaining
a
motion
involved
is
a
ruling
to
the
effect
that
the
man
at
some
previous
time
had
been
in
jeopardy.
and
if
that
were
not
appealable,
then
they
would
not
be
in
a
strict
view
any
appealable
motion,
rulings
on
motions
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
it
could.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
the
way
downum
came
up
and
the
way
gori
came
up.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
if
it
is
not
appealable
to
this
court,
it
is
not
appealable
anywhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
by
the
government.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
sorry,
i
am
sorry
to
i
interrupted
you
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
mr.
justice
black
that
your
example
assumes
if
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
then
entered
by
the
jury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
did
the
verdict
of
acquittal
was
then
entered
by
the
jury
after
the
judge
had
excluded
the
evidence
of
these
witnesses?
of
course,
at
that
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
they
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
there
had
been
no
verdict
that
if
we
have
the
same
problem
we
have
here
if
there
had
been
a
verdict
of
acquittal
then
i
agree
that
there
could
have
been
no
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
jeopardy
would
have
attached
but
would
not,
there
is
a
sort
of
mystique,
the
jeopardy
attaches
from
the
swearing
of
the
first
juror
but
that
affect
may
not
carry
over
if
the
expected
conclusion
of
the
trial
that
is
a
verdict
does
not
take
place
and
that
must
be
the
rationale
for
a
hung
jury
which
does
allow
a
retrial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
am
clear,
mr.
justice
black
in
your
example,
what
it
is
that
prevented
a
verdict
from
being
returned,
but
that
is
the
critical
think
(voice

mr.
louis

well,
there
are
many
such
errors
of
things
which
the
government
has
no
recourse
and
as
i
say
if
that
error
had
resulted
in
the
verdict
of
acquittal,
that
would
have
been
an
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
then
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
strictly
speaking
there
must
be
a
verdict
or
acquittal
or
a
conviction.
