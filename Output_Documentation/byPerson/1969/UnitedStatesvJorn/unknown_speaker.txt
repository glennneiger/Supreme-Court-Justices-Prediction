mr.
morrill,
may
i
ask?
is
it
in
your
position
that
while
an
appeal
would
not
lie
to
this
court
under
the
1970
statute?
it’s
dealt
with
appeal
of
this
court.
but
do
you
also
say
it
would
not
lie
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
1942
amendment?
in
other
words,
even
if
it
does
not
lie
here,
may
we
transfer
it
under
the
transfer
provisions
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should
think
that’s
involved
here
even
if
you
can’t
appeal
here.
if
it
is
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
suppose
it’s
our
responsibility
to
transfer
it
there.
unknown
speaker
that’s
under
the
42
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don’t
suppose
they
--
feel
anywhere
of
this
amount
to
an
equivalence?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
was
an
acquittal
in
effect
as
in
sisson?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morrill,
can
you
take
the
view
that
this
at
least
was
within
the
judges’
discretion.
in
other
words,
it
was
tried,
they
were
the
government
and
they
were
in
defense
rightly
or
wrongly,
they
made
the
ruling
as
they
did
but
still.
but
this
court
i
should
not
say
it
was
not
with
in
the
discretion.
it
is
ought
to
--
do
you
think
it
would
be
under
the
posture
then
under
cases
we
have
decided
under
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
apply
the
pending
appeals?
unknown
speaker
that
is
to
give
lawyers
happy
news.
