well,
suppose
mr.
claiborne
that
if
you
win
under
--
if
you
are
right
under
jeopardy
point,
then
the
decision
--
that
decision
on
the
merits
also
clears
up
the
jurisdictional
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
you
have
jurisdiction,
we
do
have
jurisdiction
of
entertaining
the
appeal
even
though
there
has
been,
he
has
been
put
in
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
have
been
not
the
justice
and
justice
harlan’s
hypothetical
that
would
have
been
pretty
close
equivalent
to
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
a
--
there’s
a
decision
in
this
court
right
along
those
lines
in
the
first
circuit.
that
however
wrong,
however
mistaken
was
the
directed
verdict
to

justice

right.
justice
byron

even
if
he
had
made
the
motion
for
mistrial
had
been
granted
the
fact
that
he
had
been
on
jeopardy
still
exists
and
this
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
appellate
jurisdiction
on
this
case
and
if
the
statute
says,
no
appeal
or
once
the
defendant
had
been
put
in
jeopardy,
what
difference
does
it
make
[voice
overlap]
for
this
trials
--
during
the
trial
that
may
be
a
question
where
we
can
be
retried
but
it
may
not
affect
the
question
on
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn’t
sisson
--
did
read
sisson
in
saying
that
appeal
just
isn’t
allowed
when
the
defendant
has
been
put
on
jeopardy
even
if
he
could
be
retried?
justice
byron

white
nor
the
government’s
previous
practice.
justice
byron

but
sometimes
when
jeopardy
is
attached
you
can
appeal
and
sometimes
when
it’s
attached
you
can’t?
justice

i
guess
if
the
government
isn’t
suggesting
that

appeals
act
isn’t

that
the
criminal
appeals
act
should
be
construed
to
me
and
that
you
can
appeal
unless
he
can’t
be
retried?
justice
