was
mr.
jorn
a
professional
tax
adviser
or

justice
potter
stewart
who's
mr.
wedsol.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
take
the
test
then
basically
of
--
one
of
the
fundamental
fairness
or
fundamental
unfairness?
justice
potter
stewart
that
certainly,
that
certainly
does
apply
in
the
event
of
a
jury
that
disagrees.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody,
there
were
nobody
who
ever
claimed
that
after
mistrial
caused
by
a
hung
jury
that
there
cannot
be
another
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think,
i
gather
from
your
argument,
the
logic
of
your
argument
is
that
the
more
wrong
that
the
district
judge
was,
the
more
erroneous
was
his
action
in
dismissing
the
jury,
the
stronger
your
case
is.
is
that,
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
in
other
words,
if
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
a
mistrial
that
any
rational
competent
judge
would
not
have
no
choice
but
declare,
but
to
declare
a
mistrial
because
it
is
only
that
or
another.
i
gather
that
you
concede
that
there
could
then
be
a
new
trial,
a
new
prosecution.
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
no
such
necessity,
no
such
absolute
necessity
and
the
trial
judge
irrationally
or
erroneously
declare
a
mistrial
then
there
cannot
be
a
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
logic
of
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
we
had
a
case
here
some
few
years
ago
involving
what
seem
to
be
an
entirely
irrational
and
erroneous
direction
of
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
--
justice
potter
stewart
fong
foo,
i
think
was
the
name
of
the
case
and
that
was,
the
government
sought
to
remedy
that
by
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
--
and
that
which
was
granted
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
reversed
here,
am
i
correct
in
my
own
recollection?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
but
he
had
--
the
judge
had
indicated
his
intention
of
doing
this
in
the
government
purely
go
powerless
to
permit
it
and
in
fact
the
more
they
represented,
the
government
seem
to
say
the
more
the
district
judge
became
determined
he
was
going
to
grant
a
judgment
of
acquittal
simply,
as
i
remember
to
show
his
displeasure
with
the
conduct
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
and
then
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
way
of
mandamus
directed,
i
guess,
that
judgment
to
be
set
aside
and
that
was
reversed
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
we
grant
certiorari
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
double
jeopardy
motion
in
this
case
was
made
before
the
jury
was
impaneled
in
the
second
trial
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
whole
what?
justice
potter
stewart
the
act
does
say
in
all
of
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
this
is
a
rider
to
another
bill?
justice
potter
stewart
which
one?
justice
potter
stewart
was
mr.
