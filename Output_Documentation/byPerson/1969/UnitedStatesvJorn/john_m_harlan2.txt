what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
judge
ritter
did
handle
the
jury
and
then
said,
“now,
gentlemen
this
is
a
peewee
prosecution,
i
am
not
in
favor
of
them
and
i
am
going
to
just
dismiss
this
jury.”
what
would
be
the

then
if
the
government
wanted
to
go
ahead
and
retrial
and
forward
it
to
another
judge?
