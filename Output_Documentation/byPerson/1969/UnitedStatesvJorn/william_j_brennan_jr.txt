justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
mr.
claiborne
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
3731,
as
i
understand
it
standard
allows
an
appeal
as
the
government
took
the
appeal
here,
the
direct
appeal.
only
when
he's
not
been
put
into
jeopardy,
now
your
confession
that
it
was
in
some
state,
doesn't
that
bear
on
whether
or
not
you're
properly
here
on
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
we
say
he
had
been?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
the
respondent
has
raised
a
question
here
whether
you're
properly
here
on
direct
appeal,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
maybe
a
difficult
question
if
the
government
concedes
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black,
that
at
one
stage
he
was
put
in
jeopardy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
put
in
jeopardy
you
will
certainly
be
put
in
jeopardy
on
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
plead
double
jeopardy
here
on
the
second
trial,
made
a
motion,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prosecution
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
put
in
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
reading
--
your
reading
of
3731
is
that
it's
the
order
of
dismissal
of
the
second
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
had
any
authority
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
has
not
been
put
is
jeopardy
relates
in
point
of
time
with
the
second
trial
it
was
the
prosecution
that
was
dismissed,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
ever
--
i
can't
understand
that
because
how
can
you
ever
be
put
in
jeopardy
on
the
second
trial
when
they
interpose
a
plea
about
to
acquit
or
convict
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
you'll
ask
dismissal
of
the
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
does,
and
the
ordinary
situation
like
this
where
you
are
relying
on
the
prior
trial
as
the
basis
of
your
motion
on
whether
to
acquit
or
convict,
why
doesn't
the
statute
refer
to
put
in
jeopardy
in
the
first
instance
not
the
second?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
know
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
we
faced
with
this
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
we
might
but
i
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
first,
that's
the
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
question
is
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
on
direct
appeal.
that's
what
the
statute
raises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
the
position
in
sisson
took.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
accept
it?
do
you
accept
as
you
deal
with
the
--
do
you
insist
and
talk
as
to
what
jeopardy
meant?
then
in
this
case
and
sisson
would
say
their
jurisdiction
--
their
motion
was
made
before
the
jury
in
the
second
trials.
we
were
talking
not
about
a
second
trial
and
only
one
trial
but
so
you
are
literally
within
the
full
terms
of
sisson,
don’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
am
thinking
though,
is
though
what
leads
on
the
bar
does
direct
appeal
hear?
meaning
not
whether
jeopardy
is
actually
attached
but
whether
there
is
a
substantial
question
whether
jeopardy
has
(inaudible)?
but
in
that
circumstance,
an
appeal
here
in
the
board
that
does
not
answer
the
question
rather
than
appeal
where
there
is
only
a
substantial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
mean
is
you
don’t
agree
with
me?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
you
mean
that
you
don’t
agree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
perhaps
before
the
end
of
this
session.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
the
difference
between
the
house
and
the
senate
version?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
precisely
what
does
it
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope
the
option
has
exercised
its
favor
in
the
court
of
appeals.
