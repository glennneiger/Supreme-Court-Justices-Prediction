were

chief

is
there
more

would
you
say
to
have
a
stringent
rule
on
double

where
the

has
gone
forward

put
in
his

in

your

he

this

in

of

we

in

chief

counsel,
what
if
the
defense

had
moved
for

after

a

do
you
think
he
would

--
the

here
would
have,
or
the

here
would
have
waived
all
claims
with

chief

e.

suppose
--
would
it
be
possible,
may
i
have
your
comment
on
this
to
treat
the
conduct
of
defense
counsel
in
putting
the
questions
he
did
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
without
attempting
at
the
moment
to
characterize
that
conduct.
could
that
be
construed,
you
put
it
on
invitation
as
good
as
in
effect
of
motion
for
a
mistrial
creating
a
mistrial
situation
and
therefore
make
the

at
the
trial

level
bear
the
burden
in
fact?
chief

e.

thank
you

mr.

chief

warren
e.

i
have
forgotten
mr.
morrill
from
the
record.
did
you
try
this
case
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
there’s
another
quarrel
area
that
might
be
relevant
in
light
of
what
you
have
suggested
and
that
is
if
the
defense
--
if
the
conduct
of
the
defense
is
so
flagrant
that
it
suggest
a
possible
atmosphere
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
in
the
continuance
of
the
trial,
then
the
defendant
can
insulate
himself
after
that
conduct
by
not
making
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
and
not
acquiescing
in
that
motion.
isn’t
that
correct
analysis
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
the
defense
benefits
by
its
own
misconduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
agree
with
your
friend’s
characterization
of
the
judges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
had
gone
on
with
the
trial
and
the
judge
had
not
thereafter
taken
the
action
he
did.
i
suppose
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
taking
advantage
of
the
judge’s
remarks
and
if
you
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
review,
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
claiming
that
his
remarks
were
prejudicial
to
your
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
attendants
here
to
suggest
the
whole
atmosphere
of
criminal
conduct,
didn’t
they
on
the
part
of
someone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
might
be
an
alternative
if
the
court
felt
that
the
conduct
of
the
defense
in
opening
up
this
line
of
questioning
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
is
what
brought
all
this
on
then
it
might
be
equated
as
mr.
stone
suggested
to
a
motion
by
the
defense
for
a
mistrial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrill
just
one
more
question
if
i
may.
are
there
any
more
than
two
alternative
ways
of
construing
judge
ritter’s
action
that
is
one,
it
was
a
declaration
of
a
mistrial
without
actually
using
the
word
mistrial.
or
two,
it
was
as
someone
suggested
possibly
a
directed
verdict,
are
there
any
other
alternatives
than
either
number
one
or
number
two
that
i
have
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the

he
used

would
you
agree?
