mr.
denis
r.
morrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
adequately
stated
the
facts.
i
would
amplify
on
this
--
in
certain
instances.
first,
i
believe
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
a
peculiar
relationship
existed
in
this
case
between
the
defendant
and
the
taxpayer
witnesses
called
to
testify
against
him.
defendant
was
accused
in
the
information
of
aiding
and
assisting
in
procuring
and
counseling
and
advising
in
the
preparation
of
false
and
fraudulent
tax
returns.
the
returns
involved
are
the
returns
of
the
very
witnesses
who
were
testifying.
the
internal
revenue
service
had
determined
that
these
returns
were
erroneous,
were
fraudulent
in
their
view.
therefore,
if
defendant
was
not
guilty
of
the
fraud,
then
the
taxpayers
may
well
have
been
guilty.
from
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
matter,
i,
being
defense
counsel
at
that
time,
it
was
my
feeling
that
some
of
these
witnesses
were
trying
to
blame
their
errors
upon
the
defendant
and
thus
escape
prosecution
from
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
thank
you,
sir.
for
this,
based
upon
the
relationship
between
the
taxpayers
and
the
defendant
in
this
case,
one
facet
of
the
defense
prepared
was
to
show
that
these
people
had
given
the
information
to
defendant
from
which
he
prepared
their
returns.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
wished
to
convey
to
the
jury
that
these
witnesses
were
trying
to,
in
essence
blame
him
for
their
mistake.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
counsel
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
he
felt
these
witnesses
should
be
warned
of
their
rights.
this
was
certainly
not
tantamount
to
any
motion
for
a
mistrial.
after
this
warning
was
given
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
government,
the
jury
was
summarily
dismissed
with
no
opportunity
on
either
side
for
objection.
from
the
law,
as
stated
by
this
court,
it
appears
to
me
that
once
a
jury
in
impaneled
to
try
a
criminal
case,
it
may
only
be
dismissed
by
the
court
in
rare
and
extraordinary
circumstances.
the
task
which
has
been
verbalized
is
often
referred
to
as
a
manifest
and
necessity
test
wherein
the
jury
is
to
be
discharged
only
if
there
is
a
manifest
and
necessity
in
doing
so
in
order
to
preserve
substantial
justice.
the
cases
of
this
court
have
held
that
the
discretion
of
a
trial
court
in
granting
a
mistrial
while
not
closely
scrutinized
certainly
is
not
unlimited.
i
believe
that
the
instant
case
shows
no
extraordinary
circumstance
nor
any
manifest
necessity
for
granting
a
mistrial.
the
trial
court,
after
warning
these
witnesses,
concluded
that
he
would
not
allow
them
to
testify.
whether
this
is
a
legally
defensible
conclusion,
i
believe
at
this
point
is
irrelevant.
after
so
concluding,
the
trial
court
took
a
further
step
which
should
be
distinguished
i
believe
from
the
first
that
is
he
dismissed
the
jury.
certainly
the
second
step
did
not
follow
from
the
first.
trial
court
had
several
discretionary
alternatives
which
he
could
have
followed,
if
he
in
fact
felt
these
witnesses
should
have
a
more
explicit
warning
than
he
had
given
them.
he
could
have
recessed
the
court
overnight
which
would
have
given
ample
opportunity
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose.
he
could
have
called
counsel
to
the
court.
there
are
counsel
available
close
which
he
could
have
requested.
he
did
not
do
this.
he
dismissed
the
jury.
i
believe
the
alternative
which
he
chose
clearly
was
not
dictated
by
any
manifest
necessity.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
would
be
the
logic
of
my
argument.
that
has
been
stated
by
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
that
the
risk
of
judicial
arbitrariness
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
defendant
but
rather
should
be
placed
upon
the
government
in
this
instance.
then
too,
i
believe
the
position
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
is
rather
unique
and
that
the
same
court
that
granted
this
mistrial
or
discharged
the
jury,
some
five
months
later,
on
reviewing
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
granted
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
based
upon
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
would
appear
to
me
that
this
judge
was
in
excellent
position
to
review
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
and
that
in
granting
this
motion,
he
concluded
that
in
his
prior
action
he
had
abused
his
discretion.
abuse
of
this
discretion,
prejudiced
the
defendant
and
for
this
reason
the
action
in
dismissing
the
information
should
be
affirmed.
this
court
has
also
held
in
downum
versus
united
states
that
a
mistrial
declared
in
the
aid
of
prosecution
would
prevent
retrial.
upon
separating
the
action
of
the
trial
judge
into
two
parts,
the
first,
his
opinion
or
conclusion
that
this
witnesses
could
not
testify
and
second,
the
dismissing
of
the
jury,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced.
after
concluding
that
the
witnesses
could
not
testify,
had
the
court
continued
the
trial,
there's
no
question
of
what
a
verdict
of
acquittal
would
have
been
forthcoming
since
these
were
all
of
the
government's
witnesses.
in
both
the
gori
case
and
the
tateo
case
relied
upon
by
the
government,
retrial
was
allowed
after
a
mistrial
in
the
one
case,
after
conviction
in
the
other,
both
times
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
accused.
this
court,
i
believe,
will
rather
heavily
unmet
argument.
the
rights
of
the
accused
were
being
protected.
in
the
instant
case,
the
dismissal
of
the
jury
clearly
was
not
for
the
protection
of
mr.
jorn.
any
possible
beneficiaries
of
this
action
were
the
witnesses
and
of
course
the
government.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
because
after
the
judge
took
the
first
step
of
not
allowing
any
other
witnesses
to
testify
they
had
no
case.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
well,
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
no
he
couldn't.
ultimately
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
perhaps
it's
a
peculiarity
of
that
particular
court,
he
did
order
that
this
witnesses
would
not
be
allowed
to
testify.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
this
is
true,
this
is
true
your
honor.
it
is
the
defendant's
position
that
once
the
jury
was
impaneled,
evidence
was
taken
from
one
witness,
another
witness
was
sworn,
jeopardy
attached
and
pursuant
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
cases
of
this
court,
defendant
cannot
now
be
retried.
either
this
appeal
should
be
dismissed
because
under
section
3731,
if
jeopardy
had
attached,
no
appeal
would
lie
or
the
action
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
facts
as
stated
by
mr.
stone
are
accurate
and
sufficient
for
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
your
honor
i
did,
yes.
the
offset
i
believe
that
this
question
before
the
court
is
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
that
under
section
3731,
the
government
does
not
have
a
right
of
appeal.
in
sisson,
recently
decided
by
this
court
and
mentioned
by
mr.
stone,
this
court
clearly
stated
that
once
jeopardy
has
attached
and
appealed,
it
does
not
lie
for
the
government.
the
government
here
is
arguing
something
that
frankly
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
that
if
the
jeopardy
we
are
talking
about
is
the
jeopardy
in
the
second
trial,
then
no
appeal
would
lie.
but
if
it’s
the
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial,
there
is
an
appeal.
this
it
seems
to
me
does
considerable
violence
to
any
possible
interpretation
of
a
legislative
history
of
that
act.
this
would
make
it
frankly
so
that
the
defendant
by
the
timing
of
this
motion
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
an
appeal.
if
we
have
waited
until
the
jury
had
been
sworn
in
the
second
case
and
then
made
a
motion
based
on
double
jeopardy,
then
the
government
would
admit
there
could
have
been
no
appeal.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
this
is
correct,
unless
they
try
to
prosecute
him
again.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
would
be
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
could
be
mr.
chief
justice
a
corollary
and
it
appears
to
me
however
that
we’re
talking
here
about
the
legislative
intent
in
passing
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
whether
this
could
in
fact
happen.
i
don’t
think
it’s
relevant
to
that
intent.
in
the
instant
case
the
government
has
set
forth
the
facts
relating
to
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial.
if
you
can
call
it
a
mistrial,
there
was
no
formal
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
the
court
and
i
agree
with
the
prosecution,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anyone
once
the
court
began
his
discussions
with
these
witnesses,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anyone
to
make
any
kind
of
a
motion
before
it
was
all
over,
so
i
believe
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
object.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
over
before
i
even
could
get
in
the
words.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
certainly
do
your
honor.
i
believe
the
judges’
action
was
arbitrary
and
was
not
necessary.
clearly,
the
judge
could
have
done
it
a
different
way
but
i
also
agree
with
what
mr.
justice
white
said,
i
don’t
think
that
makes
any
difference
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
that
would
make
a
difference
to
the
constitutional
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
be
retried
on
a
constitutional
method.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
frankly,
your
honor,
i
haven’t
concerned
myself
with
that
question
and
i
really
couldn’t
answer
it.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
it
does.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
right.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that’s
correct.
my
second
point
here
will
be
that
constitutional
double
jeopardy
is
involved
and
he
couldn’t
be
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
believe,
yes
that
you
can
interpret
the
action
of
the
judge
and
i’ll
have
to
agree
with
mr.
stone
that
from
the
beginning
and
one
assumption
practiced
in
this
court,
mr.
judge
ritter’s
court
frequently
has
this
happen.
it
was
apparent
from
the
offset
that
he
does
not
want
this
prosecution
to
continue
and
it
is
my
position
however
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
be
tried
before
this
jury
and
any
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
the
judge
cannot
be
used
on
the
prejudice
of
the
defendant
that
the
government
must
bear
the
risk
of
his
arbitrary.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
could
have
been
claimed.
i
will
have
to
agree
candidly
with
mr.
stone,
i
don’t
think
they
would
have
prejudiced
my
client.
after
the
judges,
if
you
break
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes
they
did,
however
more
on
the
part
of
the
witnesses
who
were
going
to
testify.
the
judge
as
i
recall
did
not
really
say
anything
about
the
defendant
but
indicate
what
these
witnesses
had
done
may
subject
them
for
later
prosecution.
if
you
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
double
jeopardy
set
forth
in
downum
and
gori
and
tateo,
i
believe
this
action
by
the
judge
while
you
could
characterize
it
as
not
being
arbitrary
still
was
in
no
way
as
set
forth
in
those
cases
favoring
the
defendant.
if
you
break
the
judges’
action
down
in
its
two
parts
first,
he
felt
that
the
witnesses
should
not
testify
until
they’ve
been
warned
and
he
then
said
“i’m
not
going
to
let
you
testify
until
you
have
been
warned.”
and
then
at
second
part
he
turns
and
dismisses
the
jury.
well
if
you
stopped
after
the
first
part,
clearly
there
were
many
alternatives
available.
this
could
have
been
done
in
an
hour’s
time,
they
could
have
consulted
counsel,
the
trial
could
have
gone
on
but
predisposed
as
the
judge
was
to
refuse
to
allow
them
to
testify
had
the
trial
have
been
going
on.
there
is
no
doubt
but
what
it
would
have
been
a
directed
acquittal
for
the
defendant.
there
were
no
witnesses
and
there
was
no
way
that
the
trial
could
continue
on
the
part
of
the
government
at
that
time
once
he
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
those
witnesses
testify.
so
it
would
be
my
position
then
that
any
solicitude
on
the
part
of
anyone
by
the
judge
was
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
this
i
think
fits
squarely
within
downum
that
the
jury
was
dismissed
in
order
to
allow
the
prosecution
to
more
favorable
opportunity
to
convict.
they
couldn’t
have
convicted
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
well,
in
that
situation
and
i
will
have
to
admit
there
is
not
much
difference
between
the
hypothetical
that
you
post
and
the
instant
case
except
one
witness
did
testify
here.
i
believe
my
position
would
have
to
be
that
the
government
is
powerless.
that
the
risk
of
this
judicial
arbitrariness,
this
defendant
was
entitled
to
be
tried
by
the
jury
impaneled
to
hear
this
case.
and
if
for
some
reason
other
than
his
own
conduct
this
is
prevented,
i
believe
that
the
cases
of
this
court
would
have
to
hold
that
he
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy
and
a
second
prosecution
would
be
twice
in
jeopardy
and
prohibited.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that’s
true
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
believe
on
the
facts
and
the
record
and
subjectively
since
i
was
there
that
there
was
no
way
the
remarks
by
counsel
in
this
case
could
have
foreseeable
precipitated
the
action
that
happened.
i
frankly
did
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
these
witnesses
were
warned
because
i
intended
to
show
that
it
was
they,
and
not
my
client
who
had
committed
the
crime
and
this
was
the
reason
i
felt
they
should
be
warned
of
their
constitutional
rights.
so
while
it
is
open
to
interpretation
that
my
remarks
caused
the
action
of
the
judge,
i
think
that
it
was
not
case.
i
think
the
record
indicates
a
predisposition
of
the
judge
prior
to
the
time
i
made
any
remarks
with
regard
to
this
particular
prosecution.
counsel
for
the
government
has
mentioned
there
was
a
pretrial
and
possibly,
i
mean
it
was
a
preliminary
hearing
and
possibly
this
could
have
been
taken
care
of
earlier.
judge
ritter
did
not
hear
the
preliminary
hearing.
and
the
record
in
the
preliminary
hearing
as
he
stated
was
the
cause
of
dismissing
of
many
of
the
counts
of
the
information
and
it
was
my
--
that
was
where
i
developed
my
feeling
that
it
may
have
been
the
witnesses
rather
than
the
defendant
who
actually
committed
a
crime
and
this
is
why
i
made
the
motion.
i
suppose
it
could
have
been
made
at
an
earlier
time
but
as
a
fact,
it
wasn’t.
going
the
jurisdictional
question,
again,
i
believe
the
legislative
history
of
section
3731,
which
was
discussed
by
this
court
and
system,
while
it
is
ambiguous
in
places,
indicates
that
the
legislature
in
passing
this
criminal
appeals
act
was
very
concerned
that
it
be
limited
strictly
to
its
terms.
there
are
remarks
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
the
--
at
least
some
of
the
senators
debating
this
bill
understood
the
difference
between
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
and
constitutional
double
jeopardy.
i
think
you
must
separate
those
two
questions
because
jeopardy
attaches
and
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
it
attaches
every
time
the
jury
is
formed,
so
that’s
one
question.
the
constitution
comes
into
play
on
a
proposed
retrial,
then
the
motion
is
that
the
defendant
is
being
put
twice
in
jeopardy.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
argue
that
jeopardy.
and
this
has
been
decided
at
least
by
four
members
of
this
court
in
sisson
if
you
--
that
jeopardy
in
section
3731
must
mean
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
not
the
constitutional
standard
because
the
constitution
was
there
and
will
be
there
long
before
the
statute.
there
was
no
reason
for
the
legislature
to
incorporate
a
constitutional
standard
in
the
statute.
it
was
there
and
they
couldn’t
change
what
the
constitution
means
by
double
jeopardy.
i
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
question
of
jeopardy
was
--
the
words
put
in
jeopardy
were
placed
in
the
statute
to
strictly
limit
an
appeal
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cases
in
which
there
had
been
no
jury
impaneled.
that
is
the
motion
in
bar
cases
clearly
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
is
the
position
that
four
members
of
this
court
took
in,
in
sisson
and
i
believe
that
holding
prevents
a
retrial
in
this
case
because
jeopardy
had
attached.
and
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
separate
the
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial
and
say
as
government
argues
that
you
can
retry
him
unless
he
waits
until
jeopardy
has
attached
in
the
second
trial
to
make
his
motion.
i
believe
that
the
jurisdictional
question
disposes
of
the
case.
however,
i
also
believe
that
the
defendant
has
been
constitutionally
placed
in
jeopardy
within
the
meaning
of
this
court’s
cases.
specifically
that
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
sisson
is
limited
so
i
don’t
think
it
reads
that
way.
sisson
to
me
seems
to
say
that
once
a
jury
has
been
impaneled,
it
doesn’t
say
whether
a
first
jury
or
second
jury,
the
facts
are
as
you
state
them.
there
was
no
second
jury
there
and
in
fact
there
was
no
second
jury
in
this
case.
but
that
once
jeopardy
has
attached
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
these
legislators
did
not
intend
to
give
the
government
a
right
of
appeal.
i
would
request
that
this
court
dismiss
the
appeal
and
even
if
the
appeal
were
granted,
i
feel
that
under
the
cases
of
this
court
the
defendant
has
been
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
and
neither
the
constitution
cannot
now
be
retried.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
off
hand,
i
don’t
see
any
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
appears
from
the
record
to
be
the
case.
however,
five
months
later
when
in
fact
the
case,
the
government
had
the
case
placed
back
on
the
calendar
and
our
motion
was
made,
the
judge
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
double
jeopardy.
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
himself
in
reviewing
his
action
in
the
prior
case
had
determined
that
the
defendant
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy
by
his
action.
now
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes
and
possibly
could
be
construed
as
having
acquitted
the
defendant.
thank
you.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
adequately
stated
the
facts.
i
would
amplify
on
this
--
in
certain
instances.
first,
i
believe
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
a
peculiar
relationship
existed
in
this
case
between
the
defendant
and
the
taxpayer
witnesses
called
to
testify
against
him.
defendant
was
accused
in
the
information
of
aiding
and
assisting
in
procuring
and
counseling
and
advising
in
the
preparation
of
false
and
fraudulent
tax
returns.
the
returns
involved
are
the
returns
of
the
very
witnesses
who
were
testifying.
the
internal
revenue
service
had
determined
that
these
returns
were
erroneous,
were
fraudulent
in
their
view.
therefore,
if
defendant
was
not
guilty
of
the
fraud,
then
the
taxpayers
may
well
have
been
guilty.
from
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
matter,
i,
being
defense
counsel
at
that
time,
it
was
my
feeling
that
some
of
these
witnesses
were
trying
to
blame
their
errors
upon
the
defendant
and
thus
escape
prosecution
from
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
thank
you,
sir.
for
this,
based
upon
the
relationship
between
the
taxpayers
and
the
defendant
in
this
case,
one
facet
of
the
defense
prepared
was
to
show
that
these
people
had
given
the
information
to
defendant
from
which
he
prepared
their
returns.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
wished
to
convey
to
the
jury
that
these
witnesses
were
trying
to,
in
essence
blame
him
for
their
mistake.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
counsel
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
he
felt
these
witnesses
should
be
warned
of
their
rights.
this
was
certainly
not
tantamount
to
any
motion
for
a
mistrial.
after
this
warning
was
given
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
government,
the
jury
was
summarily
dismissed
with
no
opportunity
on
either
side
for
objection.
from
the
law,
as
stated
by
this
court,
it
appears
to
me
that
once
a
jury
in
impaneled
to
try
a
criminal
case,
it
may
only
be
dismissed
by
the
court
in
rare
and
extraordinary
circumstances.
the
task
which
has
been
verbalized
is
often
referred
to
as
a
manifest
and
necessity
test
wherein
the
jury
is
to
be
discharged
only
if
there
is
a
manifest
and
necessity
in
doing
so
in
order
to
preserve
substantial
justice.
the
cases
of
this
court
have
held
that
the
discretion
of
a
trial
court
in
granting
a
mistrial
while
not
closely
scrutinized
certainly
is
not
unlimited.
i
believe
that
the
instant
case
shows
no
extraordinary
circumstance
nor
any
manifest
necessity
for
granting
a
mistrial.
the
trial
court,
after
warning
these
witnesses,
concluded
that
he
would
not
allow
them
to
testify.
whether
this
is
a
legally
defensible
conclusion,
i
believe
at
this
point
is
irrelevant.
after
so
concluding,
the
trial
court
took
a
further
step
which
should
be
distinguished
i
believe
from
the
first
that
is
he
dismissed
the
jury.
certainly
the
second
step
did
not
follow
from
the
first.
trial
court
had
several
discretionary
alternatives
which
he
could
have
followed,
if
he
in
fact
felt
these
witnesses
should
have
a
more
explicit
warning
than
he
had
given
them.
he
could
have
recessed
the
court
overnight
which
would
have
given
ample
opportunity
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose.
he
could
have
called
counsel
to
the
court.
there
are
counsel
available
close
which
he
could
have
requested.
he
did
not
do
this.
he
dismissed
the
jury.
i
believe
the
alternative
which
he
chose
clearly
was
not
dictated
by
any
manifest
necessity.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
would
be
the
logic
of
my
argument.
that
has
been
stated
by
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
that
the
risk
of
judicial
arbitrariness
should
not
be
placed
upon
the
defendant
but
rather
should
be
placed
upon
the
government
in
this
instance.
then
too,
i
believe
the
position
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
is
rather
unique
and
that
the
same
court
that
granted
this
mistrial
or
discharged
the
jury,
some
five
months
later,
on
reviewing
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
granted
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
based
upon
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
would
appear
to
me
that
this
judge
was
in
excellent
position
to
review
his
own
exercise
of
discretion
and
that
in
granting
this
motion,
he
concluded
that
in
his
prior
action
he
had
abused
his
discretion.
abuse
of
this
discretion,
prejudiced
the
defendant
and
for
this
reason
the
action
in
dismissing
the
information
should
be
affirmed.
this
court
has
also
held
in
downum
versus
united
states
that
a
mistrial
declared
in
the
aid
of
prosecution
would
prevent
retrial.
upon
separating
the
action
of
the
trial
judge
into
two
parts,
the
first,
his
opinion
or
conclusion
that
this
witnesses
could
not
testify
and
second,
the
dismissing
of
the
jury,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced.
after
concluding
that
the
witnesses
could
not
testify,
had
the
court
continued
the
trial,
there's
no
question
of
what
a
verdict
of
acquittal
would
have
been
forthcoming
since
these
were
all
of
the
government's
witnesses.
in
both
the
gori
case
and
the
tateo
case
relied
upon
by
the
government,
retrial
was
allowed
after
a
mistrial
in
the
one
case,
after
conviction
in
the
other,
both
times
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
accused.
this
court,
i
believe,
will
rather
heavily
unmet
argument.
the
rights
of
the
accused
were
being
protected.
in
the
instant
case,
the
dismissal
of
the
jury
clearly
was
not
for
the
protection
of
mr.
jorn.
any
possible
beneficiaries
of
this
action
were
the
witnesses
and
of
course
the
government.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
because
after
the
judge
took
the
first
step
of
not
allowing
any
other
witnesses
to
testify
they
had
no
case.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
well,
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
no
he
couldn't.
ultimately
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
perhaps
it's
a
peculiarity
of
that
particular
court,
he
did
order
that
this
witnesses
would
not
be
allowed
to
testify.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
this
is
true,
this
is
true
your
honor.
it
is
the
defendant's
position
that
once
the
jury
was
impaneled,
evidence
was
taken
from
one
witness,
another
witness
was
sworn,
jeopardy
attached
and
pursuant
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
cases
of
this
court,
defendant
cannot
now
be
retried.
either
this
appeal
should
be
dismissed
because
under
section
3731,
if
jeopardy
had
attached,
no
appeal
would
lie
or
the
action
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
facts
as
stated
by
mr.
stone
are
accurate
and
sufficient
for
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
your
honor
i
did,
yes.
the
offset
i
believe
that
this
question
before
the
court
is
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
that
under
section
3731,
the
government
does
not
have
a
right
of
appeal.
in
sisson,
recently
decided
by
this
court
and
mentioned
by
mr.
stone,
this
court
clearly
stated
that
once
jeopardy
has
attached
and
appealed,
it
does
not
lie
for
the
government.
the
government
here
is
arguing
something
that
frankly
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
that
if
the
jeopardy
we
are
talking
about
is
the
jeopardy
in
the
second
trial,
then
no
appeal
would
lie.
but
if
it’s
the
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial,
there
is
an
appeal.
this
it
seems
to
me
does
considerable
violence
to
any
possible
interpretation
of
a
legislative
history
of
that
act.
this
would
make
it
frankly
so
that
the
defendant
by
the
timing
of
this
motion
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
an
appeal.
if
we
have
waited
until
the
jury
had
been
sworn
in
the
second
case
and
then
made
a
motion
based
on
double
jeopardy,
then
the
government
would
admit
there
could
have
been
no
appeal.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
this
is
correct,
unless
they
try
to
prosecute
him
again.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
would
be
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
could
be
mr.
chief
justice
a
corollary
and
it
appears
to
me
however
that
we’re
talking
here
about
the
legislative
intent
in
passing
the
criminal
appeals
act
and
whether
this
could
in
fact
happen.
i
don’t
think
it’s
relevant
to
that
intent.
in
the
instant
case
the
government
has
set
forth
the
facts
relating
to
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial.
if
you
can
call
it
a
mistrial,
there
was
no
formal
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
the
court
and
i
agree
with
the
prosecution,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anyone
once
the
court
began
his
discussions
with
these
witnesses,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
anyone
to
make
any
kind
of
a
motion
before
it
was
all
over,
so
i
believe
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
object.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
over
before
i
even
could
get
in
the
words.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
certainly
do
your
honor.
i
believe
the
judges’
action
was
arbitrary
and
was
not
necessary.
clearly,
the
judge
could
have
done
it
a
different
way
but
i
also
agree
with
what
mr.
justice
white
said,
i
don’t
think
that
makes
any
difference
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
that
would
make
a
difference
to
the
constitutional
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
be
retried
on
a
constitutional
method.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
frankly,
your
honor,
i
haven’t
concerned
myself
with
that
question
and
i
really
couldn’t
answer
it.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes,
it
does.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
right.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that’s
correct.
my
second
point
here
will
be
that
constitutional
double
jeopardy
is
involved
and
he
couldn’t
be
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
believe,
yes
that
you
can
interpret
the
action
of
the
judge
and
i’ll
have
to
agree
with
mr.
stone
that
from
the
beginning
and
one
assumption
practiced
in
this
court,
mr.
judge
ritter’s
court
frequently
has
this
happen.
it
was
apparent
from
the
offset
that
he
does
not
want
this
prosecution
to
continue
and
it
is
my
position
however
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
be
tried
before
this
jury
and
any
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
the
judge
cannot
be
used
on
the
prejudice
of
the
defendant
that
the
government
must
bear
the
risk
of
his
arbitrary.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
i
suppose
that
could
have
been
claimed.
i
will
have
to
agree
candidly
with
mr.
stone,
i
don’t
think
they
would
have
prejudiced
my
client.
after
the
judges,
if
you
break
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes
they
did,
however
more
on
the
part
of
the
witnesses
who
were
going
to
testify.
the
judge
as
i
recall
did
not
really
say
anything
about
the
defendant
but
indicate
what
these
witnesses
had
done
may
subject
them
for
later
prosecution.
if
you
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
double
jeopardy
set
forth
in
downum
and
gori
and
tateo,
i
believe
this
action
by
the
judge
while
you
could
characterize
it
as
not
being
arbitrary
still
was
in
no
way
as
set
forth
in
those
cases
favoring
the
defendant.
if
you
break
the
judges’
action
down
in
its
two
parts
first,
he
felt
that
the
witnesses
should
not
testify
until
they’ve
been
warned
and
he
then
said
“i’m
not
going
to
let
you
testify
until
you
have
been
warned.”
and
then
at
second
part
he
turns
and
dismisses
the
jury.
well
if
you
stopped
after
the
first
part,
clearly
there
were
many
alternatives
available.
this
could
have
been
done
in
an
hour’s
time,
they
could
have
consulted
counsel,
the
trial
could
have
gone
on
but
predisposed
as
the
judge
was
to
refuse
to
allow
them
to
testify
had
the
trial
have
been
going
on.
there
is
no
doubt
but
what
it
would
have
been
a
directed
acquittal
for
the
defendant.
there
were
no
witnesses
and
there
was
no
way
that
the
trial
could
continue
on
the
part
of
the
government
at
that
time
once
he
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
those
witnesses
testify.
so
it
would
be
my
position
then
that
any
solicitude
on
the
part
of
anyone
by
the
judge
was
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
this
i
think
fits
squarely
within
downum
that
the
jury
was
dismissed
in
order
to
allow
the
prosecution
to
more
favorable
opportunity
to
convict.
they
couldn’t
have
convicted
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
well,
in
that
situation
and
i
will
have
to
admit
there
is
not
much
difference
between
the
hypothetical
that
you
post
and
the
instant
case
except
one
witness
did
testify
here.
i
believe
my
position
would
have
to
be
that
the
government
is
powerless.
that
the
risk
of
this
judicial
arbitrariness,
this
defendant
was
entitled
to
be
tried
by
the
jury
impaneled
to
hear
this
case.
and
if
for
some
reason
other
than
his
own
conduct
this
is
prevented,
i
believe
that
the
cases
of
this
court
would
have
to
hold
that
he
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy
and
a
second
prosecution
would
be
twice
in
jeopardy
and
prohibited.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that’s
true
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
believe
on
the
facts
and
the
record
and
subjectively
since
i
was
there
that
there
was
no
way
the
remarks
by
counsel
in
this
case
could
have
foreseeable
precipitated
the
action
that
happened.
i
frankly
did
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
these
witnesses
were
warned
because
i
intended
to
show
that
it
was
they,
and
not
my
client
who
had
committed
the
crime
and
this
was
the
reason
i
felt
they
should
be
warned
of
their
constitutional
rights.
so
while
it
is
open
to
interpretation
that
my
remarks
caused
the
action
of
the
judge,
i
think
that
it
was
not
case.
i
think
the
record
indicates
a
predisposition
of
the
judge
prior
to
the
time
i
made
any
remarks
with
regard
to
this
particular
prosecution.
counsel
for
the
government
has
mentioned
there
was
a
pretrial
and
possibly,
i
mean
it
was
a
preliminary
hearing
and
possibly
this
could
have
been
taken
care
of
earlier.
judge
ritter
did
not
hear
the
preliminary
hearing.
and
the
record
in
the
preliminary
hearing
as
he
stated
was
the
cause
of
dismissing
of
many
of
the
counts
of
the
information
and
it
was
my
--
that
was
where
i
developed
my
feeling
that
it
may
have
been
the
witnesses
rather
than
the
defendant
who
actually
committed
a
crime
and
this
is
why
i
made
the
motion.
i
suppose
it
could
have
been
made
at
an
earlier
time
but
as
a
fact,
it
wasn’t.
going
the
jurisdictional
question,
again,
i
believe
the
legislative
history
of
section
3731,
which
was
discussed
by
this
court
and
system,
while
it
is
ambiguous
in
places,
indicates
that
the
legislature
in
passing
this
criminal
appeals
act
was
very
concerned
that
it
be
limited
strictly
to
its
terms.
there
are
remarks
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
the
--
at
least
some
of
the
senators
debating
this
bill
understood
the
difference
between
the
attachment
of
jeopardy
and
constitutional
double
jeopardy.
i
think
you
must
separate
those
two
questions
because
jeopardy
attaches
and
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
it
attaches
every
time
the
jury
is
formed,
so
that’s
one
question.
the
constitution
comes
into
play
on
a
proposed
retrial,
then
the
motion
is
that
the
defendant
is
being
put
twice
in
jeopardy.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
argue
that
jeopardy.
and
this
has
been
decided
at
least
by
four
members
of
this
court
in
sisson
if
you
--
that
jeopardy
in
section
3731
must
mean
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
not
the
constitutional
standard
because
the
constitution
was
there
and
will
be
there
long
before
the
statute.
there
was
no
reason
for
the
legislature
to
incorporate
a
constitutional
standard
in
the
statute.
it
was
there
and
they
couldn’t
change
what
the
constitution
means
by
double
jeopardy.
i
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
this
question
of
jeopardy
was
--
the
words
put
in
jeopardy
were
placed
in
the
statute
to
strictly
limit
an
appeal
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cases
in
which
there
had
been
no
jury
impaneled.
that
is
the
motion
in
bar
cases
clearly
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
is
the
position
that
four
members
of
this
court
took
in,
in
sisson
and
i
believe
that
holding
prevents
a
retrial
in
this
case
because
jeopardy
had
attached.
and
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
separate
the
jeopardy
in
the
first
trial
and
say
as
government
argues
that
you
can
retry
him
unless
he
waits
until
jeopardy
has
attached
in
the
second
trial
to
make
his
motion.
i
believe
that
the
jurisdictional
question
disposes
of
the
case.
however,
i
also
believe
that
the
defendant
has
been
constitutionally
placed
in
jeopardy
within
the
meaning
of
this
court’s
cases.
specifically
that
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
sisson
is
limited
so
i
don’t
think
it
reads
that
way.
sisson
to
me
seems
to
say
that
once
a
jury
has
been
impaneled,
it
doesn’t
say
whether
a
first
jury
or
second
jury,
the
facts
are
as
you
state
them.
there
was
no
second
jury
there
and
in
fact
there
was
no
second
jury
in
this
case.
but
that
once
jeopardy
has
attached
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
these
legislators
did
not
intend
to
give
the
government
a
right
of
appeal.
i
would
request
that
this
court
dismiss
the
appeal
and
even
if
the
appeal
were
granted,
i
feel
that
under
the
cases
of
this
court
the
defendant
has
been
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
and
neither
the
constitution
cannot
now
be
retried.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
off
hand,
i
don’t
see
any
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
that
appears
from
the
record
to
be
the
case.
however,
five
months
later
when
in
fact
the
case,
the
government
had
the
case
placed
back
on
the
calendar
and
our
motion
was
made,
the
judge
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
double
jeopardy.
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
himself
in
reviewing
his
action
in
the
prior
case
had
determined
that
the
defendant
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy
by
his
action.
now
--
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
yes
and
possibly
could
be
construed
as
having
acquitted
the
defendant.
thank
you.
mr.
denis
r.
morrill
thank
you,
your
honor.
