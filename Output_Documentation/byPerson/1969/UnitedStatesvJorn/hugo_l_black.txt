how
much
was
involved?
justice

then
i
suppose
that
you
are
saying
that
he
actually
could
but
it
wouldn't
be
legal.
justice

l.
black
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
think
this
man
was
put
in
jeopardy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
that
you're
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
now
follow
up
my
first
question.
let's
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
i
thought,
you
will
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
the
judge
instead
of
doing
what
he
did
and
let
the
government
put
on
the
witness
one
by
one.
and
when
the
witnesses
get
through
he
had
excluded
their
testimony
and
said
it's
no
good,
then
would
that
have
been
jeopardy
so
as
to
prevent
another
trial?
and
if
so
why
isn't
they
couldn't
give
an
effect
to
what
he
did
the
same
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
haven't
done
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
there
had
been
no
verdict.
wouldn't
that
be
a
form
of
jeopardy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
almost
acquittal
--
would
it
not
have
been
a
form
of
jeopardy
if
the
judge
had
heard
all
the
evidence
and
simply
not
submitted
when
you
read
the
jury
returned
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
hear
the
bit
deep
form
of
jeopardy
which
sounds
to
me
like
it
isn't
pretty
much
of
jeopardy.that
is
a
judge,
witness
by
witness
he
said,
we're
going
to
let
you
put
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
will
prevent
a
verdict,
except
the
judge
taking
a
bit
in
his
mouth
and
proceeding
to
run
the
trial
and
just
tell
the
jury
that
there's
nothing
for
them
to
handle
before
had
made
that
kind
of
error.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
there
has
been
no
verdict
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
there
have
to
be
a
verdict
or
acquittal
in
order
to
amend
the
plea
of
formal
jeopardy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
always
must
be.
there
are
considerations
bringing
into
play
the
double
jeopardy
clause
which
prevent
retrial
when
the
government
is
responsible
for
a
mistrial
and
in
effect
cheats
the
defendant
of
the
plea
of
formal
jeopardy
he
would
have
had
upon
the
acquittal
which
the
government
prevented.
and
to
that
extent
double
jeopardy
clause
does
prevent
retrial
after
mistrial
at
some
instances.
