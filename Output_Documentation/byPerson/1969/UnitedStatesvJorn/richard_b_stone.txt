mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
criminal
tax
case
which
is
now
and
re-argument
comes
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
utah.
the
case
presents
the
situation
in
which
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
both
defense
counsel
and
the
government
agreed
that
the
trial
court
acted
arbitrarily
and
perhaps
mistakenly
in
granting
a
mistrial.
that
same
judge
some
month’s
later
apparently
recognizing
his
error
in
some
way
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
retry
the
case
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
and
it
is
from
that
decision
that
the
government
now
appeals.
i
would
hope
to
devote
the
bulk
of
my
argument
today
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
but
i
would
like
to
at
the
outset
to
address
myself
very
briefly
before
stating
the
facts
of
this
case
to
the
jurisdictional
aspect
of
this
case,
that
is
to
the
government’s
right
to
appeal
the
trial
judge’s
dismissal
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
under
section
3731
of
title
18
of
united
state
code
which
is
known
as
criminal
appeals
act.
i
imagine
that
the
members
of
this
court
remember
that
on
argument
last
term,
the
court
asked
the
government
counsel
in
effect
how
the
government
could
bring
this
appeal
when
section
3731
allows
the
government
to
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
motion
in
bar
only
“when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.”
and
when
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
had
technically
been
put
in
jeopardy
at
the
first
board
of
trial
in
the
sense
that
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
before
the
trial
was
dismissed.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
and
that’s
precisely
the
point
i’m
about
to
make.
of
course,
at
the
time
of
the
original
argument,
it
was
still
undecided
by
this
court
whether
the
phrase
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
in
section
3731,
meant
jeopardy
literally
or
whether
it
meant
jeopardy
in
the
full
constitutional
sense.
in
other
words,
whether
the
jurisdictional
and
the
merits
question
and
a
case
like
this
would
be
essentially
the
same
question
and
of
course
that
question
was
decided
by
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
term
in
the
sisson
case
which
was
handed
down
subsequent
to
the
original
argument
of
jorn.
now
in
sisson,
this
court
decided
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
forecloses
appeal
from
the
motion
in
bar
granted
after
jeopardy
has
literally
attached.
and
i
think
it
can
be
very
fairly
be
said
that
the
court
in
sisson
placed
considerably
weight
on
the
government’s
very
candid
admission
that
it
had
always
assumed
this
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
government
had
always
assumed
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
restricted
the
government
and
precisely
this
way
and
the
government
had
never
sought
to
appeal
for
motion
in
bar
granted
after
jeopardy
has
attached.
i
think,
however,
that
we
can
say
with
equal
cantor
that
we
have
never
hesitated
to
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
motion
in
bar
in
the
situation
like
that
present
one.
that
is
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
was
placed
in
literal
jeopardy
at
the
first
trial
under
circumstances
allowing
him
constitutionally
to
be
tried
a
second
time.
but
in
which
the
defendant
has
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy
at
the
second
trial.
the
trial
at
which
the
motion
we
are
appealing
from
was
granted.
in
other
words,
we
have
always
read
the
phrase
“not
been
put
in
jeopardy”
in
section
3731
to
refer
to
jeopardy
at
the
trial
at
which
the
motion
under
consideration
was
granted.
and
as
the
chief
justice
just
suggested
to
hold
otherwise
would
mean
that
the
government
could
never
appeal
a
dismissal
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
subsequent
to
a
mistrial
because
a
mistrial
is
usually
granted
after
a
jury
has
been
impaneled
and
literal
jeopardy
has
attached.
and
this
would
be
so
even
though
the
predecessor
statute
on
which
section
3731
was
based
which
i
submit
was
a
much
more
restrictive
statute
in
section
3731
and
evidence
even
a
greater
policy
against
government
appeals
in
criminal
cases
indeed
section
3731,
that
predecessor
statute
allowed
appeals
only
from
special
pleas
in
bar.
and
the
classical
and
practically
the
only
example
of
a
special
plea
in
bar
was
a
plea
of
convict
or
acquit
which
is
the
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
i
think
even
the
most
restrictive
view
of
the
phrase
motion
in
bar
which
was
evidenced
by
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion
in
the
mersky
case
makes
it
clear
that
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
this
was
--
that
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
was
a
motion
in
bar
even
under
the
most
restrictive
definition
and
to
refuse
to
allow
the
government
to
appeal
on
section
3731
grounds
in
this
case
would
be
simply
to
read
convict
or
acquit
double
jeopardy
out
of
the
definition
of
special
plea
in
bar
and
leave
that
phrase
and
the
statute
totally
meaningless
and
as
we
state
on
our
supplemental
brief
on
this
point,
there
are
at
least
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
government
was
allowed
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
determination
of
double
jeopardy.
i’m
referring
to
the
tateo
case
of
377
u.s.
and
the
oppenheimer
case
in
which
there
was
a
jurisdictional
objection
and
to
the
appeal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
now,
i’m
going
to
state
the
facts
on
this
very
brief
record
in
rather
considerable
detail.
i
don’t
think
it
would
take
very
long
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
exactly
what
went
on
in
the
courtroom
prior
to
the
granting
of
a
mistrial.
we’re
in
the
district
of
utah
before
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
judge
ritter.
an
information
is
filed
against
mr.
jorn
who
was
charged
in
25
counts
with
having
prepared
false
and
fraudulent
income
tax
returns
for
others.
specifically,
mr.
jorn
was
charged
with
having
either
invented
or
grossly
exaggerated
deductions
to
which
the
taxpayers
and
mr.
jorn’s
customers
were
not
entitled.
a
case
was
called
to
trial
in
august
27,
1968
and
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn
during
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon,
the
united
states
attorney
indicated
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
he
wish
to
amend
the
25-count
information
and
reduce
it
down
to
11
counts,
all
of
which
involve
the
amounts
varying
roughly
between
about
$200
and
$700.
now
the
court’s
answer
to
the
prosecution
upon
hearing
that
the
indictment
was
--
the
information
was
being
reduced
down
to
11
counts
and
i
quote
now
from
page
34
of
the
record
is,
“maybe
if
we
give
you
a
little
more
time,
you
will
dismiss
some
more.”
this
is
a
whole
bundle
of
two-bit
stuff
that
looks
to
me
like.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
whole
bundle
of
two-bit
stuff
that
looks
to
me
like.
this
is
the
judge
addressing
the
prosecution.
i
had
the
observation
here
that
this
judge
ritter’s
first
remark
to
counsel
on
the
record
and
it
illustrates
what
i
think
and
feel
to
be
described
as
a
consistently
hostile
attitude
towards
this
prosecution.
the
first
witness
in
the
case
was
revenue
agent
who
is
called
simply
to
identify
the
returns
under
consideration.
and
after
immediate
stipulation
that
the
returns
were
in
fact
authentic,
the
revenue
officials
stepped
down
and
the
real
witness
was
called
and
this
witness
who
was
one
of
a
series
of
the
main
government
witnesses
was
one
of
the
taxpayers
for
whom
mr.
jorn
had
allegedly
made
a
fraudulent
return.
as
soon
as
this
witness
took
the
stand,
defense
counsel
mr.
morrill
addressed
the
court
as
follows
and
i’m
now
on
page
40
of
the
record.
in
view
of
the
transcript
in
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
matter,
it
is
my
feeling
that
each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
us
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying
because
i
feel
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
violation
of
the
law.
this
is
defense
counsel’s
suggestion
as
to
the
witnesses
who
are
about
to
testify.
and
the
judge
response
to
that
suggestion
as
follows,
“well,
we
wouldn’t
want
anybody
to
talk
himself
into
a
federal
penitentiary
years.”
so
what
the
court
has
to
say
to
you
is
this
and
i
will
not
read
the
following
pages
of
the
record
in
which
the
judge
very
clearly
and
emphatically,
and
what
i
would
call
the
strongest
possible
terms.
it
advises
the
prospective
witnesses
of
their
right
not
to
testify
for
fear
of
incriminating
themselves
and
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer.
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
them
even
though
they’re
not
criminal
defendants
before
they
testify
in
this
case
involving
another
defendant.
and
incidentally
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
prosecution
had
given
insurances
that
he
would--that
the
government
did
not
plan
to
go
against
the
taxpayers.
the
judge
then
addresses
the
witness
and
say,
this
is
now
in
page
41
of
the
record.
“well,
what
do
you
want
to
do?”
and
the
witness
responds,
“your
honor,
my
wife
and
i
have
had
pointed
out
to
us
that
our
returns
had
information
in
them
that
we
know
is
wrong.
and
we
have
admitted
this
and
i
would
admit
it
further
in
this
court.”
the
judge
responds,
“have
you
talk
to
a
lawyer?”
the
witness
says,
“no,
sir.”
the
court
says,
“i’m
not
going
to
let
you
admit
it
any
further
in
this
court.
that’s
all
there
is
about
that.
the
admissions
you
have
already
made
were
very
likely
made
without
telling
you
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.”
the
court
says,
“what
is
that?”
and
the
witness
says,
“we
were
advised
at
the
time
we
were
first
contacted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.”
and
judge
responds,
“if
you
were,
you’re
the
only
taxpayer
in
the
united
states
that
has
been
so
advised
because
they
do
not
do
that
when
they
first
contact
you.”
and
at
that
point,
the
judge
explains
his
version
of
having
internal
revenue
service
goes
about
intimidating
and
incriminating
prospective
defendants.
now
the
judge
excuses
the
witness
at
this
point
in
terms
to
the
united
states’
attorney
and
say,
“are
all
your
witnesses
in
this
shape?”
and
the
united
state’s
attorney
replies,
“your
honor,
by
the
time
any
of
these
witnesses
were
contacted,
there
was
a
criminal
investigation
not
of
the
witnesses
but
up
of
the
defendant.
it
is
true
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
require
this
morning
until
after
first
meeting
with
the
special
agent,
but
it
is
the
practice
in
this
office.”
they
do
give
them
this
warning.
it’s
not
required
but
they
do
so.
the
judge
then
expresses
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
warning
could
have
been
sufficient,
there’s
more
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
united
states’
attorney.
and
now,
we
are
on
page
43
of
the
record,
and
i’m
about
to
conclude.
the
judge
once
again
expresses
his
view
that
this
case
never
should
have
been
brought
because
the
trivial
amounts
involved,
and
finally
ends
the
colloquy
with
this
statement.
well,
i’ll
tell
you
what’s
going
to
happen
to
this
case.
“ladies
and
gentlemen
it
wouldn’t
be
necessary
for
you
to
attend
the
court
any
further
on
this
matter.”
and
at
that
point
the
judge
dismisses
the
jury.
judge
then
requires
all
the
taxpayers
including
the
witnesses
who
had
been
previously
separated
and
excluded
from
the
courtroom
to
return
to
the
courtroom.
and
we’re
now
in
page
44
of
the
record.
once
again
for
the
better
part
of
three
pages
he
advises
them
with
respect
to
their
right
to
remain
silent,
their
right
not
to
testify
and
his
decision
not
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
until
such
time
that
he
personally
has
had
further
opportunity
to
suggest
to
them
the
un-wisdom
of
putting
themselves
in
danger
of
self-incrimination.
and
finally
the
judge
says,
“so
this
case
is
vacated.
the
setting
is
vacated
this
afternoon
and
it
would
be
calendared
again.
and
before
it
is
calendared
again,
i’m
going
to
have
these
witnesses
in
and
talk
to
them
again
before
i’ll
permit
them
to
testify.”
and
of
course
prior
to
the
impaneling
of
another
jury
and
retrial
case
of
the
case
after
the
sufficient
warning
to
these
witnesses
have
been
given,
the
judge
granted
a
motion
for
the
defense
to
bar
retrial
grants
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
the
record
does
not
show
but
--
whether
there
is
no
further
indication
of
what
happened
to
the
witness
mr.
chief
justice
between
the
time
that
the
first
mistrial
was
declared
and
the
time
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
was
granted.
i
assume
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
terribly
time-consuming
task
to
have
the
witnesses
consult
their
lawyers
and
decide
whether
they
ought
to
testify
at
a
second
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
assume
in
fact
that
it
could
have
really
been
done
by
continuance
of
the
first
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
yes.
the
government
–
well,
the
government
was
prepared
to
go
ahead
at
the
first
trial,
so
it
was
certainly
prepared
to
go
ahead
the
second
trial.
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
i’ve
just
recited
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they’re
basically
two
ways
to
interpret
what
judge
ritter
did
in
declaring
mistrial.
to
begin
with,
i
think
it’s
not
unreasonable
to
contend
that
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial
was
directly
attributable,
a
direct
consequence
of
the
defense’s
request
on
page
40
of
the
record
that
quote,
“each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying.”
now,
i
admit
judge
ritter
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
before
defense
counsel
had
sufficient
opportunity
to
explain
what
he
had
in
mind
with
that
request.
he
didn’t
get
to
elaborate
on
it.
it’s
not
terribly
easy
to
figure
out
what
his
exact
purpose
was.
i
supposed
he
may
have
hoped
simply
that
judge
ritter
would
warn
the
taxpayers
of
their
rights
in
language
sufficiently
strong
that
it
would
inhibit
their
testimony
which
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
defense
counsel’s
client,
jorn.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
it
could
have
been
done
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
not
sure
whether
it
would
--
i’m
not
sure
whether
that
would
not
have
been
appropriate.
he
did
it
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
anyway.
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
inappropriate
sense.
it
wasn’t
--
this
would
not
have
cast
any
particular
problem
with
respect
to
the
defendant
on
the
case.
i
don’t
think
that
the
defendant’s
rights
would
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
judges
warning
of
the
witnesses
that
they
were
conceivably
implicated
the
scheme.
that
was
clearly
going
to
come
out
from
the
testimony
that
was
given
anyway.
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
better,
had
the
judge
met
with
the
witnesses
before
the
jury
was
impaneled.
it
could
have
been
done
just
as
easily
that
way
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
any
sort
of
prejudicial
error
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
judge
do
have
done
it
right
there
trial.
now,
i
suppose
the
defense
counsel
may
in
fact
have
hope
that
a
recess
of
some
sort
would
enable
the
taxpayers
to
consult
with
the
lawyers,
if
they
think
more
about
it,
and
this
would
have
an
additional
inhibiting
effect
in
their
testimony.
or
i
suppose
conceivably
the
defense
counsel
might
have
anticipated
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
that
a
mistrial
would
be
declared.
i
can
imagine
he
really
conceive
that
the
judge
would
then
refuse
to
allow
further
trial
and
grant
a
double
jeopardy
but
that’s
i
guess
not
be
on
the
realm
either.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
he
did
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
all
he
did
was
make
a
request
then
at
that
point
judge
ritter
run
away
with
the
proceedings.
no
one
had
much
of
a
chance
to
make
any
kind
of
motion
from
then
on.
but
it
was
in
any
event,
entirely
in
the
defense’s
interest
that
these
taxpayers
say
as
little
as
possible
and
i
assume
at
least
that
defense
counsel
had
that
in
mind
when
he
requested
that
something
be
done
to
assure
them
of
their
right
not
to
testify.
and
i
think
that
in
that
light,
this
declaration
of
a
mistrial
can
fairly
be
seen
as
simply
a
consequence
albeit
rather
excessive
arbitrary
consequence
of
defense
counsel’s
request.
in
that
sense
we
can
place
this
case
in
line
i
think
with
the
numerous
holdings
of
this
court
were
reiterated
all
through
the
decisions
that
in
this
trial
granted
on
defendant’s
motion,
it
does
not
bar
retrial
and
that
proposition
i
think
is
not
on
dispute
in
any
case
in
which
there
is
no
special
circumstances.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
he
didn’t
and
he
didn’t
acquiesce
in
it
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
mean
to
blame
him
for
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
mean
only
to
assert
that
one
way
to
look
at
this
case
and
i
am
about
to
going
into
alternative
ground.
one
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
to
say
that
the
request
was
granted
--
that
mistrial
was
a
direct
consequence
of
defense
counsel’s
request
that
some
relief
be
granted
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant’s
be
given
some
warning
of
their
right
not
to
testify.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
it’s
unclear
whether
he
would
have
done
it
or
not.
i
suppose
judge
ritter
might
have
done
just
that
anything
in
this
case
but
it’s
still,
the
defense
counsel
had
his
chance
to
get
in
there
first
and
he
did
so.
he
did
in
fact
request
that
something
be
done
about
it
and
what
was
done
was
excessive
but
it
can
be
seen
as
a
logical
consequence
to
[voice
overlap].
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that’s
right.
there
was
incidentally
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case.
it
was
the
result
of
the
preliminary
hearing
justice
marshall
that
the
prosecution
decided
that
some
of
its
witnesses
were
not
--
sufficiently
not
have
sufficient
memories
of
the
events
that
took
place
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
preliminary
hearing
the
14
of
the
25
counts
were
dropped
and
i
think
that
was
ample
time
for
judge
ritter
felt
especially
solicit
as
of
these
witnesses
and
defense
counsel
was
especially
worried
that
there
testimony
might
not
be
inhibited
by
any
warning
that
was
ample
time
at
the
preliminary
hearing
to
get
into
this
matter
at
that
point.
certainly,
a
few
days
delay
would
have
cleared
up
the
whole
problem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
a
pretty
difficult
question
justice
harlan.
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
that’s
a
--
i
think
that
in
fact
the
judge
was
motivated
in
granting
the
mistrial
on
grounds
that
the
witnesses
were
not
prepared
by
his
feelings
that
this
was
a
peewee
prosecution
but
i
think
it
is
probably
a
bit
far
fetched
to
decide
this
case
as
though
he
had
said,
i
am
not
going
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
any
further
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
verdict
of
acquittal
and
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
quite
a
lot
of
--
that
would
have
put
the
proposition
that
the
government
cannot
appeal
that
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
to
its
most
extreme
test
and
i
supposed
technically
there’d
be
quite
a
problem
in
appealing
the
case
though
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
that
was
discussed
i
think
when
we
discussed
this
proposition
at
the
argument
last
year.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
know
what
other
claims
with
respect
to
double
jeopardy
that
would
be.
i
think
if
i
understand
the
chief
justice’s
question
correctly,
i
think
that
if
a
defense
counsel
had
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
these
grounds
that
the
witnesses
should
be
entitled
to
further
warning
of
their
rights
and
if
that
were
the
grounds
which
the
judge
granted
the
mistrial,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
all
of
the
precedents
in
this
court,
no
one
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
defense
counsel
would
adopt
defense
counsel
would
have
disputed
that
he
would
have
no
further
ground
to
double
jeopardy.
i
don’t
know
how
there
could
be
a
waiver
because
i
don’t
know
what
other
grounds
for
asserting
double
jeopardy
that
he
could
have.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
to
actually
call
it
a
--
to
actually
call
it
a
motion,
i
am
a
little
reluctant
to
do
that
since
no
motion
was
made.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
think
this
court
can
equate
it
with
the
motion.
this
court
can,
under
the
rationale
of
those
cases
holding
the
mistrial
granted
that
the
defense’s
motion
does
not
bar
retrial
can
save
that
that
is
also
true
of
a
mistrial
granted
as
a
logical
consequence
of
a
defendant’s
request.
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
go
strain
what
actually
happen
to
say
that
a
motion
was
made
but
we
can
say
that
it
has
the
same
legal
effect
as
a
motion.
i
think
that’s
not
the
only
way.
but
look
at
this
case,
i
think
there
is
an
alternative
ground
in
which
the
government
ought
to
prevail
justice
well.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
the
–
that’s
why
i
discussed
that
before
i
set
the
facts
at
all.
i
don’t
think
if
there’s
any
difference,
whose
motion
it
was
or
what
the
motivations
were.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
the
crucial
fact
is
that
the
motion
which
we
are
appealing
occurred
at
the
--
before
the
trial
at
which
defendant
had
not
been
put
to
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
read
sisson
as
saying
simply
that
that
is
so
in
case
in
which
the
motion
was
granted
at
the
trial
from
which
the
government
is
seeking
appeal.
i
don’t
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
or
the
reasoning
of
sisson
required
that
it
be
extended
to
this
extreme
situation
in
which
the
motion
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
government’s
previous
practice
clearly
did
not
extend
to
that
because
the
tateo
case
and
the
oppenheimer
case
were
examples
to
the
contrary
and
we
stated
in
sisson
we’d
never
done
that
and
then
that
very
time
this
case
was
pending
in
which
we
are
appealing
after
jeopardy
had
attached
at
the
original
trial
and
tateo
and
oppenheimer
were
on
the
books
mr.
justice
white
so
that
i
think
that
our
state
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
isn’t
quite
that
arbitrary.
sometimes
when
jeopardy
has
not
attached
to
the
trial
from
which
the
motion
--
at
which
the
motion
we’re
appealing
was
granted
we
can
appeal
and
it
was
at
the
first
trial
we
cannot.
you
know
what;
one
of
the
problems
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
you
can’t
appeal
the
motion
granted
at
the
trial
at
which
the
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy.
but
we
have
always
thought
that
you
can
appeal
a
motion
granted
at
the
subsequent
trial
in
which
he
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
jeopardy
at
the
prior
trial.
and
that
is
consistent
with
our
practice
and
i
think
nothing
in
the
act
or
this
court’s
decision
in
sisson
dictates
otherwise.
i
want
to
go
briefly
into
the
alternative
ground
we
have
in
this
case.
the
other
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
to
assume
not
that
the
mistrial
was
declared
in
response
to
either
sides
request
of
motion
but
simply
that
the
jury
was
discharge
as
a
result
of
judge
ritter’s
excessively
protective
attitude
toward
the
witnesses
and
the
question
at
this
point
is
whether
the
prosecution
must
fail
as
a
result
of
this
judicial
arbitrariness
even
though
it’s
all
agreed
there
was
no
misconduct
in
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
no
conceivable
effort
on
the
part
of
either
the
prosecution
or
the
trial
judge
to
harass
the
defendant
or
denying
him
his
rights
to
be
tried
before
that
jury.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
even
if
this
is
the
view
taken
of
this
record
that
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
burden
of
judge
ritter’s
arbitrariness
must
fall
on
the
prosecution
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
any
harassment
of
the
defendant.
the
rationale
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
did
not
require
such
a
result.
what
the
court
has
always
done
in
this
mistrial
situation
is
to
apply
a
balancing
test.
it
is
not
directly
controlled
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
is
instead
determined
by
a
balancing
test
in
which
the
defendant’s
rights
are
given
very
liberal
interpretation
but
in
which
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
harassment
of
the
defendant
or
excessively
unfair
aid
to
the
prosecution
through
a
mistrial,
retrial
is
allowed.
and
i
think
that
this
court’s
too
much
recent
decisions
in
the
mistrial
area
illustrate
exactly
how
this
court
has
balanced
its
interest
in
the
downum
case
for
example
decided
at
372
u.s.
which
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
refused
to
allow
retrial
subsequent
to
an
aborted
trial.
the
prosecutor
allowed
the
jury
to
be
sworn
before
the
key
witnesses
had
arrived
and
when
it
became
clear
that
the
witnesses
were
not
going
to
show
up,
the
prosecutor
moved
for
a
mistrial.
in
that
case,
if
retrial
has
been
allowed
it
would
have
unfairly
aided
the
prosecution
improving
a
case
that
it
could
not
have
approved
originally.
but
this
case
i
submit
is
not
like
downum
but
is
instead
on
all
force
with
the
gori
case
decided
by
this
court
at
367
u.s.
in
gori,
the
trial
judge
in
what
was
characterized
by
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
over
eager
concern
for
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
declared
a
mistrial
because
he
feared
the
line
of
questioning
by
the
prosecution
was
about
to
result
in
a
prejudicial
disclosure
of
the
defendants’
prior
convictions.
and
just
as
here
the
defendant
in
that
case
neither
urged
nor
acquiesced
in
the
discharge
of
the
jury
but
the
mistrial
was
the
result
of
judicial
arbitrariness.
and
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
been
harassed,
this
court
refused
to
terminate
the
prosecution
merely
because
the
trial
judge
acted
arbitrarily.
now
i
think
to
have
done
otherwise
in
that
case
or
to
do
otherwise
in
this
case
would
really
hang
on
the
prosecution
pure
element
of
chance
which
is
the
element
of
chance
the
judge
will
make
some
error
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants’
double
jeopardy
rights’
really
are
not
intended
by
anyone
to
be
violated.
and
for
this
several
reasons
i
believe
that
this
court
ought
to
reverse
the
district
judges’
decision
and
allow
the
prosecution
to
proceed
again
within
a
further
file
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
so
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
have
about
two
minutes
left
and
i’ll
be
very
brief.
i
want
to
first
respond
to
justice
brennan’s
suggestion
that
perhaps
this
appeal
might
have
been
appropriate
not
for
this
court
but
to
a
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
as
it
is
in
other
ways
is
a
bit
cryptic
on
this
point.
it
does
say
that
appeal
lies
to
a
court
of
appeals
in
cases
where
it
does
not
lie
to
the
supreme
court.
but
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
afraid
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
understand
that
reading.
in
other
words
that
this
court
would
not
jurisdictionally,
this
court
would
not
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
i
think
i
don’t.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
i
also
wanted
to
respond
to
the
defenses
point.
and
i
think
this
really
that
defense
and
mr.
justice
white
are
both
struck
as
really
the
government
is
as
well
by
the
arbitrary
effect
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
has
in
terms
of
a
motion
which
is
not
based
in
any
way
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
can
be
appealed
from
if
it
is
granted
at
one
time
but
not
before
jeopardy
is
attached,
but
not
five
minutes
later
after
the
jury
has
been
impaneled.
now,
that
is
a
rather
peculiar
distinction
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
makes.
and
one
which
we
have
accepted
but
reluctantly
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
arbitrary
disposition
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
makes
ought
to
be
extended
to
a
situation
where
it
is
even
more
remote
and
more
arbitrary
and
where
we
have
--
we
for
in
our
part
had
never
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
extended.
i
want
to
say
in
that
regard
that
this
court,
i
think
clearly
recognize
both
the
majority
and
justice
white’s
opinion
insist
in
recognize
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
quite
arbitrary
very
cryptic
in
certain
ways
and
indefinite
need
of
modification.
and
i
think
very
much
in
response
to
that
congress
was
--
the
senate
was
motivated
to
pass
the
amendment
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
basically
makes
double
jeopardy
and
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
appeals
issue
are
pretty
issue
the
same
and
which
also
puts
the
vast
majority
of
appealable
cases
where
we
think
they
properly
belong
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
does
not
control
the
disposition
of
this
case
that
the
posture
right
now
is
the
senate
has
passed
the
bill
and
its
conference
in
the
house
there
appears
to
be
no
opposition
to
it
in
the
house.
we
have
had
spend
some
assurance
that
it
would
not
be
controversial.
it
is
attached
as
a
rider
to
a
bill
that
has
some
controversial
provisions
in
it
but
it
is
very
much
hope
that
this
will
be
definitely
law.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
it
does
not
apply
to
pending
appeals
but
i
thought
that
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
it’s
happy
news
to
the
justice
department
and
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
litigants
generally
because
hopefully
soon
we
won’t
have
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
hope
very
much
we
will
get
in
the
lame
duck
session
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
might
well
be,
we
might
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
house
and
senate
version
of
this
bill
are
exactly
the
same.
this
bill
is
not
in
dispute
between
the
house
and
the
senate
because
of
the
lateness
and
the
term
with
which
this
bill
passed
senate
however.
it
was
attached
as
a
rider
to
another
house
bill
of
that
which
there
are
differences.
but,
i
hope
that
we
got
a
month
or
so
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
makes
criminal
appeals,
it
allows
the
government
basically
to
appeal
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
no
--
has
been
no
verdict
of
acquittal
in
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
come
into
play.
it
places
those
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
supreme
court
except
in
those
situations
where
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statue
is
brought
into
play.
and
in
those
situations,
the
appeal
is
by
the
option
of
the
justice
department
either
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
justice
brennan
will
take
that
into
account.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
a
rider
for
the
lea
bill.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
a
rider
to
the
legal
enforcement
bill,
which
it
has
some
untold,
some
controversial
provisions
in
it
and
it
is
going
to
be
--
i
am
told
that
the
top
of
the
agenda
in
the
lame
duck
session.
and
i
suppose
there’s
some
--
always
some
doubt
about
what’s
going
to
happen
at
any
session
especially
in
lame
duck
session
but
we
are
quite
hopeful
at
this
point
that
the
bill
will
be
good
law
varied
within
a
month
or
so
and
certainly
by
the
end
of
this
session
of
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
criminal
tax
case
which
is
now
and
re-argument
comes
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
utah.
the
case
presents
the
situation
in
which
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
both
defense
counsel
and
the
government
agreed
that
the
trial
court
acted
arbitrarily
and
perhaps
mistakenly
in
granting
a
mistrial.
that
same
judge
some
month’s
later
apparently
recognizing
his
error
in
some
way
refused
to
permit
the
government
to
retry
the
case
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
and
it
is
from
that
decision
that
the
government
now
appeals.
i
would
hope
to
devote
the
bulk
of
my
argument
today
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
but
i
would
like
to
at
the
outset
to
address
myself
very
briefly
before
stating
the
facts
of
this
case
to
the
jurisdictional
aspect
of
this
case,
that
is
to
the
government’s
right
to
appeal
the
trial
judge’s
dismissal
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
under
section
3731
of
title
18
of
united
state
code
which
is
known
as
criminal
appeals
act.
i
imagine
that
the
members
of
this
court
remember
that
on
argument
last
term,
the
court
asked
the
government
counsel
in
effect
how
the
government
could
bring
this
appeal
when
section
3731
allows
the
government
to
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
motion
in
bar
only
“when
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy.”
and
when
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
had
technically
been
put
in
jeopardy
at
the
first
board
of
trial
in
the
sense
that
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
before
the
trial
was
dismissed.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right
and
that’s
precisely
the
point
i’m
about
to
make.
of
course,
at
the
time
of
the
original
argument,
it
was
still
undecided
by
this
court
whether
the
phrase
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
in
section
3731,
meant
jeopardy
literally
or
whether
it
meant
jeopardy
in
the
full
constitutional
sense.
in
other
words,
whether
the
jurisdictional
and
the
merits
question
and
a
case
like
this
would
be
essentially
the
same
question
and
of
course
that
question
was
decided
by
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
term
in
the
sisson
case
which
was
handed
down
subsequent
to
the
original
argument
of
jorn.
now
in
sisson,
this
court
decided
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
forecloses
appeal
from
the
motion
in
bar
granted
after
jeopardy
has
literally
attached.
and
i
think
it
can
be
very
fairly
be
said
that
the
court
in
sisson
placed
considerably
weight
on
the
government’s
very
candid
admission
that
it
had
always
assumed
this
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
criminal
appeals
act.
the
government
had
always
assumed
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
restricted
the
government
and
precisely
this
way
and
the
government
had
never
sought
to
appeal
for
motion
in
bar
granted
after
jeopardy
has
attached.
i
think,
however,
that
we
can
say
with
equal
cantor
that
we
have
never
hesitated
to
appeal
from
the
granting
of
a
motion
in
bar
in
the
situation
like
that
present
one.
that
is
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
was
placed
in
literal
jeopardy
at
the
first
trial
under
circumstances
allowing
him
constitutionally
to
be
tried
a
second
time.
but
in
which
the
defendant
has
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy
at
the
second
trial.
the
trial
at
which
the
motion
we
are
appealing
from
was
granted.
in
other
words,
we
have
always
read
the
phrase
“not
been
put
in
jeopardy”
in
section
3731
to
refer
to
jeopardy
at
the
trial
at
which
the
motion
under
consideration
was
granted.
and
as
the
chief
justice
just
suggested
to
hold
otherwise
would
mean
that
the
government
could
never
appeal
a
dismissal
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
subsequent
to
a
mistrial
because
a
mistrial
is
usually
granted
after
a
jury
has
been
impaneled
and
literal
jeopardy
has
attached.
and
this
would
be
so
even
though
the
predecessor
statute
on
which
section
3731
was
based
which
i
submit
was
a
much
more
restrictive
statute
in
section
3731
and
evidence
even
a
greater
policy
against
government
appeals
in
criminal
cases
indeed
section
3731,
that
predecessor
statute
allowed
appeals
only
from
special
pleas
in
bar.
and
the
classical
and
practically
the
only
example
of
a
special
plea
in
bar
was
a
plea
of
convict
or
acquit
which
is
the
plea
of
double
jeopardy.
i
think
even
the
most
restrictive
view
of
the
phrase
motion
in
bar
which
was
evidenced
by
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion
in
the
mersky
case
makes
it
clear
that
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
this
was
--
that
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
was
a
motion
in
bar
even
under
the
most
restrictive
definition
and
to
refuse
to
allow
the
government
to
appeal
on
section
3731
grounds
in
this
case
would
be
simply
to
read
convict
or
acquit
double
jeopardy
out
of
the
definition
of
special
plea
in
bar
and
leave
that
phrase
and
the
statute
totally
meaningless
and
as
we
state
on
our
supplemental
brief
on
this
point,
there
are
at
least
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
government
was
allowed
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
determination
of
double
jeopardy.
i’m
referring
to
the
tateo
case
of
377
u.s.
and
the
oppenheimer
case
in
which
there
was
a
jurisdictional
objection
and
to
the
appeal.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
now,
i’m
going
to
state
the
facts
on
this
very
brief
record
in
rather
considerable
detail.
i
don’t
think
it
would
take
very
long
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
exactly
what
went
on
in
the
courtroom
prior
to
the
granting
of
a
mistrial.
we’re
in
the
district
of
utah
before
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
judge
ritter.
an
information
is
filed
against
mr.
jorn
who
was
charged
in
25
counts
with
having
prepared
false
and
fraudulent
income
tax
returns
for
others.
specifically,
mr.
jorn
was
charged
with
having
either
invented
or
grossly
exaggerated
deductions
to
which
the
taxpayers
and
mr.
jorn’s
customers
were
not
entitled.
a
case
was
called
to
trial
in
august
27,
1968
and
a
jury
was
selected
and
sworn
during
the
morning.
in
the
afternoon,
the
united
states
attorney
indicated
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
he
wish
to
amend
the
25-count
information
and
reduce
it
down
to
11
counts,
all
of
which
involve
the
amounts
varying
roughly
between
about
$200
and
$700.
now
the
court’s
answer
to
the
prosecution
upon
hearing
that
the
indictment
was
--
the
information
was
being
reduced
down
to
11
counts
and
i
quote
now
from
page
34
of
the
record
is,
“maybe
if
we
give
you
a
little
more
time,
you
will
dismiss
some
more.”
this
is
a
whole
bundle
of
two-bit
stuff
that
looks
to
me
like.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
whole
bundle
of
two-bit
stuff
that
looks
to
me
like.
this
is
the
judge
addressing
the
prosecution.
i
had
the
observation
here
that
this
judge
ritter’s
first
remark
to
counsel
on
the
record
and
it
illustrates
what
i
think
and
feel
to
be
described
as
a
consistently
hostile
attitude
towards
this
prosecution.
the
first
witness
in
the
case
was
revenue
agent
who
is
called
simply
to
identify
the
returns
under
consideration.
and
after
immediate
stipulation
that
the
returns
were
in
fact
authentic,
the
revenue
officials
stepped
down
and
the
real
witness
was
called
and
this
witness
who
was
one
of
a
series
of
the
main
government
witnesses
was
one
of
the
taxpayers
for
whom
mr.
jorn
had
allegedly
made
a
fraudulent
return.
as
soon
as
this
witness
took
the
stand,
defense
counsel
mr.
morrill
addressed
the
court
as
follows
and
i’m
now
on
page
40
of
the
record.
in
view
of
the
transcript
in
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
matter,
it
is
my
feeling
that
each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
us
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying
because
i
feel
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
violation
of
the
law.
this
is
defense
counsel’s
suggestion
as
to
the
witnesses
who
are
about
to
testify.
and
the
judge
response
to
that
suggestion
as
follows,
“well,
we
wouldn’t
want
anybody
to
talk
himself
into
a
federal
penitentiary
years.”
so
what
the
court
has
to
say
to
you
is
this
and
i
will
not
read
the
following
pages
of
the
record
in
which
the
judge
very
clearly
and
emphatically,
and
what
i
would
call
the
strongest
possible
terms.
it
advises
the
prospective
witnesses
of
their
right
not
to
testify
for
fear
of
incriminating
themselves
and
of
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer.
their
right
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
them
even
though
they’re
not
criminal
defendants
before
they
testify
in
this
case
involving
another
defendant.
and
incidentally
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
prosecution
had
given
insurances
that
he
would--that
the
government
did
not
plan
to
go
against
the
taxpayers.
the
judge
then
addresses
the
witness
and
say,
this
is
now
in
page
41
of
the
record.
“well,
what
do
you
want
to
do?”
and
the
witness
responds,
“your
honor,
my
wife
and
i
have
had
pointed
out
to
us
that
our
returns
had
information
in
them
that
we
know
is
wrong.
and
we
have
admitted
this
and
i
would
admit
it
further
in
this
court.”
the
judge
responds,
“have
you
talk
to
a
lawyer?”
the
witness
says,
“no,
sir.”
the
court
says,
“i’m
not
going
to
let
you
admit
it
any
further
in
this
court.
that’s
all
there
is
about
that.
the
admissions
you
have
already
made
were
very
likely
made
without
telling
you
what
your
constitutional
rights
are.”
the
court
says,
“what
is
that?”
and
the
witness
says,
“we
were
advised
at
the
time
we
were
first
contacted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.”
and
judge
responds,
“if
you
were,
you’re
the
only
taxpayer
in
the
united
states
that
has
been
so
advised
because
they
do
not
do
that
when
they
first
contact
you.”
and
at
that
point,
the
judge
explains
his
version
of
having
internal
revenue
service
goes
about
intimidating
and
incriminating
prospective
defendants.
now
the
judge
excuses
the
witness
at
this
point
in
terms
to
the
united
states’
attorney
and
say,
“are
all
your
witnesses
in
this
shape?”
and
the
united
state’s
attorney
replies,
“your
honor,
by
the
time
any
of
these
witnesses
were
contacted,
there
was
a
criminal
investigation
not
of
the
witnesses
but
up
of
the
defendant.
it
is
true
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
require
this
morning
until
after
first
meeting
with
the
special
agent,
but
it
is
the
practice
in
this
office.”
they
do
give
them
this
warning.
it’s
not
required
but
they
do
so.
the
judge
then
expresses
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
warning
could
have
been
sufficient,
there’s
more
colloquy
between
the
court
and
the
united
states’
attorney.
and
now,
we
are
on
page
43
of
the
record,
and
i’m
about
to
conclude.
the
judge
once
again
expresses
his
view
that
this
case
never
should
have
been
brought
because
the
trivial
amounts
involved,
and
finally
ends
the
colloquy
with
this
statement.
well,
i’ll
tell
you
what’s
going
to
happen
to
this
case.
“ladies
and
gentlemen
it
wouldn’t
be
necessary
for
you
to
attend
the
court
any
further
on
this
matter.”
and
at
that
point
the
judge
dismisses
the
jury.
judge
then
requires
all
the
taxpayers
including
the
witnesses
who
had
been
previously
separated
and
excluded
from
the
courtroom
to
return
to
the
courtroom.
and
we’re
now
in
page
44
of
the
record.
once
again
for
the
better
part
of
three
pages
he
advises
them
with
respect
to
their
right
to
remain
silent,
their
right
not
to
testify
and
his
decision
not
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
until
such
time
that
he
personally
has
had
further
opportunity
to
suggest
to
them
the
un-wisdom
of
putting
themselves
in
danger
of
self-incrimination.
and
finally
the
judge
says,
“so
this
case
is
vacated.
the
setting
is
vacated
this
afternoon
and
it
would
be
calendared
again.
and
before
it
is
calendared
again,
i’m
going
to
have
these
witnesses
in
and
talk
to
them
again
before
i’ll
permit
them
to
testify.”
and
of
course
prior
to
the
impaneling
of
another
jury
and
retrial
case
of
the
case
after
the
sufficient
warning
to
these
witnesses
have
been
given,
the
judge
granted
a
motion
for
the
defense
to
bar
retrial
grants
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
the
record
does
not
show
but
--
whether
there
is
no
further
indication
of
what
happened
to
the
witness
mr.
chief
justice
between
the
time
that
the
first
mistrial
was
declared
and
the
time
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
was
granted.
i
assume
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
terribly
time-consuming
task
to
have
the
witnesses
consult
their
lawyers
and
decide
whether
they
ought
to
testify
at
a
second
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
assume
in
fact
that
it
could
have
really
been
done
by
continuance
of
the
first
trial.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
yes.
the
government
–
well,
the
government
was
prepared
to
go
ahead
at
the
first
trial,
so
it
was
certainly
prepared
to
go
ahead
the
second
trial.
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
i’ve
just
recited
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they’re
basically
two
ways
to
interpret
what
judge
ritter
did
in
declaring
mistrial.
to
begin
with,
i
think
it’s
not
unreasonable
to
contend
that
the
declaration
of
the
mistrial
was
directly
attributable,
a
direct
consequence
of
the
defense’s
request
on
page
40
of
the
record
that
quote,
“each
of
these
taxpayers
should
be
warned
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
before
testifying.”
now,
i
admit
judge
ritter
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
before
defense
counsel
had
sufficient
opportunity
to
explain
what
he
had
in
mind
with
that
request.
he
didn’t
get
to
elaborate
on
it.
it’s
not
terribly
easy
to
figure
out
what
his
exact
purpose
was.
i
supposed
he
may
have
hoped
simply
that
judge
ritter
would
warn
the
taxpayers
of
their
rights
in
language
sufficiently
strong
that
it
would
inhibit
their
testimony
which
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
defense
counsel’s
client,
jorn.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
oh,
it
could
have
been
done
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i’m
not
sure
whether
it
would
--
i’m
not
sure
whether
that
would
not
have
been
appropriate.
he
did
it
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
anyway.
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
inappropriate
sense.
it
wasn’t
--
this
would
not
have
cast
any
particular
problem
with
respect
to
the
defendant
on
the
case.
i
don’t
think
that
the
defendant’s
rights
would
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
judges
warning
of
the
witnesses
that
they
were
conceivably
implicated
the
scheme.
that
was
clearly
going
to
come
out
from
the
testimony
that
was
given
anyway.
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
better,
had
the
judge
met
with
the
witnesses
before
the
jury
was
impaneled.
it
could
have
been
done
just
as
easily
that
way
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
been
any
sort
of
prejudicial
error
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
judge
do
have
done
it
right
there
trial.
now,
i
suppose
the
defense
counsel
may
in
fact
have
hope
that
a
recess
of
some
sort
would
enable
the
taxpayers
to
consult
with
the
lawyers,
if
they
think
more
about
it,
and
this
would
have
an
additional
inhibiting
effect
in
their
testimony.
or
i
suppose
conceivably
the
defense
counsel
might
have
anticipated
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
that
a
mistrial
would
be
declared.
i
can
imagine
he
really
conceive
that
the
judge
would
then
refuse
to
allow
further
trial
and
grant
a
double
jeopardy
but
that’s
i
guess
not
be
on
the
realm
either.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
he
did
not
mr.
justice
harlan.
all
he
did
was
make
a
request
then
at
that
point
judge
ritter
run
away
with
the
proceedings.
no
one
had
much
of
a
chance
to
make
any
kind
of
motion
from
then
on.
but
it
was
in
any
event,
entirely
in
the
defense’s
interest
that
these
taxpayers
say
as
little
as
possible
and
i
assume
at
least
that
defense
counsel
had
that
in
mind
when
he
requested
that
something
be
done
to
assure
them
of
their
right
not
to
testify.
and
i
think
that
in
that
light,
this
declaration
of
a
mistrial
can
fairly
be
seen
as
simply
a
consequence
albeit
rather
excessive
arbitrary
consequence
of
defense
counsel’s
request.
in
that
sense
we
can
place
this
case
in
line
i
think
with
the
numerous
holdings
of
this
court
were
reiterated
all
through
the
decisions
that
in
this
trial
granted
on
defendant’s
motion,
it
does
not
bar
retrial
and
that
proposition
i
think
is
not
on
dispute
in
any
case
in
which
there
is
no
special
circumstances.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right,
he
didn’t
and
he
didn’t
acquiesce
in
it
but
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
mean
to
blame
him
for
it
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
mean
only
to
assert
that
one
way
to
look
at
this
case
and
i
am
about
to
going
into
alternative
ground.
one
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
to
say
that
the
request
was
granted
--
that
mistrial
was
a
direct
consequence
of
defense
counsel’s
request
that
some
relief
be
granted
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant’s
be
given
some
warning
of
their
right
not
to
testify.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
think
it’s
unclear
whether
he
would
have
done
it
or
not.
i
suppose
judge
ritter
might
have
done
just
that
anything
in
this
case
but
it’s
still,
the
defense
counsel
had
his
chance
to
get
in
there
first
and
he
did
so.
he
did
in
fact
request
that
something
be
done
about
it
and
what
was
done
was
excessive
but
it
can
be
seen
as
a
logical
consequence
to
[voice
overlap].
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that’s
right.
there
was
incidentally
a
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case.
it
was
the
result
of
the
preliminary
hearing
justice
marshall
that
the
prosecution
decided
that
some
of
its
witnesses
were
not
--
sufficiently
not
have
sufficient
memories
of
the
events
that
took
place
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
preliminary
hearing
the
14
of
the
25
counts
were
dropped
and
i
think
that
was
ample
time
for
judge
ritter
felt
especially
solicit
as
of
these
witnesses
and
defense
counsel
was
especially
worried
that
there
testimony
might
not
be
inhibited
by
any
warning
that
was
ample
time
at
the
preliminary
hearing
to
get
into
this
matter
at
that
point.
certainly,
a
few
days
delay
would
have
cleared
up
the
whole
problem.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
a
pretty
difficult
question
justice
harlan.
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
think
that
that’s
a
--
i
think
that
in
fact
the
judge
was
motivated
in
granting
the
mistrial
on
grounds
that
the
witnesses
were
not
prepared
by
his
feelings
that
this
was
a
peewee
prosecution
but
i
think
it
is
probably
a
bit
far
fetched
to
decide
this
case
as
though
he
had
said,
i
am
not
going
to
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
any
further
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
verdict
of
acquittal
and
i
suppose
that
would
have
been
quite
a
lot
of
--
that
would
have
put
the
proposition
that
the
government
cannot
appeal
that
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
to
its
most
extreme
test
and
i
supposed
technically
there’d
be
quite
a
problem
in
appealing
the
case
though
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
that
was
discussed
i
think
when
we
discussed
this
proposition
at
the
argument
last
year.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
don’t
know
what
other
claims
with
respect
to
double
jeopardy
that
would
be.
i
think
if
i
understand
the
chief
justice’s
question
correctly,
i
think
that
if
a
defense
counsel
had
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
these
grounds
that
the
witnesses
should
be
entitled
to
further
warning
of
their
rights
and
if
that
were
the
grounds
which
the
judge
granted
the
mistrial,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
all
of
the
precedents
in
this
court,
no
one
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
defense
counsel
would
adopt
defense
counsel
would
have
disputed
that
he
would
have
no
further
ground
to
double
jeopardy.
i
don’t
know
how
there
could
be
a
waiver
because
i
don’t
know
what
other
grounds
for
asserting
double
jeopardy
that
he
could
have.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well
to
actually
call
it
a
--
to
actually
call
it
a
motion,
i
am
a
little
reluctant
to
do
that
since
no
motion
was
made.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
think
this
court
can
equate
it
with
the
motion.
this
court
can,
under
the
rationale
of
those
cases
holding
the
mistrial
granted
that
the
defense’s
motion
does
not
bar
retrial
can
save
that
that
is
also
true
of
a
mistrial
granted
as
a
logical
consequence
of
a
defendant’s
request.
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
go
strain
what
actually
happen
to
say
that
a
motion
was
made
but
we
can
say
that
it
has
the
same
legal
effect
as
a
motion.
i
think
that’s
not
the
only
way.
but
look
at
this
case,
i
think
there
is
an
alternative
ground
in
which
the
government
ought
to
prevail
justice
well.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
that’s
right.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
the
–
that’s
why
i
discussed
that
before
i
set
the
facts
at
all.
i
don’t
think
if
there’s
any
difference,
whose
motion
it
was
or
what
the
motivations
were.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
the
crucial
fact
is
that
the
motion
which
we
are
appealing
occurred
at
the
--
before
the
trial
at
which
defendant
had
not
been
put
to
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
i
read
sisson
as
saying
simply
that
that
is
so
in
case
in
which
the
motion
was
granted
at
the
trial
from
which
the
government
is
seeking
appeal.
i
don’t
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
or
the
reasoning
of
sisson
required
that
it
be
extended
to
this
extreme
situation
in
which
the
motion
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
government’s
previous
practice
clearly
did
not
extend
to
that
because
the
tateo
case
and
the
oppenheimer
case
were
examples
to
the
contrary
and
we
stated
in
sisson
we’d
never
done
that
and
then
that
very
time
this
case
was
pending
in
which
we
are
appealing
after
jeopardy
had
attached
at
the
original
trial
and
tateo
and
oppenheimer
were
on
the
books
mr.
justice
white
so
that
i
think
that
our
state
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
it
isn’t
quite
that
arbitrary.
sometimes
when
jeopardy
has
not
attached
to
the
trial
from
which
the
motion
--
at
which
the
motion
we’re
appealing
was
granted
we
can
appeal
and
it
was
at
the
first
trial
we
cannot.
you
know
what;
one
of
the
problems
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
you
can’t
appeal
the
motion
granted
at
the
trial
at
which
the
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy.
but
we
have
always
thought
that
you
can
appeal
a
motion
granted
at
the
subsequent
trial
in
which
he
has
not
been
put
in
jeopardy
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
jeopardy
at
the
prior
trial.
and
that
is
consistent
with
our
practice
and
i
think
nothing
in
the
act
or
this
court’s
decision
in
sisson
dictates
otherwise.
i
want
to
go
briefly
into
the
alternative
ground
we
have
in
this
case.
the
other
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
to
assume
not
that
the
mistrial
was
declared
in
response
to
either
sides
request
of
motion
but
simply
that
the
jury
was
discharge
as
a
result
of
judge
ritter’s
excessively
protective
attitude
toward
the
witnesses
and
the
question
at
this
point
is
whether
the
prosecution
must
fail
as
a
result
of
this
judicial
arbitrariness
even
though
it’s
all
agreed
there
was
no
misconduct
in
the
part
of
the
prosecution
and
no
conceivable
effort
on
the
part
of
either
the
prosecution
or
the
trial
judge
to
harass
the
defendant
or
denying
him
his
rights
to
be
tried
before
that
jury.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
even
if
this
is
the
view
taken
of
this
record
that
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
burden
of
judge
ritter’s
arbitrariness
must
fall
on
the
prosecution
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
any
harassment
of
the
defendant.
the
rationale
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
did
not
require
such
a
result.
what
the
court
has
always
done
in
this
mistrial
situation
is
to
apply
a
balancing
test.
it
is
not
directly
controlled
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
is
instead
determined
by
a
balancing
test
in
which
the
defendant’s
rights
are
given
very
liberal
interpretation
but
in
which
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
harassment
of
the
defendant
or
excessively
unfair
aid
to
the
prosecution
through
a
mistrial,
retrial
is
allowed.
and
i
think
that
this
court’s
too
much
recent
decisions
in
the
mistrial
area
illustrate
exactly
how
this
court
has
balanced
its
interest
in
the
downum
case
for
example
decided
at
372
u.s.
which
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
refused
to
allow
retrial
subsequent
to
an
aborted
trial.
the
prosecutor
allowed
the
jury
to
be
sworn
before
the
key
witnesses
had
arrived
and
when
it
became
clear
that
the
witnesses
were
not
going
to
show
up,
the
prosecutor
moved
for
a
mistrial.
in
that
case,
if
retrial
has
been
allowed
it
would
have
unfairly
aided
the
prosecution
improving
a
case
that
it
could
not
have
approved
originally.
but
this
case
i
submit
is
not
like
downum
but
is
instead
on
all
force
with
the
gori
case
decided
by
this
court
at
367
u.s.
in
gori,
the
trial
judge
in
what
was
characterized
by
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
over
eager
concern
for
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
declared
a
mistrial
because
he
feared
the
line
of
questioning
by
the
prosecution
was
about
to
result
in
a
prejudicial
disclosure
of
the
defendants’
prior
convictions.
and
just
as
here
the
defendant
in
that
case
neither
urged
nor
acquiesced
in
the
discharge
of
the
jury
but
the
mistrial
was
the
result
of
judicial
arbitrariness.
and
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
been
harassed,
this
court
refused
to
terminate
the
prosecution
merely
because
the
trial
judge
acted
arbitrarily.
now
i
think
to
have
done
otherwise
in
that
case
or
to
do
otherwise
in
this
case
would
really
hang
on
the
prosecution
pure
element
of
chance
which
is
the
element
of
chance
the
judge
will
make
some
error
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants’
double
jeopardy
rights’
really
are
not
intended
by
anyone
to
be
violated.
and
for
this
several
reasons
i
believe
that
this
court
ought
to
reverse
the
district
judges’
decision
and
allow
the
prosecution
to
proceed
again
within
a
further
file
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
so
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
have
about
two
minutes
left
and
i’ll
be
very
brief.
i
want
to
first
respond
to
justice
brennan’s
suggestion
that
perhaps
this
appeal
might
have
been
appropriate
not
for
this
court
but
to
a
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
as
it
is
in
other
ways
is
a
bit
cryptic
on
this
point.
it
does
say
that
appeal
lies
to
a
court
of
appeals
in
cases
where
it
does
not
lie
to
the
supreme
court.
but
i
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
am
afraid
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
understand
that
reading.
in
other
words
that
this
court
would
not
jurisdictionally,
this
court
would
not
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
i
think
i
don’t.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
but
i
also
wanted
to
respond
to
the
defenses
point.
and
i
think
this
really
that
defense
and
mr.
justice
white
are
both
struck
as
really
the
government
is
as
well
by
the
arbitrary
effect
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
has
in
terms
of
a
motion
which
is
not
based
in
any
way
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
can
be
appealed
from
if
it
is
granted
at
one
time
but
not
before
jeopardy
is
attached,
but
not
five
minutes
later
after
the
jury
has
been
impaneled.
now,
that
is
a
rather
peculiar
distinction
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
makes.
and
one
which
we
have
accepted
but
reluctantly
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
arbitrary
disposition
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
makes
ought
to
be
extended
to
a
situation
where
it
is
even
more
remote
and
more
arbitrary
and
where
we
have
--
we
for
in
our
part
had
never
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
extended.
i
want
to
say
in
that
regard
that
this
court,
i
think
clearly
recognize
both
the
majority
and
justice
white’s
opinion
insist
in
recognize
that
the
criminal
appeals
act
is
quite
arbitrary
very
cryptic
in
certain
ways
and
indefinite
need
of
modification.
and
i
think
very
much
in
response
to
that
congress
was
--
the
senate
was
motivated
to
pass
the
amendment
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
basically
makes
double
jeopardy
and
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
appeals
issue
are
pretty
issue
the
same
and
which
also
puts
the
vast
majority
of
appealable
cases
where
we
think
they
properly
belong
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
does
not
control
the
disposition
of
this
case
that
the
posture
right
now
is
the
senate
has
passed
the
bill
and
its
conference
in
the
house
there
appears
to
be
no
opposition
to
it
in
the
house.
we
have
had
spend
some
assurance
that
it
would
not
be
controversial.
it
is
attached
as
a
rider
to
a
bill
that
has
some
controversial
provisions
in
it
but
it
is
very
much
hope
that
this
will
be
definitely
law.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
no,
it
does
not
apply
to
pending
appeals
but
i
thought
that
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
yes,
it’s
happy
news
to
the
justice
department
and
to
this
court
and
i
think
the
litigants
generally
because
hopefully
soon
we
won’t
have
to
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
i
hope
very
much
we
will
get
in
the
lame
duck
session
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
might
well
be,
we
might
be
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
the
house
and
senate
version
of
this
bill
are
exactly
the
same.
this
bill
is
not
in
dispute
between
the
house
and
the
senate
because
of
the
lateness
and
the
term
with
which
this
bill
passed
senate
however.
it
was
attached
as
a
rider
to
another
house
bill
of
that
which
there
are
differences.
but,
i
hope
that
we
got
a
month
or
so
--
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it
makes
criminal
appeals,
it
allows
the
government
basically
to
appeal
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
no
--
has
been
no
verdict
of
acquittal
in
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
come
into
play.
it
places
those
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
supreme
court
except
in
those
situations
where
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statue
is
brought
into
play.
and
in
those
situations,
the
appeal
is
by
the
option
of
the
justice
department
either
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
well,
justice
brennan
will
take
that
into
account.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
a
rider
for
the
lea
bill.
mr.
richard
b.
stone
it’s
a
rider
to
the
legal
enforcement
bill,
which
it
has
some
untold,
some
controversial
provisions
in
it
and
it
is
going
to
be
--
i
am
told
that
the
top
of
the
agenda
in
the
lame
duck
session.
and
i
suppose
there’s
some
--
always
some
doubt
about
what’s
going
to
happen
at
any
session
especially
in
lame
duck
session
but
we
are
quite
hopeful
at
this
point
that
the
bill
will
be
good
law
varied
within
a
month
or
so
and
certainly
by
the
end
of
this
session
of
the
court.
thank
you.
