any
question
as

whether
or
not
the
time
of
the

stock,
there

what
is
it,
that
statute
really,
this
attribution
provision
really
means
what
it
says
if
by
–-

and
one
lived
in
europe
and
the

lived
in
california,
is
it
supposed
there's
still
be
attribute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
think
children
--
i
mean
minor
children
or
anything
like
that
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
$25,000.00
transaction
would
be
taken
in
the
form
of
a
note?
justice
potter
stewart
on
this
factual
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
he
wouldn't
gotten
involved
either
because
i
think
if
the
condition
was
that
he
put
his
money
for
the
rest
of
the
business.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
at
least
at
the
risk
of
the
business.
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven't
followed
this
part
of
your
argument
mr.
wallace
that
you
say
that
the
attribution
that
section
318,
attribution
provision
do
not
apply
to
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i'm
looking
at
pages
43
and
44
of
the
government's
brief.
justice

stewart
in
which
–-
justice
potter
stewart
but
the,
going
back
to
43
and
44
in
pages
and
then
look
at
318
(b)
on
44,
the
provision
to
which
the
rules
contained
in
subsection
(a)
applies
to
section
302
relating
to
redemption
of
stock,
and
that
it
would
apply
that
you'd
suppose
to
see
the
whole
section?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
inconsistent
i
suppose
with
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
it
should
be
read
as
applying
only
to
those
parts
of
the
section
that
referred
exquisitely
to
ownership
of
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
has
any
court
ever
accepted
this
argument
which
you're
making?
justice
