mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
tax
case
what
we
might
call
a
regular
tax
case,
not
a
criminal
case
nor
a
land
case
as
the
last
two
were
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
basic
factual
situation
is
simple,
the
statutory
provisions
are
somewhat
complex
but
i
think
reduced
to
a
relatively
simple
problem.
the
case
arises
with
respect
to
a
family
corporation
which
was
set
up
in
1945
by
mr.
davis,
the
taxpayer
here
and
his
partner,
mr.
bradley.
at
that
time,
bradley
had
50%
of
the
stock
and
davis
had
25%
and
davis'
wife
had
25%.
they
sought
to
barrow
$95,000.00
from
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
or
a
subsidiary
of
it
but
found
that
they
could
do
so
only
if
the
company
had
more
capital.
bradley
was
unwilling
to
increase
his
investment
and
so
it
was
worked
out
by
davis
acquiring
$25,000.00
in
preferred
stock
from
the
company
for
which
he
paid
cash.
some
years
later,
davis
purchased
bradley's
stock
and
transferred
it
in
equal
shares
to
his
son
and
to
his
daughter.
as
a
result
of
this
transaction,
the
stock
was
held
four
ways
and
davis
owned
25%,
his
wife
25%,
his
son
25%,
and
his
daughter
25%.
and
davis
himself
owned
all
of
the
preferred
stock.
in
june
1963,
the
rfc
loan
was
finally
paid
off
and
thereafter
on
october
1,
1963
pursuant
to
a
corporate
resolution,
mr.
davis
turned
in
his
preferred
stock
and
received
$25,000
from
the
corporation,
and
this
is
the
transaction
which
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
there's
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice,
there
were
adequate
earnings
and
profits
to
cover
this.
the
question
is
whether
under
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
$25,000.00
is
taxable
as
a
dividend
or
whether
it
was
received
in
exchange
for
the
preferred
stock
resulting
in
no
tax,
since
the
amount
received,
$25,000.00
was
the
same
as
mr.
davis'
basis
for
the
preferred
stock.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
construing
a
rather
specific
and
somewhat
intricate
statute.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
tax
avoidance
or
that
mr.
davis
set
up
any
sort
of
scheme
for
artificially
reducing
his
taxes.
the
fact
is
that
he
received
$25,000.00
from
the
corporation
and
that
he
turned
in
his
preferred
stock.
the
question
is
what
the
tax
consequences
of
this
were
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
under
the
applicable
statutory
provisions.
it's
clear
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
where
congress
had
power
under
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
impose
a
tax.
for
that
purpose,
the
basic
fact
is
that
$25,000.00
was
separated
from
the
corporation
and
was
received
by
mr.
davis
to
which
i
may
add
as
indicated
in
my
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
corporation
had
earnings
and
profits
and
at
least
that
amount.
this
is
not
a
case
like
eisner
and
macomber,
the
stock
dividend
case
where
the
taxpayer
received
only
pieces
of
paper
and
ended
with
more
pieces
of
paper
representing
exactly
the
same
interest
that
he
had
before.
here,
the
shareholder
received
cash
and
had
fewer
pieces
of
paper
than
he
had
before
that
receipt,
and
the
question
is
how
the
receipt
of
the
cash
is
to
be
treated
for
tax
purposes.
basic
to
the
consideration
of
that
question
is
the
provision
of
section
318
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
set
out
at
pages
43
and
44
of
the
government's
recovered
brief
insofar
as
it
is
relevant
to
this
question.
this
is
one
of
the
two
key
provisions
in
the
statute
and
i
think
that
i
should
read
it.
section
318
at
the
bottom
of
page
43
of
the
government's
brief.
for
purposes
of
those
provisions
of
this
subchapter
to
which
the
rules
contained
in
this
section
are
expressly
made
applicable
1
(a),
an
individual
shall
be
considered
as
owning
the
stock
owned
directly
or
indirectly
by
or
for
his
spouse
other
than
a
spouse
who
is
divorced
or
under
a
decree
of
separate
maintenance
which
is
not
applicable
here,
and
two,
his
children,
grandchildren
and
parents.
now,
under
this
statute,
mr.
davis
“shall
be
considered”
not
maybe
or
improper
circumstances
but
“shall
be
considered”
as
owning
all
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
every
share,
all
the
common
and
all
the
preferred.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
stewart,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
because
i
think
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
remove
the
questions
of
degree
which
could
be
raised
by
that
kind
of
questions.
it
is
true
that
some
lower
courts
have
said
that
section
318
should
not
be
applied
where
there
is
evidence
of
active
hostility
between
the
parties,
that
is
not
an
issue
here,
there
is
no
trace
of
evidence
of
hostility
here
but
i
would
take
the
ground
that
congress
felt
that
this
was
an
area
which
should
not
be
determined
by
the
facts
in
each
particular
case,
are
they
really
friendly
and
so
on
as
to
which
there
can
be
infinite
variation
but
that
its
language
as
written
should
be
taken
as
written.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i'm
sure
that
that
does
not
apply.
it
covers
parents
too
so
it's
obviously
not
limited
to
minors.
one
can
say
if
he
want
to
but
he
didn't
owned
all
the
stock,
some
was
owned
by
his
wife,
his
son
and
his
daughter,
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
had
said
specifically
that
the
tax
consequences
of
what
was
done
here
shall
be
determined
by
treating
him
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock.
and
for
this
purpose,
i
think
that
those
last
three
words
at
the
very
bottom
on
page
43
shall
be
considered
without
qualification,
are
significant.
no
suggestion
is
made
either
by
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
or
in
the
courts
below
that
the
provision
is
not
valid
and
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
such
a
contention
could
be
successfully
made.
this
is
the
way
the
congress
said
that
tax
consequences
of
this
sort
of
a
payment
out
of
a
corporation
should
be
determined.
so,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
mr.
davis
is
to
be
treated
as
owning
all
of
the
stock
of
the
company
from
which
he
received
$25,000.00.
let
me
point
out
next
that
section
318
(b)
which
is
about
four
inches
below
the
top
of
page
44
and
set
out
on
page
44
of
our
brief
specifically
refers
to
section
302
as
being
one
of
the
provisions
to
which
section
318
applies.
that
is
a
cross
reference
of
provision
but
it
says
for
provisions
to
which
the
rules
contained
in
subsection
(a)
applies
(c)
(1),
section
302
relating
to
redemption
of
stock.
let
us
then
turn
to
section
302.
this
is
a
long
provision
beginning
on
page
39
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
it
out
in
full
there
but
most
of
it,
the
appellee
is
not
applicable
here.
the
relevant
portions
are
relatively
simple
of
section
302
(a),
if
a
corporation
redeems
its
stock
within
the
meaning
of
section
317
(b)
and
if
paragraph
(1),
(2),
(3),
or
(4)
of
subsection
(b)
applies,
such
redemption
shall
be
treated
as
a
distribution
in
part
or
full
payment
in
exchange
for
the
stock.
now,
what
that
means
is
that
if
you
can
bring
yourself
under
paragraph
(1),
(2),
(3),
or
(4),
then
it
will
be
treated
as
a
capital
transaction
and
not
as
a
dividend,
and
the
first
one
of
those
four
paragraphs,
302
(b)
(1),
subsection
(a)
shall
apply
if
the
redemption
is
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
now,
actually
can
refer
to
subsection
(b)
(2),
(3)
and
(4),
only
to
say
that
everyone
agrees
that
they
are
not
applicable.
302
(b)
(4)
relates
to
stock
issued
by
railroad
corporations
and
reorganizations.
302
(b)
(2)
relates
to
a
substantially
disproportionate
redemption
of
stock
and
302
(b)
(3)
relates
to
a
redemptions
which
terminates
the
shareholder's
interest
and
it
is
entirely
agreed
that
(2),
(3),
and
(4)
are
not
applicable
and
this
case
turns
on
the
construction
of
section
302
(b)
(1).
we
may
complete
the
statutory
picture
though
there
is
no
controversy
about
it
in
this
case
by
referring
to
section
301,
which
provides
that
if
section
302
does
not
apply,
and
we
contend
that
it
does
not,
the
distribution
shall
be
treated
as
a
dividend
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
dividend
under
section
316,
which
means
essentially
whether
there
are
earnings
and
profits
and
section
316
says
that
it
is
a
dividend
if
there
are
earnings
and
profits,
the
statutory
path
is,
shall
i
say
disorderly
and
complicated
but
i
think
it
is
relevant,
relatively
clear.
it's
relevant
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
these
statutory
provisions
about
business
purpose
or
about
tax
avoidance.
these
are
simply
a
straight
forward
series
of
provisions
designed
to
say
that
in
certain
circumstances,
a
payment
made
by
a
corporation
to
a
shareholder
is
to
be
treated
and
taxed
as
a
dividend.
as
i've
indicated
when
we
go
through
all
these
statutory
provisions,
we
find
that
the
key
passage,
the
clause
on
which
everything
turns
is
section
302
(b)
(1).
it's
awkwardly
stated
i
agree.
its
meaning
becomes
clearer
i
think
if
we
reverse
the
negatives,
then
it
would
say
subsection
(a)
which
would
treat
it
as
a
capital
transaction
shall
not
apply
if
the
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
now,
what
it
says
is
that
subsection
(a)
shall
apply
if
the
distribution
--
if
the
redemption
is
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
that
puts
it
backwards
i
think
and
to
me
it's
clear
and
i
don't
think
it
alters
the
meaning
of
particle.
if
it
says
that
subsection
(a)
shall
not
apply,
if
the
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
either
way,
the
question
which
we
must
consider
is
whether
this
redemption
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
and
the
statutory
provisions
was
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend,
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
transaction
here
was
in
the
light
of
the
attribution
rules
of
section
318,
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
it
was
the
payment
of
money
out
of
a
corporation
to
the
person
who
under
section
318
is
to
be
treated
as
owning
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
without
any
change
whatever
in
his
proportionate
interest
in
the
corporation
since
he
is
taxed
on
the
basis
that
he
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
before
the
payment,
and
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
after
the
payment.
such
a
payment
by
a
corporation
to
a
shareholder
without
any
change
in
proportion
and
interest
is,
we
submit,
under
many
decisions
of
the
courts
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
section
302
(b)
(1)
is
the
linear
descendant
of
a
provision
which
goes
back
to
1921,
when
it
was
first
enacted
at
that
time,
it
was
applicable
only
to
stock
which
had
been
issued
as
a
stock
dividend
and
it
was
a
part
of
the
aftermath
of
eisner
and
macomber,
the
great
scheme
at
that
time
was
that
you
declared
a
preferred
dividend
on
your
common
stock
and
then
you
immediately
redeem
the
preferred
dividend
and
the
theory
was
that
that
wasn't
taxable
and
the
statute
passed
in
1921
was
designed
to
reach
that
type
of
the
situation.
it
was
soon
found
however
that
it
wasn't
limited
to
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you
could
organize
a
corporation
with
serial
preferred
stock
and
then
redeem
the
preferred
stock
year
by
year
and
seek
to
get
around
it
and
i
make
it,
i
repeat
again,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
tax
avoidance
scheme
whatever
involved
in
this
case.
in
1926,
the
statutory
provision
was
expanded
to
recover
redemptions
without
regard
to
the
origin
of
the
stock,
however,
that
provision
which
became
section
115
(g)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
was
worded
somewhat
differently
than
the
present
provision.
it
made
a
redemption
taxable
as
a
dividend
if
it
was
made
“at
such
time
and
in
such
manner”
as
to
make
the
distribution
and
cancellation
or
redemption
in
whole
or
in
part
essentially
equivalent
to
the
distribution
of
a
taxable
dividend.
it
was
probably
because
of
those
words
“at
such
time
and
in
such
manner”
that
some
of
the
lower
courts
used
concepts
of
business
purpose
and
tax
avoidance
in
construing
that
statute.
they
said,
well
if
there
was
a
legitimate
business
purpose
or
if
there
was
no
scheme
of
tax
avoidance,
then
it
was
not
at
such
time
and
in
such
manner
but
there
are
no
such
words
in
section
302
(b)
(1)
of
the
54
code
which
is
the
provision
now
before
the
court.
we
have
here
the
simple
question
whether
the
payment
was
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
the
taxpayer
wants
to
treat
this
payment
as
if
it
were
payment
of
a
debt.
he
says
he
always
understood
that
it
would
be
paid
off,
his
position
is
made
clear
at
page
3
of
his
brief
in
opposition
in
this
case
from
which
i
read
two
sentences.
here
moreover,
there
was
a
clearly
identifiable
date
as
of
which
the
preferred
stock
was
to
be
redeemed,
the
date
of
payment
in
full
of
the
rfc
debt.
in
this
respect,
the
preferred
stock
was
like
a
subordinated
debt,
but
there
was
no
debt,
there
was
preferred
stock.
this
was
a
payment
with
respect
to
stock
which
under
the
attribution
rules
did
not
in
any
way
affect
the
proportionate
ownership
in
the
corporation
which
for
tax
purposes
in
pursuant
to
the
expressed
provision
of
the
statute
which
represented
congress's
statement
as
to
how
transactions
of
this
kind
should
be
treated
for
tax
purposes.
for
tax
purposes,
his
ownership
was
100%,
both
before
and
after
the
transaction.
nor
could
this
be
treated
as
a
partial
liquidation
of
the
corporation,
for
that
requires
some
contraction
of
the
business
of
the
company.
here,
there
was
no
contraction
of
the
business.
there
was
simply
the
payment
of
$25,000.00
to
the
person
who
by
the
clear
and
expressed
provisions
of
the
taxing
statute
is
to
be
treated
as
the
sole
shareholder
in
the
company.
thus,
business
purpose
is
we
submit
irrelevant.
moreover,
though
there
clearly
was
a
business
purpose
for
issuing
the
preferred
stock,
there
was
no
such
purpose
for
its
redemption
as
the
taxpayer
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
on
page
17
of
the
record,
this
was
surplus
money.
the
transaction
was
carried
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
mr.
davis
and
not
of
the
company.
the
distribution
of
surplus
money
to
the
sole
shareholder
of
a
corporation
is
precisely
the
kind
of
distribution
to
which
the
dividend
rules
of
section
301
and
316
are
designed
to
apply.
surely,
that
would
be
the
result
if
no
stock
had
been
surrendered
but
eisner
and
macomber
teaches
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
pieces
of
paper
representing
the
same
proportion
that
enters
in
the
corporation
is
irrelevant
for
tax
purposes.
here,
the
important
fact
is
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
taxing
statute,
mr.
davis
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
before
the
transaction
and
he
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
after
the
transaction.
the
only
substantial
difference
was
that
he
had
received
$25,000.00
from
the
corporation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
if
he
had
lent
the
money
to
the
company
and
if
the
circumstances
were
such
that
the
note
would
not
be
held
to
be
essentially
an
equity
in
this
month
and
a
subordinated
capital,
it
would
have
made
a
difference?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
this
factual
situation,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
somewhat
difficult
for
the
government
to
contend
that
a
note
for
$25,000.00
was
not
legitimate
debt.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
subordinated
note,
a
note
subordinated
to
the
rfc's
claim.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
he
would
have
got
the,
could
have
got
the
loan
by
making
a
loan
to
the
company.
it
would
not
have
had
as
good
a
balance
sheet
and
would
not
have
been
as
attractive
for
other
creditors,
was
only
needed
to
deal
after
the
rfc
and
if
he
made
it
subordinate
to
all
indebtedness,
then
i
think
the
government
would
surely
have
come
in
and
said
that
this
is
not
a
debt
but
is
a
stock.
when
i
said
that
it
would
have
been
legitimate,
i
was
thinking
of
subordination
only
to
the
rfc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
if
it
was
subordinate
only
to
the
rfc,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
might
have
had
some
difficulty
in
contending
that
this
was
equity
rather
than
a
dead
investment.
it
would
have
had
some
other
consequences.
there
is
--
the
fact
of
course
here
is
that
it
is
not
a
debt
and
was
not
claimed
to
be
a
debt
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
given
the
consequences
of
a
debt
in
that
transaction,
whatever
in
that
situation,
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
if
there
had
in
fact
been
a
note
rather
than
a
stock.
in
the
decision
below,
and
in
other
cases
and
in
the
briefs
here,
there's
talk
about
the
net
effects
test
and
the
strict
net
effects
test
and
the
flexible
net
effects
test
and
i
find
these
phrases
confusing
and
perhaps
question
begging.
my
own
view
is
that
they
are
irrelevant.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
statute
and
the
application
of
the
statute
becomes
unnecessarily
complex
and
confusing
if
resort
--
if
resort
is
made
to
such
terms
in
the
analysis
of
the
problem.
the
basic
and
underlying
situation
here
is
that
congress
has
provided
that
a
person
in
mr.
davis'
situation
is
to
be
treated
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock
for
the
purpose
of
determining
how
he
is
to
be
taxed
on
the
$25,000.00
which
he
undoubtedly
received
from
the
corporation
which
had
earnings
and
profits
and
at
least
that
amount.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
standard
as
necessary
to
determine?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
determine
what
mr.
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
in
this
case,
i
would
say
that
the
standard
is
what
would
have
been
the
case
if
he
had
surrendered
nothing?
if
he
had
simply
owned
stock
at
the
beginning
and
had
received
$25,000.00,
no
one
would
question
that
the
$25,000.00
was
a
dividend.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
gave
up
a
piece
of
paper
not
affecting
his
proportionate
interest
in
the
corporation,
does
not
keep
that
from
being
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock
is
proportionate
interest
and
the
corporation
did
not
change
a
particle
as
a
result
of
the
transaction,
he
owned
it
all
before,
he
owned
it
all
after,
but
when
it
was
completed
he
had
$25,000.00
in
his
own
hands
which
he
didn't
have
before.
we
say
that
that
was
a
dividend.
as
i
have
suggested
in
replying
to
mr.
justice
black,
if
he
in
fact
owned
all
of
the
stock
himself,
there
could
be
no
doubt.
i
suggest
that
the
$25,000.00
was
taxable
to
him
as
a
dividend
since
his
proportionate
interest
was
in
no
way
changed
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
pieces
of
paper
in
no
way
affected
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
the
statute
says
that
in
his
situation,
he
is
to
be
taxed
on
the
basis
that
all
of
the
shares
are
attributed
to
him.
i've
said
that
i
think
that
section
302
(b)
(1)
is
the
key
here,
of
course,
it's
equally
plain
that
section
318
is
important.
if
the
court
says
as
i
think
it
should
that
section
318
means
what
it
says
and
that
congress
intended
it
to
mean
what
it
says
and
intended
not
to
have
individual
factual
inquiries
on
a
general
equitable
basis
in
the
construction
of
318,
then
i
think
that
the
consequence
for
which
we
are
contending
follows.
it
may
be
somewhat
literalistic
but
this
is
an
area
it
seems
to
me
where
the
tax
statute
can
well
be
construed
the
way
it
is
written
in
order
to
both
to
minimize
repeated
detailed
factual
inquiries
into
the
circumstances
of
particular
cases
with
no
standard
set
up
by
congress
and
in
order
to
clarify
the
application
of
the
tax
law.
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
wise
provision
for
congress
to
make,
i
think
experience
shows
that
it
was
necessary
and
useful,
but
it
is
the
provision
that
congress
did
make
and
it
should
be
applied
here.
and
accordingly
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
tax
case
what
we
might
call
a
regular
tax
case,
not
a
criminal
case
nor
a
land
case
as
the
last
two
were
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
basic
factual
situation
is
simple,
the
statutory
provisions
are
somewhat
complex
but
i
think
reduced
to
a
relatively
simple
problem.
the
case
arises
with
respect
to
a
family
corporation
which
was
set
up
in
1945
by
mr.
davis,
the
taxpayer
here
and
his
partner,
mr.
bradley.
at
that
time,
bradley
had
50%
of
the
stock
and
davis
had
25%
and
davis'
wife
had
25%.
they
sought
to
barrow
$95,000.00
from
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
or
a
subsidiary
of
it
but
found
that
they
could
do
so
only
if
the
company
had
more
capital.
bradley
was
unwilling
to
increase
his
investment
and
so
it
was
worked
out
by
davis
acquiring
$25,000.00
in
preferred
stock
from
the
company
for
which
he
paid
cash.
some
years
later,
davis
purchased
bradley's
stock
and
transferred
it
in
equal
shares
to
his
son
and
to
his
daughter.
as
a
result
of
this
transaction,
the
stock
was
held
four
ways
and
davis
owned
25%,
his
wife
25%,
his
son
25%,
and
his
daughter
25%.
and
davis
himself
owned
all
of
the
preferred
stock.
in
june
1963,
the
rfc
loan
was
finally
paid
off
and
thereafter
on
october
1,
1963
pursuant
to
a
corporate
resolution,
mr.
davis
turned
in
his
preferred
stock
and
received
$25,000
from
the
corporation,
and
this
is
the
transaction
which
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
there's
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice,
there
were
adequate
earnings
and
profits
to
cover
this.
the
question
is
whether
under
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
$25,000.00
is
taxable
as
a
dividend
or
whether
it
was
received
in
exchange
for
the
preferred
stock
resulting
in
no
tax,
since
the
amount
received,
$25,000.00
was
the
same
as
mr.
davis'
basis
for
the
preferred
stock.
before
going
further,
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
construing
a
rather
specific
and
somewhat
intricate
statute.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
tax
avoidance
or
that
mr.
davis
set
up
any
sort
of
scheme
for
artificially
reducing
his
taxes.
the
fact
is
that
he
received
$25,000.00
from
the
corporation
and
that
he
turned
in
his
preferred
stock.
the
question
is
what
the
tax
consequences
of
this
were
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
under
the
applicable
statutory
provisions.
it's
clear
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
where
congress
had
power
under
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
impose
a
tax.
for
that
purpose,
the
basic
fact
is
that
$25,000.00
was
separated
from
the
corporation
and
was
received
by
mr.
davis
to
which
i
may
add
as
indicated
in
my
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
corporation
had
earnings
and
profits
and
at
least
that
amount.
this
is
not
a
case
like
eisner
and
macomber,
the
stock
dividend
case
where
the
taxpayer
received
only
pieces
of
paper
and
ended
with
more
pieces
of
paper
representing
exactly
the
same
interest
that
he
had
before.
here,
the
shareholder
received
cash
and
had
fewer
pieces
of
paper
than
he
had
before
that
receipt,
and
the
question
is
how
the
receipt
of
the
cash
is
to
be
treated
for
tax
purposes.
basic
to
the
consideration
of
that
question
is
the
provision
of
section
318
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
set
out
at
pages
43
and
44
of
the
government's
recovered
brief
insofar
as
it
is
relevant
to
this
question.
this
is
one
of
the
two
key
provisions
in
the
statute
and
i
think
that
i
should
read
it.
section
318
at
the
bottom
of
page
43
of
the
government's
brief.
for
purposes
of
those
provisions
of
this
subchapter
to
which
the
rules
contained
in
this
section
are
expressly
made
applicable
1
(a),
an
individual
shall
be
considered
as
owning
the
stock
owned
directly
or
indirectly
by
or
for
his
spouse
other
than
a
spouse
who
is
divorced
or
under
a
decree
of
separate
maintenance
which
is
not
applicable
here,
and
two,
his
children,
grandchildren
and
parents.
now,
under
this
statute,
mr.
davis
“shall
be
considered”
not
maybe
or
improper
circumstances
but
“shall
be
considered”
as
owning
all
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
every
share,
all
the
common
and
all
the
preferred.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
stewart,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice
because
i
think
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
remove
the
questions
of
degree
which
could
be
raised
by
that
kind
of
questions.
it
is
true
that
some
lower
courts
have
said
that
section
318
should
not
be
applied
where
there
is
evidence
of
active
hostility
between
the
parties,
that
is
not
an
issue
here,
there
is
no
trace
of
evidence
of
hostility
here
but
i
would
take
the
ground
that
congress
felt
that
this
was
an
area
which
should
not
be
determined
by
the
facts
in
each
particular
case,
are
they
really
friendly
and
so
on
as
to
which
there
can
be
infinite
variation
but
that
its
language
as
written
should
be
taken
as
written.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i'm
sure
that
that
does
not
apply.
it
covers
parents
too
so
it's
obviously
not
limited
to
minors.
one
can
say
if
he
want
to
but
he
didn't
owned
all
the
stock,
some
was
owned
by
his
wife,
his
son
and
his
daughter,
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
had
said
specifically
that
the
tax
consequences
of
what
was
done
here
shall
be
determined
by
treating
him
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock.
and
for
this
purpose,
i
think
that
those
last
three
words
at
the
very
bottom
on
page
43
shall
be
considered
without
qualification,
are
significant.
no
suggestion
is
made
either
by
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
or
in
the
courts
below
that
the
provision
is
not
valid
and
i
know
of
no
basis
on
which
such
a
contention
could
be
successfully
made.
this
is
the
way
the
congress
said
that
tax
consequences
of
this
sort
of
a
payment
out
of
a
corporation
should
be
determined.
so,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
mr.
davis
is
to
be
treated
as
owning
all
of
the
stock
of
the
company
from
which
he
received
$25,000.00.
let
me
point
out
next
that
section
318
(b)
which
is
about
four
inches
below
the
top
of
page
44
and
set
out
on
page
44
of
our
brief
specifically
refers
to
section
302
as
being
one
of
the
provisions
to
which
section
318
applies.
that
is
a
cross
reference
of
provision
but
it
says
for
provisions
to
which
the
rules
contained
in
subsection
(a)
applies
(c)
(1),
section
302
relating
to
redemption
of
stock.
let
us
then
turn
to
section
302.
this
is
a
long
provision
beginning
on
page
39
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
it
out
in
full
there
but
most
of
it,
the
appellee
is
not
applicable
here.
the
relevant
portions
are
relatively
simple
of
section
302
(a),
if
a
corporation
redeems
its
stock
within
the
meaning
of
section
317
(b)
and
if
paragraph
(1),
(2),
(3),
or
(4)
of
subsection
(b)
applies,
such
redemption
shall
be
treated
as
a
distribution
in
part
or
full
payment
in
exchange
for
the
stock.
now,
what
that
means
is
that
if
you
can
bring
yourself
under
paragraph
(1),
(2),
(3),
or
(4),
then
it
will
be
treated
as
a
capital
transaction
and
not
as
a
dividend,
and
the
first
one
of
those
four
paragraphs,
302
(b)
(1),
subsection
(a)
shall
apply
if
the
redemption
is
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
now,
actually
can
refer
to
subsection
(b)
(2),
(3)
and
(4),
only
to
say
that
everyone
agrees
that
they
are
not
applicable.
302
(b)
(4)
relates
to
stock
issued
by
railroad
corporations
and
reorganizations.
302
(b)
(2)
relates
to
a
substantially
disproportionate
redemption
of
stock
and
302
(b)
(3)
relates
to
a
redemptions
which
terminates
the
shareholder's
interest
and
it
is
entirely
agreed
that
(2),
(3),
and
(4)
are
not
applicable
and
this
case
turns
on
the
construction
of
section
302
(b)
(1).
we
may
complete
the
statutory
picture
though
there
is
no
controversy
about
it
in
this
case
by
referring
to
section
301,
which
provides
that
if
section
302
does
not
apply,
and
we
contend
that
it
does
not,
the
distribution
shall
be
treated
as
a
dividend
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
dividend
under
section
316,
which
means
essentially
whether
there
are
earnings
and
profits
and
section
316
says
that
it
is
a
dividend
if
there
are
earnings
and
profits,
the
statutory
path
is,
shall
i
say
disorderly
and
complicated
but
i
think
it
is
relevant,
relatively
clear.
it's
relevant
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
these
statutory
provisions
about
business
purpose
or
about
tax
avoidance.
these
are
simply
a
straight
forward
series
of
provisions
designed
to
say
that
in
certain
circumstances,
a
payment
made
by
a
corporation
to
a
shareholder
is
to
be
treated
and
taxed
as
a
dividend.
as
i've
indicated
when
we
go
through
all
these
statutory
provisions,
we
find
that
the
key
passage,
the
clause
on
which
everything
turns
is
section
302
(b)
(1).
it's
awkwardly
stated
i
agree.
its
meaning
becomes
clearer
i
think
if
we
reverse
the
negatives,
then
it
would
say
subsection
(a)
which
would
treat
it
as
a
capital
transaction
shall
not
apply
if
the
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
now,
what
it
says
is
that
subsection
(a)
shall
apply
if
the
distribution
--
if
the
redemption
is
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
that
puts
it
backwards
i
think
and
to
me
it's
clear
and
i
don't
think
it
alters
the
meaning
of
particle.
if
it
says
that
subsection
(a)
shall
not
apply,
if
the
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
either
way,
the
question
which
we
must
consider
is
whether
this
redemption
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
and
the
statutory
provisions
was
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend,
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
transaction
here
was
in
the
light
of
the
attribution
rules
of
section
318,
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
it
was
the
payment
of
money
out
of
a
corporation
to
the
person
who
under
section
318
is
to
be
treated
as
owning
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
without
any
change
whatever
in
his
proportionate
interest
in
the
corporation
since
he
is
taxed
on
the
basis
that
he
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
before
the
payment,
and
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
after
the
payment.
such
a
payment
by
a
corporation
to
a
shareholder
without
any
change
in
proportion
and
interest
is,
we
submit,
under
many
decisions
of
the
courts
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
section
302
(b)
(1)
is
the
linear
descendant
of
a
provision
which
goes
back
to
1921,
when
it
was
first
enacted
at
that
time,
it
was
applicable
only
to
stock
which
had
been
issued
as
a
stock
dividend
and
it
was
a
part
of
the
aftermath
of
eisner
and
macomber,
the
great
scheme
at
that
time
was
that
you
declared
a
preferred
dividend
on
your
common
stock
and
then
you
immediately
redeem
the
preferred
dividend
and
the
theory
was
that
that
wasn't
taxable
and
the
statute
passed
in
1921
was
designed
to
reach
that
type
of
the
situation.
it
was
soon
found
however
that
it
wasn't
limited
to
that
kind
of
a
situation,
you
could
organize
a
corporation
with
serial
preferred
stock
and
then
redeem
the
preferred
stock
year
by
year
and
seek
to
get
around
it
and
i
make
it,
i
repeat
again,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
tax
avoidance
scheme
whatever
involved
in
this
case.
in
1926,
the
statutory
provision
was
expanded
to
recover
redemptions
without
regard
to
the
origin
of
the
stock,
however,
that
provision
which
became
section
115
(g)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
was
worded
somewhat
differently
than
the
present
provision.
it
made
a
redemption
taxable
as
a
dividend
if
it
was
made
“at
such
time
and
in
such
manner”
as
to
make
the
distribution
and
cancellation
or
redemption
in
whole
or
in
part
essentially
equivalent
to
the
distribution
of
a
taxable
dividend.
it
was
probably
because
of
those
words
“at
such
time
and
in
such
manner”
that
some
of
the
lower
courts
used
concepts
of
business
purpose
and
tax
avoidance
in
construing
that
statute.
they
said,
well
if
there
was
a
legitimate
business
purpose
or
if
there
was
no
scheme
of
tax
avoidance,
then
it
was
not
at
such
time
and
in
such
manner
but
there
are
no
such
words
in
section
302
(b)
(1)
of
the
54
code
which
is
the
provision
now
before
the
court.
we
have
here
the
simple
question
whether
the
payment
was
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
the
taxpayer
wants
to
treat
this
payment
as
if
it
were
payment
of
a
debt.
he
says
he
always
understood
that
it
would
be
paid
off,
his
position
is
made
clear
at
page
3
of
his
brief
in
opposition
in
this
case
from
which
i
read
two
sentences.
here
moreover,
there
was
a
clearly
identifiable
date
as
of
which
the
preferred
stock
was
to
be
redeemed,
the
date
of
payment
in
full
of
the
rfc
debt.
in
this
respect,
the
preferred
stock
was
like
a
subordinated
debt,
but
there
was
no
debt,
there
was
preferred
stock.
this
was
a
payment
with
respect
to
stock
which
under
the
attribution
rules
did
not
in
any
way
affect
the
proportionate
ownership
in
the
corporation
which
for
tax
purposes
in
pursuant
to
the
expressed
provision
of
the
statute
which
represented
congress's
statement
as
to
how
transactions
of
this
kind
should
be
treated
for
tax
purposes.
for
tax
purposes,
his
ownership
was
100%,
both
before
and
after
the
transaction.
nor
could
this
be
treated
as
a
partial
liquidation
of
the
corporation,
for
that
requires
some
contraction
of
the
business
of
the
company.
here,
there
was
no
contraction
of
the
business.
there
was
simply
the
payment
of
$25,000.00
to
the
person
who
by
the
clear
and
expressed
provisions
of
the
taxing
statute
is
to
be
treated
as
the
sole
shareholder
in
the
company.
thus,
business
purpose
is
we
submit
irrelevant.
moreover,
though
there
clearly
was
a
business
purpose
for
issuing
the
preferred
stock,
there
was
no
such
purpose
for
its
redemption
as
the
taxpayer
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
on
page
17
of
the
record,
this
was
surplus
money.
the
transaction
was
carried
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
mr.
davis
and
not
of
the
company.
the
distribution
of
surplus
money
to
the
sole
shareholder
of
a
corporation
is
precisely
the
kind
of
distribution
to
which
the
dividend
rules
of
section
301
and
316
are
designed
to
apply.
surely,
that
would
be
the
result
if
no
stock
had
been
surrendered
but
eisner
and
macomber
teaches
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
pieces
of
paper
representing
the
same
proportion
that
enters
in
the
corporation
is
irrelevant
for
tax
purposes.
here,
the
important
fact
is
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
taxing
statute,
mr.
davis
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
before
the
transaction
and
he
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
after
the
transaction.
the
only
substantial
difference
was
that
he
had
received
$25,000.00
from
the
corporation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
if
he
had
lent
the
money
to
the
company
and
if
the
circumstances
were
such
that
the
note
would
not
be
held
to
be
essentially
an
equity
in
this
month
and
a
subordinated
capital,
it
would
have
made
a
difference?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
this
factual
situation,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
somewhat
difficult
for
the
government
to
contend
that
a
note
for
$25,000.00
was
not
legitimate
debt.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
a
subordinated
note,
a
note
subordinated
to
the
rfc's
claim.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
he
would
have
got
the,
could
have
got
the
loan
by
making
a
loan
to
the
company.
it
would
not
have
had
as
good
a
balance
sheet
and
would
not
have
been
as
attractive
for
other
creditors,
was
only
needed
to
deal
after
the
rfc
and
if
he
made
it
subordinate
to
all
indebtedness,
then
i
think
the
government
would
surely
have
come
in
and
said
that
this
is
not
a
debt
but
is
a
stock.
when
i
said
that
it
would
have
been
legitimate,
i
was
thinking
of
subordination
only
to
the
rfc.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
if
it
was
subordinate
only
to
the
rfc,
it
seems
to
me
the
government
might
have
had
some
difficulty
in
contending
that
this
was
equity
rather
than
a
dead
investment.
it
would
have
had
some
other
consequences.
there
is
--
the
fact
of
course
here
is
that
it
is
not
a
debt
and
was
not
claimed
to
be
a
debt
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
can
be
given
the
consequences
of
a
debt
in
that
transaction,
whatever
in
that
situation,
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
if
there
had
in
fact
been
a
note
rather
than
a
stock.
in
the
decision
below,
and
in
other
cases
and
in
the
briefs
here,
there's
talk
about
the
net
effects
test
and
the
strict
net
effects
test
and
the
flexible
net
effects
test
and
i
find
these
phrases
confusing
and
perhaps
question
begging.
my
own
view
is
that
they
are
irrelevant.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
statute
and
the
application
of
the
statute
becomes
unnecessarily
complex
and
confusing
if
resort
--
if
resort
is
made
to
such
terms
in
the
analysis
of
the
problem.
the
basic
and
underlying
situation
here
is
that
congress
has
provided
that
a
person
in
mr.
davis'
situation
is
to
be
treated
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock
for
the
purpose
of
determining
how
he
is
to
be
taxed
on
the
$25,000.00
which
he
undoubtedly
received
from
the
corporation
which
had
earnings
and
profits
and
at
least
that
amount.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
standard
as
necessary
to
determine?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
determine
what
mr.
–-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
in
this
case,
i
would
say
that
the
standard
is
what
would
have
been
the
case
if
he
had
surrendered
nothing?
if
he
had
simply
owned
stock
at
the
beginning
and
had
received
$25,000.00,
no
one
would
question
that
the
$25,000.00
was
a
dividend.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
gave
up
a
piece
of
paper
not
affecting
his
proportionate
interest
in
the
corporation,
does
not
keep
that
from
being
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
as
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock
is
proportionate
interest
and
the
corporation
did
not
change
a
particle
as
a
result
of
the
transaction,
he
owned
it
all
before,
he
owned
it
all
after,
but
when
it
was
completed
he
had
$25,000.00
in
his
own
hands
which
he
didn't
have
before.
we
say
that
that
was
a
dividend.
as
i
have
suggested
in
replying
to
mr.
justice
black,
if
he
in
fact
owned
all
of
the
stock
himself,
there
could
be
no
doubt.
i
suggest
that
the
$25,000.00
was
taxable
to
him
as
a
dividend
since
his
proportionate
interest
was
in
no
way
changed
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
pieces
of
paper
in
no
way
affected
the
substance
of
the
transaction
and
the
statute
says
that
in
his
situation,
he
is
to
be
taxed
on
the
basis
that
all
of
the
shares
are
attributed
to
him.
i've
said
that
i
think
that
section
302
(b)
(1)
is
the
key
here,
of
course,
it's
equally
plain
that
section
318
is
important.
if
the
court
says
as
i
think
it
should
that
section
318
means
what
it
says
and
that
congress
intended
it
to
mean
what
it
says
and
intended
not
to
have
individual
factual
inquiries
on
a
general
equitable
basis
in
the
construction
of
318,
then
i
think
that
the
consequence
for
which
we
are
contending
follows.
it
may
be
somewhat
literalistic
but
this
is
an
area
it
seems
to
me
where
the
tax
statute
can
well
be
construed
the
way
it
is
written
in
order
to
both
to
minimize
repeated
detailed
factual
inquiries
into
the
circumstances
of
particular
cases
with
no
standard
set
up
by
congress
and
in
order
to
clarify
the
application
of
the
tax
law.
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
wise
provision
for
congress
to
make,
i
think
experience
shows
that
it
was
necessary
and
useful,
but
it
is
the
provision
that
congress
did
make
and
it
should
be
applied
here.
and
accordingly
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
