and

mr.
small,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
may
have
missed
it
in
the
record
and
parts
of
the
appendix
which
are
here,
but
is
there
an
explanation
for
why
this
could
not
have
been
obtained
for
the
use
of
this
petitioner
by
the
ordinary
courtesies
and
amenities
as
between
and
among
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
don't
--
so
we
have
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
whether
he
made
any
efforts
or
if
so
what
efforts
he
made
to
get
the
transcript
that
had
already
been
certified?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
--
the
california
courts
have
had
the
--
do
they
have
the
power
to
order
the
codefendant
to
surrender
his
copy
of
the
transcript
for
use
by
your
petitioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
--
do
you
know
whether
any
effort
was
made
to
get
them
to
exercise
the
rules
and
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
--
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
is
it
a
substantial
record
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
about
$25
for
the
xerox
equipment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
california
decide
which
of
the
three
or
four
or
five
defendants,
codefendants
gets
the
first
shot
at
the
transcript?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
for
all
we
know
it
may
have
been
made
available
to
all
of
them
and
each
of
them
collectively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
stage
did
you
come
in
to
the
case
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
were
appointed
by
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
that
its
relevant
at
all
and
please
don't
assume
i'm
suggesting
any
criticism
by
the
question,
but
i
wonder
if
you
made
any
effort
to
consider
getting
an
order
to
show
cause
on
the
codefendant
or
other
processes
to
get
that
transcript
before
you
came
all
the
way
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
i
recognize
that.
you're
here
because
we
asked
you
to
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
small.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
murphy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
anyone
ask
the
district
judge
here
to
direct
a
copy
of
the
transcript
be
made
either
from
the
codefendant
or
from
some
other
person
having
custody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
concede
mr.
murphy
that
the
district
judge
had
inherent
power
to
direct
that
a
xerox
copy
or
some
other
kind
of
copy
would
be
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
district
court
judge
at
the
time
of
the
original
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
take
it
in
exactly
the
posture
it
was
in
when
it
appeared
before
the
united
state's
district
judge,
not
the
state
court.
could
the
district
judge
have
said,
“i
want
a
copy
of
this
transcript,
please
get
one
for
me”
and
for
$25
or
$30
at
the
most,
it
could've
been
made.
now,
would
you
agree
or
--
i'm
inquiring
because
i
am
not
sure,
does
the
district
court
have
any
power
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
i
think
we
have
your
argument
on
that
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
(voice
overlap)
mr.
murphy
that
the
state
having
provided
this
for
a
complete
appeal
once
around
that
that's
the
end
of
the
obligation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
thank
you.
you
have
a
few
minutes
left,
i
think
about
ten
minutes
mr.
small.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
since
the
codefendant
presumably
has
it
or
may
have
it
in
his
possession
for
use
for
the
same
purposes,
why
couldn't
the
district
judge
have
issued
such
an
order
to
show
cause
on
that
codefendant
either
at
the
request
of
the
counsel
if
they
had
the
imagination
to
ask
for
it
or
on
his
own
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
this
case
would
not
have
been
engaged
all
the
time,
involve
the
people
all
the
way
to
washington?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
was
there
a
denial
when
such
a
lack
of
imagination
and
enterprise
at
least
as
i
see
it
as
exhibited
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
ask
the
court
to
do
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
he
is
all
the
way
through
the
chain
of
command
to
this
court
and
that
was
a
considerably
greater
enterprise
than
simply
asking
the
district
judge
in
open
court
on
an
oral
motion
to
do
what
i've
just
suggested,
would
you
not
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
directing
no
criticism
or
no
implication
of
at
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hope
it
isn't
exemplary
of
the
lack
of
enterprise
that
i
see
for
my
part
on
this
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
bearing
mind
before
you
answer
there
will
be
of
other
question
i'll
add.
bearing
in
mind
that
if
he
were
an
affluent
man,
he
could
go
out
and
buy
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
advent
of
the
xerox
machine
and
other
related
machines
will
help
solve
this
problem
without
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
you
acted
at
the
appointment
of
the
court
and
you
came
here
at
our
request.
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance
for
the

we
