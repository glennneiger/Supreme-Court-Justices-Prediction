justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
your
brother
counsel
are
--
differ
a
little
bit
as
to
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
he
puts
in
terms
of
this;
that
since
california
does
provide
a
free
transcript
to
every
individually
tried
defendant,
rich
or
poor,
it
is
obligated
under
the
equal
protection
law,
under
the
particular
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
provide
an
individual
free
transcript
to
every
defendant,
rich
or
poor
who
was
tried
jointly?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
only
--
thus
you
can
eat
can
the
defendant
be
tried
jointly
be
equated
and
give
an
equal
protection
with
the
defendant
who
is
tried
individually
and
singly,
that's
the
way
he
posts
the
issue
before
us.
you
on
the
other
hand
say
what
the
issue
in
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
but
rather
is
the
question
of
whether
a
state
is
obligated
under
the
constitution,
i
suppose
now
the
due
process
clause
to
provide
at
a
state
convict's
arbitrary
request,
a
free
transcript
of
that
convict's
trial
even
in
the
absence
of
any
allegations
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
convict
that
any
error
occurred
at
his
trial
that
might
be
subject
to
collateral
attack
which
is
a
much
broader
issue
as
you
correctly
say
and
which
frankly
it
seems
to
me
is
what
was
the
issue
decided
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
you
--
am
i
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
content
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
which
point?
justice
potter
stewart
which
point?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that
point.
justice
potter
stewart
seven
or
eight
years
after
the
affirmance
of
his
conviction
on
direct
appeal
at
which
his
counsel
did
have
access
to
a
transcript,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
excuse
me,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
mr.
small.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
whether
your
basic
claim
is
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
california
to
supply
a
separate
extra
transcript
to
this
man
for
his
direct
appeal
which
took
place
a
good
many
years
ago
or
whether
its
now
incumbent
upon
california
to
supply
to
this
man
at
--
upon
his
mere
request
a
transcript
of
his
trial
that
took
place
many
years
ago
for
the
purpose
of
now
making
a
collateral
attack
on
his
judgment
of
conviction,
which
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
second
is
a
much
--
of
course
a
much
broader
rule
of
law?
justice
potter
stewart
very
understandably
you're
not
arguing
that.
but
what
if
the
--
what
if
five
or
six,
seven
years
ago
he
had
been
given
it
on
appeal
and
then
he
had
lost
it,
where
would
you
be?
justice
potter
stewart
with
all
his
negligence
that
it
just
disappeared,
now,
where
would
you
be
in?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
really
--
its
that
broader
issue
is
it
not
that
the
district
court
seems
to
have
decided
and
that
its
upon
that
broader
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
reversed
the
district
court
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
particular
state
of
california
where
if
this
man
had
been
--
for
everybody
who
was
separately
and
individually,
this
question
would
never
arise
unless
he
lost
the
transcript.
