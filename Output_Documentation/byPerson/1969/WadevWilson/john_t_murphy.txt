mr.
john
t.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
four
facts
stand
out
in
this
particular
case.
first,
petitioner
wade
is
now
an
indigent.
second,
as
a
state
prisoner,
he
is
a
potential
applicant
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts.
third,
he
is
seeking
here
now
a
free
copy
of
his
trial
transcript
for
no
other
reason
than
to
comb
the
records
in
the
hope
or
anticipation
that
he'll
discover
some
trial
error
in
the
record.
and
the
fourth
fact
and
i
think
this
ties
in
with
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
a
--
the
fact
that
we
have
to
emphasize
in
this
proceeding
is
that
california
has
provided
this
indigent
with
a
trial
attorney,
a
daily
transcript
during
the
course
of
is
trial
with
an
appeal,
with
an
attorney
on
appeal
and
has
given
that
attorney
an
access
to
the
trial
transcript
in
the
preparation
over
the
brief
on
appeal.
california
has
provided
all
of
these
services
at
state
expense
to
this
particular
indigent.
now
the
trial
proceedings
and
the
appellate
process
which
i
suppose
you
can
call
the
natural
extension
of
the
trial
proceedings
terminated
in
1961.
now,
since
1961,
this
petitioner
has
made
no
allegation
in
any
court,
state
or
federal
respecting
the
validity
of
his
state
court
conviction.
what's
--
he
is
in
--
involved
in
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
this
was
a
capital
case.
it's
a
first
degree
murder
case.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
compulsory
or
automatic
appeal
because
like
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
not
personal
possession,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
he
had
a
personal
possession
of
the
trial
transcript.
the
record
does
disclose
that
his
attorney
had
access
to
the
record
for
the
preparation
of
the
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
codefendants.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that
is
--
i
can
make
that
representation
of
fact
that
there
was
but
a
single
daily
transcript
appeared.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
let
me
--
before
i
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
let
me
premise
your
question
your
honor.
the
record
that
is
before
this
court
as
it
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
doesn't
have
the
facts
developed.
there
was
never
any
evidentiary
process
either
in
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
courts
to
determine
what
was
distribution
of
the
daily
transcript,
who
had
access
to
it
and
the
full
circumstances
surrounding
the
use
by
appellate
counsel,
the
transcript
during
the
course
of
the
appeal
in
the
preparation
of
the
brief.
we
really
haven't
had
any
evidence
presented
on
that.
if
we
look
at
this
record,
it
would
disclose
that
the
appointed
attorney
on
appeal
borrowed
a
copy
of
the
record
from
the
state
attorney
general
because
of
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
record
from
the
codefendant,
mr.
pollard.
and
that
in
preparing
his
brief
in
the
state
direct
appeal,
he
relied
upon
this
record
and
i
assume
we
can
or
infer
from
this
that
the
record
that
he
did
use
was
the
same
record
that
the
court
had.
it
doesn't
appear
here
that
there
was
any
handicap
because
he
had
to
borrow
the
record
from
the
attorney
general's
office
rather
than
going
over
to
the
prison,
removing
a
record
from
a
prisoner
and
using
that
in
the
course
of
the
appellate
process.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
course
of
the
appellate
process,
there
is
an
enforceable
right
that
each
co-appellant
or
codefendant
would
have
a
--
to
obtain
the
copy
of
the
record,
either
for
the
attorney
to
prepare
the
brief
or
if
the
appellant
is
proceeding
in
pro
per,
for
himself
to
prepare
the
brief.
there
is
an
enforceable
right
during
this
process
that
of
course
and
it
wouldn't
be
otherwise
under
this
court's
decision
in
griffin,
the
man
is
entitled
during
the
direct
appeal,
to
have
access
to
the
trial
record
in
the
preparation
of
the
brief.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
can't
speak
with
any
--
any
more
than
the
general
familiarity.
when
the
attorneys
are
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
appellants,
the
attorneys
would
have
their
interviews
or
discussions
or
conferences
with
the
appellant
and
borrow
the
record
from
the
appellant.
it
would
be
a
mutual
arrangement
made
among
or
between
the
attorneys
who
are
handling
the
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
you
honor,
if
there
was
any
complain,
if
every
appointed
attorney
had
a
complaint
that
a
transcript
was
not
available
to
him
to
prepare
a
brief
on
appeal,
all
the
attorney
would
have
to
do
under
the
rules
of
court
would
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
court
will
take
the
necessary
action
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
to
either
to
reproduce,
say
a
copy
of
the
court's
transcript
for
the
--
whether
the
co-appellant
to
furnish
his
copy
to
the
appellant
who
does
not
have
a
copy.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
in
use
for
his
brief.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
what
the
state
furnishes
is
access
to
the
record.
now,
if
a
defendant
is
tried
separately,
of
course
he
has
a
unique
trial
record
that
is
peculiar
to
his
particular
case.
as
an
incident
or
a
circumstance
of
the
appellate
process,
it
may
develop
that
at
the
termination
of
the
appeal,
after
the
reversal
or
the
affirmation
of
the
criminal
conviction,
he
may
retain
personal
possession
of
the
transcript
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that
during
the
appellate
process
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
state
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
furnish
the
appellate
attorney
or
the
appellant
in
pro
per
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor,
no
case
in
california
nor
is
there
any
federal
case.
let's
put
this
case
in
its
perspective.
petitioner
wade
without
a
transcript
is
really
in
no
different
position
than
any
other
potential
habeas
corpus
applicant
who
does
not
have
a
transcript
for
any
number
of
reasons.
he
may
not
have
a
transcript
because
it
was
lost,
it
was
stolen,
it
was
destroyed,
because
he
appealed
on
a
settled
statement
rather
than
on
a
transcript
or
because
he
never
appealed
at
all.
he
doesn't
have
the
piece
of
property
which
constitutes
the
transcript.
what
he
did
get,
what
california
did
furnish
him
was
a
transcript
for
use
during
the
appellate
process
and
when
that
came
to
an
end,
the
state's
interest
in
whether
or
not
he
continues
to
have
this
document
in
his
cell
or
wherever
he
wants
to
keep
it,
is
that
a
determination
where
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
yes
your
honor.
now
during
an
appellate
process,
whether
the
appeal
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
trial
or
whether
it's
an
appeal
from
a
habeas
corpus
evidentiary
hearing
or
whether
it's
an
appeal
from
a
lower
court
coram
nobis
proceeding,
the
appeal
necessarily
concentrates
on
a
specific
proceeding.
the
state
is
interested
in
satisfying
itself
that
the
proceedings
below
have
been
fairly
conducted
in
an
accordance
with
law,
state
law
and
federal
law
alike.
but
once
the
appellate
process
ends,
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
johnson
versus
avery
the
responsibility
of
presenting
a
claim
of
illegality
in
the
conviction
rests
upon
the
potential
applicant
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
habeas
corpus
is
a
new
proceeding.
we're
starting
something
all
over
again.
it's
broad
in
its
scope
and
its
varied
in
its
reach.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
there
would
be
a
copy
in
the
files
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
physical
transcript
available,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
know
those
facts.
we
really
haven't
had
any
evidentiary
process
to
determine
for
certainty
whether
or
not
this
man
did
have
at
one
time
physical
possession
either
during
the
course
of
the
trial
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor
we
are
involved
here
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor,
we're
involved
here
with
a
very
broad
issue.
now
counsel
for
petitioner
has
attempted
to
narrow
this
down
and
to
paint
the
state
as
being
irresponsible
because
it
will
not
come
up
with
$40
or
$25
to
xerox
a
copy.
we
have
to
look
at
the
holding
of
the
united
states
district
court.
the
united
states
district
court
said
that
an
indigent
prisoner
is
entitled,
free
of
charge
to
his
trial
transcript
to
explore
the
record
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
flaw.
this
was
the
issue
that
was
ruled
upon
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
when
it
reversed
the
district
court.
so,
we're
up
before
this
court
on
a
broader
principle
and
if
we
were
to
furnish,
if
we
were
to
concede
that
the
district
court
were
correct
that
any
habeas
corpus
applicant,
potential,
let
me
emphasize
that
word
potential.
it's
just
not
any
one
who
has
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
this
is
the
potential
applicant
which
was
--
would
be
anyone
in
the
whole
prison
system
and
the
reach
of
habeas
corpus
or
the
vast
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
involved
matters,
they
go
outside
the
trial
record.
the
are
matters
collateral
to
the
trial
proceeding.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
of
copies,
but
under
the
rule
of
court,
there
would
be
an
original
which
would've
gone
to
the
appellate
court
and
there
would've
been
three
copies
because
this
was
a
capital
case,
the
district
attorney
would've
received
the
copy
and
the
attorney
general
would've
received
the
copy.
the
third
copy
would've
gone
to
be
shared
by
the
appellants
during
the
course
of
the
appeal.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
there
should
be
an
original
and
two
copies
somewhere
in
the
state
of
california.
what
we
think
is
before
the
court,
the
problem
before
the
court
is
not
limited
to
this
particular
case.
the
problem
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
when
an
indigent
makes
no
allegation
on
collateral
attack
of
any
error
that
occurred
in
his
trial,
is
the
state
then
responsible
to
turn
over
its
copy
or
the
copy
of
any
other
documents
whether
they
be
police
reports
or
any
other
matters
that
might
be
connected
with
the
criminal
proceedings,
matters
of
physical
evidence
that
might
have
been
produced
at
the
trial,
whether
or
not
the
state
is
then
responsible
to
turn
over
these
documents
because
the
man
wants
to
engage
in
an
exploration
or
fishing
expedition.
we
think
the
state
burden
comes
to
an
end,
that
the
conscience
of
the
state,
that
it
is
satisfied,
that
it
has
given
the
man
due
process
through
a
criminal
trial
in
an
appellate
process,
comes
to
an
end
when
the
affirmation
of
the
--
with
the
affirmation
of
the
decision
on
that
--
on
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
that's
how
i
understand
the
issue
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
i
might
add
one
more
fact
that
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
very
accurate
summary
of
both
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here.
i
like
to
add
one
more
thing.
if
there
were
an
issue
regarding
the
validity
of
the
california
procedure
whereby
co-appellants
or
codefendants
share
a
single
copy
of
the
transcript,
you
would
not
need
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
raise
this
issue.
the
possession
of
a
transcript
would
be
immaterial.
the
issue
could
be
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
content
of
the
transcript
would
be
immaterial.
the
state
courts
in
this
case
and
the
federal
courts
have
never
passed
upon
this
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
of
course
the
petitioner,
you
might
say
would
be
even
in
a
better
position
if
he
didn't
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
if
he
were
raising
this
point.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
but
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
if
you're
raising
the
point
that
there
--
the
--
there
are
some
invidious
discrimination
in
providing
an
individual
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
defendant
with
the
transcript
in
requiring
codefendants
to
share
a
transcript.
you
don't
need
a
transcript
to
reach
this
issue,
then
the
order
of
the
district
court
would
be
meaningless.
the
court
could
have
found
if
it
reached
that
issue
that
this
man
had
been
discriminated
against,
it
would've
set
aside
its
conviction
and
ordered
the
reinstatement
of
the
appellate
process,
this
wasn't
done.
the
decision
that
was
reached
and
arrived
at
by
the
district
court
which
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
this
man
who
alleged
no
error,
who
we
assumed
--
we
have
no
other
course
but
to
assume
that
he
can't
think
of
any
possible
error.
and
here
is
a
man
that
comes
before
the
court
and
is
asking
for
a
transcript
at
state
expense,
in
other
words
for
the
state
to
subsidize
his
exploration
in
the
anticipation
that
maybe
he'll
come
up
with
something
that
he
can
present
to
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
record
discloses
these
alleged
facts.
as
i
said,
there's
no
evidentiary
process
to
get
into
any
certainty,
but
the
record
alleges
these
facts
that
he
asked
the
petitioner,
asked
the
california
court
of
appeal
for
a
copy
of
his
transcript
some
five
or
six
years
after
his
conviction
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal.
he
was
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
if
he
had
the
funds
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
he
was
indigent.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
allegation
is
that
he
was
indigent.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
he
asked
for
a
copy
your
honor,
not
to
see
a
copy,
asked
for
a
copy.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor.
again,
there's
a
--
looking
at
this
case
in
its
broadest
scope,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
provide
any
requesting
indigent
who
is
a
potential
applicant
for
some
form
of
collateral
attack
with
documents
at
state
expense,
we
don't
provide
him
attorney
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
what
harm
would
it
do
your
honor
in
reply
to
--
provide
him
with
an
attorney
or
to
provide
with
a
team
of
investigators
or
provide
him
with
some
experts.
there's
any
number
of
things
that
you
could
not
necessarily
say
would
be
--
would
be
harmful.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
court
would've
made
it
available
to
him
if
he
could
have
arranged
for
the
reproduction
of
the
record,
that's
what
the
facts
of
this
case
disclose.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
murphy
if
the
petitioner
himself
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
if
he
had
had
the
money,
he
could
have
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
he
could
have
had
a
copy
of
the
record,
but
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court,
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
here
is
how
i
would
pose
the
question.
is
the
state
responsible
to
provide
a
record
to
an
indigent
in
his
continuing
efforts
to
search
for
a
possible
error
in
his
trial
or
to
put
in
another
way,
is
the
alleviation
of
any
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
prisoner
about
the
validity
of
his
state
conviction,
so
important,
so
fundamentally
important
that
the
state
must
assume
the
great
financial
burden
far
greater
than
any
burden
it
has
right
now.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
of
providing
a
transcript
for
any
indigent
who
request
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
let
me
answer
the
question
this
way.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
i
--
on
an
administrative
basis,
on
a
legislative
basis,
some
procedure
might
be
devised
which
would
permit
an
incarcerated
prisoner
a
glance
or
a
look
at
his
particular
record.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
does
a
wealthy
prisoner
your
honor
have
any
real
need
for
the
transcript?
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that's
i
think
is
a
basic
question.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that's
right
your
honor.
but
he
--
there's
also
many
other
--
there's
many
other
things
that
he
can't
have
because
he
can't
pay
for
it.
he
can't
have
an
attorney,
he
can't
have
experts,
he
can't
have
investigators
during
the
course
of
his
incarceration
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
upon
a
mere
request
for
these
services,
he
is
entitled
to
it.
now,
let
me
emphasize
one
more
thing.
we
don't
have
an
absolute
final
foreclosure
or
preclusion
of
this
inmate
from
access
to
the
record,
nothing
is
final
here.
all
we're
asking
is
that
this
potential
applicant
come
forward
and
state
to
some
court
on
apparently
meritorious
ground
why
his
conviction
was
invalid
or
why
his
custody
is
illegal,
that's
all
we're
asking.
so
we
have
a
balance,
we
had
a
great
financial
burden
upon
the
state
to
provide
transcripts
to
indigent
and
on
the
other
side,
a
rather
minimal
requirement
that
the
man
tell
the
court,
apprise
the
court
that
he
is
not
engaged
in
a
mere
exploratory
fishing
expedition
in
the
hope
that
he
is
going
to
find
some
error
and
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
if
he
had
--
if
the
petitioner
had
come
forward
and
alleged
some
trial
error,
if
he
had
come
forth
--
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
but
that
the
district
court
judge
could've
required
the
state
to
produce
the
trial
transcript.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
district
court
in
--
under
those
circumstances
would
be
on
a
fishing
expedition
of
its
own.
i
think
in
order
to
get
a
justiciable
issue
before
the
district
court,
there
has
to
be
some
allegation
of
error
in
the
trial.
now,
if
this
petitioner
had
alleged
that
his
attorney
never
discussed
defenses
with
him,
that
there
was
facts
outside
the
record
that
affected
something
that
occurred
during
the
trial,
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
then
for
the
trial
transcript
to
resolve
that.
all
we're
asking
in
this
case
is
to
alleviate
--
not
to
alleviate
because
we
don't
have
the
burden
yet,
but
they
asked
this
court
to
--
not
to
impose
upon
the
states
the
burden
of
financing
the
indigent
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
continuing
efforts
once
the
state
has
satisfied
itself
that
the
man
has
been
validly
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
four
facts
stand
out
in
this
particular
case.
first,
petitioner
wade
is
now
an
indigent.
second,
as
a
state
prisoner,
he
is
a
potential
applicant
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts.
third,
he
is
seeking
here
now
a
free
copy
of
his
trial
transcript
for
no
other
reason
than
to
comb
the
records
in
the
hope
or
anticipation
that
he'll
discover
some
trial
error
in
the
record.
and
the
fourth
fact
and
i
think
this
ties
in
with
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
a
--
the
fact
that
we
have
to
emphasize
in
this
proceeding
is
that
california
has
provided
this
indigent
with
a
trial
attorney,
a
daily
transcript
during
the
course
of
is
trial
with
an
appeal,
with
an
attorney
on
appeal
and
has
given
that
attorney
an
access
to
the
trial
transcript
in
the
preparation
over
the
brief
on
appeal.
california
has
provided
all
of
these
services
at
state
expense
to
this
particular
indigent.
now
the
trial
proceedings
and
the
appellate
process
which
i
suppose
you
can
call
the
natural
extension
of
the
trial
proceedings
terminated
in
1961.
now,
since
1961,
this
petitioner
has
made
no
allegation
in
any
court,
state
or
federal
respecting
the
validity
of
his
state
court
conviction.
what's
--
he
is
in
--
involved
in
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
this
was
a
capital
case.
it's
a
first
degree
murder
case.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
compulsory
or
automatic
appeal
because
like
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
not
personal
possession,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that
he
had
a
personal
possession
of
the
trial
transcript.
the
record
does
disclose
that
his
attorney
had
access
to
the
record
for
the
preparation
of
the
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
codefendants.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that
is
--
i
can
make
that
representation
of
fact
that
there
was
but
a
single
daily
transcript
appeared.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
let
me
--
before
i
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
let
me
premise
your
question
your
honor.
the
record
that
is
before
this
court
as
it
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
doesn't
have
the
facts
developed.
there
was
never
any
evidentiary
process
either
in
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
courts
to
determine
what
was
distribution
of
the
daily
transcript,
who
had
access
to
it
and
the
full
circumstances
surrounding
the
use
by
appellate
counsel,
the
transcript
during
the
course
of
the
appeal
in
the
preparation
of
the
brief.
we
really
haven't
had
any
evidence
presented
on
that.
if
we
look
at
this
record,
it
would
disclose
that
the
appointed
attorney
on
appeal
borrowed
a
copy
of
the
record
from
the
state
attorney
general
because
of
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
record
from
the
codefendant,
mr.
pollard.
and
that
in
preparing
his
brief
in
the
state
direct
appeal,
he
relied
upon
this
record
and
i
assume
we
can
or
infer
from
this
that
the
record
that
he
did
use
was
the
same
record
that
the
court
had.
it
doesn't
appear
here
that
there
was
any
handicap
because
he
had
to
borrow
the
record
from
the
attorney
general's
office
rather
than
going
over
to
the
prison,
removing
a
record
from
a
prisoner
and
using
that
in
the
course
of
the
appellate
process.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
during
the
course
of
the
appellate
process,
there
is
an
enforceable
right
that
each
co-appellant
or
codefendant
would
have
a
--
to
obtain
the
copy
of
the
record,
either
for
the
attorney
to
prepare
the
brief
or
if
the
appellant
is
proceeding
in
pro
per,
for
himself
to
prepare
the
brief.
there
is
an
enforceable
right
during
this
process
that
of
course
and
it
wouldn't
be
otherwise
under
this
court's
decision
in
griffin,
the
man
is
entitled
during
the
direct
appeal,
to
have
access
to
the
trial
record
in
the
preparation
of
the
brief.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
can't
speak
with
any
--
any
more
than
the
general
familiarity.
when
the
attorneys
are
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
appellants,
the
attorneys
would
have
their
interviews
or
discussions
or
conferences
with
the
appellant
and
borrow
the
record
from
the
appellant.
it
would
be
a
mutual
arrangement
made
among
or
between
the
attorneys
who
are
handling
the
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
you
honor,
if
there
was
any
complain,
if
every
appointed
attorney
had
a
complaint
that
a
transcript
was
not
available
to
him
to
prepare
a
brief
on
appeal,
all
the
attorney
would
have
to
do
under
the
rules
of
court
would
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
court
will
take
the
necessary
action
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
to
either
to
reproduce,
say
a
copy
of
the
court's
transcript
for
the
--
whether
the
co-appellant
to
furnish
his
copy
to
the
appellant
who
does
not
have
a
copy.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
in
use
for
his
brief.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
what
the
state
furnishes
is
access
to
the
record.
now,
if
a
defendant
is
tried
separately,
of
course
he
has
a
unique
trial
record
that
is
peculiar
to
his
particular
case.
as
an
incident
or
a
circumstance
of
the
appellate
process,
it
may
develop
that
at
the
termination
of
the
appeal,
after
the
reversal
or
the
affirmation
of
the
criminal
conviction,
he
may
retain
personal
possession
of
the
transcript
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that
during
the
appellate
process
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
state
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
furnish
the
appellate
attorney
or
the
appellant
in
pro
per
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor,
no
case
in
california
nor
is
there
any
federal
case.
let's
put
this
case
in
its
perspective.
petitioner
wade
without
a
transcript
is
really
in
no
different
position
than
any
other
potential
habeas
corpus
applicant
who
does
not
have
a
transcript
for
any
number
of
reasons.
he
may
not
have
a
transcript
because
it
was
lost,
it
was
stolen,
it
was
destroyed,
because
he
appealed
on
a
settled
statement
rather
than
on
a
transcript
or
because
he
never
appealed
at
all.
he
doesn't
have
the
piece
of
property
which
constitutes
the
transcript.
what
he
did
get,
what
california
did
furnish
him
was
a
transcript
for
use
during
the
appellate
process
and
when
that
came
to
an
end,
the
state's
interest
in
whether
or
not
he
continues
to
have
this
document
in
his
cell
or
wherever
he
wants
to
keep
it,
is
that
a
determination
where
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
yes
your
honor.
now
during
an
appellate
process,
whether
the
appeal
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
trial
or
whether
it's
an
appeal
from
a
habeas
corpus
evidentiary
hearing
or
whether
it's
an
appeal
from
a
lower
court
coram
nobis
proceeding,
the
appeal
necessarily
concentrates
on
a
specific
proceeding.
the
state
is
interested
in
satisfying
itself
that
the
proceedings
below
have
been
fairly
conducted
in
an
accordance
with
law,
state
law
and
federal
law
alike.
but
once
the
appellate
process
ends,
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
johnson
versus
avery
the
responsibility
of
presenting
a
claim
of
illegality
in
the
conviction
rests
upon
the
potential
applicant
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
habeas
corpus
is
a
new
proceeding.
we're
starting
something
all
over
again.
it's
broad
in
its
scope
and
its
varied
in
its
reach.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
there
would
be
a
copy
in
the
files
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
physical
transcript
available,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
know
those
facts.
we
really
haven't
had
any
evidentiary
process
to
determine
for
certainty
whether
or
not
this
man
did
have
at
one
time
physical
possession
either
during
the
course
of
the
trial
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor
we
are
involved
here
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor,
we're
involved
here
with
a
very
broad
issue.
now
counsel
for
petitioner
has
attempted
to
narrow
this
down
and
to
paint
the
state
as
being
irresponsible
because
it
will
not
come
up
with
$40
or
$25
to
xerox
a
copy.
we
have
to
look
at
the
holding
of
the
united
states
district
court.
the
united
states
district
court
said
that
an
indigent
prisoner
is
entitled,
free
of
charge
to
his
trial
transcript
to
explore
the
record
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
flaw.
this
was
the
issue
that
was
ruled
upon
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
when
it
reversed
the
district
court.
so,
we're
up
before
this
court
on
a
broader
principle
and
if
we
were
to
furnish,
if
we
were
to
concede
that
the
district
court
were
correct
that
any
habeas
corpus
applicant,
potential,
let
me
emphasize
that
word
potential.
it's
just
not
any
one
who
has
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
this
is
the
potential
applicant
which
was
--
would
be
anyone
in
the
whole
prison
system
and
the
reach
of
habeas
corpus
or
the
vast
number
of
habeas
corpus
cases
involved
matters,
they
go
outside
the
trial
record.
the
are
matters
collateral
to
the
trial
proceeding.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
of
copies,
but
under
the
rule
of
court,
there
would
be
an
original
which
would've
gone
to
the
appellate
court
and
there
would've
been
three
copies
because
this
was
a
capital
case,
the
district
attorney
would've
received
the
copy
and
the
attorney
general
would've
received
the
copy.
the
third
copy
would've
gone
to
be
shared
by
the
appellants
during
the
course
of
the
appeal.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
there
should
be
an
original
and
two
copies
somewhere
in
the
state
of
california.
what
we
think
is
before
the
court,
the
problem
before
the
court
is
not
limited
to
this
particular
case.
the
problem
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
when
an
indigent
makes
no
allegation
on
collateral
attack
of
any
error
that
occurred
in
his
trial,
is
the
state
then
responsible
to
turn
over
its
copy
or
the
copy
of
any
other
documents
whether
they
be
police
reports
or
any
other
matters
that
might
be
connected
with
the
criminal
proceedings,
matters
of
physical
evidence
that
might
have
been
produced
at
the
trial,
whether
or
not
the
state
is
then
responsible
to
turn
over
these
documents
because
the
man
wants
to
engage
in
an
exploration
or
fishing
expedition.
we
think
the
state
burden
comes
to
an
end,
that
the
conscience
of
the
state,
that
it
is
satisfied,
that
it
has
given
the
man
due
process
through
a
criminal
trial
in
an
appellate
process,
comes
to
an
end
when
the
affirmation
of
the
--
with
the
affirmation
of
the
decision
on
that
--
on
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
that's
how
i
understand
the
issue
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
i
might
add
one
more
fact
that
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
very
accurate
summary
of
both
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here.
i
like
to
add
one
more
thing.
if
there
were
an
issue
regarding
the
validity
of
the
california
procedure
whereby
co-appellants
or
codefendants
share
a
single
copy
of
the
transcript,
you
would
not
need
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
raise
this
issue.
the
possession
of
a
transcript
would
be
immaterial.
the
issue
could
be
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
content
of
the
transcript
would
be
immaterial.
the
state
courts
in
this
case
and
the
federal
courts
have
never
passed
upon
this
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
of
course
the
petitioner,
you
might
say
would
be
even
in
a
better
position
if
he
didn't
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
if
he
were
raising
this
point.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
but
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
if
you're
raising
the
point
that
there
--
the
--
there
are
some
invidious
discrimination
in
providing
an
individual
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
defendant
with
the
transcript
in
requiring
codefendants
to
share
a
transcript.
you
don't
need
a
transcript
to
reach
this
issue,
then
the
order
of
the
district
court
would
be
meaningless.
the
court
could
have
found
if
it
reached
that
issue
that
this
man
had
been
discriminated
against,
it
would've
set
aside
its
conviction
and
ordered
the
reinstatement
of
the
appellate
process,
this
wasn't
done.
the
decision
that
was
reached
and
arrived
at
by
the
district
court
which
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
this
man
who
alleged
no
error,
who
we
assumed
--
we
have
no
other
course
but
to
assume
that
he
can't
think
of
any
possible
error.
and
here
is
a
man
that
comes
before
the
court
and
is
asking
for
a
transcript
at
state
expense,
in
other
words
for
the
state
to
subsidize
his
exploration
in
the
anticipation
that
maybe
he'll
come
up
with
something
that
he
can
present
to
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
record
discloses
these
alleged
facts.
as
i
said,
there's
no
evidentiary
process
to
get
into
any
certainty,
but
the
record
alleges
these
facts
that
he
asked
the
petitioner,
asked
the
california
court
of
appeal
for
a
copy
of
his
transcript
some
five
or
six
years
after
his
conviction
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal.
he
was
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
if
he
had
the
funds
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor,
he
was
indigent.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
allegation
is
that
he
was
indigent.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
he
asked
for
a
copy
your
honor,
not
to
see
a
copy,
asked
for
a
copy.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
no
your
honor.
again,
there's
a
--
looking
at
this
case
in
its
broadest
scope,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
provide
any
requesting
indigent
who
is
a
potential
applicant
for
some
form
of
collateral
attack
with
documents
at
state
expense,
we
don't
provide
him
attorney
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
what
harm
would
it
do
your
honor
in
reply
to
--
provide
him
with
an
attorney
or
to
provide
with
a
team
of
investigators
or
provide
him
with
some
experts.
there's
any
number
of
things
that
you
could
not
necessarily
say
would
be
--
would
be
harmful.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
the
court
would've
made
it
available
to
him
if
he
could
have
arranged
for
the
reproduction
of
the
record,
that's
what
the
facts
of
this
case
disclose.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
murphy
if
the
petitioner
himself
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
if
he
had
had
the
money,
he
could
have
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
he
could
have
had
a
copy
of
the
record,
but
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court,
i
think
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
here
is
how
i
would
pose
the
question.
is
the
state
responsible
to
provide
a
record
to
an
indigent
in
his
continuing
efforts
to
search
for
a
possible
error
in
his
trial
or
to
put
in
another
way,
is
the
alleviation
of
any
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
prisoner
about
the
validity
of
his
state
conviction,
so
important,
so
fundamentally
important
that
the
state
must
assume
the
great
financial
burden
far
greater
than
any
burden
it
has
right
now.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
of
providing
a
transcript
for
any
indigent
who
request
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
let
me
answer
the
question
this
way.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
i
--
on
an
administrative
basis,
on
a
legislative
basis,
some
procedure
might
be
devised
which
would
permit
an
incarcerated
prisoner
a
glance
or
a
look
at
his
particular
record.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
well,
does
a
wealthy
prisoner
your
honor
have
any
real
need
for
the
transcript?
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that's
i
think
is
a
basic
question.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
that's
right
your
honor.
but
he
--
there's
also
many
other
--
there's
many
other
things
that
he
can't
have
because
he
can't
pay
for
it.
he
can't
have
an
attorney,
he
can't
have
experts,
he
can't
have
investigators
during
the
course
of
his
incarceration
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
upon
a
mere
request
for
these
services,
he
is
entitled
to
it.
now,
let
me
emphasize
one
more
thing.
we
don't
have
an
absolute
final
foreclosure
or
preclusion
of
this
inmate
from
access
to
the
record,
nothing
is
final
here.
all
we're
asking
is
that
this
potential
applicant
come
forward
and
state
to
some
court
on
apparently
meritorious
ground
why
his
conviction
was
invalid
or
why
his
custody
is
illegal,
that's
all
we're
asking.
so
we
have
a
balance,
we
had
a
great
financial
burden
upon
the
state
to
provide
transcripts
to
indigent
and
on
the
other
side,
a
rather
minimal
requirement
that
the
man
tell
the
court,
apprise
the
court
that
he
is
not
engaged
in
a
mere
exploratory
fishing
expedition
in
the
hope
that
he
is
going
to
find
some
error
and
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
your
honor
if
he
had
--
if
the
petitioner
had
come
forward
and
alleged
some
trial
error,
if
he
had
come
forth
--
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
but
that
the
district
court
judge
could've
required
the
state
to
produce
the
trial
transcript.
mr.
john
t.
murphy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
district
court
in
--
under
those
circumstances
would
be
on
a
fishing
expedition
of
its
own.
i
think
in
order
to
get
a
justiciable
issue
before
the
district
court,
there
has
to
be
some
allegation
of
error
in
the
trial.
now,
if
this
petitioner
had
alleged
that
his
attorney
never
discussed
defenses
with
him,
that
there
was
facts
outside
the
record
that
affected
something
that
occurred
during
the
trial,
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
then
for
the
trial
transcript
to
resolve
that.
all
we're
asking
in
this
case
is
to
alleviate
--
not
to
alleviate
because
we
don't
have
the
burden
yet,
but
they
asked
this
court
to
--
not
to
impose
upon
the
states
the
burden
of
financing
the
indigent
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
--
continuing
efforts
once
the
state
has
satisfied
itself
that
the
man
has
been
validly
--
mr.
john
t.
murphy
yes
your
honor.
