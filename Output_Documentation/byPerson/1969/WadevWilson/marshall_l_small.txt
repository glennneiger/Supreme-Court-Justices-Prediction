mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
this
case,
petitioner
wade
was
tried
with
codefendant,
pollard,
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
each
of
the
defendants
filed
a
notice
for
appeal.
had
they
been
tried
separately,
under
the
california
rules
of
court,
each
of
the
codefendants
would
have
been
furnished
a
separate
trial
transcript.
however,
they
were
tried
together
and,
therefore,
under
the
rules
only
one
transcript
was
made
available
to
both
defendants.
and
that
transcript
was
sent
to
the
codefendant,
pollard,
wade
here
did
not
see
that
transcript.
he
didn't
have
the
opportunity
therefore
to
inspect
the
transcript
before
it
was
certified
as
correct
for
purposes
of
the
appeal.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
separate
lawyer
appointed
at
that
time,
your
honor.
there
was
a
new
appellate
counsel
appointed
for
petitioner
wade
here
in
connection
with
the
appeal.
the
record
doesn't
make
clear
at
what
point
in
time
he
was
appointed.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
correct.
we
do
--
we
do
not
have
that
in
his
record.
the
case
went
up
on
appeal,
oral
argument
was
waived.
the
decision
was
affirmed
and
thereafter,
subsequently,
the
petitioner
instituted
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
to
try
and
obtain
a
copy
of
its
transcript
for
the
purpose
of
instituting
collateral
attack
on
his
convictions.
he
first
applied
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
it
affirmed
the
conviction
and
that
court
told
him
they'd
had
had
no
facilities
for
duplicating
the
transcript.
he
applied
to
the
california
supreme
court.
they
told
him
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
of
appeals.
the
transcript
hereof
record
then
indicates
that
following
correspondence
with
california
courts
became
clear
that
in
order
to
obtain
a
copy
of
this
transcript
he
would
have
to
pay
for
it.
it
was
available
for
duplication
if
he
paid
for
it,
but
that's
the
only
way
that
he
could
get
it.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
would
assume
they
do
under
rule
ten
by
direction
of
the
court
they
could've
made
it
available,
but
they
have
taken
no
action
to
do
that.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
have
looked
at
the
record
myself,
just
briefly
perused
at
--
had
it
sent
up
from
los
angeles
to
san
francisco.
it
is
approximately
800
pages
long.
i
used
in
my
brief
my
calculations
for
the
cost
of
reproduction
were
based
on
that
800
pages
and
on
commercial
reproduction
rates
in
the
bay
area
and
what
--
we
figured
out
that
would
be
about
$80
and
the
--
on
reproduction
rates
at
the
court's
own
reproduction
facilities
were
utilized
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
right
it
would
be
substantially
less
than
commercial
rates.
what
we
have
here
then
in
summary
is
a
case
that
really
presents,
i
think
a
fairly
narrow
issue.
the
case
where
a
defendant
was
denied
his
right
to
a
transcript
by
the
application
to
the
california
rules
of
court
in
connection
with
his
direct
appeal.
and,
therefore,
it
comes
around
now
for
purpose
of
collateral
attack
as
an
indigent
and
is
unable
to
get
a
copy
of
this
transcript
unless
he
can
first
demonstrate
errors
in
his
original
conviction.
i
might
add
the
--
that
he
filed
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
after
he
had
been
turned
down
by
the
california
courts.
the
district
court
found
that,
yes,
he
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
and
order
he
be
supplied
one
or
else
discharged.
the
case
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
said
that
he
was
required
to
first
show
meritorious
grounds
for
off
setting
his
conviction.
turning
to
the
argument
now,
on
the
first
stage
of
the
argument,
the
question
is
to
whether
he
was
unconstitutionally
denied
his
right
to
the
transcript
in
connection
with
his
direct
appeal
is
a
predicate
for
moving
on
to
second
stage.
we
feel
that
the
operation,
the
california
rules
of
court
are
discriminatory
in
at
least
two
respects.
number
one,
in
the
way
they
discriminate
between
defendants
tried
separately
and
defendants
tried
jointly.
if
the
defendants
tried
separately,
he
is
entitled
to
a
transcript
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
or
a
pauper
and
regardless
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
involved
or
the
severity
of
the
sentence
imposed.
if
he
is
tried
jointly,
he
isn't
entitled
to
a
separate
transcript
even
if
he
is
an
indigent.
we
also
feel
that
as
a
second
basis
for
claiming
discrimination
as
far
as
indigents
are
concerned
the
operation
of
the
california
rules
of
court
preclude
an
indigent
codefendant
from
receiving
a
right
to
a
trial
transcript
in
connection
with
an
appeal
and
this
case
is
an
example
of
how
that
sort
of
rule
can
work.
so
that,
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
rules
as
they
operate
tend
to
unconstitutionally
deny
particularly
an
indigent
defendant
his
right
to
a
trial
transcript.
now,
the
state
has
argued
that
all
that's
necessary
is
access
and
that
the
attorney
on
appeal
had
access
to
the
trial
transcript
for
purpose
of
briefing
the
case.
first
of
all,
this
sort
of
case
demonstrates
access
may
not
be
sufficient
in
connection
with
reviewing
the
correctness
of
the
record.
it's
--
that's
possible
and
that
--
and
it
worked
out
that
way.
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
fundamental,
is
the
burden
that
it
places
on
appointed
counsel
in
trying
to
brief
and
prepare
cases
if
they
have
only
access
to
a
record
where
they
have
to
borrow
it
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
references
to
some
of
the
problems
encountered,
discussed
and
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
hardy
case,
appointed
counsel
in
indigent
cases
may
face
when
they
are
trying
to
prepare
cases.
so,
therefore,
the
appeal
that
--
the
type
of
access
that
the
state
says
was
made
available
here
really
should
not
be
viewed
as
constitutionally
sufficient
for
the
protection
of
indigents
to
give
them
the
same
sorts
of
access
to
legal
channels
to
effectuate
justice
as
are
available
to
persons
who
are
not
indigents.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
really
do
not
think
so.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes.
they
were
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals'
footnote.
they
raised
question
and
it
might
be
a
good
ander's
point
but
they
had
an
--
he
hadn't
exhaust
the
state
remedies
on
that.
i
think
the
reference
to
state
remedies
refer
to
the
ander's
point,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir.
i
don't,
i
think
that
remark
was
directed
to
the
ander's
point
which
i
am
of
course
not
trying
to
raise
and
consider
here
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i'm
really
not
prepared
to
make
that
contention.
i
think
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
prejudice
resulted
to
this
man
by
not
having
separate
transcript
available
either
to
examine
before
it
was
certified
as
correct
on
appeal
or
at
subsequent
stages
in
the
procedure.
we
can
only
speculate
on
that.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes,
i
do.
i'm
afraid
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
as
satisfactory
as
it
should
be.
although
i
believe
that
the
state's
willing
to
concede
the
factual
predicate
that's
set
out
in
the
exhibits
to
my
reply
brief
that
there
is
basis
for
certainly
contending
that
the
record
was
not
available
for
preparation
of
our
petition
for
rehearing
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
would
be
--
i
think
the
ultimate
result
of
your
primary
--
first
off,
i
think
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
a
copy
of
this
transcript
so
that
he
can
at
least
--
at
the
very
least,
at
the
minimum,
he
should
at
least
have
a
copy
of
his
transcript
so
that
he
can
examine
it
and
prepare
its
basis
for
collateral
attack.
step
two
and
we'd
ask
for
that
in
our
original
brief
that
we
filed,
he
should
have
a
right
to
appellate
review
again
of
his
conviction.
but
primarily,
our
first
argument
is
that
he
should
at
least
at
the
very
minimum
have
a
right
to
a
transcript
to
prepare
for
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
not
specifically.
i
think
that
that
result
can
be
drawn
by
putting
together
cases
such
as
smith
and
bennett
and
gardner
v.
california.
in
the
smith
case,
the
court
indicated
that
you
couldn't
impose
a
burden
on
access
to
habeas
corpus
by
a
minimal
--
afford
a
filing
fee,
i
think
it
was.
in
gardner,
in
effect
the
court
was
saying
just
this
last
term
that
for
purpose
of
effectuate,
really
effectuate
pursuing
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
you
had
to
make
available
the
transcript
of
the
prior
proceeding.
now,
you
could
argue
as
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
was
state
habeas,
that's
correct.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no,
not
necessarily
and
of
course
that's
a
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief
that
you
can
draw
a
legitimate
distinction
between
right
to
counsel
where
a
man
made
--
file
repeated
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
may
or
may
not
be
meritorious
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
which
you
need
only
once.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
the
fourteenth
amendment,
violation
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
equal
protection.
that
an
indigent
--
i'm
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right,
that
he
has
none
of
his
own
and
carrying
that
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
i
think
you
could
carry
it
up
a
step
further
and
say
that
there
are
other
examples
of
how
he
was
discriminated
against,
including
on
collateral
attack.
he
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
a
person
who
is
moneyed
defendant.
the
whole
theory
of
the
roberts
v.
lavallee
and
the
cases
that
stem
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
not
necessarily,
not
necessarily.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
advance
that
argument
here,
in
this
particular
proceeding
but
simply
the
right
to
the
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
only
wish
i
knew
your
honor.
i
really
don't
know
the
basis
by
which
they
do
that.
the
--
this
is
--
in
this
particular
transcript
as
i
recall
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
speak
from
my
own
personal
perusal
of
the
transcript
as
what
apparently
happened
and
since
it's
not
of
record
in
the
case,
but
on
the
facts
that
were
alleged
in
the
habeas
petition
here,
which
haven't
been
denied,
petitioner
wade
never
saw
a
copy
of
his
transcript,
never
had
it
available.
one
other
pint
in
connection
with
the
state's
argument
as
to
access
as
we
--
it
was
the
case
here
being
sufficient
it
works
a
particularly
discriminatory
result
on
subsequent
proceeding
on
collateral
attack
because
even
if
you
say
access
is
sufficient
for
any
defendant,
you
only
have
to
allow
him
to
see
a
transcript
and
not
give
him
a
copy
of
it
then
the
state
switches
its
position
on
collateral
attack
and
no
longer
grants
the
right
of
access
an
in
effect
is
saying,
well,
you
can't
see
your
transcript
unless
you
first
show
meritorious
grounds
for
off
setting
your
conviction.
so
that
even
if
you
were
to
use
the
access
point
that
the
state
is
using
here
to
try
and
uphold
the
procedure
the
petitioner
here
is
twice
in
a
less
advantageous
position
than
he
otherwise
would
be
in.
the
state
is
arguing
in
effect
two
points,
essentially
two
points
as
i
see
it
in
trying
to
sustain
the
position
that
the
petitioner
should
not
have
a
right
to
a
transcript.
they
are
in
effect
saying
first
all
that
the
burden
on
the
state
economically
would
just
be
terrifying
because
then
anybody
could
come
in
and
on
purposes
of
collateral
attack
ask
for
a
right
to
a
transcript,
but
that
isn't
this
case.
they
were
referring
to
statistics
where
maybe
no
transcript
had
ever
been
prepared
and
the
person
would
come
in
and
apply
for
a
transcript
for
purposes
of
collateral
attack.
this
is
a
case
where
a
transcript
had
been
prepared
and
was
indeed
available
and
could
easily
have
been
copied
at
a
fairly
small
cost.
so
the
type
of
statistics
that
the
state
is
citing
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
undue
economic
burden
really
aren't
relevant
to
this
particular
case
which
is
really
a
fairly
narrow
case.
i
say
it's
a
case
where
there
is
a
transcript
in
existence.
the
man
would've
gotten
it
in
connection
with
his
original
appeal,
but
for
the
particular
operation
of
the
california
rules
on
appeal.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir.
i
felt
under
the
terms
of
the
appointment
that
my
obligation
was
to
brief
and
argue
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes
sir.
the
second
argument
that
the
state
presents
for
denying
his
right
to
transcript
to
this
petitioner
is
that
it
may
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
prison
discipline.
a
suggestion
is
made
that
a
prisoner
gets
a
transcript,
he
might
be
discussing
his
case
with
other
prisoners
and
this
could
hamper
prison
discipline.
i'm
a
little
perplexed
by
this
argument
because
as
i
understand
it,
a
prisoner
who
say
was
tried
individually
rather
than
jointly
and
convicted
and
furnished
a
transcript
would
be
entitled
to
keep
his
transcript
and
have
it
in
prison
with
him
and
use
it
there
so
that
in
effect,
the
state
is
arguing
that
it's
only
codefendants
who
were
tried
jointly
who
might
be
causing
problems
with
the
prison
discipline
by
having
the
right
to
their
transcripts
and
the
--
i
just
don't
think
that
this
argument
really
holds
water
when
you
look
at
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
the
basic
premise
i
think
here
come
down
me
is
really
is
the
question
of
trying
to
balance
--
carry
out
as
effectively
as
possible
the
administration
of
justice,
the
persons
who
were
incarcerated
by
not
clogging
up
the
channels
of
judicial
administration,
making
available
to
them
the
instruments
necessary
to
vindicate
their
rights,
but
the
same
time,
not
thrusting
unreasonable
burdens
on
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
where
you
have
the
man
who
would've
had
a
transcript
but
for
the
peculiar
operation,
the
discriminatory
operation
of
california
law,
where
a
transcript
is
available
and
can
easily
be
reproduced
that
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
making
the
transcript
available
to
a
person
such
as
this
indigent.
in
terms
of
trying
to
carry
out
the
line
of
cases,
griffin,
roberts
and
lavallee,
those
cases
that
try
to
ensure
that
the
channels
of
the
courts,
the
access
to
vindication
of
legal
rights
will
be
available
to
all
without
any
distinction
based
on
financial
position
of
the
defendant
involved.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
now
for
rebuttal
if
i
could
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i'll
need
to
take
very
much
additional
time.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
two
or
three
points
that
have
been
raised
in
the
course
of
the
counsel's
presentation
of
argument
and
some
of
the
questions
raised
from
the
bench.
one
of
the
points
that
you
raised
yourself
was
the
possibility
of
obtaining
of
show
cause
order
to
require
pollard
to
turn
over
his
copy
of
the
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
one
of
the
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
raised
was
the
possibility
of
ordering
pollard,
the
codefendant
here
who
apparently
still
has
a
copy
of
this
transcript
to
turn
it
over
at
this
stage
in
the
proceeding
for
use
by
this
petitioner
wade.
i'd
have
question
in
my
own
mind
whether
california
would
permit
such
a
procedure
now
because
the
procedure
for
sharing
transcript
is
cached
in
terms
of
the
direct
appeal
process
and
i
therefore
would
have
really
substantial
question
as
to
whether
a
california
court
would
be
prepared
to
enter
such
an
order
at
this
point.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
suppose
he
could
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
suppose
that
might
have
been
the
result,
but
i
think
that
that
in
and
of
itself
underscores
the
unfair
application
of
these
california
rules
of
court.
assume
for
instance
that
there
were
four
or
five
codefendants
tried
here
rather
than
just
two
codefendants
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
because
i
think
that
puts
a
burden
on
the
indigent
and
his
appointed
counsel.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
to
have
to
go
to
court
and
fight
to
get
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
use,
a
burden
that
a
moneyed
defendant
would
not
have
placed
upon
it.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i'd
say
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor
that
it
--
that
he
is
certainly
having
to
take
it
up
through
this
sort
of
procedure
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no,
i
understand
that.
certainly,
it
would
have
--
well,
just
the
cost
of
producing
the
transcript
would
have
been
a
much
smaller
portion
of
the
cost
of
bringing
the
proceedings
up
to
this
court
and
paying
for
bringing
attorneys
back
here
to
argue
the
case.
but
this
of
course,
this
case
is
simply
going
to
be
exemplary
of
other
codefendant
cases
that
come
up
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
it
would
be
easier
though
i
believe
in
the
terms
of
the
administration
of
justice
if
instead
of
requiring
court
appointed
counsel
for
indigents
to
fight
to
get
copies
of
the
record.
if
it
were
made
clear
that
they
should
be
furnished
them
as
a
matter
of
course
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir,
that's
quite
alright.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
my
argument
is
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
supply
it
years
ago
and
because
they
didn't,
he
should
not
be
placed
in
a
less
advantageous
position
now
because
of
his
indigency
and
having
to
show
meritorious
grounds
for
reversal
before
he
can
even
have
a
look
at
his
trial
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes,
and
i
am
not
arguing
for
that.
i'm
not
arguing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
if
he
had
been
given
his
appellate
--
and
he
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes.
i
would
say
and
i'd
grant,
just
go
ahead
and
go
beyond
this
particular
case,
i
would
argue
that
the
state
should
furnish
him
that
copy
on
balance
because
of
the
relative
smaller
expense
involved
where
a
copy
of
the
transcript
is
available
and
can
be
reproduced.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
here.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
the
opinion
could
be
so
read,
however,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
to
deny
relief
to
this
petitioner
simply
because
of
the
broader
basis
upon
which
the
district
court
may
have
posited
its
result.
this
court
could
cut
down
the
basis
for
granting
a
transcript
to
this
particular
petitioner.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right
and
in
the
same
way
in
most
states
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
--
in
most
states
this
question
isn't
going
to
come
up
because
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states
give
transcripts
to
individual
defendants
whether
--
and
the
codefendants.
they
make
no
distinction
the
way
that
california
and
limited
number
of
states
do.
so
they
were
talking
about
if
there
were
a
narrow
issue.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
in
substance
is
really
my
contention
that
that
as
modern
techniques
become
available,
they
really
should
be
applied
to
judicial
process
such
as
the
stenotype
machine
here
in
this
court
that
over
a
period
of
time
that
hopefully
by
using
modern
methods
of
recording
and
duplicating
trial
transcripts,
we
won't
have
to
get
into
this
type
of
situation.
they'll
be
either
way
available
and
easily
reproducible.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you
sir.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
this
case,
petitioner
wade
was
tried
with
codefendant,
pollard,
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
each
of
the
defendants
filed
a
notice
for
appeal.
had
they
been
tried
separately,
under
the
california
rules
of
court,
each
of
the
codefendants
would
have
been
furnished
a
separate
trial
transcript.
however,
they
were
tried
together
and,
therefore,
under
the
rules
only
one
transcript
was
made
available
to
both
defendants.
and
that
transcript
was
sent
to
the
codefendant,
pollard,
wade
here
did
not
see
that
transcript.
he
didn't
have
the
opportunity
therefore
to
inspect
the
transcript
before
it
was
certified
as
correct
for
purposes
of
the
appeal.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
separate
lawyer
appointed
at
that
time,
your
honor.
there
was
a
new
appellate
counsel
appointed
for
petitioner
wade
here
in
connection
with
the
appeal.
the
record
doesn't
make
clear
at
what
point
in
time
he
was
appointed.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
correct.
we
do
--
we
do
not
have
that
in
his
record.
the
case
went
up
on
appeal,
oral
argument
was
waived.
the
decision
was
affirmed
and
thereafter,
subsequently,
the
petitioner
instituted
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
to
try
and
obtain
a
copy
of
its
transcript
for
the
purpose
of
instituting
collateral
attack
on
his
convictions.
he
first
applied
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
and
it
affirmed
the
conviction
and
that
court
told
him
they'd
had
had
no
facilities
for
duplicating
the
transcript.
he
applied
to
the
california
supreme
court.
they
told
him
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
of
appeals.
the
transcript
hereof
record
then
indicates
that
following
correspondence
with
california
courts
became
clear
that
in
order
to
obtain
a
copy
of
this
transcript
he
would
have
to
pay
for
it.
it
was
available
for
duplication
if
he
paid
for
it,
but
that's
the
only
way
that
he
could
get
it.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
would
assume
they
do
under
rule
ten
by
direction
of
the
court
they
could've
made
it
available,
but
they
have
taken
no
action
to
do
that.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
have
looked
at
the
record
myself,
just
briefly
perused
at
--
had
it
sent
up
from
los
angeles
to
san
francisco.
it
is
approximately
800
pages
long.
i
used
in
my
brief
my
calculations
for
the
cost
of
reproduction
were
based
on
that
800
pages
and
on
commercial
reproduction
rates
in
the
bay
area
and
what
--
we
figured
out
that
would
be
about
$80
and
the
--
on
reproduction
rates
at
the
court's
own
reproduction
facilities
were
utilized
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
right
it
would
be
substantially
less
than
commercial
rates.
what
we
have
here
then
in
summary
is
a
case
that
really
presents,
i
think
a
fairly
narrow
issue.
the
case
where
a
defendant
was
denied
his
right
to
a
transcript
by
the
application
to
the
california
rules
of
court
in
connection
with
his
direct
appeal.
and,
therefore,
it
comes
around
now
for
purpose
of
collateral
attack
as
an
indigent
and
is
unable
to
get
a
copy
of
this
transcript
unless
he
can
first
demonstrate
errors
in
his
original
conviction.
i
might
add
the
--
that
he
filed
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
after
he
had
been
turned
down
by
the
california
courts.
the
district
court
found
that,
yes,
he
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
and
order
he
be
supplied
one
or
else
discharged.
the
case
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
said
that
he
was
required
to
first
show
meritorious
grounds
for
off
setting
his
conviction.
turning
to
the
argument
now,
on
the
first
stage
of
the
argument,
the
question
is
to
whether
he
was
unconstitutionally
denied
his
right
to
the
transcript
in
connection
with
his
direct
appeal
is
a
predicate
for
moving
on
to
second
stage.
we
feel
that
the
operation,
the
california
rules
of
court
are
discriminatory
in
at
least
two
respects.
number
one,
in
the
way
they
discriminate
between
defendants
tried
separately
and
defendants
tried
jointly.
if
the
defendants
tried
separately,
he
is
entitled
to
a
transcript
whether
he
is
a
millionaire
or
a
pauper
and
regardless
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
involved
or
the
severity
of
the
sentence
imposed.
if
he
is
tried
jointly,
he
isn't
entitled
to
a
separate
transcript
even
if
he
is
an
indigent.
we
also
feel
that
as
a
second
basis
for
claiming
discrimination
as
far
as
indigents
are
concerned
the
operation
of
the
california
rules
of
court
preclude
an
indigent
codefendant
from
receiving
a
right
to
a
trial
transcript
in
connection
with
an
appeal
and
this
case
is
an
example
of
how
that
sort
of
rule
can
work.
so
that,
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
rules
as
they
operate
tend
to
unconstitutionally
deny
particularly
an
indigent
defendant
his
right
to
a
trial
transcript.
now,
the
state
has
argued
that
all
that's
necessary
is
access
and
that
the
attorney
on
appeal
had
access
to
the
trial
transcript
for
purpose
of
briefing
the
case.
first
of
all,
this
sort
of
case
demonstrates
access
may
not
be
sufficient
in
connection
with
reviewing
the
correctness
of
the
record.
it's
--
that's
possible
and
that
--
and
it
worked
out
that
way.
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
fundamental,
is
the
burden
that
it
places
on
appointed
counsel
in
trying
to
brief
and
prepare
cases
if
they
have
only
access
to
a
record
where
they
have
to
borrow
it
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
references
to
some
of
the
problems
encountered,
discussed
and
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
hardy
case,
appointed
counsel
in
indigent
cases
may
face
when
they
are
trying
to
prepare
cases.
so,
therefore,
the
appeal
that
--
the
type
of
access
that
the
state
says
was
made
available
here
really
should
not
be
viewed
as
constitutionally
sufficient
for
the
protection
of
indigents
to
give
them
the
same
sorts
of
access
to
legal
channels
to
effectuate
justice
as
are
available
to
persons
who
are
not
indigents.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
really
do
not
think
so.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes.
they
were
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals'
footnote.
they
raised
question
and
it
might
be
a
good
ander's
point
but
they
had
an
--
he
hadn't
exhaust
the
state
remedies
on
that.
i
think
the
reference
to
state
remedies
refer
to
the
ander's
point,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir.
i
don't,
i
think
that
remark
was
directed
to
the
ander's
point
which
i
am
of
course
not
trying
to
raise
and
consider
here
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i'm
really
not
prepared
to
make
that
contention.
i
think
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
prejudice
resulted
to
this
man
by
not
having
separate
transcript
available
either
to
examine
before
it
was
certified
as
correct
on
appeal
or
at
subsequent
stages
in
the
procedure.
we
can
only
speculate
on
that.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes,
i
do.
i'm
afraid
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
as
satisfactory
as
it
should
be.
although
i
believe
that
the
state's
willing
to
concede
the
factual
predicate
that's
set
out
in
the
exhibits
to
my
reply
brief
that
there
is
basis
for
certainly
contending
that
the
record
was
not
available
for
preparation
of
our
petition
for
rehearing
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
would
be
--
i
think
the
ultimate
result
of
your
primary
--
first
off,
i
think
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
a
copy
of
this
transcript
so
that
he
can
at
least
--
at
the
very
least,
at
the
minimum,
he
should
at
least
have
a
copy
of
his
transcript
so
that
he
can
examine
it
and
prepare
its
basis
for
collateral
attack.
step
two
and
we'd
ask
for
that
in
our
original
brief
that
we
filed,
he
should
have
a
right
to
appellate
review
again
of
his
conviction.
but
primarily,
our
first
argument
is
that
he
should
at
least
at
the
very
minimum
have
a
right
to
a
transcript
to
prepare
for
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
not
specifically.
i
think
that
that
result
can
be
drawn
by
putting
together
cases
such
as
smith
and
bennett
and
gardner
v.
california.
in
the
smith
case,
the
court
indicated
that
you
couldn't
impose
a
burden
on
access
to
habeas
corpus
by
a
minimal
--
afford
a
filing
fee,
i
think
it
was.
in
gardner,
in
effect
the
court
was
saying
just
this
last
term
that
for
purpose
of
effectuate,
really
effectuate
pursuing
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
you
had
to
make
available
the
transcript
of
the
prior
proceeding.
now,
you
could
argue
as
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
was
state
habeas,
that's
correct.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no,
not
necessarily
and
of
course
that's
a
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief
that
you
can
draw
a
legitimate
distinction
between
right
to
counsel
where
a
man
made
--
file
repeated
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
may
or
may
not
be
meritorious
and
the
right
to
a
transcript
which
you
need
only
once.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
the
fourteenth
amendment,
violation
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
equal
protection.
that
an
indigent
--
i'm
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
correct.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right,
that
he
has
none
of
his
own
and
carrying
that
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
i
think
you
could
carry
it
up
a
step
further
and
say
that
there
are
other
examples
of
how
he
was
discriminated
against,
including
on
collateral
attack.
he
is
not
in
the
same
position
as
a
person
who
is
moneyed
defendant.
the
whole
theory
of
the
roberts
v.
lavallee
and
the
cases
that
stem
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
not
necessarily,
not
necessarily.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
advance
that
argument
here,
in
this
particular
proceeding
but
simply
the
right
to
the
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
only
wish
i
knew
your
honor.
i
really
don't
know
the
basis
by
which
they
do
that.
the
--
this
is
--
in
this
particular
transcript
as
i
recall
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
speak
from
my
own
personal
perusal
of
the
transcript
as
what
apparently
happened
and
since
it's
not
of
record
in
the
case,
but
on
the
facts
that
were
alleged
in
the
habeas
petition
here,
which
haven't
been
denied,
petitioner
wade
never
saw
a
copy
of
his
transcript,
never
had
it
available.
one
other
pint
in
connection
with
the
state's
argument
as
to
access
as
we
--
it
was
the
case
here
being
sufficient
it
works
a
particularly
discriminatory
result
on
subsequent
proceeding
on
collateral
attack
because
even
if
you
say
access
is
sufficient
for
any
defendant,
you
only
have
to
allow
him
to
see
a
transcript
and
not
give
him
a
copy
of
it
then
the
state
switches
its
position
on
collateral
attack
and
no
longer
grants
the
right
of
access
an
in
effect
is
saying,
well,
you
can't
see
your
transcript
unless
you
first
show
meritorious
grounds
for
off
setting
your
conviction.
so
that
even
if
you
were
to
use
the
access
point
that
the
state
is
using
here
to
try
and
uphold
the
procedure
the
petitioner
here
is
twice
in
a
less
advantageous
position
than
he
otherwise
would
be
in.
the
state
is
arguing
in
effect
two
points,
essentially
two
points
as
i
see
it
in
trying
to
sustain
the
position
that
the
petitioner
should
not
have
a
right
to
a
transcript.
they
are
in
effect
saying
first
all
that
the
burden
on
the
state
economically
would
just
be
terrifying
because
then
anybody
could
come
in
and
on
purposes
of
collateral
attack
ask
for
a
right
to
a
transcript,
but
that
isn't
this
case.
they
were
referring
to
statistics
where
maybe
no
transcript
had
ever
been
prepared
and
the
person
would
come
in
and
apply
for
a
transcript
for
purposes
of
collateral
attack.
this
is
a
case
where
a
transcript
had
been
prepared
and
was
indeed
available
and
could
easily
have
been
copied
at
a
fairly
small
cost.
so
the
type
of
statistics
that
the
state
is
citing
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
undue
economic
burden
really
aren't
relevant
to
this
particular
case
which
is
really
a
fairly
narrow
case.
i
say
it's
a
case
where
there
is
a
transcript
in
existence.
the
man
would've
gotten
it
in
connection
with
his
original
appeal,
but
for
the
particular
operation
of
the
california
rules
on
appeal.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
was
appointed
by
this
court
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir.
i
felt
under
the
terms
of
the
appointment
that
my
obligation
was
to
brief
and
argue
the
case
before
this
court.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes
sir.
the
second
argument
that
the
state
presents
for
denying
his
right
to
transcript
to
this
petitioner
is
that
it
may
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
prison
discipline.
a
suggestion
is
made
that
a
prisoner
gets
a
transcript,
he
might
be
discussing
his
case
with
other
prisoners
and
this
could
hamper
prison
discipline.
i'm
a
little
perplexed
by
this
argument
because
as
i
understand
it,
a
prisoner
who
say
was
tried
individually
rather
than
jointly
and
convicted
and
furnished
a
transcript
would
be
entitled
to
keep
his
transcript
and
have
it
in
prison
with
him
and
use
it
there
so
that
in
effect,
the
state
is
arguing
that
it's
only
codefendants
who
were
tried
jointly
who
might
be
causing
problems
with
the
prison
discipline
by
having
the
right
to
their
transcripts
and
the
--
i
just
don't
think
that
this
argument
really
holds
water
when
you
look
at
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
the
basic
premise
i
think
here
come
down
me
is
really
is
the
question
of
trying
to
balance
--
carry
out
as
effectively
as
possible
the
administration
of
justice,
the
persons
who
were
incarcerated
by
not
clogging
up
the
channels
of
judicial
administration,
making
available
to
them
the
instruments
necessary
to
vindicate
their
rights,
but
the
same
time,
not
thrusting
unreasonable
burdens
on
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
where
you
have
the
man
who
would've
had
a
transcript
but
for
the
peculiar
operation,
the
discriminatory
operation
of
california
law,
where
a
transcript
is
available
and
can
easily
be
reproduced
that
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
making
the
transcript
available
to
a
person
such
as
this
indigent.
in
terms
of
trying
to
carry
out
the
line
of
cases,
griffin,
roberts
and
lavallee,
those
cases
that
try
to
ensure
that
the
channels
of
the
courts,
the
access
to
vindication
of
legal
rights
will
be
available
to
all
without
any
distinction
based
on
financial
position
of
the
defendant
involved.
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
now
for
rebuttal
if
i
could
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i'll
need
to
take
very
much
additional
time.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
two
or
three
points
that
have
been
raised
in
the
course
of
the
counsel's
presentation
of
argument
and
some
of
the
questions
raised
from
the
bench.
one
of
the
points
that
you
raised
yourself
was
the
possibility
of
obtaining
of
show
cause
order
to
require
pollard
to
turn
over
his
copy
of
the
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
well,
excuse
me
mr.
justice
black.
one
of
the
point
that
mr.
chief
justice
raised
was
the
possibility
of
ordering
pollard,
the
codefendant
here
who
apparently
still
has
a
copy
of
this
transcript
to
turn
it
over
at
this
stage
in
the
proceeding
for
use
by
this
petitioner
wade.
i'd
have
question
in
my
own
mind
whether
california
would
permit
such
a
procedure
now
because
the
procedure
for
sharing
transcript
is
cached
in
terms
of
the
direct
appeal
process
and
i
therefore
would
have
really
substantial
question
as
to
whether
a
california
court
would
be
prepared
to
enter
such
an
order
at
this
point.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
suppose
he
could
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i
suppose
that
might
have
been
the
result,
but
i
think
that
that
in
and
of
itself
underscores
the
unfair
application
of
these
california
rules
of
court.
assume
for
instance
that
there
were
four
or
five
codefendants
tried
here
rather
than
just
two
codefendants
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
because
i
think
that
puts
a
burden
on
the
indigent
and
his
appointed
counsel.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
to
have
to
go
to
court
and
fight
to
get
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
use,
a
burden
that
a
moneyed
defendant
would
not
have
placed
upon
it.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
i'd
say
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor
that
it
--
that
he
is
certainly
having
to
take
it
up
through
this
sort
of
procedure
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no,
i
understand
that.
certainly,
it
would
have
--
well,
just
the
cost
of
producing
the
transcript
would
have
been
a
much
smaller
portion
of
the
cost
of
bringing
the
proceedings
up
to
this
court
and
paying
for
bringing
attorneys
back
here
to
argue
the
case.
but
this
of
course,
this
case
is
simply
going
to
be
exemplary
of
other
codefendant
cases
that
come
up
in
the
california
courts.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
it
would
be
easier
though
i
believe
in
the
terms
of
the
administration
of
justice
if
instead
of
requiring
court
appointed
counsel
for
indigents
to
fight
to
get
copies
of
the
record.
if
it
were
made
clear
that
they
should
be
furnished
them
as
a
matter
of
course
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
no
sir,
that's
quite
alright.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
my
argument
is
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
supply
it
years
ago
and
because
they
didn't,
he
should
not
be
placed
in
a
less
advantageous
position
now
because
of
his
indigency
and
having
to
show
meritorious
grounds
for
reversal
before
he
can
even
have
a
look
at
his
trial
transcript.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes,
and
i
am
not
arguing
for
that.
i'm
not
arguing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
if
he
had
been
given
his
appellate
--
and
he
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
marshall
l.
small
yes.
i
would
say
and
i'd
grant,
just
go
ahead
and
go
beyond
this
particular
case,
i
would
argue
that
the
state
should
furnish
him
that
copy
on
balance
because
of
the
relative
smaller
expense
involved
where
a
copy
of
the
transcript
is
available
and
can
be
reproduced.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
argue
that
here.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
the
opinion
could
be
so
read,
however,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
to
deny
relief
to
this
petitioner
simply
because
of
the
broader
basis
upon
which
the
district
court
may
have
posited
its
result.
this
court
could
cut
down
the
basis
for
granting
a
transcript
to
this
particular
petitioner.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that's
right
and
in
the
same
way
in
most
states
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
--
in
most
states
this
question
isn't
going
to
come
up
because
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states
give
transcripts
to
individual
defendants
whether
--
and
the
codefendants.
they
make
no
distinction
the
way
that
california
and
limited
number
of
states
do.
so
they
were
talking
about
if
there
were
a
narrow
issue.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marshall
l.
small
that
in
substance
is
really
my
contention
that
that
as
modern
techniques
become
available,
they
really
should
be
applied
to
judicial
process
such
as
the
stenotype
machine
here
in
this
court
that
over
a
period
of
time
that
hopefully
by
using
modern
methods
of
recording
and
duplicating
trial
transcripts,
we
won't
have
to
get
into
this
type
of
situation.
they'll
be
either
way
available
and
easily
reproducible.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
l.
small
thank
you
sir.
