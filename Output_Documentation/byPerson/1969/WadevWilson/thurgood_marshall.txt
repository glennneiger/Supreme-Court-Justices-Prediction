certain
room
where
they
can
go
and
use
it,
could
they
take
it
to
their
office,
could
they
xerox
it?
what
do
we
mean
by
access?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
murphy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
that
this
transcript,
there
is
one
that
he
had
on
appeal
is
still
available
some
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
--
i
understood
you
to
say,
you
gave
him
one
when
he
went
up
on
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
is
there
more
than
one
copy
of
this
transcript
available
as
of
this
moment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
not
give
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you
don't
need
the
one,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
all
of
that,
but
i
don't
see
the
need
for
the
xerox
copies.
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
can
give
him
a
copy
which
is
available
and
which
state
don't
need,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
murphy,
what
is
the
financial
burden
of
giving
him
the
record
that
they
have,
you
said
they
had
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
financial
burden.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
if
--
would
you
agree
that
it
would
fair
to
say
that
if
there
is
one
available,
it
should
be
shared
with
the
prisoner,
that
there'd
be
no
financial
burden
there,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
you
think
he
should
have
the
same
right
as
the
wealthy
prisoner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
unless
i
misunderstood
you,
you
said
that
this
man
could
get
it
if
he
could
pay
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
reason
he
couldn't
get
it
was
because
he
couldn't
pay
for
it?
