justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state,
the
method
california
use
this
when
they
have
three
or
four
defendants
to
make
a
copy
of
your
evidence
available
to
all
of
them?
i
don't
mean
all
at
the
same
time,
but
what
is
your
method,
if
you
are
familiar
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
state
draw
about
fulfilling
this
obligation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
just
leave
it
up
to
the
different
defendant,
if
you
get
from
another
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
are
saying
is
--
in
preparing
his
brief,
or
use
in
preparing
his
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it's
yes
as
to
whether
the
state
will
furnish
each
individual
defendant
with
a
complete
transcript
of
the
record,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
have
we
ever
held
that
where
there
are
more
than
one
defendant,
the
state
is
under
an
obligation,
and
they're
all
indigent,
the
state
is
under
an
obligation
to
file
a
complete
transcript
with
each
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
have
we
held
--
has
there
been
any
in
a
case
which
either
raised
this
question
or
decided
the
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
there
are
four
or
five
defendant,
the
state
has
to
supply
four
or
five
transcripts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
view
--
your
argument
then
that
the
state
is
not
compelled
to
provide
a
transcript
for
collateral
attacks
only
during
the
time
that
matter
can
be
held
on
the
appellate
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
the
original
judgment,
is
that
to
--
what
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
copy
available
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
he
indigent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
a
copy
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
asked
to
see
a
copy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
the
only
issue
between
them
whether
you
give
it
to
him
or
whether
you'll
let
him
have
a
--
have
it
available?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
it
there
looking
at
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
courts
had
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
harm
would
it
do
the
court
to
let
him
see
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)--
but
we
have
said
that
a
man
who
is
indigent
is
entitled
to
get
--
to
have
said
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
status
of
the
man
who
would
have
money
to
pay
for
a
record.
what
he
is
saying
as
i
understand
you
now
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
have
that
record
made
available
to
him
and
he
asked
the
court
for
it
and
they
wouldn't
let
him
have
it,
although
they
had
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
who
could
arrange
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
who
could
arrange
for
the
reproduction
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
means
if
he
didn't
have
the
money
to
do
it,
he
just
couldn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
be
the
question
to
me
from
what
you
tell
me?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
speaking
a
little
louder?
