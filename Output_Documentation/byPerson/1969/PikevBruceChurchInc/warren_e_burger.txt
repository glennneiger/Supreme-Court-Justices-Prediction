thank
you
mr.

mr.
abramson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
understand
this
argument
that
way.
i
understood
he
had
two
barrels
to
his
gun:
one,
to
get
credit
for
the
good
and
to
avoid
the
disadvantages
of
being
credited
with
the
bad
if
somebody
sold
bad
fruit
as
arizona
fruit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
the
sligh
case
certainly
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
was
very
much
to
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
there's
a
factual
difference
that
you
--
you
probably
can't
send
raspberries
in
a
bulk
in
truckloads.
you
got
to
have
them
in
small
containers
so
that
that
issue
wouldn't
come
up
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
that
what
arizona's
legislature
is
claiming
or
by
this
statute
claim
was
the
right
to
have
arizona
products
identified
as
such?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
how
you
can
generalize
that
way
on
the
state
of
this
record.
certainly,
there
are
housewives
who
go
into
stores
and
having
had
a
good
experience
of
favorable
experience
with
certain
types
of
fruit
or
other
merchandise
will
say
is
this
california
or
is
it
texas
or
is
it
arizona?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
each
of
those
states
has
an
important
interest
in
protecting
that,
do
they
not?
isn't
that
what
the
sligh
case
really
was
largely
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
about
and
turner
as
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
that
was
the
--
maybe
that's
what
the
record
supported,
but
the
court
seemed
to
go
beyond
that
because
this
court's
had
the
protection
of
the
state's
reputation
in
foreign
markets,
with
the
consequent
beneficial
effect
upon
the
great
home
industry
may
have
been
within
the
legislative
intent?
