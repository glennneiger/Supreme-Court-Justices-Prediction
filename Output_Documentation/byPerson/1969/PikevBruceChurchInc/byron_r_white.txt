justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
lee,
what's
--
tell
me,
you
cited
some
prior
case,
but
what
would
you
suppose
the
justification
is
for
states
saying
you
may
not
ship
in
bulk
out
of
the
state?
you
may
not
ship
in
bulk
out
of
the
state,
are
you
getting
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
if
the
fellow
you
say
that
--
he
says
“well
look,
i'm
going
to
ship
in
bulk
out
of
the
state.
it's
just
a
few
miles
across
the
line
and
i'm
going
to
pack
them
over
there
and
say
that
their
packed
in
california.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you're
not
going
to
hurt
if
they
are
bad
cantaloupes?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
won't
be
counted
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
has
to
be
the
sole
basis
for
them
for
more
preventing
bulk
shipments
where
they
are
not
going
to
be
identified
upon
being
packed
as
arizona
cantaloupes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so,
it's
again,
you
want
them
identified
as
arizona
cantaloupes,
and
add
it
up
and
arizona
will
get
credit
for
these,
they
are
bad,
you
don't
want
credit
for
them,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
do
you
have
a
regulation
that
state
says
how
far
you
may
transport
cantaloupes
and
picked
up
to
the
packing
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
that
--
how
far
they
are
normally
transported
when
they're
picked
up
in
the
field
--
i
suppose
that
you
defined,
but
maybe
they
are
carried
20
or
30
miles
within
the
state
of
arizona
to
a
packing
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
least
as
far
as
they're
carried
here
across
the
state
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
got
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
way
did
they
operate?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
are
they
higher
or
lower
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
of
the
california
inspectors
if
they
want
to
ship
these
cantaloupes
back
into
arizona
for
retail
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
suppose
you
--
i
suppose
you
have
regulations
against
to
check
on
the
quality
of
imported
cantaloupe?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
re-inspect
them
do
you
when
they
shipped
back
into
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
make
sure
you
would
accept
the
certificate
of
the
california
inspector
if
the
california
law
meets
what
you
think
is
a
reasonable
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
--
how
do
you
read
the
opinion
of
district
court?
did
it
say
that
these
regulations
weren't
authorized
by
the
state
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
implied
that,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
the
extent
that
it
did,
we
aren't
very
that
position
to
disagree
with
that,
are
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
state
was
the
administrator's
had
been
vague
and
unlawful.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
administer
the
law
for
a
long
period
of
years,
quite
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
grow
up
cantaloupe
on
the
blight
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
when
you
packed
at
arizona
cantaloupes
at
blight,
do
you
put
at
california
--
are
you
required
of
california
law
to
say
that
they
are
california
cantaloupes
or
just
that
they
are
packed
at
blight?
justice
byron
r.
white
packed
in
season?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
it
--
that's
the
label
that
you
put
on
to
your
blight's
pack,
arizona
cantaloupes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
say
arizona
because
they
aren't
packed
in
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
are
these
buyers?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
their
customers?
justice
byron
r.
