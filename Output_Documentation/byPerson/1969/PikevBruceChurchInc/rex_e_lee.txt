mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
presented
for
decision
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
certain
aspects
of
arizona's
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act.
once
again,
we
have
a
very
important
industry
and
a
very
important
statute
of
an
important
agricultural
state.
i
believe
that
the
issues
which
are
present
in
this
case
can
best
be
appreciated
against
the
background
on
a
brief
discussion
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
arizona's
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
and
the
history
of
standardization
act
in
general.
mr.
justice
brandeis
reminds
us
in
pacific
states
box
&
basket
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
standardization
act,
that
is
acts
which
prescribe
standards
for
certain
types
of
containers
of
agricultural
produced
are
among
the
earliest
examples
of
the
exercise
of
police
power
by
the
states.
the
case
that
mr.
justice
brandeis'
cites
as
authority
for
that
proposition
is
turner
versus
maryland
an
1883
unanimous
decision
by
this
court.
there
is
some
language
in
turner
versus
maryland
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
which
i
believe
definitely
warrants
the
attention
of
the
court
because
it
answers
specifically
one
of
the
propositions
or
one
of
the
contentions
that's
raised
by
the
appellee
in
his
brief.
citation
of
turner
versus
maryland
is
contained
in
our
brief,
it's
107
u.s.
38
and
this
particular
quote
appears
at
page
57.
in
that
case,
this
court
ruled
as
follows:
“the
state
may
direct
that
a
certain
product
while
it
remains
in
the
bosom
of
the
country
and
before
it
becomes
an
article
of
foreign
commerce
or
commerce
between
the
states,
shall
be
encased,
shall
be
encased
in
such
a
package
as
appears
best
fit
it
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
package
and
to
identify
its
contents
as
the
growth
of
the
state.”
so
that
as
early
as
1883,
this
court
in
the
unanimous
decision
required
that
it
lay
within
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
to
require
that
the
produce
of
that
state
prior
to
the
time
that
it
leaves
the
state,
be
encased
in
a
certain
type
of
package,
and
that
that
package
identify
the
produce
as
the
product
of
the
state.
involved
in
that
particular
case
was
a
standard
container
known
as
the
hogshead
or
maryland
tobacco,
and
that
statute
required
that
the
hogshead
identify
the
tobacco
contained
therein
is
maryland
tobacco.
the
arizona
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
rests
upon
consideration
similar
to
those
which
are
approved
by
this
court
in
turner
versus
maryland.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
a
discussion
of
the
conditions
which
led
up
to
the
enactment
of
the
standardization
act,
and
they
are
as
follows.
prior
to
1929
when
the
act
was
adopted,
it
was
up
to
each
individual
shipper
within
the
state
to
set
his
own
standards,
both
for
the
quality
of
the
produce
that
he
desired
to
ship,
and
the
type
of
container
that
he
desired
to
ship
it
in
if
he
shipped
it
in
a
container
at
all.
consequently,
the
standards
adopted
by
some
shippers
were
very
high,
and
the
standards
adopted
by
other
shippers
were
not
so
high.
it
is
abundantly
borne
out
by
this
record
that
it
is
of
prime
importance
to
the
success
of
marketing
of
fruits
and
vegetables
that
the
shipper
maintained
a
good
reputation
for
shipping
quality
of
fruit.
but
the
record
also
bears
out,
there's
not
always
possible
to
maintain
that
reputation
separate
and
apart
from
the
reputation
of
the
district
or
the
state
within
which
he
produces
and
from
which
he
ships
his
product,
particularly
where
it's
produced.
conversely
stated
if
a
state
can
acquire
a
good
reputation
for
a
certain
type
of
produce,
that
reputation
will
inure
to
the
benefit
not
only
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
but
also
each
individual
grower
and
shipper
within
that
state.
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
examples
where
a
states
have
been
successful
in
creating
such
reputation,
such
as
washington
apples,
florida
oranges,
arizona
grapefruit
and
frankly
we
believe
arizona
cantaloupes.
this
then
was
the
problem
for
it
which
the
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
was
directed.
it
set
minimum
standards
for
a
selected
number
of
fruits
and
vegetables,
now
37
within
the
state
of
arizona
and
those
standards
have
been
met
by
all
shippers
where
the
act
so
provided
and
it
also
provided
that
they
have
to
meet
minimum
standards
not
only
of
quality,
but
also
a
pack,
and
that
it
had
to
be
packed
in
standard
containers.
the
provisions
dealing
with
cantaloupes
as
they
appear
in
the
statute
today
are
illustrative
in
this
regard.
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
statute
is
cited,
the
relevant
provisions
are
cited
at
the
outset
of
our
brief,
the
cantaloupes
must
be
mature,
but
not
overripe.
they
have
to
be
free
from
mold,
decays,
sponginess,
welding,
insect
damage
and
a
variety
of
quality
defects,
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
provisions
of
the
statute
from
the
standpoint
of
this
case
are
those
provisions
which
deal
with
the
individual
pack
and
the
appearance
of
the
cantaloupes
within
that
pack.
it's
been
stipulated
by
the
parties
that
a
prime
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
avoid
deceptive
packs
or
a
deceptive
arrangement,
deceptive
arrangement
and
deceptive
pack
are
described
similarly
by
the
statute.
they
pertain
to
that
situation
wherein
the
higher
quality
fruit
is
placed
toward
the
outside
of
the
container
with
the
off
quality
fruit
in
the
center
of
the
container
of
the
lesser
quality
fruit
in
the
center
cover,
so
as
to
materially
misrepresent
the
quality
of
the
entire
container.
that
particular
provision
of
course
can
only
be
enforced
if
the
container
itself
after
it
has
been
packed,
has
been
inspected,
and
there
are
other
provisions
as
to
which
this
is
also
true.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
white
lies
the
entire
justification
of
the
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
number
of
answers
to
that
question.
they
are
the
following;
in
the
first
place,
if
they
are
packed
in
california,
they
will
not
be
identified
as
arizona
produce.
this
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
are.
there
are
three
principle
cantaloupe
producing
states.
they
are
arizona,
california
and
texas.
there
is
some
value
or
at
least
it
certainly
lies
within
the
state's
prerogative
to
conclude
that
there
is
some
value
to
be
known
as
the
number
three
cantaloupe
producing
state
within
the
united
states.
if
these
cantaloupes
are
not
identified
as
arizona
produce
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
they
won't
be
counted,
that
is
correct.
moreover,
these
particular
cantaloupes,
and
this
is
in
the
record
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
i
submit
that
it
is
not,
there
are
additional
reasons.
these
particular
cantaloupes,
these
particular
cantaloupes
are
as
a
matter
of
stipulation,
as
a
matter
of
stipulation
in
the
record
the
highest
quality
of
any
cantaloupes
that
are
produced
within
the
state
of
arizona
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
have
those
cantaloupes
identified
as
arizona
cantaloupes.
this
is
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
pursuant
to
that,
let
me
proceed
with
the
example
that
you
gave
of
cantaloupes
which
are
shipped
in
bulk
across
the
state
line.
they
come
from
the
field
and
they're
put
in
to
a
trailer,
everything
goes
into
the
trailer.
the
good
fruit,
the
bad
fruit,
it's
mixed
all
up
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
possible.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
think
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
point
that
i'm
about
to
be
make
is
that
they
can
be
carried
a
good
deal
farther.
they
go
in
and
there
has
been
no
sorting,
no
sorting
of
quality
fruit
from
the
colors,
no
sorting
of
one
color
from
another
color,
and
this
as
is
borne
out
by
the
record
is
also
important.
there
is
no
sorting
according
to
variety,
everything
goes
into
that
trailer.
they
are
inspected,
but
they
are
inspected
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
presence
of
pickle
worm,
which
is
a
quality
defect
of
cantaloupes.
they
are
given
a
pickle
worm
certificate,
indicating
that
they
have
been
determined
to
be
free
of
pickle
worm,
and
that's
certificate
is
given
to
the
california
inspector
on
the
california
side
of
the
line.
and
from
that
point,
provided
that
they
meet
the
test,
they
go
right
on
through
the
inspection
station,
presumably
on
their
way
to
blight
to
be
packed.
but
mr.
justice
white,
once
those
cantaloupes
leave
the
state
of
arizona,
there
is
no
way
that
we
have
of
assuring
ourselves
that
they
will
not
go
right
on
through
blight,
right
on
to
san
diego,
los
angeles,
san
francisco
or
anywhere
else,
be
sold
in
bulk
lot
to
a
chain
store
buyer
and
when
asked
where
that
these
cantaloupes
come
from,
the
answer
comes
back
parker,
arizona.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
frankly
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
are
and
those
are
set
forth,
they're
discussed
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
feel
--
there
are,
--
you
know,
that
---
though
the
differences
in
language
of
the
statute
would
indicate
that
arizona
standards
are
more
demanding
than
california
standards.
for
example
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none
mr.
justice
marshall.
our
interest
just
as
in
the
case
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
just
as
this
court
said
in
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
the
state
of
florida
has
a
great
interest
in
protecting
reputation
of
its
citrus
fruits.
the
california
statute
says
that
both
california
and
arizona
proscribe
serious
defects,
and
both
california
and
arizona
says
that
it's
a
serious
defect
if
it
affects
the
edible
portion
of
the
cantaloupe.
the
california
statute
stops
at
that
point.
the
arizona
statute
goes
on
to
say
or
if
it
affects
the
appearance,
the
california
says
nothing
about
it,
or
the
shipping
quality
of
the
fruit
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
these
manners
of
appearance
and
shipping
quality
are
factors
which
affect
the
reputation
of
the
produce
but
are
separate
apart
the
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
certificate,
but
what?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
arizona
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
sure
that
we
wouldn't.
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
i
know
of
no
such
certificate,
but
that's
beside
the
point
if
there
were
one.
the
point
is
this,
why
would
suppose
that
fully
90%
of
cantaloupes
that
are
grown
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
not
marketed
in
the
state
of
arizona?
arizona
is
cantaloupe
producing
state.
it's
consumption
doesn't
anywhere
near
match
its
production.
what
we're
concerned
about
is
the
reputation
and
preserving
the
reputation
that
our
produce
has
in
other
states
where
they
are
in
fact
consumed.
now,
mr.
abramson
will
tell
you
that
they
fully
intent
to
pack
it
in
blight
according
to
california
standards.
we
feel
that
california
standards
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
arizona's,
and
therefore
bound
and
in
any
event,
we
feel
that
it
follows
inexorably
from
the
proposition
that
arizona
has
the
right
to
enact
the
standardization
law
that
it
can
enforce
them
through
its
own
inspection
officers
and
need
not
rely
upon
the
application
of
california
law
through
california
officers.
let's
assume
that
the
standards
were
exactly
the
same
today?
we
have
no
guarantee
that
those
standards
are
going
to
be
carried
out.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
california
will
not
change
his
law
tomorrow.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
california
inspection
officers
are
going
to
do
their
job
and
indeed,
there
is
some
difference;
you
can
read
it
in
the
statute.
if
a
5%
difference
will
make
our
statute
unconstitutional,
would
a
10%
difference
--
than
validate
it.
at
all
points,
the
conclusion
is
simply
inevitable
that
starting
from
the
premise
which
we
feel
is
justified
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
turner
versus
maryland,
sligh
versus
kirkwood
and
the
pacific
states
case
that
we
do
have
the
right
to
prescribe
the
standard
containers,
and
we
have
the
right
to
enforce
it
through
our
own
inspection
officers.
now,
the
bruce
church
co.
has
said
we
intend
to
pack
these
in
california.
they
articulated
some
of
the
reasons
that
there's
a
problem
with
this.
even
assuming
that
that
is
correct,
if
this
appellee
allowed
to
ship
them
across
the
state
line
in
violation
of
the
statute,
we're
going
to
have
to
let
others
and
we
have
no
control
over
how
those
will
be
sold
or
whether
they
will
be
packed
in
standard
containers
at
all.
the
only
way
that
we
can
assure
that
is
to
assure
--
is
to
require
that
before
the
produce
leaves
the
state,
it
is
packed
neatly
in
a
new
clean
container,
arranged
orderly,
uniform
in
size,
uniform
in
color,
uniform
in
variety.
so
that
when
the
grocer
opens
that
box,
he
knows
that
he
can
take
the
cantaloupes
out
of
their
box,
put
them
on
the
shelf
and
they
will
make
a
nice,
neat,
attractive
assortment,
uniform
in
color,
uniform
in
size,
and
up
to
quality
that
is
guaranteed
by
the
arizona
standardization
act,
and
that
is
what
is
meant
by
standardization,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
preserve.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
burger
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--
this
record
does
not
show
anything
on
that,
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
individual
choice
with
the
grocer.
he
either
might
or
he
might
not,
but
we
think
--
you
see,
he
is
our
customer,
and
so
are
the
merchants
--
they're
not
merchants,
the
jobbers
and
the
wholesalers,
and
they
know
that
they
can
depend
on
the
stamp
on
the
outside
of
these
containers,
arizona
produce
as
meaning
something
because
it
has
been
packed
according
to
the
arizona
standards.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
with
the
great
difficultly
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
certainly
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
know
what
you
referring
to
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
these
provisions
that
say
that
under
normal
circumstances,
you
give
certain
amount
of
difference
to
the
district
court.
but,
i
would
submit
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
submit
that
under
circumstances
such
as
this,
there
simply
is
no
way
that
you
can
read
the
statute
any
other
way.
the
cantaloupe
statute
in
its
present
form
says
that
all
cantaloupes
shall
be
packed
in
close
standard
containers
approved
by
the
supervisor.
i
just
can't
read
that
to
say
anything
else
than
all
cantaloupes
shall
be
packed
in
close
standard
containers
approved
by
the
supervisor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
i
learned
my
lesson
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
--
yes
that
is
correct,
there
were
individual
instances
in
which
the
administrator
for
not
obeying
the
law.
mr.
justice
white,
the
last
time
i
was
before
the
court,
i
learned
that
that
particular
principle
does
not
invalidate
a
statute,
and
we
have
cited
lassen
versus
the
state
of
arizona
on
that
very
point.
that
time,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
were
co-counsel
in
that
case,
and
i
think
that
has
been
adequately
covered
in
our
brief.
mr.
pike
knows
that
he
did
wrong.
that
maybe
a
matter
of
concern
for
the
officials
of
the
state
of
arizona,
but
it
is
not
something
that
makes
the
statute
unconstitutional.
i
do
want
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
understand
that
you
still
give
me
about
five
minutes.
i
like
to
treat
just
briefly
the
basic
rules
of
law
that
had
been
laid
down
by
this
court
which
are
determinative
on
this
issue.
one
of
them
has
already
been
mentioned
in
the
case
that
was
argued
before
us,
and
that
is
that
the
judicial
function
in
applying
the
commerce
clause
to
statutes
which
are
checked
as
allegedly
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
is
a
very
limited
one.
the
case
of
south
carolina
versus
barnwell
brothers
clarified
once
and
for
all
that
the
test
under
the
commerce
clause
is
the
same
as
it
is
under
a
substantive
due
process.
and
that
under
that
test,
the
judicial
inquiry
stops
with
a
two-pronged
inquiry:
number
one,
is
there
a
legitimate
state
objective,
and
number
two,
is
the
state
regulation
reasonably
anticipated
to
carry
out
that
objective?
we
submit
that
under
other
decisions
of
this
court,
both
of
those
requirements
are
clearly
satisfied.
you
have
sligh
versus
kirkwood
which
is
discussed
extensively
in
our
brief.
that's
the
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
florida
statute
prohibiting
the
sale
of
immature
or
citrus
or
citrus
which
is
otherwise
unfit
for
human
consumption.
now,
the
appellee
has
taken
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
turner
versus
maryland.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
but
it
slips
in
there
--
look
on
page
31.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
cited
in
mr.
justice
brandies'
opinion
of
pacific
states
box
&
basket
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
should
--
upon
--
after
seeing
the
appellee's
brief
and
reconsidering;
i
concluded
we
should
have
given
it
--
that
we
gave
it
too
short
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
these
three
cases,
i
submit
to
the
court
clearly
established
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state,
and
that's
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
the
state
does
have,
the
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
reputation
of
its
fruits
and
vegetables
by
setting
these
standards
of
quality
and
of
pack.
now,
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
the
dispositive
issue
in
the
case
is
this,
it
rises
in
this
fashion.
the
appellee
as
i
read
his
brief
agrees,
demand
on
certain
circumstances
be
a
legitimate
interest
enforcing
standardization,
but
he
says
that
there
is
a
qualifying
consideration
in
this
case
because
in
the
context
of
cantaloupes;
they
can't
be
packed
except
in
a
packing
shed
and
we
agree
that
under
present
technology,
they
can't.
therefore,
in
the
appellee's
view,
this
case
comes
within
those
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
said
that
where
it
is
the
sole
objective
of
the
statute
to
require
packing
to
be
accomplished
in
the
state
that
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
[inaudible]
polar
ice
cream
versus
andrews
and
so
forth.
and
the
appellee
takes
one
more
step
as
indeed
he
must,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
statute
is
the
same
and
that
is
to
preserve
the
packing
business
for
the
state.
so
that
really,
the
ultimate
issue,
the
dispositive
issue
between
these
two
parties
is
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
is
it
the
statute,
is
it
the
purpose
which
has
been
testified
to
on
this
record?
is
it
the
purpose
that
is
set
forth
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute
itself?
is
it
the
purpose
that
is
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
pacific
states
and
turner
versus
maryland,
or
is
it
a
purpose
which
will
make
it
invalid?
once
the
case
is
viewed
in
that
fashion,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
answer
is
very
clear,
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
that
it
will
not
re-examine
the
wisdom
of
the
state
legislative
determination.
and
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
proper
purpose
that
this
purpose
will
be
assumed
to
be
the
purpose
on
which
the
state
legislature
rely.
i
need
not
recant
those
cases
at
this
time.
they're
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
i
believe
that
they
adequately
dispose
of
this
contention.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
your
honor.
significant
contention
raised
by
mr.
abramson,
and
this
of
course
is
been
at
the
heart
of
disposition
throughout
this
entire
litigation,
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
require
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
simply
assert
that
is
not
the
purpose
and
under
the
well
established
rules
of
statutory
construction
in
constitutional
cases
is
set
forth
on
page
34
to
39
of
our
brief.
court
simply
don't
ascribe
improper
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
statute
nowhere
says
anything
about
a
packing
shed.
i
would
point
to
the
court
that
this
statute
deals
with
37
different
products;
37
different
products,
only
one
of
which
is
cantaloupes.
most
of
them
don't
have
to
be
packed
in
the
packing
shed.
most
of
them
can
be
packed
in
the
field,
and
we
can
inspect
them
there,
and
that's
fine.
the
concern
of
the
statute
is
not
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state,
the
concern
of
the
statute
is
that
we
be
able
to
inspect
it
in
the
pack
in
order
to
determine
that
the
statutory
standards
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
that
is
correct.
so
the
question
is,
where
does
it
fall?
is
it
the
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
turner
versus
maryland
case,
or
is
it
a
heidell
case?
and
i
would
simply
point
out
that
in
heidell,
this
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
other
possible
reasons
for
the
requirement
that
--
a
packing
within
the
state
other
than
the
sole
requirement
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
packing
business
for
themselves.
were
that
the
case
in
this
statute,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
lettuce,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
asparagus,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
colliflower
and
the
whole
gamut
products,
it
is
not.
there
is
no
requirement.
the
only
reason
that
they
have
to
pack
in
the
state
is
because
they
--
that
they
have
to
build
a
packing
shed
is
that
they
cannot
pack
except
in
the
packing
shed.
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
if
they
want
to
pack
underneath
the
shade
tree,
that's
fine,
we
can
then
carry
out
the
inspection
responsibilities
with
which
mr.
pike
is
charged
under
the
statute.
now,
with
regard
to
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
i
simply
thoroughly
disagree
that
that
was
a
--
a
health
and
safety
measure.
i
need
not
re-read
the
language
that
the
chief
justice
has
read.
that
language
is
significant
to
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
points
out
that
it
is
a
proper
purpose
to
be
concern
with
the
state's
reputation
in
interstate
commerce,
and
secondly,
it
points
out
that
as
long
as
that
could
have
been
the
legislative
purpose,
then
the
statute
will
be
upheld.
mr.
abramson
as
i
understand
his
comments,
agreed
that
turner
versus
maryland
was
against
him,
but
argues
that
is
too
old
and
therefore,
the
court
ought
not
to
follow
it.
mr.
justice
stewart,
so
that
you
don't
think
that
i'm
totally
incompetent
in
having
missed
it
the
first
time
around,
let
me
point
out
that
the
language
that
i
found
which
thoroughly
resolves
this
comes
at
the
end
of
a
very
long,
long
opinion
in
order
to
save
you
the
same
problem.
might
i
point
out
that
is
at
page
57
of
the
united
states
reports.
finally
and
in
conclusion
and
i
won't
need
to
use
my
seven
minutes,
this
is
an
economic
regulation.
it's
a
regulation
imposed
by
a
state
pursuant
to
its
police
powers,
and
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear,
starting
at
nebbia
versus
new
york
that
there
is
a
heavy
burden
which
rests
upon
those
individuals
who
seek
to
upset
that
police
power
regulation
on
the
ground
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
federal
statute
with
which
this
is
inconsistent,
certainly
under
this
court's
decision
in
paul
and
so
forth.
on
conclusion,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
never
on
these
grounds
your
honor.
the
–
there
have
been
probably
half
a
dozen
at
the
outside,
pieces
of
litigation
involving
these
statutes
and
most
of
them
have
involved
bonds
that
the
shippers
had
put
up
and
--
nothing
of
this
magnitude.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none
of
the
issues
involved
here
have
ever
been
passed
upon
--
have
even
been
passed
upon
by
a
state
court.
it
is
agreed
on
all
sides
supported
by
the
record,
supported
by
square
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
a
legitimate
interest,
so
long
as
these
fruits
and
vegetables
remain
in
the
language
of
this
court
within
the
bosom
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
requiring
that
they
be
packed
according
to
the
standards
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
prescribed.
once
you
start
from
that
premise,
it
is
simply
inevitable
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
enforce
those
standards
according
to
its
own
inspection
officers.
the
statutory
standards
necessarily
involve
manners
of
judgment.
material
misrepresentation
of
the
entire
quantity,
uniformity
of
quality,
uniformity
of
size,
uniformity
of
color,
these
are
judgment
matters.
we
submit
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
have
these
judgment
matters
resolved
by
the
judgment
of
its
own
inspection
officers
and
not
inspection
officers
of
someone
else
outside
the
state.
in
conclusion,
when
this
first
came
up,
mr.
pike
came
to
me
and
said
well
now,
what
is
this
law,
this
federal
law
that
our
law
violates?
and
i
said
well
mr.
pike,
it's
the
constitution
and
he
said
well,
it's
written
in
english
isn't
it?
can
i
read
it?
and
i
said
well
mr.
pike,
the
constitutions,
you
have
to
understand,
have
a
wealth
of
decisions
behind
him.
and
then
he
said
nevertheless,
it's
written
in
english,
let
me
see
it.
i
showed
to
him
and
he
said
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
he
said
has
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
we
can't
have
a
standardization
act
in
arizona?
i
of
course,
replied
that
congress
had
not
passed
such
a
law.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
because
i'm
sure
this
court
well
knows,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation,
the
judicial
function
is
a
narrow
one,
and
we
submit
that
this
case
clearly
falls
within
the
bounds
of
legitimate
exercise
of
state
police
power
and
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
presented
for
decision
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
certain
aspects
of
arizona's
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act.
once
again,
we
have
a
very
important
industry
and
a
very
important
statute
of
an
important
agricultural
state.
i
believe
that
the
issues
which
are
present
in
this
case
can
best
be
appreciated
against
the
background
on
a
brief
discussion
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
arizona's
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
and
the
history
of
standardization
act
in
general.
mr.
justice
brandeis
reminds
us
in
pacific
states
box
&
basket
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
standardization
act,
that
is
acts
which
prescribe
standards
for
certain
types
of
containers
of
agricultural
produced
are
among
the
earliest
examples
of
the
exercise
of
police
power
by
the
states.
the
case
that
mr.
justice
brandeis'
cites
as
authority
for
that
proposition
is
turner
versus
maryland
an
1883
unanimous
decision
by
this
court.
there
is
some
language
in
turner
versus
maryland
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
but
which
i
believe
definitely
warrants
the
attention
of
the
court
because
it
answers
specifically
one
of
the
propositions
or
one
of
the
contentions
that's
raised
by
the
appellee
in
his
brief.
citation
of
turner
versus
maryland
is
contained
in
our
brief,
it's
107
u.s.
38
and
this
particular
quote
appears
at
page
57.
in
that
case,
this
court
ruled
as
follows:
“the
state
may
direct
that
a
certain
product
while
it
remains
in
the
bosom
of
the
country
and
before
it
becomes
an
article
of
foreign
commerce
or
commerce
between
the
states,
shall
be
encased,
shall
be
encased
in
such
a
package
as
appears
best
fit
it
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
package
and
to
identify
its
contents
as
the
growth
of
the
state.”
so
that
as
early
as
1883,
this
court
in
the
unanimous
decision
required
that
it
lay
within
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
to
require
that
the
produce
of
that
state
prior
to
the
time
that
it
leaves
the
state,
be
encased
in
a
certain
type
of
package,
and
that
that
package
identify
the
produce
as
the
product
of
the
state.
involved
in
that
particular
case
was
a
standard
container
known
as
the
hogshead
or
maryland
tobacco,
and
that
statute
required
that
the
hogshead
identify
the
tobacco
contained
therein
is
maryland
tobacco.
the
arizona
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
rests
upon
consideration
similar
to
those
which
are
approved
by
this
court
in
turner
versus
maryland.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
a
discussion
of
the
conditions
which
led
up
to
the
enactment
of
the
standardization
act,
and
they
are
as
follows.
prior
to
1929
when
the
act
was
adopted,
it
was
up
to
each
individual
shipper
within
the
state
to
set
his
own
standards,
both
for
the
quality
of
the
produce
that
he
desired
to
ship,
and
the
type
of
container
that
he
desired
to
ship
it
in
if
he
shipped
it
in
a
container
at
all.
consequently,
the
standards
adopted
by
some
shippers
were
very
high,
and
the
standards
adopted
by
other
shippers
were
not
so
high.
it
is
abundantly
borne
out
by
this
record
that
it
is
of
prime
importance
to
the
success
of
marketing
of
fruits
and
vegetables
that
the
shipper
maintained
a
good
reputation
for
shipping
quality
of
fruit.
but
the
record
also
bears
out,
there's
not
always
possible
to
maintain
that
reputation
separate
and
apart
from
the
reputation
of
the
district
or
the
state
within
which
he
produces
and
from
which
he
ships
his
product,
particularly
where
it's
produced.
conversely
stated
if
a
state
can
acquire
a
good
reputation
for
a
certain
type
of
produce,
that
reputation
will
inure
to
the
benefit
not
only
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
but
also
each
individual
grower
and
shipper
within
that
state.
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
examples
where
a
states
have
been
successful
in
creating
such
reputation,
such
as
washington
apples,
florida
oranges,
arizona
grapefruit
and
frankly
we
believe
arizona
cantaloupes.
this
then
was
the
problem
for
it
which
the
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act
was
directed.
it
set
minimum
standards
for
a
selected
number
of
fruits
and
vegetables,
now
37
within
the
state
of
arizona
and
those
standards
have
been
met
by
all
shippers
where
the
act
so
provided
and
it
also
provided
that
they
have
to
meet
minimum
standards
not
only
of
quality,
but
also
a
pack,
and
that
it
had
to
be
packed
in
standard
containers.
the
provisions
dealing
with
cantaloupes
as
they
appear
in
the
statute
today
are
illustrative
in
this
regard.
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
statute
is
cited,
the
relevant
provisions
are
cited
at
the
outset
of
our
brief,
the
cantaloupes
must
be
mature,
but
not
overripe.
they
have
to
be
free
from
mold,
decays,
sponginess,
welding,
insect
damage
and
a
variety
of
quality
defects,
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
provisions
of
the
statute
from
the
standpoint
of
this
case
are
those
provisions
which
deal
with
the
individual
pack
and
the
appearance
of
the
cantaloupes
within
that
pack.
it's
been
stipulated
by
the
parties
that
a
prime
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
avoid
deceptive
packs
or
a
deceptive
arrangement,
deceptive
arrangement
and
deceptive
pack
are
described
similarly
by
the
statute.
they
pertain
to
that
situation
wherein
the
higher
quality
fruit
is
placed
toward
the
outside
of
the
container
with
the
off
quality
fruit
in
the
center
of
the
container
of
the
lesser
quality
fruit
in
the
center
cover,
so
as
to
materially
misrepresent
the
quality
of
the
entire
container.
that
particular
provision
of
course
can
only
be
enforced
if
the
container
itself
after
it
has
been
packed,
has
been
inspected,
and
there
are
other
provisions
as
to
which
this
is
also
true.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
white
lies
the
entire
justification
of
the
fruit
and
vegetable
standardization
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
number
of
answers
to
that
question.
they
are
the
following;
in
the
first
place,
if
they
are
packed
in
california,
they
will
not
be
identified
as
arizona
produce.
this
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
we
are.
there
are
three
principle
cantaloupe
producing
states.
they
are
arizona,
california
and
texas.
there
is
some
value
or
at
least
it
certainly
lies
within
the
state's
prerogative
to
conclude
that
there
is
some
value
to
be
known
as
the
number
three
cantaloupe
producing
state
within
the
united
states.
if
these
cantaloupes
are
not
identified
as
arizona
produce
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
they
won't
be
counted,
that
is
correct.
moreover,
these
particular
cantaloupes,
and
this
is
in
the
record
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir,
i
submit
that
it
is
not,
there
are
additional
reasons.
these
particular
cantaloupes,
these
particular
cantaloupes
are
as
a
matter
of
stipulation,
as
a
matter
of
stipulation
in
the
record
the
highest
quality
of
any
cantaloupes
that
are
produced
within
the
state
of
arizona
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
have
those
cantaloupes
identified
as
arizona
cantaloupes.
this
is
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
pursuant
to
that,
let
me
proceed
with
the
example
that
you
gave
of
cantaloupes
which
are
shipped
in
bulk
across
the
state
line.
they
come
from
the
field
and
they're
put
in
to
a
trailer,
everything
goes
into
the
trailer.
the
good
fruit,
the
bad
fruit,
it's
mixed
all
up
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
possible.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
think
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
point
that
i'm
about
to
be
make
is
that
they
can
be
carried
a
good
deal
farther.
they
go
in
and
there
has
been
no
sorting,
no
sorting
of
quality
fruit
from
the
colors,
no
sorting
of
one
color
from
another
color,
and
this
as
is
borne
out
by
the
record
is
also
important.
there
is
no
sorting
according
to
variety,
everything
goes
into
that
trailer.
they
are
inspected,
but
they
are
inspected
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
presence
of
pickle
worm,
which
is
a
quality
defect
of
cantaloupes.
they
are
given
a
pickle
worm
certificate,
indicating
that
they
have
been
determined
to
be
free
of
pickle
worm,
and
that's
certificate
is
given
to
the
california
inspector
on
the
california
side
of
the
line.
and
from
that
point,
provided
that
they
meet
the
test,
they
go
right
on
through
the
inspection
station,
presumably
on
their
way
to
blight
to
be
packed.
but
mr.
justice
white,
once
those
cantaloupes
leave
the
state
of
arizona,
there
is
no
way
that
we
have
of
assuring
ourselves
that
they
will
not
go
right
on
through
blight,
right
on
to
san
diego,
los
angeles,
san
francisco
or
anywhere
else,
be
sold
in
bulk
lot
to
a
chain
store
buyer
and
when
asked
where
that
these
cantaloupes
come
from,
the
answer
comes
back
parker,
arizona.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
frankly
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
are
and
those
are
set
forth,
they're
discussed
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
feel
--
there
are,
--
you
know,
that
---
though
the
differences
in
language
of
the
statute
would
indicate
that
arizona
standards
are
more
demanding
than
california
standards.
for
example
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none
mr.
justice
marshall.
our
interest
just
as
in
the
case
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
just
as
this
court
said
in
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
the
state
of
florida
has
a
great
interest
in
protecting
reputation
of
its
citrus
fruits.
the
california
statute
says
that
both
california
and
arizona
proscribe
serious
defects,
and
both
california
and
arizona
says
that
it's
a
serious
defect
if
it
affects
the
edible
portion
of
the
cantaloupe.
the
california
statute
stops
at
that
point.
the
arizona
statute
goes
on
to
say
or
if
it
affects
the
appearance,
the
california
says
nothing
about
it,
or
the
shipping
quality
of
the
fruit
and
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
these
manners
of
appearance
and
shipping
quality
are
factors
which
affect
the
reputation
of
the
produce
but
are
separate
apart
the
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
certificate,
but
what?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
but
arizona
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
sure
that
we
wouldn't.
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
i
know
of
no
such
certificate,
but
that's
beside
the
point
if
there
were
one.
the
point
is
this,
why
would
suppose
that
fully
90%
of
cantaloupes
that
are
grown
in
the
state
of
arizona
are
not
marketed
in
the
state
of
arizona?
arizona
is
cantaloupe
producing
state.
it's
consumption
doesn't
anywhere
near
match
its
production.
what
we're
concerned
about
is
the
reputation
and
preserving
the
reputation
that
our
produce
has
in
other
states
where
they
are
in
fact
consumed.
now,
mr.
abramson
will
tell
you
that
they
fully
intent
to
pack
it
in
blight
according
to
california
standards.
we
feel
that
california
standards
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
arizona's,
and
therefore
bound
and
in
any
event,
we
feel
that
it
follows
inexorably
from
the
proposition
that
arizona
has
the
right
to
enact
the
standardization
law
that
it
can
enforce
them
through
its
own
inspection
officers
and
need
not
rely
upon
the
application
of
california
law
through
california
officers.
let's
assume
that
the
standards
were
exactly
the
same
today?
we
have
no
guarantee
that
those
standards
are
going
to
be
carried
out.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
california
will
not
change
his
law
tomorrow.
we
have
no
guarantee
that
california
inspection
officers
are
going
to
do
their
job
and
indeed,
there
is
some
difference;
you
can
read
it
in
the
statute.
if
a
5%
difference
will
make
our
statute
unconstitutional,
would
a
10%
difference
--
than
validate
it.
at
all
points,
the
conclusion
is
simply
inevitable
that
starting
from
the
premise
which
we
feel
is
justified
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
turner
versus
maryland,
sligh
versus
kirkwood
and
the
pacific
states
case
that
we
do
have
the
right
to
prescribe
the
standard
containers,
and
we
have
the
right
to
enforce
it
through
our
own
inspection
officers.
now,
the
bruce
church
co.
has
said
we
intend
to
pack
these
in
california.
they
articulated
some
of
the
reasons
that
there's
a
problem
with
this.
even
assuming
that
that
is
correct,
if
this
appellee
allowed
to
ship
them
across
the
state
line
in
violation
of
the
statute,
we're
going
to
have
to
let
others
and
we
have
no
control
over
how
those
will
be
sold
or
whether
they
will
be
packed
in
standard
containers
at
all.
the
only
way
that
we
can
assure
that
is
to
assure
--
is
to
require
that
before
the
produce
leaves
the
state,
it
is
packed
neatly
in
a
new
clean
container,
arranged
orderly,
uniform
in
size,
uniform
in
color,
uniform
in
variety.
so
that
when
the
grocer
opens
that
box,
he
knows
that
he
can
take
the
cantaloupes
out
of
their
box,
put
them
on
the
shelf
and
they
will
make
a
nice,
neat,
attractive
assortment,
uniform
in
color,
uniform
in
size,
and
up
to
quality
that
is
guaranteed
by
the
arizona
standardization
act,
and
that
is
what
is
meant
by
standardization,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
preserve.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
burger
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--
this
record
does
not
show
anything
on
that,
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
individual
choice
with
the
grocer.
he
either
might
or
he
might
not,
but
we
think
--
you
see,
he
is
our
customer,
and
so
are
the
merchants
--
they're
not
merchants,
the
jobbers
and
the
wholesalers,
and
they
know
that
they
can
depend
on
the
stamp
on
the
outside
of
these
containers,
arizona
produce
as
meaning
something
because
it
has
been
packed
according
to
the
arizona
standards.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
with
the
great
difficultly
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
certainly
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
know
what
you
referring
to
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
these
provisions
that
say
that
under
normal
circumstances,
you
give
certain
amount
of
difference
to
the
district
court.
but,
i
would
submit
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
submit
that
under
circumstances
such
as
this,
there
simply
is
no
way
that
you
can
read
the
statute
any
other
way.
the
cantaloupe
statute
in
its
present
form
says
that
all
cantaloupes
shall
be
packed
in
close
standard
containers
approved
by
the
supervisor.
i
just
can't
read
that
to
say
anything
else
than
all
cantaloupes
shall
be
packed
in
close
standard
containers
approved
by
the
supervisor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
i
learned
my
lesson
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
--
yes
that
is
correct,
there
were
individual
instances
in
which
the
administrator
for
not
obeying
the
law.
mr.
justice
white,
the
last
time
i
was
before
the
court,
i
learned
that
that
particular
principle
does
not
invalidate
a
statute,
and
we
have
cited
lassen
versus
the
state
of
arizona
on
that
very
point.
that
time,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
were
co-counsel
in
that
case,
and
i
think
that
has
been
adequately
covered
in
our
brief.
mr.
pike
knows
that
he
did
wrong.
that
maybe
a
matter
of
concern
for
the
officials
of
the
state
of
arizona,
but
it
is
not
something
that
makes
the
statute
unconstitutional.
i
do
want
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
understand
that
you
still
give
me
about
five
minutes.
i
like
to
treat
just
briefly
the
basic
rules
of
law
that
had
been
laid
down
by
this
court
which
are
determinative
on
this
issue.
one
of
them
has
already
been
mentioned
in
the
case
that
was
argued
before
us,
and
that
is
that
the
judicial
function
in
applying
the
commerce
clause
to
statutes
which
are
checked
as
allegedly
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
is
a
very
limited
one.
the
case
of
south
carolina
versus
barnwell
brothers
clarified
once
and
for
all
that
the
test
under
the
commerce
clause
is
the
same
as
it
is
under
a
substantive
due
process.
and
that
under
that
test,
the
judicial
inquiry
stops
with
a
two-pronged
inquiry:
number
one,
is
there
a
legitimate
state
objective,
and
number
two,
is
the
state
regulation
reasonably
anticipated
to
carry
out
that
objective?
we
submit
that
under
other
decisions
of
this
court,
both
of
those
requirements
are
clearly
satisfied.
you
have
sligh
versus
kirkwood
which
is
discussed
extensively
in
our
brief.
that's
the
case
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
florida
statute
prohibiting
the
sale
of
immature
or
citrus
or
citrus
which
is
otherwise
unfit
for
human
consumption.
now,
the
appellee
has
taken
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
turner
versus
maryland.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
but
it
slips
in
there
--
look
on
page
31.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
cited
in
mr.
justice
brandies'
opinion
of
pacific
states
box
&
basket
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
should
--
upon
--
after
seeing
the
appellee's
brief
and
reconsidering;
i
concluded
we
should
have
given
it
--
that
we
gave
it
too
short
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
these
three
cases,
i
submit
to
the
court
clearly
established
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state,
and
that's
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
the
state
does
have,
the
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
reputation
of
its
fruits
and
vegetables
by
setting
these
standards
of
quality
and
of
pack.
now,
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
the
dispositive
issue
in
the
case
is
this,
it
rises
in
this
fashion.
the
appellee
as
i
read
his
brief
agrees,
demand
on
certain
circumstances
be
a
legitimate
interest
enforcing
standardization,
but
he
says
that
there
is
a
qualifying
consideration
in
this
case
because
in
the
context
of
cantaloupes;
they
can't
be
packed
except
in
a
packing
shed
and
we
agree
that
under
present
technology,
they
can't.
therefore,
in
the
appellee's
view,
this
case
comes
within
those
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
said
that
where
it
is
the
sole
objective
of
the
statute
to
require
packing
to
be
accomplished
in
the
state
that
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
[inaudible]
polar
ice
cream
versus
andrews
and
so
forth.
and
the
appellee
takes
one
more
step
as
indeed
he
must,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
statute
is
the
same
and
that
is
to
preserve
the
packing
business
for
the
state.
so
that
really,
the
ultimate
issue,
the
dispositive
issue
between
these
two
parties
is
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
is
it
the
statute,
is
it
the
purpose
which
has
been
testified
to
on
this
record?
is
it
the
purpose
that
is
set
forth
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute
itself?
is
it
the
purpose
that
is
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
pacific
states
and
turner
versus
maryland,
or
is
it
a
purpose
which
will
make
it
invalid?
once
the
case
is
viewed
in
that
fashion,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
answer
is
very
clear,
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
that
it
will
not
re-examine
the
wisdom
of
the
state
legislative
determination.
and
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
proper
purpose
that
this
purpose
will
be
assumed
to
be
the
purpose
on
which
the
state
legislature
rely.
i
need
not
recant
those
cases
at
this
time.
they're
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
i
believe
that
they
adequately
dispose
of
this
contention.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
your
honor.
significant
contention
raised
by
mr.
abramson,
and
this
of
course
is
been
at
the
heart
of
disposition
throughout
this
entire
litigation,
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
require
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
simply
assert
that
is
not
the
purpose
and
under
the
well
established
rules
of
statutory
construction
in
constitutional
cases
is
set
forth
on
page
34
to
39
of
our
brief.
court
simply
don't
ascribe
improper
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
statute
nowhere
says
anything
about
a
packing
shed.
i
would
point
to
the
court
that
this
statute
deals
with
37
different
products;
37
different
products,
only
one
of
which
is
cantaloupes.
most
of
them
don't
have
to
be
packed
in
the
packing
shed.
most
of
them
can
be
packed
in
the
field,
and
we
can
inspect
them
there,
and
that's
fine.
the
concern
of
the
statute
is
not
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state,
the
concern
of
the
statute
is
that
we
be
able
to
inspect
it
in
the
pack
in
order
to
determine
that
the
statutory
standards
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
that
is
correct.
so
the
question
is,
where
does
it
fall?
is
it
the
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
turner
versus
maryland
case,
or
is
it
a
heidell
case?
and
i
would
simply
point
out
that
in
heidell,
this
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
other
possible
reasons
for
the
requirement
that
--
a
packing
within
the
state
other
than
the
sole
requirement
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
packing
business
for
themselves.
were
that
the
case
in
this
statute,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
lettuce,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
asparagus,
it
would
be
made
applicable
to
colliflower
and
the
whole
gamut
products,
it
is
not.
there
is
no
requirement.
the
only
reason
that
they
have
to
pack
in
the
state
is
because
they
--
that
they
have
to
build
a
packing
shed
is
that
they
cannot
pack
except
in
the
packing
shed.
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
if
they
want
to
pack
underneath
the
shade
tree,
that's
fine,
we
can
then
carry
out
the
inspection
responsibilities
with
which
mr.
pike
is
charged
under
the
statute.
now,
with
regard
to
sligh
versus
kirkwood,
i
simply
thoroughly
disagree
that
that
was
a
--
a
health
and
safety
measure.
i
need
not
re-read
the
language
that
the
chief
justice
has
read.
that
language
is
significant
to
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
points
out
that
it
is
a
proper
purpose
to
be
concern
with
the
state's
reputation
in
interstate
commerce,
and
secondly,
it
points
out
that
as
long
as
that
could
have
been
the
legislative
purpose,
then
the
statute
will
be
upheld.
mr.
abramson
as
i
understand
his
comments,
agreed
that
turner
versus
maryland
was
against
him,
but
argues
that
is
too
old
and
therefore,
the
court
ought
not
to
follow
it.
mr.
justice
stewart,
so
that
you
don't
think
that
i'm
totally
incompetent
in
having
missed
it
the
first
time
around,
let
me
point
out
that
the
language
that
i
found
which
thoroughly
resolves
this
comes
at
the
end
of
a
very
long,
long
opinion
in
order
to
save
you
the
same
problem.
might
i
point
out
that
is
at
page
57
of
the
united
states
reports.
finally
and
in
conclusion
and
i
won't
need
to
use
my
seven
minutes,
this
is
an
economic
regulation.
it's
a
regulation
imposed
by
a
state
pursuant
to
its
police
powers,
and
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear,
starting
at
nebbia
versus
new
york
that
there
is
a
heavy
burden
which
rests
upon
those
individuals
who
seek
to
upset
that
police
power
regulation
on
the
ground
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
federal
statute
with
which
this
is
inconsistent,
certainly
under
this
court's
decision
in
paul
and
so
forth.
on
conclusion,
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
never
on
these
grounds
your
honor.
the
–
there
have
been
probably
half
a
dozen
at
the
outside,
pieces
of
litigation
involving
these
statutes
and
most
of
them
have
involved
bonds
that
the
shippers
had
put
up
and
--
nothing
of
this
magnitude.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none
of
the
issues
involved
here
have
ever
been
passed
upon
--
have
even
been
passed
upon
by
a
state
court.
it
is
agreed
on
all
sides
supported
by
the
record,
supported
by
square
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
a
legitimate
interest,
so
long
as
these
fruits
and
vegetables
remain
in
the
language
of
this
court
within
the
bosom
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
requiring
that
they
be
packed
according
to
the
standards
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
prescribed.
once
you
start
from
that
premise,
it
is
simply
inevitable
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
enforce
those
standards
according
to
its
own
inspection
officers.
the
statutory
standards
necessarily
involve
manners
of
judgment.
material
misrepresentation
of
the
entire
quantity,
uniformity
of
quality,
uniformity
of
size,
uniformity
of
color,
these
are
judgment
matters.
we
submit
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
right
to
have
these
judgment
matters
resolved
by
the
judgment
of
its
own
inspection
officers
and
not
inspection
officers
of
someone
else
outside
the
state.
in
conclusion,
when
this
first
came
up,
mr.
pike
came
to
me
and
said
well
now,
what
is
this
law,
this
federal
law
that
our
law
violates?
and
i
said
well
mr.
pike,
it's
the
constitution
and
he
said
well,
it's
written
in
english
isn't
it?
can
i
read
it?
and
i
said
well
mr.
pike,
the
constitutions,
you
have
to
understand,
have
a
wealth
of
decisions
behind
him.
and
then
he
said
nevertheless,
it's
written
in
english,
let
me
see
it.
i
showed
to
him
and
he
said
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
he
said
has
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
we
can't
have
a
standardization
act
in
arizona?
i
of
course,
replied
that
congress
had
not
passed
such
a
law.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
because
i'm
sure
this
court
well
knows,
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation,
the
judicial
function
is
a
narrow
one,
and
we
submit
that
this
case
clearly
falls
within
the
bounds
of
legitimate
exercise
of
state
police
power
and
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
