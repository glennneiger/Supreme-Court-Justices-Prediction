but
mr.
sheerer,
you
have
asked
the
mandamus
that’s
an
action
at
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
is
inequitable
action,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
statute
would
be
inequitable
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
want
us
to
tell
this
brave
court
of
ohio,
to
grant
mandamus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
he
should
have
--
he
should
be
prolonged
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
should
have
been
prolonged
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
case
that
suggests
that?
you
can
do
that
in
a
mandamus
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
made
no
effort
to
change
the
mandamus
action.
you
got
the
same
prayer
now
today
that
you
have
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
could
give
sua
sponte.
we
could
give
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
one
and
a
half?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’ll
presume
somebody
will
have
to
decide
that
maybe
like
a
legislature,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
macklin,
why
the
change
in
one
to
seven?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
difficulty
because
i
would
assume
in
60
years
that
the
1%
would
be
much
more
than
it
was
60
years
ago.
because
i
assume
the
population
of
ohio
has
increased.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that.
so
with
the
population
increase
and
the
man
with
more
signatures
required
why
would
you
raise
the
percent?
that’s
my
problem.
