mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
first
of
all
like
to
point
out
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
suggested
the
element
of
mootness
in
this
case
and
of
course
that
is
now
pending
for
your
decisions.
we
feel
very
strongly
however
that
in
the
event,
in
the
unhappy
event,
that
this
court
might
want
to
rule
upon
the
constitutionality
of
our
election
statute
which
is
under
consideration
here.
we
do
recognize
the
fact
that
when
the
court
rules,
it
affects
whatever
rule
that
--
or
whatever
piece
of
legislation
may
then
be
in
effect
and
consequently
feel
would
have
an
effect
upon
our
4%
statute
which
is
going
to
be
effective
some
eight
days
and
today
on
october
the
30th.
notwithstanding,
we
would
like
to
ask
for
some
silver
reflection
on
the
basic
law
of
this
particular
case.
the
appellant
initially
came
in
to
the
trial
court
seeking
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
writ
of
mandamus
to
commend
the
respondent
board
of
elections
and
certain
state
officials
to
place
his
name
on
the
ballot
as
an
independent
candidate
for
election
to
congress
as
united
states
represented
from
the
21st
district
in
ohio.
mr.
brockington
had
failed
at
that
time
to
comply
with
the
existing
statute
requiring
that
he
file
nominating
petitions
signed
by
not
less
than
7%
of
the
number
of
electors
who
were
voted
for
governor
in
the
next
proceeding
general
election
in
that
district.
he
had
filed
petitions
which
are
slightly
in
excess
of
the
1%
which
would
have
been
the
requirement
under
the
former
statute
which
preceded
the
7%
statute.
in
ohio,
by
statutory
definition,
a
writ
of
mandamus
commenced
the
performance
of
an
act
which
the
law
especially
enjoins
as
a
duty
resulting
from
the
office,
press
or
station.
in
addition,
our
state
law
places
a
burden
on
the
relator
to
establish
a
clear
legal
right
to
have
the
writ
issued.
so
implicit,
that
mr.
brockington
suit
was
a
requirement
that
he
showed
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
7%
statute
such
that
the
court
would
be
correct
in
reinstating
the
1%
statute
and
therefore
granting
the
writ
of
mandamus.
now
the
record
will
show
that
at
the
trial
court
level,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
supporting
our
contention
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
7%
statute.
the
essence
of
the
evidence
was
simple
that
mr.
brockington
had
filed
petitions
with
signatures
consisting
of
about
1%
rather
than
the
records
at
7%
and
that
the
respondent
board
of
elections
had
denied
certification
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
petitions.
nothing
more,
this
was
the
entire
thrust
of
the
evidence
which
was
heard
at
the
trial
court
in
cuyahoga
county
in
ohio.
it
was
at
that
time,
and
for
i
know
it
still
is,
the
rule
in
ohio
that
before,
that
an
act
of
the
general
assembly
is
presumed
to
be
constitutional,
and
before
a
court
made
it
very
clearly
constitutional,
it
must
appear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
legislation
and
the
constitutional
provisions
are
clearly
incompatible.
absent
in
appearance
of
such
incompatibility
in
the
evidence
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
was
not
unreasonable
that
our
state
court
should
find
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
existed.
and
now
it’s
made
that
rather
than
being
an
opaque
determination
in
the
court
--
in
the
trial
court,
it
was
quite
clear
that
really
they
had
not
carried
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
had
a
clear
legal
right
to
the
remedy
which
he
ask
for.
in
ohio,
the
basic
philosophy
underline
the
enactment
of
a
statute
requiring
independent
candidates
to
support
the
candidacy
with
petitions
subscribed
by
a
certain
percentage
of
electors
whether
to
be
1%
or
4%
or
7%
is
that
we
feel
that
for
the
best
exercise
of
the
democratic
process,
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
a
candidate
for
any
office
be
required
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
not
the
frivolous
injection
of
its
personality
and
publicity
of
a
political
campaign
but
rather
in
fact
that
he
is
seeking
election
to
that
office.
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
he
be
asked
or
required
rather
to
show
some
marked
demonstration
of
support
from
at
least
a
fraction
of
the
electorate
within
the
area
from
which
he
seeks
election.
we
believe
that
such
a
requirement
is
necessary
to
establish
a
bona
fide
intent
on
the
part
of
the
candidate.
and
in
this
respect
we
are
supported
in
our
belief
in
the
knowledge
that
some
44
sister
states
have
some
form
of
similar
requirement
and
either
greater
or
lesser
degree.
in
actual
fact
i
believe
there
are
11
other
states
which
now
would
require
a
greater
degree
of
percentage
than
does
ohio
in
view
of
its
4%
statute
coming
out.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
there
are
five
states
which
had
no
requirement
at
all
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
can
tell
you,
yes
sir.
there
are
no
provisions
in
hawaii
or
in
delaware
and
florida,
michigan
or
mississippi.
and
this
is
according
to
our
research.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
provisions
for
a
coming
up
with
a
requirement
of
a
certain
percentage
of
electors
to
sign
the
petitions
or
nominations,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
would
you
please
repeat,
sir?
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i’m
quite
sure
they
do
your
honor
but
we
only
looked
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
percentage
requirement.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
in
the
course
of
our
research.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
it
is
not
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
don’t
really
know
your
honor.
this
was
established
by
the
legislature.
i
do
think
that
the
appellant
indicates
a
long
history
of
a
very
comfortable
arrangement
with
the
1%
requirement.
i
think
it’s
conjectural.
i
think
that
we
might
very
well
ask,
what
might
the
history
have
been
with
1-1/2%
percent,
with
a
4%
with
a
7%
and
moreover,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
i
can
only
suggest
that
this
was
in
the
--
within
the
sole
area
of
the
legislature
of
that
time.
however,
since
they
have
taken
another
look
at
it
and
they
have
reduced
it
to
4%
and
perhaps
they
have
looked
at
other
states
and
seen
what
they
have
but
i
think
it’s
purely
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
and
in
this
case
that’s
what
they
did
exercise.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
your
honor
there
are
not,
we
looked
for
this.
we
looked
newspapers
and
everything
else.
but
as
you
know
that
the
deliberations
are
not
now
set
out
as
they
were
formally
in
1852.
we
believe
the
requirement
of
showing
some
bona
fide
intent
upon
the
candidate
really
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
voter
and
quite
frankly,
we
believe
it
to
be
supportive
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle.
in
that,
the
voters
are
short
that
when
he
cast
his
vote
for
candidate
he
was
qualified
fro
the
ballot,
his
vote
will
be
in
effective
expression
of
a
preference
for
a
candidate
and
the
vote
would
be
undiluted
in
its
relationship
to
all
other
votes
cast.
since
he
will
have
voted
in
behalf
of
a
candidate
of
proof
and
intent,
now
we
freely
admit
that
our
statutes
do
distinguish
between
the
independent
candidate
and
the
candidate
who
is
running
for
a
party
nomination.
and
as
i
pointed
out
previously
i
believe
a
party
candidate
is
required
only
to
have
100
signatures
on
his
ballot.
but
we
consider
that
the
reason
for
this
distinction
lies
in
the
difference,
in
the
path
of
the
party
candidate
must
follow
as
opposed
to
the
independent
candidate.
the
party
candidate
is
put
to
great
time,
expense,
although
he
lays
his
principles
on
the
line,
on
the
issues
which
may
be
before
the
people
of
that
time
and
certainly
in
ohio
party
primary
fights
are
very
difficult
time
for
the
candidates.
we
feel
that
to
proscribe
a
parity
between
an
independent
and
a
party
candidate
would
in
effect
be
discriminatory
as
to
the
party
candidates
and
this
is.
but
this
is
not
really
the
issue
that’s
been
raised
in
this
case
because
the
appellant
certainly
in
his
briefs
openly
subscribes
to
the
1%
requirement
and
this
of
itself
is
a
greater
demand
of
the
independent
then
it
would
be
of
the
party
candidate.
its
only
complaint
why
is
the
degree
of
the
burden
that
may
be
cast
upon
the
independent
candidate
and
he
really
fails
to
tell
us
what
increment
beyond
1%
triggers
off
the
avalanche
of
unconstitutional
invalidity.
he
would
ask
this
court
to
determine
some
magic
figure
of
percentage
and
to
oppose
upon
the
state
of
ohio
and
quite
clear
the
other
states
would
be
affected
by
this,
this
court’s
ideas
of
what
that
policy
might
be.
we
submit
that
the
appellant
has
not
offered
guidelines.
there
are
no
clear
or
valid
criteria
which
been
presented
to
this
court
which
might
establish
a
basis
for
determining
some
magic
percentage.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
the
state
interest
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
state
interest
that
we
feel
is
as
far
as
we
can
say
a
compelling
state
interest
is
simply
that
we
are
requiring
that
an
independent
candidate
show
that
he
has
a
valid
intent
to
actually
run
and
that
he
may
--
that
he
does
have
the
support
of
at
least
a
fraction
of
the
electorate
in
furthering
his
candidacy.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well
this
would
be
a
part
of
it
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
we
didn’t
particularly
feel
that
williams
versus
rhodes
was
applicable
to
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
different
case,
a
difference
proposition.
and
actually
there
was
no
consideration
of
this
particular
statute
in
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
and
we
didn’t
feel
that
you
completely
knocked
out
the
electoral
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
--
machinery
in
ohio
when
this
took
place.
have
i
answered
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
to
go
on,
we
submit
that
the
determination
of
requirements
to
qualify
an
independent
candidate
for
certification
of
a
ballot
ought
properly
to
believe
--
to
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
where
the
knowledge
of
local
conditions
and
special
considerations
of
assessing
the
validity
of
candidate
intent
are
really
within
the
sphere
of
a
political
question
belonging
to
the
state.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
first

that

mr.

at

there

ask

in

the
basic
philosophy
underline
the
enactment
of
a
statute
requiring
independent
candidates
to
support
the
candidacy
with
petitions
subscribed
by
a

of

which
now
would

does
ohio
in
view
of
its
4%
statute
coming
out.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
there
are
five
states
which
had
no
requirement
at
all
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
can
tell
you,
yes
sir.
there
are
no
provisions
in
hawaii
or
in
delaware
and
florida,
michigan
or
mississippi.
and
this
is
according
to
our
research.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
provisions
for
a
coming
up
with
a
requirement
of
a
certain
percentage
of
electors
to
sign
the
petitions
or
nominations,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
would
you
please
repeat,
sir?
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i’m
quite
sure
they
do
your
honor
but
we
only
looked
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
percentage
requirement.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
in
the
course
of
our
research.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no,
it
is
not
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
i
don’t
really
know
your
honor.
this
was
established
by
the
legislature.
i
do
think
that
the
appellant
indicates
a
long
history
of
a
very
comfortable
arrangement
with
the
1%
requirement.
i
think
it’s
conjectural.
i
think
that
we
might
very
well
ask,
what
might
the
history
have
been
with
1-1/2%
percent,
with
a
4%
with
a
7%
and
moreover,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
i
can
only
suggest
that
this
was
in
the
--
within
the
sole
area
of
the
legislature
of
that
time.
however,
since
they
have
taken
another
look
at
it
and
they
have
reduced
it
to
4%
and
perhaps
they
have
looked
at
other
states
and
seen
what
they
have
but
i
think
it’s
purely
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
and
in
this
case
that’s
what
they
did
exercise.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
no
your
honor
there
are
not,
we
looked
for
this.
we
looked
newspapers
and
everything
else.
but
as
you
know
that
the
deliberations
are
not
now
set
out
as
they
were
formally
in
1852.
we
believe
the
requirement
of
showing
some
bona
fide
intent
upon
the
candidate
really
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
voter
and
quite
frankly,
we
believe
it
to
be
supportive
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle.
in
that,
the
voters
are
short
that
when
he
cast
his
vote
for
candidate
he
was
qualified
fro
the
ballot,
his
vote
will
be
in
effective
expression
of
a
preference
for
a
candidate
and
the
vote
would
be
undiluted
in
its
relationship
to
all
other
votes
cast.
since
he
will
have
voted
in
behalf
of
a
candidate
of
proof
and
intent,
now
we
freely
admit
that
our
statutes
do
distinguish
between
the
independent
candidate
and
the
candidate
who
is
running
for
a
party
nomination.
and
as
i
pointed
out
previously
i
believe
a
party
candidate
is
required
only
to
have
100
signatures
on
his
ballot.
but
we
consider
that
the
reason
for
this
distinction
lies
in
the
difference,
in
the
path
of
the
party
candidate
must
follow
as
opposed
to
the
independent
candidate.
the
party
candidate
is
put
to
great
time,
expense,
although
he
lays
his
principles
on
the
line,
on
the
issues
which
may
be
before
the
people
of
that
time
and
certainly
in
ohio
party
primary
fights
are
very
difficult
time
for
the
candidates.
we
feel
that
to
proscribe
a
parity
between
an
independent
and
a
party
candidate
would
in
effect
be
discriminatory
as
to
the
party
candidates
and
this
is.
but
this
is
not
really
the
issue
that’s
been
raised
in
this
case
because
the
appellant
certainly
in
his
briefs
openly
subscribes
to
the
1%
requirement
and
this
of
itself
is
a
greater
demand
of
the
independent
then
it
would
be
of
the
party
candidate.
its
only
complaint
why
is
the
degree
of
the
burden
that
may
be
cast
upon
the
independent
candidate
and
he
really
fails
to
tell
us
what
increment
beyond
1%
triggers
off
the
avalanche
of
unconstitutional
invalidity.
he
would
ask
this
court
to
determine
some
magic
figure
of
percentage
and
to
oppose
upon
the
state
of
ohio
and
quite
clear
the
other
states
would
be
affected
by
this,
this
court’s
ideas
of
what
that
policy
might
be.
we
submit
that
the
appellant
has
not
offered
guidelines.
there
are
no
clear
or
valid
criteria
which
been
presented
to
this
court
which
might
establish
a
basis
for
determining
some
magic
percentage.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
the
state
interest
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
state
interest
that
we
feel
is
as
far
as
we
can
say
a
compelling
state
interest
is
simply
that
we
are
requiring
that
an
independent
candidate
show
that
he
has
a
valid
intent
to
actually
run
and
that
he
may
--
that
he
does
have
the
support
of
at
least
a
fraction
of
the
electorate
in
furthering
his
candidacy.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well
this
would
be
a
part
of
it
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
well,
we
didn’t
particularly
feel
that
williams
versus
rhodes
was
applicable
to
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
different
case,
a
difference
proposition.
and
actually
there
was
no
consideration
of
this
particular
statute
in
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
and
we
didn’t
feel
that
you
completely
knocked
out
the
electoral
--
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
--
machinery
in
ohio
when
this
took
place.
have
i
answered
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
robert
d.
macklin
to
go
on,
we
submit
that
the
determination
of
requirements
to
qualify
an
independent
candidate
for
certification
of
a
ballot
ought
properly
to
believe
--
to
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
where
the
knowledge
of
local
conditions
and
special
considerations
of
assessing
the
validity
of
candidate
intent
are
really
within
the
sphere
of
a
political
question
belonging
to
the
state.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
thank
you
very
much.
