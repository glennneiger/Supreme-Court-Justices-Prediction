justice

stewart
was
that
1%
rule
applicable
across
the
board
all
independent
candidates
for
any
elective
office
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
likewise.
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
is
a
--
wanted
to
be
an
independent
candidate
for
election
to
the
house
of
representatives.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
then,
in
order
to
appear
on
the
ballot
in
november,
he
has
to
win
a
primary
election
and
get
a
majority
of
the
people
voting
on
the
primary.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
many,
many
thousands.
justice
potter
stewart
this
7%
requirement
that
you
attack
here.
justice
potter
stewart
which
we
now
know
has
been
reduced
to
4
but
in
any
event
attacked.
justice
potter
stewart
those
can
be
signatures
of
member
of
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
or
no
party.
justice
potter
stewart
or
some
other
third
parties,
isn’t
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
not
limited
to
people
who
have
not
voted
in
party
primaries
for
example,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
field
is
open
to
registered
voters.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
to
the
merits.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
mention
the
question
of
mootness,
i
missed
it,
i
trust
you
well
before
you
conclude.
justice
potter
stewart
the
relief
you
asked
and
i’m
looking
at
page
8
of
the
appendix,
was
not
for
a
declaratory
judgment
but
this
was
an
action
in
mandamus
in
which
you
directed
yourself
to
getting
your
client
on
the
ballot
for
a
specific
election,
i.e.
the
election
of
november
5,
1968
and
no
other.
and
there
is
no
request
for
general
declaratory
relief.
i
was
wondering
if
that
quite
a
part
from
the
fact
of
the
statutes
now
have
been
amended
to
reduce
the
requirement
from
7%
to
4%
quite
apart
from
that.
i
was
wondering
if
this
isn’t
moot
just
by
reason
to
the
fact
that
the
relief
you
ask
is
now
impossible
to
be
accorded
to.
you
didn’t
ask
that
the
election
be
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understood
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
please
correct
me
if
i’m
mistaken,
decided
this
before
the
election
for
which
you
asked
to
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
so
obviously
it
wasn’t
moot
then.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
this
requirement
compare
to
the
requirements
of
other
states
with
respect
to
independent
candidate
is
contrasted
with
no
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
i
know
but
that’s
a
different
situation,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
material
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
way
to
get
out
the
--
what
we
call
a
legislative
history
of
that
change
in
1952
from
1%
to
7%
in
the
ohio
as
there
are
no
committee
reports.
justice
potter
stewart
this
could
be
argued
that
this
is
not
necessarily
legislation
against
or
hostile
to
bona
fide
independent
candidate.
in
my
own
experience
and
observation
in
this
very
state
that’s
where
i
grew
up
there.
there
are
such
things
as
people
who
pretend
to
be
independent
candidates
when
what
they’re
really
looking
at
for
is
personal
advertising
or
aggrandizement
and
they
are
not
bona
fide
candidates
and
as
the
ballot
has
filled
up
with
people
like
that
with
so-called
bed
sheet
ballot
of
the
candidate,
of
the
kind
that
used
to
have
in
detroit,
michigan.
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
a
bona
fide
or
true
independent
candidate
for
public
office
to
command
the
attention
of
conscientious
and
responsible
voters,
isn’t
that
true?
