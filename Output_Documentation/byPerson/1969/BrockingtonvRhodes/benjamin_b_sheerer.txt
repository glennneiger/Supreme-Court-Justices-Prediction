mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
case
number
31
brockington
versus
rhodes
today
is
an
election
case
on
appeal
from
the
ohio
supreme
court.
it’s
a
case
that
we
feel
as
this
court
has
said
deals
with
matters
closed
to
the
core
of
our
constitutional
system.
it
follows
a
case
previously
decided
by
this
court
under
the
title
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
dealt
with
the
right
of
third
parties
to
attain
ballot
status
in
ohio.
this
case
deals
with
the
right
of
independent
candidates
to
obtain
ballot
status
in
the
state
of
ohio.
we
think
the
case
itself
raises
two
main
issues.
the
first
issue
arises
in
this
manner.
ohio
allows
independent
candidates
to
secure
ballot
status
through
the
filing
of
nominating
petitions
signed
a
certain
number
of
qualified
voters.
now
up
to
1952,
that
number
was
1%,
that
number
was
1%
for
60
something
years.
in
1952,
the
amount
was
increased
to
7%.
now,
under
the
1%
rule
which
had
existed
for
60
something
years,
there
was
no
substantial,
no
disruptive
interference
with
the
election
procedure
by
independents.
in
fact,
participation
by
independents
was
slight
perhaps
even
minimal
in
the
ohio
election
process.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
that
is
my
understanding.
and
in
fact
sir
the
7%
is
likewise
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
--
applicable
across
the
board.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir
that’s
correct,
for
21
first
congressional
district
state
of
ohio
and
in
november
1968
general
election.
now
we
say
that
given
that
history
of
no
disruption,
no
substantial
interference,
no
overburdening
of
election
process,
the
increase,
the
sevenfold
increase
in
the
requirement
constitutes
a
burden
on
first
amendment,
freedoms,
a
limitation
of
first
amendment
freedoms
of
association
and
speech
and
a
burden
on
the
right
to
cast
an
effective
ballot,
a
right
to
participate
equally
in
the
election
process.
now,
the
second
main
issue
we
see
arising
is
the
barrier
itself.
in
our
case,
for
example,
my
man,
mr.
brockington,
the
appellant
here
would
have
had
to
secure
5,974
valid
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
now
as
a
rule
of
thumb,
any
politician
will
tell
you
this
means
get
50%
more.
in
other
words,
he
would
have
had
to
obtain
9,000
signatures
most
likely
of
which
perhaps
6,000
would
be
valid
in
order
to
qualify.
now
a
party
candidate
qualifies
for
the
primary
for
being
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
by
simply
securing
100
signatures
if
it’s
an
office
less
than
statewide,
or
1,000
signatures
if
it’s
a
statewide
office.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that’s
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
may
be
the
case.
we
say
however
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
to
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
there
is
either
through
to
the
party
primary
or
as
an
independent.
those
are
the
two
methods
that
ohio
allows.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
my
main
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
my
main
response
was
that,
it
might
be
thousands
of
votes
depending
on
the
size.
that
is
the
only
--
that
is
true,
he
would
have
to
prevail
on
the
party
primary.
i
was
responding
mainly
to
the
size.
it
might
be
the
required
because
it
might
be
a
small
election
district,
that’s
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
would
assume
that
his
name
would
be
on
the
ballot,
that
persons
could
cast
right
in
votes
for
other
people
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
their
primary
ballot
is
secured
one
or
two
ways,
your
honor.
if
it’s
a
less
than
statewide
office,
in
other
words
from
a
congressional
district
or
something
like
that.
you
have
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
100
party
or
100
qualified
voters.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
of
that
party.
if
it’s
for
senator
for
instance
which
would
be
a
statewide
office
or
attorney
general,
you
would
have
to
obtain
1,000
signatures
of
qualified
voters
in
that
party,
the
difference
for
the
independent
courses
that
he
must
obtain
a
number
equally
to
7%
of
those
people
who
voted
for
governor
in
the
applicable
district
in
the
last
previous
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
my
feeling
is
not
often
sir.
probably
so
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
so.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
not
only
through
comparison
or
disproportion
of
a
100
signatures
for
instance
approximately
6,000
here
but
also
of
the
election
of
the
barrier
itself.
the
election
of
the
7%
or
now
the
4%
being
offense
to
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violative
of
it.
the
equal
protection
clause
as
in
the
election
area
deals
with
fundamental
rights
and
the
classifications
that
might
limit
or
restrict
these
rights
are
carefully
scrutinized
and
closely
confined
to
whatever
might
be
determined
to
be
a
necessity
of
the
case.
now,
the
particular
facts
in
which
these
case
arise
are
these.
as
has
been
noted,
my
--
the
appellant
was
an
independent
candidate
for
the
twenty-first
congressional
district
in
november
of
1968.
his
petitions
were
good
and
sufficient
except
for
the
signature
requirement.
the
number
of
signatures
required.
when
he
was
turned
down
for
a
ballot
position,
this
suit
was
filed
for
mandamus
against
various
officials
of
the
state
of
ohio
having
to
do
with
the
election
process.
the
theory
of
the
suit
was
this,
from
the
beginning.
we
have
urged
in
this
case
that
the
7%
requirement
was
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
this
being
so
we
said,
he
does
say
as
prior
to
1%
requirement.
the
7%
requirement
being
unconstitutional,
the
thing
to
do
is
to
certify
him
for
the
ballot.
he
met
the
1%
requirement.
the
amendment
to
7%
being
held
unconstitutional
is
void
and
have
no
effect,
the
1%
requirement
is
in
effect
and
he
should
have
been
given
ballot
status.
now,
at
trial,
the
trial
court
agreed
that
he
met
the
constitutional
requirements
for
the
office.
essential
facts
of
the
case
are
admitted
on
the
record
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
seemed
to
indicate
and
it
believed
that
only
the
legal
issue
remained
the
constitutionality
of
the
increase.
nevertheless,
in
its
opinion
it
ruled
against
us.
its
opinion
to
me
can
best
be
described
as
opaque.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
basis
of
the
rule.
appeal
was
promptly
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
state.
we
made
several
attempts
to
get
on
the
ballot
at
that
point.
we
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
was
denied.
by
this
time,
this
court
had
acted
in
the
williams
case
and
it
had
placed
governor
wallace
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
depending
upon
the
determination
this
court
made.
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
it
do
likewise.
that
is
if
mr.
brockington
want
a
suit
there,
he
would
be
on
the
ballot,
if
not,
he
is
to
be
blocked
out.
that
was
denied
us.
we
brought
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
a
socialist
labor
party
case,
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
to
the
attention
of
court
of
appeals.
nevertheless,
they
ruled
against
us
without
opinion.
we
then
went
to
the
ohio
supreme
court.
we
obtained
the
prompt
hearing
there.
i
think
it
was
october
16.
this
court
had
just
decided
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case.
i
brought
that
case
to
the
court’s
attention.
nevertheless,
that
court
and
before
the
election
dismissed
on
our
appeal
sua
sponte
as
involving
no
substantial
constitutional
question.
we
took
appeal
to
this
court,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted.
now
since
that
time,
the
ohio
legislature
has
reduced
the
percentage
to
4%.
i’m
here
to
urge
today
that
the
4%
requirement
is
unconstitutional
that
this
court
should
still
act
in
this
case.
that
the
case
requires
decision
and
that
the
appellant
deserves
a
decision
from
the
court
on
these
important
issues.
now
throughout
this
case,
to
my
mind
the
appellees
have
refused
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
issues.
we
challenge
them
in
the
courts
below
to
do
that.
i
don’t
think
they
have
done
it
at
any
point.
now,
my
conclusion
is
they
have
not
and
for
this
reason
that
the
7%
increase
was
patently
unconstitutional
and
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
4%
requirement
is
also
unconstitutional.
i
say
this
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
60-year
history
--
the
60-year
history
of
an
election
system
is
running
without
problems
under
a
1%
requirement.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
would
be
happy
to
respond
to
that
at
this
time
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
the
election
just
passed.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
i
would
hope
not
your
honor
and
i
believe
it
should
not
be
regarded
this
moot.
first
of
all,
although
i’m
not
sure,
i
know
in
ogilvie
versus
moore
recently
decided
by
this
court
election
had
passed.
whether
prayer
was
for
declaratory
relief,
i
don’t
recall
at
this
point.
if
it
was
not,
i
would
certainly
say
as
authority
at
this
time.
your
honor,
i
believe
the
mootness
rule
is
a
rule,
a
judicial
rule
not
mandated
necessarily
by
the
constitution
although
perhaps
by
the
case
in
controversy
rule
the
constitution.
but
in
any
event,
we
have
had
in
this
case,
a
case
that
was
tested
to
three
lower
courts
as
a
completely
adversarial
proceeding.
the
appellees
here
were
--
at
every
proceeding
filed
briefs,
i
argued
the
case,
i
can
assure
you
it
was
haughtily
contested.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
they
decided
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor.
the
appellees,
one
of
the
appellees
makes
the
suggestion
that
the
dismissal
there
was
because
they
couldn’t
grant
relief
but
if
that
was
so,
i
think
they
would
have
said
so.
they
said
that
they
found
no
substantial
constitutional
issue
involved.
i
think
it
has
been
litigated
and
litigated
solely
on
the
merits
through
three
courts
below.
secondly,
i
like
to
point
out
that
election
cases
are
treated
differently,
i
believe,
than
other
cases.
election
cases
are
peculiarly
difficult
to
get
complete
and
adequate
review
on.
they
just
are
as
effective
length.
it’s
the
--
naturally
the
opponent
in
election
case
wants
to
delay,
he
wants
to
get
the
election
over
and
so
it’s
just
almost
impossible
to
get
adequate
complete
review
on
these
cases
and
yet
the
question
comes
up
again.
this
is
not
a
question
that
will
be
finally
determined.
now,
if
this
court
does
not
resolve
it,
people
arise
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
if
that
is
possible
i’m
going
to
request
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
sir
i
don’t
have
specific
authority
as
to
the
capability
of
the
court
to
do
that.
i
do
say
this
that
this
is
not
an
unnecessary
question.
that
is
a
question
that
will
come
up
again
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
we
did
not
include
an
allegation
in
the
court
below
when
this
case
was
submitted
should
not
be
determined
of
this
issue.
the
--
this
is
not
an
academic
question
as
i
say.
it
will
come
up
again.
election
matters
tend
to
recur
and
many
times
the
courts
have
said
that
where
it’s
a
matter
of
great
and
public
importance,
where
it
transcends
the
individual
case,
we
will
go
ahead
and
decide
this
point
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
to
preserve
the
electoral
process
to
enhance
it
and
the
cases
to
that
effect
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
didn’t
here
the
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
sir
we
--
what
we
said
and
what
we
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
we
want
this
court
to
say,
your
honor
that
the
courts
below
were
in
error
that
they
should
have
held
that
the
7%
requirement
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
1%
requirement
was
in
effect.
now,
what
we
are
asking
is
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
that
was
what
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir.
that
he
should
have
been
granted
valid
status.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
we
do
cite
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
that
is
true.
however,
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit
is
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit
has
always
been
that
the
1%
requirement
was
appropriate
and
the
7%
was
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
the
--
we
say
this.
that
the
60-year
history
shows
that
it
had
been
an
existence
for
60
years
that
there
was
no
need
for
an
increase.
now,
i’m
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
it
sanctify
or
hold
that
the
1%
requirements
constitutional
because
i
don’t
think
that
its
quite
the
issue
here
because
--
and
i’m
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
whether
1%
could
be
said
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
asking
the
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
legislature
here.
what
i
we’re
saying
is
this
that
where
there
has
been
this
type
of
history
and
no
interference
or
disruption,
the
legislature
cannot
just
increase
--
make
increase
at
sevenfold
driving
independents
and
minorities
parties
off
the
ballot.
they
cannot
show
a
justification
for
this
increase.
now
as
to
the
validity
of
the
1%
requirement
itself,
i
take
it
that
could
be
the
subject
of
litigation
sometime,
if
so
i
wanted
to
litigate
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
entirely
clear
on
that
mr.
justice,
i
can
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
again
i
have
to
respond
to
my
historical
argument
that
this
was
not
great
participation
that
it
was
hardly
any
independent
activity
and
the
raise
at
sevenfold
just
about
ended
independent
activity
and
also
as
a
historical
fact
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir
and
of
course
if
we
cannot
prevail
here,
i’m
sure
that
4%
statute
is
going
to
be
subject
of
litigation.
we’d
like
to
avoid
that
if
we
could.
we’d
like
to
avoid
another
long
process
litigation
when
we
think
the
issues
could
not
be
presented
any
differently
to
this
court
if
it
came
back
again.
i
cannot
conceive
of
the
question
being
different
at
all
before
this
court
if
it
were
brought
back
again.
i
think
the
exactly
the
same
contending
issues
would
be
before
the
court
if
it
came
back.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
clear,
your
honor
whether
he
will
or
not.
certainly,
in
the
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
i
think
it’s
possible.
he
might,
he’s
had
a
taste
of
it
and
he
–
it
wasn’t
very
successful.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
he
was
able
to
run
as
a
write-in
candidate
of
course.
thanks
to
the
relief
we
got
from
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
socialist
labor
party
case.
i’m
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
case
carroll
versus
princess
anne
recalling
that.
but
i
recall
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
relief
could
not
be
granted.
i
believe
it
was
an
injunction
case
and
as
to
whether
or
not,
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment.
prayer
in
that,
i’m
not
sure
but
i
do
remember
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
was
the
question
as
considered
of
such
public
importance
that
this
court
decided
it.
now,
in
addition
to
the
history
which
we
believe
is
a
vital
importance
here.
this
court
has
held
in
this
area,
in
the
area
of
the
election
cases
three
principles
i
believe.
number
one,
is
that
there
is
sanctity
in
the
individual
ballot
that
every
man’s
vote
is
equal
the
others
and
that
our
guarantee
is
the
right
to
cast
an
effective
ballot.
secondly,
that
constitution
guarantees
free
and
equal
competition
in
areas,
ideas,
and
governmental
policy
in
the
electoral
process.
the
first
amendment
in
the
election
process
are
inextricably
intertwined.
and
finally,
that
minority
and
independent
candidates
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
needless
disadvantage.
now
in
determining
whether
a
statute
can
pass
constitutional
master
in
this
area,
the
court
has
said
it
will
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
law.
look
at
what
the
state
claims
to
be
protecting
and
look
at
the
interests
that
are
disadvantaged
by
the
law.
and
to
allow
verdicts,
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
suggest
no
state
interest
can
be
advanced,
has
not
been
advanced
or
could
be
advanced
for
the
sevenfold
or
the
fourfold
increase.
we
hope
the
court
will
act,
will
indicate
that
the
1%
was
a
sealing
but
beyond
which
the
legislature
could
not
go.
help
us
restore
some
health
to
the
ohio
election
process.
free
as
--
so
that
in
the
oncoming
months,
the
legislature
can
take
further
action
if
they
want
to
or
so
that
independents
can
participate,
minority
parties
can
participate
in
the
election
process.
otherwise,
the
result
is
going
to
be
--
people
will
be
frozen
off
the
ballot
and
that
there
will
be
a
necessity
of
further
litigation
on
a
question
that
is
squarely
before
the
court
on
this
record.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
not
your
honor.
i
believe
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
no,
i
believe
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
that.
the
constitution
is
neutral
on
parties.
it
does
not
enshrine
them
to
give
them
any
special
sanctity.
now,
i
do
not
maintain
today
that
some
regulation
cannot
be
placed
as
to
obtaining
ballot
status,
but
i
say
it
must
be
minimal.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
i
say
this
that
--
and
i
want
to
be
perfectly
clear
on
this,
i’m
not
saying
that
this
court
--
this
case
requires
this
court
to
say
1%
is
constitutional.
it
asks
only
that
this
court
to
say
an
increase
beyond
1%
in
view
of
a
history
was
unconstitutional.
now
someday,
someone
may
be
able
to
present
a
case,
litigated
case,
present
a
record
to
a
court
which
would
hold,
which
will
lead
it
to
hold
that
the
1%
is
unconstitutional.
i’m
not
asking
today
for
endorsement
of
that
1%.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
very,
very
high.
you’ll
remember
that
in
footnote
9,
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
the
court
noted
that
42
other
states
require
1%
for
third
parties.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
but
if
there
--
only
require
parties
to
require
1%,
the
party
is
a
structure
as
to
an
organization
is
the
one
to
obtain
ballot
status.
how
much
harder
is
it
to
require
7%
from
an
independent
candidate?
the
other
states
in
our
research
are
much
lower.
much
lower
and
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no
sir
it
is
not.
i
believe
that
we
got
in
to
that
question
in
the
socialist
labor
party
brief
and
i
am
not
--
i
am
going
by
memory
on
that.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
might
make
some
comments,
first
of
all
on
the
statements
from
appellees’
counsel.
i
do
not
believe
that
a
candidate
for
office
has
to
be
able
to
show
that
he
can
win.
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
socialist
labor
party
case
pointed
out
that
the
right
of
free
speech
is
the
right
also
to
be
wrong.
and
we
said
that
anybody
that
manifests
a
degree
of
sincerity
about
this
candidacy
is
entitled
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
other
people
might
consider
that
candidacy
frivolous
or
pointless
whatever.
it’s
part
of
our
basic
framework
of
our
society
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
suffrage
and
to
offer
themselves
as
a
candidate.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
was
achieved
by
the
williams-rhodes
case
in
the
three-judge
district
court.
that
is
right.
i
would
point
out
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
with
the
exception
of
--
if
you
are
running
for
president,
he
would
have
to
--
well
now,
ohio
requires
filing
of
declaration
intent
to
serve
shortly
before.
let
me
point
out
that
williams
and
rhodes
notes
that
write-in
is
not
a
comparable
to
ballot
status
that
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
points
out
it’s
a
disability,
the
majority
opinion
points
out
that
it
cannot
be
compared
and
that
is
a
definite
disadvantage
to
a
candidacy.
the
reduction
of
4%
in
the
ohio
legislature
came
after
this
court
and
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
guideline
--
the
only
guideline
we
are
advancing
here
is
when
that
history
is
offered.
history
has
pointed
out
the
guideline
in
this
case.
let
me
point
out
also
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
legislature
is
failed
to
act
as
was
the
case
in
the
reapportionment
cases
where
the
legislature
failed
to
reapportion.
this
is
a
case
where
the
legislature
is
acted
twice
in
ohio
and
against
the
interest
of
independent
candidates
and
minority
party
candidates.
this
is
a
case
that
particularly
requires
to
relief
that
this
court
can
require,
can
give.
there
are
no
independents
in
ohio
legislature.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
could
be
so
your
honor.
in
williams
and
rhodes,
the
court
spoke
of
it
as
a
remote
danger.
nothing
in
the
case
that
it
does
exists
and
cited
on
mine
workers
case
from
illinois.
he
is
saying
that
these
rights
cannot
be
infringed
on
a
speculative
danger.
i
think
that
the
intelligence
of
the
legislature
is
equal
to
that
sort
of
problem,
if
it
became
a
problem.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
it
was
or
will
become
a
problem,
and
i
would
hate
to
defy
bona
fide
candidate
for
the
court.
i
think
that
probably
an
attack
the
court
should
take
this
one
noted
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
the
parties
have
to
begin,
people
have
to
begin
somewhere.
there
should
be
allowed
a
free
and
equal
chance
to
engage
in
a
competition
of
our
electoral
process.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
don’t
know,
not
about
him
in
nature
your
honor
but
i
suppose
that
it
might
discourage
some
people.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
certainly
if
there
where
a
showing
your
honor
that
this
was
happening.
that
people
were
being
discouraged
from
voting
or
confused
to
something
like
that,
this
case
--
the
situation
will
be
entirely
different.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that’s
right
your
honor.
because
the
holding
of
this
court
is
that
where
fundamental
liberties
are
involved,
the
inquiry
will
be
made
as
to
what
interest
the
state
is
protecting.
this
court
is
the
defender
of
individuals,
minority
rights
and
it
looks
when
these
people’s
rights
are
burdened
or
restricted;
it
looks
to
the
interests
that
the
state
is
against
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
case
number
31
brockington
versus
rhodes
today
is
an
election
case
on
appeal
from
the
ohio
supreme
court.
it’s
a
case
that
we
feel
as
this
court
has
said
deals
with
matters
closed
to
the
core
of
our
constitutional
system.
it
follows
a
case
previously
decided
by
this
court
under
the
title
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
dealt
with
the
right
of
third
parties
to
attain
ballot
status
in
ohio.
this
case
deals
with
the
right
of
independent
candidates
to
obtain
ballot
status
in
the
state
of
ohio.
we
think
the
case
itself
raises
two
main
issues.
the
first
issue
arises
in
this
manner.
ohio
allows
independent
candidates
to
secure
ballot
status
through
the
filing
of
nominating
petitions
signed
a
certain
number
of
qualified
voters.
now
up
to
1952,
that
number
was
1%,
that
number
was
1%
for
60
something
years.
in
1952,
the
amount
was
increased
to
7%.
now,
under
the
1%
rule
which
had
existed
for
60
something
years,
there
was
no
substantial,
no
disruptive
interference
with
the
election
procedure
by
independents.
in
fact,
participation
by
independents
was
slight
perhaps
even
minimal
in
the
ohio
election
process.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
that
is
my
understanding.
and
in
fact
sir
the
7%
is
likewise
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
--
applicable
across
the
board.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir
that’s
correct,
for
21
first
congressional
district
state
of
ohio
and
in
november
1968
general
election.
now
we
say
that
given
that
history
of
no
disruption,
no
substantial
interference,
no
overburdening
of
election
process,
the
increase,
the
sevenfold
increase
in
the
requirement
constitutes
a
burden
on
first
amendment,
freedoms,
a
limitation
of
first
amendment
freedoms
of
association
and
speech
and
a
burden
on
the
right
to
cast
an
effective
ballot,
a
right
to
participate
equally
in
the
election
process.
now,
the
second
main
issue
we
see
arising
is
the
barrier
itself.
in
our
case,
for
example,
my
man,
mr.
brockington,
the
appellant
here
would
have
had
to
secure
5,974
valid
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
now
as
a
rule
of
thumb,
any
politician
will
tell
you
this
means
get
50%
more.
in
other
words,
he
would
have
had
to
obtain
9,000
signatures
most
likely
of
which
perhaps
6,000
would
be
valid
in
order
to
qualify.
now
a
party
candidate
qualifies
for
the
primary
for
being
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
by
simply
securing
100
signatures
if
it’s
an
office
less
than
statewide,
or
1,000
signatures
if
it’s
a
statewide
office.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that’s
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
may
be
the
case.
we
say
however
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
to
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
there
is
either
through
to
the
party
primary
or
as
an
independent.
those
are
the
two
methods
that
ohio
allows.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
my
main
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
my
main
response
was
that,
it
might
be
thousands
of
votes
depending
on
the
size.
that
is
the
only
--
that
is
true,
he
would
have
to
prevail
on
the
party
primary.
i
was
responding
mainly
to
the
size.
it
might
be
the
required
because
it
might
be
a
small
election
district,
that’s
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
would
assume
that
his
name
would
be
on
the
ballot,
that
persons
could
cast
right
in
votes
for
other
people
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
their
primary
ballot
is
secured
one
or
two
ways,
your
honor.
if
it’s
a
less
than
statewide
office,
in
other
words
from
a
congressional
district
or
something
like
that.
you
have
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
100
party
or
100
qualified
voters.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
of
that
party.
if
it’s
for
senator
for
instance
which
would
be
a
statewide
office
or
attorney
general,
you
would
have
to
obtain
1,000
signatures
of
qualified
voters
in
that
party,
the
difference
for
the
independent
courses
that
he
must
obtain
a
number
equally
to
7%
of
those
people
who
voted
for
governor
in
the
applicable
district
in
the
last
previous
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
my
feeling
is
not
often
sir.
probably
so
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
so.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
not
only
through
comparison
or
disproportion
of
a
100
signatures
for
instance
approximately
6,000
here
but
also
of
the
election
of
the
barrier
itself.
the
election
of
the
7%
or
now
the
4%
being
offense
to
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violative
of
it.
the
equal
protection
clause
as
in
the
election
area
deals
with
fundamental
rights
and
the
classifications
that
might
limit
or
restrict
these
rights
are
carefully
scrutinized
and
closely
confined
to
whatever
might
be
determined
to
be
a
necessity
of
the
case.
now,
the
particular
facts
in
which
these
case
arise
are
these.
as
has
been
noted,
my
--
the
appellant
was
an
independent
candidate
for
the
twenty-first
congressional
district
in
november
of
1968.
his
petitions
were
good
and
sufficient
except
for
the
signature
requirement.
the
number
of
signatures
required.
when
he
was
turned
down
for
a
ballot
position,
this
suit
was
filed
for
mandamus
against
various
officials
of
the
state
of
ohio
having
to
do
with
the
election
process.
the
theory
of
the
suit
was
this,
from
the
beginning.
we
have
urged
in
this
case
that
the
7%
requirement
was
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
this
being
so
we
said,
he
does
say
as
prior
to
1%
requirement.
the
7%
requirement
being
unconstitutional,
the
thing
to
do
is
to
certify
him
for
the
ballot.
he
met
the
1%
requirement.
the
amendment
to
7%
being
held
unconstitutional
is
void
and
have
no
effect,
the
1%
requirement
is
in
effect
and
he
should
have
been
given
ballot
status.
now,
at
trial,
the
trial
court
agreed
that
he
met
the
constitutional
requirements
for
the
office.
essential
facts
of
the
case
are
admitted
on
the
record
in
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
seemed
to
indicate
and
it
believed
that
only
the
legal
issue
remained
the
constitutionality
of
the
increase.
nevertheless,
in
its
opinion
it
ruled
against
us.
its
opinion
to
me
can
best
be
described
as
opaque.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
basis
of
the
rule.
appeal
was
promptly
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
state.
we
made
several
attempts
to
get
on
the
ballot
at
that
point.
we
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
that
was
denied.
by
this
time,
this
court
had
acted
in
the
williams
case
and
it
had
placed
governor
wallace
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
depending
upon
the
determination
this
court
made.
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
it
do
likewise.
that
is
if
mr.
brockington
want
a
suit
there,
he
would
be
on
the
ballot,
if
not,
he
is
to
be
blocked
out.
that
was
denied
us.
we
brought
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
a
socialist
labor
party
case,
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case
to
the
attention
of
court
of
appeals.
nevertheless,
they
ruled
against
us
without
opinion.
we
then
went
to
the
ohio
supreme
court.
we
obtained
the
prompt
hearing
there.
i
think
it
was
october
16.
this
court
had
just
decided
the
williams
versus
rhodes
case.
i
brought
that
case
to
the
court’s
attention.
nevertheless,
that
court
and
before
the
election
dismissed
on
our
appeal
sua
sponte
as
involving
no
substantial
constitutional
question.
we
took
appeal
to
this
court,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted.
now
since
that
time,
the
ohio
legislature
has
reduced
the
percentage
to
4%.
i’m
here
to
urge
today
that
the
4%
requirement
is
unconstitutional
that
this
court
should
still
act
in
this
case.
that
the
case
requires
decision
and
that
the
appellant
deserves
a
decision
from
the
court
on
these
important
issues.
now
throughout
this
case,
to
my
mind
the
appellees
have
refused
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
issues.
we
challenge
them
in
the
courts
below
to
do
that.
i
don’t
think
they
have
done
it
at
any
point.
now,
my
conclusion
is
they
have
not
and
for
this
reason
that
the
7%
increase
was
patently
unconstitutional
and
is
unconstitutional
and
that
the
4%
requirement
is
also
unconstitutional.
i
say
this
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
60-year
history
--
the
60-year
history
of
an
election
system
is
running
without
problems
under
a
1%
requirement.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
would
be
happy
to
respond
to
that
at
this
time
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
the
election
just
passed.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no,
sir.
i
would
hope
not
your
honor
and
i
believe
it
should
not
be
regarded
this
moot.
first
of
all,
although
i’m
not
sure,
i
know
in
ogilvie
versus
moore
recently
decided
by
this
court
election
had
passed.
whether
prayer
was
for
declaratory
relief,
i
don’t
recall
at
this
point.
if
it
was
not,
i
would
certainly
say
as
authority
at
this
time.
your
honor,
i
believe
the
mootness
rule
is
a
rule,
a
judicial
rule
not
mandated
necessarily
by
the
constitution
although
perhaps
by
the
case
in
controversy
rule
the
constitution.
but
in
any
event,
we
have
had
in
this
case,
a
case
that
was
tested
to
three
lower
courts
as
a
completely
adversarial
proceeding.
the
appellees
here
were
--
at
every
proceeding
filed
briefs,
i
argued
the
case,
i
can
assure
you
it
was
haughtily
contested.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
they
decided
the
constitutional
issue,
your
honor.
the
appellees,
one
of
the
appellees
makes
the
suggestion
that
the
dismissal
there
was
because
they
couldn’t
grant
relief
but
if
that
was
so,
i
think
they
would
have
said
so.
they
said
that
they
found
no
substantial
constitutional
issue
involved.
i
think
it
has
been
litigated
and
litigated
solely
on
the
merits
through
three
courts
below.
secondly,
i
like
to
point
out
that
election
cases
are
treated
differently,
i
believe,
than
other
cases.
election
cases
are
peculiarly
difficult
to
get
complete
and
adequate
review
on.
they
just
are
as
effective
length.
it’s
the
--
naturally
the
opponent
in
election
case
wants
to
delay,
he
wants
to
get
the
election
over
and
so
it’s
just
almost
impossible
to
get
adequate
complete
review
on
these
cases
and
yet
the
question
comes
up
again.
this
is
not
a
question
that
will
be
finally
determined.
now,
if
this
court
does
not
resolve
it,
people
arise
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
if
that
is
possible
i’m
going
to
request
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
sir
i
don’t
have
specific
authority
as
to
the
capability
of
the
court
to
do
that.
i
do
say
this
that
this
is
not
an
unnecessary
question.
that
is
a
question
that
will
come
up
again
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
we
did
not
include
an
allegation
in
the
court
below
when
this
case
was
submitted
should
not
be
determined
of
this
issue.
the
--
this
is
not
an
academic
question
as
i
say.
it
will
come
up
again.
election
matters
tend
to
recur
and
many
times
the
courts
have
said
that
where
it’s
a
matter
of
great
and
public
importance,
where
it
transcends
the
individual
case,
we
will
go
ahead
and
decide
this
point
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
to
preserve
the
electoral
process
to
enhance
it
and
the
cases
to
that
effect
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
didn’t
here
the
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
sir
we
--
what
we
said
and
what
we
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
we
want
this
court
to
say,
your
honor
that
the
courts
below
were
in
error
that
they
should
have
held
that
the
7%
requirement
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
1%
requirement
was
in
effect.
now,
what
we
are
asking
is
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
that
was
what
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir.
that
he
should
have
been
granted
valid
status.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
we
do
cite
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
that
is
true.
however,
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit
is
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
the
thrust
of
our
lawsuit
has
always
been
that
the
1%
requirement
was
appropriate
and
the
7%
was
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
sir,
the
--
we
say
this.
that
the
60-year
history
shows
that
it
had
been
an
existence
for
60
years
that
there
was
no
need
for
an
increase.
now,
i’m
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
it
sanctify
or
hold
that
the
1%
requirements
constitutional
because
i
don’t
think
that
its
quite
the
issue
here
because
--
and
i’m
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
whether
1%
could
be
said
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
asking
the
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
legislature
here.
what
i
we’re
saying
is
this
that
where
there
has
been
this
type
of
history
and
no
interference
or
disruption,
the
legislature
cannot
just
increase
--
make
increase
at
sevenfold
driving
independents
and
minorities
parties
off
the
ballot.
they
cannot
show
a
justification
for
this
increase.
now
as
to
the
validity
of
the
1%
requirement
itself,
i
take
it
that
could
be
the
subject
of
litigation
sometime,
if
so
i
wanted
to
litigate
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
entirely
clear
on
that
mr.
justice,
i
can
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
again
i
have
to
respond
to
my
historical
argument
that
this
was
not
great
participation
that
it
was
hardly
any
independent
activity
and
the
raise
at
sevenfold
just
about
ended
independent
activity
and
also
as
a
historical
fact
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir
and
of
course
if
we
cannot
prevail
here,
i’m
sure
that
4%
statute
is
going
to
be
subject
of
litigation.
we’d
like
to
avoid
that
if
we
could.
we’d
like
to
avoid
another
long
process
litigation
when
we
think
the
issues
could
not
be
presented
any
differently
to
this
court
if
it
came
back
again.
i
cannot
conceive
of
the
question
being
different
at
all
before
this
court
if
it
were
brought
back
again.
i
think
the
exactly
the
same
contending
issues
would
be
before
the
court
if
it
came
back.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i’m
not
clear,
your
honor
whether
he
will
or
not.
certainly,
in
the
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes
sir,
i
think
it’s
possible.
he
might,
he’s
had
a
taste
of
it
and
he
–
it
wasn’t
very
successful.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well,
he
was
able
to
run
as
a
write-in
candidate
of
course.
thanks
to
the
relief
we
got
from
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
socialist
labor
party
case.
i’m
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
case
carroll
versus
princess
anne
recalling
that.
but
i
recall
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
relief
could
not
be
granted.
i
believe
it
was
an
injunction
case
and
as
to
whether
or
not,
that
was
a
declaratory
judgment.
prayer
in
that,
i’m
not
sure
but
i
do
remember
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
was
the
question
as
considered
of
such
public
importance
that
this
court
decided
it.
now,
in
addition
to
the
history
which
we
believe
is
a
vital
importance
here.
this
court
has
held
in
this
area,
in
the
area
of
the
election
cases
three
principles
i
believe.
number
one,
is
that
there
is
sanctity
in
the
individual
ballot
that
every
man’s
vote
is
equal
the
others
and
that
our
guarantee
is
the
right
to
cast
an
effective
ballot.
secondly,
that
constitution
guarantees
free
and
equal
competition
in
areas,
ideas,
and
governmental
policy
in
the
electoral
process.
the
first
amendment
in
the
election
process
are
inextricably
intertwined.
and
finally,
that
minority
and
independent
candidates
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
needless
disadvantage.
now
in
determining
whether
a
statute
can
pass
constitutional
master
in
this
area,
the
court
has
said
it
will
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
law.
look
at
what
the
state
claims
to
be
protecting
and
look
at
the
interests
that
are
disadvantaged
by
the
law.
and
to
allow
verdicts,
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
suggest
no
state
interest
can
be
advanced,
has
not
been
advanced
or
could
be
advanced
for
the
sevenfold
or
the
fourfold
increase.
we
hope
the
court
will
act,
will
indicate
that
the
1%
was
a
sealing
but
beyond
which
the
legislature
could
not
go.
help
us
restore
some
health
to
the
ohio
election
process.
free
as
--
so
that
in
the
oncoming
months,
the
legislature
can
take
further
action
if
they
want
to
or
so
that
independents
can
participate,
minority
parties
can
participate
in
the
election
process.
otherwise,
the
result
is
going
to
be
--
people
will
be
frozen
off
the
ballot
and
that
there
will
be
a
necessity
of
further
litigation
on
a
question
that
is
squarely
before
the
court
on
this
record.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
not
your
honor.
i
believe
not.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
believe
no,
i
believe
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
that.
the
constitution
is
neutral
on
parties.
it
does
not
enshrine
them
to
give
them
any
special
sanctity.
now,
i
do
not
maintain
today
that
some
regulation
cannot
be
placed
as
to
obtaining
ballot
status,
but
i
say
it
must
be
minimal.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
well
i
say
this
that
--
and
i
want
to
be
perfectly
clear
on
this,
i’m
not
saying
that
this
court
--
this
case
requires
this
court
to
say
1%
is
constitutional.
it
asks
only
that
this
court
to
say
an
increase
beyond
1%
in
view
of
a
history
was
unconstitutional.
now
someday,
someone
may
be
able
to
present
a
case,
litigated
case,
present
a
record
to
a
court
which
would
hold,
which
will
lead
it
to
hold
that
the
1%
is
unconstitutional.
i’m
not
asking
today
for
endorsement
of
that
1%.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
very,
very
high.
you’ll
remember
that
in
footnote
9,
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
the
court
noted
that
42
other
states
require
1%
for
third
parties.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
but
if
there
--
only
require
parties
to
require
1%,
the
party
is
a
structure
as
to
an
organization
is
the
one
to
obtain
ballot
status.
how
much
harder
is
it
to
require
7%
from
an
independent
candidate?
the
other
states
in
our
research
are
much
lower.
much
lower
and
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
no
sir
it
is
not.
i
believe
that
we
got
in
to
that
question
in
the
socialist
labor
party
brief
and
i
am
not
--
i
am
going
by
memory
on
that.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
might
make
some
comments,
first
of
all
on
the
statements
from
appellees’
counsel.
i
do
not
believe
that
a
candidate
for
office
has
to
be
able
to
show
that
he
can
win.
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
socialist
labor
party
case
pointed
out
that
the
right
of
free
speech
is
the
right
also
to
be
wrong.
and
we
said
that
anybody
that
manifests
a
degree
of
sincerity
about
this
candidacy
is
entitled
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
other
people
might
consider
that
candidacy
frivolous
or
pointless
whatever.
it’s
part
of
our
basic
framework
of
our
society
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
suffrage
and
to
offer
themselves
as
a
candidate.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
was
achieved
by
the
williams-rhodes
case
in
the
three-judge
district
court.
that
is
right.
i
would
point
out
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
with
the
exception
of
--
if
you
are
running
for
president,
he
would
have
to
--
well
now,
ohio
requires
filing
of
declaration
intent
to
serve
shortly
before.
let
me
point
out
that
williams
and
rhodes
notes
that
write-in
is
not
a
comparable
to
ballot
status
that
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
points
out
it’s
a
disability,
the
majority
opinion
points
out
that
it
cannot
be
compared
and
that
is
a
definite
disadvantage
to
a
candidacy.
the
reduction
of
4%
in
the
ohio
legislature
came
after
this
court
and
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
the
guideline
--
the
only
guideline
we
are
advancing
here
is
when
that
history
is
offered.
history
has
pointed
out
the
guideline
in
this
case.
let
me
point
out
also
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
legislature
is
failed
to
act
as
was
the
case
in
the
reapportionment
cases
where
the
legislature
failed
to
reapportion.
this
is
a
case
where
the
legislature
is
acted
twice
in
ohio
and
against
the
interest
of
independent
candidates
and
minority
party
candidates.
this
is
a
case
that
particularly
requires
to
relief
that
this
court
can
require,
can
give.
there
are
no
independents
in
ohio
legislature.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that
could
be
so
your
honor.
in
williams
and
rhodes,
the
court
spoke
of
it
as
a
remote
danger.
nothing
in
the
case
that
it
does
exists
and
cited
on
mine
workers
case
from
illinois.
he
is
saying
that
these
rights
cannot
be
infringed
on
a
speculative
danger.
i
think
that
the
intelligence
of
the
legislature
is
equal
to
that
sort
of
problem,
if
it
became
a
problem.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
it
was
or
will
become
a
problem,
and
i
would
hate
to
defy
bona
fide
candidate
for
the
court.
i
think
that
probably
an
attack
the
court
should
take
this
one
noted
in
williams
versus
rhodes,
the
parties
have
to
begin,
people
have
to
begin
somewhere.
there
should
be
allowed
a
free
and
equal
chance
to
engage
in
a
competition
of
our
electoral
process.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
i
don’t
know,
not
about
him
in
nature
your
honor
but
i
suppose
that
it
might
discourage
some
people.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
certainly
if
there
where
a
showing
your
honor
that
this
was
happening.
that
people
were
being
discouraged
from
voting
or
confused
to
something
like
that,
this
case
--
the
situation
will
be
entirely
different.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
that’s
right
your
honor.
because
the
holding
of
this
court
is
that
where
fundamental
liberties
are
involved,
the
inquiry
will
be
made
as
to
what
interest
the
state
is
protecting.
this
court
is
the
defender
of
individuals,
minority
rights
and
it
looks
when
these
people’s
rights
are
burdened
or
restricted;
it
looks
to
the
interests
that
the
state
is
against
it.
mr.
benjamin
b.
sheerer
yes,
sir
it
is.
