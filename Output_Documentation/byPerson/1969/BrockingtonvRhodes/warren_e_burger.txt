e.

is
there
any
alternative?
chief

warren
e.
burger
to
get
on
the
final
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
what
i
think
we
were
concerned
about
you
said
in
response
to
justice
stewart’s
question
that
he
may
have
to
get
a
majority
in
his
primary.
chief

warren
e.
burger
many
thousands
of
votes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
we
now
treat
it
as
though
you
had
sought
a
declaratory
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
authority
do
you
suggest
we
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
say
that
it
is
not
a
permissible
or
valid
state
interest
to
take
some
measures
to
preclude
multiple
splinter
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
many
parties
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
if
one
--
you
thought
1%
was
all
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sheerer.
mr.
macklin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
material
in
your
brief?
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

mr.
sheerer
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
did
i
understand
you
say
before
that
there
is
no
prohibition
against
the
so-called
sticker
or
write-in
candidate
under
the
present
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
this
candidate,
your
client
could
be
a
write-in
candidate
in
any
election
for
any
office,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
counsel
of
that
the
excessively
long
ballots
sometimes
called
the
bed
sheet
ballot
has
the
tendency
to
discourage
people
from
voting?
would
you
accept
that
as
a
fact
of
life?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
widely
thought
that
political
scientists
and
other
expert
servers
that
is
so.
now,
assuming
them
for
a
moment
that
that
is
correct,
do
you
that
the
state
of
ohio
does
not
have
a
valid
interest
in
preventing
that
situation
for
proliferating
and
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
must
make
that
showing,
the
legislature
when
it
fixes
a
4%
or
3%
or
5%
or
1%?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
in
effect
that
1%
is
not
unconstitutionally
burdensome
but
the
4%
is
and
in
effect
you
are
saying
that
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
ohio
is
an
erroneous
judgment
by
that
difference.
