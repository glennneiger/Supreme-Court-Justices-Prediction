mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
discuss
first
on
the
standing
question.
and
after
i've
dealt
with
that
standing
question,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
mootness
question.
and
before
i
go
into
a
discussion
of
our
particular
problems,
i'll
answer
very
quickly
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
there
is
no
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
charging
party
that
turned
out
proceedings
to
appeal
of
an
adverse
decision.
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
they're
going
again
three
instances
in
which
a
charging
party
sought
to
appeal
independently
from
the
regional
director,
from
an
adverse
decision
of
district
court.
this
is
one
of
them.
the
other
case
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
found
to
be
mooted
by
the
fact
that
the
board
had
issue
its
decision,
and
the
third
case
is
another
serious
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
the
court
has
also
found
to
be
mooted
and
i'm
told,
i
was
told
yesterday
that's
presently
pending
on
petition
for
reconsideration
or
rehearing.
the
other
case
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
the
other
case
that
mr.
justice
harlan
may
have
had
in
mind
was
the
general
electric
case
that
involved
the
10
(j),
the
discretionary
provision
and
it
did
not
involved
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
no
question
of
standing
in
that
case
your
honor.
we
had
gotten
--
board
had
gotten
an
injunction
in
that
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
got
an
injunction
in
that
case
and
the
company
took
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
under
section
10
(f)
of
the
act,
it
is
--
if
it
is
agreed
by
the
board's
final
order
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
may
of
course
seek
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
decided
that
question
in
scofield,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
scofield,
this
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
we
--
in
scofield,
this
court
held
that
both
the
successful
charging
party,
as
well
as
the
successful
charged
party
had
the
right
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
take
the
case
up
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that's
exclusively
up
to
the
board.
under
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
only
the
board
may
bring
an
action
to
enforce
its
order.
now,
a
party
which
has
lost
before
the
board
may
bring
a
petition
to
review
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
board's
adverse
decision
has
an
aggrieved
party.
that
may
be
either
the
charging
party
who
didn't
succeed
before
the
board,
or
it
may
be
of
course
the
charged
party
who
lost
before
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
10
(l).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
corrected
your
honor.
and
in
the
henderson
case,
which
is
recently
come
down
--
which
is
recently
come
down
and
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
i
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
--
i
forgot
it
at
the
moment.
the
food
employers
council
there
was
named
as
an
appellee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
council
was
the
charging
party
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
name
threw
me
off
your
honor
in
that
particular
case.
it
was
not
the
regional
director
who
took
up
the
appeal.
it
was
the
retail
clerks
who
took
an
appeal.
the
retail
clerks
where
the
--
where
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
where
is
that
case
here?
well,
my
recollection
was
that
it
was
just
that
that
was
the
union
who
appeal
in
that
case
and
then
we
went
in
there
to
defend
our
own
position.
and
whatever,
whatever
may
be
said
of
that
case
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
the
latest
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
they
said,
in
which
it
said
that
although
the
question
of
the
charging
party
standing
to
appeal
was
broached
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
they
nevertheless
had
now
concluded
that
the
charging
party
does
not
have
the
status
of
a
party,
of
a
full
party
where
the
right
of
appeal
and
they've
lined
up
for
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
particular
case.
now,
if
i
may
get
back
now
for
a
moment
to
develop
my
argument
with
respect
to
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner's
case
that
a
charging
party
in
a
10
(l)
proceedings
is
entitled
to
seek
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
district
court
independently
of
the
regional
director,
it
seems
to
me
rest
essentially
upon
the
predicate
--
upon
the
predicate
that
a
charging
party
with
certain
qualifications
that
the
petitioner
here
has
indicated
as
a
status
of
a
full
party
in
those
proceeding
--
in
those
proceedings.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
predicate,
that
predicate
misconceives
the
statutory
scheme
and
also
fails
to
accord
proper
way
to
the
legislative
history
that
gave
birth
to
section
10
(l).
in
our
view,
under
the
statute,
a
charging
party
plays
a
subordinate
role
in
a
10
(l)
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
it's
--
congress
vested
upon
the
charging
party.
the
limited
role
of
assisting
and
aiding
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
of
the
case
by
the
regional
director,
but
that
it
is
the
regional
director
who
contains
or
retains
control
not
only
over
the
initiation,
not
only
over
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
but
also
retains
control
of
the
litigation
at
all
stages
both
the
appellate
--
both
the
trial
stages,
as
well
as
the
appellate
stage.
now,
section
10
(l)
represents
one
of
the
many
compromises
that
is
to
be
found
in
this
statute.
and
as
in
the
case
of
other
labor
act
compromises
which
have
engage
the
attention
of
this
court,
the
meaning
of
section
10
(l)
and
the
role
which
a
charging
party
was
to
play
in
the
proceedings
can
only
be
fully
determined
by
going
back
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
it's
not
wholly
amiss
to
say
that
in
the
case
like
this,
a
page
of
legislative
history
does
outweigh
a
book
of
logic.
section
10
(l)
became
a
part
of
the
act
as
mr.
smetana
has
indicated
in
1947
when
congress
adopted
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
including
the
restrictions
against
secondary
boycotts
and
strikes
over
jurisdictional
disputes.
in
the
course
of
that
delay,
congress
took
note
of
the
fact
that
the
administrative
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
before
the
board
where
unduly
and
unavoidably
time-consuming.
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
felt
that
in
the
speedier
remedy
was
required
in
the
public
interest
rather
than
a
board
order
or
a
court
decree
enforcing
that
board
order.
the
debate
over
the
need
and
the
means
for
achieving
this
kind
of
speedy
relief
was
particularly
acute
in
the
area
of
secondary
boycotts
as
jurisdictional
disputes.
the
senate
labor
committee
had
reported
a
bill
which
contained
a
provision
virtually
identical
with
section
10
(l)
of
the
statute.
now
senator's
ball,
joined
particularly
by
senator
taft,
senator
o'daniel
and
also
by
senator
wherry
of
nebraska,
i
should
have
added
also
senator
--
i
did
said
senator
o'daniel.
they
were
critical.
they
were
critical
of
the
section
10
(l)
provision
which
was
contained
in
the
senate
bill,
the
bill
that
have
been
reported
by
the
senate
committee
because
he
felt
that
it
was
inadequate,
wholly
inadequate
to
give
an
employer
who
is
involved
in
the
secondary
dispute,
or
was
involved
in
the
jurisdictional
disputes
that
kind
of
speedy
relief,
that
kind
of
relief
that
they
thought
he
was
entire
--
entitled
to.
they
were
critical
of
the
senate
committee
bill
because
as
senators
ball,
taft,
and
o'daniel
said
in
their
supplemental
views
--
their
supplemental
views
to
the
senate
labor
committee's
report.
as
they
said
there,
“it
depends
upon
the
decision
of
the
board
as
to
whether
any
action
shall
be
taken
and
the
conduct
of
the
proceedings
would
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
board
attorneys
instead
of
attorneys
of
the
injured
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
entire
legislative
history
that
the
fight
was
much
deeper
than
that,
it
was
not
merely
a
question
about
who
is
going
to
initiate
this
thing
but
who
was
going
to
reach
--
have
control
not
only
over
the
initiation
of
the
case
but
at
the
prosecution
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
because
at
that
point,
at
that
point,
the
regional
director
who
initiated
the
case
may
conclude
for
various
reasons,
now
i
come
to
those
later,
may
conclude
that
there
is
really,
it's
no
longer
appropriate.
it's
no
longer
appropriate
to
continue
to
press
at
the
appellate
stage
for
an
injunction
on
basis
of
the
kind
of
record
that
was
made
in
the
court
below,
on
the
basis
of
what
kind
of
issues
were
involved
there.
if
the
regional
director
decides
not
to
go
on
but
the
charging
party
may
go
on,
the
charging
party
has
really
taken
control
of
the
litigation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
litigation
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
perhaps
not
but
if
they
say,
the
regional
director
decides
that
on
the
basis
of
whatever
record
has
been
made
before
the
court
--
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
issues
that
are
involved
in,
he
may
still
continue
to
press
the
complaint.
he
may
so
continue
to
press
the
complaint
before
the
board,
before
the
board
either
with
the
expectation
that
a
better
record
may
be
made
before
the
board
or
that
the
board
may
see
the
facts
differently
--
may
see
the
facts
differently
that
the
district
court
did
because
the
district
court
decision
is
not
binding
upon
the
board
under
merits.
but
at
that
point
however,
the
regional
director
has
made
a
decision
that
it
is
no
longer
appropriate
to
press
for
an
injunction
at
the
appellate
stage.
the
statute
requires
--
the
statute
requires
a
regional
director
whenever
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
have
merit.
he
is
required
to
go
into
the
district
court
to
seek
an
injunction
but
the
statute
does
not
require.
the
statute
does
not
require
a
regional
director
to
go
on
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
district
court.
now,
if
you
permit
the
charging
party,
if
you
permit
the
charging
party
to
say,
well,
independently
taken
appeal
despite
the
failure
of
the
regional
director
to
take
an
appeal,
in
effect
what
you've
done,
you
transformed
--
you
transformed
what
is
a
government
piece,
government
litigation
into
a
private,
into
a
private
lawsuit.
and
indeed,
indeed
the
petitioner
in
its
brief,
i
think
almost
virtually
concedes
at
that
point
almost
becomes
a
private
lawsuit.
now,
to
be
sure
--
to
be
sure
that
petitioner
is
arguing
--
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
it
is
confined
to
the
theory
of
the
case
originally
advanced
by
the
regional
director
and
that
is
confined
also
to
the
kind
of
relief
that
the
regional
director
is
asking
but
i
suggest
your
honor
that
once
the
regional
director
is
out
of
the
picture,
and
the
charging
party
is
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
take
an
appeal
that
then
it
truly
has
become
a
private
piece
of
litigation
rather
than
a
government
litigation
and
congress,
and
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
let
me
take
one
case.
let
us
assume
that
when
the
charges
are
filed,
the
investigations
been
made,
the
regional
director
concludes
that
there's
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
have
merit
and
that
a
complaint
were
issued,
yes,
he
is
mandated
by
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
is
mandated
by
the
statute
here
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
to
go
under
the
district
court
to
seek
an
injunction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
on
the
basis
of
the
developments
in
the
district
court,
he
may
conclude,
he
may
conclude
that
there's
no
longer
any
merit
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
that
there's
no
longer
any
basis
for
injunctive
relief.
in
other
words,
with
that
kind
of
a
record,
having
been
made
in
the
district
court,
he
may
because
they
conclude
that
he's
got
no
case
at
all
anymore
and
congress
did
not
require
them
to
sticky
with
the
case
willy-nilly
nor
did
congress
require
him
to
take
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
a
district
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
what
--
if
he
concludes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
think
it
does.
let's
say
that
he
files
a
petition
now,
and
10
minutes
after
he's
filed
the
petition
a
piece
of
evidence
which
was
critical
to
his
case,
it
suddenly
is
exposed.
it
isn't
there
anymore.
it
isn't
there
anymore
and
the
piece
of
evidence
is
critical
to
his
case.
he
is
free
to
withdraw.
he
is
free
to
withdraw
that
because
he's
got
no
case
anymore
under
the
merits.
he
won't
issue
a
complaint.
there's
no
reasonable
cause
to
issue
a
complaint
to
go
to
the
board
and
having
no
reasonable
cause
to
issue
a
complaint
or
at
least
he
would
withdraw
the
complaint
if
that
were
to
happen,
then
there's
no
basis
anymore
for
an
injunctive
relief
by
the
district
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
a
rare
case,
your
honor
when
that
will
happen.[laughter]
it's
a
rare
case
indeed
when
that
will
happen
but
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
could
he
withdraw
10
minutes
later?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
yes,
it
doesn't
happen.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
i
can
safely
say,
i
know
of
no
case
where
ten
minutes
after
we
filed
a
petition
for
an
injunction,
we
withdrew.[laughter]
well,
if
i
may
go
on
a
little
bit
more
here
with
this
legislative
history
because
i
think
it's
important.
this
legislative
history
and
i
can
only
touch
the
highlights
of
it
to
indicate
what
the
scope
of
the
debate
and
the
intensiveness
of
the
debate
as
to
who
was
going
to
be
in
charge
of
this
particular
litigation?
and
senator
o'daniel
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
i've
already
read
from
the
supplemental
views
of
senators
taft
and
ball
and
senator
o'daniel
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
he
said,
he
saw
no
reason
under
heaven
why
the
decision
to
seek
injunctive
relief
and
control
of
the
litigation
should
be
exclusively
vested
in
a
board
representative
rather
than
an
injured
party
and
the
senator
wherry
added,
the
injured
party
and
i
want
to
quote
this,
“should
not
have
to
depend
upon
the
judgment
of
some
bureaucrat
in
whom
it
lies
the
power
to
determine
why
such
a
course
should
be
followed.”
and
again
they
strongly
urged
to
senator
o'daniel
that
the
injured
parties
should
have
and
i
want
to
quote
this
once
more,
“should
have
the
right
to
control
its
own
litigation,
to
hire
its
own
lawyer,
to
take
such
steps
as
it
deems
proper
and
to
go
into
such
court
as
it
deems
proper
to
proceed
in.”
now,
to
achieve
this
purpose,
senator
ball
introduced
his
amendment
and
under
his
amendment,
he
introduced
the
amendment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
under
his
amendment,
the
charge
--
a
party
who
was
suffering
from
a
secondary
boycott
or
a
jurisdictional
dispute
strike
would
have
the
right
independently
to
go
into
a
district
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relief.
that
proposal
encountered
strong
opposition.
some
members
of
the
opposition
were
unwilling
to
permit
injunctions
whether
at
the
request
of
private
parties
or
at
the
request
of
the
other
government.
but
the
opposition
was
subtlety
and
i
might
say,
they
vehemently
opposed
to
any
provision
that
would
permit
a
private
party
to
go
and
seek
an
injunctive
relief
in
these
kind
--
in
these
type
of
cases
because
--
because
they
feared
a
revival,
a
resurrection
of
some
of
the
evils
that
had
led
to
norris-la-guardia.
they
were
willing
--
they
were
willing
to
relax
the
restriction
of
norris-la-guardia
only
if,
only
if
the
exclusive
authority
to
initiate
and
to
control
the
litigation
at
10
(l)
proceeding
was
vested
in
the
board.
now,
the
difference
between
the
two
groups
was
taken
care
of.
it
was
taken
--
it
was
resolved
through
a
compromise
that
senator
taft
proposed
as
a
substitute,
as
a
substitute
for
the
ball
amendment
which
would
have
given
a
private
party
the
right
to
independently
go
into
a
district
court
and
get
an
injunction
as
the
substitute
for
that,
senator
taft
proposed
what
is
now
section
303
of
the
act.
and
section
303
of
the
act
permits
an
injured
party
to
go
into
a
court
in
order
to
get
damages.
the
ball
amendment
was
overwhelmingly
defeated
by
a
vote
of
something
like
62
to
28
and
section
10
(l)
of
course
was
retained
in
its
present
form.
and
senator
taft
after
the
conference
committee
had
approved
section
10
(l)
and
section
303
provision
of
the
statute
explained
that
compromise
senator
taft
said
that
under
that
compro
--
under
his
proposal,
the
compromise
which
had
been
accepted,
the
injured
party
was
given
“simply
a
right
of
suit
for
damages”
caused
by
secondary
boycotts
or
jurisdiction
disputes
but
that
in
such
cases,
again
i
want
to
quote,
“the
injunction
can
be
obtained
only
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
think
what
emerges
from
this
legislative
history
is
that
congress
agreed
to
a
narrow
exceptions
of
norris-la-guardia
which
vested
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
board
or
the
regional
director,
i
used
the
terms
interchangeably,
which
vested
exclusively
control
in
the
board
over
the
--
not
only
the
initiation
but
the
control
of
the
litigation
at
all
stages.
the
private
party,
the
injured
party
was
given
simply
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
and
in
section
10
(l),
in
section
10
(l),
congress
assigned
a
subordinate
role
to
the
charging
party
of
merely
aiding
and
assisting
in
the
conduct
of
the
10
(l)
proceedings
by
the
regional
director,
but
it
was
the
regional
director
who
remained
in
control
and
as
i
said
earlier,
the
fight
between
the
proponents
of
the
ball
amendment
and
the
--
and
those
who
opposed
it
was
not
simply
a
fight
where
who
is
going
to
have
control
over
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings,
the
fight
went
much
deeper.
the
fight
was
who
would
be
in
control
of
that
kind
of
litigation,
the
injured
party
or
the
board?
and
congress
answered
that
question
firmly
in
favor
of
the
board
and
i
believe
that
its
action
indicates
that
congress
withheld
from
the
charging
party
the
status
of
a
--
of
a
party,
the
status
of
a
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
status
of
a
party
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
--
that
may
well
be,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it
answers
it
when
you
take
into
account
what
it
was.
what
it
was
that
the
--
what
i'll
call
the
proponents
of
section
(l),
sought
to
accomplish
when
they
adopted
section
10
(l)
and
opposed,
and
opposed
the
ball
amendment.
they
were
fearful,
they
were
fearful
to
give
the
charging
party
any
kind
of
an
independent
right,
independent
right
to
press
for
and
to
seek
an
injunction
or
to
press
for
injunction
and
as
i
said
earlier,
if
the
regional
director
concludes
after
he
has
carried
out
the
mandated
duty
of
going
into
a
district
court,
that
in
the
face
of
that
adverse
decision
and
because
of
other
considerations
i'll
spell
out
in
a
moment,
he
concludes
that
it's
no
longer
appropriate
to
seek
injunctive
or
to
press
for
injunctive
relief
then
the
charging
party
has
taken
charge
of
that
litigation
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
kind
of
control
that
congress
was
talking
about
would
have
--
would
exclude,
would
exclude
the
charging
party
from
going
on
upstairs
and
seeking
to
press
for
an
injunctive
relief.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
already
your
honor.
in
the
senate
bill,
that
is
in
the
bill
reported
by
the
senate
committee,
yes
that
was
already
in
there.
that
was
already
in
there.
as
matter
of
fact,
i
might
add
that
the
--
that
the
house
had
passed
the
bill
which
permitted
both
the
government
or
the
private
party
to
seek
injunctive
relief
but
that
felt
by
the
way
sad
because
eventually
the
conference
committee
agreed,
agreed
with
the
senate
that
section
10
(l)
would
be
adopted.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
must
confess,
i'm
a
little
bit
taken
by
surprise
by
your
question
that
we
were,
that
we
appealed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
read
from
the
retail
clerks.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
retail
clerks
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
director
and
various
locals
of
the
retail
clerks.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh!
i'm
sorry.[laughter]
this
is
an
appeal
--
i
didn't
need
to
hide
it.[laughter]
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
regional
director
of
the
board
and
various
local
of
the
retail
clerks
from
district
court
order
granting
a
temporary
injunction
pursuant
to
petition
by
the
regional
director.
now,
on
page
528,
528
says,
“the
appellants
petition
to
this
court
for
a
stay
of
the
injunction”
and
i
take
it
the
appellants
must
admit
both
us
and
the
retail
clerks.
this
petition
was
denied
but
he
granted
an
expedited
hearing.
by
the
same
order,
this
court
denied
the
charging
parties
in
the
board
proceedings
permission
to
intervene
as
appellees
but
granted
them
permission
to
appear
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
caption
is
appellants,
retail
clerks
the
appellants,
and
ralph
e.
kennedy,
regional
director
--
the
appellant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
says
appellant
here
on
the
--
at
the
top
of
the,
top
of
the
case.
it
says,
retail
clerks,
locals
--
various
sort
of
locals,
appellants
and
ralph
kennedy,
regional
director
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
labor
board,
appellant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
versus
--
excuse
me,
versus
food
employers
council,
appellee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
food
employers
council,
yes,
that
was
charging
party,
that
was
appellee.
and
the
court
says
with
respect
to
the
answers
by
the
same
order
this
court
denied
the
charging
parties
in
the
board
proceedings
permission
to
intervene
as
appellees
but
granted
them
permission
to
appear
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
that
is
our
argument
and
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
in
account
of
retail
clerks,
i
will
call
attention
once
more
to
the
henderson
case
which
a
court
just
decided
within
the
last
few
months
and
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
where
they
line
up
--
where
they
line
up
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
on
the
right
to
appeal,
but
i
think
those
are
the
underlying
considerations
really
as
to
why
they
don't
have
the
right
to
appeal.
well,
i
did
promise
at
the
beginning
though
i
haven't
covered
all
the
considerations
but
i
think
i
made
the
clear,
the
heart
of
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
power
to
appeal.
i
did
indicate
earlier
that
i
would
say
something
about
the
mootness
question
and
before
i
sit
down,
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
question.
i
see
my
light
is
flashing
and
i
don't
want
to
deprive
my
brother
of
any
time
unless
the
court
is
willing
to
give
me
a
few
more
minutes,
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
my
red
light,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
i
have
a
few
more
minutes,
so
i
can
talk
about
the
mootness?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alright,
sir.
thank
you.
the
statute
provides
that
a
district
court
may
grant
such
injunctive
relief
as
it
deems
just
in
proper
pending
the
board's
final
adjudication
with
respect
to
the
matter
whether
or
not
this
case
is
moot
depends
upon
what
do
we
mean
by
pending
final
adjudication
by
the
board,
by
or
the
matter
by
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
do
--
what
does
that
phrase
mean?
that
the
district
court
has
the
authority
to
grant
interlocutory
injunctive
relief
pending
at
the
final
adjudication
of
the
matter
by
the
board.
the
board
has
issued
its
decision
and
final
order
in
this
case
and
we
say
that
that
final
--
that
decision
and
final
order
of
the
board
is
the
final
adjudication
of
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
(l)
and
with
the
issuance
of
the
--
and
with
the
issuance
of
the
board's
decision
which
as
i
say,
constitutes
this
final
adjudication
the
power
of
the
district
court,
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
grant
any
kind
of
injunctive
relief
in
this
case
is
that
an
end.
now,
the
union
has
in
fact,
the
union
has
in
fact
stopped
the
picketing.
as
i
said,
the
board's
decision
and
order
is
presently
pending
on
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
union
should
resume,
if
the
union
should
resume
its
picketing
in
defiance
of
the
board's
order,
the
board
is
empowered
under
section
10
(e)
and
(f)
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
for
such
temporary
relief
as
maybe
appropriate
in
the
circumstances.
it's
not
mandated,
but
it's
empowered
to
do
so
and
presumably
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
board's
order
in
this
case,
it
assured
that
the
board
should
proceed
very
long
in
seeking
to
get
some
kind
of
temporary
injunctive
relief
from
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
argument
that's
being
made
in
this
case
here
that
final
adjudication
by
the
board
and
i'll
be
through
in
just
a
few
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
argument
that's
being
made
in
this
case
here
that
final
adjudication
by
the
board
does
not
mean
--
the
decision
of
the
board
in
this
particular
case
but
that
the
case
is
not
finally
adjudicated
until
it's
run
its
entire
course
before
the
board
as
well
as
the
courts
and
i
may
briefly
ask
by
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
say
final
adjudication
by
the
reviewing
court,
it
says
final
adjudication
by
the
board.
we
think
the
case
is
moot
and
i
may
say
that
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
our
mootness
question
and
having
come
to
this
--
coming
this
far
because
well,
i
think
that
our
argument
on
the
mootness
is
very
strong,
at
the
same
time
i
would
like
to
have
an
answer
from
the
court
as
to
the
standing
of
the
charging
party
in
these
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
either
way,
your
honor,
either
way,[laughter]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
discuss
first
on
the
standing
question.
and
after
i've
dealt
with
that
standing
question,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
mootness
question.
and
before
i
go
into
a
discussion
of
our
particular
problems,
i'll
answer
very
quickly
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
there
is
no
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
charging
party
that
turned
out
proceedings
to
appeal
of
an
adverse
decision.
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
they're
going
again
three
instances
in
which
a
charging
party
sought
to
appeal
independently
from
the
regional
director,
from
an
adverse
decision
of
district
court.
this
is
one
of
them.
the
other
case
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
found
to
be
mooted
by
the
fact
that
the
board
had
issue
its
decision,
and
the
third
case
is
another
serious
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
the
court
has
also
found
to
be
mooted
and
i'm
told,
i
was
told
yesterday
that's
presently
pending
on
petition
for
reconsideration
or
rehearing.
the
other
case
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
the
other
case
that
mr.
justice
harlan
may
have
had
in
mind
was
the
general
electric
case
that
involved
the
10
(j),
the
discretionary
provision
and
it
did
not
involved
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
no
question
of
standing
in
that
case
your
honor.
we
had
gotten
--
board
had
gotten
an
injunction
in
that
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
got
an
injunction
in
that
case
and
the
company
took
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
under
section
10
(f)
of
the
act,
it
is
--
if
it
is
agreed
by
the
board's
final
order
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
may
of
course
seek
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
decided
that
question
in
scofield,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
scofield,
this
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
we
--
in
scofield,
this
court
held
that
both
the
successful
charging
party,
as
well
as
the
successful
charged
party
had
the
right
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
take
the
case
up
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that's
exclusively
up
to
the
board.
under
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
only
the
board
may
bring
an
action
to
enforce
its
order.
now,
a
party
which
has
lost
before
the
board
may
bring
a
petition
to
review
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
board's
adverse
decision
has
an
aggrieved
party.
that
may
be
either
the
charging
party
who
didn't
succeed
before
the
board,
or
it
may
be
of
course
the
charged
party
who
lost
before
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
10
(l).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
corrected
your
honor.
and
in
the
henderson
case,
which
is
recently
come
down
--
which
is
recently
come
down
and
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
i
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
--
i
forgot
it
at
the
moment.
the
food
employers
council
there
was
named
as
an
appellee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
council
was
the
charging
party
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
name
threw
me
off
your
honor
in
that
particular
case.
it
was
not
the
regional
director
who
took
up
the
appeal.
it
was
the
retail
clerks
who
took
an
appeal.
the
retail
clerks
where
the
--
where
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
where
is
that
case
here?
well,
my
recollection
was
that
it
was
just
that
that
was
the
union
who
appeal
in
that
case
and
then
we
went
in
there
to
defend
our
own
position.
and
whatever,
whatever
may
be
said
of
that
case
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
the
latest
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
they
said,
in
which
it
said
that
although
the
question
of
the
charging
party
standing
to
appeal
was
broached
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
they
nevertheless
had
now
concluded
that
the
charging
party
does
not
have
the
status
of
a
party,
of
a
full
party
where
the
right
of
appeal
and
they've
lined
up
for
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
particular
case.
now,
if
i
may
get
back
now
for
a
moment
to
develop
my
argument
with
respect
to
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner's
case
that
a
charging
party
in
a
10
(l)
proceedings
is
entitled
to
seek
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
district
court
independently
of
the
regional
director,
it
seems
to
me
rest
essentially
upon
the
predicate
--
upon
the
predicate
that
a
charging
party
with
certain
qualifications
that
the
petitioner
here
has
indicated
as
a
status
of
a
full
party
in
those
proceeding
--
in
those
proceedings.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
predicate,
that
predicate
misconceives
the
statutory
scheme
and
also
fails
to
accord
proper
way
to
the
legislative
history
that
gave
birth
to
section
10
(l).
in
our
view,
under
the
statute,
a
charging
party
plays
a
subordinate
role
in
a
10
(l)
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
it's
--
congress
vested
upon
the
charging
party.
the
limited
role
of
assisting
and
aiding
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
of
the
case
by
the
regional
director,
but
that
it
is
the
regional
director
who
contains
or
retains
control
not
only
over
the
initiation,
not
only
over
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
but
also
retains
control
of
the
litigation
at
all
stages
both
the
appellate
--
both
the
trial
stages,
as
well
as
the
appellate
stage.
now,
section
10
(l)
represents
one
of
the
many
compromises
that
is
to
be
found
in
this
statute.
and
as
in
the
case
of
other
labor
act
compromises
which
have
engage
the
attention
of
this
court,
the
meaning
of
section
10
(l)
and
the
role
which
a
charging
party
was
to
play
in
the
proceedings
can
only
be
fully
determined
by
going
back
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
it's
not
wholly
amiss
to
say
that
in
the
case
like
this,
a
page
of
legislative
history
does
outweigh
a
book
of
logic.
section
10
(l)
became
a
part
of
the
act
as
mr.
smetana
has
indicated
in
1947
when
congress
adopted
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
including
the
restrictions
against
secondary
boycotts
and
strikes
over
jurisdictional
disputes.
in
the
course
of
that
delay,
congress
took
note
of
the
fact
that
the
administrative
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
before
the
board
where
unduly
and
unavoidably
time-consuming.
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
felt
that
in
the
speedier
remedy
was
required
in
the
public
interest
rather
than
a
board
order
or
a
court
decree
enforcing
that
board
order.
the
debate
over
the
need
and
the
means
for
achieving
this
kind
of
speedy
relief
was
particularly
acute
in
the
area
of
secondary
boycotts
as
jurisdictional
disputes.
the
senate
labor
committee
had
reported
a
bill
which
contained
a
provision
virtually
identical
with
section
10
(l)
of
the
statute.
now
senator's
ball,
joined
particularly
by
senator
taft,
senator
o'daniel
and
also
by
senator
wherry
of
nebraska,
i
should
have
added
also
senator
--
i
did
said
senator
o'daniel.
they
were
critical.
they
were
critical
of
the
section
10
(l)
provision
which
was
contained
in
the
senate
bill,
the
bill
that
have
been
reported
by
the
senate
committee
because
he
felt
that
it
was
inadequate,
wholly
inadequate
to
give
an
employer
who
is
involved
in
the
secondary
dispute,
or
was
involved
in
the
jurisdictional
disputes
that
kind
of
speedy
relief,
that
kind
of
relief
that
they
thought
he
was
entire
--
entitled
to.
they
were
critical
of
the
senate
committee
bill
because
as
senators
ball,
taft,
and
o'daniel
said
in
their
supplemental
views
--
their
supplemental
views
to
the
senate
labor
committee's
report.
as
they
said
there,
“it
depends
upon
the
decision
of
the
board
as
to
whether
any
action
shall
be
taken
and
the
conduct
of
the
proceedings
would
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
board
attorneys
instead
of
attorneys
of
the
injured
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
entire
legislative
history
that
the
fight
was
much
deeper
than
that,
it
was
not
merely
a
question
about
who
is
going
to
initiate
this
thing
but
who
was
going
to
reach
--
have
control
not
only
over
the
initiation
of
the
case
but
at
the
prosecution
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
because
at
that
point,
at
that
point,
the
regional
director
who
initiated
the
case
may
conclude
for
various
reasons,
now
i
come
to
those
later,
may
conclude
that
there
is
really,
it's
no
longer
appropriate.
it's
no
longer
appropriate
to
continue
to
press
at
the
appellate
stage
for
an
injunction
on
basis
of
the
kind
of
record
that
was
made
in
the
court
below,
on
the
basis
of
what
kind
of
issues
were
involved
there.
if
the
regional
director
decides
not
to
go
on
but
the
charging
party
may
go
on,
the
charging
party
has
really
taken
control
of
the
litigation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
litigation
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
perhaps
not
but
if
they
say,
the
regional
director
decides
that
on
the
basis
of
whatever
record
has
been
made
before
the
court
--
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
issues
that
are
involved
in,
he
may
still
continue
to
press
the
complaint.
he
may
so
continue
to
press
the
complaint
before
the
board,
before
the
board
either
with
the
expectation
that
a
better
record
may
be
made
before
the
board
or
that
the
board
may
see
the
facts
differently
--
may
see
the
facts
differently
that
the
district
court
did
because
the
district
court
decision
is
not
binding
upon
the
board
under
merits.
but
at
that
point
however,
the
regional
director
has
made
a
decision
that
it
is
no
longer
appropriate
to
press
for
an
injunction
at
the
appellate
stage.
the
statute
requires
--
the
statute
requires
a
regional
director
whenever
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
have
merit.
he
is
required
to
go
into
the
district
court
to
seek
an
injunction
but
the
statute
does
not
require.
the
statute
does
not
require
a
regional
director
to
go
on
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
district
court.
now,
if
you
permit
the
charging
party,
if
you
permit
the
charging
party
to
say,
well,
independently
taken
appeal
despite
the
failure
of
the
regional
director
to
take
an
appeal,
in
effect
what
you've
done,
you
transformed
--
you
transformed
what
is
a
government
piece,
government
litigation
into
a
private,
into
a
private
lawsuit.
and
indeed,
indeed
the
petitioner
in
its
brief,
i
think
almost
virtually
concedes
at
that
point
almost
becomes
a
private
lawsuit.
now,
to
be
sure
--
to
be
sure
that
petitioner
is
arguing
--
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
it
is
confined
to
the
theory
of
the
case
originally
advanced
by
the
regional
director
and
that
is
confined
also
to
the
kind
of
relief
that
the
regional
director
is
asking
but
i
suggest
your
honor
that
once
the
regional
director
is
out
of
the
picture,
and
the
charging
party
is
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
take
an
appeal
that
then
it
truly
has
become
a
private
piece
of
litigation
rather
than
a
government
litigation
and
congress,
and
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
let
me
take
one
case.
let
us
assume
that
when
the
charges
are
filed,
the
investigations
been
made,
the
regional
director
concludes
that
there's
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
charges
have
merit
and
that
a
complaint
were
issued,
yes,
he
is
mandated
by
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
is
mandated
by
the
statute
here
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
to
go
under
the
district
court
to
seek
an
injunction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
on
the
basis
of
the
developments
in
the
district
court,
he
may
conclude,
he
may
conclude
that
there's
no
longer
any
merit
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
that
there's
no
longer
any
basis
for
injunctive
relief.
in
other
words,
with
that
kind
of
a
record,
having
been
made
in
the
district
court,
he
may
because
they
conclude
that
he's
got
no
case
at
all
anymore
and
congress
did
not
require
them
to
sticky
with
the
case
willy-nilly
nor
did
congress
require
him
to
take
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
a
district
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
what
--
if
he
concludes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
think
it
does.
let's
say
that
he
files
a
petition
now,
and
10
minutes
after
he's
filed
the
petition
a
piece
of
evidence
which
was
critical
to
his
case,
it
suddenly
is
exposed.
it
isn't
there
anymore.
it
isn't
there
anymore
and
the
piece
of
evidence
is
critical
to
his
case.
he
is
free
to
withdraw.
he
is
free
to
withdraw
that
because
he's
got
no
case
anymore
under
the
merits.
he
won't
issue
a
complaint.
there's
no
reasonable
cause
to
issue
a
complaint
to
go
to
the
board
and
having
no
reasonable
cause
to
issue
a
complaint
or
at
least
he
would
withdraw
the
complaint
if
that
were
to
happen,
then
there's
no
basis
anymore
for
an
injunctive
relief
by
the
district
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
a
rare
case,
your
honor
when
that
will
happen.[laughter]
it's
a
rare
case
indeed
when
that
will
happen
but
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
could
he
withdraw
10
minutes
later?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
yes,
it
doesn't
happen.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
i
can
safely
say,
i
know
of
no
case
where
ten
minutes
after
we
filed
a
petition
for
an
injunction,
we
withdrew.[laughter]
well,
if
i
may
go
on
a
little
bit
more
here
with
this
legislative
history
because
i
think
it's
important.
this
legislative
history
and
i
can
only
touch
the
highlights
of
it
to
indicate
what
the
scope
of
the
debate
and
the
intensiveness
of
the
debate
as
to
who
was
going
to
be
in
charge
of
this
particular
litigation?
and
senator
o'daniel
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
i've
already
read
from
the
supplemental
views
of
senators
taft
and
ball
and
senator
o'daniel
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
he
said,
he
saw
no
reason
under
heaven
why
the
decision
to
seek
injunctive
relief
and
control
of
the
litigation
should
be
exclusively
vested
in
a
board
representative
rather
than
an
injured
party
and
the
senator
wherry
added,
the
injured
party
and
i
want
to
quote
this,
“should
not
have
to
depend
upon
the
judgment
of
some
bureaucrat
in
whom
it
lies
the
power
to
determine
why
such
a
course
should
be
followed.”
and
again
they
strongly
urged
to
senator
o'daniel
that
the
injured
parties
should
have
and
i
want
to
quote
this
once
more,
“should
have
the
right
to
control
its
own
litigation,
to
hire
its
own
lawyer,
to
take
such
steps
as
it
deems
proper
and
to
go
into
such
court
as
it
deems
proper
to
proceed
in.”
now,
to
achieve
this
purpose,
senator
ball
introduced
his
amendment
and
under
his
amendment,
he
introduced
the
amendment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
under
his
amendment,
the
charge
--
a
party
who
was
suffering
from
a
secondary
boycott
or
a
jurisdictional
dispute
strike
would
have
the
right
independently
to
go
into
a
district
court
and
obtain
injunctive
relief.
that
proposal
encountered
strong
opposition.
some
members
of
the
opposition
were
unwilling
to
permit
injunctions
whether
at
the
request
of
private
parties
or
at
the
request
of
the
other
government.
but
the
opposition
was
subtlety
and
i
might
say,
they
vehemently
opposed
to
any
provision
that
would
permit
a
private
party
to
go
and
seek
an
injunctive
relief
in
these
kind
--
in
these
type
of
cases
because
--
because
they
feared
a
revival,
a
resurrection
of
some
of
the
evils
that
had
led
to
norris-la-guardia.
they
were
willing
--
they
were
willing
to
relax
the
restriction
of
norris-la-guardia
only
if,
only
if
the
exclusive
authority
to
initiate
and
to
control
the
litigation
at
10
(l)
proceeding
was
vested
in
the
board.
now,
the
difference
between
the
two
groups
was
taken
care
of.
it
was
taken
--
it
was
resolved
through
a
compromise
that
senator
taft
proposed
as
a
substitute,
as
a
substitute
for
the
ball
amendment
which
would
have
given
a
private
party
the
right
to
independently
go
into
a
district
court
and
get
an
injunction
as
the
substitute
for
that,
senator
taft
proposed
what
is
now
section
303
of
the
act.
and
section
303
of
the
act
permits
an
injured
party
to
go
into
a
court
in
order
to
get
damages.
the
ball
amendment
was
overwhelmingly
defeated
by
a
vote
of
something
like
62
to
28
and
section
10
(l)
of
course
was
retained
in
its
present
form.
and
senator
taft
after
the
conference
committee
had
approved
section
10
(l)
and
section
303
provision
of
the
statute
explained
that
compromise
senator
taft
said
that
under
that
compro
--
under
his
proposal,
the
compromise
which
had
been
accepted,
the
injured
party
was
given
“simply
a
right
of
suit
for
damages”
caused
by
secondary
boycotts
or
jurisdiction
disputes
but
that
in
such
cases,
again
i
want
to
quote,
“the
injunction
can
be
obtained
only
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
think
what
emerges
from
this
legislative
history
is
that
congress
agreed
to
a
narrow
exceptions
of
norris-la-guardia
which
vested
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
board
or
the
regional
director,
i
used
the
terms
interchangeably,
which
vested
exclusively
control
in
the
board
over
the
--
not
only
the
initiation
but
the
control
of
the
litigation
at
all
stages.
the
private
party,
the
injured
party
was
given
simply
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
and
in
section
10
(l),
in
section
10
(l),
congress
assigned
a
subordinate
role
to
the
charging
party
of
merely
aiding
and
assisting
in
the
conduct
of
the
10
(l)
proceedings
by
the
regional
director,
but
it
was
the
regional
director
who
remained
in
control
and
as
i
said
earlier,
the
fight
between
the
proponents
of
the
ball
amendment
and
the
--
and
those
who
opposed
it
was
not
simply
a
fight
where
who
is
going
to
have
control
over
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings,
the
fight
went
much
deeper.
the
fight
was
who
would
be
in
control
of
that
kind
of
litigation,
the
injured
party
or
the
board?
and
congress
answered
that
question
firmly
in
favor
of
the
board
and
i
believe
that
its
action
indicates
that
congress
withheld
from
the
charging
party
the
status
of
a
--
of
a
party,
the
status
of
a
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
status
of
a
party
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
--
that
may
well
be,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it
answers
it
when
you
take
into
account
what
it
was.
what
it
was
that
the
--
what
i'll
call
the
proponents
of
section
(l),
sought
to
accomplish
when
they
adopted
section
10
(l)
and
opposed,
and
opposed
the
ball
amendment.
they
were
fearful,
they
were
fearful
to
give
the
charging
party
any
kind
of
an
independent
right,
independent
right
to
press
for
and
to
seek
an
injunction
or
to
press
for
injunction
and
as
i
said
earlier,
if
the
regional
director
concludes
after
he
has
carried
out
the
mandated
duty
of
going
into
a
district
court,
that
in
the
face
of
that
adverse
decision
and
because
of
other
considerations
i'll
spell
out
in
a
moment,
he
concludes
that
it's
no
longer
appropriate
to
seek
injunctive
or
to
press
for
injunctive
relief
then
the
charging
party
has
taken
charge
of
that
litigation
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
kind
of
control
that
congress
was
talking
about
would
have
--
would
exclude,
would
exclude
the
charging
party
from
going
on
upstairs
and
seeking
to
press
for
an
injunctive
relief.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
already
your
honor.
in
the
senate
bill,
that
is
in
the
bill
reported
by
the
senate
committee,
yes
that
was
already
in
there.
that
was
already
in
there.
as
matter
of
fact,
i
might
add
that
the
--
that
the
house
had
passed
the
bill
which
permitted
both
the
government
or
the
private
party
to
seek
injunctive
relief
but
that
felt
by
the
way
sad
because
eventually
the
conference
committee
agreed,
agreed
with
the
senate
that
section
10
(l)
would
be
adopted.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
must
confess,
i'm
a
little
bit
taken
by
surprise
by
your
question
that
we
were,
that
we
appealed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
read
from
the
retail
clerks.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
retail
clerks
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
director
and
various
locals
of
the
retail
clerks.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh!
i'm
sorry.[laughter]
this
is
an
appeal
--
i
didn't
need
to
hide
it.[laughter]
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
regional
director
of
the
board
and
various
local
of
the
retail
clerks
from
district
court
order
granting
a
temporary
injunction
pursuant
to
petition
by
the
regional
director.
now,
on
page
528,
528
says,
“the
appellants
petition
to
this
court
for
a
stay
of
the
injunction”
and
i
take
it
the
appellants
must
admit
both
us
and
the
retail
clerks.
this
petition
was
denied
but
he
granted
an
expedited
hearing.
by
the
same
order,
this
court
denied
the
charging
parties
in
the
board
proceedings
permission
to
intervene
as
appellees
but
granted
them
permission
to
appear
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
caption
is
appellants,
retail
clerks
the
appellants,
and
ralph
e.
kennedy,
regional
director
--
the
appellant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
says
appellant
here
on
the
--
at
the
top
of
the,
top
of
the
case.
it
says,
retail
clerks,
locals
--
various
sort
of
locals,
appellants
and
ralph
kennedy,
regional
director
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
labor
board,
appellant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
versus
--
excuse
me,
versus
food
employers
council,
appellee.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
food
employers
council,
yes,
that
was
charging
party,
that
was
appellee.
and
the
court
says
with
respect
to
the
answers
by
the
same
order
this
court
denied
the
charging
parties
in
the
board
proceedings
permission
to
intervene
as
appellees
but
granted
them
permission
to
appear
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
that
is
our
argument
and
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
in
account
of
retail
clerks,
i
will
call
attention
once
more
to
the
henderson
case
which
a
court
just
decided
within
the
last
few
months
and
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
where
they
line
up
--
where
they
line
up
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
on
the
right
to
appeal,
but
i
think
those
are
the
underlying
considerations
really
as
to
why
they
don't
have
the
right
to
appeal.
well,
i
did
promise
at
the
beginning
though
i
haven't
covered
all
the
considerations
but
i
think
i
made
the
clear,
the
heart
of
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
power
to
appeal.
i
did
indicate
earlier
that
i
would
say
something
about
the
mootness
question
and
before
i
sit
down,
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
question.
i
see
my
light
is
flashing
and
i
don't
want
to
deprive
my
brother
of
any
time
unless
the
court
is
willing
to
give
me
a
few
more
minutes,
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
my
red
light,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
i
have
a
few
more
minutes,
so
i
can
talk
about
the
mootness?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alright,
sir.
thank
you.
the
statute
provides
that
a
district
court
may
grant
such
injunctive
relief
as
it
deems
just
in
proper
pending
the
board's
final
adjudication
with
respect
to
the
matter
whether
or
not
this
case
is
moot
depends
upon
what
do
we
mean
by
pending
final
adjudication
by
the
board,
by
or
the
matter
by
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
do
--
what
does
that
phrase
mean?
that
the
district
court
has
the
authority
to
grant
interlocutory
injunctive
relief
pending
at
the
final
adjudication
of
the
matter
by
the
board.
the
board
has
issued
its
decision
and
final
order
in
this
case
and
we
say
that
that
final
--
that
decision
and
final
order
of
the
board
is
the
final
adjudication
of
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
section
10
(l)
and
with
the
issuance
of
the
--
and
with
the
issuance
of
the
board's
decision
which
as
i
say,
constitutes
this
final
adjudication
the
power
of
the
district
court,
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
grant
any
kind
of
injunctive
relief
in
this
case
is
that
an
end.
now,
the
union
has
in
fact,
the
union
has
in
fact
stopped
the
picketing.
as
i
said,
the
board's
decision
and
order
is
presently
pending
on
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
union
should
resume,
if
the
union
should
resume
its
picketing
in
defiance
of
the
board's
order,
the
board
is
empowered
under
section
10
(e)
and
(f)
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
for
such
temporary
relief
as
maybe
appropriate
in
the
circumstances.
it's
not
mandated,
but
it's
empowered
to
do
so
and
presumably
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
board's
order
in
this
case,
it
assured
that
the
board
should
proceed
very
long
in
seeking
to
get
some
kind
of
temporary
injunctive
relief
from
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
argument
that's
being
made
in
this
case
here
that
final
adjudication
by
the
board
and
i'll
be
through
in
just
a
few
minutes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
argument
that's
being
made
in
this
case
here
that
final
adjudication
by
the
board
does
not
mean
--
the
decision
of
the
board
in
this
particular
case
but
that
the
case
is
not
finally
adjudicated
until
it's
run
its
entire
course
before
the
board
as
well
as
the
courts
and
i
may
briefly
ask
by
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
say
final
adjudication
by
the
reviewing
court,
it
says
final
adjudication
by
the
board.
we
think
the
case
is
moot
and
i
may
say
that
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
our
mootness
question
and
having
come
to
this
--
coming
this
far
because
well,
i
think
that
our
argument
on
the
mootness
is
very
strong,
at
the
same
time
i
would
like
to
have
an
answer
from
the
court
as
to
the
standing
of
the
charging
party
in
these
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
either
way,
your
honor,
either
way,[laughter]
