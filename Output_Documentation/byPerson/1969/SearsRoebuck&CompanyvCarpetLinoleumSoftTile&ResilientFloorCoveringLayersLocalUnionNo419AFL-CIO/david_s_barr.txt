mr.
david
s.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
food
employers
council
case
in
so
far
as
its
decision
is
concerned
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take
in
this
case.
the
decision
was
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
regional
director
might
have
preferred
a
settlement
and
thereby
a
dismissal
of
the
petition,
he
could
not
tie
the
hands
of
the
district
court
in
so
far
as
the
discretion
of
that
court
is
concerned
in
fashioning
the
remedy.
that
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take.
the
dictum
in
food
employers
council
is
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take
and
the
dictum
was
eliminated
for
all
intents
and
purposes
in
the
henderson
case
which
mr.
manoli
referred
to
where
they
denied
the
right
to
intervene.
the
statute
if
it
please
the
court
is
not
silent
on
the
question
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
and
in
fact,
the
language
includes
more
than
just
the
rights
of
the
charging
party
but
the
role
of
all
other
persons
involved
in
the
charge.
it
says,
upon
the
filing
of
any
such
petition,
the
court
shall
cause
notice
thereof
to
be
served
upon
any
person
involved
in
the
charge,
and
such
person
including
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony.
that
means
that
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
not
only
the
appeal
rights,
the
independent
appeal
rights
of
the
charging
party.
but
we're
also
talking
about
the
independent
appeal
rights
of
all
the
primary
and
secondary
employers
in
every
secondary
boycott
case.
for
example,
in
this
case,
joe
and
eddie's
carpet
service,
if
sears
is
allowed
to
appeal,
it
would
also
be
allowed
to
independently
appeal.
and
so
would
under
this
language
every
other
primary
and
secondary
employer
involved
under
section
10
(l)
because
of
its
language.
so,
it's
important
to
realize
that
we're
talking
here
about
more
than
just
a
charging
party's
role;
we're
talking
about
these
other
persons'
roles
as
well.
the
language
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony
is
language
of
limitation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'm
talking
precisely
mr.
chief
justice,
about
standing
to
appeal,
standing
to
appeal
when
the
regional
director
refuses
to
do
so.
if
the
language
--
if
the
language
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony
gives
the
right
of
appeal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no,
the
statute,
i
admit,
does
not
say
precisely
there
shall
be
no
right
of
appeal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
but
it
is
less
than
--
it
is
less
than
language
which
would
have
given
them
party
status.
congress
did
not
say
that
charging
parties
shall
be
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation
even
though
in
that
very
same
section,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
in
the
third
proviso,
the
labor
organization
in
the
10
(l)
is
expressly
referred
to
as
a
party
litigant.
mr.
david
s.
barr
now,
that
same
language
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
unfortunately,
the
decision
that
was
read
this
morning
has
not
been
read
by
me
and
so
i
cannot
compare,
i
cannot
compare
the
facts
in
that
case
to
this
one
but
i
would
like
to
say.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
that
quite
apart
from
what
may
be
said
in
those
decisions,
i
don't
know
if
you
had
in
those
decisions
the
limiting
language
that
you
have
here
with
regard
to
simply
the
right
to
present
a
relevant
testimony
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
a
relevant
testimony
when
viewed
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
word
party
and
knew
how
to
use
it
not
only
in
this
same
section
but
in
sections
10
(c)
and
(e)
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
statutory
scheme
whereby
the
board
only
empowered
to
seek
injunctions
under
section
10
(l),
to
institute
injunctive
proceedings
under
10
(j),
to
seek
interim
relief
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
10
(e)
and
(f)
and
even
under
10
(f),
mr.
chief
justice
where
the
aggrieved
party
is
the
party
that
appeals,
the
interim
relief
can
be
afforded
to
the
board
and
not
to
the
party
that
appeals.
so
that,
not
only
the
language
but
the
statutory
scheme
is
evidence,
is
evidence
that
congress
intended
those
words
to
limit
the
role
of
a
charging
party
as
well
as
the
other
persons
involved
in
the
charge
and
of
course
the
legislative
history
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
absolutely
compelling
because
both
senator
ellender,
strong
supporter
of
s.1126
and
senator
taft,
its
chief
sponsor
had
to
rise
and
make
statements
to
the
effect
that
they
strongly
feared
what
would
happen
if
private
litigants
were
given
access
to
the
injunctive
process.
what
would
happen
to
the
remainder
of
the
legislation?
they
thought,
they'd
lose
it
and
so
they
have
to
give
up
the
notion
that
control
of
the
litigation
could
be
vested
in
the
private
litigants
and
there
was
no
question
in
the
debates
of
the
ball
amendment
that
what
they
were
talking
about
was
not
just
the
right
to
initiate
a
suit
but
as
mr.
manoli
correctly
pointed
out,
the
right
to
control
litigation
and
what
evolved
--
what
evolved
from
the
legislative
process
after
a
lengthy
and
very
emotional
debates
on
this
very
point
not
on
the
point
of
appeal,
but
on
the
point
of
the
role
of
charging
parties
was
essentially
a
compromise
just
as
in
much
of
the
other
labor
legislation
that
we
have
on
the
books.
but
it's
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
that
compromise.
the
compromise
was
not
ambiguous
language
leaving
it
up
to
the
courts
for
interpretation.
the
compromise
was
that
there
would
be
a
section
303
rights
on
the
part
of
employers
to
sue
unions
for
damages
in
the
event
of
secondary
boycotts,
that
the
proponents
of
the
bill
would
also
have
the
benefit
of
a
mandatory
injunction
under
section
10
(l).
it
wasn't
discretionary.
and
incidentally,
unions
don't
have
a
similar
right
to
the
right
given
employers
under
section
303,
unions
don't
have
the
benefit
of
any
mandatory
injunction
as
employers
do
under
section
10
(l)
and
in
return
for
that,
in
return
for
those
protections,
the
proponents
of
the
strong
bill
had
to
give
up
the
notion
that
private
litigants
could
control
section
10
(l)
litigation
and
that
limiting
language
was
fashioned
as
a
part
of
that
compromise.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
prosecutor
state,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
we're
talking
about
the
prosecutorial
functions
of
the
regional
director
of
the
board.
we
submit
that
it
strains
credulity
to
believe
that
the
fight
in
the
congress
was
simply
over
who
initiates
these
proceedings.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
page
27
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
debate
involving
the
ball
amendment
and
it
was
a
colloquy
between
mr.
ball
and
senator
o'daniel
who
supported
his
amendment.
senator
o'daniel
posed
the
hypothetical.
he
said,
under
s.1126,
if
the
representative
of
the
national
labors
relations
board
shall
decide
that
the
proceeding
shall
be
filed.
control
of
the
litigation
is
exclusively
vested
in
the
representative
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
rather
than
in
the
person
who
claims
to
have
been
injured
is
not
that
correct.
mr.
ball
said
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
conceded
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
do
again,
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
specifically
says
charging
parties
shall
not
have
the
right
to
appeal
where
the
regional
director
refuses
to
do
so.
therefore,
the
question
has
to
be
answered
by
looking
at
the
language
of
the
section,
by
looking
at
the
scheme
of
the
statute
and
by
looking
at
expressions
like
these
which
indicate
what
congress
probably
intended
with
regard
to
the
issue
before
this
court
and
this
is
the
exercise
we
are
going
through
right
now.
senator
wherry
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
well,
because
all
of
these
other
statutes
do
not
have
the
norris-la
guardia
flavor
and
background
that
section
--
that
the
enactment
of
section
10
had
each
statute
has
to
be
looked
at
in
light
of
its
own
particular
purposes
as
this
court
has
stated.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
not
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation.
i
deny
that
it
was
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
permitted
to
appear.
yes,
it
was
permitted
to
appear
and
present
relevant
testimony.
mr.
david
s.
barr
we
would
suppose
that
they'd
have
right
to
cross-examine.
i
think
that's
implied
in
the
grant
stated
by
the
language.
mr.
david
s.
barr
pardon
me?
mr.
david
s.
barr
they
are
allowed.
they
are
--
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
word
consistently
is
correct.
i
think
that
usually,
their
role
in
10
(l)
litigation
is
very
limited
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
in
this
case,
they
didn't
engage
in
cross-examination.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes
all
the
cases
that
rule
on
that
issue
have
said
it
cannot
intervene,
every
single
case
that
has
ruled
in
itself.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
think
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
cases
here.
absolutely,
and
in
fact,
some
of
those
very
cases
which
have
denied
the
right
to
intervene
under
section
10
(l)
have
recognized
the
force
of
schofield
but
have
distinguished
it.
and
they've
distinguished
it
on
very
valid
grounds
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
they
pointed
out
in
their
decisions
as
professor
moore
distinguishes
schofield
when
it
comes
to
section
10
(l)
litigation.
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
henderson
distinguished
schofield
when
it
comes
to
10
(l)
litigation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
holding
that
i'm
familiar
with
has
denied
the
right
of
a
charging
party
and
that
reynolds
versus
marlene
industries,
the
union
charging
party
in
the
10
(j)
was
denied
the
right
to
intervene
in
that
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
believe
he
does
and
i
believe
he
should.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes,
and
i
really
have
no
explanation
for
that.
it
might
have
been
an
oversight.
it
might
have
been
an
oversight
in
the
process
of
legislating,
i
believe
frankly
that
section
10
(j)
sort
of
came
along
after
everything
else
and
i
don't
think
they
were
as
careful
with
the
language
of
section
10
(j)
as
they
were
with
the
language
of
section
10
(l).
as
i
say,
the
law
is
not
been
completely
developed
under
section
10
(j).
the
only
case
i
know
of
is
this
reynolds
versus
marlene
industry
where
they
denied
the
right
to
intervene
in
a
10
(j)
proceeding.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it's
utilized
very
rarely.
we'd
like
to
see
it
utilized
more
often
but
unfortunately
it's
not.
i
want
to,
before
sitting
down,
make
one
comment
about
mootness.
the
counsel
for
sears
argued
that
this
case
ought
not
to
be
dismissed
as
moot
because
under
the
southern
pacific
terminal
line
of
decisions,
this
court
has
held
that
a
case
ought
not
to
be
dismissed
as
moot
where
it
otherwise
--
where
otherwise
the
issue
could
never
reach
this
court.
there
are
two
answers
that
we'd
like
to
present
to
this.
first
of
all,
it
is
very
possible
for
this
same
issue
to
appear
before
this
court
in
the
proper
case
because
many
board
cases
are
very
lengthy.
many
board
cases
go
over
two
years
whether
they
--
whether
it's
because
the
issue
is
complicated
or
because
in
a
10
(k)
case,
for
example,
you
might
have
two
or
three
weeks
of
hearings.
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
many
very
lengthy
board
decisions,
board
cases
and
therefore,
it
is
very
possible
for
this
issue
to
come
here
in
a
proper
case
at
a
later
time.
second
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
board
is
final,
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
issue
on
january
--
on
june
20th.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
appealed.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
appealed
only
because
it
was
final
by
the
way.
under
section
10
(f),
it
could
not
have
been
appealed
if
it
were
not
final.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
decision
is
in
effect.
mr.
david
s.
barr
if
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
the
board,
well
that
ends
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
well,
it's
final
--
it's
a
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
it's
a
final
--
it's
not
a
final
adjudication
of
the
case.
but
the
language
of
section
10
(l)
is
final
adjudication
of
the
board
not
final
adjudication
of
the
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it's
an
appeal
that
we
filed
mr.
justice
stewart
for
review,
for
review.
mr.
david
s.
barr
for
review.
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
board
cross-applied
for
enforcement,
so
that
both
the
petition
for
review
and
the
cross
application
are
before
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
but
i
want
to
say
that
the
second
answer
to
the
mootness
argument
is
that
that
was
not
the
issue
in
southern
pacific
terminal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'll
just
finish
that
sentence.
the
issue
in
those
cases
was
not
whether
the
issue
could
come
before
this
court
at
some
future
time
or
not.
the
issue
was
whether
this
court
ought
to
dismiss
a
case
as
moot
when
the
effect
of
an
order
that
was
issued
by
agency
or
a
court
still
continued
despite
its
technical
expiration.
in
other
words,
there
were
still
an
order
that
was
even
though
technically
expired
was
influencing
and
coercing
the
comment
of
the
parties.
that's
not
this
case
and
this
case
is
moot.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
david
s.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
food
employers
council
case
in
so
far
as
its
decision
is
concerned
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take
in
this
case.
the
decision
was
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
regional
director
might
have
preferred
a
settlement
and
thereby
a
dismissal
of
the
petition,
he
could
not
tie
the
hands
of
the
district
court
in
so
far
as
the
discretion
of
that
court
is
concerned
in
fashioning
the
remedy.
that
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take.
the
dictum
in
food
employers
council
is
in
conflict
with
the
position
we
take
and
the
dictum
was
eliminated
for
all
intents
and
purposes
in
the
henderson
case
which
mr.
manoli
referred
to
where
they
denied
the
right
to
intervene.
the
statute
if
it
please
the
court
is
not
silent
on
the
question
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
and
in
fact,
the
language
includes
more
than
just
the
rights
of
the
charging
party
but
the
role
of
all
other
persons
involved
in
the
charge.
it
says,
upon
the
filing
of
any
such
petition,
the
court
shall
cause
notice
thereof
to
be
served
upon
any
person
involved
in
the
charge,
and
such
person
including
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony.
that
means
that
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
not
only
the
appeal
rights,
the
independent
appeal
rights
of
the
charging
party.
but
we're
also
talking
about
the
independent
appeal
rights
of
all
the
primary
and
secondary
employers
in
every
secondary
boycott
case.
for
example,
in
this
case,
joe
and
eddie's
carpet
service,
if
sears
is
allowed
to
appeal,
it
would
also
be
allowed
to
independently
appeal.
and
so
would
under
this
language
every
other
primary
and
secondary
employer
involved
under
section
10
(l)
because
of
its
language.
so,
it's
important
to
realize
that
we're
talking
here
about
more
than
just
a
charging
party's
role;
we're
talking
about
these
other
persons'
roles
as
well.
the
language
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony
is
language
of
limitation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'm
talking
precisely
mr.
chief
justice,
about
standing
to
appeal,
standing
to
appeal
when
the
regional
director
refuses
to
do
so.
if
the
language
--
if
the
language
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony
gives
the
right
of
appeal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no,
the
statute,
i
admit,
does
not
say
precisely
there
shall
be
no
right
of
appeal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
but
it
is
less
than
--
it
is
less
than
language
which
would
have
given
them
party
status.
congress
did
not
say
that
charging
parties
shall
be
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation
even
though
in
that
very
same
section,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
in
the
third
proviso,
the
labor
organization
in
the
10
(l)
is
expressly
referred
to
as
a
party
litigant.
mr.
david
s.
barr
now,
that
same
language
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
unfortunately,
the
decision
that
was
read
this
morning
has
not
been
read
by
me
and
so
i
cannot
compare,
i
cannot
compare
the
facts
in
that
case
to
this
one
but
i
would
like
to
say.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'm
very
sorry
about
that.
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
that
quite
apart
from
what
may
be
said
in
those
decisions,
i
don't
know
if
you
had
in
those
decisions
the
limiting
language
that
you
have
here
with
regard
to
simply
the
right
to
present
a
relevant
testimony
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
a
relevant
testimony
when
viewed
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
word
party
and
knew
how
to
use
it
not
only
in
this
same
section
but
in
sections
10
(c)
and
(e)
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
statutory
scheme
whereby
the
board
only
empowered
to
seek
injunctions
under
section
10
(l),
to
institute
injunctive
proceedings
under
10
(j),
to
seek
interim
relief
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
10
(e)
and
(f)
and
even
under
10
(f),
mr.
chief
justice
where
the
aggrieved
party
is
the
party
that
appeals,
the
interim
relief
can
be
afforded
to
the
board
and
not
to
the
party
that
appeals.
so
that,
not
only
the
language
but
the
statutory
scheme
is
evidence,
is
evidence
that
congress
intended
those
words
to
limit
the
role
of
a
charging
party
as
well
as
the
other
persons
involved
in
the
charge
and
of
course
the
legislative
history
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
absolutely
compelling
because
both
senator
ellender,
strong
supporter
of
s.1126
and
senator
taft,
its
chief
sponsor
had
to
rise
and
make
statements
to
the
effect
that
they
strongly
feared
what
would
happen
if
private
litigants
were
given
access
to
the
injunctive
process.
what
would
happen
to
the
remainder
of
the
legislation?
they
thought,
they'd
lose
it
and
so
they
have
to
give
up
the
notion
that
control
of
the
litigation
could
be
vested
in
the
private
litigants
and
there
was
no
question
in
the
debates
of
the
ball
amendment
that
what
they
were
talking
about
was
not
just
the
right
to
initiate
a
suit
but
as
mr.
manoli
correctly
pointed
out,
the
right
to
control
litigation
and
what
evolved
--
what
evolved
from
the
legislative
process
after
a
lengthy
and
very
emotional
debates
on
this
very
point
not
on
the
point
of
appeal,
but
on
the
point
of
the
role
of
charging
parties
was
essentially
a
compromise
just
as
in
much
of
the
other
labor
legislation
that
we
have
on
the
books.
but
it's
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
that
compromise.
the
compromise
was
not
ambiguous
language
leaving
it
up
to
the
courts
for
interpretation.
the
compromise
was
that
there
would
be
a
section
303
rights
on
the
part
of
employers
to
sue
unions
for
damages
in
the
event
of
secondary
boycotts,
that
the
proponents
of
the
bill
would
also
have
the
benefit
of
a
mandatory
injunction
under
section
10
(l).
it
wasn't
discretionary.
and
incidentally,
unions
don't
have
a
similar
right
to
the
right
given
employers
under
section
303,
unions
don't
have
the
benefit
of
any
mandatory
injunction
as
employers
do
under
section
10
(l)
and
in
return
for
that,
in
return
for
those
protections,
the
proponents
of
the
strong
bill
had
to
give
up
the
notion
that
private
litigants
could
control
section
10
(l)
litigation
and
that
limiting
language
was
fashioned
as
a
part
of
that
compromise.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
prosecutor
state,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
we're
talking
about
the
prosecutorial
functions
of
the
regional
director
of
the
board.
we
submit
that
it
strains
credulity
to
believe
that
the
fight
in
the
congress
was
simply
over
who
initiates
these
proceedings.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes.
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
page
27
of
our
brief,
this
is
the
debate
involving
the
ball
amendment
and
it
was
a
colloquy
between
mr.
ball
and
senator
o'daniel
who
supported
his
amendment.
senator
o'daniel
posed
the
hypothetical.
he
said,
under
s.1126,
if
the
representative
of
the
national
labors
relations
board
shall
decide
that
the
proceeding
shall
be
filed.
control
of
the
litigation
is
exclusively
vested
in
the
representative
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
rather
than
in
the
person
who
claims
to
have
been
injured
is
not
that
correct.
mr.
ball
said
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
conceded
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
do
again,
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
specifically
says
charging
parties
shall
not
have
the
right
to
appeal
where
the
regional
director
refuses
to
do
so.
therefore,
the
question
has
to
be
answered
by
looking
at
the
language
of
the
section,
by
looking
at
the
scheme
of
the
statute
and
by
looking
at
expressions
like
these
which
indicate
what
congress
probably
intended
with
regard
to
the
issue
before
this
court
and
this
is
the
exercise
we
are
going
through
right
now.
senator
wherry
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
well,
because
all
of
these
other
statutes
do
not
have
the
norris-la
guardia
flavor
and
background
that
section
--
that
the
enactment
of
section
10
had
each
statute
has
to
be
looked
at
in
light
of
its
own
particular
purposes
as
this
court
has
stated.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
not
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation.
i
deny
that
it
was
a
party
in
the
10
(l)
litigation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
permitted
to
appear.
yes,
it
was
permitted
to
appear
and
present
relevant
testimony.
mr.
david
s.
barr
we
would
suppose
that
they'd
have
right
to
cross-examine.
i
think
that's
implied
in
the
grant
stated
by
the
language.
mr.
david
s.
barr
pardon
me?
mr.
david
s.
barr
they
are
allowed.
they
are
--
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
word
consistently
is
correct.
i
think
that
usually,
their
role
in
10
(l)
litigation
is
very
limited
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
in
this
case,
they
didn't
engage
in
cross-examination.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
no.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes
all
the
cases
that
rule
on
that
issue
have
said
it
cannot
intervene,
every
single
case
that
has
ruled
in
itself.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
think
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
cases
here.
absolutely,
and
in
fact,
some
of
those
very
cases
which
have
denied
the
right
to
intervene
under
section
10
(l)
have
recognized
the
force
of
schofield
but
have
distinguished
it.
and
they've
distinguished
it
on
very
valid
grounds
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
they
pointed
out
in
their
decisions
as
professor
moore
distinguishes
schofield
when
it
comes
to
section
10
(l)
litigation.
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
henderson
distinguished
schofield
when
it
comes
to
10
(l)
litigation.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
holding
that
i'm
familiar
with
has
denied
the
right
of
a
charging
party
and
that
reynolds
versus
marlene
industries,
the
union
charging
party
in
the
10
(j)
was
denied
the
right
to
intervene
in
that
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i
believe
he
does
and
i
believe
he
should.
mr.
david
s.
barr
yes,
and
i
really
have
no
explanation
for
that.
it
might
have
been
an
oversight.
it
might
have
been
an
oversight
in
the
process
of
legislating,
i
believe
frankly
that
section
10
(j)
sort
of
came
along
after
everything
else
and
i
don't
think
they
were
as
careful
with
the
language
of
section
10
(j)
as
they
were
with
the
language
of
section
10
(l).
as
i
say,
the
law
is
not
been
completely
developed
under
section
10
(j).
the
only
case
i
know
of
is
this
reynolds
versus
marlene
industry
where
they
denied
the
right
to
intervene
in
a
10
(j)
proceeding.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it's
utilized
very
rarely.
we'd
like
to
see
it
utilized
more
often
but
unfortunately
it's
not.
i
want
to,
before
sitting
down,
make
one
comment
about
mootness.
the
counsel
for
sears
argued
that
this
case
ought
not
to
be
dismissed
as
moot
because
under
the
southern
pacific
terminal
line
of
decisions,
this
court
has
held
that
a
case
ought
not
to
be
dismissed
as
moot
where
it
otherwise
--
where
otherwise
the
issue
could
never
reach
this
court.
there
are
two
answers
that
we'd
like
to
present
to
this.
first
of
all,
it
is
very
possible
for
this
same
issue
to
appear
before
this
court
in
the
proper
case
because
many
board
cases
are
very
lengthy.
many
board
cases
go
over
two
years
whether
they
--
whether
it's
because
the
issue
is
complicated
or
because
in
a
10
(k)
case,
for
example,
you
might
have
two
or
three
weeks
of
hearings.
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
many
very
lengthy
board
decisions,
board
cases
and
therefore,
it
is
very
possible
for
this
issue
to
come
here
in
a
proper
case
at
a
later
time.
second
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
board
is
final,
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
issue
on
january
--
on
june
20th.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
appealed.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it
was
appealed
only
because
it
was
final
by
the
way.
under
section
10
(f),
it
could
not
have
been
appealed
if
it
were
not
final.
mr.
david
s.
barr
the
decision
is
in
effect.
mr.
david
s.
barr
if
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
the
board,
well
that
ends
--
mr.
david
s.
barr
well,
it's
final
--
it's
a
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
it's
a
final
--
it's
not
a
final
adjudication
of
the
case.
but
the
language
of
section
10
(l)
is
final
adjudication
of
the
board
not
final
adjudication
of
the
case.
mr.
david
s.
barr
it's
an
appeal
that
we
filed
mr.
justice
stewart
for
review,
for
review.
mr.
david
s.
barr
for
review.
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
board
cross-applied
for
enforcement,
so
that
both
the
petition
for
review
and
the
cross
application
are
before
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
but
i
want
to
say
that
the
second
answer
to
the
mootness
argument
is
that
that
was
not
the
issue
in
southern
pacific
terminal.
mr.
david
s.
barr
i'll
just
finish
that
sentence.
the
issue
in
those
cases
was
not
whether
the
issue
could
come
before
this
court
at
some
future
time
or
not.
the
issue
was
whether
this
court
ought
to
dismiss
a
case
as
moot
when
the
effect
of
an
order
that
was
issued
by
agency
or
a
court
still
continued
despite
its
technical
expiration.
in
other
words,
there
were
still
an
order
that
was
even
though
technically
expired
was
influencing
and
coercing
the
comment
of
the
parties.
that's
not
this
case
and
this
case
is
moot.
thank
you
very
much.
