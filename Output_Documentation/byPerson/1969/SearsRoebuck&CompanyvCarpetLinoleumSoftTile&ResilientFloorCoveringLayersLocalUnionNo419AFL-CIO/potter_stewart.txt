justice
potter
stewart
whether
both
cases
are
still
very
much
alive
is
one
of
the
questions
at
issue
between
you
and
your
brothers,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
controverted
question
of
mootness
in
this
case
that
you
are
arguing,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
act
of
1947.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
on
the
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
general
electric
case,
what
did
the
court
hold?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
10
(j)
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
in
this
ninth
circuit
case,
retail
clerks
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
appears
that
the
regional
office
initiated
proceedings
for
an
injunction
under
10
(j)?
justice
potter
stewart
10
(l),
i
beg
your
pardon.
then
reached
some
sort
of
a
compromised
agreement
with
the
union.
the
court
--
district
court
nevertheless
went
on
at
the
behest
of
the
charging
party
and
granted
the
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
the
regional
director
then
appealed,
although
he'd
been
the
regional
plaintiff,
he
appealed
from
a
decision
which
had
gone
in
his
favor
as
a
regional
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
the
relief
he'd
originally
asked
for
and
the
appellee
in
that
case
was
the
charging
party,
is
that
right?
how
the
appellee
get
in
the
case
as
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
appellee
is
the
food
employers
council,
incorporated
and
i
assume
that's
the
charging
party.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
i'm
asking
about
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
specific
question,
how
the
appellee,
the
appellee
was
a
charging
party
here
and
therefore,
was
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
gather,
but
as
an
appellee
and
not
an
appellant.
justice
potter
stewart
that
board
itself
apparently
made
him
an
appellee.
justice
potter
stewart
and
assume
--
i
assume
the
council
was
the
charging
party?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
board,
the
regional
director
of
the
board
by
then
when
it
took
its
appeal
may
charging
party,
a
party
to
the
litigation
in
the
court
of
appeals,
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
not
the
way
judge
barnes
opinion
begins,
the
very
first
sentence.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
regional
director
of
the
nlrb
and
various
locals
of
the
retail
clerks
from
a
district
court
order
granted
a
temporary
injunction
pursuant
to
a
petition
by
the
regional
director,
and
so
on.
so
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
argument
go
mr.
manoli?
now,
congress
--
what
congress
did
provide
in
10
(l)
was
that
if
the
regional
council
thought
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
unfair
labor
charge
was
correct,
it
had
an
absolute
duty
to
file,
to
go
to
a
--
first
of
all
had
a
duty
to
give
priority
to
this
kind
of
a
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
having
given
priority
and
then
making
a
--
having
finding
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
he
choose
to
charge
and
had
an
absolute
duty
to
go
to
a
federal
district
court
and
file
a
petition
for
an
injunction,
and
you
say
i
suppose
in
your
argument
that
10
minutes
later
it
could
say,
“well,
we
want
now
to
dismiss
the
injunction.”
that
would
hardly
concord
with
the
obvious
will
of
congress,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mandated
by
statute,
the
congress
stands.
justice
potter
stewart
seek
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
all
the
congress
required
was
that
he
file
the
petition
and
that
10
minutes
later,
he
could
say,
i
now
want
to
dismiss
it?
he
was
prejudiced.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
comports
with
what
the
congress
said
in
10
(l)?
justice
potter
stewart
couldn't
have
been
much
for
a
preliminary
investigation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
thrust
of
your
argument
now
is
quite
in
conflict
with
was
decided
in
the
retail
clerks
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
broad
thrust
of
your
present
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
i
say
that
i'm
not
now
talking
about
the
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
read
the
very
first
sentence
of
judge
barnes'
opinion,
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart
the
very
first
sentence
of
judge
barnes.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
potter
stewart
but
look
at
the
caption
of
the
case,
who's
the
respon
--
who's
the
appellee?
as
i
say,
i
don't
have
in
front
of
me
but
i
think
my
memory
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
appellee.
no,
i
say,
who's
the
appellee?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
have
any
appellee
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
appellee,
that's
the
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wasn't
--
we
can
close
look
at
those
books
but
i
--
my
question
wasn't
directed
to
that
at
all.
it
was
directed
to
--
if
i
understand
the
basic
thrust
of
your
present
argument,
i.e.
that
the
regional
director
of
the
board
is
given
absolute
control
of
the
litigation
from
first
to
last
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
quite
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
retail
clerks
case,
am
i
mistaken
in
my
understanding
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
on
the
appealability,
on
the
right
to
appeal.
i'm
talking
about
the
right
to
control.
justice
potter
stewart
i've
ask
to
--
i've
taken
up
a
lot
of
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
a
right
to
support
the
position.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
--
i'm
just
looking
at
it
in
the
appendix,
in
10
(l)
as
you
well
know
it's
spelled
out
at
least,
part
of
it
is
spelled
out
that
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony
as
in
the
text
of
10
(l).
it
does
not
seem
to
be
an
equivalent
provision
or
sentence
in
10
(j).
justice
potter
stewart
10
(j)
is
not
very
often
utilized,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
an
appeal
or
is
it
a
petition
for
enforcement
of
the
board's
adjudication?
justice
potter
stewart
for
review.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
both
cases
are
still
very
much
alive
is
one
of
the
questions
at
issue
between
you
and
your
brothers,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
controverted
question
of
mootness
in
this
case
that
you
are
arguing,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
act
of
1947.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
on
the
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
general
electric
case,
what
did
the
court
hold?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
10
(j)
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
in
this
ninth
circuit
case,
retail
clerks
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
appears
that
the
regional
office
initiated
proceedings
for
an
injunction
under
10
(j)?
justice
potter
stewart
10
(l),
i
beg
your
pardon.
then
reached
some
sort
of
a
compromised
agreement
with
the
union.
the
court
--
district
court
nevertheless
went
on
at
the
behest
of
the
charging
party
and
granted
the
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
the
regional
director
then
appealed,
although
he'd
been
the
regional
plaintiff,
he
appealed
from
a
decision
which
had
gone
in
his
favor
as
a
regional
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
the
relief
he'd
originally
asked
for
and
the
appellee
in
that
case
was
the
charging
party,
is
that
right?
how
the
appellee
get
in
the
case
as
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
appellee
is
the
food
employers
council,
incorporated
and
i
assume
that's
the
charging
party.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
i'm
asking
about
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
specific
question,
how
the
appellee,
the
appellee
was
a
charging
party
here
and
therefore,
was
a
party
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
gather,
but
as
an
appellee
and
not
an
appellant.
justice
potter
stewart
that
board
itself
apparently
made
him
an
appellee.
justice
potter
stewart
and
assume
--
i
assume
the
council
was
the
charging
party?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
board,
the
regional
director
of
the
board
by
then
when
it
took
its
appeal
may
charging
party,
a
party
to
the
litigation
in
the
court
of
appeals,
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
not
the
way
judge
barnes
opinion
begins,
the
very
first
sentence.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
regional
director
of
the
nlrb
and
various
locals
of
the
retail
clerks
from
a
district
court
order
granted
a
temporary
injunction
pursuant
to
a
petition
by
the
regional
director,
and
so
on.
so
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
argument
go
mr.
manoli?
now,
congress
--
what
congress
did
provide
in

that

and
you

in
your

that
10
