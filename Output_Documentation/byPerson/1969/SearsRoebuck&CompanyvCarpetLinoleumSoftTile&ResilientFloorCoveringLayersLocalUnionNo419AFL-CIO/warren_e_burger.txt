smetana,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're

chief

i
think
your
friend
is
going
to
mention
it.

we'll

for
lunch
mr.

[lunch

you
may
continue
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
clarity
of
the
statute
on
that
point
helps
persuade
you
there,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
not
clear
you
will
contend
on
the
appellate
--
on
the
right
of
the
standing
to
take
an
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
manoli.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
are
you
--
were
they
addressing
themselves
to
the
initiation
at
this
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
do
you
suggest
that
the
grantor
standing
to
the
employer
at
the
appellate
stage
for
review
only
would
take
control
of
the
case
away
from
the
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
that
had
been
true
if
the
board
drops
out,
the
board
refuses
to
go
ahead
and
i
could
understand
your
argument
that
the
private
party
has
taken
over
but
would
that
not
be
something
of
the
signal
to
the
courts
if
standing
were
granted
to
the
private
party
to
go
ahead
and
the
board
did
not
appear
to
take
part.
it
certainly
wouldn't
strengthen
the
private
party's
case
at
the
appellate
level,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
know
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
keep
emphasizing
control
of
the
litigation
as
though
litigation
were
just
one
indivisible
component.
the
many
instances
where
this
court
and
other
courts
have
grantor
standing
to
seek
review
or
a
standing
in
the
first
instance
or
intervention
was
denied,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
control
of
the
litigation
concept
doesn't
answer
all
the
questions
quite,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
your
red

i
was
reading
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you'd
like
to
have
it
resolve
if
we'll
resolve
at
the
right
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
manoli.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
barr,
all
of
that
argument
is
addressed
to
the
litigation
in
the
first
stage
and
we're
more
or
less
beyond
that,
aren't
we?
we're
talking
about
standing
on
appeal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
standing
for
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
language
that
you
used
when
you're
talking
about
an
appellate
review?
isn't
that
the
language
you
used
when
you're
talking
about
the
first
stages
of
the
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
evidence
to
present
it
in
your
appellate
level.
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
i
want
to
have
you
interrupted
for
a
moment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
had
a
chance
really
to
digest
the
opinions
that
mr.
justice
douglas
read
this
morning
in
connection
with
the
data
processing
case
with
barlow
case
but
i
suspect
you
glanced
over
them.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
that
gave
any
more
aid
and
comfort
to
the
idea
of
the
appellate
review,
really,
and
there
is
here,
would
you
agree
to
that
or
do
you
think
that
might
be
a
little
bit
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.

we
won't
take
advantage
of
you
then.

well,
they
do

of

don't
they?
chief
