mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
determination
of
the
status
of
charging
parties
under
section
10
(l)
of
the
act,
specifically,
whether
they
have
standing
to
appeal
denial
of
temporary
injunctive
relief.
section
10
(l)
of
the
act
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
it
provides
whenever
it
is
charge
that
any
person
has
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
(b)
and
(c),
and
specifically
here
that
charging
party
is
a
neutral
employer
in
a
charge
involving
violations
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
act.
so
the
charging
party
is
one
of
the
person's
contemplated
for
protection
under
section
10
(l).
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
the
preliminary
investigation
of
such
charge
shall
be
made
forthwith
and
be
given
priority
over
all
cases.
in
this
particular
case
sears
roebuck,
the
petitioner
filed
a
charge
with
the
nlrb,
and
the
nlrb
proceeded
to
make
such
investigation.
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
if
after
such
investigation,
the
officer
or
regional
attorney
to
whom
the
matter
may
be
refer
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
such
charge
is
true,
and
that
a
complaint
should
issue,
he
shall
on
behalf
of
the
board,
petition
a
district
court
for
injunctive
relief.
in
this
particular
case,
the
regional
director
for
the
nlrb
in
denver
made
such
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
and
he
follow
the
statutory
mandate
and
sought
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
colorado.
it
is
our
position
that
the
charging
party
or
neutral
--
a
neutral
party
such
as
sears
is
in
this
case
is
the
very
person
whom
congress
when
it
enacted,
not
only
the
8
(b)
(4)
provisions,
the
secondary
boycott
provision
at
the
time
of
taft-hartley,
but
also
section
10
(l),
the
mandatory
requirement
that
the
government
seek
injunctive
relief
is
the
party
for
whose
benefit,
in
addition
of
course
to
the
public
a
benefit,
for
whose
benefit
the
relief
is
being
sought.
specifically,
the
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
justice
harlan,
the
statute
says
only
this
with
respect
to
the
role
of
the
charging
party.
upon
filing
of
any
such
petition,
the
courts
shall
cause
notice
thereof
to
be
served
upon
any
person
involved
in
the
charge.
and
such
person,
including
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
statute
specifically
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
your
honor?
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
it
is
--
the
terms
do
not
explicitly
refer
to
the
charging
party
is
a
party
acceptance
so
far
as
the
word
party
is
used
together
with
charging.
but
it
is
our
contention
and
we
will
demonstrate
to
this
court
as
we
believe
we
have
in
our
briefs
that
in
reading
--
in
looking
to
the
entire
scheme
of
the
act,
in
other
words,
the
role,
the
charging
party's
play
in
the
board
proceeding
because
the
same
charge
which
sears
roebuck
here
filed
gave
rise
to
two
proceedings,
and
gave
rise
to
two
concurrent
actions.
in
fact
it
happens
in
this
case,
they
were
on
the
same
day,
although,
they
need
them
to
bid.
in
this
particular
case,
the
regional
director
issued
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
alleging
that
the
carpet
layers
respondent
union
here
was
violating
or
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
respondent
union
was
violating
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
act,
and
similarly,
filed
a
petition
for
injunctive
relief.
those
two
cases
are
still
very
much
alive.
and
the
regional
director
at
all
times,
critical
to
our
contention
here
has
continued
to
maintain
that
reasonable
belief
or
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
union
has
violated
the
law
or
was
in
the
process
of
violating
the
law.
for
had,
the
regional
director
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
there
is
a
question
if
this
court
would
--
will
wish
to
hear
argument
on
that
question.
i
certainly
would
toward
the
end
of
my
argument.
i'll
be
happy
to
present
our
contentions
on
mootness.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes,
i'm
sure
he
is.
well,
essentially
on
the
mootness
question,
very
briefly,
the
major
position
that
we
would
take
with
respect
to
mootness
is
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
issues
involved
--
that
the
orders
involved
here
are
short-term
orders.
specifically,
injunctive
relief
under
section
10
(l)
of
the
act
is
the
kind
of
relief
that
normally
expires
because
the
dispute
is
resolved.
and
so
that
if
there
are
some
problem
with
respect
to
the
correctness
of
the
standing
of
parties
in
that
proceeding,
this
court
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
resolve
that
question
if
it
were
to
wait
--
if
it
could
not
do
so
at
that
time.
and
so
under
the
doctrine
of
the
southern
pacific
terminal
case
and
more
recently
as
this
court
said
last
year
in
the
moore
versus
ogilvie,
these
are
important
public
questions
that
will
come
up
again,
and
that
should
--
that
are
not
rendered
moot
because
of
the
continuing
effect
not
only
upon
sears
in
this
case
and
another
cases,
but
other
parties
similarly
situated
and
would
escape
review
but
for
the
mootness
doctrine.
therefore,
the
mootness
doctrine
would
be
set
aside.
we
also
contend
that
the
case
is
not
factually
moot.
we
say
it
is
not
factually
moot
because
for
a
number
of
reasons.
specifically
that
as
in
the
--
as
in
bakery
drivers
versus
wagshal,
the
union
here
to
the
extent
that
it
has
stop
picketing
what
whatever
we
can
infer
from
that,
we
can
only
infer
that
it
did
stop
picketing
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
board.
and
more
specifically,
the
union
maintains
the
correctness
of
its
position
and
has
so
argued
that
correctness
of
its
position,
january
22nd
this
year
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
maintaining
that
it
believes
and
continues
to
believe
that
the
picketing
of
sears
roebuck
was
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
so
that
so
long
as
this
controversy
and
the
underlying
dispute
remains,
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
the
picketing
will
resume,
and
that
possibility
would
come
about,
should
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
where
the
--
and
what
happened
here
in
the
underlying
cases
that
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
found
the
union
to
have
violated
section
8
(b)
(4).
the
union
moved
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
that
decision
and
the
sears
roebuck
intervened
and
the
board
cross
petition
for
enforcement
of
that
decision.
and
in
the
event,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
remands
to
the
board
there
are
number
of
possibilities
as
to
what
can
arise
in
that
case.
should
there
be
a
remand,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
also
then
the
possibility
of
a
renewal
of
picketing
because
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
something
further
the
board
might
have
to
do.
in
any
event,
so
far
as
the
factual
mootness,
it
is
our
further
contention
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
so
far
as
the
time
during
which
the
injunctive
provision
runs.
in
other
words,
in
section
10
(l),
section
10
(l)
states
that
the
injunction
--
that
the
court
shall
grant
such
injunctive
relief
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
so,
there
is
another
question
although
it
is
perhaps
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
resolve
that
question.
if
it
resolves
the
question
of
mootness
on
the
southern
pacific
terminal
and
moore
versus
ogilvie
line
of
cases,
it
is
perhaps
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
interpretation
of
those
words
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
but
it
is
our
position
that
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board
means
when
the
matter
has
finally
been
resolved
by
the
board
and
that
a
settlement
will
be
a
final
resolution.
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
it
has
not
been
finally
been
resolved
by
the
board
because
of
the
possibility
of
the
remand,
because
in
that
situation,
the
board
would
have
to
do
the
something
further,
and
we
recognized
the
fact
that
there
is
a
final
board
order
here
from
which
the
union
appeals
the
statutory
language
is
not
clear,
but
we
would
contend
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
final
adjudication.
we
have
no
authority
other
than
logic
and
reason
to
support
that
position.
our
argument
--
before
i
pass
on
to
the
argument,
i
should
briefly
summarize
any
facts
that
i
have
in
my
opening
remarks
not
alluded
to.
in
this
particular
case,
the
picketing
and
the
picketing
of
sears
roebuck
continued
for
a
period
of
10
months.
there
was
--
the
argument
your
honor
essentially
falls
into
two
or
three
categories.
our
major
contention
is
that
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
this
court
has
consider
the
scheme
of
the
act
in
its
scofield
decision
renders
that
charging
parties
should
have
the
right
to
appeal.
the
reason
for
--
specifically,
what
we
would
urge
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
charging
parties
possess
the
very
rights
that
are
set
forth
in
section
10
(l).
they
possess
those
identical
rights
and
are
treated
as
parties
in
the
board
proceeding.
and
therefore,
they
should
be
similarly
be
treated
as
parties
in
the
section
10
(l)
proceeding.
we
would
then
also
allude
to
the
guidance
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
can
give
with
respect
to
the
question
of
charging
party
rights.
when
we
say
that
we
are
party,
we
use
the
word
party
with
three
specific
exceptions.
so,
there
is
no
mistake.
we
do
not
say
we
are
the
kind
of
juridical
party
that
one
is
outside
is
the
framework
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
say
first,
that
we
do
not
seek
injunctive
relief
in
section
10
(l),
but
rather
we
simply
support
that
which
director
has
done.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
to
recap
for
one
moment
with
respect
to
the
--
how
this
case
arises
and
how
the
appeal
comes
to
this
court.
when
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
denied
the
injunctive
relief
which
the
regional
director
had
sought,
and
it
was
in
that
proceeding.
the
charging
party
sears,
the
respondent
union,
and
the
board
all
appeared
by
counsel
and
all
participated
as
provided
in
the
act.
the
district
court
justice
--
judge
held
that
there
was
little
probability
that
the
board
would
find
a
violation
of
law,
and
therefore
denied
the
injunctive
relief.
after
this
decision,
the
regional
director
continued
in
his
belief
that
there
was
in
fact
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
existed.
we
had
--
we
attempted
to
convince
the
regional
director
to
seek
and
to
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
that
request
and
those
request
were
without
avail,
and
as
a
time
for
filing
appeal
drew
near
faced
with
the
continued
picketing
of
sears
at
its
denver
locations
faced
with
the
director's
continued
belief
there
was
a
violation
and
with
the
director's
refusal
to
file
an
appeal,
we
on
behalf
of
the
charging
party
filed
an
appeal.
there
were
then
motions
to
dismiss
that
appeal
for
lack
of
standing
filed
both
by
the
board
and
by
the
union.
i
should
add
there
was
one
further
intervening
factor
which
perhaps
has
some
significance
to
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
raised
by
the
counsel
for
the
regional
director.
after
the
appeal
had
been
filed,
the
trial
examiner
who
heard
the
facts
of
the
underlying
case
in
the
first
instance
came
down
with
a
favorable
decision
for
sears.
he
found
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
secondary
boycott
section
of
the
act
had
been
violated.
it
was
within
a
few
days
of
that
decision
that
we
again
wrote
to
the
general
counsel
and
requested
two
things.
we
requested
first,
that
perhaps
the
general
counsel,
since
the
picketing
was
still
continuing,
would
seek
injunctive
relief
under
the
discretionary
section,
section
10
(j)
of
the
act,
and
admittedly,
we
were
aware
of
no
case
which
permitted
were
the
board
had
gone
for
injunctive
relief
under
section
10
(j),
even
though
this
was
an
area
that
was
covered
by
10
(l),
but
the
language
of
the
act
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
it
was
possible.
we
ask
secondly
of
the
board
once
more
that
they
join
us
in
the
appeal.
the
board
responded
within
the
few
days
indicating
that
they
did
not
choose
to
file
for
10
(j)
relief,
even
if
that
was
available
and
furthermore,
they
did
not
seek
to
join
us
in
the
appeal.
the
only
reason
they
gave
was
at
the
time
for
them
to
join
us
in
the
appeal
had
disappeared.
i
think
that
exchange
of
letters
only
has
become
significant
and
we
have
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
in
view
of
the
board's
--
one
of
the
board's
contentions
here,
that
--
and
that
same
contention
made
below
that
if
the
charging
party
were
to
be
given
the
right
of
appeal
and
were
to
be
given
party
rights
subject
to
the
limitations
which
i've
started
to
outline
before
the
luncheon
break,
that
would
amount
to
the
board's
losing
control.
and
the
particular
--
and
the
board
speaks
of
control
in
a
number
of
instances.
there
was
one
kind
of
control
which
the
board's
speaks
of
in
the
case
before
the
district
court,
and
there's
another
kind
of
control
the
board
addresses
itself
to
with
respect
to
the
decision
whether
or
not
it
should
appeal.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
kind
of
control,
i
had
started
to
say
that
there
are
--
what
we
contended
are,
we
have
rights
of
a
party
subject
to
three
limitations.
the
first
is
that
we
do
not
seek
the
injunctive
relief.
we
simply
support
that
which
the
board
has
done,
and
we
take
to
position
that
once
the
regional
director
has
filed
his
petition
for
injunctive
relief
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
statute,
giving
us
the
right
to
be
heard,
we
have
the
right
to
support
that
decision.
and
we
have
--
we
relied
in
the
tenth
circuit
upon
the
retail
clerk's
case,
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerk's
case,
and
we
would
contend
that
the
reasoning
of
that
court
with
respect
to
this
question
is
indeed
sound.
the
second
limitation
that
we
would
say
would
afford
to
a
charging
party
is
the
fact
that
the
charging
party
at
no
time
may
enlarge
or
urge
an
enlargement
of
the
positions
taken
by
the
director
in
the
petitioner
that
he
filed
with
the
district
court.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
would
distinguished
the
decision
that
justice
marshall
then
--
judge
marshall
rendered
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
mcleod
case
because
it
was
--
in
that
case,
and
the
board
and
the
union
have
cited
the
mcleod
case
as
proposition
for
the
fact
that
charging
party
should
not
be
granted
this
right
because
it's
violative
of
norris-laguardia.
and
in
the
mcleod
case
as
in
--
that
whole
line
of
cases,
it
is
clear
that
where
the
charging
party
enlarges
upon
something
which
the
director
seeking
in
the
mcleod
case,
the
charging
party
was
urging
that
there
was
some
handbilling
in
that
case
and
the
charging
of
party
was
urging
that
there
was
some
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
the
handbilling.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
question
of
misrepresentation
was
not
one
of
the
basis
upon
which
the
board
had
sought
its
petition.
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
the
charging
party
was
urging
a
different
result,
to
that
extent,
there
could
be
a
violation
of
norris-laguardia.
finally,
with
respect
--
and
the
district
court
--
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
dismissed
or
granted
the
board
and
union's
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
standing
on
essentially
three
grounds.
first
that
the
relief
here
would
constitute
a
violation
of
norris-laguardia
and
they
contend
the
reason
for
that
is
in
effect,
they
would
be
granting
injunctive
relief
to
a
charging
party.
secondly,
the
case
that
we
cite
and
cited
to
them
and
cited
in
our
brief,
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case,
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
position
that
that
case
really
only
refer
to
the
rights
of
charging
parties
in
the
district
court,
and
therefore
was
not
apposite
or
helpful
to
them
in
determining
whether
or
not
we
would
have
standing
to
appeal
and
have
any
rights
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
and
finally,
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
statutory
language
that
charging
parties
shall
be
represented
by
counsel
and
present
relevant
testimony
means
that
and
no
more.
now,
with
respect
to
the
last,
perhaps
first,
whether
the
language
means
that
and
no
more,
we
would
then
turn
to
the
first,
what
part
of
our
argument,
and
we
would
say
that
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
fact
that
charging
parties,
the
same
party
who
is
before
the
district
court
in
the
10
(l)
proceeding
also
proceeds
in
the
case
before
the
board.
and
in
that
board
case,
it
is
true
that
the
charging
party
is
referred
to
as
a
party,
but
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
this
court
had
held
in
scofield,
the
court
looks
to
the
overall
concern
and
the
overall
concern
in
this
act
is
the
protection
of
charging
party
rights.
and
particularly
here,
there
is
even
a
stronger
protection
with
respect
to
the
neutral
in
an
8
(b)
(4)
situation
where
there
is
a
mandatory
requirement
to
seek
relief.
but
in
the
board
proceeding,
the
charging
party
participates
at
all
levels
in
the
investigation,
in
the
issuance
of
complaint,
in
settlement,
in
hearings,
appeals
and
so
forth.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
we
would
contend
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
that
--
we
would
definitely
--
our
position
is
that
our
rights
only
vest
after
the
regional
director
has
made
his
determination.
and
should
he
change
his
mind
and
there
is
a
possibility
that
in
a
particular
kind
of
situation,
he
might
change
his
mind.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
i
would
say
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
one
of
the
board's
principle
arguments
is
that
very
fact
that
the
statute
is
silent.
we
would
answer
that
in
three
ways.
first,
that
that
scheme
of
the
act,
in
other
words,
since
the
charging
parties
have
these
rights
in
the
board
case,
they
also
have
these
rights
in
the
district
court
case.
and
then,
we
have
cited
this
court
to
the
only
case
that
we
have
unable
to
find
on
the
--
trying
to
define
on
appeal
the
--
justice
marshall's
decision
in
the
marbury
versus
madison,
and
we
would
contend
that
an
appeal
by
its
very
nature
is
not
the
institution
of
a
new
cause
and
is
simply
to
correct
of
that
which
was
done
below.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
if
the
--
your
honor,
if
the
regional
director
took
that
position,
we
would
take
--
we
would
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
--
it
is
still
for
the
charging
party
to
urge
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
correctness
of
the
director's
petition.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i
see.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well
this
--
your
honor,
this
is
exactly
again
was
the
situation
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
and
in
that
situation,
the
charging
party,
the
regional
director
which
would
happen
fairly
frequently
in
this
board
cases
is
that
many
times,
the
union
and
the
director
will
seek
to
--
the
union
will
say
we'll
stop
picketing
while
we
resolve
the
underlying
dispute,
and
the
union
will
offer
a
stipulation.
and
there
are
times
such
as
in
the
amicus
case
here
in
the
terminal
freight
case
where
the
charging
party
will
object
to
that
stipulation.
that
is
one
situation
where
it
arises.
we
would
contend
that
the
charging
party
has
the
right
as
it
did
--
as
the
court
found
in
the
ninth
circuit
case
to
urge
to
the
court
that
there
is
fact
reasonable
cause.
since
the
director
found
reasonable
cause,
it
is
for
now
for
the
court
to
determine
and
the
court
is
not
simply
a
rubberstamp
with
respect
to
what
the
director
has
done.
the
court
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
and
it
must
make
up
its
mind
and
the
statute
10
(l)
gives
the
party
the
right
to
be
heard.
certainly,
it
gives
the
party
the
right
to
present
relevant
testimony.
we
would
say
that
that
right
to
present
testimony
does
not
mean
just
that
and
no
more,
because
that
would
not
be
a
logical
result.
it
--
apart
from
that,
it
has
work
otherwise.
example
again
in
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well
your
honor
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
there
was
--
if
i
could
--
i
will
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
i
would
contend
two
things
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
taft-hartley.
i
would
contend
first
that
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
discussed,
the
legislative
history
is
silent.
with
respect
to
specific
reference
to
these
words
in
the
statute,
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
relevant
testimony.
now,
we
submit
that
first
so
far
as
that
silence
is
concerned
just
the
silence
alone.
that
silence
does
not
necessary
militate
against
us.
and
your
honors
in
the
two
decision
rendered
this
morning
and
i
was
familiar
with
one
because
i
had
kept
off
with
the
briefs,
particular
in
the
barlow
case
that
the
court
said
it
is
however
only
upon
a
showing
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
a
contrary
legislative
intent
that
the
court
should
restrict
access
to
judicial
review.
the
framers
of
taft-hartley,
i
think
we
have
to
look
--
in
view
of
the
silence
with
respect
to
the
specific
language,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
context
in
which
the
debates
occurred.
and
that
context
was
that
the
debates
on
taft-hartley
occurred
in
1948,
the
spring
1948.
pardon
me,
in
the
spring
of
---
yes,
in
the
spring
of
1948.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i'm
sorry,
the
spring
of
1947.
and
at
that
time,
the
debates
occurred
in
the
context
of
the
senate
being
concern
with
president
truman
again,
vetoing
in
measure,
and
it
was
in
the
80th
congress
this
debates
occurred.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
cited
the
court,
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
deliberations
that
occurred
in
the
79th
congress,
because
it
is
only
by
looking
to
that
background
that
we
see
the
light
in
which
the
court
was
--
the
congress
was
concerned
with
private
party
rights.
at
that
time,
two
things
were
clear.
it
was
clear
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
protecting
neutrals,
and
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
were
enacted.
it
was
also
clear
that
what
it
transpired
between
the
enactment
of
norris-laguardia
and
the
wagner
act
and
up
till
that
time
was
unsatisfactory
in
terms
of
getting
injunctive
protection
where
there
was
a
neutral
or
where
there
was
a
wrong
party.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley,
the
board
would
first
have
to
make
a
determination
on
the
merits
where
there
was
a
violation.
and
one
of
the
purposes
was
that
there
would
be
a
prior
determination
but
that
prior
determination
has
the
statute
finally
evolved
was
to
be
only
upon
decision
by
the
regional
director
where
there
was
a
violation.
but
in
the
79th
congress,
the
case
bill
passed
both
houses
and
that
bill
provided
that
private
parties
as
well
as
the
board
could
seek
injunctive
relief.
and
it
passed
both
houses
of
congress.
president
truman
vetoed
that
bill.
but
then
--
and
there
weren't
sufficient
votes
to
override
the
veto.
immediately
at
the
convening
of
the
80th
congress,
a
bill
almost
identical
to
the
case
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate,
which
is
bill
s.55,
and
it
was
on
that
bill
that
hearings
were
held
in
the
senate
labor
committee.
at
the
same
time
in
the
house,
there
was
a
bill
which
passed
identical
to
the
case
bill
again
giving
rights
to
private
parties.
it
became
clear
however
to
--
certainly
to
senator
taft
that
if
there
was
going
to
either
be
no
veto,
and
if
there
was
going
to
getting
legislation,
there
had
to
be
some
compromise,
and
time
was
of
the
essence
the
--
that
government
was
operating
the
minds
as
the
smith-connolly
act
was
going
to
expire
in
a
few
months,
and
senator
taft
was
the
one
who
is
to
compromiser,
and
the
evidence
of
his
compromise
specifically
with
respect
to
the
question
of
private
party
rights
and
private
party
rights
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
temporary
injunctions
comes
from
the
procedures.
s.55
as
i
say
was
in
the
senate
labor
committee.
out
of
that
committee
was
--
came
a
committee
report
and
a
new
bill.
the
new
bill
was
called
in
the
88th
congress
s.1126.
and
so
far
as
section
10
(l)
was
concerned
and
so
far
as
the
rights
of
charging
parties
are
concerned,
the
words
i
referred
to
they
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
s.1126,
and
subsequently
have
remained
unchanged
in
the
statute.
however,
when
it
was
reported
out
of
committee,
senator
taft,
senator
ball,
senator
o'daniel
and
one
other
senator,
all
indicated
that
they
would
reserve
the
right
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
again
introduce
once
more
an
amendment
to
permit
private
parties
to
institute
these
rights.
now,
why
was
this
concerned?
because
they
were
concerned
that
the
private
party
was
the
aggrieved
party.
the
private
party
was
the
one
who
should
be
protected
and
they
were
concerned
that
perhaps
the
board
wouldn't
afford
sufficient
protection.
when
and
although
senator
taft,
at
the
time
that
it
was
reported
out
of
committee,
still
favored
private
party
rights
shortly
when
the
debates
began
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
we've
cited
that
in
the
briefs,
he
changed
his
position,
and
the
schism
came
when
senator
ball
was
the
one
who
introduced
the
amendment
for
a
private
party
rights
again
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
senator
taft
at
that
point
said
that
he
could
not
go
forward.
he
would
offer
another
compromise,
and
that
the
--
if
the
act
was
to
be
passed,
it
would
have
to
be
passed
without
the
rights
of
private
party
seeking
that
relief.
and
therefore,
i
say
that
since
there
was
such
concern
with
the
rights
of
private
parties,
the
words
of
section
10
(l)
should
not
be
read
narrowly
as
the
board
suggests.
but
rather
they
should
be
given
broader
interpretation.
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
oh
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
i
would
say
the
conflict
--
i
would
say
the
conflict
arises
specifically
between
the
tenth
circuit
decision
here
holding
these
words
to
be
in
exactly
what
they
say,
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
the
ninth
circuit
--
well,
i
would
call
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well,
there
is
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
this
and
i
didn't
cite
it
specifically.
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
that
i
think
has
most
bearing
on
this
subject
is
the
mcleod
versus
the
business
and
mechanics
conference
case,
i
believe
it
was
a
1961
case,
and
that
was
the
case
where
the
decision
was
written
by
judge
marshall
--
justice
marshall.
and
in
that
situation,
i
recited
the
case
briefly
for
another
proposition
with
respect
to
the
charging
party
taking
a
position
not
urge
by
the
board.
but
the
interesting
thing
about
that
case
is
that
the
charging
party
was
there
at
all.
i
mean
the
charging
party
in
that
proceeding
and
we
did
not
intervene.
the
charging
party
in
that
proceeding
was
there
as
a
party,
and
the
charging
party
argued
as
a
party
and
there
was
no
--
that
although
the
court
was
silent
with
respect
to
that
status,
perhaps
the
question
wasn't'
raised,
but
certainly
inferentially,
that
case
would
seem
to
go
along
with
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit,
although
ninth
circuit
came
much
later.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
another
interesting
factor
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
and
that
is
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
--
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
set
forth
certain
headings,
and
while
the
tenth
circuit
tries
to
distinguished
the
case
with
respect
to
saying
the
case
only
stands
for
the
proposition
that
--
it
is
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
whether
or
not
injunctive
relief
would
be
granted.
in
reality,
the
headings
that
i've
reference
to
it,
it
is
rather
unusual
to
see
specific
headings
said
to
an
opinion.
all
of
the
discussion
with
respect
to
charging
party
rights
is
in
heading
roman
numeral
ii,
and
it
is
an
uppercase,
and
it
says
to
whom
was
the
temporary
injunction
granted?
and
that's
at
351
f.2d
528.
we
have
cited
the
case,
but
not
made
specific
reference
to
that.
and
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
on
the
one
hand
discussing
the
charging
party
rights,
and
on
the
other
hand
discussing
the
question
of
its
own
authority
for
when
it
was
talking
about
its
own
authority.
the
heading
is
“allege
abuse
of
discretion”
and
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
board
they're
appealed
and
claim
that
the
court
had
abused
its
discretion
when
it
granted
the
injunction
because
the
board
orders
that
the
injunction
had
been
granted
to
the
charge
of
parties.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
scofield
case,
insofar
as
it
sheds
light
on
this
question.
i
think
the
general
concept
--
i
think
the
position
of
the
board
and
the
union
and
the
court
has
been
scofield
is
to
be
read
narrowly,
and
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
scofield
stands
more
than
just
for
the
proposition,
the
question
of
multiplicity
of
suits
that
occurred
in
that
context.
scofield
stands
for
the
proposition
that
it
recognizes
private
rights.
in
fact
for
the
concept
of
recognition
of
private
rights,
this
court
cited
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case
which
had
earlier
reached
a
same
conclusion
and
the
court
spoke
in
terms
general
fairness.
the
court
recognized
also
that
the
status
of
the
amicus
was
not
status
enough.
i
will
reserve
my
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
should
first
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
union
counsel's
argument
that
unions
also
are
beneficiaries
under
section
10
(l).
they
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
an
8
(e)
situation
where
there's
a
hot
cargo
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case,
it
was
the
union
who
was
the
charging
party
and
it
was
the
union
who
was
seeking
to
appeal
and
so
that
the
unions
in
those
situations
as
well
an
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
situation
where
the
attempt
to
enforce
of
coercively
enforce
illegal
8
(d)
contract
and
also
in
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
construction
industry
jurisdictional
cases,
the
union
is
the
charging
party.
secondly,
so
far
as
the
cases
have
decided
the
appellate
review,
the
union
counsel
suggests
that
they
have
all
given
charging
party
only
amicus
status.
i
would
suggest,
your
honors
that
this
is
the
first
case
where
the
issue
has
a
reason
where
the
--
it
involves
a
charging
party
which
is
an
appellant.
and
there
is
considerable
difference
because
in
the
retail
clerks
case,
although
the
charging
party
was
relegated
to
amicus
status,
i'm
glad
that
i
have
to
refer
the
court
back
to
the
appendix,
to
our
reply
brief
on
the
--
an
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert.
that's
supplemental
appendix
a-43.
in
that
appendix,
that
appendix
reflects
the
fact
that
the
charging
party
which
was
only
granted
amicus
status
however
presented
oral
argument
and
presented
briefs
and
in
fact,
in
the
context
of
the
case
where
the
only
ones
to
present
that
position.
conversely,
in
our
situation
if
we
are
not
granted
party
status,
we
will
be
precluded
from
appealing
from
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief.
and
if
the
board's
argument
on
control
is
to
hold,
i
would
submit
the
board's
argument
control,
on
control
is
wholly
without
reason
primarily
because
the
board
is
suggesting
that
it
could
be
in
the
position
of
on
the
one
hand
having
found
reasonable
cause
what
was
mandatorily
required
to
proceed
with
the
act.
on
the
other
hand,
still
maintaining
their
reasonable
cause,
still
going
forth
with
the
underlying
case
but
suddenly
deciding
that
for
some
reason,
there
might
be
something
that
in
appealing
the
10
(l)
situation
might
interfere
with
its
ultimate
victory
in
the
underlying
case.
i
would
submit
that
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
their
fear,
fine!
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
will
and
then
the
board
perhaps
will
have
to
pull
out
of
the
underlying
case.
but
so
long
as
they
maintain
reasonable
cause,
so
long
as
they
don't
their
mind
about
the
underlying
case,
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
a
mandatory
obligation
to
go
forward
but
certainly,
they
have
--
they
cannot
take
the
position
that
they
must
have
control.
they
have
the
control.
they
can
change
their
mind
on
reasonable
cause
that
is
the
only
kind
of
control.
and
i
would
submit
in
analyzing
the
question
of
control,
we
must
look
to
the
kind
of
control
the
board
has
urged
even
in
the
court
below.
the
board
--
the
board
would
say
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
said,
the
language
of
10
(l)
means
that
and
no
more
but
conversely,
again
looking
at
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
board
in
charging,
in
charge
cases,
the
charging
party
has
many
rights
that
interfere
with
the
board's
control.
the
board
for
example
cannot
withdraw
its
complaint
in
the
board
case
once
having
gone
to
hearing
without
giving
the
charging
party
rights.
the
board
cannot
settle
the
board
case
once
having
gone
to
complaint
without
the
charging
party
being
heard.
i
think
these
are
the
kind
and
i'm
saying
that
that
scheme
of
the
act
is
also
transposed
to
the
language
of
being
heard
being
the
fact
that
it's
the
same
charging
party.
i
would
further
argue
the
answer
to
the
norris-la
guardia
argument.
mr.
manoli
gave
us
a
number
of
quotes
both
on
argument
and
from
his
brief
with
respect
to
the
fears.
well,
the
persons
who
are
enunciating
the
fears
at
that
time,
they
were
enunciating
the
fears
that
the
passage
of
taft-hartley
would
return
us
to
norris-la
guardia
and
the
very
fear
that
they
were
concerned
about
was
the
fear
that
anyone
be
at
the
board
or
private
parties
would
seek
injunctive
relief
before
the
merits
were
decided
and
i
would
submit
that
the
congress
acted
very
wisely
in
giving
the
--
in
entrusting
the
board
with
their
responsibility
of
seeking
that
relief.
because
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
9,
footnote
6
--
footnote
3,
pardon
me,
the
board's
record
is
excellent
taking
1967
as
a
typical
year
and
the
only
reason
we
took
1967
was
because
we
wanted
to
see
what
happened
to
all
those
10
(l)
cases
where
the
board
went
to
final
order.
there
was
69
cases
in
that
year.
there
were
many
other
10
(l)
they
had
issued
on
165
and
they
were
almost
1500,
1800
charges
under
these
sections.
but
the
significant
fact
is
that
in
those
cases
where
they
went
to
final
order
where
injunctive
relief
was
either
granted
or
denied,
and
the
ultimate
board
litigation
only
one
case
was
their
cause
to
find
that
the
regional
director's
original
cause,
original
basis
for
reasonable
cause
was
an
error.
so,
i
would
submit
that
the
board
is
wise
that
the
persons,
the
charged
party
has
not
generally
been
disadvantaged
in
terms
of
the
regional
director
not
being
sustained
in
his
finding
of
reasonable
cause.
and
i
would
--
i
submit,
the
finding
of
reasonable
cause
is
the
central
issue
and
so
long
as
the
regional
director
maintains
that
reasonable
cause,
he
cannot
say
that
he
does
not
have
control
because
that
is
the
element
of
control.
simply
so
far
as
the
henderson
case
which
counsels
of
both
side,
and
i
would
say
is
not
very
convincing.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
retail
clerks
case
went
to
a
great
length
to
try
to
analyze
the
question.
the
henderson
case
was
simply
a
summary
discussion
and
really
only
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
amicus
or
intervention
status
at
the
appellate
level
and
that
is
inconsistent,
first
of
all
with
the
retail
clerks
case
with
respect
to
that
question.
and
i
would
submit
that
there
is
however
a
more
fundamental
question
when
we
are
appellants.
because
in
order
to
appeal,
we
must
be
considered
a
party
and
as
i
have
said,
a
party
minus
the
right
to
seek,
a
party
minus
the
right
to
urge
other
positions
not
consistent
with
the
original
position
and
perhaps
as
moore
suggest,
perhaps
there
is
some
third
animal
in
the
law
which
could
come
out
in
this
case.
something
less
--
something
less
than
a
full
party
because
we
can't
do
all
those
other
things
but
yet
someone
having
the
rights
of
a
party
and
someone
who
has
--
where
the
rights
of
the
amicus
are
not
sufficient
as
the
court
has
said
in
schofield.
thank
you.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
determination
of
the
status
of
charging
parties
under
section
10
(l)
of
the
act,
specifically,
whether
they
have
standing
to
appeal
denial
of
temporary
injunctive
relief.
section
10
(l)
of
the
act
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
it
provides
whenever
it
is
charge
that
any
person
has
engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
(b)
and
(c),
and
specifically
here
that
charging
party
is
a
neutral
employer
in
a
charge
involving
violations
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b),
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
act.
so
the
charging
party
is
one
of
the
person's
contemplated
for
protection
under
section
10
(l).
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
the
preliminary
investigation
of
such
charge
shall
be
made
forthwith
and
be
given
priority
over
all
cases.
in
this
particular
case
sears
roebuck,
the
petitioner
filed
a
charge
with
the
nlrb,
and
the
nlrb
proceeded
to
make
such
investigation.
statute
then
goes
on
to
say
if
after
such
investigation,
the
officer
or
regional
attorney
to
whom
the
matter
may
be
refer
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
such
charge
is
true,
and
that
a
complaint
should
issue,
he
shall
on
behalf
of
the
board,
petition
a
district
court
for
injunctive
relief.
in
this
particular
case,
the
regional
director
for
the
nlrb
in
denver
made
such
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause,
and
he
follow
the
statutory
mandate
and
sought
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
colorado.
it
is
our
position
that
the
charging
party
or
neutral
--
a
neutral
party
such
as
sears
is
in
this
case
is
the
very
person
whom
congress
when
it
enacted,
not
only
the
8
(b)
(4)
provisions,
the
secondary
boycott
provision
at
the
time
of
taft-hartley,
but
also
section
10
(l),
the
mandatory
requirement
that
the
government
seek
injunctive
relief
is
the
party
for
whose
benefit,
in
addition
of
course
to
the
public
a
benefit,
for
whose
benefit
the
relief
is
being
sought.
specifically,
the
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
justice
harlan,
the
statute
says
only
this
with
respect
to
the
role
of
the
charging
party.
upon
filing
of
any
such
petition,
the
courts
shall
cause
notice
thereof
to
be
served
upon
any
person
involved
in
the
charge.
and
such
person,
including
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
any
relevant
testimony.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
statute
specifically
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
your
honor?
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
it
is
--
the
terms
do
not
explicitly
refer
to
the
charging
party
is
a
party
acceptance
so
far
as
the
word
party
is
used
together
with
charging.
but
it
is
our
contention
and
we
will
demonstrate
to
this
court
as
we
believe
we
have
in
our
briefs
that
in
reading
--
in
looking
to
the
entire
scheme
of
the
act,
in
other
words,
the
role,
the
charging
party's
play
in
the
board
proceeding
because
the
same
charge
which
sears
roebuck
here
filed
gave
rise
to
two
proceedings,
and
gave
rise
to
two
concurrent
actions.
in
fact
it
happens
in
this
case,
they
were
on
the
same
day,
although,
they
need
them
to
bid.
in
this
particular
case,
the
regional
director
issued
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
alleging
that
the
carpet
layers
respondent
union
here
was
violating
or
he
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
respondent
union
was
violating
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
act,
and
similarly,
filed
a
petition
for
injunctive
relief.
those
two
cases
are
still
very
much
alive.
and
the
regional
director
at
all
times,
critical
to
our
contention
here
has
continued
to
maintain
that
reasonable
belief
or
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
union
has
violated
the
law
or
was
in
the
process
of
violating
the
law.
for
had,
the
regional
director
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
there
is
a
question
if
this
court
would
--
will
wish
to
hear
argument
on
that
question.
i
certainly
would
toward
the
end
of
my
argument.
i'll
be
happy
to
present
our
contentions
on
mootness.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes,
i'm
sure
he
is.
well,
essentially
on
the
mootness
question,
very
briefly,
the
major
position
that
we
would
take
with
respect
to
mootness
is
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
issues
involved
--
that
the
orders
involved
here
are
short-term
orders.
specifically,
injunctive
relief
under
section
10
(l)
of
the
act
is
the
kind
of
relief
that
normally
expires
because
the
dispute
is
resolved.
and
so
that
if
there
are
some
problem
with
respect
to
the
correctness
of
the
standing
of
parties
in
that
proceeding,
this
court
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
resolve
that
question
if
it
were
to
wait
--
if
it
could
not
do
so
at
that
time.
and
so
under
the
doctrine
of
the
southern
pacific
terminal
case
and
more
recently
as
this
court
said
last
year
in
the
moore
versus
ogilvie,
these
are
important
public
questions
that
will
come
up
again,
and
that
should
--
that
are
not
rendered
moot
because
of
the
continuing
effect
not
only
upon
sears
in
this
case
and
another
cases,
but
other
parties
similarly
situated
and
would
escape
review
but
for
the
mootness
doctrine.
therefore,
the
mootness
doctrine
would
be
set
aside.
we
also
contend
that
the
case
is
not
factually
moot.
we
say
it
is
not
factually
moot
because
for
a
number
of
reasons.
specifically
that
as
in
the
--
as
in
bakery
drivers
versus
wagshal,
the
union
here
to
the
extent
that
it
has
stop
picketing
what
whatever
we
can
infer
from
that,
we
can
only
infer
that
it
did
stop
picketing
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
board.
and
more
specifically,
the
union
maintains
the
correctness
of
its
position
and
has
so
argued
that
correctness
of
its
position,
january
22nd
this
year
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
maintaining
that
it
believes
and
continues
to
believe
that
the
picketing
of
sears
roebuck
was
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
so
that
so
long
as
this
controversy
and
the
underlying
dispute
remains,
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
the
picketing
will
resume,
and
that
possibility
would
come
about,
should
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
where
the
--
and
what
happened
here
in
the
underlying
cases
that
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
found
the
union
to
have
violated
section
8
(b)
(4).
the
union
moved
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
that
decision
and
the
sears
roebuck
intervened
and
the
board
cross
petition
for
enforcement
of
that
decision.
and
in
the
event,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
remands
to
the
board
there
are
number
of
possibilities
as
to
what
can
arise
in
that
case.
should
there
be
a
remand,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
also
then
the
possibility
of
a
renewal
of
picketing
because
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
something
further
the
board
might
have
to
do.
in
any
event,
so
far
as
the
factual
mootness,
it
is
our
further
contention
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
so
far
as
the
time
during
which
the
injunctive
provision
runs.
in
other
words,
in
section
10
(l),
section
10
(l)
states
that
the
injunction
--
that
the
court
shall
grant
such
injunctive
relief
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
so,
there
is
another
question
although
it
is
perhaps
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
resolve
that
question.
if
it
resolves
the
question
of
mootness
on
the
southern
pacific
terminal
and
moore
versus
ogilvie
line
of
cases,
it
is
perhaps
not
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
interpretation
of
those
words
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board.
but
it
is
our
position
that
pending
final
adjudication
of
the
board
means
when
the
matter
has
finally
been
resolved
by
the
board
and
that
a
settlement
will
be
a
final
resolution.
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
it
has
not
been
finally
been
resolved
by
the
board
because
of
the
possibility
of
the
remand,
because
in
that
situation,
the
board
would
have
to
do
the
something
further,
and
we
recognized
the
fact
that
there
is
a
final
board
order
here
from
which
the
union
appeals
the
statutory
language
is
not
clear,
but
we
would
contend
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
final
adjudication.
we
have
no
authority
other
than
logic
and
reason
to
support
that
position.
our
argument
--
before
i
pass
on
to
the
argument,
i
should
briefly
summarize
any
facts
that
i
have
in
my
opening
remarks
not
alluded
to.
in
this
particular
case,
the
picketing
and
the
picketing
of
sears
roebuck
continued
for
a
period
of
10
months.
there
was
--
the
argument
your
honor
essentially
falls
into
two
or
three
categories.
our
major
contention
is
that
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
this
court
has
consider
the
scheme
of
the
act
in
its
scofield
decision
renders
that
charging
parties
should
have
the
right
to
appeal.
the
reason
for
--
specifically,
what
we
would
urge
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
that
charging
parties
possess
the
very
rights
that
are
set
forth
in
section
10
(l).
they
possess
those
identical
rights
and
are
treated
as
parties
in
the
board
proceeding.
and
therefore,
they
should
be
similarly
be
treated
as
parties
in
the
section
10
(l)
proceeding.
we
would
then
also
allude
to
the
guidance
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
can
give
with
respect
to
the
question
of
charging
party
rights.
when
we
say
that
we
are
party,
we
use
the
word
party
with
three
specific
exceptions.
so,
there
is
no
mistake.
we
do
not
say
we
are
the
kind
of
juridical
party
that
one
is
outside
is
the
framework
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
say
first,
that
we
do
not
seek
injunctive
relief
in
section
10
(l),
but
rather
we
simply
support
that
which
director
has
done.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
to
recap
for
one
moment
with
respect
to
the
--
how
this
case
arises
and
how
the
appeal
comes
to
this
court.
when
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
denied
the
injunctive
relief
which
the
regional
director
had
sought,
and
it
was
in
that
proceeding.
the
charging
party
sears,
the
respondent
union,
and
the
board
all
appeared
by
counsel
and
all
participated
as
provided
in
the
act.
the
district
court
justice
--
judge
held
that
there
was
little
probability
that
the
board
would
find
a
violation
of
law,
and
therefore
denied
the
injunctive
relief.
after
this
decision,
the
regional
director
continued
in
his
belief
that
there
was
in
fact
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
existed.
we
had
--
we
attempted
to
convince
the
regional
director
to
seek
and
to
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
that
request
and
those
request
were
without
avail,
and
as
a
time
for
filing
appeal
drew
near
faced
with
the
continued
picketing
of
sears
at
its
denver
locations
faced
with
the
director's
continued
belief
there
was
a
violation
and
with
the
director's
refusal
to
file
an
appeal,
we
on
behalf
of
the
charging
party
filed
an
appeal.
there
were
then
motions
to
dismiss
that
appeal
for
lack
of
standing
filed
both
by
the
board
and
by
the
union.
i
should
add
there
was
one
further
intervening
factor
which
perhaps
has
some
significance
to
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
raised
by
the
counsel
for
the
regional
director.
after
the
appeal
had
been
filed,
the
trial
examiner
who
heard
the
facts
of
the
underlying
case
in
the
first
instance
came
down
with
a
favorable
decision
for
sears.
he
found
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
secondary
boycott
section
of
the
act
had
been
violated.
it
was
within
a
few
days
of
that
decision
that
we
again
wrote
to
the
general
counsel
and
requested
two
things.
we
requested
first,
that
perhaps
the
general
counsel,
since
the
picketing
was
still
continuing,
would
seek
injunctive
relief
under
the
discretionary
section,
section
10
(j)
of
the
act,
and
admittedly,
we
were
aware
of
no
case
which
permitted
were
the
board
had
gone
for
injunctive
relief
under
section
10
(j),
even
though
this
was
an
area
that
was
covered
by
10
(l),
but
the
language
of
the
act
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
it
was
possible.
we
ask
secondly
of
the
board
once
more
that
they
join
us
in
the
appeal.
the
board
responded
within
the
few
days
indicating
that
they
did
not
choose
to
file
for
10
(j)
relief,
even
if
that
was
available
and
furthermore,
they
did
not
seek
to
join
us
in
the
appeal.
the
only
reason
they
gave
was
at
the
time
for
them
to
join
us
in
the
appeal
had
disappeared.
i
think
that
exchange
of
letters
only
has
become
significant
and
we
have
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
in
view
of
the
board's
--
one
of
the
board's
contentions
here,
that
--
and
that
same
contention
made
below
that
if
the
charging
party
were
to
be
given
the
right
of
appeal
and
were
to
be
given
party
rights
subject
to
the
limitations
which
i've
started
to
outline
before
the
luncheon
break,
that
would
amount
to
the
board's
losing
control.
and
the
particular
--
and
the
board
speaks
of
control
in
a
number
of
instances.
there
was
one
kind
of
control
which
the
board's
speaks
of
in
the
case
before
the
district
court,
and
there's
another
kind
of
control
the
board
addresses
itself
to
with
respect
to
the
decision
whether
or
not
it
should
appeal.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
kind
of
control,
i
had
started
to
say
that
there
are
--
what
we
contended
are,
we
have
rights
of
a
party
subject
to
three
limitations.
the
first
is
that
we
do
not
seek
the
injunctive
relief.
we
simply
support
that
which
the
board
has
done,
and
we
take
to
position
that
once
the
regional
director
has
filed
his
petition
for
injunctive
relief
by
virtue
of
the
language
in
the
statute,
giving
us
the
right
to
be
heard,
we
have
the
right
to
support
that
decision.
and
we
have
--
we
relied
in
the
tenth
circuit
upon
the
retail
clerk's
case,
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerk's
case,
and
we
would
contend
that
the
reasoning
of
that
court
with
respect
to
this
question
is
indeed
sound.
the
second
limitation
that
we
would
say
would
afford
to
a
charging
party
is
the
fact
that
the
charging
party
at
no
time
may
enlarge
or
urge
an
enlargement
of
the
positions
taken
by
the
director
in
the
petitioner
that
he
filed
with
the
district
court.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
would
distinguished
the
decision
that
justice
marshall
then
--
judge
marshall
rendered
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
mcleod
case
because
it
was
--
in
that
case,
and
the
board
and
the
union
have
cited
the
mcleod
case
as
proposition
for
the
fact
that
charging
party
should
not
be
granted
this
right
because
it's
violative
of
norris-laguardia.
and
in
the
mcleod
case
as
in
--
that
whole
line
of
cases,
it
is
clear
that
where
the
charging
party
enlarges
upon
something
which
the
director
seeking
in
the
mcleod
case,
the
charging
party
was
urging
that
there
was
some
handbilling
in
that
case
and
the
charging
of
party
was
urging
that
there
was
some
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
the
handbilling.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
question
of
misrepresentation
was
not
one
of
the
basis
upon
which
the
board
had
sought
its
petition.
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
the
charging
party
was
urging
a
different
result,
to
that
extent,
there
could
be
a
violation
of
norris-laguardia.
finally,
with
respect
--
and
the
district
court
--
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
dismissed
or
granted
the
board
and
union's
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
standing
on
essentially
three
grounds.
first
that
the
relief
here
would
constitute
a
violation
of
norris-laguardia
and
they
contend
the
reason
for
that
is
in
effect,
they
would
be
granting
injunctive
relief
to
a
charging
party.
secondly,
the
case
that
we
cite
and
cited
to
them
and
cited
in
our
brief,
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case,
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
position
that
that
case
really
only
refer
to
the
rights
of
charging
parties
in
the
district
court,
and
therefore
was
not
apposite
or
helpful
to
them
in
determining
whether
or
not
we
would
have
standing
to
appeal
and
have
any
rights
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
and
finally,
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
statutory
language
that
charging
parties
shall
be
represented
by
counsel
and
present
relevant
testimony
means
that
and
no
more.
now,
with
respect
to
the
last,
perhaps
first,
whether
the
language
means
that
and
no
more,
we
would
then
turn
to
the
first,
what
part
of
our
argument,
and
we
would
say
that
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
fact
that
charging
parties,
the
same
party
who
is
before
the
district
court
in
the
10
(l)
proceeding
also
proceeds
in
the
case
before
the
board.
and
in
that
board
case,
it
is
true
that
the
charging
party
is
referred
to
as
a
party,
but
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
this
court
had
held
in
scofield,
the
court
looks
to
the
overall
concern
and
the
overall
concern
in
this
act
is
the
protection
of
charging
party
rights.
and
particularly
here,
there
is
even
a
stronger
protection
with
respect
to
the
neutral
in
an
8
(b)
(4)
situation
where
there
is
a
mandatory
requirement
to
seek
relief.
but
in
the
board
proceeding,
the
charging
party
participates
at
all
levels
in
the
investigation,
in
the
issuance
of
complaint,
in
settlement,
in
hearings,
appeals
and
so
forth.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
we
would
contend
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
that
--
we
would
definitely
--
our
position
is
that
our
rights
only
vest
after
the
regional
director
has
made
his
determination.
and
should
he
change
his
mind
and
there
is
a
possibility
that
in
a
particular
kind
of
situation,
he
might
change
his
mind.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
no.
i
would
say
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
one
of
the
board's
principle
arguments
is
that
very
fact
that
the
statute
is
silent.
we
would
answer
that
in
three
ways.
first,
that
that
scheme
of
the
act,
in
other
words,
since
the
charging
parties
have
these
rights
in
the
board
case,
they
also
have
these
rights
in
the
district
court
case.
and
then,
we
have
cited
this
court
to
the
only
case
that
we
have
unable
to
find
on
the
--
trying
to
define
on
appeal
the
--
justice
marshall's
decision
in
the
marbury
versus
madison,
and
we
would
contend
that
an
appeal
by
its
very
nature
is
not
the
institution
of
a
new
cause
and
is
simply
to
correct
of
that
which
was
done
below.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
if
the
--
your
honor,
if
the
regional
director
took
that
position,
we
would
take
--
we
would
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
--
it
is
still
for
the
charging
party
to
urge
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
correctness
of
the
director's
petition.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i
see.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well
this
--
your
honor,
this
is
exactly
again
was
the
situation
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
and
in
that
situation,
the
charging
party,
the
regional
director
which
would
happen
fairly
frequently
in
this
board
cases
is
that
many
times,
the
union
and
the
director
will
seek
to
--
the
union
will
say
we'll
stop
picketing
while
we
resolve
the
underlying
dispute,
and
the
union
will
offer
a
stipulation.
and
there
are
times
such
as
in
the
amicus
case
here
in
the
terminal
freight
case
where
the
charging
party
will
object
to
that
stipulation.
that
is
one
situation
where
it
arises.
we
would
contend
that
the
charging
party
has
the
right
as
it
did
--
as
the
court
found
in
the
ninth
circuit
case
to
urge
to
the
court
that
there
is
fact
reasonable
cause.
since
the
director
found
reasonable
cause,
it
is
for
now
for
the
court
to
determine
and
the
court
is
not
simply
a
rubberstamp
with
respect
to
what
the
director
has
done.
the
court
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
and
it
must
make
up
its
mind
and
the
statute
10
(l)
gives
the
party
the
right
to
be
heard.
certainly,
it
gives
the
party
the
right
to
present
relevant
testimony.
we
would
say
that
that
right
to
present
testimony
does
not
mean
just
that
and
no
more,
because
that
would
not
be
a
logical
result.
it
--
apart
from
that,
it
has
work
otherwise.
example
again
in
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well
your
honor
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
there
was
--
if
i
could
--
i
will
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
i
would
contend
two
things
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
of
taft-hartley.
i
would
contend
first
that
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
discussed,
the
legislative
history
is
silent.
with
respect
to
specific
reference
to
these
words
in
the
statute,
the
charging
party
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
by
counsel
and
present
relevant
testimony.
now,
we
submit
that
first
so
far
as
that
silence
is
concerned
just
the
silence
alone.
that
silence
does
not
necessary
militate
against
us.
and
your
honors
in
the
two
decision
rendered
this
morning
and
i
was
familiar
with
one
because
i
had
kept
off
with
the
briefs,
particular
in
the
barlow
case
that
the
court
said
it
is
however
only
upon
a
showing
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
a
contrary
legislative
intent
that
the
court
should
restrict
access
to
judicial
review.
the
framers
of
taft-hartley,
i
think
we
have
to
look
--
in
view
of
the
silence
with
respect
to
the
specific
language,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
context
in
which
the
debates
occurred.
and
that
context
was
that
the
debates
on
taft-hartley
occurred
in
1948,
the
spring
1948.
pardon
me,
in
the
spring
of
---
yes,
in
the
spring
of
1948.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i'm
sorry,
the
spring
of
1947.
and
at
that
time,
the
debates
occurred
in
the
context
of
the
senate
being
concern
with
president
truman
again,
vetoing
in
measure,
and
it
was
in
the
80th
congress
this
debates
occurred.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
cited
the
court,
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
deliberations
that
occurred
in
the
79th
congress,
because
it
is
only
by
looking
to
that
background
that
we
see
the
light
in
which
the
court
was
--
the
congress
was
concerned
with
private
party
rights.
at
that
time,
two
things
were
clear.
it
was
clear
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
protecting
neutrals,
and
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
were
enacted.
it
was
also
clear
that
what
it
transpired
between
the
enactment
of
norris-laguardia
and
the
wagner
act
and
up
till
that
time
was
unsatisfactory
in
terms
of
getting
injunctive
protection
where
there
was
a
neutral
or
where
there
was
a
wrong
party.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley,
the
board
would
first
have
to
make
a
determination
on
the
merits
where
there
was
a
violation.
and
one
of
the
purposes
was
that
there
would
be
a
prior
determination
but
that
prior
determination
has
the
statute
finally
evolved
was
to
be
only
upon
decision
by
the
regional
director
where
there
was
a
violation.
but
in
the
79th
congress,
the
case
bill
passed
both
houses
and
that
bill
provided
that
private
parties
as
well
as
the
board
could
seek
injunctive
relief.
and
it
passed
both
houses
of
congress.
president
truman
vetoed
that
bill.
but
then
--
and
there
weren't
sufficient
votes
to
override
the
veto.
immediately
at
the
convening
of
the
80th
congress,
a
bill
almost
identical
to
the
case
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate,
which
is
bill
s.55,
and
it
was
on
that
bill
that
hearings
were
held
in
the
senate
labor
committee.
at
the
same
time
in
the
house,
there
was
a
bill
which
passed
identical
to
the
case
bill
again
giving
rights
to
private
parties.
it
became
clear
however
to
--
certainly
to
senator
taft
that
if
there
was
going
to
either
be
no
veto,
and
if
there
was
going
to
getting
legislation,
there
had
to
be
some
compromise,
and
time
was
of
the
essence
the
--
that
government
was
operating
the
minds
as
the
smith-connolly
act
was
going
to
expire
in
a
few
months,
and
senator
taft
was
the
one
who
is
to
compromiser,
and
the
evidence
of
his
compromise
specifically
with
respect
to
the
question
of
private
party
rights
and
private
party
rights
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
temporary
injunctions
comes
from
the
procedures.
s.55
as
i
say
was
in
the
senate
labor
committee.
out
of
that
committee
was
--
came
a
committee
report
and
a
new
bill.
the
new
bill
was
called
in
the
88th
congress
s.1126.
and
so
far
as
section
10
(l)
was
concerned
and
so
far
as
the
rights
of
charging
parties
are
concerned,
the
words
i
referred
to
they
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
s.1126,
and
subsequently
have
remained
unchanged
in
the
statute.
however,
when
it
was
reported
out
of
committee,
senator
taft,
senator
ball,
senator
o'daniel
and
one
other
senator,
all
indicated
that
they
would
reserve
the
right
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
again
introduce
once
more
an
amendment
to
permit
private
parties
to
institute
these
rights.
now,
why
was
this
concerned?
because
they
were
concerned
that
the
private
party
was
the
aggrieved
party.
the
private
party
was
the
one
who
should
be
protected
and
they
were
concerned
that
perhaps
the
board
wouldn't
afford
sufficient
protection.
when
and
although
senator
taft,
at
the
time
that
it
was
reported
out
of
committee,
still
favored
private
party
rights
shortly
when
the
debates
began
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
we've
cited
that
in
the
briefs,
he
changed
his
position,
and
the
schism
came
when
senator
ball
was
the
one
who
introduced
the
amendment
for
a
private
party
rights
again
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
senator
taft
at
that
point
said
that
he
could
not
go
forward.
he
would
offer
another
compromise,
and
that
the
--
if
the
act
was
to
be
passed,
it
would
have
to
be
passed
without
the
rights
of
private
party
seeking
that
relief.
and
therefore,
i
say
that
since
there
was
such
concern
with
the
rights
of
private
parties,
the
words
of
section
10
(l)
should
not
be
read
narrowly
as
the
board
suggests.
but
rather
they
should
be
given
broader
interpretation.
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
oh
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes.
i
would
say
the
conflict
--
i
would
say
the
conflict
arises
specifically
between
the
tenth
circuit
decision
here
holding
these
words
to
be
in
exactly
what
they
say,
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
retail
clerks
case.
the
ninth
circuit
--
well,
i
would
call
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
well,
there
is
--
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
this
and
i
didn't
cite
it
specifically.
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
that
i
think
has
most
bearing
on
this
subject
is
the
mcleod
versus
the
business
and
mechanics
conference
case,
i
believe
it
was
a
1961
case,
and
that
was
the
case
where
the
decision
was
written
by
judge
marshall
--
justice
marshall.
and
in
that
situation,
i
recited
the
case
briefly
for
another
proposition
with
respect
to
the
charging
party
taking
a
position
not
urge
by
the
board.
but
the
interesting
thing
about
that
case
is
that
the
charging
party
was
there
at
all.
i
mean
the
charging
party
in
that
proceeding
and
we
did
not
intervene.
the
charging
party
in
that
proceeding
was
there
as
a
party,
and
the
charging
party
argued
as
a
party
and
there
was
no
--
that
although
the
court
was
silent
with
respect
to
that
status,
perhaps
the
question
wasn't'
raised,
but
certainly
inferentially,
that
case
would
seem
to
go
along
with
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit,
although
ninth
circuit
came
much
later.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
another
interesting
factor
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
and
that
is
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
--
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
set
forth
certain
headings,
and
while
the
tenth
circuit
tries
to
distinguished
the
case
with
respect
to
saying
the
case
only
stands
for
the
proposition
that
--
it
is
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
whether
or
not
injunctive
relief
would
be
granted.
in
reality,
the
headings
that
i've
reference
to
it,
it
is
rather
unusual
to
see
specific
headings
said
to
an
opinion.
all
of
the
discussion
with
respect
to
charging
party
rights
is
in
heading
roman
numeral
ii,
and
it
is
an
uppercase,
and
it
says
to
whom
was
the
temporary
injunction
granted?
and
that's
at
351
f.2d
528.
we
have
cited
the
case,
but
not
made
specific
reference
to
that.
and
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
on
the
one
hand
discussing
the
charging
party
rights,
and
on
the
other
hand
discussing
the
question
of
its
own
authority
for
when
it
was
talking
about
its
own
authority.
the
heading
is
“allege
abuse
of
discretion”
and
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
board
they're
appealed
and
claim
that
the
court
had
abused
its
discretion
when
it
granted
the
injunction
because
the
board
orders
that
the
injunction
had
been
granted
to
the
charge
of
parties.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
scofield
case,
insofar
as
it
sheds
light
on
this
question.
i
think
the
general
concept
--
i
think
the
position
of
the
board
and
the
union
and
the
court
has
been
scofield
is
to
be
read
narrowly,
and
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
scofield
stands
more
than
just
for
the
proposition,
the
question
of
multiplicity
of
suits
that
occurred
in
that
context.
scofield
stands
for
the
proposition
that
it
recognizes
private
rights.
in
fact
for
the
concept
of
recognition
of
private
rights,
this
court
cited
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case
which
had
earlier
reached
a
same
conclusion
and
the
court
spoke
in
terms
general
fairness.
the
court
recognized
also
that
the
status
of
the
amicus
was
not
status
enough.
i
will
reserve
my
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerard
c.
smetana
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
should
first
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
union
counsel's
argument
that
unions
also
are
beneficiaries
under
section
10
(l).
they
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
an
8
(e)
situation
where
there's
a
hot
cargo
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
retail
clerks
case,
it
was
the
union
who
was
the
charging
party
and
it
was
the
union
who
was
seeking
to
appeal
and
so
that
the
unions
in
those
situations
as
well
an
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
situation
where
the
attempt
to
enforce
of
coercively
enforce
illegal
8
(d)
contract
and
also
in
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
construction
industry
jurisdictional
cases,
the
union
is
the
charging
party.
secondly,
so
far
as
the
cases
have
decided
the
appellate
review,
the
union
counsel
suggests
that
they
have
all
given
charging
party
only
amicus
status.
i
would
suggest,
your
honors
that
this
is
the
first
case
where
the
issue
has
a
reason
where
the
--
it
involves
a
charging
party
which
is
an
appellant.
and
there
is
considerable
difference
because
in
the
retail
clerks
case,
although
the
charging
party
was
relegated
to
amicus
status,
i'm
glad
that
i
have
to
refer
the
court
back
to
the
appendix,
to
our
reply
brief
on
the
--
an
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert.
that's
supplemental
appendix
a-43.
in
that
appendix,
that
appendix
reflects
the
fact
that
the
charging
party
which
was
only
granted
amicus
status
however
presented
oral
argument
and
presented
briefs
and
in
fact,
in
the
context
of
the
case
where
the
only
ones
to
present
that
position.
conversely,
in
our
situation
if
we
are
not
granted
party
status,
we
will
be
precluded
from
appealing
from
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief.
and
if
the
board's
argument
on
control
is
to
hold,
i
would
submit
the
board's
argument
control,
on
control
is
wholly
without
reason
primarily
because
the
board
is
suggesting
that
it
could
be
in
the
position
of
on
the
one
hand
having
found
reasonable
cause
what
was
mandatorily
required
to
proceed
with
the
act.
on
the
other
hand,
still
maintaining
their
reasonable
cause,
still
going
forth
with
the
underlying
case
but
suddenly
deciding
that
for
some
reason,
there
might
be
something
that
in
appealing
the
10
(l)
situation
might
interfere
with
its
ultimate
victory
in
the
underlying
case.
i
would
submit
that
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
their
fear,
fine!
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
will
and
then
the
board
perhaps
will
have
to
pull
out
of
the
underlying
case.
but
so
long
as
they
maintain
reasonable
cause,
so
long
as
they
don't
their
mind
about
the
underlying
case,
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
a
mandatory
obligation
to
go
forward
but
certainly,
they
have
--
they
cannot
take
the
position
that
they
must
have
control.
they
have
the
control.
they
can
change
their
mind
on
reasonable
cause
that
is
the
only
kind
of
control.
and
i
would
submit
in
analyzing
the
question
of
control,
we
must
look
to
the
kind
of
control
the
board
has
urged
even
in
the
court
below.
the
board
--
the
board
would
say
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
said,
the
language
of
10
(l)
means
that
and
no
more
but
conversely,
again
looking
at
the
scheme
of
the
act,
the
board
in
charging,
in
charge
cases,
the
charging
party
has
many
rights
that
interfere
with
the
board's
control.
the
board
for
example
cannot
withdraw
its
complaint
in
the
board
case
once
having
gone
to
hearing
without
giving
the
charging
party
rights.
the
board
cannot
settle
the
board
case
once
having
gone
to
complaint
without
the
charging
party
being
heard.
i
think
these
are
the
kind
and
i'm
saying
that
that
scheme
of
the
act
is
also
transposed
to
the
language
of
being
heard
being
the
fact
that
it's
the
same
charging
party.
i
would
further
argue
the
answer
to
the
norris-la
guardia
argument.
mr.
manoli
gave
us
a
number
of
quotes
both
on
argument
and
from
his
brief
with
respect
to
the
fears.
well,
the
persons
who
are
enunciating
the
fears
at
that
time,
they
were
enunciating
the
fears
that
the
passage
of
taft-hartley
would
return
us
to
norris-la
guardia
and
the
very
fear
that
they
were
concerned
about
was
the
fear
that
anyone
be
at
the
board
or
private
parties
would
seek
injunctive
relief
before
the
merits
were
decided
and
i
would
submit
that
the
congress
acted
very
wisely
in
giving
the
--
in
entrusting
the
board
with
their
responsibility
of
seeking
that
relief.
because
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
9,
footnote
6
--
footnote
3,
pardon
me,
the
board's
record
is
excellent
taking
1967
as
a
typical
year
and
the
only
reason
we
took
1967
was
because
we
wanted
to
see
what
happened
to
all
those
10
(l)
cases
where
the
board
went
to
final
order.
there
was
69
cases
in
that
year.
there
were
many
other
10
(l)
they
had
issued
on
165
and
they
were
almost
1500,
1800
charges
under
these
sections.
but
the
significant
fact
is
that
in
those
cases
where
they
went
to
final
order
where
injunctive
relief
was
either
granted
or
denied,
and
the
ultimate
board
litigation
only
one
case
was
their
cause
to
find
that
the
regional
director's
original
cause,
original
basis
for
reasonable
cause
was
an
error.
so,
i
would
submit
that
the
board
is
wise
that
the
persons,
the
charged
party
has
not
generally
been
disadvantaged
in
terms
of
the
regional
director
not
being
sustained
in
his
finding
of
reasonable
cause.
and
i
would
--
i
submit,
the
finding
of
reasonable
cause
is
the
central
issue
and
so
long
as
the
regional
director
maintains
that
reasonable
cause,
he
cannot
say
that
he
does
not
have
control
because
that
is
the
element
of
control.
simply
so
far
as
the
henderson
case
which
counsels
of
both
side,
and
i
would
say
is
not
very
convincing.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
retail
clerks
case
went
to
a
great
length
to
try
to
analyze
the
question.
the
henderson
case
was
simply
a
summary
discussion
and
really
only
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
amicus
or
intervention
status
at
the
appellate
level
and
that
is
inconsistent,
first
of
all
with
the
retail
clerks
case
with
respect
to
that
question.
and
i
would
submit
that
there
is
however
a
more
fundamental
question
when
we
are
appellants.
because
in
order
to
appeal,
we
must
be
considered
a
party
and
as
i
have
said,
a
party
minus
the
right
to
seek,
a
party
minus
the
right
to
urge
other
positions
not
consistent
with
the
original
position
and
perhaps
as
moore
suggest,
perhaps
there
is
some
third
animal
in
the
law
which
could
come
out
in
this
case.
something
less
--
something
less
than
a
full
party
because
we
can't
do
all
those
other
things
but
yet
someone
having
the
rights
of
a
party
and
someone
who
has
--
where
the
rights
of
the
amicus
are
not
sufficient
as
the
court
has
said
in
schofield.
thank
you.
