mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
has
indicated,
petitioner
makes
what
is
basically
a
three-problem
attack
on
our
views
conviction
for
non
registration
with
selected
service
system.
he
says
first
that
the
statute
of
limitation
is
barred
in
the
instant
the
prosecution.
he
says
second
that
if
it
did
not
have
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
provides
a
complete
defense
to
his
conviction.
and
he
says
third,
that
in
all
events,
his
religious
beliefs
provide
him
defense
since
can
tell
the
conviction
that
he
should
not
even
submit
to
registration
or
that
the
list,
the
court
should
have
submitted
that
issue
to
the
jury.
i
think
the
central
fallacy
of
the
statute
of
limitations
argument
was
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
white.
the
result
as
we
see
it
if
the
petitioner
is
correct
is
that
at
age
23,
when
he
says
the
five-year
statute
of
limitations
would
have
run,
he
will
no
longer
be
subject
to
registration
and
i
don’t
see
anything
that
makes
him
subject
to
registration.
part
of
criminal
prosecution
for
failure
to
register
at
the
time
he
should
have.
on
our
view
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation
that
we
think
properly
implements
the
statute
is
simply
this.
when
the
district
court,
i
think
set
it
up
perhaps
as
well
as
it
could
be.
basically,
the
offense
that
petitioner
is
charged
with
is
one
of
failing
the
register
with
the
selective
service
system
not
simply
upon
reaching
age
18
when
he
is
required
to
but
failing
to
register
it
all
during
a
period
of
time
between
age
18
and
age
26
during
which
the
regulation
and
we
think
by
fair
application
to
statutes
that
the
regulation
sought
to
implement
and
effectuate
require
that
he
performs
his
duty.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
the
--.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
the
registration
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
registration
statute
itself
section
453
says
that
every
male
person
now
here
at
the
united
states
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
from
page
2
of
our
brief
with
subsection
3
of
the
statute.
who
on
the
day
or
days
fix
for
the
first
or
any
subsequent
registration
is
between
the
ages
of
18
and
26
and
it
goes
on
to
say
shall
register
set
up
by
proclamation
in
the
rules
and
regulations.
now
in
section
4
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
that,
your
honor
but
the
way
we
read
it
is
that
reading
it
in
pari
materia
with
section
4
which
makes
people
between
18-1/2
and
26
liable
for
training
service.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
set
out
a
group
of
people
in
this
age
group
who
are
responsible
for
registration.
there
are
certain
people
who
are
not
required
to
register
initially
at
age
18.
they
become
responsible
for
registration
upon
the
happening
of
certain
events
that
no
longer
put
them
in
this
exempt
category.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
there’s
a
whole
list
that’s
provided
by
section
454
and
it’s
set
out
in
the
regulations
that
people
are
essentially
are
in
the
armed
forces
at
that
time
of
people
will
reserve
components,
people
serving
a
certain
government
capacity
things
like
that
and
aliens
and
certain
kind.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
had
no
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
i
don’t
think
it
says
male
citizens,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
says
male
person,
now,
here
at
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
and
there’s
a
rather
intricate
provision
relating
to
aliens
basically
on
my
understanding
is
the
most
aliens
are
required
to
register
if
they
are
determined
not
to
register
and
subject
themselves
to
service.
they
still
be
it
may
be
admitted
in
certain
categories
but
they
forfeit
the
right
to
become
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we
think
it’s
both
a
continuing
duty
that
the
regulation
prescribes
that
quite
clearly.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
that’s
one
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
offense
continued
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
from
five
days
thereafter.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
offense
continues
because
the
statute
and
regulation
that
implement
that
statute
requires
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
difference
here
is
this
individual
had
a
responsibility
at
age
18
or
five
days
thereafter
to
register.
he
did
not
do
that
and
he
has
continued
thereafter
not
to
do
that.
the
notion
of
the
continuing
offense
is
this
court
decisions
is
spelled
out
and
because
our
brief
develops
fits
with
this.
basically,
the
notion
is
that
there
is
an
ultimate
objective
that
the
individuals
criminal
activity
seeks
to
achieve
the
ultimate
objective
here
is
evasion
of
military
service.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
that
cannot
be
achieved
unless
until
he
reaches
the
point
in
time
at
age
26
when
he
is
no
longer
liable
for
training
and
service.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
if
he
came
in
and
registered
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
he
enlisted
in
the
army,
just
decided.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
the
chances
of
the
government
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
technically
correct,
your
honor
but
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
one
element
of
this
offense
is
willfulness
and
coming
in
at
any
time,
it
seems
to
me
the
more
remote
obviously
that
the
less
significant
this
is
but
coming
in
certainly
10
days
after,
would
seem
to
me
that
to
raise
serious
doubt
about
the
willfulness
of
his
earlier
violation
and
i
doubt
that
he
would
be
prosecuted.
the
only
difficulty
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
would
have
as
was
somebody
who
had
apparently
pursued
a
deliberate
course
of
non-registration
until
he
had
reached
that
of
situation,
marriage-wise
or
otherwise
where
he
was
eligible
for
deferment
on
an
exemption
and
then
he
came
in
and
said,
well,
here
i
am
and
i
just
want
to
tell
you,
i
want
to
register
and
i
didn’t
mean
anything
bad
by
what
i
did
previously.
otherwise,
the
government’s
policy
is
basically
to
get
man
to
serve
in
the
military
and
not
what
people
in
prison.
now
petitioner
first
to
hawaii
case
on
which
he
says
it
demonstrates
conclusively
that’s
not
the
government’s
policy.
i
like
simply
to
say
that
as
to
the
hawaii
case,
the
individual
very
carefully
came
in
only
after
it
reach
age
26
and
it
seems
to
me
that’s
a
sufficient
answer
to
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
split.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
considered
this
regarding
the
requirement
as
a
continuing
duty
and
of
regard
of
the
offense
as
a
continuous
offense.
now
it
is
true
that
several
of
these
cases
have
intimated
that
the
duty
is
an
open-ended
one
and
does
not
terminate
at
age
26.
this
question
was
raise
as
mr.
justice
brennan
brought
up
in
this
very
case.
just
his
brother
was
charged
along
with
him.
his
brother
at
the
time
he
was
charged
was
age
33
or
two
years,
close
to
two
years
beyond
the
age
of
31
when
we
say
there’s
the
statue
of
limitations
and
the
courts
below
say
the
statute
of
limitations
ground
as
failure
to
register.
the
judge
dooling
determined
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
putting
all
together,
section
3,
section
4
and
the
regulations
that
seek
to
implement
them,
indicate
that
the
intended
congress
was
to
make
persons
eligible
for
service
in
the
armed
forces
responsible
to
register
until
they
reach
that
age,
age
26
when
they
were
no
longer
liable
for
training
and
service.
now
we
think
that’s
a
reasonable
reason.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you
are
correct
and
i
thought
that
i
included
that
in
my
answer.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
thought
his
question
went
to
whether
there
was
a
split
on
the
continuing
duty
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don’t,
we
don’t
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don’t
and
i
thought
i
put
that
my
answer.
we
understand
this
case
is
to
leave
this
as
i
said
open-ended.
we
think
that
that’s
wrong
in
this
particular
case
as
solicitor
general
determine
in
the
case
of
his
brother
not
to
pursue
on
appeal
simply
because
we
thought
that
was
not
an
appropriate
or
proper
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct
except
that
i
don’t
agree
and
i
don’t
accept
the
notion
of
the
13-year
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
our
notion
is
that
a
five-year
statute
is
being
applied.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
there
are
some
reasons
for
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
decisions,
these
earlier
decisions
that
we
are
referring
to
were
in
the
main
decided
ten
or
more
years
ago
since
that
time
there’s
been
a
substantial
development
evolution
in
the
fifth
amendment
area.
the
fifth
amendment
issues
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
things
considered,
this
was
a
reasonable
construction
and
application
of
the
statute
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
problems
before
you
reach
that
day,
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
problems
throughout.
you
think
that
they’re
answers
to
them
but
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
the
annual
obligation
in
january?
i
don’t
see
any
essential
difference,
your
honor.
it
is
more
likely
annual
income
tax
return
or
the
renewal
of
a
driver’s
license,
various
analogies
and
we
suggested.
it
seems
to
us
that
and
this
is
anticipating
a
bit
of
privilege
argument.
it
seems
to
us
that
no
matter
how
petitioner
seeks
to
characterize
it.
his
argument
ultimately
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
once
a
person
violates
either
continuing
or
recurring
obligation
or
duty
imposed
by
the
government
whether
it
be
a
regulatory
scheme,
a
tax
scheme,
or
whatever,
a
scheme
that
requires
registration
reporting.
the
thrust
of
his
argument
is
that
once
he
violates
that,
statute
limitations
on
that
offense
starts
to
run
and
that
thereafter
he’s
insolated
from
any
further
compliance
because
he
can
say
at
any
further
compliance
would
incriminate
beyond
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
can't
be
required
to
do
that.
now,
we
think
that
none
of
this
case
is
marchetti,
grosso,
or
any
of
the
others
go
to
this
extreme.
now
petitioner
seek
to
draw
some
distinctions
and
says
he
doesn’t
he
really
mean
to
go
that
far
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
that
he’s
not
going
that
far.
the
central
objective
it
seems
to
us
of
the
point
that
he
seeks
to
make
is
on
the
privilege
question
is
that
he
could
not
be
compelled,
require
or
whatever
to
register
after
the
initial
registration
period.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
that
is
so,
neither
could
people
be
required
to
make
reports,
returns
or
whatever
after
they
had
initially
fail
to
comply
with
the
requirement.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
in
some
sense
he
incriminates
himself
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there’s
a
substantial
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
certainly
does
have
a
basis
prosecuting.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
several
ways
to
getting
over.
the
first
place
as
i
indicated
his
coming
in
voluntary
cast
the
question
initially
on
the
willfulness
of
the
original
offense
on
whether
the
prosecution
would
be
successful.
and
also
it
seems
to
us
and
this
is
i
think
the
central
point
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
rely
is
that
there
isn’t
any
real
compulsion
that’s
working
on
him
to
force
him
to
come
in
after
he
first
fail
to
register.
this
is
a
continuing
offense
we
accept
that
and
we
have
to
accept
that
proposition
in
order
to
get
to
the
privilege
question.
therefore
unlike
the
situations
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
he
risks
no
greater
thread
of
punishment
by
continuing
not
to
register
during
the
period
required.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
i
think
there’s
no
compulsion
working
on
him
and
therefore
no
violation
to
privilege.
this
is
developed
at
considerable
length
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
this
kind
of
situation.
the
situation
in
grosso
and
marchetti
situation
there
would
have
required
people
to
continue
to
do
things
and
would
have
continued
to
-
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
didn’t
suggest
that
in
the
first
place,
this
individual
didn’t
come
in
and
they
didn’t
clear
as
intent
that
it
wasn’t
ever
going
to
come.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
he
has
already
committed
whatever
offense
he
is
going
to
commit
since
it’s
a
continuing
offense,
it’s
a
continuing
crime
and
that
he
doesn’t
incriminate
himself
to
any
greater
extent
and
has
already
incriminate
him
so
there’s
one
continuous
offense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it’s
a
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
there’s
no
real
compulsion
working
on
him
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense
because
he
doesn’t
risk
anything
greater
by
not
coming
in
to
register.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
suggestion
was
that
this
was
incrimination
and
i
was
accepting
that
for
purposes
of
the
discretion.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
is
he
on
t
i
think
that--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
he
has
already
committed
the
criminal
offense
and
he
continuous
to
commit
one
by
not
coming
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
my
submission
was
that
the
compulsion
that
was
operating
on
him
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
was
not
the
sort
of
compulsion
that
should
be
given
sanction
by
this
court.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
essentially
the
point
we’re
making.
i
don’t
think
that
the
situation
is,
we
don’t
rest
simply
on
that
point
and
i
don’t
think
that
we
need
to
rest
on
that
point.
we’ve
developed
in
our
brief,
variety
of
other
suggestions
that
go
to
that
one
of
the
question
of
willfulness.
also
the
question
of
whether
the
government
in
fact
is
going
to
prosecute.
this
kind
of
position
that
we’re
going
to
take
as
i
indicated
earlier
and
will
take
is
that
if
this
people,
when
they
come
in,
they
have
not
sought
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
they
are
not
registering
at
some
earlier
point
although
they
may
have
committed
the
technical
violation,
the
purpose
is
to
get
people
eligible
for
military
service
and
not
into
jail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
and
i
don’t
suggest
that.
i
don’t
think
that
an
immunity
statute
this
petitioner
suggest
is
a
solution
to
this
problem
would
really
solve
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
simply
invite
people
to
fail
to
register
until
they
reach
the
point
in
time
when
they
were
in
a
better
situation
vis-à-vis
the
selective
service
system
and
then
coming
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
statute
of
limitations
begun
to
run
at
that
point
in
time,
then
the
statute
has
expired
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
then
the
statute
has
run
on
this
particular
offense
and
he
can't
be
prosecuted
and
the
courts
below
were
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
but
in
order
to
get
him
within,
the
period
of
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
here
under
our
view
never
started
to
run
because
he
was
indicted
just
prior
to
reaching
age
26.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
indictment
was
found
before
his
26th
birthday
so
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute
and
regulation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
could
be
indicted
as
in
any
continuing
offense.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
anomalous
about
that
counsel.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
counsel
suggested
that
there
was
something
strange
about
the
notion
that
at
age
19
as
so
the
government
discovered
this
and
prosecute
him,
this
is
so
with
respect
to
conspiracy
and
any
other
continuing
offense,
if
it
continuous
the
government
can
certainly
interrupt
its
continuants
when
it
discovers
the
offense
and
bring
the
prosecution
against
the
individual
at
that
time.
it
doesn’t
have
to
wait
until
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct
and
i
think
any
suggestion
that
there
are
any
double
jeopardy
problems
here
is
answered
by
our
reference
to
the
regulation.
these
people
if
they’re
prosecuted
are
involuntarily
registered
with
the
selective
service
system
so
there’s
no
question
of
their
being
subjected
twice
to
jeopardy
for
non-registration.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
at
that
point.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
simply
whether
it
interferes
with
the
operations
to
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
question
is
also
whether
it
interferes
with
the
operations
with
the
selective
service
system
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
and
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
people
between
ages
18-1/2
and
26
are
liable
for
training
and
service.
now,
if
--
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
the
counsel’s
submission
is
correct,
petitioner
upon
reaching
age
23
and
five
days
would
no
longer
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution
and
i
can't
understand
why
that
point
it
would
be
simply
be
scot-free
although
it
would
still
be
with
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
then
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don’t
know
whether
it
could
or
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
under
our
submission
that
the
responsibility
to
register
of
terminates
at
age
26.
i
have
to
agree
and
therefore
he
could
not
commit
an
offense
after
that
and
the
statute.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
statute
would
grant
it
at
the
time.
the
several
other
comments
on
the
privilege
of
defense
that
the
petitioner
search
as
i
sought
to
allude
to,
there’s
some
question
whether
he
even
asked
standing
interest
to
assert
that
defense,
he
has
made
it
clear
indeed
and
his
point
three
years
made
it
demonstrably
plain
that
he
never
intended
to
register
at
all.
indeed
he
says
that
his
religious
beliefs
prevented
him
to
doing
so.
so
it
seems
to
us
there’s
some
real
question
about
whether
he
is
in
a
position
to
say
that
he
was
deterred
from
registering
at
some
later
point
in
time
because
of
potential
self-
incrimination.
the
marchetti
and
grosso
line
up
decisions,
we
sought
in
our
brief
to
distinguish
those,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
distinctions
are
rather
clear.
first,
they
relate
to
initial
registration
and
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
statutes
relating
people
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
petitioner
as
counsel
suggests
that
he’s
in
that
same
category
once
he
has
failed
initially
to
register.
we
don’t
think
that
as
long
as
it
is
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
have
responsibility
to
register
later
point
in
time
and
there
are
also
people
who
for
one
reason
or
another
have
excusably
failed
to
register
and
may
come
in
at
later
point
in
time.
they
indicated
that
the
chief
justice,
we
view
the
position
here
suggested
whatever
distinctions
might
sought
to
be
made
and
basically
a
far
reaching
one
as
the
court
accepts
it
on
the
privilege
question
that
will
take
it
beyond
anything
that
it’s
done
thus
far
in
the
fifth
amendment
area
and
that
we
think
will
seriously
impair
the
ability
of
the
government
to
obtain
necessary
information.
this
is
a
big
country
and
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
several
opinions
grosso
and
marchetti,
indeed
also
pointed
this
out
the
government’s
need
for
people
to
come
forward
with
information
as
in
essential
pre
requisite
to
effective
and
orderly
operation
of
a
variety
of
schemes.
we
can
suggest
the
number
of
analogies.
i
suggest
that
some
of
them
to
the
chief
justice.
on
the
last
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
doesn’t
really
require
despite
the
rather
elaborate
development
by
petitioner
very
much
come
in.
this
court
has
continually
recognized
that
congress
has
preceded
and
a
reasonable
and
sensible
fashion
in
establishing
procedures
for
determining
conscientious
objection
and
the
exemption
from
military
service
on
the
basis
of
that
objection.
it
seems
to
us
that
all
of
these
cases
nugent,
seeger,
the
case
is
at
presently
before
the
court
all
indicate
that
the
procedure
that
has
been
established,
there’s
a
reasonable,
sensible
sound
one.
we
don’t
know
of
any
case
that
stands
for
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
that
the
first
amendment
of
itself
requires
that
conscientious
objectors
be
taken
into
account.
unfortunately,
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
force
this
court
to
that
issue
because
congress
has
taken
into
account
conscientious
objection.
it
goes
back
as
petitioner
indicated
historically
even
to
colonial
time.
but
the
question
comes
down
simply
to
a
very
narrow
one
here.
is
the
burden
assuming
that
some
first
amendment
rights
exist
is
the
burden
to
come
in
and
register
and
do
nothing
more.
come
in
and
register
and
submit
to
a
readily
available,
sensible
reasonable
process
for
the
determining
conscientious
objection.
is
that
burden
such
a
great
one
that
it
should
be
given
constitutional
protection?
we
submit
that
it’s
not
that
as
a
sensible
scheme
to
have
all
people
come
in
and
identify
themselves
initially
with
the
government
so
that
the
selective
service
system
can
have
available
to
read
records
including
the
entirety
of
the
manpower
pool
available
and
then
there’s
a
procedure
going
on
from
there
to
determine
conscientious
objection.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
an
anonymous
tip.
that’s
all
that
the
record
shows,
a
tip
that
this
individual
and
his
brother
had
not
registered.
now
whether
somebody
got
mad
at
them
and
called
the,
i
don’t
know.
that’s
all
that
the
record
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
that
was
presented
and
indictments
were
found
and
the
prosecution
proceeded.
the
prosecution
as
just
his
brother
was
dismissed
because
of
judge
doing;
the
reading
of
the
statute
but
the
prosecution
has
the
petitioner
continued.
for
these
reasons--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
has
not
been
sentenced
yet
under
4208,
the
procedure
for
referral
and
determination
by
the
department
of
justice
as
to
inappropriate
sentencer.
there
are
questions
that
were
raised
during
the
course
of
trial
relating
to
his
mental
capacity
and
i
think
that’s
part
of
the
problem
here
that
not
that
an
insanity
defense
was
presented
as
such
but
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
punishment
is
one
that
is
suitable
for
determination
under
the
procedure
of
making
investigation
first
and
according
to
the
district
judge.
so
there
has
been
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
he
was
not,
your
honor,
judge
dooling
considered
the
initial
motion
to
dismiss
but
judge
mishler
who
was
the
judge
that
try.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
upholding
petitioner’s
conviction
should
be
upheld,
we
submit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
a
minute
and
half,
i
just
like
to
make
two
points.
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
if
you
take
the
first
stage
group
that
registered
in
1951,
18
to
26
try
to
apply
the
court
of
appeal
second
circuit
reasoning
to
them.
the
man
who
then
was
19
years
old
had
a
statute
of
limitations
of
11
years.
the
man
who
is
25
years
though
at
that
time
had
a
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years
and
it
makes
no
sense
it
seems
to
us
to
say
that
there
is
anything
within
the
statute
that
makes
26
years
the
cut-off
date.
now,
with
respect
to
the
compulsion,
all
i
want
to
say
is
this
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
not
be
here
today,
he’d
be
out.
if
it
would
not
for
the
fact
that
the
government
held,
there
was
a
continuing
duty
for
him
to
register
and
it
is
idle
to
say,
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
makes
no
difference.
the
statute
would
definitely
have
run
against
them
but
the
government
cannot
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
as
we
indicate
it
in
the
brief.
if
he’s
under
a
duty
to
register
then
the
fifth
amendment
problem
become
extremely
acute.
if
he
was
under
a
duty
to
register
the
statute
and
limitations
has
run.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
has
indicated,
petitioner
makes
what
is
basically
a
three-problem
attack
on
our
views
conviction
for
non
registration
with
selected
service
system.
he
says
first
that
the
statute
of
limitation
is
barred
in
the
instant
the
prosecution.
he
says
second
that
if
it
did
not
have
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
provides
a
complete
defense
to
his
conviction.
and
he
says
third,
that
in
all
events,
his
religious
beliefs
provide
him
defense
since
can
tell
the
conviction
that
he
should
not
even
submit
to
registration
or
that
the
list,
the
court
should
have
submitted
that
issue
to
the
jury.
i
think
the
central
fallacy
of
the
statute
of
limitations
argument
was
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
white.
the
result
as
we
see
it
if
the
petitioner
is
correct
is
that
at
age
23,
when
he
says
the
five-year
statute
of
limitations
would
have
run,
he
will
no
longer
be
subject
to
registration
and
i
don’t
see
anything
that
makes
him
subject
to
registration.
part
of
criminal
prosecution
for
failure
to
register
at
the
time
he
should
have.
on
our
view
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation
that
we
think
properly
implements
the
statute
is
simply
this.
when
the
district
court,
i
think
set
it
up
perhaps
as
well
as
it
could
be.
basically,
the
offense
that
petitioner
is
charged
with
is
one
of
failing
the
register
with
the
selective
service
system
not
simply
upon
reaching
age
18
when
he
is
required
to
but
failing
to
register
it
all
during
a
period
of
time
between
age
18
and
age
26
during
which
the
regulation
and
we
think
by
fair
application
to
statutes
that
the
regulation
sought
to
implement
and
effectuate
require
that
he
performs
his
duty.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
your
honor,
the
--.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
the
registration
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
registration
statute
itself
section
453
says
that
every
male
person
now
here
at
the
united
states
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
from
page
2
of
our
brief
with
subsection
3
of
the
statute.
who
on
the
day
or
days
fix
for
the
first
or
any
subsequent
registration
is
between
the
ages
of
18
and
26
and
it
goes
on
to
say
shall
register
set
up
by
proclamation
in
the
rules
and
regulations.
now
in
section
4
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
that,
your
honor
but
the
way
we
read
it
is
that
reading
it
in
pari
materia
with
section
4
which
makes
people
between
18-1/2
and
26
liable
for
training
service.
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
set
out
a
group
of
people
in
this
age
group
who
are
responsible
for
registration.
there
are
certain
people
who
are
not
required
to
register
initially
at
age
18.
they
become
responsible
for
registration
upon
the
happening
of
certain
events
that
no
longer
put
them
in
this
exempt
category.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
there’s
a
whole
list
that’s
provided
by
section
454
and
it’s
set
out
in
the
regulations
that
people
are
essentially
are
in
the
armed
forces
at
that
time
of
people
will
reserve
components,
people
serving
a
certain
government
capacity
things
like
that
and
aliens
and
certain
kind.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
had
no
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
i
don’t
think
it
says
male
citizens,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
says
male
person,
now,
here
at
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
and
there’s
a
rather
intricate
provision
relating
to
aliens
basically
on
my
understanding
is
the
most
aliens
are
required
to
register
if
they
are
determined
not
to
register
and
subject
themselves
to
service.
they
still
be
it
may
be
admitted
in
certain
categories
but
they
forfeit
the
right
to
become
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
we
think
it’s
both
a
continuing
duty
that
the
regulation
prescribes
that
quite
clearly.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
that’s
one
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
offense
continued
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
from
five
days
thereafter.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
the
offense
continues
because
the
statute
and
regulation
that
implement
that
statute
requires
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
the
difference
here
is
this
individual
had
a
responsibility
at
age
18
or
five
days
thereafter
to
register.
he
did
not
do
that
and
he
has
continued
thereafter
not
to
do
that.
the
notion
of
the
continuing
offense
is
this
court
decisions
is
spelled
out
and
because
our
brief
develops
fits
with
this.
basically,
the
notion
is
that
there
is
an
ultimate
objective
that
the
individuals
criminal
activity
seeks
to
achieve
the
ultimate
objective
here
is
evasion
of
military
service.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
that
cannot
be
achieved
unless
until
he
reaches
the
point
in
time
at
age
26
when
he
is
no
longer
liable
for
training
and
service.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
if
he
came
in
and
registered
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
he
enlisted
in
the
army,
just
decided.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
the
chances
of
the
government
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
technically
correct,
your
honor
but
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
one
element
of
this
offense
is
willfulness
and
coming
in
at
any
time,
it
seems
to
me
the
more
remote
obviously
that
the
less
significant
this
is
but
coming
in
certainly
10
days
after,
would
seem
to
me
that
to
raise
serious
doubt
about
the
willfulness
of
his
earlier
violation
and
i
doubt
that
he
would
be
prosecuted.
the
only
difficulty
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
would
have
as
was
somebody
who
had
apparently
pursued
a
deliberate
course
of
non-registration
until
he
had
reached
that
of
situation,
marriage-wise
or
otherwise
where
he
was
eligible
for
deferment
on
an
exemption
and
then
he
came
in
and
said,
well,
here
i
am
and
i
just
want
to
tell
you,
i
want
to
register
and
i
didn’t
mean
anything
bad
by
what
i
did
previously.
otherwise,
the
government’s
policy
is
basically
to
get
man
to
serve
in
the
military
and
not
what
people
in
prison.
now
petitioner
first
to
hawaii
case
on
which
he
says
it
demonstrates
conclusively
that’s
not
the
government’s
policy.
i
like
simply
to
say
that
as
to
the
hawaii
case,
the
individual
very
carefully
came
in
only
after
it
reach
age
26
and
it
seems
to
me
that’s
a
sufficient
answer
to
it.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
split.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
considered
this
regarding
the
requirement
as
a
continuing
duty
and
of
regard
of
the
offense
as
a
continuous
offense.
now
it
is
true
that
several
of
these
cases
have
intimated
that
the
duty
is
an
open-ended
one
and
does
not
terminate
at
age
26.
this
question
was
raise
as
mr.
justice
brennan
brought
up
in
this
very
case.
just
his
brother
was
charged
along
with
him.
his
brother
at
the
time
he
was
charged
was
age
33
or
two
years,
close
to
two
years
beyond
the
age
of
31
when
we
say
there’s
the
statue
of
limitations
and
the
courts
below
say
the
statute
of
limitations
ground
as
failure
to
register.
the
judge
dooling
determined
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
putting
all
together,
section
3,
section
4
and
the
regulations
that
seek
to
implement
them,
indicate
that
the
intended
congress
was
to
make
persons
eligible
for
service
in
the
armed
forces
responsible
to
register
until
they
reach
that
age,
age
26
when
they
were
no
longer
liable
for
training
and
service.
now
we
think
that’s
a
reasonable
reason.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you
are
correct
and
i
thought
that
i
included
that
in
my
answer.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
thought
his
question
went
to
whether
there
was
a
split
on
the
continuing
duty
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we
don’t,
we
don’t
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
don’t
and
i
thought
i
put
that
my
answer.
we
understand
this
case
is
to
leave
this
as
i
said
open-ended.
we
think
that
that’s
wrong
in
this
particular
case
as
solicitor
general
determine
in
the
case
of
his
brother
not
to
pursue
on
appeal
simply
because
we
thought
that
was
not
an
appropriate
or
proper
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct
except
that
i
don’t
agree
and
i
don’t
accept
the
notion
of
the
13-year
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
our
notion
is
that
a
five-year
statute
is
being
applied.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
there
are
some
reasons
for
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
decisions,
these
earlier
decisions
that
we
are
referring
to
were
in
the
main
decided
ten
or
more
years
ago
since
that
time
there’s
been
a
substantial
development
evolution
in
the
fifth
amendment
area.
the
fifth
amendment
issues
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
things
considered,
this
was
a
reasonable
construction
and
application
of
the
statute
of
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
problems
before
you
reach
that
day,
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
problems
throughout.
you
think
that
they’re
answers
to
them
but
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
you
mean
the
annual
obligation
in
january?
i
don’t
see
any
essential
difference,
your
honor.
it
is
more
likely
annual
income
tax
return
or
the
renewal
of
a
driver’s
license,
various
analogies
and
we
suggested.
it
seems
to
us
that
and
this
is
anticipating
a
bit
of
privilege
argument.
it
seems
to
us
that
no
matter
how
petitioner
seeks
to
characterize
it.
his
argument
ultimately
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
once
a
person
violates
either
continuing
or
recurring
obligation
or
duty
imposed
by
the
government
whether
it
be
a
regulatory
scheme,
a
tax
scheme,
or
whatever,
a
scheme
that
requires
registration
reporting.
the
thrust
of
his
argument
is
that
once
he
violates
that,
statute
limitations
on
that
offense
starts
to
run
and
that
thereafter
he’s
insolated
from
any
further
compliance
because
he
can
say
at
any
further
compliance
would
incriminate
beyond
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
can't
be
required
to
do
that.
now,
we
think
that
none
of
this
case
is
marchetti,
grosso,
or
any
of
the
others
go
to
this
extreme.
now
petitioner
seek
to
draw
some
distinctions
and
says
he
doesn’t
he
really
mean
to
go
that
far
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
that
he’s
not
going
that
far.
the
central
objective
it
seems
to
us
of
the
point
that
he
seeks
to
make
is
on
the
privilege
question
is
that
he
could
not
be
compelled,
require
or
whatever
to
register
after
the
initial
registration
period.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
that
is
so,
neither
could
people
be
required
to
make
reports,
returns
or
whatever
after
they
had
initially
fail
to
comply
with
the
requirement.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
in
some
sense
he
incriminates
himself
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there’s
a
substantial
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
government
certainly
does
have
a
basis
prosecuting.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
several
ways
to
getting
over.
the
first
place
as
i
indicated
his
coming
in
voluntary
cast
the
question
initially
on
the
willfulness
of
the
original
offense
on
whether
the
prosecution
would
be
successful.
and
also
it
seems
to
us
and
this
is
i
think
the
central
point
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
rely
is
that
there
isn’t
any
real
compulsion
that’s
working
on
him
to
force
him
to
come
in
after
he
first
fail
to
register.
this
is
a
continuing
offense
we
accept
that
and
we
have
to
accept
that
proposition
in
order
to
get
to
the
privilege
question.
therefore
unlike
the
situations
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
he
risks
no
greater
thread
of
punishment
by
continuing
not
to
register
during
the
period
required.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
i
think
there’s
no
compulsion
working
on
him
and
therefore
no
violation
to
privilege.
this
is
developed
at
considerable
length
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
this
kind
of
situation.
the
situation
in
grosso
and
marchetti
situation
there
would
have
required
people
to
continue
to
do
things
and
would
have
continued
to
-
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
didn’t
suggest
that
in
the
first
place,
this
individual
didn’t
come
in
and
they
didn’t
clear
as
intent
that
it
wasn’t
ever
going
to
come.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
he
has
already
committed
whatever
offense
he
is
going
to
commit
since
it’s
a
continuing
offense,
it’s
a
continuing
crime
and
that
he
doesn’t
incriminate
himself
to
any
greater
extent
and
has
already
incriminate
him
so
there’s
one
continuous
offense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
it’s
a
question
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
there’s
no
real
compulsion
working
on
him
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense
because
he
doesn’t
risk
anything
greater
by
not
coming
in
to
register.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
brennan’s
suggestion
was
that
this
was
incrimination
and
i
was
accepting
that
for
purposes
of
the
discretion.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
is
he
on
t
i
think
that--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
he
has
already
committed
the
criminal
offense
and
he
continuous
to
commit
one
by
not
coming
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
my
submission
was
that
the
compulsion
that
was
operating
on
him
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
was
not
the
sort
of
compulsion
that
should
be
given
sanction
by
this
court.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
is
so,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
essentially
the
point
we’re
making.
i
don’t
think
that
the
situation
is,
we
don’t
rest
simply
on
that
point
and
i
don’t
think
that
we
need
to
rest
on
that
point.
we’ve
developed
in
our
brief,
variety
of
other
suggestions
that
go
to
that
one
of
the
question
of
willfulness.
also
the
question
of
whether
the
government
in
fact
is
going
to
prosecute.
this
kind
of
position
that
we’re
going
to
take
as
i
indicated
earlier
and
will
take
is
that
if
this
people,
when
they
come
in,
they
have
not
sought
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
they
are
not
registering
at
some
earlier
point
although
they
may
have
committed
the
technical
violation,
the
purpose
is
to
get
people
eligible
for
military
service
and
not
into
jail.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor
and
i
don’t
suggest
that.
i
don’t
think
that
an
immunity
statute
this
petitioner
suggest
is
a
solution
to
this
problem
would
really
solve
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
simply
invite
people
to
fail
to
register
until
they
reach
the
point
in
time
when
they
were
in
a
better
situation
vis-à-vis
the
selective
service
system
and
then
coming
in.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
the
statute
of
limitations
begun
to
run
at
that
point
in
time,
then
the
statute
has
expired
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
then
the
statute
has
run
on
this
particular
offense
and
he
can't
be
prosecuted
and
the
courts
below
were
in
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no
but
in
order
to
get
him
within,
the
period
of
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
here
under
our
view
never
started
to
run
because
he
was
indicted
just
prior
to
reaching
age
26.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
indictment
was
found
before
his
26th
birthday
so
that
under
our
view
of
the
statute
and
regulation.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
could
be
indicted
as
in
any
continuing
offense.
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
anomalous
about
that
counsel.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
counsel
suggested
that
there
was
something
strange
about
the
notion
that
at
age
19
as
so
the
government
discovered
this
and
prosecute
him,
this
is
so
with
respect
to
conspiracy
and
any
other
continuing
offense,
if
it
continuous
the
government
can
certainly
interrupt
its
continuants
when
it
discovers
the
offense
and
bring
the
prosecution
against
the
individual
at
that
time.
it
doesn’t
have
to
wait
until
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct
and
i
think
any
suggestion
that
there
are
any
double
jeopardy
problems
here
is
answered
by
our
reference
to
the
regulation.
these
people
if
they’re
prosecuted
are
involuntarily
registered
with
the
selective
service
system
so
there’s
no
question
of
their
being
subjected
twice
to
jeopardy
for
non-registration.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
at
that
point.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
is
not
simply
whether
it
interferes
with
the
operations
to
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
question
is
also
whether
it
interferes
with
the
operations
with
the
selective
service
system
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
and
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
people
between
ages
18-1/2
and
26
are
liable
for
training
and
service.
now,
if
--
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
the
counsel’s
submission
is
correct,
petitioner
upon
reaching
age
23
and
five
days
would
no
longer
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution
and
i
can't
understand
why
that
point
it
would
be
simply
be
scot-free
although
it
would
still
be
with
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
then
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don’t
know
whether
it
could
or
not.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
under
our
submission
that
the
responsibility
to
register
of
terminates
at
age
26.
i
have
to
agree
and
therefore
he
could
not
commit
an
offense
after
that
and
the
statute.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
statute
would
grant
it
at
the
time.
the
several
other
comments
on
the
privilege
of
defense
that
the
petitioner
search
as
i
sought
to
allude
to,
there’s
some
question
whether
he
even
asked
standing
interest
to
assert
that
defense,
he
has
made
it
clear
indeed
and
his
point
three
years
made
it
demonstrably
plain
that
he
never
intended
to
register
at
all.
indeed
he
says
that
his
religious
beliefs
prevented
him
to
doing
so.
so
it
seems
to
us
there’s
some
real
question
about
whether
he
is
in
a
position
to
say
that
he
was
deterred
from
registering
at
some
later
point
in
time
because
of
potential
self-
incrimination.
the
marchetti
and
grosso
line
up
decisions,
we
sought
in
our
brief
to
distinguish
those,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
distinctions
are
rather
clear.
first,
they
relate
to
initial
registration
and
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
statutes
relating
people
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
petitioner
as
counsel
suggests
that
he’s
in
that
same
category
once
he
has
failed
initially
to
register.
we
don’t
think
that
as
long
as
it
is
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
have
responsibility
to
register
later
point
in
time
and
there
are
also
people
who
for
one
reason
or
another
have
excusably
failed
to
register
and
may
come
in
at
later
point
in
time.
they
indicated
that
the
chief
justice,
we
view
the
position
here
suggested
whatever
distinctions
might
sought
to
be
made
and
basically
a
far
reaching
one
as
the
court
accepts
it
on
the
privilege
question
that
will
take
it
beyond
anything
that
it’s
done
thus
far
in
the
fifth
amendment
area
and
that
we
think
will
seriously
impair
the
ability
of
the
government
to
obtain
necessary
information.
this
is
a
big
country
and
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
several
opinions
grosso
and
marchetti,
indeed
also
pointed
this
out
the
government’s
need
for
people
to
come
forward
with
information
as
in
essential
pre
requisite
to
effective
and
orderly
operation
of
a
variety
of
schemes.
we
can
suggest
the
number
of
analogies.
i
suggest
that
some
of
them
to
the
chief
justice.
on
the
last
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
doesn’t
really
require
despite
the
rather
elaborate
development
by
petitioner
very
much
come
in.
this
court
has
continually
recognized
that
congress
has
preceded
and
a
reasonable
and
sensible
fashion
in
establishing
procedures
for
determining
conscientious
objection
and
the
exemption
from
military
service
on
the
basis
of
that
objection.
it
seems
to
us
that
all
of
these
cases
nugent,
seeger,
the
case
is
at
presently
before
the
court
all
indicate
that
the
procedure
that
has
been
established,
there’s
a
reasonable,
sensible
sound
one.
we
don’t
know
of
any
case
that
stands
for
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
that
the
first
amendment
of
itself
requires
that
conscientious
objectors
be
taken
into
account.
unfortunately,
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
force
this
court
to
that
issue
because
congress
has
taken
into
account
conscientious
objection.
it
goes
back
as
petitioner
indicated
historically
even
to
colonial
time.
but
the
question
comes
down
simply
to
a
very
narrow
one
here.
is
the
burden
assuming
that
some
first
amendment
rights
exist
is
the
burden
to
come
in
and
register
and
do
nothing
more.
come
in
and
register
and
submit
to
a
readily
available,
sensible
reasonable
process
for
the
determining
conscientious
objection.
is
that
burden
such
a
great
one
that
it
should
be
given
constitutional
protection?
we
submit
that
it’s
not
that
as
a
sensible
scheme
to
have
all
people
come
in
and
identify
themselves
initially
with
the
government
so
that
the
selective
service
system
can
have
available
to
read
records
including
the
entirety
of
the
manpower
pool
available
and
then
there’s
a
procedure
going
on
from
there
to
determine
conscientious
objection.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
an
anonymous
tip.
that’s
all
that
the
record
shows,
a
tip
that
this
individual
and
his
brother
had
not
registered.
now
whether
somebody
got
mad
at
them
and
called
the,
i
don’t
know.
that’s
all
that
the
record
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
that
was
presented
and
indictments
were
found
and
the
prosecution
proceeded.
the
prosecution
as
just
his
brother
was
dismissed
because
of
judge
doing;
the
reading
of
the
statute
but
the
prosecution
has
the
petitioner
continued.
for
these
reasons--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
has
not
been
sentenced
yet
under
4208,
the
procedure
for
referral
and
determination
by
the
department
of
justice
as
to
inappropriate
sentencer.
there
are
questions
that
were
raised
during
the
course
of
trial
relating
to
his
mental
capacity
and
i
think
that’s
part
of
the
problem
here
that
not
that
an
insanity
defense
was
presented
as
such
but
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
punishment
is
one
that
is
suitable
for
determination
under
the
procedure
of
making
investigation
first
and
according
to
the
district
judge.
so
there
has
been
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
he
was
not,
your
honor,
judge
dooling
considered
the
initial
motion
to
dismiss
but
judge
mishler
who
was
the
judge
that
try.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
upholding
petitioner’s
conviction
should
be
upheld,
we
submit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
a
minute
and
half,
i
just
like
to
make
two
points.
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
if
you
take
the
first
stage
group
that
registered
in
1951,
18
to
26
try
to
apply
the
court
of
appeal
second
circuit
reasoning
to
them.
the
man
who
then
was
19
years
old
had
a
statute
of
limitations
of
11
years.
the
man
who
is
25
years
though
at
that
time
had
a
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years
and
it
makes
no
sense
it
seems
to
us
to
say
that
there
is
anything
within
the
statute
that
makes
26
years
the
cut-off
date.
now,
with
respect
to
the
compulsion,
all
i
want
to
say
is
this
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
not
be
here
today,
he’d
be
out.
if
it
would
not
for
the
fact
that
the
government
held,
there
was
a
continuing
duty
for
him
to
register
and
it
is
idle
to
say,
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
makes
no
difference.
the
statute
would
definitely
have
run
against
them
but
the
government
cannot
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
as
we
indicate
it
in
the
brief.
if
he’s
under
a
duty
to
register
then
the
fifth
amendment
problem
become
extremely
acute.
if
he
was
under
a
duty
to
register
the
statute
and
limitations
has
run.
thank
you.
