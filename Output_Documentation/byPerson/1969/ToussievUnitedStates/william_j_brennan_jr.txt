justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
say
mr.
gurfein,
if
the
court
of
appeals
view
that
these
whole
things
are
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
itself
applies
only
between
age
of
18
and
26.
the
regulation
can’t
do
anymore.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
can’t
do
anymore
but
at
least
it
goes
five
years.
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
interpretation
when
you
suggested
that
someone
might
be
prosecuted
at
age
70
for
failing
to
register
52
two
years
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
fact
as
to
this
fellow’s
brother
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
dismissed
an
indictment
that
rather
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
was
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
saying,
now
you
have
to
read
this
really
as
--
since
the
statute
applies
only
between
ages
18
and
26.
well
then,
the
terminal
date
for
the
beginning
of
the
running
of
the
statute
on
occasions
which
we
concede
is
five
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rational.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
don’t
think
mr.
gurfein
that
the
statute
being
applicable
from
ages
18
to
26?
the
statute
itself
requires
one
to
register
at
some
time
between
18
and
26?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know.
no
but
if
the
statute
is
to
be
read
that
way,
then
why
up
to
age
26
isn’t
very
duty
to
register
and
not
having
registered?
why
wouldn’t
this
five-year
period
begin
to
run
at
age
26?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
when
is
that
completed?
when
it
applies
from
18
to
20?
is
it
completed
on
the
18th
birthday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
then
is
an
argument
mr.
gurfein
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
--
your
argument
then
is
that
the
crime
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitation,
it
was
completed
on
his
18th
birthday
when
he
failed
that
day
to
register.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
would
say
i
gather
that
when
he
came
--
he'd
be
23,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
further
more
he
had
no
duty
to
register
between
23
and
25.
justice
william
j.

jr.
what
