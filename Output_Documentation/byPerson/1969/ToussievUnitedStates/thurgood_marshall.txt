mr.
gurfein,
now
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
that
it’s
particularly
involved
in
this
case
but
suppose
they
just
ask,
let
me
see
your
draft
card,
what
will
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no.
i
mean
they
stopped
him
on
the
street.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
for
some
reason
asking
for
identification
and
say,
i
want
to
see
your
draft
card,
and
he
says
i
don’t
have
one.
he
could
be
prosecuted,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they’d
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
within
five
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
be
yours
if
that
would
still
be
a
five-year
limit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
beytagh,
i
could
understand
that
this
is
a
continuing
duty.
i
have
a
great
difficulty
with
being
the
continuing
effects
and
i’m
not
playing
semantic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
it’s
a
continuing
offense,
does
he
commit
it
365
times
a
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
day
he
was
18?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
that’s
when
the
offense
was
committed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
statutes
that
say,
you
shall
not
buy
heroin.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
to
buy
some
in
order
to
be
guilty
and
you’re
only
guilty
each
time
you
buy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
at
age
25
if
he
enlisted,
he
is
still
could
get
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
if
he
enlisted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
would
still
be
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
then
quite
--
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this,
what
is
it
26th
birthday?
he
has
a
choice
of
going
in
and
asked
him
to
register
and
expose
himself
to
fifth
amendment
problem
or
the
statute
were
right,
the
real
statute
of
limitation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn’t
that
give
you
some
fifth
amendment
problem
as
of
that
date?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
beytagh,
could
he
register
on
after
his
26th?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we’ll
how
do
you
submit
in
defense
after
age
26
if
he
could
register
if
it’s
a
continuing
offense.
