mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
born
in
1941
in
june.
he
became
18
on
june
23,
1959.
he
failed
to
register
for
the
draft,
the
reasons
of
conscience
and
was
indicted
after
an
arrest
in
february
of
1967,
almost
eight
years
after
his
initial
failure
to
register.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
he
took
no
steps
but
if
i
may,
your
honor
in
connection
with
my
argument
on
the
first
amendment,
i
shall
try
to
expand
that
a
little
further.
i'm
trying
to
make
a
summary
statement
of
facts
now
so
that
i
can
indicate
to
the
court
the
three
points
we
should
like
to
argue
within
the
short
space
of
time
allotted.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
the
first
statement
i
want
to
make
on
that
is
that
i
will
not
get
involve
at
this
time
in
the
reasons
why
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
a
sincerity
of
belief
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
he
could
not
take
part
in
the
registration
process
itself
because
his
was
a
pristine
religious
view
that
the
registration
process
itself
was
merely
an
extension
of
the
war
making
in
which
he
was
against.
it
should
be
recalled
that
in
1959
when
the
petitioner
willfully
failed
to
register,
there
was
no
war
going
on.
the
korean
war
had
been
finished.
there
was
no
vietnam
war
at
that
time.
as
i
say,
he
was
arrested
eight
years
after
the
event.
the
general
statute
of
limitations
as
we
know
is
a
five-year
statute
and
in
the
words
of
that
statute
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
adequate
and
proper
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
having
run
which
was
denied.
the
trial
was
held
and
at
the
trial
counsel
for
petitioner
requested
a
jury
charge
to
the
effect
that
if
the
jury
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
petitioner
and
that
his
failure
to
register
was
due
to
his
religious
conscience
that
they
should
acquit.
this
request
to
charge
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
a
conviction
by
the
jury
and
suit.
in
this
court
as
we
did
below,
we
make
three
points.
first,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
five-year
statute
and
that
any
extension
beyond
it
is
beyond
the
legislative
intention,
the
congressional
intention
and
indeed
the
prerogative
of
the
executive.
secondly,
we
say
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations
point
to
save.
it
is
only
save
thus
the
court
below
indicated
by
holding
that
a
regulation
and
not
a
statute
created
a
continuing
duty
to
register
and
that
by
just
the
possession
of
the
words,
the
continuing
duty
even
though
congress
said
nothing
about
a
continuing
offense,
ipso
facto
made
a
continuous
offense
as
if
congress
had
specifically
mandated
it.
and
if
that
be
the
construction
of
the
statute,
then
it
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
of
the
petitioner.
the
last
point
which
i
hope
we
shall
have
some
time
to
discuss
is
that
we
believe
that
under
the
first
amendment,
the
minimum
that
we
are
asking
here
is
covered
by
that
amendment
and
that
is,
that
when
a
religious
principle
objector,
objects
the
registration
as
part
of
the
process.
while
it
is
true,
he
must
subject
himself
to
the
criminal
process
at
the
same
time
he
has
a
right
when
he
is
tried
to
a
jury
to
have
an
instruction
that
if
the
jury
believes
he
is
religiously
sincere
that
they
should
recognize
in
the
context
of
this
whole
problem,
his
religious
conscience
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
i
may
turn
first
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
if
your
honors
please.
as
a
result
of
the
decision
below
by
the
distinguished
second
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
other
circuits,
we
are
now
in
the
state
of
law
that
a
narcotics
peddler
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
five
years.
a
man
who
sells
defense
secrets
to
a
foreign
government
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
ten
years.
the
boy
of
18
who
fails
to
register
for
selective
service
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
13
years
and
the
questions
is,
how
did
this
come
about
and
is
this
harsh
result
sound.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
in
this
face,
i'm
not
raising
a
constitutional
question,
your
honor,
except
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
black?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no.
i'm
raising
the
question
(a)
as
to
the
intention
of
congress
which
is
not
expressed
and
(b)
that
without
the
intention
of
congress,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
regulation
is
construed
as
i
have
indicated
it
was
below,
it
is
a
non-constitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power
by
the
congress
to
the
president
and
that
hence,
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers,
it
is
unconstitutional,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
correct.
i
need
to
spell
it
out
because
i
thought
it
was
obvious
but
what
the
court
did
below
in
order
to
get
around
this
problem
was
to
say
although
the
regulation
which
i
shall
read
in
a
minute,
perhaps
i’ll
read
it
now.
although
the
regulation
says
that
the
duty
the
register
shall
be
continuous
at
all
times,
two
circuits
have
construed
at
all
times
to
mean
for
life
apparently
because
there
are
two
circuits
that
seem
to
upheld
that
even
if
the
man
is
over
26,
rather
is
the
statute
goes
beyond
age
26,
he
can
still
be
prosecuted
which
would
make
a
man
of
70
subject
to
prosecution
and
this
court
had
a
collateral
problem
like
that
gara
which
was
affirmed
by
a
divided
court
four
to
four
in
1950.
but
it
was
a
collateral
case
so
we
really
don’t
know
what
the
court
held.
now
in
the
second
circuit,
they
held
that
the
regulation
merely
limited
to
26
and
therefore
it’s
obvious
that
a
boy
of
18
must
wait
till
26
which
is
eight
years
and
then
five
years
thereafter.
it’s
five
and
that’s
where
i
get
my
13
years
which
is
exactly
what
was
done
below
in
this
case.
now,
the
regulation,
i
don’t
think
means,
i
say
this
with
most
respect
designation,
what
it
has
been
construed
to
me
and
i
don’t
think
it
needs
much
of
a
gloss
as
to
what
was
intended.
at
page
813
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
the
regulation
says,
the
duty
of
every
person
subject
to
registration
to
present
himself
for
and
submit
to
registration
shall
continue
at
all
times
and
if
for
any
reason,
any
such
person
is
not
registered
on
the
day
or
one
of
the
days
fixed
his
registration.
he
should
immediately
present
himself
for
and
submit
to
registration
before
the
local
board
in
the
area
where
you
have
to
submit.
and
the
word
immediately,
the
very
peculiar
word,
if
you’re
talking
about
a
continuing
duty.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fair
entrance
of
this
is
that
in
issuing
the
regulations
under
the
statute
which
permitted
the
president
to
fix
the
time
with
times
and
place
of
place
of
registration
which
naturally
congress
had
to
do,
they
could
not
watch
everyday
the
registration.
but
all
these
means
is
that
if
a
man
was
sick
or
absent
from
the
country
or
out
of
town
or
something
else
happened
which
was
not
willful
that
he
should
not
believe
that
he
was
thereafter
forever
discharged
from
his
duty
because
at
age
18
he
could
not
register.
otherwise,
the
word
immediately
makes
very
little
sense.
and
i
say,
if
we
can
take
it
in
this
context,
your
honors,
you
have
a
very
simple
administrative
regulation
here
that
there’s
not
in
its
face
before
to
create
a
real
continuing
duty
and
certainly
on
its
face,
there’s
nothing
about
a
continuing
effects.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
well,
i
think
immediately
if
just
to
gloss
and
i
can’t
read
the
mind
of
congress
not
of
the
drafters
of
the
regulation,
mr.
the
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
to
catch
willful
offender
to
violate
the
law
that
beyond
the
pale.
i
think
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
notifying
people
for
a
perfectly
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
register
under
the
draft
law
to
a
simple
point
that
if
they
are
not
available
on
the
day
when
they
are
suppose
to
register,
that
they’re
suppose
to
register
thereafter.
now
when
it
says
immediately
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
same
result
should
follow
but
i
think
the
word
immediately
does
tend
to
help
us
in
construing
it
merely
as
an
administrative
regulation
and
not
as
the
courts
below
did
as
an
effect
and
substitution
for
a
statute
extending
the
general
statute
of
limitations
beyond
five
years.
now,
the
process
by
which
the
court
below
arrived
at
extending
statute
was
by
acknowledging
very
frankly
and
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
certainly
is
a
distinguished
opinion
in
terms
of
facing
the
problems
that
arose
and
let
me
decided
against
this,
we
said
we
cannot
complain
about
the
fairness
of
the
judicial
reasoning
that
led
to
the
result
and
they
recognize
all
the
problems
there.
that
court
did
not
as
the
government
now
contends
say
that
you
can
read
anything
into
that
statute.
they
honestly
said,
we
cannot
read
it
into
the
statute.
there
isn’t
any
such
thing
because
the
statute
of
limitation.
the
general
statute
just
accept
according
as
otherwise
provided
according
to
law.
assume
the
congress
can
make
a
13
years
statute
of
limitations
and
none
of
the
your
question
mr.
justice
black
if
it
chose
to
but
the
question
is,
did
it
choose
to?
what
is
there
in
this
statute
which
simply
says
that
the
president
may
say
when
a
boy
shall
come
in
and
register?
what
is
there
in
that
statute?
it
gives
the
executive
power
to
promulgate
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
recognize
as
in
practical
effect
and
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
now,
we
think
that
this
court
over
the
years
and
misquote
way
back
as
always
lean
over
backwards
if
i
may
use
the
colloquial
phrase
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitations.
it
runs
against
the
grain
of
lawyers
and
judges,
generally,
the
whole
system
of
criminal
justice
to
permit
by
extensions
by
back
way
or
back
doors
methods
by
ambiguities
the
creation
of
extensions
of
statutes
of
limitation
and
this
court
has
so
held
many
time.
now,
the
reason
for
it
is
perfectly
obvious
and
i
go
beyond
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
historical
material
that
we
put
into
the
brief.
your
honors,
we’ll
see
that
going
back
to
england
and
going
back
to
the
colonies
and
certainly
to
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
there
has
not
have
been
any
question
but
that
a
statute
of
limitations
must
be
created
by
the
legislature
and
not
by
the
executive.
and
it’s
one
of
those
fundamental
things
in
the
separation
of
powers
that
it
sees
to
me
has
gone
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
various
attempts
to
try
to
change
by
indirection
generally
at
the
instance
of
the
government
the
normal
rules
applicable
to
the
meaning
of
english
words
and
so.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
cannot
do
more.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
late
year
and
yet
on
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
right.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
judge
(inaudible)
did.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
point
i’m
making
is
a
very
simple
one
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
that
you
can
have
the
rulings
of
the
two
circuits
which
have
said
it
goes
for
all
time
as
against
the
ruling
of
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
we
say
they’re
both
wrong.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
--
is
age
26.
and
then
where
it
goes
to
age
31.
now
that
was
the
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
--
as
i
understand
the
gist
of
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
that
is
what
i
am
addressing
myself
to
now,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no,
it’s
right
on
line
with
my
thinking
if
i
may
suggest.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
when
you
have
a
continuing
duty
statute,
that
does
not
mean
that
you
have
a
continuing
offense
by
legislative
enactment.
i
go
back
to
an
old
case
in
this
court,
united
states
against
derwine
(ph)
which
goes
back
to
1870
or
something
of
that
kind.
in
that
case,
the
question
came
up
where
is
somebody
embezzled
funds
when
did
the
statute
begin
to
run.
it
had
been
held
below
that
since
he
had
a
duty
to
return
the
funds,
the
statute
had
not
run.
this
court
held
that
once
an
act
is
done
which
makes
it
a
completed
crime
then
the
statute
begins
to
run.
now,
congress
itself
knows
how
to
create
continuous
offenses
as
is
evidenced
for
example
by
the
bankruptcy
statute.
the
bankruptcy
statute
says
very
clearly
the
concealment
of
assets
of
a
bankrupt
or
other
debtor
shall
be
deemed
to
be
not
a
continuing
duty.
a
continuing
offense
until
the
debtor
shall
have
been
finally
discharged
or
discharged
denied
and
the
period
of
limitation
shall
not
begin
to
run
until
such
final
discharge
or
denial
of
discharge.
he
will
find
nothing,
your
honors.
in
the
selective
service
act,
which
remotely
relates
to
the
statute
of
limitations
or
even
to
the
creation
of
a
continuous
offense
and
so
we
say
analytically
as
well
as
historically
what
makes
it
necessary
to
say
if
we
are
to
adopt
the
liberal
construction
of
statutes
of
limitations
that
just
because
we
have
a
duty
that
that
necessarily
means
that
we
have
a
continuous
offense.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
there
maybe
a
duty
to
register
but
we
should
not
take
it
of
the
normal
concept
of
statutes
of
limitations
if
i
steal.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
because
under
normal
rules
of
statute
of
limitations
and
of
continuous
offenses,
i
believe
the
rule
is
and
should
be
that
once
the
crime
is
completed.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i’ll
put
it
to
you
this
way.
it
is
completed
in
this
sense
that
if
the
defendant
were
apprehended,
let
us
say
in
his
19th
birthday,
he
couldn’t
say
to
the
prosecutor,
now
wait
a
minute,
i
still
have
time
till
i’m
26.
he
is
in
the
toils.
he
has
committed
a
completed
crime
and
i
say,
your
honors,
that
if
he
has
committed
a
completed
crime,
what
is
there
to
say
by
virtue
of
legislative
mandate
that
that
is
to
be
treated
differently
from
any
other
(voice
overlap).
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
correct.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
in
five
days.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
the
statutory
obligation.
that’s
what
i
think
it
means.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
i
can’t
defend
myself
by
saying
no,
i
have
seven
more
years
or
five
years,
i’m
through.
i’m
a
criminal
and
i
think
it’s
right
to
the
second
point
because
of
the
time
and
let’s
take
it
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
would
say
that
when
he
became
to
be
23
he
could
not.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no,
i
say
he
may
have
a
duty
to
register
but
that
doesn’t
have
to
be
a
criminal
sanction.
there
are
many
duties
in
life
and
in
statutes
but
we
don’t
have
criminal
in
sanctions
that
happens
everyday.
now
if
i
steal
you
prize,
i
certainly
have
a
duty
to
return
it
to
you,
i
have
a
duty
for
life.
but
as
far
as
statute
limitations
is
concerned,
you
cannot
apprehend
me
more
than
five
years
after
i
still
stole
the
prize,
but
i
still
owe
you
the
prize
and
that’s
the
role
i
say
is
that
there's
been
a
gloss
upon
a
gloss
here.
in
the
first
place,
congress
never
said
so
and
congress
is
the
only
one
to
say
so.
second
place,
the
regulation
itself
is
an
ambiguous
and
in
the
third
place
by
every
rule
of
liberal
construction
and
criminal
cases,
the
rule
ought
to
be
and
we
think
is
that
the
statute
begin
to
run
when
the
crime
was
complete
and
the
test
of
when
the
crime
is
complete
this
could
the
man
have
been
apprehended
at
that
time
or
would
still
have
an
offense
and
that’s
our
position
on
that.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
the
only
analogy
is
in
the
alien
registration
acts
which
raise
the
same
problem
in
the
sense
and
where
there
has
been
some
different
view.
i
believe
that
they’ve
also
held
there
that
there’s
a
continuous
offense
but
i
think
the
policy
with
respect
to
aliens
is
a
separate
policy.
it
will
take
too
long
that
it
went
to
here
but
i
think
there
is
reserve
part
of
the
brilliant
and
which
make
it
different.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
you
mean
that
it
in
fact
everything?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
there
is
a
difficulty
but
so
is
there
a
difficulty
in
apprehending
a
thief
or
any
common
criminal.
and
i
don’t
think
that
these
lads
are
in
any
different
position
in
any
other
criminals
and
that’s
why
i
use
that
analogy,
may
have
seen
startling
or
perhaps
traumatic
but
the
fact
that
it
does
appeal
to
me
as
anomaly
that
a
narcotics
peddler
should
have
--
should
be
subject
to
five-year
term
of
limitations
and
i
believe
18
should
be
subject
to
13
years.
but
that
i
leave
because
my
time
is
running
on
that.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
true.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
true.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
the
limitation
is
only
for
that
reason
but
also
for
reasons
of
repose
as
the
courts
have
often
said.
now,
coming
to
the
second
point
and
i’m
sure
i
won't
have
time
for
the
third,
i
merely
downgrade
it,
your
honor,
i'm
saving
five
minutes
for
the
rebuttal.
the
--
once
you
say
that
the
only
reason
to
see
the
petitioner
here
is
in
trouble
is
because
you
extended
that
statute
of
limitations
because
he
had
a
compulsory
duty
to
register.
then
it
is
if
you
are
creating
two
statutes.
you
have
first
the
statute
which
makes
him
a
criminal
because
of
i
think
we
all
concede,
he
certainly
could
have
been
arrested
shortly
after
his
18th
birthday
if
he
willfully
fail
to
register.
and
then
you
say
to
him,
now
you
are
compelled
to
register
and
by
registering,
identify
yourself
with
your
name
and
age
and
birthday
and
by
that
very
identification,
you
are
submitting
yourself
to
prosecution
in
a
sense
of
whether
this
is
an
all
force
with
even
albertson
and
marchetti
in
spirit
and
theory.
it
is
an
even
more
pristine
violation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
because
here
you
do
have
an
act
which
can't
be
equivocal
really,
the
act
itself
of
registering
and
giving
your
name
and
birthday
is
enough
to
convict
you
so
we
don’t
have
talk
here
about
change
and
links
and
evidence
and
substantial
danger
of
incrimination.
now,
and
we
suggest
that
in
that
context
and
i
must
say
the
third
circuit
by
the
way
if
it
1955
before
this
whole
series
of
cases
indicated
that
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
alien
registration
cases
and
we’ve
cited
it
in
our
brief
there
might
be
of
some
interest,
they
didn’t
have
to
decide
it
for
other
reasons.
and
so
we
say
that
in
this
context,
the
draft
resister
and
the
other
class,
there’s
no
use
denying
the
fact
that
there
have
been
number
of
willful
resisters
that
these
people
are
in
a
select
class
of
the
kind
that
this
court
has
spoken
of
who
are
asked
to
come
forward,
give
the
names
on
the
compulsion
and
hence
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
statute.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
who
asked
them?
if
the
police
asked
them?
if
the
question
is
that
the
police
asked
them
of
the
draft
code,
if
he
was
under
a
compulsory
duty
to
register
and
he
came
in
pursuant
to
that
compulsion.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
a
violation
of
law
and
if
its
25
years,
he’d
be
arrested.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
jointly
be
prosecuted.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
at
anytime
after
he
registers
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
ay
anytime
they
asked
him.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
right.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
registration
and
the
registrant.
the
non-registrant
has
already
committed
the
crime.
now,
coming
to
the
third
point
and
i
wish
i
had
more
time
to
explain
this
self-incrimination
argument
but
i
think
its
obvious
and
it’s
either
accepted
or
not
based
on
this
conception
as
i
say
if
congress
had
passed
the
statute
which
said,
let
us
call
in
all
those
who
fail
to
register
in
the
draft
the
last
couple
of
years,
now
please
register.
that
clearly
wouldn’t
be
against
the
fifth
amendment,
under
the
amendment
itself
and
under
the
case
and
so
we
say
this
is
analogous.
now,
on
the
first
amendment,
the
court
itself
below,
the
second
circuit
said
that
in
theory,
it
is
true
that
a
conscientious
objected
to
the
process
of
registration
or
to
have
a
right,
to
have
the
jury
pay
us
on
the
sincerity
of
this
belief.
but
unfortunately
they
said,
i
don’t
say
unfortunate
i
hated
that.
under
present
doctrine,
we
can't
allow
that
stand
and
we
query
what
and
present
doctrine
should
support
that
result.
we
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
toussie
stands
convicted
here
because
of
his
religious
beliefs.
i
don’t
think
the
government
says
that
he
doesn’t
stand
convicted
because
of
religious
beliefs,
if
so
he
is
convicted
for
the
exercise
of
a
first
amendment
right
directly.
now,
if
he
exercise
that
first
amendment
right
directly,
should
he
not
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
jury
pass
on
the
sincerity
of
his
beliefs.
in
other
words,
under
sherbert
against
verner
and
they
way
the
court
has
been
determining
this
first
amendment
questions
lately,
it’s
no
longer
a
question
as
i
see
it
if
whether
there
is
a
vague
constitutional
exemption
for
conscientious
objectors
generally,
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
if
a
man
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
honestly
and
conscientiously
believes
that
registration
is
part
of
the
process
of
killing
and
will
not
register.
is
he
then
to
be
sent
to
jail
without
any
defense
or
whatever?
and
the
question
of
course
is
one
of
balancing
when
the
sherbert
against
verner
and
shapiro
and
other
cases.
this
court
has
now
said
that
in
the
balancing
of
this
interest,
we
do
not
look
to
see
whether
it’s
a
reasonable
regulation
but
whether
there
is
a
compelling
reason
as
to
why
the
government
must
have
this
and
we
vent
you
to
say
with
the
utmost
respect
that
in
this
context,
the
government
doesn’t
need
to
send
people
to
jail.
not
one
more
boy
is
going
to
be
brought
into
the
army
no
matter
which
way
this
goes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
there’s
no
doubt
that
makes
it
easy,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
but
what
does
that
do
to
the
truly
conscientious
objector
who
believes
at
the
process
of
registration
itself?
if
violated
of
his
religious
principles.
that
is
not
answered.
we’re
not
saying
that
this
court
should
overthrow
the
constitutionality
to
selective
services
in
which
you
held
valid
in
nugent.
we’re
not
asking
that
this
man
be
let
out.
we
are
not
saying
that
he
should
be
given
a
medal
for
not
registering
for
religious
reasons.
we
are
saying
that
there’s
so
few
of
this
they’re
not
going
to
the
raising
of
an
army
in
the
first
place
and
on
the
second
place
if
the
issue
is
an
extremely
narrow
one
here.
should
a
jury
be
allowed
to
pay
us
on
the
sincerity
of
disbelief?
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
the
crucible
of
the
criminal
process
in
any
event.
and
therefore,
when
people
say,
well
this
will
open
the
floodgates,
nobody
will
register.
i
say
respectfully,
that
can’t
be
true.
nobody
is
going
to
take
a
chance
on
going
to
jail
who
isn’t
a
dedicated
and
firm
believer
that
in
his
own
conscience,
the
registration
is
part
of
his
process
of
constriction
which
is
part
of
the
process
of
law.
if
your
honors
please,
i
could
expand
on
that
but
i
do
want
to
save
five
minutes
rebuttal
and
i
simply
want
to
say
at
the
end
that
the
principal
dissenter
as
it’s
often
been
said
should
be
the
subject
and
he
is
indeed
the
subject
of
the
greatest
concern
on
this
court.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
principal
dissenter
in
this
field
certainly
subjects
himself
to
the
direst
of
punishments
as
a
felon
and
therefore,
it
is
giving
away
not
very
much
to
permit
a
first
amendment
right
either
directly
or
because
otherwise
you
were
discriminating
between
two
types
of
conscientious
objectives,
those
who
register
on
a
process
and
those
who
by
reason
of
religious
belief
cannot
even
register.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
think
that
under
the
free
exercise
clause
on
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
very
little
history
to
support
the
idea
that
there
is
no
conscientious
objection.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
used
in
his
dissent
in
mcintosh
spoke
of
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
he
didn’t
mention
any
amendment
but
it’s
obvious,
he
meant
the
first
amendment.
we
know
too
that
there
never
was
conscription
until
the
civil
war
in
1863.
we
know
that
at
that
time,
the
first
10
amendments
were
considered
to
be
limiting
the
power
only
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
had
no
army,
so
that
i
think
all
the
resort
to
history
on
both
side
is
then
conclusive
and
i
do
believe
that
when
we
read
the
content
of
what
is
free
exercise
of
religion,
we
must
do
it
in
a
negative
way
in
order
to
avoid
a
constitutional
right
under
the
first
amendment
by
saying
no.
this
is
like
bigamy
or
polygamy.
this
is
something
inimical
to
society
which
of
course
the
court
can
do.
but
we
submit
that
on
the
balancing
of
the
interest
where
the
few
involved
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
and
even
if
it’s
within
the
purview
of
the
right
as
distinguished
from
it,
merely
a
privilege
if
you
will.
there
is
still
is
a
sort
of
due
process
within
the
first
amendment
that
we
think
discriminates
them
between
two
honest
and
principled
religious
people.
one
who
registered
and
the
other
does
not.
we
don’t
ask
you
to
let
the
second
one
off
but
we
do
say
that
if
he
is
willing
to
test
it
in
the
crucible
of
a
criminal
court,
the
jury
should
be
permitted
to
pass
on
the
sincerity.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
born
in
1941
in
june.
he
became
18
on
june
23,
1959.
he
failed
to
register
for
the
draft,
the
reasons
of
conscience
and
was
indicted
after
an
arrest
in
february
of
1967,
almost
eight
years
after
his
initial
failure
to
register.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
he
took
no
steps
but
if
i
may,
your
honor
in
connection
with
my
argument
on
the
first
amendment,
i
shall
try
to
expand
that
a
little
further.
i'm
trying
to
make
a
summary
statement
of
facts
now
so
that
i
can
indicate
to
the
court
the
three
points
we
should
like
to
argue
within
the
short
space
of
time
allotted.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
the
first
statement
i
want
to
make
on
that
is
that
i
will
not
get
involve
at
this
time
in
the
reasons
why
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
a
sincerity
of
belief
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
he
could
not
take
part
in
the
registration
process
itself
because
his
was
a
pristine
religious
view
that
the
registration
process
itself
was
merely
an
extension
of
the
war
making
in
which
he
was
against.
it
should
be
recalled
that
in
1959
when
the
petitioner
willfully
failed
to
register,
there
was
no
war
going
on.
the
korean
war
had
been
finished.
there
was
no
vietnam
war
at
that
time.
as
i
say,
he
was
arrested
eight
years
after
the
event.
the
general
statute
of
limitations
as
we
know
is
a
five-year
statute
and
in
the
words
of
that
statute
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
adequate
and
proper
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
prior
to
the
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
having
run
which
was
denied.
the
trial
was
held
and
at
the
trial
counsel
for
petitioner
requested
a
jury
charge
to
the
effect
that
if
the
jury
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
petitioner
and
that
his
failure
to
register
was
due
to
his
religious
conscience
that
they
should
acquit.
this
request
to
charge
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
a
conviction
by
the
jury
and
suit.
in
this
court
as
we
did
below,
we
make
three
points.
first,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
five-year
statute
and
that
any
extension
beyond
it
is
beyond
the
legislative
intention,
the
congressional
intention
and
indeed
the
prerogative
of
the
executive.
secondly,
we
say
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations
point
to
save.
it
is
only
save
thus
the
court
below
indicated
by
holding
that
a
regulation
and
not
a
statute
created
a
continuing
duty
to
register
and
that
by
just
the
possession
of
the
words,
the
continuing
duty
even
though
congress
said
nothing
about
a
continuing
offense,
ipso
facto
made
a
continuous
offense
as
if
congress
had
specifically
mandated
it.
and
if
that
be
the
construction
of
the
statute,
then
it
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
of
the
petitioner.
the
last
point
which
i
hope
we
shall
have
some
time
to
discuss
is
that
we
believe
that
under
the
first
amendment,
the
minimum
that
we
are
asking
here
is
covered
by
that
amendment
and
that
is,
that
when
a
religious
principle
objector,
objects
the
registration
as
part
of
the
process.
while
it
is
true,
he
must
subject
himself
to
the
criminal
process
at
the
same
time
he
has
a
right
when
he
is
tried
to
a
jury
to
have
an
instruction
that
if
the
jury
believes
he
is
religiously
sincere
that
they
should
recognize
in
the
context
of
this
whole
problem,
his
religious
conscience
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
i
may
turn
first
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
if
your
honors
please.
as
a
result
of
the
decision
below
by
the
distinguished
second
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
other
circuits,
we
are
now
in
the
state
of
law
that
a
narcotics
peddler
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
five
years.
a
man
who
sells
defense
secrets
to
a
foreign
government
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
ten
years.
the
boy
of
18
who
fails
to
register
for
selective
service
is
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations
of
13
years
and
the
questions
is,
how
did
this
come
about
and
is
this
harsh
result
sound.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
in
this
face,
i'm
not
raising
a
constitutional
question,
your
honor,
except
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
black?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no.
i'm
raising
the
question
(a)
as
to
the
intention
of
congress
which
is
not
expressed
and
(b)
that
without
the
intention
of
congress,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
regulation
is
construed
as
i
have
indicated
it
was
below,
it
is
a
non-constitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power
by
the
congress
to
the
president
and
that
hence,
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers,
it
is
unconstitutional,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
correct.
i
need
to
spell
it
out
because
i
thought
it
was
obvious
but
what
the
court
did
below
in
order
to
get
around
this
problem
was
to
say
although
the
regulation
which
i
shall
read
in
a
minute,
perhaps
i’ll
read
it
now.
although
the
regulation
says
that
the
duty
the
register
shall
be
continuous
at
all
times,
two
circuits
have
construed
at
all
times
to
mean
for
life
apparently
because
there
are
two
circuits
that
seem
to
upheld
that
even
if
the
man
is
over
26,
rather
is
the
statute
goes
beyond
age
26,
he
can
still
be
prosecuted
which
would
make
a
man
of
70
subject
to
prosecution
and
this
court
had
a
collateral
problem
like
that
gara
which
was
affirmed
by
a
divided
court
four
to
four
in
1950.
but
it
was
a
collateral
case
so
we
really
don’t
know
what
the
court
held.
now
in
the
second
circuit,
they
held
that
the
regulation
merely
limited
to
26
and
therefore
it’s
obvious
that
a
boy
of
18
must
wait
till
26
which
is
eight
years
and
then
five
years
thereafter.
it’s
five
and
that’s
where
i
get
my
13
years
which
is
exactly
what
was
done
below
in
this
case.
now,
the
regulation,
i
don’t
think
means,
i
say
this
with
most
respect
designation,
what
it
has
been
construed
to
me
and
i
don’t
think
it
needs
much
of
a
gloss
as
to
what
was
intended.
at
page
813
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
the
regulation
says,
the
duty
of
every
person
subject
to
registration
to
present
himself
for
and
submit
to
registration
shall
continue
at
all
times
and
if
for
any
reason,
any
such
person
is
not
registered
on
the
day
or
one
of
the
days
fixed
his
registration.
he
should
immediately
present
himself
for
and
submit
to
registration
before
the
local
board
in
the
area
where
you
have
to
submit.
and
the
word
immediately,
the
very
peculiar
word,
if
you’re
talking
about
a
continuing
duty.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fair
entrance
of
this
is
that
in
issuing
the
regulations
under
the
statute
which
permitted
the
president
to
fix
the
time
with
times
and
place
of
place
of
registration
which
naturally
congress
had
to
do,
they
could
not
watch
everyday
the
registration.
but
all
these
means
is
that
if
a
man
was
sick
or
absent
from
the
country
or
out
of
town
or
something
else
happened
which
was
not
willful
that
he
should
not
believe
that
he
was
thereafter
forever
discharged
from
his
duty
because
at
age
18
he
could
not
register.
otherwise,
the
word
immediately
makes
very
little
sense.
and
i
say,
if
we
can
take
it
in
this
context,
your
honors,
you
have
a
very
simple
administrative
regulation
here
that
there’s
not
in
its
face
before
to
create
a
real
continuing
duty
and
certainly
on
its
face,
there’s
nothing
about
a
continuing
effects.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
well,
i
think
immediately
if
just
to
gloss
and
i
can’t
read
the
mind
of
congress
not
of
the
drafters
of
the
regulation,
mr.
the
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
to
catch
willful
offender
to
violate
the
law
that
beyond
the
pale.
i
think
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
notifying
people
for
a
perfectly
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
register
under
the
draft
law
to
a
simple
point
that
if
they
are
not
available
on
the
day
when
they
are
suppose
to
register,
that
they’re
suppose
to
register
thereafter.
now
when
it
says
immediately
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
same
result
should
follow
but
i
think
the
word
immediately
does
tend
to
help
us
in
construing
it
merely
as
an
administrative
regulation
and
not
as
the
courts
below
did
as
an
effect
and
substitution
for
a
statute
extending
the
general
statute
of
limitations
beyond
five
years.
now,
the
process
by
which
the
court
below
arrived
at
extending
statute
was
by
acknowledging
very
frankly
and
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
certainly
is
a
distinguished
opinion
in
terms
of
facing
the
problems
that
arose
and
let
me
decided
against
this,
we
said
we
cannot
complain
about
the
fairness
of
the
judicial
reasoning
that
led
to
the
result
and
they
recognize
all
the
problems
there.
that
court
did
not
as
the
government
now
contends
say
that
you
can
read
anything
into
that
statute.
they
honestly
said,
we
cannot
read
it
into
the
statute.
there
isn’t
any
such
thing
because
the
statute
of
limitation.
the
general
statute
just
accept
according
as
otherwise
provided
according
to
law.
assume
the
congress
can
make
a
13
years
statute
of
limitations
and
none
of
the
your
question
mr.
justice
black
if
it
chose
to
but
the
question
is,
did
it
choose
to?
what
is
there
in
this
statute
which
simply
says
that
the
president
may
say
when
a
boy
shall
come
in
and
register?
what
is
there
in
that
statute?
it
gives
the
executive
power
to
promulgate
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
recognize
as
in
practical
effect
and
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitation.
now,
we
think
that
this
court
over
the
years
and
misquote
way
back
as
always
lean
over
backwards
if
i
may
use
the
colloquial
phrase
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitations.
it
runs
against
the
grain
of
lawyers
and
judges,
generally,
the
whole
system
of
criminal
justice
to
permit
by
extensions
by
back
way
or
back
doors
methods
by
ambiguities
the
creation
of
extensions
of
statutes
of
limitation
and
this
court
has
so
held
many
time.
now,
the
reason
for
it
is
perfectly
obvious
and
i
go
beyond
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
historical
material
that
we
put
into
the
brief.
your
honors,
we’ll
see
that
going
back
to
england
and
going
back
to
the
colonies
and
certainly
to
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
there
has
not
have
been
any
question
but
that
a
statute
of
limitations
must
be
created
by
the
legislature
and
not
by
the
executive.
and
it’s
one
of
those
fundamental
things
in
the
separation
of
powers
that
it
sees
to
me
has
gone
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
various
attempts
to
try
to
change
by
indirection
generally
at
the
instance
of
the
government
the
normal
rules
applicable
to
the
meaning
of
english
words
and
so.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
cannot
do
more.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
late
year
and
yet
on
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
right.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
judge
(inaudible)
did.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
point
i’m
making
is
a
very
simple
one
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
that
you
can
have
the
rulings
of
the
two
circuits
which
have
said
it
goes
for
all
time
as
against
the
ruling
of
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
we
say
they’re
both
wrong.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
--
is
age
26.
and
then
where
it
goes
to
age
31.
now
that
was
the
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
--
as
i
understand
the
gist
of
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
that
is
what
i
am
addressing
myself
to
now,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no,
it’s
right
on
line
with
my
thinking
if
i
may
suggest.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
when
you
have
a
continuing
duty
statute,
that
does
not
mean
that
you
have
a
continuing
offense
by
legislative
enactment.
i
go
back
to
an
old
case
in
this
court,
united
states
against
derwine
(ph)
which
goes
back
to
1870
or
something
of
that
kind.
in
that
case,
the
question
came
up
where
is
somebody
embezzled
funds
when
did
the
statute
begin
to
run.
it
had
been
held
below
that
since
he
had
a
duty
to
return
the
funds,
the
statute
had
not
run.
this
court
held
that
once
an
act
is
done
which
makes
it
a
completed
crime
then
the
statute
begins
to
run.
now,
congress
itself
knows
how
to
create
continuous
offenses
as
is
evidenced
for
example
by
the
bankruptcy
statute.
the
bankruptcy
statute
says
very
clearly
the
concealment
of
assets
of
a
bankrupt
or
other
debtor
shall
be
deemed
to
be
not
a
continuing
duty.
a
continuing
offense
until
the
debtor
shall
have
been
finally
discharged
or
discharged
denied
and
the
period
of
limitation
shall
not
begin
to
run
until
such
final
discharge
or
denial
of
discharge.
he
will
find
nothing,
your
honors.
in
the
selective
service
act,
which
remotely
relates
to
the
statute
of
limitations
or
even
to
the
creation
of
a
continuous
offense
and
so
we
say
analytically
as
well
as
historically
what
makes
it
necessary
to
say
if
we
are
to
adopt
the
liberal
construction
of
statutes
of
limitations
that
just
because
we
have
a
duty
that
that
necessarily
means
that
we
have
a
continuous
offense.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
there
maybe
a
duty
to
register
but
we
should
not
take
it
of
the
normal
concept
of
statutes
of
limitations
if
i
steal.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
because
under
normal
rules
of
statute
of
limitations
and
of
continuous
offenses,
i
believe
the
rule
is
and
should
be
that
once
the
crime
is
completed.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i’ll
put
it
to
you
this
way.
it
is
completed
in
this
sense
that
if
the
defendant
were
apprehended,
let
us
say
in
his
19th
birthday,
he
couldn’t
say
to
the
prosecutor,
now
wait
a
minute,
i
still
have
time
till
i’m
26.
he
is
in
the
toils.
he
has
committed
a
completed
crime
and
i
say,
your
honors,
that
if
he
has
committed
a
completed
crime,
what
is
there
to
say
by
virtue
of
legislative
mandate
that
that
is
to
be
treated
differently
from
any
other
(voice
overlap).
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
correct.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
in
five
days.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
the
statutory
obligation.
that’s
what
i
think
it
means.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
and
i
can’t
defend
myself
by
saying
no,
i
have
seven
more
years
or
five
years,
i’m
through.
i’m
a
criminal
and
i
think
it’s
right
to
the
second
point
because
of
the
time
and
let’s
take
it
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
would
say
that
when
he
became
to
be
23
he
could
not.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
no,
i
say
he
may
have
a
duty
to
register
but
that
doesn’t
have
to
be
a
criminal
sanction.
there
are
many
duties
in
life
and
in
statutes
but
we
don’t
have
criminal
in
sanctions
that
happens
everyday.
now
if
i
steal
you
prize,
i
certainly
have
a
duty
to
return
it
to
you,
i
have
a
duty
for
life.
but
as
far
as
statute
limitations
is
concerned,
you
cannot
apprehend
me
more
than
five
years
after
i
still
stole
the
prize,
but
i
still
owe
you
the
prize
and
that’s
the
role
i
say
is
that
there's
been
a
gloss
upon
a
gloss
here.
in
the
first
place,
congress
never
said
so
and
congress
is
the
only
one
to
say
so.
second
place,
the
regulation
itself
is
an
ambiguous
and
in
the
third
place
by
every
rule
of
liberal
construction
and
criminal
cases,
the
rule
ought
to
be
and
we
think
is
that
the
statute
begin
to
run
when
the
crime
was
complete
and
the
test
of
when
the
crime
is
complete
this
could
the
man
have
been
apprehended
at
that
time
or
would
still
have
an
offense
and
that’s
our
position
on
that.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
the
only
analogy
is
in
the
alien
registration
acts
which
raise
the
same
problem
in
the
sense
and
where
there
has
been
some
different
view.
i
believe
that
they’ve
also
held
there
that
there’s
a
continuous
offense
but
i
think
the
policy
with
respect
to
aliens
is
a
separate
policy.
it
will
take
too
long
that
it
went
to
here
but
i
think
there
is
reserve
part
of
the
brilliant
and
which
make
it
different.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
you
mean
that
it
in
fact
everything?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
there
is
a
difficulty
but
so
is
there
a
difficulty
in
apprehending
a
thief
or
any
common
criminal.
and
i
don’t
think
that
these
lads
are
in
any
different
position
in
any
other
criminals
and
that’s
why
i
use
that
analogy,
may
have
seen
startling
or
perhaps
traumatic
but
the
fact
that
it
does
appeal
to
me
as
anomaly
that
a
narcotics
peddler
should
have
--
should
be
subject
to
five-year
term
of
limitations
and
i
believe
18
should
be
subject
to
13
years.
but
that
i
leave
because
my
time
is
running
on
that.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
true.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that
is
true.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
the
limitation
is
only
for
that
reason
but
also
for
reasons
of
repose
as
the
courts
have
often
said.
now,
coming
to
the
second
point
and
i’m
sure
i
won't
have
time
for
the
third,
i
merely
downgrade
it,
your
honor,
i'm
saving
five
minutes
for
the
rebuttal.
the
--
once
you
say
that
the
only
reason
to
see
the
petitioner
here
is
in
trouble
is
because
you
extended
that
statute
of
limitations
because
he
had
a
compulsory
duty
to
register.
then
it
is
if
you
are
creating
two
statutes.
you
have
first
the
statute
which
makes
him
a
criminal
because
of
i
think
we
all
concede,
he
certainly
could
have
been
arrested
shortly
after
his
18th
birthday
if
he
willfully
fail
to
register.
and
then
you
say
to
him,
now
you
are
compelled
to
register
and
by
registering,
identify
yourself
with
your
name
and
age
and
birthday
and
by
that
very
identification,
you
are
submitting
yourself
to
prosecution
in
a
sense
of
whether
this
is
an
all
force
with
even
albertson
and
marchetti
in
spirit
and
theory.
it
is
an
even
more
pristine
violation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
because
here
you
do
have
an
act
which
can't
be
equivocal
really,
the
act
itself
of
registering
and
giving
your
name
and
birthday
is
enough
to
convict
you
so
we
don’t
have
talk
here
about
change
and
links
and
evidence
and
substantial
danger
of
incrimination.
now,
and
we
suggest
that
in
that
context
and
i
must
say
the
third
circuit
by
the
way
if
it
1955
before
this
whole
series
of
cases
indicated
that
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
problem
in
alien
registration
cases
and
we’ve
cited
it
in
our
brief
there
might
be
of
some
interest,
they
didn’t
have
to
decide
it
for
other
reasons.
and
so
we
say
that
in
this
context,
the
draft
resister
and
the
other
class,
there’s
no
use
denying
the
fact
that
there
have
been
number
of
willful
resisters
that
these
people
are
in
a
select
class
of
the
kind
that
this
court
has
spoken
of
who
are
asked
to
come
forward,
give
the
names
on
the
compulsion
and
hence
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
statute.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
who
asked
them?
if
the
police
asked
them?
if
the
question
is
that
the
police
asked
them
of
the
draft
code,
if
he
was
under
a
compulsory
duty
to
register
and
he
came
in
pursuant
to
that
compulsion.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
yes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
a
violation
of
law
and
if
its
25
years,
he’d
be
arrested.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
jointly
be
prosecuted.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
oh!
at
anytime
after
he
registers
--
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
ay
anytime
they
asked
him.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
that’s
right.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
registration
and
the
registrant.
the
non-registrant
has
already
committed
the
crime.
now,
coming
to
the
third
point
and
i
wish
i
had
more
time
to
explain
this
self-incrimination
argument
but
i
think
its
obvious
and
it’s
either
accepted
or
not
based
on
this
conception
as
i
say
if
congress
had
passed
the
statute
which
said,
let
us
call
in
all
those
who
fail
to
register
in
the
draft
the
last
couple
of
years,
now
please
register.
that
clearly
wouldn’t
be
against
the
fifth
amendment,
under
the
amendment
itself
and
under
the
case
and
so
we
say
this
is
analogous.
now,
on
the
first
amendment,
the
court
itself
below,
the
second
circuit
said
that
in
theory,
it
is
true
that
a
conscientious
objected
to
the
process
of
registration
or
to
have
a
right,
to
have
the
jury
pay
us
on
the
sincerity
of
this
belief.
but
unfortunately
they
said,
i
don’t
say
unfortunate
i
hated
that.
under
present
doctrine,
we
can't
allow
that
stand
and
we
query
what
and
present
doctrine
should
support
that
result.
we
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
toussie
stands
convicted
here
because
of
his
religious
beliefs.
i
don’t
think
the
government
says
that
he
doesn’t
stand
convicted
because
of
religious
beliefs,
if
so
he
is
convicted
for
the
exercise
of
a
first
amendment
right
directly.
now,
if
he
exercise
that
first
amendment
right
directly,
should
he
not
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
jury
pass
on
the
sincerity
of
his
beliefs.
in
other
words,
under
sherbert
against
verner
and
they
way
the
court
has
been
determining
this
first
amendment
questions
lately,
it’s
no
longer
a
question
as
i
see
it
if
whether
there
is
a
vague
constitutional
exemption
for
conscientious
objectors
generally,
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
if
a
man
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
honestly
and
conscientiously
believes
that
registration
is
part
of
the
process
of
killing
and
will
not
register.
is
he
then
to
be
sent
to
jail
without
any
defense
or
whatever?
and
the
question
of
course
is
one
of
balancing
when
the
sherbert
against
verner
and
shapiro
and
other
cases.
this
court
has
now
said
that
in
the
balancing
of
this
interest,
we
do
not
look
to
see
whether
it’s
a
reasonable
regulation
but
whether
there
is
a
compelling
reason
as
to
why
the
government
must
have
this
and
we
vent
you
to
say
with
the
utmost
respect
that
in
this
context,
the
government
doesn’t
need
to
send
people
to
jail.
not
one
more
boy
is
going
to
be
brought
into
the
army
no
matter
which
way
this
goes.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
there’s
no
doubt
that
makes
it
easy,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
but
what
does
that
do
to
the
truly
conscientious
objector
who
believes
at
the
process
of
registration
itself?
if
violated
of
his
religious
principles.
that
is
not
answered.
we’re
not
saying
that
this
court
should
overthrow
the
constitutionality
to
selective
services
in
which
you
held
valid
in
nugent.
we’re
not
asking
that
this
man
be
let
out.
we
are
not
saying
that
he
should
be
given
a
medal
for
not
registering
for
religious
reasons.
we
are
saying
that
there’s
so
few
of
this
they’re
not
going
to
the
raising
of
an
army
in
the
first
place
and
on
the
second
place
if
the
issue
is
an
extremely
narrow
one
here.
should
a
jury
be
allowed
to
pay
us
on
the
sincerity
of
disbelief?
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
the
crucible
of
the
criminal
process
in
any
event.
and
therefore,
when
people
say,
well
this
will
open
the
floodgates,
nobody
will
register.
i
say
respectfully,
that
can’t
be
true.
nobody
is
going
to
take
a
chance
on
going
to
jail
who
isn’t
a
dedicated
and
firm
believer
that
in
his
own
conscience,
the
registration
is
part
of
his
process
of
constriction
which
is
part
of
the
process
of
law.
if
your
honors
please,
i
could
expand
on
that
but
i
do
want
to
save
five
minutes
rebuttal
and
i
simply
want
to
say
at
the
end
that
the
principal
dissenter
as
it’s
often
been
said
should
be
the
subject
and
he
is
indeed
the
subject
of
the
greatest
concern
on
this
court.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
principal
dissenter
in
this
field
certainly
subjects
himself
to
the
direst
of
punishments
as
a
felon
and
therefore,
it
is
giving
away
not
very
much
to
permit
a
first
amendment
right
either
directly
or
because
otherwise
you
were
discriminating
between
two
types
of
conscientious
objectives,
those
who
register
on
a
process
and
those
who
by
reason
of
religious
belief
cannot
even
register.
mr.
murray
i.
gurfein
i
think
that
under
the
free
exercise
clause
on
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
very
little
history
to
support
the
idea
that
there
is
no
conscientious
objection.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
used
in
his
dissent
in
mcintosh
spoke
of
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
he
didn’t
mention
any
amendment
but
it’s
obvious,
he
meant
the
first
amendment.
we
know
too
that
there
never
was
conscription
until
the
civil
war
in
1863.
we
know
that
at
that
time,
the
first
10
amendments
were
considered
to
be
limiting
the
power
only
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
had
no
army,
so
that
i
think
all
the
resort
to
history
on
both
side
is
then
conclusive
and
i
do
believe
that
when
we
read
the
content
of
what
is
free
exercise
of
religion,
we
must
do
it
in
a
negative
way
in
order
to
avoid
a
constitutional
right
under
the
first
amendment
by
saying
no.
this
is
like
bigamy
or
polygamy.
this
is
something
inimical
to
society
which
of
course
the
court
can
do.
but
we
submit
that
on
the
balancing
of
the
interest
where
the
few
involved
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
and
even
if
it’s
within
the
purview
of
the
right
as
distinguished
from
it,
merely
a
privilege
if
you
will.
there
is
still
is
a
sort
of
due
process
within
the
first
amendment
that
we
think
discriminates
them
between
two
honest
and
principled
religious
people.
one
who
registered
and
the
other
does
not.
we
don’t
ask
you
to
let
the
second
one
off
but
we
do
say
that
if
he
is
willing
to
test
it
in
the
crucible
of
a
criminal
court,
the
jury
should
be
permitted
to
pass
on
the
sincerity.
