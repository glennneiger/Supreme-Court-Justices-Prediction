unknown
speaker
so
why
could
he
wait
till
he
was
25,
if
he
was
here
when
he
was
18.
unknown
speaker
or
does
that
refer
to
male
citizen?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
it
does.
it
says
male
citizen.
unknown
speaker
only
under
the
male
person?
unknown
speaker
no
but
actually,
i
suppose
if
he
came
in
and
registered
10
days
after
his
18th
birthday,
he
still
be
guilty
of
the
offense
of
not
coming
in
to
register
five
days.
unknown
speaker
now
we
think
that’s
reasonable.
solicitor
general
question,
he
said
there
was
no
split.
i
understood
that
there
was
that
this
is
the
view
of
this
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
and
other
courts
of
appeals.
i
thought
that
instead
of
their
being
in
effect
of
13
years
statute
of
limitations.
there
was
a
non-limited
period
of
time
during
which
person
could
be
prosecuted.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well
i
would
consider
that
a
difference
of
opinion
or
as
mr.
justice
harlan’s
word
of
split
of
authority
or
split
of
opinion.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
immediate
of
governance?
these
things
--
if
he
does
come
in
age
19,
21,
or
22,
he
does
incriminate
himself,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
the
government
never
heard
of
him
until
then.
unknown
speaker
and
they
now
discover
that
here
he
is
and
he
didn’t
come
in
five
days
after
his
18th
birthday.
doesn’t
it
--
the
government
then
have
a
basis
of
prosecuting?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
we
get
over
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
answer
is
then
there’s
no
violation
of
the
proof?
unknown
speaker
now
why
is
it
had
voluntary?
why
is
he
voluntary
on
your
with
theory
of
offense?
why
would
if
he
comes
in
at
19,
21,
it’s
not
compelled
to
follow
--
unknown
speaker
no,
but
testing
whether
or
not
which
is
on
the
american,
this
is
a
privilege
on
you.
so
i
understand
you
the
court
of
appeals
may
gather
the
government
adopts
the
court
of
appeals
position.
the
court
of
appeals
position
is
that
there’s
nothing
compulsory
about
this.
he
doesn’t
register
at
19
to
21
under
any
compulsion
and
neither
with
privilege
is
not
violated,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn’t
rest
on
any
attribution
of
voluntary
as
to
his
coming
in
and
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
rests
on
that
because
it’s
a
continuing
offense.
unknown
speaker
you’re
saying
though
that
--
you
do
say
that
if
he
ask
someone
at
age
21
and
he
not
having
to
register
before,
if
he
ask
somebody,
am
i
under
illegal
duty
to
register
now.
they
should
tell
him
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
he
has
them
well
that
i
can't
be
punished
any
more
than
i
already
could
be
by
not
registering
now.
they
say
yes
but
it’s
like
do
you
have
illegal
duty.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
responding
to
that
illegal
duty.
he
is
not
compulsion
for
fifth
amendment
purpose.
unknown
speaker
oh!
it’s
not
self-incriminated
by
committing
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
we’re
talking
about
the
privilege
it’s
whether
there’s
compulsory
self-incrimination,
that’s
we’re
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
so
when
he
comes
in
and
registers
at
21,
he
certainly
is,
let
the
government
know
that
he’s
failed
in
his
duty
up
to
them.
unknown
speaker
but
he
hasn’t
been
upheld
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
not
your
point?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
in
fact
you
should
be
construed
to
bar
criminal
prosecution
if
the
fellow
voluntary
registers?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
statute
of
limitation
does
begin
to
run
five
days
after
the
time
when
he
fail
to
register?
what
about
this
case?
unknown
speaker
then
what?
unknown
speaker
in
fact
it
was
a
continuing
offense;
it
wouldn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
it
then,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
your
view
here
is
although
he
was
guilty
of
the
offense
five
days
after
he
came
18,
he
could
be
indicted
at
any
time
thereafter.
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
mean
them
all.
i
just
want
to
be
cleared.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
they
couldn’t
prosecute
him
twice
for
failing
to
register.
unknown
speaker
does
that
amount
to
any
great
handicap
in
the
department
of
justice
and
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
what
i
mean,
the
man
has
committed
an
offense
and
you
say
that
he
continuous
to
commit
that
offense,
would
it
amount
to
any
great
handicap
to
the
department
of
justice
to
require
them
to
prosecute
them
within
five
years
from
the
time
it
was
committed?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
not.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
he
hadn’t
been
prosecuted.
unknown
speaker
if
you
admit
then
of
course
it’s
proper
that
the
offense
has
been
committed
five
days
after
he
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
and
it
has
run
five
years.
the
government
hadn't
prosecuted.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
government
get
to
learn
that
this
man
has
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
what
sentence
did
he
get?
unknown
speaker
district
court
judge
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
so
why
could
he
wait
till
he
was
25,
if
he
was
here
when
he
was
18.
unknown
speaker
or
does
that

male
citizen?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
it
