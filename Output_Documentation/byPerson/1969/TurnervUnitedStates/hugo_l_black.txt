black
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
challenging
the
right
of
congress
to
fix
the
amount
of
evidence
that
will
authorize
or
compel
a
jury
to
convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
you're
doing
it
indirectly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
you
hesitate
to
do
it
directly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
congress
--
in
the
congress
interfere
to
the
constitutional
rule,
functions
of
the
court
to
try
cases
any
more
than
the
court
can
interfere
for
the
right
of
congress
to
pass
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
the
charges
you
have
directed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
clerk
would
have
charged
you
do
you
have
directed,
but
there
is
a
presumption
that
this
defendant
is
guilty
from
these
facts,
did
you
return
them
loose?
what
would
happen
to
his
case
thereafter
and
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
would
be
acquitted
and
there's
a
provision
in
the
constitution
that
a
man
should
not
be
put
in
jeopardy
twice
for
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
i
supposed
the
government
will
admit
that
congress
couldn't
foreclose
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wouldn't
think
it
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
combine
two
things
in
one
sentence,
you
said
that
a
jury
might
have
rationally
found,
that
was
all
standing
alone,
and
the
second
was
i
might
have
been
authorized
by
congress,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
rely
on
to
say
that
congress
can
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
jury
may
rationally
consider
to
be
the
truth?
justice
hugo

you
have
a
good
ground
argument.
