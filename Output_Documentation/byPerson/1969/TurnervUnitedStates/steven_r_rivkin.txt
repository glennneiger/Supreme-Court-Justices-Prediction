mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
other
issues
in
this
case
beyond
the
issue
of
self
incrimination
arising
from
the
statutory
presumptions
on
which
the
petitioner
for
--
the
petitioner
has
rested.
because
of
the
presence
of
these
issues,
i
have
filed
in
behalf
of
the
amicus
two
briefs
in
this
case
and
i
would
now
like
to
make
this
brief
supplementary
argument.
i
want
a
dwell
on
the
issue
that
was
preserved
in
the
leary
case
last
term,
the
resolution
here,
the
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
statutory
presumption
in
21
usc
section
174
with
respect
to
hard
narcotics.
then
time
permitting,
i
would
like
to
point
briefly
to
the
other
arguments
post
in
the
briefs
of
the
amicus.
the
leary
case
invalidated
the
virtually
identical
statutory
presumption
in
21
usc
176
(a)
similarly
involving
a
statutory
influence
arising
from
mere
possession
of
foreign
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
with
respect
to
marijuana
and
it
has
specifically
left
for
a
future
case
separate
consideration
of
the
similar
question
with
respect
to
hard
drugs.
subsequent
to
the
leary
case
and
in
response
to
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
the
government
has
conceded
error
with
respect
to
the
drug
cocaine
and
has
prayed
for
reversal
on
count
three.
by
so
doing,
it
is
our
position
that
the
government
has
now
dissolved
any
line
remaining
after
leary
between
marijuana
and
hard
drugs.
applying
the
task
of
that
and
prior
cases
to
the
drug
heroin,
the
remaining
drug
in
the
petitioner's
possession.
21
usc
section
174
is
embraced
fully
within
the
prohibition
of
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
has
always
given
deference
to
the
ability
of
congress
to
fashion
evidentiary
rules
but
that
deference
has
always
been
based
and
set
forth
in
the
top
case
on
the
congress's
ability
to
see
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
in
broader
relationship
than
that
might
--
that
might
be
presented
to
the
jury.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
here,
that
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
1909
when
it
passed
the
import
and
export
act
with
respect
to
narcotic
drugs
was
working
a
total
prohibition
on
the
import
and
under
domestic
possession
and
use
of
heroin.
it
was
not
making
a
judgment
of
a
common
relationship
of
facts
such
as
the
congress
was
doing
in
the
statute
which
was
involved
in
gainey
case
and
the
romano
case
26
usc
5601
in
which
it
was
determining
that
because
of
the
tendency
of
steels
to
be
located
in
hidden
places,
that
they
are
maybe
assumed
to
be
in
relationship
with
regard
to
anyone
who
is
found
present
thereat.
therefore,
realizing
that
we
must
look
behind
the
normal
deference
which
is
to
be
accorded
to
the
congress
in
these
matters,
we
must
apply
to
these
presumptions
the
tests
which
have
been
most
recently
stated
in
leary
and
which
have
been
also
stated
in
tot,
those
tests
are
that
there
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
and
evidence
and
the
fact
presumed
there
from.
based
on
a
connection
and
common
experience
and
capable
of
giving
rise
to
substantial
assurance
that
the
presumed
fact
is
more
likely
than
not
to
flow
from
fact
and
evidence.
if
we
apply
this
tests
to
the
possession
here
in
question
both
logically
and
empirically
with
respect
to
21
usc
174,
we
must
come
to
a
conclusion
that
we
cannot
reach
substantial
assurance
that
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
in
evidence
and
the
facts
unlawful
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
which
the
congress
would
have
the
courts
presume.
with
respect
to
unlawful
importation,
there
are
at
least
four
alternatives
for
the
source
of
heroin
in
the
possession
of
the
petitioner.
this
morning,
mr.
straus
made
reference
to
the
statute
21
usc
section
513
by
which
heroin
and
any
other
drug
may
in
fact
be
lawfully
imported
to
the
united
states.
lawfully
imported
for
scientific
purposes
and
for
subsequent
license,
but
i
would
want
that
if
petitioner
turner
and
any
other
possessor
of
heroin
had
come
in
possession
of
such
a
drug
without
such
a
license,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
the
second
source
would
be
lawful
importation
of
source
material
and
subsequent
deviation
and
manufacture
of
that
source
material
into
heroin.
the
source
material
commonly
acknowledged
for
heroin
derived
as
it
is
ultimately
from
the
opium
poppy
is
raw
opium
and
morphine.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
is
also
evidence
which
the
government
does
not
contradict,
indeed
it
confirms
that
codeine
may
also
be
a
source
for
heroin.
using
the
government's
statistics
which
the
government
has
applied
as
the
basis
for
concluding
in
this
case
that
cocaine
may
in
fact
not
be
unlawfully
imported
to
the
united
states,
we
come
to
a
conclusion
that
there
is
a
rather
high
potential
of
domestic
manufacture
of
the
heroin
drug.
the
government
concedes
both
the
possibility
and
the
technical
ease
with
which
heroin
maybe
manufactured.
the
government's
reports
mentioned
efforts
to
manufacture
heroin
and
moreover,
the
government,
both
federal
and
state
have
attempted
to
prosecute
people
for
the
effort
of
manufacturing
heroin
from
source
materials
otherwise
present
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
the
recent
concerns
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
for
cough
syrups
which
have
raw
traces
of
codeine
within
them
and
for
paragor
which
contain
opium
suggest
that
the
source
material
for
the
substance
in
the
possessor
of
heroin's
hands
maybe
as
handy
as
the
local
supermarket
or
drugstore.
the
third
element
which
i
would
suggest
is
present
to
vitiate
the
assurance
of
unlawful
importation
is
that
the
opium
poppy
may
have
been
grown
in
the
united
states.
indeed,
that
prospect
was
itself
the
basis
on
which
congress
passed
the
narcotics
control
acts
in
the
early
part
of
the
century.
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
it
is
agriculturally
possible
to
grow
opium
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
there
is
a
regime
of
federal
control
and
licensing
over
the
opium
poppy
in
the
united
states
and
there
have
been
prosecutions
reported
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
for
individuals
who
have
attempted
to
grow
that
product.
the
government
moreover
in
its
brief
has
also
confirmed
that
there
are
instances
where
opium
is
grown
today
in
the
united
states.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
would
not
apply
mr.
chief
justice
either
a
100%
standard
or
a
51%
standard
to
what
the
government
might
--
must
substantiate.
i
would
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
well,
the
particular
language
with
which
one
may
deal
in
nice
points
is
substantial
assurance
that
more,
that
it
has
more
probably
than
not
come
about
it,
so
i
would
say
even
if
there
were
a
51%
requirement,
one
must
feel
quite
sure
in
fact
to
a
point
that
one
might
speak
of
as
beyond
to
a
moral
certainty
that
the
particular
substance
was
unlawfully
imported
to
the
united
states.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
no,
and
i
don't
ask,
this
one
does.
i
merely
say
that
when
we
think
in
terms
of
the
burden
that
the
government
must
substantiate.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
we're
not
thinking
such
quantitative
terms.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
does
in
terms
that
tot
uses
strain
one's
tolerance
to
apply
that
test
to
the
substance.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
in
the
light
of
the
showings
which
i'm
making
here
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
the
circumstance.
finally,
i
would
add
that
there
also
is
the
prospect,
that
the
drug
might
be
wholly
synthesized
in
the
united
states
from
sources
which
are
unregulated
and
which
are
commonly
available.
this
possibility
has
been
acknowledged
by
the
government
in
its
briefs.
on
balance,
the
government
has
attempted
to
come
to
grips
with
these
alternatives
and
they
have
concluded
in
their
own
terms
that
if
heroin
is
available
in
the
united
states
domestically
manufactured
and
produced,
that
the
likelihood
is
less
than
1%.
i
would
point
out
that
first
of
all,
one
must
be
aware
when
one
judges
the
validity
of
this
projection
of
the
sources
from
which
the
government's
data
are
drawn.
those
sources
can
only
be
in
this
circumstances,
the
list
and
the
numbers
and
quantities
of
drugs
that
have
been
confiscated
at
ports
and
borders
and
those
that
may
have
been
confiscated
overseas.
and
these
by
this
very
basis
i
would
submit
have
absolutely
no
basis
as
a
rational
source
of
inference
for
any
substance
that
maybe
domestically
produced.
the
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
it
--
it
might,
on
the
other
hand
it
might
also
raise
the
incentive
for
local
manufacture
your
honor
by
driving
up
the
price
but
that
wouldn't
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
we're
concerned
with
the
criminal
case,
as
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
further
question
of
the
degree
to
which
the
government
may
chop
down
on
a
defendant's
rights
and
that
is
i
would
say
that
we're
up
around
the
realm
of
reasonable
doubt,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
wouldn't
want
to
put
a
quantitative
test
involved
here
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
the
statistics
that
have
been
introduced
here
substantiate
that.
if
the
statistics
do
substantiate
that
to
a
--
with
substantial
assurance,
then
it
is
a
proposition
which
our
cases
would
embrace,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
most
authoritative
judgment
that
has
ever
been
made
about
the
validity
of
these
statistics
was
made
recently
by
the
white
house
conference
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse.
when
it
was
specifically
stated
as
follows,
adequate
data
are
not
available
for
a
precise
estimation
of
the
incidence
and
prevalence
of
the
abuse
of
drugs
with
the
cycle
of
toxic
side
effects
because
addicts
for
the
most
part
obtain
their
drugs
illegally,
the
existing
data
about
unreliable
and
incomplete
and
are
generally
limited
to
individuals
apprehended
by
enforcement
agencies.
the
white
house
panel
necessarily
concluded
the
discrepancies
between
the
federal
state
and
local
enforcement
agencies
are
so
great
in
some
instances,
more
than
100%
that
the
panel
prefers
not
to
make
any
numeral
estimates
at
this
time.
the
time
was
1962,
the
white
house
conference
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
and
the
citation
is
to
page
290
and
291.
indeed,
even
if
one
makes
the
assumption
that
this
court
made
without
determining
the
issue
in
the
leary
case
that
most
heroin
is
imported
to
the
united
states.
one
must
also
look
beyond
that
to
the
question
of
whether,
the
second
part
of
the
presumption
here
at
concern
has
been
found
to
have
a
rational,
have
met
a
rational
test.
that
is
whether
most
users
of
heroin
in
the
united
states
know
that
their
drugs
have
a
foreign
importation.
in
fact,
the
language
used
in
the
leary
case
was
that
a
majority
of
possessors
of
the
narcotic
drug
must
know
of
the
high
rate
of
importation
or
of
the
actual
origin
of
the
drug.
now,
the
government
has
attempted
warmly
i
submit
to
substantiate
that
necessary
showing
of
knowledge
and
it
is
done
at
solely
by
pointing
to
widespread
television
and
newspaper
notoriety.
i
would
submit
that
that
offering
goes
nowhere
near
as
far
as
the
weary
teachers
the
government
must
go.
in
fact,
authoritative
sources
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
show
that
the
heroin
user
by
enlarge
is
poor,
disadvantage,
psychologically
an
escapist
and
far
from
the
sophisticated
person
from
whom
one
might
expect,
the
knowledge
of
the
source
of
importation
of
the
drug.
on
balance
i
submit
that
both
presumptions
of
foreign
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
failed
to
meet
the
rational
connection
test
which
this
court
has
applied.
if
the
court
has
questions,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
am
not
directly
challenging
that
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
well,
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
you
haven't
hesitated
to
do
it
directly
mr.
justice
black
and
i
would
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
submit
that
you
mr.
justice
black
have
not
challenged,
have
not
hesitated
to
take
that
challenge
up
and
that
is
why
you
have
pointed
in
the
past
to
considerations
other
than
those
arguments.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
put
in
that
manner
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
respond
affirmatively
and
indeed,
it's
my
further
contention
as
you
have
pointed
out
in
your
descent
in
gainey,
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
romano
and
in
leary
that
these
presumptions
work
a
depravation
of
due
process
of
law
by
converting
the
reasonable
doubt
test
which
must
be
met,
they
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
trial
by
jury,
in
addition
to
the
self
incriminatory
aspects
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out.
as
a
matter
of
separation
of
powers,
i
would
prefer
to
respond
in
those
terms
that
there
are
substantive
rights
which
statutory
presumptions
must
meet
and
which
these
statutory
presumptions
fail
to
meet.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
my
own
feeling
is
that
there
are
certainly
are
matters
that
judges
may
--
of
which
they
may
take
judicial
notice
but
that
there
are
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
that
process
may
also
operate.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
in
its
operation
i
would
say
it
is
not
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
applied
tests
on
a
case
by
case
basis
on
a
presumption
by
presumption
basis
and
i'm
not
attacking
all
presumptions
here,
i'm
not
attacking
the
presumption
of
recently
stolen
property.
i
am
attacking
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
the
specific
case,
the
same
kind
of
test
which
here
we
ask
for
itself
and
for
any
subsequent
cases
that
may
follow.
i
am
attacking
these
presumption
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
pardon
me.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
he
would
have
so
vitiated
our
constitutional
system
that
at
any
point
thereafter,
the
case
should
be
totally
reversed.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
that
is
correct,
and
he
could
not
be
retried.
i
believed
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
earlier
question,
i
touched
basically
on
most
of
the
additional
points
that
i
would
have
raised.
i
would
only
point
out
that
there
is
one
additional
issue
that
has
been
raised
by
the
amicus
here,
that
is
that
the
operation
of
section
4704
(a)
aside
from
the
statutory
presumption,
the
prohibition
on
any
dealings
in
narcotic
drugs
without
tax
stamps
is
it
self
violation
of
the
self
incrimination
provision.
i
have
referred
to
that,
i
will
refer
to
my
brief
to
page
17
through
20
for
a
fuller
development
of
that
argument.
if
the
court
now
pleases,
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
the
rest
of
our
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
other
issues
in
this
case
beyond
the
issue
of
self
incrimination
arising
from
the
statutory
presumptions
on
which
the
petitioner
for
--
the
petitioner
has
rested.
because
of
the
presence
of
these
issues,
i
have
filed
in
behalf
of
the
amicus
two
briefs
in
this
case
and
i
would
now
like
to
make
this
brief
supplementary
argument.
i
want
a
dwell
on
the
issue
that
was
preserved
in
the
leary
case
last
term,
the
resolution
here,
the
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
statutory
presumption
in
21
usc
section
174
with
respect
to
hard
narcotics.
then
time
permitting,
i
would
like
to
point
briefly
to
the
other
arguments
post
in
the
briefs
of
the
amicus.
the
leary
case
invalidated
the
virtually
identical
statutory
presumption

(a)
similarly
involving
a
statutory
influence
arising
from
mere
possession
of
foreign
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
with
respect
to
marijuana
and
it
has
specifically
left
for
a
future
case
separate
consideration
of
the
similar
question
with
respect
to
hard
drugs.
subsequent
to
the
leary
case
and
in
response
to
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
the
government
has
conceded
error
with
respect
to
the
drug
cocaine
and
has
prayed
for
reversal
on
count
three.
by
so
doing,
it
is
our
position
that
the
government
has
now
dissolved
any
line
remaining
after
leary
between
marijuana
and
hard
drugs.
applying
the
task
of
that
and
prior
cases
to
the
drug
heroin,
the
remaining
drug
in
the
petitioner's
possession.
21
usc
section
174
is
embraced
fully
within
the
prohibition
of
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
has
always
given
deference
to
the
ability
of
congress
to
fashion
evidentiary
rules
but
that
deference
has
always
been
based
and
set
forth
in
the
top
case
on
the
congress's
ability
to
see
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
in
broader
relationship
than
that
might
--
that
might
be
presented
to
the
jury.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
here,
that
what
the
congress
was
doing
in
1909
when
it
passed
the
import
and
export
act
with
respect
to
narcotic
drugs
was
working
a
total
prohibition
on
the
import
and
under
domestic
possession
and
use
of
heroin.
it
was
not
making
a
judgment
of
a
common
relationship
of
facts
such
as
the
congress
was
doing
in
the
statute
which
was
involved
in
gainey
case
and
the
romano
case
26
usc
5601
in
which
it
was
determining
that
because
of
the
tendency
of
steels
to
be
located
in
hidden
places,
that
they
are
maybe
assumed
to
be
in
relationship
with
regard
to
anyone
who
is
found
present
thereat.
therefore,
realizing
that
we
must
look
behind
the
normal
deference
which
is
to
be
accorded
to
the
congress
in
these
matters,
we
must
apply
to
these
presumptions
the
tests
which
have
been
most
recently
stated
in
leary
and
which
have
been
also
stated
in
tot,
those
tests
are
that
there
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
and
evidence
and
the
fact
presumed
there
from.
based
on
a
connection
and
common
experience
and
capable
of
giving
rise
to
substantial
assurance
that
the
presumed
fact
is
more
likely
than
not
to
flow
from
fact
and
evidence.
if
we
apply
this
tests
to
the
possession
here
in
question
both
logically
and
empirically
with
respect
to
21
usc
174,
we
must
come
to
a
conclusion
that
we
cannot
reach
substantial
assurance
that
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
in
evidence
and
the
facts
unlawful
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
which
the
congress
would
have
the
courts
presume.
with
respect
to
unlawful
importation,
there
are
at
least
four
alternatives
for
the
source
of
heroin
in
the
possession
of
the
petitioner.
this
morning,
mr.
straus
made
reference
to
the
statute
21
usc
section
513
by
which
heroin
and
any
other
drug
may
in
fact
be
lawfully
imported
to
the
united
states.
lawfully
imported
for
scientific
purposes
and
for
subsequent
license,
but
i
would
want
that
if
petitioner
turner
and
any
other
possessor
of
heroin
had
come
in
possession
of
such
a
drug
without
such
a
license,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
the
statute.
the
second
source
would
be
lawful
importation
of
source
material
and
subsequent
deviation
and
manufacture
of
that
source
material
into
heroin.
the
source
material
commonly
acknowledged
for
heroin
derived
as
it
is
ultimately
from
the
opium
poppy
is
raw
opium
and
morphine.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
is
also
evidence
which
the
government
does
not
contradict,
indeed
it
confirms
that
codeine
may
also
be
a
source
for
heroin.
using
the
government's
statistics
which
the
government
has
applied
as
the
basis
for
concluding
in
this
case
that
cocaine
may
in
fact
not
be
unlawfully
imported
to
the
united
states,
we
come
to
a
conclusion
that
there
is
a
rather
high
potential
of
domestic
manufacture
of
the
heroin
drug.
the
government
concedes
both
the
possibility
and
the
technical
ease
with
which
heroin
maybe
manufactured.
the
government's
reports
mentioned
efforts
to
manufacture
heroin
and
moreover,
the
government,
both
federal
and
state
have
attempted
to
prosecute
people
for
the
effort
of
manufacturing
heroin
from
source
materials
otherwise
present
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
the
recent
concerns
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
for
cough
syrups
which
have
raw
traces
of
codeine
within
them
and
for
paragor
which
contain
opium
suggest
that
the
source
material
for
the
substance
in
the
possessor
of
heroin's
hands
maybe
as
handy
as
the
local
supermarket
or
drugstore.
the
third
element
which
i
would
suggest
is
present
to
vitiate
the
assurance
of
unlawful
importation
is
that
the
opium
poppy
may
have
been
grown
in
the
united
states.
indeed,
that
prospect
was
itself
the
basis
on
which
congress
passed
the
narcotics
control
acts
in
the
early
part
of
the
century.
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
it
is
agriculturally
possible
to
grow
opium
in
the
united
states.
moreover,
there
is
a
regime
of
federal
control
and
licensing
over
the
opium
poppy
in
the
united
states
and
there
have
been
prosecutions
reported
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
for
individuals
who
have
attempted
to
grow
that
product.
the
government
moreover
in
its
brief
has
also
confirmed
that
there
are
instances
where
opium
is
grown
today
in
the
united
states.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
would
not
apply
mr.
chief
justice
either
a
100%
standard
or
a
51%
standard
to
what
the
government
might
--
must
substantiate.
i
would
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
well,
the
particular
language
with
which
one
may
deal
in
nice
points
is
substantial
assurance
that
more,
that
it
has
more
probably
than
not
come
about
it,
so
i
would
say
even
if
there
were
a
51%
requirement,
one
must
feel
quite
sure
in
fact
to
a
point
that
one
might
speak
of
as
beyond
to
a
moral
certainty
that
the
particular
substance
was
unlawfully
imported
to
the
united
states.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
no,
and
i
don't
ask,
this
one
does.
i
merely
say
that
when
we
think
in
terms
of
the
burden
that
the
government
must
substantiate.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
we're
not
thinking
such
quantitative
terms.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
would
say
your
honor
that
it
does
in
terms
that
tot
uses
strain
one's
tolerance
to
apply
that
test
to
the
substance.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
in
the
light
of
the
showings
which
i'm
making
here
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
the
circumstance.
finally,
i
would
add
that
there
also
is
the
prospect,
that
the
drug
might
be
wholly
synthesized
in
the
united
states
from
sources
which
are
unregulated
and
which
are
commonly
available.
this
possibility
has
been
acknowledged
by
the
government
in
its
briefs.
on
balance,
the
government
has
attempted
to
come
to
grips
with
these
alternatives
and
they
have
concluded
in
their
own
terms
that
if
heroin
is
available
in
the
united
states
domestically
manufactured
and
produced,
that
the
likelihood
is
less
than
1%.
i
would
point
out
that
first
of
all,
one
must
be
aware
when
one
judges
the
validity
of
this
projection
of
the
sources
from
which
the
government's
data
are
drawn.
those
sources
can
only
be
in
this
circumstances,
the
list
and
the
numbers
and
quantities
of
drugs
that
have
been
confiscated
at
ports
and
borders
and
those
that
may
have
been
confiscated
overseas.
and
these
by
this
very
basis
i
would
submit
have
absolutely
no
basis
as
a
rational
source
of
inference
for
any
substance
that
maybe
domestically
produced.
the
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
it
--
it
might,
on
the
other
hand
it
might
also
raise
the
incentive
for
local
manufacture
your
honor
by
driving
up
the
price
but
that
wouldn't
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
we're
concerned
with
the
criminal
case,
as
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
further
question
of
the
degree
to
which
the
government
may
chop
down
on
a
defendant's
rights
and
that
is
i
would
say
that
we're
up
around
the
realm
of
reasonable
doubt,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
wouldn't
want
to
put
a
quantitative
test
involved
here
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
the
statistics
that
have
been
introduced
here
substantiate
that.
if
the
statistics
do
substantiate
that
to
a
--
with
substantial
assurance,
then
it
is
a
proposition
which
our
cases
would
embrace,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
most
authoritative
judgment
that
has
ever
been
made
about
the
validity
of
these
statistics
was
made
recently
by
the
white
house
conference
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse.
when
it
was
specifically
stated
as
follows,
adequate
data
are
not
available
for
a
precise
estimation
of
the
incidence
and
prevalence
of
the
abuse
of
drugs
with
the
cycle
of
toxic
side
effects
because
addicts
for
the
most
part
obtain
their
drugs
illegally,
the
existing
data
about
unreliable
and
incomplete
and
are
generally
limited
to
individuals
apprehended
by
enforcement
agencies.
the
white
house
panel
necessarily
concluded
the
discrepancies
between
the
federal
state
and
local
enforcement
agencies
are
so
great
in
some
instances,
more
than
100%
that
the
panel
prefers
not
to
make
any
numeral
estimates
at
this
time.
the
time
was
1962,
the
white
house
conference
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
and
the
citation
is
to
page
290
and
291.
indeed,
even
if
one
makes
the
assumption
that
this
court
made
without
determining
the
issue
in
the
leary
case
that
most
heroin
is
imported
to
the
united
states.
one
must
also
look
beyond
that
to
the
question
of
whether,
the
second
part
of
the
presumption
here
at
concern
has
been
found
to
have
a
rational,
have
met
a
rational
test.
that
is
whether
most
users
of
heroin
in
the
united
states
know
that
their
drugs
have
a
foreign
importation.
in
fact,
the
language
used
in
the
leary
case
was
that
a
majority
of
possessors
of
the
narcotic
drug
must
know
of
the
high
rate
of
importation
or
of
the
actual
origin
of
the
drug.
now,
the
government
has
attempted
warmly
i
submit
to
substantiate
that
necessary
showing
of
knowledge
and
it
is
done
at
solely
by
pointing
to
widespread
television
and
newspaper
notoriety.
i
would
submit
that
that
offering
goes
nowhere
near
as
far
as
the
weary
teachers
the
government
must
go.
in
fact,
authoritative
sources
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
show
that
the
heroin
user
by
enlarge
is
poor,
disadvantage,
psychologically
an
escapist
and
far
from
the
sophisticated
person
from
whom
one
might
expect,
the
knowledge
of
the
source
of
importation
of
the
drug.
on
balance
i
submit
that
both
presumptions
of
foreign
importation
and
knowledge
thereof
failed
to
meet
the
rational
connection
test
which
this
court
has
applied.
if
the
court
has
questions,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
am
not
directly
challenging
that
your
honor,
i
have
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
well,
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
you
haven't
hesitated
to
do
it
directly
mr.
justice
black
and
i
would
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
i
submit
that
you
mr.
justice
black
have
not
challenged,
have
not
hesitated
to
take
that
challenge
up
and
that
is
why
you
have
pointed
in
the
past
to
considerations
other
than
those
arguments.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
put
in
that
manner
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
respond
affirmatively
and
indeed,
it's
my
further
contention
as
you
have
pointed
out
in
your
descent
in
gainey,
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
romano
and
in
leary
that
these
presumptions
work
a
depravation
of
due
process
of
law
by
converting
the
reasonable
doubt
test
which
must
be
met,
they
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
trial
by
jury,
in
addition
to
the
self
incriminatory
aspects
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out.
as
a
matter
of
separation
of
powers,
i
would
prefer
to
respond
in
those
terms
that
there
are
substantive
rights
which
statutory
presumptions
must
meet
and
which
these
statutory
presumptions
fail
to
meet.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
my
own
feeling
is
that
there
are
certainly
are
matters
that
judges
may
--
of
which
they
may
take
judicial
notice
but
that
there
are
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
that
process
may
also
operate.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
in
its
operation
i
would
say
it
is
not
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
applied
tests
on
a
case
by
case
basis
on
a
presumption
by
presumption
basis
and
i'm
not
attacking
all
presumptions
here,
i'm
not
attacking
the
presumption
of
recently
stolen
property.
i
am
attacking
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
the
specific
case,
the
same
kind
of
test
which
here
we
ask
for
itself
and
for
any
subsequent
cases
that
may
follow.
i
am
attacking
these
presumption
--
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
pardon
me.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
he
would
have
so
vitiated
our
constitutional
system
that
at
any
point
thereafter,
the
case
should
be
totally
reversed.
mr.
steven
r.
rivkin
that
is
correct,
and
he
could
not
be
retried.
i
believed
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
earlier
question,
i
touched
basically
on
most
of
the
additional
points
that
i
would
have
raised.
i
would
only
point
out
that
there
is
one
additional
issue
that
has
been
raised
by
the
amicus
here,
that
is
that
the
operation
of
section
4704
(a)
aside
from
the
statutory
presumption,
the
prohibition
on
any
dealings
in
narcotic
drugs
without
tax
stamps
is
it
self
violation
of
the
self
incrimination
provision.
i
have
referred
to
that,
i
will
refer
to
my
brief
to
page
17
through
20
for
a
fuller
development
of
that
argument.
if
the
court
now
pleases,
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
the
rest
of
our
argument
for
rebuttal.
