justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
although
i
--
as
i
remember
it
i
joined
the
very
opinion
as
said
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
if
you
show
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
you
have
shown
but
let
us
assume
in
your
submission
that
that
the
fact
is
that
the
lion
share
of
all
heroin
in
the
united
states
is
illegally
imported.
i
--
i
don't
see
at
the
moment
how
it
does
follow
as
matter
of
common
sense
that
anybody
knows
that.
the
fact
is
i
didn't
know
it
until
these
cases
came
along.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
assume
i
now
accept
that
part
of
the
introduction
but
how
does
it
follow
that
everybody
knows
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
not
suggested
that
he
necessarily
or
people
similarly
situated
go
down
to
the
pier
and
get
it
illegally
off
the
ship
or
go
out
to
the
airport
and
get
it
illegally
off
the
airplane,
if
there
is
an
internal
commerce
in
this
product
i
assume.
and
why
does
it
follow
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
he,
the
person,
he
may
know
he's
violating,
he
does
know
he's
violating
the
law
but
nothing,
how
does
it
follow
that
he
knows
or
should
be
presumed
or
sure
that
there
should
be
an
inference
that
he
knows
that
this
is
in
all
probability
has
been
illegally
imported?
justice
potter
stewart
a
practical
result
of
your,
of
that
concession
would
be
i
hear
submission
plot
that
we,
just
that
automatically
five
years
come
off
of
this
total
sentence
or
that
the
court
if
in
case
we
agree
on
the
rest
of
your
argument
or
that
the
court
remand
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
re-sentence
entirely?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it
would
eliminate
a
10
year
sentence
which
is
running
concurrently
with
the
five
year
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
be
it,
practically
it
would
reduce
a
total
20
year
sentence
to
a
total
of
15
years
sentence?
