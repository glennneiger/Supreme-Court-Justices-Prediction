in
the
--
in
rebuttal?
or
as
part
of
your
argument's
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
arranged
to
see
that
he
doesn't
absorb
all
your
rebuttal
time?
chief

e.

very
well,
we'll
leave
it
up
to
your
gentlemen.
chief

e.

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
government
or
the
congress
in
order
to
establish
this
presumption
must
negate
every
possible
source
or
is
the
presumption
supportable
if
on
balance
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
it's
an
imported
substance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
definition
earlier
was
more
probable
than
that,
i
wouldn't
--
how
far
do
you
go
than
on
the
percentages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
any
case
ever
held
that
it
had
to
be
to
a
moral
certainty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
this
presumption,
statutory
presumption
here
is
more
or
less
offensive
than
the
common
law
presumption
which
is
enacted
in
the
statute
in
some
states
arising
from
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
unexplained
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
could
live
with
the
other,
the
common
law
presumption
but
you
think
that's
not
as
offensive
as
the
statutory
presumption
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
congress
has
no
such
right
to
establish
standards
of
proof,
does
that
in
any
way
inhibit
judges
from
applying
a
standard
which
congress
may
have
incidentally
defined
if
judges
think
its
insensible
standard
as
they
have
with
reference
to
the
inference
as
to
be
drawn
from
possession
of
recently
stolen
property?
judges
can
adopt
it
on
their
own
not
be
concerned
that
the
congress
has
prescribed,
can't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
this
presumption
here
fundamentally
very
much
different
from
the
inferences
which
the
courts
permit
juries
to
draw
from
possession
of
recently
stolen
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well

there

there
had
been
cases
where

of
chemistry

other

in

have
been
tendered
by
the

is
that
not
so?
chief

yes.
