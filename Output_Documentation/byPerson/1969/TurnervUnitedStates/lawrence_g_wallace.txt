mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
stands
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
four
counts
of
narcotics
violation
and
he
petitioned
this
court
to
review
the
constitutional
validity
as
applied
to
him
of
the
so
called
statutory
presumptions
of
the
two
federal
narcotics
laws
under
which
he
was
convicted.
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumptions
was
the
only
question
he
put
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
the
only
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
our
view
of
the
case
under
this
court's
rules
therefore,
no
other
issues
are
raised
apart
from
the
validity
of
the
presumptions
and
that
is
what
we
have
directed
our
brief
to
and
what
i
anticipate
directing
the
argument
to.
because
no
other
issues
are
raised,
the
facts
of
record
pertinent
in
this
court
are
few
but
i
think
they
are
worth
reviewing
for
purposes
of
addressing
ourselves
to
the
trial
judges
charge
to
the
jury
as
well
as
to
the
validity
of
applying
the
presumptions
in
this
case.
federal
narcotics
agents
arrested
the
petitioner
and
two
traveling
companions
at
a
lincoln
tunnel
tow
booth
in
new
jersey
shortly
after
their
automobile
emerged
in
the
course
of
the
trip
from
new
york
city
and
the
automobile
was
registered
in
petitioner's
name.
while
the
agents
were
conducting
a
search
of
the
arrested
individual
and
prior
to
their
actual
search
of
petitioner's
person,
he
threw
a
metal
foil
package
containing
cocaine
to
the
top
of
the
nearby
wall
and
in
search
of
the
automobile
then
revealed
another
metal
foil
package
containing
heroin
under
the
front
seat.
the
first
package
weighed
14
and
2/3
grams
and
contained
a
mixture
of
cocaine
and
sugar,
5%
of
which
was
cocaine.
the
package
containing
heroin
weighed
48
and
a
quarter
grams
and
consisted
of
a
mixture
of
several
substances,
15.2%
of
which
was
heroin.
the
heroin
mixture
was
divided
into
275
small
glisten
double
bags
all
wrapped
within
the
metal
foil
package
and
none
of
the
containers
had
any
tax
stamps
affixed.
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
heroin
violation
and
of
a
cocaine
violation
under
each
of
the
two
statutes
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
under
section
174
of
title
21,
he
was
convicted
of
having
knowingly
received,
concealed
and
facilitated
the
transportation
of
each
drug
after
its
illegal
importation
with
knowledge
that
it
had
been
illegally
imported.
under
section
4704
(a)
of
title
26,
he
was
convicted
of
having
knowingly
purchased,
possess
and
distributed
each
drug
not
in
or
from
the
original
stamp
package.
he
was
given
concurrent
sentences
of
imprisonment
under
two
heroin
counts
to
run
consecutively
with
concurrence
sentences
under
two
cocaine
counts.
under
each
of
these
statutes,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
in
the
statutory
language
that
under
section
174,
excuse
me,
it
was
authorized
to
convict
if
the
defendant
was
shown
to
have
been
in
possession
of
the
drug
and
has
not
explained
his
possession
to
the
jury's
satisfaction
and
under
section
4704,
it
was
authorized
to
convict
if
the
drug
were
shown
to
be
in
the
defendant's
possession
without
appropriate
tax
stamps
affixed.
these
so-called
statutory
presumptions
authorized
but
did
not
require
the
jury
the
infer
the
additional
elements
of
each
crime
from
the
government's
proof
in
this
case
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
apply
these
presumptions
to
each
of
the
four
counts.
the
issue
is
not
a
novel
one
in
this
court
because
the
constitutionality
of
each
of
these
statutory
presumptions
has
previously
been
upheld
in
this
court's
decisions,
that
of
section
174
in
yee
hem
against
the
united
states
in
volume
268
us
and
that
of
section
4704
(a)
in
casey
against
the
united
state
in
volume
276
us.
in
a
series
of
more
recent
decisions
beginning
with
tot
against
the
united
states
and
continuing
through
gainey
and
romano
and
most
recently
last
terms
decisions
in
leary,
the
court
has
more
searchingly
analyzed
and
refined
the
standard
for
determining
the
constitutional
validity
of
criminal
statutory
presumptions.
a
consistent
theme
of
all
of
these
decisions
is
that
a
distinction
may
legitimately
be
made
between
the
evidence
relating
to
a
particular
defendant
and
the
question
of
what
inferences
in
general
may
properly
be
drawn
from
the
proof
of
certain
facts
and
that
as
to
the
latter
issue.
congress
may
properly
bring
to
bear
its
resources
and
its
wisdom
may
bring
to
bear
what
this
court
in
gainey
referred
to
as
the
capacity
of
congress
to
amass
the
stop
of
actual
experience
and
call
conclusions
from
it.
so
as
to
provide
statutory
guides
that
will
contribute
to
consistency
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
that
will
in
most
cases
enable
the
trial
to
be
focused
on
the
evidence
relating
to
the
particular
defendant
without
the
destruction
and
the
burden
of
introducing
proof
in
every
case
concerning
complex
matters
of
general
application
such
as
the
details
amass
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
about
the
narcotics
trade
in
general
and
its
possible
relation
to
the
scientific
properties
of
various
drugs.
now
of
course,
congress
has
not
foreclosed
either
party
from
introducing
expert
testimony
or
other
evidence
tending
in
general
to
vitiate
or
to
substantiate
statutory
presumptions
but
this
is
rarely
done.
now,
in
the
series
of
cases
i
mentioned,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
admit
it
because
congress
has
not
attempted
to
foreclose
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
series
of
cases
i
mentioned,
this
court
has
developed
the
standard
for
testing
the
constitutionality
of
criminal
statutory
presumptions
in
terms
whether
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
the
ultimate
fact
presumed
or
as
it
was
re-stated
last
term
in
leary,
a
criminal
statutory
presumption
must
be
regarded
as
irrational
or
arbitrary
and
hence
unconstitutional
unless
it
can
be
at
least
said
with
substantial
assurance
that
the
presumed
fact
is
more
likely
than
not
to
flow
from
the
proved
fact
on
which
it
is
made
to
depend.
under
this
standard,
we
contend
as
to
three
of
the
counts
here
that
the
application
of
the
presumptions
was
rational
and
as
to
the
remaining
count
under
which
petitioner
was
convicted,
we
can
see
that
this
requirement
was
not
match
and
that
petitioner's
conviction
under
that
count
should
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
as
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
did
put
the
case
to
the
jury
but
they
had
to
be
convinced
by
the
government's
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
had
been
made
out.
and
the
statutory
presumptions
are
just
another
form
of
recognizing
that
circumstantial
evidence
can
be
put
to
the
jury
under
proper
reasonable
doubt
instructions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
way
the
indictment
was
phrased,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that's
the
law
under
this
court's
decisions,
indictments
always
have
to
be
phrased
in
the
conjunctive
rather
than
in
the
alternative
and
that
if
any
of
the
crimes
are
made
out,
that
is
sufficient
to
uphold
the
conviction.
it
is
possible
to
phrase
â€“-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
indictment
always
say
and
because
if
indictment
say
or,
it
is
been
held
that
that
doesn't
give
the
defendant
adequate
warning
of
what
the
government
will
try
to
prove
against
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
some
of
this
could
have
been
omitted
from
the
indictment
but
that
again
is
an
issue
that
is
not
raised
here
at
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
he
purchased
the
cocaine
not
in
or
from
a
stamp
package
and
that
is
included
within
the
indictment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
we
further
urge
that
except
as
it
may
serve
to
raise
a
belated
challenge
to
the
trial
court's
instructions,
petitioners
rely
on
some
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
in
challenging
the
presumptions
should
be
regarded
in
this
case
as
not
really
adding
anything
to
the
established
rational
connection
task
of
their
validity
and
since
we
also
contend
that
the
jury
instructions
were
adequate,
we
conclude
that
the
verdict
of
guilty
should
be
sustained
as
to
the
three
counts
in
which
the
statutory
presumptions
were
rationally
applied.
returning
first
to
the
two
heroin
counts,
we
contend
that
both
statutory
presumptions
were
validly
applied
to
the
evidence
of
possession
of
that
drug,
under
section
174,
it
was
rational
for
the
jury
to
conclude
from
petitioners
possession
of
the
275
bags
of
heroin,
both
that
the
heroin
was
illegally
imported
and
the
petitioner
knew
of
its
illegal
importation.
we
have
documented
in
our
brief
and
in
our
supplemental
memorandum
the
reasons
why
in
contrast
to
the
facts
concerning
marijuana
which
were
before
this
court
last
term
in
leary,
on
the
basis
of
the
best
information
available,
available
within
the
government,
available
in
scientific
publications,
available
on
the
reports
of
the
united
nation's
commission
on
narcotic
drugs
and
available
in
the
recent
report
of
the
task
force
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
of
the
president's
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
administration
of
justice.
the
first
part
of
this
presumption
that
the
heroin
was
illegally
imported
should
be
regarded
as
simply
reflecting
the
actuality
that
heroin
is
neither
produced
in,
or
illegally
imported
into
the
united
states.
we
have
in
that
written
presentation
carefully
considered
and
responded
every
speculative
possibility
commendably
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
amicus
in
this
case
as
an
alternative
source
to
illegal
importation
and
we
have
demonstrated
that
none
of
these
alternatives
could
realistically
account
for
more
than
a
negligible
fraction
of
the
total
supply
of
heroin
in
this
country.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
virtually
all
and
at
least
99%
of
the
heroin
in
the
united
states
was
illegally
imported.
it
then
follows
in
the
words
of
the
leary
opinion
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
since
all
heroin
is
illegally
imported
or
virtually
all,
a
jury
may
rationally
infer
and
thus
maybe
authorized
by
congress
to
infer
that
a
person
in
possession
of
275
bags
of
heroin
knows
that
it
was
illegally
imported.
the
drawing
of
such
inference
by
the
jury
from
the
conduct
of
the
accused
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
is
after
all
the
ordinary
way
in
accusatorial
system
of
justice
in
which
it
is
determined
whether
the
accused
have
the
requisite
knowledge
or
other
mental
attributes
such
as
specific
intent
when
such
a
mental
attribute
is
an
element
of
a
crime.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
this
court's
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
this
court's
decisions
mr.
justice
black,
the
tasks
of
whether
congress
can
authorize
the
jury
so
to
find
is
whether
it
would
be
rational
of
for
the
jury
to
do
so.
now,
i
recognize
that
once
one
accepts
your
premises
to
separation
of
powers
in
this
area,
the
internal
logic
of
your
position
is
indisputable
but
the
majority
of
the
court
has
not
accepted
that
premise
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
--
i'm
addressing
my
argument
in
terms
of
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
petitioner
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
petitioner
is
not
any
body,
the
petitioner
was
someone
found
with
275
bags
of
heroin
in
his
possession
and
he
is
comparable
perhaps
to
a
dealer
in
rolls
royce
automobiles.
i
--i
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
the
jury
might
infer
that
someone
dealing
in
a
product
or
found
in
circumstances
which
suggest
that
he
is
dealing
in
a
product
knows
more
about
that
product
than
someone
who
doesn't
deal
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
one
is
knowledgeable
about
heroin,
this
is,
he
would
know
that
all
heroin
in
this
country
has
an
illegal
foreign
origin
and
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense
the
jury
might
infer
that
the
dealer
is
knowledgeable
about
the
product
in
which
he
is
dealing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
evidence,
no,
no.
the
evidence
is
that
he
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
possible
but
he
is
connected
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
with
the
operation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
has
seen
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
any
event,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
make
knowledge
of
illegal
importation
and
element
of
the
crime
and
to
give
an
opportunity
to
someone
to
prove
his
innocence
by
proving
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
illegal
importation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statute
was
an
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
just
by
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
submitting
his
testimony
to
the
jury
and
seeing
if
they
would
believe
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
could
disclaim
knowledge
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
originative
of
narcotics?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless
he
had
some
witness
who
is
willing
to
swear
to
some
evidence
other
than
hearsay,
it
can
be
conceived
that
would
indicate
that
he
was
knowledgeable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
but
there
is
nothing
to
foreclose
such
evidence
from
being
introduced.
but
in
any
event,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
his
reference
to
the
principle
that
possession
of
the
fruits
of
crime
recently
after
his
commission
justifies
an
influence
that
the
possession
is
guilty
possession.
but
knowledge
is
frequently
of
it
inferred
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
situations
comparable
to
that
contemplated
by
this
statute
and
this
is
widely
done
in
both
state
and
federal
law,
for
example
in
the
enforcement
of
the
national
motor
vehicle
fastback,
the
so
called
direct.
and
in
the
words
this
court
used
in
gainey
for
congress
to
authorized
the
jury
to
do
this
is
to
authorize
it
to
do
no
more
than
accord
to
the
evidence
if
unexplained,
its
natural
prohibitive
force.
we
also
contend
that
the
presumption
in
the
tax
stamp
statute
was
validly
applied
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
heroin
since
as
we
have
documented
in
our
brief,
heroin
is
not
available
in
tax
stamp
packages,
there
is
no
way
petitioner
could
have
procured
it
in
or
from
the
original
stamp
package
and
it
follows
that
congress
constitutionally
could
authorize
the
jury
to
infer
from
his
possession
of
the
heroin
that
he
had
purchased
it
in
violation
of
the
tax
stamps
statute
which
in
contrast
to
section
174
does
not
include
specific
knowledge
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
as
to
the
cocaine
counts,
we
first
concede
that
the
application
of
the
section
174
presumption
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
relatively
small
amount
of
cocaine
involved
in
this
case
was
not
warranted
under
the
constitutional
standard,
explained
and
applied
last
term
in
leary.
this
is
because
in
contrast
to
heroin,
there
are
as
indicated
in
our
brief
and
its
appendix,
substantial
quantities
of
cocaine
stolen
from
legitimate
sources
in
this
country
every
year
while
comparison
of
these
figures
with
the
admittedly
rough
estimates
set
forth
in
the
footnote
on
page
31
of
our
brief
of
the
quantities
of
cocaine
annually
smuggled
into
this
country
might
justify
an
inference
that
the
cocaine
found
in
the
elicit
trade
was
in
fact
was
illegally
imported.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
further
inference
of
knowledge
of
its
illegal
importation
meets
the
leary
standard
in
such
a
case
as
the
present
one
involving
less
than
Â¾
of
a
gram
of
cocaine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
the
latter
mr.
justice.
it
--
otherwise
the
reversal
just
eliminates
the
part
of
the
concurring
sentence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
either
alternative
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
presumably
and
i
think
either
would
be
an
acceptable
procedure.
so,
we
do
not
contend
that
this
conviction
met
the
leary
standard
but
in
conceding
this,
we
do
contend
that
this
court
need
not
and
should
not
now
decide
whether
the
section
174
presumption
could
validly
be
applied
to
possession
of
cocaine
in
an
amount
so
large
as
not
reasonably
likely
to
have
been
aggregated
from
individual
thefts
or
in
other
circumstances
pointing
to
a
foreign
source,
there
is
no
necessity
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
presumption
can
ever
bail
or
it
be
implied.
we
urge
on
the
other
hand
that
the
tax
stamp
presumption
was
validly
applied
to
position
--
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
cocaine
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
we've
elaborated
in
our
brief.
turning
now
to
petitioner's
claims
based
on
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
we
recognize
that
when
a
statutory
presumption
is
applied
without
adequate
rational
foundation
as
we
concede
was
the
case
as
to
one
count
here,
one
way
of
articulating
the
constitutional
infirmity
is
to
say
that
so
applied,
the
presumption
impermissibly
impaired
the
defendant's
right
to
remain
silent
and
thus
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
when
however
such
a
presumption
is
applied
in
compliance
with
the
standard
of
rationality
established
by
this
court,
then
the
alleged
coercion
to
testify
stands
not
from
any
unconstitutional
compulsion
but
from
the
legitimate
force
of
the
government's
case.
it
is
not
uncommon
in
a
criminal
trial
for
the
defendant
to
be
faced
with
evidence
justifying
a
rational
inference
of
guilt
and
to
have
to
decide
whether
despite
attended
risks
of
doing
so,
he
will
testify
an
effort
to
overcome
the
force
of
that
evidence.
there
is
no
reason
relevant
to
the
policies
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
for
holding
that
the
status
of
such
a
defendant
differs
depending
on
whether
the
jury's
inference
of
guilt
is
authorized
by
judge
made
rule
of
evidence
or
by
a
rationally
warranted
statutory
provision.
in
either
instance
as
the
gainey
opinion
recognized,
the
courts
have
the
same
responsibility
to
decide
whether
the
government
has
made
a
submissible
case.
and
if
the
government's
evidence
meet
that
standard
and
we
contend
it
did
hear
with
respect
to
three
counts,
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
does
not
violate
the
constitutional
privilege
as
this
court
definitively
held
in
yee
hem
against
the
united
states,
and
the
passage
quoted
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
turning
finally
to
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
although
petitioner
did
not
accept
to
them
at
the
trial
and
did
not
request
that
the
jury
be
charged
not
to
draw
any
adverse
inference
from
his
failure
to
testify,
he
now
contends
that
the
reading
of
the
statutory
inferences
to
the
jury
in
the
course
of
the
instructions
constituted
adverse
comment
on
his
silence.
now,
substantially
the
same
contention
was
properly
rejected
by
this
court
in
gainey
in
which
very
similar
instructions
to
the
jury
were
upheld
in
a
situation
involving
a
similar
statutory
presumption.
now,
its
true
that
there
are
passages
in
the
instructions
which
were
read
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
which
have
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
trial
in
which
the
matter
put
in
issue
by
the
defense
was
the
question
of
possession,
that
was
what
they
were
contesting
at
trial
and
naturally,
the
trial
judge
emphasized
to
the
jury
that
that
was
a
crucial
issue
for
them
to
decide.
but
here
as
in
gainey,
at
reading
the
instruction
as
a
whole,
the
jury
was
merely
permitted
to
draw
rational
inferences
from
the
unexplained
circumstantial
evidence
presented
by
the
government
and
the
jury
was
specifically
admonished
that
they
were
to
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
judges
of
the
facts
and
that
the
burden
of
proving
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
on
the
government
not
withstanding
the
statutory
presumptions.
while
it
might
have
been
better
practice
as
the
gainey
opinion
suggest
to
omit
from
the
charge
any
explicit
reference
to
the
statutory
provisions
authorizing
the
inferences,
the
instructions
as
given
were
adequate
specially
in
the
absence
of
an
exception
and
do
not
differ
significantly
from
those
upheld
in
gainey.
it
is
therefore
our
position
that
accept
as
to
count
three,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
upholding
the
jury
verdict.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
stands
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
on
four
counts
of
narcotics
violation
and
he
petitioned
this
court
to
review
the
constitutional
validity
as
applied
to
him
of
the
so
called
statutory
presumptions
of
the
two
federal
narcotics
laws
under
which
he
was
convicted.
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumptions
was
the
only
question
he
put
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
the
only
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
our
view
of
the
case
under
this
court's
rules
therefore,
no
other
issues
are
raised
apart
from
the
validity
of
the
presumptions
and
that
is
what
we
have
directed
our
brief
to
and
what
i
anticipate
directing
the
argument
to.
because
no
other
issues
are
raised,
the
facts
of
record
pertinent
in
this
court
are
few
but
i
think
they
are
worth
reviewing
for
purposes
of
addressing
ourselves
to
the
trial
judges
charge
to
the
jury
as
well
as
to
the
validity
of
applying
the
presumptions
in
this
case.
federal
narcotics
agents
arrested
the
petitioner
and
two
traveling
companions
at
a
lincoln
tunnel
tow
booth
in
new
jersey
shortly
after
their
automobile
emerged
in
the
course
of
the
trip
from
new
york
city
and
the
automobile
was
registered
in
petitioner's
name.
while
the
agents
were
conducting
a
search
of
the
arrested
individual
and
prior
to
their
actual
search
of
petitioner's
person,
he
threw
a
metal
foil
package
containing
cocaine
to
the
top
of
the
nearby
wall
and
in
search
of
the
automobile
then
revealed
another
metal
foil
package
containing
heroin
under
the
front
seat.
the
first
package
weighed
14
and
2/3
grams
and
contained
a
mixture
of
cocaine
and
sugar,
5%
of
which
was
cocaine.
the
package
containing
heroin
weighed
48
and
a
quarter
grams
and
consisted
of
a
mixture
of
several
substances,
15.2%
of
which
was
heroin.
the
heroin
mixture
was
divided
into
275
small
glisten
double
bags
all
wrapped
within
the
metal
foil
package
and
none
of
the
containers
had
any
tax
stamps
affixed.
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
heroin
violation
and
of
a
cocaine
violation
under
each
of
the
two
statutes
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
under
section
174
of
title
21,
he
was
convicted
of
having
knowingly
received,
concealed
and
facilitated
the
transportation
of
each
drug
after
its
illegal
importation
with
knowledge
that
it
had
been
illegally
imported.
under
section
4704
(a)
of
title
26,
he
was
convicted
of
having
knowingly
purchased,
possess
and
distributed
each
drug
not
in
or
from
the
original
stamp
package.
he
was
given
concurrent
sentences
of
imprisonment
under
two
heroin
counts
to
run
consecutively
with
concurrence
sentences
under
two
cocaine
counts.
under
each
of
these
statutes,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
in
the
statutory
language
that
under
section
174,
excuse
me,
it
was
authorized
to
convict
if
the
defendant
was
shown
to
have
been
in
possession
of
the
drug
and
has
not
explained
his
possession
to
the
jury's
satisfaction
and
under
section
4704,
it
was
authorized
to
convict
if
the
drug
were
shown
to
be
in
the
defendant's
possession
without
appropriate
tax
stamps
affixed.
these
so-called
statutory
presumptions
authorized
but
did
not
require
the
jury
the
infer
the
additional
elements
of
each
crime
from
the
government's
proof
in
this
case
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
apply
these
presumptions
to
each
of
the
four
counts.
the
issue
is
not
a
novel
one
in
this
court
because
the
constitutionality
of
each
of
these
statutory
presumptions
has
previously
been
upheld
in
this
court's
decisions,
that
of
section
174
in
yee
hem
against
the
united
states
in
volume
268
us
and
that
of
section
4704
(a)
in
casey
against
the
united
state
in
volume
276
us.
in
a
series
of
more
recent
decisions
beginning
with
tot
against
the
united
states
and
continuing
through
gainey
and
romano
and
most
recently
last
terms
decisions
in
leary,
the
court
has
more
searchingly
analyzed
and
refined
the
standard
for
determining
the
constitutional
validity
of
criminal
statutory
presumptions.
a
consistent
theme
of
all
of
these
decisions
is
that
a
distinction
may
legitimately
be
made
between
the
evidence
relating
to
a
particular
defendant
and
the
question
of
what
inferences
in
general
may
properly
be
drawn
from
the
proof
of
certain
facts
and
that
as
to
the
latter
issue.
congress
may
properly
bring
to
bear
its
resources
and
its
wisdom
may
bring
to
bear
what
this
court
in
gainey
referred
to
as
the
capacity
of
congress
to
amass
the
stop
of
actual
experience
and
call
conclusions
from
it.
so
as
to
provide
statutory
guides
that
will
contribute
to
consistency
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
that
will
in
most
cases
enable
the
trial
to
be
focused
on
the
evidence
relating
to
the
particular
defendant
without
the
destruction
and
the
burden
of
introducing
proof
in
every
case
concerning
complex
matters
of
general
application
such
as
the
details
amass
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
about
the
narcotics
trade
in
general
and
its
possible
relation
to
the
scientific
properties
of
various
drugs.
now
of
course,
congress
has
not
foreclosed
either
party
from
introducing
expert
testimony
or
other
evidence
tending
in
general
to
vitiate
or
to
substantiate
statutory
presumptions
but
this
is
rarely
done.
now,
in
the
series
of
cases
i
mentioned,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
need
not
admit
it
because
congress
has
not
attempted
to
foreclose
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
series
of
cases
i
mentioned,
this
court
has
developed
the
standard
for
testing
the
constitutionality
of
criminal
statutory
presumptions
in
terms
whether
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
the
ultimate
fact
presumed
or
as
it
was
re-stated
last
term
in
leary,
a
criminal
statutory
presumption
must
be
regarded
as
irrational
or
arbitrary
and
hence
unconstitutional
unless
it
can
be
at
least
said
with
substantial
assurance
that
the
presumed
fact
is
more
likely
than
not
to
flow
from
the
proved
fact
on
which
it
is
made
to
depend.
under
this
standard,
we
contend
as
to
three
of
the
counts
here
that
the
application
of
the
presumptions
was
rational
and
as
to
the
remaining
count
under
which
petitioner
was
convicted,
we
can
see
that
this
requirement
was
not
match
and
that
petitioner's
conviction
under
that
count
should
be
reversed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
as
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
did
put
the
case
to
the
jury
but
they
had
to
be
convinced
by
the
government's
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
had
been
made
out.
and
the
statutory
presumptions
are
just
another
form
of
recognizing
that
circumstantial
evidence
can
be
put
to
the
jury
under
proper
reasonable
doubt
instructions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
way
the
indictment
was
phrased,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that's
the
law
under
this
court's
decisions,
indictments
always
have
to
be
phrased
in
the
conjunctive
rather
than
in
the
alternative
and
that
if
any
of
the
crimes
are
made
out,
that
is
sufficient
to
uphold
the
conviction.
it
is
possible
to
phrase
â€“-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
indictment
always
say
and
because
if
indictment
say
or,
it
is
been
held
that
that
doesn't
give
the
defendant
adequate
warning
of
what
the
government
will
try
to
prove
against
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
some
of
this
could
have
been
omitted
from
the
indictment
but
that
again
is
an
issue
that
is
not
raised
here
at
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
he
purchased
the
cocaine
not
in
or
from
a
stamp
package
and
that
is
included
within
the
indictment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
we
further
urge
that
except
as
it
may
serve
to
raise
a
belated
challenge
to
the
trial
court's
instructions,
petitioners
rely
on
some
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
in
challenging
the
presumptions
should
be
regarded
in
this
case
as
not
really
adding
anything
to
the
established
rational
connection
task
of
their
validity
and
since
we
also
contend
that
the
jury
instructions
were
adequate,
we
conclude
that
the
verdict
of
guilty
should
be
sustained
as
to
the
three
counts
in
which
the
statutory
presumptions
were
rationally
applied.
returning
first
to
the
two
heroin
counts,
we
contend
that
both
statutory
presumptions
were
validly
applied
to
the
evidence
of
possession
of
that
drug,
under
section
174,
it
was
rational
for
the
jury
to
conclude
from
petitioners
possession
of
the
275
bags
of
heroin,
both
that
the
heroin
was
illegally
imported
and
the
petitioner
knew
of
its
illegal
importation.
we
have
documented
in
our
brief
and
in
our
supplemental
memorandum
the
reasons
why
in
contrast
to
the
facts
concerning
marijuana
which
were
before
this
court
last
term
in
leary,
on
the
basis
of
the
best
information
available,
available
within
the
government,
available
in
scientific
publications,
available
on
the
reports
of
the
united
nation's
commission
on
narcotic
drugs
and
available
in
the
recent
report
of
the
task
force
on
narcotics
and
drug
abuse
of
the
president's
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
administration
of
justice.
the
first
part
of
this
presumption
that
the
heroin
was
illegally
imported
should
be
regarded
as
simply
reflecting
the
actuality
that
heroin
is
neither
produced
in,
or
illegally
imported
into
the
united
states.
we
have
in
that
written
presentation
carefully
considered
and
responded
every
speculative
possibility
commendably
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
amicus
in
this
case
as
an
alternative
source
to
illegal
importation
and
we
have
demonstrated
that
none
of
these
alternatives
could
realistically
account
for
more
than
a
negligible
fraction
of
the
total
supply
of
heroin
in
this
country.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
virtually
all
and
at
least
99%
of
the
heroin
in
the
united
states
was
illegally
imported.
it
then
follows
in
the
words
of
the
leary
opinion
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
since
all
heroin
is
illegally
imported
or
virtually
all,
a
jury
may
rationally
infer
and
thus
maybe
authorized
by
congress
to
infer
that
a
person
in
possession
of
275
bags
of
heroin
knows
that
it
was
illegally
imported.
the
drawing
of
such
inference
by
the
jury
from
the
conduct
of
the
accused
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case
is
after
all
the
ordinary
way
in
accusatorial
system
of
justice
in
which
it
is
determined
whether
the
accused
have
the
requisite
knowledge
or
other
mental
attributes
such
as
specific
intent
when
such
a
mental
attribute
is
an
element
of
a
crime.

mr.
justice
black,
the
tasks
of
whether
congress
can
authorize
the
jury
so
to
find
is
whether
it
would
be
rational
of
for
the
jury
to
do
so.
now,
i
recognize
that
once
one
accepts
your
premises
to
separation
of
powers
in
this
area,
the
internal
logic
of
your
position
is
indisputable
but
the
majority
of
the
court
has
not
accepted
that
premise
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
--
i'm
addressing
my
argument
in
terms
of
this
court's
decisions
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
petitioner
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
petitioner
is
not
any
body,
the
petitioner
was
someone
found
with
275
bags
of
heroin
in
his
possession
and
he
is
comparable
perhaps
to
a
dealer
in
rolls
royce
automobiles.
i
--i
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
the
jury
might
infer
that
someone
dealing
in
a
product
or
found
in
circumstances
which
suggest
that
he
is
dealing
in
a
product
knows
more
about
that
product
than
someone
who
doesn't
deal
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
one
is
knowledgeable
about
heroin,
this
is,
he
would
know
that
all
heroin
in
this
country
has
an
illegal
foreign
origin
and
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense
the
jury
might
infer
that
the
dealer
is
knowledgeable
about
the
product
in
which
he
is
dealing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
evidence,
no,
no.
the
evidence
is
that
he
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
possible
but
he
is
connected
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
with
the
operation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
has
seen
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
any
event,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
make
knowledge
of
illegal
importation
and
element
of
the
crime
and
to
give
an
opportunity
to
someone
to
prove
his
innocence
by
proving
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
illegal
importation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statute
was
an
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
just
by
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
submitting
his
testimony
to
the
jury
and
seeing
if
they
would
believe
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
could
disclaim
knowledge
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
originative
of
narcotics?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless
he
had
some
witness
who
is
willing
to
swear
to
some
evidence
other
than
hearsay,
it
can
be
conceived
that
would
indicate
that
he
was
knowledgeable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
but
there
is
nothing
to
foreclose
such
evidence
from
being
introduced.
but
in
any
event,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
his
reference
to
the
principle
that
possession
of
the
fruits
of
crime
recently
after
his
commission
justifies
an
influence
that
the
possession
is
guilty
possession.
but
knowledge
is
frequently
of
it
inferred
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
situations
comparable
to
that
contemplated
by
this
statute
and
this
is
widely
done
in
both
state
and
federal
law,
for
example
in
the
enforcement
of
the
national
motor
vehicle
fastback,
the
so
called
direct.
and
in
the
words
this
court
used
in
gainey
for
congress
to
authorized
the
jury
to
do
this
is
to
authorize
it
to
do
no
more
than
accord
to
the
evidence
if
unexplained,
its
natural
prohibitive
force.
we
also
contend
that
the
presumption
in
the
tax
stamp
statute
was
validly
applied
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
heroin
since
as
we
have
documented
in
our
brief,
heroin
is
not
available
in
tax
stamp
packages,
there
is
no
way
petitioner
could
have
procured
it
in
or
from
the
original
stamp
package
and
it
follows
that
congress
constitutionally
could
authorize
the
jury
to
infer
from
his
possession
of
the
heroin
that
he
had
purchased
it
in
violation
of
the
tax
stamps
statute
which
in
contrast
to
section
174
does
not
include
specific
knowledge
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
as
to
the
cocaine
counts,
we
first
concede
that
the
application
of
the
section
174
presumption
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
relatively
small
amount
of
cocaine
involved
in
this
case
was
not
warranted
under
the
constitutional
standard,
explained
and
applied
last
term
in
leary.
this
is
because
in
contrast
to
heroin,
there
are
as
indicated
in
our
brief
and
its
appendix,
substantial
quantities
of
cocaine
stolen
from
legitimate
sources
in
this
country
every
year
while
comparison
of
these
figures
with
the
admittedly
rough
estimates
set
forth
in
the
footnote
on
page
31
of
our
brief
of
the
quantities
of
cocaine
annually
smuggled
into
this
country
might
justify
an
inference
that
the
cocaine
found
in
the
elicit
trade
was
in
fact
was
illegally
imported.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
further
inference
of
knowledge
of
its
illegal
importation
meets
the
leary
standard
in
such
a
case
as
the
present
one
involving
less
than
Â¾
of
a
gram
of
cocaine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
the
latter
mr.
justice.
it
--
otherwise
the
reversal
just
eliminates
the
part
of
the
concurring
sentence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
either
alternative
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
presumably
and
i
think
either
would
be
an
acceptable
procedure.
so,
we
do
not
contend
that
this
conviction
met
the
leary
standard
but
in
conceding
this,
we
do
contend
that
this
court
need
not
and
should
not
now
decide
whether
the
section
174
presumption
could
validly
be
applied
to
possession
of
cocaine
in
an
amount
so
large
as
not
reasonably
likely
to
have
been
aggregated
from
individual
thefts
or
in
other
circumstances
pointing
to
a
foreign
source,
there
is
no
necessity
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
presumption
can
ever
bail
or
it
be
implied.
we
urge
on
the
other
hand
that
the
tax
stamp
presumption
was
validly
applied
to
position
--
to
petitioner's
possession
of
the
cocaine
and
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
we've
elaborated
in
our
brief.
turning
now
to
petitioner's
claims
based
on
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
we
recognize
that
when
a
statutory
presumption
is
applied
without
adequate
rational
foundation
as
we
concede
was
the
case
as
to
one
count
here,
one
way
of
articulating
the
constitutional
infirmity
is
to
say
that
so
applied,
the
presumption
impermissibly
impaired
the
defendant's
right
to
remain
silent
and
thus
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
when
however
such
a
presumption
is
applied
in
compliance
with
the
standard
of
rationality
established
by
this
court,
then
the
alleged
coercion
to
testify
stands
not
from
any
unconstitutional
compulsion
but
from
the
legitimate
force
of
the
government's
case.
it
is
not
uncommon
in
a
criminal
trial
for
the
defendant
to
be
faced
with
evidence
justifying
a
rational
inference
of
guilt
and
to
have
to
decide
whether
despite
attended
risks
of
doing
so,
he
will
testify
an
effort
to
overcome
the
force
of
that
evidence.
there
is
no
reason
relevant
to
the
policies
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
for
holding
that
the
status
of
such
a
defendant
differs
depending
on
whether
the
jury's
inference
of
guilt
is
authorized
by
judge
made
rule
of
evidence
or
by
a
rationally
warranted
statutory
provision.
in
either
instance
as
the
gainey
opinion
recognized,
the
courts
have
the
same
responsibility
to
decide
whether
the
government
has
made
a
submissible
case.
and
if
the
government's
evidence
meet
that
standard
and
we
contend
it
did
hear
with
respect
to
three
counts,
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
does
not
violate
the
constitutional
privilege
as
this
court
definitively
held
in
yee
hem
against
the
united
states,
and
the
passage
quoted
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
turning
finally
to
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
although
petitioner
did
not
accept
to
them
at
the
trial
and
did
not
request
that
the
jury
be
charged
not
to
draw
any
adverse
inference
from
his
failure
to
testify,
he
now
contends
that
the
reading
of
the
statutory
inferences
to
the
jury
in
the
course
of
the
instructions
constituted
adverse
comment
on
his
silence.
now,
substantially
the
same
contention
was
properly
rejected
by
this
court
in
gainey
in
which
very
similar
instructions
to
the
jury
were
upheld
in
a
situation
involving
a
similar
statutory
presumption.
now,
its
true
that
there
are
passages
in
the
instructions
which
were
read
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
which
have
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
trial
in
which
the
matter
put
in
issue
by
the
defense
was
the
question
of
possession,
that
was
what
they
were
contesting
at
trial
and
naturally,
the
trial
judge
emphasized
to
the
jury
that
that
was
a
crucial
issue
for
them
to
decide.
but
here
as
in
gainey,
at
reading
the
instruction
as
a
whole,
the
jury
was
merely
permitted
to
draw
rational
inferences
from
the
unexplained
circumstantial
evidence
presented
by
the
government
and
the
jury
was
specifically
admonished
that
they
were
to
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
judges
of
the
facts
and
that
the
burden
of
proving
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
on
the
government
not
withstanding
the
statutory
presumptions.
while
it
might
have
been
better
practice
as
the
gainey
opinion
suggest
to
omit
from
the
charge
any
explicit
reference
to
the
statutory
provisions
authorizing
the
inferences,
the
instructions
as
given
were
adequate
specially
in
the
absence
of
an
exception
and
do
not
differ
significantly
from
those
upheld
in
gainey.
it
is
therefore
our
position
that
accept
as
to
count
three,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
upholding
the
jury
verdict.
thank
you.
