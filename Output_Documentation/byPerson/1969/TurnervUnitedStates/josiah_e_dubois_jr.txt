mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
i
have
agreed
with
mr.
rivkin
who
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
that
with
the
concern
of
the
court,
he
may
use
anytime
of
the
remaining
after
my
principal
argument.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
as
part
of
--
yes.
he's
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
my
side
of
that
case.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
well,
if
he
does,
--
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
it's
more
or
less.
now,
this
case
involves
convictions
under
section
174
of
title
21
of
the
united
states
code
and
section
4704
(a),
of
title
26
of
the
united
state
code
relating
to
two
narcotic
drugs
specifically
heroin
and
cocaine.
now,
it's
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
presumptions
contained
in
both
of
these
sections
of
the
code
are
unconstitutional,
because
they
discourage
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
remain
silent,
and
specifically
we
rely
heavily
upon
the
two
relatively
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
of
petitioner,
namely
griffin
versus
california
and
united
states
versus
jackson.
now
without
repeating
in
detail,
all
of
the
arguments
contained
in
the
brief,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
certain
points
for
consideration
of
the
court.
first,
section
174
of
title
21
of
the
united
states
code
requires
that
the
defendant
know
that
narcotic
drugs
in
question
“to
have
been
imported
or
brought
into
the
united
states
contrary
to
law.”
now
in
the
government's
brief,
it
is
a
claimed
that
it
is
rational
to
permit
the
jury
in
this
case
to
infer
that
a
person
in
possession
of
a
relatively
large
amount
of
heroin,
knows
that
it
was
illegally
imported.
and
in
making
this
argument,
the
government's
brief
approach
from,
were
then
apparently
ignores
the
charge
of
the
district
court
judge
in
which
the
judge
said
specifically
and
i
quote.
now
obviously,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
this
particular
defendant
knew
that
this
cocaine
and
this
heroin
--
heroin
excuse
me,
have
been
imported
into
the
united
states
contrary
to
law.
district
court
judge
and
went
on
to
say,
the
statute
recognizing
the
impossibility
approving
knowledge
in
this
cases
and
having
in
mind
the
welfare
of
the
people
which
is
a
purpose
of
the
food
and
drug
act,
says
that
all
you
have
to
do,
all
the
government
has
to
do
is
show
that
there
was
possession
of
this
drug
by
the
defendant
on
trial
and
that
evidence
shall
suffice
to
authorize
a
violation
of
the
statute
unless
by
the
witnesses
presented
possession
of
the
drugs
by
this
defendant
under
those
circumstances
will
satisfactory
explain
to
the
jury.
it
is
abundantly
clear
therefore
that
under
the
instructions
from
the
district
court
judge,
the
jury
did
not
indulge
in
any
rationalization
such
as
that
contained
in
the
government's
brief,
namely,
the
jury
under
the
judge's
instructions
certainly
did
not
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
because
there
was
a
large
amount
of
heroin
that
therefore
the
defendant
knew
it
was
illegally
imported
because
the
judge
told
the
jury,
all
you
have
to
find
gentleman
is
possession.
so,
i
feel
that
the
whole
argument
in
the
government's
brief
concerning
the
so
called
rational
interest,
the
mere
to
be
drawn
by
jury,
by
the
possession
of
this
large
amount
of
heroin
is
completely
immaterial.
secondly,
the
government's
brief
and
supplemental
memorandum
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
pointing
out
that
heroin
is
neither
produced
in
the
united
states
nor
legally
imported
into
the
united
state.
now,
even
assuming
we
stipulate
this
fact,
it
is
our
position
that
this
statement
leads
to
nowhere.
certainly,
if
this
is
true,
i
never
knew
it
before
reading
the
government's
brief
and
there
is
certainly
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
knew
this
to
be
true.
in
fact
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
district
court
judge
specifically
charged.
now
obviously,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
this
particular
defendant
knew
that
this
cocaine
and
heroin
had
been
imported
into
the
united
state
contrary
to
law.
now,
my
next
point
is
--
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes,
so
far
as
under
the
section
174
of
title
21,
the
government
did
concede
the
cocaine,
of
course
i'm
sorry.
yes.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
yes,
right.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
presumption
than
mere
possession
of
narcotics
drugs
is
sufficient
evidence
of
the
violation
of
section
174
of
title
21
requiring
that
the
defendant
know
the
drugs
have
been
imported
contrary
to
law
is
unconstitutional
to
use
the
words
of
the
griffin
case,
it
cuts
down
on
the
privilege
by
making
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
coarsely
and
to
use
the
words
of
the
jackson
case,
it
shows
the
assertion
of
that
right.
now,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
the
jackson
case,
the
defendant
pleaded
not
guilty
and
demanded
a
jury
trial.
but
this
court
do
said
that
the
provision
in
the
federal
kidnapping
act
that
permits
him
to
get
descent
if
he
ask
for
a
jury
trial
was
unconstitutional
because
it
shows
his
right
not
--
to
plead
not
guilty
and
to
ask
for
a
jury
trial,
and
we
say
that
the
right
to
remain
silent
is
just
as
precious
as
the
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty.
now,
with
respect
to
the
convictions
under
section
4704
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
here
again
is
a
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
presumption
contained
in
this
section
of
the
code
or
vying
that
mere
possession
of
the
drugs
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
violation
of
the
section
is
unconstitutional,
again
because
it
discourages
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
remain
silent.
it
is
to
be
noted
and
this
is
not
brought
out
at
least
in
the
government's
brief
that
whereas
the
indictment
under
this
section
of
the
code
charged
the
defendant
with
unlawful
purchase,
possession,
dispensing
and
distributing
of
narcotic
drugs,
and
whereas,
the
judgment
of
conviction
resides
possession
as
well
as
purchase
in
dispensing
and
distributing.
in
fact,
this
section
of
the
code
does
not
make
the
possession
of
narcotic
drugs
a
crime.
specifically
said
statute
says
that,
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
purchase,
sell,
dispense
or
distribute
narcotic
drugs
except
in
the
original
stamp
packing.
then,
the
statute
provides
as
i've
indicated,
the
possession
shall
be
prima
facia
evidence
of
violation.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
purchased,
sold,
dispense
or
distributed
narcotic
drug.
and
here
again,
the
charge
of
the
district
court
judge
to
me
is
almost
conclusive.
he
said
to
the
jury
so
that
in
effect
your
problem,
your
principle
problem
here
will
be
to
determine
whether
or
not
certain
qualities
of
heroin
and
cocaine
which
have
been
more
in
evidence
in
this
case
were
in
the
possession
of
--
or
under
the
control
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
here
again,
the
jury
was
instructed
in
effect
that
so
wrong
as
the
defendant
was
found
to
be
in
possession
of
the
drugs
that
was
all
that
was
needed,
and
here
again,
the
jury
obviously
must
determine
guilt
solely
on
the
basis
of
possession.
so,
in
closing,
we
say
that
the
presumptions
in
both
of
these
sections
of
the
statute
are
unconstitutional
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
griffin
case
and
the
jackson
case
dictate
that
this
presumption
be
declared
unconstitutional.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
i
just
want
to
say
yee
hem
and
casey
decisions
were
decided
before
judge
and
reading
the
yee
hem
decision
particularly
that
part
called
government's
brief
and
the
judge's
decision
is
different
like
day
and
night.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
argument
here
still
seem
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
judge
said,
obviously
there
is
no
evidence,
that
this
defendant
knew
that
this
cocaine,
heroin
had
been
unlawfully
imported
and
then
he
added
that
the
statute
recognizes
the
possibility
of
proving
that,
that's
why
he
is
charged.
and
thirdly,
may
i
here
to
point
out
that
as
i
did
before
that
the
section
relating
to
stamps
does
not
make
possession
a
crime
or
the
indictment
contain
the
word
possession
and
the
conviction
containing
the
word
possession.
thank
you.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
i
have
agreed
with
mr.
rivkin
who
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
that
with
the
concern
of
the
court,
he
may
use
anytime
of
the
remaining
after
my
principal
argument.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
as
part
of
--
yes.
he's
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
my
side
of
that
case.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
well,
if
he
does,
--
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
it's
more
or
less.
now,
this
case
involves
convictions
under
section
174
of
title
21
of
the
united
states
code
and
section
4704
(a),
of
title
26
of
the
united

code
relating

case.
here
again,
the
jury
was
instructed
in
effect
that
so
wrong
as
the
defendant
was
found
to
be
in
possession
of
the
drugs
that
was
all
that
was
needed,
and
here
again,
the
jury
obviously
must
determine
guilt
solely
on
the
basis
of
possession.
so,
in
closing,
we
say
that
the
presumptions
in
both
of
these
sections
of
the
statute
are
unconstitutional
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
griffin
case
and
the
jackson
case
dictate
that
this
presumption
be
declared
unconstitutional.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
josiah
e.
dubois,
jr.
i
just
want
to
say
yee
hem
and
casey
decisions
were
decided
before
judge
and
reading
the
yee
hem
decision
particularly
that
part
called
government's
brief
and
the
judge's
decision
is
different
like
day
and
night.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
argument
here
still
seem
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
lower
court
judge
said,
obviously
there
is
no
evidence,
that
this
defendant
knew
that
this
cocaine,
heroin
had
been
unlawfully
imported
and
then
he
added
that
the
statute
recognizes
the
possibility
of
proving
that,
that's
why
he
is
charged.
and
thirdly,
may
i
here
to
point
out
that
as
i
did
before
that
the
section
relating
to
stamps
does
not
make
possession
a
crime
or
the
indictment
contain
the
word
possession
and
the
conviction
containing
the
word
possession.
thank
you.
