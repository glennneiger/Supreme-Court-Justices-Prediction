mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
united
states
believes
that
this
case
does
present
the
court
within
an
appropriate
opportunity
to
correct
a
harmful
basic
incongruity
in
decisions
under
the
patent
law.
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
which
was
applied
by
the
courts
below
is
not
a
statutory
doctrine.
it
has
never
been
provided
for
by
congress
in
the
1952
act
or
in
any
of
the
previous
patent
litigation
or
patent
legislation.
and
indeed
congress
did
not
in
any
of
its
revisions
specifically
address
it
self
to
the
question
of
the
continuing
validity
of
this
judicially
created
doctrine.
our
submission
is
that
although
the
doctrine
may
have
one
time
had
been
appropriate.
it
is
long
since
long
before
the
1952
revision
been
inconsistent
with
basic
policies
of
the
federal
patent
system
as
developed
by
congress
and
by
judicial
decision.
and
that
the
doctrine
should
now
be
fundamentally
revised
in
favor
of
the
standard
of
infringement
which
is
compatible
with
the
statutory
scheme.
and
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
this
since
congress
has
never
yet
considered
the
doctrine.
there's
no
reason
to
wait
and
see
whether
the
congress
might
to
do
so
as
the
amicus
brief
of
patent
law
association
suggests
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
at
every
stage
of
this
litigation,
the
petitioner
contended
that
because
of
the
limitation
in
the
claims,
his
play
it
could
not
be
considered
an
infringement.
and
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
could
not
be
applied
so
as
to
hold
that
he
was
infringing
a
claim
so
limited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
it
really
is
a
different
articulation
of
the
question
whether
or
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
can
appropriately
be
applied
by
the
courts
to
expand
patent
of
appellees
beyond
the
terms
of
their
claims.
i
don't
see
that
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
not
sir
nor
did
we
support
the
petition.
it
was
only
after
the
petition
was
granted
the
case
came
to
our
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
seems
to
be
the
tendency
of
the
formulation
in
graver
tank.
it's
difficult
to
know
and
predict.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
in
application,
the
courts
don't
seem
to
go
to
that
far
with
the
doctrine.
but
it's
difficult
to
put
your
finger
on
any
principle
which
indicates
how
far
along
the
path
to
that
the
courts
will
go
and
applying
the
doctrine
so
long
as
a
litigant
is
able
to
convince
them
that
the
allegedly
infringing
device
accomplishes
substantial
in
the
same
thing
and
substantially
the
same
way
as
the
patent
and
device
even
though
the
terms
of
the
claim
do
not
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that
the
claiming
in
requirement
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
part
of
the
language
in
addition
to
the
reissue
provisions
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
identical.
our
submission
is
the
graver
tank
was
wrongly
decided
not
that
congress
rejected
it
in
the
1952
act.
congress
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
bad
as
our
submission.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
the
provision
in
the
52
act
for
the
means
claim.
that
was
in
innovation
but
we
don't
read
that
as
meaning
that
congress
intended
to
overrule
graver
tank.
that's
quoted
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
congress
did
not
devote
specific
attention
to
graver
tank
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
known
infringement
section,
but
it
didn't
refer
to
the
equivalence
doctrine
or
whatsoever.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
it
fair
to
say
that
congress
left
this
matter
where
it
always
was
as
a
judicial
matter.
congress
did
not
give
attention
to
this
question
and
i
don't
think
the
judiciaries
incapacitated
from
directing
its
own
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
was
no
statutory
provision
construed
in
graver
tank.
this
is
a
judge
made
doctrine
and
always
has
been.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
a
patent
code
that
can
be
said
as
most
areas
of
the
law,
but
this
standard
of
infringement
has
never
been
provided
for
by
statute.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
attributed
to
congress.
as
our
view
is
if
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
devised
by
judges
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
determining
in
infringement
in
historical
setting
which
simply
no
longer
obtain.
it's
an
appropriate
occasion
for
this
court
to
recognize
that
it
has
become
outmoded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
we
don't
your
honor.
i'm
authorized
to
speak
only
to
this
matter
of
the
equivalence
doctrine.
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
matter
of
general
public
importance
in
the
case.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
the
historical
setting
which
gave
rise
to
that
doctrine
since
the
description
of
it
in
our
brief
is
somewhat
over
simplified
and
i
commanded
the
court's
attention
of
comprehensive
study
of
this
history
not
cited
in
the
briefs
entitled
evolution
of
the
claims
if
you
ask
patents
by
carol
b.
lutz,
published
in
three
parts
in
volume
20
of
the
journal
of
the
patent
office
society
in
1938.
while
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
first
articulated
by
this
court
in
1854
in
3025
it
amounted
to
an
elaboration
of
a
general
approach,
the
judges
had
been
taken
to
the
question
at
patent
infringement
from
the
earliest
period.
there
was
as
the
brief
for
the
patent
law
association
notes,
no
statutory
requirement
of
claims
in
patent
applications
prior
to
the
patent
act
of
1836,
although
the
earlier
statutes
did
require
the
patentee
in
a
general
way
to
distinguish
his
invention
from
all
other
things
before
now.
and
as
a
result
of
judicial
interpretations
of
this
general
requirement
claims
began
to
be
included
in
many
patent
applications.
and
the
1836
act
under
which
3114
was
decided
codified
this
practice
in
its
provision
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
association
requiring
the
applicant
to
particularly
specify
and
point
out
the
part
improvement
or
combination
which
he
claims
as
his
invention
or
discovery.
while
claims
where
thereafter
used
in
patent
applications,
they
tended
it
first
to
be
far
mass
definitive
than
the
claims
in
modern
patent
practice.
often
what
was
claimed
was
the
concept
or
idea
or
principle
in
body
in
the
invention
even
though
that
of
course
is
not
what
is
patentable
and
the
claims
tended
to
be
drafted
with
references
back
to
the
specifications
at
critical
points
where
specific
definitive
statements
of
what
is
claimed
would
be
required
today.
example
can
be
found
in
the
claims
in
this
court
decision
in
3213
cited
in
our
brief,
volume
1
of
wallace.
and
other
examples
are
sided
mr.
lutz.
as
the
patent
office
and
the
court's
gradually
began
to
apply
more
exacting
requirements
of
claiming,
the
trend
was
reflected
in
the
greater
emphasis
on
distinctness
and
particularity
in
claiming
included
in
the
1870
revision
of
the
patent
law
and
carried
for
with
ever
since
that
the
important
thing
as
we
see
it
is
that
during
this
early
period
when
patent
application
seldom
included
definitive
claims
to
the
extent
that
the
courts
enforce
the
statutory
requirement
of
the
applicant
distinguish
the
new
from
the
old
or
the
claiming
requirement
of
the
1836
act.
that
enforcement
was
confined
to
rulings
on
patent
validity.
the
question
of
infringement
was
almost
universally
regarded
as
a
question
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
comparing
the
machines
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
the
equivalence
doctrine
then
was
merely
an
elaboration
of
this
general
approach.
the
claiming
requirement
during
this
period
was
in
effect
treated
as
a
technicality
going
only
to
the
question
of
patent
validity.
the
claims
really
couldn't
serve
to
notify
would
be
competitors
of
the
scope
of
the
monopoly
that
merely
indicated
to
them
whether
valid
patent
existed.
of
course
the
different
view
was
sometimes
expressed
as
it
was
by
the
dissenting
justices
in
3400
but
it
was
not
until
1877.
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court
in
keystone
bridge
95
us
that
it
was
held
that
the
claiming
requirement
is
not
under
technicality
and
in
deed
the
patentees
are
bound
by
their
claims
as
the
definition
of
their
judicially
enforceable
monopolies.
the
court's
opinion
there
relied
under
reissue
provisions
of
the
patent
law
as
well
as
on
the
claiming
requirement
and
pointed
out
that
it
is
in
the
patent
office
that
the
patentees
“claim
is\or
is
suppose
to
be
examined,
scrutinized,
limited
and
made
to
conform
to
what
he
is
entitled
to.”
they
followed
the
many
decisions
discussed
in
our
brief
in
which
this
court
has
held
the
claim
as
the
measure
of
the
grant
to
be
relied
on
as
such
by
the
patentee's
competitors.
and
yet
the
equivalence
doctrine
which
denies
this
and
was
build
on
a
contrary
premise
has
also
been
carried
forward
by
a
kind
of
a
nurture
which
can
preserve
inconsistencies
and
the
law
as
a
matter
of
3525.
cristor
has
been
in
a
accommodation
to
the
extent
that
the
equivalence
doctrine
has
been
limited
by
the
doctrine
of
file
wrapper
estoppel
which
prevents
the
patentee
from
asserting
dominion
over
the
area
he
renounced
before
the
patent
office
by
amending
his
claims
to
induce
issuance
of
the
patent.
our
view
is
that
this
doctrine
should
be
regarded
not
merely
as
a
narrow
principle
of
estoppel,
but
as
one
manifestation
of
the
basic
tenant
of
the
keystone
bridge
opinion
and
of
the
patent
system.
that
the
only
patent
monopolies
that
are
judicially
enforceable
are
those
defined
by
claims
that
have
been
approved
by
the
patent
office.
our
proposal
therefore
is
that
the
equivalence
doctrine
with
its
wide
range
of
inquiry
and
unpredictability
of
result
should
now
be
rejected
in
favor
of
a
standard
of
infringement
which
focuses
on
the
claims
in
the
light
of
their
statutory
function.
one
possibility
of
course
would
be
a
standard
that
would
limit
infringement
to
articles
that
come
literally
within
the
terms
of
the
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
second
circuit
once
took
that
position
by
holding
that
under
the
logic
of
the
patent
system,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
can
mean
no
more
than
that
the
language
of
the
claim
shall
be
generously
construed.
but
it
abandoned
the
position
because
of
this
court's
decision
upholding
the
equivalence
doctrine.
this
was
explained
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
claude
neon
lights
opinion
discussed
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
the
policies
in
logic
of
the
patent
system
do
not
require
a
test
originally
verbalistic
which
would
insolate
the
copying
of
inventions
with
only
the
most
trivial
or
colorable
deviation
from
the
literal
terms
of
the
claims.
we
think
the
court
was
correct
in
saying
in
the
graver
tank
opinion
that
section
approach
would
unduly
exult
form
over
substance
even
though
we
regard
the
holding
rational
of
that
decision
as
an
unfortunate
over
reaction
to
this
problem.
what
we
urge
is
a
test
based
on
the
substance
of
the
claims,
a
test
based
on
the
substance
of
what
the
patent
office
passed
on
and
approved
as
the
definition
of
the
legally
warranted
scope
of
the
monopoly.
this
is
not
an
entirely
novel
proposal.
we
discovered
in
preparing
for
this
argument
that
it
basically
similar
approach
was
proposed
in
an
article
published
in
1948,
two
years
before
the
graver
tank
decision
by
one
of
this
country's
most
thoughtful
patent
lawyers,
mr.
william
r.
woodward.
the
article
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
its
entitled
the
definiteness
and
particularity
in
patent
claims
and
appears
in
48
michigan
law
review
755,
after
noting
that
the
entire
logic
of
the
development
of
the
patent
system
has
been
to
limit
the
patent
owner
more
and
more
to
the
terms
that
the
claims.
mr.
woodward
wrote
the
principal
of
3908
can
be
reconciled
with
this
development
only
“if
one
treats
the
so
called
doctrine
of
equivalence
merely
as
a
form
of
relief
against
the
almost
inevitable
inadvertences
involved
in
the
formulation
of
patent
claims.
the
relief
must
be
applied
only
when
the
case
is
clear
enough
to
establish
strong
equities
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
little
or
not
in
favor
of
the
defendant
or
when
the
point
is
a
mere
technicality
or
so
obvious
for
realistic
appraisal
that
reissue
proceedings
would
not
be
necessary
for
a
full
protection
of
the
public
and
would
be
an
unnecessary
burden
to
impose
on
the
patentee.”
this
expresses
the
general
trust
of
the
test
we
have
proposed
in
terms
of
whether
a
revised
claim
which
would
literally
cover
the
allegedly
infringing
article
would
have
presented
essentially
the
same
case
to
the
patent
office
would
have
presented
no
difference
in
the
issues
of
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness.
so
that
a
court
and
would
be
competitors
can
conclude
with
assurance
that
the
patent
office
did
in
substance
approve
a
monopoly
and
the
scope
sought
to
be
enforced.
and
vast
the
requiring
reissue
proceedings
would
be
superfluous.
by
this
we
mean
superfluous
is
not
merely
in
the
sense
that
the
court
can
predict
what
the
resulted
of
reissue
proceedings
would
have
been,
but
superfluous
because
the
court
has
satisfied
that
they
would
have
been
nothing
more
for
the
patent
office
to
decide.
under
this
standard,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
expansion
of
the
patent
monopoly
granted
by
the
court's
below
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
expansion
that
should
require
her
reissue
proceeding
and
not
be
made
by
the
courts.
the
claim
here
was
expressly
limited
to
a
play
patent
in
which
the
base
plate
has
“a
pair
of
space
openings”
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.
petitioner
threads
the
draw
strings
through
a
single
opening
in
the
base
plate
of
his
play
patent.
the
claim
could
have
been
drafted
so
as
to
cover
both
situations
either
in
the
form
of
the
means
claim
such
as
“said
base
plate
having
an
aperture
means
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.”
this
is
drafted
in
the
consultation
with
the
patent
office
i
might
add
or
by
claiming
that
the
base
plate
has
“at
least
one
opening”
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.
in
deed,
there's
a
means
claim
at
the
end
of
this
very
claim.
the
difference
relates
to
a
functional
aspect
of
the
invention
about
which
it
seems
to
us
the
courts
cannot
confidently
conclude
that
the
more
embracive
claim
would
have
presented
no
differences
in
the
issues
of
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
bader
can.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
as
to
a
nonfunctional
aspect
such
as
if
the
claim
specified
the
color
of
the
base
plate
for
example
and
a
context
which
this
is
obviously
nonfunctional.
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
anyone
to
assume
that
the
grant
from
the
patent
office
is
so
arbitrary
limited
in
the
scope
of
the
monopoly
approved.
here
however,
we
believe
this
kind
of
functional
in
difference
does
invoke
the
principle
of
the
keystone
bridge
case
that
patentees
are
bound
by
the
terms
of
their
claim.
so
our
submission
is
that
amorphous
nature
of
the
equivalence
doctrine
along
with
what
judge
learned
hand
referred
to
in
claude
neon
lights
as
the
vacillation
in
this
court's
decision
attributable
to
an
inconsistency
and
theory
have
resulted
in
regrettable
uncertainty
as
to
the
permissible
scope
of
competitive
enterprise.
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
discussed
in
our
brief
that
an
unwarranted
zone
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
scope
of
patent
monopolies
can
harmfully
deprive
the
public
of
the
benefits
of
legitimate
competition.
people
will
still
clear
in
the
zone
of
uncertainty,
a
familiar
principle
and
decisions
of
this
court
in
many
areas.
we
asked
the
court
to
address
itself
to
the
inconsistency
in
precedent
which
is
at
the
root
of
the
present
uncertainty
in
this
area
and
to
bring
coherence
to
this
aspect
of
the
competitive
economy
by
implementing
congressional
patent
policy
in
the
manner
we
have
proposed.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
united
states
believes
that
this
case
does
present
the
court
within
an
appropriate
opportunity
to
correct
a
harmful
basic
incongruity
in
decisions
under
the
patent
law.
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
which
was
applied
by
the
courts
below
is
not
a
statutory
doctrine.
it
has
never
been
provided
for
by
congress
in
the
1952
act
or
in
any
of
the
previous
patent
litigation
or
patent
legislation.
and
indeed
congress
did
not
in
any
of
its
revisions
specifically
address
it
self
to
the
question
of
the
continuing
validity
of
this
judicially
created
doctrine.
our
submission
is
that
although
the
doctrine
may
have
one
time
had
been
appropriate.
it
is
long
since
long
before
the
1952
revision
been
inconsistent
with
basic
policies
of
the
federal
patent
system
as
developed
by
congress
and
by
judicial
decision.
and
that
the
doctrine
should
now
be
fundamentally
revised
in
favor
of
the
standard
of
infringement
which
is
compatible
with
the
statutory
scheme.
and
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
this
since
congress
has
never
yet
considered
the
doctrine.
there's
no
reason
to
wait
and
see
whether
the
congress
might
to
do
so
as
the
amicus
brief
of
patent
law
association
suggests
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
at
every
stage
of
this
litigation,
the
petitioner
contended
that
because
of
the
limitation
in
the
claims,
his
play
it
could
not
be
considered
an
infringement.
and
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
could
not
be
applied
so
as
to
hold
that
he
was
infringing
a
claim
so
limited.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
it
really
is
a
different
articulation
of
the
question
whether
or
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
can
appropriately
be
applied
by
the
courts
to
expand
patent
of
appellees
beyond
the
terms
of
their
claims.
i
don't
see
that
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
not
sir
nor
did
we
support
the
petition.
it
was
only
after
the
petition
was
granted
the
case
came
to
our
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
that
seems
to
be
the
tendency
of
the
formulation
in
graver
tank.
it's
difficult
to
know
and
predict.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
in
application,
the
courts
don't
seem
to
go
to
that
far
with
the
doctrine.
but
it's
difficult
to
put
your
finger
on
any
principle
which
indicates
how
far
along
the
path
to
that
the
courts
will
go
and
applying
the
doctrine
so
long
as
a
litigant
is
able
to
convince
them
that
the
allegedly
infringing
device
accomplishes
substantial
in
the
same
thing
and
substantially
the
same
way
as
the
patent
and
device
even
though
the
terms
of
the
claim
do
not
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that
the
claiming
in
requirement
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
part
of
the
language
in
addition
to
the
reissue
provisions
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
identical.
our
submission
is
the
graver
tank
was
wrongly
decided
not
that
congress
rejected
it
in
the
1952
act.
congress
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
bad
as
our
submission.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
the
provision
in
the
52
act
for
the
means
claim.
that
was
in
innovation
but
we
don't
read
that
as
meaning
that
congress
intended
to
overrule
graver
tank.
that's
quoted
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
congress
did
not
devote
specific
attention
to
graver
tank
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
known
infringement
section,
but
it
didn't
refer
to
the
equivalence
doctrine
or
whatsoever.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
it
fair
to
say
that
congress
left
this
matter
where
it
always
was
as
a
judicial
matter.
congress
did
not
give
attention
to
this
question
and
i
don't
think
the
judiciaries
incapacitated
from
directing
its
own
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
was
no
statutory
provision
construed
in
graver
tank.
this
is
a
judge
made
doctrine
and
always
has
been.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
a
patent
code
that
can
be
said
as
most
areas
of
the
law,
but
this
standard
of
infringement
has
never
been
provided
for
by
statute.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
attributed
to
congress.
as
our
view
is
if
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
devised
by
judges
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
determining
in
infringement
in
historical
setting
which
simply
no
longer
obtain.
it's
an
appropriate
occasion
for
this
court
to
recognize
that
it
has
become
outmoded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
we
don't
your
honor.
i'm
authorized
to
speak
only
to
this
matter
of
the
equivalence
doctrine.
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
matter
of
general
public
importance
in
the
case.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
the
historical
setting
which
gave
rise
to
that
doctrine
since
the
description
of
it
in
our
brief
is
somewhat
over
simplified
and
i
commanded
the
court's
attention
of
comprehensive
study
of
this
history
not
cited
in
the
briefs
entitled
evolution
of
the
claims
if
you
ask
patents
by
carol
b.
lutz,
published
in
three
parts
in
volume
20
of
the
journal
of
the
patent
office
society
in
1938.
while
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
first
articulated
by
this
court
in
1854
in
3025
it
amounted
to
an
elaboration
of
a
general
approach,
the
judges
had
been
taken
to
the
question
at
patent
infringement
from
the
earliest
period.
there
was
as
the
brief
for
the
patent
law
association
notes,
no
statutory
requirement
of
claims
in
patent
applications
prior
to
the
patent
act
of
1836,
although
the
earlier
statutes
did
require
the
patentee
in
a
general
way
to
distinguish
his
invention
from
all
other
things
before
now.
and
as
a
result
of
judicial
interpretations
of
this
general
requirement
claims
began
to
be
included
in
many
patent
applications.
and
the
1836
act
under
which
3114
was
decided
codified
this
practice
in
its
provision
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
association
requiring
the
applicant
to
particularly
specify
and
point
out
the
part
improvement
or
combination
which
he
claims
as
his
invention
or
discovery.
while
claims
where
thereafter
used
in
patent
applications,
they
tended
it
first
to
be
far
mass
definitive
than
the
claims
in
modern
patent
practice.
often
what
was
claimed
was
the
concept
or
idea
or
principle
in
body
in
the
invention
even
though
that
of
course
is
not
what
is
patentable
and
the
claims
tended
to
be
drafted
with
references
back
to
the
specifications
at
critical
points
where
specific
definitive
statements
of
what
is
claimed
would
be
required
today.
example
can
be
found
in
the
claims
in
this
court
decision
in
3213
cited
in
our
brief,
volume
1
of
wallace.
and
other
examples
are
sided
mr.
lutz.
as
the
patent
office
and
the
court's
gradually
began
to
apply
more
exacting
requirements
of
claiming,
the
trend
was
reflected
in
the
greater
emphasis
on
distinctness
and
particularity
in
claiming
included
in
the
1870
revision
of
the
patent
law
and
carried
for
with
ever
since
that
the
important
thing
as
we
see
it
is
that
during
this
early
period
when
patent
application
seldom
included
definitive
claims
to
the
extent
that
the
courts
enforce
the
statutory
requirement
of
the
applicant
distinguish
the
new
from
the
old
or
the
claiming
requirement
of
the
1836
act.
that
enforcement
was
confined
to
rulings
on
patent
validity.
the
question
of
infringement
was
almost
universally
regarded
as
a
question
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
comparing
the
machines
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
the
equivalence
doctrine
then
was
merely
an
elaboration
of
this
general
approach.
the
claiming
requirement
during
this
period
was
in
effect
treated
as
a
technicality
going
only
to
the
question
of
patent
validity.
the
claims
really
couldn't
serve
to
notify
would
be
competitors
of
the
scope
of
the
monopoly
that
merely
indicated
to
them
whether
valid
patent
existed.
of
course
the
different
view
was
sometimes
expressed
as
it
was
by
the
dissenting
justices
in
3400
but
it
was
not
until
1877.
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court
in
keystone
bridge
95
us
that
it
was
held
that
the
claiming
requirement
is
not
under
technicality
and
in
deed
the
patentees
are
bound
by
their
claims
as
the
definition
of
their
judicially
enforceable
monopolies.
the
court's
opinion
there
relied
under
reissue
provisions
of
the
patent
law
as
well
as
on
the
claiming
requirement
and
pointed
out
that
it
is
in
the
patent
office
that
the
patentees
“claim
is\or
is
suppose
to
be
examined,
scrutinized,
limited
and
made
to
conform
to
what
he
is
entitled
to.”
they
followed
the
many
decisions
discussed
in
our
brief
in
which
this
court
has
held
the
claim
as
the
measure
of
the
grant
to
be
relied
on
as
such
by
the
patentee's
competitors.
and
yet
the
equivalence
doctrine
which
denies
this
and
was
build
on
a
contrary
premise
has
also
been
carried
forward
by
a
kind
of
a
nurture
which
can
preserve
inconsistencies
and
the
law
as
a
matter
of
3525.
cristor
has
been
in
a
accommodation
to
the
extent
that
the
equivalence
doctrine
has
been
limited
by
the
doctrine
of
file
wrapper
estoppel
which
prevents
the
patentee
from
asserting
dominion
over
the
area
he
renounced
before
the
patent
office
by
amending
his
claims
to
induce
issuance
of
the
patent.
our
view
is
that
this
doctrine
should
be
regarded
not
merely
as
a
narrow
principle
of
estoppel,
but
as
one
manifestation
of
the
basic
tenant
of
the
keystone
bridge
opinion
and
of
the
patent
system.
that
the
only
patent
monopolies
that
are
judicially
enforceable
are
those
defined
by
claims
that
have
been
approved
by
the
patent
office.
our
proposal
therefore
is
that
the
equivalence
doctrine
with
its
wide
range
of
inquiry
and
unpredictability
of
result
should
now
be
rejected
in
favor
of
a
standard
of
infringement
which
focuses
on
the
claims
in
the
light
of
their
statutory
function.
one
possibility
of
course
would
be
a
standard
that
would
limit
infringement
to
articles
that
come
literally
within
the
terms
of
the
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
second
circuit
once
took
that
position
by
holding
that
under
the
logic
of
the
patent
system,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
can
mean
no
more
than
that
the
language
of
the
claim
shall
be
generously
construed.
but
it
abandoned
the
position
because
of
this
court's
decision
upholding
the
equivalence
doctrine.
this
was
explained
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
claude
neon
lights
opinion
discussed
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
the
policies
in
logic
of
the
patent
system
do
not
require
a
test
originally
verbalistic
which
would
insolate
the
copying
of
inventions
with
only
the
most
trivial
or
colorable
deviation
from
the
literal
terms
of
the
claims.
we
think
the
court
was
correct
in
saying
in
the
graver
tank
opinion
that
section
approach
would
unduly
exult
form
over
substance
even
though
we
regard
the
holding
rational
of
that
decision
as
an
unfortunate
over
reaction
to
this
problem.
what
we
urge
is
a
test
based
on
the
substance
of
the
claims,
a
test
based
on
the
substance
of
what
the
patent
office
passed
on
and
approved
as
the
definition
of
the
legally
warranted
scope
of
the
monopoly.
this
is
not
an
entirely
novel
proposal.
we
discovered
in
preparing
for
this
argument
that
it
basically
similar
approach
was
proposed
in
an
article
published
in
1948,
two
years
before
the
graver
tank
decision
by
one
of
this
country's
most
thoughtful
patent
lawyers,
mr.
william
r.
woodward.
the
article
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
its
entitled
the
definiteness
and
particularity
in
patent
claims
and
appears
in
48
michigan
law
review
755,
after
noting
that
the
entire
logic
of
the
development
of
the
patent
system
has
been
to
limit
the
patent
owner
more
and
more
to
the
terms
that
the
claims.
mr.
woodward
wrote
the
principal
of
3908
can
be
reconciled
with
this
development
only
“if
one
treats
the
so
called
doctrine
of
equivalence
merely
as
a
form
of
relief
against
the
almost
inevitable
inadvertences
involved
in
the
formulation
of
patent
claims.
the
relief
must
be
applied
only
when
the
case
is
clear
enough
to
establish
strong
equities
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
little
or
not
in
favor
of
the
defendant
or
when
the
point
is
a
mere
technicality
or
so
obvious
for
realistic
appraisal
that
reissue
proceedings
would
not
be
necessary
for
a
full
protection
of
the
public
and
would
be
an
unnecessary
burden
to
impose
on
the
patentee.”
this
expresses
the
general
trust
of
the
test
we
have
proposed
in
terms
of
whether
a
revised
claim
which
would
literally
cover
the
allegedly
infringing
article
would
have
presented
essentially
the
same
case
to
the
patent
office
would
have
presented
no
difference
in
the
issues
of
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness.
so
that
a
court
and
would
be
competitors
can
conclude
with
assurance
that
the
patent
office
did
in
substance
approve
a
monopoly
and
the
scope
sought
to
be
enforced.
and
vast
the
requiring
reissue
proceedings
would
be
superfluous.
by
this
we
mean
superfluous
is
not
merely
in
the
sense
that
the
court
can
predict
what
the
resulted
of
reissue
proceedings
would
have
been,
but
superfluous
because
the
court
has
satisfied
that
they
would
have
been
nothing
more
for
the
patent
office
to
decide.
under
this
standard,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
expansion
of
the
patent
monopoly
granted
by
the
court's
below
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
expansion
that
should
require
her
reissue
proceeding
and
not
be
made
by
the
courts.
the
claim
here
was
expressly
limited
to
a
play
patent
in
which
the
base
plate
has
“a
pair
of
space
openings”
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.
petitioner
threads
the
draw
strings
through
a
single
opening
in
the
base
plate
of
his
play
patent.
the
claim
could
have
been
drafted
so
as
to
cover
both
situations
either
in
the
form
of
the
means
claim
such
as
“said
base
plate
having
an
aperture
means
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.”
this
is
drafted
in
the
consultation
with
the
patent
office
i
might
add
or
by
claiming
that
the
base
plate
has
“at
least
one
opening”
through
which
the
draw
strings
are
threaded.
in
deed,
there's
a
means
claim
at
the
end
of
this
very
claim.
the
difference
relates
to
a
functional
aspect
of
the
invention
about
which
it
seems
to
us
the
courts
cannot
confidently
conclude
that
the
more
embracive
claim
would
have
presented
no
differences
in
the
issues
of
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
bader
can.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
as
to
a
nonfunctional
aspect
such
as
if
the
claim
specified
the
color
of
the
base
plate
for
example
and
a
context
which
this
is
obviously
nonfunctional.
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
anyone
to
assume
that
the
grant
from
the
patent
office
is
so
arbitrary
limited
in
the
scope
of
the
monopoly
approved.
here
however,
we
believe
this
kind
of
functional
in
difference
does
invoke
the
principle
of
the
keystone
bridge
case
that
patentees
are
bound
by
the
terms
of
their
claim.
so
our
submission
is
that
amorphous
nature
of
the
equivalence
doctrine
along
with
what
judge
learned
hand
referred
to
in
claude
neon
lights
as
the
vacillation
in
this
court's
decision
attributable

inconsistency

resulted
in
regrettable
uncertainty
as
to
the
permissible

enterprise.
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
discussed
in
our
brief
that
an
unwarranted
zone
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
scope
of
patent
monopolies
can
harmfully
deprive
the
public
of
the
benefits
of
legitimate
competition.
people
will
still
clear
in
the
zone
of
uncertainty,
a
familiar
principle
and
decisions
of
this
court
in
many
areas.
we
asked
the
court
to
address
itself
to
the
inconsistency
in
precedent
which
is
at
the
root
of
the
present
uncertainty
in
this
area
and
to
bring
coherence
to
this
aspect
of
the
competitive
economy
by
implementing
congressional
patent
policy
in
the
manner
we
have
proposed.
thank
you.
