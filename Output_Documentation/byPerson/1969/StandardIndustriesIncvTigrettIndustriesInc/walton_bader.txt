mr.
walton
bader
thank
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
patent
license
agreement
which
are
centered
into
between
the
petitioner
standard
industries
and
the
respondent
tigrett
industries.
the
agreement
provided
that
standard
industries
was
to
pay
in
effect
a
royalty
of
5%
of
the
covered
product
sales
price
which
is
the
way
the
contract
read.
and
the
contract
provided
also
the
usual
warranty
of
title.
the
patent
was
in
fact
in
the
name
of
tigrett
industries,
but
the
assignment
was
a
conditional
one.
the
agreement
of
assignment
between
tigrett
industries
and
the
inventor,
provided
that
the
assignment
would
become
absolutely
void
if
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
now
on
december
29,
1964
after
this
contract
had
been
entered
into,
the
tigrett
industries
assigned
a
patent
involved
to
a
subsidiary
of
the
petition
and
known
as
jackson
furniture
company
which
company
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
and
that
assignment
provide
that
the
jackson
furniture
company,
the
purchaser
agrees
to
abide
by
all
the
obligations
terms
and
conditions
of
a
semi
herein
tigrett
industries
inc.
as
more
specifically
set
forth
in
an
agreement
dated
july
19,
1961
which
was
the
original
assignment
that
i've
previously
mentioned.
thereafter,
on
december
22
--
i'm
sorry
thereafter
on
april
26,
1965,
tigrett
industries
did
make
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
and
it
was
the
position
of
standard
industries
at
that
point
that
the
agreement
became
absolutely
void
by
recent
of
that
fact.
standard
industries
then
failed
to
pay
royalties
in
connection
with
the
patent
involved
and
a
suite
was
brought.
and
there
were
various
claims
that
were
made
by
tigrett
industries
before
the
trial
court.
we
don't
have
to
go
into
those
details.
they
sort
reformation
of
a
contract,
sought
royalties
on
every
item
that
jackson
furniture
corporation
had
made.
but
when
the
trial
court
got
through,
the
trial
court
held
that
there
were
two
items
that
was
subject
to
royalties.
one
known
is
the
play
around,
the
other
known
is
the
golden
converter.
insofar
as
the
play
around
is
concerned,
standard
industries
does
not
contest
the
validity
of
that
patent
or
the
coverage
with
respect
to
the
patent
applicable
to
the
play
around.
however,
standard
industry
does
contest
any
coverage
with
respect
to
the
patent
involving
the
golden
convertible.
and
that
is
the
issue
which
i
am
going
to
address
myself
to
for
a
few
months.
it
was
conceded
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
appellant
court
that
the
patent
involved
which
is
patent
number
3,162,865
did
not
have
any
claim
that
specifically
covered
the
structure.
because
the
claim
of
a
patent,
the
broadest
claim
in
the
case
required
that
they
were
had
to
be
a
pair
of
space
openings
in
the
base
plate
of
the
plate
patent
and
that
draw
springs
have
to
pass
through
this
space
openings.
the
trial
court
however
held
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
terms
of
the
claim
did
not
cover
the
structure.
nevertheless,
by
reason
of
an
application
and
i
believe
a
misapplication
of
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
as
the
law
presently
stands
at
the
present
time
that
this
patent
still
read
on
the
golden
convertible
structure.
now
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
in
my
argument
whether
--
in
detail,
whether
or
not
the
court
should
announce
a
new
doctrine
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
mr.
walton
bader
i
support
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
walton
bader
no
but
he
failed
an
amicus
brief.
mr.
walton
bader
i
adopt
the
position
taken
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
amicus
brief
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
also
wish
to
address
some
other
remarks
in
connection
with
this.
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
doctrine
should
be
implicated
because
this
doctrine
is
actually
causing
a
break
upon
technology
in
the
united
states.
the
reason
is
this,
normally
when
a
competitor
wishes
to
go
into
a
field
where
a
company
has
a
dominating
patent
position.
he
will
come
to
this
patent
accounts
when
he
will
say,
“these
are
the
dominating
patents
in
the
field.
how
can
i
avoid
these
patents?”
and
what
the
patent
attorney
normally
does,
he
studies
the
claims
of
the
patents
involved
and
attempts
--
and
through
the
engineers
of
the
company
involved
and
technical
personnel
attempts
to
create
structures
which
will
avoid
the
patented
claims
and
these
is
what
produces
technical
progress
because
the
man
produces
a
structure
which
in
many
cases
is
superior
to
the
patent
structure.
mr.
walton
bader
i
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart
for
this
reason.
in
the
patent
--
mr.
walton
bader
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
white.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
the
court
did
was
to
abrogate
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
for
this
reason.
there
are
two
ways
that
we
can
--
you
can
claim
a
structure.
there
is
a
what
we
call
abstract
claimology
and
there
is
concrete
claimology
and
these
things
are
different.
for
example,
if
i
wish
to
claim
two
gears
which
are
meshing
to
get.
if
i
claim
this
concretely,
i
will
say
a
pair
of
interconnected
gears.
now
that
is
the
method
that
is
used
by
the
germans
in
claiming
patents
and
in
setting
forth
claims,
and
the
germans
give
a
very
worrying
doctrine
of
equipments
to
such
a
structure.
that
is
a
pair
of
gears
would
also
cover
a
belt
and
a
pulley.
but
in
our
patent
law,
in
view
of
the
provision
of
the
patent
act
of
1952
which
permitted
claiming
of
means
plus
a
function.
i
submit
that
congress
intended
to
permit
abstract
claims
but
with
no
doctrine
of
equivalence.
that
is
--
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice
white
they
didn't.
mr.
walton
bader
no
they
did
not.
i
admit
to
the
court
that
they
did
not.
this
is
basically
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
taking
whether
or
not
this
petition
--
this
position
will
be
sustained
by
the
court
is
of
course
something
that
--
mr.
walton
bader
well
in
--
mr.
justice
burger
in
halliburton
versus
walker,
the
supreme
court
specifically
rejected
claims
drawn
to
means
plus
a
function.
and
therefore
with
that
decision
on
the
books,
it
would
be
impossible
to
draw
an
abstract
claim
that
would
be
held
valid
by
the
court
in
view
of
the
halliburton
case.
and
the
patent
act
of
1952
when
they
put
in
the
illustration
that
claims
could
be
made
by
means
plus
a
function.
they
did
that
in
order
to
permit
this
type
of
abstract
claim
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
since
that
now
was
no
longer
necessary
to
have
a
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
order
to
properly
claim
a
subject
matter
that
congress
by
implication
did
say
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
no
longer
had
any
application.
and
that
is
the
petition
disposition
on
that
matter.
we
don't
have
--
the
case
here
does
not
have
to
bottom
itself
on
that
issue.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
walton
bader
the
petitioner
does
submit
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
this
case
was
misapplied.
this
court
in
the
case
of
graham
against
deere
which
is
the
latest
pronounced
that
i
believe
that
this
court
has
made
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
has
stated
that
where
of
a
subject
matter
of
a
patent
is
narrowed
that
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
likewise
must
be
very
narrowly
applied.
furthermore,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
cannot
be
applied
if
there
is
what
is
called
file
wrapper
estoppel
in
the
case.
that
is
if
a
patentee
in
order
to
obtain
a
patent,
puts
a
limitation
in
his
claims,
he
may
not
thereafter
say
that
is
a
structure
is
infringing
which
does
not
utilize
this
limitation.
and
i
submit
that
the
file
history
of
this
case
and
the
narrowness
of
the
patent
involved
clearly
indicates
that
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
in
this
case
has
no
application.
i
submit
that
for
this
reason.
the
invention
--
and
i
will
discuss
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
a
moment.
if
the
patent
is
valid
at
all,
it
involves
a
very
narrow
structure
of
being
able
to
pull
two
draw
strings
through
a
whole
in
a
base
plate
from
the
top
rather
than
being
able
to
do
the
same
thing
from
the
bottom.
that's
the
whole
point
of
novelty
in
the
case
because
there
is
a
patent,
a
prior
patent
which
is
adamson
which
shows
the
identical
structure
except
that
the
draw
strings
are
tightened
from
the
bottom
of
the
base
plate
instead
of
being
tightened
from
the
top
of
the
base
plate.
now
with
that
simple
little
improvement
which
frankly
is
--
has
less
of
a
point
of
novelty
that
the
improvement
in
the
supermarket
equipment
case
because
draw
strings
are
draw
strings
and
draw
strings
are
always
pulled
and
netting
tight
and
putting
wholes
in
a
base
plate
to
pull
draw
strings
through
something
that's
always
been
done
before.
two
plus
two
when
added
together
and
they
produce
four.
secondly,
in
the
original
case,
the
patently
attempted
to
get
one
claim
which
was
extremely
broad
and
a
second
claim
which
involved
two
space
openings
in
the
base
plate.
now,
we're
only
using
one
but
this
original
claim
called
for
two,
i
believe
it
was
original
claim
for.
that
claim
was
rejected
by
the
patent
office
on
references.
and
the
patentee
then
amendment
the
claim,
to
say
two
space
openings
in
the
base
plate
with
draw
strings
passing
through
these
openings
and
being
connected
at
the
top
of
the
base
plate
for
manipulation.
therefore,
the
patentee
specifically
obtained
his
claim
by
means
of
two
space
openings.
he
always
requested
from
the
patent
office,
two
space
openings
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
has
no
application
in
view
of
the
clear
file
wrapper
estoppel
in
the
case.
we
now
come
to
the
question
of
lear
against
adkins.
lear
against
adkins
were
decided
by
this
court
approximately
60
days
after
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
this
case.
now
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
tried
while
the
validity
of
the
patent
was
in
effect
involved
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
general
denial
of
the
--
of
royalty
liability
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
could
not
at
that
time
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
because
the
law
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
that
time
as
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
to
the
affect
that
a
patentee,
that
a
licensee
could
not
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed
but
could
only
introduce
prior
add
in
order
to
attempt
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
claims.
under
these
circumstances
obviously
since
that
was
the
law
in
the
sixth
circuit,
there
was
nothing
that
the
petitioner
could
do
to
contest
the
validity.
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice
white
because
--
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
yes
it's
set
forth
specifically
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
white,
perhaps
i
can
find
it.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
yes.
he
said
--
since
both
parties
concede
that
the
patentee
--
that
the
petition,
the
licensee
could
not
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.
therefore,
why
am
i
attempting
to
introduce
evidence
with
respect
to
certain
prior
add?
and
i
said
that
i
was
attempting
to
do
that
in
order
to
show
--
in
order
to
indicate
the
scope
of
the
claims
which
we
were
permitted
to
do
at
that
time.
but
what
i
couldn't
do
is
put
in
anticipating
prior
add
because
that
would
have
done
me
no
good.
mr.
walton
bader
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
in
the
appendix.
if
the
court
can
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
it
appears
on
page
129
a-3
of
the
appendix,
and
it
reads
as
follows.
so
the
court
will
know
where
we
are
going,
we
understand
that
the
defendant
concedes,
they
cannot
attack
the
validity
of
the
patents.
that
being
true,
what
would
be
the
relevance
of
a
prior
patent
that
perhaps
anticipated
the
patent
in
suite
here?
and
my
reaction
to
that
was
scope
of
claims
your
honor.
and
mr.
kalish,
my
learned
brother
said,
we
have
no
notice
at
all
of
anyway
they
want
to
narrow
the
scope
of
these
claims
and
so
on.
mr.
walton
bader
129.3
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
appears
about
--
it's
right
above
the
little
notes
saying
124.
there's
a
124
marginal
note
and
it
appears
right
above
that.
mr.
walton
bader
pardon
me
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
walton
bader
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walton
bader
thank
you.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
burger.
and
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lear
against
adkins,
that
was
the
law
and
that
was
the
solid
law
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
the
time
too.
there
had
been
a
recent
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
approximately
two
months
before
this
case
was
tried
which
said
exactly
that.
that
a
licensee
could
not
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.
mr.
walton
bader
except,
well
the
law
--
the
rule
was
clear
with
this
exception.
there
was
a
provision
that
if
there
was
an
antitrust
violation
in
the
case,
at
that
point,
a
licensee
could
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent.
now,
in
this
case
strangely
enough
there
were
something
that
might
be
considered
an
antitrust
violation
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
provision
which
might
have
been
construed
to
constitute
a
violation
of
law
in
that
unpatented
subject
matter
was
charged
because
there
was
a
provision
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
royalties
provided
--
based
upon
the
profits
provided
that
they
paid
royalties
that
were
less
than
the
profits.
however,
that
provision
never
came
into
effect,
the
provision
may
have
been
severable
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
didn't
rely
on
it,
and
therefore
we
could
not
attack
the
validity.
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice,
no.
the
point
actually,
we
could
not
oppress
it
because
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
was
than
unless
there
was
a
clear
antitrust
violation,
we
could
not
press
the
scope
of
patent
validity
because
of
licensee
estoppel.
and
the
sixth
circuit
case
that
is
cited
in
my
brief
actually
sets
this
thing
forth
very,
very
clearly.
the
sixth
circuit
case
was
almost
on
all
force
without,
and
the
court
specifically
said
there,
you
cannot
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent,
that
is
the
law.
mr.
walton
bader
no.
the
petitioner
did
not,
the
situation
is
as
set
forth
in
the
record
and
of
course
the
petitioner
is
bound
by
his
record.
basically
that
concludes
my
argument,
now
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walton
bader
page
118
a
of
the
appendix,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
got
two
pictures
right
against
that
page
number
and
i
think
that
the
first
picture
shows
a
view
looking
at
the
play
pen
from
the
front
then
there
are
two
details
of
allege
mechanisms
are
figures
two
and
three
which
are
not
particularly
significant.
and
then
figure
four
which
shows
the
bottom
of
the
play
pen
with
the
draw
strings
pulling
the
netting
tight
and
then
figure
5
which
shows
the
playpen
in
up
position
with
the
netting
drawn
tightly.
i
think
that's
probably
best
representation
of
a
patent
invention.
mr.
walton
bader
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
called
to
my
attention
that
there
apparently
is
a
feeling
or
maybe
a
feeling
that
the
non-applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
this
case
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
raised
below
and
raised
very
vigorous
strictly
below.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
first,
the
structure
involved
did
not
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
claims.
secondly,
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
had
no
applicability
to
this
case
because
of
file
wrapper
estoppel
and
number
of
other
defenses.
in
the
appendix
page
44
a
the
trial
court
in
deciding
against
the
petitioner's
contention
had
this
to
say.
we
are
satisfied
from
the
proof.
however,
as
plaintiffs
contend
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is
applicable
here
because
the
two
structures
worked
in
substantially
the
same
way
and
with
the
same
result.
and
then
they
slide
the
graver
case
and
the
great
lakes
case.
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
the
question
was
raised
again
and
where
the
petitioner
urged
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
again
had
no
application,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
fact
that
the
playpen
floor
was
adjusted
up
or
down
by
strings
running
through
the
floor
through
one
hole
rather
than
two
holes
did
not
appear
to
him.
referring
to
the
trial
judge
to
represent
a
substantial
difference,
neither
does
it
to
us
and
again
citing
the
graver
case.
so
there
was
no
question
that
the
non-applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
raised
in
this
case
and
raised
vigorously
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
the
appendix,
page
53
a-11.
it
is
the
second
paragraph
from
the
bottom.
it
is
the
second
large
paragraph
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
refers
to
the
graver
case
as
well.
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
concerned,
the
court
in
its
question
to
me
this
morning
pointed
out
that
we
did
not
feel
that
we
could
raise
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
view
of
the
prior
law
of
the
sixth
circuit.
however,
we
denied
in
our
answer
that
any
royalties
would
do.
and
i
think
that
whenever
a
patent
comes
before
the
court
where
the
validity
does
become
an
issue
because
the
validity
of
this
patent
is
an
issue
if
the
patent
here
is
invalid
there
are
no
royalties
payable
based
upon
lear
against
adkins.
then
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
invalidity
of
the
patent
was
raised
even
though
it
was
not
--
we
did
not
have
a
full
dressed
trial
on
invalidity
as
we
normally
would
do
because
of
the
prior
law
involved.
now,
my
learned
brother
mr.
kalish
made
one
rather
inadvertent
era
in
that
he
said
that
the
paragraph
of
the
agreement
was
paragraph
16
e
--
yes,
mr.
kalish
said
paragraph
16
c
but
the
paragraph
actually
is
16
e
if
it
please
the
court.
16
e
refers
to
this
particular
patent
involved
at
that
time
it
is
specified
as
an
application
number.
the
patent
issued
very
shortly
after
that
contract
--
after
the
contract
was
signed.
it
does
--
it
is
not
a
really
immaterial
distinction
involved.
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
on
the
appendix,
page
62
a
and
paragraph
e
says
on
patent
application
number
124668
dated
july
16,
1961
which
is
actually
the
patent
involved
herein.
paragraph
c
covers
2790978
and
that's
the
one
that
we
are
not
contesting
the
validity
up
in
this
case.
so
that
it
is
actually
the
e
paragraph
that
we
are
concerned
about.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
it
is
identical
language.
i
said
the
error
is
not
immaterial
rather
but
i
though
i
just
call
it
out
on
the
court's
attention.
i'm
sure
it
was
in
advert
--
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
paragraph
number
16
e
mr.
justice.
mr.
walton
bader
at
page
62
a
of
the
appendix.
now,
the
other
situation
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
my
learned
adversary
states
that
this
was
actually
an
assignment
and
not
a
contract.
but
if
we
look
at
the
complaint,
we
see
that
the
complaint
doesn't
sue
us
on
the
assignment.
it
sues
us
on
the
contract,
paragraph
three
saying
tigrett
industries
entered
into
a
contract
with
standard
industries,
the
aforesaid
contract
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
walton
bader
it
really
doesn't,
except
--
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
a
license
and
not
an
assignment
mr.
justice
burger.
mr.
walton
bader
yes.
and
in
that
contract
the
license
provision
is
part
of
the
contract
and
it
really
makes
very
little
difference.
we
have
a
license
provision
that
was
put
in.
the
provision
involved
says
the
following
will
be
--
the
following
arrangement
shall
apply
with
respect
to
the
infant
division
patent
licenses.
and
therefore
the
mere
fact
that
this
license
agreement
is
incorporated
on
the
contract
for
the
sale
of
asset,
assets
makes
no
difference.
it
still
a
patent
license
agreement
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
walton
bader
the
patent
owner
had
own
the
patent
until
subsequently
he
conditionally
assigned
it
to
our
subsidiary
jackson
furniture
corporation
who
interestingly
enough
mr.
justice
burger,
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
now,
if
in
fact
he
wanted
to
sue
on
the
assignment
document
involved,
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
respondent
here
to
have
sued
a
subsidiary
jackson
furniture
corporation.
he
chose
not
too.
he
chose
to
sue
us
on
the
contract.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
fact
that
an
assignment
was
made
subsequently
to
our
subsidiary
would
make
no
difference.
furthermore
of
course
if
in
fact
the
assignment
involved
was
made
to
a
subsidiary,
it
was
still
made
subject
to
the
condition
and
therefore
the
condition
involved
having
not
been
fulfilled
by
reason
of
the
assignment
made
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
entire
assignment
becomes
void
anyway
and
there
is
a
failure
of
title
involved.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
say.
mr.
walton
bader
yes.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
that?
mr.
walton
bader
no
question
about
that.
mr.
walton
bader
no,
it
never
assigned
anything
to
standard.
mr.
walton
bader
it
assigned
the
patent
involved
that
was
licensed
to
jackson
furniture
corporations
subject
to
an
obligation
on
jackson
furniture
corporation
to
pay
royalties.
mr.
walton
bader
after
the
assignment
the
patent
originally
was
owned
by
jackson
furniture
corporation
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation
and
as
soon
as
tigrett
industry
has
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
we
submit
that
the
ownership
of
the
patent
then
went
back
to
johnson
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
no,
there
was
an
assignment
from
the
inventor
to
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
an
assignment
from
the
inventor
to
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
no.
there
was
--
the
license
was
from
tigrett
to
standard,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
my
time
is
up,
can
i
continue?
mr.
walton
bader
the
license
agreement
was
made
between
tigrett
industries
and
standard
industries
with
respect
to
a
patent.
the
patent
involved
was
owned
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
john
burton
tigrett.
mr.
john
burton
tigrett
assigned
the
patent
to
tigrett
industries,
our
licensor
but
with
a
condition
in
the
assignment
that
the
assignment
would
become
void
if
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
after
that
--
mr.
walton
bader
that's
correct.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
correct
and
there
after
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors,
those
are
the
facts.
mr.
walton
bader
may
i
thank
the
court
for
their
indulgence,
this
is
the
first
time
i've
argued
before
this
court.
i'm
sorry
that
i've
been
a
little
nervous.
mr.
walton
bader
thank
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
patent
license
agreement
which
are
centered
into
between
the
petitioner
standard
industries
and
the
respondent
tigrett
industries.
the
agreement
provided
that
standard
industries
was
to
pay
in
effect
a
royalty
of
5%
of
the
covered
product
sales
price
which
is
the
way
the
contract
read.
and
the
contract
provided
also
the
usual
warranty
of
title.
the
patent
was
in
fact
in
the
name
of
tigrett
industries,
but
the
assignment
was
a
conditional
one.
the
agreement
of
assignment
between
tigrett
industries
and
the
inventor,
provided
that
the
assignment
would
become
absolutely
void
if
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
now
on
december
29,
1964
after
this
contract
had
been
entered
into,
the
tigrett
industries
assigned
a
patent
involved
to
a
subsidiary
of
the
petition
and
known
as
jackson
furniture
company
which
company
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
and
that
assignment
provide
that
the
jackson
furniture
company,
the
purchaser
agrees
to
abide
by
all
the
obligations
terms
and
conditions
of
a
semi
herein
tigrett
industries
inc.
as
more
specifically
set
forth
in
an
agreement
dated
july
19,
1961
which
was
the
original
assignment
that
i've
previously
mentioned.
thereafter,
on
december
22
--
i'm
sorry
thereafter
on
april
26,
1965,
tigrett
industries
did
make
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
and
it
was
the
position
of
standard
industries
at
that
point
that
the
agreement
became
absolutely
void
by
recent
of
that
fact.
standard
industries
then
failed
to
pay
royalties
in
connection
with
the
patent
involved
and
a
suite
was
brought.
and
there
were
various
claims
that
were
made
by
tigrett
industries
before
the
trial
court.
we
don't
have
to
go
into
those
details.
they
sort
reformation
of
a
contract,
sought
royalties
on
every
item
that
jackson
furniture
corporation
had
made.
but
when
the
trial
court
got
through,
the
trial
court
held
that
there
were
two
items
that
was
subject
to
royalties.
one
known
is
the
play
around,
the
other
known
is
the
golden
converter.
insofar
as
the
play
around
is
concerned,
standard
industries
does
not
contest
the
validity
of
that
patent
or
the
coverage
with
respect
to
the
patent
applicable
to
the
play
around.
however,
standard
industry
does
contest
any
coverage
with
respect
to
the
patent
involving
the
golden
convertible.
and
that
is
the
issue
which
i
am
going
to
address
myself
to
for
a
few
months.
it
was
conceded
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
appellant
court
that
the
patent
involved
which
is
patent
number
3,162,865
did
not
have
any
claim
that
specifically
covered
the
structure.
because
the
claim
of
a
patent,
the
broadest
claim
in
the
case
required
that
they
were
had
to
be
a
pair
of
space
openings
in
the
base
plate
of
the
plate
patent
and
that
draw
springs
have
to
pass
through
this
space
openings.
the
trial
court
however
held
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
terms
of
the
claim
did
not
cover
the
structure.
nevertheless,
by
reason
of
an
application
and
i
believe
a
misapplication
of
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
as
the
law
presently
stands
at
the
present
time
that
this
patent
still
read
on
the
golden
convertible
structure.
now
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
in
my
argument
whether
--
in
detail,
whether
or
not
the
court
should
announce
a
new
doctrine
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
mr.
walton
bader
i
support
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
walton
bader
no
but
he
failed
an
amicus
brief.
mr.
walton
bader
i
adopt
the
position
taken
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
amicus
brief
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
also
wish
to
address
some
other
remarks
in
connection
with
this.
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
doctrine
should
be
implicated
because
this
doctrine
is
actually
causing
a
break
upon
technology
in
the
united
states.
the
reason
is
this,
normally
when
a
competitor
wishes
to
go
into
a
field
where
a
company
has
a
dominating
patent
position.
he
will
come
to
this
patent
accounts
when
he
will
say,
“these
are
the
dominating
patents
in
the
field.
how
can
i
avoid
these
patents?”
and
what
the
patent
attorney
normally
does,
he
studies
the
claims
of
the
patents
involved
and
attempts
--
and
through
the
engineers
of
the
company
involved
and
technical
personnel
attempts
to
create
structures
which
will
avoid
the
patented
claims
and
these
is
what
produces
technical
progress
because
the
man
produces
a
structure
which
in
many
cases
is
superior
to
the
patent
structure.
mr.
walton
bader
i
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart
for
this
reason.
in
the
patent
--
mr.
walton
bader
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
white.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
the
court
did
was
to
abrogate
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
for
this
reason.
there
are
two
ways
that
we
can
--
you
can
claim
a
structure.
there
is
a
what
we
call
abstract
claimology
and
there
is
concrete
claimology
and
these
things
are
different.
for
example,
if
i
wish
to
claim
two
gears
which
are
meshing
to
get.
if
i
claim
this
concretely,
i
will
say
a
pair
of
interconnected
gears.
now
that
is
the
method
that
is
used
by
the
germans
in
claiming
patents
and
in
setting
forth
claims,
and
the
germans
give
a
very
worrying
doctrine
of
equipments
to
such
a
structure.
that
is
a
pair
of
gears
would
also
cover
a
belt
and
a
pulley.
but
in
our
patent
law,
in
view
of
the
provision
of
the
patent
act
of
1952
which
permitted
claiming
of
means
plus
a
function.
i
submit
that
congress
intended
to
permit
abstract
claims
but
with
no
doctrine
of
equivalence.
that
is
--
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice
white
they
didn't.
mr.
walton
bader
no
they
did
not.
i
admit
to
the
court
that
they
did
not.
this
is
basically
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
taking
whether
or
not
this
petition
--
this
position
will
be
sustained
by
the
court
is
of
course
something
that
--
mr.
walton
bader
well
in
--
mr.
justice
burger
in
halliburton
versus
walker,
the
supreme
court
specifically
rejected
claims
drawn
to
means
plus
a
function.
and
therefore
with
that
decision
on
the
books,
it
would
be
impossible
to
draw
an
abstract
claim
that
would
be
held
valid
by
the
court
in
view
of
the
halliburton
case.
and
the
patent
act
of
1952
when
they
put
in
the
illustration
that
claims
could
be
made
by
means
plus
a
function.
they
did
that
in
order
to
permit
this
type
of
abstract
claim
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
since
that
now
was
no
longer
necessary
to
have
a
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
order
to
properly
claim
a
subject
matter
that
congress
by
implication
did
say
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
no
longer
had
any
application.
and
that
is
the
petition
disposition
on
that
matter.
we
don't
have
--
the
case
here
does
not
have
to
bottom
itself
on
that
issue.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
walton
bader
the
petitioner
does
submit
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
this
case
was
misapplied.
this
court
in
the
case
of
graham
against
deere
which
is
the
latest
pronounced
that
i
believe
that
this
court
has
made
on
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
has
stated
that
where
of
a
subject
matter
of
a
patent
is
narrowed
that
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
likewise
must
be
very
narrowly
applied.
furthermore,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
cannot
be
applied
if
there
is
what
is
called
file
wrapper
estoppel
in
the
case.
that
is
if
a
patentee
in
order
to
obtain
a
patent,
puts
a
limitation
in
his
claims,
he
may
not
thereafter
say
that
is
a
structure
is
infringing
which
does
not
utilize
this
limitation.
and
i
submit
that
the
file
history
of
this
case
and
the
narrowness
of
the
patent
involved
clearly
indicates
that
the
doctrine
of
a
equivalence
in
this
case
has
no
application.
i
submit
that
for
this
reason.
the
invention
--
and
i
will
discuss
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
a
moment.
if
the
patent
is
valid
at
all,
it
involves
a
very
narrow
structure
of
being
able
to
pull
two
draw
strings
through
a
whole
in
a
base
plate
from
the
top
rather
than
being
able
to
do
the
same
thing
from
the
bottom.
that's
the
whole
point
of
novelty
in
the
case
because
there
is
a
patent,
a
prior
patent
which
is
adamson
which
shows
the
identical
structure
except
that
the
draw
strings
are
tightened
from
the
bottom
of
the
base
plate
instead
of
being
tightened
from
the
top
of
the
base
plate.
now
with
that
simple
little
improvement
which
frankly
is
--
has
less
of
a
point
of
novelty
that
the
improvement
in
the
supermarket
equipment
case
because
draw
strings
are
draw
strings
and
draw
strings
are
always
pulled
and
netting
tight
and
putting
wholes
in
a
base
plate
to
pull
draw
strings
through
something
that's
always
been
done
before.
two
plus
two
when
added
together
and
they
produce
four.
secondly,
in
the
original
case,
the
patently
attempted
to
get
one
claim
which
was
extremely
broad
and
a
second
claim
which
involved
two
space
openings
in
the
base
plate.
now,
we're
only
using
one
but
this
original
claim
called
for
two,
i
believe
it
was
original
claim
for.
that
claim
was
rejected
by
the
patent
office
on
references.
and
the
patentee
then
amendment
the
claim,
to
say
two
space
openings
in
the
base
plate
with
draw
strings
passing
through
these
openings
and
being
connected
at
the
top
of
the
base
plate
for
manipulation.
therefore,
the
patentee
specifically
obtained
his
claim
by
means
of
two
space
openings.
he
always
requested
from
the
patent
office,
two
space
openings
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
has
no
application
in
view
of
the
clear
file
wrapper
estoppel
in
the
case.
we
now
come
to
the
question
of
lear
against
adkins.
lear
against
adkins
were
decided
by
this
court
approximately
60
days
after
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
this
case.
now
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
tried
while
the
validity
of
the
patent
was
in
effect
involved
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
general
denial
of
the
--
of
royalty
liability
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
could
not
at
that
time
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
because
the
law
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
that
time
as
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
to
the
affect
that
a
patentee,
that
a
licensee
could
not
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed
but
could
only
introduce
prior
add
in
order
to
attempt
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
claims.
under
these
circumstances
obviously
since
that
was
the
law
in
the
sixth
circuit,
there
was
nothing
that
the
petitioner
could
do
to
contest
the
validity.
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice
white
because
--
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
yes
it's
set
forth
specifically
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
white,
perhaps
i
can
find
it.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
yes.
he
said
--
since
both
parties
concede
that
the
patentee
--
that
the
petition,
the
licensee
could
not
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.
therefore,
why
am
i
attempting
to
introduce
evidence
with
respect
to
certain
prior
add?
and
i
said
that
i
was
attempting
to
do
that
in
order
to
show
--
in
order
to
indicate
the
scope
of
the
claims
which
we
were
permitted
to
do
at
that
time.
but
what
i
couldn't
do
is
put
in
anticipating
prior
add
because
that
would
have
done
me
no
good.
mr.
walton
bader
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
in
the
appendix.
if
the
court
can
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
it
appears
on
page
129
a-3
of
the
appendix,
and
it
reads
as
follows.
so
the
court
will
know
where
we
are
going,
we
understand
that
the
defendant
concedes,
they
cannot
attack
the
validity
of
the
patents.
that
being
true,
what
would
be
the
relevance
of
a
prior
patent
that
perhaps
anticipated
the
patent
in
suite
here?
and
my
reaction
to
that
was
scope
of
claims
your
honor.
and
mr.
kalish,
my
learned
brother
said,
we
have
no
notice
at
all
of
anyway
they
want
to
narrow
the
scope
of
these
claims
and
so
on.
mr.
walton
bader
129.3
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
appears
about
--
it's
right
above
the
little
notes
saying
124.
there's
a
124
marginal
note
and
it
appears
right
above
that.
mr.
walton
bader
pardon
me
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
walton
bader
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walton
bader
thank
you.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
mr.
justice
burger.
and
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lear
against
adkins,
that
was
the
law
and
that
was
the
solid
law
in
the
sixth
circuit
at
the
time
too.
there
had
been
a
recent
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
approximately
two
months
before
this
case
was
tried
which
said
exactly
that.
that
a
licensee
could
not
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent
under
which
he
was
licensed.
mr.
walton
bader
except,
well
the
law
--
the
rule
was
clear
with
this
exception.
there
was
a
provision
that
if
there
was
an
antitrust
violation
in
the
case,
at
that
point,
a
licensee
could
attack
the
validity
of
the
patent.
now,
in
this
case
strangely
enough
there
were
something
that
might
be
considered
an
antitrust
violation
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
provision
which
might
have
been
construed
to
constitute
a
violation
of
law
in
that
unpatented
subject
matter
was
charged
because
there
was
a
provision
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
royalties
provided
--
based
upon
the
profits
provided
that
they
paid
royalties
that
were
less
than
the
profits.
however,
that
provision
never
came
into
effect,
the
provision
may
have
been
severable
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
didn't
rely
on
it,
and
therefore
we
could
not
attack
the
validity.
mr.
walton
bader
no
mr.
justice,
no.
the
point
actually,
we
could
not
oppress
it
because
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
was
than
unless
there
was
a
clear
antitrust
violation,
we
could
not
press
the
scope
of
patent
validity
because
of
licensee
estoppel.
and
the
sixth
circuit
case
that
is
cited
in
my
brief
actually
sets
this
thing
forth
very,
very
clearly.
the
sixth
circuit
case
was
almost
on
all
force
without,
and
the
court
specifically
said
there,
you
cannot
contest
the
validity
of
the
patent,
that
is
the
law.
mr.
walton
bader
no.
the
petitioner
did
not,
the
situation
is
as
set
forth
in
the
record
and
of
course
the
petitioner
is
bound
by
his
record.
basically
that
concludes
my
argument,
now
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walton
bader
page
118
a
of
the
appendix,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
got
two
pictures
right
against
that
page
number
and
i
think
that
the
first
picture
shows
a
view
looking
at
the
play
pen
from
the
front
then
there
are
two
details
of
allege
mechanisms
are
figures
two
and
three
which
are
not
particularly
significant.
and
then
figure
four
which
shows
the
bottom
of
the
play
pen
with
the
draw
strings
pulling
the
netting
tight
and
then
figure
5
which
shows
the
playpen
in
up
position
with
the
netting
drawn
tightly.
i
think
that's
probably
best
representation
of
a
patent
invention.
mr.
walton
bader
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
has
been
called
to
my
attention
that
there
apparently
is
a
feeling
or
maybe
a
feeling
that
the
non-applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
in
this
case
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
raised
below
and
raised
very
vigorous
strictly
below.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
first,
the
structure
involved
did
not
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
claims.
secondly,
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
had
no
applicability
to
this
case
because
of
file
wrapper
estoppel
and
number
of
other
defenses.
in
the
appendix
page
44
a
the
trial
court
in
deciding
against
the
petitioner's
contention
had
this
to
say.
we
are
satisfied
from
the
proof.
however,
as
plaintiffs
contend
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
is
applicable
here
because
the
two
structures
worked
in
substantially
the
same
way
and
with
the
same
result.
and
then
they
slide
the
graver
case
and
the
great
lakes
case.
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
the
question
was
raised
again
and
where
the
petitioner
urged
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
again
had
no
application,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
fact
that
the
playpen
floor
was
adjusted
up
or
down
by
strings
running
through
the
floor
through
one
hole
rather
than
two
holes
did
not
appear
to
him.
referring
to
the
trial
judge
to
represent
a
substantial
difference,
neither
does
it
to
us
and
again
citing
the
graver
case.
so
there
was
no
question
that
the
non-applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
was
raised
in
this
case
and
raised
vigorously
throughout
the
proceedings.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
the
appendix,
page
53
a-11.
it
is
the
second
paragraph
from
the
bottom.
it
is
the
second
large
paragraph
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
refers
to
the
graver
case
as
well.
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
concerned,
the
court
in
its
question
to
me
this
morning
pointed
out
that
we
did
not
feel
that
we
could
raise
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
view
of
the
prior
law
of
the
sixth
circuit.
however,
we
denied
in
our
answer
that
any
royalties
would
do.
and
i
think
that
whenever
a
patent
comes
before
the
court
where
the
validity
does
become
an
issue
because
the
validity
of
this
patent
is
an
issue
if
the
patent
here
is
invalid
there
are
no
royalties
payable
based
upon
lear
against
adkins.
then
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
invalidity
of
the
patent
was
raised
even
though
it
was
not
--
we
did
not
have
a
full
dressed
trial
on
invalidity
as
we
normally
would
do
because
of
the
prior
law
involved.
now,
my
learned
brother
mr.
kalish
made
one
rather
inadvertent
era
in
that
he
said
that
the
paragraph
of
the
agreement
was
paragraph
16
e
--
yes,
mr.
kalish
said
paragraph
16
c
but
the
paragraph
actually
is
16
e
if
it
please
the
court.
16
e
refers
to
this
particular
patent
involved
at
that
time
it
is
specified
as
an
application
number.
the
patent
issued
very
shortly
after
that
contract
--
after
the
contract
was
signed.
it
does
--
it
is
not
a
really
immaterial
distinction
involved.
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
on
the
appendix,
page
62
a
and
paragraph
e
says
on
patent
application
number
124668
dated
july
16,
1961
which
is
actually
the
patent
involved
herein.
paragraph
c
covers
2790978
and
that's
the
one
that
we
are
not
contesting
the
validity
up
in
this
case.
so
that
it
is
actually
the
e
paragraph
that
we
are
concerned
about.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
it
is
identical
language.
i
said
the
error
is
not
immaterial
rather
but
i
though
i
just
call
it
out
on
the
court's
attention.
i'm
sure
it
was
in
advert
--
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
paragraph
number
16
e
mr.
justice.
mr.
walton
bader
at
page
62
a
of
the
appendix.
now,
the
other
situation
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
my
learned
adversary
states
that
this
was
actually
an
assignment
and
not
a
contract.
but
if
we
look
at
the
complaint,
we
see
that
the
complaint
doesn't
sue
us
on
the
assignment.
it
sues
us
on
the
contract,
paragraph
three
saying
tigrett
industries
entered
into
a
contract
with
standard
industries,
the
aforesaid
contract
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
walton
bader
it
really
doesn't,
except
--
mr.
walton
bader
it
is
a
license
and
not
an
assignment
mr.
justice
burger.
mr.
walton
bader
yes.
and
in
that
contract
the
license
provision
is
part
of
the
contract
and
it
really
makes
very
little
difference.
we
have
a
license
provision
that
was
put
in.
the
provision
involved
says
the
following
will
be
--
the
following
arrangement
shall
apply
with
respect
to
the
infant
division
patent
licenses.
and
therefore
the
mere
fact
that
this
license
agreement
is
incorporated
on
the
contract
for
the
sale
of
asset,
assets
makes
no
difference.
it
still
a
patent
license
agreement
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
walton
bader
the
patent
owner
had
own
the
patent
until
subsequently
he
conditionally
assigned
it
to
our
subsidiary
jackson
furniture
corporation
who
interestingly
enough
mr.
justice
burger,
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
now,
if
in
fact
he
wanted
to
sue
on
the
assignment
document
involved,
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
respondent
here
to
have
sued
a
subsidiary
jackson
furniture
corporation.
he
chose
not
too.
he
chose
to
sue
us
on
the
contract.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
fact
that
an
assignment
was
made
subsequently
to
our
subsidiary
would
make
no
difference.
furthermore
of
course
if
in
fact
the
assignment
involved
was
made
to
a
subsidiary,
it
was
still
made
subject
to
the
condition
and
therefore
the
condition
involved
having
not
been
fulfilled
by
reason
of
the
assignment
made
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
entire
assignment
becomes
void
anyway
and
there
is
a
failure
of
title
involved.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
say.
mr.
walton
bader
yes.
mr.
walton
bader
yes
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
that?
mr.
walton
bader
no
question
about
that.
mr.
walton
bader
no,
it
never
assigned
anything
to
standard.
mr.
walton
bader
it
assigned
the
patent
involved
that
was
licensed
to
jackson
furniture
corporations
subject
to
an
obligation
on
jackson
furniture
corporation
to
pay
royalties.
mr.
walton
bader
after
the
assignment
the
patent
originally
was
owned
by
jackson
furniture
corporation
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation
and
as
soon
as
tigrett
industry
has
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
we
submit
that
the
ownership
of
the
patent
then
went
back
to
johnson
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
no,
there
was
an
assignment
from
the
inventor
to
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
an
assignment
from
the
inventor
to
tigrett.
mr.
walton
bader
no.
there
was
--
the
license
was
from
tigrett
to
standard,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
my
time
is
up,
can
i
continue?
mr.
walton
bader
the
license
agreement
was
made
between
tigrett
industries
and
standard
industries
with
respect
to
a
patent.
the
patent
involved
was
owned
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
john
burton
tigrett.
mr.
john
burton
tigrett
assigned
the
patent
to
tigrett
industries,
our
licensor
but
with
a
condition
in
the
assignment
that
the
assignment
would
become
void
if
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
mr.
walton
bader
yes,
after
that
--
mr.
walton
bader
that's
correct.
mr.
walton
bader
that
is
correct
and
there
after
tigrett
industries
made
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors,
those
are
the
facts.
mr.
walton
bader
may
i
thank
the
court
for
their
indulgence,
this
is
the
first

this

a
little
nervous.
