r.
white
so
what
is
the
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
attorney
general
is
not
a
party
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
you?
you
just
adopt
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
the
courts
are
really
free
to
reject
the
doctrine
and
the
equivalence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
might
ask
mr.
justice
white
down
there,
but
--
i'm
mr.
justice
white.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
right.
but,
didn't
congress
enact
the
new
patent
law
in
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
couple
years
after
the
decision
in
this
court
on
equivalence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
certainly
never
mentioned
at

they
certainly
didn't
make
specially
reject
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
even
mention
--
they
didn't
even
mention
the
graver
case
and
any
of
the
commentary
or
anything
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
this
come
out
in
the
pretrial
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
ever
say
anything
about
the
estoppel
doctrine?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
reaffirmed
--
he
reaffirmed,
did
he
not
that
it
would
have
done
you
know
good
to
raise
the
validity
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
position?
