mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
wild
over
lane
patent
law
in
this
case
such
as
file
wrapper
estoppel,
licensee
estoppel,
doctrine
of
equivalence.
when
you
take
away
the
top,
you
have
left
simply
the
bare
issue
of
one
party
attempting
to
get
for
nothing
something
they've
bought
and
agreed
to
pay
for
and
enjoyed.
that's
at
the
bottom
of
this
case.
the
facts
are
not
quite
as
simple
and
my
brother
brader
outlined.
this
is
not
a
simple
straightforward
license
agreement.
this
is
a
purchase
of
entire
business,
respondent
tigrett
industries
sold
its
playpen
business,
children's
furniture
business
to
standard
industries,
the
entire
business,
inventory,
parts,
anything
else.
a
lump
sum
was
paid
down
but
in
order
to
facilitate
the
operations
of
the
purchaser,
will
allow
to
pay
us
it
went
and
the
agreement
was
the
tigrett
would
give
petitioner
a
license
on
the
golden
convertible
patent.
and
standard
would
pay
2%
to
the
seller,
tigrett
industries,
the
company
for
a
period
of
five
years
on
the
toys
or
that
this
patent.
that
was
a
means
and
expedient
whereby
they
could
get
some
of
the
purchase
price
back
and
make
it
easier
on
the
buyer.
the
other
3%
was
paid
to
john
burton
tigrett
who
was
the
original
patent
holder
who
had
sold
his
patent
to
tigrett
industries
of
3%
payment
basis.
so
it
was
2%
for
five
years
to
the
seller
as
consideration
for
the
business.
and
3%
go
to
the
original
owner.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
children's
furniture
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
seller
was
a
jackson
tennessee
company.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
what
the
buyer
did
with
the
buyers
new
york
firm
is
established
a
subsidy
and
jackson
tennessee
to
take
over
the
operations
at
this
file.
so
jackson
fringer
corporation
was
the
subsidy
and
alter
ego
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
so
wrapping
an
environment
of
a
business
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
believe
your
honor
the
contract
reports
of
assets
42
(a)
of
the
appendix
call
for
$105,000.00
down
payment
in
the
balance
fee
and
the
royalties.
so
they
estimated
somewhere
around
the
quarter
of
million
before
they
got
through.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
this
i
do
not
know.
i
wasn't
in
negotiation
that
on
how
they
figured
this
out.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
wasn't
atomized.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
54
(a)
is
the
page
for
the
purchaser
of
assets
in
your
basic
agreement
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
and
clause
16
(c)
relates
to
the
particular
patent
before
this
court's
day.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
no
sir
there
was
no
--
i
think
what
happened
simply
was
that
the
negotiating
party
for
the
seller
had
estimated
what
their
income
indemnities
various
items
in
which
they're
granting
a
license
and
figure
they
get
the
same
thing
for
the
next
five
years.
so
4924
in
that
particular
environment,
secondly
and
most
crucial
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
even
though
paragraph
16
(c)
says
that
seller
will
grant
a
license
to
standard,
the
seller
did
not
in
fact
grant
a
license,
but
in
fact
assign
the
entire
right
title
interest
in
the
patent
to
the
buyer.
at
page
76
(a)
of
the
appendix
is
the
document
of
assignment
with
respect
to
the
golden
convertible
patent
and
the
court
will
see
that
jackson
furniture
corporation
was
a
purchaser.
they
were
not
a
licensee.
they
took
the
entire
right
title
and
interest,
entire
bond
of
rights.
so
if
the
seller
tigrett
industries
had
nothing
left
except
the
whole
or
--
benefit
obtaining
a
payment
as
the
purchaser
succeeded.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
a
license.
we're
dealing
with
the
sale.
we
have
the
situation
here
of
the
buyer
coming
before
the
court
and
arguing
that
the
very
patent
which
it
owns
is
invalid
trying
to
appreciate
and
destroy
its
own
property
which
you
have
four
right
too.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
this
--
if
lear
relates
to
a
license
agreement
your
honor,
not
an
assignment.
in
lear,
the
plaintiff
still
owned
the
building
and
the
--
lear
was
simply
a
tenant.
in
this
case,
the
building
was
sold
completely
outright.
there
wasn't
where
the
purchaser
was
fully
removed,
so
have
a
sale
as
suppose
to
a
running
situation.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
distinction
for
one
reason
that
i
know
of
no
law
which
binds
a
purchaser
from
attacking
the
merchandise
that
whom
we
advice.
in
other
words,
that
i
not
see
where
the
assignee
is
barred,
complaining
that
they
got
that
merchandize.
so
we
could
have
raised
any
issue
we
wanted
to
as
to
the
validity
for
the
court
below
as
long
as
they
owned
the
property
so
the
estoppel
document
seemed
pertaining
in
this
case.
just
passing
lightly
over
this
question
of
contract
cancellation,
i
think
it's
a
very
minor
part
of
this
case
if
that
much.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
sorry
your
honor
certainly.
as
i
understand
the
lear
case
as
i've
read
many
times,
i
hope
i
understand
it.
the
plaintiff
was
the
owner
of
the
patent,
but
granted
a
license
or
right
to
use
to
the
defendant.
title
remained
in
the
plaintiff.
the
doctrine
is
always
broad
black
rid
of
principle,
staple
as
to
a
licensee's
right
to
attack
the
patent
which
is
license
but
under
license
5243
only.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
an
assignment.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
it
may
5258
beginnings
your
honor.
that
that
the
question
of
litigant
go
way
beyond
title
in
this
case
here,
entitled
could
be
one
page
if
you
attack
title
to
a
fact
where
it
leave
it
all
to
many
areas
to
such
as
prior
art
and
other
means
attacking
it.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
tenancy.
they
owned
the
patent.
they
bought
it
and
this
doctrine
gave
them
all
the
rights,
full
title.
they've
owned
this
patent.
it
was
in
that
assignment
and
not
a
license.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
your
honor
i
could
--
a
misunderstanding
but
my
brother
bader
frankly
made
it
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
not
to
miller.
we're
knowledge
your
honor
because
by
brother
brader
simply
conceded
before
the
trial
even
started.
they
couldn't
attack
the
patent
and
that
was
it.
i
have
no
objection
of
that
concession.
i
didn't
say
anything.
i
was
just
quietly
conceding.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
there's
nothing
binding
as
far
i
can
see.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
do
not
know
of
any
law
that
binds
a
purchaser
for
attacking
that
merchandize
that
buys.
if
they
have
right
to
do
it
either
could
be
failure
consideration
or
something
at
that
start
here,
but
this
is
an
assignment
and
not
a
license
and
lear
was
a
straight
license.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
if
there
have
been
some
warranty
or
something
of
that
sort
here,
we
couldn't
give
any
better
warranty
5502
patent
office
gave
less
as
far
as
the
patentee.
but
he
had
--
it
was
assigned
to
him
and
he
had
to
pay
for
as
he
went.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
this
has
been
raised
in
this
case
because
the
lear
case
was
decided
in
june
of
last
year,
on
may
21
of
last
year
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
so
therefore
i
have
assumed
after
this
court
accepted
the
petition
on
view
of
the
holding
in
lear
and
it
wasn't
until
last
fall
that
i
realized
that
doctrine
of
equivalence
could
have
been
interjected
and
the
government
form
in
their
position.
so
the
problem
was
that
the
defendant
wants
go
back
down
and
try
validity
again.
and
as
using
the
lear
case,
it's
sort
of
a
club.
i
feel
it's
improper
for
the
reason
i've
announced
the
court
as
being
assignment,
but
on
the
--
from
arguing
those
standpoint
only
or
argument
sake
alone,
let
us
assume
the
court
does
not
concede
distinction
in
that
point.
i
feel
that
the
record
below
establishes
that
the
defendant
have
the
right
to
make
many
attacks
upon
the
patent
which
it
owns.
the
record
and
petitioner
for
certiorari
makes
certain
reference
as
to
colloquy
between
counsel,
defendant's
counsel
and
the
court
relating
to
the
other
patent,
that
so
called
play
around
patent
which
there
is
now
a
concession
of
no
issue
of
validity
or
infringement.
however,
when
that
patent
before
the
district
court
as
the
record
shows
the
defendants
were
not
reluctant
to
attempt
to
attack
that
patent
upon
the
ground
that
it's
set
forth
structure
imbibing
expired
patent.
the
reference
made
to
page
129
a-3
is
also
colloquy
relating
to
the
play
around
patent
and
not
to
go
to
convertible
patent
which
shows
that
the
defendant
also
knew
that
they
had
the
right
to
come
in
and
bring
other
patent
before
that
court
to
narrow
the
claims.
it's
a
two
well
known
experience
which
this
court
remark
upon
the
lear
case.
consequently,
the
defendants
knew
about
this
possibility
to
attacking
the
patent,
which
is
before
this
court
today.
yet
for
some
reason,
the
district
court,
they
raised
non
of
these
efforts,
made
no
attack
and
that
narrow
the
scope
of
the
claims
that
happened
before
this
court
are
to
bring
an
expired
patents
much
says
even
other
a
squeak
that
there
might
have
been
some
patent
lurking
somewhere
which
would
invalidate
this
patent.
we
had
no
knowledge
and
you
have
no
knowledge
as
of
this
today
of
any
patents
which
invalidate
the
patent
suit.
you
have
never
been
informed
of
one
yet.
the
court
was
never
even
given
a
suggestion.
there
was
no
author
of
introduction
of
any
evidence.
and
therefore,
since
the
defendants
knew
they
had
many
experience
open
to
them
and
did
not
avail
themselves
out.
as
simply
raised
by
the
brief
before
this
court
that
there's
a
invalid
patent
waiting
around
or
somewhere.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
drag
us
all
the
way
back
down
again.
let
them
do
what
they
fail
to
do
the
first
time.
they
had
their
chance.
and
secondly,
we
iterate
our
view
down
on
assignment
there
was
no
barred
at
all.
their
own
self-imposed
concession
was
at
the
wrong
pair.
going
on
to
the
other
--
so
therefore
your
honor
we
feel
that
the
lear
versus
adkins
decision
is
not
applicable
on
the
present
instance
and
should
not
be
anyways
subverted
or
perverted
to
allow
it
to
stretch
in
this
situation
or
there
has
been
an
opportunity
for
the
full
day
at
court
and
yet
not
availed
out
to
raise
the
issue
of
validity.
going
on
to
next
point,
which
briefly
relates
this
problem
of
contract
cancellation
we
have
never
felt
that
this
was
earnestly
urged
by
defendants.
the
sale
was
effective
in
december
‘64.
the
assignment
to
which
i
have
alluded
was
dated
december
22,
1964
and
it
was
not
until
four
months
later,
four
months
after
tigrett
industries
had
divested
itself
of
its
title
didn't
decide
well
but
as
assigned
to
the
banks
here
in
jackson
the
right
to
collect
our
2%
override
which
we
hope
we're
going
to
get
and
for
the
benefit
of
our
creditors.
in
december
1966,
20
months
after
the
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
respondents
are
advised
in
a
very
informal
oral
manner
outside
the
courtroom
that
their
defenses
they
had
no
title
no
longer.
their
title
was
completely
expunged
by
virtue
of
this
assignment.
and
therefore
we
had
no
right
at
all
to
collect
the
money
because
they
had
nothing
to
do.
nothing
they
could
do
about
but
they
lost
the
patent.
we
were
dumbfounded
and
yet
you'll
find
nothing
in
the
pleadings,
which
even
suggest
desperate
offense.
it
was
raised
at
the
trial
below
but
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
party's
until
one
year
after
institutional
suit
and
consequently
we
think
it
understatement
to
call
an
after
thought,
to
call
a
mere
rationalization
for
not
paying
what
they
agreed
to
pay.
their
argument
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
assignment
for
benefit
of
creditors,
the
title
to
the
patent
ceased
and
they
had
lost
the
patent.
their
view
is
if
the
underlying
agreement
were
by
john
burton
tigrett
had
assigned
the
patent
to
tigrett
industries
originally
call
for
the
fact
that
in
the
event
in
that
agreement,
the
purchaser,
not
tigrett
industries
by
name
but
the
purchaser,
if
they
made
an
assignment
to
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
license
in
one
hand
of
that
assignment
and
the
other
would
be
automatically
cancelled.
his
position
of
the
defendants
that
sends
tigrett
industries
made
this
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
four
months
after
they
got
--
after
petitioner
got
title.
the
petitioner
lost
its
rights,
lost
the
title.
the
assignment
at
page
76
a
of
the
appendix
and
my
brother
bader
add
to
the
court
states
that
jackson
furniture
company
agrees
to
abide
by
all
the
obligations,
terms
and
conditions
of
the
seller
as
more
specifically
set
forth
in
the
agreement
dated
july
19,
1961
between
john
burton
tigrett
of
jackson
custody
of
tigrett
industries.
we
contend
that
this
so
called
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
in
an
agreement
was
a
condition
which
petitioner
accepted
and
petitioner
then
stood
in
the
shoes
of
its
assignor
and
that
clause
then
related
only
to
petitioner
and
not
to
the
assigning
party
who
is
no
longer
interested.
just
as
in
corporate
and
contracts,
an
assignment
of
this
type
extinguishes
the
right
of
the
assignor
against
the
third
party
and
substitutes
a
precisely
similar
one
in
the
assignee.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
your
honor
i
would
--
be
please
to
pass
it.
i
just
thought
to
better
bring
it
up
because
it
was
--
they've
have
been
arguing
this
thing
right
along.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
that's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
it's
in
the
briefs
and
raised.
but
i
prefer
to
longer
take
time
at
this
point,
i
don't
think
it's
important
--
the
courts
merit
and
further
rest
on
arguments
in
our
brief
length.
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
matter
of
doctrine
equivalence.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
the
cue
structure
was
the
equivalent
of
that
claim.
at
page
123
-
125
a,
of
the
appendix
there
is
a
photograph
of
the
accused
structure
which
might
be
compared
with
the
drawings
on
page
118
or
112
a
of
the
appendix.
there's
only
one
difference.
one
opening
against
to
the
experts
for
both
sides
found
they
work
the
same
way
to
do
the
same
thing
by
the
same
means.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
not
a
substantial
difference.
my
brother
bader
argues
for
a
very
strict
construction
and
taking
to
its
logical
end
would
only
be
to
subscribe
to
the
view,
which
this
court
denounced
in
the
graver
case
and
that
isn't
only
outright
and
forthright,
duplication
is
a
very
rare
and
dull
thing.
we
have
simply
the
evasion
of
this
patent
by
putting
a
single
hole
instead
of
two.
everything
else
is
the
same
structurally
and
functionally.
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
with
respect
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
equivalency.
therefore,
we
must
address
ourselves
to
the
government's
view
with
which
has
overruled
this
doctrine
and
replace
it
by
a
new
test.
firstly,
it
is
our
view
that
the
government
is
raising
its
own
windmill
or
its
own
scarecrow.
and
it
talks
about
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
3%
would
be
continued
to
be
paid
for
the
life
of
the
patent,
to
john
burton
tigrett
who
was
the
original
owner
who
assigned
the
tigrett
industries
and
they're
repaying
him
3%.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
as
far
as
the
respondent
tigrett
industries
is
concerned,
2%
to
them
was
part
of
the
purchase
price.
the
3%
to
go
to
john
burton
tigrett
was
simply
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
adapt
and
accept
the
obligation,
which
the
seller
had
to
him.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
on
the
3%
to
the
inventor
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
the
2%
was
override
to
them.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
in
our
position,
yes
sir,
yeah.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir
but
as
far
as
the
industry
is
concerned
selling
company
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
you're
right.
the
question
then
would
seem
to
be
your
honor
if
i
understand
it
is
that
whether
or
not
the
patent
might
have
been
held
invalid
by
some
manner
or
means
in
that
period
of
time.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
don't
see
--
i
can't
take
that
position.
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
who
would
know
that
for.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
because
it's
wrong
in
terms
of
a
place
to
a
patent
your
honor.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
if
that
patent
had
been
held
invalid
by
a
third
party
infringement
action
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
we'll
be
hard
put
to
--
on
antitrust
laws
to
ask
them
to
pay
on
an
invalid
fund.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
if
the
third
party
your
honor
had
infringe
his
patent
and
suite
had
to
be
brought
and
say
to
the
purchaser
brought
a
suite
for
infringement
and
by
virtue
of
that
litigation
that
patent
was
held
invalid
prior
to
the
termination
of
five-year
period,
then
i
would
say
in
that
case
we
could
not
expect
them
to
pay
us.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
regrettably
the
contract
is
drawn
in
terms
of
--
accorded
by
the
fact.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
to
estoppel
argument
is
based
upon
and
base
back
to
the
defendant.
in
lear
versus
adkins
the
question
was,
was
the
licensee
stopped?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
by
virtue
of
the
way
that
contract
is
written,
i'll
have
to
say
yes
sir,
otherwise
you
are
going
to
file
that
antitrust
laws.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
he
wasn't
stopped
at
all.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
he
has
not
stopped
at
all.
i
had
no
bar.
i'm
saying
he
had
no
bar,
he
could
have
raised
decision
below
if
he
wanted
to.
in
lear
versus
adkins
you
were
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
bar
against
the
licensee.
i
say
this
part
didn't
affect
him.
he
could
have
raised
it
and
lay
down
below
if
he
wanted
too.
there
was
no
estoppel
against
him.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
oh,
i
think
that
we
had
a
--
that
must
have
held
him
valid
your
honor
because
it
have
been
appearance
of
some
of
the
charge
the
way
contract
is
granted.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
right.
there
was
no
bar
against
him
at
all
the
time.
in
all
difference,
may
i
cite
that
lawyers
not
take
part
in
this
negotiation
unfortunately.
this
contract
have
been
written
differently
we're
stock
with.
getting
back
from
the
government's
position
on
doctrine
of
equivalence,
they
raise
a
scarecrow
and
he
talked
about
the
context
of
the
general
electric
versus
7106
case
in
the
universal
oil
products
case
starting
up
with
some
sort
of
a
boggy
if
we
had
to
be
afraid
off.
now
in
general
electric,
this
court
held
the
claims
to
be
absolutely
invalid
in
that
case
because
they
were
much
too
broad.
the
claim
called
led
to
a
filament
and
limitation
related
to
being
made
up
of
such
large
streams
of
such
size
and
contour
as
to
prevent
sagging
in
7137.
that
that
must
struck
down
because
the
public
could
not
no
where
--
the
line
was
drawn,
so
comprehensive
was
indefinite
and
similarly
in
the
universal
law
of
products
case,
this
court
did
recognize
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
but
held
that
the
process
provide
upon
was
that
which
have
been
denied
to
the
patentee.
those
cases
are
not
pertinent
and
they
set
up
a
very
bad
contacts
within
which
the
exist
a
doctrine
of
equivalence.
the
government
expresses
extreme
anxiety
and
fear
that
the
courts
will
expand
this
claims
of
patents,
in
such
an
extent
that
they'll
trespass
into
areas
which
should
be
denied
the
patentee.
what
is
this
document
actually
get
called
as
such
a
concern
here
today.
it's
a
116
years
old.
it's
been
an
aid
to
the
courts
for
construing
claims
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
fraud,
preventing
a
dissimulation.
this
doctrine
is
sort
of
a
first
class
and
the
doctrine
plain
hands.
this
doctrine
is
designed
to
prevent
a
patentee
from
being
a
victim
of
verbalism
as
expressed
in
the
graver
case.
and
it
is
applied
not
to
capture
something
new
in
different
but
to
avoid
the
accused
structure
of
being
nothing
more
than
a
mere
colorable
difference
from
mere
inconsequential
departure.
to
minimize
as
i
believe
justice
black
used
in
the
dissent
in
the
graver
case.
these
are
not
--
why
is
doctrine
is
not
used
to
encompass
large
areas
but
colorable
differences,
colorable
departures,
inconsequential
changes.
they're
designed
to
prevent
as
the
court
stated
in
the
unscrupulous
copyist.
now
there
are
many
safeguards
in
this
test,
which
perhaps
may
clarify
the
question
that
justice
white
raised
before.
one
test
of
course,
the
test
of
equivalency.
it
must
do
the
same
thing
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
results.
so
we
have
to
have
that
as
one
guard,
safeguard.
secondly,
the
file
wrapper
estoppel
doctrine
is
used
also
as
a
safeguard.
so
if
the
doctrine
applies
in
those
areas
only
were
file
wrapper
estoppel
does
not
attach.
file
wrapper
estoppels
at
the
exact
point
of
criticality,
the
exact
point
invention
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
equivalency
at
that
particular
point.
thirdly,
the
claims
must
be
definite.
the
claims
cannot
be
so
broad
as
to
not
guide
the
public
as
the
general
electric
case.
other
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but
fourthly
and
most
important
is
the
fact
that
the
equivalent
structure
must
have
been
something
known
at
the
time
of
the
patent
are
subject.
it
cannot
be
an
inventive
act.
the
reece
case
in
1871
decided
by
this
court
brought
that
out.
in
1890,
we
have
professor
robinson
and
on
patents
brought
the
same
point
out
that
it
must
be
known
in
the
arts
at
the
date
of
the
patent.
in
the
graver
case,
this
court
made
the
same
statement
that
the
important
factor
is
whether
persons
reasonably
skilled
in
the
art
would
have
known
of
the
interchangeability
of
the
ingredient
not
contained
in
the
patent
with
one
that
was.
it
have
to
be
something
known.
if
it
became
invention
then
it
was
of
course
beyond
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
this
is
also
the
notes
since
1890
in
textbooks.
(inaudible)
brings
that
out.
now
the
government
in
his
brief
at
countless
places
states
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
prevents
inventing
around,
prevents
invention
around.
now
the
use
of
the
word
invention
can't
be
accidental.
it's
used
too
often.
and
what
is
invention?
we
presumed
that
invention
is
what
this
court
held
to
be
in
the
graham
case.
it
must
be
unobvious
and
therefore
if
it
is
unobvious,
it
cannot
be
in
equivalent
because
in
the
equivalent
has
got
to
be
obvious.
consequently
this
doctrine
have
nothing
to
do
with
defending
others
from
being
creative,
from
using
ingenuity,
and
showing
skills
beyond
the
mechanical
skills.
in
fact,
it
encourages
all
of
these
to
do
that.
the
government's
position
would
seem
to
be
to
more
or
less
under
the
guys
of
competition
in
public
policy
to
really
be
encouraging
the
free
loaders,
the
commercial
parasites,
the
uncreative,
the
parts.
this
case
is
an
interesting
case
in
itself
because
we
have
the
purchaser
depreciating
the
novelty
of
the
very
playpen
which
is
selling
to
such
an
extent
we're
here
today
and
yet
it's
saying
it's
not
noble
and
appreciating
it.
as
simple
as
that
might
be,
consequently
this
doctrine
is
not
designed
to
forestall
technological
advancement.
how
can
anyone
with
the
right
mind
say
that
putting
one
hole
instead
of
two
is
a
technological
advance?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
for
further
--
i
take
that
position
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
didn't
think
so,
before
the
distant
here.
i
just
can't
imagine
the
court
or
ruin
this
particular
doctrine.
i
think
the
doctrine
is
vital.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well,
in
a
standpoint
your
honor
the
district
court
relied
upon
the
graver
case
in
holding
his
principles
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
used
and
noting
the
difference,
the
one
hole
or
two
holes
said
it
was
not
a
consequential
difference
which
is
typical
language
used
in
doctrine
of
government
cases.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well,
this
is
--
been
hard
for
us
to
understand
the
government
raising
these
points,
we
felt
that
the
government
has
gone
to
full
circle.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
think
with
the
facts
you've
outlined
that
should
be
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
as
i
understand
the
doctrine
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
i
think
this
is
maybe
one
area
of
confusion
your
honor.
the
mere
fact
that
the
picture
expedient,
let's
say
the
one
hole
against
the
two
holes
in
this
case
here,
you
adopt
the
one
hole.
this
is
no.
there
is
nothing
very
noble
about
that.
so
one
hole,
if
it
had
an
independent
existence
but
one
of
the
public,
the
once
should
put
that
in
this
context
in
the
total
overall
patent
structure
than
it
is
a
new
device.
in
other
words
just
as
in
the
graver
case,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
one
silicate
which
is
well
known
did
not
prevent
the
public
from
using
that
particular
silicate.
but
when
you
substitute
that
silicate
into
the
particular
welding
composition,
the
totality
then
brought
about
a
new
inventive
option.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
wild
over
lane
patent
law
in
this
case
such
as
file
wrapper
estoppel,
licensee
estoppel,
doctrine
of
equivalence.
when
you
take
away
the
top,
you
have
left
simply
the
bare
issue
of
one
party
attempting
to
get
for
nothing
something
they've
bought
and
agreed
to
pay
for
and
enjoyed.
that's
at
the
bottom
of
this
case.
the
facts
are
not
quite
as
simple
and
my
brother
brader
outlined.
this
is
not
a
simple
straightforward
license
agreement.
this
is
a
purchase
of
entire
business,
respondent
tigrett
industries
sold
its
playpen
business,
children's
furniture
business
to
standard
industries,
the
entire
business,
inventory,
parts,
anything
else.
a
lump
sum
was
paid
down
but
in
order
to
facilitate
the
operations
of
the
purchaser,
will
allow
to
pay
us
it
went
and
the
agreement
was
the
tigrett
would
give
petitioner
a
license
on
the
golden
convertible
patent.
and
standard
would
pay
2%
to
the
seller,
tigrett
industries,
the
company
for
a
period
of
five
years
on
the
toys
or
that
this
patent.
that
was
a
means
and
expedient
whereby
they
could
get
some
of
the
purchase
price
back
and
make
it
easier
on
the
buyer.
the
other
3%
was
paid
to
john
burton
tigrett
who
was
the
original
patent
holder
who
had
sold
his
patent
to
tigrett
industries
of
3%
payment
basis.
so
it
was
2%
for
five
years
to
the
seller
as
consideration
for
the
business.
and
3%
go
to
the
original
owner.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
children's
furniture
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
seller
was
a
jackson
tennessee
company.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
what
the
buyer
did
with
the
buyers
new
york
firm
is
established
a
subsidy
and
jackson
tennessee
to
take
over
the
operations
at
this
file.
so
jackson
fringer
corporation
was
the
subsidy
and
alter
ego
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
so
wrapping
an
environment
of
a
business
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
believe
your
honor
the
contract
reports
of
assets
42
(a)
of
the
appendix
call
for
$105,000.00
down
payment
in
the
balance
fee
and
the
royalties.
so
they
estimated
somewhere
around
the
quarter
of
million
before
they
got
through.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
this
i
do
not
know.
i
wasn't
in
negotiation
that
on
how
they
figured
this
out.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
wasn't
atomized.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
54
(a)
is
the
page
for
the
purchaser
of
assets
in
your
basic
agreement
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
and
clause
16
(c)
relates
to
the
particular
patent
before
this
court's
day.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
no
sir
there
was
no
--
i
think
what
happened
simply
was
that
the
negotiating
party
for
the
seller
had
estimated
what
their
income
indemnities
various
items
in
which
they're
granting
a
license
and
figure
they
get
the
same
thing
for
the
next
five
years.
so
4924
in
that
particular
environment,
secondly
and
most
crucial
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
even
though
paragraph
16
(c)
says
that
seller
will
grant
a
license
to
standard,
the
seller
did
not
in
fact
grant
a
license,
but
in
fact
assign
the
entire
right
title
interest
in
the
patent
to
the
buyer.
at
page
76
(a)
of
the
appendix
is
the
document
of
assignment
with
respect
to
the
golden
convertible
patent
and
the
court
will
see
that
jackson
furniture
corporation
was
a
purchaser.
they
were
not
a
licensee.
they
took
the
entire
right
title
and
interest,
entire
bond
of
rights.
so
if
the
seller
tigrett
industries
had
nothing
left
except
the
whole
or
--
benefit
obtaining
a
payment
as
the
purchaser
succeeded.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
a
license.
we're
dealing
with
the
sale.
we
have
the
situation
here
of
the
buyer
coming
before
the
court
and
arguing
that
the
very
patent
which
it
owns
is
invalid
trying
to
appreciate
and
destroy
its
own
property
which
you
have
four
right
too.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
this
--
if
lear
relates
to
a
license
agreement
your
honor,
not
an
assignment.
in
lear,
the
plaintiff
still
owned
the
building
and
the
--
lear
was
simply
a
tenant.
in
this
case,
the
building
was
sold
completely
outright.
there
wasn't
where
the
purchaser
was
fully
removed,
so
have
a
sale
as
suppose
to
a
running
situation.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
distinction
for
one
reason
that
i
know
of
no
law
which
binds
a
purchaser
from
attacking
the
merchandise
that
whom
we
advice.
in
other
words,
that
i
not
see
where
the
assignee
is
barred,
complaining
that
they
got
that
merchandize.
so
we
could
have
raised
any
issue
we
wanted
to
as
to
the
validity
for
the
court
below
as
long
as
they
owned
the
property
so
the
estoppel
document
seemed
pertaining
in
this
case.
just
passing
lightly
over
this
question
of
contract
cancellation,
i
think
it's
a
very
minor
part
of
this
case
if
that
much.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
sorry
your
honor
certainly.
as
i
understand
the
lear
case
as
i've
read
many
times,
i
hope
i
understand
it.
the
plaintiff
was
the
owner
of
the
patent,
but
granted
a
license
or
right
to
use
to
the
defendant.
title
remained
in
the
plaintiff.
the
doctrine
is
always
broad
black
rid
of
principle,
staple
as
to
a
licensee's
right
to
attack
the
patent
which
is
license
but
under
license
5243
only.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
an
assignment.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
it
may
5258
beginnings
your
honor.
that
that
the
question
of
litigant
go
way
beyond
title
in
this
case
here,
entitled
could
be
one
page
if
you
attack
title
to
a
fact
where
it
leave
it
all
to
many
areas
to
such
as
prior
art
and
other
means
attacking
it.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
tenancy.
they
owned
the
patent.
they
bought
it
and
this
doctrine
gave
them
all
the
rights,
full
title.
they've
owned
this
patent.
it
was
in
that
assignment
and
not
a
license.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
your
honor
i
could
--
a
misunderstanding
but
my
brother
bader
frankly
made
it
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
not
to
miller.
we're
knowledge
your
honor
because
by
brother
brader
simply
conceded
before
the
trial
even
started.
they
couldn't
attack
the
patent
and
that
was
it.
i
have
no
objection
of
that
concession.
i
didn't
say
anything.
i
was
just
quietly
conceding.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
there's
nothing
binding
as
far
i
can
see.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
do
not
know
of
any
law
that
binds
a
purchaser
for
attacking
that
merchandize
that
buys.
if
they
have
right
to
do
it
either
could
be
failure
consideration
or
something
at
that
start
here,
but
this
is
an
assignment
and
not
a
license
and
lear
was
a
straight
license.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
if
there
have
been
some
warranty
or
something
of
that
sort
here,
we
couldn't
give
any
better
warranty
5502
patent
office
gave
less
as
far
as
the
patentee.
but
he
had
--
it
was
assigned
to
him
and
he
had
to
pay
for
as
he
went.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
this
has
been
raised
in
this
case
because
the
lear
case
was
decided
in
june
of
last
year,
on
may
21
of
last
year
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
so
therefore
i
have
assumed
after
this
court
accepted
the
petition
on
view
of
the
holding
in
lear
and
it
wasn't
until
last
fall
that
i
realized
that
doctrine
of
equivalence
could
have
been
interjected
and
the
government
form
in
their
position.
so
the
problem
was
that
the
defendant
wants
go
back
down
and
try
validity
again.
and
as
using
the
lear
case,
it's
sort
of
a
club.
i
feel
it's
improper
for
the
reason
i've
announced
the
court
as
being
assignment,
but
on
the
--
from
arguing
those
standpoint
only
or
argument
sake
alone,
let
us
assume
the
court
does
not
concede
distinction
in
that
point.
i
feel
that
the
record
below
establishes
that
the
defendant
have
the
right
to
make
many
attacks
upon
the
patent
which
it
owns.
the
record
and
petitioner
for
certiorari
makes
certain
reference
as
to
colloquy
between
counsel,
defendant's
counsel
and
the
court
relating
to
the
other
patent,
that
so
called
play
around
patent
which
there
is
now
a
concession
of
no
issue
of
validity
or
infringement.
however,
when
that
patent
before
the
district
court
as
the
record
shows
the
defendants
were
not
reluctant
to
attempt
to
attack
that
patent
upon
the
ground
that
it's
set
forth
structure
imbibing
expired
patent.
the
reference
made
to
page
129
a-3
is
also
colloquy
relating
to
the
play
around
patent
and
not
to
go
to
convertible
patent
which
shows
that
the
defendant
also
knew
that
they
had
the
right
to
come
in
and
bring
other
patent
before
that
court
to
narrow
the
claims.
it's
a
two
well
known
experience
which
this
court
remark
upon
the
lear
case.
consequently,
the
defendants
knew
about
this
possibility
to
attacking
the
patent,
which
is
before
this
court
today.
yet
for
some
reason,
the
district
court,
they
raised
non
of
these
efforts,
made
no
attack
and
that
narrow
the
scope
of
the
claims
that
happened
before
this
court
are
to
bring
an
expired
patents
much
says
even
other
a
squeak
that
there
might
have
been
some
patent
lurking
somewhere
which
would
invalidate
this
patent.
we
had
no
knowledge
and
you
have
no
knowledge
as
of
this
today
of
any
patents
which
invalidate
the
patent
suit.
you
have
never
been
informed
of
one
yet.
the
court
was
never
even
given
a
suggestion.
there
was
no
author
of
introduction
of
any
evidence.
and
therefore,
since
the
defendants
knew
they
had
many
experience
open
to
them
and
did
not
avail
themselves
out.
as
simply
raised
by
the
brief
before
this
court
that
there's
a
invalid
patent
waiting
around
or
somewhere.
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
drag
us
all
the
way
back
down
again.
let
them
do
what
they
fail
to
do
the
first
time.
they
had
their
chance.
and
secondly,
we
iterate
our
view
down
on
assignment
there
was
no
barred
at
all.
their
own
self-imposed
concession
was
at
the
wrong
pair.
going
on
to
the
other
--
so
therefore
your
honor
we
feel
that
the
lear
versus
adkins
decision
is
not
applicable
on
the
present
instance
and
should
not
be
anyways
subverted
or
perverted
to
allow
it
to
stretch
in
this
situation
or
there
has
been
an
opportunity
for
the
full
day
at
court
and
yet
not
availed
out
to
raise
the
issue
of
validity.
going
on
to
next
point,
which
briefly
relates
this
problem
of
contract
cancellation
we
have
never
felt
that
this
was
earnestly
urged
by
defendants.
the
sale
was
effective
in
december
‘64.
the
assignment
to
which
i
have
alluded
was
dated
december
22,
1964
and
it
was
not
until
four
months
later,
four
months
after
tigrett
industries
had
divested
itself
of
its
title
didn't
decide
well
but
as
assigned
to
the
banks
here
in
jackson
the
right
to
collect
our
2%
override
which
we
hope
we're
going
to
get
and
for
the
benefit
of
our
creditors.
in
december
1966,
20
months
after
the
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
respondents
are
advised
in
a
very
informal
oral
manner
outside
the
courtroom
that
their
defenses
they
had
no
title
no
longer.
their
title
was
completely
expunged
by
virtue
of
this
assignment.
and
therefore
we
had
no
right
at
all
to
collect
the
money
because
they
had
nothing
to
do.
nothing
they
could
do
about
but
they
lost
the
patent.
we
were
dumbfounded
and
yet
you'll
find
nothing
in
the
pleadings,
which
even
suggest
desperate
offense.
it
was
raised
at
the
trial
below
but
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
party's
until
one
year
after
institutional
suit
and
consequently
we
think
it
understatement
to
call
an
after
thought,
to
call
a
mere
rationalization
for
not
paying
what
they
agreed
to
pay.
their
argument
is
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
assignment
for
benefit
of
creditors,
the
title
to
the
patent
ceased
and
they
had
lost
the
patent.
their
view
is
if
the
underlying
agreement
were
by
john
burton
tigrett
had
assigned
the
patent
to
tigrett
industries
originally
call
for
the
fact
that
in
the
event
in
that
agreement,
the
purchaser,
not
tigrett
industries
by
name
but
the
purchaser,
if
they
made
an
assignment
to
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
license
in
one
hand
of
that
assignment
and
the
other
would
be
automatically
cancelled.
his
position
of
the
defendants
that
sends
tigrett
industries
made
this
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
four
months
after
they
got
--
after
petitioner
got
title.
the
petitioner
lost
its
rights,
lost
the
title.
the
assignment
at
page
76
a
of
the
appendix
and
my
brother
bader
add
to
the
court
states
that
jackson
furniture
company
agrees
to
abide
by
all
the
obligations,
terms
and
conditions
of
the
seller
as
more
specifically
set
forth
in
the
agreement
dated
july
19,
1961
between
john
burton
tigrett
of
jackson
custody
of
tigrett
industries.
we
contend
that
this
so
called
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
in
an
agreement
was
a
condition
which
petitioner
accepted
and
petitioner
then
stood
in
the
shoes
of
its
assignor
and
that
clause
then
related
only
to
petitioner
and
not
to
the
assigning
party
who
is
no
longer
interested.
just
as
in
corporate
and
contracts,
an
assignment
of
this
type
extinguishes
the
right
of
the
assignor
against
the
third
party
and
substitutes
a
precisely
similar
one
in
the
assignee.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
your
honor
i
would
--
be
please
to
pass
it.
i
just
thought
to
better
bring
it
up
because
it
was
--
they've
have
been
arguing
this
thing
right
along.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir,
that's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
it's
in
the
briefs
and
raised.
but
i
prefer
to
longer
take
time
at
this
point,
i
don't
think
it's
important
--
the
courts
merit
and
further
rest
on
arguments
in
our
brief
length.
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
matter
of
doctrine
equivalence.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
the
cue
structure
was
the
equivalent
of
that
claim.
at
page
123
-
125
a,
of
the
appendix
there
is
a
photograph
of
the
accused
structure
which
might
be
compared
with
the
drawings
on
page
118
or
112
a
of
the
appendix.
there's
only
one
difference.
one
opening
against
to
the
experts
for
both
sides
found
they
work
the
same
way
to
do
the
same
thing
by
the
same
means.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
not
a
substantial
difference.
my
brother
bader
argues
for
a
very
strict
construction
and
taking
to
its
logical
end
would
only
be
to
subscribe
to
the
view,
which
this
court
denounced
in
the
graver
case
and
that
isn't
only
outright
and
forthright,
duplication
is
a
very
rare
and
dull
thing.
we
have
simply
the
evasion
of
this
patent
by
putting
a
single
hole
instead
of
two.
everything
else
is
the
same
structurally
and
functionally.
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
with
respect
to
the
fundamentals
of
the
equivalency.
therefore,
we
must
address
ourselves
to
the
government's
view
with
which
has
overruled
this
doctrine
and
replace
it
by
a
new
test.
firstly,
it
is
our
view
that
the
government
is
raising
its
own
windmill
or
its
own
scarecrow.
and
it
talks
about
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
3%
would
be
continued
to
be
paid
for
the
life
of
the
patent,
to
john
burton
tigrett
who
was
the
original
owner
who
assigned
the
tigrett
industries
and
they're
repaying
him
3%.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
as
far
as
the
respondent
tigrett
industries
is
concerned,
2%
to
them
was
part
of
the
purchase
price.
the
3%
to
go
to
john
burton
tigrett
was
simply
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
adapt
and
accept
the
obligation,
which
the
seller
had
to
him.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
on
the
3%
to
the
inventor
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
the
2%
was
override
to
them.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
in
our
position,
yes
sir,
yeah.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
yes
sir
but
as
far
as
the
industry
is
concerned
selling
company
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
you're
right.
the
question
then
would
seem
to
be
your
honor
if
i
understand
it
is
that
whether
or
not
the
patent
might
have
been
held
invalid
by
some
manner
or
means
in
that
period
of
time.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
don't
see
--
i
can't
take
that
position.
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
who
would
know
that
for.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
because
it's
wrong
in
terms
of
a
place
to
a
patent
your
honor.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
if
that
patent
had
been
held
invalid
by
a
third
party
infringement
action
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
we'll
be
hard
put
to
--
on
antitrust
laws
to
ask
them
to
pay
on
an
invalid
fund.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
if
the
third
party
your
honor
had
infringe
his
patent
and
suite
had
to
be
brought
and
say
to
the
purchaser
brought
a
suite
for
infringement
and
by
virtue
of
that
litigation
that
patent
was
held
invalid
prior
to
the
termination
of
five-year
period,
then
i
would
say
in
that
case
we
could
not
expect
them
to
pay
us.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
regrettably
the
contract
is
drawn
in
terms
of
--
accorded
by
the
fact.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
to
estoppel
argument
is
based
upon
and
base
back
to
the
defendant.
in
lear
versus
adkins
the
question
was,
was
the
licensee
stopped?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
by
virtue
of
the
way
that
contract
is
written,
i'll
have
to
say
yes
sir,
otherwise
you
are
going
to
file
that
antitrust
laws.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
he
wasn't
stopped
at
all.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
he
has
not
stopped
at
all.
i
had
no
bar.
i'm
saying
he
had
no
bar,
he
could
have
raised
decision
below
if
he
wanted
to.
in
lear
versus
adkins
you
were
concerned
with
the
problem
of
the
bar
against
the
licensee.
i
say
this
part
didn't
affect
him.
he
could
have
raised
it
and
lay
down
below
if
he
wanted
too.
there
was
no
estoppel
against
him.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
oh,
i
think
that
we
had
a
--
that
must
have
held
him
valid
your
honor
because
it
have
been
appearance
of
some
of
the
charge
the
way
contract
is
granted.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
right.
there
was
no
bar
against
him
at
all
the
time.
in
all
difference,
may
i
cite
that
lawyers
not
take
part
in
this
negotiation
unfortunately.
this
contract
have
been
written
differently
we're
stock
with.
getting
back
from
the
government's
position
on
doctrine
of
equivalence,
they
raise
a
scarecrow
and
he
talked
about
the
context
of
the
general
electric
versus
7106
case
in
the
universal
oil
products
case
starting
up
with
some
sort
of
a
boggy
if
we
had
to
be
afraid
off.
now
in
general
electric,
this
court
held
the
claims
to
be
absolutely
invalid
in
that
case
because
they
were
much
too
broad.
the
claim
called
led
to
a
filament
and
limitation
related
to
being
made
up
of
such
large
streams
of
such
size
and
contour
as
to
prevent
sagging
in
7137.
that
that
must
struck
down
because
the
public
could
not
no
where
--
the
line
was
drawn,
so
comprehensive
was
indefinite
and
similarly
in
the
universal
law
of
products
case,
this
court
did
recognize
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
but
held
that
the
process
provide
upon
was
that
which
have
been
denied
to
the
patentee.
those
cases
are
not
pertinent
and
they
set
up
a
very
bad
contacts
within
which
the
exist
a
doctrine
of
equivalence.
the
government
expresses
extreme
anxiety
and
fear
that
the
courts
will
expand
this
claims
of
patents,
in
such
an
extent
that
they'll
trespass
into
areas
which
should
be
denied
the
patentee.
what
is
this
document
actually
get
called
as
such
a
concern
here
today.
it's
a
116
years
old.
it's
been
an
aid
to
the
courts
for
construing
claims
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
fraud,
preventing
a
dissimulation.
this
doctrine
is
sort
of
a
first
class
and
the
doctrine
plain
hands.
this
doctrine
is
designed
to
prevent
a
patentee
from
being
a
victim
of
verbalism
as
expressed
in
the
graver
case.
and
it
is
applied
not
to
capture
something
new
in
different
but
to
avoid
the
accused
structure
of
being
nothing
more
than
a
mere
colorable
difference
from
mere
inconsequential
departure.
to
minimize
as
i
believe
justice
black
used
in
the
dissent
in
the
graver
case.
these
are
not
--
why
is
doctrine
is
not
used
to
encompass
large
areas
but
colorable
differences,
colorable
departures,
inconsequential
changes.
they're
designed
to
prevent
as
the
court
stated
in
the
unscrupulous
copyist.
now
there
are
many
safeguards
in
this
test,
which
perhaps
may
clarify
the
question
that
justice
white
raised
before.
one
test
of
course,
the
test
of
equivalency.
it
must
do
the
same
thing
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
results.
so
we
have
to
have
that
as
one
guard,
safeguard.
secondly,
the
file
wrapper
estoppel
doctrine
is
used
also
as
a
safeguard.
so
if
the
doctrine
applies
in
those
areas
only
were
file
wrapper
estoppel
does
not
attach.
file
wrapper
estoppels
at
the
exact
point
of
criticality,
the
exact
point
invention
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
equivalency
at
that
particular
point.
thirdly,
the
claims
must
be
definite.
the
claims
cannot
be
so
broad
as
to
not
guide
the
public
as
the
general
electric
case.
other
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but
fourthly
and
most
important
is
the
fact
that
the
equivalent
structure
must
have
been
something
known
at
the
time
of
the
patent
are
subject.
it
cannot
be
an
inventive
act.
the
reece
case
in
1871
decided
by
this
court
brought
that
out.
in
1890,
we
have
professor
robinson
and
on
patents
brought
the
same
point
out
that
it
must
be
known
in
the
arts
at
the
date
of
the
patent.
in
the
graver
case,
this
court
made
the
same
statement
that
the
important
factor
is
whether
persons
reasonably
skilled
in
the
art
would
have
known
of
the
interchangeability
of
the
ingredient
not
contained
in
the
patent
with
one
that
was.
it
have
to
be
something
known.
if
it
became
invention
then
it
was
of
course
beyond
the
doctrine
of
equivalence.
this
is
also
the
notes
since
1890
in
textbooks.
(inaudible)
brings
that
out.
now
the
government
in
his
brief
at
countless
places
states
that
the
doctrine
of
equivalence
prevents
inventing
around,
prevents
invention
around.
now
the
use
of
the
word
invention
can't
be
accidental.
it's
used
too
often.
and
what
is
invention?
we
presumed
that
invention
is
what
this
court
held
to
be
in
the
graham
case.
it
must
be
unobvious
and
therefore
if
it
is
unobvious,
it
cannot
be
in
equivalent
because
in
the
equivalent
has
got
to
be
obvious.
consequently
this
doctrine
have
nothing
to
do
with
defending
others
from
being
creative,
from
using
ingenuity,
and
showing
skills
beyond
the
mechanical
skills.
in
fact,
it
encourages
all
of
these
to
do
that.
the
government's
position
would
seem
to
be
to
more
or
less
under
the
guys
of
competition
in
public
policy
to
really
be
encouraging
the
free
loaders,
the
commercial
parasites,
the
uncreative,
the
parts.
this
case
is
an
interesting
case
in
itself
because
we
have
the
purchaser
depreciating
the
novelty
of
the
very
playpen
which
is
selling
to
such
an
extent
we're
here
today
and
yet
it's
saying
it's
not
noble
and
appreciating
it.
as
simple
as
that
might
be,
consequently
this
doctrine
is
not
designed
to
forestall
technological
advancement.
how
can
anyone
with
the
right
mind
say
that
putting
one
hole
instead
of
two
is
a
technological
advance?
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
for
further
--
i
take
that
position
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
didn't
think
so,
before
the
distant
here.
i
just
can't
imagine
the
court
or
ruin
this
particular
doctrine.
i
think
the
doctrine
is
vital.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well,
in
a
standpoint
your
honor
the
district
court
relied
upon
the
graver
case
in
holding
his
principles
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
used
and
noting
the
difference,
the
one
hole
or
two
holes
said
it
was
not
a
consequential
difference
which
is
typical
language
used
in
doctrine
of
government
cases.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well,
this
is
--
been
hard
for
us
to
understand
the
government
raising
these
points,
we
felt
that
the
government
has
gone
to
full
circle.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
i
think
with
the
facts
you've
outlined
that
should
be
yes.
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
as
i
understand
the
doctrine
--
mr.
ralph
w.
kalish
well
i
think
this
is
maybe
one
area
of
confusion
your
honor.
the
mere
fact
that
the
picture
expedient,
let's
say
the
one
hole
against
the
two
holes
in
this
case
here,
you
adopt
the
one
hole.
this
is
no.
there
is
nothing
very
noble
about
that.
so
one
hole,
if
it
had
an
independent
existence
but
one
of
the
public,
the
once
should
put
that
in
this
context
in
the
total
overall
patent
structure
than
it
is
a
new
device.
in
other
words
just
as
in
the
graver
case,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
one
silicate
which
is
well
known
did
not
prevent
the
public
from
using
that
particular
silicate.
but
when
you
substitute
that
silicate
into
the
particular
welding
composition,
the
totality
then
brought
about
a
new
inventive
option.
