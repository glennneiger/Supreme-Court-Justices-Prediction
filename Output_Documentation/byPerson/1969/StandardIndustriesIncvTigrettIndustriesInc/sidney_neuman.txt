mr.
sidney
neuman
--
of
the
american
patent
law
association
or
the
opportunity,
which
has
been
given
to
us
to
brief
the
questions,
which
are
raised
by
this
assault,
which
the
government
has
made
upon
the
equivalence
of
the
rule,
which
is
now
at
least
a
120
years
old.
i
joined
mr.
kalish
in
saying
that
much
of
the
position
in
fact
a
break
deal
of
the
position
of
the
government
is
a
scarecrow
type
argument.
the
government
has
generalized
and
the
government
over
simplifies
in
making
these
assertions
as
to
what
the
equivalency
rule
means
and
what
the
courts
are
doing
as
a
result
of
a
graver.
there
are
three
or
four
points
which
i
would
like
to
make
at
the
outset
which
my
way
of
thinking
demonstrate
the
--
some
of
the
basic
fallacies
in
the
government's
position.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
government,
there
seems
to
be
suggestion
that
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution
has
something
to
do
with
this
matter
of
equivalency
that
the
constitution
requires
specificity
in
claims.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitutional
clause,
which
relates
to
specificity
in
claims.
secondly,
the
government
has
not
in
a
very
good
historian
as
far
as
the
genesis
of
the
doctrine
is
concerned.
the
government
asserts
that
the
wynon's
case
was
decided
under
a
different
statutory
scheme,
which
did
not
require
specificity
in
claiming.
this
is
not
so.
the
original
patent
act
was
the
1790
act.
there
were
no
claims
required
in
the
patents
granted
in
the
two
or
three
period
that
that
act
was
in
effect.
then
we
had
the
patent
act
of
1793,
which
was
--
came
to
an
end
in
1836
when
the
present
statutory
scheme
came
in
to
be.
now,
between
1793
and
1836
we
did
not
have
in
the
statute
any
requirement
for
claims.
in
fact,
we
had
it
during
that
period
what
we
call
a
registration
system,
not
an
examination
system.
the
examination
system
came
in
to
being
in
1836.
and
the
act
of
1836
contain
language
very
much
like
the
language
which
we
now
find
in
section
112
about
specificity
in
claims.
and
this
is
the
reason
that
the
problem
or
the
debate
came
in
the
wynon's
case
it
was
because
of
the
fact
that
the
1836
statute
required
that
the
patentee
particularly
specify
and
point
out
what
it
was
that
he
was
claiming
as
his
invention
that
you
had
the
division
in
the
court
at
that
time.
you
had
the
minority
who
felt
just
as
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
felt
in
the
graver
case.
that
there
should
be
a
strict
construction
of
the
words
of
the
statute
and
a
strict
construction
of
the
terms
employed
in
the
claim.
and
then
you
had
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
wynon's
case
which
felt
that
there
should
be
some
room
for
construction,
some
liberality
of
construction
and
that
the
claim
should
receive
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
this
was
what
the
debate
was
about
in
the
wynon's
case.
do
we
have
strict
construction
of
patent
claims
or
do
we
have
a
little
broader
construction,
a
little
breadth
as
far
as
the
terms
of
the
claims
are
concerned.
the
other
point
which
i
would
like
to
mention
is
the
assertion
that
the
courts
at
the
present
time
do
not
focus
on
the
claims.
now
we
that
are
in
the
patent
litigation
practice
know
that
we
do
focus
on
the
claims
and
that
the
courts
do
focus
on
the
claims.
another
fallacy
in
the
government's
position
is
the
assumption,
which
is
made
here
that
after
the
court
has
found
that
a
patent
is
valid
or
a
claim
in
the
patent
is
valid,
it
does
not
return
to
the
claim
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
the
infringement
issue.
the
courts
do
not
ignore
the
claims
after
they
have
found
them
invalid
and
instead
when
they
do
take
up
an
equivalency
determination
they
go
back
and
they
reconsider
whether
or
not
that
claim
is
valid.
in
the
light
of
the
prior
art
in
view
of
the
scope
and
the
construction
which
the
court
is
placing
upon
the
claim.
your
honors
are
familiar
i'm
sure
with
the
classical
statement
that
was
made
in
this
court
many,
many
years
ago,
which
is
to
this
effect,
that
which
infringes
if
later
anticipates
if
earlier.
now,
this
means
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
sidney
neuman
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
recess,
i
was
making
the
point
about
the
rule
of
law
which
the
courts
i
believe
never
loose
sight
of
namely
that
which
infringes
if
later
anticipates
if
earlier,
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
it.
but
i've
decided
that
i
would
try
and
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
that
he
put
to
mr.
kalish
about
the
disallowance
of
a
subsequently
filed
application
upon
the
existing
patent
where
the
patent
office
refuses
to
grant
the
second
patent
on
the
ground
that
it
is
obvious
in
view
of
an
earlier
patent.
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
sometimes
an
element
maybe
both
an
equivalent
and
obvious.
sometimes
it
may
be
obvious
but
not
an
equivalent.
sometimes
it
may
be
an
equivalent
but
not
obvious.
the
point
mr.
justice
white
is
this
that
in
the
examination
of
an
application,
the
patent
office
is
looking
at
the
disclosures
of
the
earlier
patents.
and
the
question
of
obviousness
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
new
alleged
claim
subject
matter
is
obvious
or
not
obvious
in
the
light
of
the
disclosures
of
the
prior
act.
the
examiner
does
not
get
into
the
question
of
the
claims
of
the
references
that
he
is
relying
upon.
and
equivalency
comes
in
to
play
only
when
we
are
deciding
the
question
of
infringement
of
the
literal
language
of
a
claim.
obviousness
is
a
mater
of
path
nobility
in
the
light
of
the
disclosures
of
the
prior
patents.
mr.
sidney
neuman
which
are
not
and
it's
entirely
possible
sir
that
something
which
has
been
held
to
be
obvious
in
view
of
an
earlier
patent
could
well
be
held
to
be
in
equivalent
in
a
properly
litigated
situation.
mr.
sidney
neuman
sir
i
have
not
made
any
effort
to
get
into
the
merits
of
this
action
which
is
before
your
honors.
i
have
only
prepared
on
this
subject
of
equivalency,
i
was
not
in
the
case
with
mr.
bader
and
mr.
kalish
and
i
am
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
sidney
neuman
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
playpen
and
there
is
a
claim,
which
relates
to
the
structure
of
the
playpen.
and
this
is
the
question
of
infringement
which
was
before
the
lower
courts
whether
the
accused
playpen
was
an
infringement
of
the
claim
of
the
respondent.
the
lower
courts
held
that
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency
that
one
of
--
well
first
that
i
understand
this
that
there
was
one
structure
which
literally
responded
to
the
claim
and
then
there
was
a
second
structure
which
did
not
literally
respond
but
which
the
courts
below
held
was
an
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
now
on
this
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
courts
presently
are
focusing
on
the
claims,
they
are
doing
exactly
that.
they
start
out
with
the
claims
and
they
finish
with
the
claims.
as
i
said,
they
first
determine
whether
the
claim
is
valid.
and
then
if
there
is
an
equivalency
situation
after
they
have
decided
that
the
accused
structure
is
an
equivalent
and
is
reached
by
the
claim
under
the
doctrine,
then
the
court
goes
back
and
takes
another
look
at
the
prior
art
to
see
whether
or
not
the
claim
thus
construed
is
valid
in
the
light
of
the
prior
art.
now
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
sanitary
refrigerator
case.
there
you
had
exactly
the
same
patent,
the
same
accused
structure.
the
records
in
the
two
cases
were
substantially
the
same,
the
record
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
record
in
the
third
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
the
accused
structure
was
an
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
the
third
circuit
found
that
it
was
not.
and
one
of
the
interesting
thing
about
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
that
that
court
expressly
pointed
out
that
if
they
were
to
give
the
claim
the
breadth
that
the
plaintiff
was
asking
for
that
would
be
invalid
in
view
of
the
prior
art.
this
is
why
in
the
third
circuit,
no
equivalency
was
found.
then
the
two
cases
came
up
here.
this
court
agreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
found
that
the
two
structure
was
an
equivalent.
again,
as
showing
the
great
concern
which
the
courts
always
have
for
the
validity
of
a
patent.
i
would
call
attention
to
smith
versus
snow
where
this
court
found
the
patent
valid,
found
entirely
different
incubator
to
be
an
infringement
of
the
smith
patent
gave
it
a
construction
which
made
other
prior
art
pertinent
which
had
not
been
in
that
case
and
in
the
subsequent
case.
smith
versus
hall
301
us,
this
court
found
the
smith
patent
invalid
in
view
of
this
public
use,
which
had
not
been
in
the
first
case.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
once
you've
given
a
construction
to
a
claim
then
other
prior
art,
other
references
become
material
to
the
broader
scope
which
is
being
given
to
a
claim.
now
the
government
also
says
that
the
doctrine
has
not
been
properly
limited.
we
submit
that
it
has
within
the
time
that
has
been
available
for
research
since
i
learned
that
i
would
take
part
in
this
argument.
i've
had
two
of
my
office
associates
checked
the
citations
of
the
graver
case
over
a
period
of
about
20
years.
they
had
examined
about
200
--
and
i
believe
this
is
something
that
the
court
be
interested
in.
they
examined
about
220
citations
of
the
graver
case.
we
found
this
and
these
are
very
rough
figured
that
roughly
a
128
cases
of
infringement
were
found
where
the
doctrine
was
invoked
and
91
cases
were
found
where
the
doctrine
was
refused.
now
this
is
approximately
56%
to
44%.
i
submit
that
this
shows
that
the
court
had
not
gone
over
board
in
applying
the
doctrine
of
equivalency
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
recent
report
by
senator
mcquillan
headed
the
subcommittee
on
patents
in
the
senate
indicates
that
only
about
28%
of
the
patents
being
litigated
are
being
upheld.
so
you've
got
56%
of
28%
and
it's
a
very
small
number
of
patents
indeed
that
are
getting
the
benefit
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
three
major
points
that
we
make
sir
are
these.
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
the
government's
extraordinary
request.
second,
we
submit
that
there
are
no
cogent
reasons
for
rejecting
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
rule
of
patent
construction
which
has
been
so
long
applied
by
the
court
and
third,
that
the
governments
proposed
alternative
test
is
an
impractical
one
and
is
incomprehensible
unless
it
means
what
we
think
it
means
and
in
that
event
the
government's
proposed
test
is
the
very
same
rule
of
equivalency
which
is
now
being
applied
by
the
court.
as
to
that
first
point,
we
submit
that
the
assertions,
which
have
been
made
about
the
effects
of
the
equivalency
ruler
highly
exaggerated
a
more
fancy
and
imaginary
that
real,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
your
honors
which
submit
the
--
which
support
these
assertions.
first,
that
create
an
enterprise
and
technological
progress
are
being
hindered.
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
in
event
of
efforts
and
commercial
enterprises
are
being
discouraged,
that
competitors
are
being
prevented
from
seeking
to
invent
their
own
that
the
doctrine
has
undermined
the
public
interest
in
competitive
technological
advancement.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
before
this
court
to
support
those
factual
assertions.
we
submit
that
this
matter
should
be
taken
up
by
congress.
if
anything
is
going
to
be
done
about
the
equivalency
rule,
the
congress
is
the
fore
important
and
not
this
court.
mr.
sidney
neuman
sir?
mr.
sidney
neuman
no.
but
your
honor
we
say
that
it
has
been
adopted
by
congress.
there
had
been
any
number
of
patent
statutes
adopted
since
1853
or
1854
and
congress,
we
feel
has
adopted
and
has
embraced
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
decisional
law
for
a
120
years.
the
1952
code
for
the
first
time
specified
what
the
act
of
infringement
consist
of.
the
1952
code
says
that
infringement
shall
consist
of
an
invasion
of
the
patented
invention
and
the
decision
showed
that
the
patented
invention
over
the
years
has
been
the
literal
language
of
the
claims
with
a
reasonable
interpretation.
and
this
is
what
the
patented
invention
means.
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
think
that
it
was
a
general
codification
except
insofar
as
congress
did
something
about
the
mercoid
rule
and
congress
did
--
they
wrote
in
this
additional
provision
in
section
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
well
i
think
the
mercoid
situation
is
one.
and
the
other
one
is
they
tried
to
save
broad
means
clauses
in
view
of
the
halliburton
decision
by
providing
that
it
was
permissible
to
have
a
means
clause
on
the
understanding
that
it
would
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
specification.
and
would
reach
the
specific
embodiment
of
the
specification
and
they
went
on
to
say
and
it's
equivalents
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
don't
think
so.
and
i'm
not
expressing
any
opinion.
mr.
sidney
neuman
your
honor
i
think
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
what
you
did
in
lear.
mr.
sidney
neuman
well
the
difference
here
is
it
is
claimed
sir
that
there
are
certain
ill
effects
to
this
doctrine,
which
we
challenge.
there
is
--
and
it
is
a
matter
for
the
investigative
process
of
the
senate
or
a
congressional
committee
namely
whether
or
not
people
are
being
prevented
from
inventing
their
own.
what
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
don't
think
you
had
the
same
question
there
in
lear.
lear
was
simply
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
licensee
was
stopped
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
license
source
patent.
and
here
we
have
a
rule
of
construction,
which
the
courts
have
been
applying
to
patents
for
a
period
of
a
120
years
and
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
recognized
that
a
patentees
claims
are
to
receive
a
liberal
and
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
matter
that
came
before
you
in
the
lear
case
and
the
attack,
which
is
not
being
made
by
the
government
upon
the
equivalency
rule.
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
being
on
president
johnson's
patent
commission.
we
solicited
and
received
from
all
segments
of
this
country
criticisms
and
proposals
for
our
consideration.
and
no
one
ask
us
to
do
anything
at
all
about
the
equivalency
rule
which
had
been
in
effect
for
100
and
some
odd
years
at
that
time
and
the
matter
now,
the
legislation
is
still
before
senator
mcquillan
and
we
say
that
the
legislation,
which
has
come
since
our
report.
and
we
say
that
the
government
should
go
back
to
senator
mcquillan
and
ask
him
to
investigate
this
alleged
impact
--
the
alleged
impact
of
the
equivalency
rule
upon
the
economy
in
this
country.
mr.
sidney
neuman
we
say
they're
highly
exaggerated.
the
assertions
as
to
the
ill
effects
of
this
doctrine.
mr.
sidney
neuman
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
neuman
--
of
the
american
patent
law
association
or
the
opportunity,
which
has
been
given
to
us
to
brief
the
questions,
which
are
raised
by
this
assault,
which
the
government
has
made
upon
the
equivalence
of
the
rule,
which
is
now
at
least
a
120
years
old.
i
joined
mr.
kalish
in
saying
that
much
of
the
position
in
fact
a
break
deal
of
the
position
of
the
government
is
a
scarecrow
type
argument.
the
government
has
generalized
and
the
government
over
simplifies
in
making
these
assertions
as
to
what
the
equivalency
rule
means
and
what
the
courts
are
doing
as
a
result
of
a
graver.
there
are
three
or
four
points
which
i
would
like
to
make
at
the
outset
which
my
way
of
thinking
demonstrate
the
--
some
of
the
basic
fallacies
in
the
government's
position.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
government,
there
seems
to
be
suggestion
that
the
patent
clause
of
the
constitution
has
something
to
do
with
this
matter
of
equivalency
that
the
constitution
requires
specificity
in
claims.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitutional
clause,
which
relates
to
specificity
in
claims.
secondly,
the
government
has
not
in
a
very
good
historian
as
far
as
the
genesis
of
the
doctrine
is
concerned.
the
government
asserts
that
the
wynon's
case
was
decided
under
a
different
statutory
scheme,
which
did
not
require
specificity
in
claiming.
this
is
not
so.
the
original
patent
act
was
the
1790
act.
there
were
no
claims
required
in
the
patents
granted
in
the
two
or
three
period
that
that
act
was
in
effect.
then
we
had
the
patent
act
of
1793,
which
was
--
came
to
an
end
in
1836
when
the
present
statutory
scheme
came
in
to
be.
now,
between
1793
and
1836
we
did
not
have
in
the
statute
any
requirement
for
claims.
in
fact,
we
had
it
during
that
period
what
we
call
a
registration
system,
not
an
examination
system.
the
examination
system
came
in
to
being
in
1836.
and
the
act
of
1836
contain
language
very
much
like
the
language
which
we
now
find
in
section
112
about
specificity
in
claims.
and
this
is
the
reason
that
the
problem
or
the
debate
came
in
the
wynon's
case
it
was
because
of
the
fact
that
the
1836
statute
required
that
the
patentee
particularly
specify
and
point
out
what
it
was
that
he
was
claiming
as
his
invention
that
you
had
the
division
in
the
court
at
that
time.
you
had
the
minority
who
felt
just
as
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
felt
in
the
graver
case.
that
there
should
be
a
strict
construction
of
the
words
of
the
statute
and
a
strict
construction
of
the
terms
employed
in
the
claim.
and
then
you
had
the
majority
of
the
court
in
the
wynon's
case
which
felt
that
there
should
be
some
room
for
construction,
some
liberality
of
construction
and
that
the
claim
should
receive
a
reasonable
interpretation
and
this
was
what
the
debate
was
about
in
the
wynon's
case.
do
we
have
strict
construction
of
patent
claims
or
do
we
have
a
little
broader
construction,
a
little
breadth
as
far
as
the
terms
of
the
claims
are
concerned.
the
other
point
which
i
would
like
to
mention
is
the
assertion
that
the
courts
at
the
present
time
do
not
focus
on
the
claims.
now
we
that
are
in
the
patent
litigation
practice
know
that
we
do
focus
on
the
claims
and
that
the
courts
do
focus
on
the
claims.
another
fallacy
in
the
government's
position
is
the
assumption,
which
is
made
here
that
after
the
court
has
found
that
a
patent
is
valid
or
a
claim
in
the
patent
is
valid,
it
does
not
return
to
the
claim
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
the
infringement
issue.
the
courts
do
not
ignore
the
claims
after
they
have
found
them
invalid
and
instead
when
they
do
take
up
an
equivalency
determination
they
go
back
and
they
reconsider
whether
or
not
that
claim
is
valid.
in
the
light
of
the
prior
art
in
view
of
the
scope
and
the
construction
which
the
court
is
placing
upon
the
claim.
your
honors
are
familiar
i'm
sure
with
the
classical
statement
that
was
made
in
this
court
many,
many
years
ago,
which
is
to
this
effect,
that
which
infringes
if
later
anticipates
if
earlier.
now,
this
means
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
sidney
neuman
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
recess,
i
was
making
the
point
about
the
rule
of
law
which
the
courts
i
believe
never
loose
sight
of
namely
that
which
infringes
if
later
anticipates
if
earlier,
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
it.
but
i've
decided
that
i
would
try
and
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
that
he
put
to
mr.
kalish
about
the
disallowance
of
a
subsequently
filed
application
upon
the
existing
patent
where
the
patent
office
refuses
to
grant
the
second
patent
on
the
ground
that
it
is
obvious
in
view
of
an
earlier
patent.
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
sometimes
an
element
maybe
both
an
equivalent
and
obvious.
sometimes
it
may
be
obvious
but
not
an
equivalent.
sometimes
it
may
be
an
equivalent
but
not
obvious.
the
point
mr.
justice
white
is
this
that
in
the
examination
of
an
application,
the
patent
office
is
looking
at
the
disclosures
of
the
earlier
patents.
and
the
question
of
obviousness
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
new
alleged
claim
subject
matter
is
obvious
or
not
obvious
in
the
light
of
the
disclosures
of
the
prior
act.
the
examiner
does
not
get
into
the
question
of
the
claims
of
the
references
that
he
is
relying
upon.
and
equivalency
comes
in
to
play
only
when
we
are
deciding
the
question
of
infringement
of
the
literal
language
of
a
claim.
obviousness
is
a
mater
of
path
nobility
in
the
light
of
the
disclosures
of
the
prior
patents.
mr.
sidney
neuman
which
are
not
and
it's
entirely
possible
sir
that
something
which
has
been
held
to
be
obvious
in
view
of
an
earlier
patent
could
well
be
held
to
be
in
equivalent
in
a
properly
litigated
situation.
mr.
sidney
neuman
sir
i
have
not
made
any
effort
to
get
into
the
merits
of
this
action
which
is
before
your
honors.
i
have
only
prepared
on
this
subject
of
equivalency,
i
was
not
in
the
case
with
mr.
bader
and
mr.
kalish
and
i
am
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
sidney
neuman
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
playpen
and
there
is
a
claim,
which
relates
to
the
structure
of
the
playpen.
and
this
is
the
question
of
infringement
which
was
before
the
lower
courts
whether
the
accused
playpen
was
an
infringement
of
the
claim
of
the
respondent.
the
lower
courts
held
that
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency
that
one
of
--
well
first
that
i
understand
this
that
there
was
one
structure
which
literally
responded
to
the
claim
and
then
there
was
a
second
structure
which
did
not
literally
respond
but
which
the
courts
below
held
was
an
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
now
on
this
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
courts
presently
are
focusing
on
the
claims,
they
are
doing
exactly
that.
they
start
out
with
the
claims
and
they
finish
with
the
claims.
as
i
said,
they
first
determine
whether
the
claim
is
valid.
and
then
if
there
is
an
equivalency
situation
after
they
have
decided
that
the
accused
structure
is
an
equivalent
and
is
reached
by
the
claim
under
the
doctrine,
then
the
court
goes
back
and
takes
another
look
at
the
prior
art
to
see
whether
or
not
the
claim
thus
construed
is
valid
in
the
light
of
the
prior
art.
now
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
sanitary
refrigerator
case.
there
you
had
exactly
the
same
patent,
the
same
accused
structure.
the
records
in
the
two
cases
were
substantially
the
same,
the
record
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
record
in
the
third
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
the
accused
structure
was
an
infringement
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
the
third
circuit
found
that
it
was
not.
and
one
of
the
interesting
thing
about
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
that
that
court
expressly
pointed
out
that
if
they
were
to
give
the
claim
the
breadth
that
the
plaintiff
was
asking
for
that
would
be
invalid
in
view
of
the
prior
art.
this
is
why
in
the
third
circuit,
no
equivalency
was
found.
then
the
two
cases
came
up
here.
this
court
agreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
found
that
the
two
structure
was
an
equivalent.
again,
as
showing
the
great
concern
which
the
courts
always
have
for
the
validity
of
a
patent.
i
would
call
attention
to
smith
versus
snow
where
this
court
found
the
patent
valid,
found
entirely
different
incubator
to
be
an
infringement
of
the
smith
patent
gave
it
a
construction
which
made
other
prior
art
pertinent
which
had
not
been
in
that
case
and
in
the
subsequent
case.
smith
versus
hall
301
us,
this
court
found
the
smith
patent
invalid
in
view
of
this
public
use,
which
had
not
been
in
the
first
case.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
once
you've
given
a
construction
to
a
claim
then
other
prior
art,
other
references
become
material
to
the
broader
scope
which
is
being
given
to
a
claim.
now
the
government
also
says
that
the
doctrine
has
not
been
properly
limited.
we
submit
that
it
has
within
the
time
that
has
been
available
for
research
since
i
learned
that
i
would
take
part
in
this
argument.
i've
had
two
of
my
office
associates
checked
the
citations
of
the
graver
case
over
a
period
of
about
20
years.
they
had
examined
about
200
--
and
i
believe
this
is
something
that
the
court
be
interested
in.
they
examined
about
220
citations
of
the
graver
case.
we
found
this
and
these
are
very
rough
figured
that
roughly
a
128
cases
of
infringement
were
found
where
the
doctrine
was
invoked
and
91
cases
were
found
where
the
doctrine
was
refused.
now
this
is
approximately
56%
to
44%.
i
submit
that
this
shows
that
the
court
had
not
gone
over
board
in
applying
the
doctrine
of
equivalency
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
recent
report
by
senator
mcquillan
headed
the
subcommittee
on
patents
in
the
senate
indicates
that
only
about
28%
of
the
patents
being
litigated
are
being
upheld.
so
you've
got
56%
of
28%
and
it's
a
very
small
number
of
patents
indeed
that
are
getting
the
benefit
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
three
major
points
that
we
make
sir
are
these.
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
the
government's
extraordinary
request.
second,
we
submit
that
there
are
no
cogent
reasons
for
rejecting
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
rule
of
patent
construction
which
has
been
so
long
applied
by
the
court
and
third,
that
the
governments
proposed
alternative
test
is
an
impractical
one
and
is
incomprehensible
unless
it
means
what
we
think
it
means
and
in
that
event
the
government's
proposed
test
is
the
very
same
rule
of
equivalency
which
is
now
being
applied
by
the
court.
as
to
that
first
point,
we
submit
that
the
assertions,
which
have
been
made
about
the
effects
of
the
equivalency
ruler
highly
exaggerated
a
more
fancy
and
imaginary
that
real,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
your
honors
which
submit
the
--
which
support
these
assertions.
first,
that
create
an
enterprise
and
technological
progress
are
being
hindered.
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
in
event
of
efforts
and
commercial
enterprises
are
being
discouraged,
that
competitors
are
being
prevented
from
seeking
to
invent
their
own
that
the
doctrine
has
undermined
the
public
interest
in
competitive
technological
advancement.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
before
this
court
to
support
those
factual
assertions.
we
submit
that
this
matter
should
be
taken
up
by
congress.
if
anything
is
going
to
be
done
about
the
equivalency
rule,
the
congress
is
the
fore
important
and
not
this
court.
mr.
sidney
neuman
sir?
mr.
sidney
neuman
no.
but
your
honor
we
say
that
it
has
been
adopted
by
congress.
there
had
been
any
number
of
patent
statutes
adopted
since
1853
or
1854
and
congress,
we
feel
has
adopted
and
has
embraced
the
doctrine
of
equivalency.
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
decisional
law
for
a
120
years.
the
1952
code
for
the
first
time
specified
what
the
act
of
infringement
consist
of.
the
1952
code
says
that
infringement
shall
consist
of
an
invasion
of
the
patented
invention
and
the
decision
showed
that
the
patented
invention
over
the
years
has
been
the
literal
language
of
the
claims
with
a
reasonable
interpretation.
and
this
is
what
the
patented
invention
means.
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
think
that
it
was
a
general
codification
except
insofar
as
congress
did
something
about
the
mercoid
rule
and
congress
did
--
they
wrote
in
this
additional
provision
in
section
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
well
i
think
the
mercoid
situation
is
one.
and
the
other
one
is
they
tried
to
save
broad
means
clauses
in
view
of
the
halliburton
decision
by
providing
that
it
was
permissible
to
have
a
means
clause
on
the
understanding
that
it
would
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
specification.
and
would
reach
the
specific
embodiment
of
the
specification
and
they
went
on
to
say
and
it's
equivalents
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
don't
think
so.
and
i'm
not
expressing
any
opinion.
mr.
sidney
neuman
your
honor
i
think
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
what
you
did
in
lear.
mr.
sidney
neuman
well
the
difference
here
is
it
is
claimed
sir
that
there
are
certain
ill
effects
to
this
doctrine,
which
we
challenge.
there
is
--
and
it
is
a
matter
for
the
investigative
process
of
the
senate
or
a
congressional
committee
namely
whether
or
not
people
are
being
prevented
from
inventing
their
own.
what
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sidney
neuman
i
don't
think
you
had
the
same
question
there
in
lear.
lear
was
simply
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
licensee
was
stopped
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
license
source
patent.
and
here
we
have
a
rule
of
construction,
which
the
courts
have
been
applying
to
patents
for
a
period
of
a
120
years
and
this
court
time
and
time
again
has
recognized
that
a
patentees
claims
are
to
receive
a
liberal
and
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
matter
that
came
before
you
in
the
lear
case
and
the
attack,
which
is
not
being
made
by
the
government
upon
the
equivalency
rule.
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
being
on
president
johnson's
patent
commission.
we
solicited
and
received
from
all
segments
of
this
country
criticisms
and
proposals
for
our
consideration.
and
no
one
ask
us
to
do
anything
at
all
about
the
equivalency
rule
which
had
been
in
effect
for
100
and
some
odd
years
at
that
time
and
the
matter
now,
the
legislation
is
still
before
senator
mcquillan
and
we
say
that
the
legislation,
which
has
come
since
our
report.
and
we
say
that
the
government
should
go
back
to
senator
mcquillan
and
ask
him
to
investigate
this
alleged
impact
--
the
alleged
impact
of
the
equivalency
rule
upon
the
economy
in
this
country.
mr.
sidney
neuman
we
say
they're
highly
exaggerated.
the
assertions
as
to
the
ill
effects
of
this
doctrine.
mr.
sidney
neuman
thank
you.
