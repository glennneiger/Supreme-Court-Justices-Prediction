the
differentials
come
off
the
top
so
to
speak?
justice
potter
stewart
why
could
they
do
that
just
because
of
their
geographical
location?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
can't
and
how
the
cows
know
that?
justice
potter

where
are
you

i
have
it
now,
thank

your
phrase
--
when
you
talked
about
this
phrase,
you're
talking
about
the
one
appearing
at
--
on
the
bottom
line
of
the
page
3?
justice
potter
stewart
market
differentials?
justice
potter
stewart
applied
by
the
handlers.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
voting
one
farmer,
one
vote,
or
does
it
depends
upon
the
size
of
his
herd
or
the
amount
of
his
acreage?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
cooperative
votes
for
its
members,
does
it
do
it
by
block
voting?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that's
the
majority
and
--
in
other
words
like
the
electro
college
in
a
state
and
in
a
presidential
election
if
the
51%
are
for
come
down
on
one
side
and
that
the
propertive
is
it
empower
them
to
vote
its
entire
membership
by
that
side?
justice
potter
stewart
--
49%
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
if
the
majority
but
i
wondered
if
well,
i
guess
you
don't
know
the
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
percentage
under
the
old
regime
was
nearby
producers
for
something
about
8%
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
the
percentage
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
referring
to
the
order
that's
before
us
to
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yet
you're
talking
about
the
connecticut,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
did
exist
under
new
jersey
order
but
that
was
not
out
in
the
blair
case.
justice
potter
stewart
this
order
covers
the
state
of
connecticut
and
powered
also,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
confuses
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
do
not
all
of
state
of
connecticut
as
i
read
it,
its
east
of
the
connecticut
river
plus
the
towns
of
grandview
and
sophia.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
connecticut
market?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
that
the
basic
question
is
one
of
power
for
that
when
he
gets
the
power.
not
what
you
see
now
to
be
addressing
yourself
to
that
he
does
have
power
but
he
exercise
mistakenly
or
wrongly
on
a
wrong
state
by
their
own
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
to
understand
it
that
without
power
--
justice
potter
stewart
put
any
differential.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
the
necessary
surplus
in
the
land
the
lowest
production
period?
justice
potter
stewart
of
that
the
high
production
period?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
other
words,
you
have
peak
periods
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
to
have
enough
production
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ryan
earlier
in
your
arguments,
you
told
us
that
there
are
now
only
two
marketing
orders
is
the
same
these
nearby
differentials.
this
one
and
the
one
governing
the
connecticut
market?
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
i
understand,
it's
your
position
that
no
of
them
should
have
them
because
the
secretary
has
no
power
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
impose
them.
but
that
to
one
side,
what
is
the
reason
from
the
secretary's
point
of
view,
what
is
the
reason
why
other
milk
marketing
orders
do
not
contain
these
nearby
differentials?
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what's
base
milk
means?
justice
potter
stewart
did
that
cost
differential
which
you
imply
that
exist
the
generation
ago?
i
think
that
was
part
this
differential
or
part
of
a
ground
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
represented
if
they
on
the
grounds
in
the
secretary's
submission
here
today?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
the
majority.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
management's
going
to
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
so-called
referendum
is
a
plebiscite
on
the
whole
order
or
all
--
take
it
or
leave
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
would
mean,
that
would
mean
customarily
in
that
marketing
area?
justice
potter
stewart
right
then.
