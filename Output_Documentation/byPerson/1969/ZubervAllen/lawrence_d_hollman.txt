mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
lawrence
d.
hollman,
counsel
for
petitioner's
frederick
t.
zuber
et
al,
seven
nearby
milk
farmers
located
within
the
46-cent
or
nearby
zone
within
the
massachusetts,
rhode
island
milk
marketing
area.
they
and
some
two
thousand
other
farmers
have
been
consistently
for
over
30
years
under
federal
orders
recipients
of
the
nearby
differentials
at
the
identical
race
that
are
now
in
effect
46
cents
and
23
cents
either
under
the
massachusetts,
rhode
island
order
or
under
the
constituent
boston
and
secondary
market
orders
which
were
consolidated
in
1964.
essentially,
these
are
farmers
who
deliver
their
milk
to
urban
centers
within
the
concentrated
populations
of
new
england,
massachusetts
for
example
on
boston,
worcester,
springfield,
brockton,
holy
oak,
fall
river
cities
which
are
fairly
sizeable.
and
one
other
point,
these
nearby
farmers
are
not
the
large
and
affluent
farmers
within
the
marketing
area,
anymore
than
are
the
distant
farmers.
there's
evidence
in
the
original
record
affidavits
that
were
submitted
by
the
seven
nearby
farmers,
file
as
government
exhibit
three
in
support
of
its
opposition
of
preliminary
injunction,
which
indicates
that
their
return
on
investment
is
a
very
neither
one.
and
that
without
the
nearby
differential,
that
could
well
shift
their
neither
profits
to
losses
as
a
result
of
their
dairying
operations.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
the
nearby
differential
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
the
farm
location
differential
either
under
the
massachusetts
rhode
island
milk
marketing
order.
under
the
orders
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
which
was
46
cents
and
23
cents
your
honor.46
cents?right.
of
the
same
identical
rate
under
the
boston
order,
originally
promulgated
in
1937
after
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act
of
37
and
under
the
secondary
marketing
orders
which
will
promulgated
by
the
secretary
in
1949
for
worcester
and
springfield,
and
in
1958
i
believe
for
southeastern
new
england.
approximately
the
same
differentials
were
also
paid
under
the
1936
boston
order
of
the
secretary
and
essentially
the
same
in
subsequence
that
is
the
same
amount
to
the
same
people
were
paid
under
licenses,
boston
license,
issued
under
the
1933
act
or
perhaps
even
more
importantly.
approximately
the
same
amount
was
paid
to
these
nearby
farmers
before
federal
regulation
began
and
here
i'd
like
to
supplement
certain
comments
that
mr.
freidman
made.
before
federal
regulation
commence
in
these
markets,
most
large
for
preponderance
of
the
farmers
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
markets,
both
nearby
and
distant
were
members
of
cooperatives.
these
cooperatives,
the
largest
of
which
i
believe
at
the
time
and
still
today
is
new
england
milk
producers
association,
entered
into
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
handlers
that
started
in
the
20's
and
perhaps
even
shortly
before.
under
these
collective
bargain
agreements,
the
nearby
farmers
receive
a
higher
price
which
in
effect
reflected
the
46-cent
differential
that
they
received
today.
but
the
one
problem
that
develop
with
respect
to
these
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
early
30's
and
why
federal
regulation
was
necessary
and
indeed
why
the
triple
a
in
part
was
pass
was
because
destructive
competition
had
in
sued
within
the
market.
this
was
competition
among
the
handlers
and
let
me
explain
this.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
a
handler
would
agree
to
pay
certain
prices.
a
handler
or
dairy
would
agree
to
pay
certain
prices
to
the
cooperatives.
the
cooperatives
at
that
time
were
also
using
a
system
not
at
all
dissimilar
in
fact
quite
similar
to
the
equalization
fluid
and
blend
price
enforced
today
under
the
secretary's
order.
and
under
that
equalization
and
blending
classified
price
system
in
nearby
farmers
received
a
higher
price
by
approximately
46
cents
per
hundredweight.
but
all
handlers
would
not
enter
into
these
agreements
with
the
cooperatives.
and
as
long
as
you
had
any
significant
number
of
handlers
who
would
not
do
so,
they
could
then
go
to
other
farmers
within
the
market
place
not
numbers
of
the
cooperative,
and
offer
them
a
price
not
equal
to
the
class
i
fluid
milk
price.
but
just
slightly
above
the
blend
price
that
the
cooperatives
were
paying
to
their
members
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
as
a
result
of
that,
they
could
charge
lower
prices
these
outside
handlers
not
members
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
could
charge
lower
prices
to
consumers
and
thereby
increase
their
consumer
markets.
as
a
result
the
coops
who
are
members
of
the
collective
or
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
then
had
to
reduce
their
price
which
means
they
had
to
put
pressure
on
their
producers
to
take
lower
prices
and
this
kept
going
on
and
on.
so
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
as
at
under
the
triple
a
of
33
and
the
35
act
expressly
to
follow
the
same
patterns
that
the
cooperatives
had
followed
and
they
stated
this
in
their
committee
reports.
but
to
bring
all
handlers
in
under
regulation
because
it
is
the
handlers
who
are
regulated
under
the
orders.
not
the
producers
as
such
directly.
a
producers
have
no
right
to
go
into
court
to
appeal
from
an
order
under
the
statute.
their
right
is
established
here
for
example
under
this
court's
holding
and
stark
against
wickard,
to
the
extent
they
can
complain
of
any
diminishment
in
what
they
should
rightfully
or
otherwise,
get
from
the
equalization
pool.
but
the
regulations
is
a
regulation
of
handlers
and
as
long
as
a
particular
farmer
or
groups
of
farmers
sell
to
a
handler
who
markets
some
milk
in
this
market
today
for
fluid
milk
purposes,
that
farmer
gets
the
advantage
of
the
blend
price.
now
in
fact,
the
requirement
here
is
really
quite
minimal
that
is
much
of
the
milk
that
many
farmers
sell
to
handlers
is
use
for
the
lower
price,
manufacturing
purposes;
cheese,
butter,
etcetera.
but
because
their
handler
may
shift
no
more
than
a
25%
of
his
milk
into
the
market
for
fluid
purposes
during
a
few
months
of
the
year,
and
i
believe
15%
during
three
other
months.
that
handler
qualifies
all
his
farmers
for
the
fluid
milk
price,
even
though,
most
or
all
or
large
part
of
their
milk
is
going
for
class
ii
are
manufactured
milk
purposes.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
what
the
interest
is
of
the
nearby
farmers
here
because
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
points
which
reflect
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
on
the
equities
here.
the
nearby
farmers
have
consistently
received
these
differentials
over
the
years
and
always
in
excess
of
transportation
and
handling
cost
savings.
overwhelmingly,
these
orders
have
been
approved
by
referendum
both
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
in
64,
the
boston
order
in
37,
and
the
secondary
market
orders.
each
time,
an
overwhelming
approval
by
farmers
and
farmers
must
vote
to
approve
this
order
by
a
vote
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
farmers
in
the
market.
if
that
vote
is
not
obtained,
there
is
no
regulation.
this
is
a
unique
partnership
between
the
secretary
and
the
farmers
and
perhaps
the
most
salient
point
here
is
that
the
nearby
farmers
who
have
voted
for
this
order
have
always
been
a
minority
of
the
farmers
in
the
market.
the
distant
farmers
have
i
think
consistently
over
the
years
numbered
well
over
50%,
indeed
over
the
two
third
that
is
necessary
to
approved
the
order
that
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
my
understanding
your
honor
is
that
the
system
the
secretary
employs
is
one-farmer-one-vote
by
referendum
and
approving
these
orders.
now,
in
fact
however
your
honor,
the
statute
also
authorizes
cooperatives
to
vote
for
their
members
and
so,
in
this
voting
from
time
to
time,
i
think
quite
consistently
in
fact,
the
cooperatives
due
vote
for
their
members.
the
largest
cooperative
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market,
i
believe
your
honor,
is
still
today
is
nempa
which
is
more
heavily
distant
producers
than
nearby
producers.
the
vote,
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
believe
so
your
honor.
it
would
always
depend
at
any
given
time
on
the
mix
of
nearby
and
distant
farmers.
i
think
quite
clearly
under
the
boston
order
if
it
would
have
carried
anyway
and
i
believe
today,
the
nearby
farmer's
number
no
more
than
one
third
of
those.
now,
it
may
vary
between
one
third
and
40%.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
believe,
well,
i
believe
it
can
do
at
either
way
your
honor.
i
believe
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
if
i
understand
your
question,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
cooperative
may
each
time
internally
ballot
or
request
to
votes
of
its
members
on
this.
i
believe
the
cooperatives
place
their
votes
based
on
what
the
board
of
directors
of
the
cooperative
decide.
i'm
not
sure
of
this
your
honor.
and
i
think,
this
may
indeed
vary
among
cooperatives.
so
obviously,
if
a
cooperative
voted
against
the
interest
of
its
majority,
it
would
be
a
simply
matter
for
the
majority
either
to
leave
that
cooperative
or
to
vote
out
the
board
of
directors.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
don't
know
how
the
internal
workings
of
the
cooperative
is,
no,
your
honor.
the
respondents
have
alleged
that
the
64
consolidation
order
that
change
drastically
the
economics
of
the
markets
place
and
so
far
as
the
nearby
differential
is
concern.
that
simply
isn't
so.
the
46-cent
and
23-cent
differentials
were
retained
in
the
identical
rate
that
they
were
under
the
constituent
orders.
what
did
happen
was
that
as
a
result
of
bringing
into
the
boston
order
which
was
the
by
far
largest
order
here
counting
for
over
75%
of
the
farmers
in
the
market
by
bringing
in
secondary
markets
which
had
high
fluid
use,
the
ultimate
result
for
those
distant
producers,
marketing
in
the
boston
order
just
before
consolidation
was
to
increase
the
amount
of
money
they
receive
in
the
12-month
period
after
consolidation.
three
cents
more
per
hundredweight
in
what
they
had
received
before.
one
other
quite
obvious
reason
that
the
nearby
farmers
are
interested
here
and
indeed,
they
sort
to
intervene
before
the
district
court.
that
intervention
was
denied.
it
was
pursued
on
appeal.
the
motion
for
summary
reversal
was
filed
and
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thereafter,
the
district
court
rendered
it
summary
judgment
below.
at
that
point,
the
nearby
farmers
sought
a
stay
of
the
summary
judgment
order
in
aid
of
their
appeal
on
intervention.
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay,
a
stay
which
already
been
denied
in
effect
to
the
government
by
the
district
court.
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay
but
gave
the
nearby
farmer
applicants
for
intervention,
the
choice
by
mooting
their
appeal
on
the
intervention
point
to
go
--
to
take
--
to
become
interveners
for
the
purpose
of
filing
an
appeal.
not
to
enter
into
the
district
court
proceeding
which
had
already
terminated.
in
effect,
that
was
a
hobson's
choice
since
for
the
nearby
farmers
not
to
have
elected
that
option
would
have
meant
that
the
escrow
fund
would
have
been
distributed
out
to
the
distant
farmers,
farmers
who
would
never
relied
on
it.
as
a
result,
the
nearby
farmers
chose
the
route,
which
enable
them.
one,
to
prosecute
an
appeal
at
that
time
the
government
have
not
noted
an
appeal
and
also
to
move
before
the
district
court
for
a
stay
since
the
court
of
appeals
had
denied
the
state
of
a
nearby
farmers.
the
nearby
farmers
obtained
that
stay
and
that
is
why
there
is
now
and
when
i
say
stay,
i
mean
preservation
of
the
status
quo
on
effect
where
the
escrow,
the
differential
continually
as
computed
and
then
added
to
the
fund.
there
is
now
an
escrow
somewhat
over
$8
million.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
--
that
part
of
the
statute
involving
the
volume
of
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
applied.
we've
commented
at
length
in
our
brief
and
mr.
friedman
is
already
commented
to
you
on
the
uniform
price
irrespective
of
use
portion
of
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
volume
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
apply.
these
are
certainly
crucial
words
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
these
are
price
variation
relating
to
marketing's
of
milk.
not
all
price
variations,
not
any
price
variations
that
might
come
into
existence
after
the
act
was
pass.
they
had
to
be
variations
that
were
customarily
paid
by
the
handlers.
usual
market
variations,
i
believe
that's
what
this
court
in
39
decision
in
rock
royal
referred
to
the
matters
and
they
had
to
be
not
sporadically
applied
by
handlers
before
the
act
was
pass
and
before
the
order,
i'm
sorry,
before
the
order
took
effect.
they
had
to
be
customarily
applied
by
handlers
before
that.
again,
congress
intended
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
of
free
market
competition
that
had
existed
before
1933
and
1935.
the
secretary
has
consistently
interpreted
volume
market
and
production
differential,
marketing
differential
customarily
applied
language
to
enable
him
to
provide
for
the
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market.
this
court
in
rock
royal
20
cents
of
a
25-cent
differential
was
born
by
the
pool
in
rock
royal.
its
not
an
individual
handler
pool,
i
believe
it
was
a
market
pool
but
in
the
pool
born
--
bore
that
20
cents
just
as
the
pool
bears
today,
the
46
cents,
and
this
court
upheld
the
differential
in
that
case.
it
was
not
identical
with
the
differential
involved
here.
it
provided
not
only
for
farm
location
but
said
also
that
farmers
must
deliver
to
plants
located
within
the
nearby
zone.
but
that
impractical
effect
is
always
what
nearby
farmers
have
done
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market.
they
did
so
years
ago
and
we're
advised
today
by
the
market
administrator
in
the
market
that
virtually
all
nearby
farmers
delivered
the
plants
within
the
market's
core
--
close
to
the
major
markets.
we
believe
one
of
the
major
reasons
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
astray
as
mr.
friedman
is
already
commented,
is
that
they
looked
to
--
they
made
erroneous
factual
assumptions.
they
thought
that
the
differential
pre
1937
was
not
one
paid
over
and
above
transportation
and
handling
cost
savings
was
not
one
paid
to
distant
farmers
who
delivered
to
a
nearby
zone.
that
is
factually
incorrect.
and
we
have
pointed
out
at
length
in
our
brief,
pages
51
and
52
that
that
isn't
correct.
your
honor,
if
the
court
pleases,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
for
me.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i'd
like
to
know
if
you
have
more
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
have
15
minutes?
then
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
complete
my
argument
if
the
court
pleases?
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
have
commented
on
the
committee
and
what
the
committee
report
means.
we've
set
forth
the
committee
report
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
and
the
particular
provisions
relevant
here
are
on
page
24(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
green
brief.
frankly,
the
committee
report
language
regarding
market
differential
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
among
other
things,
the
report
language
would
indicate
that
the
differentials
they
were
talking
about
were
usually
paid
in
secondary
markets.
and
i
believe
the
court
in
blair
said
that
market
differential
there
depended
upon
the
nature
of
the
market.
nature
of
the
market
i
believe,
they
thought
of
a
secondary
markets.
but
in
fact,
not
only
the
nearby
differentials
but
the
country
station
differentials
which
respondent
say
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
says,
where
market
differentials
are
those
paid
in
primary
markets
and
traditionally,
they've
been
paid
in
primary
markets.
while
the
lower
court
did
not
get
into
the
question
of
substantial
evidence,
they
certainly
looked
to
certain
excerpts
from
the
evidence
in
analyzing
the
interpretation
and
construction
of
the
statute.
for
that
reason
and
because
we
believe
that
if
this
court
reverses
finding
that
the
secretary
had
the
authority
to
put
a
nearby
farm
location
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market,
then
it
can
at
that
point
dispose
of
this
case
rather
than
remanding
it.
i
should
like
to
comment
and
make
it
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
if
you
believe
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor
that
the
secretary
had
the
authority
and
has
the
authority
today
under
the
market
differential
customarily
applied
language
to
put
a
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
that
is
the
46-cent
and
23-cent
differentials
that
we're
talking
about
here.
this
court
if
you
in
other
words
affirm
the
secretary's
power
reversing
the
lower
court.
there
are
then
possible
questions
of
substantial
evidence
which
has
--
have
been
raised
in
the
initial
complaint
of
respondents
that
have
not
been
passed
upon
by
the
lower
court
here
and
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
district
court.
we
believe
that
even
though
this
is
a
truncated
record
and
it
is
a
truncated
record,
it
contains
only
illustrative
excepts
from
the
administrative
proceedings
in
64
and
in
years
passed
that
there
are
still
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
secretary's
determination
that
a
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island,
marketing
order
was
necessary
and
would
support
market's
stability.
and
in
effect,
this
is
what
he
found
in
proposing
for
referendum
vote
by
the
farmers
and
what
he
had
to
find
them
to
the
statute
that
the
order
with
the
differential
would
promote
market
stability.
commenting
of
the
evidence,
this
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
to
make
a
finding
that
the
order
is
a
whole
would
promotes
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
think,
he
need
only
find
that
the
order
as
a
whole.
this
is
an
integral
--
interweave
of
provisions.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
what
is
being
challenge
here
is
simply
the
nearby
differential
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
no.
i
think
just
the
nearby
different
--
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
they
could
strike
the
nearby
differential
provision.
but
that
the
order
would
still
remain
viable.
we
took
the
contrary
position
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
they
left
the
rest
of
the
order
standing.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
--
what
they
did
is
simply
going
the
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
we
believe
in
short
your
honor
that
they
should
not
have
done
that,
that
it
was
improper
for
them.
but
in
terms,
they
never
commented
upon
the
substantial
evidence
points.
they
commented
only
and
held
only
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
secretary
had
authority
to
put
the
nearby
differential
in
the
order.
they
never
reach
the
question
of
substantial
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
yes,
because
it's
a
separability
clause
in
the
order
and
they
promise
that
their
elimination
of
the
differential
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
the
only
evidence
they
have
before
them
was
evidence
regarding
the
differential,
not
evidence.
there
was
not
administrative
record
before
the
court
regarding
the
entire
order.
they
only
had
select
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well
we
believe
your
honor
that
even
this
excerpts
which
have
been
supplied
and
given
the
consistent
administrative
into
the
both
on
a
basis
of
these
excerpts
and
on
the
basis
of
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
by
the
secretary
over
30
years.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
on
substantial
evidence?
no
your
honor.
the
district
court
judgment
was
limited
to
its
holding
that
on
the
basis
of
blair,
an
injunction
will
be
granted.
i
started
to
say
that
these
marketing
orders
are
not
something
that
once
promulgated
or
left
alone.
they're
delicate
and
very
intricate
complex
of
interrelated
economic
and
marketing
factors.
experts
pay
close
attention
to
them
both
the
secretary
and
experts
within
his
department
and
the
farmers
themselves.
there
are
constant
amendments,
suspensions,
decisions
or
orders
affecting
each
marketing
order.
the
boston
order
and
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
since
1936,
just
two
orders
had
been
the
subject
of
suspensions,
amendments,
decisions
or
orders
208
times
according
to
the
records
to
the
department
of
agriculture.
there
been
some
47
amendments
to
these
orders
over
the
year.
the
farmers
and
the
secretary
together
have
cautiously
and
zealously
observed
the
workings
of
the
order
and
modified
it.
the
provisions
of
it
are
an
instreakably
intermingled.
its
with
that
thought
in
mind
that
we
maintain
that
even
if
the
--
this
court
were
to
believe
that
there
were
questions
regarding
the
statutory
authority
that
it
would
not
be
possible
simply
to
excise
one
provision
from
the
order
and
leave
the
order
standing.
an
expert
from
the
department
of
agriculture,
one
of
the
leading
experts
in
the
dairy
industry,
mr.
herbert
forest
in
an
affidavits
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
which
is
in
our
appendix
in
the
record
here
stated
that
in
his
belief,
the
elimination
of
differential
would
cause
disruption
and
instability
in
the
market
place.
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
order
is
to
promote
market
stability.
and
if
taking
out
this
provision
will
promote
market
instability,
then
this
matter,
if
there
are
questions
regarding
the
secretary's
authority
must
be
remanded
to
enable
him,
we
believe
and
submit
to
determine
what
will
make
the
order
stable.
he
has
other
powers
which
may
accomplish
some
of
the
inherent
economic
values
at
the
nearby
differential,
that
he
can
employ
in
this
regard.
but
we
also
believe
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
addison
against
holly
hills
on
the
basis
of
that
case,
if
there
is
any
question
regarding
his
authority,
a
remand
is
an
order
and
under
this
court's
statement
in
lehigh,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
should
then
be
given
an
opportunity
to
resort
pro
tanto
to
the
escrow
fund,
which
we
believe
in
any
of
the
event
should
be
the
property
of
the
nearby
producers
who
have
relied
on
the
differential
for
so
many
years.
who
have
made
investment
decisions
and
marketing
decisions
on
the
basis
of
the
differential.
i
would
like
now
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may?
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
lawrence

hollman,
counsel
for
petitioner's
frederick

zuber
et

seven
nearby
milk
farmers
located
within
the
46-cent
or
nearby
zone
within
the
massachusetts,
rhode
island
milk
marketing
area.
they
and
some
two
thousand
other
farmers
have
been
consistently
for
over
30
years
under
federal
orders
recipients
of
the
nearby
differentials
at
the
identical
race
that
are
now
in
effect
46
cents
and
23
cents
either
under
the
massachusetts,
rhode
island
order
or
under
the
constituent
boston
and
secondary
market
orders
which
were
consolidated
in
1964.
essentially,
these
are
farmers
who
deliver
their
milk
to
urban
centers
within
the
concentrated
populations
of
new
england,
massachusetts
for
example
on
boston,
worcester,
springfield,
brockton,
holy
oak,
fall
river
cities
which
are
fairly
sizeable.
and
one
other
point,
these
nearby
farmers
are
not
the
large
and
affluent
farmers
within
the
marketing
area,
anymore
than
are
the
distant
farmers.
there's
evidence
in
the
original
record
affidavits
that
were
submitted
by
the
seven
nearby
farmers,
file
as
government
exhibit
three
in
support
of
its
opposition
of
preliminary
injunction,
which
indicates
that
their
return
on
investment
is
a
very
neither
one.
and
that
without
the
nearby
differential,
that
could
well
shift
their
neither
profits
to
losses
as
a
result
of
their
dairying
operations.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
the
nearby
differential
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
the
farm
location
differential
either
under
the
massachusetts
rhode
island
milk
marketing
order.
under
the
orders
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
which
was
46
cents
and
23
cents
your
honor.46
cents?right.
of
the
same
identical
rate
under
the
boston
order,
originally
promulgated
in
1937
after
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act
of
37
and
under
the
secondary
marketing
orders
which
will
promulgated
by
the
secretary
in
1949
for
worcester
and
springfield,
and
in
1958
i
believe
for
southeastern
new
england.
approximately
the
same
differentials
were
also
paid
under
the
1936
boston
order
of
the
secretary
and
essentially
the
same
in
subsequence
that
is
the
same
amount
to
the
same
people
were
paid
under
licenses,
boston
license,
issued
under
the
1933
act
or
perhaps
even
more
importantly.
approximately
the
same
amount
was
paid
to
these
nearby
farmers
before
federal
regulation
began
and
here
i'd
like
to
supplement
certain
comments
that
mr.
freidman
made.
before
federal
regulation
commence
in
these
markets,
most
large
for
preponderance
of
the
farmers
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
markets,
both
nearby
and
distant
were
members
of
cooperatives.
these
cooperatives,
the
largest
of
which
i
believe
at
the
time
and
still
today
is
new
england
milk
producers
association,
entered
into
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
handlers
that
started
in
the
20's
and
perhaps
even
shortly
before.
under
these
collective
bargain
agreements,
the
nearby
farmers
receive
a
higher
price
which
in
effect
reflected
the
46-cent
differential
that
they
received
today.
but
the
one
problem
that
develop
with
respect
to
these
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
early
30's
and
why
federal
regulation
was
necessary
and
indeed
why
the
triple
a
in
part
was
pass
was
because
destructive
competition
had
in
sued
within
the
market.
this
was
competition
among
the
handlers
and
let
me
explain
this.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
a
handler
would
agree
to
pay
certain
prices.
a
handler
or
dairy
would
agree
to
pay
certain
prices
to
the
cooperatives.
the
cooperatives
at
that
time
were
also
using
a
system
not
at
all
dissimilar
in
fact
quite
similar
to
the
equalization
fluid
and
blend
price
enforced
today
under
the
secretary's
order.
and
under
that
equalization
and
blending
classified
price
system
in
nearby
farmers
received
a
higher
price
by
approximately
46
cents
per
hundredweight.
but
all
handlers
would
not
enter
into
these
agreements
with
the
cooperatives.
and
as
long
as
you
had
any
significant
number
of
handlers
who
would
not
do
so,
they
could
then
go
to
other
farmers
within
the
market
place
not
numbers
of
the
cooperative,
and
offer
them
a
price
not
equal
to
the
class
i
fluid
milk
price.
but
just
slightly
above
the
blend
price
that
the
cooperatives
were
paying
to
their
members
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
as
a
result
of
that,
they
could
charge
lower
prices
these
outside
handlers
not
members
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
could
charge
lower
prices
to
consumers
and
thereby
increase
their
consumer
markets.
as
a
result
the
coops
who
are
members
of
the
collective
or
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
then
had
to
reduce
their
price
which
means
they
had
to
put
pressure
on
their
producers
to
take
lower
prices
and
this
kept
going
on
and
on.
so
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
as
at
under
the
triple
a
of
33
and
the
35
act
expressly
to
follow
the
same
patterns
that
the
cooperatives
had
followed
and
they
stated
this
in
their
committee
reports.
but
to
bring
all
handlers
in
under
regulation
because
it
is
the
handlers
who
are
regulated
under
the
orders.
not
the
producers
as
such
directly.
a
producers
have
no
right
to
go
into
court
to
appeal
from
an
order
under
the
statute.
their
right
is
established
here
for
example
under
this
court's
holding
and
stark
against
wickard,
to
the
extent
they
can
complain
of
any
diminishment
in
what
they
should
rightfully
or
otherwise,
get
from
the
equalization
pool.
but
the
regulations
is
a
regulation
of
handlers
and
as
long
as
a
particular
farmer
or
groups
of
farmers
sell
to
a
handler
who
markets
some
milk
in
this
market
today
for
fluid
milk
purposes,
that
farmer
gets
the
advantage
of
the
blend
price.
now
in
fact,
the
requirement
here
is
really
quite
minimal
that
is
much
of
the
milk
that
many
farmers
sell
to
handlers
is
use
for
the
lower
price,
manufacturing
purposes;
cheese,
butter,
etcetera.
but
because
their
handler
may
shift
no
more
than
a
25%
of
his
milk
into
the
market
for
fluid
purposes
during
a
few
months
of
the
year,
and
i
believe
15%
during
three
other
months.
that
handler
qualifies
all
his
farmers
for
the
fluid
milk
price,
even
though,
most
or
all
or
large
part
of
their
milk
is
going
for
class
ii
are
manufactured
milk
purposes.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
what
the
interest
is
of
the
nearby
farmers
here
because
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
points
which
reflect
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
on
the
equities
here.
the
nearby
farmers
have
consistently
received
these
differentials
over
the
years
and
always
in
excess
of
transportation
and
handling
cost
savings.
overwhelmingly,
these
orders
have
been
approved
by
referendum
both
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
in
64,
the
boston
order
in
37,
and
the
secondary
market
orders.
each
time,
an
overwhelming
approval
by
farmers
and
farmers
must
vote
to
approve
this
order
by
a
vote
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
farmers
in
the
market.
if
that
vote
is
not
obtained,
there
is
no
regulation.
this
is
a
unique
partnership
between
the
secretary
and
the
farmers
and
perhaps
the
most
salient
point
here
is
that
the
nearby
farmers
who
have
voted
for
this
order
have
always
been
a
minority
of
the
farmers
in
the
market.
the
distant
farmers
have
i
think
consistently
over
the
years
numbered
well
over
50%,
indeed
over
the
two
third
that
is
necessary
to
approved
the
order
that
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
my
understanding
your
honor
is
that
the
system
the
secretary
employs
is
one-farmer-one-vote
by
referendum
and
approving
these
orders.
now,
in
fact
however
your
honor,
the
statute
also
authorizes
cooperatives
to
vote
for
their
members
and
so,
in
this
voting
from
time
to
time,
i
think
quite
consistently
in
fact,
the
cooperatives
due
vote
for
their
members.
the
largest
cooperative
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market,
i
believe
your
honor,
is
still
today
is
nempa
which
is
more
heavily
distant
producers
than
nearby
producers.
the
vote,
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
believe
so
your
honor.
it
would
always
depend
at
any
given
time
on
the
mix
of
nearby
and
distant
farmers.
i
think
quite
clearly
under
the
boston
order
if
it
would
have
carried
anyway
and
i
believe
today,
the
nearby
farmer's
number
no
more
than
one
third
of
those.
now,
it
may
vary
between
one
third
and
40%.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
believe,
well,
i
believe
it
can
do
at
either
way
your
honor.
i
believe
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
if
i
understand
your
question,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
cooperative
may
each
time
internally
ballot
or
request
to
votes
of
its
members
on
this.
i
believe
the
cooperatives
place
their
votes
based
on
what
the
board
of
directors
of
the
cooperative
decide.
i'm
not
sure
of
this
your
honor.
and
i
think,
this
may
indeed
vary
among
cooperatives.
so
obviously,
if
a
cooperative
voted
against
the
interest
of
its
majority,
it
would
be
a
simply
matter
for
the
majority
either
to
leave
that
cooperative
or
to
vote
out
the
board
of
directors.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
don't
know
how
the
internal
workings
of
the
cooperative
is,
no,
your
honor.
the
respondents
have
alleged
that
the
64
consolidation
order
that
change
drastically
the
economics
of
the
markets
place
and
so
far
as
the
nearby
differential
is
concern.
that
simply
isn't
so.
the
46-cent
and
23-cent
differentials
were
retained
in
the
identical
rate
that
they
were
under
the
constituent
orders.
what
did
happen
was
that
as
a
result
of
bringing
into
the
boston
order
which
was
the
by
far
largest
order
here
counting
for
over
75%
of
the
farmers
in
the
market
by
bringing
in
secondary
markets
which
had
high
fluid
use,
the
ultimate
result
for
those
distant
producers,
marketing
in
the
boston
order
just
before
consolidation
was
to
increase
the
amount
of
money
they
receive
in
the
12-month
period
after
consolidation.
three
cents
more
per
hundredweight
in
what
they
had
received
before.
one
other
quite
obvious
reason
that
the
nearby
farmers
are
interested
here
and
indeed,
they
sort
to
intervene
before
the
district
court.
that
intervention
was
denied.
it
was
pursued
on
appeal.
the
motion
for
summary
reversal
was
filed
and
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thereafter,
the
district
court
rendered
it
summary
judgment
below.
at
that
point,
the
nearby
farmers
sought
a
stay
of
the
summary
judgment
order
in
aid
of
their
appeal
on
intervention.
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay,
a
stay
which
already
been
denied
in
effect
to
the
government
by
the
district
court.
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay
but
gave
the
nearby
farmer
applicants
for
intervention,
the
choice
by
mooting
their
appeal
on
the
intervention
point
to
go
--
to
take
--
to
become
interveners
for
the
purpose
of
filing
an
appeal.
not
to
enter
into
the
district
court
proceeding
which
had
already
terminated.
in
effect,
that
was
a
hobson's
choice
since
for
the
nearby
farmers
not
to
have
elected
that
option
would
have
meant
that
the
escrow
fund
would
have
been
distributed
out
to
the
distant
farmers,
farmers
who
would
never
relied
on
it.
as
a
result,
the
nearby
farmers
chose
the
route,
which
enable
them.
one,
to
prosecute
an
appeal
at
that
time
the
government
have
not
noted
an
appeal
and
also
to
move
before
the
district
court
for
a
stay
since
the
court
of
appeals
had
denied
the
state
of
a
nearby
farmers.
the
nearby
farmers
obtained
that
stay
and
that
is
why
there
is
now
and
when
i
say
stay,
i
mean
preservation
of
the
status
quo
on
effect
where
the
escrow,
the
differential
continually
as
computed
and
then
added
to
the
fund.
there
is
now
an
escrow
somewhat
over
$8
million.
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
--
that
part
of
the
statute
involving
the
volume
of
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
applied.
we've
commented
at
length
in
our
brief
and
mr.
friedman
is
already
commented
to
you
on
the
uniform
price
irrespective
of
use
portion
of
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
volume
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
apply.
these
are
certainly
crucial
words
in
the
statute.
we
submit
that
these
are
price
variation
relating
to
marketing's
of
milk.
not
all
price
variations,
not
any
price
variations
that
might
come
into
existence
after
the
act
was
pass.
they
had
to
be
variations
that
were
customarily
paid
by
the
handlers.
usual
market
variations,
i
believe
that's
what
this
court
in
39
decision
in
rock
royal
referred
to
the
matters
and
they
had
to
be
not
sporadically
applied
by
handlers
before
the
act
was
pass
and
before
the
order,
i'm
sorry,
before
the
order
took
effect.
they
had
to
be
customarily
applied
by
handlers
before
that.
again,
congress
intended
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
of
free
market
competition
that
had
existed
before
1933
and
1935.
the
secretary
has
consistently
interpreted
volume
market
and
production
differential,
marketing
differential
customarily
applied
language
to
enable
him
to
provide
for
the
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market.
this
court
in
rock
royal
20
cents
of
a
25-cent
differential
was
born
by
the
pool
in
rock
royal.
its
not
an
individual
handler
pool,
i
believe
it
was
a
market
pool
but
in
the
pool
born
--
bore
that
20
cents
just
as
the
pool
bears
today,
the
46
cents,
and
this
court
upheld
the
differential
in
that
case.
it
was
not
identical
with
the
differential
involved
here.
it
provided
not
only
for
farm
location
but
said
also
that
farmers
must
deliver
to
plants
located
within
the
nearby
zone.
but
that
impractical
effect
is
always
what
nearby
farmers
have
done
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market.
they
did
so
years
ago
and
we're
advised
today
by
the
market
administrator
in
the
market
that
virtually
all
nearby
farmers
delivered
the
plants
within
the
market's
core
--
close
to
the
major
markets.
we
believe
one
of
the
major
reasons
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
astray
as
mr.
friedman
is
already
commented,
is
that
they
looked
to
--
they
made
erroneous
factual
assumptions.
they
thought
that
the
differential
pre
1937
was
not
one
paid
over
and
above
transportation
and
handling
cost
savings
was
not
one
paid
to
distant
farmers
who
delivered
to
a
nearby
zone.
that
is
factually
incorrect.
and
we
have
pointed
out
at
length
in
our
brief,
pages
51
and
52
that
that
isn't
correct.
your
honor,
if
the
court
pleases,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
for
me.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i'd
like
to
know
if
you
have
more
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
i
have
15
minutes?
then
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
complete
my
argument
if
the
court
pleases?
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
have
commented
on
the
committee
and
what
the
committee
report
means.
we've
set
forth
the
committee
report
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
and
the
particular
provisions
relevant
here
are
on
page
24(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
green
brief.
frankly,
the
committee
report
language
regarding
market
differential
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
among
other
things,
the
report
language
would
indicate
that
the
differentials
they
were
talking
about
were
usually
paid
in
secondary
markets.
and
i
believe
the
court
in
blair
said
that
market
differential
there
depended
upon
the
nature
of
the
market.
nature
of
the
market
i
believe,
they
thought
of
a
secondary
markets.
but
in
fact,
not
only
the
nearby
differentials
but
the
country
station
differentials
which
respondent
say
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
says,
where
market
differentials
are
those
paid
in
primary
markets
and
traditionally,
they've
been
paid
in
primary
markets.
while
the
lower
court
did
not
get
into
the
question
of
substantial
evidence,
they
certainly
looked
to
certain
excerpts
from
the
evidence
in
analyzing
the
interpretation
and
construction
of
the
statute.
for
that
reason
and
because
we
believe
that
if
this
court
reverses
finding
that
the
secretary
had
the
authority
to
put
a
nearby
farm
location
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
market,
then
it
can
at
that
point
dispose
of
this
case
rather
than
remanding
it.
i
should
like
to
comment
and
make
it
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
if
you
believe
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor
that
the
secretary
had
the
authority
and
has
the
authority
today
under
the
market
differential
customarily
applied
language
to
put
a
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
that
is
the
46-cent
and
23-cent
differentials
that
we're
talking
about
here.
this
court
if
you
in
other
words
affirm
the
secretary's
power
reversing
the
lower
court.
there
are
then
possible
questions
of
substantial
evidence
which
has
--
have
been
raised
in
the
initial
complaint
of
respondents
that
have
not
been
passed
upon
by
the
lower
court
here
and
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
district
court.
we
believe
that
even
though
this
is
a
truncated
record
and
it
is
a
truncated
record,
it
contains
only
illustrative
excepts
from
the
administrative
proceedings
in
64
and
in
years
passed
that
there
are
still
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
secretary's
determination
that
a
nearby
differential
in
the
mass,
rhode
island,
marketing
order
was
necessary
and
would
support
market's
stability.
and
in
effect,
this
is
what
he
found
in
proposing
for
referendum
vote
by
the
farmers
and
what
he
had
to
find
them
to
the
statute
that
the
order
with
the
differential
would
promote
market
stability.
commenting
of
the
evidence,
this
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
to
make
a
finding
that
the
order
is
a
whole
would
promotes
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
think,
he
need
only
find
that
the
order
as
a
whole.
this
is
an
integral
--
interweave
of
provisions.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
what
is
being
challenge
here
is
simply
the
nearby
differential
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
no.
i
think
just
the
nearby
different
--
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
they
could
strike
the
nearby
differential
provision.
but
that
the
order
would
still
remain
viable.
we
took
the
contrary
position
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
they
left
the
rest
of
the
order
standing.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
--
what
they
did
is
simply
going
the
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
we
believe
in
short
your
honor
that
they
should
not
have
done
that,
that
it
was
improper
for
them.
but
in
terms,
they
never
commented
upon
the
substantial
evidence
points.
they
commented
only
and
held
only
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
secretary
had
authority
to
put
the
nearby
differential
in
the
order.
they
never
reach
the
question
of
substantial
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
yes,
because
it's
a
separability
clause
in
the
order
and
they
promise
that
their
elimination
of
the
differential
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well,
the
only
evidence
they
have
before
them
was
evidence
regarding
the
differential,
not
evidence.
there
was
not
administrative
record
before
the
court
regarding
the
entire
order.
they
only
had
select
--
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
well
we
believe
your
honor
that
even
this
excerpts
which
have
been
supplied
and
given
the
consistent
administrative
into
the
both
on
a
basis
of
these
excerpts
and
on
the
basis
of
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
by
the
secretary
over
30
years.
mr.
lawrence
d.
hollman
on
substantial
evidence?
no
your
honor.
the
district
court
judgment
was
limited
to
its
holding
that
on
the
basis
of
blair,
an
injunction
will
be
granted.
i
started
to
say
that
these
marketing
orders
are
not
something
that
once
promulgated
or
left
alone.
they're
delicate
and
very
intricate
complex
of
interrelated
economic
and
marketing
factors.
experts
pay
close
attention
to
them
both
the
secretary
and
experts
within
his
department
and
the
farmers
themselves.
there
are
constant
amendments,
suspensions,
decisions
or
orders
affecting
each
marketing
order.
the
boston
order
and
the
mass,
rhode
island
order
since
1936,
just
two
orders
had
been
the
subject
of
suspensions,
amendments,
decisions
or
orders
208
times
according
to
the
records
to
the
department
of
agriculture.
there
been
some
47
amendments
to
these
orders
over
the
year.
the
farmers
and
the
secretary
together
have
cautiously
and
zealously
observed
the
workings
of
the
order
and
modified
it.
the
provisions
of
it
are
an
instreakably
intermingled.
its
with
that
thought
in
mind
that
we
maintain
that
even
if
the
--
this
court
were
to
believe
that
there
were
questions
regarding
the
statutory
authority
that
it
would
not
be
possible
simply
to
excise
one
provision
from
the
order
and
leave
the
order
standing.
an
expert
from
the
department
of
agriculture,
one
of
the
leading
experts
in
the
dairy
industry,
mr.
herbert
forest
in
an
affidavits
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
which
is
in
our
appendix
in
the
record
here
stated
that
in
his
belief,
the
elimination
of
differential
would
cause
disruption
and
instability
in
the
market
place.
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
order
is
to
promote
market
stability.
and
if
taking
out
this
provision
will
promote
market
instability,
then
this
matter,
if
there
are
questions
regarding
the
secretary's
authority
must
be
remanded
to
enable
him,
we
believe
and
submit
to
determine
what
will
make
the
order
stable.
he
has
other
powers
which
may
accomplish
some
of
the
inherent
economic
values
at
the
nearby
differential,
that
he
can
employ
in
this
regard.
but
we
also
believe
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
addison
against
holly
hills
on
the
basis
of
that
case,
if
there
is
any
question
regarding
his
authority,
a
remand
is
an
order
and
under
this
court's
statement
in
lehigh,
we
believe
that
the
secretary
should
then
be
given
an
opportunity
to
resort
pro
tanto
to
the
escrow
fund,
which
we
believe
in
any
of
the
event
should
be
the
property
of
the
nearby
producers
who
have
relied
on
the
differential
for
so
many
years.
who
have
made
investment
decisions
and
marketing
decisions
on
the
basis
of
the
differential.
i
would
like
now
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may?
