mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
in
these
consolidated
cases
which
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
one
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
authority
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
to
include
in
note
marketing
orders
a
provision
for
the
payment
of
a
premium
to
farmers
who
are
located
close
to
the
center
of
the
milk
market.
more
specifically,
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
so-called
“farm
differential
payments
in
the
boston
rhode
island
milk
order.
under
which
farmers
whose
farms
are
located
within
40
miles
of
the
center
of
the
market
are
paid
a
differential
over
and
above
it
the
blended
price
of
all
farmers
receive
are
46
cents
per
100
pounds
of
milk
which
is
the
equivalent
of
one
cent
a
quart.
there's
also
a
provision
in
the
order
which
provide
for
payment
of
23
cents
a
100
pounds
for
farmers
who
are
located
in
the
next
area
40
to
in
effect,
40
to
80
miles
from
the
center
of
the
mark.
but
that
involves
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
differentials
involved
in
under
the
order
and
i
therefore
sure
limit
my
discussion
because
its
considerations
of
equally
applicable
to
the
46
cent
differential.
the
present
case
brought
as
a
class
action
is
by
farmers
in
vermont
who
are
located
beyond
the
area
covered
by
these
differentials
and
therefore
under
the
order
and
not
eligible
for
them.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
with
the
statute
does
not
authorized
these
particular
differentials
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
and
payment
of
the
differential.
in
so
ruling
of
the
court
appeals
relied
squarely
on
an
earlier
case
which
i
shall
discuss
called
blair
against
freeman
which
it
struck
down
a
similar
differential
in
a
new
york-new
jersey
milk
marketing
order
and
i'd
also
say
that
the
outset
that
these
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
include
this
differentials
contrary
to
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
1939,
30
years
ago
which
specifically
held
these
particular
differentials.
now,
to
put
these
statutory
issues
in
the
appropriate
frame
of
reference,
first,
i
just
very
briefly
like
it,
refresh
the
court
on
what
i'm
sure
is
already
familiar
to
it.
the
peculiarities
of
the
way
in
which
milk
is
sold
in
the
problems
that
require
this
kind
of
legislation,
and
then
i'd
like
to
sketch
the
legislative
history
of
full
statutes
involved
and
finally
to
describe
the
administrative
background
of
this
order
and
its
predecessors.
we
start
with
the
fact
of
course,
that
milk
basically
has
two
uses.
the
use
of
milk
as
fluid
milk
for
drinking
purposes
which
is
known
as
class
i
use
and
then
the
use
of
other
milk
for
manufactured
purposes,
butter,
cheese,
ice
cream
which
is
known
as
class
ii
purposes.
the
demand
for
so-called
fluid
milk,
milk
for
drinking
is
relatively
static
throughout
the
whole
year.
but
unfortunately
for
the
milk
industry,
the
production
of
the
cows
is
not
static.
the
cows
produce
more
milk
in
the
spring
and
the
summer
than
they
do
in
the
fall
and
the
winter.
so,
this
means
in
order
to
meet
the
uniform
demand
for
class
milk,
one
milk
throughout
the
year,
it
is
necessary
to
add
sufficient
cows
to
produce
that
amount
during
the
winter
months.
when
they're
not
producing
as
much
and
accordingly,
the
result
is
in
the
spring
and
summer
months,
there
is
a
surplus
of
milk
production.
milk
of
course
is
a
highly
perishable
commodity
and
the
result
is
that
milk
that
is
produced
of
the
great
distance
from
the
market
cannot
compete
with
locally
produced
milk
for
the
class
i
use.
although
of
course,
it
can
compete
the
class
ii
use.
that
is
in
the
boston
market,
fresh
milk
from
wisconsin
cannot
compete
with
massachusetts'
milk,
but
obviously
manufactured
cheese
from
wisconsin
easily
competes
with
manufactured
cheese
from
the
massachusetts
area.
now
traditionally,
milk
is
which
is
used
for
class
i
purposes
has
commanded
a
substantially
higher
price
in
the
market
than
milk
that
is
used
for
class
ii
purposes.
now,
the
result
of
this
combination
of
fact,
this
has
been
that
without
any
regulation
drastic
and
devastating
cut
throat
competition
developed
among
the
farmers
to
try
to
get
their
milk
sold
for
the
class
i
use
which
would
yield
them
a
higher
amount.
the
dairies
for
example
would
play
different
farmers
off
against
each
other
driving
the
prices
down.
and
as
a
result
by
the
time
of
the
depression
in
the
earlier
1930's,
the
milk
prices
had
been
drastically
reduced
and
in
some
instance,
farmers
--
where
farmers
were
forced
to
sell
milk
at
less
than
their
cost.
now,
in
order
to
stabilize
this
completely
disorganized
milk
market,
two
purposes
were
achieved.
first,
it
was
important
to
raise
the
price
of
milk
and
secondly,
it
was
important
to
avoid
the
destructive
competition
among
farmers
to
try
to
get
access
to
this
class
i
market.
and
the
secretary
in
the
boston
area
has
followed
the
same
practice
that
he
has
followed
in
most
other
areas.
he
employs
a
system
of
so-called
market
pooling.
under
which,
the
amount
each
farmer
receives
for
his
milk
doe
not
depend
upon
the
particular
use
that
that
farmer's
milk
is
put.
he
gets
the
same
price
whether
or
not
his
milk
is
use
all
for
class
i
purposes,
all
for
class
ii
purposes,
or
in
some
blend.
the
way
this
is
done
is
by
the
use
of
a
so-called
blended
price.
under
which,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
sets
minimum
prices
for
class
i
and
class
ii
milk,
then
determines
how
or
for
what
purposes
the
milk.
all
the
milk
sold
in
the
market
has
been
used
and
on
this
basis
calculates
the
total
value
of
the
milk.
then
in
effect
device
this
by
the
total
volume
and
ends
up
with
a
blended
price
with
each
farmer's
to
receive
and
by
definition
of
this
price,
of
course,
is
less
than
the
class
i
price
and
there
something
more
than
the
class
ii
price.
now,
the
particular
milk
dealers,
the
dairies,
the
manufactures
who
are
in
the
statute
to
call
handlers,
what
happens
to
them
is
if
a
particular
dealer
sells
of
more
milk
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i'll
just
add
some
if
they're
in
explained,
just
take
me
one
minute.
if
the
particular
deal
or
sales
more
of
his
milk
for
class
i
use
which
means
he
would
under
this
calculation
receive
more
than
he
has
to
pay
his
dairies,
he
in
effect
pays
the
excess
into
this
producer's
settlement
fund.
conversely,
if
more
of
the
milk
is
use
to
class
ii
purposes
so
that
he
would
not
get
enough
on
this
calculation
to
pay
his
farmers
what
they're
entitled
to,
he
draws
on
this
producer
settlement
fund,
and
the
result
is
everyone
gets
the
same
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
one
thing
very
clear
that
in
determining
the
blended
price
pay
to
all
farmers
under
the
statute,
these
differentials
are
deducted
before
this
is
calculated
that
is
out
of
the
pool
which
is
divided
among
the
all
farmers.
there
is
first
pay
out
of
various
of
statutory
differentials.
and
that
of
course
is
why
we
have
this
case
because
the
effect
of
taking
out
the
46
cent
nearby
farm
differential
in
the
boston
milk
market
is
to
reduce
by
12
cents,
the
blended
price
that
is
paid
to
all
the
farmers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
they
come
off
the
top
and
then
what
is
left
is
divided
up
and
the
theme
of
my
argument
will
be
that
that
precisely
would
congress
intended
the
scheme
to
be.
now,
these
farm
location
differentials
had
their
origins
a
long
time
ago.
in
the
marketing
practices
at
the
1920's,
the
mid
1920's,
long
before,
there
was
any
federal
regulation.
but
that
period
under
contracts
that
the
various
of
the
dairies
had
with
cooperatives.
farmers,
whose
farms
were
located
close
to
the
boston
area,
received
the
greater
amount
with
their
milk
than
farmers
whose
farms
were
located
distance
away.
and
when
i
say
a
greater
amount
and
i
will
keep
referring
to
the
greater
amount,
i
want
to
stress
one
thing
because
this
is
--
there's
a
challenge
by
our
opponents.
this
was
an
amount
that
exceeded
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
transportation
between
bringing
milk
in
from
the
distance
and
from
nearby.
the
indications
are
that
these
men
received
roughly
a
dollar
more
for
100
pounds
which
again
in
a
very
rough
estimate
was
very
close
to
the
46
cents
that
they
now
receive
under
the
boston
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
were
numbered.
they
are
numbered
mr.
justice.
one
of
them
was
the
fact
of
course
that
the
farmers
located
close
to
the
market
would
traditionally
able
to
sell
more
of
their
milk
at
the
class
i
use
which
produced
the
higher
price.
in
addition
to
that,
the
farmers
who
are
close
in
over
the
years
had
been
able
to
make
their
milk
production
more
even
which
was
of
advantage
to
the
handlers
to
the
dairies
and
then
in
the
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
its
not
that
its
not
so
much
of
the
geographical
locate,
just
developed
over
the
years
that
they
found
that
in
order
to
do
business
with
the
handlers
who
is
selling
the
most
of
the
milk
for
class
i
uses,
it
was
important
to
continue
--
for
their
relationship
that
they
have
an
even
production.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
well
this
entails
them
apparently
in
very
involved
farming
practices
through
the
use
of
artificial
insemination.
they
are
able
at
some
cost
to
spread
the
milk
production
over.
the
expression
they
use
is
the
cows
of
freshened,
and
apparently,
the
cows
of
freshened
some
of
them
in
a
way
that
they
produced
their
milk
in
the
fall
and
in
the
winter
rather
than
in
the
spring
and
summer,
and
that
is
the
technique
they
use.
now,
there's
another
advantage
of
course
to
the
producers
of
having
this
relationship
with
the
nearby
farmers
which
is
that
these
men
were
available
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
that
is
if
sudden
those
days
if
late
in
the
day,
they
suddenly
discovered
they
needed
more
milk,
they
could
just
send
a
truck
out
and
get
this
milk
more
easily,
then
if
they
have
to
go
a
great
distance
away
when
we
didn't
have
modern
methods
of
refrigeration,
and
also
of
course
in
bad
weather.
if
you
had
a
very
bad
snow
storm
in
the
area,
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
the
source
of
supply.
now,
when
congress
passed
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
in
1933,
very
early
in
the
administration
of
this
act,
the
secretary
issued
a
so-called
license
to
the
boston
border.
this
was
the
predecessor
to
the
present
order
type
of
arrangement.
and
under
this
license,
the
license
continued
the
previous
advantage
that
the
nearby
farmers
had
enjoyed.
that
is
the
nearby
farmers
got
more
for
their
milk
than
the
distant
farmers.
to
be
sure,
it
was
not
in
the
present
form
of
the
differential.
it
was
not
paying
them
a
certain
amount
over
and
above
the
regular
price.
it
was,
however,
reflected
a
high
up
price
paid
for
milk
from
the
nearby
farm
is
then
was
paid
for
the
distant
farm
farmers.
two
years
later
from
reasons
unrelated
to
the
differentially,
boston
license
was
invalidated
by
a
district
court
decision.
partly
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
schechter
case,
congress
in
1935
amended
the
agriculture
adjustment
act.
the
amendment
added
the
identical
language
it
is
now
in
section
8c
(5)
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
couple
of
minutes
dealing
with
milk
marketing
orders.
and
in
making
these
amendments,
the
committee
report
stated
that
the
provisions
dealing
with
milk
marketing
and
distribution
and
i
quote,
“follow
the
methods
employed
by
cooperative
associations
of
producers
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act.”
now
shortly
thereafter,
a
new
order
was
issued
for
boston
in
1936.
this
order
for
the
first
time
specifically
provided
for
higher
prices
to
any
farmer
whose
farm
is
located
within
40
miles
of
the
state
house
of
boston.
again,
it
provided
of
them
not
for
the
mechanism
of
differential
a
premium
to
this
nearby
for
farmers
of
approximately
46
cents.
this
was
done
by
providing
that
these
nearby
farmers
want
to
receive
the
class
i
price
rather
than
the
somewhat
low
of
branded
--
blended
price.
this
order
remain
in
effect
for
only
six
months
when
another
district
court
in
massachusetts
upheld
the
amended
statute
unconstitutional.
the
secretary
then
suspended
the
order
and
the
order
remained
suspended
until
congress
had
passed
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937.
that
act
utilized
and
bought
in
the
identical
language
dealing
with
milk
marketing
orders
that
had
been
under
the
1935
amendments
to
the
triple
act.
but
in
addition
to
this,
there
was
a
specific
provision
in
the
1937
act
section
4
that
stated,
that
it
expressly
ratified,
legalized
and
confirmed
all
existing
licenses
market
orders
and
provisions
that
had
been
issued
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
and
its
amendments.
the
secretary
reinstated
the
farm
location
differential
in
the
boston
milk
marketing
order
in
1937
and
this
time,
for
the
first
instance,
explicitly
provided
for
the
46-cent
and
then
the
23-cent
differential
depending
upon
the
distance
from
boston.
and
since
that
time,
since
1937,
every
milk
marketing
order,
the
secretary
has
issued
for
this
new
england
area
has
included
similar
differentials
both
the
amount
of
46
cents
and
the
40
miles
within
the
center
of
the
market.
this
included
1949
marketing
orders
for
springfield
and
wister,
1958
when
he
passed/adopted
an
order
for
southeast
to
new
england
consisting
of
rhode
island
and
southern
massachusetts.
and
finally,
in
1964
when
after
extensive
hearings,
the
secretary
consolidated
before
previous
orders
for
this
area
into
the
present
order.
and
i
would
just
like
to
quote
three
sentences
which
we
set
forth
at
our
brief
on
pages
16
to
18
in
which
the
secretary
explained
why
in
1964,
he
was
reject
in
both
proposals
to
eliminate
the
differential
and
proposals
on
the
other
side
of
the
differential
should
be
increased.
he
said
as
follows.
such
farm
location
differentials
have
been
in
effect
under
the
several
new
england
orders
since
the
inception
of
the
orders.
the
differentials
were
adopted
to
reflect
in
the
pricing
structure
of
the
orders,
historical
price
relationships
by
location
which
prevailed
in
these
markets.
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
page
14
to
15
of
our
brief.
it's
also
contained
in
the
record
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
found
that
customarily
somewhat
higher
values,
above
those
which
normally
reflect
the
transportation
costs,
attached
to
milk
produced
near
the
principle
consumption
centers
as
compare
to
the
market
value
of
milk
produced
in
a
more
distant
areas
of
the
milk
shade.
so,
if
i
may
just
very
briefly
recapitulate
what
i
think
we
have
before
us
is
the
following.
first,
since
before
the
time
of
federal
regulation,
farmers
located
close
to
the
boston
and
new
england
milk
marketing
areas
have
always
received
more
for
their
milk
over
above
the
transportation
differential
than
farmers
located
further
away.
secondly,
that
when
congress
in
1937
passed
the
agricultural
marketing
adjustment
agreement
act,
it
ratified
confirmed
and
legalized
all
previous
licenses,
orders
and
provisions
which
of
course,
included
the
nearby
differential
provisions
of
the
boston
orders.
just
in
passing,
the
court
of
appeals
discounted
this
and
said,
it
believed
that
all
of
that
provision
was
intended
to
do
is
to
avoid
a
lapse
under
the
statute,
and
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
while
we
think
that
while
that
was
one
of
the
purposes,
the
legislative
history
also
indicates
that
was
further
intended
to
approve
and
confirmed
and
ratify
everything
that
had
been
done
before.
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
statutory
provisions
involve
in
the
case
which
we
think
determine
the
in
control
or
legality
of
the
farm
location
differentials.
they're
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
pages
2
to
4
of
our
brief
and
it
begins
the
statutes
speaks
of
milk
and
its
products
terms
and
conditions
or
orders
it
says
in
the
case
of
milk
and
its
products.
orders
pursuant
to
this
section
shall
contain
one
or
more
of
the
following
terms
and
conditions
and
accept
this
provide
else
when
no
others.
and
then
over
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
it
should
to
provide
--
milk
orders
may
provide
for
the
payment
to
all
producers
and
associations
of
producers,
delivering
milk
to
all
handlers
of
uniform
prices
for
all
milk
so
delivered,
irrespective
of
the
uses
made
of
such
milk
by
the
individual
handler
to
whom
it
is
delivered.
and
then
it
goes
on
it
says,
subject
only
to
adjustments
for
volume,
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
applied
by
the
handlers
subject
to
such
order.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
these
orders
were
beyond
the
secretary's
authority
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
apparently
believe
that
the
irrespective
of
the
use
provision
by
any
consideration
of
the
fact
that
historically
farmers
were
receiving
a
higher
amount
for
their
milk
because
a
larger
portion
of
that
was
available
in
use
for
class
i
purposes.
and
secondly,
the
court
said,
this
in
any
event
was
not
a
market
differential
as
that
term
is
use
in
the
statute.
now,
i
first
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
irrespective
of
uses
clause
which
the
court
in
this
case
relied
squarely
on
the
prior
holding
in
blair.
and
after
saying
that
it
accepted
the
whole
naturally
the
holding
in
blair
that
you,
secretary
was
barred
from
taking
any
account
of
the
prior
use
of
the
milk,
and
then
went
on
and
examine
what
the
secretary
had
said
in
this,
this
case
in
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
statements
over
the
time
that
he
promulgated
all
the
orders.
that
in
fact,
he
had
relied
on
this
impermissible
factor.
now,
we
think
that
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
court
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
secretary
did
not
mr.
justice
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
we
study
the
case,
we
felt
there
were
various
factors
in
it
that
would
not
make
in
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
reveiw
by
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
yes
mr.
justice.
for
one
thing
in
the
blair
case,
the
secretary
had
relied
solely
on
the
fact
of
the
use
of
the
milk.
that
is
the
higher
percentage
class
used,
class
i
use.
whereas
in
this
case,
we
think
he
has
indicated
that
the
other
factors.
secondly
in
the
blair
case,
the
secretary
relied
solely
on
the
claim
not
that
this
was
a
market
differential,
but
this
was
another
of
the
statutory
differentials
relating
to
the
place
at
which
the
milk
was
delivered.
that
was
the
sole
basis
of
this
opinion
at
the
blair
case.
and
for
those
reasons
quite
frankly,
we
did
not
feel
that
case
would
be
inappropriate
one
to
take
to
this
court
for
presenting
the
broad
question
of
the
secretary's
authority
to
include
these
provisions.
now,
this
cost
it
seems
to
us
the
irrespective
abuse
clause
it
seems
to
us,
has
nothing
to
do
with
differentials
at
all.
rather,
it's
purpose
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
secretary
may
pay
a
uniform
price
to
all
farmers
even
though
a
particular
farmer's
milk
was
sold
for
the
higher
class
i
use
than
someone
else's
milk.
indeed,
it
was
that
factor
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
unsuccessful
attack
in
this
court
in
the
rock
royal
cooperative
case
in
307
u.s.
upon
the
whole
marketing
equalization
program
that
contention
there
was
that
it
denied
the
farmer
of
his
milk
was
being
use
for
class
i
purposes.
it
took
us
property
without
due
process
of
law
and
it
was
discriminatory
that
he
didn't
get
the
full
value
of
his
milk,
that
he
got
only
the
blended
price.
and
we
think
in
stark
against
wickard,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
that.
now
of
course
under
this
arrangement,
all
of
the
farmers,
all
of
the
nearby
farmers
get
the
identical
price
for
their
milk
without
regard
to
the
use
made
of
their
milk
by
the
particular
handlers.
statute
speaks
and
the
use
is
made
of
that
such
milk
by
the
individual
handler
to
whom
it
is
delivered.
every
single
one
of
the
farmers
located
within
this
nearby
area
gets
the
blended
price,
plus
the
differential.
he
gets
it
whether
his
handler
sells
all
of
his
milk
for
class
i
use,
all
of
his
milk
for
class
ii
use
or
some
blend.
and
we
fail
for
a
think
that
the
validity
of
these
differentials
does
not
at
all
depend
upon
the
irrespective
of
use
clause
that
the
way
of
determine
the
validity
of
these
differentials
is
looking
to
the
next
clause
which
deals
with
the
adjustments
and
differentials.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
the
critical
question
in
the
case
is
whether
this
market
different
leaves,
differentials
are
market
differentials
customarily
applied
by
the
handlers.
the
act
of
course
does
not
define
market
differentials,
and
we
think
what
this
phrase
means
is
a
differential
that
customarily
has
been
applied
by
the
handlers
in
the
market.
now
in
the
light
of
the
history
i
have
given,
the
statutory
history
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
the
a
and
it
would
be
forget
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
market
differentials
over
to
the
top
customarily
applied
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
handlers
subject
to
set
forth.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
history
i
have
given,
the
previous
experience
before
federal
regulation,
the
history
shown
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
procedures
formerly
applied
by
the
cooperatives,
the
confirmation
and
ratification
of
1937
that
this
definition
cannot
be
given
the
very
narrow
reading
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
them.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
all
it
is
covered
by
the
phrase
market
differential
is
payments
which
a
farmer
receives
extra
payments
for
delivering
his
milk
to
the
country
--
city
plant
rather
than
to
the
country
plant.
that
is,
it's
a
differential
for
delivering
they
say
in
the
city
market
rather
than
the
country
market.
that
interpretation
rest
on
a
statement
in
the
committee
reports
which
so
describes
the
market
differential.
we
think
in
the
light
of
all
this
history
that
this
decrypting
was
merely
intended
to
be
illustrative
of
the
type
of
market
differential
and
it
was
not
intended
to
define
the
outer
limits
of
the
differential.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
it's
somewhat
complicated
the
reasons
why
if
this
language
was
construed
as
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it,
it
would
not
be
particularly
meaningful.
there
be
other
phrase
of
the
statute
that
will
embrace
the
type
of
differential
at
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
the
market
differential.
now
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
in
1939,
the
first
circuit
upheld
the
validity
of
the
market
differentials
in
the
1937
boston
milk
marketing
order
and
express
--
explicitly
held
that
they
were
market
differentials.
and
in
addition
to
that
as
we
develop
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
rock
royal
case,
although,
it
dealt
not
with
differentials
paid
on
a
market
wise
basis
but
by
individual
handlers,
nevertheless
since
the
operative
language
of
the
two
sets
in
the
statute
is
the
same
as
equally
applicable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
just
suggested
that
this
was
one
of
the
types
things.
i
don't
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
the
committee
was
saying
that
is
all
a
market
differential
means.
i
think,
in
the
light
of
the
history
in
the
broad
language
market
differential,
it
was
intended
to
give
the
secretary
the
authority
to
continue
this
payment.
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
whole
history
of
this
statute
shows
that,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
stabilize
milk
markets
to
eliminate
the
cut
throat
competition
within
the
existing
pricing
structure.
it
is
not
intended
to
radically
alter
the
relationships
that
it
existed
from
many
years
among
the
different
groups
of
producers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
that
mr.
justice,
it
was
the
fact
that
payments
would
tied
to
the
end
use
that
led
to
this
drastic
and
devastating
competition
among
the
farmers
driving
down
the
price.
and
that's
what
they
were
attempting
to
do,
it
seems
to
us,
was
to
eliminate
as
a
fact
that
leading
to
the
depressing
of
milk
prices.
farmers
fighting
each
other
to
see
which
one
could
have
the
greatest
share
of
the
class
i
market
and
preventing
the
handlers
from
using
this
is
to
leaver
to
fight
them.
but
once
that
was
accomplished,
once
that
type
of
the
limp
competition
was
eliminated,
it
seems
that
what
cut
to
us
that
would
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
say
that
that
was
as
far
as
you
could
go.
you
could
eliminate
this
type
of
pricing
competition
that
was
not
to
be
the
radical
realignment,
the
radical
changing
of
the
structure
of
the
milk
marketing
that
is
results
from
this
decision
below.
now,
the
respondents
repeatedly
tell
us
that
this
is
a
very
unfair
thing
that
the
effect
of
this
differential
is
basically
requiring
the
farmers
in
the
distant
markets
to
subsidies
a
nearby
farms.
and
they
say,
if
in
fact
this
nearby
milk
has
some
value
to
do
the
handlers,
let
the
handlers
pay
for
it.
don't
make
us
pay
for
it.
this
again
it
seems
to
us
rests
on
the
mistaken
notion
that
under
the
act,
all
farmers
have
to
be
treated
equally.
we
think
under
the
act,
what
it
is
that
all
farmers
are
to
be
treated
equitably.
that
is
they
are
to
receive
the
same
prices
subject
to
the
various
differentials
provided.
and
if
as
we
believe
the
market
differentials
that
here
are
permissible
that
farm
location
differentials
are
valid
as
market
differentials,
it
seems
it's
quite
immaterial
with
the
effect
of
paying
this
differential
as
to
reduce
the
blended
price.
that's
precisely
we
think,
but
the
statute
contemplates.
and
if
the
handlers
would
give
them
discretion
to
decide
to
whom
to
make
payments
for
the
additional
values,
how
much
under
what
circumstances
fee
--
its
very
clear.
this
will
be
exactly
this
sort
of
thing
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent;
the
same
kind
of
cut
throat
competition
that
you
have
back
in
the
early
days.
and
finally,
the
arc
man
it
seems
to
us
rests
on
a
mistaken,
at
least,
a
dubious
factual
assumption,
the
assumption
that
somehow,
if
you'll
eliminated
the
nearby
differential
and
increase
the
blended
price,
the
distant
farmers
would
be
much
better
off.
well
of
course
they'll
be
much
better
off
immediately.
they
get
12
cents
more
a
100-pound,
but
it
doesn't
follow
at
all.
but
in
the
long
run,
they'll
be
any
better
off
because
once
you
increase
the
blended
price
in
the
boston
market,
the
result
is
likely
to
be
that
handlers
operating
in
other
areas
will
begin
to
bring
their
milk
into
the
boston
market.
this
will
create
a
surplus.
this
in
turn
will
result
in
depressing
the
price
in
the
boston
market
and
the
end
result
for
all
that
appears
is
that
the
prices
maybe
driven
down,
indeed
even
below
the
present
level.
and
then
there's
another
problem
is
which
is
that
everyone
knows
farms
is
having
a
hard
time
today
that
the
nearby
farmers
for
more
than
30
years
have
acted
on
the
assumption
that
would
receive
this
differentials.
that
these
differentials
have
suddenly
terminated.
there's
a
reason
to
believe
that
a
large
number
of
nearby
farmers
in
the
boston
area
have
may
decide
either
that
they
can
use
their
land
more
profitably
for
something
other
than
farming
and
they
sell
out
to
the
real
estate,
subdivided
it,
etcetera.
so,
the
end
result
again
is
likely
that
it
be
a
serious
shortage
of
milk
for
the
nearby
area
and
once
again,
leading
to
great
instability
in
the
market.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
fourth
brief
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
in
each
of
them
really
arises
in
response
to
a
question
of
number
from
--
of
the
court.
first,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
the
question
of
the
origin
of
this
phrase
“nearby
differentials”.
i
think
that's
colloquial
phrase
but
what
the
secretary,
the
word
secretary
used
in
this
order
in
1964,
he
spoke
of
it
as
farm
location
differentials.
farm
location
differential
which
i
think
is
a
more
accurate
representation.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
whether
anybody
would
loose
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
they
were
presented
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgments
and
it
is
referred
to
at
page
84
of
the
record,
affidavits
by
some
of
the
nearby
farmers
which
indicated
that
if
this
differential
is
abandoned,
if
this
differential
is
struck
out,
they
will
in
fact
not
be
getting
back
the
total
expenses
as
result
of
the
blended
price
they
received.
and
then
i'd
like
to
refer
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
finding
on
that,
no
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
two
questions
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
the
first
you
inquired
mr.
justice
as
to
how
the
cooperatives
vote?
they
do
vote
as
a
unit.
that
is
if
there
is
a
division
all
the
votes
are
cast
in
one
way.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
very
clear
that
if
that
this
vote
must
represent
from
votes
of
the
majority
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
of
course,
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
when
this
1964
order
was
put
to
a
vote,
it
was
approve
by
something
like
89%
of
all
the
farmers
in
the
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
take
it
or
leave
it
and
then
many
situations
--
this
is
true
of
many
situations,
you
face
when
you've
deciding
whether
to
do
something
with
the
pros
and
the
cons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
finally,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
a
minute
about
this
point
that
they
are
only
two
other
orders
in
the
whole
united
states
that
have
this
provision.
originally,
a
few
years
ago,
there
were
four
orders.
the
new
york-new
jersey
order
that
was
struck
down,
an
order
in
chicago
which
was
subsequently
vacated
because
of
the
unwillingness
of
the
handlers
to
accept
certain
changes.
the
present
order
which
been
struck
down
and
the
connecticut
order
which
of
course
is
now
under
litigation
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
cranston
case.
while,
these
are
only
four
out
of
70
orders,
they
it
covered
roughly
40%
of
all
the
milk
production
in
the
united
states.
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
something
which
i
think
it's
quite
significant.
there's
testimony
in
this
record
at
page
549
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
it.
as
to
the
extent
of
the
hold's
problem
of
how
these
differentials
come
into
being,
what
that
causes
is
549
statements
--
statement
that
in
the
state
of
california
and
the
state
of
california
is
a
state,
one
of
the
states
that
has
no
federal
regulation
at
all.
this
is
statement
of
state
of
california,
produces
located
nearby
los
angeles
distributing
plants
are
able
to
obtain
more
favorable
contracts
and
thus,
a
higher
class
i
utilization
then
produces
that
are
located
in
the
central
valley
or
any
other
place.
in
order
words,
even
without
a
milk
marketing
order
at
the
present
time,
handlers
are
willing
to
pay
more
to
farmers
who
located
near
the
or
--
near
the
center
of
the
market
than
to
distant
farmers.
no
coercion,
no
claimant,
the
distant
farmers
are
required
to
accept
to
the
--
quite
accept
this.
this
is
the
operation,
the
normal
operation
of
the
market
and
i
think
the
reason
why
we
don't
have
anymore
of
these
provisions
in
milk
marketing
orders
is
just
the
way
markets
have
a
reason.
some
of
the
areas
of
the
country,
smaller
areas
what
has
happen
is
you
haven't
had
the
problem.
the
farmers
had
been
closer
in.
you
haven't
hired
this
kind
of
competition
for
the
class
i
market
characterized
these
eastern
markets.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if,
if
depending
on
what
the
circumstances,
if
that
he
have
--
if
an
appear
that
prior
to
the
time
of
the
marketing
order,
they
had
this
existing
--
i
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
if
for
example
the
secretary
found,
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
--
yes,
it
would
have
to
exist
mr.
justice,
i
retract
my
question.
it
would
have
to
exist
because
the
statute's
speaks
of
market
differentials
customarily
applied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
that
marketing
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
in
these
consolidated
cases
which
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
one
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
authority
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
to
include
in
note
marketing
orders
a
provision
for
the
payment
of
a
premium
to
farmers
who
are
located
close
to
the
center
of
the
milk
market.
more
specifically,
the
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
so-called
“farm
differential
payments
in
the
boston
rhode
island
milk
order.
under
which
farmers
whose
farms
are
located
within
40
miles
of
the
center
of
the
market
are
paid
a
differential
over
and
above
it
the
blended
price
of
all
farmers
receive
are
46
cents
per
100
pounds
of
milk
which
is
the
equivalent
of
one
cent
a
quart.
there's
also
a
provision
in
the
order
which
provide
for
payment
of
23
cents
a
100
pounds
for
farmers
who
are
located
in
the
next
area
40
to
in
effect,
40
to
80
miles
from
the
center
of
the
mark.
but
that
involves
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
differentials
involved
in
under
the
order
and
i
therefore
sure
limit
my
discussion
because
its
considerations
of
equally
applicable
to
the
46
cent
differential.
the
present
case
brought
as
a
class
action
is
by
farmers
in
vermont
who
are
located
beyond
the
area
covered
by
these
differentials
and
therefore
under
the
order
and
not
eligible
for
them.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
with
the
statute
does
not
authorized
these
particular
differentials
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
and
payment
of
the
differential.
in
so
ruling
of
the
court
appeals
relied
squarely
on
an
earlier
case
which
i
shall
discuss
called
blair
against
freeman
which
it
struck
down
a
similar
differential
in
a
new
york-new
jersey
milk
marketing
order
and
i'd
also
say
that
the
outset
that
these
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
include
this
differentials
contrary
to
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
1939,
30
years
ago
which
specifically
held
these
particular
differentials.
now,
to
put
these
statutory
issues
in
the
appropriate
frame
of
reference,
first,
i
just
very
briefly
like
it,
refresh
the
court
on
what
i'm
sure
is
already
familiar
to
it.
the
peculiarities
of
the
way
in
which
milk
is
sold
in
the
problems
that
require
this
kind
of
legislation,
and
then
i'd
like
to
sketch
the
legislative
history
of
full
statutes
involved
and
finally
to
describe
the
administrative
background
of
this
order
and
its
predecessors.
we
start
with
the
fact
of
course,
that
milk
basically
has
two
uses.
the
use
of
milk
as
fluid
milk
for
drinking
purposes
which
is
known
as
class
i
use
and
then
the
use
of
other
milk
for
manufactured
purposes,
butter,
cheese,
ice
cream
which
is
known
as
class
ii
purposes.
the
demand
for
so-called
fluid
milk,
milk
for
drinking
is
relatively
static
throughout
the
whole
year.
but
unfortunately
for
the
milk
industry,
the
production
of
the
cows
is
not
static.
the
cows
produce
more
milk
in
the
spring
and
the
summer
than
they
do
in
the
fall
and
the
winter.
so,
this
means
in
order
to
meet
the
uniform
demand
for
class
milk,
one
milk
throughout
the
year,
it
is
necessary
to
add
sufficient
cows
to
produce
that
amount
during
the
winter
months.
when
they're
not
producing
as
much
and
accordingly,
the
result
is
in
the
spring
and
summer
months,
there
is
a
surplus
of
milk
production.
milk
of
course
is
a
highly
perishable
commodity
and
the
result
is
that
milk
that
is
produced
of
the
great
distance
from
the
market
cannot
compete
with
locally
produced
milk
for
the
class
i
use.
although
of
course,
it
can
compete
the
class
ii
use.
that
is
in
the
boston
market,
fresh
milk
from
wisconsin
cannot
compete
with
massachusetts'
milk,
but
obviously
manufactured
cheese
from
wisconsin
easily
competes
with
manufactured
cheese
from
the
massachusetts
area.
now
traditionally,
milk
is
which
is
used
for
class
i
purposes
has
commanded
a
substantially
higher
price
in
the
market
than
milk
that
is
used
for
class
ii
purposes.
now,
the
result
of
this
combination
of
fact,
this
has
been
that
without
any
regulation
drastic
and
devastating
cut
throat
competition
developed
among
the
farmers
to
try
to
get
their
milk
sold
for
the
class
i
use
which
would
yield
them
a
higher
amount.
the
dairies
for
example
would
play
different
farmers
off
against
each
other
driving
the
prices
down.
and
as
a
result
by
the
time
of
the
depression
in
the
earlier
1930's,
the
milk
prices
had
been
drastically
reduced
and
in
some
instance,
farmers
--
where
farmers
were
forced
to
sell
milk
at
less
than
their
cost.
now,
in
order
to
stabilize
this
completely
disorganized
milk
market,
two
purposes
were
achieved.
first,
it
was
important
to
raise
the
price
of
milk
and
secondly,
it
was
important
to
avoid
the
destructive
competition
among
farmers
to
try
to
get
access
to
this
class
i
market.
and
the
secretary
in
the
boston
area
has
followed
the
same
practice
that
he
has
followed
in
most
other
areas.
he
employs
a
system
of
so-called
market
pooling.
under
which,
the
amount
each
farmer
receives
for
his
milk
doe
not
depend
upon
the
particular
use
that
that
farmer's
milk
is
put.
he
gets
the
same
price
whether
or
not
his
milk
is
use
all
for
class
i
purposes,
all
for
class
ii
purposes,
or
in
some
blend.
the
way
this
is
done
is
by
the
use
of
a
so-called
blended
price.
under
which,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
sets
minimum
prices
for
class
i
and
class
ii
milk,
then
determines
how
or
for
what
purposes
the
milk.
all
the
milk
sold
in
the
market
has
been
used
and
on
this
basis
calculates
the
total
value
of
the
milk.
then
in
effect
device
this
by
the
total
volume
and
ends
up
with
a
blended
price
with
each
farmer's
to
receive
and
by
definition
of
this
price,
of
course,
is
less
than
the
class
i
price
and
there
something
more
than
the
class
ii
price.
now,
the
particular
milk
dealers,
the
dairies,
the
manufactures
who
are
in
the
statute
to
call
handlers,
what
happens
to
them
is
if
a
particular
dealer
sells
of
more
milk
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i'll
just
add
some
if
they're
in
explained,
just
take
me
one
minute.
if
the
particular
deal
or
sales
more
of
his
milk
for
class
i
use
which
means
he
would
under
this
calculation
receive
more
than
he
has
to
pay
his
dairies,
he
in
effect
pays
the
excess
into
this
producer's
settlement
fund.
conversely,
if
more
of
the
milk
is
use
to
class
ii
purposes
so
that
he
would
not
get
enough
on
this
calculation
to
pay
his
farmers
what
they're
entitled
to,
he
draws
on
this
producer
settlement
fund,
and
the
result
is
everyone
gets
the
same
price.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
one
thing
very
clear
that
in
determining
the
blended
price
pay
to
all
farmers
under
the
statute,
these
differentials
are
deducted
before
this
is
calculated
that
is
out
of
the
pool
which
is
divided
among
the
all
farmers.
there
is
first
pay
out
of
various
of
statutory
differentials.
and
that
of
course
is
why
we
have
this
case
because
the
effect
of
taking
out
the
46
cent
nearby
farm
differential
in
the
boston
milk
market
is
to
reduce
by
12
cents,
the
blended
price
that
is
paid
to
all
the
farmers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
they
come
off
the
top
and
then
what
is
left
is
divided
up
and
the
theme
of
my
argument
will
be
that
that
precisely
would
congress
intended
the
scheme
to
be.
now,
these
farm
location
differentials
had
their
origins
a
long
time
ago.
in
the
marketing
practices
at
the
1920's,
the
mid
1920's,
long
before,
there
was
any
federal
regulation.
but
that
period
under
contracts
that
the
various
of
the
dairies
had
with
cooperatives.
farmers,
whose
farms
were
located
close
to
the
boston
area,
received
the
greater
amount
with
their
milk
than
farmers
whose
farms
were
located
distance
away.
and
when
i
say
a
greater
amount
and
i
will
keep
referring
to
the
greater
amount,
i
want
to
stress
one
thing
because
this
is
--
there's
a
challenge
by
our
opponents.
this
was
an
amount
that
exceeded
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
transportation
between
bringing
milk
in
from
the
distance
and
from
nearby.
the
indications
are
that
these
men
received
roughly
a
dollar
more
for
100
pounds
which
again
in
a
very
rough
estimate
was
very
close
to
the
46
cents
that
they
now
receive
under
the
boston
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
were
numbered.
they
are
numbered
mr.
justice.
one
of
them
was
the
fact
of
course
that
the
farmers
located
close
to
the
market
would
traditionally
able
to
sell
more
of
their
milk
at
the
class
i
use
which
produced
the
higher
price.
in
addition
to
that,
the
farmers
who
are
close
in
over
the
years
had
been
able
to
make
their
milk
production
more
even
which
was
of
advantage
to
the
handlers
to
the
dairies
and
then
in
the
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
its
not
that
its
not
so
much
of
the
geographical
locate,
just
developed
over
the
years
that
they
found
that
in
order
to
do
business
with
the
handlers
who
is
selling
the
most
of
the
milk
for
class
i
uses,
it
was
important
to
continue
--
for
their
relationship
that
they
have
an
even
production.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
well
this
entails
them
apparently
in
very
involved
farming
practices
through
the
use
of
artificial
insemination.
they
are
able
at
some
cost
to
spread
the
milk
production
over.
the
expression
they
use
is
the
cows
of
freshened,
and
apparently,
the
cows
of
freshened
some
of
them
in
a
way
that
they
produced
their
milk
in
the
fall
and
in
the
winter
rather
than
in
the
spring
and
summer,
and
that
is
the
technique
they
use.
now,
there's
another
advantage
of
course
to
the
producers
of
having
this
relationship
with
the
nearby
farmers
which
is
that
these
men
were
available
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
that
is
if
sudden
those
days
if
late
in
the
day,
they
suddenly
discovered
they
needed
more
milk,
they
could
just
send
a
truck
out
and
get
this
milk
more
easily,
then
if
they
have
to
go
a
great
distance
away
when
we
didn't
have
modern
methods
of
refrigeration,
and
also
of
course
in
bad
weather.
if
you
had
a
very
bad
snow
storm
in
the
area,
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
the
source
of
supply.
now,
when
congress
passed
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
in
1933,
very
early
in
the
administration
of
this
act,
the
secretary
issued
a
so-called
license
to
the
boston
border.
this
was
the
predecessor
to
the
present
order
type
of
arrangement.
and
under
this
license,
the
license
continued
the
previous
advantage
that
the
nearby
farmers
had
enjoyed.
that
is
the
nearby
farmers
got
more
for
their
milk
than
the
distant
farmers.
to
be
sure,
it
was
not
in
the
present
form
of
the
differential.
it
was
not
paying
them
a
certain
amount
over
and
above
the
regular
price.
it
was,
however,
reflected
a
high
up
price
paid
for
milk
from
the
nearby
farm
is
then
was
paid
for
the
distant
farm
farmers.
two
years
later
from
reasons
unrelated
to
the
differentially,
boston
license
was
invalidated
by
a
district
court
decision.
partly
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
schechter
case,
congress
in
1935
amended
the
agriculture
adjustment
act.
the
amendment
added
the
identical
language
it
is
now
in
section
8c
(5)
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
couple
of
minutes
dealing
with
milk
marketing
orders.
and
in
making
these
amendments,
the
committee
report
stated
that
the
provisions
dealing
with
milk
marketing
and
distribution
and
i
quote,
“follow
the
methods
employed
by
cooperative
associations
of
producers
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act.”
now
shortly
thereafter,
a
new
order
was
issued
for
boston
in
1936.
this
order
for
the
first
time
specifically
provided
for
higher
prices
to
any
farmer
whose
farm
is
located
within
40
miles
of
the
state
house
of
boston.
again,
it
provided
of
them
not
for
the
mechanism
of
differential
a
premium
to
this
nearby
for
farmers
of
approximately
46
cents.
this
was
done
by
providing
that
these
nearby
farmers
want
to
receive
the
class
i
price
rather
than
the
somewhat
low
of
branded
--
blended
price.
this
order
remain
in
effect
for
only
six
months
when
another
district
court
in
massachusetts
upheld
the
amended
statute
unconstitutional.
the
secretary
then
suspended
the
order
and
the
order
remained
suspended
until
congress
had
passed
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937.
that
act
utilized
and
bought
in
the
identical
language
dealing
with
milk
marketing
orders
that
had
been
under
the
1935
amendments
to
the
triple
act.
but
in
addition
to
this,
there
was
a
specific
provision
in
the
1937
act
section

that
stated,
that
it
expressly
ratified,
legalized
and
confirmed
all
existing
licenses
market
orders
and
provisions
that
had
been
issued
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
and
its
amendments.
the
secretary
reinstated
the
farm
location
differential
in
the
boston
milk
marketing
order
in
1937
and
this
time,
for
the
first
instance,
explicitly
provided
for
the
46-cent
and
then
the
23-cent
differential
depending
upon
the
distance
from
boston.
and
since
that
time,
since
1937,
every
milk
marketing
order,
the
secretary
has
issued
for
this
new
england
area
has
included
similar
differentials
both
the
amount
of
46
cents
and
the
40
miles
within
the
center
of
the
market.
this
included
1949
marketing
orders
for
springfield
and
wister,
1958
when
he
passed/adopted
an
order
for
southeast
to
new
england
consisting
of
rhode
island
and
southern
massachusetts.
and
finally,
in
1964
when
after
extensive
hearings,
the
secretary
consolidated
before
previous
orders
for
this
area
into
the
present
order.
and
i
would
just
like
to
quote
three
sentences
which
we
set
forth
at
our
brief
on
pages
16
to
18
in
which
the
secretary
explained
why
in
1964,
he
was
reject
in
both
proposals
to
eliminate
the
differential
and
proposals
on
the
other
side
of
the
differential
should
be
increased.
he
said
as
follows.
such
farm
location
differentials
have
been
in
effect
under
the
several
new
england
orders
since
the
inception
of
the
orders.
the
differentials
were
adopted
to
reflect
in
the
pricing
structure
of
the
orders,
historical
price
relationships
by
location
which
prevailed
in
these
markets.
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
page
14
to
15
of
our
brief.
it's
also
contained
in
the
record
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
found
that
customarily
somewhat
higher
values,
above
those
which
normally
reflect
the
transportation
costs,
attached
to
milk
produced
near
the
principle
consumption
centers
as
compare
to
the
market
value
of
milk
produced
in
a
more
distant
areas
of
the
milk
shade.
so,
if
i
may
just
very
briefly
recapitulate
what
i
think
we
have
before
us
is
the
following.
first,
since
before
the
time
of
federal
regulation,
farmers
located
close
to
the
boston
and
new
england
milk
marketing
areas
have
always
received
more
for
their
milk
over
above
the
transportation
differential
than
farmers
located
further
away.
secondly,
that
when
congress
in
1937
passed
the
agricultural
marketing
adjustment
agreement
act,
it
ratified
confirmed
and
legalized
all
previous
licenses,
orders
and
provisions
which
of
course,
included
the
nearby
differential
provisions
of
the
boston
orders.
just
in
passing,
the
court
of
appeals
discounted
this
and
said,
it
believed
that
all
of
that
provision
was
intended
to
do
is
to
avoid
a
lapse
under
the
statute,
and
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
while
we
think
that
while
that
was
one
of
the
purposes,
the
legislative
history
also
indicates
that
was
further
intended
to
approve
and
confirmed
and
ratify
everything
that
had
been
done
before.
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
statutory
provisions
involve
in
the
case
which
we
think
determine
the
in
control
or
legality
of
the
farm
location
differentials.
they're
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
pages
2
to
4
of
our
brief
and
it
begins
the
statutes
speaks
of
milk
and
its
products
terms
and
conditions
or
orders
it
says
in
the
case
of
milk
and
its
products.
orders
pursuant
to
this
section
shall
contain
one
or
more
of
the
following
terms
and
conditions
and
accept
this
provide
else
when
no
others.
and
then
over
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
it
should
to
provide
--
milk
orders
may
provide
for
the
payment
to
all
producers
and
associations
of
producers,
delivering
milk
to
all
handlers
of
uniform
prices
for
all
milk
so
delivered,
irrespective
of
the
uses
made
of
such
milk
by
the
individual
handler
to
whom
it
is
delivered.
and
then
it
goes
on
it
says,
subject
only
to
adjustments
for
volume,
market
and
production
differentials
customarily
applied
by
the
handlers
subject
to
such
order.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
these
orders
were
beyond
the
secretary's
authority
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
apparently
believe
that
the
irrespective
of
the
use
provision
by
any
consideration
of
the
fact
that
historically
farmers
were
receiving
a
higher
amount
for
their
milk
because
a
larger
portion
of
that
was
available
in
use
for
class
i
purposes.
and
secondly,
the
court
said,
this
in
any
event
was
not
a
market
differential
as
that
term
is
use
in
the
statute.
now,
i
first
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
irrespective
of
uses
clause
which
the
court
in
this
case
relied
squarely
on
the
prior
holding
in
blair.
and
after
saying
that
it
accepted
the
whole
naturally
the
holding
in
blair
that
you,
secretary
was
barred
from
taking
any
account
of
the
prior
use
of
the
milk,
and
then
went
on
and
examine
what
the
secretary
had
said
in
this,
this
case
in
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
statements
over
the
time
that
he
promulgated
all
the
orders.
that
in
fact,
he
had
relied
on
this
impermissible
factor.
now,
we
think
that
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
court
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
secretary
did
not
mr.
justice
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
we
study
the
case,
we
felt
there
were
various
factors
in
it
that
would
not
make
in
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
reveiw
by
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
yes
mr.
justice.
for
one
thing
in
the
blair
case,
the
secretary
had
relied
solely
on
the
fact
of
the
use
of
the
milk.
that
is
the
higher
percentage
class
used,
class
i
use.
whereas
in
this
case,
we
think
he
has
indicated
that
the
other
factors.
secondly
in
the
blair
case,
the
secretary
relied
solely
on
the
claim
not
that
this
was
a
market
differential,
but
this
was
another
of
the
statutory
differentials
relating
to
the
place
at
which
the
milk
was
delivered.
that
was
the
sole
basis
of
this
opinion
at
the
blair
case.
and
for
those
reasons
quite
frankly,
we
did
not
feel
that
case
would
be
inappropriate
one
to
take
to
this
court
for
presenting
the
broad
question
of
the
secretary's
authority
to
include
these
provisions.
now,
this
cost
it
seems
to
us
the
irrespective
abuse
clause
it
seems
to
us,
has
nothing
to
do
with
differentials
at
all.
rather,
it's
purpose
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
secretary
may
pay
a
uniform
price
to
all
farmers
even
though
a
particular
farmer's
milk
was
sold
for
the
higher
class
i
use
than
someone
else's
milk.
indeed,
it
was
that
factor
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
unsuccessful
attack
in
this
court
in
the
rock
royal
cooperative
case
in
307
u.s.
upon
the
whole
marketing
equalization
program
that
contention
there
was
that
it
denied
the
farmer
of
his
milk
was
being
use
for
class
i
purposes.
it
took
us
property
without
due
process
of
law
and
it
was
discriminatory
that
he
didn't
get
the
full
value
of
his
milk,
that
he
got
only
the
blended
price.
and
we
think
in
stark
against
wickard,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
that.
now
of
course
under
this
arrangement,
all
of
the
farmers,
all
of
the
nearby
farmers
get
the
identical
price
for
their
milk
without
regard
to
the
use
made
of
their
milk
by
the
particular
handlers.
statute
speaks
and
the
use
is
made
of
that
such
milk
by
the
individual
handler
to
whom
it
is
delivered.
every
single
one
of
the
farmers
located
within
this
nearby
area
gets
the
blended
price,
plus
the
differential.
he
gets
it
whether
his
handler
sells
all
of
his
milk
for
class
i
use,
all
of
his
milk
for
class
ii
use
or
some
blend.
and
we
fail
for
a
think
that
the
validity
of
these
differentials
does
not
at
all
depend
upon
the
irrespective
of
use
clause
that
the
way
of
determine
the
validity
of
these
differentials
is
looking
to
the
next
clause
which
deals
with
the
adjustments
and
differentials.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
the
critical
question
in
the
case
is
whether
this
market
different
leaves,
differentials
are
market
differentials
customarily
applied
by
the
handlers.
the
act
of
course
does
not
define
market
differentials,
and
we
think
what
this
phrase
means
is
a
differential
that
customarily
has
been
applied
by
the
handlers
in
the
market.
now
in
the
light
of
the
history
i
have
given,
the
statutory
history
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
the
a
and
it
would
be
forget
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
market
differentials
over
to
the
top
customarily
applied
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
handlers
subject
to
set
forth.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
think
that
in
the
light
of
the
history
i
have
given,
the
previous
experience
before
federal
regulation,
the
history
shown
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
procedures
formerly
applied
by
the
cooperatives,
the
confirmation
and
ratification
of
1937
that
this
definition
cannot
be
given
the
very
narrow
reading
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
them.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
all
it
is
covered
by
the
phrase
market
differential
is
payments
which
a
farmer
receives
extra
payments
for
delivering
his
milk
to
the
country
--
city
plant
rather
than
to
the
country
plant.
that
is,
it's
a
differential
for
delivering
they
say
in
the
city
market
rather
than
the
country
market.
that
interpretation
rest
on
a
statement
in
the
committee
reports
which
so
describes
the
market
differential.
we
think
in
the
light
of
all
this
history
that
this
decrypting
was
merely
intended
to
be
illustrative
of
the
type
of
market
differential
and
it
was
not
intended
to
define
the
outer
limits
of
the
differential.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
it's
somewhat
complicated
the
reasons
why
if
this
language
was
construed
as
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it,
it
would
not
be
particularly
meaningful.
there
be
other
phrase
of
the
statute
that
will
embrace
the
type
of
differential
at
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
the
market
differential.
now
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
in
1939,
the
first
circuit
upheld
the
validity
of
the
market
differentials
in
the
1937
boston
milk
marketing
order
and
express
--
explicitly
held
that
they
were
market
differentials.
and
in
addition
to
that
as
we
develop
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
rock
royal
case,
although,
it
dealt
not
with
differentials
paid
on
a
market
wise
basis
but
by
individual
handlers,
nevertheless
since
the
operative
language
of
the
two
sets
in
the
statute
is
the
same
as
equally
applicable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
just
suggested
that
this
was
one
of
the
types
things.
i
don't
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
the
committee
was
saying
that
is
all
a
market
differential
means.
i
think,
in
the
light
of
the
history
in
the
broad
language
market
differential,
it
was
intended
to
give
the
secretary
the
authority
to
continue
this
payment.
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
whole
history
of
this
statute
shows
that,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
stabilize
milk
markets
to
eliminate
the
cut
throat
competition
within
the
existing
pricing
structure.
it
is
not
intended
to
radically
alter
the
relationships
that
it
existed
from
many
years
among
the
different
groups
of
producers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
that
mr.
justice,
it
was
the
fact
that
payments
would
tied
to
the
end
use
that
led
to
this
drastic
and
devastating
competition
among
the
farmers
driving
down
the
price.
and
that's
what
they
were
attempting
to
do,
it
seems
to
us,
was
to
eliminate
as
a
fact
that
leading
to
the
depressing
of
milk
prices.
farmers
fighting
each
other
to
see
which
one
could
have
the
greatest
share
of
the
class
i
market
and
preventing
the
handlers
from
using
this
is
to
leaver
to
fight
them.
but
once
that
was
accomplished,
once
that
type
of
the
limp
competition
was
eliminated,
it
seems
that
what
cut
to
us
that
would
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
say
that
that
was
as
far
as
you
could
go.
you
could
eliminate
this
type
of
pricing
competition
that
was
not
to
be
the
radical
realignment,
the
radical
changing
of
the
structure
of
the
milk
marketing
that
is
results
from
this
decision
below.
now,
the
respondents
repeatedly
tell
us
that
this
is
a
very
unfair
thing
that
the
effect
of
this
differential
is
basically
requiring
the
farmers
in
the
distant
markets
to
subsidies
a
nearby
farms.
and
they
say,
if
in
fact
this
nearby
milk
has
some
value
to
do
the
handlers,
let
the
handlers
pay
for
it.
don't
make
us
pay
for
it.
this
again
it
seems
to
us
rests
on
the
mistaken
notion
that
under
the
act,
all
farmers
have
to
be
treated
equally.
we
think
under
the
act,
what
it
is
that
all
farmers
are
to
be
treated
equitably.
that
is
they
are
to
receive
the
same
prices
subject
to
the
various
differentials
provided.
and
if
as
we
believe
the
market
differentials
that
here
are
permissible
that
farm
location
differentials
are
valid
as
market
differentials,
it
seems
it's
quite
immaterial
with
the
effect
of
paying
this
differential
as
to
reduce
the
blended
price.
that's
precisely
we
think,
but
the
statute
contemplates.
and
if
the
handlers
would
give
them
discretion
to
decide
to
whom
to
make
payments
for
the
additional
values,
how
much
under
what
circumstances
fee
--
its
very
clear.
this
will
be
exactly
this
sort
of
thing
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent;
the
same
kind
of
cut
throat
competition
that
you
have
back
in
the
early
days.
and
finally,
the
arc
man
it
seems
to
us
rests
on
a
mistaken,
at
least,
a
dubious
factual
assumption,
the
assumption
that
somehow,
if
you'll
eliminated
the
nearby
differential
and
increase
the
blended
price,
the
distant
farmers
would
be
much
better
off.
well
of
course
they'll
be
much
better
off
immediately.
they
get
12
cents
more
a
100-pound,
but
it
doesn't
follow
at
all.
but
in
the
long
run,
they'll
be
any
better
off
because
once
you
increase
the
blended
price
in
the
boston
market,
the
result
is
likely
to
be
that
handlers
operating
in
other
areas
will
begin
to
bring
their
milk
into
the
boston
market.
this
will
create
a
surplus.
this
in
turn
will
result
in
depressing
the
price
in
the
boston
market
and
the
end
result
for
all
that
appears
is
that
the
prices
maybe
driven
down,
indeed
even
below
the
present
level.
and
then
there's
another
problem
is
which
is
that
everyone
knows
farms
is
having
a
hard
time
today
that
the
nearby
farmers
for
more
than
30
years
have
acted
on
the
assumption
that
would
receive
this
differentials.
that
these
differentials
have
suddenly
terminated.
there's
a
reason
to
believe
that
a
large
number
of
nearby
farmers
in
the
boston
area
have
may
decide
either
that
they
can
use
their
land
more
profitably
for
something
other
than
farming
and
they
sell
out
to
the
real
estate,
subdivided
it,
etcetera.
so,
the
end
result
again
is
likely
that
it
be
a
serious
shortage
of
milk
for
the
nearby
area
and
once
again,
leading
to
great
instability
in
the
market.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
fourth
brief
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
in
each
of
them
really
arises
in
response
to
a
question
of
number
from
--
of
the
court.
first,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
the
question
of
the
origin
of
this
phrase
“nearby
differentials”.
i
think
that's
colloquial
phrase
but
what
the
secretary,
the
word
secretary
used
in
this
order
in
1964,
he
spoke
of
it
as
farm
location
differentials.
farm
location
differential
which
i
think
is
a
more
accurate
representation.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
whether
anybody
would
loose
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
they
were
presented
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgments
and
it
is
referred
to
at
page
84
of
the
record,
affidavits
by
some
of
the
nearby
farmers
which
indicated
that
if
this
differential
is
abandoned,
if
this
differential
is
struck
out,
they
will
in
fact
not
be
getting
back
the
total
expenses
as
result
of
the
blended
price
they
received.
and
then
i'd
like
to
refer
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
finding
on
that,
no
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
two
questions
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
the
first
you
inquired
mr.
justice
as
to
how
the
cooperatives
vote?
they
do
vote
as
a
unit.
that
is
if
there
is
a
division
all
the
votes
are
cast
in
one
way.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
very
clear
that
if
that
this
vote
must
represent
from
votes
of
the
majority
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
of
course,
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
when
this
1964
order
was
put
to
a
vote,
it
was
approve
by
something
like
89%
of
all
the
farmers
in
the
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
take
it
or
leave
it
and
then
many
situations
--
this
is
true
of
many
situations,
you
face
when
you've
deciding
whether
to
do
something
with
the
pros
and
the
cons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
finally,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
a
minute
about
this
point
that
they
are
only
two
other
orders
in
the
whole
united
states
that
have
this
provision.
originally,
a
few
years
ago,
there
were
four
orders.
the
new
york-new
jersey
order
that
was
struck
down,
an
order
in
chicago
which
was
subsequently
vacated
because
of
the
unwillingness
of
the
handlers
to
accept
certain
changes.
the
present
order
which
been
struck
down
and
the
connecticut
order
which
of
course
is
now
under
litigation
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
cranston
case.
while,
these
are
only
four
out
of
70
orders,
they
it
covered
roughly
40%
of
all
the
milk
production
in
the
united
states.
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
something
which
i
think
it's
quite
significant.
there's
testimony
in
this
record
at
page
549
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
it.
as
to
the
extent
of
the
hold's
problem
of
how
these
differentials
come
into
being,
what
that
causes
is
549
statements
--
statement
that
in
the
state
of
california
and
the
state
of
california
is
a
state,
one
of
the
states
that
has
no
federal
regulation
at
all.
this
is
statement
of
state
of
california,
produces
located
nearby
los
angeles
distributing
plants
are
able
to
obtain
more
favorable
contracts
and
thus,
a
higher
class
i
utilization
then
produces
that
are
located
in
the
central
valley
or
any
other
place.
in
order
words,
even
without
a
milk
marketing
order
at
the
present
time,
handlers
are
willing
to
pay
more
to
farmers
who
located
near
the
or
--
near
the
center
of
the
market
than
to
distant
farmers.
no
coercion,
no
claimant,
the
distant
farmers
are
required
to
accept
to
the
--
quite
accept
this.
this
is
the
operation,
the
normal
operation
of
the
market
and
i
think
the
reason
why
we
don't
have
anymore
of
these
provisions
in
milk
marketing
orders
is
just
the
way
markets
have
a
reason.
some
of
the
areas
of
the
country,
smaller
areas
what
has
happen
is
you
haven't
had
the
problem.
the
farmers
had
been
closer
in.
you
haven't
hired
this
kind
of
competition
for
the
class
i
market
characterized
these
eastern
markets.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if,
if
depending
on
what
the
circumstances,
if
that
he
have
--
if
an
appear
that
prior
to
the
time
of
the
marketing
order,
they
had
this
existing
--
i
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
if
for
example
the
secretary
found,
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
--
yes,
it
would
have
to
exist
mr.
justice,
i
retract
my
question.
it
would
have
to
exist
because
the
statute's
speaks
of
market
differentials
customarily
applied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
that
marketing
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
