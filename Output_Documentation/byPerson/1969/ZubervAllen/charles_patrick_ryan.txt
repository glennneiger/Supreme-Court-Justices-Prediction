mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
mr.
justice
black
and
members
of
the
court.
first,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations.
this
particular
differential
has
no
relationship
at
all
to
any
40-mile
zone
from
any
principal
consumption
center
or
the
city
of
boston
or
any
other
city.
that
was
true
of
the
1937
greater
boston
order.
but
at
the
present
time
under
the
consolidated
orders,
all
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
connecticut
and
all
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
massachusetts
other
than
one
county
are
all
classified
as
nearby
producers.
initially,
the
under
the
greater
boston
market
order,
there
were
over
7,400
distant
producers
serving
that
market.
they
supplied
approximately
92%
of
the
milk.
at
that
time,
there
were
672
nearby
producers.
and
at
the
present
time
as
the
petitioners
have
indicated,
there
are
over
2,000
approximately
2,200
nearby
producers.
short
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
approximately
one
third.
the
significance
--
the
significance
of
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
is
this.
that
under
the
boston
order,
the
distant
producers,
so-called
distant
producers
only
paid
under
this
nearby
differential.
two
to
three
cents
per
hundredweight,
they
did
not
have
to
pay
the
46
cents
simply
for
the
reason
if
they
were
so
many
distant
producers.
as
their
numbers
have
been
cut
and
as
the
nearby
producers
have
increased
in
number,
the
differential
that
is
deducted
from
their
milk
price
has
grown.
initially,
it
was
a
factor
that
was
regarded
as
admittedly
illegal,
but
that
they
could
afford
to
wink
at
it
so
to
speak,
in
order
to
get
the
benefits
of
federal
regulation.
but
at
the
present
time
it
has
grown
like
the
proverbial
topsy
and
it
has
a
resulted
in
its
incorporation
and
to
other
others
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
existed
in
the
boston
order.
now
on
that
connection,
i
think
its
important
to
realize
that
this
particular
differential
exist
in
only
one
other
milk
order
in
the
united
states
out
of
approximate
75
federal
milk
marketing
orders.
that
fact
conclusively
indicates
that
is
not
a
vital
provision.
it's
not
a
necessary
provision.
the
only
effect
that
it
has
is
to
discriminate
against
the
marketings
of
distant
producers.
the
only
other
milk
order
which
contain
is
particular
differential
is
a
connecticut
federal
milk
marketing
order.
and
that
illustrates
very
graphically
the
injury
that
a
differential
provision
of
this
type
can
effect
upon
distant
producers.
under
the
connecticut
milk
order,
there
are
only
89
to
95
dairy
farmers
that
are
characterized
as
distant
or
non-nearby
dairy
farmers.
there
are
approximately
2,000
that
are
characterized
as
nearby
dairy
farmers.
all
of
your
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
connecticut
are
termed
nearby
dairy
farmers
even
though
at
least
50%
of
the
milk
for
that
market
is
supplied
by
out
of
state
dairy
farmers.
now,
the
result
is
under
the
computation
in
that
exactly
reverse
situation
that
the
distant
dairy
farmers
marketing
under
that
order
have
to
pay
44
cents
for
every
hundred
pounds
of
milk
of
their
needed
milk
that
they
regularly
market
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
how
this
is
benefit
the
connecticut
nearby
producer?
it
increases
his
price
not
by
46
cents
but
by
2
cents
per
hundredweight.
that
is
simply
a
trivital
to
the
fact
that
there
are
not
enough
distant
producers
to
pay
this
differential.
the
distant
producers
under
that
order
loose
from
$5,000.00
to
$6,000.00
a
year
in
order
to
benefit
the
nearby
producer
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$12.50
a
month.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
in
this
case,
no
your
honor.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
i'm
talking
about
how
that
it
exist
and
only
one
other
order
out
about
75
in
the
countries
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
that
order
incidentally
is
functioning
much
better
than
it
ever
has
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
dairy
farmers
are
able
to
cooperate
and
act
in
harmony.
instead
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
one
reason
why
i
brought
in
the
connecticut
order.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
it
is
very
confusing.
the
distant
farmer
in
vermont,
take
for
example,
if
he
wants
to
market
his
milk,
his
needed
milk,
although,
he
is
supplied
boston,
say
for
instance
for
over
30
years.
he
has
to
pay
this
differential
to
nearby
producers
located
in
the
states
of
connecticut
and
massachusetts
and
rhode
island.
rhode
island
is
a
very
small
factor.
they
produce
only
about
1%
of
the
milk
for
the
market
and
are
not
significant
factor
in
the
case.
however,
if
the
vermont
producer
or
the
main
producer
of
the
new
hampshire
producer
wants
to
market
his
needed
milk
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
he
also
has
to
pay
the
same
differential.
only
this
time
in
a
much
larger
amount.
by
the
same
token,
the
connecticut
producer
collects
both
ways.
he
and
the
rhode
island
producer
does
also.
he
is
entitled
to
this
differential
irrespective
of
what
market
his
milk
goes
to.
so,
it's
not
simply
a
question
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
that
is
in
respect
to
the
order
that
presently
considering.
yes.
in
respect
to
the
connecticut
order,
it
does
encompass
the
entire
state,
and
in
both
orders
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct
and
those
are
the
only
two
milk
orders
in
united
states
that
have
this
particular
provision.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
and
in
fact,
it's
my
contention
and
i
think
this
would
be
substantiated
that
most
nearby
dairy
farmers
are
not
desirers
of
exacting
this
penalty
payment
from
their
fellow
dairy
farmers.
it's
not
necessary
in
any
other
area
of
the
country.
in
this
particular
differential
like
all
others
of
its
type
has
been
brought
about
really
through
the
inconsistence
of
a
very
limited
group
and
it's
been
perpetuated
in
the
same
manner.
now
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
under
our
view.
the
case
except
for
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
shortly
after
the
consolidation
of
these
orders
in
which
the
boston,
southeastern
new
england,
the
worcester
and
the
springfield
orders
were
consolidated
previously.
those
nearby
producers
could
only
obtain
this
particular
differential
by
delivering
to
that
particular
market
that
they
were
associated
with.
after
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
we
represent
by
a
class
action
order
that
was
contested
in
the
district
court.
we
represent
the
distant
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
approximately
6,500
dairy
farmers
and
after
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
at
less
than
it
cost
to
produce,
no.
however
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
my
understanding.
however,
i
will
say
this
that
the
margin
of
profit
is
something
that
very
amongst
different
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
it
does
affect
some
more
than
it
does
others.
for
instance,
when
this
order
consolidated
in
1964
so
that
a
producer
did
no
have
to
have
any
historical
association
with
any
particular
market.
he
could
receive
the
nearby
producer
could
receive
this
differential
irrespective
aware
his
milk
was
delivered.
then,
we
find
that
approximately
one
year,
within
one
year,
at
least
1,000
distant
dairy
farmers
were
forced
out
of
business
by
this
particular
differential.
now,
we
do
make
that
claim
and
we
think
it's
substantiated.
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
what
we
regard
the
congressional
program
to
be
here.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
i
was
coming
to
that
in
period
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
it
represents
the
view
the
secretary
of
agriculture
only
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
included
in
these
two
orders
out
of
about
75
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
his
actual
finding
in
1964
was
that
the
differential
was
not
resulting
in
such
disorderly
conditions
as
with
warrant,
its
deletion
at
this
time.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
proper
finding.
number
one
under
the
act,
he
is
definitely
obligated
to
find
that
not
only
the
order
but
the
every
provision
of
the
order
will
tend
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act.
and
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
what
i'm
saying
there
is
that
he
also
fail
to
make
the
proper
finding
even
assuming
that
he
have
this
power.
but
we
are
saying
that
he
definitely
does
not
have
this
power
that
a
more
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
a
more
basic
violation
of
the
act
could
not
be
comprehended.
it's
our
contention
that
initially
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
was
passed
for
the
simple
reason
that
all
dairy
farmers
were
receiving
very
low
prices
for
the
milk.
the
fact
that
some
dairy
farmers
have
received
higher
prices
than
others
in
the
1920's
has
no
real
relevancy
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
private
sector
of
the
milk
industry
that
cooperatives
and
so
forth,
there
were
varying
prices
that
actually
contributed
to
the
market
instability
here
and
it
resulted
eventually
in
all
producers
receiving
low
prices
for
their
milk,
below
the
cost
the
production
actually
in
the
1929
to
'33
period.
and
consequently
because
of
the
fact
that
a
state
as
this
court
held
in
bowman
versus
ceiling
could
not
regulate
the
price
of
milk
that
moved
across
interstate
borders,
the
congress
was
force
to
meet
this
problem
by
the
enactment
of
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
of
1933.
that
provided
primarily
for
solving
the
problem
through
marketing
agreements
and
supplementing
licenses.
but
the
licenses
and
the
marketing
agreements
were
at
that
time
relegated
solely
to
the
prevention
of
unfair
trade
practices
and
the
act
was
very
vague
and
nebulous.
as
a
result,
many
different
features
were
included
within
these
licenses
that
were
doubtful
legality
and
definitely
against
public
policy.
as
a
result,
the
handlers
actually
refuse
to
comply
with
the
different
provisions
of
these
licenses
as
did
the
producers
and
this
compounded
the
situation,
in
fact
that
congress
was
well
aware
from
different
reports
from
the
federal
trade
commission
that
the
situation
was
such
that
the
act
would
have
to
be
amended
if
it
was
to
be
made
workable.
and
in
1935,
they
so
amend
the
act
so
extensively
that
is
referred
to
as
the
1935
act
which
is
the
court
has
also
characterized
it
as
such
some
of
its
decisions
of
that
particular
1935
act
get
away
with
the
licenses
and
included
a
provision
whereby
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
issue
milk
marketing
orders.
but
the
congress
was
very
definite
and
stating
that
these
orders
could
contain
the
enumerated
terms
and
conditions
and
no
others.
the
secretary
of
course
has
discretion
concerning
which
terms
to
include
in
this
particular
others.
but
he
of
course,
cannot
amend
the
act
or
reappeal
by
including
within
it
various
provisions
without
any
statutory
basis.
and
as
the
petitioners
have
indicated
the
primary
problem
involved
here
in
the
milk
industry
is
not
only
that
milk
is
highly
perishable,
but
also
that
there
is
a
surplus
of
milk,
a
necessary
surplus
even
in
a
short
production
season
of
the
year
approximately
20%.
this,
of
course
results
in
a
much
larger
surplus
during
the
flash
production
season
of
the
year
and
this
is
unnecessary
surplus
and
in
a
secretary
has
found
as
recently
as
1957
that
without
regulation.
we
find
that
the
level
of
prices
to
all
producers
would
be
below
the
cost
of
production.
regulation
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
there
are,
although
the
demand
for
milk
is
fairly
constant,
there
are
daily
fluctuations.
for
instance,
during
the
summer
months,
you
have
various
areas
that
the
countries
that
are
resort
areas
for
instance
that
have
an
influx
of
population
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
well,
not
always.
there's
different
--
you
have
in
vermont
for
instance,
the
skiing
dairy
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes
we
do.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
this
is
in
the
right
period.
yes.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
this.
this
is
in
the
record
that
you
have
to
maintain
the
necessary
reserved
in
order
to
protect
the
consumer
by
an
adequate
milk
supply.
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
respondents
here
that
the
congress
was
motivated
to
solve
this
problem
by
apportioning
the
burdens
of
surplus
along
with
the
benefits
of
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price
through
the
issuance
of
a
program
that
call
for
a
uniform
price
to
all
dairy
farmers,
irrespective
of
the
use
of
their
particular
milk.
now,
of
course,
this
was
the
big
problem
that
some
dealers
had
a
fluid
milk
outlet
for
their
milk.
producers
that
were
selling
to
that
particular
handler
or
dealer
where
sometimes
able
to
obtain
a
higher
price
than
other
dairy
farmers
and
other
handlers
serving
another
handler
who
was
able
not
to
sell
in
the
fluid
milk
market.
and
although
the
petitioners
here
cite
the
case
of
rock
royal
is
authority
for
this
differential,
we
contend
that
it
was
--
is
clearly
just
the
opposite
and
the
rock
royal
actually,
it
was
--
there
were
no
producers
before
the
court.
it
was
a
case
that
involves
solely
handlers
and
it
was
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
1937
act.
the
handlers
contended
that
it
violated
their
constitutional
rights
to
require
them
to
pay
a
part
of
the
monies
that
they
have
obtained
from
the
class
i
sales
into
the
market
wide
pool
or
producer
settlement
fund
in
order
that
these
monies
would
be
paid
over
to
other
handlers
who
have
low
fluid
sales.
most
of
their
milk
was
dispose
of
for
manufacturing
purposes,
but
it's
obvious
that
the
congressional
plan
couldn't
work
unless
there
was
a
provision
of
this
nature
and
also
that
congress
did
not
provide
for
any
great
unusual
situation
here.
they
provided
for
minimum
milk
prices
that
the
handler
was
obligated
to
pay
for
milk.
now,
the
court
in
rock
royal
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process
or
the
taking
of
the
handler's
property
to
require
him
to
pay
the
excess
of
his
fluid
sales
over
the
market
wide
average
into
the
producer
settlement
fund
for
distribution
to
other
handlers
who
in
turn
would
pay
these
monies
to
their
own
producers.
now,
its
very
evident
that
if
a
handler
could
not
retain
these
monies
over
the
market
wide
blend
price
and
pay
them
into
his
own
producer
and
was
obligated
to
pay
this
into
the
fund
that
a
dairy
farmers
that
server
that
particular
handler
certainly
couldn't
make
the
same
claim
that
this
could
be
accomplish
indirectly
through
a
nearby
differential.
now,
we
contend
that
the
words
irrespective
of
use
simply
mean
that
a
dairy
farmer
is
entitle
to
the
payment
of
the
uniform
price
irrespective
of
the
use
of
his
milk
and
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
milk
appeal,
they
have
indicated
that
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
language.
now,
the
contentions
of
the
petitioners
would
actually
nullify
the
act,
if
they
were
to
delete
that
language
and
simply
say
that
this
means
that
you
can
pay
a
dairy
farm
around
the
basis
of
use
of
his
milk.
this
is
clearly
just
the
opposite
of
what
the
congress
contended
should
be
done.
now,
the
petitioners
acknowledge
that
in
the
blair
case
that
the
adjustments
to
the
uniform
price
in
that
case
involved
a
location
differential.
location
differential
really
is
nothing
more
than
a
differential
that
is
allowed
for
the
transportation
element
that
enters
into
the
price
of
milk.
milk
that
is
delivered
to
one
part
of
the
milk
shed
naturally
is
has
to
be
delivered
to
the
primary
consumption
center.
these
are
the
large
cities
and
the
dairy
farmer
does
have
to
pay
for
those
transportation
cost.
we
make
no
objection
in
that
regard
even
though
that
does
detract
from
our
milk
price.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
in
our
brief,
we
have
outlined
the
report
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
in
great
detail
and
if
quotes
the
language
of
the
reports
where
the
report
does
say
that
that
location
differential
is
for
transportation
purposes
from
the
place,
from
the
plant
where
the
milk
is
delivered
to
the
principal
consumption
center.
and
you
have
to
have
the
system
whereby
you
set
up
zones
and
fix
a
particular
transportation
charge
for
each
zone
as
related
to
the
principal
consumption
center
because
this
is
the
where
the
milk
is
going,
this
is
where
its
produced.
and
of
course,
the
court
in
blair
held
that
this
was
not
a
proper
differential
to
justify
the
one
that
was
in
the
new
york
order
in
which
was
very
similar
to
the
one
that
is
in
this
order
that
that
related
strictly
to
transportation.
now,
if
the
petitioners
--
i
don't
understand
whether
they
currently
maintain
that
that
is
a
proper
differential
that
would
support
the
location
differential
that
would
support
the
nearby
differential
involve
in
this
case.
but
they
seem
to
be
limiting
their
argument
at
the
present
time
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
market
differential.
now,
the
reports
clearly
state
that
a
market
differential
is
a
differential
that
is
paid
to
a
dairy
farmer
for
delivering
his
milk
to
a
city
market
rather
than
to
a
country
plant
because
in
a
country
plant,
there
are
double
handling
cost
involved.
and
the
measure
of
this
particular
market
differential
is
normally
the
difference
between
the
receiving
cost
that
the
country
plant
and
that
at
the
city
plant.
and
the
dairy
farmers
pay
that
particular
differential
because
he
actually
performs
a
service
there
and
he
accomplishes
a
reduction
and
the
cost
of
the
handler
that
maintains
the
various
country
plants.
now
the
congress,
if
the
reports
are
examined
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
show
that
they
gave
great
consideration
to
this
particular
1935
act
because
of
the
reason
schechter
case
and
the
recent
case
of
panama
versus
ryan,
the
other
particular
case
that
dealt
with
delegation
of
powers.
it
was
very
careful
to
spell
out
in
complete
detail
what
provision
the
secretary
could
include
in
this
milk
orders.
and
we
contend
that
there's
a
no
possible
basis
for
saying
that
there's
any
statutory
justification
for
the
nearby
differential
when
that
particular
differential
is
not
even
mention
either
in
the
act
or
in
any
of
the
reports.
now,
the
act
provides
for
a
volume
market
and
production
differentials
and
our
understanding
of
the
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
the
market
differential
is
simply
illustrative
in
nature.
now
if
this
was
true,
there'd
be
no
point
in
the
congress
specifying
the
volume
differential,
the
production
differential,
the
butter
fat
differential,
the
quality
differential,
the
location
differential.
they
could
simply
have
set
all
customary
market
differentials,
if
this
was
what
they
meant
by
market
differential.
but
it
was
not
and
this
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
reports.
incidentally,
the
nearby
producer
can
deliver
his
milk
to
a
country
plant
and
still
receive
this
nearby
differential.
whereas
the
distant
producer
can
deliver
his
milk
right
to
the
market
center
and
he
does
not
receive
this
differential.
and
in
fact
he
has
to
pay
the
nearby
producer
this
particular
differential
out
of
his
milk
price.
so,
it's
just
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
congress
has
defined
the
market
differential
to
be;
one
for
delivery
to
the
city
market.
also,
the
only
exception
to
the
uniform
price
that
is
authorized
by
the
act
is
one
which
is
provided
for
in
section
8c
(5)
(b)
pertaining
to
new
producers.
the
congress
was
concern
that
handlers
were
bringing
milk
into
various
markets
and
beating
down
local
prices
within
that
reach
of
market.
but
it
was
also
concerned
that
if
wanted
to
make
sure
that
new
producers
would
be
given
reasonable
opportunities
to
enter
markets.
in
other
words,
that
these
would
not
be
close
markets.
consequently,
provision
8c
(5)
(b)
provides
that
a
new
producer
is
to
conceive
the
same
price
as
any
other
producer
after
he
serves
a
particular
market
for
two
months.
now,
the
two
months
probationary
period
is
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
he
is
going
to
regularly
supply
that
market.
during
that
period,
he
receives
the
lowest
price
use
classification
price.
during
that
particular
two
months
and
this
is
to
assure
that
he
will
not
market
his
milk
in
a
particular
region
only
when
it's
an
opportunity
time
for
him
to
do
so.
now,
under
the
particular
provision
8c
(5)
(b)
pertaining
to
new
producers
that
specifically
states
that
that
lowest
used
price
that
he
is
to
receive
during
those
two
months
is
subject
to
all
other
adjustments
authorize
under
the
act.
now
for
instance,
he
would
receive
the
butter
fat
differential
if
his
milk
wanted
it,
he
would
be
subject
to
the
transportation
differential.
he
would
be
subject
to
the
market
differential
for
direct
delivery
of
milk.
but
under
the
act
he
would
also,
if
this
nearby
differential
is
a
valid
differential,
he
would
also
be
subject
to
the
nearby
differential
and
this
would
result
in
a
new
producer
whom
the
act
requires
to
receive
the
lowest
possible
price
during
the
first
two
months
of
his
delivery
because
of
the
fact
that
he
is
never
supplied
this
market.
he
would
receive
a
differential
under
this
nearby
differential
provision
which
would
pay
him
because
of
the
fluid
use
his
milk
on
a
historical
basis,
even
though
he
had
never
supplied
the
market.
now,
this
is
a
double
link
consistency
that
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
congress.
this
is
an
inconsistency
that
is
particularly
applicable
only
to
the
secretary
and
even
if
he
didn't
pay
this
nearby
differential
to
these
new
producers,
this
simply
could
not
be
explain
the
way
by
a
second
violation
because
the
act
requires
that
all
of
the
adjustments
be
taken
into
account
even
in
respect
to
these
new
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
he
has
not
given
a
reason
for
other
markets.
he
has
said
in
respect
to
massachusetts,
rhode
island
and
connecticut
producers
that
historically,
dairy
farmers
in
the
states
of
massachusetts,
rhode
island
and
connecticut
because
of
their
location
with
reference
to
the
large
population
concentrations
of
new
england
have
disposed
of
a
substantially
larger
percentage
of
their
production
for
fluid
use
than
have
dairy
farmers
in
the
up
country
area.
hence,
nearby
producers
have
been
able
to
realize
that
price
higher
in
relation
to
more
distant
producers
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
advantage
of
the
transportation
to
market.
under
market
wide
pooling
here
in
propose
and
without
some
adjustment
mechanism,
the
nearby
producer
notwithstanding
would
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
air
utilization
of
all
milk
in
the
milk
shed
rather
than
according
to
the
utilization
of
his
milk.
now,
this
is
a
direct
admission
of
a
violation
of
the
act
because
the
act
specifically
states
that
no
dairy
farmer
is
to
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
his
milk.
he
is
to
be
paid
a
uniform
price
irrespective
of
the
use
of
his
milk.
the
secretary
also
found
that
under
a
regulated
market,
the
nearby
producer
also
obtains
the
protection
of
the
federal
regulatory
program
and
receives
in
many
instances,
a
higher
price
and
he
would
otherwise
received.
so,
we
come
to
the
a
situation
where
prior
to
federal
regulation,
all
dairy
farmers
where
receiving
low
prices
and
even
prior
to
the
1964
act.
much
of
the
local
produced
milk
had
been
dispose
of
for
manufacturing
your
surplus
purposes
and
its
just
not
an
accuracy
to
say
that
nearby
producers
consistently
supply
the
fluid
milk
market.
in
fact
as
recently
as
1946,
the
secretary
had
to
amend
the
boston
order
because
of
the
fact
that
the
nearby
producers
where
supplying
milk
to
the
country
plants
and
were
receiving
actually
a
higher
price
than
what
they
were
entitled
to
at
those
particular
plants.
now,
we
also
feel
that
this
court's
specifically
stated
in
rock
royal
that
any
variants
between
uniform
prices
would
result
in
a
discrimination
and
would
actually
cause
certain
producers
to
bear
an
unfair
burden
of
the
surplus
market.
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
nearby
differential
does.
it
reserves
the
fluid
milk
market
or
a
larger
percentage
of
it
to
nearby
producers
and
it
cast
on
other
producers
who
regularly
supply
the
market
a
larger
share
of
the
burden
of
surplus.
now,
the
secretary
has
also
admitted
that
nearby
milk
has
no
inherent
value
that
should
be
compensated
for
by
nearby
producers.
in
his
new
york
decision,
all
of
these
particular
factors
where
raised
in
apparent
justification
for
this
differential.
he
rejected
all
of
them.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
inherent
value
of
nearby
milk.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
its
availability
or
its
accessibility.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
so-called
increased
production
cost.
he
rejected
everything
except
the
fact
that
he
thought
they
should
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
historical
use
of
their
milk.
and
of
course,
this
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
act.
now
also
in
hood,
in
the
hood
case
decided
on
the
very
same
day
that
the
rock
royal
case
was
decided.
this
court
also
stated
in
that
case
that
the
producers,
the
intervene
in
that
case
where
not
entitled
to
maintain
a
historically
price
under
this
particular
act.
the
lower
court
had
stated
that
the
only
right
to
a
historical
price
higher
price
that
producer's
head
depended
upon
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
act
and
that
they
were
entitled
only
to
a
blend
price
or
to
the
uniform
price.
and
we
feel
that
the
hood
case
is
a
direct
authority
for
our
position
here
that
historical
prices
are
not
the
criterion
for
insertion
into
a
milk
order
that
the
criterion
is
uniform
prices
rather
than
varying
historical
prices.
now,
the
petitioners
have
also
indicated
that
there
some
question
as
to
the
record
in
this
case.
actually,
the
case
in
the
new
york-new
jersey
milk
order
was
also
heard
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
i
don't
know
of
any
milk
case
that
hasn't
been
heard
on
excerpts
from
the
record.
now,
when
they
say
excerpts
from
the
record,
they
imply
that
there
some
deficiency
here,
but
there
is
no
deficiency
in
the
blair
case.
there
was
a
15,000-page
record
with
hundreds
of
exhibits.
it
was
necessary
to
excerpt
a
relevant
material
in
order
that
the
court
could
actually
comprehend
the
problem.
the
same
thing
occurred
in
this
case
and
every
page
of
the
administrative
record
that
was
pertinent
to
the
issue
was
before
the
district
court.
and
the
nearby
producers,
although
they
presently
say
that
they
were
denied
intervention
in
the
district
court.
they
were
accorded
every
opportunity
to
present
whatever
argument
that
they
might
desired
to
in
that
case
in
the
district
court.
they
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
through
the
state
of
or
rather
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
that
case.
and
the
district
court
had
every
conceivable
argument
that
could
be
made
before
when
it
ruled
that
this
particular
provision
was
beyond
the
statutory
power
of
the
secretary.
now,
we
also
contend
that
this
is
not
only
discriminatory
as
well
as
beyond
the
statutory
power
of
the
secretary,
but
that
it
constitutes
a
trade
barrier.
in
other
words,
the
fact
for
instance
in
the
connecticut
order
illustrates
this
very
graphically
where
you
only
have
89
or
to
95
dairy
farmers
that
are
able
to
market
their
milk
on
a
regular
basis
in
that
particular
order.
now,
they
have
to
pay
a
large
share
of
there
milk
price,
even
though
it
benefits
the
nearby
producer
by
only
2
cents
per
carton,
cart
hundred
pounds.
and
the
inconceivable
to
contend
that
this
was
meant
to
reward
nearby
producers,
2
cents
per
hundredweight
rather
than
to
penalize
distant
producers
and
to
keep
distant
producers
out
of
this
particular
market
or
any
market
that
has
this
particular
penalty
provision.
now,
if
this
particular
differential
was
legalized
and
it
spread
to
other
markets,
one
can
readily
visualize
that
it
would
simply
create
chaos
and
disorderly
marketing.
in
fact
the
very
reason
that
this
particular
milk
order
that
consolidated
order
came
about
was
because
of
the
different
and
varying
conditions
that
these
differentials
participated,
that
they
actually
commanded
to
which
market
the
milk
would
go.
it
was
very
uneconomical
and
very
unrealistic
because
the
farmer
wanted
his
milk
to
go
the
market
where
he
would
get
this
differential
rather
than
have
it
go
to
a
market
where
it
could
be
distributed
most
economically
for
the
benefit
of
the
consumer
in
all
dairy
farmers.
so,
we
contend
that
is
a
much
more
discriminatory
and
vicious
differential
then
was
look
and
validated
in
the
blair
case.
in
the
blair
case,
we
had
a
differential
where
when
the
fluid
milk
in
the
market
reach
80%
total.
this
particular
differential
would
actually
seize
to
exist.
in
this
particular
differential,
it
would
have
to
reach
100%
before
it
would
seize
to
exist.
in
other
words,
the
differential
provides
that
is
46
cents
or
such
lesser
amount
as
will
equal
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price.
this
means
that
when
surplus
and
the
market
is
the
greatest,
the
differential
is
the
greatest.
and
the
nearby
producer
can
actually
increase
his
production
and
contribute
to
this
surplus
without
worrying
that
his
is
going
to
sustain
a
reduction
in
this
differential.
on
the
other
hand,
the
distant
producer,
he,
when
he
increases
his
production
actually
increases
the
amount
that
he
pays
under
this
protector
of
differential.
so
actually,
it
provides
protection
to
the
nearby
producer
and
at
the
same
time
it
injures
the
distant
producer
when
he
needs
this
protection
the
most.
now,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
possible
basis
that
has
been
set
forth
here
for
remand.
the
court
has
fully
considered
all
of
the
factors
involved
in
this
case.
and
we
would
also
like
to
mention
that
the
producer
association
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
hollman,
the
new
england
milk
producers
association,
does
vote
for
the
farmers
on
whether
a
milk
order
as
a
whole
should
be
approved.
but
no
dairy
farmer
has
the
right
to
vote
on
this
particular
provision
of
the
order.
now,
this
is
very
crucial
when
you
realize
that
the
new
england
milk
producers
association
which
is
boston
base
actually
attempted
to
intervene
in
the
suit
as
a
defendant
without
advising
any
of
their
membership
of
this.
and
it's
a
matter
of
record
that
its
counsel
fails
to
consult
its
membership
whenever
he
proposes
vary
administrative
provision
that
will
effect
their
very
livelihood.
and
we
contend
that
that
any
attempt
that
remand
here
would
actually
simply
cause
the
respondents
to
have
the
attorneys
for
the
nearby
producers
represent
them
because
the
nempa
is
actually
controlled
by
nearby
producer's
representatives.
now,
they
have
a
much
larger
proportion
of
their
membership
in
the
distant
areas.
but
in
the
particular
dairy
field
that
we're
examining
here
today,
dairy
farmers
did
not
take
that
much
interest.
i
shouldn't
say
interest,
but
they're
unable
to
effectuate
changes
in
these
dairy
organizations
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
particularly
when
they
are
not
advice
as
to
what
this
actually
going
on.
so,
if
under
any
question
of
remand
or
any
vote
here,
we
would
find
that
the
new
england
new
england
milk
producers
association
would
vote
for
the
great
majority
or
the
plaintiffs
that
have
brought
this
action
and
that
the
attorneys
for
the
new
england
milk
producers
associations
is
mr.
hollman
his
associate
counsel
below.
now,
we
also
feel
that
the
congress
specifically
intended
to
prevent
this
type
of
thing
because
there's
another
type
of
pooling
other
than
market
wide
pooling
which
is
called
individual
handler
pooling.
under
this
particular
provision,
alternative
provision
of
the
act,
all
dairy
farmers
serving
the
same
handler
have
to
be
also
paid
a
uniform
price,
but
the
price
does
vary
amongst
handlers.
now,
this
particular
type
of
pooling
individual
handler
pooling
is
only
appropriate
in
a
market
where
the
supplies
are
very
short
and
where
there
is
practical
uniformity
amongst
all
handlers.
and
this
type
of
pooling
has
been
found
to
be
totally
inappropriate
for
this
particular
market.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
in
order
to
institute
that
type
of
pooling,
the
congress
has
provided
that
every
producer
should
have
one
vote
on
that
particular
issue
alone
in
a
separate
referendum
on
that
one
issue.
and
this,
in
our
mind
indicates
that
the
congress
was
concern
that
the
associations
could
sometimes
vote
hand
different
things
that
would
affect
their
membership
if
they
fail
to
consult
with
them
and
the
congress
wanted
to
preclude
this
type
of
happening.
also,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
respect
to
summary
judgment
that
the
lehigh
valley
case
was
heard
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
new
york
currency
producers
versus
wickard
case
was
heard
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
here
propose
in
january,
shortly
after
the
institution
of
this
suit
that
the
case
be
heard
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
now
subsequently,
they
withdrew
that
particular
proposal,
but
nevertheless,
they
were
desirers
of
disposing
of
the
suit
at
that
time
and
nothing
was
brought
up
in
the
district
court
that
would
in
anyway
reflect
on
the
propriety
of
the
granting
of
summary
judgment.
the
record
was
very
voluminous
five
large
files
in
the
administrative
record
numbered
many
hundreds
of
pages
as
illustrated
by
the
753-page
appendix
here
before
this
court.
so,
every
facet
of
this
particular
differential
was
considered
and
also
the
act
requires
that
the
secretary
institute
only
differential
that
had
been
customarily
applied
by
handlers.
now,
the
record,
the
administrative
record
reflects
that
this
differential
had
never
been
applied
by
handlers,
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
petitioners
advert
to
the
contracts
of
various
cooperatives.
none
of
these
being
in
a
matter
of
record
and
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
that
i
know
of,
there's
no
document
dairy
evidence
whatsoever
to
this
effect.
the
fact
is
that
the
records
choose
conclusively
that
this
particular
differential
did
not
exist
until
august
1,
1937
in
the
boston
order.
it
could
not
have
been
legalized
or
validated
by
the
congress
because
of
the
fact
that
the
1937
reenactment
occurred
on
june
3,
1937.
of
this
particular
differential
was
instituted
subsequent
to
that
time.
so,
there's
no
actual
question
of
reenactment
even
involved
this
case.
also,
they
alleged
that
similar
differentials
existed
prior
the
1937
however.
but
actually,
this
is
not
the
case
because
the
similar
differentials
actually
number
one,
required
delivery
of
the
milk
to
the
city
market
and
the
nearby
differential
does
not.
so,
we
have
that
distinguishment
here
between
the
pre
1937
and
the
post
1937
differential.
also,
the
similar
differentials
that
they're
referring
to
is
actually
what
is
known
under
the
act
base
rating.
base
rating
requires
that
all
dairy
farmers
receive
the
same
fluid
or
class
i
milk
price
for
their
base
milk.
but
under
the
1936
order,
only
the
nearby
producer
received
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price
for
his
base
milk.
many
producers
were
never
even
assigned
a
base
and
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
it
means
this
that
they
compute
the
demand,
the
normal
demands
of
the
market
and
they
divide
up
the
market,
the
fluid
milk
market
and
assign
each
producer
a
base.
and
the
base
is
a
quota
that
he
supposed
to
produce.
for
that
particular
quota,
he
will
received
the
fluid
milk
for
class
i
milk
price.
anything
he
produces
in
excess
of
that,
he
will
receive
the
manufactured
or
surplus
price.
now,
he
is
free
to
produce
as
much
milk
as
he
likes,
but
any
milk
produce
in
excess
of
his
base
is
paid
for
at
the
surplus
price.
under
the
act
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
in
1965
in
the
food
and
agriculture
act,
all
producers
are
entitled
to
received
that
fluid
or
class
i
price
for
their
base
milk.
you
cannot
give
it
that
price
to
the
nearby
producers
and
the
rest
of
the
surplus
to
the
distant
producers
and
this
is
what
is
referred
to
a
similar
differentials
by
the
petitioners
here.
actually,
this
is
an
admission
of
the
illegality
of
the
so-called
similar
differentials
because
of
the
very
fact
that
they
are
related
to
use
and
constitute
a
violation
of
the
base
rating
plans
of
the
act.
now,
they
have
mentioned
the
case
of
the
green
valley
creamery
from
the
first
circuit
has
been
authority
for
the
promulgation
of
this
particular
nearby
differential
as
a
market
differential.
we
just
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
green
valley
case,
there
were
no
producers
before
the
court.
that
was
a
handler
case
for
enforcement
and
involved
entirely
different
issue.
moreover,
the
court
there
did
not
even
examine
this
issue
for
the
very
reason
that
it
was
not
properly
before
the
court.
this
was
the
contention
of
the
government
that
handlers
could
not
question
disbursements
from
out
of
the
pool
and
that
therefore,
when
the
handlers
attempted
to
raise
this
argument
concerning
the
nearby
differential,
the
government's
argument
was
accepted
that
this
particular
contention
or
issue
could
not
be
raise
by
handlers.
so,
we
have
the
government
contending
that
they
have
relied
on
the
green
valley
decision
when
that
court
actually
accepted
its
argument
for
that
particular
issue
concerning
the
legality
of
a
nearby
differential
was
not
even
before
the
court.
also
the
green
valley
court
actually
fail
to
realize
that
the
market
differential
which
it
said
was
a
valid
differential
on
which
we
agree
was
already
in
the
order.
it
confused
the
market
differential
with
the
nearby
differential.
the
court
and
green
valley
thought
that
there
was
a
benefit
in
a
service
provided
when
milk
was
delivered
to
the
city
market
and
it
stated
that
it
was
of
the
impression
that
nearby
producers
did
deliver
their
milk
to
the
city
market.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
what
this
is
a
compensable
service
or
value.
but
this
was
already
in
the
order
and
a
reading
of
the
green
valley
case
will
illustrate
that
that
court
did
not
realize
that
this
particular
differential
was
already
in
the
order
and
the
producers
were
compensated
for
delivering
their
milk
to
the
city
market.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
when
the
regulation
was
first
instituted
in
the
boston
milk
market,
there
were
a
small
number
of
producers
nearby
the
market
who
formed
an
association
known
as
a
nearby
producers
association.
although,
it
was
beyond
any
contradiction
that
all
producers
where
receiving
low
prices
for
their
milk
at
that
time,
they
contended
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
special
price
that
they
were
not
subject
to
equalization
as
required
by
the
act
and
they
threatened
to
become
an
menace
to
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
at
that
time
the
act
in
this
program
was
in
a
very
fledgling
state
and
they
needed
the
enforcement
support
of
the
state
of
massachusetts.
the
state
of
massachusetts
refuse
to
give
this
enforcement
support
unless
this
particular
concession
was
made
to
its
producers.
and
they
were
other
view
the
distant
producers
and
the
government
at
that
time
that
this
was
a
temporary
concession.
but
like
all
concessions
once
their
made,
it's
very
difficult
to
have
the
individual
set
or
receiving
the
particular
benefit
give
it
up.
in
fact
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
your
honor.
not
to
my
knowledge.
in
fact,
it's
not
in
the
act,
it's
not
in
report
send,
it's
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
state
claim
that
they
were
not
required
that
they
could
not
be
required
to
equalize
their
milk
production
with
other
dairy
farmers.
and
in
order
to
gain
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
in
other
words,
come
in
to
the
blend
price
and
this
was
in
effect,
a
temporary
acknowledgement
or
concession
to
them,
in
order
to
gain
the
enforcement
support
of
the
massachusetts
milk
control
board.
this
was
found
by
the
lower
court
to
be
a
fact
also.
in
order
words,
the
case
of
whiting
milk
company,
united
states
versus
whiting
milk
company
in
the
boston
market
in
the
30's
found
that
is
little
as
2,000
quarts
of
milk
or
one
tank
load
of
milk
introduce
in
the
boston
market,
not
subject
to
regulation
or
control
could
affect
the
entire
price
of
all
dairy
farmers.
consequently,
you
had
to
have
control
of
the
interstate
milk
and
unless
the
local
authorities
would
enforce
that
control
why
you
had
no
way
of
actually
controlling
the
milk
market
price
of
all
the
dairy
farmers.
so,
this
was
a
temporary
concession
in
that
respect,
although,
it
was
recognized
that
it
was
a
deviation
from
the
requirements
of
the
act.
now,
as
i
indicated
has
grown
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
introduce
during
1935
hearing,
1936
hearings
was
the
testimony
of
one
individual
who
referred
to
the
alleged
milk
price
receive
by
one
dairy
farmer
out
of
about
20,000
that
were
supplying
the
market.
and
even
that
price
to
one
dairy
farmer
was
admittedly
subject
to
correction.
the
only
other
evidence
that
was
introduce
that
would
purport
to
justify
this
was
the
prices
paid
by
two
handlers,
smaller
handlers
out
of
hundreds
that
were
operating
in
that
particular
market.
so
there
actually
wasn't
any
real
evidential
basis
for
the
awarding
to
this
differential,
and
this
is
all
brought
out
in
the
record.
these
hearings,
the
pertinent
parts
of
them
are
in
the
appendix.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no.
not
at
that
time
because
of
the
fact
that
all
farmers
receiving
low
prices
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
vermont
is
trying
to
address
the
last
five
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
mr.
justice
black
and
members
of
the
court.
first,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations.
this
particular
differential
has
no
relationship
at
all
to
any
40-mile
zone
from
any
principal
consumption
center
or
the
city
of
boston
or
any
other
city.
that
was
true
of
the
1937
greater
boston
order.
but
at
the
present
time
under
the
consolidated
orders,
all
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
connecticut
and
all
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
massachusetts
other
than
one
county
are
all
classified
as
nearby
producers.
initially,
the
under
the
greater
boston
market
order,
there
were
over
7,400
distant
producers
serving
that
market.
they
supplied
approximately
92%
of
the
milk.
at
that
time,
there
were
672
nearby
producers.
and
at
the
present
time
as
the
petitioners
have
indicated,
there
are
over
2,000
approximately
2,200
nearby
producers.
short
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
approximately
one
third.
the
significance
--
the
significance
of
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
is
this.
that
under
the
boston
order,
the
distant
producers,
so-called
distant
producers
only
paid
under
this
nearby
differential.
two
to
three
cents
per
hundredweight,
they
did
not
have
to
pay
the
46
cents
simply
for
the
reason
if
they
were
so
many
distant
producers.
as
their
numbers
have
been
cut
and
as
the
nearby
producers
have
increased
in
number,
the
differential
that
is
deducted
from
their
milk
price
has
grown.
initially,
it
was
a
factor
that
was
regarded
as
admittedly
illegal,
but
that
they
could
afford
to
wink
at
it
so
to
speak,
in
order
to
get
the
benefits
of
federal
regulation.
but
at
the
present
time
it
has
grown
like
the
proverbial
topsy
and
it
has
a
resulted
in
its
incorporation
and
to
other
others
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
existed
in
the
boston
order.
now
on
that
connection,
i
think
its
important
to
realize
that
this
particular
differential
exist
in
only
one
other
milk
order
in
the
united
states
out
of
approximate
75
federal
milk
marketing
orders.
that
fact
conclusively
indicates
that
is
not
a
vital
provision.
it's
not
a
necessary
provision.
the
only
effect
that
it
has
is
to
discriminate
against
the
marketings
of
distant
producers.
the
only
other
milk
order
which
contain
is
particular
differential
is
a
connecticut
federal
milk
marketing
order.
and
that
illustrates
very
graphically
the
injury
that
a
differential
provision
of
this
type
can
effect
upon
distant
producers.
under
the
connecticut
milk
order,
there
are
only
89
to
95
dairy
farmers
that
are
characterized
as
distant
or
non-nearby
dairy
farmers.
there
are
approximately
2,000
that
are
characterized
as
nearby
dairy
farmers.
all
of
your
dairy
farmers
within
the
state
of
connecticut
are
termed
nearby
dairy
farmers
even
though
at
least
50%
of
the
milk
for
that
market
is
supplied
by
out
of
state
dairy
farmers.
now,
the
result
is
under
the
computation
in
that
exactly
reverse
situation
that
the
distant
dairy
farmers
marketing
under
that
order
have
to
pay
44
cents
for
every
hundred
pounds
of
milk
of
their
needed
milk
that
they
regularly
market
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
how
this
is
benefit
the
connecticut
nearby
producer?
it
increases
his
price
not
by
46
cents
but
by
2
cents
per
hundredweight.
that
is
simply
a
trivital
to
the
fact
that
there
are
not
enough
distant
producers
to
pay
this
differential.
the
distant
producers
under
that
order
loose
from
$5,000.00
to
$6,000.00
a
year
in
order
to
benefit
the
nearby
producer
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$12.50
a
month.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
in
this
case,
no
your
honor.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
i'm
talking
about
how
that
it
exist
and
only
one
other
order
out
about
75
in
the
countries
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
that
order
incidentally
is
functioning
much
better
than
it
ever
has
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
dairy
farmers
are
able
to
cooperate
and
act
in
harmony.
instead
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
one
reason
why
i
brought
in
the
connecticut
order.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
it
is
very
confusing.
the
distant
farmer
in
vermont,
take
for
example,
if
he
wants
to
market
his
milk,
his
needed
milk,
although,
he
is
supplied
boston,
say
for
instance
for
over
30
years.
he
has
to
pay
this
differential
to
nearby
producers
located
in
the
states
of
connecticut
and
massachusetts
and
rhode
island.
rhode
island
is
a
very
small
factor.
they
produce
only
about
1%
of
the
milk
for
the
market
and
are
not
significant
factor
in
the
case.
however,
if
the
vermont
producer
or
the
main
producer
of
the
new
hampshire
producer
wants
to
market
his
needed
milk
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
he
also
has
to
pay
the
same
differential.
only
this
time
in
a
much
larger
amount.
by
the
same
token,
the
connecticut
producer
collects
both
ways.
he
and
the
rhode
island
producer
does
also.
he
is
entitled
to
this
differential
irrespective
of
what
market
his
milk
goes
to.
so,
it's
not
simply
a
question
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
that
is
in
respect
to
the
order
that
presently
considering.
yes.
in
respect
to
the
connecticut
order,
it
does
encompass
the
entire
state,
and
in
both
orders
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct
and
those
are
the
only
two
milk
orders
in
united
states
that
have
this
particular
provision.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
and
in
fact,
it's
my
contention
and
i
think
this
would
be
substantiated
that
most
nearby
dairy
farmers
are
not
desirers
of
exacting
this
penalty
payment
from
their
fellow
dairy
farmers.
it's
not
necessary
in
any
other
area
of
the
country.
in
this
particular
differential
like
all
others
of
its
type
has
been
brought
about
really
through
the
inconsistence
of
a
very
limited
group
and
it's
been
perpetuated
in
the
same
manner.
now
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
under
our
view.
the
case
except
for
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
shortly
after
the
consolidation
of
these
orders
in
which
the
boston,
southeastern
new
england,
the
worcester
and
the
springfield
orders
were
consolidated
previously.
those
nearby
producers
could
only
obtain
this
particular
differential
by
delivering
to
that
particular
market
that
they
were
associated
with.
after
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
we
represent
by
a
class
action
order
that
was
contested
in
the
district
court.
we
represent
the
distant
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
approximately
6,500
dairy
farmers
and
after
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
not
at
less
than
it
cost
to
produce,
no.
however
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
is
my
understanding.
however,
i
will
say
this
that
the
margin
of
profit
is
something
that
very
amongst
different
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
it
does
affect
some
more
than
it
does
others.
for
instance,
when
this
order
consolidated
in
1964
so
that
a
producer
did
no
have
to
have
any
historical
association
with
any
particular
market.
he
could
receive
the
nearby
producer
could
receive
this
differential
irrespective
aware
his
milk
was
delivered.
then,
we
find
that
approximately
one
year,
within
one
year,
at
least
1,000
distant
dairy
farmers
were
forced
out
of
business
by
this
particular
differential.
now,
we
do
make
that
claim
and
we
think
it's
substantiated.
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
what
we
regard
the
congressional
program
to
be
here.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
i
was
coming
to
that
in
period
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
it
represents
the
view
the
secretary
of
agriculture
only
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
included
in
these
two
orders
out
of
about
75
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
his
actual
finding
in
1964
was
that
the
differential
was
not
resulting
in
such
disorderly
conditions
as
with
warrant,
its
deletion
at
this
time.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
proper
finding.
number
one
under
the
act,
he
is
definitely
obligated
to
find
that
not
only
the
order
but
the
every
provision
of
the
order
will
tend
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act.
and
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
what
i'm
saying
there
is
that
he
also
fail
to
make
the
proper
finding
even
assuming
that
he
have
this
power.
but
we
are
saying
that
he
definitely
does
not
have
this
power
that
a
more
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
that
a
more
basic
violation
of
the
act
could
not
be
comprehended.
it's
our
contention
that
initially
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
was
passed
for
the
simple
reason
that
all
dairy
farmers
were
receiving
very
low
prices
for
the
milk.
the
fact
that
some
dairy
farmers
have
received
higher
prices
than
others
in
the
1920's
has
no
real
relevancy
here.
the
fact
is
that
the
private
sector
of
the
milk
industry
that
cooperatives
and
so
forth,
there
were
varying
prices
that
actually
contributed
to
the
market
instability
here
and
it
resulted
eventually
in
all
producers
receiving
low
prices
for
their
milk,
below
the
cost
the
production
actually
in
the
1929
to
'33
period.
and
consequently
because
of
the
fact
that
a
state
as
this
court
held
in
bowman
versus
ceiling
could
not
regulate
the
price
of
milk
that
moved
across
interstate
borders,
the
congress
was
force
to
meet
this
problem
by
the
enactment
of
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
of
1933.
that
provided
primarily
for
solving
the
problem
through
marketing
agreements
and
supplementing
licenses.
but
the
licenses
and
the
marketing
agreements
were
at
that
time
relegated
solely
to
the
prevention
of
unfair
trade
practices
and
the
act
was
very
vague
and
nebulous.
as
a
result,
many
different
features
were
included
within
these
licenses
that
were
doubtful
legality
and
definitely
against
public
policy.
as
a
result,
the
handlers
actually
refuse
to
comply
with
the
different
provisions
of
these
licenses
as
did
the
producers
and
this
compounded
the
situation,
in
fact
that
congress
was
well
aware
from
different
reports
from
the
federal
trade
commission
that
the
situation
was
such
that
the
act
would
have
to
be
amended
if
it
was
to
be
made
workable.
and
in
1935,
they
so
amend
the
act
so
extensively
that
is
referred
to
as
the
1935
act
which
is
the
court
has
also
characterized
it
as
such
some
of
its
decisions
of
that
particular
1935
act
get
away
with
the
licenses
and
included
a
provision
whereby
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
issue
milk
marketing
orders.
but
the
congress
was
very
definite
and
stating
that
these
orders
could
contain
the
enumerated
terms
and
conditions
and
no
others.
the
secretary
of
course
has
discretion
concerning
which
terms
to
include
in
this
particular
others.
but
he
of
course,
cannot
amend
the
act
or
reappeal
by
including
within
it
various
provisions
without
any
statutory
basis.
and
as
the
petitioners
have
indicated
the
primary
problem
involved
here
in
the
milk
industry
is
not
only
that
milk
is
highly
perishable,
but
also
that
there
is
a
surplus
of
milk,
a
necessary
surplus
even
in
a
short
production
season
of
the
year
approximately
20%.
this,
of
course
results
in
a
much
larger
surplus
during
the
flash
production
season
of
the
year
and
this
is
unnecessary
surplus
and
in
a
secretary
has
found
as
recently
as
1957
that
without
regulation.
we
find
that
the
level
of
prices
to
all
producers
would
be
below
the
cost
of
production.
regulation
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
there
are,
although
the
demand
for
milk
is
fairly
constant,
there
are
daily
fluctuations.
for
instance,
during
the
summer
months,
you
have
various
areas
that
the
countries
that
are
resort
areas
for
instance
that
have
an
influx
of
population
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
well,
not
always.
there's
different
--
you
have
in
vermont
for
instance,
the
skiing
dairy
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes
we
do.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
this
is
in
the
right
period.
yes.
there's
no
dispute
as
to
this.
this
is
in
the
record
that
you
have
to
maintain
the
necessary
reserved
in
order
to
protect
the
consumer
by
an
adequate
milk
supply.
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
respondents
here
that
the
congress
was
motivated
to
solve
this
problem
by
apportioning
the
burdens
of
surplus
along
with
the
benefits
of
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price
through
the
issuance
of
a
program
that
call
for
a
uniform
price
to
all
dairy
farmers,
irrespective
of
the
use
of
their
particular
milk.
now,
of
course,
this
was
the
big
problem
that
some
dealers
had
a
fluid
milk
outlet
for
their
milk.
producers
that
were
selling
to
that
particular
handler
or
dealer
where
sometimes
able
to
obtain
a
higher
price
than
other
dairy
farmers
and
other
handlers
serving
another
handler
who
was
able
not
to
sell
in
the
fluid
milk
market.
and
although
the
petitioners
here
cite
the
case
of
rock
royal
is
authority
for
this
differential,
we
contend
that
it
was
--
is
clearly
just
the
opposite
and
the
rock
royal
actually,
it
was
--
there
were
no
producers
before
the
court.
it
was
a
case
that
involves
solely
handlers
and
it
was
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
1937
act.
the
handlers
contended
that
it
violated
their
constitutional
rights
to
require
them
to
pay
a
part
of
the
monies
that
they
have
obtained
from
the
class
i
sales
into
the
market
wide
pool
or
producer
settlement
fund
in
order
that
these
monies
would
be
paid
over
to
other
handlers
who
have
low
fluid
sales.
most
of
their
milk
was
dispose
of
for
manufacturing
purposes,
but
it's
obvious
that
the
congressional
plan
couldn't
work
unless
there
was
a
provision
of
this
nature
and
also
that
congress
did
not
provide
for
any
great
unusual
situation
here.
they
provided
for
minimum
milk
prices
that
the
handler
was
obligated
to
pay
for
milk.
now,
the
court
in
rock
royal
held
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
due
process
or
the
taking
of
the
handler's
property
to
require
him
to
pay
the
excess
of
his
fluid
sales
over
the
market
wide
average
into
the
producer
settlement
fund
for
distribution
to
other
handlers
who
in
turn
would
pay
these
monies
to
their
own
producers.
now,
its
very
evident
that
if
a
handler
could
not
retain
these
monies
over
the
market
wide
blend
price
and
pay
them
into
his
own
producer
and
was
obligated
to
pay
this
into
the
fund
that
a
dairy
farmers
that
server
that
particular
handler
certainly
couldn't
make
the
same
claim
that
this
could
be
accomplish
indirectly
through
a
nearby
differential.
now,
we
contend
that
the
words
irrespective
of
use
simply
mean
that
a
dairy
farmer
is
entitle
to
the
payment
of
the
uniform
price
irrespective
of
the
use
of
his
milk
and
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
milk
appeal,
they
have
indicated
that
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
language.
now,
the
contentions
of
the
petitioners
would
actually
nullify
the
act,
if
they
were
to
delete
that
language
and
simply
say
that
this
means
that
you
can
pay
a
dairy
farm
around
the
basis
of
use
of
his
milk.
this
is
clearly
just
the
opposite
of
what
the
congress
contended
should
be
done.
now,
the
petitioners
acknowledge
that
in
the
blair
case
that
the
adjustments
to
the
uniform
price
in
that
case
involved
a
location
differential.
location
differential
really
is
nothing
more
than
a
differential
that
is
allowed
for
the
transportation
element
that
enters
into
the
price
of
milk.
milk
that
is
delivered
to
one
part
of
the
milk
shed
naturally
is
has
to
be
delivered
to
the
primary
consumption
center.
these
are
the
large
cities
and
the
dairy
farmer
does
have
to
pay
for
those
transportation
cost.
we
make
no
objection
in
that
regard
even
though
that
does
detract
from
our
milk
price.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
in
our
brief,
we
have
outlined
the
report
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
in
great
detail
and
if
quotes
the
language
of
the
reports
where
the
report
does
say
that
that
location
differential
is
for
transportation
purposes
from
the
place,
from
the
plant
where
the
milk
is
delivered
to
the
principal
consumption
center.
and
you
have
to
have
the
system
whereby
you
set
up
zones
and
fix
a
particular
transportation
charge
for
each
zone
as
related
to
the
principal
consumption
center
because
this
is
the
where
the
milk
is
going,
this
is
where
its
produced.
and
of
course,
the
court
in
blair
held
that
this
was
not
a
proper
differential
to
justify
the
one
that
was
in
the
new
york
order
in
which
was
very
similar
to
the
one
that
is
in
this
order
that
that
related
strictly
to
transportation.
now,
if
the
petitioners
--
i
don't
understand
whether
they
currently
maintain
that
that
is
a
proper
differential
that
would
support
the
location
differential
that
would
support
the
nearby
differential
involve
in
this
case.
but
they
seem
to
be
limiting
their
argument
at
the
present
time
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
market
differential.
now,
the
reports
clearly
state
that
a
market
differential
is
a
differential
that
is
paid
to
a
dairy
farmer
for
delivering
his
milk
to
a
city
market
rather
than
to
a
country
plant
because
in
a
country
plant,
there
are
double
handling
cost
involved.
and
the
measure
of
this
particular
market
differential
is
normally
the
difference
between
the
receiving
cost
that
the
country
plant
and
that
at
the
city
plant.
and
the
dairy
farmers
pay
that
particular
differential
because
he
actually
performs
a
service
there
and
he
accomplishes
a
reduction
and
the
cost
of
the
handler
that
maintains
the
various
country
plants.
now
the
congress,
if
the
reports
are
examined
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
show
that
they
gave
great
consideration
to
this
particular
1935
act
because
of
the
reason
schechter
case
and
the
recent
case
of
panama
versus
ryan,
the
other
particular
case
that
dealt
with
delegation
of
powers.
it
was
very
careful
to
spell
out
in
complete
detail
what
provision
the
secretary
could
include
in
this
milk
orders.
and
we
contend
that
there's
a
no
possible
basis
for
saying
that
there's
any
statutory
justification
for
the
nearby
differential
when
that
particular
differential
is
not
even
mention
either
in
the
act
or
in
any
of
the
reports.
now,
the
act
provides
for
a
volume
market
and
production
differentials
and
our
understanding
of
the
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
the
market
differential
is
simply
illustrative
in
nature.
now
if
this
was
true,
there'd
be
no
point
in
the
congress
specifying
the
volume
differential,
the
production
differential,
the
butter
fat
differential,
the
quality
differential,
the
location
differential.
they
could
simply
have
set
all
customary
market
differentials,
if
this
was
what
they
meant
by
market
differential.
but
it
was
not
and
this
is
clearly
reflected
in
the
reports.
incidentally,
the
nearby
producer
can
deliver
his
milk
to
a
country
plant
and
still
receive
this
nearby
differential.
whereas
the
distant
producer
can
deliver
his
milk
right
to
the
market
center
and
he
does
not
receive
this
differential.
and
in
fact
he
has
to
pay
the
nearby
producer
this
particular
differential
out
of
his
milk
price.
so,
it's
just
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
congress
has
defined
the
market
differential
to
be;
one
for
delivery
to
the
city
market.
also,
the
only
exception
to
the
uniform
price
that
is
authorized
by
the
act
is
one
which
is
provided
for
in
section
8c
(5)
(b)
pertaining
to
new
producers.
the
congress
was
concern
that
handlers
were
bringing
milk
into
various
markets
and
beating
down
local
prices
within
that
reach
of
market.
but
it
was
also
concerned
that
if
wanted
to
make
sure
that
new
producers
would
be
given
reasonable
opportunities
to
enter
markets.
in
other
words,
that
these
would
not
be
close
markets.
consequently,
provision
8c
(5)
(b)
provides
that
a
new
producer
is
to
conceive
the
same
price
as
any
other
producer
after
he
serves
a
particular
market
for
two
months.
now,
the
two
months
probationary
period
is
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
he
is
going
to
regularly
supply
that
market.
during
that
period,
he
receives
the
lowest
price
use
classification
price.
during
that
particular
two
months
and
this
is
to
assure
that
he
will
not
market
his
milk
in
a
particular
region
only
when
it's
an
opportunity
time
for
him
to
do
so.
now,
under
the
particular
provision
8c
(5)
(b)
pertaining
to
new
producers
that
specifically
states
that
that
lowest
used
price
that
he
is
to
receive
during
those
two
months
is
subject
to
all
other
adjustments
authorize
under
the
act.
now
for
instance,
he
would
receive
the
butter
fat
differential
if
his
milk
wanted
it,
he
would
be
subject
to
the
transportation
differential.
he
would
be
subject
to
the
market
differential
for
direct
delivery
of
milk.
but
under
the
act
he
would
also,
if
this
nearby
differential
is
a
valid
differential,
he
would
also
be
subject
to
the
nearby
differential
and
this
would
result
in
a
new
producer
whom
the
act
requires
to
receive
the
lowest
possible
price
during
the
first
two
months
of
his
delivery
because
of
the
fact
that
he
is
never
supplied
this
market.
he
would
receive
a
differential
under
this
nearby
differential
provision
which
would
pay
him
because
of
the
fluid
use
his
milk
on
a
historical
basis,
even
though
he
had
never
supplied
the
market.
now,
this
is
a
double
link
consistency
that
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
congress.
this
is
an
inconsistency
that
is
particularly
applicable
only
to
the
secretary
and
even
if
he
didn't
pay
this
nearby
differential
to
these
new
producers,
this
simply
could
not
be
explain
the
way
by
a
second
violation
because
the
act
requires
that
all
of
the
adjustments
be
taken
into
account
even
in
respect
to
these
new
producers.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
he
has
not
given
a
reason
for
other
markets.
he
has
said
in
respect
to
massachusetts,
rhode
island
and
connecticut
producers
that
historically,
dairy
farmers
in
the
states
of
massachusetts,
rhode
island
and
connecticut
because
of
their
location
with
reference
to
the
large
population
concentrations
of
new
england
have
disposed
of
a
substantially
larger
percentage
of
their
production
for
fluid
use
than
have
dairy
farmers
in
the
up
country
area.
hence,
nearby
producers
have
been
able
to
realize
that
price
higher
in
relation
to
more
distant
producers
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
advantage
of
the
transportation
to
market.
under
market
wide
pooling
here
in
propose
and
without
some
adjustment
mechanism,
the
nearby
producer
notwithstanding
would
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
air
utilization
of
all
milk
in
the
milk
shed
rather
than
according
to
the
utilization
of
his
milk.
now,
this
is
a
direct
admission
of
a
violation
of
the
act
because
the
act
specifically
states
that
no
dairy
farmer
is
to
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
his
milk.
he
is
to
be
paid
a
uniform
price
irrespective
of
the
use
of
his
milk.
the
secretary
also
found
that
under
a
regulated
market,
the
nearby
producer
also
obtains
the
protection
of
the
federal
regulatory
program
and
receives
in
many
instances,
a
higher
price
and
he
would
otherwise
received.
so,
we
come
to
the
a
situation
where
prior
to
federal
regulation,
all
dairy
farmers
where
receiving
low
prices
and
even
prior
to
the
1964
act.
much
of
the
local
produced
milk
had
been
dispose
of
for
manufacturing
your
surplus
purposes
and
its
just
not
an
accuracy
to
say
that
nearby
producers
consistently
supply
the
fluid
milk
market.
in
fact
as
recently
as
1946,
the
secretary
had
to
amend
the
boston
order
because
of
the
fact
that
the
nearby
producers
where
supplying
milk
to
the
country
plants
and
were
receiving
actually
a
higher
price
than
what
they
were
entitled
to
at
those
particular
plants.
now,
we
also
feel
that
this
court's
specifically
stated
in
rock
royal
that
any
variants
between
uniform
prices
would
result
in
a
discrimination
and
would
actually
cause
certain
producers
to
bear
an
unfair
burden
of
the
surplus
market.
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
nearby
differential
does.
it
reserves
the
fluid
milk
market
or
a
larger
percentage
of
it
to
nearby
producers
and
it
cast
on
other
producers
who
regularly
supply
the
market
a
larger
share
of
the
burden
of
surplus.
now,
the
secretary
has
also
admitted
that
nearby
milk
has
no
inherent
value
that
should
be
compensated
for
by
nearby
producers.
in
his
new
york
decision,
all
of
these
particular
factors
where
raised
in
apparent
justification
for
this
differential.
he
rejected
all
of
them.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
inherent
value
of
nearby
milk.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
its
availability
or
its
accessibility.
he
rejected
the
factor
of
so-called
increased
production
cost.
he
rejected
everything
except
the
fact
that
he
thought
they
should
be
paid
on
the
basis
of
the
historical
use
of
their
milk.
and
of
course,
this
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
act.
now
also
in
hood,
in
the
hood
case
decided
on
the
very
same
day
that
the
rock
royal
case
was
decided.
this
court
also
stated
in
that
case
that
the
producers,
the
intervene
in
that
case
where
not
entitled
to
maintain
a
historically
price
under
this
particular
act.
the
lower
court
had
stated
that
the
only
right
to
a
historical
price
higher
price
that
producer's
head
depended
upon
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
act
and
that
they
were
entitled
only
to
a
blend
price
or
to
the
uniform
price.
and
we
feel
that
the
hood
case
is
a
direct
authority
for
our
position
here
that
historical
prices
are
not
the
criterion
for
insertion
into
a
milk
order
that
the
criterion
is
uniform
prices
rather
than
varying
historical
prices.
now,
the
petitioners
have
also
indicated
that
there
some
question
as
to
the
record
in
this
case.
actually,
the
case
in
the
new
york-new
jersey
milk
order
was
also
heard
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
i
don't
know
of
any
milk
case
that
hasn't
been
heard
on
excerpts
from
the
record.
now,
when
they
say
excerpts
from
the
record,
they
imply
that
there
some
deficiency
here,
but
there
is
no
deficiency
in
the
blair
case.
there
was
a
15,000-page
record
with
hundreds
of
exhibits.
it
was
necessary
to
excerpt
a
relevant
material
in
order
that
the
court
could
actually
comprehend
the
problem.
the
same
thing
occurred
in
this
case
and
every
page
of
the
administrative
record
that
was
pertinent
to
the
issue
was
before
the
district
court.
and
the
nearby
producers,
although
they
presently
say
that
they
were
denied
intervention
in
the
district
court.
they
were
accorded
every
opportunity
to
present
whatever
argument
that
they
might
desired
to
in
that
case
in
the
district
court.
they
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
through
the
state
of
or
rather
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
that
case.
and
the
district
court
had
every
conceivable
argument
that
could
be
made
before
when
it
ruled
that
this
particular
provision
was
beyond
the
statutory
power
of
the
secretary.
now,
we
also
contend
that
this
is
not
only
discriminatory
as
well
as
beyond
the
statutory
power
of
the
secretary,
but
that
it
constitutes
a
trade
barrier.
in
other
words,
the
fact
for
instance
in
the
connecticut
order
illustrates
this
very
graphically
where
you
only
have
89
or
to
95
dairy
farmers
that
are
able
to
market
their
milk
on
a
regular
basis
in
that
particular
order.
now,
they
have
to
pay
a
large
share
of
there
milk
price,
even
though
it
benefits
the
nearby
producer
by
only
2
cents
per
carton,
cart
hundred
pounds.
and
the
inconceivable
to
contend
that
this
was
meant
to
reward
nearby
producers,
2
cents
per
hundredweight
rather
than
to
penalize
distant
producers
and
to
keep
distant
producers
out
of
this
particular
market
or
any
market
that
has
this
particular
penalty
provision.
now,
if
this
particular
differential
was
legalized
and
it
spread
to
other
markets,
one
can
readily
visualize
that
it
would
simply
create
chaos
and
disorderly
marketing.
in
fact
the
very
reason
that
this
particular
milk
order
that
consolidated
order
came
about
was
because
of
the
different
and
varying
conditions
that
these
differentials
participated,
that
they
actually
commanded
to
which
market
the
milk
would
go.
it
was
very
uneconomical
and
very
unrealistic
because
the
farmer
wanted
his
milk
to
go
the
market
where
he
would
get
this
differential
rather
than
have
it
go
to
a
market
where
it
could
be
distributed
most
economically
for
the
benefit
of
the
consumer
in
all
dairy
farmers.
so,
we
contend
that
is
a
much
more
discriminatory
and
vicious
differential
then
was
look
and
validated
in
the
blair
case.
in
the
blair
case,
we
had
a
differential
where
when
the
fluid
milk
in
the
market
reach
80%
total.
this
particular
differential
would
actually
seize
to
exist.
in
this
particular
differential,
it
would
have
to
reach
100%
before
it
would
seize
to
exist.
in
other
words,
the
differential
provides
that
is
46
cents
or
such
lesser
amount
as
will
equal
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price.
this
means
that
when
surplus
and
the
market
is
the
greatest,
the
differential
is
the
greatest.
and
the
nearby
producer
can
actually
increase
his
production
and
contribute
to
this
surplus
without
worrying
that
his
is
going
to
sustain
a
reduction
in
this
differential.
on
the
other
hand,
the
distant
producer,
he,
when
he
increases
his
production
actually
increases
the
amount
that
he
pays
under
this
protector
of
differential.
so
actually,
it
provides
protection
to
the
nearby
producer
and
at
the
same
time
it
injures
the
distant
producer
when
he
needs
this
protection
the
most.
now,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
possible
basis
that
has
been
set
forth
here
for
remand.
the
court
has
fully
considered
all
of
the
factors
involved
in
this
case.
and
we
would
also
like
to
mention
that
the
producer
association
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
hollman,
the
new
england
milk
producers
association,
does
vote
for
the
farmers
on
whether
a
milk
order
as
a
whole
should
be
approved.
but
no
dairy
farmer
has
the
right
to
vote
on
this
particular
provision
of
the
order.
now,
this
is
very
crucial
when
you
realize
that
the
new
england
milk
producers
association
which
is
boston
base
actually
attempted
to
intervene
in
the
suit
as
a
defendant
without
advising
any
of
their
membership
of
this.
and
it's
a
matter
of
record
that
its
counsel
fails
to
consult
its
membership
whenever
he
proposes
vary
administrative
provision
that
will
effect
their
very
livelihood.
and
we
contend
that
that
any
attempt
that
remand
here
would
actually
simply
cause
the
respondents
to
have
the
attorneys
for
the
nearby
producers
represent
them
because
the
nempa
is
actually
controlled
by
nearby
producer's
representatives.
now,
they
have
a
much
larger
proportion
of
their
membership
in
the
distant
areas.
but
in
the
particular
dairy
field
that
we're
examining
here
today,
dairy
farmers
did
not
take
that
much
interest.
i
shouldn't
say
interest,
but
they're
unable
to
effectuate
changes
in
these
dairy
organizations
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
particularly
when
they
are
not
advice
as
to
what
this
actually
going
on.
so,
if
under
any
question
of
remand
or
any
vote
here,
we
would
find
that
the
new
england
new
england
milk
producers
association
would
vote
for
the
great
majority
or
the
plaintiffs
that
have
brought
this
action
and
that
the
attorneys
for
the
new
england
milk
producers
associations
is
mr.
hollman
his
associate
counsel
below.
now,
we
also
feel
that
the
congress
specifically
intended
to
prevent
this
type
of
thing
because
there's
another
type
of
pooling
other
than
market
wide
pooling
which
is
called
individual
handler
pooling.
under
this
particular
provision,
alternative
provision
of
the
act,
all
dairy
farmers
serving
the
same
handler
have
to
be
also
paid
a
uniform
price,
but
the
price
does
vary
amongst
handlers.
now,
this
particular
type
of
pooling
individual
handler
pooling
is
only
appropriate
in
a
market
where
the
supplies
are
very
short
and
where
there
is
practical
uniformity
amongst
all
handlers.
and
this
type
of
pooling
has
been
found
to
be
totally
inappropriate
for
this
particular
market.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
in
order
to
institute
that
type
of
pooling,
the
congress
has
provided
that
every
producer
should
have
one
vote
on
that
particular
issue
alone
in
a
separate
referendum
on
that
one
issue.
and
this,
in
our
mind
indicates
that
the
congress
was
concern
that
the
associations
could
sometimes
vote
hand
different
things
that
would
affect
their
membership
if
they
fail
to
consult
with
them
and
the
congress
wanted
to
preclude
this
type
of
happening.
also,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
respect
to
summary
judgment
that
the
lehigh
valley
case
was
heard
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
new
york
currency
producers
versus
wickard
case
was
heard
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
indeed,
the
petitioners
here
propose
in
january,
shortly
after
the
institution
of
this
suit
that
the
case
be
heard
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
now
subsequently,
they
withdrew
that
particular
proposal,
but
nevertheless,
they
were
desirers
of
disposing
of
the
suit
at
that
time
and
nothing
was
brought
up
in
the
district
court
that
would
in
anyway
reflect
on
the
propriety
of
the
granting
of
summary
judgment.
the
record
was
very
voluminous
five
large
files
in
the
administrative
record
numbered
many
hundreds
of
pages
as
illustrated
by
the
753-page
appendix
here
before
this
court.
so,
every
facet
of
this
particular
differential
was
considered
and
also
the
act
requires
that
the
secretary
institute
only
differential
that
had
been
customarily
applied
by
handlers.
now,
the
record,
the
administrative
record
reflects
that
this
differential
had
never
been
applied
by
handlers,
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
petitioners
advert
to
the
contracts
of
various
cooperatives.
none
of
these
being
in
a
matter
of
record
and
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
that
i
know
of,
there's
no
document
dairy
evidence
whatsoever
to
this
effect.
the
fact
is
that
the
records
choose
conclusively
that
this
particular
differential
did
not
exist
until
august
1,
1937
in
the
boston
order.
it
could
not
have
been
legalized
or
validated
by
the
congress
because
of
the
fact
that
the
1937
reenactment
occurred
on
june
3,
1937.
of
this
particular
differential
was
instituted
subsequent
to
that
time.
so,
there's
no
actual
question
of
reenactment
even
involved
this
case.
also,
they
alleged
that
similar
differentials
existed
prior
the
1937
however.
but
actually,
this
is
not
the
case
because
the
similar
differentials
actually
number
one,
required
delivery
of
the
milk
to
the
city
market
and
the
nearby
differential
does
not.
so,
we
have
that
distinguishment
here
between
the
pre
1937
and
the
post
1937
differential.
also,
the
similar
differentials
that
they're
referring
to
is
actually
what
is
known
under
the
act
base
rating.
base
rating
requires
that
all
dairy
farmers
receive
the
same
fluid
or
class
i
milk
price
for
their
base
milk.
but
under
the
1936
order,
only
the
nearby
producer
received
the
class
i
or
fluid
milk
price
for
his
base
milk.
many
producers
were
never
even
assigned
a
base
and
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
it
means
this
that
they
compute
the
demand,
the
normal
demands
of
the
market
and
they
divide
up
the
market,
the
fluid
milk
market
and
assign
each
producer
a
base.
and
the
base
is
a
quota
that
he
supposed
to
produce.
for
that
particular
quota,
he
will
received
the
fluid
milk
for
class
i
milk
price.
anything
he
produces
in
excess
of
that,
he
will
receive
the
manufactured
or
surplus
price.
now,
he
is
free
to
produce
as
much
milk
as
he
likes,
but
any
milk
produce
in
excess
of
his
base
is
paid
for
at
the
surplus
price.
under
the
act
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
in
1965
in
the
food
and
agriculture
act,
all
producers
are
entitled
to
received
that
fluid
or
class
i
price
for
their
base
milk.
you
cannot
give
it
that
price
to
the
nearby
producers
and
the
rest
of
the
surplus
to
the
distant
producers
and
this
is
what
is
referred
to
a
similar
differentials
by
the
petitioners
here.
actually,
this
is
an
admission
of
the
illegality
of
the
so-called
similar
differentials
because
of
the
very
fact
that
they
are
related
to
use
and
constitute
a
violation
of
the
base
rating
plans
of
the
act.
now,
they
have
mentioned
the
case
of
the
green
valley
creamery
from
the
first
circuit
has
been
authority
for
the
promulgation
of
this
particular
nearby
differential
as
a
market
differential.
we
just
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
green
valley
case,
there
were
no
producers
before
the
court.
that
was
a
handler
case
for
enforcement
and
involved
entirely
different
issue.
moreover,
the
court
there
did
not
even
examine
this
issue
for
the
very
reason
that
it
was
not
properly
before
the
court.
this
was
the
contention
of
the
government
that
handlers
could
not
question
disbursements
from
out
of
the
pool
and
that
therefore,
when
the
handlers
attempted
to
raise
this
argument
concerning
the
nearby
differential,
the
government's
argument
was
accepted
that
this
particular
contention
or
issue
could
not
be
raise
by
handlers.
so,
we
have
the
government
contending
that
they
have
relied
on
the
green
valley
decision
when
that
court
actually
accepted
its
argument
for
that
particular
issue
concerning
the
legality
of
a
nearby
differential
was
not
even
before
the
court.
also
the
green
valley
court
actually
fail
to
realize
that
the
market
differential
which
it
said
was
a
valid
differential
on
which
we
agree
was
already
in
the
order.
it
confused
the
market
differential
with
the
nearby
differential.
the
court
and
green
valley
thought
that
there
was
a
benefit
in
a
service
provided
when
milk
was
delivered
to
the
city
market
and
it
stated
that
it
was
of
the
impression
that
nearby
producers
did
deliver
their
milk
to
the
city
market.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
what
this
is
a
compensable
service
or
value.
but
this
was
already
in
the
order
and
a
reading
of
the
green
valley
case
will
illustrate
that
that
court
did
not
realize
that
this
particular
differential
was
already
in
the
order
and
the
producers
were
compensated
for
delivering
their
milk
to
the
city
market.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
well,
when
the
regulation
was
first
instituted
in
the
boston
milk
market,
there
were
a
small
number
of
producers
nearby
the
market
who
formed
an
association
known
as
a
nearby
producers
association.
although,
it
was
beyond
any
contradiction
that
all
producers
where
receiving
low
prices
for
their
milk
at
that
time,
they
contended
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
special
price
that
they
were
not
subject
to
equalization
as
required
by
the
act
and
they
threatened
to
become
an
menace
to
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
at
that
time
the
act
in
this
program
was
in
a
very
fledgling
state
and
they
needed
the
enforcement
support
of
the
state
of
massachusetts.
the
state
of
massachusetts
refuse
to
give
this
enforcement
support
unless
this
particular
concession
was
made
to
its
producers.
and
they
were
other
view
the
distant
producers
and
the
government
at
that
time
that
this
was
a
temporary
concession.
but
like
all
concessions
once
their
made,
it's
very
difficult
to
have
the
individual
set
or
receiving
the
particular
benefit
give
it
up.
in
fact
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no,
your
honor.
not
to
my
knowledge.
in
fact,
it's
not
in
the
act,
it's
not
in
report
send,
it's
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes,
state
claim
that
they
were
not
required
that
they
could
not
be
required
to
equalize
their
milk
production
with
other
dairy
farmers.
and
in
order
to
gain
the
--
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
yes.
in
other
words,
come
in
to
the
blend
price
and
this
was
in
effect,
a
temporary
acknowledgement
or
concession
to
them,
in
order
to
gain
the
enforcement
support
of
the
massachusetts
milk
control
board.
this
was
found
by
the
lower
court
to
be
a
fact
also.
in
order
words,
the
case
of
whiting
milk
company,
united
states
versus
whiting
milk
company
in
the
boston
market
in
the
30's
found
that
is
little
as
2,000
quarts
of
milk
or
one
tank
load
of
milk
introduce
in
the
boston
market,
not
subject
to
regulation
or
control
could
affect
the
entire
price
of
all
dairy
farmers.
consequently,
you
had
to
have
control
of
the
interstate
milk
and
unless
the
local
authorities
would
enforce
that
control
why
you
had
no
way
of
actually
controlling
the
milk
market
price
of
all
the
dairy
farmers.
so,
this
was
a
temporary
concession
in
that
respect,
although,
it
was
recognized
that
it
was
a
deviation
from
the
requirements
of
the
act.
now,
as
i
indicated
has
grown
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
introduce
during
1935
hearing,
1936
hearings
was
the
testimony
of
one
individual
who
referred
to
the
alleged
milk
price
receive
by
one
dairy
farmer
out
of
about
20,000
that
were
supplying
the
market.
and
even
that
price
to
one
dairy
farmer
was
admittedly
subject
to
correction.
the
only
other
evidence
that
was
introduce
that
would
purport
to
justify
this
was
the
prices
paid
by
two
handlers,
smaller
handlers
out
of
hundreds
that
were
operating
in
that
particular
market.
so
there
actually
wasn't
any
real
evidential
basis
for
the
awarding
to
this
differential,
and
this
is
all
brought
out
in
the
record.
these
hearings,
the
pertinent
parts
of
them
are
in
the
appendix.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
no.
not
at
that
time
because
of
the
fact
that
all
farmers
receiving
low
prices
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
patrick
ryan
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
vermont
is
trying
to
address
the
last
five
minutes.
thank
you.
