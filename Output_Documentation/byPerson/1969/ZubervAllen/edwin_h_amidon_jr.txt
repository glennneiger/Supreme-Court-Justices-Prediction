mr.
edwin
h.
amidon,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
edwin
h.
amidon.
i'm
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
vermont,
here
representing
the
state
of
vermont
and
its
attorney
general
and
its
secretary
of
agriculture
who
incidentally
are
here
today.
the
legal
argument
had
certainly
been
well
covered.
i
just
like
to
briefly
emphasize
some
additional
aspects
of
the
factual
context.
vermont,
unlike
i
think
almost
any
other
state
in
the
country
is
overwhelmingly
dependent
on
the
dairy
industry.
much
more
so,
even
in
wisconsin
and
in
addition,
the
overwhelming
majority
its
dairy
production
is
sold
under
this
order.
the
vermont
dairy
industry
secondly
is
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble
right
now.
it
is
lost
over
a
thousand
producers
since
1965.
third,
unlike
the
1930's
when
this
type
of
differential
was
first
adopted,
the
cause
of
dairy
farming
in
vermont
are
now
fully
as
high
as
they
are
in
southern
new
england.
taxes,
labor
fee,
the
equipment,
the
various
things
that
go
into
cause
of
producing
milk.
mr.
edwin
h.
amidon,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
may
been
implicit
in
the
secretary's
--
mr.
edwin
h.
amidon,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
orders,
but
i
think
it's
a
sub
silentio
factor
if
i
may
say
so.
fourthly
unlike
the
1930's,
i
think
the
accessibility,
availability,
reliability
of
non-nearby
producers
milk
is
equal
now
wholly
to
the
milk
of
southern
new
england
producers
and
evenness
of
production
your
honors,
if
formally
was
not
compensated
it
is,
it
is
now
compensated.
fifth,
i
should
say
that
the
vermont
farmers
who
are
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
non-nearby
producers
have
bought
this
nearby
differential
from
the
very
beginning.
they
have
never
acquiesced
in
it.
they
have
always
opposed
it.
and
of
course,
when
it
comes
to
vote
on
a
milk
order,
they
have
to
vote
for
the
milk
order
in
order
to
avoid
the
chaos
of
unregulated
milk
market
where
they
sell
most
of
their
milk.
if
they
didn't
vote
for
the
order
with
this
nearby
differential
in
it,
they'd
be
out
of
the
ball
game
anyway,
if
i
may
use
that
slang.
sixth,
there's
been
no
record
of
any
disruption
of
the
new
york-new
jersey
milk
market
since
the
decision
in
blair.
seventh,
and
this
is
already
been
said
in
vermont,
we
wonder
why
vermont
should
be
the
only
shall
we
say
recipient
of
this
nearby
differential.
we
are
most
of
the
non-nearby
producers
and
this
nearby
differential
is
only
found
in
new
england
milk
orders.
so
finally
in
conclusion,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
the
nearby
differential
or
farm
location
differential
is
not
an
authorize
adjustment
the
agricultural
marketing
act
of
1937.
it
in
fact
constitutes
really
a
de
facto
tariff
which
must
be
paid
by
vermont
farmers
for
the
privileges
of
selling
milk
in
southern
new
england.
thank
you
your
honors.
