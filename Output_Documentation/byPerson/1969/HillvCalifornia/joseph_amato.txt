mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you,
your
honor.
honorable
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
this
is
another
case
that
we
have
here
in
a
long
history
of
cases
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
decided
in
the
past
regarding
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
that
amendment
reads
as
follows,
“the
right
of
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
shall
not
be
violated,
and
no
warrants
shall
issue,
but
upon
probable
cause,
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched,
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.”
certainly,
this
court
has
treated
the
rights
of
private
citizen
in
the
past
with
great
emphasis.
weeks
versus
united
states
has
held
that
a
search
based
upon
reasonable
cause
is
allowed
incidental
to
arrest
providing
that
that
search
is
reasonable.
before
we
go
into
long
facts
situation
of
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
alleging
that
his
particular
arrest
which
was
an
invalid
arrest
and
then
subsequently
the
police
went
on
with
an
unreasonable
search
that
this
was
a
violation
to
his
fourth
amendment
rights
even
prior
to
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
people
versus
chimel.
certainly,
in
this
particular
case,
the
petitioner
appealed
and
opposed
all
information
and
all
evidence
regarding
that
particular
case
at
the
trial
level,
at
the
court
of
appeal,
at
the
supreme
court
and
now
here
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
the
particular
trial
court
at
the
time
they
were
ruling
on
the
evidence
of
particularly
the
diary
which
is
really
the
relevant
issue
in
this
particular
case
because
without
the
diary,
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
convict
the
particular
petitioner,
that
at
the
time
the
trial
judge
ruled
upon
the
admissibility
of
the
particular
evidence
and
the
diary
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
statement
that
a
ruling
adverse
to
the
prosecution
would
open
pandora's
box
to
the
particular
evidence
that
was
included
in
this
particular
case.
and
what
the
court
meant,
what
the
trial
court
meant
at
that
time
was
not
that
this
factual
situation
would
open
the
court,
but
this
was
opening
such
a
vast
exception
to
what
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
past.
it
wouldn't
fit,
allow,
and
arrest,
an
arrest
that
was
not
a
valid
arrest,
and
this
arrest
of
a
mistaken
person.
and
then
to
go
from
that
arrest
on
to
search
the
premises,
to
search
for
things
that
are
not
necessarily
connected
with
the
crime
or
the
fruits
of
the
particular
crime
the
police
were
searching
for.
well,
the
court
of
appeal
after
taking
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
we
have
a
question
that
this
comes
within
the
rule
of
chimel
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
it's
invalid
under
chimel.
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
the
big
issue
in
this
particular
case
although
i'm
sure
that
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
basis
of
chimel
and
the
decision
on
whether
to
make
it
retroactive
or
not
but
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case
had
this
go
on
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
of
california
reversed
based
upon
the
law
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
california
affirmed
the
conviction
in
using
those
same
two
cases
as
guidelines.
it
would
seem
based
on
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
petitioner
absent
from
his
residence
that
the
police
finding
information
out
from
co-companions
this
case
as
the
court
is
aware
of
involved
four
individuals
robbing
a
particular
house
and
then
two
of
those
individuals
shortly
thereafter,
a
day
or
two
thereafter
was
captured
by
the
police
on
an
unrelated
crime
possession
of
marijuana.
the
police
at
that
time
had
information
from
those
particular
police
officers
and
the
victims
of
the
robbery
itself
also
a
bystander.
so
it
is
not
the
petitioner's
contention
that
there
was
not
reasonable
cause
to
arrest
hill.
clearly,
there
was
but
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
rights
of
privacy
that
this
court
has
constantly
held
is
the
rights
of
privacy
of
the
house
and
not
the
fact
that
reasonable
cause
allowed
a
mistaken
arrest
to
then
give
effect
and
authority
to
an
unreasonable
search.
first
of
all,
the
arrest
itself
was
made
which
the
--
excuse
me,
the
petitioner
contends
in
debatably
good
faith.
first
of
all,
there
were
four
officers
in
this
case.
two
of
them
carrying
shot
guns
entered
into
the
office
of
hill.
i
should
say
the
apartment
of
hill.
miller
was
there.
miller
answered
the
particular
door
and
immediately
thereafter,
the
officers
arrested
miller.
miller
stated
that
he
was
not
miller.
miller
gave
identification
showing
that
he
was
not
miller
and
then
when
the
officers
asked
whether
or
not
miller
or
--
knew
where
hill
was,
miller
replied
no,
that
he
did
not
know
where
hill
was.
mr.
joseph
amato
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
i
think
from
the
standpoint,
when
you
take
all
these
factors,
the
fact
that
there
was
couple
inches
in
discrepancy
in
the
height,
10
pounds
in
the
weight
that
that
could
be
said
that
he
was
miller
and
that
he
was
in
hill's
apartment
that
at
this
particular
point
in
time,
he
showed
identification
that
he
was
miller.
there's
no
information
that
the
officers
had
prior
to
go
into
the
residence
of
hill
that
there
was
another
person
and
there
was
no
indication
that
miller
knew
that
the
officers
were
coming
in
there
or
hill.
so
the
officers
and
i
think
the
case
cited
in
the
friend
of
the
court
brief
shows
that
the
officers
are
required
to
use
diligence
and
prudence
when
they
arrest
the
particular
person
and
most
of
these
cases
hold
that
when
a
person
or
officer
does
not
use
diligence
that
in
fact
is
an
--
a
bad
faith
arrest.
in
one
particular
case
cited
by
the
friend
of
the
court
brief,
it
even
held
that
particular
officer
liable
in
damages
for
an
amount
of
$1,500.00
and
in
that
particular
dissenting
opinion
and
i'm
referring
to
walton
versus
will,
66
cal.
2d
509,
the
dissenting
opinion
stated
that
in
all
respects
the
description
of
accused
was
either
identical
with
or
closely
approximated
that
of
respondent
and
that
was
a
particular
same
name
case.
in
this
situation,
the
names
were
not
the
same
at
all.
archi
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
it
starts
from
that
premise
from
the
standpoint
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
in
all
these
particular
search
and
seizure
cases
that
all
the
facts
are
important
that
this
initial
arrest
should
also
be
considered
in
light
of
the
total
search
itself
which
the
petitioner
contends
is
unreasonable
so
then
we
go
on
to
the
search
itself.
the
search
was
directed
towards
the
bedroom,
a
material
search
which
disclosed
a
particular
diary
and
some
of
the
other
fruits
of
the
search.
a
diary
is
the
area
that
the
petitioner
contends
as
totally
unreasonable
as
far
as
the
search
is
concerned
and
that
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
rabinowitz,
with
harris
or
any
other
cases
that
this
particular
court
has
decided.
first
of
all,
the
officers
had
no
way
of
getting
the
search
warrant
based
upon
the
information
they
had
regarding
the
diary.
the
fact
that
they
were
able
to
search
that
particular
residence
and
assuming
they
are
allowed
to
search
the
drawers
and
rummage
through
the
particular
dresser
drawers,
this
court
has
always
state
in
the
past
that
because
you
have
a
lawful
search
does
necessarily
mean
that
you
have
a
right
to
seize.
in
the
respondent's
brief,
it
is
indicated
that
they
came
across
this
particular
diary
in
the
search
for
other
items
and
we're
talking
about
cameras,
we're
talking
about
clothes
and
certain
types
of
hoods
that
the
particular
suspects
wore
during
the
commission
of
the
robbery.
even
in
people
versus
harris
which
is
probably
the
most
liberal
decision
allowing
the
police
to
search,
this
court
held
that
not
in
all
cases
will
they
allow
such
an
extensive
search.
certainly,
in
harris
they
were
looking
for
checks,
two
to
$10,000.00
checks
and
by
the
nature
of
the
search,
by
the
nature
of
the
things
that
they
were
looking
for,
it
would
require
looking
into
a
particular
drawer
or
books
or
personal
belongings.
but
what
information
the
officers
had
in
this
particular
case
did
not
require
that
type
of
search.
and
if
in
fact
they
did
and
as
concluded
by
this
court,
that
they
made
a
reasonable
search
then
it's
submitted
by
the
petitioner
that
it
was
an
unlawful
seizure.
and
boyd
versus
united
states
has
held
that
an
unlawful
search
or
an
unlawful
seizure
are
not
dependent
upon
each
other.
so
certainly,
the
petitioner
is
strongly
contending
for
that
one
item
alone
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
amato
your
honor,
we
assume
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question.
we
have
not
raised
issues
that
we
don't
think
are
extremely
material
and
relevant
or
strong
issues
so
to
speak.
we
have
raised
issues
relevant
to
the
arrest
itself
and
the
seizure
itself
and
certainly
we
wanted
the
arrest
itself,
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
the
person
that
the
officers
were
there
to
make
sure
that
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
were
before
the
court.
certainly,
it
doesn't
need
dwelling
on
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
which
the
california
supreme
court
relied
on
to
affirm
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
is
totally
different
from
the
fact
situation
in
this
case.
i
already
indicated
this
in
my
particular
brief
and
i
don't
believe
it
needs
elaboration
on
at
this
time
but
certainly
we
are
emphasizing
at
this
time
that
there
is
really
no
degree
of
consistency
with
the
fact
situation,
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
case
as
compared
to
the
case
at
bar.
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
second
point
and
that's
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
this
court
will
make
chimel,
people
versus
chimel
retroactive
or
not.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
directly
comes
into
play
another
part,
another
exception,
another
area
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
to
press
their
case.
i
think
it's
another
area
that
this
court
could
reverse
in
addition
to
the
very
initial
contention
the
petitioners
made.
and
that
is
the
fact
that
chimel,
people
versus
chimel
decided
last
year
clearly
limits
the
police
to
search
a
particular
residence
and
while
many
questions
have
been
raised
as
to
how
far
the
police
are
allowed
to
search
certainly,
this
instance
where
the
particular
arrest
was
made
in
the
living
room
or
this
court
hasn't
cited
that
as
not
a
material
fact.
then
the
search
was
made
beyond
the
immediate
scope
of
the
particular
petitioner
that
i
quote,
“petitioner
because
in
fact
he
was
not
even
present
that
the
arrest
could
not
or
search
could
not
pursue
into
the
living
room,
into
drawers
and
in
fact
the
general
and
exploratory
search
to
find
evidence
of
the
crime.”
mr.
joseph
amato
this
apartment
was
a
one
bedroom,
kitchen
and
a
small
living
room
apartment,
a
four-room
apartment.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
miller
was
lying
on
the
couch.
when
the
four
policemen
came
in,
he
went
to
the
door
and
was
immediately
arrested
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
amato
it
was
found
in
the
bedroom,
in
a
small
drawer
in
the
bedroom.
mr.
joseph
amato
now,
insofar
as
retroactivity
on
this
particular
case,
certainly,
this
court
has
decided
that
it
depends
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
depending
on
the
law,
the
actual
effect
that
will
have
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
whether
or
not
it
will
serve
to
a
good
effect
on
the
past
content
of
the
courts.
now,
it
is
contended
that
the
administration
of
justice
will
be
strongly
effective
as
a
result
of
making
chimel
retroactive.
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
will
not
in
fact
be
the
case,
that
the
courts
are
extremely
flexible,
and
in
the
past,
time
and
time
again,
the
courts
on
major
counties
have
been
able
to
take
some
of
their
civil
judges
and
utilize
them
for
criminal
manners
and
this
happens
on
occasion
even
if
when
there
is
no
strong
decision
from
this
court
changing
the
particular
law.
the
petitioner
strongly
contends
that
making
chimel
retroactive
will
not
have
that
greater
effect
on
the
particular
administration
of
justice
from
the
standpoint
of
having
a
lot
of
criminals
who've
been
unconstitutionally
convicted
are
being
released.
petitioners
contended
in
his
reply
brief
that
surely
the
appeals
that
are
pending
now
could
easily
affect
the
laws
as
this
court
has
enunciated
in
people
versus
chimel.
it
seems
appropriate
that
when
you
review
the
cases
regarding
this
particular
problem
in
alaska
supreme
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
mexico
that
these
cases
have
applied
chimel
on
direct
appeals
only
and
then
when
you
review
the
cases
you
also
see
that
they
applied
to
these
particular
cases
without
opinion.
and
when
the
cases
are
not
utilizing
chimel
on
direct
appeal
that
they
seem
to
state
what
this
court
has
stated
in
stovall
versus
california
and
the
desist
case
setting
forth
the
three
criteria
that
this
court
strongly
considers
in
their
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
case
in
criminal
law
should
be
made
retroactive
or
not.
but
that
the
courts
in
fact
have
just
come
to
a
conclusion
that
when
there
is
a
constitutional
finding
before
it
that
they
review
the
facts
as
the
law
as
it
is
in
that
pending
appeal.
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
satisfied
with
the
law
of
opinion
or
justification
but
that
in
fact
it
seems
reasonable
to
those
particular
judges
that
this
case
should
be
made
as
the
law
has
stated
by
this
court
and
that
set
some
date
that
when
a
particular
case,
an
arrest
was
made
two
to
three
years
ago
and
have
all
those
particular
arrests,
then
based
upon
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional
or
not
constitutional
and
that's
immaterial
because
the
date
of
the
arrest
to
chimel,
the
date
of
seizure,
search
and
seizure
is
not
the
same
date
as
specified
in
the
pending
appeal.
this
particular
case
was
close
to
chimel.
the
petitioner
contended
at
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeal
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
law
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
i
am
referring
back
to
the
first
issue
if
i
may
was
not
constitutionally
sanctioned
to
search
even
at
that
time.
so
certainly
insofar
as
chimel
is
concerned
which
far
limits
the
courts
and
far
limits
the
courts
in
affirming
the
rights
of
the
police
officers
to
search.
it
would
be
submitted
by
this
petitioner
that
certainly
chimel
should
made
retroactive
at
least
that
the
case
is
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
answering
the
last
question
first,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
in
this
particular
case,
each
case
is
certainly
decided
by
its
own
facts.
now,
justice
frankfurter
in
dissent
in
harris
indicated
what
is
the
criteria
that
the
officers
have
when
they
make
the
particular
search.
how
far
it
can
go?
and
really,
the
decisions
aren't
that
clear.
you
can't
determine
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
unreasonable
as
far
as
the
extent
of
the
search.
now,
how
far
can
you
go?
can
you
go
upstairs?
can
you
go
to
the
third
floor,
to
the
fourth
floor?
mr.
joseph
amato
i
believe
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that
--
that
part
is
true
but
as
far
as
now
to
the
extent
of
the
search.
now,
how
could
you
make
a
search
in
a
particular
apartment
of
a
diary
when
in
fact,
even
before
they
went
to
that
particular
apartment,
they
could
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
they
didn't
know
enough
information
within
that
particularity
to
get
a
magistrate
to
sign
a
search
warrant
specifying
that
particular
diary.
the
information
that
they
have
available
did
not
include
that
information.
they
could
have
got
a
search
warrant
for
the
particular
information
that
they
knew
about
from
their
co-defendants
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
that
is
so
general
in
nature,
your
honor.
you
would
have
to
specify
what
type
of
books,
what
general
--
you're
talking
about
maybe
the
county
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
well
your
honor
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
states
in
itself
that
you
have
to
be
more
specific
than
just
to
be
so
general.
that's
why
the
general
warrant
has
been
outlawed
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i
say
that
is
insufficient
to
justify
a
search
warrant
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
amato
not
the
total
search
warrant.
i
think
it
will
be
justified
from
the
standpoint
of
the
parts
that
they
set
forth
with
clarity
and
it
would
extend
to
the
diary
which
would
be
illegal
at
which
if
they
brought
in
the
diary
it
would
be
insufficient
but
as
far
as
the
evidence
it
would
be
alright
as
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned.
now,
counsel
brought
out
a
fact
that
bader
who
was
in
custody
consented
to
the
officers
to
go
to
the
petitioner's
apartment.
i
think
the
california
court
simply
stated
in
my
reply
brief
that
bader
who
has
held
in
custody
does
not
have
the
authority
to
strip
the
petitioner
of
all
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
certainly
because
bader
said
he
could
go
to
that
particular
apartment
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
go
ahead,
the
officer
can
go
ahead
and
search
it
and
as
far
as
the
petitioner
contends,
an
unreasonable
search.
now,
this
point
about
this
bacca,
b-a-c-c-a.
now,
bacca
was
the
third
person
who
was
not
in
custody.
meaning
two
of
the
defendants
were
in
custody,
the
petitioner
was
not
available.
so
the
respondent
says,
there's
a
very
big
emergency
here,
“we
can't
go
back
and
get
a
search
warrant.”
well,
what
is
the
emergency
here?
what
we're
talking
about
its
four
individuals,
police
officers,
two
shotguns
would
have
already
arrested
miller.
now,
we
have
in
fact
if
they
thought
it
was
miller
then
they
have
three
of
the
four.
the
fourth
man
is
not
in
custody.
the
fourth
man
has
access
into
this
particular
place.
so
it
seemed
to
me,
that
if
they
wanted
to
get
this
particular
and
protect
the
particular
goods
that
were
in
that
apartment
and
search
it
more
in
detail
at
a
later
time,
proper
and
reasonable
police
procedure
would
be
to
have
the
officers
stay
at
the
apartment
to
survey
it
and
if
that
fourth
suspect
comes
back
then
they
can
make
the
arrest
at
that
time,
it
would
seem
that
that
would
be
an
asset
to
not
search
the
apartment
rather
than
have
to
search
it
right
away
and
be
fearful
that
this
particular
bacca
would
come
back
and
take
the
goods
from
that
particular
apartment.
now,
in
so
far
as
this
diary
and
this
is
what
the
petitioner
is
contending
at
this
time
is
completely
unreasonable.
the
other
items
that
were
searched,
the
petitioner
contends,
it
is
possible
under
rabinowitz
and
harris
that
these
items
may
have
been
able
to
been
searched
and
properly
seized
by
the
officers.
but
in
so
far
as
that
particular
diary
is
concerned,
i
think
it's
the
burden
upon
the
prosecution
when
they
are
attempting
to
make
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
particular
officer
show
enough
authority
and
enough
diligence
and
prudence
to
justify
that
particular
search
and
to
show
it
into
evidence
and
not
have
the
petitioner
show
that
he
has
the
right
supported
by
the
fourth
amendment
but
rather
have
the
prosecution
show
the
exceptions
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
amato
no,
your
honor,
i
concede
only
that
it
may
have
possibly
been.
certainly,
this
case
regarding
the
diary
to
me
seems
so
clear
cut
in
reviewing
the
case
decisions
in
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
all
the
other
decisions,
weeks
and
leftkowitz,
go-bart
company
and
reviewing
in
the
light
of
chimel,
all
these
cases
make
it
so
crystal
clear
to
myself
and
that
the
particular
seizure,
search
and
seizure
of
the
diary
was
improper.
the
most
you
can
get
i
think
is
the
search
was
valid,
the
seizure
is
difficult
to
comprehend
as
far
as,
in
light
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
were
making
in
general
exploratory
search
--
mr.
joseph
amato
or
seizure.
mr.
joseph
amato
oh!
your
honor,
that's
relevant
and
material,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
joseph
amato
that's
without
a
search
warrant,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
amato
i
would
say
your
honor.
i
think
it
depends
on
circumstances.
in
the
first
instance
if
the
officers
knew
or
had
reason
or
any
evidence
or
any
probable
cause
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i'll
say
that
they
cannot
seize
that
particular
evidence
without
a
search
warrant.
i
have
no
further
question,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
be
rather
brief
in
as
much
as
this
re-argument
and
some
of
the
factual
arguments
have
been
made
by
prior
counsel
today.
i
would
like
to
briefly,
if
i
may,
go
over
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
had
a
situation
in
this
case,
where
there
was
a
robbery,
four
individuals
robbed
a
particular
residence
and
then
took
some
money,
canvas
and
some
other
personal
property.
the
day
after
the
robbery
which
was
june
4th,
the
robbery
date
being
june
4th.
on
june
5th,
two
of
the
four
accomplices
to
this
particular
robbery
were
captured
in
a
narcotics
situation.
and
they
were
captured
in
the
car
of
the
petitioner
archie
hill,
along
with
other
personal
property
that
was
recovered.
the
two
particular
individuals
that
were
captured
told
the
officers
that
archie
hill
was
one
of
the
four
participants
in
this
robbery.
they
implicated
him
to
this
particular
crime.
the
police
then
checked
out
the
association,
the
petitioner
archie
hill
with
the
other
two
participants
in
the
police
records
that
they
had
available.
they
got
the
description
of
archie
hill
which
was
approximately
5’10”,
160
lbs.
they
got
the
address
and
so
forth.
on
the
6th
of
june,
they
proceeded
to
the
residence
of
archie
hill,
the
petitioner.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
was
not
in
his
apartment.
we’re
talking
about
a
four
room
apartment,
one
bedroom.
there
was
a
mr.
miller
in
the
apartment.
the
officers
came
in
to
the
apartment
and
upon
noticing
mr.
miller,
made
an
immediate
arrest,
thereafter
shoving
miller
aside,
searching
the
other
rooms
and
finding
nothing.
at
that
time
mr.
miller
indicated
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
he
showed
the
officers
identification
showing
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
he
further
indicated
that
he
was
waiting
for
mr.
hill.
the
officers
in
this
case
did
not
ask
permission
to
search
the
premises.
thereafter,
they
spent
approximately
two
hours,
making
an
extensive
search
of
the
particular
apartment.
now,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
recover
the
personal
property,
additional
personal
property
and
the
weapons
which
included
two
knives
and
two
guns
in
the
apartment
house.
mr.
joseph
amato
the
search
took
place
after
mr.
miller
was
arrested.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
mr.
hill
was
not
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
miller
who
in
fact
was
mr.
miller
was
arrested.
he
stated
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
the
police
said
that
the
identification
meant
nothing
to
them
that
he
flipped
the
description
of
mr.
hill
exactly.
and
therefore,
they
felt
that
because
criminals
tend
to
in
many
instances,
to
avoid
arrest,
they
will
falsify
their
identification.
so
in
this
situation,
mr.
miller
was
in
fact
mr.
miller.
mr.
hill
was
not
in
the
apartment
at
all.
now,
the
search
was
very
extensive.
they
went
all
over.
and
what
they
recovered
which
is
extremely
damaging
to
the
petitioner
in
this
action
was
a
personal
diary
in
a
drawer,
in
the
dresser.
and
the
reason
why
this
particular
evidence
is
extremely
damaging
even
though
they
found
other
evidence
associated
with
the
crime,
is
because
bader
who
was
one
of
the
four
accomplices
lived
with
the
petitioner.
and
he
stated
that
he
was
involved
in
the
particular
crime.
now
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
that
reversed
this,
indicated
that
police
were
acting
in
good
faith
when
they
did
reverse
the
conviction.
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
there
that
could
be
argued.
that
they
were
not
exercising
good
faith
but
the
court
of
appeal
in
reversing
stated
that
the
officers
apparently
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
amato
the
trial
court
--
mr.
joseph
amato
the
trial
court
in
this
situation,
i
think
it
is
important
what
the
trial
court
said
and
what
they
were
thinking
at
that
time.
they
took
two
days
after
this
trial.
excuse
me,
after
this
matter
was
submitted
to
make
a
determination.
and
in
the
trial
record,
the
court
indicated
that
the
officers
were
acting
in
good
faith.
however,
the
court
further
indicated
that
he
realized
that
he
may
be
opening
pandora’s
box
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
was
never
intended
to
go
this
far.
now,
certainly
we
contend
strongly
right
from
the
outset
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
are
not
applicable
to
this
particular
case.
certainly,
counsel
in
the
prior
cases
have
already
indicated
this,
insofar
as
the
factual
details
of
rabinowitz
and
harris.
the
location,
the
office
in
rabinowitz,
the
public
manner
and
so
forth,
the
fact
that
a
continuing
crime
was
committed,
and
then
when
you
compare
it
to
a
particular
diary,
something
that
the
officers,
even
if
they
have
the
knowledge
of
that
diary.
even
if
they
had
plenty
of
time,
could
never
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
that
diary.
and
yet
--
mr.
joseph
amato
the
diary
was
found
in
a
dresser
drawer
in
the
bedroom.
mr.
joseph
amato
just
a
couple
of
pages,
but
they
were
the
damning
pages
implicating
the
petitioner
in
this
--
and
really
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that
is
not
clear
from
the
record
your
honor
but
it
is
just
a
couple
of
pages.
mr.
joseph
amato
your
honor,
i
didn’t
handle
this
matter
in
the
trial
level
and
the
only
reason
i
didn’t
object
was
the
same
basis
that
i
didn’t
object
to
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
kidnapping
under
in
effect
the
lindbergh
law.
and
clearly
the
facts
that
i’ve
stated
here,
do
not
indicate
any
type
of
kidnapping.
fortunately,
the
superior
court
in
san
francisco
county
has
reversed
that
to
habeas
corpus.
and
this
leaves,
i
think
possibly
to
another
matter
here
where
we
are
talking
about
the
second
degree
robbery.
here
is
an
individual
serving
the
fifth
year
in
the
state
prison
on
an
effect,
a
one
year
minimum
prison
sentence.
the
rabinowitz
case
and
the
harris
case,
i
think
when
you
review
those
cases
very
carefully,
it’s
interesting
to
know
that
they
infer
throughout
the
decision
itself
that
it
should
apply
to
those
particular
facts
in
rabinowitz
and
harris.
but
unfortunately,
this
court
did
not
see
fit
to
expressly
state
that.
and
as
a
result,
the
states
across
this
country
have
just
murdered
this
decision,
giving
it
unrealistic
results
as
far
as
this
particular
petitioner’s
contentions
concerned
are.
certainly,
the
factual
situations
when
you
put
rabinowitz
and
harris
together
come
up
with
a
situation
where
really
you
could
almost
fit,
nearly
every
factual
situation
to
a
situation
where
you
do
not
need
a
search
warrant
and
if
you
get
the
search
warrant,
you’re
better
off
without
it
because
you
can
go
further
like
in
this
particular
case,
they
never
could
have
got
any
search
warrant
for
that
diary
and
yet
because
they
have
gone
beyond
the
scope,
they’re
able
to
bring
in
this
extremely
damaging
evidence.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
in
this
particular
case
they
--
in
the
first
place,
they
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
particular
diary.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
yes
your
honor
then
there’d
be
a
strong
fifth
amendment
objection
compelling
the
particular
petitioner
to
get
evidence
of
this
sort
which
is
self
incriminating,
if
in
fact
they
knew
this
particular
evidence.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
this
is
different
than
warden
and
hayden
and
several
--
mr.
joseph
amato
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
right
your
honor
it
was.
now,
insofar
as
retroactivity
and
i
think
all
the
other
points
are
spelled
out
in
the
brief
and
since
this
is
re-argument,
i
will
at
least
reserve
until
i
hear
the
attorney
general,
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
is
concerned,
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
to
go
that
far.
i
don’t
think
and
of
course,
the
arguments
i
would
espouse
would
be
the
same
as
adequate
expressed
in
the
williams
case
that
here
is
a
case
that
is
on
direct
appeal.
that
one
of
the
differences
and
big
differences
that
i
think
this
court
should
consider
when
a
case
is
on
direct
appeal
and
one
that
is
being
attacked
collaterally
from
the
stand
point
of
retroactivity
is
the
fact
that
on
direct
appeal,
certainly
the
government
and
the
attorney
general
and
all
those
prosecutors
should
be
fully
aware
that
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
case
will
be
reversed
and
they
should
keep
their
witnesses
and
keep
their
evidence
and
keep
all
the
things
necessary
to
prosecute
the
case
again
in
advance
pending
the
possibility
of
a
reversal.
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
there
to
be
any
time
limit
but
a
direct
appeal
expressly
on
the
issues
that
are
involved.
now,
i
believe
the
government
in
the
prior
case
just
mentioned
that
if
bringing
up
appeals
on
various
other
matters,
well,
not
relevant
to
the
particular
issues
that
are
involved
here.
and
then
they
come
in
on
that
way,
there
could
be
exceptions
to
that
extent.
mr.
joseph
amato
under
certain
exceptions
your
honor,
provide
he
is
unavailable.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
in
conclusion
here
at
this
time,
i
would
just
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
this
case
right
from
the
outset
was
attacked
on
the
rabinowitz
and
harris
theory
that
really
chimel
was
not
a
criteria
so
far
as
taking
this
case
up
and
that
during
the
whole
procedure
up,
it
was
a
very
difficult
question.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
it
was
difficult
was
because
of
the
expanded
critical
decisions
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
as
we
have
gone
along
in
time.
and
the
trial
court,
when
they
indicated,
they
are
open
at
pandora’s
door
was
not
as
the
attorney
general
indicates
in
this
case.
opening
a
situation
where
if
every
case,
there
is
a
person
who
is
not
in
that
particular
apartment,
then
all
of
a
sudden,
you
have
opened
the
door
in
that
area.
what
they
are
talking
about
really
was
rabinowitz
and
harris
gave
the
government
wide
latitudes
in
the
search.
now,
we
are
going
to
a
situation
where
the
person
doesn’t
even
have
to
be
there,
then
all
of
a
sudden,
you
come
to
a
situation
where
really
there
just
isn’t
going
to
be
any
exceptions
to
amount
to
a
material
reason
why
they
cannot
search
once
they
have
the
arrest.
and
i
would
submit
in
the
interest
of
justice,
particularly
in
this
case.
and
i’m
arguing
particularly
in
this
case
because
of
the
situation
where
the
equities
should
come
out
where
here,
an
individual
has
served
in
his
fifth
year
on
a
minimum
one
year
has
never
been
up
for
parole
because
he
was
convicted
of
a
kidnapping
charge
that
he
clearly
did
not
do
at
the
time.
and
the
courts
are
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
this
year,
it
was
set
aside.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor,
i’m
--
mr.
joseph
amato
it
really
is
not.
i’m
just
indicating
this
as
an
equitable
situation
when
you’re
drawing
a
very
close
line
in
this
case
because
the
trial
courts
in
california
knew
about
rabinowitz,
knew
about
harris.
the
trial
court
made
that
statement
in
the
record
at
the
time.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
3:0
against
and
it’s
just
not
that
clear
cut
of
a
case.
and
i
think
some
times
in
those
type
of
cases
the
information
like
that
might
be
helpful.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
amato
one
minute.
mr.
joseph
amato
i’d
like
to
just
hit
on
four
points
your
honor
very
briefly.
the
first
one
insofar
as
the
fifth
amendment
was
concerned,
of
course
the
problem
there,
it
is
an
involvement
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
many
respects.
the
reason
it
wasn’t
specifically
brought
out
on
appeal
is
because
it
wasn’t
objected
to
at
the
trial.
i
have
no
where
indicated
anytime
during
the
court
of
appeals,
supreme
court
or
petition,
that
this
wasn’t
a
consideration.
it
was
only
not
mentioned
because
the
trial
attorney
at
that
time
didn’t
object
the
most
particular
grounds.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
there
is
a
court
rule
that
you
cannot.
i
could
have
brought
it
in
--
in
effect
of
counsel.
however,
he
--
i
didn’t
think
was
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
oh,
as
far
as
the
briefing,
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct,
i
did
not.
the
second
basis
now
is
bader’s
consent.
now,
insofar
as
consent,
the
petitioner
contends
strongly
that
there
was
no
consent
given.
i
think,
the
words
in
the
transcript
are
and
i
quote
“that
he
could
go
to
petitioner’s
apartment.”
and
i
think
that’s
a
far
cry
from
giving
consent
to
search
into
drawers
in
the
bedroom.
the
third
point
that
i’d
like
to
add
is
--
mr.
joseph
amato
--
go
see
mr.
hill
and
inquire
mr.
hill
what
the
circumstances
were.
and
if
he
doesn’t
say
you
can
search
my
drawers,
or
search
my
places,
i
would
indicate
and
go
to
the
apartment
and
meet
mr.
hill
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
amato
i
would
still
say
your
honor
the
same
thing
applies.
i
think,
on
two
counts.
one
is,
he
wasn’t
given
expressed
permission
to
search.
and
secondly,
there
is
another
serious
questions
to
whether
another
person
can
give
up
the
constitutional
privacy,
another
part.
now,
insofar
as
the
amicus
curiae
brief
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
colorado
and
the
police
chiefs
across
the
country.
i
too
believe
that
this
is
a
good
case.
that
guidelines
could
be
set
as
to
what
the
police
can
and
cannot
do.
but
it
still
doesn’t
take
even
those
examples
really
go
back
to
this
particular
case.
the
examples
there
are
pretty
extreme
and
yet
that
the
attorney
general
points
out
in
colorado.
and
yet
in
all
those
cases
that
he
points
out,
those
extreme
examples
where
certainly
there
is
a
necessity
for
guidelines.
the
attorney
general
was
able
to
get
convictions
in
all
of
those
matters
expressed
even
though
they
had
to
go
and
get
the
search
warrant.
in
this
case,
i
think
it
isn’t
that
close
of
an
issue.
now
insofar
as
retroactivity
and
counsel
has
indicated
that
30
officers
in
los
angeles
will
be
required
if
it
is
made
retroactive,
the
chimel
decision.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that’s
what
i
was
alluding
to,
improperly
stated.
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
draw
some
happy
median
and
drop
it
from
maybe
30
officers
to
one
officer
on
direct
appeal.
those
cases
certainly
outnumber,
at
least
on
a
30:1
basis.
mr.
joseph
amato
then
i
ask,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
30
officers?
what
difference
does
that
basically
make?
in
other
words,
the
inference
that
i
got
and
although
i
didn’t
quite
understand
it,
if
you
need
30
officers,
on
something
that’s
already
passed,
you
don’t
need
any
officers,
what
differences
does
it
make?
i
thought
the
point
he
was
trying
to
bring
out
was
the
fact
that
if
you
make
it
completely
retroactive,
you’re
going
to
have
to
accumulate
a
lot
of
this
evidence
based
on
past
cases.
and
now,
i’m
saying
that
if
you
have
to
get
additional
man
power,
that
if
you
make
it
only
on
direct
appeals,
certainly
a
30:1
ratio
isn't
unreasonable
in
light
of
all
the
years
that
are
involved
prior
to
chimel
versus
the
cases
on
direct
appeal.
i
like
to
conclude
with
this
last
point
that
i
wasn’t
going
to
mention
until
counsel
mentioned
about
the
numbers
of
crime
and
so
forth.
i
don’t
stand
up
here
for
a
crime.
i
hope
no
attorney
or
citizen
does.
certainly,
numbers
can
be
misleading.
and
i
think
earlier
in
this
case,
i
pointed
that
out
where
the
gravity
of
this
plan
was
elevated
to
kidnapping
where
in
fact
harold
chessman
died
under
the
same
penal
code
section.
and
this
court
knows
the
facts
of
this
case
and
certainly
he
was
subjected
to
the
death
penalty
also.
and
yet,
there
would
have
been
totally
unreasonable
in
this
case.
just
as
we
indicated,
it’s
been
totally
unreasonable
to
go
into
the
bedroom
and
to
get
that
diary
and
there’s
no
indication
that
this
particular
diary
wasn’t
a
book.
the
only
evidence
and
if
it
wasn’t
a
book,
it
should
have
been
brought
out
by
the
prosecution.
the
only
evidence
is
that
there
was
two
pages
of
a
diary.
no
weapons
could
have
been
or
supposedly
no
weapons
could
have
been
within
those
two
pages.
there
is
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
it
was
anything
different
from
the
ordinary
two
sheets
of
paper.
i
would
submit
strongly
your
honor,
in
the
interest
really
of
justice
in
this
particular
case
that
this
case
--
that
this
court
reverse
the
supreme
court
and
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you,
your
honor.
honorable
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
this
is
another
case
that
we
have
here
in
a
long
history
of
cases
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
decided
in
the
past
regarding
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
that
amendment
reads
as
follows,
“the
right
of
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
shall
not
be
violated,
and
no
warrants
shall
issue,
but
upon
probable
cause,
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched,
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.”
certainly,
this
court
has
treated
the
rights
of
private
citizen
in
the
past
with
great
emphasis.
weeks
versus
united
states
has
held
that
a
search
based
upon
reasonable
cause
is
allowed
incidental
to
arrest
providing
that
that
search
is
reasonable.
before
we
go
into
long
facts
situation
of
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
alleging
that
his
particular
arrest
which
was
an
invalid
arrest
and
then
subsequently
the
police
went
on
with
an
unreasonable
search
that
this
was
a
violation
to
his
fourth
amendment
rights
even
prior
to
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
people
versus
chimel.
certainly,
in
this
particular
case,
the
petitioner
appealed
and
opposed
all
information
and
all
evidence
regarding
that
particular
case
at
the
trial
level,
at
the
court
of
appeal,
at
the
supreme
court
and
now
here
before
the
united
states
supreme
court.
the
particular
trial
court
at
the
time
they
were
ruling
on
the
evidence
of
particularly
the
diary
which
is
really
the
relevant
issue
in
this
particular
case
because
without
the
diary,
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
convict
the
particular
petitioner,
that
at
the
time
the
trial
judge
ruled
upon
the
admissibility
of
the
particular
evidence
and
the
diary
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
statement
that
a
ruling
adverse
to
the
prosecution
would
open
pandora's
box
to
the
particular
evidence
that
was
included
in
this
particular
case.
and
what
the
court
meant,
what
the
trial
court
meant
at
that
time
was
not
that
this
factual
situation
would
open
the
court,
but
this
was
opening
such
a
vast
exception
to
what
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
past.
it
wouldn't
fit,
allow,
and
arrest,
an
arrest
that
was
not
a
valid
arrest,
and
this
arrest
of
a
mistaken
person.
and
then
to
go
from
that
arrest
on
to
search
the
premises,
to
search
for
things
that
are
not
necessarily
connected
with
the
crime
or
the
fruits
of
the
particular
crime
the
police
were
searching
for.
well,
the
court
of
appeal
after
taking
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
we
have
a
question
that
this
comes
within
the
rule
of
chimel
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
it's
invalid
under
chimel.
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
the
big
issue
in
this
particular
case
although
i'm
sure
that
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
the
basis
of
chimel
and
the
decision
on
whether
to
make
it
retroactive
or
not
but
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case
had
this
go
on
the
court
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeal
of
california
reversed
based
upon
the
law
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
california
affirmed
the
conviction
in
using
those
same
two
cases
as
guidelines.
it
would
seem
based
on
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
petitioner
absent
from
his
residence
that
the
police
finding
information
out
from
co-companions
this
case
as
the
court
is
aware
of
involved
four
individuals
robbing
a
particular
house
and
then
two
of
those
individuals
shortly
thereafter,
a
day
or
two
thereafter
was
captured
by
the
police
on
an
unrelated
crime
possession
of
marijuana.
the
police
at
that
time
had
information
from
those
particular
police
officers
and
the
victims
of
the
robbery
itself
also
a
bystander.
so
it
is
not
the
petitioner's
contention
that
there
was
not
reasonable
cause
to
arrest
hill.
clearly,
there
was
but
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
rights
of
privacy
that
this
court
has
constantly
held
is
the
rights
of
privacy
of
the
house
and
not
the
fact
that
reasonable
cause
allowed
a
mistaken
arrest
to
then
give
effect
and
authority
to
an
unreasonable
search.
first
of
all,
the
arrest
itself
was
made
which
the
--
excuse
me,
the
petitioner
contends
in
debatably
good
faith.
first
of
all,
there
were
four
officers
in
this
case.
two
of
them
carrying
shot
guns
entered
into
the
office
of
hill.
i
should
say
the
apartment
of
hill.
miller
was
there.
miller
answered
the
particular
door
and
immediately
thereafter,
the
officers
arrested
miller.
miller
stated
that
he
was
not
miller.
miller
gave
identification
showing
that
he
was
not
miller
and
then
when
the
officers
asked
whether
or
not
miller
or
--
knew
where
hill
was,
miller
replied
no,
that
he
did
not
know
where
hill
was.
mr.
joseph
amato
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
i
think
from
the
standpoint,
when
you
take
all
these
factors,
the
fact
that
there
was
couple
inches
in
discrepancy
in
the
height,
10
pounds
in
the
weight
that
that
could
be
said
that
he
was
miller
and
that
he
was
in
hill's
apartment
that
at
this
particular
point
in
time,
he
showed
identification
that
he
was
miller.
there's
no
information
that
the
officers
had
prior
to
go
into
the
residence
of
hill
that
there
was
another
person
and
there
was
no
indication
that
miller
knew
that
the
officers
were
coming
in
there
or
hill.
so
the
officers
and
i
think
the
case
cited
in
the
friend
of
the
court
brief
shows
that
the
officers
are
required
to
use
diligence
and
prudence
when
they
arrest
the
particular
person
and
most
of
these
cases
hold
that
when
a
person
or
officer
does
not
use
diligence
that
in
fact
is
an
--
a
bad
faith
arrest.
in
one
particular
case
cited
by
the
friend
of
the
court
brief,
it
even
held
that
particular
officer
liable
in
damages
for
an
amount
of
$1,500.00
and
in
that
particular
dissenting
opinion
and
i'm
referring
to
walton
versus
will,
66
cal.
2d
509,
the
dissenting
opinion
stated
that
in
all
respects
the
description
of
accused
was
either
identical
with
or
closely
approximated
that
of
respondent
and
that
was
a
particular
same
name
case.
in
this
situation,
the
names
were
not
the
same
at
all.
archi
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
it
starts
from
that
premise
from
the
standpoint
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
in
all
these
particular
search
and
seizure
cases
that
all
the
facts
are
important
that
this
initial
arrest
should
also
be
considered
in
light
of
the
total
search
itself
which
the
petitioner
contends
is
unreasonable
so
then
we
go
on
to
the
search
itself.
the
search
was
directed
towards
the
bedroom,
a
material
search
which
disclosed
a
particular
diary
and
some
of
the
other
fruits
of
the
search.
a
diary
is
the
area
that
the
petitioner
contends
as
totally
unreasonable
as
far
as
the
search
is
concerned
and
that
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
rabinowitz,
with
harris
or
any
other
cases
that
this
particular
court
has
decided.
first
of
all,
the
officers
had
no
way
of
getting
the
search
warrant
based
upon
the
information
they
had
regarding
the
diary.
the
fact
that
they
were
able
to
search
that
particular
residence
and
assuming
they
are
allowed
to
search
the
drawers
and
rummage
through
the
particular
dresser
drawers,
this
court
has
always
state
in
the
past
that
because
you
have
a
lawful
search
does
necessarily
mean
that
you
have
a
right
to
seize.
in
the
respondent's
brief,
it
is
indicated
that
they
came
across
this
particular
diary
in
the
search
for
other
items
and
we're
talking
about
cameras,
we're
talking
about
clothes
and
certain
types
of
hoods
that
the
particular
suspects
wore
during
the
commission
of
the
robbery.
even
in
people
versus
harris
which
is
probably
the
most
liberal
decision
allowing
the
police
to
search,
this
court
held
that
not
in
all
cases
will
they
allow
such
an
extensive
search.
certainly,
in
harris
they
were
looking
for
checks,
two
to
$10,000.00
checks
and
by
the
nature
of
the
search,
by
the
nature
of
the
things
that
they
were
looking
for,
it
would
require
looking
into
a
particular
drawer
or
books
or
personal
belongings.
but
what
information
the
officers
had
in
this
particular
case
did
not
require
that
type
of
search.
and
if
in
fact
they
did
and
as
concluded
by
this
court,
that
they
made
a
reasonable
search
then
it's
submitted
by
the
petitioner
that
it
was
an
unlawful
seizure.
and
boyd
versus
united
states
has
held
that
an
unlawful
search
or
an
unlawful
seizure
are
not
dependent
upon
each
other.
so
certainly,
the
petitioner
is
strongly
contending
for
that
one
item
alone
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
amato
your
honor,
we
assume
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question.
we
have
not
raised
issues
that
we
don't
think
are
extremely
material
and
relevant
or
strong
issues
so
to
speak.
we
have
raised
issues
relevant
to
the
arrest
itself
and
the
seizure
itself
and
certainly
we
wanted
the
arrest
itself,
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
the
person
that
the
officers
were
there
to
make
sure
that
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
were
before
the
court.
certainly,
it
doesn't
need
dwelling
on
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
which
the
california
supreme
court
relied
on
to
affirm
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
is
totally
different
from
the
fact
situation
in
this
case.
i
already
indicated
this
in
my
particular
brief
and
i
don't
believe
it
needs
elaboration
on
at
this
time
but
certainly
we
are
emphasizing
at
this
time
that
there
is
really
no
degree
of
consistency
with
the
fact
situation,
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
case
as
compared
to
the
case
at
bar.
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
second
point
and
that's
to
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
this
court
will
make
chimel,
people
versus
chimel
retroactive
or
not.
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
directly
comes
into
play
another
part,
another
exception,
another
area
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
to
press
their
case.
i
think
it's
another
area
that
this
court
could
reverse
in
addition
to
the
very
initial
contention
the
petitioners
made.
and
that
is
the
fact
that
chimel,
people
versus
chimel
decided
last
year
clearly
limits
the
police
to
search
a
particular
residence
and
while
many
questions
have
been
raised
as
to
how
far
the
police
are
allowed
to
search
certainly,
this
instance
where
the
particular
arrest
was
made
in
the
living
room
or
this
court
hasn't
cited
that
as
not
a
material
fact.
then
the
search
was
made
beyond
the
immediate
scope
of
the
particular
petitioner
that
i
quote,
“petitioner
because
in
fact
he
was
not
even
present
that
the
arrest
could
not
or
search
could
not
pursue
into
the
living
room,
into
drawers
and
in
fact
the
general
and
exploratory
search
to
find
evidence
of
the
crime.”
mr.
joseph
amato
this
apartment
was
a
one
bedroom,
kitchen
and
a
small
living
room
apartment,
a
four-room
apartment.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
miller
was
lying
on
the
couch.
when
the
four
policemen
came
in,
he
went
to
the
door
and
was
immediately
arrested
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
amato
it
was
found
in
the
bedroom,
in
a
small
drawer
in
the
bedroom.
mr.
joseph
amato
now,
insofar
as
retroactivity
on
this
particular
case,
certainly,
this
court
has
decided
that
it
depends
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
depending
on
the
law,
the
actual
effect
that
will
have
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
whether
or
not
it
will
serve
to
a
good
effect
on
the
past
content
of
the
courts.
now,
it
is
contended
that
the
administration
of
justice
will
be
strongly
effective
as
a
result
of
making
chimel
retroactive.
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
will
not
in
fact
be
the
case,
that
the
courts
are
extremely
flexible,
and
in
the
past,
time
and
time
again,
the
courts
on
major
counties
have
been
able
to
take
some
of
their
civil
judges
and
utilize
them
for
criminal
manners
and
this
happens
on
occasion
even
if
when
there
is
no
strong
decision
from
this
court
changing
the
particular
law.
the
petitioner
strongly
contends
that
making
chimel
retroactive
will
not
have
that
greater
effect
on
the
particular
administration
of
justice
from
the
standpoint
of
having
a
lot
of
criminals
who've
been
unconstitutionally
convicted
are
being
released.
petitioners
contended
in
his
reply
brief
that
surely
the
appeals
that
are
pending
now
could
easily
affect
the
laws
as
this
court
has
enunciated
in
people
versus
chimel.
it
seems
appropriate
that
when
you
review
the
cases
regarding
this
particular
problem
in
alaska
supreme
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
mexico
that
these
cases
have
applied
chimel
on
direct
appeals
only
and
then
when
you
review
the
cases
you
also
see
that
they
applied
to
these
particular
cases
without
opinion.
and
when
the
cases
are
not
utilizing
chimel
on
direct
appeal
that
they
seem
to
state
what
this
court
has
stated
in
stovall
versus
california
and
the
desist
case
setting
forth
the
three
criteria
that
this
court
strongly
considers
in
their
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
case
in
criminal
law
should
be
made
retroactive
or
not.
but
that
the
courts
in
fact
have
just
come
to
a
conclusion
that
when
there
is
a
constitutional
finding
before
it
that
they
review
the
facts
as
the
law
as
it
is
in
that
pending
appeal.
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
satisfied
with
the
law
of
opinion
or
justification
but
that
in
fact
it
seems
reasonable
to
those
particular
judges
that
this
case
should
be
made
as
the
law
has
stated
by
this
court
and
that
set
some
date
that
when
a
particular
case,
an
arrest
was
made
two
to
three
years
ago
and
have
all
those
particular
arrests,
then
based
upon
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional
or
not
constitutional
and
that's
immaterial
because
the
date
of
the
arrest
to
chimel,
the
date
of
seizure,
search
and
seizure
is
not
the
same
date
as
specified
in
the
pending
appeal.
this
particular
case
was
close
to
chimel.
the
petitioner
contended
at
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeal
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
law
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
i
am
referring
back
to
the
first
issue
if
i
may
was
not
constitutionally
sanctioned
to
search
even
at
that
time.
so
certainly
insofar
as
chimel
is
concerned
which
far
limits
the
courts
and
far
limits
the
courts
in
affirming
the
rights
of
the
police
officers
to
search.
it
would
be
submitted
by
this
petitioner
that
certainly
chimel
should
made
retroactive
at
least
that
the
case
is
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
answering
the
last
question
first,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
in
this
particular
case,
each
case
is
certainly
decided
by
its
own
facts.
now,
justice
frankfurter
in
dissent
in
harris
indicated
what
is
the
criteria
that
the
officers
have
when
they
make
the
particular
search.
how
far
it
can
go?
and
really,
the
decisions
aren't
that
clear.
you
can't
determine
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
unreasonable
as
far
as
the
extent
of
the
search.
now,
how
far
can
you
go?
can
you
go
upstairs?
can
you
go
to
the
third
floor,
to
the
fourth
floor?
mr.
joseph
amato
i
believe
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that
--
that
part
is
true
but
as
far
as
now
to
the
extent
of
the
search.
now,
how
could
you
make
a
search
in
a
particular
apartment
of
a
diary
when
in
fact,
even
before
they
went
to
that
particular
apartment,
they
could
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
they
didn't
know
enough
information
within
that
particularity
to
get
a
magistrate
to
sign
a
search
warrant
specifying
that
particular
diary.
the
information
that
they
have
available
did
not
include
that
information.
they
could
have
got
a
search
warrant
for
the
particular
information
that
they
knew
about
from
their
co-defendants
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
that
is
so
general
in
nature,
your
honor.
you
would
have
to
specify
what
type
of
books,
what
general
--
you're
talking
about
maybe
the
county
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
well
your
honor
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
states
in
itself
that
you
have
to
be
more
specific
than
just
to
be
so
general.
that's
why
the
general
warrant
has
been
outlawed
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i
say
that
is
insufficient
to
justify
a
search
warrant
and
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
amato
not
the
total
search
warrant.
i
think
it
will
be
justified
from
the
standpoint
of
the
parts
that
they
set
forth
with
clarity
and
it
would
extend
to
the
diary
which
would
be
illegal
at
which
if
they
brought
in
the
diary
it
would
be
insufficient
but
as
far
as
the
evidence
it
would
be
alright
as
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned.
now,
counsel
brought
out
a
fact
that
bader
who
was
in
custody
consented
to
the
officers
to
go
to
the
petitioner's
apartment.
i
think
the
california
court
simply
stated
in
my
reply
brief
that
bader
who
has
held
in
custody
does
not
have
the
authority
to
strip
the
petitioner
of
all
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
certainly
because
bader
said
he
could
go
to
that
particular
apartment
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
go
ahead,
the
officer
can
go
ahead
and
search
it
and
as
far
as
the
petitioner
contends,
an
unreasonable
search.
now,
this
point
about
this
bacca,
b-a-c-c-a.
now,
bacca
was
the
third
person
who
was
not
in
custody.
meaning
two
of
the
defendants
were
in
custody,
the
petitioner
was
not
available.
so
the
respondent
says,
there's
a
very
big
emergency
here,
“we
can't
go
back
and
get
a
search
warrant.”
well,
what
is
the
emergency
here?
what
we're
talking
about
its
four
individuals,
police
officers,
two
shotguns
would
have
already
arrested
miller.
now,
we
have
in
fact
if
they
thought
it
was
miller
then
they
have
three
of
the
four.
the
fourth
man
is
not
in
custody.
the
fourth
man
has
access
into
this
particular
place.
so
it
seemed
to
me,
that
if
they
wanted
to
get
this
particular
and
protect
the
particular
goods
that
were
in
that
apartment
and
search
it
more
in
detail
at
a
later
time,
proper
and
reasonable
police
procedure
would
be
to
have
the
officers
stay
at
the
apartment
to
survey
it
and
if
that
fourth
suspect
comes
back
then
they
can
make
the
arrest
at
that
time,
it
would
seem
that
that
would
be
an
asset
to
not
search
the
apartment
rather
than
have
to
search
it
right
away
and
be
fearful
that
this
particular
bacca
would
come
back
and
take
the
goods
from
that
particular
apartment.
now,
in
so
far
as
this
diary
and
this
is
what
the
petitioner
is
contending
at
this
time
is
completely
unreasonable.
the
other
items
that
were
searched,
the
petitioner
contends,
it
is
possible
under
rabinowitz
and
harris
that
these
items
may
have
been
able
to
been
searched
and
properly
seized
by
the
officers.
but
in
so
far
as
that
particular
diary
is
concerned,
i
think
it's
the
burden
upon
the
prosecution
when
they
are
attempting
to
make
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
particular
officer
show
enough
authority
and
enough
diligence
and
prudence
to
justify
that
particular
search
and
to
show
it
into
evidence
and
not
have
the
petitioner
show
that
he
has
the
right
supported
by
the
fourth
amendment
but
rather
have
the
prosecution
show
the
exceptions
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
amato
no,
your
honor,
i
concede
only
that
it
may
have
possibly
been.
certainly,
this
case
regarding
the
diary
to
me
seems
so
clear
cut
in
reviewing
the
case
decisions
in
rabinowitz
and
harris
and
all
the
other
decisions,
weeks
and
leftkowitz,
go-bart
company
and
reviewing
in
the
light
of
chimel,
all
these
cases
make
it
so
crystal
clear
to
myself
and
that
the
particular
seizure,
search
and
seizure
of
the
diary
was
improper.
the
most
you
can
get
i
think
is
the
search
was
valid,
the
seizure
is
difficult
to
comprehend
as
far
as,
in
light
of
the
court's
decisions
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
were
making
in
general
exploratory
search
--
mr.
joseph
amato
or
seizure.
mr.
joseph
amato
oh!
your
honor,
that's
relevant
and
material,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
joseph
amato
that's
without
a
search
warrant,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
amato
i
would
say
your
honor.
i
think
it
depends
on
circumstances.
in
the
first
instance
if
the
officers
knew
or
had
reason
or
any
evidence
or
any
probable
cause
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i'll
say
that
they
cannot
seize
that
particular
evidence
without
a
search
warrant.
i
have
no
further
question,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
be
rather
brief
in
as
much
as
this
re-argument
and
some
of
the
factual
arguments
have
been
made
by
prior
counsel
today.
i
would
like
to
briefly,
if
i
may,
go
over
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
had
a
situation
in
this
case,
where
there
was
a
robbery,
four
individuals
robbed
a
particular
residence
and
then
took
some
money,
canvas
and
some
other
personal
property.
the
day
after
the
robbery
which
was
june
4th,
the
robbery
date
being
june
4th.
on
june
5th,
two
of
the
four
accomplices
to
this
particular
robbery
were
captured
in
a
narcotics
situation.
and
they
were
captured
in
the
car
of
the
petitioner
archie
hill,
along
with
other
personal
property
that
was
recovered.
the
two
particular
individuals
that
were
captured
told
the
officers
that
archie
hill
was
one
of
the
four
participants
in
this
robbery.
they
implicated
him
to
this
particular
crime.
the
police
then
checked
out
the
association,
the
petitioner
archie
hill
with
the
other
two
participants
in
the
police
records
that
they
had
available.
they
got
the
description
of
archie
hill
which
was
approximately
5’10”,
160
lbs.
they
got
the
address
and
so
forth.
on
the
6th
of
june,
they
proceeded
to
the
residence
of
archie
hill,
the
petitioner.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
was
not
in
his
apartment.
we’re
talking
about
a
four
room
apartment,
one
bedroom.
there
was
a
mr.
miller
in
the
apartment.
the
officers
came
in
to
the
apartment
and
upon
noticing
mr.
miller,
made
an
immediate
arrest,
thereafter
shoving
miller
aside,
searching
the
other
rooms
and
finding
nothing.
at
that
time
mr.
miller
indicated
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
he
showed
the
officers
identification
showing
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
he
further
indicated
that
he
was
waiting
for
mr.
hill.
the
officers
in
this
case
did
not
ask
permission
to
search
the
premises.
thereafter,
they
spent
approximately
two
hours,
making
an
extensive
search
of
the
particular
apartment.
now,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
recover
the
personal
property,
additional
personal
property
and
the
weapons
which
included
two
knives
and
two
guns
in
the
apartment
house.
mr.
joseph
amato
the
search
took
place
after
mr.
miller
was
arrested.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
mr.
hill
was
not
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
miller
who
in
fact
was
mr.
miller
was
arrested.
he
stated
that
he
was
mr.
miller.
the
police
said
that
the
identification
meant
nothing
to
them
that
he
flipped
the
description
of
mr.
hill
exactly.
and
therefore,
they
felt
that
because
criminals
tend
to
in
many
instances,
to
avoid
arrest,
they
will
falsify
their
identification.
so
in
this
situation,
mr.
miller
was
in
fact
mr.
miller.
mr.
hill
was
not
in
the
apartment
at
all.
now,
the
search
was
very
extensive.
they
went
all
over.
and
what
they
recovered
which
is
extremely
damaging
to
the
petitioner
in
this
action
was
a
personal
diary
in
a
drawer,
in
the
dresser.
and
the
reason
why
this
particular
evidence
is
extremely
damaging
even
though
they
found
other
evidence
associated
with
the
crime,
is
because
bader
who
was
one
of
the
four
accomplices
lived
with
the
petitioner.
and
he
stated
that
he
was
involved
in
the
particular
crime.
now
the
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
that
reversed
this,
indicated
that
police
were
acting
in
good
faith
when
they
did
reverse
the
conviction.
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
there
that
could
be
argued.
that
they
were
not
exercising
good
faith
but
the
court
of
appeal
in
reversing
stated
that
the
officers
apparently
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
amato
the
trial
court
--
mr.
joseph
amato
the
trial
court
in
this
situation,
i
think
it
is
important
what
the
trial
court
said
and
what
they
were
thinking
at
that
time.
they
took
two
days
after
this
trial.
excuse
me,
after
this
matter
was
submitted
to
make
a
determination.
and
in
the
trial
record,
the
court
indicated
that
the
officers
were
acting
in
good
faith.
however,
the
court
further
indicated
that
he
realized
that
he
may
be
opening
pandora’s
box
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
was
never
intended
to
go
this
far.
now,
certainly
we
contend
strongly
right
from
the
outset
that
rabinowitz
and
harris
are
not
applicable
to
this
particular
case.
certainly,
counsel
in
the
prior
cases
have
already
indicated
this,
insofar
as
the
factual
details
of
rabinowitz
and
harris.
the
location,
the
office
in
rabinowitz,
the
public
manner
and
so
forth,
the
fact
that
a
continuing
crime
was
committed,
and
then
when
you
compare
it
to
a
particular
diary,
something
that
the
officers,
even
if
they
have
the
knowledge
of
that
diary.
even
if
they
had
plenty
of
time,
could
never
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
that
diary.
and
yet
--
mr.
joseph
amato
the
diary
was
found
in
a
dresser
drawer
in
the
bedroom.
mr.
joseph
amato
just
a
couple
of
pages,
but
they
were
the
damning
pages
implicating
the
petitioner
in
this
--
and
really
--
mr.
joseph
amato
that
is
not
clear
from
the
record
your
honor
but
it
is
just
a
couple
of
pages.
mr.
joseph
amato
your
honor,
i
didn’t
handle
this
matter
in
the
trial
level
and
the
only
reason
i
didn’t
object
was
the
same
basis
that
i
didn’t
object
to
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
kidnapping
under
in
effect
the
lindbergh
law.
and
clearly
the
facts
that
i’ve
stated
here,
do
not
indicate
any
type
of
kidnapping.
fortunately,
the
superior
court
in
san
francisco
county
has
reversed
that
to
habeas
corpus.
and
this
leaves,
i
think
possibly
to
another
matter
here
where
we
are
talking
about
the
second
degree
robbery.
here
is
an
individual
serving
the
fifth
year
in
the
state
prison
on
an
effect,
a
one
year
minimum
prison
sentence.
the
rabinowitz
case
and
the
harris
case,
i
think
when
you
review
those
cases
very
carefully,
it’s
interesting
to
know
that
they
infer
throughout
the
decision
itself
that
it
should
apply
to
those
particular
facts
in
rabinowitz
and
harris.
but
unfortunately,
this
court
did
not
see
fit
to
expressly
state
that.
and
as
a
result,
the
states
across
this
country
have
just
murdered
this
decision,
giving
it
unrealistic
results
as
far
as
this
particular
petitioner’s
contentions
concerned
are.
certainly,
the
factual
situations
when
you
put
rabinowitz
and
harris
together
come
up
with
a
situation
where
really
you
could
almost
fit,
nearly
every
factual
situation
to
a
situation
where
you
do
not
need
a
search
warrant
and
if
you
get
the
search
warrant,
you’re
better
off
without
it
because
you
can
go
further
like
in
this
particular
case,
they
never
could
have
got
any
search
warrant
for
that
diary
and
yet
because
they
have
gone
beyond
the
scope,
they’re
able
to
bring
in
this
extremely
damaging
evidence.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
in
this
particular
case
they
--
in
the
first
place,
they
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
particular
diary.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
yes
your
honor
then
there’d
be
a
strong
fifth
amendment
objection
compelling
the
particular
petitioner
to
get
evidence
of
this
sort
which
is
self
incriminating,
if
in
fact
they
knew
this
particular
evidence.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
i
think
this
is
different
than
warden
and
hayden
and
several
--
mr.
joseph
amato
i’m
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
right
your
honor
it
was.
now,
insofar
as
retroactivity
and
i
think
all
the
other
points
are
spelled
out
in
the
brief
and
since
this
is
re-argument,
i
will
at
least
reserve
until
i
hear
the
attorney
general,
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
is
concerned,
i
don’t
think
this
court
has
to
go
that
far.
i
don’t
think
and
of
course,
the
arguments
i
would
espouse
would
be
the
same
as
adequate
expressed
in
the
williams
case
that
here
is
a
case
that
is
on
direct
appeal.
that
one
of
the
differences
and
big
differences
that
i
think
this
court
should
consider
when
a
case
is
on
direct
appeal
and
one
that
is
being
attacked
collaterally
from
the
stand
point
of
retroactivity
is
the
fact
that
on
direct
appeal,
certainly
the
government
and
the
attorney
general
and
all
those
prosecutors
should
be
fully
aware
that
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
case
will
be
reversed
and
they
should
keep
their
witnesses
and
keep
their
evidence
and
keep
all
the
things
necessary
to
prosecute
the
case
again
in
advance
pending
the
possibility
of
a
reversal.
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
amato
well
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
there
to
be
any
time
limit
but
a
direct
appeal
expressly
on
the
issues
that
are
involved.
now,
i
believe
the
government
in
the
prior
case
just
mentioned
that
if
bringing
up
appeals
on
various
other
matters,
well,
not
relevant
to
the
particular
issues
that
are
involved
here.
and
then
they
come
in
on
that
way,
there
could
be
exceptions
to
that
extent.
mr.
joseph
amato
under
certain
exceptions
your
honor,
provide
he
is
unavailable.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
in
conclusion
here
at
this
time,
i
would
just
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
this
case
right
from
the
outset
was
attacked
on
the
rabinowitz
and
harris
theory
that
really
chimel
was
not
a
criteria
so
far
as
taking
this
case
up
and
that
during
the
whole
procedure
up,
it
was
a
very
difficult
question.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
it
was
difficult
was
because
of
the
expanded
critical
decisions
of
rabinowitz
and
harris
as
we
have
gone
along
in
time.
and
the
trial
court,
when
they
indicated,
they
are
open
at
pandora’s
door
was
not
as
the
attorney
general
indicates
in
this
case.
opening
a
situation
where
if
every
case,
there
is
a
person
who
is
not
in
that
particular
apartment,
then
all
of
a
sudden,
you
have
opened
the
door
in
that
area.
what
they
are
talking
about
really
was
rabinowitz
and
harris
gave
the
government
wide
latitudes
in
the
search.
now,
we
are
going
to
a
situation
where
the
person
doesn’t
even
have
to
be
there,
then
all
of
a
sudden,
you
come
to
a
situation
where
really
there
just
isn’t
going
to
be
any
exceptions
to
amount
to
a
material
reason
why
they
cannot
search
once
they
have
the
arrest.
and
i
would
submit
in
the
interest
of
justice,
particularly
in
this
case.
and
i’m
arguing
particularly
in
this
case
because
of
the
situation
where
the
equities
should
come
out
where
here,
an
individual
has
served
in
his
fifth
year
on
a
minimum
one
year
has
never
been
up
for
parole
because
he
was
convicted
of
a
kidnapping
charge
that
he
clearly
did
not
do
at
the
time.
and
the
courts
are
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
this
year,
it
was
set
aside.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor,
i’m
--
mr.
joseph
amato
it
really
is
not.
i’m
just
indicating
this
as
an
equitable
situation
when
you’re
drawing
a
very
close
line
in
this
case
because
the
trial
courts
in
california
knew
about
rabinowitz,
knew
about
harris.
the
trial
court
made
that
statement
in
the
record
at
the
time.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
3:0
against
and
it’s
just
not
that
clear
cut
of
a
case.
and
i
think
some
times
in
those
type
of
cases
the
information
like
that
might
be
helpful.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
amato
one
minute.
mr.
joseph
amato
i’d
like
to
just
hit
on
four
points
your
honor
very
briefly.
the
first
one
insofar
as
the
fifth
amendment
was
concerned,
of
course
the
problem
there,
it
is
an
involvement
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
many
respects.
the
reason
it
wasn’t
specifically
brought
out
on
appeal
is
because
it
wasn’t
objected
to
at
the
trial.
i
have
no
where
indicated
anytime
during
the
court
of
appeals,
supreme
court
or
petition,
that
this
wasn’t
a
consideration.
it
was
only
not
mentioned
because
the
trial
attorney
at
that
time
didn’t
object
the
most
particular
grounds.
mr.
joseph
amato
well,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
there
is
a
court
rule
that
you
cannot.
i
could
have
brought
it
in
--
in
effect
of
counsel.
however,
he
--
i
didn’t
think
was
--
mr.
joseph
amato
yes
your
honor.
oh,
as
far
as
the
briefing,
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct,
i
did
not.
the
second
basis
now
is
bader’s
consent.
now,
insofar
as
consent,
the
petitioner
contends
strongly
that
there
was
no
consent
given.
i
think,
the
words
in
the
transcript
are
and
i
quote
“that
he
could
go
to
petitioner’s
apartment.”
and
i
think
that’s
a
far
cry
from
giving
consent
to
search
into
drawers
in
the
bedroom.
the
third
point
that
i’d
like
to
add
is
--
mr.
joseph
amato
--
go
see
mr.
hill
and
inquire
mr.
hill
what
the
circumstances
were.
and
if
he
doesn’t
say
you
can
search
my
drawers,
or
search
my
places,
i
would
indicate
and
go
to
the
apartment
and
meet
mr.
hill
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
amato
i
would
still
say
your
honor
the
same
thing
applies.
i
think,
on
two
counts.
one
is,
he
wasn’t
given
expressed
permission
to
search.
and
secondly,
there
is
another
serious
questions
to
whether
another
person
can
give
up
the
constitutional
privacy,
another
part.
now,
insofar
as
the
amicus
curiae
brief
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
colorado
and
the
police
chiefs
across
the
country.
i
too
believe
that
this
is
a
good
case.
that
guidelines
could
be
set
as
to
what
the
police
can
and
cannot
do.
but
it
still
doesn’t
take
even
those
examples
really
go
back
to
this
particular
case.
the
examples
there
are
pretty
extreme
and
yet
that
the
attorney
general
points
out
in
colorado.
and
yet
in
all
those
cases
that
he
points
out,
those
extreme
examples
where
certainly
there
is
a
necessity
for
guidelines.
the
attorney
general
was
able
to
get
convictions
in
all
of
those
matters
expressed
even
though
they
had
to
go
and
get
the
search
warrant.
in
this
case,
i
think
it
isn’t
that
close
of
an
issue.
now
insofar
as
retroactivity
and
counsel
has
indicated
that
30
officers
in
los
angeles
will
be
required
if
it
is
made
retroactive,
the
chimel
decision.
mr.
joseph
amato
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that’s
what
i
was
alluding
to,
improperly
stated.
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
draw
some
happy
median
and
drop
it
from
maybe
30
officers
to
one
officer
on
direct
appeal.
those
cases
certainly
outnumber,
at
least
on
a
30:1
basis.
mr.
joseph
amato
then
i
ask,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
30
officers?
what
difference
does
that
basically
make?
in
other
words,
the
inference
that
i
got
and
although
i
didn’t
quite
understand
it,
if
you
need
30
officers,
on
something
that’s
already
passed,
you
don’t
need
any
officers,
what
differences
does
it
make?
i
thought
the
point
he
was
trying
to
bring
out
was
the
fact
that
if
you
make
it
completely
retroactive,
you’re
going
to
have
to
accumulate
a
lot
of
this
evidence
based
on
past
cases.
and
now,
i’m
saying
that
if
you
have
to
get
additional
man
power,
that
if
you
make
it
only
on
direct
appeals,
certainly
a
30:1
ratio
isn't
unreasonable
in
light
of
all
the
years
that
are
involved
prior
to
chimel
versus
the
cases
on
direct
appeal.
i
like
to
conclude
with
this
last
point
that
i
wasn’t
going
to
mention
until
counsel
mentioned
about
the
numbers
of
crime
and
so
forth.
i
don’t
stand
up
here
for
a
crime.
i
hope
no
attorney
or
citizen
does.
certainly,
numbers
can
be
misleading.
and
i
think
earlier
in
this
case,
i
pointed
that
out
where
the
gravity
of
this
plan
was
elevated
to
kidnapping
where
in
fact
harold
chessman
died
under
the
same
penal
code
section.
and
this
court
knows
the
facts
of
this
case
and
certainly
he
was
subjected
to
the
death
penalty
also.
and
yet,
there
would
have
been
totally
unreasonable
in
this
case.
just
as
we
indicated,
it’s
been
totally
unreasonable
to
go
into
the
bedroom
and
to
get
that
diary
and
there’s
no
indication
that
this
particular
diary
wasn’t
a
book.
the
only
evidence
and
if
it
wasn’t
a
book,
it
should
have
been
brought
out
by
the
prosecution.
the
only
evidence
is
that
there
was
two
pages
of
a
diary.
no
weapons
could
have
been
or
supposedly
no
weapons
could
have
been
within
those
two
pages.
there
is
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
it
was
anything
different
from
the
ordinary
two
sheets
of
paper.
i
would
submit
strongly
your
honor,
in
the
interest
really
of
justice
in
this
particular
case
that
this
case
--
that
this
court
reverse
the
supreme
court
and
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
amato
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
