mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
sole
issues
in
this
case
are
whether
the
search
of
petitioner's
one-bedroom
apartment
was
lawful
under
then
existing
law,
and
secondly,
if
the
search
was
not
lawful
under
present
law
as
defined
by
this
court's
decision
seven
months
ago
in
chimel
versus
california
whether
chimel
is
to
be
applied
retroactively.
the
factual
setting
in
which
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
arises
is
a
rather
unusual
one
and
i
therefore
like
to
chronicle
it
briefly.
on
june
4,
1966,
a
robbery
involving
a
brutal
assault
was
committed
by
a
gang
of
four
armed
men,
one
of
whom
was
petitioner.
as
part
of
the
series
of
robberies
committed
by
this
gang
or
we
can
say
which
this
gang
was
suspected,
in
a
particular
district
in
los
angeles.
two
days
later
after
this
robbery,
in
the
evening,
the
police
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner
and
this
is
conceded
by
petitioner
in
this
court.
i
won't
dwell
upon
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
that's
clear
and
as
i
said
conceded.
the
police
then
proceed
to
petitioner's
apartment
in
order
to
arrest
petitioner
and
to
retrieve
the
weapons
used
in
the
assault
and
robberies
and
in
order
to
retrieve
the
disguises
in
stolen
property.
in
fact,
this
is
done
with
the
consent
of
one
bader
who
is
one
of
the
members
of
the
gang,
bader
and
one
other
man
have
been
placed
in
custody
and
bader
is
petitioner's
roommate.
the
police
knock
and
identified
themselves
and
they're
confronted
by
somebody
who
later
turns
out
to
be
mr.
miller.
now,
miller
is
the
sole
occupant
of
the
apartment
at
this
time,
and
he
opens
the
door.
he
looks
almost
identical
to
petitioner.
in
fact,
the
discrepancies
are
almost
negligible,
brown
hair,
brown
eyes,
almost
the
same
height
and
weight.
in
fact,
petitioner
was
two
inches
shorter,
5'10"
instead
of
6
feet
and
he
was
10
pounds
lighter
as
well.
but
that
is
a
negligible
discrepancy
and
one
that
certainly
isn't
necessarily
apparent
to
the
officers
or
one
that
need
not
be
apparent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
think
so,
yes
because
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
state
supreme
court
all
found
that
the
officers
did
act
with
good
faith
and
i
know
this
court
has
stated
that
good
faith
is
not
a
substitute
for
probable
cause
but
of
course
there's
no
substitution
here.
there
is
ample
probable
cause.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
yes.
and
there
are
many
things
that
support
this,
this
person
in
addition
to,
is
almost
identical
physical
description.
he
suspiciously
and
evasively
denied
having
seen
any
guns
in
the
apartment
yet
when
the
officers
are
standing
outside
the
apartment
after
the
door
has
been
opened
they
see
an
automatic
and
a
loaded
clip
right
on
the
coffee
table
in
plain
view.
the
person
denies
being
petitioner
but
he's
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
for
his
presence
in
the
apartment.
he
says
he
had
some
kind
of
identification
showing
his
name
to
be
miller
but
this
doesn't
mean
much
to
the
arresting
officer
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
it's
commonly
known
and
the
trial
court
took
judicial
notice
of
this
fact
that
many
criminals
at
least
in
california
do
carry
false
identification.
it's
an
easy
thing
to
combine.
and
why
should
the
officers
believe
this
identification
when
they
--
when
he
just
lied
about
the
gun
not
knowing
there
was
a
gun
in
plain
view.
the
small
part
was
then
searched
incident
to
this
valid
but
mistaken
arrest
of
miller
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
were
searching
for
the
weapons
which
they've
been
told
would
be
at
the
apartment.
the
weapons
used
in
this
crime
and
disguises
which
they
had
heard
were
there
and
presumably
some
of
the
stolen
property
as
well
which
they
had
reason
to
believe
were
there.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
they
had
no
idea
and
it's
not
even
suggested
that
anybody
had
any
idea
there
was
such
a
diary.
i
don't
think
it's
something
we
would
assume
that
a
person
would
write,
“dear
diary,
yesterday
i
committed
a
crime.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
it
would've
happen,
we
would
submit.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
will
answer
that.
i
think
that
one
could
have
obtained
this
diary
with
a
search
warrant
in
a
following
way
by
searching
for
weapons,
for
looking
for
weapons
in
a
place
where
weapons
might
logically
be
a
bedroom,
a
dresser
drawer
opening
up
the
drawer,
seeing
the
diary
opened
to
that
current
page
and
then
going
to
use
that
information
lawfully.
why
don't
you
get
a
search
warrant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
not
gone.
but
the
officers
would've
acquired
information
lawfully
by
being
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
in
a
place
where
they
might
find
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
would
be
better
off
but
of
course
that
was
not
the
law
at
the
time
and
we
have
an
alternate
argument
that
even
under
current
law,
there
were
exigent
circumstances
here
which
would
have
not
require
the
officers
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
exigent
circumstances
were
as
follows.
the
officers
have
two
suspects
of
the
four
robbery
gang
members
in
custody.
they
knew
that
there
was
a
series
of
robbery
being
committed.
they
just
found
out
that
petitioner
was
one
of
the
men
and
this
was
after
court
hours.
there
was
a
great
likelihood
that
other
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
i'll
give
a
chronicle
if
your
honor
please.
on
june
4,
the
robbery
was
committed,
at
10:30
p.m.,
that's
a
saturday
night.
on
june
6,
monday,
at
5:30
p.m.,
the
officers
commenced
their
talk
with
baum
and
bader
who
are
in
custody.
that
talk
finishes
sometime
thereafter,
we
don't
know
exactly
when.
at
8:15,
that
same
evening,
they
go
to
the
apartment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
same
evening.
now,
there
were
two
members
of
the
gang
at
large.
we
submit
that
the
officers
did
not
have
to
wait
and
worry
about
these
fellows
committing
other
crimes.
also
the
--
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
petitioner
would
learn
of
the
fact
that
two
of
the
members
of
the
gang
have
been
taken
into
custody
and
would
remove
these
weapons
from
the
apartment.
and
finally,
what
one
could
say
well,
why
they
didn't
go
ahead
and
seized
petitioner,
arrest
him
and
then
the
next
day
go
back
to
the
search
warrant.
well,
we
have
this
fourth
member
of
the
gang
back
out
who
was
still
at
large
and
he
might
be
alerted
by
the
fact
that
these
three
members
were
placed
in
custody
and
might
remove
the
property
before
a
search
warrant
could
be
obtained.
so,
this
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
chimel
criticizes
where
the
officers
routinely
as
a
matter
of
course
dispensed
with
the
requirement
of
a
search
warrant.
chimel
itself
is
replete
with
language
recognizing
that
there
are
situations
where
a
search
without
a
search
warrant
is
justifiable
and
we
would
submit
strongly
that
this
is
one
of
those
situations.
now,
this
is
an
alternate
argument
because
we
urge
very
strongly
that
chimel
is
not
retroactive
but
in
turn
i
feel
that
the
search
passes
master
under
either
chimel
or
pre-chimel
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
officers
were
confronted
with
a
situation
where
time
was
of
the
essence.
this
gang
was
going
around
assaulting
and
robbing
people.
the
evidence
might
be
removed
from
the
apartment
if
the
other
members
of
the
gang
at
large
were
apprised
of
the
fact
that
some
of
their
members
had
been
arrested.
and
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
all
had
access
to
this
apartment
which
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
again,
in
june
--
you
know,
i
read
that
over
last
night
and
i
thought
i've
been
missing
something.
i
come
to
that
record
baum
and
bader
were
only
spoke
--
only
spoke
once
to
the
arresting
officer.
there
was
no
telling
him
and
not
telling
him
again
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
as
this
court
has
found
previously,
they
are
not
infallible
and
i
submit
this
is
a
mistake
on
their
part.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
but
i
--
i
just
last
night
looked
over
this
and
read
the
entire
record
carefully
including
the
state
court
record
and
it's
clear
that
this
officer
spoke
only
once
to
bader
and
baum
and
that
was
the
only
information
he
had
from
them,
that
he
acquired
it
5:30
on
june
the
6th.
and
i
think
these
state
findings
are
entitled
to
great
weight
where
they
are
supported
by
the
evidence
especially
regarding
the
good
faith
of
the
officers
here.
and
i
think
too
the
fact
of
judicial
notice
where
the
court
can
consider
as
evidence
these
facts
of
common
knowledge
that
the
false
identification
is
being
carried
and
that
although
the
man
was
booked
under
this
different
name
that
in
california
you're
booked
under
the
name
you
give.
so
clearly,
the
officers
did
consider
miller
to
be
hill.
now,
i
think
we
get
to
the
heart
of
the
case
here.
we
have
a
valid
arrest
and
we
assume
it's
a
valid
arrest.
now,
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
of
course,
is
permissible.
the
scope
bearing
with
the
time,
we
submit,
that
the
search
occurred,
pre-chimel
and
post-chimel.
now,
the
question
is
what
is
the
effect
of
this
mistake?
first
of
all
we'd
like
to
note
that
it's
highly
unlikely
that
upholding
this
search
would
open
up
a
pandora's
box.
the
party's
diligent
research
does
not
disclose
this
factual
situation
arising
in
any
other
state
or
federal
case.
it's
a
highly
unusual
situation
and
the
fourth
amendment
bars
only
unreasonable
searches.
now,
what
is
their
unreasonable
in
conducting
the
same
type
of
search
which
would
have
been
permissible
had
the
arrestee
in
fact
and
the
petitioner
and
the
officers
not
have
made
this
reasonable
mistake.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
not
clear.
all
that
was
introduced
are
two
pieces
of
paper.
now,
we
don't
know
if
they
were
in
notebook
form
or
what.
they
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
don't
know.
they
did
look
inside
the
book.
we
don't
know
that
there
was
a
book.
it
might
have
been
opened
like
that
if
there
were
book,
since
that
was
the
current
period.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
you
might
just
see
it.
you
might
open
up
a
drawer
and
there
it
is.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
fifth
amendment
point
is
made
somewhat
inappropriately
by
petitioner
in
this
court
because
it
was
not
at
all
raised
in
either
of
the
four
courts
in
the
state
proceedings
and
it
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
in
effect
it's
what
justice
jackson
called
the
irving
case
smuggling
in
an
issue.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
a
sealed
envelope?
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
envelope.maybe
there
would
be
a
knife
between
the
pages
of
the
book.
remember
there
were
two
knives
used.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
that
the
officers
could
look
inside
that
kind
of
envelope.
no,
not
that
it
might
at
the
present
day
law
anyway
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
under
pre-chimel
i
think
that
they
could
really
because
the
scope
was
not
restricted
and
they
can
look
for
evidence,
they
can
look
for
stolen
property
and
they
can
look
for
pretty
much
what
so
legitimate
matter
of
concern
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
basic
limitation
on
that.
i
think
the
mere
evidence
rule
being
rejected
in
warden
v.
hayden
eliminates
this
distinctions
where
we
worry
about
one
piece
of
paper
which
in
one
case
maybe
a
so-called
instrumentality
by
the
court
reaching
a
strained
application
of
that
doctrine,
save
it
from
a
mere
evidence.
i
think
that
you
can
certainly
look
inside
envelopes
under
pre-chimel
law.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
but
again
that's
not
our
situation
here.
the
officers
are
looking
only
in
places
where
a
weapon
could
reasonably
be.
now,
basically
what
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
here
in
his
attempt
to
persuade
us
that
the
search
is
unreasonable
is
an
outmoded
and
totally
inappropriate
concept
of
property
law.
he's
saying,
well
fine
the
arrest
is
alright
and
this
defendant
here,
he
had
the
control
over
the
premises
in
the
sense
of
physical
control,
he
could
go
and
grab
a
weapon.
he
could
go
run
over
to
evidence
but
he
didn't
have
control
in
a
proprietary
sense.
well,
that's
a
totally
inappropriate
standard.
i
think
that
katz
has
effectively
buried
these
distinctions
and
the
--
i
think
what
the
silverman
opinion
says
is
very
appropriate
here.
it
cautions
that
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
be
ascertained
by
resort
of
the
ancient
niceties
of
tort
or
real
property
law.
and
the
jones
case,
the
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
says
the
same
thing.
now,
i
think
the
principles
involved
in
this
case
are
graphically
illustrated
by
considering
the
following
hypothetical
situation.
let's
assume
that
miller
was
arrested
in
petitioner's
apartment
but
the
petitioner
was
right
there.
and
the
police
wanted
to
arrest
miller
that
they
knew
he
was
visiting
there.
certainly,
even
under
chimel,
the
police
could
search
the
area
within
the
reach
of
the
visitor.
the
officer
need
not
decide,
well
this
is
really
hill's
apartment
here
and
i
have
to
risk
being
shot
by
miller
who
might
grab
a
weapon,
he
has
the
right
to
a
certain
extent
invade
the
privacy
of
the
proprietor
of
these
premises.
now,
question
is
why.
well,
i
think
that
there's
a
certain
assumption
of
risk
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
here,
the
petitioner
talks
about
the
risk
that
the
invasion
of
the
petitioner's
privacy.
well,
one
takes
a
risk
in
inviting
a
visitor
on
the
premises,
just
as
one
may
risk
tort
liability
if
he
falls
over
the
carpet.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
exactly.
i
think
similarly,
if
one
gives
a
key
to
ones
apartment
to
somebody
else
or
leaves
the
door
unlock,
one
assumes
certain
risks.
maybe
a
thief
will
enter.
maybe
a
pursued
felon
will
enter
and
that's
the
situation
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
don't
know.
and
he
gave
a
very
strange
explanation.
apparently,
just
didn't
come
right
out
and
say,
“well,
i
got
in
this
way
or
so.”
he
fudged
around
a
bit
and
frazier
versus
cupp,
the
recent
opinion
of
this
court
stated
with
reference
to
the
search
of
a
duffle
bag
there.
well,
so
and
so's
roommate
didn't
have
authority
to
give
consent.
well,
the
court
said
look
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
marshall's
opinion,
“you
left
that
bag
there
in
his
custody
and
you
sort
of
assume
the
risk
that
he'd
say,
well,
look
through
the
bag.”
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
there's
nothing
to
show
that.
but
he
obviously
got
in
somehow
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
i
think
what's
interesting
is
that
absolutely
no
defense
was
offered
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
at
the
trial.
not
one
word
of
evidence
to
come
forward
and
indicate
that
this
apartment
had
been
locked
or
whatever.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
no
claim
whatsoever.
similarly,
i
think
that
if
miller's
--
miller
had
been
arrested
in
his
own
apartment,
in
miller's
apartment
and
this
had
all
been
a
mistake,
what
would
happen
if
the
officers
found
marijuana
on
miller's
pocket,
let's
say
or
in
the
drawer.
i
think
it
would
be
clearly
admissible
against
miller
despite
the
invasion
of
his
privacy,
if
it
was
a
reasonable
mistake
to
arrest
miller
and
to
search
his
premises.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
much
more
evidence
here.
it
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
mistake
and
that's
always
going
to
be
a
case
by
case
basis.
let's
say
somebody
says
it's
a
six-foot,
200-pound
blonde
who
lives
in
apartment
6
at
1931
so
and
so
drive.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
it
would
be
that
broad.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
when
there
are
exigent
circumstances
that
this
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
necessarily.
i
would
want
to
say
what
it
is
in
the
warden
versus
hayden.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
said
that
is
the
normal
rule
and
not
to
dispense
with
that,
you
would
have
to
have
exceptional
circumstances
and
normally
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
attempted
to
outline
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
there
were
other
robbers
in
this
gang
at
large
and
that
when
they
heard
that
petitioner's
confederates
were
arrested
or
that
petitioner
was
there,
then
they
would
come
and
remove
these
weapons
from
the
premises.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
an
interesting
question.
i'm
fairly
rather
pessimistic
under
california
law.
officers
have
asked
me
that.
i
don't
know
under
california
law
what
would
give
the
right
to
camp
out
in
the
apartment
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
was
no
tearing
down
of
any
door
here.
this
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
search.
they
knocked
and
identified
themselves.
they
followed
all
the
proper
rules.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
he
says,
“i
don't
have
a
loaded
revolver
and
its
right
there.”
that's
quite
a
different
situation.
and
there's
a
lot
of
other
circumstances.
in
other
words
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
could
--
they
could
not.
they
had
to
of
course
look
into
areas
where
a
person
could
be
secreted
but
we're
not
going
to
claim
the
extreme
position
that
they
could
look
inside
the
drawer,
because
obviously
a
person
can't
be
secreted
there.
so
we're
justifying
it
on
this
other
basics.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly.
let's
say
under
a
bed
or
in
the
closet
or
in
another
room.
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
that,
we
would
submit.
i
think
that
if
the
court
would
conclude
otherwise,
you
know
any
felon
could
frustrate
an
arrest
and
search.
all
he'd
have
to
do
is
say,
“i'm
not
the
defendant.
i'm
not
the
man
you're
looking
for”
and
especially
if
he
has
phony
id.
then
what
does
the
officer
have
to
do.
then
he
would
stopped
as
a
matter
of
law
from
continuing,
he
would
have
to
go
away
and
find
some
100%
proof
that
this
in
fact
was
the
criminal
and
then
perhaps
the
evidence
could
be
removed.
this
would
really
give
the
criminal
a
veto
power
over
every
search.
he
just
have
to
claim,
“i'm
not
the
man.”
now,
go
prove
it.
now,
i
won't
discuss
this
purported
issue
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
pointed
to
that
it
was
deliberately
waived,
i
think,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
alright.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
i
--
i
certainly
don't.
i
think
that
gullett
itself.
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
gullett
said,
there
is
no
special
sanctity
and
papers
as
distinguished
from
other
forms
of
property
to
render
them
immune
from
search
and
seizure
if
only
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
principles
of
the
cases
in
which
other
property
may
be
seized.
so
then
we
have
warden
v.
hayden
dispensing
with
this
mere
evidence
rule.
now,
if
we
allow
confessions
from
a
man's
lips.
we
allow
blood
to
be
taken
from
his
veins
without
a
warrant
under
schmerber.
is
paper
more
sacred
than
this?
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
its
testimonial
in
a
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
not
testimonial
in
a
compulsive
sense.
i
think
that's
what
essential.
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
safeguard
against
compulsory
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
i
think
is
equally
testimonial
and
it's
probably
a
lot
more
compulsive.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
as
if
to
the
extent
that
one
would
assume
it
to
be
testimonial,
blood
is
certainly
as
much
though
i
would
think
but
this
court
has
ruled
at
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
can't
see
a
distinction
though
if
we
uphold
that
in
schmerber,
i
think
we
have
to
uphold
it
here
and
i
think
it's
like
a
spy's
paper
where
we
say
spy's
papers
enable,
those
are
instrumentalities
but
the
same
papers
are
mere
evidence
or
political
assassins'
notebooks,
are
those
instrumentalities
or
are
they
mere
evidence.
i
think
we
could
get
into
an
awful
lot
of
problems
in
this
situation.
finally,
i
have
only
about
three
or
four
minutes,
i'd
like
to
note
our
views
on
the
retroactivity
issue.
i
think
it's
significant
--
first
of
all,
under
chimel,
i
try
to
indicate
the
exigent
circumstances
and
then
it
was
after
court
hours
and
the
time
was
of
the
essence
but
we
would
submit
that
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
and
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
file
a
letter
a
listing
recent
decisions
on
the
question
of
retroactivity
if
i
might
do
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
it's
giving
citations
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
i
did
this
morning.
i've
indicated
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
have
it
from
the
horse's
mouth
that
it's
chimel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
although
there
have
been
five
or
six
variance
of
the
pronunciation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
according
to
mr.
chimel.
yes.
there
are
three
federal
circuits
and
five
states
that
have
held
that
chimel
is
fully
prospective.
it
applies
only
to
searches
conducted
after
the
date
of
that
decision.
in
alaska,
new
mexico
where
the
only
jurisdictions
that
have
decided
to
the
contrary,
we
submit
that
desist
is
the
governable
standard
here.
desist
set
forth
the
function
of
the
three
considerations,
the
purpose
to
be
served,
the
extent
of
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
chimel
stresses
in
footnote
12
that
the
fourth
amendment's
purpose
is
to
prevent
not
simply
to
redress
unlawful
police
action.
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
help
deter
illegal
police
conduct
to
punish
in
effect
police
and
prosecutors
who
would
justifiably
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
of
many
years
standing
and
conducted
searches
in
total
compliance
with
those
standards.
we're
not
talking
about
unreliable
or
false
evidence.
it's
only
a
procedural
question
not
affecting
the
issue
the
guilt
or
innocence.
so
in
effect,
and
certainly
the
extent
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
is
clear,
this
court
two
years
before
chimel
and
one
year
after
the
present
search
in
the
cooper
case
quoted
that
statement
in
rabinowitz
that
has
since
been
disapproved
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
within
three
weeks
of
the
decision
in
chimel,
70%
of
the
states
joined
respondents
in
a
petitioning
for
rehearing
and
this
shows
the
impact
of
this
decision
and
it's
been
evident
to
me
in
going
around
explaining
the
police
officers.
they
regard
this
as
a
greater
impact
than
miranda.
they
regard
this
as
a
greatest
impact
on
their
day
to
day
enforcement
techniques
of
any
decision
that
has
come
down
in
the
criminal
field
in
recent
years
and
the
memorandum
which
is
attached
to
this
letter
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
court
shows
how
that
court
has
had
to
completely
revise
its
procedures
and
place
judges
on
call
nights
and
weekends
to
issue
search
warrants
because
of
chimel.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
would
be
an
enormous
impact
on
the
courts
in
requiring
them
to
retry
a
multitude
of
cases
decided
in
reliance
on
chimel
and
if
there
is
any
case
in
which
this
court
still
believes
that
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
should
be
applied
prospectively,
this
is
certainly
the
case
under
the
standards
which
this
court
has
held.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
know.
i
believe
it
was
your
honor
in
that
footnote
12
in
desist
to
note
that
it
can't
be
unreasonable
if
that
was
the
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
we
certainly
concur
with
that.
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
not
in
view
of
the
particular
wording
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
searches
are
to
be
judged
in
light
of
their
reasonableness
and
that
certainly
must
imply
what
the
law
is
at
the
time
the
search
was
conducted.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
that's
all
we
have
unless
there
are
any
questions.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
is
a
re-argument
in
a
direct
appeal
from
a
state
conviction.
the
sole
issues
in
this
case
involve
the
search
and
seizure
which
occurred
in
the
petitioner’s
apartment
in
1966.
and
beside
from
the
issue
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
chimel
decision
there
are
two
or
three
issues
involving
the
legality
of
the
search
under
pre-chimel
law.
before
reaching
these
issues
however
i’d
like
to
quickly
dispose
off
the
new
element
that
petitioner
has
injected
into
the
case,
namely
this
collateral
proceeding
in
the
california
courts
whereby
i
believe
within
a
month
previously,
the
kidnapping
count
was
set
aside
but
that
was
on
a
state
law
ground
and
that
is
not
even
a
final
judgment
that
is
being
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
must
lead
to
this
state,
sometime
within
the
last
month,
i
believe
it
was,
and
that’s
not
even
final
yet
and
frankly
i
don’t
see
any
bearing
on
it.
the
kidnapping
count
is
gone
but
the
robbery
counts
which
carry
a
maximum
of
life
imprisonment
remain.
in
fact,
although
petitioner’s
minimum
is
one
year
since
that
time
not
applicable
to
him,
the
statute
provides
for
a
15
year
minimum
whereas
here,
there
is
a
bodily
injury
to
the
victim.
so
that’s
really
something
collateral.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
so
basically,
getting
to
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
i
would
like
to
again
outline
the
facts,
although
counsel
has
because
they
are
a
bit
confusing
and
i
don’t
think
a
complete
statement
has
been
given.
on
saturday,
june
4th,
1966,
a
robbery
is
committed,
involving
a
brutal
assault
and
unnecessary
assault
by
gang
of
fur
armed
men.
one
of
whom
is
petitioner
and
this
is
part
of
a
series
of
robberies
in
the
san
fernando
valley
area
of
los
angeles.
now,
two
days
later,
the
police
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
and
petitioner
at
page
10
of
his
opening
brief
really
concedes
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
so
there’s
no
need
to
dwell
in
detail
on
that.
what
the
police
do
is
they
proceed
to
petitioner’s
apartment.
they
do
not
have
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant.
they
go
in
order
to
seize
the
weapons
and
the
stolen
property
that’s
involved
with
the
robbery
in
the
present
case.
and
this
is
even
arguably
done
with
the
consent
of
the
one
of
the
other
robbery
gang
members
who
is
in
custody.
but
that
is
not
central
to
the
case.
the
police
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
mr.
bader.
he
is
one
of
the
four
men,
baum
and
bader
were
arrested.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
has
told
them
about
this
and
they
have
independent
information
in
their
files
connecting
petitioner
with
these
two
men
and
with
the
series
of
robberies
in
that
area.
so
the
police
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
roommate,
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
stated
that
arguably
he
did
because
he
said
“you
can
go
to
the
apartment.”
and
that’s
where
the
loot
is
and
the
weapons
are.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
isn’t.
no,
although
i
noted
briefly
in
our
respondents
brief
that
we
don’t
think
that’s
dispositive,
the
fact
that
that
was
not
a
ground
upheld
by
the
appellate
court.
i
just
injected
that
that
we
seek
to
uphold
the
validity
of
the
search
on
other
grounds.
now,
what
the
police
do
is
they
knocked
and
they
identified
themselves
and
they’re
confronted
by
a
man
who
opens
the
door
and
who
looks
exactly
like
petitioner
hill.
and
they
have
descriptions
of
petitioner
hill
from
the
victims
of
which
there
were
three.
although
not
all
of
them
gave
full
description.
but
they
have
general
descriptions
and
they
have
of
course
a
description
from
petitioner’s
roommate
and
they
have
their
own
information
from
their
files
involving
previous
arrest
of
petitioner.
so
they
go
there
and
there
is
a
man
who
the
record
bader
indicates
is
only
10
lbs
off
in
weight
and
2
inches
in
height.
and
these
are
discrepancies
which
would
not
necessarily
be
apparent
to
the
officers
and
could
be
accounted
for
by
any
--
let’s
say
ambiguity
in
the
victim’s
description.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
so
i
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
affirm
the
validity
of
the
arrest
as
such.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
and
of
the
arrest
as
such,
they
had
a
rather
curious
approach
to
the
legality
of
the
search
which
i’ll
mention
in
passing.
now,
what
happens
is
before
the
officers
even
enter
the
apartment,
they
see
a
gun
with
a
loaded
clip
in
plain
view
from
the
threshold
to
the
apartment
sitting
on
the
coffee
table.
they
asked
this
man,
what
do
you
know
about
guns
being
on
the
premises?
he
says
“i
don’t
know
about
guns
being
on
the
premises.”
well
what
about
this
one?
you
know,
this
already
certainly
alerts
them
as
to
evasive
conduct
by
the
person
they
suspect
being
the
member
of
the
robbery
gang.
so,
he
is
also
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
for
this
presence.
he
is
asked
how
did
he
get
in
here,
“well,
i
don’t
know,
i
just
got
in
here.”
where
is
petitioner
hill?
“oh,
i
don’t
know
where
he
is,
you
know.”
so,
then
he
says
“i’m
miller
and
i’ve
got
identification
to
prove
it.”
but
are
the
officers
supposed
to
believe
that
when
he
tells
them
he
doesn’t
know
anything
without
a
gun
in
plain
sight?
so
they
are
entitled
--
as
justice
black
stated
in
a
previous
argument
today
to
assume
that
the
person
who
opens
the
door
especially
when
he
matches
the
tenant’s
description
is
the
person
in
control.
now,
this
is
where
the
divergence
begins
in
the
treatment
of
the
case
between
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
state
supreme
court.
the
court
of
appeal
adopted
the
approach
suggested
by
petitioner
that
somehow
what
is
important
in
ascertaining
the
legality
of
a
search
is
not
the
dominion
and
control
of
the
person
over
the
premises,
in
a
physical
sense
but
at
somehow
his
proprietary
control
that
matters.
well,
this
is
a
concept
that
i
believe
this
court
has
rejected
time
and
time
again
in
the
jones
case,
silverman
case
and
i
think
finally
buried
in
the
katz
case.
that
the
right
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
whatever
its
scope
does
not
depend
upon
proprietary
matters
but
rather
upon
the
physical
dominion
and
control
because
after
all,
it’s
for
the
officer’s
protection.
and
i
think
that
katz
indicates
that
clearly,
we’re
concerned
with
the
ability
of
the
person
to
grab
a
weapon,
all
of
these
cases
indicate
this
is
the
consideration.
now,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
that
miller
did.
we
have
never
made
that
contention.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that
is
the
case,
not
that
miller,
no.
miller
did
not.
now,
hearing
the
arguments
in
the
white
case
involving
electronic
surveillance
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
katz
decision
has
its
one
of
its
facets
of
the
protection
of
the
right
to
privacy,
a
concern
really
with
assuming
a
risk
of
invasion
of
privacy
and
i
think
that’s
really
the
key
to
this
aspect
of
this
case.
the
risk
that
the
public
will
have
access
to
the
person’s
words
or
his
property.
if
you
leave
that
telephone
booth
door
open,
it’s
a
different
matter.
if
you
leave
your
front
door
open
or
if
you
invite
people
into
your
premises
that’s
a
different
matter
and
that’s
exactly
what
we
think
is
the
case
here.
there
is
a
certain
assumption
of
the
risk
by
having
visitors
in
your
apartment.
if
you
invite
the
visitor
in,
let’s
say
hill
had
been
there
and
they
had
come
to
arrest
miller.
it
was
hill’s
place.
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
miller
had
no
proprietary
control
over
the
premises,
it
would
mean
that
the
officers
would
have
to
say
“we’re
not
going
to
search
here
because
we’re
invading
hill’s
privacy.”
i
think
that
miller
could’ve
grabbed
a
weapon
of
a
drawer
next
to
him
even
under
the
chimel
scope
and
injured
the
officer.
so
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i’m
curious
about
it
myself
and
i
have
no
idea
from
the
record
or
from
any
other
source.
all
i
know
is
that
he
was
asked
for
an
explanation.
he
was
unable
to
give
one
apparently.
now,
i
think
that
the
stoner
opinion
itself
recognizes
that
apparent
authority
can
provide
the
basis
for
searching
even
when
there
is
a
mistake.
now,
i
think
what’s
important
here
is
that
if
you
assume
that
hill
was
there,
the
search
that
took
place
was
totally
proper.
it
was
a
type
of
search
that
would
have
been
permissible
under
pre-chimel
law
and
the
fact
that
this
mistake
occurred
in
good
faith
should
make
no
difference
and
the
treatment
of
it.
otherwise,
certainly
any
felon
could
frustrate
any
search
by
claiming
to
be
somebody
other
than
the
petitioner
and
unless
the
officer
had
personally
seen
them,
that
would
just
automatically
preclude
further
search.
and
i
think
that
frazier
versus
cupp
also
speaks
in
terms
of
assumption
of
the
risk
as
far
as
the
scope
of
permissible
search.
now,
one
thing
i
would
like
to
get
in
to,
after
concluding
now
that
the
scope
of
the
search
was
unexceptional.
the
items
being
found
in
the
bedroom
is
this
question
of
the
diary.
i
think,
other
than
that,
there
can’t
be
any
particular
novelty
to
this
case
under
pre-chimel
law.
now,
first
of
all,
we’d
like
to
state
strenuously
that
we
believe
that
issue
is
improperly
raised
before
this
court.
it’s
been
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
not
on
this
ground.
no,
in
fact,
perhaps
the
making
of
an
objection
on
other
grounds
is
affirmatively
indicative
of
the
waiver
of
an
objection
on
this
ground.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
to
all
of
the
evidence
in
general.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
that
language
does
appear.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
of
the
objection.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that
can
really
be
dispositive
of
the
issue
or
even
that
significant.
because
after
all,
if
we
look
at
the
purpose
of
an
objection,
it’s
to
appraise
opposing
counsel
and
the
trial
court
of
the
basis
for
the
objection
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
say
particularly
not
in
view
of
the
novel
nature
of
this
allegation
because
i
know
of
no
cases
under
california
law
or
under
federal
law
applicable
to
the
states
where
it
has
been
held
that
because
this
is
a
document,
that
alone
bars
its
admission
and
evidence.
so
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
objections.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
the
diary
can
be
found
at
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
on
page
41
itself.
it
is
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
concluded
a
damning
account
of
petitioner’s
involvement
really.
it’s
a
rather
unusual
thing,
it
relates
the
fact
of
the
robbery
and
some
of
this
is
in
criminal
jargon
but
in
effect
some
of
the
members
of
the
gang
including
petitioner
went
to
tj,
that’s
tijuana
and
scored
7k’s
which
means
purchasing
seven
kilos
of
marijuana.
and
that
when
they
came
back,
they
went
to
bed
and
then
couple
of
them
went
out
to
get
something
to
eat
and
then
“this
turned
out
to
be
mistake
because
they
got
busted.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s
correct.
made
under
absolutely
no
compulsion
whatsoever,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
criminals
do
not
customarily
confess
their
crimes
with
the
introductory
phrase
“dear
diary,
yesterday
i
did
so
and
so.”
this
is
something
that
is
totally
volunteered
and
that
brings
me
really
to
the
merits
of
this
claim
of
a
fifth
amendment
basis,
let
me
just
state
briefly
though
this
was
not
raised
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
not
at
the
trial
court,
not
at
the
court
of
appeal,
not
the
supreme
court
of
california,
not
even
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
so
under
the
cardinal
versus
louisiana
decision
and
this
rule
40
of
this
court’s
rules,
i
think
that
precludes
it
but
on
the
merits,
i
think
that
guled
itself
who’s
mere
evidence
rule
was
at
least
to
a
very
substantial
degree
rejected
in
warden
v.
hayden
precludes
the
claim
made
here.
and
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
a
certain
extent
it
was.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
this
i
think
is
dispositive,
the
following
sentence
if
i
may
note
from
guled
itself.
there
is
no
special
sanctity
in
papers
as
distinguished
forms
of
property
to
render
them
in
unit
from
search
and
seizure
if
only
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
principles
of
the
cases
in
which
other
property
maybe
seized.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
clothing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
that
language
in
conjunction
with
whatever
this
court
would
want
to
do
in
the
future
certainly
leaves
the
court
open
to
hold
the
documents
are
in
a
special
class.
my
only
statement
is
that
guled
in
effect
said,
there
is
a
mere
evidence
rule
and
it’s
not
because
of
documents.
documents
and
clothing,
everything
is
the
same
way.
so
once
this
court
in
warden
dealt
narrowly
with
the
issue
before
it,
namely
non
documentary
evidence,
i
think
that
by
the
weight
of
that
language,
despite
the
reservation
of
the
questions--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true
and
if
it
is
testimonial
however,
it
is
not
under
any
compulsion.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
i
hardly
view
that
as
the
test.
i
think
the
test
is
of
course
whether
this
was
given
under
any
compulsion
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
don’t
think
that
the
compulsion
goes
to
the
manner
in
which
the
document
was
acquired
by
the
police.
i
think
the
compulsion
goes
to
the
making
of
the
statement
and
of
course
when
the
statement
was
made,
it
bears
all
the
indicia
of
reliability.
here’s
a
man
in
his
own
apartment
writing
down
his
own
thoughts,
events
of
the
day.
so
i
think
that
there’s
no
compulsion
whatsoever.
it’s
not
as
if
the
officer
had
said,
“you’re
under
arrest.
now
write
down
what
you’ve
done
the
last
24
hours.
now,
some
question
was
raised
at
the
previous
argument
about
why
the
officers
looked
to
this
diary.
well,
i
stated
that
hypothetically,
the
police
might
have
been
concerned
with
finding
a
weapon
or
some
contraband
there
and
i
think
that
the
events
of
the
last
day
or
two,
give
some
way
to
my
hypothetical.
it
was
interesting
to
read
in
the
washington
post
yesterday
about
a
man
who
attempted
to
escape
from
death
row
in
chicago,
and
had
in
a
hallowed
out
book
of
the
collected
works
of
edgar
allen
poke
a
pistol.
and
he
succeeded
i
believe
in
wounding
some
of
the
guards
and
there’s
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
to
that
extent
it
would
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
in
all
fairness,
i
must
say
they
did
not
uphold
this
on
the
consent
issue,
they
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
was
a
footnote
in
there
opinion
and
that
can
be
found
in
the
appendix
on
page
76,
footnote
2
that
the
consent
issue
would
not
be
decided
by
that
court
because
the
facts
surrounding
it
whether
it
was
not
a
mere
submission
to
authority,
not
bound
up
with
unlawful
conduct
were
never
developed.
so,
in
other
words,
the
supreme
court
of
california
chose
to
uphold
the
search
on
grounds
other
than
consent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
chimel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that
is
it
and
this
issue
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
on
the
diary,
i
would
like
to
add
a
couple
more
comments.
first
of
all,
schmerber
itself
notes
the
shift
in
the
fourth
amendment
view
from
property
to
persons
and
their
right
of
privacy.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
anywhere,
not
anywhere
from
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
none
whatsoever.
not
even
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
for
the
very
first
time
of
the
opening
brief,
i
would
like
to
note
one
thing
perhaps
a
little
bit
collaterally
but
the
enormous
effect
of
any
ruling
by
this
court
holding
that
papers
are
somehow
sacrosanct
was
brought
home
to
me
recently
working
on
the
preparation
of
this
sirhan
sirhan
case
involving
the
diary
of
a
political
assassin.
i
think
that
if
there
somehow
is
going
to
be
a
special
rule
for
papers
that
the
court
has
to
be
fully
aware
of
the
ramifications
of
this
giving
special
treatment
to
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
cover
one
aspect
of
the
search
before
getting
to
the
retroactivity
question.
namely
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
under
chimel
because
we
do
not
in
any
way
feel
that
the
retroactivity
issue
is
dispositive
of
this
case
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
chimel
and
the
cases
upon
which
it
relies
have
held
that
the
requirement
for
the
search
warrant
should
not
routinely
be
dispensed
with.
but
that
word
is
impracticable
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
that
one
need
not
to
be
obtained
and
this
is
precisely
a
case
that
comes
within
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
chimel.
in
chimel
of
course,
the
officers
had
weeks
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
here,
let’s
look
at
the
chronology
leading
up
to
the
search.
the
offense
was
committed
late
on
a
saturday
night
only
after
5:30
pm
on
the
following
monday,
two
days
later
that
the
officers
require
their
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
this
was
after
court
hours.
they
would
have
had
to
wait
well
over
12
hours
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
perhaps
more.
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
first
tuesday
in
california
at
least
is
a
court
holiday
in
the
month
of
june
in
election
year.
so,
this
really
might
be
a
36
hour
wait,
instead
of
a
12
hour
wait.
now,
was
there
any
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
wait
this
day
or
two?
well,
the
officers
knew
that
there
was
a
fourth
member
of
the
robbery
gang
at
large.
this
gang
was
armed
and
dangerous.
they
had
committed
several
other
robberies
in
the
area.
the
officers
knew
that
the
weapons
and
the
stolen
property
were
at
petitioner’s
apartment.
thus
time
was
of
the
essence.
the
officers
were
confronted
with
what
was
very
close
to
a
hot
pursuit
situation.
and
there
were
these
reasons
for
not
delaying
the
search
until
the
search
warrant
could
be
obtained.
petitioner
and
the
fourth
member
of
the
gang,
(inaudible)
were
at
large
and
they
could
still
be
committing
other
assaults
and
robberies.
secondly,
the
arrest
of
two
members
of
the
gang,
just
two-and-a-half
hours
before
the
search
here,
might
alert
petitioner
to
flee
from
his
apartment
and
perhaps
from
the
jurisdiction.
and
thirdly,
if
petitioner
were
arrested
that
evening
and
then
search
of
the
apartment
delayed
another
day
or
two,
that
fourth
man
back
--
might
have
come
back
being
alerted
by
petitioner’s
arrest
or
the
arrest
of
the
two
other
man
bader
and
baum
and
realized
that
the
officers
would
have
seen
incriminating
evidence
when
they
arrested
petitioner
and
then
might
have
removed.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
petitioner?
he
was
arrested
about
thursday
or
friday
of
that
week
but
that
is
not
on
the
record.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
they
didn’t
know
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
there
was
--
i
don’t
know
if
there
was
a
warrant
or
not.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it’s
a
great
interest
to
me
to
but
it’s
no
where
in
the
record,
not
even
in
the
local
courts
record.
now,
i
think
any
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
it’s
significant
that
the
officers
knew
that
both
guns
in
the
robbery
and
all
of
the
remaining
stolen
property
were
on
these
premises
and
that
these
were
armed
and
dangerous
men
and
they
had
to
act
quickly.
now,
i
won’t
go
into
it
in
detail
but
the
problem
of
exigent
circumstances
is
graphically
demonstrated
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
the
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement.
they
demonstrate
the
practical
necessities
for
having
a
meaningful
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
the
chimel
rule.
the
brief
that
that
organization
has
filed,
details
a
couple
of
presently
pending
cases
where
the
murder
weapon
itself
was
disposed
off,
during
the
time
that
the
officers
sought
to
comply
with
chimel
and
went
out
to
try
and
get
the
search
warrant.
now,
one
related
problem
of
course
is
what
can
be
done
to
secure
the
premises
and
that’s
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
and
in
california,
our
view
is
that
the
premises
cannot
be
secured
to
the
extent
that
people
who
are
not
involved
in
criminal
conduct
are
restrained,
their
movements
are
followed
around
the
house.
perhaps
a
matron
has
to
come
because
the
wife
of
the
petitioner
is
there,
she
wants
to
use
the
facilities.
she
could
dispose
off
evidence,
you
have
to
have
an
armada
men
and
equipment
there
to
follow
everybody
around
the
house.
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
about
that.
and
that
is
what
has
been
most
difficult
to
leave
with,
under
the
chimel
decision.
now
as
far
as
retroactivity
is
concerned,
we
detailed
our
views
in
the
brief
and
i
think
it’s
important
of
course
to
apply
a
fully
prospective
test
to
the
chimel
decision.
the
purpose
of
the
decision
of
course
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
that’s
not
going
to
be
deterred
by
punishing
police
officers
for
what
they
did
relying
on
the
existing
law
as
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago.
and
up
to
two
or
three
years
ago,
specifically
at
the
time
this
search
was
conducted.
there
certainly
has
been
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
of
a
retroactive
application
of
this
chimel
decision
would
be
i
submit
greater
than
the
effect
of
any
decision
of
this
court
on
the
administration
of
justice.
just
thousands
of
prisoners
would
be
sent
back
for
new
trials
and
only
questionably
could
be
retried.
and
i’d
like
to
launch
with
the
court
an
original
and
ten
copies
of
a
memorandum
which
i
have
provided
petitioner
here,
a
manhour
cost
study
regarding
the
chimel
decision.
and
that
report
is
very
significant
in
indicating
that
annually,
the
chimel
decision
will
cost
the
los
angeles
police
department
alone
an
additional
86,000
manhours.
and
the
monetary
cost
is
close
to
half-a-million
dollars.
and
that
is
just
for
police
officers,
not
the
clerical
help
and
the
equipment
that
this
is
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
is
what
i’m
referring
to,
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
get
search
warrants.
it’s
a
very
involved
process.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
obtain
search
warrants,
that’s
all
that
i’m
talking
about
here
to
draw
of
affidavits.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
could
i
prevail
upon
the
court
for
an
additional
minute?
and
this
is
just
the
cost
to
police
officers.
not
clerical,
personnel.
now,
this
i
believe
averages
out
to
about
30
extra
police
officers
for
the
city
of
los
angeles
a
year
because
of
this.
and
consequently,
one
can
imagine
the
retroactive
application
of
this.
and
what
i
would
like
to
note
in
conclusion
as
far
as
the
impact
of
this
decision
is
that,
this
strikes
at
the
most
sensitive
nature
of
police
work.
the
type
of
property
crime,
burglaries
particularly
where
the
rate
of
recovery
is
lowest
it
might
be
of
interest
to
your
honors
to
note
that
less
than
10%
of
stolen
property
is
recovered.
now,
when
the
time
that
takes
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
each
case
which
is
several
hours
is
multiplied
by
the
hundreds
of
situations,
every
day
that
occurred
necessitating
one
under
the
chimel
decision,
one
can
see
the
impact
of
this
decision.
one
can
easily
point
to
one
case
or
at
the
other
case
and
say
a
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
here.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
overall
impact,
it’s
quite
apparent
with
two
million
burglaries
being
committed
annually
in
this
country,
265,000
of
them
in
california.
that
there
is
indeed
a
real
problem
of
just
not
getting
slowed
under
by
police
work.
so
for
these
reasons,
we
would
submit
very
strongly
that
the
date
of
prospectivity
should
be
adopted
that
all
searches
conducted
previous
to
the
date
of
chimel,
not
be
governed
by
the
rule
of
that
decision
and
we
urge
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
is
lawful
in
all
respects.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
sole
issues
in
this
case
are
whether
the
search
of
petitioner's
one-bedroom
apartment
was
lawful
under
then
existing
law,
and
secondly,
if
the
search
was
not
lawful
under
present
law
as
defined
by
this
court's
decision
seven
months
ago
in
chimel
versus
california
whether
chimel
is
to
be
applied
retroactively.
the
factual
setting
in
which
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
arises
is
a
rather
unusual
one
and
i
therefore
like
to
chronicle
it
briefly.
on
june
4,
1966,
a
robbery
involving
a
brutal
assault
was
committed
by
a
gang
of
four
armed
men,
one
of
whom
was
petitioner.
as
part
of
the
series
of
robberies
committed
by
this
gang
or
we
can
say
which
this
gang
was
suspected,
in
a
particular
district
in
los
angeles.
two
days
later
after
this
robbery,
in
the
evening,
the
police
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner
and
this
is
conceded
by
petitioner
in
this
court.
i
won't
dwell
upon
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
that's
clear
and
as
i
said
conceded.
the
police
then
proceed
to
petitioner's
apartment
in
order
to
arrest
petitioner
and
to
retrieve
the
weapons
used
in
the
assault
and
robberies
and
in
order
to
retrieve
the
disguises
in
stolen
property.
in
fact,
this
is
done
with
the
consent
of
one
bader
who
is
one
of
the
members
of
the
gang,
bader
and
one
other
man
have
been
placed
in
custody
and
bader
is
petitioner's
roommate.
the
police
knock
and
identified
themselves
and
they're
confronted
by
somebody
who
later
turns
out
to
be
mr.
miller.
now,
miller
is
the
sole
occupant
of
the
apartment
at
this
time,
and
he
opens
the
door.
he
looks
almost
identical
to
petitioner.
in
fact,
the
discrepancies
are
almost
negligible,
brown
hair,
brown
eyes,
almost
the
same
height
and
weight.
in
fact,
petitioner
was
two
inches
shorter,
5'10"
instead
of
6
feet
and
he
was
10
pounds
lighter
as
well.
but
that
is
a
negligible
discrepancy
and
one
that
certainly
isn't
necessarily
apparent
to
the
officers
or
one
that
need
not
be
apparent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
think
so,
yes
because
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
state
supreme
court
all
found
that
the
officers
did
act
with
good
faith
and
i
know
this
court
has
stated
that
good
faith
is
not
a
substitute
for
probable
cause
but
of
course
there's
no
substitution
here.
there
is
ample
probable
cause.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
yes.
and
there
are
many
things
that
support
this,
this
person
in
addition
to,
is
almost
identical
physical
description.
he
suspiciously
and
evasively
denied
having
seen
any
guns
in
the
apartment
yet
when
the
officers
are
standing
outside
the
apartment
after
the
door
has
been
opened
they
see
an
automatic
and
a
loaded
clip
right
on
the
coffee
table
in
plain
view.
the
person
denies
being
petitioner
but
he's
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
for
his
presence
in
the
apartment.
he
says
he
had
some
kind
of
identification
showing
his
name
to
be
miller
but
this
doesn't
mean
much
to
the
arresting
officer
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
it's
commonly
known
and
the
trial
court
took
judicial
notice
of
this
fact
that
many
criminals
at
least
in
california
do
carry
false
identification.
it's
an
easy
thing
to
combine.
and
why
should
the
officers
believe
this
identification
when
they
--
when
he
just
lied
about
the
gun
not
knowing
there
was
a
gun
in
plain
view.
the
small
part
was
then
searched
incident
to
this
valid
but
mistaken
arrest
of
miller
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
were
searching
for
the
weapons
which
they've
been
told
would
be
at
the
apartment.
the
weapons
used
in
this
crime
and
disguises
which
they
had
heard
were
there
and
presumably
some
of
the
stolen
property
as
well
which
they
had
reason
to
believe
were
there.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
they
had
no
idea
and
it's
not
even
suggested
that
anybody
had
any
idea
there
was
such
a
diary.
i
don't
think
it's
something
we
would
assume
that
a
person
would
write,
“dear
diary,
yesterday
i
committed
a
crime.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
it
would've
happen,
we
would
submit.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
will
answer
that.
i
think
that
one
could
have
obtained
this
diary
with
a
search
warrant
in
a
following
way
by
searching
for
weapons,
for
looking
for
weapons
in
a
place
where
weapons
might
logically
be
a
bedroom,
a
dresser
drawer
opening
up
the
drawer,
seeing
the
diary
opened
to
that
current
page
and
then
going
to
use
that
information
lawfully.
why
don't
you
get
a
search
warrant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
not
gone.
but
the
officers
would've
acquired
information
lawfully
by
being
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
in
a
place
where
they
might
find
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
would
be
better
off
but
of
course
that
was
not
the
law
at
the
time
and
we
have
an
alternate
argument
that
even
under
current
law,
there
were
exigent
circumstances
here
which
would
have
not
require
the
officers
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
exigent
circumstances
were
as
follows.
the
officers
have
two
suspects
of
the
four
robbery
gang
members
in
custody.
they
knew
that
there
was
a
series
of
robbery
being
committed.
they
just
found
out
that
petitioner
was
one
of
the
men
and
this
was
after
court
hours.
there
was
a
great
likelihood
that
other
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
i'll
give
a
chronicle
if
your
honor
please.
on
june
4,
the
robbery
was
committed,
at
10:30
p.m.,
that's
a
saturday
night.
on
june
6,
monday,
at
5:30
p.m.,
the
officers
commenced
their
talk
with
baum
and
bader
who
are
in
custody.
that
talk
finishes
sometime
thereafter,
we
don't
know
exactly
when.
at
8:15,
that
same
evening,
they
go
to
the
apartment.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
same
evening.
now,
there
were
two
members
of
the
gang
at
large.
we
submit
that
the
officers
did
not
have
to
wait
and
worry
about
these
fellows
committing
other
crimes.
also
the
--
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
petitioner
would
learn
of
the
fact
that
two
of
the
members
of
the
gang
have
been
taken
into
custody
and
would
remove
these
weapons
from
the
apartment.
and
finally,
what
one
could
say
well,
why
they
didn't
go
ahead
and
seized
petitioner,
arrest
him
and
then
the
next
day
go
back
to
the
search
warrant.
well,
we
have
this
fourth
member
of
the
gang
back
out
who
was
still
at
large
and
he
might
be
alerted
by
the
fact
that
these
three
members
were
placed
in
custody
and
might
remove
the
property
before
a
search
warrant
could
be
obtained.
so,
this
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
chimel
criticizes
where
the
officers
routinely
as
a
matter
of
course
dispensed
with
the
requirement
of
a
search
warrant.
chimel
itself
is
replete
with
language
recognizing
that
there
are
situations
where
a
search
without
a
search
warrant
is
justifiable
and
we
would
submit
strongly
that
this
is
one
of
those
situations.
now,
this
is
an
alternate
argument
because
we
urge
very
strongly
that
chimel
is
not
retroactive
but
in
turn
i
feel
that
the
search
passes
master
under
either
chimel
or
pre-chimel
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
officers
were
confronted
with
a
situation
where
time
was
of
the
essence.
this
gang
was
going
around
assaulting
and
robbing
people.
the
evidence
might
be
removed
from
the
apartment
if
the
other
members
of
the
gang
at
large
were
apprised
of
the
fact
that
some
of
their
members
had
been
arrested.
and
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
all
had
access
to
this
apartment
which
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
again,
in
june
--
you
know,
i
read
that
over
last
night
and
i
thought
i've
been
missing
something.
i
come
to
that
record
baum
and
bader
were
only
spoke
--
only
spoke
once
to
the
arresting
officer.
there
was
no
telling
him
and
not
telling
him
again
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
as
this
court
has
found
previously,
they
are
not
infallible
and
i
submit
this
is
a
mistake
on
their
part.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
but
i
--
i
just
last
night
looked
over
this
and
read
the
entire
record
carefully
including
the
state
court
record
and
it's
clear
that
this
officer
spoke
only
once
to
bader
and
baum
and
that
was
the
only
information
he
had
from
them,
that
he
acquired
it
5:30
on
june
the
6th.
and
i
think
these
state
findings
are
entitled
to
great
weight
where
they
are
supported
by
the
evidence
especially
regarding
the
good
faith
of
the
officers
here.
and
i
think
too
the
fact
of
judicial
notice
where
the
court
can
consider
as
evidence
these
facts
of
common
knowledge
that
the
false
identification
is
being
carried
and
that
although
the
man
was
booked
under
this
different
name
that
in
california
you're
booked
under
the
name
you
give.
so
clearly,
the
officers
did
consider
miller
to
be
hill.
now,
i
think
we
get
to
the
heart
of
the
case
here.
we
have
a
valid
arrest
and
we
assume
it's
a
valid
arrest.
now,
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
of
course,
is
permissible.
the
scope
bearing
with
the
time,
we
submit,
that
the
search
occurred,
pre-chimel
and
post-chimel.
now,
the
question
is
what
is
the
effect
of
this
mistake?
first
of
all
we'd
like
to
note
that
it's
highly
unlikely
that
upholding
this
search
would
open
up
a
pandora's
box.
the
party's
diligent
research
does
not
disclose
this
factual
situation
arising
in
any
other
state
or
federal
case.
it's
a
highly
unusual
situation
and
the
fourth
amendment
bars
only
unreasonable
searches.
now,
what
is
their
unreasonable
in
conducting
the
same
type
of
search
which
would
have
been
permissible
had
the
arrestee
in
fact
and
the
petitioner
and
the
officers
not
have
made
this
reasonable
mistake.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
not
clear.
all
that
was
introduced
are
two
pieces
of
paper.
now,
we
don't
know
if
they
were
in
notebook
form
or
what.
they
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
don't
know.
they
did
look
inside
the
book.
we
don't
know
that
there
was
a
book.
it
might
have
been
opened
like
that
if
there
were
book,
since
that
was
the
current
period.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
you
might
just
see
it.
you
might
open
up
a
drawer
and
there
it
is.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
fifth
amendment
point
is
made
somewhat
inappropriately
by
petitioner
in
this
court
because
it
was
not
at
all
raised
in
either
of
the
four
courts
in
the
state
proceedings
and
it
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
in
effect
it's
what
justice
jackson
called
the
irving
case
smuggling
in
an
issue.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
a
sealed
envelope?
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
envelope.maybe
there
would
be
a
knife
between
the
pages
of
the
book.
remember
there
were
two
knives
used.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
that
the
officers
could
look
inside
that
kind
of
envelope.
no,
not
that
it
might
at
the
present
day
law
anyway
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
under
pre-chimel
i
think
that
they
could
really
because
the
scope
was
not
restricted
and
they
can
look
for
evidence,
they
can
look
for
stolen
property
and
they
can
look
for
pretty
much
what
so
legitimate
matter
of
concern
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
basic
limitation
on
that.
i
think
the
mere
evidence
rule
being
rejected
in
warden
v.
hayden
eliminates
this
distinctions
where
we
worry
about
one
piece
of
paper
which
in
one
case
maybe
a
so-called
instrumentality
by
the
court
reaching
a
strained
application
of
that
doctrine,
save
it
from
a
mere
evidence.
i
think
that
you
can
certainly
look
inside
envelopes
under
pre-chimel
law.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
but
again
that's
not
our
situation
here.
the
officers
are
looking
only
in
places
where
a
weapon
could
reasonably
be.
now,
basically
what
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
here
in
his
attempt
to
persuade
us
that
the
search
is
unreasonable
is
an
outmoded
and
totally
inappropriate
concept
of
property
law.
he's
saying,
well
fine
the
arrest
is
alright
and
this
defendant
here,
he
had
the
control
over
the
premises
in
the
sense
of
physical
control,
he
could
go
and
grab
a
weapon.
he
could
go
run
over
to
evidence
but
he
didn't
have
control
in
a
proprietary
sense.
well,
that's
a
totally
inappropriate
standard.
i
think
that
katz
has
effectively
buried
these
distinctions
and
the
--
i
think
what
the
silverman
opinion
says
is
very
appropriate
here.
it
cautions
that
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
be
ascertained
by
resort
of
the
ancient
niceties
of
tort
or
real
property
law.
and
the
jones
case,
the
opinion
by
justice
frankfurter
says
the
same
thing.
now,
i
think
the
principles
involved
in
this
case
are
graphically
illustrated
by
considering
the
following
hypothetical
situation.
let's
assume
that
miller
was
arrested
in
petitioner's
apartment
but
the
petitioner
was
right
there.
and
the
police
wanted
to
arrest
miller
that
they
knew
he
was
visiting
there.
certainly,
even
under
chimel,
the
police
could
search
the
area
within
the
reach
of
the
visitor.
the
officer
need
not
decide,
well
this
is
really
hill's
apartment
here
and
i
have
to
risk
being
shot
by
miller
who
might
grab
a
weapon,
he
has
the
right
to
a
certain
extent
invade
the
privacy
of
the
proprietor
of
these
premises.
now,
question
is
why.
well,
i
think
that
there's
a
certain
assumption
of
risk
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
here,
the
petitioner
talks
about
the
risk
that
the
invasion
of
the
petitioner's
privacy.
well,
one
takes
a
risk
in
inviting
a
visitor
on
the
premises,
just
as
one
may
risk
tort
liability
if
he
falls
over
the
carpet.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
exactly.
i
think
similarly,
if
one
gives
a
key
to
ones
apartment
to
somebody
else
or
leaves
the
door
unlock,
one
assumes
certain
risks.
maybe
a
thief
will
enter.
maybe
a
pursued
felon
will
enter
and
that's
the
situation
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
we
don't
know.
and
he
gave
a
very
strange
explanation.
apparently,
just
didn't
come
right
out
and
say,
“well,
i
got
in
this
way
or
so.”
he
fudged
around
a
bit
and
frazier
versus
cupp,
the
recent
opinion
of
this
court
stated
with
reference
to
the
search
of
a
duffle
bag
there.
well,
so
and
so's
roommate
didn't
have
authority
to
give
consent.
well,
the
court
said
look
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
marshall's
opinion,
“you
left
that
bag
there
in
his
custody
and
you
sort
of
assume
the
risk
that
he'd
say,
well,
look
through
the
bag.”
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
there's
nothing
to
show
that.
but
he
obviously
got
in
somehow
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
i
think
what's
interesting
is
that
absolutely
no
defense
was
offered
at
the
preliminary
hearing
or
at
the
trial.
not
one
word
of
evidence
to
come
forward
and
indicate
that
this
apartment
had
been
locked
or
whatever.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
no
claim
whatsoever.
similarly,
i
think
that
if
miller's
--
miller
had
been
arrested
in
his
own
apartment,
in
miller's
apartment
and
this
had
all
been
a
mistake,
what
would
happen
if
the
officers
found
marijuana
on
miller's
pocket,
let's
say
or
in
the
drawer.
i
think
it
would
be
clearly
admissible
against
miller
despite
the
invasion
of
his
privacy,
if
it
was
a
reasonable
mistake
to
arrest
miller
and
to
search
his
premises.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
much
more
evidence
here.
it
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
mistake
and
that's
always
going
to
be
a
case
by
case
basis.
let's
say
somebody
says
it's
a
six-foot,
200-pound
blonde
who
lives
in
apartment
6
at
1931
so
and
so
drive.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
it
would
be
that
broad.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
when
there
are
exigent
circumstances
that
this
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
necessarily.
i
would
want
to
say
what
it
is
in
the
warden
versus
hayden.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
said
that
is
the
normal
rule
and
not
to
dispense
with
that,
you
would
have
to
have
exceptional
circumstances
and
normally
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
attempted
to
outline
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
there
were
other
robbers
in
this
gang
at
large
and
that
when
they
heard
that
petitioner's
confederates
were
arrested
or
that
petitioner
was
there,
then
they
would
come
and
remove
these
weapons
from
the
premises.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
an
interesting
question.
i'm
fairly
rather
pessimistic
under
california
law.
officers
have
asked
me
that.
i
don't
know
under
california
law
what
would
give
the
right
to
camp
out
in
the
apartment
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
was
no
tearing
down
of
any
door
here.
this
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
search.
they
knocked
and
identified
themselves.
they
followed
all
the
proper
rules.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
he
says,
“i
don't
have
a
loaded
revolver
and
its
right
there.”
that's
quite
a
different
situation.
and
there's
a
lot
of
other
circumstances.
in
other
words
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
could
--
they
could
not.
they
had
to
of
course
look
into
areas
where
a
person
could
be
secreted
but
we're
not
going
to
claim
the
extreme
position
that
they
could
look
inside
the
drawer,
because
obviously
a
person
can't
be
secreted
there.
so
we're
justifying
it
on
this
other
basics.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
certainly.
let's
say
under
a
bed
or
in
the
closet
or
in
another
room.
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
that,
we
would
submit.
i
think
that
if
the
court
would
conclude
otherwise,
you
know
any
felon
could
frustrate
an
arrest
and
search.
all
he'd
have
to
do
is
say,
“i'm
not
the
defendant.
i'm
not
the
man
you're
looking
for”
and
especially
if
he
has
phony
id.
then
what
does
the
officer
have
to
do.
then
he
would
stopped
as
a
matter
of
law
from
continuing,
he
would
have
to
go
away
and
find
some
100%
proof
that
this
in
fact
was
the
criminal
and
then
perhaps
the
evidence
could
be
removed.
this
would
really
give
the
criminal
a
veto
power
over
every
search.
he
just
have
to
claim,
“i'm
not
the
man.”
now,
go
prove
it.
now,
i
won't
discuss
this
purported
issue
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
pointed
to
that
it
was
deliberately
waived,
i
think,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
alright.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
i
--
i
certainly
don't.
i
think
that
gullett
itself.
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
gullett
said,
there
is
no
special
sanctity
and
papers
as
distinguished
from
other
forms
of
property
to
render
them
immune
from
search
and
seizure
if
only
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
principles
of
the
cases
in
which
other
property
may
be
seized.
so
then
we
have
warden
v.
hayden
dispensing
with
this
mere
evidence
rule.
now,
if
we
allow
confessions
from
a
man's
lips.
we
allow
blood
to
be
taken
from
his
veins
without
a
warrant
under
schmerber.
is
paper
more
sacred
than
this?
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
its
testimonial
in
a
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
not
testimonial
in
a
compulsive
sense.
i
think
that's
what
essential.
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
safeguard
against
compulsory
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
i
think
is
equally
testimonial
and
it's
probably
a
lot
more
compulsive.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
as
if
to
the
extent
that
one
would
assume
it
to
be
testimonial,
blood
is
certainly
as
much
though
i
would
think
but
this
court
has
ruled
at
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
can't
see
a
distinction
though
if
we
uphold
that
in
schmerber,
i
think
we
have
to
uphold
it
here
and
i
think
it's
like
a
spy's
paper
where
we
say
spy's
papers
enable,
those
are
instrumentalities
but
the
same
papers
are
mere
evidence
or
political
assassins'
notebooks,
are
those
instrumentalities
or
are
they
mere
evidence.
i
think
we
could
get
into
an
awful
lot
of
problems
in
this
situation.
finally,
i
have
only
about
three
or
four
minutes,
i'd
like
to
note
our
views
on
the
retroactivity
issue.
i
think
it's
significant
--
first
of
all,
under
chimel,
i
try
to
indicate
the
exigent
circumstances
and
then
it
was
after
court
hours
and
the
time
was
of
the
essence
but
we
would
submit
that
chimel
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
and
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
file
a
letter
a
listing
recent
decisions
on
the
question
of
retroactivity
if
i
might
do
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
it's
giving
citations
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
i
did
this
morning.
i've
indicated
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
have
it
from
the
horse's
mouth
that
it's
chimel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
although
there
have
been
five
or
six
variance
of
the
pronunciation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
according
to
mr.
chimel.
yes.
there
are
three
federal
circuits
and
five
states
that
have
held
that
chimel
is
fully
prospective.
it
applies
only
to
searches
conducted
after
the
date
of
that
decision.
in
alaska,
new
mexico
where
the
only
jurisdictions
that
have
decided
to
the
contrary,
we
submit
that
desist
is
the
governable
standard
here.
desist
set
forth
the
function
of
the
three
considerations,
the
purpose
to
be
served,
the
extent
of
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
chimel
stresses
in
footnote
12
that
the
fourth
amendment's
purpose
is
to
prevent
not
simply
to
redress
unlawful
police
action.
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
would
help
deter
illegal
police
conduct
to
punish
in
effect
police
and
prosecutors
who
would
justifiably
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
of
many
years
standing
and
conducted
searches
in
total
compliance
with
those
standards.
we're
not
talking
about
unreliable
or
false
evidence.
it's
only
a
procedural
question
not
affecting
the
issue
the
guilt
or
innocence.
so
in
effect,
and
certainly
the
extent
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
is
clear,
this
court
two
years
before
chimel
and
one
year
after
the
present
search
in
the
cooper
case
quoted
that
statement
in
rabinowitz
that
has
since
been
disapproved
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
within
three
weeks
of
the
decision
in
chimel,
70%
of
the
states
joined
respondents
in
a
petitioning
for
rehearing
and
this
shows
the
impact
of
this
decision
and
it's
been
evident
to
me
in
going
around
explaining
the
police
officers.
they
regard
this
as
a
greater
impact
than
miranda.
they
regard
this
as
a
greatest
impact
on
their
day
to
day
enforcement
techniques
of
any
decision
that
has
come
down
in
the
criminal
field
in
recent
years
and
the
memorandum
which
is
attached
to
this
letter
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
court
shows
how
that
court
has
had
to
completely
revise
its
procedures
and
place
judges
on
call
nights
and
weekends
to
issue
search
warrants
because
of
chimel.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
would
be
an
enormous
impact
on
the
courts
in
requiring
them
to
retry
a
multitude
of
cases
decided
in
reliance
on
chimel
and
if
there
is
any
case
in
which
this
court
still
believes
that
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
should
be
applied
prospectively,
this
is
certainly
the
case
under
the
standards
which
this
court
has
held.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
know.
i
believe
it
was
your
honor
in
that
footnote
12
in
desist
to
note
that
it
can't
be
unreasonable
if
that
was
the
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
we
certainly
concur
with
that.
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
not
in
view
of
the
particular
wording
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
searches
are
to
be
judged
in
light
of
their
reasonableness
and
that
certainly
must
imply
what
the
law
is
at
the
time
the
search
was
conducted.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
that's
all
we
have
unless
there
are
any
questions.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
is
a
re-argument
in
a
direct
appeal
from
a
state
conviction.
the
sole
issues
in
this
case
involve
the
search
and
seizure
which
occurred
in
the
petitioner’s
apartment
in
1966.
and
beside
from
the
issue
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
chimel
decision
there
are
two
or
three
issues
involving
the
legality
of
the
search
under
pre-chimel
law.
before
reaching
these
issues
however
i’d
like
to
quickly
dispose
off
the
new
element
that
petitioner
has
injected
into
the
case,
namely
this
collateral
proceeding
in
the
california
courts
whereby
i
believe
within
a
month
previously,
the
kidnapping
count
was
set
aside
but
that
was
on
a
state
law
ground
and
that
is
not
even
a
final
judgment
that
is
being
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
must
lead
to
this
state,
sometime
within
the
last
month,
i
believe
it
was,
and
that’s
not
even
final
yet
and
frankly
i
don’t
see
any
bearing
on
it.
the
kidnapping
count
is
gone
but
the
robbery
counts
which
carry
a
maximum
of
life
imprisonment
remain.
in
fact,
although
petitioner’s
minimum
is
one
year
since
that
time
not
applicable
to
him,
the
statute
provides
for
a
15
year
minimum
whereas
here,
there
is
a
bodily
injury
to
the
victim.
so
that’s
really
something
collateral.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
so
basically,
getting
to
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
i
would
like
to
again
outline
the
facts,
although
counsel
has
because
they
are
a
bit
confusing
and
i
don’t
think
a
complete
statement
has
been
given.
on
saturday,
june
4th,
1966,
a
robbery
is
committed,
involving
a
brutal
assault
and
unnecessary
assault
by
gang
of
fur
armed
men.
one
of
whom
is
petitioner
and
this
is
part
of
a
series
of
robberies
in
the
san
fernando
valley
area
of
los
angeles.
now,
two
days
later,
the
police
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
and
petitioner
at
page
10
of
his
opening
brief
really
concedes
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
so
there’s
no
need
to
dwell
in
detail
on
that.
what
the
police
do
is
they
proceed
to
petitioner’s
apartment.
they
do
not
have
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant.
they
go
in
order
to
seize
the
weapons
and
the
stolen
property
that’s
involved
with
the
robbery
in
the
present
case.
and
this
is
even
arguably
done
with
the
consent
of
the
one
of
the
other
robbery
gang
members
who
is
in
custody.
but
that
is
not
central
to
the
case.
the
police
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
mr.
bader.
he
is
one
of
the
four
men,
baum
and
bader
were
arrested.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
has
told
them
about
this
and
they
have
independent
information
in
their
files
connecting
petitioner
with
these
two
men
and
with
the
series
of
robberies
in
that
area.
so
the
police
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
roommate,
that’s
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
stated
that
arguably
he
did
because
he
said
“you
can
go
to
the
apartment.”
and
that’s
where
the
loot
is
and
the
weapons
are.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
isn’t.
no,
although
i
noted
briefly
in
our
respondents
brief
that
we
don’t
think
that’s
dispositive,
the
fact
that
that
was
not
a
ground
upheld
by
the
appellate
court.
i
just
injected
that
that
we
seek
to
uphold
the
validity
of
the
search
on
other
grounds.
now,
what
the
police
do
is
they
knocked
and
they
identified
themselves
and
they’re
confronted
by
a
man
who
opens
the
door
and
who
looks
exactly
like
petitioner
hill.
and
they
have
descriptions
of
petitioner
hill
from
the
victims
of
which
there
were
three.
although
not
all
of
them
gave
full
description.
but
they
have
general
descriptions
and
they
have
of
course
a
description
from
petitioner’s
roommate
and
they
have
their
own
information
from
their
files
involving
previous
arrest
of
petitioner.
so
they
go
there
and
there
is
a
man
who
the
record
bader
indicates
is
only
10
lbs
off
in
weight
and
2
inches
in
height.
and
these
are
discrepancies
which
would
not
necessarily
be
apparent
to
the
officers
and
could
be
accounted
for
by
any
--
let’s
say
ambiguity
in
the
victim’s
description.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
so
i
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
affirm
the
validity
of
the
arrest
as
such.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
and
of
the
arrest
as
such,
they
had
a
rather
curious
approach
to
the
legality
of
the
search
which
i’ll
mention
in
passing.
now,
what
happens
is
before
the
officers
even
enter
the
apartment,
they
see
a
gun
with
a
loaded
clip
in
plain
view
from
the
threshold
to
the
apartment
sitting
on
the
coffee
table.
they
asked
this
man,
what
do
you
know
about
guns
being
on
the
premises?
he
says
“i
don’t
know
about
guns
being
on
the
premises.”
well
what
about
this
one?
you
know,
this
already
certainly
alerts
them
as
to
evasive
conduct
by
the
person
they
suspect
being
the
member
of
the
robbery
gang.
so,
he
is
also
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
for
this
presence.
he
is
asked
how
did
he
get
in
here,
“well,
i
don’t
know,
i
just
got
in
here.”
where
is
petitioner
hill?
“oh,
i
don’t
know
where
he
is,
you
know.”
so,
then
he
says
“i’m
miller
and
i’ve
got
identification
to
prove
it.”
but
are
the
officers
supposed
to
believe
that
when
he
tells
them
he
doesn’t
know
anything
without
a
gun
in
plain
sight?
so
they
are
entitled
--
as
justice
black
stated
in
a
previous
argument
today
to
assume
that
the
person
who
opens
the
door
especially
when
he
matches
the
tenant’s
description
is
the
person
in
control.
now,
this
is
where
the
divergence
begins
in
the
treatment
of
the
case
between
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
state
supreme
court.
the
court
of
appeal
adopted
the
approach
suggested
by
petitioner
that
somehow
what
is
important
in
ascertaining
the
legality
of
a
search
is
not
the
dominion
and
control
of
the
person
over
the
premises,
in
a
physical
sense
but
at
somehow
his
proprietary
control
that
matters.
well,
this
is
a
concept
that
i
believe
this
court
has
rejected
time
and
time
again
in
the
jones
case,
silverman
case
and
i
think
finally
buried
in
the
katz
case.
that
the
right
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
whatever
its
scope
does
not
depend
upon
proprietary
matters
but
rather
upon
the
physical
dominion
and
control
because
after
all,
it’s
for
the
officer’s
protection.
and
i
think
that
katz
indicates
that
clearly,
we’re
concerned
with
the
ability
of
the
person
to
grab
a
weapon,
all
of
these
cases
indicate
this
is
the
consideration.
now,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
that
miller
did.
we
have
never
made
that
contention.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that
is
the
case,
not
that
miller,
no.
miller
did
not.
now,
hearing
the
arguments
in
the
white
case
involving
electronic
surveillance
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
katz
decision
has
its
one
of
its
facets
of
the
protection
of
the
right
to
privacy,
a
concern
really
with
assuming
a
risk
of
invasion
of
privacy
and
i
think
that’s
really
the
key
to
this
aspect
of
this
case.
the
risk
that
the
public
will
have
access
to
the
person’s
words
or
his
property.
if
you
leave
that
telephone
booth
door
open,
it’s
a
different
matter.
if
you
leave
your
front
door
open
or
if
you
invite
people
into
your
premises
that’s
a
different
matter
and
that’s
exactly
what
we
think
is
the
case
here.
there
is
a
certain
assumption
of
the
risk
by
having
visitors
in
your
apartment.
if
you
invite
the
visitor
in,
let’s
say
hill
had
been
there
and
they
had
come
to
arrest
miller.
it
was
hill’s
place.
i
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
miller
had
no
proprietary
control
over
the
premises,
it
would
mean
that
the
officers
would
have
to
say
“we’re
not
going
to
search
here
because
we’re
invading
hill’s
privacy.”
i
think
that
miller
could’ve
grabbed
a
weapon
of
a
drawer
next
to
him
even
under
the
chimel
scope
and
injured
the
officer.
so
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i’m
curious
about
it
myself
and
i
have
no
idea
from
the
record
or
from
any
other
source.
all
i
know
is
that
he
was
asked
for
an
explanation.
he
was
unable
to
give
one
apparently.
now,
i
think
that
the
stoner
opinion
itself
recognizes
that
apparent
authority
can
provide
the
basis
for
searching
even
when
there
is
a
mistake.
now,
i
think
what’s
important
here
is
that
if
you
assume
that
hill
was
there,
the
search
that
took
place
was
totally
proper.
it
was
a
type
of
search
that
would
have
been
permissible
under
pre-chimel
law
and
the
fact
that
this
mistake
occurred
in
good
faith
should
make
no
difference
and
the
treatment
of
it.
otherwise,
certainly
any
felon
could
frustrate
any
search
by
claiming
to
be
somebody
other
than
the
petitioner
and
unless
the
officer
had
personally
seen
them,
that
would
just
automatically
preclude
further
search.
and
i
think
that
frazier
versus
cupp
also
speaks
in
terms
of
assumption
of
the
risk
as
far
as
the
scope
of
permissible
search.
now,
one
thing
i
would
like
to
get
in
to,
after
concluding
now
that
the
scope
of
the
search
was
unexceptional.
the
items
being
found
in
the
bedroom
is
this
question
of
the
diary.
i
think,
other
than
that,
there
can’t
be
any
particular
novelty
to
this
case
under
pre-chimel
law.
now,
first
of
all,
we’d
like
to
state
strenuously
that
we
believe
that
issue
is
improperly
raised
before
this
court.
it’s
been
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
not
on
this
ground.
no,
in
fact,
perhaps
the
making
of
an
objection
on
other
grounds
is
affirmatively
indicative
of
the
waiver
of
an
objection
on
this
ground.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
to
all
of
the
evidence
in
general.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
that
language
does
appear.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
of
the
objection.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
don’t
think
that
that
can
really
be
dispositive
of
the
issue
or
even
that
significant.
because
after
all,
if
we
look
at
the
purpose
of
an
objection,
it’s
to
appraise
opposing
counsel
and
the
trial
court
of
the
basis
for
the
objection
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
say
particularly
not
in
view
of
the
novel
nature
of
this
allegation
because
i
know
of
no
cases
under
california
law
or
under
federal
law
applicable
to
the
states
where
it
has
been
held
that
because
this
is
a
document,
that
alone
bars
its
admission
and
evidence.
so
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
objections.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
the
diary
can
be
found
at
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
on
page
41
itself.
it
is
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
concluded
a
damning
account
of
petitioner’s
involvement
really.
it’s
a
rather
unusual
thing,
it
relates
the
fact
of
the
robbery
and
some
of
this
is
in
criminal
jargon
but
in
effect
some
of
the
members
of
the
gang
including
petitioner
went
to
tj,
that’s
tijuana
and
scored
7k’s
which
means
purchasing
seven
kilos
of
marijuana.
and
that
when
they
came
back,
they
went
to
bed
and
then
couple
of
them
went
out
to
get
something
to
eat
and
then
“this
turned
out
to
be
mistake
because
they
got
busted.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that’s
correct.
made
under
absolutely
no
compulsion
whatsoever,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
criminals
do
not
customarily
confess
their
crimes
with
the
introductory
phrase
“dear
diary,
yesterday
i
did
so
and
so.”
this
is
something
that
is
totally
volunteered
and
that
brings
me
really
to
the
merits
of
this
claim
of
a
fifth
amendment
basis,
let
me
just
state
briefly
though
this
was
not
raised
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
not
at
the
trial
court,
not
at
the
court
of
appeal,
not
the
supreme
court
of
california,
not
even
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
so
under
the
cardinal
versus
louisiana
decision
and
this
rule
40
of
this
court’s
rules,
i
think
that
precludes
it
but
on
the
merits,
i
think
that
guled
itself
who’s
mere
evidence
rule
was
at
least
to
a
very
substantial
degree
rejected
in
warden
v.
hayden
precludes
the
claim
made
here.
and
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
a
certain
extent
it
was.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
this
i
think
is
dispositive,
the
following
sentence
if
i
may
note
from
guled
itself.
there
is
no
special
sanctity
in
papers
as
distinguished
forms
of
property
to
render
them
in
unit
from
search
and
seizure
if
only
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
principles
of
the
cases
in
which
other
property
maybe
seized.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
clothing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
that
that
language
in
conjunction
with
whatever
this
court
would
want
to
do
in
the
future
certainly
leaves
the
court
open
to
hold
the
documents
are
in
a
special
class.
my
only
statement
is
that
guled
in
effect
said,
there
is
a
mere
evidence
rule
and
it’s
not
because
of
documents.
documents
and
clothing,
everything
is
the
same
way.
so
once
this
court
in
warden
dealt
narrowly
with
the
issue
before
it,
namely
non
documentary
evidence,
i
think
that
by
the
weight
of
that
language,
despite
the
reservation
of
the
questions--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true
and
if
it
is
testimonial
however,
it
is
not
under
any
compulsion.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
i
hardly
view
that
as
the
test.
i
think
the
test
is
of
course
whether
this
was
given
under
any
compulsion
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
i
don’t
think
that
the
compulsion
goes
to
the
manner
in
which
the
document
was
acquired
by
the
police.
i
think
the
compulsion
goes
to
the
making
of
the
statement
and
of
course
when
the
statement
was
made,
it
bears
all
the
indicia
of
reliability.
here’s
a
man
in
his
own
apartment
writing
down
his
own
thoughts,
events
of
the
day.
so
i
think
that
there’s
no
compulsion
whatsoever.
it’s
not
as
if
the
officer
had
said,
“you’re
under
arrest.
now
write
down
what
you’ve
done
the
last
24
hours.
now,
some
question
was
raised
at
the
previous
argument
about
why
the
officers
looked
to
this
diary.
well,
i
stated
that
hypothetically,
the
police
might
have
been
concerned
with
finding
a
weapon
or
some
contraband
there
and
i
think
that
the
events
of
the
last
day
or
two,
give
some
way
to
my
hypothetical.
it
was
interesting
to
read
in
the
washington
post
yesterday
about
a
man
who
attempted
to
escape
from
death
row
in
chicago,
and
had
in
a
hallowed
out
book
of
the
collected
works
of
edgar
allen
poke
a
pistol.
and
he
succeeded
i
believe
in
wounding
some
of
the
guards
and
there’s
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
to
that
extent
it
would
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
in
all
fairness,
i
must
say
they
did
not
uphold
this
on
the
consent
issue,
they
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
was
a
footnote
in
there
opinion
and
that
can
be
found
in
the
appendix
on
page
76,
footnote
2
that
the
consent
issue
would
not
be
decided
by
that
court
because
the
facts
surrounding
it
whether
it
was
not
a
mere
submission
to
authority,
not
bound
up
with
unlawful
conduct
were
never
developed.
so,
in
other
words,
the
supreme
court
of
california
chose
to
uphold
the
search
on
grounds
other
than
consent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
chimel.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
that
is
it
and
this
issue
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
on
the
diary,
i
would
like
to
add
a
couple
more
comments.
first
of
all,
schmerber
itself
notes
the
shift
in
the
fourth
amendment
view
from
property
to
persons
and
their
right
of
privacy.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
not
anywhere,
not
anywhere
from
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
none
whatsoever.
not
even
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
for
the
very
first
time
of
the
opening
brief,
i
would
like
to
note
one
thing
perhaps
a
little
bit
collaterally
but
the
enormous
effect
of
any
ruling
by
this
court
holding
that
papers
are
somehow
sacrosanct
was
brought
home
to
me
recently
working
on
the
preparation
of
this
sirhan
sirhan
case
involving
the
diary
of
a
political
assassin.
i
think
that
if
there
somehow
is
going
to
be
a
special
rule
for
papers
that
the
court
has
to
be
fully
aware
of
the
ramifications
of
this
giving
special
treatment
to
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
cover
one
aspect
of
the
search
before
getting
to
the
retroactivity
question.
namely
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
under
chimel
because
we
do
not
in
any
way
feel
that
the
retroactivity
issue
is
dispositive
of
this
case
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
chimel
and
the
cases
upon
which
it
relies
have
held
that
the
requirement
for
the
search
warrant
should
not
routinely
be
dispensed
with.
but
that
word
is
impracticable
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
that
one
need
not
to
be
obtained
and
this
is
precisely
a
case
that
comes
within
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
chimel.
in
chimel
of
course,
the
officers
had
weeks
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
here,
let’s
look
at
the
chronology
leading
up
to
the
search.
the
offense
was
committed
late
on
a
saturday
night
only
after
5:30
pm
on
the
following
monday,
two
days
later
that
the
officers
require
their
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner.
this
was
after
court
hours.
they
would
have
had
to
wait
well
over
12
hours
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
perhaps
more.
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
first
tuesday
in
california
at
least
is
a
court
holiday
in
the
month
of
june
in
election
year.
so,
this
really
might
be
a
36
hour
wait,
instead
of
a
12
hour
wait.
now,
was
there
any
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
wait
this
day
or
two?
well,
the
officers
knew
that
there
was
a
fourth
member
of
the
robbery
gang
at
large.
this
gang
was
armed
and
dangerous.
they
had
committed
several
other
robberies
in
the
area.
the
officers
knew
that
the
weapons
and
the
stolen
property
were
at
petitioner’s
apartment.
thus
time
was
of
the
essence.
the
officers
were
confronted
with
what
was
very
close
to
a
hot
pursuit
situation.
and
there
were
these
reasons
for
not
delaying
the
search
until
the
search
warrant
could
be
obtained.
petitioner
and
the
fourth
member
of
the
gang,
(inaudible)
were
at
large
and
they
could
still
be
committing
other
assaults
and
robberies.
secondly,
the
arrest
of
two
members
of
the
gang,
just
two-and-a-half
hours
before
the
search
here,
might
alert
petitioner
to
flee
from
his
apartment
and
perhaps
from
the
jurisdiction.
and
thirdly,
if
petitioner
were
arrested
that
evening
and
then
search
of
the
apartment
delayed
another
day
or
two,
that
fourth
man
back
--
might
have
come
back
being
alerted
by
petitioner’s
arrest
or
the
arrest
of
the
two
other
man
bader
and
baum
and
realized
that
the
officers
would
have
seen
incriminating
evidence
when
they
arrested
petitioner
and
then
might
have
removed.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
petitioner?
he
was
arrested
about
thursday
or
friday
of
that
week
but
that
is
not
on
the
record.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
but
they
didn’t
know
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
there
was
--
i
don’t
know
if
there
was
a
warrant
or
not.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it’s
a
great
interest
to
me
to
but
it’s
no
where
in
the
record,
not
even
in
the
local
courts
record.
now,
i
think
any
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
it’s
significant
that
the
officers
knew
that
both
guns
in
the
robbery
and
all
of
the
remaining
stolen
property
were
on
these
premises
and
that
these
were
armed
and
dangerous
men
and
they
had
to
act
quickly.
now,
i
won’t
go
into
it
in
detail
but
the
problem
of
exigent
circumstances
is
graphically
demonstrated
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
the
americans
for
effective
law
enforcement.
they
demonstrate
the
practical
necessities
for
having
a
meaningful
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
the
chimel
rule.
the
brief
that
that
organization
has
filed,
details
a
couple
of
presently
pending
cases
where
the
murder
weapon
itself
was
disposed
off,
during
the
time
that
the
officers
sought
to
comply
with
chimel
and
went
out
to
try
and
get
the
search
warrant.
now,
one
related
problem
of
course
is
what
can
be
done
to
secure
the
premises
and
that’s
one
of
the
most
serious
problems
and
in
california,
our
view
is
that
the
premises
cannot
be
secured
to
the
extent
that
people
who
are
not
involved
in
criminal
conduct
are
restrained,
their
movements
are
followed
around
the
house.
perhaps
a
matron
has
to
come
because
the
wife
of
the
petitioner
is
there,
she
wants
to
use
the
facilities.
she
could
dispose
off
evidence,
you
have
to
have
an
armada
men
and
equipment
there
to
follow
everybody
around
the
house.
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
about
that.
and
that
is
what
has
been
most
difficult
to
leave
with,
under
the
chimel
decision.
now
as
far
as
retroactivity
is
concerned,
we
detailed
our
views
in
the
brief
and
i
think
it’s
important
of
course
to
apply
a
fully
prospective
test
to
the
chimel
decision.
the
purpose
of
the
decision
of
course
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
that’s
not
going
to
be
deterred
by
punishing
police
officers
for
what
they
did
relying
on
the
existing
law
as
decided
by
this
court
several
years
ago.
and
up
to
two
or
three
years
ago,
specifically
at
the
time
this
search
was
conducted.
there
certainly
has
been
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
of
a
retroactive
application
of
this
chimel
decision
would
be
i
submit
greater
than
the
effect
of
any
decision
of
this
court
on
the
administration
of
justice.
just
thousands
of
prisoners
would
be
sent
back
for
new
trials
and
only
questionably
could
be
retried.
and
i’d
like
to
launch
with
the
court
an
original
and
ten
copies
of
a
memorandum
which
i
have
provided
petitioner
here,
a
manhour
cost
study
regarding
the
chimel
decision.
and
that
report
is
very
significant
in
indicating
that
annually,
the
chimel
decision
will
cost
the
los
angeles
police
department
alone
an
additional
86,000
manhours.
and
the
monetary
cost
is
close
to
half-a-million
dollars.
and
that
is
just
for
police
officers,
not
the
clerical
help
and
the
equipment
that
this
is
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
is
what
i’m
referring
to,
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
get
search
warrants.
it’s
a
very
involved
process.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
to
obtain
search
warrants,
that’s
all
that
i’m
talking
about
here
to
draw
of
affidavits.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
could
i
prevail
upon
the
court
for
an
additional
minute?
and
this
is
just
the
cost
to
police
officers.
not
clerical,
personnel.
now,
this
i
believe
averages
out
to
about
30
extra
police
officers
for
the
city
of
los
angeles
a
year
because
of
this.
and
consequently,
one
can
imagine
the
retroactive
application
of
this.
and
what
i
would
like
to
note
in
conclusion
as
far
as
the
impact
of
this
decision
is
that,
this
strikes
at
the
most
sensitive
nature
of
police
work.
the
type
of
property
crime,
burglaries
particularly
where
the
rate
of
recovery
is
lowest
it
might
be
of
interest
to
your
honors
to
note
that
less
than
10%
of
stolen
property
is
recovered.
now,
when
the
time
that
takes
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
each
case
which
is
several
hours
is
multiplied
by
the
hundreds
of
situations,
every
day
that
occurred
necessitating
one
under
the
chimel
decision,
one
can
see
the
impact
of
this
decision.
one
can
easily
point
to
one
case
or
at
the
other
case
and
say
a
warrant
could
have
been
obtained
here.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
overall
impact,
it’s
quite
apparent
with
two
million
burglaries
being
committed
annually
in
this
country,
265,000
of
them
in
california.
that
there
is
indeed
a
real
problem
of
just
not
getting
slowed
under
by
police
work.
so
for
these
reasons,
we
would
submit
very
strongly
that
the
date
of
prospectivity
should
be
adopted
that
all
searches
conducted
previous
to
the
date
of
chimel,
not
be
governed
by
the
rule
of
that
decision
and
we
urge
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
is
lawful
in
all
respects.
