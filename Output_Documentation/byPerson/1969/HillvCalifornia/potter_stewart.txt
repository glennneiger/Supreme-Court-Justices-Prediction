stewart
you
mean
it's
invalid
under
chimel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
proceeding
on
the
premise
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
of
hill?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
--
how
big
was
this
apartment?
justice
potter
stewart
four-room
apartment
including
the
kitchen.
and
miller
was
in
the
living
room,
was
he,
when
the
police
came
in?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
diary
was
found
in
the
drawer
of
the
desk
or
closet
or
be
over
something
in
what
room?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
bedroom.
justice
potter
stewart
by
good
faith
in
this
context,
do
you
mean
that
the
--
you
submit
that
there
was
a
finding
by
both
of
the
courts
state
or
all
three
of
the
courts
of
the
state
that
the
officers
genuinely
believe
that
miller
was
hill.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
this
risk
being
that
your
visitor,
your
social
guest
may
be
somebody
whom
the
police
are
pursuing
or
want
to
arrest
for
some
reason
and
therefore
going
to
enter
your
house
and
in
the
restriction
search
of
your
guest,
they're
going
to
an
extent
invade
the
privacy
of
your
house,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
miller
get
into
this
house?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
argument
can
be
made.
it's
a
bit
circular
and
i'd
say
was
suggested,
as
i
remembered
in
desist
that
the
time
this
happened,
this
was
not
any
sort
of
a
violation
of
the
constitution
even
in
the
retrospective
wisdom
of
chimel
because
the
constitution
itself
prohibits
only
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
justice
potter
stewart
and
(voice
overlap)
agents
who
rely
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
decisions
of
the
courts
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
acting
unreasonably.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
say
that's
kind
of
a
circular
in
argument.
but
it's
not
lacking
in
realism,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
didn’t
also
the
search
take
placed
before
archie
hill
was
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
after
mr.
miller
was
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
before
mr.
hill
was
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
they
never
got
to
--
the
point
of
getting
arrested?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
that
diary
found?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
the
entire
diary
or
just
a
couple
of
pages?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
the
officers
take
the
couple
of
pages
from
--
a
diary
or
just
a
couple
of
pages
in
the
drawer?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
i
gather
you
could
object
on
fifth
amendment
grounds,
could
you?
justice
potter
stewart
why
couldn’t
they
get
the
diary
into
a
search
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
gather
that
--
i
mean
is
there
anything
apart
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
about
warden
and
hayden?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
question
was
reserved
in
warden
and
hayden.
justice
potter
stewart
this
question
was
reserved,
wasn’t
it,
warden
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
conviction
has
been
set
aside
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
habeas
--
justice
potter
stewart
bader
was
the
petitioner’s
roommate,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
--
it’s
not
your
submission,
is
it
or
is
it
that
bader
gave
consent
to
this
search?
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn’t
the
basis
on
which
this
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
attorney,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
and
then
it
was
state
took
it
to
the
supreme
court
where
it
was
affirmed.
justice
potter
stewart
in
good
faith,
yes,
good
faith,
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
theory,
do
you
submit
at
all
that
it
was
--
you
suggest
igave
mean
that
miller
gave
consent
to
this
search?
justice
potter
stewart
you
suggested
that
bader
might
have?
justice
potter
stewart
the
supreme
court
has
no
objection.
justice
potter
stewart
the
objection
i
think
was
made
was
on
fourth
amendment
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
you
do
with
that
statement
in
void,
the
way
you’re
dealing
with
something
like
diary
and
the
--
incriminated
statement,
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
is
almost
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
for
the
purposes
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
objection
--
justice
potter
stewart
fifth
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment
context.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
doesn’t
the
objection
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
as
to
the
diary,
necessarily
implicate
the
fifth
amendment
consideration
on
the
issue
of
reasonableness?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally
are
those
pages
anywhere
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
diary
pages?
justice
potter
stewart
the
diary
said,
is
on
page
77
of
the
appendix
of
the
footnote
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
by
dispute.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
just
about
the
detailed
confession
for
the
commission
of
the
crime,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know
but
wasn’t
this
--
this
very
question
was
reserved
in
warden
and
hayden?
justice
potter
stewart
to
a
certain
extent
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
upheld
it
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
all
be
it
a
mistaken
identity.
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
decided
the
case
before
this
court’s
decision
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
chimel,
however
it’s
pronounced.
and
the
question
is
whether
this
search
was
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
as
construed
in
the
chimel
and
if
not,
whether
or
not
chimel
should
be
given
retroactivity,
retroactive
application.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
are
other
complications
in
this
case
stemming
from
the
mistaken
identity
and
from
the
fact
that
a
diary
was
among
--
that
they
were
to
recall
and
is
used
against
the
person
and
perhaps
and
the
possibility
of
bader’s
consent.
justice
potter
stewart
i’d
understood
him
to
say
that
30
officers,
additional
officers
in
los
angeles
will
be
required
just
to
carry
out
the
chimel
decision,
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
retroactivity
wouldn’t
require
any
officers
now.
you
can’t
un-ring
a
bell,
you
can’t
--
if
this
was
an
unconstitutional
search,
there’s
no
way
to
constitutionalize
it
now.
you
can’t
go
back
and
get
a
search
warrant
and
go
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it's
invalid
under
chimel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
proceeding
on
the

there
was
