what
did
you
expect
to
find
with
the
diary,
a
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
expect
to
find
in
a
book?
you're
searching
for
weapons
or
disguises.
do
you
expect
to
find
something
in
a
--
the
book
may
have
been
in
plain
sight
in
those
places
where
you
were
entitled
if
you
were
to
look
for
some
other
things
but
all
you
can
see
was
the
book.
what
makes
--
what
entitles
you
to
look
inside
a
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
read
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see
some
pages
but
you
just
don't
automatically
know
what
those
words
say
unless
you
take
the
trouble
to
read
it.
what
right
did
you
have
to
read
those
materials
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
a
fourth
amendment
argument,
is
the
fifth
amendment
argument
here
or
was
that
raised
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it's
just
a
fourth
amendment
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
you
could
have
looked
assuming
the
search
you
were
making
was
valid,
could
you
look
in
a
sealed
envelope?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
been
little
narrow
--
little
narrow
sealed
envelope?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
pre-chimel
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
assume
for
the
moment
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
waived.
do
you
think
he's
got
a
good
fifth
amendment
claim
in
the
introduction
of
the
diary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
302
and
303
of
warden
and
hayden,
we
were
dealing
there
with
clothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
sent
the
the
items
of
clothing
involved
in
this
case
and
that
testimonial
are
communicative
in
nature
and
their
introduction
therefore
did
not
compel
the
respondent,become
a
witness
against
themselves
and
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
case
thus
does
not
require
that
we
consider
whether
there
are
items
of
evidential
value
whose
very
nature
precludes
them
from
being
the
object
to
release
in
search
and
seizure.
and
that
reserve
this
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
suppose
documents
and
documents
but
what
we
have
here
really
is
as
you
can
see,
the
detailed
confession
of
this
very
crime.
that’s
what
he
wrote
down
on
his
diary,
a
very
peculiar
thing
but
that’s
what
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
can
imagine
a
jury
wouldn’t
have
filed
that
very
effective
evidence
upon
which
to
convict
with,
that
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
extent
you
claim
this
search
was
valid
based
on
consent
of
the
absent
owner
co-tenant
really
doesn’t
make
much
difference
where
they
were
looking,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
california
supreme
court
referred
to
the
consent
issue
and
relied
on
itself,
didn’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
fifth
amendment
issue
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
have
any
state
decision
on
this
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
it
have
been
raised?
is
there
rule
in
california
that
says
you
may
not
bring
before
the
court,
something
that
wasn’t
raised
in
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
brief
it,
even
to
the
extent
you
did
here
in
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
brief
it?
your
brief
buoy
here.
justice
byron

you

justice
byron

what
did
you

a

justice

why

you
