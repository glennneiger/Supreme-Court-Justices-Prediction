mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
i'll
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
for
the
respondents
can
be
stated
very
simply
i
believe.
senator
bacon
devised
his
property
in
trust
with
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
white
women
and
children
of
the
city
of
macon.
this
court
decided
in
evans
versus
newton
that
baconsfield
cannot
be
operated
in
accordance
with
that
racial
restriction,
either
by
the
city
of
macon
is
trustee
or
by
private
trustees,
excepting
and
acting
in
accordance
with
that
decision.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
then
held
that
under
state
law,
the
sole
purpose
for
which
this
trust
was
created
applying
several
rules
of
construction
under
state
law
had
failed
that
the
trust
terminated
for
that
reason
without
regard
to
the
racial
limitation
in
the
slightest.
and
because
of
a
state
statute
providing
that
whenever
a
trust
failed
for
any
reason,
a
resulting
lack
of
trust
is
implied
for
the
benefit
of
the
donor
or
testator
or
his
heirs
because
of
that
statute
again
having
nothing
to
do
with
race
or
discrimination
in
any
respect,
this
property
reverts
under
state
law
back
to
the
heirs.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
it
is
a
statute
of
long
vintage.
it's
certainly
predated
1911
when
this
will
was
made.
so
far
as
i
know
its
been
in
the
georgia
law
for
a
hundred
years
or
more.
i
could
get
the
exact
date
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
it.
it's
a
statute
of
long-standing.
so
our
position
may
it
please
the
court,
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
involved
nothing
more
than
the
application
of
state
law
to
a
state
will
and
is
completely
consistent
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
evans
versus
newton.
we
say
that
no
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
been
denied
and
respectfully
urge
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
decision
should
be
availed.
i'll
complete
my
argument
tomorrow
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
attempting
to
reply
in
detail
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
the
assistance
list
to
general.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
record,
particularly,
because
when
this
case
was
here
before
there
was
no
factual
record
before
the
court.
it
seems
to
us,
first
of
all,
that
the
exact
language
of
either
man
of
senator
bacon's
will
is
of
great
importance
to
every
question
which
is
presented
in
this
litigation.
after
first
directing
that
this
property
something
over
a
hundred
acres
originally,
beheld
entrust
for
the
benefit
of
his
wife
and
two
daughters
during
their
lifetimes.
senator
bacon
then
provided
following
the
death
of
the
last
of
them
for
the
creation
of
this
charitable
trust.
using
the
following
language
and
with
the
indulgence
i
quote
“entrust
for
the
sole,
perpetual
and
on
and
then
use
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
the
white
women,
white
girls,
white
boys,
and
white
children
of
the
city
of
macon
to
be
by
them
forever
use
then
enjoyed
us
a
park
and
pleasure
ground
subject
to
the
restrictions
government,
management
rules
and
control
of
the
board
of
managers
is
here
enough
to
provide
it
for.”
the
said
property
onto
no
circumstances
or
at
any
time
for
any
reason
devoted
to
any
other
purpose
or
use
except
in
so
far
as
here
ends
specifically
authorized.
he
further
stated
and
i
quote,
“i
thank
occasion
to
say
that
i'm
limiting
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
this
property
perpetually
to
white
people.
i
am
not
influenced
by
any
on
kindness
or
feeling
or
one
of
consideration
for
the
negroes.
i
am
however
without
hesitation
and
the
opinion
that
are
in
the
social
relations
for
two
races
white
and
negro
should
be
forever
suffered
and
that
they
should
not
have
pleasure
or
recreation
grounds
to
be
use
or
enjoyed
together
and
in
common.”
in
family,
in
explaining
the
motivation
for
this
request
senator
bacon
stated
first
of
all
that
it
was
in
appreciation
to
the
citizens
of
macon
a
propaganda
that
had
been
bestowed
upon
him.
but
especially,
it
was
a
memorial
to
his
two
decease
sons.
using
the
language,
i
should
at
the
same
time
link
their
memories
with
the
pleasures
and
enjoyments
of
the
women
and
children
and
girls
and
boys
of
there
own
race
in
the
community
of
which
they
once
belong
to
happy
the
part.
now,
we
submit
that
senator
bacons
purpose
and
intent
was
stated
as
clearly
as
is
possible
in
the
english
language.
there
are
no
conflicts
or
inconsistencies
in
this
language.
he
spelled
out
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only
and
that
was
the
operation
of
a
park
on
a
racially
restricted
basis
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
white
citizens
or
segment
of
them
of
the
city
of
macon.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
it
was
provided,
your
honor,
that
with
the
permission
on
of
the
board
of
managers
which
how
speak
about
in
just
a
moment
that
white
men
and
the
community
would
be
permitted
to
use
authority.
that
was
a
discretionary
use
so
in
the
discretion
of
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir,
i
think
of
fast
statement
is
that
the
record
indicates
that
white
men
were
permitted
over
the
years
to
use
authority
freely
without
restriction.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
argument
that
there
with
two
purposes.
a
preeminent
park
on
the
one
hand
and
a
park
only
for
white
persons
on
the
other
simply
cannot
be
supported
by
any
fair
reading
of
the
language
of
the
will
itself.
next,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
briefly
to
the
matter
of
city
control
of
the
park.
it
seems
to
us
that
opposing
counsel
have
attempted
to
create
the
impression
that
the
city
of
macon
somehow
round
up
with
a
matter
to
this
simple
ownership
of
this
property.
we
say
the
record
not
only
fails
to
support
this
conclusion
but
clearly
shows
a
contrary
was
true.
to
begin
with,
all
though
senator
bacon
and
the
will
named
the
city
of
macon
as
the
trustee
and
authorized
it
to
appoint
the
first
board
of
managers.
he
gave
the
city
no
power
or
whatever
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
park.
instead,
he
provided
that
the
seven
member
board
of
managers
which
would
be
a
self
perpetuating
body
accepted
only
to
the
right
of
the
city
to
confirm
any
successor
appointment
to
that
board,
“shall
at
all
times
they
have
complete
an
unrestricted
control
and
management
of
the
said
property
with
power
to
make
all
need
for
regulations
for
the
preservation
and
improvement
of
the
same
and
rules
for
the
use
and
enjoyment
there
on.
with
power
to
exclude
it
anytime,
any
place
on
all
person
of
either
sex
and
maybe
deemed
objectionable
on
whose
conduct
or
character
made
by
said
board
be
a
judge
or
considered
objectionable
or
such
as
to
render
for
any
reason
and
the
judgment
of
said
board.
their
presence
and
said
grounds
inconsistent
with
on
prejudicial
that
a
proper
and
law
successful
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
same
for
the
purposes
here
in
contemplated.”
again,
it
seems
to
us
that
by
the
clearest
possible
language
senator
bacon
best
total
control
of
the
operation
of
the
park
not
in
the
city
of
macon
but
in
this
independent
group
of
private
citizens.
he
authorized
the
board,
furthermore,
to
use
a
portion
of
the
property
lying
to
the
east
of
a
street
man
owners
north
avenue
“in
any
amount
of
they
may
deem
best”
for
producing
income
to
defray
expenses
connected
with
the
operation
management
and
preservation
of
the
property
and
in
various
other
way
is
given
total
and
absolute
control.
the
board
of
managers
was
not
made
answerable
at
any
way
of
a
city
and
the
city
had
no
authority
to
remove
any
member
of
the
board
or
otherwise
to
exercise
supervision
over
at
in
any
way.
the
record
further
shows
that
the
board
of
managers
did
in
fact
exercise
complete
management
that
control
exactly
as
contemplated
by
senator
bacon.
the
record
include
detailed
the
minutes
of
many
leadings
of
the
board
over
a
period
of
30
years
in
which
the
most
minute
matters
were
carefully
considered
and
decided.
the
record
shows
a
city
that
did
nothing
without
the
authorization
and
approval
of
the
board.
the
serious
conduct
in
interest
in
baconsfield
were
at
all
times
completely
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
holder
of
the
naked
legal
title.
in
no
time
that
the
city
treat
the
property
as
being
“public
property”
as
it
has
been
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
opposing
counsel.
the
city
did
not
treat
this
property
in
the
same
way
at
all
that
the
city
treated
the
40
or
50
other
city
parks
which
won
in
free
sample
by
city.
i
think
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
swimming
pool
has
been
referred
to
in
this
case
before
it
was
handled.
the
land
on
which
this
pool
was
constructed
was
not
in
the
park
proper
but
in
the
income
producing
area
lying
to
the
east
of
what
is
now
known
as
north
avenue.
the
pool
was
constructed
in
1948.
it
was
constructed
on
a
property
that
was
leased
by
the
board
of
managers
to
the
city
of
macon.
copy
of
the
lease
is
in
the
record.
i
think
of
reference
to
it
clearly
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
standard
lease
similar
to
the
other
types
of
leases
of
property
and
income
producing
area.
the
lease
capital
resides
that
the
premises
and
the
pool
to
be
constructed
by
the
city
shall
be
use
and
operated
in
accordance
with
item
9
of
senator
bacons
will.
and
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
of
managers
and
it
was
provided
that
the
board
contaminate
the
agreement
in
the
event
of
a
breach
not
corrected
within
five
days
after
written
notice.
i'll
take
it
a
self
evident
that
if
the
city
of
macon
at
ever
--at
any
time
regarded
this
as
being
public
property
in
the
sense
in
which
that
expression
has
been
use
in
the
brief
of
opposing
counsel.
there
would
never
had
been
in
any
such
a
lease
arrangement
is
that
why
that
with
respect
to
the
swimming
pool.
counsel
has
suggested
in
this
case
that
there
is
some
significance
of
a
special
nature
to
the
1920
deed
that's
been
referred
to.
i
think
as
we've
pointed
out
completely
in
our
brief
that
that
had
absolutely
no
effect
upon
the
nature
of
the
interest
of
a
city.
it
was
provided
as
i
pointed
out
that
the
charitable
trust
would
not
come
into
being
until
after
the
death
of
the
survivor
of
senator
bacon's
widow
and
two
children.
and
the
sold
papers
as
the
record
clearly
shows
of
a
1920
deed
was
to
make
it
possible
for
the
vesting
of
possession
in
the
city
as
trustee
to
commence
in
1920
rather
than
being
postponed
until
the
death
of
the
survivor
of
those
three
members
of
senator
bacon's
family.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
here
before
there
was
no
factual
record
of
any
kind
before
the
court.
there
was
nothing
specifically
to
show
the
extend
of
the
city
involvement
at
that
time.
in
consequently
the
assumption
is
recorded
in
the
majority
opinion
that
it
was
assumed
that
there
was
a
continuation
of
city
involvement
in
the
operation
of
the
park.
the
record
mail
before
the
court
is
a
fully
developed
record.
it
shows
clearly
and
without
contradiction
that
since
1964
when
the
city
of
macon
resigned
its
trustee
and
its
resignation
was
accepted
by
the
trial
court.
the
city
has
had
no
involvement
of
any
kind
or
character
with
baconsfield
park.
no
funds
had
been
provided.
no
city
employees
have
assisted
in
maintenance
or
preservation
has
been
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
of
involvement
or
a
connection
by
the
city
of
macon
with
the
operation
or
maintenance
of
this
park.
the
board
of
managers
since
1964
has
provided
all
of
the
funds
for
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
park
using
the
income
produced
from
the
leases
of
property
and
the
income
producing
area
for
that
purpose.
in
1968
to
complete
the
record
on
that
park,
receivers
were
appointed
by
the
trial
court
and
a
continuing
to
operate
the
park
gestures
of
the
board
of
managers
had
done
part
of
that
time
pending
the
final
outcome
of
this
litigation.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honors
as
we
now
estimated
that's
about
50
to
60
acres
of
substantial
portion
of
the
acre.
it
was
taken
by
a
condemnation
for
an
understate
highway.
that
50
to
60
acres,
we
believe
includes
not
only
the
park
property
proper
but
also
the
income
producing
area
of
some
5
to
10
acres
lying
to
the
east
of
north
avenue.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
that
money
was
received
by
the
board
of
managers
and
expressed
with
being
held
by
the
receivers
appointed
by
the
trial
court
pending
the
final
disposition
of
this
litigation.
now
with
respect
to
the
city
and
the
park
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
that
is
perhaps
the
sole
exception
to
the
statement
that
i
made.
it
is
correct
that
mr.
nabrit
and
mr.
claiborne
had
pointed
out.
that
certain
representations
were
made
in
documents
furnished
by
the
city
of
macon
in
connection
with
the
wpa
financing.
as
to
why
that
happened
or
the
circumstances
that
surrounding
it,
the
record
itself.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
board
of
managers
in
any
way
authorized
or
consented
to
those
representations
by
the
city
and
save
and
accept
that
sole
dealing
with
the
federal
government.
i
know
of
no
enters
in
this
record
in
which
the
city
has
treated
this
as
public
property.
certainly
as
far
as
in
relations
between
the
city
and
the
board
of
managers
are
concerned,
every
action
of
the
city
has
been
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
trustee
and
with
the
recognition
of
complete
control
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
the
board
of
managers
has
been
in
charged
of
the
improvements.
it
is
correct
as
the
record
shows
that
city
employees
have
assisted
in
the
operation
and
preservation
of
the
park
and
city
farms
of
obviously
to
that
extent
were
involve.
at
the
same
time,
the
board
of
managers
as
i
was
about
to
point
out
in
connection
with
pre
1964
involvement
have
utilized
perhaps
$100,000.00
or
i
think
you're
right
in
that
neighborhood
of
money
made
available
from
the
income
producing
property
also
for
the
preservation
and
maintenance
of
the
park.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
very
difficult
to
the
term
when
precisely
from
the
record
but
i
was
about
to
make
a
statement
that
it
appears
that
at
least
50%
of
the
total
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
found
its
source
and
the
income
produce
from
the
income
producing
property
left
by
senator
bacon.
and
the
perhaps
50%
or
less
of
the
total
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
is
attributable
to
city
funds
directly
or
indirectly.
the
record
as
completed
this
as
is
simply
impossible
mathematically
to
determine
the
exact
percentage
of
support
from
the
city
and
from
the
board
of
managers.
in
our
view
of
the
evidences
as
to
pre
1964
involvement
by
the
city
is
largely
immaterial
to
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case.
and
i
mention
these
facts
solely
because
in
our
judgment
with
due
respect
opposing
counsel
if
greatly
over
emphasized
the
extent
in
nature
of
that
involvement.
it
is
true
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
wpa
funds
were
made
available
in
1935
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
park
and
cities
labor
was
made
available
thereafter
for
a
period
of
perhaps
30
years
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
park.
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
as
the
record
shows
that
this
property
consists
largely
of
grass
and
strawberry
and
trees.
well
over
50%
out
of
it
or
at
least
50%
is
in
trees.
the
only
structure
of
any
kind
on
the
property
other
than
in
the
income
producing
area
to
the
east
of
north
avenue
is
the
club
house
that
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel
in
the
argument
yesterday.
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
during
the
same
period
perhaps
a
$100,000.00
of
income
attributable
to
senator
bacons
own
the
quest
has
also
been
use
in
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
park.
we
would
also
direct
the
courts
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
in
1920
when
the
early
vesting
of
possession
in
the
city
was
agreed
upon
at
that
same
time
$13,000.00
in
bonds
and
interest
that
had
been
left
by
senator
bacon
for
this
purpose
were
turned
over
to
the
city.
and
the
city
agreed
to
make
a
5%
annual
payment
on
the
$13,000.00
or
$650.00.
i
think
this
is
of
significance
in
the
total
picture
i
would
calculate
that
the
amount
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
bonds
that
were
turned
over
to
the
city
in
1920,
plus
the
5%
payments
that
it
was
obligated
to
make
went
over
the
year
have
amounted
to
about
$43,000.00.
so
that
to
that
extent
that
part
of
the
city
involvement
is
attributable
directly
to
funds
left
by
senator
bacon
himself
four
years
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
property.
that
in
addition
to
the
about
$100,000.00
it
came
from
the
income
on
the
income
producing
property
to
the
east.
finally
with
respect
to
that
evidence,
again
i'll
make
the
statement
that
the
record
never
shows
in
anyway
that
the
city
is
sole
to
exercise
control
in
its
dealings
with
the
board
of
managers.
but
instead
everything
that
it
did
in
those
dealings
was
entirely
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
hold
her
own
leave
the
naked
legal
title
recognizing
complete
control
on
the
board
of
managers.
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
three
occasions.
twice
seems
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
shortly
after
evans
versus
newton
was
handed
down
in
march
of
1966,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
at
the
sole
purpose
for
which
the
trust
was
created
has
become
impossible
of
accomplishment
and
has
been
terminated.
this
being
based
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton
that
it
was
impossible
for
senator
bacons
trust
to
be
carried
out
on
the
court
with
a
racial
restriction.
to
respond
that
held
by
the
supreme
court
that
a
resulting
trust
under
a
georgia
statute
was
implied
for
the
benefit
of
the
heirs
of
the
testator.
incidentally,
i
checked
on
that
statute
suggest
today
and
i
find
that
it's
been
in
the
georgia
law
at
least
since
the
code
of
1863
which
was
the
earliest
available
code
from
my
inspection.
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
purely
declaratory
of
the
common
law
and
has
been
in
the
georgia
code
since
the
first
code
was
prepared.
the
case
was
remanded
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
the
trial
court
for
determination
and
ask
to
who
were
the
heirs
of
senator
bacon.
in
the
third
and
final
appearance
of
this
case
before
the
state
supreme
court
in
december
1968,
the
decision
with
respect
towards
the
writ
was
granted.
the
supreme
court
reiterated
its
holding
that
the
trust
terminated
under
state
law.
noting
that
petitioners
had
sought
no
review
of
that
ruling
by
this
court.
he
held
further
that
the
cy
pres
doctrine
could
not
be
applied
on
the
georgia
law
and
rejected
various
other
contentions
of
petitioners
including
all
of
those
urge
before
the
court
yesterday
and
today.
it
held
that
in
short
applying
state
law
or
trust
created
under
a
georgia
will
and
relating
to
georgia
property
had
failed.
and
again
on
the
state
law,
the
property
had
reverted
to
the
heirs
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
perhaps
the
petition
also
answered.
is
there
any
contention
in
this
case
that
in
dealing
with
desired
first
statute
your
decide
first
statute
of
the
georgia
court
and
parted
when
the
courts
decision
as
doctrine
involved
when
the
general
under
georgia
law.
in
other
words,
is
there
any
contention
with
this
case
that
is
been
discriminatory
applications
aside
for
the
statute
of
the
georgia
court?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
as
i
understand
that
position,
they
claim
only
to
this
discriminatory
and
its
effect.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
do
not
understand
their
contention
to
be
that
there's
been
an
in
discriminatory
application
of
the
doctrine
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
absolutely
not.
your
honor,
i
think
as
we've
developed
fully
in
our
brief
the
holding
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
with
respect
to
cy
pres
is
completely
consistent
with
the
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
in
the
state
and
the
state
supreme
court
apply
the
cy
pres
doctrine
as
we
read
the
decision
in
as
i
understand
what
they
did
totally
without
regard
to
the
racial
limitation
being
a
feature
in
this
instance.
it
was
simply
an
application
of
state
law
to
a
will
drawn
by
georgia
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
the
will
particular
the
language
which
are
quoted
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
are
saying,
that
not
just
a
purpose
but
the
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
the
will
was
to
provide
for
the
park
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor.
we'll
further
develop
that.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
said
the
sole
purpose
was
the
operation
of
a
park
for
white
citizens
on
racially
restricted
basis
and
furthermore,
that
under
georgia
law
which
i
take
is
also
a
general
law
but
at
least
a
state
law
that
the
cy
pres
doctrine
can
never
be
applied
in
a
way
to
defeat
the
intention
of
the
testament.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
think
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
decision
was
based
simply
on
the
language
with
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
in
addition
to
saying
the
sole
purpose,
it
was
further
stated
to
be
use
exclusively
by
them
and
so
forth.
and
then
the
spelling
out
of
senator
bacons
personal
and
social
philosophy
that
he
was
fundamentally
opposed
to
the
mixing
of
the
races.
and
finally,
the
underscoring
of
this
entire
motivation
with
the
reference
to
the
his
two
decease
sons
and
the
use
enjoyment
of
members
their
race
only
of
this
park.
i'm
not
seeking
to
justify
that
philosophy
but
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
all
of
that
language
together
on
the
settled
principles
of
state
law
as
manifesting
the
sole
and
indivisible
purpose.
but
did
not
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
are
you
asking
me
sir
if
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
think
they
took
that
approach
at
all.
i
think
they
look
solely
to
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
under
state
law
your
honor,
by
looking
to
the
language
of
the
will
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
approach.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
think
it
divides
into
two
branches.
mr.
justice
white
first
of
all
i
think
the
inquiry
of
the
state
supreme
court
laws.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
trust
as
expressed
by
the
creator
himself?
and
secondly,
having
ascertained
what
that
purpose
was
could
operate
be
applied?
they
concluded
first
of
all
that
the
sole
purpose
was
i've
stated
and
secondly,
that
under
the
georgia
cy
pres
statute.
cy
pres
applies
only
first
of
all
where
there
is
a
general
charitable
intent
and
where
there
is
simply
a
failure
of
the
mode
of
carrying
that
intend
into
effect
and
secondly,
cy
pres
is
never
applied
where
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
intention
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
believe
it.
obviously,
i
can't
speak
with
authority
with
respect
to
the
cy
pres
law
of
any
other
state.
but
i
don't
interpret
the
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
as
being
what
you
just
suggested.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
i
supposed
and
all
can
do
would
be
a
question
of
degree.
that
if
there
is
a
slight
inability
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
a
trust
that
would
be
one
matter.
but
the
georgia
supreme
court
felt
it
from
the
language
that
we
use
very
precisely
and
fully
by
senator
bacon.
that
the
assembly
was
a
total
failure
of
carrying
out
of
this
trust
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton
that
is
it
was
impossible
to
operate
a
racially
restricted
park
and
if
that
was
a
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
the
creator
of
the
trust.
i
don't
think
they'd
all
directed
the
inquire
to
what
senator
bacons
faults
or
intention
may
have
been
50
years
later,
if
he
had
been
a
way
of
a
change
of
social
philosophy
and
a
change
of
illegal
rulings
as
well.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
they
did
appear
on
that
case.
they
have
appeared
on
both
occasions
since
the
case
went
back
from
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
there
was
no
oral
argument
before
the
court
and
briefs
was
submitted
or
memorandum
was
submitted
by
the
parties
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
and
somewhat
on
–
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
i'm
a
little
uncertain
to
the
exact
position
that
was
taken
by
counsel
with
petitioners
at
that
time
perhaps
mr.
nabrit
could
respond
to
that.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
,
sir
not
the
slightest
in
our
judgments.
dealing
with
the
questions
one
by
one
very
briefly.
we
submit,
first
of
all,
that
all
of
the
petitioners
contentions
in
this
case
ignore
the
distinction
that
must
made
between
the
federal
question
of
the
manner
in
which
the
park
would
have
to
be
operated
if
it
continued
in
existence
as
a
park.
and
the
state
law
questions
involving
the
construction
of
senator
bacon
will.
as
we
see
it,
the
federal
interest
of
petitioners
is
simply
that
if
baconsfield
will
continued
an
operation
as
a
park.
it
would
have
to
be
operated
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
by
whoever
save
this
trustee
in
obedience
to
evans
versus
newton.
there
is
no
basis
in
evans
versus
newton
as
we
read
it
on
the
other
hand
or
any
other
decision
of
this
court
for
petitioner's
argument
that
there
is
an
additional
federal
requirement
that
the
state
courts
must
construed
senator
bacon
will
and
an
amount
of
it
will
resolved
in
baconsfield
continuing
as
a
park.
when
such
a
construction
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
clear
expression
of
the
testator
himself.
as
we
understand
the
proud
decision
of
this
court,
the
construction
of
a
will
and
the
determination
of
the
matter
of
reversion
or
state
law
questions
to
be
determined
by
state
courts.
as
responded
out
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
descending
opinion
on
evans
versus
newton.
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
power
of
the
state
to
decide
such
a
question
that
of
reversion
has
been
taken
for
granted
and
every
proud
opinion
in
this
court
is
ever
written
in
touching
the
subject.
we
ask
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
in
its
some
exceptions
senator
bacons
private
property.
it
never
became
‘public
property”.
it
was
left
and
trust
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
a
limited
class
of
persons.
the
racial
limitation
was
a
product
exclusively
of
senator
bacons
personal
social
philosophy
and
not
that
of
the
city
or
state.
as
we
see
it
when
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
by
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
before
it
two
facts
that
were
controlling
upon
it.
first
of
all,
this
court
that
held
at
baconsfield
could
not
be
operated
in
accordance
with
the
racial
restriction
contained
in
senator
bacons
will
by
anyone
its
trustee.
and
secondly,
the
will
itself
is
clear
that
he
wanted
a
park
operated
only
in
accordance
with
the
racial
restriction
and
not
otherwise
that
was
further
found
as
a
matter
of
an
interpretation
of
the
will
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
i
understood
mr.
nabrit
to
say
to
the
court
yesterday
that
he
conceded
that
the
sole
purpose
of
senator
bacon
was
the
operation
of
a
park
on
racially
restricted
basis.
but
he
has
sought
to
develop
the
thesis
that
two
purposes
can
be
found.
one
a
preeminent
park;
and
secondly,
a
racially
restricted
park.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
understand
this
argument
to
be
that,
yes.
but
its
base
on
that
to
abiding
the
purposes
and
into
two
parts
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
there
was
a
purpose
to
have
a
park
for
whites
only.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
if
i
may
respectfully
disagree.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
we
interpret
the
will
not
as
saying
two
things
but
is
saying
one
thing
and
that
is
the
operation
of
a
park
only
for
white
persons
and
not
with
the
mixing
of
the
races.
not
to
tell
what
two
purpose
is
one
to
have
a
park
for
whites,
and
secondly,
a
purpose
that
there
not
be
a
mixing
of
the
races
in
the
park
but
a
single
indivisible
purpose.
and
that
was
a
construction
and
interpretation
of
the
will
placed
upon
it
on
the
state
law
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
face
as
we
see
at
with
the
impossibility
of
reconciling
those
two
facts.
the
supreme
court
then
held
or
georgia
held
that
on
the
state
law
that
trust
had
failed
and
the
property
had
reverted.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state
supreme
court
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
racial
discrimination
as
such
because
that
issue
was
eliminated
by
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
holding
the
park
could
no
longer
be
operated
on
accordance
with
the
racial
limitation.
we
disagree
very
strongly
with
the
statement
in
their
brief
and
i
believe
mr.
nabrit
repeated
this
in
oral
argument
that
the
georgia
decision
might
be
sided,
“for
the
proposition
that
state
court
may
generally
decree
reversion
of
properties
for
a
breach
of
a
racial
condition.”
it
seems
to
us
that
by
that
argument
they
forget
that
this
should
not
involve
property
of
pledge
to
a
subject
to
a
racial
condition
nor
doesn't
involve
property
that
was
originally
perfect
nor
does
involve
property
between
public
properties
in
the
full
sense
of
that
time.
it
was
an
inception
of
senator
bacon's
property
and
it
is
fundamental
as
we
understand
the
law
that
a
person
who
creates
a
charitable
trust
may
condition
the
use
of
his
property.
we
do
not
argue
with
the
testator
can
require
that
its
property
be
use
in
a
manner
contrary
to
law.
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
say
that
this
property
may
not
be
use
in
a
manner
of
violating
above
the
expressed
conditions
or
imposed
upon
the
use
of
a
property.
but
under
those
circumstances,
there
would
be
a
failure
of
the
trust
and
the
property
would
go
according
to
whatever
the
applicable
law
of
this
state
might
be.
it
seems
to
us
further
that
that
contention
that
negroes
might
be
discourages
by
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
from
asserting
their
rights
as
a
hollow
argument.
this
was
not
again
public
property
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
time.
it
was
trust
property.
the
use
of
which
was
subject
to
condition
set
for
in
the
senator
bacon's
will.
as
a
practical
matter
furthermore,
it
seems
to
us
unlikely
that
there
is
a
similar
situation
in
existence
anyway
on
the
country
and
more
over,
the
georgia
decision
could
hardly
encourage
some
of
the
testamentary
trust
because
evans
versus
newton
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
establishing
that
first
of
all
a
person
cannot
effectively
device
all
conveyors
property
to
municipal
corporation
and
trust
where
racial
condition.
and
secondly,
a
municipality
cannot
accept
such
a
trust
to
his
trustee.
so,
we
don't
see
have
a
decision
of
the
georgia
court
which
is
an
obedience
to
that
mandate
of
this
court
could
be
set
in
any
respect
to
encourage
similar
or
racially
oriented
testamentary
trust.
as
we
understand
the
effect
of
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
petitioners.
they
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
not
in
applying
federal
law
but
in
its
determination
and
application
of
state
law.
i'd
like
to
comment
specifically
on
that
in
more
detailed
and
just
a
moment
in
replying
to
the
argument
of
mr.
claiborne
for
the
united
states.
finally
with
reference
to
this
branch
in
my
argument,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
mere
recognition
by
the
state's
supreme
court
that
the
trust
is
failed
does
not
end
of
itself
constitute
impermissible
state
action.
the
fact
that
the
georgia
court
run
to
decision
which
is
not
in
accord
with
the
contention
of
the
petitioners,
doesn't
mean
in
and
out
itself
that
the
state
has
denied
them
any
constitutionally
protected
rights.
as
we
see
it
one
must
have
a
right
before
it
can
be
denied
and
neither
the
negro
citizens
nor
the
whites
citizens
of
the
city
of
macon
have
the
right
on
the
federal
state
law
to
require
that
bacons
property
be
use
as
an
integrated
park
in
direct
violation
of
the
expressed
terms
of
his
will.
we
don't
believe
at
persons
belonging
to
a
particular
class
or
group
or
religion
may
create
rights
simply
by
setting
claims
in
the
state
court
and
having
them
denied
and
as
we
see
it
that
is
the
effect
of
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
present
case.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
rather
than
resigning
as
trustee?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
think
the
posture
of
the
case
would
still
be
the
same
when
it
got
back
to
the
supreme
court
following
evans
versus
newton.
if
the
trial
court
originally
had
same
feat
to
remove
the
city
as
trustee
in
voluntarily.
if
the
trial
court
had
removed
the
city
in
voluntarily
and
this
case
had
come
to
the
court
as
indeed
an
evans
versus
newton.
the
same
result
would
have
taken
place
that
is
a
holding
that
the
park
could
not
be
operated
as
a
racially
restricted
park.
i
don't
believe
the
court
meant
to
suggest
in
evans
versus
newton
that
the
city
could
be
compelled
to
save
his
trustee
against
his
wishes.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
we
do
not
take
that
position
and
don't
feel
that
that's
what
been
done
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
think
in
view
of
the
holding
in
evans
versus
newton
that
that
would
have
been
the
effect
of
it.
yes,
because
this
court
is
now
establish
to
the
law
of
this
case
that
the
park
cannot
be
operated
either
by
the
city
or
by
private
trustees
and
according
to
the
racial
restriction.
and
that
being
so,
i
think
their
involuntarily
removal
of
the
city
as
trustee
would
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
have
been
impermissible
state
action.
we
are
not
seeing
this
as
involving
state
action
at
all,
however,
and
what
took
place
following
evans
versus
newton
because
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
whether
not
the
trust
had
fail
and
that
event
what
happen
on
the
state.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
in
the
final
analysis,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
resignation
was
voluntarily
and
it
makes
any
difference
on
the
question
that
are
now
presented
to
the
court
because
in
like
ultimately
the
question,
same
question
would
have
risk
in
either
one
of
them.
first
of
all
the
purpose
of
the
trust
that
failed
and
secondly
and
so
what
happened
to
the
property
on
the
state
law.
with
reference
to
the
cy
pres
doctrine
itself,
again,
i've
largely
set
forth
my
thoughts
and
response
to
questions
about
it.
but
again,
i
would
make
the
point
that
the
only
concern
of
the
state
supreme
court
was
rather
the
use
of
the
park
by
negroes
would
violate
bacon's
restriction.
as
a
matter
of
his
personal
social
philosophy,
he
expressed
the
purpose
set
forth
in
this
trust.
as
we
see
it
the
argument
of
cy
pres
is
directly
contrary
to
state
law
and
has
been
so
held
by
the
state
supreme
court
based
on
the
two
propositions
i
mentioned.
first
of
all,
cy
pres
is
applied
only
where
there
is
a
general
charitable
intent
and
a
failure
of
the
mode
of
execution
of
it.
and
secondly,
on
the
state
law
is
never
applied
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
will
answer
that
this
way
that
the
will
settled
principles
of
state
law
or
two
codes
sections
which
obviously
set
forth
the
law
of
the
state
as
clearly
as
possible.
secondly,
we
know
of
no
case
factually
related
that
it
is
all
some
of
this
under
the
law
of
georgia.
but
i
take
it
that
the
best
authority
would
be
one
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
held
itself
with
respect
to
this
very
of
question
phrase.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
would
assume
that
to
be
the
most
respectable
possible
authority
that
we
could
site
to
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
we
disagree
with
that
most
strongly
if
it
suggests
novelty
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
i
think
its
noble
only
in
the
factual
situation
that
was
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir,
that
is
it
exactly
and
i
think
that
argument
is
well
founded,
first
of
all,
in
the
language
of
the
will
itself;
and
secondly,
the
will
has
been
so
interpreted
on
the
rules
of
construction
by
the
state
supreme
court.
but
there
was
a
single
sole
indivisible
exclusive
purpose
and
it
would
not
be
possible
now
to
operate
the
park
without
doing
so
directly
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
senator
bacon's
will.
and
at
that
and
that
alone
is
a
reason
trust
failed
under
the
state
law.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
obviously,
that
made
a
difference
in
evans
versus
newton.
i
don't
think
it
make
a
difference
in
applying
the
rules
of
state
law.
it
would
apply
on
remand
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
any
part
of
the
will,
eventhough,
it
may
have
become
constitutionally
impermissible
because
of
decisions
of
this
court.
still
on
the
set
of
rules
of
construction
had
becomes
the
burden
of
the
state
court
to
determine
first
of
all
the
purpose
of
the
creator;
and
secondly,
if
that
purpose
has
failed
and
specified
whether
or
not
cy
pres
could
be
applied
and
they
resolved
both
of
those
questions
unfavorably
to
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
this
dissenting
opinion,
so
far
as
he
had
found
at
that
time
there
has
been
no
proud
to
say
into
this
court
questioning
the
fact
that
the
matter
of
reversion
is
a
state
law
of
question.
i've
--
we've
decided
in
our
briefs
other
cases
to
the
same
effects
such
as
a
holding
of
this
court
in
marsh
versus
alabama
were
the
appoint
was
made
on
a
footnote
very
effectively
lived
dedication
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
state
law
question
that
is
whether
there
was
a
dedication
of
this
and
so
of
the
extent
of
dedication.
and
as
our
position
and
answer
that
question
that
those
are
state
law
questions.
my
time
is
about
up
soon
if
i
could
take
the
last
remaining
moment
to
reply
briefly
to
the
contentions
of
mr.
claiborne.
we
received
that
memorandum
only
this
passed
out
of
the
end.
i
would
respectfully
request
leave
to
make
brief
written
response
to
it.
we
have
no
opportunity
to
do
so
proud
to
the
hearing
of
yesterday
and
today.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
secondly,
as
we
see
it
the
entire
burden
of
the
memorandum
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
is
at
this
court
should
not
accept
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court
as
to
what
a
state
law
but
instead
should
make
its
own
independent
determination
of
what
is
state
law.
as
we
see
it
that
would
be
an
ultimately
if
it's
followed
to
its
logical
conclusion
destructive
of
the
state
judicial
assistance.
as
we
see
it
all
of
the
proud
decisions
of
this
court
if
recognized
as
on
state
law
questions
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
will
be
accepted
by
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
i'll
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
for
the
respondents
can
be
stated
very
simply
i
believe.
senator
bacon
devised
his
property
in
trust
with
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
white
women
and
children
of
the
city
of
macon.
this
court
decided
in
evans
versus
newton
that
baconsfield
cannot
be
operated
in
accordance
with
that
racial
restriction,
either
by
the
city
of
macon
is
trustee
or
by
private
trustees,
excepting
and
acting
in
accordance
with
that
decision.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
then
held
that
under
state
law,
the
sole
purpose
for
which
this
trust
was
created
applying
several
rules
of
construction
under
state
law
had
failed
that
the
trust
terminated
for
that
reason
without
regard
to
the
racial
limitation
in
the
slightest.
and
because
of
a
state
statute
providing
that
whenever
a
trust
failed
for
any
reason,
a
resulting
lack
of
trust
is
implied
for
the
benefit
of
the
donor
or
testator
or
his
heirs
because
of
that
statute
again
having
nothing
to
do
with
race
or
discrimination
in
any
respect,
this
property
reverts
under
state
law
back
to
the
heirs.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
it
is
a
statute
of
long
vintage.
it's
certainly
predated
1911
when
this
will
was
made.
so
far
as
i
know
its
been
in
the
georgia
law
for
a
hundred
years
or
more.
i
could
get
the
exact
date
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
it.
it's
a
statute
of
long-standing.
so
our
position
may
it
please
the
court,
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
involved
nothing
more
than
the
application
of
state
law
to
a
state
will
and
is
completely
consistent
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
evans
versus
newton.
we
say
that
no
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
been
denied
and
respectfully
urge
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
decision
should
be
availed.
i'll
complete
my
argument
tomorrow
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
attempting
to
reply
in
detail
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
the
assistance
list
to
general.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
record,
particularly,
because
when
this
case
was
here
before
there
was
no
factual
record
before
the
court.
it
seems
to
us,
first
of
all,
that
the
exact
language
of
either
man
of
senator
bacon's
will
is
of
great
importance
to
every
question
which
is
presented
in
this
litigation.
after
first
directing
that
this
property
something
over
a
hundred
acres
originally,
beheld
entrust
for
the
benefit
of
his
wife
and
two
daughters
during
their
lifetimes.
senator
bacon
then
provided
following
the
death
of
the
last
of
them
for
the
creation
of
this
charitable
trust.
using
the
following
language
and
with
the
indulgence
i
quote
“entrust
for
the
sole,
perpetual
and
on
and
then
use
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
the
white
women,
white
girls,
white
boys,
and
white
children
of
the
city
of
macon
to
be
by
them
forever
use
then
enjoyed
us
a
park
and
pleasure
ground
subject
to
the
restrictions
government,
management
rules
and
control
of
the
board
of
managers
is
here
enough
to
provide
it
for.”
the
said
property
onto
no
circumstances
or
at
any
time
for
any
reason
devoted
to
any
other
purpose
or
use
except
in
so
far
as
here
ends
specifically
authorized.
he
further
stated
and
i
quote,
“i
thank
occasion
to
say
that
i'm
limiting
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
this
property
perpetually
to
white
people.
i
am
not
influenced
by
any
on
kindness
or
feeling
or
one
of
consideration
for
the
negroes.
i
am
however
without
hesitation
and
the
opinion
that
are
in
the
social
relations
for
two
races
white
and
negro
should
be
forever
suffered
and
that
they
should
not
have
pleasure
or
recreation
grounds
to
be
use
or
enjoyed
together
and
in
common.”
in
family,
in
explaining
the
motivation
for
this
request
senator
bacon
stated
first
of
all
that
it
was
in
appreciation
to
the
citizens
of
macon
a
propaganda
that
had
been
bestowed
upon
him.
but
especially,
it
was
a
memorial
to
his
two
decease
sons.
using
the
language,
i
should
at
the
same
time
link
their
memories
with
the
pleasures
and
enjoyments
of
the
women
and
children
and
girls
and
boys
of
there
own
race
in
the
community
of
which
they
once
belong
to
happy
the
part.
now,
we
submit
that
senator
bacons
purpose
and
intent
was
stated
as
clearly
as
is
possible
in
the
english
language.
there
are
no
conflicts
or
inconsistencies
in
this
language.
he
spelled
out
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only
and
that
was
the
operation
of
a
park
on
a
racially
restricted
basis
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
white
citizens
or
segment
of
them
of
the
city
of
macon.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
it
was
provided,
your
honor,
that
with
the
permission
on
of
the
board
of
managers
which
how
speak
about
in
just
a
moment
that
white
men
and
the
community
would
be
permitted
to
use
authority.
that
was
a
discretionary
use
so
in
the
discretion
of
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir,
i
think
of
fast
statement
is
that
the
record
indicates
that
white
men
were
permitted
over
the
years
to
use
authority
freely
without
restriction.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
argument
that
there
with
two
purposes.
a
preeminent
park
on
the
one
hand
and
a
park
only
for
white
persons
on
the
other
simply
cannot
be
supported
by
any
fair
reading
of
the
language
of
the
will
itself.
next,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
briefly
to
the
matter
of
city
control
of
the
park.
it
seems
to
us
that
opposing
counsel
have
attempted
to
create
the
impression
that
the
city
of
macon
somehow
round
up
with
a
matter
to
this
simple
ownership
of
this
property.
we
say
the
record
not
only
fails
to
support
this
conclusion
but
clearly
shows
a
contrary
was
true.
to
begin
with,
all
though
senator
bacon
and
the
will
named
the
city
of
macon
as
the
trustee
and
authorized
it
to
appoint
the
first
board
of
managers.
he
gave
the
city
no
power
or
whatever
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
park.
instead,
he
provided
that
the
seven
member
board
of
managers
which
would
be
a
self
perpetuating
body
accepted
only
to
the
right
of
the
city
to
confirm
any
successor
appointment
to
that
board,
“shall
at
all
times
they
have
complete
an
unrestricted
control
and
management
of
the
said
property
with
power
to
make
all
need
for
regulations
for
the
preservation
and
improvement
of
the
same
and
rules
for
the
use
and
enjoyment
there
on.
with
power
to
exclude
it
anytime,
any
place
on
all
person
of
either
sex
and
maybe
deemed
objectionable
on
whose
conduct
or
character
made
by
said
board
be
a
judge
or
considered
objectionable
or
such
as
to
render
for
any
reason
and
the
judgment
of
said
board.
their
presence
and
said
grounds
inconsistent
with
on
prejudicial
that
a
proper
and
law
successful
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
same
for
the
purposes
here
in
contemplated.”
again,
it
seems
to
us
that
by
the
clearest
possible
language
senator
bacon
best
total
control
of
the
operation
of
the
park
not
in
the
city
of
macon
but
in
this
independent
group
of
private
citizens.
he
authorized
the
board,
furthermore,
to
use
a
portion
of
the
property
lying
to
the
east
of
a
street
man
owners
north
avenue
“in
any
amount
of
they
may
deem
best”
for
producing
income
to
defray
expenses
connected
with
the
operation
management
and
preservation
of
the
property
and
in
various
other
way
is
given
total
and
absolute
control.
the
board
of
managers
was
not
made
answerable
at
any
way
of
a
city
and
the
city
had
no
authority
to
remove
any
member
of
the
board
or
otherwise
to
exercise
supervision
over
at
in
any
way.
the
record
further
shows
that
the
board
of
managers
did
in
fact
exercise
complete
management
that
control
exactly
as
contemplated
by
senator
bacon.
the
record
include
detailed
the
minutes
of
many
leadings
of
the
board
over
a
period
of
30
years
in
which
the
most
minute
matters
were
carefully
considered
and
decided.
the
record
shows
a
city
that
did
nothing
without
the
authorization
and
approval
of
the
board.
the
serious
conduct
in
interest
in
baconsfield
were
at
all
times
completely
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
holder
of
the
naked
legal
title.
in
no
time
that
the
city
treat
the
property
as
being
“public
property”
as
it
has
been
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
opposing
counsel.
the
city
did
not
treat
this
property
in
the
same
way
at
all
that
the
city
treated
the
40
or
50
other
city
parks
which
won
in
free
sample
by
city.
i
think
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
swimming
pool
has
been
referred
to
in
this
case
before
it
was
handled.
the
land
on
which
this
pool
was
constructed
was
not
in
the
park
proper
but
in
the
income
producing
area
lying
to
the
east
of
what
is
now
known
as
north
avenue.
the
pool
was
constructed
in
1948.
it
was
constructed
on
a
property
that
was
leased
by
the
board
of
managers
to
the
city
of
macon.
copy
of
the
lease
is
in
the
record.
i
think
of
reference
to
it
clearly
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
standard
lease
similar
to
the
other
types
of
leases
of
property
and
income
producing
area.
the
lease
capital
resides
that
the
premises
and
the
pool
to
be
constructed
by
the
city
shall
be
use
and
operated
in
accordance
with
item
9
of
senator
bacons
will.
and
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
of
managers
and
it
was
provided
that
the
board
contaminate
the
agreement
in
the
event
of
a
breach
not
corrected
within
five
days
after
written
notice.
i'll
take
it
a
self
evident
that
if
the
city
of
macon
at
ever
--at
any
time
regarded
this
as
being
public
property
in
the
sense
in
which
that
expression
has
been
use
in
the
brief
of
opposing
counsel.
there
would
never
had
been
in
any
such
a
lease
arrangement
is
that
why
that
with
respect
to
the
swimming
pool.
counsel
has
suggested
in
this
case
that
there
is
some
significance
of
a
special
nature
to
the
1920
deed
that's
been
referred
to.
i
think
as
we've
pointed
out
completely
in
our
brief
that
that
had
absolutely
no
effect
upon
the
nature
of
the
interest
of
a
city.
it
was
provided
as
i
pointed
out
that
the
charitable
trust
would
not
come
into
being
until
after
the
death
of
the
survivor
of
senator
bacon's
widow
and
two
children.
and
the
sold
papers
as
the
record
clearly
shows
of
a
1920
deed
was
to
make
it
possible
for
the
vesting
of
possession
in
the
city
as
trustee
to
commence
in
1920
rather
than
being
postponed
until
the
death
of
the
survivor
of
those
three
members
of
senator
bacon's
family.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
here
before
there
was
no
factual
record
of
any
kind
before
the
court.
there
was
nothing
specifically
to
show
the
extend
of
the
city
involvement
at
that
time.
in
consequently
the
assumption
is
recorded
in
the
majority
opinion
that
it
was
assumed
that
there
was
a
continuation
of
city
involvement
in
the
operation
of
the
park.
the
record
mail
before
the
court
is
a
fully
developed
record.
it
shows
clearly
and
without
contradiction
that
since
1964
when
the
city
of
macon
resigned
its
trustee
and
its
resignation
was
accepted
by
the
trial
court.
the
city
has
had
no
involvement
of
any
kind
or
character
with
baconsfield
park.
no
funds
had
been
provided.
no
city
employees
have
assisted
in
maintenance
or
preservation
has
been
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
of
involvement
or
a
connection
by
the
city
of
macon
with
the
operation
or
maintenance
of
this
park.
the
board
of
managers
since
1964
has
provided
all
of
the
funds
for
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
park
using
the
income
produced
from
the
leases
of
property
and
the
income
producing
area
for
that
purpose.
in
1968
to
complete
the
record
on
that
park,
receivers
were
appointed
by
the
trial
court
and
a
continuing
to
operate
the
park
gestures
of
the
board
of
managers
had
done
part
of
that
time
pending
the
final
outcome
of
this
litigation.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honors
as
we
now
estimated
that's
about
50
to
60
acres
of
substantial
portion
of
the
acre.
it
was
taken
by
a
condemnation
for
an
understate
highway.
that
50
to
60
acres,
we
believe
includes
not
only
the
park
property
proper
but
also
the
income
producing
area
of
some
5
to
10
acres
lying
to
the
east
of
north
avenue.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
that
money
was
received
by
the
board
of
managers
and
expressed
with
being
held
by
the
receivers
appointed
by
the
trial
court
pending
the
final
disposition
of
this
litigation.
now
with
respect
to
the
city
and
the
park
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
that
is
perhaps
the
sole
exception
to
the
statement
that
i
made.
it
is
correct
that
mr.
nabrit
and
mr.
claiborne
had
pointed
out.
that
certain
representations
were
made
in
documents
furnished
by
the
city
of
macon
in
connection
with
the
wpa
financing.
as
to
why
that
happened
or
the
circumstances
that
surrounding
it,
the
record
itself.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
board
of
managers
in
any
way
authorized
or
consented
to
those
representations
by
the
city
and
save
and
accept
that
sole
dealing
with
the
federal
government.
i
know
of
no
enters
in
this
record
in
which
the
city
has
treated
this
as
public
property.
certainly
as
far
as
in
relations
between
the
city
and
the
board
of
managers
are
concerned,
every
action
of
the
city
has
been
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
trustee
and
with
the
recognition
of
complete
control
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
the
board
of
managers
has
been
in
charged
of
the
improvements.
it
is
correct
as
the
record
shows
that
city
employees
have
assisted
in
the
operation
and
preservation
of
the
park
and
city
farms
of
obviously
to
that
extent
were
involve.
at
the
same
time,
the
board
of
managers
as
i
was
about
to
point
out
in
connection
with
pre
1964
involvement
have
utilized
perhaps
$100,000.00
or
i
think
you're
right
in
that
neighborhood
of
money
made
available
from
the
income
producing
property
also
for
the
preservation
and
maintenance
of
the
park.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
very
difficult
to
the
term
when
precisely
from
the
record
but
i
was
about
to
make
a
statement
that
it
appears
that
at
least
50%
of
the
total
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
found
its
source
and
the
income
produce
from
the
income
producing
property
left
by
senator
bacon.
and
the
perhaps
50%
or
less
of
the
total
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
is
attributable
to
city
funds
directly
or
indirectly.
the
record
as
completed
this
as
is
simply
impossible
mathematically
to
determine
the
exact
percentage
of
support
from
the
city
and
from
the
board
of
managers.
in
our
view
of
the
evidences
as
to
pre
1964
involvement
by
the
city
is
largely
immaterial
to
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case.
and
i
mention
these
facts
solely
because
in
our
judgment
with
due
respect
opposing
counsel
if
greatly
over
emphasized
the
extent
in
nature
of
that
involvement.
it
is
true
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
wpa
funds
were
made
available
in
1935
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
park
and
cities
labor
was
made
available
thereafter
for
a
period
of
perhaps
30
years
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
park.
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
as
the
record
shows
that
this
property
consists
largely
of
grass
and
strawberry
and
trees.
well
over
50%
out
of
it
or
at
least
50%
is
in
trees.
the
only
structure
of
any
kind
on
the
property
other
than
in
the
income
producing
area
to
the
east
of
north
avenue
is
the
club
house
that
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel
in
the
argument
yesterday.
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
during
the
same
period
perhaps
a
$100,000.00
of
income
attributable
to
senator
bacons
own
the
quest
has
also
been
use
in
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
park.
we
would
also
direct
the
courts
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
in
1920
when
the
early
vesting
of
possession
in
the
city
was
agreed
upon
at
that
same
time
$13,000.00
in
bonds
and
interest
that
had
been
left
by
senator
bacon
for
this
purpose
were
turned
over
to
the
city.
and
the
city
agreed
to
make
a
5%
annual
payment
on
the
$13,000.00
or
$650.00.
i
think
this
is
of
significance
in
the
total
picture
i
would
calculate
that
the
amount
of
the
principal
and
interest
of
the
bonds
that
were
turned
over
to
the
city
in
1920,
plus
the
5%
payments
that
it
was
obligated
to
make
went
over
the
year
have
amounted
to
about
$43,000.00.
so
that
to
that
extent
that
part
of
the
city
involvement
is
attributable
directly
to
funds
left
by
senator
bacon
himself
four
years
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
property.
that
in
addition
to
the
about
$100,000.00
it
came
from
the
income
on
the
income
producing
property
to
the
east.
finally
with
respect
to
that
evidence,
again
i'll
make
the
statement
that
the
record
never
shows
in
anyway
that
the
city
is
sole
to
exercise
control
in
its
dealings
with
the
board
of
managers.
but
instead
everything
that
it
did
in
those
dealings
was
entirely
consistent
with
its
limited
status
as
hold
her
own
leave
the
naked
legal
title
recognizing
complete
control
on
the
board
of
managers.
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
three
occasions.
twice
seems
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
shortly
after
evans
versus
newton
was
handed
down
in
march
of
1966,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
at
the
sole
purpose
for
which
the
trust
was
created
has
become
impossible
of
accomplishment
and
has
been
terminated.
this
being
based
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton
that
it
was
impossible
for
senator
bacons
trust
to
be
carried
out
on
the
court
with
a
racial
restriction.
to
respond
that
held
by
the
supreme
court
that
a
resulting
trust
under
a
georgia
statute
was
implied
for
the
benefit
of
the
heirs
of
the
testator.
incidentally,
i
checked
on
that
statute
suggest
today
and
i
find
that
it's
been
in
the
georgia
law
at
least
since
the
code
of
1863
which
was
the
earliest
available
code
from
my
inspection.
so
far
as
i
know,
it's
purely
declaratory
of
the
common
law
and
has
been
in
the
georgia
code
since
the
first
code
was
prepared.
the
case
was
remanded
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
the
trial
court
for
determination
and
ask
to
who
were
the
heirs
of
senator
bacon.
in
the
third
and
final
appearance
of
this
case
before
the
state
supreme
court
in
december
1968,
the
decision
with
respect
towards
the
writ
was
granted.
the
supreme
court
reiterated
its
holding
that
the
trust
terminated
under
state
law.
noting
that
petitioners
had
sought
no
review
of
that
ruling
by
this
court.
he
held
further
that
the
cy
pres
doctrine
could
not
be
applied
on
the
georgia
law
and
rejected
various
other
contentions
of
petitioners
including
all
of
those
urge
before
the
court
yesterday
and
today.
it
held
that
in
short
applying
state
law
or
trust
created
under
a
georgia
will
and
relating
to
georgia
property
had
failed.
and
again
on
the
state
law,
the
property
had
reverted
to
the
heirs
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
perhaps
the
petition
also
answered.
is
there
any
contention
in
this
case
that
in
dealing
with
desired
first
statute
your
decide
first
statute
of
the
georgia
court
and
parted
when
the
courts
decision
as
doctrine
involved
when
the
general
under
georgia
law.
in
other
words,
is
there
any
contention
with
this
case
that
is
been
discriminatory
applications
aside
for
the
statute
of
the
georgia
court?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
as
i
understand
that
position,
they
claim
only
to
this
discriminatory
and
its
effect.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
do
not
understand
their
contention
to
be
that
there's
been
an
in
discriminatory
application
of
the
doctrine
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
absolutely
not.
your
honor,
i
think
as
we've
developed
fully
in
our
brief
the
holding
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
with
respect
to
cy
pres
is
completely
consistent
with
the
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
in
the
state
and
the
state
supreme
court
apply
the
cy
pres
doctrine
as
we
read
the
decision
in
as
i
understand
what
they
did
totally
without
regard
to
the
racial
limitation
being
a
feature
in
this
instance.
it
was
simply
an
application
of
state
law
to
a
will
drawn
by
georgia
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
the
will
particular
the
language
which
are
quoted
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
are
saying,
that
not
just
a
purpose
but
the
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
the
will
was
to
provide
for
the
park
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor.
we'll
further
develop
that.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
they
said
the
sole
purpose
was
the
operation
of
a
park
for
white
citizens
on
racially
restricted
basis
and
furthermore,
that
under
georgia
law
which
i
take
is
also
a
general
law
but
at
least
a
state
law
that
the
cy
pres
doctrine
can
never
be
applied
in
a
way
to
defeat
the
intention
of
the
testament.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
think
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
decision
was
based
simply
on
the
language
with
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
in
addition
to
saying
the
sole
purpose,
it
was
further
stated
to
be
use
exclusively
by
them
and
so
forth.
and
then
the
spelling
out
of
senator
bacons
personal
and
social
philosophy
that
he
was
fundamentally
opposed
to
the
mixing
of
the
races.
and
finally,
the
underscoring
of
this
entire
motivation
with
the
reference
to
the
his
two
decease
sons
and
the
use
enjoyment
of
members
their
race
only
of
this
park.
i'm
not
seeking
to
justify
that
philosophy
but
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
all
of
that
language
together
on
the
settled
principles
of
state
law
as
manifesting
the
sole
and
indivisible
purpose.
but
did
not
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
are
you
asking
me
sir
if
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
think
they
took
that
approach
at
all.
i
think
they
look
solely
to
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
under
state
law
your
honor,
by
looking
to
the
language
of
the
will
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
the
approach.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
think
it
divides
into
two
branches.
mr.
justice
white
first
of
all
i
think
the
inquiry
of
the
state
supreme
court
laws.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
trust
as
expressed
by
the
creator
himself?
and
secondly,
having
ascertained
what
that
purpose
was
could
operate
be
applied?
they
concluded
first
of
all
that
the
sole
purpose
was
i've
stated
and
secondly,
that
under
the
georgia
cy
pres
statute.
cy
pres
applies
only
first
of
all
where
there
is
a
general
charitable
intent
and
where
there
is
simply
a
failure
of
the
mode
of
carrying
that
intend
into
effect
and
secondly,
cy
pres
is
never
applied
where
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
intention
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
don't
believe
it.
obviously,
i
can't
speak
with
authority
with
respect
to
the
cy
pres
law
of
any
other
state.
but
i
don't
interpret
the
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
as
being
what
you
just
suggested.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
sir,
i
supposed
and
all
can
do
would
be
a
question
of
degree.
that
if
there
is
a
slight
inability
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
a
trust
that
would
be
one
matter.
but
the
georgia
supreme
court
felt
it
from
the
language
that
we
use
very
precisely
and
fully
by
senator
bacon.
that
the
assembly
was
a
total
failure
of
carrying
out
of
this
trust
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton
that
is
it
was
impossible
to
operate
a
racially
restricted
park
and
if
that
was
a
sole
and
exclusive
purpose
of
the
creator
of
the
trust.
i
don't
think
they'd
all
directed
the
inquire
to
what
senator
bacons
faults
or
intention
may
have
been
50
years
later,
if
he
had
been
a
way
of
a
change
of
social
philosophy
and
a
change
of
illegal
rulings
as
well.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
they
did
appear
on
that
case.
they
have
appeared
on
both
occasions
since
the
case
went
back
from
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
there
was
no
oral
argument
before
the
court
and
briefs
was
submitted
or
memorandum
was
submitted
by
the
parties
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
and
somewhat
on
–
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
i'm
a
little
uncertain
to
the
exact
position
that
was
taken
by
counsel
with
petitioners
at
that
time
perhaps
mr.
nabrit
could
respond
to
that.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no
,
sir
not
the
slightest
in
our
judgments.
dealing
with
the
questions
one
by
one
very
briefly.
we
submit,
first
of
all,
that
all
of
the
petitioners
contentions
in
this
case
ignore
the
distinction
that
must
made
between
the
federal
question
of
the
manner
in
which
the
park
would
have
to
be
operated
if
it
continued
in
existence
as
a
park.
and
the
state
law
questions
involving
the
construction
of
senator
bacon
will.
as
we
see
it,
the
federal
interest
of
petitioners
is
simply
that
if
baconsfield
will
continued
an
operation
as
a
park.
it
would
have
to
be
operated
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
by
whoever
save
this
trustee
in
obedience
to
evans
versus
newton.
there
is
no
basis
in
evans
versus
newton
as
we
read
it
on
the
other
hand
or
any
other
decision
of
this
court
for
petitioner's
argument
that
there
is
an
additional
federal
requirement
that
the
state
courts
must
construed
senator
bacon
will
and
an
amount
of
it
will
resolved
in
baconsfield
continuing
as
a
park.
when
such
a
construction
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
clear
expression
of
the
testator
himself.
as
we
understand
the
proud
decision
of
this
court,
the
construction
of
a
will
and
the
determination
of
the
matter
of
reversion
or
state
law
questions
to
be
determined
by
state
courts.
as
responded
out
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
descending
opinion
on
evans
versus
newton.
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
power
of
the
state
to
decide
such
a
question
that
of
reversion
has
been
taken
for
granted
and
every
proud
opinion
in
this
court
is
ever
written
in
touching
the
subject.
we
ask
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
in
its
some
exceptions
senator
bacons
private
property.
it
never
became
‘public
property”.
it
was
left
and
trust
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
a
limited
class
of
persons.
the
racial
limitation
was
a
product
exclusively
of
senator
bacons
personal
social
philosophy
and
not
that
of
the
city
or
state.
as
we
see
it
when
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
by
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
before
it
two
facts
that
were
controlling
upon
it.
first
of
all,
this
court
that
held
at
baconsfield
could
not
be
operated
in
accordance
with
the
racial
restriction
contained
in
senator
bacons
will
by
anyone
its
trustee.
and
secondly,
the
will
itself
is
clear
that
he
wanted
a
park
operated
only
in
accordance
with
the
racial
restriction
and
not
otherwise
that
was
further
found
as
a
matter
of
an
interpretation
of
the
will
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
itself.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
i
understood
mr.
nabrit
to
say
to
the
court
yesterday
that
he
conceded
that
the
sole
purpose
of
senator
bacon
was
the
operation
of
a
park
on
racially
restricted
basis.
but
he
has
sought
to
develop
the
thesis
that
two
purposes
can
be
found.
one
a
preeminent
park;
and
secondly,
a
racially
restricted
park.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
understand
this
argument
to
be
that,
yes.
but
its
base
on
that
to
abiding
the
purposes
and
into
two
parts
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
there
was
a
purpose
to
have
a
park
for
whites
only.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir.
if
i
may
respectfully
disagree.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
we
interpret
the
will
not
as
saying
two
things
but
is
saying
one
thing
and
that
is
the
operation
of
a
park
only
for
white
persons
and
not
with
the
mixing
of
the
races.
not
to
tell
what
two
purpose
is
one
to
have
a
park
for
whites,
and
secondly,
a
purpose
that
there
not
be
a
mixing
of
the
races
in
the
park
but
a
single
indivisible
purpose.
and
that
was
a
construction
and
interpretation
of
the
will
placed
upon
it
on
the
state
law
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
face
as
we
see
at
with
the
impossibility
of
reconciling
those
two
facts.
the
supreme
court
then
held
or
georgia
held
that
on
the
state
law
that
trust
had
failed
and
the
property
had
reverted.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
state
supreme
court
decision
had
nothing
to
do
with
racial
discrimination
as
such
because
that
issue
was
eliminated
by
this
court
and
evans
versus
newton.
holding
the
park
could
no
longer
be
operated
on
accordance
with
the
racial
limitation.
we
disagree
very
strongly
with
the
statement
in
their
brief
and
i
believe
mr.
nabrit
repeated
this
in
oral
argument
that
the
georgia
decision
might
be
sided,
“for
the
proposition
that
state
court
may
generally
decree
reversion
of
properties
for
a
breach
of
a
racial
condition.”
it
seems
to
us
that
by
that
argument
they
forget
that
this
should
not
involve
property
of
pledge
to
a
subject
to
a
racial
condition
nor
doesn't
involve
property
that
was
originally
perfect
nor
does
involve
property
between
public
properties
in
the
full
sense
of
that
time.
it
was
an
inception
of
senator
bacon's
property
and
it
is
fundamental
as
we
understand
the
law
that
a
person
who
creates
a
charitable
trust
may
condition
the
use
of
his
property.
we
do
not
argue
with
the
testator
can
require
that
its
property
be
use
in
a
manner
contrary
to
law.
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
say
that
this
property
may
not
be
use
in
a
manner
of
violating
above
the
expressed
conditions
or
imposed
upon
the
use
of
a
property.
but
under
those
circumstances,
there
would
be
a
failure
of
the
trust
and
the
property
would
go
according
to
whatever
the
applicable
law
of
this
state
might
be.
it
seems
to
us
further
that
that
contention
that
negroes
might
be
discourages
by
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
from
asserting
their
rights
as
a
hollow
argument.
this
was
not
again
public
property
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
time.
it
was
trust
property.
the
use
of
which
was
subject
to
condition
set
for
in
the
senator
bacon's
will.
as
a
practical
matter
furthermore,
it
seems
to
us
unlikely
that
there
is
a
similar
situation
in
existence
anyway
on
the
country
and
more
over,
the
georgia
decision
could
hardly
encourage
some
of
the
testamentary
trust
because
evans
versus
newton
is
now
the
law
of
the
land
establishing
that
first
of
all
a
person
cannot
effectively
device
all
conveyors
property
to
municipal
corporation
and
trust
where
racial
condition.
and
secondly,
a
municipality
cannot
accept
such
a
trust
to
his
trustee.
so,
we
don't
see
have
a
decision
of
the
georgia
court
which
is
an
obedience
to
that
mandate
of
this
court
could
be
set
in
any
respect
to
encourage
similar
or
racially
oriented
testamentary
trust.
as
we
understand
the
effect
of
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
petitioners.
they
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
not
in
applying
federal
law
but
in
its
determination
and
application
of
state
law.
i'd
like
to
comment
specifically
on
that
in
more
detailed
and
just
a
moment
in
replying
to
the
argument
of
mr.
claiborne
for
the
united
states.
finally
with
reference
to
this
branch
in
my
argument,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
mere
recognition
by
the
state's
supreme
court
that
the
trust
is
failed
does
not
end
of
itself
constitute
impermissible
state
action.
the
fact
that
the
georgia
court
run
to
decision
which
is
not
in
accord
with
the
contention
of
the
petitioners,
doesn't
mean
in
and
out
itself
that
the
state
has
denied
them
any
constitutionally
protected
rights.
as
we
see
it
one
must
have
a
right
before
it
can
be
denied
and
neither
the
negro
citizens
nor
the
whites
citizens
of
the
city
of
macon
have
the
right
on
the
federal
state
law
to
require
that
bacons
property
be
use
as
an
integrated
park
in
direct
violation
of
the
expressed
terms
of
his
will.
we
don't
believe
at
persons
belonging
to
a
particular
class
or
group
or
religion
may
create
rights
simply
by
setting
claims
in
the
state
court
and
having
them
denied
and
as
we
see
it
that
is
the
effect
of
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
present
case.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
rather
than
resigning
as
trustee?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
think
the
posture
of
the
case
would
still
be
the
same
when
it
got
back
to
the
supreme
court
following
evans
versus
newton.
if
the
trial
court
originally
had
same
feat
to
remove
the
city
as
trustee
in
voluntarily.
if
the
trial
court
had
removed
the
city
in
voluntarily
and
this
case
had
come
to
the
court
as
indeed
an
evans
versus
newton.
the
same
result
would
have
taken
place
that
is
a
holding
that
the
park
could
not
be
operated
as
a
racially
restricted
park.
i
don't
believe
the
court
meant
to
suggest
in
evans
versus
newton
that
the
city
could
be
compelled
to
save
his
trustee
against
his
wishes.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
no,
sir
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
we
do
not
take
that
position
and
don't
feel
that
that's
what
been
done
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
think
in
view
of
the
holding
in
evans
versus
newton
that
that
would
have
been
the
effect
of
it.
yes,
because
this
court
is
now
establish
to
the
law
of
this
case
that
the
park
cannot
be
operated
either
by
the
city
or
by
private
trustees
and
according
to
the
racial
restriction.
and
that
being
so,
i
think
their
involuntarily
removal
of
the
city
as
trustee
would
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
have
been
impermissible
state
action.
we
are
not
seeing
this
as
involving
state
action
at
all,
however,
and
what
took
place
following
evans
versus
newton
because
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
whether
not
the
trust
had
fail
and
that
event
what
happen
on
the
state.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
in
the
final
analysis,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
resignation
was
voluntarily
and
it
makes
any
difference
on
the
question
that
are
now
presented
to
the
court
because
in
like
ultimately
the
question,
same
question
would
have
risk
in
either
one
of
them.
first
of
all
the
purpose
of
the
trust
that
failed
and
secondly
and
so
what
happened
to
the
property
on
the
state
law.
with
reference
to
the
cy
pres
doctrine
itself,
again,
i've
largely
set
forth
my
thoughts
and
response
to
questions
about
it.
but
again,
i
would
make
the
point
that
the
only
concern
of
the
state
supreme
court
was
rather
the
use
of
the
park
by
negroes
would
violate
bacon's
restriction.
as
a
matter
of
his
personal
social
philosophy,
he
expressed
the
purpose
set
forth
in
this
trust.
as
we
see
it
the
argument
of
cy
pres
is
directly
contrary
to
state
law
and
has
been
so
held
by
the
state
supreme
court
based
on
the
two
propositions
i
mentioned.
first
of
all,
cy
pres
is
applied
only
where
there
is
a
general
charitable
intent
and
a
failure
of
the
mode
of
execution
of
it.
and
secondly,
on
the
state
law
is
never
applied
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
testator.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
will
answer
that
this
way
that
the
will
settled
principles
of
state
law
or
two
codes
sections
which
obviously
set
forth
the
law
of
the
state
as
clearly
as
possible.
secondly,
we
know
of
no
case
factually
related
that
it
is
all
some
of
this
under
the
law
of
georgia.
but
i
take
it
that
the
best
authority
would
be
one
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
held
itself
with
respect
to
this
very
of
question
phrase.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
would
assume
that
to
be
the
most
respectable
possible
authority
that
we
could
site
to
this
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
we
disagree
with
that
most
strongly
if
it
suggests
novelty
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
i
think
its
noble
only
in
the
factual
situation
that
was
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir,
that
is
it
exactly
and
i
think
that
argument
is
well
founded,
first
of
all,
in
the
language
of
the
will
itself;
and
secondly,
the
will
has
been
so
interpreted
on
the
rules
of
construction
by
the
state
supreme
court.
but
there
was
a
single
sole
indivisible
exclusive
purpose
and
it
would
not
be
possible
now
to
operate
the
park
without
doing
so
directly
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
senator
bacon's
will.
and
at
that
and
that
alone
is
a
reason
trust
failed
under
the
state
law.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
obviously,
that
made
a
difference
in
evans
versus
newton.
i
don't
think
it
make
a
difference
in
applying
the
rules
of
state
law.
it
would
apply
on
remand
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
don't
think
you
can
ignore
any
part
of
the
will,
eventhough,
it
may
have
become
constitutionally
impermissible
because
of
decisions
of
this
court.
still
on
the
set
of
rules
of
construction
had
becomes
the
burden
of
the
state
court
to
determine
first
of
all
the
purpose
of
the
creator;
and
secondly,
if
that
purpose
has
failed
and
specified
whether
or
not
cy
pres
could
be
applied
and
they
resolved
both
of
those
questions
unfavorably
to
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes,
sir.
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
this
dissenting
opinion,
so
far
as
he
had
found
at
that
time
there
has
been
no
proud
to
say
into
this
court
questioning
the
fact
that
the
matter
of
reversion
is
a
state
law
of
question.
i've
--
we've
decided
in
our
briefs
other
cases
to
the
same
effects
such
as
a
holding
of
this
court
in
marsh
versus
alabama
were
the
appoint
was
made
on
a
footnote
very
effectively
lived
dedication
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
state
law
question
that
is
whether
there
was
a
dedication
of
this
and
so
of
the
extent
of
dedication.
and
as
our
position
and
answer
that
question
that
those
are
state
law
questions.
my
time
is
about
up
soon
if
i
could
take
the
last
remaining
moment
to
reply
briefly
to
the
contentions
of
mr.
claiborne.
we
received
that
memorandum
only
this
passed
out
of
the
end.
i
would
respectfully
request
leave
to
make
brief
written
response
to
it.
we
have
no
opportunity
to
do
so
proud
to
the
hearing
of
yesterday
and
today.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
secondly,
as
we
see
it
the
entire
burden
of
the
memorandum
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
is
at
this
court
should
not
accept
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court
as
to
what
a
state
law
but
instead
should
make
its
own
independent
determination
of
what
is
state
law.
as
we
see
it
that
would
be
an
ultimately
if
it's
followed
to
its
logical
conclusion
destructive
of
the
state
judicial
assistance.
as
we
see
it
all
of
the
proud
decisions
of
this
court
if
recognized
as
on
state
law
questions
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
will
be
accepted
by
this
court.
