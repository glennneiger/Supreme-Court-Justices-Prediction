did
you
said
they
have
rule?
what
did
you
say
that
georgia
supreme
court
had
now
ruled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
what
consequence
do
they
say
that
trust
has
failed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
senator
bacon,
the
day
after
he
died,
this
court
had
ended
down
an
opinion
that
the
park
could
not
be
run
as
this
one
he
directed
it
be
run
and
his
heirs
had
two
days
later
raised
the
question
on
it
in
challenge.would
you
like
to
make
the
same
arguments
you
are
making
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
so
dedicated
to
the
public
that
it
couldn't
be
withdrawn.
i
think
that
argument
might
be
available
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
this
case
is
far
stronger
because
the
park
has
operated
for
half
a
century
as
a
public
facility
which
not
only
increases
the
injury
which
results
from
its
closure,
the
implications
involved
in
that
closure
on
account
of
race,
but
also
in
the
traditional
terms
of
the
cy
pres
doctrine,
the
effort
to
continue
a
will
which
has
taken
effect,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
some
time
is
recognized
as
being
much
stronger
than
in
the
event

you
mean
constitutional
this

what
provision
of

will
make
it
strong
there
to
you?
justice

how
long
is
that
statute
applied?

how
many
acres
of

in

who
got
the
money

condemn
property?
justice

i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
mr.
jones.
justice
hugo

black
yes,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
completely
if
one
note
to
go
of
the
georgia
cy
pres
decisions
which
were
discern
in
those
decisions
something
that
indicates
a
different
result
with
the
brief
been
reach
to
this
instance.
justice
hugo

may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
that.
justice

l.
black
judgment
at
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rendered
after
the
case
went
bad,
first
judgment.
did
you
say
that
those
who
have
contesting
this
now
did
not
appear
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
position
did
they
take
in
that
case?
justice

i
assume
that
wouldn't
change
the
aspect
to
the
legal
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
dispute
on
that
because
you
ask
for
that
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
two
questions
on
mr.
nabrit.
what
do
you
say
before
your
views
to
whether
or
not
these
holdings
to
the
state
of
georgia
cases
are
recommended
to
or
did
not
give
a
deviation
according
to
law?
justice
hugo
l.

well,
as
i
understand
at
georgia
courts
opinion
said
as
i
phrase
statute
didn't
come
in
to
play
at
all
because
under
georgia
law
given
the
provision
to
mr.
bacon's
will,
senator
bacon's
will,
there
you
were
selecting
the
general
charitable
purpose
and
my
question
is,
if
that
holding
represent
a
deviation
beside
georgia
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
just
have
one
other
question.
supposing
this
has
been
entirely
city
owned
property
and
run
no
desegregation
this
is
of
course
would
the
city
would
abandon
that
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
that
they'll
be
no
federal
right
involved
with
the
city
makes
abandon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
find
that
discriminatory
involvement
issues
hence
that
in
may
have
whether
that
you
would
say
that
did
regards
to
the
federal
court?

you
