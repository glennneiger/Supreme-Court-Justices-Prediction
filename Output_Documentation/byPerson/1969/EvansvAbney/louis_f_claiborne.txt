mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
relevant
that
this
case
is
both
a
wills
case
and
a
packs
case
neither
one
alone
but
both
together.
and
yet
it
is
not
a
case
about
how
to
construe
a
will
nor
is
it
even
a
case
about
which
restrictions
in
wills
should
be
enforced
nor
even
which
racial
restrictions
are
bad
at
which
to
be
ignored.
we
are
dealing
with
a
racial
restriction
made
some
years
ago,
half
a
century
ago,
and
the
question
is,
what
effect,
if
any,
can
be
given
to
it
now,
half
a
century
later,
in
light
of
the
constitutional
rule
which
has
become
clearer
in
that
span
of
time
but
importantly
also
we
are
dealing
with
the
provision
in
the
will
that
affects
not
any
sort
of
property
but
public
property,
a
public
facility
of
some
substance
here
in
the
city
of
macon.
and
in
that
sense
we
are
concerned
with
the
question
whether
a
public
facility
shall
be
closed
because
the
rule
of
non-discrimination
has
been
held
to
apply
to
it
as
this
court
held
two
terms
ago.
we
are
not
saying
simply
that
state
courts
can
never
enforce
a
restrictive
covenant
or
restrictive
provision
in
the
will.
we
are
saying
rather
that
a
provision
which
has
been
held
unenforceable.
no
question
about
that
at
this
point.
this
is
not
shelly
and
kraemer.
the
court
has
held
that
this
restrictive
covenant
with
respect
to
this
park
cannot
be
enforced.
so
the
question
is
rather
whether
indirect
effect
can
be
given
to
that
provision
by
decreeing
a
reversion,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
withdraw
a
public
facility
from
the
municipality
which
otherwise
enjoyed
it
and
from
all
the
people
in
it,
and
to
do
so
with
the
inevitable
impact
that
effect
of
discouraging
those
who
in
similar
circumstances
would
sue
to
gain
entry
as
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
when
we
are
dealing
with
this
sought
public
facility.
we
might
rest
on
the
proposition
that
when
this
factors
coincide,
the
state
court
cannot
effectuate
a
racial
covenant
by
decreeing
a
reversion
even
if
the
testator
had
provided
specifically
that
that
should
be
the
result
in
the
event
that
segregation
were
no
longer
possible
in
this
public
facility.
it
seems
to
us
however
that
this
case
is
a
good
deal
easier
because
here
clearly
the
state
court
had
alternatives.
we
are
not
faced
with
senator
bacon's
clear
intent
that
in
these
circumstances
there
shall
be
a
reversion.
nor
are
we
faced
with
a
state
law
that
does
not
provide
for
some
accommodation
when
the
exact
intention
of
the
testator
is
impossible.
we're
not
faced
with
one
of
those
few
states
where
cy
pres
is
not
the
law.
here
we
have
a
georgia
law
which
on
its
face
seems
to
permit
carrying
out
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
testator
and
varying
some
of
his
incidental
provisions
when
they
become
impossible
of
performance
as
here
the
racial
limitation
has
become
impossible
at
the
foremost.
the
case
is
easy
both
because
it
seems
obvious
that
the
georgia
courts
had
options
and
because
having
options
and
having
seemed
to
strain,
the
injury
is
all
the
greater
to
those
who
--
because
of
whose
threatened
presence
in
the
park,
the
park
is
closed.
whenever
the
stage
is
seen
to
strain
on
the
face
of
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
rule
of
desegregation
from
going
into
effect,
obviously
the
injury
to
those
excluded
is
all
the
greater
and
the
discouragement
in
like
circumstances
is
clear.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
think
there
were
two
answers
mr.
chief
justice.
the
ones
mr.
nabrit
gave
which
is
that
in
that
circumstance
there
was
no
way
of
approximating
the
purpose
of
the
testator
in
providing
funds
for
an
airport.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
that
circumstance
cy
pres
would
not
seem
to
offer
an
obvious
alternative
but
more
importantly
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
court
there
it
seems
to
me
there'll
be
no
federal
constitutional
question
there
because
there
is
no
denial
of
equal
protection
in
those
circumstances.
here
we're
dealing
not
merely
with
withdrawal
from
the
public
of
a
public
facility
which
injures
everybody.
we
are
dealing
with
a
withdrawal
of
a
public
facility
on
account
of
race
which
in
both
concrete
and
other
ways
injures
a
particular
class
of
citizens.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
when
it
is
simply
declared
at
the
beginning
that
the
trust
has
failed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
there
i
think
it's
only
in
terms
of
the
injury,
mr.
justice
black,
but
also
in
terms
of
the
options
available
to
the
estate
after
all,
constitutional
law
is
some
measure
a
question
of
possibilities
and
alternatives
when
the
alternatives
are
evenly
balanced,
it
may
be
that
the
constitution
views
the
act
as
neutral.
when
withdrawing
a
public
facility
after
half
a
century
is
done
for
the
sole
purpose
of
avoiding
a
mixing
of
the
races
in
that
public
area.
it
seems
all
the
more
a
reflection
of
an
official
policy
against
desegregation
and
that
is
constitutionally
relevant.
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
in
the
end
when
we
talk
about
the
georgia
court
having
preferred
one
option
to
another,
we
don't
of
course
impugn
the
individual
judges
to
judge
the
courts
involved.
the
case
would
be
perfectly
clear,
i
suggest
if
the
georgia
courts
had
been
applying
a
federal,
a
state
statute
which
provide
it
in
these
terms
whenever
a
racial
restriction
is
included
in
the
will
which
establishes
a
public
facility
notwithstanding
any
indication
as
to
the
testator's
intent
as
to
what
should
happen
when
that
racial
restriction
that
can
no
longer
be
enforced,
there
shall
be
a
reversion.
that
would
be
the
clearest
indication
of
the
state's
singling
out
this
condition
as
critical
as
distinguished
from
all
the
other
circumstances
where
cy
pres
would
be
applied.
that
is
really
this
case.
for
these
reasons
we
suggest
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
relevant
that
this

is

a

and

it

how

nor
is

about
which

nor
even
which
racial

are

which
to

we
