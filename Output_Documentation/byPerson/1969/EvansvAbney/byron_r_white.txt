mr.

would
it
have
been
illegal
for
him
to,
for
the
testator
to
have
left
the
park
for
joint
use
of
whites
and
negroes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
trust
law
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
there
a
law
against
whites
and
negroes
using
public
parks
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
city
is
never
treated
this
property
as
public
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
treated
as
public
property
of
dealing
with
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they've
been
in
charged
of
the
improvements
placed
on
this

haven't
they?
justice

mr.
jones,
let
us
assume
that
the
testator
leaves
a
sum
of
money
to
build
a
hospital
to
serve
exclusively
tubercular
patients.
and
as
this
time
goes
on
the
other
treatment
for
tuberculosis
and
the
patients
run
out.
i
suppose,
their
scores
of
tuberculosis
hospital
around
the
country
that
had
been
cy
pres
in
the
serving
other
purposes.
eventhough
the
testators
have
clearly
indicated
that
they
wanted
the
hospitals
limited
to
protrude
tubercular
patients
and
now
what
was
the
calculus
who
entered
into
the
georgia
supreme
courts
decision
here
that
no
cy
pres?
clearly
it's
just
like
in
a
tubercular
case
specified
that
the
park
was
to
be
limited
to
whites
but
that's
only
the
beginning
of
the
question
of
the
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
a
lot
of
wills
and
gives
on
tuberculosis
--
to
tuberculosis
hospitals.
it
is
said
sole
purpose
is
that
so
and
so
made
them
cy
pres.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
go
ahead
that
is
that
the
sole
purpose
and
therefore
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
but
you
say
the
cy
pres
doctrine
in
georgia
has
never
been
applied
to
cy
pres
into
a
different
use
in
a
situation
where
the
testators
said,
its
the
sole
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
sole
use.
now
that's
the
end
of
the
–
is
that
the
end
of
the
argument
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
go
ahead.
what
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
meant
this
to
ask
to
what
would
senator
bacon
have
done,
if
he
had
known
that
a
restricted
park
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
--
i
just
wonder
if
that's
the
approach
they
took
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
they
say
what
his
intention
was
it
if
they
didn't
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
question
are
they
answering?
what
would
he
have
done
if
he
had
known
that
a
restricted
part
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
talking
about
his
intention,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
cy
pres
is
i
would
suggested
in
georgia
the
cy
pres
is
applied
all
the
time
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
a
trust
because
as
if
you
suddenly
find
a
trust
serving
a
different
purpose
then
it
was,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
anytime
it's
suggested
the
trust
serve
a
different
purpose
that
it
did
that
the
suggestion
is
refuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
he
say
in
this
argument
that
the
certainly
its
purpose
was
to
have
a
park
for
whites
and
you
can
still
have
a
park
for
white.
and
that
the
reversion
defeats
the
purpose
to
have
a
park
for
white?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
purpose
to
have
a
park
for
the
white,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
are
used
at
the
answer
that
he
was
also
however
didn't
want
a
park
for
negro
and
whites
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
suppose
what
have
happen
or
what
would
be
the
law
if
the
city
had
simply
opened
the
park
to
white
person
or
to
the
negros
and
why
is
it
like?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
guess?
and
then
the
--
then
the
heirs
of
senator
bacon's
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
state
is
entitled
to
the
use
its
courts
to
enforce
a
private
discriminatory
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
refer
to
the
contrary
to
the
desires
of
those
presently
in
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
have
been
done
in
the
case
i
closed?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
city
hadn't
resigned
and
they
had
merely
open
the
park
to
whites
and
blacks
alike,
and
if
then
the
state
could
not
have
been
forced
with
private
restriction
in
its
course.
should
this
case
be
any
different
its
because
the
