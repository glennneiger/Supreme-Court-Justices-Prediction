mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
it
is
a
sequel
to
evans
versus
newton
decided
here
in
january
1966.
the
issue
then
as
well
as
the
georgia
courts
could
substitute
private
trustees
for
the
city
of
macon
in
order
to
permit
a
municipal
park
given
to
the
city
in
a
will
probated
in
1914
to
continue
to
be
operated
only
for
white
people
as
the
testator
directed.
that
part
of
the
controversy
was
settled
by
this
court's
decision
which
is
now
the
law
of
the
case,
that
the
park
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibition
of
racial
discrimination.
the
issue
now
is
different,
i
think
radically
different.
it
is
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
can
practically
--
can
be
practically
frustrated
and
subverted
by
the
holding
now
here,
the
holding
of
the
georgia
courts
that
a
municipal
park
is
forfeited
and
reverts
to
the
heirs
of
the
long
dead
testator
merely
because
the
constitution
in
this
court's
decision
requires
that
the
city
admit
negroes
to
the
park
along
with
whites.
the
petitioners
are
negro
citizens
of
macon
who
argue
that
baconsfield
park
must
be
operated
as
a
public
park
without
racial
discrimination
and
we
contend
for
several
reasons
that
the
georgia
court's
ruling,
that
the
public
must
forfeit
this
park
to
the
testator's
estate
violates
the
federal
constitution,
specifically,
the
supremacy
clause
of
article
six
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
factual
record
in
this
case
is
also
radically
different
in
that
it
is
much
more
complete
than
the
record
in
evans
against
newton.
let
me
briefly
describe
the
background
of
the
case.
augustus
octavius
bacon
died
in
1914.
he
had
been
elected
to
four
terms
in
the
united
states
senate
and
he
was
also
a
distinguished
lawyer
who,
it
is
relevant
to,
of
note,
had
published
a
digest
of
the
opinions
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
in
1872.
he
wrote
his
32-page
will
in
his
own
hand
in
1911
and
that
will
left
bacon's
farm
and
trust
to
his
wife
and
surviving
daughter
during
their
lives,
and
after
their
deaths,
in
trust
for
and
i
quote
“the
sole
perpetual
and
unending
use,
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
the
white
women,
white
girls,
white
boys
and
white
children
of
the
city
of
macon.
the
will
made
no
provision
for
any
reversion
of
the
property
and
it
was
not
a
conditional
gift.
rather
bacon
conveyed
to
the
city
and
again
i
quote,
“all
right,
title
and
interest
in
and
to
said
property
here
and
before
described
and
bounded
both
legal
and
equitable,
including
all
remainders
and
reversions
in
every
estate
in
the
same
of
whatsoever
kind.”
bacon's
will
provide
that
the
land
should
be
forever
used
and
enjoyed
as
a
park
and
pleasure
ground
and
he
said
that
under
no
circumstances
should
it
be
sold
or
alienated
or
dedicated
to
any
other
use.
the
will
mentioned
that
he
wanted
the
park
to
be
a
memorial
for
his
two
dead
sons
that
he
had
no
descendants
baring
the
name
bacon
and
he
stipulated
that
the
park
should
forever
be
known
as
baconsfield.
now
as
my
adversary
has
emphasized,
bacon
quite
plainly
stated
that
he
did
not
want
negroes
to
use
this
park,
and
this
was
not
he
said
because
of
any
unkindness
or
want
of
consideration
for
negroes
but
because
he
thought
that
the
two
races
should
be
separate
in
social
relations
and
should
not
occupy
the
same
recreation
grounds.
so
we
cheerfully
concede
that
it
violates
bacon's
solemn
intent
for
negroes
to
use
this
park
but
we
also
want
it
to
be
clear
that
it
equally
violates
bacon's
intent
to
destroy
the
park
and
revert
it
to
his
heirs
but
he
never
contemplated
this
situation.
his
will
contains
nothing
to
indicate
that
bacon
prefer
that
his
park
be
destroyed
and
revert
to
his
heirs
rather
than
to
have
negroes
use
it.
his
intent
on
this
question
cannot
be
known,
it's
unknowable
and
that's
conceded
in
the
opinion
below
in
the
brief
and
opposition
to
certiorari.
now
the
city
acquired
baconsfield
actually
in
1920,
but
buying
the
heir's
interest
during
the
life
of
bacon's
surviving
daughter
for
an
annuity
for
$1,665.00
yearly.
the
city
paid
that
to
the
heirs
for
25
years
and
it
ultimately
cost
the
city
over
$41,000.00.
incidentally
that
1920
deed
indicates
that
the
total
land
involved
was
a
117.7
acres
at
1917,
1920.
since
1920
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right,
bacon's
surviving
daughter
didn't
die
until
1944.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
so
the
city
would
not
have
had
this
park
until
1944
if
bacon's
will
had
been
followed
literally
but
they
got
the
park
in
1920
and
since
then,
it
has
been
of
the
--
that's
in
those
in
the
fifty
years
since
then
there
has
been
a
vast
and
direct
investment
of
public
funds.
of
course
the
property
has
been
tax-exempt
for
this
nearly
fifty
years
and
that
represents
a
large
subsidy
but
beyond
this,
the
basic
development
and
landscaping
of
this
park
was
done
by
the
wpa
the
works
progress
administration
and
agency
of
the
united
states.
the
city
parks
superintendent
testified
that
until
the
time
he
went
out
there
with
the
wpa
work
as
mere
set
him
out
he
said.
“baconsfield
was
a
wilderness
to
use
his
word,
this
was
around
1935.”
it
was
just
a
wilderness
and
the
wpa
met
under
his
supervision
work
for
a
year,
or
more
than
a
year,
cutting
down
the
underbrush,
laying
out
the
pass,
digging
the
ponds,
building
benches
and
transforming
baconsfield
from
a
wilderness
into
a
usable
park.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
not
--
i
have
no
knowledge
as
to
what
the
united
states
policy
is
on
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
are
specific
statutory
rights
that
the
united
states
might
have
which
i'm
going
to
come
to
particularly
with
regard
to
the
clubhouse
building
that
the
wpa
built,
a
major
building
on
the
property
and
in
that
case
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
the
treasurer
of
the
city
made
specific
assurances
to
the
united
states
that
this
property
would
not
be
released
by
the
city
during
its
useful
life
of
the
improvements
and
further,
amazingly,
that
there
would
be
no
discrimination
in
this
park
property
of
the
city,
the
city
solemnly
swore
that
this
property
was
for
the
public
at
large
in
1939.
the
conception
of
the
public
didn't
include
negroes
apparently.
i
didn't
mean
to
evade
your
question
about
the
land
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
there
might
be
one.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
--
if
there's
a
--
i
don't
know
that
--
my
client's
contribution
has
been
the
contribution
of
tax
payers
generally
to
this
park,
city
taxpayers
and
federal
taxpayers
and
in
all
these
capacities
they
have
an
investment
in
this
park.
the
roads
through
the
park
were
built
by
the
city,
there's
a
swimming
pool
out
there
that
cost
the
city
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
there's
a
bath
house
that
cost
$40,000.00
in
1948,
$17,000.00
worth
of
improvements
added
to
that
in
subsequent
years.
all
these
was
taxpayers
money
invested
in
this
property
and
all
of
it's
been
reverted
by
the
judgment
below
stands.
the
--
when
we
inspected
this
clubhouse
building
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
with
superior
court's
permission,
my
colleague,
william
alexander
found
the
wpa
plaque,
all
this
wpa
buildings
have
a
plaque,
you
know.
my
colleague
found
this
wpa
plaque
with
only
with
some
difficulty
on
that
women's
clubhouse
because
someone
had
hung
a
mirror
over
it
during
a
redecoration
so
another
plaque
coding
the
racial
limitation
in
bacon's
will
was
rather
prominently
displayed.
i
think
there's
no
little
irony
in
that
considering
the
solemn
assurances
of
none
discrimination
that
the
city
official
sign.
all
the
maintenance
in
this
park
until
1964
was
done
by
the
city
park
department.
they
treated
this
just
like
any
other
park
and
the
man
who
had
been
superintendent
for
--
since
1915
testified.
he
treated
baconsfield
like
all
the
rest
of
his
parks.
the
only
exception
was
that
some
of
the
thrust
income
was
used
to
add,
to
help
beautify
baconsfield
in
addition
to
city
funds.
the
thrust
property
i
quickly
want
to
mention
that's
been
reverted
also
includes
a
shopping
center
across
this
street
from
this
park
and
furnishes
$5.00
or
$7,000.00
a
year
annually.
this
was
income
for
the
thrust,
it
also
includes
a
$131,000.00
or
more
in
cash
or
bonds
in
the
bank
that
they
got
for
the
highway
condemned
further
the
property
but
this
case
involves
--
this
case
involves
more
than
who
gets
this
money
when
it's
the
people
they
ask.
it
involves
principle.
it
involves
whether
or
not
the
law
is
going
to
--
they
are
going
to
perpetuate
this
kind
or
racism.
when
negroes
began
using
baconsfield
in
1963
the
city
concluded
that
it
could
not
exclude
them
from
the
park
and
that
was
obviously
correct
since
this
court
had
ruled
as
early
as
1955,
park
segregation
was
unconstitutional
and
it
ruled
in
1957
that
a
municipal
trust
couldn't
be
discriminatory
in
the
girard
college
case,
pennsylvania
against
the
board
of
city
trust
and
the
city's
answer
in
this
case
in
the
superior
court
stating
that
they
couldn't
discriminate
was
filed.
it
happens
the
day
that
this
district
court
decided
right
against
georgia
where
the
court
invalidated
savannah's
effort
that
keeps
negroes
out
of
the
city
park.
when
the
georgia
courts
approve
the
city's
resignation
to
--
to
attempt
to
continue
the
park
as
an
all-white
facility,
this
court
reversed.
so
now
in
response,
the
georgia
courts
have
ruled
that
the
trust
failed
and
accordingly
returned
to
our
arguments.
we
are
given
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
trust
has
failed
and
i'm
about
to
argue
why
i
think
that
decision
of
georgia
law
violates
the
command
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
say
that
the
trust
has
failed
and
that
accordingly
the
land
and
the
other
assets
revert
to
the
donor's
estate
as
a
resulting
trust
and
that
therefore
it's
to
be
distributed
as
part
of
his
estate
in
accordance
with
the
will
provision
of
the
residual
estate.
now
i
think
each
of
the
four
arguments
we
make
is
sufficient
to
justify
a
reversal.
let
me
identify
the
four
arguments
each
in
a
sense
or
two
before
beginning
to
develop
the
first
one.
the
first
point
is,
that
the
decision
below
which
forfeits
public
property
applies
a
sanction
against
a
federal
interest
and
violates
doctrines
of
national
supremacy
running
all
the
way
back
to
mcculloch
against
maryland.
this
forfeiture
has
affected
in
a
way
it
happens
which
also
discourages
desegregation
and
is
done
without
any
justification.
the
second
point
we
will
make
is
that,
since
nothing
has
happened
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
the
reason
--
that
i
would
argue
if
i
had
to
face
that
more
difficult
question
that
our
legal
system,
that
our
courts
can't
be
used
by
dead
men
to
perpetuate
their
bigotry
in
the
law,
and
that
racism
has
to
die
with
the
bigot
and
that
the
legal
system
can't
give
it
perpetuity.
so
i
don't
believe,
if
i
had
the
case
here,
that
i
would
concede
or
i
believe
that
i
would
argue,
that
racist
trust
can't
be
enforced
but
i
don't
think
that
case
is
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
way
we
analyze
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
second
argument
i
was
going
to
summarize,
is
that
that
hasn't
quite
happened
here.
we
don't
think
the
uses,
that
the
purpose
of
the
trust
has
become
illegal
in
our
case.
the
park
is
still
there
for
the
white
women
and
children,
the
boys
of
macon
to
play
in.
nothing
has
happened
which
keeps
them
the
beneficiaries
from
getting
the
benefit
of
the
trust.
now
something
has
happened
which
keeps
them
from
getting
the
sole
use
and
bacon
wanted
them
to
have
the
sole
use
to
be
sure
but
he
didn't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
i
think
not.
the
purpose
of
providing
a
park
for
the
white
women
and
children
can
still
be
fulfilled.
they
cannot
have
sole
use
of
it.
negroes
have
to
be
admitted
too
but
the
point
is,
that
negro
use
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
at
least
where
you
have
a
vast
park
land,
negro
use
doesn't
diminish
the
white
use.
it's
not
a
case
like,
as
for
example
where
you
have
a
trust
fund
and
if
it
went
to
one
group,
it
had
to
be
divided
with
another
group,
the
only
amount
left
for
the
first
group
would
be
diminished.
that
kind
of
trust
was
the
--
if
a
trust
for
whites
only
had
been
declared,
scholarship
funds
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
when
evans
against
newton,
it
would
be
plain
that
the
whites
would
have
less
if
they
had
to
share
it
with
the
blacks
but
that's
not
true
in
a
public
park.
there's
nothing
that's
happened.
the
white
children
of
macon
today
are
in
fact
using
baconsfield
park
because
it
was
a
state
as
in
effect
and
the
park
is
there
open
to
public
today.
so
i
think
it's
not
like
an
airport
where
the
runways
are
too
short
for
the
planes.
the
park
is
big
enough
for
everybody
now.
the
third
argument
and
i
--
let
me
make
an
overall
point.
i
think
there
is
nothing
special
about
trust
law
that
exempts
it
from
the
command
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
not
as
the
fact
that
the
law
involved
is
common
law
and
that
statute
law
place
it
outside
the
reach
of
the
constitution.
we
think
this
point
is
amply
established
by
the
decision
last
termed
in
presbyterian
church
against
the
hall
church
where
the
court
unanimously
concluded
that
georgia
courts
deciding
a
common
law
trust
law
must
do
so
in
conformity
with
the
first
amendment
guarantees
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
innumerous
cases
and
all
--
in
different
context
make
the
point
of
our
common
law.
judge
may
law
being
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
new
york
times
against
sullivan
makes
that
point
in
very
plain
language.
the
state's
libel
law
has
to
march
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
edwards
against
south
carolina
involving
a
common
law
crime
illustrates
the
same
idea
in
another
context.
of
course
trust
law
is
normally
a
matter
for
state
determination.
of
course
georgia
has
the
last
word
in
defining
its
common
law
trust
as
a
general
matter
but
that
only
opens
the
question
we
submit
of
whether
the
law
is
settled
by
georgia
conforms
to
the
command
of
the
constitution
as
to
that
question
that
i
address
myself
with
these
four
arguments.
our
first
argument
as
i
indicated
is
rooted
in
the
fundamental
proposition
announced
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
in
1890.
the
states
have
no
power
to
take
action
hostile
to
a
national
interest
not
even
as
then
when
using
the
basic
taxing
problem
may
they
penalize
a
federal
interest.
and
we
think
the
decision
below
violates
the
command
of
federal
supremacy,
not
because
this
court's
mandate
has
been
directly
flouted,
but
rather
because
the
state
has
decreed
that
valuable
city
property
must
be
forfeited
entirely
on
the
ground
that
the
constitution
and
the
decision
of
this
court
require
that
the
city
admit
negroes
to
baconsfield.
we
complain
not
that
there
will
still
be
segregation.
we
can't
know
how
the
heirs
will
use
the
land.
we
complain
about
the
fact
of
the
forfeiture
itself
and
this
valuable
facility
which
is
valuable
to
the
taxpayers
in
part
because
of
its
--
of
the
original
value
and
in
part
because
the
taxpayers
have
added
to
it
in
multiple
ways,
is
being
taken
away
solely
to
prevent
negroes
from
using
this
park.
this
is
a
direct
drastic
sanction
against
compliance
with
what
the
constitution
compelled
and
this
court's
decision
compel.
now
here
the
sanction
has
the
added
characteristic
and
the
added
impact
of
discouraging
this
desegregation
just
as
in
the
prince
edward
county
school
closing
case.
the
case
--
the
closing
of
the
park
conveys
to
negroes
unmistakably
the
plain
message
that
if
you
will
search
your
fourteenth
amendment
rights
it
won't
get
you
anything.
all
you'll
do
is
destroy
the
parks
for
everyone
and
that
obviously
discourages
compliance
with
the
constitution.
that
might
be
our
--
the
only
possible
justification
that
might
be
offered
for
such
a
forfeiture
would
be
a
clear
direction
by
attesting
that
bacon
made
no
such
choice.
the
georgia
courts
made
this
choice.
our
respondents
argue
that
the
trust
fails
automatically
on
january
17,
1966,
the
day
the
moment
this
court
announced
its
decision.
that's
a
groundless
and
artificial
argument.
they
never
adopted
it
until
a
month
--
more
than
a
month
later.
the
minutes
of
their
board
meeting
at
page
346
of
the
appendix
show
that
in
the
board
of
marriages
of
baconsfield
discussing
this
court's
decision
didn't
conclude
that
it
reverted.
it
was
only
after
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
march
that
reverted,
the
disposition
became
announced
for
many
of
them
the
only
sound
jurisprudential
view
is
that
the
georgia
law
comes
from
human
decisions
and
this
is
the
premise
on
which
such
basic
law
is
uriah
against
tompkins
stands.
i
have
talked
a
little
bit
about
our
second
argument,
the
fact
that
nothing's
happened
which
prevents
white
women
and
children
from
using
the
park
and
the
point
we
make
in
our
brief
is
that
the
only
manner
in
which
the
state
court
could
have
logically
reached
its
conclusion
that
the
uses
of
the
trust
have
failed
is
by
a
legal
premise,
an
implicit
legal
premise,
that
negro
use
as
a
matter
of
law
diminishes
the
white
use
because
negroes
are
per
se
offensive
or
obnoxious.
and
such
a
ground
we
say,
imposes
a
badge
of
inferiority
on
blacks
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits.
we
do
not
contend
that
this
was
consciously
the
theory
adopted.
it
never
said
anything
like
that.
what
we
contend
is
that's
the
only
logical
foundation
on
which
the
conclusion
can
rest.
the
case
might
be
more
difficult
if
the
court
below
had
not
have
had
no
alternative
under
its
law
but
it
play
--
but
there
were
no
georgia
decisions.
no
one
has
come
up
with
any
settled
georgia
case
law
that
forced
this
resolve.
the
side
place
statute
offer
plain
alternative
and
the
only
case
that
has
ever
been
cited,
it
is
not
cited,
the
respondents
don't
cite
it
here
but
they
didn't
--
in
the
court
below.
this
is
adams
against
bass
case,
but
in
1855
georgia
refused
to
apply
cy
pres
to
resettle
slaves
in
certain
states
on
the
grounds
of
that
particular
states
would
not
receive
them
and
that's
the
only
case
they've
found.
it
is
before
the
civil
war
amendments
and
in
any
event
it
had
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
georgia
law
which
made
it
illegal
to
free
a
slave.
our
third
argument
which
i
will
not
have
time
to
argue
because
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
but
i
will
state
it.
it
follows
the
reasoning
in
mr.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
evidence
against
newton,
we
add
to
that
only
that
this
georgia
law
in
1905
which
provided
for
racially
oriented
parks
it
facilitated
testators
making
brands
of
this
kind
but
beyond
that
we
think
that
the
law
plainly
encouraged
racial
discrimination,
and
it
--
as
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
1966
stated,
we
think
incurably
taints
the
racial
condition
in
the
trust
and
we
think
that
tainted
provision
should
not
be
given
any
effect,
should
not
be
even
be
given
effect
in
effecting
the
reverter.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
it's
still,
as
to
judges
the
white
women
and
children
and
negro
women
and
children
i
think
there
is
plainly
no
authorization
for
it
so
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
well
i
am
talking
about
69504
now.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
am
--
i
have
not
found
a
law
making
it
a
crime,
statewide.
there
were
certainly
local
laws
of
that
kind.
that
was
one
in
the
holmes
case,
holmes
against
--i
know
of
none
applying
to,
to
make
it
in
1914
,1912.
but
well
let
me
amend
that.
section
69505
which
is
the
companion
to
69504
made
it
the
obligation
of
the
city
to
use
its
police
powers
to
enforce
the
racial
condition
in
bacon's
trust.
so
as
soon
as
the
city
accepted
bacon's
trust,
bacon's
command
the
racism
did
become
the
law
of
macon
and
for
that
reason
additionally
we
urge
that
the
case
ought
to
be
treated
like
an
invalid
city
code.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
claiborne
yesterday
post
the
question
that
i
suggest
must
be
confronted.
isn't
it
really
true
as
he
said
that
the
state
statute
which
provide
and
in
terms
of
what
has
actually
been
done
in
this
case
would
be
pretty
obviously
on
constitution?
that
hypothetical
law
would
say
something
like
this
that
even
if
a
testator
expresses
no
intent
on
the
issue
of
reversion.
and
even
if
there
were
no
difficulties
in
administering
apart
nonracially
and
even
if
the
name
beneficiaries
could
still
get
benefit
and
there
benefit
was
not
diminish.
for
the
charitable
trust
to
the
way
racial
limitation
fails
if
federal
law
prevents
that
racial
limitation
from
being
imposed.
as
i
hear
urge
yesterday,
i
don't
think
if
really
can
make
a
difference
that
the
rule
have
just
stated
is
not
georgia's
common
law
and
not
a
statute
law
rule.
the
essence
of
the
case
i
think
is
simply
that
georgia
acting
through
its
courts
has
chosen
to
give
special
emphasis
to
the
racial
rule
and
to
destroy
a
public
park
and
give
it
away
or
rather
to
have
it
integrated.
by
this
decision
the
state
is
chosen
to
regard
the
racial
rule
as
the
essential
and
to
reject
the
idea
that
a
perpetual
park
is
the
purpose.
a
park
for
the
benefit
of
white
people
is
not
becoming
possible
or
illegal
and
this
is
clear
i
think,
if
one
accepts
the
simple
proposition
the
park
still
benefits
white
people
even
if
negroes
are
admitted
to
the
park
at
the
same
time.
and
today,
if
maybe
supposed
that
the
alexander
school
number
three,
a
public
school
right
across
the
street
from
the
park
is
using
that
playground
then
white
-
negro
children
at
that
school
are
playing
in
the
park
today.
the
judgment
stands
this
will
be
destroyed.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
yesterday,
if
our
position
would
be
different.
if
the
testator
provided
for
a
racial
reverted
and
i
said,
no.
i
think,
i
should
add
to
my
answer
that
the
definitive
article
on
this
subject
was
written
by
professor
hilarious
clark
in
the
lru
in
1957.
in
that
article
i
think,
contains
all
the
arguments
that
charitable
trust
are
really
totally
involved
in
state
action.
but
the
case
relied
on
by
the
heirs,
this
north
carolina
barringer
case.
i
think,
it
shows
the
difference
between
that
kind
of
case,
on
the
present
one.
in
that
case
which
is
discussed
at
pages
47
and
48
of
our
brief,
the
north
carolina
court
had
two
deeds
before
it.
and
one
deed
had
an
expressed
racial
reverted
and
the
court
gave
effect
to
it.
and
we
think
that
was
wrong
not
for
the
reasons
i
have
expressed
yesterday.
but
the
other
deed
in
that
case
didn't
have
it
good
--
it
had
a
racial
limitation
but
didn't
provide
a
condition
and
the
north
carolina
court
said,
it
wouldn't
step
in
and
make
the
racial
choice.
that's
what
--
and
it
said
second
situation
that
something
comfortable
to
that
second
deed
in
the
north
carolina
case
that
we
have
here.
it's
the
georgia
court
that
stepped
in
and
made
the
choice
that
today
no
park
is
to
be
preferred
to
an
integrated
park
and
bacon
really
didn't
make
that
choice.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
case
is
at
the
citation
of
the
bottom
of
page
47
of
our
brief.
it's
called
charlotte
park
and
recreation
commission
against
maryland,
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
they
don't
--
i
don't
read
them
to
interpret
bacon's
will
to
me
that
this
will
do
me
anything
other
than
what
we
contend.
that
he
wanted
a
park,
that
they
wanted
it
for
white
people
and
they
didn't
want
negroes
in
it,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
park.
there
is
no
--
their
decision
was
that
when
negroes
had
to
be
admitted
to
the
park
somehow
it
became
impossible
to
have
a
park,
did
become
impossible
to
have
an
all
white
park.
i
make
to
be
sure
there
is
a
kind
of
equality
created
by
destroying
the
park
for
everyone
since
before
only
negroes
were
excluded
and
now
everyone
is
excluded.
but
that
kind
of
superficial
equality
doesn't
for
me
fulfill
the
states
obligation
to
afford
negroes.
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
but
we
object
to
it
the
forfeiture
itself.
and
the
message
of
that
kind
of
forfeiture
decreed
by
state
law
it
seems
to
me
is
pretty
plain.
says
something
like
this
to
negroes,
it
says
that
the
law
honor
us
a
will
leaving
land
to
a
city
for
whites
only.
more
than
it
honors
your
right
to
come
on
city
property
and
says
that
your
presence
eventhough
lawful,
so
it
changes
the
character
of
a
public
park
that
the
law
prefers
no
park
to
a
park
open
to
you.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
i
have.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
view
is
that
there
were
no
georgia
cases
which
clearly
determined
this
that
the
statute
mr.
--
these
two
statutes
mr.
jones
has
referred
to
set
out
on
page
55
of
our
brief.
our
what
the
georgia
court
was
using
and
if
those
statutes
only
have
any
meaning
when
the
testators
intend
can't
be
follow.
that's
the
only
time
that
you
use
this
statutes
it
is
the
first
one,
when
a
valid
charitable
be
quest
is
incapable
for
some
reason
of
execution
in
the
exact
manner
provided
by
the
testator,
donor
or
founder.
the
court
of
equity
will
carried
into
effect
in
such
a
way
as
will
as
nearly
as
possible
effectuate
is
intention.
obviously,
bacon's
will
couldn't
be
carried
out
exactly
as
he
intended
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
answer
is
the
same
i
think,
we
don't
contend
that
we've
no
found
any
case
like
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
think
that
wherever
city
makes
a
present
political
judgment,
prudential
judgment
that
it
wants
to
abandon
a
public
facility
that
maybe
done.
however,
i
think
that
kind
of
decision
is
subject
to
examination
by
a
proper
court
as
to
whether
or
not
to
substitute
is
to
whether
they
are
really
doing
this
as
a
method
affording
desegregation,
for
example.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
the
qualification
for
practical
purposes
the
qualification
i
made
is
the
important
thing
because
here
the
purpose
is
admitted
there
is
no
doubt
at
all.
but
the
purpose
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
find
that
the
discriminatory
motive
in
this
case
from
the
start
to
the
finish
really
from
the
1905
statute
which
would
started
all
off,
from
the
action
of
the
georgia
courts
in
running
heir
as
a
white
only
park
all
those
years
using
the
taxpayers
money,
in
the
georgia
perhaps
city
running
at
all
issues
using
the
taxpayers
money.
from
the
action
of
the
georgia
courts
in
trying
to
evade
the
admission
of
negroes
by
removing
the
city's
trustee
and
now
in
the
present
decision
to
close
the
park
rather
than
that
they
have
negroes
in
it.
so,
i
think
the
state
action
in
that
case
start
to
finish.
thank
you
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
it
is
a
sequel
to
evans
versus
newton
decided
here
in
january
1966.
the
issue
then
as
well
as
the
georgia
courts
could
substitute
private
trustees
for
the
city
of
macon
in
order
to
permit
a
municipal
park
given
to
the
city
in
a
will
probated
in
1914
to
continue
to
be
operated
only
for
white
people
as
the
testator
directed.
that
part
of
the
controversy
was
settled
by
this
court's
decision
which
is
now
the
law
of
the
case,
that
the
park
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibition
of
racial
discrimination.
the
issue
now
is
different,
i
think
radically
different.
it
is
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
can
practically
--
can
be
practically
frustrated
and
subverted
by
the
holding
now
here,
the
holding
of
the
georgia
courts
that
a
municipal
park
is
forfeited
and
reverts
to
the
heirs
of
the
long
dead
testator
merely
because
the
constitution
in
this
court's
decision
requires
that
the
city
admit
negroes
to
the
park
along
with
whites.
the
petitioners
are
negro
citizens
of
macon
who
argue
that
baconsfield
park
must
be
operated
as
a
public
park
without
racial
discrimination
and
we
contend
for
several
reasons
that
the
georgia
court's
ruling,
that
the
public
must
forfeit
this
park
to
the
testator's
estate
violates
the
federal
constitution,
specifically,
the
supremacy
clause
of
article
six
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
factual
record
in
this
case
is
also
radically
different
in
that
it
is
much
more
complete
than
the
record
in
evans
against
newton.
let
me
briefly
describe
the
background
of
the
case.
augustus
octavius
bacon
died
in
1914.
he
had
been
elected
to
four
terms
in
the
united
states
senate
and
he
was
also
a
distinguished
lawyer
who,
it
is
relevant
to,
of
note,
had
published
a
digest
of
the
opinions
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
in
1872.
he
wrote
his
32-page
will
in
his
own
hand
in
1911
and
that
will
left
bacon's
farm
and
trust
to
his
wife
and
surviving
daughter
during
their
lives,
and
after
their
deaths,
in
trust
for
and
i
quote
“the
sole
perpetual
and
unending
use,
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
the
white
women,
white
girls,
white
boys
and
white
children
of
the
city
of
macon.
the
will
made
no
provision
for
any
reversion
of
the
property
and
it
was
not
a
conditional
gift.
rather
bacon
conveyed
to
the
city
and
again
i
quote,
“all
right,
title
and
interest
in
and
to
said
property
here
and
before
described
and
bounded
both
legal
and
equitable,
including
all
remainders
and
reversions
in
every
estate
in
the
same
of
whatsoever
kind.”
bacon's
will
provide
that
the
land
should
be
forever
used
and
enjoyed
as
a
park
and
pleasure
ground
and
he
said
that
under
no
circumstances
should
it
be
sold
or
alienated
or
dedicated
to
any
other
use.
the
will
mentioned
that
he
wanted
the
park
to
be
a
memorial
for
his
two
dead
sons
that
he
had
no
descendants
baring
the
name
bacon
and
he
stipulated
that
the
park
should
forever
be
known
as
baconsfield.
now
as
my
adversary
has
emphasized,
bacon
quite
plainly
stated
that
he
did
not
want
negroes
to
use
this
park,
and
this
was
not
he
said
because
of
any
unkindness
or
want
of
consideration
for
negroes
but
because
he
thought
that
the
two
races
should
be
separate
in
social
relations
and
should
not
occupy
the
same
recreation
grounds.
so
we
cheerfully
concede
that
it
violates
bacon's
solemn
intent
for
negroes
to
use
this
park
but
we
also
want
it
to
be
clear
that
it
equally
violates
bacon's
intent
to
destroy
the
park
and
revert
it
to
his
heirs
but
he
never
contemplated
this
situation.
his
will
contains
nothing
to
indicate
that
bacon
prefer
that
his
park
be
destroyed
and
revert
to
his
heirs
rather
than
to
have
negroes
use
it.
his
intent
on
this
question
cannot
be
known,
it's
unknowable
and
that's
conceded
in
the
opinion
below
in
the
brief
and
opposition
to
certiorari.
now
the
city
acquired
baconsfield
actually
in
1920,
but
buying
the
heir's
interest
during
the
life
of
bacon's
surviving
daughter
for
an
annuity
for
$1,665.00
yearly.
the
city
paid
that
to
the
heirs
for
25
years
and
it
ultimately
cost
the
city
over
$41,000.00.
incidentally
that
1920
deed
indicates
that
the
total
land
involved
was
a
117.7
acres
at
1917,
1920.
since
1920
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right,
bacon's
surviving
daughter
didn't
die
until
1944.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
so
the
city
would
not
have
had
this
park
until
1944
if
bacon's
will
had
been
followed
literally
but
they
got
the
park
in
1920
and
since
then,
it
has
been
of
the
--
that's
in
those
in
the
fifty
years
since
then
there
has
been
a
vast
and
direct
investment
of
public
funds.
of
course
the
property
has
been
tax-exempt
for
this
nearly
fifty
years
and
that
represents
a
large
subsidy
but
beyond
this,
the
basic
development
and
landscaping
of
this
park
was
done
by
the
wpa
the
works
progress
administration
and
agency
of
the
united
states.
the
city
parks
superintendent
testified
that
until
the
time
he
went
out
there
with
the
wpa
work
as
mere
set
him
out
he
said.
“baconsfield
was
a
wilderness
to
use
his
word,
this
was
around
1935.”
it
was
just
a
wilderness
and
the
wpa
met
under
his
supervision
work
for
a
year,
or
more
than
a
year,
cutting
down
the
underbrush,
laying
out
the
pass,
digging
the
ponds,
building
benches
and
transforming
baconsfield
from
a
wilderness
into
a
usable
park.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
not
--
i
have
no
knowledge
as
to
what
the
united
states
policy
is
on
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
are
specific
statutory
rights
that
the
united
states
might
have
which
i'm
going
to
come
to
particularly
with
regard
to
the
clubhouse
building
that
the
wpa
built,
a
major
building
on
the
property
and
in
that
case
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
the
treasurer
of
the
city
made
specific
assurances
to
the
united
states
that
this
property
would
not
be
released
by
the
city
during
its
useful
life
of
the
improvements
and
further,
amazingly,
that
there
would
be
no
discrimination
in
this
park
property
of
the
city,
the
city
solemnly
swore
that
this
property
was
for
the
public
at
large
in
1939.
the
conception
of
the
public
didn't
include
negroes
apparently.
i
didn't
mean
to
evade
your
question
about
the
land
but
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
there
might
be
one.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
--
if
there's
a
--
i
don't
know
that
--
my
client's
contribution
has
been
the
contribution
of
tax
payers
generally
to
this
park,
city
taxpayers
and
federal
taxpayers
and
in
all
these
capacities
they
have
an
investment
in
this
park.
the
roads
through
the
park
were
built
by
the
city,
there's
a
swimming
pool
out
there
that
cost
the
city
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
there's
a
bath
house
that
cost
$40,000.00
in
1948,
$17,000.00
worth
of
improvements
added
to
that
in
subsequent
years.
all
these
was
taxpayers
money
invested
in
this
property
and
all
of
it's
been
reverted
by
the
judgment
below
stands.
the
--
when
we
inspected
this
clubhouse
building
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
with
superior
court's
permission,
my
colleague,
william
alexander
found
the
wpa
plaque,
all
this
wpa
buildings
have
a
plaque,
you
know.
my
colleague
found
this
wpa
plaque
with
only
with
some
difficulty
on
that
women's
clubhouse
because
someone
had
hung
a
mirror
over
it
during
a
redecoration
so
another
plaque
coding
the
racial
limitation
in
bacon's
will
was
rather
prominently
displayed.
i
think
there's
no
little
irony
in
that
considering
the
solemn
assurances
of
none
discrimination
that
the
city
official
sign.
all
the
maintenance
in
this
park
until
1964
was
done
by
the
city
park
department.
they
treated
this
just
like
any
other
park
and
the
man
who
had
been
superintendent
for
--
since
1915
testified.
he
treated
baconsfield
like
all
the
rest
of
his
parks.
the
only
exception
was
that
some
of
the
thrust
income
was
used
to
add,
to
help
beautify
baconsfield
in
addition
to
city
funds.
the
thrust
property
i
quickly
want
to
mention
that's
been
reverted
also
includes
a
shopping
center
across
this
street
from
this
park
and
furnishes
$5.00
or
$7,000.00
a
year
annually.
this
was
income
for
the
thrust,
it
also
includes
a
$131,000.00
or
more
in
cash
or
bonds
in
the
bank
that
they
got
for
the
highway
condemned
further
the
property
but
this
case
involves
--
this
case
involves
more
than
who
gets
this
money
when
it's
the
people
they
ask.
it
involves
principle.
it
involves
whether
or
not
the
law
is
going
to
--
they
are
going
to
perpetuate
this
kind
or
racism.
when
negroes
began
using
baconsfield
in
1963
the
city
concluded
that
it
could
not
exclude
them
from
the
park
and
that
was
obviously
correct
since
this
court
had
ruled
as
early
as
1955,
park
segregation
was
unconstitutional
and
it
ruled
in
1957
that
a
municipal
trust
couldn't
be
discriminatory
in
the
girard
college
case,
pennsylvania
against
the
board
of
city
trust
and
the
city's
answer
in
this
case
in
the
superior
court
stating
that
they
couldn't
discriminate
was
filed.
it
happens
the
day
that
this
district
court
decided
right
against
georgia
where
the
court
invalidated
savannah's
effort
that
keeps
negroes
out
of
the
city
park.
when
the
georgia
courts
approve
the
city's
resignation
to
--
to
attempt
to
continue
the
park
as
an
all-white
facility,
this
court
reversed.
so
now
in
response,
the
georgia
courts
have
ruled
that
the
trust
failed
and
accordingly
returned
to
our
arguments.
we
are
given
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
the
trust
has
failed
and
i'm
about
to
argue
why
i
think
that
decision
of
georgia
law
violates
the
command
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
say
that
the
trust
has
failed
and
that
accordingly
the
land
and
the
other
assets
revert
to
the
donor's
estate
as
a
resulting
trust
and
that
therefore
it's
to
be
distributed
as
part
of
his
estate
in
accordance
with
the
will
provision
of
the
residual
estate.
now
i
think
each
of
the
four
arguments
we
make
is
sufficient
to
justify
a
reversal.
let
me
identify
the
four
arguments
each
in
a
sense
or
two
before
beginning
to
develop
the
first
one.
the
first
point
is,
that
the
decision
below
which
forfeits
public
property
applies
a
sanction
against
a
federal
interest
and
violates
doctrines
of
national
supremacy
running
all
the
way
back
to
mcculloch
against
maryland.
this
forfeiture
has
affected
in
a
way
it
happens
which
also
discourages
desegregation
and
is
done
without
any
justification.
the
second
point
we
will
make
is
that,
since
nothing
has
happened
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
the
reason
--
that
i
would
argue
if
i
had
to
face
that
more
difficult
question
that
our
legal
system,
that
our
courts
can't
be
used
by
dead
men
to
perpetuate
their
bigotry
in
the
law,
and
that
racism
has
to
die
with
the
bigot
and
that
the
legal
system
can't
give
it
perpetuity.
so
i
don't
believe,
if
i
had
the
case
here,
that
i
would
concede
or
i
believe
that
i
would
argue,
that
racist
trust
can't
be
enforced
but
i
don't
think
that
case
is
here.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
way
we
analyze
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
second
argument
i
was
going
to
summarize,
is
that
that
hasn't
quite
happened
here.
we
don't
think
the
uses,
that
the
purpose
of
the
trust
has
become
illegal
in
our
case.
the
park
is
still
there
for
the
white
women
and
children,
the
boys
of
macon
to
play
in.
nothing
has
happened
which
keeps
them
the
beneficiaries
from
getting
the
benefit
of
the
trust.
now
something
has
happened
which
keeps
them
from
getting
the
sole
use
and
bacon
wanted
them
to
have
the
sole
use
to
be
sure
but
he
didn't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
i
think
not.
the
purpose
of
providing
a
park
for
the
white
women
and
children
can
still
be
fulfilled.
they
cannot
have
sole
use
of
it.
negroes
have
to
be
admitted
too
but
the
point
is,
that
negro
use
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
at
least
where
you
have
a
vast
park
land,
negro
use
doesn't
diminish
the
white
use.
it's
not
a
case
like,
as
for
example
where
you
have
a
trust
fund
and
if
it
went
to
one
group,
it
had
to
be
divided
with
another
group,
the
only
amount
left
for
the
first
group
would
be
diminished.
that
kind
of
trust
was
the
--
if
a
trust
for
whites
only
had
been
declared,
scholarship
funds
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
when
evans
against
newton,
it
would
be
plain
that
the
whites
would
have
less
if
they
had
to
share
it
with
the
blacks
but
that's
not
true
in
a
public
park.
there's
nothing
that's
happened.
the
white
children
of
macon
today
are
in
fact
using
baconsfield
park
because
it
was
a
state
as
in
effect
and
the
park
is
there
open
to
public
today.
so
i
think
it's
not
like
an
airport
where
the
runways
are
too
short
for
the
planes.
the
park
is
big
enough
for
everybody
now.
the
third
argument
and
i
--
let
me
make
an
overall
point.
i
think
there
is
nothing
special
about
trust
law
that
exempts
it
from
the
command
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
not
as
the
fact
that
the
law
involved
is
common
law
and
that
statute
law
place
it
outside
the
reach
of
the
constitution.
we
think
this
point
is
amply
established
by
the
decision
last
termed
in
presbyterian
church
against
the
hall
church
where
the
court
unanimously
concluded
that
georgia
courts
deciding
a
common
law
trust
law
must
do
so
in
conformity
with
the
first
amendment
guarantees
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
innumerous
cases
and
all
--
in
different
context
make
the
point
of
our
common
law.
judge
may
law
being
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
new
york
times
against
sullivan
makes
that
point
in
very
plain
language.
the
state's
libel
law
has
to
march
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
edwards
against
south
carolina
involving
a
common
law
crime
illustrates
the
same
idea
in
another
context.
of
course
trust
law
is
normally
a
matter
for
state
determination.
of
course
georgia
has
the
last
word
in
defining
its
common
law
trust
as
a
general
matter
but
that
only
opens
the
question
we
submit
of
whether
the
law
is
settled
by
georgia
conforms
to
the
command
of
the
constitution
as
to
that
question
that
i
address
myself
with
these
four
arguments.
our
first
argument
as
i
indicated
is
rooted
in
the
fundamental
proposition
announced
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
in
1890.
the
states
have
no
power
to
take
action
hostile
to
a
national
interest
not
even
as
then
when
using
the
basic
taxing
problem
may
they
penalize
a
federal
interest.
and
we
think
the
decision
below
violates
the
command
of
federal
supremacy,
not
because
this
court's
mandate
has
been
directly
flouted,
but
rather
because
the
state
has
decreed
that
valuable
city
property
must
be
forfeited
entirely
on
the
ground
that
the
constitution
and
the
decision
of
this
court
require
that
the
city
admit
negroes
to
baconsfield.
we
complain
not
that
there
will
still
be
segregation.
we
can't
know
how
the
heirs
will
use
the
land.
we
complain
about
the
fact
of
the
forfeiture
itself
and
this
valuable
facility
which
is
valuable
to
the
taxpayers
in
part
because
of
its
--
of
the
original
value
and
in
part
because
the
taxpayers
have
added
to
it
in
multiple
ways,
is
being
taken
away
solely
to
prevent
negroes
from
using
this
park.
this
is
a
direct
drastic
sanction
against
compliance
with
what
the
constitution
compelled
and
this
court's
decision
compel.
now
here
the
sanction
has
the
added
characteristic
and
the
added
impact
of
discouraging
this
desegregation
just
as
in
the
prince
edward
county
school
closing
case.
the
case
--
the
closing
of
the
park
conveys
to
negroes
unmistakably
the
plain
message
that
if
you
will
search
your
fourteenth
amendment
rights
it
won't
get
you
anything.
all
you'll
do
is
destroy
the
parks
for
everyone
and
that
obviously
discourages
compliance
with
the
constitution.
that
might
be
our
--
the
only
possible
justification
that
might
be
offered
for
such
a
forfeiture
would
be
a
clear
direction
by
attesting
that
bacon
made
no
such
choice.
the
georgia
courts
made
this
choice.
our
respondents
argue
that
the
trust
fails
automatically
on
january
17,
1966,
the
day
the
moment
this
court
announced
its
decision.
that's
a
groundless
and
artificial
argument.
they
never
adopted
it
until
a
month
--
more
than
a
month
later.
the
minutes
of
their
board
meeting
at
page
346
of
the
appendix
show
that
in
the
board
of
marriages
of
baconsfield
discussing
this
court's
decision
didn't
conclude
that
it
reverted.
it
was
only
after
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
march
that
reverted,
the
disposition
became
announced
for
many
of
them
the
only
sound
jurisprudential
view
is
that
the
georgia
law
comes
from
human
decisions
and
this
is
the
premise
on
which
such
basic
law
is
uriah
against
tompkins
stands.
i
have
talked
a
little
bit
about
our
second
argument,
the
fact
that
nothing's
happened
which
prevents
white
women
and
children
from
using
the
park
and
the
point
we
make
in
our
brief
is
that
the
only
manner
in
which
the
state
court
could
have
logically
reached
its
conclusion
that
the
uses
of
the
trust
have
failed
is
by
a
legal
premise,
an
implicit
legal
premise,
that
negro
use
as
a
matter
of
law
diminishes
the
white
use
because
negroes
are
per
se
offensive
or
obnoxious.
and
such
a
ground
we
say,
imposes
a
badge
of
inferiority
on
blacks
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits.
we
do
not
contend
that
this
was
consciously
the
theory
adopted.
it
never
said
anything
like
that.
what
we
contend
is
that's
the
only
logical
foundation
on
which
the
conclusion
can
rest.
the
case
might
be
more
difficult
if
the
court
below
had
not
have
had
no
alternative
under
its
law
but
it
play
--
but
there
were
no
georgia
decisions.
no
one
has
come
up
with
any
settled
georgia
case
law
that
forced
this
resolve.
the
side
place
statute
offer
plain
alternative
and
the
only
case
that
has
ever
been
cited,
it
is
not
cited,
the
respondents
don't
cite
it
here
but
they
didn't
--
in
the
court
below.
this
is
adams
against
bass
case,
but
in
1855
georgia
refused
to
apply
cy
pres
to
resettle
slaves
in
certain
states
on
the
grounds
of
that
particular
states
would
not
receive
them
and
that's
the
only
case
they've
found.
it
is
before
the
civil
war
amendments
and
in
any
event
it
had
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
georgia
law
which
made
it
illegal
to
free
a
slave.
our
third
argument
which
i
will
not
have
time
to
argue
because
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
but
i
will
state
it.
it
follows
the
reasoning
in
mr.
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
evidence
against
newton,
we
add
to
that
only
that
this
georgia
law
in
1905
which
provided
for
racially
oriented
parks
it
facilitated
testators
making
brands
of
this
kind
but
beyond
that
we
think
that
the
law
plainly
encouraged
racial
discrimination,
and
it
--
as
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
1966
stated,
we
think
incurably
taints
the
racial
condition
in
the
trust
and
we
think
that
tainted
provision
should
not
be
given
any
effect,
should
not
be
even
be
given
effect
in
effecting
the
reverter.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
it's
still,
as
to
judges
the
white
women
and
children
and
negro
women
and
children
i
think
there
is
plainly
no
authorization
for
it
so
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
well
i
am
talking
about
69504
now.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
am
--
i
have
not
found
a
law
making
it
a
crime,
statewide.
there
were
certainly
local
laws
of
that
kind.
that
was
one
in
the
holmes
case,
holmes
against
--i
know
of
none
applying
to,
to
make
it
in
1914
,1912.
but
well
let
me
amend
that.
section
69505
which
is
the
companion
to
69504
made
it
the
obligation
of
the
city
to
use
its
police
powers
to
enforce
the
racial
condition
in
bacon's
trust.
so
as
soon
as
the
city
accepted
bacon's
trust,
bacon's
command
the
racism
did
become
the
law
of
macon
and
for
that
reason
additionally
we
urge
that
the
case
ought
to
be
treated
like
an
invalid
city
code.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
claiborne
yesterday
post
the
question
that
i
suggest
must
be
confronted.
isn't
it
really
true
as
he
said
that
the
state
statute
which
provide
and
in
terms
of
what
has
actually
been
done
in
this
case
would
be
pretty
obviously
on
constitution?
that
hypothetical
law
would
say
something
like
this
that
even
if
a
testator
expresses
no
intent
on
the
issue
of
reversion.
and
even
if
there
were
no
difficulties
in
administering
apart
nonracially
and
even
if
the
name
beneficiaries
could
still
get
benefit
and
there
benefit
was
not
diminish.
for
the
charitable
trust
to
the
way
racial
limitation
fails
if
federal
law
prevents
that
racial
limitation
from
being
imposed.
as
i
hear
urge
yesterday,
i
don't
think
if
really
can
make
a
difference
that
the
rule
have
just
stated
is
not
georgia's
common
law
and
not
a
statute
law
rule.
the
essence
of
the
case
i
think
is
simply
that
georgia
acting
through
its
courts
has
chosen
to
give
special
emphasis
to
the
racial
rule
and
to
destroy
a
public
park
and
give
it
away
or
rather
to
have
it
integrated.
by
this
decision
the
state
is
chosen
to
regard
the
racial
rule
as
the
essential
and
to
reject
the
idea
that
a
perpetual
park
is
the
purpose.
a
park
for
the
benefit
of
white
people
is
not
becoming
possible
or
illegal
and
this
is
clear
i
think,
if
one
accepts
the
simple
proposition
the
park
still
benefits
white
people
even
if
negroes
are
admitted
to
the
park
at
the
same
time.
and
today,
if
maybe
supposed
that
the
alexander
school
number
three,
a
public
school
right
across
the
street
from
the
park
is
using
that
playground
then
white
-
negro
children
at
that
school
are
playing
in
the
park
today.
the
judgment
stands
this
will
be
destroyed.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
yesterday,
if
our
position
would
be
different.
if
the
testator
provided
for
a
racial
reverted
and
i
said,
no.
i
think,
i
should
add
to
my
answer
that
the
definitive
article
on
this
subject
was
written
by
professor
hilarious
clark
in
the
lru
in
1957.
in
that
article
i
think,
contains
all
the
arguments
that
charitable
trust
are
really
totally
involved
in
state
action.
but
the
case
relied
on
by
the
heirs,
this
north
carolina
barringer
case.
i
think,
it
shows
the
difference
between
that
kind
of
case,
on
the
present
one.
in
that
case
which
is
discussed
at
pages
47
and
48
of
our
brief,
the
north
carolina
court
had
two
deeds
before
it.
and
one
deed
had
an
expressed
racial
reverted
and
the
court
gave
effect
to
it.
and
we
think
that
was
wrong
not
for
the
reasons
i
have
expressed
yesterday.
but
the
other
deed
in
that
case
didn't
have
it
good
--
it
had
a
racial
limitation
but
didn't
provide
a
condition
and
the
north
carolina
court
said,
it
wouldn't
step
in
and
make
the
racial
choice.
that's
what
--
and
it
said
second
situation
that
something
comfortable
to
that
second
deed
in
the
north
carolina
case
that
we
have
here.
it's
the
georgia
court
that
stepped
in
and
made
the
choice
that
today
no
park
is
to
be
preferred
to
an
integrated
park
and
bacon
really
didn't
make
that
choice.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
case
is
at
the
citation
of
the
bottom
of
page
47
of
our
brief.
it's
called
charlotte
park
and
recreation
commission
against
maryland,
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
they
don't
--
i
don't
read
them
to
interpret
bacon's
will
to
me
that
this
will
do
me
anything
other
than
what
we
contend.
that
he
wanted
a
park,
that
they
wanted
it
for
white
people
and
they
didn't
want
negroes
in
it,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
park.
there
is
no
--
their
decision
was
that
when
negroes
had
to
be
admitted
to
the
park
somehow
it
became
impossible
to
have
a
park,
did
become
impossible
to
have
an
all
white
park.
i
make
to
be
sure
there
is
a
kind
of
equality
created
by
destroying
the
park
for
everyone
since
before
only
negroes
were
excluded
and
now
everyone
is
excluded.
but
that
kind
of
superficial
equality
doesn't
for
me
fulfill
the
states
obligation
to
afford
negroes.
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
but
we
object
to
it
the
forfeiture
itself.
and
the
message
of
that
kind
of
forfeiture
decreed
by
state
law
it
seems
to
me
is
pretty
plain.
says
something
like
this
to
negroes,
it
says
that
the
law
honor
us
a
will
leaving
land
to
a
city
for
whites
only.
more
than
it
honors
your
right
to
come
on
city
property
and
says
that
your
presence
eventhough
lawful,
so
it
changes
the
character
of
a
public
park
that
the
law
prefers
no
park
to
a
park
open
to
you.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
i
have.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
view
is
that
there
were
no
georgia
cases
which
clearly
determined
this
that
the
statute
mr.
--
these
two
statutes
mr.
jones
has
referred
to
set
out
on
page
55
of
our
brief.
our
what
the
georgia
court
was
using
and
if
those
statutes
only
have
any
meaning
when
the
testators
intend
can't
be
follow.
that's
the
only
time
that
you
use
this
statutes
it
is
the
first
one,
when
a
valid
charitable
be
quest
is
incapable
for
some
reason
of
execution
in
the
exact
manner
provided
by
the
testator,
donor
or
founder.
the
court
of
equity
will
carried
into
effect
in
such
a
way
as
will
as
nearly
as
possible
effectuate
is
intention.
obviously,
bacon's
will
couldn't
be
carried
out
exactly
as
he
intended
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
answer
is
the
same
i
think,
we
don't
contend
that
we've
no
found
any
case
like
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
think
that
wherever
city
makes
a
present
political
judgment,
prudential
judgment
that
it
wants
to
abandon
a
public
facility
that
maybe
done.
however,
i
think
that
kind
of
decision
is
subject
to
examination
by
a
proper
court
as
to
whether
or
not
to
substitute
is
to
whether
they
are
really
doing
this
as
a
method
affording
desegregation,
for
example.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
the
qualification
for
practical
purposes
the
qualification
i
made
is
the
important
thing
because
here
the
purpose
is
admitted
there
is
no
doubt
at
all.
but
the
purpose
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
find
that
the
discriminatory
motive
in
this
case
from
the
start
to
the
finish
really
from
the
1905
statute
which
would
started
all
off,
from
the
action
of
the
georgia
courts
in
running
heir
as
a
white
only
park
all
those
years
using
the
taxpayers
money,
in
the
georgia
perhaps
city
running
at
all
issues
using
the
taxpayers
money.
from
the
action
of
the
georgia
courts
in
trying
to
evade
the
admission
of
negroes
by
removing
the
city's
trustee
and
now
in
the
present
decision
to
close
the
park
rather
than
that
they
have
negroes
in
it.
so,
i
think
the
state
action
in
that
case
start
to
finish.
thank
you
