justice

mr.
jones,
in
that
connection.
justice
potter
stewart
and
parking
back
to
the
earlier
question
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
harlan
as
i
read
the
petitioners
brief,
they
claim
at
least
that
this
was
a
new
application
basically
of
the
cy
pres
law
of
georgia
and
i'm
reading
from
page
57
of
their
brief.
briefly,
they
say
after
the
case
of
evans
that
didn't
pass
and
we
remember
what
that
was.
no
georgia
case
has
been
found
in
which
a
trust
was
allowed
to
fail
on
that
beneficiaries
and
trustee
were
still
on
being
and
when
the
intended
benefit
could
still
be
received
merely
because
the
trust
could
not
be
carried
out
in
a
manner
directed
by
the
said
law
or
because
its
benefit
were
extended
to
a
larger
class
without
it
anyway
diminishing
the
enjoyment
of
the
intended
beneficiaries
and
then
they
put
note
to
your
position
that
speaks
to
the
case
it
barres
having
been
decided
under
well
settled
principles
of
georgia
law
but
point
out
that
you
site
an
old
cases
anywhere
to
back
up
that
statement
as
if.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart

--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
as
i
said
the
claim
is
made
that
this
case
is
noble
application
or
failure
to
apply
the
cy
pres.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
what
is
that
case?
justice
