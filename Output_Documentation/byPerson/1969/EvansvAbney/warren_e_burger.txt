chief

i

the
--
chief

i
can
well
say
it
too
and
--
chief

as
a

matter
i
can
see
why
the

the
clients

not

to

that
question.
chief

e.

suppose
we
--
since
we
have
you
stopped
for
a
moment,
suppose
you
have
a
case
that
case
here
where
--
that
donor
in
1925
or
30
had
given
land
for
use
as
an
airport
and
for
no
other
purpose.
with
either
whether
private
reversion
clause
in
the
gift
or
subject
to
a
state
reversion
by
law
and
then
time
passed
and
the
city
grew
and
the
airplanes
got
bigger
and
neither
the
runways
and
by
rezoning
became
illegal
to
run
an
airport
at
that
place
so
that
you
have
a
comparable
posture
illegal
to
use
it
for
the
original
purpose.
would
you
--
do
you
see
any
parallel
there
or
is
that
a
totally
different
kind
of
problem?
chief

warren
e.

but
the
purpose
described
in
the
limitation
is
illegal
now,
is
it
not?
chief

e.

mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
think
mr.
claiborne
about
the
hypothetical
case
i
suggested
to
mr.
nabrit,
if
the
illegality
which
was
used
to
trigger
a
reversion
was
a
rezoning
which
had
made
the
use
of
the
land
no
longer
legal
and
permissible
as
an
airport?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
are
you
talking
about
some
form
of
cy
pres?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
injures
them
all
equally,
does
it
not
here?
i
think
in
several
respects
it
does
not
injure
them
all
equally
mr.
chief
justice.
first
it
is
--
i
think
plain
that
the
least
advantage
members
of
the
community
have
the
greater
need
for
the
park
and
therefore
suffer
more
by
its
closure.
but
that
is
a
small
part
of
our
argument.
it
does
favor
discrimination
and
discourage
challenges
to
discrimination
in
comparable
circumstances
when
challenging
the
exclusionary
policy
of
any
public
facility
which
is
subject
to
this
sort
of
condition
and
when
the
result
is
that
the
facility
is
closed
and
you
gain
nothing
by
your
efforts,
obviously
this
has
been
a
discouragement
to
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right
to
seek
entry
on
a
non
discriminatory
basis
to
public
facilities.
and
finally
there
is
always
the
injury
which
results
when
the
state
puts
its
power,
its
prestige,
its
official
declaration,
on
the
side
of
discrimination
and
sends
in
effect
the
entry
of
these
negroes
to
this
park
would
be
so
obnoxious
that
we
presume
senator
bacon
would
have
closed
his
park
rather
than
to
have
allowed
them
in.
the
case
would
be

you

you

which

that
there
is
no
purpose
to
which
they
could
put
this

as
a
park.
chief

that
your
argument?

do
you
think
it

no
difference
that
those

are
terms
