mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
here
today
in
behalf
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
because
we
in
agreement
with
mr.
winson
believe
that
this
is
a
landmark
case
with
the
national
labor
relations.
it
involves
the
question
as
we
have
indicated
of
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
may
dictate
the
terms
of
collective-bargaining
agreements.
it
has
never
done
this
before
and
it
seeks
to
do
so
here
and
notwithstanding
the
clear
language
of
section
8
(d).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
said
the
board
neither
the
board
nor
the
court
nor
even
any
commentator
has
suggested
up
to
this
case
that
the
board
has
the
power
to
dictate
and
tell
the
parties
to
a
collective-bargaining
association
that
these
are
the
terms
you
must
agree
to.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it's
never
been
directly
presented
to
this
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
it's
never
been
argued
to
this
court
of
course
by
implication
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
indicated
that
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
board
and
congress
indicated
that's
not
the
function
of
the
board.
so
that
that
is
really
the
question
that
we
have
here
today
as
whether
congress
meant
what
it
said
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
this
is
the
first
case
that's
ever
involved
this
question.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
right,
it
is
the
point.
on
a
point
that
it’s
never
been
done
because
it’s
going
to
presumes
that
the
board
this
is
the
kind
of
a
decision
that
the
board
should
not
be
required
to
make
and
should
not
be
made
by
virtue
of
section
8
(d).
section
8
(d)
is
not
a
limitation
only
on
the
board’s
finding
of
good
faith,
it
affects
all
the
policies
of
the
act
that
can
this
court
indicated
in
defense
deal
case.
the
board
seeks
in
this
case
that
also
to
invoke
this
remedy
not
withstanding
that
it
is
decided
that
the
remedy
wasn't
required
here
and
the
fact
to
decide
that
that
contempt
powers
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
traditional
means
of
obtaining
compliance
with
board
orders
should
not
be
utilized
in
this
case.
it's
difficult
to
understand
therefore
how
this
case
can
be
viewed
by
the
respondent
is
one
of
only
minor
significance.
if
the
board
has
the
power
in
this
case,
there
has
a
power
in
any
case
whatever
it
concludes
that
a
party
either
a
company
or
a
union
did
not
articulate
the
sufficient
justification
or
a
sufficient
business
reason
or
a
union
reason
for
refusing
to
accept
the
proposal
that
he
could
then
compel
acceptance
to
that
proposal
and
regulate
the
results
of
collective-bargaining
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
employer
cannot
use
bargaining
as
a
cloak
cause
i
think
the
fifth
circuit,
a
cloak
or
a
device
to
preclude
agreement.
i
think
the
question
is,
did
he
seek
an
overall
agreement.
i
think
the
board
cannot
say
by
virtue
of
section
8
(d)
that
an
employer
who
refuses
to
accept
any
particular
proposal
has
therefore
violated
the
act.
it
is
not
a
per
se
type
of
violation,
you
offer
to
checkoff,
we
do
not
accept
that
therefore,
we
have
violated
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
suggest
that
the
board
has
not
only
a
general
bargaining
power
that's
remedial
action.
it
has
numerous
weapons.
it
has
a
lot
of
ingenuity
in
devising
appropriate
remedies.
if
those
remedies
fail
for
some
reason,
then
there
is
a
contempt
power
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
viewing
this
case
in
contempt
would
now
look
to
the
narrow
question.
did
you
or
did
you
command
a
checkoff.
they
found
bad
faith
in
this
case
originally
because
the
employer
had
an
anti
--
had
negotiated
with
anti-union
animus.
he
refused
to
accept
any
form
of
dues
collection
not
only
a
checkoff.
he
voiced
an
attitude
here
that
which
the
board
felt
dissipated
indicated
disparagement
of
the
union.
so
that
when
a
case
we
arrived
in
a
contempt,
the
court
of
appeals
would
indicate
does
the
employer
still
using
the
same
negotiator?
has
he
gone
up
for
any
form
of
dues
collection?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct
and
if
that
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
by
force
of
the
language
of
the
8
(d)
and
the
policy
that
purveys
the
act
that
the
parties
are
the
ones
to
decide
what
other
kinds
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
it
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
union
that
what
they're
trying
to
do
here
is
an
effect
engaged
in
a
test
or
remedial
reform
that
because
of
this
problem
that
you
just
post
which
i
think
is
the
rare
one,
but
because
of
their
problem,
the
board
has
to
devise
some
kind
of
weapon
here.
well,
that's
true
and
i
don't
accept
it
to
be
the
bet.
but
if
that's
true
then
that
is
the
function
of
the
legislature
i
suggest
and
not
of
the
courts.
if
the
remedies
are
inadequate
here,
if
there's
a
case
in
which
it's
absolutely
necessary
that
there
be
a
compelled
agreement
despite
language
in
8
(d),
then
the
legislature
should
put
that
in
the
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
the
act
that
indicates
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
is
a
direct
prohibition
in
the
act
and
because
of
their
prohibition,
section
8
(d)
as
you
cannot
compel
agreement,
that's
not
a
bad
faith.
but
the
device
of
issuing
a
remedy
correct
their
problem
is
indeed
compelling
agreement
and
that's
the
crux
that
i
think
about
our
position
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
had
initially
filed
the
motion
to
leave
to
argue
in
15
minutes
which
was
granted
but
i
see
that
some
part
of
their
time
has
been
assumed.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
company
and
the
chamber
are
here
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
here
today
in

of
the

of

and

mr.

neither

mr.

and
it's

this

indicated
that
that

not

and
congress
indicated
that's
not
the
function
of
the

so
that
that
is
really
the
question
that
we
have
here
today
as
whether
congress
meant
what
it
said
--
mr.
lawrence
m.

yes?
mr.

mr.
lawrence
m.

that's

mr.

that's

it's

to
understand
therefore
how
