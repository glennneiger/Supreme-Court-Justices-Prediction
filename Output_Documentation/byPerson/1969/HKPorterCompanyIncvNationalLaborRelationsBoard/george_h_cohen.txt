mr.
george
h.
cohen
united
steelworkers
of
america,
we’re
the
charging
party
for
the
national
labor
relations
board,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
thank
you,
sir.
the
company
and
the
chamber
are
here
today
not
to
challenge
any
of
the
findings
or
fact
made
by
national
labor
relations
board
not
to
question
the
fact
that
they
were
motivated
by
bad
faith
and
refuse
to
enter
into
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
not
to
question
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
case
if
the
board
had
the
power
to
compel
a
concession.
this
case
was
a
proper
exercise
of
that
power.
the
company
and
the
chamber
are
here
on
the
bold
face
of
legal
proposition
that
irrespective
of
bad
faith,
irrespective
of
their
recidivism,
irrespective
of
all
of
these
things.
the
simple
fact
remains
the
board
lacks
the
power
to
compel
them
to
exact
a
concession
of
the
kind
that
was
exacted
in
this
case.
now,
in
support
of
that
legal
position,
the
company
and
the
chamber
have
relied
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
compel
an
agreement
--
to
compel
an
agreement,
require
an
agreement
or
compel
a
concession.
i
was
using
the
word
“exact”
with
compel.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i'm
referring
your
honor
to
the
statutory
language
of
making
a
concession
in
the
company’s
view
this
was
making
them
concede
to
something
by
having
to
execute
it
to
the
contract.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
it
required
an
agreement
of
this
nature.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
now,
in
support
of
this
proposition,
the
company
relies
on
what
it
looks
to
the
statutory
language
of
8
(d)
and
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d).
now,
we
submit
and
we
have
dealt
with
this
at
length
on
our
brief
that
8
(d)
was
the
setup
and
established
to
define
more
clearly
what
the
statutory
obligation
to
confer
in
good
faith
meant
and
the
whole
thrust
of
8
(d)
is
conferring
in
good
faith.
it
is
true
that
to
the
extent
that
congress
recognized
that
an
employer
who
is
bargaining
in
good
faith
is
entitled
to
the
freedom
of
contract
principles.
that
employer
who
was
bargaining
in
good
faith
cannot
be
compelled
to
make
a
concession
and
cannot
be
required
to
make
an
agreement.
that
is
the
express
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
and
that
there's
no
illusion
whatsoever
to
the
question
of
what
about
this
employer
who's
acting
in
bad
faith,
what
congress
was
disturbed
about
and
what
the
language
of
the
section
is
addressed
himself
to
is
the
question
of
the
board’s
prior
practice
of
having
look
into
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
of
a
company
response
to
a
union
demand
at
the
bargaining
table
and
say,
well,
the
union's
demand
look
fairly
reasonable
and
therefore
when
the
company
responded
negatively,
that’s
indicia
of
bad
faith,
that's
the
practice
that
congress
was
addressing
itself.
that
is
not
a
situation
we
have
here,
there's
no
argument
being
made
by
the
chamber
or
the
company
that
the
board’s
finding
of
fact
namely
that
the
company’s
position
with
respect
to
dues
checkoff
was
taken
for
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
agreement
transgress
8
(d).
the
company
isn't
arguing
that
the
basic
finding
of
a
statutory
violation
here
in
anyway
was
precluded
by
8
(d).
on
the
contrary,
the
company
in
effect
is
saying
that
we
not
withstanding
our
bad
faith
have
been
giving
an
(inaudible)
by
the
congress
in
that
this
basic
freedom
of
contract
principle
found
in
8
(d)
which
are
obviously
are
not
entitled
to
under
the
little
language
of
8
(d)
because
we
were
not
conferring
in
good
faith.
nonetheless,
that
language
is
imported
and
transformed
over
the
10
(c).
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no.
your
honor
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
first
and
we
have
addressed
themselves
to
that
in
a
brief
and
i
will
be
delighted
briefly
to
do
so
here.
but
it
seems
that
what
we
are
saying
here
is
we
have
a
serious
question
whether
or
not
a
bad
faith
employer
or
bad
faith
any
party
has
any
right
at
all
to
rely
on
the
statutory
language
of
8
(d).
we
acknowledge
however
that
not
withstanding
this
foreclosure
that
there's
still
is
running
through
the
labor
act
a
basic
policy
of
freedom
of
contract.
but
of
course
as
this
court
said
in
the
machinist
local
versus
nlrb,
when
you
look
at
the
act,
there's
only
one
way
to
determine
the
national
labor
policy,
that's
not
one
section
of
the
act,
that's
the
entire
act.
and
as
a
result
of
that
fact,
this
court
on
numerous
instances
has
mandated
an
approach
to
remedy
which
in
effect
says
many
times
we
have
to
fashion
competing,
balancing,
conflicting
policies.
this
is
one
such
instance
we
say
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
is
an
instance
quite
obviously
and
indeed
the
court
below
recognized
this
very
fact.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
think
i
would
respond
by
saying
when
you
say
“but
to
leave
the
substantive
terms
to
the
parties.”
this
is
always
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
people
who
are
in
good
faith
trying
to
arrive
at
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
this
is
and
this
is
what
was
recognized
by
the
court
below
and
they
said,
we
recognized
that
is
here
a
minor
intrusion
into
the
freedom
of
contract
even
if
the
employer
is
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
that
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
that
language
i
believe,
that
holds
segment
of
the
legislative
history
which
you
have
so
ably
referred
to
in
insurance
agents.
that
all,
i
repeat
presupposes
a
good
faith
bargaining
posture.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
when
we
transpose
it
into
look
at
10
(c).
the
board
is
empowered
with
the
broad
authority
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
when
mr.
justice
black
at
an
earlier
time
the
hearing
raised
the
question
of,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
points
the
giving
the
board
this
power.
i
think
the
answer
is
twofold.
obviously,
8
(d)
didn’t
addressed
itself
to
this
problem
because
8
(d)
presuppose
good
faith
bargaining
but
in
10
(c),
numerous
congressmen
got
up
and
said,
now,
what
kinds
of
problems
are
going
to
be
confronted
to
the
labor
board
and
how
can
we
delineate
what
their
authority
should
be
in
remedying
those
problems.
and
the
congress
came
to
the
conclusion
and
this
court
has
referred
to
this
fact
in
many
of
their
decisions
sever-up
bottling,
phelps
dodge,
there
is
an
enormous
amalgam
of
potential
problems,
very
bold
depending
on
the
facts
of
every
case.
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
empower
the
board
to
issue
what
affirmative
action
it
believes
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
obviously,
that
is
not
unreviewable
unlimited
discretion,
but
it
is
a
basic
discretion
and
indirectly
i
would
submit
to
you.
it
addressed
itself
to
the
type
of
problem
that
you
are
speaking
about.
i
would
say
indirectly
in
10
(c),
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
board
could
issue
an
order
of
that
sort
that
it
issued
here.
and
what
we
say
is
the
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i'm
arguing
for
the
board’s
order
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
board
discretion
that
the
congress
left
would
be
nlrb
in
section
10
(c)
supports
the
issuance
of
a
remedy
that
was
issued
in
this
particular
case.
it
involved
the
problem
having
to
fashion
and
compete
conflicting
policies.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no
your
honor
i'm
not
but
i
am
--
what
i'm
saying
is
10
(c)
empowers
the
board
to
take
the
effective
action
that
is
necessary
to
remedy
the
particular
violation
found
in
giving
case.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
there
could
certainly
be
a
situation
where
a
--
this
is
happened
numerous
times
before
this
case
so
yes
your
honor
but
there's
been
a
violation
found.
let's
talk
in
terms
of
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
you
mean
are
they
bargaining
in
bad
faith
that
we
got
a
basic
finding
of
bad-faith
bargaining
when
you
say
stick
to
one
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
the
mere
fact
that
an
interest
that
they
are
not
interested,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
determined.
i
think
this
case
highlights
that
problem.
here,
is
an
employer
who
--
for
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
agreement
over
this
five-year
period
took
a
position
on
dues
checkoff.
he
went
to
the
union
jaggedly.
he
knew
this
is
what
the
union
wanted,
he
made
the
judgment
that
he
was
not
going
to
execute
an
agreement
and
he
was
going
to
use
dues
checkoff
as
a
device
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement.
but
we
had
something
beyond
that
year
because
not
only
was
he
using
it
as
a
device
to
frustrate
agreements,
he
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
no
possible
conceivable
legitimate
purpose
for
refusing
to
grant
the
checkoff.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
in
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
he
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
administrative
inconvenience
indeed
he
had
been
checking
off
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
he
was
against
it
--
he
was
against
it
for
a
bad
faith
purpose
of
frustrating
collective-bargaining
that
was
the
key
to
the
finding.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
we
had
no
bad
faith
on
either
side
of
table
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
violation
that
we
wouldn’t
be
involved
in
these
remedies
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
bad
faith
has
we
all
acknowledged
and
we
realized
when
it
was
written
into
the
statute
is
a
subjective
standard
but
nevertheless,
it
is
one
of
the
basic
course
of
the
entire
labor
act.
it
is
true
that
it
requires
the
determination
of
what
was
the
employer’s
motivation
but
as
you
indicated
earlier
today
let's
assume
that
an
employer
setout
with
the
purpose
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement,
but
he
had
to
make
a
judgment.
how
i'll
going
to
keep
from
reaching
an
agreement
with
this
union?
i'll
look
to
what
one
of
their
key
where
that
key
demand
us
and
i'll
use
that.
i'll
use
that
as
the
device
to
foreclose
reaching
an
agreement
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
company
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
believe
it
is
clearly
in
the
record
that
the
union
was
insisting
on
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
don't
know
of
those
specific
words
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely,
but
the
key
distinguishing
factor
mr.
chief
justice
is
nothing
under
this
act
to
preclude
a
party
from
adamantly
in
good
faith
insisting
on
a
particular
bargaining
position.
no
one
has
suggested
to
the
contrary,
the
key
thing
that
distinguishes
this
particular
case
and
in
a
sense
you
referred
to
it
in
your
dissent
in
ronald
was
the
crucial
finding
that
it
was
bad
faith
that
motivated
this
employer.
he
chose
to
pick
the
dues
checkoff
issue
as
his
device
to
frustrate
reaching
the
agreement.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that
is
not
the
problem
that
we
have
before
us
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
question
of
being
--
of
standing
forth
forward
ones
position.
this
is
a
case
(voice
overlaps)
and
we
say
it
was
a
finding.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
the
essence
of
bargaining
is
i'm
sure
you
are
well
aware
is
to
behave
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
good
faith
requirement
of
the
statute
and
where
that
finding
is
made
as
it
was
made
here
and
where
this
company
has
put
themselves
into
this
box
where
they
were
using
the
checkoff
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement.
and
indeed
had
no
legitimate
reason,
we
say
that
would
be
inappropriate
remedy
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
this,
i
don't
--
as
a
so
often
the
case,
the
legislative
history
of
statutes
don't
communicate
there
are
the
legislature’s
concern
with
every
potential
problem
that
could
have
been
post.
and
i
think
quite
the
contrary
that
congress
intentionally
left
10
(c)
framed
in
a
very
broad
terms
that
was
framed
namely
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
because
they
recognized
that
they're
were
going
to
be
on
entirely
difficult
number
of
situations
that
were
going
to
come
up
and
they
didn’t
want
to
confine
the
agency
that
was
administering
the
statute
to
one
limited
or
two
or
three
specified
remedies.
but
i
think
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
your
honor
we
have
an
extra
ordinarily
unique
situation
there
is
a
mr.
cohen
represented
chamber
of
commerce.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
united
steelworkers
of
america,
we’re
the
charging
party
for
the
national
labor
relations
board,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
thank
you,
sir.
the
company
and
the
chamber
are
here
today
not
to
challenge
any
of
the
findings
or
fact
made
by
national
labor
relations
board
not
to
question
the
fact
that
they
were
motivated
by
bad
faith
and
refuse
to
enter
into
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
and
not
to
question
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
case
if
the
board
had
the
power
to
compel
a
concession.
this
case
was
a
proper
exercise
of
that
power.
the
company
and
the
chamber
are
here
on
the
bold
face
of
legal
proposition
that
irrespective
of
bad
faith,
irrespective
of
their
recidivism,
irrespective
of
all
of
these
things.
the
simple
fact
remains
the
board
lacks
the
power
to
compel
them
to
exact
a
concession
of
the
kind
that
was
exacted
in
this
case.
now,
in
support
of
that
legal
position,
the
company
and
the
chamber
have
relied
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
compel
an
agreement
--
to
compel
an
agreement,
require
an
agreement
or
compel
a
concession.
i
was
using
the
word
“exact”
with
compel.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i'm
referring
your
honor
to
the
statutory
language
of
making
a
concession
in
the
company’s
view
this
was
making
them
concede
to
something
by
having
to
execute
it
to
the
contract.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
it
required
an
agreement
of
this
nature.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
now,
in
support
of
this
proposition,
the
company
relies
on
what
it
looks
to
the
statutory
language
of
8
(d)
and
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d).
now,
we
submit
and
we
have
dealt
with
this
at
length
on
our
brief
that
8
(d)
was
the
setup
and
established
to
define
more
clearly
what
the
statutory
obligation
to
confer
in
good
faith
meant
and
the
whole
thrust
of
8
(d)
is
conferring
in
good
faith.
it
is
true
that
to
the
extent
that
congress
recognized
that
an
employer
who
is
bargaining
in
good
faith
is
entitled
to
the
freedom
of
contract
principles.
that
employer
who
was
bargaining
in
good
faith
cannot
be
compelled
to
make
a
concession
and
cannot
be
required
to
make
an
agreement.
that
is
the
express
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
and
that
there's
no
illusion
whatsoever
to
the
question
of
what
about
this
employer
who's
acting
in
bad
faith,
what
congress
was
disturbed
about
and
what
the
language
of
the
section
is
addressed
himself
to
is
the
question
of
the
board’s
prior
practice
of
having
look
into
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
of
a
company
response
to
a
union
demand
at
the
bargaining
table
and
say,
well,
the
union's
demand
look
fairly
reasonable
and
therefore
when
the
company
responded
negatively,
that’s
indicia
of
bad
faith,
that's
the
practice
that
congress
was
addressing
itself.
that
is
not
a
situation
we
have
here,
there's
no
argument
being
made
by
the
chamber
or
the
company
that
the
board’s
finding
of
fact
namely
that
the
company’s
position
with
respect
to
dues
checkoff
was
taken
for
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
agreement
transgress
8
(d).
the
company
isn't
arguing
that
the
basic
finding
of
a
statutory
violation
here
in
anyway
was
precluded
by
8
(d).
on
the
contrary,
the
company
in
effect
is
saying
that
we
not
withstanding
our
bad
faith
have
been
giving
an
(inaudible)
by
the
congress
in
that
this
basic
freedom
of
contract
principle
found
in
8
(d)
which
are
obviously
are
not
entitled
to
under
the
little
language
of
8
(d)
because
we
were
not
conferring
in
good
faith.
nonetheless,
that
language
is
imported
and
transformed
over
the
10
(c).
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no.
your
honor
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
first
and
we
have
addressed
themselves
to
that
in
a
brief
and
i
will
be
delighted
briefly
to
do
so
here.
but
it
seems
that
what
we
are
saying
here
is
we
have
a
serious
question
whether
or
not
a
bad
faith
employer
or
bad
faith
any
party
has
any
right
at
all
to
rely
on
the
statutory
language
of
8
(d).
we
acknowledge
however
that
not
withstanding
this
foreclosure
that
there's
still
is
running
through
the
labor
act
a
basic
policy
of
freedom
of
contract.
but
of
course
as
this
court
said
in
the
machinist
local
versus
nlrb,
when
you
look
at
the
act,
there's
only
one
way
to
determine
the
national
labor
policy,
that's
not
one
section
of
the
act,
that's
the
entire
act.
and
as
a
result
of
that
fact,
this
court
on
numerous
instances
has
mandated
an
approach
to
remedy
which
in
effect
says
many
times
we
have
to
fashion
competing,
balancing,
conflicting
policies.
this
is
one
such
instance
we
say
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
is
an
instance
quite
obviously
and
indeed
the
court
below
recognized
this
very
fact.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
think
i
would
respond
by
saying
when
you
say
“but
to
leave
the
substantive
terms
to
the
parties.”
this
is
always
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
people
who
are
in
good
faith
trying
to
arrive
at
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
this
is
and
this
is
what
was
recognized
by
the
court
below
and
they
said,
we
recognized
that
is
here
a
minor
intrusion
into
the
freedom
of
contract
even
if
the
employer
is
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
that
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
that
language
i
believe,
that
holds
segment
of
the
legislative
history
which
you
have
so
ably
referred
to
in
insurance
agents.
that
all,
i
repeat
presupposes
a
good
faith
bargaining
posture.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
when
we
transpose
it
into
look
at
10
(c).
the
board
is
empowered
with
the
broad
authority
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
when
mr.
justice
black
at
an
earlier
time
the
hearing
raised
the
question
of,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
points
the
giving
the
board
this
power.
i
think
the
answer
is
twofold.
obviously,
8
(d)
didn’t
addressed
itself
to
this
problem
because
8
(d)
presuppose
good
faith
bargaining
but
in
10
(c),
numerous
congressmen
got
up
and
said,
now,
what
kinds
of
problems
are
going
to
be
confronted
to
the
labor
board
and
how
can
we
delineate
what
their
authority
should
be
in
remedying
those
problems.
and
the
congress
came
to
the
conclusion
and
this
court
has
referred
to
this
fact
in
many
of
their
decisions
sever-up
bottling,
phelps
dodge,
there
is
an
enormous
amalgam
of
potential
problems,
very
bold
depending
on
the
facts
of
every
case.
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
empower
the
board
to
issue
what
affirmative
action
it
believes
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
obviously,
that
is
not
unreviewable
unlimited
discretion,
but
it
is
a
basic
discretion
and
indirectly
i
would
submit
to
you.
it
addressed
itself
to
the
type
of
problem
that
you
are
speaking
about.
i
would
say
indirectly
in
10
(c),
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
board
could
issue
an
order
of
that
sort
that
it
issued
here.
and
what
we
say
is
the
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i'm
arguing
for
the
board’s
order
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
board
discretion
that
the
congress
left
would
be
nlrb
in
section
10
(c)
supports
the
issuance
of
a
remedy
that
was
issued
in
this
particular
case.
it
involved
the
problem
having
to
fashion
and
compete
conflicting
policies.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no
your
honor
i'm
not
but
i
am
--
what
i'm
saying
is
10
(c)
empowers
the
board
to
take
the
effective
action
that
is
necessary
to
remedy
the
particular
violation
found
in
giving
case.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
there
could
certainly
be
a
situation
where
a
--
this
is
happened
numerous
times
before
this
case
so
yes
your
honor
but
there's
been
a
violation
found.
let's
talk
in
terms
of
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
you
mean
are
they
bargaining
in
bad
faith
that
we
got
a
basic
finding
of
bad-faith
bargaining
when
you
say
stick
to
one
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
the
mere
fact
that
an
interest
that
they
are
not
interested,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
determined.
i
think
this
case
highlights
that
problem.
here,
is
an
employer
who
--
for
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
agreement
over
this
five-year
period
took
a
position
on
dues
checkoff.
he
went
to
the
union
jaggedly.
he
knew
this
is
what
the
union
wanted,
he
made
the
judgment
that
he
was
not
going
to
execute
an
agreement
and
he
was
going
to
use
dues
checkoff
as
a
device
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement.
but
we
had
something
beyond
that
year
because
not
only
was
he
using
it
as
a
device
to
frustrate
agreements,
he
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
no
possible
conceivable
legitimate
purpose
for
refusing
to
grant
the
checkoff.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
in
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
he
acknowledged
that
there
was
no
administrative
inconvenience
indeed
he
had
been
checking
off
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
he
was
against
it
--
he
was
against
it
for
a
bad
faith
purpose
of
frustrating
collective-bargaining
that
was
the
key
to
the
finding.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
we
had
no
bad
faith
on
either
side
of
table
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
violation
that
we
wouldn’t
be
involved
in
these
remedies
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
bad
faith
has
we
all
acknowledged
and
we
realized
when
it
was
written
into
the
statute
is
a
subjective
standard
but
nevertheless,
it
is
one
of
the
basic
course
of
the
entire
labor
act.
it
is
true
that
it
requires
the
determination
of
what
was
the
employer’s
motivation
but
as
you
indicated
earlier
today
let's
assume
that
an
employer
setout
with
the
purpose
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement,
but
he
had
to
make
a
judgment.
how
i'll
going
to
keep
from
reaching
an
agreement
with
this
union?
i'll
look
to
what
one
of
their
key
where
that
key
demand
us
and
i'll
use
that.
i'll
use
that
as
the
device
to
foreclose
reaching
an
agreement
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
company
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
believe
it
is
clearly
in
the
record
that
the
union
was
insisting
on
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
don't
know
of
those
specific
words
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely,
but
the
key
distinguishing
factor
mr.
chief
justice
is
nothing
under
this
act
to
preclude
a
party
from
adamantly
in
good
faith
insisting
on
a
particular
bargaining
position.
no
one
has
suggested
to
the
contrary,
the
key
thing
that
distinguishes
this
particular
case
and
in
a
sense
you
referred
to
it
in
your
dissent
in
ronald
was
the
crucial
finding
that
it
was
bad
faith
that
motivated
this
employer.
he
chose
to
pick
the
dues
checkoff
issue
as
his
device
to
frustrate
reaching
the
agreement.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that
is
not
the
problem
that
we
have
before
us
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
question
of
being
--
of
standing
forth
forward
ones
position.
this
is
a
case
(voice
overlaps)
and
we
say
it
was
a
finding.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
the
essence
of
bargaining
is
i'm
sure
you
are
well
aware
is
to
behave
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
good
faith
requirement
of
the
statute
and
where
that
finding
is
made
as
it
was
made
here
and
where
this
company
has
put
themselves
into
this
box
where
they
were
using
the
checkoff
to
frustrate
reaching
an
agreement.
and
indeed
had
no
legitimate
reason,
we
say
that
would
be
inappropriate
remedy
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
this,
i
don't
--
as
a
so
often
the
case,
the
legislative
history
of
statutes
don't
communicate
there
are
the
legislature’s
concern
with
every
potential
problem
that
could
have
been
post.
and
i
think
quite
the
contrary
that
congress
intentionally
left
10
(c)
framed
in
a
very
broad
terms
that
was
framed
namely
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
because
they
recognized
that
they're
were
going
to
be
on
entirely
difficult
number
of
situations
that
were
going
to
come
up
and
they
didn’t
want
to
confine
the
agency
that
was
administering
the
statute
to
one
limited
or
two
or
three
specified
remedies.
but
i
think
--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
your
honor
we
have
an
extra
ordinarily
unique
situation
there
is
a
mr.
cohen
represented
chamber
of
commerce.
