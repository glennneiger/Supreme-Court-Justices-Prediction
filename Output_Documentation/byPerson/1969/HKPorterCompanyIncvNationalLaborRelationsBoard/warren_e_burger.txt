a

will
counsel.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're

chief

warren
e.

in
other
words
that
the
board
said
that
this
was
a
demand
of
the
union
to
which
the
company
must
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
not
the
original
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
very
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
in
the
appendix
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
get
to
us
in
both
--
give
us
both
citations
if
you
will.
chief

warren
e.
burger
of
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
too
clear
on
your
response
about
the
factor
of
good
faith.
let
me
try
it
with
a
hypothetical.
suppose
in
a
period
when
and
in
an
area
when
increases
are
being
granted
of
5
cents
in
hour
widely
in
an
industry,
a
particular
employer
receives
an
offer
from
the
union
--
demand
from
the
union
for
5-cent
an
hour
increase
very
modest
demand,
much
below
the
others
and
an
employer
refuses
to
grant
any
increase.
do
you
think
that
the
board
can
inquire
into
the
good
faith
or
bad
faith
or
presence
or
absence
of
either
and
use
it
as
a
basis
to
direct
the
employer
to
grant
a
5-cent
an
hour
increase?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
remedy
problem
here,
aren't
we.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
won't
help
much
here.
even
the
majority
opinion
doesn't
help
you
very
much
from
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
must
pick
a
much
better
authority
from
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
he
must
do
that,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
board
see
in
that
light
in
the
first
instance
before
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
first
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
can
do
with
this
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
the
refusal
to
agree
with
checkoff
frustrates
any
agreement
with
the
union
unless
the
union
said
they
wouldn’t
agree
to
any
contract
without
a
checkoff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
only
way
it
could
produce
some
impasse,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
employer
wanted
to
save
the
checkoff
concession
for
a
year
when
he
couldn't
depart
to
give
a
very
large
wage
increase?
once
he
knew
it
was
quite
important
to
the
union,
was
that
--
would
that
be
a
legitimate
business
reason
to
save
it
for
the
future?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
add
to
that,
especially
if
the
corporation
said
if
the
employers
said,
we're
a
corporate
body
and
our
ability
to
agree
cannot
be
to
make
contracts,
cannot
be
delegated
by
us
to
anyone
else,
suppose
they
added
that
to
justice
brennan’s?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
saving
it
for
the
future
that
i
mentioned
before,
would
that
be
a
legitimate
business
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
not
coming
to
other
thing.
are
you
suggesting
that
it’s
the
obligation
of
either
the
union
or
the
employer
all
these
to
reveal
all
the
reasons
why
they
do
or
do
not
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
it
was
the
essence
of
negotiation
that
a
negotiator
was
entitled
to
keep
his
cards
covered.
i
think
we’ll
stop
for
lunch
now.
[lunch
recess]
well,
we
have
you
stopped
counsel.
let
me
put
another
hypothetical
to
you
to
pursue
something
that
justice
brennan
opened
up
on
the
reciprocity
or
two-way
aspect
of
this
kind
of
a
remedy.
suppose
for
example
an
employer
made
a
demand
for
a
provision
in
the
union
contract
that
the
bargaining
team
they
made
up
of
such
officers
as
the
union
would
designate
but
that
it
would
always
include
three
members
of
the
workforce
of
the
particular
unit.
and
that
he
then
asserted
that
this
was
because
he
wanted
to
encourage
the
union
democracy
and
develop
the
sense
of
responsibility
to
the
leadership
of
the
union
etcetera.
the
union
says,
no,
we'll
do
this
our
own
way.
business
agents
as
we
--
i
don't
want
any
spies
in
here.
and
they
found
her
on
that
demand
and
have
a
complete
impasse
and
get
to
just
about
where
we
are
here.
do
you
think
the
board
could
order
the
union
to
agree
to
that
provision
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
dues
checkoff
get
to
be
negotiable
bargaining
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
how
did
it
generally?
i
suppose
when
unions
began
they
didn't
have
any
checkoff,
it's
a
fairly
recent
development,
isn't
it
in
the
history
of
bargaining?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
certainly
be
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
labor
act
and
the
landrum-griffin
and
the
great
many
things
to
improve
union
democracy
this
way,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
picked
one
that
would
be
within
the
orbit
of
mandatory
bargaining.
can
you
suggest
one
that
under
any
circumstance
that
the
board
could
ever
order
the
union
to
agree
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
black
has
a
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
come.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
got
about
10
minutes
that
is
left
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
if
you
run
under
pressure
we
will
take
that
into
account.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
very
word
“concession”
implies
agreement
however
reluctant
doesn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
counsel
this
morning
mr.
cohen
mentioned
that
the
union
come
witness
for
speaking
for
the
union
said,
they
would
never
agree
to
agreement
without
a
checkoff,
is
that
in
the
record
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
would
not
sign
a
contract
without
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
for
the
moment
whoever
said
that
was
accurate,
would
you
think
that
was
in
adamancy
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you're
then
doing
on
the
same
theory
that
mr.
come
suggested
that
a
bargainer
is
always
obliges
to
state
all
of
his
reasons
(voice
overlaps)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
reasons
i'm
talking
about
the
reasons
for
the
position.
i
have
thought
it
was
the
essence
of
the
bargaining
that
you
are
not
obliged
to
disclose
all
your
reasons
and
to
think
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
the
question
on
10
(c)
that
you
mentioned
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
latter
part
of
10
(c)
where
the
statute
discusses
under
what
circumstances
where
it
says,
and
to
take
such
affirmative
action
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
bad
faith.
now,
i
would
assume
you
would
agree
that
the
drastic
remedy
applied
here
is
something
more
stringent
than
a
command
signed
a
particular
contract.
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
congress
intended
to
include
any
such
provision
as
a
command
to
agree
in
a
particular
clause
they
would’ve
listed
that
in
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
now
mr.
cohen
if
you
got
to
close.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
two,
you
should
get
along
better.[laughing]
chief

warren
e.

that's

you
have
--
mr.

will
you
indicate
it?
eleven

chief

e.
