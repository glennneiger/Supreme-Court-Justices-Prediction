mr.
donald
c.
winson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
short
certiorari
to
review
a
per
curiam
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
which
enforce
a
supplemental
order
of
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board's
order
was
entered
that
gives
the
petitioner
h.
k.
porter
company
supposedly
as
a
remedy
for
bad-faith
bargaining
in
violation
of
section
885
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
more
specifically,
the
company
was
found
to
have
refused
to
agree
to
a
union's
demand
for
a
dues
checkoff
provision
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement
with
the
union.
the
board
supplemental
order
which
is
the
focal
point
of
this
controversy
before
this
court
requires
the
company
to
“grant
to
the
union
a
contract
clause
providing
for
the
checkoff
of
union
dues.”
the
very
precise,
very
clear
cut
issue
now
presented
is
whether
the
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
the
power
to
order
a
party
to
agree
to
a
substantive
provision
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
company
of
course
takes
position
that
board
has
not
has
such
power.
the
board
now
says
that
it
has
the
power
to
order
agreement
to
a
substantive
provision.
the
bargaining
that's
actually
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
substantive
provision
mr.
justice
black
was
a
dues
checkoff
provision
--
a
provision
of
course
and
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
by
which
the
company
pays
and
assist
the
union
in
the
collection
of
dues
by
deducting
the
due
--
union
dues
from
the
employees’
wages
and
then
transmits
them
to
the
union.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
way
the
case
worked
out
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
it
actually
worked
that
way.
the
court
of
appeals
is
actually
if
i
may
say
so
the
instigator
of
the
remedy
here
is
as
to
what
has
occurred.
this
case
went
through
the
examiner.
the
examiner
recommended
the
general
bargaining
order.
the
case
then
went
up
to
the
board,
the
board
adopted
the
general
bargaining
order,
it
went
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
enforced
and
refused
the
union's
request
for
a
direct
order
which
we
are
now
arguing
about
which
was
later
entered
but
on
the
first
time
up
the
district
of
columbia
rejected
the
union’s
petition,
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
then,
after
that
occurred,
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
with
this
court.
we
took
the
position
that
because
of
the
wording
used
in
the
opinion,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
telling
us
if
you
want
to
avoid
contempt,
you
had
better
agree
without
any
further
talking.
well,
when
the
court
--
when
this
court
denied
our
petition
for
cert,
we
then
took
the
interpretation
which
we
felt
we
had
to
under
the
laws.
we
interpret
the
law
that
the
general
bargaining
order
required
us
to
bargain
over
a
dues
collection
system
but
not
simply
to
walk
in
and
agree.
the
union
took
the
position
of
those
subsequent
negotiations
said,
no
porter
you
are
now
required
to
agree
and
we
don’t
have
to
talk
to
you
any
more
about
it.
you
are
required
to
agree
to
do
dues
checkoff
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
suggested
that
in
order
to
avoid
contempt.
the
court
could
not
see
how
we
could
avoid
agreeing.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
we
went
then
went
--
gone
in
the
position
of
the
verge
of
interpretations
of
this
original
bargaining
order.
the
union
then
asked
the
board
to
initiate
a
contempt
proceeding.
the
board's
regional
director
advised
the
parties
that
the
company
had
now
complied
with
the
bargaining
order
and
that
the
case
was
thereby
closed.
the
union
then
found
a
motion
for
clarification
with
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
the
first
time,
the
circuit
court
denied
the
motion
for
clarification
and
said,
we
think
contempt
is
a
proper
route
to
test
compliance.
then,
the
union
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
motion
asking
for
reconsideration
of
the
earlier
motion.
this
time,
the
court
of
appeals
came
up
with
an
opinion
of
course
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
and
that's
why
we
have
a
supplemental
order
before
this
court
and
instead
of
the
original
order.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion,
its
clarifying
opinion
told
the
board
that
we
feel
under
the
--
that
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
does
not
prohibit
the
board
for
entering
an
order
to
agree
to
a
substantive
contract
provision
and
that
the
board
can
either
order
agreement
directly
or
it
can
compel
a
concession
that
will
be
given
in
exchange
for
the
demanded
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
is
in
the
supplemental
order
issued
by
the
board
and
shown
mr.
justice
black
on
page
4
of
porter’s
brief
under
statement
of
the
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
it's
in
the
appendix
also.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it's
on
page
137
of
the
appendix,
supplemental
orders
first
on
left
hand
side
page
136.
a
general
bargaining
order
is
first
entered
and
at
the
top
of
the
right
hand
page
137,
the
order
is
grant
to
the
union
a
contract
clause
providing
for
the
checkoff
of
union
dues.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
this
case
presents
to
the
board
or
presents
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
the
35-year
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
a
situation
in
which
the
board
has
ordered
one
party
to
agree
to
a
contract
term.
we
submit
that
this
order
violates
both
the
specific
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
wording
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
as
well
as
the
basic
premise
of
freedom
of
contract
as
contained
and
has
been
recognized
to
exist
in
section
8
(d).
this
section
of
the
act
provides
that
the
obligation
to
bargaining
good
faith
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession
and
of
course
this
court
in
both
the
american
national
insurance
case
and
the
insurance
agents
case
recognized
section
8
(d)
as
prohibiting
the
board
from
either
directly
or
indirectly,
compelling
concessions
or
from
otherwise
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
terms
that
collective-bargaining
agreements.
it's
true
that
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
permits
the
board
to
enter
such
remedial
orders
such
affirmative
orders
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
we
recognized
the
distinction
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
board
and
the
union
are
now
arguing
that
section
8
(d)
itself
does
not
directly
relate
by
express
terms
to
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
but
it
certainly
expresses
a
fundamental
policy
of
the
act
that
of
freedom
of
contract.
this
court
and
the
cases
i
cited
a
moment
ago
recognized
that
that
--
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
was
well
cited
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
insurance
agents
case
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
keep
the
board
from
either
directly
or
indirectly
compelling
agreements.
we
contend
that
the
supplemental
order
is
in
clear
derogation
in
violation
of
this
fundamental
policy
and
it’s
interesting
that
the
board
until
a
supplemental
order
took
exactly
the
same
position.
the
board
did
not
enter
even
though
union
demanded
that
the
board
did
not
enter
a
direct
order
to
agree
initially.
and
in
fact,
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
cert
the
first
time
in
this
court,
the
board
took
the
position
that
if
bargaining
order
did
not
violate
section
8
(d)
that
it
merely
orders
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
they
pointed
out
specifically
that
they
had
not
violated
section
8
(d).
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
we
cited
in
our
brief
--
that
would
be
on
page
15
of
the
porter
brief
mr.
justice
stewart.
right
inside
of
a
page
and
this
was
an
answer
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
first
time
and
the
board
pointed
out
there
that
the
original
order
did
not
violate
the
provisions
of
8
(d)
if
i
may
address
one
moment.
you'll
recall
that
we
were
arguing
that
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
to
cause
us
to
agree
and
the
board
points
out
that
the
original
order
did
not
violate
section
8
(d),
that
a
statutory
duty
to
bargain
does
not
require
to
making
of
a
concession.
the
board's
order
merely
directs
the
company
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
i
doubt
if
the
briefs
would
be
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
original
board
--
order
of
the
board
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
original
order
is
on
page
55.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
they
adopted
the
recommended
orders.
i
should
refer
you
to
page
52
for
the
examiner's
recommended
order.
the
board
merely
having
adopted
that
and
the
recommended
order
was
a
negative
and
an
affirmative
cease
and
desist
from
refusing
the
bargain
in
good
faith
and
affirmatively
bargain.
and
of
course
i
point
out
that
the
board's
regional
director
subsequent
to
this
original
bargaining
order
found
that
the
company
had
bargained.
this
is
when
the
company
came
to
the
union
and
said,
we
are
ready
to
bargain
now
over
a
dues
collection
system
and
the
union
took
the
position.
no,
you
are
required
merely
to
agree
now
and
then
when
the
union
asked
the
board
to
initiate
contempt,
the
union
adv
--
pardon
me,
the
board
advised
the
parties
by
letter
that
the
company
had
complied
of
both
the
negative
and
the
affirmative
requirements
to
that
original
order
and
that
the
case
was
hereby
closed.
now,
i
point
this
out
very
frankly
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
now
before
this
court
except
that
the
union
and
the
board
in
their
briefs
argue
appropriateness.
they
say
very
little
i
suggest
about
the
statutory
power
or
what
we
contend
be
the
lack
of
statutory
power
but
it
do
argue
appropriateness
even
though
they
contempt,
we
haven't
raised
the
issue.
well,
i
submit
to
you
that
a
general
bargaining
order
must
be
appropriate
in
the
very
case
in
which
the
board
found
that
it
effectuated
the
desired
result
that
is
it
got
the
employer
to
bargain.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
that
is
the
issue
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that
is
the
issue,
we're
all
in
agreement.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that
is
--
i
think
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
that
is
the
specific
issue.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
if
i
may
to
the
approach
used
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
very
properly
recognized
that
freedom
of
contract
is
a
fundamental
policy
and
premise
of
the
act
and
they
agreed
that
remedies
which
impinge
on
it
are
not
to
be
lightly
undertaken.
but
they
then
pointed
out
under
that
section
10
(c)
the
board
is
to
balance
the
policies
and
this
is
to
try
to
move
forward
onto
all
policies.
they
then
cited
the
--
what
they
considered
to
be
an
equal
policy
and
that
is
a
policy
of
the
act
to
equalize
the
bargaining
power
of
an
employees
and
employers
by
assuring
the
right
of
workers
to
bargain
collectively.
the
court
of
appeals
then
proceeded
to
cite
such
alleged
facts
as
the
fact
that
the
dues
checkoff
provision
is
in
92%
of
industry
contracts,
the
dues
checkoff
is
likely
to
be
a
life
or
death
import
to
a
fledgling
union.
the
dues
checkoff
provision
and
ordering
evidence
is
only
a
minor
intrusion
on
freedom
of
contract.
they
even
cited
the
fact
that
the
union’s
nearest
office
was
85
miles
away
that
the
employees
were
scattered
over
a
wide
area.
the
court
concluded
that
the
collection
of
dues
without
dues
checkoff
provision
had
presented
the
union
with
a
substantial
problem
of
communication
in
transportation.
we
submit
that
this
approach
although
laudatory
in
the
balancing
of
the
policies
but
this
approach
of
looking
at
the
need
of
the
union
for
this
provision
and
in
saying
its
of
little
effect
to
the
company
and
of
course
it
has
been
cited
all
through
the
record
at
the
original
hearing.
the
company
said,
we're
not
objecting
as
a
matter
of
inconvenience
and
so
forth
cost.
i
submit
that
this
is
exactly
what
8
(d)
prohibits
that
8
(d)
and
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
8
(d),
the
congress
prohibited
the
board
from
policing
the
needs,
from
sitting
in
judgment
on
whether
one
party
should
have
had
the
provision
and
the
other
party
didn’t
have
good
enough
reason
for
denying
it.
in
fact,
i
also
suggest
that
this
area
of
whether
a
business
reason
is
needed
for
refusing
a
contract
demand
by
the
other
bargaining
party
is
part
of
the
issue
of
this
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
the
actual
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
i
do.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
i
think
it
has
to
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
very
reason
that
everybody
is
in
agreement
to
the
8
(d)
prohibits
the
board
from
using
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evidence
of
bad
faith.
well,
to
me
it
seems
illogical
to
say
this
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
once
bad
faith
is
found
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence
and
this
is
all
subjective
intent
that
then
the
board
can
order
agreement
on
the
very
same
contract
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
in
the
context
of
the
finding
of
bad
faith,
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
i
think
we're
all
in
agreement
that
on
the
finding
of
bad
faith
that
is
on
the
use
of
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evident
to
bad-faith
bargaining
that
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear
than
everybody
agrees
with
it.
it's
on
the
scope
of
the
remedy
which
is
where
we’re
running
into
our
problem
now.
it's
on
the
scope
of
the
remedy
and
of
course
to
us,
if
the
evil
to
be
cured
--
the
evil
that
congress
was
after
here
was
to
keep
the
board
from
intruding
into
the
collective-bargaining
process.
well,
to
prohibit
the
use
of
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evidence,
but
at
the
same
time
for
congress
to
have
permitted
an
order
to
agree
to
that
very
same
contract
provision.
this
doesn't
make
sense
it
seems
to
us.
now,
the
legislative
history
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
the
intent
of
congress
is
too
broad
for
that
we
submit.
it's
too
much
for
example
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
board
was
prohibited
from
directly
or
indirectly
sitting
in
judgment
for
example.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
just
i
cited
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
no,
it
was
not
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes
and
that
was
a
case
of
regulating
the
economic
weapons.
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
a
closer
analogy
of
the
insurance
agents’
case
of
this
one
is
merely
the
wording
in
your
opinion
which
of
course
we
rely
heavily
upon.
and
i
cite
--
i
must
give
credit
to
the
chief
justice
for
my
argument
on
this
point,
but
he
dissented.
the
chief
justice
dissented
in
the
ronald
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
happened
by
coincidence
via
dues
checkoff
case
also.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
there,
the
grant
or
refusal,
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
dues
checkoff
provision
is
in
effect
an
economic
weapon
in
the
sense
that
the
union
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision
is
there's
no
doubt
in
many
cases.
they
are
under
an
economic
pressure
but
as
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
ronald
case,
an
employer
with
his
employees
on
a
strike
is
harmed
even
more.
also,
we're
talking
in
effect
i
think
about
the
bargaining
tool
of
bargaining
tactic
granted
porter
did
not
say
that
the
union
in
this
case.
we
are
withholding
or
refusing
to
agree
the
dues
checkoff
because
we
wanted
to
trade
it
next
year,
but
the
more
a
union
would
demand
the
provision
like
this,
obviously,
the
more
the
employer
is
going
to
resist
to
the
point
of
getting
something
in
return
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
doesn't
present
any
particular
problem,
i
don't
think
it
present
any
particular
problem
for
me,
what
do
you
have
in
mind
specifically
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
donald
c.
winson
but
i
don't
believe
there
was
an
order,
i
don't
believe
the
order
went
beyond
a
restoration
type
remedy,
did
it
not?
mr.
donald
c.
winson
and
the
union
of
the
board
or
cites
that
as
a
“basis.”
this
case,
i
don’t
think
this
court
will
argue
beyond
our
brief.
this
case
certainly
goes
beyond
the
restoration
of
status
quo.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
no
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
reason
that
the
bad
faith
has
to
be
there
or
we
wouldn't
be
to
the
point
of
the
remedy
in
a
bargaining
case.
in
other
words,
in
8
(a)
5
case
except
for
a
mere
refusal
but
i
mean
that
of
course
is
bad
faith,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
where
the
parties
have
bargain
or
has
sat
down
and
mend
there
the
finding
of
an
8
(a)
5
violation,
then
that
has
to
be
premised
of
course
on
bad
faith.
so
we're
now
at
the
point
of
a
remedy
for
the
union
in
the
board
to
argue
here
that
there
is
a
line
that
can
be
drawn
by
this
court.
we
submit
is
it's
just
not
practical
to
talk
for
example
was
the
union
does
of
run-of-the-mill
cases
that
by
all
might,
they
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
kind
of
an
order
could
be
entered
in
a
run-of-the-mill
bargaining
cases.
who's
to
determine
what
is
the
run-of-the-mill
bargaining
case?
taking
the
court
of
appeals
words
they
say,
this
is
only
a
minor
intrusion.
who's
to
determine
whether
it's
a
minor
intrusion?
all
of
these
is
what
congress
told
the
board
to
stay
out
of
with
section
8
(a)
5.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
of
course
taking
the
last
part,
i
take
the
position
that
in
no
circumstances
can
a
party
be
ordered
to
agree.
but
to
take
your
question
you've
asked
me,
of
course
the
board
if
these
were
charged
and
if
the
complaint
was
issued
by
the
board
then
obviously
the
question
to
be
answer
by
the
examiner
at
that
point
by
the
board
would
be
did
the
employer
bargain
in
good
faith?
that
is
subjective
intent
and
i'm
sure
that
this
charge
wouldn't
have
been
filed
merely
on
a
refusal
in
nickel-wage
increase
at
least
i
don’t
think
so.
you'll
notice
for
example
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
merely
refusal
to
agree.
the
examiner
set
the
refusal
to
agree
was
to
frustrate
an
agreement
then
they
took
it
a
different
step.
it's
a
little
different
from
ronald
in
this
extent
you'll
recall.
but
in
the
hypothetical,
you're
asking
me
certainly
the
question
has
to
be
was
it
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
but
once
the
board
found
that
yes
the
employer
refuse
to
agree
to
a
nickel-wage
increase
in
bad
faith
in
the
sense
he
was
bargaining
in
bad
faith
and
there
must
have
some
other
reasons.
they
had
a
secret
motive
of
trying
to
get
rid
of
that
particular
union
president
or
business
agent.
in
other
words,
some
doctrines
were
discovered
in
some
extrinsic
evidence
find
that
the
employers
now
have
been
found
guilty
of
bad-faith
bargaining
in
violation
of
8
(a)
5.
but
we
submit
that
at
that
point,
the
board
cannot
order
the
company
to
agree
to
that
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it's
only
a
remedy
problem
where
the
court
of
appeals
distinguishes
and
says
that
it's
a
matter
that
8
(a)
5
is
relating
only
to
the
determination
issue
--
the
evidence
issue.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
oh!
yes,
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
the
position
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
my
position,
exactly.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
doesn't
go
that
far
because
the
8
(d)
policy
stands
on
its
way.
something
is
coming
in
here
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago
is
this,
this
business
reason
the
board
and
the
union
in
their
briefs.
the
board
on
its
opinion
in
support
of
a
supplemental
order
talked
in
terms
that
the
company
did
not
have
a
business
reason.
i
know
of
no
law
that
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
business
reason.
again,
i
cite
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissenting
opinion
to
say
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
you
mean
on
the
ronald
case?
on
the
ronald
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
i
think
your
reasoning
mr.
chief
justice
is
completely
applicable
here
and
that
is
the
question
of
holding
even
though
you
don't
have
a
business
reason.
you
just
don't
agree
to
the
provision
because
the
union
wants
it
so
badly
that
when
they
give
you
something
forth
maybe
not
this
year
but
the
following
year.
this
is
what
bargaining
is
all
about,
we
submit.
we
submit
this
is
what
bargaining.
it
has
to
do
with
here.
we
think
it's
redundant
to
say
that
the
board
can
order
a
party
to
agree
and
that
he
can
order
--
that
the
board
can
order
into
agree
and
order
to
effectuate
the
requirements
of
bargaining
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
true.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
there
are
middle
grounds
of
course
in
dues
collection
and
this
is
what
the
company
offered
to
discuss
with
the
board
after
the
original
or
with
the
union
after
the
original
board
order.
it
offered
to
discuss
a
method
--
a
satisfactory
methods
that
are
satisfactory
to
both
parties
for
the
collection
of
the
union
dues
because
there
are
other
methods
involved.
i
mean
there
could
be
other
ways
in
collecting
the
union
dues,
but
generally
speaking
in
this
country
in
labor
contracts,
i
would
agree
that
it
is
usually
either
a
checkoff
provision
or
there
isn't
a
checkoff
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
no
it
isn't.
that's
exactly
what
i
suppose
to
say.
this
is
only
one
provision
mr.
justice
brennan
and
it's
obviously
a
provision
that
can
be
traded.
you'll
recall
from
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
that
the
union
at
every
bargaining
meeting
in
fact
that
they've
already
involved
here
insistent
they
would
never
sign
a
contract
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
a
landmark
case
and
presents
threshold
issue
to
this
court
and
if
the
supplemental
order
is
permitted
to
stand
after
this
long
35-year
history
without
this
type
of
a
remedy
that
we're
going
to
have
a
new
scheme
of
bargaining.
we're
going
to
have
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
one
in
which
the
parties
go
as
far
as
they
can
over
the
bargaining
table
and
then
one
of
the
parties
usually
the
union,
of
course
will
come
to
the
board
and
say
that
the
company
failed
the
bargain
in
good
faith,
we
then
have
a
finding
of
bad
faith
argue
mr.
justice
brennan
on
your
hypothetical
again,
then
the
question
of
remedy.
now,
since
it's
been
a
finding
of
bad-faith
bargaining
there
may
be
primary
--
preliminary
issues
of
whether
it’s
a
run-of-the-mill
case
that
was
suggested
to
us
or
it
may
be
a
question
of
whether
it
would
be
a
minor
intrusion
or
so
forth,
that's
been
suggested
to
us.
but
in
any
event,
the
board
would
have
a
power
to
order
the
company
to
agree
to
the
very
contract
provision
which
the
union
could
not
obtain
at
the
bargaining
tables.
if
the
court
have
any
further
questions,
i
didn't
reserve
any
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
from
the
marshal
we
have
a
couple
of
minutes
left
here.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
thank
you
very
much
i'll
just
take
couple
of
those
minutes
if
i
may
to
answer
the
question
that
was
post
a
minute
ago,
the
record
does
show
that
the
union
adequately
insist
upon
a
dues
checkoff
provision
and
although
i
couldn't
quickly
find
the
record
reference
judge
miller
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
what
even
to
the
extent
that
the
counsel
for
the
board's
general
counsel
told
the
examiner
that
his
own
inquiry
showed
that
the
union
would
not
sign
a
contract
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
there
have
been
references
now
throughout
the
briefs
in
the
argument
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that’s
right
mr.
justice
black
and
the
company
was
found
to
a
bargain
of
bad
faith
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement.
incidentally,
that
raises
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
mandatory
subject
and
then
somebody
said
it
never
been
raise.
in
the
earlier
proceedings
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
argue
that
where
we
were
not
convinced
that
at
that
time
i'm
not
personally
not
convince
now
that
it
is
a
mandatory
subject.
but
obviously
it
was
not
something
to
be
raise
in
this
proceeding
before
this
court.
so
we
have
not
--
do
not
have
this
as
an
issue
right
now,
but
there
have
been
references
characterizing
this
case
in
a
number
in
different
ways
now.
as
we
mentioned
earlier,
the
union
in
its
brief
talks
of
this
that
this
remedy
that
they're
after
here
could
not
be
use
is
a
ronald
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
in
ordering
a
checkoff
is
only
a
minor
intrusion
on
agreement
contract.
now,
today,
it
said
that
this
is
a
unique
situation.
well,
as
judge
miller
in
his
dissenting
opinion
initially
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
never
seen
case
so
barren
of
support
for
the
bad
faith
finding
found
by
the
examiner
and
adopted
by
the
board.
now,
we're
not
here
to
argue
the
facts
obviously
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
for
anybody
to
say
this
case
is
unique
or
this
or
that
case
is
where
the
miller,
that’s
always
a
decision
that
has
to
be
made
their
people
when
you
disagree.
congress
in
its
wisdom
did
not,
and
nobody
has
cited
any
authority
that
congress
empower
the
board
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
characterizing
cases
whether
it
can
order
agreement
or
whether
it
couldn’t.
counsel
for
the
board
argued
today
when
asked
the
question,
well,
where
do
we
draw
the
line,
where
do
you
suggest
we
draw
the
line?
he
said
this
about
the
present
case
where
he
says
that
it's
within
the
imaginary
line.
here,
there
was
a
bargaining
in
bad
faith.
well,
there's
a
bargaining
in
bad
faith
in
every
case
you
don't
approach
the
remedy.
the
question
of
8
(a)
5
remedy
unless
there's
bad
faith
bargaining.
he
said
there
was
no
business
or
legitimate
reason.
i
know
of
no
law
i
don’t
think
there's
law
right
now
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
have
a
business
reason.
i
don't
think
our
law
has
approach
that
point
and
i
suggest
to
that
is
probably
an
important
issue
now
or
an
important
consideration
in
this
case
whether
business
reasons
are
or
not
needed.
the
third
thing,
he
said
was
a
checkoff
provision
as
cut-and-dry.
well,
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
a
checkoff
is
cut-and
dry.
it
can
affect
other
provisions,
it
can
affect
the
wage
provisions
for
example
obviously
if
the
union
wants
the
checkoff
provision
badly
enough,
they're
going
to
give
up
2
cents
an
hour
to
get
it
or
3
cents
what
have
you.
so
i
suggest
that
these
two
considerations
that
have
been
brought
forth
today
are
exactly
in
the
character
of
the
congress
told
the
board
to
stay
away
from
in
8
(a)
5
and
that
is
a
sitting
in
judgment
on
whether
the
case
is
unique,
whether
it’s
cu-and-dry,
whether
there
were
good
reasons
for
refusing
the
provision.
i
suggest
this,
i
would
conclude
with
the
point
from
the
chamber’s
brief
of
footnote.
it
pointed
out
that
be
sitting
here
today
that
this
question
of
board
intrusion
in
the
bargaining
process
did
not
come
anew
in
1947.
i'm
referred
to
the
legislative
history
back
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
1935
and
the
is
footnote
on
page
5
of
the
chamber's
brief
where
senator
wolf,
chairman
of
the
committee
in
education
and
labor
said
that
nothing
in
this
bill
allows
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
to
fix
wages,
regulates
rates
of
pay
and
so
forth.
there
is
nothing
in
this
bill
that
compels
any
employer
to
make
any
agreement
about
wages,
hours,
employment
or
working
conditions.
i
merely
suggest
that
this
treat
of
freedom
of
contract
in
the
basic
premise
throughout
the
act
section
8
(d)
is
the
focal
point
by
which
is
brought
forth
but
this
basic
premise
is
there
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deny
it.
the
board
and
the
union
in
our
brief
do
not
deny.
instead,
they
say
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
agree
whenever
the
intrusion
of
freedom
contract
is
only
minor.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
short
certiorari
to
review
a
per
curiam
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
which
enforce
a
supplemental
order
of
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board's
order
was
entered
that
gives
the
petitioner
h.
k.
porter
company
supposedly
as
a
remedy
for
bad-faith
bargaining
in
violation
of
section
885
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
more
specifically,
the
company
was
found
to
have
refused
to
agree
to
a
union's
demand
for
a
dues
checkoff
provision
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement
with
the
union.
the
board
supplemental
order
which
is
the
focal
point
of
this
controversy
before
this
court
requires
the
company
to
“grant
to
the
union
a
contract
clause
providing
for
the
checkoff
of
union
dues.”
the
very
precise,
very
clear
cut
issue
now
presented
is
whether
the
board
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
the
power
to
order
a
party
to
agree
to
a
substantive
provision
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
company
of
course
takes
position
that
board
has
not
has
such
power.
the
board
now
says
that
it
has
the
power
to
order
agreement
to
a
substantive
provision.
the
bargaining
that's
actually
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
substantive
provision
mr.
justice
black
was
a
dues
checkoff
provision
--
a
provision
of
course
and
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
by
which
the
company
pays
and
assist
the
union
in
the
collection
of
dues
by
deducting
the
due
--
union
dues
from
the
employees’
wages
and
then
transmits
them
to
the
union.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
way
the
case
worked
out
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
it
actually
worked
that
way.
the
court
of
appeals
is
actually
if
i
may
say
so
the
instigator
of
the
remedy
here
is
as
to
what
has
occurred.
this
case
went
through
the
examiner.
the
examiner
recommended
the
general
bargaining
order.
the
case
then
went
up
to
the
board,
the
board
adopted
the
general
bargaining
order,
it
went
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
enforced
and
refused
the
union's
request
for
a
direct
order
which
we
are
now
arguing
about
which
was
later
entered
but
on
the
first
time
up
the
district
of
columbia
rejected
the
union’s
petition,
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
then,
after
that
occurred,
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
with
this
court.
we
took
the
position
that
because
of
the
wording
used
in
the
opinion,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
telling
us
if
you
want
to
avoid
contempt,
you
had
better
agree
without
any
further
talking.
well,
when
the
court
--
when
this
court
denied
our
petition
for
cert,
we
then
took
the
interpretation
which
we
felt
we
had
to
under
the
laws.
we
interpret
the
law
that
the
general
bargaining
order
required
us
to
bargain
over
a
dues
collection
system
but
not
simply
to
walk
in
and
agree.
the
union
took
the
position
of
those
subsequent
negotiations
said,
no
porter
you
are
now
required
to
agree
and
we
don’t
have
to
talk
to
you
any
more
about
it.
you
are
required
to
agree
to
do
dues
checkoff
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
suggested
that
in
order
to
avoid
contempt.
the
court
could
not
see
how
we
could
avoid
agreeing.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
we
went
then
went
--
gone
in
the
position
of
the
verge
of
interpretations
of
this
original
bargaining
order.
the
union
then
asked
the
board
to
initiate
a
contempt
proceeding.
the
board's
regional
director
advised
the
parties
that
the
company
had
now
complied
with
the
bargaining
order
and
that
the
case
was
thereby
closed.
the
union
then
found
a
motion
for
clarification
with
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court.
the
first
time,
the
circuit
court
denied
the
motion
for
clarification
and
said,
we
think
contempt
is
a
proper
route
to
test
compliance.
then,
the
union
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
motion
asking
for
reconsideration
of
the
earlier
motion.
this
time,
the
court
of
appeals
came
up
with
an
opinion
of
course
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
and
that's
why
we
have
a
supplemental
order
before
this
court
and
instead
of
the
original
order.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
second
opinion,
its
clarifying
opinion
told
the
board
that
we
feel
under
the
--
that
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
does
not
prohibit
the
board
for
entering
an
order
to
agree
to
a
substantive
contract
provision
and
that
the
board
can
either
order
agreement
directly
or
it
can
compel
a
concession
that
will
be
given
in
exchange
for
the
demanded
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
is
in
the
supplemental
order
issued
by
the
board
and
shown
mr.
justice
black
on
page
4
of
porter’s
brief
under
statement
of
the
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
it's
in
the
appendix
also.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it's
on
page
137
of
the
appendix,
supplemental
orders
first
on
left
hand
side
page
136.
a
general
bargaining
order
is
first
entered
and
at
the
top
of
the
right
hand
page
137,
the
order
is
grant
to
the
union
a
contract
clause
providing
for
the
checkoff
of
union
dues.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
this
case
presents
to
the
board
or
presents
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
the
35-year
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
a
situation
in
which
the
board
has
ordered
one
party
to
agree
to
a
contract
term.
we
submit
that
this
order
violates
both
the
specific
intent
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
wording
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
as
well
as
the
basic
premise
of
freedom
of
contract
as
contained
and
has
been
recognized
to
exist
in
section
8
(d).
this
section
of
the
act
provides
that
the
obligation
to
bargaining
good
faith
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
a
concession
and
of
course
this
court
in
both
the
american
national
insurance
case
and
the
insurance
agents
case
recognized
section
8
(d)
as
prohibiting
the
board
from
either
directly
or
indirectly,
compelling
concessions
or
from
otherwise
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
terms
that
collective-bargaining
agreements.
it's
true
that
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
permits
the
board
to
enter
such
remedial
orders
such
affirmative
orders
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
we
recognized
the
distinction
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
board
and
the
union
are
now
arguing
that
section
8
(d)
itself
does
not
directly
relate
by
express
terms
to
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
but
it
certainly
expresses
a
fundamental
policy
of
the
act
that
of
freedom
of
contract.
this
court
and
the
cases
i
cited
a
moment
ago
recognized
that
that
--
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
was
well
cited
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
insurance
agents
case
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
keep
the
board
from
either
directly
or
indirectly
compelling
agreements.
we
contend
that
the
supplemental
order
is
in
clear
derogation
in
violation
of
this
fundamental
policy
and
it’s
interesting
that
the
board
until
a
supplemental
order
took
exactly
the
same
position.
the
board
did
not
enter
even
though
union
demanded
that
the
board
did
not
enter
a
direct
order
to
agree
initially.
and
in
fact,
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
cert
the
first
time
in
this
court,
the
board
took
the
position
that
if
bargaining
order
did
not
violate
section
8
(d)
that
it
merely
orders
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
they
pointed
out
specifically
that
they
had
not
violated
section
8
(d).
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
we
cited
in
our
brief
--
that
would
be
on
page
15
of
the
porter
brief
mr.
justice
stewart.
right
inside
of
a
page
and
this
was
an
answer
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
the
first
time
and
the
board
pointed
out
there
that
the
original
order
did
not
violate
the
provisions
of
8
(d)
if
i
may
address
one
moment.
you'll
recall
that
we
were
arguing
that
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
to
cause
us
to
agree
and
the
board
points
out
that
the
original
order
did
not
violate
section
8
(d),
that
a
statutory
duty
to
bargain
does
not
require
to
making
of
a
concession.
the
board's
order
merely
directs
the
company
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
i
doubt
if
the
briefs
would
be
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
original
board
--
order
of
the
board
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
the
original
order
is
on
page
55.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
they
adopted
the
recommended
orders.
i
should
refer
you
to
page
52
for
the
examiner's
recommended
order.
the
board
merely
having
adopted
that
and
the
recommended
order
was
a
negative
and
an
affirmative
cease
and
desist
from
refusing
the
bargain
in
good
faith
and
affirmatively
bargain.
and
of
course
i
point
out
that
the
board's
regional
director
subsequent
to
this
original
bargaining
order
found
that
the
company
had
bargained.
this
is
when
the
company
came
to
the
union
and
said,
we
are
ready
to
bargain
now
over
a
dues
collection
system
and
the
union
took
the
position.
no,
you
are
required
merely
to
agree
now
and
then
when
the
union
asked
the
board
to
initiate
contempt,
the
union
adv
--
pardon
me,
the
board
advised
the
parties
by
letter
that
the
company
had
complied
of
both
the
negative
and
the
affirmative
requirements
to
that
original
order
and
that
the
case
was
hereby
closed.
now,
i
point
this
out
very
frankly
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
now
before
this
court
except
that
the
union
and
the
board
in
their
briefs
argue
appropriateness.
they
say
very
little
i
suggest
about
the
statutory
power
or
what
we
contend
be
the
lack
of
statutory
power
but
it
do
argue
appropriateness
even
though
they
contempt,
we
haven't
raised
the
issue.
well,
i
submit
to
you
that
a
general
bargaining
order
must
be
appropriate
in
the
very
case
in
which
the
board
found
that
it
effectuated
the
desired
result
that
is
it
got
the
employer
to
bargain.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
that
is
the
issue
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that
is
the
issue,
we're
all
in
agreement.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that
is
--
i
think
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
that
is
the
specific
issue.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
if
i
may
to
the
approach
used
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
very
properly
recognized
that
freedom
of
contract
is
a
fundamental
policy
and
premise
of
the
act
and
they
agreed
that
remedies
which
impinge
on
it
are
not
to
be
lightly
undertaken.
but
they
then
pointed
out
under
that
section
10
(c)
the
board
is
to
balance
the
policies
and
this
is
to
try
to
move
forward
onto
all
policies.
they
then
cited
the
--
what
they
considered
to
be
an
equal
policy
and
that
is
a
policy
of
the
act
to
equalize
the
bargaining
power
of
an
employees
and
employers
by
assuring
the
right
of
workers
to
bargain
collectively.
the
court
of
appeals
then
proceeded
to
cite
such
alleged
facts
as
the
fact
that
the
dues
checkoff
provision
is
in
92%
of
industry
contracts,
the
dues
checkoff
is
likely
to
be
a
life
or
death
import
to
a
fledgling
union.
the
dues
checkoff
provision
and
ordering
evidence
is
only
a
minor
intrusion
on
freedom
of
contract.
they
even
cited
the
fact
that
the
union’s
nearest
office
was
85
miles
away
that
the
employees
were
scattered
over
a
wide
area.
the
court
concluded
that
the
collection
of
dues
without
dues
checkoff
provision
had
presented
the
union
with
a
substantial
problem
of
communication
in
transportation.
we
submit
that
this
approach
although
laudatory
in
the
balancing
of
the
policies
but
this
approach
of
looking
at
the
need
of
the
union
for
this
provision
and
in
saying
its
of
little
effect
to
the
company
and
of
course
it
has
been
cited
all
through
the
record
at
the
original
hearing.
the
company
said,
we're
not
objecting
as
a
matter
of
inconvenience
and
so
forth
cost.
i
submit
that
this
is
exactly
what
8
(d)
prohibits
that
8
(d)
and
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
8
(d),
the
congress
prohibited
the
board
from
policing
the
needs,
from
sitting
in
judgment
on
whether
one
party
should
have
had
the
provision
and
the
other
party
didn’t
have
good
enough
reason
for
denying
it.
in
fact,
i
also
suggest
that
this
area
of
whether
a
business
reason
is
needed
for
refusing
a
contract
demand
by
the
other
bargaining
party
is
part
of
the
issue
of
this
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
the
actual
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
i
do.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
i
think
it
has
to
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
very
reason
that
everybody
is
in
agreement
to
the
8
(d)
prohibits
the
board
from
using
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evidence
of
bad
faith.
well,
to
me
it
seems
illogical
to
say
this
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
once
bad
faith
is
found
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence
and
this
is
all
subjective
intent
that
then
the
board
can
order
agreement
on
the
very
same
contract
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
in
the
context
of
the
finding
of
bad
faith,
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes,
i
think
we're
all
in
agreement
that
on
the
finding
of
bad
faith
that
is
on
the
use
of
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evident
to
bad-faith
bargaining
that
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear
than
everybody
agrees
with
it.
it's
on
the
scope
of
the
remedy
which
is
where
we’re
running
into
our
problem
now.
it's
on
the
scope
of
the
remedy
and
of
course
to
us,
if
the
evil
to
be
cured
--
the
evil
that
congress
was
after
here
was
to
keep
the
board
from
intruding
into
the
collective-bargaining
process.
well,
to
prohibit
the
use
of
a
refusal
to
agree
as
evidence,
but
at
the
same
time
for
congress
to
have
permitted
an
order
to
agree
to
that
very
same
contract
provision.
this
doesn't
make
sense
it
seems
to
us.
now,
the
legislative
history
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
the
intent
of
congress
is
too
broad
for
that
we
submit.
it's
too
much
for
example
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
board
was
prohibited
from
directly
or
indirectly
sitting
in
judgment
for
example.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
just
i
cited
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
no,
it
was
not
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
yes
and
that
was
a
case
of
regulating
the
economic
weapons.
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
a
closer
analogy
of
the
insurance
agents’
case
of
this
one
is
merely
the
wording
in
your
opinion
which
of
course
we
rely
heavily
upon.
and
i
cite
--
i
must
give
credit
to
the
chief
justice
for
my
argument
on
this
point,
but
he
dissented.
the
chief
justice
dissented
in
the
ronald
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
happened
by
coincidence
via
dues
checkoff
case
also.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
there,
the
grant
or
refusal,
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
dues
checkoff
provision
is
in
effect
an
economic
weapon
in
the
sense
that
the
union
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision
is
there's
no
doubt
in
many
cases.
they
are
under
an
economic
pressure
but
as
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
ronald
case,
an
employer
with
his
employees
on
a
strike
is
harmed
even
more.
also,
we're
talking
in
effect
i
think
about
the
bargaining
tool
of
bargaining
tactic
granted
porter
did
not
say
that
the
union
in
this
case.
we
are
withholding
or
refusing
to
agree
the
dues
checkoff
because
we
wanted
to
trade
it
next
year,
but
the
more
a
union
would
demand
the
provision
like
this,
obviously,
the
more
the
employer
is
going
to
resist
to
the
point
of
getting
something
in
return
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
doesn't
present
any
particular
problem,
i
don't
think
it
present
any
particular
problem
for
me,
what
do
you
have
in
mind
specifically
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
donald
c.
winson
but
i
don't
believe
there
was
an
order,
i
don't
believe
the
order
went
beyond
a
restoration
type
remedy,
did
it
not?
mr.
donald
c.
winson
and
the
union
of
the
board
or
cites
that
as
a
“basis.”
this
case,
i
don’t
think
this
court
will
argue
beyond
our
brief.
this
case
certainly
goes
beyond
the
restoration
of
status
quo.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
no
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
reason
that
the
bad
faith
has
to
be
there
or
we
wouldn't
be
to
the
point
of
the
remedy
in
a
bargaining
case.
in
other
words,
in
8
(a)
5
case
except
for
a
mere
refusal
but
i
mean
that
of
course
is
bad
faith,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
where
the
parties
have
bargain
or
has
sat
down
and
mend
there
the
finding
of
an
8
(a)
5
violation,
then
that
has
to
be
premised
of
course
on
bad
faith.
so
we're
now
at
the
point
of
a
remedy
for
the
union
in
the
board
to
argue
here
that
there
is
a
line
that
can
be
drawn
by
this
court.
we
submit
is
it's
just
not
practical
to
talk
for
example
was
the
union
does
of
run-of-the-mill
cases
that
by
all
might,
they
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
kind
of
an
order
could
be
entered
in
a
run-of-the-mill
bargaining
cases.
who's
to
determine
what
is
the
run-of-the-mill
bargaining
case?
taking
the
court
of
appeals
words
they
say,
this
is
only
a
minor
intrusion.
who's
to
determine
whether
it's
a
minor
intrusion?
all
of
these
is
what
congress
told
the
board
to
stay
out
of
with
section
8
(a)
5.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
of
course
taking
the
last
part,
i
take
the
position
that
in
no
circumstances
can
a
party
be
ordered
to
agree.
but
to
take
your
question
you've
asked
me,
of
course
the
board
if
these
were
charged
and
if
the
complaint
was
issued
by
the
board
then
obviously
the
question
to
be
answer
by
the
examiner
at
that
point
by
the
board
would
be
did
the
employer
bargain
in
good
faith?
that
is
subjective
intent
and
i'm
sure
that
this
charge
wouldn't
have
been
filed
merely
on
a
refusal
in
nickel-wage
increase
at
least
i
don’t
think
so.
you'll
notice
for
example
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
merely
refusal
to
agree.
the
examiner
set
the
refusal
to
agree
was
to
frustrate
an
agreement
then
they
took
it
a
different
step.
it's
a
little
different
from
ronald
in
this
extent
you'll
recall.
but
in
the
hypothetical,
you're
asking
me
certainly
the
question
has
to
be
was
it
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
but
once
the
board
found
that
yes
the
employer
refuse
to
agree
to
a
nickel-wage
increase
in
bad
faith
in
the
sense
he
was
bargaining
in
bad
faith
and
there
must
have
some
other
reasons.
they
had
a
secret
motive
of
trying
to
get
rid
of
that
particular
union
president
or
business
agent.
in
other
words,
some
doctrines
were
discovered
in
some
extrinsic
evidence
find
that
the
employers
now
have
been
found
guilty
of
bad-faith
bargaining
in
violation
of
8
(a)
5.
but
we
submit
that
at
that
point,
the
board
cannot
order
the
company
to
agree
to
that
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it's
only
a
remedy
problem
where
the
court
of
appeals
distinguishes
and
says
that
it's
a
matter
that
8
(a)
5
is
relating
only
to
the
determination
issue
--
the
evidence
issue.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
oh!
yes,
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
the
position
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
my
position,
exactly.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
it
doesn't
go
that
far
because
the
8
(d)
policy
stands
on
its
way.
something
is
coming
in
here
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago
is
this,
this
business
reason
the
board
and
the
union
in
their
briefs.
the
board
on
its
opinion
in
support
of
a
supplemental
order
talked
in
terms
that
the
company
did
not
have
a
business
reason.
i
know
of
no
law
that
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
business
reason.
again,
i
cite
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissenting
opinion
to
say
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
you
mean
on
the
ronald
case?
on
the
ronald
case.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
well,
i
think
your
reasoning
mr.
chief
justice
is
completely
applicable
here
and
that
is
the
question
of
holding
even
though
you
don't
have
a
business
reason.
you
just
don't
agree
to
the
provision
because
the
union
wants
it
so
badly
that
when
they
give
you
something
forth
maybe
not
this
year
but
the
following
year.
this
is
what
bargaining
is
all
about,
we
submit.
we
submit
this
is
what
bargaining.
it
has
to
do
with
here.
we
think
it's
redundant
to
say
that
the
board
can
order
a
party
to
agree
and
that
he
can
order
--
that
the
board
can
order
into
agree
and
order
to
effectuate
the
requirements
of
bargaining
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that's
true.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
there
are
middle
grounds
of
course
in
dues
collection
and
this
is
what
the
company
offered
to
discuss
with
the
board
after
the
original
or
with
the
union
after
the
original
board
order.
it
offered
to
discuss
a
method
--
a
satisfactory
methods
that
are
satisfactory
to
both
parties
for
the
collection
of
the
union
dues
because
there
are
other
methods
involved.
i
mean
there
could
be
other
ways
in
collecting
the
union
dues,
but
generally
speaking
in
this
country
in
labor
contracts,
i
would
agree
that
it
is
usually
either
a
checkoff
provision
or
there
isn't
a
checkoff
provision.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
no
it
isn't.
that's
exactly
what
i
suppose
to
say.
this
is
only
one
provision
mr.
justice
brennan
and
it's
obviously
a
provision
that
can
be
traded.
you'll
recall
from
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
that
the
union
at
every
bargaining
meeting
in
fact
that
they've
already
involved
here
insistent
they
would
never
sign
a
contract
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
we
submit
that
this
case
is
a
landmark
case
and
presents
threshold
issue
to
this
court
and
if
the
supplemental
order
is
permitted
to
stand
after
this
long
35-year
history
without
this
type
of
a
remedy
that
we're
going
to
have
a
new
scheme
of
bargaining.
we're
going
to
have
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
one
in
which
the
parties
go
as
far
as
they
can
over
the
bargaining
table
and
then
one
of
the
parties
usually
the
union,
of
course
will
come
to
the
board
and
say
that
the
company
failed
the
bargain
in
good
faith,
we
then
have
a
finding
of
bad
faith
argue
mr.
justice
brennan
on
your
hypothetical
again,
then
the
question
of
remedy.
now,
since
it's
been
a
finding
of
bad-faith
bargaining
there
may
be
primary
--
preliminary
issues
of
whether
it’s
a
run-of-the-mill
case
that
was
suggested
to
us
or
it
may
be
a
question
of
whether
it
would
be
a
minor
intrusion
or
so
forth,
that's
been
suggested
to
us.
but
in
any
event,
the
board
would
have
a
power
to
order
the
company
to
agree
to
the
very
contract
provision
which
the
union
could
not
obtain
at
the
bargaining
tables.
if
the
court
have
any
further
questions,
i
didn't
reserve
any
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
from
the
marshal
we
have
a
couple
of
minutes
left
here.
mr.
donald
c.
winson
thank
you
very
much
i'll
just
take
couple
of
those
minutes
if
i
may
to
answer
the
question
that
was
post
a
minute
ago,
the
record
does
show
that
the
union
adequately
insist
upon
a
dues
checkoff
provision
and
although
i
couldn't
quickly
find
the
record
reference
judge
miller
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
what
even
to
the
extent
that
the
counsel
for
the
board's
general
counsel
told
the
examiner
that
his
own
inquiry
showed
that
the
union
would
not
sign
a
contract
without
a
dues
checkoff
provision.
there
have
been
references
now
throughout
the
briefs
in
the
argument
--
mr.
donald
c.
winson
that’s
right
mr.
justice
black
and
the
company
was
found
to
a
bargain
of
bad
faith
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement.
incidentally,
that
raises
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
mandatory
subject
and
then
somebody
said
it
never
been
raise.
in
the
earlier
proceedings
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
argue
that
where
we
were
not
convinced
that
at
that
time
i'm
not
personally
not
convince
now
that
it
is
a
mandatory
subject.
but
obviously
it
was
not
something
to
be
raise
in
this
proceeding
before
this
court.
so
we
have
not
--
do
not
have
this
as
an
issue
right
now,
but
there
have
been
references
characterizing
this
case
in
a
number
in
different
ways
now.
as
we
mentioned
earlier,
the
union
in
its
brief
talks
of
this
that
this
remedy
that
they're
after
here
could
not
be
use
is
a
ronald
case.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
in
ordering
a
checkoff
is
only
a
minor
intrusion
on
agreement
contract.
now,
today,
it
said
that
this
is
a
unique
situation.
well,
as
judge
miller
in
his
dissenting
opinion
initially
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
never
seen
case
so
barren
of
support
for
the
bad
faith
finding
found
by
the
examiner
and
adopted
by
the
board.
now,
we're
not
here
to
argue
the
facts
obviously
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
for
anybody
to
say
this
case
is
unique
or
this
or
that
case
is
where
the
miller,
that’s
always
a
decision
that
has
to
be
made
their
people
when
you
disagree.
congress
in
its
wisdom
did
not,
and
nobody
has
cited
any
authority
that
congress
empower
the
board
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
characterizing
cases
whether
it
can
order
agreement
or
whether
it
couldn’t.
counsel
for
the
board
argued
today
when
asked
the
question,
well,
where
do
we
draw
the
line,
where
do
you
suggest
we
draw
the
line?
he
said
this
about
the
present
case
where
he
says
that
it's
within
the
imaginary
line.
here,
there
was
a
bargaining
in
bad
faith.
well,
there's
a
bargaining
in
bad
faith
in
every
case
you
don't
approach
the
remedy.
the
question
of
8
(a)
5
remedy
unless
there's
bad
faith
bargaining.
he
said
there
was
no
business
or
legitimate
reason.
i
know
of
no
law
i
don’t
think
there's
law
right
now
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
have
a
business
reason.
i
don't
think
our
law
has
approach
that
point
and
i
suggest
to
that
is
probably
an
important
issue
now
or
an
important
consideration
in
this
case
whether
business
reasons
are
or
not
needed.
the
third
thing,
he
said
was
a
checkoff
provision
as
cut-and-dry.
well,
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
a
checkoff
is
cut-and
dry.
it
can
affect
other
provisions,
it
can
affect
the
wage
provisions
for
example
obviously
if
the
union
wants
the
checkoff
provision
badly
enough,
they're
going
to
give
up
2
cents
an
hour
to
get
it
or
3
cents
what
have
you.
so
i
suggest
that
these
two
considerations
that
have
been
brought
forth
today
are
exactly
in
the
character
of
the
congress
told
the
board
to
stay
away
from
in
8
(a)
5
and
that
is
a
sitting
in
judgment
on
whether
the
case
is
unique,
whether
it’s
cu-and-dry,
whether
there
were
good
reasons
for
refusing
the
provision.
i
suggest
this,
i
would
conclude
with
the
point
from
the
chamber’s
brief
of
footnote.
it
pointed
out
that
be
sitting
here
today
that
this
question
of
board
intrusion
in
the
bargaining
process
did
not
come
anew
in
1947.
i'm
referred
to
the
legislative
history
back
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
1935
and
the
is
footnote
on
page
5
of
the
chamber's
brief
where
senator
wolf,
chairman
of
the
committee
in
education
and
labor
said
that
nothing
in
this
bill
allows
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
to
fix
wages,
regulates
rates
of
pay
and
so
forth.
there
is
nothing
in
this
bill
that
compels
any
employer
to
make
any
agreement
about
wages,
hours,
employment
or
working
conditions.
i
merely
suggest
that
this
treat
of
freedom
of
contract
in
the
basic
premise
throughout
the
act
section
8
(d)
is
the
focal
point
by
which
is
brought
forth
but
this
basic
premise
is
there
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deny
it.
the
board
and
the
union
in
our
brief
do
not
deny.
instead,
they
say
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
agree
whenever
the
intrusion
of
freedom
contract
is
only
minor.
thank
you.
