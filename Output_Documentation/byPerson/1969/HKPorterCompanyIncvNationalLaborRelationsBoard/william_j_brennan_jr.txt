justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
winson
i
gather
that
the
board
found
here
that
porter
had
taken
a
bad
faith
or
otherwise
impermissible
bargaining
position,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
did
so
fine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
understand
the
board's
argument
to
be
that
8
(d),
it
doesn't
permit
a
party
to
refuse
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
a
reason
which
violates
the
statute,
do
you
take
a
different
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
you
take
the
position
that
8
(d)
protection
with
regard
to
good
or
bad
faith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d)
which
indicates
the
congress
dealt
with
its
application
in
the
context
of
a
finding
of
bad
faith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
insurance
agents
didn't
involve
the
situation
like
this
whether
is
a
finding
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
actually
was
conduct
of
the
union,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
support
taxes,
any
support
for
the
--
or
is
there
any
problem
fuel
up,
to
put
it
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
an
instance
wasnt
it
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
an
employer
which
was
in
violation
of
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it
didn't
try.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
winson.
do
you
--
perhaps
i'm
only
repeating
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier.
i
gather
your
position
is
that
in
the
application
of
8
(d),
it's
immaterial
whether
the
employer’s
conduct
was
in
good
or
bad
faith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
even
though
it's
only
a
remedy
problem,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
your
position
is
that
the
language
of
8
(d)
that
such
obligation
does
not
compel
either
party
to
agree
to
a
proposal
or
require
the
making
of
the
concession
that
that
language
operates
as
a
limitation
upon
any
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
basic
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
all
whether
the
position
that
the
company
has
taken
in
bargaining
is
a
good
faith,
bad
faith,
one
or
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
10
(c)
may
be
a
broad
power
to
the
board
to
address
grievances
but
it
doesn't
a
10
(c)
however
broad
doesn’t
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
i
take
it
it's
one
thing
mr.
winson
about
the
issue
of
checkoff
is
either
there
will
be
or
there
won't
be
checkoff
it’s
not
to
compromise
that
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
other
any
middle
grounds
of
whether
the
will
it
won't
be
a
checkoff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
only
provision
of
collective-bargaining
contract
it's
either
or
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
cohen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
ever
been
an
order
like
this
requiring
agreement
of
the
insertion
of
a
particular
provision
in
a
collective-bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
good
reason
why
it's
never
been
here
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
anyway
mr.
cohen,
really
isn't
your
position
that
no
matter
how
intransitive
an
employer
may
be,
all
that
can
happen
is
an
order
to
bargain
collectively
may
be
met?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
--
well,
some
order
of
that
kind
but
no
remedy
in
any
event
goes
far
as
require
the
employer
to
execute
a
particular
provision
or
particular
agreement
is
within
the
power
the
board
to
make.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
if
there
are
if
an
employer
simply
--
is
the
kind
that
mr.
justice
black
suggest
and
then
you
get
that
what
order
as
you
can
get
than
to
be
exist
in
his
intransigents
and
you
have
to
go
to
contempt
to
some
other
way
of
reaching
it,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
when
--
no
matter
how
bad
his
conduct
has
been,
your
position
is
that
in
any
event
the
board
has
absolutely
no
power
under
any
circumstances
to
require
and
agree
to
a
particular
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
all
these
by
force
of
the
language
of
8
(d)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
illegitimate
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
mr.
come
assuming
the
breath
that
you
argued
for
in
10
(c)
as
a
--
to
that
extent
at
least
some
qualification
on
the
prohibition
of
8
(d),
where
do
you
draw
the
line
on
this?
what's
the
point
in
which
you
say,
yes
10
(c)
goes
so
far
that
we
can
ignore
8
(d)
in
this
case,
what's
the
standard
by
which
is
to
be
decided
when
you
may
and
when
you
may
not
ignore
8
(d)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
like
most
of
this
is
rare,
what
do
you
mean
by
bad
faith
and
what
that
means?
do
you
mean
by
bad
faith
that
they
have
just
decided
they're
not
going
to
make
any
agreement
and
they
are
offering
the
excuses
to
keep
on
doing
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
come
surely
the
very
basic
premise
of
our
whole
labor
relations
instruction
is
that
it
regulated
to
see
that
the
parties
sit
down
to
bargaining
table
and
come
out
with
agreements
that
they
agreed
upon
and
that
government
shall
not
voice
agreements
upon
them.
that's
the
very
essential
of
our
own
protection.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
--
does
it
whether
under
the
guides
of
remedy
or
anything
else,
isn't
that
rather
to
assert
such
power
to
that
in
conflict
with
that
basic
premises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
cohen,
does
that
answer
the
problem
for
us
even
if
you
had
no
8
(d)
would
this
problem
still?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
that
it
is
an
arguable
that
because
of
the
basic
premise
of
regulation
to
bring
about
collective
bargaining
ought
to
leave
the
terms
of
the
agreement
to
the
parties
are
also
--
will
be
the
agreement.
if
that
is
essentially
the
basis
of
the
--
behind
the
legislation
then
that
doesn't
raise
the
question
whether
on
that
circumstance,
the
board
can
assert
this
problem,
mr.
cohen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
should
go
a
little
beyond
that.
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
others
have
to
do
deliberation
decided
that
government
was
not
going
to
write
labor
contract
and
it
wasn’t
going
to
allow
any
agents
of
the
government
proscribe
so
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
that
so
then
i
would
suppose
that’s
very
powerful
argument
that
the
board
can
assert
in
the
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
winson
i
gather
that
the
