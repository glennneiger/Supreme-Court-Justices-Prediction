justice
hugo
l.
black
what
substantive
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
are
you
using
citation
to
a
place
where
the
board
compelled
by
words
the
other
party
to
agree
to
specific
provision
on
the
contrary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
part
of
the
appendix,
i
now
have
it
before
me?
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
phrase
that
you
relied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
and
its
questions
that
were
presented,
it
agrees
with
you
that
the
issues
whether
it
has
power
to
compel
the
making
of
that
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
denial
of
it
in
any
other
part
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
agreed
that
the
question
is,
whether
under
the
law
the
board
on
any
circumstances
has
power
to
compel
a
company
to
agree
to
a
specific
term
in
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
i
understood
both
of
you
say
the
petition
has
never
been
presented
to
the
court
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
must
never
been
a
court
which
never
been
presented
to
us
without
standing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
argued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
in
your
remedy
if
it
was
same
and
clearly
shown
under
your
argument
as
the
employer
has
just
decided
he
will
not
agree
to
anything,
he
will
not
sign
the
contract,
he
keeps
it
going
for
5
to
10
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
about
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
i
had
a
big
recollection
that
we
had
in
a
point
of
any
contempt
case
before,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
you'll
probably
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
this
as
i
understand
your
adversary's
argument
do
you
think
could
good
faith
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
law
does
not
justify
the
board
in
commanding
that
the
particular
provision
be
put
on
contract,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
congress
will
pass
the
law
providing
the
checkoff,
can
you
think
of
any
constitutional
objection
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
they're
going
through
a
form?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
collective-bargaining
and
agreeing
to
bargain
but
in
reality
they
won't
bargain
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
the
remedy
if
this
is
not
the
remedy
i
mentioned
it
sometimes
for
years
to
state,
well,
i
don’t
want
to
do
this,
right?
i
would
say
that
many
of
the
things,
i'm
not
going
to
collect
dues
from
my
workers.
i
just
don't
--
that’s
not
a
part
of
my
business,
i
don't
want
to
have
bookkeeper
for
that,
could
that
be
legitimate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
on
the
other
hand
if
instead
that
being,
you
say
the
board
is
entrusted
with
the
power
to
determine.
well,
that's
not
your
real
reason;
your
real
reason
is
you
just
don't
want
to
make
any
bargaining,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
bargaining
at
all.
therefore,
that
would
it
not
sometime
get
to
a
position
if
that
is
right.
well,
if
you
cannot
order
that
the
contract
be
signed
on
a
point
that
the
board
sales
and
that
the
men
could
keep
it
going
on
forever.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
which
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about
that
legislative
history?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
over
there
at
that
time
and
i
don't
know
but
is
there
anything
that
you
see
in
any
way
indicated
that
any
of
the
senators
or
congress
had
in
mind
that
the
board
could
do
this
or
is
it
more
in
the
line
but
following
the
ideas
of
the
railroad
labor
act
which
when
you
reach
the
end
you
still
got
to
strike
a
lockout.
now
what
did
you
find
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicated
caution?
i'm
kind
of
to
agree
with
you
logically
as
to
what
should
be
done
if
they
want
to
force
you
for
governmental
action.
well,
what
do
you
find
that
indicates
that
there
was
any
desire
in
anybody
to
force
you
by
governmental
action
except
by
degree
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
happen
to
know
a
man
in
alabama
who's
a
big
employer.
i
have
no
doubt
on
this
about
why
he
would've
objected.
he
didn't
like
the
union.
he
didn't
like
to
deal
with
it
and
he
would
rather
surrender
almost
a
bit
that's
not
the
deal.
now,
i
had
no
thought
that
the
board
would
have
power
to
make
him
deal
with
them
that
way
to
certain
terms.
they
can
make
them
bargain
and
negotiate
it.
now,
i
never
thought
of
that
act
as
being
anything
more
than
one
which
is
like
the
labor
relations
to
let
him
on
as
far
as
you
could
lead
him
and
when
he
got
a
daggers
point
to
let
him
fight
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
take
it
that
man
testified
in
this
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would--
may
say
that
that
man
testified
at
this
hearing
i
was
talking
about
or
the
act
and
he
testified
against
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
how
logically
you're
right
if
we
won
the
case
to
the
end
where
the
government
on
a
force
an
agreement
not
which
would
keep
him
strike,
which
the
court
give
him
in
a
lockout.
i
agree
as
justice
douglas
asked
you,
you
could
try
to
contempt.
you
put
him
in
jail
for
contempt.
he
has
his
word
i
don't
want
to
deal
with
unions.
and
you
say
well,
that's
not
it
if
you
just
don't
want
to
make
any
contract
at
all.
and
you
get
that
finally
on
a
bad
basis
to
prosecute
him
in
criminally,
but
i
cannot
see
why
accepting
what
you
say
because
it
seems
to
me
here
by
and
to
decide
in
all
(inaudible)
experience
for
a
man
who
cross
that
way.
i'd
say
he
just
(inaudible)
around
it's
a
sham,
it's
a
sham.[laughter
attempt]
but
that's
a
pretty,
that’s
a
pretty
thin
ground
on
which
a
man
to
send
a
jail
for
contempt
to,
and
that's
what
it
will
finally
come
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
intended
to
object
on
one
ground
when
in
reality
it
was
objected
on
another
and
that’s
the
question
you'd
have
to
submit
to
a
jury
in
a
contempt
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
but
congress
has
yet
said
it
want
to
go
that
far
i'm
afraid
in
connection
with
the
employer
is
due
just
as
it
puts
on
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
many.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
it
would
be
many.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
can
no
further
bargaining
because
the
board
has
ordered
that
he
has
except
the
provision
to
which
either
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
criticizing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
want
(voice
overlap)
is
our
proposition
just
like
we
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whom
do
you
represent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
i
thought
you're
arguing
on
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
against
the
board's
order
or
court’s
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
concurring
the
act?
who
the
sole
giving
to
the
board
dealt
five
conditions,
are
you
--
it
must
be
accept?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
if
remedy
is
necessary
to
tell
people
they
got
to
sign
a
contract
with
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
say
the
violation
is
that
they
just
stick
to
one
view
and
they
won't
leave
it
five
years.
what
is
your
opinion
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
then
that
if
the
board
finds
a
reasonable
fact,
reasonable
support
theory
that
the
man
really
is
not
interested
in
against
union’s
checkoff
but
then
they
can
force
him
to
sign
a
checkoff
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sure
thing
but
he
was
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
union
have
been
bucking,
it
said,
we
don’t
want
the
checkoff,
we
want
to
collect
that
money
out
of
sales
appear
to
word,
is
that
compare?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
are
going
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
bad
faith
so
that
you
can
read
it
real
loud
as
not
to
put
a
man
in
jail
for
contempt
to
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
close,
i
like
to
say
i
had
the
(inaudible)
comment
said
mr.
cohen
representing
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
that's
acted
and
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
either
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
went
odd.
there
was
odd,
one
of
them
said,
i
won’t
do
it
if
it’s
in
there;
and
the
other
one
said,
i
won't
do
it
unless
it
isn’t.
justice

a
jail
for
contempt
to,
and
that's
what
it
will
finally
come
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
intended
to
object
on
one
ground
when
in
reality
it
was
objected
on
another
and
that’s
the
question
you'd
have
to
submit
to
a
jury
in
a
contempt
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
but
congress
has
yet
said
it
want
to
go
that
far
i'm
afraid
in
connection
with
the
employer
is
due
just
as
it
puts
on
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
many.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
it
would
be
many.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
can
no
further
bargaining
because
the
board
has
ordered
that
he
has
except
the
provision
to
which
either
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
criticizing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
want
(voice
overlap)
is
our
proposition
just
like
we
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whom
do
you
represent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
i
thought
you're
arguing
on
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
against
the
board's
order
or
court’s
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
concurring
the
act?
who
the
sole
giving
to
the
board
dealt
five
conditions,
are
you
--
it
must
be
accept?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
if
remedy
is
necessary
to
tell
people
they
got
to
sign
a
contract
with
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
say
the
violation
is
that
they
just
stick
to
one
view
and
they
won't
leave
it
five
years.
what
is
your
opinion
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
then
that
if
the
board
finds
a
reasonable
fact,
reasonable
support
theory
that
the
man
really
is
not
interested
in
against
union’s
checkoff
but
then
they
can
force
him
to
sign
a
checkoff
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sure
thing
but
he
was
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
union
have
been
bucking,
it
said,
we
don’t
want
the
checkoff,
we
want
to
collect
that
money
out
of
sales
appear
to
word,
is
that
compare?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
are
going
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
bad
faith
so
that
you
can
read
it
real
loud
as
not
to
put
a
man
in
jail
for
contempt
to
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
close,
i
like
to
say
i
had
the
(inaudible)
comment
said
mr.
cohen
representing
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
that's
acted
and
(voice
overlaps)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
either
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
went
odd.
there
was
odd,
one
of
them
said,
i
won’t
do
it
if
it’s
in
there;
and
the
other
one
said,
i
won't
do
it
unless
it
isn’t.
