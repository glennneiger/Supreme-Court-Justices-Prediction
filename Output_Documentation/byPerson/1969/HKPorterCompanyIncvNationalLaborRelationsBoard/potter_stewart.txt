where
is
that
in
the
record?
do
you
have
it
off
hand
to
page
9
of
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
where
that
is
in
the
appendix,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
i
mean
the
--
wouldn't
that
order
of
the
board
be
in
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
will
be
somewhere
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
get
your
position
straight
to
you.
it
is
clear
is
it
not
that
it's
first
time
of
the
board
never
done
this
ordered
either
party
to
a
collective-bargaining,
to
agree
to
a
particular
provision
in
the
contract,
is
that
correct
or
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
this
is
therefore
not
a
very
important
but
nonetheless
it
is
not
a
very
important
case
because
this
is
unique
(voice
overlap)
it's
not
very
unique
but
i
think
that’s
tautological
if
it's
unique,
it’s
unique.
that's
a
first
time
that
the
board
has
ever
ordered
this
remedy
and
you
must
be
saying
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
first
that
an
employer
has
ever
behaved
this
way
and
it’s
through
the
board,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
frankly
think
then
that
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
would
mean
that
the
board
could
impose
this
remedy
in
any
8
(b)
and
(c)
(5)
violation.
whenever
there's
the
finding
of
lack
of
good
faith
bargaining
it
seems
to
me
then
the
board
would
have
power
to
impose
it
somehow.
and
i
think
that
might
has
to
be
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
that
broad
mr.
come?
what
about
arbitration
clause?
i
don't
think
things
have
changed
much
since
i
was
in
the
practice.
employers
views
about
arbitration
clauses
where
much
as
you
described
what
you
say
was
the
position
taken
here
by
the
spokesman
for
the
company
as
to
the
checkbook.
can
you
conceive
that
the
board,
there'd
circumstances
in
which
the
board
could
compel
an
employer
decide
an
arbitration?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
the
usual
argument;
i
used
to
make
that
kind
of
argument
in
court.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
law
in
the
area
of
aid
and
comfort,
they're
not
going
to
lend
that
practically.
