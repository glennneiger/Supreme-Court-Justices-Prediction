mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
although
this
is
a
noble
remedy
this
is
far
from
a
landmark
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
remedies
stems
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
which
are
very
unique.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
very,
very
briefly.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not,
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
closest
that
this
court
has
had
has
been
a
case
like
times
for
example
very
early
today
where
an
employer
agreed
to
a
contract
and
refuse
to
put
it
into
writing
and
that
situation
the
board
ordered
him
to
execute
the
contract
and
this
court
sustained
that
remedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
act
now
in
8
(d)
specifically
says
that
he
must
do
that.
now,
the
employer
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
might
be
if
you
get
a
union
in
the
situation
that
this
employer
got
himself
into.
i
think
that
this
employer
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
very
briefly
faded
himself
into
such
a
corner
that
the
considerable
freedom
that
he
had
to
bargain
he
deliberately
gave
up
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
board
did
your
honor
in
so
far
as
the
basic
violation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
thought
that
the
stereo
type
refusal
of
the
bargain
remedy
would
cure
the
situation
but
in
the
light
of
the
post
decree
and
negotiations,
the
further
in
like
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
the
board
and
after
all
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
partners
in
this
business
of
trying
to
work
out
a
satisfactory
administration
of
the
act,
long
appreciated
that
for
this
unusual
type
of
situation
something
more
than
the
conventional
order
to
bargain
was
required.
now,
this
is
a
situation
whereon
the
board's
unfair
labor
practice
findings
which
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
this
court
denied
the
company’s
petition
for
certiorari
on.
we
have
a
situation
where
an
employer
has
twice
been
found
to
have
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
union
--
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement
with
the
union
--
any
agreement
with
the
union.
and
the
last
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
could
produce
an
improper
impasse
if
the
employer's
reasons
for
refusing
to
agree
are
bad
faith
reasons.
now,
here
is
a
situation
where
after
the
first
refusal
to
bargain
order
--
i
might
say
that
the
union
was
first
certified
in
1961
for
the
next
--
the
first
set
of
negotiations
broke
off
in
1962.
the
board
found
that
the
company
was
refusing
the
bargain
in
good
faith
and
that
order
was
enforced
by
the
fourth
circuit.
they
then
resumed
negotiations
in
october
of
1963
and
they
had
21
meetings
and
had
still
not
reached
in
agreement.
it
was
only
after
the
20th
meeting
that
the
company
gave
up
on
one
of
the
demands
that
was
found
to
be
a
basis
for
the
refusal
of
the
bargain
the
first
time.
at
the
end
of
the
21st
meeting,
you
had
three
issues
which
was
still
unresolved
--
wages,
insurance
and
the
union's
request
for
a
checkoff
provision.
now,
the
record
showed
that
the
company
did
not
resist
a
checkoff
because
there
was
any
convenience
to
the
company.
you
have
the
chief
negotiator
of
the
company
admitting
that
in
the
record
or
for
any
other
business
reason
or
because
there
was
a
company
policy
against
the
checkoff.
he
pointed
out
that
the
company
regularly
made
payroll
deductions
at
this
plant
for
government
bonds,
for
health
insurance,
for
united
fund
which
is
equivalent
to
the
united
giver’s
fund
to
a
good
neighbor
or
sunshine
fund
and
he
conceded
that
there
was
no
more
inconvenience
in
checking
off
union
dues
and
there
was
in
checking
off
for
these
other
purposes.
he
further
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
that
your
honor
has
suggested
that
would
be
so
in
the
ronald
case
(voice
overlap)
and
i
think
i
could
assume
arguendo
that
perhaps
it
might
be,
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
was
anything
like
that
here
because
you
had
five
years
of
bargaining
negotiations,
there
was
no
suggestion
at
all
that
the
checkoff
was
being
used
as
a
trading
device
certainly
in
the
course
of
five
years
of
negotiations
where
you
are
bargaining
back
and
forth
if
the
checkoff
is
going
to
be
use
as
a
trading
device,
that
would
have
appear.
the
company
negotiator
frankly
conceded
at
the
board
hearing
that
is
only
reason
for
not
giving
the
checkoff
was
that
the
company
was
not
going
to
aid
and
comfort
the
union
at
this
location.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
an
illegitimate
reason
that
has
hypothetical
to
the
basic
tenants
of
bargaining
in
good
faith
because
if
you
have
to
recognize
a
union
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
as
this
employer
did
in
bargain
in
good
faith
with
a
view
toward
entering
into
a
contract
--
anything
that
you're
given
a
contract
is
going
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
union.
and
this
employer
was
making
that
a
touchstone.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
indicated
it
beyond
that
that
really
the
reason
that
he
wasn't
giving
it
was
just
because
the
union
was
asking
for
it
because
he
had
agreed
to
checkoff
for
other
purposes.
he
agreed
that
there
was
no
greater
inconvenience
in
doing
it
for
union
dues.
and
indeed,
the
further
conceded
that
at
other
plants
they
did
checkoff
union
dues
and
as
the
company
counsel
stated
at
one
point
in
the
record
that
page
16
that
perhaps
our
refusal
to
grant
the
checkoff
clause
has
been
harassed
of
the
international
union.
now,
given
this
history
in
this
context,
the
board
was
justified
in
concluding
as
it
did
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
this
was
not
a
company
that
had
a
good
faith
reason
for
withholding
the
checkoff.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
an
employer
has
to
grant
a
checkoff,
they
cannot
in
good
faith
refuse
to
grant
a
checkoff,
but
this
was
an
employer
who
withhold
a
checkoff
for
the
sole
reason
of
blocking
an
agreement
with
the
union
and
that
indeed
he
had
indicated
that
not
only
was
this
his
reason
but
he
had
no
other
reason
for
withholding
a
checkoff.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
cannot.
i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
their
argument,
i
think
is
the
one
that
justice
brennan
suggested
in
which
i
intend
to
come
to
in
a
moment
namely
that
8
(d)
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
10
(c)
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d)
in
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
ascertain
and
i've
studied
that
rather
carefully
shows
no
indication
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
a
remedy
once
you
had
established
that
the
refusal
of
bargain
was
in
bad
faith.
the
main
thrust
of
8
(d)
is
that
the
board
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
--
has
been
a
refusal
of
bargain
in
good
or
bad
faith
should
not
regard
as
decisive
or
determinate
that
there
--
in
determining
bad
faith
whether
or
not
the
employer
did
or
did
not
or
the
union
did
or
did
not
agree
to
a
certain
substantive
proposals
as
to
whether
they
were
reasonable
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
key
is
to
the
--
that
the
nature
of
a
violation
afford
the
standard
where
you
have
a
situation
like
you
have
here
where
the
employer
has
not
only
bargained
in
bad
faith
but
he
has
indicated
that
he
has
no
legitimate
reason
for
withholding
agreement
other
than
this
bad
faith
reason.
and
the
nature
of
the
proposal
is
one
like
a
checkoff
whereas
you
have
pointed
out.
it's
a
party
cut
and
drive
proposition.
i
mean
that
it
is
unlike
wages
in
the
sense
that
there
is
most
unlikely.
there
can
be
any
economic
or
business
consideration
that
would
qualify
the
amount
of
the
inquiries.
certainly,
in
that
kind
of
a
case
namely
the
checkoff
situation
it
is
not
doing
violence
to
the
policy
of
8
(d)
to
say
that
the
board
under
10
(c)
can
provide
this
kind
of
a
remedy
because
otherwise
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
so.
i
think
that
they
(voice
overlap)
they
have
used
their
refusal
to
agree
to
a
checkoff
as
a
cloak
for
not
agreeing
to
any
contract
with
the
union
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
that
were
his
reason
and
that
is
all
that
you
had,
there
was
no
--
there
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
here
to
begin
with.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
as
an
original
proposition
those
are
all
valid,
good
faith
reasons
for
refusing
an
arbitration
of
the
law.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
aid
and
comfort
in
this
case
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
all
of
the
facts
that
i
have
laid
up
which
shows
that
this
isn't
an
employer
who
has
turned
down
a
checkoff
either
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
get
in
to
the
dues
collection
business
because
it’s
inconvenient
for
him.
he
doesn't
want
to
prefer
the
union
to
other
predators
of
his
company
or
other
legitimate
reasons
that
you
could
think
of
which
would
be
perfectly
okay.
it
wouldn't
have
any
8
(a)
5
finding
to
begin
with
and
you'd
never
get
to
the
remedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
might
be
yes,
but
this
record,
i’m
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
at
some
point
those
reasons
should
come
out
if
you're
going
to
have
good
faith
bargaining
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
detroit
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
detroit
case
which
your
honor
it
involves
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
an
employer
who
claims
inability
to
pay
had
to
substantiate
his
claim
at
some
point
by
bringing
forth
his
records.
i
think
that
claims
made
in
bargaining
if
they're
in
good
faith
have
to
be
honest
claims
and
at
some
point
the
cards
have
to
be
laid
on
the
table
and
certainly
after
six
years
of
negotiations
as
we
had
here
if
the
company's
real
motive
was
to
hold
off
the
checkoff
for
trading
purposes
that
should
have
come
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
i
don’t
think
you’d
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
there
to
begin
with
for
two
reasons.
and
the
first
place
i
think
that
the
composition
of
the
union
bargaining
team
would
not
be
a
mandatory
subject
for
collective-bargaining,
it
does
not
within
the
area
of
wages
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
it
is
well
settled
and
the
company
does
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is
that
recent
but
in
any
event
most
people
in
the
field
would
readily
agree
that
that
is
within
the
area
of
wages,
hours
and
other
conditions
--
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
but
the
composition
of
the
union
bargaining
team
had
vast
a
permissive
subject
of
collective-bargaining
like
the
strike
valid
clause
or
who
signs
the
agreement
type
of
thing
that
the
court
had
in
borg-warner
and
the
court
indicated
there
that
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
stuff
although
the
parties
may
be
able
to
propose.
they
cannot
insist
on
impasse.
secondly,
even
if
it
were
within
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining
on
the
set
of
facts
that
you
give
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
union
has
a
valid
justification
for
refusing
to
enlarge
the
bargaining
team.
now,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
may
well
be,
your
honor
but
as
yet
the
statute
only
requires
bargaining
about
wages,
hours,
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
that’s
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
haven't
thought
about
it
your
honor.
i'm
not
but
i
think
that
the
essential
predicate
though
that
to
order
in
this
case
and
that
i
find
lacking
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
i've
been
getting
is
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
threshold
finding
by
the
board
that
the
refusal
to
grant
the
checkoff
was
in
bad
faith.
and
that
the
sole
purpose
for
refusing
to
grant
it
was
to
frustrate
in
agreement
with
the
union
as
justice
black
said.
the
company
went
through
the
motions
of
bargaining
what
it
really
didn’t
want
in
agreement
and
it
was
holding
off
on
the
checkoff
because
that
was
the
way
of
carrying
out
its
scheme
of
frustrating
an
agreement.
now,
further
more
you
have
a
record
which
shows
did
not
only
was
this
employer
has
reason
but
he
had
no
other
conceivable
reason
for
opposing
a
checkoff
so
that
you'll
have
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
over
the
checkoff
based
upon
this
kind
of
evidence.
and
the
limited
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
board
has
power
to
compel
concessions
under
other
circumstances
but
whether
given
this
particular
unfair
labor
practice
finding
that
it
is
grounded
as
i
have
indicated
the
board
as
a
remedy
for
the
refusal
--
that
kind
of
a
refusal
bargain
clearly
order
a
checkoff.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
get
this
kind
of
a
unique
situation,
a
checkoff
--
in
order
to
grant
the
checkoff
is
really
the
only
frank
thing
to
do
because
an
order
to
bargain
in
good
faith
suggests
that
there's
something
left
that
you
could
bargain
about.
now,
in
the
situation
that
i
have
presented,
the
employer
has
so
painted
himself
into
the
corner
that
there
is
nothing
to
talk
about
--
talk
would
only
make
for
additional
delay
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
when
he
goes
back
he
can't
give
the
same
reasons
that
he
gave
before
for
refusing
a
checkoff
and
to
permit
him
at
this
point
to
manufacture
new
reasons
that
he
admitted
before
were
not
a
factor
but
make
a
mockery
of
the
collective-bargaining
process.
so
what
we're
left
with
then
is
whether
or
not
8
(d)
in
this
particular
situation
that
i'm
talking
about
would
preclude
the
board
from
using
its
10
(c)
powers
which
would
otherwise
be
broad
enough
to
permit
this
kind
of
a
remedy
when
absolutely
by
the
board
in
this
situation
from
ordering
a
checkoff.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
for
the
reason
that
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d)
shows
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
there
was
the
board
making
the
initial
finding
of
bad
faith
based
upon
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
concede
or
to
a
union
proposal
because
of
the
board’s
judgment
that
since
it
was
a
reasonable
proposal,
it
was
unreasonable
and
therefore
bad
faith
for
him
to
refuse
to
agree.
that
is
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
was
silent
on
the
question
of
what
kind
of
remedy
the
board
could
impose
once
it
found
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
history
is
directed
to
the
elements
that
go
into
finding
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
or
bad
faith
to
begin
with.
and
there,
the
history
indicates
that
congress
didn't
want
the
board
to
make
a
bad
faith
bargaining
finding
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
employer
had
refused
to
make
a
concession.
that's
as
far
as
the
history
of
8
(d)
carries
you
and
as
i
showed
you
earlier
the
board's
bad
faith
finding
here
is
not
based
on
any
such
consideration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
place,
this
court
recognized
even
in
insurance
agents
(voice
overlap)
that
even
in
finding
the
--
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
initial
refusal
of
bargain
in
good
faith.
there
is
a
tension
between
the
freedom
of
contract
and
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
judge
magruder
put
it
and
read
in
parens,
you
can't
be
blinded
wholly
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposals.
i
mean
if
there
--
but
beyond
that
once
you
have
found
on
the
basis
of
ample
evidence
that
has
nothing
to
do
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposals
that
the
employer
has
bargained
in
bad
faith.
you
have
to
balance
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
of
8
(d)
against
other
policies
of
the
act
--
the
policy
of
bargaining
in
good
faith
toward
an
agreement
is
the
policy
of
an
effect
or
providing
effective
remedies
for
serious
--
for
refusals
to
bargain
and
are
meaningful
in
the
particular
context.
then
when
you
balance
those
policies
against
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
in
a
particular
situation
that
we
have
here,
we
submit
that
on
balance
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
policy
of
10
(c)
predominates.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
finding
of
the
board
was
most
clearly
rearticulated
in
its
supplemental
decision
where
on
page
135
whereas
it
says,
as
the
respondent
has
repeatedly
violated
section
8
(a)
5
admittedly
had
no
business
for
opposing
the
checkoff
and
has
its
only
reason
for
such
our
opposition
was
to
frustrate
agreement
with
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
board
specifically
found
that
the
purpose
was
to
weaken
the
union.
i
think
that
that
is
the
implicit
in
the
finding
that
the
sole
purpose
and
only
purpose
was
to
frustrate
in
agreement
because
that
has
been
necessary
consequence
of
refusing
to
agree
in
bad
faith
over
a
period
of
five
years
as
went
on
here.
i
think
that
the
history
of
why
8
(a)
5
was
put
into
the
act
shows
that
congress
recognized
that
was
so
to
take
put
in
an
affirmative
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
because
it
was
recognized
by
senator
wagner
and
others
that
a
mere
obligation
to
recognize
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
there
is
a
bar
an
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
view
to
arriving
in
an
agreement
because
if
you
don’t
do
that
in
good
faith
and
try
to
coming
on
an
agreement
that
is
necessarily
going
to
wear
down
the
union
and
weaken
it.
and
that
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
quite
true.
however,
the
union
is
entitled
to
hold
out
for
a
checkoff
so
long
as
the
employer
is
in
bad
faith
refusing
to
give
up
on
the
checkoff.
here,
the
employer,
he’s
not
refusing
a
checkoff
for
a
valid
reason
which
he
could
do
and
if
the
union
refuse
to
give
up
on
the
checkoff,
that
would
be
a
frustrating
if
the
agreement
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
where
the
refusal
to
get
an
agreement
is
due
to
the
employer's
bad
faith
refusal
to
give
you
the
checkoff,
then
it
is
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
because
what
the
employer
is
doing
there
is
he
is
using
the
refusal
to
give
you
the
checkoff
really
as
a
sham
for
not
dealing
with
this
union
at
all
and
that
is
what
the
noble
this
case
is
and
the
question
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
it's
a
much
more
forthright
thing
for
the
board
to
specifically
tell
the
company
in
its
order
what
it
is
that
is
needed
to
demonstrate
his
good
faith.
that's
why
the
whole
order
here
was
made
specific.
now,
cut
to
come
back
to
your
example
justice
black.
i
think
that
there's
no
point
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
if
you
have
to
distinguish
a
hard
bargaining
case
from
a
case
that
such
as
we
have
here
only
--
there's
no
question
that
has
original
proposition
an
employer
doesn't
have
to
agree
to
proposals
that
the
--
just
because
of
the
union
is
making
them
i
mean
there's
plenty
of
room
for
good
faith
collective-bargaining
even
though
that
means
that
he
end
up
at
low
overheads
and
the
union
has
the
option
of
either
striking
or
the
employer
of
lacking
up.
that
is
not
in
this
case,
this
is
an
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
on
the
findings
of
the
board
that
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
this
is
a
case
of
an
employer
who
is
going
through
bargaining
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
by
making
the
requirement
specific
you
avoid
a
contempt
action
with
the
–
because
the
employer
knows
what
he
has
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor
i
submit
that
this
is
a
remedy
problem
for
a
very
unusual
type
of
situation
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
because
in
the
usual
situation,
you
cannot
or
you
either
find
that
there's
just
been
a
hard
bargaining
or
you
will
find
that
the
--
that
if
the
employer
has
acted
in
good
faith
you
cannot
say
from
the
record
that
further
bargaining
would
be
meaningless.
i
mean
he
has
not
indicated
as
this
employer
has.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
has
done
that
only
because
in
his
initial
bargaining
he
indicated
that
he
had
no
reason
other
than
the
invalid
reason
for
opposing
the
checkoff.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
that's
what
this
case
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
believe
that
although
this
is
a
noble
remedy
this
is
far
from
a
landmark
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
remedies
stems
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
which
are
very
unique.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
very,
very
briefly.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not,
to
my
knowledge
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
closest
that
this
court
has
had
has
been
a
case
like
times
for
example
very
early
today
where
an
employer
agreed
to
a
contract
and
refuse
to
put
it
into
writing
and
that
situation
the
board
ordered
him
to
execute
the
contract
and
this
court
sustained
that
remedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
act
now
in
8
(d)
specifically
says
that
he
must
do
that.
now,
the
employer
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
might
be
if
you
get
a
union
in
the
situation
that
this
employer
got
himself
into.
i
think
that
this
employer
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
very
briefly
faded
himself
into
such
a
corner
that
the
considerable
freedom
that
he
had
to
bargain
he
deliberately
gave
up
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
board
did
your
honor
in
so
far
as
the
basic
violation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
thought
that
the
stereo
type
refusal
of
the
bargain
remedy
would
cure
the
situation
but
in
the
light
of
the
post
decree
and
negotiations,
the
further
in
like
moment
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
the
board
and
after
all
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
partners
in
this
business
of
trying
to
work
out
a
satisfactory
administration
of
the
act,
long
appreciated
that
for
this
unusual
type
of
situation
something
more
than
the
conventional
order
to
bargain
was
required.
now,
this
is
a
situation
whereon
the
board's
unfair
labor
practice
findings
which
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
this
court
denied
the
company’s
petition
for
certiorari
on.
we
have
a
situation
where
an
employer
has
twice
been
found
to
have
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
union
--
the
purpose
of
frustrating
an
agreement
with
the
union
--
any
agreement
with
the
union.
and
the
last
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
could
produce
an
improper
impasse
if
the
employer's
reasons
for
refusing
to
agree
are
bad
faith
reasons.
now,
here
is
a
situation
where
after
the
first
refusal
to
bargain
order
--
i
might
say
that
the
union
was
first
certified
in
1961
for
the
next
--
the
first
set
of
negotiations
broke
off
in
1962.
the
board
found
that
the
company
was
refusing
the
bargain
in
good
faith
and
that
order
was
enforced
by
the
fourth
circuit.
they
then
resumed
negotiations
in
october
of
1963
and
they
had
21
meetings
and
had
still
not
reached
in
agreement.
it
was
only
after
the
20th
meeting
that
the
company
gave
up
on
one
of
the
demands
that
was
found
to
be
a
basis
for
the
refusal
of
the
bargain
the
first
time.
at
the
end
of
the
21st
meeting,
you
had
three
issues
which
was
still
unresolved
--
wages,
insurance
and
the
union's
request
for
a
checkoff
provision.
now,
the
record
showed
that
the
company
did
not
resist
a
checkoff
because
there
was
any
convenience
to
the
company.
you
have
the
chief
negotiator
of
the
company
admitting
that
in
the
record
or
for
any
other
business
reason
or
because
there
was
a
company
policy
against
the
checkoff.
he
pointed
out
that
the
company
regularly
made
payroll
deductions
at
this
plant
for
government
bonds,
for
health
insurance,
for
united
fund
which
is
equivalent
to
the
united
giver’s
fund
to
a
good
neighbor
or
sunshine
fund
and
he
conceded
that
there
was
no
more
inconvenience
in
checking
off
union
dues
and
there
was
in
checking
off
for
these
other
purposes.
he
further
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
that
your
honor
has
suggested
that
would
be
so
in
the
ronald
case
(voice
overlap)
and
i
think
i
could
assume
arguendo
that
perhaps
it
might
be,
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
was
anything
like
that
here
because
you
had
five
years
of
bargaining
negotiations,
there
was
no
suggestion
at
all
that
the
checkoff
was
being
used
as
a
trading
device
certainly
in
the
course
of
five
years
of
negotiations
where
you
are
bargaining
back
and
forth
if
the
checkoff
is
going
to
be
use
as
a
trading
device,
that
would
have
appear.
the
company
negotiator
frankly
conceded
at
the
board
hearing
that
is
only
reason
for
not
giving
the
checkoff
was
that
the
company
was
not
going
to
aid
and
comfort
the
union
at
this
location.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
is
an
illegitimate
reason
that
has
hypothetical
to
the
basic
tenants
of
bargaining
in
good
faith
because
if
you
have
to
recognize
a
union
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
as
this
employer
did
in
bargain
in
good
faith
with
a
view
toward
entering
into
a
contract
--
anything
that
you're
given
a
contract
is
going
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
union.
and
this
employer
was
making
that
a
touchstone.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
it
indicated
it
beyond
that
that
really
the
reason
that
he
wasn't
giving
it
was
just
because
the
union
was
asking
for
it
because
he
had
agreed
to
checkoff
for
other
purposes.
he
agreed
that
there
was
no
greater
inconvenience
in
doing
it
for
union
dues.
and
indeed,
the
further
conceded
that
at
other
plants
they
did
checkoff
union
dues
and
as
the
company
counsel
stated
at
one
point
in
the
record
that
page
16
that
perhaps
our
refusal
to
grant
the
checkoff
clause
has
been
harassed
of
the
international
union.
now,
given
this
history
in
this
context,
the
board
was
justified
in
concluding
as
it
did
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
this
was
not
a
company
that
had
a
good
faith
reason
for
withholding
the
checkoff.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
an
employer
has
to
grant
a
checkoff,
they
cannot
in
good
faith
refuse
to
grant
a
checkoff,
but
this
was
an
employer
who
withhold
a
checkoff
for
the
sole
reason
of
blocking
an
agreement
with
the
union
and
that
indeed
he
had
indicated
that
not
only
was
this
his
reason
but
he
had
no
other
reason
for
withholding
a
checkoff.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
cannot.
i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
their
argument,
i
think
is
the
one
that
justice
brennan
suggested
in
which
i
intend
to
come
to
in
a
moment
namely
that
8
(d)
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
10
(c)
in
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d)
in
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
ascertain
and
i've
studied
that
rather
carefully
shows
no
indication
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
a
remedy
once
you
had
established
that
the
refusal
of
bargain
was
in
bad
faith.
the
main
thrust
of
8
(d)
is
that
the
board
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
--
has
been
a
refusal
of
bargain
in
good
or
bad
faith
should
not
regard
as
decisive
or
determinate
that
there
--
in
determining
bad
faith
whether
or
not
the
employer
did
or
did
not
or
the
union
did
or
did
not
agree
to
a
certain
substantive
proposals
as
to
whether
they
were
reasonable
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
key
is
to
the
--
that
the
nature
of
a
violation
afford
the
standard
where
you
have
a
situation
like
you
have
here
where
the
employer
has
not
only
bargained
in
bad
faith
but
he
has
indicated
that
he
has
no
legitimate
reason
for
withholding
agreement
other
than
this
bad
faith
reason.
and
the
nature
of
the
proposal
is
one
like
a
checkoff
whereas
you
have
pointed
out.
it's
a
party
cut
and
drive
proposition.
i
mean
that
it
is
unlike
wages
in
the
sense
that
there
is
most
unlikely.
there
can
be
any
economic
or
business
consideration
that
would
qualify
the
amount
of
the
inquiries.
certainly,
in
that
kind
of
a
case
namely
the
checkoff
situation
it
is
not
doing
violence
to
the
policy
of
8
(d)
to
say
that
the
board
under
10
(c)
can
provide
this
kind
of
a
remedy
because
otherwise
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
so.
i
think
that
they
(voice
overlap)
they
have
used
their
refusal
to
agree
to
a
checkoff
as
a
cloak
for
not
agreeing
to
any
contract
with
the
union
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
that
were
his
reason
and
that
is
all
that
you
had,
there
was
no
--
there
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
here
to
begin
with.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
as
an
original
proposition
those
are
all
valid,
good
faith
reasons
for
refusing
an
arbitration
of
the
law.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
aid
and
comfort
in
this
case
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
all
of
the
facts
that
i
have
laid
up
which
shows
that
this
isn't
an
employer
who
has
turned
down
a
checkoff
either
because
he
doesn’t
want
to
get
in
to
the
dues
collection
business
because
it’s
inconvenient
for
him.
he
doesn't
want
to
prefer
the
union
to
other
predators
of
his
company
or
other
legitimate
reasons
that
you
could
think
of
which
would
be
perfectly
okay.
it
wouldn't
have
any
8
(a)
5
finding
to
begin
with
and
you'd
never
get
to
the
remedy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
might
be
yes,
but
this
record,
i’m
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
at
some
point
those
reasons
should
come
out
if
you're
going
to
have
good
faith
bargaining
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
detroit
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
detroit
case
which
your
honor
it
involves
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
an
employer
who
claims
inability
to
pay
had
to
substantiate
his
claim
at
some
point
by
bringing
forth
his
records.
i
think
that
claims
made
in
bargaining
if
they're
in
good
faith
have
to
be
honest
claims
and
at
some
point
the
cards
have
to
be
laid
on
the
table
and
certainly
after
six
years
of
negotiations
as
we
had
here
if
the
company's
real
motive
was
to
hold
off
the
checkoff
for
trading
purposes
that
should
have
come
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
i
don’t
think
you’d
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
there
to
begin
with
for
two
reasons.
and
the
first
place
i
think
that
the
composition
of
the
union
bargaining
team
would
not
be
a
mandatory
subject
for
collective-bargaining,
it
does
not
within
the
area
of
wages
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
it
is
well
settled
and
the
company
does
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is
that
recent
but
in
any
event
most
people
in
the
field
would
readily
agree
that
that
is
within
the
area
of
wages,
hours
and
other
conditions
--
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
but
the
composition
of
the
union
bargaining
team
had
vast
a
permissive
subject
of
collective-bargaining
like
the
strike
valid
clause
or
who
signs
the
agreement
type
of
thing
that
the
court
had
in
borg-warner
and
the
court
indicated
there
that
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
stuff
although
the
parties
may
be
able
to
propose.
they
cannot
insist
on
impasse.
secondly,
even
if
it
were
within
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining
on
the
set
of
facts
that
you
give
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
union
has
a
valid
justification
for
refusing
to
enlarge
the
bargaining
team.
now,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
may
well
be,
your
honor
but
as
yet
the
statute
only
requires
bargaining
about
wages,
hours,
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
that’s
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
haven't
thought
about
it
your
honor.
i'm
not
but
i
think
that
the
essential
predicate
though
that
to
order
in
this
case
and
that
i
find
lacking
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
i've
been
getting
is
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
threshold
finding
by
the
board
that
the
refusal
to
grant
the
checkoff
was
in
bad
faith.
and
that
the
sole
purpose
for
refusing
to
grant
it
was
to
frustrate
in
agreement
with
the
union
as
justice
black
said.
the
company
went
through
the
motions
of
bargaining
what
it
really
didn’t
want
in
agreement
and
it
was
holding
off
on
the
checkoff
because
that
was
the
way
of
carrying
out
its
scheme
of
frustrating
an
agreement.
now,
further
more
you
have
a
record
which
shows
did
not
only
was
this
employer
has
reason
but
he
had
no
other
conceivable
reason
for
opposing
a
checkoff
so
that
you'll
have
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
over
the
checkoff
based
upon
this
kind
of
evidence.
and
the
limited
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
board
has
power
to
compel
concessions
under
other
circumstances
but
whether
given
this
particular
unfair
labor
practice
finding
that
it
is
grounded
as
i
have
indicated
the
board
as
a
remedy
for
the
refusal
--
that
kind
of
a
refusal
bargain
clearly
order
a
checkoff.
and
we
submit
that
if
you
get
this
kind
of
a
unique
situation,
a
checkoff
--
in
order
to
grant
the
checkoff
is
really
the
only
frank
thing
to
do
because
an
order
to
bargain
in
good
faith
suggests
that
there's
something
left
that
you
could
bargain
about.
now,
in
the
situation
that
i
have
presented,
the
employer
has
so
painted
himself
into
the
corner
that
there
is
nothing
to
talk
about
--
talk
would
only
make
for
additional
delay
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
when
he
goes
back
he
can't
give
the
same
reasons
that
he
gave
before
for
refusing
a
checkoff
and
to
permit
him
at
this
point
to
manufacture
new
reasons
that
he
admitted
before
were
not
a
factor
but
make
a
mockery
of
the
collective-bargaining
process.
so
what
we're
left
with
then
is
whether
or
not
8
(d)
in
this
particular
situation
that
i'm
talking
about
would
preclude
the
board
from
using
its
10
(c)
powers
which
would
otherwise
be
broad
enough
to
permit
this
kind
of
a
remedy
when
absolutely
by
the
board
in
this
situation
from
ordering
a
checkoff.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
for
the
reason
that
the
legislative
history
of
8
(d)
shows
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
there
was
the
board
making
the
initial
finding
of
bad
faith
based
upon
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
concede
or
to
a
union
proposal
because
of
the
board’s
judgment
that
since
it
was
a
reasonable
proposal,
it
was
unreasonable
and
therefore
bad
faith
for
him
to
refuse
to
agree.
that
is
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
was
silent
on
the
question
of
what
kind
of
remedy
the
board
could
impose
once
it
found
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
history
is
directed
to
the
elements
that
go
into
finding
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
or
bad
faith
to
begin
with.
and
there,
the
history
indicates
that
congress
didn't
want
the
board
to
make
a
bad
faith
bargaining
finding
based
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
employer
had
refused
to
make
a
concession.
that's
as
far
as
the
history
of
8
(d)
carries
you
and
as
i
showed
you
earlier
the
board's
bad
faith
finding
here
is
not
based
on
any
such
consideration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
place,
this
court
recognized
even
in
insurance
agents
(voice
overlap)
that
even
in
finding
the
--
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
initial
refusal
of
bargain
in
good
faith.
there
is
a
tension
between
the
freedom
of
contract
and
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
judge
magruder
put
it
and
read
in
parens,
you
can't
be
blinded
wholly
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposals.
i
mean
if
there
--
but
beyond
that
once
you
have
found
on
the
basis
of
ample
evidence
that
has
nothing
to
do
the
reasonableness
of
the
proposals
that
the
employer
has
bargained
in
bad
faith.
you
have
to
balance
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
of
8
(d)
against
other
policies
of
the
act
--
the
policy
of
bargaining
in
good
faith
toward
an
agreement
is
the
policy
of
an
effect
or
providing
effective
remedies
for
serious
--
for
refusals
to
bargain
and
are
meaningful
in
the
particular
context.
then
when
you
balance
those
policies
against
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
in
a
particular
situation
that
we
have
here,
we
submit
that
on
balance
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
policy
of
10
(c)
predominates.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
finding
of
the
board
was
most
clearly
rearticulated
in
its
supplemental
decision
where
on
page
135
whereas
it
says,
as
the
respondent
has
repeatedly
violated
section
8
(a)
5
admittedly
had
no
business
for
opposing
the
checkoff
and
has
its
only
reason
for
such
our
opposition
was
to
frustrate
agreement
with
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
board
specifically
found
that
the
purpose
was
to
weaken
the
union.
i
think
that
that
is
the
implicit
in
the
finding
that
the
sole
purpose
and
only
purpose
was
to
frustrate
in
agreement
because
that
has
been
necessary
consequence
of
refusing
to
agree
in
bad
faith
over
a
period
of
five
years
as
went
on
here.
i
think
that
the
history
of
why
8
(a)
5
was
put
into
the
act
shows
that
congress
recognized
that
was
so
to
take
put
in
an
affirmative
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
because
it
was
recognized
by
senator
wagner
and
others
that
a
mere
obligation
to
recognize
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
there
is
a
bar
an
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
view
to
arriving
in
an
agreement
because
if
you
don’t
do
that
in
good
faith
and
try
to
coming
on
an
agreement
that
is
necessarily
going
to
wear
down
the
union
and
weaken
it.
and
that
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
quite
true.
however,
the
union
is
entitled
to
hold
out
for
a
checkoff
so
long
as
the
employer
is
in
bad
faith
refusing
to
give
up
on
the
checkoff.
here,
the
employer,
he’s
not
refusing
a
checkoff
for
a
valid
reason
which
he
could
do
and
if
the
union
refuse
to
give
up
on
the
checkoff,
that
would
be
a
frustrating
if
the
agreement
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
but
where
the
refusal
to
get
an
agreement
is
due
to
the
employer's
bad
faith
refusal
to
give
you
the
checkoff,
then
it
is
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith
because
what
the
employer
is
doing
there
is
he
is
using
the
refusal
to
give
you
the
checkoff
really
as
a
sham
for
not
dealing
with
this
union
at
all
and
that
is
what
the
noble
this
case
is
and
the
question
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
it's
a
much
more
forthright
thing
for
the
board
to
specifically
tell
the
company
in
its
order
what
it
is
that
is
needed
to
demonstrate
his
good
faith.
that's
why
the
whole
order
here
was
made
specific.
now,
cut
to
come
back
to
your
example
justice
black.
i
think
that
there's
no
point
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
if
you
have
to
distinguish
a
hard
bargaining
case
from
a
case
that
such
as
we
have
here
only
--
there's
no
question
that
has
original
proposition
an
employer
doesn't
have
to
agree
to
proposals
that
the
--
just
because
of
the
union
is
making
them
i
mean
there's
plenty
of
room
for
good
faith
collective-bargaining
even
though
that
means
that
he
end
up
at
low
overheads
and
the
union
has
the
option
of
either
striking
or
the
employer
of
lacking
up.
that
is
not
in
this
case,
this
is
an
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
on
the
findings
of
the
board
that
were
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
this
is
a
case
of
an
employer
who
is
going
through
bargaining
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
by
making
the
requirement
specific
you
avoid
a
contempt
action
with
the
–
because
the
employer
knows
what
he
has
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
your
honor
i
submit
that
this
is
a
remedy
problem
for
a
very
unusual
type
of
situation
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
because
in
the
usual
situation,
you
cannot
or
you
either
find
that
there's
just
been
a
hard
bargaining
or
you
will
find
that
the
--
that
if
the
employer
has
acted
in
good
faith
you
cannot
say
from
the
record
that
further
bargaining
would
be
meaningless.
i
mean
he
has
not
indicated
as
this
employer
has.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
has
done
that
only
because
in
his
initial
bargaining
he
indicated
that
he
had
no
reason
other
than
the
invalid
reason
for
opposing
the
checkoff.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
that's
what
this
case
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
