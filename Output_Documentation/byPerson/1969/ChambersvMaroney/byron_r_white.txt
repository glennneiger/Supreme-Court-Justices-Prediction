justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
practice
in
the
pittsburgh
when
the
legal
aid
group
represents
the
defendant?
is
the
--
there
was
an
appointment
here,
wasn't
it?
was
there
an
appointment
or
did
he
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
can
you
tell
us
or
can't
you
when
this
gentleman
that
he
met
in
the
hallway
first
knew
he
was
going
to
represent
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
know
is
that
he
met
him
in
the
hallway?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
legal
aid
society
or
whatever
the
name
of
it
is,
know
that
they
are
going
rep
--
somebody
from
that
chapter
is
going
to
represent
them
long
ever
since
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
record
show
whether
anybody
have
been
doing
any
work
on
the
case
until
the
day
of
the
second
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
assuming
that
they
were
giving
at
no
attention
in
the
meantime?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
that
there
are
no
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
this
in
lieu
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
represent
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
been
a
habeas
corpus
petition
hearing
on
the
question
of
advocacy
of
counsel,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
plan
to
spent
some
time
on
the
search
and
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
pretrial
motions
before
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
opportunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
this
car
taken
to
the
police
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
co-defendants
and
with
the
policeman
in
the
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
you
have
problem
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
man
and
you
find
him
in
his
car
somewhere,
can
you
arrest
him?
do
you
think
the
--
you
put
him
in
the
patrol
car,
would
you
think
the
police
have
the
right
to
seize
the
car
and
take
it
the
station
or
anywhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
probable
cause
did
they
get
to
seize
the
care?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
just
to
get
it
off
the
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
where
it
is
parked
within
a
--
somewhere
where
it
doesn't
say
no
parking.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
couldn't
take
it
at
the
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they
could
take
it
to
the
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
can
impound
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
you
tie
it
up
so
that
the
defendant's
wife
couldn't
come
and
just
drive
it
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
somebody
fills
up
with
the
car,
they
parked
the
car
in
a
legal
parking
zone,
take
the
man
at
the
police
station
and
leave
an
officer
with
the
car
and
the
wife
shows
up
at
the
car
and
says
give
me,
i
want
the
car,
i
want
to
drive
it
away.
they
couldn't
hold
it,
could
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
cooper.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
harris,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
then
was
presented
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
thought
that
withdrawing
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
he
--
he
withdrew
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
wasn't
an
adequate
hearing
in
the
state
court
because
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
los.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
will
tell
us
all
the
facts
of
withdrawal
of
counsel
at
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
offer
anything
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
objection
to
the
–
certainly,
the
petitioner
had
consultations
at
his
first
time
with
the
legal
aid
society
representatives.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
ample
time
that
there
for
pretrial
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
the
record
that
has
not
been
fully
developed
on
this
counsel
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
state
court
judge
who
passed
on
the
habeas
corpus
petition
actually
reached
the
counsel
point,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
he
do
that
if
the
point
had
been
withdrawn?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
--
where
do
we
stand
on
exhaustion
then
that
the
state
court
actually
purported
to
dispose
of
the
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
with
preston?
justice
byron

you
do
with

you
take
it
and
lock
him
--
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
but
where
was
the
car
when
they
searched
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
understand,
what
is
your
position?
once
they
gather
to
the
station,
they
have
expect
the
block
--
they
then
hide
the
car
where
empty
station
--
justice
byron

now,
what
(inaudible)

they
would
want

where
the

was
arrested.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
the
custody
of
the

legal?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wife
or
brother
or
anybody
else
has
showed
up
and
take
this
car,
just
when
they
wanted
to
search
it,
they
have
to
let
it
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
search
it
and
they
could
search
it,
i
don't
think
they
can
hold
the
search?
