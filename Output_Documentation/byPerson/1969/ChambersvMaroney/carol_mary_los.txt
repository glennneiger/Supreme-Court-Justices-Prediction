ms.

mary

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commonwealth
the
pennsylvania
would
readily
agree
that
certainly
no
man
should
be
asked
to
stand
trial
on
serious
criminal
charges
or
in
any
charges
unless
he
has
had
adequate
opportunity
to
discuss
his
case
with
counsel.
but
certainly
counsel
shouldn't
be
forced
to
represent
the
man
with
only
a
few
moments
notice.
this
we
feel
destroys
any
semblance
of
the
attorney-client
relationship,
because
not
only
does
it
land
itself
to
the
fact
that
the
attorney
might
not
be
adequately
prepared
but
also
he
may
likely
in
conation
to
act
as
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
his
client.
fortunately,
that
did
not
happen
to
frank
chambers.
as
the
record
shows,
we
know
that
he
was
visited
during
the
five-month
period
that
he
was
lodged
in
a
county
jail
by
an
investigator
from
the
legal
aid
society
that
the
investigator
did
prepare
report
that
was
reduced
into
writing
and
was
placed
in
a
file.
but
the
file
was
subsequently
turned
over
to
mr.
tamburo
who
was
to
represent
chambers
on
the
day
of
trial.
ms.
carol
mary
los
your
honor,
it's
in
the
record
by
virtue
of
allegations
made
in
response
to
the
habeas
corpus
petition
filed
in
the
state
court.
unfortunately,
what
happened
to
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
was
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
then
withdrew
the
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
consequently,
the
matter
was
never
before
the
court,
the
commonwealth
was
not
required
to
go
forward
with
its
burden
of
proof
or
to
present
mr.
tamburo
or
to
offer,
in
fact
any
files
or
records
from
the
legal
aid
society.
consequently,
there
is
nothing
actually
on
the
record
before
your
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
it
was
presented
to
the
state
court
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
--
and
withdrawn.
however,
your
honor
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
judge
their
felt
that
since
the
petitioner
himself
had
raised
it
that
it
should
be
considered
again
by
him.
ms.
carol
mary
los
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
feel
that
if
that
is
the
case,
if
petitioner
was
not
waiving
it
at
the
time
that
it
did
not
exhaust
the
state
revenues
and
the
question
actually
should
be
before
the
state
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
by
virtue
of
his
counsel
when
the
commonwealth
attempted
to
cross-examine
chambers
about
the
length
of
time
that
he
had
--
had
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
mr.
tamburo.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that
is
our
point
your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
they
with
--
if
there
is
anything
lacking
in
the
record,
then
it
is
likely
by
virtue
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
at
the
time
withdrawing
the
allegation
and
consequently
the
commonwealth
then
stopped
its
line
of
questioning
with
the
petitioner
on
this
lines
and
did
not
present
any
affirmative
evidence
to
share
the
petitioner
had
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
this
case
with
mr.
tamburo.
in
any
event,
i
think
we
can
tell
from
the
record
that
mr.
tamburo
was
very
much
aware
of
the
facts
of
the
mistrial
that
it
occurred
three
weeks
prior
and
was
certainly
very
much
aware
of
the
evidence
that
have
been
admitted
at
the
previous
trial.
chambers
now
shows
that
the
near
fact
that
he
didn't
get
to
consult
with
mr.
tamburo
for
longer
period
of
time
warrants
a
new
trial.
in
the
past,
in
our
circuit
in
the
state
courts
when
an
allegation
of
this
nature
is
made,
it
is
merely
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
overall
test
of
effectiveness
of
counsel.
in
other
words,
the
burden
remains
with
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
he
was
prejudiced
because
of
the
belated
appointment.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
sir.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
it's
in
printed
at
the
appendix.
that's
it.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
it
does
it
sets
it
forth
for
you.
now,
this
is
--
generally,
this
is
the
pennsylvania
rule.
in
other
words,
the
prisoner
--
the
petitioner
would
have
to
show
that
the
appointment
was
made
in
bad
faith
as
being
merely
perfunctory
prior
to
trial
or
that
he
was
actually
prejudiced.
this
is
the
decision,
i
believe,
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
seeks
to
bring
before
you
in
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
this
position
while
we
are
certainly
happy
to
have
the
work
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
goes
beyond
the
position
that
we
are
taken
because
we
feel
that
as
far
as
the
facts
of
the
apparent
--
this
criminal
law
in
allegheny
county
is
concerned
that
the
facts
especially
in
this
case
might
warrant
the
presumption
that
the
third
circuit
has
given
in
cases
of
belated
appointment.
for
one
thing,
there
is
certainly
a
great
hesitancy
among
the
judiciary
to
judge
defense
counsel's
work
especially,
if
the
judge
has
himself
appointed
defense
counsel
to
represent
an
instant
defendant.
and
again,
there
is
a
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
the
defense
counsel
to
say
that
he
actually
was
ineffective
or
was
inadequately
prepared.
of
course,
where
he
has
not
asked
for
a
continuance
of
the
case
based
upon
these
facts,
it
would
be
i
think,
more
embarrassing
for
him
to
admit
that
he
was
inadequately
prepared.
and
third,
of
course
the
prisoner
lacking
any
legal
knowledge
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
judge
his
attorney's
competence.
now
the
problem
is
aggravated
in
allegheny
county
in
pittsburgh
because
there,
unless
the
case
is
a
murder
case
or
involves
an
extensive
string
of
armed
robberies,
counsel
is
appointed
ahead
of
time,
it
is
the
public
defender's
office
who
is
appointed
and
an
investigator
does
a
preparatory
work.
but
unfortunately,
the
prisoner
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
his
counsel
sometimes
even
just
prior
to
going
into
the
courtroom.
usually
counsel,
defense
counsel
will
visit
the
prisoner
in
the
bullpen
which
is
located
below
the
courtrooms
on
the
morning
of
trial.
but
unfortunately,
in
most
situations,
i
must
admit
the
counsel
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
his
client
until
just
moments
before
the
trial
begins.
ms.
carol
mary
los
he
does
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
that
is
true
your
honor.
well,
that
it
is
--
that
is
very
possible
that
that
particular
counsel
would
not
have
filed
one.
the
investigator
of
course
prepares
the
facts
and
these
facts
are
available
to
trial
counsel.
he
does
not
get
to
confer
with
his
client
but
there
was
a
previous
conference
done
by
an
investigator
from
the
public
defender's
staff.
here,
the
trial
judge
specifically
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
--
specifically
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
the
record
is
unclear
on
that.
i
would
presume
that
it
was
done
by
counsel.
ms.
carol
mary
los
not
this.
all
we
know,
your
honor,
is
that
he
did
not
confer
with
his
client
prior
to
that
morning.
he
may
possibly
have
had
the
case
prior
to
that
but
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
because
here
the
state
judge
as
well
as
the
federal
judges
all
ruled
in
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence
anyway
despite
the
fact
that
no
pretrial
motions
were
filed.
in
other
words,
they
granted
the
fact
they
should
have
been
filed
but
nonetheless
say,
we
will
rule
specifically
on
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence.
ms.
carol
mary
los
at
the
first
trial,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
bullets
were
not
admitted
into
evidence
and
i
presume
the
counsel
then
mr.
tamburo
that
is
would
have
relied
upon
that.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
--
with
that
because
we
did
not
have
a
copy
of
that
until
the
weekend,
your
honor.
so
i
do
not
have
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
right.
ms.
carol
mary
los
right
but
not
the
bullets.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
of
course.
ms.
carol
mary
los
we,
--
as
i
say,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
anything
as
a
matter
of
record
to
bring
before
you
on
those
points
and
i
would
presume
that
there
was
ample
time.
ms.
carol
mary
los
that's
very
true
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and
again,
i
say
that
the
commonwealth
did
not
have
to
go
forward
with
the
evidence
in
this
particular
matter.
we
will
concede
though
that
the
rule
in
the
circuit
which
braces
the
presumption
should
be
applicable
to
cases
of
this
nature.
especially
in
lieu
of
the
allegheny
county
situation
and
the
circuit
judge,
david
stowe,
who
ruled
on
this
case
was
from
allegheny
county
was
quite
familiar,
i
believe,
with
this
situation.
ms.
carol
mary
los
it
raises
the
presumption
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
from
the
fact
the
counsel
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
confer
with
this
client
prior
to
trial,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
there
was
no
investigation
at
all
into
this
matter.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
counsel
specifically
stated
when
an
assistant
district
attorney
attempted
to
cross-examine
chambers,
his
defense
counsel
got
up
and
said
we
want
it
to
be
made
clear
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
challenging
the
effectiveness
of
counsel.
ms.

this
was
a
mr.

of

ms.

that
is
true
your
honor.
however,
an
investigator
from
the
public
defender's
office
has
previously
conferred
with
the
defendant.
and
has
prepared
a
file,
you
know,
if
there
are
matters
which
should
be
raised

in
addition,
if
there

in
this
case.
ms.
carol

it
was
not
raised
until
the
state
habeas

and
i
believe
that
was
a
matter
of
almost
two
years
later.
it
was
not
raised.
ms.
carol
mary

pardon,
sir?
ms.
carol

it
was
approximately,
i
believe
two
years
later
that
it
was
raised.
it
was
not
raised
by
way
of
post
trial
motions
and
it
was
not
raised
on
a
direct
appeal.
ms.
carol
mary
los
we
don't
have
a
record
of
that,
your
honor.
i
would
presume
that
he
--
our
state
procedure
does
call
for
that
right
and
he
would
be
certainly
allowed
to
say
anything
that
he
wished
on
his
own
behalf.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
and
i
presume
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
made
a
matter
of
record
so
that
we
might
have
it
to
bring
for
your
court.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
the
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
the
third
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
where
it
may
grant
a
presumption
to
the
defendant.
if
he
can
prove
that
he
only
met
his
counsel
very
shortly
before
trial
that
a
presumption
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
would
be
raised.
ms.
carol
mary
los
and
in
allegheny
county,
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
--
the
percentage
would
be
even
greater,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
he
says
that
he
was
actually
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
file
this
pretrial
motions
and
i
as
i've
suggested
to
you
he
was
not
prejudiced
because
in
fact
the
trial
judge,
as
well
as
the
federal
district
court
judge
and
the
circuit
court
judge
discussed
those
--
the
admission
of
the
evidence
right
on
the
merits
so
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
prejudiced
by
that.
he
says
he
is
prejudiced
because
he
did
not
receive
a
severance
from
the
other
defendants.
and
he
cites
the
fact
that
raymond
lawson
had
previously
been
tried
on
a
murder
charge.
in
fact,
i
eventually
say
that
the
other
defendants
were
prejudiced
by
being
tried
with
him
because
he
was
the
one
that
was
identified
as
being
the
gunman
at
the
two
robberies.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
i
believe
that
in
answering
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
(voice
overlap)
he
went,
it
was
raised
there.
so
he
answered
that,
i
believe.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
you
should
find
that
indeed
the
petitioner
had
not
waived
his
right
to
raise
that
point.
and
that
the
record
--
that
even
though
his
counsel
might
have
done
so
if
he
had
not
joined
in
that,
that
the
allegation
would
still
stand
and
the
record
was
inadequate
for
either
the
state
habeas
corpus
judge
to
rule
on
it
and
any
of
the
federal
judges,
then
i
feel
i'm
force
to
say
it
must
be
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
you
find
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
state
judge
and
the
federal
judges,
even
if
he
had
not
waived
it,
then
hearing
is
unnecessary.
ms.
carol

the
circuit

in

case

which
we

cited

brief.

been
cited
by

as
well
as
by

ms.
carol
mary

no,
your
honor
it
is
not.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
it
was
not
in
effect
i
believe
until
1967
and
that
was
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
--
i
believe
it
is
their
position,
that
this
--
that
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
is
a
question
which
does
depend
upon
retroactivity
for
its
existence.
in
other
words,
this
is
fundamental
to
a
defendant's
due
process
of
law
and
an
indigent
defendant's
equal
protection
laws
consequently
it
would
not
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
that
may
very
well
be
true,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
certainly
as
far
as
the
--
as
their
client
is
concerned
that
they
are
in
a
rather
precarious
position.
in
other
words,
once
the
state
has
appointed
counsel
for
someone
and
that
particular
counsel
chooses
not
to
prepare
the
case
and
in
effect
renders
ineffective
assistance
to
counsel,
or
counsels
appointed
by
the
state
merely
is
a
perfunctory
gesture
so
there
is
not
sufficient
time
to
prepare,
then
certainly,
i
think
that
it
is
our
duty
whether
it's
a
persecutor
saying
or
defense
counsel
or
the
court
to
step
in
and
to
rectify
that
situation.
ms.

there's
absolutely
nothing
to

co-defendant
have
been
previously
tried
on
a
murder
charge

that
if
they
have
known
this,
they
never
would
have
wanted
lawson
to
be
able
to
testify
his
own
behalf,
because
he
apparently
does
not
make
a
very
credible
witness.
it
is
our
position
that
anyone
of
the
co-defendants
might
have
been
more
prejudiced
by
being
tried
with
chambers
and
vice
versa
because
of
the
four
of
them
chambers
was
the
one
that
was
absolutely
identified
as
the
gunman
in
the
two
different
robberies.
consequently,
we
don't
feel
that
there's
anything
at
all
that
would
have
aided
chambers
by
being
severed
in
the
two
cases.
ms.

yes,
your

it
is
true.
ms.

that
is
his
argument
and
our
answer
to
that
of
course
is
that
judge
actually
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
merits
as
did
the
federal

who
later
have
an
opportunity
to
review
this.
ms.

was
a
motion,

ms.

at

a
motion
was
made
an
objection.
ms.

the

judge
in
answering
said
you
should
have
filed
a
motion
to
suppress

then
he
said
however,
i
don't

that
this
is
evidence
which

be
suppressed
consequently
i
will
overrule
your

ms.

shifts
to

ms.

then
the
--
ms.

as
far
the

were
concerned
that

not
in
evidence
at
the
time.
ms.
carol
mary

if
i
may
explain,
your
honor.
initially,
there
were
two
objections
made
at
trial.
one
was
to
the
evidence
found
when
the
car
at
the
search
of
the
car.
the
other
was
made
to
the
bullets
that
were
seized
at
the
petitioner's
home.
as
far
as
the
original
one
was
concerned,
an
objection
was
made
to
the
admission
of
that
at
trial
not
a
formal
motion
to
suppress
but
instead
an
objection
to
the
evidence
that
had
already
been
admitted
into
evidence.
ms.
carol
mary

no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
they
did
not.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
i
am
not
your
honor,
i
am
saying
though.
that
if
the
judge
has
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
at
the
time
at
the
judge
ruled
on
them,
yes,
the
motion
was
made
before
the
court.
the
trial
judge
said,
i
will
hear
the
evidence
as
far
as
the
bullets
are
concerned.
as
soon
as
when
he
heard
the
evidence,
he
ruled
they
were
admissible.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
he
did
not
at
that
particular
time.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary

because,
your
honor,
he
has
before
him
the
warrant
and
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
who
served
that
warrant
and
who
searched
the
house.
ms.
carol
mary

yes,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
he
can
make
a
judgment
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
based
upon
that.
ms.
carol
mary
los
your
honor,
he
did
not
make
an
attempt
to
do
so
and
later
he
didn't
offer
any
defense.
consequently,
i
would
presume
that
he
didn't
have
anybody
available
to
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
an
objection
was
made
initially
to
the
evidence
that
was
found
when
the
car
was
searched
at
the
police
station.
it
was
--
ms.
carol
mary

two
revolvers,
two
guns
that
were
loaded,
there
was
a
glove
full
of
change
that
was
later
identified
as
being
taken
from
the
gulf
service
station
robbery,
there
was
several
cards,
identification
cards,
driver
licenses
that
were
taken,
credits
cards
that
were
taken
at
a
robbery
one
week
previous
to
that,
that
was
a
bore
on
station
robbery.
that
was
objected
to
at
trial
and
admitted
into
evidence.
then
counsel,
mr.
tamburo,
suggested
to
the
court
that
bullets
were
going
to
be
introduced
and
he
wanted
to
preclude
the
court
from
--
ms.

these
were
bullets
that
were
found
after
one
had
been
served
at
the
petitioner's
house
the
day
after
the
robbery.
it
was
in
the
morning
of
the
robbery,
a
police
officer
went
to
the
house,
he
went
to
the
houses
of
all
of
the
defendants

it
was
at

ms.

the
bullets
were
of
two
characters.
they
were
short
and
long
.38-caliber
bullets,
a
good
number
of
those
bullets
were
dumdum
bullets,
which
a
police
officer
testified
were
rather
rare
in
his
experience.
they

the
prosecution
then
placed
into
evidence,
the
two
revolvers
that
were
seized
from
the
car
in
which
the

riding.
these

bullets

was

ms.
carol
mary

at
the
first
--
as
involves
the
first
robbery
there
was
only
one
witness,
the
fellow
who
was
robbed,
the
gas
station
tenant.
he
positively
identified
him.
at
the
--
for
the
second
robbery,
the
fellow
who
was
robbed
stated
that
he
was
unable
to
identify
him
in
court
because
his
physical
appearance
was
somewhat
changed.
he
had
a
different
--
it
was
different
clothing,
he
was
now
wearing
glasses,
he
had
shaved
the
moustache
that
he
was
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
however,
he
did
identify
him
within
hours
of
the
robbery
as
being
the
person
who
--
the
gunman,
who
would
come
in
to
rob
him.
so,
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
eyewitness
testimony
that
we
have.
the
teenagers
who
observed
the
car
circling
the
area,
a
car
which
contained
four
negro
occupants,
one
was
wearing
a
dark
green
pullover
v-neck
sweater,
and
another
was
wearing
a
light
trench
coat.
and
we
know
from
the
fellow
who
was
robbed
that
one
of
the
gunman
was
wearing
a
v-neck
sweater
and
another
was
wearing
a
light
tan
trench
coat.
of
course,
we
have
no
eyewitness
testimony
from
the
two
teenagers
who
observed
this
car
because
they
couldn't
identify
anyone
who
was
in
the
car
other
than
their
race
and
their
dress,
and
they
did
not
observe
the
robbery.
i
would
like,
just
for
a
moment,
if
i
may
to
reach
the
question
of
the
search
that
was
conducted
at
the
police
station.
certainly,
if
chimel
is
retroactive,
then
i
must
concede
this
argument.
but
it
is
our
position,
at
the
time
that
the
police
officers
acted
that
the
test
must
be
the
reasonable
of
the
search
that
they
made,
they
couldn't
search
the
car.
ms.
carol

pardon?
ms.
carol

we
believe
that
preston
is
merely
an
extension
of

in

that
our

if
we

placed
themselves
in

of
the

the
fact

dangerous
for

a
reason
for

crime

here,
the
fact

this
was
the
escape
automobile.

in

trial
on
serious
criminal
charges

in
any
charges

he
has
had
adequate

discuss
his
case

counsel.
but
certainly
counsel
shouldn't
be
forced
to
represent
the
man
with
only
a
few
moments
notice.
this
we
feel
destroys
any
semblance
of
the
attorney-client
relationship,
because
not
only
does
it
land
itself
to
the
fact
that
the
attorney
might
not
be
adequately
prepared
but
also
he
may
likely
in
conation
to
act
as
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
his
client.
fortunately,
that
did
not
happen
to
frank
chambers.
as
the
record
shows,
we
know
that
he
was
visited
during
the
five-month
period
that
he
was
lodged
in
a
county
jail
by
an
investigator
from
the
legal
aid
society
that
the
investigator
did
prepare
report
that
was
reduced
into
writing
and
was
placed
in
a
file.
but
the
file
was
subsequently
turned
over
to
mr.

who
was
to
represent
chambers
on
the
day
of
trial.
ms.

your

it's
in
the
record
by
virtue
of
allegations
made
in
response
to
the
habeas
corpus
petition
filed
in
the
state
court.
unfortunately,
what
happened
to
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
was
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
then
withdrew
the
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
consequently,
the
matter
was
never
before

the

was
not
required
to
go
forward
with
its
burden
of
proof
or
to
present
mr.

to
offer,
in
fact
any
files
or

however,
your

the
federal
district
court.
the

their

had

should
be
considered
again

ms.

case,
if
petitioner
was
not
waiving
it
at
the
time
that
it
did
not
exhaust
the
state
revenues
and
the
question
actually
should
be
before
the
state
court.
ms.
carol
mary

by
virtue
of
his
counsel
when
the
commonwealth
attempted
to
cross-examine
chambers
about
the
length

he
had

had
an
opportunity
to
speak

ms.

that
is
our
point
your

we
are
saying
that
they
with
--
if
there
is
anything
lacking
in
the
record,
then
it
is
likely
by
virtue
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner

the
time
withdrawing
the

consequently
the

then
stopped
its

this

with
mr.

in
any
event,
i
think
we
can
tell
from

that
mr.

was
very
much
aware
of
the
facts
of
the
mistrial
that
it
occurred
three
weeks
prior
and
was
certainly
very
much
aware
of
the
evidence
that
have
been
admitted
at
the
previous
trial.
chambers
now
shows
that
the
near
fact
that
he
didn't
get
to
consult
with
mr.
tamburo
for
longer
period
of

warrants
a
new
trial.
in
the
past,
in
our
circuit
in
the
state

when
an
allegation
of
this
nature
is
made,
it
is
merely
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
overall
test
of
effectiveness
of
counsel.
in
other
words,
the
burden
remains
with
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
he
was
prejudiced
because
of
the
belated
appointment.
ms.

now,
this

--
generally,
this

the
pennsylvania

in
other
words,
the
prisoner
--
the
petitioner
would
have
to
show
that
the
appointment
was
made
in
bad
faith
as
being
merely
perfunctory
prior
to
trial
or
that
he
was
actually
prejudiced.
this
is
the
decision,
i
believe,
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
seeks
to
bring
before
you
in
the
amicus

in
this
case.
this
position
while
we
are
certainly
happy
to
have
the

facts
of
the
apparent
--
this
criminal
law
in
allegheny
county
is
concerned
that
the
facts
especially
in
this
case
might
warrant
the
presumption
that
the
third
circuit
has
given
in
cases
of
belated
appointment.
for
one
thing,
there
is
certainly
a
great
hesitancy
among
the
judiciary
to
judge
defense
counsel's
work
especially,
if
the
judge
has
himself
appointed
defense
counsel
to
represent
an
instant
defendant.
and
again,
there
is
a
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
the
defense
counsel
to
say
that
he
actually
was
ineffective
or
was
inadequately
prepared.
of
course,
where
he
has
not
asked
for
a
continuance
of
the
case
based
upon
these
facts,
it
would
be
i
think,
more
embarrassing
for
him
to
admit
that
he
was
inadequately
prepared.
and
third,
of
course
the
prisoner
lacking
any
legal
knowledge
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
judge
his
attorney's
competence.
now
the
problem
is
aggravated
in
allegheny
county
in
pittsburgh
because
there,
unless
the
case
is
a
murder
case
or
involves
an
extensive
string
of
armed
robberies,
counsel
is
appointed
ahead
of
time,
it
is
the
public
defender's
office
who
is
appointed
and
an
investigator
does
a
preparatory
work.
but
unfortunately,
the
prisoner
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
his
counsel
sometimes
even
just
prior
to
going
into
the
courtroom.
usually
counsel,
defense
counsel
will
visit
the
prisoner
in
the
bullpen
which
is
located
below
the
courtrooms
on
the
morning
of
trial.
but
unfortunately,
in
most
situations,
i
must
admit
the
counsel
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
his
client
until
just
moments
before
the
trial
begins.

well,
that
it
is
--
that
is
very
possible
that
that
particular
counsel
would
not
have
filed
one.
the
investigator
of
course
prepares
the
facts
and
these
facts
are
available
to
trial
counsel.
he
does
not
get
to
confer
with
his
client
but
there
was
a
previous
conference
done
by
an
investigator
from
the
public
defender's
staff.
here,
the
trial
judge
specifically
--
ms.

the

is
unclear

not
this.
all
we
know,
your
honor,
is
that
he
did
not
confer
with
his
client
prior
to
that
morning.
he
may
possibly
have
had
the
case
prior
to
that
but
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
because
here
the
state
judge
as
well
as
the
federal
judges
all
ruled
in
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence
anyway
despite
the
fact
that
no
pretrial
motions
were
filed.
in
other
words,
they
granted
the
fact
they
should
have
been
filed
but
nonetheless
say,
we
will
rule
specifically
on
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence.
ms.
carol
mary

at
the
first
trial,
your

i
believe
the
bullets
were
not
admitted
into
evidence

i
presume
the
counsel

mr.

that
is
would
have
relied
upon
that.

familiar

with

the

ms.

we
don't
have
anything
as
a
matter

bring

on
those
points

i
would
presume
that
there
was
ample
time.
ms.
carol

that's
very
true
it
is
not,
your

and
again,
i
say
that
the
commonwealth
did
not
have
to
go
forward
with
the
evidence
in
this
particular
matter.
we
will
concede
though
that
the
rule
in
the
circuit
which
braces
the
presumption
should
be
applicable
to
cases
of
this
nature.
especially
in

of
the
allegheny

situation
and
the
circuit

david

quite
familiar,
i

with
this
situation.
ms.

it
raises
the
presumption
of
ineffective

of

from
the
fact
the

confer
with
this
client
prior

your

ms.

stated
when
an
assistant

to
cross-examine

and

we

to

however,
an

with

ms.

we
don't
have
a
record
of
that,

i

that
he

our
state

does
call
for
that
right

he
would
be
certainly
allowed
to
say
anything
that
he
wished
on
his
own
behalf.
ms.
carol

yes,
and
i
presume
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
made
a
matter
of

so
that
we
might
have
it
to
bring
for
your
court.
ms.
carol
mary

yes,
the
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
the
third
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
where
it
may
grant
a
presumption
to
the
defendant.
if
he
can
prove
that
he
only
met
his
counsel
very
shortly
before
trial
that
a
presumption
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
would
be
raised.
ms.
carol
mary

and
in
allegheny

i
am
afraid
it
would
be
--
the
percentage
would
be
even
greater,
your

ms.

that
is
correct,
your

that's
correct.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
he
says
that
he
was
actually
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
file
this
pretrial
motions
and
i
as
i've
suggested
to
you
he
was
not
prejudiced
because
in
fact
the
trial
judge,
as
well
as
the
federal
district
court
judge
and
the
circuit
court
judge
discussed
those
--
the
admission
of
the
evidence
right
on
the
merits
so
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
prejudiced
by
that.
he
says
he
is
prejudiced
because
he
did
not
receive
a
severance
from
the
other
defendants.
and
he
cites
the
fact
that
raymond
lawson
had
previously
been
tried
on
a
murder
charge.
in
fact,
i
eventually
say
that
the
other
defendants
were
prejudiced
by
being
tried
with
him
because
he
was
the
one
that
was
identified
as
being
the
gunman
at
the
two
robberies.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
i
believe
that
in
answering
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
(voice
overlap)
he
went,
it
was
raised
there.
so
he
answered
that,
i
believe.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
you
should
find
that
indeed
the
petitioner
had
not
waived
his
right
to
raise
that
point.
and
that
the
record
--
that
even
though
his
counsel
might
have
done
so
if
he
had
not
joined
in
that,
that
the
allegation
would
still
stand
and
the
record
was
inadequate
for
either
the
state
habeas
corpus
judge
to
rule
on
it
and
any
of
the
federal
judges,
then
i
feel
i'm
force
to
say
it
must
be
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
you
find
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
state
judge
and
the
federal
judges,
even
if
he
had
not
waived
it,
then
hearing
is
unnecessary.
ms.
carol

the

i

in

case

ex

which
we

cited

well
as
by

ms.
carol
mary

no,
your
honor
it
is
not.
ms.
carol
mary

no,
it
was
not

i
believe
until
1967
and
that
was
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
--
i
believe
it
is
their
position,
that
this
--
that
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
is
a
question
which
does
depend
upon
retroactivity
for
its
existence.
in
other
words,
this
is
fundamental
to
a
defendant's
due
process
of
law
and
an
indigent
defendant's
equal
protection
laws
consequently
it
would
not
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
that
may
very
well
be
true,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
certainly
as
far
as
the
--
as
their
client
is
concerned
that
they
are
in
a
rather
precarious
position.
in
other
words,
once
the
state
has
appointed
counsel
for
someone
and
that
particular
counsel
chooses
not
to
prepare
the
case
and
in
effect
renders
ineffective
assistance
to
counsel,
or
counsels
appointed
by
the
state
merely
is
a
perfunctory
gesture
so
there
is
not
sufficient
time
to
prepare,
then
certainly,
i
think
that
it
is
our
duty
whether
it's
a
persecutor
saying
or
defense
counsel
or
the
court
to
step
in
and
to
rectify
that
situation.
ms.
carol
mary

no,
your
honor,
there's
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
not
an
effective
lawyer.
ms.
carol
mary

that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
the
allegations
made
--
ms.

no.
there
are
of
course
allegations
made
that
they

have

these
pretrial
motions.

not
make
a

absolutely
none.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
all.
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
they
argue
that
raymond
lawson,
a
co-defendant
have
been
previously
tried
on
a
murder
charge
and
that
if
they
have
known
this,
they
never
would
have
wanted
lawson
to
be
able
to
testify
his
own
behalf,
because
he
apparently
does
not
make
a
very
credible
witness.
it
is
our
position
that
anyone
of
the
co-defendants
might
have
been
more
prejudiced
by
being
tried
with
chambers
and
vice
versa
because
of
the
four
of
them
chambers
was
the
one
that
was
absolutely
identified
as
the
gunman
in
the
two
different
robberies.
consequently,
we
don't
feel
that
there's
anything
at
all
that
would
have
aided
chambers
by
being
severed
in
the
two
cases.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
true.
ms.
carol
mary

that
is
his
argument
and
our
answer
to
that
of
course
is
that
judge
actually
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
merits
as
did
the
federal
judges
who
later
have
an
opportunity
to
review
this.

was
made
an
objection.
ms.

the
trial
judge
in
answering
said
you
should
have
filed
a
motion
to

then
he
said

i

ms.

if
i
may
explain,
your

initially,

the
other
was

to

bullets

as
far
as
the
original
one
was
concerned,
an
objection
was
made
to
the
admission
of
that
at
trial
not
a
formal
motion
to
suppress
but
instead
an
objection
to
the
evidence
that
had
already
been
admitted
into

that
if

has
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
--
ms.

at
the
time
at
the
judge
ruled
on
them,

was
made
before

the
trial
judge
said,
i
will
hear
the
evidence
as
far
as

bullets
are
concerned.
as
soon
as
when
he
heard
the
evidence,
he
ruled
they
were
admissible.
ms.

no,
he
did
not
at
that
particular
time.
ms.
carol
mary
los
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
ms.

your
honor,
he
has
before
him
the

the
testimony
of

served
that
warrant
and
who
searched

ms.

make
a
judgment
as
to
the
admissibility

based
upon
that.

he
did
not
make
an
attempt
to
do

offer
any
defense.
consequently,
i
would
presume
that
he
didn't
have
anybody
available
to
--
ms.
carol
mary

an
objection
was
made
initially
to
the
evidence
that
was
found
when
the
car
was
searched
at
the
police
station.
it
was
--
ms.

loaded,

was

full
of

was
several

previous

that
was
objected
to

admitted
into

then
counsel,

to

bullets
were
going

of
two
characters.
they
were
short
and
long
.38-caliber
bullets,
a
good
number
of
those
bullets
were
dumdum
bullets,
which
a
police
officer
testified
were
rather
rare
in
his
experience.
they
--
the
prosecution
then
placed
into
evidence,
the
two
revolvers
that
were
seized
from
the
car
in
which
the
petitioner
was
riding.
these
two
--
the
bullets
from
those
guns
matched.
in
other
words
they
were
.38-caliber
long
and
short,
some
of
them
were
dumdum
bullets.
ms.

that
is
true,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary

that
was
the
object
of
admitting
them
into
evidence.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
were
found
in
the
petitioner's
home,
in
his
apartment.
ms.

his
apartment.
ms.
carol
mary

at
the
first
--
as
involves
the
first
robbery
there
was
only
one
witness,
the
fellow
who
was
robbed,
the
gas
station
tenant.
he
positively
identified
him.
at
the
--
for
the
second
robbery,
the
fellow
who
was
robbed
stated
that
he
was
unable
to
identify
him
in
court
because
his
physical
appearance
was
somewhat
changed.
he
had
a
different
--
it
was
different
clothing,
he
was
now
wearing
glasses,
he
had
shaved
the
moustache
that
he
was
wearing
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
however,
he
did
identify
him
within
hours
of
the
robbery
as
being
the
person
who
--
the
gunman,
who
would
come
in
to
rob
him.
so,
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
eyewitness
testimony
that
we
have.
the
teenagers
who
observed
the
car
circling
the
area,
a
car
which
contained
four
negro
occupants,
one
was
wearing
a
dark
green
pullover
v-neck
sweater,
and
another
was
wearing
a
light
trench
coat.
and
we
know
from
the
fellow
who
was
robbed
that
one
of
the
gunman
was
wearing
a
v-neck
sweater
and
another
was
wearing
a
light
tan
trench
coat.
of
course,
we
have
no
eyewitness
testimony
from
the
two
teenagers
who
observed
this
car
because
they
couldn't
identify
anyone
who
was
in
the
car
other
than
their
race
and
their
dress,
and
they
did
not
observe
the
robbery.
i
would
like,
just
for
a
moment,
if
i
may
to
reach
the
question
of
the
search
that
was
conducted
at
the
police
station.
certainly,
if
chimel
is
retroactive,
then
i
must
concede
this
argument.
but
it
is
our
position,
at
the
time
that
the
police
officers
acted
that
the
test
must
be
the
reasonable
of
the
search
that
they
made,
they
couldn't
search
the
car.
ms.
carol
mary
los
pardon?
ms.
carol
mary
los
we
believe
that
preston
is
merely
an
extension
of
the
reasonableness
rule
and
in
other
words,
that
our
facts,
if
we
can
differentiate
then
from
preston
would
be
acceptable
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
test
is
determined.
ms.
carol
mary
los
well
by
saying
this,
your
honor.
for
one
thing
the
--
we
maintain
that
this
was
a
search
incident
for
a
lawful
arrest,
that
the
search
that
was
made
at
the
police
station
was
substantially
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
ms.
carol
mary
los
a
very
short
time,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary

no,
we
don't
know
precisely.
ms.

taken
to
the
police
station.
ms.
carol
mary
los
yes,
you're
right,
your
honor.
they
were
inside
the
police
station.
i
can't
make
a
cooper
argument
and
say
while
the
police
were
just
attempting
to
inventory
the
car
or
to
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
right.
no,
they
could
not
reach
the
car
i
will
admit
that.
but
we
are
saying
that
the
police
officers
would
have
placed
themselves
in
danger
because
of
the
dark
circumstances
in
this
parking
lot,
the
fact
that
it
adjoined
a
bar
where
friends
of
the
petitioner
and
his
co-defendants
were
frequent.
ms.
carol
mary
los
when
they
search
it,
it
was
at
the
police
station.
they
took
it
by
virtue
of
having
lawson
drive
it
with
the
police
officer
to
the
station,
and
it
was
there
that
they
searched
it.
we
are
saying,
if
i
may
your
honor,
they
couldn't
search
it
in
the
dark
parking
lot.
it
was
too
dangerous
for
them,
the
member
of
policemen
that
they
have
there.
it
was
too
dark
to
be
able
to
search
the
car
effectively.
ms.
carol
mary
los
they
had
it
in
the
driveway
which
adjoined
the
police
station
--
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
because
your
honor,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
reason
for
nexus
between
the
crime
charged
here,
the
fact
that
this
was
the
escape
automobile.
whereas
in
preston,
there
was
no
connection
between
the
search
of
the
car
and
the
vagrancy
the
reason
why
the
men
were
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
it
is
your
honor,
yes
it
was.
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
that
is
a
test,
your
honor.
we
don't
feel
at
that
particular
time
is
a
test.
ms.
carol
mary
los
the
car
was
taken
your
honor
because
it
was
suspected
as
being
the
escape
vehicle.
certainly,
if
someone
would
have
come
to
claim
the
car
the
police
officers
could
not
have
detained
it.
ms.
carol
mary
los
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
would
--
i
would
say
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
--
i'm
saying
that
if
they
have
searched
the
car
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
if
they
had
not
begun
search
by
the
time
members
of
the
family
had
come
to
take
the
car,
i
would
presume
because
of
the
time
laps
there,
it
could
not
be
substantially
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
if
they
have
the
right
to
search
the
car,
the
right
extends
as
i
feel
--
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
your
honor,
we
know.
i
don't
rely
on
that
because
i
know
that
the
witnesses
could
not
specifically
identify
this
particular
automobile.
ms.
carol
mary
los
excuse
me,
your
honor?
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
mary
los
well,
yes
it
was,
but
as
far
as
seizing
it
for
purposes
of
evidence,
in
other
words,
having
at
been
identified
by
someone
as
being
the
getaway
car
we
could
not
do
that
because
we
know.
ms.
carol
mary

it
belonged
to
raymond
lawson
who
was
a
co-defendant
and
he
was
driving
the
automobile.
ms.
carol
mary
los
i
am
your
honor,
unfortunately,
it
does
escape
me
at
the
moment.
i
know
that
we
did
consider
it
we
chose
to
rely
on
dento

the

relied
