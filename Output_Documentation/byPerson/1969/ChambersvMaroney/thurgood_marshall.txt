justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
grogan,
i
understand
third
circuit's
opinion
was
that
they
applied
the
same
rule
as
the
standards
of
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
had
and
found
that
it
didn't
apply
in
this
case
so
they
did
--
would
you
admit
that
they
applied
the
right
standards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
the
real
problem
of
second
guessing
of
trial
lawyers
because
i
don't
know
about
you
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
when
i
went
back
over
record
of
the
case
i
tried,
i
found
considerable
fault
with
my
proceeding.
have
you
found
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
the
problem
i
see
in
this
case
is
of
second
guessing
in
trial
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
was
appointed
all
the
way
back,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
normal
procedure
to
appoint
the
law
you
represents
the
legal
aid
for
all
purposes
in
these
days
until
by
order
of
court
is
removed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
with
the
same
lawyer,
you
always
appoint
the
head
of
legal
aid
group,
isn't
that
the
way
you
do
in
pittsburgh?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
assigned
it
to
one
of
his
other
lawyers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
would
you
assume
that's
what
was
done
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wouldn't
you
assume
that
the
lawyer
was
appointed
before
that
day
of
the
argument?
i
mean
the
day
of
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
no,
i
understood
you
to
say
you
didn't
know
it.
all
you
knew
was
that
he
said
he
saw
him
on
the
hallway.
he
didn't
say
i
saw
him
to
the
first
time
in
the
hallway,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
(inaudible)
file
if
it's
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
withdrawn.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
ms.
loss,
the
petitioner
says
that
under
those
circumstances,
there's
no
way
under
the
sun
to
file
a
pretrial
motion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
who
made
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
who
made
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
file
pretrial
motions
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
record
is
clear
that
the
counsel
in
this
case
couldn't
have
decided
because
he
didn't
get
it
until
that
morning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
los,
was
it
on
--
in
pennsylvania,
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
is
the
defendant
allowed
to
put
on
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
motion
is
made
during
the
trial,
is
this
case
the
judge
said
no
evidence
is
in
yet,
right?
about
the
seizure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nothing
in
evidence
except
the
bullets.
and
the
judge
says,
you
should
have
made
this
motion
but
since
you
didn't
make
it
i
will
rule
on
it
that
the
motion
is
denied
without
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
they
ever
war
there
on
that?
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
you
are
not
telling
us
that
at
that
stage
a
motion
of
trial
is
the
same
as
the
motion
before
trial,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
were
it
merits,
the
bullets
were
there,
what
else
were
the
merits,
do
you
have
any
testimony
at
that
stage
as
to
how
the
bullets
received?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
hear
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
eh
hear
the
defendant's
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
could
he
rule
on
the
merits
when
he
only
heard
one
side?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
merits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
