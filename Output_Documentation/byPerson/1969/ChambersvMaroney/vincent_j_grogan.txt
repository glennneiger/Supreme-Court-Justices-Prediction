mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
kernel
matter
is
before
the
court
on
write
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
constitutional
questions
presented
are
whether
petitioner
was
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel
where
he
met
his
lawyer
on
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom
for
trial
on
serious
criminal
charges.
it
also
involves
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
warrantless
search
of
an
automobile
in
which
the
petitioner
was
a
passenger
which
was
made
while
he
was
in
custody
in
a
police
station
after
the
car
had
been
moved
from
the
scene
of
arrest
to
the
police
station
and
where
there
have
been
two
previous
searches
of
the
same
automobile.
it
also
involves
the
question
of
harmless
error
in
connection
with
the
admission
into
evidence
of
dumdum
bullets
which
were
illegally
seized
and
then
used
to
trial
to
connect
petitioner
with
weapons
that
were
found
in
the
warrantless
search
of
the
car
and
also
used
to
describe
the
severity
of
impact
that
could
be
made
by
such
bullets
two
petitioner
judgment.
the
statement
of
--
the
case
in
our
brief
is
extensive.
i'll
try
to
summarize
it
more
briefly
for
the
court.
it
opens
with
the
statement
within
the
first
week
of
september
1963,
petitioner
and
three
co-defendants
were
tried
on
fourth
criminal
charges.
i
find
now
since
the
time
of
preparation
in
my
brief
and
i've
advised
my
opponent
ms.
los
that
the
record
of
this
trial
has
become
available
to
me
and
that
trial
did
not
involve
four
criminal
charges
but
rather
two.
it
appears
that
the
indictment
that
was
presented
to
the
court
and
jury
in
that
case
involved
solely
the
alleged
robbery
of
the
service
station
on
may
28,
1963,
and
for
reasons
it
will
become
apparent
this
is
very
important
to
our
case.
i'd
like
to
offer
this
to
the
court
at
this
time.
at
the
trial
in
early
september
1963,
petitioner
was
represented
by
a
member
of
the
legal
aid
society
of
pittsburgh.
the
trial
ended
in
a
mistrial
and
withdrawal
of
a
juror
for
reasons
that
are
not
explained
in
this
record.
later
in
september,
on
september
27,
1963
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
your
honor
all
the
defendants
or
four
defendants
were
for
each
of
those
cases.
petitioner
was
called
again
to
trial
this
time
he
was
again
represented
by
member
of
legal
aid
society
of
pittsburgh.
it
happened
to
be
another
lawyer
not
the
one
who
represented
him
at
the
first
trial.
he
met
his
lawyer
in
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
discussions
they
were
before
that
if
any
with
his
lawyer,
they
proceeded
to
trial
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
the
record
isn't
clear
in
that
regard
whether
it
was
a
specific
appointment
or
not.
in
other
words,
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
there
was
an
order
of
court
entering
an
appearance
or
directing
the
legal
aid
society
to
appear.
in
further
answer
to
your
question
as
of
now
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
he
first
knew
at
that
morning,
your
honor,
apparently.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
say
that
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
all
we
know
and
we
know
that
because
of
the
statements
made
by
petitioner
at
the
--
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
i
believe
they
could
say
that
fairly,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
the
record
does
disclose
that
and
that's
all
that
we
have
to
deal
with
at
the
present
time,
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
those
assumptions
are
warranted
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
i
may
speak
outside
the
record,
i
believe
so.
i
have
obtained
copies
of
the
legal
aid
society,
files
in
connection
with
the
case
and
i
believe
that
which
show
very,
very
little
to
and
assist
the
lawyer
in
a
second
trial
of
the
same
charges.
additionally,
we
have
the
problem
here
that
we
have
been
--
i
have
been
operating
under
the
assumption
that
the
first
trial
involved
all
four
counts
where
as
we
find
now
that
it
only
involves
two
counts
for
one
of
the
two
robberies
that
he
was
charged
with
and
tried
in
september.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
held
in
the
state
court,
your
honor,
that
it
was
very
brief.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
i
did
not.
i
was
pointed
by
this
court
to
represent
petitioner.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
not
in
the
federal
system,
your
honor,
and
also
its
not
a
full
hearing.
part
of
our
contention
is
that
under
townsend
against
sain
there
was
not
an
adequate
fact-finding
hearing
by
the
state
court
that
the
material
facts
are
not
disclosed
in
this
record.
the
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
appears
in
the
appendix
and
it
shows
that
petitioner
took
the
stand
he
was
ask
when
he
met
his
counsel,
he
testified
that
he
met
him
in
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom.
he
was
not
asked
any
questions
in
connection
with
what
other
preparation
there
was
whether
he
discussed
it
with
him
or
not.
the
only
other
thing
touching
on
the
fact
was
that
petitioner
said
that
at
some
point
in
time
between
the
time
when
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
first
trial
that
a
member
of
the
legal
aid
society
staff
apparently
came
to
the
precinct
to
talk
to
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
the
trial
testimony
disclosed
that
on
may
13,
1963.
two
negroes
walked
into
a
service
station
and
demanded
all
of
the
money
that
the
service
station
operator
had.
one
of
them
displayed
a
pistol,
a
nickel-plated
pistol
and
they
received
from
the
service
station
operator
$66.00
in
cash,
some
personal
cards,
and
his
wallet.
at
the
trial,
the
service
station
operator
identified
petitioner
as
the
person
who
was
holding
the
gun.
he
made
an
in-court
identification
of
petitioner
and
identified
these
items
as
his
personal
property,
the
cards
and
also
the
wallet.
testimony
further
disclosed
that
around
11:30
o'clock
p.m.
on
may
the
20th,
two
teenagers
saw
a
car,
a
light
blue
station
wagon
parked
in
a
parking
lot
near
the
teenage
girl's
home,
in
it
were
seated
four
negro
gentlemen.
they
then
testified
that
they
saw
this
station
wagon
circled
the
block
around
the
teenage
girl's
residence
and
also
a
gulf
service
station.
subsequently,
about
15
minutes
later,
someone
ran
from
the
service
station
exclaiming
that
there
had
been
a
robbery.
they
then
saw
within
a
few
seconds
this
light
blue
station
wagon
leave
the
parking
lot
at
a
high
rate
of
speed.
the
record
shows
that
service
station
was
not
visible
from
the
parking
area,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
at
anytime,
the
--
anyone
ran
from
the
service
station
to
the
automobile,
got
out
of
the
automobile
or
in
any
other
fashion
connected
at
with
the
robbery.
the
service
station
attendant
testified
that
two
negro
gentlemen
came
into
the
service
station
both
of
them
displayed
pistols
and
demanded
everything
that
they
had.
one
of
them,
one
is
wearing
a
green
sweater,
the
other
was
wearing
a
trench
coat.
he
took
the
change
that
he
had
and
put
it
in
his
right
hand
glove,
the
service
station
attendant's
glove,
and
gave
it
to
the
two
robbers.
as
police
were
summoned
they
came.
they
interviewed
the
teenagers
and
the
service
station
attendant
and
a
description
of
the
car
and
the
four
occupants
were
put
--
or
was
put
on
the
police
radio.
approximately,
45
minutes
to
an
hour
later,
two
neighboring
or
two
police
officers
in
the
neighboring
community
saw
a
vehicle
that
answer
the
description
that
have
been
put
on
the
radio
and
that
is
it
was
a
light
blue
compact
station
wagon
occupied
by
four
negroes.
at
that
time,
the
station
wagon
was
being
operated
back
toward
the
scene
of
the
crime
of
that
evening
or
the
previous
evening.
the
police
officers
pulled
the
vehicle
over
on
a
side
street,
now
the
commonwealth
has
argued
that
there
may
be
inferences
here
leading
or
could
be
inferred
that
the
gentlemen
were
attempting
to
elude
the
police
at
the
time
but
i
do
no
think
that
that's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record.
but
in
any
event
they
were
pulled
over
in
the
parking
lot.
they
got
out
of
the
station
wagon
and
the
police
officers
first
looked
at
that
point
for
weapons.
within
moments,
other
police
officers
from
the
community
where
the
robbery
had
taken
place
came
to
the
scene.
at
that
time,
those
police
officers
look
through
the
station
wagon
by
means
of
searchlight.
petitioner
and
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
were
then
taken
to
the
police
station
in
the
community
where
the
robbery
had
occurred.
they
were
again
searched,
at
that
time
moment
or
that
moment,
money
was
removed
from
their
purses.
the
police
officers
went
outside
and
made
a
search
of
a
vehicle.
the
chief
of
police
or
the
lieutenant
who
was
in-charge
testified
that
they
went
through
everything
to
indicate
the
depth
of
the
search.
they
went
back
inside
after
finding
nothing
again
questioned
petitioner
and
the
lawson,
one
of
the
other
co-defendants
went
back
out
again.
and
in
this
third
search
of
the
car,
one
of
the
officers
opened
up
a
bin
in
the
heater
and
from
this
bin
he
removed
two
pistols,
the
cards
taken
in
the
robbery
of
may
the
13th
and
a
personal
wallet
of
the
attendant
of
that
earlier
event.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
they
don't
say
its
explicitly,
your
honor,
what
they
do
assert
is
that
they
went
through
everything
and
found
nothing
and
it
appears
as
if
what
they
did
then
was
to
go
back
in
and
further
interrogate
or
attempt
to
interrogate
to
disclose
information.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
appendix
to
indicate
that.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
matter
of
continuity
is
a
little
hard
to
explain,
your
honor,
because
of
the
passage
of
time
that
must
be
on
inferred
from
the
testimony
of
the
officers
as
to
how
the
search
went
on.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
appears
as
if
this
was
the
only
thing
they
were
engaged
in,
mr.
chief
justice.
later
that
same
morning,
then
the
chief
of
police
of
the
community
obtained
a
search
warrant
and
went
to
the
homes
of
the
four
defendants
and
made
a
search.
in
the
homes
of
the
three
other
defendants
nothing
was
found.
he
went
to
petitioner's
residence
and
there
found
a
holster,
some
dumdum
bullets
that
were
matched
to
one
of
the
revolvers
found
in
the
search
of
the
car.
at
the
trial,
petitioner's
counsel
objected
to
the
introduction
of
these
dumdum
bullets
into
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
irrelevancy
at
first,
this
was
overruled.
then
the
police
officer
testified
on
the
stand
that
the
dumdum
bullets
matched
one
of
the
--
matched
the
bullets
taken
from
one
of
the
weapons
and
that
the
effect
of
the
dumdum
bullet
on
the
human
body
is
to
make
larger
holes
and
to
cause
more
tissue
damage.
petitioner's
counsel
again
objected.
this
time
he
objected
on
the
grounds
that
the
search
warrant
did
not
disclose
or
did
not
indicate
what
they
were
searching
for
and
it
did
not
specifically
say
what
they
were
searching
for.
unfortunately,
this
search
warrant
is
not
available
to
us
now.
it
has
been
lost,
it's
not
a
matter
of
this
record,
it
apparently
was
lost
before
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearings,
and
so
we
are
unable
to
say
at
the
present
time
exactly
what
the
search
warrant
did
disclose
except
for
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
when
he
was
on
stand
who
said
that
the
search
warrant
did
not
indicate
that
they
were
looking
for
bullets.
in
any
event,
petitioner's
then
counsel
objection
to
this
evidence
was
overruled
by
the
court
who
said
that
his
failure
to
file
pretrial
motions
meant
that
the
suppression
evidence
should
have
been
heard
earlier
not
having
been
heard
it
was
overruled
on
those
procedure
grounds.
the
jury
returned
verdicts
convicting
the
four
defendants
of
the
crimes
of
may
20th
and
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
6
to
15
years
imprisonment.
about
two
years
after
his
conviction,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court
and
evidentiary
hearing
was
held,
and
i've
summarized
for
you
what
was
disclosed
at
that
time
that
he
met
his
counsel
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom
for
the
trial.
there
is
no
extensive
discussion
as
to
what
preparation
if
any
there
was,
there
was
no
exploration
as
to
what
defenses
were
available
merely
those
statements.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
i
think
the
basic
proposition
which
start
with
the
things
disclosed
by
the
record
and
they
would
be
that
in
the
first
instance
the
trial
court
in
overruling
the
objections
to
the
dumdum
bullets
on
the
grounds
that
there
had
not
been
a
pretrial
motion
filed.
the
failure
of
counsel
to
recognize
the
very
valid
argument
in
connection
with
the
search
of
the
automobile
which
we
submit
to
this
court
at
this
time,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
pretrial
consultation
between
the
lawyer
and
his
colleagues
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
petitioner.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
doesn't
disclose
anything
except
in
this
record
that
i
now
have
before
the
court.
it
shows
there
that
there
were
other
objections
made
that
were
not
made
at
the
second
trial
for
other
reasons
that
apparently
were
not
known
to
the
lawyer
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
believe
they
are
material.
in
connection
with
argument
we
submit
that
the
late
appointment
of
counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
case
were
so
prejudicial
to
whom
as
to
warrant
reversal.
this
court
in
getting
gideon
against
wainwright
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
when
charged
with
a
serious
crime
is
a
fundamental
right
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principles
of
powell
against
alabama
where
the
court
said
that
this
right
was
not
a
hollow
one
but
it
meant
appointment
at
such
time
and
under
such
circumstances
as
to
give
effective
aid
of
counsel
in
the
preparation
and
trial
the
case.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
initially
we
argue
in
the
alternative
but
i
believe
that
it's
not
necessary
under
powell
against
alabama
and
gideon
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
to
show
specific
prejudice
that
it's
not
necessary
where
you
have
the
issue
of
the
right
to
counsel
to
show
specific
prejudice.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that's
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
what
we're
really
concerned
with
here
though
your
honor
is
not
so
much
second
guessing
the
techniques
of
trial
but
we
are
talking
about
those
factors
that
are
extrinsic
to
the
trial
itself.
in
other
words,
appointment
at
such
a
time
that
he
could
prepare
that
he
could
do
those
things
it
will
lead
to
affective
assistance
to
counsel.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
we
can
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it's
not
necessarily
the
same
lawyers.
as
a
matter
of
practice
it's
not
necessarily
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
generally
speaking,
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
legal
aid
society,
your
honor,
may
have
been
appointed
as
such
but
he
never
met
the
lawyer
that
was
to
represent
him,
his
personal
counsel,
until
the
morning
of
trial.
this
is
what
the
record
discloses.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
think
he
did,
your
honor.
yes,
i
believe
he
did.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
we
submit
that
under
powell
against
the
alabama
that
the
components
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
should
have
been
provided
and
those
would
be
the
opportunity,
prepare
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
defenses,
to
interview
witnesses,
to
file
pretrial
motions.
none
of
these
things
could
have
been
done
by
petitioner
here.
we
can
say
that
the
legal
aid
society
may
have
been
appointed
but
what
we
have
to
speak
in
terms
of
is
the
effect
of
this
that
the
personal
counsel
that
was
furnished
to
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
were
none
filed.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
time
to
do
it.
in
other
cases
this
court
has
not
considered
the
possibility
of
prejudice
in
connection
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
glasser
against
united
states,
for
example,
where
the
court
determined
that
it
would
not
inquire
into
the
degree
of
prejudice
sustained
by
one
who
had
not
had
the
assistance
of
counsel
unimpaired
by
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
would
like
to
continue,
if
you
please.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
a
question
in
connection
with
when
petitioner
first
met
his
counsel,
i
find
it
in
the
appendix
of
page
256
the
testimony
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
indicates
that
he
first
met
his
counsel
on
the
morning
of
trial.
it
states
it
quite
clearly.
in
my
remaining
time
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
our
argument
in
connection
with
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
as
adopted
in
this
case
is
erroneous
that
for
the
reason
that
i
--
we
do
not
believe
that
you
must
show
specific
prejudice
in
order
to
warrant
reversal.
we
point
to
the
case
as
this
court
has
considered
in
connection
with
recidivist
proceedings
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
procedures.
but
in
any
event
if
you
assume
the
validity
of
the
rule
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
which
shifts
the
burden
to
the
prosecuting
authorities
to
show
that
there
was
not
any
prejudice
from
the
lay
appointment
of
counsel
that
this
rule
doesn't
fall
to
the
teachings
of
this
court
as
indicated
in
the
case
of
chapman.
because
in
chapman,
this
court
said
that
before
you
can
declare
a
constitutional
error
to
be
harmless
the
court
must
expressly
believe
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
this
rule
as
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
talks
in
terms
of
overcoming
this
prima
facie
case
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
solely
by
adequate
affirmative
proof
and
we
submit
that
adequate
affirmative
proof
in
this
case
is
not
the
same
thing
as
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
as
in
this
case,
we
have
nothing
but
the
trial
record
before
us.
and
all
that
trial
record
discloses
is
what
was
done
or
what
may
have
been
counsel
may
have
been
able
to
do
within
the
confines
of
the
record
as
stated.
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
what
could
have
been
done
and
was
not
done,
what
counsel
may
have
to
consider
and
yet
did
not
take
any
action
upon.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
there
are
instances
where
even
if
you
assume
the
validity
of
the
rule
and
ignore
the
dictates
of
chapman,
that
there
is
specific
prejudice
indicated,
indicated
by
the
failure
of
counsel
for
example
to
forcefully
argue
for
severance
of
the
indictments
of
the
two
counts
in
connection
with
the
two
separate
robberies.
there
is
no
common
scheme.
the
only
thing
in
common
about
them
was
the
fact
that
the
fruits
of
the
robberies
were
found
at
the
same
time.
there
are
other
things
to
consider.
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
went
beyond
the
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
inquired
into
the
adequacy
of
counsel
solely
by
reference
to
the
record
of
the
trial.
nothing
was
done
here
to
develop
what
counsel
could
have
done
through
his
own
testimony,
this
case
unlike
any
other
case
that
we
could
find
counsel
did
not
testify.
counsel
was
not
called
to
testify
either
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearings
or
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
legal
aid
society
records
were
never
introduced.
petitioner
was
never
examined
in
detail
as
to
what
defenses
he
may
have
had.
the
testimony
the
petitioner
at
the
place
i've
indicated
in
the
record
covers
just
a
few
pages
and
centers
around
the
fact
that
he
met
his
counsel
on
that
morning.
there
is
no
explanation
for
the
failure
of
the
counsel
for
example
to
file
the
pretrial
motions
as
indicated
by
the
record,
this
thing
should
be
determined
and
can
only
be
done
so
by
following
the
dictates
of
townsend
against
sain
and
having
a
preliminary
hearing.
turning
to
the
search
and
seizure
problem
we've
argued
in
the
brief
if
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
i
believe
that
that
argument
is
set
forth
adequately
in
the
brief.
i
would
like
however
in
the
remaining
time
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
this
third
circuit
did
in
this
case
and
connection
with
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
preston
against
united
states.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
preston,
this
court
decided
that
where
a
person
is
lawfully
arrested,
a
warrantless
search
can
be
made
for
two
purposes.
to
find
weapons
to
prevent
the
person
from
escaping
or
from
injuring
the
apprehending
officer
and
also
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
any
evidence.
the
third
circuit
in
its
cases
united
states
against
dento
placed
two
additional
distinguishing
features
into
that
test.
and
said
that
you
can
nevertheless
validate
a
warrantless
search
where
the
search
was
substantially
contemporaneous
and
there
was
a
reasonable
nexus
between
the
offense
and
the
search.
neither
of
these
matters
were
part
of
the
preston
test
and
should
not
become
a
part
of
our
law.
we
have
indicated
to
the
court
in
our
brief
the
case
of
wood
against
crouse
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
ably
distinguishes
preston
or
ably
distinguishes
dento
and
indicates
its
failure
to
follow
the
dictates
of
preston.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
was
driven
by
the
owner,
lawson,
one
of
the
co-defendants.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
policeman
was
in
the
car
with
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
believe
they
have
the
right
to
take
the
car
some
place
else,
your
honor,
to
the
station
perhaps.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
question
whether
they
have
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
we
assume
that
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that
was
my
reason
for
saying,
to
get
it
off
the
street.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
that
would
be
all
that
they
could
do.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
nor
could
they
do
this,
do
the
things
that
they
did
in
this
case
which
was
to
conduct
after
they
have
taken
it
to
the
station
or
have
been
driven
to
the
station.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
can
just
take
it
to
the
station
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
get
it
off
the
street.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
can
move
it.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
why
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so
without
some
further
action.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
they
have
a
reason
to
believe,
your
honor,
but
they
could
have
got
themselves
a
warrant
in
the
time
or
left
someone
there
in
custody
of
the
car
or
have
a
police
officer
remain
with
the
car.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so
on
to
the
dictates
of
preston.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
they
are
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
preston
permits
the
search
then
and
there
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
to
prevent
the
suspects
from
getting
to
weapons.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
think
it
would
permit
when
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
cooper.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
of
presenting
the
case
to
the
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
we
also
considered
it.
i
frankly
at
this
point
don't
recall
what
our
reasons
where
when
we
prepared
the
brief
for
not
including
it.
if
i
may,
there
was
one
thing
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
in
connection
with
the
waiver
of
the
argument
on
the
infectiveness
of
counsel,
i
think
the
case
of
fay
against
noia
decided
by
this
court
would
have
to
indicate
that
there
have
been
a
knowing
waiver
and
here
counsel
made
this
gratuitous
statement
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
and
it
was
not
participated
in
by
the
defendant
in
any
fashion.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i'm
out
of
time.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
kernel
matter
is
before
the
court
on
write
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
constitutional
questions
presented
are
whether
petitioner
was
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel
where
he
met
his
lawyer
on
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom
for
trial
on
serious
criminal
charges.
it
also
involves
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
a
warrantless
search
of
an
automobile
in
which
the
petitioner
was
a
passenger
which
was
made
while
he
was
in
custody
in
a
police
station
after
the
car
had
been
moved
from
the
scene
of
arrest
to
the
police
station
and
where
there
have
been
two
previous
searches
of
the
same
automobile.
it
also
involves
the
question
of
harmless
error
in
connection
with
the
admission
into
evidence
of
dumdum
bullets
which
were
illegally
seized
and
then
used
to
trial
to
connect
petitioner
with
weapons
that
were
found
in
the
warrantless
search
of
the
car
and
also
used
to
describe
the
severity
of
impact
that
could
be
made
by
such
bullets
two
petitioner
judgment.
the
statement
of
--
the
case
in
our
brief
is
extensive.
i'll
try
to
summarize
it
more
briefly
for
the
court.
it
opens
with
the
statement
within
the
first
week
of
september
1963,
petitioner
and
three
co-defendants
were
tried
on
fourth
criminal
charges.
i
find
now
since
the
time
of
preparation
in
my
brief
and
i've
advised
my
opponent
ms.
los
that
the
record
of
this
trial
has
become
available
to
me
and
that
trial
did
not
involve
four
criminal
charges
but
rather
two.
it
appears
that
the
indictment
that
was
presented
to
the
court
and
jury
in
that
case
involved
solely
the
alleged
robbery
of
the
service
station
on
may
28,
1963,
and
for
reasons
it
will
become
apparent
this
is
very
important
to
our
case.
i'd
like
to
offer
this
to
the
court
at
this
time.
at
the
trial
in
early
september
1963,
petitioner
was
represented
by
a
member
of
the
legal
aid
society
of
pittsburgh.
the
trial
ended
in
a
mistrial
and
withdrawal
of
a
juror
for
reasons
that
are
not
explained
in
this
record.
later
in
september,
on
september
27,
1963
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
your
honor
all
the
defendants
or
four
defendants
were
for
each
of
those
cases.
petitioner
was
called
again
to
trial
this
time
he
was
again
represented
by
member
of
legal
aid
society
of
pittsburgh.
it
happened
to
be
another
lawyer
not
the
one
who
represented
him
at
the
first
trial.
he
met
his
lawyer
in
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
discussions
they
were
before
that
if
any
with
his
lawyer,
they
proceeded
to
trial
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
the
record
isn't
clear
in
that
regard
whether
it
was
a
specific
appointment
or
not.
in
other
words,
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
there
was
an
order
of
court
entering
an
appearance
or
directing
the
legal
aid
society
to
appear.
in
further
answer
to
your
question
as
of
now
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
he
first
knew
at
that
morning,
your
honor,
apparently.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
say
that
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
all
we
know
and
we
know
that
because
of
the
statements
made
by
petitioner
at
the
--
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
i
believe
they
could
say
that
fairly,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
the
record
does
disclose
that
and
that's
all
that
we
have
to
deal
with
at
the
present
time,
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
those
assumptions
are
warranted
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
i
may
speak
outside
the
record,
i
believe
so.
i
have
obtained
copies
of
the
legal
aid
society,
files
in
connection
with
the
case
and
i
believe
that
which
show
very,
very
little
to
and
assist
the
lawyer
in
a
second
trial
of
the
same
charges.
additionally,
we
have
the
problem
here
that
we
have
been
--
i
have
been
operating
under
the
assumption
that
the
first
trial
involved
all
four
counts
where
as
we
find
now
that
it
only
involves
two
counts
for
one
of
the
two
robberies
that
he
was
charged
with
and
tried
in
september.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
held
in
the
state
court,
your
honor,
that
it
was
very
brief.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
i
did
not.
i
was
pointed
by
this
court
to
represent
petitioner.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
not
in
the
federal
system,
your
honor,
and
also
its
not
a
full
hearing.
part
of
our
contention
is
that
under
townsend
against
sain
there
was
not
an
adequate
fact-finding
hearing
by
the
state
court
that
the
material
facts
are
not
disclosed
in
this
record.
the
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
appears
in
the
appendix
and
it
shows
that
petitioner
took
the
stand
he
was
ask
when
he
met
his
counsel,
he
testified
that
he
met
him
in
the
hallway
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom.
he
was
not
asked
any
questions
in
connection
with
what
other
preparation
there
was
whether
he
discussed
it
with
him
or
not.
the
only
other
thing
touching
on
the
fact
was
that
petitioner
said
that
at
some
point
in
time
between
the
time
when
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
first
trial
that
a
member
of
the
legal
aid
society
staff
apparently
came
to
the
precinct
to
talk
to
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
the
trial
testimony
disclosed
that
on
may
13,
1963.
two
negroes
walked
into
a
service
station
and
demanded
all
of
the
money
that
the
service
station
operator
had.
one
of
them
displayed
a
pistol,
a
nickel-plated
pistol
and
they
received
from
the
service
station
operator
$66.00
in
cash,
some
personal
cards,
and
his
wallet.
at
the
trial,
the
service
station
operator
identified
petitioner
as
the
person
who
was
holding
the
gun.
he
made
an
in-court
identification
of
petitioner
and
identified
these
items
as
his
personal
property,
the
cards
and
also
the
wallet.
testimony
further
disclosed
that
around
11:30
o'clock
p.m.
on
may
the
20th,
two
teenagers
saw
a
car,
a
light
blue
station
wagon
parked
in
a
parking
lot
near
the
teenage
girl's
home,
in
it
were
seated
four
negro
gentlemen.
they
then
testified
that
they
saw
this
station
wagon
circled
the
block
around
the
teenage
girl's
residence
and
also
a
gulf
service
station.
subsequently,
about
15
minutes
later,
someone
ran
from
the
service
station
exclaiming
that
there
had
been
a
robbery.
they
then
saw
within
a
few
seconds
this
light
blue
station
wagon
leave
the
parking
lot
at
a
high
rate
of
speed.
the
record
shows
that
service
station
was
not
visible
from
the
parking
area,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
at
anytime,
the
--
anyone
ran
from
the
service
station
to
the
automobile,
got
out
of
the
automobile
or
in
any
other
fashion
connected
at
with
the
robbery.
the
service
station
attendant
testified
that
two
negro
gentlemen
came
into
the
service
station
both
of
them
displayed
pistols
and
demanded
everything
that
they
had.
one
of
them,
one
is
wearing
a
green
sweater,
the
other
was
wearing
a
trench
coat.
he
took
the
change
that
he
had
and
put
it
in
his
right
hand
glove,
the
service
station
attendant's
glove,
and
gave
it
to
the
two
robbers.
as
police
were
summoned
they
came.
they
interviewed
the
teenagers
and
the
service
station
attendant
and
a
description
of
the
car
and
the
four
occupants
were
put
--
or
was
put
on
the
police
radio.
approximately,
45
minutes
to
an
hour
later,
two
neighboring
or
two
police
officers
in
the
neighboring
community
saw
a
vehicle
that
answer
the
description
that
have
been
put
on
the
radio
and
that
is
it
was
a
light
blue
compact
station
wagon
occupied
by
four
negroes.
at
that
time,
the
station
wagon
was
being
operated
back
toward
the
scene
of
the
crime
of
that
evening
or
the
previous
evening.
the
police
officers
pulled
the
vehicle
over
on
a
side
street,
now
the
commonwealth
has
argued
that
there
may
be
inferences
here
leading
or
could
be
inferred
that
the
gentlemen
were
attempting
to
elude
the
police
at
the
time
but
i
do
no
think
that
that's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record.
but
in
any
event
they
were
pulled
over
in
the
parking
lot.
they
got
out
of
the
station
wagon
and
the
police
officers
first
looked
at
that
point
for
weapons.
within
moments,
other
police
officers
from
the
community
where
the
robbery
had
taken
place
came
to
the
scene.
at
that
time,
those
police
officers
look
through
the
station
wagon
by
means
of
searchlight.
petitioner
and
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
were
then
taken
to
the
police
station
in
the
community
where
the
robbery
had
occurred.
they
were
again
searched,
at
that
time
moment
or
that
moment,
money
was
removed
from
their
purses.
the
police
officers
went
outside
and
made
a
search
of
a
vehicle.
the
chief
of
police
or
the
lieutenant
who
was
in-charge
testified
that
they
went
through
everything
to
indicate
the
depth
of
the
search.
they
went
back
inside
after
finding
nothing
again
questioned
petitioner
and
the
lawson,
one
of
the
other
co-defendants
went
back
out
again.
and
in
this
third
search
of
the
car,
one
of
the
officers
opened
up
a
bin
in
the
heater
and
from
this
bin
he
removed
two
pistols,
the
cards
taken
in
the
robbery
of
may
the
13th
and
a
personal
wallet
of
the
attendant
of
that
earlier
event.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
they
don't
say
its
explicitly,
your
honor,
what
they
do
assert
is
that
they
went
through
everything
and
found
nothing
and
it
appears
as
if
what
they
did
then
was
to
go
back
in
and
further
interrogate
or
attempt
to
interrogate
to
disclose
information.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
appendix
to
indicate
that.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
matter
of
continuity
is
a
little
hard
to
explain,
your
honor,
because
of
the
passage
of
time
that
must
be
on
inferred
from
the
testimony
of
the
officers
as
to
how
the
search
went
on.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
appears
as
if
this
was
the
only
thing
they
were
engaged
in,
mr.
chief
justice.
later
that
same
morning,
then
the
chief
of
police
of
the
community
obtained
a
search
warrant
and
went
to
the
homes
of
the
four
defendants
and
made
a
search.
in
the
homes
of
the
three
other
defendants
nothing
was
found.
he
went
to
petitioner's
residence
and
there
found
a
holster,
some
dumdum
bullets
that
were
matched
to
one
of
the
revolvers
found
in
the
search
of
the
car.
at
the
trial,
petitioner's
counsel
objected
to
the
introduction
of
these
dumdum
bullets
into
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
irrelevancy
at
first,
this
was
overruled.
then
the
police
officer
testified
on
the
stand
that
the
dumdum
bullets
matched
one
of
the
--
matched
the
bullets
taken
from
one
of
the
weapons
and
that
the
effect
of
the
dumdum
bullet
on
the
human
body
is
to
make
larger
holes
and
to
cause
more
tissue
damage.
petitioner's
counsel
again
objected.
this
time
he
objected
on
the
grounds
that
the
search
warrant
did
not
disclose
or
did
not
indicate
what
they
were
searching
for
and
it
did
not
specifically
say
what
they
were
searching
for.
unfortunately,
this
search
warrant
is
not
available
to
us
now.
it
has
been
lost,
it's
not
a
matter
of
this
record,
it
apparently
was
lost
before
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearings,
and
so
we
are
unable
to
say
at
the
present
time
exactly
what
the
search
warrant
did
disclose
except
for
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
when
he
was
on
stand
who
said
that
the
search
warrant
did
not
indicate
that
they
were
looking
for
bullets.
in
any
event,
petitioner's
then
counsel
objection
to
this
evidence
was
overruled
by
the
court
who
said
that
his
failure
to
file
pretrial
motions
meant
that
the
suppression
evidence
should
have
been
heard
earlier
not
having
been
heard
it
was
overruled
on
those
procedure
grounds.
the
jury
returned
verdicts
convicting
the
four
defendants
of
the
crimes
of
may
20th
and
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
6
to
15
years
imprisonment.
about
two
years
after
his
conviction,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court
and
evidentiary
hearing
was
held,
and
i've
summarized
for
you
what
was
disclosed
at
that
time
that
he
met
his
counsel
on
the
way
to
the
courtroom
for
the
trial.
there
is
no
extensive
discussion
as
to
what
preparation
if
any
there
was,
there
was
no
exploration
as
to
what
defenses
were
available
merely
those
statements.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
i
think
the
basic
proposition
which
start
with
the
things
disclosed
by
the
record
and
they
would
be
that
in
the
first
instance
the
trial
court
in
overruling
the
objections
to
the
dumdum
bullets
on
the
grounds
that
there
had
not
been
a
pretrial
motion
filed.
the
failure
of
counsel
to
recognize
the
very
valid
argument
in
connection
with
the
search
of
the
automobile
which
we
submit
to
this
court
at
this
time,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
pretrial
consultation
between
the
lawyer
and
his
colleagues
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
petitioner.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
doesn't
disclose
anything
except
in
this
record
that
i
now
have
before
the
court.
it
shows
there
that
there
were
other
objections
made
that
were
not
made
at
the
second
trial
for
other
reasons
that
apparently
were
not
known
to
the
lawyer
at
the
second
trial.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
believe
they
are
material.
in
connection
with
argument
we
submit
that
the
late
appointment
of
counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
case
were
so
prejudicial
to
whom
as
to
warrant
reversal.
this
court
in
getting
gideon
against
wainwright
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
when
charged
with
a
serious
crime
is
a
fundamental
right
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principles
of
powell
against
alabama
where
the
court
said
that
this
right
was
not
a
hollow
one
but
it
meant
appointment
at
such
time
and
under
such
circumstances
as
to
give
effective
aid
of
counsel
in
the
preparation
and
trial
the
case.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
initially
we
argue
in
the
alternative
but
i
believe
that
it's
not
necessary
under
powell
against
alabama
and
gideon
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
to
show
specific
prejudice
that
it's
not
necessary
where
you
have
the
issue
of
the
right
to
counsel
to
show
specific
prejudice.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that's
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
what
we're
really
concerned
with
here
though
your
honor
is
not
so
much
second
guessing
the
techniques
of
trial
but
we
are
talking
about
those
factors
that
are
extrinsic
to
the
trial
itself.
in
other
words,
appointment
at
such
a
time
that
he
could
prepare
that
he
could
do
those
things
it
will
lead
to
affective
assistance
to
counsel.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
we
can
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it's
not
necessarily
the
same
lawyers.
as
a
matter
of
practice
it's
not
necessarily
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
generally
speaking,
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
legal
aid
society,
your
honor,
may
have
been
appointed
as
such
but
he
never
met
the
lawyer
that
was
to
represent
him,
his
personal
counsel,
until
the
morning
of
trial.
this
is
what
the
record
discloses.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
think
he
did,
your
honor.
yes,
i
believe
he
did.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
we
submit
that
under
powell
against
the
alabama
that
the
components
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
should
have
been
provided
and
those
would
be
the
opportunity,
prepare
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
defenses,
to
interview
witnesses,
to
file
pretrial
motions.
none
of
these
things
could
have
been
done
by
petitioner
here.
we
can
say
that
the
legal
aid
society
may
have
been
appointed
but
what
we
have
to
speak
in
terms
of
is
the
effect
of
this
that
the
personal
counsel
that
was
furnished
to
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
were
none
filed.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
time
to
do
it.
in
other
cases
this
court
has
not
considered
the
possibility
of
prejudice
in
connection
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
glasser
against
united
states,
for
example,
where
the
court
determined
that
it
would
not
inquire
into
the
degree
of
prejudice
sustained
by
one
who
had
not
had
the
assistance
of
counsel
unimpaired
by
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
would
like
to
continue,
if
you
please.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
a
question
in
connection
with
when
petitioner
first
met
his
counsel,
i
find
it
in
the
appendix
of
page
256
the
testimony
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearing
indicates
that
he
first
met
his
counsel
on
the
morning
of
trial.
it
states
it
quite
clearly.
in
my
remaining
time
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
our
argument
in
connection
with
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
as
adopted
in
this
case
is
erroneous
that
for
the
reason
that
i
--
we
do
not
believe
that
you
must
show
specific
prejudice
in
order
to
warrant
reversal.
we
point
to
the
case
as
this
court
has
considered
in
connection
with
recidivist
proceedings
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
procedures.
but
in
any
event
if
you
assume
the
validity
of
the
rule
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
which
shifts
the
burden
to
the
prosecuting
authorities
to
show
that
there
was
not
any
prejudice
from
the
lay
appointment
of
counsel
that
this
rule
doesn't
fall
to
the
teachings
of
this
court
as
indicated
in
the
case
of
chapman.
because
in
chapman,
this
court
said
that
before
you
can
declare
a
constitutional
error
to
be
harmless
the
court
must
expressly
believe
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
this
rule
as
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
talks
in
terms
of
overcoming
this
prima
facie
case
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
solely
by
adequate
affirmative
proof
and
we
submit
that
adequate
affirmative
proof
in
this
case
is
not
the
same
thing
as
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
as
in
this
case,
we
have
nothing
but
the
trial
record
before
us.
and
all
that
trial
record
discloses
is
what
was
done
or
what
may
have
been
counsel
may
have
been
able
to
do
within
the
confines
of
the
record
as
stated.
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
what
could
have
been
done
and
was
not
done,
what
counsel
may
have
to
consider
and
yet
did
not
take
any
action
upon.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
there
are
instances
where
even
if
you
assume
the
validity
of
the
rule
and
ignore
the
dictates
of
chapman,
that
there
is
specific
prejudice
indicated,
indicated
by
the
failure
of
counsel
for
example
to
forcefully
argue
for
severance
of
the
indictments
of
the
two
counts
in
connection
with
the
two
separate
robberies.
there
is
no
common
scheme.
the
only
thing
in
common
about
them
was
the
fact
that
the
fruits
of
the
robberies
were
found
at
the
same
time.
there
are
other
things
to
consider.
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
went
beyond
the
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
inquired
into
the
adequacy
of
counsel
solely
by
reference
to
the
record
of
the
trial.
nothing
was
done
here
to
develop
what
counsel
could
have
done
through
his
own
testimony,
this
case
unlike
any
other
case
that
we
could
find
counsel
did
not
testify.
counsel
was
not
called
to
testify
either
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
hearings
or
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
legal
aid
society
records
were
never
introduced.
petitioner
was
never
examined
in
detail
as
to
what
defenses
he
may
have
had.
the
testimony
the
petitioner
at
the
place
i've
indicated
in
the
record
covers
just
a
few
pages
and
centers
around
the
fact
that
he
met
his
counsel
on
that
morning.
there
is
no
explanation
for
the
failure
of
the
counsel
for
example
to
file
the
pretrial
motions
as
indicated
by
the
record,
this
thing
should
be
determined
and
can
only
be
done
so
by
following
the
dictates
of
townsend
against
sain
and
having
a
preliminary
hearing.
turning
to
the
search
and
seizure
problem
we've
argued
in
the
brief
if
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
i
believe
that
that
argument
is
set
forth
adequately
in
the
brief.
i
would
like
however
in
the
remaining
time
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
this
third
circuit
did
in
this
case
and
connection
with
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
preston
against
united
states.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
preston,
this
court
decided
that
where
a
person
is
lawfully
arrested,
a
warrantless
search
can
be
made
for
two
purposes.
to
find
weapons
to
prevent
the
person
from
escaping
or
from
injuring
the
apprehending
officer
and
also
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
any
evidence.
the
third
circuit
in
its
cases
united
states
against
dento
placed
two
additional
distinguishing
features
into
that
test.
and
said
that
you
can
nevertheless
validate
a
warrantless
search
where
the
search
was
substantially
contemporaneous
and
there
was
a
reasonable
nexus
between
the
offense
and
the
search.
neither
of
these
matters
were
part
of
the
preston
test
and
should
not
become
a
part
of
our
law.
we
have
indicated
to
the
court
in
our
brief
the
case
of
wood
against
crouse
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
ably
distinguishes
preston
or
ably
distinguishes
dento
and
indicates
its
failure
to
follow
the
dictates
of
preston.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
was
driven
by
the
owner,
lawson,
one
of
the
co-defendants.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
the
policeman
was
in
the
car
with
him.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
believe
they
have
the
right
to
take
the
car
some
place
else,
your
honor,
to
the
station
perhaps.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
question
whether
they
have
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
we
assume
that
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
that
was
my
reason
for
saying,
to
get
it
off
the
street.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes,
that
would
be
all
that
they
could
do.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
nor
could
they
do
this,
do
the
things
that
they
did
in
this
case
which
was
to
conduct
after
they
have
taken
it
to
the
station
or
have
been
driven
to
the
station.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
can
just
take
it
to
the
station
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
get
it
off
the
street.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
can
move
it.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
why
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so
without
some
further
action.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
if
they
have
a
reason
to
believe,
your
honor,
but
they
could
have
got
themselves
a
warrant
in
the
time
or
left
someone
there
in
custody
of
the
car
or
have
a
police
officer
remain
with
the
car.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
yes.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
believe
so
on
to
the
dictates
of
preston.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
they
are
the
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
preston
permits
the
search
then
and
there
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
destruction
of
evidence
or
to
prevent
the
suspects
from
getting
to
weapons.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i
don't
think
it
would
permit
when
--
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
cooper.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
of
presenting
the
case
to
the
court.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
your
honor,
we
also
considered
it.
i
frankly
at
this
point
don't
recall
what
our
reasons
where
when
we
prepared
the
brief
for
not
including
it.
if
i
may,
there
was
one
thing
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
in
connection
with
the
waiver
of
the
argument
on
the
infectiveness
of
counsel,
i
think
the
case
of
fay
against
noia
decided
by
this
court
would
have
to
indicate
that
there
have
been
a
knowing
waiver
and
here
counsel
made
this
gratuitous
statement
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
and
it
was
not
participated
in
by
the
defendant
in
any
fashion.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
i'm
out
of
time.
mr.
vincent
j.
grogan
thank
you
very
much.
