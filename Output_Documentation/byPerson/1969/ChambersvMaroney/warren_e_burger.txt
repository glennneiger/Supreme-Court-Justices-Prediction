we'll
hear
argument
in
number
830,
chambers
against
maroney.
mr.
grogan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
another
factor
don't
we?
ordinary
human
experience
in
the
practice
and
the
habits
of
lawyers
that
two
lawyers
associated
in
the
same
organization
whether
be
a
law
firm
or
legal
aid
society
would
reasonably
be
in
communication
with
each
other
about
a
case
when
one
is
transferring
it
to
another
and
they
build
up
the
file
along
and
there's
some
things,
some
assumptions
that
can
demand
about
that
on
the
basis
of
experience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
suggest
that
this
was
the
only
matter
that
the
officers
where
then
engaged
in
or
did
they
have
other
things
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
point
anything
in
the
record
that
would
show
that
there
was
any
affect
of
assistance
where
there
was
any
dereliction
of
duty
or
failure
to
do
some
things
that
shouldn't
have
been
done
by
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
it
show
about
the
conduct
of
the
first
lawyer
in
the
relations
with
the
client,
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
the
objections
which
were
successfully
made
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
they
are
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
suspend
for
lunch
and
then
continue
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
want
to
keep
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
or
do
you
want
to
continue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
lis
--
do
you
agree
that
they
can
take
it
to
the
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
impound
it
so
that
no
one
could
remove
heroin
from
it
from
the
gas
tank
or
some
such
thing
or
pistols
from
the
heater.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
search
the
car?
let
me
get,
be
sure
to
get
that
clear.
put
them
on
the
setting
where
they
stopped
the
car
and
pull
it
onto
the
side
of
the
street.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
may
search
the
car,
top
to
bottom,
right
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
depends
the
search
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
the
harrison
or
harris
case
came
after
that,
set
a
little
bit
more
lay
down
to
subjects.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
under
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
cooper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,cooper
harris
or
harrison,
well,
no
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
los.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
the
impression
from
the
record
that
they
put
the
pistols
in,
they
put
the
weapons
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
not
the
bullet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
does
the
state
procedure
allow
a
right
of
allocution?
and
if
so,
was
it
exercise?
did
the
defendant
make
any
statement
of
his
own
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
it
will
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
in
exercising
that
right,
he
complained
about
the
performance
of
his
counsel
that
someone
would
have
bought
it
to
our
attention
and
to
yours
by
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
sure
about
the
presumption.
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
some
kind
of
presumption
that
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
see
the
client
until
the
day
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
--
on
that
basis,
half
of
the
barristers
of
england
and
half
of
the
cases
in
england
would
be
presumed
to
be
ineffective
because
they
rarely
ever
see
their
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
would
say
at
least.
but
an
associate
namely
under
the
british
system,
the
solicitor
and
in
allegheny
county,
the
investigator
for
the
public
defender's
office
seized
the
man
and
does
the
investigating,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it's
an
institutional
defense
that
he
has,
it
says
though
he
hired
a
law
firm
and
had
the
services
of
several
people
instead
of
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
so,
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
was
the
defendant
precluded
at
that
time
from
putting
in
any
evidence
he
wanted
to
on
the
subject
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
given
the
merits,
i
don't
recall
the
record
at
the
moment
but
you
spoke
of
eye
witnesses,
how
many
eyewitnesses
identified
this
appellant-petitioner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up
ms.
los.
but
i
have
one
question
for
you.
neither
you
nor
your
friend
seemed
to
cite
the
harris
or
harrison
case
out
of
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
which
at
least
a
great
many
people
read
as
considerable
clarification
of
the
preston
doctrine
where
the
automobile
was
searched
by
the
police
without
a
warrant
substantially
after
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
several
miles
away.
are
you
familiar
with
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
wondered
if
there
where
any
reason
to
think
that
it
was
not
in
the
point
as
i
sat
on
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
my
recollection
is
that
it's
very
much
in
point
here.
perhaps
mr.
grogan
will
shed
some
light
on
it
if
he
wishes
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
substantial
amount
of
time
left
if
you
wish
for
a
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
i'm
looking
at
the
wrong
sheet
and
the
wrong
case
and
it
showed
nine
minutes
but
i
was
mistaken.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
thank
you
for
your
submission
and
for
yours.

is
