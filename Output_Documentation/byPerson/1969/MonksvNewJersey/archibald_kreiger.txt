mr.
archibald
kreiger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
prefatory
statement
made
today
by
counsel
was
all
that
there
was
to
this
case,
i
am
frank
to
say
here
and
now
that
the
state
would
confess
error.
but
he
very
adroitly
and
i'm
sure
very
skillfully
has
kept
the
most
important,
distinctive,
significant
fact
of
this
entire
case
for
the
last
factor
and
only
when
questioning
by
the
court
has
brought
it
forth.
the
most
significant
fact
in
this
case
and
which
makes
this
case
different
from
any
others
was
anticipated
by
justice
stewart
when
he
said
have
this
court
ever
decided
a
question
involving
a
juvenile
where
the
confession
was
made
in
the
presence
of
a
court
assigned
representative
and
counsel
evaded
it
and
said
so
far
as
he
knows,
no.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
since
i
have
written
this
brief,
i've
made
further
research
and
i
would
like
to
help
the
court
on
this
--
in
this
connection.
in
my
brief
at
page
7,
i
referred
to
the
new
york
statute
which
provides
for
the
notification
of
a
parent
or
other
representative
before
a
juvenile
who
has
been
arrested
may
be
interrogated
i
have
found
that
there
is
a
similar
statute
in
arizona.
it
is
ars,
title
8,
section
221
and
construed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
1966
in
420
pacific
2nd
281,
where
the
court
held
that
when
a
juvenile
is
arrested
it
is
the
duty
of
the
arresting
officer
to
notify
the
probation
office
at
once
and
a
probation
officer
is
assigned
to
him
and
stays
with
him
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
rule
does
not
prevent
the
police
from
questioning
a
juvenile,
it
only
prevents
them
from
subjecting
the
juvenile
to
formal
interrogation
without
permission
of
the
person
appointed
and
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
rehabilitative
process
of
the
juvenile
court
and
to
see
that
he
is
prevented
from
overzealous
pressure.
without
such
a
statute
in
new
jersey,
the
juvenile
court
judge
in
this
case,
in
1957,
made
such
an
order
and
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
very
briefly
the
chronological
factors
in
this
case
which
i
regret
to
say
counsel
did
not
give
the
court
and
they
are
these.
this
juvenile
was
arrested
on
february
16th
by
the
patterson
police.
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
i
might
say
a
prohibitive
practice
under
new
jersey
law
but
notwithstanding,
the
juvenile
confessed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
justice
stewart,
i
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
never
saw
him,
i
don't
know
him.
i
only
know
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
i'm
sorry
i
can
--
i
cannot
help
you
on
that
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
no,
there
is
none
sir.
when
arrested
on
february
16th,
he
immediately
admitted
several
purse
snatchings
and
admitted
the
method
by
which
he
had
concealed
these
purses
by
burying
them
in
the
yard
of
a
certain
house
where
he
used
to
frequent
for
other
purposes.
the
police
immediately
went
to
the
scene
and
dug
up
and
uncovered
these
purses.
he
was
immediately
sent
to
the
children's
shelter
where
juveniles
are
detained
and
when
these
facts
came
to
light,
the
prosecutors
office
at
the
same
county
noted
some
similarity
between
the
modus
operandi
and
these
cases
and
the
two
unsolved
crimes
in
1956,
the
wise
affair
in
february
and
the
giambra
murder
in
november.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
indeed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
she
was
notified
on
february
the
27th
or
the
28th
after
the
confession
have
been
obtained.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
she
was
not
notified
before
for
reasons
i
cannot
give
you,
but
i
have
set
out
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
the
only
explanation
sir
i
can
give
is
this,
that
there
was
an
estrangement
between
the
juvenile
and
his
parents.
the
record
does
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
juvenile
never
requested
it,
never
manifested
any
interest
in
his
parents,
in
fact
he
had
run
away
from
home,
he
was
sleeping
in
the
cellar
of
a
friend
of
his
and
in
abandoned
cars.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
legal
terms
justice
marshall,
but
i'm
saying
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
the
state
did
not
question
him
for
10
days.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
had
been
held
--
he
had
been
held
for
the
unrelated
purse
snatching,
that
was
his
original
detention.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that
is
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
why?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
can't,
no
i
can't,
but
the
record
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
record
indicates
--
the
record
indicates
that
this
juvenile
never
manifested
an
interest.
he
never
asked
the
superintendent
at
the
shelter
to
call
his
parents
or
advise
them
of
where
he
was.
he
--
he
was
estranged
from
his
parents.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
no.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
protection
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
--
that
the
judge
shamick
of
the
juvenile
court
have
afforded
this
juvenile
by
providing
for
interrogation
only
in
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes
sir,
he
did.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
was
told
--
he
was
told
by
the
probation
officer
that
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
i
will
get
it
and
i
will
--
i'll
supply
it
to
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
on
february
18th,
prosecutor's
office,
after
noting
similarity
between
the
purse
snatchings
for
which
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
16th
decided
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
and
being
in
the
shelter
they
applied
to
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
for
permission
to
interrogate
him.
the
judge
granted
permission
on
condition
that
such
interrogation
take
place
only
and
at
all
times
in
the
presence
of
a
probation
officer
mr.
chester
jermalowics.
on
february
the
18th
in
the
presence
of
chester
jermalowics
at
the
children
shelter,
this
juvenile
was
interrogated
and
he
made
a
slip
of
the
tongue
in
which
he
said,
they
mentioned
something
to
him
about,
did
you
ever
engage
in
any
purse
snatchings
on
31st
street,
32nd
street,
28th
street
and
they
enumerated
this
east
side
section
of
patterson.
and
when
it
came
to
31st
street,
which
is
where
the
wise
assault
took
place,
he
says,
“oh”,
he
says,
“i
have
an
alibi
for
that
one.”
no
one
asked
him
or
even
mentioned
anything
about
wise.
and
then
when
they
came
to
wall
avenue
which
was
in
back
of
saint
theresa's
church
where
bingo
games
were
held
quite
often
and
where
the
victim
giambra
was
going
the
evening
when
she
was
assaulted
and
later
died,
he
said,
“oh”,
he
says,
“that
girl,
i
read
about
that
in
the
paper,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.”
well,
with
that
as
a
starting
point,
the
prosecutor's
detectives
said
to
him,
willy,
would
you
submit
to
a
lie
detector
test?
and
this
juvenile,
age
15
said
why
certainly
he
says,
they
are
fake,
they
don't
prove
anything
even
when
they
--
you
submit
to
them.
very
well,
and
that's
all
the
interrogation
that
took
place
that
day.
on
the
21st,
three
days
later,
arrangements
were
made
for
the
polygraph
operator
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
and
the
interrogation
took
place
in
an
anteroom
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
courthouse
in
patterson.
the
tests
were
submitted,
not
lengthy,
and
immediately
after
he
was
taken
back
by
the
probation
officer
to
the
children's
shelter.
and
the
polygraph
operator
advised
the
detectives
who
were
handling
this
case,
don't
ask
him
or
pursue
any
further
interrogation
and
there
was
no
further
interrogation.
in
the
mean
time,
prosecutor's
office
pursued
their
own
independent
investigation
and
they
came
up
with
the
names
of
a
few
of
his
friends
and
associates.
two
of
them,
one
was
named
aug
and
the
other
one
was
named
stafford.
they
interrogated
them
and
they
found
out
from
them
that
this
monks
had
a
day
or
two
after
the
wise
assault
which
took
place
at
east
31st
street
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right,
that's
right
sir
--
boasted
to
one
of
his
friends
that
he
had
committed
that
assault
and
he
had
received
something
like
$30.00
that
she
had
in
her
purse.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
yes,
yes.
now,
what
made
the
wise
case
interesting
and
which
gave
the
police
the
indication
that
this
young
man
was
connected
with
this
assault
was
that
on
the
evening
of
the
assault,
it
had
been
snowing
and
immediately
after
this
girl
had
been
assaulted
and
was
unconscious,
the
police
came
to
the
scene
and
there
were
footprints
that
led
from
the
place
of
the
assault
to
a
house
two-and-a-half
blocks
away
on
15th
avenue
and
the
footprints
led
in
the
back
door
of
that
particular
house.
during
the
period
of
investigation
in
57,
when
this
young
man
was
not
being
interrogated,
the
police
found
out
that
young
monks
frequented
this
place
with
his
friends,
where
they
would
go
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
do
other
little
things
of
that
sort,
in
privacy
and
in
fact,
the
confession
indicates
that
this
was
the
place,
the
backyard
of
which
he
had
buried
the
purses
that
he
had
snatched.
well,
on
that
next
occasion
of
interrogation,
the
lie
detector
operator
was
present
and
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
he
isn't.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
he
is
mr.
arthur
who
is
associated
with
the
reid
associates
who
are
lie
detector
operators.
i
think
they
have
offices
in
chicago
and
new
york.
incidentally,
mr.
reid
is
coauthor
with
professor
inbau
on
a
lie
detection
and
interrogation,
one
of
the
books
cited
by
the
former
chief
justice
warren
in
miranda.
on
the
26th
of
february,
which
was
the
next
occasion,
mr.
jermalowics
went
to
the
children's
shelter
in
the
morning
of
that
day,
i
think
around
10
o'clock
or
so.
he
picked
up
mr.
monks
and
he
brought
him
to
the
courthouse
and
it
is
true
that
he
was
interrogated
a
little
bit,
not
too
much.
he
was
again
subjected
to
lie
detector
tests
not
quite
a
few
but
a
minute,
two
minutes,
five
minutes,
nothing
extensive,
nothing
to
wear
out
this
young
man
or
to
use
the
language
that
this
court
has
used
quite
often
in
these
--
only
in
these
two
juvenile
cases
that
i
know
of.
hailey
and
gallegos.
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
and
this
record
doesn't
show
the
slightest,
callous
disregard
of
the
right
of
this
juvenile
and
bear
in
mind
that
in
1957,
the
criminal
law
annunciated
by
this
court
was
not
what
it
is
today.
in
fact,
we
claim
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
hailey
was
48,
1948.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
but
i
see
and
i
have
stated,
there
is
the
only
similarity
between
hailey
and
this
case
is
that
they
were
both
15
years
of
age,
because
in
this
case
we
claim
and
the
record
shows
unless
you
disagree
with
methods
that
the
methods
of
the
police
in
the
interrogation
of
this
juvenile
were
fair,
reasonable,
penetrating,
and
with
an
attempt
to
find
out
whether
this
young
man
was
involved
in
this
heinous
offense
of
murder.
nothing
wrong
about
that,
a
fair
instrumentality
in
criminal
investigation.
we
state
that
the
purpose
of
this
probation
officer
were
several.
first
of
all,
to
allow
interrogation,
and
to
prevent
overzealous
pressure,
to
see
to
it
that
the
interrogation
was
fair
and
that
he
was
not
tired,
deprived
of
refreshment,
rest
or
relief.
the
right
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
granted
by
the
juvenile
court
did
not
require
that
the
probation
officer
act
as
his
counsel,
tell
him
what
questions
to
answer,
and
what
questions
what
not
to
answer.
the
fact
is,
that
during
a
particular
law
when
the
proceedings,
when
the
detectives
went
to
the
other
part
of
the
room
and
were
conferring
about
things
and
trying
to
piece
together
various
things
that
had
already
been
developed,
the
probation
officer
sat
alone
with
this
juvenile
and
he
said
to
him
willie,
he
says,
i
don't
want
you
to
say
anything
to
these
police
officers
unless
it's
the
truth
and
i
don't
want
you
to
worry
about
this
because
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide.
i
see
nothing
wrong
about
this
kind
of
advise
to
a
juvenile
from
a
probation
officer
because
bear
in
mind
that
even
up
until
the
first
decision
of
this
term
--
of
this
court
--
by
this
court
in
this
recent
case
involving
the
nebraska
statute
on
juveniles
as
to
whether
there
was
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
which
this
court
did
not
deem
necessary
to
decide,
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
said
that
the
juvenile
court
is
still
setup
for
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation
and
has
not
yet
become
a
court
for
the
trial
of
juvenile
criminals
and
in
1957,
the
viewpoint
whether
good,
bad
or
indifferent
was
clearly
consistent
with
that
policy.
now,
what
else
was
this
probation
officer
designed
to
do?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
an
application
was
made
by
the
prosecutor's
detectives
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
because
he
was
in
custody
at
the
juvenile
--
at
the
children's
shelter.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
permission.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
and
the
court
granted
permission
providing
that
the
probation
officer
was
present
at
all
times
during
interrogation.
now,
much
has
been
made
by
petitioner
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
what
the
officer
said.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
precisely.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
they
didn't
beat
his
brains
out
justice
marshall.
there
isn't
a
word
in
this
record
expressly
or
by
fair
inference.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
and
he
was
a
probation
officer
for
15
years,
assigned
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
but
how
about
his
experience
as
a
probation
officer
and
handling
the
juveniles
for
15
years
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
--
which
gave
him
great
competence
in
the
understanding
of
the
probation
process.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
didn't
advise
this
boy,
he
was
not
there
as
his
counsel.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
tell
him
to
tell
them
--
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
don't
call
that
counseling.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
don't
call
that
counsel.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
because
gentlemen,
if
this
young
man
had
a
lawyer,
this
juvenile
would
never
have
uttered
a
word
and
this
would
have
been
and
remained
an
unsolved
offense
because
i
don't
still
think
that
a
juvenile
should
receive
the
advise
or
the
same
kind
of
advise
that
a
mature
person
should
receive
when
it
comes
and
bearing
in
mind
his
future
development.
for
whatever
it's
worth,
in
a
case
cited
in
my
brief,
chief
justice
weintraub
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
this
carlo,
we
call
it
state
in
the
interest
of
carlo,
cited
in
my
brief,
where
he
stated
that
when
in
comes
to
juveniles
and
the
advise
should
he
receive
it
would
be
incongruous
for
his
parent
if
he
is
present
at
the
time
of
police
interrogation
to
advise
this
young
juvenile
not
to
talk,
to
remain
silent
because
among
things
in
the
development
of
character
and
personality
as
chief
justice
weintraub
said
is
the
lesson
which
a
juvenile
must
learn
early
to
face
the
music
and
he
didn't
think
and
he
stated
in
his
viewpoint
in
dealing
with
a
juvenile
that
the
same
kind
of
advise
should
be
handed
to
a
juvenile
as
would
be
given
to
a
mature
person,
bearing
in
mind
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
juvenile
and
rehabilitation
process
and
the
process
of
the
criminal
law
and
they
are
still
distinct.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
miranda,
he
gets
the
miranda
warning,
he
does
sir,
he
does.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
gets
the
warnings
required
by
miranda.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true,
that's
true.
i
don't
think
that
gault
has
so
overshadowed
the
entire
juvenile
process
that
it
has,
as
justice
douglas
said,
converted
the
juvenile
court
into
a
trial
for
juvenile
criminals.
i
don't
think
that
has
yet
happened,
whether
it
will
or
not,
the
future
will
determine
that
factor.
the
--
the
fact
is
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
he
gets
me,
he
gets
one.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
fact
is
in
our
judgment
that
most
of
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
been
what
i
would
choose
to
describe
an
inflation
of
the
significance
of
what
are
not
such
serious
matters
or
as
the
phrase
has
once
been,
there
has
been
an
abundant
resort
to
labels
in
this
case.
labeling
everything
that
has
happened
here
as
being
of
a
terrible
nature
and
trying
to
put
them
all
together
and
to
come
up
with
the
phrase,
a
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
of
this
particular
accused
in
order
to
justify
and
finally
come
up
with
the
description
that
there
was
an
involuntary
or
a
coerced
confession.
i
submit
gentlemen
that
what
has
been
happening
here
by
the
petitioner's
description
of
the
various
acts
that
are
in
this
record
and
that
are
lively
--
likely
as
well
to
be
innocent
and
free
from
the
terrible
connotations
placed
upon
them
was
the
imposition
of
what
one
of
the
former
justices
of
these
court
referred
to
as
the
tyranny
of
labels.
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer,
the
overall
conduct
of
the
police
in
their
interrogation
which
was
fair,
reasonable,
humane,
inhuman
and
civilized
did
not
add
up
to
such
a
destruction
of
the
will
or
such
an
overbearing
of
the
ability
of
this
juvenile
to
withstand
the
interrogation
as
to
constitute
an
enforced
coerced
or
wrung
out
confession.
we
think
that
on
the
total
record
and
on
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
taken
together
without
fragmentation
or
isolation
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
of
this
juvenile,
but
that
there
was
a
fair,
reasonable,
and
decent
regard
for
his
rights
and
that
this
confession
in
this
case
was
voluntary
and
should
be
sustained.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
he
is,
and
i
might
say
this
justice
harlan,
he
has
come
up
for
parole
three
or
four
times
and
he
has
been
turned
down
on
the
basis
of
poor
adjustment
and
i
can
also
say
this,
this
record
has
facts
in
here
that
are
a
little
cloudy
as
to
why
a
1957
adjudication
finally
came
before
the
appellant
division
in
new
jersey
in
1968
and
i
think
you're
entitled
to
know
why.
in
the
first
place
there
were
two
court
reporters
in
this
case.
immediately
after
the
adjudication
of
delinquency,
one
of
them
was
called
to
the
service
and
immediately
sent
overseas.
so
for
three
years
there
was
an
inability
to
get
the
part
of
the
transcript
prepared
which
this
reporter
had
taken.
and
we
have
in
new
jersey,
an
appeal
--
a
notice
of
appeal
have
been
filed
and
we
have
in
new
jersey
a
practice
where
periodically
the
clerk
issues
a
show
cause
for
a
dismissal
of
cases
which
have
not
been
prosecuted
as
the
rules
require
and
i
know
i
was
in
the
office
on
each
of
these
occasions.
this
young
man
would
be
consulted
and
would
consult
his
counsel,
would
go
and
see
him
at
the
board
and
town
reformatory
where
he
had
been
committed
originally.
and
he
would
say
to
his
counsel
i
don't
want
to
go
through
with
this
appeal
yet
but
see
if
you
can
hold
it
off
because
i'm
coming
up
for
parole
and
i
don't
want
this
to
interfere
with
my
parole.
well,
the
court
wouldn't
dismiss
the
appeal,
would
accept
this.
before
you
know
it
time
runs
by.
in
1967,
he
was
transferred
from
the
board
and
town
reformatory
to
state's
prison
which
i
call
the
post
graduate
elevation
where
he
undoubtedly
met
jail
house
lawyers
and
who
aided
and
assisted
him
in
filing
pro
se
in
the
appellant
division
in
august
1968,
an
application
to
revive
the
appeal
which
had
been
suspended
and
to
proceed
and
it
was
granted.
counsel
is
assigned,
case
was
argued,
appellant
division
decided
it
and
so
it
went
and
here
we
are.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
happened
justice
white
is
that
on
march
20th
he
was
committed
by
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
for
the
purse
snatching
for
which
he
was
arrested
on
february
the
16th,
the
board
and
town
reformatory,
for
an
indefinite
term.
and
it
was
while
he
was
in
board
and
town
and
after
he
had
--
their
complaint
had
been
filed
against
him
for
wise
and
giambra,
in
december
he
was
brought
from
board
and
town
reformatory
to
the
courthouse
that
sheltered
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
under
new
jersey
law,
he
would
be
detained
for
such
period
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
of
managers
at
board
and
town
reformatory
thought
him
to
be
ready
to
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
is
detained
at
the
children's
shelter
or
he
may
be
released
in
the
custody
of
his
parents
or
he
may
be
released
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
why
he
was
detained
after
february
16th
is
because
on
march
the
8th
this
--
or
march
the
2nd
or
3rd,
the
complaints
were
filed
in
wise
and
giambra
and
counsel
was
assigned
to
him.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
just
as
a
matter
of
--
for
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
by
that
i
don't
know
sir.
it
all
depends
upon
--
it
all
depends
upon
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
and
the
state
of
their
calendar
and
the
circumstances
and
he
might
have
been
detained
because
of
his
prior
involvement
in
other
juvenile
offenses
where
he
had
been
involved
and
likewise,
it
might
had
been
made
against
him
by
his
parents
for
having
runaway
from
home
so
that
this
young
man
was
not
the
ideal
youngster
for
release
to
the
streets.
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
life
in
new
jersey
means
you
are
eligible
for
parole
after
13
and
a
half
years
and
he
has
practically
served
that.
although
in
this
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
in
this
instance
as
a
juvenile
--
as
a
juvenile,
he
was
eligible
for
parole
before
13
and
a
half
years.
in
fact
as
i
say,
he
has
been
up
for
a
parole
set
up
as
much
as
i
know
four
times.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
my
best
judgment,
that's
my
best
judgment.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
indeed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
under
the
1958
act
which
was
held
retroactive
even
though
he
was
adjudicated
in
1957
because
it
was
beneficial
to
the
juvenile
and
not
harmful,
because
for
the
first
time
it
did
away
for
indeterminate
sentences
in
the
case
of
juveniles
and
provided
for
fixed
terms
not
to
exceed
age
21
except
in
homicide.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
if
the
court
cares
for
argument
on
the
second
point
dealing
with
the
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
life
sentence,
otherwise,
i
would
rely
upon
my
brief
in
the
argument
contained
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
justice
black
i'm
sure
--
you
will
find
that
in
the
trial
transcript
that's
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
because
this
appendix
was
an
abridged
matter.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
was
abridged
by
agreement
between
me
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
but
the
facts
concerning
his
prior
involvement
are
in
the
transcript
of
the
entire
trial
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
your
clerk.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
prefatory
statement
made
today
by
counsel
was
all
that
there
was
to
this
case,
i
am
frank
to
say
here
and
now
that
the
state
would
confess
error.
but
he
very
adroitly
and
i'm
sure
very
skillfully
has
kept
the
most
important,
distinctive,
significant
fact
of
this
entire
case
for
the
last
factor
and
only
when
questioning
by
the
court
has
brought
it
forth.
the
most
significant
fact
in
this
case
and
which
makes
this
case
different
from
any
others
was
anticipated
by
justice
stewart
when
he
said
have
this
court
ever
decided
a
question
involving
a
juvenile
where
the
confession
was
made
in
the
presence
of
a
court
assigned
representative
and
counsel
evaded
it
and
said
so
far
as
he
knows,
no.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
since
i
have
written
this
brief,
i've
made
further
research
and
i
would
like
to
help
the
court
on
this
--
in
this
connection.
in
my
brief
at
page
7,
i
referred
to
the
new
york
statute
which
provides
for
the
notification
of
a
parent
or
other
representative
before
a
juvenile
who
has
been
arrested
may
be
interrogated
i
have
found
that
there
is
a
similar
statute
in
arizona.
it
is
ars,
title
8,
section
221
and
construed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
1966
in
420
pacific
2nd
281,
where
the
court
held
that
when
a
juvenile
is
arrested
it
is
the
duty
of
the
arresting
officer
to
notify
the
probation
office
at
once
and
a
probation
officer
is
assigned
to
him
and
stays
with
him
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
rule
does
not
prevent
the
police
from
questioning
a
juvenile,
it
only
prevents
them
from
subjecting
the
juvenile
to
formal
interrogation
without
permission
of
the
person
appointed
and
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
rehabilitative
process
of
the
juvenile
court
and
to
see
that
he
is
prevented
from
overzealous
pressure.
without
such
a
statute
in
new
jersey,
the
juvenile
court
judge
in
this
case,
in
1957,
made
such
an
order
and
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
very
briefly
the
chronological
factors
in
this
case
which
i
regret
to
say
counsel
did
not
give
the
court
and
they
are
these.
this
juvenile
was
arrested
on
february
16th
by
the
patterson
police.
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
i
might
say
a
prohibitive
practice
under
new
jersey
law
but
notwithstanding,
the
juvenile
confessed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
justice
stewart,
i
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
never
saw
him,
i
don't
know
him.
i
only
know
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
i'm
sorry
i
can
--
i
cannot
help
you
on
that
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
no,
there
is
none
sir.
when
arrested
on
february
16th,
he
immediately
admitted
several
purse
snatchings
and
admitted
the
method
by
which
he
had
concealed
these
purses
by
burying
them
in
the
yard
of
a
certain
house
where
he
used
to
frequent
for
other
purposes.
the
police
immediately
went
to
the
scene
and
dug
up
and
uncovered
these
purses.
he
was
immediately
sent
to
the
children's
shelter
where
juveniles
are
detained
and
when
these
facts
came
to
light,
the
prosecutors
office
at
the
same
county
noted
some
similarity
between
the
modus
operandi
and
these
cases
and
the
two
unsolved
crimes
in
1956,
the
wise
affair
in
february
and
the
giambra
murder
in
november.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
indeed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
she
was
notified
on
february
the
27th
or
the
28th
after
the
confession
have
been
obtained.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
she
was
not
notified
before
for
reasons
i
cannot
give
you,
but
i
have
set
out
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
the
only
explanation
sir
i
can
give
is
this,
that
there
was
an
estrangement
between
the
juvenile
and
his
parents.
the
record
does
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
juvenile
never
requested
it,
never
manifested
any
interest
in
his
parents,
in
fact
he
had
run
away
from
home,
he
was
sleeping
in
the
cellar
of
a
friend
of
his
and
in
abandoned
cars.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
legal
terms
justice
marshall,
but
i'm
saying
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
the
state
did
not
question
him
for
10
days.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
had
been
held
--
he
had
been
held
for
the
unrelated
purse
snatching,
that
was
his
original
detention.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that
is
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
why?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
can't,
no
i
can't,
but
the
record
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
record
indicates
--
the
record
indicates
that
this
juvenile
never
manifested
an
interest.
he
never
asked
the
superintendent
at
the
shelter
to
call
his
parents
or
advise
them
of
where
he
was.
he
--
he
was
estranged
from
his
parents.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
no.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
protection
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
--
that
the
judge
shamick
of
the
juvenile
court
have
afforded
this
juvenile
by
providing
for
interrogation
only
in
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes
sir,
he
did.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
was
told
--
he
was
told
by
the
probation
officer
that
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
i
will
get
it
and
i
will
--
i'll
supply
it
to
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
on
february
18th,
prosecutor's
office,
after
noting
similarity
between
the
purse
snatchings
for
which
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
16th
decided
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
and
being
in
the
shelter
they
applied
to
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
for
permission
to
interrogate
him.
the
judge
granted
permission
on
condition
that
such
interrogation
take
place
only
and
at
all
times
in
the
presence
of
a
probation
officer
mr.
chester
jermalowics.
on
february
the
18th
in
the
presence
of
chester
jermalowics
at
the
children
shelter,
this
juvenile
was
interrogated
and
he
made
a
slip
of
the
tongue
in
which
he
said,
they
mentioned
something
to
him
about,
did
you
ever
engage
in
any
purse
snatchings
on
31st
street,
32nd
street,
28th
street
and
they
enumerated
this
east
side
section
of
patterson.
and
when
it
came
to
31st
street,
which
is
where
the
wise
assault
took
place,
he
says,
“oh”,
he
says,
“i
have
an
alibi
for
that
one.”
no
one
asked
him
or
even
mentioned
anything
about
wise.
and
then
when
they
came
to
wall
avenue
which
was
in
back
of
saint
theresa's
church
where
bingo
games
were
held
quite
often
and
where
the
victim
giambra
was
going
the
evening
when
she
was
assaulted
and
later
died,
he
said,
“oh”,
he
says,
“that
girl,
i
read
about
that
in
the
paper,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.”
well,
with
that
as
a
starting
point,
the
prosecutor's
detectives
said
to
him,
willy,
would
you
submit
to
a
lie
detector
test?
and
this
juvenile,
age
15
said
why
certainly
he
says,
they
are
fake,
they
don't
prove
anything
even
when
they
--
you
submit
to
them.
very
well,
and
that's
all
the
interrogation
that
took
place
that
day.
on
the
21st,
three
days
later,
arrangements
were
made
for
the
polygraph
operator
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
and
the
interrogation
took
place
in
an
anteroom
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
courthouse
in
patterson.
the
tests
were
submitted,
not
lengthy,
and
immediately
after
he
was
taken
back
by
the
probation
officer
to
the
children's
shelter.
and
the
polygraph
operator
advised
the
detectives
who
were
handling
this
case,
don't
ask
him
or
pursue
any
further
interrogation
and
there
was
no
further
interrogation.
in
the
mean
time,
prosecutor's
office
pursued
their
own
independent
investigation
and
they
came
up
with
the
names
of
a
few
of
his
friends
and
associates.
two
of
them,
one
was
named
aug
and
the
other
one
was
named
stafford.
they
interrogated
them
and
they
found
out
from
them
that
this
monks
had
a
day
or
two
after
the
wise
assault
which
took
place
at
east
31st
street
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right,
that's
right
sir
--
boasted
to
one
of
his
friends
that
he
had
committed
that
assault
and
he
had
received
something
like
$30.00
that
she
had
in
her
purse.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
yes,
yes.
now,
what
made
the
wise
case
interesting
and
which
gave
the
police
the
indication
that
this
young
man
was
connected
with
this
assault
was
that
on
the
evening
of
the
assault,
it
had
been
snowing
and
immediately
after
this
girl
had
been
assaulted
and
was
unconscious,
the
police
came
to
the
scene
and
there
were
footprints
that
led
from
the
place
of
the
assault
to
a
house
two-and-a-half
blocks
away
on
15th
avenue
and
the
footprints
led
in
the
back
door
of
that
particular
house.
during
the
period
of
investigation
in
57,
when
this
young
man
was
not
being
interrogated,
the
police
found
out
that
young
monks
frequented
this
place
with
his
friends,
where
they
would
go
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
do
other
little
things
of
that
sort,
in
privacy
and
in
fact,
the
confession
indicates
that
this
was
the
place,
the
backyard
of
which
he
had
buried
the
purses
that
he
had
snatched.
well,
on
that
next
occasion
of
interrogation,
the
lie
detector
operator
was
present
and
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
he
isn't.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
no,
he
is
mr.
arthur
who
is
associated
with
the
reid
associates
who
are
lie
detector
operators.
i
think
they
have
offices
in
chicago
and
new
york.
incidentally,
mr.
reid
is
coauthor
with
professor
inbau
on
a
lie
detection
and
interrogation,
one
of
the
books
cited
by
the
former
chief
justice
warren
in
miranda.
on
the
26th
of
february,
which
was
the
next
occasion,
mr.
jermalowics
went
to
the
children's
shelter
in
the
morning
of
that
day,
i
think
around
10
o'clock
or
so.
he
picked
up
mr.
monks
and
he
brought
him
to
the
courthouse
and
it
is
true
that
he
was
interrogated
a
little
bit,
not
too
much.
he
was
again
subjected
to
lie
detector
tests
not
quite
a
few
but
a
minute,
two
minutes,
five
minutes,
nothing
extensive,
nothing
to
wear
out
this
young
man
or
to
use
the
language
that
this
court
has
used
quite
often
in
these
--
only
in
these
two
juvenile
cases
that
i
know
of.
hailey
and
gallegos.
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
and
this
record
doesn't
show
the
slightest,
callous
disregard
of
the
right
of
this
juvenile
and
bear
in
mind
that
in
1957,
the
criminal
law
annunciated
by
this
court
was
not
what
it
is
today.
in
fact,
we
claim
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
pardon?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
hailey
was
48,
1948.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
but
i
see
and
i
have
stated,
there
is
the
only
similarity
between
hailey
and
this
case
is
that
they
were
both
15
years
of
age,
because
in
this
case
we
claim
and
the
record
shows
unless
you
disagree
with
methods
that
the
methods
of
the
police
in
the
interrogation
of
this
juvenile
were
fair,
reasonable,
penetrating,
and
with
an
attempt
to
find
out
whether
this
young
man
was
involved
in
this
heinous
offense
of
murder.
nothing
wrong
about
that,
a
fair
instrumentality
in
criminal
investigation.
we
state
that
the
purpose
of
this
probation
officer
were
several.
first
of
all,
to
allow
interrogation,
and
to
prevent
overzealous
pressure,
to
see
to
it
that
the
interrogation
was
fair
and
that
he
was
not
tired,
deprived
of
refreshment,
rest
or
relief.
the
right
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
granted
by
the
juvenile
court
did
not
require
that
the
probation
officer
act
as
his
counsel,
tell
him
what
questions
to
answer,
and
what
questions
what
not
to
answer.
the
fact
is,
that
during
a
particular
law
when
the
proceedings,
when
the
detectives
went
to
the
other
part
of
the
room
and
were
conferring
about
things
and
trying
to
piece
together
various
things
that
had
already
been
developed,
the
probation
officer
sat
alone
with
this
juvenile
and
he
said
to
him
willie,
he
says,
i
don't
want
you
to
say
anything
to
these
police
officers
unless
it's
the
truth
and
i
don't
want
you
to
worry
about
this
because
let
your
conscience
be
your
guide.
i
see
nothing
wrong
about
this
kind
of
advise
to
a
juvenile
from
a
probation
officer
because
bear
in
mind
that
even
up
until
the
first
decision
of
this
term
--
of
this
court
--
by
this
court
in
this
recent
case
involving
the
nebraska
statute
on
juveniles
as
to
whether
there
was
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
which
this
court
did
not
deem
necessary
to
decide,
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
said
that
the
juvenile
court
is
still
setup
for
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation
and
has
not
yet
become
a
court
for
the
trial
of
juvenile
criminals
and
in
1957,
the
viewpoint
whether
good,
bad
or
indifferent
was
clearly
consistent
with
that
policy.
now,
what
else
was
this
probation
officer
designed
to
do?
mr.
archibald
kreiger
an
application
was
made
by
the
prosecutor's
detectives
to
interrogate
this
juvenile
because
he
was
in
custody
at
the
juvenile
--
at
the
children's
shelter.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
permission.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
and
the
court
granted
permission
providing
that
the
probation
officer
was
present
at
all
times
during
interrogation.
now,
much
has
been
made
by
petitioner
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
what
the
officer
said.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
precisely.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
they
didn't
beat
his
brains
out
justice
marshall.
there
isn't
a
word
in
this
record
expressly
or
by
fair
inference.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
and
he
was
a
probation
officer
for
15
years,
assigned
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
but
how
about
his
experience
as
a
probation
officer
and
handling
the
juveniles
for
15
years
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
--
which
gave
him
great
competence
in
the
understanding
of
the
probation
process.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
didn't
advise
this
boy,
he
was
not
there
as
his
counsel.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
tell
him
to
tell
them
--
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
don't
call
that
counseling.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
don't
call
that
counsel.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
because
gentlemen,
if
this
young
man
had
a
lawyer,
this
juvenile
would
never
have
uttered
a
word
and
this
would
have
been
and
remained
an
unsolved
offense
because
i
don't
still
think
that
a
juvenile
should
receive
the
advise
or
the
same
kind
of
advise
that
a
mature
person
should
receive
when
it
comes
and
bearing
in
mind
his
future
development.
for
whatever
it's
worth,
in
a
case
cited
in
my
brief,
chief
justice
weintraub
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
in
this
carlo,
we
call
it
state
in
the
interest
of
carlo,
cited
in
my
brief,
where
he
stated
that
when
in
comes
to
juveniles
and
the
advise
should
he
receive
it
would
be
incongruous
for
his
parent
if
he
is
present
at
the
time
of
police
interrogation
to
advise
this
young
juvenile
not
to
talk,
to
remain
silent
because
among
things
in
the
development
of
character
and
personality
as
chief
justice
weintraub
said
is
the
lesson
which
a
juvenile
must
learn
early
to
face
the
music
and
he
didn't
think
and
he
stated
in
his
viewpoint
in
dealing
with
a
juvenile
that
the
same
kind
of
advise
should
be
handed
to
a
juvenile
as
would
be
given
to
a
mature
person,
bearing
in
mind
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
juvenile
and
rehabilitation
process
and
the
process
of
the
criminal
law
and
they
are
still
distinct.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
miranda,
he
gets
the
miranda
warning,
he
does
sir,
he
does.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
gets
the
warnings
required
by
miranda.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true
sir.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
true,
that's
true.
i
don't
think
that
gault
has
so
overshadowed
the
entire
juvenile
process
that
it
has,
as
justice
douglas
said,
converted
the
juvenile
court
into
a
trial
for
juvenile
criminals.
i
don't
think
that
has
yet
happened,
whether
it
will
or
not,
the
future
will
determine
that
factor.
the
--
the
fact
is
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
right.
he
gets
me,
he
gets
one.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
the
fact
is
in
our
judgment
that
most
of
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
been
what
i
would
choose
to
describe
an
inflation
of
the
significance
of
what
are
not
such
serious
matters
or
as
the
phrase
has
once
been,
there
has
been
an
abundant
resort
to
labels
in
this
case.
labeling
everything
that
has
happened
here
as
being
of
a
terrible
nature
and
trying
to
put
them
all
together
and
to
come
up
with
the
phrase,
a
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
of
this
particular
accused
in
order
to
justify
and
finally
come
up
with
the
description
that
there
was
an
involuntary
or
a
coerced
confession.
i
submit
gentlemen
that
what
has
been
happening
here
by
the
petitioner's
description
of
the
various
acts
that
are
in
this
record
and
that
are
lively
--
likely
as
well
to
be
innocent
and
free
from
the
terrible
connotations
placed
upon
them
was
the
imposition
of
what
one
of
the
former
justices
of
these
court
referred
to
as
the
tyranny
of
labels.
we
think
that
in
this
case,
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer,
the
overall
conduct
of
the
police
in
their
interrogation
which
was
fair,
reasonable,
humane,
inhuman
and
civilized
did
not
add
up
to
such
a
destruction
of
the
will
or
such
an
overbearing
of
the
ability
of
this
juvenile
to
withstand
the
interrogation
as
to
constitute
an
enforced
coerced
or
wrung
out
confession.
we
think
that
on
the
total
record
and
on
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
taken
together
without
fragmentation
or
isolation
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
callous
disregard
of
the
rights
of
this
juvenile,
but
that
there
was
a
fair,
reasonable,
and
decent
regard
for
his
rights
and
that
this
confession
in
this
case
was
voluntary
and
should
be
sustained.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
he
is,
and
i
might
say
this
justice
harlan,
he
has
come
up
for
parole
three
or
four
times
and
he
has
been
turned
down
on
the
basis
of
poor
adjustment
and
i
can
also
say
this,
this
record
has
facts
in
here
that
are
a
little
cloudy
as
to
why
a
1957
adjudication
finally
came
before
the
appellant
division
in
new
jersey
in
1968
and
i
think
you're
entitled
to
know
why.
in
the
first
place
there
were
two
court
reporters
in
this
case.
immediately
after
the
adjudication
of
delinquency,
one
of
them
was
called
to
the
service
and
immediately
sent
overseas.
so
for
three
years
there
was
an
inability
to
get
the
part
of
the
transcript
prepared
which
this
reporter
had
taken.
and
we
have
in
new
jersey,
an
appeal
--
a
notice
of
appeal
have
been
filed
and
we
have
in
new
jersey
a
practice
where
periodically
the
clerk
issues
a
show
cause
for
a
dismissal
of
cases
which
have
not
been
prosecuted
as
the
rules
require
and
i
know
i
was
in
the
office
on
each
of
these
occasions.
this
young
man
would
be
consulted
and
would
consult
his
counsel,
would
go
and
see
him
at
the
board
and
town
reformatory
where
he
had
been
committed
originally.
and
he
would
say
to
his
counsel
i
don't
want
to
go
through
with
this
appeal
yet
but
see
if
you
can
hold
it
off
because
i'm
coming
up
for
parole
and
i
don't
want
this
to
interfere
with
my
parole.
well,
the
court
wouldn't
dismiss
the
appeal,
would
accept
this.
before
you
know
it
time
runs
by.
in
1967,
he
was
transferred
from
the
board
and
town
reformatory
to
state's
prison
which
i
call
the
post
graduate
elevation
where
he
undoubtedly
met
jail
house
lawyers
and
who
aided
and
assisted
him
in
filing
pro
se
in
the
appellant
division
in
august
1968,
an
application
to
revive
the
appeal
which
had
been
suspended
and
to
proceed
and
it
was
granted.
counsel
is
assigned,
case
was
argued,
appellant
division
decided
it
and
so
it
went
and
here
we
are.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
happened
justice
white
is
that
on
march
20th
he
was
committed
by
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
for
the
purse
snatching
for
which
he
was
arrested
on
february
the
16th,
the
board
and
town
reformatory,
for
an
indefinite
term.
and
it
was
while
he
was
in
board
and
town
and
after
he
had
--
their
complaint
had
been
filed
against
him
for
wise
and
giambra,
in
december
he
was
brought
from
board
and
town
reformatory
to
the
courthouse
that
sheltered
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
under
new
jersey
law,
he
would
be
detained
for
such
period
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
of
managers
at
board
and
town
reformatory
thought
him
to
be
ready
to
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
he
is
detained
at
the
children's
shelter
or
he
may
be
released
in
the
custody
of
his
parents
or
he
may
be
released
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
why
he
was
detained
after
february
16th
is
because
on
march
the
8th
this
--
or
march
the
2nd
or
3rd,
the
complaints
were
filed
in
wise
and
giambra
and
counsel
was
assigned
to
him.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
just
as
a
matter
of
--
for
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
by
that
i
don't
know
sir.
it
all
depends
upon
--
it
all
depends
upon
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
court
and
the
state
of
their
calendar
and
the
circumstances
and
he
might
have
been
detained
because
of
his
prior
involvement
in
other
juvenile
offenses
where
he
had
been
involved
and
likewise,
it
might
had
been
made
against
him
by
his
parents
for
having
runaway
from
home
so
that
this
young
man
was
not
the
ideal
youngster
for
release
to
the
streets.
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
well,
life
in
new
jersey
means
you
are
eligible
for
parole
after
13
and
a
half
years
and
he
has
practically
served
that.
although
in
this
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
in
this
instance
as
a
juvenile
--
as
a
juvenile,
he
was
eligible
for
parole
before
13
and
a
half
years.
in
fact
as
i
say,
he
has
been
up
for
a
parole
set
up
as
much
as
i
know
four
times.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
that's
my
best
judgment,
that's
my
best
judgment.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
yes,
indeed.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
under
the
1958
act
which
was
held
retroactive
even
though
he
was
adjudicated
in
1957
because
it
was
beneficial
to
the
juvenile
and
not
harmful,
because
for
the
first
time
it
did
away
for
indeterminate
sentences
in
the
case
of
juveniles
and
provided
for
fixed
terms
not
to
exceed
age
21
except
in
homicide.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
if
the
court
cares
for
argument
on
the
second
point
dealing
with
the
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
life
sentence,
otherwise,
i
would
rely
upon
my
brief
in
the
argument
contained
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
kreiger
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
justice
black
i'm
sure
--
you
will
find
that
in
the
trial
transcript
that's
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
because
this
appendix
was
an
abridged
matter.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
was
abridged
by
agreement
between
me
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
but
the
facts
concerning
his
prior
involvement
are
in
the
transcript
of
the
entire
trial
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
archibald
kreiger
your
clerk.
