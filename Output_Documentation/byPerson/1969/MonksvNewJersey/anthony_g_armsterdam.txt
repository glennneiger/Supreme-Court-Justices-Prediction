mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
presented
in
this
case
is
one
that
is
entirely
familiar
to
the
court.
it
is
the
question
which
this
court
has
wrestled
with
frequently,
for
better
than
35
years,
whether
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
or
in
this
instance
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
resulting
in
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
a
defendant's
confession
was
inadmissible
in
evidence
because
involuntarily
obtained
by
the
police.
this
case
arises
prior
to
the
cutoff
date
of
escobedo
and
of
miranda.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
there
is
no
miranda
argument
mr.
justice
harlan
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
issue
of
admissibility
of
the
confession
is
entirely
the
traditional
one
of
voluntariness
and
for
that
reason
it
turns
on
all
of
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
case.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
in
our
brief
i
have
tried
you
set
forth
in
all
of
the
detail
that
the
court
might
wish,
the
exact
factual
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained.
as
i
understand
the
state's
position,
in
its
brief,
it
initially
asserts
that
it
agrees
with
all
of
petitioner's
factual
statements.
however,
in
the
argument
portion
of
its
brief,
it
does
make
certain
factual
assertions
with
which
we
are
in
disagreement.
there
are
half
dozen
of
those
and
i
mean
to
advert
to
them
specifically
in
my
presentation
because
i
think
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
case
is
the
facts.
we
begin
with
what
is
clearly
a
major
factor
in
the
case
and
that
is
the
petitioner's
age.
at
the
time
of
his
detention,
interrogation
and
confession,
he
was
a
15-year
old,
to
be
exact,
15
years
and
four
months
old.
the
state
of
course
does
not
contest
that,
but
it
does
make
three
factual
assertions
in
that
regard
which
i
wish
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
first,
it
characterizes
the
petitioner
as
above
average,
and
indicates
that
he
had
an
intelligence
beyond
his
mere
age.
the
state
sights
nothing
in
the
record
for
either
these
propositions.
the
court
will
find
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
either
of
these
propositions
and
as
i
take
it,
it
is
an
inference
of
the
respondent
to
run
from
nothing
other
than
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
managed
the
hold
out
for
a
goodly
time
under
sustained
police
questioning.
the
second
factual
matter
raised
by
the
state
in
connection
with
the
petitioner's
individual
characteristics
is
that
he
was
as
the
state
puts
it,
court
wise
or
already
placed
in
its
brief
a
hardened
juvenile
criminal.
again,
the
record
shows
no
such
thing.
the
facts
in
this
regard
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
46
in
the
footnote
59.
the
trial
record
here
shows
only
that
the
petitioner
previous
to
this
detention
and
interrogation
had
been
a
probationer
of
the
juvenile
court.
it
does
not
show
what
caused
him
to
be
a
probationer
of
juvenile
court
and
it
does
not
show
what
context,
if
any,
he
had
had
with
the
police
incident
to
becoming
a
probationer
for
juvenile
court.
there
are
however
psychiatric
reports
in
this
record,
one
of
which
we
advert
to
in
that
footnote
which
shows
that
as
of
a
time
three
months
prior
to
his
detention,
the
only
run
ins
that
he
had
had
with
the
police
were
a
minor
pilfering
incidents,
stealing
flashlight
and
jacket
from
a
car,
a
broken
window
incident
and
some
misconduct
at
school.
in
reviewing
the
record
for
this
argument,
i
notice
that
i
omitted
from
that
footnote
that
the
same
diagnostic
report
also
indicates
a
charge
of
waywardness,
whatever
that
may
be,
some
time
prior
to
1953
when
he
would
have
been
11
or
12.
again,
no
indication
is
to
whether
he
had
dealings
with
the
police
in
that
connection
and
for
the
sake
of
completeness,
i
simply
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
there's
another
psychiatric
report
made
later
after
his
present
juvenile
commitment
in
which
under
sodium
amatol
interviews
and
a
methedrine
interview
at
the
state
diagnostic
center.
the
petitioner
also
adverted
to
two
additional
contacts
with
the
police,
however,
this
came
out
under
amatol.
it
is
quite
unclear
what
these
contacts
were
and
there
is
no
objective
verification
of
this
amatol
material.
in
any
event,
he
hardly
has
shown
by
this
record
to
be
a
hardened
juvenile
criminal.
finally,
the
state
says
that
the
petitioner
was
and
i
quote
“familiar
with
the
ability
to
take
refuge
in
silence.”
that
is
a
carefully
phrased
statement
to
the
extent
that
it
seems
to
assert
that
there
is
anything
in
this
record
showing
that
the
petitioner
knew
anything
about
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
his
right
to
resist
police
questioning.
it
is
again
totally
unfounded
in
the
record.
the
only
material
cited
by
the
state
to
support
it
is
a
statement
that
at
one
time
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
totally
silent
during
five
minutes
of
particularly
sustained
police
questioning.
no
indication
that
he
knew
of
his
right
to
maintain
and
retain
that
silence.
so,
i
think
what
we
end
up
with
in
terms
of
the
personality
in
nature
of
this
petitioner
is
that
he
was
simply
a
15-year
old
boy.
i
cannot
honestly
claim
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
is
subnormal,
but
i
think
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
is
super
normal
in
any
regard.
we
turn
then
to
what
happened
to
this
15-year
old
boy.
first,
it
is
undisputed
that
prior
to
the
interrogation
which
lead
to
his
confessions
he
was
detained
without
access
to
friends,
family,
or
an
attorney
for
a
10-day
period.
now,
i
am
quick
to
admit
that
this
detention
has
none
of
the
aggravating
trappings,
that
have
sometimes
attached
the
cases
coming
to
this
court,
no
shuttling
around
from
police
station
to
police
station
in
that
sort
of
thing.
he
was
simply
detained
in
the
juvenile
home
and
he
was
questioned
by
the
police
on
four
occasions;
one,
immediately
after
his
arrest
then
several
days
later
after
an
intervening
weekend
when
the
police
detention
on
him
focused
in
connection
with
these
cases,
then
as
soon
as
a
lie
detector
expert
could
be
gotten
and
finally,
several
days
later
on
the
day
in
which
he
confessed.
the
important
thing
however,
about
that
detention,
there
are
i
think
two
important
things
about
the
detention.
first,
it
shows
a
very
considerable
callousness
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
the
juvenile
authorities
and
indicates
that
they
were
far
more
concern
with
their
investigation
than
they
were
with
this
15-year
old's
welfare
and
that
of
his
family.
he
had
been
away
from
home
prior
to
his
arrest.
his
mother
had
called
the
police
and
had
called
the
juvenile
authorities
and
she
had
made
continuing
inquiries
of
them
and
had
been
assured
that
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up
he
would
be
brought
home.
in
fact,
when
he
was
picked
up,
he
was
detained
for
10
full
days
and
his
mother
never
learned
that
he
was
in
custody
until
the
newspapers
printed
that
he
had
confessed.
now,
the
state
suggests
and
here
is
the
fourth
matter
on
which
we
are
in
factual
disagreement
that
the
reason
why
monks
never
saw
his
parents
during
this
period
was
that
he
didn't
want
them.
again,
the
record
has
absolutely
no
support
for
this
proposition.
it
seems
to
be
an
inference
from
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
was
living
away
from
home.
however,
as
i
have
indicated,
his
mother
had
made
steps
to
find
him
both
through
the
police
and
through
the
juvenile
authorities.
they
knew
that
very
well
and
never
got
into
touch
with
her,
but
if
it
were
so
that
monks
was
so
far
from
his
parents
that
he
felt
that
not
even
that,
not
even
his
mother
and
his
father
could
be
called
to
help
him
in
this
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
speaks
not
strength
and
not
a
factor
which
supported
this
boy
in
his
ordeal
with
the
police,
but
rather
the
converse.
passing
from
that
aspect
of
the
continued
detention
to
another
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
it
is
mr.
chief
justice
i
think.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
please,
prior
to
the
recess
i
had
noted
the
petitioner's
10-day
detention
prior
to
the
interrogation
that
produced
this
confession.
the
most
important
result
of
that
10-day
detention
is
that
in
fact
and
to
petitioner's
appearance,
he
as
completely
subject
to
the
will
of
the
police
throughout
that
period.
he
was
not
being
detained
for
some
fixed
time
after
which
he
would
appear
in
court.
in
fact
and
as
far
as
he
knew
the
police
could
hold
him
and
question
him
whenever
they
pleased
until
he
confessed.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
in
a
juvenile
detention
home
for
this
10-day
period.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
they
--
there
is
no
indication
that
they
are
regularly
stationed
there.
when
he
was
arrested
and
before
he
was
taken
to
the
juvenile
home
he
was
questioned
for
several
hours
by
the
police.
indeed,
he
was
questioned
from
1
am
when
he
was
arrested
till
noon
the
following
day.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
we
have
only
two
days
of
police
interrogation
in
the
intervening
period
after
the
first
police
interrogation
and
prior
to
the
day
of
his
confession.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
yes,
he
was
arrested
in
connection
with
two
unrelated
purse
snatchings
to
which
he
admitted
immediately.
however,
he
was
being
held
from
all
appearances
for
questioning
on
these
offenses
because
the
police
officers
had
their
attention
called
immediately
to
a
similarity
of
modus
between
the
crimes.
and
on
the
monday
following
the
saturday
of
his
arrest,
they
began
to
question
him
on
these
two
particular
offenses.
they
applied
to
the
juvenile
court
for
leave
to
do
so,
they
were
granted
leave
to
do
so
and
they
began
to
do
so.
now,
here
we
come
to
perhaps
one
additional
factual
matter
in
which
we're
in
disagreement
with
the
state
because
we
believe
that
the
implication
to
him
was
obvious,
that
he
simply
had
no
right
to
refuse
to
answer
police
questions
and
that
the
police
would
persevere
in
holding
him
and
questioning
him
until
he
broke
and
confessed.
the
state
asserts
in
its
brief
that
the
police
in
fact
gave
petitioner
warnings
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
at
one
point.
the
state
citation
to
support
that
assertion
refers
entirely
to
a
warning
given
after
the
petitioner
had
been
questioned
on
three
days
and
during
12
hours
on
the
3rd
day
without
any
warning
or
caution
of
any
sort
from
the
police
at
any
time.
it
is
undisputed
that
he
was
never
given
any
warning
throughout
the
interrogation
until
he
had
twice
orally
confessed
to
the
offenses.
at
that
point
and
just
prior
to
the
formal
transcription
of
statements,
he
was
told
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
make
a
voluntary
statement
which
you
may
make
or
you
may
not
make
as
you
please
and
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
warnings
on
this
record.
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
he
did
not
know
and
was
not
told
at
any
time
anything
contrary
to
the
clear
indication
presented
by
the
police
continual
questioning
that
he
simply
was
going
to
have
to
answer.
now,
i
come
then
to
the
final
critical
date
and
time
is
very
important.
at
7
am
he
was
up,
before
7
am
he
was
up
because
he
had
breakfast
at
7.
at,
10
am
police
questioning
began.
the
confessions
were
completed
and
signed
at
1
am
the
following
day,
15
full
hours
after
the
interrogation
began.
now,
during
this
time,
he
was
--
no,
for
one
minute
out
of
the
presence
of
two
or
three
police
officers
except
when
he
was
being
interrogated
by
a
polygraph
operator,
never,
during
these
15
hours
did
he
see
or
speak
to
anybody
other
than
his
interrogators.
the
actual
amount
of
direct
interrogation
of
questioning
of
him
is
unclear
as
it
always
is
in
these
cases,
but
by
the
police
admissions,
the
minimum
possible
time
that
he
could
have
been
under
direct
questioning
was
six
and
a
half
or
seven
hours.
and
that
account
of
the
time
leaves
several
unexplained
gaps
in
the
day
as
is
invariable
with
testimony
regarding
to
these
--
regarding
matters
of
this
sort.
what
is
very
important
is
that
this
record
makes
clear
as
no
other
record
i
have
ever
seen
in
this
court,
what
was
going
on
throughout
the
15
hours
because
it
is
misleading
to
imagine
that
only
six
and
a
half
of
that
or
seven
of
that
involved
investigation
or
interrogation?
the
point
is
that
throughout
the
entire
15-hour
period
he
was
subject
to
the
stresses
and
pressures
of
the
interrogative
process.
while
he
was
not
being
questioned,
he
was
being
confronted
with
his
friends
who
were
brought
in
to
say
that
he
had
made
admissions
to
them.
they
were
undergoing
polygraph
testing
while
he
waited
outside
the
room
to
see
what
the
result
of
that
testing
would
be.
he
was
driven
around
to
the
scene
of
the
offenses.
he
was
told
to
sit
and
wait
while
the
police
officers
left
him,
went
across
the
room
and
in
his
presence
discussed
what
they
were
going
to
do
next.
all
of
this
time
he
was
undergoing
ongoing
process
of
police
interrogation.
so
that
the
15
hours
i
think
have
to
be
seen
as
a
block
under
which
this
15
year
old
boy
was
subjected
to
the
interrogative
process
and
all
of
its
pressures.
what
is
equally
important
is
that
he
persisted
from
the
very
beginning
in
denying
these
offenses.
this
is
not
one
of
these
threshold
confessions
by
anyone.
the
inquiry
here
is
whether
he
voluntarily
confessed,
whether
he
willfully
confessed.
now,
for
two
days
of
questioning
he
did
not.
for
12
hours
in
the
third
day
of
questioning
he
did
not.
he
confessed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
there
is
nothing,
not
only
not
enough
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
evidence
literally
pointing
to
his
guilt
other
than
his
confessions,
absolutely
none.
now,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
never,
and
that
is
the
one
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
and
that
is
the
one
legal
wrinkle
and
that
makes
this
case
different
from
any
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
that's
in
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
mean
to
come
to
that
because
i
think
that
is
nub
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
they
relate
to
the
wise
affair
which
is
an
affair
that's
not
now
an
issue
because
the
--
there
are
two
charges
here,
its
so
called
wise
affair
and
the
giambra
affair.
the
wise
affair,
he's
already
fully
served
all
the
time,
he
can
legally
under
new
jersey
law,
the
only
thing
that
is
in
contention
here
is
giambra.
now,
with
regard
to
giambra,
there
is
one
other
confession,
that
is
a
confession
or
an
admission
rather
made
to
not
a
friend
but
an
inmate
in
the
juvenile
home
following
and
clearly
derivative
of
all
the
confessions
that
are
in
contention
here.
one
could
not
find
on
this
record
that
that
confession
was
not
derivative
of
these.
if
these
confessions
fall
that
admission
clearly
must
fall.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
because
of
his
testimony;
he
was
explicitly
asked
on
cross
examination
by
the
district
attorney,
well,
why
did
you
tell
covan
in
the
receiving
home
that
had
done
it.
he
said,
i've
been
denying
it
all
along,
i
admitted
it
to
them
and
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag.
i
then
admitted
it
to
everybody.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
clear
implication
of
this
court's
holding
in
robinson
v.
tennessee
adopting
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
darwin
is
that
the
state
at
least
has
the
burden
after
a
first
involuntary
confession
is
given
of
showing
that
the
subsequent
confession
is
not
tainted
by
it
and
is
not
involuntary.
no
such
showing
is
possible
or
could
be
made
on
this
record.
i
do
not
assert
that
it
could
not
be
made.
i
assert
that
on
this
record
it
is
not
made.
now,
what
actually
went
on
in
the
course
of
the
police
questioning
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
this
might
follow
up.
again,
all
of
these
matters
here
are
detailed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
follow
up
is
simply
this,
that
petitioner
did
in
fact
have
a
black
leather
jacket.
the
victim's
description
was
a
man,
and
this
is
a
15
year
old
boy,
in
a
--
now,
it's
unclear
what
she
said.
the
officer
first
said
she
said
dark
leather
jacket
but
then
remembered
that
somebody
had
said
she
said
brown
leather
jacket,
monk's
jacket
was
black
and
the
jacket
was
equally
tainted
by
the
confession.
the
jacket
was
disclosed
immediately
following
the
confession
under
wong
sun,
there
would
be
no
question
whatever
that
the
jacket
would
fall
so
that
the
only
follow
up
again
derives
immediately
from
the
confession.
when
i
speak
of
there
being
no
independent
evidence
of
quilt,
i
mean
no
independent
of
this,
both
the
telling
admission
and
the
jacket
fall
with
this
confession,
but
in
any
event,
the
probative
value
of
the
defendant
having
a
black
jacket
and
the
victim
saying
that
she
was
hurt
by
a
man
with
the
dark
jacket
is
virtually
no.
now,
what
in
fact
happened
throughout
the
course
of
this
interrogation
was
that
the
defendant
simply
refused,
resisted
any
efforts
to
get
him
to
talk.
he
was
during
this
15
hours
subjected
to
confrontations
by
friends
in
connection
with
the
wise
matter,
put
on
a
lie
detector
nine
times,
was
confronted
with
a
prior
admission
in
the
wise
matter
being
knew
that
it
was
snowing
on
the
day
the
wise
offense
and
was
subjected
to
every
kind
of
blandishment
by
the
police
that
you
can't
fool
god
type
of
questioning,
that
you
will
feel
better
for
it,
the
sit
me
corner
and
search
your
conscience
type
of
thing
and
as
i
say
on
and
off
questioning
by
the
police
and
then
the
lie
detector
and
back
to
the
police
and
back
to
the
lie
detector.
now,
i
come
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
probation
officer
because
i
think
that
this
case
would
so
clearly
be
a
case
of
coerced
confession,
it
wouldn't
even
be
up
here,
if
it
weren't
for
the
probation
officer.
what
the
court
below,
both
court's
below
seem
to
have
done
is
to
rely
exclusively
on
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer
to
distinguish
this
case
from
haley,
and
as
i
read
the
respondent's
brief
almost
exclusive
reliance
is
placed
on
the
probation
officer
there
too.
so,
the
question
narrows
down
to
this,
whether
where
the
interrogation
itself
which
the
probation
officer
was
present
at
and
did
not
stop,
clearly
makes
a
case
of
coercion
under
haley,
whether
his
mere
presence
doing
nothing
changes
the
result
and
somehow
makes
the
confession
voluntary.
now
in
that
regard,
i
have
several
specific
factual
points.
one;
the
probation
officer
was
simply
not
there
during
the
critical
times.
although,
he
had
been
instructed
by
the
court
to
be
present
when
the
petitioner
was
interrogated
by
the
officers,
he
seems
to
have
construed
this
as
not
including
the
polygraph
operator.
with
the
result
that
the
three
and
a
half
hours
of
interrogation
that
went
on,
on
the
26th
alone,
the
critical
day
alone
by
the
polygraph
operator
during
one
of
which
he
finally
broke
and
started
to
make
the
confession
the
giambra
confession,
these
were
sessions
where
the
probation
officer
was
not
present.
when
he
finally
did
break,
who
was
brought
in?
not
the
probation
officer,
but
the
investigating
detective
and
he
then
proceeded
to
make
his
initial
confession
to
the
detective
again
out
of
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
why?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
whe
--
where?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
simply
assume
that
he
didn't
regard
the
polygraph
operator
as
a
detective.
i
can't
understand
why
he
wasn't
present.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
oh,
i'm
sorry,
he
was
in
the
next
room,
as
he
says.
that
is
this
--
the
questioning
went
on
in
what
appears
to
be
in
a
small
room,
in
any
room
to
the
grand
jury.
he
was
in
the
next
room.
no
indication
as
to
whether
one
could
hear
and
in
fact
the
door
was
closed
so
one
would
suppose
that
he
couldn't
hear
in
and
was
not
supporting
by
his
presence,
the
petitioner
in
any
way.
now,
the
respondent
states
that
the
state
courts
below
made
what
the
respondent
calls
express
findings
that
the
probation
officer's
presence
was
a
restraining
influence
on
the
police.
let
me
make
that
very
clear.
the
state
courts
below
made
no
such
express
findings
and
could
not
on
this
record
have
done
so.
what
the
state
courts
did
was
simply
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
was
assigned
by
the
court
and
was
sometimes
there
as
making
his
confession
voluntary.
it
made
no
findings
that
he
had
any
impact
on
the
police
and
indeed
no
findings
of
that
sort
could
be
made
because
he
never
said
a
word,
never
stopped
the
police
from
doing
anything,
never
interjected,
there's
no
testimony
by
the
police
that
they
regarded
him
as
a
restraining
influence
in
short,
he
was
simply
there.
more
importantly,
the
petitioner
was
never
told
that
he
was
there
to
protect
him.
he
knew
that
he
was
a
probation
officer
but
a
juvenile's
view
of
a
juvenile
probation
officer
clearly
allies
him
with
the
police
and
there
was
no
suggestion
communicated
to
monks
that
he
was
there
in
protective
role.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
this
point
is
exceedingly
important.
that
when
it
came
to
trial,
the
probation
officer
was
not
a
supportive
or
a
friendly
figure.
he
was
hostile
to
the
petitioner,
he
was
heedless
of
the
facts
dealing
the
circumstances
of
the
confession.
he
admitted
he
didn't
listen
to
any
of
the
details
of
the
questioning
or
the
answers.
he
simply
regarded
his
own
role,
protection
of
himself
as
what
was
important.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
only
thing
he
told
the
petitioner
was
that
if
he
did
ought
to
say
so.
he
did
not
tell
the
petitioner
anything.
the
petitioner
admitted
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
absolutely
not.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
this.
at
one
point
there
is
a
leading
question
by
the
court
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
does
not
know
that
these
juvenile
probation
officers
are
there
to
help
juveniles
and
the
petitioner
says
yes
i
know
that.
but
if
it
wasn't
this
probation
officer
or
anything
else,
now
that
is
simply
the
juvenile
court
mistake.
i
think
this
court
need
attach
no
significance
to
it.
it
certainly
doesn't
communicate
helping
him
in
what
way
and
the
respondent
in
this
court
asserts
that
he
was
not
there
to
help
and
support
in
refusing
to
answer
questions
or
assert
his
privilege
if
he
felt
like
it.
the
respondent
rightly
points
out
that
we
have
great
concerns
for
the
probation
officer's
role
here.
we
think
that
he
was
heedless
at
the
least
of
his
role
and
possibly
mendacious.
and
i
say
that
not
quite
comparing
his
testimony
with
that
of
the
petitioner,
but
by
comparing
his
testimony
with
that
of
the
police
officers
who
sometimes
testified
that
he
was
under
interrogation
three
or
four
times
as
long
as
the
probation
officer
admitted.
and
by
comparing
his
own
testimony
internally
which
shows
total
heedlessness
of
any
protective
role.
the
question
then
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
is
that
not
whether
any
protective
figure
may
prevent
a
confession
from
being
involuntary,
but
whether
the
presence
of
a
figure
who
does
nothing
make
to
stop
clearly
towards
a
police
questioning,
who
is
not
known
to
the
petitioner
and
to
be
there
in
a
protective
role
and
who
serves
no
function
as
an
impartial
observer
in
any
way,
prevents
and
otherwise
coerced
confession
from
being
found
coerced,
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
will
do
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
if
i
may
just
advert
briefly
into
the
questions
the
court
ask
in
the
statements
of
mr.
kreiger,
i
have
five
very
short
factual
matters
and
i'll
get
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question's
aspect.
first
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
mr.
kreiger
stated
initially
that
during
the
10
days,
the
boy
was
being
held
on
those
other
purse
snatching,
he
then
admitted
in
effect
that
that
was
not
so.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
will
support
the
contention
that
he
was
being
held
in
connection
with
other
purse
snatchings.
the
record
states
nothing
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
arrested
for
those,
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
taken
into
custody,
correct,
but
as
mr.
kreiger
has
stated,
new
jersey
law
would
leave
unclear
whether
he
should
be
released
under
that
situation
and
the
clear
implication
here
is
that
he
was
held
because
he
was
being
investigated
for
the
wise
and
giambra
matters.
secondly,
mr.
kreiger's
statement
that
the
boy
was
estranged
from
his
family
and
that
that
explains
to
mr.
justice
marshall
why
the
mother
wasn't
called.
the
mother
had
contacted
the
police
two
or
three
times,
the
juvenile
authorities
more
asking
that
this
boy
be
brought
home
when
he
was
picked
up
and
both
the
police
and
the
juvenile
authorities
knew
that
and
the
parents
were
not
contacted.
third,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
about
whether
he
was
told
about
the
probation
officer's
role.
mr.
kreiger
has
said
that
he
will
file
something
responsive
to
that,
i
think
the
court
will
find
at
pages
200
and
201
of
the
appendix
all
that
there
is.
it
supports
my
statement
that
he
knew
that
the
probation
officer
was
a
probation
officer,
had
been
assigned
to
“stay
with
him”
and
that's
it.
finally,
--
no,
two
more
points.
first,
mr.
kreiger's
statement
as
to
what
the
probation
officer
told
the
boy.
this
is
on
page
90
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
good
probation
officer
advice.
i
took
advantage
of
one
of
the
respects
in
questioning,
one
of
these
episodes
to
ask
the
boy
that
if
he
really
knew
anything
about
these
offenses
that
he
should
unburden
himself
and
search
his
conscience
and
that
he
would
feel
much
better
if
he
told
it
because
he
would
have
to
live
with
it
the
rest
of
his
life,
the
sort
of
counseling
i
would
give
any
boy
in
the
juvenile
court.
that's
the
support
and
assistance
of
the
probation
officer.
finally,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
black's
question.
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
you
will
not
find
in
the
record,
the
original
record
any
indication
of
a
number
of
prior
incidents
of
this
boy.
the
record
only
shows
that
he
was
a
probationer
of
the
juvenile
court
at
the
time
that
he
was
picked
up
here.
it
shows
nothing
about
the
number,
frequency,
reasons
for
his
being
in
probation.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
record.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
believe
that
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
believe
that's
correct.
now,
if
i
may
speak
very
briefly
having
only
a
minute
left
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
point.
we
think
that
the
sentencing
question
is
a
fairly
straight
forward
application
in
respect
in
patterson
with
one
wrinkle.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
this
boy's
maximum
sentence
was
determined
subsequent
to
his
original
trial
that
a
finding
was
made
which
was
neither
required
nor
in
fact
made
at
the
original
juvenile
trial,
which
was
that
he
was
adjudicated
a
delinquent
on
the
basis
of
an
offense
which
would
be
first
degree
murder.
that
involves
findings
not
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
within
the
meaning
of
speck,
a
new
fact.
under
new
jersey
law,
evidence
is
admissible
going
to
that
fact,
such
as
evidence
of
diminished
capacity,
in
this
case
psychiatric
evidence
which
was
not
put
in
by
his
counsel
as
it
should
not
have
been
at
the
original
trial
since
it
didn't
matter
what
degree
of
homicide.
he
was
found
guilty
of
as
a
juvenile
prior
to
the
new
statute.
now,
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
or
not
speck
applies
if
the
new
finding
of
fact
is
required
not
by
antecedent
legislation,
but
by
subsequent
legislation
which
state
law
chooses
to
make
retroactive.
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
makes
no
difference
whatever.
it
is
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
has
chosen
to
said
that
a
differentiation
between
two
classes
of
people
should
be
made,
those
who
have
been
found
guilty
of
first
degree
of
homicide
and
those
who
have
lesser
degrees.
the
difference
is
critical.
the
difference
in
this
case
was
the
difference
between
six
years
in
prison,
this
boy
would
have
been
released
sever
years
ago,
and
a
life
sentence,
that
fact
is
a
critical
fact
it
was
not
an
issue.
the
state
has
put
it
in
issue
by
the
new
legislation
and
we
think
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
hearing
on
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
juvenile
delinquency?
the
charges
were
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
not
guilty,
i
didn't
do
it,
but
that
went
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
yes,
an
alibi
that's
correct.
however
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
i
disagree
with
the
state
entirely
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
diminished
capacity
because
you
don't
have
to
admit
anything
to
show
the
juvenile
judge
or
your
jury
what
the
nature
of
the
defendant
is.
it's
not
like
the
defense
of
consent
in
a
rape
case
which
isn't
consistent
with
alibi.
to
simply
show
the
court
that
they're
dealing
with
a
juvenile
who
may
be
defective,
retarded.
remember,
the
court
here
ordered
psychiatric
treatment
for
this
boy
when
it
originally
committed
him,
simply
tells
the
court
that
if
he
did
do
it
which
he
says
he
didn't
do
that
he
hasn't
got
the
capacity
to
be
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
no
inconsistency
there,
any
good
trial
there
could
present
those
two
facts.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
in
the
initial
proceeding
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
must
admit
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
perhaps
mr.
kreiger
could
enlighten
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no
issue
has
been
made
of
this
below
and
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
have
--
all
i
can
say
is
to
that
i'll
be
glad
to
find
it
out
and
submit
unless
mr.
kreiger
knows
the
answer
to
that
question,
submit
it
to
the
court
and
write
it.
no
issue
of
it
having
been
made
below,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
presented
in
this
case
is
one
that
is
entirely
familiar
to
the
court.
it
is
the
question
which
this
court
has
wrestled
with
frequently,
for
better
than
35
years,
whether
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding
or
in
this
instance
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
resulting
in
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
a
defendant's
confession
was
inadmissible
in
evidence
because
involuntarily
obtained
by
the
police.
this
case
arises
prior
to
the
cutoff
date
of
escobedo
and
of
miranda.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
there
is
no
miranda
argument
mr.
justice
harlan
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
issue
of
admissibility
of
the
confession
is
entirely
the
traditional
one
of
voluntariness
and
for
that
reason
it
turns
on
all
of
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
case.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
in
our
brief
i
have
tried
you
set
forth
in
all
of
the
detail
that
the
court
might
wish,
the
exact
factual
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained.
as
i
understand
the
state's
position,
in
its
brief,
it
initially
asserts
that
it
agrees
with
all
of
petitioner's
factual
statements.
however,
in
the
argument
portion
of
its
brief,
it
does
make
certain
factual
assertions
with
which
we
are
in
disagreement.
there
are
half
dozen
of
those
and
i
mean
to
advert
to
them
specifically
in
my
presentation
because
i
think
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
case
is
the
facts.
we
begin
with
what
is
clearly
a
major
factor
in
the
case
and
that
is
the
petitioner's
age.
at
the
time
of
his
detention,
interrogation
and
confession,
he
was
a
15-year
old,
to
be
exact,
15
years
and
four
months
old.
the
state
of
course
does
not
contest
that,
but
it
does
make
three
factual
assertions
in
that
regard
which
i
wish
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
first,
it
characterizes
the
petitioner
as
above
average,
and
indicates
that
he
had
an
intelligence
beyond
his
mere
age.
the
state
sights
nothing
in
the
record
for
either
these
propositions.
the
court
will
find
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
either
of
these
propositions
and
as
i
take
it,
it
is
an
inference
of
the
respondent
to
run
from
nothing
other
than
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
managed
the
hold
out
for
a
goodly
time
under
sustained
police
questioning.
the
second
factual
matter
raised
by
the
state
in
connection
with
the
petitioner's
individual
characteristics
is
that
he
was
as
the
state
puts
it,
court
wise
or
already
placed
in
its
brief
a
hardened
juvenile
criminal.
again,
the
record
shows
no
such
thing.
the
facts
in
this
regard
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
46
in
the
footnote
59.
the
trial
record
here
shows
only
that
the
petitioner
previous
to
this
detention
and
interrogation
had
been
a
probationer
of
the
juvenile
court.
it
does
not
show
what
caused
him
to
be
a
probationer
of
juvenile
court
and
it
does
not
show
what
context,
if
any,
he
had
had
with
the
police
incident
to
becoming
a
probationer
for
juvenile
court.
there
are
however
psychiatric
reports
in
this
record,
one
of
which
we
advert
to
in
that
footnote
which
shows
that
as
of
a
time
three
months
prior
to
his
detention,
the
only
run
ins
that
he
had
had
with
the
police
were
a
minor
pilfering
incidents,
stealing
flashlight
and
jacket
from
a
car,
a
broken
window
incident
and
some
misconduct
at
school.
in
reviewing
the
record
for
this
argument,
i
notice
that
i
omitted
from
that
footnote
that
the
same
diagnostic
report
also
indicates
a
charge
of
waywardness,
whatever
that
may
be,
some
time
prior
to
1953
when
he
would
have
been
11
or
12.
again,
no
indication
is
to
whether
he
had
dealings
with
the
police
in
that
connection
and
for
the
sake
of
completeness,
i
simply
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
there's
another
psychiatric
report
made
later
after
his
present
juvenile
commitment
in
which
under
sodium
amatol
interviews
and
a
methedrine
interview
at
the
state
diagnostic
center.
the
petitioner
also
adverted
to
two
additional
contacts
with
the
police,
however,
this
came
out
under
amatol.
it
is
quite
unclear
what
these
contacts
were
and
there
is
no
objective
verification
of
this
amatol
material.
in
any
event,
he
hardly
has
shown
by
this
record
to
be
a
hardened
juvenile
criminal.
finally,
the
state
says
that
the
petitioner
was
and
i
quote
“familiar
with
the
ability
to
take
refuge
in
silence.”
that
is
a
carefully
phrased
statement
to
the
extent
that
it
seems
to
assert
that
there
is
anything
in
this
record
showing
that
the
petitioner
knew
anything
about
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
his
right
to
resist
police
questioning.
it
is
again
totally
unfounded
in
the
record.
the
only
material
cited
by
the
state
to
support
it
is
a
statement
that
at
one
time
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
totally
silent
during
five
minutes
of
particularly
sustained
police
questioning.
no
indication
that
he
knew
of
his
right
to
maintain
and
retain
that
silence.
so,
i
think
what
we
end
up
with
in
terms
of
the
personality
in
nature
of
this
petitioner
is
that
he
was
simply
a
15-year
old
boy.
i
cannot
honestly
claim
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
is
subnormal,
but
i
think
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
is
super
normal
in
any
regard.
we
turn
then
to
what
happened
to
this
15-year
old
boy.
first,
it
is
undisputed
that
prior
to
the
interrogation
which
lead
to
his
confessions
he
was
detained
without
access
to
friends,
family,
or
an
attorney
for
a
10-day
period.
now,
i
am
quick
to
admit
that
this
detention
has
none
of
the
aggravating
trappings,
that
have
sometimes
attached
the
cases
coming
to
this
court,
no
shuttling
around
from
police
station
to
police
station
in
that
sort
of
thing.
he
was
simply
detained
in
the
juvenile
home
and
he
was
questioned
by
the
police
on
four
occasions;
one,
immediately
after
his
arrest
then
several
days
later
after
an
intervening
weekend
when
the
police
detention
on
him
focused
in
connection
with
these
cases,
then
as
soon
as
a
lie
detector
expert
could
be
gotten
and
finally,
several
days
later
on
the
day
in
which
he
confessed.
the
important
thing
however,
about
that
detention,
there
are
i
think
two
important
things
about
the
detention.
first,
it
shows
a
very
considerable
callousness
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
the
juvenile
authorities
and
indicates
that
they
were
far
more
concern
with
their
investigation
than
they
were
with
this
15-year
old's
welfare
and
that
of
his
family.
he
had
been
away
from
home
prior
to
his
arrest.
his
mother
had
called
the
police
and
had
called
the
juvenile
authorities
and
she
had
made
continuing
inquiries
of
them
and
had
been
assured
that
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up
he
would
be
brought
home.
in
fact,
when
he
was
picked
up,
he
was
detained
for
10
full
days
and
his
mother
never
learned
that
he
was
in
custody
until
the
newspapers
printed
that
he
had
confessed.
now,
the
state
suggests
and
here
is
the
fourth
matter
on
which
we
are
in
factual
disagreement
that
the
reason
why
monks
never
saw
his
parents
during
this
period
was
that
he
didn't
want
them.
again,
the
record
has
absolutely
no
support
for
this
proposition.
it
seems
to
be
an
inference
from
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
was
living
away
from
home.
however,
as
i
have
indicated,
his
mother
had
made
steps
to
find
him
both
through
the
police
and
through
the
juvenile
authorities.
they
knew
that
very
well
and
never
got
into
touch
with
her,
but
if
it
were
so
that
monks
was
so
far
from
his
parents
that
he
felt
that
not
even
that,
not
even
his
mother
and
his
father
could
be
called
to
help
him
in
this
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that
speaks
not
strength
and
not
a
factor
which
supported
this
boy
in
his
ordeal
with
the
police,
but
rather
the
converse.
passing
from
that
aspect
of
the
continued
detention
to
another
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
it
is
mr.
chief
justice
i
think.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
please,
prior
to
the
recess
i
had
noted
the
petitioner's
10-day
detention
prior
to
the
interrogation
that
produced
this
confession.
the
most
important
result
of
that
10-day
detention
is
that
in
fact
and
to
petitioner's
appearance,
he
as
completely
subject
to
the
will
of
the
police
throughout
that
period.
he
was
not
being
detained
for
some
fixed
time
after
which
he
would
appear
in
court.
in
fact
and
as
far
as
he
knew
the
police
could
hold
him
and
question
him
whenever
they
pleased
until
he
confessed.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
in
a
juvenile
detention
home
for
this
10-day
period.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
they
--
there
is
no
indication
that
they
are
regularly
stationed
there.
when
he
was
arrested
and
before
he
was
taken
to
the
juvenile
home
he
was
questioned
for
several
hours
by
the
police.
indeed,
he
was
questioned
from
1
am
when
he
was
arrested
till
noon
the
following
day.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
we
have
only
two
days
of
police
interrogation
in
the
intervening
period
after
the
first
police
interrogation
and
prior
to
the
day
of
his
confession.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
yes,
he
was
arrested
in
connection
with
two
unrelated
purse
snatchings
to
which
he
admitted
immediately.
however,
he
was
being
held
from
all
appearances
for
questioning
on
these
offenses
because
the
police
officers
had
their
attention
called
immediately
to
a
similarity
of
modus
between
the
crimes.
and
on
the
monday
following
the
saturday
of
his
arrest,
they
began
to
question
him
on
these
two
particular
offenses.
they
applied
to
the
juvenile
court
for
leave
to
do
so,
they
were
granted
leave
to
do
so
and
they
began
to
do
so.
now,
here
we
come
to
perhaps
one
additional
factual
matter
in
which
we're
in
disagreement
with
the
state
because
we
believe
that
the
implication
to
him
was
obvious,
that
he
simply
had
no
right
to
refuse
to
answer
police
questions
and
that
the
police
would
persevere
in
holding
him
and
questioning
him
until
he
broke
and
confessed.
the
state
asserts
in
its
brief
that
the
police
in
fact
gave
petitioner
warnings
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
at
one
point.
the
state
citation
to
support
that
assertion
refers
entirely
to
a
warning
given
after
the
petitioner
had
been
questioned
on
three
days
and
during
12
hours
on
the
3rd
day
without
any
warning
or
caution
of
any
sort
from
the
police
at
any
time.
it
is
undisputed
that
he
was
never
given
any
warning
throughout
the
interrogation
until
he
had
twice
orally
confessed
to
the
offenses.
at
that
point
and
just
prior
to
the
formal
transcription
of
statements,
he
was
told
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
make
a
voluntary
statement
which
you
may
make
or
you
may
not
make
as
you
please
and
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
warnings
on
this
record.
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
he
did
not
know
and
was
not
told
at
any
time
anything
contrary
to
the
clear
indication
presented
by
the
police
continual
questioning
that
he
simply
was
going
to
have
to
answer.
now,
i
come
then
to
the
final
critical
date
and
time
is
very
important.
at
7
am
he
was
up,
before
7
am
he
was
up
because
he
had
breakfast
at
7.
at,
10
am
police
questioning
began.
the
confessions
were
completed
and
signed
at
1
am
the
following
day,
15
full
hours
after
the
interrogation
began.
now,
during
this
time,
he
was
--
no,
for
one
minute
out
of
the
presence
of
two
or
three
police
officers
except
when
he
was
being
interrogated
by
a
polygraph
operator,
never,
during
these
15
hours
did
he
see
or
speak
to
anybody
other
than
his
interrogators.
the
actual
amount
of
direct
interrogation
of
questioning
of
him
is
unclear
as
it
always
is
in
these
cases,
but
by
the
police
admissions,
the
minimum
possible
time
that
he
could
have
been
under
direct
questioning
was
six
and
a
half
or
seven
hours.
and
that
account
of
the
time
leaves
several
unexplained
gaps
in
the
day
as
is
invariable
with
testimony
regarding
to
these
--
regarding
matters
of
this
sort.
what
is
very
important
is
that
this
record
makes
clear
as
no
other
record
i
have
ever
seen
in
this
court,
what
was
going
on
throughout
the
15
hours
because
it
is
misleading
to
imagine
that
only
six
and
a
half
of
that
or
seven
of
that
involved
investigation
or
interrogation?
the
point
is
that
throughout
the
entire
15-hour
period
he
was
subject
to
the
stresses
and
pressures
of
the
interrogative
process.
while
he
was
not
being
questioned,
he
was
being
confronted
with
his
friends
who
were
brought
in
to
say
that
he
had
made
admissions
to
them.
they
were
undergoing
polygraph
testing
while
he
waited
outside
the
room
to
see
what
the
result
of
that
testing
would
be.
he
was
driven
around
to
the
scene
of
the
offenses.
he
was
told
to
sit
and
wait
while
the
police
officers
left
him,
went
across
the
room
and
in
his
presence
discussed
what
they
were
going
to
do
next.
all
of
this
time
he
was
undergoing
ongoing
process
of
police
interrogation.
so
that
the
15
hours
i
think
have
to
be
seen
as
a
block
under
which
this
15
year
old
boy
was
subjected
to
the
interrogative
process
and
all
of
its
pressures.
what
is
equally
important
is
that
he
persisted
from
the
very
beginning
in
denying
these
offenses.
this
is
not
one
of
these
threshold
confessions
by
anyone.
the
inquiry
here
is
whether
he
voluntarily
confessed,
whether
he
willfully
confessed.
now,
for
two
days
of
questioning
he
did
not.
for
12
hours
in
the
third
day
of
questioning
he
did
not.
he
confessed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
there
is
nothing,
not
only
not
enough
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
evidence
literally
pointing
to
his
guilt
other
than
his
confessions,
absolutely
none.
now,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
never,
and
that
is
the
one
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
and
that
is
the
one
legal
wrinkle
and
that
makes
this
case
different
from
any
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
that's
in
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
not
that
i
know
of.
i
mean
to
come
to
that
because
i
think
that
is
nub
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
they
relate
to
the
wise
affair
which
is
an
affair
that's
not
now
an
issue
because
the
--
there
are
two
charges
here,
its
so
called
wise
affair
and
the
giambra
affair.
the
wise
affair,
he's
already
fully
served
all
the
time,
he
can
legally
under
new
jersey
law,
the
only
thing
that
is
in
contention
here
is
giambra.
now,
with
regard
to
giambra,
there
is
one
other
confession,
that
is
a
confession
or
an
admission
rather
made
to
not
a
friend
but
an
inmate
in
the
juvenile
home
following
and
clearly
derivative
of
all
the
confessions
that
are
in
contention
here.
one
could
not
find
on
this
record
that
that
confession
was
not
derivative
of
these.
if
these
confessions
fall
that
admission
clearly
must
fall.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
because
of
his
testimony;
he
was
explicitly
asked
on
cross
examination
by
the
district
attorney,
well,
why
did
you
tell
covan
in
the
receiving
home
that
had
done
it.
he
said,
i've
been
denying
it
all
along,
i
admitted
it
to
them
and
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag.
i
then
admitted
it
to
everybody.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
clear
implication
of
this
court's
holding
in
robinson
v.
tennessee
adopting
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
darwin
is
that
the
state
at
least
has
the
burden
after
a
first
involuntary
confession
is
given
of
showing
that
the
subsequent
confession
is
not
tainted
by
it
and
is
not
involuntary.
no
such
showing
is
possible
or
could
be
made
on
this
record.
i
do
not
assert
that
it
could
not
be
made.
i
assert
that
on
this
record
it
is
not
made.
now,
what
actually
went
on
in
the
course
of
the
police
questioning
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
this
might
follow
up.
again,
all
of
these
matters
here
are
detailed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
follow
up
is
simply
this,
that
petitioner
did
in
fact
have
a
black
leather
jacket.
the
victim's
description
was
a
man,
and
this
is
a
15
year
old
boy,
in
a
--
now,
it's
unclear
what
she
said.
the
officer
first
said
she
said
dark
leather
jacket
but
then
remembered
that
somebody
had
said
she
said
brown
leather
jacket,
monk's
jacket
was
black
and
the
jacket
was
equally
tainted
by
the
confession.
the
jacket
was
disclosed
immediately
following
the
confession
under
wong
sun,
there
would
be
no
question
whatever
that
the
jacket
would
fall
so
that
the
only
follow
up
again
derives
immediately
from
the
confession.
when
i
speak
of
there
being
no
independent
evidence
of
quilt,
i
mean
no
independent
of
this,
both
the
telling
admission
and
the
jacket
fall
with
this
confession,
but
in
any
event,
the
probative
value
of
the
defendant
having
a
black
jacket
and
the
victim
saying
that
she
was
hurt
by
a
man
with
the
dark
jacket
is
virtually
no.
now,
what
in
fact
happened
throughout
the
course
of
this
interrogation
was
that
the
defendant
simply
refused,
resisted
any
efforts
to
get
him
to
talk.
he
was
during
this
15
hours
subjected
to
confrontations
by
friends
in
connection
with
the
wise
matter,
put
on
a
lie
detector
nine
times,
was
confronted
with
a
prior
admission
in
the
wise
matter
being
knew
that
it
was
snowing
on
the
day
the
wise
offense
and
was
subjected
to
every
kind
of
blandishment
by
the
police
that
you
can't
fool
god
type
of
questioning,
that
you
will
feel
better
for
it,
the
sit
me
corner
and
search
your
conscience
type
of
thing
and
as
i
say
on
and
off
questioning
by
the
police
and
then
the
lie
detector
and
back
to
the
police
and
back
to
the
lie
detector.
now,
i
come
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
probation
officer
because
i
think
that
this
case
would
so
clearly
be
a
case
of
coerced
confession,
it
wouldn't
even
be
up
here,
if
it
weren't
for
the
probation
officer.
what
the
court
below,
both
court's
below
seem
to
have
done
is
to
rely
exclusively
on
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer
to
distinguish
this
case
from
haley,
and
as
i
read
the
respondent's
brief
almost
exclusive
reliance
is
placed
on
the
probation
officer
there
too.
so,
the
question
narrows
down
to
this,
whether
where
the
interrogation
itself
which
the
probation
officer
was
present
at
and
did
not
stop,
clearly
makes
a
case
of
coercion
under
haley,
whether
his
mere
presence
doing
nothing
changes
the
result
and
somehow
makes
the
confession
voluntary.
now
in
that
regard,
i
have
several
specific
factual
points.
one;
the
probation
officer
was
simply
not
there
during
the
critical
times.
although,
he
had
been
instructed
by
the
court
to
be
present
when
the
petitioner
was
interrogated
by
the
officers,
he
seems
to
have
construed
this
as
not
including
the
polygraph
operator.
with
the
result
that
the
three
and
a
half
hours
of
interrogation
that
went
on,
on
the
26th
alone,
the
critical
day
alone
by
the
polygraph
operator
during
one
of
which
he
finally
broke
and
started
to
make
the
confession
the
giambra
confession,
these
were
sessions
where
the
probation
officer
was
not
present.
when
he
finally
did
break,
who
was
brought
in?
not
the
probation
officer,
but
the
investigating
detective
and
he
then
proceeded
to
make
his
initial
confession
to
the
detective
again
out
of
the
presence
of
the
probation
officer.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
why?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
whe
--
where?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
simply
assume
that
he
didn't
regard
the
polygraph
operator
as
a
detective.
i
can't
understand
why
he
wasn't
present.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
oh,
i'm
sorry,
he
was
in
the
next
room,
as
he
says.
that
is
this
--
the
questioning
went
on
in
what
appears
to
be
in
a
small
room,
in
any
room
to
the
grand
jury.
he
was
in
the
next
room.
no
indication
as
to
whether
one
could
hear
and
in
fact
the
door
was
closed
so
one
would
suppose
that
he
couldn't
hear
in
and
was
not
supporting
by
his
presence,
the
petitioner
in
any
way.
now,
the
respondent
states
that
the
state
courts
below
made
what
the
respondent
calls
express
findings
that
the
probation
officer's
presence
was
a
restraining
influence
on
the
police.
let
me
make
that
very
clear.
the
state
courts
below
made
no
such
express
findings
and
could
not
on
this
record
have
done
so.
what
the
state
courts
did
was
simply
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
was
assigned
by
the
court
and
was
sometimes
there
as
making
his
confession
voluntary.
it
made
no
findings
that
he
had
any
impact
on
the
police
and
indeed
no
findings
of
that
sort
could
be
made
because
he
never
said
a
word,
never
stopped
the
police
from
doing
anything,
never
interjected,
there's
no
testimony
by
the
police
that
they
regarded
him
as
a
restraining
influence
in
short,
he
was
simply
there.
more
importantly,
the
petitioner
was
never
told
that
he
was
there
to
protect
him.
he
knew
that
he
was
a
probation
officer
but
a
juvenile's
view
of
a
juvenile
probation
officer
clearly
allies
him
with
the
police
and
there
was
no
suggestion
communicated
to
monks
that
he
was
there
in
protective
role.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
this
point
is
exceedingly
important.
that
when
it
came
to
trial,
the
probation
officer
was
not
a
supportive
or
a
friendly
figure.
he
was
hostile
to
the
petitioner,
he
was
heedless
of
the
facts
dealing
the
circumstances
of
the
confession.
he
admitted
he
didn't
listen
to
any
of
the
details
of
the
questioning
or
the
answers.
he
simply
regarded
his
own
role,
protection
of
himself
as
what
was
important.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
only
thing
he
told
the
petitioner
was
that
if
he
did
ought
to
say
so.
he
did
not
tell
the
petitioner
anything.
the
petitioner
admitted
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
absolutely
not.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
this.
at
one
point
there
is
a
leading
question
by
the
court
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
does
not
know
that
these
juvenile
probation
officers
are
there
to
help
juveniles
and
the
petitioner
says
yes
i
know
that.
but
if
it
wasn't
this
probation
officer
or
anything
else,
now
that
is
simply
the
juvenile
court
mistake.
i
think
this
court
need
attach
no
significance
to
it.
it
certainly
doesn't
communicate
helping
him
in
what
way
and
the
respondent
in
this
court
asserts
that
he
was
not
there
to
help
and
support
in
refusing
to
answer
questions
or
assert
his
privilege
if
he
felt
like
it.
the
respondent
rightly
points
out
that
we
have
great
concerns
for
the
probation
officer's
role
here.
we
think
that
he
was
heedless
at
the
least
of
his
role
and
possibly
mendacious.
and
i
say
that
not
quite
comparing
his
testimony
with
that
of
the
petitioner,
but
by
comparing
his
testimony
with
that
of
the
police
officers
who
sometimes
testified
that
he
was
under
interrogation
three
or
four
times
as
long
as
the
probation
officer
admitted.
and
by
comparing
his
own
testimony
internally
which
shows
total
heedlessness
of
any
protective
role.
the
question
then
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
is
that
not
whether
any
protective
figure
may
prevent
a
confession
from
being
involuntary,
but
whether
the
presence
of
a
figure
who
does
nothing
make
to
stop
clearly
towards
a
police
questioning,
who
is
not
known
to
the
petitioner
and
to
be
there
in
a
protective
role
and
who
serves
no
function
as
an
impartial
observer
in
any
way,
prevents
and
otherwise
coerced
confession
from
being
found
coerced,
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
will
do
that
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
if
i
may
just
advert
briefly
into
the
questions
the
court
ask
in
the
statements
of
mr.
kreiger,
i
have
five
very
short
factual
matters
and
i'll
get
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question's
aspect.
first
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
mr.
kreiger
stated
initially
that
during
the
10
days,
the
boy
was
being
held
on
those
other
purse
snatching,
he
then
admitted
in
effect
that
that
was
not
so.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
will
support
the
contention
that
he
was
being
held
in
connection
with
other
purse
snatchings.
the
record
states
nothing
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
arrested
for
those,
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
he
was
taken
into
custody,
correct,
but
as
mr.
kreiger
has
stated,
new
jersey
law
would
leave
unclear
whether
he
should
be
released
under
that
situation
and
the
clear
implication
here
is
that
he
was
held
because
he
was
being
investigated
for
the
wise
and
giambra
matters.
secondly,
mr.
kreiger's
statement
that
the
boy
was
estranged
from
his
family
and
that
that
explains
to
mr.
justice
marshall
why
the
mother
wasn't
called.
the
mother
had
contacted
the
police
two
or
three
times,
the
juvenile
authorities
more
asking
that
this
boy
be
brought
home
when
he
was
picked
up
and
both
the
police
and
the
juvenile
authorities
knew
that
and
the
parents
were
not
contacted.
third,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
about
whether
he
was
told
about
the
probation
officer's
role.
mr.
kreiger
has
said
that
he
will
file
something
responsive
to
that,
i
think
the
court
will
find
at
pages
200
and
201
of
the
appendix
all
that
there
is.
it
supports
my
statement
that
he
knew
that
the
probation
officer
was
a
probation
officer,
had
been
assigned
to
“stay
with
him”
and
that's
it.
finally,
--
no,
two
more
points.
first,
mr.
kreiger's
statement
as
to
what
the
probation
officer
told
the
boy.
this
is
on
page
90
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
good
probation
officer
advice.
i
took
advantage
of
one
of
the
respects
in
questioning,
one
of
these
episodes
to
ask
the
boy
that
if
he
really
knew
anything
about
these
offenses
that
he
should
unburden
himself
and
search
his
conscience
and
that
he
would
feel
much
better
if
he
told
it
because
he
would
have
to
live
with
it
the
rest
of
his
life,
the
sort
of
counseling
i
would
give
any
boy
in
the
juvenile
court.
that's
the
support
and
assistance
of
the
probation
officer.
finally,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
black's
question.
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
you
will
not
find
in
the
record,
the
original
record
any
indication
of
a
number
of
prior
incidents
of
this
boy.
the
record
only
shows
that
he
was
a
probationer
of
the
juvenile
court
at
the
time
that
he
was
picked
up
here.
it
shows
nothing
about
the
number,
frequency,
reasons
for
his
being
in
probation.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
record.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
believe
that
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
believe
that's
correct.
now,
if
i
may
speak
very
briefly
having
only
a
minute
left
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
point.
we
think
that
the
sentencing
question
is
a
fairly
straight
forward
application
in
respect
in
patterson
with
one
wrinkle.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
this
boy's
maximum
sentence
was
determined
subsequent
to
his
original
trial
that
a
finding
was
made
which
was
neither
required
nor
in
fact
made
at
the
original
juvenile
trial,
which
was
that
he
was
adjudicated
a
delinquent
on
the
basis
of
an
offense
which
would
be
first
degree
murder.
that
involves
findings
not
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
within
the
meaning
of
speck,
a
new
fact.
under
new
jersey
law,
evidence
is
admissible
going
to
that
fact,
such
as
evidence
of
diminished
capacity,
in
this
case
psychiatric
evidence
which
was
not
put
in
by
his
counsel
as
it
should
not
have
been
at
the
original
trial
since
it
didn't
matter
what
degree
of
homicide.
he
was
found
guilty
of
as
a
juvenile
prior
to
the
new
statute.
now,
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
or
not
speck
applies
if
the
new
finding
of
fact
is
required
not
by
antecedent
legislation,
but
by
subsequent
legislation
which
state
law
chooses
to
make
retroactive.
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
makes
no
difference
whatever.
it
is
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
has
chosen
to
said
that
a
differentiation
between
two
classes
of
people
should
be
made,
those
who
have
been
found
guilty
of
first
degree
of
homicide
and
those
who
have
lesser
degrees.
the
difference
is
critical.
the
difference
in
this
case
was
the
difference
between
six
years
in
prison,
this
boy
would
have
been
released
sever
years
ago,
and
a
life
sentence,
that
fact
is
a
critical
fact
it
was
not
an
issue.
the
state
has
put
it
in
issue
by
the
new
legislation
and
we
think
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
hearing
on
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
the
juvenile
delinquency?
the
charges
were
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
not
guilty,
i
didn't
do
it,
but
that
went
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
yes,
an
alibi
that's
correct.
however
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
i
disagree
with
the
state
entirely
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
diminished
capacity
because
you
don't
have
to
admit
anything
to
show
the
juvenile
judge
or
your
jury
what
the
nature
of
the
defendant
is.
it's
not
like
the
defense
of
consent
in
a
rape
case
which
isn't
consistent
with
alibi.
to
simply
show
the
court
that
they're
dealing
with
a
juvenile
who
may
be
defective,
retarded.
remember,
the
court
here
ordered
psychiatric
treatment
for
this
boy
when
it
originally
committed
him,
simply
tells
the
court
that
if
he
did
do
it
which
he
says
he
didn't
do
that
he
hasn't
got
the
capacity
to
be
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
no
inconsistency
there,
any
good
trial
there
could
present
those
two
facts.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
in
the
initial
proceeding
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
must
admit
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
perhaps
mr.
kreiger
could
enlighten
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
no
issue
has
been
made
of
this
below
and
--
mr.
anthony
g.
armsterdam
i
have
--
all
i
can
say
is
to
that
i'll
be
glad
to
find
it
out
and
submit
unless
mr.
kreiger
knows
the
answer
to
that
question,
submit
it
to
