court,
the
state

the

proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
langston
but
we'll
wait
until
you
have
your
papers
all
assembled.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
sometimes
it's
been
separated
from
the
mainland
and
sometimes
the
sandbar
builds
up
and
it's
connected,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
anywhere
the
likely
or
probable
tax
that
either
of
the
states
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there's
somebody
--
if
somebody
has
been
paying
taxes
on
it
to
some
state
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
our
people,
i'm
not
sure
just
what
you
mean.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
people
without
there
weren't
arkansas
citizens,
maybe
if
they
--
do
they
live
on
--
are
there
any
--
was
there
residence
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can't
get
that
out
of
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
their
theory,
it
could
never
change,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
even
if
the
river
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
does
this
record
show
at
what
depth
in
that
part
of
it,
the
water
would
cease
to
be
moving
water
and
becomes
stagnant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
should
think
that
would
consider
the
difference
as
they
said
three
feet
plus
was
the
minimum,
the
evidence
says
that
this
crucial
point
there
was
one
foot
of
water
which
as
justice
white
suggested
doesn't
sound
like
much
of
a
channel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
evidence
show
that
it
could
do
that
at
a
one
foot
depth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
whole
process
comes
from
the
water
carrying
silt
in
suspension,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
the
record
does
not
show
any
expert
testimony
whether
it
will
carry
it
and
the
substantial
silt
at
a
one
foot
channel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
--
i
could
not
get
very
clearly
in
mind
the
significance
of
access
for
court
facilities,
docs,
words?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
--
then
you
did
not
necessarily
mean
the
state's
access
but
the
private
owner's
access,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
only
access
the
state
would
have
if
it's
privately
owned
would
be
by
right
of
eminent
domain,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
indicated
that
people
have
been
farming
this
over
the
period
of
years
on
that
private
owners
cert
of
title,
at
least
i
so
understood
you.
chief

warren
e.

very
well,
thank
you.
mr.

chief

will
you

little

still
leave

of
course
but
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
just
for
a
moment,
can
you
see?
chief

warren
e.
burger
now,
will
you
get
us
oriented
with
the

is
north

the

position
here?
chief

e.

it
doesn't

does
it?
chief

would
you

the

chief

before

chief

to

you
now
addressing

where
do
you
say
that

between
these
two

chief

warren
e.
burger
the

chief

warren
e.
burger
it
would
help
me
with
the
topic
counsel
if
could
see
comparison
again
that
the
one
you
showed
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
flash,
you
just
turn
it
up
for
a
moment
so
we
can
make
comparison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
the
river?
chief

warren
e.
burger
which
–
taking
the
island
which
is
on
the
former

the
last
to
previous
exhibit,
identify
that
on
the
second
one
for
me
at
least
that
would
help.
chief

warren
e.
burger
as
you're
active
in
what
sense,
active
in
the
sense
--
object
you
have
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
used
for

or
just
capable

chief

warren
e.
burger
but
now
when
you
have
that
overlay
where
is
the
main
channel
of
the
river?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
boats
used
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
approximately
what's
the
width
of
that
channel,
it's
of
course,
it
looks
very
narrow
on
this
map.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
it
is
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
main
river,
yes.
the
main
river
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah
and
what
is
the
distance
across
the
center?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
to
take
the
center
of
your
map,
i'm
trying
to
get
the
relationship.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much
of
the
area
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
how
much
does
he
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
you
might
be
back
here
in
30
to
40
years
down.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
pause
now
for
lunch
counsel.
you
may
proceed
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
got
about
eight
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
in
your
reply
brief
or
your
main
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
appendix
a
3?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hope
you
haven't
given
your
case
the
way
with
that
answer
to
justice
black,
your
position
must
be
that
mule
was
in
tennessee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
a
mile
away
from
tennessee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
is
up
counsel
except
you
may
have.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there's
a
question
pending
you
can
respond
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
will
treat
them
as
visual
aids
to
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
consider
them
to
the
extent
they're
consistent
with
matters
and
evidence.
mr.
langston.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
out
of
5,000?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
it's
not
uncommon
on
land
boundaries
for
the
farmers
to
have
the
farm
–they
have
got
couple
of
hundred
acres
in
one
state
and
spill
over
into
the
next
state.
nothing
unique
about
that
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
langston
i
was
about
to
ask
you
a
question
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case
but
perhaps
you
could
answer
if
you
know.
is
there
any
jurisdictional
constitutional
reason
why
your
states,
state
of
arkansas
could
not
agree
with
another
state,
state
of
tennessee
for
example,
by
legislative
action
to
submit
this
kind
of
dispute
to
a
joint
commission
established
by
the
two
states,
would
you
be
legally
permitted
to
do
or
maybe
a
large
legal
question
that
if
you
know
i'm
interested
in
your
answer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
mean
in
courts,
i
mean
the
joint
commissions
established
by
two
--
the
legislatures
of
two
contending
states
with
an
agreement
just
submitted
to
final
and
binding
arbitration
instead
of
bringing
it
under
the
constitutional
provisions
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
has
been
done
on
the
--
by
state
water
commission
but
that's
in
new
york,
new
jersey
but
that
perhaps
have
little
different
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
some
interest
to
us,
you
might
be
able
to
do
it
less
expensively
elsewhere
than
here.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
submission
mr.
langston,
thank
you
mr.
sutton.
the

is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
langston
i
was
about
to
ask
you
a
question
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case
but
perhaps
you
could
answer
if
you
know.
is
there
any
jurisdictional
constitutional
reason
why
your
states,
state
of
arkansas
could
not
agree
with
another
state,
state
of
tennessee
for
example,
by
legislative
action
to
submit
this
kind
of
dispute
to
a
joint
commission
established
by
the
two
states,
would
you
be
legally
permitted
to
do
or
maybe
a
large
legal
question
that
if
you
know
i'm
interested
in
your
answer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn't
mean
in
courts,
i
mean
the
joint
commissions
established
by
two
--
the
legislatures
of
two
contending
states
with
an
agreement
just
submitted
to
final
and
binding
arbitration
instead
of
bringing
it
under
the
constitutional
provisions
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
has
been
done
on
the
--
by
state
water
commission
but
that's
in
new
york,
new
jersey
but
that
perhaps
have
little
different
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
some
interest
to
us,
you
might
be
able
to
do
it
less
expensively
elsewhere
than
here.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
submission
mr.
langston,
thank
you
mr.
sutton.
the
case
is
submitted.
