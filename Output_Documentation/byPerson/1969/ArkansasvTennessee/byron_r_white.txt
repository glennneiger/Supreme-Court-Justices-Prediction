justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
the
avulsion
there
was
a
new
channel,
different
location.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
the
main
channel
of
the
river,
and
the
old
channel
was
still
--
had
some
water
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
one
of
the
--
when
that
new
channel
was
activated
and
the
old
one
became
stagnant,
as
soon
as
it
became
stagnant,
you
should
consider
that
it
was
a
dead
thalweg.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
that
should
stabilize
the
boundary
at
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
special
master
found
that
it
didn't
although
the
new
soil
bed
was
active,
the
new
channel
active.
there
was
also
he
thought
an
old
channel
that
was
active
and
still
effective
to
changes
the
boundary
of
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
high
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
long
as
the
old
channel
is
all
dead
and
had
some
water
in
it,
high
water,
that
water
could
–-
if
it
washed
away
into
the
shore
of
arkansas
the
boundary
of
the
state
could
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what's
you're
saying
is
that
as
soon
as
the
water
stagnates,
then
you
could
really
do
know
there's
been
an
avulsion,
that
there
is
a
new
channel
active.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
your
evidence
did
show
what
your
claim
was,
--
namely
that
at
certain
time
that
the
old
channel
was
dead
and
at
that
moment,
the
boundary
line
was
fixed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
master
i
take
it
thought
that
that
old
channel
didn't
really
die
until
what,
1950
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
until
after
1955,
although
from
1915
or
16
or
17,
some
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
from
back
from
1916,
the
main
channel
has
been
used
for
navigation
and
what
not
has
been
the
new
channel.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
that
map,
is
it
attached
to
it
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
exceptions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
have
determine
that
one
way
or
the
other
either
at
low
water
or
high
water
and
he
had
to
pick
the
time
at
which
that
boundary
line
became
fixed,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
dispute
that
there
were
stagnation
at
low
water
long
before
the
time
that
the
master
pick?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
testimony
then
that
the
master
based
his
report
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
roger
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
master
would
let
it
move
if
it
was
only
flood
water?
if
it's
a
flood
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
just
routine
retain
high
water
and
flood
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
any
doubt
in
the
evidence,
in
roger's
evidence
that
--
or
any
other
evidence
that
stagnation
at
low
water
occurred
long
before
1955?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
when
he
says,
he
saw
a
foot
of
water
there
as
late
as
--
after
1955,
foot
of
water,
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
at
high
water,
what
about
at
low
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
a
foot
of
water
or
high
water
is
much
of
a
channel
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
affected
it
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
the
master
could
be
right
on
the
first
point
and
you
could
still
win
on
the
second
point.
if
you
have
got
a
sound
legal
position
that
you
were
entitled
to
maintain
your
same
river
frontage
that
you
had
at
the
moment
the
avulsion
occurred
and
that
future
accretions
to
(inaudible)
that's
fragmented
of
(inaudible)
those
accretions
downstream,
can't
belong
tennessee
because
they
must
belong
to
arkansas
so
the
arkansas
can
maintain
this
river
frontage.
is
that
independent
for
you?
i
thought
it
was
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
speak
with
the
microphone
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
the
distance
traveled
may
not
be
the
center?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
rank
has
been
very
well
kept
like
that
because
of
the
arkansas.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
better
go
ahead
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sorry,
i
beg
your
attention,
what
is
the
overlay?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
statement
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he's
really
saying
if
the
erosion
and
accretion
occur
lays
that
high
water
or
at
extra
ordinary
high
water,
he
is
saying
that
as
long
as
that
could
happen,
the
boundary
could
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
whether
it's
an
high
water
or
low
water
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
this
channel
like
that
lake
channel,
that
old
with
the
old
channel
that
north
and
west
they
weren't
--
i
suppose
to
be
absolutely
dry
six
months
of
the
year
or
nine
months
of
the
year
and
that
at
very
high
water,
there
could
be
water
running
through
which
would
erode
the
banks.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
the
master's
rule,
the
state
line
would
change
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
no
longer
an
active
channel
or
for
navigation
or
for
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
but
just
a
little
sort
of
a
--
it's
not
really
the
arm
--
it's
just
the
sort
of
inactive
arm
with
the
mississippi
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
that
inactive
arm
is
sufficient
to
--
is
still
effective
to
change
the
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
there
was
a
lot
of
--
and
certainly
there
was
a
large
flood
and
water
went
through
that
channel,
it
would
and
it
eroded,
the
boundary
would
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
if
there
are
these
various
stages
of
the
river
which
i
take
it
everyone
agrees,
there
are
that
channel
could
be
stagnant
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
erosion
or
accretion
at
the
lowest
stages
of
the
river.
and
yet
at
other
times
of
the
year
at
higher
water,
there
would
be
a
lot
more
water
falling
through
that
old
channel
and
it
would
might
that
it
knows
on
those
occasions
erode.
and
the
master
would
say
“as
long
as
that
is
so
there
will
be
boundary
changes.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
channel
was
closed
to
navigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
physically
closed?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
do
you
think
stagnation
occurred
and
erosion
stopped?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
got
to
look
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
in
1929,
the
river
was
stagnant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
old
channel
was
stagnant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
from
1912.
justice
byron
r.
white
1929.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
take
on
the
lower
part
of
the
map
there.
now
the
state
line
is
that
dark
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
agrees
that
was
1912?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
since
that
time
until
1929
or
even
until
the
day
that
that
line
has
moved
no
farther
west,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
still
agree
that
in
the
lower
part
of
that
channel,
it
was
still
active
and
not
to
be
considered
an
active
channel
for
purpose
of
moving
the
state
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
mean
this
red
line
and
that's
quite
below,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
below
the
intersection
or
the
avulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
to
the
west
end
of
the
island
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
i
know
right
that
--
the
state
line
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
agree
then
that
that
channel
--
if
the
lower
part
of
it,
would
you
agree
that
the
lower
part
of
the
channel,
when
do
you
say
that
the
channel
became
stagnant
in
the
area
running
by
the
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
1916
to
1925.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
lower
part
of
the
channel
became
stagnant,
how
could
the
upper
part
of
the
channel
has
been
active?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
sutton,
was
the
cross
examination
of
mr.
smith
based
on
what
you
just
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
conceded
that
he
had
not
referred
to
the
maps.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
know
much
difference
it
would
make
in
this
case
but
if
the
master
were
wrong
about
saying
that
as
long
as
there
is
accretion
or
erosion
at
any
stage
of
the
river
through
the
old
channel.
that's
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
as
long
as
there
are
erosion
or
accretion
in
that
old
channel,
the
boundary
changes.
if
he
is
wrong
in
that,
it
may
not
make
much
difference
in
this
case
but
if
he's
wrong
in
that,
well
that's
perhaps
is
the
issue,
one
of
the
issues
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
asked
you
awhile
ago
if
that
statement
would
cover
a
situation
where
erosion
and
accretion
take
place
at
some
times
of
the
year
but
not
others.
it
takes
place
at
high
water
or
at
ordinary
high
water,
it
takes
by
80
feet
to
take
place,
but
at
the
ordinary
low
water
it
doesn't.
i
would
suppose
that
the
statement
of
the
master
would
include
that
kind
of
erosion.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
erosion
occurs
when
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
old
channel
suddenly
became
part
of
the
new
channel.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
part
of
the
bid.
so
in
19
--
that's
25
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
the
state
line
between
arkansas
and
tennessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
river
had
come
back
and
joined
with
the
old
abandoned
channel
to
some
extent,
the
state
line
still
remained
in
the
old
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
gather
that
tennessee
concedes
that
the
old
channel
died
some
years
ago
and
it
is
now
dead,
the
boundary
won't
change
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
up
to
the
north
and
west
relief
into
that
territory
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
even
if
you
have
some
difference
about
what
to
test
or
to
be
when
the
old
channel
dies
if
you
both
agree
that
that
state
line
in
1912
was
where
that
maps
showed
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1912?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
state
line
is
where
he
says
that
was
in
1912
to
the
north
and
the
west,
cow
island
or
that
segment
of
cow
island,
the
state
line
is
where
he
said
it
was
all
the
accretions
and
where
on
the
tennessee
side
of
that
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well
that's
your
second
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
your
first
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
the
first
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you're
right
on
that,
what's
the
consequence
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
wouldn't
be
anymore
movement
in
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
didn't
know
that
he
indicates
that
the
west
and
the
north
of
that
island
that
he
doesn't
claim
that
the
state
line
changed
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
the
avulsion
there
was
a
new
channel,
different
location.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
the
main
channel
of
the
river,
and
the
old
channel
was
still
--
had
some
water
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
one
of
the
--
when
that
new
channel
was
activated
and
the
old
one
became
stagnant,
as
soon
as
it
became
stagnant,
you
should
consider
that
it
was
a
dead
thalweg.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
that
should
stabilize
the
boundary
at
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
special
master
found
that
it
didn't
although
the
new
soil
bed
was
active,
the
new
channel
active.
there
was
also
he
thought
an
old
channel
that
was
active
and
still
effective
to
changes
the
boundary
of
the
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
high
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
long
as
the
old
channel
is
all
dead
and
had
some
water
in
it,
high
water,
that
water
could
–-
if
it
washed
away
into
the
shore
of
arkansas
the
boundary
of
the

could
change.
justice

and
you
could
still
win
on
the
second
point.
if
you
have
got
a
sound
legal
position
that
you
were
entitled
to
maintain
your
same
river
frontage
that
you
had
at
the
moment
the
avulsion
occurred
and
that
future
accretions
to
(inaudible)
that's
fragmented
of
(inaudible)
those
accretions
downstream,
can't
belong
tennessee
because
they
must
belong
to
arkansas
so
the
arkansas
can
maintain
this
river
frontage.
is
that
independent
for
you?
i
thought
it
was
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
speak
with
the
microphone
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
the
distance
traveled
may
not
be
the
center?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
rank
has
been
very
well
kept
like
that
because
of
the
arkansas.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
better
go
ahead
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sorry,
i
beg
your
attention,
what
is
the
overlay?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
statement
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he's
really
saying
if
the
erosion
and
accretion
occur
lays
that
high
water
or
at
extra
ordinary
high
water,
he
is
saying
that
as
long
as
that
could
happen,
the
boundary
could
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
whether
it's
an
high
water
or
low
water
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
this
channel
like
that
lake
channel,
that
old
with
the
old
channel
that
north
and
west
they
weren't
--
i
suppose
to
be
absolutely
dry
six
months
of
the
year
or
nine
months
of
the
year
and
that
at
very
high
water,
there
could
be
water
running
through
which
would
erode
the
banks.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
the
master's
rule,
the
state
line
would
change
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
no
longer
an
active
channel
or
for
navigation
or
for
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
but
just
a
little
sort
of
a
--
it's
not
really
the
arm
--
it's
just
the
sort
of
inactive
arm
with
the
mississippi
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
that
inactive
arm
is
sufficient
to
--
is
still
effective
to
change
the
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
there
was
a
lot
of
--
and
certainly
there
was
a
large
flood
and
water
went
through
that
channel,
it
would
and
it
eroded,
the
boundary
would
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
if
there
are
these
various
stages
of
the
river
which
i
take
it
everyone
agrees,
there
are
that
channel
could
be
stagnant
in
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
erosion
or
accretion
at
the
lowest
stages
of
the
river.
and
yet
at
other
times
of
the
year
at
higher
water,
there
would
be
a
lot
more
water
falling
through
that
old
channel
and
it
would
might
that
it
knows
on
those
occasions
erode.
and
the
master
would
say
“as
long
as
that
is
so
there
will
be
boundary
changes.”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
channel
was
closed
to
navigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
physically
closed?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
do
you
think
stagnation
occurred
and
erosion
stopped?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
got
to
look
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
in
1929,
the
river
was
stagnant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
old
channel
was
stagnant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
from
1912.
justice
byron
r.
white
1929.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
take
on
the
lower
part
of
the
map
there.
now
the
state
line
is
that
dark
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
agrees
that
was
1912?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
since
that
time
until
1929
or
even
until
the
day
that
that
line
has
moved
no
farther
west,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
still
agree
that
in
the
lower
part
of
that
channel,
it
was
still
active
and
not
to
be
considered
an
active
channel
for
purpose
of
moving
the
state
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
mean
this
red
line
and
that's
quite
below,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
below
the
intersection
or
the
avulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
to
the
west
end
of
the
island
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
i
know
right
that
--
the
state
line
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
agree
then
that
that
channel
--
if
the
lower
part
of
it,
would
you
agree
that
the
lower
part
of
the
channel,
when
do
you
say
that
the
channel
became
stagnant
in
the
area
running
by
the
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
1916
to
1925.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
lower
part
of
the
channel
became
stagnant,
how
could
the
upper
part
of
the
channel
has
been
active?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
sutton,
was
the
cross
examination
of
mr.
smith
based
on
what
you
just
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
conceded
that
he
had
not
referred
to
the
maps.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
know
much
difference
it
would
make
in
this
case
but
if
the
master
were
wrong
about
saying
that
as
long
as
there
is
accretion
or
erosion
at
any
stage
of
the
river
through
the
old
channel.
that's
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
as
long
as
there
are
erosion
or
accretion
in
that
old
channel,
the
boundary
changes.
if
he
is
wrong
in
that,
it
may
not
make
much
difference
in
this
case
but
if
he's
wrong
in
that,
well
that's
perhaps
is
the
issue,
one
of
the
issues
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
asked
you
awhile
ago
if
that
statement
would
cover
a
situation
where
erosion
and
accretion
take
place
at
some
times
of
the
year
but
not
others.
it
takes
place
at
high
water
or
at
ordinary
high
water,
it
takes
by
80
feet
to
take
place,
but
at
the
ordinary
low
water
it
doesn't.
i
would
suppose
that
the
statement
of
the
master
would
include
that
kind
of
erosion.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
erosion
occurs
when
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
old
channel
suddenly
became
part
of
the
new
channel.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
part
of
the
bid.
so
in
19
--
that's
25
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
the
state
line
between
arkansas
and
tennessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
river
had
come
back
and
joined
with
the
old
abandoned
channel
to
some
extent,
the
state
line
still
remained
in
the
old
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
gather
that
tennessee
concedes
that
the
old
channel
died
some
years
ago
and
it
is
now
dead,
the
boundary
won't
change
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
up
to
the
north
and
west
relief
into
that
territory
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
even
if
you
have
some
difference
about
what
to
test
or
to
be
when
the
old
channel
dies
if
you
both
agree
that
that
state
line
in
1912
was
where
that
maps
showed
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1912?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
state
line
is
where
he
says
that
was
in
1912
to
the
north
and
the
west,
cow
island
or
that
segment
of
cow
island,
the
state
line
is
where
he
said
it
was
all
the
accretions
and
where
on
the
tennessee
side
of
that
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well
that's
your
second
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
your
first
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
the
first
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you're
right
on
that,
what's
the
consequence
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
wouldn't
be
anymore
movement
in
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
didn't
know
that
he
indicates
that
the
west
and
the
north
of
that
island
that
he
doesn't
claim
that
the
state
line
changed
any
--
