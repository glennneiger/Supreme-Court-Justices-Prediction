mr.
heard
h.
sutton
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justice,
the
state
of
tennessee
urges
that
you
overrule
the
exceptions
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
you
approve
and
confirm
the
report
of
the
master
and
in
a
decree
in
this
court
as
he
recommends.
the
case
that
we
have
before
you
involves
the
mighty
mississippi
river
and
you
are
going
to
now,
i
believe
change
your
positions
and
become
engineers
and
judicial
engineers
are
the
final
say
and
we
hope
to
present
to
you
now
and
picture
so
that
you
can
determine
that
position.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
now,
your
honor
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
can
you
see
mr.
justice?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
these
drawings
are
in
the
exhibits.
we
simply
made
copies
of
them
because
they
will
present
to
you
in
the
sort
of
a
pictorial
way
what
we
would
like
to
tell
you
this
afternoon.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
ordinarily
the
top
of
the
map
is
north
and
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
will
be
so
on
all
of
these
drawings
and
there
are
only
about
three
drawings
where
that
rule
is
not
used.
in
other
words
most
all
of
the
maps
that
you
see
in
this
case,
the
top
is
north.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
this
case
began
of
the
history
of
it
when
arkansas
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1836.
at
that
time,
the
united
states
government
made
a
survey
of
the
arkansas
land
as
it
came
up
to
the
river
bank
and
this
would
be
the
line
of
arkansas
in
1836.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
blue
is
the
water,
the
white
is
arkansas
and
this
pink
color
is
the
tennessee
lands
on
which
titles
were
traced
to
these
accretions.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
not
in
the
brief
but
there
is
a
report
by
mr.
rogers,
it's
tennessee's
exhibit
10
and
in
that
report
he
places
these
maps
in
a
reduced
form
so
that
you
have
the
complete
set
up
in
there.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
in
original
record.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir.
now
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
kind
to
take
these
by
steps.
in
1825
the
state
of
tennessee
was
also
surveyed
by
the
general
land
office
of
the
united
states
and
that
is
the
land
that
they
established.
so
that
by
those
two
original
land
surveys
in
that
period
of
time,
you
can
get
the
general
position
of
the
mississippi
river
at
the
time
arkansas
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now,
both
states
agree
that
at
this
time
that
the
state
line
between
arkansas
and
tennessee
was
in
what
is
known
as
the
thalweg
or
the
valley
way,
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
where
the
boat
run
as
it
goes
downstream.
now
you
have
the
next
one
we
have
here
was
the
survey
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
in
the
year
1877.
at
that
time
the
white
again
is
arkansas,
the
blue
is
the
mississippi
river
and
the
orange
color
is
the
added
lands
known
as
accretions,
now
what
this
court
has
described
the
addition
as
accretions.
now,
may
we
stop
a
moment
and
explain
about
the
erosion
and
accretion
that
is
occurring
at
this
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
the
orange
colored
area
is
the
land
added
by
accretions
to
the
original
tennessee
lands
holding
because
the
rivers
moving
this
way.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
none
at
this
time.
it
will
show
up
later,
yes
sir
and
it
will
be
colored
orange
so
that
you
will
be
able
to
distinguish
it.
what
i
wanted
to
explain
is
that
the
mississippi
river
originally
in
ancient
times
flowed
straight
south
upon
the
great
lakes
to
the
gulf,
as
it
did
certain
things
occurred
in
the
bed
of
the
river
you
would
have
a
rise,
you
would
have
hard
place
so
you
would
have
a
low
over
something
that
would
impede
that
flow
and
that
would
force
the
water
either
to
one
side
of
the
other
and
as
it
did
it
would
scar
the
bank.
and
as
it
scar
the
bank
then
of
course
the
water
would
move
along
with
it
and
as
time
progressed
it
would
develop
what
is
known
as
a
bin
in
the
river
and
around
this
bin,
the
best
way
to
understand
this
it
is
more
like
the
river
with
wheel.
this
is
the
rim
of
the
wheel
and
this
is
the
hook.
the
water
flowing
around
the
river
with
wheel
is
moving
faster
than
the
water
around
the
hook
and
the
movement
of
the
erosion
and
the
accretions
that
upon
by
the
movement
of
that
swift
water
occurs
around
this
out
of
rim
and
that
is
where
the
fast
water
cuts
the
bank
and
chase
the
water
in
suspension
downstream
until
it
is
slow
and
that
is
why
accretions
from
on
the
inner
side
because
the
water
is
flowing
slow.
so
let
us
proceed
this
was
a
survey
by
the
united
states
engineers
at
that
time
they
were
known
as
the
mississippi
river
commission
and
it's
a
survey
so
that
we
know
that
in
1877,
this
is
the
way
the
river
in
this
area
look.
the
next
time
we
were
able
to
find
a
survey
or
map
was
in
the
year
1904.
in
1877
to
1904,
here
again
we
show
the
original
tennessee
land
and
now
the
additional
forming
of
the
accretions
to
the
tennessee
shore
and
the
mississippi
river
is
again
cutting
further
into
the
state
of
arkansas
and
washing
away
its
lands.
now,
i
have
drawn
a
red
line
here
to
indicate
where
this
arkansas
shore
was
in
1877,
so
you
can
see
how
far
between
those
two
years
the
mississippi
river
actually
eroded
as
the
world
we
use
into
arkansas.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
is
still
in
the
thalweg.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
of
the
channel
of
the
river
as
it
goes
around
that
beam.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
may
not
be
the
center
but
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
--
it
was
a
case
from
this
court
that
it
remains
in
the
thalweg
which
is
generally
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
not
always
but
it's
where
the
boats
go.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
according
to
measurements
now
on
these
maps
in
1904
and
the
later
one
1912,
the
engineers
actually
measured
the
depth
of
the
water
that's
colored
blue
here
and
by
examining
those
maps
carefully
you
can
see
how
deep
the
water
is
and
those
measurements
mostly
in
most
cases
would
be
like
one
foot
here,
two
feet,
five
feet,
ten
feet,
thirty
feet,
fifty
feet
and
within
ten
feet
of
the
bank
it
would
be
30
feet
deep
on
the
out
of
rim
of
the
wheel.
in
other
words,
the
water
there
is
just
what
they
call
a
bluff
bank,
it
would
be
very
sharply
dropped
right
down
to
a
very
deep
depth
and
the
boats
actually
run
in
close
to
the
shore
as
they
go
around
this
band.
the
next
year
and
this
is
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
is
the
year
1912,
1915.
that
was
a
survey
again
by
the
united
states
engineers
in
which
they
surveyed
this
whole
area
and
this
is
the
drawing
that
matches
exactly
the
map
made
by
the
united
states
engineers.
in
this
case
you
will
see
that
the
river
has
moved
considerably
at
again
in
arkansas
and
that
there
is
the
beginning
of
the
avulsion
that
we
speak
up
that
occurred
in
1930.
now,
according
to
this
question
about
the
river
stagnating
at
low
water
or
high
water
which
will
get
to
in
a
few
minutes.
at
this
time
the
river
was
at
11
feet
and
at
11
feet
this
depth
through
here
was
on
seven
or
eight
feet
so
that
if
we
follow
this
low
water
or
zero
water,
then
at
that
time
we
had
no
channel
through
here
we
had
no
avulsion
because
at
zero
water
this
was
all
dry
land
from
right
here
to
right
here.
now,
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
won't
explain
that
in
detail
later
--
i
might
as
well
do
it
now.
the
engineers
designate
the
elevation
of
the
land
including
the
river
by
feet
or
numbers.
for
instance,
it
is
279
feet
on
this
shore
from
sea
level
at
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
other
words
the
land
rises
a
total
of
279
feet.
all
right,
at
these
locations
for
the
sake
of
navigation
they
tell
the
pilots
of
the
boats,
how
deep
the
river
is.
they
have
established
an
arbitrary
zero
as
they
call
it
at
some
200
and
say
60
feet
above
the
gulf
level.
and
that
zero,
that's
the
lowest
point
to
which
the
river
will
ordinarily
go
doing
its
ups
and
downs
doing
the
sea
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
low
water
is
3.2
feet
above
zero.
now,
the
point
is
that
that's
an
arbitrary
figure
for
the
purpose
of
these
men
on
the
river
to
know
whether
the
river
is
shallow
or
whether
it
has
got
a
lot
of
water
because
as
it
gets
shallow,
every
time
they
come
into
a
crossing
in
the
river,
it
will
be
five
or
six
feet
deep
or
maybe
eight
feet
deep
and
they
have
got
to
be
very
careful
in
getting
across
or
they
are
on
the
ground.
the
water
round
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
matthews.
now,
that
is
established
at
that
place
you
can
go
all
up
and
down
the
river
and
they
will
have
different
heights
and
gages
like
the
gage
at
helena
arkansas
is
different
from
the
one
at
cairo,
illinois
is
different
but
only
14
or
15
miles
from
this
point
is
a
gage
at
memphis
that
they
have
established
for
that
area.
the
3.2
feet
is
what
they
call
ordinary
low
water,
that's
when
the
water
sinks
to
in
the
dry
season.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
will
only
give
you
a
comparison.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right,
you
will
know.
now,
to
understand
this
low
and
high
water,
the
point
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
confused
here
is
they
speak
of
high
water
and
they
do
not
distinguish
between
ordinary
high
water
and
high
water.
ordinary
high
water
that
was
spoken
of
by
mr.
rogers
is
18
feet
on
this
memphis
gauge,
that
is
know
is
mid
bank
stages.
there
the
river
is
just
up
good
above
this
low
stage.
the
high
water
or
flood
water
is
around
40
feet
on
the
memphis
gauge.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
flood
waters
as
we
speak
of
are
when
they
get
above
that
figure.
in
other
words
the,
40
feet
would
be
the
measurement
at
the
top
of
the
bank
and
above
that
the
water
will
flow
over
into
the
low
lands.
now,
it's
still
confined
within
the
lewis
until
it
gets
above
50
and
55
feet
but
it
is
over
its
own
banks
at
40
feet.
now,
to
this
point
in
time,
this
is
1912
and
1950
the
state
of
arkansas
has
conceded
and
agreed
with
tennessee
that
these
accretions
moved
over
into
this
position
and
that
the
arkansas
shore
was
eroded
to
that
position,
that
the
approximate
state
line
is
shown
by
this
black
line.
now,
they
have
a
map
that
they
have
in
here
which
they
have
placed
the
state
line
on
it
and
we
have
one
where
we
placed
the
state
line
but
for
most
cases
in
accord,
there
might
be
some
variation
a
little
bit
about
where
there
was
--
the
depth
was
shown
in
two
places
and
one
will
take
one
side
one
on
the
other.
but
this
would
be
the
state
line
in
1912
as
the
--
just
before
the
avulsion
occurred.
now,
your
honors
when
this
case
first
began
in
1968,
the
state
of
arkansas
said
there
was
no
avulsion.
that's
what
they
plead
in
the
case.
there
was
no
avulsion.
they
said
that
the
river
migrated
and
migration
is
by
erosion
and
accretion.
the
road
on
one
side
and
accretions
formed
on
the
other.
they
said
that
the
river
migrated
up
to
this
position
in
1912.
then
they
say
that
it
reversed
itself
and
migrated
back
down
so
that
today,
where
it
has
migrated
is
the
same
river
we
had
here
and
there
was
no
avulsion,
and
that's
the
state
when
of
their
expert
witness,
when
they
plead.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
i
was
going
down,
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
is
as
it
is
today.
now,
we
have
attached
here
to
a
copy
of
the
aerial
photograph
which
is
the
exhibit.
there
was
a
picture
from
an
airplane
mean
all
this
land
and
we
took
that
picture
laid
it
over
here
so
that
you
could
see
just
how
they
compare.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
river
is
at
this
point.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
this
area.
now,
i
have
one
of
these
maps
set
here
but
it's
not
the
total
to
show
the
comparison
but
the
reason
we
want
to
do
that
was
for
this
area
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
your
honor,
we
will
go
through
from
begin
and
the
end.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
over
lay
is
also
a
copy
of
the
aerial
photograph
of
1965.
in
the
few
minutes
i'll
explain
why
it's
here.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
that
when
they
first
began
this
case
the
state
of
arkansas
said
there
was
no
avulsion
that
the
river
migrated
up
to
the
position
it
is
here,
then
it
migrated
back
down,
that
is
by
erosion
and
accretion
and
that
no
avulsion
ever
occurred
and
that
the
river
did
not
stagnate
and
this
is
by
mr.
smith,
their
own
witness
says,
“no,
it
didn't
stagnate
it
moves
out
and
it
moved
back.”
until
they
got
in
to
the
trial
of
the
case
before
the
master
and
either
i
think
it
was
the
second
day
that
they
were
there.
they
change
their
position
and
they
said,
“yes,
we
admit
now
that
it
did
there
was
avulsion,
that
this
channel
did
fall
and
that
the
river
did
not
migrate
back
out
as
we
claim.”
see,
they
first
said
that
it
migrated
up
this
way
and
then
came
back
east
to
where
it
is
today.
in
the
middle
of
appearing
before
the
master,
they
admitted
that
this
avulsion
occurred
and
said
that
the
river
instead
of
migrating
back
to
where
it
is
today
migrated
on
further
westward.
they
positioned
by
like
that
where
it
stagnated
at
low
water
and
that's
the
argument
of
arkansas
but
on
that
point
there
are
witness
on
whom
they're
relying
made
this
statement
that
is
in
the
record,
that
the
stage
of
the
river
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
stagnation.
that's
his
own
testimony
in
this
case.
he
says
that
whether
the
river
is
at
low
water
or
high
water
or
whatever
stage
it
is,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
stagnation.
mr.
roger
says
that
it
is
possible
for
the
river
to
be
moved
by
erosion
and
accretions
when
it
gets
up
to
about
ordinary
high
water
because
that's
the
line
he
says
where
the
vegetation
ceases,
says
it
possible.
now,
he
didn't
say
that
that's
when
it
stagnates
nor
did
the
master
say
that's
when
it
stagnates.
the
master's
statements
to
me
is
one
that
this
court
could
follow
with
and
never
have
to
worry
about
to
be
an
outline.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
on
page
seven
of
the
master's
report
in
the
second
paragraph.
let
see
it's
line
20
--
beginning
at
line
23,
that
would
be
about
2/3
of
the
way
down
and
the
master
says
this,
“and
when
the
water
becomes
stagnant
and
erosion
and
accretion
no
longer
occur,
the
boundary
becomes
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
old
channel.”
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
says
that
if
erosion
and
accretion
occur.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right,
you
say
that
just
like
mr.
smith
said
it
is
not
the
stage
of
the
river
that
causes
this.
if
the
riverbed
moves
then
you
have
and
it
move
by
erosion
and
accretion,
then
it
is
not
stagnated
but
when
the
bed
does
not
move
which
is
the
same
thing
that
the
master
has
said
as
long
as
erosion
and
accretion
doesn't
occur.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
that
would
depend
on
--
merely
to
think
it
is
possible,
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
low
is
that.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
if
it
erodes,
this
court
has
said
itself
that
so
long
as
the
old
channel
can
be
moved
by
erosion
and
accretion.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
the
point
your
honor,
if
there
is
enough
water
in
there
to
cause
it
to
erode,
it
is
an
active
channel.
it
could
not
be
otherwise.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
now
your
honor,
like
the
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
it
has
not
moved
since
1929.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
had
been
two
very
high
and
extremely
bad
floods.
the
one
of
1937
is
the
one
that
caused
congress
to
reenact
the
flood
control
bill
and
that
case
of
1937
and
1947
neither
of
which
had
any
effect
on
this
situation
here.
it
is
not
the
fact,
the
height
of
the
water.
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
again
becomes
an
active
channel.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
you
have
erosion
and
accretion
there.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
your
honor
let
me
answer
that
in
this
fashion.
in
1932
a
river
board,
a
125
feet
long
and
15
feet
wide
went
through
this
channel
here
but
only
doing
the
stage
of
the
river
when
the
water
was
above
20
feet
is
what
the
man
said
it
was
about
20
feet,
a
little
above
mid
stage.
he
went
through
down
a
boat
because
he
went
through
for
a
purpose,
but
the
river
boats
would
not
have
gone
through
there
at
all
because
even
though
water
was
flowing
in
there
at
that
time,
it
was
not
an
active
channel,
and
there
was
no
way
for
the
regular
boats
to
go
in
there.
you
see,
if
it's
an
active
channel,
it
will
scar
out
its
bed
and
move
its
bed
some
--
if
it
moves
its
bed,
and
that
is
the
only
time
that
it
would
affect
a
state
line
as
when
it
becomes
active.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir
your
honor,
let
me
explain
there
and
let's
take
this
particular
situation
as
an
example.
in
1929,
this
channel
had
already
closed.
now,
there
is
a
peculiar
phenomenon
that
goes
on
when
a
channel
is
abandoned
and
this
you
will
find
in
the
reports
of
both
mr.
smith
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
channel
closes
itself.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
explain.
you
will
find
it
in
both
of
these
reports.
when
this
new
channel
becomes
active,
as
you
see
it
goes
by
this
place
here,
what
it
tends
to
leave
settlement
right
there
and
the
front
end
or
the
head
of
it
is
they
call
6155
and
at
almost
any
stage
except
real
high
water,
you
will
not
have
sufficient
flow,
it
will
be
some
but
not
sufficient
flow
to
affect
anything.
that's
what
mr.
rogers
was
explaining
that
he
saw
in
1955
at
18-feet
on
the
gauge
a
foot
of
water
flowing
through
that.
you
could
walk
across
it
and
it
certainly
didn't
affect
any
thing.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
we
have
a
map
to
back
us
up
your
honor.
here's
the
map
of
1912
and
the
next
map
that
we
will
show
you
is
1929,
both
survey
maps.
and
on
this
1929
map,
it
shows
right
here
how
much
it
eroded
between
1912
and
1929.
you
got
a
picture
of
it.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
we
might
--
well
i
wanted
to
get
one
other
thing
before
i
go
forward
to
that
is
to
give
you
a
general
picture.
all
of
this
that
we
are
arguing
about,
about
when
did
it
stagnate
and
what
was
the
stage
of
the
river
involves
this
point
right
here.
you
have
the
agreed
state
line
at
1912,
1950.
here
is
where
the
state
of
tennessee
claimed
it
went
by
1929.
it
made
little
red
line.
so
that
we
say
the
river
moved
just
that
far
and
just
this
part,
that's
all.
this
has
never
moved
but
just
this
little
part.
so
when
we
talk
about
stagnation
and
arkansas
says
that
the
master
held
it
wrong
and
that
we
used
the
wrong
theory,
he
is
talking
only
about
this
little
piece
right
here
but
by
the
same
token,
he
says
that
it
moved
over
to
here.
he
just
lined
on
which
way
did
it
go.
it
did
move
for
short
while
after
that
and
wound
up
because
you
have
a
aerial
photograph
in
1929,
and
that
is
in
your
--
the
reply
brief
of
the
state
of
tennessee
showing
an
aerial
photograph
of
1929
and
there
it
is,
that's
the
picture
of
it,
of
the
river
as
it
was,
that's
the
abandoned
channel
6423.
so
we
are
not
theorizing.
we
are
going
by
a
record.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir
and
it
has
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
it
has
not
moved
since
that
time
at
all.
you
have
all
the
pictures
here
that
show,
that
is
the
reason
that
i
had
this
situation
here.
i
put
the
map
as
it
is
today.
this
is
the
one
that
the
master
has
as
appendix
1
to
his
report.
we
simply
enlarged
it
and
laid
it
over
the
1912
map
here
for
you
to
see.
and
here's
where
the
master
says
that
the
state
line
would
be.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
right
here
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
is
the
avulsive
or
our
new
channel,
just
as
their
old
channel
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
are
you
talking
about
as
it
is
today?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
do
you
mean
the
main
river?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
here
it
is
today.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it
varies
and
at
this
point
it's
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
right
here,
this
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half.
here
it's
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
from
1912
--
i
remember
at
1912,
we
are
in
accord
as
to
the
condition
thing.
from
1912
to
1965,
the
only
movement
of
the
state
line
has
been
this
area
right
here.
this
area
right
here,
that's
all.
we
will
explain
this
later.
but
as
to
the
stagnation
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
raised
with
you,
the
only
question
concerning
that
stagnation
is
where
they
stagnated
here
or
stagnated
here.
all
of
us
agree
that
it
is
stagnated.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
to
1929.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
there
was
a
movement
of
the
old
channel.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
the
dark
line.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
red
line
that
moved
to
there
in
1929
which
we
will
show
you
by
how
it
moved
and
show
you
the
maps
that
shows
the
movement
of
it,
but
that
is
all.
now,
the
state
of
arkansas
does
not
argue
about
this
movement
here.
they
say
the
stagnation,
they
argued
only
about
this
point
right
here
and
they
want
to
move
it
to
what
they
call
6720.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
they
get
on
to
a
theory
that
we
will
explain
later
on
concerning
that.
what
i
wanted
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
these
two
points
right
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
red
line
over
here
is
where
the
state
line
moved
from
here
to
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
as
it
was
at
that
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
to
here?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
all
the
same
as
it
was
in
1912.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
became
stagnated
between
1916
and
1925.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
1929,
excuse
me.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
occurred
long
before.
see
all
of
this
movement
occurred
prior
to
1929.
since
1929,
there
has
been
no
movement.
between
1913
which
is
this
map
right
here
and
the
next
survey
which
is
1929,
there
was
a
movement
of
the
abandoned
channel
to
this
light
degree.
neither
one
of
them
move
very
much
but
the
map
show
that
they
did
move.
now,
we
are
arguing
against
a
man
that
was
on
the
ground,
he
had
an
instrument
and
he
was
looking
through
it
and
he
was
measuring
and
he
says
“now
that's
where
the
river
went
to”.
now
the
presumption
of
the
law
is
between
these
two
periods
of
time
where
you
do
not
have
any
actual
evidence,
the
presumption
of
law
of
this
in
the
state
courts
is
that
that
movement
was
affected
by
erosion
and
accretion.
now,
we
have
two
maps
to
show
our
position.
mr.
smith
does
not
have
any
maps
to
show
how
he
arrived
its
missed
car
and
he
did
not
use
these
other
maps.
he
did
not
use
the
map
of
1929,
he
did
not
use
the
map
of
1980,
he
did
not
use
the
arkansas
map
itself
of
1921
which
supports
this
position
right
here.
so
i'm
saying
that
mr.
smith
arrived
at
his
opinion
by
his
--
only
by
his
experience
as
he
says,
but
in
using
his
experience
he
did
not
refer
to
maps
that
were
available
to
him
at
that
time.
now,
before
i
leave
this
map,
i
wanted
to
sort
to
say
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
we
crossed
examined
it.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
mr.
smith
never
conceded
anything
and
we
had
considerable
difficulty
getting
him
to
answer
question
and
that's
why
you
will
find
the
record
is
some
1300
pages
and
the
master
have
to
comment
on
that
more
than
once.
he
made
this
statement
in
the
course
of
his
discussions
that
he
first
said
that
there
was
no
avulsion
here.
that
was
his
statement
that
the
river
moved
up
into
this
place
and
then
has
moved
back.
and
then
says,
“well
i
just
couldn't
get
over
that
out
and
so
i
had
to
admit
there
was
an
avulsion
there,
but
i'm
not
sure
today”.
now
this
is
their
expert
witness
and
the
arkansas
testimony.
“i
am
not
sure
today
1965,
but
that
my
first
theory
was
the
better
one.”
that's
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
is
an
expert
witness.
he
doesn't
know
whether
there
is
an
avulsion
or
migration
and
so
testified
in
this
case,
so
that
we
are
faced
with
testimony
of
a
man
who
says
now
that
the
river
stagnated
that
is
7140.
when
he
first
said
it
didn't
stagnate
at
all.
so
i
can
understand
why
the
master
did
not
accept
his
theory.
now,
let
me
say
this,
the
master
didn't
accept
mr.
roger's
theory
about
the
ordinary
high
water,
he
just
said
when
it
ceases
to
flow
or
have
erosion
and
accretion
and
then
it
stagnated.
and
he
says
this
river
stagnated.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
you
honor,
he
didn't
say
at
any
stage.
he
said
that
the
water
becomes
stagnant,
that's
his
first
statement,
and
erosion
and
accretion
no
longer
occur
the
boundary
becomes
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
he
meant
to
buy.
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
said.
he
said
here
that
the
river
did
become
fixed,
that
the
river
ultimately
became
fixed
and
stagnated
and
the
abandoned
channel
as
the
result
of
avulsion
of
1913-15
is
now
clearly
visible
and
impressed
on
the
earth's
surface.
this
question
of
the
stage
of
the
river
is
a
false
question.
every
technical
man
who
had
been
here
says
the
stage
of
the
river
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
that
it's
whether
the
bed
of
the
river
can
be
moved.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
alright.
in
this
case,
the
upper
end
of
this
channel
had
closed
out
so
that
there
was
no
water
in
the
upper
end
at
all.
so
we
have
no
active
channel
even
though
water
may
flow
in
there
when
the
river
is
up.
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
how
much
erosion
could
occur?
you
don't
have
the
volume
of
water
nor
the
velocity
of
water
where
the
up
end
is
closed
in.
that
is
simply
the
fact
that
you
have
water
flowing
over
the
top
of
that,
i
think
they
call
it
river
dam
into
this
lower
bed.
you
have
water
flowing
in
there
but
you
don't
have
anything
that
is
active
and
you
don't
have
any
current
in
there
that
would
create
erosion
and
that
has
been
the
case
here
from
sometime
prior
to
1929.
prior
to
1929
when
it
did
finally
move
up
there
and
stopped,
it
has
remained
in
that
same
position,
since
1929
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
old
abandoned
channel.
before
i
go
further,
i
would
say
this
that
in
trying
to
describe
what's
going
on
--
from
now
on,
i
would
like
to
use
the
face
of
a
clock
and
saying
that
the
beginning
point
of
this
(inaudible)
would
be
at
3
o'clock
on
the
face
of
a
clock.
that
the
top
of
it
would
be
at
12
o'clock,
would
be
where
the
channel
begins
and
gets
enclosed
to
the
arkansas
shore
and
remains
there
on
round,
and
it
goes
on
round
from
12,
11,
10,
9,
8,
7
and
6
which
is
the
bottom
of
the
area
in
dispute.
now,
your
honor,
state
of
arkansas
has
made
a
statement
and
furnished
you
in
their
brief.
the
area
that
they
claim
is
from
which
they
measure
there's
two
miles
downstream
and
three
miles
upstream
and
so
on.
that
is
incorrect.
what
they
have
done
in
1913,
there
was
a
flood
which
started
this
avulsion
across
here
and
the
purpose
there
was
a
man
who
went
out
and
made
a
free-hand
sketch
on
an
old
map
showing
this
channel
cut
through
here
do
not
have
water
at
the
same
time,
he
made
a
general
triangular
area
which
he
said
was
the
remaining
land
of
tennessee
that
was
cut
off.
that
was
during
the
flood
water
which
was
54
feet
at
that
time
and
this
was
the
amount
of
land,
all
of
this
pink
area,
was
the
amount
of
land
that
was
visible
above
those
flood
waters
in
1913.
the
state
of
arkansas
has
taken
the
extreme
north
part
of
that
1913
high
water.
i
remember
this
that
this
land
at
that
moment
in
1913
was
much
larger
and
this
picture
shows
as
the
river
comes
up,
it
covers
more
of
the
edge
of
the
shore.
so
naturally
you
don't
have
as
much
land
sticking
out
of
the
water
but
when
the
river
went
back
down
all
of
this
land
appeared
again.
but
the
state
of
arkansas
takes
the
land
of
the
river
in
1925.
i
remember
this
is
1930,
they
draw
across
this
1925
land
and
color
that
and
say
that's
all
the
land
that
tennessee
had
in
this
case.
in
1913,
the
land
was
there
like
it
shows
in
1912
except
that
this
area
has
become
enlarged
but
they
have
taken
a
free-hand
sketch,
they
try
to
use
that
as
a
survey,
and
they
try
to
tell
us
that
was
the
land
that
we
had
in
1925
because
in
1925
the
new
channel,
this
is
the
new
channel
in
1925,
had
eroded
away
the
bottom
part
of
those
tennessee
accretions
up
to
this
line.
now
of
course,
at
the
same
time,
this
river
is
moving
up,
these
accretions
are
filling
in
here
and
they
just
forget
all
about
the
fact
that
their
accretions
here
and
say
that
this
original
piece
of
land.
in
other
words,
it's
two
miles
downstream
and
is
two
miles
over
this
way,
is
from
that
little
piece
of
land
that
he
took
off
from
a
flood
map
in
1930,
then
he
used
the
1925
map
to
try
to
limit
the
boundaries
of
it.
now,
in
1925,
the
new
river
--
the
new
channel
only
now,
remember
the
abandoned
channel
is
showing
here
as
stagnated.
it's
still
--
it's
in
this
position
and
shows
on
the
1929
map.
but
in
1925,
the
new
channel
did
come
up
and
rolled
away
so
that
the
lower
part
became
reactivated
that
is
the
lower
part.
now
there
you
have
the
difference
between
what
we
have
described
as
a
channel
of
the
river
where
water
comes
up
in
it
and
high
water
and
it
is
subject
to
movement.
well,
it's
only
if
it
becomes
active
as
a
channel
and
here
it
did
become
active.
now,
what
happened
because
of
that
active
point?
the
river
coming
around
here
actually
eat
just
a
little
bit
more
over
in
arkansas,
just
a
little
bit.
now,
it's
their
position
and
this
is
the
point
that
when
the
river
became
active
to
this
point
and
then
reversed
itself
and
started
back
down
which
i
will
show
you
later,
that
the
state
line
left
the
active
channel,
it
left
out
at
a
90-degree
angle
to
this
shoreline
of
the
new
channel
that
it
left
and
went
out
across
like
that.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
the
state
line
remains
in
the
old
channel
unless
it's
moved.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
admitted
by
the
state
of
arkansas
and
we
have
attested
an
exhibit
to
our
reply
brief
in
which
they
show
that
the
state
line
came
out
and
still
falling
right
along
down
here.
now
they
also
on
the
exhibit
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
went
just
a
little
further
in
arkansas
because
the
active
channel
was
eroding
away.
in
other
words,
the
two
combined
channels,
they
went
south
and
this
point
remained
up
against
the
bank.
now,
the
reason
for
that,
let's
go
back
to
our
original
picture,
and
you
have
the
rim
of
a
wheel
and
around
the
rim
of
that
wheel,
the
deepest
part
was
enclosed
to
the
bank.
and
the
channel
remained
there,
although
it
became
active,
that's
in
1925.
now,
the
next
period
of
time
at
which
there
is
a
survey,
i
remember
there
were
maps
between
1913
and
1929
but
they
were
not
full
survey
maps.
there
was
a
map
in
1917,
18
and
there
was
another
map
in
1921,
and
we
have
this
partial
survey
of
1925.
the
next
full
one
was
in
1929
at
which
time
--
now
here
is
this
1925
line
and
the
river
has
--
the
new
channel
only
has
reversed
itself
and
started
back
south
building
accretions.
and
here
is
the
aerial
photograph
showing
that
and
here
are
the
accretions,
as
i
was
just
saying
you
can
see
it
that
was
built,
but
you
see
that
this
channel
has
not
moved,
it
is
still
there.
these
accretions
build
only
to
this
part
that
is
in
tennessee
and
that
the
water
remained
between
the
tennessee
lands
and
the
arkansas
lands
at
all
times.
now,
as
the
land
build
down,
it
simply
separated
the
new
channel
from
the
old
but
because
it
always
remained
up
against
that
bank.
between
1925
and
1929,
it
eroded
this
bank
just
very
slightly.
after
1929,
nothing
has
moved.
in
other
words,
the
position
of
the
old
abandoned
channel
has
been
the
same
from
1929
today
even
though
it
was
active
for
a
time
between
1915
and
1925.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
that
time,
it
was
still
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
only
the
tennessee
lands
were
activated,
i
mean
eroded
or
added
to.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
only
the
new
channel
moved
during
that
time.
the
old
channel
never
moved.
it
became
active
but
it
stayed
right
where
it
was.
the
new
channel
is
the
one
the
moved
up
and
down
and
this
court
has
held
very
plainly
that
irrespective
of
the
movement
of
the
new
channel,
the
state
line
remains
in
the
old
channel
unless
the
old
channel
moves
by
erosion
and
accretion.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
there
is
record
of
the
tennessee
land
owner
claiming
it
and
he
traces
his
deeds
and
titles
from
the
us
patent
in
1828.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
as
i
say
he
traces
his
title
down
to
the
present
owner.
there
is
one
man
that
owns
his
land
in
tennessee
and
he
has
his
deeds
from
the
present
time
this
suit
began
clear
on
back
to
the
patents
that
were
originally
issued.
in
other
words,
he
can
trace
this
title
clear
on
back.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
the
entire
area
is
--
let
me
say
this.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
claims
all
of
it.
but
now,
i
have
to
explain
something
to
the
court
here.
as
you
notice
in
1929,
how
big
that
area
has
gotten?
well,
in
1967
a
great
deal
of
that
has
been
cut
off,
so
that
now
it's
back
up.
i
might
say
this
that
this
case
goes
long
enough
we
won't
have
a
land
left,
the
river
may
go
back
if
it
washed
all
the
way.
but
the
area
has
increased
and
decreased
during
the
last
15
to
20
years.
it
originally
started
out
as
1400
acres
and
the
highest
it
got
to
is
the
state
of
arkansas
claims
is
5000.
we
don't
think
it's
quite
that
much,
we
think
now
it's
about
3900
or
4000
acres,
and
that
would
only
be
developed
by
a
survey.
but
it
has
increased
and
decreased
because
this
new
channel
keeps
flopping
back
and
forth,
and
the
united
states
engineers
of
this
day
trying
of
what
they
call
stabilize
that
new
channel.
they
are
down
now
putting
in
dikes
and
they're
putting
in
revetments
and
all
other
thing
trying
to
stop
this
river
from
eating
away
which
it
shows
right
here
today,
it
was
beginning
to
eat
back
of
this
way
again.
in
other
words
this
new
channel
just
keeps
going
up
and
down
like
that.
the
old
channel
has
remained
silent,
ever
since
and,
of
course,
your
honor
says,
could
it
ever
be
changed.
if
that
river
ever
gotten
this
notion
it
won't
go
back
to
that
place
back
it
would.
and
i'd
say
this,
engineers
are
fine
people
but
when
the
river
gets
mad
at
you
it
just
goes
on
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it
maybe
this
and
it
go
back
up
there
and
start
accreting
to
arkansas
and
nail
on
it
but
it
doesn't
look
like
if
the
engineers
are
doing
a
wonderful
job
of
stabilizing
this
cut
that
has
been
established
here
later.
i
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
judge
black,
this
case
originally
started
in
1949
in
the
state
of
tennessee
in
which
the
title
to
the
tennessee
owner
was
put
in
question.
they
said
that
this
title
did
not
include
this
land.
that
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
it
was
held
by
that
court
that
he
did
have
the
title
to
this
land.
then
he
turned
around
and
filed
a
suit
against
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
that
time
your
honor
the
value
was
$15,000.00
and
you
heard
my
opponent
here
today
says
worth
a
half
million,
i
wish
it
was.
i
wish
it
was
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
it's
held
pending
all
of
these.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
in
1954,
the
tennessee
owner
filed
a
suit
against
the
arkansas
owners
who
were
over
that
claiming
the
land,
and
that
case
went
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
a
plea
and
abatement
as
to
whether
it
was
in
arkansas
and
tennessee.
then
it
came
back
to
the
state
courts
and
was
tried
on
the
question
of
acquiescence
and
that
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
where
it
is
now.
so
it's
been
in
litigation
since
1949
and
is
still
the
--
all
that
litigation
is
pending
now
while
the
question
of
whether
it's
an
arkansas
or
tennessee
is
settled.
so
as
far
as
ownership,
it's
been
tied
up.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
they
took
this
from
what
they
call
a
tax
title.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
arkansas
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
the
taxes
on
paid
that
goes
to
the
state,
the
state
can
sell
it
to
you.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
this
is
state
of
tennessee
is
the
last
one,
the
thick.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
about
one
mile
at
its
average
width
at
the
crossing
and
crossing
is
where
it
goes
from
one
circle
to
another
and
sometimes
it
gets
much
wider.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
about
one
mile.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
width
of
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
island
is
now
the
only
thing
separating
it
from
the
arkansas
shore
is
this
old
abandoned
channel
which
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
is
about
50
feet
wide
on
the
average.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
the
reason
i
wanted
to
point
at
this
map,
this
is
a
map
that
was
prepared
by
the
official
county
engineer
or
credit
in
the
county
arkansas.
on
this
--
this
is
for
the
year
1921.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
the
purpose
of
putting
this
map
in
here
this
island
or
this
piece
of
land
that
belongs
to
tennessee
is
drawn
in
this
particular
map
by
the
man
from
arkansas
and
he
shows
the
old
abandoned
channel
in
between
it
and
the
arkansas
shore.
now,
that
is
in
1921
and
there's
other
times,
when
the
state
of
arkansas
says
there
were
no
maps.
they
did
not
present
this
map
to
the
court.
they
did
not
use
it
in
any
of
their
deliberations
at
all.
they
had
to
come
out
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
because
of
the
limited
time
i
would
like
to
proceed
on
rather
swiftly
with
the
presentation
of
the
picture
from
these
maps.
after
1929,
the
next
official
map
that
had
survey
on
it
was
1937.
and
as
you
can
see,
some
of
the
low
channel,
the
active
channel
or
the
avulsion
channel
had
again
cut
back
here
a
little
bit
but
it
had
put
a
little
tail
than
here
but
if
you
will
notice
that
that
land
adds
only
to
tennessee.
it
does
not
touch
arkansas
at
any
place.
it
was
never
formed
in
any
part
of
arkansas
nor
on
this
side
of
the
old
gateway
channel
that
has
again
become
inactive
as
the
new
channel
moved
away
from
it.
the
next
year
on
which
there
was
a
survey
was
1949
and
this
one
you
will
notice
that
the
land
here
has
increased
in
size
greatly
because
the
avulsion
channel
has
moved
south
and
washed
away
a
great
deal
of
the
original
tennessee
land,
put
it
here.
now,
that's
where
it
gets
to
that
approximately
four
or
five
thousand
acres.
but
again
in
the
next
period
of
time
which
is
1965
and
the
survey
in
1967,
you
will
notice
at
a
great
deal
of
that
has
again
been
washed
away
by
the
new
channel
and
this
is
a
situation
as
it
is
today.
now,
the
only
change
for
this
land
between
1929
which
was
right,
here
is
the
addition
of
this
little
piece
right
there.
always
with
the
river
between
it
and
the
arkansas
shore,
at
all
times
this
land
had
remained
there
and
had
never
moved
and
never
come
out.
this
land
simply
added
on
to
the
tennessee
shore.
now,
that's
what
he's
talking
about
tailing
down
the
river.
well,
of
course
at
this
time,
here
is
the
river
and
the
new
channel
is
the
thing
it
is
moved.
now,
the
point
of
law
is
that
irrespective
of
the
movement
of
the
new
channel.
the
state
line
remains
in
that
old
channel
unless
it
becomes
active
again.
now,
i
would
like
to
wind
this
up
by
making
some
statements,
first
about
the
claim
of
prescription.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
tennessee
ever
acquiesced
in
the
state
of
arkansas
claim
of
sovereignty
over
this
particular
land.
note
that
the
master
found
to
that
no
evidence
that
they
ever
acquiesced
and
as
far
as
prescription
is
concerned,
they
can
of
course
obtain
the
control
of
this
land
if
tennessee
acquiesced
in
their
control
to
the
land.
the
record
is
replete
here
with
law
suits
from
1932.
in
1932,
there
was
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
at
memphis
to
determine,
if
this
is
part
of
the
same
area
of
land,
right
here
was
either
in
tennessee
or
arkansas
and
it
was
so
held
that
was
in
tennessee
in
1932.
that
was
a
suit
between
first
in
arkansas
and
one
in
tennessee.
then
we
have
the
series
of
suits
beginning
in
1949
coming
clear
to
date,
all
in
the
tennessee
courts
where
citizens
of
tennessee
are
recognized
by
the
courts
of
tennessee
as
being
the
owners
of
that
land.
remember
this
question
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
how
many
miles
from
the
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
about
one
mile,
yes
sir.
now,
i
was
measuring
in
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
they've
farmed
it
in
1932.
now,
i
must
say
this
about
this
land.
it
is
overflown
land.
now,
by
that
it
is
not
protected
by
(inaudible).
it
is
not
good
generally
for
farming
except
in
little
small
spots
and
there
is
a
spot
here
and
one
here
where
somebody
add
at
different
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
would
have
to
cross
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
they
used
a
boat.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
was
a
negro
man
that
went
over
there
and
farmed
for
a
while
and
i
think
the
high
water
came
along
and
wiped
them
out
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir
and
those
days
they
used
the
horse
and
mule
but
now
water
clear
up
something
about
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
got
it
over
there
but
they
had
--
they
supposed
to
have
a
mule
and
farmed
over
there
in
1932.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
know
where
they
kept
but
he
stayed
over
on
that
side
of
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
over
in
this
area
up
here
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
now,
one
part
i
want
to
get
at
no
one
has
ever
lived
on
this
land.
there
has
been
a
statement
by
my
counsel
or
opposing
counsel
from
arkansas
that
mr.
paget
once
lived
there,
he
did
not.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
oh
yes,
he
was.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
oh
no,
this
mile
from
here
to
here
is
what
i'm
talking
about
and
that's
all
tennessee.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
from
this
side
of
the
river?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it's
just
the
width
of
the
river
because
they
lived
on
this
side.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
would
be
that
mile
across
the
river
to
this
land.
yes
but
they're
always
in
tennessee.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
i
don't
–-
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
if
that's
why
he
abandoned
it
that
it
was
and
that
the
farming
that
has
been
spasmodic
all
the
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
thank
you.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
before
i
leave,
if
it's
permissible
with
the
opposing
counsel,
l
would
like
to
leave
this
for
the
courts.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i'll
just
let
it
informed.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justice,
the
state
of
tennessee
urges
that
you
overrule
the
exceptions
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
you
approve
and
confirm
the
report
of
the
master
and
in
a
decree
in
this
court
as
he
recommends.
the
case
that
we
have
before
you
involves
the
mighty
mississippi
river
and
you
are
going
to
now,
i
believe
change
your
positions
and
become
engineers
and
judicial
engineers
are
the
final
say
and
we
hope
to
present
to
you
now
and
picture
so
that
you
can
determine
that
position.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
now,
your
honor
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
can
you
see
mr.
justice?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
these
drawings
are
in
the
exhibits.
we
simply
made
copies
of
them
because
they
will
present
to
you
in
the
sort
of
a
pictorial
way
what
we
would
like
to
tell
you
this
afternoon.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
ordinarily
the
top
of
the
map
is
north
and
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
will
be
so
on
all
of
these
drawings
and
there
are
only
about
three
drawings
where
that
rule
is
not
used.
in
other
words
most
all
of
the
maps
that
you
see
in
this
case,
the
top
is
north.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
this
case
began
of
the
history
of
it
when
arkansas
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1836.
at
that
time,
the
united
states
government
made
a
survey
of
the
arkansas
land
as
it
came
up
to
the
river
bank
and
this
would
be
the
line
of
arkansas
in
1836.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
blue
is
the
water,
the
white
is
arkansas
and
this
pink
color
is
the
tennessee
lands
on
which
titles
were
traced
to
these
accretions.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
not
in
the
brief
but
there
is
a
report
by
mr.
rogers,
it's
tennessee's
exhibit
10
and
in
that
report
he
places
these
maps
in
a
reduced
form
so
that
you
have
the
complete
set
up
in
there.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
in
original
record.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir.
now
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
kind
to
take
these
by
steps.
in
1825
the
state
of
tennessee
was
also
surveyed
by
the
general
land
office
of
the
united
states
and
that
is
the
land
that
they
established.
so
that
by
those
two
original
land
surveys
in
that
period
of
time,
you
can
get
the
general
position
of
the
mississippi
river
at
the
time
arkansas
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now,
both
states
agree
that
at
this
time
that
the
state
line
between
arkansas
and
tennessee
was
in
what
is
known
as
the
thalweg
or
the
valley
way,
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
where
the
boat
run
as
it
goes
downstream.
now
you
have
the
next
one
we
have
here
was
the
survey
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
in
the
year
1877.
at
that
time
the
white
again
is
arkansas,
the
blue
is
the
mississippi
river
and
the
orange
color
is
the
added
lands
known
as
accretions,
now
what
this
court
has
described
the
addition
as
accretions.
now,
may
we
stop
a
moment
and
explain
about
the
erosion
and
accretion
that
is
occurring
at
this
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
the
orange
colored
area
is
the
land
added
by
accretions
to
the
original
tennessee
lands
holding
because
the
rivers
moving
this
way.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
none
at
this
time.
it
will
show
up
later,
yes
sir
and
it
will
be
colored
orange
so
that
you
will
be
able
to
distinguish
it.
what
i
wanted
to
explain
is
that
the
mississippi
river
originally
in
ancient
times
flowed
straight
south
upon
the
great
lakes
to
the
gulf,
as
it
did
certain
things
occurred
in
the
bed
of
the
river
you
would
have
a
rise,
you
would
have
hard
place
so
you
would
have
a
low
over
something
that
would
impede
that
flow
and
that
would
force
the
water
either
to
one
side
of
the
other
and
as
it
did
it
would
scar
the
bank.
and
as
it
scar
the
bank
then
of
course
the
water
would
move
along
with
it
and
as
time
progressed
it
would
develop
what
is
known
as
a
bin
in
the
river
and
around
this
bin,
the
best
way
to
understand
this
it
is
more
like
the
river
with
wheel.
this
is
the
rim
of
the
wheel
and
this
is
the
hook.
the
water
flowing
around
the
river
with
wheel
is
moving
faster
than
the
water
around
the
hook
and
the
movement
of
the
erosion
and
the
accretions
that
upon
by
the
movement
of
that
swift
water
occurs
around
this
out
of
rim
and
that
is
where
the
fast
water
cuts
the
bank
and
chase
the
water
in
suspension
downstream
until
it
is
slow
and
that
is
why
accretions
from
on
the
inner
side
because
the
water
is
flowing
slow.
so
let
us
proceed
this
was
a
survey
by
the
united
states
engineers
at
that
time
they
were
known
as
the
mississippi
river
commission
and
it's
a
survey
so
that
we
know
that
in
1877,
this
is
the
way
the
river
in
this
area
look.
the
next
time
we
were
able
to
find
a
survey
or
map
was
in
the
year
1904.
in
1877
to
1904,
here
again
we
show
the
original
tennessee
land
and
now
the
additional
forming
of
the
accretions
to
the
tennessee
shore
and
the
mississippi
river
is
again
cutting
further
into
the
state
of
arkansas
and
washing
away
its
lands.
now,
i
have
drawn
a
red
line
here
to
indicate
where
this
arkansas
shore
was
in
1877,
so
you
can
see
how
far
between
those
two
years
the
mississippi
river
actually
eroded
as
the
world
we
use
into
arkansas.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
is
still
in
the
thalweg.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
of
the
channel
of
the
river
as
it
goes
around
that
beam.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
may
not
be
the
center
but
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
--
it
was
a
case
from
this
court
that
it
remains
in
the
thalweg
which
is
generally
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
not
always
but
it's
where
the
boats
go.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
according
to
measurements
now
on
these
maps
in
1904
and
the
later
one
1912,
the
engineers
actually
measured
the
depth
of
the
water
that's
colored
blue
here
and
by
examining
those
maps
carefully
you
can
see
how
deep
the
water
is
and
those
measurements
mostly
in
most
cases
would
be
like
one
foot
here,
two
feet,
five
feet,
ten
feet,
thirty
feet,
fifty
feet
and
within
ten
feet
of
the
bank
it
would
be
30
feet
deep
on
the
out
of
rim
of
the
wheel.
in
other
words,
the
water
there
is
just
what
they
call
a
bluff
bank,
it
would
be
very
sharply
dropped
right
down
to
a
very
deep
depth
and
the
boats
actually
run
in
close
to
the
shore
as
they
go
around
this
band.
the
next
year
and
this
is
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
is
the
year
1912,
1915.
that
was
a
survey
again
by
the
united
states
engineers
in
which
they
surveyed
this
whole
area
and
this
is
the
drawing
that
matches
exactly
the
map
made
by
the
united
states
engineers.
in
this
case
you
will
see
that
the
river
has
moved
considerably
at
again
in
arkansas
and
that
there
is
the
beginning
of
the
avulsion
that
we
speak
up
that
occurred
in
1930.
now,
according
to
this
question
about
the
river
stagnating
at
low
water
or
high
water
which
will
get
to
in
a
few
minutes.
at
this
time
the
river
was
at
11
feet
and
at
11
feet
this
depth
through
here
was
on
seven
or
eight
feet
so
that
if
we
follow
this
low
water
or
zero
water,
then
at
that
time
we
had
no
channel
through
here
we
had
no
avulsion
because
at
zero
water
this
was
all
dry
land
from
right
here
to
right
here.
now,
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
won't
explain
that
in
detail
later
--
i
might
as
well
do
it
now.
the
engineers
designate
the
elevation
of
the
land
including
the
river
by
feet
or
numbers.
for
instance,
it
is
279
feet
on
this
shore
from
sea
level
at
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
other
words
the
land
rises
a
total
of
279
feet.
all
right,
at
these
locations
for
the
sake
of
navigation
they
tell
the
pilots
of
the
boats,
how
deep
the
river
is.
they
have
established
an
arbitrary
zero
as
they
call
it
at
some
200
and
say
60
feet
above
the
gulf
level.
and
that
zero,
that's
the
lowest
point
to
which
the
river
will
ordinarily
go
doing
its
ups
and
downs
doing
the
sea
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
low
water
is
3.2
feet
above
zero.
now,
the
point
is
that
that's
an
arbitrary
figure
for
the
purpose
of
these
men
on
the
river
to
know
whether
the
river
is
shallow
or
whether
it
has
got
a
lot
of
water
because
as
it
gets
shallow,
every
time
they
come
into
a
crossing
in
the
river,
it
will
be
five
or
six
feet
deep
or
maybe
eight
feet
deep
and
they
have
got
to
be
very
careful
in
getting
across
or
they
are
on
the
ground.
the
water
round
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
matthews.
now,
that
is
established
at
that
place
you
can
go
all
up
and
down
the
river
and
they
will
have
different
heights
and
gages
like
the
gage
at
helena
arkansas
is
different
from
the
one
at
cairo,
illinois
is
different
but
only
14
or
15
miles
from
this
point
is
a
gage
at
memphis
that
they
have
established
for
that
area.
the
3.2
feet
is
what
they
call
ordinary
low
water,
that's
when
the
water
sinks
to
in
the
dry
season.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
will
only
give
you
a
comparison.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right,
you
will
know.
now,
to
understand
this
low
and
high
water,
the
point
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
confused
here
is
they
speak
of
high
water
and
they
do
not
distinguish
between
ordinary
high
water
and
high
water.
ordinary
high
water
that
was
spoken
of
by
mr.
rogers
is
18
feet
on
this
memphis
gauge,
that
is
know
is
mid
bank
stages.
there
the
river
is
just
up
good
above
this
low
stage.
the
high
water
or
flood
water
is
around
40
feet
on
the
memphis
gauge.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
flood
waters
as
we
speak
of
are
when
they
get
above
that
figure.
in
other
words
the,
40
feet
would
be
the
measurement
at
the
top
of
the
bank
and
above
that
the
water
will
flow
over
into
the
low
lands.
now,
it's
still
confined
within
the
lewis
until
it
gets
above
50
and
55
feet
but
it
is
over
its
own
banks
at
40
feet.
now,
to
this
point
in
time,
this
is
1912
and
1950
the
state
of
arkansas
has
conceded
and
agreed
with
tennessee
that
these
accretions
moved
over
into
this
position
and
that
the
arkansas
shore
was
eroded
to
that
position,
that
the
approximate
state
line
is
shown
by
this
black
line.
now,
they
have
a
map
that
they
have
in
here
which
they
have
placed
the
state
line
on
it
and
we
have
one
where
we
placed
the
state
line
but
for
most
cases
in
accord,
there
might
be
some
variation
a
little
bit
about
where
there
was
--
the
depth
was
shown
in
two
places
and
one
will
take
one
side
one
on
the
other.
but
this
would
be
the
state
line
in
1912
as
the
--
just
before
the
avulsion
occurred.
now,
your
honors
when
this
case
first
began
in
1968,
the
state
of
arkansas
said
there
was
no
avulsion.
that's
what
they
plead
in
the
case.
there
was
no
avulsion.
they
said
that
the
river
migrated
and
migration
is
by
erosion
and
accretion.
the
road
on
one
side
and
accretions
formed
on
the
other.
they
said
that
the
river
migrated
up
to
this
position
in
1912.
then
they
say
that
it
reversed
itself
and
migrated
back
down
so
that
today,
where
it
has
migrated
is
the
same
river
we
had
here
and
there
was
no
avulsion,
and
that's
the
state
when
of
their
expert
witness,
when
they
plead.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
i
was
going
down,
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
is
as
it
is
today.
now,
we
have
attached
here
to
a
copy
of
the
aerial
photograph
which
is
the
exhibit.
there
was
a
picture
from
an
airplane
mean
all
this
land
and
we
took
that
picture
laid
it
over
here
so
that
you
could
see
just
how
they
compare.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
river
is
at
this
point.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
this
area.
now,
i
have
one
of
these
maps
set
here
but
it's
not
the
total
to
show
the
comparison
but
the
reason
we
want
to
do
that
was
for
this
area
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
your
honor,
we
will
go
through
from
begin
and
the
end.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
over
lay
is
also
a
copy
of
the
aerial
photograph
of
1965.
in
the
few
minutes
i'll
explain
why
it's
here.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
that
when
they
first
began
this
case
the
state
of
arkansas
said
there
was
no
avulsion
that
the
river
migrated
up
to
the
position
it
is
here,
then
it
migrated
back
down,
that
is
by
erosion
and
accretion
and
that
no
avulsion
ever
occurred
and
that
the
river
did
not
stagnate
and
this
is
by
mr.
smith,
their
own
witness
says,
“no,
it
didn't
stagnate
it
moves
out
and
it
moved
back.”
until
they
got
in
to
the
trial
of
the
case
before
the
master
and
either
i
think
it
was
the
second
day
that
they
were
there.
they
change
their
position
and
they
said,
“yes,
we
admit
now
that
it
did
there
was
avulsion,
that
this
channel
did
fall
and
that
the
river
did
not
migrate
back
out
as
we
claim.”
see,
they
first
said
that
it
migrated
up
this
way
and
then
came
back
east
to
where
it
is
today.
in
the
middle
of
appearing
before
the
master,
they
admitted
that
this
avulsion
occurred
and
said
that
the
river
instead
of
migrating
back
to
where
it
is
today
migrated
on
further
westward.
they
positioned
by
like
that
where
it
stagnated
at
low
water
and
that's
the
argument
of
arkansas
but
on
that
point
there
are
witness
on
whom
they're
relying
made
this
statement
that
is
in
the
record,
that
the
stage
of
the
river
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
stagnation.
that's
his
own
testimony
in
this
case.
he
says
that
whether
the
river
is
at
low
water
or
high
water
or
whatever
stage
it
is,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
stagnation.
mr.
roger
says
that
it
is
possible
for
the
river
to
be
moved
by
erosion
and
accretions
when
it
gets
up
to
about
ordinary
high
water
because
that's
the
line
he
says
where
the
vegetation
ceases,
says
it
possible.
now,
he
didn't
say
that
that's
when
it
stagnates
nor
did
the
master
say
that's
when
it
stagnates.
the
master's
statements
to
me
is
one
that
this
court
could
follow
with
and
never
have
to
worry
about
to
be
an
outline.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
on
page
seven
of
the
master's
report
in
the
second
paragraph.
let
see
it's
line
20
--
beginning
at
line
23,
that
would
be
about
2/3
of
the
way
down
and
the
master
says
this,
“and
when
the
water
becomes
stagnant
and
erosion
and
accretion
no
longer
occur,
the
boundary
becomes
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
old
channel.”
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
says
that
if
erosion
and
accretion
occur.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right,
you
say
that
just
like
mr.
smith
said
it
is
not
the
stage
of
the
river
that
causes
this.
if
the
riverbed
moves
then
you
have
and
it
move
by
erosion
and
accretion,
then
it
is
not
stagnated
but
when
the
bed
does
not
move
which
is
the
same
thing
that
the
master
has
said
as
long
as
erosion
and
accretion
doesn't
occur.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
that
would
depend
on
--
merely
to
think
it
is
possible,
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
low
is
that.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
if
it
erodes,
this
court
has
said
itself
that
so
long
as
the
old
channel
can
be
moved
by
erosion
and
accretion.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
the
point
your
honor,
if
there
is
enough
water
in
there
to
cause
it
to
erode,
it
is
an
active
channel.
it
could
not
be
otherwise.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
now
your
honor,
like
the
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
it
has
not
moved
since
1929.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
had
been
two
very
high
and
extremely
bad
floods.
the
one
of
1937
is
the
one
that
caused
congress
to
reenact
the
flood
control
bill
and
that
case
of
1937
and
1947
neither
of
which
had
any
effect
on
this
situation
here.
it
is
not
the
fact,
the
height
of
the
water.
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
again
becomes
an
active
channel.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
you
have
erosion
and
accretion
there.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
your
honor
let
me
answer
that
in
this
fashion.
in
1932
a
river
board,
a
125
feet
long
and
15
feet
wide
went
through
this
channel
here
but
only
doing
the
stage
of
the
river
when
the
water
was
above
20
feet
is
what
the
man
said
it
was
about
20
feet,
a
little
above
mid
stage.
he
went
through
down
a
boat
because
he
went
through
for
a
purpose,
but
the
river
boats
would
not
have
gone
through
there
at
all
because
even
though
water
was
flowing
in
there
at
that
time,
it
was
not
an
active
channel,
and
there
was
no
way
for
the
regular
boats
to
go
in
there.
you
see,
if
it's
an
active
channel,
it
will
scar
out
its
bed
and
move
its
bed
some
--
if
it
moves
its
bed,
and
that
is
the
only
time
that
it
would
affect
a
state
line
as
when
it
becomes
active.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir
your
honor,
let
me
explain
there
and
let's
take
this
particular
situation
as
an
example.
in
1929,
this
channel
had
already
closed.
now,
there
is
a
peculiar
phenomenon
that
goes
on
when
a
channel
is
abandoned
and
this
you
will
find
in
the
reports
of
both
mr.
smith
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
channel
closes
itself.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
explain.
you
will
find
it
in
both
of
these
reports.
when
this
new
channel
becomes
active,
as
you
see
it
goes
by
this
place
here,
what
it
tends
to
leave
settlement
right
there
and
the
front
end
or
the
head
of
it
is
they
call
6155
and
at
almost
any
stage
except
real
high
water,
you
will
not
have
sufficient
flow,
it
will
be
some
but
not
sufficient
flow
to
affect
anything.
that's
what
mr.
rogers
was
explaining
that
he
saw
in
1955
at
18-feet
on
the
gauge
a
foot
of
water
flowing
through
that.
you
could
walk
across
it
and
it
certainly
didn't
affect
any
thing.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
we
have
a
map
to
back
us
up
your
honor.
here's
the
map
of
1912
and
the
next
map
that
we
will
show
you
is
1929,
both
survey
maps.
and
on
this
1929
map,
it
shows
right
here
how
much
it
eroded
between
1912
and
1929.
you
got
a
picture
of
it.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
we
might
--
well
i
wanted
to
get
one
other
thing
before
i
go
forward
to
that
is
to
give
you
a
general
picture.
all
of
this
that
we
are
arguing
about,
about
when
did
it
stagnate
and
what
was
the
stage
of
the
river
involves
this
point
right
here.
you
have
the
agreed
state
line
at
1912,
1950.
here
is
where
the
state
of
tennessee
claimed
it
went
by
1929.
it
made
little
red
line.
so
that
we
say
the
river
moved
just
that
far
and
just
this
part,
that's
all.
this
has
never
moved
but
just
this
little
part.
so
when
we
talk
about
stagnation
and
arkansas
says
that
the
master
held
it
wrong
and
that
we
used
the
wrong
theory,
he
is
talking
only
about
this
little
piece
right
here
but
by
the
same
token,
he
says
that
it
moved
over
to
here.
he
just
lined
on
which
way
did
it
go.
it
did
move
for
short
while
after
that
and
wound
up
because
you
have
a
aerial
photograph
in
1929,
and
that
is
in
your
--
the
reply
brief
of
the
state
of
tennessee
showing
an
aerial
photograph
of
1929
and
there
it
is,
that's
the
picture
of
it,
of
the
river
as
it
was,
that's
the
abandoned
channel
6423.
so
we
are
not
theorizing.
we
are
going
by
a
record.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir
and
it
has
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
it
has
not
moved
since
that
time
at
all.
you
have
all
the
pictures
here
that
show,
that
is
the
reason
that
i
had
this
situation
here.
i
put
the
map
as
it
is
today.
this
is
the
one
that
the
master
has
as
appendix
1
to
his
report.
we
simply
enlarged
it
and
laid
it
over
the
1912
map
here
for
you
to
see.
and
here's
where
the
master
says
that
the
state
line
would
be.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
right
here
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
is
the
avulsive
or
our
new
channel,
just
as
their
old
channel
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
are
you
talking
about
as
it
is
today?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
do
you
mean
the
main
river?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
here
it
is
today.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it
varies
and
at
this
point
it's
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
right
here,
this
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half.
here
it's
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
from
1912
--
i
remember
at
1912,
we
are
in
accord
as
to
the
condition
thing.
from
1912
to
1965,
the
only
movement
of
the
state
line
has
been
this
area
right
here.
this
area
right
here,
that's
all.
we
will
explain
this
later.
but
as
to
the
stagnation
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
raised
with
you,
the
only
question
concerning
that
stagnation
is
where
they
stagnated
here
or
stagnated
here.
all
of
us
agree
that
it
is
stagnated.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
to
1929.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
there
was
a
movement
of
the
old
channel.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
the
dark
line.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
red
line
that
moved
to
there
in
1929
which
we
will
show
you
by
how
it
moved
and
show
you
the
maps
that
shows
the
movement
of
it,
but
that
is
all.
now,
the
state
of
arkansas
does
not
argue
about
this
movement
here.
they
say
the
stagnation,
they
argued
only
about
this
point
right
here
and
they
want
to
move
it
to
what
they
call
6720.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
they
get
on
to
a
theory
that
we
will
explain
later
on
concerning
that.
what
i
wanted
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
would
be
these
two
points
right
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
red
line
over
here
is
where
the
state
line
moved
from
here
to
here.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
as
it
was
at
that
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
to
here?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
all
the
same
as
it
was
in
1912.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
became
stagnated
between
1916
and
1925.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
1929,
excuse
me.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
occurred
long
before.
see
all
of
this
movement
occurred
prior
to
1929.
since
1929,
there
has
been
no
movement.
between
1913
which
is
this
map
right
here
and
the
next
survey
which
is
1929,
there
was
a
movement
of
the
abandoned
channel
to
this
light
degree.
neither
one
of
them
move
very
much
but
the
map
show
that
they
did
move.
now,
we
are
arguing
against
a
man
that
was
on
the
ground,
he
had
an
instrument
and
he
was
looking
through
it
and
he
was
measuring
and
he
says
“now
that's
where
the
river
went
to”.
now
the
presumption
of
the
law
is
between
these
two
periods
of
time
where
you
do
not
have
any
actual
evidence,
the
presumption
of
law
of
this
in
the
state
courts
is
that
that
movement
was
affected
by
erosion
and
accretion.
now,
we
have
two
maps
to
show
our
position.
mr.
smith
does
not
have
any
maps
to
show
how
he
arrived
its
missed
car
and
he
did
not
use
these
other
maps.
he
did
not
use
the
map
of
1929,
he
did
not
use
the
map
of
1980,
he
did
not
use
the
arkansas
map
itself
of
1921
which
supports
this
position
right
here.
so
i'm
saying
that
mr.
smith
arrived
at
his
opinion
by
his
--
only
by
his
experience
as
he
says,
but
in
using
his
experience
he
did
not
refer
to
maps
that
were
available
to
him
at
that
time.
now,
before
i
leave
this
map,
i
wanted
to
sort
to
say
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
we
crossed
examined
it.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
mr.
smith
never
conceded
anything
and
we
had
considerable
difficulty
getting
him
to
answer
question
and
that's
why
you
will
find
the
record
is
some
1300
pages
and
the
master
have
to
comment
on
that
more
than
once.
he
made
this
statement
in
the
course
of
his
discussions
that
he
first
said
that
there
was
no
avulsion
here.
that
was
his
statement
that
the
river
moved
up
into
this
place
and
then
has
moved
back.
and
then
says,
“well
i
just
couldn't
get
over
that
out
and
so
i
had
to
admit
there
was
an
avulsion
there,
but
i'm
not
sure
today”.
now
this
is
their
expert
witness
and
the
arkansas
testimony.
“i
am
not
sure
today
1965,
but
that
my
first
theory
was
the
better
one.”
that's
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
is
an
expert
witness.
he
doesn't
know
whether
there
is
an
avulsion
or
migration
and
so
testified
in
this
case,
so
that
we
are
faced
with
testimony
of
a
man
who
says
now
that
the
river
stagnated
that
is
7140.
when
he
first
said
it
didn't
stagnate
at
all.
so
i
can
understand
why
the
master
did
not
accept
his
theory.
now,
let
me
say
this,
the
master
didn't
accept
mr.
roger's
theory
about
the
ordinary
high
water,
he
just
said
when
it
ceases
to
flow
or
have
erosion
and
accretion
and
then
it
stagnated.
and
he
says
this
river
stagnated.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
you
honor,
he
didn't
say
at
any
stage.
he
said
that
the
water
becomes
stagnant,
that's
his
first
statement,
and
erosion
and
accretion
no
longer
occur
the
boundary
becomes
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
he
meant
to
buy.
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
said.
he
said
here
that
the
river
did
become
fixed,
that
the
river
ultimately
became
fixed
and
stagnated
and
the
abandoned
channel
as
the
result
of
avulsion
of
1913-15
is
now
clearly
visible
and
impressed
on
the
earth's
surface.
this
question
of
the
stage
of
the
river
is
a
false
question.
every
technical
man
who
had
been
here
says
the
stage
of
the
river
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
that
it's
whether
the
bed
of
the
river
can
be
moved.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
alright.
in
this
case,
the
upper
end
of
this
channel
had
closed
out
so
that
there
was
no
water
in
the
upper
end
at
all.
so
we
have
no
active
channel
even
though
water
may
flow
in
there
when
the
river
is
up.
but
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
how
much
erosion
could
occur?
you
don't
have
the
volume
of
water
nor
the
velocity
of
water
where
the
up
end
is
closed
in.
that
is
simply
the
fact
that
you
have
water
flowing
over
the
top
of
that,
i
think
they
call
it
river
dam
into
this
lower
bed.
you
have
water
flowing
in
there
but
you
don't
have
anything
that
is
active
and
you
don't
have
any
current
in
there
that
would
create
erosion
and
that
has
been
the
case
here
from
sometime
prior
to
1929.
prior
to
1929
when
it
did
finally
move
up
there
and
stopped,
it
has
remained
in
that
same
position,
since
1929
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
old
abandoned
channel.
before
i
go
further,
i
would
say
this
that
in
trying
to
describe
what's
going
on
--
from
now
on,
i
would
like
to
use
the
face
of
a
clock
and
saying
that
the
beginning
point
of
this
(inaudible)
would
be
at
3
o'clock
on
the
face
of
a
clock.
that
the
top
of
it
would
be
at
12
o'clock,
would
be
where
the
channel
begins
and
gets
enclosed
to
the
arkansas
shore
and
remains
there
on
round,
and
it
goes
on
round
from
12,
11,
10,
9,
8,
7
and
6
which
is
the
bottom
of
the
area
in
dispute.
now,
your
honor,
state
of
arkansas
has
made
a
statement
and
furnished
you
in
their
brief.
the
area
that
they
claim
is
from
which
they
measure
there's
two
miles
downstream
and
three
miles
upstream
and
so
on.
that
is
incorrect.
what
they
have
done
in
1913,
there
was
a
flood
which
started
this
avulsion
across
here
and
the
purpose
there
was
a
man
who
went
out
and
made
a
free-hand
sketch
on
an
old
map
showing
this
channel
cut
through
here
do
not
have
water
at
the
same
time,
he
made
a
general
triangular
area
which
he
said
was
the
remaining
land
of
tennessee
that
was
cut
off.
that
was
during
the
flood
water
which
was
54
feet
at
that
time
and
this
was
the
amount
of
land,
all
of
this
pink
area,
was
the
amount
of
land
that
was
visible
above
those
flood
waters
in
1913.
the
state
of
arkansas
has
taken
the
extreme
north
part
of
that
1913
high
water.
i
remember
this
that
this
land
at
that
moment
in
1913
was
much
larger
and
this
picture
shows
as
the
river
comes
up,
it
covers
more
of
the
edge
of
the
shore.
so
naturally
you
don't
have
as
much
land
sticking
out
of
the
water
but
when
the
river
went
back
down
all
of
this
land
appeared
again.
but
the
state
of
arkansas
takes
the
land
of
the
river
in
1925.
i
remember
this
is
1930,
they
draw
across
this
1925
land
and
color
that
and
say
that's
all
the
land
that
tennessee
had
in
this
case.
in
1913,
the
land
was
there
like
it
shows
in
1912
except
that
this
area
has
become
enlarged
but
they
have
taken
a
free-hand
sketch,
they
try
to
use
that
as
a
survey,
and
they
try
to
tell
us
that
was
the
land
that
we
had
in
1925
because
in
1925
the
new
channel,
this
is
the
new
channel
in
1925,
had
eroded
away
the
bottom
part
of
those
tennessee
accretions
up
to
this
line.
now
of
course,
at
the
same
time,
this
river
is
moving
up,
these
accretions
are
filling
in
here
and
they
just
forget
all
about
the
fact
that
their
accretions
here
and
say
that
this
original
piece
of
land.
in
other
words,
it's
two
miles
downstream
and
is
two
miles
over
this
way,
is
from
that
little
piece
of
land
that
he
took
off
from
a
flood
map
in
1930,
then
he
used
the
1925
map
to
try
to
limit
the
boundaries
of
it.
now,
in
1925,
the
new
river
--
the
new
channel
only
now,
remember
the
abandoned
channel
is
showing
here
as
stagnated.
it's
still
--
it's
in
this
position
and
shows
on
the
1929
map.
but
in
1925,
the
new
channel
did
come
up
and
rolled
away
so
that
the
lower
part
became
reactivated
that
is
the
lower
part.
now
there
you
have
the
difference
between
what
we
have
described
as
a
channel
of
the
river
where
water
comes
up
in
it
and
high
water
and
it
is
subject
to
movement.
well,
it's
only
if
it
becomes
active
as
a
channel
and
here
it
did
become
active.
now,
what
happened
because
of
that
active
point?
the
river
coming
around
here
actually
eat
just
a
little
bit
more
over
in
arkansas,
just
a
little
bit.
now,
it's
their
position
and
this
is
the
point
that
when
the
river
became
active
to
this
point
and
then
reversed
itself
and
started
back
down
which
i
will
show
you
later,
that
the
state
line
left
the
active
channel,
it
left
out
at
a
90-degree
angle
to
this
shoreline
of
the
new
channel
that
it
left
and
went
out
across
like
that.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
the
state
line
remains
in
the
old
channel
unless
it's
moved.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
admitted
by
the
state
of
arkansas
and
we
have
attested
an
exhibit
to
our
reply
brief
in
which
they
show
that
the
state
line
came
out
and
still
falling
right
along
down
here.
now
they
also
on
the
exhibit
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
went
just
a
little
further
in
arkansas
because
the
active
channel
was
eroding
away.
in
other
words,
the
two
combined
channels,
they
went
south
and
this
point
remained
up
against
the
bank.
now,
the
reason
for
that,
let's
go
back
to
our
original
picture,
and
you
have
the
rim
of
a
wheel
and
around
the
rim
of
that
wheel,
the
deepest
part
was
enclosed
to
the
bank.
and
the
channel
remained
there,
although
it
became
active,
that's
in
1925.
now,
the
next
period
of
time
at
which
there
is
a
survey,
i
remember
there
were
maps
between
1913
and
1929
but
they
were
not
full
survey
maps.
there
was
a
map
in
1917,
18
and
there
was
another
map
in
1921,
and
we
have
this
partial
survey
of
1925.
the
next
full
one
was
in
1929
at
which
time
--
now
here
is
this
1925
line
and
the
river
has
--
the
new
channel
only
has
reversed
itself
and
started
back
south
building
accretions.
and
here
is
the
aerial
photograph
showing
that
and
here
are
the
accretions,
as
i
was
just
saying
you
can
see
it
that
was
built,
but
you
see
that
this
channel
has
not
moved,
it
is
still
there.
these
accretions
build
only
to
this
part
that
is
in
tennessee
and
that
the
water
remained
between
the
tennessee
lands
and
the
arkansas
lands
at
all
times.
now,
as
the
land
build
down,
it
simply
separated
the
new
channel
from
the
old
but
because
it
always
remained
up
against
that
bank.
between
1925
and
1929,
it
eroded
this
bank
just
very
slightly.
after
1929,
nothing
has
moved.
in
other
words,
the
position
of
the
old
abandoned
channel
has
been
the
same
from
1929
today
even
though
it
was
active
for
a
time
between
1915
and
1925.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
that
time,
it
was
still
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
only
the
tennessee
lands
were
activated,
i
mean
eroded
or
added
to.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
only
the
new
channel
moved
during
that
time.
the
old
channel
never
moved.
it
became
active
but
it
stayed
right
where
it
was.
the
new
channel
is
the
one
the
moved
up
and
down
and
this
court
has
held
very
plainly
that
irrespective
of
the
movement
of
the
new
channel,
the
state
line
remains
in
the
old
channel
unless
the
old
channel
moves
by
erosion
and
accretion.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
there
is
record
of
the
tennessee
land
owner
claiming
it
and
he
traces
his
deeds
and
titles
from
the
us
patent
in
1828.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
as
i
say
he
traces
his
title
down
to
the
present
owner.
there
is
one
man
that
owns
his
land
in
tennessee
and
he
has
his
deeds
from
the
present
time
this
suit
began
clear
on
back
to
the
patents
that
were
originally
issued.
in
other
words,
he
can
trace
this
title
clear
on
back.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
the
entire
area
is
--
let
me
say
this.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
claims
all
of
it.
but
now,
i
have
to
explain
something
to
the
court
here.
as
you
notice
in
1929,
how
big
that
area
has
gotten?
well,
in
1967
a
great
deal
of
that
has
been
cut
off,
so
that
now
it's
back
up.
i
might
say
this
that
this
case
goes
long
enough
we
won't
have
a
land
left,
the
river
may
go
back
if
it
washed
all
the
way.
but
the
area
has
increased
and
decreased
during
the
last
15
to
20
years.
it
originally
started
out
as
1400
acres
and
the
highest
it
got
to
is
the
state
of
arkansas
claims
is
5000.
we
don't
think
it's
quite
that
much,
we
think
now
it's
about
3900
or
4000
acres,
and
that
would
only
be
developed
by
a
survey.
but
it
has
increased
and
decreased
because
this
new
channel
keeps
flopping
back
and
forth,
and
the
united
states
engineers
of
this
day
trying
of
what
they
call
stabilize
that
new
channel.
they
are
down
now
putting
in
dikes
and
they're
putting
in
revetments
and
all
other
thing
trying
to
stop
this
river
from
eating
away
which
it
shows
right
here
today,
it
was
beginning
to
eat
back
of
this
way
again.
in
other
words
this
new
channel
just
keeps
going
up
and
down
like
that.
the
old
channel
has
remained
silent,
ever
since
and,
of
course,
your
honor
says,
could
it
ever
be
changed.
if
that
river
ever
gotten
this
notion
it
won't
go
back
to
that
place
back
it
would.
and
i'd
say
this,
engineers
are
fine
people
but
when
the
river
gets
mad
at
you
it
just
goes
on
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it
maybe
this
and
it
go
back
up
there
and
start
accreting
to
arkansas
and
nail
on
it
but
it
doesn't
look
like
if
the
engineers
are
doing
a
wonderful
job
of
stabilizing
this
cut
that
has
been
established
here
later.
i
wanted
to
get
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
judge
black,
this
case
originally
started
in
1949
in
the
state
of
tennessee
in
which
the
title
to
the
tennessee
owner
was
put
in
question.
they
said
that
this
title
did
not
include
this
land.
that
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
it
was
held
by
that
court
that
he
did
have
the
title
to
this
land.
then
he
turned
around
and
filed
a
suit
against
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
at
that
time
your
honor
the
value
was
$15,000.00
and
you
heard
my
opponent
here
today
says
worth
a
half
million,
i
wish
it
was.
i
wish
it
was
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
it's
held
pending
all
of
these.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well
in
1954,
the
tennessee
owner
filed
a
suit
against
the
arkansas
owners
who
were
over
that
claiming
the
land,
and
that
case
went
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
a
plea
and
abatement
as
to
whether
it
was
in
arkansas
and
tennessee.
then
it
came
back
to
the
state
courts
and
was
tried
on
the
question
of
acquiescence
and
that
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
where
it
is
now.
so
it's
been
in
litigation
since
1949
and
is
still
the
--
all
that
litigation
is
pending
now
while
the
question
of
whether
it's
an
arkansas
or
tennessee
is
settled.
so
as
far
as
ownership,
it's
been
tied
up.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
they
took
this
from
what
they
call
a
tax
title.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
arkansas
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
the
taxes
on
paid
that
goes
to
the
state,
the
state
can
sell
it
to
you.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir,
this
is
state
of
tennessee
is
the
last
one,
the
thick.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it's
about
one
mile
at
its
average
width
at
the
crossing
and
crossing
is
where
it
goes
from
one
circle
to
another
and
sometimes
it
gets
much
wider.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
about
one
mile.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
width
of
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
the
island
is
now
the
only
thing
separating
it
from
the
arkansas
shore
is
this
old
abandoned
channel
which
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
that
is
about
50
feet
wide
on
the
average.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
the
reason
i
wanted
to
point
at
this
map,
this
is
a
map
that
was
prepared
by
the
official
county
engineer
or
credit
in
the
county
arkansas.
on
this
--
this
is
for
the
year
1921.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
the
purpose
of
putting
this
map
in
here
this
island
or
this
piece
of
land
that
belongs
to
tennessee
is
drawn
in
this
particular
map
by
the
man
from
arkansas
and
he
shows
the
old
abandoned
channel
in
between
it
and
the
arkansas
shore.
now,
that
is
in
1921
and
there's
other
times,
when
the
state
of
arkansas
says
there
were
no
maps.
they
did
not
present
this
map
to
the
court.
they
did
not
use
it
in
any
of
their
deliberations
at
all.
they
had
to
come
out
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
because
of
the
limited
time
i
would
like
to
proceed
on
rather
swiftly
with
the
presentation
of
the
picture
from
these
maps.
after
1929,
the
next
official
map
that
had
survey
on
it
was
1937.
and
as
you
can
see,
some
of
the
low
channel,
the
active
channel
or
the
avulsion
channel
had
again
cut
back
here
a
little
bit
but
it
had
put
a
little
tail
than
here
but
if
you
will
notice
that
that
land
adds
only
to
tennessee.
it
does
not
touch
arkansas
at
any
place.
it
was
never
formed
in
any
part
of
arkansas
nor
on
this
side
of
the
old
gateway
channel
that
has
again
become
inactive
as
the
new
channel
moved
away
from
it.
the
next
year
on
which
there
was
a
survey
was
1949
and
this
one
you
will
notice
that
the
land
here
has
increased
in
size
greatly
because
the
avulsion
channel
has
moved
south
and
washed
away
a
great
deal
of
the
original
tennessee
land,
put
it
here.
now,
that's
where
it
gets
to
that
approximately
four
or
five
thousand
acres.
but
again
in
the
next
period
of
time
which
is
1965
and
the
survey
in
1967,
you
will
notice
at
a
great
deal
of
that
has
again
been
washed
away
by
the
new
channel
and
this
is
a
situation
as
it
is
today.
now,
the
only
change
for
this
land
between
1929
which
was
right,
here
is
the
addition
of
this
little
piece
right
there.
always
with
the
river
between
it
and
the
arkansas
shore,
at
all
times
this
land
had
remained
there
and
had
never
moved
and
never
come
out.
this
land
simply
added
on
to
the
tennessee
shore.
now,
that's
what
he's
talking
about
tailing
down
the
river.
well,
of
course
at
this
time,
here
is
the
river
and
the
new
channel
is
the
thing
it
is
moved.
now,
the
point
of
law
is
that
irrespective
of
the
movement
of
the
new
channel.
the
state
line
remains
in
that
old
channel
unless
it
becomes
active
again.
now,
i
would
like
to
wind
this
up
by
making
some
statements,
first
about
the
claim
of
prescription.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
tennessee
ever
acquiesced
in
the
state
of
arkansas
claim
of
sovereignty
over
this
particular
land.
note
that
the
master
found
to
that
no
evidence
that
they
ever
acquiesced
and
as
far
as
prescription
is
concerned,
they
can
of
course
obtain
the
control
of
this
land
if
tennessee
acquiesced
in
their
control
to
the
land.
the
record
is
replete
here
with
law
suits
from
1932.
in
1932,
there
was
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
at
memphis
to
determine,
if
this
is
part
of
the
same
area
of
land,
right
here
was
either
in
tennessee
or
arkansas
and
it
was
so
held
that
was
in
tennessee
in
1932.
that
was
a
suit
between
first
in
arkansas
and
one
in
tennessee.
then
we
have
the
series
of
suits
beginning
in
1949
coming
clear
to
date,
all
in
the
tennessee
courts
where
citizens
of
tennessee
are
recognized
by
the
courts
of
tennessee
as
being
the
owners
of
that
land.
remember
this
question
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
how
many
miles
from
the
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
about
one
mile,
yes
sir.
now,
i
was
measuring
in
this
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor,
there
are
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes,
they've
farmed
it
in
1932.
now,
i
must
say
this
about
this
land.
it
is
overflown
land.
now,
by
that
it
is
not
protected
by
(inaudible).
it
is
not
good
generally
for
farming
except
in
little
small
spots
and
there
is
a
spot
here
and
one
here
where
somebody
add
at
different
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
he
would
have
to
cross
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
they
used
a
boat.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
this
was
a
negro
man
that
went
over
there
and
farmed
for
a
while
and
i
think
the
high
water
came
along
and
wiped
them
out
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir
and
those
days
they
used
the
horse
and
mule
but
now
water
clear
up
something
about
--
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
got
it
over
there
but
they
had
--
they
supposed
to
have
a
mule
and
farmed
over
there
in
1932.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
know
where
they
kept
but
he
stayed
over
on
that
side
of
the
river.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
over
in
this
area
up
here
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
yes
sir.
now,
one
part
i
want
to
get
at
no
one
has
ever
lived
on
this
land.
there
has
been
a
statement
by
my
counsel
or
opposing
counsel
from
arkansas
that
mr.
paget
once
lived
there,
he
did
not.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
oh
yes,
he
was.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
oh
no,
this
mile
from
here
to
here
is
what
i'm
talking
about
and
that's
all
tennessee.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
from
this
side
of
the
river?
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
well,
it's
just
the
width
of
the
river
because
they
lived
on
this
side.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
it
would
be
that
mile
across
the
river
to
this
land.
yes
but
they're
always
in
tennessee.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
no
sir,
i
don't
–-
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
if
that's
why
he
abandoned
it
that
it
was
and
that
the
farming
that
has
been
spasmodic
all
the
time.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
thank
you.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
your
honor
before
i
leave,
if
it's
permissible
with
the
opposing
counsel,
l
would
like
to
leave
this
for
the
courts.
mr.
heard
h.
sutton
i'll
just
let
it
informed.
