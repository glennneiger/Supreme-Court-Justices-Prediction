mr.
charles
h.
resnick
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
which
the
mr.
chief
justice
asked
at
the
beginning
of
my
brother's
argument.
in
the
three
elections,
the
progression
of
voting
was
indeed
more
favorable
to
the
union
in
each
case.
i
don't
know
there
has
any
major
significant
--
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
more
favorable.
the
results
of
the
elections
are
set
out
in
full
at
page
30
of
the
appendix
and
based
on
the
percentage
the
absolute
numbers
of
course
vary
with
the
employment
but
on
the
percentage
state,
it
showed
a
gradual
increase.
we
see
the
issue
--
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
fully
concur
with
that,
your
honor.
we
don't
set
much
though
of
by
the
results
but
to
the
extent
that
it
has
any
impact
that
would
be
it.
we
see
the
issue
somewhat
differently
than
the
deputy
attorney
general.
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
only
to
have
narrow
issue
but
whether
on
the
peculiar
fact
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
discretion
in
authority
vested
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
properly
exercised.
we
don't
seek
any
broad
rule
of
mootness
only
that
the
exercise
was
appropriate
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
raytheon's
conduct
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
or
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
is
not
before
you.
neither
is
the
question
of
whether
raytheon's
pre-election
conduct
did
or
did
not
constitute
unfair
labor
practices.
however,
in
order
to
decide
the
issue
which
is
presented,
some
background
of
how
the
history
of
the
case
appeared
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
essential.
so,
i'd
like
to
go
into
fact
a
little
more
in
detail
than
the
attorney
general.
as
the
record
stood
before
the
court
of
appeals,
raytheon
was
an
employer
of
approximately
40,000
people
with
plants
in
a
number
of
locations
throughout
the
country.
employees
had
a
number
of
plants
including
two
in
california
who
are
represented
by
unions,
and
there
had
never
been
a
strike
by
raytheon
employees.
approximately
19
petitions
for
election
had
been
filed
at
raytheon
plants
during
the
period
between
1960
and
1966.
and
prior
to
the
case
before
you,
no
objections
had
been
filed
to
raytheon
pre-election
conduct
in
any
of
those
and
of
course
no
elections
had
been
set
aside.
on
january
4,
1965,
the
iue
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
for
a
representation
election
to
be
held
in
the
unit
of
production
maintenance
employees
at
raytheon's
mountain
view,
california
plant.
subsequently,
the
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers
expressed
interest
in
the
proceeding
and
then
election
was
agreed
upon
for
february
4,
1965.
on
february
2,
two
days
before
the
election,
robert
hennemuth,
raytheon's
vice-president
industrial
relations
delivered
on
address
to
eight
groups
of
the
employees,
the
speeches
were
substantially
identical
in
conduct
emphasizing
the
importance
of
voting,
explaining
how
the
collective
bargaining
process
works,
making
a
comparison
of
wages
and
fringe
benefits
with
other
raytheon
plants
and
with
other
companies,
and
requesting
employee
support.
in
his
speeches
and
in
response
the
question
for
the
audience,
hennemuth
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
election
was
to
be
a
free
election
and
as
he
put
it,
“the
good
old
american
tradition”.
he
stated
repeatedly
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
promise
any
benefits
or
make
any
threats
or
reprisal.
he
pointed
out
that
in
a
quote
“we
want
to
know,
how
any
of
you
voted
anyway,
so
don't
worry
about
it.”
the
speeches
were
followed
by
question
periods
and
which
anyone
which
hennemuth
attempted
to
answer
employee
inquiries
from
the
floor.
the
questions
and
answers
were
characterized
by
good
nature
at
given
state.
the
transcript
shows
six
and
seven
interruptions
by
laughter
on
a
given
page.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
laughter
from
the
audience.
about
a
week
prior
to
the
election,
a
raytheon
foreman
named,
chris
allegedly
questioned
one
employee
in
the
course
of
discussions
regarding
her
transfer
as
to
why
she
wanted
the
union.
now,
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
the
so-called
chris
alvarado
conversations
formed
the
sole
basis
for
the
board's
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
election
was
duly
held
on
february
4,
two
days
after
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
a
majority
of
employees
voted
neither
union.
the
iue
filed
a
petition
to
set
aside
the
election
in
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
after
hearing
by
the
trial
examiner,
the
boards
set
aside
the
election
and
found
that
raytheon
had
committed
certain
unfair
labor
practices
from
which
it
was
ordered
to
cease-and-desist.
the
board's
findings
were
based
as
i
said
earlier
upon
alleged
improprieties
in
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
upon
the
conversation
between
the
first
line
foreman
and
one
employee.
a
second
election
was
conducted
by
the
board
on
june
23,
1967
as
the
attorney
general
has
said.
it
was
subsequently
set
aside
on
grounds
not
apparent
from
the
record.
on
february
8,
1968,
the
board
petitioned
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
for
enforcement
of
it
unfair
labor
practice
order.
subsequently,
on
november
1,
1968,
while
the
board's
petition
for
enforcement
was
pending,
a
third
election
was
held,
in
which
employees
again
rejected
representation
by
the
iue
and
on
november
12,
the
board's
regional
director
certified
the
results
of
the
third
election.
after
the
board
filed
its
petition
for
enforcement,
the
iue
filed
a
petition
in
the
same
court
to
review
the
portion
of
the
boards
order
dismissing
the
iue's
motion
to
amend
the
complaint.
briefs
on
the
merits
in
the
court
were
filed
on
the
court
of
appeals
by
all
parties.
at
the
oral
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
on
january
7,
the
board
argued
its
petition
for
enforcement
fully
on
the
merits.
the
iue
argued
in
support
of
the
board's
petition
fully
on
the
merits.
following
these
arguments,
raytheon's
counsel
called
the
attention
of
the
court
to
its
prior
decision
in
general
engineering
and
to
the
fact
that
a
certified
election
had
been
held
since
the
filing
towards
the
petition.
he
then
completed
his
argument
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
to
consider
on
the
basis
of
its
earlier
decision
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
raytheon
filed.
memorandum
and
opposition
were
filed
by
the
board
and
by
the
iue
and
appear
in
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
authority
of
the
earlier
decision
in
general
engineering,
granted
raytheon's
motion
and
entered
a
judgment
dismissing
both
the
petition
to
enforce
and
the
iue's
petition
for
review.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
general
engineering
was
decided
1962,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
my
brother
tells
me
that
in
his
research
immediately
prior
to
the
oral
argument,
he
went
on
to
the
general
engineering
case
and
felt
obligated
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
otherwise,
it
probably
would
have
been
handled
in
a
different
manner.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
at
bar
necessarily
requires
a
careful
examination
of
the
decision
in
general
engineering
on
which
it
is
based.
that
case
arose,
on
of
the
petition
by
the
board
for
enforcement
of
a
broad
order,
encompassing
pre-election
conduct,
reinstatement
of
two
unlawfully
discharged
employees
and
reinstatement
of
the
supervisor,
found
to
have
been
discharged
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
court
did
not
dismiss
the
entire
proceeding
as
moot.
on
the
contrary,
it
considered
in
detail
whether
the
discharge
of
the
two
employees
violated
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
whether
the
discharged
of
the
supervisor
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
upon
consideration,
it
granted
in
prior
enforcement
of
the
board's
order.
as
to
the
portion
of
the
order
dealing
with
the
representation
case
only,
the
court
held
that
the
cease-and-desist
order
had
been
mooted
by
issuance
of
the
certification
of
the
results
on
the
election
held
subsequent
to
the
order
on
the
review.
on
these
facts,
the
rule
of
law
could
be
derived
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
from
its
prior
decision
in
general
engineering
is
that
where
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
relates
solely
to
an
election
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
may,
don't
have
to,
may
dismiss
a
petition
for
enforcement
of
an
order
relating
only
to
those
practices.
orders
entered
by
the
board
are
not
self-enforcing
nor
is
the
board
authorized
to
the
levied
fines
or
penalties
for
failure
to
comply.
congress
did
not
grant
this
power.
instead,
section
10
(e)
of
the
act
provides
that
the
board
shall
have
the
power
to
petition
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
enforcement
of
its
order
and
that
the
board
shall
file
a
record
with
the
proceedings
in
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
not
the
board
is
then
given
the
power
to
grant
temporary
relief
and
the
power
to
make
and
enter
a
decree
enforcing,
modifying
and
enforcing
as
so
a
modified
or
setting
aside
in
all
or
in
part
the
order
of
the
board.
congress
had
considered
and
rejected
the
possibility
of
placing
more
enforcement
authority
in
the
board
and
less
on
the
court
of
appeals.
the
study
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
10
(e)
shows
that
such
statute
says
the
packers
and
stock
yards
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
their
mandatory
provisions
for
injunctive
orders
were
considered
before
the
adoption
of
section
10
(e).
instead
of
following
the
provisions
of
those
statutes,
the
draftsman
followed
the
enforcement
provisions
of
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
required
the
board
to
seek
enforcement
from
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
in
turn
were
not
required
to
but
were
given
power
to
enforce.
as
noted
at
page
10
of
raytheon's
brief,
a
specific
amendment
by
the
house
of
representatives
was
adopted
at
a
late
stage
of
the
legislator
proceeding
to
change
the
words
that
since
what
is
now
section
10
(e)
from
“shall
make
and
enter
a
decree,
so
as
to
read
shall
have
the
power
to
make
and
enter
a
decree”.
it
seems
clear
that
congress
intended
the
order,
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
not
as
rubberstamp
for
the
board's
orders
but
to
issue
such
orders
as
the
court
of
appeals
on
evaluation
of
the
case
felt
appropriate.
necessarily
included
within
that
power
was
the
power
to
dismiss
board
petitions.
as
this
court
said
in
hecht
versus
bowles,
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
compliance
orders
are
hardly
suggest
an
absolute
duty
to
do
so
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
the
difference
in
language
alone
would
distinguished
this
case
from
wirtz
versus
glass
blowers
association
cited
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
there,
as
this
court
obtains
to
point
out,
the
labor
management
reporting
in
disclosure
act
of
1969,
left
no
room
for
choice
but
required
that
the
court
shall
declare
the
election
void
and
direct
a
new
election.
the
court
of
appeals
acted
within
the
proper
grounds
--
bounds
of
discretion
in
this
case,
as
its
judgment
discloses,
the
case
had
command
to
be
heard
on
the
transcript
of
the
record
from
the
board.
on
the
basis
of
that
record
and
the
argument
of
counsel,
it
must
have
been
clear
to
the
court
that
it
was
dealing
in
this
least
with
a
deep-rooted,
hardcore
offense.
on
the
contrary,
it
was
dealing
with
inferences
to
be
derived
from
speeches
properly
characterized
by
the
trial
examiner
was
made
in
“without
ranker”,
good
humor
give
and
take
in
a
question
period.
the
court
of
appeals
put
and
did
conclude
that
the
offenses
were
so
superficial
and
so
intertwined
with
the
election
proceeding
that
enforcement
was
not
justified.
now,
the
attorney
general
calls
your
attention
properly
to
your
decision
in
rutter-rex.
the
situation
in
rutter-rex
was
entirely
different.
there
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
an
employer
whom
have
had
already
in
an
earlier
case
ordered
to
comply
with
the
board's
order.
it
was
the
second
time
out
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
to
modify
the
board's
order
with
respect
to
backpay.
the
case
involved
one
of
the
most
serious
offenses
under
the
act
and
unfair
labor
practice
strike
in
the
obligation
to
reinstate
with
backpay.
in
reversing
the
court
below,
this
court
discuss
in
detail
the
nature
of
backpay
orders
and
the
burden
of
whom
--
who
should
bare
the
lost
pay,
the
employee
or
the
employer
notwithstanding
the
board's
delinquency.
i
submit
that
our
case
is
entirely
different.
there
is
no
backpay
order.
only
the
initial
consideration
of
whether
an
order
for
enforcement
should
issue
at
all.
certainly,
this
court
did
not
intend
in
rutter-rex
to
overrule
its
prior
decisions
in
universal
camera
or
in
braunfeld.
there,
the
question
of
the
limitation
of
review
was
thoroughly
discussed
and
it's
clear
that
does
not
mean
the
same
thing
as
no
review.
the
power
to
enforce,
modify
or
set
aside
board
orders
was
given
by
congress
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
no
standard
was
set
or
prescribed
by
congress
as
to
when
it
must
exercise
that
power
and
one
may
decline
to
exercise
such
power.
such
decisions
were
left
into
the
discretion
of
the
courts
of
appeals
subject
of
course
to
review
by
this
court,
but
review
of
what?
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
test
as
was
stated
in
the
pittsburg
steamship
is
not
whether
you
would
make
the
make
the
decision
as
the
court
of
appeals
made
where
the
case
before
you
in
the
first
instance
but
whether
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
constitutes
an
abuse.
abuse
has
not
been
shown
in
this
case,
and
the
judgment
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
policy
arguments
directed
to
the
proposition
that
raytheon
if
not
ordered
to
cease-and-desist
might
engaged
in
further
conduct
of
violating
the
act
substitute
speculation
for
facts.
at
the
time
the
case
was
a
heard,
almost
four
years
had
gone
by
and
no
other
unfair
labor
practices
had
been
charge,
much
less
filed.
why
should
the
court
of
appeals
be
required
to
deal
deeply
into
the
record
to
decide
difficult
questions
of
statutory
interpretation,
constitutional
questions
to
which
they
relate,
when
the
evils
against
which
enforcement
has
sought
do
not
exist?
this
court
has
consistently
stated
that
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
academic
questions,
particularly
those
involve
in
constitutional
issues.
while
the
board
may
contend
that
are
to
seeking
in
order
prevent
unlawful
conduct
in
the
future,
this
case
can
properly
be
moot
when
the
conduct
sought
to
be
enjoined
as
is
conjectural
as
it
is
in
this
case.
cases
cited
by
the
board
from
other
circuits
are
not
at
variance
with
the
position
for
which
we
contend.
those
courts
had
and
exercise
of
their
discretion
to
grant
enforcement
on
substantially
different
facts.
whether
they
or
this
court
might
have
decided
our
case
differently
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
they
have
the
discretion.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit,
which
decided
our
case
has
followed
mexia
as
we
cite
in
our
brief
at
--
can
you
have
the
page
in
--
as
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
25.
the
same
panel
of
judges
which
decided
our
case
which
two
of
them
decided
subsequently
the
repeated
case,
in
which
way
they
like
you
to
follow
mexia.
so,
it
has
not
automatically
elected
to
move
every
case
which
has
there
has
been
subsequent
election
of
compliance.

no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
enforcement
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
supposed
the
order
would
nonetheless
stand.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
we
don't
view
this
as
the
is
the
classical
case
of
mootness,
your
honor,
but
only
as
mootness
being
in
a
shorthand
term
here
for
the
court
deciding
that
the
case
was
so
little
remaining
significance
that
that
the
petition
to
be
dismiss.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
it
was
not
reversed,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
your
honor,
i
feel
very
strongly
and
we
argue
that
positions
strenuously
to
the
court
of
appeals
below.
we
didn't
feel
that
that
issue
was
before
you
hear
but
only
the
question
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
properly
exercised
its
discretion
but
in
this
case
we
think
it
quite
remained
that
the
first
amendment
issue
certainly
would
had
had
to
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
could
take
that
into
account
when
determining
whether
there
was
enough
to
this
case
to
justify
such
a
consideration.
we
seek
no
broad
rule
of
law
mooting
every
case
in
which
a
certified
election
is
held.
indeed
we
are
sure
that
is
not
the
law.
we
seek
only
the
concurrence
of
this
court
in
the
proposition
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
facts
of
how
our
particular
case
had
and
did
not
abuse
the
discretion
to
dismiss
the
board's
enforcement
petition.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
which
the
mr.
chief
justice
asked
at
the
beginning
of
my
brother's
argument.
in
the
three
elections,
the
progression
of
voting
was
indeed
more
favorable
to
the
union
in
each
case.
i
don't
know
there
has
any
major
significant
--
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
more
favorable.
the
results
of
the
elections
are
set
out
in
full
at
page
30
of
the
appendix
and
based
on
the
percentage
the
absolute
numbers
of
course
vary
with
the
employment
but
on
the
percentage
state,
it
showed
a
gradual
increase.
we
see
the
issue
--
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
fully
concur
with
that,
your
honor.
we
don't
set
much
though
of
by
the
results
but
to
the
extent
that
it
has
any
impact
that
would
be
it.
we
see
the
issue
somewhat
differently
than
the
deputy
attorney
general.
this
court
is
asked
to
decide
only
to
have
narrow
issue
but
whether
on
the
peculiar
fact
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
discretion
in
authority
vested
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
properly
exercised.
we
don't
seek
any
broad
rule
of
mootness
only
that
the
exercise
was
appropriate
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
raytheon's
conduct
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
or
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
is
not
before
you.
neither
is
the
question
of
whether
raytheon's
pre-election
conduct
did
or
did
not
constitute
unfair
labor
practices.
however,
in
order
to
decide
the
issue
which
is
presented,
some
background
of
how
the
history
of
the
case
appeared
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
essential.
so,
i'd
like
to
go
into
fact
a
little
more
in
detail
than
the
attorney
general.
as
the
record
stood
before
the
court
of
appeals,
raytheon
was
an
employer
of
approximately
40,000
people
with
plants
in
a
number
of
locations
throughout
the
country.
employees
had
a
number
of
plants
including
two
in
california
who
are
represented
by
unions,
and
there
had
never
been
a
strike
by
raytheon
employees.
approximately
19
petitions
for
election
had
been
filed
at
raytheon
plants
during
the
period
between
1960
and
1966.
and
prior
to
the
case
before
you,
no
objections
had
been
filed
to
raytheon
pre-election
conduct
in
any
of
those
and
of
course
no
elections
had
been
set
aside.
on
january
4,
1965,
the
iue
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
for
a
representation
election
to
be
held
in
the
unit
of
production
maintenance
employees
at
raytheon's
mountain
view,
california
plant.
subsequently,
the
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers
expressed
interest
in
the
proceeding
and
then
election
was
agreed
upon
for
february
4,
1965.
on
february
2,
two
days
before
the
election,
robert
hennemuth,
raytheon's
vice-president
industrial
relations
delivered
on
address
to
eight
groups
of
the
employees,
the
speeches
were
substantially
identical
in
conduct
emphasizing
the
importance
of
voting,
explaining
how
the
collective
bargaining
process
works,
making
a
comparison
of
wages
and
fringe
benefits
with
other
raytheon
plants
and
with
other
companies,
and
requesting
employee
support.
in
his
speeches
and
in
response
the
question
for
the
audience,
hennemuth
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
election
was
to
be
a
free
election
and
as
he
put
it,
“the
good
old
american
tradition”.
he
stated
repeatedly
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
promise
any
benefits
or
make
any
threats
or
reprisal.
he
pointed
out
that
in
a
quote
“we
want
to
know,
how
any
of
you
voted
anyway,
so
don't
worry
about
it.”
the
speeches
were
followed
by
question
periods
and
which
anyone
which
hennemuth
attempted
to
answer
employee
inquiries
from
the
floor.
the
questions
and
answers
were
characterized
by
good
nature
at
given
state.
the
transcript
shows
six
and
seven
interruptions
by
laughter
on
a
given
page.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
laughter
from
the
audience.
about
a
week
prior
to
the
election,
a
raytheon
foreman
named,
chris
allegedly
questioned
one
employee
in
the
course
of
discussions
regarding
her
transfer
as
to
why
she
wanted
the
union.
now,
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
the
so-called
chris
alvarado
conversations
formed
the
sole
basis
for
the
board's
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
election
was
duly
held
on
february
4,
two
days
after
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
a
majority
of
employees
voted
neither
union.
the
iue
filed
a
petition
to
set
aside
the
election
in
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
after
hearing
by
the
trial
examiner,
the
boards
set
aside
the
election
and
found
that
raytheon
had
committed
certain
unfair
labor
practices
from
which
it
was
ordered
to
cease-and-desist.
the
board's
findings
were
based
as
i
said
earlier
upon
alleged
improprieties
in
the
hennemuth
speeches
and
upon
the
conversation
between
the
first
line
foreman
and
one
employee.
a
second
election
was
conducted
by
the
board
on
june
23,
1967
as
the
attorney
general
has
said.
it
was
subsequently
set
aside
on
grounds
not
apparent
from
the
record.
on
february
8,
1968,
the
board
petitioned
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
for
enforcement
of
it
unfair
labor
practice
order.
subsequently,
on
november
1,
1968,
while
the
board's
petition
for
enforcement
was
pending,
a
third
election
was
held,
in
which
employees
again
rejected
representation
by
the
iue
and
on
november
12,
the
board's
regional
director
certified
the
results
of
the
third
election.
after
the
board
filed
its
petition
for
enforcement,
the
iue
filed
a
petition
in
the
same
court
to
review
the
portion
of
the
boards
order
dismissing
the
iue's
motion
to
amend
the
complaint.
briefs
on
the
merits
in
the
court
were
filed
on
the
court
of
appeals
by
all
parties.
at
the
oral
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
on
january
7,
the
board
argued
its
petition
for
enforcement
fully
on
the
merits.
the
iue
argued
in
support
of
the
board's
petition
fully
on
the
merits.
following
these
arguments,
raytheon's
counsel
called
the
attention
of
the
court
to
its
prior
decision
in
general
engineering
and
to
the
fact
that
a
certified
election
had
been
held
since
the
filing
towards
the
petition.
he
then
completed
his
argument
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
to
consider
on
the
basis
of
its
earlier
decision
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
raytheon
filed.
memorandum
and
opposition
were
filed
by
the
board
and
by
the
iue
and
appear
in
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
authority
of
the
earlier
decision
in
general
engineering,
granted
raytheon's
motion
and
entered
a
judgment
dismissing
both
the
petition
to
enforce
and
the
iue's
petition
for
review.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
general
engineering
was
decided
1962,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
my
brother
tells
me
that
in
his
research
immediately
prior
to
the
oral
argument,
he
went
on
to
the
general
engineering
case
and
felt
obligated
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
otherwise,
it
probably
would
have
been
handled
in
a
different
manner.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
at
bar
necessarily
requires
a
careful
examination
of
the
decision
in
general
engineering
on
which
it
is
based.
that
case
arose,
on
of
the
petition
by
the
board
for
enforcement
of
a
broad
order,
encompassing
pre-election
conduct,
reinstatement
of
two
unlawfully
discharged
employees
and
reinstatement
of
the
supervisor,
found
to
have
been
discharged
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
the
court
did
not
dismiss
the
entire
proceeding
as
moot.
on
the
contrary,
it
considered
in
detail
whether
the
discharge
of
the
two
employees
violated
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
whether
the
discharged
of
the
supervisor
violated
section
8
(a)
(1).
upon
consideration,
it
granted
in
prior
enforcement
of
the
board's
order.
as
to
the
portion
of
the
order
dealing
with
the
representation
case
only,
the
court
held
that
the
cease-and-desist
order
had
been
mooted
by
issuance
of
the
certification
of
the
results
on
the
election
held
subsequent
to
the
order
on
the
review.
on
these
facts,
the
rule
of
law
could
be
derived
from
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
from
its
prior
decision
in
general
engineering
is
that
where
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
relates
solely
to
an
election
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
may,
don't
have
to,
may
dismiss
a
petition
for
enforcement
of
an
order
relating
only
to
those
practices.
orders
entered
by
the
board
are
not
self-enforcing
nor
is
the
board
authorized
to
the
levied
fines
or
penalties
for
failure
to
comply.
congress
did
not
grant
this
power.
instead,
section
10
(e)
of
the
act
provides
that
the
board
shall
have
the
power
to
petition
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
enforcement
of
its
order
and
that
the
board
shall
file
a
record
with
the
proceedings
in
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
not
the
board
is
then
given
the
power
to
grant
temporary
relief
and
the
power
to
make
and
enter
a
decree
enforcing,
modifying
and
enforcing
as
so
a
modified
or
setting
aside
in
all
or
in
part
the
order
of
the
board.
congress
had
considered
and
rejected
the
possibility
of
placing
more
enforcement
authority
in
the
board
and
less
on
the
court
of
appeals.
the
study
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
10
(e)
shows
that
such
statute
says
the
packers
and
stock
yards
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
their
mandatory
provisions
for
injunctive
orders
were
considered
before
the
adoption
of
section
10
(e).
instead
of
following
the
provisions
of
those
statutes,
the
draftsman
followed
the
enforcement
provisions
of
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
required
the
board
to
seek
enforcement
from
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
in
turn
were
not
required
to
but
were
given
power
to
enforce.
as
noted
at
page
10
of
raytheon's
brief,
a
specific
amendment
by
the
house
of
representatives
was
adopted
at
a
late
stage
of
the
legislator
proceeding
to
change
the
words
that
since
what
is
now
section
10
(e)
from
“shall
make
and
enter
a
decree,
so
as
to
read
shall
have
the
power
to
make
and
enter
a
decree”.
it
seems
clear
that
congress
intended
the
order,
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
not
as
rubberstamp
for
the
board's
orders
but
to
issue
such
orders
as
the
court
of
appeals
on
evaluation
of
the
case
felt
appropriate.
necessarily
included
within
that
power
was
the
power
to
dismiss
board
petitions.
as
this
court
said
in
hecht
versus
bowles,
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
compliance
orders
are
hardly
suggest
an
absolute
duty
to
do
so
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
the
difference
in
language
alone
would
distinguished
this
case
from
wirtz
versus
glass
blowers
association
cited
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
there,
as
this
court
obtains
to
point
out,
the
labor
management
reporting
in
disclosure
act
of
1969,
left
no
room
for
choice
but
required
that
the
court
shall
declare
the
election
void
and
direct
a
new
election.
the
court
of
appeals
acted
within
the
proper
grounds
--
bounds
of
discretion
in
this
case,
as
its
judgment
discloses,
the
case
had
command
to
be
heard
on
the
transcript
of
the
record
from
the
board.
on
the
basis
of
that
record
and
the
argument
of
counsel,
it
must
have
been
clear
to
the
court
that
it
was
dealing
in
this
least
with
a
deep-rooted,
hardcore
offense.
on
the
contrary,
it
was
dealing
with
inferences
to
be
derived
from
speeches
properly
characterized
by
the
trial
examiner
was
made
in
“without
ranker”,
good
humor
give
and
take
in
a
question
period.
the
court
of
appeals
put
and
did
conclude
that
the
offenses
were
so
superficial
and
so
intertwined
with
the
election
proceeding
that
enforcement
was
not
justified.
now,
the
attorney
general
calls
your
attention
properly
to
your
decision
in
rutter-rex.
the
situation
in
rutter-rex
was
entirely
different.
there
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
an
employer
whom
have
had
already
in
an
earlier
case
ordered
to
comply
with
the
board's
order.
it
was
the
second
time
out
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
to
modify
the
board's
order
with
respect
to
backpay.
the
case
involved
one
of
the
most
serious
offenses
under
the
act
and
unfair
labor
practice
strike
in
the
obligation
to
reinstate
with
backpay.
in
reversing
the
court
below,
this
court
discuss
in
detail
the
nature
of
backpay
orders
and
the
burden
of
whom
--
who
should
bare
the
lost
pay,
the
employee
or
the
employer
notwithstanding
the
board's
delinquency.
i
submit
that
our
case
is
entirely
different.
there
is
no
backpay
order.
only
the
initial
consideration
of
whether
an
order
for
enforcement
should
issue
at
all.
certainly,
this
court
did
not
intend
in
rutter-rex
to
overrule
its
prior
decisions
in
universal
camera
or
in
braunfeld.
there,
the
question
of
the
limitation
of
review
was
thoroughly
discussed
and
it's
clear
that
does
not
mean
the
same
thing
as
no
review.
the
power
to
enforce,
modify
or
set
aside
board
orders
was
given
by
congress
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
no
standard
was
set
or
prescribed
by
congress
as
to
when
it
must
exercise
that
power
and
one
may
decline
to
exercise
such
power.
such
decisions
were
left
into
the
discretion
of
the
courts
of
appeals
subject
of
course
to
review
by
this
court,
but
review
of
what?
whether
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
test
as
was
stated
in
the
pittsburg
steamship
is
not
whether
you
would
make
the
make
the
decision
as
the
court
of
appeals
made
where
the
case
before
you
in
the
first
instance
but
whether
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
constitutes
an
abuse.
abuse
has
not
been
shown
in
this
case,
and
the
judgment
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
policy
arguments
directed
to
the
proposition
that
raytheon
if
not
ordered
to
cease-and-desist
might
engaged
in
further
conduct
of
violating
the
act
substitute
speculation
for
facts.
at
the
time
the
case
was
a
heard,
almost
four
years
had
gone
by
and
no
other
unfair
labor
practices
had
been
charge,
much
less
filed.
why
should
the
court
of
appeals
be
required
to
deal
deeply
into
the
record
to
decide
difficult
questions
of
statutory
interpretation,
constitutional
questions
to
which
they
relate,
when
the
evils
against
which
enforcement
has
sought
do
not
exist?
this
court
has
consistently
stated
that
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
academic
questions,
particularly
those
involve
in
constitutional
issues.
while
the
board
may
contend
that
are
to
seeking
in
order
prevent
unlawful
conduct
in
the
future,
this
case
can
properly
be
moot
when
the
conduct
sought
to
be
enjoined
as
is
conjectural
as
it
is
in
this
case.
cases
cited
by
the
board
from
other
circuits
are
not
at
variance
with
the
position
for
which
we
contend.
those
courts
had
and
exercise
of
their
discretion
to
grant
enforcement
on
substantially
different
facts.
whether
they
or
this
court
might
have
decided
our
case
differently
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
they
have
the
discretion.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit,
which
decided
our
case
has
followed
mexia
as
we
cite
in
our
brief
at
--
can
you
have
the
page
in
--
as
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
25.
the
same
panel
of
judges
which
decided
our
case
which
two
of
them
decided
subsequently
the
repeated
case,
in
which
way
they
like
you
to
follow
mexia.
so,
it
has
not
automatically
elected
to
move
every
case
which
has
there
has
been
subsequent
election
of
compliance.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
enforcement
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
supposed
the
order
would
nonetheless
stand.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
we
don't
view
this
as
the
is
the
classical
case
of
mootness,
your
honor,
but
only
as
mootness
being
in
a
shorthand
term
here
for
the
court
deciding
that
the
case
was
so
little
remaining
significance
that
that
the
petition
to
be
dismiss.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
it
was
not
reversed,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
resnick
your
honor,
i
feel
very
strongly
and
we
argue
that
positions
strenuously
to
the
court
of
appeals
below.
we
didn't
feel
that
that
issue
was
before
you
hear
but
only
the
question
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
properly
exercised
its
discretion
but
in
this
case
we
think
it
quite
remained
that
the
first
amendment
issue
certainly
would
had
had
to
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
could
take
that
into
account
when
determining
whether
there
was
enough
to
this
case
to
justify
such
a
consideration.
we
seek
no
broad
rule
of
law
mooting
every
case
in
which
a
certified
election
is
held.
indeed
we
are
sure
that
is
not
the
law.
we
seek
only
the
concurrence
of
this
court
in
the
proposition
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
facts
of
how
our
particular
case
had
and
did
not
abuse
the
discretion
to
dismiss
the
board's
enforcement
petition.
thank
you.
