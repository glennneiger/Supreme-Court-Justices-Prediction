mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court
please.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
this
case
comes
of
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
a
specific
but
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
a
very
important
issue
as
to
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
presents
the
precise
question
of
whether
on
the
eve
up
or
at
other
about
the
time
of
a
representation
of
election
under
the
act.
the
employer
engages
in
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
whether
such
unfair
labor
practice
activity
is
rendered
moot
and
therefore
now
susceptible
to
an
enforcing
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
by
virtue
of
a
subsequent
representation
election
which
the
union
lost
that
came
after
the
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
the
facts
in
the
case,
i
think
are
likewise
rather
direct
and
not
controversial.
the
union
in
the
case
began
its
organizational
activities
among
the
employees
in
the
fall
of
1964
on
the
eve
of
the
representation
election
a
few
days
before
representatives
of
the
company
engaged
in
conduct
which
subsequently
as
i
will
outline
was
determined
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
and
election
was
held,
the
union
lost
the
election.
the
union
petition
to
have
the
election
set
aside
and
at
the
same
time,
filed
unfair
labor
practice,
filed
a
complaint
with
the
board
and
the
charge
with
the
board,
and
the
board
subsequently
filed
this
complaint.
thereafter,
the
board
heard
the
evidence
with
the
respect
to
alleged
unfair
labor
practice
activity
and
issued
its
order
against
the
employer
to
the
cease-and-desist
in
the
conduct.
following
the
order
of
the
board,
a
second
election
was
held.
again,
which
the
union
lost,
and
that
election
was
set
aside
for
reasons
that
are
not
material
here
and
do
not
appear
in
this
record.
after
the
second
election,
the
board
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
for
an
order
in
forcing
its
order
against
the
respondent
company.
and
after
that
petition
to
the
court
of
appeals,
a
third
election
was
held.
and
again,
the
union
lost
the
election
but
at
this
time,
there
was
no
objections
filed
by
the
union
or
the
employees
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
election,
and
the
board
certified
the
election
as
be
invalid.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
believe
my
recollection
of
record
is
that
the
union's
votes
decreased.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yeah,
that
the
union's
position
became
stronger
in
the
situation
that
i
--
it's
in
the
record
here
but
that's
my
recollection
of
it.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
material
one
way
or
another
to
the
determination
of
this
issue,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
that
could
possibly
be
it
but
i
think
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
possibly
but
there's
so
many
other
factors
that
could
occur,
turnover
employees,
other
conduct
the
issues
raised
in
the
election.
i
would
say
that
you
almost
have
to
have
precise
evidence
so
the
point
like
that
mr.
chief
justice
before
that
would
be
a
supportable
inference
all
by
itself
from
just
a
mere
of
fact
if
the
votes
went
up
or
down,
one
way
or
another.
now,
that
would
be
my
opinion
in
this
regard.
when
the
case
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
no,
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
inference
can
be
gained
from
this
record
as
to
the
fact
that
it
was
set
aside.
there's
nothing
with
the
record,
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
the
government
to
suggest
inferentially
or
otherwise
or
that
that
second
election
was
set
aside
as
a
result
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
company,
and
the
record
doesn't
show
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
don't
want
to
infer
that
it
was
a
continuation
as
an
improper
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
in
the
part
of
the
company.
now,
when
the
matter
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit,
the
respondent
company
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
a
valid
subsequent
election
that
been
held
and
asked
the
court
to
dismiss
all
of
the
proceedings
involved
in
the
matter,
and
asked
it
to
rely
from
its
decision
in
the
general
engineering
case
of
1962.
the
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision
did
deny
the
respondent
company's
motion
to
dismiss
all
the
proceedings.
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
point
out
here
that
they
did
not
determine
on
the
merits
when
it
had
before
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
based
upon
the
record
considered
as
a
whole
and
the
law
of
whether
in
fact
the
respondent
company
was
guilty
of
committing
the
unfair
labor
practices.
they
just
saw
the
whole
--
through
the
whole
thing
out
on
the
grounds
that
the
matter
had
become
loop
and
no
longer
been
an
import
as
a
result
of
the
third
subsequent
valid
election.
the
board
petitioned
for
a
certiorari
raising
three
fundamental
questions.
one,
it
present
a
very
clear
precise
conflict
between
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
one
hand
of
the
second,
fourth
and
seventh
circuits
and
almost
identical
cases.
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
raytheon,
this
case
and
general
engineering
conflicts
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
with
very
clearly
enunciated
opinions
of
this
court
dealing
generally
and
broadly
in
this
field.
and
then
finally,
it
presented
a
good
question
of
policy
with
respect
to
the
effectuation
of
the
policies
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
respondent's
argument
in
the
case
seems
to
be
essentially
predicated
upon
the
statement
that
since
section
10
(e)
of
the
act,
confers
upon
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
that
discretion
is
a
broad
one
and
that
the
court
below
properly
exercised
this
broad
discretion
in
dismissing
this
case
on
the
grounds
of
mootness.
now,
as
preface
to
my
argument
and
if
the
court
will
grant
me
permission,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
case
that
was
not
cited
in
the
government's
brief
nor
in
briefs
filed
by
the
respondent
company.
i
called
mr.
resnick
monday
when
they
case
change
of
my
attention
and
indicated
my
desire
to
do
so,
and
i
believe
that
he
would
say
without
objection
that
i
made.
the
reason
why
it
was
not
cited,
it's
a
decision
of
mr.
justice
marshall
which
was
written
on
december
15th
of
this
term
of
the
court
and
it
was
handed
down
after
the
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
government
were
filed.
and
that's
your
case
nrlb
versus
rutter-rex.
the
reason
why
we
file
it
is
that
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
very
clearly
and
concisely
set
what
it
had
set
before
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
remedial
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
are
broad.
it's
a
broad
discretionary
power
and
they
are
subject
to
but
limited
review.
and
i
think
that
this
case
--
this
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
is
practically
dispositive
of
the
argument
of
the
respondent
company
here.
because
the
only
way
the
respondent
company
can
get
to
this
point
is
to
say
that
section
10
(e)
confers
upon
the
court
of
appeals.
they
brought
very
broad
discretionary
power
in
their
review
boarders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
best
example
of
that,
i
think
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
national
labor
relations
board
versus
mexia
textile
which
was
handed
down
by
this
court
in
1949.
in
that
case,
the
issue
was
whether
not
the
board
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
enforce
its
order,
even
if
the
respondent
employer
had
voluntarily
complied
with
the
order
of
the
board.
and
the
issue
was
raised
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
there's
no
reason
for
you
to
consider
this
matter
any
longer.
the
board
said
that
we
engaged
in
illegal
activity
in
conduct,
we
agreed
with
it,
we
have
complied
with
it,
so
why
haven't
order
the
board
enforcing
conduct
that
we've
already
complied
with
or
corrected.
the
supreme
court
and
this
court,
i
think
correctly
held
that
since
this
kind
of
conduct
can't
be
continuing
in
nature,
the
merely
showing
of
compliance
and
voluntary
or
not
by
the
employer
with
it
and
anyone
given
point
of
time,
should
not
be
a
bar
to
the
board's
right
to
get
an
enforcement
order,
so
that
it
would
have
available
to
it,
a
contempt
citation
and
order
in
the
event
the
employer
came
along
subsequent
to
its
voluntary
compliance
and
engaged
in
similar
conduct.
i
think
also
whether
the
decision
to
court
which
go
to
the
whole
question
of
mootness
bring
to
bare
the
essential
problem
that's
involved
in
this
case.
as
this
court
has
held
and
in
the
united
states
versus
w.t.
grant
company,
you
should
not
dismiss
a
case
on
the
grounds
of
mootness
until
only
there's
reasonable
expectation
that
there
will
never
be
a
reoccurrence
of
the
wrong
again,
that
there's
a
strong
burden
imposed
upon
the
wrong
doer
to
come
forward
and
show
that
regardless
of
our
intent
or
the
circumstances
that
it's
likely
that
the
conduct
would
never
occur
again.
and
i
think
again
as
this
court
has
held
in
walling
versus
reuter,
this
is
true,
so
that
the
courts
or
the
administrative
boards
and
agencies
can
always
have
in
its
hit
pockets
so
to
speak
the
arrow
to
its
bow
of
a
contempt
citation
issued
by
a
court
in
the
event
the
wrong
doer
commits
the
wrong
again.
and
then
finally
of
course
just
from
the
stand
point
of
public
policy
in
the
administration
of
the
act
and
i
think
at
this
point
that
court
should
be
primarily
concerned
about
because
if
you
take
the
respondents
argument
that
at
first
blush,
he
would
make
the
court
believe
either
way
that
there
is
something
integral
and
indigenous
about
section
8
of
the
act
leading
with
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
to
the
one
end
and
section
9
of
the
act
which
deals
with
representation
elections.
section
7
of
the
act
guarantees
to
employees
the
right
to
engage
in
the
concern
of
the
activities
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection,
and
i
think
that
this
guarantee
of
section
7
of
the
act
encompasses
several
portions
of
the
balance
of
the
act.
one
of
them
of
course
is
the
representation
election.
employees
under
this
act
have
a
right
to
a
free
environment,
the
board
has
set,
i
think
many
times
that
ask
ideally
under
the
laboratory
conditions
that
the
board
would
like
to
see
exist,
to
organize
among
themselves,
to
designate
a
union
as
their
collective
bargaining
agent,
to
have
representation
election
whereby
such
a
bargain
agent
can
be
certified.
but
this
right
that
is
conferred
upon
employees
in
terms
to
self-organization
is
a
distinct
separate
right
under
the
act
in
terms
of
its
policies
then
the
provisions
that
are
contained
in
section
8
of
the
act
that
deal
with
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
have
section
8
of
the
act
is
to
give
the
board
and
the
courts
a
machinery
by
which
you
can
create
these
so-called
laboratory
conditions,
so
that
employees
can
make
a
free
choice
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
their
collective
bargain
agent,
and
for
the
employer
to
come
along
as
the
respondent
company
has
in
this
case
to
say
the
we'll
really,
they've
had
two
or
three
shots
to
this
election
and
they've
lost
it.
and
what
we
might
have
done
with
respect
to
the
first
one
and
it
should
be
rendered
moot,
i
think
begs
the
question
because
all
you
have
to
do
then
is
to
permit
employers
to
engaged
in
this
kind
of
conduct
and
the
union
could
have
three
or
four,
or
five,
or
six
elections
and
the
courts
would
never
really
have
a
means
by
which
to
stop
the
yearly
go
activity
in
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes,
either
jones
&
laughlin
steel
case
of
1936.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
really
went
into
that
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
don't
believe
they
applied
in
a
standard
at
all,
if
they
been
aware
of
the
mexia
case
of
this
court
when
it
came
down
with
the
general
engineering
case
in
1962,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
ever
arrived
at
that
result.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
in
my
opinion,
what
should
be
done
is
to
vacate
the
act
of
the
court
of
appeals,
send
it
back
to
it,
have
it
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
merits
and
the
record
consider
just
a
whole
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
then
get
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
wouldn't
expect
it
to
do
but
i
came
forth
with
an
erroneous
application
of
the
law
or
exercise
of
its
discretionary
power,
you'd
have
something
before
this
court
of
some
substance
in
merit.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well
mr.
justice
white,
that
raise
is
a
good
point
because
not
all
conduct
that
the
board
looks
that
as
being
improper
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
election
constitutes
with
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
--
like
the
24-hour
rule
for
instance.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
respondent
company
neglected
to
point
out
the
fact
that
of
the
three
forms
of
every
illegal
conduct
in
this
case
that
is
to
say
interrogated
in
the
employee
and
the
illegal
speech
that
this
company
also
initiated
a
new
grievance
procedure
which
the
board
held
was
unfair
labor
practice
conduct.
this
new
grievance
procedure
is
a
continuing
procedure
presumably
although
the
record
doesn't
show,
it
exists
today,
so
that
as
the
case
as
all
the
courts
held
in
second,
fourth,
and
seventh
circuits
these
unions
might
want
to
come
back
at
some
other
time
to
attempt
to
organize
the
employees,
they
have
the
right
indeed
in
this
case
the
inference
is
strong
if
they
would
want
to
because
they
tried
it
three
times
already.
and
if
you
had
in
the
environmental
factors
that
exist
at
this
particular
plan,
conduct
of
a
continuing
nature
which
the
board
is
said,
is
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
in
violation
of
section
881
and
section
7
of
the
act,
then
i
think
in
terms
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
these
employees
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
decide
the
choice
of
their
collective
bargaining
representative
and
in
free
environment
and
that's
the
essential
policy
of
the
act
that's
involved
here,
is
to
be
sure
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
being
given
the
weapon
that
the
statute
contemplated
that
is
to
say
a
contempt
citation
from
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
so
that
employers
will
restrained
from
engaging
in
a
continuing
form
of
conduct
in
order
that
at
least
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
act,
employees
will
be
able
to
choose
their
collective
bargaining
agent
in
the
environment
free
of
contort
and
coercion
or
inducements,
or
benefits,
threats
are
promises.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
to
quote
from
your
recent
decision.
i
believe
that
you
dissented
this
decision
but
the
majority
of
court
said
this
in
the
rutter-rex
case
that
i
mentioned
first.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
this
court
stated
in
there
that
the
remedial
power
of
the
board
is
a
broad
discretionary
one
subject
to
limited
judicial
review
and
let
me
just
indicate
the
facts
of
that
case,
that
was
a
backpay
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
going
to
cut
off
part
of
that
backpay
award
because
the
board
then
there
like
in
this
duty
the
properly
process
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
appropriately
planned
out
of
this
act
is
for
the
benefit
of
employees,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
board
or
an
employer
with
respect
to
the
backpay
orders.
but
that
was
backpay
order.
what
this
company,
this
respondent
company,
wants
you
to
do
is
to
completely
eliminate
a
section
8
limited
the
act
because
of
the
intervention
of
a
section
9
proceeding.
and
if
you
ever
got
down
to
the
point,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
administration
of
this
law
where
an
employer
or
a
union
because
it
now
applies
in
terms
of
this
illegal
activity
to
vote,
if
they
can
ever
excuse
their
unfair
labor
practice
activity
because
they
were
involved
in
a
representation
election,
then
i
think
you're
in
an
area
where
congress
itself
should
go
back
and
reexamine
the
whole
thing
from
a
standpoint
of
policy
as
to
what
the
act
was
supposed
to
do.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
think
it
pretty
well
pleases
itself,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
these
orders
usually
provide
is
that
the
employer
will
post
a
notice
for
60
days.
after
that
they
can
take
them
down,
and
then
the
conduct
that
is
usually
described
by
a
board
order
is
usually
pretty
precise
relating
to
specific
events,
times
and
circumstances
and
as
time
goes
by,
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
difficult
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
try
to
artificially
extend
other
conduct
under
a
contempt
citation.
as
you
know
the
courts
are
very
reluctant
to
the
exercise
their
power,
their
discretion,
in
contempt
situations
and
in
the
years
of
practice
that
i
had
in
this
area,
i
can
never
recall
a
contempt
case
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
claimed
that
they
exercised
that
authority
without
regard
to
the
specific
conduct
that
was
subject
to
the
board's
order.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
more
than
just
a
couple
of
minutes
as
the
chief
justice
please.
i'd
like
to
begin
at
the
end
and
respond
to
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice.
section
8
(c)
of
the
act,
confers
upon
employers
and
employees
free
speech
right,
and
there
is
a
means
by
which
that
you
could
determine
whether
or
not
your
first
amendment
rights
under
the
constitution
had
been
adequately
protected
under
that
section.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
respondent
company
here
can
pull
itself
up
by
its
bootstraps
with
respect
to
the
position
it
takes
in
this
case
because
although
i
was
not
present
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals,
i've
argued
several
such
cases.
i
don't
know
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
what
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
thinking
about
but
i
do
know
what
the
record
says.
with
respect
to
this
whole
question
of
mootness,
and
it
says
this
on
page
48
of
the
appendix,
and
it's
a
per
curiam
statement
by
the
three
judges,
during
oral
argument
in
this
court,
counsel
for
raytheon
made
a
suggestion
of
mootness,
and
the
court
grant
them
lead
to
file
a
motion,
and
then
the
court
said
accordingly
on
the
authority
of
general
engineering
inc.,
raytheon's
motions
are
granted
and
that
proceedings
are
dismissed.
in
general
engineering
inc.,
it
goes
off
solely
on
the
question
of
mootness.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
the
question
well,
how
long
is
this
general
engineering
case
been
around.
it
was
decided
in
1962,
mr.
justice
but
in
1963,
the
seventh
circuit,
and
in
1956,
the
fourth
circuit
being
aware
of
the
general
engineering
case,
refused
to
follow
it
and
followed
a
different
result
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
relied
upon
this
second
circuit
decision
in
clark
brothers
in
1947,
and
i
honestly
believe
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
had
before
it
the
mexia
textile
case
and
the
clark
brothers
case
are
they
would
never
arrive
at
the
result
that
they
did
in
general
election.
with
respect
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
on
what
happened
when
you
declared
moot,
what
you
have
is
a
naked
ineffectual
statement
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
an
employer
is
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
but
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
and
i
think
that
that
would
further
complicate
the
situation
because
you
would
again
have
the
total
environment
be
clouded
by
a
statement
by
national
labor
relations
board
that
this
company
didn't
engaged
in
illegal
conduct
and
yet
if
in
fact
it
had,
there
couldn't
be
an
order
of
the
court
to
make
them
cut
it
out
and
if
that
happened,
i
think
the
company
would
be
under
the
burden
always
and
be
accused
of
this
type
of
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes,
it
would.
i
think,
what
it
would
do
instead
mr.
chief
justice
would
run
right
up
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
you
gave
us
an
order,
an
order
these
people
not
to
do
this
and
now
that
they've
done
it
and
we
want
you
now
to
hold
them
guilty
of
contempt.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
that
might
have
some
impact
on
the
board's
decision
and
than
you
get
into
problems
of
whether
or
not
improper
inferences
or
illegal
influences
were
drawn
as
the
result
of
prior
conduct.
i
think
the
best
way
to
clean
the
case
up
really
and
get
rid
of
this
principle
of
law
that
inadvertently
came
on
ninth
circuit
and
doesn't
square
itself
with
the
policy
of
this
court
whether
the
decision
of
other
circuits
is
to
send
it
back
there
and
ask
them
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
this
company
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
activity,
if
the
they
didn't,
then
dismiss
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle,
and
if
they
did,
they
may
come
susceptible
to
contempt
citation.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
if
you
interpreted
my
remarks
of
saying
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
misunderstood
me.
i
said
that
there
is
conceivably
some
facts
situation
where
they
could.
i
don't
believe
they
exist
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
and
if
you
got
that
impression
from
my
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
can
take
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
oh,
i
agree
with
you
that,
mr.
justice
white
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
that
kind
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
right.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
i
think
this
court
has
applied
the
standard
generally,
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
has
misapplied
it.
i
don't
believe
that
this
record
shows
that
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
under
any
circumstances
that
this
kind
(voice
overlap)
had
occurred.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
fully
agree
to
that.
i
just
think
it
did
on
the
wrong
standard,
your
honor.
i
fully
agree
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court
please.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
this
case
comes
of
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
a
specific
but
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
a
very
important
issue
as
to
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
presents
the
precise
question
of
whether
on
the
eve
up
or
at
other
about
the
time
of
a
representation
of
election
under
the
act.
the
employer
engages
in
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
whether
such
unfair
labor
practice
activity
is
rendered
moot
and
therefore
now
susceptible
to
an
enforcing
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
by
virtue
of
a
subsequent
representation
election
which
the
union
lost
that
came
after
the
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
the
facts
in
the
case,
i
think
are
likewise
rather
direct
and
not
controversial.
the
union
in
the
case
began
its
organizational
activities
among
the
employees
in
the
fall
of
1964
on
the
eve
of
the
representation
election
a
few
days
before
representatives
of
the
company
engaged
in
conduct
which
subsequently
as
i
will
outline
was
determined
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
and
election
was
held,
the
union
lost
the
election.
the
union
petition
to
have
the
election
set
aside
and
at
the
same
time,
filed
unfair
labor
practice,
filed
a
complaint
with
the
board
and
the
charge
with
the
board,
and
the
board
subsequently
filed
this
complaint.
thereafter,
the
board
heard
the
evidence
with
the
respect
to
alleged
unfair
labor
practice
activity
and
issued
its
order
against
the
employer
to
the
cease-and-desist
in
the
conduct.
following
the
order
of
the
board,
a
second
election
was
held.
again,
which
the
union
lost,
and
that
election
was
set
aside
for
reasons
that
are
not
material
here
and
do
not
appear
in
this
record.
after
the
second
election,
the
board
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
for
an
order
in
forcing
its
order
against
the
respondent
company.
and
after
that
petition
to
the
court
of
appeals,
a
third
election
was
held.
and
again,
the
union
lost
the
election
but
at
this
time,
there
was
no
objections
filed
by
the
union
or
the
employees
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
election,
and
the
board
certified
the
election
as
be
invalid.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
believe
my
recollection
of
record
is
that
the
union's
votes
decreased.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yeah,
that
the
union's
position
became
stronger
in
the
situation
that
i
--
it's
in
the
record
here
but
that's
my
recollection
of
it.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
material
one
way
or
another
to
the
determination
of
this
issue,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
that
could
possibly
be
it
but
i
think
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
possibly
but
there's
so
many
other
factors
that
could
occur,
turnover
employees,
other
conduct
the
issues
raised
in
the
election.
i
would
say
that
you
almost
have
to
have
precise
evidence
so
the
point
like
that
mr.
chief
justice
before
that
would
be
a
supportable
inference
all
by
itself
from
just
a
mere
of
fact
if
the
votes
went
up
or
down,
one
way
or
another.
now,
that
would
be
my
opinion
in
this
regard.
when
the
case
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
no,
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
inference
can
be
gained
from
this
record
as
to
the
fact
that
it
was
set
aside.
there's
nothing
with
the
record,
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
for
the
government
to
suggest
inferentially
or
otherwise
or
that
that
second
election
was
set
aside
as
a
result
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
company,
and
the
record
doesn't
show
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
don't
want
to
infer
that
it
was
a
continuation
as
an
improper
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
in
the
part
of
the
company.
now,
when
the
matter
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit,
the
respondent
company
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
a
valid
subsequent
election
that
been
held
and
asked
the
court
to
dismiss
all
of
the
proceedings
involved
in
the
matter,
and
asked
it
to
rely
from
its
decision
in
the
general
engineering
case
of
1962.
the
court
in
a
per
curiam
decision
did
deny
the
respondent
company's
motion
to
dismiss
all
the
proceedings.
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
point
out
here
that
they
did
not
determine
on
the
merits
when
it
had
before
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
based
upon
the
record
considered
as
a
whole
and
the
law
of
whether
in
fact
the
respondent
company
was
guilty
of
committing
the
unfair
labor
practices.
they
just
saw
the
whole
--
through
the
whole
thing
out
on
the
grounds
that
the
matter
had
become
loop
and
no
longer
been
an
import
as
a
result
of
the
third
subsequent
valid
election.
the
board
petitioned
for
a
certiorari
raising
three
fundamental
questions.
one,
it
present
a
very
clear
precise
conflict
between
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
one
hand
of
the
second,
fourth
and
seventh
circuits
and
almost
identical
cases.
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
raytheon,
this
case
and
general
engineering
conflicts
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
with
very
clearly
enunciated
opinions
of
this
court
dealing
generally
and
broadly
in
this
field.
and
then
finally,
it
presented
a
good
question
of
policy
with
respect
to
the
effectuation
of
the
policies
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
respondent's
argument
in
the
case
seems
to
be
essentially
predicated
upon
the
statement
that
since
section
10
(e)
of
the
act,
confers
upon
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
that
discretion
is
a
broad
one
and
that
the
court
below
properly
exercised
this
broad
discretion
in
dismissing
this
case
on
the
grounds
of
mootness.
now,
as
preface
to
my
argument
and
if
the
court
will
grant
me
permission,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
case
that
was
not
cited
in
the
government's
brief
nor
in
briefs
filed
by
the
respondent
company.
i
called
mr.
resnick
monday
when
they
case
change
of
my
attention
and
indicated
my
desire
to
do
so,
and
i
believe
that
he
would
say
without
objection
that
i
made.
the
reason
why
it
was
not
cited,
it's
a
decision
of
mr.
justice
marshall
which
was
written
on
december
15th
of
this
term
of
the
court
and
it
was
handed
down
after
the
briefs
on
behalf
of
the
government
were
filed.
and
that's
your
case
nrlb
versus
rutter-rex.
the
reason
why
we
file
it
is
that
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
very
clearly
and
concisely
set
what
it
had
set
before
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
remedial
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
are
broad.
it's
a
broad
discretionary
power
and
they
are
subject
to
but
limited
review.
and
i
think
that
this
case
--
this
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
is
practically
dispositive
of
the
argument
of
the
respondent
company
here.
because
the
only
way
the
respondent
company
can
get
to
this
point
is
to
say
that
section
10
(e)
confers
upon
the
court
of
appeals.
they
brought
very
broad
discretionary
power
in
their
review
boarders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
best
example
of
that,
i
think
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
national
labor
relations
board
versus
mexia
textile
which
was
handed
down
by
this
court
in
1949.
in
that
case,
the
issue
was
whether
not
the
board
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
enforce
its
order,
even
if
the
respondent
employer
had
voluntarily
complied
with
the
order
of
the
board.
and
the
issue
was
raised
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
there's
no
reason
for
you
to
consider
this
matter
any
longer.
the
board
said
that
we
engaged
in
illegal
activity
in
conduct,
we
agreed
with
it,
we
have
complied
with
it,
so
why
haven't
order
the
board
enforcing
conduct
that
we've
already
complied
with
or
corrected.
the
supreme
court
and
this
court,
i
think
correctly
held
that
since
this
kind
of
conduct
can't
be
continuing
in
nature,
the
merely
showing
of
compliance
and
voluntary
or
not
by
the
employer
with
it
and
anyone
given
point
of
time,
should
not
be
a
bar
to
the
board's
right
to
get
an
enforcement
order,
so
that
it
would
have
available
to
it,
a
contempt
citation
and
order
in
the
event
the
employer
came
along
subsequent
to
its
voluntary
compliance
and
engaged
in
similar
conduct.
i
think
also
whether
the
decision
to
court
which
go
to
the
whole
question
of
mootness
bring
to
bare
the
essential
problem
that's
involved
in
this
case.
as
this
court
has
held
and
in
the
united
states
versus
w.t.
grant
company,
you
should
not
dismiss
a
case
on
the
grounds
of
mootness
until
only
there's
reasonable
expectation
that
there
will
never
be
a
reoccurrence
of
the
wrong
again,
that
there's
a
strong
burden
imposed
upon
the
wrong
doer
to
come
forward
and
show
that
regardless
of
our
intent
or
the
circumstances
that
it's
likely
that
the
conduct
would
never
occur
again.
and
i
think
again
as
this
court
has
held
in
walling
versus
reuter,
this
is
true,
so
that
the
courts
or
the
administrative
boards
and
agencies
can
always
have
in
its
hit
pockets
so
to
speak
the
arrow
to
its
bow
of
a
contempt
citation
issued
by
a
court
in
the
event
the
wrong
doer
commits
the
wrong
again.
and
then
finally
of
course
just
from
the
stand
point
of
public
policy
in
the
administration
of
the
act
and
i
think
at
this
point
that
court
should
be
primarily
concerned
about
because
if
you
take
the
respondents
argument
that
at
first
blush,
he
would
make
the
court
believe
either
way
that
there
is
something
integral
and
indigenous
about
section
8
of
the
act
leading
with
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
to
the
one
end
and
section
9
of
the
act
which
deals
with
representation
elections.
section
7
of
the
act
guarantees
to
employees
the
right
to
engage
in
the
concern
of
the
activities
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection,
and
i
think
that
this
guarantee
of
section
7
of
the
act
encompasses
several
portions
of
the
balance
of
the
act.
one
of
them
of
course
is
the
representation
election.
employees
under
this
act
have
a
right
to
a
free
environment,
the
board
has
set,
i
think
many
times
that
ask
ideally
under
the
laboratory
conditions
that
the
board
would
like
to
see
exist,
to
organize
among
themselves,
to
designate
a
union
as
their
collective
bargaining
agent,
to
have
representation
election
whereby
such
a
bargain
agent
can
be
certified.
but
this
right
that
is
conferred
upon
employees
in
terms
to
self-organization
is
a
distinct
separate
right
under
the
act
in
terms
of
its
policies
then
the
provisions
that
are
contained
in
section
8
of
the
act
that
deal
with
unfair
labor
practice
activity.
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
have
section
8
of
the
act
is
to
give
the
board
and
the
courts
a
machinery
by
which
you
can
create
these
so-called
laboratory
conditions,
so
that
employees
can
make
a
free
choice
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
their
collective
bargain
agent,
and
for
the
employer
to
come
along
as
the
respondent
company
has
in
this
case
to
say
the
we'll
really,
they've
had
two
or
three
shots
to
this
election
and
they've
lost
it.
and
what
we
might
have
done
with
respect
to
the
first
one
and
it
should
be
rendered
moot,
i
think
begs
the
question
because
all
you
have
to
do
then
is
to
permit
employers
to
engaged
in
this
kind
of
conduct
and
the
union
could
have
three
or
four,
or
five,
or
six
elections
and
the
courts
would
never
really
have
a
means
by
which
to
stop
the
yearly
go
activity
in
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes,
either
jones
&
laughlin
steel
case
of
1936.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
really
went
into
that
question,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
don't
believe
they
applied
in
a
standard
at
all,
if
they
been
aware
of
the
mexia
case
of
this
court
when
it
came
down
with
the
general
engineering
case
in
1962,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
ever
arrived
at
that
result.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
in
my
opinion,
what
should
be
done
is
to
vacate
the
act
of
the
court
of
appeals,
send
it
back
to
it,
have
it
determine
the
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
merits
and
the
record
consider
just
a
whole
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
then
get
the
court
of
appeals
which
i
wouldn't
expect
it
to
do
but
i
came
forth
with
an
erroneous
application
of
the
law
or
exercise
of
its
discretionary
power,
you'd
have
something
before
this
court
of
some
substance
in
merit.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well
mr.
justice
white,
that
raise
is
a
good
point
because
not
all
conduct
that
the
board
looks
that
as
being
improper
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
election
constitutes
with
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
--
like
the
24-hour
rule
for
instance.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
respondent
company
neglected
to
point
out
the
fact
that
of
the
three
forms
of
every
illegal
conduct
in
this
case
that
is
to
say
interrogated
in
the
employee
and
the
illegal
speech
that
this
company
also
initiated
a
new
grievance
procedure
which
the
board
held
was
unfair
labor
practice
conduct.
this
new
grievance
procedure
is
a
continuing
procedure
presumably
although
the
record
doesn't
show,
it
exists
today,
so
that
as
the
case
as
all
the
courts
held
in
second,
fourth,
and
seventh
circuits
these
unions
might
want
to
come
back
at
some
other
time
to
attempt
to
organize
the
employees,
they
have
the
right
indeed
in
this
case
the
inference
is
strong
if
they
would
want
to
because
they
tried
it
three
times
already.
and
if
you
had
in
the
environmental
factors
that
exist
at
this
particular
plan,
conduct
of
a
continuing
nature
which
the
board
is
said,
is
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
in
violation
of
section
881
and
section
7
of
the
act,
then
i
think
in
terms
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
these
employees
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
decide
the
choice
of
their
collective
bargaining
representative
and
in
free
environment
and
that's
the
essential
policy
of
the
act
that's
involved
here,
is
to
be
sure
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
being
given
the
weapon
that
the
statute
contemplated
that
is
to
say
a
contempt
citation
from
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
so
that
employers
will
restrained
from
engaging
in
a
continuing
form
of
conduct
in
order
that
at
least
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
act,
employees
will
be
able
to
choose
their
collective
bargaining
agent
in
the
environment
free
of
contort
and
coercion
or
inducements,
or
benefits,
threats
are
promises.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
to
quote
from
your
recent
decision.
i
believe
that
you
dissented
this
decision
but
the
majority
of
court
said
this
in
the
rutter-rex
case
that
i
mentioned
first.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
this
court
stated
in
there
that
the
remedial
power
of
the
board
is
a
broad
discretionary
one
subject
to
limited
judicial
review
and
let
me
just
indicate
the
facts
of
that
case,
that
was
a
backpay
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
going
to
cut
off
part
of
that
backpay
award
because
the
board
then
there
like
in
this
duty
the
properly
process
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
appropriately
planned
out
of
this
act
is
for
the
benefit
of
employees,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
board
or
an
employer
with
respect
to
the
backpay
orders.
but
that
was
backpay
order.
what
this
company,
this
respondent
company,
wants
you
to
do
is
to
completely
eliminate
a
section
8
limited
the
act
because
of
the
intervention
of
a
section
9
proceeding.
and
if
you
ever
got
down
to
the
point,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
administration
of
this
law
where
an
employer
or
a
union
because
it
now
applies
in
terms
of
this
illegal
activity
to
vote,
if
they
can
ever
excuse
their
unfair
labor
practice
activity
because
they
were
involved
in
a
representation
election,
then
i
think
you're
in
an
area
where
congress
itself
should
go
back
and
reexamine
the
whole
thing
from
a
standpoint
of
policy
as
to
what
the
act
was
supposed
to
do.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
think
it
pretty
well
pleases
itself,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
these
orders
usually
provide
is
that
the
employer
will
post
a
notice
for
60
days.
after
that
they
can
take
them
down,
and
then
the
conduct
that
is
usually
described
by
a
board
order
is
usually
pretty
precise
relating
to
specific
events,
times
and
circumstances
and
as
time
goes
by,
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
difficult
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
try
to
artificially
extend
other
conduct
under
a
contempt
citation.
as
you
know
the
courts
are
very
reluctant
to
the
exercise
their
power,
their
discretion,
in
contempt
situations
and
in
the
years
of
practice
that
i
had
in
this
area,
i
can
never
recall
a
contempt
case
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
was
claimed
that
they
exercised
that
authority
without
regard
to
the
specific
conduct
that
was
subject
to
the
board's
order.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
more
than
just
a
couple
of
minutes
as
the
chief
justice
please.
i'd
like
to
begin
at
the
end
and
respond
to
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice.
section
8
(c)
of
the
act,
confers
upon
employers
and
employees
free
speech
right,
and
there
is
a
means
by
which
that
you
could
determine
whether
or
not
your
first
amendment
rights
under
the
constitution
had
been
adequately
protected
under
that
section.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
respondent
company
here
can
pull
itself
up
by
its
bootstraps
with
respect
to
the
position
it
takes
in
this
case
because
although
i
was
not
present
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals,
i've
argued
several
such
cases.
i
don't
know
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
what
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
thinking
about
but
i
do
know
what
the
record
says.
with
respect
to
this
whole
question
of
mootness,
and
it
says
this
on
page
48
of
the
appendix,
and
it's
a
per
curiam
statement
by
the
three
judges,
during
oral
argument
in
this
court,
counsel
for
raytheon
made
a
suggestion
of
mootness,
and
the
court
grant
them
lead
to
file
a
motion,
and
then
the
court
said
accordingly
on
the
authority
of
general
engineering
inc.,
raytheon's
motions
are
granted
and
that
proceedings
are
dismissed.
in
general
engineering
inc.,
it
goes
off
solely
on
the
question
of
mootness.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
the
question
well,
how
long
is
this
general
engineering
case
been
around.
it
was
decided
in
1962,
mr.
justice
but
in
1963,
the
seventh
circuit,
and
in
1956,
the
fourth
circuit
being
aware
of
the
general
engineering
case,
refused
to
follow
it
and
followed
a
different
result
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
relied
upon
this
second
circuit
decision
in
clark
brothers
in
1947,
and
i
honestly
believe
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
had
before
it
the
mexia
textile
case
and
the
clark
brothers
case
are
they
would
never
arrive
at
the
result
that
they
did
in
general
election.
with
respect
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
on
what
happened
when
you
declared
moot,
what
you
have
is
a
naked
ineffectual
statement
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
an
employer
is
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
conduct
but
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
and
i
think
that
that
would
further
complicate
the
situation
because
you
would
again
have
the
total
environment
be
clouded
by
a
statement
by
national
labor
relations
board
that
this
company
didn't
engaged
in
illegal
conduct
and
yet
if
in
fact
it
had,
there
couldn't
be
an
order
of
the
court
to
make
them
cut
it
out
and
if
that
happened,
i
think
the
company
would
be
under
the
burden
always
and
be
accused
of
this
type
of
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
yes,
it
would.
i
think,
what
it
would
do
instead
mr.
chief
justice
would
run
right
up
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
you
gave
us
an
order,
an
order
these
people
not
to
do
this
and
now
that
they've
done
it
and
we
want
you
now
to
hold
them
guilty
of
contempt.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
that
might
have
some
impact
on
the
board's
decision
and
than
you
get
into
problems
of
whether
or
not
improper
inferences
or
illegal
influences
were
drawn
as
the
result
of
prior
conduct.
i
think
the
best
way
to
clean
the
case
up
really
and
get
rid
of
this
principle
of
law
that
inadvertently
came
on
ninth
circuit
and
doesn't
square
itself
with
the
policy
of
this
court
whether
the
decision
of
other
circuits
is
to
send
it
back
there
and
ask
them
to
find
out
whether
in
fact
this
company
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
activity,
if
the
they
didn't,
then
dismiss
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle,
and
if
they
did,
they
may
come
susceptible
to
contempt
citation.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
if
you
interpreted
my
remarks
of
saying
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
misunderstood
me.
i
said
that
there
is
conceivably
some
facts
situation
where
they
could.
i
don't
believe
they
exist
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
and
if
you
got
that
impression
from
my
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
can
take
--
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
oh,
i
agree
with
you
that,
mr.
justice
white
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
that
kind
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
right.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
well,
i
think
this
court
has
applied
the
standard
generally,
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
has
misapplied
it.
i
don't
believe
that
this
record
shows
that
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
under
any
circumstances
that
this
kind
(voice
overlap)
had
occurred.
mr.
richard
g.
kleindienst
i
fully
agree
to
that.
i
just
think
it
did
on
the
wrong
standard,
your
honor.
i
fully
agree
to
that
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you.
