justice
byron
r.
white
but
you,
mr.
attorney
general,
you
seem
to
agree
that
if
a
court
determined
there
is
no
really
substantial
chance
of
the
conduct
ever
being
repeated
that
it
could
be
dismissed
as
a
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
just
really
amongst
to
us
a
sort
of
the
fact
bound
case
then
the
here
--
you
just
want
us
to
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
conduct
contrary
to
their
taking
really,
really
might
occur
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
they
applied
the
wrong
standard
or
any
standard
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
we
should
vacate
the
judgment
and
have
them
reconsidered
under
the
right
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
that
certain
unfair
labor
practice
could
be
so
tied
to
a
particular
election
like
for
example
within
the
first
election,
they
had
a
poll
watch
or
something
that
they
shouldn't
have.
there
was
a
complaint
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree,
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
i
suppose
there's
some
kind
of
conduct
in
connection
with
the
election
that
no
reasonable
man
would
take
whatever
be
repeated.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
resnick,
what's
the
consequence
of
holding
an
issue
moot
in
a
situation
like
this,
does
the
board
adjudication
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
enforcement
but
the
board
has
issued
a
final
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
connection
of
the
representation
proceeding
would
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
little
inconsistent
with
what
you
said
earlier
that
you
seem
to
concede
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
the
determination
that
there
wasn't
any
substantial
chance
of
any
recurrence
of
this
conduct
that
it
could
have
reach
properly
refuse
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
certainly
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
court
--
a
court
can
find
that
in
can
be
conceded
by
the
union
that
no
there's
no
--
really
no
substantial
chance,
no
meaningful
chance
that
this
conduct
will
every
reoccur?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
nevertheless
we
insist
that
you
adjudicate
this
--
adjudicate
this
unfair
labor
practice
which
will
take
you
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
and
then
if
you
would
agree
with
the
board,
you
must
enter
a
cease-and-desist
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
and
that's
--
but
that's
another
point
of
why
should
we
--
you
apparently
take
there
is
some
standard
by
which
of
mootness
or
non-enforceability
should
be
judged,
and
you
--
at
the
very
least
you
claim
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
apply
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
that
kind
of
a
standard
that
didn't
apply,
why
shouldn't
that
have
the
job
of
the
not
us
of
the
first
applying
of
the
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
court
of
appeals
that
have
job
to
doing
in
the
first
instance
under
the
right
standard?
if
they
did
it
under
the
wrong
standard,
i'm
not
saying
that
(voice

wrong.
