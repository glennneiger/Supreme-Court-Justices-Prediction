mr.
kleindiesnt,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
mr.
kleindienst
whether
the
union's
votes
increased
or
decreased?
what
happened
in
this
successive
election?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
decreased?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
their
votes
--
if
their
total
ballot
decreased
as
each
election
went
on
it
might
suggest
some
relationship
between
the
companies
the
continuing
impact,
the
continuing
effect
of
the
companies
at
a
union
activities
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
it's
an
arguable
connection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
attorney
general,
if
in
effects
there
is
to
be
an
open
end
injunction
which
is
what
this
amounts
to,
it
gives
the
court
with
continuing
contempt
powers,
there
ought
to
be
some
pretty
clear
guidelines
as
to
how
to
define
a
continuing
impact,
is
that
not
so?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you.
mr.

more
favorable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
the
attorney
general
was
correct
that
it's
--
that
you
can't
give
it
much
weight
to
one
way
or
the
other
but
it
seems
to
me
as
practical
matter
if
you
were
to
give
it
any
weight.
in
any
degree
it
would
that
whatever
the
conduct
of
the
employer
is,
it
isn't
depressing
the
union's
vote
getting
ability.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
yet
made
an
argument
that
courts
ought
to
be
very
careful
about
having
a
prior
restraint
on
first
amendment
--
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
speaking
to
their
employees.
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
resnick.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
about
to
five
minutes
left
if
you
would
to
use
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
have
some
of
the
fact,
would
it
not,
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
sense,
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
existence
of
the
determination
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
if
a
new
complaint
were
issued
on
at
a
later
time
and
the
conduct
was
similar
conduct
the
board
certainly
would
have
its
eye
on
the
prior
determination,
it
would
have
a
carryover.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
speaking
--
i'm
on
going
on
the
assumption
that
there
would
be
no
continuing
effect
if
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
was
left
standing
and
you
have
no
enforcement
order.
there
would
still
be
some
impact
on
the
unfair
labor
practice
determination
itself,
would
there
not?
