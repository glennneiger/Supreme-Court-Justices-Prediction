there
is
counter
to
a
big
chapter
in
the
american
history
involving
compulsory
public
school
attendance.
justice
william

i'm
just
thinking
in
terms
of
closing
the
door
or
shutting
our
eyes,
shutting
your
ears
off
and
just
becoming
isolated
from
the
whole
world.
maybe
that's
a
good
constitutional
doctrine,
but
we
never
yet
decided
it?

oh,
we
had
it
in
the
pierce
case,
in
sister's
case
from
oregon
and
a
phase
of
that
was
hear
parent's
right
from
education
control
the
education
to
child
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
just
--
i
wasn't
making
the
point,
i
was
just
sounding
a
caveat
on
this
big
general
principle
you
were
trying
to
get
us
to
embrace.
justice
william

douglas
what
you
mean
to
say
that
if
the
addressee
includes
that
one
thing
that
he
received
was
pandering,
he
can
have
that
stopped
and
it
was
therefore
stopped
everything
coming
from
the
same
sender,
even
though
it
might
not
to
be
pandering
on
the
second,
or
third,
or
tenth,
or
hundredth
mailing?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
in
terms
of
literature,
it
might
not
be
way
off
on
one
end?
