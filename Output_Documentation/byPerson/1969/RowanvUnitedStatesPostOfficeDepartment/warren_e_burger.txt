mr.
taback,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact
do
will
you
mean
alternative
positions
or
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
correct
adaptation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
case,
isn't
it
right
there,
the
while
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
your
view
that
the
statute
is
broad
enough
so
that
if
it
could
reach
sears
roebuck
catlog
or
montgomery
word
“catalog”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
a
citizen
has
no
right
to
say
the
sears
roebuck
or
montgomery
word,
i
don't
want
your
catalog
and
don't
send
it
to
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
place
this
on
a
higher
claims
or
more
preferred
position
than
the
right
to
address
oral
communications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
would
follow
that
your
clients
could
stand
outside
of
the
mailbox
or
on
the
premises
and
make
a
speech,
and
require
the
occupant
to
listen
to
it,
there
are
no
difference
in
the
claims.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
a
little
bit
of
trespass
in
there,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
you
should
have
to
walk
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
doesn't
want
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
paramount
over
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
a
connection
between
what
the
court
had
to
say
in
ginzburg
about
the
pandering
aspect
and
the
limitations
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
would
have
--
would
be
inhibited
in
anyway
from
passing
the
statute
that
upon
request
of
a
householder
no
mailman
set
foot
on
or
put
any
mail
in
the
box
or
on
the
premises
of
a
householder?
he
said,
i
don't
want
the
mailman
here,
just
cut
me
off,
do
you
see
a
constitutional
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
he
doesn't
want
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
that
it
would
follow
if
you
put
a
high
wall
and
a
bunch
of
very
disagreeable
dogs
out
to
keep
people
away,
somehow
or
other
the
householder
would
be
violating
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all
the
potential
mailers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
mean,
i
can
violate
to
your
client's
first
amendment
rights
but
the
government
is
holding
and
i
as
an
individual
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
the
american
bar
association
took
a
position
on
a
substantive
merit
through
the
statute
itself
or
just
the
procedural
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
want
to
put
the
burden
on
the
taxpayer,
the
recipient
to
ought
to
the
garbage
pail
or
whatever
to
dispose
it.
collectively,
that
burden
is
a
large
burden
and
if
you
have
200,000
people
on
you
mailing
list,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
taback.
mr.
ruckelshaus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
is
there
any,
going
back
to
mr.
justice
douglas
point,
question
is
there
any
federal
authority
that
can
make
anybody
go
to
school,
any
where,
any
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
matter
of
state
that
you're
trying
to
make
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
some
states
might
say
you
have
to
go
school
and
until
you're
12,
and
others
might
say,
14,
and
other
might
say
some
other
age.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
and
we've
never
found
this
--
so
far
as
i
know
have
we
--
any
federal
constitutional
barrier
to
a
state
requiring
students
to
go
and
listen
as
justice
douglas
suggested
to
teachers
and
attend
school
or
has
the
question
never
been
brought
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
regard
it
as
no
different
basically,
constitutionally
from
turning
off
the
radio
or
the
television
by
the
twist
of
the
dial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
only
difference
would
be
that
if
the
appellant
claims
that
this
is
expensive
for
him
to
be
turned
off?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
this
record
about
the
sender's
having
a
pattern
of
sending
some
of
this
material
to
11,
12-year-old,
7th
and
8th's
grade
people
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
it
altered
in
the
schools?
