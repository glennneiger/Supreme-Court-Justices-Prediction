mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
that
the
--
now
that
there
seems
to
be
some
concern
about
just
precisely
what
the
government's
position
is,
either
below
or
in
our
motion
to
affirm
in
our
brief,
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear,
precisely
what
the
government's
position
is.
it's
our
position
that
congress
has
said,
when
an
individual
in
our
society
receives
through
the
mail
material
which
in
his
sole
discretion,
he
believes
to
be
a
pandering
advertising
and
he
again
finds
in
his
sole
discretion
this
material
to
be
erotically
arousing
or
sexually
provocative,
he
can
tell
the
sender,
“don't
send
me
anymore
material!”
and
he
lists,
the
addressee
a
list
--
enlist
to
support
of
the
post
office
in
informing
the
sender
of
his
desires
and
if
the
sender
persist,
after
one
prohibiting
from
the
post
office,
he
maybe
enjoined
from
continuing
to
send
the
material
to
an
unwilling
recipient.
if
he
still
persists,
he
maybe
held
in
contempt
by
that
court
which
has
issued
the
injunction
for
violating
the
court's
order.
we
believe
that
congress
has
sought
to
protect
a
man
in
his
own
home.
congress
knew,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
reaches
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
i
think
that
it
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
although
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
would
take
it
that
the
alternative
to
attempting
to
limit
this
to
a
man's
home,
would
be
extremely
difficult
if
not
being
easily
discernible
where
a
man
would
live,
for
instance
or
where
he
could
object
to
this
kind
of
thing
or
anything
coming
into
his
home.
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
obviously
was
to
protect
a
man
his
own
home
and
if
there
was
language
in
the
statute
which
extended
that
purpose,
it
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
--
under
the
broadest
possible
interpretation,
i
assume
that
it
could
but
it
was
obviously
aimed
at
an
individual,
although
if
you
send
it,
the
statute
that
it
says
if
you
send
it
an
address,
listed
only
to
occupant
that
that
is
a
violation
of
prohibitory
order
against
that
address.
so,
i
imagine
the
same
thing
would
apply.
we
think
that
congress
said
that
a
man
in
his
own
home
has
the
right
to
be
unreasonable
and
they
also
sought
to
protect
the
unreasonable
man
in
his
own
home.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
it
has
to
be
a
pandering
advertisement,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
statute
is
clear
on
that.
i
think
it
is
the
advertising
nature
of
the
material
that
is
sought
to
be
controlled
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
you
might.
i
take
it
there
would
some
gray
area
as
to
precisely
what
an
advertisement
was.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
can
notify
the
post
office
although,
this
he
would
be
in
himself
violating
the
obvious
intent
of
the
statute
and
nevertheless
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
but
assuming
again
that
it
has
some
relation
to
a
pandering
advertisement
as
far
as
the
individual
was
concerned,
i
think
that
given
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
was
due
rule
number
one
to
leave
it
in
his
discretion
as
to
what
he
should
refuse
to
receive
and
secondly,
to
get
the
administrative
branch
and
the
courts
out
business
to
determine
whether
he
was
rational
in
that
exercise.
it's
necessary
for
him
took
also
be
able
to
say,
this
is
in
my
own
home
as
far
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
want
to
receive
this.
it's
erotically
arousing
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
the
interpretation
which
i
think
must
be
given
to
the
statute
given
the
congressional
history
and
intent.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
significance
is
that
this
language
is
as
evidenced
by
the
pamphlet
that
the
post
office
itself
has
put
out
the
language
was
to
tell
the
individual
this
what
we're
trying
to
get
--
give
you
a
chance
to
refuse
to
receive
in
your
home.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
the
post
office
could
make
such
a
determination,
i
--
we
submit
that
if
would
frustrate
the
second
purpose
of
congress
which
was
to
get
the
post
office
out
of
the
business
of
censorship.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was
to
tell
the
individual
in
his
home
that
this
is
what
congress
intended
was
to
allow
you
to
get
pandering
material
out
of
your
home.
and
in
spite
of
the
brief
of
the
direct
mail
advertisers
in
amicus
brief,
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
being
widely
abused
by
individuals
in
their
home.
and
we
have
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief
some
368,000
complaints
in
the
post
office
and
the
justice
department.
at
the
end
of
last
month,
we
had
filed
some
21,000
complaints.
we
do
not
--
we
have
not
filed
any
complaints
and
off
in
an
effort
to
enforce
the
prohibitory
order
that
have
--
not
having
to
do
with
the
some
sexual
orientation.
now,
that
i
think
what
congress
was
recognizing
that
if
they're
going
to
get
the
courts
and
administrative
branch
out
they
have
to
give
this
discretion
to
the
individual
that
even
to
be
unreasonable
in
his
own
home.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
regulation
that
the
post
office
now
has
which
under
--
in
a
footnote
to
the
lamont
case
and
in
the
regulation
itself
has
been
so
interpreted
an
individual
could
notify
the
post
office
and
say,
“i
don't
want
to
receive
anymore
mail.”
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
any
constitutional
difficulty
with
that,
this
is
our
position.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
precisely
the
same
argument.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
pandering
advertisement
is
in
the
statute
even
in
this
context
is
to
notify
the
individual,
this
is
what
we
meant
and
not
to
have
that
individual
use
his
power
to
prohibit
somebody
from
coming
into
his
home
and
communicating
with
him
indiscriminately
and
unreasonably.
and
that
really
what
we
have
here
is
very
analogous
to
the
right
of
an
individual
has
to
turn
off
the
television
set,
to
turn
the
radio
if
he's
listening
to
a
speech
in
a
park
to
simply
walk
from
the
speech.
now,
he
is
here
using
the
post
office
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
it's
a
broad
right
to,
mr.
justice
white
of
privacy
and
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
know
that
we
have
to
find
such
a
right
existing
in
the
constitution.
i
think
if
you
take
judge
cooley's
statement
in
his
law
of
torts,
simply
the
right
to
be
let
alone
as
a
common
law
right,
not
necessarily
a
constitutional
right
or
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggested
in
griswold
against
connecticut,
that
if
the
right
itself
emanates
hope
from
the
totality
of
constitutional
scheme
under
which
we
live,
i
think
nevertheless
it
has
become
more
and
more
important
in
our
society
that
we
recognize
a
right
simply
to
let
alone.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
absolutely.
i
think
he
has
the
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it's
the
right
--
the
right
certainly
--
the
right
to
receive
is
just
as
important
as
the
right
to
communicate
and
has
been
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
a
corollary
certainly
of
the
right
to
receive.
at
least
in
the
in
the
mail
cases
the
right
to
receive
has
been
recognized
the
by
supreme
court
and
i
think
there
is
a
corollary
of
it
the
right
not
to
receive
and
i
think
in
this
society
that
we
live
in,
it's
as
strength
and
as
communication
becomes
more
and
more
widespread
and
the
variety
of
ideas
and
thought
in
our
culture
becomes
less
and
there's
the
population
grows
and
as
we
come
together
and
live
closer
in
cities
and
as
we
talked
about
not
only
air
and
water
pollution,
but
also
noise
pollution
that
this
right
to
be
let
alone,
his
right
that
needs
to
be
recognized
in
our
law
and
needs
to
be
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
i
think
that
certainly
is
corollary
to
the
right
to
receive
whatever
he
wants
to.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
the
compulsory
public
school
attendance,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
think
that's
right.
we
have
not
and
this
court
has
not
under
the
constitution
decided
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
close
his
eyes
or
refuse
to
hear.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
brief
case
involves
door-to-door
solicitation
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
hollick
case
involved
the
--
again,
this
was
not
in
this
case
the
hollick
case
that
at
the
bus
company
and
did
have
the
right
pursuant
to
district
of
columbia
ordinance
to
play
music
on
the
bus
and
the
right
of
privacy
did
not
refer
to
the
people
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
were
--
we're
dealing
with
these
kinds
of
rights,
we
have
to
be
careful
to
delineate
each
one
for
discussing
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
clearly
the
right
to
receive
has
a
corollary
of
a
right
to
turn
off
unwanted
material
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
statute.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right
it's
the
states
which
have
laws
which
provide
that
of
age
of
16
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that
is
--
there
is
no
constitutional
right
that
--
or
constitutional
mandate
that
people
have
to
go
to
school
up
until
a
certain
age.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
this
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
parent
the
right
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
the
principle
itself
is
it
has
to
be
delineated
on
case-by-case
basis,
but
i
think
the
principle
itself
as
suggested
in
the
amicus
brief
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
only
the
right
control
knowledge
about
oneself
is
and
will
become
a
considerably
broader
concept
and
the
way
they
would
attempt
to
limit
it
in
that
case.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
provision
itself
is
concerned,
i
think
that
we
have
a
basic
distinction
in
what
the
congress
sought
to
do
in
this
statute
and
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
that
have
been
upheld
in
previous
mail
cases
and
the
previous
cases
in
this
court.
and
that
is
that
here,
where
individual
decides
he
wants
no
further
communication
from
a
mailer,
his
decision
affects
only
himself
and
i
think
this
is
the
prism
through
which
the
first
amendment
claim
here
has
to
be
viewed.
in
all
other
cases,
where
an
individual,
or
an
agency,
or
a
governmental
unit
decided
that
they
did
not
like
what
was
being
communicated,
their
attempt
to
stop
the
communication
did
not
affect
even
a
single
individual
or
the
majority,
it
affected
everyone
and
that
there
is
a
great
distinction
between
this
case
and
those
kind
of
cases.
we're
not
talking
about
a
case
where
the
post
master
general
would
say,
you
can't
send
anymore
mail
through
the
--
or
anymore
of
this
kind
of
material
or
magazines,
or
books
through
the
mail
to
anyone.
now,
he
simply
saying
this
individual
in
the
society
has
told
me,
i
don't
want
to
be
communicated
from
the
sender
anymore
and
he
is
notifying
the
sender
of
that
individual's
desire.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sender's
right
to
communicate
to
everyone
else
within
the
society.”
if
you're
talking
about
a
chill
on
the
first
amendment
rights,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anyone
else
has
been
inhibited
from
receiving
of
that
material
if
that's
their
desire
and
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
there's
any
change
in
the
material
that
is
being
send
out,
it
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
is
being
distributed.
and
i
think
about
the
same
token
in
the
bynum
books
case
where
we
have
a
censorship
board,
where
what
the
censorship
board
did
to
an
individual
book
distributors
in
rhode
island
is
now
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here,
because
it's
then
affected
everyone
and
here
it
only
affects
an
individual.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
the
difficulties
in
the
other
cases
is
that
decision
of
a
majority
or
a
single
could
affect
what
every
man
wanted
to
receive
and
that
situation
does
not
happen
it
here.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
simply
turning
off
speech
and
as
has
been
suggested,
i
think
that
the
right
to
receive
has
the
corollary
right
of
not
to
receive.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
see
any
distinction
because
i
believe
that
the
individual
obviously
has
this
right
and
he
can't
turn
off
the
mail
without
some
assistance
from
the
post
master.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
that
claim
of
expense
is
there
because
in
the
past
there
was
no
concern
as
far
as
the
senders
were
concern
about
the
sensibilities
of
the
addressees.
and
what
congress
said,
is
this
going
to
have
to
have
to
be
a
cost
of
your
business.
when
an
addressee
is
offended
by
material
that
you
send
him
he
has
the
right
to
tell
you
not
to
send
him
anymore?
and
then
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it's
right
but
the
only
reason
the
government
is
not
implicated
as
a
sensor
or
has
an
inhibitor
or
prohibiter
of
first
amendment
rights,
they're
implicated
simply
because
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
turned
off
and
that
what
congress
has
done
in
any
implicating
government
and
i
agree
that's
why
i
agree
with
you
that
is
why
it
is
here
--
is
simply
used
him
as
the
hand
that
turns
off
the
radio
and
television.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
he
could
maybe
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
see
your
point,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
think
that's
what
was
congress'
point
that
the
cost
involved
is
simply
a
recognition
that
he
has
to
give
to
the
sensibilities
of
the
recipient
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
should
render
this
statute
with
any
constitutional
difficulty.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
great
deal
of
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
congressional
record
and
then
in
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
this
is
obviously
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
get
at.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
is
what
these
plaintiffs
or
appellants
here
were
doing
or
the
direct
mail
orders.
as
congressman
waldie,
i
think
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
the
man
who
gave
the
shape
to
this
present
statute,
he
said,
i
am
the
supreme
court
in
the
particular
household
in
which
my
children
reside,
and
from
my
decision
there
is
no
appeal.
and
i
would
take
it
that
this
is
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
do.
to
say
that
a
man
in
his
own
home
can
refuse
to
receive
material
because
it
might
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
his
children
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
this
was
his
decision
in
his
own
home
and
there
is
--
and
that
legislative
history
is
replete
with
this
kind
of
testimony.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
what
kind
of
an
order,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
reprint
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
under
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
individual
himself
in
his
sole
discretion.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
as
we
have
discussed,
i
think
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
can
be
said
to
be
ambiguous.
the
court
below
seem
to
read
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
what
section
(a)
of
the
statute
says,
mr.
justice
black.
it
also
says
in
section
(c)
of
the
statute,
the
order
of
post
master
general
shall
expressly
prohibit
the
sender
and
his
agents
or
assigns
from
making
any
further
mailings
to
the
designated
addressee.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
any
mailings,
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
any
further
mailings,
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
(a)
can
only
be
understood
if
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
and
i
think
the
post
master
general
is
equally
concerned
about
having
that
onus
upon
his
shoulders
and
he
in
the
administrative
pamphlet
which
has
been
put
out
in
the
order
that
sense
out,
he
sees
this
statute
as
meaning
precisely
what
congress
itself
saw
its
meaning
and
that
is
that
he
had
no
discretion
to
determine
what
was,
and
what
was
not
a
pandering?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
mean
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because,
mr.
justice
black,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
isn't
what
they
trying
to
do.
they
tried
to
do
two
things.
they
tried
to
give
the
individual
the
right
to
decide
in
his
own
discretion,
what
was
and
what
was
not
pandering
or
what
was
sexually
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
you
read
section
(a)
as
having
pandering
advertisement
being
modified
also
by
in
his
sole
discretion
and
which
--
in
a
way
in
which
it
can
be
read,
it
is
clear
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
so,
legislative
history
shows
that
it's
clear,
this
is
what
the
congress
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
reason
they
did
not
want
to
do
that
was
because
there
is
a
lot
of
controversy
within
congress
over
the
merits
or
demerits
of
so-called
junk
mail.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
they
did
--
the
evil,
at
which
congress
was
attempting
to
direct
itself,
was
the
mailing
into
the
individual's
home
of
material
that
was
pornographic,
or
was
obscene,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
and
congress
had
a
second
purpose
which
was
to
get
the
administrative
branch
and
the
courts
out
of
the
business
of
making
this
determination.
and
therefore,
they
put
pandering
advertisement
in
the
statute
and
left
it
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
individual
to
decide
it.
hoping
that
not
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
section
(a)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
this
is
not
the
post
master
general's
interpretation.
it
is
not
our
interpretation.
we
don't
believe
it's
what
the
congress
intended
from
the
legislative
history,
and
i
think
the
statute
can
be
rationally
read
as
meaning
that
all
further
mail
was
to
be
prohibited
and
that
only
discretion
that
the
post
master
general
had
was
to
decide,
whether
there
had
been
a
mailing
that
was
objected
to
by
an
addressee,
that
was
an
advertisement.
and
then
what
he
sends
this
information
back
to
the
sender
and
says,
“no
further
mailings
are
to
be
sent”
which
is
precisely
what
his
order
says
as
reprinted
at
the
back
of
appellant;s
opening
brief.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
it
says,
no
further
mailings,
whatsoever,
not
any
similar
mailings.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas
because
the
alternative
was
to
make
the
sender
decide
what
was
pandering,
have
that
decision
reviewed
by
the
administrative
branch
and
then
again,
reviewed
by
courts
and
the
congress
saw
that
is
getting
his
right
back
into
the
problem
that
existed
before.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
i
think
he
can
decide
that
very
easily.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
think
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
because
of
the
obvious
difficulties
in
deciding
what
is
pandering
and
what
isn't
and
the
more
objective
standards
that
can
be
used
in
deciding,
what
is
an
advertisement?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i've
--
we
have,
i
think
discussed
in
our
brief
that
there
are
some
apparent
difficulties
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
i
think
when
you
read
section
(a)
in
conjunction
with
(b)
and
(c),
it's
clear
that
what
the
congress
intended
and
what
the
statute
says
is
any
further
mailings.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
he
is
authorized
to
request
the
attorney
general
who
is
authorized
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
the
court
will
ever
have
such
case
before
it
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
mr.
justice
white
and
if
it
does,
i
think
that
given
this
structures
of
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
does
not.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
keep
the
courts
from
having
to
do
was
to
make
this
determination
again
in
this
instance
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
assuming
that
the
attorney
general
brought
such
a
case.
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it's
says
he's
authorized
to
bring
the
case,
it
doesn't
shall
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
but
its
way
off
on
one
end
mr.
justice
white,
in
terms
of
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
mean
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
there
was
an
abuse
--
of
an
obvious
abuse
of
a
lower
court's
decision
in
issuing
which
is
basically
an
equitable
proceeding
and
injunction
that
--
there
might
be
some
grounds
for
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
but
the
--
we
have
used
the
standard
in
our
brief
as
a
suggested
standard
of
a
good
faith
standard.
any
standard
that
you
use,
you
have
difficulty
with
it
because
how
can
you
determine
good
faith
to
the
addressees
not
a
present
in
court
and
he
may
will
not
be
present
in
court
if
he
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
country.
so,
that
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
a
court
would
received
one
of
these
things
that
obviously
what
wasn't
advertisement,
they
had
no
relation
whatsoever
the
pandering
our
sexually
oriented
material
that
a
court
couldn't
in
its
equity
power
refused
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
entering
an
order.
just
as
the
attorney
general
where
it
says
he's
authorized
to
bring
such
a
case
and
where
it
says,
in
the
second
stage
the
post
master
general
is
authorized
to
request
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
go
that
far.
i
think
it
may
well
be
if
it's
potatoes
that
the
court
on
the
appeal
could
it
be
said
to
have
abused
its
discretion.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
that
the
--
now
that
there
seems
to
be
some
concern
about
just
precisely
what
the
government's
position
is,
either
below
or
in
our
motion
to
affirm
in
our
brief,
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear,
precisely
what
the
government's
position
is.
it's
our
position
that
congress
has
said,
when
an
individual
in
our
society
receives
through
the
mail
material
which
in
his
sole
discretion,
he
believes
to
be
a
pandering
advertising
and
he
again
finds
in
his
sole
discretion
this
material
to
be
erotically
arousing
or
sexually
provocative,
he
can
tell
the
sender,
“don't
send
me
anymore
material!”
and
he
lists,
the
addressee
a
list
--
enlist
to
support
of
the
post
office
in
informing
the
sender
of
his
desires
and
if
the
sender
persist,
after
one
prohibiting
from
the
post
office,
he
maybe
enjoined
from
continuing
to
send
the
material
to
an
unwilling
recipient.
if
he
still
persists,
he
maybe
held
in
contempt
by
that
court
which
has
issued
the
injunction
for
violating
the
court's
order.
we
believe
that
congress
has
sought
to
protect
a
man
in
his
own
home.
congress
knew,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
reaches
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
i
think
that
it
would,
mr.
justice
brennan.
although
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
would
take
it
that
the
alternative
to
attempting
to
limit
this
to
a
man's
home,
would
be
extremely
difficult
if
not
being
easily
discernible
where
a
man
would
live,
for
instance
or
where
he
could
object
to
this
kind
of
thing
or
anything
coming
into
his
home.
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
obviously
was
to
protect
a
man
his
own
home
and
if
there
was
language
in
the
statute
which
extended
that
purpose,
it
was
necessary
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
--
under
the
broadest
possible
interpretation,
i
assume
that
it
could
but
it
was
obviously
aimed
at
an
individual,
although
if
you
send
it,
the
statute
that
it
says
if
you
send
it
an
address,
listed
only
to
occupant
that
that
is
a
violation
of
prohibitory
order
against
that
address.
so,
i
imagine
the
same
thing
would
apply.
we
think
that
congress
said
that
a
man
in
his
own
home
has
the
right
to
be
unreasonable
and
they
also
sought
to
protect
the
unreasonable
man
in
his
own
home.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
it
has
to
be
a
pandering
advertisement,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
statute
is
clear
on
that.
i
think
it
is
the
advertising
nature
of
the
material
that
is
sought
to
be
controlled
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
you
might.
i
take
it
there
would
some
gray
area
as
to
precisely
what
an
advertisement
was.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
can
notify
the
post
office
although,
this
he
would
be
in
himself
violating
the
obvious
intent
of
the
statute
and
nevertheless
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
but
assuming
again
that
it
has
some
relation
to
a
pandering
advertisement
as
far
as
the
individual
was
concerned,
i
think
that
given
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
was
due
rule
number
one
to
leave
it
in
his
discretion
as
to
what
he
should
refuse
to
receive
and
secondly,
to
get
the
administrative
branch
and
the
courts
out
business
to
determine
whether
he
was
rational
in
that
exercise.
it's
necessary
for
him
took
also
be
able
to
say,
this
is
in
my
own
home
as
far
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
want
to
receive
this.
it's
erotically
arousing
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
the
interpretation
which
i
think
must
be
given
to
the
statute
given
the
congressional
history
and
intent.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
significance
is
that
this
language
is
as
evidenced
by
the
pamphlet
that
the
post
office
itself
has
put
out
the
language
was
to
tell
the
individual
this
what
we're
trying
to
get
--
give
you
a
chance
to
refuse
to
receive
in
your
home.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
if
the
post
office
could
make
such
a
determination,
i
--
we
submit
that
if
would
frustrate
the
second
purpose
of
congress
which
was
to
get
the
post
office
out
of
the
business
of
censorship.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was
to
tell
the
individual
in
his
home
that
this
is
what
congress
intended
was
to
allow
you
to
get
pandering
material
out
of
your
home.
and
in
spite
of
the
brief
of
the
direct
mail
advertisers
in
amicus
brief,
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
being
widely
abused
by
individuals
in
their
home.
and
we
have
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief
some
368,000
complaints
in
the
post
office
and
the
justice
department.
at
the
end
of
last
month,
we
had
filed
some
21,000
complaints.
we
do
not
--
we
have
not
filed
any
complaints
and
off
in
an
effort
to
enforce
the
prohibitory
order
that
have
--
not
having
to
do
with
the
some
sexual
orientation.
now,
that
i
think
what
congress
was
recognizing
that
if
they're
going
to
get
the
courts
and
administrative
branch
out
they
have
to
give
this
discretion
to
the
individual
that
even
to
be
unreasonable
in
his
own
home.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
regulation
that
the
post
office
now
has
which
under
--
in
a
footnote
to
the
lamont
case
and
in
the
regulation
itself
has
been
so
interpreted
an
individual
could
notify
the
post
office
and
say,
“i
don't
want
to
receive
anymore
mail.”
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that
there'd
be
any
constitutional
difficulty
with
that,
this
is
our
position.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
precisely
the
same
argument.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
pandering
advertisement
is
in
the
statute
even
in
this
context
is
to
notify
the
individual,
this
is
what
we
meant
and
not
to
have
that
individual
use
his
power
to
prohibit
somebody
from
coming
into
his
home
and
communicating
with
him
indiscriminately
and
unreasonably.
and
that
really
what
we
have
here
is
very
analogous
to
the
right
of
an
individual
has
to
turn
off
the
television
set,
to
turn
the
radio
if
he's
listening
to
a
speech
in
a
park
to
simply
walk
from
the
speech.
now,
he
is
here
using
the
post
office
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
it's
a
broad
right
to,
mr.
justice
white
of
privacy
and
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
know
that
we
have
to
find
such
a
right
existing
in
the
constitution.
i
think
if
you
take
judge
cooley's
statement
in
his
law
of
torts,
simply
the
right
to
be
let
alone
as
a
common
law
right,
not
necessarily
a
constitutional
right
or
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggested
in
griswold
against
connecticut,
that
if
the
right
itself
emanates
hope
from
the
totality
of
constitutional
scheme
under
which
we
live,
i
think
nevertheless
it
has
become
more
and
more
important
in
our
society
that
we
recognize
a
right
simply
to
let
alone.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
absolutely.
i
think
he
has
the
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it's
the
right
--
the
right
certainly
--
the
right
to
receive
is
just
as
important
as
the
right
to
communicate
and
has
been
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
a
corollary
certainly
of
the
right
to
receive.
at
least
in
the
in
the
mail
cases
the
right
to
receive
has
been
recognized
the
by
supreme
court
and
i
think
there
is
a
corollary
of
it
the
right
not
to
receive
and
i
think
in
this
society
that
we
live
in,
it's
as
strength
and
as
communication
becomes
more
and
more
widespread
and
the
variety
of
ideas
and
thought
in
our
culture
becomes
less
and
there's
the
population
grows
and
as
we
come
together
and
live
closer
in
cities
and
as
we
talked
about
not
only
air
and
water
pollution,
but
also
noise
pollution
that
this
right
to
be
let
alone,
his
right
that
needs
to
be
recognized
in
our
law
and
needs
to
be
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
i
think
that
certainly
is
corollary
to
the
right
to
receive
whatever
he
wants
to.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
the
compulsory
public
school
attendance,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
think
that's
right.
we
have
not
and
this
court
has
not
under
the
constitution
decided
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
close
his
eyes
or
refuse
to
hear.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
brief
case
involves
door-to-door
solicitation
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
hollick
case
involved
the
--
again,
this
was
not
in
this
case
the
hollick
case
that
at
the
bus
company
and
did
have
the
right
pursuant
to
district
of
columbia
ordinance
to
play
music
on
the
bus
and
the
right
of
privacy
did
not
refer
to
the
people
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
were
--
we're
dealing
with
these
kinds
of
rights,
we
have
to
be
careful
to
delineate
each
one
for
discussing
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
clearly
the
right
to
receive
has
a
corollary
of
a
right
to
turn
off
unwanted
material
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
statute.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right
it's
the
states
which
have
laws
which
provide
that
of
age
of
16
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that
is
--
there
is
no
constitutional
right
that
--
or
constitutional
mandate
that
people
have
to
go
to
school
up
until
a
certain
age.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
this
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
parent
the
right
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
the
principle
itself
is
it
has
to
be
delineated
on
case-by-case
basis,
but
i
think
the
principle
itself
as
suggested
in
the
amicus
brief
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
only
the
right
control
knowledge
about
oneself
is
and
will
become
a
considerably
broader
concept
and
the
way
they
would
attempt
to
limit
it
in
that
case.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
amendment
provision
itself
is
concerned,
i
think
that
we
have
a
basic
distinction
in
what
the
congress
sought
to
do
in
this
statute
and
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
that
have
been
upheld
in
previous
mail
cases
and
the
previous
cases
in
this
court.
and
that
is
that
here,
where
individual
decides
he
wants
no
further
communication
from
a
mailer,
his
decision
affects
only
himself
and
i
think
this
is
the
prism
through
which
the
first
amendment
claim
here
has
to
be
viewed.
in
all
other
cases,
where
an
individual,
or
an
agency,
or
a
governmental
unit
decided
that
they
did
not
like
what
was
being
communicated,
their
attempt
to
stop
the
communication
did
not
affect
even
a
single
individual
or
the
majority,
it
affected
everyone
and
that
there
is
a
great
distinction
between
this
case
and
those
kind
of
cases.
we're
not
talking
about
a
case
where
the
post
master
general
would
say,
you
can't
send
anymore
mail
through
the
--
or
anymore
of
this
kind
of
material
or
magazines,
or
books
through
the
mail
to
anyone.
now,
he
simply
saying
this
individual
in
the
society
has
told
me,
i
don't
want
to
be
communicated
from
the
sender
anymore
and
he
is
notifying
the
sender
of
that
individual's
desire.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sender's
right
to
communicate
to
everyone
else
within
the
society.”
if
you're
talking
about
a
chill
on
the
first
amendment
rights,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anyone
else
has
been
inhibited
from
receiving
of
that
material
if
that's
their
desire
and
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
there's
any
change
in
the
material
that
is
being
send
out,
it
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
is
being
distributed.
and
i
think
about
the
same
token
in
the
bynum
books
case
where
we
have
a
censorship
board,
where
what
the
censorship
board
did
to
an
individual
book
distributors
in
rhode
island
is
now
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here,
because
it's
then
affected
everyone
and
here
it
only
affects
an
individual.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
the
difficulties
in
the
other
cases
is
that
decision
of
a
majority
or
a
single
could
affect
what
every
man
wanted
to
receive
and
that
situation
does
not
happen
it
here.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
simply
turning
off
speech
and
as
has
been
suggested,
i
think
that
the
right
to
receive
has
the
corollary
right
of
not
to
receive.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
see
any
distinction
because
i
believe
that
the
individual
obviously
has
this
right
and
he
can't
turn
off
the
mail
without
some
assistance
from
the
post
master.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
that
claim
of
expense
is
there
because
in
the
past
there
was
no
concern
as
far
as
the
senders
were
concern
about
the
sensibilities
of
the
addressees.
and
what
congress
said,
is
this
going
to
have
to
have
to
be
a
cost
of
your
business.
when
an
addressee
is
offended
by
material
that
you
send
him
he
has
the
right
to
tell
you
not
to
send
him
anymore?
and
then
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it's
right
but
the
only
reason
the
government
is
not
implicated
as
a
sensor
or
has
an
inhibitor
or
prohibiter
of
first
amendment
rights,
they're
implicated
simply
because
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
turned
off
and
that
what
congress
has
done
in
any
implicating
government
and
i
agree
that's
why
i
agree
with
you
that
is
why
it
is
here
--
is
simply
used
him
as
the
hand
that
turns
off
the
radio
and
television.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
he
could
maybe
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
see
your
point,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
think
that's
what
was
congress'
point
that
the
cost
involved
is
simply
a
recognition
that
he
has
to
give
to
the
sensibilities
of
the
recipient
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
should
render
this
statute
with
any
constitutional
difficulty.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
great
deal
of
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
congressional
record
and
then
in
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
this
is
obviously
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
get
at.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
is
what
these
plaintiffs
or
appellants
here
were
doing
or
the
direct
mail
orders.
as
congressman
waldie,
i
think
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house,
the
man
who
gave
the
shape
to
this
present
statute,
he
said,
i
am
the
supreme
court
in
the
particular
household
in
which
my
children
reside,
and
from
my
decision
there
is
no
appeal.
and
i
would
take
it
that
this
is
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
do.
to
say
that
a
man
in
his
own
home
can
refuse
to
receive
material
because
it
might
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
his
children
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
this
was
his
decision
in
his
own
home
and
there
is
--
and
that
legislative
history
is
replete
with
this
kind
of
testimony.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
what
kind
of
an
order,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
reprint
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
under
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
individual
himself
in
his
sole
discretion.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
black,
the
statute
as
we
have
discussed,
i
think
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
can
be
said
to
be
ambiguous.
the
court
below
seem
to
read
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
what
section
(a)
of
the
statute
says,
mr.
justice
black.
it
also
says
in
section
(c)
of
the
statute,
the
order
of
post
master
general
shall
expressly
prohibit
the
sender
and
his
agents
or
assigns
from
making
any
further
mailings
to
the
designated
addressee.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
any
mailings,
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
any
further
mailings,
whatsoever,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
(a)
can
only
be
understood
if
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
and
i
think
the
post
master
general
is
equally
concerned
about
having
that
onus
upon
his
shoulders
and
he
in
the
administrative
pamphlet
which
has
been
put
out
in
the
order
that
sense
out,
he
sees
this
statute
as
meaning
precisely
what
congress
itself
saw
its
meaning
and
that
is
that
he
had
no
discretion
to
determine
what
was,
and
what
was
not
a
pandering?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
mean
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because,
mr.
justice
black,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
isn't
what
they
trying
to
do.
they
tried
to
do
two
things.
they
tried
to
give
the
individual
the
right
to
decide
in
his
own
discretion,
what
was
and
what
was
not
pandering
or
what
was
sexually
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
you
read
section
(a)
as
having
pandering
advertisement
being
modified
also
by
in
his
sole
discretion
and
which
--
in
a
way
in
which
it
can
be
read,
it
is
clear
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
so,
legislative
history
shows
that
it's
clear,
this
is
what
the
congress
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
reason
they
did
not
want
to
do
that
was
because
there
is
a
lot
of
controversy
within
congress
over
the
merits
or
demerits
of
so-called
junk
mail.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
they
did
--
the
evil,
at
which
congress
was
attempting
to
direct
itself,
was
the
mailing
into
the
individual's
home
of
material
that
was
pornographic,
or
was
obscene,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
and
congress
had
a
second
purpose
which
was
to
get
the
administrative
branch
and
the
courts
out
of
the
business
of
making
this
determination.
and
therefore,
they
put
pandering
advertisement
in
the
statute
and
left
it
to
the
sole
discretion
of
the
individual
to
decide
it.
hoping
that
not
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
section
(a)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
this
is
not
the
post
master
general's
interpretation.
it
is
not
our
interpretation.
we
don't
believe
it's
what
the
congress
intended
from
the
legislative
history,
and
i
think
the
statute
can
be
rationally
read
as
meaning
that
all
further
mail
was
to
be
prohibited
and
that
only
discretion
that
the
post
master
general
had
was
to
decide,
whether
there
had
been
a
mailing
that
was
objected
to
by
an
addressee,
that
was
an
advertisement.
and
then
what
he
sends
this
information
back
to
the
sender
and
says,
“no
further
mailings
are
to
be
sent”
which
is
precisely
what
his
order
says
as
reprinted
at
the
back
of
appellant;s
opening
brief.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
it
says,
no
further
mailings,
whatsoever,
not
any
similar
mailings.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas
because
the
alternative
was
to
make
the
sender
decide
what
was
pandering,
have
that
decision
reviewed
by
the
administrative
branch
and
then
again,
reviewed
by
courts
and
the
congress
saw
that
is
getting
his
right
back
into
the
problem
that
existed
before.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
i
think
he
can
decide
that
very
easily.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
i
think
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
because
of
the
obvious
difficulties
in
deciding
what
is
pandering
and
what
isn't
and
the
more
objective
standards
that
can
be
used
in
deciding,
what
is
an
advertisement?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i've
--
we
have,
i
think
discussed
in
our
brief
that
there
are
some
apparent
difficulties
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
i
think
when
you
read
section
(a)
in
conjunction
with
(b)
and
(c),
it's
clear
that
what
the
congress
intended
and
what
the
statute
says
is
any
further
mailings.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
he
is
authorized
to
request
the
attorney
general
who
is
authorized
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
the
court
will
ever
have
such
case
before
it
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
mr.
justice
white
and
if
it
does,
i
think
that
given
this
structures
of
the
statute
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
does
not.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
keep
the
courts
from
having
to
do
was
to
make
this
determination
again
in
this
instance
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
assuming
that
the
attorney
general
brought
such
a
case.
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it's
says
he's
authorized
to
bring
the
case,
it
doesn't
shall
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
but
its
way
off
on
one
end
mr.
justice
white,
in
terms
of
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
mean
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
if
there
was
an
abuse
--
of
an
obvious
abuse
of
a
lower
court's
decision
in
issuing
which
is
basically
an
equitable
proceeding
and
injunction
that
--
there
might
be
some
grounds
for
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
but
the
--
we
have
used
the
standard
in
our
brief
as
a
suggested
standard
of
a
good
faith
standard.
any
standard
that
you
use,
you
have
difficulty
with
it
because
how
can
you
determine
good
faith
to
the
addressees
not
a
present
in
court
and
he
may
will
not
be
present
in
court
if
he
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
country.
so,
that
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
a
court
would
received
one
of
these
things
that
obviously
what
wasn't
advertisement,
they
had
no
relation
whatsoever
the
pandering
our
sexually
oriented
material
that
a
court
couldn't
in
its
equity
power
refused
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
entering
an
order.
just
as
the
attorney
general
where
it
says
he's
authorized
to
bring
such
a
case
and
where
it
says,
in
the
second
stage
the
post
master
general
is
authorized
to
request
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
go
that
far.
i
think
it
may
well
be
if
it's
potatoes
that
the
court
on
the
appeal
could
it
be
said
to
have
abused
its
discretion.
