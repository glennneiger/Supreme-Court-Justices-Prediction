justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
taback,
i
gather
you
see
no
relevance
of
valentine
and
chrestensen
to
this
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
in
times
and
sullivan
opinion,
am
i
wrong,
we
made
some
references
to
indicate
that
valentine
and
chrestensen
was
not,
at
least
as
of
that
time
disapproved,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
ruckelshaus.
does
this
statute
reach
any
addressee
or
only
one's
home?
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
--
would
it
reach
for
example
mail
addressed
to
a
business
establishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
addressee
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
see
any
difficulty,
i
suppose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
of
then
if
it
was
something
just
addressed
to
general
motors
corporation,
detroit,
michigan,
and
general
motors
didn't
want
to
receive
it,
it's
not
just
to
an
individual,
just
the
general
motors
corporation,
the
statute
would
fall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ruckelshaus,
that
means
i
take
it
if
the
safeway
stores
sends
to
my
home
an
advertisement
that
we're
selling
maine
potatoes
this
week
at
$0.50
a
pack,
that
the
language
pandering
in
the
statute
is
quite
meaningless
because
in
my
subjective
judgment
that's
erotically
arousing.
the
post
office
has
to
issue
an
order
at
my
request
to
safeway
not
to
deliver
anymore
advertisements
for
the
maine
potatoes
to
my
house,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what's
the
significance
of
the
pandering
language
in
the
statute,
if
that's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
post
office
can't
say
to
me,
well,
an
advertisement
for
--
by
safeway
to
sell
maine
potatoes
is
not
something
that
under
the
statute,
you
can
refuse
to
receive
or
at
least
require
us
to
tell
safeway
not
to
send
to
your
home
anymore?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
ask
again,
what
possible
significance
is
the
attempted
limitation
of
pandering
advertisements
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
take
it
your
--
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
anybody
who
wants
to
stop
any
mail
being
sent
from
anyone
in
do
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
let's
assume
this
statute
instead
of
having
a
limitation
on
it
it
was
concerning
pandering
advertisements,
just
simply
said
that
these
procedure
was
available
whenever
an
addressee
of
mail
didn't
want
to
receive
anymore
mail
from
that
sender?

you'd
