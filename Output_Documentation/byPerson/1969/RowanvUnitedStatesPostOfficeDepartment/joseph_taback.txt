mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appeal
here
before
this
court,
is
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
of
the
united
states
district
court
with
the
central
district
of
california.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
grounded
upon
section
1253
of
the
title
28
of
united
states
codes.
the
appellants
are
in
the
mail
order
business.
they
are
distributors
and
disseminators
of
books,
pamphlets,
various
matters
and
materials
that
traffic
and
conduct
its
way
through
the
mail.
the
law
which
is
brought
here
on
focus
by
this
appeal
is
section
301
of
the
public
law
90206
or
is
codified
39
us
code
4009.
the
action
below
was
that
for
declaratory
relief
and
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement,
implementation,
and
administration
of
the
statute.
the
result
in
the
court
below
was
a
verdict
of
three
to
nothing,
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
denying
the
relief
sought.
upon
this
appeal,
it
does
seem
that
the
issues
are
made
much
clear
then
they
were
even
in
the
court
below.
this
is
come
to
be
because
a
statute
which
reportedly
was
not
an
ambiguous
has
now
received
the
same
interpretation
by
the
government
as
well
as
the
appellants
herein.
well,
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
construction
inter
--
and
the
interpretation
given
by
the
us
district
court.
this
is
a
new
twist,
if
you
will,
a
matter
which
is
occurred
at
the
time
of
this
appeal.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
say
this
is
a
matter
which
is
now
occurred
at
the
time
of
appeal.
part
of
that
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
government
and
more
particularly
at
the
time
of
their
motion
to
affirm,
attempted
to
adopt
the
view
and
interpretation
of
the
us
district
court
which
incidentally
was
by
way
of
two
votes
for
one
interpretation
and
other
vote
for
another
construction.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
government
did
take
the
view
that
they
take
here
today,
in
the
district
court.
however,
upon
examination
by
one
of
the
three
judges,
the
government
did
become
somewhat,
took
a
dual
role
if
you
will,
but
i
would
have
to
answer
that
they
did
adopt
the
view
which
they
adopt
today
in
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
would
believe
that
to
be
your
first
statement,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
taback
in
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
joseph
taback
--
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
feel
that
the
government
took
a
very
strongly
position
in
their
argument
and
therefore,
i
could
not
feel
that
it
was
an
alternative
position
per
se.
i
think
that
would
be
my
distinction.
they
were
quite
positive
in
what
this
legislation
meant.
they
were
quite
conscious
to
the
legislative
history
and
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself,
involves
the
mailing
of
materials
or
advertising
which
maybe
turned
off
by
a
recipient,
if
that
recipient
in
his
sole
discretion
determines
that
it
is
a
erotically
arousing
or
sexually
provocative.
upon
making
such
a
discretionary
determination,
the
recipient
may
obtain
a
prohibitory
order
from
the
post
office
department
issued
against
the
mailer,
his
assigns
or
his
agents.
that
order
or
the
contents
of
the
order
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
three
things
must
be
placed
in
the
order,
and
we
say
must
in
the
mandatory
sense
because
the
statute
calls
for
shall,
the
postmaster
general
shall
and
he
shall
order
the
mailer,
“do
not
mail
anything
further
to
such
a
complaining
recipient.”
he
shall
direct
the
mailer
to
remove
from
any
list
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control
or
the
under
the
control
of
his
agents
or
assigns
the
name
of
such
a
complaining
addressee.
and
thirdly,
this
order
shall
direct
the
mailer,
“do
not
sell,
transfer,
exchange
or
rent
any
list
containing
the
name
of
the
complaining
addressee.”
this
order
then
is
served
upon
the
mailer.
the
difficulty
–-
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
exhibit
a
to
the
appellant's
opening
brief
is
an
exact
order
and
it
is
the
order
arising
out
of
the
case
reference
in
the
appendix
of
lee
jay
winkler
which
appears
at
page
22
of
the
appendix
and
is
in
connection
with
the
matters
set
forth
there.
the
first
principal
problem
as
same
relates
to
the
first
amendment,
appellants
contend
that
to
repose
within
an
addressee
the
discretionary
power
to
say,
“i
do
not
want
anything
that
you
send
to
me,
any
mail,”
appellants
submit
is
a
direct
violation
and
in
complete
derogation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
is
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
principal
issues.
i
think
in
conjunction
therewith,
we
have
a
secondary
aspect
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
is
namely,
the
further
mailing
of
any
materials
which
in
that
aspect
becomes
a
prior
restraint,
it
not
only
as
prohibition
but
it
is
an
inhibition
depending
on
which
interpretation
this
court
might
involve
itself
with
or
look
at
for
the
statutory
construction.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
reached
the
sears
roebuck
catlog,
it
has
reached
the
family
heritage
bible,
it
has
reached
various
organizations
and
i
think
that
what
is
the
subject
of
one
of
the
--
on
the
amicus
briefs
here
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
certainly
is
one
of
the
principal
issues
in
this
case
and
an
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
there
are
several
of
facets.
i
believe
that
the
under
first
amendment,
the
free
expression
through
the
mails
is
of
more
paramount
right,
the
more
fundamental
right
within
the
society.
so
hence,
if
we
must
create
polarity
between
what
has
been
termed
as
the
right
of
privacy
which
i
believe
you
elude
to,
the
answer
of
appellants
is
that
the
free
speech
is
far
more
paramount
and
must
override
that
aspect
of
the
recipient
saying,
“i
do
not
want
or
i
have
a
right
not
to
receive.”
in
addition,
we
submit
however
and
i
think
this
is
more
fundamental,
that
assuming
arguendo
that
a
recipient
does
has
have
such
a
right,
this
statute
goes
too
far,
too
fast
and
hence
we
are
never
met
by
the
issue.
i
submit
that
this
is
an
issue
created
by
the
government
in
saying
that
right
of
privacy
has
now
being
polarized
with
free
speech,
but
i
believe
that
there
are
too
many
pitfalls
before
we
arrive
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
don't
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
are
any
claims.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
latter
within
the
first
amendment.
i
believe
that
each
mode
of
communication
as
this
court
has
said,
in
a
sense
spins
upon
its
own
peculiarly
or
on
its
own
way
and
must
be
looked
at.
i
believe
in
this
complex,
urban
society
in
which
we
reside,
the
mails
are
a
very
important
vehicle.
so,
i
do
not
in
anyway
determine
which
is
the
higher
form
of
communication.
i
think
communication
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
per
se.
mr.
joseph
taback
this
particular
aspect
again
goes
back
to
the
annunciations
that
have
been
made
previously
that
each
mode
of
expression,
each
form
of
expression
rather
pivots
upon
its
own.
the
situation
of
standing
outside
of
one's
home
and
making
the
speech
has
the
element
of
a
helpless
inescapable
recipient.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
could
well
be.
there
could
well
be,
but
then
again,
there
is
always
trespass
whenever
we
have
speech
in
a
sense
there
is
always
someone
who
does
not
want
to
hear
what
the
other
person
says
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
trespass
when
they
sound
of
one's
voice
or
the
wave
lengths
bounce
off
his
ears
but
in
the
society
which
has
preferred
free
speech
that
trespass
must
give
way
to
the
greater
right
embodied
within
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
taback
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
inherit
in
that
question
would
be
--
would
have
to
be
the
concession
that
there
is
right
of
privacy
involved
at
that
juncture.
it
is
appellant's
position
that
under
this
statute
and
under
that
question,
there
is
no
right
of
privacy.
the
right
--
mr.
joseph
taback
i
would
say,
under
this
statute,
there
is
no
right.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
am
attempting
to
limit
my
answer
to
the
statute.
i
believe
the
statute
goes
too
far
in
its
encroachment
to
give
that
right
in
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
is
only
one
--
there
is
only
one
way
that
i
know
of
mr.
justice
marshall
that
a
citizen
may
prevent
the
transmission
of
third
class
mail
to
his
home
and
that
is
under
the
post
office
regulation
which
i
believe
this
39
cfr
44.1,
i
believe
i
am
quoting
it
correctly.
as
far
as
picking
and
choosing
mail
per
se
that
he
does
not
want
or
as
the
statute
does
in
its
second
aspect,
“any
mail
regardless
of
its
content,
the
second
mailing
whether
it'd
be
political,
religious
or
that
type
of
speech
which
has
been
time
honored
by
this
court,
that
a
citizen
should
not
the
right
to
exclude
without
determining
what
the
content
of
the
material
is
because
the
right
of
free
speech
is
greater.
there
is
no
right
--
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
position
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
there
never
has
been
a
right
of
privacy
or
in
the
alternative
if
i
must,
that
right
of
privacy
under
those
circumstances
in
the
face
of
a
statute
is
drawn
and
the
first
amendment
must
give
way.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
the
answer
of
judge
frankel
in
the
district
court
probably
states
it
more
eloquently.
the
distance
from
the
mailbox
to
the
ash
can
is
a
short
distance
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
because
--
mr.
joseph
taback
because
in
a
complex
society
as
we
reside
in,
certain
things
give
way.
speech
is
paramount,
speech
is
the
matrix
--
mr.
joseph
taback
paramount
virtually
to
every
right,
every
thing
we
do
within
our
society
and
it
is
within
that
framework
that
we
balance
--
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
harlan,
no
we
do
not.
we
certainly
make
throw
that
away.
no
one
can
compel
any
person
to
read
anything.
mr.
joseph
taback
yes,
we
do
mr.
justice
white,
whether
it
be
in
the
slot
and
the
door
or
a
mailbox
standing
out
on
the
street.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
there
are
several
aspects
to
that
answer.
pragmatically,
i
think
one
of
the
problems
to
be
candid
is
that
there
is
a
tremendous
burden.
there
is
an
onerous
burden
within
this
commercial
realm
of
distribution
of
removing
these
names
from
the
lists.
the
burden
was
spelled
out
in
appellant's
opening
brief
as
well
as
in
the
amicus
brief.
it
is
a
real
--
mr.
joseph
taback
it
is
a
financial
and
business
burden
that
is
only
one
facet.
mr.
joseph
taback
well,
that
is
certainly
the
position
of
the
government
mr.
justice
white.
i
do
not
believe
that
commercial
communications
deserve
a
lower
rung
if
there
be
a
latter
on
the
first
amendment
than
any
other
form
of
speech.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
may
well
be
but
as
i
pre-phrase
my
answer,
there
are
several
aspects
to
that.
i
think
the
second
aspect,
probably
the
most
troublesome
aspect
of
the
statute
i
might
add,
is
a
fact
that
no
further
mailing
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
maybe
made
by
a
mailer.
regardless
of
content,
therein
lies
--
mr.
joseph
taback
the
--
if
the
statute
were
so
construed
in
spite
of
a
fact
that
the
legislative
history
is
contrary
to
that
construction
and
that
was
the
construction
of
the
court
below,
the
problem
would
become
certainly
clearer.
it
would
become
more
in
the
realm
of
constitutional
regulation,
but
i
would
then
submit
to
the
court,
that
any
type
of
regulation
of
speech
must
be
carefully
scrutinized
and
i
believe
this
particular
avenue
is
one
that
should
left
open.
mr.
joseph
taback
valentine
versus
chrestensen
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
i
just
define
and
i
review
the
matter
in
this
fashion.
one,
i
think
the
subsequent
pronouncements
of
this
court,
time
versus
hill,
times
versus
sullivan
have
swept
the
valentine
case
aside
on
reflection.
the
valentine
case
i
say
is
too
broad.
secondarily,
the
valentine
case
dealt
with
--
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
it
did
but
it
went
on
to
note
that
the
fact
of
commercialism
itself
will
not
take
speech
out
of
the
first
amendment.
secondarily,
i
believe
that
the
valentine
case
like
so
many
of
the
other
speech
regulation
cases
dealt
with
a
situation
of
the
public
streets
within
a
confines
of
local
government.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
weight
was
given
to
that
local
regulation
keeping
the
streets
open
which
is
there
as
important
in
many
senses
as
that
particular
speech
involved.
so,
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
at
this
point
burdened
by
valentine.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
and
i
do
not
because
of
this
reason.
i
believe
this
court
in
the
ginzburg
case,
addressed
itself
to
a
completely
different
problem
and
that
was
problem
of
whether
the
advertisement
connected
with
the
actual
material
could
be
used
as
evidence
in
determining
whether
the
material
itself
was
obscene.
the
connection
if
i
do
find
one,
under
the
words
of
several
of
the
justices
on
this
court
said,
“that
possibly
pandering
statutes
could
be
created
if
they
were
ambiguous,
the
illusions
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
item
by
which
to
regulate
and
a
very
troublesome
one.”
but
again,
the
defining
of
pandering
within
that
context
as
it
was
done,
i
feel
related
only
to
this
ultimate
issue
of
whether
that
material
for
the
first
time,
could
be
used
in
discerning
and
determining
whether
the
material
itself
was
obscene.
mr.
joseph
taback
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
again
that
by
being
a
citizen
within
the
society,
he
subjects
himself
to
communication
and
certain
ordinary
living
aspects.
the
mail
is
so
basic
and
so
critical
that
that
mail
must
be
delivered.
he
chooses
not
to
read
it
--
mr.
joseph
taback
receiving
it
per
se
in
his
hands
is
not
the
crux,
reading
it
is
the
problem
and
he
always
has
that
free
choice,
unfettered
to
throw
it
in
the
ash
can.
to
keep
the
mailman
away
is
to
enclose
this
individual
off
to
create
a
situation
where
communication
will
be
--
mr.
joseph
taback
no,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
submit
that.
what
we
have
here
if
the
householder
chooses
to
take
his
individual
action
he
may
but
here
we
have
a
government
intervening,
a
government
issuing
a
prohibitory
order
in
mandatory
language
that
no
further
mail
regardless
of
content
shall
be
forwarded.
mr.
joseph
taback
an
individual
citizen,
i
think
would
have
a
great
difficulty
under
the
law
in
violating
first
amendment
rights.
however,
interaction
between
individual
citizens
may
involve
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
governmental
action
involves
itself
and
certainly
do
the
degree
or
point
unnecessary,
we
have
a
different
matter.
i
do
not
say
that
the
government
cannot
assist.
i
am
certain
that
the
government
can
certainly
constitutionally,
but
when
it
does,
this
escape
hatch
that
it
is
individual
action
or
a
personal
action
is
closed.
we
now
have
the
governmental
intrusion
and
it
must
be
viewed
far
differently
than
citizen
against
citizen.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
the
government
can
assist
if
it
can
constitutionally
do
it,
yes.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
the
government
can
do
it.
i
don't
think
they
have
done
it
constitutionally
in
this
situation
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
to
this
point
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
disagree
for
the
following
reasons.
it
is
the
government
that
issues
the
prohibitory
order.
it
is
the
government
who
lays
down
what
cannot
be
done.
it
is
the
government
that
picks
up
the
schedule
for
a
second
hearing
in
the
event
of
the
second
mailing
regardless
of
content.
it
is
the
government
that
conducts
that
hearing.
it
is
the
government
who
had
set
down
the
rules
and
regulations
for
conduct
about
the
hearing
and
it
is
the
government
who
will
enforce.
mr.
joseph
taback
indeed,
and
i
think
when
we
begin
to
swift
according
to
word
of
this
court,
we
find
that
there
is
much
governmental
action
and
therefore
it
does
become
a
governmental
intrusion.
it
is
the
government
who
empowered
and
directed
if
they
so
find
to
sentence
or
cite
the
individual
for
contempt.
we
start
off
with
what
an
individual
triggering
but
the
involvement,
the
participation
is
governmental
participation
as
with
the
--
mr.
joseph
taback
under
this
statute
and
within
this
context,
i
submit
it
is
not.
one
of
the
more
telling
points
with
regard
to
this
again
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
reports
of
the
committee
before
the
senate
and
house
as
to
what
the
statute
meant.
i
emphasize
again,
that
the
congressmen
involved,
senators
in
hearing
the
matter
clearly
demonstrated
that
they
wanted
no
administrative
participation
or
as
little
as
possible.
no
judicial
review
and
in
fact
within
the
statute,
they
eliminate
judicial
review
and
they
remove
the
matter
from
the
administrative
procedure
act.
people
testifying
before
the
senate,
former
attorney
general
questioned
its
constitutionality.
general
counsel
for
post
office
asked
that
the
statute
not
be
passed.
the
american
mailers'
association,
the
american
publicists'
association,
the
list
goes
on
all
asking
of
the
matter
not
be
passed,
including
the
american
bar
association
pleading
that
we
are
retrograding,
we
are
going
back
towards
by
removing
a
procedure
so
critical
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
statute
was
passed.
it
was
clear
that
the
sole
discretion
of
the
individual
was
to
be
the
target.
mr.
joseph
taback
the
american
bar
association
took
a
primary
and
i
believe,
singular
position
with
only
with
regard
to
the
procedural
aspects,
and
that
was
the
fact
what
had
been
removed
from
the
administrative
procedures
act.
the
legislative
history
again
clearly
calls
for
what
the
government
interprets
the
statute
to
be.
the
individual
is
to
reign
free,
it
is
his
discretion
and
we
are
somewhat
surprised
to
find
that
the
government
retreats
to
a
position
if
in
fact
they
cannot
save
of
the
constitutionality
by
its
interpretation
to
appoint
--
let
us,
then
examine
and
review
the
addressee,
let
us
determine
whether
he
has
acted
in
good
faith.
this
flies
in
a
face
of
the
governmental
or
the
legislative
history
and
intent.
time
is
splitting
and
at
this
juncture
i
merely
wish
to
comment
and
point
to
the
court
that
the
procedures
embodied
in
the
hearing
that
is
involved
in
the
statute
falls
of
a
far
distance
from
the
fifth
amendment.
there
is
no
right
to
confront
your
complainant.
there
is
no
adversary
procedure
and
constitutional
issues
cannot
be
raised.
i
have
attempted
on
numerous
occasions,
it
is
a
subject
of
an
affidavit
within
the
appendix
starting
at
page
22
and
all
affidavits,
the
record
below
were
un-controverted,
nothing
was
forwarded,
nothing
came
in
contravention
to
those
affidavits.
one
comment,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
direct
mail
advertising
association
clearly
says
that,
unless
you
can
interpret
this
matter
our
way
which
is
namely
a
finding
or
administrative
procedure
ex
parte,
if
you
will,
that
the
material
is
pandering,
the
law
is
too
broad,
it
is
too
sweeping.
the
court
below
“judge
hufstedler
said,
we
can
only
salvage
the
statute
by
meticulously
construing
it
and
shrinking
it
down
to
constitutional
size
and
the
interpretation
given
by
that
court
below
in
salvaging
is
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
and
hence
it
must
fall.
it
is
contrary
to
the
appellants
view.”
it
was
clearly
the
view
of
congress
that
this
matter
be
a
subjective
determination
unfettered
and
uncontrolled
and
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment
this
cannot
go
in
that
fashion.
the
right
of
privacy,
one
the
last
note
on
that,
has
always
or
more
traditionally
involved
the
government
attempting
to
discover
something
about
some
one
else.
we
do
not
have
it
here.
we
have
merely
an
envelop
going
to
someone.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
exhibit
d
attached
to
the
affidavit
filed
at
page
22
of
the
appendix
which
entered
into
the
evidence
and
was
un-controverted,
a
notice
to
a
recipient
that
if
you
do
want
this
just
hand
it
back
to
your
postmaster.
this
is
what
has
been
done
and
yet
the
statute
went
far
a
field
and
found
it
necessary
to
build
in
a
contempt
proceeding
ultimate
jail
sentence
if
necessary
and
we
say
taking
the
entire
matter
together,
like
it's
--
if
will
assist
your
statutes
4008,
4006
is
as
unconstitutional
as
those
prior
statutes.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
is
a
method
by
which
it
can
be
taken
off
the
list
at
a
more
reduced
cost
and
this
is
what
we
mean,
mr.
justice
marshall.
if
the
envelope
with
the
label
is
returned,
there
is
a
better
chance
of
doing
it
because
the
label
usually
in
commercial
distribution
has
a
code.
the
lists
themselves
are
not
alphabetized,
there
is
no
way
to
go
through
to
the
a's
or
b's.
if
you
have
the
coded
label
at
least
you
are
given
a
reference
point
to
a
commercial
mailing
list.
without
that
envelope,
without
that
label,
there
is
undue
and
owner
is
a
burden
in
shifting
through
a
100,000
or
200,000
names
that
may
pass
from
mail
--
mr.
joseph
taback
we
would
certainly
assist.
mr.
joseph
taback
it
would
assist,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
not
create
a
burden.
it
would
help
and
reduce
the
cost
and
burden.
it
would
not
eliminate
it
completely.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
burden
that
is
unwarranted.
i
think,
we
think
we
are
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
right
and
if
that
to
be
burden
the
shift
of
the
burden
should
be
in
that
direction
as
opposed
to
a
failure
or
inability
mail
in
any
sense.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appeal
here
before
this
court,
is
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
of
the
united
states
district
court
with
the
central
district
of
california.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
grounded
upon
section
1253
of
the
title
28
of
united
states
codes.
the
appellants
are
in
the
mail
order
business.
they
are
distributors
and
disseminators
of
books,
pamphlets,
various
matters
and
materials
that
traffic
and
conduct
its
way
through
the
mail.
the
law
which
is
brought
here
on
focus
by
this
appeal
is
section
301
of
the
public
law
90206
or
is
codified
39
us
code
4009.
the
action
below
was
that
for
declaratory
relief
and
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement,
implementation,
and
administration
of
the
statute.
the
result
in
the
court
below
was
a
verdict
of
three
to
nothing,
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
denying
the
relief
sought.
upon
this
appeal,
it
does
seem
that
the
issues
are
made
much
clear
then
they
were
even
in
the
court
below.
this
is
come
to
be
because
a
statute
which
reportedly
was
not
an
ambiguous
has
now
received
the
same
interpretation
by
the
government
as
well
as
the
appellants
herein.
well,
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
construction
inter
--
and
the
interpretation
given
by
the
us
district
court.
this
is
a
new
twist,
if
you
will,
a
matter
which
is
occurred
at
the
time
of
this
appeal.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
say
this
is
a
matter
which
is
now
occurred
at
the
time
of
appeal.
part
of
that
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
government
and
more
particularly
at
the
time
of
their
motion
to
affirm,
attempted
to
adopt
the
view
and
interpretation
of
the
us
district
court
which
incidentally
was
by
way
of
two
votes
for
one
interpretation
and
other
vote
for
another
construction.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
government
did
take
the
view
that
they
take
here
today,
in
the
district
court.
however,
upon
examination
by
one
of
the
three
judges,
the
government
did
become
somewhat,
took
a
dual
role
if
you
will,
but
i
would
have
to
answer
that
they
did
adopt
the
view
which
they
adopt
today
in
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
would
believe
that
to
be
your
first
statement,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
taback
in
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
joseph
taback
--
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
feel
that
the
government
took
a
very
strongly
position
in
their
argument
and
therefore,
i
could
not
feel
that
it
was
an
alternative
position
per
se.
i
think
that
would
be
my
distinction.
they
were
quite
positive
in
what
this
legislation
meant.
they
were
quite
conscious
to
the
legislative
history
and
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself,
involves
the
mailing
of
materials
or
advertising
which
maybe
turned
off
by
a
recipient,
if
that
recipient
in
his
sole
discretion
determines
that
it
is
a
erotically
arousing
or
sexually
provocative.
upon
making
such
a
discretionary
determination,
the
recipient
may
obtain
a
prohibitory
order
from
the
post
office
department
issued
against
the
mailer,
his
assigns
or
his
agents.
that
order
or
the
contents
of
the
order
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
three
things
must
be
placed
in
the
order,
and
we
say
must
in
the
mandatory
sense
because
the
statute
calls
for
shall,
the
postmaster
general
shall
and
he
shall
order
the
mailer,
“do
not
mail
anything
further
to
such
a
complaining
recipient.”
he
shall
direct
the
mailer
to
remove
from
any
list
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control
or
the
under
the
control
of
his
agents
or
assigns
the
name
of
such
a
complaining
addressee.
and
thirdly,
this
order
shall
direct
the
mailer,
“do
not
sell,
transfer,
exchange
or
rent
any
list
containing
the
name
of
the
complaining
addressee.”
this
order
then
is
served
upon
the
mailer.
the
difficulty
–-
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
exhibit
a
to
the
appellant's
opening
brief
is
an
exact
order
and
it
is
the
order
arising
out
of
the
case
reference
in
the
appendix
of
lee
jay
winkler
which
appears
at
page
22
of
the
appendix
and
is
in
connection
with
the
matters
set
forth
there.
the
first
principal
problem
as
same
relates
to
the
first
amendment,
appellants
contend
that
to
repose
within
an
addressee
the
discretionary
power
to
say,
“i
do
not
want
anything
that
you
send
to
me,
any
mail,”
appellants
submit
is
a
direct
violation
and
in
complete
derogation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
is
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
principal
issues.
i
think
in
conjunction
therewith,
we
have
a
secondary
aspect
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
is
namely,
the
further
mailing
of
any
materials
which
in
that
aspect
becomes
a
prior
restraint,
it
not
only
as
prohibition
but
it
is
an
inhibition
depending
on
which
interpretation
this
court
might
involve
itself
with
or
look
at
for
the
statutory
construction.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
reached
the
sears
roebuck
catlog,
it
has
reached
the
family
heritage
bible,
it
has
reached
various
organizations
and
i
think
that
what
is
the
subject
of
one
of
the
--
on
the
amicus
briefs
here
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
certainly
is
one
of
the
principal
issues
in
this
case
and
an
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
there
are
several
of
facets.
i
believe
that
the
under
first
amendment,
the
free
expression
through
the
mails
is
of
more
paramount
right,
the
more
fundamental
right
within
the
society.
so
hence,
if
we
must
create
polarity
between
what
has
been
termed
as
the
right
of
privacy
which
i
believe
you
elude
to,
the
answer
of
appellants
is
that
the
free
speech
is
far
more
paramount
and
must
override
that
aspect
of
the
recipient
saying,
“i
do
not
want
or
i
have
a
right
not
to
receive.”
in
addition,
we
submit
however
and
i
think
this
is
more
fundamental,
that
assuming
arguendo
that
a
recipient
does
has
have
such
a
right,
this
statute
goes
too
far,
too
fast
and
hence
we
are
never
met
by
the
issue.
i
submit
that
this
is
an
issue
created
by
the
government
in
saying
that
right
of
privacy
has
now
being
polarized
with
free
speech,
but
i
believe
that
there
are
too
many
pitfalls
before
we
arrive
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
don't
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
are
any
claims.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
latter
within
the
first
amendment.
i
believe
that
each
mode
of
communication
as
this
court
has
said,
in
a
sense
spins
upon
its
own
peculiarly
or
on
its
own
way
and
must
be
looked
at.
i
believe
in
this
complex,
urban
society
in
which
we
reside,
the
mails
are
a
very
important
vehicle.
so,
i
do
not
in
anyway
determine
which
is
the
higher
form
of
communication.
i
think
communication
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
per
se.
mr.
joseph
taback
this
particular
aspect
again
goes
back
to
the
annunciations
that
have
been
made
previously
that
each
mode
of
expression,
each
form
of
expression
rather
pivots
upon
its
own.
the
situation
of
standing
outside
of
one's
home
and
making
the
speech
has
the
element
of
a
helpless
inescapable
recipient.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
could
well
be.
there
could
well
be,
but
then
again,
there
is
always
trespass
whenever
we
have
speech
in
a
sense
there
is
always
someone
who
does
not
want
to
hear
what
the
other
person
says
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
trespass
when
they
sound
of
one's
voice
or
the
wave
lengths
bounce
off
his
ears
but
in
the
society
which
has
preferred
free
speech
that
trespass
must
give
way
to
the
greater
right
embodied
within
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
taback
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
inherit
in
that
question
would
be
--
would
have
to
be
the
concession
that
there
is
right
of
privacy
involved
at
that
juncture.
it
is
appellant's
position
that
under
this
statute
and
under
that
question,
there
is
no
right
of
privacy.
the
right
--
mr.
joseph
taback
i
would
say,
under
this
statute,
there
is
no
right.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
am
attempting
to
limit
my
answer
to
the
statute.
i
believe
the
statute
goes
too
far
in
its
encroachment
to
give
that
right
in
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
is
only
one
--
there
is
only
one
way
that
i
know
of
mr.
justice
marshall
that
a
citizen
may
prevent
the
transmission
of
third
class
mail
to
his
home
and
that
is
under
the
post
office
regulation
which
i
believe
this
39
cfr
44.1,
i
believe
i
am
quoting
it
correctly.
as
far
as
picking
and
choosing
mail
per
se
that
he
does
not
want
or
as
the
statute
does
in
its
second
aspect,
“any
mail
regardless
of
its
content,
the
second
mailing
whether
it'd
be
political,
religious
or
that
type
of
speech
which
has
been
time
honored
by
this
court,
that
a
citizen
should
not
the
right
to
exclude
without
determining
what
the
content
of
the
material
is
because
the
right
of
free
speech
is
greater.
there
is
no
right
--
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
position
is
that
under
these
circumstances,
there
never
has
been
a
right
of
privacy
or
in
the
alternative
if
i
must,
that
right
of
privacy
under
those
circumstances
in
the
face
of
a
statute
is
drawn
and
the
first
amendment
must
give
way.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
the
answer
of
judge
frankel
in
the
district
court
probably
states
it
more
eloquently.
the
distance
from
the
mailbox
to
the
ash
can
is
a
short
distance
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
because
--
mr.
joseph
taback
because
in
a
complex
society
as
we
reside
in,
certain
things
give
way.
speech
is
paramount,
speech
is
the
matrix
--
mr.
joseph
taback
paramount
virtually
to
every
right,
every
thing
we
do
within
our
society
and
it
is
within
that
framework
that
we
balance
--
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
justice
harlan,
no
we
do
not.
we
certainly
make
throw
that
away.
no
one
can
compel
any
person
to
read
anything.
mr.
joseph
taback
yes,
we
do
mr.
justice
white,
whether
it
be
in
the
slot
and
the
door
or
a
mailbox
standing
out
on
the
street.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
there
are
several
aspects
to
that
answer.
pragmatically,
i
think
one
of
the
problems
to
be
candid
is
that
there
is
a
tremendous
burden.
there
is
an
onerous
burden
within
this
commercial
realm
of
distribution
of
removing
these
names
from
the
lists.
the
burden
was
spelled
out
in
appellant's
opening
brief
as
well
as
in
the
amicus
brief.
it
is
a
real
--
mr.
joseph
taback
it
is
a
financial
and
business
burden
that
is
only
one
facet.
mr.
joseph
taback
well,
that
is
certainly
the
position
of
the
government
mr.
justice
white.
i
do
not
believe
that
commercial
communications
deserve
a
lower
rung
if
there
be
a
latter
on
the
first
amendment
than
any
other
form
of
speech.
mr.
joseph
taback
that
may
well
be
but
as
i
pre-phrase
my
answer,
there
are
several
aspects
to
that.
i
think
the
second
aspect,
probably
the
most
troublesome
aspect
of
the
statute
i
might
add,
is
a
fact
that
no
further
mailing
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
maybe
made
by
a
mailer.
regardless
of
content,
therein
lies
--
mr.
joseph
taback
the
--
if
the
statute
were
so
construed
in
spite
of
a
fact
that
the
legislative
history
is
contrary
to
that
construction
and
that
was
the
construction
of
the
court
below,
the
problem
would
become
certainly
clearer.
it
would
become
more
in
the
realm
of
constitutional
regulation,
but
i
would
then
submit
to
the
court,
that
any
type
of
regulation
of
speech
must
be
carefully
scrutinized
and
i
believe
this
particular
avenue
is
one
that
should
left
open.
mr.
joseph
taback
valentine
versus
chrestensen
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
i
just
define
and
i
review
the
matter
in
this
fashion.
one,
i
think
the
subsequent
pronouncements
of
this
court,
time
versus
hill,
times
versus
sullivan
have
swept
the
valentine
case
aside
on
reflection.
the
valentine
case
i
say
is
too
broad.
secondarily,
the
valentine
case
dealt
with
--
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
it
did
but
it
went
on
to
note
that
the
fact
of
commercialism
itself
will
not
take
speech
out
of
the
first
amendment.
secondarily,
i
believe
that
the
valentine
case
like
so
many
of
the
other
speech
regulation
cases
dealt
with
a
situation
of
the
public
streets
within
a
confines
of
local
government.
i
think
under
these
circumstances
weight
was
given
to
that
local
regulation
keeping
the
streets
open
which
is
there
as
important
in
many
senses
as
that
particular
speech
involved.
so,
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
at
this
point
burdened
by
valentine.
mr.
joseph
taback
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
and
i
do
not
because
of
this
reason.
i
believe
this
court
in
the
ginzburg
case,
addressed
itself
to
a
completely
different
problem
and
that
was
problem
of
whether
the
advertisement
connected
with
the
actual
material
could
be
used
as
evidence
in
determining
whether
the
material
itself
was
obscene.
the
connection
if
i
do
find
one,
under
the
words
of
several
of
the
justices
on
this
court
said,
“that
possibly
pandering
statutes
could
be
created
if
they
were
ambiguous,
the
illusions
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
item
by
which
to
regulate
and
a
very
troublesome
one.”
but
again,
the
defining
of
pandering
within
that
context
as
it
was
done,
i
feel
related
only
to
this
ultimate
issue
of
whether
that
material
for
the
first
time,
could
be
used
in
discerning
and
determining
whether
the
material
itself
was
obscene.
mr.
joseph
taback
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
again
that
by
being
a
citizen
within
the
society,
he
subjects
himself
to
communication
and
certain
ordinary
living
aspects.
the
mail
is
so
basic
and
so
critical
that
that
mail
must
be
delivered.
he
chooses
not
to
read
it
--
mr.
joseph
taback
receiving
it
per
se
in
his
hands
is
not
the
crux,
reading
it
is
the
problem
and
he
always
has
that
free
choice,
unfettered
to
throw
it
in
the
ash
can.
to
keep
the
mailman
away
is
to
enclose
this
individual
off
to
create
a
situation
where
communication
will
be
--
mr.
joseph
taback
no,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
submit
that.
what
we
have
here
if
the
householder
chooses
to
take
his
individual
action
he
may
but
here
we
have
a
government
intervening,
a
government
issuing
a
prohibitory
order
in
mandatory
language
that
no
further
mail
regardless
of
content
shall
be
forwarded.
mr.
joseph
taback
an
individual
citizen,
i
think
would
have
a
great
difficulty
under
the
law
in
violating
first
amendment
rights.
however,
interaction
between
individual
citizens
may
involve
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joseph
taback
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
governmental
action
involves
itself
and
certainly
do
the
degree
or
point
unnecessary,
we
have
a
different
matter.
i
do
not
say
that
the
government
cannot
assist.
i
am
certain
that
the
government
can
certainly
constitutionally,
but
when
it
does,
this
escape
hatch
that
it
is
individual
action
or
a
personal
action
is
closed.
we
now
have
the
governmental
intrusion
and
it
must
be
viewed
far
differently
than
citizen
against
citizen.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
believe
the
government
can
assist
if
it
can
constitutionally
do
it,
yes.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
think
the
government
can
do
it.
i
don't
think
they
have
done
it
constitutionally
in
this
situation
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
taback
to
this
point
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
disagree
for
the
following
reasons.
it
is
the
government
that
issues
the
prohibitory
order.
it
is
the
government
who
lays
down
what
cannot
be
done.
it
is
the
government
that
picks
up
the
schedule
for
a
second
hearing
in
the
event
of
the
second
mailing
regardless
of
content.
it
is
the
government
that
conducts
that
hearing.
it
is
the
government
who
had
set
down
the
rules
and
regulations
for
conduct
about
the
hearing
and
it
is
the
government
who
will
enforce.
mr.
joseph
taback
indeed,
and
i
think
when
we
begin
to
swift
according
to
word
of
this
court,
we
find
that
there
is
much
governmental
action
and
therefore
it
does
become
a
governmental
intrusion.
it
is
the
government
who
empowered
and
directed
if
they
so
find
to
sentence
or
cite
the
individual
for
contempt.
we
start
off
with
what
an
individual
triggering
but
the
involvement,
the
participation
is
governmental
participation
as
with
the
--
mr.
joseph
taback
under
this
statute
and
within
this
context,
i
submit
it
is
not.
one
of
the
more
telling
points
with
regard
to
this
again
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
the
reports
of
the
committee
before
the
senate
and
house
as
to
what
the
statute
meant.
i
emphasize
again,
that
the
congressmen
involved,
senators
in
hearing
the
matter
clearly
demonstrated
that
they
wanted
no
administrative
participation
or
as
little
as
possible.
no
judicial
review
and
in
fact
within
the
statute,
they
eliminate
judicial
review
and
they
remove
the
matter
from
the
administrative
procedure
act.
people
testifying
before
the
senate,
former
attorney
general
questioned
its
constitutionality.
general
counsel
for
post
office
asked
that
the
statute
not
be
passed.
the
american
mailers'
association,
the
american
publicists'
association,
the
list
goes
on
all
asking
of
the
matter
not
be
passed,
including
the
american
bar
association
pleading
that
we
are
retrograding,
we
are
going
back
towards
by
removing
a
procedure
so
critical
from
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
statute
was
passed.
it
was
clear
that
the
sole
discretion
of
the
individual
was
to
be
the
target.
mr.
joseph
taback
the
american
bar
association
took
a
primary
and
i
believe,
singular
position
with
only
with
regard
to
the
procedural
aspects,
and
that
was
the
fact
what
had
been
removed
from
the
administrative
procedures
act.
the
legislative
history
again
clearly
calls
for
what
the
government
interprets
the
statute
to
be.
the
individual
is
to
reign
free,
it
is
his
discretion
and
we
are
somewhat
surprised
to
find
that
the
government
retreats
to
a
position
if
in
fact
they
cannot
save
of
the
constitutionality
by
its
interpretation
to
appoint
--
let
us,
then
examine
and
review
the
addressee,
let
us
determine
whether
he
has
acted
in
good
faith.
this
flies
in
a
face
of
the
governmental
or
the
legislative
history
and
intent.
time
is
splitting
and
at
this
juncture
i
merely
wish
to
comment
and
point
to
the
court
that
the
procedures
embodied
in
the
hearing
that
is
involved
in
the
statute
falls
of
a
far
distance
from
the
fifth
amendment.
there
is
no
right
to
confront
your
complainant.
there
is
no
adversary
procedure
and
constitutional
issues
cannot
be
raised.
i
have
attempted
on
numerous
occasions,
it
is
a
subject
of
an
affidavit
within
the
appendix
starting
at
page
22
and
all
affidavits,
the
record
below
were
un-controverted,
nothing
was
forwarded,
nothing
came
in
contravention
to
those
affidavits.
one
comment,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
direct
mail
advertising
association
clearly
says
that,
unless
you
can
interpret
this
matter
our
way
which
is
namely
a
finding
or
administrative
procedure
ex
parte,
if
you
will,
that
the
material
is
pandering,
the
law
is
too
broad,
it
is
too
sweeping.
the
court
below
“judge
hufstedler
said,
we
can
only
salvage
the
statute
by
meticulously
construing
it
and
shrinking
it
down
to
constitutional
size
and
the
interpretation
given
by
that
court
below
in
salvaging
is
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
and
hence
it
must
fall.
it
is
contrary
to
the
appellants
view.”
it
was
clearly
the
view
of
congress
that
this
matter
be
a
subjective
determination
unfettered
and
uncontrolled
and
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment
this
cannot
go
in
that
fashion.
the
right
of
privacy,
one
the
last
note
on
that,
has
always
or
more
traditionally
involved
the
government
attempting
to
discover
something
about
some
one
else.
we
do
not
have
it
here.
we
have
merely
an
envelop
going
to
someone.
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
exhibit
d
attached
to
the
affidavit
filed
at
page
22
of
the
appendix
which
entered
into
the
evidence
and
was
un-controverted,
a
notice
to
a
recipient
that
if
you
do
want
this
just
hand
it
back
to
your
postmaster.
this
is
what
has
been
done
and
yet
the
statute
went
far
a
field
and
found
it
necessary
to
build
in
a
contempt
proceeding
ultimate
jail
sentence
if
necessary
and
we
say
taking
the
entire
matter
together,
like
it's
--
if
will
assist
your
statutes
4008,
4006
is
as
unconstitutional
as
those
prior
statutes.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
taback
there
is
a
method
by
which
it
can
be
taken
off
the
list
at
a
more
reduced
cost
and
this
is
what
we
mean,
mr.
justice
marshall.
if
the
envelope
with
the
label
is
returned,
there
is
a
better
chance
of
doing
it
because
the
label
usually
in
commercial
distribution
has
a
code.
the
lists
themselves
are
not
alphabetized,
there
is
no
way
to
go
through
to
the
a's
or
b's.
if
you
have
the
coded
label
at
least
you
are
given
a
reference
point
to
a
commercial
mailing
list.
without
that
envelope,
without
that
label,
there
is
undue
and
owner
is
a
burden
in
shifting
through
a
100,000
or
200,000
names
that
may
pass
from
mail
--
mr.
joseph
taback
we
would
certainly
assist.
mr.
joseph
taback
it
would
assist,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
not
create
a
burden.
it
would
help
and
reduce
the
cost
and
burden.
it
would
not
eliminate
it
completely.
mr.
joseph
taback
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
burden
that
is
unwarranted.
i
think,
we
think
we
are
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
right
and
if
that
to
be
burden
the
shift
of
the
burden
should
be
in
that
direction
as
opposed
to
a
failure
or
inability
mail
in
any
sense.
