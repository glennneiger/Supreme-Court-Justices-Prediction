and
why
do
you
be

i

set
it
out,
you
mean
that
if
you
don't
you
want
it?
suppose
you
--
justice

white
you
say
what
tasked
have
–
one
of
the
facets
is
financial
burden?
justice

and
if
hasn't
to
much
to

with

--
justice

well,
that
is
the
point.
this
is
the
point
right
--
certain
act
to
this
step
but
that
give
you
protecting
is
impossible
to
determine
that
had
any

not
have
to
take
name
off
rather
than
being
able
to
communicate
because
you
go
to
communicate
any
way
with
these

because
they
do
not
accept
the

let's

the

what

you

what
amendment
do
you
--
is
there
some
place
to
a
constitution
you'd
find
that
right?
justice

you
think
a

a
right
to
read

only
what
he
wants

justice

because
it's
a

right,
isn't
it?
justice

how
about

reed

if

have

people
--
justice

--
the
captive

on

justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ruckelshaus,
you
do
concede
don't
you
or
do
you
that
the
post
master
has
to
decide
before
he
issues
an
order
that
the
material
is
an
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
concede
that
he
does
have
to
decide
that?
he
has
no
authority
to
the
order
anybody
not
to
mail
based
on
a
non-advertising
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
said
--
but
here
you
have
two
words,
pandering
advertisement
and
you
say
that
post
master
general
cannot
issue
an
order
unless
it's
an
advertisement
and
so
he
has
to
decide
in
his
own
mind
whether
it's
an
advertisement.
now,
where
do
you
get
the
--
on
what
do
you
base
your
decision
that
or
argument
that
while
he
can
decide
what's
an
advertisement,
he
has
no
authority
to
decide
what's
the
pandering
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
base
it
then
just
on
the
legislative
history
rather
than
the
words
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
let's
assume
that
the
post
master
general
issues
the
order
there
are
further
mailings
of
the
same
kind
or
just
any
further
mailing
and
he
goes
into
court
for
an
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
alright
the
attorney
general
goes
into
court
for
an
order
and
on
that
hearing,
before
an
order
to
stop
mailing,
it's
clearly
proved
(a)
that
it
was
an
advertisement
alright,
but
no
man
in
his
right
mind
would
call
this
a
pandering
advertisement,
let's
assume
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
said
a
potato
advertisement
from
safeway.
now,
do
you
think
the
court
is
going
to
issue
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you're
going
to
have
--
you
would
have
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
sender
would
say,
this
is
a
pandering
advertisement
and
does
the
court
have
to
decide
whether
it's
a
pandering
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
take
the
potato
advertisement,
would
the
court
issue
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
attorney
general
doesn't
bring
it,
he's
deciding
in
his
mind
then,
that
this
is
not
a
pandering
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
some
administrative
discretion
with
that
various
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so,
i
don't
know
the
department
of
justice
is
in
the
way
off
on
one
end?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
the
district
court
when
it
asked
to
enter
that
order,
it
would
look
at
that
potato
advertisement.
it
could
issue
the
injunction
in
its
discretion
and
you're
saying
that
the
statute
apparently
would
authorize
the
district
court
to
issue
that
injunction
and
that
it
would
be
no
violation
of
the
statute
to
order
a
person
to
quit
sending
potato
advertisement.
