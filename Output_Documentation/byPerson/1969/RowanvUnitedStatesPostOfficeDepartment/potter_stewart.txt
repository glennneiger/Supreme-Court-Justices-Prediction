justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
court,
did
the
government
take
the
position
as
to
the
meaning
and
construction
of
the
statute
that
it
takes
here
or
did
invite
the
district
court
to
take
the
position
of
that
court
took?
justice
potter
stewart
but
during
the
presentation
of
the
case
the
counsel
perhaps
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing,
can
(inaudible),
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
before
this
is
an
accurate
form
in
the
back
of
the
--
of
your
opening
brief,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
cover
only
advertisements?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
it
terms
only
pandering
advertisements
which
the
addressee
believes
to
be
erotically
arousing
or
sexually
provocative,
but
as
i
understand
your
point
is
that
and
your
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
if
the
addressee,
john
smith
thinks
that
an
advertisement
from
a
furniture
store
is
a
erotic
or
sexually
arousing,
he
can
prevent
any
further
mailings
to
him
from
that
furniture
store.
it
is
absolute
none
further
discretion,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
moment
i
thought
the
obvious
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
make
him
to
sole
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
want
to
receive
any
further
mailings
from
this
sender?
justice
potter
stewart
of
whatever
nature
and
that's
the
statute
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
may
not
be
i
don't
think
you
need
to
suggest
it,
you
don't
perhaps
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
apply
that
there's
any
federal
right,
any
constitutional
general
right
to
be
let
alone.
that
generally
is
considered
to
be
a
right
to
recognize
by
the
law
of
torts
and
protected
by
state
law,
i
gather
property
rights
but
all
you
need
to
--
the
only
federal
right
involved
here,
i
should
think
in
this
aspect
to
be
your
case
is
the
first
amendment
right,
the
right
of
choice,
and
the
right
of
choosing
what
a
person
wants
to
see
or
what
he
wants
to
hear,
also
involves
his
right
to
close
his
eyes
or
to
stop
up
his
ears,
isn't
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
right
to
choose
what
you
want
to
read
or
what
you
want
you
want
to
see
involves
the
right
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
see
this.
i
don't
want
of
--
even
--
of
course
that's
what
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
am
thinking
of
a
different
one.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
the
adults
could
not
be
compelled
to
go
school
everyday
and
that
listen
to
things
teacher,
they
don't
want
to
listen
to
either,
could
they
constitutionally,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
general
there
is
a
very
great,
big
difference
though
between
turning
off
the
radio
or
television
and
writing
to
some
sender
of
mail
and
saying
please,
never
send
me
anything
again
ever
through
the
mail,
and
this
statute
because
in
the
first
examples,
the
government
is
not
implicated
whatsoever.
this
is
purely
an
individual
personal
action,
we
have
exercise
of
free
choice.
here,
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
implicated,
that's
only
reason
this
case
is
here?
if
the
people
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
court,
did
the
government
take
the
position
as
to
the
meaning
and
construction
of
the
statute
that
it
takes

or
