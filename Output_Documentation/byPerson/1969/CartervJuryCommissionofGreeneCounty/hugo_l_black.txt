justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
are
you
familiar
with
--
in
the
last
election,
how
many
colored
people
were
elected
to
county
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
greene
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
in
serving
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
offices
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
there
were
some
of
the
key
officers
of
the
county.
i
mean
by
key
officers
who
could
be
helpful
in
bringing
about
the
elimination
of
discrimination.
some
of
the
key
officers
of
the
county
were
elected
who
were
colored,
were
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
because
it
had
not
been
that
way
before.
not
before
the
recent
opinions
that
attempted
to
provide
methods
to
see
that
each
race
had
its
proper
right
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
the
court
have
black
people
as
bonus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
must
recall
that
if
they
could
--
if
we
could
take
out
of
the
state
its
power
to
select
its
officials
in
anyway
they
choose
either
by
election
or
by
appointment
that
that
would
cut
against
either
one
when
become
rules,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
say
the
courts
could
take
the
power
instead
of
the
legislative
branch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
is
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
rather
unique
thing
to
suggest
that
the
courts
of
the
nation
have
a
right
to
change
the
legislation
in
a
state
and
say
that
instead
of
having
appointments,
they
should
have
election.
it
might
be
wise,
i'm
not
saying
it
wins,
but
it
might
be
rather
unique
in
the
history
of
our
building,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
not
an
example
is
it
of
changing
the
law
in
reference
to
selection
of
officers
saying
how
this
shall
be
selected
invalidating
the
law
which
provides
to
appointment
of
certain
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[voice
overlap]
get
away
from
rules
and
semantics
because
here
we
are
up
against
a
real
practical
situation.
you
don't
see
that
if
we
were
to
hold
that
the
governor
can
not
appoint
as
the
state
law
provide
that
that
would
be
interfering
with
the
election
laws
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
through
the
core?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
an
election
law
that
he
shall
appoint,
i
mean
it's
a
selection
of
officers
that
he
shall
appoint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
wouldn't
it
invalidate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
things
to
have,
that
i
recall.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
recall
doing
to
this
extent
its
essential
vote
to
the
as
much
to
your
people
as
it
is
to
the
white
people
that
we
preserve
ancient
landmarks
for
the
government
and
not
depart
completely
from
the
idea
if
they
can
elect
their
officials
or
appoint
them
in
the
manner
of
the
right
on
law.
someone
suggested
to
me
sometime
ago
that
the
way
to
prevent
unfair
trials
in
the
south
was
to
take
defendants
from
down
there
quite
differently
and
take
them
up
in
trial
in
harlem.
and
they
did
it
honestly.
it
was
a
belief
that
that
was
the
best
way
to
do
it.
of
course
it's
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
is
the
same,
but
i
think
you
--
from
what
i
read
about
greene
county,
they've
made
it
through
members,
almost
miraculous
progress
over
there
in
the
right
to
the
people
to
vote
and
select
their
own
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
condole
that
we
took
away
from
that
state
its
right
to
appoint
jury
commissions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
demanded
it
to
be
a
governor
appoint
a
man
of
a
certain
title,
(inaudible)
a
jury
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
one
can
disagree
with
you
i
don't
think
who
lives
in
the
fair
and
equal
government
on
that
basis
that
they
are
entitled
to.
but
the
question
here,
i'm
asking
you
because
you
and
your
group
as
much
understood
in
carrying
on
the
law
fairly
administered
so
that
you
don't
break
down
the
great
structure
of
our
democratic
government
by
saying
it
to
the
courts
and
require
that
certain
people
or
members
of
the
race
be
appointed
to
office
by
the
appointed
power.
anymore
than
we
could
say
they
must
elect
them.
of
course
we
can
hold
that
they
must
adopt
policy.
i'm
not
arguing
against
your
point
that
you
do
have
a
very
righteous
cause
of
complaint
in
connection
with
that
county.
but
i
am
trying
to
point
out
that
we
have
reached
it
yet
a
point
and
made
a
miraculous,
almost
miraculous
progress,
a
man
who
lived
at
alabama
knows,
almost
the
miraculous
progress
that
has
been
made
in
greene
county
without
destroying
any
of
the
ancient
landmarks
of
the
government.
