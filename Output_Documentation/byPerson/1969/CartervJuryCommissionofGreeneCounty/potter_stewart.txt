justice
potter
stewart
but
do
your
really
think
that's
the
source
of
the
problem,
or
do
you
think
the
source
of
the
problem
is
simply
an
unreconstructed
intention
required
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
those
who
were
the
job
of
picking
juries?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
this
case,
and
i'm
just
looking
at
a
paragraph
in
your
own
brief
on
page
10
in
which
you
summarized
the
injunction
that
was
granted,
it
was
against
systematic
and
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
jury
roll
of
greene
county,
and
also
an
order
requiring
at
a
new
jury
roll
showing
the
race
and
if
available
the
age
of
each
juror
be
filed
with
the
court
within
60
days,
and
a
report
showing
the
procedure
used
in
compiling
it.
now,
isn't
that
the
way
to
get
at
this
rather
than
to
excise
a
couple
of
adjectives
from
the
statute
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
has
state
the
jury
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
governor?
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
yesterday's
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
they
were
reported
by
superior
court
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
your
suggestion
as
to
the
remedy
that
should
be
accorded
in
the
event
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
merits
of
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
amaker,
there
are
three
jury
commissioners
in
each
county?
justice
potter
stewart
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
suggestion
is
that
the
governor
of
the
state
should
be
required
to
appoint
what,
at
least
one
of
the
three,
or
two
out
of
three,
or
he
should
be
requiring
to
appoint
jury
commissioners
which
reflected
so
far
as
possible
the
percentage
of
population
of
each
county
of
that
way?
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
would
also
then
of
course
you're
saying,
it
should
also
invalidate
the
state
law
that
confers
upon
the
governor
the
power
to
appoint
jury
commissioners.
are
you
suggesting
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
there
were
no
election
then
this
would
be
in
violation
of
the
state
law
which
provides
that
the
governor
shall
appoint
the
jury
commissioner.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
you
are
suggesting
that
at
least
with
respect
to
greene
county,
the
law
of
alabama
that
converges
upon
the
governor
the
power
and
the
duty
to
appoint
jury
commissioners
is
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
the
way
to
get
out
it
is
the
way
this
district
court
got
at
it.
this
court
in
its
opinions
said
there
had
been
a
declaratory
judgment
put
down
in
1967
and
that
had
not
remedied
the
situation,
that
there
continued
to
be
recalcitrance,
and
that
now
the
time
come
for
an
injunction
and
this
court
issued
an
injunction
which
was
specific
and
stringent.
and
i
suppose
your
answer
is
that
the
way
to
get
out
it
is
the
way
this
district
court
got
at
it,
rather
than
to
enjoin
the
governor
of
the
state
as
to
who
he
should
appoint
as
jury
commissioners.
isn't
that
the
answer
to
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
going
to
do
what
--
appoint
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
injunction
been
complied
with?
i'm
referring
to
the
language
appearing
on
27
(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
said
"defendants
are
ordered
to
take
prompt
action
to
compile
a
jury
list
for
greene
county,
alabama
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
alabama
and
the
constitutional
principles
set
out
in
this
judgment.
they
are
ordered
to
file
with
this
court
within
60
days
a
jury
list
and
so
compiled."
justice
potter
stewart
that's
been
done?
justice
potter
stewart
that
of
course
wouldn't
be
i
suppose
in
the
record,
just
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
racial
designations
on
the
list,
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
on
accord
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
absence
of
some
particularized
reason,
i
suppose
the
complaint
to
be
made
of
the
fact
that
there
--
were
racial
designations.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
in
accord
with
this
injunction
this
probably
