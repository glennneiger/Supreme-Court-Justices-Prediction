mr.
norman
c.
amaker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arising
from
greene
county,
alabama
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
like
the
turner
case
heard
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session
concerning
georgia's
jury
selection
law,
the
issue
posed
is
that
of
the
constitutional
validity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
alabama
statute
which
vest
successive
discretion
in
jury
officials
in
that
state
in
the
selection
of
jurors.
our
submission
is
that
the
use
of
statutes
such
as
these
in
those
states
like
alabama
which
have
a
demonstrated
history
of
discrimination
against
black
people
in
the
jury
selection
process
is
the
major
cause
of
the
continuing
phenomenon
of
racial
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
opportunity
for
jury
service
in
state
courts.
that's
a
phenomenon
which
is
all
too
common
place
as
this
court's
experience
in
jury
discrimination
cases
for
the
past
90
years
attests.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
if
you
didn't
have
that
history
of
discrimination,
i
would
say
that
the
statute
is
susceptible
of
abuse
and
therefore,
if
a
different
kind
of
demonstrated
injury
were
made
to
appear
that
the
court
would
have
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
would
say
that
the
statute
is
vague,
lacking
in
standards,
susceptible
of
abuse.
i
would
say
that
the
court
would
knock
the
issue
of
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
would
not
be
present
because
there
would
be
no
history
of
the
application
of
the
vague
standards
to
a
situation
in
which
one
could
demonstrate
that
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
that's
not
this
case.
every
single
--
all
of
the
vagueness
cases
in
this
court,
the
free
expression
area
and
the
criminal
area
are
cases
in
which
some
litigant
came
to
the
court
and
said
that
the
cause
of
these
vague
standards
which
give
excessive
discretion
to
officials,
my
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated
and
until
a
case
of
that
kind
reaches
this
court,
and
it
reaches
this
court
in
this
case
and
in
georgia
and
it
has
not
as
for
example
in
wisconsin
or
maine,
the
kinds
of
questions
that
we
were
discussing
yesterday.
the
court
obviously
has
no
occasion
to
declare
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
but
that
has
been
the
consistent
pattern
of
litigation
and
decision
making
in
this
court.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
only
in
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
only
in
a
very
narrow
sense.
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
matter
in
which
the
jury
officials
have
used
their
discretion,
which
is
what
this
--which
is
what
the
issue
here
is
concerned
with,
then
you're
talking
about
--
then
that's
a
different
question
from
the
way
the
district
court
addressed
the
question.
they
simply
said
that
if
we
issue
an
injunction,
which
tells
these
jury
officials
that
they
are
no
longer
to
discriminate
that
that's
sufficient.
what
i
say
is
that
does
not
deal
with
the
problem
of
discretion.
that
does
not
deal
with
the
capability
for
discrimination
that
the
statute
invites,
and
therefore
the
only
way
that
you
can
deal
with
that
is
to
deal
with
the
source
of
the
problem
which
is
the
statutory
standards
itself.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
some
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
involving
discrimination
against
blacks
in
voting.
that's
what
this
court
has
done
in
all
the
vagueness
cases
that
have
come
before
it.
this
is
by
now
no
novel
doctrine
in
this
court.
you
know
in
challenging
this
case,
therefore
alabama's
jury
selection
statute,
i
stressed
of
the
outset
of
firm
belief
that
this
longstanding
problem
of
racial
discrimination
in
jury
selection
will
not
be
solved,
unless
the
court
respond
to
this
challenge
by
voiding
to
provisions
of
the
statute
involved
here
and
requiring
the
use
of
fairly
administered
objective
standards
for
determining
what
person
shall
be
listed
on
the
roles
of
perspective
juries
on
the
state.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
kind
--
one
suggestion,
i
think
it's
exemplary
only
are
kinds
that
the
congress
enacted
in
dealing
with
the
same
problem
in
the
context
of
the
federal
jury
selection
system.
after
the
key
man
system
had
been
exposed
as
an
apparatus
whereby
discrimination
was
being
practiced
against
groups
and
the
groups
involved
avail
of
principally
negroes.
in
the
federal
system,
congress
responded
to
that
challenge
by
enacting
the
jury
selection
in
service
act
of
1968.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it
--
well,
let
me
show
up
in
that
they
--
the
proposed,
there
were
two
bills.
they
were
both
part
of
the
1966
civil
rights
package.
now
the
bill
with
respect
to
federal
jury
selection
was
taken
out
and
enacted
last
year.
the
bill
that
was
proposed
in
1966
passed
the
house.
now,
they
were
in
that
--
there
was
in
that
bill,
sections
203
(a)
and
(b)
which
together
gave
to
the
district
courts
the
judgment
of
whether
they
could
require
objective
criteria
in
the
state
jury
selection
process.
so
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
response
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
federal
act
does
and
they
are
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
so
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
did
not
state
what
they
should
be.
the
federal
act
stated
the
very
simple
ones
of
age,
residency,
absence
of
a
felony
conviction
and
the
ability,
the
simple
ability
to
read
and
write
the
english
language
as
determined
again
objectively,
not
subjectively
as
determined
by
a
person's
ability
to
fill
out
a
juror
qualification
form.
now,
that
is
the
system
that
is
in
fact
in
operation
throughout
the
federal
system.
as
i
indicated
in
my
reply
brief
in
this
case,
district
courts
throughout
the
country
who
have
been
faced
with
suits
of
the
kind
that
this
is
an
affirmative
action
seeking
injunctive
relief
have
directed
or
suggested
to
state
officials
that
they
ought
to
take
a
look
at
what
the
congress
did
with
respect
to
that
federal
statute,
as
a
means
of
remedying
the
problem.
that
means
to
me
is
that
it
is
pretty
clear
that
90
years
of
litigation
and
the
repeated
admonition
to
jury
officials
that
they
must
reform
their
system
really
hasn't
worked.
and
the
only
kind
of
reform
that
is
an
essential
step
is
to
deal
with
the
source
of
the
problem
which
is
the
discretion
vesting
statutes
like
the
one
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
it's
pretty
clear
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that's
true,
but
if
the
question
that
you
have
to
ask
is
what
can
you
deal
with,
what
can
a
court
deal
with?
how
do
you
remedy
the
problem?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
don't
think
that
it's
possible
for
this
or
any
other
court
to
remedy
that
problem
by
an
injunction
which
says,
administer
the
statute
fairly.
the
court
has
done
that
consistently
for
90
years.
what
it
can
do
consistent
with
the
decisions
in
this
court
under
the
vagueness
doctrine
is
to
deal
with
the
state
enactment
which
permits
those
unreconstructed
attitudes
to
be
effective.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
that
isn't
the
way
to
get
at
it.
if
that
were
the
way
to
get
at
it,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would
not
have
the
constant
re-appearance
of
these
jury
discrimination
cases
in
this
court
and
in
courts
throughout
the
nation.
and
why
i'm
talking
about
the
nation,
i'm
talking
about
the
courts
in
that
southern
tier
states
where
the
problem
has
past
persisted.
and
just
excising
the
language
isn't
effective.
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
require
that
there
be
objective
standards.
it
doesn't
strike
neither
that
is
such
a
tremendous
problem.
now,
there
are
22
states
to
be
sure
which
have
similar
language.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
court
can
say
one
of
the
district
judges
in
cases
we've
cited
here
simply
said,
"we
suggest
to
you
that
you
use
objective
criteria
and
to
help
you,
we
refer
you
to
what
the
congress
did
in
the
jury
selection
service
act."
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
really
anything
wrong
with
the
court
indicating
what
kind
of
objective
criteria
would
be
desirable,
but
i
think
that
it's
important
for
the
court
to
indicate
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
objective
criteria.
of
the
states
in
the
union,
there
may
be
22
which
have
this
kind
of
vague
language
and
you
can
document
that
in
a
number
of
them.
it
has
been
used
and
employed
for
discriminatory
purpose,
and
that's
why
the
case
is
here
but
that
still
means
that
the
majority
of
the
states
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
operate
a
fair
jury
selection
system
by
using
language
of
this
sort.
my
own
submission
is
that
when
you
have
language
of
this
sort
and
you
put
that,
you
give
the
discretion
to
persons
who
are
then
reconstructed
in
their
attitudes
and
who
are
all
white
in
a
community
like
greene
county
which
has
a
black
majority
that
you
get
the
kind
of
results
that
are
shown
on
this
record,
and
those
results
have
been
documented
for
several
years.
there
was
a
prior
case
in
the
district
court
showing
what
happened
and
there
was
declaratory
relief
there,
that
didn't
work.
now,
when
you
issue
an
injunction
to
jury
officials,
it
was
really
telling
them
to
do
better.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
been
the
decision
making
process
in
this
court
for
decades.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
may
be
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know
about
the
case.
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
cases
which
have
come
to
this
court
and
the
cases
in
which
this
issue
has
normally
raised
are
cases
which
have
states
--
which
have
standards
like
these.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
not
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
not
all
of
them.
of
the
22
are,
i
think
there
were
seven
are
southern
states.
that's
one
out
of
three.
if
by
defining
southern
states,
you're
talking
about
11
or
12,
i
get
it.
that's
still
a
majority.
but
the
question
it
seems
to
me
is
really
not
how
many
states
are
or
not
employing
language
of
this
kind.
it's
the
abuse
creating
mechanism
that
language
of
this
kind
gives.
and
again,
i
resort
to
what
this
court
has
done
on
the
vagueness
cases
traditionally.
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
united
states
versus
louisiana
and
some
of
the
other
cases
that
we've
cited
here.
there
is
a
second
issue
that's
presented
here
and
that
is
whether
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
on
this
record,
should
be
upheld
in
refusing
what
we
think
is
an
essential
element
of
the
relief
to
which
appellants
are
entitled
in
this
county
with
its
history
of
racial
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
opportunity
for
jury
service.
that
is
the
vacation
of
the
all
white
jury
commission
of
greene
county,
alabama.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they're
appointed
by
the
governor
who
was
a
--
who's
named
at
the
complaint
as
a
defendant.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
unlike
yesterday's
case
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
--
by
the
judge,
right.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
start
from
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
had
a
record
of
discriminatory
action
of
a
long
period
of
time
taken
by
jury
officials
all
of
whom
were
white.
i
look
at
the
statement
in
louisiana
v.
united
states
which
indicates
that
the
district
court
when
dealing
with
this
problem
of
racial
discrimination
has
the
duty
to
render
a
decree
that
will
give
effective
relief.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
on
our
first
submission,
an
essential
first
step
is
to
get
rid
of
a
vague
standards
and
to
require
objective
criteria,
but
it
is
also
pretty
clear
that
there
may
well
be
a
time
lag
between
the
time
that
that
relief
becomes
effective
and
that
in
any
event,
it
is
a
practical
impossibility
to
excise
all
discretion
from
the
administration
of
laws.
on
that
basis
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
community,
the
majority
whose
citizens
--
the
vast
majority
whose
citizens
are
black,
where
you
can
demonstrate
that
white
officials
have
consistently
discriminated
and
there
is
no
easier
demonstration
to
make
than
on
this
record.
that
as
an
essential
item
of
relief,
the
district
court
in
order
to
give
the
complete
relief
to
which
the
parties
here
were
entitled
should
have
required
the
appointment
of
some
black
members
to
the
jury
commission.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
appointed
by
the
governor
for
an
indefinite
period
until
the
successor
is
appointed
by
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
go
that
far.
i
think
what
the
court
had
before
it
was
a
situation
in
greene
county.
the
district
court
could
state
as
a
matter
of
its
discretionary
relief.
it
could
state
that
at
least
one,
it
could
divide
--
it
could
perhaps
even
order
an
election
and
in
the
county
like
greene
with
now
with
the
blacks
on
the
voting
roles
and
abundance
for
the
first
time
they
put
there
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
it
was
very
probable.
it
had
some
options.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no.
well,
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
appointment
of
all
white
jury
commissioners
in
this
county
has
already
violated
the
constitution.
and
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
relief,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
district
court
stating
that
in
order
--
"because
of
that
of
that,
we
are
going
to
require
you
to,
in
this
county
at
least,
appoint
commissioners
in
a
different
way."
and
that
is,
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
state
laws
and
regulations
once
they
were
demonstrated
to
have
play
their
part
in
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
could
not
be
enjoined,
or
that
the
court
could
not
as
a
court
of
equity,
give
the
kind
of
relief
to
which
the
court
deemed
the
parties
were
entitled.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
right.
that
was
the
claim
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
the
claim
that
we
urge
here.
there
is
another
point
which
i
think
i
should
address
myself
to
that
is
the
district
court's
view
in
its
opinion
that
it
could
not
void
the
vague
statutory
standards
because
this
court
had
never
held
these
criteria
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
and
it's
cited
for
that
proposition,
cassell
versus
texas
which
is
one
of
a
group
of
five
cases
involving
the
texas
grand
jury
system
from
--
decided
in
this
court
from
1940
to
1954.
i
cited
also
an
old
1910
case
called
franklin
v.
south
carolina.
now
there
is
an
argument
addressed
to
both
of
these
in
our
brief.
the
submission
is
one
that
the
cassell
case,
in
that
case
the
issue
was
never
raised
on
the
court
without
inquiry
indicated
that
the
texas
statutory
scheme
was
alright.
the
franklin
case
it
seems
to
me
is
a
case
which
has
now
really
been
eroded
entirely
by
the
later
development
of
the
vagueness
doctrine
in
this
court
has
no
continuing
validity.
and
neither
of
these
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
used
to
prevent
the
court
from
granting
the
relief
that
we
urge
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry
as
to
what
occurred.
the
district
court
required
the
filing
of
a
report
as
indicated
in
its
opinion
within
60
days.
that
report
was
filed
in
november
of
last
year.
it
is
in
the
--
the
report
is
in
the
exhibits
that
are
on
file
on
the
clerk's
office.
i
looked
at
it
yesterday.
there
is
no
numerical
compilation,
scanning
it
in
the
case
that
there
are
approximately
50%
blacks
on
that
list.
i
don't
know
which
where
the
balance
is
tipped.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they
were
required
on
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
yes,
yes
they
are.
now,
whether
the
district
--
whether
the
jury
commissioners
will
consistently
do
that,
i
don't
know.
prior
to
that
injunction
there
were
no
racial
designations.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
that
the
particularized
reason
appear
from
these
records,
you
see.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
that
has
been
--
that
was
the
same
thing
that
congress
did
you
know,
in
the
jury
act,
and
in
both
the
jury
bills
because
the
problem
we've
had
in
these
racial
discrimination
cases
over
the
years,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
you
haven't
been
able
to
find
out
very
often
or
at
least
not
without
you'd
been
able
to
would
not
about
considerable
amount
of
difficulty
what
the
racial
breakdown
was.
now,
the
congress
recognized
that
that
it
was
important
in
order
to
demonstrate
racial
discrimination
that
what
the
numbers
were.
but
let
me
just
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
very
last
one
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
in
greene
county?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
at
least
three
or
four.
this
was
after
this
court's
decision
on
hadnott
v.
amos.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
are
about
three
or
four,
i
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
entirely
sure
what
the
offices
are
mr.
justice
black.
they
are
on
the
county
commission.
and
i
think
that's
a
three
or
four
men-commission.
they're
on
that
county
commission.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
some
blacks
elected,
yes.
and
as
a
consequence
of
after
this
court's
order
in
hadnott.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well
that
was
true
in
that
voting
context,
and
that's
really
the
cognitive.
that's
really
our
submission
--
a
part
of
the
submission
with
respect
to
the
jury
commission
that's
in
our
brief
here.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that,
you
know,
the
civil
rights
commission's
report
documented
the
alienation
of
blacks
in
--
throughout
the
south
generally
in
alabama
and
greene
county
particularly.
and
we
indicated
that
one
of
the
ways
you
cure
that
since
jury
service
is
kind
of
a
twin
of
voting
service
in
terms
of
the
general
impact
on
the
public
life
community
that
it's
extremely
important,
particularly
in
a
county
like
this
just
as
it
was
in
the
voting
situation
to
have
black
people
serving
on
the
jury
commission.
now,
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
of
course,
of
course
but
the
jury
commission
at
this
point
is
not
an
elective
office
as
a
general
proposition.
i'm
simply
saying
that
on
this
record
of
course
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
i
don't
see
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
but
i'm
not
--
the
submission
is
not
nearly
that
broad
mr.
justice
black.
in
louisiana
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
it
has
occurred
on
occasions
and
it
has
occurred
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
those
occasions.
louisiana
v.
united
states
for
example,
was
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
and
this
court
later
affirmed
a
decree
by
that
court
requiring
the
registrars
not
to
use
a
citizenship
test
which
because
of
its
discriminatory
impact
on
the
right
of
negroes
to
vote.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
last
--
and
that's
one
example,
that
was
unique.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
don't
see
that
as
an
invalidation
of
the
law
because
i
see
that
only
as
a
remedial
aspect
of
the
court's
equity
powers
once
you
have
a
demonstrated
constitutional
violation.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't
see
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it's
not
an
election
law
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
when
i
addressed
the
question
of
how
do
you
deal
with
this
terribly
intractable
problem
of
racial
discrimination
when
the
governor
has
consistently
appointed
only
white
jury
commissioners,
and
those
jury
commissioners
has
consistently
discriminated
against
blacks,
i
think
our
constitution
can
reach
that.
and
i
think
that
this
court
can
say
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy
in
this
situation
without
invalidating
that
law
as
general
proposition
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
think
if
the
invalidation
occurs,
mr.
justice
black,
it
occurs
only
to
in
those
to
use
your
term,
unique
situations
in
which
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
as
it
is
in
this
case
that
this
kind
of
wide
ranging
deep
seeded
discrimination
has
occurred.
last
year
for
example,
as
a
matter
of
remedy
with
respect
to
the
teacher
integration
in
the
montgomery
county
case,
this
court
upheld
the
decree
whereby
district
judge
decided
that
the
way
to
get
at
this
problem,
because
other
methods
had
not
solved
the
problem,
but
the
way
to
get
up
the
problem
was
to
acquire
a
mathematical
ratio
in
schools.
i'm
simply
saying
of
course
it's
a
unique
proposition,
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
when
the
constitutional
violation
is
so
bold
with
this
court
in
the
past
has
responded
with
that
kind
of
unique
relief.
and
not
simply
think
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they
haven't
made
that
progress
without
a
concerted
judicial
effort.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
litigation
after
litigation
after
litigation.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
and
this
case
is
entirely
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
if
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
it
certainly
seems
that
just
as
the
majority
of
the
citizens
in
greene
county
are
entitled
to
elect
the
persons
that
they
choose.
the
jury
commission
which
forms
a
very
important
public
function
in
the
community
is
entitled
--
they're
entitled
also
to
have
some
representation
of
their
group
from
that
commissioner.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
my
time
is
up,
mr.
justice
black.
i
can
only
say
that
that
has
taken
very,
very
many
decades
and
i
don't
--
it's
not
my
judgment
that
that
is
a
miraculous
record.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arising
from
greene
county,
alabama
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
like
the
turner
case
heard
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session
concerning
georgia's
jury
selection
law,
the
issue
posed
is
that
of
the
constitutional
validity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
alabama
statute
which
vest
successive
discretion
in
jury
officials
in
that
state
in
the
selection
of
jurors.
our
submission
is
that
the
use
of
statutes
such
as
these
in
those
states
like
alabama
which
have
a
demonstrated
history
of
discrimination
against
black
people
in
the
jury
selection
process
is
the
major
cause
of
the
continuing
phenomenon
of
racial
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
opportunity
for
jury
service
in
state
courts.
that's
a
phenomenon
which
is
all
too
common
place
as
this
court's
experience
in
jury
discrimination
cases
for
the
past
90
years
attests.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
if
you
didn't
have
that
history
of
discrimination,
i
would
say
that
the
statute
is
susceptible
of
abuse
and
therefore,
if
a
different
kind
of
demonstrated
injury
were
made
to
appear
that
the
court
would
have
to
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
would
say
that
the
statute
is
vague,
lacking
in
standards,
susceptible
of
abuse.
i
would
say
that
the
court
would
knock
the
issue
of
whether
the
statute
was
constitutional
would
not
be
present
because
there
would
be
no
history
of
the
application
of
the
vague
standards
to
a
situation
in
which
one
could
demonstrate
that
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
that's
not
this
case.
every
single
--
all
of
the
vagueness
cases
in
this
court,
the
free
expression
area
and
the
criminal
area
are
cases
in
which
some
litigant
came
to
the
court
and
said
that
the
cause
of
these
vague
standards
which
give
excessive
discretion
to
officials,
my
constitutional
rights
are
being
violated
and
until
a
case
of
that
kind
reaches
this
court,
and
it
reaches
this
court
in
this
case
and
in
georgia
and
it
has
not
as
for
example
in
wisconsin
or
maine,
the
kinds
of
questions
that
we
were
discussing
yesterday.
the
court
obviously
has
no
occasion
to
declare
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
but
that
has
been
the
consistent
pattern
of
litigation
and
decision
making
in
this
court.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
only
in
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
only
in
a
very
narrow
sense.
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
matter
in
which
the
jury
officials
have
used
their
discretion,
which
is
what
this
--which
is
what
the
issue
here
is
concerned
with,
then
you're
talking
about
--
then
that's
a
different
question
from
the
way
the
district
court
addressed
the
question.
they
simply
said
that
if
we
issue
an
injunction,
which
tells
these
jury
officials
that
they
are
no
longer
to
discriminate
that
that's
sufficient.
what
i
say
is
that
does
not
deal
with
the
problem
of
discretion.
that
does
not
deal
with
the
capability
for
discrimination
that
the
statute
invites,
and
therefore
the
only
way
that
you
can
deal
with
that
is
to
deal
with
the
source
of
the
problem
which
is
the
statutory
standards
itself.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
some
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
involving
discrimination
against
blacks
in
voting.
that's
what
this
court
has
done
in
all
the
vagueness
cases
that
have
come
before
it.
this
is
by
now
no
novel
doctrine
in
this
court.
you
know
in
challenging
this
case,
therefore
alabama's
jury
selection
statute,
i
stressed
of
the
outset
of
firm
belief
that
this
longstanding
problem
of
racial
discrimination
in
jury
selection
will
not
be
solved,
unless
the
court
respond
to
this
challenge
by
voiding
to
provisions
of
the
statute
involved
here
and
requiring
the
use
of
fairly
administered
objective
standards
for
determining
what
person
shall
be
listed
on
the
roles
of
perspective
juries
on
the
state.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
kind
--
one
suggestion,
i
think
it's
exemplary
only
are
kinds
that
the
congress
enacted
in
dealing
with
the
same
problem
in
the
context
of
the
federal
jury
selection
system.
after
the
key
man
system
had
been
exposed
as
an
apparatus
whereby
discrimination
was
being
practiced
against
groups
and
the
groups
involved
avail
of
principally
negroes.
in
the
federal
system,
congress
responded
to
that
challenge
by
enacting
the
jury
selection
in
service
act
of
1968.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it
--
well,
let
me
show
up
in
that
they
--
the
proposed,
there
were
two
bills.
they
were
both
part
of
the
1966
civil
rights
package.
now
the
bill
with
respect
to
federal
jury
selection
was
taken
out
and
enacted
last
year.
the
bill
that
was
proposed
in
1966
passed
the
house.
now,
they
were
in
that
--
there
was
in
that
bill,
sections
203
(a)
and
(b)
which
together
gave
to
the
district
courts
the
judgment
of
whether
they
could
require
objective
criteria
in
the
state
jury
selection
process.
so
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
response
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
federal
act
does
and
they
are
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
so
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
did
not
state
what
they
should
be.
the
federal
act
stated
the
very
simple
ones
of
age,
residency,
absence
of
a
felony
conviction
and
the
ability,
the
simple
ability
to
read
and
write
the
english
language
as
determined
again
objectively,
not
subjectively
as
determined
by
a
person's
ability
to
fill
out
a
juror
qualification
form.
now,
that
is
the
system
that
is
in
fact
in
operation
throughout
the
federal
system.
as
i
indicated
in
my
reply
brief
in
this
case,
district
courts
throughout
the
country
who
have
been
faced
with
suits
of
the
kind
that
this
is
an
affirmative
action
seeking
injunctive
relief
have
directed
or
suggested
to
state
officials
that
they
ought
to
take
a
look
at
what
the
congress
did
with
respect
to
that
federal
statute,
as
a
means
of
remedying
the
problem.
that
means
to
me
is
that
it
is
pretty
clear
that
90
years
of
litigation
and
the
repeated
admonition
to
jury
officials
that
they
must
reform
their
system
really
hasn't
worked.
and
the
only
kind
of
reform
that
is
an
essential
step
is
to
deal
with
the
source
of
the
problem
which
is
the
discretion
vesting
statutes
like
the
one
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
it's
pretty
clear
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that's
true,
but
if
the
question
that
you
have
to
ask
is
what
can
you
deal
with,
what
can
a
court
deal
with?
how
do
you
remedy
the
problem?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
don't
think
that
it's
possible
for
this
or
any
other
court
to
remedy
that
problem
by
an
injunction
which
says,
administer
the
statute
fairly.
the
court
has
done
that
consistently
for
90
years.
what
it
can
do
consistent
with
the
decisions
in
this
court
under
the
vagueness
doctrine
is
to
deal
with
the
state
enactment
which
permits
those
unreconstructed
attitudes
to
be
effective.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
that
isn't
the
way
to
get
at
it.
if
that
were
the
way
to
get
at
it,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would
not
have
the
constant
re-appearance
of
these
jury
discrimination
cases
in
this
court
and
in
courts
throughout
the
nation.
and
why
i'm
talking
about
the
nation,
i'm
talking
about
the
courts
in
that
southern
tier
states
where
the
problem
has
past
persisted.
and
just
excising
the
language
isn't
effective.
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
require
that
there
be
objective
standards.
it
doesn't
strike
neither
that
is
such
a
tremendous
problem.
now,
there
are
22
states
to
be
sure
which
have
similar
language.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
the
court
can
say
one
of
the
district
judges
in
cases
we've
cited
here
simply
said,
"we
suggest
to
you
that
you
use
objective
criteria
and
to
help
you,
we
refer
you
to
what
the
congress
did
in
the
jury
selection
service
act."
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
really
anything
wrong
with
the
court
indicating
what
kind
of
objective
criteria
would
be
desirable,
but
i
think
that
it's
important
for
the
court
to
indicate
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
objective
criteria.
of
the
states
in
the
union,
there
may
be
22
which
have
this
kind
of
vague
language
and
you
can
document
that
in
a
number
of
them.
it
has
been
used
and
employed
for
discriminatory
purpose,
and
that's
why
the
case
is
here
but
that
still
means
that
the
majority
of
the
states
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
operate
a
fair
jury
selection
system
by
using
language
of
this
sort.
my
own
submission
is
that
when
you
have
language
of
this
sort
and
you
put
that,
you
give
the
discretion
to
persons
who
are
then
reconstructed
in
their
attitudes
and
who
are
all
white
in
a
community
like
greene
county
which
has
a
black
majority
that
you
get
the
kind
of
results
that
are
shown
on
this
record,
and
those
results
have
been
documented
for
several
years.
there
was
a
prior
case
in
the
district
court
showing
what
happened
and
there
was
declaratory
relief
there,
that
didn't
work.
now,
when
you
issue
an
injunction
to
jury
officials,
it
was
really
telling
them
to
do
better.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
has
been
the
decision
making
process
in
this
court
for
decades.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
may
be
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know
about
the
case.
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
cases
which
have
come
to
this
court
and
the
cases
in
which
this
issue
has
normally
raised
are
cases
which
have
states
--
which
have
standards
like
these.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
not
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
not
all
of
them.
of
the
22
are,
i
think
there
were
seven
are
southern
states.
that's
one
out
of
three.
if
by
defining
southern
states,
you're
talking
about
11
or
12,
i
get
it.
that's
still
a
majority.
but
the
question
it
seems
to
me
is
really
not
how
many
states
are
or
not
employing
language
of
this
kind.
it's
the
abuse
creating
mechanism
that
language
of
this
kind
gives.
and
again,
i
resort
to
what
this
court
has
done
on
the
vagueness
cases
traditionally.
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
united
states
versus
louisiana
and
some
of
the
other
cases
that
we've
cited
here.
there
is
a
second
issue
that's
presented
here
and
that
is
whether
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
on
this
record,
should
be
upheld
in
refusing
what
we
think
is
an
essential
element
of
the
relief
to
which
appellants
are
entitled
in
this
county
with
its
history
of
racial
exclusion
of
blacks
from
the
opportunity
for
jury
service.
that
is
the
vacation
of
the
all
white
jury
commission
of
greene
county,
alabama.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they're
appointed
by
the
governor
who
was
a
--
who's
named
at
the
complaint
as
a
defendant.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
unlike
yesterday's
case
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
--
by
the
judge,
right.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
start
from
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
had
a
record
of
discriminatory
action
of
a
long
period
of
time
taken
by
jury
officials
all
of
whom
were
white.
i
look
at
the
statement
in
louisiana
v.
united
states
which
indicates
that
the
district
court
when
dealing
with
this
problem
of
racial
discrimination
has
the
duty
to
render
a
decree
that
will
give
effective
relief.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
on
our
first
submission,
an
essential
first
step
is
to
get
rid
of
a
vague
standards
and
to
require
objective
criteria,
but
it
is
also
pretty
clear
that
there
may
well
be
a
time
lag
between
the
time
that
that
relief
becomes
effective
and
that
in
any
event,
it
is
a
practical
impossibility
to
excise
all
discretion
from
the
administration
of
laws.
on
that
basis
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
community,
the
majority
whose
citizens
--
the
vast
majority
whose
citizens
are
black,
where
you
can
demonstrate
that
white
officials
have
consistently
discriminated
and
there
is
no
easier
demonstration
to
make
than
on
this
record.
that
as
an
essential
item
of
relief,
the
district
court
in
order
to
give
the
complete
relief
to
which
the
parties
here
were
entitled
should
have
required
the
appointment
of
some
black
members
to
the
jury
commission.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
appointed
by
the
governor
for
an
indefinite
period
until
the
successor
is
appointed
by
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
go
that
far.
i
think
what
the
court
had
before
it
was
a
situation
in
greene
county.
the
district
court
could
state
as
a
matter
of
its
discretionary
relief.
it
could
state
that
at
least
one,
it
could
divide
--
it
could
perhaps
even
order
an
election
and
in
the
county
like
greene
with
now
with
the
blacks
on
the
voting
roles
and
abundance
for
the
first
time
they
put
there
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
it
was
very
probable.
it
had
some
options.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no.
well,
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
appointment
of
all
white
jury
commissioners
in
this
county
has
already
violated
the
constitution.
and
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
relief,
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
district
court
stating
that
in
order
--
"because
of
that
of
that,
we
are
going
to
require
you
to,
in
this
county
at
least,
appoint
commissioners
in
a
different
way."
and
that
is,
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
state
laws
and
regulations
once
they
were
demonstrated
to
have
play
their
part
in
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
could
not
be
enjoined,
or
that
the
court
could
not
as
a
court
of
equity,
give
the
kind
of
relief
to
which
the
court
deemed
the
parties
were
entitled.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
right.
that
was
the
claim
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
the
claim
that
we
urge
here.
there
is
another
point
which
i
think
i
should
address
myself
to
that
is
the
district
court's
view
in
its
opinion
that
it
could
not
void
the
vague
statutory
standards
because
this
court
had
never
held
these
criteria
to
be
void
for
vagueness.
and
it's
cited
for
that
proposition,
cassell
versus
texas
which
is
one
of
a
group
of
five
cases
involving
the
texas
grand
jury
system
from
--
decided
in
this
court
from
1940
to
1954.
i
cited
also
an
old
1910
case
called
franklin
v.
south
carolina.
now
there
is
an
argument
addressed
to
both
of
these
in
our
brief.
the
submission
is
one
that
the
cassell
case,
in
that
case
the
issue
was
never
raised
on
the
court
without
inquiry
indicated
that
the
texas
statutory
scheme
was
alright.
the
franklin
case
it
seems
to
me
is
a
case
which
has
now
really
been
eroded
entirely
by
the
later
development
of
the
vagueness
doctrine
in
this
court
has
no
continuing
validity.
and
neither
of
these
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
used
to
prevent
the
court
from
granting
the
relief
that
we
urge
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
inquiry
as
to
what
occurred.
the
district
court
required
the
filing
of
a
report
as
indicated
in
its
opinion
within
60
days.
that
report
was
filed
in
november
of
last
year.
it
is
in
the
--
the
report
is
in
the
exhibits
that
are
on
file
on
the
clerk's
office.
i
looked
at
it
yesterday.
there
is
no
numerical
compilation,
scanning
it
in
the
case
that
there
are
approximately
50%
blacks
on
that
list.
i
don't
know
which
where
the
balance
is
tipped.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they
were
required
on
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
yes,
yes
they
are.
now,
whether
the
district
--
whether
the
jury
commissioners
will
consistently
do
that,
i
don't
know.
prior
to
that
injunction
there
were
no
racial
designations.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
that
the
particularized
reason
appear
from
these
records,
you
see.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
that
has
been
--
that
was
the
same
thing
that
congress
did
you
know,
in
the
jury
act,
and
in
both
the
jury
bills
because
the
problem
we've
had
in
these
racial
discrimination
cases
over
the
years,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
you
haven't
been
able
to
find
out
very
often
or
at
least
not
without
you'd
been
able
to
would
not
about
considerable
amount
of
difficulty
what
the
racial
breakdown
was.
now,
the
congress
recognized
that
that
it
was
important
in
order
to
demonstrate
racial
discrimination
that
what
the
numbers
were.
but
let
me
just
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
very
last
one
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
in
greene
county?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
at
least
three
or
four.
this
was
after
this
court's
decision
on
hadnott
v.
amos.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
are
about
three
or
four,
i
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
entirely
sure
what
the
offices
are
mr.
justice
black.
they
are
on
the
county
commission.
and
i
think
that's
a
three
or
four
men-commission.
they're
on
that
county
commission.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there
were
some
blacks
elected,
yes.
and
as
a
consequence
of
after
this
court's
order
in
hadnott.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well
that
was
true
in
that
voting
context,
and
that's
really
the
cognitive.
that's
really
our
submission
--
a
part
of
the
submission
with
respect
to
the
jury
commission
that's
in
our
brief
here.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that,
you
know,
the
civil
rights
commission's
report
documented
the
alienation
of
blacks
in
--
throughout
the
south
generally
in
alabama
and
greene
county
particularly.
and
we
indicated
that
one
of
the
ways
you
cure
that
since
jury
service
is
kind
of
a
twin
of
voting
service
in
terms
of
the
general
impact
on
the
public
life
community
that
it's
extremely
important,
particularly
in
a
county
like
this
just
as
it
was
in
the
voting
situation
to
have
black
people
serving
on
the
jury
commission.
now,
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
of
course,
of
course
but
the
jury
commission
at
this
point
is
not
an
elective
office
as
a
general
proposition.
i'm
simply
saying
that
on
this
record
of
course
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
oh!
i
don't
see
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
but
i'm
not
--
the
submission
is
not
nearly
that
broad
mr.
justice
black.
in
louisiana
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
it
has
occurred
on
occasions
and
it
has
occurred
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
those
occasions.
louisiana
v.
united
states
for
example,
was
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
and
this
court
later
affirmed
a
decree
by
that
court
requiring
the
registrars
not
to
use
a
citizenship
test
which
because
of
its
discriminatory
impact
on
the
right
of
negroes
to
vote.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
last
--
and
that's
one
example,
that
was
unique.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
don't
see
that
as
an
invalidation
of
the
law
because
i
see
that
only
as
a
remedial
aspect
of
the
court's
equity
powers
once
you
have
a
demonstrated
constitutional
violation.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't
see
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it's
not
an
election
law
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
when
i
addressed
the
question
of
how
do
you
deal
with
this
terribly
intractable
problem
of
racial
discrimination
when
the
governor
has
consistently
appointed
only
white
jury
commissioners,
and
those
jury
commissioners
has
consistently
discriminated
against
blacks,
i
think
our
constitution
can
reach
that.
and
i
think
that
this
court
can
say
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy
in
this
situation
without
invalidating
that
law
as
general
proposition
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
think
if
the
invalidation
occurs,
mr.
justice
black,
it
occurs
only
to
in
those
to
use
your
term,
unique
situations
in
which
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
as
it
is
in
this
case
that
this
kind
of
wide
ranging
deep
seeded
discrimination
has
occurred.
last
year
for
example,
as
a
matter
of
remedy
with
respect
to
the
teacher
integration
in
the
montgomery
county
case,
this
court
upheld
the
decree
whereby
district
judge
decided
that
the
way
to
get
at
this
problem,
because
other
methods
had
not
solved
the
problem,
but
the
way
to
get
up
the
problem
was
to
acquire
a
mathematical
ratio
in
schools.
i'm
simply
saying
of
course
it's
a
unique
proposition,
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
when
the
constitutional
violation
is
so
bold
with
this
court
in
the
past
has
responded
with
that
kind
of
unique
relief.
and
not
simply
think
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
pardon
me?
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
they
haven't
made
that
progress
without
a
concerted
judicial
effort.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
litigation
after
litigation
after
litigation.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
and
this
case
is
entirely
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
if
that
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
it
certainly
seems
that
just
as
the
majority
of
the
citizens
in
greene
county
are
entitled
to
elect
the
persons
that
they
choose.
the
jury
commission
which
forms
a
very
important
public
function
in
the
community
is
entitled
--
they're
entitled
also
to
have
some
representation
of
their
group
from
that
commissioner.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
my
time
is
up,
mr.
justice
black.
i
can
only
say
that
that
has
taken
very,
very
many
decades
and
i
don't
--
it's
not
my
judgment
that
that
is
a
miraculous
record.
