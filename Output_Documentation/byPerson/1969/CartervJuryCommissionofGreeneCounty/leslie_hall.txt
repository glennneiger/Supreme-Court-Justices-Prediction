mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
think
i
should
first
address
myself
to
a
little
problem
that
came
up
yesterday
afternoon,
and
that
was
in
the
georgia
case.
there
was
a
question
about
what
a
freeholder
was.
now,
that
demonstrated
that
that
was
considerably
from
the
georgia
case.
in
the
first
place,
you
don't
have
to
be
registered
voter
in
order
to
be
on
the
--
put
on
the
jury
roll.
the
alabama
statute
provides
that
you
can
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
householder
or
freeholder,
right
sir.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
own
property.
it
means
that
you
can
even
live
in
a
house,
you
could
be
a
tenant.
the
alabama
statute
is
much
more
liberal
as
far
as
qualifications
of
persons
who
are
put
on
the
jury
roll.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
the
district
court
said
on
page
364
of
the
appendix.
"alabama
is
the
most
enlightened
of
the
states
in
requiring
that
broadly
inclusive
community
list
to
be
consulted
and
that
all
eligible
persons
to
be
shown
on
the
roll."
now,
mr.
amaker
has
made
quite
a
point
here
about
greene
county.
greene
county,
i
have
to
admit,
has
had
a
whole
lot
of
fault.
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
come
around
to
this
point
and
that
is
the
point
that
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
is
say,
to
the
governor
of
alabama
who
he
should
appoint
as
members
of
the
jury
commission.
i
think
it's
quite
obvious,
quite
clear
this
court
and
to
almost
any
court
in
the
land
that
we
had
three
judges
down
there.
justice
goldbold,
justice
brooms,
justice
allgood
who
were
very
competent
and
capable
and
they
do
what
they
were
doing
when
they
set
forth
the
guidelines
for
the
jury
commission
of
greene
county
to
do
something
about
that
thing.
now,
we
turn
right
around
to
this
other
point
again.
mr.
amaker
suggests
that
this
court
dictate
to
the
governor
of
alabama
who
he
should
appoint
as
member
of
the
jury
commission.
now
that
almost
is
like
dictating
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
who
he
should
appoint
to
some
official
position.
i
don't
think
that
makes
sense.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
any
authority
to
do
it,
and
i
don't
think
any
court
in
the
land
has
the
authority
to
say
to
a
chief
executive
of
a
state
or
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
executive
body
who
he
should
appoint.
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
think
it's
to
the
pretty
right
to
the
court
to
say
who
should
be
appointed
as
jury
commissioners.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
--
mr.
leslie
hall
we
have
67
counties
in
the
state
of
alabama,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
and
if
this
court
robs
the
scope
of
the
thing
to
say
that
"we're
bringing
cash
out
to
this
net."
now
couldn't
that
apply
it
to
all
67
counties?
i
don't
know.
but
the
only
thing
i
know
is
it
was
decided
in
this
case,
the
swain
case.
and
mr.
justice
white
wrote
the
opinion
on
the
case
that
there
has
to
be
a
broad
representation,
isn't
that
correct
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
would
feel
that
way,
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
that
court
has
the
power
to
do
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
to
issue
an
injunction
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
alabama
telling
him
to
appoint
one
negro,
two
negroes,
black
people
pardon
me,
or
three
on
the
permission.
mr.
leslie
hall
oh!
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
alabama
--
they're
trying
to
solve
the
situation,
but
we
haven't
barely
solve
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
we've
got
three
very
competent
judges
down
there
and
i
think
it
probably
will
solve
it.
i
don't
know
why
they're
appealing
from
that
portion
of
it
anyway.
the
only
thing
i
wonder
about
is
why
they're
appealing
from
the
other
point.
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
was
wondering
why
the
appeal
from
the
--
they
got
a
favorable
decision
on
the
first
part,
and
now
they
wanted
us
to
just
change
that
old
expression
and
have
a
court
decree
that
the
governor's
got
to
do
this,
that
and
the
other.
now
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
considerably
more,
in
fact
i
try
to
tell
you
so
not
too
long
ago
in
connection
with
the
district
attorney
and
there's
(inaudible)
turned
up
more
negroes
than
there
were
white
people.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
been
done
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
wouldn't
be
reflected
in
our
appendix,
no
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
sir.
i
thank
this
court.
