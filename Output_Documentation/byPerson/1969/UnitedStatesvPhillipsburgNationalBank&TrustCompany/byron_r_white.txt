you
have
no

the

the
need
for

justice
byron

well,
how
can
you
assess
this

the
number
of

then
you
come
up
with
whether

at

invite
some
competition
in

large

if
you
got

but
you're
not
suggesting
the

there

justice
byron

let's
assume
that
there
weren't
anything
that
had
lending

over
$100,000.00
and
a
lot
of

went
outside

what
would
you
say
about

argument
then?
justice

well,
then
i
take
it
you
clearly
very
well

don't
you
have
to
concede

the
very
small
market
area
here
in
phillipsburg.
justice

even
if
it
is
arguable
by
saying
that
the

is
satisfied
outside

justice
byron

white
in
the
district

justice
byron

do
you
suggest
we
don't
--
technically,
we
don't
need
to
get
to
the
community
need
thing
at
all?
justice
byron

white
but
you
think
that
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
this
competitive
standard
on
the
competitive
effect
and
while
we
might
and
if
the
district

made
an
error
in
applying
the

that
you
suggest
we
should
tell

now.

but
before
we
can
tell

but
before
we
can

we

what
we
thought
commercial

wasn't
that
relevant.
justice

i

this

would
follow

wouldn't
it?
justice

how
about
easton?
justice
byron

white
well,
would
you
make
this
argument
if
the

area
was
just
phillipsburg

justice

well,
you
mean
the
less

areas,
the
more

there

when

told
us
that
there
is
a
little
business
in
the
--
this
area
that
--
justice

so
there's
plenty
of
--
there's
plenty
of

for

--
in

justice

it's

you
said
it's

justice

the
point
is
if
this

each

justice
byron

will
the

but
you
haven't

have
you?
the

why

what

is
not

what
would
the
comptroller
do?
justice
byron

white
well,
i
understand
--
i
understand
but
you
do
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
competition
between
the
two
banks
is
going
to
be
eliminated
but
your
point
is
that
competition
will
be
served
in
other
ways
and
in
ways
that
will
overbalance
any
loss
of
competition.
i
gather
that's
your
point.
justice
byron

white
well,
yes
but
how
is
it
procompetitive?
i
don't
understand
how
some
competition
will
be
eliminated
between
two
banks
but
not
specifically
how
this
competition
is
going
to
be
served
by
the
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
how
is
competition
going
to
be
served?
this
competition
is
going
to
be
served
you
say
by
enabling
another
unit
to
service
larger
loans,
that's
one
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
governor,
when
someone
asks
you
for
a
loan
that's
beyond
your
lending
limit,
do
you
normally
attempt
to
get
the
participants?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
often
that
do
you
have
to
turn
customers
away
because
you
can't
get
a
participation
certificate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
could
--
these
two
banks
who
want
to
merge,
what
could
they
do
by
merger
in
the
way
of
a
loan
they
couldn't
do
by
participating
each
other's
loans?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
somebody
wants
$250,000.00
loan
today
and
asked
one
of
these
two
banks
to
make
the
loan,
could
that
bank
go
to
the
other
one
and
if
the
other
bank
agreed,
couldn't
you
make
the
loan?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
operate
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you're
competing.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
i
understand
what
you
want
to
do.
do
you
have
a
larger
correspondent
bank
you
normally
call
on
to
participate
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whenever
you
have
involved
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
originate
the
big
loan,
the
only
thing
is
you
end
up
on
the
tail
end
and
they
really
manage
it,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
they
can
get
bought
by
bigger
bank
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
department
would
prefer
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
rather
have
a
philadelphia
and
the
big
philadelphia
bank
owning
one
of
these
banks
or
both
of
these
banks
with
that
manner,
right?
justice
byron

white
but
this
is
after
--
was
this
--
this
was
after

this
doesn't
reach
the
point
of
the
mergers

might

discouraged.

to
service
larger
loans,
that's
one
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
governor,
when
someone
asks
you
for
a
loan
that's
beyond
your
lending
limit,
do
you
normally
attempt
to
get
the
participants?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
often
that
do
you
have
to
turn
customers
away
because
you
can't
get
a
participation
certificate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
could
--
these
two
banks
who
want
to
merge,
what
could
they
do
by
merger
in
the
way
of
a
loan
they
couldn't
do
by
participating
each
other's
loans?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
somebody
wants
$250,000.00
loan
today
and
asked
one
of
these
two
banks
to
make
the
loan,
could
that
bank
go
to
the
other
one
and
if
the
other
bank
agreed,
couldn't
you
make
the
loan?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
operate
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you're
competing.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
i
understand
what
you
want
to
do.
do
you
have
a
larger
correspondent
bank
you
normally
call
on
to
participate
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whenever
you
have
involved
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
originate
the
big
loan,
the
only
thing
is
you
end
up
on
the
tail
end
and
they
really
manage
it,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
they
can
get
bought
by
bigger
bank
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
department
would
prefer
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
rather
have
a
philadelphia
and
the
big
philadelphia
bank
owning
one
of
these
banks
or
both
of
these
banks
with
that
manner,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
after
--
was
this
--
this
was
after
--
this
doesn't
reach
the
point
of
the
mergers
which
might
have
been
discouraged.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
there
was
a
formal
application
and
a
filing
of
rejection.
