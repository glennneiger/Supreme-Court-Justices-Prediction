what
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
shopping
centers
in
the
suburbs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
depends
on
the
area,
doesn't
it?
if
you
take
the
area,
the
u.s.
government
suggests,
your
argument
falls
flat,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
take
the
area
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
take
easton
and
phillipsburg,
and
as
of
now
you
got
four
banks
and
you'll
end
up
with
how
many
banks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
haven't
asked
if
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'll
have
less
banks
but
more
competition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
the
community
that
if
you
keep
going
little
further
or
it
is
about
to
just
end
up
like
appellation
that
big
banks
want
to
come
in
there.
we
say
that
this
area
is
just
going
to
flop.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
what
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
what
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yet
you
can't
point
to
a
single
instance
of
any
action
by
any
outside
bank
in
easton
and
phillipsburg.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
any
bank
is
made
or
moved
to
take
over
any
other
bank
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
all
we
have
is
the
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
probability.
you
can't
get
better
than
probability,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
in
easton
and
phillipsburg.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
also
agree
that
if
this
is
made
it
will
have
to
be
–-
you'll
have
to
run
to
carp
it
and
you
and
the
antitrust
division
and
everybody
else,
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
for
that
reason,
you
say
these
two
banks
should
be
permitted
to
merge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
governor,
if
you
merge
these
two
banks,
you
can
give
$100,000.00
but
once
they
merge
you
can
a
make
a
loan
of
$200,000.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
can
make
a
loan
of
$400,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you'll
come
in
five
years
later
and
say
since
you
can
make
a
loan
of
$600,000.00
you
should
be
merged
with
one
of
the
big
banks
you're
now
talking
about,
wouldn't
that
be
logical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
the
argument
just
as
logical?
that's
my
trouble.
