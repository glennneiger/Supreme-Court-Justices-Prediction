mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
primarily
address
myself
to
the
needs
and
the
facts
of
the
merger
and
the
relevant
geographic
area
particularly
as
it
applies
to
the
new
banking,
new
laws
in
new
jersey.
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
district
court
applied
erroneous
standards
in
assessing
the
convenience
and
needs
and
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
merging
banks
and
the
district
court
failed
to
adequately
consider
the
less
anticompetitive
alternatives
to
the
merger.
but
before
i
do
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
or
two
on
some
of
the
answers
to
questions
that
mr.
friedman
made.
first,
we
disagree
and
i
disagree,
that
the
district
court
ruled
that
commercial
banks
was
a
line
of
commerce.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
recognized
the
fact
that
there
were
at
least
banks
performed
various
functions
that
demand
deposits
alone
perhaps
was
the
only
line
of
commerce
but
in
new
jersey,
savings
banks
also
have
the
demand
deposit
function.
but
the
district
court
as
i
analyze
this
his
opinion,
stated
they
haven't
proved
their
case
and
didn't
really
attempt
to
say
this
is
the
--
first,
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
this
case,
to
prove
that
their
commercial
banking
is
the
line
of
commerce
and
the
district
court
felt
that
because
of
all
these
other
alternatives
that
were
available
and
the
testimony
adequately
showed
that
they
were
in
competition
with
all
these
other
areas
specifically
in
the
savings
alone
and
savings
bank
where
there
was
so
--
that
these
banks
that
were
so
predominant
in
savings
and
in
lending
for
residents
that
these
people
did
compete.
however,
he
didn't
have
to
come
out
and
make
a
determination
that
this
is
in
competition,
this
is
in
competition,
this
is
in
competition.
as
i
interpret
he
said,
they
haven't
proved
the
case
that
this
is
--
that
commercial
banking
is
a
line
of
commerce
and
instead
it
--
and
didn't
state
all
these
other
functions
were
in
competition
with
commercial
banking.
one
other
comment
mr.
friedman
made
was
that
the
recent
antitrust
cases,
recent
in
the
banking
field,
did
not
involve
smaller
banks,
that
this
is
the
first
smaller
bank.
large
banks
are
no
longer
--
have
no
longer
been
merging.
this
is
isn't
quite
true.
crocker-anglo
case
which
was
subsequent
to
the
nashville
case
and
subsequent
to
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
involved
the
merger
of
the
bank,
the
result
of
bank
at
$4
billion
in
assets.
so
that's
a
pretty
substantial
size
bank.
the
first
national
bank
of
jackson
involved
approximately
$350
million
bank
acquiring
a
bank
with
assets
of
about
$26
million.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
of
mississippi,
so
one
of
the
banks
was
quite
large.
first
national
bank
of
maryland
also
involved
a
large
bank
in
maryland
with
assets
of
approximately
$400
million
acquiring
a
bank
in
harford
county
with
assets
of
approximately
$30
million.
idaho
first
national
bank
in
idaho
which
was
just
decided
last
week
involved
a
bank
with
over
$300
million
of
assets
acquiring
a
bank
with
approximately
$26
million
of
assets.
so
it
isn't
quite
true
that
the
mergers
of
the
large
banks
have
ended.
all
of
these
cases
were
decided
all
of
these
cases
were
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
banks.
most
of
these
cases
involved
potential
competition
as
opposed
to
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
as
a
horizontal
type
of
merger.
there
was
some
horizontal
aspects
to
a
couple
of
these
cases.
a
comment
mr.
friedman
made
with
respect
to
the
reports
of
the
various
banking
regulatory
agencies,
i
would
like
to
comment
that
the
bank
merger
act
provides
that
these
agencies
must
report,
if
it's
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
involved
in
the
merger,
must
report
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
only
on
the
competitive
effects
not
on
the
convenience
and
needs.
they
do
not
and
are
not
to
consider
the
convenience
and
needs,
so
all
they
get
is
a
half
a
picture
when
these
regulatory
agencies
report
to
us
or
we
report
to
them,
the
losses
report
on
the
competitive
effects
as
you
see
them.
so
the
whole
picture
is
not
in
their
competitive
report.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
our
belief.
these
banks,
as
mr.
friedman
had
said,
are
phillipsburg
national
with
deposits
of
$2.4
million
and
second
national
with
deposits
of
$16
million
as
of
1967
are
small
banks.
they
are
truly
small
banks.
they
are
located
in
the
city
with
a
population
of
18,500.
the
population
has
remained
static
since
1960.
years
ago,
many
years
ago,
this
was
a
booming
community
when
the
coal
lines
were
operating
in
pennsylvania
and
around
the
surrounding
areas.
this
was
a
terminal
for
the
trains
to
bring
the
coal
in
and
to
hook
up
and
it
was
a
very
booming
and
very
prosperous
city
at
that
time
but
that
is
not
the
situation
now.
if
you
were
to
go
there
now,
you
will
see
rusty
railroad
tracks
and
cars
on
the
siding
rusting
also.
this
gives
you
an
indication
of
a
type
of
a
community
we're
talking
about
that
the
so
called
downtown
area
has
no
stores
in
it.
there
aren't
any
stores.
you
can't
buy
a
suit
or
clothes
in
phillipsburg.
this
is
the
economically
significant
area
that
the
government
is
talking,
that
justice
is
talking
about.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
downtown
area
as
we
understand
a
downtown
area.
there
are
no
stores,
maybe
one
or
two
restaurants
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
only
really
institutions
downtown
are
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national.
phillipsburg
trust,
the
only
other
bank
in
the
area
with
assets
of
about
$12
million
moved
out
of
it
several
years
ago
recognizing
that
the
area
was
so
--
needed
so
much
renewal,
that
it
wasn't
a
good
area
for
banks
to
be
located.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
downtown
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
easton,
the
population
of
easton
has
decreased
in
the
last
few
years.
now,
easton
has
a
population
of
approximately
30,000
people.
easton
has
a
downtown
area
of
approximately
three
city
blocks
on
either
side
with
a
square
in
the
center,
or
a
circle.
it
has
a
department
store
but
not
a
department
store
as
we
know
a
department
store
is,
as
we
in
this
city
know
a
department
store
or
in
other
large
cities.
that's
a
very
small
department
store.
it
does,
--
you
can't
buy
suits
or
clothes
in
easton.
there
are
about
two
or
three
small
suit,
men's
clothing
stores
but
they
don't
have
the
selection
that
the
average
person
today
would
like
to
have.
most
people
today
and
the
record
tell
--
and
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
go
to
allentown
or
philadelphia
to
buy
their
clothes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
have
a
shopping
center
in
phillipsburg.
there's
a
recent
shopping
center
was
developed
about
two
or
three
years
ago
but
and
it
has
an
orr's
department
store
which
is
allentown
and
orr's
is
also
in
easton,
in
the
outskirts
of
easton
but
that
shopping
center
doesn't
have
a
place
to
buy
suit
or
clothes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
didn't
move
out.
it
moved
out
of
the
downtown
area
to
more
into
the
suburban
area
where
the
--
where
industry
is
and
where
the
people
are
moving.
they
are
moving
--
they
are
gradually
moving
out
of
the
city
into
the
suburban
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
true.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
the
bridge
that
separates
the
two
is
about
a
city
block
long.
no
one
has
to
drive
across,
because
you
walk
across
it.
you
wouldn't
know
you
were
going
from
one
to
another
unless
you
can
see
the
sign
on
either
side
of
the
bridge.
the
--
as
of
these
two
banks
are
truly
small
banks
at
absolute
terms.
none
of
these
banks
of
course
have
had
any
prior
merger
activity.
they
are
located
in
the
community
that
was
formally
rural
and
now
turning
to
commercial
and
industry.
they
have
been
--
they
have
in
the
past
been
serving
the
area
by
accepting
deposits
and
lending
money
primarily
to
finance
residences
and
in
the
past,
farms
were
included,
and
as
the
area
has
been
changing,
the
farms
have
disappeared.
the
commercial
and
industrial
business
done
by
these
banks
is
insignificant,
especially
when
you
compare
this
with
that
done
by
large
commercial
banks.
the
demand
deposits
are
comparatively
small
and
savings
represent
the
bulk
of
their
deposits.
when
you
compare
these
banks
with
the
contested
section
7
cases
that
we've
had
in
the
past
such
as
the
manufacturers
hanover
and
the
hawaii
case
and
the
nashville
case,
they're
just
no
comparison.
you're
comparing
this
area
with
areas
that
were
urban
in
nature
and
abounding
with
business,
commercial
businesses.
those
banks'
primary
business
was
commercial
and
industrial
lending.
they
had
great
amounts
of
demand
deposits.
in
fact,
their
demand
deposits
range
anywhere
from
two-and-a-half
to
five
times
the
amount
of
savings
deposits.
the
reverse
is
true
here.
phillipsburg
national's
savings
are
two-and-a-half
times
its
demand
deposits,
quite
a
different
type
of
business,
a
different
locality,
a
different
community.
certainly,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national
cannot
be
judged
in
the
same
manner
as
those
large
urban
banks
and
i've
made
a
comparison
of
those
banks
on
exhibit,
intervenor
exhibit
number
one
and
are
listed
the
various
assets
of
these
banks
and
phillipsburg's
trust
assets
would
be
$41
million
as
compared
to
the
smallest
bank
there
with
$336
million
some
years
ago.
concentration
and
the
restraints
of
trade
in
large
urban
areas
with
such
billion
dollar
and
multibillion
dollar
banks
or
at
the
minimum
banks
with
approximately
half
a
million
must
certainly
be
viewed
differently
than
the
situation
these
two
banks
are
in.
even
though
the
county
is
growing
commercially
and
industrially,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
local
banks
are
small,
business
is
compelled
to
go
out
of
the
community
--
out
of
the
county
and
out
of
this
area
for
adequate
financing,
for
trust
facilities,
business
advice
and
other
needed
services.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
federal
reserve
took
a
different
view
and
the
department
of
justice
also
gave
us.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
think
the
fdic
reported
on
this
particular
one.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i'd
like
to
apologize
first
to
the
court.
i
did
make
a
mistake
in
the
answer
to
one
question.
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
did
send
us
a
competitive
report
but
i
have
forgotten
that
they
had.
oftentimes,
they
don't
and
it
just
slipped
my
mind,
so
all
three
agencies,
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
reserve
and
fdic
did
send
us
report,
all
were
adverse.
this
case,
i
believe,
is
quite
different
from
the
prior
litigated
bank
merger
cases
and
from
the
statements
in
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
we
can
see
the
glaring
differences
in
this
case
and
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
in
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
when
the
court
turned
to
--
this
court
turned
to
the
justifications
advanced
by
the
defendant
banks,
is
said
that
the
banks
do
not
contend,
that
is
--
that
is
philadelphia
national
and
gerard
do
not
contend
they
are
unable
to
compete
without
the
merger,
however,
in
this
case,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
do
so
contend.
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
to
the
effect
that
the
only
possible
way
for
these
two
banks
to
grow
was
by
merger.
it
could
not
be
possible
by
internal
expansion.
these
banks
must
hire
needed
specialists
to
compete
and
they
cannot
do
so
as
separate
institutions
as
the
plethora
of
evidence,
that
they
need
a
mortgage
man,
they
need
a
trust
man
and
they
need
a
commercial
and
industrial
loan
specialists.
these
men
come
high,
these
banks
by
themselves
just
could
not
possibly
afford
it
and
without
these
people,
without
proper
management
they
can
go
nowhere
and
there's
testimony
on
the
record
to
that
effect
also.
officials
of
second
national
stated
the
growth
that
their
bank
had
leveled
off.
there
was
other
testimony
to
the
effect
that
any
growth
by
these
two
banks
would
be
limited
to
the
possible
growth
of
the
economy.
the
banks
are
separate
and
that
they
have
no
future,
it
would
not
be
able
to
survive.
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank,
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
a
case
where
two
small
firms
in
the
market
proposed
to
merge
in
order
to
be
able
to
compete
successfully
with
larger
corporations.
however,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national
do
so
contend
in
this
particular
case.
they
are
two
small
banks
desiring
to
merge
to
better
compete
in
the
marketplace.
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
of
three
experienced
officials
of
larger
banks
to
the
effect
that
the
merger
would
intensify
competition
between
phillipsburg
and
easton
banks
and
it
would
eliminate
the
existing
apathy
in
banking
competition
in
the
area
and
that
the
merger
would
be
pro-competitive
and
benefit
the
community
with
better
personnel
and
extended
services.
there
was
an
abundance
of
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
merger
would
enable
the
resulted
bank
to
hire
the
needed
personnel
and
to
give
the
services
that
are
needed
to
make
them
an
aggressive
competitor
in
the
area.
it
should
be
noted
at
this
point
that
recent
legislation
in
new
jersey
has
amended
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
there
was
--
i
said
there's
plenty
of
businesses,
needed
services
in
the
area
but
there's
no
competition
in
the
area.
there's
apathy
in
the
area
that
these
banks
are
unable
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
their
growth
--
second
national's
growth
had
leveled
off.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
wasn't
losing
money
but
that
its
growth
had
leveled
off.
it
had
not
increased
its
deposits
and
at
the
same
pace
that
it
had
in
the
past,
that's
what
the
president
had
meant
by
his
growth
had
leveled
off.
however,
i
might
point
out
when
we
talked
about
the
banks
in
easton
being
so
large,
north
hampton
national
bank
with
over
$300,000.00
as
a
lending
limit.
practically,
does
nothing
in
some
of
these
lending
areas.
it
does
not
hold
anything
in
the
commercial
and
industrial
lending.
it
has
no
installment
lending
loans
whatsoever
and
if
--
it's
with
18
--
$18,961,000.00
in
deposits,
it
has
only
34.5%
of
its
deposits
loaned
out.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
show
that,
no.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
does
not
show
how
many
were.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
the
record
does
show,
a
number
of
witnesses
did
testify
that
they
could
use
this
kind
of
money
but
it
doesn't
show
how
much
was
actually
loaned
out
in
that
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
open
a
motel
in
phillipsburg,
said
he
couldn't
get
the
$250,000.00.
he
needed
$250,000.00
and
couldn't
get
it
there.
that's
the
first
one
that
comes
to
my
mind.
there's
a
testimony
that
phillipsburg
had
a
request
of
over
25
loans
in
excess
of
his
lending
limit.
second
national
had
17
requests
and
i
might
add
in
this
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
for
over
its
lending
limit.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
reason
you
don't
get
too
many
requests
because
business
people
generally
know
what
your
lending
limit
is.
this
is
sort
of
useless
to
go
to
some
place
and
ask
them
to
lend
you
$200,000.00
and
they
can
only
lend
$100,000.00.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
$200,000.00
today
is
not
much
of
a
loan.
you
can't
open
very
many
business
with
less
than
that
kind
of
money
unless
you're
talking
about
a
corner
store
or
something
like
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
sure
why
not
supply
all
of
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
they
have
to
have
--
they
have
to
have
the
credit
and
capital
and
so
forth
but
200
--
much
of
this
goes
to
expansion
and
to
increase
business
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
and
people
starting
in
business
sometimes
will
have
the
necessary
capital
and
collateral
to
put
up,
to
start
a
new
business.
they
don't
start
from
zero
and
ask
a
bank
for
a
loan
without
anything.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't.
i
was
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
doesn't
to
my
knowledge.
i
tried
to
get
that
information
but
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
me.
this
is
pretty
private
and
confidential
information
to
these
banks
and
they
hate
to
divulge
it
because
they
know
that
the
competitors
are
going
to
see
everything
that
you
tell
them.
so
it's
very
difficult
to
get
some
of
this
type
of
information.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
phillipsburg
trust
company.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
mr.
lupo
testified
for
that
bank.
mr.
lupo
testified
and
i
think
they
have
assets
of
approximately
$12
million.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
the
smallest
of
them.
it
has
--
it
is
the
bank
that
moved
from
the
downtown
area
of
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
has
one
branch
and
the
phillipsburg
national
has
two
and
second
national
has
one
branch
in
the
areas
surrounding
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
he
said
it
would
be
competitive.
he
was
opposed
but
not
strongly
so.
however,
the
court
in
analyzing
his
testimony
interpreted
to
be
the
testimony
of
a
man
who
was
satisfied
with
what
he
has
and
had
no
real
desires
to
go
beyond
a
certain
particular
area.
in
fact,
the
man
said
he
wasn't
even
looking
for
trust
business
and
the
name
of
the
bank
is
the
phillipsburg
trust
company.
and
this
is
a
general
condition
throughout
the
area.
this
is
why
this
merger
is
so
good.
this
is
a
merger
of
two
small
banks
who
can't
survive
unless
they
can
merge
and
get
the
adequate
capital
and
the
adequate
personnel
to
compete.
this
merger
with
an
aggressive
management
can
put
some
competition
into
that
area
and
get
rid
of
this
apathy
in
banking
competition.
the
president
of
easton
national
bank
which
is
the
largest
in
this
easton-phillipsburg
area
testified
that
they
can
find
themselves
pretty
much
to
the
easton
area
with
a
little
bit
of
business
in
phillipsburg
and
they
were
asked
why
didn't
you
go
into
bethlehem
and
allentown.
he
said,
“well
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
comptroller's
office
opinion
in
looking
at
the
future
by
survive,
that
don't
mean
they're
going
to
go
to
bankruptcy.
i
mean
they're
going
to
be
absorbed
by
the
large
new
york
banks,
that's
what's
going
to
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
no
sir,
i'm
not
alleging
it.
i'm
saying
that
in
their
present
condition,
they've
got
to
do
something.
the
only
thing
left
to
them
is
to
merge
so
that
they
can
compete
or
else
merge
with
some
of
the
larger
banks.
the
new
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
are
still
making
money
but
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
they
were
failing.
i
said
they
can't
be
effective
competitors
in
the
area.
they
can't
be
effective
competitors
in
the
area.
they're
two
small
banks
in
this
area
just
sitting
there.
once
the
large
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
once
these
large
new
york
banks
start
moving
in
the
area,
you
will
see
a
real
change
in
the
competition
and
it
has
already
started
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
a
large
new
york
bank,
new
york
in
assets
has
already
acquired
a
bank
in
washington.
there's
another
merger
pending
between
the
people's
national
bank
and
other
large
bank.
there's
a
branch
been
granted
to
morris
trust
company
over
in
morris
county
i
believe
it
is
who's
coming
into
warren
county
but
this
is
through
the
whole
area.
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
new
jersey
banking
law,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
change
and
applications
have
increased
for
bank
mergers
from
57
to
over
300
since
this
banking
law
has
changed
for
branches
throughout
the
first
banking
district
and
these
banks
are
in
the
first
banking
districts
which
contains
the
largest
banks
in
the
state.
the
answer
to
this,
if
this
merger
doesn't
go
through,
the
larger
banks
are
going
to
get
larger.
that's
all.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
change
in
the
law
was
prior
to
decision
but
subsequent
to
the
trial
and
at
the
day
--
the
day
the
opinion
was
rendered,
a
motion
was
made
by
the
plaintiff
to
continue
to
stay
until
they
couldn't
determine
whether
they
wanted
to
appeal
it
and
also
a
motion
was
made
to
reopen
a
record
to
accept
additional
supplemental
evidence.
the
comptroller's
office
introduced
evidence
showing
what
had
happened
since
the
change
in
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
the
court
accepted
this
evidence
and
its
intervenor's
exhibit
number
30.
it
shows
what
has
happened
since
this
law
changed
and
the
court
considered,
it
took
time
out
to
consider
it.
it
said
it
supported
his
opinion
that
this
merger
would
not
be
anticompetitive.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
addressed
themselves
primarily.
they
addressed
themselves
primarily
to
branching
because
there
is
some
limitations.
however,
the
new
census
estimate
that
has
come
out
has
opened
up
several
areas
which
is
not
in
the
record.
it
has
opened
up
several
areas.
however,
they
can
merge
throughout
and
merging
has
been
going
on
throughout
the
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
the
--
in
the
three
districts.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
three
banking
districts.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct,
all
over
countywide.
that's
why
i
say
these
banks
now
not
faced
just
for
the
compete
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
you
have
to
be
a
bank
holding
--
become
a
bank
holding
company
and
you
can
go
through
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
washington
trust
company
has
already
been
acquired
by
national
and
newark
and
essex
company.
these
banks
are
just
waiting
to
acquire.
these
large
banks
are
just
waiting
to
move
in
and
acquire
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
that's
our
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be.
the
antitrust
laws
are
aimed
at
fostering
competition
not
making
--
not
permitting
the
larger
banks
to
get
larger
and
creating
the
concentration
in
which
mr.
friedman
spoke
so
much
about.
we
are
talking
about
--
here's
two
banks
that
wanted
to
go
out
and
compete.
they
want
to
do
something
about
the
situation
and
they
say,
“no
stay
where
you
are
and
be
what
you
are.”
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
comptroller
proved
that
because
they
thought
there
has
been
additional
to
the
--
yes,
we
could.
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
most
of
them
were
potential
competition
cases
and
the
last
one
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
because
of
the
needs
of
the
community.
we
haven't
approved
every
single
one
but
because
of
the
needs
of
the
community,
we
have
approved
them.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know
what.
we
always
consider
the
facts.
we
send
an
investigator
right
and
we
spend
a
week
or
two
examining
these
things
before
we
do
it
but
let
me
say
this
that
if
we
felt
the
area
needed
it,
if
we
are
now
so
sure
the
area
need
it,
we
probably
would
let
them
come
in
but
i
don't
say
that
that's
the
best
thing
to
do.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
because
it
felt
it
needed
that.
it
needed
this
increased
lending
limit.
they
needed
the
service.
they
needed
the
trust
service
and
everything
that
wasn't
there
but
i
think
the
antitrust
laws
are
aimed
at
keeping
competition
in
the
area
and
if
we
can
keep
these
two
banks
who
are
willing
to
try
to
fight.
i
think
it's
pro-competitors
not
anticompetitive
in
any
respect.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
they
weren't
in
danger
financial.
i
said
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
have
the
figures
here.
mr.
friedman
said
they
have
profits
that
are
ranging
from
i
believe
for
a
five-year
period
1962
was
$46,000.00
to
$123,000.00.
and
that
over
a
period
of
five
years,
phillipsburg
national
made
a
$192,000.00
over
a
period
of
five
years
and
second
national
$198,000.00
over
a
period
of
five
years.
that
is
combining,
i'm
not
giving
them
year
by
year.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that
--
that
i
don't
know
whether
it's
so
great.
bank
profits
today
are
about
1%
on
their
investment
as
opposed
to
other
industries.
this
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
but
the
point
i'm
making
about,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
are
not
--
i'm
not
saying
they're
failing,
i'm
saying
that
if
we
don't
let
them
merged,
they
are
all
going
to
be
absorbed
by
larger
banks
in
the
first
district
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
--
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
antitrust
clause
is
for.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes
they
would
but
this
is
whatever
definitely
they're
suggesting
they
do.
there's
other
alternatives
to
merge
with
someone
else
and
not
in
the
city.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
those
two
small
banks
are
in
the
same
city?
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they're
in
the
same
city.
these
two
small
banks
are
in
the
same
city.
that
isn't
what
we're
concerned
about.
we're
concerned
about
competition
not
the
competitors.
i
don't
care
what
the
geographic
market
is,
what
the
relevant
geographic
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
continuing
that
theory
what
about
the
large
new
york
banks
coming
in
and
picking
up
all
these
other
banks.
you're
progressing
--
you're
jumping
beyond
any
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
so
that
they
can
effectively
compete
in
the
area.
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
antitrust
laws
are
for.
that's
what
it
makes
it
pro
competitive.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
more
competitive
in
the
area.
that's
our
position
and
we
think
it's
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
law
says
that
you
are
to
foster
competition
and
this
fosters
competition.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
if
they
merge,
there
will
be
more
competition
in
the
area.
these
are
two
local
banks
who
want
to
expand
and
grow
and
give
competition
to
an
area
which
there
is
testimony
already
on
record
that
there's
apathy
in
the
area
among
the
banks
for
them
not
to
merge
would
mean
that
the
larger
banks
would
come
in
and
grow
larger
whereas,
if
you
let
these
two
merge
at
least
they
will
try
to
do
something
about
it
that
competitive
situation
and
try
to
correct
the
apathy
in
the
area
and
attempt
to
fight
the
larger
banks
instead
of
having
them
eliminated,
we'd
at
least
have
another
bank
in
there
fighting.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
don't
care
what
area
you'd
take.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
phillipsburg
or
phillipsburg-easton.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
easton-phil,
there's
a
--
they
have
at
least
seven
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
would
be
left
to
six
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
less
banks
with
more
competition.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
if
the
big
banks
will
come
in.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes
they
will
come
in.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
to
which
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
to
grow
larger
and
to
get
larger
and
to
get
more
assets.
the
more
they
--
the
bigger
they
get,
the
more
profit
they
make
and
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
outside
of
easton
and
phillipsburg?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
no,
i
can't.
there's
nothing
on
the
record
to
show
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
we
have
more
than
a
possibility
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
i
think
it's
more
than
a
probability
but
if
you
look
at
intervenor's
exhibit
30,
you
will
see
what
has
already
happened
in
the
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
hasn't
happen
in
easton
and
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
might
point
out
that
when
you
include
easton
then
new
york
banks
cannot
come
over
to
easton
because
that's
pennsylvania
they're
confined
to
the
seven
county
first
banking
district.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
so
you're
only
talking
about
the
three
banks
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
yes
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
first
national
city
going
into
long
island
but
the
comptroller
doesn't
--
this
is
the
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
doesn't
perhaps
like
about
the
method.
we
dis
--
we
discourage
the
man
before
he
files
the
application
rather
than
go
through
of
the
expensive
trouble
of
filing
an
application.
they
come
and
talk
to
us
first
and
after
they
talk
to
us,
if
we
feel
it
looks
quite
obvious
that
this
merger
is
not
a
good
merger,
we
tell
them
don't
bother
filing
and
they
don't
bother
filing.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
think.
i
have
the
statistics
in
another
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
have
those
statistics
in
another
case
and
i
just
can't
quite
remember
what
i
--
if
i
had
to
answer
to
guess
i'd
say
around
30
or
something
like
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
around
30
or
40
if
i
had
to
answer
to
guess
on
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
quite
a
number.
i
don't
know
all
of
the
number
of
application.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
can
give
you
that
information
later.i
will.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
alright,
i
will
supply
that
information.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
it
could
end
but
you
have
to
draw
a
line
at
some
point.
i
mean
i
would
feel
that
people
that
borrow
that
kind
of
money
can't
go
to
new
york
and
they
can't
go
to
larger
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
i
wish
they'd
do
something
about
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
we
will
--
thank
you.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
primarily
address
myself
to
the
needs
and
the
facts
of
the
merger
and
the
relevant
geographic
area
particularly
as
it
applies
to
the
new
banking,
new
laws
in
new
jersey.
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
district
court
applied
erroneous
standards
in
assessing
the
convenience
and
needs
and
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
merging
banks
and
the
district
court
failed
to
adequately
consider
the
less
anticompetitive
alternatives
to
the
merger.
but
before
i
do
that,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
or
two
on
some
of
the
answers
to
questions
that
mr.
friedman
made.
first,
we
disagree
and
i
disagree,
that
the
district
court
ruled
that
commercial
banks
was
a
line
of
commerce.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
recognized
the
fact
that
there
were
at
least
banks
performed
various
functions
that
demand
deposits
alone
perhaps
was
the
only
line
of
commerce
but
in
new
jersey,
savings
banks
also
have
the
demand
deposit
function.
but
the
district
court
as
i
analyze
this
his
opinion,
stated
they
haven't
proved
their
case
and
didn't
really
attempt
to
say
this
is
the
--
first,
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
this
case,
to
prove
that
their
commercial
banking
is
the
line
of
commerce
and
the
district
court
felt
that
because
of
all
these
other
alternatives
that
were
available
and
the
testimony
adequately
showed
that
they
were
in
competition
with
all
these
other
areas
specifically
in
the
savings
alone
and
savings
bank
where
there
was
so
--
that
these
banks
that
were
so
predominant
in
savings
and
in
lending
for
residents
that
these
people
did
compete.
however,
he
didn't
have
to
come
out
and
make
a
determination
that
this
is
in
competition,
this
is
in
competition,
this
is
in
competition.
as
i
interpret
he
said,
they
haven't
proved
the
case
that
this
is
--
that
commercial
banking
is
a
line
of
commerce
and
instead
it
--
and
didn't
state
all
these
other
functions
were
in
competition
with
commercial
banking.
one
other
comment
mr.
friedman
made
was
that
the
recent
antitrust
cases,
recent
in
the
banking
field,
did
not
involve
smaller
banks,
that
this
is
the
first
smaller
bank.
large
banks
are
no
longer
--
have
no
longer
been
merging.
this
is
isn't
quite
true.
crocker-anglo
case
which
was
subsequent
to
the
nashville
case
and
subsequent
to
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
involved
the
merger
of
the
bank,
the
result
of
bank
at
$4
billion
in
assets.
so
that's
a
pretty
substantial
size
bank.
the
first
national
bank
of
jackson
involved
approximately
$350
million
bank
acquiring
a
bank
with
assets
of
about
$26
million.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
of
mississippi,
so
one
of
the
banks
was
quite
large.
first
national
bank
of
maryland
also
involved
a
large
bank
in
maryland
with
assets
of
approximately
$400
million
acquiring
a
bank
in
harford
county
with
assets
of
approximately
$30
million.
idaho
first
national
bank
in
idaho
which
was
just
decided
last
week
involved
a
bank
with
over
$300
million
of
assets
acquiring
a
bank
with
approximately
$26
million
of
assets.
so
it
isn't
quite
true
that
the
mergers
of
the
large
banks
have
ended.
all
of
these
cases
were
decided
all
of
these
cases
were
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
banks.
most
of
these
cases
involved
potential
competition
as
opposed
to
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
as
a
horizontal
type
of
merger.
there
was
some
horizontal
aspects
to
a
couple
of
these
cases.
a
comment
mr.
friedman
made
with
respect
to
the
reports
of
the
various
banking
regulatory
agencies,
i
would
like
to
comment
that
the
bank
merger
act
provides
that
these
agencies
must
report,
if
it's
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
involved
in
the
merger,
must
report
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
only
on
the
competitive
effects
not
on
the
convenience
and
needs.
they
do
not
and
are
not
to
consider
the
convenience
and
needs,
so
all
they
get
is
a
half
a
picture
when
these
regulatory
agencies
report
to
us
or
we
report
to
them,
the
losses
report
on
the
competitive
effects
as
you
see
them.
so
the
whole
picture
is
not
in
their
competitive
report.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
our
belief.
these
banks,
as
mr.
friedman
had
said,
are
phillipsburg
national
with
deposits
of
$2.4
million
and
second
national
with
deposits
of
$16
million
as
of
1967
are
small
banks.
they
are
truly
small
banks.
they
are
located
in
the
city
with
a
population
of
18,500.
the
population
has
remained
static
since
1960.
years
ago,
many
years
ago,
this
was
a
booming
community
when
the
coal
lines
were
operating
in
pennsylvania
and
around
the
surrounding
areas.
this
was
a
terminal
for
the
trains
to
bring
the
coal
in
and
to
hook
up
and
it
was
a
very
booming
and
very
prosperous
city
at
that
time
but
that
is
not
the
situation
now.
if
you
were
to
go
there
now,
you
will
see
rusty
railroad
tracks
and
cars
on
the
siding
rusting
also.
this
gives
you
an
indication
of
a
type
of
a
community
we're
talking
about
that
the
so
called
downtown
area
has
no
stores
in
it.
there
aren't
any
stores.
you
can't
buy
a
suit
or
clothes
in
phillipsburg.
this
is
the
economically
significant
area
that
the
government
is
talking,
that
justice
is
talking
about.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
downtown
area
as
we
understand
a
downtown
area.
there
are
no
stores,
maybe
one
or
two
restaurants
or
something
of
that
nature.
the
only
really
institutions
downtown
are
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national.
phillipsburg
trust,
the
only
other
bank
in
the
area
with
assets
of
about
$12
million
moved
out
of
it
several
years
ago
recognizing
that
the
area
was
so
--
needed
so
much
renewal,
that
it
wasn't
a
good
area
for
banks
to
be
located.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
downtown
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
easton,
the
population
of
easton
has
decreased
in
the
last
few
years.
now,
easton
has
a
population
of
approximately
30,000
people.
easton
has
a
downtown
area
of
approximately
three
city
blocks
on
either
side
with
a
square
in
the
center,
or
a
circle.
it
has
a
department
store
but
not
a
department
store
as
we
know
a
department
store
is,
as
we
in
this
city
know
a
department
store
or
in
other
large
cities.
that's
a
very
small
department
store.
it
does,
--
you
can't
buy
suits
or
clothes
in
easton.
there
are
about
two
or
three
small
suit,
men's
clothing
stores
but
they
don't
have
the
selection
that
the
average
person
today
would
like
to
have.
most
people
today
and
the
record
tell
--
and
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
go
to
allentown
or
philadelphia
to
buy
their
clothes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
have
a
shopping
center
in
phillipsburg.
there's
a
recent
shopping
center
was
developed
about
two
or
three
years
ago
but
and
it
has
an
orr's
department
store
which
is
allentown
and
orr's
is
also
in
easton,
in
the
outskirts
of
easton
but
that
shopping
center
doesn't
have
a
place
to
buy
suit
or
clothes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
didn't
move
out.
it
moved
out
of
the
downtown
area
to
more
into
the
suburban
area
where
the
--
where
industry
is
and
where
the
people
are
moving.
they
are
moving
--
they
are
gradually
moving
out
of
the
city
into
the
suburban
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
that's
true.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
the
bridge
that
separates
the
two
is
about
a
city
block
long.
no
one
has
to
drive
across,
because
you
walk
across
it.
you
wouldn't
know
you
were
going
from
one
to
another
unless
you
can
see
the
sign
on
either
side
of
the
bridge.
the
--
as
of
these
two
banks
are
truly
small
banks
at
absolute
terms.
none
of
these
banks
of
course
have
had
any
prior
merger
activity.
they
are
located
in
the
community
that
was
formally
rural
and
now
turning
to
commercial
and
industry.
they
have
been
--
they
have
in
the
past
been
serving
the
area
by
accepting
deposits
and
lending
money
primarily
to
finance
residences
and
in
the
past,
farms
were
included,
and
as
the
area
has
been
changing,
the
farms
have
disappeared.
the
commercial
and
industrial
business
done
by
these
banks
is
insignificant,
especially
when
you
compare
this
with
that
done
by
large
commercial
banks.
the
demand
deposits
are
comparatively
small
and
savings
represent
the
bulk
of
their
deposits.
when
you
compare
these
banks
with
the
contested
section
7
cases
that
we've
had
in
the
past
such
as
the
manufacturers
hanover
and
the
hawaii
case
and
the
nashville
case,
they're
just
no
comparison.
you're
comparing
this
area
with
areas
that
were
urban
in
nature
and
abounding
with
business,
commercial
businesses.
those
banks'
primary
business
was
commercial
and
industrial
lending.
they
had
great
amounts
of
demand
deposits.
in
fact,
their
demand
deposits
range
anywhere
from
two-and-a-half
to
five
times
the
amount
of
savings
deposits.
the
reverse
is
true
here.
phillipsburg
national's
savings
are
two-and-a-half
times
its
demand
deposits,
quite
a
different
type
of
business,
a
different
locality,
a
different
community.
certainly,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national
cannot
be
judged
in
the
same
manner
as
those
large
urban
banks
and
i've
made
a
comparison
of
those
banks
on
exhibit,
intervenor
exhibit
number
one
and
are
listed
the
various
assets
of
these
banks
and
phillipsburg's
trust
assets
would
be
$41
million
as
compared
to
the
smallest
bank
there
with
$336
million
some
years
ago.
concentration
and
the
restraints
of
trade
in
large
urban
areas
with
such
billion
dollar
and
multibillion
dollar
banks
or
at
the
minimum
banks
with
approximately
half
a
million
must
certainly
be
viewed
differently
than
the
situation
these
two
banks
are
in.
even
though
the
county
is
growing
commercially
and
industrially,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
local
banks
are
small,
business
is
compelled
to
go
out
of
the
community
--
out
of
the
county
and
out
of
this
area
for
adequate
financing,
for
trust
facilities,
business
advice
and
other
needed
services.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
federal
reserve
took
a
different
view
and
the
department
of
justice
also
gave
us.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
think
the
fdic
reported
on
this
particular
one.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i'd
like
to
apologize
first
to
the
court.
i
did
make
a
mistake
in
the
answer
to
one
question.
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
did
send
us
a
competitive
report
but
i
have
forgotten
that
they
had.
oftentimes,
they
don't
and
it
just
slipped
my
mind,
so
all
three
agencies,
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
reserve
and
fdic
did
send
us
report,
all
were
adverse.
this
case,
i
believe,
is
quite
different
from
the
prior
litigated
bank
merger
cases
and
from
the
statements
in
the
united
states
versus
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
we
can
see
the
glaring
differences
in
this
case
and
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
in
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
when
the
court
turned
to
--
this
court
turned
to
the
justifications
advanced
by
the
defendant
banks,
is
said
that
the
banks
do
not
contend,
that
is
--
that
is
philadelphia
national
and
gerard
do
not
contend
they
are
unable
to
compete
without
the
merger,
however,
in
this
case,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
do
so
contend.
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
to
the
effect
that
the
only
possible
way
for
these
two
banks
to
grow
was
by
merger.
it
could
not
be
possible
by
internal
expansion.
these
banks
must
hire
needed
specialists
to
compete
and
they
cannot
do
so
as
separate
institutions
as
the
plethora
of
evidence,
that
they
need
a
mortgage
man,
they
need
a
trust
man
and
they
need
a
commercial
and
industrial
loan
specialists.
these
men
come
high,
these
banks
by
themselves
just
could
not
possibly
afford
it
and
without
these
people,
without
proper
management
they
can
go
nowhere
and
there's
testimony
on
the
record
to
that
effect
also.
officials
of
second
national
stated
the
growth
that
their
bank
had
leveled
off.
there
was
other
testimony
to
the
effect
that
any
growth
by
these
two
banks
would
be
limited
to
the
possible
growth
of
the
economy.
the
banks
are
separate
and
that
they
have
no
future,
it
would
not
be
able
to
survive.
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank,
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
a
case
where
two
small
firms
in
the
market
proposed
to
merge
in
order
to
be
able
to
compete
successfully
with
larger
corporations.
however,
phillipsburg
national
and
second
national
do
so
contend
in
this
particular
case.
they
are
two
small
banks
desiring
to
merge
to
better
compete
in
the
marketplace.
there
was
testimony
at
the
trial
of
three
experienced
officials
of
larger
banks
to
the
effect
that
the
merger
would
intensify
competition
between
phillipsburg
and
easton
banks
and
it
would
eliminate
the
existing
apathy
in
banking
competition
in
the
area
and
that
the
merger
would
be
pro-competitive
and
benefit
the
community
with
better
personnel
and
extended
services.
there
was
an
abundance
of
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
merger
would
enable
the
resulted
bank
to
hire
the
needed
personnel
and
to
give
the
services
that
are
needed
to
make
them
an
aggressive
competitor
in
the
area.
it
should
be
noted
at
this
point
that
recent
legislation
in
new
jersey
has
amended
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
there
was
--
i
said
there's
plenty
of
businesses,
needed
services
in
the
area
but
there's
no
competition
in
the
area.
there's
apathy
in
the
area
that
these
banks
are
unable
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
their
growth
--
second
national's
growth
had
leveled
off.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
wasn't
losing
money
but
that
its
growth
had
leveled
off.
it
had
not
increased
its
deposits
and
at
the
same
pace
that
it
had
in
the
past,
that's
what
the
president
had
meant
by
his
growth
had
leveled
off.
however,
i
might
point
out
when
we
talked
about
the
banks
in
easton
being
so
large,
north
hampton
national
bank
with
over
$300,000.00
as
a
lending
limit.
practically,
does
nothing
in
some
of
these
lending
areas.
it
does
not
hold
anything
in
the
commercial
and
industrial
lending.
it
has
no
installment
lending
loans
whatsoever
and
if
--
it's
with
18
--
$18,961,000.00
in
deposits,
it
has
only
34.5%
of
its
deposits
loaned
out.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
show
that,
no.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
does
not
show
how
many
were.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
the
record
does
show,
a
number
of
witnesses
did
testify
that
they
could
use
this
kind
of
money
but
it
doesn't
show
how
much
was
actually
loaned
out
in
that
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
open
a
motel
in
phillipsburg,
said
he
couldn't
get
the
$250,000.00.
he
needed
$250,000.00
and
couldn't
get
it
there.
that's
the
first
one
that
comes
to
my
mind.
there's
a
testimony
that
phillipsburg
had
a
request
of
over
25
loans
in
excess
of
his
lending
limit.
second
national
had
17
requests
and
i
might
add
in
this
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
for
over
its
lending
limit.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
reason
you
don't
get
too
many
requests
because
business
people
generally
know
what
your
lending
limit
is.
this
is
sort
of
useless
to
go
to
some
place
and
ask
them
to
lend
you
$200,000.00
and
they
can
only
lend
$100,000.00.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
$200,000.00
today
is
not
much
of
a
loan.
you
can't
open
very
many
business
with
less
than
that
kind
of
money
unless
you're
talking
about
a
corner
store
or
something
like
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
sure
why
not
supply
all
of
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
they
have
to
have
--
they
have
to
have
the
credit
and
capital
and
so
forth
but
200
--
much
of
this
goes
to
expansion
and
to
increase
business
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
and
people
starting
in
business
sometimes
will
have
the
necessary
capital
and
collateral
to
put
up,
to
start
a
new
business.
they
don't
start
from
zero
and
ask
a
bank
for
a
loan
without
anything.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't.
i
was
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
doesn't
to
my
knowledge.
i
tried
to
get
that
information
but
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
me.
this
is
pretty
private
and
confidential
information
to
these
banks
and
they
hate
to
divulge
it
because
they
know
that
the
competitors
are
going
to
see
everything
that
you
tell
them.
so
it's
very
difficult
to
get
some
of
this
type
of
information.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
phillipsburg
trust
company.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
mr.
lupo
testified
for
that
bank.
mr.
lupo
testified
and
i
think
they
have
assets
of
approximately
$12
million.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
the
smallest
of
them.
it
has
--
it
is
the
bank
that
moved
from
the
downtown
area
of
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
has
one
branch
and
the
phillipsburg
national
has
two
and
second
national
has
one
branch
in
the
areas
surrounding
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
he
said
it
would
be
competitive.
he
was
opposed
but
not
strongly
so.
however,
the
court
in
analyzing
his
testimony
interpreted
to
be
the
testimony
of
a
man
who
was
satisfied
with
what
he
has
and
had
no
real
desires
to
go
beyond
a
certain
particular
area.
in
fact,
the
man
said
he
wasn't
even
looking
for
trust
business
and
the
name
of
the
bank
is
the
phillipsburg
trust
company.
and
this
is
a
general
condition
throughout
the
area.
this
is
why
this
merger
is
so
good.
this
is
a
merger
of
two
small
banks
who
can't
survive
unless
they
can
merge
and
get
the
adequate
capital
and
the
adequate
personnel
to
compete.
this
merger
with
an
aggressive
management
can
put
some
competition
into
that
area
and
get
rid
of
this
apathy
in
banking
competition.
the
president
of
easton
national
bank
which
is
the
largest
in
this
easton-phillipsburg
area
testified
that
they
can
find
themselves
pretty
much
to
the
easton
area
with
a
little
bit
of
business
in
phillipsburg
and
they
were
asked
why
didn't
you
go
into
bethlehem
and
allentown.
he
said,
“well
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
comptroller's
office
opinion
in
looking
at
the
future
by
survive,
that
don't
mean
they're
going
to
go
to
bankruptcy.
i
mean
they're
going
to
be
absorbed
by
the
large
new
york
banks,
that's
what's
going
to
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
no
sir,
i'm
not
alleging
it.
i'm
saying
that
in
their
present
condition,
they've
got
to
do
something.
the
only
thing
left
to
them
is
to
merge
so
that
they
can
compete
or
else
merge
with
some
of
the
larger
banks.
the
new
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
are
still
making
money
but
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
they
were
failing.
i
said
they
can't
be
effective
competitors
in
the
area.
they
can't
be
effective
competitors
in
the
area.
they're
two
small
banks
in
this
area
just
sitting
there.
once
the
large
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
once
these
large
new
york
banks
start
moving
in
the
area,
you
will
see
a
real
change
in
the
competition
and
it
has
already
started
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
a
large
new
york
bank,
new
york
in
assets
has
already
acquired
a
bank
in
washington.
there's
another
merger
pending
between
the
people's
national
bank
and
other
large
bank.
there's
a
branch
been
granted
to
morris
trust
company
over
in
morris
county
i
believe
it
is
who's
coming
into
warren
county
but
this
is
through
the
whole
area.
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
new
jersey
banking
law,
there
has
been
a
tremendous
change
and
applications
have
increased
for
bank
mergers
from
57
to
over
300
since
this
banking
law
has
changed
for
branches
throughout
the
first
banking
district
and
these
banks
are
in
the
first
banking
districts
which
contains
the
largest
banks
in
the
state.
the
answer
to
this,
if
this
merger
doesn't
go
through,
the
larger
banks
are
going
to
get
larger.
that's
all.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
change
in
the
law
was
prior
to
decision
but
subsequent
to
the
trial
and
at
the
day
--
the
day
the
opinion
was
rendered,
a
motion
was
made
by
the
plaintiff
to
continue
to
stay
until
they
couldn't
determine
whether
they
wanted
to
appeal
it
and
also
a
motion
was
made
to
reopen
a
record
to
accept
additional
supplemental
evidence.
the
comptroller's
office
introduced
evidence
showing
what
had
happened
since
the
change
in
the
new
jersey
banking
laws.
the
court
accepted
this
evidence
and
its
intervenor's
exhibit
number
30.
it
shows
what
has
happened
since
this
law
changed
and
the
court
considered,
it
took
time
out
to
consider
it.
it
said
it
supported
his
opinion
that
this
merger
would
not
be
anticompetitive.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
addressed
themselves
primarily.
they
addressed
themselves
primarily
to
branching
because
there
is
some
limitations.
however,
the
new
census
estimate
that
has
come
out
has
opened
up
several
areas
which
is
not
in
the
record.
it
has
opened
up
several
areas.
however,
they
can
merge
throughout
and
merging
has
been
going
on
throughout
the
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
the
--
in
the
three
districts.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
three
banking
districts.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct,
all
over
countywide.
that's
why
i
say
these
banks
now
not
faced
just
for
the
compete
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
you
have
to
be
a
bank
holding
--
become
a
bank
holding
company
and
you
can
go
through
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
washington
trust
company
has
already
been
acquired
by
national
and
newark
and
essex
company.
these
banks
are
just
waiting
to
acquire.
these
large
banks
are
just
waiting
to
move
in
and
acquire
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
--
that's
our
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be.
the
antitrust
laws
are
aimed
at
fostering
competition
not
making
--
not
permitting
the
larger
banks
to
get
larger
and
creating
the
concentration
in
which
mr.
friedman
spoke
so
much
about.
we
are
talking
about
--
here's
two
banks
that
wanted
to
go
out
and
compete.
they
want
to
do
something
about
the
situation
and
they
say,
“no
stay
where
you
are
and
be
what
you
are.”
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
comptroller
proved
that
because
they
thought
there
has
been
additional
to
the
--
yes,
we
could.
yes.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
most
of
them
were
potential
competition
cases
and
the
last
one
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
because
of
the
needs
of
the
community.
we
haven't
approved
every
single
one
but
because
of
the
needs
of
the
community,
we
have
approved
them.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know
what.
we
always
consider
the
facts.
we
send
an
investigator
right
and
we
spend
a
week
or
two
examining
these
things
before
we
do
it
but
let
me
say
this
that
if
we
felt
the
area
needed
it,
if
we
are
now
so
sure
the
area
need
it,
we
probably
would
let
them
come
in
but
i
don't
say
that
that's
the
best
thing
to
do.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
because
it
felt
it
needed
that.
it
needed
this
increased
lending
limit.
they
needed
the
service.
they
needed
the
trust
service
and
everything
that
wasn't
there
but
i
think
the
antitrust
laws
are
aimed
at
keeping
competition
in
the
area
and
if
we
can
keep
these
two
banks
who
are
willing
to
try
to
fight.
i
think
it's
pro-competitors
not
anticompetitive
in
any
respect.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
didn't
say
they
weren't
in
danger
financial.
i
said
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
have
the
figures
here.
mr.
friedman
said
they
have
profits
that
are
ranging
from
i
believe
for
a
five-year
period
1962
was
$46,000.00
to
$123,000.00.
and
that
over
a
period
of
five
years,
phillipsburg
national
made
a
$192,000.00
over
a
period
of
five
years
and
second
national
$198,000.00
over
a
period
of
five
years.
that
is
combining,
i'm
not
giving
them
year
by
year.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that
--
that
i
don't
know
whether
it's
so
great.
bank
profits
today
are
about
1%
on
their
investment
as
opposed
to
other
industries.
this
is
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
but
the
point
i'm
making
about,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
are
not
--
i'm
not
saying
they're
failing,
i'm
saying
that
if
we
don't
let
them
merged,
they
are
all
going
to
be
absorbed
by
larger
banks
in
the
first
district
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
--
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
antitrust
clause
is
for.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes
they
would
but
this
is
whatever
definitely
they're
suggesting
they
do.
there's
other
alternatives
to
merge
with
someone
else
and
not
in
the
city.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
those
two
small
banks
are
in
the
same
city?
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they're
in
the
same
city.
these
two
small
banks
are
in
the
same
city.
that
isn't
what
we're
concerned
about.
we're
concerned
about
competition
not
the
competitors.
i
don't
care
what
the
geographic
market
is,
what
the
relevant
geographic
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
continuing
that
theory
what
about
the
large
new
york
banks
coming
in
and
picking
up
all
these
other
banks.
you're
progressing
--
you're
jumping
beyond
any
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
so
that
they
can
effectively
compete
in
the
area.
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
antitrust
laws
are
for.
that's
what
it
makes
it
pro
competitive.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
more
competitive
in
the
area.
that's
our
position
and
we
think
it's
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
the
law
says
that
you
are
to
foster
competition
and
this
fosters
competition.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
if
they
merge,
there
will
be
more
competition
in
the
area.
these
are
two
local
banks
who
want
to
expand
and
grow
and
give
competition
to
an
area
which
there
is
testimony
already
on
record
that
there's
apathy
in
the
area
among
the
banks
for
them
not
to
merge
would
mean
that
the
larger
banks
would
come
in
and
grow
larger
whereas,
if
you
let
these
two
merge
at
least
they
will
try
to
do
something
about
it
that
competitive
situation
and
try
to
correct
the
apathy
in
the
area
and
attempt
to
fight
the
larger
banks
instead
of
having
them
eliminated,
we'd
at
least
have
another
bank
in
there
fighting.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
don't
care
what
area
you'd
take.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
phillipsburg
or
phillipsburg-easton.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
in
easton-phil,
there's
a
--
they
have
at
least
seven
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
they
would
be
left
to
six
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
less
banks
with
more
competition.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
if
the
big
banks
will
come
in.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes
they
will
come
in.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
to
which
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
to
grow
larger
and
to
get
larger
and
to
get
more
assets.
the
more
they
--
the
bigger
they
get,
the
more
profit
they
make
and
the
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
outside
of
easton
and
phillipsburg?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
no,
i
can't.
there's
nothing
on
the
record
to
show
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
we
have
more
than
a
possibility
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
i
think
it's
more
than
a
probability
but
if
you
look
at
intervenor's
exhibit
30,
you
will
see
what
has
already
happened
in
the
area.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
it
hasn't
happen
in
easton
and
phillipsburg.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
might
point
out
that
when
you
include
easton
then
new
york
banks
cannot
come
over
to
easton
because
that's
pennsylvania
they're
confined
to
the
seven
county
first
banking
district.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
so
you're
only
talking
about
the
three
banks
and
--
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
yes,
yes
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
first
national
city
going
into
long
island
but
the
comptroller
doesn't
--
this
is
the
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
doesn't
perhaps
like
about
the
method.
we
dis
--
we
discourage
the
man
before
he
files
the
application
rather
than
go
through
of
the
expensive
trouble
of
filing
an
application.
they
come
and
talk
to
us
first
and
after
they
talk
to
us,
if
we
feel
it
looks
quite
obvious
that
this
merger
is
not
a
good
merger,
we
tell
them
don't
bother
filing
and
they
don't
bother
filing.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
think.
i
have
the
statistics
in
another
case.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
have
those
statistics
in
another
case
and
i
just
can't
quite
remember
what
i
--
if
i
had
to
answer
to
guess
i'd
say
around
30
or
something
like
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
around
30
or
40
if
i
had
to
answer
to
guess
on
it.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
quite
a
number.
i
don't
know
all
of
the
number
of
application.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
sir?
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
i
can
give
you
that
information
later.i
will.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
alright,
i
will
supply
that
information.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
it
could
end
but
you
have
to
draw
a
line
at
some
point.
i
mean
i
would
feel
that
people
that
borrow
that
kind
of
money
can't
go
to
new
york
and
they
can't
go
to
larger
banks.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
well,
i
wish
they'd
do
something
about
that.
mr.
philip
l.
roache,
jr.
we
will
--
thank
you.
