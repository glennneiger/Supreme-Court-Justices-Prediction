there
have
been
a
quite
a
number
of
them
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
however,
have
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well
then,

chief

warren
e.

(inaudible)
chief

warren
e.
burger
not
to
appeal.
there
have
been
i
think
three
or
four
of
them
but
those
involved
somewhat
different
situations.
those
in
contrast
to
this
case
which
involves
the
combination
of
two
banks
in
the
same
market,
direct
competitors.
most
of
the
cases
that
we
have
brought
and
decided
not
to
appeal
have
been
cases
in
which
a
large
bank
from
outside
the
immediate
area
has
come
in
and
acquired
a
bank
in
the
market.
the
theory
there
being
there
was
an
elimination
of
a
potential
competition
of
the
bank
that
came
in
acquired
to
merger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
merged
institutions
could
expand
their
business
to
the
outer
perimeter
of
the
larger
area
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
by
virtue
of
the
merger?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
banks
can
lend
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
in
easton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
many
in
phillipsburg
over
a
quarter
of
a

chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
mr.
roache.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
then
that
the
downtown

of
easton
is
in
effect
the
downtown

both?
chief

warren
e.
burger
to

that
you

chief

chief

i
understood
you

say
it

leveled
off.
chief

chief

warren
e.

their

five
--
you'll
have
five
in
this
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seven
to
six.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
two
to
one
would
carry
a
lot
more
weight
with
me
if
you
were
saying
that
this
law
was
in
tulsa,
oklahoma
and
the
other
was
in
oklahoma
city
but
here
you
have
one
--
it
doesn't
rate
metropolitan

community
separated

a
river.

be
cut
down

six.
