what
is
the
population
of
phillipsburg
and
what
of
easton?
justice

how
far
is
easton
from

justice

they
have
bridge?
justice

black
how
far
is
phillipsburg
from
the

line?
justice

black
right
at
the
river?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
the
stores
closing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
a
bank
moved
out
of
phillipsburg.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
happening
in
a
great,
many
places,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
it
was
losing
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
how
many
$200,000.00
loans
that
were
available
around
phillipsburg?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
assume
from
what
you
say
about
it,
that
there
were
not
be
so
many
loans
of
$200,000.00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
were
the
witnesses
who
testified
they
could
use
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
were
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
seventeen
for
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
there
would
be
very
few
places
in
the
united
states
as
you
all
have
described
this.
it
would
be
engaged
very
liberally
in
the
$200,000.00
loans.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
big
business
loan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wouldn't
suppose
they
want
to
supply
all
of
it
from
the
whole
of
the
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
somebody
had
no
money
at
all
and
you're
just
going
to
lend
them
$200,000.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
saying
about
extension.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
how
much
--
how
many
$200,000.00
loans
easton
had
made
in
the
last
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
show
if
it
had
made
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
couldn't
survive
without
merging?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
failure
in
company
defense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
still
making
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
a
little
quick
on
the
trigger
about
their
failing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
they
can't
lend
$200,000.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
you
say,
they're
willing
to
keep
on
trying
to
fight.
i
understand
you
to
say
they
are
not
in
any
danger
financially.
how
much
did
they
make
last
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
did
they
make
last
year
on
their
dividends?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
pretty
good
for
a
bank
in
that
kind
of
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
imagine
that's
temporary
if
your
goal
is
high
interest
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
can
they
be
absorbed
without
merging?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
be
absorbed
without
merging
or
something?
well,
they
have
to
go
through
the
same
process,
wouldn't
it
with
the
department
of
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
it
make
if
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
law
--
this
law
i
thought
had
the
theory
that
they
use
to
have
own
dominoes.
if
you
put
them
up
on
the
head
and
stand
up
right
next
to
one
another,
you
let
one
of
them
knock
the
other
down,
and
it
just
keep
on
knocking
them
down
until
there's
just
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
arguing
that
in
order
to
prevent
double
up,
the
thing
to
do
is
to
let
them
merge
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
it
more
competitive
for
them
to
merge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
theory,
the
law
has
written
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
bigger
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
of
them?
i
might
misunderstood
the
question
of
justice
douglas.
how
many
times
does
the
present
comptroller
refused
to
agree
to
a
merger
and
in
what
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
that
it
might
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
around
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
has
rejected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
give
them
to
us
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
supply
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
and
what
banks
and
how
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
your
bank
ever
lost
any
money
during
any
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
was
wondering
if
they
have
ever
lost
any
money
to
you
or
are
they
still
making
money
every
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
thought
about
selling
any
stock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
mergers.
i'm
talking
about
did
you
ever
think
about
doing
it
in
a
way
that
wouldn't
close
up
any
banks,
just
get
yourselves
talk
to
people
in
addition
to
what
you've
sold?
it
seemed
to
be
done
pretty
well
through
the
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
propose
to
help
it
by
merging
and
reduce
the
number
of
banks
instead
of
increasing
them.
justice
hugo
l.

who
made
that
loan?
