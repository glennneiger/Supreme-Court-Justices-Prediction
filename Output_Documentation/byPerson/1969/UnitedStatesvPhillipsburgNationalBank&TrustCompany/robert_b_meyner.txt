mr.
robert
b.
meyner
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
culmination
of
a
long
series
of
episodes
by
which
two
banks
endeavored
to
be
pro-competitive
in
an
extensive
area.
discussion
to
meet
the
problems
that
existed
as
between
older
management
and
younger
management
as
to
how
we
could
serve
the
customers
in
the
neighborhood,
the
people
who
were
in
need
of
loans
to
finance
various
enterprises,
all
of
those
problems
were
taken
into
consideration
and
it
was
felt
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
we
could
meet
the
problem
so
we
discuss
merger
and
then
in
1967
signed
an
agreement
and
then
filed
an
application
with
the
comptroller.
the
three
agencies,
not
through
their
somber
boards
but
rather
through
a
bureaucratic
employees
took
the
narrow
blind
view
that
only
easton
was
a
market
or
easton
and
phillipsburg
was
a
market,
that
they
submitted
that
various
reports
but
then
there
was
a
full
and
adequate
hearing
before
the
comptroller,
justice
shows
not
to
appear
on
the
scene.
then
we
produce
witnesses
and
then
a
decision
was
arrived
at
that
this
was
an
area
somewhat
similar
to
the
standard,
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
is
set
forth
in
white
in
this
exhibit,
exhibit
13.
then
we
found
that
after
we
are
ready
to
go
with
the
merger,
justice
starts
a
suit.
then
we
go
to
the
district
court
in
new
jersey
where
we
have
1600
pages
of
testimony,
where
we
have
over
100
exhibits,
where
we're
put
to
untold
difficulty
in
getting
out
records
as
to
duplicate
depositors
in
each
bank,
furnishing
infinite
information
then
the
judge
became
ill
after
the
conclusion
of
the
case
and
we
waited
a
year
for
a
decision
and
now
this
suit
is
here
before
you.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
three
things.
number
one,
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
this
is
procompetitive.
there
isn't
one
witness,
least
of
all
mr.
lupo
who
says
that
this
is
anticompetitive.
at
most
he
said
in
--
and
i
refer
you
to
the
appendix
in
page
35,
in
the
record
it's
probably
page
134,
he
was
asked
about
the
competition
between
his
bank,
that
is
the
third
largest
bank
and
two
existing
banks
in
phillipsburg
and
he
said,
“i
would
say
it
was
healthy
competition,
healthy
competition
to
the
extent
that
we
have
grown,
that
we
have
recognized
and
we
have
progressed.
i
would
say
it
was
healthy
competition.”
and
the
court,
“when
you
defined
it
as
healthy
competition,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
consider
this
competition
as
a
factor
in
your
own
growth.”
then
i
say
to
you,
if
you
read
the
record
1600
pages,
you
can
not
find
one
of
the
people
who
as
bankers
appeared
on
the
scene
to
say
that
this
was
anticompetitive,
not
one.
the
--
the
--
we'll
take
mr.
greenly
of
the
second
largest
bank
in
new
jersey.
he
looked
over
the
entire
situation.
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
premium
on
any
of
the
exchange
of
shares
like
there
was
in
the
national
case.
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
fair
exchange
and
that
it
was
--
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
would
cause
customers
to
have
to
pay
the
toll
or
pay
anything
additional.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
most
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
i
think
the
customer
that
we're
talking
about
--
the
customer
that
mr.
friedman
has
also
listed
is
about,
he
will
have
five
choices
instead
of
two
and
one
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
and
the
--
and
the
customer
will
not
be
heard
because
the
charges
are
essentially
the
same
for
checking
accounts
and
more
and
more
since
there
is
a
better
return
on
time
deposits,
most
of
the
money
is
going
under
the
time
deposit
area
and
you
take
william
jones,
william
f.
jones
of
the
easton
bank.
he
specifically
pointed
out
that
this
would
be
procompetitive.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we
had
at
least
ten
witnesses
who
appear,
appliance
dealers,
automobile
dealers,
manufacturers,
industry
people
who
pointed
out
that
their
needs
were
well
in
excess
of
$200,000.00.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
borrowers
from
our
bank
are
directors
of
the
phillipsburg
trust
company
and
they
testified
for
us
saying
that
they
felt
that
they
would
be
better
served
if
these
banks
were
merged
and
they
could
have
a
larger
borrowing
limit.
mr.
riccardi
and
mr.
falk,
mr.
falk
who
operates
outside
of
phillipsburg
a
tremendous
market
outside
of
easton
one,
outside
and
two
outside
of
allentown.
these
are
the
people
who
--
the
testimonies
replete.
there
isn't
one
as
there
is
in
these
previous
cases,
there
isn't
one
person
or
one
banker
who
came
in
and
said
this
will
affect
the
community,
this
will
hurt
the
community.
everyone
was
willing
to
--
most
people
were
willing
to
testify
and
no
one
testified
against
it
except
mr.
edwards
who
was
a
young
phd
with
a
j.d.
degree
at
the
age
of
31
and
who
on
the
basis
of
casual
empiricism
arrived
at
the
conclusion
by
his
doctoral
thesis
on
the
basis
of
standard
statistical
standard,
metropolitan
statistical
area
that
he
has
examined
some
49
of
them
and
he
examined
them
in
terms
of
what
happened
in
1955
and
1957
and
he
concluded
that
when
you
had
a
merger
of
this
sort,
interest
rates
on
savings
deposits
were
reduced
and
interests
on
loans
were
increased.
this
was
contradicted
by
all
of
our
experts,
contradicted
by
bankers.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes
as
was
--
as
was
pointed
out
in
nashville
and
philadelphia,
two
banks
will
be
better
able
to
compete
with
other
banks
in
any
of
these
areas.
now,
let's
just
take
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
that
you
have
the
large
banks
in
allentown,
you
have
the
large
banks
in
bethlehem,
you
have
a
large
bank
south
of
us
and
no
one
in
phillipsburg
can
get
a
loan
in
excess
of
$100,000.00.
he's
got
to
go
to
the
other
neighborhoods.
now,
he
can
get
a
larger
loan
and
i
think
it
was
recognized
in
the
nashville
case
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
did
remedy
that
situation,
that
situation
of
larger
loan
limit
and
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
was
sort
of
held
out
because
it
was
felt
that
the
bank
merger
act
prevented
them,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
but
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
i
think,
by
the
nashville
case
indicated
that
it
could
--
that
would
be
one
of
the
factors
and
another
factor
would
be
the
management,
a
better
opportunity
to
hire
employees.
now,
the
record
here
demonstrates
that
the
president
of
the
second
national
is
well
over
80
and
the
next
man
is
71
or
72
and
the
man
after
that
is
39
or
probably
40,
41.
the
head
of
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
is
now
about
73
and
the
next
man
is
about
61,
62
who
wants
to
retire
early
and
you
come
down
to
the
next
level,
it's
about
40
and
39.
now,
chinamann
(ph)
who
represented
the
largest
bank,
south
of
oxley,
the
huntington
county
national
bank
said
it's
too
late
to
go
out
and
try
to
do
it
alone.
you
have
to
have
a
merger.
a
greer
of
the
lafayette
trust
company,
a
former
bank
examiner
who
was
pulled
in
as
a
young
man
and
he
has
done
a
good
job
for
lafayette
trust
says
he
wants
to
go
to
the
$50
million
in
easton
and
he
says
he
can't
do
it
without
a
merger.
now,
let's
look
at
geographic
area.
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
the
philadelphia
national
case
that
they
would
take
the
four
county
area
where
the
banks
were
permitted
to
operate.
now
the
judge
in
this
case,
judge
sheldon,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
of
this
case,
lafayette
trust
recognized
that
there
was
pending
in
the
state
legislature
an
amendment
of
the
state
banking
law
which
would
allow
and
which
subsequently
was
enacted,
it
allows
in
seven
counties
of
new
jersey
branching,
branching
by
merger
or
de
novo
with
certain
home
office
protection.
seven,
counties,
the
complete
northern,
the
majority
of
the
state
with
over
three
million
people
an
area
very
much
like
that
which
was
adopted
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
competition
we're
likely
to
get.
now
this
applies
just
to
a
branch
banking
or
merging.
but
there's
statewide
bank
holding
so
that
you
can
have
any
bank
picked
up
by
a
bank
holding
process.
in
addition
to
that,
it
includes
savings
banks
as
well.
in
addition
to
that,
it
includes
savings
and
loans
which
can
move
into
the
area.
so
you
see
how
extensive
the
competition
is
and
already
warren
county
has
this
situation.
there
were
two
independent
banks
in
hackettstown.
there
were
two
independent
banks
in
washington,
one
12
miles
away,
the
other
about
22
miles
away.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
walmer
trupke
(ph),
one
of
the
most
outstanding
experts
who
teaches
at
n.y.u.
law
school
has
been
associated
with
the
finance
company
points
out
the
tremendous
competition
that
they
have.
i
think
in
philadelphia
national,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
finance
companies
get
most
of
their
money
from
banks.
he
says
this
is
untrue
to
(inaudible).
he
says
that
they
borrow
it
by
notes
on
less
than
270
days
from
the
leading
insurance
and
manufacturing
companies
for
instance
u.s.
steel
maybe
80
days
from
now,
we'll
have
to
make
a
tax
payment,
so
they'll
buy
some
notes
from
one
of
the
leading
finance
companies.
that
is
the
way
they
got
a
good
deal
of
their
money
and
walmer
trupke
(ph)
who
is
an
expert
here
has
testified
said
that
only
about
10%
of
the
finance
companies
get
their
money
from
the
banks.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
finance
there
--
three,
two
types
of
finance
companies.
there's
the
finance
company
that
takes
care
of
inventory
machinery
and
appliances
something
like
gmac,
gac,
cit
and
that
type
of
outfit
or
the
subsidiaries
of
general
electric
and
their
appliances.
that's
the
one
face
of
it.
the
other
is
the
small
loan
companies
which
are
at
a
very
large
outfit.
so
you
see,
what
i'm
just
going
to
say
now
about
the
warren
county
situation
we're
part
of
this
seven
county
area.
they're
closing
in
on
us
and
they're
closing
in
on
us
this
one.
shortly,
after
this
suit
was
started,
there
was
a
merger
between
the
washington
bank
in
--
the
hackettstown
bank,
pardon
me.
that
was
the
warren
county
national
bank.
that's
now
being
taken
over
by
the
largest
bank
in
the
state
first
national
bank,
state
bank,
that's
all
in
the
exhibit
--
intervenor's
exhibit
30.
so
those
two
banks
went
into
a
merger.
they
are
going
to
be
taken
over
by
a
bank
holding
company,
the
biggest
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
then
there's
the
washington
trust
company
which
is
12
miles
away
from
phillipsburg
and
which
had
a
branch
in
oxford
and
one
in
white
township
and
that's
being
taken
over
by
the
national
newark
and
essex
bank.
this
is
a
bank
with
just
about
14
to
15
million.
national
newark
and
essex
is
about
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
operating
over
newark.
the
only
other
independent
bank
we
now
have
in
hackettstown,
that's
being
taken
over
by
the
peoples
trust
company
at
the
hackensack
bank
which
is
about
number
five
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
intervenor's
exhibits,
you
will
see
very
clearly
that
they
allow
this
sort
of
thing
just
as
say
its
vital
right
for
the
national
and
newark
essex
to
come
in
and
take
the
washington
bank.
under
their
method
of
approach,
they
probably
say
it's
alright,
come
and
take
one
of
the
three
banks
in
phillipsburg.
now,
we
in
order
to
compete
with
easton,
bethlehem
and
allentown
in
order
to
compete
with
huntington
county
national
bank,
in
order
to
compete
in
this
first
district,
we
must
have
a
better
management
than
we
have.
now,
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
of
what
we
need.
it's
been
shown
that
we
tried
to
do
it.
now,
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no,
i
might
say
that
that
these
two
banks
or
three
banks
in
philipsburg
survived
the
depression
without
closing
more
than
the
normal
time.
but
we
have
served
the
community.
that's
our
chief
--
that's
our
chief
asset.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
i'm
sure
we
lost
some
during
the
depression
years,
1933,
--
1932,
1933,
1934
and
we
had
to
right
off
things
but
we
didn't
pay
dividends
for
a
long
while,
that's
true
but
in
recent
years,
it's
hardly
--
there's
hardly
a
bank
in
the
country
that's
really
lost
any
money
and
the
moment
you
lose
too
much,
it
looks
--
you
have
fdic
looking
over
your
shoulder,
a
receivership
takes
place
and
the
depositors
are
paid
off
and
we
have
strict
supervision
but
we
do
have
two
banks
that
are
designed
primarily
to
take
care
of
local
people.
now,
we've
had
a
testimony
of
william
greenly
and
we've
had
it
of
(inaudible).
they're
high
executives
in
the
leading
banks
in
newark,
some
of
the
banks
that
are
moving
into
this
area
and
they
were
asked
by
a
justice
about
participation
and
they
said,
“well,
you
know
things
get
tight
here
and
we
withdraw
or
we
don't
want
to
be
available.
and
we
are
not
interested
unless
you
have
a
skillful
--
a
skillful
mortgage
officer
or
a
skillful,
a
c&i
loan
officer
available
to
process
the
loan.”
so
consequently
there
is
this
need,
made
by
two
directors
of
phillipsburg
trust,
need
by
an
automobile
dealer,
25
requests
a
year
according
(inaudible),
the
vice
president,
about
17
according
to
dolbert
(ph),
the
second
national
officer.
this
is
the
need
that
we
want
to
meet
and
we
want
to
meet
and
we
want
to
be
a
commercial
bank.
this
is
the
area
that
we
want
to
serve
and
the
record
will
show
rather
completely
that
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
oh!
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we're
undercapitalized
right
now
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we're
undercapitalized.
our
relationship
of
capital
assets
toward
total
assets
is
only
about
5%,
it
should
be
near
10%.
second
national
is
about
7.5%
to
8%.
it
should
be
near
10%
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
merger
was
to
bring
these
two
banks
together
and
float
an
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no
we're
not.
justice
black,
we
are
not
doing
well
in
today's
line
of
commerce.
if
you
will
read
the
nattler
and
walich,
the
modern
day
bankers
and
you
read
this
testimony,
there's
that
great
amount
of
change
going
on
constantly
and
we
realize
that
this
change
is
going
on.
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
few
illustrations
that
we
have
changed.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we
are
not
closing
any
office.
there
will
be
the
same
number
of
offices.
there
will
be
better
service
to
the
customer
in
the
sense
that
we
can
loan
him
more.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
real
need
for
someone
who
understands
mortgage
loans.
a
real
definite
need
because
you
got
multiple
housing
coming
along.
you
can
no
longer
take
care
of
it
by
single
family
dwellings.
the
u.s.
savings
institutions
came
up
to
our
town
just
about
the
time
of
the
trial
and
just
gave
us
$695,000.00
loan
for
a
multiple
dwelling.
now
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
should
be
taking
care
of.
the
testimony
of
(inaudible)
shows
that
that
was
done
and
he
testified.
so
that
we
really
are
in
a
position
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that
was
by
the
u.s.
savings
bank
out
of
newark
and
this
is
the
stuff
we
should
be
taking
care
off.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
pardon?
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that's
right
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
service
the
loan,
a
good
deal
better
then
they
would
from
newark.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
oh
yes,
indeed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
policy
is
to
gather
the
other
two
banks
or
go
across
the
river
or
go
to
the
credential
insurance
company
or
go
to
other
banks
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
justice
white,
we
have
and
we
have
testimony
in
here
that
some
people
who
started
business
and
automobile
dealer,
mr.
whitman
and
another
person
who
is
in
the
chemical
business
couldn't
stay
with
us
because
they
couldn't
wait
for
the
time
it
took
for
us
to
process
the
papers
and
to
get
a
participating
loan.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
they
could
keep
the
loan
because
we
have
loads
of
evidence.
the
testimonies
were
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
we
could
but
the
testimony
is
such.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
there's
loads
of
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no,
not
because
we
are
competing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
lopatcong,
pohactong,
alphaburg,
and
phillipsburg
have
borrowed
from
phillipsburg
national
because
phillipsburg
national
has
gotten
together
with
second
national
and
phillipsburg
trust
to
service
the
community
and
they
get
a
better
loan
and
a
better
credit
rating
by
that
method
if
they
had
to
rely
on
newark
or
hackensack
or
a
passaic
or
a
patterson
bank.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
we
want
to
do.
this
isn't
any
manipulation.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
we
correspond
with
two
new
york
banks,
marine
midland
and
i
think
it
has
manufacturer
hanover
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
--
and
national
newark
and
essex.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
and
the
follow
banking
code
justice
white.
when
things
are
tightened
up
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
their
large
accounts,
they
tighten
up
on
us
and
they
don't
stay
with
us
and
they
don't
stay
with
that
customer
and
the
customer
doesn't
find
it.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
and
--
and
with
the
larger
customers,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
not
only
$200,000.00
justice
marshall
but
maybe
$300,000.00
or
$400,000.00
because
we
must
recapitalize
and
we've
been
delaying
it
as
a
result
of
this
merger
litigation.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that
is
correct
justice.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
this
is
--
justice
marshall,
this
is
what
we
are
hoping
to
avoid.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
but
what
you're
already
--
we
have
justice
at
this
moment
saying
if
someone
wants
a
loan
of
$250,000.00
go
on
over
to
easton
or
go
on
to
newark.
they're
--
they're
anticompetitive
in
a
sense.
they
don't
let
us
compete
with
the
area
across
the
river.
they
don't
let
us
compete
in
this
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
was
set
up
by
the
bureau
--
it
was
set
up
by
the
budget
bureau
and
it
is
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
our
statistics
demonstrate,
statistics
in
exhibit
six,
seven
and
eight
show
that
this
area
has
not
had
anywhere
near
the
concentration
that
existed
in
the
nashville
case.
it
--
it
has
the
least
concentration
except
one
in
some
49
cases.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
culmination
of
a
long
series
of
episodes
by
which
two
banks
endeavored
to
be
pro-competitive
in
an
extensive
area.
discussion
to
meet
the
problems
that
existed
as
between
older
management
and
younger
management
as
to
how
we
could
serve
the
customers
in
the
neighborhood,
the
people
who
were
in
need
of
loans
to
finance
various
enterprises,
all
of
those
problems
were
taken
into
consideration
and
it
was
felt
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
we
could
meet
the
problem
so
we
discuss
merger
and
then
in
1967
signed
an
agreement
and
then
filed
an
application
with
the
comptroller.
the
three
agencies,
not
through
their
somber
boards
but
rather
through
a
bureaucratic
employees
took
the
narrow
blind
view
that
only
easton
was
a
market
or
easton
and
phillipsburg
was
a
market,
that
they
submitted
that
various
reports
but
then
there
was
a
full
and
adequate
hearing
before
the
comptroller,
justice
shows
not
to
appear
on
the
scene.
then
we
produce
witnesses
and
then
a
decision
was
arrived
at
that
this
was
an
area
somewhat
similar
to
the
standard,
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
is
set
forth
in
white
in
this
exhibit,
exhibit
13.
then
we
found
that
after
we
are
ready
to
go
with
the
merger,
justice
starts
a
suit.
then
we
go
to
the
district
court
in
new
jersey
where
we
have
1600
pages
of
testimony,
where
we
have
over
100
exhibits,
where
we're
put
to
untold
difficulty
in
getting
out
records
as
to
duplicate
depositors
in
each
bank,
furnishing
infinite
information
then
the
judge
became
ill
after
the
conclusion
of
the
case
and
we
waited
a
year
for
a
decision
and
now
this
suit
is
here
before
you.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
three
things.
number
one,
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
this
is
procompetitive.
there
isn't
one
witness,
least
of
all
mr.
lupo
who
says
that
this
is
anticompetitive.
at
most
he
said
in
--
and
i
refer
you
to
the
appendix
in
page
35,
in
the
record
it's
probably
page
134,
he
was
asked
about
the
competition
between
his
bank,
that
is
the
third
largest
bank
and
two
existing
banks
in
phillipsburg
and
he
said,
“i
would
say
it
was
healthy
competition,
healthy
competition
to
the
extent
that
we
have
grown,
that
we
have
recognized
and
we
have
progressed.
i
would
say
it
was
healthy
competition.”
and
the
court,
“when
you
defined
it
as
healthy
competition,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you
consider
this
competition
as
a
factor
in
your
own
growth.”
then
i
say
to
you,
if
you
read
the
record
1600
pages,
you
can
not
find
one
of
the
people
who
as
bankers
appeared
on
the
scene
to
say
that
this
was
anticompetitive,
not
one.
the
--
the
--
we'll
take
mr.
greenly
of
the
second
largest
bank
in
new
jersey.
he
looked
over
the
entire
situation.
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
premium
on
any
of
the
exchange
of
shares
like
there
was
in
the
national
case.
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
fair
exchange
and
that
it
was
--
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
would
cause
customers
to
have
to
pay
the
toll
or
pay
anything
additional.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
most
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
i
think
the
customer
that
we're
talking
about
--
the
customer
that
mr.
friedman
has
also
listed
is
about,
he
will
have
five
choices
instead
of
two
and
one
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
and
the
--
and
the
customer
will
not
be
heard
because
the
charges
are
essentially
the
same
for
checking
accounts
and
more
and
more
since
there
is
a
better
return
on
time
deposits,
most
of
the
money
is
going
under
the
time
deposit
area
and
you
take
william
jones,
william
f.
jones
of
the
easton
bank.
he
specifically
pointed
out
that
this
would
be
procompetitive.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we
had
at
least
ten
witnesses
who
appear,
appliance
dealers,
automobile
dealers,
manufacturers,
industry
people
who
pointed
out
that
their
needs
were
well
in
excess
of
$200,000.00.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
borrowers
from
our
bank
are
directors
of
the
phillipsburg
trust
company
and
they
testified
for
us
saying
that
they
felt
that
they
would
be
better
served
if
these
banks
were
merged
and
they
could
have
a
larger
borrowing
limit.
mr.
riccardi
and
mr.
falk,
mr.
falk
who
operates
outside
of
phillipsburg
a
tremendous
market
outside
of
easton
one,
outside
and
two
outside
of
allentown.
these
are
the
people
who
--
the
testimonies
replete.
there
isn't
one
as
there
is
in
these
previous
cases,
there
isn't
one
person
or
one
banker
who
came
in
and
said
this
will
affect
the
community,
this
will
hurt
the
community.
everyone
was
willing
to
--
most
people
were
willing
to
testify
and
no
one
testified
against
it
except
mr.
edwards
who
was
a
young
phd
with
a
j.d.
degree
at
the
age
of
31
and
who
on
the
basis
of
casual
empiricism
arrived
at
the
conclusion
by
his
doctoral
thesis
on
the
basis
of
standard
statistical
standard,
metropolitan
statistical
area
that
he
has
examined
some
49
of
them
and
he
examined
them
in
terms
of
what
happened
in
1955
and
1957
and
he
concluded
that
when
you
had
a
merger
of
this
sort,
interest
rates
on
savings
deposits
were
reduced
and
interests
on
loans
were
increased.
this
was
contradicted
by
all
of
our
experts,
contradicted
by
bankers.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes
as
was
--
as
was
pointed
out
in
nashville
and
philadelphia,
two
banks
will
be
better
able
to
compete
with
other
banks
in
any
of
these
areas.
now,
let's
just
take
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
that
you
have
the
large
banks
in
allentown,
you
have
the
large
banks
in
bethlehem,
you
have
a
large
bank
south
of
us
and
no
one
in
phillipsburg
can
get
a
loan
in
excess
of
$100,000.00.
he's
got
to
go
to
the
other
neighborhoods.
now,
he
can
get
a
larger
loan
and
i
think
it
was
recognized
in
the
nashville
case
that
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
did
remedy
that
situation,
that
situation
of
larger
loan
limit
and
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
was
sort
of
held
out
because
it
was
felt
that
the
bank
merger
act
prevented
them,
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
but
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966,
i
think,
by
the
nashville
case
indicated
that
it
could
--
that
would
be
one
of
the
factors
and
another
factor
would
be
the
management,
a
better
opportunity
to
hire
employees.
now,
the
record
here
demonstrates
that
the
president
of
the
second
national
is
well
over
80
and
the
next
man
is
71
or
72
and
the
man
after
that
is
39
or
probably
40,
41.
the
head
of
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
is
now
about
73
and
the
next
man
is
about
61,
62
who
wants
to
retire
early
and
you
come
down
to
the
next
level,
it's
about
40
and
39.
now,
chinamann
(ph)
who
represented
the
largest
bank,
south
of
oxley,
the
huntington
county
national
bank
said
it's
too
late
to
go
out
and
try
to
do
it
alone.
you
have
to
have
a
merger.
a
greer
of
the
lafayette
trust
company,
a
former
bank
examiner
who
was
pulled
in
as
a
young
man
and
he
has
done
a
good
job
for
lafayette
trust
says
he
wants
to
go
to
the
$50
million
in
easton
and
he
says
he
can't
do
it
without
a
merger.
now,
let's
look
at
geographic
area.
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
the
philadelphia
national
case
that
they
would
take
the
four
county
area
where
the
banks
were
permitted
to
operate.
now
the
judge
in
this
case,
judge
sheldon,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
of
this
case,
lafayette
trust
recognized
that
there
was
pending
in
the
state
legislature
an
amendment
of
the
state
banking
law
which
would
allow
and
which
subsequently
was
enacted,
it
allows
in
seven
counties
of
new
jersey
branching,
branching
by
merger
or
de
novo
with
certain
home
office
protection.
seven,
counties,
the
complete
northern,
the
majority
of
the
state
with
over
three
million
people
an
area
very
much
like
that
which
was
adopted
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
now,
this
is
the
kind
of
competition
we're
likely
to
get.
now
this
applies
just
to
a
branch
banking
or
merging.
but
there's
statewide
bank
holding
so
that
you
can
have
any
bank
picked
up
by
a
bank
holding
process.
in
addition
to
that,
it
includes
savings
banks
as
well.
in
addition
to
that,
it
includes
savings
and
loans
which
can
move
into
the
area.
so
you
see
how
extensive
the
competition
is
and
already
warren
county
has
this
situation.
there
were
two
independent
banks
in
hackettstown.
there
were
two
independent
banks
in
washington,
one
12
miles
away,
the
other
about
22
miles
away.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
walmer
trupke
(ph),
one
of
the
most
outstanding
experts
who
teaches
at
n.y.u.
law
school
has
been
associated
with
the
finance
company
points
out
the
tremendous
competition
that
they
have.
i
think
in
philadelphia
national,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
finance
companies
get
most
of
their
money
from
banks.
he
says
this
is
untrue
to
(inaudible).
he
says
that
they
borrow
it
by
notes
on
less
than
270
days
from
the
leading
insurance
and
manufacturing
companies
for
instance
u.s.
steel
maybe
80
days
from
now,
we'll
have
to
make
a
tax
payment,
so
they'll
buy
some
notes
from
one
of
the
leading
finance
companies.
that
is
the
way
they
got
a
good
deal
of
their
money
and
walmer
trupke
(ph)
who
is
an
expert
here
has
testified
said
that
only
about
10%
of
the
finance
companies
get
their
money
from
the
banks.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
finance
there
--
three,
two
types
of
finance
companies.
there's
the
finance
company
that
takes
care
of
inventory
machinery
and
appliances
something
like
gmac,
gac,
cit
and
that
type
of
outfit
or
the
subsidiaries
of
general
electric
and
their
appliances.
that's
the
one
face
of
it.
the
other
is
the
small
loan
companies
which
are
at
a
very
large
outfit.
so
you
see,
what
i'm
just
going
to
say
now
about
the
warren
county
situation
we're
part
of
this
seven
county
area.
they're
closing
in
on
us
and
they're
closing
in
on
us
this
one.
shortly,
after
this
suit
was
started,
there
was
a
merger
between
the
washington
bank
in
--
the
hackettstown
bank,
pardon
me.
that
was
the
warren
county
national
bank.
that's
now
being
taken
over
by
the
largest
bank
in
the
state
first
national
bank,
state
bank,
that's
all
in
the
exhibit
--
intervenor's
exhibit
30.
so
those
two
banks
went
into
a
merger.
they
are
going
to
be
taken
over
by
a
bank
holding
company,
the
biggest
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
then
there's
the
washington
trust
company
which
is
12
miles
away
from
phillipsburg
and
which
had
a
branch
in
oxford
and
one
in
white
township
and
that's
being
taken
over
by
the
national
newark
and
essex
bank.
this
is
a
bank
with
just
about
14
to
15
million.
national
newark
and
essex
is
about
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
operating
over
newark.
the
only
other
independent
bank
we
now
have
in
hackettstown,
that's
being
taken
over
by
the
peoples
trust
company
at
the
hackensack
bank
which
is
about
number
five
bank
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
intervenor's
exhibits,
you
will
see
very
clearly
that
they
allow
this
sort
of
thing
just
as
say
its
vital
right
for
the
national
and
newark
essex
to
come
in
and
take
the
washington
bank.
under
their
method
of
approach,
they
probably
say
it's
alright,
come
and
take
one
of
the
three
banks
in
phillipsburg.
now,
we
in
order
to
compete
with
easton,
bethlehem
and
allentown
in
order
to
compete
with
huntington
county
national
bank,
in
order
to
compete
in
this
first
district,
we
must
have
a
better
management
than
we
have.
now,
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
of
what
we
need.
it's
been
shown
that
we
tried
to
do
it.
now,
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no,
i
might
say
that
that
these
two
banks
or
three
banks
in
philipsburg
survived
the
depression
without
closing
more
than
the
normal
time.
but
we
have
served
the
community.
that's
our
chief
--
that's
our
chief
asset.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
i'm
sure
we
lost
some
during
the
depression
years,
1933,
--
1932,
1933,
1934
and
we
had
to
right
off
things
but
we
didn't
pay
dividends
for
a
long
while,
that's
true
but
in
recent
years,
it's
hardly
--
there's
hardly
a
bank
in
the
country
that's
really
lost
any
money
and
the
moment
you
lose
too
much,
it
looks
--
you
have
fdic
looking
over
your
shoulder,
a
receivership
takes
place
and
the
depositors
are
paid
off
and
we
have
strict
supervision
but
we
do
have
two
banks
that
are
designed
primarily
to
take
care
of
local
people.
now,
we've
had
a
testimony
of
william
greenly
and
we've
had
it
of
(inaudible).
they're
high
executives
in
the
leading
banks
in
newark,
some
of
the
banks
that
are
moving
into
this
area
and
they
were
asked
by
a
justice
about
participation
and
they
said,
“well,
you
know
things
get
tight
here
and
we
withdraw
or
we
don't
want
to
be
available.
and
we
are
not
interested
unless
you
have
a
skillful
--
a
skillful
mortgage
officer
or
a
skillful,
a
c&i
loan
officer
available
to
process
the
loan.”
so
consequently
there
is
this
need,
made
by
two
directors
of
phillipsburg
trust,
need
by
an
automobile
dealer,
25
requests
a
year
according
(inaudible),
the
vice
president,
about
17
according
to
dolbert
(ph),
the
second
national
officer.
this
is
the
need
that
we
want
to
meet
and
we
want
to
meet
and
we
want
to
be
a
commercial
bank.
this
is
the
area
that
we
want
to
serve
and
the
record
will
show
rather
completely
that
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
oh!
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we're
undercapitalized
right
now
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we're
undercapitalized.
our
relationship
of
capital
assets
toward
total
assets
is
only
about
5%,
it
should
be
near
10%.
second
national
is
about
7.5%
to
8%.
it
should
be
near
10%
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
merger
was
to
bring
these
two
banks
together
and
float
an
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no
we're
not.
justice
black,
we
are
not
doing
well
in
today's
line
of
commerce.
if
you
will
read
the
nattler
and
walich,
the
modern
day
bankers
and
you
read
this
testimony,
there's
that
great
amount
of
change
going
on
constantly
and
we
realize
that
this
change
is
going
on.
i
just
want
to
give
you
a
few
illustrations
that
we
have
changed.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
we
are
not
closing
any
office.
there
will
be
the
same
number
of
offices.
there
will
be
better
service
to
the
customer
in
the
sense
that
we
can
loan
him
more.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
real
need
for
someone
who
understands
mortgage
loans.
a
real
definite
need
because
you
got
multiple
housing
coming
along.
you
can
no
longer
take
care
of
it
by
single
family
dwellings.
the
u.s.
savings
institutions
came
up
to
our
town
just
about
the
time
of
the
trial
and
just
gave
us
$695,000.00
loan
for
a
multiple
dwelling.
now
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
should
be
taking
care
of.
the
testimony
of
(inaudible)
shows
that
that
was
done
and
he
testified.
so
that
we
really
are
in
a
position
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that
was
by
the
u.s.
savings
bank
out
of
newark
and
this
is
the
stuff
we
should
be
taking
care
off.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
pardon?
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that's
right
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
service
the
loan,
a
good
deal
better
then
they
would
from
newark.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
oh
yes,
indeed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
policy
is
to
gather
the
other
two
banks
or
go
across
the
river
or
go
to
the
credential
insurance
company
or
go
to
other
banks
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
justice
white,
we
have
and
we
have
testimony
in
here
that
some
people
who
started
business
and
automobile
dealer,
mr.
whitman
and
another
person
who
is
in
the
chemical
business
couldn't
stay
with
us
because
they
couldn't
wait
for
the
time
it
took
for
us
to
process
the
papers
and
to
get
a
participating
loan.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
they
could
keep
the
loan
because
we
have
loads
of
evidence.
the
testimonies
were
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
we
could
but
the
testimony
is
such.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
there's
loads
of
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
no,
not
because
we
are
competing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
lopatcong,
pohactong,
alphaburg,
and
phillipsburg
have
borrowed
from
phillipsburg
national
because
phillipsburg
national
has
gotten
together
with
second
national
and
phillipsburg
trust
to
service
the
community
and
they
get
a
better
loan
and
a
better
credit
rating
by
that
method
if
they
had
to
rely
on
newark
or
hackensack
or
a
passaic
or
a
patterson
bank.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
we
want
to
do.
this
isn't
any
manipulation.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
yes,
we
correspond
with
two
new
york
banks,
marine
midland
and
i
think
it
has
manufacturer
hanover
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
--
and
national
newark
and
essex.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
well,
and
the
follow
banking
code
justice
white.
when
things
are
tightened
up
so
that
they
can
take
care
of
their
large
accounts,
they
tighten
up
on
us
and
they
don't
stay
with
us
and
they
don't
stay
with
that
customer
and
the
customer
doesn't
find
it.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
and
--
and
with
the
larger
customers,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
not
only
$200,000.00
justice
marshall
but
maybe
$300,000.00
or
$400,000.00
because
we
must
recapitalize
and
we've
been
delaying
it
as
a
result
of
this
merger
litigation.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
that
is
correct
justice.
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
this
is
--
justice
marshall,
this
is
what
we
are
hoping
to
avoid.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
robert
b.
meyner
but
what
you're
already
--
we
have
justice
at
this
moment
saying
if
someone
wants
a
loan
of
$250,000.00
go
on
over
to
easton
or
go
on
to
newark.
they're
--
they're
anticompetitive
in
a
sense.
they
don't
let
us
compete
with
the
area
across
the
river.
they
don't
let
us
compete
in
this
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
was
set
up
by
the
bureau
--
it
was
set
up
by
the
budget
bureau
and
it
is
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
our
statistics
demonstrate,
statistics
in
exhibit
six,
seven
and
eight
show
that
this
area
has
not
had
anywhere
near
the
concentration
that
existed
in
the
nashville
case.
it
--
it
has
the
least
concentration
except
one
in
some
49
cases.
thank
you.
