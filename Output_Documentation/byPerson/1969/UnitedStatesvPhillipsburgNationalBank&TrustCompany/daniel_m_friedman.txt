mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
there
which
after
trial
dismissed
a
government
civil
antitrust
suit
challenging
the
merger
of
two
banks
in
the
town
of
phillipsburg,
new
jersey
as
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
appeal
presents
a
number
of
important
questions
as
to
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
courts
in
passing
upon
the
application
of
section
7
to
small
bank
mergers
and
also
as
to
the
correctness
of
certain
rulings
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
in
upholding
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
that
congress
wrote
into
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
as
a
permissible
basis
of
justifying
anticompetitive
mergers.
before
discussing
the
facts
in
these
legal
issues
however,
i
just
briefly
like
to
explain
to
the
court
why
the
government
considers
this
an
important
case
and
why
the
government
has
brought
to
this
case
a
factual
situation
and
on
its
face
does
not
seem
to
be
of
the
greatest
economic
significance.
ten
and
15
years
ago,
we
had
in
this
country
a
great
wave
of
tremendous
bank
mergers.
multibillion
dollar
institutions
combine,
institutions
involving
hundreds
of
million
dollars
combined
in
the
large
metropolitan
areas,
new
york
city,
philadelphia,
chicago,
houston
and
so
on.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
1963
in
the
philadelphia
bank
merger
case
and
a
series
of
other
decisions
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
the
focus
of
the
whole
trend
of
bank
mergers
has
shifted.
today,
we
no
longer
have
this
pattern
of
large
bank
mergers
in
the
big
city.
those
seemed
to
be
a
thing
of
the
past
because
under
this
court's
decisions,
these
combinations
and
these
very
large
highly
concentrated
markets
are
illegal.
what
we
have
instead
is
a
developing
trend
of
mergers
along
the
smaller
banks
in
the
smaller
areas
and
in
the
past
four
or
five
years,
virtually
all
of
the
justice
departments,
bank
merger
suits
have
been
brought
against
this
type
of
merger.
the
reason
we
have
brought
these
cases
is
we
think
that
since
in
the
smaller
marketing
areas,
the
very
nature
of
banking
tends
to
make
it
a
concentrated
market,
a
relatively
small
number
of
banks
and
since
in
the
smaller
communities,
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
the
people
particularly
affected
the
small
borrowers.
most
of
the
small
banks
tend
to
be
primarily
concerned
with
small
customer.
we
think
it's
particularly
important
in
these
smaller
markets
to
preserve
for
banking
customers
the
available
alternatives
of
choice
that
is
to
make
sure
that
in
these
markets,
they
already
tend
to
be
concentrated.
they
do
not
take
place
a
large
number
of
bank
mergers
which
further
reduce
the
available
alternatives
and
that's
why
we
think
this
particular
type
of
situation.
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
come
before
this
court
involving
so-called
small
bank
mergers
and
that's
why
we
have
brought
the
case
and
we
think
it's
an
important
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
in
the
district
courts,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
these
cases,
we
have
lost
i
have
to
admit
it,
unfortunately,
several
of
these
cases
in
the
district
courts,
if
we
happen
to
appealed
because
these
cases
under
the
expediting
act,
all
of
these
bank
merger
cases
come
directly
from
the
district
court
to
this
court.
there
have
been
other
case,
bank
merger
cases,
involving
other
issues
in
the
courts
of
appeals
but
there
have
been
no
--
none
of
the
government
suits
challenging
bank
mergers
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
there
have
been
any
in
which
have
actually
gone
into
trial.
i
think
there
are
some
that
have
been
appending
and
i
think
there
have
been
a
couple
in
which
we
brought
a
suit
in
the
merger
terminated
at
that
point.
now,
let
me
with
this
background
come
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
phillipsburg,
new
jersey
is
an
industrial
community
with
a
population
of
about
18,000
including
the
surrounding
suburban
area
of
the
town
that
has
28,000.
it
is
directly
across
the
delaware
river
from
the
city
of
easton,
pennsylvania,
a
larger
city
with
a
population
of
32,000
and
in
the
environs
approximately
60,000.
the
two
cities
are
very
close
together.
they
are
connected
by
two
bridges,
one
of
which
is
free
and
other
of
which
has
a
charge
for
commuters
of
$2.50
crossing.
there
is
a
very
close
business
and
commercial
relationship
between
the
two
towns.
people
go
back
and
forth
from
the
two
towns
to
shop.
people
go
back
and
forth
to
work
and
as
a
businessman
in
phillipsburg
described
it,
he
said
that
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
is
in
effect
really
is
one
town.
like
so
many
of
the
cities
these
days,
the
central
areas
of
both
of
these
communities
have
not
had
much
growth.
it
has
become
rather
stagnant
in
recent
years.
its
population
has
remained
quite
stable.
on
the
other
hand,
the
surrounding
areas
have
grown
both
in
terms
of
population
and
industry.
the
town
of
phillipsburg
has
three
banks.
the
town
of
easton
has
four
banks,
one
of
which
is
a
branch
of
a
bank
in
the
easton
suburbs.
it
is
where
the
main
office
is
located,
a
few
miles
away
in
the
city,
town
of
nazareth,
pennsylvania.
the
acquiring
bank
in
this
case,
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
is
the
largest
in
phillipsburg
and
the
third
largest
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
in
1967
and
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
latest
date
for
which
data
are
in
the
record,
the
assets
were
approximately
$24
million.
it
has
its
main
office
in
the
downtown
part
of
town.
it
has
two
branches
in
the
suburban
areas
that
had
opened
in
1964.
the
acquired
bank,
the
second
national
bank
of
phillipsburg
is
the
second
largest
in
that
town
and
the
fifth
largest
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
it
has
assets
of
$17
million,
a
little
less
than
that
of
phillipsburg
national.
its
main
office
in
phillipsburg
is
directly
across
the
street
from
that
of
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
and
it
has
one
branch
in
the
suburbs
again
across
the
highway
from
one
of
the
branches
of
phillipsburg
national
and
it
says
apparent
from
the
facts
that
these
two
banks
are
direct
competitors.
both
of
these
banks
in
recent
years
have
undergone
substantial
growth
and
both
of
them
profitable.
in
the
10-year
period
from
1957
to
1967,
phillipsburg
national
doubled
its
assets
and
deposits
and
tripled
its
loans.
in
the
same
period,
1957
and
1967,
second
national
increased
its
assets
82%,
its
deposits
86%,
and
again
tripled
its
loans.
for
the
years
1962
to
1967,
except
for
one
year
in
which
phillipsburg
national
showed
a
deficit
because
of
various
accounting
changes
that
are
employed,
each
year
it
had
substantial
profits.
as
to
taxes,
they
ranged
from
$46,000.00
to
$123,000.00
and
over
that
same
five-year
period
phillipsburg
national
paid
total
dividends
of
$192,000.00.
similarly,
the
second
national
bank
in
this
five-year
period
every
year
has
substantial
earnings
ranging
from
$35,000.00
to
$73,000.00
and
it
paid
total
dividends
in
that
period
of
$198,000.00.
now,
both
of
these
banks
provide
a
full
range
of
the
traditional
and
usual
banking
services.
they
accept
demand
deposits,
savings
and
time
deposits;
they
provided
checking
service;
they
make
various
types
of
the
usual
loans,
commercial
and
industrial
loans,
mortgage
loans,
installment
loans,
consumer
loans;
they
have
safe
deposit
boxes,
etcetera.
unlike
the
large
city
bank,
however,
these
banks
is
apparently
as
typical
of
most
banks
in
the
smaller
communities,
have
a
much
heavier
percentage
of
their
deposits
in
time
and
savings
deposits
and
a
much
lower
percentage
of
their
deposits
than
the
demand
deposits
because
of
the
fact
that
this
community
just
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
heavy
industry
that
we
have
in
the
large
cities
and
similarly,
in
terms
of
their
loans,
a
much
greater
percentage
of
their
loans
were
in
real
estate
loans
in
the
big
city
banks
and
a
much
smaller
percentage
in
commercial
and
industrial
loans.
the
banking
market
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
areas
are
concentrated
one.
the
two
top
banks,
both
in
easton
have
approximately
50%
of
the
assets,
almost
50%
of
the
loans
and
55%
of
deposits
and
when
we
take
the
three
leading
banks
which
include
the
phillipsburg
national
bank,
it
comes
to
roughly
60%
of
assets,
65%
of
deposits
and
65%
of
loans.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
there
is
a
substantial
extent
of
social
and
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
towns
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
good
bid
of
movement
back
and
forth
between
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
and
the
surrounding
areas
of
the
country.
this
was
originally
a
rural
farming
country
and
as
there's
been
increasing
population
growth
and
industry,
a
large
number
of
smaller
towns
have
developed
and
in
fact
the
evidence
shows
that
people
who
live
in
phillipsburg-easton
frequently
go
outside
of
the
area
to
work,
that
people
who
live
in
the
outside
area
come
to
phillipsburg,
and
that
people
from
phillipsburg-easton
go
as
far
as
allentown
and
bethlehem,
pennsylvania
20
or
30
miles
to
shopping,
but,
and
we
think
this
is
critical
and
i
will
develop
it
in
more
detail
in
a
little
later.
the
record
shows
that
the
two
merging
banks
do
the
vast
bulk
of
their
business
of
all
types
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
now,
with
this
as
the
background,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
showed
--
there
are
various
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
particular
banks,
the
testimony
generally
as
in
most
instances,
they
get
a
very
small
part
of
their
business.
they
get
some
but
in
terms
of
percentages
for
example,
the
record
showing
that
some
banks
get
only
a
handful,
though
some
one
bank
had
testified
they
just
had
a
three
or
four
loans
in
phillipsburg.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
few
of
those,
not
many.
i
think
for
example
in
the
trust
business,
they
get
more
of
those,
but
basically,
i
think
the
bankers
themselves
testified
that
--
the
phillipsburg
bankers
testified
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
business
of
the
merging
bank
comes
from
this
area
and
we
also
had
testimony
of
a
number
of
bankers
from
the
outside
area
who
generally
indicated
that
the
bulk
of
their
business
came
from
their
area.
they
all
said,
“yes,
we
have
a
few
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
their
immediate
location.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
tend
to
--
the
banks
in
this
area
tend
to
pretty
much
stick
to
their
own
little
preserve
four,
five-mile
radius
or
something
like
that.
that's
what
the
evidence
seems
to
show
in
this
case.
they
don't
seem
actively
to
go
out
into
the
areas
10
to
15
miles
away.
they
do
some
soliciting.
they
have
some
newspaper
as
to
by
enlarged,
they
stick
to
their
own
areas.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
trust
departments,
the
two
merging
banks
have
with
all
kind
or
rather
inadequate
trust
departments.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
the
bank
in
easton,
there's
a
bank
in
easton
that
has
one
of
a
very
fine
trust
department,
and
in
addition,
of
course
bank
--
and
there's
another
bank
that
does
business
in
easton
that
has
a
large
trust
department.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
in
allen
--
well,
there's
another
bank,
i
think
one
of
the
banks
that
is
outside
of
easton,
not
in
allentown
and
bethlehem
that
does
trust
business
and
has
a
branch
in
easton
and
then
of
course
the
banks
in
allentown
and
bethlehem
which
are
much
larger
than
any
of
these
banks
have
extensive
trust
business.
and
they
do
get,
there
is
evidence
that
these
outside
banks
do
get
trust
business,
of
course,
and
this
tend
to
be
by
enlarge
the
larger
accounts,
of
course
the
trust
business.
now,
the
district
court
in
this
case
basically
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
made
about
three
or
four
rulings
that
are
significant
here.
the
court
in
this
case
said
that
because
a
large
number
of
other
financial
types
of
institutions
are
competing
in
the
area
with
the
banks
that
the
relevant
market
for
testing
competitive
effect
in
this
case
was
not
commercial
banking
as
such.
he
pointed
--
the
district
judge
pointed
to
the
fact
the
two
had
saving
and
loans
association,
the
two
had
finance
companies,
the
two
had
mutual
funds
that
were
seeking
to
obtain
the
savings
deposits
of
the
customers,
the
two
had
finance
organization
seeking
loans
and
the
court,
therefore,
has
concluded
that
the
appropriate
line
of
commerce
for
the
testing
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
those
particular
services
rendered
by
the
bank
as
to
which
really
there
was
no
significant
competition.
and
the
services
the
court
included
in
its
line
of
commerce
with
checking
accounts,
savings
accounts,
certificates
of
deposits,
personal
loans,
consumer
and
installment
loans
and
commercial
and
industrial
loans.
but
then
rather
inconsistent
with
this
theory
when
the
court
came
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
by
examining
the
concentration
ratios
and
the
increases
in
concentration,
the
court
looked
to
the
figures
dealing
with
commercial
banking,
not
with
the
subcategories
of
commercial
banking
which
court
believed
was
the
relevant
market.
so
what
it
amounts
to,
it
seems
to
us,
it's
really
kind
of
a
dictum,
the
court
said
it
didn't
think
that
commercial
banking
was
the
relevant
market
then
it
turned
around
and
in
fact
tested
this
by
commercial
banking.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
didn't
say
it
explicitly
but
the
court
in
its
opinion
discussed
all
the
figures
relating
to
commercial
banking
as
a
line
of
commerce.
now,
on
the
geographic
market,
we
have
distributed
to
the
court
this
little,
three-colored
map.
mr.
meyner
in
behalf
of
the
banks
has
objected
to
the
distribution
of
this
map
on
the
ground
that
this
map
was
offered
in
evidence
at
the
trial
court
and
was
objected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that's
--
well,
he
only
claims
that
it
was
rejected
because
he
claims
it
distorts
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
intend
to
indicate
that
mr.
justice.
this
was
just
attempting
to
show
the
geographical
area.
there's
a
patchwork
of
roads
or
extensive
highways.
there's
whole
lot
of
little
towns.
what
we
--
the
reason
we
submitted
this
is
because
as
the
district
court
defined
the
market,
the
district
court
listed
about
30
or
40
communities
and
said
i
find
that
this
is
the
market
and
when
you
just
list
communities,
unless
one
is
familiar
with
this
particular
section
of
the
country,
it's
difficult
to
see
precisely
what
is
involved
and
we
do
not
claim
that
this
is
exactly
accurate.
it's
just
a
rough
approximation,
but
i
think
with
the
colors,
it
will
indicate
basically
what
is
the
area
of
dispute
here.
the
government
have
proposed
in
the
district
court
that
the
relevant
market
could
be
one
of
two
areas.
either
the
phillipsburg
area
itself
which
is
in
that
part
we
have
colored
pink,
or
the
combination
of
phillipsburg
and
easton
which
is
colored
blue.
the
defendants
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
suggested
a
much
broader
market.
the
district
court
selected
a
market
somewhere
in
between
which
is
the
part
colored
green
which
appears
to
be
roughly
four
times
the
size
of
armored
market
and
is
also
is
shown
by
this
map.
the
district
court
included
in
its
relevant
market
the
city
of
bethlehem
over
to
the
extreme
left
and
drew
the
line
right
between
bethlehem
and
allentown
even
though
allentown
is
contiguous
to
bethlehem
and
in
effect
is
almost
a
continuation
of
it.
now,
within
this
market,
the
court
concluded
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
comptroller
was
a
market
which
was
basically
most
of
the
lehigh
valley,
and
most
of
this
large
section
here,
where
it
kind
goes
takes
part
--
it's
again
i
would
say
another
oblong
thing
around
this
market
and
it
was
included
part
of
bucks
county,
part
of
huntingdon
county,
larger
than
we
had
proposed.
and
they
also
suggested
the
--
perhaps
the
entire
lehigh,
--
allentown,
bethlehem,
easton,
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
is
an
even
larger
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
reading,
i
believe,
is
north
of
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
west
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice.
now,
within
this
broader
area
that
the
court
selected,
it
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
lesson
of
competition.
there
was
no
trend
toward
present
or
future
concentration.
the
merging
banks
had
only
six
and
three
quarter
percent
of
all
banking
assets
and
after
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
then
said
that
that
far
as
it
was
concerned
really
was
the
end
of
the
case,
but
since
the
convenience
and
needs
pointed
have
been
so
fully
canvassed,
it
would
also
rule
on
that,
and
it
then
held
that
the
banks
had
sustained
the
burden
of
proving
this
merger
was
justified
by
community
convenience
and
need
relying
primarily
on
two
factors
that
the
merger
would
result
in
the
lend
--
the
new
bank
having
a
much
larger
lending
limit
than
the
old
bank
and
that
it
would
permit
the
bank
for
the
first
time
to
employ
a
full
time
trust
officer
which
would
enable
it
to
build
up
a
trust
department
for
which
it
found
there
was
need
in
the
area.
and
in
deciding
the
convenience
and
need
point,
rather
interestingly
and
we
think
erroneously,
although
the
court
had
used
the
broad
geographical
market
for
determining
competitive
impact,
it
evaluated
the
needs
of
the
community
solely
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
phillipsburg,
not
phillipsburg-easton
but
just
phillipsburg.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
out
to
the
legal
issues
in
the
case.
the
first
one
is
the
so-called
product
market
by
the
commercial
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
--
as
it's
required
under
the
bank
holding
company
act,
the
matter
was
submitted
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
justice
department,
all
of
whom
advised
the
comptroller
in
their
view
the
merger
would
have
adverse
effects
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
merger
would
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
competition
and
indeed
the
two
banking
agencies
in
their
recommendation
viewed
phillipsburg
primarily
as
the
relevant
market.
the
comptroller
held
a
hearing
and
after
the
hearing
ruled
that
the
merger
did
not
have
the
anticompetitive
effects
primarily
again
because
the
comptroller
viewed
the
market
much
more
broadly
than
the
banking
agencies
have.
now,
there's
a
--
the
appellees
argue
at
considerable
length
as
to
why
commercial
banking
in
this
market
is
not
the
appropriate
product
and
that
the
district
court
therefore
correctly
rejected
that
line
of
commerce.
at
page
61
of
their
brief,
however,
the
bank's
record
that
the
government
in
any
event
hasn't
been
prejudiced
by
any
possible
error
in
this
thing
and
they
admitted
the
issue
is
no
longer
really
in
the
case
because
of
the
fact
that
in
deciding
the
effect
on
competition,
the
district
court
did
look
to
commercial
banking.
we
have
briefly
discussed
in
our
brief
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
in
this
case
as
in
all
the
banking
cases
before
this
court,
commercial
banking
is
an
appropriate
product
market
within
which
to
test
the
thing.
but
in
view
of
the
fact,
as
i
said
that
issue
no
longer
really
seems
to
be
a
real
life
or
in
the
case,
i
think
i
will
leave
the
discussion
to
our
brief
on
this
point.
now,
coming
to
the
first
of
the
critical
issues
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
because
we
have
to
win
on
this
case
to
seek,
i
would
get
a
reversal
here,
and
i
might
just
add
in
passing
that
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
reverse
and
remand
to
the
district
court
to
reconsider
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
under
what
we
think
is
the
proper
determination
that
the
merger
had
an
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
relevant
market.
the
--
this
court
in
the
pabst
case
recognized
that
just
as
with
products
so
in
the
case
of
geographic
areas
there
may
be
more
than
one
geographic
area
that
is
relevant.
in
pabst,
the
court
recognized
that
there
were
three
different
markets,
three
large
markets.
the
district
court
said
here
however
that
said
that
it
concluded
that
the
relevant
market,
that
was
the
word
used,
“the
relevant
market”
was
this
area
that
it
had
selected.
now,
there
may
be
situations
in
which
this
larger
market
is
an
appropriate
one
for
determining
the
effect
of
a
bank
merger.
if
for
example,
we
have
a
merger
of
a
bank
in
allentown
with
a
merger
of
the
bank
in
phillipsburg,
that
would
be
the
appropriate
market
but
we
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
determining
the
effect
of
this
merger,
these
two
banks
in
phillipsburg,
that
phillipsburg-easton
together
is
a
relevant
market
within
which
to
evaluate
the
effect.
in
its
philadelphia
bank
decision,
this
court
stated
that
in
determining
the
appropriate
geographical
market,
the
proper
question
is
not
whether
parties
to
the
merger
do
business
or
even
where
they
compete,
but
where
within
the
area
of
competitive
overlap
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
will
be
direct
and
immediate
and
i
will
now
proceed
to
show
that
this
merger
will
have
a
direct
and
immediate
effect
upon
competition
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
rule
that
out
mr.
justice
but
i
think
that
again
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
this
court
indicated
that
the
critical
inquiry
is
where
the
immediate
effect
will
be
felt
and
of
course
we're
dealing
here
with
potential
entry
to
competition.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
actual
injury.
all
the
statute
requires
where
the
effect
may
be
and
we
think
that
if
in
fact,
this
has
that
effect
in
a
relevant
market,
the
merger
cannot
be
saved
because
of
the
fact
that
the
banks
may
be
able
to
expand
into
the
peripheral
areas.
the
figures
we
have,
page
37
and
footnote
29
of
our
brief,
we
have
submitted
a
table
which
breaks
down
as
between
the
different
types
of
business,
the
sources
of
the
merging
banks
business.
the
deposit
and
loan
statistics
there
contained
showed
that
the
banks
do
roughly
85%
of
their
business
in
phillipsburg
and
easton
as
i
have
previously
indicated
in
answer
to
a
question
of
justice
stewart
that
there's
very
little
in
the
way
of
solicitation
outside
the
area
and
very
comparatively
little
done
outside
and
similarly
banks
outside
the
area
generally
do
only
solicit
in
the
area
on
rare
occasions.
indeed
the
business
is
even
more
localized
than
that.
it
seems
to
be
pretty
much
localized
within
phillipsburg
and
within
easton.
for
example,
each
of
the
merging
banks
did
only
10%
of
its
business
--
i'm
sorry,
got
only
10%
of
its
savings
and
time
deposits
from
easton.
statistics
indicate
that
almost
every
one
of
the
85,000
families
in
phillipsburg
deals
with
one
of
the
three
banks
in
that
area
and
numerous
businessmen
in
phillipsburg
testified
that
they
preferred
to
deal
with
a
local
bank
in
phillipsburg
than
to
go
across
the
river
to
easton.
it's
not
surprising
that
this
business
is
thus
localized
because
the
vast
bulk
of
the
customers
of
these
two
banks
are
small
people.
in
terms
of
the
number
of
deposits
of
these
banks
just
under
three
quarters
of
a
total
number
of
deposits
are
less
than
a
$1,000.00
and
96%
of
them
are
less
than
$10,000.00.
again,
in
terms
of
loans,
the
percentages
are
somewhat
smaller
but
nevertheless
quite
strong.
phillipsburg
national
had
roughly
three
quarters
of
its
loans
for
less
than
$2,500.00.
second
national
had
58%
and
when
you
get
to
loans
of
up
to
$10,000.00,
86
and
94%
are
less
than
$10,000.00.
now,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
these
figures
actually
reflected
the
realities
of
banking.
banking
is
essentially
local.
it's
locally
oriented
and
particularly
so
for
the
small
customers
and
convenience,
the
convenience
of
access
to
have
your
bank
near
you
is
the
important
thing.
the
merging
banks
indeed
themselves
recognized
this
because
as
the
suburban
communities
developed
four
or
five
miles
outside
the
center
of
phillipsburg,
they
open
branches
as
there
as
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
explained,
they
said
that's
where
the
customers
are.
and
furthermore,
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
pointed
out
in
response
to
a
question
that
a
great
many
of
the
loans
that
they
make
in
this
small
town
are
based
primarily
on
the
character
of
the
borrower
and
he
said
that
a
man
where
you
have
a
loan
made
on
a
character
basis,
the
people
in
phillipsburg
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
obtain
a
loan
in
any
area
outside
where
they
weren't
known.
now
the
--
the
banks
themselves
in
their
business
have
recognized
the
integrated,
localized
character
of
the
phillipsburg-easton
market.
phillipsburg
and
easton
are
in
different
federal
reserve
districts
which
means
that
normally,
their
checks
would
clear
from
different
federal
reserve
clearing
house
banks
and
this
would
obviously
cause
a
considerable
problem
so
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
established
something
they
call
the
easton-phillipsburg
clearing
house.
each
every
three
months
or
so,
one
of
the
banks
in
this
area
takes
it
turn
to
act
as
a
clearing
house
for
all
checks
drawn
on
banks
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
and
the
president
of
the
largest
bank
in
easton
in
discussing
this
arrangement
said
and
this
is
in
page
140
appendix,
he
said,
this
arrangement,
i
quote,
“seems
to
be
another
fact
which
indicates
a
closely-knit
community
even
though
separated
by
the
delaware
river.”
another
indication
of
the
integrated
nature
of
this
banking
community
is
the
fact
that
for
many
years,
banks
in
the
surrounding
area
outside
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
were
paying
4%
on
savings.
at
the
same
time,
the
easton
banks
were
paying
3%,
the
phillipsburg
banks
3.5%
but
in
1968,
when
one
of
the
banks
in
easton
increased
its
savings
rate
to
4%,
very
quickly,
all
the
rest
of
them
followed
suit.
now,
the
significance
of
all
of
these
facts
of
localization
comes
down
to
this
that
this
indicates
to
us
that
this
is
the
area
where
the
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
primarily
felt.
these
are
the
people,
the
people
who
deal
with
these
banks,
who
give
their
business
there
from
whom
the
banks
derived
a
vast
part
of
their
business.
these
are
the
people
to
whom
the
elimination
of
an
alternative
source
of
banking
will
be
hurt.
these
are
the
people
who
are
going
to
feel
it
and
this
is
in
effect
in
the
language
of
the
philadelphia
bank
case
is
where
the
merge
would
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact.
the
basic
error
of
the
district
court,
we
think,
was
its
refusal
to
recognize
the
significance
of
this
considerations
and
instead
its
reliance
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
business
and
worked
mobility
within
the
broader
area,
that
is
people
will
drive
15
or
20
miles
to
go
to
work,
people
will
drive
as
far
as
allentown
and
bethlehem
to
shop
but
this
case,
of
course,
is
dealing
with
the
effect
of
this
merger
on
banking
not
on
other
businesses
and
the
fact
that
a
man
is
willing
to
drive
20
or
25
miles
to
work,
to
buy
a
new
suit
of
clothes,
to
buy
a
new
sofa
doesn't
mean
he's
willing
to
drive
20
or
25
miles
to
bank.
indeed,
all
the
indication
in
this
record
is
to
the
contrast.
now,
i'll
just
briefly
like
to
refer
to
one
contention
that
the
appellees
make
here
in
their
brief
which
is
that
in
any
event,
whatever
else
you
may
think
about
our
market,
phillipsburg-easton
is
not
an
economically
significant
area
of
the
country.
i
take
it
the
argument
is
too
small
and
therefore
cannot
be
a
relevant
section
of
the
country
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
they
rely
primarily
on
the
fact
that
prior
to
1950,
the
clayton
act
spoke
of
an
effect,
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
in
any
community
or
section
and
that
in
the
1950
amendments
of
the
statute,
the
word
“community”
was
deleted
and
they
rely
on
a
colloquy
before
the
senate
hearing
at
which
congressman
celler,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
act,
engaged
in
a
long
discussion
with
senator
donald
and
they
picked
certain
language
which
they
suggest
indicates
that
really
congress
never
intended
to
permit
this
small
an
area
of
the
country
to
be
relevant
section
of
the
country.
now,
for
whatever
this
kind
of
legislative
history
is
worth,
the
testimony
given
before
a
senate
committee
by
a
member
of
the
house
who
was
one
of
the
principal
sponsors
of
the
bill.
we
don't
think
it
proves
what
the
defendants
believe
it
proves
because
at
the
end
of
this
long
colloquy,
what
comes
out
of
it
is
that
mr.
celler
said
he
believed
that
the
phrase,
“section
of
the
country”
means
any
trade
area.
that's
what
they
were
talking
about
that
one
of
the
statute
to
be
able
to
reach
a
trade
area
and
we
think
that
this
area,
phillipsburg-easton
certainly
is
a
significant
trade
area
in
terms
of
commercial
banking.
within
the
phillipsburg-easton
area,
we
think
that
under
this
court's
standards
that
it
has
applied
for
determining
competitive
effect
in
horizontal
mergers,
the
effect
of
this
merger
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
as
i
have
previously
indicated
the
market
in
this,
the
banking
in
this
area
is
concentrated,
we
have
filed
with
the
court,
this
xeroxed
document
which
is
a
substitute
for
a
chart
we
have
at
page
13
of
our
brief.
unfortunately,
in
preparing
the
chart
on
page
13,
we
derived
some
of
the
figures
from
the
wrong
exhibit.
the
figures
given
in
the
narrative
on
the
following
page
15
are
correct
but
we
have
just
reproduced
this
to
give
the
correct
figures.
the
market
--
the
three
largest
banks
in
the
area,
as
i've
indicated,
have
approximately
60%
of
the
total
assets,
70%
of
the
deposits,
65%
of
the
loans.
the
result
of
this
merger
would
be
to
make
the
new
bank,
the
phillips
--
combination
of
phillipsburg
national
and
the
second
national,
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
area,
it
would
have
approximately
--
it
will
have
19.3%
of
all
the
banking
assets
in
the
area
$41
million,
23.2%
of
the
deposits
$38
million
and
27%
of
the
loans
which
is
almost
$25
million.
the
share
--
total
share
of
assets
held
by
the
three
largest
banks
would
increase
as
a
result
of
this
merger
almost
12%
to
68%,
that
is
from
60%
to
68%.
the
deposits
would
increase
to
almost
80%.
and
after
this
merger,
the
three
largest
banks
would
control
three
quarters
of
all
the
banking
offices
in
the
area,
12
out
of
16.
now,
of
course,
that's
the
impact
of
this
merger
phillipsburg-easton.
the
impact
of
the
merger
in
phillipsburg
itself
would
be
much,
much
greater.
there,
what
we
would
have,
is
you'd
have
one
bank
with
75%
of
all
the
business,
three
times
larger
than
the
other
banks,
and
this
would
eliminate
for
the
people
in
phillipsburg
one
of
three
banking
alternatives
and
i
think
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
this
merger
in
the
phillipsburg
community
is
rather
dramatically
illustrated
by
the
fact
and
i
have
to
preface
this
by
saying
we
did
not
make
this
argument
in
the
district
court
by
the
fact
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
grinnell
case,
it
would
seem
that
a
combination
which
gives
the
combined
firm
75%
of
the
market
violates
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
because
you've
got
in
one
hands
three
quarters
of
the
markets.
certainly,
that
is
enough
to
control
prices
and
exclude
competitors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
we
are
because
we
think,
that
is
as
the
district
--
and
we
think
correctly,
the
district
court
treated
that
way
and
we
think
commercial
banking
is
the
appropriate
one.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
come
to
that
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment
in
my
discussion
of
the
convenience
and
needs
but
this
court
has
held
that
the
1966
bank
merger
act
did
not
change
the
standards
for
the
determining
competitive
impact.
it
introduced
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
justice
we'd
have
to
disagree.
this
--
same
argument,
this
same
argument
was
made
in
the
nashville
case
and
in
the
nashville
case,
the
court
stated
that
it
did
not
believe
that
in
the
bank
merger
act
the
congress
intended
any
change
in
the
traditional
standards
for
determining
competitive
effect.
these
are
considerations
that
may
perhaps
be
appropriately
taken
into
account
in
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
but
in
making
the
initial
determination
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
on
the
competitive
effect,
we
think
the
standard
is
the
same.
now,
i
have
one
other
fact
which
unfortunately
we
have
not
referred
to
in
our
brief
but
i
think
is
significant.
while
we
do
not
have
in
this
market
anything
like
the
history
of
mergers
that
we
had
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
and
some
of
the
other
cases,
we
do
know
and
the
record
does
show
that
the
largest
bank
in
easton
is
the
result
of
a
merger
in
1959
which
point
two
banks
with
assets
of
$25
million
each
who
joined
to
form
this
bank
which
in
that
time
since
then
has
grown
50%
to
its
present
size
of
74
million.
now,
i'd
like
--
i
may
then
identify
but
i
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
just
read,
the
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
but
the
--
we
think
the
facts
i've
demonstrated
bring
this
case
within
the
rule
announced
in
philadelphia
bank
where
the
court
said
that
a
merger
which
produces
a
firm
controlling
an
undue
percentage
share
of
the
relevant
market
and
results
in
a
significant
increase
in
the
concentration
of
firms
in
that
market
is
so
inherently
likely
to
lessen
competition
substantially
that
it
must
be
enjoined
in
the
absence
of
evidence
clearly
showing
that
the
merger
is
not
likely
to
have
such
anticompetitive
effects.
now,
if
we're
correct
in
our
conclusion
that
this
merger
is
bad
in
terms
of
its
anticompetitive
effects
under
these
standards,
then
it
seems
to
me,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
must
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
to
that
court,
because
the
court's
balancing
test
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
were
clearly
outweighed
by
the
community
convenience
and
need.
it
seems
to
us
is
vitiated
when
the
court
has
incorrectly
calculated
one
side
of
the
scales,
as
again
in
national
bank,
the
court
recognized,
it
said,
to
weigh
adequately
one
of
these
factors
against
the
other
requires
a
proper
conclusion
as
to
each
and
we
don't
think
the
court's
conclusion
if
the
very
end
of
its
opinion
where
the
court
said
at
page
699
of
the
appellant
that
even
if
there
were
de
minimis
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
narrowly
drawn
market
proposed
by
the
government,
such
effect
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
deserved
by
the
merged
bank
constitutes
an
adequate
evaluation
of
this
factor.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
careful
balancing
that
congress
intended
before
an
anticompetitive
merger
could
be
approved.
and
therefore,
we
think
the
case
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
as
in
national
bank
properly
to
perform
the
balancing
function
but
since
the
district
court
undertook
to
determine
convenience
in
need
and
since
on
a
remand,
the
issue
would
again
arise,
we
have
fully
discussed
this
issue
and
we
think
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
it
but
we
think
the
district
court
committed
two
basic
errors
in
applying
the
convenience
and
needs
standard.
first,
we
think
it
used
the
wrong
market
area,
and
secondly,
it
misapplied
the
convenience
and
need
standard
in
several
particulars.
the
particular
provision,
the
convenience
and
need
provision,
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
61
and
the
top
of
62
of
our
brief
and
what
it
says
in
effect
is
that
where
a
merger
has
the
effect
of
--
may
effect
--
may
substantially
lessen
competition,
it
cannot
be
improved
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed,
clearly
outweighed
and
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case?
no
in
this
case
because
under
the
bank
merger
act,
mr.
justice,
the
filing
of
a
suit
by
the
government
within
30
days
operates
as
a
stay
and
then
the
district
court
further
extended
the
stay
pending
the
determination
of
this
appeal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
suit
was
filed
in
january
1968,
a
little
over
two
years.
the
--
the
basic
purpose
of
course
of
this
convenience
and
needs
defense
is
to
permit
bank
mergers
to
go
ahead,
go
forward,
which
even
though
they
are
anticompetitive,
produce
such
significant
benefits
to
the
community
that
on
balance
it
appears
that
the
public
interest
will
be
best
served
by
sanctioning
such
an
anticompetitive
merger.
but
it
seems
for
us
for
this
comparison
to
be
a
meaningful
one,
the
community
benefits
resulting
from
the
merger
have
to
be
assessed
in
the
same
area
as
the
community
detriments
also
resulting
from
the
merger
because
in
both
instances
which
we're
considering
are
the
banking
needs
of
the
community.
in
the
one
hand,
you
look
to
the
banking
needs
to
determine
what
the
area
is
where
the
merge
will
have
its
effect
and
then
you
look
and
turn
around
on
the
other
side
and
say
what
effect,
favorable
effect
on
the
same
banking
needs
will
the
merger
have.
now,
to
be
sure,
they
may
be
situations
in
which
a
merger
will
have
an
effect,
a
beneficial
effect
upon
a
segment
of
the
community
and
that
beneficial
effect
on
the
segment
of
the
community,
we're
down
to
that
benefit
of
the
entire
community.
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
while
that
is
permissible,
you
cannot
properly
evaluate
and
sustain
a
community
needs
defense
on
the
basis
of
benefits
to
a
narrow
segment
of
the
community
that
do
not
benefit
the
entire
community
which
is
the
relevant
area
for
testing
the
impact
of
the
merger
upon
competition
and
that
we
think
is
just
precisely
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case
in
terms
what
we
think
is
the
relevant
market,
the
phillipsburg-easton
market.
the
court
as
i
have
indicated
relied
upon
two
factors
primarily
as
in
a
ground
for
sanctioning
this
merger.
first,
the
higher
lending
limits
that
the
larger
bank
would
have.
the
bank's
lending
limits
turned
upon
its
capital
surplus,
sometimes
retained
profits,
and
so
on
and
of
course,
every
time
you
combine
two
banks,
you
get
a
larger
lending
limit.
each
of
these
banks
had
a
lending
limit
of
approximately
$100,000.00
when
you
combine
them
with
various
accounting
adjustments.
the
new
bank
would
have
a
lending
limit
of
$250,000.00
and
there
was
testimony
that
people
in
--
some
of
the
businessmen
in
--
a
number
of
businessmen
in
the
phillipsburg
area
would
like
a
bank
in
phillipsburg
with
a
larger
lending
limit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
relatively,
there's
no
statistical
evidence
on
that.
there
are
indications
that
some
of
them
have
had
to
go
outside.
in
some
instances,
the
loans
were
satisfied
through
participations.
there
some
of
them
who
testified,
they
didn't
particularly
care
to
go
outside
that
they
prefer
to
deal
with
the
phillipsburg
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area,
mr.
justice.
this
is
the
point
i
was
coming
through
in
easton,
there
are
four
banks
whose
lending
limit
is
either
equal
to
or
substantially
in
excess
of
the
$250,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
need
but
there's
no
indication
that
it's
not
that
the
need
for
the
big
loans
as
not
being
adequately
met
in
this
area.
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
first
of
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
automatically
be
an
answer,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
say
the
need,
the
community
need
for
an
additional
bank
for
these
loans,
if
that's
under
that
hypothesis,
i
think
would
be
a
relatively
minor
factor
in
assessing
community
convenience.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
would
be
a
factor
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
relatively
minor
factor
and
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance,
these
loans
that
we're
talking
about
are
small
--
involved
a
small
number
of
people.
that
the
record
shows
that
during
the
average
year,
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
had
a
request
for
25
loans
in
excess
of
its
lending
limit
as
against
some
5000
loans
it
had.
the
second
national
bank,
i
think,
average
something
like
17
loans
--
had
17
requests
a
year
out
of
some
2200
loans
that
it
had,
so
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
that
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
it
shows
that.
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
exhibits
showing
as
to
each
bank
series
of
exhibits
beginning
at
pages
725
which
shows
the
percentage
of
loans
coming
from
all
of
the
different
types
of
customers
and
the
number
of
loans
that's
broken
down
into
size.
for
example,
we
have
a
group
of
loans
of
more
than
$50,000.00
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
the
percentages
could
be
calculated.
the
number
of
these
loans
for
example
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
you
can
assess
it,
mr.
justice
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
record
shows
that
the
number
of
people
seeking
these
large
loans
is
comparatively
small
and
i
think
you
have
to
compare
that,
you
have
to
compare
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
their
needs
are
being
satisfied.
if
they're
seeking
in
getting
them
in
another
bank
from
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i'm
not
suggesting
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
frivolous
mr.
justice
but
i
do
think
that
we
do
know
that
there
are
four
large
banks
in
easton,
so
in
the
broader
phillipsburg-easton
area,
there
is
no
lack
of
competition.
these
are
four
large
banks,
each
one
of
whom
could
provide
a
loan
limit
either
equal
to
that
of
the
merged
banks
or
substantially
greater.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
four
banks
in
easton
whose
lending
limits
ranged
from
$224,000.00
to
$587,000.00
i
believe.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
$587,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
easton.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
three
and
one
can
lend
$224,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
none.
the
three
banks,
their
maximum
limit
is
approximately,
roughly,
a
$100,000.00
in
phillipsburg.
and
mr.
justice,
let
me
come
to
say
one
other
thing
in
this
connection
which
is
that
there
may
be
other
ways
of
course
of
increasing
lending
limits
beside
combining
the
two
banks
into
a
bank.
we've
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
banks
that
sell
stocks.
some
of
the
banks
in
this
area
have
to
sell
stock.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
considering
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
lending
limit
is
arguably
a
stronger
one
but
even
then,
i'm
not
sure
that
basically,
that
convenience
and
need
goes
so
far
as
to
permit
the
elimination
of
competition.
i
think
it
depends
upon,
you
have
to
balance
on
the
one
hand
what
the
effect
is
on
competition,
on
the
other
hand
balance
what
the
benefits
to
community
are
and
in
concerning
benefits
to
the
community,
i
think
it's
appropriate
and
it's
necessary
to
consider
other
ways
by
which
the
banks
could
help
solve
these
problems
and
notice
that
there
was
no
other
way
in
which
they
could
increase
their
lending
limits
except
through
a
merger
and
if
it
further
appear
that
there
are
businessman
in
phillipsburg-easton
area
that
were
suffering
because
they
couldn't
get
the
money,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
significant
factor.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
turns
out
and
i
might
mention
that
some
of
the
businessmen
here
in
this
record,
for
example,
we
had
a
witness
who
was
an
official
of
a
gas
company
who
was
saying
that
he
wanted
--
he
like
the
larger
lending
limit
in
the
phillipsburg
area,
then
he
admitted
however
that
since
his
lending
demand
for
about
$2
million,
there's
no
bank
in
the
area
that
could
satisfy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
why
because
in
the
phillipsburg
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
is
in
iowa,
we
think
in
phillipsburg-easton,
if
on
the
other
hand,
you're
doing
in
phillipsburg
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
the
other
side
of
the
equation
in
phillipsburg
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
merger
are
very
drastic.
there
you
have
a
very
drastic
effect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
phillipsburg
itself
is
18,000,
the
broader
area,
the
surrounding
area
is
28,000.
easton
has
a
population
of
32,000
and
the
surrounding
area
60,000.
so
phillipsburg
and
easton
together
is
just
under
100,000.
mr.

roughly
half
a
mile.
they're
on
opposite
sides
of
the
delaware
river.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
two
bridges.
one
free
bridge
and
one
bridge
where
you
buy
tickets
at
a
cost
of
$2.50
per
ride
and
there's
extensive
traffic
back
and
forth.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
court's
evaluation
of
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
was
defective
in
another
respect
that
it
doesn't
appear
that
either
the
banks
or
the
court
adequately
explored
the
possibility
of
ultimate
methods
of
achieving
this
same
benefits.
for
example,
at
the
time
of
this
merger,
new
jersey
law
permitted
banks
to
merge
within
their
own
county.
and
in
warren
county
where
phillipsburg
is
located,
there
were
at
that
time
six
other
banks
which
would
have
been
available
to
these
banks
as
merger.
in
the
city
of
washington,
about
12
miles
away,
there
were
two
banks
of
roughly
comparable
size.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it's
washington,
new
jersey
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
small
town
in
new
jersey.
two
banks
approximately
12,
13
miles
away,
both
of
the
same
size,
roughly
as
this
merging
banks
yet
the
indication
is,
the
record
shows
that
directors
never
considered
the
possibility
of
merging
with
those
other
banks.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
one
bank
in
flemington,
new
jersey
where
the
president
testified
that
over
the
years,
this
bank
had
followed
a
policy
of
not
paying
out
cash
dividends.
he
said
we
plowed
back
our
dividends
in
order
to
meet
the
growing
requirements
of
our
community
and
despite
this
lack
of
payment
of
cash
dividends,
they
recently
made
a
substantial
stock
offering
that
was
50%
over
what
was
described
and
in
addition,
the
third
bank
in
phillipsburg,
the
phillipsburg
trust
company
for
many
years
had
filed
a
practice
of
paying
only
stock
dividends
and
not
cash
dividends
in
order
to
build
up
its
capital
structure.
i
think
this
should
be
contrasted
with
the
statement
of
mr.
vargo,
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
when
he
said
that
the
bank
at
the
present
time
couldn't
hire
three
specialists
that
they
would
like
to
have.
he
said,
it
will
be
expensive
and
it
would
be
a
burden
in
our
profits
and
the
dividends
for
our
shareholders.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
phillipsburg
is
right
after
new
jersey
line.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
river.
the
river
separates
the
two
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
type
of
case?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
type
of
the
public
interest
in
this
type
of
a
case
mr.
justice,
i
think
is
preserving
for
the
large
number
of
small
bank
customers
in
the
small
areas
the
opportunity
to
preserve
the
availability
of
competing
sources
of
bank
business.
that
is
to
make
sure
that
these
people
have
the
maximum
choice.
and
of
course
banking
by
its
very
nature
in
these
small
towns
does
tend
to
be
somewhat
concentrated
and
you
have
the
problem
in
the
bank
situation.
it's
very
difficult
to
get
in
and
you
can't
just
open
a
bank
the
way
you
open
a
store.
you
have
to
get
the
approval
of
the
various
regulatory
authorities
and
once
a
bank
is
merged
out,
once
it
disappears,
that's
likely
to
be
the
end
of
it
and
the
result
is
that
if
this
merger
goes
ahead,
the
competitive
opportunities
for
the
small
people
in
this
market,
we
think,
will
be
significantly
diminished
and
that's
why
we
brought
this
case
here
and
that's
why
we're
urging
this
court
to
reverse
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
technically,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
since
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
and
that
is
the
practice
in
this
court
one
has
followed
where
it
said
since
the
cases
had
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
you'd
have
to
--
the
court
would
have
to
agree
with
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
that
the
district
court
apparently
was
going
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
product
market,
that
is
that
if
the
court
did
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
we
think
commercial
banking
was
a
relevant
market
and
we
think
that
was
correct
the
reasons
we
have
given
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
you
thought
of
course
the
other
side
hasn't
appeal
from
that
ruling
and
if
you
thought
commercial
banking
was
not
the
relevant
market,
i
suppose,
it
would
be
then
appropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
develop
some
more
evidence
as
to
what
was
the
appropriate
market
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
--
well,
again
it
would
follow
in
his
market
but
not
necessarily
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
market
because
even
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
market,
while
this
might
result
in
diminishing
some
of
the
percentages,
they
still
might
be
enough
to
prove
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
minute,
there
are
two
points
i
would
like
to
make.
one
is
a
legal
argument
and
the
other
is
to
give
some
statistics
that
the
department
has
worked
out
as
to
the
comptroller's
record
in
approving
the
merger.
the
legal
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
just
this.
the
problems
faced
by
these
two
banks
are
basically
the
same
problems
faced
by
most
banks
in
the
smaller
communities.
the
difficulty
is
they
don't
have
a
large
enough
lending
limit.
they
have
difficulty
hiring
people,
now
they'd
like
to
expand
and
we
don't
think
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
way
to
solve
these
problems
is
by
combining
two
successful
banks
that
are
directly
competing
with
each
other.
there
are
other
ways
available
to
these
banks.
the
one
thing
they
can
increase
their
capitalization.
the
record
shows
that
in
nine
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
get
bought
by
a
bigger
bank,
mr.
justice,
you're
not
eliminating
competition
between
them
even
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
department
would
mr.
justice
if
it's
just
a
small
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
but
it
seems
to
me,
they
are
very
different
situation
because
even
if
a
new
york
--
it
have
to
be
a
new
york
banks
that
sits
in
new
jersey
but
if
the
two
--
but
if
the
new
york
bank
purchased
one
of
these
banks,
you
still
have
three
competing
banks
in
the
area.
under
this
merger,
you
have
only
two
competing
banks
in
the
phillipsburg
area.
the
purchase
of
one
of
these
banks,
by
a
bank,
a
big
bank
from
outside
the
area
does
not
eliminate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
reduce
the
number
in
this
community
by
this
merger
from
seven
to
six.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
in
the
phillipsburg
area
you
reduce
it
from
three
to
two
and
that
is
it
seems
to
us
is
a
very
different
situation
in
continuing
the
number
of
banks
at
seven
but
allowing
one
of
the
banks
to
be
operated,
owned
by
a
bank
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
cut
down
to
six
but
we
think
with
an
already
concentrated
market
and
with
the
fact
that
while
you
have
one
community
of
seven,
the
indication
is
that
the
major
focus
of
banking
is
in
each
community,
we
think
that
the
elimination
of
this
number
and
it
significantly
increasing
concentration,
isn't
it.
now
if
i
might
mr.
chief
justice
because
of
the
questions
raised,
could
i
permissibly
just
indicate
some
of
the
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
summary
of
the
statistics
we
have
is
when
we
will
submit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
will
submit
a
letter
and
we'll
have
to
check
the
statistics
but
the
preliminary
information
we
have
is
that
in
the
years
1967
and
1968,
in
each
of
those
years,
the
comptroller
approved
approximately
88
mergers.
these
are
all
statistics
and
we
think
that
the
figures
roughly
approximate.
in
1967,
he
disapproved
one
and
approved
88.
in
1968
he
disapproved
any
and
in
1969,
we
have
figures
roughly
more
than
100
as
far
as
we
can
show
they
are
no
denials.
this
is
our
rough
figures
which
we
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
these
are
ones
that
were
presented
to
the
comptroller
when
we
have
it.
i
don't
know
if
there
was
a
hearing
in
all
cases.
i
was
trying
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
formal
application
and
these
do
not
cover
mergers
where
the
application
was
withdrawn
after.
well,
these
are
just
application
in
which
he
acted
and
we
will
supplement
this
and
try
to
obtain
as
accurate
figures
as
we
can.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
jersey
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
there
which
after
trial
dismissed
a
government
civil
antitrust
suit
challenging
the
merger
of
two
banks
in
the
town
of
phillipsburg,
new
jersey
as
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
appeal
presents
a
number
of
important
questions
as
to
the
standards
to
be
applied
by
the
courts
in
passing
upon
the
application
of
section
7
to
small
bank
mergers
and
also
as
to
the
correctness
of
certain
rulings
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
in
upholding
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
that
congress
wrote
into
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
as
a
permissible
basis
of
justifying
anticompetitive
mergers.
before
discussing
the
facts
in
these
legal
issues
however,
i
just
briefly
like
to
explain
to
the
court
why
the
government
considers
this
an
important
case
and
why
the
government
has
brought
to
this
case
a
factual
situation
and
on
its
face
does
not
seem
to
be
of
the
greatest
economic
significance.
ten
and
15
years
ago,
we
had
in
this
country
a
great
wave
of
tremendous
bank
mergers.
multibillion
dollar
institutions
combine,
institutions
involving
hundreds
of
million
dollars
combined
in
the
large
metropolitan
areas,
new
york
city,
philadelphia,
chicago,
houston
and
so
on.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
1963
in
the
philadelphia
bank
merger
case
and
a
series
of
other
decisions
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
the
focus
of
the
whole
trend
of
bank
mergers
has
shifted.
today,
we
no
longer
have
this
pattern
of
large
bank
mergers
in
the
big
city.
those
seemed
to
be
a
thing
of
the
past
because
under
this
court's
decisions,
these
combinations
and
these
very
large
highly
concentrated
markets
are
illegal.
what
we
have
instead
is
a
developing
trend
of
mergers
along
the
smaller
banks
in
the
smaller
areas
and
in
the
past
four
or
five
years,
virtually
all
of
the
justice
departments,
bank
merger
suits
have
been
brought
against
this
type
of
merger.
the
reason
we
have
brought
these
cases
is
we
think
that
since
in
the
smaller
marketing
areas,
the
very
nature
of
banking
tends
to
make
it
a
concentrated
market,
a
relatively
small
number
of
banks
and
since
in
the
smaller
communities,
as
i
shall
develop
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
the
people
particularly
affected
the
small
borrowers.
most
of
the
small
banks
tend
to
be
primarily
concerned
with
small
customer.
we
think
it's
particularly
important
in
these
smaller
markets
to
preserve
for
banking
customers
the
available
alternatives
of
choice
that
is
to
make
sure
that
in
these
markets,
they
already
tend
to
be
concentrated.
they
do
not
take
place
a
large
number
of
bank
mergers
which
further
reduce
the
available
alternatives
and
that's
why
we
think
this
particular
type
of
situation.
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
come
before
this
court
involving
so-called
small
bank
mergers
and
that's
why
we
have
brought
the
case
and
we
think
it's
an
important
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
in
the
district
courts,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
these
cases,
we
have
lost
i
have
to
admit
it,
unfortunately,
several
of
these
cases
in
the
district
courts,
if
we
happen
to
appealed
because
these
cases
under
the
expediting
act,
all
of
these
bank
merger
cases
come
directly
from
the
district
court
to
this
court.
there
have
been
other
case,
bank
merger
cases,
involving
other
issues
in
the
courts
of
appeals
but
there
have
been
no
--
none
of
the
government
suits
challenging
bank
mergers
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
there
have
been
any
in
which
have
actually
gone
into
trial.
i
think
there
are
some
that
have
been
appending
and
i
think
there
have
been
a
couple
in
which
we
brought
a
suit
in
the
merger
terminated
at
that
point.
now,
let
me
with
this
background
come
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
phillipsburg,
new
jersey
is
an
industrial
community
with
a
population
of
about
18,000
including
the
surrounding
suburban
area
of
the
town
that
has
28,000.
it
is
directly
across
the
delaware
river
from
the
city
of
easton,
pennsylvania,
a
larger
city
with
a
population
of
32,000
and
in
the
environs
approximately
60,000.
the
two
cities
are
very
close
together.
they
are
connected
by
two
bridges,
one
of
which
is
free
and
other
of
which
has
a
charge
for
commuters
of
$2.50
crossing.
there
is
a
very
close
business
and
commercial
relationship
between
the
two
towns.
people
go
back
and
forth
from
the
two
towns
to
shop.
people
go
back
and
forth
to
work
and
as
a
businessman
in
phillipsburg
described
it,
he
said
that
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
is
in
effect
really
is
one
town.
like
so
many
of
the
cities
these
days,
the
central
areas
of
both
of
these
communities
have
not
had
much
growth.
it
has
become
rather
stagnant
in
recent
years.
its
population
has
remained
quite
stable.
on
the
other
hand,
the
surrounding
areas
have
grown
both
in
terms
of
population
and
industry.
the
town
of
phillipsburg
has
three
banks.
the
town
of
easton
has
four
banks,
one
of
which
is
a
branch
of
a
bank
in
the
easton
suburbs.
it
is
where
the
main
office
is
located,
a
few
miles
away
in
the
city,
town
of
nazareth,
pennsylvania.
the
acquiring
bank
in
this
case,
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
is
the
largest
in
phillipsburg
and
the
third
largest
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
in
1967
and
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
latest
date
for
which
data
are
in
the
record,
the
assets
were
approximately
$24
million.
it
has
its
main
office
in
the
downtown
part
of
town.
it
has
two
branches
in
the
suburban
areas
that
had
opened
in
1964.
the
acquired
bank,
the
second
national
bank
of
phillipsburg
is
the
second
largest
in
that
town
and
the
fifth
largest
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
it
has
assets
of
$17
million,
a
little
less
than
that
of
phillipsburg
national.
its
main
office
in
phillipsburg
is
directly
across
the
street
from
that
of
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
and
it
has
one
branch
in
the
suburbs
again
across
the
highway
from
one
of
the
branches
of
phillipsburg
national
and
it
says
apparent
from
the
facts
that
these
two
banks
are
direct
competitors.
both
of
these
banks
in
recent
years
have
undergone
substantial
growth
and
both
of
them
profitable.
in
the
10-year
period
from
1957
to
1967,
phillipsburg
national
doubled
its
assets
and
deposits
and
tripled
its
loans.
in
the
same
period,
1957
and
1967,
second
national
increased
its
assets
82%,
its
deposits
86%,
and
again
tripled
its
loans.
for
the
years
1962
to
1967,
except
for
one
year
in
which
phillipsburg
national
showed
a
deficit
because
of
various
accounting
changes
that
are
employed,
each
year
it
had
substantial
profits.
as
to
taxes,
they
ranged
from
$46,000.00
to
$123,000.00
and
over
that
same
five-year
period
phillipsburg
national
paid
total
dividends
of
$192,000.00.
similarly,
the
second
national
bank
in
this
five-year
period
every
year
has
substantial
earnings
ranging
from
$35,000.00
to
$73,000.00
and
it
paid
total
dividends
in
that
period
of
$198,000.00.
now,
both
of
these
banks
provide
a
full
range
of
the
traditional
and
usual
banking
services.
they
accept
demand
deposits,
savings
and
time
deposits;
they
provided
checking
service;
they
make
various
types
of
the
usual
loans,
commercial
and
industrial
loans,
mortgage
loans,
installment
loans,
consumer
loans;
they
have
safe
deposit
boxes,
etcetera.
unlike
the
large
city
bank,
however,
these
banks
is
apparently
as
typical
of
most
banks
in
the
smaller
communities,
have
a
much
heavier
percentage
of
their
deposits
in
time
and
savings
deposits
and
a
much
lower
percentage
of
their
deposits
than
the
demand
deposits
because
of
the
fact
that
this
community
just
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
heavy
industry
that
we
have
in
the
large
cities
and
similarly,
in
terms
of
their
loans,
a
much
greater
percentage
of
their
loans
were
in
real
estate
loans
in
the
big
city
banks
and
a
much
smaller
percentage
in
commercial
and
industrial
loans.
the
banking
market
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
areas
are
concentrated
one.
the
two
top
banks,
both
in
easton
have
approximately
50%
of
the
assets,
almost
50%
of
the
loans
and
55%
of
deposits
and
when
we
take
the
three
leading
banks
which
include
the
phillipsburg
national
bank,
it
comes
to
roughly
60%
of
assets,
65%
of
deposits
and
65%
of
loans.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
there
is
a
substantial
extent
of
social
and
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
towns
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
good
bid
of
movement
back
and
forth
between
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
and
the
surrounding
areas
of
the
country.
this
was
originally
a
rural
farming
country
and
as
there's
been
increasing
population
growth
and
industry,
a
large
number
of
smaller
towns
have
developed
and
in
fact
the
evidence
shows
that
people
who
live
in
phillipsburg-easton
frequently
go
outside
of
the
area
to
work,
that
people
who
live
in
the
outside
area
come
to
phillipsburg,
and
that
people
from
phillipsburg-easton
go
as
far
as
allentown
and
bethlehem,
pennsylvania
20
or
30
miles
to
shopping,
but,
and
we
think
this
is
critical
and
i
will
develop
it
in
more
detail
in
a
little
later.
the
record
shows
that
the
two
merging
banks
do
the
vast
bulk
of
their
business
of
all
types
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
now,
with
this
as
the
background,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
showed
--
there
are
various
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
particular
banks,
the
testimony
generally
as
in
most
instances,
they
get
a
very
small
part
of
their
business.
they
get
some
but
in
terms
of
percentages
for
example,
the
record
showing
that
some
banks
get
only
a
handful,
though
some
one
bank
had
testified
they
just
had
a
three
or
four
loans
in
phillipsburg.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
few
of
those,
not
many.
i
think
for
example
in
the
trust
business,
they
get
more
of
those,
but
basically,
i
think
the
bankers
themselves
testified
that
--
the
phillipsburg
bankers
testified
that
the
vast
bulk
of
the
business
of
the
merging
bank
comes
from
this
area
and
we
also
had
testimony
of
a
number
of
bankers
from
the
outside
area
who
generally
indicated
that
the
bulk
of
their
business
came
from
their
area.
they
all
said,
“yes,
we
have
a
few
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
their
immediate
location.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
tend
to
--
the
banks
in
this
area
tend
to
pretty
much
stick
to
their
own
little
preserve
four,
five-mile
radius
or
something
like
that.
that's
what
the
evidence
seems
to
show
in
this
case.
they
don't
seem
actively
to
go
out
into
the
areas
10
to
15
miles
away.
they
do
some
soliciting.
they
have
some
newspaper
as
to
by
enlarged,
they
stick
to
their
own
areas.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
trust
departments,
the
two
merging
banks
have
with
all
kind
or
rather
inadequate
trust
departments.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
the
bank
in
easton,
there's
a
bank
in
easton
that
has
one
of
a
very
fine
trust
department,
and
in
addition,
of
course
bank
--
and
there's
another
bank
that
does
business
in
easton
that
has
a
large
trust
department.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
in
allen
--
well,
there's
another
bank,
i
think
one
of
the
banks
that
is
outside
of
easton,
not
in
allentown
and
bethlehem
that
does
trust
business
and
has
a
branch
in
easton
and
then
of
course
the
banks
in
allentown
and
bethlehem
which
are
much
larger
than
any
of
these
banks
have
extensive
trust
business.
and
they
do
get,
there
is
evidence
that
these
outside
banks
do
get
trust
business,
of
course,
and
this
tend
to
be
by
enlarge
the
larger
accounts,
of
course
the
trust
business.
now,
the
district
court
in
this
case
basically
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
made
about
three
or
four
rulings
that
are
significant
here.
the
court
in
this
case
said
that
because
a
large
number
of
other
financial
types
of
institutions
are
competing
in
the
area
with
the
banks
that
the
relevant
market
for
testing
competitive
effect
in
this
case
was
not
commercial
banking
as
such.
he
pointed
--
the
district
judge
pointed
to
the
fact
the
two
had
saving
and
loans
association,
the
two
had
finance
companies,
the
two
had
mutual
funds
that
were
seeking
to
obtain
the
savings
deposits
of
the
customers,
the
two
had
finance
organization
seeking
loans
and
the
court,
therefore,
has
concluded
that
the
appropriate
line
of
commerce
for
the
testing
the
effect
of
this
merger
was
those
particular
services
rendered
by
the
bank
as
to
which
really
there
was
no
significant
competition.
and
the
services
the
court
included
in
its
line
of
commerce
with
checking
accounts,
savings
accounts,
certificates
of
deposits,
personal
loans,
consumer
and
installment
loans
and
commercial
and
industrial
loans.
but
then
rather
inconsistent
with
this
theory
when
the
court
came
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
by
examining
the
concentration
ratios
and
the
increases
in
concentration,
the
court
looked
to
the
figures
dealing
with
commercial
banking,
not
with
the
subcategories
of
commercial
banking
which
court
believed
was
the
relevant
market.
so
what
it
amounts
to,
it
seems
to
us,
it's
really
kind
of
a
dictum,
the
court
said
it
didn't
think
that
commercial
banking
was
the
relevant
market
then
it
turned
around
and
in
fact
tested
this
by
commercial
banking.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
didn't
say
it
explicitly
but
the
court
in
its
opinion
discussed
all
the
figures
relating
to
commercial
banking
as
a
line
of
commerce.
now,
on
the
geographic
market,
we
have
distributed
to
the
court
this
little,
three-colored
map.
mr.
meyner
in
behalf
of
the
banks
has
objected
to
the
distribution
of
this
map
on
the
ground
that
this
map
was
offered
in
evidence
at
the
trial
court
and
was
objected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that's
--
well,
he
only
claims
that
it
was
rejected
because
he
claims
it
distorts
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
did
not
--
we
did
not
intend
to
indicate
that
mr.
justice.
this
was
just
attempting
to
show
the
geographical
area.
there's
a
patchwork
of
roads
or
extensive
highways.
there's
whole
lot
of
little
towns.
what
we
--
the
reason
we
submitted
this
is
because
as
the
district
court
defined
the
market,
the
district
court
listed
about
30
or
40
communities
and
said
i
find
that
this
is
the
market
and
when
you
just
list
communities,
unless
one
is
familiar
with
this
particular
section
of
the
country,
it's
difficult
to
see
precisely
what
is
involved
and
we
do
not
claim
that
this
is
exactly
accurate.
it's
just
a
rough
approximation,
but
i
think
with
the
colors,
it
will
indicate
basically
what
is
the
area
of
dispute
here.
the
government
have
proposed
in
the
district
court
that
the
relevant
market
could
be
one
of
two
areas.
either
the
phillipsburg
area
itself
which
is
in
that
part
we
have
colored
pink,
or
the
combination
of
phillipsburg
and
easton
which
is
colored
blue.
the
defendants
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
suggested
a
much
broader
market.
the
district
court
selected
a
market
somewhere
in
between
which
is
the
part
colored
green
which
appears
to
be
roughly
four
times
the
size
of
armored
market
and
is
also
is
shown
by
this
map.
the
district
court
included
in
its
relevant
market
the
city
of
bethlehem
over
to
the
extreme
left
and
drew
the
line
right
between
bethlehem
and
allentown
even
though
allentown
is
contiguous
to
bethlehem
and
in
effect
is
almost
a
continuation
of
it.
now,
within
this
market,
the
court
concluded
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
comptroller
was
a
market
which
was
basically
most
of
the
lehigh
valley,
and
most
of
this
large
section
here,
where
it
kind
goes
takes
part
--
it's
again
i
would
say
another
oblong
thing
around
this
market
and
it
was
included
part
of
bucks
county,
part
of
huntingdon
county,
larger
than
we
had
proposed.
and
they
also
suggested
the
--
perhaps
the
entire
lehigh,
--
allentown,
bethlehem,
easton,
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
is
an
even
larger
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
reading,
i
believe,
is
north
of
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
west
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice.
now,
within
this
broader
area
that
the
court
selected,
it
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
lesson
of
competition.
there
was
no
trend
toward
present
or
future
concentration.
the
merging
banks
had
only
six
and
three
quarter
percent
of
all
banking
assets
and
after
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
then
said
that
that
far
as
it
was
concerned
really
was
the
end
of
the
case,
but
since
the
convenience
and
needs
pointed
have
been
so
fully
canvassed,
it
would
also
rule
on
that,
and
it
then
held
that
the
banks
had
sustained
the
burden
of
proving
this
merger
was
justified
by
community
convenience
and
need
relying
primarily
on
two
factors
that
the
merger
would
result
in
the
lend
--
the
new
bank
having
a
much
larger
lending
limit
than
the
old
bank
and
that
it
would
permit
the
bank
for
the
first
time
to
employ
a
full
time
trust
officer
which
would
enable
it
to
build
up
a
trust
department
for
which
it
found
there
was
need
in
the
area.
and
in
deciding
the
convenience
and
need
point,
rather
interestingly
and
we
think
erroneously,
although
the
court
had
used
the
broad
geographical
market
for
determining
competitive
impact,
it
evaluated
the
needs
of
the
community
solely
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
phillipsburg,
not
phillipsburg-easton
but
just
phillipsburg.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
out
to
the
legal
issues
in
the
case.
the
first
one
is
the
so-called
product
market
by
the
commercial
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
--
as
it's
required
under
the
bank
holding
company
act,
the
matter
was
submitted
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
justice
department,
all
of
whom
advised
the
comptroller
in
their
view
the
merger
would
have
adverse
effects
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
merger
would
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
competition
and
indeed
the
two
banking
agencies
in
their
recommendation
viewed
phillipsburg
primarily
as
the
relevant
market.
the
comptroller
held
a
hearing
and
after
the
hearing
ruled
that
the
merger
did
not
have
the
anticompetitive
effects
primarily
again
because
the
comptroller
viewed
the
market
much
more
broadly
than
the
banking
agencies
have.
now,
there's
a
--
the
appellees
argue
at
considerable
length
as
to
why
commercial
banking
in
this
market
is
not
the
appropriate
product
and
that
the
district
court
therefore
correctly
rejected
that
line
of
commerce.
at
page
61
of
their
brief,
however,
the
bank's
record
that
the
government
in
any
event
hasn't
been
prejudiced
by
any
possible
error
in
this
thing
and
they
admitted
the
issue
is
no
longer
really
in
the
case
because
of
the
fact
that
in
deciding
the
effect
on
competition,
the
district
court
did
look
to
commercial
banking.
we
have
briefly
discussed
in
our
brief
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
in
this
case
as
in
all
the
banking
cases
before
this
court,
commercial
banking
is
an
appropriate
product
market
within
which
to
test
the
thing.
but
in
view
of
the
fact,
as
i
said
that
issue
no
longer
really
seems
to
be
a
real
life
or
in
the
case,
i
think
i
will
leave
the
discussion
to
our
brief
on
this
point.
now,
coming
to
the
first
of
the
critical
issues
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
because
we
have
to
win
on
this
case
to
seek,
i
would
get
a
reversal
here,
and
i
might
just
add
in
passing
that
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
reverse
and
remand
to
the
district
court
to
reconsider
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
under
what
we
think
is
the
proper
determination
that
the
merger
had
an
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
relevant
market.
the
--
this
court
in
the
pabst
case
recognized
that
just
as
with
products
so
in
the
case
of
geographic
areas
there
may
be
more
than
one
geographic
area
that
is
relevant.
in
pabst,
the
court
recognized
that
there
were
three
different
markets,
three
large
markets.
the
district
court
said
here
however
that
said
that
it
concluded
that
the
relevant
market,
that
was
the
word
used,
“the
relevant
market”
was
this
area
that
it
had
selected.
now,
there
may
be
situations
in
which
this
larger
market
is
an
appropriate
one
for
determining
the
effect
of
a
bank
merger.
if
for
example,
we
have
a
merger
of
a
bank
in
allentown
with
a
merger
of
the
bank
in
phillipsburg,
that
would
be
the
appropriate
market
but
we
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
determining
the
effect
of
this
merger,
these
two
banks
in
phillipsburg,
that
phillipsburg-easton
together
is
a
relevant
market
within
which
to
evaluate
the
effect.
in
its
philadelphia
bank
decision,
this
court
stated
that
in
determining
the
appropriate
geographical
market,
the
proper
question
is
not
whether
parties
to
the
merger
do
business
or
even
where
they
compete,
but
where
within
the
area
of
competitive
overlap
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
will
be
direct
and
immediate
and
i
will
now
proceed
to
show
that
this
merger
will
have
a
direct
and
immediate
effect
upon
competition
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
rule
that
out
mr.
justice
but
i
think
that
again
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
this
court
indicated
that
the
critical
inquiry
is
where
the
immediate
effect
will
be
felt
and
of
course
we're
dealing
here
with
potential
entry
to
competition.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
actual
injury.
all
the
statute
requires
where
the
effect
may
be
and
we
think
that
if
in
fact,
this
has
that
effect
in
a
relevant
market,
the
merger
cannot
be
saved
because
of
the
fact
that
the
banks
may
be
able
to
expand
into
the
peripheral
areas.
the
figures
we
have,
page
37
and
footnote
29
of
our
brief,
we
have
submitted
a
table
which
breaks
down
as
between
the
different
types
of
business,
the
sources
of
the
merging
banks
business.
the
deposit
and
loan
statistics
there
contained
showed
that
the
banks
do
roughly
85%
of
their
business
in
phillipsburg
and
easton
as
i
have
previously
indicated
in
answer
to
a
question
of
justice
stewart
that
there's
very
little
in
the
way
of
solicitation
outside
the
area
and
very
comparatively
little
done
outside
and
similarly
banks
outside
the
area
generally
do
only
solicit
in
the
area
on
rare
occasions.
indeed
the
business
is
even
more
localized
than
that.
it
seems
to
be
pretty
much
localized
within
phillipsburg
and
within
easton.
for
example,
each
of
the
merging
banks
did
only
10%
of
its
business
--
i'm
sorry,
got
only
10%
of
its
savings
and
time
deposits
from
easton.
statistics
indicate
that
almost
every
one
of
the
85,000
families
in
phillipsburg
deals
with
one
of
the
three
banks
in
that
area
and
numerous
businessmen
in
phillipsburg
testified
that
they
preferred
to
deal
with
a
local
bank
in
phillipsburg
than
to
go
across
the
river
to
easton.
it's
not
surprising
that
this
business
is
thus
localized
because
the
vast
bulk
of
the
customers
of
these
two
banks
are
small
people.
in
terms
of
the
number
of
deposits
of
these
banks
just
under
three
quarters
of
a
total
number
of
deposits
are
less
than
a
$1,000.00
and
96%
of
them
are
less
than
$10,000.00.
again,
in
terms
of
loans,
the
percentages
are
somewhat
smaller
but
nevertheless
quite
strong.
phillipsburg
national
had
roughly
three
quarters
of
its
loans
for
less
than
$2,500.00.
second
national
had
58%
and
when
you
get
to
loans
of
up
to
$10,000.00,
86
and
94%
are
less
than
$10,000.00.
now,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
these
figures
actually
reflected
the
realities
of
banking.
banking
is
essentially
local.
it's
locally
oriented
and
particularly
so
for
the
small
customers
and
convenience,
the
convenience
of
access
to
have
your
bank
near
you
is
the
important
thing.
the
merging
banks
indeed
themselves
recognized
this
because
as
the
suburban
communities
developed
four
or
five
miles
outside
the
center
of
phillipsburg,
they
open
branches
as
there
as
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
explained,
they
said
that's
where
the
customers
are.
and
furthermore,
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
pointed
out
in
response
to
a
question
that
a
great
many
of
the
loans
that
they
make
in
this
small
town
are
based
primarily
on
the
character
of
the
borrower
and
he
said
that
a
man
where
you
have
a
loan
made
on
a
character
basis,
the
people
in
phillipsburg
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
obtain
a
loan
in
any
area
outside
where
they
weren't
known.
now
the
--
the
banks
themselves
in
their
business
have
recognized
the
integrated,
localized
character
of
the
phillipsburg-easton
market.
phillipsburg
and
easton
are
in
different
federal
reserve
districts
which
means
that
normally,
their
checks
would
clear
from
different
federal
reserve
clearing
house
banks
and
this
would
obviously
cause
a
considerable
problem
so
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
established
something
they
call
the
easton-phillipsburg
clearing
house.
each
every
three
months
or
so,
one
of
the
banks
in
this
area
takes
it
turn
to
act
as
a
clearing
house
for
all
checks
drawn
on
banks
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
and
the
president
of
the
largest
bank
in
easton
in
discussing
this
arrangement
said
and
this
is
in
page
140
appendix,
he
said,
this
arrangement,
i
quote,
“seems
to
be
another
fact
which
indicates
a
closely-knit
community
even
though
separated
by
the
delaware
river.”
another
indication
of
the
integrated
nature
of
this
banking
community
is
the
fact
that
for
many
years,
banks
in
the
surrounding
area
outside
the
phillipsburg-easton
area
were
paying
4%
on
savings.
at
the
same
time,
the
easton
banks
were
paying
3%,
the
phillipsburg
banks
3.5%
but
in
1968,
when
one
of
the
banks
in
easton
increased
its
savings
rate
to
4%,
very
quickly,
all
the
rest
of
them
followed
suit.
now,
the
significance
of
all
of
these
facts
of
localization
comes
down
to
this
that
this
indicates
to
us
that
this
is
the
area
where
the
effect
of
the
merger
will
be
primarily
felt.
these
are
the
people,
the
people
who
deal
with
these
banks,
who
give
their
business
there
from
whom
the
banks
derived
a
vast
part
of
their
business.
these
are
the
people
to
whom
the
elimination
of
an
alternative
source
of
banking
will
be
hurt.
these
are
the
people
who
are
going
to
feel
it
and
this
is
in
effect
in
the
language
of
the
philadelphia
bank
case
is
where
the
merge
would
have
a
direct
and
immediate
impact.
the
basic
error
of
the
district
court,
we
think,
was
its
refusal
to
recognize
the
significance
of
this
considerations
and
instead
its
reliance
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
business
and
worked
mobility
within
the
broader
area,
that
is
people
will
drive
15
or
20
miles
to
go
to
work,
people
will
drive
as
far
as
allentown
and
bethlehem
to
shop
but
this
case,
of
course,
is
dealing
with
the
effect
of
this
merger
on
banking
not
on
other
businesses
and
the
fact
that
a
man
is
willing
to
drive
20
or
25
miles
to
work,
to
buy
a
new
suit
of
clothes,
to
buy
a
new
sofa
doesn't
mean
he's
willing
to
drive
20
or
25
miles
to
bank.
indeed,
all
the
indication
in
this
record
is
to
the
contrast.
now,
i'll
just
briefly
like
to
refer
to
one
contention
that
the
appellees
make
here
in
their
brief
which
is
that
in
any
event,
whatever
else
you
may
think
about
our
market,
phillipsburg-easton
is
not
an
economically
significant
area
of
the
country.
i
take
it
the
argument
is
too
small
and
therefore
cannot
be
a
relevant
section
of
the
country
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
they
rely
primarily
on
the
fact
that
prior
to
1950,
the
clayton
act
spoke
of
an
effect,
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
in
any
community
or
section
and
that
in
the
1950
amendments
of
the
statute,
the
word
“community”
was
deleted
and
they
rely
on
a
colloquy
before
the
senate
hearing
at
which
congressman
celler,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
act,
engaged
in
a
long
discussion
with
senator
donald
and
they
picked
certain
language
which
they
suggest
indicates
that
really
congress
never
intended
to
permit
this
small
an
area
of
the
country
to
be
relevant
section
of
the
country.
now,
for
whatever
this
kind
of
legislative
history
is
worth,
the
testimony
given
before
a
senate
committee
by
a
member
of
the
house
who
was
one
of
the
principal
sponsors
of
the
bill.
we
don't
think
it
proves
what
the
defendants
believe
it
proves
because
at
the
end
of
this
long
colloquy,
what
comes
out
of
it
is
that
mr.
celler
said
he
believed
that
the
phrase,
“section
of
the
country”
means
any
trade
area.
that's
what
they
were
talking
about
that
one
of
the
statute
to
be
able
to
reach
a
trade
area
and
we
think
that
this
area,
phillipsburg-easton
certainly
is
a
significant
trade
area
in
terms
of
commercial
banking.
within
the
phillipsburg-easton
area,
we
think
that
under
this
court's
standards
that
it
has
applied
for
determining
competitive
effect
in
horizontal
mergers,
the
effect
of
this
merger
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
as
i
have
previously
indicated
the
market
in
this,
the
banking
in
this
area
is
concentrated,
we
have
filed
with
the
court,
this
xeroxed
document
which
is
a
substitute
for
a
chart
we
have
at
page
13
of
our
brief.
unfortunately,
in
preparing
the
chart
on
page
13,
we
derived
some
of
the
figures
from
the
wrong
exhibit.
the
figures
given
in
the
narrative
on
the
following
page
15
are
correct
but
we
have
just
reproduced
this
to
give
the
correct
figures.
the
market
--
the
three
largest
banks
in
the
area,
as
i've
indicated,
have
approximately
60%
of
the
total
assets,
70%
of
the
deposits,
65%
of
the
loans.
the
result
of
this
merger
would
be
to
make
the
new
bank,
the
phillips
--
combination
of
phillipsburg
national
and
the
second
national,
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
area,
it
would
have
approximately
--
it
will
have
19.3%
of
all
the
banking
assets
in
the
area
$41
million,
23.2%
of
the
deposits
$38
million
and
27%
of
the
loans
which
is
almost
$25
million.
the
share
--
total
share
of
assets
held
by
the
three
largest
banks
would
increase
as
a
result
of
this
merger
almost
12%
to
68%,
that
is
from
60%
to
68%.
the
deposits
would
increase
to
almost
80%.
and
after
this
merger,
the
three
largest
banks
would
control
three
quarters
of
all
the
banking
offices
in
the
area,
12
out
of
16.
now,
of
course,
that's
the
impact
of
this
merger
phillipsburg-easton.
the
impact
of
the
merger
in
phillipsburg
itself
would
be
much,
much
greater.
there,
what
we
would
have,
is
you'd
have
one
bank
with
75%
of
all
the
business,
three
times
larger
than
the
other
banks,
and
this
would
eliminate
for
the
people
in
phillipsburg
one
of
three
banking
alternatives
and
i
think
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
this
merger
in
the
phillipsburg
community
is
rather
dramatically
illustrated
by
the
fact
and
i
have
to
preface
this
by
saying
we
did
not
make
this
argument
in
the
district
court
by
the
fact
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
grinnell
case,
it
would
seem
that
a
combination
which
gives
the
combined
firm
75%
of
the
market
violates
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
because
you've
got
in
one
hands
three
quarters
of
the
markets.
certainly,
that
is
enough
to
control
prices
and
exclude
competitors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
we
are
because
we
think,
that
is
as
the
district
--
and
we
think
correctly,
the
district
court
treated
that
way
and
we
think
commercial
banking
is
the
appropriate
one.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
come
to
that
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment
in
my
discussion
of
the
convenience
and
needs
but
this
court
has
held
that
the
1966
bank
merger
act
did
not
change
the
standards
for
the
determining
competitive
impact.
it
introduced
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
justice
we'd
have
to
disagree.
this
--
same
argument,
this
same
argument
was
made
in
the
nashville
case
and
in
the
nashville
case,
the
court
stated
that
it
did
not
believe
that
in
the
bank
merger
act
the
congress
intended
any
change
in
the
traditional
standards
for
determining
competitive
effect.
these
are
considerations
that
may
perhaps
be
appropriately
taken
into
account
in
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
but
in
making
the
initial
determination
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
on
the
competitive
effect,
we
think
the
standard
is
the
same.
now,
i
have
one
other
fact
which
unfortunately
we
have
not
referred
to
in
our
brief
but
i
think
is
significant.
while
we
do
not
have
in
this
market
anything
like
the
history
of
mergers
that
we
had
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
and
some
of
the
other
cases,
we
do
know
and
the
record
does
show
that
the
largest
bank
in
easton
is
the
result
of
a
merger
in
1959
which
point
two
banks
with
assets
of
$25
million
each
who
joined
to
form
this
bank
which
in
that
time
since
then
has
grown
50%
to
its
present
size
of
74
million.
now,
i'd
like
--
i
may
then
identify
but
i
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
just
read,
the
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
but
the
--
we
think
the
facts
i've
demonstrated
bring
this
case
within
the
rule
announced
in
philadelphia
bank
where
the
court
said
that
a
merger
which
produces
a
firm
controlling
an
undue
percentage
share
of
the
relevant
market
and
results
in
a
significant
increase
in
the
concentration
of
firms
in
that
market
is
so
inherently
likely
to
lessen
competition
substantially
that
it
must
be
enjoined
in
the
absence
of
evidence
clearly
showing
that
the
merger
is
not
likely
to
have
such
anticompetitive
effects.
now,
if
we're
correct
in
our
conclusion
that
this
merger
is
bad
in
terms
of
its
anticompetitive
effects
under
these
standards,
then
it
seems
to
me,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
must
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
to
that
court,
because
the
court's
balancing
test
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
were
clearly
outweighed
by
the
community
convenience
and
need.
it
seems
to
us
is
vitiated
when
the
court
has
incorrectly
calculated
one
side
of
the
scales,
as
again
in
national
bank,
the
court
recognized,
it
said,
to
weigh
adequately
one
of
these
factors
against
the
other
requires
a
proper
conclusion
as
to
each
and
we
don't
think
the
court's
conclusion
if
the
very
end
of
its
opinion
where
the
court
said
at
page
699
of
the
appellant
that
even
if
there
were
de
minimis
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
narrowly
drawn
market
proposed
by
the
government,
such
effect
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
deserved
by
the
merged
bank
constitutes
an
adequate
evaluation
of
this
factor.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
careful
balancing
that
congress
intended
before
an
anticompetitive
merger
could
be
approved.
and
therefore,
we
think
the
case
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
as
in
national
bank
properly
to
perform
the
balancing
function
but
since
the
district
court
undertook
to
determine
convenience
in
need
and
since
on
a
remand,
the
issue
would
again
arise,
we
have
fully
discussed
this
issue
and
we
think
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
it
but
we
think
the
district
court
committed
two
basic
errors
in
applying
the
convenience
and
needs
standard.
first,
we
think
it
used
the
wrong
market
area,
and
secondly,
it
misapplied
the
convenience
and
need
standard
in
several
particulars.
the
particular
provision,
the
convenience
and
need
provision,
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
61
and
the
top
of
62
of
our
brief
and
what
it
says
in
effect
is
that
where
a
merger
has
the
effect
of
--
may
effect
--
may
substantially
lessen
competition,
it
cannot
be
improved
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
proposed
transaction
are
clearly
outweighed,
clearly
outweighed
and
the
public
interest
by
the
probable
effect
of
the
transaction
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
community
to
be
served.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
case?
no
in
this
case
because
under
the
bank
merger
act,
mr.
justice,
the
filing
of
a
suit
by
the
government
within
30
days
operates
as
a
stay
and
then
the
district
court
further
extended
the
stay
pending
the
determination
of
this
appeal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
suit
was
filed
in
january
1968,
a
little
over
two
years.
the
--
the
basic
purpose
of
course
of
this
convenience
and
needs
defense
is
to
permit
bank
mergers
to
go
ahead,
go
forward,
which
even
though
they
are
anticompetitive,
produce
such
significant
benefits
to
the
community
that
on
balance
it
appears
that
the
public
interest
will
be
best
served
by
sanctioning
such
an
anticompetitive
merger.
but
it
seems
for
us
for
this
comparison
to
be
a
meaningful
one,
the
community
benefits
resulting
from
the
merger
have
to
be
assessed
in
the
same
area
as
the
community
detriments
also
resulting
from
the
merger
because
in
both
instances
which
we're
considering
are
the
banking
needs
of
the
community.
in
the
one
hand,
you
look
to
the
banking
needs
to
determine
what
the
area
is
where
the
merge
will
have
its
effect
and
then
you
look
and
turn
around
on
the
other
side
and
say
what
effect,
favorable
effect
on
the
same
banking
needs
will
the
merger
have.
now,
to
be
sure,
they
may
be
situations
in
which
a
merger
will
have
an
effect,
a
beneficial
effect
upon
a
segment
of
the
community
and
that
beneficial
effect
on
the
segment
of
the
community,
we're
down
to
that
benefit
of
the
entire
community.
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
while
that
is
permissible,
you
cannot
properly
evaluate
and
sustain
a
community
needs
defense
on
the
basis
of
benefits
to
a
narrow
segment
of
the
community
that
do
not
benefit
the
entire
community
which
is
the
relevant
area
for
testing
the
impact
of
the
merger
upon
competition
and
that
we
think
is
just
precisely
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case
in
terms
what
we
think
is
the
relevant
market,
the
phillipsburg-easton
market.
the
court
as
i
have
indicated
relied
upon
two
factors
primarily
as
in
a
ground
for
sanctioning
this
merger.
first,
the
higher
lending
limits
that
the
larger
bank
would
have.
the
bank's
lending
limits
turned
upon
its
capital
surplus,
sometimes
retained
profits,
and
so
on
and
of
course,
every
time
you
combine
two
banks,
you
get
a
larger
lending
limit.
each
of
these
banks
had
a
lending
limit
of
approximately
$100,000.00
when
you
combine
them
with
various
accounting
adjustments.
the
new
bank
would
have
a
lending
limit
of
$250,000.00
and
there
was
testimony
that
people
in
--
some
of
the
businessmen
in
--
a
number
of
businessmen
in
the
phillipsburg
area
would
like
a
bank
in
phillipsburg
with
a
larger
lending
limit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
relatively,
there's
no
statistical
evidence
on
that.
there
are
indications
that
some
of
them
have
had
to
go
outside.
in
some
instances,
the
loans
were
satisfied
through
participations.
there
some
of
them
who
testified,
they
didn't
particularly
care
to
go
outside
that
they
prefer
to
deal
with
the
phillipsburg
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
area,
mr.
justice.
this
is
the
point
i
was
coming
through
in
easton,
there
are
four
banks
whose
lending
limit
is
either
equal
to
or
substantially
in
excess
of
the
$250,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
need
but
there's
no
indication
that
it's
not
that
the
need
for
the
big
loans
as
not
being
adequately
met
in
this
area.
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
is
first
of
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
automatically
be
an
answer,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
say
the
need,
the
community
need
for
an
additional
bank
for
these
loans,
if
that's
under
that
hypothesis,
i
think
would
be
a
relatively
minor
factor
in
assessing
community
convenience.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
would
be
a
factor
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
relatively
minor
factor
and
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance,
these
loans
that
we're
talking
about
are
small
--
involved
a
small
number
of
people.
that
the
record
shows
that
during
the
average
year,
the
phillipsburg
national
bank
had
a
request
for
25
loans
in
excess
of
its
lending
limit
as
against
some
5000
loans
it
had.
the
second
national
bank,
i
think,
average
something
like
17
loans
--
had
17
requests
a
year
out
of
some
2200
loans
that
it
had,
so
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
that
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
it
shows
that.
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
exhibits
showing
as
to
each
bank
series
of
exhibits
beginning
at
pages
725
which
shows
the
percentage
of
loans
coming
from
all
of
the
different
types
of
customers
and
the
number
of
loans
that's
broken
down
into
size.
for
example,
we
have
a
group
of
loans
of
more
than
$50,000.00
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
the
percentages
could
be
calculated.
the
number
of
these
loans
for
example
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
you
can
assess
it,
mr.
justice
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
record
shows
that
the
number
of
people
seeking
these
large
loans
is
comparatively
small
and
i
think
you
have
to
compare
that,
you
have
to
compare
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
their
needs
are
being
satisfied.
if
they're
seeking
in
getting
them
in
another
bank
from
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i'm
not
suggesting
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
frivolous
mr.
justice
but
i
do
think
that
we
do
know
that
there
are
four
large
banks
in
easton,
so
in
the
broader
phillipsburg-easton
area,
there
is
no
lack
of
competition.
these
are
four
large
banks,
each
one
of
whom
could
provide
a
loan
limit
either
equal
to
that
of
the
merged
banks
or
substantially
greater.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
four
banks
in
easton
whose
lending
limits
ranged
from
$224,000.00
to
$587,000.00
i
believe.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
$587,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
easton.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
three
and
one
can
lend
$224,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
none.
the
three
banks,
their
maximum
limit
is
approximately,
roughly,
a
$100,000.00
in
phillipsburg.
and
mr.
justice,
let
me
come
to
say
one
other
thing
in
this
connection
which
is
that
there
may
be
other
ways
of
course
of
increasing
lending
limits
beside
combining
the
two
banks
into
a
bank.
we've
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
banks
that
sell
stocks.
some
of
the
banks
in
this
area
have
to
sell
stock.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
considering
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
lending
limit
is
arguably
a
stronger
one
but
even
then,
i'm
not
sure
that
basically,
that
convenience
and
need
goes
so
far
as
to
permit
the
elimination
of
competition.
i
think
it
depends
upon,
you
have
to
balance
on
the
one
hand
what
the
effect
is
on
competition,
on
the
other
hand
balance
what
the
benefits
to
community
are
and
in
concerning
benefits
to
the
community,
i
think
it's
appropriate
and
it's
necessary
to
consider
other
ways
by
which
the
banks
could
help
solve
these
problems
and
notice
that
there
was
no
other
way
in
which
they
could
increase
their
lending
limits
except
through
a
merger
and
if
it
further
appear
that
there
are
businessman
in
phillipsburg-easton
area
that
were
suffering
because
they
couldn't
get
the
money,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
significant
factor.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
turns
out
and
i
might
mention
that
some
of
the
businessmen
here
in
this
record,
for
example,
we
had
a
witness
who
was
an
official
of
a
gas
company
who
was
saying
that
he
wanted
--
he
like
the
larger
lending
limit
in
the
phillipsburg
area,
then
he
admitted
however
that
since
his
lending
demand
for
about
$2
million,
there's
no
bank
in
the
area
that
could
satisfy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
why
because
in
the
phillipsburg
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
is
in
iowa,
we
think
in
phillipsburg-easton,
if
on
the
other
hand,
you're
doing
in
phillipsburg
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
the
other
side
of
the
equation
in
phillipsburg
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
merger
are
very
drastic.
there
you
have
a
very
drastic
effect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
phillipsburg
itself
is
18,000,
the
broader
area,
the
surrounding
area
is
28,000.
easton
has
a
population
of
32,000
and
the
surrounding
area
60,000.
so
phillipsburg
and
easton
together
is
just
under
100,000.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
roughly
half
a
mile.
they're
on
opposite
sides
of
the
delaware
river.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
two
bridges.
one
free
bridge
and
one
bridge
where
you
buy
tickets
at
a
cost
of
$2.50
per
ride
and
there's
extensive
traffic
back
and
forth.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
court's
evaluation
of
the
community
convenience
and
needs
defense
was
defective
in
another
respect
that
it
doesn't
appear
that
either
the
banks
or
the
court
adequately
explored
the
possibility
of
ultimate
methods
of
achieving
this
same
benefits.
for
example,
at
the
time
of
this
merger,
new
jersey
law
permitted
banks
to
merge
within
their
own
county.
and
in
warren
county
where
phillipsburg
is
located,
there
were
at
that
time
six
other
banks
which
would
have
been
available
to
these
banks
as
merger.
in
the
city
of
washington,
about
12
miles
away,
there
were
two
banks
of
roughly
comparable
size.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it's
washington,
new
jersey
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
small
town
in
new
jersey.
two
banks
approximately
12,
13
miles
away,
both
of
the
same
size,
roughly
as
this
merging
banks
yet
the
indication
is,
the
record
shows
that
directors
never
considered
the
possibility
of
merging
with
those
other
banks.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
one
bank
in
flemington,
new
jersey
where
the
president
testified
that
over
the
years,
this
bank
had
followed
a
policy
of
not
paying
out
cash
dividends.
he
said
we
plowed
back
our
dividends
in
order
to
meet
the
growing
requirements
of
our
community
and
despite
this
lack
of
payment
of
cash
dividends,
they
recently
made
a
substantial
stock
offering
that
was
50%
over
what
was
described
and
in
addition,
the
third
bank
in
phillipsburg,
the
phillipsburg
trust
company
for
many
years
had
filed
a
practice
of
paying
only
stock
dividends
and
not
cash
dividends
in
order
to
build
up
its
capital
structure.
i
think
this
should
be
contrasted
with
the
statement
of
mr.
vargo,
the
vice
president
of
phillipsburg
national
when
he
said
that
the
bank
at
the
present
time
couldn't
hire
three
specialists
that
they
would
like
to
have.
he
said,
it
will
be
expensive
and
it
would
be
a
burden
in
our
profits
and
the
dividends
for
our
shareholders.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
phillipsburg
is
right
after
new
jersey
line.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
river.
the
river
separates
the
two
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
type
of
case?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
type
of
the
public
interest
in
this
type
of
a
case
mr.
justice,
i
think
is
preserving
for
the
large
number
of
small
bank
customers
in
the
small
areas
the
opportunity
to
preserve
the
availability
of
competing
sources
of
bank
business.
that
is
to
make
sure
that
these
people
have
the
maximum
choice.
and
of
course
banking
by
its
very
nature
in
these
small
towns
does
tend
to
be
somewhat
concentrated
and
you
have
the
problem
in
the
bank
situation.
it's
very
difficult
to
get
in
and
you
can't
just
open
a
bank
the
way
you
open
a
store.
you
have
to
get
the
approval
of
the
various
regulatory
authorities
and
once
a
bank
is
merged
out,
once
it
disappears,
that's
likely
to
be
the
end
of
it
and
the
result
is
that
if
this
merger
goes
ahead,
the
competitive
opportunities
for
the
small
people
in
this
market,
we
think,
will
be
significantly
diminished
and
that's
why
we
brought
this
case
here
and
that's
why
we're
urging
this
court
to
reverse
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
technically,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
since
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
and
that
is
the
practice
in
this
court
one
has
followed
where
it
said
since
the
cases
had
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
you'd
have
to
--
the
court
would
have
to
agree
with
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
that
the
district
court
apparently
was
going
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
product
market,
that
is
that
if
the
court
did
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
we
think
commercial
banking
was
a
relevant
market
and
we
think
that
was
correct
the
reasons
we
have
given
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
you
thought
of
course
the
other
side
hasn't
appeal
from
that
ruling
and
if
you
thought
commercial
banking
was
not
the
relevant
market,
i
suppose,
it
would
be
then
appropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
develop
some
more
evidence
as
to
what
was
the
appropriate
market
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
--
well,
again
it
would
follow
in
his
market
but
not
necessarily
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
market
because
even
in
the
phillipsburg-easton
market,
while
this
might
result
in
diminishing
some
of
the
percentages,
they
still
might
be
enough
to
prove
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
minute,
there
are
two
points
i
would
like
to
make.
one
is
a
legal
argument
and
the
other
is
to
give
some
statistics
that
the
department
has
worked
out
as
to
the
comptroller's
record
in
approving
the
merger.
the
legal
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
just
this.
the
problems
faced
by
these
two
banks
are
basically
the
same
problems
faced
by
most
banks
in
the
smaller
communities.
the
difficulty
is
they
don't
have
a
large
enough
lending
limit.
they
have
difficulty
hiring
people,
now
they'd
like
to
expand
and
we
don't
think
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
way
to
solve
these
problems
is
by
combining
two
successful
banks
that
are
directly
competing
with
each
other.
there
are
other
ways
available
to
these
banks.
the
one
thing
they
can
increase
their
capitalization.
the
record
shows
that
in
nine
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
get
bought
by
a
bigger
bank,
mr.
justice,
you're
not
eliminating
competition
between
them
even
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
department
would
mr.
justice
if
it's
just
a
small
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
but
it
seems
to
me,
they
are
very
different
situation
because
even
if
a
new
york
--
it
have
to
be
a
new
york
banks
that
sits
in
new
jersey
but
if
the
two
--
but
if
the
new
york
bank
purchased
one
of
these
banks,
you
still
have
three
competing
banks
in
the
area.
under
this
merger,
you
have
only
two
competing
banks
in
the
phillipsburg
area.
the
purchase
of
one
of
these
banks,
by
a
bank,
a
big
bank
from
outside
the
area
does
not
eliminate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
reduce
the
number
in
this
community
by
this
merger
from
seven
to
six.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
in
the
phillipsburg
area
you
reduce
it
from
three
to
two
and
that
is
it
seems
to
us
is
a
very
different
situation
in
continuing
the
number
of
banks
at
seven
but
allowing
one
of
the
banks
to
be
operated,
owned
by
a
bank
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
cut
down
to
six
but
we
think
with
an
already
concentrated
market
and
with
the
fact
that
while
you
have
one
community
of
seven,
the
indication
is
that
the
major
focus
of
banking
is
in
each
community,
we
think
that
the
elimination
of
this
number
and
it
significantly
increasing
concentration,
isn't
it.
now
if
i
might
mr.
chief
justice
because
of
the
questions
raised,
could
i
permissibly
just
indicate
some
of
the
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
summary
of
the
statistics
we
have
is
when
we
will
submit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
will
submit
a
letter
and
we'll
have
to
check
the
statistics
but
the
preliminary
information
we
have
is
that
in
the
years
1967
and
1968,
in
each
of
those
years,
the
comptroller
approved
approximately
88
mergers.
these
are
all
statistics
and
we
think
that
the
figures
roughly
approximate.
in
1967,
he
disapproved
one
and
approved
88.
in
1968
he
disapproved
any
and
in
1969,
we
have
figures
roughly
more
than
100
as
far
as
we
can
show
they
are
no
denials.
this
is
our
rough
figures
which
we
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
these
are
ones
that
were
presented
to
the
comptroller
when
we
have
it.
i
don't
know
if
there
was
a
hearing
in
all
cases.
i
was
trying
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
formal
application
and
these
do
not
cover
mergers
where
the
application
was
withdrawn
after.
well,
these
are
just
application
in
which
he
acted
and
we
will
supplement
this
and
try
to
obtain
as
accurate
figures
as
we
can.
thank
you.
