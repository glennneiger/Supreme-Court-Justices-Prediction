mr.
fowler
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
my
argument
to
only
three
points.
the
first
two
are
the
points
that
i
understand
from
mr.
strauss’s
argument
are
crucial
to
the
government’s
case.
first,
one
of
those
points
is
a
procedural
point
and
another
is
a
point
that
goes
to
the
merits.
as
i
understood
him
to
say
on
the
procedural
point
that
it
is
the
view
of
the
government
that
the
only
question
now
before
this
court
is
the
jurisdictional
question.
that
is
to
say,
did
the
secretary
of
interior
have
jurisdiction
to
cancel
claims
for
assessment
work
as
he
purported
to
do
on
two
separate
occasions
in
the
late
20’s
and
early
30’s.
we
are
--
it
is
our
view
that
that
is
incorrect.
that
is
that
that
procedural
point
is
incorrect.
it
is
our
view
to
state
it
very
summarily
before
development.
the
only
questions
before
this
court
are
precisely
the
questions
that
we
raised
in
the
district
court,
but
which
the
district
court
or
one
of
which
it
did
not
have
to
consider.
in
the
district
court,
we
object
it,
rather
sought
review
of
the
secretary's
order.
speaking
very
broadly
upon
three
grounds
that
went
to
the
merits.
one
upon
the
ground
that
this
court
had
held
that
the
secretary
had
no
jurisdiction
to
the
--
very
broadly
the
medaled
and
assessment
work
matters.
secondly,
that
even
if
that
construction
of
this
court’s
decision
in
krushnic
and
in
virginia-colorado
was
not
correct.
those
decisions
clearly
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
secretary
to
cancel
claims
for
failures
to
do
assessment
work,
even
if
that
was
not
a
jurisdictional
matter.
and
in
the
third
place
we
argued,
that
the
undisputed
facts
as
to
the
course
of
administrative
conduct,
from
the
period
of
1935
until
the
proceedings
that
ultimately
issued
in
this
case
here
were
such
that
they
had
those
--
that
administrative
conduct
had
established
an
administrative
rule
which
could
not
be
changed
retroactively.
now
the
district
court
having
found
that
in
its
view,
the
secretary
under
virginia-colorado
had
no
jurisdiction
as
to
assess
the
court
matters,
quite
naturally
did
not
go
to
the
other
due
points.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
district
court
took
the
same
position.
that
is
the
procedure,
so
that
it
is
argued
that
there
is
no
available
for
consideration
by
the
court
are
three
alternate
and
independent
positions
that
go
to
the
merits.
secondly,
we
take
the
opposite
view
of
course
that
the
government’s
position
because
the
government’s
position
as
we
understand
it
hinges
upon
its
contention
that
the
word
maintenance
in
the
saving
clause
of
the
1920
leasing
act
confers
rights
upon
the
government
with
respect
to
claims
and
reference
to
assessment
work
that
did
not
therefore
exist.
i
believe
in
response
to
question
counsel
almost
said
that
they
construed
the
word
maintenance
to
meet
an
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
thereafter
maintained.
thank
you
very
much.
thereafter
maintained
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
gist
of
their
case
that
that
means
that
assessment
work
must
be
done.
we
dispute
that.
thirdly
and
in
conclusion,
i
shall
endeavor
to
establish
that
even
if
the
question
were
now
open,
if
you
should
as
we
do
not
but
you
should
but
if
you
should
respond
to
the
government's
request,
to
reconsider
the
virginia-colorado
case
that
that
case
correctly
decided
that
the
secretary
has
no
jurisdiction
as
to
assessment
work
matters.
before
coming
to
develop
those
points
in
some
what
more
detail,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
advert
briefly
the
three
aspects
of
the
background
that
a
pertinent,
we
submit
to
the
consideration
of
those
three
questions.
one
has
to
do
with
the
development
in
respect
of
oil
shale
in
the
early
days.
another
has
to
do
with
certain
broad
historical
circumstances
that
relates
to
the
development
of
the
mining
laws
in
general.
the
place
of
the
oil
shale
question
in
perspective
and
the
third
has
to
do
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
sole
cause
of
contention
your
honor.
yes,
the
lands,
the
public
lands
that
contain
shale
oil
or
the
some
of
them,
a
limited
amount
that
is
all
cause
of
contention,
yes
sir,
within
that
historical
background.
between
1950
and
1920,
they
develop
a
great
interest
in
oil
shale
because
there
was
widespread
conviction
that
our
country
was
running
out
of
hydrocarbon
energy
because
of
the
great
draft
of
the
war
and
because
of
the
great
draft
upon
our
requirements
it
was
put
by
the
development
of
the
automobile
and
the
use
of
petroleum
instead
of
coal
and
number
of
industrial
uses.
an
oil
shale
industry
had
existed
in
the
world
since
the
17th
century.
the
scott’s
had
quite
an
active
one
in
the
19
--
in
the
20th
centuries
and
there
was
great
boom
as
all
sides
can
see
it
out
on
the
coast.
now,
in
the
western
slope
of
the
continental
divide,
colorado
primarily
some
in
utah
and
some
in
wyoming.
people
went
out
to
state
and
develop
these
claims.
this
activity
continued
down
through
the
1920’s.
prior
to
1920,
a
number
of
claims
were
staked
for
oil
shale.
the
development
work
continued
down
until
the
depression
in
the
early
1930’s.
now,
coming
against
that
background
to
the
mining
laws
themselves,
and
while
mr.
justice
black
this
case
only
considered,
it
deals
with
oil
shale.
the
law
that
is
applicable,
it
nowhere
speaks
expressly
of
oil
shale.
we’re
dealing
broadly
with
the
whole
scope
of
the
mining
laws.
and
as
you
will
recall,
the
mining
laws
are
the
principle
law
taken
in
connection
with
the
home
state
act.
under
which
approximately
2/3
of
the
total
of
2
billion
acres
at
the
various
times
our
government
has
owned
has
passed
from
public
ownership
into
private
ownership
because
as
the
country
expanded
westward,
the
government
found
itself
with
increasingly
large
quantities
of
public
land
on
its
hands
and
they
had
a
problem
of
disposing
them.
the
principle
law
was
the
mining
law.
indeed,
when
gold
was
struck
in
california
in
1848,
president
polk
--
we
refer
to
it
in
our
brief,
made
a
great
speech
about
it,
and
that
produced
the
gold
rush
at
49.
there
were
no
mining
laws.
no
laws
to
deal
with
federal
land
of
any
kind.
these
miners
went
out
there
and
they
developed
customs
and
they
enforced
these
customs
by
vigilante
measures.
all
the
people
who
developed
the
gold
in
california
were
trespassers.
the
early
cases
even
held
that
their
possessory
rights
which
were
developed
by
custom
and
enforced
by
vigilante
measures,
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
over
these
rival
claims
because
they
--
the
land
belonged
to
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
didn’t
recognize
the
right
before
mining
the
ground
on
a
large
scale
that
the
federal
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
so
the
first
mining
law
of
consequence,
it
was
perhaps
was
passed
in
1865.
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
two-fold,
the
purpose
was
to
get
peace
and
to
provide
some
kind
of
the
federal
supervision.
the
only
thing
it
provided
as
to
mining
claims
was
that
federal
court
should
have
jurisdiction
of
a
claim.
even
though
the
federal
government
owned
the
land.
secondly,
it
provided
that
the
law
of
possession,
that
is
to
say
the
custom
of
the
miners
would
determine
who
is
entitled
to
what,
in
connection
with
these
possessory
rights?
there
was
no
provision
for
a
patent.
there
was
no
provision
for
the
secretary
of
interior
or
any
other
government
agency
doing
anything.
although
the
federal
land
office
in
the
department
of
interior
of
course
have
been
established
back
in
1810.
the
next
step
was
a
passage
of
the
series
of
three
statutes
between
1866
and
1872,
and
those
in
essence
constitute
the
framework
with
which
this
court
will
decide
this
case
as
interpreted
in
the
court.
on
essence,
what
that
statutory
framework
provided
was
that
a
claim
would
be
granted,
this
is
the
first
time
there
was
a
reference
to
the
granting
of
claim.
anyone
who
discovered
valuable
minerals
on
the
land
could
comment
and
state
the
claim
and
he
got
a
possessory
right
which
as
this
court
said
in
krushnic,
without
any
action
of
any
government
agency
at
all,
he
could
mortgage,
he
could
sell,
he
could
dispose
off,
he
could
leave
by
inheritance.
there
was
not
then
and
there
never
has
been,
any
place
in
the
federal
government
where
you
can
even
find
out
where
these
mineral
claims
are.
the
policing
of
whether
or
not
the
claims
were
developed
and
how
they
are
dealt
with
was
left
solely
to
another
provision
of
the
statutory
framework.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
assessment
work
provision.
thus
the
framework
provided
that
if
a
man
did
a
$100.00
worth
of
assessment
work
on
each
claim
per
year.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
what
the
statute
says
is
that
if
a
man
will
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
work
on
each
claim
in
each
year,
that
is
called
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
a
claim
could
only
be
for
20
acres
but
eight
men
could
go
together
and
claim
a
quarter
or
section
of
land.
claim
a
160
acres
and
that
became
a
claim.
if
one
man
located
20
acres,
that
was
a
claim.
but
if
eight
men
went
in
and
pooled
their
resources
and
that
was
always
done.
they
could
get
a
160
acres
and
that
would
be
a
claim.
so
what
the
statute
said
was
that
if
these
people
spent
a
$100.00
per
claim
per
year
in
assessment
work,
their
claim
can’t
be
jumped.
what
that
meant
was
this.
if
they
didn’t
spend
the
assessment
work,
somebody
else
could
come
in
and
locate
on
that
claim.
either
for
the
same
mineral
or
for
another
mineral.
and
the
question
is
to
who
owned
the
claim
if
there
was
a
question
between
rival
claimants
was
expressly
reserved
for
the
state
court.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
trenching,
digging
holes,
putting
up
posts,
if
you
were
mining,
building
a
rudimentary
temple
or
running
of
head
in
--.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
we’ve
not
been
able
to
find
anything.
we
looked
up
at
all
the
dictionaries
but
we
just
can’t
find
anything.
i
assume
because
it
is
just
a
matter
of
conjecture,
that
probably
means
that
there
was
something
that
would
show
that
attacked
some
validity
claims
and
this
sort
of
(inaudible)
like
a
county
assessor.
but
i
just
don’t
know,
these
claims
didn’t
have
to
be
recorded
even
the
county
court
announced.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
on
the
first
place
mr.
chief
justice,
we
dissent
most
strongly
from
the
view
that
this
is
maintenance.
this
is
the
only
way
to
think
that
maintenance
can
be
--
we
think
if
do
your
assessment
work
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that’s
right.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
there
was
marked
difference
in
this
regard
and
we
think
it's
a
fairly
good
difference.
in
the
case
of
the
homestead
act
and
a
number
of
other
acts,
the
department
of
interior
has
to
decide
who
is
qualified.
they
can
determine
the
conditions
on
which
the
man
lives.
they
can
throw
him
off
at
any
time
and
he
does
not
get
a
property
right
in
the
land
until
he
has
fulfilled
their
requirements
who
lived
there
five
years,
anytime
between
then
and
the
time
he
gets
his
patent.
he
could
be
showing
off.
in
other
words
there,
the
graph
of
the
property
runs
from
the
department
of
interior
to
the
homesteader.
here,
the
graph
of
the
property
runs
under
the
congressional
act
directly
to
the
claimant
and
the
department
of
interior
not
only
has
no
authority
in
the
area
as
to
assessment
work.
whether
it
doesn’t
even
know
about
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
the
difference
in
conception
is
this.
the
case
of
the
homesteader,
the
department
of
interior
polices
to
see
whether
or
not
the
homesteader
is
in
fact
fulfilling
his
obligations
by
living
on
the
land
and
developing.
the
philosophy
and
principle
of
assessment
work
established
by
the
congress
was
that
interior
would
have
nothing
to
say
about
it,
that
they
would
rely
solely
on
competition
between
competing
miners.
to
see
to
it
that
claims
were
developed
and
in
order
to
make
that
competition
effective
what
they
said
to
the
claimant,
to
whom
the
statute
that
granted
the
claim.
if
you
don’t
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
assessment
work
per
year,
not
that
your
claim
isn’t
forfeited,
no
one
would
ever
contended
that
before
the
contentions
that
was
in
1920
case.
but
somebody
else
can
come
in
and
take
this
claim
away
from
and
relocate
it,
either
for
the
mineral
you’ve
got
or
for
the
mineral
--
some
other
mineral
and
they
went
further
in
order
to
have
this
policed
by
competition.
they
said
that
if
one
of
a
locators
wants
to
protect
his
claim
from
being
located
by
somebody
else
and
the
other
fellows
would
not
put
up
their
share
or
the
money.
he
can
give
them
notice
by
publishing
in
the
newspaper
and
know
that
it
was
mine.
then
he
can
pay,
then
he
can
forfeit
the
amount,
their
interest
out
and
he
can
then
go
ahead
and
do
the
assessment
work,
and
keep
the
claim
alive,
and
keep
other
people
from
coming.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that’s
right.
but
the
converse
is
not
necessarily
true
in
our
view.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
and
even
though
assessment
work
is
not
being
done
at
all.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
it’s
--
i’d
read
his
extensive
argument
on
that,
it
goes
in
to
the
legislative
history
and
would
it
be
agreeable
if
i
came
to
deal
with
that
separately
after
i
get
through
this
background?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
the
only
relationship
that
the
claim
owner
has
for
the
government
is
that
he
owns
the
property
and
the
claim
at
that
point.
there
was
no
relationship
in
the
department
of
interior
at
all.
he
owns
the
claim.
and
if
he
doesn’t
do
assessment
work
and
no
one
comes
along
and
tries
to
relocate,
he
still
owns
it.
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
language
in
this
court
as
we
have
construe
it
in
both
the
krushnic
case
and
in
virginia-colorado.
the
court
was
saying,
if
you
get
us
along
at
anytime
and
revise
it,
the
claim
is
maintained
because
no
one
can
relocate
it,
even
though
he
has
not
done
it
for
10
years
if
you
think
somebody
is
going
to
relocate.
he
then
comes
in
and
reestablishes
assessment
work
and
then
the
other
people
can
come
in.
so
that
all
he
had
to
do
under
the
statute
of
the
statutory
scheme
was
to
state
a
claim,
now
that
the
department
of
interior
did
come
in
at
certain
areas.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
abandoned
the
claim
and
there
is
no
charge
in
this
proceeding
at
all
despite
some
of
the
record.
the
slightest
suggestion
that
any
of
these
claims
have
ever
been
abandoned,
that
matter
if
we
prevail
in
this
case,
will
still
be
open
for
the
department
of
interior
to
raise
when
we
go
back.
if
they
think
these
claims
have
been
abandoned.
if
there
had
not
been
a
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
then
there
would
never
be
a
valid
claim
and
the
department
of
interior
could
refuse
a
patent.
even
if
there
had
been
the
discovery
of
a
gold
mine,
and
assessment
work
had
been
done.
and
no
patent
have
been
applied
for.
and
at
20
years,
the
gold
mine
had
been
worked
out
and
the
man
who
wanted
to
come
in
and
patent
because
he
wanted
to
set
up
a
hotel
or
something.
there
would
not
be
a
valuable
mineral
on
the
land
at
that
time
and
interior
could
buy
property
saying
no
patenting.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
he
didn’t
have
anything
sir
from
the
government
in
the
case
of
a
claim.
he
state
the
claim,
he
usually
as
a
matter
of
precaution,
recorded
it
in
the
county
recorder’s
office.
that
was
all.
it
was
recognized
--
do
you
see
this?
we’re
still
--
so
to
speak
at
the
(inaudible)
law
in
custom,
when
he
state
the
claim,
everybody
recognized.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
exactly
and
it
came
directly
to
him
under
the
statute.
it
was
a
full
property
right
as
is
being
conceded
here
this
morning.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
every
acre
of
the
two
billion
acres
were
federal
lands.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
which
he
could
take
the
patent
or
not
as
he
chose
and
most
of
them
had
ever
took
the
patent
because
most
of
them
worked
out
at
mine
and
went
away.
so
that
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it’s
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case,
yes
sir.
that
is
if
we
prevail
in
this
case,
then
send
it
back
to
the
department
of
interior,
if
they
think
they
can
show
abandonment.
of
course
there’ll
be
opportunity
to
sell.
similarly
if
they
can
show
a
problem.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
first
law
which
simply
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
these
possessory
rights
was
kind
of
implicit
recognition
of
them.
it
was
passed
in
1865
mr.
justice
black.
then
between
1866
and
1872,
a
series
of
acts
were
passed,
the
placer
mining
act
and
those
acts
are
the
ones
that
established
the
framework
of
the
mining
laws
in
which
oil
shale
is
simply
a
part
until
we
come
to
1920
act.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
private
interior
people
came
on.
they’ve
been
trespassers.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
a
thing,
but
he
couldn’t
get
a
patent
sir.
he
could
couldn’t
get
a
patent,
if
he
abandoned
it
or
if
he
hadn’t
discovered
a
valuable
mineral,
or
if
he
discovered
one
and
worked
it
out.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
if
he
met
the
conditions
of
the
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
if
there
was
the
dispute
between
them,
they
went
to
the
state
court.
they
didn’t
go
to
the
department
of
interior
because
the
statute
expressly
said,
all
those
matters
should
be
dealt
with
the
state
because
obviously
they
want
the
local
people
to
pass
on.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
so
that
the
man
could
determine
whether
or
not
he
could
keep
some
locator
of
his
claiming
on.
otherwise,
the
statute
said
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
exactly
and
to
provide
a
standard
so
you
could
determine
which
among
these
competing
miners
would
be
entitled
to
work
the
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
exactly
in
our
view
what
the
old
case
held.
i
think
it’d
be
clear
that
no
one
would
ever
dispute
by
description
of
the
law
until
it
becomes
in
1920.
and
even
today
on
minerals
that
are
not
in
the
mineral
act,
the
department
of
interior
doesn’t
argue
that
you
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
even
to
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
even
today
there
are
non-mineral
act
leases.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
thank
you
sir.
i
may
conclude
the
observations
that
i’ve
presented
on
the
history
of
the
mining
laws
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
assessment
work
question
if
i
may.
by
stating
that
it
has
never
been
seriously
contented
before
this
litigation
that
and
say
for
the
litigation
that
culminated
in
the
krushnic
case
and
in
the
virginia-colorado
case.
that
assessment
work
was
the
matter
of
any
concern
of
the
federal
government.
i
refer
in
this
regard
to
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
interior
which
is
quoted
on
the
first
page
of
our
brief
to
this
court.
this
regulation
is
in
virtually
the
same
form
as
it
appeared
since
at
least
1899.
and
what
it
says
is
this.
the
annual
expenditure
of
$100.00
in
labor
or
improvements
in
mining
--
on
a
mining
claim
required
by
citing
the
statute,
is
with
the
exception
of
certain
phosphate
placer
locations
validated
by
certain
acts
and
pursuant
to
certain
regulations.
solely
a
matter
between
rival
or
adverse
claimants
to
the
same
mineral
land
and
goes
only
to
the
right
of
possession.
the
determination
of
which
is
committed
exclusively
to
the
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
this
is
a
regulation
which
is
now
in
effect
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it
has
been
in
effect
since
at
least
1899
in
this
same
form
and
substance.
it’s
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
interior
as
the
statement
of
their
position
down
through
the
years.
you
would
have
noted
mr.
justice
black
that
it
refers
to
an
act
relating
to
phosphates.
prior
to
the
admission
of
alaska
and
of
the
union,
there
was
also
an
act
that
related
to
alaska
and
the
phosphate
act
and
the
alaska
act
provide
in
substance,
that
if
assessment
work
were
not
done,
then
the
claims
were
forfeited
to
the
federal
government
from
which
we
argue
of
course
that
when
congress
intended
to
cause
a
forfeiture
for
assessment
work.
it
said
so
as
it
did
in
the
alaska
act
which
became
obsolete
when
alaska
had
been
a
state
and
it
has
in
the
phosphate
act
which
is
recognized
by
the
department
to
be
an
exemption
to
this
general
doctrine.
that
the
federal
government
has
no
concern
or
responsibility,
or
rights
in
respect
to
assessment
work
and
that
leads
to
one
final
point
and
that
is
the
suggestion
was
made
this
morning
that
it
would
be
in
some
way
unconstitutional
for
the
congress
to
make
any
change
affecting
the
assessment
work
on
claims
that
are
already
vested.
we
submit
that
as
to
law
called
the
multiple
mineral
development
act
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
in
which
congress
did
precisely
that.
the
congress
provided
there
that
as
to
minerals
that
are
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act.
that
is
there
are
claims
that
are
covered
to
the
mineral
leasing
act.
anyone
could
go
in
and
locate
on
top
of
those
claims.
if
no
assessment
work
had
been
done,
so
long
as
they
were
locating
for
a
non-mineral
leasing
act
mineral.
for
example,
gold
is
not
a
mineral
leasing
act
mineral.
tomorrow,
if
the
claimants
involved
in
this
case
had
not
as
they
are
doing,
had
not
been
doing
their
assessment
work.
they’re
dong
it
because
of
this
very
statute
that
i’m
discussing.
if
they
had
not
been
doing
their
assessment
work,
tomorrow,
the
prospector
could
go
out
and
he
if
he
found
gold
there,
he
could
locate
that
claim
for
gold.
likewise
with
uranium
may
very
well
be
the
record
is
not
clear
that
much
of
your
--
that
some
of
the
uranium
that
was
discovered,
it
was
discovered
on
these
claims
which
were
subject
to
the
mineral
leasing
act
but
as
to
which
assessment
work
had
not
been
done.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
which
one
sir?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
if
he’d
abandon
sir,
he
couldn’t.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
if
he
had
abandoned
it
and
he
could
not.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
but
with
due
respect,
the
use
of
the
word
duty,
it
sends
back
the
question
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully
because
the
duty
was
that
congress,
the
way
congress
said
the
duty
would
be
enforced
we
submit,
was
by
competition
between
rival
claimants.
i
suppose
the
real
problem
was
how
to
get
rid
of
the
large
part
of
the
two
billion
acres
of
land
that
the
government
found
itself
only.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir,
but
they
did
not
make
it
a
requirement
in
the
law.
that
in
order
to
keep
it,
a
man
had
to
do
the
assessment
work.
they
didn’t
make
it
a
requirement
at
the
law
that
he
had
to
discover
a
valuable
mineral.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
suppose
that
if
the
land
be
taxable
and
the
man
hadn’t
paid
taxes.
that
if
he
demonstrated,
that
he
had
never
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
doing
anything
about
it.
that
he
had
never
referred
to
it.
that
he
hadn’t
deviced
it
in
his
will,
but
he
had
had
ranch
land.
he’d
made
provision
for
the
disposition
of
his
ranch
among
his
family.
and
he’d
ignore
this
land
that
one
would
built
up
the
case
along
those
lines
depending
upon
the
actual
circumstances.
i
should
of
course
point
out
that
abandonment
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
department
has
not
challenged
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
would
suppose
that
if
he’d
completely
ignored
it
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
taken
positive
action
to
deal
with
analogous
property
and
he’d
done
nothing
with
this
if
that
would
be
a
basis
to
argue
to
the
finders
of
fact
that
the
man
had
intended
to
abandon
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oh
no
sir,
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
the
government
in
these
very
cases
should
you
hold
as
we
urge,
you
should
hold,
that
they
can’t
challenge
them
for
failure
to
assessment
work.
we
would
then
have
to
go
back
to
the
department
of
interior
and
apply
for
a
patent
and
then
when
these
very
claims
came
up,
the
department
could
say,
“these
claims
are
invalid.
we
will
not
give
you
a
patent
because
in
fact
you
have
abandoned
them.”
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely,
in
these
very
cases.
even
if
we
figure
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
sir.
yes
sir.
you
have
to
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir.
they
can
decline
to
get
a
patent
on
the
ground
that
has
been
abandoned.
upon
the
ground
that
there
is
no
discovery
--
has
been
no
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
upon
the
ground
that
it
was
fraudulently
located
or
upon
the
ground
that
it’s
been
worked
out.
so
that
is
no
longer
a
valuable
for
mineral.
so
the
public
interest
can
be
protected
in
the
case
on
the
record.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
--yes
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
it
was.
they
have
been
condemned.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
if
the
assessment
work
had
not
been
done.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
my
position
here
is
that
the
assessment
work
is
vital
to
maintain
the
possessory
interest.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
as
against
the
other
locators.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it
cannot
do
it
unless
it
condemns
and
it
pays
for
and
then
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
multiple
mineral
development
act
of
1954
was
passed
to
permit
people
to
come
on
these
oil
shale
claims
and
locate
them,
not
the
government.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
other
locators
to
locate
them
for
non-mineral
leasing
act
minerals.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
he
would
oust.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
just
as
though
the
mineral
leasing
act
had
never
been
passed.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oil,
gas,
sodium,
oil
shale.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oil,
gas
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
the
gold
for
example
is
not
covered.
uranium
is
not
covered.
aluminum
is
not
covered.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
because
under
the
statute,
the
new
locator
would
be
locating
ex
hypothesi
on
a
claim
where
there
had
been
no
--
where
there
had
been
a
failure
to
assessment
work.
so
that
claim
then
was
subject
to
location
so
that
the
man
who
discovered
gold
could
come
in
and
get
the
claim
not
just
for
gold
but
for
everything.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
it
was
just
as
the
same
situation
that
existed
as
to
all
of
these
claims
before
1920.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
that’s
right.
he
would
indeed.
and
then
in
turn
if
he
didn’t
do
assessment
work
and
somebody
came
along
and
wanted
for
uranium,
they
could
oust
him.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
state
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
because
they
are
between
private
claimants
presumably
because
of
the
policy
of
keeping
the
cases
originally
in
the
state
courts
where
the
fact
went
out.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
you
are
making
us
question,
yes
sir
i
am.
i
only
wanted
one
point
to
touch
on
and
that
is,
between
1935
and
1961,
that
is
to
say,
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
virginia-carolina
case,
the
department
of
interior
and
we
submit
that
the
evidences
is
uncontradicted
the
uncontradictable
administered
these
lands
as
it
stated
time
and
time
again
upon
the
principle,
that
the
old
assessment
work
decisions
were
invalid,
void,
and
have
no
effect.
as
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
government’s
response
to
our
interrogatories
in
which
they
said
they
had
no
evidence
that
any
government
official
had
ever
taken
any
act
or
had
done
anything
on
the
assumption
that
these
claims
were
in
any
way
tinged
within
validity
because
of
the
old
assessment
work
decisions.
furthermore,
we
described
in
detail
in
our
brief
the
circumstances
that
show
that
the
existence
of
these
claims
did
not
in
any
way
impair
the
use
of
land
for
public
parks.
the
use
of
it
for
reservoirs
or
for
any
other
purpose,
because
these
claims
just
like
any
other
claims
are
always
generally
accepted.
whenever
there
is
a
reservation
of
government
land.
the
government
says,
“this
reservation
shall
apply
only
to
the
public
land
that
is
not
encumbered
by
claims”
now
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
is
no
way
for
the
government
to
know
what
land
has
claims
or
not
unless
he
goes
out
and
searches
the
local
county
offices.
so
that
the
practice
is
always
been,
whenever
a
grant
is
made
of
public
lands
for
any
of
the
purposes,
they
are
discussed
in
the
government’s
brief
to
contain
a
reservation.
for
example
in
1916,
oil
shale
as
it
refers
tend
to
be
valuable
minerals.
the
geological
survey
said,
we
do
not
want
them
reserved
because
we
want
to
keep
them
open
for
location
and
grant
because
we
want
to
have
these
possesses
developed
to
get
the
shale
out.
the
navy
wanted
a
reservation
of
oil
shale
land.
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
reservation
would
not
cover
claims.
they
ask
and
got
a
reservation
of
twice
as
much
land
as
they
thought
they
needed
because
they
anticipated
that
about
half
of
them
would
be
covered
with
claims.
that
is
our
response
spelled
out
in
our
brief
to
the
government's
contention
that
the
existence
of
these
claims
in
any
way
has
interfered
with
the
operation
of
these
public
lands.
these
claims
haven’t
done
it
anymore
than
any
other
claims
such
as
claims
uranium
etcetera
that
are
not
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
government
--
if
the
government
goes
out
and
finds
a
man
on
government
property
and
they
say
he
has
no
right
to
it,
they
can
--
he’s
a
trespasser
and
they
can
evict
him,
then
if
he
wants
to
litigate
presumably,
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
some
place
because
he’s
claiming
they’re
taking
his
property.
and
then
they
can
litigate
out
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
infact
abandoned
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir,
because
they
cannot
evict
him
for
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
they
can
evict
him.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir?
he's
abandoned.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
the
language,
that
is
correct
sir.
but
mr.
justice
black,
i
submit
that
the
language
in
the
virginia-colorado
case
speaks
only
the
question
of
the
assessment
work.
it
doesn’t
talk
about
other
ways
of
maintaining
a
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
and
he
gets
no
right
unless
he
has
discovered
valuable
minerals
in
series
of
companion
cases
we’re
litigating
that
with
the
government
now.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
once
you
have
a
valid
claim,
then
you
have
to
do
$500.00
worth
of
work.
you
can
do
it
in
one
year
or
40
and
then
you
file
an
application
for
a
patent.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
you
have
to
have
discovered.
you
file
an
application
for
a
patent
and
you
allege
that
you
have
a
valid
claim
and
that
you
have
made
a
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral.
then
the
department
of
interior
people
send
people
out
as
they
did
on
this
penelope
baron’s
case
three
times
and
found
she
had
a
valid
claim.
they’d
look
at
it
if
the
inspector
thinks
it’s
been
abandoned,
he
writes
a
report
and
they
don’t
grant
the
patent.
he
acquires
in
the
community.
he
says,
“who
owns
this
thing
or
they
are
done
about
it”
if
the
mineral
showing
is
not
sufficient
to
constitute,
the
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral,
he
writes
a
report
and
recommends
against
it.
and
then
the
patent
claim
is
rejected.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
right.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
and
since
about
1927,
it
can
go
forward
and
do
it
on
its
motion.
in
other
words,
if
it
wants
to
build
a
dam,
i
think
there’s
a
lot
of
a
valueless
claim
out
there.
it
confined
the
claimants,
make
publication,
and
clear
this
land
of
claims.
and
if
they
don’t
come
in
and
defend
it,
which
i
suppose
in
practical
matters
one
of
the
ways
on
abandonment
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
they’d
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
to
the
land,
all
of
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
however,
many
acres
are
covered
by
claims
sir.
in
this
case,
here
for
example,
what
happened
was
that
there
were
18
claims
pending
under
the
department
of
interior,
18
applications
for
patents
covering
about
250
claims
of
160
acres
each
so
that
that’s
about
35,000
acres.
and
what
happened
was
that
the
solicitor
of
interior
issued
instructions
to
the
field
office
to
reject
these
applications
upon
the
ground
that
these
old
assessment
work
decisions
were
res
judicata.
he
did
so.
then
the
solicitor
took
--
there
was
no
notice
to
anybody
about
this.
no
operative
will
be
heard,
nothing.
then
the
solicitor
took
the
cases
up,
reviewed
them
on
appeal
and
confirmed
his
original
instruction
in
a
decision
called
the
union
oil
case
which
is
the
one
which
is
involved
here.
in
which
he
conceded
that
the
--
there
was
a
right
of
appeal
in
1935
to
the
courts
but
he
held
that
there
had
been
latches.
the
trial
in
the
court
below
was
solely
on
the
question
of
latches
because
we
introduced
voluminous
evidence
all
from
the
government
files
to
show
this
unbroken
conduct
where
they
had
recognized
the
validity
of
these
claims.
in
our
briefs,
we
have
set
forth
the
number
of
acres
that
were
patented
on
page
40
in
a
map.
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
land
has
been
patented
in
colorado
and
it’s
the
big
part
of
the
land
that’s
been
patented
for
oil
share
was
covered
by
these
decisions.
so
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
disputable
that
there
is
no
latches.
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
latches,
they
said
there's
been
a
dearth
of
any
evidence
and
the
tenth
circuit
confirmed
that.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
see.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
they
have
a
hearing
in
the
department.
they
have
a
hearing
within
the
department
of
interior.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
then,
he
can
appeal
either
to
the
land
office
or
what
is
usually
the
practice
in
large
cases
for
the
secretary
of
interior
to
hear
the
appeal
himself
or
have
it
heard
by
someone
to
whom
he
delegates
it.
and
within
the
last
year
there
has
been
set
up
in
the
department,
an
appeals
board
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
appeals
from
mineral
examiners.
after
the
hearing
there
is
a
record
made
before
the
examiner.
then
you
can
go
up
intermediately
to
the
head
of
the
land
office
or
as
its
usually
done
in
large
cases,
directly
to
the
secretary
who
up
until
a
year
ago
had
the
matter
decided
by
the
solicitor,
that’s
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
same
gentleman
who
gave
these
instructions
then
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
union
oil
case.
now
the
secretary
has
set
up
an
appeals
board,
then
you
go
the
appeals
board,
then
it
is
reviewed
by
the
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
the
federal
courts,
that’s
right
sir.
then
it
goes
to
the
federal
courts.
now
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
right
sir.
or,
since
recent
years
where
this
court
has
sustained
the
right
of
the
interior
to
attack
patents
at
its
own
initiative,
originally
that
was
not
clear.
now,
they
can
go
out
and
challenge
claims
and
force
the
claimant
to
come
in
and
defend
his
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
waiting
for
him
to
assert
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
right.
yes
sir.
they
dealt
with
those
of
the
things.
now
i
come
sir
to
your
question
on
maintenance,
to
maintain.
we
think
the
background
that
is
not
uncomplicated
but
we
believe
it’s
clear.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
background
of
it
is
this
briefly.
if
you
recall
that
the
mining
laws
that
i
have
described
which
there
was
a
direct
grant
of
a
claim
went
back
primarily
what's
called
--
so-called
hardrock
metals,
they
came
out
of
the
gold
rush
to
california
and
a
hardrock
minerals
unlike
petroleum
and
natural
gas
are
found
characteristically
either
in
loads
in
which
you
have
a
vain
which
under
our
law
as
you
know
you
can
follow
wherever
the
gold
goes
or
there
are
placer
claims
like
those
out
in
the
open
where
you
--
like
gold
in
a
river
bed.
in
the
‘90’s,
the
last
session,
the
question
came
up
as
to
which
one
of
this
categories,
oil
and
gas
fitted
in.
the
interior
said
first
it
is
patentable
as
a
placer,
then
the
interior,
the
secretary
said
he
didn’t
think
it
was
then
he
finally
said
he
thought
oil
and
gas
was
and
finally
congress
confirmed
that
by
saying
that
oil
and
gas
was
patentable
as
a
placer.
then
the
question
arose
because
in
1909,
oil
and
gas
were
going
to
be
withdrawn
from
further
location
and
the
interior
in
connection
with
various
withdrawals
that
it
had
made,
had
decided
that
if
a
man
was
looking
for
oil
or
gas
and
was
drilling
and
hadn’t
hit
it
but
was
still
looking,
it
was
unfair
to
cut
him
off
even
though
he
hadn’t
made
a
discovery.
so
they
established
the
administrative
rule
that
when
–
in
connection
with
oil
and
gas,
there
was
a
withdrawal
and
a
prospect,
he
was
looking.
so
long
as
he
went
right
ahead
and
kept
looking,
if
he
found
it
and
made
a
discovery,
he
got
the
claim
even
though
as
a
technical
matter
under
the
mining
laws,
no
claim
vested
until
the
discovery.
so
this
was
a
kind
of
a
special
or
quasi
or
in-court
claim.
now,
when
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
passed,
this
question
arose
in
the
congress
because
they
said,
the
interior
said,
“what
are
we
going
to
do
about
these
different
kind
of
claims
that
aren't
real
claims
because
no
discovery
has
happened?”
so
they
put
in
this
provision
that
so
long
as
the
oil
or
gas
matter
was
directed,
maintained
the
claim
by
going
forward
to
seek
discovery,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
claim
even
though
at
the
time
the
act
vested,
he
had
not
a
claim
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word.
and
the
papers
that
are
set
forth
in
the
government’s
amended
reply
brief,
we
submit
make
perfectly
clear
that
what
mr.
vogelsang
was
saying
to
people
on
the
hill
was,
if
this
law
goes
through
without
some
kind
of
a
saving
clause,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
this
oil
and
gas
leases?
the
last
sentence
in
the
last
--
one
of
those
letters,
last
letter,
we
think
makes
that
clear.
mr.
senate
who
was
a
congressman
in
responding
to
mr.
vogelsang
said,
“i
do
not
know
that
i
just
understand
your
reference
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
two
to
the
$100.00
work
of
a
labor
or
assessment
work.
do
you
have
in
mind
assessment
work
under
the
state
laws
or
under
the
federal
statutes?
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
federal
state
assessment
work,
work
is
required
only
after
discovery,
the
point
being
that
you
didn’t
have
any
claim
in
an
oil
shale
situation
until
you
had
discovery.”
so
that
when
we
come
against
that
background,
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
krushnic
and
in
virginia-colorado,
we
submit
that
it’s
clear
that
what
the
court
was
saying
there
was
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
matter
in
the
second
case.
the
interior
department
only
has
jurisdiction
to
do
these
various
things
with
respect
to
abandonment
of
discovery
because
they
have
a
duty
to
issue
the
patent.
justice
brandeis
in
the
very
clear
and
recent
decisions,
its
quoted
in
our
brief
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
department
originally
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all.
there's
no
statute
that
gives
the
department
of
interior
jurisdiction
to
hold
or
contest
proceedings
to
do
any
of
these
things.
as
he
points
out
there,
the
department
has
jurisdiction
only
where
and
i
think
i
should
perhaps
refer
to
his
specific
language,
only
what
he
said
was,
“jurisdiction
is
conferred
upon
the
secretary
giving
him
the
power
to
make
all
determinations
of
all
as
well
as
fact
which
are
essential
to
the
performance
of
the
duties
specifically
imposed
and
we
submit
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
was
saying
in
virginia-colorado,
there
is
no
duty
specifically
imposed
with
respect
to
assessment
work.
it
is
only
imposed
with
respect
to
granting
of
the
patent.
you
don’t
have
to
do
assessment
work
to
get
a
patent.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i’m
reading
sir
from
mr.
justice
brandeis’
decision
in
west,
278
us
20.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
on
the
basis
of
that
analysis
that
the
two
things:
one;
that
the
virginia-carolina
case
was
the
case
of
jurisdiction
and
also
that
it
was
a
case
that
was
rightly
decided
of
jurisdiction
so
that
if
it
were
up
new,
it
would
be
decided,
should
be
decided
the
same
way.
thank
you.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
may
i
just
make
one
comment
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
in
connection
with
maintenance,
i
have
given
you
our
view
of
the
genesis
of
the
phrase,
“to
maintain.”
we
think
that
when
chief
justice
hughes
was
discussing
in
the
latter
paragraph
in
which
he
said
a
claim
could
be
maintained
by
doing
assessment
work.
he
was
answering
in
effect
to
a
rhetorical
question
that
would
have
been
to
put
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
argument
in
the
brief
so
that
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
definition,
a
claim
can
be
maintained
against
other
people
an
relocators
by
doing
assessment
work.
it
can
be
maintained
against
the
government
by
not
abandoning
it.
it
can
be
maintained
against
the
government.
in
other
words,
by
doing
all
of
those
things
that
are
necessary
to
qualify
you
for
a
patent.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
address
my
argument
to
only
three
points.
the
first
two
are
the
points
that
i
understand
from
mr.
strauss’s
argument
are
crucial
to
the
government’s
case.
first,
one
of
those
points
is
a
procedural
point
and
another
is
a
point
that
goes
to
the
merits.
as
i
understood
him
to
say
on
the
procedural
point
that
it
is
the
view
of
the
government
that
the
only
question
now
before
this
court
is
the
jurisdictional
question.
that
is
to
say,
did
the
secretary
of
interior
have
jurisdiction
to
cancel
claims
for
assessment
work
as
he
purported
to
do
on
two
separate
occasions
in
the
late
20’s
and
early
30’s.
we
are
--
it
is
our
view
that
that
is
incorrect.
that
is
that
that
procedural
point
is
incorrect.
it
is
our
view
to
state
it
very
summarily
before
development.
the
only
questions
before
this
court
are
precisely
the
questions
that
we
raised
in
the
district
court,
but
which
the
district
court
or
one
of
which
it
did
not
have
to
consider.
in
the
district
court,
we
object
it,
rather
sought
review
of
the
secretary's
order.
speaking
very
broadly
upon
three
grounds
that
went
to
the
merits.
one
upon
the
ground
that
this
court
had
held
that
the
secretary
had
no
jurisdiction
to
the
--
very
broadly
the
medaled
and
assessment
work
matters.
secondly,
that
even
if
that
construction
of
this
court’s
decision
in
krushnic
and
in
virginia-colorado
was
not
correct.
those
decisions
clearly
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
secretary
to
cancel
claims
for
failures
to
do
assessment
work,
even
if
that
was
not
a
jurisdictional
matter.
and
in
the
third
place
we
argued,
that
the
undisputed
facts
as
to
the
course
of
administrative
conduct,
from
the
period
of
1935
until
the
proceedings
that
ultimately
issued
in
this
case
here
were
such
that
they
had
those
--
that
administrative
conduct
had
established
an
administrative
rule
which
could
not
be
changed
retroactively.
now
the
district
court
having
found
that
in
its
view,
the
secretary
under
virginia-colorado
had
no
jurisdiction
as
to
assess
the
court
matters,
quite
naturally
did
not
go
to
the
other
due
points.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
district
court
took
the
same
position.
that
is
the
procedure,
so
that
it
is
argued
that
there
is
no
available
for
consideration
by
the
court
are
three
alternate
and
independent
positions
that
go
to
the
merits.
secondly,
we
take
the
opposite
view
of
course
that
the
government’s
position
because
the
government’s
position
as
we
understand
it
hinges
upon
its
contention
that
the
word
maintenance
in
the
saving
clause
of
the
1920
leasing
act
confers
rights
upon
the
government
with
respect
to
claims
and
reference
to
assessment
work
that
did
not
therefore
exist.
i
believe
in
response
to
question
counsel
almost
said
that
they
construed
the
word
maintenance
to
meet
an
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
thereafter
maintained.
thank
you
very
much.
thereafter
maintained
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
gist
of
their
case
that
that
means
that
assessment
work
must
be
done.
we
dispute
that.
thirdly
and
in
conclusion,
i
shall
endeavor
to
establish
that
even
if
the
question
were
now
open,
if
you
should
as
we
do
not
but
you
should
but
if
you
should
respond
to
the
government's
request,
to
reconsider
the
virginia-colorado
case
that
that
case
correctly
decided
that
the
secretary
has
no
jurisdiction
as
to
assessment
work
matters.
before
coming
to
develop
those
points
in
some
what
more
detail,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
advert
briefly
the
three
aspects
of
the
background
that
a
pertinent,
we
submit
to
the
consideration
of
those
three
questions.
one
has
to
do
with
the
development
in
respect
of
oil
shale
in
the
early
days.
another
has
to
do
with
certain
broad
historical
circumstances
that
relates
to
the
development
of
the
mining
laws
in
general.
the
place
of
the
oil
shale
question
in
perspective
and
the
third
has
to
do
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
sole
cause
of
contention
your
honor.
yes,
the
lands,
the
public
lands
that
contain
shale
oil
or
the
some
of
them,
a
limited
amount
that
is
all
cause
of
contention,
yes
sir,
within
that
historical
background.
between
1950
and
1920,
they
develop
a
great
interest
in
oil
shale
because
there
was
widespread
conviction
that
our
country
was
running
out
of
hydrocarbon
energy
because
of
the
great
draft
of
the
war
and
because
of
the
great
draft
upon
our
requirements
it
was
put
by
the
development
of
the
automobile
and
the
use
of
petroleum
instead
of
coal
and
number
of
industrial
uses.
an
oil
shale
industry
had
existed
in
the
world
since
the
17th
century.
the
scott’s
had
quite
an
active
one
in
the
19
--
in
the
20th
centuries
and
there
was
great
boom
as
all
sides
can
see
it
out
on
the
coast.
now,
in
the
western
slope
of
the
continental
divide,
colorado
primarily
some
in
utah
and
some
in
wyoming.
people
went
out
to
state
and
develop
these
claims.
this
activity
continued
down
through
the
1920’s.
prior
to
1920,
a
number
of
claims
were
staked
for
oil
shale.
the
development
work
continued
down
until
the
depression
in
the
early
1930’s.
now,
coming
against
that
background
to
the
mining
laws
themselves,
and
while
mr.
justice
black
this
case
only
considered,
it
deals
with
oil
shale.
the
law
that
is
applicable,
it
nowhere
speaks
expressly
of
oil
shale.
we’re
dealing
broadly
with
the
whole
scope
of
the
mining
laws.
and
as
you
will
recall,
the
mining
laws
are
the
principle
law
taken
in
connection
with
the
home
state
act.
under
which
approximately
2/3
of
the
total
of
2
billion
acres
at
the
various
times
our
government
has
owned
has
passed
from
public
ownership
into
private
ownership
because
as
the
country
expanded
westward,
the
government
found
itself
with
increasingly
large
quantities
of
public
land
on
its
hands
and
they
had
a
problem
of
disposing
them.
the
principle
law
was
the
mining
law.
indeed,
when
gold
was
struck
in
california
in
1848,
president
polk
--
we
refer
to
it
in
our
brief,
made
a
great
speech
about
it,
and
that
produced
the
gold
rush
at
49.
there
were
no
mining
laws.
no
laws
to
deal
with
federal
land
of
any
kind.
these
miners
went
out
there
and
they
developed
customs
and
they
enforced
these
customs
by
vigilante
measures.
all
the
people
who
developed
the
gold
in
california
were
trespassers.
the
early
cases
even
held
that
their
possessory
rights
which
were
developed
by
custom
and
enforced
by
vigilante
measures,
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
over
these
rival
claims
because
they
--
the
land
belonged
to
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
didn’t
recognize
the
right
before
mining
the
ground
on
a
large
scale
that
the
federal
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
so
the
first
mining
law
of
consequence,
it
was
perhaps
was
passed
in
1865.
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
two-fold,
the
purpose
was
to
get
peace
and
to
provide
some
kind
of
the
federal
supervision.
the
only
thing
it
provided
as
to
mining
claims
was
that
federal
court
should
have
jurisdiction
of
a
claim.
even
though
the
federal
government
owned
the
land.
secondly,
it
provided
that
the
law
of
possession,
that
is
to
say
the
custom
of
the
miners
would
determine
who
is
entitled
to
what,
in
connection
with
these
possessory
rights?
there
was
no
provision
for
a
patent.
there
was
no
provision
for
the
secretary
of
interior
or
any
other
government
agency
doing
anything.
although
the
federal
land
office
in
the
department
of
interior
of
course
have
been
established
back
in
1810.
the
next
step
was
a
passage
of
the
series
of
three
statutes
between
1866
and
1872,
and
those
in
essence
constitute
the
framework
with
which
this
court
will
decide
this
case
as
interpreted
in
the
court.
on
essence,
what
that
statutory
framework
provided
was
that
a
claim
would
be
granted,
this
is
the
first
time
there
was
a
reference
to
the
granting
of
claim.
anyone
who
discovered
valuable
minerals
on
the
land
could
comment
and
state
the
claim
and
he
got
a
possessory
right
which
as
this
court
said
in
krushnic,
without
any
action
of
any
government
agency
at
all,
he
could
mortgage,
he
could
sell,
he
could
dispose
off,
he
could
leave
by
inheritance.
there
was
not
then
and
there
never
has
been,
any
place
in
the
federal
government
where
you
can
even
find
out
where
these
mineral
claims
are.
the
policing
of
whether
or
not
the
claims
were
developed
and
how
they
are
dealt
with
was
left
solely
to
another
provision
of
the
statutory
framework.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
assessment
work
provision.
thus
the
framework
provided
that
if
a
man
did
a
$100.00
worth
of
assessment
work
on
each
claim
per
year.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
what
the
statute
says
is
that
if
a
man
will
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
work
on
each
claim
in
each
year,
that
is
called
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
a
claim
could
only
be
for
20
acres
but
eight
men
could
go
together
and
claim
a
quarter
or
section
of
land.
claim
a
160
acres
and
that
became
a
claim.
if
one
man
located
20
acres,
that
was
a
claim.
but
if
eight
men
went
in
and
pooled
their
resources
and
that
was
always
done.
they
could
get
a
160
acres
and
that
would
be
a
claim.
so
what
the
statute
said
was
that
if
these
people
spent
a
$100.00
per
claim
per
year
in
assessment
work,
their
claim
can’t
be
jumped.
what
that
meant
was
this.
if
they
didn’t
spend
the
assessment
work,
somebody
else
could
come
in
and
locate
on
that
claim.
either
for
the
same
mineral
or
for
another
mineral.
and
the
question
is
to
who
owned
the
claim
if
there
was
a
question
between
rival
claimants
was
expressly
reserved
for
the
state
court.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
trenching,
digging
holes,
putting
up
posts,
if
you
were
mining,
building
a
rudimentary
temple
or
running
of
head
in
--.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
we’ve
not
been
able
to
find
anything.
we
looked
up
at
all
the
dictionaries
but
we
just
can’t
find
anything.
i
assume
because
it
is
just
a
matter
of
conjecture,
that
probably
means
that
there
was
something
that
would
show
that
attacked
some
validity
claims
and
this
sort
of
(inaudible)
like
a
county
assessor.
but
i
just
don’t
know,
these
claims
didn’t
have
to
be
recorded
even
the
county
court
announced.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
on
the
first
place
mr.
chief
justice,
we
dissent
most
strongly
from
the
view
that
this
is
maintenance.
this
is
the
only
way
to
think
that
maintenance
can
be
--
we
think
if
do
your
assessment
work
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that’s
right.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
there
was
marked
difference
in
this
regard
and
we
think
it's
a
fairly
good
difference.
in
the
case
of
the
homestead
act
and
a
number
of
other
acts,
the
department
of
interior
has
to
decide
who
is
qualified.
they
can
determine
the
conditions
on
which
the
man
lives.
they
can
throw
him
off
at
any
time
and
he
does
not
get
a
property
right
in
the
land
until
he
has
fulfilled
their
requirements
who
lived
there
five
years,
anytime
between
then
and
the
time
he
gets
his
patent.
he
could
be
showing
off.
in
other
words
there,
the
graph
of
the
property
runs
from
the
department
of
interior
to
the
homesteader.
here,
the
graph
of
the
property
runs
under
the
congressional
act
directly
to
the
claimant
and
the
department
of
interior
not
only
has
no
authority
in
the
area
as
to
assessment
work.
whether
it
doesn’t
even
know
about
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
the
difference
in
conception
is
this.
the
case
of
the
homesteader,
the
department
of
interior
polices
to
see
whether
or
not
the
homesteader
is
in
fact
fulfilling
his
obligations
by
living
on
the
land
and
developing.
the
philosophy
and
principle
of
assessment
work
established
by
the
congress
was
that
interior
would
have
nothing
to
say
about
it,
that
they
would
rely
solely
on
competition
between
competing
miners.
to
see
to
it
that
claims
were
developed
and
in
order
to
make
that
competition
effective
what
they
said
to
the
claimant,
to
whom
the
statute
that
granted
the
claim.
if
you
don’t
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
assessment
work
per
year,
not
that
your
claim
isn’t
forfeited,
no
one
would
ever
contended
that
before
the
contentions
that
was
in
1920
case.
but
somebody
else
can
come
in
and
take
this
claim
away
from
and
relocate
it,
either
for
the
mineral
you’ve
got
or
for
the
mineral
--
some
other
mineral
and
they
went
further
in
order
to
have
this
policed
by
competition.
they
said
that
if
one
of
a
locators
wants
to
protect
his
claim
from
being
located
by
somebody
else
and
the
other
fellows
would
not
put
up
their
share
or
the
money.
he
can
give
them
notice
by
publishing
in
the
newspaper
and
know
that
it
was
mine.
then
he
can
pay,
then
he
can
forfeit
the
amount,
their
interest
out
and
he
can
then
go
ahead
and
do
the
assessment
work,
and
keep
the
claim
alive,
and
keep
other
people
from
coming.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that’s
right.
but
the
converse
is
not
necessarily
true
in
our
view.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
and
even
though
assessment
work
is
not
being
done
at
all.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
it’s
--
i’d
read
his
extensive
argument
on
that,
it
goes
in
to
the
legislative
history
and
would
it
be
agreeable
if
i
came
to
deal
with
that
separately
after
i
get
through
this
background?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
the
only
relationship
that
the
claim
owner
has
for
the
government
is
that
he
owns
the
property
and
the
claim
at
that
point.
there
was
no
relationship
in
the
department
of
interior
at
all.
he
owns
the
claim.
and
if
he
doesn’t
do
assessment
work
and
no
one
comes
along
and
tries
to
relocate,
he
still
owns
it.
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
language
in
this
court
as
we
have
construe
it
in
both
the
krushnic
case
and
in
virginia-colorado.
the
court
was
saying,
if
you
get
us
along
at
anytime
and
revise
it,
the
claim
is
maintained
because
no
one
can
relocate
it,
even
though
he
has
not
done
it
for
10
years
if
you
think
somebody
is
going
to
relocate.
he
then
comes
in
and
reestablishes
assessment
work
and
then
the
other
people
can
come
in.
so
that
all
he
had
to
do
under
the
statute
of
the
statutory
scheme
was
to
state
a
claim,
now
that
the
department
of
interior
did
come
in
at
certain
areas.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
abandoned
the
claim
and
there
is
no
charge
in
this
proceeding
at
all
despite
some
of
the
record.
the
slightest
suggestion
that
any
of
these
claims
have
ever
been
abandoned,
that
matter
if
we
prevail
in
this
case,
will
still
be
open
for
the
department
of
interior
to
raise
when
we
go
back.
if
they
think
these
claims
have
been
abandoned.
if
there
had
not
been
a
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
then
there
would
never
be
a
valid
claim
and
the
department
of
interior
could
refuse
a
patent.
even
if
there
had
been
the
discovery
of
a
gold
mine,
and
assessment
work
had
been
done.
and
no
patent
have
been
applied
for.
and
at
20
years,
the
gold
mine
had
been
worked
out
and
the
man
who
wanted
to
come
in
and
patent
because
he
wanted
to
set
up
a
hotel
or
something.
there
would
not
be
a
valuable
mineral
on
the
land
at
that
time
and
interior
could
buy
property
saying
no
patenting.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
he
didn’t
have
anything
sir
from
the
government
in
the
case
of
a
claim.
he
state
the
claim,
he
usually
as
a
matter
of
precaution,
recorded
it
in
the
county
recorder’s
office.
that
was
all.
it
was
recognized
--
do
you
see
this?
we’re
still
--
so
to
speak
at
the
(inaudible)
law
in
custom,
when
he
state
the
claim,
everybody
recognized.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
exactly
and
it
came
directly
to
him
under
the
statute.
it
was
a
full
property
right
as
is
being
conceded
here
this
morning.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
every
acre
of
the
two
billion
acres
were
federal
lands.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
which
he
could
take
the
patent
or
not
as
he
chose
and
most
of
them
had
ever
took
the
patent
because
most
of
them
worked
out
at
mine
and
went
away.
so
that
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it’s
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case,
yes
sir.
that
is
if
we
prevail
in
this
case,
then
send
it
back
to
the
department
of
interior,
if
they
think
they
can
show
abandonment.
of
course
there’ll
be
opportunity
to
sell.
similarly
if
they
can
show
a
problem.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
first
law
which
simply
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
these
possessory
rights
was
kind
of
implicit
recognition
of
them.
it
was
passed
in
1865
mr.
justice
black.
then
between
1866
and
1872,
a
series
of
acts
were
passed,
the
placer
mining
act
and
those
acts
are
the
ones
that
established
the
framework
of
the
mining
laws
in
which
oil
shale
is
simply
a
part
until
we
come
to
1920
act.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
private
interior
people
came
on.
they’ve
been
trespassers.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
a
thing,
but
he
couldn’t
get
a
patent
sir.
he
could
couldn’t
get
a
patent,
if
he
abandoned
it
or
if
he
hadn’t
discovered
a
valuable
mineral,
or
if
he
discovered
one
and
worked
it
out.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
if
he
met
the
conditions
of
the
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
if
there
was
the
dispute
between
them,
they
went
to
the
state
court.
they
didn’t
go
to
the
department
of
interior
because
the
statute
expressly
said,
all
those
matters
should
be
dealt
with
the
state
because
obviously
they
want
the
local
people
to
pass
on.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
so
that
the
man
could
determine
whether
or
not
he
could
keep
some
locator
of
his
claiming
on.
otherwise,
the
statute
said
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
exactly
and
to
provide
a
standard
so
you
could
determine
which
among
these
competing
miners
would
be
entitled
to
work
the
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
exactly
in
our
view
what
the
old
case
held.
i
think
it’d
be
clear
that
no
one
would
ever
dispute
by
description
of
the
law
until
it
becomes
in
1920.
and
even
today
on
minerals
that
are
not
in
the
mineral
act,
the
department
of
interior
doesn’t
argue
that
you
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
even
to
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
even
today
there
are
non-mineral
act
leases.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
thank
you
sir.
i
may
conclude
the
observations
that
i’ve
presented
on
the
history
of
the
mining
laws
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
assessment
work
question
if
i
may.
by
stating
that
it
has
never
been
seriously
contented
before
this
litigation
that
and
say
for
the
litigation
that
culminated
in
the
krushnic
case
and
in
the
virginia-colorado
case.
that
assessment
work
was
the
matter
of
any
concern
of
the
federal
government.
i
refer
in
this
regard
to
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
interior
which
is
quoted
on
the
first
page
of
our
brief
to
this
court.
this
regulation
is
in
virtually
the
same
form
as
it
appeared
since
at
least
1899.
and
what
it
says
is
this.
the
annual
expenditure
of
$100.00
in
labor
or
improvements
in
mining
--
on
a
mining
claim
required
by
citing
the
statute,
is
with
the
exception
of
certain
phosphate
placer
locations
validated
by
certain
acts
and
pursuant
to
certain
regulations.
solely
a
matter
between
rival
or
adverse
claimants
to
the
same
mineral
land
and
goes
only
to
the
right
of
possession.
the
determination
of
which
is
committed
exclusively
to
the
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
this
is
a
regulation
which
is
now
in
effect
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it
has
been
in
effect
since
at
least
1899
in
this
same
form
and
substance.
it’s
a
regulation
of
the
department
of
interior
as
the
statement
of
their
position
down
through
the
years.
you
would
have
noted
mr.
justice
black
that
it
refers
to
an
act
relating
to
phosphates.
prior
to
the
admission
of
alaska
and
of
the
union,
there
was
also
an
act
that
related
to
alaska
and
the
phosphate
act
and
the
alaska
act
provide
in
substance,
that
if
assessment
work
were
not
done,
then
the
claims
were
forfeited
to
the
federal
government
from
which
we
argue
of
course
that
when
congress
intended
to
cause
a
forfeiture
for
assessment
work.
it
said
so
as
it
did
in
the
alaska
act
which
became
obsolete
when
alaska
had
been
a
state
and
it
has
in
the
phosphate
act
which
is
recognized
by
the
department
to
be
an
exemption
to
this
general
doctrine.
that
the
federal
government
has
no
concern
or
responsibility,
or
rights
in
respect
to
assessment
work
and
that
leads
to
one
final
point
and
that
is
the
suggestion
was
made
this
morning
that
it
would
be
in
some
way
unconstitutional
for
the
congress
to
make
any
change
affecting
the
assessment
work
on
claims
that
are
already
vested.
we
submit
that
as
to
law
called
the
multiple
mineral
development
act
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
in
which
congress
did
precisely
that.
the
congress
provided
there
that
as
to
minerals
that
are
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act.
that
is
there
are
claims
that
are
covered
to
the
mineral
leasing
act.
anyone
could
go
in
and
locate
on
top
of
those
claims.
if
no
assessment
work
had
been
done,
so
long
as
they
were
locating
for
a
non-mineral
leasing
act
mineral.
for
example,
gold
is
not
a
mineral
leasing
act
mineral.
tomorrow,
if
the
claimants
involved
in
this
case
had
not
as
they
are
doing,
had
not
been
doing
their
assessment
work.
they’re
dong
it
because
of
this
very
statute
that
i’m
discussing.
if
they
had
not
been
doing
their
assessment
work,
tomorrow,
the
prospector
could
go
out
and
he
if
he
found
gold
there,
he
could
locate
that
claim
for
gold.
likewise
with
uranium
may
very
well
be
the
record
is
not
clear
that
much
of
your
--
that
some
of
the
uranium
that
was
discovered,
it
was
discovered
on
these
claims
which
were
subject
to
the
mineral
leasing
act
but
as
to
which
assessment
work
had
not
been
done.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
which
one
sir?
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
if
he’d
abandon
sir,
he
couldn’t.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
if
he
had
abandoned
it
and
he
could
not.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
but
with
due
respect,
the
use
of
the
word
duty,
it
sends
back
the
question
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully
because
the
duty
was
that
congress,
the
way
congress
said
the
duty
would
be
enforced
we
submit,
was
by
competition
between
rival
claimants.
i
suppose
the
real
problem
was
how
to
get
rid
of
the
large
part
of
the
two
billion
acres
of
land
that
the
government
found
itself
only.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir,
but
they
did
not
make
it
a
requirement
in
the
law.
that
in
order
to
keep
it,
a
man
had
to
do
the
assessment
work.
they
didn’t
make
it
a
requirement
at
the
law
that
he
had
to
discover
a
valuable
mineral.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
suppose
that
if
the
land
be
taxable
and
the
man
hadn’t
paid
taxes.
that
if
he
demonstrated,
that
he
had
never
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
doing
anything
about
it.
that
he
had
never
referred
to
it.
that
he
hadn’t
deviced
it
in
his
will,
but
he
had
had
ranch
land.
he’d
made
provision
for
the
disposition
of
his
ranch
among
his
family.
and
he’d
ignore
this
land
that
one
would
built
up
the
case
along
those
lines
depending
upon
the
actual
circumstances.
i
should
of
course
point
out
that
abandonment
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
department
has
not
challenged
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
would
suppose
that
if
he’d
completely
ignored
it
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
taken
positive
action
to
deal
with
analogous
property
and
he’d
done
nothing
with
this
if
that
would
be
a
basis
to
argue
to
the
finders
of
fact
that
the
man
had
intended
to
abandon
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oh
no
sir,
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
the
government
in
these
very
cases
should
you
hold
as
we
urge,
you
should
hold,
that
they
can’t
challenge
them
for
failure
to
assessment
work.
we
would
then
have
to
go
back
to
the
department
of
interior
and
apply
for
a
patent
and
then
when
these
very
claims
came
up,
the
department
could
say,
“these
claims
are
invalid.
we
will
not
give
you
a
patent
because
in
fact
you
have
abandoned
them.”
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely,
in
these
very
cases.
even
if
we
figure
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
sir.
yes
sir.
you
have
to
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir.
they
can
decline
to
get
a
patent
on
the
ground
that
has
been
abandoned.
upon
the
ground
that
there
is
no
discovery
--
has
been
no
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral
upon
the
ground
that
it
was
fraudulently
located
or
upon
the
ground
that
it’s
been
worked
out.
so
that
is
no
longer
a
valuable
for
mineral.
so
the
public
interest
can
be
protected
in
the
case
on
the
record.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
--yes
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
it
was.
they
have
been
condemned.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
if
the
assessment
work
had
not
been
done.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
i
didn’t
make
myself
clear.
my
position
here
is
that
the
assessment
work
is
vital
to
maintain
the
possessory
interest.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
as
against
the
other
locators.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
it
cannot
do
it
unless
it
condemns
and
it
pays
for
and
then
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
multiple
mineral
development
act
of
1954
was
passed
to
permit
people
to
come
on
these
oil
shale
claims
and
locate
them,
not
the
government.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
other
locators
to
locate
them
for
non-mineral
leasing
act
minerals.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
he
would
oust.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
just
as
though
the
mineral
leasing
act
had
never
been
passed.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oil,
gas,
sodium,
oil
shale.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
oil,
gas
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
well,
the
gold
for
example
is
not
covered.
uranium
is
not
covered.
aluminum
is
not
covered.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
because
under
the
statute,
the
new
locator
would
be
locating
ex
hypothesi
on
a
claim
where
there
had
been
no
--
where
there
had
been
a
failure
to
assessment
work.
so
that
claim
then
was
subject
to
location
so
that
the
man
who
discovered
gold
could
come
in
and
get
the
claim
not
just
for
gold
but
for
everything.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
it
was
just
as
the
same
situation
that
existed
as
to
all
of
these
claims
before
1920.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
that’s
right.
he
would
indeed.
and
then
in
turn
if
he
didn’t
do
assessment
work
and
somebody
came
along
and
wanted
for
uranium,
they
could
oust
him.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
state
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
because
they
are
between
private
claimants
presumably
because
of
the
policy
of
keeping
the
cases
originally
in
the
state
courts
where
the
fact
went
out.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
you
are
making
us
question,
yes
sir
i
am.
i
only
wanted
one
point
to
touch
on
and
that
is,
between
1935
and
1961,
that
is
to
say,
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
virginia-carolina
case,
the
department
of
interior
and
we
submit
that
the
evidences
is
uncontradicted
the
uncontradictable
administered
these
lands
as
it
stated
time
and
time
again
upon
the
principle,
that
the
old
assessment
work
decisions
were
invalid,
void,
and
have
no
effect.
as
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
government’s
response
to
our
interrogatories
in
which
they
said
they
had
no
evidence
that
any
government
official
had
ever
taken
any
act
or
had
done
anything
on
the
assumption
that
these
claims
were
in
any
way
tinged
within
validity
because
of
the
old
assessment
work
decisions.
furthermore,
we
described
in
detail
in
our
brief
the
circumstances
that
show
that
the
existence
of
these
claims
did
not
in
any
way
impair
the
use
of
land
for
public
parks.
the
use
of
it
for
reservoirs
or
for
any
other
purpose,
because
these
claims
just
like
any
other
claims
are
always
generally
accepted.
whenever
there
is
a
reservation
of
government
land.
the
government
says,
“this
reservation
shall
apply
only
to
the
public
land
that
is
not
encumbered
by
claims”
now
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
is
no
way
for
the
government
to
know
what
land
has
claims
or
not
unless
he
goes
out
and
searches
the
local
county
offices.
so
that
the
practice
is
always
been,
whenever
a
grant
is
made
of
public
lands
for
any
of
the
purposes,
they
are
discussed
in
the
government’s
brief
to
contain
a
reservation.
for
example
in
1916,
oil
shale
as
it
refers
tend
to
be
valuable
minerals.
the
geological
survey
said,
we
do
not
want
them
reserved
because
we
want
to
keep
them
open
for
location
and
grant
because
we
want
to
have
these
possesses
developed
to
get
the
shale
out.
the
navy
wanted
a
reservation
of
oil
shale
land.
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
reservation
would
not
cover
claims.
they
ask
and
got
a
reservation
of
twice
as
much
land
as
they
thought
they
needed
because
they
anticipated
that
about
half
of
them
would
be
covered
with
claims.
that
is
our
response
spelled
out
in
our
brief
to
the
government's
contention
that
the
existence
of
these
claims
in
any
way
has
interfered
with
the
operation
of
these
public
lands.
these
claims
haven’t
done
it
anymore
than
any
other
claims
such
as
claims
uranium
etcetera
that
are
not
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
government
--
if
the
government
goes
out
and
finds
a
man
on
government
property
and
they
say
he
has
no
right
to
it,
they
can
--
he’s
a
trespasser
and
they
can
evict
him,
then
if
he
wants
to
litigate
presumably,
he
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
some
place
because
he’s
claiming
they’re
taking
his
property.
and
then
they
can
litigate
out
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
infact
abandoned
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir,
because
they
cannot
evict
him
for
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
they
can
evict
him.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
sir?
he's
abandoned.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
but
the
language,
that
is
correct
sir.
but
mr.
justice
black,
i
submit
that
the
language
in
the
virginia-colorado
case
speaks
only
the
question
of
the
assessment
work.
it
doesn’t
talk
about
other
ways
of
maintaining
a
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
and
he
gets
no
right
unless
he
has
discovered
valuable
minerals
in
series
of
companion
cases
we’re
litigating
that
with
the
government
now.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
absolutely
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
once
you
have
a
valid
claim,
then
you
have
to
do
$500.00
worth
of
work.
you
can
do
it
in
one
year
or
40
and
then
you
file
an
application
for
a
patent.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no
sir.
you
have
to
have
discovered.
you
file
an
application
for
a
patent
and
you
allege
that
you
have
a
valid
claim
and
that
you
have
made
a
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral.
then
the
department
of
interior
people
send
people
out
as
they
did
on
this
penelope
baron’s
case
three
times
and
found
she
had
a
valid
claim.
they’d
look
at
it
if
the
inspector
thinks
it’s
been
abandoned,
he
writes
a
report
and
they
don’t
grant
the
patent.
he
acquires
in
the
community.
he
says,
“who
owns
this
thing
or
they
are
done
about
it”
if
the
mineral
showing
is
not
sufficient
to
constitute,
the
discovery
of
a
valuable
mineral,
he
writes
a
report
and
recommends
against
it.
and
then
the
patent
claim
is
rejected.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
right.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir
and
since
about
1927,
it
can
go
forward
and
do
it
on
its
motion.
in
other
words,
if
it
wants
to
build
a
dam,
i
think
there’s
a
lot
of
a
valueless
claim
out
there.
it
confined
the
claimants,
make
publication,
and
clear
this
land
of
claims.
and
if
they
don’t
come
in
and
defend
it,
which
i
suppose
in
practical
matters
one
of
the
ways
on
abandonment
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
and
they’d
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
to
the
land,
all
of
it.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
however,
many
acres
are
covered
by
claims
sir.
in
this
case,
here
for
example,
what
happened
was
that
there
were
18
claims
pending
under
the
department
of
interior,
18
applications
for
patents
covering
about
250
claims
of
160
acres
each
so
that
that’s
about
35,000
acres.
and
what
happened
was
that
the
solicitor
of
interior
issued
instructions
to
the
field
office
to
reject
these
applications
upon
the
ground
that
these
old
assessment
work
decisions
were
res
judicata.
he
did
so.
then
the
solicitor
took
--
there
was
no
notice
to
anybody
about
this.
no
operative
will
be
heard,
nothing.
then
the
solicitor
took
the
cases
up,
reviewed
them
on
appeal
and
confirmed
his
original
instruction
in
a
decision
called
the
union
oil
case
which
is
the
one
which
is
involved
here.
in
which
he
conceded
that
the
--
there
was
a
right
of
appeal
in
1935
to
the
courts
but
he
held
that
there
had
been
latches.
the
trial
in
the
court
below
was
solely
on
the
question
of
latches
because
we
introduced
voluminous
evidence
all
from
the
government
files
to
show
this
unbroken
conduct
where
they
had
recognized
the
validity
of
these
claims.
in
our
briefs,
we
have
set
forth
the
number
of
acres
that
were
patented
on
page
40
in
a
map.
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
land
has
been
patented
in
colorado
and
it’s
the
big
part
of
the
land
that’s
been
patented
for
oil
share
was
covered
by
these
decisions.
so
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
disputable
that
there
is
no
latches.
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
latches,
they
said
there's
been
a
dearth
of
any
evidence
and
the
tenth
circuit
confirmed
that.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i
see.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
they
have
a
hearing
in
the
department.
they
have
a
hearing
within
the
department
of
interior.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
then,
he
can
appeal
either
to
the
land
office
or
what
is
usually
the
practice
in
large
cases
for
the
secretary
of
interior
to
hear
the
appeal
himself
or
have
it
heard
by
someone
to
whom
he
delegates
it.
and
within
the
last
year
there
has
been
set
up
in
the
department,
an
appeals
board
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
appeals
from
mineral
examiners.
after
the
hearing
there
is
a
record
made
before
the
examiner.
then
you
can
go
up
intermediately
to
the
head
of
the
land
office
or
as
its
usually
done
in
large
cases,
directly
to
the
secretary
who
up
until
a
year
ago
had
the
matter
decided
by
the
solicitor,
that’s
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
same
gentleman
who
gave
these
instructions
then
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
union
oil
case.
now
the
secretary
has
set
up
an
appeals
board,
then
you
go
the
appeals
board,
then
it
is
reviewed
by
the
courts.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
no,
the
federal
courts,
that’s
right
sir.
then
it
goes
to
the
federal
courts.
now
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
right
sir.
or,
since
recent
years
where
this
court
has
sustained
the
right
of
the
interior
to
attack
patents
at
its
own
initiative,
originally
that
was
not
clear.
now,
they
can
go
out
and
challenge
claims
and
force
the
claimant
to
come
in
and
defend
his
claim.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
not
waiting
for
him
to
assert
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
right.
yes
sir.
they
dealt
with
those
of
the
things.
now
i
come
sir
to
your
question
on
maintenance,
to
maintain.
we
think
the
background
that
is
not
uncomplicated
but
we
believe
it’s
clear.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
the
background
of
it
is
this
briefly.
if
you
recall
that
the
mining
laws
that
i
have
described
which
there
was
a
direct
grant
of
a
claim
went
back
primarily
what's
called
--
so-called
hardrock
metals,
they
came
out
of
the
gold
rush
to
california
and
a
hardrock
minerals
unlike
petroleum
and
natural
gas
are
found
characteristically
either
in
loads
in
which
you
have
a
vain
which
under
our
law
as
you
know
you
can
follow
wherever
the
gold
goes
or
there
are
placer
claims
like
those
out
in
the
open
where
you
--
like
gold
in
a
river
bed.
in
the
‘90’s,
the
last
session,
the
question
came
up
as
to
which
one
of
this
categories,
oil
and
gas
fitted
in.
the
interior
said
first
it
is
patentable
as
a
placer,
then
the
interior,
the
secretary
said
he
didn’t
think
it
was
then
he
finally
said
he
thought
oil
and
gas
was
and
finally
congress
confirmed
that
by
saying
that
oil
and
gas
was
patentable
as
a
placer.
then
the
question
arose
because
in
1909,
oil
and
gas
were
going
to
be
withdrawn
from
further
location
and
the
interior
in
connection
with
various
withdrawals
that
it
had
made,
had
decided
that
if
a
man
was
looking
for
oil
or
gas
and
was
drilling
and
hadn’t
hit
it
but
was
still
looking,
it
was
unfair
to
cut
him
off
even
though
he
hadn’t
made
a
discovery.
so
they
established
the
administrative
rule
that
when
–
in
connection
with
oil
and
gas,
there
was
a
withdrawal
and
a
prospect,
he
was
looking.
so
long
as
he
went
right
ahead
and
kept
looking,
if
he
found
it
and
made
a
discovery,
he
got
the
claim
even
though
as
a
technical
matter
under
the
mining
laws,
no
claim
vested
until
the
discovery.
so
this
was
a
kind
of
a
special
or
quasi
or
in-court
claim.
now,
when
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
passed,
this
question
arose
in
the
congress
because
they
said,
the
interior
said,
“what
are
we
going
to
do
about
these
different
kind
of
claims
that
aren't
real
claims
because
no
discovery
has
happened?”
so
they
put
in
this
provision
that
so
long
as
the
oil
or
gas
matter
was
directed,
maintained
the
claim
by
going
forward
to
seek
discovery,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
claim
even
though
at
the
time
the
act
vested,
he
had
not
a
claim
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word.
and
the
papers
that
are
set
forth
in
the
government’s
amended
reply
brief,
we
submit
make
perfectly
clear
that
what
mr.
vogelsang
was
saying
to
people
on
the
hill
was,
if
this
law
goes
through
without
some
kind
of
a
saving
clause,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
this
oil
and
gas
leases?
the
last
sentence
in
the
last
--
one
of
those
letters,
last
letter,
we
think
makes
that
clear.
mr.
senate
who
was
a
congressman
in
responding
to
mr.
vogelsang
said,
“i
do
not
know
that
i
just
understand
your
reference
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
two
to
the
$100.00
work
of
a
labor
or
assessment
work.
do
you
have
in
mind
assessment
work
under
the
state
laws
or
under
the
federal
statutes?
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
federal
state
assessment
work,
work
is
required
only
after
discovery,
the
point
being
that
you
didn’t
have
any
claim
in
an
oil
shale
situation
until
you
had
discovery.”
so
that
when
we
come
against
that
background,
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
krushnic
and
in
virginia-colorado,
we
submit
that
it’s
clear
that
what
the
court
was
saying
there
was
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
matter
in
the
second
case.
the
interior
department
only
has
jurisdiction
to
do
these
various
things
with
respect
to
abandonment
of
discovery
because
they
have
a
duty
to
issue
the
patent.
justice
brandeis
in
the
very
clear
and
recent
decisions,
its
quoted
in
our
brief
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
department
originally
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all.
there's
no
statute
that
gives
the
department
of
interior
jurisdiction
to
hold
or
contest
proceedings
to
do
any
of
these
things.
as
he
points
out
there,
the
department
has
jurisdiction
only
where
and
i
think
i
should
perhaps
refer
to
his
specific
language,
only
what
he
said
was,
“jurisdiction
is
conferred
upon
the
secretary
giving
him
the
power
to
make
all
determinations
of
all
as
well
as
fact
which
are
essential
to
the
performance
of
the
duties
specifically
imposed
and
we
submit
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
was
saying
in
virginia-colorado,
there
is
no
duty
specifically
imposed
with
respect
to
assessment
work.
it
is
only
imposed
with
respect
to
granting
of
the
patent.
you
don’t
have
to
do
assessment
work
to
get
a
patent.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
i’m
reading
sir
from
mr.
justice
brandeis’
decision
in
west,
278
us
20.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
on
the
basis
of
that
analysis
that
the
two
things:
one;
that
the
virginia-carolina
case
was
the
case
of
jurisdiction
and
also
that
it
was
a
case
that
was
rightly
decided
of
jurisdiction
so
that
if
it
were
up
new,
it
would
be
decided,
should
be
decided
the
same
way.
thank
you.
mr.
fowler
hamilton
may
i
just
make
one
comment
--
mr.
fowler
hamilton
in
connection
with
maintenance,
i
have
given
you
our
view
of
the
genesis
of
the
phrase,
“to
maintain.”
we
think
that
when
chief
justice
hughes
was
discussing
in
the
latter
paragraph
in
which
he
said
a
claim
could
be
maintained
by
doing
assessment
work.
he
was
answering
in
effect
to
a
rhetorical
question
that
would
have
been
to
put
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
argument
in
the
brief
so
that
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
definition,
a
claim
can
be
maintained
against
other
people
an
relocators
by
doing
assessment
work.
it
can
be
maintained
against
the
government
by
not
abandoning
it.
it
can
be
maintained
against
the
government.
in
other
words,
by
doing
all
of
those
things
that
are
necessary
to
qualify
you
for
a
patent.
thank
you
sir.
