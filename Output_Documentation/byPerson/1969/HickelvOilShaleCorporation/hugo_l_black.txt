black
that
law
was
passed
in
1870?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understand
is
that
if
a
man
went
out
under
1870
act,
1871
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
stated
the
place
and
he
finds
him
guilty.
that
was
his
of
course
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
nothing
could
be
done
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned
--
the
government
said
it
was
known
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
remained
that
way
until
some
other
man
would
come
in
and
some
competitor,
in
the
exportation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
assert
his
claim
and
take
it
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
objective
of
the
statement
in
the
bill
and
the
requirements
in
the
bill
as
certain
things
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
assessment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
only
to
protect
other
people
who
wanted
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
about
what
the
old
case
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
that
point
at
least
the
assessment
requirement
or
a
failure
to
perform
the
assessment
work
had
nothing
what
ever
to
do
with
your
submission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
his
right
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
between
him
and
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
from
which
you
are
reading?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
putted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
rather
strange
law
at
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
a
man
could
stake
all,
put
stake
on
a
mining
on
1871,
do
nothing
else
and
then
come
in
and
claim
title
for
that
land
in
1970.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
he
would
have
abandoned
it,
he
just
had
to
develop.
it
was
in
the
duty
on
his
part
to
develop
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
like
your
argument
blues
is
a
part
of
its
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that
they
want
to
get
rid
of
it,
by
people
who
were
developing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
from
you
that
the
argument,
i
mean
by
means
of
the
cases
have
been
decided.
you
would
say
the
government
has
no
right
to
challenge
the
fact
that
he
is
offended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
on
your
judgment,
the
government
does
has
--
have
a
remedy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
in
any
cases
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
can
decline
to
give
a
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
will
not
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
hamilton,
may
i
ask
getting
back,
i
think
you
had
said
this
morning
that
all
that
one
who
located
one
of
these
claims
back
in
1870,
acquired
that
was
a
possessory
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
subject
to
condemnation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
you
say,
you
thought
that
congress
could
do
as
--
and
he
get
told
us
the
issue
was
in
1951?
permit
someone,
go
locate
on
top
of
an
existing
possessory
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
premise
that
the
assessment
work
is
unrelated
to
the
possessory
interest
that’s
acquired
because
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
against
someone
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
but
i’m
--
as
against
the
government
however,
it
isn’t
necessary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
how
can
the
government
locate
something
on
top
of
a
possessory
interest
which
is
valid
as
against
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
you
told
us
it
was
a
1951
statute
which
permitted
or
if
you
locate
on
top
of
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
one
did,
he
would
oust.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
original
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
everything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
going
to
get
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
my
hypothetically
claimant
in
1871.
suppose
he
were
to
get
in
a
controversy
with
the
government
or
government
claimed
to
have
a
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
1969?
could
the
government
sue
him,
say
he
had
abandoned
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
sue
him
and
take
a
demand.
so
there
is
that
much
interest
in
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
some
of
the
language
then
in
the
colorado-virginia
case
are
little
too
broad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
the
assessment
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
hasn’t
developed
it.
he
has
abandoned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that’s
the
other
side
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
still
remains
a
duty
on
his
part
not
to
abandon
it
which
the
government
can
enforce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
a
right
of
its
own.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
limit,
virginia-carolina
--
virginia-colorado
holding
to
the
question
of
assessment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
is
the
right
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
or
not
you
discovered
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
can
confess
that
far
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
say
that
you
didn’t
comply
with
act
and
paid
$500.00
or
to
make
the
discovery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore
you
do
not
own
the
land
and
never
asked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
perhaps
that
i
--
i
gather
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
patent
gives
a
free
sample?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
20,
you
have
told
us
earlier,
this
thing
all
started
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
would
be
a
controversy
arising
out
of
an
application
for
a
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
came
in
in
the
1920
act
that
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
case
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
suggesting
this?
and
that
there's
no
valid
claim
that
if
--
before
1920,
the
assessment
work
had
not
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
maintained
it,
in
what
sense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
to
confess,
i’m
a
little
lost.
i
thought
the
basic
premise
of
your
case
was
that
the
--
a
condition
to
retaining
a
possessory
interest
clause
that
could
continue
to
do
the
assessment
work
required
by
the
statute,
am
i
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course
to
that
argument,
when
i
look
at
the
ickes
against
the
development
corporation,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
said,
that
was
as
far
to
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior
by
appropriate
proceedings
to
determine
that
a
claim
was
invalid
for
lack
of
discovery
or
fraud
or
other
defects
or
that
it
was
subject
to
cancellation
by
reason
of
abandonment,
so
that
i
would
suppose
that
maybe
your
only
objection
to
this
case,
i
may
be
wrong,
would
be
that
the
government
has
all
the
remedies
it
would
have,
it
has
the
title,
it
has
not
passed
from
--
so
that
if
a
person
owns
it
to
the
internal
exclusion
of
the
government.
but
that
the
government
can
proceed
and
that
i
would
suppose
that
failure
to
asses
would
--
and
even
now,
i
think
it
could
be
held
and
should
be
held
that
the
failure
to
asses
was
evidence
pointing
in
the
direction
of
abandonment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
might
agree
with
them
as
you
gave
no
ground
to
forfeiture.
it
is
still
not
saying
that
it
didn’t
--
it
wasn’t
some
evidence
that
they
had
abandoned
their
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
language
might
be
explained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
two
sentences
before
that.
the
introduction
of
that
discussion
is
a
sentence
--
there
is
no
ground
for
a
charge
of
abandonment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
isn’t
that
connected
with
the
later
sentence,
the
plaintiff
had
no
lost
no
rights
but
fairly
to
do
the
annual
assessment
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
law
was
passed
in
1870?
justice

what

that
i
would
suppose
that
maybe
your
only
objection
to
this
case,
i
may
be
wrong,
would
be
that
the
government
has
all
the
remedies
it
would
have,
it
has
the
title,
it
has
not
passed
from
--
so
that
if
a
person
owns
it
to
the
internal
exclusion
of
the
government.
but
that
the
government
can
proceed
and
that
i
would
suppose
that
failure
to
asses
would
--
and
even
now,
i
think
it
could
be
held
and
should
be
held
that
the
failure
to
asses
was
evidence
pointing
in
the
direction
of
abandonment.
justice

l.

yes.
justice

and
one
might
agree
with
them
as
you
gave
no
ground
to
forfeiture.
it
is
still
not
saying
that
it
didn’t
--
it
wasn’t
some
evidence
that
they
had
abandoned
their
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
language
might
be
explained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
two
sentences
before
that.
the
introduction
of
that
discussion
is
a
sentence
--
there
is
no
ground
for
a
charge
of
abandonment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
isn’t
that
connected
with
the
later
sentence,
the
plaintiff
had
no
lost
no
rights
but
fairly
to
do
the
annual
assessment
work.
