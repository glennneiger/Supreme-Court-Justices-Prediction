can
maintenance
be
carried
out
only
by
assessment?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
occupancy
and
continued
prospecting
would
not
be
equivalent
to
maintenance?
justice
potter
stewart
what
maintenance
and
assessment
of
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
that
in
the
history
of
this
where
actually
some
claims
were
patented
even
though
they
had
previously
been
--
the
claims
had
previously
been
canceled
for
one
of
assessment
work?
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
held
circumstances
that
they’re
only
in
validity
to
the
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
passed
as
reference
to
this
court’s
--
i
mean
open,
connection
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
virginia-colorado
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
it
an
effort
to
undo
what
the
decision
had
done?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
this
case
should
be
overruled,
would
effect
would
it
have
on
people
going
the
same
position
as
so
you
owned
the
land
here.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
strauss.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
looking
at
the
virginia-colorado
again,
that
opinion
relies
rather
heavily
on
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
wouldn’t
be
enough
for
you,
would
it?
just
to
overrule
virginia-colorado
which
you
also
want
krushnic
overruled?
that’s
the
flat
one
at
least
that
was
read
in
virginia-colorado
that
plaintiff
had
lost
no
rights
but
failure
to
do
the
annual
assessment
work.
that
failure
gave
the
government
no
ground
of
forfeiture,
signing
krushnic.
justice
potter
stewart
all
i’m
saying
is
that
this
court
seems
to
be
--
if
it
read
it
that
way
in
virginia
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
there
a
word
that
thereafter
maintained
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
evidence
of
actual
assessment
that
was
prospective
to
claim
that
one
dug
holes
and
one
built
something?
what
was
the
actual
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
history
of
the
word
assessment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state
was
nothing
more
than
a
possessory.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
lands
were
federal
lands?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
see
and
i
suppose
they
could
also
go
into
a
court
in
an
action
for
ejectment
or
quiet
title
or
--?
