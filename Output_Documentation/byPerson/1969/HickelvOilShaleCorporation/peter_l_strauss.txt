mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
surely
will.[pause]
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
is
a
rather
complex
case,
it
might
be
useful
at
the
outset
to
state
a
very
brief
outline
form
how
i
expect
to
proceed.
as
the
court
knows,
the
case
principally
involves
section
37
of
the
leasing
act
of
1927
which
provides
for
the
patenting
of
certain
mining
claims
to
federal
land
which
were
valid
in
1920
and
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
were
thereafter
maintained
in
accordance
with
the
prior
law.
so
after
the
statement,
i
mean
first
to
examine
the
history
of
the
law
statements
regarding
the
maintenance
of
the
mining
claims
in
the
public
domain
and
i
do
that
in
full
consciousness
of
the
difficulties
which
the
solicitor
general
just
spoke
of
about
lawyer's
history
but
nonetheless
feeling
it
is
necessary
to
reexamine
that.
then
i
mean
to
cast
a
critical
eye
of
this
court's
decision
in
ickes
versus
virginia-colorado
development
corporation
which
is
the
other
focus
of
this
case
not
necessarily
to
procure
its
overruling
although
we
think
and
desire
that
it
should
be
overruled
but
is
a
means
of
making
clear
at
least
the
reasons
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
hope
we
can,
yes.
as
a
means
of
making
clear
the
reasons
at
least
why
we
feel
it
must
be
limited
to
its
particular
facts
and
that
i
hope
then
leads
naturally
to
the
questions
of
review
which
are
also
present
in
the
case.
this
case
is
part
of
a
battle
over
ownership
rights
to
several
hundred
thousands
of
acres
of
land
in
colorado
and
larger
amounts
in
utah
and
wyoming.
all
of
this
land
contains
a
rock
called
oil
shale
from
which
oil
can
be
distilled
at
a
high
temperature
and
no
one
knows
quite
how
much
oil
is
there
or
will
ever
be
recovered,
but
the
amounts
are
huge
and
i
think
there
will
be
agreement
that
it
represents
at
least
a
century
of
this
nation's
present
rate
of
consumption.
the
oil
shale
which
is
already
in
private
hands
represents
about
a
decade
of
that
century
or
perhaps
more
at
--
and
is
at
present
technically
the
most
feasible
portion.
the
oil
shale
over
which
owner
should
the
ownership
dispute
involve
in
this
case
is
raging
represents
a
similar
period
and
is
also
in
the
technically
accessible
portion
of
the
shale.
the
dispute
generally
is
whether
(inaudible)
in
the
technically
assessable
portion
of
the
shale
that
the
depth
of
which
the
shale
is
buried
under
the
overburden
varies
from
place
to
place
and
private
claims
tend
to
be
in
the
area
where
it’s
most
accessible.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
approximately.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
some
disputes
--
i
think
it's
efficient
to
say
it
involves
ten
years
worth
of
oil
consumption.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
out
of
a
hundred
or
more.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
that's
clear
that
it
exists
throughout
but
it
is
most
accessible
to
present
method
of
mining.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
one
is
yet
mining
although
the
oil
shale
corporation
certainly
has
plans
in
that
regard.
the
dispute
generally
is
whether
persons
who
made
claims
to
oil
shale
lands
before
the
lands
were
withdrawn
from
the
possibility
of
claim
in
1920
had
any
obligation
to
develop
their
claims
after
that
time
or
could
simply
hold
them
in
speculation
for
indefinite
periods
of
time
without
an
obligation
of
maintenance.
if
the
federal
government
has
clear
title
to
the
lands,
then
it
will
be
able
to
sell
leases
to
persons
whom
on
condition
really
that
they
develop
it
and
it
will
be
able
to
collect
substantial
royalties
once
they
do.
if
it
must
sell
or
patent
the
lands
to
the
present
claimants
of
whom
respondents
here
are
only
representative,
it
must
recognize
rights
on
land
which
have
been
left
completely
undeveloped
for
33
years
and
for
which
there
would
be
no
guarantee
of
development
in
the
future
and
it
would
receive
only
$2.50
an
acre
as
its
total
price
and
there
are
also
obvious
differences
in
the
government's
ability
to
control
pollution,
water
use
and
other
environmental
factors
and
to
guide
a
rational
development
to
the
resource.
these
particular
cases
here
as
a
result
of
the
secretary's
refusal
in
1964
to
issue
certain
patents
to
oil
shale
lands
including
lands
held
by
three
of
the
respondents
here
or
groups
of
respondents
i
should
say,
those
represented
by
respondents
napier,
umpleby,
and
brown.
he
refused
those
patents
on
the
ground
that
the
claims
had
been
cancelled
in
1931
and
early
1932
an
administrative
proceedings
which
were
permitted
to
become
final
at
that
time.
it
is
clear
that
he
probably
would
also
have
refused
to
patent
the
claims
now
owned
by
the
oil
shale
corporation
which
represents
the
fourth
group
of
respondents,
if
those
claims
had
been
before
him.
since
those
claims
too
had
been
cancelled
in
default
proceedings
in
the
early
30s,
then
these
cancellations
were
part
of
a
concerted
effort
on
the
secretary’s
part
to
identify
and
cancel
claims
that
were
not
being
maintained
in
the
early
30s
when
evidence
was
conservatively
fresher
than
it
is
now.
we
said
that
history
out
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
the
first
three
sets
of
claimants
napier,
umpleby,
and
brown
sought
review
of
the
secretary's
1964
decision
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
and
there,
they
were
joined
by
the
oil
shale
corporation
seeking
declaratory
judgment.
although
respondents
heard
a
number
of
reasons
below
for
requiring
the
secretary
to
ignore
these
old
and
final
administrative
decisions
from
the
30s,
the
district
court
and
subsequently
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
considered
only
one
ground
which
was
that
the
administrative
decisions
have
been
beyond
the
secretary
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
therefore
could
be
given
no
effect.
and
they
relied
--
excuse
me.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
most
of
them
are,
your
honor
and
to
varying
degrees.
interested
that
the
--
interested
i
think
is
a
--
is
a
question
of
degree.
i
should
say
the
oil
shale
company
and
the
union
oil
company
are
the
only
two
which
have
--
which
i'm
aware
that
have
made
a
very
substantial
independent
step
towards
actual
development.
in
terms
of
land
holdings
of
the
hearings
before
the
subcommittee
on
antitrust
and
monopoly
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
are
cited
at
least
in
respondents’
brief
and
i
think
in
ours
as
well
contain
a
number
of
statements
in
that
regard.
and
i
think
i
have
some
here
in
any
event
varying
of
the
top
27
oil
companies
in
the
nation,
here
we
are
at
page
192
of
those
hearings
that
shows
holdings
of
patented
lands,
the
union
oil
company
has
50,000
acres
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
page
192
of
the
antitrust
hearings.
but
it's
not
present
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely.
it
shows
the
union
oil
company
is
holding
50,000
acres,
mobil
oil
company
34,000
acres,
tidewater
oil
22,000
acres
and
so
forth.
i
think
tosco
in
those
hearings,
the
oil
shale
company
in
those
hearings
has
stated
that
it
owns
at
present
sufficient
land
to
produce
200,000
barrels
of
oil
daily
for
25
years
or
more.
and
most
of
the
oil
companies
are
in
a
similar
kind
of
position.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
is
there
--
well,
i
think
the
information
could
be
obtained
that
place
on
page
192
of
those
hearings
gives
a
complete
listing
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
couldn't
say
whether
they
have
rights
in
any
of
the
disputed
lands
or
not
but
i
would
think
since
they
are
a
major
holder,
i
would
think
it
unlikely
that
they
did
not
have
disputes
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
parties
to
the
old
administrative
proceeding,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
would
be
one
step
along
the
way
towards
procuring
patents
for
the
union
oil
company.
it
would
not
require
the
issue
of
--
issuance
of
patents
but
it
certainly
would
remove
an
obstacle
to
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
decided
that
in
passing
on
certain
applications
to
purchase
public
lands
in
containing
oil
shale,
the
secretary
of
interior
must
ignore
administrative
actions
which
became
final
almost
40
years
ago.
actions
which
purported
to
cancel
the
claims
to
possession
on
which
the
applications
were
based.
if
the
clients
were
effectively
canceled,
there
could
be
no
right
to
purchase
these
lands
today.
for
50
years,
the
lands
have
been
available
to
new
claimants,
only
by
lease.
the
statute
which
made
that
change.
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
provided
however
that
existing
valid
claims
could
still
qualify
for
purchase
under
the
old
law.
only
if
the
clients
were,
and
“thereafter
maintained
in
compliance
with
the
laws
under
which
initiated.”
the
old
law
was
the
general
mining
act
of
1872
and
it
conferred
an
exclusive
possessory
right
on
persons
who
made
the
discovery
of
valuable
minerals
on
the
public
domain
and
then
performed
certain
technical
functions
on
the
land
and
at
the
local
county
courthouse.
that
claim
remained
valid
for
as
long
as
the
individual
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
united
states
law.
in
particular,
the
law
required
the
annual
performance
of
$100.00
worth
of
so
called
assessment
work
every
year.
that
requirement
is
the
only
one
under
the
law
that
might
be
thought
that
have
to
do
with
maintaining
a
claim
once
it
is
made.
in
terms,
the
statute
states
only
that
failure
to
do
the
work
opens
the
land
to
relocation
by
another
prospector.
but
in
my
argument,
i
shall
show
that
the
government
too,
often
re-acquired
possessory
rights
in
this
land.
during
the
1920’s,
the
secretary
discovered
that
assessment
work
was
not
being
done
on
a
vast
bulk
of
oil
shale
claims.
at
first,
he
sought
to
treat
any
failure
to
do
the
required
work
however
technical
as
automatically
canceling
the
claims
and
then
a
case
which
vividly
illustrated
the
resulting
inequities,
wilbur
versus
krushnic.
this
court
held
that
that
drastic
rule
is
improper.
it
left
open
however
the
possibility
that
claims
could
be
canceled
by
direct
government
action
during
a
period
while
assessment
work
at
last.
the
secretary
took
that
hint
and
during
the
following
three
years,
brought
actions
against
over
20,000
of
these
claims
covering
an
area
of
over
2,800,000
acres
in
colorado,
wyoming,
and
utah.
to
cancel
those
claims
for
failure
to
do
the
required
maintenance.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
secretary
was
prepared
to
show
that
the
assessment
work
was
not
being
done
up
to
the
very
moment
when
he
acted.
and
that
the
government
had
physically
inspected
and
posted
the
claims
in
reclaiming
them
much
as
a
private
individual
might
have
done.
many
claimants
did
not
even
respond
to
the
secretary’s
process,
not
include
75%
of
the
lands
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
other
claimants
responded
to
the
process
but
permitted
the
proceedings
against
them
to
become
final
at
the
administrative
level.
that’s
the
remainder
of
the
land
at
issue
in
this
case.
one
set
of
claimants
however,
had
been
doing
their
assessment
work
up
to
the
very
date
of
the
krushnic
decision,
and
promptly
offered
to
resume
doing
that
work.
that
case
came
to
this
court
as
ickes
versus
the
virginia-colorado
development
corporation.
and
the
court
decided
that
that
offer
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
claimants
were
maintaining
their
claims
as
the
statute
required.
in
its
opinion
at
page
646,
that
ask
how
could
the
valid
claims
of
the
plaintiff
be
thereafter
maintained
in
compliance
with
the
laws
under
which
initiated
manifestly
by
a
resumption
of
work.
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
resume
and
the
bill
alleged
that
plaintiff
had
made
arrangements
for
resumption
and
that
work
would
have
been
resumed
if
the
department
of
interior
had
not
intervened.
to
my
knowledge,
that
fully
distinguishes
all
the
claims
in
this
case.
now
respondents
will
probably
examine
the
subsequent
history
in
much
greater
detail.
but
let
me
say
this,
in
the
ensuing
25
years,
few,
if
any
persons
worked
the
claims
as
few
if
any
had
worked
then
since
1920.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
it.
while
the
secretary
did
state
following
virginia-colorado
on
the
basis
of
language
appearing
in
that
decision
that
he
felt
constrained
to
regard
his
prior
decisions
as
void.
there
were
very
few
claimants
who
sought
reopening
or
corresponded
within
regarding
this.
there
were
20,000
cancelled
claims.
in
the
first
ten
years
following
the
decision
in
virginia-colorado
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
five
private
claimants
wrote
to
the
secretary
inquiring
about
the
status
of
their
claims.
and
it
was
not
until
1950,
15
years
after
virginia-colorado
that
the
first
patent
involving
a
canceled
claim
was
issued
and
that
appears
from
exhibit
95,
plaintiff’s
exhibit
95
at
page
148
of
the
record.
from
that
year
until
1960,
patents
were
issued
on
only
74,000
acres
of
the
almost
3
million
acres
of
land
involved
in
these
cancellations.
in
1962,
in
the
administrative
proceedings
challenged
here,
the
secretary
decided
that
virginia-colorado
did
not
require
him
to
ignore
cancellations
which
had
become
final
before
that
case
was
decided.
of
respondent’s
numerous
contentions,
only
one
is
properly
here
that
virginia-colorado
held
that
the
administrative
cancellations
of
the
1930’s
were
alter
various
of
the
secretary’s
authority
and
hence
that
their
claims
survive
these
proceedings
unimpaired.
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
contention,
it
was
the
only
contention
those
court’s
passed.
it
held
that
the
old
cancellations
must
be
regarded
as
void.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
on
october
13th
of
last
year.
thus
we
find
ourself
in
the
situation
where
a
claim
to
an
exclusive
possessory
right,
that’s
the
claim,
it
is
granted
by
the
statute,
made
in
1919,
may
have
to
be
honored
today
even
though
for
30
or
40
years
the
claimants
may
never
have
set
foot
on
the
land.
it
is
the
united
states
which
in
fact
has
been
the
exclusive
possessor
of
these
premises
for
most
of
this
time
and
which
has
used
the
land
for
many
purposes,
this
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
43.
indeed,
the
government’s
effective
possession
of
these
lands
has
been
foreign
access
of
the
colorado
prescription
period
of
18
years
even
if
one
starts
to
count
in
1931,
or
1932,
when
it
asserted
its
right
to
proceed
in
these
proceedings.
the
significance
to
the
case
is
substantial.
when
congress
passed
the
mineral
leasing
act
in
1920,
it
shows
leasing
over
private
ownership
as
the
preferable
means
of
developing
government
land
including
these
minerals.
it
did
so
in
order
to
avoid
monopolization
and
the
sequestration
of
fuel
resources,
to
assure
a
commensurate
return
to
the
government
and
perhaps
particularly
important
today
to
promote
environmental
interests.
under
a
lease,
the
government
can
control
the
mode
of
production
far
more
effectively
than
if
this
land
were
in
private
ownership.
this
factor,
indeed
all
of
these
factors
remain
relevant
to
that.
the
mineral
leasing
act
as
i
said
before
did
provide
as
an
exception
that
claims
would
be
patented,
could
be
reduced
to
private
ownership,
if
they
had
been
maintained
under
the
prior
law.
but
again,
it’s
the
only
requirement
under
the
1872
act
that
had
anything
to
do
with
maintaining
a
location.
once
it
was
made,
once
the
technical
requirements
of
filing
the
location
had
been
followed
out
was
the
requirement
that
you
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
work
a
year
on
the
claim.
the
proponent
of
that
requirement
senator
cole
of
california
told
the
senate
in
1872
and
this
is
said
out
at
page
13
of
our
amended
reply
brief,
that
the
provision
was
intended
and
i
quote
“to
ensure
good
faith
in
the
working
of
the
mines,
to
prevent
there
being
held
by
owners
an
indefinite
length
of
time
without
working,
to
require
the
miner
to
use
a
little
diligence
or
exertion
in
the
working
of
its
mine
or
else
leave
it
subject
to
a
beneficial
use
by
some
other
party.”
of
course,
if
you
did
make
a
valuable
discovery
on
the
lands
you
would
want
to
do
that
work,
otherwise
somebody
come
in
and
take
it
away
it
from
you.
the
conceptual
framework
of
that
process
relocation
is
interesting.
as
it
shown
by
this
court’s
opinion
in
1005
in
volume
104
of
the
reports
which
is
cited
in
respondent’s
brief
at
page
10
and
which
was
a
principal
precedent
in
both
the
krushnic
and
the
virginia-colorado
decisions.
the
interest
which
the
relocator
acquired,
required
not
from
the
previous
possessor
but
from
the
united
states
which
had
to
receive
it
in
some
fashion
and
as
we
note
in
our
reply
at
page
14,
this
court
has
frequently
acquitted
failure
to
do
assessment
work
with
abandonment
of
the
claims.
to
this
extent,
the
remark
which
appears
in
the
virginia-colorado
decision,
that
failure
to
do
assessment
work
gives
the
government
no
ground
of
forfeiture
on
abandonment
grounds
as
plainly
incorrect.
it
may
have
been
correct
in
that
case
where
15
months
after
there
was
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work
the
claimants
came
forward
and
said,
“we’re
going
to
start
right
up
again”
but
it
certainly
was
not
correct
as
a
statement
of
general
law.
now
it
is
true
that
in
general,
the
maintenance
requirements
were
privately
enforced.
that
was
because
in
general,
the
united
states
had
no
need
for
this
land
but
there
are
cases
in
which
the
government
does
want
its
land.
it
may
want
to
create
a
national
park
or
an
irrigation
project.
and
in
cases
like
that,
there
was
an
established
body
of
law
set
out
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
52
to
the
effect
that
the
secretary
could
withdraw
the
land
from
further
location
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
assessment
work
was
not
done,
the
government
could
retrieve
the
land
for
its
own
use.
this
is
not
a
small
matter
either.
in
the
recent
construction
of
the
grand
canyon
dam,
there
were
over
7,000
of
these
old
claims
on
the
land
there.
the
claims
which
had
to
be
cleared
off
the
land
and
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
go
to
considerable
expense
because
this
court
had
said
in
virginia-colorado
that
it
could
place
no
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
claimants
of
those
lands
hadn’t
been
doing
and
recording
their
assessment
work
as
the
statute
requires
for
many
years
since.
as
i
say
the
secretary
did
rule
in
a
small
but
consistent
body
of
law
that
in
these
situations
where
the
government
had
a
special
use
for
land.
private
planes
would
remain
valid
only
as
long
as
they
were
maintained
and
then
they
would
revert
back
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
for
which
the
land
around
it
had
been
withdrawn.
sometimes
he
used
the
word
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
not
quite
sure
how
to
respond
to
that.
the
only
thing
in
the
prior
law
that
has
to
do
with
maintenance
is
the
requirement
of
assessment
work.
there
is
no
other
provision
of
the
prior
law
that
says
anything
about
continuing
to
work
the
claim.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
occupancy
in
continued
prospect,
at
least
the
continued
prospecting
part
of
it
might
very
well
be
considered
as
maintenance
or
assessment
work
as
the
court
is
aware
from
the
coleman
case.
there
have
been
many
situations
where
persons
have
taken
the
government’s
land
extensively
for
mineral
purposes
and
actually
wanted
it
for
a
seaside
resort
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
would
be
the
government’s
--
the
government’s
position
here
is
that
one
can
only
understand
the
provision
that
these
claims
had
to
be
maintained
as
referring
to
assessment
work
because
there
is
no
other
provision
of
the
prior
law
that
gave
any
notion
whatever
about
maintenance.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
beginning
in
1950,
somewhat,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
2%
of
the
total
amount
of
land
redone,
i
think
it
began
perhaps
almost
inadvertently.
people
in
the
denver
office
saw
these
things
coming
in.
they
saw
the
situation
in
which
the
lands
were
being
obtained
and
they
gradually
came
to
be
pressured.
the
pressure
on
washington
from
the
district,
well
this
is
a
terrible
thing
we’re
doing.
why
do
we
have
to
give
the
land
to
away
like
this?
and
then
in
these
kinds
of
circumstances
and
it
was
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
whether
there
is
a
6
year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
patents
and
that
6
years
has
long
since
passed.
and
unless
there
were
some
sort
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
something
of
that
sort
the
government
cannot
reopen.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
that
is
respondent’s
contention.
that’s
not
actually
what
he
said
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
opinion
on
which
they
rely
is
an
opinion
called
the
shale
oil
company
which
appears
in
the
volume
55
of
the
department’s
reports,
and
at
page
290
is
the
language
they’re
concerned
with.
they
say
the
say
the
above
mentioned
decision
and
instructions
involved
in
virginia-colorado
that
is.
i
hereby
recalled
and
vacated
two
other
specific
decisions
and
other
departmental
decisions
in
conflict
with
this
decision,
i
hereby
overruled
the
commission’s
decision
is
reversed
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
application.
and
there
did
follow
from
that,
we
can’t
deny
it.
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
the
secretary
used
the
words
like
void
in
talking
about
his
view
of
what
this
court
had
done.
but
i
think
it’s
well
established
in
the
law
that
on
the
state,
the
secretary
may
make
in
interpreting
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
i
would
say
as
well
of
this
court’s
holding.
that
he
may
make
a
legal
mistake
of
that
sort,
can
hardly
forfeit
for
all
time,
the
government’s
interest
in
the
land
involved.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
that’s
what
at
issue
in
this
case
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
that’s
right,
at
page
290.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
in
its
opinion
and
of
course
it
does
give
some
trouble
but
as
i
said
before,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
established
for
the
court
in
united
states
versus
california
and
united
states
versus
san
francisco,
that
even
where
there
may
have
been
substantial
investments
made
and
by
and
large,
that’s
not
the
case
in
these
proceedings.
individual
secretaries
by
mistakes
they
may
make
in
construing
the
law
simply
can’t
forfeit
the
government’s
right
in
the
public
lands.
we’re
dealing
with
3
million
acres
of
public
land
here.
today,
only
74,000
acres
of
that
land
has
been
reduced
to
patent.
the
first
of
those
patents
was
issued
in
1950
and
i
really
think
that
the
court
would
have
no
difficulty
in
dealing
with
that
situation.
as
i
was
saying,
sometimes
in
this
body
of
law
which
permitted
the
government
to
retrieve
land
which
it
needed
for
specific
purposes.
sometimes,
the
secretary
used
the
words
assessment
work.
sometimes
he
just
talks
about
maintaining
the
claim
and
respondent
say,
“well
therefore
those
opinions
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
assessment
work”
but
again,
the
only
provision
in
the
statute
which
in
any
way
relates
the
maintaining
of
claim
is
the
provision
for
assessment
work.
there
simply
is
nothing
else
in
the
statute
relevant
on
that
issue.
now,
in
our
view
the
leasing
act
is
just
like
a
withdrawal
for
a
national
park
or
a
fort.
it
reflects
the
congressional
judgment
about
how
the
public
lands
ought
to
be
used.
and
so,
in
our
view,
it
gives
the
government
the
same
right.
and
now,
the
significant
aspect
is
that
that
act
ended,
eliminated
the
possibility
that
some
private
individual
could
come
in
to
the
lands
that
were
affected
and
put
a
claim
on
them,
that
would
end
this
old
claims.
because
the
act
withdrew
not
only
the
minerals,
not
only
the
oil
shale
from
location,
it
withdrew
the
lands
themselves.
even
if
you
found
gold
or
copper
on
the
land,
you
could
get
it
only
by
lease.
as
we
show
in
our
amended
reply
brief
at
pages
9
to
10.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
four
ways
that
one
could
interpret
this
provision
of
the
1920
law.
first
one
could
say,
that
assessment
work
must
be
done
and
as
soon
as
it’s
not
done
for
any
period
of
time,
however
brief,
whether
or
not
the
government
finds
out
about
it
at
that
time,
the
land
is
automatically
retrieved
for
government’s
use.
that
is
what
this
court
rejected
in
wilbur
versus
krushnic
and
we
don’t
urge
it
today.
the
second
possibility
is
the
government’s
position
in
virginia-colorado.
that
the
secretary
could
act
as
a
private
relocator
could.
where
he
has
a
specific
need
for
the
land
where
it
is
been
withdrawn
for
particular
government
purpose.
he
may
go
on
and
if
he
finds
land
where
assessment
work
isn’t
being
done
at
that
time,
he
stakes
it,
brings
an
adversary
proceeding
to
cancel
the
claim.
the
third
possibility
is
what
we
think
this
court
said
in
virginia-colorado,
which
is
that
the
government
can
go
around
periodically
and
more
or
less
make
demands
on
the
holder
to
these
claims
to
come
forward.
that
was
what
the
claimants
in
virginia-colorado
did.
this
court
said
that
they
did
it
and
relied
on
there
having
done
it.
the
court
said,
they
wanted
to
resume
their
work.
they
would
have
resumed
their
work
if
the
government
hadn’t
been
there.
that
is
a
--
perhaps
a
very
fine
line
to
draw.
it
isn’t
fully
adequate
but
it’s
certainly
better
than
the
fourth
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
respondent’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
maintenance
at
all,
that
the
government
has
no
interest
in
whether
a
claimant
develops
this
land
or
not.
when
somebody
went
out
in
the
winter
of
1919
and
staked
30,000
acres
over
a
five
day
period,
that’s
perhaps
too
large
and
i
think
it
was
--
there
were
several
that
were
2,000,
3,000,
4,000
acres
over
that
period
of
time.
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
government’s
interest
in
the
oil
shale
on
that
land
and
there
is
simply
no
way
that
the
government
can
retrieve
it.
the
best
short
comment
i
know
on
that
position
was
offered
in
the
house
by
representative
taylor
in
colorado.
his
credentials
on
land
issues
are
impeccable
and
are
vouched
for
by
respondents
themselves.
they
made
these
remarks
after
virginia-colorado
was
decided
in
an
evident
disagreement
with
it.
he
said,
people
have
been
holding
it
--
that
is
the
oil
shale
lands
for
years
and
years
without
complying
that
the
law.
that
is
the
assessment
work
law,
and
without
being
entitled
to
it.
this
is
to
require
than
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
is
to
maintain
their
claims
or
else
let
the
land
revert
back.
respondents
make
section
37
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
was
at
the
time
talking
to
a
statute
that
was
before
the
house.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
disappeared.
that
is
to
say
it
was
not
finally
acted
upon.
there
was
no
voting
it
down,
but
it
didn’t
pass.
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard
if
i
may
that
i
think
congress
has
always
labored
in
this
area
under
a
substantial
difficulty
of
the
court’s
decision
in
virginia-colorado
in
a
sense
declared
property
rights.
congress
would
interfere
with
those
rights
if
indeed
those
were
the
rights
only
at
its
constitutional
parole.
and
in
any
event,
the
congress
could
hardly
do
anything
about
period
of
non-work
which
had
been
observed
prior
to
the
court’s
decision
in
virginia-colorado
from
1920
to
1933,
there’s
nothing
that
congress
could
have
done
to
revive
the
disuse
or
to
revive
the
government
proceedings
if
indeed
as
well
as
sometimes
felt
at
the
time
they
had
been
in
the
sense
voided
by
this
court’s
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief.
there
was
an
extraordinary,
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
bills.
there
is
a
rather
an
extraordinary
amount
of
care
about
their
prospectivity.
this
particular
bill
was
only
a
perspective
bill.
it
would
only
have
acted
for
the
future,
about
the
limitations
on
what
the
government
could
do.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
bill
has
said
that
in
the
future.
you
must
do
assessment
work
because
i
think
congress
felt
that
would
be
changing
the
conditions
of
the
property
ownership.
there
was
something
in
there
about
why
you
have
to
come
in
and
register
the
lands.
they
felt
they
could
go
that
far.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
in
substantial
part
it
is
mr.
justice
brennan,
we’ve
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
18,
a
number
of
remarks
by
congressman.
all
of
them
addressed
to
what
they
considered
to
be
the
error
of
this
court
in
that
case
and
expressing
surprise
that
the
way
it
had
interpreted
the
land
law,
and
i
think
you
will
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
bills
some
alarm
about
whether
congress,
could
the
congress
could
ever
said
it
right.
this
court
clearly
enough
could
do
so.
respondent’s
view
of
the
bill
makes
it
into
a
good
deal
more
than
a
savings
clause
because
in
their
view,
it
creates
an
indefeasible
possessory
right
in
public
land
regarding
which
they
have
no
effective
obligation
of
care,
or
maintenance,
or
development.
no
such
right
ever
existed
under
these
nations
mining
laws
and
respondents
can
point
to
no
statement
and
congress
or
elsewhere
suggesting
that
that
would
be
the
just
or
desirable
way
to
dispose
off
our
lands.
75%
of
the
lands
involved
in
this
case
would
never
work
on.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
from
1920
until
they
were
bought
in
1954
for
pennies
an
acre.
and
the
congress
would
provide
only
five
rent
free
years
of
listing
oil
shale
lands,
certainly
did
not
entertain
the
notion.
that
it
was
enabling
persons
simply
to
sit
on
existing
claims
for
decade
after
decade
without
investment
or
obligations
or
fear
of
loss.
the
entire
lack
of
justification,
either
illegal
or
equitable
for
that
position
demonstrates
the
fallacy
of
the
claim.
now
whether
or
not
this
court
would
overrule
virginia-colorado,
that
seems
indisputable
to
us
that
the
secretary
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
those
old
cancellation
proceedings
when
they
were
brought
and
to
those
which
became
final
before
virginia-colorado
was
decided
can
be
given
effect
today.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
would
certainly
prefer
that
it'd
be
overruled
in
the
sense
that
it
would
remove
what
has
been
a
substantial
incubus
on
the
administration
of
the
public
lands
and
would
permit
considerably
more
rational
approach
to
this
issue
of
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
in
particular,
i
think,
the
particular
language
which
i
find
the
most
unfortunate,
is
the
court’s
remark
in
the
opinion
that
failure
to
do
assessment
work
gave
no
ground
for
a
holding
of
abandonment
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
reads
as
if
it
were.
i
know
the
tenth
circuit
believes
that
it
is
and
the
other
district
judges
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
but
as
i
was
remarking
to
justice
burger
--
to
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
in
this
circumstance
because
it
is
involved
with
property.
because
the
fifth
amendment
inevitably
gets
in
when
you
start
changing
the
conditions
of
property,
really
that
statutory
holding
has
something
of
a
constitutional
pass
to
it
and
i
don’t
believe
you
can
[voice
overlap]
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
certainly
have.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
ordinarily
you
do
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
the
bill
had
passed,
it
would
have
provided
that
the
list
for
federal
registration
of
these
claims
and
i
don’t
--frankly
don’t
recall
what
the
remainder
of
the
bill
was.
one
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
in
the
legislative
history,
there
is
mentioned
of
that
decision
and
what
it
had
done.
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
as
i
have
explained,
congress
didn’t
feel
it
could
undo
the
decision.
it
felt
it
could
make
some
corrections
for
the
future
but
because
land
is
involved
here,
there
are
some
constitutional
inhibitions
about
congress
taking
it
away
by
statute.
that
this
court
had
made
a
mistake,
i
think
the
court
could
correct
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
number
of
effects.
first,
as
to
those
lands
which
have
already
been
patented,
which
have
already
been
sold
to
private
individuals,
i
should
think
that
be
no
effect.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
because
the
transaction
is
done
there,
it’s
a
six
year
statute
of
limitations
on
undoing
the
transactions,
six
years
has
passed.
second
as
to
the
period
before
the
decision
and
it’s
the
period
before
1935,
i
should
think
an
overruling
would
permit
the
government
to
rely
on
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work
at
that
time.
i
should
think
an
overruling
would
have
no
effect
on
what
was
done
to
the
land
between
the
date
of
this
court’s
decision
in
1935
and
the
date
of
its
decision
overruling
the
opinion.
but
certainly
the
opinion
was
there
and
one
can’t
deny
its
presence
in
that
sense.
a
more
difficult
question
would
arise
as
to
certain
claims.
there
are
claims
for
example,
the
(inaudible)
claims
and
the
oiler
claims
in
this
case
represent
about
a
thousand
acres
of
the
land
involved.
a
thousand
out
of
18,000
acres
for
the
land
involved
in
this
case
which
were
rather
diligently
most
of
the
oil
shale
claims
involved
here.
most
of
the
oil
shale
claims
involved
here
simply
want
to
look
that
between
1920
and
a
time
in
the
1950’s
when
a
speculator
came
around,
brought
up
shares
in
them,
very
small
amounts
of
money.
but
those
that
were
rather
diligently
worked
and
those
that
show
some
continuity
of
title,
i
should
think
there
might
be
some
equitable
considerations
involved
there
which
would
govern
the
government’s
use
of
the
failure
to
do
the
work
even
before
1935,
this
court
has
entertained
that
kind
of
relief
in
simpson
versus
union
oil
company.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
apt
case
of
377
u.s
13,
page
24
and
25
of
the
opinion,
the
court
reserved
the
question
whether
when
all
the
facts
are
known,
there
maybe
any
equities
that
would
warrant
only
perspective
application
and
damage
suits
of
the
rule
governing
price
fixing.
we
announced
today,
the
court
referred
to
that
opinion
again
last
year
in
the
donnelly
case.
certainly
there
are
some
similar
disposition
would
be
appropriate
here.
we
don’t
deny
that,
the
secretary
in
fact
in
the
administrative
opinion.
the
secretary
indicated
that
he
would
reopen
claims,
when
for
particular
claims,
they
were
equitable
or
legal
grounds
to
do
so.
that
has
not
yet
been
a
point
of
dispute
in
these
cases
so
far
as
i
understand.
no
one
has
yet
suggested
that
they
have
such
special
equitable
grounds
and
i
think
certainly
they
should
be
available
to
them.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
recall,
there
were
two
or
three
during
that
period
of
time
in
which
secretary
akies
(ph)
was
seeking
to
have
the
effect
of
that
decision
limited.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
secretary
akies
(ph)
was
seeking
to
have
the
effect
of
that
decision
limited.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
does.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
recall
that
questioning
establishes
the
proposition
that
flatly
to
the
extent
that
it
does.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
it
did.
we
would
have
to
ask
for
its
overruling
but
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
facts
of
krushnic
were
rather
special
and
the
government
really
has
no
complaint,
indeed
concedes
that
it
maybe
considerably
fairer
on
the
whole,
to
have
the
krushnic
decision
on
the
boards.
what
happened
in
that
case
was
that
individuals
had
been
working
their
land,
continued
to
work
their
land,
applied
for
patent.
and
the
secretary
decided
on
a
very
technical
basis.
that
in
one
year,
a
year
after
which
they
continued
to
work
and
that
which
no
one
took
any
notice
at
that
time.
in
one
year,
there
had
been
a
lapse
on
one
of
the
pieces
of
land
and
therefore
you
can’t
have
a
patent
to
that
land.
that’s
a
pretty
inequitable
result.
the
court
and
the
secretaries
generally
have
avoided
canceling
public
land
claims
on
that
kind
of
basis
and
the
government
doesn’t
want
to
be
able
to
do
so
in
particular.
i
think
on
that
sort
of
basis,
we’d
be
very
happy
to
have
krushnic
continued
in
effect.
i
do
want
to
talk
briefly
about
this
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
is
whether
virginia-colorado
requires
the
court
to
treat
these
old
claims
as
void.
that
was
the
only
issue
which
was
presented
and
decide
--
not
presented
but
which
was
decided
in
the
courts
below.
the
courts
below
never
had
to
reach
these
questions
of
the
administrative
practice
because
they
concluded
that
virginia-colorado
in
itself
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
claims
were
void.
but
we
think
the
contrary
conclusion
follows
very
strongly
from
the
fact
that
the
1920
act
saving
clause,
authorized
the
secretary
to
patent
only
certain
claims.
those
claims
which
were
valid
before
february
25,
1920
and
which
had
been
maintained
since
that
date
in
accordance
with
the
laws
under
which
they
were
made.
when
an
application
for
patent
was
made,
then
the
secretary
would
have
to
determine
two
things.
first,
was
the
claim
valid
on
february
25,
1920?
second,
has
it
been
maintained
since
that
time?
and
if
he
didn’t
make
that
second
determination,
he
might
dispose
off
the
public
domain
to
a
party
not
entitled
to.
in
west
versus
standard
oil,
this
court
said,
“whereby
by
the
terms
of
an
act,
the
secretary
is
required
upon
application
of
the
claimant
to
issue
a
patent.
congress
by
implication
confers
upon
the
secretary,
the
power
to
make
all
the
determinations
of
law
as
well
as
the
fact
which
are
essential
to
the
duty,
to
the
performance
to
the
duties
specifically
imposed”
here,
the
duty
was
to
patent
lands
on
which
they
were
existing
valid
claims
which
had
been
thereafter
maintained.
and
there
obviously
was
much
of
a
duty
to
inquire
into
the
question,
what
constituted
maintenance
and
whether
it
had
been
done
because
there
was
to
ask
what
was
required
for
validity,
and
whether
the
existing
claim
was
valid.
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
krushnic
decision.
at
page
318
of
this
court’s
report,
it
specifically
refers
to
the
necessity
that
the
officer,
the
secretary
in
this
case
read
the
law
and
therefore
in
a
certain
sense
construe
it
in
order
to
form
a
judgment.
and
the
court
there
specifically
noted
that
there
was
a
question
left
open
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
law.
it
said
that
the
question
left
open
was
whether
the
united
states
could
proceed
against
these
claims.
if
there
is
a
form
of
challenge
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
for
the
valid
existence
of
the
claim
which
was
intervening.
and
that
of
course
is
the
precise
situation
in
these
proceedings.
the
secretary
acted
within
the
range
left
open
by
the
court
in
krushnic.
he
acted
and
ordered
to
determine
whether
these
claims
had
been
maintained.
on
this
analysis,
the
only
possible
objection
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
the
issue
of
timing,
the
challenged
cancellations
arose
not
out
of
patent
applications
but
out
of
contest
which
the
secretary
brought
before
patent
applications
were
made.
and
applications
need
never
be
made
under
the
law.
the
secretary
brought
these
proceedings
to
clear
the
land
while
evidence
remain
fresh.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
appropriate
thing
for
him
to
do.
respondents
seem
to
argue
that
even
if
the
secretary
would
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
consider
these
issues
when
they
were
brought
to
him
on
a
claim
for
patent,
he
had
no
power
to
be
aggressive
about
them
but
that
question
was
settled
by
the
cameron
case
as
we
show
on
our
brief
at
pages
36
to
37,
where
the
summary
of
argument
in
this
court
shows
precisely
the
same
argument
to
have
been
made.
that
case
did
involve
discovery
not
maintenance,
but
we’ve
already
shown
that
at
least
at
the
stage
of
an
application
for
patent,
the
secretary
would
have
to
consider
both
issues
under
the
1920
act.
if
i
may,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
i
take
it
from
counsel’s
last
remarks
that
they
no
longer
claim
that
this
court
can
pass
on
these
claims
as
on
direct
review
and
so
i’ll
leave
that
part
of
our
argument
to
our
brief.
counsel
was
just
addressing
himself
to
the
west
case
to
justice
brandeis’
as
reference
to
the
duty
of
the
secretary,
of
course
we
rely
on
precisely
that
same
language,
under
section
37,
the
secretary
had
a
duty
to
ascertain
whether
claims
were
being
maintained.
if
they
weren’t
being
maintained,
it
was
in
error
for
him
to
get
patents
on
the
lands.
when
secretary
fall,
the
west
case
involved
secretary
fall,
when
secretary
fall
had
tried
to
give
away
government
lands
without
the
right
to
do
so,
he
wound
up
in
jail.
the
secretary
in
this
case,
in
all
of
these
cases,
was
following
his
plain
duty
under
the
statute
to
see
whether
these
claims
had
been
maintained.
now,
justice
brennan
you
asked
mr.
hamilton
what
did
that
word
mean?
what
might
it
mean,
he
kept
saying
he
would
answer,
he
has
finally
come
back
with
an
answer
which
appears
to
me
to
be,
well,
that
word
only
applied
to
oil
claims,
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
oil
shale
at
all.
that
may
be
true
in
this
sense.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
only
legislative
history
which
specifically
addresses
itself
to
the
question,
what
shall
happen
to
the
pending
oil
shale
claims,
he
says
that
anyone
who
has
an
oil
shale
claim
may
trade
it
in
for
a
lease.
that
is
the
sole
direct
legislative
history
on
the
oil
shale
claims
in
their
savings
as
you
may
get
a
lease,
the
lease
was
to
run
for
relatively
indefinitely
but
one
advantage
of
the
lease
was
that
the
secretary
could
suspend
the
payment
of
any
rent
or
royalty
for
five
years
and
it
was
quite
clear
while
that
was
provided,
that
was
provided
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
get
the
leases
and
then
recognition
that
people
weren’t
going
to
be
working
on
these
lands
for
a
while
because
nobody
knew
how
to
make
oil
from
shale.
mr.
hamilton’s
clients
are
working
very
hard
at
that
but
they
still
haven’t.
40
years
later,
50
years
later,
there
is
still
no
commercial
process
in
this
country
making
oil
from
shale.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
(voice
overlap)
public
policies
is
precisely
the
contrary.
the
public
policy
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
to
have
this
and
to
encourage
the
development
through
a
lease
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
today,
environmental
considerations,
not
the
least
of
them,
why
that
should
be
done.
now,
there
was
this
limited
exception
left
for
people
who
had
valid
claims
and
maintained
them
and
i
think
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history,
one
can
come
away
with
no
conclusion
other
then
that
meant
diligence.
mr.
hamilton
admitted
as
much.
what
he
said
was,
“this
language
came
in
there
because
of
people
who
were
prospecting
for
oil.”
now
the
rule,
as
it
applied
to
them,
wasn’t
just
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
work.
you
had
to
be
on
that
land
working
every
minute
trying
to
get
the
oil.
if
you
took
your
drills
away
for
thirty
days,
you
lost
your
right
to
the
land.
surely,
the
congress
which
imposed
that
kind
of
drastic
rule
would
never
have
considered
what
happened
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
none
in
practice.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
development
is
done
at
private
expense,
if
i
may
say
that
with
the
exception
of
--
one
of
mr.
hamilton’s
clients,
perhaps
two
of
them,
the
one
in
particular,
given
its
name
to
this
case
that
begun
in
1955,
there's
been
very
little
serious
work.
the
people
from
whom
these
claims
came,
13,000
acres
of
the
18
thousand
acres
in
this
case,
were
located
over
a
space
of
a
month.
less
than
a
month
by
people
who
never
returned
to
the
land,
never
replied
to
the
secretary,
work
was
never
done
on
that
land,
they
weren’t
maintained
in
any
sense
of
the
world.
in
1954,
there
was
some
speculator
who
went
around,
sort
of
gathering
quietly
gathering
up
the
claims
and
turning
them
into
what
the
oil
shale
company
was
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i’m
not
suggesting
that.
and
i
think
that
that
--
if
i
may,
it
takes
me
back
to
a
statement
that
mr.
hamilton
made.
he
said
that
before
1920,
nobody
ever
thought
that
the
government
could
have
any
interest
in
assessment
work.
that
is
true
only
as
a
general
rule.
there
were
cases
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
where
the
government
needed
a
land
for
a
dam
or
for
a
fort
or
for
some
other
specific
purpose
and
in
that
case,
it
went
out
and
it
got
interested
in
whether
the
land
was
being
maintained
again.
if
once
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
the
assessment
work
sense
among
others.
the
case
of
e.c.
kenny
which
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
our
case
is
that
a
condition
of
maintaining
of
maintaining
the
claim
is
that
you
continue
to
do
the
assessment
work
up
to
a
point
where
the
government
may
come
in
and
relocate
in
effect
that
in
this
kind
of
case
where
the
government
wishes
land
for
a
specific
use
whether
it
be
a
dam,
or
a
national
park,
or
a
national
forest
or
an
order
to
lease
it.
if
it
comes
along
and
it
finds
that
here
is
a
piece
of
land
and
the
people
who
have
claims
on
this
land
aren't
using
it,
aren't
maintaining
it,
aren't
doing
assessment
work
at
this
point,
it
can
post
the
land
and
take
it
back.
that’s
precisely
what
was
done
in
these
cases.
indeed,
this
is
a
case
very
much,
if
these
were
private
individuals
involved.
i
have
every
confidence
that
the
colorado
courts
would
say,
the
government,
it’s
taken
over
these
lands
by
adverse
possession
and
staked
them
in
1932.
no
one
else
briefed
on
them
till
1954.
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
one
could
have
a
state
of
law
that
said
that
these
claims
must
be
honored
today.
there
was
some
discussion
of
abandonment,
there's
a
remedy
for
the
government.
the
difficulty
with
that
remedy,
the
practical
difficulty
with
that
remedy
again
is
the
sentence
in
virginia-colorado.
before
i
get
to
it,
i’d
like
to
read
some
sentences
from
some
other
supreme
court
opinion.
in
union
oil
company
versus
smith,
volume
249
of
this
court’s
report,
the
court
said,
“the
possessory
right
is
lost
only
by
abandonment
as
by
non-performance
of
the
annual
assessment
work.”
in
donnelly
versus
united
states
in
228
u.s.,
the
court
said,
“of
course
under
the
mining
law,
a
claim
may
be
abandoned
by
failure
to
do
the
required
development
work.”
so
up
to
this
point,
the
government,
if
it
could
show
that
assessment
work
was
not
being
done,
might
have
some
kind
of
remedy
if
it
called
it
abandonment,
in
virginia-colorado,
we
find
a
very
different
sentence.
that
sentence
says,
“the
government
gained
no
right
by
the
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
the
failure
to
do
assessment
is
no
evidence
of
abandonment.”
but
that
is
a
very
pernicious
sentence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
it
is
principally
that
sentence
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
the
government’s
continuing
right
and
i
say
it
is
also
if
i
may
in
conclusion,
there
is
also
this
other
matter
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
secretary
back
in
1935
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
when
he
passed
on
these
claims
even
if
they
were
erroneous.
we
are
confident
mr.
justice
black
from
your
opinions
in
united
states
versus
san
francisco
and
united
states
versus
california
that
any
error
the
secretary
may
have
made
in
interpreting
this
court’s
holding
does
not
mean
that
on
the
basis
of
that
error,
the
government
must
give
up
its
claim
to
these
three
million
acres
of
land,
it
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
you’ll
turn
to
page
646
of
that
court’s
opinion
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
will
see
the
following
sentence.
plaintiff
had
lost
no
rights
by
a
failure
to
do
the
annual
assessment
work.
that
failure
gave
the
government
no
ground
of
forfeiture.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
you
can
be
quite
sure
that
in
the
ensuing
proceedings
and
it
--
i
must
say
it’s
a
reasonable
reading
of
that
language,
people
will
take
that
language
to
mean
that
it
was
no
evidence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
it
might.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
was
true
as
i
explained
before
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
review
for
a
moment
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
the
court
had
decided
wilbur
versus
krushnic
in
1930.
the
plaintiffs
of
the
virginia-colorado
company
had
been
doing
assessment
work
up
to
that
very
year.
when
wilbur
versus
krushnic
was
decided,
there
may
have
come
to
be
a
belief
or
it’s
no
longer
necessary
to
do
this
work.
so
for
15
months
and
it
was
only
15
months,
it
was
not
50
years,
the
work
stopped.
at
the
end
of
the
15
months,
the
secretary
came
in,
the
claimants
in
that
case,
unlike
most
of
the
claimants
here,
responded
and
they
said,
“no,
we’re
all
set
to
go
back
on
the
land.
we
are
ready
to
resume
doing
the
assessment
work.
we’re
going
to
do
it.”
and
that
was
stipulated
and
agreed
to
as
being
the
actual
state
of
affairs.
and
in
that
circumstances,
we
would
agree
that
there
was
no
ground
of
forfeiture.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
surely
will.[pause]
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
is
a
rather
complex
case,
it
might
be
useful
at
the
outset
to
state
a
very
brief
outline
form
how
i
expect
to
proceed.
as
the
court
knows,
the
case
principally
involves
section
37
of
the
leasing
act
of
1927
which
provides
for
the
patenting
of
certain
mining
claims
to
federal
land
which
were
valid
in
1920
and
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
were
thereafter
maintained
in
accordance
with
the
prior
law.
so
after
the
statement,
i
mean
first
to
examine
the
history
of
the
law
statements
regarding
the
maintenance
of
the
mining
claims
in
the
public
domain
and
i
do
that
in
full
consciousness
of
the
difficulties
which
the
solicitor
general
just
spoke
of
about
lawyer's
history
but
nonetheless
feeling
it
is
necessary
to
reexamine
that.
then
i
mean
to
cast
a
critical
eye
of
this
court's
decision
in
ickes
versus
virginia-colorado
development
corporation
which
is
the
other
focus
of
this
case
not
necessarily
to
procure
its
overruling
although
we
think
and
desire
that
it
should
be
overruled
but
is
a
means
of
making
clear
at
least
the
reasons
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
hope
we
can,
yes.
as
a
means
of
making
clear
the
reasons
at
least
why
we
feel
it
must
be
limited
to
its
particular
facts
and
that
i
hope
then
leads
naturally
to
the
questions
of
review
which
are
also
present
in
the
case.
this
case
is
part
of
a
battle
over
ownership
rights
to
several
hundred
thousands
of
acres
of
land
in
colorado
and
larger
amounts
in
utah
and
wyoming.
all
of
this
land
contains
a
rock
called
oil
shale
from
which
oil
can
be
distilled
at
a
high
temperature
and
no
one
knows
quite
how
much
oil
is
there
or
will
ever
be
recovered,
but
the
amounts
are
huge
and
i
think
there
will
be
agreement
that
it
represents
at
least
a
century
of
this
nation's
present
rate
of
consumption.
the
oil
shale
which
is
already
in
private
hands
represents
about
a
decade
of
that
century
or
perhaps
more
at
--
and
is
at
present
technically
the
most
feasible
portion.
the
oil
shale
over
which
owner
should
the
ownership
dispute
involve
in
this
case
is
raging
represents
a
similar
period
and
is
also
in
the
technically
accessible
portion
of
the
shale.
the
dispute
generally
is
whether
(inaudible)
in
the
technically
assessable
portion
of
the
shale
that
the
depth
of
which
the
shale
is
buried
under
the
overburden
varies
from
place
to
place
and
private
claims
tend
to
be
in
the
area
where
it’s
most
accessible.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
approximately.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
some
disputes
--
i
think
it's
efficient
to
say
it
involves
ten
years
worth
of
oil
consumption.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
out
of
a
hundred
or
more.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
that's
clear
that
it
exists
throughout
but
it
is
most
accessible
to
present
method
of
mining.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
one
is
yet
mining
although
the
oil
shale
corporation
certainly
has
plans
in
that
regard.
the
dispute
generally
is
whether
persons
who
made
claims
to
oil
shale
lands
before
the
lands
were
withdrawn
from
the
possibility
of
claim
in
1920
had
any
obligation
to
develop
their
claims
after
that
time
or
could
simply
hold
them
in
speculation
for
indefinite
periods
of
time
without
an
obligation
of
maintenance.
if
the
federal
government
has
clear
title
to
the
lands,
then
it
will
be
able
to
sell
leases
to
persons
whom
on
condition
really
that
they
develop
it
and
it
will
be
able
to
collect
substantial
royalties
once
they
do.
if
it
must
sell
or
patent
the
lands
to
the
present
claimants
of
whom
respondents
here
are
only
representative,
it
must
recognize
rights
on
land
which
have
been
left
completely
undeveloped
for
33
years
and
for
which
there
would
be
no
guarantee
of
development
in
the
future
and
it
would
receive
only
$2.50
an
acre
as
its
total
price
and
there
are
also
obvious
differences
in
the
government's
ability
to
control
pollution,
water
use
and
other
environmental
factors
and
to
guide
a
rational
development
to
the
resource.
these
particular
cases
here
as
a
result
of
the
secretary's
refusal
in
1964
to
issue
certain
patents
to
oil
shale
lands
including
lands
held
by
three
of
the
respondents
here
or
groups
of
respondents
i
should
say,
those
represented
by
respondents
napier,
umpleby,
and
brown.
he
refused
those
patents
on
the
ground
that
the
claims
had
been
cancelled
in
1931
and
early
1932
an
administrative
proceedings
which
were
permitted
to
become
final
at
that
time.
it
is
clear
that
he
probably
would
also
have
refused
to
patent
the
claims
now
owned
by
the
oil
shale
corporation
which
represents
the
fourth
group
of
respondents,
if
those
claims
had
been
before
him.
since
those
claims
too
had
been
cancelled
in
default
proceedings
in
the
early
30s,
then
these
cancellations
were
part
of
a
concerted
effort
on
the
secretary’s
part
to
identify
and
cancel
claims
that
were
not
being
maintained
in
the
early
30s
when
evidence
was
conservatively
fresher
than
it
is
now.
we
said
that
history
out
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
the
first
three
sets
of
claimants
napier,
umpleby,
and
brown
sought
review
of
the
secretary's
1964
decision
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
and
there,
they
were
joined
by
the
oil
shale
corporation
seeking
declaratory
judgment.
although
respondents
heard
a
number
of
reasons
below
for
requiring
the
secretary
to
ignore
these
old
and
final
administrative
decisions
from
the
30s,
the
district
court
and
subsequently
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
considered
only
one
ground
which
was
that
the
administrative
decisions
have
been
beyond
the
secretary
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
therefore
could
be
given
no
effect.
and
they
relied
--
excuse
me.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
most
of
them
are,
your
honor
and
to
varying
degrees.
interested
that
the
--
interested
i
think
is
a
--
is
a
question
of
degree.
i
should
say
the
oil
shale
company
and
the
union
oil
company
are
the
only
two
which
have
--
which
i'm
aware
that
have
made
a
very
substantial
independent
step
towards
actual
development.
in
terms
of
land
holdings
of
the
hearings
before
the
subcommittee
on
antitrust
and
monopoly
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
which
are
cited
at
least
in
respondents’
brief
and
i
think
in
ours
as
well
contain
a
number
of
statements
in
that
regard.
and
i
think
i
have
some
here
in
any
event
varying
of
the
top
27
oil
companies
in
the
nation,
here
we
are
at
page
192
of
those
hearings
that
shows
holdings
of
patented
lands,
the
union
oil
company
has
50,000
acres
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
page
192
of
the
antitrust
hearings.
but
it's
not
present
in
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
surely.
it
shows
the
union
oil
company
is
holding
50,000
acres,
mobil
oil
company
34,000
acres,
tidewater
oil
22,000
acres
and
so
forth.
i
think
tosco
in
those
hearings,
the
oil
shale
company
in
those
hearings
has
stated
that
it
owns
at
present
sufficient
land
to
produce
200,000
barrels
of
oil
daily
for
25
years
or
more.
and
most
of
the
oil
companies
are
in
a
similar
kind
of
position.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
is
there
--
well,
i
think
the
information
could
be
obtained
that
place
on
page
192
of
those
hearings
gives
a
complete
listing
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
couldn't
say
whether
they
have
rights
in
any
of
the
disputed
lands
or
not
but
i
would
think
since
they
are
a
major
holder,
i
would
think
it
unlikely
that
they
did
not
have
disputes
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
parties
to
the
old
administrative
proceeding,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
would
be
one
step
along
the
way
towards
procuring
patents
for
the
union
oil
company.
it
would
not
require
the
issue
of
--
issuance
of
patents
but
it
certainly
would
remove
an
obstacle
to
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
decided
that
in
passing
on
certain
applications
to
purchase
public
lands
in
containing
oil
shale,
the
secretary
of
interior
must
ignore
administrative
actions
which
became
final
almost
40
years
ago.
actions
which
purported
to
cancel
the
claims
to
possession
on
which
the
applications
were
based.
if
the
clients
were
effectively
canceled,
there
could
be
no
right
to
purchase
these
lands
today.
for
50
years,
the
lands
have
been
available
to
new
claimants,
only
by
lease.
the
statute
which
made
that
change.
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
provided
however
that
existing
valid
claims
could
still
qualify
for
purchase
under
the
old
law.
only
if
the
clients
were,
and
“thereafter
maintained
in
compliance
with
the
laws
under
which
initiated.”
the
old
law
was
the
general
mining
act
of
1872
and
it
conferred
an
exclusive
possessory
right
on
persons
who
made
the
discovery
of
valuable
minerals
on
the
public
domain
and
then
performed
certain
technical
functions
on
the
land
and
at
the
local
county
courthouse.
that
claim
remained
valid
for
as
long
as
the
individual
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
united
states
law.
in
particular,
the
law
required
the
annual
performance
of
$100.00
worth
of
so
called
assessment
work
every
year.
that
requirement
is
the
only
one
under
the
law
that
might
be
thought
that
have
to
do
with
maintaining
a
claim
once
it
is
made.
in
terms,
the
statute
states
only
that
failure
to
do
the
work
opens
the
land
to
relocation
by
another
prospector.
but
in
my
argument,
i
shall
show
that
the
government
too,
often
re-acquired
possessory
rights
in
this
land.
during
the
1920’s,
the
secretary
discovered
that
assessment
work
was
not
being
done
on
a
vast
bulk
of
oil
shale
claims.
at
first,
he
sought
to
treat
any
failure
to
do
the
required
work
however
technical
as
automatically
canceling
the
claims
and
then
a
case
which
vividly
illustrated
the
resulting
inequities,
wilbur
versus
krushnic.
this
court
held
that
that
drastic
rule
is
improper.
it
left
open
however
the
possibility
that
claims
could
be
canceled
by
direct
government
action
during
a
period
while
assessment
work
at
last.
the
secretary
took
that
hint
and
during
the
following
three
years,
brought
actions
against
over
20,000
of
these
claims
covering
an
area
of
over
2,800,000
acres
in
colorado,
wyoming,
and
utah.
to
cancel
those
claims
for
failure
to
do
the
required
maintenance.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
secretary
was
prepared
to
show
that
the
assessment
work
was
not
being
done
up
to
the
very
moment
when
he
acted.
and
that
the
government
had
physically
inspected
and
posted
the
claims
in
reclaiming
them
much
as
a
private
individual
might
have
done.
many
claimants
did
not
even
respond
to
the
secretary’s
process,
not
include
75%
of
the
lands
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
other
claimants
responded
to
the
process
but
permitted
the
proceedings
against
them
to
become
final
at
the
administrative
level.
that’s
the
remainder
of
the
land
at
issue
in
this
case.
one
set
of
claimants
however,
had
been
doing
their
assessment
work
up
to
the
very
date
of
the
krushnic
decision,
and
promptly
offered
to
resume
doing
that
work.
that
case
came
to
this
court
as
ickes
versus
the
virginia-colorado
development
corporation.
and
the
court
decided
that
that
offer
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
claimants
were
maintaining
their
claims
as
the
statute
required.
in
its
opinion
at
page
646,
that
ask
how
could
the
valid
claims
of
the
plaintiff
be
thereafter
maintained
in
compliance
with
the
laws
under
which
initiated
manifestly
by
a
resumption
of
work.
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
resume
and
the
bill
alleged
that
plaintiff
had
made
arrangements
for
resumption
and
that
work
would
have
been
resumed
if
the
department
of
interior
had
not
intervened.
to
my
knowledge,
that
fully
distinguishes
all
the
claims
in
this
case.
now
respondents
will
probably
examine
the
subsequent
history
in
much
greater
detail.
but
let
me
say
this,
in
the
ensuing
25
years,
few,
if
any
persons
worked
the
claims
as
few
if
any
had
worked
then
since
1920.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
it.
while
the
secretary
did
state
following
virginia-colorado
on
the
basis
of
language
appearing
in
that
decision
that
he
felt
constrained
to
regard
his
prior
decisions
as
void.
there
were
very
few
claimants
who
sought
reopening
or
corresponded
within
regarding
this.
there
were
20,000
cancelled
claims.
in
the
first
ten
years
following
the
decision
in
virginia-colorado
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
five
private
claimants
wrote
to
the
secretary
inquiring
about
the
status
of
their
claims.
and
it
was
not
until
1950,
15
years
after
virginia-colorado
that
the
first
patent
involving
a
canceled
claim
was
issued
and
that
appears
from
exhibit
95,
plaintiff’s
exhibit
95
at
page
148
of
the
record.
from
that
year
until
1960,
patents
were
issued
on
only
74,000
acres
of
the
almost
3
million
acres
of
land
involved
in
these
cancellations.
in
1962,
in
the
administrative
proceedings
challenged
here,
the
secretary
decided
that
virginia-colorado
did
not
require
him
to
ignore
cancellations
which
had
become
final
before
that
case
was
decided.
of
respondent’s
numerous
contentions,
only
one
is
properly
here
that
virginia-colorado
held
that
the
administrative
cancellations
of
the
1930’s
were
alter
various
of
the
secretary’s
authority
and
hence
that
their
claims
survive
these
proceedings
unimpaired.
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
contention,
it
was
the
only
contention
those
court’s
passed.
it
held
that
the
old
cancellations
must
be
regarded
as
void.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
on
october
13th
of
last
year.
thus
we
find
ourself
in
the
situation
where
a
claim
to
an
exclusive
possessory
right,
that’s
the
claim,
it
is
granted
by
the
statute,
made
in
1919,
may
have
to
be
honored
today
even
though
for
30
or
40
years
the
claimants
may
never
have
set
foot
on
the
land.
it
is
the
united
states
which
in
fact
has
been
the
exclusive
possessor
of
these
premises
for
most
of
this
time
and
which
has
used
the
land
for
many
purposes,
this
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
43.
indeed,
the
government’s
effective
possession
of
these
lands
has
been
foreign
access
of
the
colorado
prescription
period
of
18
years
even
if
one
starts
to
count
in
1931,
or
1932,
when
it
asserted
its
right
to
proceed
in
these
proceedings.
the
significance
to
the
case
is
substantial.
when
congress
passed
the
mineral
leasing
act
in
1920,
it
shows
leasing
over
private
ownership
as
the
preferable
means
of
developing
government
land
including
these
minerals.
it
did
so
in
order
to
avoid
monopolization
and
the
sequestration
of
fuel
resources,
to
assure
a
commensurate
return
to
the
government
and
perhaps
particularly
important
today
to
promote
environmental
interests.
under
a
lease,
the
government
can
control
the
mode
of
production
far
more
effectively
than
if
this
land
were
in
private
ownership.
this
factor,
indeed
all
of
these
factors
remain
relevant
to
that.
the
mineral
leasing
act
as
i
said
before
did
provide
as
an
exception
that
claims
would
be
patented,
could
be
reduced
to
private
ownership,
if
they
had
been
maintained
under
the
prior
law.
but
again,
it’s
the
only
requirement
under
the
1872
act
that
had
anything
to
do
with
maintaining
a
location.
once
it
was
made,
once
the
technical
requirements
of
filing
the
location
had
been
followed
out
was
the
requirement
that
you
do
a
$100.00
worth
of
work
a
year
on
the
claim.
the
proponent
of
that
requirement
senator
cole
of
california
told
the
senate
in
1872
and
this
is
said
out
at
page
13
of
our
amended
reply
brief,
that
the
provision
was
intended
and
i
quote
“to
ensure
good
faith
in
the
working
of
the
mines,
to
prevent
there
being
held
by
owners
an
indefinite
length
of
time
without
working,
to
require
the
miner
to
use
a
little
diligence
or
exertion
in
the
working
of
its
mine
or
else
leave
it
subject
to
a
beneficial
use
by
some
other
party.”
of
course,
if
you
did
make
a
valuable
discovery
on
the
lands
you
would
want
to
do
that
work,
otherwise
somebody
come
in
and
take
it
away
it
from
you.
the
conceptual
framework
of
that
process
relocation
is
interesting.
as
it
shown
by
this
court’s
opinion
in
1005
in
volume
104
of
the
reports
which
is
cited
in
respondent’s
brief
at
page
10
and
which
was
a
principal
precedent
in
both
the
krushnic
and
the
virginia-colorado
decisions.
the
interest
which
the
relocator
acquired,
required
not
from
the
previous
possessor
but
from
the
united
states
which
had
to
receive
it
in
some
fashion
and
as
we
note
in
our
reply
at
page
14,
this
court
has
frequently
acquitted
failure
to
do
assessment
work
with
abandonment
of
the
claims.
to
this
extent,
the
remark
which
appears
in
the
virginia-colorado
decision,
that
failure
to
do
assessment
work
gives
the
government
no
ground
of
forfeiture
on
abandonment
grounds
as
plainly
incorrect.
it
may
have
been
correct
in
that
case
where
15
months
after
there
was
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work
the
claimants
came
forward
and
said,
“we’re
going
to
start
right
up
again”
but
it
certainly
was
not
correct
as
a
statement
of
general
law.
now
it
is
true
that
in
general,
the
maintenance
requirements
were
privately
enforced.
that
was
because
in
general,
the
united
states
had
no
need
for
this
land
but
there
are
cases
in
which
the
government
does
want
its
land.
it
may
want
to
create
a
national
park
or
an
irrigation
project.
and
in
cases
like
that,
there
was
an
established
body
of
law
set
out
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
52
to
the
effect
that
the
secretary
could
withdraw
the
land
from
further
location
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
assessment
work
was
not
done,
the
government
could
retrieve
the
land
for
its
own
use.
this
is
not
a
small
matter
either.
in
the
recent
construction
of
the
grand
canyon
dam,
there
were
over
7,000
of
these
old
claims
on
the
land
there.
the
claims
which
had
to
be
cleared
off
the
land
and
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
go
to
considerable
expense
because
this
court
had
said
in
virginia-colorado
that
it
could
place
no
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
claimants
of
those
lands
hadn’t
been
doing
and
recording
their
assessment
work
as
the
statute
requires
for
many
years
since.
as
i
say
the
secretary
did
rule
in
a
small
but
consistent
body
of
law
that
in
these
situations
where
the
government
had
a
special
use
for
land.
private
planes
would
remain
valid
only
as
long
as
they
were
maintained
and
then
they
would
revert
back
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
for
which
the
land
around
it
had
been
withdrawn.
sometimes
he
used
the
word
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i’m
not
quite
sure
how
to
respond
to
that.
the
only
thing
in
the
prior
law
that
has
to
do
with
maintenance
is
the
requirement
of
assessment
work.
there
is
no
other
provision
of
the
prior
law
that
says
anything
about
continuing
to
work
the
claim.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
occupancy
in
continued
prospect,
at
least
the
continued
prospecting
part
of
it
might
very
well
be
considered
as
maintenance
or
assessment
work
as
the
court
is
aware
from
the
coleman
case.
there
have
been
many
situations
where
persons
have
taken
the
government’s
land
extensively
for
mineral
purposes
and
actually
wanted
it
for
a
seaside
resort
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
would
be
the
government’s
--
the
government’s
position
here
is
that
one
can
only
understand
the
provision
that
these
claims
had
to
be
maintained
as
referring
to
assessment
work
because
there
is
no
other
provision
of
the
prior
law
that
gave
any
notion
whatever
about
maintenance.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
beginning
in
1950,
somewhat,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
2%
of
the
total
amount
of
land
redone,
i
think
it
began
perhaps
almost
inadvertently.
people
in
the
denver
office
saw
these
things
coming
in.
they
saw
the
situation
in
which
the
lands
were
being
obtained
and
they
gradually
came
to
be
pressured.
the
pressure
on
washington
from
the
district,
well
this
is
a
terrible
thing
we’re
doing.
why
do
we
have
to
give
the
land
to
away
like
this?
and
then
in
these
kinds
of
circumstances
and
it
was
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
whether
there
is
a
6
year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
patents
and
that
6
years
has
long
since
passed.
and
unless
there
were
some
sort
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
or
something
of
that
sort
the
government
cannot
reopen.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
that
is
respondent’s
contention.
that’s
not
actually
what
he
said
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
opinion
on
which
they
rely
is
an
opinion
called
the
shale
oil
company
which
appears
in
the
volume
55
of
the
department’s
reports,
and
at
page
290
is
the
language
they’re
concerned
with.
they
say
the
say
the
above
mentioned
decision
and
instructions
involved
in
virginia-colorado
that
is.
i
hereby
recalled
and
vacated
two
other
specific
decisions
and
other
departmental
decisions
in
conflict
with
this
decision,
i
hereby
overruled
the
commission’s
decision
is
reversed
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
application.
and
there
did
follow
from
that,
we
can’t
deny
it.
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
the
secretary
used
the
words
like
void
in
talking
about
his
view
of
what
this
court
had
done.
but
i
think
it’s
well
established
in
the
law
that
on
the
state,
the
secretary
may
make
in
interpreting
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
i
would
say
as
well
of
this
court’s
holding.
that
he
may
make
a
legal
mistake
of
that
sort,
can
hardly
forfeit
for
all
time,
the
government’s
interest
in
the
land
involved.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
that’s
what
at
issue
in
this
case
i
believe.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
that’s
right,
at
page
290.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
in
its
opinion
and
of
course
it
does
give
some
trouble
but
as
i
said
before,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
established
for
the
court
in
united
states
versus
california
and
united
states
versus
san
francisco,
that
even
where
there
may
have
been
substantial
investments
made
and
by
and
large,
that’s
not
the
case
in
these
proceedings.
individual
secretaries
by
mistakes
they
may
make
in
construing
the
law
simply
can’t
forfeit
the
government’s
right
in
the
public
lands.
we’re
dealing
with
3
million
acres
of
public
land
here.
today,
only
74,000
acres
of
that
land
has
been
reduced
to
patent.
the
first
of
those
patents
was
issued
in
1950
and
i
really
think
that
the
court
would
have
no
difficulty
in
dealing
with
that
situation.
as
i
was
saying,
sometimes
in
this
body
of
law
which
permitted
the
government
to
retrieve
land
which
it
needed
for
specific
purposes.
sometimes,
the
secretary
used
the
words
assessment
work.
sometimes
he
just
talks
about
maintaining
the
claim
and
respondent
say,
“well
therefore
those
opinions
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
assessment
work”
but
again,
the
only
provision
in
the
statute
which
in
any
way
relates
the
maintaining
of
claim
is
the
provision
for
assessment
work.
there
simply
is
nothing
else
in
the
statute
relevant
on
that
issue.
now,
in
our
view
the
leasing
act
is
just
like
a
withdrawal
for
a
national
park
or
a
fort.
it
reflects
the
congressional
judgment
about
how
the
public
lands
ought
to
be
used.
and
so,
in
our
view,
it
gives
the
government
the
same
right.
and
now,
the
significant
aspect
is
that
that
act
ended,
eliminated
the
possibility
that
some
private
individual
could
come
in
to
the
lands
that
were
affected
and
put
a
claim
on
them,
that
would
end
this
old
claims.
because
the
act
withdrew
not
only
the
minerals,
not
only
the
oil
shale
from
location,
it
withdrew
the
lands
themselves.
even
if
you
found
gold
or
copper
on
the
land,
you
could
get
it
only
by
lease.
as
we
show
in
our
amended
reply
brief
at
pages
9
to
10.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
four
ways
that
one
could
interpret
this
provision
of
the
1920
law.
first
one
could
say,
that
assessment
work
must
be
done
and
as
soon
as
it’s
not
done
for
any
period
of
time,
however
brief,
whether
or
not
the
government
finds
out
about
it
at
that
time,
the
land
is
automatically
retrieved
for
government’s
use.
that
is
what
this
court
rejected
in
wilbur
versus
krushnic
and
we
don’t
urge
it
today.
the
second
possibility
is
the
government’s
position
in
virginia-colorado.
that
the
secretary
could
act
as
a
private
relocator
could.
where
he
has
a
specific
need
for
the
land
where
it
is
been
withdrawn
for
particular
government
purpose.
he
may
go
on
and
if
he
finds
land
where
assessment
work
isn’t
being
done
at
that
time,
he
stakes
it,
brings
an
adversary
proceeding
to
cancel
the
claim.
the
third
possibility
is
what
we
think
this
court
said
in
virginia-colorado,
which
is
that
the
government
can
go
around
periodically
and
more
or
less
make
demands
on
the
holder
to
these
claims
to
come
forward.
that
was
what
the
claimants
in
virginia-colorado
did.
this
court
said
that
they
did
it
and
relied
on
there
having
done
it.
the
court
said,
they
wanted
to
resume
their
work.
they
would
have
resumed
their
work
if
the
government
hadn’t
been
there.
that
is
a
--
perhaps
a
very
fine
line
to
draw.
it
isn’t
fully
adequate
but
it’s
certainly
better
than
the
fourth
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
respondent’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
maintenance
at
all,
that
the
government
has
no
interest
in
whether
a
claimant
develops
this
land
or
not.
when
somebody
went
out
in
the
winter
of
1919
and
staked
30,000
acres
over
a
five
day
period,
that’s
perhaps
too
large
and
i
think
it
was
--
there
were
several
that
were
2,000,
3,000,
4,000
acres
over
that
period
of
time.
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
government’s
interest
in
the
oil
shale
on
that
land
and
there
is
simply
no
way
that
the
government
can
retrieve
it.
the
best
short
comment
i
know
on
that
position
was
offered
in
the
house
by
representative
taylor
in
colorado.
his
credentials
on
land
issues
are
impeccable
and
are
vouched
for
by
respondents
themselves.
they
made
these
remarks
after
virginia-colorado
was
decided
in
an
evident
disagreement
with
it.
he
said,
people
have
been
holding
it
--
that
is
the
oil
shale
lands
for
years
and
years
without
complying
that
the
law.
that
is
the
assessment
work
law,
and
without
being
entitled
to
it.
this
is
to
require
than
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
is
to
maintain
their
claims
or
else
let
the
land
revert
back.
respondents
make
section
37
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
was
at
the
time
talking
to
a
statute
that
was
before
the
house.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
disappeared.
that
is
to
say
it
was
not
finally
acted
upon.
there
was
no
voting
it
down,
but
it
didn’t
pass.
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard
if
i
may
that
i
think
congress
has
always
labored
in
this
area
under
a
substantial
difficulty
of
the
court’s
decision
in
virginia-colorado
in
a
sense
declared
property
rights.
congress
would
interfere
with
those
rights
if
indeed
those
were
the
rights
only
at
its
constitutional
parole.
and
in
any
event,
the
congress
could
hardly
do
anything
about
period
of
non-work
which
had
been
observed
prior
to
the
court’s
decision
in
virginia-colorado
from
1920
to
1933,
there’s
nothing
that
congress
could
have
done
to
revive
the
disuse
or
to
revive
the
government
proceedings
if
indeed
as
well
as
sometimes
felt
at
the
time
they
had
been
in
the
sense
voided
by
this
court’s
decision.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief.
there
was
an
extraordinary,
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
bills.
there
is
a
rather
an
extraordinary
amount
of
care
about
their
prospectivity.
this
particular
bill
was
only
a
perspective
bill.
it
would
only
have
acted
for
the
future,
about
the
limitations
on
what
the
government
could
do.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
bill
has
said
that
in
the
future.
you
must
do
assessment
work
because
i
think
congress
felt
that
would
be
changing
the
conditions
of
the
property
ownership.
there
was
something
in
there
about
why
you
have
to
come
in
and
register
the
lands.
they
felt
they
could
go
that
far.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
in
substantial
part
it
is
mr.
justice
brennan,
we’ve
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
18,
a
number
of
remarks
by
congressman.
all
of
them
addressed
to
what
they
considered
to
be
the
error
of
this
court
in
that
case
and
expressing
surprise
that
the
way
it
had
interpreted
the
land
law,
and
i
think
you
will
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
bills
some
alarm
about
whether
congress,
could
the
congress
could
ever
said
it
right.
this
court
clearly
enough
could
do
so.
respondent’s
view
of
the
bill
makes
it
into
a
good
deal
more
than
a
savings
clause
because
in
their
view,
it
creates
an
indefeasible
possessory
right
in
public
land
regarding
which
they
have
no
effective
obligation
of
care,
or
maintenance,
or
development.
no
such
right
ever
existed
under
these
nations
mining
laws
and
respondents
can
point
to
no
statement
and
congress
or
elsewhere
suggesting
that
that
would
be
the
just
or
desirable
way
to
dispose
off
our
lands.
75%
of
the
lands
involved
in
this
case
would
never
work
on.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
from
1920
until
they
were
bought
in
1954
for
pennies
an
acre.
and
the
congress
would
provide
only
five
rent
free
years
of
listing
oil
shale
lands,
certainly
did
not
entertain
the
notion.
that
it
was
enabling
persons
simply
to
sit
on
existing
claims
for
decade
after
decade
without
investment
or
obligations
or
fear
of
loss.
the
entire
lack
of
justification,
either
illegal
or
equitable
for
that
position
demonstrates
the
fallacy
of
the
claim.
now
whether
or
not
this
court
would
overrule
virginia-colorado,
that
seems
indisputable
to
us
that
the
secretary
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
those
old
cancellation
proceedings
when
they
were
brought
and
to
those
which
became
final
before
virginia-colorado
was
decided
can
be
given
effect
today.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
would
certainly
prefer
that
it'd
be
overruled
in
the
sense
that
it
would
remove
what
has
been
a
substantial
incubus
on
the
administration
of
the
public
lands
and
would
permit
considerably
more
rational
approach
to
this
issue
of
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
in
particular,
i
think,
the
particular
language
which
i
find
the
most
unfortunate,
is
the
court’s
remark
in
the
opinion
that
failure
to
do
assessment
work
gave
no
ground
for
a
holding
of
abandonment
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
reads
as
if
it
were.
i
know
the
tenth
circuit
believes
that
it
is
and
the
other
district
judges
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
but
as
i
was
remarking
to
justice
burger
--
to
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
in
this
circumstance
because
it
is
involved
with
property.
because
the
fifth
amendment
inevitably
gets
in
when
you
start
changing
the
conditions
of
property,
really
that
statutory
holding
has
something
of
a
constitutional
pass
to
it
and
i
don’t
believe
you
can
[voice
overlap]
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
certainly
have.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
ordinarily
you
do
not.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
the
bill
had
passed,
it
would
have
provided
that
the
list
for
federal
registration
of
these
claims
and
i
don’t
--frankly
don’t
recall
what
the
remainder
of
the
bill
was.
one
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
certainly
in
the
legislative
history,
there
is
mentioned
of
that
decision
and
what
it
had
done.
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
as
i
have
explained,
congress
didn’t
feel
it
could
undo
the
decision.
it
felt
it
could
make
some
corrections
for
the
future
but
because
land
is
involved
here,
there
are
some
constitutional
inhibitions
about
congress
taking
it
away
by
statute.
that
this
court
had
made
a
mistake,
i
think
the
court
could
correct
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
number
of
effects.
first,
as
to
those
lands
which
have
already
been
patented,
which
have
already
been
sold
to
private
individuals,
i
should
think
that
be
no
effect.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
because
the
transaction
is
done
there,
it’s
a
six
year
statute
of
limitations
on
undoing
the
transactions,
six
years
has
passed.
second
as
to
the
period
before
the
decision
and
it’s
the
period
before
1935,
i
should
think
an
overruling
would
permit
the
government
to
rely
on
a
failure
to
do
assessment
work
at
that
time.
i
should
think
an
overruling
would
have
no
effect
on
what
was
done
to
the
land
between
the
date
of
this
court’s
decision
in
1935
and
the
date
of
its
decision
overruling
the
opinion.
but
certainly
the
opinion
was
there
and
one
can’t
deny
its
presence
in
that
sense.
a
more
difficult
question
would
arise
as
to
certain
claims.
there
are
claims
for
example,
the
(inaudible)
claims
and
the
oiler
claims
in
this
case
represent
about
a
thousand
acres
of
the
land
involved.
a
thousand
out
of
18,000
acres
for
the
land
involved
in
this
case
which
were
rather
diligently
most
of
the
oil
shale
claims
involved
here.
most
of
the
oil
shale
claims
involved
here
simply
want
to
look
that
between
1920
and
a
time
in
the
1950’s
when
a
speculator
came
around,
brought
up
shares
in
them,
very
small
amounts
of
money.
but
those
that
were
rather
diligently
worked
and
those
that
show
some
continuity
of
title,
i
should
think
there
might
be
some
equitable
considerations
involved
there
which
would
govern
the
government’s
use
of
the
failure
to
do
the
work
even
before
1935,
this
court
has
entertained
that
kind
of
relief
in
simpson
versus
union
oil
company.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
apt
case
of
377
u.s
13,
page
24
and
25
of
the
opinion,
the
court
reserved
the
question
whether
when
all
the
facts
are
known,
there
maybe
any
equities
that
would
warrant
only
perspective
application
and
damage
suits
of
the
rule
governing
price
fixing.
we
announced
today,
the
court
referred
to
that
opinion
again
last
year
in
the
donnelly
case.
certainly
there
are
some
similar
disposition
would
be
appropriate
here.
we
don’t
deny
that,
the
secretary
in
fact
in
the
administrative
opinion.
the
secretary
indicated
that
he
would
reopen
claims,
when
for
particular
claims,
they
were
equitable
or
legal
grounds
to
do
so.
that
has
not
yet
been
a
point
of
dispute
in
these
cases
so
far
as
i
understand.
no
one
has
yet
suggested
that
they
have
such
special
equitable
grounds
and
i
think
certainly
they
should
be
available
to
them.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
recall,
there
were
two
or
three
during
that
period
of
time
in
which
secretary
akies
(ph)
was
seeking
to
have
the
effect
of
that
decision
limited.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
secretary
akies
(ph)
was
seeking
to
have
the
effect
of
that
decision
limited.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
does.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
don’t
recall
that
questioning
establishes
the
proposition
that
flatly
to
the
extent
that
it
does.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
it
did.
we
would
have
to
ask
for
its
overruling
but
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
facts
of
krushnic
were
rather
special
and
the
government
really
has
no
complaint,
indeed
concedes
that
it
maybe
considerably
fairer
on
the
whole,
to
have
the
krushnic
decision
on
the
boards.
what
happened
in
that
case
was
that
individuals
had
been
working
their
land,
continued
to
work
their
land,
applied
for
patent.
and
the
secretary
decided
on
a
very
technical
basis.
that
in
one
year,
a
year
after
which
they
continued
to
work
and
that
which
no
one
took
any
notice
at
that
time.
in
one
year,
there
had
been
a
lapse
on
one
of
the
pieces
of
land
and
therefore
you
can’t
have
a
patent
to
that
land.
that’s
a
pretty
inequitable
result.
the
court
and
the
secretaries
generally
have
avoided
canceling
public
land
claims
on
that
kind
of
basis
and
the
government
doesn’t
want
to
be
able
to
do
so
in
particular.
i
think
on
that
sort
of
basis,
we’d
be
very
happy
to
have
krushnic
continued
in
effect.
i
do
want
to
talk
briefly
about
this
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
is
whether
virginia-colorado
requires
the
court
to
treat
these
old
claims
as
void.
that
was
the
only
issue
which
was
presented
and
decide
--
not
presented
but
which
was
decided
in
the
courts
below.
the
courts
below
never
had
to
reach
these
questions
of
the
administrative
practice
because
they
concluded
that
virginia-colorado
in
itself
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
claims
were
void.
but
we
think
the
contrary
conclusion
follows
very
strongly
from
the
fact
that
the
1920
act
saving
clause,
authorized
the
secretary
to
patent
only
certain
claims.
those
claims
which
were
valid
before
february
25,
1920
and
which
had
been
maintained
since
that
date
in
accordance
with
the
laws
under
which
they
were
made.
when
an
application
for
patent
was
made,
then
the
secretary
would
have
to
determine
two
things.
first,
was
the
claim
valid
on
february
25,
1920?
second,
has
it
been
maintained
since
that
time?
and
if
he
didn’t
make
that
second
determination,
he
might
dispose
off
the
public
domain
to
a
party
not
entitled
to.
in
west
versus
standard
oil,
this
court
said,
“whereby
by
the
terms
of
an
act,
the
secretary
is
required
upon
application
of
the
claimant
to
issue
a
patent.
congress
by
implication
confers
upon
the
secretary,
the
power
to
make
all
the
determinations
of
law
as
well
as
the
fact
which
are
essential
to
the
duty,
to
the
performance
to
the
duties
specifically
imposed”
here,
the
duty
was
to
patent
lands
on
which
they
were
existing
valid
claims
which
had
been
thereafter
maintained.
and
there
obviously
was
much
of
a
duty
to
inquire
into
the
question,
what
constituted
maintenance
and
whether
it
had
been
done
because
there
was
to
ask
what
was
required
for
validity,
and
whether
the
existing
claim
was
valid.
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
krushnic
decision.
at
page
318
of
this
court’s
report,
it
specifically
refers
to
the
necessity
that
the
officer,
the
secretary
in
this
case
read
the
law
and
therefore
in
a
certain
sense
construe
it
in
order
to
form
a
judgment.
and
the
court
there
specifically
noted
that
there
was
a
question
left
open
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
law.
it
said
that
the
question
left
open
was
whether
the
united
states
could
proceed
against
these
claims.
if
there
is
a
form
of
challenge
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
for
the
valid
existence
of
the
claim
which
was
intervening.
and
that
of
course
is
the
precise
situation
in
these
proceedings.
the
secretary
acted
within
the
range
left
open
by
the
court
in
krushnic.
he
acted
and
ordered
to
determine
whether
these
claims
had
been
maintained.
on
this
analysis,
the
only
possible
objection
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
the
issue
of
timing,
the
challenged
cancellations
arose
not
out
of
patent
applications
but
out
of
contest
which
the
secretary
brought
before
patent
applications
were
made.
and
applications
need
never
be
made
under
the
law.
the
secretary
brought
these
proceedings
to
clear
the
land
while
evidence
remain
fresh.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
appropriate
thing
for
him
to
do.
respondents
seem
to
argue
that
even
if
the
secretary
would
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
consider
these
issues
when
they
were
brought
to
him
on
a
claim
for
patent,
he
had
no
power
to
be
aggressive
about
them
but
that
question
was
settled
by
the
cameron
case
as
we
show
on
our
brief
at
pages
36
to
37,
where
the
summary
of
argument
in
this
court
shows
precisely
the
same
argument
to
have
been
made.
that
case
did
involve
discovery
not
maintenance,
but
we’ve
already
shown
that
at
least
at
the
stage
of
an
application
for
patent,
the
secretary
would
have
to
consider
both
issues
under
the
1920
act.
if
i
may,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thank
you.
i
take
it
from
counsel’s
last
remarks
that
they
no
longer
claim
that
this
court
can
pass
on
these
claims
as
on
direct
review
and
so
i’ll
leave
that
part
of
our
argument
to
our
brief.
counsel
was
just
addressing
himself
to
the
west
case
to
justice
brandeis’
as
reference
to
the
duty
of
the
secretary,
of
course
we
rely
on
precisely
that
same
language,
under
section
37,
the
secretary
had
a
duty
to
ascertain
whether
claims
were
being
maintained.
if
they
weren’t
being
maintained,
it
was
in
error
for
him
to
get
patents
on
the
lands.
when
secretary
fall,
the
west
case
involved
secretary
fall,
when
secretary
fall
had
tried
to
give
away
government
lands
without
the
right
to
do
so,
he
wound
up
in
jail.
the
secretary
in
this
case,
in
all
of
these
cases,
was
following
his
plain
duty
under
the
statute
to
see
whether
these
claims
had
been
maintained.
now,
justice
brennan
you
asked
mr.
hamilton
what
did
that
word
mean?
what
might
it
mean,
he
kept
saying
he
would
answer,
he
has
finally
come
back
with
an
answer
which
appears
to
me
to
be,
well,
that
word
only
applied
to
oil
claims,
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
oil
shale
at
all.
that
may
be
true
in
this
sense.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
only
legislative
history
which
specifically
addresses
itself
to
the
question,
what
shall
happen
to
the
pending
oil
shale
claims,
he
says
that
anyone
who
has
an
oil
shale
claim
may
trade
it
in
for
a
lease.
that
is
the
sole
direct
legislative
history
on
the
oil
shale
claims
in
their
savings
as
you
may
get
a
lease,
the
lease
was
to
run
for
relatively
indefinitely
but
one
advantage
of
the
lease
was
that
the
secretary
could
suspend
the
payment
of
any
rent
or
royalty
for
five
years
and
it
was
quite
clear
while
that
was
provided,
that
was
provided
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
get
the
leases
and
then
recognition
that
people
weren’t
going
to
be
working
on
these
lands
for
a
while
because
nobody
knew
how
to
make
oil
from
shale.
mr.
hamilton’s
clients
are
working
very
hard
at
that
but
they
still
haven’t.
40
years
later,
50
years
later,
there
is
still
no
commercial
process
in
this
country
making
oil
from
shale.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
(voice
overlap)
public
policies
is
precisely
the
contrary.
the
public
policy
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
to
have
this
and
to
encourage
the
development
through
a
lease
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
today,
environmental
considerations,
not
the
least
of
them,
why
that
should
be
done.
now,
there
was
this
limited
exception
left
for
people
who
had
valid
claims
and
maintained
them
and
i
think
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history,
one
can
come
away
with
no
conclusion
other
then
that
meant
diligence.
mr.
hamilton
admitted
as
much.
what
he
said
was,
“this
language
came
in
there
because
of
people
who
were
prospecting
for
oil.”
now
the
rule,
as
it
applied
to
them,
wasn’t
just
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
work.
you
had
to
be
on
that
land
working
every
minute
trying
to
get
the
oil.
if
you
took
your
drills
away
for
thirty
days,
you
lost
your
right
to
the
land.
surely,
the
congress
which
imposed
that
kind
of
drastic
rule
would
never
have
considered
what
happened
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
none
in
practice.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
development
is
done
at
private
expense,
if
i
may
say
that
with
the
exception
of
--
one
of
mr.
hamilton’s
clients,
perhaps
two
of
them,
the
one
in
particular,
given
its
name
to
this
case
that
begun
in
1955,
there's
been
very
little
serious
work.
the
people
from
whom
these
claims
came,
13,000
acres
of
the
18
thousand
acres
in
this
case,
were
located
over
a
space
of
a
month.
less
than
a
month
by
people
who
never
returned
to
the
land,
never
replied
to
the
secretary,
work
was
never
done
on
that
land,
they
weren’t
maintained
in
any
sense
of
the
world.
in
1954,
there
was
some
speculator
who
went
around,
sort
of
gathering
quietly
gathering
up
the
claims
and
turning
them
into
what
the
oil
shale
company
was
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i’m
not
suggesting
that.
and
i
think
that
that
--
if
i
may,
it
takes
me
back
to
a
statement
that
mr.
hamilton
made.
he
said
that
before
1920,
nobody
ever
thought
that
the
government
could
have
any
interest
in
assessment
work.
that
is
true
only
as
a
general
rule.
there
were
cases
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
where
the
government
needed
a
land
for
a
dam
or
for
a
fort
or
for
some
other
specific
purpose
and
in
that
case,
it
went
out
and
it
got
interested
in
whether
the
land
was
being
maintained
again.
if
once
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
the
assessment
work
sense
among
others.
the
case
of
e.c.
kenny
which
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
our
case
is
that
a
condition
of
maintaining
of
maintaining
the
claim
is
that
you
continue
to
do
the
assessment
work
up
to
a
point
where
the
government
may
come
in
and
relocate
in
effect
that
in
this
kind
of
case
where
the
government
wishes
land
for
a
specific
use
whether
it
be
a
dam,
or
a
national
park,
or
a
national
forest
or
an
order
to
lease
it.
if
it
comes
along
and
it
finds
that
here
is
a
piece
of
land
and
the
people
who
have
claims
on
this
land
aren't
using
it,
aren't
maintaining
it,
aren't
doing
assessment
work
at
this
point,
it
can
post
the
land
and
take
it
back.
that’s
precisely
what
was
done
in
these
cases.
indeed,
this
is
a
case
very
much,
if
these
were
private
individuals
involved.
i
have
every
confidence
that
the
colorado
courts
would
say,
the
government,
it’s
taken
over
these
lands
by
adverse
possession
and
staked
them
in
1932.
no
one
else
briefed
on
them
till
1954.
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
one
could
have
a
state
of
law
that
said
that
these
claims
must
be
honored
today.
there
was
some
discussion
of
abandonment,
there's
a
remedy
for
the
government.
the
difficulty
with
that
remedy,
the
practical
difficulty
with
that
remedy
again
is
the
sentence
in
virginia-colorado.
before
i
get
to
it,
i’d
like
to
read
some
sentences
from
some
other
supreme
court
opinion.
in
union
oil
company
versus
smith,
volume
249
of
this
court’s
report,
the
court
said,
“the
possessory
right
is
lost
only
by
abandonment
as
by
non-performance
of
the
annual
assessment
work.”
in
donnelly
versus
united
states
in
228
u.s.,
the
court
said,
“of
course
under
the
mining
law,
a
claim
may
be
abandoned
by
failure
to
do
the
required
development
work.”
so
up
to
this
point,
the
government,
if
it
could
show
that
assessment
work
was
not
being
done,
might
have
some
kind
of
remedy
if
it
called
it
abandonment,
in
virginia-colorado,
we
find
a
very
different
sentence.
that
sentence
says,
“the
government
gained
no
right
by
the
failure
to
do
assessment
work.
the
failure
to
do
assessment
is
no
evidence
of
abandonment.”
but
that
is
a
very
pernicious
sentence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
it
is
principally
that
sentence
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
the
government’s
continuing
right
and
i
say
it
is
also
if
i
may
in
conclusion,
there
is
also
this
other
matter
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
secretary
back
in
1935
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
when
he
passed
on
these
claims
even
if
they
were
erroneous.
we
are
confident
mr.
justice
black
from
your
opinions
in
united
states
versus
san
francisco
and
united
states
versus
california
that
any
error
the
secretary
may
have
made
in
interpreting
this
court’s
holding
does
not
mean
that
on
the
basis
of
that
error,
the
government
must
give
up
its
claim
to
these
three
million
acres
of
land,
it
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
your
honor
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
you’ll
turn
to
page
646
of
that
court’s
opinion
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
will
see
the
following
sentence.
plaintiff
had
lost
no
rights
by
a
failure
to
do
the
annual
assessment
work.
that
failure
gave
the
government
no
ground
of
forfeiture.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
you
can
be
quite
sure
that
in
the
ensuing
proceedings
and
it
--
i
must
say
it’s
a
reasonable
reading
of
that
language,
people
will
take
that
language
to
mean
that
it
was
no
evidence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
it
might.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
was
true
as
i
explained
before
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
review
for
a
moment
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
the
court
had
decided
wilbur
versus
krushnic
in
1930.
the
plaintiffs
of
the
virginia-colorado
company
had
been
doing
assessment
work
up
to
that
very
year.
when
wilbur
versus
krushnic
was
decided,
there
may
have
come
to
be
a
belief
or
it’s
no
longer
necessary
to
do
this
work.
so
for
15
months
and
it
was
only
15
months,
it
was
not
50
years,
the
work
stopped.
at
the
end
of
the
15
months,
the
secretary
came
in,
the
claimants
in
that
case,
unlike
most
of
the
claimants
here,
responded
and
they
said,
“no,
we’re
all
set
to
go
back
on
the
land.
we
are
ready
to
resume
doing
the
assessment
work.
we’re
going
to
do
it.”
and
that
was
stipulated
and
agreed
to
as
being
the
actual
state
of
affairs.
and
in
that
circumstances,
we
would
agree
that
there
was
no
ground
of
forfeiture.
thank
you
very
much.
