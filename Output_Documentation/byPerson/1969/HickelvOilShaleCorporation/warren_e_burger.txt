it's

the

it

then
we'll

but
what
congress
do
with

chief

e.

well
must
we
not
reasonably
assume
that
the

of
that

thought
that
congress
had
the
power
to
take
corrective
actions,
corrective
in
the

that

chief

very
well.
mr.

chief

e.

how
could
this
maintenance
differ
if
it
does
from
the
kind
of
maintenance
that
sometimes
occupancy
that
it
was
required
on
--
chief

warren
e.

is
it
conceptually
the
same
basic
idea
though
--
chief

warren
e.

the
requirement
that
a
man
who
went
out
the
state
got
farms.
chief

e.

the

had
live

many

work
on
it.
chief

warren
e.

understanding
the
difference
in

i
was
wondering
if
what
was
the
difference
in

chief

warren
e.

couldn’t
have
it
--
see
if
i
have
it
clear.
chief

e.

it
opens
it
to
other
claimants?
chief

warren
e.
burger
it
doesn’t
alter
all
the
relationship
with
the

chief

warren
e.

how
did
the

get
his

from

chief

e.
burger
thank
you,
we’ll
recess
now.
mr.

you
may
continue.
chief

warren
e.

what
facts

in
a
hypothetical

that
justice

gave
you,
in

chief

warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
trying
to
put
in
focus
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
generally,
what
metals
are
covered
by
the
mineral
leasing
act?
chief

e.

oil,
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
looking
at
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
exceptions.
then
you
said
that
if
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
could
there
be
two
locators
on
the
same
land?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
have
this
other
situation
you
mentioned?
suppose
someone
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
he
would
oust
the
prior
locator.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
form
are
those
claims
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
in
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hamilton,
taking
it
up
to
the
point
that
justice
black
just
described
in
his
hypothesis.
the
government
--
interior
man
reports
that
there
is
no
valuable
mineral
and
the
claimant
says
there
is
a
valuable
mineral.
chief

warren
e.

where
does
he
contest
the

chief

warren
e.
burger
so
where
do
they
go
from
there?
chief

warren
e.
burger
not
the
state
court
this
time,
is
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
not
waiting
for
him
to
assert
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hamilton.
mr.
strauss,
you
have
8
minutes
i
think.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
public
policy
aspect
involved
in
the
background
at
least
here
to
encourage
the
development
of
this
gone
private
--
by
the
private
sector
rather
than
have
it
either
not
develop
on
the
one
hand
or
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn’t
there
a
difference
between
that
case
and
the
oil
shale
case
--
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
it
just
now
that
we
haven’t
been
able
to
develop
the
processes
of
extracting
oil
from
shale
and
they
have
been
working
on
it
for
50
years,
more
or
less?
chief

e.

but
that’s
all
done
at
a
private

i
take
it,
isn’t
it?
chief

e.

thank
you
mr.
