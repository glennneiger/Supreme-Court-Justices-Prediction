black
how
many
voters
in
that
enclave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
by
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
38.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
other
enclaves
like
that
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
the
state
really
being
injured?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
see
what
this
fight
is
really
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
theoretical
injury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it?
why
is
it
more
than
theory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
trade
over
in
maryland
any?
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
buy
most
of
the
goods
over
there,
groceries
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
live
on
the
enclave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
residences?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
collect
income
tax
from
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
income
tax
and
sales
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
where
really
maryland
is
injured.
it
seems
to
me
like
this
is,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
it's
much
ado
about
nothing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
not
quite
like
aliens
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
you
forbid
them
to
trade
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
large
is
this
enclave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
that
is
why
they
give
them
that
building
--
they
have
to
pay
rent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
something
might
turn
on
what
tests
the
equal
protection
use.
is
it
the
conventional
or
rationality
test?
if
it's
the
compelling
interest
test,
which
the
argument
in
this
court
has
held
flatly
complies
in
voting
cases,
this
case
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
date,
1940?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
first
time
that
it
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
objection
raised
by
maryland,
the
state
of
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
voluntarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
really
be
enough
if
they
live
on
the
enclave?
why
wouldn't
that
give
them
all
they
need
with
reference
to
voting,
if
they've
got
it
from
the
government
which
has
the
enclave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
could,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
they
enforce
a
law
with
reference
to
speeding
in
the
enclaves
for
instance
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
control
does
maryland
have
over
the
enclave,
you
said
all
but
criminal
and
what
does
that
include?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
income
tax
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
can
--
you
do
have
that
much
interest
in
the
election
of
officers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
schools
do
they
attend?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
preschool,
public
schools?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
this
particular
controversy
come
up
and
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1968?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maryland
made
no
effort
to
prevent
that
voting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
how
did
it
happen,
was
there
a
state
law,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
decided
against
people
who
wanted
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
enclave
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
voters
there?
i
wonder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
the
size
where
the
installation
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
maryland
is
not
objecting
to
them
paying
taxes
ever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
difficulty
as
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
didn't
want
them?.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
want
it?
do
i
understand
you
said
they
wanted
the
installation
but
they
didn't
want
them
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
want
it
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
ever
been
any
objection
to
the
installations
being
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
naval
hospital
across
the
street,
an
enclave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
problem
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
that's
true
over
at
aspen?
a
lot
of
them
stay
there
for
years.
justice
