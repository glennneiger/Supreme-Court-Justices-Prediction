mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
not
without
some
regret
that
the
state
of
maryland
arises
this
morning
as
the
appellant
in
this
case
because
we
are
not
without
sympathy
for
the
plight
in
which
the
appellees
have
found
themselves.
they
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america.
they
reside
within
the
geographical
boundaries
of
the
state
of
maryland.
they
pay
certain
taxes
to
the
state
of
maryland
and
most
understandably,
they
are
desirous
of
having
the
right
to
vote.
i
might
also
say
that
where
there’s
a
matter
of
personal
discretion,
for
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
before
the
governor
of
maryland
with
whom
i
have
discussed
this,
we,
out
of
sympathy
will
extend
that
right
to
vote
to
them.
but
we
also
submit
to
the
court,
that
in
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men,
that
this
question
is
one
that
should
not
and
cannot
be
decided
out
of
sympathy
for
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellees’
position
but
it
is
a
question
to
which
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
laws
of
maryland
must
be
applied
and
a
decision
rendered
after
consideration
of
those
laws.
i
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below,
a
district
court
which
we
believe
is
one
of
the
finest
district
courts
in
the
united
states,
notwithstanding
its
occasional
err
as
in
the
instant
case.
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below
was
decided
from
an
overabundance
of
sympathy
for
the
plaintiffs
and
that
that
opinion,
we
respectfully
submit
is
mistaken
in
fact
and
erroneous
in
law.
at
the
outset,
let
me
state
that
appellants
and
appellees
alike
concede
that
the
land
in
question
here
is
that
over
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
the
policy
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
ceding
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
on
any
of
the
many
federal
reservations
scattered
throughout
our
state
to
reserve
to
ourselves
concurrent
jurisdiction,
except
that
reservation
which
has
become
almost
standard,
the
reservation
as
to
serving
process.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
resident
of
a
federal
enclave
over
which
the
united
states
exercised
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction,
whether
those
individuals
were
entitled
to
vote
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
as
recently
as
1963
when
some
residents
of
the
perry
point
naval
hospital
in
cecil
county
in
maryland
applied
for
the
right
to
register,
were
refused
that
right
and
appealed
to
the
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
case,
royer
versus
the
board
of
election
supervisors,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
carefully
considered
the
long
line
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
throughout
this
nation
have
considered
this
same
question
and
after
consideration
of
those
cases
and
after
review
of
what
we
believe
to
be
the
pertinent
federal
law
on
this
question
concluded
that
these
individuals
residing
on
these
reservations
were
not
in
fact
residents
of
the
state
of
maryland.
it
appears
to
us
from
our
study
of
the
law
that
dating
from
almost
--
from
1811
down
to
as
recently
as
six
months
ago
in
new
mexico,
the
courts
throughout
the
united
states
have
held
that
persons
residing
on
federal
reservations
over
which
there
is
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
vested
in
the
congress
by
virtue
of
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution,
those
persons
are
not
residents
of
the
state.
they
are
not
--
do
not
have
the
same
political
right
as
to
the
residents
of
the
state
which
surrounds
them
and
that
the
sovereignty
and
the
authority
and
the
dominion
of
those
states,
of
the
state
surrounding
these
reservations
does
not
exist
over
the
individuals
residing
therein.
in
this
long
line
of
cases
considered
by
the
courts
throughout
the
country,
there
are
but
three
representing
a
minority
view
or
there
were
but
three
representing
a
minority
view
until
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
two
of
those
three
are
not
really
applicable
to
the
case
at
hand
because
one
of
those
involved
a
state
which
had
reserved
to
itself
concurrent
jurisdiction.
another
involved
a
state
which
--
a
state
statute
and
only
one,
the
decision
of
the
--
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
california
followed
the
line
of
reasoning
which
was
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
arguments
which
we
present
today
would
appear
to
be,
the
first
arguments
addressed
to
this
court
on
this
specific
question,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
residents
of
these
enclaves
must
be
granted
the
right
to
vote.
but
the
question
itself
is
not
a
question
of
first
impression
to
this
court.
it
is
not
a
question
of
which
this
court
has
not
taken
notice
on
prior
occasions.
because
the
court
in
surplus
trading
in
1930,
in
holding
that
certain
blankets
in
the
hands
of
a
traitor
on
the
federal
reservation
were
not
subject
to
state
taxation.
this
court,
set
out
at
great
length
in
this
opinion
and
adopted,
we
believe
the
language
of
some
of
the
state
courts
which
had
held
and
quoted
the
language
of
the
state
courts
which
had
held
that
the
residents
of
these
federal
enclaves
were
not
entitled
to
vote,
to
be
treated
for
voting
purposes
like
the
citizens
of
the
states
surrounding
them.
the
district
court
decision
from
which
we
have
appealed
starts
out
by
restating
the
premise
that
where
the
united
states
exercises
this
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
over
land
within
the
state
that
the
persons
residing
thereon
are
not,
are
not
residents
and
need
not
be
granted
the
vote.
then
having,
we
believe,
correctly
stated
the
law,
the
court
goes
on
to
examine
the
so-called
retrocession
statutes,
various
statutes
by
which
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
from
1928
on,
has
purportedly
retroceded
to
the
states
certain
jurisdiction
over
the
inhabitants
of
these
reservations
and
the
court
after
review
of
these
statutes
then
concludes
that
the
united
states
in
fact
having
retroceded
its
jurisdiction
in
what
it
says
is
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
important
matters
of
state
sovereignty
and
authority
that
this
jurisdiction
is
not
exclusively
federal
but
is
concurrent
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
it
being
concurrent
to
state,
the
district
court
said
is
required
to
extend
that
most
precious
right
of
all,
it
says
the
right
to
vote
to
the
petitioners.
we
submit,
your
honor,
first
of
all
that
an
examination
of
these
retrocession
statutes
will
quickly
reveal
that
they
do
not
retrocede
to
the
state
of
maryland
or
to
any
other
state
the
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
state
sovereignty
over
these
areas
nor
do
they
give
to
the
state
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
government
in
the
important
areas
of
sovereignty.
what
do
they
do,
quickly
stated,
one
extends
to
the
residents
of
these
enclaves,
the
benefits
and
the
detriments
of
the
state
of
maryland’s
wrongful
death
statute.
another
extends
to
them
the
benefits
and
the
detriments
of
our
workmen's
compensation
laws
and
of
our
unemployment
insurance
laws,
the
two
that
seem
to
be
a
third
dealt
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
the
lessee’s
interest
in
commercial
properties,
rented
by
the
government
to
entrepreneurs
within
the
reservation.
the
two
retrocession
statutes
that
were
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
was
just
about
to
say,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
two
that
were
of
most
interest
to
the
district
court
were
the
buck
act
and
the
lee
act
which
gave
to
the
states
the
right
to
exact
income
and
sales
taxes,
that's
the
buck
act
and
the
lea
act
which
gave
to
the
states
the
right
to
levy
taxes
on
motor
fuel
sold
in
the
enclave.
these
obviously
were
of
great
interest
to
the
district
court
and
i
submit
to
your
honors,
it
is
because
of
the
application
of
the
buck
act
and
the
application
of
the
lea
act
that
the
district
court
reached
its
conclusion.
the
buck
act
gave
to
the
state
of
maryland
the
right
to
levy
certain
taxes
on
the
residents
of
these
enclaves.
it
gave
the
state
the
right
to
levy
income
taxes
and
it
gave
the
state
the
right
to
levy
sales
and
use
taxes.
further,
the
district
court
noted
that
although
the
state
of
maryland
has
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
to
try
one
situated
in
a
federal
reservation
for
any
crime,
any
criminal
violation
of
the
state
law,
the
district
court
noted
that
the
congress
had
enacted
as
long
ago
as
1825
the
assimilative
crimes
act
and
the
court
says
then,
this
substantially
means
that
the
state
criminal
laws
are
enforced
on
the
reservation
and
it
was
really
because
of
these,
because
we
exact
income
and
sales
taxes
and
because
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
that
i
believe
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
sovereignty
over
these
individuals
as
we
do
our
residents
of
the
state.
and
it
is
in
this,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
say
that
the
court
has
been
mistaken
in
the
facts.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
income
taxes
and
the
sales
taxes
of
any
state
are
levied
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
moneys
which
are
used
for
such
public
projects
as
highways,
schools,
colleges,
libraries
and
we
believe
that
enacting
the
buck
act,
giving
us
the
right
to
impose
sales
and
income
taxes
on
these
residents,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
merely
saying
to
the
state
of
maryland
and
to
the
other
states
that
we
recognize
that
these
individuals
who
were
employed
by
us
within
the
geographical
borders
of
your
states
are
utilizing
certain
state
services
and
we
recognize
the
inequity
of
your
proving
these
services
for
them
without
any
return
on
your
part
and
so
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
passage
of
the
buck
act
was
merely
an
exercise
in
congressional
equity
giving
to
the
state
that
which
the
state
was
already
entitled
from
the
services
which
we
supply
to
the
appellees
and
i
might
also
point
out,
as
the
district
court
did
not,
that
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
enacted
the
buck
act,
they
appended
to
that
act
a
phrase
which
said,
that
nothing
contained
herein
shall
be
held
to
have
surrendered
the
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
exercises
under
article
i,
section
8
over
the
lands
here
in
question.
i
believe
that
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
strongly
persuasive
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
erred
when
it
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
state's
interest
in
this
cause
is
this
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
unjust
and
discriminatory
to
the
other
citizens
of
maryland,
those
who
reside
within
our
geographical
borders
but
off
the
reservation.
it
is
unjust
to
them
to
extend,
for
us
to
extend
the
vote
to
persons
living
on
the
reservation
over
whom
we
have
absolutely
no
sovereignty,
over
whom
we
have
absolutely
no
authority
and
no
dominion,
accepting
that
authority
and
sovereignty
granted
to
us
which
we
hold
at
the
sufferance
of
another
sovereign.
we
can
do
absolutely
nothing
on
this
reservation
and
that's
the
interest,
the
state
interest
in
this
question.
are
we
to
be
required
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
give
the
right
to
vote
to
people
who
are
completely
immune
from
a
state
criminal
prosecution
of
any
kind
while
on
the
land
on
which
they
reside?
the
assimilative
crimes
act
that
my
brother
in
his
brief
says
as
the
district
court,
that
substantially
the
same
end
is
achieved,
that
the
federal
government,
under
the
act
of
1825
and
as
amended
will
enforce
on
the
reservation
the
laws
of
the
state
and
we
say
that
there
is
a
material
difference
between
having
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
enforced
on
that
reservation
by
the
united
states
attorney,
that
first
of
all,
it
means
that
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
decide
whom
it
shall
prosecute.
a
state
prosecuting
officer
does
not
decide,
shall
i
now
process
this
case.
shall
i
step
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
question
but
these
are
the
burdens
of
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
the
traditional
phrase,
thank
you
for
asking
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
the
laws
of
maryland
will
reveal
that
there
are
substantial
burdens
which
are
carried
by
the
people
of
maryland
from
which
the
defendants,
from
which
the
appellees
are
exempted.
first
of
all
and
this
court
will
know
as
students
of
the
law
and
as
men
versed
in
government,
that
a
substantial
body
of
law
of
every
government
is
contained
in
the
regulations
and
rules
of
the
governmental
agencies
aside
from
that
which
appears
on
the
statute
books.
the
persons
living
on
federal
reservations
within
the
state
of
maryland
are
totally
and
completely
exempt
from
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
220
various
agencies,
boards
and
commissions
of
state
government
and
from
an
unknown
number
of
county
governments
in
the
county
or
municipal
governments
in
the
county
in
which
they
are
situation.
now,
are
these
mere
words
or
are
these
matters
of
substance?
let
me,
if
i
may
point
out
several
instances
which
i
believe
will
show
that
this
is
a
question
of
substance.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you,
your
honor.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
may
it
please
the
court.
just
prior
to
luncheon
recess,
mr.
justice
marshall
had
asked
me
what
authority
the
state
could
not
exercise
over
the
residents
of
federal
enclaves.
just
to
hit
the
highlights
of
some
of
that
authority,
i
mentioned
that
they
are
completely
exempt
from
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
220
odd
boards,
agencies
and
commissions
of
the
state
and
of
all
similar
county
agencies
which
means
that
for
example
the
state
of
maryland
is
completely
without
power
to
enforce
within
the
boundaries
of
the
federal
enclave
the
liquor
control
statutes
of
the
state
or
of
the
county.
the
state
of
maryland
is
completely
without
authority
to
enforce
within
the
confines
of
the
enclave
such
state
health
department
regulations
as
those
which
require
compulsory
vaccination
obviously
of
paramount
concern
to
the
health
of
all
in
the
vicinity,
on
or
off
the
enclave.
the
doctors
who
practice
their
profession
on
the
national
institute
of
health
and
the
attorneys
who
practice
there
are
free
to
do
so
without
being
required
to
subject
themselves
for
licensing
or
examination
by
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
or
by
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
and
are
not
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
lawyers
for
example,
not
subject
to
the
rules
and
procedure
laid
down
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
am
aware
of
none,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
they
are
sir
and
i
mentioned
these
merely
to
show
that
these
are
the
areas
over
which
we
have
no
authority.
we
have
no
dominion,
not
that
these
specific
instances
operate
to
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
is
a
total
absence
of
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
on
a
federal
reservation
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
for
violation
of
a
state
regulation
even
with
that
regulatory
measure
has
criminal
sanction
attached
to
it.
so
in
the
instance
that
you
gave,
perhaps,
it
would
fall
within
the
area
of
a
substantial
crime
but
in
the
great
majority
of
regulatory
measures,
even
though
our
statutes
might
provide
that
violations
of
any
of
the
regulations
of
the
health
department
or
the
department
of
natural
resources
amount
to
a
misdemeanor,
if
it
is
in
fact
a
regulatory
agency
and
i
am
citing
the
interdepartmental
report
on
the
status
of
federal
enclaves,
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
you
mean
those,
yes,
under
the
act,
under
the
crimes
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
dispute
and
i
think
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
say
that
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
think
that
again
there
is
a
question
of
law
that
to
which
there
is
no
answer
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
say
that
they
are,
that
the
only
authority
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
because
one,
article
i,
section
8
says
it’s
exclusive
and
two,
that
which
we
exercise,
we
exercise
by
virtue
of
the
federal
congressional
enactment.
we
are
exercising
their
powers
and
not
our
own.
in
that
sense,
it
is
not
concurrent
so
it's
a
question
of
semantics
but
the
powers
we
exercise
are
saved
by
their
sufferance.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it
does,
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
unless
there
is
a
similar
federal
statute
and
if
there
is
a
similar
federal
statute,
then
that
prevails
or
unless
the
state
criminal
statute
is
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
they
do.
but
again
as
i've
mentioned
earlier,
that
in
our
position
is
merely
in
return
for
the
services
which
we
provide
and
with
mention
of
sales
taxes,
let
me
make
one
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
this
particular
enclave,
perhaps
my
brother
could
tell
you,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
38,
my
brother
says.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
oh!
yes,
sir,
there
are
many.
perry
point
naval
hospital
i
mentioned
earlier
and
there
are
the
military
establishments,
the
military
residents
of
which
are
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
state’s
being
injured
in
that
we
are
being
required
to
extend
the
vote
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
persons
living
on
an
area
over
which
we
do
not
have
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
it
is
and
that
is
the
only
theoretical
injury
but
i
think
it
is
more
than
theory.
to
me,
it's
a
basic
and
fundamental
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
because
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
would
assume
that
they
do.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well,
in
some
cases
yes,
on
some
of
the
military
establishments,
of
course
they
would
buy
from
post
exchanges
and
also
on
the
military
base
itself.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
they
live
on
the
enclave.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
now
as
this
question
of
taxation,
may
it
please
the
court
and
it
is
yes,
it
is
certainly
the
buck
act
which
led
the
district
court
to
its
conclusion
in
this
case.
their
theory
being,
you
would
levy
income
taxes
on
them
and
sales
tax
that
substantially
what
you
take
from
other
citizens,
we're
going
to
make
you
give
them
this
right.
and
i
say
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir
by
virtue
of
the
buck
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
number,
yes.
in
principle,
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
is
that
we're
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
district
court
had
said
to
us,
you
must
give
the
right
to
vote
to
aliens
who
are
resident
in
maryland
and
who
pay
income
tax.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
understand
that
they're
not
but
they're
alien
to
maryland
by
a
long
line
of
holdings
of
the
state
courts
and
by
approval
of
this
court
or
by
citation
of
this
court
in
surplus
and
other
cases.
they
are
alien
to
maryland
and
that
they
are
not
residents
of
maryland.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
what
the
buck
act
does
is
say
to
maryland,
you
can
collect
taxes
from
them,
these
specific
taxes,
not
all
taxes,
these
specific
taxes.
it
concludes
as
i
mentioned
earlier
by
saying
this
is
not
to
be
taken
as
the
termination
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
therein.
it's
permitting
us
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i'm
saying
that
we
exercise
all
of
them
only
at
the
sufferance
of
the
federal
context.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
sir.
i
would
not
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no
sir,
i'm
sorry.
then
we
--
our
suggested
solution
to
this
is
the
passage
by
the
congress
of
a
bill
such
as
was
introduced
first
under
president
eisenhower
and
has
been
considered
by
a
succession
of
congresses
which
would
retrocede
to
the
state
all
of
the
jurisdiction
on
these
areas,
all
of
it
which
the
federal
government
does
not
need
for
the
specific
purpose
for
which
they
are
utilizing
these
premises.
then,
then
we
say
we
will
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
not
exclusive
but
concurrent
and
if
it
is
in
fact,
truly
concurrent,
then
i
think
under
the
weight
of
the
cases
throughout
the
united
states,
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
franchise.
but
not
here,
not
where
we
are
not
free
to
apply
our
administrative
law,
not
where
we
are
not
free
to
elect
for
ourselves
will
we
prosecute
or
will
we
forebear
prosecution.
let
me,
because
i
do
not
wan
t--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
size?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
question.
they
are
fully
in
every
sense
citizens.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
know
of
none,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
it's
a
point
that
i
wanted
to
make.
with
all
due
respect
to
these
individual
plaintiffs,
they
have
opted
to
remove
themselves
from
maryland’s
jurisdiction.
they
live
there
by
their
choice
and
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir,
they
have
i
am
sure
comfortable
and
desirable
quarters,
have
reasonable
rentals
close
to
their
place
of
employment.
the
people
who
work
at
the
next
laboratory
desk
next
to
them,
however
and
who
don't
have
those
same
quarters
live
off
the
reservation
and
are
subject
to
all
of
maryland’s
authority
and
to
those,
we
have
freely
given
every
incidence
of
citizenship.
may
i
say
a
word
about
the
question
of
property
taxes?
again
because
the
district
court
and
because
this
court
obviously
is
so
interested
in
the
question
of
taxation,
that
we
do
not
and
cannot
collect
property
taxes
from
these
individuals
on
this.
under
no
circumstances
could
we
assume
the
federal
government
retains
title
to
it.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
sir.
i
fully
understand
it.
but
the
district
court
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
we
collect
income
tax
on
these
residents
and
if
we
collect
sales
tax
from
it,
it
says
therefore
they
pay
their
cost
of
government
and
they
are
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
one
who
lives
off
the
reservation.
they
even
go
on
to
cite
in
there
that
although
they
don't
pay
the
county
taxes
which
are
primarily
real
estate
taxes
that
the
federal
government
through
the
impacted
areas
school
assistance
program
makes
up
the
deficit
through
impacted
area
funds.
i
would
like
the
court
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
not
without
some
regret
that
the
state
of
maryland
arises
this
morning
as
the
appellant
in
this
case
because
we
are
not
without
sympathy
for
the
plight
in
which
the
appellees
have
found
themselves.
they
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america.
they
reside
within
the
geographical
boundaries
of
the
state
of
maryland.
they
pay
certain
taxes
to
the
state
of
maryland
and
most
understandably,
they
are
desirous
of
having
the
right
to
vote.
i
might
also
say
that
where
there’s
a
matter
of
personal
discretion,
for
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
before
the
governor
of
maryland
with
whom
i
have
discussed
this,
we,
out
of
sympathy
will
extend
that
right
to
vote
to
them.
but
we
also
submit
to
the
court,
that
in
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men,
that
this
question
is
one
that
should
not
and
cannot
be
decided
out
of
sympathy
for
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellees’
position
but
it
is
a
question
to
which
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
laws
of
maryland
must
be
applied
and
a
decision
rendered
after
consideration
of
those
laws.
i
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below,
a
district
court
which
we
believe
is
one
of
the
finest
district
courts
in
the
united
states,
notwithstanding
its
occasional
err
as
in
the
instant
case.
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
below
was
decided
from
an
overabundance
of
sympathy
for
the
plaintiffs
and
that
that
opinion,
we
respectfully
submit
is
mistaken
in
fact
and
erroneous
in
law.
at
the
outset,
let
me
state
that
appellants
and
appellees
alike
concede
that
the
land
in
question
here
is
that
over
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
it
was
not
the
policy
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
ceding
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
on
any
of
the
many
federal
reservations
scattered
throughout
our
state
to
reserve
to
ourselves
concurrent
jurisdiction,
except
that
reservation
which
has
become
almost
standard,
the
reservation
as
to
serving
process.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
resident
of
a
federal
enclave
over
which
the
united
states
exercised
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction,
whether
those
individuals
were
entitled
to
vote
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
as
recently
as
1963
when
some
residents
of
the
perry
point
naval
hospital
in
cecil
county
in
maryland
applied
for
the
right
to
register,
were
refused
that
right
and
appealed
to
the
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
case,
royer
versus
the
board
of
election
supervisors,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
carefully
considered
the
long
line
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
throughout
this
nation
have
considered
this
same
question
and
after
consideration
of
those
cases
and
after
review
of
what
we
believe
to
be
the
pertinent
federal
law
on
this
question
concluded
that
these
individuals
residing
on
these
reservations
were
not
in
fact
residents
of
the
state
of
maryland.
it
appears
to
us
from
our
study
of
the
law
that
dating
from
almost
--
from
1811
down
to
as
recently
as
six
months
ago
in
new
mexico,
the
courts
throughout
the
united
states
have
held
that
persons
residing
on
federal
reservations
over
which
there
is
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
vested
in
the
congress
by
virtue
of
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution,
those
persons
are
not
residents
of
the
state.
they
are
not
--
do
not
have
the
same
political
right
as
to
the
residents
of
the
state
which
surrounds
them
and
that
the
sovereignty
and
the
authority
and
the
dominion
of
those
states,
of
the
state
surrounding
these
reservations
does
not
exist
over
the
individuals
residing
therein.
in
this
long
line
of
cases
considered
by
the
courts
throughout
the
country,
there
are
but
three
representing
a
minority
view
or
there
were
but
three
representing
a
minority
view
until
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
two
of
those
three
are
not
really
applicable
to
the
case
at
hand
because
one
of
those
involved
a
state
which
had
reserved
to
itself
concurrent
jurisdiction.
another
involved
a
state
which
--
a
state
statute
and
only
one,
the
decision
of
the
--
an
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
california
followed
the
line
of
reasoning
which
was
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
arguments
which
we
present
today
would
appear
to
be,
the
first
arguments
addressed
to
this
court
on
this
specific
question,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
residents
of
these
enclaves
must
be
granted
the
right
to
vote.
but
the
question
itself
is
not
a
question
of
first
impression
to
this
court.
it
is
not
a
question
of
which
this
court
has
not
taken
notice
on
prior
occasions.
because
the
court
in
surplus
trading
in
1930,
in
holding
that
certain
blankets
in
the
hands
of
a
traitor
on
the
federal
reservation
were
not
subject
to
state
taxation.
this
court,
set
out
at
great
length
in
this
opinion
and
adopted,
we
believe
the
language
of
some
of
the
state
courts
which
had
held
and
quoted
the
language
of
the
state
courts
which
had
held
that
the
residents
of
these
federal
enclaves
were
not
entitled
to
vote,
to
be
treated
for
voting
purposes
like
the
citizens
of
the
states
surrounding
them.
the
district
court
decision
from
which
we
have
appealed
starts
out
by
restating
the
premise
that
where
the
united
states
exercises
this
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
over
land
within
the
state
that
the
persons
residing
thereon
are
not,
are
not
residents
and
need
not
be
granted
the
vote.
then
having,
we
believe,
correctly
stated
the
law,
the
court
goes
on
to
examine
the
so-called
retrocession
statutes,
various
statutes
by
which
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
from
1928
on,
has
purportedly
retroceded
to
the
states
certain
jurisdiction
over
the
inhabitants
of
these
reservations
and
the
court
after
review
of
these
statutes
then
concludes
that
the
united
states
in
fact
having
retroceded
its
jurisdiction
in
what
it
says
is
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
important
matters
of
state
sovereignty
and
authority
that
this
jurisdiction
is
not
exclusively
federal
but
is
concurrent
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
it
being
concurrent
to
state,
the
district
court
said
is
required
to
extend
that
most
precious
right
of
all,
it
says
the
right
to
vote
to
the
petitioners.
we
submit,
your
honor,
first
of
all
that
an
examination
of
these
retrocession
statutes
will
quickly
reveal
that
they
do
not
retrocede
to
the
state
of
maryland
or
to
any
other
state
the
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
state
sovereignty
over
these
areas
nor
do
they
give
to
the
state
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
government
in
the
important
areas
of
sovereignty.
what
do
they
do,
quickly
stated,
one
extends
to
the
residents
of
these
enclaves,
the
benefits
and
the
detriments
of
the
state
of
maryland’s
wrongful
death
statute.
another
extends
to
them
the
benefits
and
the
detriments
of
our
workmen's
compensation
laws
and
of
our
unemployment
insurance
laws,
the
two
that
seem
to
be
a
third
dealt
with
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
the
lessee’s
interest
in
commercial
properties,
rented
by
the
government
to
entrepreneurs
within
the
reservation.
the
two
retrocession
statutes
that
were
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
was
just
about
to
say,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
two
that
were
of
most
interest
to
the
district
court
were
the
buck
act
and
the
lee
act
which
gave
to
the
states
the
right
to
exact
income
and
sales
taxes,
that's
the
buck
act
and
the
lea
act
which
gave
to
the
states
the
right
to
levy
taxes
on
motor
fuel
sold
in
the
enclave.
these
obviously
were
of
great
interest
to
the
district
court
and
i
submit
to
your
honors,
it
is
because
of
the
application
of
the
buck
act
and
the
application
of
the
lea
act
that
the
district
court
reached
its
conclusion.
the
buck
act
gave
to
the
state
of
maryland
the
right
to
levy
certain
taxes
on
the
residents
of
these
enclaves.
it
gave
the
state
the
right
to
levy
income
taxes
and
it
gave
the
state
the
right
to
levy
sales
and
use
taxes.
further,
the
district
court
noted
that
although
the
state
of
maryland
has
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
to
try
one
situated
in
a
federal
reservation
for
any
crime,
any
criminal
violation
of
the
state
law,
the
district
court
noted
that
the
congress
had
enacted
as
long
ago
as
1825
the
assimilative
crimes
act
and
the
court
says
then,
this
substantially
means
that
the
state
criminal
laws
are
enforced
on
the
reservation
and
it
was
really
because
of
these,
because
we
exact
income
and
sales
taxes
and
because
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
that
i
believe
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
sovereignty
over
these
individuals
as
we
do
our
residents
of
the
state.
and
it
is
in
this,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
say
that
the
court
has
been
mistaken
in
the
facts.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
income
taxes
and
the
sales
taxes
of
any
state
are
levied
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
moneys
which
are
used
for
such
public
projects
as
highways,
schools,
colleges,
libraries
and
we
believe
that
enacting
the
buck
act,
giving
us
the
right
to
impose
sales
and
income
taxes
on
these
residents,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
merely
saying
to
the
state
of
maryland
and
to
the
other
states
that
we
recognize
that
these
individuals
who
were
employed
by
us
within
the
geographical
borders
of
your
states
are
utilizing
certain
state
services
and
we
recognize
the
inequity
of
your
proving
these
services
for
them
without
any
return
on
your
part
and
so
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
passage
of
the
buck
act
was
merely
an
exercise
in
congressional
equity
giving
to
the
state
that
which
the
state
was
already
entitled
from
the
services
which
we
supply
to
the
appellees
and
i
might
also
point
out,
as
the
district
court
did
not,
that
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
enacted
the
buck
act,
they
appended
to
that
act
a
phrase
which
said,
that
nothing
contained
herein
shall
be
held
to
have
surrendered
the
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
exercises
under
article
i,
section
8
over
the
lands
here
in
question.
i
believe
that
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
strongly
persuasive
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
erred
when
it
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
state's
interest
in
this
cause
is
this
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
unjust
and
discriminatory
to
the
other
citizens
of
maryland,
those
who
reside
within
our
geographical
borders
but
off
the
reservation.
it
is
unjust
to
them
to
extend,
for
us
to
extend
the
vote
to
persons
living
on
the
reservation
over
whom
we
have
absolutely
no
sovereignty,
over
whom
we
have
absolutely
no
authority
and
no
dominion,
accepting
that
authority
and
sovereignty
granted
to
us
which
we
hold
at
the
sufferance
of
another
sovereign.
we
can
do
absolutely
nothing
on
this
reservation
and
that's
the
interest,
the
state
interest
in
this
question.
are
we
to
be
required
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
give
the
right
to
vote
to
people
who
are
completely
immune
from
a
state
criminal
prosecution
of
any
kind
while
on
the
land
on
which
they
reside?
the
assimilative
crimes
act
that
my
brother
in
his
brief
says
as
the
district
court,
that
substantially
the
same
end
is
achieved,
that
the
federal
government,
under
the
act
of
1825
and
as
amended
will
enforce
on
the
reservation
the
laws
of
the
state
and
we
say
that
there
is
a
material
difference
between
having
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
enforced
on
that
reservation
by
the
united
states
attorney,
that
first
of
all,
it
means
that
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
decide
whom
it
shall
prosecute.
a
state
prosecuting
officer
does
not
decide,
shall
i
now
process
this
case.
shall
i
step
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
question
but
these
are
the
burdens
of
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
the
traditional
phrase,
thank
you
for
asking
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
believe
that
an
examination
of
the
laws
of
maryland
will
reveal
that
there
are
substantial
burdens
which
are
carried
by
the
people
of
maryland
from
which
the
defendants,
from
which
the
appellees
are
exempted.
first
of
all
and
this
court
will
know
as
students
of
the
law
and
as
men
versed
in
government,
that
a
substantial
body
of
law
of
every
government
is
contained
in
the
regulations
and
rules
of
the
governmental
agencies
aside
from
that
which
appears
on
the
statute
books.
the
persons
living
on
federal
reservations
within
the
state
of
maryland
are
totally
and
completely
exempt
from
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
220
various
agencies,
boards
and
commissions
of
state
government
and
from
an
unknown
number
of
county
governments
in
the
county
or
municipal
governments
in
the
county
in
which
they
are
situation.
now,
are
these
mere
words
or
are
these
matters
of
substance?
let
me,
if
i
may
point
out
several
instances
which
i
believe
will
show
that
this
is
a
question
of
substance.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you,
your
honor.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
may
it
please
the
court.
just
prior
to
luncheon
recess,
mr.
justice
marshall
had
asked
me
what
authority
the
state
could
not
exercise
over
the
residents
of
federal
enclaves.
just
to
hit
the
highlights
of
some
of
that
authority,
i
mentioned
that
they
are
completely
exempt
from
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
220
odd
boards,
agencies
and
commissions
of
the
state
and
of
all
similar
county
agencies
which
means
that
for
example
the
state
of
maryland
is
completely
without
power
to
enforce
within
the
boundaries
of
the
federal
enclave
the
liquor
control
statutes
of
the
state
or
of
the
county.
the
state
of
maryland
is
completely
without
authority
to
enforce
within
the
confines
of
the
enclave
such
state
health
department
regulations
as
those
which
require
compulsory
vaccination
obviously
of
paramount
concern
to
the
health
of
all
in
the
vicinity,
on
or
off
the
enclave.
the
doctors
who
practice
their
profession
on
the
national
institute
of
health
and
the
attorneys
who
practice
there
are
free
to
do
so
without
being
required
to
subject
themselves
for
licensing
or
examination
by
the
state
board
of
medical
examiners
or
by
the
state
board
of
law
examiners
and
are
not
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
lawyers
for
example,
not
subject
to
the
rules
and
procedure
laid
down
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
am
aware
of
none,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
they
are
sir
and
i
mentioned
these
merely
to
show
that
these
are
the
areas
over
which
we
have
no
authority.
we
have
no
dominion,
not
that
these
specific
instances
operate
to
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
is
a
total
absence
of
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
on
a
federal
reservation
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
for
violation
of
a
state
regulation
even
with
that
regulatory
measure
has
criminal
sanction
attached
to
it.
so
in
the
instance
that
you
gave,
perhaps,
it
would
fall
within
the
area
of
a
substantial
crime
but
in
the
great
majority
of
regulatory
measures,
even
though
our
statutes
might
provide
that
violations
of
any
of
the
regulations
of
the
health
department
or
the
department
of
natural
resources
amount
to
a
misdemeanor,
if
it
is
in
fact
a
regulatory
agency
and
i
am
citing
the
interdepartmental
report
on
the
status
of
federal
enclaves,
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
you
mean
those,
yes,
under
the
act,
under
the
crimes
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
dispute
and
i
think
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
say
that
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
think
that
again
there
is
a
question
of
law
that
to
which
there
is
no
answer
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
say
that
they
are,
that
the
only
authority
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
because
one,
article
i,
section
8
says
it’s
exclusive
and
two,
that
which
we
exercise,
we
exercise
by
virtue
of
the
federal
congressional
enactment.
we
are
exercising
their
powers
and
not
our
own.
in
that
sense,
it
is
not
concurrent
so
it's
a
question
of
semantics
but
the
powers
we
exercise
are
saved
by
their
sufferance.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it
does,
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
unless
there
is
a
similar
federal
statute
and
if
there
is
a
similar
federal
statute,
then
that
prevails
or
unless
the
state
criminal
statute
is
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
they
do.
but
again
as
i've
mentioned
earlier,
that
in
our
position
is
merely
in
return
for
the
services
which
we
provide
and
with
mention
of
sales
taxes,
let
me
make
one
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
this
particular
enclave,
perhaps
my
brother
could
tell
you,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
38,
my
brother
says.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
oh!
yes,
sir,
there
are
many.
perry
point
naval
hospital
i
mentioned
earlier
and
there
are
the
military
establishments,
the
military
residents
of
which
are
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
state’s
being
injured
in
that
we
are
being
required
to
extend
the
vote
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
persons
living
on
an
area
over
which
we
do
not
have
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
it
is
and
that
is
the
only
theoretical
injury
but
i
think
it
is
more
than
theory.
to
me,
it's
a
basic
and
fundamental
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
because
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
would
assume
that
they
do.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well,
in
some
cases
yes,
on
some
of
the
military
establishments,
of
course
they
would
buy
from
post
exchanges
and
also
on
the
military
base
itself.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
they
live
on
the
enclave.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
now
as
this
question
of
taxation,
may
it
please
the
court
and
it
is
yes,
it
is
certainly
the
buck
act
which
led
the
district
court
to
its
conclusion
in
this
case.
their
theory
being,
you
would
levy
income
taxes
on
them
and
sales
tax
that
substantially
what
you
take
from
other
citizens,
we're
going
to
make
you
give
them
this
right.
and
i
say
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir
by
virtue
of
the
buck
act.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
number,
yes.
in
principle,
may
it
please
the
court,
our
position
is
that
we're
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
if
the
district
court
had
said
to
us,
you
must
give
the
right
to
vote
to
aliens
who
are
resident
in
maryland
and
who
pay
income
tax.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
understand
that
they're
not
but
they're
alien
to
maryland
by
a
long
line
of
holdings
of
the
state
courts
and
by
approval
of
this
court
or
by
citation
of
this
court
in
surplus
and
other
cases.
they
are
alien
to
maryland
and
that
they
are
not
residents
of
maryland.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
what
the
buck
act
does
is
say
to
maryland,
you
can
collect
taxes
from
them,
these
specific
taxes,
not
all
taxes,
these
specific
taxes.
it
concludes
as
i
mentioned
earlier
by
saying
this
is
not
to
be
taken
as
the
termination
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
therein.
it's
permitting
us
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i'm
saying
that
we
exercise
all
of
them
only
at
the
sufferance
of
the
federal
context.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
sir.
i
would
not
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no
sir,
i'm
sorry.
then
we
--
our
suggested
solution
to
this
is
the
passage
by
the
congress
of
a
bill
such
as
was
introduced
first
under
president
eisenhower
and
has
been
considered
by
a
succession
of
congresses
which
would
retrocede
to
the
state
all
of
the
jurisdiction
on
these
areas,
all
of
it
which
the
federal
government
does
not
need
for
the
specific
purpose
for
which
they
are
utilizing
these
premises.
then,
then
we
say
we
will
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
not
exclusive
but
concurrent
and
if
it
is
in
fact,
truly
concurrent,
then
i
think
under
the
weight
of
the
cases
throughout
the
united
states,
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
franchise.
but
not
here,
not
where
we
are
not
free
to
apply
our
administrative
law,
not
where
we
are
not
free
to
elect
for
ourselves
will
we
prosecute
or
will
we
forebear
prosecution.
let
me,
because
i
do
not
wan
t--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
size?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
beyond
question.
they
are
fully
in
every
sense
citizens.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
know
of
none,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
it's
a
point
that
i
wanted
to
make.
with
all
due
respect
to
these
individual
plaintiffs,
they
have
opted
to
remove
themselves
from
maryland’s
jurisdiction.
they
live
there
by
their
choice
and
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir,
they
have
i
am
sure
comfortable
and
desirable
quarters,
have
reasonable
rentals
close
to
their
place
of
employment.
the
people
who
work
at
the
next
laboratory
desk
next
to
them,
however
and
who
don't
have
those
same
quarters
live
off
the
reservation
and
are
subject
to
all
of
maryland’s
authority
and
to
those,
we
have
freely
given
every
incidence
of
citizenship.
may
i
say
a
word
about
the
question
of
property
taxes?
again
because
the
district
court
and
because
this
court
obviously
is
so
interested
in
the
question
of
taxation,
that
we
do
not
and
cannot
collect
property
taxes
from
these
individuals
on
this.
under
no
circumstances
could
we
assume
the
federal
government
retains
title
to
it.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
sir.
i
fully
understand
it.
but
the
district
court
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
we
collect
income
tax
on
these
residents
and
if
we
collect
sales
tax
from
it,
it
says
therefore
they
pay
their
cost
of
government
and
they
are
in
substantially
the
same
position
as
one
who
lives
off
the
reservation.
they
even
go
on
to
cite
in
there
that
although
they
don't
pay
the
county
taxes
which
are
primarily
real
estate
taxes
that
the
federal
government
through
the
impacted
areas
school
assistance
program
makes
up
the
deficit
through
impacted
area
funds.
i
would
like
the
court
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
