mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
as
focused
on
very
early
in
the
argument
by
justice
harlan
is
the
contention
of
the
plaintiffs
that
the
action
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
classifying
these
plaintiffs
as
nonresidents
of
the
state
constitutes
an
arbitrary
unreasonable
classification
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
equal
protection.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe,
your
honor
that
we
can
assert
our
right
on
both
tests
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
us
that
it
might
be
usable
for
us
to
focus
on
the
specific
facts
surrounding
the
acquisition
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
united
states
over
the
track
of
an
issue
here.
the
track
in
which
we
are
dealing
is
a
track
lying
in
montgomery
county
to
which
the
united
states
acquired
title
in
the
1930s
and
then
built
national
institutes
of
health
on
them.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
moved
on
to
the
track
in
the
1940s,
became
registered
voters,
some
around
1950
and
later.
others
moved
onto
the
track
in
the
1950s.
it
was
only
in
1953
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
maryland
ceded
jurisdiction
and
thus
created
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
right
of
the
united
states
to
this
area
under
the
forts
and
dock-yards
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
schifter
1953.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
mr.
justice
black.
what
happened
here
was
the
united
states
first
acquired
title
and
only
years
later
in
1953,
did
the
state
of
maryland
cede
jurisdiction
and
thus
vest
in
the
united
states
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
claim
under
clause
17,
section
8,
article
i.
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
it
did
not.
the
state
of
maryland,
in
1953
ceded
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
voluntarily.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor,
the
united
states
can
do
that.
the
contention
of
the
state
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
schifter
your
honor,
the
united
states,
however,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
not
done
so.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh!
yes,
they
could.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
harlan,
under
--
as
far
as
the
house
of
representatives
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
this
particular
right
could
be
said
to
be
vested
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
would
not
be
the
case
perhaps
with
regard
to
other
offices.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
would
be
the
same
difficulty
issue.
i
think
with
regard
to
house
of
representatives,
it
would
be
most--
mr.
richard
schifter
constitute?
no,
certainly
not.
and
that
therefore
can
only
be
done
by
asserting
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
position
of
the
state
of
maryland
is
basically
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
geographic
area
which
is
not
part
of
the
state
of
maryland,
the
doctrine
of
extraterritoriality
which
was
first
enunciated
by
the
state
courts
in
the
19th
century
particularly
by
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
1841
in
the
opinion
of
the
justices
and
thereafter
in
sinks
versus
reese,
1869
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
it
is
very
significant
to
note
that
at
both
instances
in
the
case
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
again
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
the
residents
of
the
enclave,
as
they
existed
then,
had
no
obligations
whatever
toward
the
states
in
question,
massachusetts
and
ohio
and
both
courts,
placed
the
thrust
of
the
decisions
of
the
decision
of
both
of
these
courts
was
that
because
there
was
no
obligation
owed
by
an
enclave
resident
to
the
state,
it
was
for
that
reason
that
there
was
no
concurrent
or
no
right
arising
out
of
it
to
vote
in
that
particular
state.
as
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
in
this
particular
case
pointed
out,
the
situation
was
abruptly
changed
when
a
federal
government
in
the
late
1920s
and
30s,
enacted
a
series
of
statues
which
in
effect
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
maryland
over
the
enclave
and
enclave
residents
for
practically
all
purposes
other
than
criminal
jurisdiction
and
this
is
really
what
we
are
down
to.
it
is
only
as
far
as
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
is
concerned
that
there
is
a
continuing,
exclusive
authority
vested
in
the
united
states
government
for
all
the
rest
of
it
in
terms
of
the
daily
lives
of
the
residents
of
the
enclaves.
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
in
every
other
way
subject
to
the
laws
and
duties
of
citizens
of
maryland.
mr.
richard
schifter
if
that
would
be
done,
mr.
justice
black
by
the
--
in
the
united
states
courts
by
the
commissioners.
mr.
richard
schifter
by
united
states
commissioners.
in
other
words,
the
speeding
law
would
be
enforced
--
mr.
richard
schifter
taxation,
as
far
as
all
taxes
to
which
these
people
would
be
subject
if
they
were
not
living
on
the
enclave.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
income
tax,
sales
tax,
motor
vehicle
tax
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
i
wish
to
point
out
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiffs
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
for
all
offices
from
president
of
the
united
states
on
down
to
local
members
of
the
board
of
education.
and
in
each
of
these
offices,
save
one,
these
residents
have
a
very
deep
interest.
mr.
richard
schifter
we
have,
your
honor,
the
record
only
shows
which
of
the
plaintiffs
have
children
and
that
they
did
attend
schools.
mr.
richard
schifter
schools
of
montgomery
county,
maryland.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
public
schools
of
montgomery
county.
the
record
points
out
quite
a
number
of
the
plaintiffs
were
members
of
the
ptas
of
montgomery
country,
that
in
every
other
way,
they
were
part
of
the
montgomery
county
community
and
i
wish
to
point
out
that
prior
to
1953,
the
issues
as
to
whether
they
are
or
are
not
members
of
the
montgomery
county
really
could
not
even
have
been
raised.
it
was
simply
that
the
state
law
ceding
jurisdiction
in
1953,
simply
drew
a
line
along
wisconsin
avenue
and
old
georgetown
road
which
said
from
here
on
end,
there
shall
be
no
criminal
jurisdiction
by
the
state
of
maryland
over
this
particular
area.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
came
up
in
1968,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes
and
it
developed
in
the
following
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right
until
1968.
mr.
richard
schifter
what
happened
was
the
following,
the
residents
of
another
enclave
in
cecil
county,
maryland,
had
been
prevented
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
elections
of
their
country
from
voting.
they
went
into
the
maryland
courts
and
in
1963,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
the
royer
case
decided
against
them.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
that
was
perry
point
naval
hospital,
veterans
hospital,
perry
point
in
cecil
country.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
a
small
number.
mr.
richard
schifter
250
i
am
told.
it
took,
mr.
justice
black,
about
five
years
before
the
news
of
the
royer
case
somehow
got
down
to
the
board
of
election
supervisors
in
montgomery
country
and
beginning
early
1968
they
decided
to
turn
people
down
if
they
tried
to
register
to
vote
if
they
were
residents
of
the
nih
enclave
and
in
the
months
following
when
the
point
--
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
it
did
not
and
it
has
been
collecting
taxes
all
along.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
has
been
and
it
has
failed.
it
also,
it
was
proposed
as
a
provision
of
the
--
proposed
new
constitution
in
the
state
of
maryland
voted
on
in
1968
and
the
proposed
new
constitution
failed
too.
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record.
i
think
i
have
an
idea
as
to
why
there
is
some
difficult
as
to
why
it's
going
through
them.
mr.
richard
schifter
why
the
legislation
is
not
going
through.
i
believe
the
delegation
of
ann
arundel
county
has
some
doubts
about
military
installations
in
that
particular
county.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
i
believe
that
is
a
case.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
didn't
want
the
military
installation
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
an
explanation
however
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
they
are
dealing
among
other
things
with
the
naval
academy,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
would
not
want
the
residents
of
these
military
installations
to
be
voting
at
anne
arundel
county.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
don't
think
so.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
--
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
press
home
here
is
that
that
is
not
the
point
that
we
are
making.
the
state
of
maryland
retains
the
full
power
to
define
residents
in
terms
of
the
bona
fides
of
a
particular
persons
living
in
a
particular
locality.
in
the
case
of
an
annapolis
for
example,
the
state
of
maryland
could
perfectly
well
hold
that
a
midshipman
entering
the
academy
for
four
years
is
not
a
bona
fide
resident
of
maryland.
however,
a
member
of
the
faculty
who
plans
to
spend
his
entire
life
there
and
lives
on
the
enclave
should
be
considered
a
permanent
resident
of
maryland.
the
same
is
true
at
fort
meade,
somebody
who
is
there
on
a
temporary
tour
of
duty
can
very
well
be
denied
his
right
to
vote
but
somebody
who
again
is
there,
as
part
of
the
permanent
cadre
should
have
a
right
to
vote
in
the
state
of
maryland.
so
the
distinction
can
still
be
made,
the
issue
that
is
raised
here
is
whether
a
person
living
in
a
particular
locality
and
planning
to
live
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
should
be
deprived
forever
of
his
right
to
vote
as
long
as
he
chooses
to
live
at
that
particular
locality
even
though
he
is
paying
taxes
to
the
state
and
is
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
also
subject
to
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
through
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
the
only
issue,
the
only
point
of
distinction
as
i
have
mentioned
before
is
the
point
of
distinction
with
regard
to
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
and
to
return
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
would
say
that
if
the
state
were
to
provide
that
residents
of
the
enclaves
may
not
vote
for
a
state’s
attorney
montgomery
count,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
a
rational
reason
for
depriving
them
of
that
right
to
vote
because
a
state's
attorney
of
montgomery
county
does
indeed
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
enclave.
but
every
other
officer
of
government
for
whom
these
residents
may
not
vote
under
the
theory
of
the
other
state,
is
a
person
in
whom,
in
whose
services
have
a
vital
interest.
mr.
richard
schifter
no
he
does
not.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
does
but
it
is
enforced
by
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
schifter
not
in
assimilative
crimes
act.
this
is
why
he
is
the
only
person
that
has
no
jurisdiction
over
them
at
their
place
of
residence.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
that
this
would
be
done
as
far
as
the
civil
action
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
it
is
a
crime
to
falsify
your
return,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
enforcement
i
would
assume
would
still
be
vested
in
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
i
cannot
find
any
way
out
of
that.
the
states
attorney
just
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
u.s.
attorney
would
have
to
proceed
in
terms
of
enforcing
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
it
would
arise
there.
in
the
case
of
military
personnel
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
we
do
not
and
the
point
is
that
in
case
of
military
personnel,
the
issue
arises
much
less
because
they
vote
back
home
in
their
permanent
place
of
residence.
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
who
have
made
their
home
there
for
decades
and
who
plan
to
stay
there
for
good.
mr.
richard
schifter
there
still
would
be
a
tour
of
duty
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
schifter
i
am
not
sure
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suppose
they
do.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
some
live
there
and
others
may
live
in
homes
on
the
reservation
off
the
enclave.
with
regard
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
absence
of
criminal
jurisdiction
can
deprive
a
voter
or
a
resident
of
a
particular
locality
of
the
right
to
vote
as
to
place
of
residence,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
analogy
in
the
cases
involving
american
indians
who
though
they
live
in
indian
reservations
are
and
are
not
under
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
states
in
most
instances,
do
have
the
right
to
vote
under
the
various
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court
since
1948.
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
decisions
both
in
arizona
and
new
mexico
on
this
particular
question.
the
issue
in
that
instance
is
the
same
one
that
arises
here
that
in
the
absence
of
criminal
jurisdiction
of
a
state
over
the
people
living
on
the
reservation,
the
right
to
vote
can
nevertheless
not
be
denied.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
mr.
justice
white,
they
cannot.
they
would
have
to
proceed
through
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
that
this
is
inherent
in
the
right
of
--
in
the
fact
that
the
united
states
has
--
starts
out
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
schifter
civil
proceedings
i
would
assume
could
be
initiated
in
a
certain
court
of
montgomery
country,
maryland
against
the
violators
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
they
can.
since
the
very
beginning
of
the
experience
under
the
forts
and
dock-yard
clause,
an
exemption
has
always
been
written
into--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
both
civil
and
criminal.
this
goes
back
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
all
that
can
be
done
and
has
been
--
that
was
something
that
started
way
back
early
19th
century.
mr.
richard
schifter
no.
mr.
richard
schifter
this
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
a
circular
argument
--
mr.
richard
schifter
may
i
just
explain.
the
new
state
law
provides
that
jurors
shall
be
drawn
from
listed
registered
voters.
mr.
richard
schifter
and
if
they
aren't
on
the
list
then
they
will
be
--
can't
be
jurors.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
that
we
are
dealing
in
that
particular
situation
with
a
no
man's
land,
will
be
very
well
be
true.
some
of
--
we
have
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
real
factors
involving
people's
lives,
on
a
day
to
day
basis,
we're
dealing
here
fundamentally
with
the
point
that
the
residents
of
enclaves
pay
the
taxes
that
all
other
residents
of
maryland
similarly
situated
pay
and
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
that
other
residents
of
the
state
of
maryland
are
in
terms
of
again,
the
daily
life
that
the
average
resident
of
any
part
of
the
united
states
participates
in.
the
only
opportunity
that
these
people
have
to
vote
is
to
vote
as
residents
of
the
enclave.
if
they
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
voting
on
the
enclave,
they
are
totally
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
voting
anywhere.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
as
focused
on
very
early
in
the
argument
by
justice
harlan
is
the
contention
of
the
plaintiffs
that
the
action
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
classifying
these
plaintiffs
as
nonresidents
of
the
state
constitutes
an
arbitrary
unreasonable
classification
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
equal
protection.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe,
your
honor
that
we
can
assert
our
right
on
both
tests
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
us
that
it
might
be
usable
for
us
to
focus
on
the
specific
facts
surrounding
the
acquisition
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
united
states
over
the
track
of
an
issue
here.
the
track
in
which
we
are
dealing
is
a
track
lying
in
montgomery
county
to
which
the
united
states
acquired
title
in
the
1930s
and
then
built
national
institutes
of
health
on
them.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
moved
on
to
the
track
in
the
1940s,
became
registered
voters,
some
around
1950
and
later.
others
moved
onto
the
track
in
the
1950s.
it
was
only
in
1953
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
maryland
ceded
jurisdiction
and
thus
created
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
right
of
the
united
states
to
this
area
under
the
forts
and
dock-yards
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
schifter
1953.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
mr.
justice
black.
what
happened
here
was
the
united
states
first
acquired
title
and
only
years
later
in
1953,
did
the
state
of
maryland
cede
jurisdiction
and
thus
vest
in
the
united
states
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
claim
under
clause
17,
section
8,
article
i.
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
it
did
not.
the
state
of
maryland,
in
1953
ceded
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
voluntarily.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
your
honor,
the
united
states
can
do
that.
the
contention
of
the
state
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
schifter
your
honor,
the
united
states,
however,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
not
done
so.
mr.
richard
schifter
oh!
yes,
they
could.
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
justice
harlan,
under
--
as
far
as
the
house
of
representatives
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
this
particular
right
could
be
said
to
be
vested
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
would
not
be
the
case
perhaps
with
regard
to
other
offices.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
would
be
the
same
difficulty
issue.
i
think
with
regard
to
house
of
representatives,
it
would
be
most--
mr.
richard
schifter
constitute?
no,
certainly
not.
and
that
therefore
can
only
be
done
by
asserting
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
position
of
the
state
of
maryland
is
basically
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
geographic
area
which
is
not
part
of
the
state
of
maryland,
the
doctrine
of
extraterritoriality
which
was
first
enunciated
by
the
state
courts
in
the
19th
century
particularly
by
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
1841
in
the
opinion
of
the
justices
and
thereafter
in
sinks
versus
reese,
1869
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
it
is
very
significant
to
note
that
at
both
instances
in
the
case
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
again
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
fact
that
the
residents
of
the
enclave,
as
they
existed
then,
had
no
obligations
whatever
toward
the
states
in
question,
massachusetts
and
ohio
and
both
courts,
placed
the
thrust
of
the
decisions
of
the
decision
of
both
of
these
courts
was
that
because
there
was
no
obligation
owed
by
an
enclave
resident
to
the
state,
it
was
for
that
reason
that
there
was
no
concurrent
or
no
right
arising
out
of
it
to
vote
in
that
particular
state.
as
the
district
court,
three-judge
court
in
this
particular
case
pointed
out,
the
situation
was
abruptly
changed
when
a
federal
government
in
the
late
1920s
and
30s,
enacted
a
series
of
statues
which
in
effect
extended
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
maryland
over
the
enclave
and
enclave
residents
for
practically
all
purposes
other
than
criminal
jurisdiction
and
this
is
really
what
we
are
down
to.
it
is
only
as
far
as
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
is
concerned
that
there
is
a
continuing,
exclusive
authority
vested
in
the
united
states
government
for
all
the
rest
of
it
in
terms
of
the
daily
lives
of
the
residents
of
the
enclaves.
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
in
every
other
way
subject
to
the
laws
and
duties
of
citizens
of
maryland.
mr.
richard
schifter
if
that
would
be
done,
mr.
justice
black
by
the
--
in
the
united
states
courts
by
the
commissioners.
mr.
richard
schifter
by
united
states
commissioners.
in
other
words,
the
speeding
law
would
be
enforced
--
mr.
richard
schifter
taxation,
as
far
as
all
taxes
to
which
these
people
would
be
subject
if
they
were
not
living
on
the
enclave.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right,
income
tax,
sales
tax,
motor
vehicle
tax
and
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
i
wish
to
point
out
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiffs
are
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
for
all
offices
from
president
of
the
united
states
on
down
to
local
members
of
the
board
of
education.
and
in
each
of
these
offices,
save
one,
these
residents
have
a
very
deep
interest.
mr.
richard
schifter
we
have,
your
honor,
the
record
only
shows
which
of
the
plaintiffs
have
children
and
that
they
did
attend
schools.
mr.
richard
schifter
schools
of
montgomery
county,
maryland.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
public
schools
of
montgomery
county.
the
record
points
out
quite
a
number
of
the
plaintiffs
were
members
of
the
ptas
of
montgomery
country,
that
in
every
other
way,
they
were
part
of
the
montgomery
county
community
and
i
wish
to
point
out
that
prior
to
1953,
the
issues
as
to
whether
they
are
or
are
not
members
of
the
montgomery
county
really
could
not
even
have
been
raised.
it
was
simply
that
the
state
law
ceding
jurisdiction
in
1953,
simply
drew
a
line
along
wisconsin
avenue
and
old
georgetown
road
which
said
from
here
on
end,
there
shall
be
no
criminal
jurisdiction
by
the
state
of
maryland
over
this
particular
area.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
came
up
in
1968,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes
and
it
developed
in
the
following
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right
until
1968.
mr.
richard
schifter
what
happened
was
the
following,
the
residents
of
another
enclave
in
cecil
county,
maryland,
had
been
prevented
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
elections
of
their
country
from
voting.
they
went
into
the
maryland
courts
and
in
1963,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
the
royer
case
decided
against
them.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
mr.
richard
schifter
that
was
perry
point
naval
hospital,
veterans
hospital,
perry
point
in
cecil
country.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
a
small
number.
mr.
richard
schifter
250
i
am
told.
it
took,
mr.
justice
black,
about
five
years
before
the
news
of
the
royer
case
somehow
got
down
to
the
board
of
election
supervisors
in
montgomery
country
and
beginning
early
1968
they
decided
to
turn
people
down
if
they
tried
to
register
to
vote
if
they
were
residents
of
the
nih
enclave
and
in
the
months
following
when
the
point
--
mr.
richard
schifter
no,
it
did
not
and
it
has
been
collecting
taxes
all
along.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
has
been
and
it
has
failed.
it
also,
it
was
proposed
as
a
provision
of
the
--
proposed
new
constitution
in
the
state
of
maryland
voted
on
in
1968
and
the
proposed
new
constitution
failed
too.
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record.
i
think
i
have
an
idea
as
to
why
there
is
some
difficult
as
to
why
it's
going
through
them.
mr.
richard
schifter
why
the
legislation
is
not
going
through.
i
believe
the
delegation
of
ann
arundel
county
has
some
doubts
about
military
installations
in
that
particular
county.
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
i
believe
that
is
a
case.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
didn't
want
the
military
installation
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
an
explanation
however
--
mr.
richard
schifter
that's
right.
they
are
dealing
among
other
things
with
the
naval
academy,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
schifter
they
would
not
want
the
residents
of
these
military
installations
to
be
voting
at
anne
arundel
county.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
don't
think
so.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
--
mr.
richard
schifter
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
press
home
here
is
that
that
is
not
the
point
that
we
are
making.
the
state
of
maryland
retains
the
full
power
to
define
residents
in
terms
of
the
bona
fides
of
a
particular
persons
living
in
a
particular
locality.
in
the
case
of
an
annapolis
for
example,
the
state
of
maryland
could
perfectly
well
hold
that
a
midshipman
entering
the
academy
for
four
years
is
not
a
bona
fide
resident
of
maryland.
however,
a
member
of
the
faculty
who
plans
to
spend
his
entire
life
there
and
lives
on
the
enclave
should
be
considered
a
permanent
resident
of
maryland.
the
same
is
true
at
fort
meade,
somebody
who
is
there
on
a
temporary
tour
of
duty
can
very
well
be
denied
his
right
to
vote
but
somebody
who
again
is
there,
as
part
of
the
permanent
cadre
should
have
a
right
to
vote
in
the
state
of
maryland.
so
the
distinction
can
still
be
made,
the
issue
that
is
raised
here
is
whether
a
person
living
in
a
particular
locality
and
planning
to
live
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
should
be
deprived
forever
of
his
right
to
vote
as
long
as
he
chooses
to
live
at
that
particular
locality
even
though
he
is
paying
taxes
to
the
state
and
is
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
also
subject
to
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
through
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
the
only
issue,
the
only
point
of
distinction
as
i
have
mentioned
before
is
the
point
of
distinction
with
regard
to
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws
and
to
return
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
would
say
that
if
the
state
were
to
provide
that
residents
of
the
enclaves
may
not
vote
for
a
state’s
attorney
montgomery
count,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
a
rational
reason
for
depriving
them
of
that
right
to
vote
because
a
state's
attorney
of
montgomery
county
does
indeed
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
enclave.
but
every
other
officer
of
government
for
whom
these
residents
may
not
vote
under
the
theory
of
the
other
state,
is
a
person
in
whom,
in
whose
services
have
a
vital
interest.
mr.
richard
schifter
no
he
does
not.
mr.
richard
schifter
it
does
but
it
is
enforced
by
the
u.s.
attorney
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
schifter
not
in
assimilative
crimes
act.
this
is
why
he
is
the
only
person
that
has
no
jurisdiction
over
them
at
their
place
of
residence.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
that
this
would
be
done
as
far
as
the
civil
action
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
it
is
a
crime
to
falsify
your
return,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
enforcement
i
would
assume
would
still
be
vested
in
the
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
i
cannot
find
any
way
out
of
that.
the
states
attorney
just
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
u.s.
attorney
would
have
to
proceed
in
terms
of
enforcing
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
it
would
arise
there.
in
the
case
of
military
personnel
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
we
do
not
and
the
point
is
that
in
case
of
military
personnel,
the
issue
arises
much
less
because
they
vote
back
home
in
their
permanent
place
of
residence.
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
group
of
people
who
have
made
their
home
there
for
decades
and
who
plan
to
stay
there
for
good.
mr.
richard
schifter
there
still
would
be
a
tour
of
duty
--
mr.
richard
schifter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
schifter
i
am
not
sure
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suppose
they
do.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
suppose
some
live
there
and
others
may
live
in
homes
on
the
reservation
off
the
enclave.
with
regard
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
absence
of
criminal
jurisdiction
can
deprive
a
voter
or
a
resident
of
a
particular
locality
of
the
right
to
vote
as
to
place
of
residence,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
analogy
in
the
cases
involving
american
indians
who
though
they
live
in
indian
reservations
are
and
are
not
under
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
the
states
in
most
instances,
do
have
the
right
to
vote
under
the
various
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court
since
1948.
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
decisions
both
in
arizona
and
new
mexico
on
this
particular
question.
the
issue
in
that
instance
is
the
same
one
that
arises
here
that
in
the
absence
of
criminal
jurisdiction
of
a
state
over
the
people
living
on
the
reservation,
the
right
to
vote
can
nevertheless
not
be
denied.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
assume
mr.
justice
white,
they
cannot.
they
would
have
to
proceed
through
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
richard
schifter
i
believe
that
this
is
inherent
in
the
right
of
--
in
the
fact
that
the
united
states
has
--
starts
out
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
schifter
civil
proceedings
i
would
assume
could
be
initiated
in
a
certain
court
of
montgomery
country,
maryland
against
the
violators
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
they
can.
since
the
very
beginning
of
the
experience
under
the
forts
and
dock-yard
clause,
an
exemption
has
always
been
written
into--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes,
both
civil
and
criminal.
this
goes
back
--
mr.
richard
schifter
yes.
all
that
can
be
done
and
has
been
--
that
was
something
that
started
way
back
early
19th
century.
mr.
richard
schifter
no.
mr.
richard
schifter
this
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
douglas
is
a
circular
argument
--
mr.
richard
schifter
may
i
just
explain.
the
new
state
law
provides
that
jurors
shall
be
drawn
from
listed
registered
voters.
mr.
richard
schifter
and
if
they
aren't
on
the
list
then
they
will
be
--
can't
be
jurors.

i
suppose
that
we
are
dealing
in
that
particular
situation
with
a
no
man's
land,
will
be
very
well
be
true.
some
of
--
we
have
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
real
factors
involving
people's
lives,
on
a
day
to
day
basis,
we're
dealing
here
fundamentally
with
the
point
that
the
residents
of
enclaves
pay
the
taxes
that
all
other
residents
of
maryland
similarly
situated
pay
and
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
that
other
residents
of
the
state
of
maryland
are
in
terms
of
again,
the
daily
life
that
the
average
resident
of
any
part
of
the
united
states
participates
in.
the
only
opportunity
that
these
people
have
to
vote
is
to
vote
as
residents
of
the
enclave.
if
they
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
voting
on
the
enclave,
they
are
totally
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
voting
anywhere.
