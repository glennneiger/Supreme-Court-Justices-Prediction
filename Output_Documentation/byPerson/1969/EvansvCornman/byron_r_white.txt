so
there's
a
lawyer,
are
there
any
lawyers
on
the
enclave
that
is
practicing
law,
just
taking
drop-in
clients
from
the
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
all
employees
of
the
government
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
were
a
crime
to
practice
law
without
a
license
in
maryland
and
someone
on
the
federal
enclave
was
permitted
by
the
federal
government
to
open
a
law
office
there
and
just
engage
in
practice,
would
you
say
that
maryland
couldn’t
stop
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
are
a
lot
of
legislative
acts
of
the
legislature
of
maryland
that
have
to
be
obeyed
on
the
enclave?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
you
do
have
some
legislative
authority
over
the
residents
of
the
enclave?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
quite
a
few
enclaves,
as
a
matter
of
facts,
have
quite
a
few
powers
over
the
residents
so
as
a
pure
thought
that
you
say
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
even
though
they’ve
ceded
a
good
deal
of
it
back
to
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
because
you
think
the
federal
government
could
take
it
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
they
could
take
it
back,
nevertheless
at
the
present
time
that
federal
government
is
not
exercising
exclusive
legislative
authority
over
the
enclave.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
it
be
exclusive
if
several,
if
substantial
blocks
of
the
maryland
laws
apply
to
enclave
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you,
now,
one
passes
or
amends
its
murder
statutes
or
its
burglary
statute
or
something
else,
that
applies
to
enclave
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whenever
you
raise
your
sales
tax,
enclave
residents
pay
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
mr.
sweeney,
is
the
buck
act
something
that
makes
this
maryland
sales
tax
like
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
is
it
--
i'm
familiar
with
the
idea
that
it
may
have
a
federal
law
but
what
it
is,
is
borrowed
a
state
law.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
are
you
arguing
that
all
of
these
maryland
laws
that
apply
in
the
enclave
are
really
borrowed
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you
ought
to
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
federal
government
said
to
you,
you
may
collect
all
--
you
may
apply
all
of
your
laws
on
this
enclave
and
you
may
collect
property
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
not?
it
would
still
be
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
any,
there
probably
is
not
privately
owned
real
property
in
it
anyway,
so
having
the
right
to
collect
property
taxes
wouldn’t
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
representatives?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
any
case,
you
don't
think
congress
could
--
franchise
the
residents
to
vote
in
state
elections?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
want
them
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wanted
the
military
installation
but
they
didn't
want
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
someone
opens
up
a
liquor
store
on
the
enclave
without
complying
with
maryland's
laws
for
running
retail
liquor
stores.
can
those
who
enforce
those
laws
come
and
seize
the
liquor,
perhaps
the
state's
attorney
couldn't
prosecute
you
say
but
could
they
come
on
and
close
up
the
store?
padlock
it
and
seize
the
liquor?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
civilly
too
then
that
the
enforcement
proceedings
of
any
kind
of
maryland's
laws,
civil
or
criminal
are
in
the
hands
of
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
they
come
and
serve
warrants?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
subpoenas
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
serving
summons?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
probably
take
somebody's
car
away
because
it
hadn't
been
inspected
or
didn't
have
a
license
on
it,
maryland
couldn’t
do
