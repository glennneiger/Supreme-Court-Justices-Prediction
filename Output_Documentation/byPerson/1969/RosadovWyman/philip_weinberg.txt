mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
not
only
is
this
case
plainly
unripe
for
determination
by
the
judiciary
at
this
stage,
because
we're
still
awaiting
the
views
of
hew,
which
the
agency
which
if
it
doesn't
have
primary
jurisdiction
here
certainly
is
the
one
with
the
expertise
and
the
experience
which
should
passed
upon
it.
but
it's
an
extraordinarily
ironic
case
in
any
event
because
in
a
fact
the
petitioners
are
asking
courts
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
adequacy
of
the
welfare
allowances
in
the
various
states
where
congress
has
so
conspicuously
fail
to
act.
and
they
rely
not
on
the
constitution
but
on
a
very
narrow
subsection
test
by
the
1967
congress
which
was
simply
never
built
to
support
the
weight
of
the
construction
that
this
petitioners
seek
to
place
upon
it,
which
is
in
affect
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
aside
from
ruling
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
and
over
and
above
that,
that
the
case
was
clearly
unripe
for
the
termination
because
hew
hasn't
given
us
its
views
yet.
and
i'd
like
to
advert
to
that
briefly
and
first
if
i
may.
this
is
a
very
different
situation
from
the
king
against
smith
where
the
alabama
substitute
for
the
regulation
was
set
aside
and
there
was
a
long
history
of
acquiescence
by
hew
in
the
regulations
of
that
type
which
the
various
states
had.
on
the
contrary,
here
new
york
only
passed
the
statute
in
its
1969
legislative
session.
it
only
went
into
effect
on
july
1st.
hew's
only
had
it
before
them
for
a
couple
of
months
and
as
my
colleague
has
said
it
hasn't
yet
commented
on
whether
or
not
that
these
statute
complies
or
doesn't
comply
with
602
(a)
(23)
which
is
what
the
case
is
all
about.
and
consequently,
there's
nothing
in
king
against
smith
or
any
other
case
that
the
petitioners
cite
here
which
would
provide
the
slightest
foothold
for
jurisdiction
here
prior
to
a
decision
on
this
thing
by
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
but
there
was
a
long
history
of
acquiescence
which
this
court
said
was
tantamount
a
decision
and
that
it
got
hew
out
of
the
way
in
effect.
in
other
words,
if
alabama
had
that
substitute
for
the
rule
for
20
years
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right
justice
white
but
by
letting
it
sit
on
the
desk
so
to
speak
for
20
years
and
many
other
states
might
just
alabama
had
that
provision,
i
believe
more
than
half
of
the
states
had
it.
the
court
felt
that
enough
time
had
passed
certainly
so
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
hew
to
suddenly
wake
up
and
do
something
about
the
alleged
conflict
which
this
court
held
existed
between
the
statute
and
the
alabama
regulation.
of
course
here,
you've
got
an
entirely
different
situation
where
new
york
situation
appears
to
be
unique
and
in
addition
to
that
hew
simply
hasn't
passed
and
its
not
matter
of
the
decades
as
it
was
in
the
alabama
situation
but
just
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
months.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
it's
been
correspondence
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well.
i
think
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
--
i'm
sure
they
would
because
they've
already
questioned
other
aspect
which
are
unrelated
to
this
case
of
the
new
york
statutes
and
in
the
past
they've
given
specific
approval
to
the
actions
of
new
york
and
i
have
to
assume
the
other
states
as
well
so
that
i'm
confident
if
they
no
objections
at
131
(a),
the
new
york
statute,
they
would
say
so.
on
the
other
hand,
should
they
not
say
so
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
we'd
have
a
situation
analogous
to
the
one
which
existed
in
king
against
smith,
but
we
don't
have
either
of
those
situations
now,
what
we
have
is
that
we
know
hew
has
the
question
before
it
and
they
haven't
yet
spoken.
so,
we
certainly
have
to,
it
appears
to
me
give
them
a
chance
to
either
say
yes,
say
no
or
not
act
after
a
reasonable
period
within
which
i
supposed
the
case
would
then
be
right,
aside
from
the
other
jurisdictional
defects
which
we
did
cite.
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh
--
oh,
the
letter
justice
white?
definitely
the
correspondence
has
been
linked.
the
sum
of
it
is
in
the
appendix,
the
november
10th
letter
which
was
too
late
for
also
our
adversaries
to
put
in
the
appendix
is
nevertheless
the
next
i
believed
to
the
hew
brief,
the
amicus
brief
which
hew
supplied
here,
so
that's
before
the
court
and
i'm
sure
that
it
won't
be
just
to
simple
yes.
it
will
be
a
"yes"
because
and
they'll
go
into
reasons
because
they
have
the
expertise
to
do
that
and
then
that's
what
they've
done
in
every
aspect
of
the
new
york
legislation
through
the
years.
now,
below
a
great
deal
of
reliance
is
placed
on
king
against
smith
not
only
on
the
question
of
the
unrightness
of
this
case,
but
in
general
not
withstanding
the
superficial
similarity
and
subject
matter.
this
is
a
very,
very
different
case
from
king
against
smith.
the
complete
absence
of
the
justifiable
constitutional
claim
such
as
existed
in
king
against
smith
not
only
under
the
cuts
the
courts
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
but
it
also
demonstrates
the
petition
--
on
the
merits
the
petitioners
claim
is
simply
untenable.
moreover,
king
against
smith
and
thompson
against
shapiro
as
well
not
only
involve
constitutional
issues
but
also
involve
the
eligibility
of
persons
for
welfare
and
this
claim
here
is
merely
a
claim
regarding
the
amount
which
its
old
position
is
a
very,
very
substantial
difference.
furthermore,
in
king
against
smith
and
in
the
thompson
against
shapiro,
the
residency
case,
there
was
no
requirement
that
if
the
court
were
to
overrule
new
york
statute
would
automatically
in
effect
appropriate
money
from
the
legislature.
those
issues
didn't
exist
in
king
against
smith
or
in
thompson
against
shapiro
and
consequently
if
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
act
as
a
bar
to
such
a
situation
which
we
submitted
thus
and
which
the
three-judge
court
in
williams
against
dandridge,
which
is
on
appeal
to
this
court
held
that
the
federal
court
had
to
stop
short
of
simply
categorically
ordering
a
state
legislature
to
appropriate
money
for
welfare,
that's
what's
clearly
involved
in
the
relief
that
these
petitioners
seek,
which
as
i've
said
is
entirely
different
from
the
two
cases
they
rely
on
the
most
heavily.
now,
let's
examine
the
statute
on
which
the
petitioners
solely
relied
and
what
it
says
is
that
state
shall
adjust
the
amounts
that
are
used
to
determine
the
needs
of
individuals
or
in
the
opulence
of
the
welfare
official
standard
of
need
and
any
maximum
imposed
on
the
aid
of
the
aid
paid
to
families
which
my
colleague
concede
new
york
doesn't
have.
a
maximum
is
at
flat
dollar
amount
such
as
$200.00
per
family
in
which
you
just
don't
have
anymore
no
matter
how
large
the
family
is
which
the
court
in
williams
against
dandridge
and
in
the
main
case
westbury
against
fisher,
the
three-judge
court
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
that's
definitely
not
involved
in
this
case
new
york
never
had
a
maximum
of
that
sort
and
doesn't
now.
in
any
events,
602
(a)
(23)
says
that
the
standard
of
need
and
any
maximums
which
new
york
doesn't
have,
has
to
be
adjusted
to
reflect
increases
in
the
cost
of
living
and
new
york
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
fully
complied
with
the
mandates
of
that
statute.
the
level
of
actual
allowances
to
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
state
is
highest
in
the
country
as
appears
from
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it's
the
highest
of
the
50
states
and
new
york
has
always
out
phased
whatever
federal
requirements
existed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
there's
no
family
maximum,
there's
no
percentage
of
payment
that
needs
such
as
many
states
have.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
131
(a)
your
honor?
no,
it
wasn't
a
change
in
the
standard
of
need.
no,
it
was
--
i'll
get
to
that
in
the
moment
if
i
may
that
it
was
a
streamlining
of
the
standard
of
need
and
the
elimination
of
certain
things
such
as
special
grants
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
but
it
was
definitely
not
a
reduction
in
the
standard
of
need
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
new
york
pays
100%
of
the
standard
of
need.
it
always
has
in
contrast
to
many
states
which
don't
and
shockingly
i
think
some
states
have
a
higher
standard
of
need
that
new
york.
for
example,
although
new
york
pays
an
average
of
$278.00
per
month
to
a
family
of
four
on
welfare
and
we
pay
the
same
whether
it's
afdc
or
aid
to
the
aged
or
blind
or
disabled
or
whatever.
in
missouri,
the
standard
of
need
is
set
to
be
a
substantially
higher
figure
305
but
the
actual
amount
paid
is
only
124.
now,
new
york
simply
doesn't
do
that,
we've
never
indulged
in
that
we
pay
100%
of
the
standard
of
need.
indeed
section
131
of
our
social
services
law
which
is
the
statute
which
dated
131
(a),
the
one
this
case
deals
with
and
which
is
still
on
the
books
says,
“in
so
far
as
funds
are
available
for
that
purpose,
new
york
is
to
provide
adequately
for
those
unable
to
maintain
themselves.”
and
that's
precisely
what
new
york
has
always
lived
up
to.
we've
reprised
every
year.
that
the
social
service
is
proponent,
the
respondents
here
takes
its
own
cost
of
living
surveys
throughout
the
state.
it
also
employs
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
federal
figures
and
it
reprised
in
may
of
1968
and
then
adjusted
the
standard
of
need
and
the
levels
of
payment
because
in
new
york
their
tied
together.
in
august
of
1968,
prior
to
131
(a)
when
the
levels
was
said
administratively
and
that's
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
for
a
family
four
exclusive
of
rent,
because
rent
is
paid
additionally
its
tacked
on
for
the
monthly
allowance
in
new
york.
the
average
went
up
from
173
a
month
to
191
a
month
for
a
family
of
four.
and
thereafter,
131
(a)
was
passed
which
used
as
its
matrix,
the
reprising
which
took
place
in
1968
and
the
way
that
it
worked
was
this.
the
legislature
took
an
average
of
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
in
order
to
eliminate
the
vast
administrative
paperwork
in
the
time
of
social
services
officials
which
went
to
figuring
out
what
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
was
in
any
given
family
when
you're
dealing
with
hundreds
or
thousands
of
families.
the
court
can
appreciate
the
time
consuming
nature
of
that
job
in
addition
to
the
readjustments,
everytime
the
oldest
child
in
the
family
reached
another
year,
that
placed
the
family
in
another
bracket
and
if
the
family
didn't
get
around
to
notifying
the
local
official
or
if
the
officials
were
lax,
then
there
was
a
deferment
to
that
family,
they
didn't
get
the
increase
that
they
were
entitled
to.
so
what
the
legislature
did
was
it
averaged
these
disparities
based
on
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
and
it
took
a
figure
which
was
based
on
that
average
and
now
a
family
of
whatever
size
depending
only
on
whether
it's
adults
or
children
gets
a
certain
specific
amounts.
there
was
no
cutback
into
characterize
it
as
a
cutback
as
the
petitioners
repeatedly
do
simply
sheds
heat
and
not
light.
now,
another
change
which
was
made
with
the
elimination
of
special
grants
and
this
was
done
on
the
basis
of
the
enlightened
judgment
of
everybody
in
the
field,
every
enlightened
commentator
including
hew
itself
which
as
early
as
1964
call
on
the
states
to
eliminate
special
grants.
what
special
grants
mean
as
we
described
them
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this
is
at
the
recipient
of
welfare
has
to
go
half
in
hands
to
the
local
official
asking
for
special
grant
to
cover
a
specific
purpose,
it's
degrading,
it's
time
consuming
and
again
requires
a
great
deal
of
administrative
paperwork.
mr.
philip
weinberg
special
grants
go
through
as
specific
items
such
as
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
moving
expenses
justice
brennan,
a
diet
through
somebody
who's
diabetic
let's
say
or
something
needs
special
diet,
miets
for
infants,
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
were
eliminated
but
they're
still
available
to
the
welfare
recipient
personally
because
the
figure
of
$25.00
per
month
was
tacked
on
to
the
average
in
1969
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
elimination
of
special
grants
and
also
because
many
of
these
items
such
as
moving
in
a
security
deposit
for
an
apartment
rental
and
that's
necessary
are
now
available
through
a
purchase
of
services
which
is
over
and
above
the
allowance.
in
other
words,
where
the
local
or
state
social
services
department
simply
furnishes
the
service
itself
by
purchasing
it
from
a
contractor
or
from
the
landlord
where
that's
applicable,
so
that
while
these
special
grants
were
always
over
and
above
the
standard
of
need
and
their
elimination
even
though
it's
been
compensated
for
anyway
doesn't
in
anyway
detract
or
reduce
the
standard
of
need.
nonetheless,
many
of
these
items
are
still
in
fact
available
to
the
welfare
recipient.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
despite
the
special
grants
in
addition
required
investigation
and
it
requires
the
councilors
to--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
guess
they
haven't
looked
into
the
question
fully
enough
and
exhaustedly
enough
to
make
up
their
minds
yet.
i
presume
that
they're
going
to
do
so
promptly.
mr.
philip
weinberg
pardon
me
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know
how
long
it
takes
but
i
would
say
this,
the
statute
was
only
enacted
in
april,
it
was
then
amended
in
may.
they've
only
had
it
before
them
in
final
for
really
a
couple
of
months
in
effect
that
only
went
into
effect
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
this
is
the
very
note
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
that
particular
letter
doesn't
but
the
very
note
of
the
correspondents
back
and
forth
which
appears
in
the
appendix
is
just
exactly
that
question.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
a
joint
appendix
it's
the
petitioner's
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
it's
a
letter
by
a
mr.
collison
who's
the
regional
director
i
believe,
his
title
as
an
hew,
anyway
he's
the
man
whose
got
jurisdiction
over
this
and
has
been
constant
correspondents
back
and
forth
dealing
with
these
very
questions.
now,
the
payment
says,
“we've
seen
our
exclusive
of
rent
and
also
fuel
for
heating”
which
is
the
small
item
of
course,
but
rents
have
increased
13%
in
the
less
three
years
in
new
york
city
alone
and
it's
the
practice
to
pay
whatever
rent
the
recipient
actually
has
subject
to
maximum
rentals
and
even
they
can
be
waived
in
the
various
counties
when
necessary
so
that
there's
been
a
over
and
above
the
course
of
living
adjust
which
new
york
did
in
1968
and
did
again
in
1969.
now,
withstanding
the
passage
of
131
(a),
there's
been
the
increases
in
rent
which
alone
it
seems
to
me
constitute
compliance
with
the
statute
or
partial
compliance
but
the
main
point
here
is
that
there
was
full
compliance
by
the
may
1968
reprising.
now,
the
131
(a)
specifically
requires
reprising
even
there
weren't
602
(a)
(23),
we'd
be
doing
it
anyway.
and
in
fact
we
have
done
it
and
the
respondents
have
submitted
to
the
legislature
the
results
of
that
reprising,
it's
too
recent
to
be
in
the
appendix
but
they've
ask
the
legislature
to
provide
sizable
increases
for
1970
which
will
increase
the
average
for
a
family
of
four
monthly
payment
not
including
rent
from
the
present
185
to
208
depending
on
the
locality
to
a
state
wide
$225.00
a
month
and
then
as
of
may
1970,
a
state
wide
$230.00
a
month.
so
that
there's
no
question
but
that
new
york
fully
comply
in
full
with
any
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
it
was,
justice
white
it
was
streamlining
in
the
elimination
of
the
average
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
getting
to
that,
it
was
the
basically
two
things.
it
was
the
elimination
of
special
grants
for
the
reasons
i've
said,
the
administrative
simplicity
in
taking
the
burden
off
the
back
of
the
welfare
recipient
to
go
and
apply
for
a
special
grant
which
benefits
the
more
aggressive
recipient
at
the
expense
of
the
meek
and
also
freeze
the
counselors,
who
don't
have
to
fool
around
now
with
the
investigation
that
each
individual
request
for
a
special
grant
and
make
another
vote
that
time
to
counseling
and
finding
jobs
and
everything
else
that
counselors
trained
to
do,
and
the
other
thing
was
the
averaging
which
eliminates
the
paperwork
and
the
delay
and
the
time
consuming
aspects
of
paying
a
different
amount
for
each
child.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
still
determine
individual
needs
but
we
do
it
under
a
formula
which
was
simplified
in
no
way
reduced
but
simplified
so
that
how
much
family
afford
gets
now
doesn't
depend
on
whether
the
oldest
child
in
that
family
is
9
or
11
or
13,
it
now
depends
on
--it
is
now
a
set
amount
for
a
family
of
four
with
a
difference
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
state
which
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
that's
the
proportion
of
this
case
that
mooted
out
and
which
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
yes,
sir.
now,
when
we
look
at
602
(a)
(23)
as
we
have
to
in
order
to
try
to
gleam
what
congress
meant
when
it
passed
it,
we
see
that
first
of
all
it's
a
very
minor
thought
of
section
602
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
supremacy
clause
although
my
colleague
here
adverts
to
it
clearly
isn't
relevant
to
this
case
because
congress
has
simply
never
exercised
any
real
authority
over
the
levels
of
welfare
allowance
is
paid
by
the
states.
indeed,
601
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
the
basic
statute
which
provides
the
federal
grants
and
aid
in
the
field
that
afdc
says
the
states
ought
to
furnish
assistance
as
far
as
practicable
under
the
conditions
in
each
state.
and
what
that
means
in
effect
is
we've
seen
is
that
new
york
pays
$278.00
a
month,
missouri
pays
$124.00,
mississippi
pays
$55.00
a
month
and
even
the
district
of
columbia
where
congress
is
4537
pays
$184.00
a
month
on
the
average
which
is
about
2/3's
of
what
new
york
pays.
now,
while
imposing
various
other
requirements
as
a
condition
of
receiving
federal
grants,
congress
has
deliberately
refrain
from
mandating
levels
and
indeed
it
even
perpetuates
to
some
extent
the
inequity
between
the
states
by
scaling
the
ratio
of
the
federal
contribution
so
as
to
give
more
money
for
the
state's
that
pay
less
paradoxically
enough.
and
indeed
in
king
against
smith
which
was
decided
after
602
(a)
(23)
was
enacted
by
the
67th
congress,
this
court
said
“each
state
is
free
to
determine
the
level
of
benefits
by
the
amount
of
funds
that
devotes
for
the
program.”
the
statute
requires
an
increase
in
the
standard
of
need,
there's
no
question
about
that
and
new
york
complied
with
that
by
its
reprising
in
1968
and
it's
again
reprised
in
1969.
the
bill
when
it
was
originally
introduced
by
the
administration
made
significant
changes
which
never
took
effect
because
congress
didn't
see
it
the
way
hew
saw
it.
the
bill
has
introduced
required
each
state
to
pay
the
full
standard
of
need
which
as
we've
seen
would
be
a
gigantic
step
forward
in
the
whole
administration
of
welfare
and
many
states,
26
according
the
count
we
took,
don't
even
pay
their
own
acknowledged
standard
of
need.
in
effect
they
say
to
a
family,
“we
know
you
need
$300.00
a
month
or
whatever
it
is
but
we're
not
going
to
give
you
$300.00
a
month.”
the
bill
also
required
an
annual
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
and
since
it
required
each
state
to
pay
the
standard
of
need,
it
required
an
annual
adjustment
of
the
amount
actually
paid
to
every
afdc
recipient.
this
would've
been
a
bill
of
enormous
impact
but
the
house
turned
it
down
and
the
senate,
while
passing
a
portion
of
it
only
passed
the
annual
updating
part
so
where
in
effect
when
it
finally
got
through,
it
was
emasculated
and
then
the
house-senate
conference
committee
further
emasculated
it
by
eliminating
the
annual
updating
and
leaving
it
as
it
is
with
a
simple
one-shot
updating
of
the
standard
of
need
requirement
and
no
requirements
at
all
that
a
state
increased
the
amount
actually
paid.
mr.
philip
weinberg
presumably
they
would,
but
whatever
they
might
be
planning
to
do
in
the
future
and
of
course
since
then
as
the
court
knows,
there's
been
many
proposals
which
will
change
the
whole
field
of
welfare
around.
whatever
congress
might
have
been
thinking
about
doing
in
the
future,
they
didn't
do
very
much
in
1967.
it's
significant
that
in
the
field
of
old
ages
systems
not
involved
in
this
case.
they
raised
the
actual
amounts
paid
$4.00
a
month.
they
appropriated
money
specifically
for
that
purpose,
they
eluded
to
it
in
their
committee
reports
and
so
on
and
the
fact
that
that
is
no
reference
in
the
committee
reports
to
any
similar
provision
here
and
no
propose
appropriation
made
it
all.
it's
evident
that
they
had
no
such
intent
in
passing
602
(a)
(23)
to
do
anything
analogous
to
that
in
the
field
of
afdc.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
we
did
it.
we
did
it
in
1968.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
would
have
done
it
anyway
because
all
statute
requires
that
in
any
of
that
we
certainly
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
although,
unquestionably
it
did
comply
with
what
congress
said.
and
as
we've
seen
the
conference
committee
then
eliminated
annual
updating
and
the
language
of
their
report
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
significant.
it
said
it
requires
one
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
before
july
1,
1969
and
the
hew
in
characterizing
this
provision
in
the
amicus
brief
they
put
it
in
lampton
against
bonin
that
louisiana
case,
which
is
referred
to
continuously
through
this
whole
case,
used
the
phrase
that
congress
could've
hardly
paid
less
attention
to
it
when
they
passed
602
(a)
(23).
and
yet
the
petitioners
would
have
us
believed
that
this
bill
was
some
sort
of
a
trojan
horse
ironically
brought
in
by
the
opponents
of
welfare
reform
as
it
reflected
by
the
way
the
senate
vote
worked
out,
and
opposed
by
the
people
who
seek
higher
levels
of
welfare.
it's
--
it's
evidence
from
the
legislative
history
here
aside
from
the
plain
meaning
of
this
little
statute
that
congress
rejected
a
provision
for
actually
requiring
every
state
to
meet
its
standard
of
need
and
it
simply
require
that
the
standard
be
updated
which
as
we've
seen
and
new
york
would've
done
anyway.
in
the
recent
proposals
of
the
president
in
the
field
of
welfare,
is
significant
that
the
president
remarked
it
for
the
first
time
under
the
proposals
now
being
annunciated.
all
dependent
families
with
children
would
be
assured
of
minimum
standard
payments.
now,
we've
seen
that
new
york
has
no
maximums
such
as
it
was
involved
in
williams
against
dandridge.
that's
conceded
and
so
i
don't
think
it
merits
any
further
discussion.
now,
this
brings
us
to
a
further
and
extremely
difficult
point.
the
fact
is
that
this
statute
requires
no
more
than
a
one-shot
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
and
that
inescapably
raises
a
question
of
fundamental
jurisdiction
over
and
above
the
question
of
ripeness.
supposed
the
petitioners
construction
of
the
statute
were
correct,
then
it
would
place
the
judiciary
in
a
position
of
having
to
categorically
order
the
new
york
legislature,
assuming
that
this
court
found
we
didn't
comply,
to
disperse
money
from
each
treasury
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
any
constitutional
infirmity
such
as
it
was
involved
in
king
against
smith.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
forbids
such
an
interpretation
and
in
williams
against
dandridge,
the
three-judge
of
court
reach
the
same
conclusion.
what
this
is,
is
in
reality
a
thinly
veiled
suit
to
compel
the
new
york
legislature
to
appropriate
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
all
--
they
asked
me
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
sir
the
petitioner
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
a
great
deal
more
than
they're
asking
for
injunction.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don't
believe
it
does.
i
think
the
injunction
which
is
what
this
court
of
appeals
said
would
be
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
declaratory
judgement
would
still
be
in
effect
in
order
or
it
wouldn't
be
an
injunction
but
it
would
be
virtually
in
order
compelling
the
state
legislature
appropriate
for
money.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
what
we've
been
insisted
throughout
the
whole
litigation,
no
question
about
it.
it
would
--
there's
just
no
way
to
avoid
that
problem.
assuming
the
state
were
ineligible
--
were
violated
of
602
(a)
(23)
at
the
most
that
would
mean
that
we
were
ineligible
to
receive
federal
funds.
mr.
philip
weinberg
then
that
would
eliminate
the
unripeness
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
still
be
the
basic
question
that
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
which
i'd
like
to
get
to
admit
it.
mr.
philip
weinberg
assumed
--
not
just
on
the
unripeness,
justice
white,
but
also
on
other
questions.
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
assuming
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
assuming
it
were
right
by
hew
passing
on
it,
that
would
bring
and
assuming
that
you
would
prepare
to
rule
that
new
york
didn't
comply,
that
would
bring
us
up
to
the
question,
i
was
just
starting
to
address
myself
to,
could
the
court
order
in
effect
whether
by
declaratory
judgement
or
injunction,
could
the
court
order
the
new
york
legislature
disperse
additional
money
for
welfare
without
violating
the
eleventh
amendment
and
a
whole
volume
of
case
law
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
this
wasn't
involved
in
king
against
smith.
because
in
king
against
smith
and
then
the
residency
cases
as
well,
there
was
a
way
for
the
state
to
comply
by
simply
shuffling
amounts
--
shuffling
around
the
amount
of
money
that
it
was
going
to
spend
for
welfare.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
i'll
be
finishing
up
in
a
moment.
when
we
turn
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
here
is
that
once
the
equal
protection
claim
of
the
geographical
differential
between
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
state
was
mooted
as
it
was,
there
remained
only
the
statutory
claim.
and
there
was
simply
no
authority
for
the
judiciary
entertaining
that
claim.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
avoid
that
problem
by
saying
that
dependent
jurisdiction
doctrine
gets
them
over
that
hurdle,
but
it
simple
doesn't
because
this
court
held
in
united
mine
workers
against
gibbs
and
as
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
on
many
occasions
when
the
only
constitutional
issue
in
the
case,
the
only
issue
where
there's
federal
jurisdiction
is
knocked
out
early
in
the
case
then
for
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
would
amount
to
the
non-justiciable
tail
wagging
the
justiciable
dog,
as
the
court
very
colorfully
put
it
in
one
of
the
cases
and
that
that's
simply
what
we
have
here
so
pending
jurisdictions
have
no
assistance
to
the
petitioners.
they
rely
on
1331
but
it's
clear
that
they
don't
have
$10,000.00
here
to
talk
about
and
as
this
court
held
in
schneider
against
harris
individual
plaintiffs
and
a
class
suit
can't
aggregate
their
claims
in
order
to
try
to
reach
the
$10,000.00
requirement.
they
also
rely
on
1343
and
42
u.s.c.
1983
the
classic
civil
right
statutes,
but
the
fallacy
there,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
was
that
402
(a)
(23)
simply
can't
be
construed
as
a
statute
designed
to
bring
about
civil
rights.
what
it
does,
is
a
statute
which
really
perpetuates
in
inequity
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
effect
at
all.
it
--
it
locks
the
states
into
the
extraordinarily
inequitable
amounts
of
welfare
assistance
that
they
pay.
this
statute
as
enacted
requires
the
states
to
adjust
their
standard
of
need
and
new
york
did
so.
it's
a
narrow
statute
and
this
is
a
narrow
case.
there
are
many
defects
in
the
welfare
system
as
we
look
at
it
throughout
the
whole
country
and
there've
been
many
proposals
for
solution
but
the
congress
has
itself
maintained
as
we've
seen
vast
and
equalities
by
its
refusal
to
act
and
equalize
the
payments
in
the
various
states.
to
adopt
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
would
not
end
these
severe
inequities.
and
to
argue
that
new
york
contravened
it,
when
it
so
plainly
didn't
and
that
any
non-conformity
between
this
new
york
state
statute
and
602
(a)
(23)
would
void
the
entire
state
program
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
unconstitutionality
or
discrimination.
it's
simply
at
odds
with
the
plain
meaning
of
their
statute
and
its
an
invitation
to
just
that
sort
of
judicial
consideration
of
questions
of
legislative
policy
of
the
states,
which
this
court
since
the
cases
in
the
1930's
has
correctly
resisted.
the
order
of
appeal
from
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
not
only
is
this
case
plainly
unripe
for
determination
by
the
judiciary
at
this
stage,
because
we're
still
awaiting
the
views
of
hew,
which
the
agency
which
if
it
doesn't
have
primary
jurisdiction
here
certainly
is
the
one
with
the
expertise
and
the
experience
which
should
passed
upon
it.
but
it's
an
extraordinarily
ironic
case
in
any
event
because
in
a
fact
the
petitioners
are
asking
courts
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
adequacy
of
the
welfare
allowances
in
the
various
states
where
congress
has
so
conspicuously
fail
to
act.
and
they
rely
not
on
the
constitution
but
on
a
very
narrow
subsection
test
by
the
1967
congress
which
was
simply
never
built
to
support
the
weight
of
the
construction
that
this
petitioners
seek
to
place
upon
it,
which
is
in
affect
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
aside
from
ruling
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
and
over
and
above
that,
that
the
case
was
clearly
unripe
for
the
termination
because
hew
hasn't
given
us
its
views
yet.
and
i'd
like
to
advert
to
that
briefly
and
first
if
i
may.
this
is
a
very
different
situation
from
the
king
against
smith
where
the
alabama
substitute
for
the
regulation
was
set
aside
and
there
was
a
long
history
of
acquiescence
by
hew
in
the
regulations
of
that
type
which
the
various
states
had.
on
the
contrary,
here
new
york
only
passed
the
statute
in
its
1969
legislative
session.
it
only
went
into
effect
on
july
1st.
hew's
only
had
it
before
them
for
a
couple
of
months
and
as
my
colleague
has
said
it
hasn't
yet
commented
on
whether
or
not
that
these
statute
complies
or
doesn't
comply
with
602
(a)
(23)
which
is
what
the
case
is
all
about.
and
consequently,
there's
nothing
in
king
against
smith
or
any
other
case
that
the
petitioners
cite
here
which
would
provide
the
slightest
foothold
for
jurisdiction
here
prior
to
a
decision
on
this
thing
by
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
but
there
was
a
long
history
of
acquiescence
which
this
court
said
was
tantamount
a
decision
and
that
it
got
hew
out
of
the
way
in
effect.
in
other
words,
if
alabama
had
that
substitute
for
the
rule
for
20
years
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right
justice
white
but
by
letting
it
sit
on
the
desk
so
to
speak
for
20
years
and
many
other
states
might
just
alabama
had
that
provision,
i
believe
more
than
half
of
the
states
had
it.
the
court
felt
that
enough
time
had
passed
certainly
so
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
hew
to
suddenly
wake
up
and
do
something
about
the
alleged
conflict
which
this
court
held
existed
between
the
statute
and
the
alabama
regulation.
of
course
here,
you've
got
an
entirely
different
situation
where
new
york
situation
appears
to
be
unique
and
in
addition
to
that
hew
simply
hasn't
passed
and
its
not
matter
of
the
decades
as
it
was
in
the
alabama
situation
but
just
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
months.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
it's
been
correspondence
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well.
i
think
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
--
i'm
sure
they
would
because
they've
already
questioned
other
aspect
which
are
unrelated
to
this
case
of
the
new
york
statutes
and
in
the
past
they've
given
specific
approval
to
the
actions
of
new
york
and
i
have
to
assume
the
other
states
as
well
so
that
i'm
confident
if
they
no
objections
at
131
(a),
the
new
york
statute,
they
would
say
so.
on
the
other
hand,
should
they
not
say
so
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
we'd
have
a
situation
analogous
to
the
one
which
existed
in
king
against
smith,
but
we
don't
have
either
of
those
situations
now,
what
we
have
is
that
we
know
hew
has
the
question
before
it
and
they
haven't
yet
spoken.
so,
we
certainly
have
to,
it
appears
to
me
give
them
a
chance
to
either
say
yes,
say
no
or
not
act
after
a
reasonable
period
within
which
i
supposed
the
case
would
then
be
right,
aside
from
the
other
jurisdictional
defects
which
we
did
cite.
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh
--
oh,
the
letter
justice
white?
definitely
the
correspondence
has
been
linked.
the
sum
of
it
is
in
the
appendix,
the
november
10th
letter
which
was
too
late
for
also
our
adversaries
to
put
in
the
appendix
is
nevertheless
the
next
i
believed
to
the
hew
brief,
the
amicus
brief
which
hew
supplied
here,
so
that's
before
the
court
and
i'm
sure
that
it
won't
be
just
to
simple
yes.
it
will
be
a
"yes"
because
and
they'll
go
into
reasons
because
they
have
the
expertise
to
do
that
and
then
that's
what
they've
done
in
every
aspect
of
the
new
york
legislation
through
the
years.
now,
below
a
great
deal
of
reliance
is
placed
on
king
against
smith
not
only
on
the
question
of
the
unrightness
of
this
case,
but
in
general
not
withstanding
the
superficial
similarity
and
subject
matter.
this
is
a
very,
very
different
case
from
king
against
smith.
the
complete
absence
of
the
justifiable
constitutional
claim
such
as
existed
in
king
against
smith
not
only
under
the
cuts
the
courts
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
but
it
also
demonstrates
the
petition
--
on
the
merits
the
petitioners
claim
is
simply
untenable.
moreover,
king
against
smith
and
thompson
against
shapiro
as
well
not
only
involve
constitutional
issues
but
also
involve
the
eligibility
of
persons
for
welfare
and
this
claim
here
is
merely
a
claim
regarding
the
amount
which
its
old
position
is
a
very,
very
substantial
difference.
furthermore,
in
king
against
smith
and
in
the
thompson
against
shapiro,
the
residency
case,
there
was
no
requirement
that
if
the
court
were
to
overrule
new
york
statute
would
automatically
in
effect
appropriate
money
from
the
legislature.
those
issues
didn't
exist
in
king
against
smith
or
in
thompson
against
shapiro
and
consequently
if
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
act
as
a
bar
to
such
a
situation
which
we
submitted
thus
and
which
the
three-judge
court
in
williams
against
dandridge,
which
is
on
appeal
to
this
court
held
that
the
federal
court
had
to
stop
short
of
simply
categorically
ordering
a
state
legislature
to
appropriate
money
for
welfare,
that's
what's
clearly
involved
in
the
relief
that
these
petitioners
seek,
which
as
i've
said
is
entirely
different
from
the
two
cases
they
rely
on
the
most
heavily.
now,
let's
examine
the
statute
on
which
the
petitioners
solely
relied
and
what
it
says
is
that
state
shall
adjust
the
amounts
that
are
used
to
determine
the
needs
of
individuals
or
in
the
opulence
of
the
welfare
official
standard
of
need
and
any
maximum
imposed
on
the
aid
of
the
aid
paid
to
families
which
my
colleague
concede
new
york
doesn't
have.
a
maximum
is
at
flat
dollar
amount
such
as
$200.00
per
family
in
which
you
just
don't
have
anymore
no
matter
how
large
the
family
is
which
the
court
in
williams
against
dandridge
and
in
the
main
case
westbury
against
fisher,
the
three-judge
court
declared
to
be
unconstitutional.
that's
definitely
not
involved
in
this
case
new
york
never
had
a
maximum
of
that
sort
and
doesn't
now.
in
any
events,
602
(a)
(23)
says
that
the
standard
of
need
and
any
maximums
which
new
york
doesn't
have,
has
to
be
adjusted
to
reflect
increases
in
the
cost
of
living
and
new
york
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
fully
complied
with
the
mandates
of
that
statute.
the
level
of
actual
allowances
to
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
state
is
highest
in
the
country
as
appears
from
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it's
the
highest
of
the
50
states
and
new
york
has
always
out
phased
whatever
federal
requirements
existed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
there's
no
family
maximum,
there's
no
percentage
of
payment
that
needs
such
as
many
states
have.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
131
(a)
your
honor?
no,
it
wasn't
a
change
in
the
standard
of
need.
no,
it
was
--
i'll
get
to
that
in
the
moment
if
i
may
that
it
was
a
streamlining
of
the
standard
of
need
and
the
elimination
of
certain
things
such
as
special
grants
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
but
it
was
definitely
not
a
reduction
in
the
standard
of
need
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
new
york
pays
100%
of
the
standard
of
need.
it
always
has
in
contrast
to
many
states
which
don't
and
shockingly
i
think
some
states
have
a
higher
standard
of
need
that
new
york.
for
example,
although
new
york
pays
an
average
of
$278.00
per
month
to
a
family
of
four
on
welfare
and
we
pay
the
same
whether
it's
afdc
or
aid
to
the
aged
or
blind
or
disabled
or
whatever.
in
missouri,
the
standard
of
need
is
set
to
be
a
substantially
higher
figure
305
but
the
actual
amount
paid
is
only
124.
now,
new
york
simply
doesn't
do
that,
we've
never
indulged
in
that
we
pay
100%
of
the
standard
of
need.
indeed
section
131
of
our
social
services
law
which
is
the
statute
which
dated
131
(a),
the
one
this
case
deals
with
and
which
is
still
on
the
books
says,
“in
so
far
as
funds
are
available
for
that
purpose,
new
york
is
to
provide
adequately
for
those
unable
to
maintain
themselves.”
and
that's
precisely
what
new
york
has
always
lived
up
to.
we've
reprised
every
year.
that
the
social
service
is
proponent,
the
respondents
here
takes
its
own
cost
of
living
surveys
throughout
the
state.
it
also
employs
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
federal
figures
and
it
reprised
in
may
of
1968
and
then
adjusted
the
standard
of
need
and
the
levels
of
payment
because
in
new
york
their
tied
together.
in
august
of
1968,
prior
to
131
(a)
when
the
levels
was
said
administratively
and
that's
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
for
a
family
four
exclusive
of
rent,
because
rent
is
paid
additionally
its
tacked
on
for
the
monthly
allowance
in
new
york.
the
average
went
up
from
173
a
month
to
191
a
month
for
a
family
of
four.
and
thereafter,
131
(a)
was
passed
which
used
as
its
matrix,
the
reprising
which
took
place
in
1968
and
the
way
that
it
worked
was
this.
the
legislature
took
an
average
of
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
in
order
to
eliminate
the
vast
administrative
paperwork
in
the
time
of
social
services
officials
which
went
to
figuring
out
what
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
was
in
any
given
family
when
you're
dealing
with
hundreds
or
thousands
of
families.
the
court
can
appreciate
the
time
consuming
nature
of
that
job
in
addition
to
the
readjustments,
everytime
the
oldest
child
in
the
family
reached
another
year,
that
placed
the
family
in
another
bracket
and
if
the
family
didn't
get
around
to
notifying
the
local
official
or
if
the
officials
were
lax,
then
there
was
a
deferment
to
that
family,
they
didn't
get
the
increase
that
they
were
entitled
to.
so
what
the
legislature
did
was
it
averaged
these
disparities
based
on
the
age
of
the
oldest
child
and
it
took
a
figure
which
was
based
on
that
average
and
now
a
family
of
whatever
size
depending
only
on
whether
it's
adults
or
children
gets
a
certain
specific
amounts.
there
was
no
cutback
into
characterize
it
as
a
cutback
as
the
petitioners
repeatedly
do
simply
sheds
heat
and
not
light.
now,
another
change
which
was
made
with
the
elimination
of
special
grants
and
this
was
done
on
the
basis
of
the
enlightened
judgment
of
everybody
in
the
field,
every
enlightened
commentator
including
hew
itself
which
as
early
as
1964
call
on
the
states
to
eliminate
special
grants.
what
special
grants
mean
as
we
described
them
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this
is
at
the
recipient
of
welfare
has
to
go
half
in
hands
to
the
local
official
asking
for
special
grant
to
cover
a
specific
purpose,
it's
degrading,
it's
time
consuming
and
again
requires
a
great
deal
of
administrative
paperwork.
mr.
philip
weinberg
special
grants
go
through
as
specific
items
such
as
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
moving
expenses
justice
brennan,
a
diet
through
somebody
who's
diabetic
let's
say
or
something
needs
special
diet,
miets
for
infants,
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
were
eliminated
but
they're
still
available
to
the
welfare
recipient
personally
because
the
figure
of
$25.00
per
month
was
tacked
on
to
the
average
in
1969
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
elimination
of
special
grants
and
also
because
many
of
these
items
such
as
moving
in
a
security
deposit
for
an
apartment
rental
and
that's
necessary
are
now
available
through
a
purchase
of
services
which
is
over
and
above
the
allowance.
in
other
words,
where
the
local
or
state
social
services
department
simply
furnishes
the
service
itself
by
purchasing
it
from
a
contractor
or
from
the
landlord
where
that's
applicable,
so
that
while
these
special
grants
were
always
over
and
above
the
standard
of
need
and
their
elimination
even
though
it's
been
compensated
for
anyway
doesn't
in
anyway
detract
or
reduce
the
standard
of
need.
nonetheless,
many
of
these
items
are
still
in
fact
available
to
the
welfare
recipient.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
despite
the
special
grants
in
addition
required
investigation
and
it
requires
the
councilors
to--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
guess
they
haven't
looked
into
the
question
fully
enough
and
exhaustedly
enough
to
make
up
their
minds
yet.
i
presume
that
they're
going
to
do
so
promptly.
mr.
philip
weinberg
pardon
me
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know
how
long
it
takes
but
i
would
say
this,
the
statute
was
only
enacted
in
april,
it
was
then
amended
in
may.
they've
only
had
it
before
them
in
final
for
really
a
couple
of
months
in
effect
that
only
went
into
effect
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
this
is
the
very
note
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
that
particular
letter
doesn't
but
the
very
note
of
the
correspondents
back
and
forth
which
appears
in
the
appendix
is
just
exactly
that
question.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
a
joint
appendix
it's
the
petitioner's
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
it's
a
letter
by
a
mr.
collison
who's
the
regional
director
i
believe,
his
title
as
an
hew,
anyway
he's
the
man
whose
got
jurisdiction
over
this
and
has
been
constant
correspondents
back
and
forth
dealing
with
these
very
questions.
now,
the
payment
says,
“we've
seen
our
exclusive
of
rent
and
also
fuel
for
heating”
which
is
the
small
item
of
course,
but
rents
have
increased
13%
in
the
less
three
years
in
new
york
city
alone
and
it's
the
practice
to
pay
whatever
rent
the
recipient
actually
has
subject
to
maximum
rentals
and
even
they
can
be
waived
in
the
various
counties
when
necessary
so
that
there's
been
a
over
and
above
the
course
of
living
adjust
which
new
york
did
in
1968
and
did
again
in
1969.
now,
withstanding
the
passage
of
131
(a),
there's
been
the
increases
in
rent
which
alone
it
seems
to
me
constitute
compliance
with
the
statute
or
partial
compliance
but
the
main
point
here
is
that
there
was
full
compliance
by
the
may
1968
reprising.
now,
the
131
(a)
specifically
requires
reprising
even
there
weren't
602
(a)
(23),
we'd
be
doing
it
anyway.
and
in
fact
we
have
done
it
and
the
respondents
have
submitted
to
the
legislature
the
results
of
that
reprising,
it's
too
recent
to
be
in
the
appendix
but
they've
ask
the
legislature
to
provide
sizable
increases
for
1970
which
will
increase
the
average
for
a
family
of
four
monthly
payment
not
including
rent
from
the
present
185
to
208
depending
on
the
locality
to
a
state
wide
$225.00
a
month
and
then
as
of
may
1970,
a
state
wide
$230.00
a
month.
so
that
there's
no
question
but
that
new
york
fully
comply
in
full
with
any
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
it
was,
justice
white
it
was
streamlining
in
the
elimination
of
the
average
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
getting
to
that,
it
was
the
basically
two
things.
it
was
the
elimination
of
special
grants
for
the
reasons
i've
said,
the
administrative
simplicity
in
taking
the
burden
off
the
back
of
the
welfare
recipient
to
go
and
apply
for
a
special
grant
which
benefits
the
more
aggressive
recipient
at
the
expense
of
the
meek
and
also
freeze
the
counselors,
who
don't
have
to
fool
around
now
with
the
investigation
that
each
individual
request
for
a
special
grant
and
make
another
vote
that
time
to
counseling
and
finding
jobs
and
everything
else
that
counselors
trained
to
do,
and
the
other
thing
was
the
averaging
which
eliminates
the
paperwork
and
the
delay
and
the
time
consuming
aspects
of
paying
a
different
amount
for
each
child.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
still
determine
individual
needs
but
we
do
it
under
a
formula
which
was
simplified
in
no
way
reduced
but
simplified
so
that
how
much
family
afford
gets
now
doesn't
depend
on
whether
the
oldest
child
in
that
family
is
9
or
11
or
13,
it
now
depends
on
--it
is
now
a
set
amount
for
a
family
of
four
with
a
difference
between
new
york
city
and
the
rest
of
the
state
which
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
that's
the
proportion
of
this
case
that
mooted
out
and
which
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
yes,
sir.
now,
when
we
look
at
602
(a)
(23)
as
we
have
to
in
order
to
try
to
gleam
what
congress
meant
when
it
passed
it,
we
see
that
first
of
all
it's
a
very
minor
thought
of
section
602
of
the
social
security
act
and
the
supremacy
clause
although
my
colleague
here
adverts
to
it
clearly
isn't
relevant
to
this
case
because
congress
has
simply
never
exercised
any
real
authority
over
the
levels
of
welfare
allowance
is
paid
by
the
states.
indeed,
601
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
the
basic
statute
which
provides
the
federal
grants
and
aid
in
the
field
that
afdc
says
the
states
ought
to
furnish
assistance
as
far
as
practicable
under
the
conditions
in
each
state.
and
what
that
means
in
effect
is
we've
seen
is
that
new
york
pays
$278.00
a
month,
missouri
pays
$124.00,
mississippi
pays
$55.00
a
month
and
even
the
district
of
columbia
where
congress
is
4537
pays
$184.00
a
month
on
the
average
which
is
about
2/3's
of
what
new
york
pays.
now,
while
imposing
various
other
requirements
as
a
condition
of
receiving
federal
grants,
congress
has
deliberately
refrain
from
mandating
levels
and
indeed
it
even
perpetuates
to
some
extent
the
inequity
between
the
states
by
scaling
the
ratio
of
the
federal
contribution
so
as
to
give
more
money
for
the
state's
that
pay
less
paradoxically
enough.
and
indeed
in
king
against
smith
which
was
decided
after
602
(a)
(23)
was
enacted
by
the
67th
congress,
this
court
said
“each
state
is
free
to
determine
the
level
of
benefits
by
the
amount
of
funds
that
devotes
for
the
program.”
the
statute
requires
an
increase
in
the
standard
of
need,
there's
no
question
about
that
and
new
york
complied
with
that
by
its
reprising
in
1968
and
it's
again
reprised
in
1969.
the
bill
when
it
was
originally
introduced
by
the
administration
made
significant
changes
which
never
took
effect
because
congress
didn't
see
it
the
way
hew
saw
it.
the
bill
has
introduced
required
each
state
to
pay
the
full
standard
of
need
which
as
we've
seen
would
be
a
gigantic
step
forward
in
the
whole
administration
of
welfare
and
many
states,
26
according
the
count
we
took,
don't
even
pay
their
own
acknowledged
standard
of
need.
in
effect
they
say
to
a
family,
“we
know
you
need
$300.00
a
month
or
whatever
it
is
but
we're
not
going
to
give
you
$300.00
a
month.”
the
bill
also
required
an
annual
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
and
since
it
required
each
state
to
pay
the
standard
of
need,
it
required
an
annual
adjustment
of
the
amount
actually
paid
to
every
afdc
recipient.
this
would've
been
a
bill
of
enormous
impact
but
the
house
turned
it
down
and
the
senate,
while
passing
a
portion
of
it
only
passed
the
annual
updating
part
so
where
in
effect
when
it
finally
got
through,
it
was
emasculated
and
then
the
house-senate
conference
committee
further
emasculated
it
by
eliminating
the
annual
updating
and
leaving
it
as
it
is
with
a
simple
one-shot
updating
of
the
standard
of
need
requirement
and
no
requirements
at
all
that
a
state
increased
the
amount
actually
paid.
mr.
philip
weinberg
presumably
they
would,
but
whatever
they
might
be
planning
to
do
in
the
future
and
of
course
since
then
as
the
court
knows,
there's
been
many
proposals
which
will
change
the
whole
field
of
welfare
around.
whatever
congress
might
have
been
thinking
about
doing
in
the
future,
they
didn't
do
very
much
in
1967.
it's
significant
that
in
the
field
of
old
ages
systems
not
involved
in
this
case.
they
raised
the
actual
amounts
paid
$4.00
a
month.
they
appropriated
money
specifically
for
that
purpose,
they
eluded
to
it
in
their
committee
reports
and
so
on
and
the
fact
that
that
is
no
reference
in
the
committee
reports
to
any
similar
provision
here
and
no
propose
appropriation
made
it
all.
it's
evident
that
they
had
no
such
intent
in
passing
602
(a)
(23)
to
do
anything
analogous
to
that
in
the
field
of
afdc.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
we
did
it.
we
did
it
in
1968.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
would
have
done
it
anyway
because
all
statute
requires
that
in
any
of
that
we
certainly
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
although,
unquestionably
it
did
comply
with
what
congress
said.
and
as
we've
seen
the
conference
committee
then
eliminated
annual
updating
and
the
language
of
their
report
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
significant.
it
said
it
requires
one
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
before
july
1,
1969
and
the
hew
in
characterizing
this
provision
in
the
amicus
brief
they
put
it
in
lampton
against
bonin
that
louisiana
case,
which
is
referred
to
continuously
through
this
whole
case,
used
the
phrase
that
congress
could've
hardly
paid
less
attention
to
it
when
they
passed
602
(a)
(23).
and
yet
the
petitioners
would
have
us
believed
that
this
bill
was
some
sort
of
a
trojan
horse
ironically
brought
in
by
the
opponents
of
welfare
reform
as
it
reflected
by
the
way
the
senate
vote
worked
out,
and
opposed
by
the
people
who
seek
higher
levels
of
welfare.
it's
--
it's
evidence
from
the
legislative
history
here
aside
from
the
plain
meaning
of
this
little
statute
that
congress
rejected
a
provision
for
actually
requiring
every
state
to
meet
its
standard
of
need
and
it
simply
require
that
the
standard
be
updated
which
as
we've
seen
and
new
york
would've
done
anyway.
in
the
recent
proposals
of
the
president
in
the
field
of
welfare,
is
significant
that
the
president
remarked
it
for
the
first
time
under
the
proposals
now
being
annunciated.
all
dependent
families
with
children
would
be
assured
of
minimum
standard
payments.
now,
we've
seen
that
new
york
has
no
maximums
such
as
it
was
involved
in
williams
against
dandridge.
that's
conceded
and
so
i
don't
think
it
merits
any
further
discussion.
now,
this
brings
us
to
a
further
and
extremely
difficult
point.
the
fact
is
that
this
statute
requires
no
more
than
a
one-shot
adjustment
of
the
standard
of
need
and
that
inescapably
raises
a
question
of
fundamental
jurisdiction
over
and
above
the
question
of
ripeness.
supposed
the
petitioners
construction
of
the
statute
were
correct,
then
it
would
place
the
judiciary
in
a
position
of
having
to
categorically
order
the
new
york
legislature,
assuming
that
this
court
found
we
didn't
comply,
to
disperse
money
from
each
treasury
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
any
constitutional
infirmity
such
as
it
was
involved
in
king
against
smith.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
forbids
such
an
interpretation
and
in
williams
against
dandridge,
the
three-judge
of
court
reach
the
same
conclusion.
what
this
is,
is
in
reality
a
thinly
veiled
suit
to
compel
the
new
york
legislature
to
appropriate
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
all
--
they
asked
me
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
sir
the
petitioner
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
a
great
deal
more
than
they're
asking
for
injunction.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don't
believe
it
does.
i
think
the
injunction
which
is
what
this
court
of
appeals
said
would
be
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
declaratory
judgement
would
still
be
in
effect
in
order
or
it
wouldn't
be
an
injunction
but
it
would
be
virtually
in
order
compelling
the
state
legislature
appropriate
for
money.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
what
we've
been
insisted
throughout
the
whole
litigation,
no
question
about
it.
it
would
--
there's
just
no
way
to
avoid
that
problem.
assuming
the
state
were
ineligible
--
were
violated
of
602
(a)
(23)
at
the
most
that
would
mean
that
we
were
ineligible
to
receive
federal
funds.
mr.
philip
weinberg
then
that
would
eliminate
the
unripeness
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
still
be
the
basic
question
that
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
which
i'd
like
to
get
to
admit
it.
mr.
philip
weinberg
assumed
--
not
just
on
the
unripeness,
justice
white,
but
also
on
other
questions.
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
assuming
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
assuming
it
were
right
by
hew
passing
on
it,
that
would
bring
and
assuming
that
you
would
prepare
to
rule
that
new
york
didn't
comply,
that
would
bring
us
up
to
the
question,
i
was
just
starting
to
address
myself
to,
could
the
court
order
in
effect
whether
by
declaratory
judgement
or
injunction,
could
the
court
order
the
new
york
legislature
disperse
additional
money
for
welfare
without
violating
the
eleventh
amendment
and
a
whole
volume
of
case
law
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
this
wasn't
involved
in
king
against
smith.
because
in
king
against
smith
and
then
the
residency
cases
as
well,
there
was
a
way
for
the
state
to
comply
by
simply
shuffling
amounts
--
shuffling
around
the
amount
of
money
that
it
was
going
to
spend
for
welfare.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
i'll
be
finishing
up
in
a
moment.
when
we
turn
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
here
is
that
once
the
equal
protection
claim
of
the
geographical
differential
between
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
state
was
mooted
as
it
was,
there
remained
only
the
statutory
claim.
and
there
was
simply
no
authority
for
the
judiciary
entertaining
that
claim.
the
petitioners
have
tried
to
avoid
that
problem
by
saying
that
dependent
jurisdiction
doctrine
gets
them
over
that
hurdle,
but
it
simple
doesn't
because
this
court
held
in
united
mine
workers
against
gibbs
and
as
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
on
many
occasions
when
the
only
constitutional
issue
in
the
case,
the
only
issue
where
there's
federal
jurisdiction
is
knocked
out
early
in
the
case
then
for
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
would
amount
to
the
non-justiciable
tail
wagging
the
justiciable
dog,
as
the
court
very
colorfully
put
it
in
one
of
the
cases
and
that
that's
simply
what
we
have
here
so
pending
jurisdictions
have
no
assistance
to
the
petitioners.
they
rely
on
1331
but
it's
clear
that
they
don't
have
$10,000.00
here
to
talk
about
and
as
this
court
held
in
schneider
against
harris
individual
plaintiffs
and
a
class
suit
can't
aggregate
their
claims
in
order
to
try
to
reach
the
$10,000.00
requirement.
they
also
rely
on
1343
and
42
u.s.c.
1983
the
classic
civil
right
statutes,
but
the
fallacy
there,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
was
that
402
(a)
(23)
simply
can't
be
construed
as
a
statute
designed
to
bring
about
civil
rights.
what
it
does,
is
a
statute
which
really
perpetuates
in
inequity
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
effect
at
all.
it
--
it
locks
the
states
into
the
extraordinarily
inequitable
amounts
of
welfare
assistance
that
they
pay.
this
statute
as
enacted
requires
the
states
to
adjust
their
standard
of
need
and
new
york
did
so.
it's
a
narrow
statute
and
this
is
a
narrow
case.
there
are
many
defects
in
the
welfare
system
as
we
look
at
it
throughout
the
whole
country
and
there've
been
many
proposals
for
solution
but
the
congress
has
itself
maintained
as
we've
seen
vast
and
equalities
by
its
refusal
to
act
and
equalize
the
payments
in
the
various
states.
to
adopt
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
would
not
end
these
severe
inequities.
and
to
argue
that
new
york
contravened
it,
when
it
so
plainly
didn't
and
that
any
non-conformity
between
this
new
york
state
statute
and
602
(a)
(23)
would
void
the
entire
state
program
in
the
absence
of
any
claim
of
unconstitutionality
or
discrimination.
it's
simply
at
odds
with
the
plain
meaning
of
their
statute
and
its
an
invitation
to
just
that
sort
of
judicial
consideration
of
questions
of
legislative
policy
of
the
states,
which
this
court
since
the
cases
in
the
1930's
has
correctly
resisted.
the
order
of
appeal
from
should
be
affirmed.
