mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
has
in
continuous
to
participate
in
the
federal
aid
families
with
dependent
children
program.
under
which
congress
makes
available
to
it,
approximately
$400
million
federal
dollars
a
year
and
imposes
on
the
receipt
and
use
of
those
dollars
federal
terms
and
conditions.
this
case
of
argues
are
one
of
those
recently
and
active
of
those
conditions,
section
4028-23
or
condition
23
of
the
social
security
act.
who
is
meaning
in
this
case
is
critically
an
issue
and
in
two
other
cases
now
on
being
appealed
to
this
court
and
other
cases
pending
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
cases
in
this
--
the
issues
in
this
case
to
be
sure
are
numerous
in
complex.
in
light
of
the
limited
time
available
we
should
like
to
take
them
up
in
the
following
order.
we
should
like
to
begin
with
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
we
believe
that
meaning
is
clear
on
its
phase
and
from
its
legislative
evolution
and
then
discuss
the
arguments
made
against
that
meaning
and
third
change
whether
a
united
district
court
may
so
construed
statute
and
apply
it
in
new
york
and
other
states.
we
begin
with
the
obvious
but
important
observation
that
it
is
a
statute
we
are
construing
passed
in
our
national
legislative
process
in
which
the
states
are
not
into
the
minorities
or
unheard
voices.
this
statute
like
all
other
acts
of
congress;
seeks
to
obviate
some
evil
has
some
name
seeks
to
work
some
change
in
policy.
it
has,
in
other
words,
some
intelligible
meaning
and
some
intelligible
purpose.
we
believe
that
the
meaning
urged
by
us
in
this
case
and
adopted
by
the
district
judge
below
is
the
only
meaning
consistent
with
the
language,
its
history
and
consistent
with
any
intelligible
purpose.
the
numerous
other
meanings
proffered
to
the
statute
by
new
york,
by
other
states,
by
the
department
health
education
and
welfare
reduce
congressional
will
to
a
meaningless
exercise
and
futility.
the
terms
used
in
the
statute
are
not
unheard
of
or
unfamiliar
in
public
assistance
administration.
the
amounts
used
to
determine
the
needs
of
individuals
is
a
comprehensive
description
of
a
states
need
standard,
long
established
and
public
assistance
to
determine
how
much
aid
an
individual
is
entitled
to.
the
second
phrase
we
force
to
any
maximums,
those
are
devices
used
by
states
to
reduce
the
amount
of
a
below
that
of
state
recognized
need.
an
adjustment
to
the
first
device
in
any
state
to
pays
need
in
full
that
doesn't
impose
any
maximum
automatically
results
in
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
recipients.
an
adjustment
to
the
need
standard
and
any
maximum
similarly
results
in
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
states
with
maximums.
that
the
latter
increase
is
proportionate
to
the
extent
of
the
state
might
need
in
a
given
base
period.
the
statute
by
looking
to
the
amounts
used
and
the
time
they
were
last
established
refers
through
the
state
standard
that
made
during
some
base
period.
that
base
period
is
the
time
of
an
act
into
the
statute
in
january
1968.
the
off
shot
of
the
exercise
is
that
states
are
commanded
to
maintain
their
grant
levels
with
one
adjustment
to
keep
pace
with
living
costs
by
july
1,
1969.
the
effect
in
all
states
is
equal
in
so
far
as
the
conditions
the
states
need
standard
in
each
date
is
accepted
the
maximum
that
it
was
paying
during
a
given
base
period
is
accepted.
we
think
that
the
legislative
background
of
this
statute
but
confirms
this
meaning.
it
was
treated
--
it
was
developed
in
the
senate.
it
stemmed
from
the
administration's
proposal
that
was
quite
a
bit
more
far
reaching.
that
proposal
required
not
only
annual
updating
of
the
state's
standard
of
need
but
it
also
required
that
all
states
pay
need
in
full
and
there
were
at
that
time
33
states
that
did
not
pay
in
full,
many
of
which
did
not
pay
more
than
50%
of
needs
somewhat
less.
our
position
to
that
statute
in
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
for
the
house
and
senate
committees
centered
primarily
on
the
effect
of
the
full
need
requirements
in
those
states
that
have
long
not
met
the
standard
that
need
that
affect
being
very
large
change
not
on
modest
updating
but
something
much
larger
than
that.
the
administration's
estimate
for
the
total
cost
of
that
bill
though,
it's
important
to
realize,
was
$90
million
for
paying
full
need
of
federal
sharing
that
is
i'm
sorry.
and
$95
million
for
annual
updating
of
standards
that
were
being
paid
in
full
not
the
case
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
senate
finance
committee
modified
that
statute
dropping
the
full
need
requirement
adding
in
its
stead
that
any
maximums
be
proportionately
adjusted.
it
was
passed
by
the
senate
committee
on
a
party
line
vote,
it
was
passed
by
the
senate,
went
to
the
conference
committee
where
they
amended
it
to
drop
just
one
part
of
it
the
annual
reprising
requirement.
the
wording
of
the
language
of
the
provision
remains
the
same
however
from
the
time
that
remerged
from
the
senate
finance
committee
to
the
time
it
was
signed
by
the
president
on
january
the
2nd,
1968.
both
committees
reported
the
bill
out,
i'm
sorry,
the
conference
committee
and
the
senate
finance
committee
reported
bill
out
under
a
heading
increasing
income
of
recipients.
the
bill
was
considered
along
side
a
companion
proposal
to
require
the
states
to
increase
payments
in
the
adult
programs
by
$7.00
and
average
increase
of
$7.50.
and
the
method
chosen
for
that
increase
was
the
adjustment
of
need
standards
and
maximums.
it
is
in
short
we
think
this
history
make
several
things
clear.
one,
the
402
(a)
(23)
is
a
self-evident
departure
from
tradition
in
so
far
as
it
requires
a
modest
adjustment
to
state
need
standards
and
levels
of
payments
in
afdc,
self-evident
and
quite
obvious
to
the
specialist
committees
dealing
with
social
security
legislation
and
certainly
obvious
to
any
congressman
who
took
the
time
to
look
at
it.
two,
the
evolution
of
the
bill
makes
clear
that
it
was
a
compromise,
it
was
not
to
establish
the
floor
of
income
in
every
state
that
would
be
approached
adequacy
as
the
administration
had
originally
urged.
nothing
of
the
kind,
it
rather
was
to
see
that
each
state
paid
at
least
of
what
it
was
then
paying
which
was
renowned
for
all
states
to
be
inadequate
and
to
make
one
adjustment
to
keep
phase
with
living
costs.
it
should
be
added
in
the
administration,
reported
to
the
committees
that
most
states
had
updated
in
1966
or
1967.
there
was
no
great
impact
expected
from
the
required
updating
by
july
1,
1969,
particularly
one
state
maximum
were
accepted.
we
think
this
legislative
history
also
makes
clear,
the
companion
proposal
makes
clear
that
congress
appreciate
the
effect
of
adjusting
this
mechanisms.
the
language
chosen,
the
comprehensive
term
used
to
describe
the
state
needs
standard
plus
the
fact
that
goes
on
to
require
adjustment
to
maximums
leaves
little
room
for
nullification
or
evasion.
and
finally,
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
made
this
a
planned
condition
for
continued
participation
in
afdc
and
gave
the
states
a
one
year
and
a
half
to
make
the
required
adjustments
i
think
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
to
compel
the
states
to
do
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
oh,
i
think
a
state
in
applying
conditions
in
the
afdc
title
mr.
justice
brennan
certainly
contemplate
that
the
state
may
or
may
not
participate
in
the
program.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
brennan,
well
this
is
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
supremacy
clause,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
controlling
only
to
the
extent
if
the
state
participates
in
the
federal
program
receives
and
uses
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
most
certainly
so
it
is
we
aren't
seeking
to
enforce
one
of
the
plan
conditions
that
congress
has
imposed
in
the
received
of
federal
moneys.
just
as
the
alternative
ground
in
king
against
smith
was
the
enforcement
of
the
another
planned
condition,
condition
number
10-a
shall
be
furnished
to
all
eligible
individuals
was
enforced
by
the
petitioners,
was
invoked
by
the
petitioners
in
that
case
to
support
their
claim
that
alabama's
substitute
for
the
rule
was
invalid.
this
court
said
that
alabama
had
breached
its
federally
imposed
obligation
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
in
conflict
with
the
social
security
act
in
a
state
that's
participating
of
course,
is
to
that
extent
invalid.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
that
congress
has
given
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
the
power
to
terminate
federal
funds
upon
finding
a
conflict
between
a
state
plan
requirement
and
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there's
no
administrative
procedure
or
proceeding
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
this
power
in
hew
which
it
may
exercise.
it
has
in
fact
not
exercised
it
not
only
here
but
in
any
other
case
that
we
know
of
except
for
two
since
the
act
was
passed
the
power
being
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
no
different
than
any
other
the
act
contemplates
or
when
a
state
makes
a
change
in
its
amtc.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
it's
not
scheduled
detour
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'll
explain
what
did
happened.
the
state
made
a
change,
they
have
to
submit
that
to
hew.
for
some
reasons,
state
has
permitted
to
implement
it
prior
to
hew's
approval
and
federal
funds
continued
to
flow
and
in
this
particular
case
and
then
a
series
of
discussions
when
negotiations
take
place
between
the
state
and
hew
over
the
change
if
it
raises
questions.
this
provision
was
deemed
to
raise
question
in
hew
and
somewhat
uncharacteristically
swift
fashion
replied
to
new
york
that
section
131
(a),
the
statute
which
reduces
grants
raised
the
question
of
conformity
under
the
social
security
act
would
you
provide
us
with
information.
that
was
in
april,
new
york
provided
the
regulations
and
a
brief
description
of
what
the
statute
does
in
june
and
nothing
further
has
been
heard
between
hew
and
state
of
new
york
except
for
an
event
we
just
learned
recently
that
took
place
on
november
10
in
which
hew
wrote
new
york
a
letter
questioning
some
other
aspect
of
131
(a)
on
the
grounds
of
state
wide
uniformity
under
social
security
act.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
it's
our
view
that
the
delegation
to
hew
with
the
power
to
cut
off
federal
funds
does
not
preclude
the
remedy
that
this
court
upheld
in
king
against
smith.
that
remedy
being
a
recipient
most
affected
by
state
plan
changes
in
afdc
and
the
other
programs.
may
i
ask
--
it
may
invoke
the
federal
laws
so
long
as
the
state
is
participating
and
a
court
has
power
to
adjudicate
that
controversy.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
between
this
case
and
king
v.
smith,
in
king
v.
smith
hew
had
the
neither
approved
nor
disapproved.
it
had
a
long
history
of
negotiation.
we
have
a
somewhat
shorter
history
of
negotiation
here
but
given
the
nature
of
the
interest
involved
and
also
the
fact
that
hew's
participation
or
expertise
be
at
being
relevant
is
available
to
this
court
or
the
court
below.
indeed
hew
has
very
explicitly
expressed
its
views
in
this
case
and
those
were
before
the
district
court
and
its
brief
from
another
case
and
deregulation.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
all
right,
it
doesn't
and
the
hew
was
invited
to
participate
in
this
case
amicus
at
the
beginning.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
one
of
the
critical
issues
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
quite
often
the
case
mr.
justice
white,
it
didn't
really
advice
the
court,
for
example
it
did
not
advice
the
court
or
anyone
else
in
king
against
smith
exactly
what
its
position
on
substitute
for
the
rules
were.
it
has
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
had
--
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
certainly
the
meandering
or
long
protracted
serious
in
negotiations
or
very
indefinite
negotiations
certainly
is
a
characteristic
of
that
process.
it's
not
really
an
adversary
process.
recipients
are
not
the
parties
to
it,
the
states
are
not
really
adversaries
except
in
the
rare
instance
where
hew
invokes
its
power
of
cut
off
and
as
we
said
it's
very
rare
and
he
invokes
that
power.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
not
at
all
mr.
chief
justice,
i
merely
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
saying
that
that
power
of
hew
to
order
to
cutoff
the
federal
funds
does
not
affect
the
rights
of
recipients
to
come
in
to
federal
court
in
a
due
to
case
validity
under
the
federal
act
of
the
state
law
of
regulation
or
statute
adversity
affects
them
in
this
one
most
adversity
affect
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
we're
just
saying
similarly
to
allen
v.
board
of
elections
--
this
court's
decision
in
allen
v.
board
of
elections.
the
existence
of
administrative
remedy,
the
power
to
cut
off
does
not
preclude
adjudication.
the
united
states
itself
has
said
so
in
regard
to
the
social
security
act.
it
has
come
in
to
court
and
argued
that
hew's
power
to
terminate
is
not
exclusive.
the
courts
have
power
to
adjudicate
validity.
we
think
that
power
is
critical
and
very
important.
we
mention
the
nature
of
these
negotiations
only
to
show
how
critical
and
important
that
power
is
if
the
client
conditions
that
congress
imposes
are
to
be
enforced.
if
in
fact
the
protections,
the
few
protections
that
congress
provides
to
disadvantage
individuals
alleged
or
under
these
programs
are
to
be
effectuated.
we
stressed
the
delay
in
hew
seems
only
to
show
that
a
fact
of
this
court
has
recognize
that
is
that
the
congress
usually
intends
its
laws
to
be
applicable
to
be
enforced.
it
usually
intends
its
policies
to
be
carried
out
if
those
policies
are
to
be
effectuated
in
this
case
and
other
cases
surely
the
answer
given
in
king
against
smith
was
correct.
they
can
come
into
court
and
seek
to
adjudicate.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
i
fought
them
in
this
case.
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
we
believe
in
our
view
is
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute
which
is
a
questionable
obviously
ultimately
for
this
court.
we
think
in
the
line
of
the
policy
of
this
statute
it's
a
question
that
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
that
certainly
i
just
wanted
to
make--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
believed
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
government
did
volunteer
brief
in
this
court
very
recently
and
mentions
a
few
hints
of
something
right
or
wrong,
it
doesn't
want
to
take
the
position
on
the
merits
for
one
reason
or
another.
hew
also
was
issued
to
state
letter,
by
the
way,
which
is
not
a
regulation
of
october
10th
which
rather
studiedly
begs
this
question.
it
says
at
a
minimum
you
must
maintain
your
standards
and
accordance
with
basic
needs
without
providing
us
with
the
definition
of
basic
needs
at
all.
nor
thus,
i
don't
think
fairly
construed
as
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
i
should
like
first
to
return
to
the
arguments
against
this
statute
which
are
said
to
make
our
meaning
inappropriate.
the
basic
argument
is
that
the
statute
is
we
construe
it,
renders
it
to
be
a
measure
working
enormous
change
in
the
federal
state
relationship
on
president
grant
made
programs
at
considerable
compelled
expenditures
and
without
stormy
opposition
in
congress
that
such
a
measure
should
have
resulted
in.
we
think
the
argument
falls
with
each
of
those
premises.
the
cost
of
this
provision
were
before
the
congress,
it
knew
that
the
administration's
original
provision
requiring
a
great
deal
of
more
change
would
cost
overall
$90
million
in
federal
funds
for
full
payment
updated
standards
for
updating
it
full
and
then
paying
those
standards
in
full.
once
that
provision
was
draw
up
to
full
need,
the
cost
had
to
drop
considerably
because
it
was
accepting
maximums
in
33
states;
many
of
which
states
don't
claim
one
in
50%
of
need.
the
administration
had
also
informed
congress
that
most
states
are
updated
recently.
the
cost,
in
other
words,
were
modest
to
stay
the
least
in
a
program
of
$4
billion
federal
expenditures
a
year.
those
cost
range
if
one
takes
the
national
average
of
hew
of
$44
a
recipient
a
year
and
a
10%
cost
of
living
factor,
the
total
cost
would
be
about
$30
million
gross
state
and
federal
expenditures.
this
case
appears
to
be
a
very
big
case
in
terms
of
cost
and
the
source
supports
the
argument
not
because
new
york
has
made
a
cost
of
living
adjustment,
it
estimated
the
cost
of
living
adjustment
and
sound
budget
for
this
year
it
would
$5
million
the
state
share
all
together.
it's
because
what
new
york
has
done
is
cut
grants
and
cut
grants
very
severely.
that
is
not
to
thrust
of
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
passed
this
statute.
any
given
violation
of
a
federal
condition
can
be
costly
if
one
takes
the
condition
in
king
against
smith
and
against
a
state,
for
example
new
york
decides
to
withdraw
aid
to
all
children
whose
parents
have
abandoned
them
and
those
petitioners
invoke
402
(a)
(10).
the
cost
involve
in
that
case
will
be
about
$200
million.
but
that
was
not
the
cost
that
congress
estimated
for
402
(a)
(10)
or
had
in
mind.
although,
it
did
passed
that
provision
to
deal
with
physical
crisis
in
the
states
nor
is
this
provision.
but
my
point
is
the
cost
are
indeed
modest,
two
this
is
not
on
president
and
federal
granted
programs.
our
contention
it
should
be
clear
as
not
the
402
(a)
(23)
compels
the
state
to
appropriate
certain
amount
of
money
of
afdc.
it
rather,
it
poses
a
limit
on
one
mechanism
to
be
use
to
reduce
expenditures
that
mechanism
being
the
reduction
of
grants.
the
medicate
program
passed
for
two
years
before
also
a
federal
grant
made
program
with
similar
matching
50%
the
new
york
and
of
fair
percentage
for
other
states,
imposes
very
similar
requirements
but
rather
more
and
those
were
passed
without
controversy.
that
act
requires
not
only
that
states
may
not
divert
funds
from
the
public
assistance
titles
to
operate
medicate,
it
requires
that
the
states
must
at
a
minimum
provide
a
to
persons
who
would
be
eligible
for
public
assistance
under
the
most
liberal
money-payment
standard
in
the
states
during
the
last
three
years
and
it
also
provides
that
the
state
must
at
a
minimum
that
the
state
must
provide
to
all
eligible
individuals
at
least
five
categories
of
services
in-patient,
out-patient
hospital
physicians
and
the
like.
the
sum
total
of
those
requirements
is
most
and
it
also
requires
the
states
expand
demonstrate
their
expanding
reference
under
medicate.
my
point
is
the
sum
total
of
those
requirements
is
indeed
to
impose
a
limit
on
the
ability
of
the
state
to
participate
and
choose
to
spend
what
it
wishes,
not
a
rigid
limit
but
this
is
not
a
rigid
limit
either.
this
provision
leaves
safe
with
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
not
to
reduce
grants
which
should
be
said,
but
in
other
areas
to
affect
their
afdc
budget
of
public
welfare
expenditures.
states
are
free
within
very
broad
limits
to
determine
eligibility,
financial
responsibility
of
relatives,
implementation
of
the
win
program,
the
work
consented
program,
certainly
the
amount
of
local
financial
participation
and
the
like.
we
think
that
this
court
did
refer
in
king
against
smith
to
the
state
power
to
determine
its
resources
through
setting
of
standards
of
need.
but
that's
an
example
of
flexibility.
there
were
many
other
examples
that
can
be
adduced.
burrow
with
the
departure
in
this
provision
is
done
so
by
reflecting
most
to
the
very
established
pattern
in
afdc,
it
accepts
as
it
has
the
government
has
since
1935,
the
enormous
variations
among
the
several
states
in
resources
and
the
like
and
a
lot
of
this
states
and
accepts
the
states
own
standard
of
need.
it
also
continues
greater
federal
responsibility
for
states
with
lesser
wealth
and
lower
grant
that's
a
pattern
or
a
tradition
in
afdc.
even
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the
provision
should
have
been
controversial,
this
is
really
torrential
out
of
its
legislative
setting
in
1967.
after
all,
it
was
part
of
omnibus
legislative
amendment,
also
part
of
a
compromise
between
the
senate
and
the
house
which
disputed
over
many
provisions.
this
was
one
their
compromises
and
this
setting,
the
absence
of
and
it
was
also
passed
in
under
passed
on
the
floor.
under
rules
are
very
restricted
debate
and
no
amendments
in
the
house
certainly
and
at
the
end
of
the
senate,
no
amendments
also.
in
this
setting
silence
even
by
those
who
should
have
opposed
that
assuming
there
should've
been
such
persons,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
part
of
the
legislative
art
of
reaching
a
compromise
and
accord
on
no
less
than
300
different
provisions
that
were
embodied
in
its
1967
amendments.
we'll
refer
to
now
to
the
new
york
statute
and
whether
what
it
does
is
somehow
consistent
with
the
402
(a)
(23).
in
our
view
the
heart
of
402
(a)
(23)
is
to
guarantee
an
increase
in
income
of
recipients
as
the
committee
said
based
on
cost
of
living
changes.
new
york
has
done
is
decrease
the
income
of
recipients
by
approximately
8
to
12%
depending
on
which
recipient,
i'll
talk
about
the
changes
in
a
moment
and
its
clearly
done
did
this
to
reduce
overall
afdc
expenditures
in
new
york
by
$100
million
out
of
a
total
of
approximately
$900
million.
that's
a
one
out
of
every
$9.00
was
taken
out
of
the
afdc.
how
that
can
be
said
to
comply
with
the
statute,
how
the
adjustment
of
needs
standards,
new
york
does
not
have
maximums,
how
the
adjustment
of
need
standards
can
be
said
which
saved
which
reduces
everybody's
grant
by
$1.00
out
of
$9.00
can
be
said
to
comply
with
the
statute
that
requires
an
adjustment
for
cost
for
a
reprising
for
cost
of
living
changes
obviously
going
up
is
itself
startling
proposition.
our
view
on
mr.
justice
brennan,
your
question
of
streamlining
is
402
(a)
(23)
has
nothing
to
do
with
streamlining,
that
is
not
the
concern
of
the
statute,
its
proponents
or
anyone
else
who
discussed
that
never
talk
about
streamlining.
one
should
have
is
no
federal
statute
or
federal
regulation
that
defines
what
streamlining
is
either.
states
have
like
new
york;
they
have
used
several
methods
of
providing
grants.
one
of
those
methods
is
to
provide
the
grant
as
a
supplement
as
it
does
for
example
for
rent
today
as
it
did
for
articles
of
home
furnishing
and
clothing.
we
don't
think
that
402
(a)
(23)
allows
the
state
to
eliminate
whatever
items
it
now
deems
unnecessary
and
unnecessary
for
reasons
have
nothing
to
do
with
basic
--
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
know
of
no
case
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
or
primary
jurisdiction
in
which
the
litigant
being
harmed
by
a
statute
has
no
access
to
that
agency
and
may
not
initiate
any
proceeding
and
may
not
participate
in
any
proceeding
before
it.
we
think
that
that
was
obvious
to
this
court
in
king
against
smith,
in
damico
against
california
and
in
salmon
against
shapiro.
we
don't
think
that
that
requires
a
reexamination;
we
don't
think
it
should
be
--
we
don't
think
the
rule
should
be
any
different
in
this
case.
the
result
of
a
decree
in
this
case
is
not
necessarily
greater
or
lesser
than
any
other
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
after
all,
in
king
against
smith,
alabama
reduced
its
roles
by
25%
through
its
substitute
for
the
rule,
that's
lot
of
people.
true,
it
could
turned
to
its
benefit
levels
that's
a
lot
of
money
involved
in
king
v.
smith,
the
louisiana
sued
the
home
ruins,
similarly
involved
a
great
deal
of
many
people.
there's
no
intrinsic
or
(inaudible)
in
age
distinction
between
benefit
levels
and
scope
with
eligibility
very
much
depends
on
the
case.
this
court
is
not
called
upon
to
decide
whether
new
york
has
eliminated
basic
items
or
non-basic
items.
section
402
(a)
(23)
does
talk
after
all
of
the
items
used
to
determine
need.
in
the
context
of
this
case
however
find
questions
about
an
item
a
need
no
longer
existing,
it
does
not
arise
or
find
questions
that
the
state
substituting
oil
for
coal
as
a
way
of
fulfilling
your
need
for
fuel.
those
kinds
of
questions
are
not
before
this
court.
as
the
findings
below
amply
support
it
may
clear,
this
is
an
overall
streamlining
so
to
speak
to
reduce
welfare
afdc
expenditures
for
one
year
in
new
york
by
$100
million
as
the
hew
makes
clear
for
july
1969.
its
average
went
from
$71.00
per
person
to
$62.00
per
person.
i
--
there's
something
more
going
on
there
than
so
called
streamlining.
moreover,
if
one
looks
to
the
two
primary
ways
new
york
accomplished
this,
it
took
to
age
differentiated
schedules
giving
a
great
deal
more
for
older
children
and
did
a
way
with
the
differentials
for
older
children
not
because
they
don't
have
greater
requirements
for
food
or
social
or
educational
necessities,
but
because
it
wanted
to
save
money.
it
justifies
that
at
some
sort
of
convenience
in
administration
by
saying
“we'd
have
to
change
it
every
two
years
otherwise.”
new
recertifies
individuals
every
three
months
and
makes
countless
adjustments
to
the
grant
every
month
for
every
dollar
of
resource
or
income
received
on
any
individual.
how
new
york
is
saying
“let's
look
at
two
figures
in
a
chart
and
to
have
to
make
an
adjustment
and
adc
families
granting
to
every
two
years.”
somehow,
its
administrative
inefficiency
boggles
the
imagination.
the
large
other
item
eliminated
are
supplementary
grants
for
clothing
and
home
furnishings.
those
were
administered
in
new
york
as
a
flat
grant
not
a
special
grant.
no
one
applied
for
it.
they
got
a
check
in
the
mail
every
quarter
of
$25.00
per
person.
there's
no
administrative
efficiency
in
eliminating
that
whatsoever,
there's
cost
saving
and
nothing
more.
thank
you.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york
has
in
continuous
to
participate
in
the
federal
aid
families
with
dependent
children
program.
under
which
congress
makes
available
to
it,
approximately
$400
million
federal
dollars
a
year
and
imposes
on
the
receipt
and
use
of
those
dollars
federal
terms
and
conditions.
this
case
of
argues
are
one
of
those
recently
and
active
of
those
conditions,
section
4028-23
or
condition
23
of
the
social
security
act.
who
is
meaning
in
this
case
is
critically
an
issue
and
in
two
other
cases
now
on
being
appealed
to
this
court
and
other
cases
pending
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
cases
in
this
--
the
issues
in
this
case
to
be
sure
are
numerous
in
complex.
in
light
of
the
limited
time
available
we
should
like
to
take
them
up
in
the
following
order.
we
should
like
to
begin
with
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
we
believe
that
meaning
is
clear
on
its
phase
and
from
its
legislative
evolution
and
then
discuss
the
arguments
made
against
that
meaning
and
third
change
whether
a
united
district
court
may
so
construed
statute
and
apply
it
in
new
york
and
other
states.
we
begin
with
the
obvious
but
important
observation
that
it
is
a
statute
we
are
construing
passed
in
our
national
legislative
process
in
which
the
states
are
not
into
the
minorities
or
unheard
voices.
this
statute
like
all
other
acts
of
congress;
seeks
to
obviate
some
evil
has
some
name
seeks
to
work
some
change
in
policy.
it
has,
in
other
words,
some
intelligible
meaning
and
some
intelligible
purpose.
we
believe
that
the
meaning
urged
by
us
in
this
case
and
adopted
by
the
district
judge
below
is
the
only
meaning
consistent
with
the
language,
its
history
and
consistent
with
any
intelligible
purpose.
the
numerous
other
meanings
proffered
to
the
statute
by
new
york,
by
other
states,
by
the
department
health
education
and
welfare
reduce
congressional
will
to
a
meaningless
exercise
and
futility.
the
terms
used
in
the
statute
are
not
unheard
of
or
unfamiliar
in
public
assistance
administration.
the
amounts
used
to
determine
the
needs
of
individuals
is
a
comprehensive
description
of
a
states
need
standard,
long
established
and
public
assistance
to
determine
how
much
aid
an
individual
is
entitled
to.
the
second
phrase
we
force
to
any
maximums,
those
are
devices
used
by
states
to
reduce
the
amount
of
a
below
that
of
state
recognized
need.
an
adjustment
to
the
first
device
in
any
state
to
pays
need
in
full
that
doesn't
impose
any
maximum
automatically
results
in
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
recipients.
an
adjustment
to
the
need
standard
and
any
maximum
similarly
results
in
a
cost
of
living
increase
to
states
with
maximums.
that
the
latter
increase
is
proportionate
to
the
extent
of
the
state
might
need
in
a
given
base
period.
the
statute
by
looking
to
the
amounts
used
and
the
time
they
were
last
established
refers
through
the
state
standard
that
made
during
some
base
period.
that
base
period
is
the
time
of
an
act
into
the
statute
in
january
1968.
the
off
shot
of
the
exercise
is
that
states
are
commanded
to
maintain
their
grant
levels
with
one
adjustment
to
keep
pace
with
living
costs
by
july
1,
1969.
the
effect
in
all
states
is
equal
in
so
far
as
the
conditions
the
states
need
standard
in
each
date
is
accepted
the
maximum
that
it
was
paying
during
a
given
base
period
is
accepted.
we
think
that
the
legislative
background
of
this
statute
but
confirms
this
meaning.
it
was
treated
--
it
was
developed
in
the
senate.
it
stemmed
from
the
administration's
proposal
that
was
quite
a
bit
more
far
reaching.
that
proposal
required
not
only
annual
updating
of
the
state's
standard
of
need
but
it
also
required
that
all
states
pay
need
in
full
and
there
were
at
that
time
33
states
that
did
not
pay
in
full,
many
of
which
did
not
pay
more
than
50%
of
needs
somewhat
less.
our
position
to
that
statute
in
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
for
the
house
and
senate
committees
centered
primarily
on
the
effect
of
the
full
need
requirements
in
those
states
that
have
long
not
met
the
standard
that
need
that
affect
being
very
large
change
not
on
modest
updating
but
something
much
larger
than
that.
the
administration's
estimate
for
the
total
cost
of
that
bill
though,
it's
important
to
realize,
was
$90
million
for
paying
full
need
of
federal
sharing
that
is
i'm
sorry.
and
$95
million
for
annual
updating
of
standards
that
were
being
paid
in
full
not
the
case
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
senate
finance
committee
modified
that
statute
dropping
the
full
need
requirement
adding
in
its
stead
that
any
maximums
be
proportionately
adjusted.
it
was
passed
by
the
senate
committee
on
a
party
line
vote,
it
was
passed
by
the
senate,
went
to
the
conference
committee
where
they
amended
it
to
drop
just
one
part
of
it
the
annual
reprising
requirement.
the
wording
of
the
language
of
the
provision
remains
the
same
however
from
the
time
that
remerged
from
the
senate
finance
committee
to
the
time
it
was
signed
by
the
president
on
january
the
2nd,
1968.
both
committees
reported
the
bill
out,
i'm
sorry,
the
conference
committee
and
the
senate
finance
committee
reported
bill
out
under
a
heading
increasing
income
of
recipients.
the
bill
was
considered
along
side
a
companion
proposal
to
require
the
states
to
increase
payments
in
the
adult
programs
by
$7.00
and
average
increase
of
$7.50.
and
the
method
chosen
for
that
increase
was
the
adjustment
of
need
standards
and
maximums.
it
is
in
short
we
think
this
history
make
several
things
clear.
one,
the
402
(a)
(23)
is
a
self-evident
departure
from
tradition
in
so
far
as
it
requires
a
modest
adjustment
to
state
need
standards
and
levels
of
payments
in
afdc,
self-evident
and
quite
obvious
to
the
specialist
committees
dealing
with
social
security
legislation
and
certainly
obvious
to
any
congressman
who
took
the
time
to
look
at
it.
two,
the
evolution
of
the
bill
makes
clear
that
it
was
a
compromise,
it
was
not
to
establish
the
floor
of
income
in
every
state
that
would
be
approached
adequacy
as
the
administration
had
originally
urged.
nothing
of
the
kind,
it
rather
was
to
see
that
each
state
paid
at
least
of
what
it
was
then
paying
which
was
renowned
for
all
states
to
be
inadequate
and
to
make
one
adjustment
to
keep
phase
with
living
costs.
it
should
be
added
in
the
administration,
reported
to
the
committees
that
most
states
had
updated
in
1966
or
1967.
there
was
no
great
impact
expected
from
the
required
updating
by
july
1,
1969,
particularly
one
state
maximum
were
accepted.
we
think
this
legislative
history
also
makes
clear,
the
companion
proposal
makes
clear
that
congress
appreciate
the
effect
of
adjusting
this
mechanisms.
the
language
chosen,
the
comprehensive
term
used
to
describe
the
state
needs
standard
plus
the
fact
that
goes
on
to
require
adjustment
to
maximums
leaves
little
room
for
nullification
or
evasion.
and
finally,
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
made
this
a
planned
condition
for
continued
participation
in
afdc
and
gave
the
states
a
one
year
and
a
half
to
make
the
required
adjustments
i
think
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
to
compel
the
states
to
do
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
oh,
i
think
a
state
in
applying
conditions
in
the
afdc
title
mr.
justice
brennan
certainly
contemplate
that
the
state
may
or
may
not
participate
in
the
program.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
brennan,
well
this
is
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
supremacy
clause,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
controlling
only
to
the
extent
if
the
state
participates
in
the
federal
program
receives
and
uses
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
most
certainly
so
it
is
we
aren't
seeking
to
enforce
one
of
the
plan
conditions
that
congress
has
imposed
in
the
received
of
federal
moneys.
just
as
the
alternative
ground
in
king
against
smith
was
the
enforcement
of
the
another
planned
condition,
condition
number
10-a
shall
be
furnished
to
all
eligible
individuals
was
enforced
by
the
petitioners,
was
invoked
by
the
petitioners
in
that
case
to
support
their
claim
that
alabama's
substitute
for
the
rule
was
invalid.
this
court
said
that
alabama
had
breached
its
federally
imposed
obligation
and
that
any
state
law
or
regulation
in
conflict
with
the
social
security
act
in
a
state
that's
participating
of
course,
is
to
that
extent
invalid.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
that
congress
has
given
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
the
power
to
terminate
federal
funds
upon
finding
a
conflict
between
a
state
plan
requirement
and
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
there's
no
administrative
procedure
or
proceeding
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
this
power
in
hew
which
it
may
exercise.
it
has
in
fact
not
exercised
it
not
only
here
but
in
any
other
case
that
we
know
of
except
for
two
since
the
act
was
passed
the
power
being
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
no
different
than
any
other
the
act
contemplates
or
when
a
state
makes
a
change
in
its
amtc.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
well,
it's
not
scheduled
detour
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'll
explain
what
did
happened.
the
state
made
a
change,
they
have
to
submit
that
to
hew.
for
some
reasons,
state
has
permitted
to
implement
it
prior
to
hew's
approval
and
federal
funds
continued
to
flow
and
in
this
particular
case
and
then
a
series
of
discussions
when
negotiations
take
place
between
the
state
and
hew
over
the
change
if
it
raises
questions.
this
provision
was
deemed
to
raise
question
in
hew
and
somewhat
uncharacteristically
swift
fashion
replied
to
new
york
that
section
131
(a),
the
statute
which
reduces
grants
raised
the
question
of
conformity
under
the
social
security
act
would
you
provide
us
with
information.
that
was
in
april,
new
york
provided
the
regulations
and
a
brief
description
of
what
the
statute
does
in
june
and
nothing
further
has
been
heard
between
hew
and
state
of
new
york
except
for
an
event
we
just
learned
recently
that
took
place
on
november
10
in
which
hew
wrote
new
york
a
letter
questioning
some
other
aspect
of
131
(a)
on
the
grounds
of
state
wide
uniformity
under
social
security
act.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan
it's
our
view
that
the
delegation
to
hew
with
the
power
to
cut
off
federal
funds
does
not
preclude
the
remedy
that
this
court
upheld
in
king
against
smith.
that
remedy
being
a
recipient
most
affected
by
state
plan
changes
in
afdc
and
the
other
programs.
may
i
ask
--
it
may
invoke
the
federal
laws
so
long
as
the
state
is
participating
and
a
court
has
power
to
adjudicate
that
controversy.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
between
this
case
and
king
v.
smith,
in
king
v.
smith
hew
had
the
neither
approved
nor
disapproved.
it
had
a
long
history
of
negotiation.
we
have
a
somewhat
shorter
history
of
negotiation
here
but
given
the
nature
of
the
interest
involved
and
also
the
fact
that
hew's
participation
or
expertise
be
at
being
relevant
is
available
to
this
court
or
the
court
below.
indeed
hew
has
very
explicitly
expressed
its
views
in
this
case
and
those
were
before
the
district
court
and
its
brief
from
another
case
and
deregulation.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
all
right,
it
doesn't
and
the
hew
was
invited
to
participate
in
this
case
amicus
at
the
beginning.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
one
of
the
critical
issues
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
that's
quite
often
the
case
mr.
justice
white,
it
didn't
really
advice
the
court,
for
example
it
did
not
advice
the
court
or
anyone
else
in
king
against
smith
exactly
what
its
position
on
substitute
for
the
rules
were.
it
has
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
it
had
--
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
certainly
the
meandering
or
long
protracted
serious
in
negotiations
or
very
indefinite
negotiations
certainly
is
a
characteristic
of
that
process.
it's
not
really
an
adversary
process.
recipients
are
not
the
parties
to
it,
the
states
are
not
really
adversaries
except
in
the
rare
instance
where
hew
invokes
its
power
of
cut
off
and
as
we
said
it's
very
rare
and
he
invokes
that
power.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
not
at
all
mr.
chief
justice,
i
merely
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
no,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
saying
that
that
power
of
hew
to
order
to
cutoff
the
federal
funds
does
not
affect
the
rights
of
recipients
to
come
in
to
federal
court
in
a
due
to
case
validity
under
the
federal
act
of
the
state
law
of
regulation
or
statute
adversity
affects
them
in
this
one
most
adversity
affect
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
we're
just
saying
similarly
to
allen
v.
board
of
elections
--
this
court's
decision
in
allen
v.
board
of
elections.
the
existence
of
administrative
remedy,
the
power
to
cut
off
does
not
preclude
adjudication.
the
united
states
itself
has
said
so
in
regard
to
the
social
security
act.
it
has
come
in
to
court
and
argued
that
hew's
power
to
terminate
is
not
exclusive.
the
courts
have
power
to
adjudicate
validity.
we
think
that
power
is
critical
and
very
important.
we
mention
the
nature
of
these
negotiations
only
to
show
how
critical
and
important
that
power
is
if
the
client
conditions
that
congress
imposes
are
to
be
enforced.
if
in
fact
the
protections,
the
few
protections
that
congress
provides
to
disadvantage
individuals
alleged
or
under
these
programs
are
to
be
effectuated.
we
stressed
the
delay
in
hew
seems
only
to
show
that
a
fact
of
this
court
has
recognize
that
is
that
the
congress
usually
intends
its
laws
to
be
applicable
to
be
enforced.
it
usually
intends
its
policies
to
be
carried
out
if
those
policies
are
to
be
effectuated
in
this
case
and
other
cases
surely
the
answer
given
in
king
against
smith
was
correct.
they
can
come
into
court
and
seek
to
adjudicate.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
i
fought
them
in
this
case.
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
we
believe
in
our
view
is
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute
which
is
a
questionable
obviously
ultimately
for
this
court.
we
think
in
the
line
of
the
policy
of
this
statute
it's
a
question
that
--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
that
certainly
i
just
wanted
to
make--
mr.
lee
a.
albert
i
believed
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
government
did
volunteer
brief
in
this
court
very
recently
and
mentions
a
few
hints
of
something
right
or
wrong,
it
doesn't
want
to
take
the
position
on
the
merits
for
one
reason
or
another.
hew
also
was
issued
to
state
letter,
by
the
way,
which
is
not
a
regulation
of
october
10th
which
rather
studiedly
begs
this
question.
it
says
at
a
minimum
you
must
maintain
your
standards
and
accordance
with
basic
needs
without
providing
us
with
the
definition
of
basic
needs
at
all.
nor
thus,
i
don't
think
fairly
construed
as
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
i
should
like
first
to
return
to
the
arguments
against
this
statute
which
are
said
to
make
our
meaning
inappropriate.
the
basic
argument
is
that
the
statute
is
we
construe
it,
renders
it
to
be
a
measure
working
enormous
change
in
the
federal
state
relationship
on
president
grant
made
programs
at
considerable
compelled
expenditures
and
without
stormy
opposition
in
congress
that
such
a
measure
should
have
resulted
in.
we
think
the
argument
falls
with
each
of
those
premises.
the
cost
of
this
provision
were
before
the
congress,
it
knew
that
the
administration's
original
provision
requiring
a
great
deal
of
more
change
would
cost
overall
$90
million
in
federal
funds
for
full
payment
updated
standards
for
updating
it
full
and
then
paying
those
standards
in
full.
once
that
provision
was
draw
up
to
full
need,
the
cost
had
to
drop
considerably
because
it
was
accepting
maximums
in
33
states;
many
of
which
states
don't
claim
one
in
50%
of
need.
the
administration
had
also
informed
congress
that
most
states
are
updated
recently.
the
cost,
in
other
words,
were
modest
to
stay
the
least
in
a
program
of
$4
billion
federal
expenditures
a
year.
those
cost
range
if
one
takes
the
national
average
of
hew
of
$44
a
recipient
a
year
and
a
10%
cost
of
living
factor,
the
total
cost
would
be
about
$30
million
gross
state
and
federal
expenditures.
this
case
appears
to
be
a
very
big
case
in
terms
of
cost
and
the
source
supports
the
argument
not
because
new
york
has
made
a
cost
of
living
adjustment,
it
estimated
the
cost
of
living
adjustment
and
sound
budget
for
this
year
it
would
$5
million
the
state
share
all
together.
it's
because
what
new
york
has
done
is
cut
grants
and
cut
grants
very
severely.
that
is
not
to
thrust
of
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
passed
this
statute.
any
given
violation
of
a
federal
condition
can
be
costly
if
one
takes
the
condition
in
king
against
smith
and
against
a
state,
for
example
new
york
decides
to
withdraw
aid
to
all
children
whose
parents
have
abandoned
them
and
those
petitioners
invoke
402
(a)
(10).
the
cost
involve
in
that
case
will
be
about
$200
million.
but
that
was
not
the
cost
that
congress
estimated
for
402
(a)
(10)
or
had
in
mind.
although,
it
did
passed
that
provision
to
deal
with
physical
crisis
in
the
states
nor
is
this
provision.
but
my
point
is
the
cost
are
indeed
modest,
two
this
is
not
on
president
and
federal
granted
programs.
our
contention
it
should
be
clear
as
not
the
402
(a)
(23)
compels
the
state
to
appropriate
certain
amount
of
money
of
afdc.
it
rather,
it
poses
a
limit
on
one
mechanism
to
be
use
to
reduce
expenditures
that
mechanism
being
the
reduction
of
grants.
the
medicate
program
passed
for
two
years
before
also
a
federal
grant
made
program
with
similar
matching
50%
the
new
york
and
of
fair
percentage
for
other
states,
imposes
very
similar
requirements
but
rather
more
and
those
were
passed
without
controversy.
that
act
requires
not
only
that
states
may
not
divert
funds
from
the
public
assistance
titles
to
operate
medicate,
it
requires
that
the
states
must
at
a
minimum
provide
a
to
persons
who
would
be
eligible
for
public
assistance
under
the
most
liberal
money-payment
standard
in
the
states
during
the
last
three
years
and
it
also
provides
that
the
state
must
at
a
minimum
that
the
state
must
provide
to
all
eligible
individuals
at
least
five
categories
of
services
in-patient,
out-patient
hospital
physicians
and
the
like.
the
sum
total
of
those
requirements
is
most
and
it
also
requires
the
states
expand
demonstrate
their
expanding
reference
under
medicate.
my
point
is
the
sum
total
of
those
requirements
is
indeed
to
impose
a
limit
on
the
ability
of
the
state
to
participate
and
choose
to
spend
what
it
wishes,
not
a
rigid
limit
but
this
is
not
a
rigid
limit
either.
this
provision
leaves
safe
with
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
not
to
reduce
grants
which
should
be
said,
but
in
other
areas
to
affect
their
afdc
budget
of
public
welfare
expenditures.
states
are
free
within
very
broad
limits
to
determine
eligibility,
financial
responsibility
of
relatives,
implementation
of
the
win
program,
the
work
consented
program,
certainly
the
amount
of
local
financial
participation
and
the
like.
we
think
that
this
court
did
refer
in
king
against
smith
to
the
state
power
to
determine
its
resources
through
setting
of
standards
of
need.
but
that's
an
example
of
flexibility.
there
were
many
other
examples
that
can
be
adduced.
burrow
with
the
departure
in
this
provision
is
done
so
by
reflecting
most
to
the
very
established
pattern
in
afdc,
it
accepts
as
it
has
the
government
has
since
1935,
the
enormous
variations
among
the
several
states
in
resources
and
the
like
and
a
lot
of
this
states
and
accepts
the
states
own
standard
of
need.
it
also
continues
greater
federal
responsibility
for
states
with
lesser
wealth
and
lower
grant
that's
a
pattern
or
a
tradition
in
afdc.
even
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the
provision
should
have
been
controversial,
this
is
really
torrential
out
of
its
legislative
setting
in
1967.
after
all,
it
was
part
of
omnibus
legislative
amendment,
also
part
of
a
compromise
between
the
senate
and
the
house
which
disputed
over
many
provisions.
this
was
one
their
compromises
and
this
setting,
the
absence
of
and
it
was
also
passed
in
under
passed
on
the
floor.
under
rules
are
very
restricted
debate
and
no
amendments
in
the
house
certainly
and
at
the
end
of
the
senate,
no
amendments
also.
in
this
setting
silence
even
by
those
who
should
have
opposed
that
assuming
there
should've
been
such
persons,
it
would
seem
to
me
as
part
of
the
legislative
art
of
reaching
a
compromise
and
accord
on
no
less
than
300
different
provisions
that
were
embodied
in
its
1967
amendments.
we'll
refer
to
now
to
the
new
york
statute
and
whether
what
it
does
is
somehow
consistent
with
the
402
(a)
(23).
in
our
view
the
heart
of
402
(a)
(23)
is
to
guarantee
an
increase
in
income
of
recipients
as
the
committee
said
based
on
cost
of
living
changes.
new
york
has
done
is
decrease
the
income
of
recipients
by
approximately
8
to
12%
depending
on
which
recipient,
i'll
talk
about
the
changes
in
a
moment
and
its
clearly
done
did
this
to
reduce
overall
afdc
expenditures
in
new
york
by
$100
million
out
of
a
total
of
approximately
$900
million.
that's
a
one
out
of
every
$9.00
was
taken
out
of
the
afdc.
how
that
can
be
said
to
comply
with
the
statute,
how
the
adjustment
of
needs
standards,
new
york
does
not
have
maximums,
how
the
adjustment
of
need
standards
can
be
said
which
saved
which
reduces
everybody's
grant
by
$1.00
out
of
$9.00
can
be
said
to
comply
with
the
statute
that
requires
an
adjustment
for
cost
for
a
reprising
for
cost
of
living
changes
obviously
going
up
is
itself
startling
proposition.
our
view
on
mr.
justice
brennan,
your
question
of
streamlining
is
402
(a)
(23)
has
nothing
to
do
with
streamlining,
that
is
not
the
concern
of
the
statute,
its
proponents
or
anyone
else
who
discussed
that
never
talk
about
streamlining.
one
should
have
is
no
federal
statute
or
federal
regulation
that
defines
what
streamlining
is
either.
states
have
like
new
york;
they
have
used
several
methods
of
providing
grants.
one
of
those
methods
is
to
provide
the
grant
as
a
supplement
as
it
does
for
example
for
rent
today
as
it
did
for
articles
of
home
furnishing
and
clothing.
we
don't
think
that
402
(a)
(23)
allows
the
state
to
eliminate
whatever
items
it
now
deems
unnecessary
and
unnecessary
for
reasons
have
nothing
to
do
with
basic
--
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
lee
a.
albert
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
know
of
no
case
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
or
primary
jurisdiction
in
which
the
litigant
being
harmed
by
a
statute
has
no
access
to
that
agency
and
may
not
initiate
any
proceeding
and
may
not
participate
in
any
proceeding
before
it.
we
think
that
that
was
obvious
to
this
court
in
king
against
smith,
in
damico
against
california
and
in
salmon
against
shapiro.
we
don't
think
that
that
requires
a
reexamination;
we
don't
think
it
should
be
--
we
don't
think
the
rule
should
be
any
different
in
this
case.
the
result
of
a
decree
in
this
case
is
not
necessarily
greater
or
lesser
than
any
other
violation
of
the
social
security
act.
after
all,
in
king
against
smith,
alabama
reduced
its
roles
by
25%
through
its
substitute
for
the
rule,
that's
lot
of
people.
true,
it
could
turned
to
its
benefit
levels
that's
a
lot
of
money
involved
in
king
v.
smith,
the
louisiana
sued
the
home
ruins,
similarly
involved
a
great
deal
of
many
people.
there's
no
intrinsic
or
(inaudible)
in
age
distinction
between
benefit
levels
and
scope
with
eligibility
very
much
depends
on
the
case.
this
court
is
not
called
upon
to
decide
whether
new
york
has
eliminated
basic
items
or
non-basic
items.
section
402
(a)
(23)
does
talk
after
all
of
the
items
used
to
determine
need.
in
the
context
of
this
case
however
find
questions
about
an
item
a
need
no
longer
existing,
it
does
not
arise
or
find
questions
that
the
state
substituting
oil
for
coal
as
a
way
of
fulfilling
your
need
for
fuel.
those
kinds
of
questions
are
not
before
this
court.
as
the
findings
below
amply
support
it
may
clear,
this
is
an
overall
streamlining
so
to
speak
to
reduce
welfare
afdc
expenditures
for
one
year
in
new
york
by
$100
million
as
the
hew
makes
clear
for
july
1969.
its
average
went
from
$71.00
per
person
to
$62.00
per
person.
i
--
there's
something
more
going
on
there
than
so
called
streamlining.
moreover,
if
one
looks
to
the
two
primary
ways
new
york
accomplished
this,
it
took
to
age
differentiated
schedules
giving
a
great
deal
more
for
older
children
and
did
a
way
with
the
differentials
for
older
children
not
because
they
don't
have
greater
requirements
for
food
or
social
or
educational
necessities,
but
because
it
wanted
to
save
money.
it
justifies
that
at
some
sort
of
convenience
in
administration
by
saying
“we'd
have
to
change
it
every
two
years
otherwise.”
new
recertifies
individuals
every
three
months
and
makes
countless
adjustments
to
the
grant
every
month
for
every
dollar
of
resource
or
income
received
on
any
individual.
how
new
york
is
saying
“let's
look
at
two
figures
in
a
chart
and
to
have
to
make
an
adjustment
and
adc
families
granting
to
every
two
years.”
somehow,
its
administrative
inefficiency
boggles
the
imagination.
the
large
other
item
eliminated
are
supplementary
grants
for
clothing
and
home
furnishings.
those
were
administered
in
new
york
as
a
flat
grant
not
a
special
grant.
no
one
applied
for
it.
they
got
a
check
in
the
mail
every
quarter
of
$25.00
per
person.
there's
no
administrative
efficiency
in
eliminating
that
whatsoever,
there's
cost
saving
and
nothing
more.
thank
you.
