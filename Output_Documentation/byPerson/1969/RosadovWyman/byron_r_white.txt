justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
hew
hasn't
addressed
itself
to
one
or
two
of
the
critical
issues,
doesn't
report
to
be
answering
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
says
in
its
brief
in
this
court
that
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
telling
us
whether
it's
just
the
streamlining
of
the
state
standard
or
on
the
other
hand
it's
forbidden
as
an
impressible
reduction
in
the
confidence
standards.
that's
the
critical
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
on
that
and
apparently
it
hasn't
devised
anyone
on
that
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
mr.
albert,
we'll
have
to--that
issue
that
i
have
referred
to
a
moment
ago
certainly
has
to
be
decided
in
this
case
if
we
get
to
the
merits.
all
we
have
to
be
deciding
it
without
any
views
of
those
who
might
know
more
about
the
updating
some
standard
in
need
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
may
be
so,
but
then
you
have
to
make
it
to
state
statute
against,
and
the
argument
is
that
the
state
statute
is
consistent.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
have
to
decide
that
issue
wouldn't
we,
without
any
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
--
without
the
hew
or
the
government
having
stated
what
if
thought
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
wasn't
a
decision
of
king
against
smith,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
in
king
against
smith
specifically
said
that
there
was
a
correspondence
going
on
and
then
said
it
on
page
326,
“additional
correspondent
ensued
with
hew
never
approved
deregulation.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
there
has
been
correspondence
going
on
between
new
york
departments.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
was
--
did
mr.
albert
practically
describe
what's
happened
so
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
assume
hew
decided
that
what
the
new
york
has
done
is
quite
consistent
with
that
section
43
or
whatever
it
is.
would
they
say
so
or
would
they
just
not
or
they
just
be
quiet.
justice
byron
r.
white
they'll
write
you
a
letter
to
say
we
approve
it
or
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
have
and
if
they
did
say,
do
they
usually
just
say
yes
if
they
say,
yes,
and
yes
because
and
say
why
they
think
its
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
it
has
in
new
york
in
one
of
those
states
that
all
in
said
that
one
point
to
sets
of
standards
in
need
and
that's
the
actual
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
still
is,
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
when
you
set
a
standard
of
need,
you
purport
to
fulfill
it
in
full?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
131
was
then
a
change
in
the
standard
of
need
as
well
as
the
actual
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
change
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
major
purpose
on
131
(a)?
was
it
to
switch
the
basis
for
determining
welfare
payments
from
the
individual
case
to
general
categories?
was
that
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it's
streamlining,
but
what
does
streamlining
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short,
you
don't
determine
individual
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
simplifies
the
administration?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
mr.
weinberg,
new
york's
position
is
that
it
did
the
one-shot
updating
or
did
not
have
to
was
already
updated,
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
--
in
response
to
the
67
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
it,
under
131
(a),
did
you
have
to
do
the
updating
anyway
under
your
own
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
you
did,
in
compliance
with
your
own
state
law
and
not
necessarily
in
compliance
with
the
new
federal
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
necessary
mr.
weinberg?
why
would
to
be
more
than
the
declaratory
judgement
and
then
it
will
be
up
for
hew
to
catch
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
declaratory
--
if
we
were
to
say
there
was
a
conflict,
would
we
declare
more
than
that?
we
wouldn't
order
the
new
york
legislature
to
make
good
money.
i
would
suppose
this
would
mean
hew
then
ether
would
have
to
catch
up
or
because
instead
of
cutting
you
off
that
would
bring
your
legislature
around
increasing,
providing
the
money,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
we
ask
to
order
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
maybe
asking
for
it
but
does
it
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
say
“i
should
think
you
can
argue
that
if
they're
right
that
they're
entitled
on
a
relief
whatever?”
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
still
give
them
declaratory
judgement
i
suppose
within
the
framework
of
what
they're
asking
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suggest
control
the
ball
in
the
hew
alley,
that's
where
it
belongs
anyway
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
hew
had
approved,
actually
approved
your
present
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
then
you
were
standing
here,
let's
assume
right
now
hew
had
approved
this.
we
would
have
to
decide
this
case,
wouldn't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
would
like
to
said
that,
but
assumed
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
got
some
other
type
of
questions
on
some
other
points
on
that
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
the
hew
hasn't
addressed
itself

one
