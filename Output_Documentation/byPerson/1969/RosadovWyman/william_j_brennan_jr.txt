justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
compelled
or
the
state
would
not
be
pleading
simply
to
ignore
the
federal
provision
and
except
for
nothing
except
for
the
laws
of
the
federal
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
probably
about
this
case
mr.
albert
and
i
don't
quite
understand
that
the
only
sanction
is
simply
discontinuance
in
federal
system.
how
do
plaintiffs
in
here
have
any
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
means
the
federal
statute,
i
gather
would
have
to
be
controlling
in
front
of
the
states,
disregarding
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
a
state
decides
and
says,
“no,
well
we
want
no
part
of
the
federal
system
any
longer.”
and
votes
this
constant
argument
and
the
other
type
charge
will
close
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
the
ultimate
source
in
the
problem
here
is
for
provision
that
permits
this
kind
of
conflict
of
either
one
to
be
resolved
in
the
first
instance?
i've
forgotten
this
conference
the
hearing
of
something
before
hew?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
their
procedure
or
an
administered
procedure
for
resolving
this
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
point
we
heard
something
of
a
contemplated
conference
or
hearing
or
something
on
this
very
question
that
to
have
been
scheduled
on
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
anything
scheduled
between
hew
and
the
state
officials
in
this
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
issue
right
for
judicial
decision
until
that
procedure
is
been
completed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
special
with
all
the
special
grants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
these
things
were
eliminated
is
that
in
the
computation
of
the
gross
payment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather
basically
on
the
question
of
a
conflict
through
the
federal
regulation
you'd
say
that
it's
been
no
change
in
the
standard
of
need
period
because
these
special
grants
were
an
addition
to
the
chance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
standard
need.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
--
why
is
it
you
suppose
hew
tells
us
their
not
going
to
advise
us
whether
they
think
you're
right
or
wrong
about
that
proposition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder
how
much
looking
into
it
takes
to
discover
that
in
fact
the
special
services
are
still
available
in
the
different
form,
how
much
times
does
that
take?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
some
of
these
correspondents
between
you
and
hew
touch
the
subject
a
notice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
noted
november
10
is
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
those
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
which
appendix
is
your

justice
william

oh,
yes.
