excuse
me,
can
i
interrupt
you
on
your
grammatical
demonstration.
the
first
time
the
phrase
is
used,
early
on,
"the
tribe
and
its
members
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
special
services
from
the
united
states
for
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians.
"
what
do
you
think
the
antecedent
of
the
first
"their"
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
"their"
referred
to
members
of
the
tribe,
why
couldn't
later
"theirs"
and
"thems"
also
refer
to
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
you're
right
as
a
matter
of
overall...
in
comparing
it
with
another
statute.
it
seems
to
me,
if
we
just
look
at
this
language,
it's
really
ambiguous.
you
could
read
to
them,
either
to
refer
to
the
members
of
the
tribe
board
or
both
the
tribe--
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record,
the
1763
claim
being
discussed
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
identify
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
those
contemporaneous
papers
that
indicates
that
what
they
were
referring
to
was
the
17683
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
of
the
tribe
in
march
of
<fifty-eight>
[=
'58]?
justice
john
paul
stevens
while
you
are
interrupted,
for
just
a
second--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
record
has
the
list
of
the
61
people,
members
of
the
tribe
who
voted,
i
guess
it
was
47
to
17
in
favor
of
this
transaction,
and
you
indicated
that
1763
treaty
claim
and
they
were
conscious
of
expressly
intended
to
preserve
that
at
that
time.
why
do
you
suppose
nobody
asserted
the
claim
any
time,
shortly
after
the
transaction
took
place,
if
they
were
aware
of
it
at
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
them
was
entitled
to
about
2,000
acres
of
pretty
valuable
land.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
even
granting
all
that,
assuming
that
to
be
true,
it's
still
a
little
tribal
discussion
and
a
critical
part
of
their
negotiations,
it
just
puzzles
me
that
they
would
say,
well,
okay,
we've,
got
this
claim.
let's
put
it
back
on
the
back
burner
and
let
it
sit,
at
that
time.
it's
such
a
terribly
valuable
claim.
could
it
be
they
didn't
have
legal
advice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
seems
puzzling
to
me
that
when
a
congressman
is
dealing
with
them
about
a
statute
they
wouldn't
say,
by
the
way,
we
would
like
this
144,000
acre
transaction
cleaned
up
at
the
same
time.
that's
what
puzzles
me.
even
they
don't
have
a
lawyer,
they're
talking
to
people
who
are
interested
in
their
affairs
and
i
just
find
it
hard
to
understand.
