mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
eastern
indian
land
claim
case,
under
the
commonly
known
or
called
statute,
the
non-intercourse
act,
the
first
part
of
which
was
1790
and
there
were
sections
or
additions
thereafter
from
time
to
time.
the
land
here
in
question
consists
of
approximately
144,000
acres
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
embodying
the
city
of
rock
hill,
the
town
of
fort
mill
and
a
number
of
other
smaller
communities
in
lancaster
and
york
counties
and
perhaps
even
part
of
chester
county.
the
case
arises
despite
the
fact
that
this
claim
is
made
in
the
face
of
a
termination
act,
so-called,
catawba
termination
act
of
1959.
it
seems
important
that
in
order
to
interpret
that
act
as
it
is
applicable
or
not
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
we
should
address
perhaps
the
congressional
policy
that
prevailed
in
the
late
1950's
and
'60s,
the
late
1950's
and
early
1960's
with
respect
to
the
status
of
indians
and
indian
tribes
and
the
larger
society
in
this
country.
during
those
period
of
years,
sometimes
referred
as
the
termination
period,
it
was
the
express
policy
of
the
congress
to
eliminate
the
indian
reservations,
to
eliminate
the
difference
between
indians,
tribal
indians
and
indian
tribes
in
the
larger
society,
and
that
congress
directed
effective
steps
to
be
sure
that
that
elimination
ultimately
was
culminated.
pursuant
to
that
policy
the
house
of
representatives
directed
that
a
report
after
investigation
be
made
with
respect
to
what
tribes
could
be
considered
to
be
appropriate
for
assimilation
in
the
larger
society.
the
catawba
indians,
who
are
the
respondents
in
this
case,
were
early
on
recognized
as
a
group
that
was
so
advanced
that
they
could
safely
be
assimilated
into
the
larger
society.
pursuant
thereto,
the
congress
enacted
the
so-called
catawba
termination
act
as
one
of
12
termination
acts
enacted
by
congress
during
this
period
of
time.
the
specific
legislative
history
is
also
important
to
the
construction
to
be
applied
to
the
termination
act
as
it
pertains
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
addition
to
being
designated
as
ready
for
assimilation,
the
catawbas
themselves
had
requested
that
they
be
relieved
from
the
burden
of
federal
supervision
as
they
then
viewed
it,
and
participated
by
resolution
and
otherwise
in
fostering
legislation
that
they
felt
was
oppressive
to
them
under
the
circumstances.
ultimately
the
congressmen
from
that
area,
congressmen
temple,
introduced
an
act
which
became
ultimately
the
termination
act
for
the
catawbas,
but
only
after
reviewing
it
with
the
tribe,
having
the
tribe
approve
the
concept
of
terminating
the
federal
relationship
with
their
group,
and
ultimately
after
the
act
was
passed
by
the
congress,
an
explanation
was
sent
to
the
catawbas,
and
that
explanation
made
it
very
clear
that
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
catawbas
was
at
an
end.
perhaps
it
might
be
worth
our
while
to
look
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
137.
this
is
an
explanation
that
was
sent
to
the
catawba
indians,
and
i
suggest
it
contains
not
only
the
intent
behind
the
statute
but
also
underlines
the
catawba
indians'
understanding
of
what
was
happening.
in
the
middle
of
page
137,
this
explanation
sent
to
the
catawbas
states,
section
5
revokes
the
tribal
constitution,
and
that
in
fact
did
happen
in
1962,
which
means
that
the
tribe
will
no
longer
exist
as
a
federally
recognized
organization.
in
addition,
just
as
the
tribe
no
longer
will
be
a
legal
entity,
it
shall
be
governed
by
federal
laws
which
refer
to
tribes
so
the
individual
members
will
no
longer
be
subject
to
laws
which
apply
only
to
indians.
nothing
in
the
act
prohibits
those
interested
in
organizing
under
state
law
to
carry
on
any
of
the
non-governmental
activities
of
the
group.
i
submit
it
would
be
difficult
to
express
in
the
english
language
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
in
the
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
catawbas
that
their
relationship
with
the
federal
government
was
totally
and
completely
terminated
without
question.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
in
oneida
2,
this
court
recently
discussed
an
underlying
common
law.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
answer
is
as
follows.
there
indeed
is
recognized
a
common
law
with
respect
to
limitations
on
transfers
of
aboriginal
titles
by
indians.
it's
the
law
of
the
united
states,
incidentally.
that
is
embodied
in
the
non-intercourse
acts,
so
it's
clear
from
a
point
of
view
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
that
the
non-intercourse
acts
embody
now
the
common
law
as
it
relates
to
these
indians,
no
longer
shall
be
applicable
because
the
statute
embodying
that
common
law
is
ruled
out
of
having
any
application.
and,
may
i
read
to
you
briefly
what
some
of
the
congressmen
thought
about
what
they
were
doing
at
this
time.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
yes,
in
this
case,
because
the
statute
that
we're
interested
in
embodies
and
is
a
codification
of
the
common
law,
so
to
in
effect
repeal
that
statute,
you
make
that
common
law,
what's
embodied
in
that
statute,
non-applicable
and
clearly
congress
had
that
in
mind.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
don't
think
it
exists
separate
and
apart.
my
point
of
view
is
that
it
embodies
and
incorporates
and
codifies
the
common
law.
so,
to
say
that
the
non-intercourse
act,
or
acts
as
the
case
may
be,
are
non-applicable,
you
have
said
in
substance
that
the
common
law,
even,
as
it
might
otherwise
have
applied,
is
also
non-appropriate
for
this
purpose,
and
clearly
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
for
example,
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
we
quote
briefly
from
the
statement
made
by
senator
watkins,
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
indian
affairs,
relating
to
the
termination
policy
of
the
congress.
"we
do
not
want
the
government
still
in
the
indian
business
by
any
implication
whatsoever.
"
"if
we
have
severed
the
cord
which
binds
us
to
the
indians,
or
the
indians
to
us,
we
want
it
completely
severed
and
not
just
a
little
strand
left.
"
more
briefly,
senator
anderson
said,
"termination
is
a
single
term.
"
"i'm
sure
termination
means
termination
and
not
continuance.
"
senator
church
finally
says,
"an
end
is
an
end
is
an
end.
"
there
can
be
no
doubt,
justice
o'connor,
in
my
view
that
congress
intended
to
sever
all
relations,
common-law,
statutory,
and
otherwise,
by
this
termination
act
as
far
as
the
federal
government
and
the
catawbas
was
concerned.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
early
in
the
1900's,
representatives
of
the
catawbas
called
upon
representatives
of
the
bia,
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
and
the
record
i
think
is
only
fairly
interpreted
to
mean
they
said,
what
about
our
rights
under
the
non-intercourse
act.
they
revised...
they
have
no
such
rights.
you
are
not
a
federally
recognized
tribe.
you
are
in
fact
state
tribe.
the
federal
government
has
no
relationship
with
you
whatsoever.
that
was
confirmed
by
an
indian
agent
to
the
catawbas
within
this
same
period,
early
in
the
1900's.
for
75
years
thereafter
nothing
further
was
done
by
the
catawbas
with
respect
to
their
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
any
claim.
you
have
to
understand
that
prior
to
1975,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
when
the
bassamaquoddy
case
was
decided,
no
one
understood
that
non-recognized
tribes
had
a
federal
relationship
for
the
purpose
of
the
non-intercourse
act.
that
only
came...
that
understanding
came
in
1975.
these
indians
were
looked
upon
as
state
indians,
and
the
catawbas
were
looked
upon
as
state
tribes,
and
when
they
made
inquiry
about
it,
that
was
confirmed
to
them
and
apparently
they
accepted
it
because
nothing
was
done
for
virtually
75
years.
a
great
deal--
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
the
reference
you
are
now
making
is
a
reference
to
the
discussions
previous
to
the
memorandum
of
understanding
of
1943,
<forty-three
odd>
[=
43-odd]
years
later.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
also
again
in
1958.
the
catawbas
have
continuously
since
1840,
when
south
carolina
purchased
their
interests
pursuant
to
the
treaty
of
nations,
contended
that
south
carolina
had
breached
their
agreement
and
that
they
had
a
claim
against
south
carolina.
what
seems
to
us
to
be
very
clear
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
interpreted
a
claim
against
south
carolina
as
being
a
non-intercourse
claim.
of
course,
it
is
not
so
described.
the
claim
against
south
carolina
is
not
the
way
you
describe
a
non-intercourse
claim.
a
non-intercourse
claim
is
like
this
one,
against
27,000-odd
people.
it
is
clear
in
our
view
that
what
is
being
referred
to
by
the
indians
was
a
claim
that
they
had
persisted
in,
that
south
carolina
did
not
carry
out
its
obligations
under
the
1840
treaty
or
when
they
acquired
the
catawba
lands.
and
may
it
also
be
said
that
nothing
has
ever
been
done
with
respect
to
that
claim
by
the
catawbas
even
until
today.
carolina,
of
course,
south
carolina,
feels
that
they
did
not
breach
the
agreement,
and
in
fact
over
the
years
has
done
a
great
deal
for
the
catawba
indians.
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
respondents
that,
well,
the
claim
against
south
carolina
is
sort
of
a
shorthand
way
of
contending
that
there
is
a
claim
under
the
non-intercourse
act,
and
they
cite
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
exhibit
14.
a
careful
reading
of
that
does
not
support
the
suggestion,
and
furthermore
it
is
not
likely
that
the
catawabs
had
in
mind
a
non-intercourse
claim
even
as
late
as
1943
because
neither
the
indians
nor
the
congress
nor
the
department
of
interior
understood
that
a
non-recognized
tribe
had
any
federal
relationship
that
would
justify
a
claim
under
the
federal
non-intercourse
act
as
appropriate.
that
did
not
come
until
later,
and
i
guess
what
this
case
is
all
about
is,
try
to
transport
the
law
as
it
developed
in
1975
in
bassamaquoddy
back
into
the
intentions
of
the
congress,
the
understandings
of
the
tribe,
and
south
carolina.
it
simply
does
not
wash.
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is,
i
think,
important
in
this
case,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
termination
that
congress
in
plain
english
terminated
whatever
relationship
might
exist
between
the
federal
government
and
between
the
tribe,
or
the
group.
in
1943
there
had
been
a
memorandum
of
understanding
entered
into
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
federal
farm
agency,
south
carolina
and
the
catawbas.
it
was
a
contract.
it
was
not
legislatively
initiated,
and
it
provided
for
certain
welfare
or
certain
payments
to
be
made
to
assist
the
catawbas.
part
of
that
involved,
however,
the
purchase
of
$75,000
worth
of
land,
some
3,400
acres
by
the
state
of
south
carolina,
which
was
then
given
to
the
secretary
of
interior
to
hold
in
trust
for
the
catawbas.
the
respondents,
of
course,
argue,
well,
this
whole
case
is
nothing
more
than
an
effort
to
terminate
that
memorandum
of
understanding
which
was
not
legislatively
enacted
and
did
not
require
legislation
to
terminate.
but
it
did
have
the
appearance,
at
least,
of
a
fiduciary
or
trust
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
the
catawbas
because
the
secretary
held
3,400
acres
in
trust
for
them.
so,
one
understands
under
the
circumstances
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
this
case
was
to
be
sure
that
all
ratifications
of
that
fact
are
eliminated
by
the
termination
act.
no
reference
is
made
in
the
termination
act
to
the
memorandum
of
understanding
which
would
seem,
it's
only
purpose
clearly
would
have
been
referenced
in
the
act,
and
the
language
did
not
support
it
because
the
language
says,
all
statutes.
the
memorandum
of
understanding
was
not
even
a
statute.
it
did
not
require
a
statute
to
terminate
it.
but
the
termination
act
did
terminate
that
memorandum
of
understanding
and
any
other
relationships
which
may
be
implied
from
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
held
land
for
the
catawbas
in
trust.
if
we
look
at
the
language
itself,
and
i
think
that
with
all
due
respect
the
court
of
appeals
has
violated
probably
some
fairly
well
understood
rules
of
grammar
in
their
interpretation
of
the
language
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
new
brief,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
examine
in
some
detail,
the
first
sentence
says
the
constitution
of
the
tribe,
adopted
pursuant
to
the
act
of
june
18,
1934,
as
amended,
shall
be
revoked
by
the
secretary.
the
reference
to
1934
is
the
circumstances
of
the
memorandum
of
understanding.
part
of
that
contract
was
that
the
tribe
would
have
a
constitution,
and
one
was
adopted
pursuant
to
that.
thereafter,
the
tribe
and
its
members
shall
not
be
entitled
to
any
of
the
special
services
performed
by
the
united
states
for
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians.
this
is
obviously
a
compound
sentence,
the
subject
of
which
is,
the
tribe
and
its
members.
however,
the
court
below
said,
well,
the
next
clause
says,
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
that
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
be
inapplicable
to
them,
and
they
said,
well,
"them"
means
indians.
it
would
seem
to
us
clear
that
simple
grammar
would
require
"them"
to
refer
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
sentence.
but
even
more
importantly,
if
you
adopt
the
language
as
the
respondents
argued
to
the
court,
you
get
a
nonsense
result,
because
then
if
that's
to
be
an
independent
sentence,
it
says,
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
that
affect
indians
because
of
their
status
as
indians
shall
be
inapplicable
to
them,
the
indians.
obviously,
that
proves
too
much.
it
means
all
statutes
that
relate
to
indians
no
longer
have
any
bearing.
it
cannot
mean
that.
it
clearly
means
that
as
to
this
tribe
and
its
members,
all
the
statutes
no
longer
have...
will
be
applicable.
then
they
say,
to
make
it
clear
that
the
laws
of
the
several
states
shall
apply
to
them,
again
the
tribe
and
its
members,
in
the
same
manner
they
apply
to
other
persons
or
citizens
within
their
jurisdiction.
nothing
in
the
act
shall
affect
the
status
of
persons
as
citizens
of
the
united
states.
if
there
is
any
question...
but
then
an
attempt
in
congress
to
use
a
broad,
sweeping
legislative
act
to
eliminate
any
vestige
of
trustrelationship
or
federal
responsibility
for
the
catawbas,
it
seems
to
me
the
adoption
in
this
last
sentence
would
prove
the
point.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
the
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
--well,
because
"indians"
and
"tribe"
are
used
interchangeably
in
legislation
such
as
this,
and
have
been
for
many
years
in
respect
to
other
statutes.
"indians"
and
"tribes",
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing.
but,
to
take
the
second
clause
out
and
say,
all
indians
no
longer
have
the
benefit
of
federal
regulation
in
substance,
as
i
say,
proves
far
too
much.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
well,
all
i
can
say
is,
even
the
non-intercourse
act
uses
indians
and
tribes
as
being
co-terminous,
meaning
the
same
thing.
but
quite
aside
from
that,
the
second
clause
does
not...
and
the
second
one
is
what
the
court
of
appeals,
fourth
circuit,
focused
upon,
does
not
do
what
that
court
said
it
did.
there
is
no
ambiguity
that
you
can
resolve
in
favor
of
the
indians,
and
the
ambiguity
renders
it
meaningless,
and
it
was
so
broad,
or
viewed
by
congress
as
being
so
broad
that
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
citizenship
was
saved
and
that's
why
that
last
sentence
was
in
there.
i
would
like
to
examine
this
case
in
the
light
of
oneida
2,
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
our
view,
of
course,
that
the
statute
at
the
least
referred
to
state
law
for
resolution
of
any
dispute
that
might
arise.
lower
courts
in
non-intercourse
act
cases
have
said,
although
this
court
has
never
been
asked
to,
rule,
that
failure
on
the
part
of
indians
to
establish
their
tribal
existence
under
federal
law
prevents
their
satisfying
the
prerequisites
of
a
prima
facie
case.
if
that
were
applied
by
this
court
in
this
case,
the
case
would
thus
be
over.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
be
reinstated,
and
judgment
for
summary
judgment
would
be
reinstated.
however,
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
go
that
far.
under
oneida
2,
it
was
made
clear
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
made
applicable
it
will
be
applicable
in
this
case.
the
law
apparently,
as
analyzed
in
oneida
2,
was
to
the
effect
that
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
of
law
that
has
no
statute
of
limitations,
you
reference,
then,
the
appropriate
state
statutes,
unless
of
course
federal
policy
indicates
otherwise.
in
this
case
the
termination
act
performs
as
i
view
it,
the
function
of
disclosing
or
doing
away
with
any
federal
policy
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
referencing
the
state
statute
of
limitations
where
the
federal
statute...
there
is
no
federal
statute
of
limitations.
so
that,
carrying
oneida
2
to
the
next
step,
as
i
think
this
case
does,
produces
the
opposite
result.
congress
clearly
intended
to
remove
any
federal
policy
as
it
relates
to
the
catawbas
from
any
federal
significance.
therefore,
there
is
nothing
that
stands
in
the
way
of
applying
the
usual
rule
to
find
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
not
only
as
a
matter
of
analysis
but
of
course,
the
termination
act
itself
could
be
so
read
to
reference
the
state
statutes.
now,
under
the
state
statute,
it's
easy
to
get
lost
unless
you
remember
which
part
you
are
thinking
about.
they
have
a
statute
of
limitations
and
they
have
a
provision
for
adverse
possession.
a
plaintiff,
in
this
case
the
respondent,
has
to
show
possession
or
record
title
within
ten
years
of
bringing
the
action,
namely,
this
action.
mr.
james
d.
st.
clair
i
don't
believe
they
did,
to
this
extent
in
any
event.
but
if,
by
definition,
this
plaintiff
who
seeks
trespass
damages
cannot
establish
possession
or
record
title
within
ten
years
of
commencement
of
this
action,
therefore
this
plaintiff
cannot
prevail
under
state
law
without
even
a
approaching
the
question
of
adverse
possession.
it's
simply
not
appropriate
or
applicable.
the
respondents
try
to
mix
those
two
up,
and
it's
really
quite
simple,
and
accordingly,
then,
under
the
law
of
south
carolina,
this
action
cannot
prevail
because
it's
barred.
the
statute
began
to
run
in
1962
when
the
constitution
was
revoked.
it
expired
in
1972.
this
action
was
brought
in
1980.
finally,
then,
a
few
moments
with
menominee.
great
stress
is
laid
on
menominee
by
the
respondents.
we
thing
menominee
is
inappropriate
in
this
case.
the
specific
facts,
i
think,
easily
differentiate
the
two
cases.
the
termination
act
for
the
menominee
was
in
the
context
of
a
public
law
280
issue
before
the
same
congress,
and
this
court
held
that
public
law
280
should
be
read
together
with
the
termination
act
under
menominee.
in
menominee
there
was
a
treaty
with
the
united
states
that
remained
in
full
force
and
effect
at
the
time
of
the
termination
act.
public
law
280
preserved
that
treaty.
justice
douglas
in
menominee
said,
well,
reading
those
two
together
the
termination
act
should
not
be
construed
as
terminating
the
united
states
treaty
for
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
and
furthermore
the
termination
act
only
references
statutes.
we
have
no
treaty
with
the
united
states
in
this
case.
we
have
no
treaty
outstanding
in
full
force
and
effect.
we
have
no
public
law
280
statute
to
be
read
in
materia
with
the
statute,
and
i
suggest
that
under
these
circumstances
that
the
menominees
should
be
limited
as
the
courts
have
decided
cases
arising
under
the
same
circumstances,
as
being
limited
to
its
facts.
the
case
before
this
court
now
is
a
clear
expression
of
a
congressional
intent
in
a
period
of
enactment
of
terminating
all
vestiges
of
federal
responsibility
for
and
trust
relationship
between
the
catawbas
and
the
united
states,
and
that
terminated
the
rights
if
the
catawbas
had
any
under
the
non-intercourse
act
and
even
then
under
the
common
law,
the
intent
of
congress
being
clear
and
the
language
of
the
statue
being
clear.
