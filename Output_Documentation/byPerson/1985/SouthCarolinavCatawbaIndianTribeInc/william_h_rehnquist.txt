justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
st.
clair,
judge
butzner
in
his
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
something
that
happened,
i
guess
before
the
enactment
of
the
act
itself,
where
he
says
an
indian
expressed
concern
about
the
tribes'
treaty
reservation
claim
against
south
carolina
but
a
bureau
bia
officer
assured
him
that
any
claim
the
catawbas
had
against
the
state
would
not
be
jeopardized
by
carrying
out
a
program
with
the
federal
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
judge
butzner
apparently
felt
that
comment
was
applicable
in
interpreting
the
meaning
of
congressional
legislation,
some
assurance
had
been
given
to
he
indians
that
if
they
made
this
deal
with
the
federal
government
it
wouldn't
affect
their
claim
against
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
says
this
happened
in
1958.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
this
state
statute
of
limitations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
purpose
of
congress
applying
the
statute
of
limitations...
it's
a
question
of
congress
withdrawing
a
status
which
prevented
the
state
statute
from
running.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
just
making
the
argument
that
when
congress
goes
about
applying
a
statute
of
limitations
and...
it
spells
it
out
very
specifically,
but
that's
when
the
statute
of
limitations
is
imposed
by
congress.
here,
all
congress
is
saying,
if
your
opponents
are
correct,
is
that
this
status,
particular
status
is
withdrawn
and
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
withdrawal
of
that
status
is
that
the
state
statute
now
begins
to
run.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
state
statutes
of
limitations
are
not
general
state
law?
