mr.
don
brantley
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
the
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
based
solely
on
the
effects
of
the
1959
act
of
congress,
and
that
motion
necessarily
assumed
that
as
of
1959
the
tribe's
1763
treaty
plans
were
still
under
the
full
protection
of
federal
law,
and
that
the
tribe's
recognized
indian
title
had
never
been
validly
disturbed
prior
to
1959.
the
principal
issue
decided
by
the
court
below,
and
the
main
issue
to
be
decided
here,
is
whether
congress
in
1959
intended
to
abrogate
the
special
federal
protections
that
applied
to
the
tribe's
1763
treaty
claim
to
140,000
acres
of
land,
in
addition
to
lifting
federal
restrictions
and
transferring
title
to
a
particular
3,400
acres
of
land
that
were
actually
distributed
pursuant
to
the
termination
act.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1959
act
provides
a
conclusive
answer
to
that
question.
it
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
remove
federal
protections
from
the
1763
treaty
lands.
what
congress
intended
to
do,
the
legislative
history
shows,
is
enact
legislation
that
was
fully
consistent
with
the
expressed
consent
of
the
catawba
tribe,
and
tribal
consent,
the
legislative
history
further
shows,
was
contained
in
a
tribal
resolution
that
expressly,
conditioned
the
tribe's
agreement
upon
leaving
the
status
of
its
1763
treaty
claim
unaffected.
at
the
congressional
hearings
on
the
1959
act,
congressman
robert
w.
hemphill,
the
bill's
sponsor,
left
absolutely
no
doubt
that
his
was
legislation
designed
solely
to
implement
the
expressed
desires
of
the
tribe
as
set
forth
in
the
tribal
resolution
of
january
3rd,
1959,
and
i
quote
congressman
hemphill's
testimony
before
the
interior
committee:
"i
refused
to
introduce
a
bill
until
the
catawba
tribe
requested
it.
"
"on
january
3rd,
1959
the
catawba
tribe
passed
the
following
resolution,
and
i
ask
permission
to
insert
that
resolution
at
this
point
as
a
part
of
the
record.
"
"as
a
result
of
that
resolution
i
asked
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
assist
me
in
the
preparation
of
a
bill,
and
i
introduced
the
bill
which
is
before
you
today.
"
and,
after
assuring
the
committee
that
the
bill
represented,
and
again
i
quote,
the
expressed
wishes
of
a
great
majority
of
the
indians,
congressman
hemphill
summarized
the
situation
to
the
committee,
and
i
quote:
"we
are
frankly
faced
with
this
alternative:
do
what
the
indians
want
or
leave
the
situation
in
its
present
status.
"
now,
the
interior
department
spokesman
also
described
these
events
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
bill
before
the
house
committee,
and
he
confirmed
that
the
department
had
drafted
legislation
for
the
congressman,
and
i
quote
his
testimony,
"along
the
lines
that,
we
thought
the
indians
had
been
discussing.
"
he
also
testified
that
the
interior
department
had
told
the
congressman
after
drafting
the
bill,
and
i
quote,
that
"before
we
could
report
favorably
on
the
bill,
we
thought
a
specific
bill
should
be
presented
to
the
indians
and
explained
to
them
in
detail
so
that
we
could
be
sure
this
was
the
type
of
program
they
wanted.
"
this
was
done
at
the
march
28th
meeting.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
reports
leave
no
doubt
that
congress
intended
to
enact
legislation
that
was
fully
consistent
with
the
expressed
agreement
and
consent
of
the
tribe.
both
refer
specifically
to
the
tribal
concurrences
given
at
that
january
3rd
meeting
and
the
march
28th
meeting
about
which
both
the
congressman
and
the
interior
department
spokesman
testified.
now,
the
congressman's
and
the
committee's
concern
for
tribal
understanding
and
consent
is
attributable
at
least
in
part
to
the
fact
that
in
1959
we
were
approaching
the
end
of
the
termination
era,
and
a
year
earlier
the
old
federal
termination
policy
of
coercive
termination
of
indian
tribes
had
been
rejected.
indeed,
the
last
three
acts
of
congress,
termination
acts
of
congress,
provided
for
explicit
tribal
agreement
and
the
earlier
termination
acts
did
not.
now,
the
new
federal
termination
policy
held
that
no
tribe
would
be
terminated,
in
the
words
of
secretary
of
the
interior
seaton,
and
i
quote,
"unless
such
tribe
or
group
has
clearly
demonstrated
first
that
it
understands
the
plan
under
which
such
a
program
would
go
forward,
and
second,
that
the
tribe
or
group
affected
concurs
in
and
supports
the
plan
proposed.
"
so,
the
tribe's
understanding
and
the
conditions
upon
which
their
consent
was
given
are
of
extreme
importance
here.
now,
what
were
the
specific
assurances
and
conditions
upon
which
the
catawba
tribal
consent
was
based?
well,
in
1958,
interior
department
officials
had
suggested
to
the
catawba
tribe
that
federal
restrictions
be
removed
from
their
3,400
acres
of
trust
land
that
had
been
acquired
only
16
years
earlier,
in
1943.
and
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
tribe
had
complained
that
a
joint
department
of
the
interior
and
south
carolina
relief
program
which
was
carried
out
pursuant
to
this
'43
memorandum
of
understanding
wasn't
working
for
the
tribe.
the
tribe
was
receiving
minimal
federal
services,
it
couldn't
productively
use
its
land,
and
the
bia
came
down
to
tribal
meetings
and
explained
to
the
catawba
indians
that
the
services
that
it
could
provide
were
limited
by
the
memorandum
of
understanding
and
that
it
didn't
have
any
more
money,
it
couldn't
provide
any
more
services
to
held
thorn
more
productively
use
their
land,
and
so
it
told
the
tribe
that
the
only
answer
to
their
problem
was
to
divide
these
tribal
assets,
remove
federal
restrictions
from
them,
and
divide
them
among
the
members,
but
the
catawba
tribal
officials
told
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
that
they
would
not
agree
to
such
a
division
of
the
federal
lands
without
their
1763
treaty
claim
being
resolved
first.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
they
did
not--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--no,
your
honor.
they
identified
it
as
the
claim
against
the
state.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
there
is
nothing
in
the
1959
act
legislative
history.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
no,
your
honor,
but
the
record
in
this
case
does
reveal
quite
clearly,
we
believe,
that
that
was
as
mr.
st.
clair
referred,
the
tribe's
shorthand
method
of
referring
to
its
treaty
claim,
the
word
"claim"
against
the
state.
in
1904
and
1909
the
tribe
had
petitioned
the
interior
department
to
get
its
land
back,
or
assistance
in
getting
its
land
back,
and
it
had
based
its
claim
on
the
non-intercourse
act,
claiming
the
1840
treaty
was
void.
sandwiched
in
between
those
requests
to
interior
was
a
1907
request
to
the
state
to
settle
this
claim.
this
is
found
in
our
brief
at
page
12
and
13,
and
the
words
of
the
tribe's
resolution
are,
and
i
quote:
"that
nothing
in
this
legislation
shall
affect
the
status
of
any
claim
against
the
state
of
south
carolina
by
the
catawba
tribe.
"
"now,
the
tribe
was
later
asked
to
approve
a
specific
bill
at
the
march
28th
meeting
that
we
have
referred
to,
and
both
the
bia
minutes
and
the
tribal
minutes
of
that
march
28th
meeting
are
especially
revealing
as
to
what
the
tribe
was
told
and
what
its
understanding
was.
"
congressman...
and
i
quote
from
the
bia
minutes
of
that
meeting
with
the
tribe...
congressman
hemphill
advised
the
group
that
the
proposed
bill
had
not
been
introduced
in
the
house
and
that
he
would
not
introduce
the
bill
without
the
approval
of
the
people.
he
then
read
the
resolution
passed
in
council
on
january
3rd,
1959,
and
continuing
from
the
bia
minutes:
"congressman
hemphill
advised
the
group
that
on
the
date
after
receiving
a
copy
of
council
resolution
passed
january
3rd,
1959,
he
proceeded
in
having
legislation
drawn
up
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
resolution.
"
based
upon
the
congressman's
assurance
the
tribe
approved
the
introduction
of
this
bill
which
contained
the
section
at
issue
here,
section
5,
as
enacted,
and
significantly
the
tribal
minutes
of
that
march
28th,
1959
meeting
refer
to
the
bill
not
as
a
bill
but
as,
and
i
quote,
"the
contract
drawn
up
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
"
your
honors,
this
legislative
history
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
1959
act
was
enacted
to
carry
out
an
understanding
with
the
catawba
tribe.
the
tribe
would
agree
to
a
division
of
the
federally
held
lands
and
the
cessation
of
minimum
federal
services
on
the
condition
that
the
act
would
not
affect
the
status
of
its
1763
treaty
claim.
if
congress
had
intended
to
nullify
the
express
condition
upon
which
tribal
consent
had
been
based,
why
did
it
not
notify,
the
tribe?
if
congress
had
intended
to
begin
the
running
of
a
state
statute
of
limitations,
where
was
the
notice
that
unless
the
tribe
filed
its
claim
within
a
period
of
years,
its
claim
would
be
extinguished
forever?
mr.
don
brantley
miller
i
understand
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
it's
simply
our
position
that
that's
not
a
very
strong
argument
because
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
the
act
as
it
was
enacted,
is
the
act
that
was
read
to
the
indians,
and
assured
by
their
congressmen
and
by
the
<bia>[=
bia]
that
it
did
not...
that
it
carried
out
the
intent
of
their
resolution--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
incidents
of
indian
title,
one
of
which
if
the
freedom
from
the
operation
of
state
law
defenses
based
upon
the
passage
of
time.
another
incident
of
indian
title
would
be--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
your
honor,
when
congress
has
intended
to
apply
a
statute
of
limitations
alone,
it
has
expressly
said
so,
as
it
did
in
29
u.s.c.
section
2415.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
i
understand
that
that's
the
issue,
your
honor,
but
the
question
is,
from
what
lands
was
that
status
removed
was
it
removed
from
144,000
acres
of
treaty
lands
or
was
it
removed
only
from
that
<three
thousand
four
hundred>
[=
3,400]
acres
that
was
actually
distributed?
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
taking
that
for
a
moment,
then,
the
1959
act
states
that...
does
not
say,
state
statutes
of
limitation
will
apply.
what
it
does
talk
about
is
the
application
of
general
state
law,
in
section
5,
and
if
we
apply
the
general
state
law
here
what
we
apply
is
a
separate
series
of
state
statutes
wholly
apart
from
state
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
oh,
no,
your
honor.
the
general
application
of
state
law
would
include
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
it
would
also
include
the
application
of
a
separate
series
of
state
statutes
which
we
lodged
with
the
court
on
december
10th,
statutes
which
remain
in
full
force
today,
which
establish
a
state
law
scheme
that
expressly
defeases
the
catawbas
of
their
title
to
the
land,
and
grants
fee
simple
title
to
the
lessees
who
occupied
the
land
back
in
the
early
1800's.
so,
these
statutes,
state
statutes,
wholly
apart
from
the
operation
of
state
statutes
of
limitations,
would
mean
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
catawbas
had
been
defeased
of
their
title
since
1840
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
so,
if
we
read
section
5
to
apply
to
not
only
to
the
3,400
acres--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
we
did
not
argue
this--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--we
did
not
argue
this
point
specifically,
that
it
would
result
in
an
immediate
extinguishment.
we
did
cite
to
this
series
of
state
statutes,
primarily
as
historical
background
and
the
manner
in
which
the
tribe
had
lost
possession
of
their
reservation.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
i
can
only
surmise,
your
honor,
these
were
unlettered
people--
mr.
don
brantley
miller
--they
had
been
assured,
your
honor,
that
nothing
in
this
statute
would
affect
the
status.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
they
didn't
have
legal
advice
until
1975,
your
honor.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
their
claim
had
survived.
they
had
continued
to
talk
about
it
for
generations
and
generations,
and
in
their
view...
and
it
had
been
treated
as
a
viable
claim
by
the
department
of
the
interior,
the
senate
committee
had
heard
testimony
about
the
claim
in
the
1930's,
the
state
was
trying
to
settle
the
claim
with
them
back
in
the
early
1900's,
and
was
still
trying
to
settle
the
claim
in
1943.
it
had
been...
they
thought
it
would
survive,
and
it
had
been
treated
as
viable
by...
off
and
on
by
the
interior
department
and
the
crate
for
many
years.
mr.
don
brantley
miller
well,
the
focus
of
that
1959
act
was
very
narrow.
it
was
intended
to
relieve
the
federal
government
and
it
was
proposed
by
the
federal
government
to
relieve
them
of
the
obligations
that
they
had
undertaken
in
1943.
and
that
was
the
sole
purpose,
was
to
divide
that
3,400
acres
and
return
the
state
and
the
tribe
to
its
pre-1943
status,
and
part
of
that
status
was
that
this
claim
was
unresolved
and
nobody
did
intended
to
resolve
it
when
they
entered
into
the
'43
agreement
and
they
expressly
left
it
outside
of
the
scope
of
matters
in
1959.
