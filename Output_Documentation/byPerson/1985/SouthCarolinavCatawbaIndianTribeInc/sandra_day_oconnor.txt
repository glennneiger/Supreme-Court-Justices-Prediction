mr.
st.
clair,
is
there
a
common
law
restraint
against
alienation
by
indian
tribes
in
their
tribal
lands?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
my
understanding,
and
so
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is,
do
you
think
the
statute
here,
section
935,
affected
the
common
law
restraints
against
alienation,
because
by
its
terms
it
says
that
statutes
of
the
united
states
that
affect
indians
will
be
inapplicable.
now,
what
about
any
common
law
restraint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
your
response
that
section
935,
even
though
it
says,
only
statutes
of
the
united
states,
means
something
more
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
common
law
restraint
exists
separate
and
apart
from
the
statutory
one,
that
argument--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
argument
is
that
the
notice
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
how
does
it
change
the
nature
of
the
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
congress
had
provided
otherwise,
which
on
occasion
it
has?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
question
is
whether
congress
provided
otherwise
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language
is
rather
clear.
it
isn't
quite
as
easy
as
i
think
you're
making
it
out
to
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
fourth
circuit
deal
with
the
south
carolina
statutes
that
were
supplied
to
us
recently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
recall
that
it
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
you
raise
that
in
the
fourth
circuit?
was
that
argued
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
behalf
of
the
tribe?
