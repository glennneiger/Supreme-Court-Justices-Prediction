justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
we
simply
said
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
entering
a
final
judgment
on
those
issues?
it
should
have
just
said
the
injunction
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
you
would
be.
so
why
are
you
making
this
argument?

justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
attempted
to
come
here
anyway
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
just
said
the
preliminary
injunction
was
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
wouldn't,
why
should
we
do
anything
more
than
affirm
them
as
to
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
urge
the
court
of
appeals
to
rule
finally
on
the
constitutionality?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction,
that
doesn't
mean
there
wouldn't
be
jurisdiction
by
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
never
held
that
finality
is
required
in
certiorari
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
has
been
enough
to
get
certiorari
here
in
many,
many
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
we
would
have
to
determine
to
deny
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
ask
us
to
treat
it
as
certiorari,
if
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction,
so
we
would
have
to
deny.
