mr.
gordon,
for
which
of
the
statutes
at
issue
here
is
there
in
your
view
a
need
for
additional
factual
record
before
a
final
adjudication
on
constitutionality
is
proper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
then
that
no
additional
factual
record
is
necessary
for
the
final
decision
on
any
of
these
statutes
and
their
validity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
abstention
is
appropriate
as
to
any
of
the
statutes
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
interpret
them?
