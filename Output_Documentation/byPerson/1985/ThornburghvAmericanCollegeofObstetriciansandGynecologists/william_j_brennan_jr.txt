justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
1254
when
you
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
because
congress
didn't
say
final
judgment
expressly,
the
inference
is
that
congress
intended
appealability
even
when
there
wasn't
a
final
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
you
base
your
argument
on
it
at
all,
what
does
that
do
with
1254(1),
which
allows
cert,
as
you
know,
before
or
after
rendition
of
a
judgment
or
decree?
wouldn't
that
be
superfluous
if
you
were
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
1254(1).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
final
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
it
is
nonetheless
appealable
under
1254(2).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
wondering
why
you
can't
read
1254(2)
as
congress
intending
the
long
time
requirement
of
final
judgment
obtained
here
and
that
1254(1)
was
simply
an
exception.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
can't
it
be
read
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
if
we
have
to
read
1254(2)
as
congress
telling
us
that
you
couldn't
appeal
anything
here
except
a
final
judgment,
that
controls
us,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
final
judgment,
then--
--that
is
the
end
of
it.
--that
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
getting
back,
if
i
may,
since
i
had
to
interrupt,
now,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
apparently
several
provisions
of
this
pennsylvania
statute
still
before
the
district
court,
are
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
to
the
five...
there
are
five
here,
are
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
to
those
five,
did
not
the
stipulation
of
facts
expressly
reserve
the
right
to
make
a
record
in
the
district
court
so
that
our
holdings
could
be,
i
gather,
changed
by
subsequent
factual
developments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
should
we
treat
with
these
important
questions
now?
where
do
we
actually
get
a
true
final
judgment
out
of
the
district
court
before
we
address
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
gordon,
did
i
correctly
understand
that
the
reservation
to
make
a
further
factual
showing
may
be
triggered
by
either
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
am
speaking
as
to
the
five
provisions
before
us.
you
have
a
stipulation
as
i
understood
it
that
expressly
reserved
the
right
to
make
a
record
in
the
district
court
as
to
the
five
issue
you
have
before
us.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
that
reservation
may
be
triggered
without
regard
to
what
the
court
may
think
by
either
party
to
the
stipulation?
