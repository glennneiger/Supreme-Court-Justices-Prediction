we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
thornburgh
against
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists.
mr.
gordon,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
kolbert?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
then
have
been
enough
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
because
of
possible
doubts
about
constitutionality
it
would
simply
enter
the
preliminary
injunction
and
let
events
take
their
normal
course?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
undoubtedly
when
lawyers
go
in
to
get
a
tro
or
even
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
they
aren't
ready
always
to
litigate
constitutionality
on
a
complex
matter,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
