mr.
gordon,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
governor
thornburgh
still
a
party
to
this
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
case
comes
up
here
in
a
posture
with
a
high
official
of
pennsylvania
as
the
lead
name,
and
he
vetoed
all
this
legislation.
it
seems
a
little
strange
situation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
are
taking
the
position
he
still
is
a
party?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
parties
have
agreed
that
he
should
go
out.
