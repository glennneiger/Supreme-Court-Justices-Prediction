mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
is
from
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit,
which
in
reviewing
a
preliminary
injunction
ruling
struck
down
numerous
provisions
of
pennsylvania's
abortion
control
act.
the
case
presents
a
variety
of
questions.
first,
the
court
must
decide
whether
an
appeal
lies
from
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
which
strikes
down
state
statutes
as
unconstitutional
but
which
remands
for
further
proceedings
on
additional
constitutional
claims.
next,
the
court
must
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals'
substantive
rulings
were
consistent
with
this
court's
recent
decisions
on
the
permissible
scope
of
abortion
regulation.
and
finally,
even
if
the
court
finds
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
law
to
the
limited
record
before
it,
the
court
must
decide
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
finally
declare
these
provisions
of
state
law
unconstitutional
before
the
state
has
been
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
defense
of
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
the
parties
did
agree
that
he
should
be
removed,
but
the
district
court
never
entered
an
order
on
that,
so
technically
i
believe
he
still
is
a
party,
but
he
will
be
removed
as
soon
as
it
is
returned
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
issues
an
order.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
if
i
may,
he
vetoed
a
prior
bill.
this
particular
statute
he
did
sign,
and
he
approved
this
statute.
now,
before
discussing
the
question--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--there
has
been
no
order
of
dismissal
issued.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes.
it
is
our
understanding
until
the
court
issues
an
order
dismissing
him
that
he
is
still
a
party.
now,
before
reaching
the
questions
presented
to
the
court
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
sketch
very
briefly
the
procedural
history
of
the
case,
which
is
relevant
to
the
issues
before
the
court.
the
statute
was
passed
in
june
of
1982,
and
it
was
not
until
october
that
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
about
one
month
later,
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
and
they
attached
to
this
motion
40
detailed
affidavits.
on
november
18th
of
1982,
the
district
court
issued
a
procedural
order
to
govern
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
and
as
a
part
of
this
order,
the
district
court
directed
the
parties
to
agree
on
stipulations,
and
also
prohibited
any
party
from
contesting
any
fact
at
the
hearing
unless
that
party
had
positive
evidence
to
offer
in
support
of
that
particular
fact.
so,
stipulations
were
agreed
upon,
but
they
were
agreed
upon
solely
for
the
purposes
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
and
they
were
largely
drawn
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
complainant's
affidavits.
the
district
court
with
one
minor
exception
denied
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
after
lengthy
consideration,
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
numerous
provisions
of
pennsylvania's
statute.
first,
the
jurisdictional
question.
as
i
said,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
an
appeal
lies
to
this
court
from
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
striking
down
some
provisions
of
state
law
but
remanding
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
on
additional
constitutional
claims.
the
appeal
statute
does
not
expressly
require
that
to
be
appealable
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
must
finally
dispose
of
all
constitutional
issues,
and
in
fact--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--twelve
fifty-four
two,
that's
right.
in
fact--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--i
think
it
certainly
permits
that
conclusion,
but
that
is
not
our
entire
argument.
we
don't
base
our
entire
argument
on
the
omission
of
the
word
"final".
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
no,
i
don't
believe
so;
1254(2)
applies
to
a
very
narrow
class
of
cases.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
i
know,
and
1254(1)
obviously
applies
to
the
broader
range
of
cases.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
held
for
cert
that
there
need
be
a
final
order.
i
think
it
is
entirely
consistent,
and
in
fact
the
original
version
of
the
statute
enacted
in
1925
from
which
1254(1)
and
1254(2)
are
derived
were
worded
similarly
and
very
broadly.
namely,
both
of
those
sections,
and
more
particularly
the
predecessor
of
1254(2),
provided
for
an
appeal
in
any
case
in
a
court
of
appeals
if
the
decision
was
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute.
and
certainly
the
decision
under
review
here
satisfies
those
general
requirements.
the
decision...
the
case
was
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
decision
was
against
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
we
don't
argue
that
there
is
a
final
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes,
we
do.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
we
understand--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
the
absence
of
the
word
"final"
permits
a
reading
either
way,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
general
rule
of
finality
does
not,
cannot,
and
should
not
be
followed
when
there
are
particular
policies
which
are
relevant
to
a
specific
statute,
and
which
support
the
conclusion
that
non-final
review
should
be
permitted.
as
to
the
particular
statute
involved
in
this
case,
namely
1254(2)--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
if
you
interpret
it
as
requiring
a--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--then
we
request
that
the
court
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
that
is
our
alternative
argument.
as
i
was
saying,
in
this
particular
statute,
congress
was
concerned
about
the
effect
on
federal-state
relations,
which
comes
about
when
a
federal
court
strikes
down
a
state
statute,
and
while
the
power
to
declare
state
statutes
unconstitutional
obviously
is
necessary
if
we
are
to
preserve
the
federalist
system,
congress
believed
that
states
should
be
entitled
to
enforce
their
laws
absent
this
court's
decision
of
unconstitutionality.
this
policy--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--that's
right.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that
was
certainly
the
intention
at
the
time
when
that
stipulation
was
entered
into.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
issued
a
final
judgment
as
to
these
particular
statutes
in
this
case.
there
is
no
other
way
to
interpret
their
decision
other
than
it
being
a
final
declaration
as
to
these
provisions
that
we
have
brought
before
the
court
this
morning
that
they
are
unconstitutional,
that
they
cannot
be
enforced,
and
that
there
is
nothing
that
we
could
prove
on
remand
or
should
be
able
to
prove
on
remand
that
would
change
that
result,
so
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
no,
we
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
let
me
tell
you
why.
i
don't
think
that
would
really
get
us
anywhere
for
this
reason.
plainly,
if
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional,
they
would
have
if
they
applied
the
proper
standard
of
review
at
the
time
found
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
on
the
merits,
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
conclusion
was
plainly
incorrect.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
i
am
not
certain
that
we
would
have.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
the
difference
is
this,
first
of
all,
that
that
isn't
what
they
did,
and
it
is
clear,
i
would
think,
that
if
that
is
all
this
court
does,
then
it
would
be
an
exercise
in
futility
for
us
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
anyhow,
because
no
district
judge
is
going
to
be
able
to
look
beyond
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
merits,
and
feels
rather
strongly,
to
say
the
least,
that
these
provisions
are
unconstitutional.
as
i
was
saying,
this
policy--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--let
me
say
that
it
is
our
position
based
upon
the
appellee's
apparent
conception
that
they
have
no
additional
evidence
to
offer
that
the
court
may
reach
the
merits
and
uphold
these
statutes
based
on
this
record.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position
on
the
merits--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--we
take
the
position
that
the
court
may
uphold
these
statutes
based
on
this
record.
however,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
law
to
the
limited
record
before
it
in
finding
that
there
were
problems
with
the
statute,
then
we
have
evidence
to
offer
on
most
of
the
provisions.
i
would
say
probably
the
one
exception
is
the
second
position
requirement,
where
the
only
contest
is
whether
or
not
you
can
read
this
particular
statute
as
including
an
exception
for
an
emergency.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
additional
evidence
we
have
to
offer
on
that
provision,
but
on
the
others,
i
think
there
are
additional
justifications
by
way
of
facts
that
we
can
offer
if
the
court
deems
that
necessary.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
feasible.
pennsylvania
has
no
particular
certification
procedure
that
we
could
use
to
get
a
ruling
on
the
interpretation
of
these
statutes,
so
i
am
not
sure
that
extension
would
be
a
feasible
alternative,
and
frankly,
i
don't
understand
abstention
to
be
the
proper
course
when
the
statutes
can
clearly
be
interpreted
in
a
constitutional
manner,
and
that
certainly
is
our
argument.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
at
the
district
court
level?
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
absolutely.
in
fact,
it
was
done
in
this
case.
there
was
a
reservation.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
as
to
those
and
all
of
the
issues
that
were
involved,
yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that
was
certainly
our
understanding
when
we
entered
into
it.
the
difference
at
this
level
is
that
based
upon
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
appellees
take
the
position
they
have
nothing
additional
to
offer,
so
there
has
been
a
change
since
we
entered
into
that
stipulation.
now,
just
to
finish
up
the
jurisdictional
point,
it
is
our
position
that
this
interest
that
congress
recognized
in
the
appeals
statute
is
as
surely
damaged
by
an
interim
decision
such
as
this
one
as
it
is
by
a
final
one,
and
it
requires
that
cases
such
as
this
one
be
appealed.
we
request
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
over
this
appeal.
the
court
has
recognized
that
a
woman
in
appropriate
circumstances
is
entitled
to
have
an
abortion
free
from
state
regulation.
but
at
the
same
time
the
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
there
is
a
permissible
role
for
the
states
to
play
in
ensuring
the
protection
of
maternal
health
and
life.
in
passing
the
statute
under
review
here,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
attempted
to
strike
the
balance
which
this
court
has
mandated
in
its
decisions.
in
some
respects,
based
upon
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court,
the
legislature
misstepped,
and
so
we
conceded
the
invalidity
of
several
provisions
of
the
act
while
we
were
still
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
as
to
the
provisions
that
we
have
brought
to
the
court
this
morning,
the
legislature
clearly
showed
a
proper
regard
for
the
rules
which
this
court
has
prescribed.
for
example,
the
pennsylvania
statute
provides
that
a
second
physician
should
be
present
at
abortions
performed
after
viability.
now,
it
is
common
ground
among
the
parties
that
the
state
may
require
that
a
second
physician
be
present,
and
the
parties
also
agree
that
there
must
be
an
exception
to
this
requirement
if
an
emergency
prevents
the
attendance
of
a
second
physician.
we
differ
only
on
whether
this
statute
contains
such
an
exception.
in
our
view,
a
view
shared
by
chief
judge
sikes
below,
the
statute
clearly
provides
for
such
an
exception.
it
is
a
complete
defense
to
any
charge
brought
under
the
section
of
which
the
second
physician
requirement
is
a
part
that
the
abortion
was
necessary
to
preserve
maternal
life
or
health.
this
exception
is
plain.
it
is
far
plainer
than
the
one
which
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
acceptable
in
the
ashcroft
case,
and
so
this
provision
clearly
should
be
upheld.
next,
the
informed
consent
requirement.
the
notion
that
patients
are
entitled
to
relevant
information
before
submitting
to
a
course
of
medical
treatment
is
well
accepted
in
the
law.
this
doctrine
of
informed
consent
has
been
developed
by
the
courts
and
the
legislatures--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--okay.
the
informed
consent
provision
is
section
3205
of
pennsylvania
statute.
as
i
mentioned,
the
doctrine
of
informed
consent
has
been
developed
by
the
courts
and
the
legislatures
to
protect
the
patient,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
this
requirement
may
be
extended
to
the
abortion
procedure,
that
women
are
entitled
to
know
what
will
be
done,
the
consequences
of
their
choice,
and
the
alternatives
to
abortion.
in
fact,
the
court
has
indicated
more
recently
in
the
affrin
case
and
by
way
of
a
summary
affirmance
regarding
pennsylvania's
prior
statute
that
a
state
permissibly
may
set
forth
general
requirements,
categories
of
information
which
must
be
given
to
a
woman
to
ensure
her
informed
consent,
and
there
is
a
very
real
need
for
this
type
of
statute.
the
pennsylvania
legislature
specifically
found
and
the
evidence
revealed
that
women,
despite
existing
requirements
for
informed
consent,
are
not
always
being
provided
with
relevant
information,
and
it
has
been
reported
that
some
clinics
encourage
women
to
undergo
abortion
by
withholding
information
which
might
cause
them
to
bear
the
child
to
term.
the
pennsylvania
statute
does
not
put
words
in
the
mouth
of
the
counselor
or
the
physician,
and
it
describes
only
in
general
terms
the
information
which
should
be
offered.
it
contains
no
parade
of
horribles,
no
statements
of
dubious
validity,
and
it
gives
doctors
and
counselors
the
room
they
need
to
tailor
the
exchange
to
the
needs
of
each
individual
patient.
these
requirements
hardly
erect
an
unconstitutional
obstacle
to
abortion.
next,
the
reporting
requirements
which
are
found
in
section
3214
of
pennsylvania's
statute.
these
reports
which
are
described
in
the
statute
are
easily
completed,
and
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
minimal
effort
required
to
complete
these
forms
translates
into
a
restriction
on
abortions.
the
reporting
of
data
on
abortions
plainly
serves
important
health
interests
by
advancing
the
study
of
this
medical
procedure,
and
there
is
no
serious
contest
over
the
relevance
of
this
information,
much
of
which
already
is
reported
to
federal
officials.
of
course,
if
this
information
is
to
be
of
any
value
in
research,
it
must
be
available
to
researchers
who
are
studying
this
problem.
and
the
statute
adequately
protects
confidentiality
by
deleting
the
names
of
the
patient
and
the
doctor
and
providing
severe
penalties
for
unauthorized
disclosure.
next,
pennsylvania
in
section
3206
of
the
statute
has
provisions
which
require
minors
to
obtain
parental
consent
or
judicial
approval
for
abortions.
pennsylvania's
statute
clearly
satisfies
the
general
requirements
which
this
court
has
prescribed
in
this
area.
now,
appellees
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statute
is
too
general,
and
that
it
must
be
augmented
by
procedural
rules.
in
the
absence
of
such
rules,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
this
argument
and
enjoined
the
statute.
since
that
time,
rules
have
been
issued,
and
yet
appellees
continue
their
attack
on
the
statute,
an
attack
which
in
some
respects
is
similar
to
the
one
they
presented
below,
and
in
other
respects
has
shifted
focus
to
take
account
of
the
new
rules.
but
the
essential
question
whether
this
statute
is
constitutional
is
still
a
live
question.
the
specific
inquiries
have
been
altered
somewhat
by
these
new
rules,
but
certainly
the
court
faces
no
insurmountable
obstacle
in
addressing
the
appellee's
facial
complaints.
all
that
is
required
in
the
way
of
procedure
for
a
provision
like
this
is
that
the
minor
be
provided
with
an
effective
opportunity
to
obtain
judicial
approval,
and
these
rules
and
the
statute
together
provide
as
adequately
as
they
can
for
quick,
confidential
proceedings.
they
do
not,
as
the
appellees
suggest,
permit
parental
involvement
in
every
case.
the
state
courts
are
given
authority
to
appoint
counsel,
to
appoint
a
guardian,
but
are
left
with
their
traditional
discretion
in
these
matters.
this
statute
is
plainly
constitutional.
it
is
an
important
provision,
and
it
should
be
permitted
to
go
into
effect
immediately.
the
final
provision
of
pennsylvania's
statute
which
is
before
the
court
involves
the
choice
of
abortion
technique
or
method
which
must
he
used
during
abortions
performed
after
viability.
this
statute
provides
limited
protection
to
the
viable
fetus.
it
requires
that
after
viability
the
doctor
used
the
abortion
technique
which
is
least
risky
to
the
fetus
unless
that
technique
would
pose
a
significantly
greater
risk
to
the
life
or
the
health
of
the
woman.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
state
may
require
that
a
woman
sacrifice
her
life
or
health
to
preserve
the
chances
for
survival
of
the
fetus,
and
in
our
view
this
statute,
by
using
the
phrase
"significantly
greater
risk",
does
no
more
than
use
a
term
which
is
familiar
to
physicians
and
researchers
in
this
field,
namely,
a
difference
in
relative
risk
that
is
statistically
or
scientifically
meaningful.
in
all
research,
statistical
experts,
medical
researchers
recognize
that
even
under
the
best
of
circumstances,
under
the
best
design
test,
there
may
be
differences
in
relative
risk
which
are
not
scientifically
or
medically
meaningful,
and
this
statute
does
no
more
than
recognize
this
common
understanding.
for
these
reasons
and
those
outlined
at
greater
length
in
our
brief,
the
conclusions
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
plainly
incorrect,
and
they
should
be
reversed.
but
even
if
the
court
decides
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
law
to
the
limited
record
before
it,
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
court
finally
to
declare
these
provisions
of
state
law
unconstitutional
before
the
state
has
been
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
support
of
the
statute.
at
the
very
least,
the
decision
should
be
vacated
and
any
order
limited
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
further.
