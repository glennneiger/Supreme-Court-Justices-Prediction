ms.
kathryn
kolbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
at
least
12
occasions
since
1973
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
define
the
scope
of
a
woman's
fundamental
right
to
choose
abortion.
only
two
years
ago
this
court
decided
akron
and
ashcroft,
and
forcefully
reaffirmed
the
landmark
case
of
roe
versus
wade.
if
this
court
reaches
the
merits,
the
parties
agree
that
the
sound
constitutional
principles
in
akron
and
roe
and
all
of
the
cases
following
it
are
controlling.
before
addressing
the
merits,
however,
i
will
first
address
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction.
appellants
concede
that
this
case
is
interlocutory,
that
it
arose
as
an
appeal
from
the
ruling
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
appellants
also
concede
in
their
briefs
that
finality
has
always
been
the
prerequisite
to
the
mandatory
appeal
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
section
1254(2).
with
no
support
and
precedent,
the
commonwealth
asked
the
court
to
reject
a
rule
that
has
been
an
integral
part
of
appeal
practice
throughout
this
century.
although
congress
has
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
appeal
statutes
several
times
in
the
last
60
years,
it
has
never
modified
section
1254(2)
to
disturb
the
finality
requirement.
if
there
is
a
need
to
change
this
finality
rule,
congress
can
and
will
do
so.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
it
does
not,
but
in
1891,
in
a
case
called
macleish
versus
roth,
this
court
found
that
the
absence
of
the
word
"finality"
did
not
mean
that
finality
was
not
required.
this
court
applied
the
finality
rule
to
appeal
statutes,
and
congress
knew
that
when
passing
this
section
240
which
was
the
predecessor
to
section
1254(2).
since
that
time,
this
court
has
specifically
applied
finality
to
the
section
1254(2)
and
this
court
has
never
retreated
from
those
rulings.
the
importance
of
the
finality
rule
is
really
very
well
demonstrated
by
this
case.
given
its
piecemeal
nature,
it
is
very
possible
that
this
case
could
come
before
the
court
at
least
twice
and
possibly
three
to
four
times
if
appellant's
argument
is
to
hold
weight.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
easily
done
what
it
did,
which
is
reach
facial
constitutionality
of
the
five
provisions
which
it
held
unconstitutional,
because
as
a
matter
of
law
the
district
court
had
applied
both
the
wrong
standard
and
there
was
no
possible
way
to
construe
the
statutes
in
a
constitutional
manner,
but
yes,
we
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
asking
for
the
vacation
of
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
and
that
would
have
been
fine
for
us
at
that
time.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
no,
and
we
were
not,
your
honor.
this
case
came
up
before
the
akron
and
ashcroft
cases
were
decided.
we
believed
that
this
court
was...
at
that
time
that
the
court
was
about
to
rule
very
conclusively
on
these
matters,
and
had
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
until
this
court
ruled
on
those
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
then...
at
that
point
it
was
in
the
district
court,
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
matter
until
this
court
ruled
and
could
apply
the
rulings
of
these
courts
on
this
question.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
the
first
time
that
we
were
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
urged
them
to
await
this
court's
rulings
in
akron
and
ashcroft.
on
the
second
time
that
we
appeared
before
them,
we
did
feel
that
the
rulings
in
akron
and
ashcroft
were
conclusive
as
to
the
facial
validity
of
several
of
the
provisions.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
policies
that
underlie
the
finality
rule,
that
is,
the
policies
of
minimizing
the
docket
of
the
court
and
the
policy
against
piecemeal
review
would
also
apply.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
no,
your
honor,
but
there
are
some
requirements
of
certiorari
jurisdiction
which
are
not
met
here.
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
circuits
in
these
matters.
although
it
is
a
significant
issue,
it
will
be
before
this
court
on
mandatory--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
the
case
will
return
to
the
court
under
its
mandatory
appeal
jurisdiction
when
the
matter
has
been
finally
resolved.
we
are
not
saying
the
court
should
never
hear
these
questions,
only
when--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--this
court
would
only
have
to
determine--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--you
would
have
to
deny
certiorari.
that
is
correct.
in
the
event--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--your
honor,
this
court
has
long
distinguished
section
1254(2)
from
section
1252,
which
was
the
walters
case,
and
in
fact
1252
does
contain
explicit
language
that
allows
both
appeals
from
final
orders
and
appeals
from
interlocutory
orders.
we
believe
that
the
appeal
provisions
have
been
treated
differently,
basically
because
in
the
walters
situation
there
was
an
appeal
from
a
finding
that
a
federal
statute
was
unconstitutional.
in
the
event
that
the
court
reaches
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
address
the
post-viability
provisions
that
are
before
the
court,
and
then
discuss
the
reporting
and
informed
consent
provisions.
appellees
rely
on
our
briefs
for
the
parental
consent
and
the
second
doctor
requirements.
pennsylvania
makes
it
a
felony
to
perform
a
post-viability
abortion
unless
it
is
necessary
to
protect
a
woman's
life
or
health.
this
prohibition
is
not
at
issue
here.
what
is
at
issue
is
additional
standards,
additional
standard
of
care
requirements
and
choice
of
abortion
methods
that
are
imposed
on
a
very
small
class
of
women
who
have
life
or
health-threatening
problems
that
force
the
termination
of
pregnancy
at
this
late
stage.
post-viability
abortions
are
extremely
rare.
they
are
performed
on
women
who
desperately
want
to
have
their
children,
but
unfortunately
due
to
some
kind
of
underlying
medical
disease
or
pregnancy-related
disease
are
forced
to
terminate
the
pregnancy.
under
threat
of
criminal
sanction,
the
pennsylvania
statute
requires
two
things.
first,
it
requires
the
physician
to
use
the
standard
of
care
that
he
would
use
as
if
the
fetus
were
to
be
born
prematurely
rather
than
being
aborted,
regardless
of
the
consequences
to
the
woman's
health.
second,
the
physician
must
use
the
abortion
technique
most
likely
to
result
in
a
live
born
fetus
unless
that
technique
would
cause
a
significantly
greater
medical
risk
to
the
woman.
now,
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
significantly
greater
language
on
its
face
directly
intrudes
upon
the
ability
of
a
physician
to
give
his
primary
allegiance
to
his
patient,
that
is,
the
woman,
and
forces
the
physician
to
trade
off
the
woman's
best
medical
care
in
order
to
only
marginally
increase
the
chance
of
fetal
survival.
the
commonwealth
concedes
that
such
a
trade-off
is
impermissible,
but
they
ask
this
court
to
delete
the
word
"significantly"
in
order
to
cure
the
constitutional
problems.
to
do
that,
to
delete
the
word
"significantly",
this
court
would
be
forced
to
rewrite
the
statute,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
can
do
that.
but
the
statute,
even
if
the
word
"significantly"
were
deleted,
contains
other
problems.
it
requires
doctors
to
compare
risks
of
differing
abortion
methods
that
are
impossible
to
compare.
for
example,
a
physician
could
use
a
prostaglandin
method
or
a
saline
method
on
a
woman
who
had
diabetes
or
who
had
hypertension
or
combined,
which
is
frequently
the
case.
each
method
carries
approximately
the
same
risk
of
mortality
in
a
mathematical
sense.
the
prostaglandin
method,
however,
will
increase
the
risk
of
stroke,
and
the
saline
method
would
increase
the
risk
of
uncontrolled
diabetes.
what
the
doctor
is
required
to
do
here
is
to
compare
those
two
risks,
to
say
is
the
risk
of
stroke
a
significantly
greater
medical
risk
than
the
risk
of
uncontrolled
diabetes,
and
it
is
that
comparison
that
is
impossible
to
make,
especially
without
consulting
his
patient
as
to
which
risk
she
is
likely
or
wanting
to
accept.
the
question
then
becomes
as
a
result
of
the
statutory
language,
the
vague
language,
and
the
impossibility
of
the
judgment
that
the
doctor
is
required
to
make
what
is
going
to
happen.
it
is
our
belief
that
criminal
sanctions
are
likely
to
produce
one
of
two
results.
either
the
physician
will
not
provide
medical
care
in
these
circumstances
for
fear
of
criminal
liability
or
the
doctor
will
use
the
technique
which
is
the
most
fetal
saving
to
the
detriment
of
women's
health,
and
it
is
that
problem,
putting
the
doctor
making
these
judgments,
that
is
problematic.
moreover,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point,
the
prostaglandin
method
or
the
saline,
in
choosing
between
the
two
methods,
although
the
prostaglandin
method
is
a
little
less
fetal
toxic
than
the
saline
method,
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that
both
methods
are
extremely
likely
to
cause
the
death
of
a
fetus.
so
that
to
inject
that
criteria
as
a
critical
factor
in
deciding
which
method
to
use
makes
no
medical
sense
and
therefore
puts
the...
and
puts
the
physician
into
threat
of
criminal
sanction.
like
the
statute
found...
also
like
the
statute
found
invalid
under
the
colautti
decision,
the
standard
of
care
requirement
which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
method
requirement
contains
no
life
or
health
exception.
it
therefore
compels
the
physician
to
treat
a
woman
already
suffering
from
serious
health
problems
as
if
she
were
perfectly
healthy.
for
example,
steroids
often
given
to
women
in
the
late
stages
of
pregnancy
when
they
go
into
very
premature
labor
in
order
to
increase
fetal
lung
capacity
and
improve
the
chance
or
the
likelihood
of
fetal
survival,
this
kind
of
treatment
is
contraindicated
to
women
who
suffer
severe
diseases,
and
in
fact
would
be
contraindicated
for
many
of
the
women
who
are
needing
this
kind
of
treatment,
who
are
needing
the
abortion
in
the
first
instance.
the
statute,
however,
has
no
exception
for
the
life
or
health
of
the
mother,
and
therefore
requires
the
physician
to
provide
medical
care
in
a
manner
that
is
contrary
to
his
best
judgment.
for
these
reasons,
the
standard
of
care
and
the
choice
of
method
requirements
must
be
found
unconstitutional.
turning
to
the
reporting
requirements,
the
reporting
requirements
contained
in
the
pennsylvania
act
are
unprecedented
in
their
scope.
they
under
pain
of
criminal
sanction
again
require
physicians
to
report
over
40
different
types
of
information,
including
the
basis
of
the
physician's
own
medical
judgment
about
each
individual
woman
who
obtains
an
abortion.
in
addition
to
the
separate
reports
that
must
be
filed,
these
reports
must
be
open
for
public
inspection
and
copying,
particularly
in
this
area
where
public
disclosure
is
likely
to
result
in
an
increase
of
violence,
intimidation,
and
harassment
directed
against
providers
of
abortion
services,
and
thereby
chilling
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
both
to
the
woman
and
the
physician.
the
reporting
requirements
cannot
withstand
scrutiny.
these
reports
go
way
beyond
those
found
constitutional
by
this
court
in
danforth,
recordkeeping
requirements
that
were
characterized
there
as
approaching
impermissible
limits.
given
these
burdens,
the
commonwealth
must
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
reporting
requirements.
this
they
haven't
done
and
they
cannot
do.
in
fact,
the
pennsylvania
department
of
health's
past
practice
has
shown
that
patient
care
may
suffer
if
abortion
providers
and
women
are
subjected
to
increased
levels
of
harassment.
indeed,
when
required
to
justify
the
reporting
requirements
and
the
public
disclosure
requirements
of
another
section
of
this
act
that
was
before
the
district
court
on
remand,
the
commonwealth
did
not
assert
a
public
health
interest
at
all.
rather,
they
argued
that
such
disclosure
was
justified
because
it
advanced
first
amendment
rights
of
protestors.
even
the
centers
for
disease
control
which
in
their
briefs
the
commonwealth
acknowledges
to
be
the
leading
public
agency
in
the
collection
of
health
data
is
able
to
use
aggregate
reports
that
adequately
protect
the
confidentiality
of
both
the
doctors
and
the
women
involved.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
the
reports
have
not
yet
become
public.
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeals
injunction
on
these
provisions
and
a
subsequent
injunction
by
the
district
court
as
to
other
provisions,
the
reports
have
not
become
public,
and
earlier
pennsylvania
law
which
i
may
say
satisfied
the
cdc
requirements
for
health
data
kept
the
reports
totally
confidential.
so,
to
my
knowledge,
in
pennsylvania
no
malpractice
claims
have
been
used.
there
have,
however,
been
a
number
of
cases
around
the
country
where
women's
identities
have
been
disclosed
through
reports,
either
in
hospitals
or
through
information
that
has
been
collected
by
opponents
of
abortion
outside
abortion
clinics.
for
example,
opponents
have
taken
pictures
of
women
entering
clinics,
copied
down
license
plate
numbers,
and
tried
to
track
down
individual
women.
as
a
result
of
that,
there
have
been
many
suits
that
have
been
brought,
not
many,
but
several
suits
that
have
been
brought
to
try
to
sue
the
opponents
of
abortion
for
those
practices.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
the
reports
at
issue
here
are
not
being
kept.
the
reports
under
section
3207
and
3214f
which
were
the
subject
of
the
lower
court
proceedings
after
remand
which
involved
corporate
identification
and
the
number
of
abortions
performed
per
trimester
are
being
kept
but
they
are
under
order
to
be
no
public
disclosure.
the
reporting
requirements,
as
i
said,
therefore
must
be
held
invalid,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
quickly
to
the
informed
consent
requirements
in
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
finding
the
informed
consent
provisions
of
the
pennsylvania
law
unconstitutional
must
be
affirmed.
to
do
so,
the
court
need
only
apply
the
akron
decision.
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
after
the
court
decided
the
akron
decision,
the
commonwealth
conceded
the
unconstitutionality
of
both
the
24-hour
waiting
period
and
the
doctor
only
counseling
requirements
which
are
contained
in
section
3205,
the
very
provision
that
is
before
this
court.
because
the
section
is
not
severable,
like
the
ordinance
in
akron,
the
entire
informed
consent
provisions
must
fall.
the
specific
informational
requirements,
however,
are
invalid
in
their
own
right
for
the
same
two
equally
decisive
reasons
that
this
court
condemned
the
akron
ordinance.
first,
the
information
is
designed
not
to
inform
a
woman
but
to
persuade
her
to
withhold
her
consent
altogether.
and
second,
the
statute
prohibits
the
physician
from
specifically
tailoring
the
informed
consent
dialogue
to
the
needs
of
the
patient.
now,
counsel
for
the
appellants
this
morning
said,
well,
the
doctor
is
free
to
tailor
the
information.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
anywhere
within
it,
and
that
under
the
ruling
in
akron
is
an
equally
decisive
reason
for
striking
down
these
provisions.
this
statute
requires--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--yes,
he
is,
your
honor.
it
is
either
the
physician
or
a
counselor,
a
designated
agent.
that
appears
in
the
second
set
of
requirements
in
the
act.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
it
is
our
view
that
to
tell
the
woman
that
the
father
is
liable
for
support,
given
the
national
crisis
in
the
collection
of
child
support
enforcement
orders
that
congress
has
recognized,
and
the
difficulty
in
the
collecting
of
support
may
in
many
cases
be
misleading,
but
in
addition
to
inform
that,
to
use...
to
provide
that
information
to
certain
women,
such
as
a
rape
victim
who
must
be
informed
that
her
assailant
is
liable
for
the
support
of
her
child
if
she
carries
the
pregnancy
to
term
can
be
extremely
cruel
and
traumatic
in
that
situation,
and
may
force
her
to
relive
that
trauma.
it
is
those
very
situations
that
that
information
may
not
be
appropriate
at
different
times.
it
is
our
view
that
the
statute
must
allow
the
physician
to
tailor
the
information
to
the
specific
needs
of
this
patient,
and
he
can't
do
that,
or
the
counselor
can't
do
that
given
the
mandates
of
the
provision.
the
statute,
as
i
said,
is
both
cruel
and
inaccurate
in
some
situations,
and
misleading,
and
also
requires
the
provision
of
irrelevant
information
which
can
harm
the
health
of
the
woman
in
certain
instances.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
informing
a
woman
that
there
are
unforeseeable
risks
to
an
abortion
is
an
inaccurate
statement
given
that
abortion
is
the
most
studied
medical
procedure
in
american
medicine
today,
and
can
only
be
intended
by
the
legislature
to
arouse
unwarranted
fears
of
the
woman.
in
addition,
it
is
irrelevant
to
provide
information
such
that
medical
assistance
payments
are
available
or
information
that
the
state
strongly
urges
the
woman
to
contact
particular
agencies
and
consult
private
social
agencies
that
are
run
by
opponents
of
abortion
in
situations
where
the
woman
needs
the
abortion
in
order
to
protect
her
life.
in
those
circumstances
not
only
is
it
irrelevant,
but
it
could
be
harmful
to
the
woman's
health,
and
the
facts
in
the
record
do
show
that.
accordingly,
the
informed
consent
provisions
must
be
held
in
invalid.
in
conclusion,
the
pennsylvania
act
constitutionally
infringes
on
the
rights
of
women
in
consultation
with
their
physicians
to
make
critical
decisions
about
abortion
and
to
interfere
with
women's
ability
to
control
their
own
lives
and
health.
it
has
been
argued
to
this
court
that
the
controversy
surrounding
the
abortion
issues
requires
a
retreat
from
the
principles
both
espoused
by
this
court
in
rowe
and
reaffirmed
most
recently
in
akron,
yet
it
is
precisely
this
controversy
that
compels
a
clear
and
unwaivering
dedication
to
those
sound
and
fundamental
principles.
this
court's
steadfast
adherence
to
rowe
and
akron
is
the
only
way
to
guarantee
the
protection
of
the
cherished
individual
liberties
at
stake.
accordingly,
foe
has
asked
this
court
to
dismiss
this
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
or
in
the
alternative
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
