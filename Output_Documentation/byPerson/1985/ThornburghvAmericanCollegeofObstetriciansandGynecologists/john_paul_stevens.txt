justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gordon,
it
would
help
me
a
little
bit
if
in
your
argument
you
would
identify
the
sections
you
are
talking
about
as
you
go
along.
i
caught
up
on
the
other
one,
but
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
kolbert,
in
the
reply
brief
that
your
opponent
filed,
they
point
out
the
walters
case
where
it
came
up
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
applicability
of
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
these
reports
have
not
been
made
public.
i
assume
they
aren't
even
being...
they
probably
aren't
even
being
kept,
are
they,
with
the
injunction
in
effect?
