how
about
the
contracts
to
kill
the
person?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
the
victim
a
resident
of
alabama?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
apart
from
the
double
jeopardy
argument,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
normal
minimum
contacts
rules
don't
apply
in
criminal
proceedings
as
well
as
in
civil
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
ones?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
that
decided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
somewhat
before
international
shoe,
then,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
i
mean,
we
are
not
back
in
pennoyer
against
neff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
assert.
i
was
simply
asking
you
a
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should...
as
a
matter
of
principle,
why
should
it
be
any
different
in
a
criminal
case
than
in
a
civil
case,
if
you
are
talking
about
"jurisdiction"
apart
from
double
jeopardy
considerations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
take
just
the
facts
of
this
case.
supposing
that
on
these
facts,
georgia
for
some
reason
or
other
had
said
we
just
don't
want
to
prosecute
this
case.
we
think
the
case
is
weak.
we
don't
think
a
georgia
jury
would
convict.
would
alabama
then
be
prevented
from
trying
this
particular
defendant
for
murder
on
these
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
have
an
unequivocal
answer
to
my
question.
