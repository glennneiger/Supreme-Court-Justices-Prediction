justice

may
i
be
unfair
and
ask
you
to
explain
to
me
your
opponent's
argument
as
to
how
alabama
gets
sovereignty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
have
a
problem
that
there
weren't
two
murders.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
only
way
you
could
analogize
those
hypotheticals
with
this
one
is
that
you
kill
him
each
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
little,
how
did
the
murder
in
georgia
interfere
with
the
sovereignty
of
alabama?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
prosecute
him
for
kidnapping
in
another
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
prosecute
for
murder
in
another
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
real
interest
is,
you
want
a
killing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
has
been
prosecuted
for
murder,
and
he
has
been
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
sentenced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
wasn't
killed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
want
to
kill
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
little,
you
did
argue
earlier
that
one
of
the
interests
of
alabama
was
the
death
penalty.
didn't
you
say
that
standing
where
you
are?
