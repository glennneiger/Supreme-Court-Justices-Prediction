justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
was
there
some
offense
in
alabama?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
allen,
let
me
interrupt
you
again.
suppose
the
alabama
charge
has
been
for
only
kidnapping.
would
you
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
little,
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.
suppose
he
had...
suppose
the
death
penalty
had
been
imposed
in
georgia
but
it
had
been
delayed
for
some
reason.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
alabama
would
have
prosecuted
anyway?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
conceding
that
the
reason
alabama
prosecuted
is
because
he
didn't
get
the
death
penalty
in
georgia?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
your
answer
to
my
other
question
is
probably
in
the
affirmative,
that
you
would
have
prosecuted
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--the
death
penalty--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
fact
is,
you
weren't
satisfied
with
a
life
sentence
in
georgia.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
facts
rather
suggest
it,
don't
they?
would
one
of
alabama's
concerns
be
that
under
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
georgia,
he
might
be
out
on
parole
in
12,
15
years,
and
alabama
wanted
him
in
custody
longer
than
that.
is
that
a
factor
that
would
be
legitimate
for
a
prosecutor?
i
won't...
since
you
don't
know
whether
that
happened
here,
would
that
be
a
legitimate
factor
for
the
prosecutor
in
the
state
of
alabama?
