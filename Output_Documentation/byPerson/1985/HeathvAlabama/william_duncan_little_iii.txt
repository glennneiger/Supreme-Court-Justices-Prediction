mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
petitioner's
argument,
this
is
a
straightforward
case.
there
is
only
one
issue
here,
and
that
is
whether
where
one
act
violates
the
law
of
two
different
governments
or
two
different
sovereign
governments,
there
are
two
different
offenses,
or
whether
double
jeopardy...
excuse
me,
whether
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
applies
to
an
act
which
violates
the
law
of
two
different
states.
as
petitioner
conceded,
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
was
not
raised
in
the
courts
below.
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
alabama
courts
at
all.
it
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
this
court
denied
certiorari
as
to
that
issue
and
granted
certiorari
as
to
an
issue
which
specifically
assumed
the
existence
of
jurisdiction.
now,
this
court's
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
as
it
has
been
established
is
very
clear
and
very
logical.
where
one
act
violates
the
law
of
two
different
sovereign
governments,
there
are
two
different
offenses
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
two
government
are
sovereign
in
relation
to
one
another
where
each
derives
its
authority
to
prosecute
from
a
different
source.
this
court
in
united
states
versus
lanza
and
in
abbate
versus
united
states
has
held
that
states
derive
their
authority
to
prosecute
from
their
own
constitutions.
now,
here
we
have
alabama
and
georgia,
two
states
each
deriving
their
authority
to
prosecute
from
their
own
constitutions.
these
are
sovereigns
under
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine,
and
therefore
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
violation.
furthermore,
this
is
not
only
clear,
it
makes
sense.
in
this
court's
other
double
jeopardy
cases,
the
focus
has
been
on
the
legal
distinction
between
the
statutes,
whether
these
statutes
are
legally
different.
for
instance,
under
blockburger,
the
question
there
is
whether
each
statute
includes
an
element
of
proof
which
is
not
included
in
the
other
statute.
now,
here
we
have
two
laws
which
are
legally
distinct
in
the
most
basic
sense.
one
is
an
alabama
law
passed
by
the
alabama
legislature
pursuant
to
the
alabama
constitution.
the
other
is
a
georgia
law
passed
by
the
georgia
legislature.
they
must
be
considered
different
offenses
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
court
discard
all
the
clear
language
of
these
cases
and
instead
decide
this
case
based
on
other
factors.
i
would
like
to
discuss
these
individually.
first
is
the
idea
of
comparison
of
interest.
petitioner
says
that
two
prosecutions
should
only
be
allowed
where
the
two
governments
are
pursuing
different
interests,
and
where
one
government's
interests
are
not
served
by
another
government.
this
should
be
rejected
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
it
is
totally
contrary
to
what
the
court
has
already
said
in
this
area.
the
focus
in
all
the
dual
sovereignty
cases
is
on
sovereignty,
and
the
focal
question
is,
are
the
governments
sovereign
in
relation
to
one
another.
it
is
very
telling,
i
think,
that
the
petitioner
sites
no
cases
which
interpret
this
court's
cases
as
involving
any
kind
of
comparison
of
interest
test.
furthermore,
in
abbate,
abbate
versus
united
states,
this
court
was
presented
with
a
similar
interest
argument,
and
it
rejected
that
argument.
i
think
the
petitioner's
argument
is
in
essence
that
the
court
simply
didn't
mean
what
it
was
saying
in
these
cases.
furthermore,
if
the
court...
if
the
idea
of
interest
and
a
comparison
of
interest
had
been
the
real
reason
for
deciding
these
cases,
united
states
versus
lanza
would
have
been
decided
differently.
there,
the
petitioner...
excuse
me,
the
defendant
was
prosecuted
in
state
court
for
manufacturing,
transporting,
and
possessing
liquor.
he
pled
guilty.
he
was
then
indicted
in
federal
court
for
manufacturing,
possessing,
and
transporting
exactly
the
same
liquor.
so
therefore
the
interests
in
this
case
were
identical.
the
second
reason
for
rejecting
this
comparison
of
interest
test
is
a
related
one.
because
this
comparison
of
interest
is
contrary
to
the
settled
law
in
this
area,
the
court
could
not
adopt
it
in
the
area
of
prosecution
by
two
different
states
without
casting
serious
doubts
on
its
holdings
in
other
areas.
the
third
reason
for
rejecting
this
comparison
of
interest
test
is
a
more
practical
one.
if
this
test
were
adopted,
the
court
would
be
discarding
a
very
clear
and
a
very
sound
doctrine
in
favor
of
one
that
has
to
be
fleshed
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
now,
in
our
brief,
i
have
demonstrated
the
difficulty
in
applying...
that
often
arises
in
applying
a
test
like
this
to
prosecutions
by
two
different
states,
and
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
has
essentially
admitted
that
that
is
correct.
furthermore,
if
a
comparison
of
interest
test
were
adopted
and
applied
in
this
case,
they
are
different
interests
here.
the
petitioner
pled
guilty,
and
he
received
in
georgia
for
his
georgia
offense
a
life
sentence
with
parole
eligibility.
however,
under
alabama
law
the
punishment
is
different.
under
alabama
law
the
minimum
punishment
is
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
and
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
asked
for
the
death
penalty
given
the
nature
of
the
offense.
so,
alabama
has
unsatisfied
interest.
the
second
factor
in
the
petitioner's
test
is
the
idea
of
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction.
he
points
out
that
in
all
these
dual
sovereignty
cases
courts
happen
to
have
been
exercising
current
territorial
jurisdiction.
this
is
simply
a
different...
a
distinction
without
being
a
difference.
the
focus
of
the
dual
sovereignty...
the
essence
of
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
is
that
where
one
act
violates
the
law
of
two
sovereign
governments,
there
are
two
offenses.
now,
how
those
governments
happen
to
have
obtained
jurisdiction,
whether
it
is
because
there
is
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction
or
because,
as
here,
a
defendant
commits
in
essence
the
continuing
criminal
transaction
across
the
line
of
two
different
states,
is
simply
irrelevant
to
that
analysis.
now,
the
third
factor
in
the
petitioner's
proposed
test
is
the
idea
of
intergovernmental
conflict.
he
says
that
two
prosecutions
should
only
be
allowed
where
there
is
a
substantial
possibility
of
intergovernmental
conflict
in
barring
the
second
prosecution.
again,
like
the
other
two
factors,
this
is
contrary
to
the
explicit
language
of
all
the
dual
sovereignty
cases,
and
the
petitioner
cites
no
case
which
interprets
those
cases
as
involving
that
factor.
moreover,
there
is
easily
as
great
a
possibility
of
intergovernmental
conflict
in
the
area
of
prosecutions
among
the
50
states
as
in
the
area
of
prosecutions
by
the
federal
government
and
indian
tribes,
and
this
court
has
already
held
in
united
states
versus
wheeler
that
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
applies
there.
the
fact
that
these
factors
that
the
petitioner
cites
were
not
the
basis
of
the
court's
decisions
as
shown
by
the
case
of
waller
versus
florida.
in
that
case
we
had
different
interests.
the
person
was
prosecuted
in
municipal
court
for
misdemeanors.
he
was
then
prosecuted
in
state
court
for
a
felony.
so
there
was
a
difference
in
the
punishment,
a
significant
difference.
there
was
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
intergovernmental
conflict
and
prosecutions
involving
municipalities
and
states.
for
instance,
every
vehicular
homicide
which
occurs
within
city
limits
is
potentially
a
violation
of
a
municipal
traffic
ordinance
and
a
state
homicide
statute,
and
it
is
certainly
possible
the
defendant
can
go
into
municipal
court
and
plead
guilty
and
then
try
to
use
that
to
defeat
or
to
avoid
a
state
homicide
prosecution.
in
short,
this
court's
dual
sovereignty
cases
are
very
concise
and
very
logical,
and
above
all
very
workable.
by
contrast,
the
petitioner's
proposed
test
is
not
only
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
this
area--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--your
honor,
under
alabama
law
the
offense
that
the
petitioner
was
accused
of
and
was
prosecuted
for
is
murder
during
a
kidnapping
in
the
first
degree.
alabama
courts
have
interpreted
that
as
being--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--not
if
that
kidnapping--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--under
alabama
law,
alabama
has
jurisdiction
of
an
offense
if
it
began
in
alabama
and
ended
in
another
state.
alabama
has
interpreted
our
capital
murder
offense
of
murder
during
a
kidnapping
as
being
one
offense
consisting
of
two
different
elements,
so
it
began
in
alabama
and
ended
in
another
state.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
our
real
interest,
your
honor,
is
in
prosecuting
him
for
violating
our
law.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
he
has
been
prosecuted
in
georgia
for
georgia's
offense
of
murder.
now,
what
georgia--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--and
he
has
been
convicted.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
and
sentenced.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
well,
what
georgia--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--what
georgia
does
with
respect
to
its
offenses
is
simply
not
our
business.
we
would
prosecute
him
regardless
of
whether
georgia
did
or
did
not.
now,
there
are
several
matters
that
mr.
allen
touched
on
that
i
would
like
to
just
very
briefly
discussed.
he
asserted
that
this
is
a
joint
investigation
in
this
case.
the
record
shows
that
it
was
not.
these
were
two
different
states
independently
investigating
this
crime.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
well,
your
honor,
we
prosecuted
him.
the
explicit
reason
for
prosecuting
him
in
this
case
stated
by
the
prosecutor
in
his
closing
argument
was
that
he
had
violated
alabama
law.
he
was
subject
to
the
prosecution.
i
was
not
the
prosecutor
in
that
case,
and
i
cannot
personally
say
what
would
have
happened
if
there
had
been
a
death
sentence
imposed
in
georgia.
but
the
fact
that
there
was
a
death
sentence
imposed
in
georgia
would
no
affect
the
fact
that
this
man
had
committed
an
alabama
offense
for
which
he
was
subject
to
be
prosecuted.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
no,
i
am
certainly
not,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
well,
he
would
have--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--well,
all
i
can
say
is,
i
don't
know.
what
i
am
going
by
is
what
the
prosecutor
stated
in
the
record.
the
man
would
have
violated
alabama
law
regardless
of
whether
he
had
gotten
a
death
sentence
in
georgia.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
certainly.
if
the
defendant
had
gotten
a
death
sentence
in
georgia
and
it
appeared
that
that
death
sentence
would
stand
up,
a
prosecutor
might
in
his
discretion
decide
that
he
simply
had
better
things
to
do
than
to
prosecute
a
case
and
impose
another
death
sentence.
after
all,
a
person
can
only
be
executed
one
time.
but
that--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
that
might
be
a
factor
for
a
prosecutor
exercising
his
discretion,
and
whether
to
prosecute
in
a
particular
case,
he
might
take
that
into
consideration.
whether
he
did
that
in
this
case,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
maybe
i
could
clarify
my
position.
alabama
has--
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
--yes,
i
did,
but
let
me
clarify
what
i
meant
if
i
didn't
say
it
correctly.
alabama
basically
has
two
interests.
alabama
has
declared
that
when
a
person
is
kidnapped
from
alabama
and
murdered,
that
is
a
capital
offense
in
alabama,
regardless
of
whether
that
violates
the
law
of
another
state
or
whether
another
state
prosecutes.
we
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
a
person
is
prosecuted
and
sentenced
according
to
alabama
law
for
that
alabama
offense.
now,
if
you
want
to
simply
boil
the
case
down
to
a
matter
of
interest,
and
if
you
can
assume
that
the
punishment
or
the
proceedings
in
another
state
can
satisfy
alabama's
interest
under
its
law,
then
alabama
does
have
an
unsatisfied
interest
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
minimum
punishment,
the
punishment
he
received
in
georgia
is
less
than
what
he...
the
minimum
punishment
he
would
have
received
in
alabama,
and
a
prosecutor
certainly
could
take
that
into
consideration.
one
other
factor
i
would
like
to
clear
up,
mr.
allen
has
asserted
that
the
record
is
not
clear
that
mr.
heath
pled
guilty
in
exchange
for
a
life
sentence.
i
am
not
really
sure
i
understand
his
argument
with
regard
to
that,
but
mr.
heath
himself
testified,
i
believe,
that
he
pled
guilty
in
georgia
in
exchange
for
a
life
sentence.
so
he
is
the
one
who
discussed
the
bargain
there.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
in
my
understanding,
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole
in
seven
years
in
georgia.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
in
seven
years.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
as
i
understand.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
so,
your
honor,
alabama
in
exercising
its
discretion
to
prosecute
certainly
could
take
that
into
account.
as
to...
this
is
not
an
important
point,
but
i
would
like
to
assert
the
record
is
not
clear
where
the
murder
in
this
case
took
place.
what
we
know
about
this
case
is
that
this
woman
was
forcibly
abducted
from
alabama
and
that
her
body
was
later
found
in
georgia.
as
to
when...
now,
the
record
probably
suggests
that
she
died
in
georgia,
but
as
to
where
she
was
shot,
we
simply
don't
know.
as
to
the
assertion
that
the
petitioner
was
prosecuted
because
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
in
georgia
or
asserted
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
other
than
the
coincidence
of
dates.
it
is
pretty
clear
what
happened
here.
this
man
was
charge
in
georgia.
alabama
simply
sat
back
and
let
georgia
proceed
against
them
until
georgia
was
through
with
him.
there
were
a
number
of
trials
taking
place
in
his
co-defendants
around
this
time,
and
it
was
simply
convenient
for
alabama
to
wait
until
georgia
was
through
with
mr.
heath
for
whatever
purposes
before
they
tried
to
extradite
him
back.
now,
with
regard
to
the
case
of
nielson
versus
oregon,
what
that
is,
in
that
case
there
is
some
dicta
which
suggest
that
when
one
state,
when
two
states
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
an
area,
and
where
one
state
proceeds
against
a
defendant
for
violation
of
its
laws,
where
the
other
state
also
prohibits
that
laws,
it
then
loses
its
jurisdiction.
now,
to
the
extent
that
that
is
good
law
still,
that
holding
or
that
dicta
only
relates
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
case
at
all.
mr.
william
duncan
little,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
in
this
case
has
a
very
clearcut
task,
to
apply
a
settled
doctrine
to
another
area.
i
think
it
is
clear
the
situation
here...
that
the
situation
here
falls
within
the
established
dual
sovereignty
doctrine,
and
therefore
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you.
