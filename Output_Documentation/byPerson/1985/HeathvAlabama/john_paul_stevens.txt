justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you
there,
because
i
have
been
trying
to
reflect
about
your
multiple,
whether
that
makes
it
better
or
worse.
supposing
somebody
starts
out
in
chicago
and
drives
100
miles
an
hour
all
the
way
up
through
indiana
into
michigan.
can
he
be
prosecuted
for
speeding
in
all
three
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
he
forces
someone
against
his
will
to
ride
with
him.
can
he
be
prosecuted
for
kidnapping
in
all
three
states
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--planning
to
kill
him
when
picks
him
up
in
chicago
and
dumps
him
off
in
st.
joe
when
he
does
kill
him,
he
can
only
be
prosecuted
in
one
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
each
trial
you
would
want
to
prove
the
whole
sequence
of
events,
i
am
assuming.
you
decided
to
do
it,
you
picked
him
up...
i
mean,
if
the
prosecutor...
you
picked
him
up,
drove
him
on
this
particular
route,
and
then
killed
him
and
dumped
him
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
quite
right?
didn't
one
of
them
permit
it
and
the
other
prohibit
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
had
two
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
by
hypothesis
they
were
dealing
with
an
act
that
took
place
in
a
territory
over
which
both
had
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allen,
i
want
to
be
sure,
because
i
wasn't
sure
i
understood
one
of
your
answers
to
justice
white.
do
you
view...
is
it
critical
to
your
argument
that
this
be
a
capital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
it
were
just...
if
it
were
a
non-capital
offense,
you
would
basically
make
the
same
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
assume...
we
have
been
talking
mostly
about
cases
where
there
is
some
difference
in
the
law,
one,
there
is
a
death
penalty
that
is
imposed,
and
the
other
there
isn't.
supposing
we
had
a
non-capital
offense
for
a
moment.
supposing
the
law
of
each
state
prescribed
a
mandatory
ten-year
sentence,
no
deviation
up
or
down,
and
the
same
elements
of
the
offense
in
both,
but
it
had
some
kind
of
an
interstate
quirk,
as
this
one
does,
and
they
prosecuted,
sentence
him
to
ten
years,
and
he
is
serving
his
ten
years.
on
your
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
could
your
state
go
ahead
and
prosecute
him
again
for
the
same
offense
and
impose
an
additional
ten
years
so
he
would
get
a
total
of
20?
