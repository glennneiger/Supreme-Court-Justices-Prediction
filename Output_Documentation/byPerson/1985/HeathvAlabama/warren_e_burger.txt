we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
heath
against
alabama.
mr.
allen,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say,
mr.
allen,
if
the
record
showed
that
there
was
a
kidnapping
and
rape
in
one
state,
either
georgia
or
alabama,
and
then
another
day
the
murder
occurred?
what
would
you...
would
your
view
be
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
kidnapping
and
rape
in,
say--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
taking
them
across
the
state
line
and
murdering
the
victim
on
the
next
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
georgia,
when
would
he
be
eligible
for
parole,
if
ever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seven
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
assert,
i
take
it,
that
alabama
or
any
other
state
so
involved
has
the
right
to
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
to
prosecute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
allen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
is
an
invalid
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
agree
that
this
man
would
be
eligible
for
parole
in
seven
years
under
georgia
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
average
length
of
life
sentence
is
15
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
higher
than
the
national
average
by
far.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
georgia's
statute
that
we
dealt...
new
criminal
code
that
we
dealt
with
a
few
years
ago
was
apparently
one
of
the
most
generous
in
terms
of
short
sentences
of
any
in
the
country.
those
two
things
don't
add
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
