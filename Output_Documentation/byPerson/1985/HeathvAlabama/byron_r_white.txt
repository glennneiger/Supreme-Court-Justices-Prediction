justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
independent
argument
of
your
double
jeopardy--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
jurisdictional
thing?
is
that
just
a...
is
that
a
due
process
claim,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
double
jeopardy
argument
is
really
a
due
process
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
allen,
suppose
the
alabama
statute
or
the
criminal
statute
said...
named
as
one
of
the
capital
crimes
a
kidnapping
in
the
course
of
which
a
murder
takes
place,
and
so
they
indict
him
for
kidnapping,
and
they
prove
that
a
murder
took
place.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
you
could
use...
you
could
use
in
the
sentencing
phase
evidence
of
crimes
that
took
place
in
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
be...
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
jurisdiction,
then,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
arguing
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
arguing
something--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
cut
his
throat
and
he
bled
to
death
in
two
states,
i
suppose
you
could
prosecute
in
both
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
have
been
the
purpose,
but
what
would
you
say
in
that
case,
only
one
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose...
you
are
not...
your
argument
up
here
isn't
the
jurisdictional
one.
you
say
you
aren't
entitled
to
make
it.
well,
you
say
you
are,
but
it
wasn't
raised
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
from
the
state
court,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
what
if...
what
if
this
weren't
a
capital...
weren't
a
capital
case,
and
the
act
he
committed
in
georgia
in
the
course
of
a
kidnapping
or
in
the
course
of
something
of
a
continuing
crime
wasn't
a
crime
there.
now,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
alabama
then
couldn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know,
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
wouldn't
be
making
a
double
jeopardy
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
making
a
jurisdictional
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
not...
so
your
argument
you
made,
your
fundamental
argument
here
wouldn't
apply
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
your
double
jeopardy
argument
wouldn't
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
talk
about
my
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
that
is
all
i
need
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
may...
i
suppose
you
insist
that
alabama
would
have
had
the
power
to
do
it,
but
may
not
have
exercised
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
allen,
suppose
that
georgia
had
arrested
this...
alabama
had
arrested
this
man
first.
he
ran
to
alabama
and
they
indicted
him
for
murder,
a
murder
that
took
place
in
georgia
but
in
the
course
of
a
kidnapping.
then
you
would
be
reduced
to
the
jurisdictional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
could
georgia
have
prosecuted
him
for
murder?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
