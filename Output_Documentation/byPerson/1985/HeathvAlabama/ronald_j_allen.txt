mr.
ronald
j.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
heath
was
indicted
in
georgia
for
the
murder
of
his
wife
after
joint
investigation
between
alabama
and
georgia
officials
for
capital
murder.
the
same
day
that
he
was
indicted,
a
notice
of
aggravating
circumstance
was
filed
by
the
state,
which
is
the
method
by
which
georgia
indicates
its
intent
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
some
time
later,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
that
murder,
and
we
now
reach
a
factual
nuance
that
will
take
me
a
minute
or
so
to
explore
of
some
significance.
in
the
state's
brief
they
assert
in
pages
10,
31,
and
32
that
the
defendant
pled
guilty
to
life
imprisonment.
that
is
not
supported
by
the
record,
and
if
it
is
supported
by
the
record,
it
causes
the
state
a
bit
of
a
dilemma.
the
record
shows
that
he
pled
guilty
to
murder,
and
then
it
is
uncontradicted
that
he
went
through
what
is
called
the
unified
appeals
procedure,
which
is
the
method
by
which
georgia...
these
are
hearings
by
which
they
decide
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
imposed,
and
subsequently
a
life
sentence
was
imposed.
i
think
the
reason
the
state
asserts
that
he
pled
guilty
to
the
life
sentence
is
they
indicate
or
at
least
argue
that
he
was
never
in
jeopardy
for
his
life,
whereas
in
fact
the
record
supports
that
he
was,
but
more
importantly,
suppose
the
government
is
right.
suppose
the
state
of
alabama
is
correct
that
he
did
plead
guilty
to
life
imprisonment.
under
those
circumstances,
the
dilemma
that
the
state
faces
is
either
that
they
are
essentially
conceding
that
their
agents
denied
a
trial,
that
there
was
a
plea
agreement,
committed
perjury,
or
if
it
was
somebody
other
than
those
agents
who
entered
into
the
plea
agreement,
serious
questions
of
immunity
are
raised,
because
obviously
if
there
was
an
agreement
in
georgia,
it
would
contain,
at
least
implicitly,
statements
about
immunity,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
one
of
the
issues
that
this
court
would
face
should
it
apply
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
to
successive
state
prosecutions
is
how
to
work
out
those
kinds
of
questions
of
immunity.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
am
sorry,
sir.
you
mean
across
a
state
line?
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
say,
georgia?
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
think
it
is
quite
clear,
your
honor,
for
reasons
i
am
going
to
develop
in
detail,
that
we
have
to
respect
territoriality
in
the
criminal
justice
process,
and
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
murder
occurred
in
the
one
state,
the
kidnapping
and
the
rape
occurred
in
another.
now,
if
one
of
those
acts
is
not
an
element
of
an
offense,
and
is
relevant
somehow
to
the
sentencing
process,
then
it
strikes
me
that
the
territoriality
principle
would
not
restrict
the
state
from
considering
that
element
in
its
decision
to
reach
a
conclusion
of
capital
punishment.
the
interesting
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
sentencing
criteria
in
this
case
is
the
kidnapping.
the
sine
qua
non
is
the
murder,
and
that
occurred
in
georgia,
not
in
alabama.
now,
this
court
asked
the
parties
to
address
the
applicability
of
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
to
successive
state
prosecutions.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
if...
was
there
some
offense?
if
there
was
a
kidnapping,
there
was
a
kidnapping
most
likely
in
alabama.
the
record
isn't
absolutely
clear
about
that,
to
be
quite
frank
about
it,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--those
things
were
entered
into
in
georgia.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
that's
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
three
issues.
first
of
all,
the
concerns
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
are
more
acute
here
than
in
any
other
situation
where
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine,
the
concerns
of
the
individual.
commensurately,
the
concerns
of
the
state
are
less.
secondly,
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
alabama
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states,
and
further
will
call
into
question--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--no,
sir.
and
further,
as
i
was
saying,
would
call
into
question...
a
decision
in
favor
of
alabama
would
call
into
question
precedents
of
this
court.
the
third
point
that
i
will
make
today
is
that
by
contrast
a
decision
for
mr.
heath
would
essentially
cast
doubt
on
no
precedents
of
this
court
and
maintain
the
status
quo
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states.
the
reason
the
defendant's
interests
are
more
acute
here
than
in
other
circumstances
where
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
is,
first
of
all,
here
we
have
what
is
probably
the
pristine
problem
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
apparently
repeated
efforts
to
deprive
a
person
of
his
life.
in
most
instances
where
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
has
been
applied,
that
is
not
the
case,
and
of
course
that
raises
an
increased
risk
of
an
erroneous
death
sentence
that
has
not
been
dealt
with
before
by
this
court,
but
more
importantly
than
that,
a
second
reason
why
the
defendant's
interests
are
more
acute
here
is
that
the
state
purports
to
ask
you
to
extend
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
successive
state
prosecutions.
but
that
is
not
what
they
are
asking
you
to
do.
what
they
are
asking
you
to
do
is
in
fact
create
a
multiple
sovereignty
exception.
under
the
state's
argument,
the
fact
that
there
are
only
two
states
involved
in
this
case
is
a
complete
fortuity.
if
states
are
allowed
to
be
freed
from
the
constraints
of
double
jeopardy
clause
when
a
sister
state
has
taken
cognizance
of
that
exact
same
act,
the
result
could
be
that
an
individual
could
be
tried
for
the
same
offense
across
a
multitude
of
states.
a
perfect
example
is,
if
a
person
is
kidnapped,
to
pick
up
some
of
the
examples
already
used
today
and
carry
it
across
three
different
jurisdictions,
each
of
those
jurisdictions
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
kidnapping,
and
presumably
if
there
is
a
murder
that
follows,
to
try
that
individual
for
the
capital
offense
of
the
murder.
so,
we
are
talking
here
not
about
a
dual
sovereignty
exception.
we
are
talking
about
creating
a
multiple
sovereignty
exception.
moreover,
the
interests
of
the
state
in
this
situation
are
much
less
than
they
are
in
the
other
context
where
this
court
has
extended
the
dual
sovereignty
exception.
it
is
conceivable
the
next
15
minutes
of
my
life
may
be
made
uncomfortable
by
pointed
questions
that
implicitly
ask
if
the
states
are
sovereign.
well,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
yes,
indeed,
the
states
are
sovereign.
i
am
not
here
to
attack
the
sovereignty
of
the
states.
but
to
say
that
they
are
sovereign
is
not
to
say
what
the
attributes
of
sovereignty
are.
and
as
this
court
held...
or
discussed,
did
not
hold,
in
garcia
last
year,
one
has
to
look
at
the
interest
underlying
institutional
relationships
in
interpreting
the
nature
of
sovereignty.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
an
appropriate
way
to
proceed
as
this
court
has
proceeded
in
the
past
in
interpretations
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
if
you
look
at
your
decisions,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
when
four
conditions
have
been
met,
you
have
applied
the
dual
sovereignty
exceptions
to
successive
prosecution.
number
one,
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction.
number
two,
by
quite
different
entities,
governmental
entities
that
pursue
quite
different
interests.
number
three,
where
there
is
a
risk
of
intergovernmental
conflict.
and
four,
where
the
most
felicitous
resolution
of
that
conflict
is
to
allow
two,
not
a
multitude,
but
two
prosecutions.
none
of
these
matters
are
present
here
in
this
case.
there
obviously
is
not,
at
least
i
think
there
is
not
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction.
without
that,
there
is
not
the
overlapping
of
complex
statutory
structures
that
exist,
say,
in
the
federal-state
relationships,
and
with
that
overlapping
of
the
federal
and
state
statutes
comes
the
possibility
of
continuous
and
annoying
friction.
that
doesn't
exist
in
the
relationship
of
states
to
each
other
as
it
does
in
successive
federal
state
prosecutions.
moreover,
in
the
context
of
resolving
this
problem
in
the
federal-state
context,
consider
the
alternatives
that
this
court
faced
when
asked
to
do
just
that.
if
you
allow,
as
you
could
have
done,
the
first
prosecution
to
preempt
the
second,
under
those
circumstances,
a
state
prosecution
would
preempt
a
subsequent
federal
prosecution
with
the
resultant
loss
of
federal
supremacy,
obviously
not
a
desired
result.
the
reverse,
though,
is
no
more
desirable.
if
it
is
a
federal
prosecution
that
preempts
a
state
prosecution,
the
result
of
that
is
federal
preemption
of
local
law
enforcement,
again,
not
desirable,
but
again,
neither
one
would
occur
in
this
case.
in
fact,
if
there
is
any
loss
of
sovereignty
in
this
case,
it
would
come
by
affirming
alabama's
taking
of
jurisdiction
over
these
events
that
occurred
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
in
georgia,
and
allowing
them
to
execute
a
person
for
a
murder
that
occurred
within
that
state.
now,
another--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--your
honor,
let
me
just
be
frank
about
the
matter.
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
that
jurisdiction
is
before
this
court.
the
difficulty
is,
it
was
not
raised
by
counsel
for
mr.
heath
below.
i
think
that
nonetheless
it
is
before
this
court
for
the
following
reason.
your
cases
have
always
said
that
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
applies
only
when
both
jurisdictions
have
jurisdiction.
therefore
your
cases
make
an
element
of
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
the
presence
of
jurisdiction
over
the
event.
that
is
the
reason
if
it
is
before
you
it
is
before
you.
now,
let
me
also
say,
though,
that
even
if
you
decide
jurisdiction
is
not
appropriately
before
you,
the
consequences
of
this
court
finding
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
apply
to
successive
state
prosecution
in
terms
of
what
that
implies
about
state
jurisdiction
obviously
is
a
concern
that
this
court
should
have.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
in
any
event
it
is,
you
are
right,
and--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--i
would
be
quite
happy
to
be
free
to
think
that
all
due
process
issues
are
properly
before
you,
but
something
tells
me
i
shouldn't
view
it
that
way.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
your
honor,
they
have
a
statute
that
says
that
a
crime
that
commences
in
alabama
they
have
jurisdiction
of,
even
if
it
is
consummated
outside
the
state.
they
say
that
this
crime
of
the
murder
commenced
with
the
kidnapping,
which
occurred,
if
it
occurred
at
all,
in
alabama,
and
therefore
they
say
this
is
a
single
crime,
murder
during
a
kidnapping,
and
they
have
jurisdiction
over
it.
do
you
want
me
to
go
further,
because
i
can.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
yes,
sir,
that
is
a
problem.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
that's
the
problem.
now,
the
state...
the
third
reason
why
the
state's
interest
in
this
case
is
even
less
than
in
the
normal
context
of
dual
sovereignty
is
that
in
the
normal
context
of
dual
sovereignty,
the
federal-state
context
in
particular,
you
have
different
entities
pursuing
different
interests.
here
that
is
not
the
case.
this
particular
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
it.
you
have
both
states
pursuing
their
interests
in
deterring
and
punishing
murders.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
yes,
sir,
she
was.
the
issue
that
raises
is
a
very
interesting
one,
which
is
whether
or
not
a
state...
unfortunately,
its
jurisdiction...
has
the
power
to
protect
its
citizens
outside
of
its
state
borders.
even
if
they
do,
and
let's
assume
that
they
do,
nonetheless,
they
don't
have
the
power
to
do
that
freed
from
your
interpretation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
so
you
would
have
to
find
that
not
only
does
alabama
have
the
power
to
exert
jurisdiction
on
this
basis,
but
also
that
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
is
going
to
be
extended,
because
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
georgia
did
exert
authority
over
this
murder.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
yes,
sir,
the
opinions
of
your
own
court
suggest
that
very
strongly.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
huntington
versus
attrill
says
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--quite
some
time
ago,
in
the
1800's.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
it
is
my
understanding
that
international
shoe
was
not
an
interpretation
of
criminal
jurisdiction
rules.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
your
honor,
you
are
right
that
we
are
not.
if
you
are
asserting
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--and
the
answer
is
that
those
cases
are
old
cases,
but
the
reason
they
are
old
cases
is
because
the
principal
of
territoriality
that
they
constructed,
or
i
shouldn't
say
constructed,
simply
recognized,
has
never
been
cast
into
doubt.
a
perfect
example
of
this
is,
after
diligent
search
i
and
i
presume
my
friend
from
alabama
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
case
other
than
this
case
of
an
extraterritorial
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
a
murder
that
occurred
outside
the
state.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
if
there
is
a
reason,
the
reason
is,
is
that
one
has
always
interpreted
the
criminal
process,
the
statutes
constructing
the
criminal
process
in
a
narrow
way.
here,
if
you
allow
the
kinds
of...
if
you
allow
an
analogy
to
civil
jurisdiction,
what
you
would
get,
of
course,
is
that
the
states
are
completely
free
to
interpret
their
own
interests,
bring
people
in
for
very
serious
charges,
even
though
they
may
have
occurred
anywhere
across
the
country,
or
indeed
for
that
matter
anywhere
in
the
world
in
a
context
where
normally
we
view
that
as
inappropriate
behavior.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
well,
it
depends,
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this,
because
your
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
one
of
the
problems
we
have.
if
you
construe
criminal
jurisdiction
to
be
limited
to
territoriality,
the
question
would
be
answered
in
the
negative.
they
could
not
exert
jurisdiction,
and
obviously
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
that
is
not
what
my
argument
rests
upon.
that
is
one
implication
of
a
decision
in
favor
of
alabama,
that
they
do
have
extraterritorial
jurisdiction,
notwithstanding
the
pronouncements
of
this
court.
the
argument
here,
though,
is,
assuming
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction,
georgia
did
exercise
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
and
the
question
is,
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
preclude
alabama
from
doing
so
when
georgia
has
already
done
so.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
have
an
unequivocal
answer
to
your
question,
although
it
would
be
a
dramatic
change
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
to
hold
that
criminal
justice
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
over
criminal
acts
is
somehow
analogous
to
civil
jurisdiction,
and
indeed,
as
i
say,
the
absence
of
these
cases
indicates
how
dramatic
a
change
that
would
be.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
where
does
the
murder
occur?
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
because--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
is
the
conventional
view
of
the
interpretations
of
this
court
that
the
only
crime,
although
it
is
not
clear,
but
the
only
crime
for
which
capital
punishment
is
permissible
is
murder.
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
quite
obvious
the
state
would
be
trying
to
circumvent
those
restrictions.
call
it
kidnapping,
convict
him,
and
then
rely
on
what
is
the
sine
qua
non,
which
is
the
murder,
which
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
state's
jurisdiction.
but
even
in
your
case--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--but
even
in
your
case,
your
honor,
let
me
point
out--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--no,
i
would
be
arguing--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--i
would
be
arguing
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
which,
justice
white,
if
i
had
had
my
druthers,
would
also
have
been
raised
below,
but
wasn't.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
your
hypothetical
you
leave
one
fact
out
that
does
not
make
it
analogous
to
this
case,
which
is
that
in
this
case
georgia
did
take
cognizance
of
the
murder
that
occurred
in
georgia,
did
prosecute,
did
give
a
life
sentence
to
mr.
heath.
for
these
reasons,
it
strikes
me
that
the
balance
is
here
altogether
different.
the
interests
of
the
defendant
are
much
stronger.
the
interests
of
the
state
are
much
weaker
than
in
other
cases
where
this
court
has
interpreted
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
be
applicable.
i
might
point
out
two
other
points.
if
you
decide
in
favor
of
alabama,
that
will
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
have
already
pointed
out
one
way
in
which
that
is
so.
this
would
be
the
creation
not
of
a
dual
sovereignty
exception,
but
of
a
multiple
sovereignty
exception.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
think
he
can,
your
honor.
there
decide
what
jurisdictional
rules
apply.
you
are
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
acts
that
occurred
in
the
state.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
yes.
there
was
a
kidnapping
that
occurred--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
where
the
events
occurred.
if
that
is
not
true--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
except
in
the
state
in
which
the
murder
occurred.
if
that
is
not
part
and
parcel
of
the
charge,
i
don't
know
why
it
would
be
relevant.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
right.
if
you
kill
him
in
each
state,
then
i
would
agree
you
could
prosecute
him
in
each
state.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
that
is
a
good...
that
is
a
good
hypothetical,
really,
and
in
fact
it
is
a
hypothetical
that
common
law
has
dealt
with.
common
law
says
there
are
two
alternative
grounds
of
jurisdiction
over
murder,
either
where
the
blow
occurs,
in
this
case
the
cutting
of
the
throat,
or
where
the
person
expires.
but
that
wasn't
for
purposes
of
allowing
two
states
to
have
jurisdiction.
that
was
for
the
purposes
of
locating
the
offense
somewhere.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
only
one
state,
and--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--either.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
but
not
two.
now,
if
i
may
go
on
with
the
implications
of
a
decision
in
favor
of
alabama,
not
only
is
there
the
multiple
sovereignty
problem,
there
is
also
going
to
be
an
impact
on
plea
bargaining.
the
only
reason
why
a
defendant
pleads
is
to
get
assurances
on
sentence,
and
the
more
that
that
person
is
exposed
to
multiple
prosecutions,
the
less
likely
that
person
is
going
to
be
to
cooperate,
or
at
least
it
is
true
the
more
difficult
those
negotiations
are
going
to
become.
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
if
the
state
is
correct
in
its
implications
that
there
was...
well,
if
the
brief
is
correct,
if
respondent's
brief
is
correct
in
its
implications
that
there
was
a
deal,
this
statement
that
was
given,
which
is
virtually
the
only
evidence
that
ties
him
to
the
offense
obviously
was
given
in
response
to
that
deal.
now,
it
is
highly,
highly
unlikely
that
that
individual
is
going
to
give
that
statement
that
then
was
used
against
him
in
alabama
if
he
is
exposed
to
the
prosecution
in
alabama
that
actually
occurred
in
this
case.
so
again
i
think
one
thing
that
you
ought
to
think
about
or
might
want
to
think
about
is
the
impact
of
exposing
an
individual
to
multiple
trials
on
plea
bargaining.
moreover,
a
decision
in
favor
of
alabama
raises
serious
questions
for
this
court,
or
will
raise
serious
questions
for
this
court
in
other
areas.
how
do
the
vindictiveness
cases
apply,
or
will
the
apply
to
successive
activities
by
state
prosecutors
in
different
states?
the
state
suggests
that
our
suggestion
in
our
brief
that
in
part
the
alabama
prosecution
was
a
function
of
mr.
heath's
refusing
to
testify
in
georgia
is
preposterous.
i
would
like
to
review
just
quickly
what
happened.
he
was
called
to
testify
against
his
confederates,
who
he
identified,
by
the
way,
in
the
statement
made
to
the
police
in
georgia,
and
he
pled
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
still
subject
to
a
kidnapping
charge
in
alabama,
which
he
was,
and
it
was
clearly
a
legitimate
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
one
week
to
the
day
after
he
pled
the
fifth
amendment,
alabama
empaneled
a
grand
jury
and
indicted
him
for
not
the
kidnapping
but
the
murder.
now,
it
strikes
me
that
under
the
precedents
of
this
court,
figpen
versus
roberts,
blackledge
versus
perry,
and
the
like,
that
would
clearly
raise
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness,
and
the
issue
that
you
will
face
if
you
apply
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
successive
state
prosecutions
is
precisely
that
kind
of
an
issue
that
will
now
come
back
to
you.
how
does
immunity
work?
i
mentioned
before
that
we
have
here
a
problem
of
immunity.
if
there
was
a
deal,
that
deal
implicitly
contains
an
agreement
not
to
prosecute
for
other
offenses.
under
your
precedence,
the
state,
if
a
state
grants
immunity,
at
least
use
and
derivative
use,
that
binds
the
federal
government.
if
you
apply
the
successive
state
to...
the
dual
sovereignty
exception
to
successive
state
prosecutions,
you
will
have
the
same
kind
of
immunity
problems
in
successive
state
prosecutions.
at
least
it
will
have
to
be
worked
out.
moreover,
if
you
allow
successive
state
prosecutions,
you
will
eventually
have
to
decide
the
scope
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
you
will
get
cases
with
less
and
less
of
a
nexus
to
states,
and
you
will
have
to
work
that
problem
out.
now,
perhaps
you
can
work
it
out
by
an
easy
reference
to
pennoyer
versus
neff.
it
is
possible.
i
suggest
that
that
is
quite
inconsistent
with
our
understanding
of
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
single
most
important
element
is
territoriality.
if
you
affirm
this
opinion,
affirm
this
case
in
a
way
that
implies
that
criminal
jurisdiction
is
freed
from
territoriality
as
a
primary
determinant,
you
will
then
have
to
fill
the
void
with
something
else,
and
this
court
will
be
the
court,
or
the
lower
federal
courts
will
be
the
courts
that
will
have
to
answer
those
questions.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
case
is
unprecedented
in
certain
other
ways.
as
i
have
said
before,
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
can
find,
and
the
state
has
not
cited
any
either,
where
there
has
been
an
extraterritorial
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
a
murder
that
occurred
somewhere
else.
there
have
been
two
cases
that
have
reached
courts
of
last
resort
where
there
are
multiple
prosecutions
and
a
federal-state
dual
sovereignty
exception
for
the
same
prosecution,
and
in
both
cases
the
courts
of
last
resort
reversed.
that
was
the
gay
case
in
michigan
and
your
case
in
coleman
versus
tennessee.
i
have
found
one
case
since
the
time
we
wrote
our
brief
where
multiple
prosecutions
for
the
same
murder
have
been
upheld,
and
that
is
delay
versus
the
united
states,
602
fed
2nd
173
of
the
eighth
circuit.
its
singularity,
though,
i
think,
speaks
volumes
about
the
view
of
the
scope
of
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
abhorrence
that
we
have
for
multiple
prosecutions
for
the
same--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--delay,
d-e-l-a-y,
versus
united
states,
602
fed
2nd
173.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
yes.
eighth
circuit,
1979,
i
believe.
two
other
points
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
if
you
decide
in
favor
of
alabama,
you
will
cast
in
doubt
directly
one
of
the
precedents
of
your
court,
nielson
versus
oregon.
in
nielson
versus
oregon,
you
held
that
where
oregon
and
washington
have
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction
because
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
admitted
to
the
union...
they
have
territorial
jurisdiction
over
the
same
river.
i
shouldn't
say
you
held.
you
said
that
when
a
state,
when
two
states
have
concurrent
territorial
jurisdiction,
and
one
state
takes
jurisdiction
over
a
criminal
offense
that
occurred
within
that
concurrent
area,
the
other
state
is
forbidden
from
doing
so.
now,
again,
you
may
wish--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--well,
you
are
right.
i
was
talking
about--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--i
was
talking
about
your
dicta.
in
dicta,
the
court
said
that
if
this
were
the
case,
but
actually
what
happened
in
nielson
is
that
one
state
explicitly
allowed
by
statute
the
occurrence,
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
sufficient
to
negate
the
otherwise
legitimate
statute
of
the
state
of
washington,
i
believe,
and
it
was
not.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
right,
and
of
course
that
is
an
a
fortiori
case
from
this
case,
because
here
i
take
it
we
have
not
reached
the
point
where
alabama
has
jurisdiction
over
georgia.
on
the
other
hand,
a
decision
for
mr.
heath
will
be
of
very
limited
effect.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
capital
case
where,
as
i
said
earlier,
he
was
put
into
jeopardy
in
his
life
in
two
states,
and
indeed
it
involves
the
single
most
important
interest
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
it
is
not
critical,
no.
it
is
interesting,
but
it
is
not
critical.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
that's
right.
this
court,
as
you
know,
has
carved
out
capital
sentences
as
a
thing
apart
in
many
instances,
estelle
versus
smith
and
all
the...
and
you
could
do
that
again.
i
have
just
pointed
out
how
limited
the
decision
could
be
in
favor
of
mr.
heath,
and
indeed
there
is
a
reason
to
do
that,
and
that
is
that
again
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
specifically
about
putting
somebody
in
jeopardy
for
their
life.
secondly,
a
decision
in
favor
of
mr.
heath
overrules
and
casts
into
doubt
no
cases.
thirdly,
it
preserves
rather
than
disrupts
the
status
quo
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states,
and
no
disruptive
questions
that
i
can
see
will
come
from
a
decision
in
favor
of
mr.
heath.
so,
in
conclusion,
what
i
would
say
is
that
alabama
is
attempting
essentially
to
circumvent
two
fundamental
limits
on
state
power.
one
is
that
we
normally
subject
a
person
to
a
single
trial
for
single
offense,
and
of
course
the
other
is
that
the
reach
of
the
state's
penal
law
is
normally
limited
to
territoriality.
they
have
offered
no
good
reason
why
they
should
be
allowed
to
escape
these
limits
on
their
power,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
they
have
not
been
able
to
do
so.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
right.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
alabama's
role
to
police
the
acts
that
occur
in
other
states.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
if
the
answer
is
yes,
i
would
be
making
a
single
argument.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
not
a
double
jeopardy
argument.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
jurisdictional
argument.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
no,
that
is
not
true.
even
if
georgia
has--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--not
in
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--not
in
that
case,
but
that
is
not
this
case,
because
georgia
did
take
cognizance
of
this
particular--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--absolutely.
if
georgia
did
not
take
cognizance
of
some
act,
it
would
not
be
a
double
jeopardy
argument.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
a
few
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
no,
i
think
not.
under
those
circumstances,
if
alabama
prosecuted
him,
that
would
be
double
jeopardy
in
georgia.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
now,
i
have
a
number
of
points
to
make
if
i
may.
with
respect
to
the
analogy
to
civil
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
substantial
differences
between
civil
and
criminal
law
jurisdiction.
for
example,
full
faith
and
credit,
collateral
estoppel,
res
judicata.
if
you
were
to
accept
an
analogy
to
civil
jurisdiction,
presumably
you
would
accept
an
analogy
to
that.
if
that
is
true,
then
this
case
in
georgia
would
be
res
judicata
in
alabama,
and
thus
be...
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
it
wouldn't
have
arisen.
the
respondent
says
there
are
no
cases
discussing
interest.
we
discussed
these
cases,
and
i
will
not
read
from
the
quotes
on
page
30
of
our
brief.
it
is
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
important
issues
that
this
court
has
faced
has
been
the
interest
underlying
the
institutional
relationships
when
it
has
decided
the
scope
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
alabama
also
asserts
that
even
applying
my
test,
the
test
that
i
suggest,
you
ought
to
come
out
for
them
here
because
there
would
be
intergovernmental
conflict.
i
don't
understand
that.
if
you
had
a
situation,
say,
where
georgia
wished
to
prosecute
somebody
to
preempt
alabama
from
doing
so
and
wouldn't
cooperate,
i
take
it
they
don't
have
to
extradite
them
either,
so
that
extending
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
to
resolve
that
conflict
doesn't
resolve
it.
now,
georgia
could
just
keep
custody
of
the
person
and
not
let
alabama
discharge
their
law
no
matter
what
you
do
about
the
dual
sovereignty
exception.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
some
of
your
questions
that
every
time
you
have
two
prosecutions,
the
second
prosecuting
authority
wants
to
raise
the
punishment.
it
is
the
only
reason
to
prosecute.
that
fact--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--yes.
well,
it
is
not
invalid.
it
is
not
enough.
if
it
were
enough,
we
would
have
no
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
is
not
enough,
and
what
the
cases
say
here
is,
you
need
something
other
than
that
to
get
around
the
prohibition
that
is
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
i
don't
know
when
he
would
he
eligible
for
parole.
i
do
know
what
the
average
length
of
sentence
is
in
georgia.
it
is
15
years.
it
is
not--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--average
length,
average
is
about
15
years.
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
j.
allen
--i
have
been
informed,
and
if
you
would
like
us
to
give
you
statistics
on
this,
i
would
be
most
happy
to
provide
it,
that
the
average
sentence
in
georgia
is
15
years
for
life
for
murder.
i
don't
think
it
much
matters
whether
there
was
a
joint
investigation
or
simply
close
cooperation,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
on
page
388
of
the
record,
mr.
boswell,
who
works
for
alabama,
testified
to
the
following:
"question:
and
these
actions
that
you...
this
investigation,
was
it
under
the
auspices
strictly
of
russell
county
sheriff's
office.
"
which
is
in
alabama.
"absolutely.
"
"yes,
sir.
"
"question:
you
weren't
aiding
or
investigation
another
state's
sheriff's
department?
"
"answer:
it
was
a
mutual
thing.
"
"they
were
assisting
us
with
our
investigation,
and
