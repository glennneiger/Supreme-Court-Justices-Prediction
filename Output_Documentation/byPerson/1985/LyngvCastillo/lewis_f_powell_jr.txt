what
about
aid
based
on
indigent
children,
aid
to
dependent
children?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
food
stamps
also
being
given
to
families
who
receive
that
sort
of
aid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
the
program
with
respect
to
disabled
persons?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
add
all
three
together
and
they
gave
them
to
a
family,
you
would
come
to
some
limit?
i
suppose
you
do.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
greater
the
number
of
children
and
the
greater
the
number
of
disabled
people,
of
course,
the
greater
the
aid.
is
that
correct?
