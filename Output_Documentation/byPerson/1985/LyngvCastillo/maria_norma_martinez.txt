unconstitutional--
ms.
maria
norma

--seven
usc
2012(i),
the
family
rule,
unconstitutionally
interferes
with
the
appellees'
family
choices
of...
family
choices
of
living
together.
not
only
does
it
interfere
with
the
right
to
live
together.
the
harm
caused
the
appellees
outweighs
the
state's
interests.
the
district
court
found
that
the
family
rule,
the
food
stamp
family
rule
put
families
at
a
distinct
disadvantage.
unrelated
individuals
could
obtain
separate
household
status
simply
by
purchasing
and
preparing
food
separately.
families,
no
matter
what,
could
never
go
in
and
show
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
prepare
food
together
and
show
that
they
could
not
possibly
function
as
a
single
economic
unit.
the
only
exception
was
for
elderly
and
for
disabled
parents
and
siblings.
the
appellees
are
eight
families,
eight
guest
families
and
eight
host
families
that
live
together.
there
are
more
than
30
children
involved
with
these
families.
all
of
the
appellees
have
children,
young
children
of
their
own
to
support.
all
but
one
of
them
had
maintained
a
separate
household
before
economic
necessity
forced
them
to
move
in
with
their
relatives.
there
was
no
question
that
they
were
eligible
for
food
stamps
as
a
separate
household
but
for
the
family...
natividad
castillo
and
his
wife
and
eight
children
were
migrant
workers.
they
went
up
north
to
michigan
to
work
in
seasonal
labor.
when
they
returned
home,
they
had
no
income,
they
had
no
assets
but
one
old
car.
they
had
to
move
in
with
mrs.
castillo's
daughter
from
a
previous
marriage.
theresa
barrera
was
receiving
food
stamps.
she
had
two
children
of
her
own,
and
was
receiving
welfare.
the
food
stamp
office
denied
the
castillo
family's
application
for
food
stamps.
not
only
did
they
deny
the
application
for
food
stamps,
they
refused
to
supplement
mrs.
barrera's
food
stamp
allotment
for
that
first
month,
so
the
castillo
family
would
have
been
left
without
any
food
stamps
that
first
month.
after
that
they
would
have
received
a
reduced
amount
based
on
both
households'
income,
which
in
this
case
was
theresa
barrera's
welfare
income,
even
though
ms.
barrera's
income
was
not
available
to
the
castillos.
a
similar
thing
happened
to
the
cody
family,
also
migrant
workers,
also
went
up
to
michigan,
and
went
home
and
had
no
income.
they
were
unemployed.
they
had
two
young
children.
they
moved
in
with
robert
cody's
mother.
she
had
five
children
to
support
off
her
veterans
administration
check,
and
she
was
receiving
food
stamps.
robert
and
jerry
cody's
food
stamp
application
was
denied,
and
the
food
stamp
office
refused
to
supplement
robert's
mother's
allotment
so
that
robert
and
jerry
and
two
children,
the
two
young
children
could
have
food
stamps
for
the
first
month.
three
of
the
appellees'
families
are
headed
by
women
who
are
little
more
lucky.
they
received
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
after
they
separated
from
their
husbands
and
moved
in
with
relatives.
two
of
them
moved
in
with
their
parents.
they
had
lived
separately.
they
had
maintained
a
separate
home
all
that
time,
but
due
to
the
family
rule
they
could
not
receive
food
stamps
separately,
even
though
they
purchased
and
prepared
separately,
even
though
their
host
family's
income
was
not
available
to
them.
one
of
the
appellees'
families,
cecilia
villafranca,
moved
in
with
her
brother.
she
had
been
receiving
food
stamps,
but
due
to
the
family
rule,
she
would
not
have
received
anything
because
of
her
brother's
income
because
both
families
were
deemed
to
be
one
household.
two
of
the
families
were
headed
by
men.
elias
ruiz,
his
wife,
and
two
children
moved
in
with
elias's
mother
and
her
son.
they
didn't
need
any
help
other
than
a
place
to
live
until
mr.
ruiz
became
unemployed
and
his
wife
became
too
ill
to
work
and
was
hospitalized.
they
then
applied
for
food
stamps
and
could
not
get
them
because
of
the
family
rules.
gregorio
alvarado
and
his
wife
and
three
young
children
moved
in
with
gregorio's
sister
and
brother-in-law
and
their
children.
gregorio
was
unemployed.
his
wife
was
also
too
ill
to
work.
they
couldn't
get
food
stamps
as
a
separate
household.
and
finally,
sylvia
nieto,
the
only
one
who
had
not
maintained
a
separate
household.
sylvia
nieto
was
an
adult
woman
with
a
child
to
support.
she
was
disabled,
received
supplemental
security
income
benefits.
the
benefits
she
used
to
support
herself
and
her
son.
she
had
been
receiving
food
stamps
as
a
separate
household
until
the
family
rule
came
into
effect.
the
family
rule,
whereas
it
might
be
reasonable
to
believe
that
families
are
more
likely
to
purchase
and
prepare
food
together,
it
is
not
reasonable
to
believe
that
these
families
would
commit
fraud,
would
like
so
they
could
obtain
separate
household
status.
that
is
why,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
family
rule
is
irrational.
when
people
like
the
appellees,
people
who
have
no
place
to
go,
have
no
money,
have
children
to
support,
show
up
at
their
relatives'
home,
the
relative,
who
is
slightly
better
off
because
they
have
a
place
to
live,
who
may
not
be
that
much
better
off,
because
they
may
also
be
on
welfare,
as
theresa
barrera
was,
has
a
hard
choice
to
make.
do
they
allow
their
relatives
in
and
deprive
their
own
spouse
and
children?
even
someone
who
is
better
off
will
have
to
think
about
that.
and
if
they
do
allow
them
in
and
then
find
out
that
they
cannot
support,
either
partially
or
completely,
their
relatives,
they
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
deprive
their
own
family
so
that
the
relatives
can
stay
with
them.
that
would
be
a
hard
choice
for
anyone,
but
a
lot
harder
for
somebody
who
is
barely
existing,
for
somebody
who
is
on
welfare.
and
the
guest
families,
the
guest
family
is
the
one
that
of
course
will
suffer
the
most.
they
will
have
no
control
over
their
situation.
they
will
have
children
to
support.
if
their
host,
if
their
relatives
allow
them
in,
the
guest
family
will
have
to...
mercy.
if
the
host
family
refuses
to
do
more,
the
guest
will
only
have
a
place
to
stay.
if
the
host
family
refuses
to
apply
for
food
stamps,
the
guest
family
cannot
obtain
food
stamps
on
their
own.
and
it
isn't
that
unlikely
that
someone
would
refuse
to
apply
for
food
stamps.
disclosures
about
employment,
wages,
all
other
resources
such
as
life
insurance
and
death
insurance,
burial
insurance,
everything
is
required
to
be
reported
for
food
stamp
eligibility,
and
this
information
is
routinely
verified
by
the
food
stamp
office,
employees,
neighbors,
anyone
who
knows
the
circumstances
of
the
applicants
can
be
used
to
verify
the
information.
the
food
stamp
office
also
uses
announced
home
visits
to
determine
if
the
information
is
correct.
if
the
family
is
slightly
better
off
and
has
a
car
worth
$6,001,
the
aggregation
of
resources
would
make
them
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
even
if
this
family
owed
$5,900
on
that
car,
the
fair
market
value
of
the
car
is
what
is
used.
a
first
family
vehicle
will
receive
a
$4,500
exemption.
it
would
still
make
them
ineligible
for
food
stamps.
the
joining
of
resources
such
as
two
cars
would
cause
these
people
to
be
ineligible
for
food
stamps
also.
a
car
in
places
like
rural
texas
is
a
necessity.
it
is
not
a
luxury.
it
could
not
be
considered
a
luxury
as
it
would
be
in
a
city.
farm
workers
need
their
cars
so
they
can
get
to
and
from
the
fields.
places
like
harlingen,
texas,
where
robert
cody
lives,
does
not
have
mass
public
transportation.
you
need
a
car
so
you
can
work.
the
government
justifies
the
family
rule
as
necessary
to
prevent
fraud
and
abuse.
it
is
the
same
justification
that
was
used
for
the
unrelated
persons
provision
in
united
states
department
of
agriculture
versus
moreno.
in
that
case,
the
government
said
that
congress
reasonably
believed
that
unrelated
persons
were
more
likely
to
commit
fraud
so
that
they
could
obtain
household
status
so
they
could
obtain
food
stamps,
so
that
they
could
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program,
and
that
it
was
administratively
inefficient
for
the
food
stamp
agency
to
determine
when
the
unrelated
people
were
committing
fraud.
they
argued
that
college
students
live
together
and
were
voluntarily
poor.
they
didn't
report
the
income
they
received
from
the
outside,
and
it
was
extremely
difficult,
maybe
impossible
for
that
determination
of
fraud
to
be
made.
the
court
found
in
moreno
that
the
unrelated
persons
provision
served
not
to
exclude
those
that
were
intent,
those
that
were
most
likely
to
abuse
the
food
stamp
program,
but
only
those
who
were
so
destitute
that
they
could
not
alter
their
living
conditions
so
they
could
retain
the
eligibility
for
food
stamps.
the
same
thing
happens
here.
the
family
rule
causes
people
that
have
no
place
to
go
to
become
ineligible
for
food
stamps
or
receive
the
reduced
amount,
an
amount
that
is
not
based
on
their
resources.
and
alternatives,
alternative
provisions
can
be
made
if
it
were
to
be
conceded
that
there
is
a
problem
with
fraud
by
families,
the
burden
could
be
placed
on
the
family
to
show
why
they
could
not
function
as
a
single
economic
unit
or
why
they
could
not
purchase
and
prepare
food
together.
problems
like
health
problems,
contagious
diseases,
where
they
could
not
purchase
and
prepare
food
together,
are
things
that
can
be
determined
from
the
initial
application
and
initial
food
stamp
interview.
differential
work
schedules.
presently
from
the
food
stamp
application
and
from
the
initial
interview.
questions
about
where
a
person
works,
their
employer,
the
hours
worked,
and
verification
of
that
is
made.
from
that
they
could
find
out
about
differential
work
schedules
that
make
it
impossible
for
people
to
purchase
and
prepare
food
together.
inadequate
kitchen
facilities
where,
because
of
the
inadequacies
of
a
poor
family
kitchen
they
cannot
purchase
and
prepare
together.
that
determination
can
be
made
from
questions.
and
it
isn't
unlikely
that
a
poor
family
will
have
an
inadequate
kitchen,
will
have
a
stove
that
is
two
burners
instead
of
what
is
considered
the
usual
stove
with
four
burners
with
an
oven.
that
they
will
not
have
refrigeration.
that
they
will
not
have
other
than
a
small
table,
if
they
have
a
table
at
all,
with
two
chairs,
if
they
have
two
chairs
at
all.
these
people
cannot
purchase
and
prepare,
they
certainly
cannot
prepare
food
together.
ms.
maria
norma
martinez
yes,
i
believe
so.
at
least
that
the
family
be
given
an
opportunity
that
they
do
not
purchase
and
prepare
food
together.
ms.
maria
norma
martinez
it
is
not
in
the
record,
but
for
unrelated
families,
they
generally
take
the
statement
of
the
unrelated
person.
ms.
maria
norma
martinez
and
that
is
generally
the
end
of
it.
ms.
maria
norma
martinez
that
is
right.
the
harm
done
to
the
children.
the
majority
of
food
stamp
recipients
are
families
with
children.
children
in
this
case
would
suffer
from
hunger.
in
plyler
versus
doe,
this
court
looked
at
the
hard
cost
to
children
after
saying,
after
repeating
that
education
is
not
a
fundamental
right,
and
that
alien
status
is
not
a
suspect
classification.
the
court
looked
at
the
harm
done
to
the
children.
the
denial
of
an
education
caused
them
such
a
hardship
that
the
state's
interest
in
conserving
money,
the
state's
interest
in
keeping
the
legal
immigrants
out
did
not
outweigh
the
harm
done
to
the
children.
yes,
the
court
said
that
education
is
not
a
mere
welfare
benefit.
but
food
stamps...
and
in
reality
for
a
lot
of
these
people
if
you
don't
get
food
stamps
you
don't
get
food.
you
don't
eat.
food
stamps
are
crucial
to
life.
food
stamps
are
a
necessity.
other
welfare
benefits
you
may
be
able
to
do
without
for
a
while.
without
food,
you
won't
be
able
to
do
without.
the
children
in
this
case,
if
deprived,
or
when
deprived
of
the
necessary
food
during
the
years
of
development
of
their
minds
and
bodies,
can
end
up
in
the
worst
situation,
can
be
harmed
a
lot
more
than
the
children
in
plyler
were.
the
children
in
plyler
perhaps
could
receive
remedial
education.
children
in
this
case,
once
they
are
harmed
lack
of
food,
malnutrition,
stunting
of
their
growth,
mental
and
physical,
can
become
permanently
disabled.
they
may
never
be
able...
they
may
be
educationally
disabled.
they
will
become
a
burden
on
society,
economically
dependent
for
the
rest
of
their
life.
this
regulation,
this
limitation
is
not
only
substantial,
because
deprivation
of
food
is
substantial,
although
families
are
not
prohibited
from
living
together,
the
effect
of
this
rule
will
cause
them
not
to
live
together.
once
the
host
family
finds
they
cannot
eat
if
the
guest
comes
in,
the
effect
is,
they
cannot
live
together.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
the
appellees
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
district
court's
decision.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
nothing
else
to
say.
ms.
maria
norma
martinez
well,
your
honor,
i
simply
can't
answer
that
question.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
