is
there
anything
in
the
record,
mr.
minear,
which
shows
the
difference
in
cost
between
the
two

well,
mr.
minear,
were
these
amendments'
principal
purpose
to
prevent
fraud?
justice

as
far
as
they
were
designed
to
prevent
fraud,
is
it
rational
to
assume
that
families
are
more
likely
to
defraud
the
government
than
unrelated
individuals?
