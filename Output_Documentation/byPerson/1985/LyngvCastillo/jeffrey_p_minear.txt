mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government
defends
the
constitutionality
of
section
3(i)
of
the
food
stamp
act,
which
provides
that
parents
and
children
or
siblings
who
live
together
shall
be
treated
as
a
single
household
for
food
stamp
entitlement
purposes.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas.
the
district
court
ruled
that
section
3(i)
violates
equal
protection
principles
by
discriminating
against
families
and
by
impermissibly
burdening
family
decisions
to
live
together.
after
briefly
describing
the
food
stamp
program
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
will
explain
why
the
district
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
the
food
stamp
act
establishes
a
social
welfare
program
funded
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
administered
by
state
agencies.
it
supplements
the
food
purchasing
power
of
low
income
households.
under
this
program
state
agencies
distribute
food
stamps
to
needy
households
on
the
basis
of
standard
allotments
that
take
into
account
household
size.
the
food
stamp
program
has
grown
rapidly
since
its
creation
in
1964.
it
is
now
the
nation's
second
most
costly
needs-based
public
assistance
program.
in
1983,
program
outlays
were
over
$11
billion,
providing
assistance
to
over
21
million
program
participants.
the
huge
cost
and
dramatic
growth
of
the
food
stamp
program
have
produced
public
concern
over
reports
of
widespread
waste
and
fraud.
in
1981
and
again
in
1982
congress
amended
the
food
stamp
act
to
improve
program
efficiency
and
to
curtail
certain
types
of
frequently
encountered
recipient
abuse.
congress
gave
particular
attention
to
the
food
stamp
act's
definition
of
the
term
"household".
prior
to
1981,
persons
who
lived
together
but
purchased
and
prepared
their
meals
separately
could
claim
separate
household
status,
and
thereby
receive
higher
per
capita
benefits.
as
a
result
families
frequently
mischaracterized
their
members
as
separate
households
to
obtain
additional
food
stamps.
congress
in
response
amended
the
household
definition
to
provide
that
parents
and
children
or
siblings
who
live
together
shall
be
treated
as
one
household
for
food
stamp
entitlement
purposes
regardless
of
their
actual
meal
purchase
and
preparation
habits.
congress
also
provided
a
special
exception,
permitting
elderly
and
disabled
parents
and
siblings
to
qualify
as
a
separate
household
if
they
in
fact
did
separately
prepare
their
meals.
these
amendments
to
the
household
definition
were
specifically
designed
to
assure
the
nation's
limited
welfare
resources
were
efficiently
distributed
to
those
in
greatest
need.
appellee
natividad
castillo
and
his
family
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
revised
household
definition.
they
claimed
that
the
new
definition
violated
equal
protection
principles
by
denying
certain
family
members
the
opportunity
to
claim
separate
household
status.
the
district
court
consolidated
their
action
with
three
other
suits
raising
similar
equal
protection
claims.
the
district
court
ultimately
held
that
the
household
definition
is
unconstitutional,
and
enjoined
its
application
against
the
appellees.
the
court
acknowledged
that
section
3(i)'s
treatment
of
family
members
had
a
rational
basis,
therefore
it
meets
the
generally
applicable
equal
protection
requirements.
the
court
concluded,
however,
that
family-based
classifications
are
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny.
it
then
held
without
further
analysis
that
section
3(i)
violated
the
appellees'
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record,
but
it
is
clear
from
the
regulations
themselves,
and
the
regulations
provide,
for
instance,
that
an
eight-member
household
would
receive
75
percent
of
the
benefits
that
would
be
given
to
eight
separate
households,
and
that
two
four-member
households
receive
110
percent
of
the
benefits
of
the
eight-member
household.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
erred
in
concluding
that
section
3(i)
violates
equal
protection
principles.
instead,
section
3(i)'s
household
definition
represents
a
rational
legislative
intent
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
the
food
stamp
program
by
adopting
standards
that
as
a
general
matter
direct
the
nation's
limited
welfare
resources
to
those
with
the
greatest
need.
we
note
first,
as
the
district
court
agreed,
that
section
3(i)'s
household
definition
meets
the
rational
basis
test.
congress
enacted
the
revised
household
definition
in
response
to
serious
public
concern
over
the
size,
effectiveness,
and
integrity
of
the
food
stamp
program.
the
1981
and
1982
congressional
hearings
revealed
that
from
11
to
20
percent
of
food
stamp
benefits
were
issued
in
error,
amounting
to
a
program
loss
of
from
$1
to
$2
billion
per
year.
those
hearings
also
revealed
that
the
practice
of
family
members
falsely
claiming
separate
household
status
was
one
of
the
most
serious
forms
of
abuse.
finally,
the
hearings
revealed
that
in
light
of
the
large
number
of
families
that
participate
in
the
food
stamp
program,
there
is
no
effective
and
efficient
means
for
verifying
family
household
status.
congress
therefore
elected
to
redefine
the
term
"household"
as
a
workable
solution
to
this
serious
and
costly
problem.
the
refined
definition
represents
the
rational
congressional
judgment
based
on
thorough
investigation
and
deliberation
that
food
stamp
abuses
can
be
reduced
and
benefits
preserved
for
those
most
in
need
by
treating
family
members
who
live
together
as
a
single
household.
furthermore,
this
definition
is
carefully
tailored
to
provide
special
relief
for
elderly
and
disabled
parents
and
siblings,
those
family
members
that
congress
determined
were
most
in
need
of
special
treatment.
in
short,
section
3(i)'s
revised
"household"
definition
represents
the
type
of
reasonable
classification
that
is
routinely
employed
in
social
welfare
programs.
the
revised
definition
plainly
withstands
rational
basis
scrutiny,
the
type
of
scrutiny
this
court
applies
to
these
types
of
classifications.
indeed,
the
district
court
as
well
as
all
other
courts
that
considered
this
issue
agree
that
the
"household"
definition
meets
the
rational
basis
test.
the
district
court
went
astray
in
applying
heightened
scrutiny
to
the
food
stamp
act's
"household"
definition
because
plainly
family
members,
the
class
affected
by
the
"household
definition",
do
not
represent
a
suspect
or
quasi-suspect
class.
furthermore,
the
"household"
definition
does
not
result
in
any
constitutionally
significant
limitation
on
individual
choice
in
family
matters.
heightened
scrutiny
has
been
applied
to
laws
affecting
family-based
decision
only
when
the
government's
action
directly
and
substantially
interferes
with
important
family
choices.
here,
the
household
definition
does
not
prevent
any
group
of
persons,
related
or
unrelated,
from
living
together,
and
if
they
live
together,
from
dining
apart.
it
simply
allocates
food
stamp
benefits
to
families
in
light
of
the
cooperative
arrangements
that
families
generally
employ.
the
revised
definition
may
provide
financial
incentive
for
closely
related
family
members
who
live
together
to
purchase
and
prepare
their
meals
together
as
well,
but
it
neither
compels
nor
prohibits
any
family-based
decision.
family
members
retain
the
full
range
of
choice
in
structuring
their
living
and
meal
preparation
habits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
were
designed
both
to
prevent
fraud
and
also
to
improve
program
efficiency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it
is
clear
that
families
are
better
situation
in
fact
to
falsely
claim
separate
household
status,
and
it
also
seems
that
family
members
are
more
likely
to
purchase
and
prepare
their
meals
together.
in
terms
of
actual
intent,
are
family
members
more
likely
to
create
fraud?
i
don't
think
you
can
really
draw
that
inference,
but
i
do
think
it
is
true
that
they
are
best
situation
in
fact
to
conduct
fraudulent
activities.
it
is
also
true
that
family
members
are
the
largest
component
of
the
food
stamp
program.
they
represent
almost
three-quarters
of
food
stamp
participants.
therefore
by
eliminating
this
potential
for
abuse
from
family
members,
we
have
significantly
reduced
the
potential
possibility
for
fraud
in
the
program.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
problem
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
it
would
be
difficult,
and
it
would
be
rather
intrusive
as
well.
if
the
test
depends
on
whether
or
not
family
members
are
in
fact
dining
together,
there
is
no
readily
available
method
to
in
fact
prove
whether
or
not
they
are
dining
together
or
dining
separately.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
is
also
true
that
it
is
difficult
in
those
cases,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
but
it
is
also
a
more
limited
number
of
cases.
it
also
seems
more
likely--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
it
might
be
a
growing
number
as
well,
and
it
might
be,
too,
that
congress
will
eventually
determine
that
in
fact
no
one
should
be
able
to
claim
separate
household
status
when
they
live
together.
congress
has
considered
that
possibility.
that
has
been
suggested
by
the
various
federal
and
state
food
stamp
administrators.
but
congress
at
present
is
content
to
retain
the
special
exception
for
elderly
and
disabled
persons
and
also
for
unrelated
persons.
the
"household"
definition's
impact
on
family
living
arrangements
is
no
different
from
that
of
a
broad
variety
of
other
legislative
provisions
that
consider
family
status
in
allocating
public
burdens
and
benefits.
in
sum,
the
revised
definition
of
the
term
"household"
represents
a
permissible
classification
designed
to
promote
the
efficiency
and
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
food
stamp
program.
appellees
defend
the
district
court's
decision
on
two
additional
grounds
not
relied
upon
by
the
district
court.
appellees
first
contend
that
the
"household"
definition
creates
an
unconstitutional
irrebuttable
presumption.
that
contention
is
mistaken.
the
"household"
definition
creates
a
legitimate
legislative
classification
like
that
upheld
in
weinberger
versus
salfi.
as
in
salfi,
that
provides
for
distribution
of
benefits
based
on
objective
criteria
that
congress
has
determined
relevant
to
its
legitimate
welfare
policy
roles.
appellees
also
contend
that
food
stamp
recipients
have
a
special
right
to
increased
benefits
because
of
the
importance
of
a
health
diet.
this
contention,
not
raised
below,
is
also
mistaken.
appellees
do
not
have
an
inherent,
fundamental
right
to
federal
food
purchasing
assistance.
congress
may
impose
limitations
on
food
stamp
benefits
as
on
other
forms
of
social
welfare
benefits,
to
promote
efficiency
and
to
prevent
abuse.
at
bottom,
appellees
urge
this
court
to
declare
the
food
stamp
act
"household"
definition
unconstitutional
on
public
policy
grounds.
however,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated,
the
judgement
of
congress
on
questions
of
social
welfare
policy
is
entitled
to
special
deference.
courts
do
not
sit
to
pass
on
policy
or
the
wisdom
of
the
course
that
congress
has
chosen.
in
this
case,
congress
has
determined
that
the
refined
definition
of
"household"
is
necessary
to
reduce
serious
fraud
in
the
food
stamp
program,
and
to
preserve
the
nation's
limited
benefits
for
those
with
greatest
need.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
congress
on
this
quintessential
legislative
question
should
be
respected,
and
we
therefore
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
just
a
few
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
regrettable
problem
here
is,
the
government's
resources
for
welfare
are
limited,
and
in
order
to
provide
maximum
use
of
those
limited
resources,
certain
broad
categories
and
general
characteristics
must
be
used
in
order
to
distribute
these
social
welfare
benefits,
and
it
simply
is
not
effective
to
expend
those
limited
resources
on
case
by
case
determinations
when
in
fact
those
resources
can
be
directed
to
the
persons
themselves
who
need
them.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
might
be
right,
your
honor.
however,
those
are
a
much
smaller
portion
of
the
total
number
of
food
stamp
recipients
in
the
program.
therefore
what
congress
in
fact
is
doing
is
directing
its
limited
resources
to
those
areas
where
there
is
the
greatest
possible
need
for
special
exceptions,
and
that
was
in
fact
congress's
thinking,
in
fact,
preserving
this
separate
household
status
for
unrelated
persons
and
the
elderly
and
the
disabled.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
food
stamps
are
available
under
both
programs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct
also.
supplemental
social
security--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
am
not
certain
about
the
regulations
here,
but
i
believe
it
might
be...
some
of
those
sources
of
income
might
be
treated
as
income
for
the
food
stamp
program
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
this
was
the
subject
of
a
1981
hearing.
one
of
the
things
that
the
gac
pointed
out
was
that
in
fact
in
larger
family
groups
families
often
receive
aid
from
a
number
of...
food
aid
from
a
number
of
different
sources,
including
the
school
lunch
program
and
also
the
breakfast
program
that
is
provided
in
a
number
of
schools,
and
as
a
result
of
this,
in
fact,
some
food
stamp
families
did
receive
more
aid
than
the
average
family
spent
on
food
purchases.
now,
i
think
this
is
probably
the
exceptional
case,
but
nevertheless
this
was
one
of
the
concerns
that
went
into
congress's
determination
in
amending
the
"household"
definition.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
generally
true.
to
be
slightly
more
accurate
about
this,
since
1978,
the
regulations
provided
that
husbands
and
wives
in
fact
would
be
treated
as
a
single
household.
that
was
a
regulatory
provision
that
has
been
in
force
for
almost
ten
years.
in
addition,
the
definition
of
a
spouse
provided
that
persons
who
are
unrelated
who
are
living
together,
who
hold
themselves
out
as
a
spouse
even
though
they
are
not
married,
in
fact
would
be
treated
as
a
single
household.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
would
be
eligible--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--sure.
they
would
be
eligible
to
in
fact
apply
for
food
stamps
on
that
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
regulations
provide
for
three
types
of
documentation
in
these
matters,
first
documentary
evidence
which
might
in
fact
indicate
that
two
persons
worked
different
shifts.
they
can
provide
their
work
schedules
to
the
food
stamp
office.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
there
is
a
periodic
rechecking
of
the
qualifications
to
make
sure
that
these
people
continue
to
apply.
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
done
on
a
monthly
or
a
quarterly
basis,
but
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
government
has
no
interest
in
whether
they
should
live
together
or
not.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
how
food
stamps
should
be
allocated
once
they
make
that
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
this
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
this
is
similar
to
the
califano
v.
jobst
case,
where
in
fact
this
is
an
indirect
burden
on
the
family
living
arrangements.
in
califano
v.
jobst--
