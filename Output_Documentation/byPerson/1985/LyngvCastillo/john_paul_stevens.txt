ms.
martinez,
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
do
you
think
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
if
it
established
a
presumption
that
the
related
families
did
purchase
and
prepare
food
together,
but
that
unrelated
families
did
not,
and
then
there
would
be
a
burden
on
the
particular
family
to
show
that
on
a
regular
basis
they
acted
contrary
to
the
presumption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
agency
follow
up
on
determining...
say
they
have
an
initial
interview,
and
they
describe
their
living
arrangements,
and
they
take
it
at
face
value.
how
is
this
normally
checked
later
on
to
see
if...
for
example,
an
unrelated
family,
that
they
really
are
separate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course
in
the
related
family
situation
there
just
wouldn't
be
any
followup
at
all
under
the
rules
now
because
they
are
just
presumed
to
always
share
their
food
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
another
question
just
to
get
it
straight
in
my
mind?
if
you
have,
say,
a
married
couple
that
live
together,
and
they
qualify
on
an
income
basis,
they
presumably...
in
fact,
they
definitely
are
held
to
be
one
household,
and
yet
they
get
the
same
amount
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whereas
if
two
unrelated
persons
lived
together
and
they
came
in
and
filed
the
appropriate
applications
and
made
a
representation
that
one
worked
a
night
shift
and
the
other
a
day
shift,
so
they
purchased
their
food
and
prepared
it
separately,
they
would
then
get
a
somewhat
larger
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
come
in
and
say
they
don't
do
that,
they
just
happen
to
live
in
the
same
facility,
and
they
work
different
hours
and
so
forth.
so
they
then
would
qualify
as
unrelated
persons.
say
they
were
the
same
sex.
justice
john
paul
stevens
make
it
simple.
say
they
are
the
same
sex.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
after
they
apply
and
they
are
granted
initial,
what
kind
of
followup
is
there
to
find
out,
well,
maybe
their
hours
changed
and
they
now
have
decided
they
could
eat
at
the
same
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
they
qualify
initially.
i
am
asking
what
happens,
say,
30
days
later.
is
there
any
periodic
followup
to
be
sure
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
so
that
only
has
to
be
done
for
the
unrelated
persons.
