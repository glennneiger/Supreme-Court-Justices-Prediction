was
the
confession
admitted
in
evidence
earlier
in
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
thomas
was
being
tried
at
the
same
time
as
she
was?

william

rehnquist
wouldn't
you
expect
trial
counsel
to
be
listening
when
the
judge
is
sentencing
his
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
evers,
do
you
know
of
any
case
coming
from
a
state
court
system
where
this
court
has
ever
said
that
the
case
should
be
tried
before
a
different
state
trial
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
wine-banks,
what
again
is
your
theory
under
the
law
of
evidence
limited
by
the
constitution
as
to
how
thomas's
confession
comes
in
against
lee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
had
a
five-page
confession
that
went
into
great
detail
as
to
just
how
a
crime
had
been
committed,
and
perhaps
implicated
several
other
people.
would
the
fact
that
the
bottom
line
of
the
confession,
so
to
speak,
is
against
penal
interest
of
the
person
making
it
make
that
all
admissible
just
without
limitation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
either
of
the
defendants
take
the
stand
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
didn't
testify
as
to
the
merits,
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
that
case
bruton
wouldn't
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
were
available
for
cross
examination.
