justice

mrs.
wine-banks,
what
is
the
illinois
law
regarding
admission
of
evidence
if
there
were
a
single
confession
by
thomas,
no
confession
by
mrs.
lee,
and
the
thomas
confession
was
inculpatory?
is
it
admissible,
the
entire
thing,
as
a
statement
against
penal
interest
against
ms.
lee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
does
illinois
as
a
matter
of
state
law
of
evidence
say
that
where
there
are
two
confessions,
as
here,
that
they
are
both
admissible
against
the
other
as
a
matter
of
statements
against
penal
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
are
interlocking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
has
illinois
defined
for
itself
what
interlocking
means
and
what
happens
when
they
are
only
partially
interlocking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
know
what
the
illinois
law
of
evidence
is
that
applies
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
illinois
law,
you
say
that
any
objection
to
the
use
of
the
confession
was
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
was
the
earliest
time
that
an
objection
could
properly
have
been
made
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
in
reading
his
findings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
after
he
had
made
them,
but
he
was
reading
them
in
public,
and
at
that
time
you
say
illinois
required
an
objection
to
be
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
was--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
was
neither
an
objection
nor
a
post-trial
motion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
is
a
waiver
under
illinois
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
there
was
an
agreement
by
the
judge
to
limit
the
use
of
the
confessions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
would
we
find
that
in
the
material
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
evidence
as
to
odessa
is
not
as
clear,
is
it,
against
ms.
lee,
based
on
her
own
confession
alone?
