mr.
evers,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
that
the
failure
to
object
was
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
point
in
calling
more
attention
to
it
and
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
in
the
long
run
given
the
totality
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
evidence
was
not
strong,
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
not
strong
independent
of
this
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
ask
also
that
it
be
referred
to
a
different
judge
for
trial?

warren
e.
burger

do
you
ask
for
it?
chief

or
material
differences
in
the
