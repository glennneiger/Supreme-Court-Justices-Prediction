mr.
dan
w.
evers
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
case
of
millie
r.
lee
versus
illinois.
i
represent
the
petitioner,
millie
r.
lee,
who
was
convicted
in
the
circuit
court
of
st.
clair
county,
illinois,
of
the
murders
of
odessa
harris
and
mattie
darden.
the
issue
presented
before
this
court
today
is
one
involving
significant
rights
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
involving
the
confrontation
clause.
the
specific
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
those
amendments
were
violated
when
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
sitting
as
the
trier
of
fact
stated
on
the
record
that
he
was
considering
the
co-defendant's
confession
against
my
client,
millie
r.
lee,
in
finding
her
guilty
of
the
two
murders
of
odessa
harris
and
mattie
darden.
the
issue
arises
specifically
because
in
this
case
in
a
bench
trial
the
judge
noted
that
he
was
considering
this
as
substantive
evidence.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
your
honor,
the
confession
of
edwin
thomas
was
admitted
by
the
trial
court
judge
earlier,
and
it
was
found
to
be
admissible
against
edwin
thomas
by
the
trial
court
judge
at
that
time,
yes.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
and
it
was
a
joint
trial.
the
petitioner
millie
lee
and
the
co-defendant
edwin
thomas
had
waived
jury
trial
previously,
and
the
day
of
trial
they
came
in
and
waived
out
a
motion
to
sever
the
case
from
each
other,
and
they
agreed
that
a
bench
trial
would
be
proper
if
the
judge
considered
the
appropriate
evidence
only
against
each
defendant.
at
trial--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--there
was
no
objection
made
to
the
admission
of
the
statement
into
evidence
except
with
the
understanding
that
the
evidence
was
to
be
considered
separately.
at
the
beginning
of
trial
when
they
said
that
their
motion
to
sever
would
be
moot
or
disregarded,
it
is
because
they
went
in
on
the
understanding
that
the
judge
would
be
able
to
consider
the
evidence
separately
against
each
defendant.
the
general
rule
of
law,
of
course,
is
that
the
judge
can
compartmentalize
his
mind
and
separate
the
evidence
and
consider
the
evidence
separately.
that
is
why--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--at
the
very
beginning
of
trial,
when
they
walk
about
the
judge
considering
the
evidence
separately,
judge
hobin,
who
was
the
trial
court
judge,
does
state
that
he
would
do
that,
and
so
this
trial
began
on
the
basis
that
the
judge
would
separate
the
evidence
and
consider
the
admissible
evidence
only
against
each
co-defendant.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
when
he
finds
my
client,
millie
lee,
guilty
at
the
end
of
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
and
at
the
end
of
arguments
by
counsel,
the
trial
court
judge
states
in
his
finding
of
guilt
that
the
petitioner
is
guilty
as
charged,
and
he
states,
i
reject...
basically
he
says,
i
reject
her
defense
because
her
argument
is
that
she
was
not
guilty
of
the
murder
of
odessa
harris
because
she
had
no
intent
to
kill,
did
not
plan
to
kill,
and
did
not
know
that
edwin
thomas
was
going
to
kill
odessa
harris,
and
that
her
second
defense
was
that
the
killing
of
mattie
darden
would
be
voluntary
manslaughter.
the
trial
court
judge
says,
i
reject
that
because
whether
there
is
a
plan
to
kill
is
disputed
by
the
co-defendant's
confession.
the
co-defendant's
confession
clearly
shows
that
there
was
premeditation,
and
then
he
also
says
that
he
rejects
voluntary
manslaughter
because
the
co-defendant's
confession
says
that
edwin
thomas
had
asked
her
to
go
in
and
take
care
of
mattie
darden.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
asked
the
petitioner.
the
general
basic
facts
of
the
confession
by
the
co-defendant
edwin
thomas
and
the
statement
by
millie
lee
is,
there
is
a
great
difference.
i
would
argue
that
there
is
no
confession
to
murder
in
millie
lee's
statement.
her
statement
only
involves
that
she
was
in
her
apartment
with
her
boyfriend,
edwin
thomas,
her
aunt
mattie
darden,
and
another
woman
by
the
name
of
odessa
harris,
and
there
had
been
some
conflicts
earlier,
but
in
an
argument
with
odessa
harris,
odessa
harris
was
leaving,
and
edwin
thomas
snuck
up
behind
her
and
stabbed
her
in
the
back.
edwin
thomas's
statement,
his
confession
says
that
millie
lee
and
odessa
harris
were
standing
in
the
kitchen
talking,
and
he
went
up
to
sneak
up
behind
her
in
the
kitchen
and
stab
her
in
the
back,
but
odessa
harris
caught
him,
and
he
had
to
wrestle
her
to
the
floor,
and
stabbed
her
in
the
chest
or
stomach
area.
there
is
a
great
difference.
the
problem
is
in
this
case
edwin
thomas's
confession
says
that
they
had
talked
for
months
about
the
problem
with
mattie
darden,
and
that
they
had
talked
about
the
need
to
kill
mattie
darden,
and
that
that
night
they
talked
about
it
and
talked
about
the
need
to
kill
odessa
harris.
there
is
no
such
admissions,
there
are
no
such
statements
in
millie
lee's
statement.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
sir.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
the
trial
counsel
does
not
make
any
objection
on
the
record,
and
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
because
trial
counsel
did
not
hear
the
statement,
was
not
listening
and
inattentive
at
that
time,
and
just
went
on
assuming
the
trial
court
judge
was
keeping
the
evidence
separate
for--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--i
am
not
sure
how
that
could
happen,
your
honor.
all
i
know
is
that
there
was
no
objection
at
that
time
during
trial.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
a
good
assumption
in
this
case.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
believe
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
is
closely
balanced,
and
is
not
clearly
showing
that
she
had...
that
the
state
proved
her
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
murder
of
odessa
harris.
you
have
to
make
a
number
of
inferences
in
the
case
to
reach
that.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
judge
had
to
reach
out
and
grab
hold
of
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
order
to
make
that.
the
trial
court
judge
was
reaching
for
something
more
solid
than
a
number
of
inferences
from
the
petitioner's
statement.
i
don't
think
that
the
trial
court
attorney,
the
attorney
for
millie
lee
at
trial
really
heard
what
the
judge
was
saying,
for
whatever
reason
which
i
don't
know.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
would
expect
that
to
occur,
and
i
could
only
speculate
as
to
why
trial
counsel
was
not
listening
at
that
time.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
really
don't
see
how
that
would
be
possible
under
illinois
law
since--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--i
really
don't
think
that's
possible,
justice
white,
since
she,
counsel
had
filed
a
motion
to
sever
when
the
jury
trial
was
still
a
possibility,
and
in
that
motion
to
sever
she
alleges
that
prejudice
would
occur
if
trial
would
be
conducted
with
the
co-defendant,
and
the
major
reason
why
prejudice
would
occur
is
because
of
co-defendant's
confession.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
from
the
record--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--from
the
record,
i
can
only
state
that
the
attorney
either
did
not
hear
it
or
was
not
paying
attention
for
some
reason
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
or
just
let
it
pass
her
by.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be
said
that
trial
counsel
at
that
time
agreed
to
let
it
go--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--because
she
also
filed
a
post-trial
motion
asking
that
a
new
trial
be
granted
in
which
counsel
again
reiterates
the
defense
of
her
client
at
trial,
which
was
that
there
was
no
intent
to
kill
based
upon
the
statement,
and
that
voluntary
manslaughter
was
also
a
possibility
as
a
verdict
due
to
the
petitioner's
statement--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--and
if
she
believed
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
admissible
and
usable
against
millie
lee,
then
there
would
be
no
need
to
put
that
into
the
post-trial
motion.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
the
trial
attorneys
indicate
that
the
motion
is
no
longer
needed
to
be
heard
because
with
a
bench
trial
the
judge
would
consider
the
evidence
separately.
the
judge
says
it
will
be
done
so.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
at
the
beginning?
mr.
dan
w.
evers
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant?
mr.
dan
w.
evers
millie
lee
is
mentioned
in
the
co-defendant's
confession.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
admittedly
they
do
not
say
on
the
record
exactly
what
the
evidence
is
that
they
are
going
to
be
keeping
separate.
they
also
conduct
during
this
joint
bench
trial
the
suppression
motion
for
both
millie
lee
and
edwin
thomas.
that
also
is
to
be
kept
separate.
the
point
is
that
they
moved,
both
edwin
thomas
and
millie
lee
moved
to
sever
their
cases
when
they
were
proposing
to
have
a
jury
trial,
and
in
millie
lee's
motion
to
sever,
it
alleges
prejudice
would
occur
if
the
co-defendant
was
tried
with
her,
and
in
that
case
the
most
prejudicial
evidence
against
millie
lee
is
the
co-defendant's
confession.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
it
would
be
possible
to--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--it
is
not
customary.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
it
may
be
possible
to
object
at
that
time,
but
it
is
not
customary,
and
as
far
as
what
was
going
on,
i
am
not
sure,
as
far
as
how
the
courtroom
scene
was
set
up.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
that
would
also
be
possible.
i
would
admit
that,
your
honor.
the
important
point,
though,
is
that
even
though
no
objection
was
made,
that
this
is
a
significant
constitutional
right,
and
one
that
implicates
a
fair
trial?
mr.
dan
w.
evers
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
did
not
talk
about
bruton.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
it
does
talk
about
the
only
evidence
against
millie
lee
is
her
statement,
and
that
her
statement
does
not
indicate
an
intent
to
kill.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
your
honor.
illinois
law
would
make
that
inadmissible,
and
from
what
occurred
at
trial,
if
millie
lee
and
edwin
thomas
had
a
jury
trial,
under
illinois
law
the
judge
would
have
been
required
to
sever
the
cases
so
that
the
confession
of
the
edwin
thomas
would
not
prejudice
millie
lee
at
the
jury
trial.
what
the
court
appears
to
be
worried
about
is
whether
there
is
waiver
of
this
constitutional
right
in
this
case,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
could
be
found
on
this
record.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
why
no
objection
was
made
at
the
time,
and
to
suggest
that
it
was
waived
would
be
waiving
out
a
significant
constitutional
right,
and
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause
was
not
suggested
by
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
appellate
court
below
or
in
this
court,
and
the
general
rule
in
illinois
is
that
any
error
made
at
a
bench
trial
is
preserved
for
appellate
review
without
filling
a
post-trial
motion.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
did
review
the
merits
of
this
case.
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
apparently
extended
the
plurality
opinion
written
by
justice
rehnquist
in
parker
versus
randolph
to
this
case
stating
that
this
was
an
interlocking
confession
case.
parker
versus
randolph
distinguished
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
bruton,
and
indicated
that
there
was
no
error
in
admitting
the
co-defendant's
confession
at
a
joint
jury
trial,
but
even
in
parker
versus
randolph
the
jury
was
instructed
by
jury
instructions
from
the
judge
that
they
were
not
to
consider
the
co-defendant's
confession
against
each
other.
in
parker
versus
randolph,
it
was
clear
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
not
to
be
used
against
the
defendant
who
it
did
not
involve,
so
i
believe
that
there
is
a
clear
constitutional
violation
here
in
that
the
trial
judge
stated
on
the
record
that
he
was
using
the
co-defendant's
confession
and
not
just
a
problem
of
prejudicing
the
jury
by
hearing
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant
and
then
being
instructed
to
disregard
it.
if
there
would
be
no
other
questions,
your
honors,
i
would
request
that
you
reverse
her
convictions
of
the
two
murders,
remand
for
a
new
trial
where
she
would
not
be
prejudiced
by
this
confrontation
clause
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
believe
that
would
be
appropriate,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
i
would
ask
for
it.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
did
not
put
it
into
the
pleadings,
because
as
i
understand
it
now
the
trial
court
judge
is
not
doing
criminal
cases
in
st.
clair
county.
but
i
would
indicate
that
it
would
not
be
proper
for
judge
hobin
to
hear
it
again.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not,
but
i
had
not
really
thought
about
that
problem
since
i
understand
that
the
trial
court
judge
was
taken
off
the
criminal
bench.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--there
are
a
number
of
illinois
supreme
court
cases
which
we
cite
in
the
reply
brief,
people
versus
clark,
people
versus
buckminister,
people
versus
eddington,
and
other
cases--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--in
a
joint
trial,
your
honor--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--that
would
be
governed
by
illinois
pattern
jury
instruction
number
3.08,
in
which
it
instructs
that
one
co-defendant's
statement
is
not
to
be
used
against
another,
and
that
is
the
standard
instruction
which
i
believe
is
also
used
in
federal
trials.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
yes,
your
honor.
illinois
pattern
jury
instruction
3.08
is
formulated
by
a
committee
formed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court
directs
them
to
draft
pattern
jury
instructions
for
use
in
illinois
trials,
and
they
adopt
them.
an
illinois
supreme
court
rule
which
i
believe
is
612,
illinois
supreme
court
rule
612
directs
the
trial
court
to
instruct
where
there
is
an
applicable
illinois
pattern
jury
instruction.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
am
not
aware
of
their
saying
that
it
is
not
admissible
as
far
as
an
illinois
supreme
court
case.
i
am
aware
of
one
case
called
people
versus
davis
in
which
there
was
a
bench
trial
with
co-defendant
confessions
and
the
trial
court
judge
in
that
case
stated
on
the
record
that
he
would
not
consider
the
most
inculpatory
parts
that
were
not
interlocking.
in
that
case,
one
co-defendant
said,
i
shot...
the
other
co-defendant
shot
the
victim,
and
the
other
co-defendant
blamed
the
other
one,
and
the
judge
said,
i
won't
consider
that
part,
but
i
will
consider
this,
and
they
said
there
was
no
reversible
error.
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
admissible.
they
did
not
say
that
it
was
proper.
they
just
said
that
under
parker
versus
randolph
and
some
other
illinois
cases,
that
it
was
not
error.
how
they
came
to
that
conclusion,
i
am
not
really
sure,
but
that
is
what
they
said.
the
state's
position
today
is
at
variance
with
what
their
position
was
in
the
response
to
the
cert
petition
filed
by
millie
lee.
in
the
response
to
the
cert
petition
the
state
conceded
that
this
was
inadmissible.
in
the
cert
petition
the
state
of
illinois
said,
"a
co-defendant's
confession
may
be
used
only
against
the
declarant,
and
the
trial
court
should
not
in
any
way
have
considered
the
co-defendant's
confession
against
the
petitioner.
"
now,
that
is
what
they
conceded
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
response.
how
they
come
into
this
court
today
and
say
that
illinois
law
would
make
this
admissible
i
don't
know.
their
brief
when
they
talk
about
illinois
law
indicates
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
may
have
some
rule
in
the
future,
but
they
do
not
cite
anywhere
in
their
brief
any
case
which
would
make
this
admissible.
and
as
far
as
what
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
decided
in
this
case,
they
implicitly
decided
that
it
was
admissible
evidence.
i
would
like
to
sure
up
and
say
that
your
honor
should
hold
this
as
a
violation
because
there
is
no
reliability
demonstrated
by
the
state
of
illinois
in
this
case
as
to
the
parts
that
the
judge
used
in
finding
millie
lee
guilty.
the
parts
that
the
judge
used
are
not
parts
corroborated
by
any
other
evidence.
your
honors
in
bruton
pointed
out
the
extreme
difficulties
and
unreliability
of
co-defendant
confessions.
justice
white
himself
pointed
out
those
problems.
these
statements
used
by
the
trial
court
judge
standing
alone
are
no
more
reliable
than
if
he
had
just
merely
said
we
plan
to
kill,
we
killed,
and
that
is
it.
instead,
he
gave
an
eleven-page
written
confession
which
is
corroborated
as
to
how
certain
events
occurred
after
the
killings
occurred,
but
as
to
how
the
killings
occurred,
there
is
no
reliability
on
the
co-defendant's
confession.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
there
are
significant
differences
in
that
millie
lee--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--bearing
on
guilt.
the
state's
position
is
based
on
their
premise
that
millie
lee's
statement
is
overwhelming
in
implicating
her
guilt,
yet
if
it
was
so
overwhelming,
why
did
the
trial
court
judge
feel
the
need
to
reach
out
and
use
the
co-defendant's
confession?
if
there
was
the
sufficient
evidence
within
the
petitioner's
statement,
there
was
no
need
to
reach
out
and
grab
hold
of
this
prejudicial
confession.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
intents
put
into
the
different
statements,
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
co-defendant's
confession
in
that
it
is
unreliable.
he
gave
the
confession
only
after
he
knew
that
millie
lee
had
given
a
statement
implicating
him
in
the
killings.
what
effect
that
had
upon
him
is
not
certain,
but
he
would
have
a
motive
for
malice,
he
would
have
a
motive
to
lie
about
millie
lee's
involvement,
whether
to
drag
her
down
or
to
take
her
and
implicate
her
more
deeply
in
the
killings,
it
is
not
certain,
but
what
is
certain
is
that
his
statements
standing
alone
as
to
how
the
killings
occurred
and
what
motivated
them
are
uncorroborated.
the
major
point
in
that
is
that
the
state
points
to
millie
lee's
statement
where
she
witnessed
the
murder
of
odessa
harris
and
then
ran
into
her
aunt's
bedroom,
was
confronted
by
a
knife,
and
she
ran
out.
now,
they
try
and
use
that
and
say
she
had
no
need
to
come
back,
voluntary
manslaughter
would
not
be
appropriate,
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
just
a
matter
of
fact.
the
point
is
that
the
judge
also
pointed
to
the
idea
in
edwin
thomas's
confession
that
he
originally
gave
millie
lee
a
knife
and
said
go
keep
your
aunt
quiet,
and
gave
her
a
knife
and
sent
her
into
the
bedroom
to
stab
here.
those
are
two
different
things.
what
happened
in
this
trial
is,
the
judge
used
that
statement
by
edwin
thomas
to
impute
her
helping,
her
aiding
in
the
killing
of
odessa
harris
to
millie
lee.
millie
lee's
statement
only
says
she
ran
into
the
bedroom.
now,
whether
she
did
that
to
aid
does
not
appear
in
her
statement.
she
may
have
been
just
running
away
in
a
slightly
shocked
manner
in
which
to
get
away
from
this
very
hideous
killing
by
edwin
thomas.
but
it
cannot
be
said
that
her
statement
reflects
that
she
was
trying
to
aid
edwin
thomas
by
stopping
mattie
darden.
that
does
not
appear.
that
is
just
speculation
brought
out
of
the
co-defendant's
confession.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
could
have
brought
edwin
thomas
in
to
testify.
the
state
could
have...
my
time
is
up,
your
honors.
i
would
ask
that
you
reverse
the
case,
please.
