mr.
evers,
may
i
go
back
for
a
minute
to
your
suggestion
that
maybe
the
lawyer
didn't
hear
what
the
judge
was
saying?
we
are
talking,
as
i
understand
it,
about
the
judge
announcing
his
ruling
and
explaining
his
reasons
for
the
ruling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
customary
in
illinois
for
a
lawyer
to
interrupt
a
judge
who
is
ruling
and
tell
him
he
object
to
the
ruling
as
it
is
being
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
possible,
but
is
that
customary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
practice
has
changed
since
i
was
there
if
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
typical
way
to
object
to
a
judge's
ruling
by
filing
a
post-trial
motion?
and
isn't
that
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case?
so
why
do
you
have
to
assume
that
the
lawyer
didn't
hear?
i
imagine
the
lawyer
has
to
be
courteous
to
the
judge.
would
it
not
also
be
a
logical
time
when
the
judge
concluded
his
statement
to
object
then
and
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
case
i
guess
the
illinois
appellate
court
did
review
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
on
that
point,
is
it
correct,
as
i
understand
your
opponent's
brief
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
did
rely
on
some
facts
that
were
in
the
co-defendant's
confession
that
were
not
in
the
petitioner's
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
correct
that
at
least
in
his
explanation
of
his
ruling,
he
did
rely
on
evidence
that
was
in
the
co-defendant's
confession
and
not
in
the
petitioner's
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
we
should
assume
that
if
he
had
been
interrupted
when
he
was
making
his
ruling,
he
would
have
placed
his
ruling
on
a
different
ground.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
are
to
follow
your
reasoning
on
the
harmless
error
point,
what
standard
of
harmless
error
should
we
announce?
do
we
have
to
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
would
have
done
that,
or
do
we
just
think
it
is
very
likely
that
he
would
have
done
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
case
states
that
harmless
error
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
our
inquiry
that
we
think
she
is
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
we
are
convinced
the
trial
judge
would
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
and
we
know
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
use
that
test,
you
don't
need
the
other
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
just
cumulative
evidence
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
should
you
bother
admitting
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
hurt
to
prosecute
her
under
your
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
also...
your
argument
on
reliability,
you
didn't
need...
you
only
needed
one
confession,
and
you
could
have
used
either
one
under
your
analysis.
you
were
free
to
use
the
co-defendant's
or
the
petitioner's.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
either
one
would
have
been
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
does
the
interlock
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
portion
of
the
confession
that
does
not
duplicate
the
other
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
wine-banks,
can
i
interrupt
with
one
question
about
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
what
extent
was
there
other
evidence
relied
upon
other
than
the
two
confessions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
all
that
evidence
admissible
against
both
defendants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
only
really
point
in
the
trial
where
there
might
have
been
some
evidence
admissible
against
one
but
not
the
other
was
the
two
confessions.
