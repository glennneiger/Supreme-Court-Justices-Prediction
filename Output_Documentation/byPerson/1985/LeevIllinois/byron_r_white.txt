justice
byron
r.
white
what
did...
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
said
by
trial
counsel
when
the
judge
revealed
that
he
was
relying
on
the
co-defendant's
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
he
assume
that
when
he
said
he
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
he
didn't
know
that
confession
was
not
admissible
against
lee.
justice
byron
r.
white
it'
sounds
like
it
is
more
possible
than
that
he
didn't
hear
what
the
judge
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
mention
the
confession,
so
the
confession
wasn't
specifically
mentioned,
because--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
the
confession
of
the
co-defendant
surely
relates
to
lee.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
makes
you
think...
the
judge
never
said
he
wouldn't
consider
the
co-defendant's
confession
against
lee.
he
never
said
that
specifically.
he
didn't
say
he
would
observe...
that
he
would
keep
the
two
confessions
separate.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
talk
about
bruton?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
specifically
that
the
co-defendant's...
did
it
call
to
the
judge's
attention
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
was
not
admissible
against
lee?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
to
the
judge,
look,
judge
you
made
a
mistake
by
considering
the
other
confession
against
lee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
heaven's
sake.
putting
justice
white's
question
somewhat
differently,
assume
that
thomas
had
been
tried
earlier
and
that
his
confession
has
been
admitted
against
him
in
that
trial.
would
the
confession
have
been
admitted
against
lee
in
a
later
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that...
and
i
suppose
this
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
a
jury
there,
and
so
roberts,
you
think,
puts
a
gloss
on
bruton?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
so
that
bruton
is
really
sort
of
beside
the
point,
you
are
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
roberts
overruled
bruton?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
weren't
interlocking
in
the
sense
that
the
said
the
same
things.
the
co-defendant's
confession
said
things
that
lee's
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you
have
already
answered
this.
did
you
say
that
if
they
are
granted
separate
trials,
that
the
co-defendant's
confession
would
have
been
admissible
against
lee?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
about
under
illinois
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
is
the
rule
in
illinois
now,
or
would
you
just
like
it
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
if
there
had
been
an
objection,
the
judge
would
have
said,
this
is
perfectly
admissible
against
lee?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
the
trial
judge
rebut
that
suggestion
by
reference
to
the
co-defendant's
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
refer
to
her
confession
for
that
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
wasn't
error
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
25
and
26
in
the
joint
appendix,
is
that
the
sole...
is
that
the
only
statement
the
judge
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
previously
you
said
you
thought
it
was
clear
under
illinois
law
that
if
there
had
been
separate
trials,
the
co-defendant's
confession
would
not
have
been
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
you
think
the
same
rule
applies
in
a
joint
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
admissible
against
the
one
defendant,
but
not
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
backed
up
by
state
supreme
court
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have...
is
there
an
illinois
case
in
which
there
was
a
bench
trial
of
two
defendants
and
it
held
that
the
confession
of
one
is
not
admissible
against
the
other?
