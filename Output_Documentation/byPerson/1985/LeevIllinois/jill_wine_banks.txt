ms.
jill
wine-banks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent's
position,
simply
stated,
is
that
there
was
no
constitutional
error
in
this
case
in
the
admission
and
use
of
the
co-defendant's
confession
against
the
defendant,
and
secondly,
that
if
there
was
any
error,
it
was
harmless.
the
tension
that
has
long
existed
between
the
use
of
hearsay
in
a
criminal
case
and
the
rights
of
confrontation
under
the
sixth
amendment
can
be
lessened
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
this
case.
the
sixth
amendment,
of
course,
does
not
bar
all
hearsay.
competing
rights
and
public
policy
interest
may
outweigh
the
defendant's
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
at
a
trial
without
any
cross
examination.
ohio
v.
roberts
establishes
a
two-pronged
test
for
determining
what
hearsay
is
admissible
without
cross
examination
and
without
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
by
applying
the
logic
and
the
sensible
principles
and
the
very
workable
guidelines
of
roberts
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
respondents
believe
that
their
position
is
supported
and
that
the
court
can
find
that
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment
were
not
violated
or
infringed
by
the
use
of
her
co-defendant's
confession
against
her
at
the
trial.
for
this
reason,
we
urge
that
no
error
be
found,
and
that
the
petitioner's
conviction
be
left
intact.
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
this
court
is
overwhelming
of
her
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
even
absent
consideration
of
the
co-defendant's
remarks.
for
this
reason,
too,
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
should
be
upheld.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
only
in
rebutting
the
petitioner's
defense
or
claimed
defense
of
self-defense,
the
judge
did
make
one
brief
reference
to
a
fact
in
the
co-defendant's
confession.
however,
in
response
to
another
question
asked
of
my
opponent,
had
there
been
an
objection
or
this
error
called
to
the
judge's
attention,
he
could
have
just
as
easily
rebutted
her
claimed
defense
on
the
basis
of
her
own
confession.
if
we
look
at
her
confession--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--in
the
statement,
absolutely,
that
is
true.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
that
is
our
secondary
argument,
yes.
our
first
argument
is
that
having
done
so,
it
was
not
error,
that
under
the--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--i
think
that
the
test
is,
would
the
case
against
petitioner
have
been
significantly
reduced
by
the
absence
of
the
co-defendant's
confession.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
in
schnable
i
believe
that
is
what
the
court
says.
but
if
you
went
on
a
harmless
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard,
i
believe
that
that,
too,
is
satisfied
because
the
evidence
against
the
petitioner
is
so
overwhelming
in
this
case,
i
do
disagree
with
my
opponent
on
that.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
her
confession
proves
that
she
has
admitted
all
of
the
elements
of
murder
of
both
odessa
harris
and
mattie
darden.
premeditation
is
total
surplusage.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
i
believe
that
you
are
free
to
look
at
the
record
and
make
a
determination
of
what
the
trial
court
judge,
what
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
would
have
concluded,
and
that
you
will
conclude
that
indeed
there
is
no...
it
would
be
a
travesty
to
reverse
this
case
where
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming,
but
it
would
also
be
wrong
to
reverse
where
under
roberts
the
evidence
is
so
reliable
that
it
was
not
error
to
use
that
evidence.
we
believe
that
rather
than
having
a
conviction
saved
by
the
harmless
error
argument
after
the
fact,
that
it
would
be
better
for
this
court
to
rule
that
it
was
admissible,
and
to
give
guidance
so
that
prosecutors
and
trial
courts
know
what
evidence
may
be
used
in
advance.
roberts
really
makes
the
touchstone
for
admissibility
reliability,
and
under
the
two-pronged
test
of
roberts
this
was
clearly
the
kind
of
reliable
hearsay
that
the
courts
have
long
regarded
as
admissible.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
i
would
go
even
further
and
say
not
only
would
this
apply
at
a
jury
trial
as
well
as
a
non-jury
trial,
but
it
would
apply
at
separate
trials.
if
our
theory
is
correct,
this
would
be
admissible
at
a
separate
trial.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
justice
white,
i
do
think
so.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
i
think
that
it
establishes
a
different
test.
i
think
perhaps
the
bruton
case
would
come
out
the
same
way
under
our
test
because
in
that
case
where
you
have
only
one
confession
and
you
have
the
overwhelming
prejudice,
if
nothing
else,
under
the
court's
inherent
power
to
keep
our
prejudicial
evidence
that
is
outweighed
because
of
its
prejudicial
effect,
that
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
bruton.
but
where
you
have
completely
interlocking
confessions,
that--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--that
is
correct,
but
although
there
has
never
been
a
clear
definition
of
what
interlocking
means,
and
indeed
if
you
read
the
cases
it
seems
as
if
wherever
there
are
two
confessions
the
courts
say
they
interlock.
i
think
that
we
could
propose
a
very
sensible
rule
defining
what
interlocking
means,
and
that
rule
would
be
one
that
says
where
the
confessions
interlock
on
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
where
they
interlock
on
the
relative
culpability
of
the
actors,
and
on
all
the
salient
facts
of
the
crimes
admitted,
that
that
is
an
interlock,
and
in
this
case
if
we
look
at
those
three
criteria,
we
will
find
that
it
is
indeed
a
fully
interlocking.
the
only--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
this
was
probably
unnecessary.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
i
think
it
is.
that
is
correct.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
i
think
that
a
prosecutor
should
not
have
the
constrictions
of
saying
that
they
may
not
use
evidence
which
may
indeed
be
necessary.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
that
is
true
by
hindsight,
but
in
the
press
of
trial,
i
know
from
having
been
both
a
trial
lawyer
and
an
appellate
lawyer,
you
look
at
the
trial
record
as
an
appellate
lawyer
and
you
say,
my
goodness,
why
did
they
do
that,
that
is
overkill,
but
in
the
press
of
the
trial
you
do
not
know
what
will
be
persuasive,
and
that
anything
that
is
reliable,
such
as
this,
should
be
admissible.
the
prosecutor
should
not
be
barred
from
using
it
just
because
it
is
unnecessary.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
that
is
correct.
they
both--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--that
is
correct.
but
because
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
in
a
one-confession
case
you
might
have
a
different
rule,
the
existence
of
the
two
confessions
does
make
a
difference,
and
here,
where
you
have
the
two
confessions
and
they
interlock,
the
reliability
is
definitely
enhanced
under
the
roberts
test.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
i
think
that
we
would
argue
that
because
a
confession,
once
it
is
deemed
to
be
interlocking
and
reliable,
the
entire
portion...
the
entire
confession,
including
the
surplusage
and
the
cumulative,
comes
in.
there
is
nothing
inconsistent,
i
should
point
out,
in
millie
lee's
confession.
she
has
not
admitted
all
of
the
facts,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
edwin
thomas's
confession
is
less
reliable.
perhaps
more
damaging,
but
not
less
reliable,
because
it
contains
more
information
than
millie
lee's.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
justice
rehnquist,
we
would
argue
that
it
comes
in
as
a
statement
against
penal
interest,
which
is
reliable
enough
to
meet
the
test
of
roberts,
which
determines,
we
believe,
when
any
type
of
hearsay
is
admitted.
there
have
been
several...
at
least
two
courts
of
appeal
have
admitted
statements
against
interest
by
accomplices
against
the
defendant,
and
have
done
so
under
the
roberts
test,
but
they
were
reliable
enough
to
be
admissible,
so
the
question
then
is,
is
a
confession
different
enough
from
other
statements
against
penal
interest
to
have
a
different
rule
apply,
and
we
would
say
that
at
least
when
there
are
interlocking
confessions
that
are
corroborated
by
other
testimonial
evidence
in
addition
to
being
corroborated
by
the
interlock,
and
are
corroborated
by
the
physical
evidence,
that
those
are
so
reliable
that
they
can
be
treated
as
our
other
statements
against
penal
interest.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
other
than
the
limitations
that
we
are
proposing,
which
is
that
it
interlocks...
if
that
was
a
single
confession,
no.
but
where
it
is
corroborated
by
all
the
other
defendants
admitting
exactly
the
same
elements
and
the
same
relative
culpability
and
the
same
facts,
yes,
that
would
be
fully
admissible.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
only
as
part
of
the
motion
to
suppress,
which
was
part
of
the
trial,
so
that
after
the
state
rested,
both
defendants
testified
on
their
suppression
hearing.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
no,
although
there
is
some
suggestion,
i
believe,
that
because
edwin
thomas
went
beyond
the
suppression
hearing,
he
was
asked,
"and
so
then
you
told
the
police
exactly
what
happened.
"
and
he
answered,
"yes".
i
believe
that
perhaps
that
goes
beyond
the
suppression--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
and
we
do
argue
in
our
brief
that
he
was
available
for
cross
examination.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
it
would
be
admissible
only
against
the
declarant
in
the
single
confession
situation,
but
there...
illinois--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--well,
there
are
two
halves
to
my
answer
to
that.
one
is
that
clearly
parker
has
been
adopted
by
or
actually
was...
preceded
parker
where
they
said
that
the
harm
of
instructions
will
be
deemed
to
not
exist
in
the
situation
of
corroborating
interlocking
confessions.
so
that
it
would
be
admissible
at
a
joint
trial
against
the
declarant.
we
believe
that
in
this--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--if
they
interlock.
yes.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
justice
o'connor,
i
am
afraid
that
illinois
has
done
no
better
than
any
other
court
in
being
specific
in
its
definition
of
interlocking.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
well,
we
know
that
they
have
adopted,
for
example,
the
chambers
standard
for
the
use
of
an
exculpatory
statement
against
penal
interest,
and
used
the
test
of
chambers
in
admitting
that
kind
of
a
statement
against
penal
interest.
we
also
know
that
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
admitted,
that
the
appellate
court
affirmed
the
conviction
without
addressing
or
at
all
looking
at
or
commenting
on
the
admissibility
question,
and
that
is
waived.
illinois
is
a
very
strict
res
judicata
state,
and--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
way
that
the
petitioner
could
get
a
hearing
on
that
issue
at
this
point
now
that
the
direct
appeal
route
is
finished.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
i
believe
right
at
the
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
statement
by
the
judge
that
he
was
using
that
one
sentence
to
rebut
her
defense.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
necessarily
been
waived.
i
think
that
there
could
have
been
a
post-trial
motion
challenging
it,
but
that
motion
was
limited--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--i
am
sorry.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
the
post-trial
motion
did
not
raise
that
issue.
the
post-trial
motion
raised
the
confrontation
issue,
which
has
been
fully
briefed
and
decided
by
the
court--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes.
the
courts
have
frequently
in
illinois,
the
appellate
courts
frequently
in
illinois
raise
sui
sponte
such
an
issue
of
admissibility
where
it
sees
a
problem.
they
did
not
see
the
problem
in
this
case.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
it
is
only
a
statement--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--in
the
transcript,
and
i
don't
have
the
page
reference,
but
i
could
provide
it
in
a
supplemental
brief,
in
the
very
first
few
pages
of
the
trial
transcript.
the
waiver
or
the
withdrawal
of
the
severance
motion
is
based
on
the
fact
that
he
will
compartmentalize
the
evidence.
there
is
absolutely
no
specific
reference
to
the
confessions.
that
is
all
that
is
said,
is
a
very
brief
remark
that
because
the
judge
can
keep
things
straight
and
separate
the
evidence
against
each,
we
will
withdraw
the
motion
now
that
we
have
a
non-jury
trial,
but
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
the
confessions,
no
specific
promise
about
the
confessions,
and
it
is
quite
obvious
when
he
is
announcing
his
verdict
that
he
has
indeed
used
to
rebut.
and
i
would
like
to
pursue
that
because
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
millie
lee's
confession,
within
the
four
corners
of
that
confession
we
have
a
full
confession
to
two
murders.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
we
also
have
within
hers
the
rebuttal
to
the
self-defense,
and
really
that
is
all
we
are
talking
about
here,
is
the
rebuttal
to
her
claim
of
self-defense.
the
reason
i
say
that
she
has
totally
admitted
to
all
the
facts
that
waive
her
self-defense
claim
is
that,
let's
take
it
from
the
point
where
after
she
runs
into
the
room
and
stabs
her
aunt,
she
then
has
disabled
her
aunt,
who
is
lying
prone,
but
still
alive.
at
that
point
her
self-defense
is
gone.
there
is
no
physical
threat
possible
from
mattie
darden
to
the
petitioner.
but
what
does
she
do
at
that
point?
she
gets
a
skillet
from
the
co-defendant
and
pounds
her
aunt
on
the
head.
the
skillet
is
hit
with
such
force
that
it
shatters,
and
so
she
sends
the
co-defendant
for
a
second
skillet,
and
again
pounds
her,
and
the
pathologist
in
the
transcript
at
pages
77
and
78
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
not
the
stab
wounds
that
killed
her
aunt,
but
that
indeed
it
was
the
blunt
blows
to
the
head
that
killed
her.
so,
the
murder
occurred
after
the
self-defense,
if
ever
there
was
one,
and
i
think
that
her
confession
even
earlier
makes
clear
there
is
none,
but
certainly
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
at
that
point,
and
illinois
case
law
on
this
is
very
clear
that
she
would
not
have
a
self-defense
left
at
that
point.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes...
no,
justice
o'connor,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
what
i
think
her
confession
viewed
alone
and
excluding
any
reference
to
the
co-defendants
shows
is
that
when
the
co-defendant
was
stabbing
odessa
harris,
she
ran
into
the
bedroom,
and
when
her
aunt
indicated
a
desire
to
help
her
friend
by
saying,
get
out
of
my
way
or
i
will
kill
you,
which
was
her
way
of
saying,
don't
stop
me
from
helping
my
friend,
what
did
she
do?
she
didn't
get
out
of
the
way.
she
got
a
knife
and
began
to
stab
her
aunt.
by
precluding
her
aunt...
i
am
not
suggesting
she
had
an
obligation
to
help
odessa,
but
she
was
guilty
by
accountability
of
murder
for
preventing
her
aunt
from
assisting
odessa
harris,
and
again,
the
cases
we
cite,
the
illinois
cases
in
our
brief
make
that
very
clear,
that
that
has
been
a
specific
holding.
where
a
defendant
prevents
assistance
from
being
rendered,
they
become
guilty
by
accountability
of
murder.
so,
i
believe
within
her
own
confession
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
she
has
admitted
to
the
murder
of
odessa
harris.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
if
i
may,
justice
powell.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
only
as
part
of
the
suppression
hearing.
neither
defendant
put
on
a
defense.
they
both
took
the
stand
after
the
state
rested
as
part
of
and
solely
for

we
believe
that
is
why
he
is
an
unavailable
witness,
but
if
he
hadn't
invoked
his
privilege,
then
he
would
have
been
available
for
cross
examination,
and
either
way,
the
availability
becomes
a
red
herring,
because
if
he
had
not
taken
the
fifth
amendment,
as
was
his
right,
then
he
would
have
been
available
for
cross
examination,
and
there
would
be
no
confrontation
clause
problem
for
this
court
to
address.
it
is
only
because
he
was
unavailable
because
of
the
existence
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
we
have
the
confrontation
question.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
one
of
the
problems
that
has
occurred
in
reading
the
cases
is
that
there
is
a
question
about
whether
a
confession
is
different
than
other
statements
against
penal
interest,
and
there
has
been
perhaps
some
argument
that
there
is
a
presumption
against
the
reliability
of
such
confessions.
while
even
if
a
rebuttable
presumption
is
warranted,
we
think
that
the
creation
as
is
suggested
by
this
case
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
that
is
not
required
by
the
sixth
amendment,
nor
is
it
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings
or
with
good
public
policy.
indeed,
a
reverse
presumption
of
trustworthiness
may
even
be
warranted.
as
this
court
said
in
california
versus
green
and
in
matlock,
a
confession
to
murder
has
its
own
indicia
of
reliability.
as
oliver
wendell
holmes
said
in
his
dissent
in
donnelly,
no
other
statement
is
so
much
against
interest
as
a
confession
to
murder.
it
is
far
more
calculated
to
convince
than
the
dying
declaration.
because
of
the
reliability
of
a
murder
confession,
especially
when
coupled
with
the
corroborative
elements
such
as
exist
in
this
case,
respondents
urge
this
court
to
find
under
roberts
that
petitioner's
co-defendant's
confession
had
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
to
be
properly
admitted
without
trial
cross
examination.
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
roberts
and
pointer,
california
versus
green,
barber
and
moates,
which
all
permitted
the
inculpatory
use
against
a
defendant
of
preliminary
hearing
testimony
where
there
was
cross
examination
of
the
declarant,
or
perhaps
even
where
there
was
only
an
opportunity
for
cross
examination
is
suggested.
it
is
also
consistent
with
dutton,
wherein
the
court
ruled
that
a
georgia
rule
of
evidence
which
permitted
a
concealment
phase
conspiracy
statement
to
be
admitted
without
violating
the
sixth
amendment,
and
with
mancusi
versus
stubbs-maddox,
which
held
the
admission
of
a
transcript
from
the
first
trial
to
be
admissible
without
violation
of
the
sixth
at
the
second
trial.
the
ruling
that
we
urge
the
court
here
to
find
is
also
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment.
according
to
parker,
the
sixth
amendment
is
intended
to
be
a
safeguard
to
ensure
the
fairness
and
accuracy
of
criminal
trials.
according
to
dutton,
the
mission
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
advance
a
practical
concern
for
the
accuracy
of
the
truth
determining
process
in
criminal
trials
by
assuring
the
trier
of
fact
a
satisfactory
basis
for
evaluating
the
truth
of
the
prior
statements.
following
the
decisions
and
logic
of
this
court's
rulings
in
roberts
and
other
cases,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
satisfactory
basis
for
evaluating
the
truth
of
the
underlying
statement,
and
at
least
two
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
ruled
that
the
admission
of
an
inculpatory
statement
against
penal
interest
is
admissible
against
a
defendant,
and
two
courts
have
ruled
that
a
co-conspirator
confession
statement
inculpating
the
defendant
is
also
admissible.
these
decisions
and
the
logic
and
policy
underlying
them
support
the
result
respondents
urge
before
this
court
today,
which
is
that
the
co-defendant's
interlocking
confession
be
included
with
other
inculpatory
statements
against
penal
interest
in
the
category
of
reliable
and
therefore
admissible
hearsay
despite
the
absence
of
cross
examination
at
the
trial.
where
the
courts
have
found
that
the
substantive
use
of
hearsay
is
permissible
against
a
defendant,
the
courts
have
said
that
although
there
is
a
preference
for
a
face
to
face
confrontation
as
a
means
of
testing
the
truth
of
the
underlying
statement,
that
right
of
cross
examination
may
be
replaced
by
other
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
result
of
our
position.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
we
believe
that
it
would
be
admissible
at
a
separate
trial
because
to
the
extent
that
this--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--well,
because
it
has
never
come
up,
of
course,
i
am
only
predicting
that
based
on
the
fact
that
illinois
has
no
codified
rules
of
evidence,
it
is
perhaps
unique
in
this
regard,
so
that
rules--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--i
think
that
the
argument
we
are
making
here
today,
had
it
been
made
before
the
trial
judge,
would
have
been
accepted
by
him,
because
illinois
has
adopted
and
shown
a
trend
to
making
its
rules
of
evidence
fully
coterminus
with
the
fullest
extent
of
the
constitutional
guarantees,
and
to
the
extent
we
think
this
is
fully
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment,
we
believe
that
the
illinois
court
would
have
even
at
a
separate
trial
had
that
been
the
case
found
this
reliable
enough
to
be
admissible.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
even
in
a
jury
trial.
like
the
cases
that
we
have
cited,
petitioner's
co-defendant's
confession
here
is
the
type
of
hearsay
that
can
be
admitted
against
a
non-declarant
in
a
criminal
trial
without
cross
examination.
the
roberts
test,
of
course,
requires
unavailability,
which
we
have
already
discussed
and
demonstrated
why
the
declarant
was
unavailable,
but
there
is
also
a
substitute
for
that,
which
is
that
the
cross
examination
would
be
of
so
little
value
that
it
is
unnecessary,
and
again
clearly
here
there
would
have
been
no
benefit
to
the
defendant
in
cross
examining
when
she
would
have
still
been
faced
with
the
admission
of
the
full
crime
in
her
own
confession.
the
other
test
in
roberts
is
that
the
evidence
be
reliable.
again,
clearly
because
of
the
nature
of
the
corroborating
evidence
outside
the
interlocking
confession
and
the
nature
of
the
interlocking
confession,
we
can
conclude
that
it
was
indeed
reliable,
and
that
the
whole
confession
should
be
admissible.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
justice
stevens.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
in
addition
to
the
two
confessions,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony.
there
was
the
testimony
of
the
store
owner
who
sold
millie
lee
the
can
of
charcoal
lighter
fluid
which
was
used
to
burn
the
bodies
and
to
dispose
of
them.
there
was
testimony
of
all
the
investigators
who
heard
the
confession
and
who
investigated,
and
who
corroborated
the
confessions
by,
for
example,
when
the
knives
were
identified,
they
were
asked,
where
are
the
knives.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
absolutely.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
that
is
correct.
absolutely.
in
any
event,
under
ohio
v.
roberts,
we
urge
that
no
constitutional
error
be
found,
and
that
alternatively
if
any
error
should
be
found,
although
the
evidence,
we
believe,
is
overwhelming,
the
error
should
be
deemed
to
be
harmless.
the
test,
we
believe,
would
be
whether
the
case
against
petitioner
would
be
significantly
less
persuasive
without
the
confession
of
her
co-defendant,
and
clearly
here
it
would
not
have
been
diminished
one
iota
because
of
the
existence
of
her
own
confession
which
fully
admits
the
guilt
for
both
murders
and
rebuts
her
only
defense.
and
i
would
point
out
that
she
only
claimed
a
self-defense
defense.
she
did
not
claim
sudden
and
intense
passion
as
a
defense.
co-defendant
claimed
that.
and
there
has
been
some
confusion,
i
believe,
in
the
record
on
that,
but
as
i
said,
in
addition
to
her
own
confession,
we
have
all
of
the
evidence
in
addition
to
that.
and
odessa
harris's
murder,
as
i
said
earlier,
is
fully
admitted,
because
all
it
requires
to
prove
her
guilt
of
that
is
that
she
intended
to
assist
or
facilitate
before
or
during
her
co-defendant's
acts,
and
on
her
own
confession,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
that
is
admitted.
she
did
admit
stopping
her
aunt
from
helping
here,
which
under
people
v.
gill
and
people
v.
richardson
is
enough
to
make
her
accountable
for
the
murder
of
odessa.
her
confession
is
also
complete
as
to
the
murder
of
her
aunt.
it
also
is
replete
with
admissions
that
rebut
her
self-defense.
having
hit
her
aunt
with
two
different
skillets
after
she
was
disabled
totally
eliminates
that
under
people
v.
thornton.
additionally,
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
has
claim
a
sudden
and
intense
passion
or
there
has
been
any
question
about
that,
by
looking
at
her
confession
we
find
that
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
to
support
that
claimed
defense,
and
therefore
once
again
her
confession
is
complete
and
leads
to
the
denial
of
her
request
here.
in
conclusion--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes,
he
did,
and
it
was
unnecessary
to
do
so,
because--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--he
did
not,
but
he
could
have,
and
for
harmless
error
purposes
that
is
what
the
test
is.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
that
is
correct,
it
wasn't
error
because
it
was
admissible
and
he
was
proper
in
using
it.
that
is
exactly
our
point,
is
that
the
constitutional
right--
ms.
jill
wine-banks
--yes,
your
honor,
this
is
the
full
announcement
of
his
verdict.
ms.
jill
wine-banks
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
right
of
the
petitioner
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
her
is
designed
to
ensure
that
the
truth
is
accurately
determined
in
a
criminal
trial.
that
right
is
fully
protected
by
the
admission
against
petitioner
of
her
co-defendant's
confession,
which
fully
interlocks
with
her
own
confession
on
every
material
element
of
the
crime
and
on
every
salient
fact.
thank
you,
your
honors.
