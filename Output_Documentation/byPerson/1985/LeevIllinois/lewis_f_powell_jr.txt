--mr.
evers,
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
trial
court
had
agreed
that
it
would
not
consider
in
response
to
the
motion
to
sever
the
evidence
introduced
by
one
party
against
the
other
party.
did
the
judge
say
that
on
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
your
position
is,
the
judge
did
agree
in
advance
that
he
would
not
consider
the
evidence
with
respect
to
thomas
in
his
consideration
of
whether
lee
was
guilty
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
will
you
clarify
some
trial
facts
for
me,
please,
ma'am?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
thomas
testify
in
his
own
defense?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
although
thomas
was
in
the
courtroom...
well,
he
was
in
the
courtroom.
was
any
effort
made
by
lee
to
put
him
on
the
stand?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
she
had
undertaken
to
use
him
as
a
witness,
he
could
have
invoked
his
privilege,
could
he
not?
