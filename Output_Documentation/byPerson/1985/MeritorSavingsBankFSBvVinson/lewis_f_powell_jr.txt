justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask,
before
you
leave
that
particular
point.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
section
in
your
complaint
do
you
rely
on
as
supporting
environmental
harassment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
in
your
complaint
that
was
filed
september
22nd,
1978?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
paragraph?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
no
mention
of
environment
in
that
paragraph.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
barry.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
whether
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
any
of
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court
were
clearly
erroneous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
do
you
consider
you
are
bound
by
all
21
of
those
findings
of
fact?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
final
finding
by
the
trial
court
was
that--
[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
the
final
finding
was
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
the
victim...
this
is
on
page
44a
of
the
petition:
"plaintiff
was
not
the
victim
of
sexual
harassment
or
sexual
discrimination.
"
that
puts
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
in
a
rather
difficult
position,
doesn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
more
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
rebuttal
testimony,
did
you
introduce
evidence
by
any
other
women
that
they
had
been
harassed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
trial
court
did
say
you
could
have
introduced
that
in
rebuttal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
whatever
the
reason,
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
we
have
only
the
testimony
of
your
client?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
only
the
testimony
of
your
client
as
to
sexual
harassment
or
as
to
the
environment.
