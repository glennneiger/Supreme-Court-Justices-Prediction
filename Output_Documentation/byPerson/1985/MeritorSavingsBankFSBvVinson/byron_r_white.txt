justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom
do
you
have
to
give
the
notice
to
be
able
to
say
the
employer
knew?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
is
that?
you
can't
just
notify
a
corporation.
you
have
to
notify
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
supervisor's
boss,
this
particular
supervisor's
boss,
he
adequate,
that
you
gave
him
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which?
what
about
in
this
particular
case?
where
would
notice
have
to
go?
you
know
your
client,
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
have
any
authority
over
the
supervisor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
officer
an
officer
of
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
agreed
with
one
of
the
submissions
of
the
bank,
namely
that
voluntariness
is
a
defense
to
a
suit
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
voluntariness
was
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
a
hostile
environment
suit
was
quite
proper,
and
it
felt
it
necessary
to
rule
on
the
voluntariness
and
the
notice
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
rulings
on
notice
and
voluntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
that
the
statute
defines
an
agent
of
an
employer
as
an
employer
himself
or
herself.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that...
all
that
means
is
there
are
two
employers
in
this
case;
one
is
taylor
and
the
other
is
the
bank.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
each
employer
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
other.
it
just
says
that
taylor
is
an
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
can
be
sued
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
why
you
think
that
notice
to
taylor
is
notice
to
another
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
of
course
the
bank
is
an
employer,
and
so
is
taylor.
but
why
do
you
conclude
that
notice
to
taylor,
who
is
an
employer,
is
notice
to
another
employer,
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you,
and
all
that
means
is
that
the
agent
is
an
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
it
means.
it
doesn't
now...
where
do
you
get
the
therefore,
that
therefore
notice
to
an
agent
is
notice
to
the
other
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
means
an
agent
is
an
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
quite
a
gloss
on
what
the
statute
says,
i
must
say.
just
you
can
sue,
and
in
this
case
you
could
sue
two
employers.
you
could
sue
taylor
and
you
could
sue
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
you
sue
them
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
reason
you
could
sue
taylor
is
not
because
he
was
an
agent
of
the
bank,
but
because
the
statute
says
you
could
sue
him
as
an
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
what
would
you
say
if
a
co-employee,
not
a
supervisor,
did
this
harassing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
isn't
the
co-employee
an
agent
of
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
couldn't
sue
a
co-employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
title
vii?
