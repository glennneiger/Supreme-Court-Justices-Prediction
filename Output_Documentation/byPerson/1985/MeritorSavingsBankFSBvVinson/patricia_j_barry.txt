ms.
patricia
j.
barry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
writ
was
improvidently
granted
and
should
be
dismissed
by
this
court.
the
bank
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
on
whether
environmental
sexual
harassment
is
prohibited
under
title
vii.
yet,
the
bank
did
not
cross-appeal
in
this
case
and
consequently
the
issue
of
whether
environmental
harassment
is
actionable
under
title
vii
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
the
trial
court
had
not
considered
this
case
under
the
legal
theory
of
environmental
sexual
harassment
and
remanded
with
directions
to
the
trial
court
to
grant
ms.
vinson
an
adjudication
of
that
claim
on
the
evidence,
as
stated
at
21a
of
the
appendix.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
i
was
the
trial
attorney.
i
took
over
at
the
stage
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
i
represented
her
at
the
trial,
which
lasted
for
eleven
days,
and
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
your
honor,
in
our
respondents'
brief
it's
cited
where
i
say
to
the
trial
court:
"your
honor,
this
evidence
is
being
presented
to
show
the
poison
environment
in
which
ms.
vinson
found
herself.
"
i
couched
it
at
that
time
"pattern
and
practice".
bundy
versus
jackson
had
not
yet
been
decided.
that
was
decided
in
january
of
1981.
we
were
conducting
this
trial
in
january
1980.
i
was
going
on
the
theory
of
the
andrus,
the
d.c.
circuit
case
of
pattern
and
practice.
that
is,
evidence
of
how
a
supervisor
treated
other
members
of
the
protected
class,
other
employees,
is
evidence
that
he
treated
this
particular
employee
in
a
discriminatory
fashion.
but
the
trial
court
repeatedly
stated:
i
only
want
to
hear
what
happened
between
ms.
vinson
and
mr.
taylor,
and
consequently
excluded
that
evidence.
it
came
in
in
a
haphazard
fashion,
but,
contrary
to
what
the
bank
argues,
in
my
opening
brief
at
pages
38
and
40
i
never
said
all
the
evidence
came
in,
but
that
that
kind
of
evidence
came
in.
it
came
in
under
a
haphazard
fashion,
and
certainly
under
no
legal
theory
of
environmental
harassment.
it
is
clear
that
the
trial
court
did
not
believe
that
such
a
cause
of
action
existed
under
title
vii.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
if
you
go
to
the
joint
complaint,
one
of
the
allegations
is
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
sexual
misconduct...
i
am
paraphrasing...
engaged
in
by
sidney
taylor,
that
the
bank
should
have
known
about
and
therefore
acquiesced
in
and
ratified.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
that's
correct,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
begging
the
court...
paragraph
14
at
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
"defendant
taylor
has
also
sexually
harassed
numerous
other
female
employees
of
the
defendant
association,
and
said
conduct
constitutes
a
well-known
pattern
of
behavior
which
has
been
known
to
the
officials
of
the
defendant
association
for
many
years
and
which
thereby
and
therefore
has
been
condoned
by
the
defendant
association.
"
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
page
20
of
the
respondents'
brief,
there
was
an
objection
sustained
to
evidence
proffered
to
show...
and
i
quote
what
i'm
saying...
"the
daily
environment
encountered
whenever
mr.
taylor
was
in
that
office.
"
and
our
citation,
justice,
is
to
the
transcript
of
january
23rd,
volume
3,
page
4.
thus,
we
have
no
factual
record
made
by
the
trial
court
on
the
specific
legal
theory
of
environmental
sexual
harassment.
this
court
has
ruled
in
tacon
versus
arizona,
410
u.s.
at
352,
that
issues
not
raised
by
the
petitioner
below
would
not
be
ruled
on
by
this
court
for
the
first
time,
and
dismissed
the
writ
of
cert
as
improvidently
granted.
thus,
because
we
are
on
remand
with
no
final
judgment
issued
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
finding
on
the
existence
of
harassment
is
that
there
was
none
at
this
point.
yet,
petitioner
would
have
the
court
rule
on
employer
liability
without
the
trial
court
considering
and
ruling
on
whether
environmental
sexual
harassment
exists
in
this
case.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
your
honor,
the
question
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
of
environmental
harassment.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
trial
court
now
understands
that
what
ms.
vinson
saw
being
done
to
the
other
women,
what
she
understood
being
done
to
the
other
women
before
she
was
made
the
demand
of
intercourse,
the
trial
court
might
just
likely
recast
its
findings
of
fact
and
determine
that
perhaps
this
aspect
of
voluntariness
was
no
longer
there.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
it
did
in
the
way
that
the
trial
court
captioned
its
findings
of
fact.
it
found
it
very
ambiguous,
because
it
was
cast
in
a
hypothetical
finding
of
fact.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
that's
right.
with
respect
to
the
voluntariness,
i
think
the
concern
was
it
was
unclear
to
them
whether
the
trial
court
was
considering
whether
the
fact
that
there
appeared
to
be
merely
an
acquiescence,
is
that
what
the
trial
court
meant
by
voluntariness.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i'm
certainly
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
position
on
notice.
i
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
position
on
voluntariness
if
it
means
that,
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying,
that
the
trial
court
had
to
find
something
more
than
the
fact
there
was,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
first
act
testified
to,
no
act
of
violence
involved.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
that
again
i
think
goes
back
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
trying
to
say.
the
decisional
law
uses
as
a
term
of
art
unwelcomeness
or
welcomeness.
it
does
not
talk
about
voluntariness,
because
then
you
get
caught
up
in
this
word
game
of,
does
it
mean
like,
because
she
acquiesced,
therefore
she's
capitulated
her
right
to
later
legal
redress?
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
it
specifically
states
in
part
of
its
opinion
that
the
touchstone
of
this
cause
of
action
has
to
be
that
the
nature
of
the
advances
are
unwelcome.
and
with
respect
to
that
prima
facie
case,
it's
well
articulated,
set
out
in
henson
at
682
fed.
second
at
903-904--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--your
honor,
justice
rehnquist,
with
respect
to
evidence
of
the
dress,
evidence
of
the
dress
by
itself
without
anything
more
does
not
make
it
more
likely
or
less
likely
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
that
she
welcomed
the
advances
of
the
supervisor.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
that
dress
by
itself
is
so
subjective,
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
has
little
probative
value.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
has
probative
value,
the
federal
court
has
full
authority
to
control
the
admission
of
evidence
through
rule
4--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--and
did
so,
created
such
prejudice
that
he
never
got
to
the
primary
fact-finding
responsibility
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist.
he
became...
the
court
of
appeals
surmised
that
perhaps
the
trial
court
did
become
highly
prejudiced
by
this
evidence
that
it
found
inadmissible
to
the
primary
fact,
that
is
were
there
sexual
advances
made
and
were
they
unwelcome;
that
he
never
determined
whether
in
fact
there
was
the
act
of
intercourse,
whether
these
advances
were
made.
we
have
to
keep
in--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--justice
rehnquist,
what
i'm
saying
to
you--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
okay,
what
i
am
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
evidence
of
dress
by
itself
standing
alone
is
not
admissible
in
a
case
involving
sexual
harassment.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
if
we're
talking
about
work
place
conduct
is
a
sexual
harassment
case,
the
california
rules
of
evidence...
i
think
it's
1103
or
1105...
provides
an
excellent
guidance,
and
it
would
be
a
good
guidance
for
a
federal
court
to
follow
in
making
rules
of
evidence.
work
conduct
related
to
the
alleged
perpetrator
is
relevant.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
no,
it
did
not,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
unless
this
court
determines
that
it
would
like
to
review
the
full
record
and
order
the
production
of
the
trial
transcript.
justice,
i
tried
on
four
occasions
to
obtain
the
trial
transcript.
i
was
without
funds.
my
client
was
without
funds.
of
course
the
trial
transcript
is
very
important
on
making
a
rule
52
challenge,
and
i
could
not
do
so
because
we
were
without
funds
and
the
trial
court
determined
that
this
case
would
not
make
any
substantial
law.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
so
we
didn't
get
the
trial
transcript.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
justice,
i
don't
think
it
does,
because
the
trial
court
at
44a
of
the
appendix
makes
it
very
clear
what
in
its
mind
constitutes
sexual
harassment,
and
the
trial
court
says:
"it
is
without
question
that
sexual
harassment
of
female
employees
in
which
they
are
asked
or
required
to
submit
to
sexual
demands
as
a
condition
to
obtain
employment...
as
a
condition
to
obtain
employment...
or
to
maintain
employment
or
to
obtain
promotions
falls
within
the
protection
of
title
vii.
"
he
was
thinking
of
the
positive
aspects
of
employment,
keeping
your
job,
getting
those
promotions.
he
obviously,
that
is
the
trial
court,
and
for
good
reason...
the
guidelines
had
not
yet
come
out;
they
came
out
in
april
of
'80,
he
decided
this
case
in
january
of
'80,
and
bundy
had
not
been
decided.
so
he
was
not
thinking
in
terms
of,
well,
what
about
noxious
environment,
poisoned
with
sexual
innuendoes,
insults,
aggressive
behavior
that
was
unwanted,
that
in
this
case
let
to
a
constructive
discharge.
but
of
course,
we're
not
saying
that
one
need
prove
economic
injury,
only
psychological
injury
of
a
sort
that
creates
an
environment
that
is
all-pervasive.
we're
not
saying
that
it's
only
one
isolated
act.
we
agree
with
henson
in
its
prima
facie
case
that
the
employee
has
a
duty
to
show
that
it
was
environmental
harassment,
justice.
and
for
those
reasons,
i
am
of
the
belief
that,
now
that
the
trial
court
has
instructions
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider
this
case
under
the
theory
of
environmental
harassment...
that
is,
gets
the
whole
picture...
he
will
recast
his
findings
of
fact.
we
will
ask
him,
please
make
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
credibility.
mr.
taylor
said
nothing
happened,
and
the
trial
court
never
made
that
finding
of
fact.
my
client
said
something
happened
and
that
it
was
very
bad.
so
we
just
don't
have
an
issue
of
the
supervisor
coming
forward
and
saying
that
there
was
a
consensual
relationship.
that's
not
what
was
said
in
this
case.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i
did
not
present
that
at
that
time.
certainly
if
a
trial
court
tells
me
that
i
can
put
on
some
evidence
that
i
couldn't
before,
i
would
do
it.
we
did
not
have
the
money
to
recall
these
women.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
in
the
rebuttal,
but
there
would
be
no
purpose
because,
unless
the
defendant,
either
one
of
the
defendants
or
both
of
them,
was
putting
on
a
case
of
environmental
harassment,
it
would
not,
even
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
be
proper
rebuttal.
as
i
understand
rebuttal
testimony,
it
has
to
be
to
controvert
that
which
the
defendant
has
said
or
to
controvert,
in
a
title
vii
case
under
aukens,
to
show
the
proper,
legitimate,
non-discriminatory
reasons
for
the
alleged
discrimination
was
pretextual.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
you're
saying
that
is
lodged
with
the
court?
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
we
have
that
transcribed,
because
that's--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
justice.
and
for
that
reason,
it
may
be
well
that
this
go
back
on
remand
so
that
all
of
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
women
can
be
considered,
and
then
if
an
appeal
is
taken,
somehow
get
the
money
together
to
get
the
full
trial
transcript.
we
are
at
a
very
complete
disadvantage,
because
in
that
eleven
day
bench
trial
there
was
testimony
presented
by
a
number
of
women
for
different
evidentiary
reasons
that
the
trial
court
never
discussed
in
its
findings
of
fact.
now,
the
court
wishes
to...
has
emphasized
in
its
opening
brief
that
we
never
raised
the
evidence
question
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
completely
correct.
this
issue
of
evidence
and
dress
is
now
before
this
court
without
also
having
been
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
it
did,
without
it
being
briefed
by
either
the
bank
or
myself.
i
made
comments
because
i
considered
it
to
be
a
form
of
sexual
character
assassination.
and
going
back
to
the
earlier
question
of
justice
o'connor,
what
about
the
work
place
conduct,
that
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
could
be
admitted
by
the
defendant
under
aikens
saying:
look
here,
there
was
a
consensual
relationship,
but
she
welcomed
it,
and
i'm
going
to
show
it
by
the
way
she
acted
towards
the
alleged
perpetrator.
what
we
have
here
is
what
we
call
general
character
evidence.
and
it
was
not
ever
properly
proffered
under
608(b).
you
cannot
present
specific
acts
of
conduct
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
a
witness
by
extrinsic
evidence.
you
have
to
ask
the
person
directly
and
you're
estopped
there.
they
never
even
asked
my
client,
ms.
vinson,
whether
she
wore
these
kinds
of
clothing.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
frown
on
using
general
character
evidence
as
proof
that
that
person
acted
in
conformity
with
that
character
at
a
specific
time,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
evidence
was
designed
to
do.
this
is
not
the
case
of
conduct
towards
the
alleged
perpetrator.
nobody
said,
justice
rehnquist,
that
she
had
those
conversations
in
front
of
mr.
taylor,
or
that
she
directed
them
to
mr.
taylor.
and
most
importantly,
they
don't
even
deal
with
mr.
taylor.
and
most
importantly,
they
do
not
deal
with
her
sexual
conduct
with
another
person,
but
what
she
said
she
fantasized
about
sexual
conduct
with
another
person
unrelated
to
the
work
site.
it
has
absolutely
no
relevancy
as
a
determination
of
whether
there
were
advances
made
by
mr.
taylor,
which
the
bank,
mr.
burton,
denied
were,
which
ms.
mccullugh
denied
were
made,
and
which
mr.
taylor
denied
were
made,
and
that
she
welcomed
them.
how
a
person
having
a
sex
fantasy
about
an
individual
totally
unrelated
to
the
work
site...
it
is
not
alleged
or
said
that
she
made
that
statement
about
the
sex
fantasy
to
the
alleged
perpetrator,
in
this
case
the
supervisor,
or
that
the
content
of
the
fantasy
dealt
with
the
supervisor.
and
for
that
reason,
it
would
constitute
general--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--justice
rehnquist,
it
would
be
analogous,
for
example,
in
a
rape
case
the
trier
of
fact
certainly
would
not
permit
the
defendant
to
present
evidence
of
how
the
victim
dressed
to
prove
the
issue
of
consent.
likewise
it
should
be
in
a
sexual
harassment
situation.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
in
terms
of
that
they
could
present
evidence
of
how--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--well,
justice
rehnquist,
the
evidence
of
dress
is
so
subjective
and
has
so
much
to
do
with
so
many
other
factors
other
than
proving
that
that
particular
individual,
that
woman,
consented
to
the
advances.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
justice
rehnquist,
just
once
more,
just
alluding
to
the
california
rules
of
evidence--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--yes,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes.
i
was
just
saying
that
the
analogy
would
be
that
the
federal
courts
do
have...
can
control
this
kind
of
evidence
relating
to
the
general
sexual
character
of
the
victim.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
and
for
that
reason
we're
arguing
that
in
this
particular
case,
because
of
what
i've
just
argue
to
you,
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
wholly
irrelevant.
again,
i
would
like
to
say
we're
not
saying
you
cannot
exclude
evidence
of
how
she
comported
herself.
but
in
this
case
the
environment
was
the
supervisor.
therefore,
how
she
conducted
herself
towards
the
supervisor
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
would
be
directly
relevant
and
on
point.
and
in
fact,
the
trial
court
said
over
and
over
again
that,
i
want
to
hear
what
happened
between
ms.
vinson
and
mr.
taylor.
and
only
when
they
brought
in
this
general
sexual
character
evidence
did
he
say
that
now
a
very
broad-based
kind
of
evidence
would
be
allowed
to
come
in.
but
also
underlying
that
assumption,
as
i
understand
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
evidence
is
being
proffered
for
two
reasons:
either
because
she
fantasized
the
charges,
which
is
the
bank's
position
and
mr.
taylor's
position,
the
acts
never
occurred;
or
it's
evidence
that,
in
case
you
decide
to
believe
her
that
something
happened,
that
she
volunteered
to
it.
so
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
just
not
alternative
pleadings,
but
alternative
proof
of
facts.
it
either
has
to
go
in
on
one
theory
or
it
has
to
go
in
on
the
other,
and
they
have
argued
in
their
brief
on
both
theories.
now,
if
they're
saying
that
this
was
evidence
of
voluntary
work
place
conduct
that
proved
that
the
relationship
was
a
consensual
one,
then
what
they're
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
their
own
supervisor
committed
perjury
in
a
court
of
law.
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
to
lock
carefully
at
this
evidence,
because
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
was
right,
the
trial
court
used
that
evidence,
as
it
say,
to
jump
the
gun
and
say,
well,
whatever
happened,
it
had
to
be
voluntary
and
i
don't
really
care
what
happened.
it's
very
important
in
this
case
to
determine
what
happened,
and
if
we're
allowed
to
go
back
on
remand
that
would
be
the
first
responsibility
of
the
trier
of
fact,
to
determine
who
is
credible
in
this
case,
who
is
telling
the
truth
with
respect
to
the
most
important
issue:
was
it
mr.
taylor
or
was
it
ms.
vinson?
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
with
respect
to
notice,
we
rely
on
the
definition
of
employer
set
out
in
section
701(a),
which
talks
about
an
employer
is
a
person,
which
is
anyone
engaged
in
commerce
and
employing
so
many
employees,
and
an
agent
of
that
employer.
that
is
to
say,
for
purposes
of
title
vii
liability
there
is
no
imputation
of
notice.
sidney
taylor
becomes
the
bank
because
he
is
a
supervisor.
now,
in
the
definitions
there
is
no
direct
reference
of
supervisor.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
excuse
me,
justice?
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
because
the
conditions
of
being
out
there
was,
like
i
have
the
power
to
hire
you,
i
have
the
power
to
fire
you.
it
was
under
the
conditions
of
being
the
supervisor
of
ms.
vinson
that
he
extracted
this
sexual
favor
from
her,
and
it
was
only
because
he
was
the
supervisor,
it
was
only
because
he
was
the
bank
at
the
northeast
branch,
that
he
was
able
to
accomplish
this.
and
for
that
reason,
when
they
say
we
have
to
have
notice,
notice
to
sidney
taylor
when
she
told
him
to
stop
doing
these
things
was
sufficient
notice
to
the
bank.
also--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--and
it
is
the--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--that's
right,
justice.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
the
employer
in
the
sense
of
being
the
collective
entity,
the
bank.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
because--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--well,
the
statute
says
that
the
definition
of
employer
shall
include
the
agent,
and--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--that's
correct,
and
therefore--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--well,
it
says
that
the
employer
is
the
person,
the
employer
is
the
agent.
so
that
when
you--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--yes.
and
so
you--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--all
right.
and
so
you
have
a
collective
entity
called
the
bank,
made
up
of
individuals
who
perform
the
functions
on
behalf
of
this
collective
entity.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
in
fact--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--yes.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
but
for
purposes
of
title
vii
liability
the
courts
have
routinely
held
that
the
collective
entity,
which
would
be
meritor
bank
in
this
case,
justice,
would,
if
there
were
discriminatory
intent
and
a
discriminatory
act
proven
on
the
part
of
sidney
taylor,
the
supervisor,
then
the
collective
entity
becomes
liable.
and
that's
important,
justice,
because
we--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--then
the
issue
of
notice
would
come
into
operation.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
no,
either
under
title
vii
definitions
or
even
under
principles
of
traditional
common
law
concepts
of
principal-agency
doctrine,
that
just
wouldn't
operate.
the
theory...
there
was
a
public
policy,
there's
good
public
policy
interests
underwriting
title
vii.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
you
could.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i'm
sorry.
you
can't
sue.
you
can
sue
the
employer
for
title
vii
violations
if
a
co-worker
engaged
in
acts
of
environmental
harassment,
provided
notice
is
given
to
the
employer.
what
is
the
difference
in
this
case
and
there
the
cutoff
is
is
the
theory
is
that
the
bank
or
any
employer
is
in
the
best
position
to
control
the
actions
of
the
supervisors.
they
don't
have
that
same
kind
of
control
over
co-workers.
they
can
discipline
supervisors,
they
can
send
them
to
seminars.
they
can
do
all
of
these
kinds
of
things.
and
by
the
way,
in
title
vii
law
the
cases
or
the
courts
called
upon
to
construe
title
vii
liability
with
respect
to
the
discriminatory
actions
of
a
supervisor
have
uniformly
held
that
the
defendants
are...
that
the
defendant
employer
becomes
necessarily
responsible
for
actions
of
all
of
its
employees
in
expressing
or
carrying
out
feelings
of
hostility
towards
women,
but
the
defendant
is
responsible
for
acts
of
supervisory
personnel.

ms.
patricia
j.
barry
chief
justice,
i
would
doubt
that
to
be
the
case,
because
there
we
can
distinguish
that
particular
hypothetical
from
the
instant
one.
here
we're
dealing
with
the
employer-employee
relationship,
and
with
respect
to
the
northeast
branch
of
the
meritor
bank
or
capital
city
mr.
taylor
was
the
bank
for
purposes
of
establishing
the
employer-employee
relationship.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
all
right.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i'm
sorry,
i
had
it
covered
up.
