justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
troll,
can
a
supervisor
who
is
not
an
employer
be
made
a
defendant
in
a
title
vii
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
a
supervisor
who
was
not
an
employer
could
be
named
as
a
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
supposing
that
in
this
case
ms.
vinson
had
simply
decided
to
bring
a
title
vii
action
against
the
supervisor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
do
not
have
to
be
an
employer
in
your
view
to
be
named
a
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
supposing
you
had
just
a
common
law
fraud
action,
where
your
fraud
required
intent
to
deceive.
now,
a
salesman
for
the
corporation,
if
that
salesman
has
intent
to
deceive,
couldn't
the
corporation
be
held
liable
even
though
you
couldn't
show
that
the
board
of
directors
know
about
the
salesman's
intent
to
deceive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
hard
to
reconcile,
ms.
barry,
with...
your
view
of
the
unwelcomeness,
with
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
that
evidence
of
the
complaining
employee's
work
place
dress
and
voluntary
conduct
couldn't
be
admitted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
is
that
for
you
as
a
lawyer
to
say,
that
no
finder
of
fact
could
find
that
relevant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
controlled
it
by
letting
it
in.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say,
then,
that
evidence
of
the
complaining
employee's
work
place
dress
and
voluntary
conduct
is
not
admissible
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
thing
was
unwelcome?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
or
are
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
question,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
use
that
sort
of
evidence
as
impeaching
evidence.
you
can
use
it
as
evidence
from
which
a
trier
of
fact
can
deduce
a
relevant
fact,
not
just
as
impeaching
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
in
a
bench
trial
has
a
great
deal
of
latitude
in
deciding
what
kind
of
evidence
it's
admitting.
and
i
think
the
standards
you're
setting
up
are
far
more
restrictive
than
any
decision
that's
ever
come
out
of
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
entirely
sure
you're
correct.
i'm
not
sure
the
cases
support
you
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
civil
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
may
be
a
good
argument
to
make
to
the
district
court.
but
after
the
district
court
has
resolved
it
against
you,
with
all
the
discretion
that
a
district
court
has
in
admitting
evidence
in
a
bench
trial,
i
just
don't
think
you're
going
to
win
in
many
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
it's
a
very
unusual
that
you
won
in
this
particular
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
governed
by
the
california
rules
of
evidence,
ms.
barry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
practicing
under
federal
rules
of
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
district
court
did
exercise
some
control.
he
admitted
it.
