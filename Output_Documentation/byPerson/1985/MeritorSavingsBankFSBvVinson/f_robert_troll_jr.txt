mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
corporate
employer
is
automatically
liable
under
title
vii
for
a
supervisor's
sexual
advances
toward
a
subordinate
even
though
the
employer
did
not
know
about
the
advances
and
never
had
a
chance
to
stop
them.
the
district
court,
after
taking
eleven
days
of
evidence,
found
that
the
employee
had
suffered
no
title
vii
discrimination
and
it
rendered
judgment
against
her.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
bank
had
no
notice
of
the
supervisor's
alleged
discrimination
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
liable
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
let
me
turn
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
proceeding.
ms.
vinson,
plaintiff
in
this
case,
went
to
work
as
a
teller
trainee
at
one
of
the
bank's
branch
offices
in
september
1974.
over
the
next
four
years,
she
was
promoted
to
teller,
head
teller,
and
finally
to
assistant
branch
manager.
it
was
undisputed
at
trial
that
these
promotions
were
based
on
merit.
ms.
vinson's
immediate
supervisor
throughout
this
period
was
sidney
l.
taylor.
mr.
taylor
was
the
branch
manager
and
an
assistant
vice
president.
at
trial
ms.
vinson
claimed
that
she
and
mr.
taylor
began
a
sexual
affair
in
may
1975,
to
which
she
consented
out
of
fear
of
losing
her
job.
she
claimed
that
for
the
next
two
and
one-half
years
mr.
taylor
repeatedly
demanded
sex
from
her
and
otherwise
harassed
her
physically
and
verbally.
but
she
admitted
that
she
never
complained
to
the
bank
about
mr.
taylor,
even
though
she
herself
was
a
supervisory
employee
and
had
regular
contact
with
higher
bank
officers.
mr.
taylor
denied
having
a
sexual
relationship
with
her,
and
he
further
denied
all
of
her
accusations
of
harassment.
he
offered
evidence
that
just
before
ms.
vinson
left
the
bank
and
filed
this
lawsuit
that
they
had
had
a
continuing
dispute
about
her
failure
to
carry
out
his
instructions
to
train
a
new
teller.
the
bank
showed
that
it
had
a
written
policy
expressly
prohibiting
sex
discrimination
and
had
appointed
one
of
its
senior
officials
as
its
eeo
officer
to
enforce
the
non-discrimination
policy.
it
also
had
a
written
grievance
procedure
for
resolving
employee
complaints.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
he
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
no,
we
have
not.
we
have
represented
strictly
the
bank
in
all
proceedings
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
although
i
don't
think
it's
part
of
the
record,
it
is
my
understanding
that
he
is
still
employed
with
the
bank
and
is
still
at
the
branch
premises
where
the
alleged
incidents
occurred.
the
bank
denied
that
ms.
vinson
or
anyone
else
had
ever
complained
about
any
harassment
or
any
other
discriminatory
activity.
the
bank
also
showed
that
ms.
vinson
had
been
offered
routine
transfers
away
from
mr.
taylor
to
other
bank
departments,
but
that
she
had
turned
these
down.
judge
penn
found
that
ms.
vinson's
participation
in
any
sexual
affair
with
her
supervisor,
if
indeed
there
was
one,
was
voluntary
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
employment.
in
so
finding,
judge
penn
necessarily
disbelieved
her
testimony
about
mr.
taylor's
harassment
and
coercion.
in
fact,
the
court
pointedly
referred
to
testimony
from
one
of
ms.
vinson's
own
witnesses,
a
co-worker,
who
said
that
ms.
vinson
did
not
appear
to
be
afraid
of
mr.
taylor.
judge
penn
also
expressly
found
that
the
bank
was
without
notice
of
any
sexual
improprieties.
the
court
said...
and
i'm
reading
from
judge
penn's
findings:
"the
alleged
sexual
harassment
involving
mechelle
vinson
was
not
reported
by
her
or
by
anyone
on
her
behalf
to
the
police
or
to
any
officials
at
the
association.
"
and
he
also
said:
"mechelle
vinson
never
filed
an
informal
or
formal
grievance
against
defendant
sidney
l.
taylor,
pursuant
to
the
association's
employee
manual.
"
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
not
only
support,
but
indeed
compel,
the
conclusions
both
that
ms.
vinson
was
not
the
victim
of
sexual
harassment
and
that
the
bank
could
not
be
liable
for
mr.
taylor's
conduct
without
having
been
placed
on
some
form
of
notice.
despite
these
findings,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
on
three
grounds.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
trial
court
failed
to
consider
whether
the
employee
had
a
claim
based
on
a
sexually
offensive
work
environment,
even
though
she
lost
no
promotions
or
other
job
benefits.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
evidence
of
the
employee's
own
voluntary
sexual
behavior
at
work
should
not
have
been
admitted
at
trial.
third
and
most
unsettling,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
an
innocent
employer
is
liable
automatically
for
a
supervisor's
sexual
conduct.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
would
concede,
your
honor,
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
before
judge
penn,
of
course,
that
theory
of
law
had
not
been
applied
to
sexual
harassment
cases.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
agree
that
he
did
not.
however,
i
would
hasten--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--as
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief,
if
the
employee
has
sustained
some
form
of
tangible
job
detriment
we
feel
indeed
it
would
be
cognizable.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
they
do
in
fact
suggest
that,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
if
there
is
some
form
of
tangible
job
benefit
over
and
above
pure
psychological
or
emotional
harm,
that
yes,
there
would
indeed
exist
such
a
claim.
but
in
analyzing
that
particular
issue
in
the
case,
it
appears
to
us,
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
that
congress
was
concerned
with
tangible
economic
loss,
not
with
psychological
or
emotional
injury.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
would
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
reasoned
argument
could
be
made
contrary
to
our
position.
simply
put,
we
felt
that,
because
this
court
had
never
before
considered
the
issue,
because
the
legislative
history
did
not
address
psychological
or
emotional
harm
but
only
tangible
economic
loss,
that
that
matter
should
be
raised
as
it
was.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
the
court
of
appeals
secondly
said
that
evidence
of
the
employee's
own
voluntary
sexual
behavior
at
work
should
not
have
been
admitted.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
for
ordering
a
remand
in
this
case.
a
remand
is
pointless
and
unnecessary.
first,
the
one
to
one
sexual
relationship
and
harassment
ms.
vinson
alleged
in
this
case,
even
if
true,
is
not
a
condition
of
employment
under
title
vii.
therefore,
there
is
no
need
for
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
trial
judge
for
further
consideration.
second,
regardless
of
whether--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--under
the
allegations
in
this
case
of
a
one
to
one
sexual
relationship,
where
the
employee
has
remained
in
the
environment
for
over
a
period
of
four
years,
we
submit
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
i'm
not
denying
that
there
can
be
such
a
case.
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
our
argument
that
the
employee
suffered
no
tangible
job
loss
whatsoever,
that
she
suffered--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--it
would
be
our
feeling
that
if
there
was
psychological
harm
or
emotional
disturbance
as
a
result
of
this
conduct,
that
it
would
in
fact
constitute
a
state
tort
remedy
and
that
would
be
where
this
employee
would
seek
relief.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
in
order
to
measure,
in
order
to
show
what
exactly
occurs.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
no,
she
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
the
facts
of
this
record
indicate
that
the
respondent
here
filed
this
lawsuit
before
she
became
unemployed.
she
then
called
in
sick
the
following
day,
indicated
she
would
be
on
indefinite
sick
leave,
and
she
thereafter
failed
to
return
to
her
employment.
and
some
60
days
later,
she
sent
a
letter
saying
she
resigned
due
to
harassment,
on
the
same
date
a
letter
had
been
sent
to
her.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
the
point
is
the
bank
was
never
notified.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
reading
the
statute,
of
course,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
it
requires
intentional
discrimination.
we
feel
that
the
clearest
indication
of
intent,
an
intend
to
discriminate,
comes
from
a
notice
and
opportunity
to
cure
rule,
which
clearly
demonstrates
what
the
employer's
intent
is.
we
read
it
therefore
out
of
the
intentional
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
is
our
opinion
that
any
form
of
notice
will
suffice
if
in
fact
the
notice
is
given
to
an
employee
internally
of
sufficient
authority
to
control
the
situation,
to
stop
the
harassment
in
its
tracks.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
had
notice
once
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
don't
necessarily
distinguish
between
the
two,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
a
notice
requirement,
at
least
in
this
case,
is
absolutely
essential.
in
a
quid
pro
quo
case,
however,
of
course,
a
supervisor
may
act
with
the
authority
actually
vested
in
it
by
the
employer
in
making
an
employment
decision
about
an
employee.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
the
problem
is
is
that
in
one
case
the
intent
of
the
employer
can
be
measured,
whereas
in
the
other
it
cannot
unless
there
is
in
fact
notice
to
the
employer.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
particular
problem
here
is
that
the--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--the
employer
here
has
in
no
way
authorized
supervisory
personnel
to
harass
its
other
subordinate
employes,
such
that
under
an
agency
concept
the
acts
of
the
supervisor
would
be
outside
the
scope,
actual
or
apparent,
of
the
supervisor,
and
title
vii
would
probably
not
impose
any
liability.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
imposes
a
direct
form,
rather
than
an
indirect
form,
of
liability.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
i
think
that
the
employee
then
has
a
duty
to
go
forward
to
someone
at
the
employer
and
to
notify
the
employer.
once
that
notice
is
received
by
the
employer,
the
employer
i
feel
then
has
a
duty
to
investigate
and,
if
it
in
fact
determines
that
the
employee
was
discharged
for
a
discriminatory
reason,
to
stop
the
discrimination,
to
take
prompt
action
to
correct
the
problem.
it
is
our
position
in
a
case
such
as
this
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
defendant
knew
about
the
offensive
environment
and
had
a
chance
to
correct
it
before
that
defendant
can
be
held
liable.
our
position
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
furthers
the
objective
of
title
vii
and,
above
all,
it
is
fair.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
it
is
our
understanding
that,
under
the
definitional
section
of
the
statute,
an
agent
of
the
employer
could
include
a
supervisor.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
you're
saying
is
not
an
employer.
you
mean
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
that
is
our
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor;
that
would
be
perfectly
within
the
statute
and
within
its
meaning.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
would
be
our
feeling.
let
me
begin
with
the
statute.
section
706(g)
requires
a
finding
that
a
defendant
intentionally
engaged
in
the
unlawful
employment
practice.
intent
presupposes
knowledge
or
at
least
reason
to
know.
when
a
corporation
is
the
defendant,
how
does
the
fact
finder
determine
corporate
intent,
as
he
is
obligated
to
do
under
the
statute?
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
it
would
depend
upon,
i
think,
some
further
circumstances:
the
scope
of
the
authority
actually
vested,
the
scope
of
the
apparent
authority
of
the
salesman.
and
in
fact,
there
is
absolutely
no
apparent
or
real
authority
to
harass
fellow
employees.
it's
clear
that
the
supervisor
is
there
for
the
purpose
of
supervising
employees,
not
harassing
them.
that
is
not
what's
intended
by
the
employer
in
the
common
law
setting.
and
if
in
fact
there
is
an
intentional
tort,
if
you
will,
committed,
the
employer
may
well
not
be
liable.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
well,
under
the
eeoc
guidelines
there
would
have
to
be
notice
in
that
case,
and
it
would
be
my
feeling
that,
if
the
supervisor
was
charged
with
responsibility,
as
he
would
be,
with
maintaining
a
good
working
environment,
you
couldn't
determine
the
corporate
intent,
however,
unless
one
of
those
employees
complained
above
the
supervisor.
there'd
be
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
there
would
be
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
employer
intended
until
the
employer
knew
what
was
going
on.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
there
are
several
cases--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--there
are
several
cases
of
that
ilk.
a
close
examination
also
shows
in
those
cases
that
some
form
of
management
knew
about
what
was
going
on
and
failed
to
stop
the
harassment.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
would
submit
that
the
majority
of
those
cases
do
involve
employer
toleration
of
a
condition.
that
of
course
is
not
our
case
here.
the
employer
did
not
tolerate
any
form
of
working
environment.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
as
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion,
some
of
that
form
of
evidence
was
allowed
in
in
the
plaintiff's
case
in
chief,
some
of
it
was
not.
but
the
plaintiff
here
concedes,
and
conceded
before
the
lower
court,
that
that
case...
that
evidence
came
in
in
this
case,
albeit
haphazardly
and
in
unplanned
fashion.
but
there
was
an
express
concession
that
it
came
in.
the
reason
why
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
that
did
or
did
not
come
in
are
the
ultimate
two
legal
defenses
that
the
bank
has
in
this
case:
first,
that
this
was
a
voluntary
relationship,
indicating
that
the
advances
were
welcomed
by
the
plaintiff,
they
were
not
unwelcome;
and
secondly,
in
any
event,
the
bank
was
without
any
notice
whatsoever
of
this
environmental
problem
if
in
fact
there
was
one.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
think
and
we
submit
that
internally
notice
should
go
to
someone
with
requisite
authority--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--well,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--at
some
point
in
time
you
would
reach
a
corporate
level--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
notice
should
have
gone
to
the
eeo
officer,
with
whom
the
plaintiff
had
frequent
contact.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
she
had
discussions
with
him.
the
record
indicates
she
talked
with
him.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
the
equal
opportunity
employment
officer
that
this
bank
had
in
place.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
certainly
did,
and
the
record
so
indicates.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
he
was
a
senior
bank
officer
who
had
also
been
designated
as
the
equal
opportunity
employment
official
to
carry
out
the
bank's
policy
of
non-discrimination.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
it
would
be
our
feeling
that
if
notice
goes
to
one
who
has
requisite
authority
to
correct
the
situation,
that
is
all
that's
sufficient.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
well,
if
you're
positing
a
question
in
terms
of--
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
--if
there
would
still
be
the
president
left
to
complain
to,
certainly
that
could
be
a
complaint.
but
we
don't
rule
out
the
fact
that
she
could
go
directly
to
the
eeoc.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
we
feel
that's
correct.
we
feel
that
there's
a
separate
liability
standard
under
the
statute.
the
best
evidence
and
the
clearest
indication
is
what
the
defendant
does
or
does
not
do
when
the
plaintiff
complains.
does
the
employer
investigates,
take
prompt
action,
or
is
the
complaint
met
with
indifference?
most
important
is
his
receptiveness
to
employee
grievances.
in
this
case,
ms.
vinson
did
not
prove
that
the
bank
had
actual
knowledge.
she
also
did
not
prove
that
the
bank
had
any
reason
to
know
about
it.
in
sum,
she
failed
to
offer
any
believable
evidence
of
discrimination.
we
also
feel
that
the
objectives
of
title
vii
are
best
promoted
by
basing
liability
on
some
form
of
notice.
it
encourages
employees
to
speak
up
promptly,
rather
than
to
suffer
in
silence,
and
it
permits
the
employer
to
end
the
problem
before
it
worsens,
and
it
encourages
employers
to
address
the
problem
because
if
they
do
they
exonerate
themselves
from
title
vii
liability.
prompt,
voluntary
action
is
far
superior
to
a
belated
federal
injunction.
there
is
simply
nothing
unfair
about
requiring
an
employee
to
speak
up
when
she
perceives
that
her
supervisor
is
harassing
her.
after
all,
sooner
or
later
she'll
have
to
make
a
complaint
to
someone
if
she
wants
title
vii
relief.
but
there
is
something,
we
submit,
very
unfair
about
hailing
an
innocent
employer
into
court
for
a
problem
that
it
was
unaware
of
and
would
have
corrected
voluntarily.
we
submit
that
title
vii
calls
upon
the
court
to
do
equity.
it
is
contrary
to
equity
to
hold
an
innocent
employer
automatically
liable
where
the
complainant
has
waited
in
silence
and
intensified
her
injuries.
notice
and
opportunity
to
cure
is
consistent
with
the
statute,
it
furthers
the
statute's
goals,
and
it's
fair.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals's
decision
must
be
reversed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
ask
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
f.
robert
troll,
jr.
very
briefly,
the
reason
why
notice
to
mr.
taylor
is
not
notice
to
the
bank
is
that
notice
to
the
actual
perpetrator
in
and
of
itself
can
never
constitute
notice.
the
perpetrator
is
motivated
to
keep
his
conduct
secret
and
to
keep
it
concealed
from
his
superiors,
who
may
discipline
him
for
it.
this
rule
requiring
notice
is
particularly
heightened
in
this
form
of
sexual
harassment
case,
where
one
on
one
conduct
occurs.
simply
put,
the
victim
knows
that
notice
will
more
than
likely
not
come
from
her
supervisor.
if
she
wishes
relief,
she
must
complain.
in
the
example
given,
i
think,
where
a
complaint
is
made
to
a
vice
president,
notice
can
never
go
to
the
perpetrator,
but
it
can
in
fact
go
to
an
eeo
officer
or
somebody
higher
up,
or
even
to
the
eeoc.
thank
you.
