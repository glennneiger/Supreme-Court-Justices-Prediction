justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
right
there.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
you
say
it's
not
a
condition
of
employment.
that
means
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
sexual
harassment
hostile
environment
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
in
effect
the
claim
just
has
been
waived,
or
what
is
the
theory?
i
mean,
you're
not
denying
that
there
can
be
such
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
even
if
there
were
psychological
harm,
it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
this
is
i
guess
another
way
of
stating
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
that
there
must
be
some
tangible
loss
of
job
economic
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
do
i
correctly
read
your
brief
to
indicate
that
you
would
not
make
the
same
notice
argument
if
it
were
a
quid
pro
quo
type
of
claim?
and
if
so,
why
do
you
distinguish
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
is
that
any
different
from
acting
with
respect
to
the
conditions,
working
conditions
around
the
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
question,
supposing
the
harassment,
if
it
did
occur...
and
of
course,
we
don't
really
know
exactly
what
did
happen
here.
but
assume
that
there
were
ten
employees
and
supervisor,
and
nine
of
the
employees
harassed
the
other,
the
tenth.
the
supervisor
just
sat
there
and
watched
and
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
but
nobody
ever
reported
it
to
the
home
office.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
you
would
make
the
same
argument?
