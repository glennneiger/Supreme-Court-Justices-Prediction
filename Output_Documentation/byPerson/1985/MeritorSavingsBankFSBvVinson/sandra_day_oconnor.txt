mr.
troll,
do
you
concede
that
the
trial
court
simply
didn't
handle
the
case
as
one
involving
a
recognition
of
a
sexual
harassment
or
hostile
environment
type
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so
you
agree
that
the
district
court
really
didn't
try
the
case
with
that
theory
in
mind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
agree
today
that
that
is
a
valid
claim
or
could
be
a
valid
claim
under
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
without
detriment
other
than
the
suffering
that
occurs
in
the
hostile
environment
itself,
do
you
agree
that
such
a
claim
might
exist?
i
notice
that
the
solicitor
general
in
an
amicus
brief
suggests
that
there
is
such
a
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
if
it
were
a
racial
harmful
environment
claim
that
a
tangible
effect
on
employment
is
a
necessary
element
of
such
a
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
principle
should
apply
similarly
in
a
sexual
harassment
claim
as
it
would
to
a
racial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
troll,
isn't
supervision...
isn't
part
of
supervision
the
creation
of
a
productive
work
environment
and
the
proper
management
of
the
employees
who
are
supervised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
the
agency
theory
then
cover
an
assumption
that
the
supervisor
is
going
to
create
a
proper
and
productive
work
environment
for
the
employees
being
supervised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
the
supervisor
discharged
an
employee
within
his
apparent
authority
to
do
so,
but
his
real
reason
was
a
racial
discriminatory
reason,
do
you
think
the
employer
has
a
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
certainly
are
a
substantial
number
of
lower
court
cases
dealing
with,
for
example,
racial
harassment
by
co-employees,
that
don't
adopt
your
theory
at
all.
and
they
go
off
on
the
theory
that
if
the
supervisor
knows
or
has
reason
to
know
of
the
racial
environment
claims
of
co-employees,
that's
enough.
don't
you
agree--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
there
is
a
body
of
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
some
form
of
management,
of
course,
is
the
supervisor.
he's
the
person
in
place
and
who's
in
charge
of
trying
to
protect
the
work
environment
for
the
employees.
that's
part
of
the
job.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
the
district
court
kept
out
evidence
that
was
offered
of
the
supervisor's
treatment
of
other
employes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
barry,
did
you
represent
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
plaintiff
and
you
on
her
behalf
make
clear
in
the
proceedings
below
that
you
were
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
a
hostile
environment
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
been
suggested
that
an
element
is
a
sexual
harassment
claim
is
that
the
conduct
complained
of
be
unwelcome.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
term
"unwelcome"
the
same
as...
does
that
equate
with
whether
it's
voluntary
or
not,
or
is
there
a
difference
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
as
an
element
of
a
sexual
harassment
claim
that
the
conduct
must
be
unwelcome?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course
it
isn't
standing
alone
here.
there's
other
evidence
as
well.
so
i
think
you
have
to
consider
it
in
light
of
all
the
evidence.
now,
what
evidence
can
come
in
properly
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
unwelcome,
does
the
whole
picture
emerge
so
that
the
trier
of
fact
can
make
that
determination?
