mr.
carson
f.
eller
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
two
issues
were
presented
to
this
court
and
one
was
accepted.
the
one
that
was
not
accepted
was
the
issue
on
the
definition
of
"seaman".
i
therefore
conclude
that
the
definition
as
handed
down
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
becomes
the
law
of
the
land.
that
definition
of
180
degrees--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
think
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
that
the
ninth
circuit's
definition
of
"seaman"
not
stands,
because--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--the
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
it
was
my
understanding
we
were
only
here
on
the
standard
of
review,
the
second
issue.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
well,
unless
this
court
is
overruling
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
definition
of
"seaman",
that
was
the
impression
i
had,
it
would--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--well,
that's
correct.
the
court's
correct.
at
any
rate,
your
honor,
the
definition
that
they
gave
there
at
the
ninth
circuit
is
directly
opposite
of
what
the
one
was
given
in
the
district
court,
and
therefore
the
conclusion
is
that
a
mistake
was
made.
once
a
mistake
has
been
made,
then
comes
to
play
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
has
been
much
maligned
and
it
has
been
much
talked
about.
there
have
been
three
very
major
cases
in
the
1980's
that
this
court
has
handed
down:
pullman,
and
bose,
and
bessemer
city
versus
anderson.
after
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
a
mistake
has
been
made,
then
i
suppose
the
next
job
it
has
to
do
is
to
find
a
way
to
overrule
the
district
court
and
to
do
it
with
dignity.
there
seem
to
be,
in
my
review
of
all
the
cases,
some
very
much
reluctance
of
the
part
of
a
circuit
court
to
find
a
district
court
clearly
erroneous.
they
go
to
great
efforts
to
avoid
that
if
possible,
even
going
back
to
the
gypsum
case
in
1948.
that's
where
the
language
originate
that
a
mistake
was
made.
they
used
that
word
rather
than
say
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
the
rule
then
has
a
second
part
which
deals
with
credibility,
and
in
my
opinion
once
you
have
removed
the
credibility
portion
from
rule
52
you
have
practically
destroyed
it.
in
this
case,
credibility
definitely
was
not
at
issue.
the
facts
could
have
very
well
been
stipulated
to.
there
is
nothing
in
dispute
about
what
a
welder
does.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
yes.
i
have
a
copy
of
that
here,
and
it
goes
a
little
bit
further.
you
said
there
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
if
the
district
court
findings
rested
on
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law
they
may
be
set
aside
on
that
basis.
and
that
court
goes
on
then...
or
this
court
in
that
case
went
on
and
discussed
the
other
method
of
review
that
was
set
forth
in
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
case.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
i'm
not
saying
it
doesn't
apply.
i
don't
find
the
exact
language
offhand,
but
it
says
that
the
burden
of
establishing
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
is
not
as
great
at
that
point.
it
weakens
it.
and
the
clearly
erroneous
then
must
stand
on
just
that,
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous.
the
credibility
appears
in
the
same
sentence.
but
the
funny
thing
about
reviewing
these
cases,
your
honor,
is
the
easy
way
that
necessity
finds
to
get
around
it.
the
new
york
case,
versus
sullivan,
i
think
pioneered
the
question
of
constitutional
law.
it
made
an
exception.
we
do
not
have
to
follow
rule
52,
that
case
said,
because
this
was
a
constitutional
question.
and
i
do
not
find
the
word
52.
so,
it
being
a
rule
of
equity,
i
think
necessity--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--some
of
the
cases
i
referred
to...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
mr.
moore
that
wrote
the
encyclopedia
on
the
federal
rules
alludes
to
that,
that
it's
not
a
strict
standard
of
law.
if
there's
a
necessity
for
it,
like
in
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
then,
a
constitutional
question
being
of
such
great
importance,
first
amendment
rights,
we're
not...
this
court
is
not
bound
to
follow
rule
52.
but
my
whole
reason
for
bringing
it
up,
your
honor,
is
i
think
rule
52
is
highly
flexible,
and
this
court--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--in
this
case...
well,
i
cannot
answer
that
in
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
one
of
the
aspects--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
one
aspect
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
deals
with
the
executive.
that's
another
exemption.
that
is
treated
one
way.
seamen
in
this
case,
another
exemption,
is
treated
another
way.
and
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
exemptions
are
narrowly
construed.
the
seamen
question
here,
as
it
was
presented
in
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions...
and
you'll
notice
by
reading
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
that
the
conclusions
are
two
simple
sentences.
the
court
found
that
these
men
were
exempt.
that
is
the
law.
they
were
exempt
under
rule
213(b).
well,
my
client
says
to
me:
what's
213(b)?
i
said:
that
is
the
portion
of
the
act
that
defines
"seaman".
and
my
client
says:
what
does
it
say?
well,
it
says
that
you
must
be
working
aboard
a
vessel
that
is
used
for
transportation
and
that
you
must
be
aiding
in
its
navigation.
that
is
law.
and
that
beings
me
to
the
next
issue,
that
it's
obvious,
if
that
is
law,
that
this
is
a
case
of
mixed
findings
and
law.
and
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--describing
it,
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
describing
what
the
workman
does
is
a
question
of
fact.
for
instance,
mr.
worthington
is
a
welder.
he
can
be
a
welder
anyplace,
and
his
duties
are
the
same.
a
welder
is
a
welder
is
a
welder.
he
testified
at
trial
that
one
of
the
things
he
did
one
day
was
extend
the
processing
line.
he
fabricated
a
metal
bench
or
something.
and
that
describes
what
he
does.
actually,
that
was
never
in
dispute.
mr.
cameron
was
the
chief
mechanic.
he
worked
on
a
variety
of
things.
two
of
the
other
fellows
were
specialists.
mr.
kent
was
a...
or
davies
was
an
electrician.
and
those
are
findings...
those
are
facts,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you
100
percent.
but
after
you
read
that,
then
you
must
apply
those
to
the
legal
definition
of
"seaman",
and
that's
where
it
becomes
mixed
findings
and
law.
taking
that
with
the
fact--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--if
you
could
stop
there,
yes,
your
honor,
you
would
be.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
you
have
to
come
to
some
conclusion
after
you
have
looked
at
what
they
do?
mr.
carson
f.
eller
the
findings
as
presented
by
the
defendant
says
that
he's
a
seaman,
he's
exempt.
when
they
spell
out
213,
i
think
they're
backed
into
a
corner,
your
honor.
they
tried
to
simplify,
and
that
brings
this
point.
they
tried
to
simplify
the
conclusions
to
make
the
standard
of
review
come
out
like
it
did.
and
i
have
put
in
my
brief,
and
this
court
has
in
some
recent
cases
agreed,
that
the
method
in
which
the
court
had
the
findings
prepared
is
frowned
upon.
i
found
no
cases
that
do
anything
about
it,
but
designating
one
party
after
the
decision
has
been
handed
down,
designating
one
party
to
prepare
the
findings
and
then
adopting
those,
is
one
of
the
problems
created
here.
and
i
think
the
petitioner
got
backed
into
a
corner
on
that
and
i
have
no
sympathy
for
him,
because
in
making
his
findings
very
short
and
referring
to
a
section
of
the
act,
they're
referring
to
the
section
that
defines
"seaman",
and
that
is
pure
law.
you
cannot
separate
them.
mr.
moore
in
his
analysis
when
he
wrote
the
encyclopedia
says
it's
almost
impossible
to
separate
facts
and
conclusions
in
many
cases,
and
this
court
has
said
that,
i
think
in
the
bose
case.
and
i
agree,
and
we
nitpick
it
to
death
trying
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
there
will
ever
be
a
rule
that
clearly
defines
findings.
each
case
stands
on
its
own.
for
instance,
they
use
the
word
"maritime".
i
think
that
was
a
direct
attempt
to
get
around
this
strict--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
tried
to
be--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
anticipated
a
question
from
the
court
just
like
that,
your
honor,
and
i
tried--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
tried
to
form
in
my
own
mind...
now,
if
i
had
the
authority,
i'm
going
to
redraft
rule
52,
and
i
would
do
it
this
way,
i
couldn't
get
very
far.
and
that's
why
i
called
it
a
moment
ago
a
rule
of
equity.
it
has
a
lot
of
discretion
and
a
lot
of
flexibility.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
i
think
this
court
should...
well,
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
was
groping
around
for
a
method
of
reversing
with
dignity.
i
think
this
court
should
let
the
decision
of
the
circuit
stand,
and
i
say
that,
your
honor,
because
justice
frankfurter
very
appropriately
pointed
out
that
this
case
does
not
involve
national
policy
and,
unless
there
is
such--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--no.
this
case
didn't
exist.
the
case
that
he
was
referring
to,
he
was
talking
about
a
writ
that
came
up.
he
says,
unless
it
involves
national
policy
or
unless
the
inconsistencies
among
the
circuits
are
an
embarrassment,
that
these
kind
of
cert's
should
not
be
granted.
and
that
was
going
to
be
one
of
my
concluding
remarks,
that
this
court--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
think
we
should
dismiss
it
as
being
improvidentially
granted.
that
would
be
one
way
this
court
could
escape
the
agony
of
having
to
decide
if
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
carson
f.
eller
i
haven't
gotten
that
far,
your
honor.
it
might
be
a
little
tough.
[laughter]
mr.
carson
f.
eller
it
was
a
good
concept,
but
i
didn't
follow
it
through,
apparently.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
for
instance,
you
take
the
portion
on
first
processing.
i
think
that
the
interpretation
of
that
is
clearly
erroneous,
because
first
processing
is
done,
according
to
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
aboard
the
vessel
that
catches
the
fish,
and
this
vessel
never
did
catch
a
fish.
no
one
aboard
it
caught
a
fish.
the
fish
was
brought
in
to
them.
i
think
that
portion
of
the
findings
is
wrong.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
yes,
there's
a
second
issue--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--in
describing
what
they
did,
i
do
not
think...
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
because
the
only
way
you
can--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--it's
mixed.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
it's
definitely
mixed.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
well,
it's
like
this
case
in--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--you
might
say
that.
i
have
a
lot
of
quarrel
with
the
word
"maritime".
that
was
something
that
came
out
of
left
field.
"maritime",
the
word
"maritime"
and
the
way
they
use
it
in
the
findings,
does
not
appear
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
and
i
think
that
was
an
attempt
to
get
around
the
burden
of
trying
to
define
"seaman".
and
i
think
it
was
actually
invented
by
this
court.
i
find
no
legal
precedent
for
maritime
duty
as
a
test.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
i
would...
navigable
waters,
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
brief.
is
it
navigable
waters
when
you're
moored
in
the
mouth
of
a
river?
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
a
get
into
that.
they
didn't
define
what's
"navigable".
that's
one
thing
that
justice
o'connor
pointed
out.
the
court
didn't
define
that
and
they
didn't
define
the
workplace.
and
there
again,
we
were
at
a
disadvantage
when
we
didn't
have
a
court
reporter
there
to
take
down
what
the
court's
decision
was.
and
then
when
the
court
went
further
and
designated
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
do
the
findings,
then
it
further
weakened
my
ability
to
present
the
facts
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
put
them
in
a
spot.
mr.
carson
f.
eller
i
get
the
impression
they
would
have--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
agree.
i
think
that
was--
mr.
carson
f.
eller
--i
find
it
a
little
difficult,
justice
o'connor,
to
carry
the
ninth
circuit's
cross.
but
in
an
attempt
to
do
so,
i
point
out
that
i'm
sure
that
they
felt
that,
as
i
did,
that
the
findings
in
this
case
were
180
degrees
off
from
what
the
existing
law
was.
therefore,
the
ninth
circuit
must
find
a
way
with
dignity
to
overrule
that.
a
mistake
has
been
made,
and
then
it
started.
and
they
should
have
come
right
out
and
said
it's
clearly
erroneous,
but
for
some
reason
they
don't
care
to
do
that.
but
at
any
rate,
i
would
conclude
my
argument,
your
honor,
by
saying
that
justice
in
this
case
was
done
by
the
ninth
circuit
because
we
have
a
tendency
in
the
course
of
defining
the
technicalities
of
the
law
to
ignore
why
we
were
there
in
the
first
place.
we
have
four
gentlemen
that
were
working
12
hours
a
day,
seven
days
a
week,
around
machinery,
when
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
for
it.
there
was
no
emergency.
there
was
no
catch
that
was
on
the
run.
there
was
no
bad
weather
that
was
causing
all
this
overtime.
it
was
strictly
for
profit.
and
you
must
keep
in
mind
what
the
reason
for
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
when
enacted
back
in
the
thirties,
one
of
which
was
to
discourage
working
men
12
hours
a
day,
seven
days
a
week,
because
they
become
tired.
it
was
a
safety
factor.
and
that
was
totally
ignored
here.
whatever
method
can
be
used
to
avoid
that
in
the
future,
i
think
it
should
be
done.
thank
you.
