mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fair
labor
standards
act's
overtime
pay
requirements
do
not
apply
to
someone
who
is
"employed
as
a
seaman".
the
act
does
not
define
the
term
"employed
as
a
seaman".
however,
administrative
and
court
interpretations
have
clarified
that
the
term
"seaman"
is
not
limited
to
what
we
would
ordinarily
think
of
as
sailors...
skippers,
deck
crew.
it
includes
other
members
of
a
ship's
crew...
its
cooks,
its
pursers,
and,
pertinent
here,
its
engineers.
the
question
is
the
case
is
whether
marine
engineers
aboard
a
seagoing
processing
vessel
were
correctly
categorized
as
seamen
and
therefore
paid
a
fixed
salary
without
allowance
for
overtime.
the
issue
this
morning
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
under
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
correctly
substituted
its
own
determination
that
these
engineers
are
not
seamen
because
they
primarily
perform
not
maritime
but
industrial
duties,
on
the
trial
judge's
determination
that
the
engineers
or
the
arctic
star
were
employed
as
seamen
because
the
nature
of
their
work
was
maritime.
the
court
of
appeals'
degree
of
freedom
to
substitute
its
own
determination
in
this
regard
depends
in
our
analysis
upon
whether
that
court
disagreed
with
the
trial
judge's
understanding
of
how
to
define
the
term
"employed
as
a
seaman",
in
which
case
it
would
be
free
to
substitute
its
own
definition,
or
whether
it
disagreed
with
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
the
facts,
in
which
case
it
would
be
required
to
pay
deference
to
the
trial
judge's
findings
under
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
here
our
contention
is
and
the
record
shows
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
fault
the
district
court
for
misunderstanding
the
definition
of
the
term
"employed
as
a
seaman".
there
wasn't
doubt
about
that
term.
it
was
well
established
that
someone
is
employed
as
a
seaman
of
he
is
"a
member
of
a
ship's
crew
whose
work
is
primarily
maritime.
"
what
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
with
was
the
trial
judge's
determination
that
the
work
of
these
engineers
was
primarily
maritime,
and
substituted
its
own
determination
that
the
maritime
work
was
only
incidental
to
primary
duties
which
were
in
essence
industrial
maintenance.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
well,
that
depends
in
our
analysis
on
what
the
issue
is.
if
the
question
is--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--it
has
both
elements
to
it.
if
the
dispute
is
over
how
you
define
the
term
"seaman",
from
our
standpoint,
what
character
of
duties
make
someone
a
seaman,
if
that
is
what
is
at
issue,
you
have
the
legal
aspect
of
that
question.
if
the
issue
is
what
are
the
character
of
the
duties
of
these
particular
workers,
then
that
aspect
of
the
determination
is
factual.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
yes.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
yes.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
yes.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
yes.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
they
were
before
the
court.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
the
language
of
the
findings
and
of
the
conclusions
is
in
the
terminology
of
the
regulations.
but
specific
reference
is
not
made
in
the
oral
opinion
on.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
the
ninth
circuit
mentioned
that
the
arctic
star
spends
in
its
opinion
more
time
at
anchor
than
she
does
under
way,
that
is
true.
but
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
itself,
there
is
no
rule
of
law
which
develops
that
a
barge
which
is
not
self-propelled
cannot
be
staffed
by
seamen.
and
indeed,
the
administrator's
regulations
specifically
deal
with
that
kind
of
situation.
the
case
that
earlier
arose
here
indeed
involved
this
very
kind
of
situation,
your
honor.
it
involved,
for
instance,
dredging
barges.
and
the
distinction
that
was
drawn...
dredging
barges,
which
of
course
are
also
towed;
they
are
not
self-propelled.
the
distinction
that
developed
from
the
cases
is
whether
the
particular
workers
that
are
at
issue
are
part
of
that
vessel's
crew,
meaning
their
work
is
to
maintain
that
vessel,
or
whether
they
are
really
floating
miners,
whether
their
work
really
is
to
be
part
of
the
dredging
crew
and
the
vessel
carries
them
to
their
work.
that's
the
difference.
but
there
is
no...
in
fact,
it's
to
the
contrary.
the
regulations
of
the
administrator
provide
that
on
a...
they
specifically
deal
with
a
non-self-propelled
barge,
and
they
specify
that
whether
a
hand
aboard
a
non-self-propelled
barge
is
a
seaman
depends
on
whether
principally
his
duties
are
maritime
in
character
or
whether,
by
contrast,
he
is
more
like
a
floating
stevedore
or
whether
he
is
involved
in
the
production
work
that
occurs
aboard
the
vessel.
so
there
was
no--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--they
are
engineers.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
they
are
not
coast
guard
licensed,
because
there
are
specific
exemptions
that
apply
to
this
industry
and
these
types
of
crafts.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
in
my
opinion
it
is
not.
the
trial
judge
determined
that...
because
the
trial
judge
had
before
her
a
discussion
of
what
duties
a
licensed
seaman
does,
a
licensed
marine
engineer
does.
and
with
the
witnesses
she
reviewed...
before
her
were
reviewed,
a
question
of
which
of
these
duties
seemed
to
describe
those
of
the
engineers
aboard
the
arctic
star.
and
a
major
point
in
the
opinion
and
in
her
fact
finding
in
that
the
duties
of
these
particular
engineers
are
the
duties
of
marine
engineers
and
they
are
the
essential
equivalent
of
what
a
marine
coast
guard
licensed
engineer
would
do.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
it's
not
required.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
i
am
the
first
to
admit
i'm
not
an
admiralty
lawyer,
your
honor.
what
the
trial
judge
determined,
to
follow
up
on
where
we
were,
is
that
these
marine
engineers
are
seamen
because
their
duties
are
maritime,
and
the
specific
fact
findings
that
she
made
are
important
to
review,
because
they
were
these.
first,
that
these
engineers
were
responsible
for
maintaining
all
the
systems
for
the
operation
of
that
vessel
while
at
moorage
or
under
way.
second,
that
they
had
to
be
available
on
call
24
hours
a
day
if
necessary
to
keep
the
vessel
operating.
the
sea
doesn't
work
a
9:00
to
5:00
day,
either.
third,
that
they
performed
the
tasks
of
coast
guard
licensed
seamen.
fourth,
that
theirs
was
the
work
of
a
marine
engineer;
marine
engineer
was
not
just
a
title.
fifth,
that
they
were
members
of
the
crew
of
the
arctic
star
and
performed
work
which
was
maritime
in
character.
and
from
that
followed
her
ultimate
factual
conclusion
that
their
employment
was
that
of
a
seaman.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
they--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--that's
the
problem
in
the
opinion.
they
did
not
tackle
the
findings
of
fact
and
say,
we
find
that
these
are
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
or
that
we
don't
have
to
find
whether
they're
clearly
erroneous,
because
they
involve
legal
interpretations.
they
did
neither
one.
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
is
this.
initially,
it
felt
that
the
determination
of
the
whole
question
of
what
is
seaman
status
is
a
question
of
law,
and
boldly
in
its
first
opinion
said:
this
is
a
question
of
law
and
we
are
free
to
substitute
our
determination
for
that
of
the
trial
court.
we
moved
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
challenging
that
independence
and
pointing
out
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
established
standard
of
review
in
such
questions
in
the
supreme
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
cases.
and
in
a
revised
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
did
this,
very
similar
in
our
opinion
to
what
occurred
in
the
pullman-standard
versus
swint
case
which
was
here
a
couple
of
years
back.
the
opinion
acknowledges
there
is
some
role
for
trial
court
findings
which
are
subject
to
limited
scrutiny.
but
what
it
did
was
to
substitute
its
own
fact
findings
all
the
same,
without
finding
the
trial
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
it
is
true
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
revised
opinion
said
that
it
was
applying
a
de
novo
standard
of
review
only
to
the
application
of
this
exemption
to
the
facts,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
there
was
no
area
of
disagreement
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
trial
court
which
the
ninth
circuit
could
have
properly
reviewed
de
novo.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
if
so,
i
would
have
thought
they
should
have
remanded
to
determine
whether
those
facts--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--it
did.
now,
when
one
traces
back
the
language
your
honor
is
mentioning
to
the
regulations,
which
are
extensive...
the
regulations
say
a
lot
of
things,
but
they
also
say
that.
when
you
trace
back
to
the
origins
of
that
phrase,
you
get
back
to
the
barge
cases,
the
barge
cases
i
was
mentioning.
and
while,
because
primarily
i
believe
the
facts
in
the
cases
that
the
administrator
was
looking
at
involved
transportation,
vehicles
which
are
primarily
transport
vehicles,
when
you
trace
the
language
back
to
the
origins,
it
is
a
case
which
draws
a
distinction
not
between
whether
the
employees
are
primarily
aiding
in
navigation...
after
all,
the
regulations
also
exempt
cooks,
surgeons,
people
who
plainly
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
being
a
"sailor".
those
regulations
exempt
a
number
of
people
who
are
not
involved
in
navigation.
and
when
you
trace
back
that
language
to
its
origins,
it
leads
you
to
cases
which
distinguish
between
whether
a
worker
is
part
of
the
ship's
crew
or
part
of
a
production
crew
working
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
if
the
ninth
circuit
feels
that
there
is
an
element
of
legal
interpretation
in
those
facts,
i
don't
say
we
lose
our
case,
because
the
remedy
is
a
remand
to
sort
out
that
which
is
legal
from
that
which
is
factual.
when
someone
says,
i
find
the
person
is
a
seaman,
i
find
that
his
duties
are
maritime,
i
find...
and
it
gets
more
and
more
concrete...
i
find
that
he
does
the
work
of
a
coast
guard
licensed
engineer,
there
is
of
course
a
range
of
things,
and
it's
not
so
easy
to
tell
when
fact
starts
and
when
you
start
getting
into
a
legal
term,
especially
when
a
statute
uses
words
that
are
common
in
the
english
language.
no,
i
don't
say
we
lose
our
case
on
that.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
well,
the
reason
we
make
much
of
that
is
that
when
one
reviews
the
trial
record,
and
keeping
in
mind
this
was
a
trial
before
a
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
and
the
testimony
and
concluded
that
these
are
the
facts,
we
think
that's
very
significant,
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
those
findings
and
say
that,
we
disagree
with
them
because
they're
clearly
erroneous.
and
that's
why
we
make
much
of
it.
as
we
look
at
the
record
before
you,
at
the
very
least
this
case
could
be
decided
either
way
on
the
record
that's
before
you,
at
the
very
least.
and
if
that's
so,
if
there
is
room
to
interpret
the
evidence
that
the
trial
court
heard
two
ways,
then,
as
you've
recently
recognized
in
the
anderson
case,
is
is
not
the
ninth
circuit's
job,
it's
not
the
ninth
circuit's
job
to
substitute
its
interpretation
for
that
of
the
trial
court.
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
felt
the
government--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--that
would
have
been
in
incorrect
legal
standard.
they
would
have
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law,
and
we
would
have
sought
review
for
a
different
reason.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
i
will
go
that
far,
yes.
the
ultimate
determination
of
seaman,
when
the
issue
has
to
do
with
what
the
duties
of
the
workers
were,
not
with
how
do
you
interpret
the
term.
that's
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
draw,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
an
approach
to
analyzing
it
that
goes
this
way.
when
we're
looking
at
the
question
of
what
standard
of
review
to
apply
to
a
question
like,
are
the
engineers
aboard
the
arctic
star
employed
as
seamen,
that
we
sort
out
what
is
the
nature
of
disagreement
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
trial
court.
which
aspect
of
that
question
are
they
disagreeing
with?
are
they
disagreeing
with
how
the
trial
court
interpreted
the
term
of
what
is
a
seaman,
or
are
they
disagreeing
with
what
the
trial
court
found
the
duties
of
these
particular
workers
were.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
when
the
issue
is
what
does
"seaman"
mean
within
the
statute,
it's
a
legal
question.
as
a
for
instance,
let's
suppose
the--
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
--it
is
both
fact
and
law.
if
for
instance
the
question
is
is
the
cook
a
seaman,
that
is
a
legal
question.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
we're
talking
past
each
other,
i'm
sorry.
if
the
disagreement
between
the
courts
on
that
point
has
to
do
with
the
fact
aspect
of
that
next
question,
i
would
say
they
do
have
to
review
it
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
yes.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
the
word...
excuse
me.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
the
word
"seaman"
has
both
legal
aspects
and
fact
aspects,
depending
on
what
the
question
is.
if
the
question
is
how
do
you
define
a
seaman
under
this
statute,
that's
a
legal
interpretation.
if
you
ask,
are
they
seamen
for
purposes...
when
the
issue
is
what
do
their
duties
involve,
that
is
factual,
and
that's
where
the
disagreement
was,
as
we
read
it,
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
trial
court.
the
disagreement
was
over
the
part
of
the
question,
what
are
the
duties
of
these
engineers?
are
they
predominantly
maritime
or
only
incidentally
maritime?
and
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
trial
court
disagreed
upon,
which
we
submit
to
you
is
factual.
in
a
nutshell,
the
dispute
in
our
opinion
is
not
essentially
one
over
legal
interpretation.
it
is
a
dispute
essentially
over
how
do
you
view
the
evidence.
and
where
it's
a
dispute
over
how
you
view
the
evidence,
the
ninth
circuit's
freedom
to
substitute
its
answer
for
the
trial
court's
assessment
on
this
point
was
subject
to
the
restrictive
rule
that
only
a
clearly
erroneous
determination
could
be
set
aside
and
the
ninth
circuit's
answer
substituted.
there
are
policy
reasons
for
discouraging
appellate
courts
from
involving
themselves
too
extensively
in
the
fact
finding
process,
with
which
i
am
sure
you...
of
which
i
know
you
are
aware.
in
a
nutshell,
our
opinion
is
that
the
trial
judge's
determination
that
the
essential
nature
of
the
work
of
the
engineers
aboard
the
arctic
star
is
maritime
and
that
they
are
therefore
exempt
as
seamen
is
one
that
you
cannot...
one
cannot
say
is
a
clearly
erroneous
determination
and
therefore
the
ninth
circuit
should
not
have
reversed
the
trial
court's
judgment.
mr.
clemens
h.
barnes
briefly,
your
honor.
sometimes
the
star
is
at
anchor
while
it's
processing.
that's
part
of
the
picture.
other
times
the
arctic
star
is
under
way.
granted,
not
by
its
own
power,
being
pulled,
tugged
by
a
tugboat,
but
it
is
under
way
in
the
open
seas.
it
takes
voyages,
according
to
the
transcript,
as
long
as
13
days.
it
carries
its
crew
as
passengers.
it
will
sometimes
even
carry
the
fishing
boats
themselves.
it
carries
cargo
in
the
hold.
it
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
on
oceangoing
vessel.
it
just
doesn't
have
its
own
engine.
now,
there
are
aspects
in
one
respect,
there
are
aspects
in
the
other.
it's
a
question
of
evaluating
and
interpreting
the
facts
across
the
board
and
not
focusing
just
on
one
or
just
on
the
other.
the
rule
of
walling
versus
general
industries
was
that
a
trial
court,
by
this
court,
is
that
a
trial
court's
findings
that
a
particular
worker
because
of
his
duties
is
exempt,
there
as
an
executive,
should
be
left
undisturbed
unless
clearly
erroneous.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
attempted
to
distinguish
the
rule
in
walling
versus
general
industries,
just
as
mr.
eller
has,
as
having
involved
a
question
of
overturning
a
trial
court's
evaluations
following
disputed
testimony...
credibility,
in
a
word.
the
opinions
of
this
court
are
plain
now
that,
while
credibility,
ability
to
observe
the
credibility
of
witnesses,
is
one
factor
that
puts
a
trial
court
in
a
better
position
to
evaluate
testimony,
it
is
not
the
sole
reason
that
trial
court
finding
are
to
be
left
undisturbed
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
the
rule,
after
all,
has
two
parts.
it
says
that
those
fact
findings
are
to
be
left
undisturbed
unless
clearly
erroneous
and...
not
if...
there
is
a
dispute
over
credibility,
and
the
trial
court's
ability
to
judge
credibility
is
also
to
be
kept
in
mind.
the
second
certainly
doesn't
limit
the
first.
in
a
nutshell,
the
record
could
have
been
read
either
way,
at
the
very
least.
the
trial
court
read
it
one
way,
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed.
when
it
can
be
read
in
either
way
and
it
involves
essentially
an
interpretation
of
the
facts,
under
the
correct
standard
of
review
the
trial
court
should
have
been
reversed
only
if
clearly
erroneous.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
do
it,
and
the
trial
court
in
any
event
was
not
clearly
erroneous
in
what
it
found.
thank
you.
