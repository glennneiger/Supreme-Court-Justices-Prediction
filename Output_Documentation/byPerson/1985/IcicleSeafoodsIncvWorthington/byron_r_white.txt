justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
law
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
denied
cert
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
it
the
law
of
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
didn't
affirm
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
must
we
review
every
case
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
makes
that
impossible
attempt
and
comes
to
some
conclusion
as
to
what
is
facts
and
what
is
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
a
pretty
fact-bound
question
in
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
you
give
me
a
good
answer.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
again
i
ask
you.
should
we
disagree
with
courts
of
appeals
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
we
should
dismiss
it,
is
that
it?
