are
these
people
engineers,
so-called?
justice

they
were
not
licensed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
non-licensure
fact
of
any
significance
in
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
a
reason
why
they
weren't
licensed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
don't
they
move
from
ship
to
ship?
if
this
were
a
self-propelled
ship,
they
certainly
would
have
to
be
licensed?
justice
harry

mr.
barnes,
there's
a
lot
of
argument
between
the
two
of
you
as
to
whether
these
were
pure
findings
of
fact
or
were
something
more
than
that.
if
they
were
something
more
than
that
and
de
novo
review
was
proper,
do
you
lose
your
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
would
hope
not,
although
i
must
confess
in
reading
the
briefs
it
almost
seems
that
way
as
between
the
two
of
you.
there
is
so
much
made
over
whether
these
are
pure
findings
of
fact.
