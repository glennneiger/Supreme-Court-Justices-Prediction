mr.
barnes,
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
the
workers
were
seamen,
is
it
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
ultimate
determination
whether
someone
is
a
seaman,
is
that
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
subsidiary
fact
finding
that
goes
into
it
would
be
factual?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
now,
there
are
administrative
regulations,
are
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
interpreting
what
the
law
requires--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
who
is
a
seaman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
district
court
make
any
reference
at
all
to
those
administrative
regulations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
district
court
mention
them
at
all?
i
didn't
find
any
reference
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
some
question
or
difficulty
here
because
the
craft
on
which
they
were
working
is
not
self-propelled
or
engaged
in
navigation?
so
did
the
ninth
circuit
disagree
with
some
of
the
district
court's
legal
holdings
that
went
into
its
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
barnes,
i
think
the
thing
that
still
confuses
be
is
that
the
regulations,
the
administrative
regulations
for
determining
who
is
a
seaman,
require
or
set
forth
a
test,
that
the
work
of
a
seaman
is
work
in
aid
of
navigation,
in
aid
of
navigation.
and
as
i
understood
it,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
the
district
court
never
addressed
that,
never
addressed
the
test
set
out
in
the
administrative
regulations,
because
the
trial
court
based
its
finding
just
on,
well,
this
is
maritime,
but
it
never
said
whether
the
work
was
in
aid
of
navigation
or
how
it
was.
now,
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
worried
about,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
so,
too,
although
it
went
ahead
and
decided
them
on
its
own,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
in
the
context
of
the
federal
fair
standards
act
that
we
should
not
apply
rule
52
to
the
subsidiary
fact
findings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
eller,
is
it
correct
that
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
the
facts
were
all
right
as
far
as
they
went,
but
that
additional
findings
should
have
been
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
isn't
clear
from
the
opinion,
but
i
wonder
if
that
is
the
fault
found
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
the
facts
as
far
as
they
went
were
all
right,
but
there
should
have
been
additional
findings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
did
the
ninth
circuit
go
ahead
and
make
those
findings,
instead
of
saying
to
the
trial
judge:
we
need
some
additional
findings,
go
make
them.
