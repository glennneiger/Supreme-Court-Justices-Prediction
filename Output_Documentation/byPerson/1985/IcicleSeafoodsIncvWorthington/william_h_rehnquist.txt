justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
we
say
in
pullman-standard
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
applied
just
beyond
where
there
were
credibility
determinations
to
be
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
maintaining
now
that,
because
there
was
no
issue
of
credibility
in
the
district
court,
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
didn't
apply.
and
i
was
saying
that
i
thought
in
swint
we
had
said
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
call
it
a
rule
of
equity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wasn't
referring
to
this
particular
case,
was
he?
