we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
icicle
seafoods
against
worthington.
mr.
barnes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.
burger
mr.
eller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
not
essentially
a
question
of
fact,
what
he
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
record
shows
that
he
doesn't
do
the
things
that
seamen
do
traditionally
and
he
does
the
things
that
maintenance
and
repairmen
do,
aren't
you
back
to
pure
facts
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
can't
you
stop
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
conclusion
is
that
he's
a
welder
and
a
repairman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you'll
leave
that
to
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
barnes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
