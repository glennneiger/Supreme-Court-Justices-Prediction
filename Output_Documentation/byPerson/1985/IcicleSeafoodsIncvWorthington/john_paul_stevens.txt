john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
there,
because
maybe
i'm
troubled
by
the
same
thing
justice
o'connor
is.
supposing
they
had
said...
and
i
know
their
opinion
doesn't
quite
say
this...
with
respect
to
the
five
subsidiary,
clearly
factual
inquiries,
the
district
court
was
absolutely
right,
and
then
they
said,
nevertheless
we
don't
think
that
this
person...
these
people
were
seamen,
because
this
doesn't
establish
their
work
was
in
aid
of
navigation.
would
that
have
been
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
sea.
but
is
it
your
view
that
on
the
ultimate...
i'm
still
not
quite
clear...
on
the
ultimate
determination
of
whether
they're
seamen
or
not,
that
that
has
to
be
viewed
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
it,
assuming
we
don't
dismiss
the
case.
i've
just
been
looking
at
the
district
court's
findings
and
there
are,
as
i
read
it,
there
are
seven.
the
eighth
finding
is
on
a
different
issue.
and
the
last
sentence
of
federal
seven
is:
"each
of
the
plaintiffs'
employment
was
that
of
a
seamen.
"
now,
if
we
eliminated
that
sentence
and
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
that's
a
statement
of
law
or
something
like
that,
is
there
anything
in
the
findings
that
precede
that
sentence
that
you
think
is
erroneous
in
any
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
one
actually
went
to
this
other
issue,
not
to
the
seaman
issue,
didn't
it?
wasn't
there
an
issue
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--insofar
as
the
findings
relate
to
the
question
whether
these
individuals
were
seamen,
is
there
anything
in
the
findings
other
than
the
statement
at
the
end
of
finding
seven
which
you
think
is
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
does
the
case
boil
down
to
the
question
whether
that
last
sentence,
given
all
the
other
facts,
the
last
sentence,
"each
of
the
plaintiffs'
employment
was
that
of
a
seaman.
"
whether
that's
a
statement
of
fact
or
a
statement
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
mixed,
as
you
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question...
it
really
focuses
on
that
one
sentence.
otherwise,
there's
really
no
dispute,
as
i
understand
you,
about
the
underlying
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct,
that
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
underlying
facts,
only
whether
they
all
add
up
to
the
conclusion
that
these
people
are
seamen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
right,
"which
was
maritime".
but
you
don't
disagree
that
the
services
were
performed
while
the
arctic
star
was
in
navigable
waters?
