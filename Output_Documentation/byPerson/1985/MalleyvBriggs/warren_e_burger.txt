chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
edward
malley
against
briggs.
ms.
sheadel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
sheadel,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
for
a
moment
to
announce
that
justice
prennan
will
be
delayed
in
arriving,
but
will
participate
in
all
the
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
from
that
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
if
the
magistrate
fails
to
do
his
duty
that
failure
can
never
be
attributed
to
the
police
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
immunity
of
the
policeman
here
is
the
derivative
immunity
from
the
judicial
immunity
of
the
magistrate?
he
derives
it
because
he's
executing
an
order
of
a
judicial
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
any
different
from
a
derivative
immunity?
he
derives
it
from
the
judicial
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
isn't
an
independent
immunity
of
a
policeman
as
such.
it's
an
immunity
of
a
judicial
officer
which
is
conferred
upon
the
police
officer
because
the
police
officer
is
doing
what
the
judicial
officer
has
told
him
to
do;
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
affidavit
for
the
warrant
recites
that
it's
a
warrant
to
search
the
premises
of
36
jackson
street
and
the
secretary
for
the
magistrate,
not
the
police
officer,
the
secretary
for
the
magistrate
makes
a
typographical
error
and
puts
in
38
jackson
street.
a
different
officer
executes
the
warrant
from
the
one
who
applied
for
it,
as
is
often
the
case
in
a
large
police
department.
and
they
go
and
search
38
jackson
street,
which
is
a
perfectly
innocent
citizen.
would
the
police
officer
have
immunity
for
the
magistrate's
mistake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
decof.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
about
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
your
friend
on
the
magistrate's
making
a
mistake,
either
he
or
his
secretary,
and
puts
in
38
jackson
street
instead
of
36,
and
then
another
officer,
knowing
nothing
of
the
facts,
goes
and
searches
the
wrong
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
liable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree?
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
are
you
not
holding
the
policeman
responsible
for
the
magistrate's,
for
the
judge's
mistake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he'd
have
to
defend
the
action.
qualified
immunity
simply
requires
him
to
defend
the
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
argument
limited
to
the
case
of
executing
a
warrant
issued
by
a
judicial
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
question:
well,
are
you
suggesting
there's
a
difference
between
lower
and
higher
judicial
officers
with
respect
to
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
been
any
different
on
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
with
a
mistake
in
the
address?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
injury
to
the
person,
to
have
your
home
raided--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--by
the
police
is
a
very
bad
business
for
any
citizen,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
situation
with
the
typographical
error,
is
that
any
different
than
the
situation
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
police
officer
who
gets
the
warrant
should
then
go
to
another
lawyer
and
say,
i
went
to
be
sure
before
i
execute
this
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
want
to
be
sure
that
it's
a
valid
warrant;
will
you
look
at
the
application
and
then
look
at
the
warrant
and
see
if
i'm
protected.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
very
purpose
of
the
magistrate
the
judicial
officer's
intervention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
the
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
sheadel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
