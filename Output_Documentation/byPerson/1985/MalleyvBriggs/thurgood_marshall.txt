justice

counsel,
if
we
go
that
far
is
there
anybody
in
the
state
side
of
the
judicial
process
that
is
not
immune,
absolutely
immune?
you're
starting
with
the
judge.
you're
down
to
the
policeman.
is
there
anybody
that
you
could
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
based
your
argument
that
he
has
the
same
immunity
as
the
prosecutor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
the
same
immunity
that
a
judge
has.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
policeman
has
the
same
immunity,
as
the
judge
has.
and
my
question
is,
is
there
anybody
in
the
process
that
doesn't
have
absolute
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
give
me
great
problems.
you
admit
that
this
was
insufficient
for
a
warrant,
and
yet
the
magistrate
gave
it.
and
now
you
say
the
magistrate
is
not
responsible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
officer
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
officer
is
responsible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
the
officer
has
say
four
points
to
make
to
show
probable
cause
and
he
puts
down
three
and
a
half
points,
he
is
liable
to
civil
action
per
se?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
because
he
left
out
one
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
left
out
half
of
one
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
he
can
be
brought
up
and
carried
through
court
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
does
he
have
to
present
it
to
the
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
is
so
that
the
magistrate
can
determine
whether
it's
sufficient,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
has
to
satisfy
the
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
is
at
his
peril
if
the
magistrate
goes
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
and
the
magistrate
have
made
an
equal
mistake.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he's
responsible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
torts.
