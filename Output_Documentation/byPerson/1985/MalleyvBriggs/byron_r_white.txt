well,
if
you
were
right
on
that
immunity
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
objectives
were,
would
it?
i
mean,
leon
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
your
absolute
immunity
argument
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
qualified
immunity
argument
would
certainly
implicate
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
qualified
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
said
there'd
be
liability
only
if
the
officer
really
should
have
known.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
harlow
test
and
the
leon
test
are
roughly
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
the
jury
or
judge
may
conclude
that
at
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
because
he
thought
the
magistrate's
action
just
insulated,
automatically
insulated,
the
police
officer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
they
remanded
it
for
trial.
but
i
take
it
that
the
district
judge
could
still
say...
could
still
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that,
well,
i
have
looked
at
the
affidavit
and
there
is
no
way
that
the
office
could
have
been
found
to
be
unreasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
still
dismiss
it
under
the
harlow
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it
objectively
reasonable
to
think
that
if
there
isn't
probable
cause
the
magistrate
will
surely
tell
me?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
magistrate
issues
the
warrant,
he
has
told
me
that
my
conduct
is
very
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
only...
but
it
certainly
doesn't
go
any
farther
than
when
he
applies
for
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
simple
at
all
if
magistrates
do
their
job,
which
you
say
that,
obviously
say,
that
they
usually
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
just
making
the
police
pay
for,
the
policeman
pay
for
an
incompetent
magistrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
hold
him,
you
would
make
him
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
the
magistrate
had
done
his
job
he
would
be
off
the
hook.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
there
might
be
a
plus
to
this
from
the
state's
argument,
because
it
would
encourage
police
to
go
to
magistrates
to
get
a
warrant,
rather
than
making
arrests
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
standard
is
the
standard
that
you
think
the
district
judge
will
be
entitled
to
follow
at
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
didn't
think
it
was
a
flagrant
enough
error,
he's
going
to
dismiss
your
case.
