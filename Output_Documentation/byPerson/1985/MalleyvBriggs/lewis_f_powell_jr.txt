justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this
question.
didn't
the
trial
judge,
the
state
trial
judge,
find
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
did
the
appellate
court
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
find?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
directly
from
the
state
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
federal
district
court
all
the
way.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
state
trial
judge
actually
approved
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
didn't
the
face
of
the
warrant
disclose
the
substance
of
the
wiretap
evidence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
state
judge
then
commanded
the
arrest
of
the
defendants,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
interrupt
there.
you
agree
the
magistrate
had
the
same
information
that
the
police
officer
had?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
didn't
sue
him
because--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--of
judicial
immunity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
continue
to
interrupt
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
agree
that
the
officer
at
most
acted
only
negligently,
wouldn't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
he
faithfully
recorded
in
the
affidavit
the
essential
facts
from
the
wiretap.
that
placed
the
briggs
at
parties
at
which
marijuana
was
being
consumed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
yes,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--when
we
get
to
the
constitutional
part,
all
that
he...
he
made
a
mistake
in
judgment,
basically,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
didn't
fabricate
any
facts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
reported
all
the
facts
he
had
to
the
magistrate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
thank
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
decof,
we're
not
giving
you
much
of
a
chance
to
make
your
argument
coherently,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--i'll
ask
you
one
more
question
and
then
try
to
keep
quiet.
would
you
turn
to
page
8
of
your
brief,
please.
this
is
the
first
full
paragraph,
i
guess
the
second
sentence:
"under
the
harlow
standard,
a
police
officer
will
be
shielded
by
good
faith
immunity
unless
his
actions
are
so
flagrant
that
it
can
be
said
that
no
reasonable
police
officer
would
have
acted
in
the
same
way.
"
it's
your
position
in
this
case
that
the
officer
acted
flagrantly?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is?
