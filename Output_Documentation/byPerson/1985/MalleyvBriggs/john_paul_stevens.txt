justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
sort
of
a
hypothetical
question
about
the
extent
of
your
position.
you
take
a
position
that
even
were
it
might
have
been
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
officer
to
apply
for
a
warrant,
that
nevertheless
he
should
be
absolutely
immune
from
civil
liability,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
position,
even
assuming
it's
objectively
unreasonable.
we
had
a
case
on
the
certiorari
list
in
which
the
claim
was
made
that
the
officer
went
in
to
the
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
in
effect
rubber
stamped
the
application
for
a
warrant.
he
said:
i've
seen
you
many,
many
times
before,
officer
whatever
your
name
is,
and
i
know
you're
reliable;
i
don't
even
have
to
read
the
application
because
i
know
your
always
going
to...
you're
not
going
to
come
in
with
an
insufficient
basis.
would
you
say
that
if
the
record
disclosed
that
kind
of
procedure
that
nevertheless
the
officer
should
be
immune
if
he
came
in
with
a
plainly
insufficient
warrant
application?
and
if
so,
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
there
are
falsehoods
in
the
application
for
a
warrant?
same
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
if
i
understand
your
position,
you
would
give,
you
recognize
that
in
leon
some
of
this
evidence
may
be
subject
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
you
would
give
the
guilty
defendant
greater
protection
by
excluding
the
evidence
than
you
will
the
innocent
victim
of
this
kind
of
police
error,
if
i
understand
your
position,
by
not
equating
the
leon
test
to
this
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
argument
rest
on
the
assumption
that
in
filling
out
the
application
for
a
warrant
that
the
police
officer
was
just
doing
what
the
magistrate
told
him
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
this
court
ever
directed
him
to
do
what
was
objectively
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
false
and
deliberately
misleading
the
magistrate,
to
be
immune
for
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
a
case
that
would
be
protected
adequately
by
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
all
of
the
retaliatory
lawsuits
in
this
category
of
litigation
are
by
people
who
are
innocent
of
any
criminal
wrongdoing?
by
hypothesis,
they're
people
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
them
or
to
search
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
at
least
these
are
people
who
are
presumptively
innocent
whereas
in
the
prisoner
category
they're
all
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes,
in
the
exclusionary
rule
cases
they're
all
people
who
were
probably
going
to
be
found
guilty
if
the
evidence
is
not
excluded.
these
plaintiffs
are
all
people
who
are
presumptively
innocent,
of
any
wrongdoing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
decof,
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
clearly
in
agreement
with
what
justice
o'connor
said.
they
said
in
so
many
words,
we
emphasize
that
liability
does
not
attach
simply
because
there's
a
later
determination
of
no
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
two
different
standards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
were--
