mr.
leonard
decof
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
do
a
small
thing,
to
eviscerate
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
hallowed
tribunal
is
the
last
place
i
would
assay
the
mildest
sarcasm
or
the
most
inferential
humor,
but
the
portent
of
petitioners'
proposition
is
so
ominous
that
i
fear
i
don't
have
the
tools
to
combat
it
adequately.
mr.
leonard
decof
under
the
proposition--
mr.
leonard
decof
--under
the
proposition
advanced
by
the
petitioners,
there
would
be
immunity,
there
would
be
absolute
immunity.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
your
honor,
i
dispute
that.
what
i
say
is
what
the
petitioners--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please,
i
believe
in
that
situation
under
the
harlow
objective
doctrine
objective
test,
the
police
would
not
be
held
responsible.
that
test--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
that
test
leaves
ample
room
for
this
kind
of
error.
mr.
leonard
decof
again,
the
purpose
for
harlow
adopting
the
objective
act
was
to
promote
summary
judgment...
the
objective
standard,
was
to
promote
summary
judgment.
for
that
reason,
harlow
discarded
the
old
subjective
test.
i
believe
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
27
of
the
attorneys
general,
led
by
the
attorney
general
of
kinnesota,
opted
for
another
subjective
test,
whether
or
not
there
was
falsity.
harlow
has
said,
and
with
great
force,
that
looking
into
someone's
mind,
finding
out
their
subjective
knowledge,
will
lead
to
an
endless
chain
of
relevant
evidence,
while
an
objective
test
will
force
the
summary
judgment
and
would
be
a
greater
protection
for
the
police,
if
the
court
please.
the
petitioners
is
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
the
petitioner
must
either
say
the
police
are
totally
immune,
which
eviscerates
the
fourth
amendment
because
everything
that
the
police
do
could
be
categorized
as
part
of
the
judicial
function
if
you
follow
the
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
not,
because
in
the
instant
case
here
this
warrant
was
not
executed
by
the
officer
who
was
sued.
the
officer
who
was
sued
applied
for
the
warrant.
the
facts
haven't
been
gone
into
and
i
would
like
to
advert
to
them
because
they're,
important.
the
defendant,
officer
malley,
applied
for
the
warrant
to
a...
not
a
trial
judge,
but
a
district
court
judge,
a
judge
at
the
lowest
level
of
the
state
court
system,
and
presented
an
affidavit
based
on
a
court-authorized
wiretap.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
the
officer
who
issued
the
warrant
was
immune.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
duties
of
the
policeman
are
not
simply
to
drop
anything
and
everything
on
the
magistrate's
desk
and
he
is
shorn
or
insulated
of
all
responsibility
or
liability.
there
are
two
parallel
duties
here,
the
duties
of
the
police
and
the
duties
of
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate
acted
unlawfully.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
and
both
acted
unlawfully.
mr.
leonard
decof
he's
immune.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
point
i'm
making
is
both
committed
unlawful
acts
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
magistrate
is
immune.
two
wrongs
don't
make
a
right.
it
is...
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
the
magistrate's
unlawful
act
should
immunize
the
policeman
in
his
unlawful
act.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
it's
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
from
its
face
the
warrant
exhibited
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
your
honor.
again
we
go
to
the
reasonable
police
officer
standard
adopted
by
harlow,
in
the
harlow
opinion,
and
i
believe
that
allows
ample
room
for
error,
whether
it's
an
honest
error
or
whatever,
if
the
warrant
or
the
affidavit
on
its
face
patently
exhibits
that,
given
all
the
best
inferences,
there
is
no
probable
cause,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
liability.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
first
circuit
applied
the
harlow
test,
your
honor,
and
said
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
here.
we
could
possibly
move
for
a
directed
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
if
we
retried
this
case,
but
it
wouldn't
happen
in
all
cases.
we're
saying
at
least
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
reasonable...
first
of
all,
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
police
was
objectively
reasonable
will
be
determined
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
doesn't
necessarily
foreclose
it.
if
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
fails,
then
there
can
be
a
court
hearing
at
which
a
factual
determination
will
be
made.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
allegation,
allegations
which
if
taken
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
affiant
would
establish
probable
cause.
it's
a
violation
of
the
mandate
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
issue
a
warrant
without
probable
cause.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
say
that
would
be
a
question
to
determine.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
that
leon
has
followed
along
with
the
teaching
of
harlow,
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
he
acted
constitutionally
negligently,
is
what
our
claim
was,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
leonard
decof
we
didn't
claim
there
was
malice
or
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
no
he
didn't.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
they
may,
your
honor,
that's
so.
all
we're
saying
is
that
there
is
enough
here
that
under
the
harlow
test
we
can't
apply
absolute
immunity
and
say
that
there
is
no
way
that
this
case
can
possibly
proceed
to
trial.
we
want
a
hearing
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
negligence
and
whether
that
negligence
was
culpable
so
as
to
justify
a
verdict.
if
the
court
please,
if
the
police
are
immunized...
and
i
submit
that
this
would
immunize
the
police...
for
example,
in
this--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
had--
mr.
leonard
decof
--the
district
court--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor,
he
could
conceivably
say
that
there
was
no
issue
of
triable
fact
to
go
before
a
jury.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes.
and
that
is
the
position
that
the
first
circuit
has
left
us
in.
mr.
leonard
decof
when
the
district
court
dismissed
this
action,
he
did
it
on
the
basis
of
old
first
circuit
cases.
and
subsequent
to
his
dismissing
the
action,
the
first
circuit
came
down
with
another
case
which
followed
harlow,
and
we
moved,
we
reopened
and
brought
this
to
the
judge's
attention,
and
he
still
adhered
to
his
original
decision
based
on
the
discussion
i've
just
had
with
mr.
justice
white.
if...
i'd
like
to
stress
the
fact
again,
if
the
court
please,
the
police
on
the
basis
of
one
statement
from
an
unknown
informant
which
came
over
a
wiretap,
to
wit,
"i
couldn't
believe
i
saw
jimmy.
"
--this
was
not
an
informant,
excuse
me;
an
unknown
person...
to
wit,
"i
couldn't
believe
i
saw
jimmy
briggs
tokin.
"
obtained
a
warrant,
had
mr.
briggs
and
his
wife,
two
prominent
members
of
the
community,
arrested
at
quarter
of
6:00
in
the
morning
in
their
home.
there
couldn't
be
a
more
dramatic
illustration
of
the
problems
or
of
the
sacrosanct
nature
of
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
than
this.
it
stirs
up
memories
or
specters
of
jackboots.
mr.
leonard
decof
if
the
court
please,
if
there
had
been
a
mistake
in
the
address,
under
the
qualified
immunity
rule
of
harlow,
the
police
either
at
filing
of
affidavits
to
this
effect
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
probably
get
a
summary
judgment,
or
at
the
very
least,
if
the
matter
went
to
trial
on
the
facts
they
would
be
found
to
be
not
responsible.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
so,
your
honor
because--
mr.
leonard
decof
--we
don't
take
the
obverse
of
the
coin
from
the
attorney
general
of
rhode
island
and
say
that
there
should
be
absolute
liability.
the
police
are
not
insurers
for
their
mistakes.
what
we're
saying
is
that
a
reasonable
man
test
should
be
applied,
and
if
a
reasonable...
in
my
opinion,
on
your
honor's
hypothesis,
this
would
have
been
a
reasonable
mistake
made.
it's
very
different
from
a
policeman
looking
at
a
warrant
which
says,
go
down
and
arrest
everybody
wearing
a
red
tie.
there
obviously
is
no
probable
cause.
so
that's
why
all
of
the
protections
that
are
necessary
for
the
police
are
there.
they
are
geared
into
the
harlow
rule,
the
objective
standard.
if
the
court
please,
my
colleague
urges
that
the
police
function
is
prosecutorial.
this
court
has
always
used
the
functional
analysis
and
has
held
judges
and
prosecutors
and
legislators
in
the
legislative
function
to
be
immune.
in
imbler
this
court
held
that
the
prosecutor
was
immune,
but
left
open
the
question
of
whether
this
immunity
attached
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
office
or
by
nature
of
the
function.
later
on
in
mitchell,
i
think...
although
the
court
did
refer
to
other
cases
which
had
not
extended
immunity
to
every
phase,
later
on
mitchell
this
court
decided
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
was
not
immune
in
everything
he
did,
that
it
had
to
be
connected
with
the
judicial
function.
and
the
reason
for
this,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
so
eloquently
stated,
is
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process.
it's
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
judicial
process
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
given
immunity.
he
must
be
free
to
act.
and
this
protects
defendants
as
well
as
the
public.
it
protects
the
public
because
he's
not
fettered
in
bringing
actions.
it
protects
defendants
because
he
doesn't
have
to
fear
being
sued
civilly
and
thus
refrain
from
dismissing
an
action
once
trial
has
started.
and
it
also
protects
the
defendant
in
giving
freedom
to
the
reviewing
judge,
who
might
even
subconsciously
react
knowing
that
if
he
turned
the
case
over
the
prosecuting
attorney
could
be
immune
from
suit.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
your
honor.
all
we
urge
the
court
is
that
the
harlow
rule,
which
is
a
sensible
rule
and
says
that
the
police
officer
should
do
what
any
reasonably
trained
police
officer
would
do,
be
followed.
this
doesn't
include
going
to
a
lawyer.
but
the
converse
of
that,
if
we
insulate
or
immunize
the
police,
they
won't
have
any
standards
that
they
have
to
comply
with
at
all.
we
might
as
well
just
not
train
them.
anybody
could
be
a
policeman
and
go
out
getting
warrants
and
arresting
people,
because
there
is
no
compulsion
for
them
to
comply
with
the
mandates
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
and
this
is
why
i
say
it's
a
circular
or
syllogistic
argument
for
the
attorney
general
to
say
first
this
court
in
its
wisdom
has
fostered
application
to
a
magistrate
to
protect
the
individual
who
will
be
arrested;
at
the
same
time,
how
can
that
application
to
the
magistrate,
which
is...
in
fact
in
this
case
was
required;
it's
not
a
voluntary
action...
how
can
that
serve
to
insulate
the
policeman
from
liability
from
an
unlawful
act?
it's
a
circular
argument,
because
when
the
policeman
does
what
he's
required
to
do
and
goes
to
the
magistrate,
he
is
insulated.
mr.
leonard
decof
if
the
set
of
facts...
he
must
act
reasonably
in
submitting
this
set
of
facts.
he
can't
just
issue
complaints
willy-nilly.
he
can't
decide
he
is
going
to
get
out
arrest
warrants
for
100
people
who
are
going
to
be
gathered
in
an
auditorium
because
there
might
be
some
drug
peddlers
there.
and
that
would
be
an
unlawful
action.
it's
not
unlawful
for
him
to
submit
an
affidavit
and
a
complaint
to
a
magistrate
so
long
as
his
action
is
objectively
reasonable.
that
is,
there
is
reasonable
belief
that...
reason
to
believe
that
there
his
probable
cause.
mr.
leonard
decof
because,
if
the
court
please--
mr.
leonard
decof
--then
we
relieve
the
police
of
all
responsibility
and
make
them
nothing
but
messengers
and,
as
i
said,
anybody--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please,
he
then
has
a
very
simple
way
to
escape
liability
and
to
conduct
his
business,
and
with
the
best
of--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes.
if
the
court
please,
in
this
case
22
warrants
were
presented
to
the
magistrate
at
the
same
time,
but
we
haven't
argued
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
his
job.
this
court
has
said
we
assume
them
to
do
their
job,
although
sometimes
there
are
abuses.
there
are
rubber
stamp
situations.
there
are
situations
where
under
the
press
of
time
a
great
many
magistrates...
a
great
many
complaints
fall
on
the
magistrate's
desk,
where
he
knows
the
police
officer,
knows
him
to
be
responsible.
but
what
i'm
urging
is
that
it
creates
a
dangerous
condition,
a
police
state
condition,
where
the
police,
even
for
the
best
of
motives,
for
expediency,
for
saving
of
time,
would
not
pause
to
consider.
and
this
court
said--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
if
the
court
please,
the
policeman
is
not
paying
for
an
incompetent
magistrate
unless
you
accept--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
if
the
court
please.
he
is
only
paying
for
his
own
negligence,
his
own
constitution
negligence.
mr.
leonard
decof
but
if
the
court
please,
it
isn't
the
magistrate...
the
magistrate
is
a
governing
factor,
of
course,
and
the
purpose
that
the
magistrate
is
there
and
he
should
be
sought
to
is
to
protect
the
individual.
and
as
imbler
said,
if
there's
no
case
against
the
police,
there
is
no
case.
in
this
situation,
there
are
two
separate
actors.
the
magistrate
is
acting
and
the
police
is
acting,
and
i
don't
know
how
we
can
obscure
the
fact
or
avoid
the
fact
that
the
policeman
has
a
set
of
standards
to
go
by.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
but
again
this
court
has
spoken
to
that
and
also
encouraged
it.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
required.
one
of
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
is
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
the
same
as
if
the
police
had
arrested
without
a
warrant
or
with
a
warrant
from
the
procedure,
because
whether
he
is
arrested
with
a
warrant
or
without
a
warrant
there
has
to
be
a
criminal
indictment
followed
either
by
a
grand
jury
or
a
prosecutorial
information.
so
the
procedure--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
welcome
your
honor's
questions.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
our
position
is
that
this
warrant
was
so
patently
without
probable
cause
on
its
face
that
any
reasonable
police
officer
would
have
known
so.
we
go
further,
if
the
court...
the
complete
wiretap
is
not
part
of
the
evidence,
but
the
only
pertinent
part
is
the
one
statement,
"i
couldn't
believe
i
saw
jimmy
briggs
toking.
"
the
police
procedure,
the
transcript
will
show,
is
to
mark
something
as
incriminating
or
not
incriminating.
and
we
believe
that
the
negligence
went
all
the
way
back
to
marking
this,
this
portion
of
the
wiretap
as
incriminating,
this
and
nothing
more.
mr.
leonard
decof
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
exactly,
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
he's
liable,
but
he--
mr.
leonard
decof
--he's
liable
to
action.
he
may
not
be
found
to
have
been
constitutionally
negligent.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
he
should
not
have
absolute
immunity.
mr.
leonard
decof
i'm
sorry?
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
reason--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
an
added
protection
for
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
charged.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
point--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
again,
if
there
are
two
joint
tortfeasors,
you
don't
solve
the
problem
if
one
is
unavailable
by
letting
the
other
one
go.
if
there
are
two
persons
who
have
acted
independently,
each
performing
his
own
separate
duties
and
separate
functions--
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
in
this
situation
there
are
two
separate
wrongs
that
have
been
done.
the
magistrate
is
held
immune
because
of
the
law.
there
is
no
other
alternative
for
the
injured
party
but
to
go
to
the
police
officer.
i
believe
that
it
logically
follows
that,
because
there
have
been
two
wrongs,
because
the
magistrate
has
done
a
wrong,
that
his
wrong
should
allow
the
policeman
to
be
freed
of
liability
for
his
wrong.
and
i
would
follow
this,
your
honor,
by
stating
that
again
all
we're
saying
is
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
have
this
matter
heard
before
a
judge,
and
if
he
decides
that
there
should
not
be
dismissal,
then
that
it
go
before
a
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
actually
the
police
officer
is
culpable.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
but
we
didn't
pursue
that.
the
only--
mr.
leonard
decof
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
only
good
faith
that
we'd
be
talking
about
is
the
objective
standard
of
good
faith
that
has
been
announced
in
harlow.
if
the
court
please,
in
briscoe,
i
think
that
briscoe
gives
us
an
answer
to
the
petitioners'
claim
that
the
police
functions
here
are
judicial.
in
briscoe
a
policeman
was
given
absolute
immunity
because
he
was
a
witness.
now,
if
he
had
immunity
by
virtue
of
his
investigative
functions
or
the
functions
we're
talking
about
here,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
recite
that
the
reason
he
was
given
absolute
immunity
was
because
he
was
a
witness.
and
again,
that
is
part
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
immunity
or
the
functions
analysis
has
been
used.
that
is,
protection
of
the
fairness
of
the
system,
protection
of
the
judicial
process.
the
judicial
team
is
the
judge,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
witnesses.
now,
the
petitioner
wants
this
to
be
expanded
to
a
situation
where
the
police
will
be
held
as
part
of
the
judicial
team.
and
i
must
take
issue
with
my
colleague's
statement
that
this
is
only
one
small
part
of
the
police
duties.
i
think
the
police
duties...
the
issue
we're
talking
about
is
pervasive.
and
if
you
said
that
investigating
the
case
and
having
that
investigation
culminate
in
application
for
a
warrant
is
part
of
the
judicial
function
or
the
judicial
process,
then
most
of
what
a
policeman
does
will
be
immune,
because
the
investigation
begins
with
the
arrest
and
the
arrest
begins
with
statements
from
other
people,
or
may
not.
and
again,
we
open
the
door
wide
and
we
have
a
police
state.
if
the
court
please,
at
common
law,
our
court
has
stated
time
and
time
again,
there
was
no
absolute
immunity
for
police,
and
i
cannot
accept
my
colleague's
statement
that
this
is
limited
to
one
small
instance.
as
i
said,
once
you
say
that
either
by
application
for
a
warrant
the
police
are
insulated
or
that
the
police
in
doing
this
are
performing
a
prosecutorial
or
judicial
function,
then
you
open
up
the
door
wide
to
virtually
everything
that
a
policeman
does.
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
with
due
respect,
that
that
would
beg
the
question,
because
you're
saying
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
police...
again,
in
this
case
we're
not
talking
about
the
policeman
who
executed
it;
we're
talking
about
the
policeman
who
applied.
but
what
i
say
is
that
the
evil
of
accepting
the
insulation
theory
is
that
you
open
the
door
wide,
and
if
you're
going
to
insulate
the
policeman
by
virtue
of
the
magistrate's
issuing
the
warrant
then
it
will
insulate
the
applying
officer,
it
will
insulate
the
executing
officer,
and
there
will
just
be
no
holds
barred.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
warrant
process.
i
submit
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
one
of
the
most
critical
functions
that
the
police
perform.
thank
you.
