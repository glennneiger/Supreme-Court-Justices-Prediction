justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
circuit
said
that
your
client
should
have
qualified
immunity,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
alternative...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sheadel,
justice
stevens
asked
you
if
a
guilty
defendant
would
fare
better
than
the
innocent
defendant
under
your
test.
i
take
it
any
defendant,
any
criminal
defendant
suing,
no
matter
what
the
fate
of
the
evidence
in
his
trial,
would
lose
in
a
suit
against
the
police
officer
under
you
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
absence
of
probable
cause
sufficient
to
defeat
the
harlow
test
for
qualified
immunity?
i
mean,
in
a
lot
of
situations,
such
as
we
were
dealing
with
in
leon,
we
contemplated
a
situation
where
the
actions
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
could
be
objectively
reasonable
and
still
not...
still
wrong
legally.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
i
take
it
either
if
there's
probable
cause
everyone
is
off
the
hook
and
if
there
isn't
probable
cause,
even
if
it
may
be
kind
of
a
then
the
police
officer
is
liable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
first
circuit
say
only
that
there
was
no
probable
cause,
or
also
that
whatever
the
standard
is
no
reasonable
person
could
have
thought
them
was
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
unlawful
about
the
magistrate...
about
the
policeman
submitting
to
the
magistrate
a
set
of
facts
for
the
magistrate's
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
reasoning
for
reversing
the
first
circuit
here
would
be
that
the
police
officer
simply
submitted
it
for
the
magistrate's
judgment
and
it
was
reasonable
for
him
to
execute
something
that
had
been
approved
by
the
magistrate,
that
reasoning
wouldn't
apply
at
all
to
police
making
arrests
or
making
searches
without
warrants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
only
in
the
warrant
process.
