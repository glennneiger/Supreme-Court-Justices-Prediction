day
o'connor
ms.
sheadel,
do
you
concede
that
the
facts
that
were
available
here
were
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
would
assume
for
a,
moment
that
the
facts
were
insufficient
to
amount
to
probable
cause
and
if
the
warrant
had
issued
and
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
it,
would
the
evidence
be
excludable
in
your
view
under
the
leon
case
at
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
should
a
different
rule
apply
than
in
insulating
the
officer
from
any
damage
liability
than
the
rule
that
would
be
applied
for
exclusion
of
evidence
under
leon?
why
shouldn't
these
two
track
each
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
leon
was
there
not
some
indication
that
perhaps
deterrence
is
a
valid
objective
if
the
police
officer's
reliance
on
the
warrant
is
objectively
unreasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
decof,
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
here
has
been
fully
resolved
and
is
not
an
issue
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
decof,
can
i
pursue
this
question
just
a
little
bit
to
see
if
i
understand
you.
for
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
in
the
leon
case
the
court
referred
to
a
reliance
by
a
police
officer
on
a
warrant
if
it's
in
good
faith
and
objectively
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
that
necessarily
always
the
same
as
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
probable
cause
existed?
can't
you
have
an
objectively
reasonable
reliance
on
something
that
does
not
establish
in
fact
legal
probable
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
decof,
you
also
made
a
claim,
i
believe,
below
that
the
petitioner
acted
maliciously
and
in
bad
faith,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
intend
to
when
it
goes
back?
that's
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
