ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
this
court
is
faced
with
the
question
of
the
extent
of
a
police
officer's
civil
liability
for
damages
resulting
from
an
arrest
made
pursuant
to
a
warrant
which
the
police
officer
sought
and
obtained
from
a
natural
and
detached
magistrate.
specifically,
can
a
police
officer
who
applied
for
and
obtained
an
arrest
warrant
face
civil
liability
for
damages
on
the
theory
that
he
should
have
known
that
the
facts
recited
in
the
affidavit
submitted
to
the
magistrate
were
insufficient
to
establish
probable
cause?
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
ask
this
court
to
find
that
a
police
officer
cannot
be
amenable
to
suit
in
such
a
situation,
but
rather
that
he
is
in
fact
immune,
from
liability.
in
this
context,
the
police
officer's
actions
should
be
protected
from
suit
for
the
same
reasons,
the
same
policy
concerns,
that
have
teen
enunciated
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
regarding
immunity
and
where
to
draw
the
line
between
immune
actions
and
non-immune
actions.
in
deciding
where
to
draw
such
a
line,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
answer
must
be
found
in
a
balance
between
the
evils
inevitable
in
either
alternative,
recognizing
that
in
any
balance
drawn
not
all
interests
can
be
protected.
in
such
a
balance,
the
court
has
recognized
that
on
the
one
hand
it
is
trying
to
vindicate
constitutional
rights,
while
on
the
other
hand
it
is
trying
to
protect
officials
who
are
required
to
exercise
discretion
in
fulfilling
their
duties.
in
determining
the
extent
of
any
such
immunity,
the
court
has
considered
two
factors.
the
first
factor
considered
by
the
court
has
been
the
function
performed
by
the
official
in
question
and
the
historical
extent
of
the
immunity
that's
been
granted
to
that
function.
the
second
consideration
has
been
the
policies
that
exist
in
applying
that
immunity
to
the
action
at
question.
in
applying
this
standard
to
this
case,
the
function
that
we're
examining
is
the
function
of
police
officer
in
applying
to
a
magistrate
for
an
arrest
warrant,
and
the
question
then
becomes
should
this
function
receive
a
full
exemption
from
liability.
we
believe
that
this
function
should
receive
a
full
exemption
from
liability.
our
primary
argument
about
the
functional
analysis
of
the
police
officer
applying
to
a
magistrate
for
an
arrest
warrant
is
that
the
function
that
the
police
officer
is
performing
is
very
similar
to
the
function
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
in
placing
information
before
a
grand
jury
and
asking
the
grand
jury
to
find
that
probable
cause
exists
and
to
indict.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
would
not
concede
that
there
was
absence
of
probable
cause
in
this
case,
your
honor.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
whether
or
not
this
court
believes
that
probable
cause
existed
would
be
determinative
in
the
case.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
using
the
leon
case,
it's
possible
the
evidence
could
be
excluded.
again,
the
leon
factors
are
such
that
it
would
require
a
very
specific
analysis
of
the
situation
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that
the
two
rules
are
synonymous.
in
fact,
in
its
analysis
it
appears
that
the
court
has
considered
some
different
factors.
if
in
fact
the
rules
were
going
to
be
synonymous,
it
would
appear
to
us
that
it
would
question
a
magistrate's
immunity
from
civil
liability
because
the
magistrate
is
involved
in
the
decision
to
issue
the
search
warrant
or
the
arrest
warrant.
and
if
we
were
tracking
the
exclusionary
rule,
it
would
seem
that,
since
the
magistrate
made
a
decision
that
shouldn't
have
been
made,
then
it
would
require
some
kind
of
analysis
of
the
magisterial
exemption
from
liability.
we
believe
that--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--yes,
i
believe
that
was
indicated
in
leon.
in
the
civil
liability
aspect,
the
court
has
looked
at
the
question
of
deterrence
of
one
of
the
factors
considered
in
whether
or
not
immunity
should
be
applied.
instead
of
using
the
word
"deterrence,
i
think
more
often
the
court
will
look
at
if
there
are
adequate
safeguards
other
than
civil
liability
or
if
there
are
things
the
court
might
call
alternative
remedies.
"
"that
has
been
a
policy
consideration
of
the
court
in
its
civil
liability
analysis.
"
what
the
court
has
looked
at
whenever
it
has
granted
immunity
to
an
official
within
the
judicial
process
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there
are
these
alternatives
available,
the
court
has
considered
such
things
as
being
within
the
judicial
process
and
the
checks
and
balances
that
are
inherent
in
that
process.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
that's
right.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
as
far
as
the
absolute
immunity
is
concerned.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
there
was
no
finding
made
on
probable
cause,
your
honor,
at
all
at
the
trial
level.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
the
case
went
before
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
first--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--it
was
not
a
state
trial.
it
was
a
trial
in
the
federal
district
court.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes.
and
then
it
went
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
first
circuit
made
one
statement
in
its
opinion
that
probable
cause
was
lacking,
but
it
did
not
elucidate
on
that
or
go
into
any
detail
on
why
it
made
that
decision.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
oh,
yes
the
arrest
warrant
was
approved
by
the
state
judge,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
it
did.
it
disclosed
everything
that
had
been
recorded
on
the
wiretap
log.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that,
using
the
court's
analysis
that
the
court
has
traditionally
used
for
absolute
immunity,
that
in
fact
for
the
function
that
we're
talking
about
this
court
should
look
to
an
absolute
immunity
standard.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
function
performed
by
the
police
officer
in
this
occasion
was
the
function
performed
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
asking
the
grand
jury
to
indict.
that
function
has
historically
been
granted
absolute
immunity
and
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts.
we
believe
that
these
functions
are
very
similar
for
several
reasons.
first,
both
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
police
officer
are
required
to
use
a
discretionary
judgment
based
on
their
evidence
in
their
possession
on
where
they're
going
to
take
this
case
at
this
point.
the
prosecuting
attorney
decides
to
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
ask
the
grand
jury
to
decide
if
probable
cause
exists.
the
police
officer
decides
to
go
to
the
magistrate
and
ask
the
magistrate
whether
probable
cause
for
arrest
exists.
both
of
these
decisions
put
the
question
into
the
judicial
proceeding,
in
two
ways.
the
first
way
is
by
putting
that
actual
determination
of
probable
cause
into
the
judicial
proceeding,
asking
a
neutral
and
detached
body
in
the
judicial
process
to
make
that
decision,
the
magistrate
of
course
being
the
neutral
and
detached
body
that
the
police
officer
is
seeking
review
from
and
the
grand
jury
being
the
neutral
and
detached
body
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
seeking
review
from.
the
second
way
that
it's
brought
into
the
criminal
proceedings
is
that
if
the
grand
jury
decides
to
indict
and
if
the
magistrate
decides
to
issue
the
warrant,
criminal
prosecution
has
begun
and
criminal
proceedings
have
begun,
with
all
of
the
checks
and
balances,
all
of
the
protections
inherent
in
those
criminal
proceedings.
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
function
of
the
police
officer
and
the
function
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
are
so
similar
that
the
immunity
granted
to
a
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
function
that
he
performs
should
also
be
applied
to
the
police
officer
in
this
situation.
we
believe
that
the
court's
policy
reasons
for
applying
immunity
also
apply
in
this
case.
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
apply
immunity,
the
court
has
considered
several
policy
factors,
and
we
believe
those
policy
factors
can
be
summarized
in
three
areas.
one
area,
the
first
area,
is
whether
or
not
the
action
occurred
within
judicial
proceedings.
the
second
is
whether
or
not
the
action
taken
is
likely
to
result
in
retaliatory
lawsuits.
and
the
third
is
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
safeguards
to
establish
the
accountability
of
the
official.
the
court's
policy
concerns
first
center
around
whether
or
not
the
action
occurs
within
the
judicial
proceedings.
in
every
case
when
the
court
has
granted
any
kind
of
absolute
immunity,
it
has
always
been
within
the
judicial
process,
except
of
course
for
that
instance
in
which
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
granted
immunity
because
of
his
very
special
and
unique
function
in
our
system
of
government.
but
in
every
other
case,
absolute
immunity
has
been
granted
because
of
an
action
that
has
occurred
within
the
judicial
process.
the
court
has
stated
that
it
is
very
concerned
to
make
sure
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
is
insulated
from
lawsuit,
that
the
actors
in
the
judicial
process
should
be
free
to
act
on
their
own
convictions
without
fear
of
damages
liability.
the
court
has
encouraged
and
has
stated
the
need
for
principled
and
fearless
decisionmaking,
wanting
the
official
in
question
to
put
energy
and
effort
into
the
duties
of
his
office
rather
than
diverting
them
to
fight
off
lawsuits
that
may
be
filed.
the
court
has
felt
that
these
interests
are
especially
involved
in
the
proper
administration
of
justice
and
that
there
is
a
need
to
avoid
the
adverse
effect
in
the
functioning
of
the
criminal
justice
system
that
less
than
this
immunity
would
in
fact
allow.
we
believe,
of
course,
that
this
is
inherent
in
the
situation
in
this
case
because,
as
we
have
said,
this
instance,
this
action,
is
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding,
the
question
and
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
being
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process
and
any
criminal
proceedings
that
would--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--that
would
be
the
full
extent
of
the
absolute
immunity
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
believe
that
the
court's
analysis
in
civil
liability
would
in
fact
give
the
officer
in
your
hypothetical
situation
absolute
immunity,
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
has
given
the
magistrate
absolute
immunity
for
that
kind
of
function,
or
the
same
reason
that
it
has
given
the
prosecuting
attorney
absolute
immunity.
the
court
has
not
distinguished
in
those
situations
where
a
magistrate
or
a
prosecuting
attorney
has
done
something
that
would
be
considered
objectively
unreasonable.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
that's
a
question
that
we
have
not
asked
the
court
to
directly
address
in
this
case,
since
it
is
not
raised.
however,
we
understand
that
there
would
be
concerns
about
this.
again,
looking
at
the
traditional
analysis,
falsehoods
would
be
absolutely
immune.
we
recognize
that
there
are
concerns
with
police
officers
that
might
not
exist
with
prosecuting
attorneys
or
judges
about
these
falsehoods.
but
again,
looking
at
the
traditional
analysis
we
would
say
that
in
the
traditional
analysis
the
police
officer
should
be
immune.
if
this
court
did
feel
there
were
policy
concerns
because
the
police
officer
in
fact
is
dealing
with
people
in
the
community
on
a
much
more
day
to
day
basis
than
prosecutors
or
judges
or
had
some
other
policy
concern
for
that,
we
feel
that
that
issue
would
not
be
addressed
by
this
case
and
would
not
have
to
in
fact
be
addressed
by
the
court
to
define
the
immunity
situation
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
we
would
make
a
certain
distinction
between
search
warrants
and
arrest
warrants.
but
obviously,
if
a
person
is
arrested
and
there
were
evidence
that
were
found,
the
exclusionary
rule
might
come
into
play.
but
the
liability
on
civil
damages
has
always
been
seen
as
being
different
than
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
judge
who
issues
the
warrant,
for
example,
may
have
been
objectively
unreasonable
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
just
gave.
a
judge
who
does
not
review
the
affidavit,
but
rubber
stamps,
could
be
seen
to
be
objectively
unreasonable.
but
that
has
not
changed
this
court's
analysis
in
deciding
that
that
judge
should
in
fact
have
absolute
immunity.
i
think
our
system
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
more
often
than
not
magistrates
are
going
to
be
doing
their
job.
i
think
we
have
to
base
any
rule
that
we
come
up
with
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
conscientious
individuals,
actors
in
the
judicial
process,
that
are
in
fact
doing
the
job
that
they
have
been
appointed
or
elected
to
do.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
that
is
exactly
our
position,
that
it
is
the
magistrate's
responsibility
here
to
review
the
application
for
the
arrest
warrant.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
if
the
magistrate
in
fact
does
not
do
his
job
correctly
or
is
objectively
unreasonable,
we
would
say
that
is
something
that
is
not
the
police
officer's
fault.
the
same
reasons
for
insulating
that
magistrate,
even
though
he
may
be
objectively
unreasonable,
are
the
reasons
for
insulating
other
actors
within
the
judicial
phase
of
the
proceedings,
including
we
believe
in
this
instance
the
police
officer.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
would
lose
for
civil
damages.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
policy
considerations
for
alternatives
that
are
available,
the
court
has
recognized
that
civil
damages
are
not
always
available
for
a
wrong
that
is
done.
and
when
it
has
looked
at
alternative
safeguards,
it
has
said
that
it
is
looking
not
for
an
alternative
that
is
functionally
synonymous
with
civil
damages,
but
looking
to
see
what
safeguards
are
inherent
in
the
system.
one
of
those
safeguards
inherent
in
the
system
is
in
fact
that
you
are
part
of
the
judicial
system.
that
is
very
important
tn
analyzing
what
kind
of
safeguards
or
remedies
are
available
to
the
individuals
in
question.
we
believe
that
the
safeguards
in
this
situation
are
the
same
safeguards
that
exist
for
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
may
be
objectively
unreasonable
in
his
presentation
to
the
grand
jury.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
well,
i
should
clarify
that
we're
not
asking
for
absolute
immunity
for
every
action
that
a
police
officer
would
take,
but
only
for
an
action
that
we
feel
is
so
intimately
involved
in
the
process.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
your
honor.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
none
that
i
can
think
of
right
now,
because
the
court
has
recognized
absolute
immunity
for
judges,
prosecutors,
grand
jurors,
witnesses.
and
for
this
very
limited
function
we're
saying
that
the
police
officer's
function
is
so
a
part
of
these
proceedings
that
it
should
be
granted
the
same
kind
of
immunity.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
it
could
be
seen
as
derivative,
although
we
would
prefer
to
call
it
the
quasi-judicial
immunity,
the
phrase
that
this
court
has
used
whenever
it
has
extended
immunity
within
a
judicial
proceeding,
saying
that
the
immunity
is
considered
to
be
quasi-judicial
because
it
is
of
such
a
nature
within
the--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
does
in
fact
take
it
from
the
fact
that
he
is
part
of--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
that
is
correct.
and
beyond
that,
the
police
officer
is
doing
what
is
constitutionally
required
and
what
this
court
has
directed
it
to
do
by
going
to
the
magistrate
for
the
magistrate's
review.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
no,
your
honor.
that's
why
i
was
continuing
to
say
that
i
believe
that
the
police
officer
in
filling
out
the
affidavit
is
doing
what
this
court
has
directed
it
to
do.
if
he
has
any
question
about
probable
cause
or
if
he's
within
circumstances
in
which
he--

ann
m.

ms.

well,
of
course
the
court
has
never
directed
anyone
within
the
judicial
process
to
be
unreasonable
or
objectively
unreasonable
or
false.
the
court
obviously
is
directing
people
to
act
in
what
the
court
defines
as
constitutional
as
required
in
the
system.
but
that
directive
never
changes
the
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
individual
who's
within
the
system
is
immune.
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
the
witness
may
in
fact
act
objectively
unreasonable.
but
the
court
has
decided
that
the
policy
considerations
of
being
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding
are
so
important
that
the
officer,
the
actor
within
that
proceeding,
will
be
given
absolute
immunity.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
the
police
officer
who
executes
the
warrant,
your
honor?
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
police
officer
was
acting,
even
not
in
an
absolute
immunity
context,
but
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner.
it
certainly
is
objectively
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
warrant
that
has
been
issued
by
the
magistrate
is
valid.
when
you
have
a
typographical
error
that
the
police
officer
had
no
input
in
at
all,
it
would
seem
to
be
a
classic
case
where
the
police
officer
was
acting
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes.
i
would
emphasize
that,
that
we
do
see
some
policy
differences
between
a
warrant
for
an
arrest
and
a
warrant
for
a
search.
the
policy
considerations
that
the
court
has
identified
for
considering
whether
or
not
absolute
immunity
should
apply
don't
seem
to
apply
to
the
same
extent
to
an
application
for
a
search
warrant.
primarily,
our
feeling
is
that,
because
the
search
warrant
does
not
put
the
issue
into
the
judicial
proceedings
in
the
same
way
as
an
application
for
an
arrest
warrant
would,
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
the
court
has
looked
for
in
its
immunity
analysis
may
not
be
present.
we
don't
believe
that
issue
needs
to
he
decided
by
the
court
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
but
we
do
realize
that
there
might
be
some
different
kind
of
policy
concerns
in
an
application
for
an
arrest
warrant...
i
mean,
for
a
search
warrant,
that
do
not
exist
in
an
application
for
an
arrest
warrant.
the
second
policy
consideration
that
the
court
has
identified
is
whether
the
official's
actions
are
likely
to
result
in
retaliatory
lawsuits.
this
is
important
to
the
court,
especially
within
the
judicial
process,
because
the
court
feels
that
within
the
judicial
process
there
are
cases
that
arouse
the
most
intense
feelings
in
the
litigants
and
these
feelings
are
not
easily
capped
by
a
judicial
decree
or
decision.
the
power
of
the
state
is
being
exercised
in
the
courtroom
or
in
the
judicial
process,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
natural
that
there
will
be
resentment,
that
there
will
be
intense
emotions
involved
in
whatever
decision
is
made.
and
because
of
that,
because
of
that
intense
there
is
the
possibility
of
scores
of
lawsuit
emotion,
or
at
least
lawsuits
with
a
great
deal
of
frequency.
the
court
is
concerned
about
this
because,
of
course,
it
does
not
wish
the
judicial
officer
or
the
actor
in
the
judicial
process
to
spend
enormous
amounts
of
time
defending
suits
instead
of
doing
the
official's
judicial
acts.
fear
of
retaliatory
lawsuits
we
believe
is
just
as
clear
in
an
instance
of--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
may
not
have
ever
been
decided.
if,
for
example,
an
individual
is
arrested
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
decides
in
his
discretion
that
he's
not
going
to
pursue
the
case
to
the
grand
jury
for
different
reasons...
he
may
find
trouble
finding
witnesses
or
he
may
decide
that
prosecutorial
economy
would
require
that
they
just
don't,
have
time
to
focus
on
this
kind
of
case,
or
whatever
the
discretionary
decision
is...
no
decision
has
been
made
on
the
fact
that
probable
cause
did
not
exist.
we
believe
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
any
time
someone
is
arrested,
but
the
procedure
is
not--
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
--right,
and
i
would
say
that
the
same
would
be
true
for
a
prosecutor
that
gets
an
indictment
from
a
grand
jury
and
then
the
case
never
proceeds
any
further
or
the
person
is
ultimately
exonerated
in
some
way.
certainly
that
concern
is
the
same
concern
that
you've
expressed
for
the
police
officer,
because
it
could
be
that
someone
says,
i've
been
innocent
but
i've
been
wronged.
the
court
has
still
looked
at
the
policy
considerations
to
decide
whether
or
not
immunity
should
in
fact
apply
in
this
situation.
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
ann
m.
sheadel
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
this
court's
policy
considerations
that
it
has
enunciated
in
support
of
applying
immunity
apply
in
this
case
to
support
not
only
absolute
immunity,
but
qualified
immunity
as
well.
we
believe
that
under
the
harlow
objectively
reasonable
standard
qualified
immunity
should
be
applied
in
this
situation
to
state
that
a
police
officer
who
applies
to
a
magistrate
for
a
warrant
is
per
se
reasonable
if
the
only
allegation
is
that
the
police
officer
should
have
known
that
the
facts
recited
in
his
affidavit
were
insufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
we
believe
that
the
court's
policy
considerations
mandate
this
result
and
that
the
first
circuit
standard
is
unworkable.
the
first
circuit
standard,
being
that
the
police
officer
should
be
liable
for
civil
damages
if
he
should
have
known
that
the
facts
recited
in
his
affidavit
were
insufficient
to
establish
probable
cause,
will
in
fact
require
the
reviewing
court
to
examine
each
case
to
decide,
first
of
all,
if
probable
cause
did
in
fact
exist;
and
second
of
all,
if
it
did
not
exist,
whether
a
police
officer
should
have
known
that
it
did
not
exist.
we
believe
that
the
court's
policy
considerations
looking
at
being
part
of
the
judicial
proceeding,
encouraging
and
wanting
the
police
officer
to
apply
to
the
magistrate
for
an
arrest
warrant,
the
policy
considerations
of
looking
at
the
safeguards
that
are
part
of
this
procedure,
all
go
toward
accepting
the
rule
that
applying
to
a
magistrate
for
an
arrest
warrant
is
in
fact
per
se
reasonable.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
standard
will
eviscerate
the
fourth
amendment.
we
do
believe
that
this
standard
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
court
in
encouraging
police
officers
to
apply
to
magistrates
for
warrants.
therefore,
in
conclusion,
we
urge
this
court
to
rule
that
a
police
officer
who
applies
to
a
magistrate
for
an
arrest
warrant
cannot
be
held
liable
for
civil
damages
if
the
only
allegation
is
that
he
should
have
known
that
the
facts
recited
in
his
affidavit
were
not
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
for
arrest.
