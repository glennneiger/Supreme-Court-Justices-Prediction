mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
members
of
an
institutional
disciplinary
committee
who
are
responsible
for
adjudicating
charges
that
federal
inmates
have
committed
violations
of
prison
rules
may
be
sued
for
damages
by
inmates
who
were
dissatisfied
with
the
results
of
these
disciplinary
hearings.
now,
this
is
a
somewhat
narrow
legal
issue
in
some
respects
but
it
is
of
extreme
practical
importance
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
the
operation
of
the
federal
prison
system.
there
are
more
than
30,000
of
these
idc
hearings
held
each
year
in
the
federal
prison
system,
and
this
court
has
noted
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
maintenance
of
good
order
within
these
institutions
is
central
to
the
accomplishment
of
all
other
correctional
goals.
therefore,
it
is
essential
that
the
disciplinary
process
work
correctly
and
that
these
idc
hearings
reached
the
right
results
in
the
cases
that
are
brought
before
them.
any
extraneous
factor
that
threatens
to
skew
the
results
of
these
hearings
is
therefore
a
very
important
and
serious
problem.
we
believe,
for
reasons
that
we
hope
to
explain,
that
the
threat
that
disciplinary
committee
members
might
be
sued
for
damages
in
their
personal
capacity
on
the
basis
of
their
service
on
these
committees,
to
do
just
that
would
skew
the
results
of
these
hearings
and
therefore
would
weaken
prison
discipline
and
security,
and
for
that
reason
we
have
sought
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
facts
here
can
be
briefly
stated.
in
january
1975
there
was
a
two-day
strike
by
inmates
at
the
terre
haute
prison.
a
few
weeks
later
the
respondents
in
this
case,
saxner
and
cain
who
were
inmates
at
terre
haute,
were
charged
with
encouraging
prisoners
to
engage
in
another
work
stoppage.
these
charges
were
heard
before
prison
idc
on
february
21,
1975.
members
of
the
idc
that
day,
unfortunately
for
them,
were
the
three
petitioners
in
this
case,
cleavinger,
marcadis
and
lockett.
after
hearing
testimony
and
looking
at
the
documentary
evidence,
the
idc
found
respondents
guilty
of
encouraging
this
work
stoppage.
in
addition,
based
on
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
at
the
hearing,
the
idc
found
the
respondents
had
also
committed
another
violation
of
prison
rules,
possession
of
contraband,
on
the
basis
of
certain
materials
advocating
the
formation
of
a
prisoners'
labor
union
that
had
been
found
in
their
cells.
the
discipline
committee
ordered
that
respondents
be
placed
in
administrative
segregation
and
that
they
forfeit
some
of
their
good
time.
saxner
and
cain
appealed
this
decision
to
the
prison
warden,
who
gave
them
virtually
all
of
the
relief
that
they
had
requested.
he
ordered
their
release
from
administrative
segregation,
and
he
ordered
that
the
forfeited
good
time
be
restored
to
them.
the
warder
refused
to
expunge
respondents'
records,
and
so
they
therefore
took
the
next
step
in
the
administrative
appeals
process
by
appealing
to
the
regional
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
who
in
april
1975
gave
them
the
rest
of
the
relief
that
they
had
requested.
he
ordered
that
their
records
be
expunged.
respondents
were
still
not
satisfied,
so
they
brought
this
bivens
action
against
the
three
members
of
their
discipline
committee,
alleging
that
petitioners
and
other
prison
employees
had
violated
their
rights
under
the
first,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
and
eighth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
the
only
charge
that
is
relevant
here
is
the
fifth
amendment
claim
because
the
jury
found
after
trial
that
petitioners
had
violated
respondents'
due
process
rights
at
the
idc
hearing
by
finding
them
guilty
of
a
charge,
the
possession
of
contraband
charge,
of
which
they
had
not
received
24
hours'
advance
notice.
the
jury
awarded
$5,000
for
this
due
process
violation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
jury
found...
there
was
a
special
verdict.
the
jury
found
that
the
respondents
had
been
deprived
of
due
process
because
they
had
not
given
advance
notice
of
the
charge
on
which
they
had
been
convicted,
the
possession
of
contraband
charge.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
under
special
verdict.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
procedural
due
process,
yes.
petitioners
appealed
this
$9,000
verdict
to
the
seventh
circuit,
but
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
quasi-judicial
immunity,
and
they
sought
re-hearing
en
banc
but
that
was
denied
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
petitioners
also
challenged
the
amount
of
damages.
the
seventh
circuit
thought
that
the
amount
was
excessive
but
did
not
set
it
aside
and
did
not
seek
review
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
only
question
we
sought
certiorari
on
is
the
absolute
immunity
question.
i
might
also
add,
although
it's
also
not
here,
that
the
jury
was
incorrectly
instructed
on
qualified
immunity
under
this
court's
subsequent
decision
in
harlow.
now,
the
framework
for
analyzing
the
absolute
immunity
issue
in
this
case
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
framework,
we
think,
for
analyzing
the
absolute
immunity
issue
in
this
case
is
rather
clear
in
light
of
this
court's
prior
decisions.
in
butz
against
economou
the
court
held
that
most
executive
branch
officials
charged
with
constitutional
violations
enjoy
only
a
qualified
immunity
from
damages
liability.
the
court
held
that
there
are
certain
government
officials
whose
special
functions
require
a
full
exemption
from
damages
liability
in
the
public
interest,
and
in
a
number
of
cases
since
butz
the
court
has
wrestled
with
the
question,
whether
this
particular
function
or
that
required
a
full
exemption
from
damages,
liability,
prosecutors
or
witnesses
in
judicial
proceedings,
or
the
president
of
the
united
states.
but
this
case,
we
think,
is
quite
different
from
all
of
these
previous
cases
in
a
rather
fundamental
way,
and
that's
because
this
court
has
already
held
in
cases
stretching
back
more
than
a
century
that
one
function
of
government
that
does
require
a
full
exemption
from
damages
liability
in
the
public
interest
is
the
adjudicatory
function,
and
the
court
has
also
held
in
many
cases
that
even
executive
branch
officials
who
don't
hold
the
rank
or
title
or
judge,
such
as
administrative
hearing
officers,
are
nonetheless
entitled
to
quasi-judicial
immunity
if
what
they're
engaged
in
are
adjudicatory
functions
that
are
comparable
to
that
of
a
judge.
the
test
that
we
think
emerges
from
these
cases,
principally
butz
against
economou,
is
the
following:
a
government
official
is
entitled
to
quasi-judicial
immunity
if,
first,
his
role
is
functionally
comparable
to
that
of
a
judge;
second,
the
controversies
that
he
resolves
are
such
as
to
lead
to
harassing
or
retaliatory
litigation
that
would
chill
the
proper
performance
of
those
adjudicatory
duties;
and
finally,
that
the
adjudicatory
system
contains
other
safeguards
to
avoid
or
correct
constitutional
violations
if
they
should
occur.
we
think
that
if
that
test
is
applied
to
this
case,
the
result
that
follows
inevitably
is
that
executive
officials
whose
job
it
is
to
adjudicate
prison
disciplinary
charges
at
these
hearings
have
to
be
afforded
absolutely
immunity
from
damages
liability
in
suits
brought
by
disgruntled
inmates
if
this
important
governmental
function
is
to
be
performed
properly.
as
to
the
first
factor
announced
in
butz,
the
record,
we
think,
shows
beyond
doubt
that
the
institution
discipline
committee
members
are
engaged
in
the
classic
judicial
function.
they
are
required
to
determine,
based
on
the
evidence
before
them,
whether
a
specific
individual
has
committed
specific
alleged
charges,
and
they
do
that
precisely
the
way
judges
or
administrative
law
judges
would
go
about
doing
the
precise,
same
thing.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
for
imposing
discipline,
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
would
violate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
to
my
knowledge,
certainly
not
the
federal
system.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
not
guards.
i
should
make
that
point
quite
clear.
judge
cudahy
in
his
concurring
opinion
has
this
offhand
reference
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--guards
do
not
sit
on
these
committees.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they're
not
glorified
guards.
they
have
to
be
at
the
level
of
department
head
or
higher.
these
are
high
level
correctional
officials
at
the
prison.
they're
not
guards.
they're
not
people
who
have
day
to
day
contact
with
the
prisoners,
and
this
is
done
to
assure
to
the
extent
possible,
impartiality,
and
people
of
stature
who
won't
be
influenced.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
are
part
of
the
correctional
staff.
it's
not
the
warden
himself.
the
warden
keeps
aloof
from
these
proceedings
because
he
has
to
hear
appeals
from
them.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
suggesting
you
are,
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
if
what
the
guard
was
doing
is
what
these
idc
members
do,
that
the
immunity
would
attach
just
the
same,
but
that
would
relate
more
to
the
final
part
of
the
butz
test,
i
think,
which
is
whether
the
system
is
procedurally
fair,
and
when
i
get
to
that
i
will
explain
that
one
of
the
facts
of
this
system
that
makes
it
procedurally
fair
is
that
the
members
of
this
discipline
committee
are
high-level
officials
of
the
prison
who
do
not
have
day
to
day
contact
with
the
inmates.
although
i
think
it
would
be
procedurally
fair
even
to
appoint
the
guard,
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
that's
not
what
is
done
in
the
federal
prisons.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
categorically.
we'd
have
to
know
what
the
features
are
of
each
of
these
state
systems
to
see
how
these
disciplinary
committees
are
composed.
i
would
say
in
general,
since
all
of
these
systems
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
wolff
against
mcdonald,
and
in
all
of
these
systems
there
is
the
same
fear
of
retaliatory
litigation,
i
would
think
the
answer
would
be
yes,
but
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
what
the
rules
are
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
courts
in
the
immunity
cases
have
never
distinguished
between
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
have
decided
this
particular
issue
have
not
really
drawn
distinctions.
but
we
want
to
focus
here
on
the
federal
system.
that
is
our
prime
concern,
and
we
think
it
would
have
a
drastic
effect
on
the
operation
of
the
federal
disciplinary
system
because
of
the
way
it's
structured
to
have
the
threat
of
damages
liability
hanging
over
the
heads
of
these
decision
makers.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
make
the
same...
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
but
that's
not
the
case
in
the
federal
system,
and
of
course
whatever
system
the
state
set
up
would
have
to
satisfy
the
due
process
clause
as
construed
in
cases
like
wolff.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
it,
but
i
think
i
have
information
that
would
answer
your
question.
it's
not
a
very
large
percentage
of
their
time.
i
have
statistics
that
were
compiled
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
a
year
ago.
i
think
they're
accurate.
at
terre
haute,
for
example,
this
committee
sits
3.5
hours
a
day,
three
days
a
week,
and
there
are
29
members
of
the
staff
of
several
hundred
who
are
eligible
to
sit
on
this
committee.
i
don't
think
they
spend
a
large
percentage
of
their--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
well,
they're
different
in
that
sense,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
many
ways
that
makes
them
more
subject
to
the
threat
of
harassing
or
intimidating
litigation
because
this
is
not
their
full-time
job
and
perhaps
they
don't
have
the
same
professional
commitment
to
judging
that
an
administrative
law
judge--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
it's
full-time
when
they're
doing
it,
but
it's
obviously
not
full-time
for
them
in
terms
of
their
occupation.
but
when
they're
out
doing
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
he
would,
and
we
think
the
same
should
apply
here.
just
what
these
judges
do,
what
these
disciplinary
committee
members
do,
is
precisely
the
same
as
what
a
judge
does.
he
listens
to
the
evidence.
he
has
to
resolve
credibility
disputes.
he
has
to
make
rulings
on
whether
evidence
should
be
admissible.
it
might
not
be
admissible
because
it's
irrelevant
or
redundant
or
some
other
reason,
and
they
have
to
justify
their
conclusions
like
the
judge
does
by
having
written
findings
explaining
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
precisely
why
they
have
reached
the
decision
that
they
have.
we
believe
this
is
the
essence
of
the
adjudicatory
function,
and
we
really
don't
believe
respondent's
brief
is
taking
serious
issue
with
that
proposition.
what
idc
members
do,
therefore,
is
functionally
comparable
to
that
of
a
judge.
we
think
that
it's
equally
obvious
that
the
proper
functioning
of
this
adjudicatory
system
would
be
seriously
impaired
if
the
people
who
sat
on
these
committees
were
fair
game
for
litigants
who
were
unhappy
with
their
decisions.
in
pradley
versus
fisher,
and
more
recently
in
cases
like
person
versus
ray
and
stump
versus
sparkman,
the
court
has
upheld
the
principle
of
absolute
judicial
immunity
by
emphasizing
that
judges
would
be
intimidated
and
the
whole
judicial
process
would
suffer
if
they
could
be
sued
personally
on
the
basis
of
their
rulings.
the
court
in
butz
against
economou
made
the
same
exact
point
in
the
context
of
administrative
law
judges,
pointing
out
the
fractious
nature
of
much
administrative
litigation
these
days.
well,
if
these
statements
are
true,
and
we
believe
they
obviously
are,
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
context
in
which
there
is
more
likelihood
of
harassing
or
intimidating
litigation
than
this
one.
we
would
think
that
the
principle
the
court
announced
in
these
cases
is
really
at
its
zenith
in
a
case
like
this,
and
we
think
that's
true
both
by
focusing
on
the
identity
of
the
putative
plaintiffs
in
these
bivens
cases,
by
focusing
on
the
identity
of
the
putative
defendants
in
these
bivens
cases.
as
to
the
plaintiffs,
as
this
court
noted
in
wolff
against
mcdonald,
prison
disciplinary
hearings
take
place
against
a
background
of
resentment
and
hostility
on
the
part
of
many
inmates
towards
prison
authorities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
there
are.
in
1983
the
bureau
came
out
with
detailed
regulations
providing
who
can
serve
on
these
committees,
not
at
the
time,
i
believe,
of...
actually,
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
which
was
1975,
there
were
regulations
that
require
that
at
least
two
of
the
three
members
of
the
committee
be
a
department
head
or
higher.
there
was
also
a
requirement,
which
is
still
in
the
regulations,
that
no
one
could
serve
on
these
committees
who
was
involved
in
the
charging
decision
or
in
the
investigational
decision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
is,
as
i
was
about
to
say,
not
in
the
last
few
years.
the
department...
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
instituted
an
extensive
program
of
certification
and
periodic
testing,
and
no
one
can
serve
on
these
committees
unless
they
satisfy
those
testing
and
certification
requirements.
but
at
all
times
since
1975
and
afterwards,
no
one
can
serve
on
these
committees
unless
they
had
a
certain
stature
within
the
bureau
of
prisons,
unless
they
were
impartial
in
the
sense
that
they
were
not
at
all
involved
in
the
charging
or
the
investigation
of
the
particular
case
that
was
before
the
itc.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
justice
marshall,
again
a
guard
does
not
sit
on
these
committees,
but
if
a
guard
did
wish
to
take
the
test
there
is
an
extensive
program
of
testing,
learning
the
rules
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--to
become
a
prison
guard?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
aware
of
what
the
educational
requirements
for
guard
are,
justice
marshall.
i
am
aware
of
what
they
are
for
people
who
would
like
to
sit
on
these.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
a
prison
employee
wishes
to
sit
on
an
idc,
he
has
to
go
through
a
periodic
testing
program
and
certification,
has
to
pass
a
written
test,
has
to
learn
the
rules
of
this
court
in
cases
like
wolff
against
mcdonald,
and
he
has
to
learn
the
regulations
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
promulgated
for
the
operation
of
these
idc's.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
marshall,
you
are
talking
about
how
much
formal
education
they
have
to
have
in
terms
of
high
school
or
college.
i'm
not
certain
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
as
far
as
i
know
there
isn't
any,
except
for
whatever
educational
requirements
there
are
to
become
an
employee
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
know
of
any
formal
educational
requirements.
i
do
know
that
there
are
extensive
educational
requirements
to
sit
on
an
idc.
there
are,
as
far
as
i
know,
no
educational
requirements
in
terms
of
high
school
education
to
become
an
article
3
judge.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
a
supreme
court
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
actually,
by
statute,
the
solicitor
general
must
be
learned
in
the
law,
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
his
assistants,
that's
true,
or
his
deputies,
although
they
all
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
congress,
i
think
so.
in
any
event,
unlike
in
a
normal
adjudicatory
process
where
i
think
a
litigant
really
has
no
reason
to
expect
that
he
lost
before
a
judge
because
the
judge
was
hostile
to
him
personally,
the
unfortunate
reality
is
that
in
the
prison
disciplinary
proceedings
many
inmates
do
feel
that
they
lost
solely
because
the
board
was
hostile
to
them,
or
was
biased
or
committed
some
act
of
misconduct,
and
we
think
that
the
inmates
who
lose
at
these
idc
hearings
would
therefore
often
like
to
strike
back
in
some
way.
now,
the
court
said,
in
wolff
against
mcdonald,
and
i
quote,
it
said,
"retaliation"...
they
are
talking
about
retaliation
by
prisoners
resentful
of
disciplinary
hearings.
the
court
said,
"retaliation
is
much
more
than
a
theoretical
possibility.
"
if
that's
so,
and
we
believe
it
certainly
is,
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
this
retaliation
would
take
the
form
of
damage
actions
if
they
are
available.
i
think
the
urge
to
strike
back
by
filing
bivens-type
actions
would
often
prove
irresistible
and
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
prisoners
as
a
group
are
somewhat
prodigious
and
indiscriminate
litigators.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
like
alj's,
or--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
the
solution
that
the
respondents
offer.
i
think
that
our
case
in
many
ways
would
be
stronger
in
terms
of
absolute
immunity.
our
case,
i
think,
would
be
much
weaker
in
terms
of
what
impact
that
would
have
on
prison
discipline
and
security
because
this
court
in
the
cases
like
wolff
against
mcdonald
has
refused
to
require
those
sorts
of
procedures,
simply
because
it
would
jeopardize
prison
discipline
and
security.
i
hope
to
discuss
that
if
i
have
time
when
i
talk
about
the
third
butz
test
which
is
the
procedural
protections
that
are
available
in
a
particular
adjudicatory
system
under
attack.
so,
we
think
that
the
factors
that
deter
the
filing
of
insubstantial
lawsuits
really
don't
have
the
same
effect
on
prisoners
as
they
do
on
other
potential
litigants,
and
there's
a
real
fear,
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
asked...
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
obviously,
but
i
asked
the
bureau
of
prisons
recently
and
they
told
me
there
are
approximately
75
pending
bivens
suits
by
prisoners.
i
should
add,
and
that
may
seem
like
an
insubstantial
number,
it
doesn't
seem
that
way
to
me,
but
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
if
this
court
were
to
affirm...
i
mean,
right
now
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
whether
these
sorts
of
suits
can
proceed.
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
has
held
that
disciplinary
committee
members
have
absolute
immunity.
a
number
of
district
courts
have
held
that.
i
think
if
this
court
were
to
affirm,
we
would
see
a
drastic
rise
in
that.
but
let
me
also
say,
justice
stevens,
that
our
principal
concern
here
is
not
necessarily
that
the
courts
will
be
flooded
by
bivens
suits.
we
are
more
concerned
by
the
fact
that
if
this
court
affirms,
and
the
potential
is
there
for
bivens
suits
for
personal
damages
liability,
that
the
people
who
sit
on
these
committees
will
take
that
into
account
when
they're
making
their
decisions
on
whether
somebody
has
committed
a
particular
offense.
that's
what
we're
concerned
about.
it's
the
extraneous
influence
on
the
adjudicatory
process,
and
not
necessarily
the
fact
that
there
will
be
several
hundred
bivens
suits
filed,
although
i
think
we
can
expect
there
will
be.
now,
finally,
let
me
get
to
the
third
factor
mentioned
in
butz.
we
believe
that
the
procedures
at
these
idc
hearings
provide
sufficient
safeguards
for
the
protection
of
constitutional
rights
by
the
inmates
without
the
need
for
bivens
actions.
needless
to
say,
the
disciplinary
hearings
in
the
federal
system
fully
meet
and
in
many
respects
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
as
construed
in
cases
like
wolff
and
ponte
versus
real.
people
who
sit
on
these
committees,
as
i
said
earlier,
have
to
be
impartial.
an
inmate
is
entitled
to
notice
of
the
charges
against
him,
he
is
entitled
to
call
witnesses,
to
give
documentary
evidence.
the
inmate
is
entitled
to
give
his
side
of
the
story,
generally
entitled
to
be
present
throughout
the
proceedings
except
during
the
deliberations
of
the
committee,
and
most
importantly,
the
idc
has
to
keep
a
complete
record
of
its
proceedings
and
has
to
justify
both
the
liability
decision
it
makes,
whether
the
prisoner
is
guilty
or
innocent,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence.
it
also
has
to
justify
what
sanction
it
has
decided
to
impose
if
it
finds
that
the
prisoner
committed
the
violation,
and
also
three
levels
of
administrative
review
within
the
prison
system,
plus
the
opportunity
of
judicial
review.
there
is
an
appeal
first
to
the
warden,
then
to
the
regional
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
finally
general
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
who
personally
reviews
each
of
these
matters
in
order
to
try
to
achieve
some
consistency.
and
this
very
case,
i
think,
shows
that
this
is
a
meaningful
remedy
because
the
respondents
in
this
case
appealed
to
the
warden
and
then
appealed
to
the
regional
director,
and
within
six
weeks
had
gotten
all
of
the
relief
that
they
had
ever
asked
for.
i
should
add
as
a
footnote
to
all
of
this
that
another
perverse
effect
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
there's
nothing,
obviously,
that...
even
the
judge
who
sends
someone
to
jail
pending
charges--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
agree,
but
i
think
the
same
thing
could
be
said
for
many
judicial-type
decisions.
the
actual
sanctions
that
were
imposed
were
set
aside
as
quickly
as
they
could
have
been
set
aside
when
they
were
brought
to
the
next
level
of
review.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
understand,
justice.
and
there
can't
be
delay
in
this
system
because
the
regulations
provide
there
must
be
a
decision
within,
i
believe--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
there
should
be
no
bivens
remedy.
there
is
appeal
to
the
next
higher
level,
and
there
is
appeal
to
the
courts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
he
wasn't
in
solitary.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
a
possibility,
but
it's
a
possibility
with
judicial
proceedings
as
well.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
terms
of
the
actual
sanctions
imposed,
it's
not
as
if
there
is
no
way
short
of
a
bivens
remedy
of
getting
people
to
be
appreciative
of
constitutional
rights,
because
there
is
an
administrative
remedy
which
i
am
told
leads
to
reversals
in
<twenty>
[=
20]
percent
of
the
cases,
and
there
is
full
opportunity
for
judicial
review
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
but
the
harm
may
have
been
very,
very
minor.
it
may
not
have
involved--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
justice,
in
this
case
for
example,
if
there
had
been
no
segregation
order
but
simply
the
forfeiture
of
good
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
six
weeks
later
the
good
time
had
been
restored,
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
damage.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
the
more
serious
ones,
but
many
of
these
idc
hearings
don't
involve
such
serious
charges.
now,
let
me
just
say,
the
respondents
object
to
the
adequacy
of
these
procedures.
in
fact,
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
don't
take
much
issue
with
our
analysis
of
the
first
and
second
butz
criteria.
they
make
no
real
effort
to
suggest
that
what
the
petitioners
were
doing
here
was
not
comparable
to
a
judge,
and
they
certainly
make
no
effort
to
rebut
our
suggestion
that
there
would
be
grave
potential
for
retaliatory
litigation
here.
they
put
all
of
their
eggs,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
third
basket
of
butz
by
claiming
that
the
procedures
were
not
adequate,
and
what
they
suggest
is
that
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
wants
absolute
immunity
for
its
hearing
officers,
what
they
should
do
is
incorporate
into
the
disciplinary
system
precisely
those
trial-type
features
that
exist
in
court,
or
that
exist
in
administrative
proceedings.
but
i
think
this
shows
the
fatal
flaw
in
respondent's
argument,
because
this
court,
in
wolff
against
mcdonald,
said
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
those
sorts
of
proceedings,
and
the
court
didn't
say
that
in
an
offhand
or
cavalier
manner.
what
the
court
did
was
carefully
balance
the
private
rights
involved
versus
the
public
interest
in
maintaining
prison
security
and
discipline.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand
that.
i
understand,
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
in
order
to
gain
absolute
immunity
for
these
decision
makers
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
have
to
incorporate
all
these
trial-type
procedures
at
the
very
same
time
that
the
prison
discipline
and
security
that
we
are
concerned
about
in
asking
for
absolute
immunity
would
occur,
because
if
this
court
refused
to
require
those
procedures
in
wolff
against
mcdonald,
basically
because
they
would
jeopardize
prison
security.
the
court
said
that
to
require
cross
examination,
or
lawyers
present,
or
the
right
of
confrontation,
would
undermine
correctional
goals,
would
jeopardize
prison
security,
would
heighten
tensions
in
the
institution.
these
are
the
very
sorts
of
things
that
the
respondents
claim
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
to
risk
in
order
to
get
absolute
immunity
for
its
decision
makers.
so,
it's
sort
of
a
catch-22,
in
order
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--perhaps,
justice
o'connor,
although
i
think
there
is
a
degree
of
impartiality
and
the
due
process
clause
obviously
doesn't
require
any
more,
this
court
held
in
wolff
against
mcdonald.
but
beyond
that,
i
mean,
there
are
30,000
or
35,000
or
these
hearings
every
year.
you
would
need
a
corps
larger
than
the
corps
that
handles
disability
cases,
i
would
think.
and
you
know,
it
is
common
knowledge,
i
think
among
correctional
officials,
that
for
discipline
to
have
any
effect
it
has
to...
there
has
to
be
a
quick
hearing
and
a
prompt
determination.
if
you...
if
we
need
a
corps
of
roving
administrative
law
judges,
it
may
be
a
long
period
of
time
before
these
hearings
could
be
held.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they're
not
wholly,
and
obviously
what
the
court
has
done
in
the
area
of
qualified
immunity
is
useful,
but
it's
not
at
all
a
complete
answer
because
all
qualified
immunity
really
does
is
prevent
an
adverse
judgment
from
being
entered
against
the
defendant,
perhaps.
it
doesn't
prevent
the
defendant
from
being
sued.
it
doesn't
prevent
the
defendant
from
perhaps
having
to
go
through
many
months
of
litigation,
the
burden
and
expense
of
having
to
defend
against
litigation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
because
an
error
was
made.
i
mean,
i
see
many
of
these
cases,
justice
white,
and
i
think
the
court
would
be
surprised
at
how
often,
despite
harlow,
district
judges
refuse
to
dismiss
these
cases
quickly,
either
by
finding
that
there
are
disputed
issues
of
material
fact
or
whatever.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
a
case
by
case
determination
is
made
by
the
justice
department.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
justice
department
was
representing
these
people,
but
they
had
no
right
to
representation
and
of
course
the
justice
department
or
the
government
does
not
pay
any
final
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
these
cases
the
justice
department
generally
represents
the
defendant.
