justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
if
i
understand
you,
the
immunity
would
attach
even
if
the
warden
decided
to
assign
a
guard
to
hear
one
of
these
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
i
understand.
this
of
course
is
a
federal
case
and
it's
a
bivens-type
action
rather
than
1983
action.
lots
of
our
cases
sort
of
don't
draw
a
fine
distinction
between
the
federal
and
state
procedures.
do
you
think
the
decision
of
this
case
will
also
apply
to
state
systems
in
1983
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
in
your
brief
you
rely
on
both
1983
cases
and
federal
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
reason
i
asked,
of
course,
is
as
justice
marshall
suggests,
supposing
a
state
system
as
a
routine
matter
used
guards
at
the
trial
level
but
had
an
appellate
review
system,
you
would
still
say
the
immunity--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
you
mentioned
that
there
are
some
30,000
of
these
hearings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
federal
system
every
year.
are
there
any
statistics
on
how
often
the
members
of
the
disciplinary
commission
have
actually
been
sued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
how
can
you
say
they
got
all
the
relief
they
asked
for?
didn't
they
spend
some
time
in
solitary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
isn't
that
the
risk
that
this
remedy
is
supposed
to
take
care
of?
let's
say
you
had
an
arbitrary
board
that
stuck
somebody
away
for
three
weeks,
knowing
it
would
be
reversed
later,
they
would
just
be...
well,
that's
too
bad,
you
got
out
after
three
weeks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
the
appellate
tribunal
felt
the
same
way,
let's
just
keep
them
there
another
couple
of
weeks
and
then...
what
if
they
just
delayed?
i'm
not
suggesting
it
happened,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you're
saying,
even
if
the
regulation
is
violated
there
should
be
no
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
meantime
he
sits
in
solitary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
that's
the
possibility,
and
you
can't
come
in...
i
really
don't
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
then,
20
percent
of
the
cases,
somebody
has
suffered
some
temporary
harm
for
which
there
will
be
no
recourse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
minor
to
us
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
segregation
a
typical
remedy
in
discipline
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
government
pay
the
cost
of
defense?
who
defends
the
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
who--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
i
understand
that.
