justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
jury
itself
make
the
determination
that
due
process
had
been
denied
because
of
finding
their
guilt
on
the
charge
that
hadn't
been
made,
or
was
that
determination
made
by
the
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
was
a
jury
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
geller,
does
the
record
show
what
portion
of
their
work
time
these
particular
petitioners
spend
in
sitting
on
the
idc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
that
extent
they
are
somewhat
different
than
administrative
law
judges
who
presumably
spend
just
about
all
their
time
adjudicating?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
respondents'
contention
isn't
that
due
process
requires
it,
but
that
if
you're
going
to
give
absolute
immunity--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
gets
the
impression
from
judge
woods'
opinion
that
perhaps
even
the
seventh
circuit
may
be
lined
up
to
reconsider
the
whole
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
five
to
four?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
you
can
be
neutral
and
detached
if
you've
only
been
to--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
are
two
separate
things.
if
there's
an
educational
requirement
as
you
suggest,
that's
one
thing,
but
neutral
and
detached,
to
suggest
that
the
more
educated
you
are
the
more
neutral
you
get,
certainly
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
the
government's
point
to
be
not
so
much
the
flood
of
litigation,
but
the
impact
on
the
decision
making
process
in
the
prison,
that
the
close
calls
would
go
for
the
inmate
because
of
fear
of
suit.
