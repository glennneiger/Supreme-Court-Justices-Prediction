mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
government
comes
to
this
court
today
to
ask
is
a
radical
extension
of
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
the
case
of
butz
versus
economou,
and
further
asks
this
court
to
ignore
its
decision
in
wood
versus
strickland
and
to
afford
them
an
exceptional
form
of
absolute
immunity
which
has
heretofore
been
reserved
by
this
court
only
to
judges
and
to
administrative
law
judges.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
we
don't
have
any
disagreement
with
that.
in
imbler--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
applied
very
clearly
through
the
butz
test.
you
have
to
look
at
the
function.
that's
the
beginning
of
it.
you
look
at
the
function
in
light
of
the
independence
of
the
decision
maker,
in
light
of
the
procedural
safeguards.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
that's
right,
he--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--that's
true,
but
he...
if
you
compare
him
to
these
supposed
senior
administrators
that
made
the
decisions
in
this
case,
the
1975,
you
find
the
differences
are
paramount.
you
find
that
he's
a
lawyer.
you
find
that
he
has
seven
years
of
experience.
he's
required
to
have
seven
years
of
litigation
experience
in
hearing
decisions.
he
can't
perform
any
other
functions.
the
only
function
that
he
can
perform
is
being
a
hearing
officer.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
well,
you
mean
like
a
magistrate,
that
kind
of
thing?
i'd
have
to
look
at
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
i
think
that
they
by
and
large
are
independent.
they're
a
third
force,
an
adjudicatory
force.
they're
not
drawn
from
one
side
or
another
like
it
is
in
a
prison.
in
a
prison,
the
prisoners
are
being
judged
in
these
hearings
by
their
adversaries,
that
is,
the
prison
guards
or
the
prison
administrators
themselves.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
it.
if
you
read
in
the
appendix
the
supposed
record
of
the
hearing,
you
see
page
after
page
of
these
administrators,
one
of
whom
was
an
operational
lieutenant
who
after
mr.
saxner
was
placed
in
segregation
was
in
charge
of
his
day
to
day
custody,
asking
him
question
after
question
designed
to
elicit
unfavorable
information.
it
was
like
an
inquisitorial
process,
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
he
had
no
counsel.
he
had
no
right
to
compel
witnesses.
he
had
no
right
to
cross
examine.
in
fact,
he
was
convicted
on
double
hearsay
that
was
unattributed.
that
was
it.
that
was
the
sum
total
of
it.
it
says
a
one-line
thing,
what
is
the
evidence
they
relied
on?
it
was
double
hearsay
not
attributed
to
a
name,
but
someone
said
he
was
about
the
institution
talking
with
people
and
encouraging
the
work
stoppage.
that
was
the
sum
total
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
convicted
on.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
well,
we
are
bound
by
the
dictates
in
butz
versus
economou
and
wood
versus
strickland.
i'm
not
here
on
a
clean
slate.
i'm
here
arguing
the
principles
of
judicial
immunity.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
prosecutors
get
their
immunity
from
another
branch
of
the
quasi-judicial
doctrine,
and
that
is
because
they
are
integrally
involved
in
the
judicial
process.
a
prosecutor
has
all
the
safeguards
of
that
open
judicial
process.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
they're
adversaries,
that's
true,
but
they
got
their
immunity
not
because
of
their
adversarial
position
but
their
position
in
a
judicial
process
that's
supervised
by
a
judge.
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
a
guard...
it
depends
on
the
factual
situation,
but
a
guard
will
bring
an
incident
report,
which
will
then
be
served
on
the
prisoner,
who
will
then
come
to
the
hearing
after
getting
notice,
although
that
was
one
of
the
major
problems
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
guard
was
sued,
yes,
the
charging
guard
was
also
sued.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
he's
not.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
he
was
acquitted
by
the
jury.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
in
terms
of
absolute
immunity,
no,
no.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--qualified
immunity?
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
there
was...
that
wasn't
the
finding
of
the
jury.
i
don't
think
they
made
a
specific
finding
that
he
had
qualified
immunity.
i
think
they
found
on
the
facts
that
he
wasn't
involved
in
the
due
process
violation
or
the
retaliatory
action
which
spawned
the
basis
of
the
placement
in
segregation.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
warden
was
sued
also,
and
he
was
also
acquitted
by
the
jury.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
no.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
immunity.
it
was
a
factual
determination,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
there
was
none
made.
the
only
argument
for
absolute
immunity
that
was
made
by
defendants
was
pre-trial
for
these
idc
members.
and
another
aspect
of
the
proceeding,
your
honor,
is
that
you
asked
about
the
prosecutor
and
you
asked
about,
isn't
there
a
charging
guard.
well,
the
idc
does
the
questioning
in
the
proceeding,
so
it
acts
as
a
prosecutor
and
then
it
adjudicates,
and
it
adjudicates
on
bases
other
than
just
the
evidence.
it
adjudicates
on
behavior,
background;
it
adjudicates
on
what
it
knows
about
the
individual.
and
i
have
to
take
strong
exception
to
the
government's
position
that
because
these
are
senior...
or
some
of
them
are
now
senior
officials
in
the
institution,
that
that
means
they
are
more
impartial.
they
worked
their
way
up
through
the
system.
these
were
all
guards
that
have
been
promoted,
and
in
fact
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
marcadis,
one
of
the
three
members,
was
still
an
operational
lieutenant
who
had
day
to
day
custodial
responsibilities
for
mr.
saxner.
so,
i
think
that's
somewhat
of
a
distinction,
without
a
difference,
in
a
prison
context.
the
adversarial...
as
you
get
closer
to
the
warden,
that
that
whole
kind
of
influence
and
pressure
which
butz
talks
about
that
is
so
absent
from
an
alj,
there's
no
agency
pressure,
whereas
here
the
pressure
of
the
warden,
the
pressure
of
the
situation
of
the
fellow
guards
and
the
fellow
administrators
all
of
whom
are
in
an
adversarial,
keeper-kept
relationship
with
the
prison
guards
is
paramount,
and
that
goes
to
that
important
question
about
independence.
i
am
flabbergasted
that
the
government
would
think
that
we
don't
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
these
people
are
independent.
we
certainly
say,
and
we
argue,
one
of
the
strongest
points
in
our
brief
is
the
lack
of
independence.
if
you
look
at
bradley
versus
fisher,
if
you
look
at
stump
versus
sparkman
and
pierson
versus
ray,
you
see
in
all
those
cases,
again
and
again
they
are
talking
about
the
independence
of
the
judiciary,
the
importance
of
preserving
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
there's
no
independence
here
to
preserve.
that
is
the
first
part
of
the
butz
test.
another
part
of
the
butz
test
to
determine
whether
you
get
absolute
immunity,
and
which
they
use
to
determine
alj's,
administrative
law
judges
did,
is
the
reliability
of
the
information
before
the
body.
in
an
alj
hearing,
in
an
administrative
law
hearing,
you
can't
convict
somebody
entirely
on
hearsay.
it's
subject
to
cross
examination.
there
are
lawyers
there.
you
have
the
right
to
compel.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
well,
that's
true,
but
he
makes
a
recommendation
based
on
a
plenary
hearing
and
that
recommendation
then
goes
to
the
agency
and
then
that
is
either
affirmed
or
denied
or
whatever.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
that's
true,
and
there's
an
absolute
right
to
judicial
review,
which
of
course
there
isn't
here
either.
here
you
have
to
make
a
constitutional
claim
and
it's
a
discretionary
proceeding
whether
you
get
into
court
or
not.
so,
that's
another
important
butz
factor
which
is
absent
here,
appellate
review,
the
importance
of
review,
and
finally,
the
procedural
safeguards.
counsel
seems
to
be
trying
to
say
that
because
you
get
minimum
due
process
in
these
hearings,
that
that
equates
with
the
procedural
safeguards,
making
you
functionally
comparable
to
a
judge.
i
think
this
court
has
again
and
again
and
again
dealt
with
due
process
cases,
starting
with...
well,
before
this
but
germane
to
my
argument,
starting
with
goldberg
versus
kelly,
morrissey
versus
brewer,
gagnon
versus
scarpelli,
and
then
wolff
and
various...
baxter
and
other
various
prison
disciplinary
cases.
and
again
and
again,
i
can
quote
you
language
from
each
of
those
cases
where
you
looked
at
disciplinary...
not
hearings,
due
process
hearings
which
had
by
and
large
more
safeguards.
the
welfare
deprivation
hearing
in
goldberg
had
the
cross
examination
confrontation,
the
same
with
parole
revocation
hearings
and
probation
revocation
hearings.
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
looked
at
those
hearings
and
characterized
them
as
informal
proceedings,
as
non-adversarial
proceedings,
and
just
recently
in
the
walpole
case
out
of
massachusetts,
this
court
looked
at
a
disciplinary
hearing,
and
justice
o'connor,
speaking
for
the
court,
characterized
that
disciplinary
hearing
in
a
prison
context
was
a
"non-judicial
proceeding".
so,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
if
we
talk
we
can
use
the
word
"functionally
comparable",
but
when
we're
talking
about
"functionally
comparable"
it
means
what
it
says.
we
have
to
look
at
what
a
judge
does
and
see
if
what
a
judge
does
and
what
the
protections
that
a
judge
operates
under,
and
the
independence
that
a
judge
or
an
alj
brings
to
a
situation
exists
or--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
been
decided
by
either
this
court.
probation
officers,
i
would
assume,
would
get
qualified
immunity,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
been
decided.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
parole
officers,
there
are
some
circuit
cases,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
and
one
other
circuit,
who
have
decided...
have
afforded
them
absolute
immunity,
the
other
circuit
being
the
seventh
circuit,
i
believe.
but
the
distinctions
between
parole
officers,
parole
boards
and
hearing
officers,
prison
guards
and
prison
officials
in
a
prison
context
are
quite
paramount,
and
that
is
that
a
parole
board
doesn't
come
from
the
prison.
it's
judging
prisoners,
but
it
is
not
chosen
from
the
prison.
in
illinois
the
governor
chooses
them.
he
has
to
have
specific
background
in
education.
he's
approved
by
the
senate
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
i
can't
speak
in
general
as
the
government
has.
i
can
only
point
you
to
our
record,
and
i
think
that
in
my
experience,
having
litigated
in
various
federal
prisons
over
the
last
ten
or
15
years,
it
seems
that
in
all
the
cases...
and
also
in
state
prisons
as
well,
that
this
is...
they
come
right
from
the
prison.
these
men
that
judged
my
clients
here
were
long-time
prison
guards.
you
can
tell
subjectivity
right
in
the
record.
when
i
put
mr.
cleavinger
on
the
stand
and
tried
to
get
into
his
thought
processes
in
putting
my
client
in
segregation
and
finding
him
guilty
of
a
nonexistent
charge,
he
said
my
client
is
talking
against
the
institution
and
that
is
wrong.
that
was
what
he
conceived
of.
that
was
his
subjectivity.
the
kinds
of
evidence
in
the
record
here
is
astonishing,
if
you're
looking
at
them
as
judges.
if
you're
looking
at
them
as
adversarial
prison
guards,
then
that's
a
different
matter.
but
if
you're
looking
at
them
as
judges
or
administrative
law
judges,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
reality
of
where
they're
coming
from,
what
their
attitudes
are,
what
kind
of
relationships
they're
in
with
these
prisoners.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
the
remedy
is
so
important.
it's
barely
cavalier
to
say,
well,
in
this
case...
this
case
happens
to
be
the
exception,
i
think,
that
proves
the
rule.
mr.
saxner,
i
think
who
was
a
jailhouse
lawyer,
who
was
in
contact
with
the
aclu,
with
judges,
with
congressmen,
and
who
in
fact...
the
reason
that
he
was
put
in
segregation
when
all
is
known
is
because
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
prison
hospital
and
he
was
going
out
and
interviewing
prisoners
about
the
abhorrent
conditions
in
that
prison
hospital.
unfortunately,
three
other
prisoners
died
in
that
hospital
after
this
case,
and
the
fourth
death
came
to
this
court
in
the
green
versus
carlson
case.
he
was
put
into
segregation
for
that
activity,
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
cases
that
it's
so
important
to
have
a
remedy,
that
there
is
no
remedy
in
that
circumstance
but
damages.
as
was
said
in
bivens,
it's
damages
or
nothing
in
that
kind
of
situation.
he
can
be
let
out
of
segregation,
30
days,
60
days,
90
days
later,
but
he
has
no
remedy
and
there
is
no
deterrent
then.
there
is
no
satisfactory
deterrent
on
that
kind
of
conduct,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
brought
some
statistics
that
are
the
evidence
of
record,
but
it
seems
to
support
our
position
in
the
sense
that
75
bivens
cases,
he
says,
are
pending
and
i
didn't
understand
whether
that
was
75
bivens
cases
against
federal
prison
guards
in
general
or
just
in
the
disciplinary
due
process
area
against
hearing
officers,
but
i
am
assuming
the
latter.
you
look
at
that
in
light
of
the
40,000
adjudicatory
cases
or
whatever
that
he
says
that
they
deal
with
per
year,
and
i
think
that...
and
i
know
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit,
the
first
circuit
and
the
second
circuit,
you
have
been
able
to
sue
idc
members
for
at
least
ten
or
15
years.
i
know
justice
stevens
sat
on
the
chapman
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
early
'70s
which
allowed
that
kind
of
suit.
i
can
cite
the
names
of
cases
in
other
circuits
as
well,
so
it
isn't
like
there's
a
new
thing
that's
going
to
happen
now.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
well,
he
has
what
judge
cudahy
characterized
as
an
ambiguous
footnote,
that
at
some
time
we
ought
to
reconsider
this,
perhaps.
and
i
have
no
more
guidance
than
the
footnote,
as
you
have,
as
to
what
that
indeed
means.
the
seventh
circuit
hasn't
reconsidered
it.
it
voted
down
a
rehearing
on
that
issue.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
right,
right,
and
i
think
that
there's
no
justification
for
the
radical
extension
and
unwarranted
extension
of
butz
that
we
would
be
dealing
with
here.
if
we
look
at
wood
versus
strickland,
this
court
at
that
time
as
it
was
developing
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
was
looking
at
a
very
similar
situation.
it
was
dealing
with
school
board
members
who
as
one
of
their
functions
adjudicated,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
disciplinary
cases
against
students,
and
there
were
due
process
that
was
similar
to
the
kind
of
due
process
that
we
have
in
a
prison
situation.
that
is,
counsel
could
appear.
there
was
some
kind
of
notice.
there
was
some
kind
of
information
given
as
to
what
the
charges
and
the
evidence
was.
but,
it
was
informal
in
the
way
that
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing
is
informal.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
to
me,
in
terms
of
money
or--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--i
think
there
would
be--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--that's
true,
and--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i
only
do
it...
i
only
bring
those
cases
to
trial
when
i
think
i
can
do
it,
and
i've
had
100
percent
success
on
the
cases
i've
done.
i
don't
hold
100
cases
in
my
pocket,
but
in
the
very
severe
cases,
which
is
the
ones
that
i
bring
to
court
where
a
jailhouse
lawyer,
for
instance,
the
only
woman
jailhouse
lawyer
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
put
into
segregation
for
two
years
for
possession
of
a
camera,
and
they
used
an
elastic
contraband
regulation
to
do
that.
well,
the
jury
in
peoria,
illinois
brought
her
back
a
large
judgment
over
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
that
this
court
hasn't
decided
it.
if
i
were
to
personally
be
asked
whether
i
thought
the
court
should
extend
absolute
immunity
to
parole
officers,
i
would
probably
say
no,
but
i
think
that
that...
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
here
because
the
parole
board
is
an
independent
body
that
is
selected
from
the
populace
at
large
and
has
checks
and
balances
on
it.
it
is
approved
by
the
senate.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
they
are
required
to
either
be
law
trained,
medically
trained,
they
take
psychologically
trained.
they're
taken
from...
they
have
some
kind
of
college
background,
and
taken
from
various
areas
because
as
you
have
noted
in
the
greenholtz
case,
the
parole
decision
is
predictive
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
you
need
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
information
and
experience
to
be
brought
to
make
that
kind
of
predictive
decision.
i
think
also
in
the
parole
hearing
context,
you
do
have
the
right
to
a
lawyer,
so
the
safeguards
are...
i
think
that
the
important
safeguards,
probably
the
two
most
important
safeguards
here,
other
than
of
course
the
independence
of
the
decision
maker
him
or
herself,
is
the
right
to
cross
examine
and
confront.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
that
i
don't
know.
i
only
know
in
the
two
circuits
where
the
immunity
was
afforded,
that
being
the
sellars
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
powell
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
those
circumstances
they
were
the
kinds
of
background
that
i
have
explained,
were
part
of
the
decision
in
deciding
that
in
fact
butz
be
extended
or
applied
to
a
parole
body.
but,
i
would
point
out,
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
that
this
court
looked
at
a
parole
board
and
characterized
it
as
a
neutral
and
detached
hearing
body,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
that's
true.
that's
not
the
only
requirement,
but
that's--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not
trying
to
make
that
suggestion.
i'm
trying
to
say
that
in
the
decision
maker
there
has
to
be
independence,
there
has
to
be
neutrality,
and
also
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
as
functionally
comparable
to
a
judge,
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
kind
of
factors
that
make
him
alj.
it's
apparent
you
can
look
at
the
kinds
of
things
that
is
required
for
an
alj,
and
that's
what
i
am...
there
should
be
a
distinction,
as
you
have
pointed
out.
it's
not
all
the
same
thing,
but
both
of
those
things
are
important
and
determinative,
whether
in
fact
you've
got
the
independence
and
the
neutrality
that's
so
important
under
butz.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
that's
the
major--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--no,
you
don't.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
there
was.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
there
was.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
because
it
was
linked--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--he
wasn't
a
judge.
his
immunity
was
derivative
in
the
same
way
the
prosecutor's
was.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
the
procedural
safeguards,
the
availability
of
review...
oh,
another
important
one
is
the
use
of
precedent
in
the
decision.
if
you
look
at
an
alj,
they
write
their
own
opinions,
although
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
they
don't
themselves
enter
the
judgments.
they
do
write
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law.
they
have
a
burden
of
proof
which
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence
under
substantial
relevant
evidence.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
it's
definitely
an
important
factor.
judges
come
from
common
law,
common
law
and
statute
with
regard
to
legislature,
it
comes
out
of
statute
and
out
of
the,
i
think
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
none.
none
whatsoever,
and
i
think
the
court
looked
at
that
in
procunier
in
declining
to
give
prison
guards
who
were
making
other
decisions...
that
those
decisions
had
to
do
with
mail
and
the
enforcement
of
mail
regulations
and
decided
that
a
prison
guard
in
that
context
should
have
only
qualified
immunity.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
i--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--no.
i
think
that
we
start
to...
again,
i
think
that
the
witness
immunity
in
briscow,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
was
headed
towards
that
when
you
asked
me
the
question
before,
the
prosecutor's
immunity
in
imbler,
the
grand
jury's
immunity
which
comes
from
common
law
as
well,
are
all,
because
they
are
critical
parts
of
the
judicial
process
of
a
judge
supervised
trial.
i
don't
think
that
a
witness
that
comes
before
a
school
board
or
a
witness
that
comes
before...
because
those
aren't
judicial
proceedings
to
begin
with,
so
i
don't
think
that
the
immunity
would
lie
there.
in
fact,
i
think
we
would
take
the
same
position
of
a
witness
in
front
of
a
prison
disciplinary
board
that
we
would
take
with
regard
to
the
idc
members
themselves.
i
think
that
with
regard
to
the
harassing
litigation
standard
that
the
government
talks
about,
i'd
first
point
out
that
we
don't
reach
that
if
the
butz...
other
two
or
three
standards
that
i've
talked
about
in
butz
are
not
met,
and
we
think
that
clearly
they're
not
met
here.
but
going
to
that
question,
we
think
that
judges
have
more
than
enough
in
their
arsenal
to
deal
with
the
potential
of
harassing
litigation
that
these
allegedly
prodigious
litigators,
that
is
the
prisoners,
as
the
government
would
have
it,
are
going
to
bring
to
the
courts.
it
starts
out
with
the
dismissal
as
frivolous
under,
i
think,
28
u.s.c.
1915,
and
the
district
judge
can
use
that
technique
to
get
rid
of
cases
right
from
the
beginning
that
it
feels
are
not...
do
not
warrant
further
attention.
you
have
the--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
that's
an
untenable
position,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
if
you're
starting
out
with
someone
who's
independent,
who's
in
the
middle,
if
you've
got
three
forces,
you've
got
a
prosecutor,
you've
got
a
defendant,
you've
got
a
judge
and
you
can
see
that
in
all
the
kinds
of
situations
that
get
the
immunity.
that's
one
thing,
but
here
we
have
an
adversarial
situation
to
begin
with.
we
need
a
deterrent
to
bring
that
body
into
some
kind
of
line
with
the
clear
mandates
of
the
constitution,
so
it's
not
like...
i
think
my
experience,
and
i
think
common
sense
would
say
that
in
this
adversarial
situation
we
need
the
deterrent.
it's
not
so
much--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--the
result
that
i
intend
is
that
it
be
deterrence
from
unconstitutional
conduct.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
that
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
circumstance,
yes,
when
you
look
at
the
other
side,
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
of
deterrence,
i
suppose
is
the
government's
argument
of
harassment.
but
legitimate
lawsuits
that
may
get
past
a
harlow
determination
either
on
the
clearly
established
right
or
as
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out,
also
on
whether
it's
a
constitutional
violation
at
all.
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
defined
what
due
process
rights
a
prisoner
has,
and
they
aren't
very
many,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
prison
guard
can
give
those
rights
without
fear
of
any
kind
of
harassing
litigation
because
it
will
go
right
out.
if
the
guard
comes
in
and
says,
i
gave
them
notice
and
i
gave
them
the
other
guarantees
of
wolff,
then
that
should
do
it.
under
harlow,
those
are
the
clearly
established
rights.
the
prisoner
has
no
other
rights
that
he
can
bring
on
the
due
process
context.
so,
only
the
meritorious
cases
will
get
past--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
that
was
a
debate
in
the--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--well,
at
the
trial
warden
benson
testified.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
administrative
paper
itself.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
reason,
i
think,
that
they
gave
was
that
due
process
was
violated.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
i
can't
swear
to
whether
they
said
because
they
brought
those
new
charges
in
the
middle
of
the
hearing.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
at
trial,
what
i
was
trying
to
establish
through
the
regulations
was
that
he...
that
they
expunged
because
he
was
innocent,
because
the
regulations
said
that's
the
only
way
you
can
do
it.
he
was
taking
the
position,
no,
it
wasn't
because
he
was
innocent,
it's
because
his
family
brought
pressure
on
him.
that's
what
i
meant
about
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
in
the
administrative
procedure,
that
he
tried
to
say
it
was
because
of
due
process
violations
and
because
his
father
kept
calling.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
due
process
violations
that
we
claimed
were
the
fact
that
during
the
hearing
itself
they
brought
two
new
charges
which
did
not
conform
to
the
evidence,
did
not
give
him
any
notice
of
them,
and
proceeded
to
try
him
on
it
and
convict
him
of
it
right
there
on
the
spot.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
yes.
well,
exactly,
the
jury
found
the
due
process
violation.
it
received
an
instruction
which
delineated
what
due
process
was
under
wolff.
so,
there
was
no
specific
finding
"x",
it
was
because
of
notice
or
"y",
because--
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
--they
said
due
process,
period,
but
they
were
instructed
on
the
wolff
standards
that
were
clearly
established
as
of
the
time
of
this
trial.
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
1983
or
1985.
we
are
dealing
with
the
record
of
1975.
we
are
dealing
with
what
happened
in
that
context,
with
those
regulations.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
that
would
be
the
carey
versus
piphus
question.
i
think
the
jury
more
or
less
found
that
because
they
wouldn't
have
given
him
$9,000
otherwise.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
and
it
was...
the
evidence
was
so
clear,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
what
he
was
doing,
and
if
you
read
the
record
of
the
proceeding,
that's
all
they're
concerned
about
is
his
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
well,
that's
a
good
question,
because
the
government
raised
that
on
an
nov.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
the
judge
looked
at
the
evidence
and
said
that
the
evidence
of
damage
was
such
that
it
supported
the
verdict
whichever
way
you
looked
at
it.
mr.
g.
flint
taylor,
jr.
no,
it
didn't
take
it
to
the
circuit
or,
of
course,
to
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
