justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
all
procedural
default?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
the
only
ground
on
which
they
appealed,
just
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
we
don't
have
anything
to
do,
then,
with
the
damages,
whether
under
our
cases
the
instructions
on
damages
were--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
there
a
provision
for
the
government
paying
the
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
his
assistants?
justice
byron
r.
white
--furthermore,
he
may
be
stuck
from
time
to
time
because
under
qualified
immunity
standards
he
deserves
to
be
stuck.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
your
argument,
then,
should
be
there
shouldn't
be
any
immunity
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
prosecutors?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
a
charging
party?
doesn't
somebody
actually
make
the
charge
in
the
prison
disciplinary
hearings,
and
they
give
notice
of
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
gives
them...
who
charges
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
the
guard
sued
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
he
at
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happened
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
and
what
was...
was
there
an
argument
about
his
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
qualified
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
warden?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
immunity
issue...
was
it
on
that
basis,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
immunity
for
him,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
argument
for
his
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
immunity
do
parole
and
probation
officers
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
parole?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
where
the
senior
prison
people
who
serve
on
these
boards
come
from,
or
have
they
been
guards
before
or
been
promoted,
or
do
they
have
special
qualifications,
an
elite
corps
that
are
brought
in
from
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
rather...
you
have
tried
a
lot
of
these
cases,
apparently.
how
much
difference
would
it
make
to
you
in
the
bottom
line
as
to
whether
there
is
qualified
or
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove
some...
you
are
going
to
have
to
prove
that
these
people
acted
unreasonably,
if
judged
on
an
objective
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
often
can
you
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
prosecutors,
you
say,
have
sort
of
a
derivative
immunity;
they're
part
of
the
judicial
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
ask
them
how
detached
the
prosecutor
is,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
ask...
in
butz
was
there
also
a
charging
party
involved
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
employed
by
the
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
very
independent,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
are
other
things,
other
than
immunity;
other
things
other
than
independence?
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
you
say
that
guards
who
testify
at
one
of
these
hearings
are...
just
have
qualified
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
wouldn't
enjoy
witnesses'
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
is,
yes,
that
would
be
the
result
and
it's
the
result
that
should
take
place,
namely
that
more
cases
would
be
decided
for
the
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
result
and
that's
exactly
what
you
intend?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
just
puts
it
another
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
grounds
in
the
administrative
appeal
for
setting
aside
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
did
they
write
something?
did
they
tell
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
administrative--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
did
they
give
some
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
respect,
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
he
testify
at
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
what
did
you
claim
in
that
trial,
what
the
due
process
violation
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
what
the
jury
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
said
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
has
never
been
a
determination
that
what
he
was
charged
with
he
didn't
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
they
would
have,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
claim...
do
you
think
that
the
jury
should
have
been
authorized
to
give
this
amount
of
damages
without
a
finding
that
the
defendant
or
the
prisoner
didn't
do
what
he
was
charged
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
didn't
appeal
it?
