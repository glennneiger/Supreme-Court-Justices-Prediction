justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
you
agree
that
each
of
your
petitioners
was
lawfully
convicted
of
the
offenses
for
which
they
were
charged?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
only
debating
the
enhancement
of
the
sentence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
is
it
not
a
fact
that
each
of
the
petitioners
could
have
been
sentenced
to
more
than
the
mandatory
add-on
sentence
if
the
court
had
so
decided?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--may
i
ask
this
question
as
to
how
the
statute
actually
operates?
one
of
the
petitioners,
i
think
it
was
mr.
smalls,
was
sentenced
to
four
to
eight
years--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--apply
the
minimum
mandatory
sentence
to
just
what
the
actual
sentence
was
initially.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand,
i
understand
that,
but
on
remand,
and
if
we
should
affirm,
if
we
should
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
what
would
the
sentence
for
smalls
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
minimum
would
be
five
to
ten?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
he
must
serve
five
years,
but
he
could
be
required
to
serve
another
five?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
beyond
the
eight
that
he
was
initially
sentenced
to?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
am
i
right
that
peterson
was
sentenced
from
one
to
six
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
would
his
sentence
be
on
remand?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
they
would
have
five
years
they
have
to
serve
but
the
next
five
they
could
be
paroled.
