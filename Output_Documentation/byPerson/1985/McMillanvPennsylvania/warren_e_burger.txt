mr.
sosnov,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
that
particular
provision
goes
to
anything
other
than
the
sentence,
the
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
ask
for
that
instruction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute
now.
the
first
amendment,
if
nothing
else,
would
guarantee
you
the
right
to
make
any
objection
you
wanted
to.
the
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
the
statute
might
control
how
the
judge
would
rule,
but
it
would
have
nothing
to
rule
with
what
kind
of
an
objection
you
could
make
to
raise
it.
and
for
all
you
know,
the
judge
might
have
said
that
he
was
going
to
read
the
statute
that
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
they...
how
would
they
get
that,
by
proving
that
there
was
no
firearm
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
since
the
state
was
claiming
it,
would...
if
i
win
a
defense,
he
would
be
free,
or
they,
any
one
of
them
would
be
free
to
shore
that
there
was
no
firearm
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
those
facts?
aren't
all
those
factors
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood,
i
understood
justice
marshall's
question
to
be
directed
at
in
the
second
hearing,
what
would
you
prove
to
offset
the
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
take
this
case,
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
isn't
what
you
want
a...
you
want
this
second
hearing
all
over
with
a
different
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
want
a
hearing
with
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cooperstein?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sosnov?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
