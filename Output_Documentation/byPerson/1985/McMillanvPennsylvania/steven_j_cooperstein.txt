mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
to
clarify
one
fact
about
this
statute
at
issue,
it
is
not
an
enhancement
statute
at
all.
the
statute
sets
forth
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
certain
violent
felonies
that
is
at
all
times
within
the
pre-existing
legislative
range
of
authorized
sentences,
so
this
is
not
an
add-on;
this
is
merely...
all
this
statute
does
is
remove
discretion
from
the
sentencing
court
to
sentence
at
the
low
end
of
the
already
legislatively
determined
scale,
so
that
we
don't
have
the
risk
that
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
tried
to
increase
a
defendant's
penalty
by
hiding
an
element
of
a
crime
and
labeling
it
a
sentencing
factor.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
no,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
permissible.
that
comes
very
close
to
mullaney
v.
wilbur--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--no,
it's
not
precisely
this
case.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
state
has
not
tried
to
distinguish
between
essentially
grades
of
an
offense,
let's
take
robbery.
the
pennsylvania
legislature--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--but
each
one...
the
key
fact
is
how
the
state
views
the
blameworthiness
of
an
individual
crime.
the
state
by
setting
for
robbery,
by
setting
a
20
year
maximum,
shows
that
it
considers
the
crime
of
robbery
at
knifepoint
just
as
blameworthy
as
robbery
at
gunpoint.
it's
just
that
someone
who
commits
a
robber
at
gunpoint
has
no
entitlement
to
a
lenient
sentence.
he
may--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--because
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
if
the
state
considers
the
mental
element
to
be
a
distinguishing
factor
between
one
sentence
and
a
greater
sentence,
the
mental
element
is
so
basic
to
all
definitions
of
crimes
that
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
rearrange.
the
legislature
may
not
take
something
so
fundamental
to
the
definition
of
what
a
crime
is
as
intent
and
rearrange
that.
that's
not
what
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
done
here.
all
it--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
there
is
a
separate
guideline
scheme
in
pennsylvania
where
if
this
mandatory
sentencing
scheme
is
not
applicable,
the
sentencing
judge
must
add
12
to
24
months
to
the
minimum
sentence
if
the
defendant
used
any
weapon.
now,
the
judge
has
some
discretion
to
get
around
that,
but
that's
any
weapon.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
that
is
what
the...
the
judge
in
that
case
and
in
all
four
of
these
cases
declared
the
mandatory
act
unconstitutional
and
sentenced
as
if
it
did
not
exist.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
the
sentence
would
be
a
minimum
of
five
to
ten
years.
in
pennsylvania--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--yes.
in
pennsylvania,
each
judge
must
set
a
minimum
and
a
maximum.
the
minimum
sets
the
parole
eligibility
date.
this
statute
speaks
only
to
the
minimum
sentence,
to
the
parole
eligibility
date,
and
says
that
it
must
be
at
least
five
years.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
because
the...
one
missing
fact
is
that
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
minimum
sentence
must
be
no
greater
than
one
half
of
the
maximum,
so
that
when
it
sets
a
minimum
to
be
a
mandatory
five
years,
it
in
effect
sets
the
maximum
at
a
mandatory
ten
yeas.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes,
peterson.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
her
sentence
would
he
five
to
ten.
each
of
these
defendants
would
receive
a
five
to
ten
year
sentence
under,
under
if
they
were
sentenced
pursuant
to
this
mandatory
scheme.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes,
that
is
correct.
not
only
has
the
pennsylvania
legislature
not
increased
the
sentence
available
to
any
of
these
defendants,
it
also
has
not
changed
the
definition
of
any
crime.
it
has
retained
as
a
separate
crime
possessing
an
instrument
of
the
crime
for
which
a
defendant
may
be
sentenced
to
five
years
in
addition
to
whatever
he
is
sentenced
for
his
basic
offense.
of
course,
the
prosecution
maintains
the
burden
of
proving
such
a
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
it
has
not--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--well,
i
think
the
limits
are,
one
limit
is
clearly
intent,
that
the
state
may
not
move
around
intent
and
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
or
give
the
prosecution
a
lesser
burden.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes,
yes.
of
course,
there
are
exceptions
for
regulatory
offenses.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--i
believe
the
state
would
be
free
to
rearrange
that,
yes,
and
if
i
might
continue
answering
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
patterson
v.
new
york
makes
it
clear...
gives
some
examples
of
the
type
of
thing
that
a
legislature
may
not
do.
it
may
not
declare
a
defendant
presumptively
guilty,
and
i
think
that
goes
beyond
just
a
mere
declaration.
a
court
can
look
at
the
way
in
which
the
legislature
has
defined
its
crimes,
any
way
in
which
it
has
rearranged
its
crimes
and
determine
what
is
it
really
sentencing
the
defendant
for.
here
in
this
case
it's
obvious
that
what
the
legislature
has
done
is
sentence...
is
declare
sentencing
practices
for
robbery,
for
aggravated
assault,
and
for
the
other
crimes.
it
is
clear
that
the
legislature
has
not
tried
to
impose
a
sentence
for
possession
of
a
weapon
and
lightened
the
prosecution's
burden.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
well,
i
think--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--i
think
that
one
has
to
look
at
several
different
factors.
one
that
i
think
is
primary
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislature
has
not
given
the
authority
to
increase
any
sentence,
that
as
long
as
it's
within
the
existing
statutory
maximum,
it
has
not
tried
to
lighten
the
prosecution's
burden.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
one
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
point
to
and
say
anything
over
that
line
is
too
far
and
anything
inside
that
line
is
fine.
i
think
that
all
of
the...
the
whole
statutory
scheme
has
to
be
looked
at.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
i
believe
that
that
would
have
been
permissible
under
the
reasoning
of
patterson
v.
new
york,
yes.
i
might
also
add
that
when
you
look...
one
of
the
things
to
look
at
is
the
purpose
behind
the
statute.
this
was
passed
as
an
amendment
to
the
sentencing
code.
it
was
passed
along
with
two
like
statutes,
one
of
which
imposed
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
crimes
committed
on
public
transportation
and
the
other
is
a
recidivist
section
for
these
violent
felonies
so
that
it's...
when
you
look
at
what
the
pennsylvania
legislature
did
here,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
was
a
bona
fide
sentencing
statute,
it
was
not
some
attempt
to
lighten
the
prosecution's
burden
because
it
had
difficulty
obtaining
convictions.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
i
believe
that
sets
a
much
more
difficult
question.
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
but
in
one--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--well,
i
think
patterson
makes
clear
that
the
way
in
which
a
state
defines
its
crimes
is
entitled...
is
the
dividing
line,
that
when
the
state
seeks
to
treat
one
class
of
robber
different
from
another,
it
has
taken
upon
itself
the
burden--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--however--
mr.
steven
j.
cooperstein
--i'm
not
saying
that
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
said
that
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
this,
than
the
statute
at
issue
here.
i
think
under
patterson
it
may
be
a
constitutional
statute,
the
one
that
you
have
posed
to
me.
i
might
also
add
that,
as
i
think
was
adverted
to
in
mr.
sosnov's
argument,
a
holding
that
this
burden
of
proof
is
unconstitutional
would
have
a
widespread
effect
on
sentencing.
every
sentencing
judge
acting
responsibly
is
going
to
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
is
convicted,
and
certainly
a
primary
fact
about
that
is
what...
how
did
the
defendant
accomplish
its
crime.
all
the
crimes
in
this
pennsylvania
statute
involve
force
or
the
threat
of
force.
all
that
is
done
here
is
the
legislature
has
told
each
sentencing
judge,
if
that
force
was
accomplished
by
means
of
a
firearm,
this
is
how
you
shall
weight
that
particular
factor,
so
that
this
is
not
a
radically
different
sentencing
scheme;
it
merely
directs
the
court
to
make
one
factfinding
and
limits
the
judge's
discretion
accordingly
depending
on
what
fact
he
finds.
unless
there
are
any
other
question,
i
will
rely
on
its
brief.
