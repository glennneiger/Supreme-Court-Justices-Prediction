justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sosnov,
in
these
cases
do
we
know
what
sentences
would
have
been
imposed
apart
from
the
mandatory
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cooperstein,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind.
supposing
you
define
the
crime
of
homicide
as
the
killing
of
another
human
being,
and
the
sentence
for
that
shall
be
anywhere
from
one
year
to
life
at
the
discretion
of
the
judge:
and
in
the
second
paragraph
you
said
if
it
is
proved
at
the
sentencing
hearing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
killing
was
willful,
there
shall
be
a
minimum
sentence
of
15
years,
and
that's
it,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
also...
isn't
that
precisely
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
distinguished
between
robbery
without
a
gun
and
robbery
with
a
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
a
state
treat
all
homicides
as
blameworthy,
just
as
it
treats
all
robberies
as
blameworthy,
justifying
a
penalty
up
to
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
test
that
with
a
question?
supposing
the
crime
of
intentional
stealing,
call
it
larceny,
whatever
it
might
be,
is
punishable
by
a
year
to
five...
a
year
to
ten
years,
say,
and
then
they
say,
but
if
the
amount
stolen
is
over
$1000,
there
shall
be
a
minimum
sentence
of
three
years,
and
that
amount
could
be
proved
by
just
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
an
old
fashioned
distinction
between
petty
larceny
and
grand
larceny?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
intent
in
both
cases.
i
suppose
they
could
rearrange
that
under
your
scheme.
