mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
pennsylvania's
mandatory
sentencing
act
violates
due
process
of
law
because
it
provides
for
proof
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
of
the
legislatively
specified
defense-related
facts
which
require
the
imposition
of
a
mandatory
sentence
of
imprisonment.
the
mandatory
act
provides
that
if
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
one
of
the
numerated
list
of
felonies,
the
commonwealth
may
give
notice
of
its
intention
to
proceed
under
that
act
rather
than
pennsylvania's
discretionary
sentencing
scheme.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
yes.
this
type
of
sentencing
scheme
is
totally
different
from
any
other
type
of
nonmandatory
sentencing
scheme.
in
fact,
the
proceeding
under
the
pennsylvania
mandatory
sentencing
act
is
essentially
a
trial.
there
is
only
one
issue
at
that
proceeding.
the
commonwealth
gives
notice
of
its
intention
to
proceed
under
the
act.
a
hearing
is
required
by
the
act.
at
that
hearing
there
is
but
one
issue,
the
same
issue
that
is
normally
at
a
criminal
trial,
and
the
issue
is
did
the
defendant
commit
the
prohibited
conduct
which
the
state
wishes
to
punish?
in
this
case,
the
question
is
did
defendant
visibly
possess
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
criminal
activity.
at
that
hearing,
the
commonwealth
has
the
burden
of
proof
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
if
the
commonwealth
establishes
the
facts
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
of
five
to
ten
years
must
follow.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--if
at
the
trial
the
pistol
was
exhibited
in
evidence,
and
even
if
defendant
was
convicted
of
an
offense
such
as
possession
of
an
instrument
of
a
crime,
it
is
irrelevant
under
this
statutory
scheme.
this
statutory
scheme
is
set
up
so
that
the
hearing
is
held
separately,
and
that
if
a
defendant--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--justice
marshall,
we
would
not
be
here,
we
would
have
no
complaint
if
in
fact
the
factual
determinations,
visible
possession
of
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
an
offense,
had
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
trial
and
that
defendant
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
deficiency
with
this
statute
is
that
those
factual
determinations
do
not
have
to
be
made
at
trial,
and
that
defendant--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--if
the
jury
was
given,
under
pennsylvania
procedure--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--special
interrogatories
that
provided
the
question:
did
the
defendant
visibly
possess
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
the
offense,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
you
must
find
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
defendant
had
a
right
to
a
jury
determination
of
that
under
pennsylvania
law,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
claim.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
we
could
not
ask
for
that
instruction.
the
act
is
clear.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
we
could
not
because
the
act
is
clear.
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--if
the
judge
did
that,
he
would
be
violating
state
law.
in
other
words,
the
judge
would
be
making
rulings
that
were
directly
contrary
to
what
is
required
by
this
statute.
this
statute
is
very
specific,
it
states
the
applicability
of
this
section
is
to
be
determined
at
sentencing,
so
that
if
the
judge
decided
on
his
own
i
want
to
have
this
determination
made
at
trial,
i
want
all
four
of
the
factual
issues
determined
at
trial:
did
the
defendant
possess
a
firearm
visibly
during
the
commission
of
an
offense,
if
i
wanted
to
do
that
at
trial,
a
judge
would
be
violating
state
law.
the
reason
we
are
here
is
because
this--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--not
only
that,
the
finding
at
trial
would
be
irrelevant
and
nonbinding
because
the
act
is
clear
that
the
procedure
is
one
to
take
place
at
sentencing,
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that's
why
the
verdicts
are
irrelevant
at
trial.
in
fact,
there
was
a
recent
case...
it
is
not
in
my
brief.
it
was
just
reported
last
week,
commonwealth
v.
storm,
at
502
atlantic
2d,
215,
a
superior
court
case
where
defendant
pled
guilty
to
robbing
a
bank
at
gunpoint
and
the
judge
proceeded
to
impose
the
mandatory
sentence
of
five
to
ten
years.
the
superior
court
reversed
because
the
superior
court
held
that
under
this
statutory
scheme,
the
defendant
was
denied
the
hearing
at
sentencing
where
either
side
could
present
evidence,
and
the
determination
as
to
be
made
whether
there
was
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
we
would
have
no
complaint
if
this
statute,
like
all
the
other
statutes
across
this
country,
i
have
attached
as
appendixes
to
my
brief,
the
way
this
is
normally
done
in
every
state
in
this
country,
the
way
it
has
always
been
done,
when
this
factual
determination
determines
a
more
severe
punishment,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required,
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
form
such
a
statute
takes,
whether
it
is
explicitly
an
element
of
the
offense,
such
as
an
armed
robbery
statute,
or
whether
it's
a
separate
offense,
such
as
a
prohibition
against
committing
a
felony
with
a
firearm,
or
whether
it's
part
of
a
penalty
provision,
for
example,
section
924
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
that's
entitled
"penalties"
and
it
provides
for
increased
punishment
if
a
defendant
committed
an
offense
with
a
firearm.
under
all
these
kinds
of
statutes,
historically
and
consistently
it's
been
recognized
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required,
and
that's
because
this
is
an
essential,
critical
fact
in
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
legislature,
the
legislature
has
determined
makes
the
offense
more
serious
and
which
makes
the
penalty
for
the
offense
more
serious.
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey,
which
has
passed
a
similar
act,
stand
alone.
these
are
the
only
two
states
in
this
country
that
have
ever
had
this
legislatively
specified
factual
determination
and
not
required
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
require
proof
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
as
i
said,
they
stand
alone.
in
each
of
the
cases
before
this
court,
there
was
no
hearing
held
pursuant
to
the
mandatory
sentencing
act
because
after
the
commonwealth
gave
notice
of
its
intention
to
proceed
under
the
act,
the
lower
court
judges
held
the
act
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
yes,
they
were
lawfully
convicted
for
the
offenses
which
they
were
charged
with.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
am
only
debating
the
application
of
the
mandatory
sentencing
act,
that
that
act
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
to
three
of
the
four
defendants,
under
the
discretionary
sentencing
scheme,
the
sentence
of
five
to
ten
years
in
prison
mandated
by
this
act
is
the
maximum
for
that
offense,
and
for
one
of
the
defendants,
the
maximum
penalty
was
greater
than
five
to
ten
years.
what
they
have
lost,
of
course,
under
a
scheme
like
this
is
they
have
lost
the
opportunity
for
a
much
lesser
sentence,
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
state
having
a
mandatory
sentencing
act.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
to
get
a
lesser
sentence?
the
defendant
would
not
have
that
burden.
normally--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--any
defendant
would
be
free
in
any
criminal
prosecution
to
cite,
to
prove
anything,
but
the
question
here
i
believe
is
what
burden
of
proof
the
state
has
to
meet
to
provide
for
a
more
severe
punishment.
in
effect
here,
what
pennsylvania
has
done
is
create
two
classes
of
felonies.
right
now,
aggravated
assault,
for
example,
carries
one
punishment
while
aggravated
assault
with
a
firearm
carries
a
more
severe
punishment.
that
is
exactly
what
has
been
done
here.
i
have
set
it
forth
in
a
table
in
my
reply
brief.
the
penalties
are
vastly
different
now
for
whether
you
commit
an
offense
with
a
firearm
or
without
a
firearm.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
do
you
mean
under
a
discretionary
scheme,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
it
would
depend
on
how
that
arose.
if
a
judge
took
it
on
his
own
under
a
discretionary
scheme
to
in
every
case,
ignoring
all
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
background
and
character
of
the
defendant,
the
other
factors
concerning
the
crime,
and
the
judge
said
in
every
case
that
comes
before
me
where
defendant
possesses
a
gun,
i'm
going
to
impose
five
to
ten
years
imprisonment,
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
that's
been
held
by...
it
will
be
reversible
on--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--if
he
says,
if
he
isolated
the
one
factor
and
ignored
his
duty
to
consider
all
the
discretionary
factors,
he
would
be
committing
an
abuse
of
discretion.
it
would
be
reversible
on
that
ground,
and
additionally,
it
may
be
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
because,
in
effect,
he'd
be
ignoring
the
state's
discretionary
sentencing
scheme.
the
difference,
i
think
the
key
difference
between
a
scheme
like
this--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--yes,
we
do,
because
each
of
the
defendants
in
this
case,
because
the
lower
court
judge
concluded
that
the
mandatory
act
was
unconstitutional,
in
each
of
these
cases
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
based
on
the
discretionary
scheme.
we
have
sentences
here
ranging
from
11
1/2
to
23
months
imprisonment
on
the
low
end,
to
four
to
eight
years.
each
of
the
four
defendants
has
received
a
sentence
below
that
mandated
by
the
mandatory
sentencing
act.
the
essential
difference
between
a
discretionary
sentencing
scheme
where
a
judge
considers
a
whole
host
of
factors,
indeed,
must
in
deciding
on
a
proper
sentence
to
impose,
and
this
sentencing
scheme,
is
it
is
nothing
like
these
other
sentencing
schemes.
it
is
simply
like
a
trial.
there
is
only
one
issue.
the
issue
is
did
the
defendant
commit
the
prohibited
conduct?
in
essence,
what
pennsylvania
has
done
here
is
they
have
set
up
a
bifurcated
trial
proceeding.
you
first
determine
at
trial,
for
purpose
of
this
act,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
did
the
defendant
commit
a
robbery,
and
then
you
take
the
tradition
element
of
the
offense,
was
he
armed,
and
you
determine
that
after
trial
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
is
all
that
has
happened
here.
once
we
get
beyond
the
label
of
sentencing,
it's
a
lot
like
the
winship
case.
in
winship
there
was
a
claim
it's
a
juvenile
adjudication.
it's
only
civil.
therefore
there's
no
need
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
and
what
this
court
did
is
it
examined
the
operation
of
the
statute,
and
the
operation
of
the
adjudicatory
scheme
for
juveniles
was
that
a
juvenile
was
accused
of
committing
conduct
which
the
state
wished
to
punish,
essentially
a
criminal
act.
and
if
those
facts
were
found,
if
those
facts
were
established,
then
confinement
could
result
as
a
proof
of
those
facts.
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
only
one
issue
at
this
hearing,
the
issue,
did
he
do
it?
did
he
commit
the
conduct
the
state
wishes
to
punish?
and
if
in
fact
those
facts
were
established,
the
judge
has
no
choice
the
inevitable
consequences
follow
just
like
at
a
trial,
five
to
ten
years
imprisonment.
if
in
fact
in
a
situation
like
this
the
constitutional
line
is
not
drawn
here
and
pennsylvania
is
permitted
to
do
this,
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey,
aside
from
the
whole
trend
of
our
jurisprudence,
there
is
really
no
place
to
draw
the
constitutional
line
because
in
essence,
and
in
mullaney
v.
wilbur,
this
court
emphasized
this,
this
court
emphasized
the
problem
that
a
state
might
take
the
traditional
element
of
the
offense,
the
state
might
transpose
that
traditional
element
of
the
offense
into
a
sentencing
statute
where
it
had
the
exact
same
effect
on
the
defendant.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
the
judge,
as
long
as
the
judge
did
his
duty,
as
i
responded
before
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
as
long
as
the
judge
did
his
duty,
considering
all
the
factors,
he
certainly
could
consider
this
factor,
and
the
difference
between
a
proceeding
like
that
an
this
proceeding
is
there
are
no
legislatively
specified
facts
which
have
to
be
determined
by
the
judge
and
which
have
inevitable
consequences
which
follow.
as
this
court
said
in
bullington
v.
missouri,
in
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion,
the
normal
sentencing
proceeding
is
not
a
search
for
facts.
it
is
a
question
of
looking
at
the
character
of
the
defendant,
his
conduct,
his
past
background,
and
meting
out
just
desserts,
considering
a
whole
host
of
factors.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that's
right,
but
the
process
is
completely
different
because
the
process,
unlike
a
trial,
the
process
is
not
a
search
for
legislatively
defined
issues,
and
they
don't
have
inevitable
consequences
which
follow
just
like
at
a
trial.
in
other
words,
to
impose...
if
this
court,
for
example,
said
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
every
fact
at
a
sentencing
proceeding,
that
wouldn't
make
much
sense
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
one
reason
is
it
would
be
impractical.
in
other
words,
in
every
sentencing
proceeding,
the
factors
that
a
judge
considers
in
the
characterization
of
the
defendant
will
vary.
there
will
be
a
whole
host
of
different
factors
in
every
sentencing
proceeding.
it
would
be
impractical
to
have
a
minitrial
on
each
fact,
each
incidental
fact
which
went
into
a
judge's
consideration
of
sentencing.
again,
it
would
be
impractical
to
have
a
shifting
burden
of
proof
to
examine
every
sentencing
hearing,
look
at
that
sentencing
hearing
and
decide,
well,
on
this
sentencing
hearing
i've
got--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--in
some
cases,
obviously
unless
we
had
this
hearing
where
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
was
the
standard,
the
separate
hearing,
in
some
cases
defendant
is
going
to
lose.
in
other
words--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--in
that
particular
situation?
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
would
think
if
he
wanted
to
he
might
come
up
with
some
countervailing
evidence,
but
he
would
probably
lose,
but
that's
true
with
any
burden
of
proof.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
there
would
be--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--in
that
hypothetical,
in
that
hypothetical,
it
would
be
very
difficult,
even
if
the
proof
burden
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
for
that
defendant
to
have
a
chance
of
prevailing
and
winning
at
it.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
the
same,
justice
marshall--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--justice
marshall,
but
the
same...
i
think
the
problem
with
that
hypothetical
is
the
same
hypothetical
could
be
given
for
trial.
in
other
words,
a
man
approaches
trial
and
there
are
87
witnesses
who
say
they
saw
him
commit
a
robbery,
that
he
visibly
possessed
a
firearm
and
he
committed
a
robbery,
87
witnesses,
the
defense
has
no
witnesses
to
offer,
would
this
court,
if
the
jury
was
charged
or
state
law
provided
that
a
conviction
could
be
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
this
court
would
not
tolerate
that.
it's
not
a
question
of
retrospectively
looking
back
at
the
facts
in
a
particular
case
and
saying
in
that
particular
case
what
would
have
been
that
defendant's
chances
of
winning
at
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
regulates--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
will
take,
for
example,
in
mr.
mcmillan's
case,
given
this
statutory
framework,
in
mr.
mcmillan's
case,
mr.
mcmillan
was
convicted
at
trial
of
aggravated
assault,
of
shooting
another
individual.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury.
there
was
one
witness
against
mr.
mcmillan
at
trial,
and
that
witness
had
a
criminal
record,
and
that
witness
first
told
the
police,
i
don't
know
who
shot
me.
he
was
the
sole
witness
against
mr.
mcmillan,
the
jury
was
out
quite
a
long
time.
mr.
mcmillan
wanted
to
testify
at
trial
that
he
didn't
do
it,
but
because
he,
too,
had
a
criminal
record
and
the
judge
ruled
that
the
criminal
record
would
be
admissible
at
the
trial,
mr.
mcmillan
decided
not
to
testify
at
trial.
mr.
mcmillan
at
sentencing
again
said
he
didn't
do
it.
if
mr.
mcmillan
had
had
a
separate
hearing,
a
hearing
with
a
burden
of
proof
by
more
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
mr.
mcmillan
may
indeed
prevail
before
the
judge
at
that
hearing.
in
other
words,
the
judge
could
be
faced
with
conflicting
versions
of
the
same
event
by
two
different
people.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
first
of
all--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--in
this,
in
this,
mr.
mcmillan's
case,
the
jury
was
the
factfinder,
so
the
judge
did
not
find
the
facts.
and
pennsylvania
law
has
provided
that
indeed
that's
the
procedure.
the
procedure
is
that
at
the
hearing
there
is
a
separate
determination,
and
at
that
separate
determination,
either
side
shall
present
whatever
evidence
they
wish
to
offer.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
if
you
rule
our
way,
our
clients
will
be
sentenced
as
they
are
pursuant
to
a
valid,
discretionary
sentencing
scheme.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
they've
all
gone
to
jail.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
they've
all
gone
to
jail.
we
have
no
complaint
about
them
going
to
jail.
we
are
asking
that
they
be
sentenced
pursuant
to
a
valid
discretionary
scheme
rather
than
a
constitutionally
invalid
scheme,
and
in
this
court
in
hicks
v.
oklahoma
said
that
defendant
certainly
has
a
due
process
liberty
interest
in
being
sentenced
pursuant
to
a
valid
discretionary
scheme.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
second
hearing.
every
state
in
this
country...
we
are
not
asking
for
two
trials
with
a
jury.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
we
are
saying
that
pennsylvania
does
not
have
to
do
it
as
a
second
hearing
with
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
a
jury
trial;
pennsylvania
can
provide
that
all
this
be
done
at
trial.
in
other
words,
if
pennsylvania
provides
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
visible
possession
of
a
firearm
during
the
commission
of
the
defense
is
to
be
determined
by
the
jury
trial,
like--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--by
a
lower
burden
of
proof
and
without
a
jury
trial,
and
that's
why
it
is
violating
the
constitution.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
governed
because--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--for
one,
it
does
not
have
the
legislatively
mandated
deprivation
of
liberty
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that
i
think
presents
separate
issues
because
it
is
not
offense
related.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
think
there
are
key
differences
there,
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
always
held,
in
winshin,
in
mullaney,
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required
for
offense
related
facts,
the
question
what
did
he
do,
what
offense
did
he
commit.
historical
facts
such
as
his
background,
his
prior
record,
have
always
been
recognized
as
sentencing
determinations.
we
have
no
risk
in
that
situation
of
the
state
taking
elements
of
the
offense
and,
putting
them
in
a
statute
at
a
lesser
burden
of
proof.
there's
an
entirely
different
set
of
circumstances
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
oyler
v.
boles,
whether
somebody
is
a
recidivist
is
essentially
independent
of
the
crime
which
the
defendant
is
accused
of
committing
which
the
state
is
trying
to
punish.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
points
briefly.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
a
factor:
it
is
the
factor,
and
that
is
why
in
essence
pennsylvania
created
two
classes
of
felonies.
there's
inevitable
consequences
just
as
at
trial
when
that
additional
fact
is
proven.
the
line
suggested
by
the
commonwealth
of
mens
rea
being
the
only
element
of
an
offense
that
cannot
be
switched
to
a
sentencing
statute,
a
mandatory
sentencing
statute,
is
ridiculous.
it's
no
line
at
all.
if
the
commonwealth
is
correct,
then
our
robbery
statutes
can
be
rewritten
just
like
this
statute
to
provide
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
required
for
proof
that
a
defendant
stole
something,
but
the
penalty
of
five
to
ten
years
would
be
mandated
if
at
sentencing
it
is
shown
that
there
was
force,
physical
force
used
in
the
taking.
they
could
take
every
traditional
statute,
take
an
aggravated
assault
statute
which
provides
that
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
that
somebody
struck
somebody
and
serious
bodily
injury
occurred.
according
to
the
commonwealth's
theory,
since
that
did
not
involve
mens
rea
the
seriousness
of
the
injury,
you
could
take
that
fact
out
and
put
it
in
a
sentencing
statute;
it
would
have
the
exact
same
effect
on
a
defendant
but
on
a
lower
burden
of
proof.
i
think
if
we
talk
about
a
slippery
slope
here,
the
slippery
slope
is
if
this
act
is
upheld
because
then
basically,
constitutionally,
anything
goes.
it
will
not
affect
in
any
way
traditional
discretionary
sentencing
hearings
for
this
court
to
hold
this
act
unconstitutional.
a
judge
will
be
free,
as
he
always
has
been
free,
and
as
the
judges
in
these
very
cases
did,
to
consider
at
sentencing
every
important
factor,
including
if
defendant
had
a
gun.
each
of
these
cases
the
judge
considered
all
of
the
factors
mandated
by
a
discretionary
scheme,
and
in
each
case
the
defendant
received
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
however,
what
he
did
not
receive
is
a
mandated
sentence
of
imprisonment
based
on
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
without
a
jury
determination
to
critical
facts.
thank
you.
