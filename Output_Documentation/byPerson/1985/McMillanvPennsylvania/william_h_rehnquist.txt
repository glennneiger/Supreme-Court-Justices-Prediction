you
would
still,
you
would
still
have
to
make
the
determination
at
sentencing,
i
take
it,
under
state
law,
even
if
the
judge
went
ahead
and
wrongly
decided
he
would
also
find
it
at
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel,
what
if
in
this
case
the
elements
of
the
crime
had
not
included
committing
it
with
a
gun
and
at
the
sentencing
stage
the
judge
says,
well,
i
notice
in
the
probation
report
here
that
you
had
a
gun
when
you
committed
this
assault,
and
i
always
take
that
into
consideration
in
sentencing
someone,
so
i
am
giving
you
three
years
instead
of
six
months,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
anything
in
the
federal
constitution?
