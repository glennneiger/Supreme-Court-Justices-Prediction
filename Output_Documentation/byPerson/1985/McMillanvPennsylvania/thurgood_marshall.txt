justice

marshall
i
think
what
the
chief
judge
is
driving
at,
if
the
arm,
the
pistol
was
in
evidence
at
the
trial
itself
and
was
exhibit
a,
what
more
do
you
need?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
hearing
do
you
need
more
than
to
look
at
the
pistol?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
jury
in
a
special
verdict
said
he
did
shoot
the
man,
he
did
rob
the
man
with
a
pistol?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
answered
it
a
little
while
back,
but
just
once
again,
this
trial,
a
gun
is
in
evidence,
is
exhibit
a,
there
are
87
witnesses
that
testify
that
he
held
up
the
person
with
the
gun,
and
the
jury
finds
that
he
held
up
the
person
with
the
gun,
my
only
question
now
is
what
evidence
could
he
give
to
save
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean...
just
give
me
the
evidence
that
any
person
you
can
imagine
would
give.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
agree,
you
agree
there
was
no
way
he
could
escape
being
said
to
have
had
the
gun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
good
would
the
hearing
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i've
given
you
whatever
hypothetical
you
could
imagine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
order
to
do
that,
would
the
judge
have
to
say
i
was
wrong
in
convicting
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
going
to
say
one,
he
had
a
gun,
another
time
he
didn't
have
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
rule
with
you,
what
outcome
will
you
and
your
clients
get
other
than
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
still
go
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cooperstein,
i
doubt
that
you
know
the
answer,
but
why
did
they
just
limit
it
to
firearms
and
not
knives
and
other
deadly
weapons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
weapon--
