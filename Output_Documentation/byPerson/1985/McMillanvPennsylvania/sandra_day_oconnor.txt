justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
sosnov,
you
take
the
position
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
invalidation
of
this
scheme,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
defendant
were
to
be
sentenced
by
a
judge
who
simply
takes
the
position
that
if
somebody
commits
an
assault
with
a
firearm,
by
gum,
i'm
going
to
give
him
five
years?
is
that
a
violation
of
due
process
because
the
judge
determines
that
for
himself
and
imposes
the
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
he
says
at
least
five
years.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
isn't
what
pennsylvania
did.
so
what
pennsylvania
wants
done
is
to
have
it
done
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
started
your
argument,
mr.
sosnov,
with
the
assertion
that,
well,
this
only
involves
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey,
but
what
about
the
states
that
require
by
legislative
action
that
restitution
be
ordered
to
victims
of
crimes
where
there's
been
a
pecuniary
loss,
and
that
the
sentencing
judge
determine
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
how
much
is
to
be
repaid
by
the
defendant
in
restitution,
would
your
argument
reach
those
cases
as
well?
would
that
be
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
it's
a
legislatively
mandated
fact
that
has
severe
consequences
for
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
might
have
if
he
doesn't
pay
what's
ordered,
off
he
goes
to
jail.
what
about,
and
what
about
the
enhancements
for
repeaters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cooperstein,
what
are
the
limits
on
the
state's
power
to
take
something
that
looks
a
lot
like
an
element
of
a
crime
in
most
states
and
label
it
a
sentencing
consideration
in
your
view?
what
are
the
limits
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
mens
rea
element?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
hear
the
words,
but
i
don't
have
a
clear
picture
in
my
mind
of
what
the
constitutional
line
is
in
your
view--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
this
court
has
drawn.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
this
statute
have
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
didn't
have
visible
possession
of
a
firearm?
