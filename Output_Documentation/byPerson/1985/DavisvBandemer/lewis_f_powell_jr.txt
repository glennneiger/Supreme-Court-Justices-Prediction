mr.
evans,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
putting
the
racial
issue
aside,
is
it
your
position,
if
the
one-man,
one-vote
rule
is
satisfactorily
met,
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case
and
nothing
else
is
to
be
considered
by
us.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
putting
the
racial
issue
aside.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
that
rule
is
met,
is
that
the
end
of
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
position
then
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
no
application
to
the
case
at
all?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me.
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear,
in
your
view
the
equal
protection
clause
has
no
applicability
absent
discrimination
against
race,
or
some
other
minority?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
by
gerrymandering,
one
party
could
put
the
other
party
entirely
out
of
business,
entirely,
if
you
were
using
the
computer,
without
discriminating
against
the
voters
in
the
other
party?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
republican
majority
consider
any
purpose
in
adopting
this
plan
other
than
maximize
the
republican
vote
and
minimize
the
democratic
vote?
did
it
have
any
other
purpose?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
i
read
the
record
that
the
speaker
of
the
house
said
the
only
purpose
was
political,
just
to
maximize
the
republican
vote?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
other
purposes
were
considered
by
the
legislature
that
are
effected
in
the
record
or
by
findings
of
the
district
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
apart
from
that,
what
other
things?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
did
not
have
very
much
time,
did
they,
in
view
of
the
schedule
followed
by
the
republican
majority?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
the
legislature
the
plan
was
adopted,
as
i
recall,
on
either
the
last
or
the
next
to
the
last
day
of
the
session.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
democrats
on
the
conference
committee,
were
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
apply
the
rational
basis
standard
in
your
equal
protection
analysis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
perhaps
not
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
the
blacks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
community
of
interest
a
factor
that
properly
may
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
plan?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
court
thought
community
of
interest
was
fairly
important?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
one
could
agree
with
that.
but
it
did
say
that
little
attention
was
given
to
community
of
interest
in
a
number
of
districts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
no
other
plan
to
compare
it
with?
