mr.
william
m.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1981
the
indiana
legislature
passed
a
reapportionment
act
following
the
1980
census
and
this
act
was
modified
and
amended
in
certain
minor
respects
in
1982.
the
defendants,
the
democrats
in
this
case,
did
not
apparently,
according
to
the
record,
pursue
their
legislative
remedies
any
further
and
there's
no
evidence
that
in
1983,
the
1983
general
session
of
the
indiana
general
assembly,
that
they
introduced
any
bill
in
the
legislature
to
try
to
change
the
reapportionment
act
in
any
way.
so,
instead
of
pursuing
a
legislative
remedy
before
the
indiana
voters,
they
chose
to
attempt
a
judicial
remedy
in
the
federal
court
and
filed
their
lawsuit
in
federal
court
in
1982.
this
case
is
before
the
court,
and
it
is
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
high
visibility
case,
and
a
lot
of
articles
in
the
newspaper
about
this
case.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
because
of
the
strange
alignment
of
parties
on
both
sides
of
this
appeal.
but,
i
don't
believe
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
all
that
novel,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
past
opinions
has
in
fact
considered
many
of
the
issuers
that
are
before
the
court
today.
so,
i
will
start
my
argument
with
a
discussion
of
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1971,
which
i
feel
deals
with
many
of
the
issues
that
the
court
has
in
our
briefs
this
morning.
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
was
a
case
that
came
from
indiana,
involved
the
same
state,
involved
the
same
county,
marion
county,
and
involved
the
same
city,
of
indianapolis,
and
even
involved
on
the
three-judge
panel
a
district
court
judge
on
that
panel
in
1969,
who
is
also
on
the
panel
of
this
appeal
today.
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
this
court
first
of
all
carefully
considered
the
question
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
electoral
rules
and
laws
in
indiana
involving
particularly
multi-member
districts
in
1969.
and
what
this
court
says
is
a
matter
of
racial
discrimination,
they
said
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
multi-member
districts
which
had
existed
in
indiana
for
many,
many
years
were
created,
designed
or
maintained
to
further
racial
discrimination.
in
making
that
statement,
in
the
opinion
by
justice
white,
be
mentioned
the
sims
v.
baggett
case
as
an
example
of
what
he
meant.
that
was
a
district
court
case
where
the
blacks
were
gaining
political
power
under
a
single-member
district
system,
and
all
of
a
sudden,
for
the
sole
reason
of
defeating
black
voting
strength
in
that
case,
the
issue
the
court
found,
they
went
to
multi-member
district
system.
and
obviously,
the
court
said
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
that
is
a
discriminatory
use
of
multi-member
districts,
and
the
court
struck
it
down
in
sims
v.
baggett.
but
in
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case,
this
court
said
it
found
no
evidence
in
indiana
of
racial
discrimination
at
all.
the
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
there
had
been
multi-member
districts
for
many
years,
and
there
had
been
a
mix
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
multi-member
and
single-member
districts,
again
for
many,
many
years.
so,
the
court
considered
this
racial
question
first
of
all,
which
obviously
is
of
great
concern
to
this
court,
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
minority
of
black
citizens
of
indiana.
then
it
went
on
and
it
looked
at
the
kind
of
people
that
were
raising
a
question,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
who
were
ghetto
question
poor
in
the
center
of
indianapolis.
and,
this
court
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
said
that
those
voters
were
overwhelmingly
democrat
voters.
so
the
court,
then,
was
dealing
with
a
racial
question
put
aside
with
a
question
of
outvoted
democrats
in
the
center
of
indianapolis
and
what
their
constitutional
rights
were.
mr.
william
m.
evans
justice
o'connor,
in
this
case
the
lower
court
did,
and
this
makes
this
case
so
different
from
other
cases
because
in
this
case
the
lower
court
said,
there
has
been
no
violation
by
this
reapportionment
act
in
indiana
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
right
of
black
citizens
under
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
justify
any
relief
on
the
part
of
black
voters,
and
there
was
some
plaintiffs
where
the
naacf
filed
an
action,
a
companion
action
and
the
court
denied
their
claim
and
they
have
not
cross-appealed
at
all.
so,
it
is
fair
to
say,
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
in
indiana,
from
the
record,
nor
is
there
any
in
this
case
before
the
court
today.
so,
we
have
to
put
race
to
one
side.
and
then
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
decision
by
justice
white,
he
said,
what
constitutional
rights
do
outvoted
democrats
have
as
a
political
group
in
the
center
of
indianapolis,
and
he
very
carefully
looked
to
the
question,
are
they
able
to
participate
in
the
political
process.
did
these
ghetto
poor
citizens
have
a
right
to
vote?
did
they
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
party,
their
party,
the
democratic
party?
were
they
hurt?
were
they
an
effective
force?
and,
the
court
said,
yes,
they
were
and
perhaps
anticipating
the
court's
decision
later
in
white
v.
regester,
the
court
found
that
not
to
be
true
with
blacks
around
dallas,
texas.
but
here
the
court
said
all
political
processes
had
been
met
in
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case
and
therefore
these
outvoted
democrats
have
no
constitutional
right
to
a
remedy.
and
the
court
said,
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
again,
this
is
true
whether
we're
dealing
with
multi-member
districts
or
single-member
districts.
in
our
system
of
government,
the
court
said,
where
you
have
a
majority
rule
some
people
win;
some
people
lose.
we
don't
have
a
proportional
representation
system.
the
court
could
find
no
need
to
give
constitutional
remedies
where
in
any
particular
district,
single-member
or
multi-member,
you
have
a
situation
where
one...
adherents
of
one
party
lose,
even
if
they
might
be
in
what
the
court
said
was
a
safe
district,
and
that
might
be
true
year
after
year
after
year.
that
was
the
political
system
set
forth
by
the
indiana
legislature
and
the
court
found
no
constitutional
wrong
with
that.
so,
the
court
went
on
and
finally
said,
perhaps
the
idea
of
cancelling
the
vote
is
a
euphemism
for
political
defeat
at
the
polls,
so
in
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case
this
court
was
considering
a
claim
of
a
political
group,
namely
the
outvoted
democrats
in
the
city
of
indianapolis.
now,
in
dissent...
the
opinion
was
written
by
justice
white
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun,
but
in
dissent
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
did
not
argue
with
that
point.
they
said
that
an
ideological
political
interest
group
does
not
the
constitutional
protections
as
is
true
of
black
citizens,
because
they
mention
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
they
mention
the
civil
war
amendments
which
were
designed
to
help
black
citizens
in
their
constitutional
rights.
so,
we
have...
these
justices,
i
feel,
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
have
taken
a
strong
stand
that
what
the
indiana
general
assembly
did
in
1981-'82
is
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
m.
evans
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
evans
we
had
thought
of
gaffney,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
evans
i
am,
your
honor,
but
we
are
here.
mr.
william
m.
evans
we
are
here
today,
so
the
court
must
be
interested
in
the
question,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
issue
is
not
justiciable,
and
in
the
briefs
we
went
into
that
at
great
length
and
the
court,
i
assume,
is
familiar
with
the
legal
arguments.
i
am
trying
to
say
it
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
william
m.
evans
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
position.
i
do
not
believe
it
was
justiciable
at
all.
i
believe,
if
the
court
were
to
think
about
it,
who
in
this
room
could
say
how
many
republicans
and
how
many
democrats
should
serve
in
the
indiana
general
assembly?
those
kind
of
judgments
are
inherently
political
and
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
a
court
to
come
up
with
in
acceptable
standard.
mr.
william
m.
evans
your
honor,
i
believe
particularly
where
we're
dealing
with
two
major
parties,
i
believe
that
is
true.
i
believe
that
ever
since
the
carrollton
province
case
where
this
court
showed
special
concern
for
discrete
and
isolated
minorities,
the
court
has
some
duty
and
as
justice
marshall
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
mobile
v.
bolden
case,
you
take
a
group
that
has
been
discriminated
against
for
a
long
time,
decades
and
decades,
and
cannot
because
of
that
past
discrimination
and
the
effect
of
the
civil
rights
amendment,
can't
have
their
views
presented
through
the
political
process,
that
might
give
rise
to
a
need
for
some
sort
of
judicial
relief.
but,
when
you
are
dealing
with
two
major
political
parties,
i
would
say
under
no
conditions--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--i
believe
the
court
made
that
distinction
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
your
honor,
and
i
was
in
my
argument
making
that
distinction.
i
think
that
is
an
important
distinction,
because
i
think
this
court
is--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--oh,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
evans
but
racial
is.
mr.
william
m.
evans
and
has
been,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
william
m.
evans
yes,
and
in
the
gaffney
case
the
court
did
review
and
approved
the
reapportionment
plans
in
the
gaffney
case.
and
that
case
is
interesting,
speaking
of
the
question
of
seat
vote
ratios
which
were
so
important
to
the
lower
court
here,
it
said
in
indiana
that
51.9
percent
of
the
votes
were
for
the
democrats
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
they
only
got
43
seats
in
the
1982
election.
that
was
one
of
the
main,
perhaps
the
single
most
important
point
in
the
minds
of
the
two-to-one
majority
in
our
case.
but
in
gaffney
v.
cummings
we
have
a
situation
where
the
seat
vote
differential
was
greater
than
even
that
differential,
and
the
court
upheld
the
1972
election
which
was
part
of
the
record
in
gaffney
v.
cummings.
but,
i
am
only
now
speaking
of
the
justiciability
or
non-justiciability
of
partisan
gerrymandering.
mr.
william
m.
evans
that
is
our
position.
mr.
william
m.
evans
racial
issue
aside,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
when
the
court
in
wells
v.
sims
and
other
cases
in
the
early
'60s
established
a
one-vote,
one-person
rule
based
upon
residence
of,
everybody's
vote
is
the
same,
has
equal
weight,
i
think
that
was
a
rule
that
was
well
accepted
in
the
nation.
mr.
william
m.
evans
yes,
that
is
the
end
of
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
evans
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
what
this
court
should
do,
when
it
gets
a
case
by
someone
who
is
not
a
discrete
and
insular
minority,
particularly
somebody
represented
by
the
powerful...
one
of
the
major
political
parties
in
this
country,
that
the
court
should
not
get
involved
in
that
particular
political
thicket.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
evans
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
correct,
where
you
have,
as
i
say,
two
major
political
parties
as
we
have
in
this
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
intended
or
designed
to
give
protection
to
one
major
party
in
this
context.
mr.
william
m.
evans
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
question
has
been
raised,
perhaps
by
justice
powell
in
some
of
your
arguments.
i
believe
that
that
is
true.
i
believe
that
where
you
have
two
major
parties,
either
party
may
have
the
use
of
a
computer.
i
don't
believe
the
computer
in
itself
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
believe
that
where
you
have
a
situation
where
this
question
is
presented,
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
situation
where
the
democrats
did
not
present
their
point,
apparently
again
to
the
voters
of
indiana
to
try
to
get
some
relief,
we
had
a
situation,
remember...
i
believe
justice
stevens
when
he
was
still
in
chicago
commented
that
the
original
gerrymandering
was
reversed
by
the
massachusetts
legislature
and
the
next
year
or
so
through
the
normal
political
process.
i
have
great
confidence
in
the
political
process,
and
i
believe
in
indiana
that
in
due
time
it
changes.
these
things
do
change.
mr.
william
m.
evans
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
was
even
their
purpose.
mr.
william
m.
evans
the
speaker
of
the
house
was
quoted
as
saving
words
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
you
are
correct
about
that.
he
did
say
that.
but
that's
not
a
finding
by
the
court
at
all.
that's
a
statement
of
the
house
leader.
and,
what
you
have,
frankly,
is
a
political
statement.
you
are
dealing
with
a
very
political
subject.
i
ask
the
court
whether
it
would
be
better
to
have
candor
or,
as
justice
stevens
said,
litigation
oriented
silence.
of
course,
when
you
are
dealing
with
this
subject
you
are
going
to
have
partisan
comments
made
on
both
sides.
one
can
hardly
expect
the
leader
of
a
party
to
say,
"i
am
going
to
help
my
opponents.
"
it
is
a
political
statement.
i
think
the
thing
the
court
should
do
is
look
at,
as
we
say,
the
bottom
line.
what
was
the
effect
of
the
reapportionment
on
the
democrats?
what
was
actually
done?
we
know,
for
example,
that
the
republicans
saved
a
seat
for
the
democrats
in
the
house
in
marion
county
where
there
was
a
vast
movement
out
of
blacks,
which
were
democrats.
mr.
william
m.
evans
one-man,
one-vote
was
met.
that
the
first
criterion.
mr.
william
m.
evans
then
the
record
is
clear
that
the
rights
of
black
citizens,
black
vote,
was
absolutely--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--the
legislature
then
followed
the
tests
under
the
state
law
which
were
emphasized
by
this
court
in
karcher.
for
example,
they
avoided
contests
between
incumbents;
they
preserved
the
core
of
previous
districts,
were
two
state
guidelines
that
were
followed.
i
think
before
the
court
can
make
a
judgment
on...
that
you
might
be
interested,
you
must
recognize
that
no
other
alternative
plan
was
ever
presented
in
the
indiana
general
assembly.
mr.
william
m.
evans
well,
your
honor,
they
had
about
as
much
time
as
the
republicans
did.
the
census
tapes
were
made
available
in
early
or
middle
of
april
of
1981,
and
they
did
not
hire
a
computer,
that
is
true.
but,
after
the
case
was
over,
i
mean,
after
the
legislature
was
over,
we
had
a
trial
in
the
fall
of
1983,
there
were
no
alternative
plans
presented
to
the
three-judge
panel.
no
alternative
plans
have
ever
been
presented,
nor
to
this
court,
that
follow
the
guidelines
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
william
m.
evans
your
honor,
you
are
right.
it
is
a
very
complicated
piece
of
legislation
and
as
necessary
as
all
very
difficult
legislation
is
in
the
state
legislature,
it
sometimes
takes
the
last
day
to
get
these
things
done.
it
was
done
on
the
last
day,
but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--no
democrats
were
on
the
conference
committee,
your
honor,
but
i
wonder
if
this
court
wants
to
draw
great
weight
on
that.
again,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
line,
what
was
the
effect,
what
happened,
and
we
know
one
thing.
we
know
the
democrat
leader
himself
maid
that
republicans
were
piggish.
they
had
so
many
republican
elected
in
the
reagan
landslide
of
1980
that
they
only
had
so
many
votes
to
go
around,
so
meeting
all
these
guidelines,
there
were
so
many
marginal
districts
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
democrats
could
win
in
a
good
democrat
year.
we
know
based
upon
their
own
exhibits,
their
own
statistics,
there
were
67
seats
in
the
house
in
the
1982
election
that
were
either
safe
democrat
seats
or
competitive
seats
within
a
45
to
55
percent
range,
67
out
of
100
seats
in
the
indiana
house.
that
is
the
result
of
the
reapportionment.
now,
if
we
have
candidates
that
can't
move
with
that
kind
of
a
chance,
i
think
that's
not
a
problem
this
court
need
address.
as
i
say,
there
are
some
justices
who
would
perhaps
look
at
this
question,
on
the
question
of
rationality.
is
it
rational?
was
the
plan
entirely
motivated
by
a
desire
to
severely
damage
the
other
party?
that
question
has
been
raised
by
some
of
the
justices,
and
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
that.
amplifying
on
what
i
said
to
justice
powell,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
indiana
legislature,
consistently
throughout
the
state,
without
question,
all
over
the
state
followed
these
guidelines.
now,
in
the
karcher
case
we
have
just
the
opposite.
in
the
karcher
case
there
was
a
justification
offered
of
not
diluting
the
black
voting
strength.
but
the
district
court
said,
that
is
not
true
because
in
the
fourth
district
in
karcher
where
i
think
there
was
a
17
percent
black
majority
vote,
the
court
said...
they
just
ignored
that.
they
did
not
adjust
that.
they
did
not
take
any
effect
to
protect
the
black
voting
strength
in
the
fourth
district.
just
the
opposite
here.
the
court
found
in
indiana
that
the
general
assembly
did
in
fact
protect
the
black
vote,
so
we
have
a
fact.
it
is
rational,
and
no
one
has
to
re-invent
the
wheel.
the
legislature
has
districts
that
are
multi-member.
they
didn't
have
to
go
to
single-member
districts.
they
had
a
right
to
take
what
they
had
before
them
in
the
background
of
the
whitcomb
v.
chavis
case.
they
knew
multi-member
districts
were
proper.
so,
they
used
multi-member
districts
in
the
new
plan
and
they
went
ahead
with
what
they
had,
took
care
of
the
blacks,
took
care
of
the
one-man,
one-vote.
those
were
their
top
priorities.
mr.
william
m.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
m.
evans
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
believe
it
is
unfair
to
say
that
this
plan
was
an
arbitrary
plan
adopted
by
the
indiana
general
assembly,
because
no
plan
was
presented
to
the
legislature
or
to
the
courts
that
followed
the
guidelines
that
were
followed
in
indiana
with
a
different
result
so
far
as
the
democrats
are
concerned.
there
is
no
alternate
plan
that
follows
these
guidelines,
and
particularly
the
guideline
of
black
voters,
because...
and
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement
which
was
met
by
the
indiana
legislature.
when
my
colleague
mentioned
the
guidelines
to
the
court
today,
he
didn't
mention
anything
about
not
diluting
the
black
vote.
he
mentioned
crossing
county
lines,
and
if
you
read
his
brief
you
wouldn't
know
that
there
are
two
parties
in
indiana.
when
he
uses
the
term
"minority",
he
means
democrats
in
his
brief,
but
the
legislature
is
faced
with
a
real
problem.
we
must
deal
with
black
voters
fairly,
and
within
that
context
we
developed
a
plan,
and
no
plan
has
ever
been
presented
to
show
any
different
alternative
plan
with
the
same
guidelines
would
produce
a
different
and
more
beneficial--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--i
defend
them
the
same
way
that
they
were
defended
successfully
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
your
honor,
because
they
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
you've
got
people
that
lose
in
some
multi-member
districts
or
single-member
districts.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
these
multi-member
districts
have
been
in
indiana
for
centuries,
i
mean,
for
hundreds
of
years.
mr.
william
m.
evans
pardon?
mr.
william
m.
evans
no,
but
the
only
reason
those
were
changed
was
because
of
the
one-man,
one-vote
restrictions.
you
see,
if
the
democrats
had
put
on
a
plan
that
followed
the
one-man,
one-vote
and
followed
the
protected
black
vote,
and
had
less...
and
were
county-wide,
you'd
have
a
different
situation.
but
they
don't--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--i
would
say
that
there
are
a
lot
of--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--well,
i
will
say
on
the
record,
there
is
no
particular
justification
for
a
particular
district,
justice
white.
the
fact
is,
it
was
there
and
there
were
constitutional--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--no,
it
wasn't
the
same
but
it
was
the
same
in
the
sense
that
they'd
been
there
and
they
had
15
members
at
the
time.
mr.
william
m.
evans
i'd
say
there
is
some
testimony
of
governmental
purpose,
but
i
think,
being
frank,
what
happened--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--well,
there's
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
it's
easier
in
urban
areas
to
have
it
because
of
media,
of
one
media
source
to
have
the
voters
vote
for
several
different
representatives
in
the
same
district
in
the
house.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
point.
i
think
it's
quite
true
that
these
districts
were
there.
the
record
does
show,
when
it
came
time
to
do
the
redistricting
there
were
multi-member
districts.
there
were
single-member
districts.
and
the
legislature
left
those
districts
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
voters
or
the
representatives
unless
there
was
a
requirement
for
a
specific
change.
i
don't
think
the
record
is
any
more
specific.
i
know
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis
there
are
notes
as
to
some
of
the
rationale
for
multi-member
districts,
but
why
these
particular
districts
were
retained,
i
don't
think
the
record
is
specific
on
that.
mr.
william
m.
evans
well,
it
depends
on
where
you
start.
as
a
matter
of
redistricting
process,
justice
stevens,
if
you
start
in
marion
county
that's
probably
true.
but
in
this
case
the
legislators
started
in
a
different
part
of
the
state
and
as
they
got
down
to
marion
county
with
the
changes
back
and
forth,
it
just
doesn't
fit
in
that
neat
a
package.
also,
in
a
sense
it's
helpful
to
the
democrats
because
it
gives
marion
county,
the
urban
area,
15
seats
where
they
might
otherwise
only
have
had
14.
i
think
that's
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
legislature,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--i
would
say
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think,
following
the
guidelines
of
this
court
as
were
done
would
justify
it,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
evans
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that
that
would
be,
in
and
of
itself,
a
rational
basis.
but
as
i
said--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--that
isn't
before
the
court
in
this
case.
as
i
say,
there's
no
plan
that
does
everything
the
legislature
wanted
to
do
and
gives
the
democrats
more
seats.
there
is
no
such
plan.
they
had
plenty
of
time
to
develop
such
a
plan
based
upon
the
facts,
and
that
hasn't
been
done.
mr.
william
m.
evans
yes,
there
would
be,
your
honor,
because
this
wasn't
just
a
plan
worked
out
just
by
the
republicans.
they
went
through
the
legislative
process.
all
the
rules
were
followed.
this
argument
about
due
process,
i
suggest,
is
a
make-weight
argument
and
as
presented,
perhaps
is
justification--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--because
the
plan
should
be
made
by
the
representatives...
the
citizens
through
their
representatives.
that
hasn't
been
done
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
a
computer
was
used
certainly
can't
be
of
concern
to
the
court
because
the
democrats
had
every
opportunity
to
develop
another
plan
with
the
same
criteria
with
less
impact
in
their
party
if
they
cared
to
do
so,
and
this
was
done
in
accordance
with
all
the
procedures
and
processes
of
the
indiana
general
assembly.
mr.
william
m.
evans
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
right
to
have
it
done
outside
of
the
normal
electoral
process.
mr.
william
m.
evans
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
statement
that--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--the
plan?
they
said...
they
made
a
statement
that
some
of
the
leaders
intended
to
try
to
continue
their
control
but
they
didn't
say
as
a
finding
if
that
was
done.
they
invalidated
the
plan,
basically
upon
a
seat
vote
ratio,
and
what
they
said
was
that
there
are
so
many
percent
of
votes
that
were
democrat
votes
in
the
house
and
so
many
seats.
that,
i
think,
is
the
main
basis
for
their
doing
it.
but,
i
think
a
proper
test
in
that
regard,
you
should
only
consider...
the
court
should
only
consider
contested
seats.
there
are
a
lot
of
unopposed
seats
in
their
ratio,
which
is
an
improper
assumption.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
this
record
if
you
take
the
vote
for
the
contested
races
for
the
house
of
1982,
you
find
republicans
had
a
majority
in
the
house,
democrats
had
a
majority
in
the
senate,
and
in
both
cases
the
party
that
got
a
majority
of
the
votes
for
contested
races
won
a
majority
of
the
seats,
which
meets
one
of
the
tests
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
william
m.
evans
it
is
a
consideration,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
a
minor
consideration.
i
believe
the
statement
was
made
in
the
record
that
if
the
numbers
fit,
they
would
consider
that
point.
but
the
key
questions
are
one-man,
one-vote,
preserving
the
black
vote,
and...
were
the
two
main
considerations.
no
dispute
that
those
governed
the
indiana
general
assembly
when
it
passed--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--well...
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
it's
a
factor
but
it
also
said,
it
must
give
way
to
other
considerations.
it
realized
it
wasn't
top
priority?
mr.
william
m.
evans
it
mentioned
it,
though.
mr.
william
m.
evans
it
said
that,
but
what
are
you
comparing
that
with,
your
honor?
again,
you
see
there
is
no
plan
that
gives
more
weight
to
community
of
interest
and
meets
the
guidelines
which
are
accepted
and
approved
by
this
court
as
carried
out
in
the
plan
itself.
we're
comparing
apples
and--
mr.
william
m.
evans
--that's
my
point.
there
are
no
other
plans
presented
to
compare
with
the
legislative
reapportionment
acts
themselves.
that,
i
think,
is
a
fatal
defect
in
the
case.
before
you
get
into
this
quagmire
of
political...
political
thicket,
at
least
they
should
have
put
something
before
the
court,
to
see
clearly
that
there
was
some
other
way
to
do
it
with
less
damage
to
the
democrats.
thank
you
very
much.
