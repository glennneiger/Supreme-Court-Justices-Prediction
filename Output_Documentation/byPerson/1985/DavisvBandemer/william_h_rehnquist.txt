justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
say
it's
not
justiciable,
that
means
that
even
the
most
extreme
example
of
gerrymandering
would
not
be
subject
to
any
judicial
review?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
conform
perfectly
to
one-man,
one-vote
or
one-person,
one-vote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
satisfactory
for
state
districts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
be
no
happier,
however,
if
it
were
zero
percent
deviation
and
still
came
out
with
this
sort
of
gerrymander?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
uphold
your
claim
in
this
case
and
say
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
neutral
objective,
and
so
it
goes
back
to
the
indiana
legislature,
and
this
time
they
say,
the
republican
majority
says,
we
can
still
get
the
democrats
and
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do,
but
we
will
kind
of
preserve
county
lines
in
most
of
them.
now,
would
that
eliminate
your
claim,
or
would
you
still
have
the
claim
even
though
there
was
some
neutral
factor
they
could
point
to,
if
their
intent
was
simply
to
get
as
much
for
the
republicans
as
they
could,
and
that
preserving
county
lines
was
just
a
kind
of
a
gimmick?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
said,
in
response
to
justice
brennan's
question,
you
were
going
to
say
something
about...
i
would
be
interested
to
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
certainly
different
from
the
holding
in
baker
against
carr
in
that
each
of
these
people's
vote
is
going
to
be
counted
the
same
way
in
the
ballot
box?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
the
population
erratic
districts,
the
votes
counted
for
less
in
the
districts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
one-person,
one-vote
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
should
that
encourage
us
to
push
the
doctrine
of
baker
against
carr
beyond
where
it
is
now
applicable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
most
fair
thing
in
your
view?
is
it
straight
proportional
representation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
something
is
unfair,
it
suggests
a
standard
of
fairness.
now,
just
what
would
be
the
most
fair
thing
to
have
done
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
the
indiana
legislature
decides,
we
want
to
break
city
lines.
we
want
to
break
county
lines.
