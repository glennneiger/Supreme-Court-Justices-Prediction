well,
no,
mr.
evans,
the
line
you
are
drawing
is
one
between
partisan
gerrymandering
and
racial
gerrymandering,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
question
of
justiciability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
partisan
gerrymandering,
you
say,
is
non-justiciable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
racial
gerrymandering
is
justiciable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
boehm,
if
this
were
a
non-justiciable...
that
is,
if
partisan
gerrymandering
is
non-justiciable,
i
guess
we
do
not
have
to
address
some
of
these
questions,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
address
justiciability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
boehm,
if
your
view
prevails,
do
you
suppose
it
will
make
much
work
for
the
judiciary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering,
at
least
in
cases
where
the
redistricting
is
done
by
a
partisan
majority,
whether
republican
or
democrat,
whether
the
other
party
isn't
going
to
run
right
to
court
and
challenge
the
redistricting,
and
with
all
that
that
entails.
