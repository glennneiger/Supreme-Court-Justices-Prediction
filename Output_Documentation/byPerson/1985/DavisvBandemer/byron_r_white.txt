justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
one
of
your
major
points
was
that
we
shouldn't
review
this
case
at
all,
or
the
merits;
we
should
say
it
is
not
justiciable.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
sound
to
me
like
if
you
are
citing
the
multi-member
district
case,
and
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
talk
about
gaffney--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
are
you
still
pressing
us
to
say
that
this
issue
is
not
justiciable?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
much
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
you
are
making
an
argument,
assuming
it
is
justiciable,
you
do
not
think
there
was
an
unconstitutional
gerrymander
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
gaffney?
that
was
not
a
racial
gerrymander.
that
was
a
partisan
gerrymander.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
we
reviewed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
theory,
it
seems
to
me
that
almost
any
time
a
reapportionment
or
redistricting
by
a
state
legislature
occurred
and
the
result
was
not
close
to
perfect
proportional
representation,
that
there
would
be
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
everybody
knows
who
is
districting,
knows
exactly
what
the
political
consequences
are
going
to
be
of
any
set
of
districts
that
are
drawn.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
they
know
that
if
this
particular
set
of
districts
downgrades
the
democrats
or
downgrades
the
republicans,
that
that
is
going
to
be
the
result,
and
they
thoroughly
intend
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
much
of
a
deviation
would
you
allow?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
ends
up
with
the
democrats
not
getting
what,
arguably,
what
they
desire,
what
they
are
entitled
to
vote-wise.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
justification
could
there
be
to
give
the
democrats
fewer
seats
than
they
are
entitled
to
in
terms
of
their
voting
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
they
articulated
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
prior
districting
in
indiana
had
been
done
by
a
democratic
legislature
and
they
had
gerrymandered
it
in
their
favor,
and
now
comes
along
a
republican
legislature
and
they
decide
to
do
exactly
what
was
done
in
gaffney,
try
to
get
proportional
representation,
so
their
purpose
has
to
be...
is
to
cut
down
the
democrats.
now,
would
that
be
a
legitimate
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say,
then,
that
the
first
step
in
attacking
a
plan
like
this
is,
you
have
got
to
prove
intent,
or
do
you
prove
intent
from
just
the
consequences,
or
both:
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
may
be,
but
in
theory
do
you
think
you
have
to
prove
intent
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
clerks
of
court
are
always
anonymous.
[laughter]
what
would
you
say
about
a
state
that
consistently
has
two
senators
of
one
party
but
a
two-to-one
minority
or
balance
the
other
way
on
the
house
members?
would
you
say
that
is
objective
evidence
that
somebody
has
been
playing
games
with
the
lines
of
the
congressional
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
gaffney
say
about
it?
wasn't
that
a
political
gerrymander?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
justiciability
at
issue
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
did
you
read
the
briefs
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
was,
was
justiciability
put
at
issue
in
the
briefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
always
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
it
also
discriminates
against
democrats,
but
that
is
just
incidental.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
insist
that
the
legislature
leave
those
kind
of
tracks
behind
them,
or
would
you
take...
accept
an
argument
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
as
to
what
is
a
defensible
reason
for
this
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
multi-member
districts?
how
do
you
defend
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
these
same
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
these
same
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
only
answer
to
the
multi-member
districts,
is
it,
well,
we've
always
had
multi-member
districts
somehow,
someplace
in
indiana?
is
that
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--let's
get
right
around
the
specific
reason.
take
one
of
your
multi-member
districts
and
give
me
your...
what
your
justification
is
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
really
wasn't...
it's
not
the
same
multi-member
district,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
you
can't
find
in
the
record
any
justification
for
any
specific
multi-member
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
for
a
multi-member
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
district
court
find
that
the
only
reason
for
this
plan
was
to
minimize
the
democratic
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they...
on
what
ground
did
they
invalidate
this?
