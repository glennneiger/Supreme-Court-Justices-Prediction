well,
mr.
evans,
is
it
correct,
if
you
look
at
marion
county,
the
history
was
as
multi-member
district
for
the
entire
county,
and
then
with
the
population
change
14
representatives
would
have
satisfied
that
county.
what
is
the
reason
for
it
making
a
15th
member
in
marion
county?
does
the
record
give
any
indication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
get
over
the
hurdle
of
justiciability,
if
your
opponent
does,
would
you
agree
that
there
must
be
a
rational
basis
for
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
say
there
must
be
a
rational
basis,
would
you
say
that
the
desire
to
maximize
the
political
strength
of
the
majority
party
is
a
rational
basis
within
that
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
there
would
have
to
be
some
other
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
the
case
be
different
if
the
majority
of
the
legislature
adopted
a
statute
saying,
we
will
not
entertain
any
democratic
plan
and
we
will
refer
the
districting
job
to
the
republican
state
committee
which
apparently
hired
the
computer
firm
here,
would
there
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
the
suggestion
i
made
to
you,
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
suggestion,
if
your
view
of
the
law
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
republican
party
to
prepare
the
plan
and
the
legislators
say,
well,
we've
taken
a
lock
at
it
and
it
looks
okay
to
us,
and
adopt
it.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
