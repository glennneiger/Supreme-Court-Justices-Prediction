mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
begin
by
correcting
what
we
believe
to
be
a
few
factual
misapprehensions
that
the
court
may
have
gained
in
the
course
of
the
presentation
this
morning.
there
were
indeed
alternative
maps
presented
to
the
general
assembly,
both
in
the
session
during
which
these
laws
were
enacted
and
in
subsequent
sessions.
however,
the
court
will
not
be
startled
to
learn
that
they
never
saw
the
light
of
day.
an
example
appears
as
exhibit
48
in
the
record.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
that
what
this
underlines
is
that
there
is
no
remedy
within
the
legislature
for
the
wrong
of
which
we
are
complaining,
and
that
it
is
and
was
a
useless
act
to
present
to
the
fox
a
correction
of
the
chicken
coop
guardian
situation.
the
competitive
districts
to
which
mr.
evans
referred
are
by
his
measure
competitive
in
the
sense
that
if
an
additional
15
or
so
percent
of
the
statewide
candidates
on
the
democratic
ticket
had
run
an
additional
ten
percent
ahead
of
the
top
of
the
democratic
ticket,
it
would
have
been
possible
to
gain
control
of
the
state
legislature.
that's
what
the
bottom
line
of
that
"competitive"
as
he
uses
it
is.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
mr.
evans'
statistics
are
done
manually,
your
honor.
what
he
did
is,
took
the
top
of
the
democratic
statewide
ticket
and
created
a
chart
that
was
not
an
exhibit
in
the
case,
was
not
introduced
in
evidence,
and
is
a
summary,
though,
of
data
that
is
in
the
record.
it
is,
we
submit,
a
manipulation
of
the
data
but
even
on
that
manipulated
data
it
demonstrates
that
the
high-waters
mark
for
the
democrats
doesn't
do
the
job
on
this
map,
and
that
even
if
the
democrats
have
a
substantial
majority
of
the
votes
they
cannot
gain
a
majority
of
the
seats
under
foreseeable
election
returns.
finally,
on
the
comment
about
multi-member
districts,
it
is
correct
in
one
sense
that
indiana
has
historically
had
multi-member
districts.
however,
from
the
constitution
of
1851
forward
through
the
districts
involved
in
whitcomb
against
chavis
with
which
this
court
dealt,
those
multi-member
districts
were
counties.
the
legislature
was
apportioned
among
the
counties,
which
is
the
basic
unit
of
government
in
indiana,
and
by
1971
fifteen,
for
example,
were
apportioned
to
marion
county
which
is
the
city
of
indianapolis.
that
scheme
is
not
what
is
involved
here.
those
were
multi-member
districts,
but
there
was
no
showing
and
there
was
no
contention,
and
it
was
not
true
that
those
multi-member
districts
were
done
for
invidious
discriminatory
purposes.
they
simply
were
an
effort
to
allocate
representation
among
the
counties
and
they
respected
the
historical
practice
of
attempting
to
give
counties
representation
within
the
state
government,
a
perfectly
legitimate
objective
of
state
government.
the
multi-member
districts
that
we
are
attacking
here
today
bear
no
relationship
to
anything
other
than
the
objective
of
maximizing
the
preservation
of
the
transient
majority's
control
of
the
state
legislature.
they
are
fundamentally,
qualitatively
different
types
of
districts.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
within
two
percent,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
we
submit
it
is
satisfactory
if
justified.
the
whole
theory
of
permitting
greater
deviations
from
perfect
populations
stemming
from
the
early
cases,
mahan
versus
howell
if
that
is
how
you
pronounce
it,
in
'64
and
forward
in
virginia
allows
the
greater
population
deviations
because
the
state
may
properly
conclude
that
it
wishes
to
recognize,
for
example,
cities,
towns,
counties,
other
legitimate
objectives.
here
they
took
the
population
deviation
but
didn't
carry
with
it
the
burden
of
honoring
all
these
other
proper
objectives.
they
discarded
all
the
proper
objectives
and
just
took
an
arbitrary
two
percent
benchmark.
the
point
is
simply,
the
justification
for
population
deviations
is
wholly
lacking
in
this
map,
so
we
submit
it
analytically
should
fail
under
the
population
test
as
well
because
the
reasons
for
the
population--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
sir,
we
want
to
be
absolutely--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
correct
your.
honor.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
there
are
several
ways
you
can
have
a
perfectly
constitutional,
plan,
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
we
do
not
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
any
specific
number
of
seats
in
the
general
assembly.
we
do
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
be
free
from
a
statute
that
arbitrarily,
that
is
to
say
without
justification
in
any
proper
governmental
purpose,
harms
us.
that
is
a
fundamental
equal
protection
doctrine,
any
classification
of
citizens.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
several
things
could
do
it,
and
they
have
been
iterated
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
adherence
to
county
lines,
recognition--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--they
were,
by
the
district
court,
your
honor.
yes,
and
the
district
court
uniformly
found
that
none
of
these
proper
justifications
was
present
in
this
case
including
specifically
a
finding
that
the
claim
that
these
maps
were
somehow
designed
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
black
vote,
was
fanciful.
there
is
simply
no
showing
in
this
record
that
this
map
was
required
by
any
desire
to
prevent
a
degradation
of
the
black
vote,
and
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
that
contention.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
preserving
county
lines
is
one
restriction,
your
honor,
just
like
population
equality
is
a
restriction,
just
like
the
requirement
that
if
they're
going
to
have
different
sized
districts,
in
other
words
some
multi,
some
single
different
sized
multis,
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
it,
a
proper
governmental
reason
which
there
was
in
whitcomb
against
chavis,
but
they
decided
marion
county
ought
to
get
15
seats.
now,
the
effect
of
that
scheme,
of
course,
was
not
to
discriminate
against
one
party
or
another,
because
whichever
party
then
carried
marion
county
carried
all
15
seats
and
had
reasonable
access
to
the
control
of
the
legislature.
here
they
took
the
very
same
body
politic,
marion
county
which
previously
had
15
seats
under
the
'70
census,
discovered
that
it
had
only
14...
and
by
the
way,
coincidentally,
a
perfect
14...
it
could
have
been
carved
up
into
14
single
member
districts
perfectly.
but,
in
order
to
preserve
its
15
seats
in
the
legislature
they
took
marion
county,
patched
on
areas
from
three
continguous
counties,
to
create
five
three-member
districts
out
of
an
area
that
is
essentially
47-53
republican.
now,
having
done
that,
they
took
the
hole
of
that
doughnut
and
gave
it
three
seats.
the
hole
in
that
doughnut
is
approximately
90
percent
democratic.
the
rest
of
the
democratic
vote
is
by
and
large
on
the
periphery
of
the
hole,
and
it
was
carved
up
into
four
separate
parts,
each
of
which
was
then
subjected
to
additional
votes
from
suburban
and
exurban
areas.
result,
twelve
to
three
cut
of
an
area
that
is
57
to
three,
with
no
legitimate
governmental
purpose
being
served
by
this
scheme.
in
ft.
wayne,
indiana,
something
very
similar
happened
but
with
even
more
effect.
there
the
city
is
a
city
consisting
of
170,000-odd
people.
it
is
entitled
on
any
sort
of
a
proportional
representation
to
three-plus
seats
in
the
indiana
house.
it
has
a
democratic
mayor.
yet,
neither
the
city
of
ft.
wayne
nor
allen
county
in
which
it
resides
became
a
district
or
an
area
that
was
carved
up
into
districts.
rather,
they
went
out
into
the
surrounding
areas,
took
farmland
and
patched
it
on
to
allen
county
to
create
two
three-member
districts,
a
total
of
six
people
elected
from
this
area,
split
the
city
of
ft.
wayne
right
down
the
middle,
and
produced
a
six-zero
republican
majority
cut
of
a
city
that
has
a
democratic
mayor
and
is
entitled
to
over
three
seats
itself.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
it
would
be
a
legitimate
reason.
if
their
purpose
is
to
achieve
a
fair
plan,
it's
perfectly
constitutional.
that
is
what
gaffney
holds,
and
we
embrace
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
think
in
this
case
we
have
got
an
easy
case
because
on
the
question
of...
there
are
two
questions
presented
by
this
case.
the
first
is--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--i
think
you
can
talk
about
it
as
intent
if
you
wish.
however,
i
think
intent
normally
should
be
proved
by
objective
criteria.
you
normally
judge
what
a
person
intends
to
do
by
what
he
does
and
what
the
consequences
of
his
acts
are.
that's
the
test
that
we
would
apply
here.
now,
in
this
case
we
have
the
remarkable
gift
of
a
confession.
they
essentially
said,
"we
did
it".
now,
that
is
pretty
good
evidence
that
they
did
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
the
threshold
question,
your
honor.
there
are
two
questions.
one
of
them
is,
is
it
justiciable,
and
the
other
one
is,
did
they
do
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
certainly
am,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
none,
other
than,
we
have
the
census
of
1980
which
is
obviously
different
from
the
'70
census
that
was
the
predicate
of
the
previous
plan.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
your
honor,
and
we
would
agree
that
it
may
be
a
validation
of
a
deviation
from
a
legitimate
plan
if
there
were
a
showing
that
for
perfectly
good
reasons
we
have
identified
that
this
area
is
likely
to
be
bigger
in
1982
than
it
was
in
1980
so
we're
going
to
tip
it
a
little
bit,
and
besides
it
is
a
city.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
of
that
sort,
and
we
submit
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
come
up
with
what
is
on
its
face,
and
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
a
totally
arbitrary
plan,
then
the
state
has
to
come
forward
with
that
evidence.
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
say,
oh,
we
took
into
account
population
shifts.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record
on
that
point,
and
if
there
were
we
would
have
a
different
case,
but
we
do
not.
to
return
to
the
intent
point,
though,
justice
white,
we
submit
that
on
this
record
we
proved
that
they
intended
it
because
they
said
that
is
what
they
intended
to
do,
but
we
also
proved
it
by
a
separate
set
of
evidence
that
is
of
more
general
interest.
there
is
no
point
in
having
an
intent
test
that
is
satisfied
only
by
the
sort
of
subjective
evidence
we
have
here.
there
is
no
point
in
having
state
legislators
jump
through
all
the
proper
hoops,
say
all
the
proper
things,
and
then
come
up
with
an
arbitrary,
capricious
and
discriminatory
map.
that
is
not
what
we
are
contending.
we
contend
that
you
judge
a
map
not
by
hindsight,
and
in
this
respect
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
district
court
that
the
primary
test
is
not
now
many
seats
were
in
fact
elected,
but
what
does
the
map
look
like
on
the
basis
of
the
data
that
is
available
as
of
the
time
this
map
was
drawn,
and
that
data
is
in
the
court,
before
the
court,
in
the
form
of
exhibit
36
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
shows
how
on
data
that
was
agreed
by
every
expert
to
be
the
most
reliable
measure
of
a
party's
strength,
how
these
districts
actually
shape
up,
and
it
shows
that
62
percent
of
the
house
districts
are
weighted
in
favor
of
the
republicans
and
38
percent
are
weighted
in
favor
of
the
democrats
on
a
50
percent
vote.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
50-50
statewide
vote,
which
we
happen
to
have
as
a
result
of
the
anonymous
races
statewide,
things
like
the
clerk
of
the
courts
are
elected
in
indiana
and
as
everybody
can
see,
nobody
really
runs
as
an
individual
for
offices
like
that.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no,
sir,
i
would
not,
on
the
face
of
it,
draw
any
conclusion
from
that.
i
need
to
look
at
other
baseline
data
to
have
any
opinion
on
that
subject.
it
could
well
happen
that
the
senators
are
just
great
senators
and
as
everybody
in
this
courtroom
knows,
the
higher
profile
the
office,
the
more
possible
it
is
for
an
individual
to
run
well
ahead
or
well
behind
his
or
her
party's
baseline
vote.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
think
it
is
correct,
that
he
does
not
have
as
much.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
that
is
correct,
at
least
in
indiana.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
am
sure
they
would
not,
they
are
a
coequal
branch.
but
even
if
they
are
of
equal
profile--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--assuming
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
our
purposes
the
point
is
that
a
difference
between
the
congressional
representative
seats
and
the
senate,
u.s.
senate
seats,
we
could
reflect
the
profile
of
both
players.
in
other
words
both
the
representatives
and
the
u.s.
senators,
could
run
well
ahead
or
behind
of
their
respective
party's
strengths
for
reasons
that
are
unique
to
them,
and
without
regard
to
whether...
as
between
the
two
of
them
they
are
stronger
or
weaker.
it
is
just
that
each
of
them
are
able
to
carve
out
for
themselves
a
distinctive
position
and
do
not
necessarily
run
along
party
lines.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
in
the
state
map
there
is
very
little
basis
for
that,
but
again
the
test
is
not,
does
a
given
candidate
win
or
lose.
that
candidate
may
win
or
lose,
and
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
that
it
does
indeed
happen,
by
running
significantly
ahead
of
his
party's
strength.
but
the
point
is,
you
have
got
a
statute
of
a
state
that
is
designed
to
and
does
handicap
a
group
severely.
the
fact
that
the
horse
with
the
50-pound
weight
might
actually
end
up
winning
the
race,
versus
the
unhandicapped
horse,
doesn't
mean
it's
a
fair
race.
it
simply
means
that
that
horse
was
that
much
stronger,
and
that
does
happen.
the
point
is,
there
is
a
significant...
not
just
significant
but
virtually
insuperable
handicap
imposed
by
this
map
on
democrats
as
a
group
to
no
legitimate
governmental
end
whatever,
and
part
of
it,
of
course,
is
simply
the
classification
of
districts.
here
we
have
something
that
does
not
occur
at
all
in
the
congressional
map,
and
that
is,
multi-member
districts
are
used
in
conjunction
with
single
member
districts
for
the
sole
and
explicit
reason
of
coming
up
with
more
republicans,
and
the
proof
of
that
pudding
is
in
the
eating.
look
at
those
three-member
districts.
ft.
wayne
has
two
of
them.
indianapolis
has
five
of
them.
together
they
elect
18
republicans
and
three
democrats
cut
of
an
area
that
is
54
percent
one
party,
46
and
a
fraction
another.
on
any
reasonable
map,
those
21
percent
of
the
legislature
should
be
something
like
eight-seven
one
way
or
the
other,
nine-six
at
the
worst,
but
they
are
12
to
three,
and
the
way
it
is
done
is
purely,
simply
and
arbitrarily
classifying
one
group
of
voters
at
the
expense
of
another.
that,
of
course--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--yes,
sir.
on
the
justiciability
point,
first
and
foremost
our
proposition
is
that
justiciability
of
this
case
is
evident
from
baker
and
carr
itself,
that
this
case
is
capable
of
being
analyzed
in
traditional
equal
protection
terms.
there
is
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
that
limits
its
application
to
a
group
defined
by
race.
indeed,
our
brief
and
that
filed
by
common
cause,
submit
a
series
of
cases
in
which
other
definitions
of
a
target
group
are
held
to
be
equal
protection
violations.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes.
gaffney
came
out
that
it
was
constitutional
because
it
was
not
a
discriminatory
plan.
it
does
not
mean
it
is
not
justiciable.
it
simply
means
it
is
okay,
what
they
did
in
connecticut
in
1970.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
implicitly.
i
always
hesitate
to
tell
the
person
who
wrote
the
opinion
what
it
means.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
have
not
recently,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
certainly
was
at
least
implicitly
put
at
issue
in
the
fact
that
the
court
dealt
with
the
question
and
resolved
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
in
any
event,
baker
and
carr,
we
submit,
does
deal
with
the
question
at
length
and
says
what
is
and
is
not
justiciable,
and
it
holds
that
a
matter
is
justiciable
unless
it
falls
into
the
area
reserved
to
another
co-equal
branch
of
the
federal
government,
which
this
plainly
does
not.
you
are
simply
adjudicating
the
validity
of
a
statute
of
a
state,
the
sort
of
thing
this
court
does
all
the
time,
and
it
is
analyzable
in
very
traditional
equal
protection
terms.
is
the
statute
a
classification
of
citizens?
the
answer
is
plainly
yes.
it
puts
people
in
different
parts
of
the
state
in
different
categories.
it
is
aimed
at
a
category
of
citizens,
in
this
case
those
aligned
with
the
democratic
party
and
it
does
in
fact
very
severely
harm
them.
that
is
what
the
equal
protection
clause
says
cannot
be
done.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
you
need
to
realize,
you
need
to
focus
on
the
impact
of
the
plan
as
a
whole
here.
does
the
plan
as
a
whole
disadvantage
one
group
or
another?
any
individual,
of
course,
gets
his
or
her
vote
counted
and
that
happens
in
a
map
that
is
population
erratic
or
a
map
that
has
districts
like
we
have.
the
question,
though,
ultimately
boils
down
to--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--the
votes
of
democrats
count
for
less
in
indiana
in
general.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
qualitatively
identical,
quantitatively,
technically,
mechanically
different.
the
result
is
identical.
the
equal
population
gerrymander,
as
it
has
come
to
be
called,
is
a
well-known
phenomenon
and
anybody
with
the
time
and
the
computer
technology
in
1980
can
draw
a
map,
and
a
good
example
is
presented
in
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
republican
national
committee
in
which
they
took
the
very
same
election
results
for
marion
county,
indiana
that
produced
12
to
3
republican
and
drew
a
map
that
shows
11
to
4
democrat
within
a
republican
unit.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
on
the
question
of
justiciability,
baker
and
carr,
we
submit,
does
not
require
any
pushing.
it
already
gives
you
the
doctrinal
framework
that
leads
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
justiciable.
it
does
not
involve
another
co-equal
branch
of
government.
it
is
resolvable
in
equal
protection
terms,
and
indeed
this
court
has
repeatedly,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
multi-member
district
aspect
of
it,
said
that
racial
or
political
groups,
if
the
subject
is
invidious
discrimination,
may
present
constitutional
claims.
so,
there
is
nothing
novel
about
that,
at
least
in
the
context
of
multi-member
groups.
now,
the
question
whether
it
is
justiciable,
once
you
are
there,
then
the
question
is
what
is
the
standards.
how
do
you
identify
whether
this
matter
is
or
isn't
constitutional?
i
submit
that
justice
stevens
in
karcher
has
given
us
a
framework
within
which
to
analyze
that,
and
you
can
go
at
it
either
way.
you
can
attack
it
along
the
subjective
intent
lines.
i
submit
that
the
objective
evidence
of
intent
is
the
proper
way
for
the
court
to
analyze
it,
because
it
then
gives
the
map-makers
themselves
confidence
that
they
can
draw
a
constitutional
map.
they
have
the
data
available
to
them
at
the
time
they
draw
it,
and
there
are
several
ways
you
can
do
that.
one
of
them
is
what
was
done
in
gaffney,
a
procedural
remedy
whereby
you
place
the
drawing
of
a
map
in
the
hands
of
somebody
whose
motives
are
not
inherently
suspect,
and
unless
somebody
comes
up
with
something
that
is
really
bad
about
it,
it
is
presumptively
valid
and
i
would
submit
should
be
upheld.
the
other
way
to
go
about
it
is
to
do
what
we
attempted
to
demonstrate
in
the
district
court
and
that
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
maps
are
susceptible
of
analysis
in
terms
of
the
districts.
you
can
look
at
them
and
determine
exactly
whether
the
map
is
or
isn't
fair,
in
round
terms,
and
then
you
look
at
whether
it's
justified.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
no.
again,
we
are
not
advocating
proportional
representation.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
the
simplest...
well,
the
most
fair
thing
to
do,
we
submit,
is
to
have
an
arbitrary
checklist
of
objective
criteria,
that
you
go
down
until
you
come
to
the
map
that
meets
most
of
them.
for
example,
you
initially
look
at
the
equal
population
requirement
within
your
population
deviation,
whatever
the
legislature
sets.
second,
how
few
county
lines
does
it
break?
third,
how
few
city
lines
does
it
break?
fourth,
how
compact
are
they?
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
then
let
it
say
so,
and
why.
if
it
has
a
legitimate
objective,
it
can
say
so
in
its
preamble
or
in
its
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
of
this
is,
it
is
designed
to
disadvantage
democrats.
now,
if
somebody
says,
we
want
to
have
a
map
that
gives
representation
to
farmers
because
we
think
they
are
a
group
that
has
interests,
or
we
want
to
have
a
map
that
recognizes
any
other
legitimate
proffer--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--if
they
can
do
it
for
legitimate
reasons,
i
submit
they
can
do
it.
if
they
can
draw
a
map
within
the
proper
lines
and
relying
on
recognizable,
legitimate
governmental
objectives,
then
they
also
can
play
a
few
games
within
those
parameters.
but
you
have
accomplished
a
very
great
deal.
on
the
map
here
in
indiana,
you
would
at
a
minimum
gain
several
seats
for
the
democrats
simply
by
breaking
up
these
multi-member
districts
which
are
the
most
egregious
abuse
in
this
thing.
the
other
egregious
abuses
require
a
familiarity
that
the
district
court
had
with
the
map
of
indiana.
when
you
look
at
the
maps
they
don't
look
particularly
odd
because
indiana
is,
after
all,
laid
out
in
township
and
range.
everything
is
square
in
indiana,
and
the
minimal
voting
unit
in
some
parts
of
the
state
is
the
township.
so,
you
end
up
with
something
that
doesn't
on
its
face
look
too
strange,
but
if
you
look
at
senate
district
39
that
pairs
downtown
terre
haute
with
coal
mines
three
counties
south,
that
is
very
peculiar
from
any
reasonable
objective,
and
the
district
court
went
through
this
analysis,
made
its
findings
of
fact
which
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
they
are
clearly
correct.
this
map
enjoys
no
rational
basis
whatever.
it
is
purely
and
simply
an
effort
to
perpetuate
a
transient
majority.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
yes,
we
would.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
with
respect
to
the
blacks,
of
course
there
is
the
voting
rights
aspect
that
justice
o'connor's
question
raised.
there
was
a
voting
rights
act
claim
raised
in
the
parallel
case
filed
by
the
naacp.
my
clients
did
not
assert
a
voting
rights
act
claim
for
the
obvious
reason
that
a
majority
of
them
are
white,
and
some
parts
of
the
state
that
are
horribly
gerrymandered
do
not
have
a
great
voting
rights
act
case.
other
parts
do.
the
district
court
held
that
it
didn't
find
the
requisite
intent
that
it
believed
under
the
382
version
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
required,
and
therefore
didn't
reach
that
issue,
but
i
submit
you
would
find
under
the
'82
act,
a
voting
rights
act
violation
if
you
looked
at
the
facts
and
the
law
as
it
now
sits,
but
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
by
reason
of
our
not
having
presented
it
and
then
naacp's
not
having
appealed
it.
that
is
explained
in
the
naacp--
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
--your
honor,
you
are
well
familiar
with
flood-of-litigation
arguments.
we
submit
that
baker
and
carr
is
to
the
first
wave
of
reapportionment
what
this
may
well
be
to
the
second.
there
will
no
doubt
be
a
time
of
adjustment,
but
by
and
large
the
state
legislatures
were
very
capable
of
adapting
to
the
one-man,
one-vote
rule.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
well,
there
will
undoubtedly
be
some
of
that,
justice
brennan,
but
i
submit
that
if
you
follow
the
proper
analysis
which
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself,
and
under
well
established
doctrines
within
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state
if
it
is
going
to
classify
has
to
come
up
with
a
rational
explanation
for
its
classification,
and
that
there
are
objective
quantifiable
ways
to
look
at
these
maps
including
simply
mechanical
tests,
equal
population,
number
of
districts
divided,
number
of
cities
and
towns
divided.
and,
if
the
state
wants
to
deviate
from
those,
that's
fine
but
it
needs
to
explain
why
it's
doing
that,
particularly,
of
course,
if
you
have
a
one-party
plan
as
you
have
here
where
the
legislature
in
both
houses
and
the
governor
who
signs
it
are
all
in
the
same
party.
it's
inherently
suspect.
mr.
theodore
r.
boehm
how
you
prove
it
is
the
question
that
we
haven't
thought
through
fully.
if
i
were
drawing
a
map,
justice
white,
i
would
put
in
the
preamble
why
we've
done
what
we've
done.
i'm
not
accorded
that
privilege
in
indiana
and
won't
be
unless
this
court
affirms
the
district
court's
decision,
but
in...
you
could,
of
course
prove
it
any
way
you
could
legitimately
prove
it,
i
would
think.
by
the
way...
i'm
sorry.
