mr.
evans,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
mr.
evans,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
boehm.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
come
to
be?
is
that
done
by
computers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
come
to
that,
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
about
the
impact
of
the
mobility
of
population
in
periods
of
one
year
or
two
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
cases
which
have
shown
conclusively
that
between
the
time
the
plan
is
enacted
and
the
time
it
is
carried
cut
in
an
election,
the
mobility
of
people
has
altered
the
validity
of
the
plan.
would
you
suggest
there
is
nothing
like
that
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
congressional
district,
do
you
suggest
that
a
house
member
doesn't
have
as
much
profile
as
a
senator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
so
sure
the
house
members
would
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
seriously,
the
senators
have
fallen
quite
far
away.
the
house
members
are
down
there
dealing
with
local
problems,
whether
it
is
a
farm
district
or
a
manufacturing
district
or
whatever.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
perhaps
inadvertently
you
would
have
put
your
finger
on
the
problem
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
that
the
voters
will
vote
one
way
in
the
house
and
vote
another
way
in
the
senate
and
vice
versa,
in
the
different
elections--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
time
is
it?
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
