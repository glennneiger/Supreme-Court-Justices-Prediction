mr.
roderick
k.
daane
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit,
which
concluded
that
the
university
of
michigan
had
treated
the
respondent
unconstitutionally
when
it
denied
him
two
chances
to
take
a
test
that
he
had
flunked
in
the
university's
medical
school.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
shall
assume
the
existence
of
a
constitutionally
protectable
property
right
in
respondent's
continued
enrollment
in
the
university's
medical
school
while
on
what
might
be
termed
good
academic
behavior.
i
shall
argue
that
the
sixth
circuit
erred
in
its
decision
that
the
university
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
deprived
mr.
ewing--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--because,
justice
powell--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--i
just
assume
it
as
the
court
did
in
horowitz
because
i
believe
it
is
not
essential
to
reach
that
issue
in
order
to
decide
this
case
on
the
narrower
ground
of
whether
mr.
ewing
was
treated
by
the
university
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
way.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
am
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
the
existence
of
the
protectable
property
interest.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
most
certainly
not,
justice
white.
i
think
you
would
be
able
to
find
that
mr.
ewing
was
not
treated
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
way
and--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--then,
of
course,
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
affirm.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
must
say,
justice
white,
that
the
idea
of
arguing
the
property
interest
has
some
appeal
for
me
and
the
idea
that
there
should
not
be
a
property
interest
in
such
as
thing
as
a
course
grade
or
a
qualification,
an
academic
qualification.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
that
is
correct.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
clearly
it
is
within
the
parameters
of
the
question
as
framed
in
the
petition,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
agree.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes,
and
the
solicitor
general's
position,
justice
powell,
is,
as
i
said,
quite
attractive
to
me.
i
just
think
that
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
a
narrower
basis.
i
will
argue
the
property
interest
if
the
court
wishes.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
legitimate
question.
i
mean
to
suggest
only
that
i
believe
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
the
narrower
grounds
of
whether--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--very
well,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
the
understanding
that
they
have,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
proceed
in
the
program
while
they
are
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
medical
school's
faculty,
while
they
are
on
what
i
termed
a
minute
ago
good
academic
behavior.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
in
the
official
bulletins
of
the
medical
school,
justice
o'connor...
i
am
referring
now
to
exhibits
36
and
39,
which
are
the
two
bulletins
which
were
effective
at
the
time
mr.
ewing
matriculated
and
at
the
time
he
flunked
out...
there
are
clear
provisions
conferring
upon
the
promotion
board's
discretion
to
pass,
to
fail,
or
to
take
any
one
of
many
intermediate
actions
between
those
two
extremes
with
respect
to
the
enrolled
students,
yes.
i
would
like
to
review
quite
briefly
mr.
ewing's
record
at
michigan.
he
matriculated
in
the
fall
of
1975.
he
flunked
out
in
the
summer
of
'81.
while
he
was
with
us
he
accumulated
an
unenviable
academic
record
which
included
numerous
low
grades,
seven
incompletels,
two
terms
during
which
he
was
on
leaves
of
absence,
several
terms
during
which
he
was
on
an
irregular
or
reduced
course
load
schedule.
the
faculty
had
devoted
considerable
time
to
helping
him
along
at
the
point
which
was
reached
in
mid-summer
1980
when
they
warned
him
in
writing...
and
that
writing
appears
at
146
of
the
joint
appendix...
that
one
more
deficiency
would
be
cause
for
his
being
dropped
from
registration.
now,
that
deficiency
could
have
taken
the
form,
if
the
court
please,
of
a
failure
in
a
course
grade
or
a
failure
on
a
final
exam,
but
in
mr.
ewing's
case
it
took
the
form
of
a
failure
on
the
national
board
of
medical
examiners,
part
i
exam.
this
is
a
two-day
exam
which
tests
students
in
seven
subject
matter
areas.
mr.
ewing
flunked
five
out
of
the
seven
with
the
egregiously
low
score
of
235
against
a
passing
standard
of
345
which
has
since
been
raised
to
380.
that
score
was
the
lowest
in
the
inteflex
program,
the
combined
baccalaureate
and
medical
school
program
in
which
respondent
was
enrolled
and
occasioned
concerned
on
the
part
of
the
faculty,
promotion
and
review
board,
which
met
the
following
month
to
review
his
record
and
determine
his
eligibility
to
continue.
that
meeting
took
place
on
july
24,
1981,
and
was
the
first
of
what
was
to
be
five
meetings
of
the
michigan
faculty
devoted
to
reviewing
mr.
ewing's
record.
there
were
two
promotion
board
meetings
and
three
meetings
of
the
medical
school's
executive
committee.
if
you
add
all
of
that
up,
you
will
find
that
over
two
dozen
senior
faculty
members
at
the
university
of
michigan's
medical
school
devoted
countless
hours
to
reviewing
mr.
ewing's
progress
through
the
medical
school
both
before
and
after.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
he
is
in
chicago,
i
am
informed
by
counsel,
enrolled
in
the
chicago
college
of
osteopathy,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
none
whatsoever.
the
faculty
reviews
were
unanimous
of
the
opinion
that
mr.
ewing
should
be
dropped
from
registration.
he
appealed
the
first
such
determination.
he
appeared
before
the
faculty's
promotion
and
review
board,
submitted
both
written
evidence
and
spoke
to
the
board
and
was
questioned
by
the
board.
significantly,
the
questions,
particularly
those
posed
by
dr.
friedman,
were
directed
to
the
point
that
mr.
ewing
was
well
aware
at
the
time
he
sat
for
the
examination
of
the
grave...
the
gravity
of
his
academic
condition
at
that
point.
dr.
friedman
also
testified,
by
the
way,
that
he
alone--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--certainly.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
well--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--the
legal
point
is
the
care
and
deliberation
which
went
into
the
decision
to
terminate.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
no,
they
didn't
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
they
over
did
what
they
were
required
to
do.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
it
goes
to
the
admonition
of
this
court
in
board
of
curators
v.
horowitz,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
careful
and
deliberate
decision
made
by
professional
decision
makers
such
as
those
on
michigan's
faculty
should
not
be
reviewed
by
the
courts.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes,
sir.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes,
we
have
argued
them
on
brief.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
hadn't
intended
to
today,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
would
rest
on
the
briefs,
yes.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes.
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
in
this
case
is
interesting
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
case
stands
at
the
intersection
of
the
eleventh
and
the
fourteenth.
there
really
are
very
few
federal
rights
implicated
by
the
complaint
mr.
ewing
makes
against
the
university
of
michigan.
he
asserts
in
essence
that
what
we
have
done
is
failed
to
follow
what
is
really
a
state
law
rule.
he
doesn't
assert
that
we
have
deprived
him
of
a
specific
federal
right
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights.
he
doesn't
say,
for
example,
that
his
dismissal
was
pretextual
in
any
way.
he
doesn't
allege
racial
or
any
other
sort
of
invidiousness
nor
could
he.
he
doesn't
allege
that
he
has
been
punished
for
the
exercise
of
a
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
privilege,
anything
of
that
kind.
what
he
argues
is
that
our
decision
makers
were
prevented
or
should
have
been
prevented
from
making
the
professional,
academic
decision
that
they
made
by
a
so-called
rule
which
automatically
entitled
him
to
take
two
cracks
at
passing
the
nbme
exam.
if
you
strip
the
bark
off
his
argument,
that
is
really
what
it
amounts
to.
he
is
complaining
about
the
decision
of
the
faculty
which
considered
him
to
be
an
unqualified
student,
unqualified
to
go
forward.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
we
did
not
file
a
response
to
that
motion,
justice
o'connor,
and
my
candid
opinion
is
that
it
really
doesn't
change
the
applicability
of
the
eleventh
amendment
defense,
because
the
motion--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--yes,
i
do,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
motion
does
not
seek
to
name
them
in
their
individual
capacities.
it
seeks
to
name
them
in
their
official
capacities,
and
seems
to
me
that
really
does
not
change
the
nature
of
the
case
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes
in
any
terribly
significant
way.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
respondent--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--respondent
appears
to
be
of
that
opinion.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
well,
i
think
it
is
very
late
in
the
day,
justice
marshall.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
we
did
not
oppose
it,
therefore--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--yes.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
hutto...
i
don't
mean
to
be
arguing
respondent's
case,
but
he
cited--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--yes,
your
honor.
hutto
v.
finney,
i
believe,
is
the
case
upon
which
respondent
relied.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
sorry.
i
think
it
is
brandon
v.
holt.
i
misspoke.
brandon
v.
holt,
469
u.s.,
justice
marshall,
is
the
case
upon
which
respondent's
argument
is
premised.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
that
is
it.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
an
eleventh
amendment
decision
made
by
the
district
court
which
concerned
the
respondent's
claim
for
damages
in
that
court
and
dismissed
count
three
of
the
complaint
on
the
basis
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
decision,
of
course,
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurst.
in
pennhurst,
when
the
court
decided
that
it
was
an
intolerable
intrusion
upon
state
sovereignty
for
federal
courts
to
order
states
to
conform
their
conduct
to
state
law,
it
changed
the
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
for
us
sort
of
mid-way
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argued
the
pennhurst
case
on
application
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
application
for
rehearing
was
denied.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
no,
i--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--i
do
not
waive
it,
justice
stevens.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
do
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue
is
of
critical
importance
to
the
higher
education
community
and
to
the
tradition
of
academic
freedom
in
this
country
which
this
court's
precedence
and
policy
have
upheld
for
many,
many
years,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
i
intend
to
address
with
the
court
this
morning.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
contention
on
the
part
of
respondent
that
the
university
failed
to
follow
its
own
rule
in
this
case
when
it
denied
him
a
second
chance
at
the
exam.
i
would
like
to
assure
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
university
of
michigan
failed
to
follow
its
own
rule.
in
the
first
place,
we
had
no
rule
automatically
entitling
a
student
to
a
retest.
each
retest
which
was
granted
was
granted
after
specific
action
of
the
promotion
and
review
board
authorizing
such
a
retest.
that
action
was
an
exercise
of
the
discretion
which
i
earlier
made
reference
to
in
the
university's
bulletins.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
challenge
the
way
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
expressed
it,
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
rather
call
it
a
consistent
result
than
a
consistent
practice.
but,
it
is
true
that
mr.
ewing
was
the
only
one
of
the
several
students
with
whom
he
compares
himself
who
was
not
afforded
the
opportunity
for
a
retest.
but,
that
result
came
about
as
a
product
of
the
specific
individual
review
by
the
promotion
board
in
each
case
of
the
eligibility
of
each
student
to
continue.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
they
were
considered
sufficiently
difficult
by
the
faculty,
justice
rehnquist,
yes.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
i
can't
answer
that
question
because
i
am
not
a
medical
educator,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
re-examinations
are
allowed
in
the
discretion
of
the
faculty
when
faculty
considers
it
appropriate
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
the
student's
potential,
the
student's
overall
record,
performance
in
the
courses
already
taken.
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
subjective
judgment
that
goes
into
those
decisions,
mr.
chief
justice,
and,
therefore,
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--certainly.
sometimes
they
are.
but,
again,
it
is
not
the
product
of
an
automatic
right.
that
is
the
point
i
wish
to
emphasize.
the
other
point
about
that
which
i
wish
to
emphasize
is
that
when
mr.
ewing
took
the
examination
for
the
first
time,
he
had
been
warned
and
he
understood
the
warning
that
he
had
received,
that
one
more
deficiency
would
be
cause
for
his
termination.
so,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
rule
in
this
case,
that
is
what
it
is,
one
more
deficiency
and
you
are
out.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
we
advised
him
of
the
earlier
warning
which
appears
at
144
in
which
it
says,
"the
board
also
specified
that
any
further
academic
deficiencies
will
lead
to
your
being
dropped
from
registration
in
the
inteflex
program.
"
i
haven't
said
anything
about
youngberg
v.
romeo
and
my
time
is
approaching
its
end.
youngberg
is
an
important
precedent
for
this
case.
in
youngberg,
this
court
held
that
a
professional
decision
made
by
professional
decision-makers
should
not
be
overturned
by
courts.
if
the
decision
is
rational,
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
judiciary
is
how
i
read
youngberg.
unless
the
decision
is
so
irrational
as
to
make
it
evident
that
it
was
actually
not
based
upon
professional
judgment,
it
must
be
left
untouched.
now,
we
are
not
seeking
a
radical
remedy
in
this
court.
all
we
are
seeking
is
a
continuation
of
that
precedent
and
the
policy
which
has
informed
this
court
over
time
concerning
academic
freedom.
we
contend
that
an
academic
qualification
decision
should
not
be
subject
to
substantive
due
process
review.
we
don't
want
to
bar
the
courtroom
doors
to
students
who
wish
to
assert
that
they
have
been
treated
invidiously,
that
any
of
their
federally
protected
rights
have
been
denied
them,
but
what
we
do
want
to
do
is
keep
the
courts
out
of
the
business
of
making
academic
grade
and
qualification
judgments.
i
submit
that
that
follows
the
precedent
of
horowitz
and
youngberg
and
is
wise
national
policy.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
very
little,
your
honor.
we
seek
here
the
application
of
the
traditional,
rational
basis
test
to
assess
the
eligibility
of
mr.
ewing
to
continue
and
obtain
the
relief
that
he
wants.
clearly
there
were
many
rational
bases
for
the
decision
to
dismiss
scott
ewing
from
registration--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--it
was
the
accumulated
effect
of
his
academic
record,
justice
stevens.
if
the
phrase
appears
once
in
the
record,
it
appears
ten
times,
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back
was
the
failure
on
the
nbme
exam.
mr.
conway
has
just
told
you
that
he
was
failed
solely
because
he
flunked
the
exam.
and,
it
is
true
that
that
was
the
precipitating
factor
which
terminated
his
registration.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
it
is
the
reason
i
devoted
as
much
time
as
i
did
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
justice
stevens,
to
outlining
his
record
for
you,
because
the
decision
of
the
faculty
was
based
upon
multiple
deficiencies,
the
make-up
exams,
the
low
scores.
the
combination
is
the
cumulative
effect
of--
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
--i
think
you
will
find
the
record
and
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
minutes
of
the
five
meetings
to
which
i
made
reference
in
succinct
fashion.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
respondent's
point
or
question,
why
didn't
we
let
him
take
the
test,
and
just
be
done
with
it.
give
him
a
second
chance,
let
him
flunk
it,
no
law
suit.
i
think
there
are
two
good
reasons,
two
good
answers
to
that
question.
the
first
is
that
the
medical
faculty
considers
it
very
important
that
its
students
display
the
ability
to
perform
in
a
timely
way
and
to
do
the
things
they
are
assigned
under
pressure.
mr.
ewing
did
not
demonstrate
that
ability,
in
fact,
quite
the
contrary.
he
was
at
the
six-year
mark
when
he
had
completed
the
work
that
most
inteflex
students
complete
in
four.
but,
the
more
significant
and
important
answer
to
that
question
is
that
our
medical
faculty
feels
very
keenly
its
obligation
to
the
public
to
assure
the
public
that
the
holder
of
a
m.d.
degree
from
michigan
is
a
qualified
physician.
they
had
reached
a
careful
and
considered
judgment
that
mr.
ewing
was
not
going
to
be
a
qualified
physician
and
they
felt
a
duty
to
dismiss
him
from
registration
without
permitting
him
to
go
forward
in
the
program.
i
think
i
will
conclude
with
that
if
the
court
please.
mr.
roderick
k.
daane
justice
powell,
the
motion
was
for
dismissal
of
count
three
of
the
complaint
which
sought
monetary
damages.
the
explanation
is
that
the
decision
by
judge
feikens
was
filed
before
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurst.
pennhurst
changed
all
perception
and
the
court's
perception,
i
think,
of
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
as
it
applied
to
claims
for
injunctive
relief
against
the
state.
it
has
been
clear
for
some
time
that
claims
for
monetary
relief
were
clearly
barred,
but
claims
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
have
been
in
an
even
much
less
clear
area,
if
i
may
say.
pennhurst
changed
that
with
respect
to
claims
for
injunctive
relief
against
states
to
compel
them
to
conform
their
conduct
to
state
law.
and,
at
the
bottom
of
this
case,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
what
plaintiff
seeks,
an
injunction
compelling
the
university
of
michigan
to
conform
its
conduct
to
its
rule.
as
a
constitutional
corporation
of
the
state
of
michigan,
rules
created
by
the
university
may
be
regarded
as
state
laws,
i
think,
within
the
same
scope
as
the
state
laws
which
were
at
issue
in
pennhurst.
therefore,
if
the
case
is
seen
as
an
effort
by
respondent
to
compel
the
university
to
conform
its
conduct
to
this
so-called
rule,
then
i
suggest
that
it
fits
within
the
rubric
of
pennhurst
and
should
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
