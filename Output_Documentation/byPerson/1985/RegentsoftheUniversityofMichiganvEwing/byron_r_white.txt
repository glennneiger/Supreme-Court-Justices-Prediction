what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
argument
though?
what
happens
to
the
property
interest
issue?
we
just
affirm
them
or
not?
justice

well,
i
know,
but
what
if
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
there
is
a
property
interest
there
was
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
are
not
going
to
argue
about
the
property
interest
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
present
the
property
interest
question
in
your
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
going
to
present
it
though,
is
that
right?
