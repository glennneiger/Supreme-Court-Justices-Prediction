well,
maybe
we
think
it
is
narrower
to
decide
it
on
whether
it
is
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
agreement
or
the
understanding
that
students
have
who
are
admitted
to
the
medical
school
in
your
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
provisions
in
the
application
forms
that
make
it
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
faculty
to
retain
the
student?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
there
is
a
motion,
as
i
understand
it,
by
the
respondent
to
be
allowed
to
amend
the
complaint
now
to
name
the
regents
individually.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
try
to
meet
that
issue.
do
you
oppose
the
granting
of
that
motion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
if
they
were
named
individually
that
you
could
still
argue
the
eleventh
amendment
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
the
michigan
courts
addressed
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
the
medical
school
at
the
university
under
the
kind
of
admission
policies
that
are
written
in
the
application?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
rule
are
you
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
conway,
what
is
this
plaintiff's
exhibit
3?
was
this
a
formally
adopted
rule
of
the
university.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
simply
is
a
publication.
it
didn't
form
part
of
the
admissions
application?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
come
out
before
he
applied
for
admission
as
a
student
at
the
university?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
part
of
the
agreement
he
made
with
the
university?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
so
if
it
hadn't
been
published
when
he
was
admitted
as
a
student?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
does
your
client
want
today
by
way
of
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
he
want
to
go
back
to
the
university
of
michigan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
he
alleging
that
he
wants
to
take
the
exam
because
he
wants
to
gain
admission,
re-admission
to
the
medical
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
saying
that
the
faculty
can't
determine
whether
the
student
is
reasonably
qualified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
didn't
take
it
away.
he
took
the
exam
and
flunked
it
badly
and
that
entered
into
the
calculation
of
whether
the
faculty
thought
he
was
qualified.
