mr.
michael
m.
conway
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
regents
must
abide
by
their
own
procedures
and
rules
which
they
have
publicly
promulgated
to
students
to
rely
upon.
the
regents
were
free
in
the
first
instance
in
their
sole
discretion
to
establish
whatever
standards,
rules
of
procedures
they
wanted
to
measure
academic
performance,
including
ewing's
performance,
but
having
set
the
rules
to
govern
this
important
relationship
between
institution
and
student,
the
regents
must
abide
by
their
same
rules
if
those
rules
are
set
on
an
objective
standard.
if,
to
do
otherwise,
would,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
result
in
a
deprivation
of
a
respondent's
property
interest.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
they
do.
under
michigan
law,
justice
rehnquist,
the
booker
case
cited
by
the
sixth
circuit,
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law
that
a
student
is
not
to
be
arbitrarily
dismissed,
in
that
case
from
a
medical
school.
in
this
instance...
the
crucial
thing
that
makes
this
case
so
unique
is
that
the
violation
of
the
rule
resulted
in
the
deprivation
of
the
property
interest;
that
is
his
dismissal.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
under
sindermann
and
all
the
cases,
your
honor,
the
issue
is
where
there
is
a
property
interest
we
look
to
state
law.
in
this
case,
looking
to
state
law,
which
is
michigan
in
this
instance,
there
is
a
property
interest
not
to
be
arbitrarily
dismissed.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
we
have
cited
many
cases
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
which
suggests,
under
various
states,
that
the
relationship
between
a
student
and
a
university
is
contractual.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
well,
your
honor,
as
you
know,
under
sindermann,
it
doesn't
even
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
an
actual
conflict.
under
the
jago
case,
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
a
right.
it
can
be
a
property
interest
under
federal
law
or
for
federal
law
purposes
even
though
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
official
level
of
a
contract.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
the
michigan
law
being
your
honor,
whether
there
is
a
property
interest.
once
there
is
a
property
interest,
then
the
federal
interest
here
is
whether,
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
the
state
or
its
agents
in
their
official
capacity
have
deprived
ewing
of
his
property
interest
which
was
initially
created
by
state
law.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
well
grounded
in
the
precedents
of
this
court
that
there
isn't
any
federal
notion
of
a
property
interest,
that
the
federal
notion
of
a
property
interest
must
look
to
state
law.
that
is
what
the
sindermann
case
stands
for.
that
is
what
the
sixth
circuit
applied.
and,
it
is
very
clear
on
these
facts,
which
distinguish
it
from
some
of
the
other
cases
where
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
was
addressed
by
the
lower
courts,
that
there
is,
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
a
property
interest.
now,
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--your
honor,
i
think
the
courts
have
addressed
it
in
this
sense.
we
have
on
this
fact
record
the
existence
of
a
rule
promulgated
by
michigan.
they
were
free
not
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
i
am
talking
about
plaintiff's
exhibit
3
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
113
and
114.
it
was
published
by
the
regents
and
it
was
actually
disseminated
to
students,
faculty,
and
the
world
approximately
a
week
before
ewing
took
the
examination.
and,
it
quotes
associate
dean
gibson
and
it
is
very
clear
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question
about
what
is
the
rule
in
other
situations.
it
applies
only
to
this
examination
and
it
says
that,
according
to
dean
gibson,
any
student...
and
i
am
paraphrasing...
let
me
quote
it.
according
to
dr.
gibson,
"everything
possible
is
done
to
keep
qualified
medical
students
in
the
medical
school,
this
even
extends
to
taking
and
passing
national
board
exams.
"
"should
a
student
fail
either
part
of
the
national
boards,
an
opportunity
is
provided
to
make-up
the
failure
in
a
second
exam.
"
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
113.
they...
in
this
instance--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--we
don't
have
to
define...
i
am
reading
the
word
"qualified"
as
the
administrators
themselves
read
it.
at
trial
mr.
davis,
counsel
for
michigan,
was
asked
by
the
district
judge,
let's
lay
this
question
to
rest.
was
mr.
ewing
qualified
when
he
went
in
to
take
the
nbme
exam
and
mr.
davis
responded
in
the
affirmative.
similarly,
dean
reed,
who
was
the
director
of
the
inteflex
program,
testified
that
he
was
qualified.
and,
dr.
gibson,
who
is
quoted
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
3,
was
asked
at
trial,
what
does
qualified
mean?
qualified
means
he
has
passed
all
of
his
courses
and
it
was
undisputed
that
ewing
had.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
well,
it
is
not
promulgated
in
the
sense
that
a
federal
regulation
is
promulgated,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
it
is
this
publication
which
i
have
before
you.
it
is
"on
becoming
a
doctor".
it
says,
"medical
center
report,
special
issue,
the
university
of
michigan.
"
at
the
conclusion,
which
we
set
out
this
in
the
joint
appendix,
indicates
that
it
is
part
of
the
medical
center.
it
is
published
under
the
auspices
of
the
university
of
michigan's
regents.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no.
this
publication
came
out,
justice
o'connor,
about
a
week
before
mr.
ewing
took
this
examination.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no,
it
is
some
six
years--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
part
of
the
agreement.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
because,
your
honor,
mr.
ewing
would
have
had
the
option
not
to
take
this
exam
if
he
knew
there
was
one
strike
and
you
are
out.
if
you
know
the
rules
in
advance,
anybody
can
play
the
game.
anybody
can
succeed.
that
is
the
notion
of
fair
play
we
have
here.
they
told
mr.
ewing
that
you
get
two
tries.
it
is
as
if,
your
honor...
let
me
pose
two
hypotheticals.
if
the
university
said
you
need
120
credit
hours
to
graduate
and
a
student
went
through
three
years
at
the
university
and
then
the
university
went
to
a
given
senior
and
said
to
this
woman,
you
have
to
have
150
hours
to
graduate,
just
you,
or
if
you
are
in
a
classroom
and
a
professor
said
you
have
three
hours
to
complete
this
examination
and
after
one
hour
he
randomly
went
and
took
one
student's
exam
away
from
him
and
didn't
let
him
complete
it,
would
the
courts
be
powerless
to
do
anything?
i
think
not.
the
courts
have
thought
not.
for
50
years
courts,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
have
held
that
arbitrary
and
capricious
conduct
can
be
limiting.
what
is
important
here--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--justice
blackmun,
i
suggest
they
are
in
this
instance.
mr.
ewing
knew
he
had
two
chances.
if
he
had
only
had
one
chance,
then
he
would
be
prepared
to
live
or
die
on
his
results.
he
knew
he
had
two
chances.
it
is
like
a
batter.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
i
would,
your
honor.
your
honor,
let
me
please
address
that
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
point
and
i
know
there
is
some
levity
in
response
to
that
point.
this
young
man
is
now
in
medical
school.
he
is
going
to
be
a
physician.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
and,
as
your
honor
knows,
there
is...
an
osteopathic
physician
has
all
the
rights
of
a
m.d.
graduate,
to
perform
surgery
in
all
the
states,
can
perform
in
the
same
manner.
his
school
is
accredited.
there
is
ama
approval
of
osteopathic
schools.
the
significance
of
this,
your
honor,
is
despite
what
the
regents
suggest,
this
court
isn't
going
to
make
mr.
ewing
a
physician.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
court
has
been
asked
to
make
mr.
ewing
a
physician.
all
he
has
asked
for
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
take
the
examination
again.
he
will
live
or
die
by
that.
in
1981,
the
regents
could
have
let
him
take
the
exam
right
then
and
there
and
we
wouldn't
have
had
to
go
to
court
to
try
to
vindicate
this
right.
if
they
thought
he
was
going
to
fail,
let
him
fail.
if
they
thought
he
was
going
to
pass,
why
did
they
treat
him
differently?
this
record
also
indicates
there
is
a
rule.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
the
relief
he
seeks
is
the
right
to
take
this
examination
at
the
university
of
michigan
which
does
two
things.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
it
gives
him
the
opportunity
to
go
back.
he
has
re-enrolled
in
medical
school.
he
is
now
in
his
second
year
of
medical
school.
it
would
give
him
the
opportunity
to
go
back,
but
more
importantly
it
would
give
him
the
opportunity
to
remove
the
stigma
of
his
academic
dismissal
which
is
going
to
follow
him
throughout
his
professional
life.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes.
the
relief
of
the
order
that
is
actually
before
this
court
is
an
order
that
orders
him...
orders
the
regents
to
permit
him
to
take
the
examination
and
if
he
passes
it
to
treat
him
as
if...
to
pass
him
on
to
the
third
phase
which
is
what
they
would
have
done.
the
testimony
is
unequivocal
at
trial
that
the
only
thing
that
has
kept
him
from
going
on
is
he
failed
this
exam.
the
deans
were
unanimous
that
if
he
had
passed
the
exam
he
would
have
been
promoted
to
the
third,
two-year
phase
at--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--sure.
oh,
no.
excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--justice
marshall,
many
people
flunked.
forty
people
flunked.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no,
we
cannot.
but,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
record
is
clear
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
1
that
40
students,
including
mr.
ewing,
between
1975
and
1982
failed
this
examination
on
the
first
try.
thirty-nine
were
given
a
second
chance.
ten
were
given
a
third
chance.
one
was
given
a
fourth
chance.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
third
chance.
we
are
not
asking
a
fourth
chance.
we
are
asking
for
the
rule
to
be
followed
that
michigan
set
forth.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
promised
that
to
the
district
court.
i
promised
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
an
officer
of
the
court
i
will
promise
that
to
you.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
the
record
is
a
little
ambiguous
on
that.
the
evidence
was
that
no
one
in
the
inteflex
program.
the
district
judge
elaborated
and
said
no
one,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
we
put
it
in
our
appendix,
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
brief
of
the
regents,
they
said
the
lowness
of
the
score
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
dismissal.
they
have
disclaimed
that,
just
as
they
have
disclaimed,
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
any
issue
that
there
isn't
a
property
interest
here.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no,
it
didn't
address
that
finding.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
that
he
had
the
lowest
score?
mr.
michael
m.
conway
well,
i
think
the
only
fact
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
that
he
had
the
lowest
score
in
the
inteflex
program.
you
are
bound
by
that.
the
other,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
that.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no,
because
at
discovery
we
were
not
given
access
to
any
of
those
things,
your
honor.
as
you
will
see
from
the
record,
we
were
given
statistical
information
with
names
removed
which
is
what
we
asked
for.
but,
the
significance
of
that,
your
honor,
counsel
wants
to
tell
you
about
mr.
ewing's
various
shortcomings.
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
whatever
they
may
be,
it
isn't
for
a
court
to
decide
if
they
are
important.
the
people
who
decide
they
are
important
are
the
professors
and
the
professors
said
he
was
qualified.
he
had
no
deficiencies.
justice
stevens
asked
about
this
letter.
well,
the
record
is
clear...
it
is
in
joint
appendix
at
81
and
82...
that
every
time
he
got
a
warning
it
was
removed
and
one
of
those
warning
letters,
plaintiff's
exhibit
9
is
in
the
record.
and,
it
says,
we
congratulate
you,
that
your
deficiency
has
been
removed.
now,
what
it
turned
out
at
trial
was
there
was
a
notion
of
forgiven
but
not
forgotten.
but,
in
fact,
what
was
told
mr.
ewing
was
that
he
was
removed
and
the
most
important
thing
is
the
dean
said
he
was
qualified.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
no,
justice
rehnquist,
but
they
didn't
have
to
tell
him
it
was
removed
either
and
they
did.
and,
the
significance
here
is
mr.
daane
refers
to
the
board
minutes.
let's
talk
about
the
board
minutes.
we
objected
to
the
board
minutes
at
trial
as
being
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation
and
as
being
hearsay.
the
district
judge
permitted
those
to
be
received
in
evidence.
we
raised
that
objection
in
the
sixth
circuit
very
strenuously
about
the
inadmissibility
of
these
exhibits.
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
pass
on
it
because
they
ruled
in
respondent's
favor.
so,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
they
can't
rely
on
evidence
to
which
objection
has
been
made--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--why
should
this
court
for
the
first
time
address
the
evidentiary
point--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--well,
justice,
i
think
prudentially
i
don't
know
why
you
would
want
to
get
into
an
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
on.
the
only
reason
they
didn't
pass
on
it
is
they
found
that
with
those
in
the
record
there
was
a
rule
and
it
had
been
violated.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
i
don't
know
of
any
state
law,
justice
marshall.
there
may
be
one,
but
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
the
testimony
at
trial
was
that
the
minutes
were
prepared
and
reviewed
by
counsel.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
there
is
the
exception
under
8038,
justice
marshall,
but
there
also
is
the
doctrine
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation
and
the
testimony
at
trial
was
that
they
were--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--i
think
it
would
apply
to
any
document
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
your
honor,
there
are
many
other
fine
graduates
of
the
university's
medical
school
who
failed
this
examination
two
times,
three
times,
four
times.
on
the
academic
record
by
the
university's
own
calculation
out
of
23
courses
he
had
difficulties
in
three
of
them.
there
were
students
who
had
them
in
70
percent
of
their
courses,
50
percent
of
their
courses,
9
out
of
23
in
the
same
inteflex
program.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
approximately
a
b
minus
average.
it
was
2.7
or
8
at
the
time
he
sat
for
the
examination.
he
was
in
good
standing.
he
was
in
a
difficult
inteflex
program
which
takes--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--it
doesn't,
your
honor.
that
is
why
it
is
arbitrary.
let
me
return
to
the
romeo
test.
i
think
the
romeo
test
is
very
akin
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test.
it
was
advanced
by
the
aaup
here.
and,
the
test
is
very
similar,
because
the
romeo
test
says
was
there
such
a
substantial
departure
from
past
judgment,
practice
or
procedure
that
indicates
that
the
presumed
validity
of
the
professional
decision
can
be
overcome.
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
is
really
in
substance
no
different
than
that
because
it
is
prima
facie
correct
and
it
has
to
be
shown
to
have
no
rational
basis.
and,
i
think
the
aaup's
suggestion
that
the
romeo
and
younger
serves
as
an
appropriate
vehicle.
i
agree
with
them.
it
is
akin
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
which
have
been
applied
by
these
courts
which
was
discussed
in
dictum
in
horowitz.
the
significance
of
it
here...
let's
look
at
the
past
judgment,
practice
and
policy.
the
judgment
of
the
regents
was
they
will
allow
people
two
tests.
they
published
that
in
their
rule.
they
gave
it
to
everybody.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
well,
your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--exhibit
3,
your
honor.
that
is
the
pamphlet
on
becoming
a
doctor.
and,
the
significance
of
that,
your
honor,
is
that
they
held
it
out
to
the
community
to
rely
upon.
and,
if
you
look
at
their
past...
and
also,
we
have
the
fact
that
every
other
student
similarly
situated
was
given
a
second
chance.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
that
is
their
argument,
but
that
is
not
their
evidence,
your
honor.
he
is
the
only
student
among
the
40
to
have
an
honor's
grade
and
published
research.
but,
i
don't
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
court
needs
to
delve
into
that,
because
what
the
sixth
circuit
held
was
under
the
university's
own
rule
of
a
qualified
student
he
was
qualified.
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
create
a
rule.
you
know,
the
notion
of
substantive
due
process
connotes
to
some
people
that
judges
making
new
policy.
that
is
not
what
we
are
asking
for
here.
what
we
are
asking
for
here...
i
think
that
is
why
the
romeo
test
is
an
appropriate
analysis.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
and
they
did.
they
determined
he
was
reasonably
qualified
and
let
him
take
the
exam.
it
is
just,
justice
o'connor,
as
if
they
said
you
are
qualified
to
take
this
final
exam
and
you
begin
taking
it
and
half
way
through
they
take
your
paper
away.
the
notion
here
was
you
got
two--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
it
didn't
because
of
two
things.
one,
the
suggestion
that
there
was
some
kind
of
deliberative
process
is
unsupported
by
the
record.
while
the
students
routinely
came
up
on
the
agenda,
it
was
also
said
that
they...
everyone
was
routinely
given
a
second
chance.
so,
there
isn't
any
calculus
here
of
a
discretionary
judgment.
they
made
their
judgment.
this
exam,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court,
is
constructed
so
that
10
percent
fail.
regardless
of
your
raw
score,
10
percent
fail,
that
it
is
a
bell
curve.
so,
the
university
has
suggested,
for
example,
that
they
have
now
raised
the
score.
they
didn't
tell
you.
they
raised
it
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
5.
now
students
get
three
chances,
every
student,
the
published
rules
disseminated
to
their
faculty.
the
nbme
itself,
which
administers
this
exam...
plaintiff's
exhibit
5...
i
am
sorry,
it
is
4
and
5
is
their
rule.
four
says
that
every
student
under
the
nbme's
guidelines
gets
three
chances.
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
is
that
ewing
was
singled
out.
and,
when
counsel
goes
and
suggests
to
you
some
particular
factual
matter--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--no,
your
honor,
i
can't,
and
that
is
the
bottom-line
notion
of
an
arbitrary
decision.
they
said
he
was
qualified.
dean
reed,
with
whom
he
spoke
right
after
he
took
the
exam,
and
dean
reed
was
the
dean
in
charge
of
this
program...
told
him,
oh,
yes,
you
will
probably
be
given
a
second
chance.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
there
is
nothing
in
the
record--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
he
did
not
have
the
worse
record,
justice
marshall.
many
students
had
three
and
four
times
the
number
of
deficiencies
he
had
and
they
were
given
chances.
many
students
were
given
three
times,
some
four.
and,
i
think
when
counsel
tries
to--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--that
was
the
testimony,
but
there--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--yes.
but,
your
honor,
if
i
might
address
that
point,
it
is
also--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--let
me
offer
an
explanation
then,
your
honor.
the
standard
students,
the
testimony
is
clear,
were
measured
on
the
same
score.
thirty-two
of
them
failed
this
examination.
we
don't
know
what
their
scores
were.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
it
wouldn't
be
irrational
except
they
testified
they
treated
them
the
same.
at
this
stage
in
their
career,
your
honor,
the
standards
students
are
going
to
go
into
their
last
two
years,
which
is
the
third
and
fourth
year
of
medical
school,
the
inteflex
are
going
into
the
last
two
years,
the
fifth
and
sixth.
they
get
combined.
they
have
taken
the
same
basic
medical
school
courses
and
the
university
testified
that
they
treated
them
the
same.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
guess
the
only
point
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
there
was
a
rule,
found
that
it
applied
to
ewing,
and
found
that
it
was
violated.
those
are
the
findings
of
the
court's
judgment
that
is
being
reviewed
here.
in
the
petition,
the
regents
have
not
suggested
that
the
sixth
circuit
applied
the
purely
erroneous
standard
in
some
different
fashion,
haven't
cited
any
error
in
that
regard.
so,
the
factual
predicate
that
the
legal
issue
arises
on
here
is
the
sixth
circuit's
finding
that
there
was
a
rule,
it
applied
to
ewing,
that
ewing
was
qualified
within
the
meaning
of
the
regents'
own
standards,
and
that
he
was
dismissed
despite
that
and
his
dismissal
resulted
in
the
deprivation
of
his
property
interest
to
not
be
arbitrarily
dismissed.
that
is
the
record--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--yes.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
the
property
interest
that
gives
rights
to
federal
claim,
if
i
could
answer
this
way,
your
honor,
is
his
dismissal.
if
a
rule
were
violated,
but
as
a
result
of
that
violation
of
a
rule
there
was
no
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process...
for
example,
if
ewing
were
dismissed
because,
after
taking
this
exam,
he
went
to
a
clinical
course
where
in
fact
he
got
an
honors,
but
let's
say
he
had
done
something
in
the
judgment
of
the
faculty
his
performance
was
so
poor
he
should
be
dismissed
for
that,
then
there
would
be
no
violation
of
his
property
interest
because
he
couldn't
retake
the
exam
because
for
some
other
reason
he
was
dismissed.
the
significance
here
is
the
combination
of
the
fact
that
the
violation
of
the
rule
resulted
in
the
deprivation
of
the
property
interest.
he
might
have
a
contract
claim
under
state
law
if
it
were
important
enough
and
not
a
trivial
matter,
but
he
wouldn't
have
a
federal
claim
because
what
michigan
has
defined
as
his
property
interest
is
his
dismissal,
not
some
right
to
take
the
exam.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes.
under
the
booker
case,
cited
by
the
sixth
circuit,
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
held
there
is
a
property
right
not
to
be
arbitrarily
dismissed.
let
me
briefly
address
the
eleventh
amendment
issues.
i
think
there
are
three
answers
to
that
argument
that
was
first
raised
in
the
rehearing.
the
first
is
that
the
suit
against
the
regents
has
always
been
considered
by
the
regents
to
be
against
the
regents
in
their
official
capacity.
that
can
be
shown
from
the
joint
appendix
where
they
argue
that
the
money
damage
claim
was
barred
under
edelman
v.
jordan,
but
said
to
the
district
court
you
can
enter
an
injunctive
relief
against
us.
that
is
somebody
who
thinks
the
suit
is
against
the
officials
in
their
official
capacity.
secondly,
we
have
filed,
justice
o'connor,
a
motion
to
amend
under
the
teachings
of
brandon
v.
holt
where
an
amendment
was
permitted
even
though
no
motion
had
been
filed.
and,
there
is
no
prejudice
shown
here.
there
has
been
no
objection
filed
by
the
regents.
and,
under
rule
15(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
it
is
appropriate
to
conform
the
evidence,
to
conform
the
pleadings
to
the
evidence.
finally,
under
the
toll
case
in
this
court,
the
regents
waived
any
claim
that
they
now
belatedly
assert,
because
they
told
the
district
court
that
they
would
be
liable
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
right
away.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
tactic
that
the
regents
continue.
and,
i
refer
your
honor
to
the
case
of
spielberg
v.
regents,
cited
in
our
brief,
a
1985
decision
where,
according
to
the
reported
case...
it
is
spielberg
v.
board
of
regents.
it
is
judge
feikens
again.
it
is
a
1983
action.
it
is
a
full
consideration
and
the
eleventh
amendment
is
not
mentioned
there.
you
know,
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
i
have
proposed
to
the
court
strike
the
court
as
far-fetched,
but
they
are
not.
in
this
instance,
for
example,
in
crook
v.
baker,
cited
in
our
brief,
these
same
regents
were
found
to
have
rescinded
a
graduate
student's
degree
after
the
fact.
now,
the
relief
we
are
seeking
is
very
limited
here.
the
decision
of
the
professional
judgment
of
the
act
of
admissions
is
prima
facie
correct.
unless
there
is
such
a
substantial
departure,
as
we
believe
there
is
in
this
case,
that
presumption
carries
today.
but,
if
there
is
a
substantial
departure,
whether
we
look
at
it
under
the
romeo
test
proposed
by
the
american
association
of
university
professors
in
their
amicus
brief,
if
you
look
at
it
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test
which
has
been
discussed
by
the
courts
heretofore,
the
result
is
the
same.
there
is
no
rational
reason
for
this
decision
and
the--
mr.
michael
m.
conway
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
m.
conway
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
consequence
is
in
this
case
that
his
dismissal...
and
the
testimony
of
the
deans
is
clear...
his
dismissal
arose
strictly
from
failing
the
exam.
had
he
passed
the
exam,
he
would
have
been
promoted.
let's
remember
that
if
he
goes
back
to
michigan,
he
is
going
to
be
under
the
tutelage
of
this
faculty
for
two
more
years.
he
is
not
going
to
be
made
a
physician
by
any
judgment
of
this
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
understand,
your
honor,
that
he
will
take
an
examination
similar
to
the
nbme
for
osteopathic
medical
schools
in
his
current
institution.
i
should
also
say
that
a
recent...
if
i
may,
that
a
recent
ama
journal
article
indicates
that
less
than
half
of
the
medical
schools
require
this
exam.
but,
we
have
never
asked
that
the
exam
be
waived
or
that
he
be
promoted.
we
are
only
asking
that
the
university
which
promulgated
some
rules
be
bound
to
apply
those
rules
to
the
students
they
promulgated
it
to
so
he
can
have
this
opportunity
and
he
will
live
or
die
by
the
result.
thank
you,
your
honors.
