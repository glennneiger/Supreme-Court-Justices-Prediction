justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
why
you
make
that
assumption?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
concede
it,
do
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
you
simply
make
an
assumption?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
said
he
thought
the
question
was
in
the
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
daane,
this
suit
is
against
the
state
of
michigan,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
consider
the
eleventh
amendment
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
going
to
argue
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
rest
on
your
briefs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
we
have
jurisdiction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
there
any
similar
motion
made
before
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
neither
of
those
courts
have
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
this
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
whether
you
are
reading
the
word
"qualified"
in
your
interpretation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
conway,
as
i
read
the
record,
no
one
ever
had
a
lower
score
as
your
client
on
that
exam,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
my
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
court
of
appeals
conclude
that
that
finding
of
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
we
bound
by
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
your
client
had
the
lowest
score
of
any
medical
student
who
had
ever
taken
this
examination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
there
was
anyone
who
ever
made
consistently
as
low
grades
as
your
client?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
just
to
clarify
my
understanding
of
the
case?
the
district
court's
first
opinion
back
in
1982
concluded
by
holding
that
the
university
was
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
that
there
had
been
no
waiver
of
that
immunity.
and
the
subsequent
opinion
of
the
district
court
addressed
the
substantive
issue
in
the
case
without
deciding
it
on
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
what
is
the
explanation
of
that?
