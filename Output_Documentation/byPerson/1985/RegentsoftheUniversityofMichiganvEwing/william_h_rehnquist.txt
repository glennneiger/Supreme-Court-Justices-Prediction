justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
i
am
not
sure
i
agree
with
justice
white
on
that.
your
second
question
presented,
as
i
read
it,
is
the
state
medical
school
procedurally
correct,
dismissal
of
an
academically
deficient
student
subject
to
substantive
due
process
review
and
reversal
by
the
federal
court.
i
think
that
raises
the
property
issue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
daane,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit...
i
am
looking
now
at
page
33-a
where
that
opinion
is
contained
in
the
petition...
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"in
sum,
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
it
was
the
consistent
practice
of
the
university
of
michigan
to
allow
a
qualified
medical
student
who
initially
failed
the
nbme,
part
i,
an
opportunity
for
a
retest.
"
do
you
challenge
that
factual
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
then
is
it
was
the
consistent
practice
or
at
least
a
consistent
result,
but
the
circumstances
were
sufficiently
different
in
ewing's
case
so
that
a
different
result
was
justified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
those
rules
kind
of
amount
to
a
contract
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
then
what,
do
the
federal
courts
simply
apply
michigan
contract
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
based
on
an
agreement
between
the
regents
and
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
there
a
federal
parole
evidence
rule,
a
federal
statute
of
frauds
to
govern
these
kinds
of
contractual
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
i
thought
you
said
the
federal
court
just
to
apply
michigan
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
slicing
it
awfully
thin,
isn't
it,
the
distinction
between
federal
law
and
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
irrational
to
say
that
it
is
forgiven
but
not
forgotten.
i
mean,
he
may
have
come
perilously
close
to
flunking
out
at
one
point,
then
he
brings
himself
up.
so,
whatever
warning
was
on
then,
but
if
it
happens
three
times,
they
don't
have
to
act
as
if
it
was
the
first
time
it
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
which
the
district
court
overruled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
dealing
with
a
record
made
up
in
the
district
court
and
as
i
understand
it
these
were
proffered
by
the
defendant,
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
district
court.
you
challenged
the
admission
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
pass
on
it.
are
you
saying
we
can't
consider
that
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
doctrine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
they
published
it
in
their
rule.
are
you
talking
about
the
brochure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wasn't
asking
about
the
sixth
circuit
character,
i
was
asking
you
if
they
published
it
in
their
brochure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
faculty
argues
that
this
guy
was
such
a
loser
that
he
was
not
similarly
situated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
did
have
the
lowest
scores
in
the
inteflex
program,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
make
a
finding
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
there
to
address
so
far
as
that
particular
factual
question?
there
may
be
an
explanation
as
to
why
it
may
not
be
relevant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
it
isn't
irrational
for
a
faculty
to
treat
people
in
an
inteflex
program
differently
from
people
not
in
the
inteflex
program.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
strikes
me
that
a
number
of
reasons
pop
up
during
your
argument
which
would,
you
know,
plausibly
or
facially
justify
different
treatment
for
your
client
than
the
others.
you
have
an
explanation
that
satisfies
you
for
all
them,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
there
are
that
many
plausible
reasons,
you
are
getting
away
from
something
that
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
you
are
getting
to
just
a
judgment
call
as
to
why
you
don't
think
it
should
have
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position,
i
suppose,
had
the
regents
raised
such
a
defense
in
the
district
court,
perhaps
you
would
have
amended--
