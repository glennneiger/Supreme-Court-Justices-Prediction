do
i
understand
you
to
say
you
believe
that
you
can
amend
a
complaint
in
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
willing
to
let
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
with
him
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
give
me
one
precedent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
as
responsible
for
jurisdiction
as
he
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
he
goes
back,
you
can't
get
rid
of
the
fact
that
he
did
flunk
more
times
than
anybody
else
ever
flunked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
get
rid
of
that,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
promise
us
that
if
we
agree
with
you
and
he
flunks
again
you
won't
ask
for
another
one?

justice
thurgood

this
is
a
state
institution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
the
minutes
are
prepared
pursuant
to
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
minutes
of
a
state
agency
that
aren't
admissible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
a
state
institution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
can't
get
away
from
the
point
that
you
can't
correct
his
image.
if
we
rule
and
give
you
everything
you
want,
you
can't
erase
that
man's
image.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
an
idea
why...
w-h-y...
why
ewing
was
singled
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
just
out
of
the
clear
blue
they
decided
one
guy
we
will
sock
it
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and,
they
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
the
worse
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
property
right
the
dismissal?
