this

against
ewing.
mr.

proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
university's
policy.
suppose
the
medical
student
is
taking
15
courses
and
he
fails
all
15.
is
he
given
a
rerun
on
every
one
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
an
element
in
this
case,
isn't
it,
in
the
light
of
the
statement
of
the
policy
of
allowing
re-examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
this
record
about
whether
there
are
allowed
a
third
crack
at
the
examination
if
they
fail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
conway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
daane?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
