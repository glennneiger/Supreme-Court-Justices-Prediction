justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
at
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
all
of
this
relevant
to?
if
he
has
no
constitutional
right,
the
university
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
this,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
legal
point
you
are
making?
i
am
kind
of
curious.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
they
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
that,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
that
go
to
the
question
of
what
they
were
required
to
do
which
is
really
what
we
are
interested
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question
about
the
eleventh
amendment.
in
your
principal
brief
you
start
out
arguing
the
eleventh
amendment
and
then
when
you
reach
the
merits
you
said
that
the
decision
on
the
merits,
it
sounded
a
shock
wave
throughout
the
community
of
medical
schools
throughout
the
country.
you
apparently...
suggesting
to
me
at
least
that
you
thought
it
of
great
national
importance
that
the
merits
be
addressed.
then
you
really
didn't
argue
eleventh
amendment
again.
i
was
wondering
if
perhaps
you
have
decided
to
waive
it
so
we
could
reach
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
waiving
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
let
the
shock
wave
have
its
effect.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
refer
to
that
warning,
are
you
referring
to
the
warning
on
page
146
that
you
called
our
attention
to
once
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
really
doesn't
quite
say
that.
it
says
it
will
be
grounds
for
dismissal.
it
doesn't
say
he
would
be
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
conway,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
his
grade
average
was
at
the
time
he
stood
for
the
examination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask
if,
in
your
view,
the
record
tells
us
why
he
was
dismissed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
conway,
can
i
clarify
one
thing
in
my
own
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
property
interest,
as
i
understand
it
under
your
presentation,
is
an
interest
in
not
being
dismissed
from
the
school
arbitrarily?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
conceptually
at
least
is
different
from
a
property
right
to
retake
an
exam.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
there
was
a
property
right
to
retake
the
exam,
the
contract
right
it
would
have
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
your
client
were
able
to
retake
the
exam
other
than
being
sponsored
through
the
university
of
michigan,
say
through
his
present
institution
or
maybe
this
national
organization
would
let
him
take
it
and
he
passed
with
flying
colors,
he
got
a
perfect
score.
would
you
say
that
michigan
would
then
be
constitutionally
obligated
to
readmit
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
that
one
point?
what
was
the
reason
for
his
dismissal
from
the
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
accumulation
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
better
than
a
b
minus
average
plus
the
failure
of
the
exam
on
a
very
low
score?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
to
be
inferred
from
the
record
as
a
whole
or
is
there
some
document
where
that
reason
is
set
forth
in
a
rather
succinct
fashion?
