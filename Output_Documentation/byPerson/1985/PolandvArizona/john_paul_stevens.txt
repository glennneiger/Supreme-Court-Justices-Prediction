may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that
precluded
a
second
sentencing
hearing
in
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
still
not
entirely
clear
not
entirely
clear
on
your
submission.
your
submission
is
that
if
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
particular
aggravating
circumstance
on
which
the
trial
judge
relied,
there
cannot
be
a
second
death
penalty
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
in
rumsey
there
was
a
decision
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
which
is
tantamount
to
an
acquittal
in
the
second
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right,
and
therefore
you
have
something
tantamount
to
an
acquittal,
which
bars
a
second
hearing,
but
you
don't
have
anything
tantamount
to
an
acquittal
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
was
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
no,
it
wasn't
the
equivalent
of
burke
either,
because
it
was
not
a
holding
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
a
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
that
case
the
second
bite
enabled
them
to
put
in
evidence
to
shore
up
the
case
that
was
deficient.
here
they
use
exactly
the
same
evidence
which
they
claim
is
sufficient
and
was
always
sufficient,
if
i
understand
the
case.
it
is
rather
complicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
grant,
may
i
ask
you
if
there
had
not
been
a
setting
aside
of
the
conviction
and
the
appeal
was
only
on
the
death
penalty,
and
they
had
then
done
exactly
what
they
did,
under
your
view,
as
a
matter
of
arizona
law,
i
am
curious,
would
the
arizona
supreme
court
have
had
the
authority
to
affirm
the
death
penalty
changing
the
rationale
by
saying
that
he
made
an
error
of
law
on
the
pecuniary
circumstance,
aggravating
circumstance,
even
though
the
other
one
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
be
sure
that
he
would
have
opposed
the
death
penalty--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
this
different
mix
of
aggravating
circumstances?
