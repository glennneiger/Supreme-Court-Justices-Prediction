mr.
gerald
r.
grant
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
may
24th,
1977,
the
petitioners
michael
and
patrick
poland,
disguised
as
police
officers
stopped
a
purolator
armored
van
on
an
interstate
highway
north
of
phoenix.
the
van
and
its
guards,
cecil
newkirk
and
russell
dempsey,
were
on
their
way
on
a
regularly
scheduled
run
to
deliver
money
to
banks
in
northern
arizona.
the
petitioners
managed
to
subdue
the
guards,
and
they
removed
something
in
excess
of
$280,000
in
cash
from
the
van
and
took
it
with
them.
the
following
morning,
petitioners
rented
a
boat
at
lake
mead
in
northern
arizona.
they
put
the
guards
on
the
boat,
took
them
out
onto
the
lake,
put
them
in
canvas
bags,
weighted
the
bags
down
with
rocks,
and
dropped
them
into
the
water,
where
they
drowned.
it
was
based
upon
these
facts--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--yes,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
the
medical
examiner
at
the
trial
indicated
that
the
cause
of
death
of
both
men
was
drowning.
he
had
a
slight
qualification
with
respect
to
mr.
dempsey
in
that
he
found
some
evidence
of
heart
disease,
and
he
testified
that
that
could
have
been
a
possible
cause
of
death.
however,
his
testimony
was
that
the
cause
of
death
of
both
men
was
drowning.
it
was
based
upon
these
facts
that
petitioners
were
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
petitioners
are
now
claiming
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
precludes
their
death
sentences
because
the
arizona
supreme
court
acquitted
them
of
the
death
penalty
on
their
first
appeal.
respondent
submits
that
no
court
in
the
state
of
arizona
has
acquitted
petitioners
of
the
death
penalty,
and
that
the
state
has
never
failed
to
prove
its
case
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
petitioners
admit
that
the
trial
court
imposed
the
death
penalty
at
their
first
sentencing.
with
respect
to
the
trial
court's
findings
at
that
sentencing,
however,
the
petitioners
do
not
clearly
focus
on
all
the
findings
that
the
trial
court
made.
according
to
petitioners,
the
trial
court
simply
found
that
one
aggravating
circumstance
existed,
that
being
the
cruel,
heinous,
or
depraved
nature
of
the
killings.
petitioners
also
maintain
that
the
trial
court
simply
found
that
a
second
factor,
that
being
that
the
killings
were
committed
for
a
pecuniary
motive,
did
not
exist.
the
trial
court's
findings
were
not
that
simple,
especially
with
respect
to
the
pecuniary
gain
factor.
counsel
in
argument
has
likened
the
trial
court's
handling
of
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
in
this
case
to
the
handling
of
that
same
factor
by
the
trial
court
in
rumsey--
they
were
not
handled
the
same.
in
rumsey,
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
did
not
exist,
period.
in
this
case,
the
state's
evidence
in
support
of
the
factor
was
that
the
killings
were
obviously
committed
for
the
obtaining
of
a
financial
profit,
that
being
the
money
taken
from
the
vans.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
that
was
one
of
the--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--yes,
if
a...
yes,
that
would
have...
that
amounted
to
an
aggravating
factor
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
it
is
not
irrelevant.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
it
is
an
additional
reason
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
evidence
regarding
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
was
never
disputed
by
petitioners
at
the
first
sentencing.
it
has
never
been
disputed
at
any
stage
of
this
case.
there
is
no
claim
that
the
state
failed
to
prove
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravating
factor.
the
only
argument
that
petitioners
made
at
sentencing
and
even
at
resentencing
was
that
the
legal
meaning
of
the
factor
did
not
apply
to
that
evidence.
the
dispute
was
between
whether
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
applied
to
contract
killings
only
or
whether
it
went
farther
to
embrace
all
killings
where
the
obtaining
of
money
is
a
motivating
factor
in
the
killing.
at
the
time
of
the
first
sentencing,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
trial
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
later
arizona
supreme
court
opinions
defining
the
pecuniary
gain
factor.
it
thus
faced
the
problem
of
determining
for
itself
what
the
exact
legal
meaning
of
the
factor
was.
what
the
trial
court
did
was,
it
took
note
of
the
two
conflicting
theories.
it
then
made
findings
of
fact
regarding
each
of
those
theories--
it
stated
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
was
a
contract
killing.
it
went
on
to
state
that
the
evidence
clearly
did
show
that
the
killings
were
committed
for
a
financial
motive.
it
then
made
what
respondent
refers
to
as
a
conditional
finding.
it
stated,
if
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
is
limited
to
the
contract
killing
situation,
it
does
not
exist
here.
if,
however,
it
goes
farther
than
the
contract
killing
situation,
it
does
apply
here.
essentially,
what
the
trial
court
did
was
make
evidentiary
findings
and
left
the
legal
question
on
the
meaning
of
the
pecuniary
gain
back
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
reading
poland
i
and
poland
ii
together,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
did.
however,
in
poland
ii,
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
already
reversed
the
convictions.
the
case
was
already
going
back.
in
the
event
of
a
conviction
or
first
degree
murder,
there
was
going
to
be
another
sentencing
hearing.
for
that
reason,
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
not
take
the
extra
step
and
say,
yes,
indeed,
this
exists
here
and
it
supports
the
death
penalty.
there
was
no
need
to
at
that
point,
because
it
had
already
reversed
the
convictions.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
it
reversed
the
convictions
based
upon
an
allegation
of
misconduct
by
the
jury.
that
is
what
it
did
first,
before
discussing
the
findings
by
the
trial
court
with
respect
to
the
aggravating
factors.
after
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
reversed
the
conviction,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
it
went
on
to
discuss
the
findings
on
the
aggravating
factors.
it
stated
with
respect
to
the
cruel,
heinous,
and
depraved
factor
that
the
evidence,
in
the
court's
words,
"so
far
produced"
was
not
sufficient
to
support
the
trial
court's
finding.
on
the
pecuniary
gain
factor,
it
quoted
the
exact
findings
that
the
trial
court
had
made.
it
then
noted
the
trial
court's
confusion
over
the
legal
meaning
of
the
pecuniary
gain
factor.
it
provided
the
trial
court
with
the
correct
definition
of
that
factor,
and
then
it
in
effect
advised
the
trial
court
that
in
the
event
of
a
conviction
following
a
retrial,
that
that
factor
could
be
found
again.
petitioner's
contention
is
that
an
acquittal
occurred
on
the
death
penalty
issue
at
the
first
appeal.
i
believe
the
basis
of
the
argument
for
an
acquittal
is
that
when
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
the
evidence
insufficient
with
respect
to
the
cruel,
heinous,
or
depraved
factor,
essentially
there
was
nothing
left
to
support
the
death
penalty.
this
position
fails
to
deal
with
the
trial
court's
finding
on
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravating
factor
and
the
supreme
court's
own
discussion
regarding
that
same
factor.
there
is
admittedly
no
failure
of
proof
with
respect
to
that
factor.
even
at
resentencing,
there
was
no
argument
by
the
petitioners
that
the
state's
evidence
was
exactly
the
same
as
it
had
been
at
the
first
sentencing,
did
not
show
that
these
killings
were
committed
with
a
financial
motive.
even
though
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
that
one
aggravating
factor
was
not
sufficient
would
prove
the
trial
court's
findings
with
respect
to
the
aggravating
factor
were
sufficient
to
prevent
an
acquittal
in
poland
i.
one
of
the
major
factors
in
this
court's
decisions
regarding
double
jeopardy
cases,
it
involves
the
special
treatment
that
acquittals
are
given.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
designed
to
protect
defendants
from
having
to
go
through
a
second
ordeal
of
a
trial
or
in
death
penalty
cases
that
are
sufficiently
like
a
trial,
a
second
sentencing
proceeding.
a
retrial
after
an
acquittal
would
force
a
defendant
to
undergo
that
ordeal
a
second
time.
therefore,
when
the
proceedings
terminate
in
favor
of
the
defendant
with
an
acquittal,
double
jeopardy
protection
will
apply,
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
there
simply
no
acquittal.
there
was
no
point
in
this
case
when
the
defendants
could
consider
themselves
free
of
the
death
penalty.
the
trial
court's
findings
with
respect
to
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
kept
that
issue
open,
and
prevented
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision
in
poland
i
from
amounting
to
an
acquittal
on
the
issue
of
the
death
penalty.
in
the
absence
of
such
an
acquittal,
the
rationale
that
this
court
discussed
in
pierce
would
apply
here,
but
petitioners'
appeal
and
obtaining
of
a
reversal
of
their
convictions
on
appeal
in
effect
wipes
the
slate
clean
and
allows
not
only
for
a
second
trial
but
for
a
second
sentencing.
there
has
been
some
argument
in
the
brief
regarding
a
failure
to
appeal
by
the
state
with
respect
to
the
trial
court's
finding
at
the
first
sentencing.
it
is
respondent's
position
that
there
was
simply
no
need
for
the
state
to
appeal
from
that
finding.
there
had
been
nothing
decided,
to
its
detriment.
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
evidence
the
state
presented
supported
a
finding
that
the
killings
were
committed
for
a
financial
motive.
furthermore,
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
all
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
has
been
imposed
does
conduct
what
it
calls
an
independent
review.
that
review
is
not
the
usual
review
that
an
appellate
court
does
when
it
comes
to
reviewing
evidence.
with
respect
to
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors,
the
arizona
supreme
court
conducts
an
independent
review.
it
independently
weighs
the
evidence
regarding
each
aggravating
factor
and
each
mitigating
factor
and
determines
the
weight
for
itself
they
should
be
given.
because
of
that
independent
review
performed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court,
there
was
no
need
for
the
state
to
appeal
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
my
opinion
is
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
does
have
that
power.
in
the
exercise
of
that
power,
however,
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
other
cases
has
tended
to
exercise
it
carefully,
and
in
that
type
of
situation
they
normally
handled
it
by
remanding
it
to
the
trial
court
for
a
clarification
and
a
resentencing.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
that
is
generally
the
way
that
they
handled
it,
although
i
do
submit
that
they
have
the
power
to
treat
it
differently
and
to
make
the
findings
themselves.
in
conclusion,
the
respondent's
position
is
simply
that
there
has
been
no
acquittal
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
case
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings.
there
has
been
no
failure
of
proof
on
the
part
of
the
state.
because
of
that,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
respondents
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
i
have
no
further
comments.
thank
you.
