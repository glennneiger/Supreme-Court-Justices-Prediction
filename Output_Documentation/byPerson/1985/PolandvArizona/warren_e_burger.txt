e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
poland
against
arizona
and
the
related
case.
mr.
wilhelmsen,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
grant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
clear
that
they
were
still
living
when
they
were
dropped
in
the
water?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
death
penalty
have
been
justified
here
only
on
the
manner
in
which
these
people
were
murdered,
tying
them
in
a
sack
and
dropping
them
in
the
water?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
have
been
enough
alone,
if
there
had
been
no
mitigating...
showing
of
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
in
your
view
the
fact
that
they
made
$281,000
out
of
it
is
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
it
is
cumulative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wilhelmsen?
