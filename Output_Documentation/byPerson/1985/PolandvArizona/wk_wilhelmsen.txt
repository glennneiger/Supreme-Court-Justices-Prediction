mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
for
a
brief
background
of
the
case,
the
two
petitioners
are
charged
and
convicted
and
on
death
row
for
murder
resulting
from
the
death
of
two
purolator
guards
who
were
delivering
some
$338,000
cash
in
northern
arizona.
they
left
phoenix.
they
disappeared.
the
next
morning
they
find
the
van.
the
two
guards
are
gone.
some
$281,000
of
the
money
is
gone.
the
bodies
are
subsequently
found
a
month
later
apparently
drowning
and/or
combination
heart
attack
in
the
case
of
mr.
dempsey.
the
bodies
are
recovered
on
the
nevada
side
of
lake
mead
in
debbie's
cove.
those
facts
are
not
what
we
are
really
talking
about
today.
we
are
talking
an
issue
of
double
jeopardy.
the
polands
went
to
trial.
they
were
convicted.
pursuant
to
our
procedure
on
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
the
trial
court
on
the
first
sentencing
proceeding
found
one
aggravating
circumstance,
especially
heinous,
cruel
and
depraved.
he
specifically
found
no
on
pecuniary
gain,
but
he
qualified
that
answer,
and
i
will
get
back
to
that
later.
they
were
sentenced
to
death.
the
court
did
find
certain
mitigating
circumstances,
that
they
had
good
character,
close
family
ties,
model
prisoners,
and
the
court
did
consider
their
age.
automatic
appeal
under
our
procedure.
the
case
is
appealed
to
the
arizona
supreme
court.
they,
in
handling
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial,
they
find
that
there
has
been
jury
impropriety
that
is
not
material
here,
that
they
are
granted
a
new
trial
on
the
guilt
phase.
the
court
goes
on
to
discuss
the
punishment
phase,
and
in
discussing
the
punishment
phase,
they
find
that
it
was
not
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
evidence
thus
far
shows
it
was
especially
cruel.
in
addition,
they
also
went
on
to
find
it
has
not
been
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
especially
heinous
or
depraved.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
in
their
first
opinion,
poland
i.
in
remanding
the
case
for
a
new
trial,
they
do
admonish
the
trial
judge
or
suggest
to
him
that
if
the
poland
boys
are
found
guilty
next
time,
you
may
consider
pecuniary
gain
in
that
the
offense
was
committed
in
the
expectation
of
or
consideration
for
the
receipt
of
something
of
value.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
yes.
they
found
like
in
mr.
rumsey,
judge
coulter
in
rumsey
i
found...
he
didn't
agree
with
the
law
as
then
interpreted.
our
trial
occurred
and
sentencing
before
state
v.
clark
which
was,
i
believe,
july
of
1980,
and
the
opinion
released
in
september.
the
initial
sentence
on
poland
was
in
april.
but
he
did
find
that
this
was
not
pecuniary
gain.
he
considered
it
limited
to
the
contract
type
killing,
but
if
we
were
to
consider
pecuniary
gain
as
more
broad,
then
they
did
receive
something
of
value,
$281,000.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
no,
that
was
the
supreme
court's...
oh,
yes,
that
was
the
trial
judge's
ruling.
then
it
goes
to
the
supreme
court,
and
then
that
is
when
they
find
that
the
one
aggravating
circumstance
found
by
the
trial
judge
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
but
he
made
error
on
the
other
one
or...
not
error,
misinterpreted
the
law.
the
case
comes
back
to
trial.
they
are
again
convicted.
another
aggravating,
mitigating
hearing,
and
this
time
in
the
case
of
petitioner
patrick
poland
there
are
three
aggravating
circumstances
found.
in
the
interim
while
his
case
was
on
appeal
he
was
convicted
of
another
offense
in
phoenix,
arizona,
in
federal
court,
an
armed
robbery,
and
that
was
used
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
under
e-2.
in
addition,
they
found
that
both
petitioners
had
committed
this
crime
for
pecuniary
gain,
and
in
spite
of
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
the
first
time
around,
the
trial
court
also
found
it
was
especially
heinous,
cruel
and
depraved.
mitigating
circumstance,
we
lost
one.
they
had
close
family
ties,
but
they
did
not
have
good
character.
their
character
was
false,
in
that
they
were
deceptive
and
had
committed
a
crime.
the
appeal
goes
up
the
second
time
on
poland
ii.
one
of
the
issues,
and
the
only
issue
we
are
concerned
with,
is
the
double
jeopardy
question.
the
arizona
supreme
court
found
that
it
did
not
offend
double
jeopardy,
and
they
did
not
agree,
nor
shall
any
person
be
subject
for
a
same
offense
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
what
is
the
purpose
of
double
jeopardy?
it
has
got
many
concepts,
and
it
depends
on
what
direction
the
case
and
the
posture
of
it
is
coming
out.
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
double
jeopardy
is,
mr.
prosecutor,
you
get
one
fair,
full
chance
to
present
your
evidence,
and
if
you
do,
fine,
and
if
you
don't,
you
want
another
second
bite
at
the
apple,
then
that
is
when
this
veil
of
double
jeopardy
comes
down
upon
the
petitioner.
why
does
double
jeopardy
apply
in
this
particular
case?
it
boils
down
to
really
maybe
a
hard
question
to
answer
but
a
simple
issue.
what
we
have
is
trial
error
detrimental
to
the
state,
prejudicial
to
the
state
in
that
the
judge
should
have
found
pecuniary
gain
the
first
time
around
but
he
didn't.
then
we
have
another
trial
error,
which
would
be
detrimental
to
the
petitioners,
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
it
didn't
apply
to
the
law.
just
like
in
rumsey,
when
judge
coulter
said,
i
don't
agree
with
the
way
the
law
is
being
interpreted.
i
don't
agree
with
that,
and
i
don't...
it
is
stated
in
matson.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
no.
right.
at
that
time
state
v.
clark
had
not
come
out,
as
cited
by
the
trial
lawyers
in
their
memorandum
sentencing...
i
believe
it
is
march
the
25th
of
1980.
they
cite
several
cases
that
have
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
that
involve
pecuniary
gain,
just
as
mr.
rumsey
involved
pecuniary
gain.
he
was
convicted
of
robbery,
which
was
not
set
aside,
but
it
was
there.
the
law
as
interpreted
at
the
trial
level
was
one
of
reading
special
aggravating
circumstance
e4
and
e5
as
a
combination,
e4
being
the
man
who
hires
the
contract
type
killing,
e5
the
man
who
performs
it
or
maybe
someone
who
would
kill
for
inheritance
or
something
like
that.
the
argument
at
the
first
sentencing
hearing
before
judge
rosenblatt,
petitioner's
counsel
were
exclusively
directing
their
argument
to
the
status
of
the
law
and
trying
to
understand
what
it
was,
and
in
their
memorandum
they
went
to
great
length
and
cite
other
jurisdictions
on
how
they
handled
it.
in
fact,
even
the
state's
memorandum
thought
maybe
this
might
be
limited
to
the
mafia-type
killing,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
and
then
he
did
argue
they
planned
this
job
as
the
evidence
in
the
trial
had
shown,
and
the
drivers
did
die,
therefore
they
received
pecuniary
gain.
jeopardy.
petitioners'
position
is,
jeopardy
attached.
we
had
a
sentence.
we
had
a
hearing.
and
we
had
death
pronounced.
petitioner
now
goes
up
to
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
hit
a
hole
in
one.
insufficient
evidence,
not
showing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
only
aggravating
circumstance,
especially
heinous,
cruel
and
depraved,
and
each
one
of
those
would
constitute
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
the
disjunctive
to
warrant
death
penalty
was
not
proven.
petitioners
rely
on
burkes
as
cited
in
the
brief.
we
rely
upon
green
v.
massey,
which
applied
burkes
to
the
state.
and
then
we
also
rely
on
hudson
v.
louisiana.
the
purpose
there
of
hudson
was
to
show
that
it
didn't
mean
any
evidence,
but
it
has
not
been
shown
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
those
cases
would
show
that
the
status
of
the
petitioner's
case
when
the
arizona
supreme
court
ruled
in
poland
i
is
what
can
be
done
from
here.
there
is
insufficient
evidence.
the
only
way
we
can
cure
this
is
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial
on
death
penalty.
enter
mr.
bullington.
mr.
bullington
was
convicted,
the
only
distinction
being
bullington
and
rumsey
didn't
receive
death.
the
double
jeopardy,
we
are
not
talking
merits
of
the
case.
we
are
talking
whether
that
veil
is
there
or
not
and
whether
or
not
it
requires
a
new
trial.
bullington
tells
us
that
there
are
two
separate
trials,
one
on
guilt
and
one
on
innocent,
i
mean,
on
punishment.
the
one
on
punishment
is
independent
of
the
one
on
guilt.
because
of
the
constitutional
change
mr.
bullington
received
a
new
guilt
trial,
entitled
to
a
different
panel
of
the
jury,
but
they
couldn't
retry
him
on
punishment,
and
this
court
so
held.
further,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
interpreting
its
own
law
in
rumsey
ii
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
double
jeopardy
applies
to
arizona's
death
sentencing
procedure.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
yes,
justice.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
based
on
insufficient
evidence
to
support
one
aggravating
circumstance--
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
--trial
error.
trial
error
prejudicial
to
who?
the
state.
the
state
had
their
opportunity
to
present
their
evidence
to
convince
that
court
that
pecuniary
gain
did
apply
just
as
whoever
the
trial
lawyer
was
in
state
v.
park,
which
convinced
that
court,
and
it
came
up
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
find
that
pecuniary
gain
is
not
limited
to
the
hired
gun.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
it
requires
a
new
hearing.
rumsey
was
the
same
problem.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
that
is
the
only
distinction.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
we
have
the
distinction
that
both
rumsey
and
bullington
received
life.
the
double
jeopardy
is
not
defined
in
terms
of
the
merits
of
the
issue
or
of
the
case.
does
double
jeopardy
apply
to
this
factual
situation?
what
is
necessary
after
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
entered
its
opinion
in
1982,
poland
i,
what
is
necessary
now
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
well,
first
of
all,
they
have
got
to
reconvict
the
polands.
then,
second
of
all,
they
have
got
to
have
an
aggravating
mitigating
hearing,
which
they
did
have.
it
calls
for
a
new
proceeding,
a
second
proceeding.
why
are
we
having
a
second
proceedings
on
the
death
penalty
on
the
polands,
whereas
we
don't
have
a
second
proceedings
on
mr.
bullington,
because
bullington
got
life
the
first
time.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
we
have
what
is
tantamount
to
an
acquittal
is
by
the
ruling
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
poland
i.
that
was
not
an
explicit
acquittal
as
one
would
phrase
mr.
rumsey's--
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
--but
it
was
an...
acquittal.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
if
i
recall
burke
correctly,
i
believe
there
was
not
a
sufficient
prosecution
of
the
evidence
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
the
insanity
type
defense.
they
had
presented
a
record
on
insanity,
and
the
government
had
come
back
in
and
overcome
that
presumption,
so
not
talking
merits
of
the
case
or
100
percent
free
trial
for
the
government.
do
they
get
a
perfect
trial,
or
is
it
under
our
system
there
are
so
many
protections
granted
to
a
defendant
that
we
require
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
criminal
cases,
and
the
same
principle
would
apply
here.
why
should
the
government
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple?
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
yes,
justice,
but
there
is
one
little
problem.
the
trial
lawyer
for
the
polands,
if
you
will
read
their
memorandum
and
likewise
the
sentencing
hearing,
they
are
arguing
the
law
on
this.
they
are
saying
this
doesn't
apply
because
this
is
not
a
contract
killing.
they
didn't
present
or
address
the
issue
like
in
consideration
of
or
in
the
expectation
of.
now,
what
is
the
fine
technical
meaning
of
those
words?
our
court
has
in
clark
explained
it.
one
could
feasibly
argue
that
this
is
different
from
clark.
the
guards
disappeared,
and
that
van
disappeared
some
time
early
on
may
the
24th.
the
van
was
found
the
next
morning
at
about
6:30
in
the
morning,
locked,
in
a
desolate
area
of
yavapai
county
about
halfway
between
phoenix
and
the
little
village
of
prescott,
where
their
first
deliveries
were
to
be
made.
there
is
the
van,
locked.
they
could
get
into
it.
there
was
some
money
there,
but
most
of
it
is
gone.
where
are
the
guards?
a
day
passes.
a
week.
the
guards'
bodies
surface
approximately
a
month
later
and
a
week
apart.
i
say
surface.
they
are
found
floating
in
lake
mead
a
month
later.
was
their
killing
in
consideration
or
in
expectation
of
pecuniary
gain,
or
if
you
are
in
another...
like
some
other
states
have
statutes
and
aggravating
circumstances
where
if
you
are
going
to
dispose
of
a
witness
to
this
crime,
that
constitutes
an
aggravating
circumstance.
do
we
take
every
feasible
situation
and
try
to
squeeze
it
into
pecuniary
gain?
the
trial
lawyer
argued
strictly
from
the
standpoint
of
the
law
on
the
issue,
that
it
is
limited
to
the
hired
gun.
you
have
got
to
read
four
and
five
together.
so
the
misinterpretation
of
the
law
if
one
wants
to
characterize
it
as
such
was
really
a
common
interpretation
made
across
the
state
of
arizona.
this
death
penalty
was
passed
in
1973.
here
we
are,
july
of
1980,
before
we
get
to
the
clark
case
for
an
interpretation
that
it
is
not
limited.
what
is
necessary
again
is
a
multiple
trial.
you
have
got
to
have
another
hearing
on
this,
and
as
a
result
of
that
second
hearing,
the
polands'
lost
ground.
they
lost
their
good
character
in
the
interim.
the
same
evidence.
what
new
occurred?
the
next
point
would
be
that
the
weight
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
establish
the
one
pecuniary
gain
found
by
the
cruel,
heinous,
and
depraved
found
by
the
arizona
court
based
on
a
reading
of
richmond
and
likewise
in
watson.
the
arizona
court
in
looking
at
an
aggravating
circumstance
doesn't
weigh
the
evidence
as
perhaps
the
florida
court
does,
where
they
have
zandt
v.
green
and
their
earlier
cases,
where
if
the
evidence
was
so
tenuous
it
wouldn't
support
this
conviction.
we
have
the
right
as
a
judge
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
and
have
a
new
hearing.
arizona,
we
looked
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
to
support
this
aggravating,
and
we
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
mitigating
circumstance.
then
the
court
would
weigh
these
in
their
independent
reviews,
one
against
another,
and
then
their,
of
course...
review.
certainly
as
far
as
one
of
the
statements...
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
relying
upon
their
decision
in
poland
ii
and
saying
we
do
not
agree,
they
refer
to
a
case
called
knapp
v.
carwell,
which
is
an
unusual
case.
knapp
v.
carwell
results
from
an
earlier
case
which
was
called
state
v.
watson,
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
arizona
death
penalty
that
was
involved
here
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
by
judicial
interpretation
they
found
that
the
statute
wasn't
unconstitutional.
this
was
an
answer
in
regard
to
lockett
v.
ohio.
they
go
through
this
case
and
one
thing
they
find
is
that
double
jeopardy
doesn't
apply
in
the
watson
case,
because
its
resentencing
is
ameliorating.
who
has
been
damaged
by
limiting
mitigating
circumstances?
only
the
petitioner.
subsequently,
when
this
gets
cleared
up,
and
then
we
get
a
class
action
of
all
the
people
down
on
death
row,
it
goes
into
the
federal
court.
they
in
that
time,
in
making
their
decision
to
the
ninth
circuit,
compare
arizona's
procedure
to
missouri,
and
they
find
a
big
distinction
at
that
point,
because
it
involved
a
judge
in
bullington...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
yes,
the
judge
in
bullington
and
vice
versa.
in
bullington
the
jury
determines
it,
but
in
arizona
the
judge
does
it.
that
was
the
distinction.
and
in
addition,
they
found
that
the
sentencing
procedure
is
ameliorative,
that
these
people
haven't
started
serving
their
death
sentence,
so
double
jeopardy
does
not
apply,
and
further,
one
case
out
of
that
whole
group
presents
an
issue
somewhat
compatible
with
the
issue
here,
and
that
was
mr.
valencia.
mr.
valencia
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
on
murder,
and
then
he
had
been
resentenced
pursuant
to
watson
before
the
court
heard
knapp
v.
carwell.
mr.
valencia,
due
to
the
publicity
of
his
first
conviction,
had
a
lady
come
into
the
tucson
port
and
indicate
she
had
been
raped
by
that
man,
and
so
there
was
a
subsequent
trial
on
that.
he
was
convicted,
and
then
when
he
was
resentenced
per
lockett
and
arizona's
watson,
they
brought
up
this
second
new
aggravating
circumstance,
but
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
light
of
our
finding
that
watson
changed
in
interpretation
his
procedural
and
ameliorative,
that
bullington
is
distinguishable,
and
we
hold
double
jeopardy
does
not
apply.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.k.
wilhelmsen
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
the
issue
has
been
clearly
drawn.
we
have
error
that
was
prejudicial
to
the
government.
does
that
guarantee
the
government
a
new
trial?
are
they
entitled
to
a
perfect
trial?
burkes
tells
us
that
the
case
should
be
over,
and
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner...
excuse
me,
the
respondent,
the
issue
of
jeopardy
attaches,
and
that
would
be
at
the
start
of
the
trial.
does
it
ever
terminate?
or
could
it
go
back
a
third
time
and
have
a
third
sentencing
if
we
found
a
flaw
prejudicial
to
the
government?
it
is
submitted
to
this
court
that
the
error
prejudicial
to
the
government
does
not
entitle
them
to
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
and
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
am
through.
