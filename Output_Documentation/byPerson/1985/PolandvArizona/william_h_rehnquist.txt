rehnquist
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
mr.
wilhelmsen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
trial
court
had
said
something
about
that
the
first
time
around.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
before
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
the
first
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
trial
court
find
sufficient
facts
to
meet
the
definition
of
pecuniary
gain
in
the
arizona
statute
the
first
time
out?
he
just
didn't
think
those
facts
met
the
legal
definition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
the
trial
court
the
first
time
around
to
say
i
don't
agree
with
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
there
would
have
been
no
decision
from
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
are
correct
in
it,
why
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
accept
the
trial
court's
conditional
finding
of
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
the
first
time
around?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
reversed
the
convictions
themselves,
not
the
penalties.
is
that
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
