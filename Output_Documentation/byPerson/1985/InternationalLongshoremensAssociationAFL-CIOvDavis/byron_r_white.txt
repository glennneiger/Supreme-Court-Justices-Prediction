justice
byron
r.
white
--but
there
has
to...
don't
you
think
there
has
to
be
some
opportunity
to
get
the
arguable
question
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
this
plaintiff
have
proceeded
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
files
it...
he
files
it
under...
he
files
against
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
against
the
union?
his
suit
is
for
misrepresentation.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
a
union
misrepresentation
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
what...
how
can
you
possibly
argue
that
this
plaintiff
should
be
foreclosed
from
a
state
court
suit
when
there
is
no
way
that
he
could
get
any
remedy
against
the
union
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
way
down
the
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
was
there
a
collective
bargaining
contract?
there
wasn't
a
collective
bargaining
contract
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
against...
only
against
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
say
that
the
only...
under
our
cases,
that
the
board
is
the
only
agency
that
is
entitled
to
decide
whether
somebody
is
a
supervisor
or
an
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
entrusted,
it
is
entitled
to
decide
it,
that's
right,
but
exclusive
of
any
other
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
this
employee,
this
superintendent,
had
gone
to
the
board
saying
i
was
illegally
fired,
i
was
an
employee,
and
he
files
it
with
the
regional
director,
the
regional
director
says
you're
a
supervisor,
friend;
you
have
no
protection,
and
he
appeals
it
to
the
general
counsel,
the
general
counsel
says
the
same
thing.
then
he
sues
the
union,
he
sues
the
union
and
he
says
misrepresentation.
but
for
him
to
win,
the
jury
has
got
to
find
that
he
was
a
supervisor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
then...
wouldn't
you
then
say
that
the
state
court...
certainly
you
think
it
is
bound
by
what
the
board
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but...
yes.
but
you
certainly
would
say
that
you
would
not
be
collaterally
estopped,
wouldn't
you?
now--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
mean,
the
only
way
that
a
collateral
estoppel
issue
could
come
up
is
if
you
brought
it
up,
and
the
only...
and
if
you
say
the
court
could,
the
state
court
could
adjudicate
it,
it
can
adjudicate
whether
somebody
is
a
supervisor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
would
be
the
issue,
the
state
court
would
have
to
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
a
supervisor
or
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
once
the
board's
opportunity
to
decide
it
has
been
exhausted.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if...
what
if
these
gentlemen
had
gone
to
this,
had
gone
to
a
lawyer,
had
gone
out
and
hired
a
lawyer
and
said
can
we
organize,
and
the
lawyer
says
of
course
you
can
organize,
but
if
you
are
a
supervisor,
you
have
no
protection.
but
i
don't
think
you're
a
supervisor
at
all.
i
think
you're
an
employee.
if
you're
fired,
i
can
get
your
job
back
for
you.
this
is
just
a
private
attorney.
and
they
persist
in
organization
and
they
get
canned,
just
like
they
did
here,
and
he
sues
the
lawyer,
sues
the
lawyer
for
malpractice,
claiming
that
he
gave
him
very
bum
advice,
and
the
issue
then
turns
on
whether
he
was...
whether
there
was
any
grounds
for
thinking
he
was
a
supervisor
or
an
employee.
now,
do
you
think
that
state
court
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
have
to
say
sorry,
take
the
supervisor
question
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
there
a
difference
between
the
union
and
that
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
cuts
both
ways,
too,
doesn't
it
then?
i
mean,
you
mean
because
they
have
a
section
7
interest,
they
are
completely...
they
have
no
duty
to
avoid
misrepresentation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
you
sole
answer
to
my...
to
you
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
a
union
and
that
lawyer
i
was
talking
about
a
while
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
would
have
to
extend
that,
those
cases,
to
this
situation,
to
say
malice.
you
have
to
have
malice
for
punitive
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
surprised
that
they
didn't
at
least
mention
your
linn
argument
if
you
had
made
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
the
defense
wasn't
waived
and
the
preemption
issue
here,
you
think
the
state
court
has
actually
decided
the
issue,
and
that
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
also
then
have
to
face
the
preemption
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
were
wrong
on
that,
however,
i
take
it
that
the
alabama
law
would
be
that
you
could
raise
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
issue
at
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
they
were
wrong
as
to
whether
they
thought
preemption
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
issue.
suppose
it
was
actually,
and
if
they
had
thought
it
was,
they
would
have
let
it
be
raised
at
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
there
is,
there
is
a
type
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
alabama
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
they
had
thought
preemption
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
would
not
have
been
waived
by
failure
to
raise
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
answer
to
the...
are
you
familiar
with
the
curry
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
question
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
ahead.
you
proceed
at
your
own
pace.
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
their
story
also
was
that
they
didn't
say
that
we
will
get
your
job
back
if
you're
fired.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
well,
i
know,
but
their
story
was
that
they
said
that
if
it
turns
out
you're
a
supervisor,
why,
you
can
be
fired.
that
was
part
of
their
story.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
was
part
of
their
story.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the
submission
to
the
regional
director
which
was
unappealed
sort
of
ends
the
matter
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
question?
is
rejection
of
the
claim
by
the
regional
director
and
failure
to
appeal
it
to
the
general
counsel,
does
that
have
the
same
effect
as
though
the
general
counsel
had
agreed
with
the
regional
supervisor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
on
their
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
did
they
appeal
directly
to
the
alabama
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
then...
did
the
union
then
claim
that
this
gentleman
was
not
a
supervisor?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
even
though
they
had
conceded
it,
you
say,
in
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
alabama
supreme
court
didn't,
because
of
their
disposition,
didn't
discuss
supervisor
or
not,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
an
employer
seeks
to
get
an
injunction
against
a
union
on
the
grounds
that
it's...
he's
picketing
to
get
representation
when,
at
a
time
when
he
shouldn't,
when
it
shouldn't,
and
the
state
court
issues
an
injunction
against
the
picketing,
and
against
the
argument
that
this
is
an
arguable
unfair
labor
practice,
and
comes
up
here
and
we
say
that
the
state
court
should
not
have
issued
the
injunction
at
all,
and
we
say
we
reverse
the
judgment
below
as
beyond
the
power
of
the
georgia
courts.
consequently,
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction
or
to
adjudicate
this
controversy
which
lay
within
the
exclusive
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
of
course,
this
is
one
of
the
cases
on
which
the
argument
is
based
that
this
is
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
cite
curry
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
correct.
right.
you
know,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
indicate
whether
he
was
a
supervisor
or
not,
but
they
very
clearly
did
in
their
footnote
3,
their
footnote
2,
rather,
on
page
3
of
their
opinion,
they
definitely
assume
he
was
a
supervisor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
this
plaintiff
had
any
remedy
before
the
board
against
the
union,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
remedy
he
had
was
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
you
had
cited
it,
the
opposition
might
have
had
a
good
response
to
it.
