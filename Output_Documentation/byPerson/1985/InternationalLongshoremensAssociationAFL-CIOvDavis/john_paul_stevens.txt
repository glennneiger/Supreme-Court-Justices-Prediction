mr.
goldburg,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
kind
preemption
it
is?
in
other
words,
some
of
the
cases
we
say
there
is
actual...
it's
actually
prohibited
or
actually
protected,
and
others
arguably
prohibited
and
arguably
protected.
would
you
say
that
the
matter,
even
if
it's
just
arguably
protected
or
prohibited,
that
it
still
defeats
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
the
state
part?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
take
that
view,
supposing
you
had
a
case
in
which
you
had
an
arguable
remedy
before
the
labor
board
so
that
you
can't
go
forward
in
the
state
court,
and
the
party
went
before
the
labor
board
and
then
lost
and
determined
that
it
no
longer
was
arguably
prohibited?
would
then
jurisdiction
be
revived
in
the
state
court
or
would
it
still
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
a
temporary
total
foreclosure
of
jurisdiction
rather
than
just
sort
of
a
defer
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldburg,
could
i
go
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i'm
still
trying
to
think
your
position
through.
supposing
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
yet
run
on
a
state
cause
of
action
that
is...
that
there's
an
arguable
remedy
before
the
labor
board,
and
so
they
file
suit
and
you
come
in
and
dismiss
and
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
and
the
employee
goes
ahead
before
the
labor
board.
could
the
state
court
keep
the
case
pending
in
order
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
under
your
view
would
it
have
an
absolute
duty
to
dismiss
the
case
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
prejudice,
and
then,
i
take
it,
if
they
then
come
back
later
after
losing
before
the
labor
board,
you
would
be
able
to
plead
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
a
technical
ground.
it's
one
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
said
what
they
would
do
if
they
did
reach
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
