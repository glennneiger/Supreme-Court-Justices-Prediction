justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
is
your
submission,
mr.
goldburg,
that
a
defense
like
this
could
have
been
raised
even
for
the
first
time
on
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
if
the
judgment
had
finally
become
final,
could
you
collaterally
attack
the
judgment
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
got
the
impression
from
your
brief
that
some
of
your
arguments
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction
were
based
on
the
idea
that
it
can
be
raised,
or
based
on
cases
arising
in
the
federal
courts.
why
should
those
be
carried
over
to
a
state
court
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
answered
that
by
saying
that
our
trial
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
have
jurisdiction
to
try
in
this
representation
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
term...
does
the
garmon
case
use
the
term
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
why
do
you
use
the
term
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
know
why
this
point
wasn't
raised
until
after
trial
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't...
well,
i
suppose
the
alabama
courts
could
look
at
it
as
an
effort
to
get
a
favorable
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
if
you
don't
get
that,
then
you
raise
this
point
afterward.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
agree
that
it's
perfectly
possible,
i
suppose,
the
union
could
win
the
case
before
the
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
be
a
rather
strange
rule
of
law
to
require
a
trial
court
to
raise
an
issue
that
a
party
was
in
a
far
better
position
to
raise
than
the
trial
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
presumably,
you
know,
you
have
your
typical
generalist
trial
court
judge
has
to
be
familiar
with
a
number
of
different
areas
of
law,
to
expect
him
to
raise
it
when
a
party
in
whose
interest
it
is
to
raise
it
doesn't
know
enough
to
raise
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
rule.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
rather
scant
relief.
the
man
says
i
have
a
complaint
against
the
union
for
misrepresentation,
and
you
say,
well,
you've
got
a
remedy
against
the
company
for
something
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
it
is
scant
relief,
i
suggest,
to
a
plaintiff
who
says
i
have
a
complaint
for
misrepresentation
against
b
to
tell
him,
well,
you
can't
sue
b
for
misrepresentation
but
you
can
sue
a
for
something
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
assume
that
alabama
feels
it
has
a
concern
to
protect
its
people
against
misrepresentation,
and
part
of
that
is
making
plaintiffs
whole,
but
part
of
it
is
mulcting
defendants
and
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
raise
this
argument
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
pass
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
say
at
the
end
of
their
opinion,
we
have
carefully
reviewed
the
appellant's
alternative
state
law
grounds
for
reversal
and
find
each
of
them
to
be
without
merit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
matters
does
the
alabama
supreme
court
consider
to
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction
so
far
as
the
circuit
courts
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
circuit
court
have
a
limited
jurisdiction
moneywise?
