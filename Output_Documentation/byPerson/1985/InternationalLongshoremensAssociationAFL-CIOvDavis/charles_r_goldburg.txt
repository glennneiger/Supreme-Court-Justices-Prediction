mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
ila
attempted
to
organize
a
group
of
ship
superintendents,
and
the
union
is
alleged
to
have
told
the
men
it
could
get
them
their
jobs
back
if
they
were
fired
for
union
activity.
the
first
issue
to
consider
is
whether
the
defense
of
federal
preemption
is
waivable.
in
the
garmon
case,
this
court
said
that
when
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
section
8
of
the
act,
the
states
are
deprived
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
since
the
defense
of
federal
preemption
deprives
the
court,
the
state
court
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
defense
should
be
nonwaivable.
among
the
factors
that
the
court
noted
in
garmon
in
reaching
this
conclusion
is
that
the
lmra
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
congress
created
a
tribunal,
the
national
labor
relations
board,
with
specially
designed
procedures,
and
the
court
recognized
that
a
variety
of
local
procedures
and
attitudes
could
lead
to
inconsistent
adjudications
just
as
easily
as
inconsistent
rules
of
substantive
law.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
judgment
could
be
collaterally
attacked.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
court
has
held
that
subject
matter...
well,
in
a
sense,
it...
i'm
sorry.
the
question
then
would
be
a
matter
of
full
faith
and
credit,
and
i
believe
full
faith
and
credit
does
not
preclude
inquiry
into
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
because
in
garmon
i
believe
that
this
court
held
that
congress
deprived
the
states
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
this
type
of
a
controversy.
congress
took
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
away,
and
therefore
the
states
have
no--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--but
the
fact
that...
well,
i
think
all
states
have
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
if
merely
by
the
state
giving
one
of
its
trial
courts
general
jurisdiction
they
could
overrule
congress
on
a
decision
to
take
subject
matter
jurisdiction
away,
national
labor
policy
would
be
frustrated.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
it
says
jurisdiction?
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well,
i
think
that's
the
only
jurisdiction
that
the
court
could
have
been
talking
about
because
the
court
was
very
concerned
with
a
variety
of
local
procedures
being
applied
by
the
states
and
a
variety
of
attitudes
being
possessed
by
the
states
on
labor
controversies,
and
i
think
the
only
way
that
congress
could
ensure
that
these
types
of
issues
were
submitted
to
the
board
and
that
the
conduct
that
congress
intended
to
be
protected
under
section
7
would
be
protected
would
be
if
state
courts
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
type
of
controversy.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
i
think
it
was
purely
inadvertence.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
strategic
motivation.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
but
i
just
don't
see
how
we
can
infer
a
strategic
motivation
because
we...
you
say
favorable
judgment.
it
was
a
jury
trial.
it
wasn't
like
the
union
was
hoping
there
would
be
a
favorable
decision
written.
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--well,
if
the
defense
of
federal
preemption
had
not
been
upheld,
say,
on
a
pretrial
motion,
they
still
would
have
gotten
a
jury
trial.
i
just
don't
see
any
reason
for
a
union
or
the
lawyer
who
was
trying
the
case
to
hold
back
on
a
defense
and
risk
waiver.
i
mean,
if
they
had
thought
of
the
defense,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
risked
waiver.
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
the
trial
court
to
raise
federal
preemption
on
its
own,
sua
sponte,
because
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
show
that
the
alleged
misrepresentation
arose
from
organizational
activity.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well,
under
the
alabama
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
court
is
to
raise
subject
matter
jurisdiction
sua
sponte.
it's
the
same
as
the
federal
rules
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
but
i
think
this
court
said
in
lockridge
that
the
court
designed
the
arguably
protected
standard
so
state
trial
courts
could
very
easily
police
themselves
in
this
area.
they
don't
have
to
be
right
because
if
they
make
the
wrong
decision,
the
issue
will
go
to
the
state
appeals
court
or
ultimately
this
court
on
appeal,
but
they
can
satisfy
any
interest
in
efficiency,
in
integrity
and
in
finality
of
the
trial
court
proceeding
by
raising
the
issue
sua
sponte.
indeed,
in
this
particular
case
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
waste
of
trial
time
at
all
because
the
alabama
supreme
court
indicates
in
its
opinion
that
even
if
they
didn't
think
the
defense
was
waivable,
they
don't
think
federal
preemption
applies
on
the
merits,
and
it's
clear
from
that
that
even
if
the
defense
had
been
raised
say,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
trial
court
had
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
have
sent
the
case
back
for
trial
because
they
said
in
their
footnote
they
didn't
think
it
was
preempted.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
justice
stevens,
as
i
read
garmon,
the
same
standard
applies
for
arguable
or
actual.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes,
i
think
once
there
has
been
a
clear
determination
by
the
labor
board,
not
just
the
regional
director,
by
at
least
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board,
once
there
has
been
a
clear
determination,
that
supervisors
are
involved,
i
believe
at
that
point
that
the
states
could
apply
their
law,
that
they
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--he
could
have
filed
a
charge
under
section
8(a)(1)
or
section
8(a)(3)--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--that
his
discharge
was
coercive,
that
is,
that
the
other
superintendents
in
the
unit
were
discouraged--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--yes,
file
against
the
company
under
8(a)(1)
or
8(a)(3).
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes,
but--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--a
union
misrepresentation
can
generally
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
concede
that
this
particular
representation
could
not
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
simple
reason
this
was
a
representation--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--well,
if
he
had
followed
his
procedure
before
the
board,
he
wouldn't
have
needed
a
remedy
as
far
as
the
ila
was
concerned.
if
the
board
had
found
that
he
was
an
employee,
the
board
could
have
reinstated
him
with
back
pay.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
board
had
found
that
he
was
not
an
employee,
i
believe
at
that
point
he
would
have
had
a
remedy
against
the
union.
however,
at
that
point
we
reach
our
argument
that
the
alabama
claim
of
its
strict
liability
should
be
preempted
at
that
point,
and
that
once
there
has
been
a
finding
that
he
is
a
supervisor
rather
than
an
employee,
i
think
a
malice
standard
should
apply
in
terms
of
the
representation
that
you
would
make.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes.
we
are
talking
about
misrepresentation
which
is,
granted,
a
law
of
general
application
here,
but
the
court
has
held
that
state
tort
law
can
be
preempted
because
tort
law
is
indeed
a
method
of
controlling
policy.
the
ila
was
engaged
in
organizational
activity
so
we
are
at
the
core
purpose
of
the
lmra.
the
section
7
includes
the
right
of
union
officials
to
discuss
organization
with
employees.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well,
my
view
is
they
would
have
to
dismiss
the
case
without
prejudice
since
they
wouldn't
have
any
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well,
i...
many
states
have
an
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
that
type
of
a
situation
where,
say
that
the
first
action
is
dismissed
on
a
technical
ground
that
doesn't
make--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--but
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
addressed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
it's
not
addressed
to
the
question
of
whether
substantively
plaintiff
would
have
had
a
course
of
action
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
so
many
states
have
extensions
of
the
statute
of
limitation
for
that
type
of
situation.
i
believe
my
state
has
a
six
month
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
that
type
of
situation.
we
are
involved
with
organizational
activity.
it
is
important
for
the
union
to
be
able
to
solicit
argual
employees
in
this
type
of
situation
so
that
the
employees
can
learn
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
organization
from
others.
in
the
hanna
mining
case,
this
court
held
that,
or
it
was
stated
that
organizing
supervisors
is
not
even
arguably
protected,
but
in...
the
critical
distinction
in
hanna
mining,
there
had
been
a
clear
determination
that
supervisors
were
involved,
there
had
been
an
appeal
from
the
regional
director
to
general
counsel.
there
has
been
no
clear
determination
in
the
present
case,
and
therefore
these
people
are
arguably
employees.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
no,
the
parties
did
not
proceed
to
the
point
of
collective
bargaining
although
the
superintendents
signed
authorization
cards;
the
union
never
got
to
the
point
of
sitting
down
with
the
employer,
perhaps
once
the
coercive
discharges
of
davis
and
trione
took
place,
the
organizational
drive
really
fell
apart.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
state
interest
in
applying
its
law
is
exceedingly
weak.
the
superintendents,
after
all,
made
a
section
7
decision
that
they
would
affiliate
with
the
union
and
authorize
the
union
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
for
them.
obviously
the
state
of
alabama
has
no
interest
in
regulating
this
section
7
decision
that
the
superintendents
made.
the
state
also
has
a
very
little
interest
here
in
protecting
the
employment
relationship
of
these
people
that
were
fired
for
union
activities
because
the
alabama
state
law
is
that
it
is
a
hiring
at
will,
and
the
employer
could
fire
them
for
really
any
reason
whatsoever.
the
statement
that
was
allegedly
made
by
the
union
that
the
superintendents
could
get
their
job
back
embodies
with
it
an
opinion
that
the
men
are
being
told
that
they
are
employees
rather
than
supervisors.
based
on
the
federal
policy
of
free
debate
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
linn
and
austin
cases,
i
believe
these
type
of
opinion
statements
should
be
protected.
further,
section
8(c)
of
the
act
which,
although
by
its
terms
it
applies
to
written
communications,
i
think
goes
on
to
say
that
views,
arguments
or
opinions
are
not
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
therefore
should
be
arguably
protected.
in
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
the
plaintiff
did
not
seek
his
remedy
before
the
nlrb.
instead,
he
filed
a
state
misrepresentation
action
in
which
an
essential
element
of
the
cause
of
action
was
the
falsity
of
the
representation
on
the
part
of
the
ila.
the
jury
had
to
find
that
davis
was
in
fact
a
supervisor
to
conclude
that
the
representation
that
the
ila
made
was
false.
now,
this
issue,
whether
or
not
the
man
was
a
supervisor,
has
been
entrusted
to
the
nlrb.
davis
could
have
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
under
section
8(a)(1)
or
8(a)(3).
if
he
was
an
employee,
the
discharge
by
the
employer
was
coercive
or
discriminatory.
now,
as
a
result,
what
is
implicated
here
is
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb.
if
this
is
a
section
7
case,
we
claim
arguable
protection;
however,
we
also
implicate
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
rule
on
this
employee-supervisor
question.
since
davis
could
have
invoked
board
jurisdiction,
the
sears
case
is
distinguishable
because
sears
turned
on
the
inability
of
the
aggrieved
party
to
seek
board
jurisdiction.
here
the
supposedly
aggrieved
party
could
have
sought
board
jurisdiction
and
could
have
gotten
a
ruling--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--yes.
the
board
could
only
grant
damages
against
the
company,
but
if
the
court
granted
damages,
he
wouldn't
need
a
remedy
as
far
as
the
ila
was
concerned.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
believe
it's
scant
relief
at
all.
it
is
a
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
i
think
that's
everything.
i
mean,
this
is
a
man
who
himself
is
engaged
in
organizational
activity.
if
the
board
could
reinstate
him
and
give
him
back
pay,
i
think
that's
everything.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
but
if
he
gets
complete
relief,
i
think
that
satisfies
the
state's
concern.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
but
i
don't
think
that
the
state
can
properly
focus
on
the
union's
activity
until
there
has
been
a
clear
determination
that
it's
supervisors
as
opposed
to
employees
that
are--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--well,
in...
there's
a
case,
i
believe
it's
the
perko
case,
that
this
court
said
that
the
issue
is
wisely
entrusted
to
the
nlrb
because--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--well,
as
i
read
hanna
mine
and
also
the
beasley
case
from
this
court...
i
believe
it
is
beasley
v.
food
fair,
i
believe
that
what
the
court
was
saying
there
is
that
the
states
cannot
apply
their
law
to--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--but
at
that
point,
the
court--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--that
is
an
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
which
would
be
up
to
the
state
court
at
that
point.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--my
argument
at
that
point
would
be
that
i
wouldn't
be
collaterally
estopped
by
the
board
determination
because
there
is
no
opportunity
for
judicial
review.
however,
i
will
concede
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned
at
this
point,
that
is
a
matter
of
state
evidentiary
law.
it
really
doesn't
matter
as
far
as
the
issue
of
preemption
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
but
one--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--but
once
there's
been
a
clear
determination,
the
state
only
has
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
that
issue
once
there's
been
a
clear
determination.
in
other
words,
once
the
board
has--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--yes.
and
at
that
point,
once
there
has
been
a
clear
determination,
the
issue
which
is
raised
is
whether
the
state
court
must
apply
a
malice
standard
as
this
court
held
in
linn,
or
whether
this...
or
whether
the
court
would
be
preempted
from
allowing
liability
based
on
a
strict
liability
theory.
in
the
present
case--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--that's
a--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--justice
white,
that's
a
stronger
case
for
the
plaintiff.
perhaps
because--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--because
i
don't
think
there's
a
fiduciary
obligation
between
the
union
and
the
prospective--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--i
don't
believe
that
the...
that
mr.
davis
was
a
member
of
the
union
at
that
point.
he
was
solely
an
employee
that
was
being
solicited
by
the
union
at
that
point.
i
believe
that
the
union
has
a
section
7
interest
in
soliciting
the
employee
at
that
point.
it's
not
a
fiduciary--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--but
because
there's
a
section
7
interest,
the
union
is
entitled
to
more
leeway
than
that
which
an
attorney
would
be.
there
is
no
federal
statute--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--because
there's
a
federal
statutory
right
involved
that
grants
the
union
more
leeway
than
an
attorney
would
have
because
there
is
no
federal
statute
protecting
the
right
to
practice
law.
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
general
verdict,
so
we
can't
tell
whether
the
jury
based
its
verdict
on
malice,
on
intentional
theory
or
on
a
strict
liability
theory,
and
as
a
result,
i
think
that
the
union
should
be
entitled
to
at
very
least
a
new
trial
based
on
the
submission
of
the
strict
liability.
i
also
suggest
that
the
$75,000
verdict
here
was
excessive
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
evidence
was
that
the
man
only
lost
three
months
worth
of
work.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
i
believe
that
there
are
several
cases,
linn
and
farmer,
where
this
court
said
that--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--yes,
but
in
linn
and
farmer,
this
court
also
held
that
the
state
trial
court
must
be
under
a
strict
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
damages
awarded
are
not
excessive,
so
the
excessiveness,
i
believe,
would
be
a
federal
question.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
they
didn't
reach
it
per
se
because
they
felt
that
the
issue
of
federal
preemption
had
been
waived.
so
they
did
not
speak
as
to
the
excessiveness
of
the
verdict.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
well,
i
think
that
in
their
footnote
they
said
that
even
if
the
defense
had
not
been
waived
on
its
merits,
they
didn't
think
that
there
was
any
merit
to
the
defense
of
federal
preemption.
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
that's
correct,
justice
white,
based
on
their
footnote.
does
the
court
have
any
other
questions?
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
first
of
all,
to
respond
to
what
justice
white
asked
on
the
curry
case,
we
should
have
cited
the
curry
case
in
our
brief,
but
i
believe
the
court
said
in
the
curry
case
that
plaintiff
alleged
in
the
complaint
allegations
which
show
that--
mr.
charles
r.
goldburg
--to
respond
to
what
justice
stevens
asked
on
the
statute
of
limitations
problem,
there
is
also
nothing
to
stop
the
state
from
establishing
a
toll
for
administrative
proceedings
of
their
limitations
statute.
my
brother
says
that
federal
constitutional
rights
can
be
waived.
i
think
preemption
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
a
mere
constitutional
violation
because
with
preemption
we
have
the
deprivation
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
believe
that
the
activity
is
arguably
protected
here
regardless
of
whether
the
plaintiff
had
any
remedy
before
the
union
as
far
as
the
board
was
concerned.
if
it
was
just
a
simple
situation
that
the
union
was
engaged
in
organizational
picketing
and
the
employer
went
into
the
state
court,
we
would
be
arguably
protected.
