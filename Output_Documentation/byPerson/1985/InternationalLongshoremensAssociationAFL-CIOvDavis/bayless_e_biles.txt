mr.
bayless
e.
biles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
larry
davis'
position
in
this
case
that
this
court
should
dismiss
this
appeal.
we
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decision
was
based
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
this
court
has
consistently
refused
to
decide
cases
which
rest
upon
state
court
decisions
which
rest
upon
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds.
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
their
opinion
specifically
held
that
they
were
basing
their
opinion
upon
their
interpretation
of
the
alabama
rules
of
civil
procedure,
rule
8(c)
and
upon
a
1983
alabama
case,
powell
v.
phenix
savings
wherein
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
previously
decided
that
federal
preemption
in
alabama
did
not
go
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
if
they
were
wrong
with
respect
to--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--if
we
are
talking
about
the
type
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
cannot
be
waived,
certainly.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
i
would
like
to
take
that
back.
no,
sir.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
cannot
be
waived
in
alabama.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
but
alabama,
as--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--that
is
correct.
but
under--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--those
matters
which
truly
challenge
the
power
of
the
court
to
hear
the
case.
for
instance,
bankruptcy.
you
couldn't
file
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
a
state
court
in
alabama
because
congress
specifically
has
set
bankruptcy
proceedings.
also,
we
have
different
jurisdictional
amounts
in
civil
cases
for
different
courts
in
our
judicial
system
in
alabama,
and
they
recognize
those
type
challenges
as
subject
matter
jurisdiction
challenges.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
no,
sir,
but
if
you
could
give
me
the
facts,
i
would
certainly
try--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--i
was
going
to
address
the
michigan
v.
long
case
which--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--thank
you.
i
was
going
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
decision
was
based
solely
on
alabama
procedure.
this
is
not
michigan
v.
long
where
the
state
court
decision
was
based
upon
two
grounds
and
the
court
went
ahead,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
went
ahead
and
stated
that
it
was
ruling
the
way
it
did
because
of
the
way
it
interpreted
terry
v.
ohio,
which
of
course
was
the
united
states
supreme
court
case
dealing
with
the
united
states
constitution.
in
this
case,
preemption
under
alabama
procedure
was
determined
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
be
an
affirmative
defense
which,
if
not
pleaded,
is
waived.
this,
i
think,
is
supported
by
the
decisions
in
this
court,
the
lockridge
decision.
in
the
lockridge
decision,
this
court
stated
that
when
congress
passed
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
didn't
tell
us
to
what
extent
it
ousted
state
law.
therefore,
we,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
are
not
going
to
hold
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempted
local
regulation
which
in
every
and
any
way
touches
upon
the
complex
relationships
between
unions,
employees
and
employers.
the
court
went
on
to
state,
obviously
much
of
this
is
left
to
the
states.
certainly
when
congress
passed
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
never
expressed
an
intention
to
preempt
state
procedural...
state
procedure.
absent
a
clear
intent
to
preempt
state
procedure,
federal
law
takes
state
courts
where
it
finds
them.
this
court
stated
that
in
brown
v.
gerdes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
judiciary
act,
and
from
the
very
beginning,
we
have
envisioned
that
state
courts
would
adjudicate
state
claims
and
federal
claims
without
the
imposition
of
a
federal
procedural
code.
the
ila
argues
that
preemption
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
that
it
cannot
be
waived.
of
course,
i
have
already
pointed
out
what
this
court
stated
in
lockridge,
that
obviously
much
is
left
to
the
states
in
this
area.
in
the
garmon
case,
the
farmer
case,
the
sears
case,
the
linn
case,
this
court
applied
a
weighing
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
states,
the
interest
that
the
state
was
attempting
to
protect
outweighed
the
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
necessarily
implies
that
state
courts
in
the
first
instance
in
these
situations
have
the
right
to
hear
evidence,
take
testimony,
and
decide
and
decipher
preemption
from
non-preemption
issues.
furthermore,
we
feel
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
how
a
state
court
applies
and
recognizes
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
a
question
of
state
law.
the
alabama
courts,
as
i
have
already
stated,
consider
nonwaivable
only
the
narrow
class
of
true
jurisdictional
objections
such
as
bankruptcy.
it's
truly
amazing
how
the
ila
tried
this
case
below.
they
came
into
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
county,
agreed
to
play
ball
by
the
rules
in
the
circuit
court
of
mobile
county.
they
didn't
object
to
those
rules.
they
didn't
object
to
the
procedural
rules
in
the
state
of
alabama.
and
now
they
stand
before
the
highest
court
in
the
land
and
ask
you
to
give
them
another
shot.
they
never
raised
the
preemption
until
after
the
verdict.
they
raised
it
then
in
a
motion
for
j.n.o.v.
as
ground
number
15
of
16
grounds.
they
waited
approximately
two
years
after
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
before
they
raised
it,
and
they
had
plenty
of
opportunity
under
alabama
procedure
to
raise
it.
they
could
have
raised
it
on
their
motion
to
dismiss.
they
could
have
raised
it
in
their
answer.
they
could
have
amended
their
answer
at
any
time
even
before
the
jury
goes
out
in
alabama
you
can
amend
your
answer.
they
could
have
raised
it
on
summary
judgment.
they
could
have
raised
it
on
directed
verdict.
they
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
they
filed
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
at
the
end
of
my
case,
my
client's
case,
and
also
at
the
end
of
all
the
evidence,
never
mentioned
it,
never
said
one
word
about
it.
there's
no
record
on
preemption.
this
case
wasn't
tried
with
preemption
in
mind.
in
the
herndon
v.
georgia
case,
this
court
recognized
that
a
federal
constitutional
right
can
be
waived
if
it's
not
timely
raised
under
state
procedure,
and
if
it's
not
timely
raised
under
state
procedure
and
it
is
therefore
not
passed
on
below,
this
court
held
in
herndon
v.
georgia
that
it
wouldn't
reach
the
issue.
the
issue
was
not
passed
upon
below.
the
ila
concedes,
as
well
they
conceded
in
their
brief,
they
conceded
to
you
here
today,
that
if
mr.
davis
were
a
supervisor,
there
would
be
no
preemption
and
no
question
about
preemption.
again,
it
is
totally
amazing
how
they
tried
this
case
below.
their
tune
has
completely
changed
since
they
tried
the
case.
they
never
challenged
davis'
supervisory
status
below
in
the
trial
court.
they
never...
they
are
the
ones
who
introduced
the
regional
director's
ruling
with
respect
to
mr.
trione,
mr.
trione
being
a
fellow
ship
superintendent
at
ryan-walsh
like
davis
was.
mr.
trione
was
provided
an
attorney
by
the
ila
when
he
was
fired.
he
wasn't
able
to
bring
his
lawsuit
because
he
had
to
go
bankrupt
before
he
got
to
court.
but
they
hired
him
an
attorney.
the
attorney
filed
a
complaint
just
like
they
were
talking
about
to
seek
to
make
ryan-walsh
reinstate
him.
the
regional
director
ruled
that
he
was
a
supervisor,
had
no
protection
under
the
act.
he
was
represented
at
that
time
by
an
ila
attorney,
no
appeal
taken.
they
introduced
the
ruling
of
the
regional
director
at
the
trial.
they
introduced
trione,
set
up
a
picket
at
their
urgence,
a
one-man
picket.
ryan-walsh
went
down
and
filed
a
preliminary
injunction
against
him.
the
state...
the
circuit
court
in
mobile
county
ruled
again,
mr.
trione,
as
a
ship
superintendent
at
ryan-walsh,
you
are
a
supervisor.
they
at
the
trial
below
asked
the
circuit
judge
to
charge
the
jury
that
supervisors
could
join
unions.
they
didn't
challenge
mr.
trione's
definition
or
delineation
of
ship
superintendent's
duties
that
were
set
out
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
yes,
sir,
that
was
part
of
their
story,
and
it
didn't
go
over
with--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--that
was
mr.
holland's
story.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
it
was
interesting
to
note
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
mr.
holland
also
put
on
two
other
people
who
were
with
the
union
who
were
at
that
infamous
meeting
that
night
who
didn't
remember
that
mr.
holland
said
those
things.
even
his
own
witnesses
didn't
remember
that
mr.
holland
said
those
things.
this
case
was
tried
at
the
trial
court
level
with
the
total
understanding
by
everybody,
including
the
ila,
that
mr.
davis
was
a
supervisor,
that
that
issue
didn't
have
to
be
addressed
by
the
trial
court.
it
was
never
questioned.
now
the
ila
wants
to
say
to
you
that
we
are
arguably
protected
because
this
is
organizational
activity
directed
toward
people
who
are
arguably
employees
under
the
act.
when
you
say
arguably
employees
under
the
act,
that
implies
certainly
that
there
are
some
facts
to
based
that
argument
upon.
there
are
absolutely
no
facts
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
larry
davis
was
anything
other
than
a
statutory
supervisor,
absolutely
no
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
introduced
evidence
that
he
was.
i
couldn't
understand
why
they
were
doing
it
when
they
did
it.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
your
honor,
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
hanna
mining
that
a
final
ruling
by
the
general
counsel
clears
it
up
with
unclouded
legal
significance,
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
in
the
first
instance
you
must
have
that
type
of
question
answered
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
operating--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--that's
not
my
position,
no,
sir.
i
couldn't
say
that.
but
i
can
say
that
this
court
in
operating
engineers
v.
jones
recognized
mr.
jones'
statutory
supervisory
status
even
though
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
never
ruled
on
it
either
way.
also,
in
the
sears
and
garmon
case,
addressing
that
issue
and
addressing
that
question
further,
justice
white,
the
court
recognized
that
if
the
state
courts
in
this
area
can
understand
and
interpret
the
legal
significance
of
acts
under
federal
law
by
applying
compelling
precedent
to
essentially
undisputed
facts,
then
there
is
no
preemption.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
they
did.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
they
did,
just
as
they
are
arguing
to
this
court
today,
that
he
is
arguably
an
employee
when
there
are
absolutely
no
facts
on
the
record
to
support
that
he
was
an
employee.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
no,
sir.
the
alabama
supreme
court
never
reached
that
issue,
stated
that
it
was
not
reaching
the
merits
of
the
issue
at
all.
this
case
went
off
simply
on
the
procedural
ruling
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
are--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--no,
sir,
i
did
not.
there's
no
question
but
that
there
are
situations
where
states
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
type
cases,
but
for
instance,
if
mr.
davis
were
an
employee,
this
case
becomes
a
much
harder
case
for
me.
but
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
he's
a
supervisor.
he's
not
arguably
an
employee,
and
my
answer
would
be
since
he
is
obviously
a
supervisor,
he
has
no
rights
under
this
act.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
yes,
sir,
but
they
never
reached
the
merits
of
the
preemption
issue.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
said
what
they
would
do
if
they
did
reach
it.
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
this
court
further
has
held
in
sears
that
with
respect
to
the
ila's
argument,
and
their
argument
is
that
they
are
arguably
protected,
this
court...
and
i
quote,
if
i
may...
"as
long
as
a
union
has
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
the
protection
issue
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
retains
meaningful
protection
against
risk
of
error
in
state
courts.
"
the
ila
clearly,
whenever
mr.
davis
and
mr.
trione
were
fired,
could
have
filed
a
section
8
complaint
against
ryan-walsh.
at
that
point
in
time
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
have
dealt
with
their
issue
that
they
want
to
bring
to
this
court
today,
their
arguable
protection
issue.
but
they
chose,
and
in
the
words
of
sears,
they
chose
to
avoid
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
because
they
knew
that
they
had
such
a
weak
case,
they
knew
that
the
regional
director
had
already
ruled
that
trione,
who
was
a
fellowship
superintendent,
was
a
supervisor.
they
knew
the
duties
that
these
people
had
as
ship
superintendents.
they
chose
to
avoid
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
and
the
protection
that
was
available
under
the
act
was
available
to
them
if
they
wanted
to
pursue
it,
and
they
chose
to
avoid
it.
furthermore,
we
would
state
that...
let
me--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--no,
sir.
the
only--
mr.
bayless
e.
biles
--that's
the
way
i
read
it,
your
honor.
in
closing,
let
me
state
to
this
court
that
the
ila
committed
many
procedural
defaults
at
the
trial.
they
come,
they
come
to
this
court
and
dress
those
procedural
defaults
in
jurisdictional
language.
they
come
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land
to
ask
you
to
forgive
them
of
their
procedural
defaults.
they
come
here
to
ask
you
to
give
them
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
at
the
expense
of
mr.
davis.
they
waited
almost
two
years
before
they
raised
this
issue.
we
had
gone
through
discovery,
unbelievable
discovery.
i
couldn't
even
take
the
depositions
of
mr.
hollands.
he
wouldn't
bring
himself
into
my
jurisdiction,
and
my
client
couldn't
afford
to
send
me
to
texas.
we
had
to
try
this
case...
we
didn't
know
what
in
the
world
he
was
going
to
say.
we
have
gone
through
all
of
this.
these
people
could
have
raised
this
issue
up
front,
and
if
this
issue
were
dispositive,
we
would
have
done
away
with
this
case.
if
the
issue
weren't
dispositive,
at
least
a
record
could
have
been
built
on
it
so
this
court
could
have
looked
at
the
facts
involved
in
the
case?
the
way
the
record
is
now,
the
trial
court
in
alabama
never
had
to
make
any
decision
with
respect
to
a
supervisor
or
employee.
the
ila
treated
the
man
as
a
supervisor
all
along,
and
there's
no
protection
for
a
supervisor
under
this
case.
i
thank
you
very
much.
