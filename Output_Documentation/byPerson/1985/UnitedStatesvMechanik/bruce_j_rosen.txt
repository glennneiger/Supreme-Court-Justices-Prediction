mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
violation
of
6(d)
that
we
are
presenting
to
the
court
today
clearly
resulted
in
no
demonstrable
prejudice
to
the
petitioners
mechanik
and
lill,
but
was
anything
but
harmless
to
the
integrity
and
independence
of
the
grand
jury
system.
it
is
important
to
evaluate
the
violation
of
6(d)
in
this
context:
one,
in
terms
of
its
purpose;
two,
the
gravity
of
the
violation
and
the
misrepresentation
that
occurred
in
the
district
court
level.
besides
the
obvious
secrecy
motives
behind
federal
rule
6,
there
also
is
to
prevent
undue
influence,
prejudice,
the
potential
to
overwhelm
grand
jurors
by
sheer
numbers
or
the
manner
of
presentation.
it
is
important
to
go
back
in
time
and
re-evaluate
and
scrutinize
what
happened.
august
10th,
1979,
at
the
federal
grand
jury
in
charleston,
west
virginia.
the
government
at
that
time
called
two
witnesses
simultaneously
to
the
stand
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government
asked
each
witness
to
swear,
take
his
oath
simultaneously,
and
they
proceeded
at
that
point
in
time
to
testify
literally
in
tandem,
as
opposed
to
each
giving
a
separate
version
of
the
event.
during
the
course
of
61
pages
of
grand
jury
testimony,
these
two
agents
47
times
used
"we
understood",
"we
believed",
"we
investigated
this
fact".
also
of
some
importance,
at
least
the
district
court
believed
so,
one
was
the
supervisor
of
the
other.
in
addition
to
the
two
witnesses
testifying
simultaneously
before
the
grand
jury,
there
was
not
one,
there
was
not
two,
there
were
three
prosecutors
present
in
the
room,
accounting
for
a
total
number
of
five
government
agents.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
none.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
it
wasn't
through
lack
of
effort
that
they
weren't
in
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i
assume
when
we
compare
it
to
the
normal
practice
of
one
witness
at
a
time,
one
prosecutor,
in
the
event
an
assistant
is
necessary
two
prosecutors.
but
here
we
are
august
10th,
and
we
must
put
it
into
the
context.
within
an
hour
of
five
agents
appearing
in
the
grand
jury
room,
this
grand
jury
returned
this
indictment.
we
are
now
left
to
analyze
whether
there's
a
causal
relationship
between
that
violation
and
the
return
of
the
indictment.
if
there
is
no
relationship,
potentially
we
may
not
be
available
for
any
redress
in
this
court.
in
addition
to
the
two
witnesses
which
at
least
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
been
unable
to
find
another
case
in
recorded
history,
either
of
civil
law,
of
criminal
law,
of
any
other
practice
that
ever
allowed
the
procedure
of
calling
two
witnesses
simultaneously.
the
logic
we
hope
would
appear
obvious,
because
the
logic
is
also
embodied
in
the
concept
of
why
we
sequester
witnesses
at
trial,
to
avoid
this,
to
create
at
least
an
accountability
of
what
a
person
says,
that
later
they
are
accountable.
if
somebody
testifies
we
did
this
or
we
did
that,
how
later
are
they
accountable?
there
is
no
accountability.
but
more
importantly,
in
addition
to
the
two
witnesses
that
testified,
on
numerous
occasions
the
prosecutor,
and
as
evidenced
in
the
joint
appendix,
provided
information
to
that
grand
jury
that
was
part
of
its
considerations
in
an
unsworn,
non-testimonial
fashion.
there
are
numerous
instances
where
the
prosecutor,
in
this
instance
assistant
u.s.
attorney
hoffman,
provided
a
number
of
incidents
as
to
who
was
in
communication
with
the
air
traffic
controller
on
duty
that
night
at
the
kanawha
airport,
the
definition
of
third
party
billings,
how
we
know
that
jim
chadwick
got
a
call
at
his
phone
because
it
was
a
collect
call,
and
explaining
to
the
grand
jury
the
difference
between
collect
calls
and
third
party
billing.
those
facts
become
important
because
this
new
indictment,
this
indictment
that
we
have
labeled
superseding
indictment,
is
almost
a
creature
of
design.
there
appears
not
to
be
a
definition
for
it.
just
30
days
ago
or
60
days
ago,
the
case
before
the
court
of
rojas
contreras,
justice
o'connor
asked
the
government,
in
speedy
trial
considerations,
what
is
this?
what
is
the
superseding
indictment?
to
which
the
government
responded,
a
superseding
indictment
is
something
that
replaces
the
original.
and
apparently
satisfied
with
that,
no
further
inquiry
took
place.
there
is
no
definition.
the
federal
rules
don't
anticipate
it,
so
the
procedure
is
somewhat
cumbersome,
because
it
obscures
an
examination
of
the
prejudice
or
the
potential
error
or
harm
as
a
result
of
what
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
there
was
no
finding
by
the
district
court
level
of
prejudice
on
any
of
the
three
counts
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
correct.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
it's
not
the
existence
of
prejudice;
it's
the
inquiry
of
looking
for
it
that
this
court
throughout
history
in
this
decade
has
abhorred,
a
district
court
going
behind
a
presumptively
valid
indictment,
whether
it
be
for
a
defendant's
benefit,
whether
it
be
for
the
government's
benefit,
going
behind
it
to
examine
or
to
second
guess
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--in
no
way.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
we
would
like
an
untainted
indictment
and
a
trial
on
that
indictment,
yes.
clearly,
to
the
court
it
appeared...
and
again,
we're
at
the
point
of
second
guessing.
it
appeared
at
the
trial
the
real,
almost
stubbornness--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--no.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
make
sure:
one,
the
government,
to
create
a
remedy
for
a
clear
violation.
we
are
here
merely
seeking
a
remedy.
the
concept...
we
are
not
seeking
to
punish
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
it
will
accomplish
allowing
convictions
to
be
obtained
based
on
untainted
indictments,
and
i
think
the
court--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--i
would
have
no
reason
not
to
believe
one
would
reissue.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
no.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
the
standard,
the
very
standard
this
violation
was
judged
in,
was
clearly
inappropriate.
the
defendants,
to
almost
paranoid
degrees,
pretrial
kept
attempting
to
get
grand
jury
material
from
every
ingenious,
litigious
method
available
to
one
with
enough
resources
and
enough
time
to
devise.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
issue...
there
was
a
first
indictment
that
resulted
on
june
14th.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
issue
was
then
raised
requesting
notice,
in
essence
compliance
with
6(d).
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
that
was
raised
within
30
days...
in
the
pretrial
motions
as
they
relate
to
the
first
indictment.
before
the
government
could
respond
as
to
whether
they
complied
with
it
or
whether
even
a
response
was
appropriate,
a
superseding
indictment
issued
on
august
10th.
the
district
court,
upon
motion
of
the
defendants,
then
allowed
an
adoption,
so
that,
as
opposed
to
going
through
the
exercise
in
futility
of
redrafting
an
identical
motion,
it
allowed
an
adoption
of
all
the
pretrial
motions
as
they
were
filed
to
the
first
indictment
to
apply
to
the
second
indictment.
in
fact,
judge--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--then
in
response
to
that,
the
government,
because
under
the
rule
clearly
the
defendant
was
unable
to
show
a
basis
other
than
paranoia
to
believe
that
a
6(d)
violation
occurred,
to
clearly
alleviate
further
inquiries,
the
government
filed
a
response.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
no
unauthorized
people
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
that
resulted
in
this
indictment.
that
response
was
filed
on
august
30th
of
1979.
based
on
the
response,
there
clearly
was
no
basis
for
further
inquiry,
because
the
government
in
apparent
good
faith,
at
least
at
the
time,
was
representing
there
were
no
violations.
let's
continue
on
with
the
main
event,
the
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i
don't
know
if
"satisfied"
is
the
right
word;
not
happy.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
one,
we'd
be
creating
a
legal
fiction.
clearly,
the
defendants
were
tried
on
this
indictment.
the
prosecution
filed
notice
of
intent
to
proceed
on
this
indictment,
not
the
first.
the
jury
was
sworn
as
to
this
indictment,
and
conviction
was
entered
on
this
indictment.
more
importantly,
the
type
of
remedy
that
you
propose
would
have
no
incentive
for
compliance.
if
this
court
determines
that
a
strict
construction
of
6(d)
requires
minimally
one
witness
at
a
time
in
presenting
evidence
to
the
grand
jury,
the
question
is
now
how
do
we
encourage
compliance?
the
government
argues
this
was
a
good
faith
mistake
and
how
can
you
encourage,
as
the
concept
of
leon
would
seem
to
indicate,
how
can
you
encourage
compliance
when
the
mistake,
if
there
was
a
mistake,
was
inadvertent?
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
it
would
appear--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--correct.
but
there
are
values,
whether
it
be
constitutional
values
or
procedural
values,
as
this
court
recognized
in
rose,
where
guilt
is
really
of
a
secondary
concern.
it
is
the
integrity
of
the
entire
system
or
other
possible
motives.
defendants
have
been
propounding,
requesting
access
to
the
grand
jury,
the
right
to
present
exculpatory
evidence,
the
right
not
to
have
illegally
obtained
evidence
presented,
the
right
not
to
have
hearsay
presented,
the
right
not
to
use
perjured
testimony,
the
right
concerning
preindictment
delay.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
all
of
those.
all
of
those--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--no.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
but
clearly--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--correct.
even
the
government
attempts
or
does
in
fact
concede
in
their
brief
that
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
free
from
intimidation,
coercion,
or
improper
procedures
employed
to
gain
the
indictment.
it
appears
frustration
is
obviously
growing
over
defendants'
continued
litigation
over
grand
jury
issues,
as
opposed
to
getting
on
with
the
main
event.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
proposal
suggested
in
terms
of,
there
clearly
was
a
wrong,
what
that
remedy
ought
to
be...
a
number
of
suggestions
have
taken
place
both
in
the
hastings
case
and
the
government
in
their
brief:
contempt
proceedings
against
the
prosecutor.
contempt
wouldn't
apply
to
a
good
faith
violation.
if
in
fact
this
was
inadvertent,
you
can't
encourage
compliance
where
the
violation
was
unintentional.
we
are
not
seeking
to
punish
the
government.
we
are
seeking
to
have
what
i
believe
is
our
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
district
court,
concerning
whether
this
is
that
leon
type
situation
where
because
of
the
blunder
of
the
constable
the
criminal
goes
free,
the
district
court...
and
the
government
in
its
brief
takes
some
liberty
with
the
district
court's
finding.
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
lack
of
bad
faith
in
the
presentation
of
two
witnesses
to
the
grand
jury.
there
appears
in
the
very
well-reasoned
opinion--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
correct,
in
order
to
ensure
compliance.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
correct.
the
encouragement
of
the
reporting
requirement.
the
defendants
in
our
humble
opinion
clearly
asked
for
in
their
pretrial
motion
more
than
they
were
entitled
to.
they
wanted
to
see
grand
jury
minutes,
they
wanted
to
see
instructions.
and
as
this
court
has
clearly
stated,
let's
get
on
with
the
main
event.
the
proposal
that
we're
hoping,
or
the
procedure
that
we
are
hoping
comes
out
as
a
result
of
this
case,
is
no
different
than
a
brady
or
a
gelbhart
situation.
a
defendant
ought
to
be
allowed
to
just
trigger
a
request.
has
the
government
followed
rule
6?
if
the
response
to
that
is
in
the
negative,
it
ends
the
inquiry.
it's
over.
let's
move
on
to
the
trial.
but
if
it's
in
the
affirmative,
the
question
then
becomes...
and
we
must
look
at
this
in
the
pretrial
stage,
because
if
the
indictment
is
defective
it's
jurisdictional.
jurisdiction
creates
the
trial.
the
trial
can't
create
the
jurisdiction.
so
at
that
pretrial
stage...
and
we
must
go
back
in
time
to
fairly
analyze
it
and
not
allow
the
government
to
reap
the
windfall
benefits
of
its
own
misrepresentation
to
the
district
court
in
august,
is
what
should
that
court
have
done
when
confronted
with
a
truthful,
candid
response,
there
was
a
6(d)
violation.
if
in
fact
it
is
this
court's
opinion
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
at
that
point
engage
in
what
took
the
district
court
three
months...
the
matter
was
first
submitted
to
copenhaver
on
may
22nd.
an
opinion,
a
carefully
reasoned
opinion,
finally
was
issued
and
entered
into
the
docket
sheet,
on
august
15th.
it
took
that
judge
three
months
to
comb
the
record
in
a
quasi-result-oriented
approach
to
see,
other
than
this
potentially
diseased--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--clearly
not.
he
was
conducting
the
trial
simultaneously.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
pardon?
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
grand
jury
testimony
was
61
pages.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
61
pages.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
no.
what
the
district
court
judge
did
is
presume
that
this
is
a
tainted
portion
of
the
grand
jury.
he
then
began
to
examine
other
testimony
that
was
coming
out
contemporaneous,
as
3500
disclosures
became
triggered.
and
as
the
government
provided
them
to
the
defense,
put
them
in
the
record,
he
was
then
examining,
using
conduct
occurring
at
the
trial
simultaneously
to
evaluate
whether
this
was
a
harmful,
prejudicial
or
harmless
error.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i'm
not
sure
i
would
use
the
phrase
that
it's
a
windfall
for
us
in
that
my
client--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--to
go
back
through
the
criminal
system
and
stand
trial
again,
whether
that
is
a
benefit
obviously
depends
on
one's
perspective.
and
clearly,
we
would
he
on
much
stronger
footing
if
my
client's
name
were
russell
cooke
or
my
client's
name
were
jim
chadwick.
the
only
testimony
that
required
them
to
stand
trial
and
eventually
resulted
in
an
acquittal...
and
that's
why
those
issues
became
moot...
is
that
tainted,
diseased
testimony.
how
is
the
system
to
prevent
exactly
what
occurred
in
this
case,
maybe
not
to
my
client
in
particular,
based
on
the
analysis--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
they
acquitted.
both
of
the
other
defendants
in
the
first
indictment...
part
of
the
difference
between
the
first
indictment
and
the
second
was
three
defendants
were
added,
one
being
a
fugitive.
the
two
that
were
added,
and
the
court
found
or
implicitly
made
a
finding,
partially
as
a
result
of
this
joint
presentation,
were
chadwick
and
cooke.
both
of
those
cases
resulted
in
acquittals.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
the
tainted
testimony,
as
is
indicated
in
the
exhibit,
provided,
overt
act
hh
in
the
conspiracy
count
provided
the
probable
cause
portion
of
the
indictments
as
they
relate
to
counts
two,
three,
and
four.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i'm
using
the
words
of
the
government
before
the
grand
jury.
the
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
to
support
counts
two,
three,
and
four
were
presented
in
tandem.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
sure,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
but
again,
if
we're
dealing
with
jurisdiction,
assuming
that
i'm
correct
that
a
defective
indictment
is
jurisdictional...
and,
rule
12(b)
seems
to
presume
it's
probably
personal,
because
it's
waivable.
so
if
it's
jurisdiction
you
can't
use...
either
it
existing
or
it
doesn't
exist.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i
understand
there
are
proponents
feeling
targets
ought
to
have
more
rights
before
a
grand
jury.
clearly
that
attitude
has
been
rejected,
whether
he
has
a
right
to
testify
or
a
right
not
to.
he
has
one
right,
and
it
doesn't
seem
terribly,
awfully
difficult
to
comply
with,
the
only
right
he's
got,
that
is
it's
secret
and
one
witness
at
a
time.
and
we're
now
taking
away
that,
one
of
those
cornerstones.
if
we
remove
it
here,
not
only
is
the
government
allowed
to
do
it,
but
in
order
to
notify
a
district
court
of
compliance,
there
is
no
penalty
for
noncompliance.
mr.

throughout
history.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
since
1946,
it
was
codified
within
the
federal
rules
of
procedure.
but
throughout
history,
as
judge
copenhaver...
there
is
no
reported
opinion
other
than
one
instance
in
this
district
in
winter,
which
was
the
basis
of
the
defendant's
request
that
judge
copenhaver
reconsider
his
opinion.
other
than
those
two
cases
they
aren't
reported,
because
they
don't
get
reported
because,
as
the
government
rightfully
states,
the
more
prudent
course,
"proper
and
prudent",
to
use
the
district
court's
findings,
would
be
to
just
dismiss
and
reindict.
using
a
costello
approach
to
the
grand
jury,
it
would
take
an
hour.
i
submit
to
the
court--
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
--whether
it
be
hearsay
or
non-hearsay,
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
i
submit
and
i
hope
that
rule
6
will
remain
intact.
it
is
the
only
rule
protecting
potential
defendants
from
improvident
government
prosecution.
the
inconvenience
of
reindicting
and
reprosecuting
this
case
is
temporary.
to
allow
a
conviction
to
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
what
occurred
on
this
record
is
perpetual.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
rosen
very
briefly,
your
honor.
thank
you.
concerning
the
good
faith
representation,
conspicuously
absent
from
the
record
is
any
determination
by
either
the
district
court
or
the
appellate
court
as
to
whether
the
representation
made
by
the
government
on
august
30th,
1979,
was
good
faith
or
bad
faith.
in
fact,
the
government
concedes
that
they
had
denied
any
irregularity
in
its
oral
argument
to
the
fourth
circuit.
more
importantly,
the
rule
itself,
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
contemplates
exactly
this
remedy
and
contemplates
that
defendants
in
this
position
have
standing
to
raise
this
as
a
remedy.
i
refer
the
court
to
federal
rule
of
procedure
6(e)(3)(c)(ii),
which
states
under
the
disclosure
section:
"when
permitted
by
a
court
at
the
request
of
the
defendant,
upon
a
showing
that
grounds
may
exist
for
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury."
it
contemplates
two
things.
a
defendant
who
has
been
indicted
may
have
standing
to
challenge
that
occurrence.
second
it
contemplates
exactly
the
remedy
we
are
asking
for.
the
question
before
the
court:
is
this
the
situation
that
that
remedy
contemplates?
