mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
the
merits
of
my
argument,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
accusation
that
the
government
made
a
misrepresentation
or
a
lie
to
the
district
court
in
this
case.
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
that
allegation.
the
government
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
understood
rule
6(d)
not
to
be
violated
because
they
read
the
rule
to
mean
where
two
witnesses
could
properly
testify
separately
there
was
no
bar
on
their
joint
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
and
it
made
eminent
good
sense
in
this
case
to
do
so
because
each
of
the
agents
was
in
charge
of
a
different
facet
of
the
investigation,
and
so
the
simultaneous
testimony
allowed
the
grand
jury
to
be
apprised
of
the
events
in
a
chronological,
interrelated
way.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
that
joint
testimony
was
not
presented
in
bad
faith
by
the
government.
now,
the
government
followed
the
same
legal
understanding
of
the
rule
in
its
representation
to
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
unauthorized
person
present.
it
simply
was
not
a
misrepresentation.
it
was
at
best
a
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
rule's
requirements,
a
misunderstanding
that
shouldn't
occur
again
now
that
the
rule
has
been
clarified.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
beyond
that,
let
me
also
say
that
once
the
fact
of
the
joint
testimony
became
known,
chief
judge
knapp,
who
was
then
presiding,
rejected
the
defendants'
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
merits
and
adopted
the
government's
reading
of
the
rule.
so
it
certainly
was
a
reasonable
interpretation,
even
if
it
turned
out
to
be
incorrect.
so
there's
no
basis
whatever
for
the
allegation
that
the
government
engaged
in
misrepresentation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
may
well
have.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
our
position,
it
would
still
be
totally
harmless.
now,
there
could
be
other
remedies
directed
to
the
derelictions
by
the
prosecutor
that
would
be
appropriate
and
warranted
in
such
a
circumstance.
but
it
would
be
harmless--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--is
this
before
trial,
justice
stevens,
or
after
the
trial?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
in
our
view,
as
we
argue
at
length
in
our
brief,
this
kind
of
a
technical
defect
in
a
grand
jury
is
not
a
basis
for
dismissing
an
indictment,
even
before
trial.
what
the
district
court
should
do
then,
either
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
more
likely
afterward,
is
deal
with
the
bad
faith
action
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
it
may
be
that
there's
nothing
that
the
district
court
could
do
in
that
circumstance
or,
depending
on
the
particulars,
there
may
be
a
variety
of
prospective
remedies,
such
as
the
certification
requirement
that
the
district
court
devised
in
this
case,
that
would
help
to
ensure
prospective
compliance
with
the
rule
in
the
future.
perhaps
just
bringing
this
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
attorneys--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
probably
correct,
although
it's
possible
that
that
would
have
made
him
more
sensitive
to
the
nature
of
the
rule
than
he
was
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
there
be
a
remedy
for
every
good
faith
violation.
the
question
is
whether
the
system--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
you
don't
have
to
have
it,
and
we
think
it
is
quite
a
technical
rule
in
the
end.
but
the
rule
is
designed
to
ensure
that
the
system
works
in
a
particular
way.
the
drafters
of
the
rule
thought
it
was
better
only
to
have
one
witness
in
the
grand
jury
at
a
time,
and
presumably
prosecutors
in
almost
every
case,
in
virtually
every
case,
will
comply
with
that
and
the
system
will
work
as
the
drafters
intended.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
assume,
even
apart
from
coercive
remedy,
that
prosecutors
will
routinely
violate
or
ignore
the
requirements
of
the
rule.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
my
point
is
that
you
don't
need
anything
to
deter
them.
the
prosecutors
certainly
generally
act
in
good
faith.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
prosecutors
go
around
deliberately
violating
the
rule.
but
there
are
remedies,
even
if
some
coercive
remedies
are
thought
to
be
necessary,
that
will
ensure
compliance,
that
will
deter
or
prevent
violations
from
occurring,
such
things
as
contempt
for
willful
violations
of
the
rule,
disciplinary
sanctions,
public
censure.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
we
take
the
position
that
even
before
trial
the
defendant
can't
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
can
move,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
the
judge
ruled
on
it,
twice.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
are
a
number
of
ways,
apart
from
defense
motions
to
dismiss,
in
which
a
defendant
can
find
out.
and
this
case
well
illustrates
the
point.
the
rule
6(d)
violation
here
was
uncovered
not
through
the
defendant's
boilerplate
motion
to
dismiss,
but
rather
through
the
prosecutor's
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
under
the
jencks
act.
so
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
here
was
really
beside
the
point.
the
defendant
was
simply
a
free
rider
and
is
now
seeking
to
get
the
benefits
of
a
violation
that
was
detected
through
independent
means.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
our
position
would
probably
be
the
same,
and
in
that
circumstance
it
may
be
enough
for
the
error
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney,
so
that
through
an
educational
program
or
otherwise
the
error
wouldn't
recur
in
the
future.
there's
no
basis--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
there
may
be
some
situations
that
are
so
extreme,
that
also
happen
to
violate
rule
6(d),
that
it
is
conceivable
that
the
court
might
find
them
sufficient
notwithstanding
the
petit
jury's
conviction.
we
would
think
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
that
there
aren't
any
such
violations.
but
as
rose
against
mitchell
makes
clear--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
all
that
that
did
was
violate
rule
6(d),
we
don't
think
that
would
be
enough.
now,
if
it
turned
the
grand
jury
into
a
mob
scene
rather
than
a
judicial
proceeding,
that
wight
be
a
different
question,
although
even
there
we
would
submit
that
there
would
be
no
basis
for
reversing
an
otherwise
untainted
petit
jury
conviction.
now,
all
of
these
issues
which
we've
touched
on
briefly
can
be
traced
back
to
this
court's
decision
essentially
in
costello
versus
united
states.
in
costello
this
court
held
that
an
indictment
is
valid
and
it
is
enough
to
call
for
the
trial
of
the
accused
on
the
charges
if
the
indictment
is
facially
sufficient
and
returned
by
a
legally
constituted
and
unbiased
grand
jury.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
rule
6(d)
violation
did
not
impair
either
the
authority
or
the
impartiality
of
the
grand
jury,
nor
do
the
defendants
contest
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
on
its
face.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
costello
controls
here
and
requires
that
the
defendants'
convictions
be
affirmed.
the
costello
rule
reflects
the
limited
role
played
by
the
grand
jury
in
the
federal
criminal
justice
system
and
the
substantial
systemic
costs
that
would
be
imposed
for
little,
if
any,
benefit
if
the
grand
jury's
charging
process
could
be
challenged
by
defendants.
the
grand
jury
is
only
a
preliminary
step
in
the
criminal
process.
at
issue
before
the
grand
jury
is
not
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
only
the
question
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
go
forward
for
trial.
the
grand
jury
is
designed
to
be
a
relatively
informal
and
unstructured
screen
for
weeding
out
insubstantial
cases,
and
it
does
not
incorporate
the
rigorous
procedures
applicable
at
a
criminal
trial.
for
example,
the
grand
jury
process
is
ex
parte
and
non-adversarial,
hearsay
evidence
as
well
as
illegally
obtained
evidence
can
be
used.
the
standard
for
an
indictment
is
probable
cause,
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unlike
the
requirement
of
unanimity
for
the
petit
jury,
an
jurisdiction
can
be
based
on
a
vote
of
as
few
as
12
out
of
23
grand
jurors.
and
if
the
first
grand
jury
does
not
return
an
indictment,
the
case
can
be
represented
to
a
subsequent
grand
jury
and
an
indictment
obtained.
the
grand
jury
thus
provides
a
rough
justice
screen
to
give
some
assurance
that
there
is
a
basis
for
the
charges
brought
against
the
defendant.
the
grand
jury
process
necessarily
recognizes,
however,
that
mistakes
will
be
made
and
errors
will
occur
in
the
screening
mechanism,
and
that
some
innocent
defendants
will
be
put
to
trial.
the
entire
grand
jury
system
rests
on
the
premise
that
it
is
the
trial
and
not
the
grand
jury
itself
that
affords
the
essential
safeguards
for
the
innocent.
it
does
not
denigrate
the
screening
function
of
the
grand
jury
to
conclude,
as
the
court
understood
in
costello,
that
the
grand
jury
was
simply
intended
to
establish
a
reasonable
means
for
initiating
a
prosecution,
thereby
setting
in
train
the
rest
of
the
criminal
process,
in
which
substantial
protections
would
be
provided
the
accused.
now,
in
light
of
the
nature
and
role
of
the
grand
jury,
it
would
impose
significant
and
unjustified
costs
on
the
criminal
justice
system
to
allow
indictments
to
be
challenged
and
dismissed
for
a
procedural
irregularity
in
a
grand
jury.
it
would
put
undue
emphasis
on
the
initial
charging
process
and
be
a
misallocation
of
finite
resources
for
the
system
to
scrutinize
the
workings
of
the
grand
jury
and
permit
the
operation
of
that
body
to
be
tried
before
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence
can
be
determined.
this
we
take
to
be
the
central
meaning
of
costello.
it
is
all
too
easy
for
a
defendant
to
allege,
as
the
defendants
did
in
this
case,
that
it
is
possible
that
some
sort
of
an
error
might
have
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
just
as
there
is
no
perfect
trial,
there
is
no
perfect
grand
jury
proceeding
either.
procedural
challenges
to
grand
juries
are
routinely
raised
in
virtually
every
contested
federal
criminal
case,
and
especially
those
cases
in
which
the
grand
jury
investigation
was
at
all
lengthy
or
complex.
now,
although
experience
indicates
that
very
few
of
these
procedural
challenges
to
the
grand
jury
are
meritorious,
litigation
over
them
takes
substantial
judicial
and
prosecutorial
resources,
resources
that
could
be
better
utilized
in
other
parts
of
the
criminal
process.
litigating
these
challenges
can
also
substantially
delay
the
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits,
where
the
central
issue
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence
will
be
resolved.
in
raising
these
challenges,
we
give
defendants
various
collateral
benefits
to
which
they
are
not
otherwise
entitled,
including
discovery
of
secret
grand
jury
materials,
an
additional
bargaining
chip
in
plea
negotiation,
and
a
delay
in
the
ultimate
day
of
reckoning
at
trial.
in
fact,
as
discussed
in
defense
trial
practice
manuals,
challenges
to
the
grand
jury
procedure
are
often
filed
precisely
in
order
to
obtain
these
kinds
of
unjustified
advantages.
and
even
if
a
challenge
to
a
grand
jury
procedure
is
successful,
the
overwhelmingly
likely
consequence,
as
the
defendants
here
concede,
is
that
the
case
will
be
represented
to
a
grand
jury
and
a
procedurally
regular
indictment
returned.
such
a
duplicative
process
further
taxes
prosecutors,
witnesses,
and
grand
jurors,
and
in
fact
can
be
quite
burdensome,
especially
in
cases
involving
lengthy
investigations.
and
even
in
simpler
cases,
quite
a
burden
can
be
imposed
on
the
system,
as
this
case
illustrates.
in
this
case,
there
were
some
30
witnesses
before
the
initial
grand
jury
and
an
additional
ten
new
witnesses
before
the
superseding
grand
jury
as
well
as
the
recall
of
some
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
the
first
time.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
this
court
or
in
the
lower
courts?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
an
everyday
occurrence
in
the
lower
courts
that
defendants
raise
these
issues
as
a
way
of--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--there
are
all
kinds
of
issues.
one
that
is
commonly
in
vogue
among
the
defense
bar
is,
where
government
investigators
are
sworn
as
the
agent
of
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
obtain
documents
or
take
custody
of
documents
subpoenaed
in
a
grand
jury,
defendants
seek
to
dismiss
the
indictment
even
after
conviction
on
the
ground
that
there's
no
authority
for
designating
a
government
official
as
the
agent
of
the
grand
jury.
challenges
are
raised
to
some--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
we
have
two
cases
in
the
tenth
circuit
now.
in
the
kilpatrick
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
somewhere
on
the
order
of
20
months,
it
was
thrown
out
before
trial
on
several
grounds,
principally
on
the
ground
of
this
agency
issue.
it
is
not
often
that
these
are
successful.
they
sometimes...
although
even
there
they
do
not
frequently
prevail
in
the
district
court,
they
very
seldom
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
why
we
find
ourselves
in
this
court
so
infrequently
on
this
issue.
but
that's
exactly
the
point.
there
is
very
little,
if
any,
merit
to
the
vast
majority
of
these
challenges,
and
yet
they
come
up
in
virtually
every
federal
criminal
case
and
take
a
great
deal
of
time
and
resources.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
essence
that's
correct.
now,
we
have
put
to
one
side
the
question
of
constitutional
defects
in
the
grand
jury
because
this
case
doesn't
present
any
such
issues.
certainly
where
you're
dealing
with
the
kinds
of
procedural
irregularities
that
this
case
typifies,
we
think
there's
no
basis
whatever
and
very
substantial
grounds
for
precluding,
dismissal
of
the
indictment
either
before
trial
or
after
trial.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
once
the
petit
jury
has
convicted
at
trial
and
found
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
assuming
that
the
grand
jury
would
not
have
indicted
him.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
once
we
have
the
fact
of
the
conviction,
we
know
that
there
is
probable
cause
and
that
the
charges
against
the
defendant
are
not
unfounded,
which
are
the
purposes
of
the
screening
function
of
the
grand
jury,
there's
no
point.
it
would
be
quite
pointless
to
go
back
at
that
stage
and
revisit
the
grand
jury
and
speculate
about
the
effect
that
a
procedural
irregularity
might
have
had
on
the
charging
decision.
in
effect,
those
kinds
of
questions
about
the
institution
of
the
charges
merge
into
the
conviction.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
that
would
not
be
a
reason.
i
thought
justice
o'connor
was
asking
a
different
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
there
are
several
things
wrong
with
it.
first,
the
chances
in
fact
that
any
of
these
kinds
of
procedural
irregularities
would
undermine
the
existence
of
probable
cause
is
exceedingly
remote.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
think
the
court
can
look
at
the
kinds
of
errors
that
have
been
litigated
in
court
of
appeals
and
the
results
of
those
cases
and
come
to
that
assessment.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
and
this
case
does
not
involve
the
substance--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--no.
and
in
most
cases--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--justice
stevens
was
asking
about
the
whole
range
of
cases
involving
alleged
irregularities.
mr.
mark
i.

defendants
frequently--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--no,
i
don't
believe
any
effort
has
been
made.
but
the
problem
here
is
not
the
substance
of
the
rule.
in
most
cases
prosecutors
will
comply
with
the
requirements
of
rule
6.
the
issue
here
is
the
remedy
for
those
rare
cases
in
which
there
is
a
violation.
now,
just
because
defendants
allege
it
and
litigate
it
routinely
doesn't
mean
that
there's
any
merit,
there's
any
substance
to
the
allegation.
quite
the
contrary,
the
reported
decisions
indicate
that
very
few
challenges
are
meritorious,
and
yet
the
system
has
to
litigate
each
one
of
these
challenges,
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
the
sound
and
efficient
operation
of
the
process.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
have
no
comments
about
them
specifically.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
court
in
rose
against
mitchell
did
not
find
that
the
racial
discrimination
there
had
resulted
in
any
injury
to
the
defendant's
personal
rights
that
warranted
reversal
of
the
conviction.
rather,
rose
rested
on
the
proposition
that
such
discrimination
violated
fundamental
societal
values
of
equality
and
implicated
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
itself.
the
court
also
noted
that
racial
discrimination
was
the
core
concern
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
when
practiced
in
the
selection
of
grand
jurors
infringed
the
rights
of
third
parties,
those
citizens
who
were
wrongly
excluded
from
participating
in
the
criminal
justice
process.
and
finally,
the
court
gave
great
weight
to
the
fact
that
its
own
precedents
had
for
more
than
a
century
recognized
the
availability
of
post-trial
relief
for
racial
discrimination.
none
of
those
things--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
is
an
exception
to
our
argument.
we
have
doubts
about
whether
it
is
a
correct
exception,
as
we
indicated
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief
here.
but
even
if
the
court
in
vasquez
against
hillery
adheres
to
the
rose
decision,
that
would
not
control
this
case,
because
none
of
the
special
factors
unique
to
the
racial
discrimination
context
that
the
court
relied
on
in
rose
are
present
here.
there
are
no
fundamental
constitutional
values
at
stake,
no
rights
of
third
parties
are
jeopardized,
no
question
of
judicial
integrity
is
presented,
and
no
issue
comes
up
whether
the
court
should
adhere
to
its
own
prior
precedents.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
if
the
court
were
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
exactly
right
justice
powell.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
it
hasn't,
and
i'm
sorry
if
my
answer
was
confusing.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
my
point
only
though
was,
justice
powell,
that
if
the
court
overturns
the
rule
of
rose
against
mitchell
in
vasquez
against
hillery,
then
our
case
is
considerably
easier.
on
the
other
hand,
even
if
the
court
adheres
to
rose,
our
case
is
much
different
and
is
not
controlled
by
the
decision
there.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
the
first
question.
i
think
the
second
question
presented
is
a
sufficient
ground
for
resolving
this
case,
although
the
first
question
likewise
is
sufficient
by
itself.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
and
that
would
be
the
reason
why
the
court
might
decide
to
resolve
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
arguments
that
the
defendant
has
made.
but
the
court
should
also
be
aware,
as
the
substance
of
our
arguments
indicates,
that
this
is
quite
a
serious
problem
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
courts,
and
we
think
that
it
is
an
issue
that
is
properly
presented
in
this
case
in
our
first
question
presented.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
this
issue
does
frequently
arise
in
the
middle
of
trials,
not
invariably.
sometimes
it
comes
up
before
trials,
for
example
if
the
government
makes
an
early
jencks
act
disclosure,
and
sometimes
in
fact
it
doesn't
come
up
until
after
trial.
but
here
and
not
infrequently,
it
does
come
up
in
the
middle
of
trial.
but
the
point
really
is
not
the
time
at
which
it
is
raised.
the
consideration
is
the
time
at
which
it
is
resolved.
once
the
petit
jury
has
returned
a
unanimous
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
if
the
rule
6(d)
violation
would
be
a
ground
for
dismissal
prior
to
trial,
but
not
after
a
conviction,
i
think
the
district
court
might
have
some
obligation
to
take
a
look
at
the
issue
before
the
jury
returned.
but
our
position,
our
submission
here,
is
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
ground
either
before
trial
or
after
trial,
and
that
whatever
the
reason
that
the
district
court
does
not
pass
on
the
issue
before
trial,
even
if
it
would
be
sufficient
at
that
time,
the
fact
of
the
petit
jury's
unanimous
verdict
of
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
necessarily
establishes
the
existence
of
probable
cause
and
demonstrates
that
the
charges
were
not
unfounded.
and
at
that
point--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
that
it
did.
there
was
a
redacted
indictment
that
was
drafted
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case.
then
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
further
parts
of
the
indictment,
and
specifically
the
telephone
counts
and
overt
acts,
were
stricken
from
the
indictment.
those
telephone
counts
had
been
the
basis
of
agent
rinehart's
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
those
were
stricken
before
the
case
even
went
to
a
jury,
and
i
think
from
those
trial
rulings
i
infer
that
the
indictment
went
to
the
jury,
but
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
of
that.
now
let
me
turn
specifically
to
the
policies
of
rule
6(d)
and
show
that
they
do
not
call
for
any
different
analysis
than
the
costello
rule
provides
for.
rule
6(d)
does
not
expressly
provide
the
remedy
of
dismissal
for
a
breach
of
the
rule.
so
the
question
of
formulating
a
judicially
created
remedy
should
be
governed
by
the
analytical
principles
generally
applicable
in
the
grand
jury
area.
under
those
principles,
as
i
discussed
with
justice
stevens
a
moment
ago,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
generally
held
that
an
indictment
is
not
to
be
dismissed,
even
before
trial,
or
a
conviction
reversed
because
of
a
procedural
irregularities
in
the
grand
jury.
and
in
fact,
some
of
the
kinds
of
defects
that
the
courts
have
found
insufficient
to
warrant
relief
had
a
greater
potential
for
affecting
the
grand
jury
process
than
the
rule
6(d)
violation
here.
it
would
be
highly
incongruous
to
carve
out
a
special
and
more
stringent
remedy
for
violations
of
rule
6(d),
which
in
actuality
are
quite
unlikely
to
affect
the
grand
jury
in
its
determination
of
probable
cause.
now,
although
the
rule
and
its
advisory
committee
notes
are
silent
on
the
purposes
of
rule
6(d),
three
possible
purposes
have
been
suggested.
first,
the
rule
helps
to
preserve
grand
jury
secrecy,
since
a
joint
witness
or
other
unauthorized
person
is
not
normally
under
an
obligation
to
maintain
the
secrecy
of
testimony
given
while
he
is
in
the
grand
jury
room.
in
our
view,
this
is
the
most
sensible
explanation
for
the
rule
itself.
however,
grand
jury
secrecy
serves
two
important
interests.
it
promotes
the
societal
interest
in
effective
grand
jury
investigations,
and
it
safeguards
the
anonymity
of
those
people
who
are
investigated
but
not
charged
by
the
grand
jury.
an
indicted
defendant
has
no
stake
or
no
standing
to
assert
either
of
these
interests,
and
they
provide
no
basis
for
affording
relief
to
him,
if
the
rule
is
violated.
in
addition,
because
the
two
dea
agents
in
this
case
had
access
to
all
the
grand
jury
materials
and
were
under
a
secrecy
restriction,
there
was,
as
the
district
court
found,
no
realistic
threat
to
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
here.
now,
the
second
possible
purpose
for
the
one-witness
rule
is
to
help
to
prevent
a
witness'
testimony
from
being
influenced
by
his
knowledge
of
the
testimony
of
other
witnesses
or
by
the
presence
of
other
witnesses
in
the
grand
jury
room.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
witness
sequestration
rule.
but
any
such
concern
about
the
trustworthiness
of
the
witness'
testimony
goes
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
which
under
costello
the
defendant
cannot
be
heard
to
contest.
the
same
point
also
answers
the
concern
expressed
by
the
district
court
that
the
grand
jury
might
be
hampered
in
assessing
the
personal
knowledge
or
credibility
of
jointly
testifying
witnesses.
indeed,
since
the
government
can
use
hearsay
evidence,
which
precludes
any
assessment
of
the
knowledge
or
credibility
of
the
absence
declarant,
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
the
joint
appearance
of
two
witnesses
can
impair
the
grand
jury
process
or
justify
dismissal.
and
in
this
case,
furthermore,
the
two
agents
in
charge
of
the
entire
dea
investigation
had
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials,
including
the
testimony
of
each
other,
and
therefore
it
is
inconceivable
that
their
joint
appearance
could
have
affected
their
testimony
to
the
grand
jury.
thirdly,
the
one
witness
rule
may
be
a
prophylactic
measure
to
ensure
that
the
grand
jurors
are
not
intimidated
by
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
prosecution
witnesses
in
the
grand
jury
room.
but
certainly
not
every
violation
of
the
rule
threatens
this
underlying
policy
or
justifies
the
kind
of
relief
that
might
be
appropriate
if
the
policy
were
in
fact
infringed.
because
the
risk
of
essentially
mob
rule
is
far
removed
from
any
violation
that
can
realistically
be
imagined,
a
one-witness
error
is
not,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
substantial
aggravating
factors,
a
basis
for
dismissing
the
indictment.
moreover,
in
this
case,
where
both
witnesses
were
already
known
to
the
grand
jury
and
in
fact
could
properly
have
testified
separately,
the
presence
of
the
one
extra
witness
by
virtue
of
the
joint
appearance
could
not
possibly
have
intimidated
the
grand
jurors.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
insofar
as
it
affirmed
the
defendants'
convictions
and
reversed
insofar
as
it
reversed
their
convictions.
