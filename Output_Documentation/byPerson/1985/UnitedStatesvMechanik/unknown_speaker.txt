unknown
speaker
you
emphasize
the
numbers.
how
many
defense
people
in
there?
none.
unknown
speaker
so
how
are
numbers
important?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
are
numbers
important
if
you
don't
have
any?
what
are
you
going
to
compare
the
numbers
to?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
finding
of
prejudice
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
no
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
do
you
challenge
the
fairness
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
your
client
had
a
fair
trial
and
was
convicted,
and
there's
no
showing
of
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
and
he
should
be
turned
loose?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
want?
you
want
a
retrial
or
a
fresh
indictment?
reindictment.
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
a
new
indictment
will
not
be
issued?
do
you
suggest
that
the
indictment
won't
issue?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what's
this
exercise
all
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
will
it
accomplish
except
giving
your
client
another
bite
at
the
apple?
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
that
a
new
indictment
will
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
just
an
advisory
opinion
you're
asking
us
for?
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
issue
first
raised?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
when
was
that
raised?
unknown
speaker
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
and
said?
unknown
speaker
it
turns
out
there
was,
though.
there
was
a
violation.
argument
proposed
by
the
government,
temporarily
adopted
by
the
district
court
and
forever
abandoned,
this
concept
of
a
joint
witness.
and
the
joint
witness
they
proposed
to
the
first
district
court...
and
there
were
two
district
courts.
one
was
ill.
nothing
inappropriate
with
the
rule
to
allow
witnesses
to
testify
in
tandem.
upon
renewing
the
motion,
and
there
was
the
transfer
to
the
second
district
judge,
copenhaver,
the
defendants,
upon
another
decision
in
the
same
district
for
the
same
type
of
violation,
filed
a
petition
on
may
22nd,
1980,
with
the
second
trial
judge
asking
him
to
reconsider
in
light
of
this
other--
in
response
to
that
and
the
efforts
of
the
defendant
be
prejudiced
by
allowing
the
case
to
proceed
analyze
whether
or
not
a
dismissal
should
have
occurred?
there
clearly
was
prejudice
to
the
defendant
by
delaying
consideration.
as
the
government
argues
or
proposes
in
their
brief
in
this
case,
they
are
attempting
to
hold
us
to
a
post-conviction
harmless
error
standard,
when
the
defendants
raised
the
issue
pretrial
and
but
for
the
government's
at
best
misrepresentation
and
at
worst
lie,
the
issue
would
have
been
resolved
at
the
pretrial
stage.
as
the
government
even
concedes
in
its
petition
or
brief
in
support
of
their
petition
to
the
fourth
circuit,
it
says
that
at
a
pretrial
stage
really
what
you're
confronted
with
is
"the
temporary
inconvenience
of
resubmitting
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury
as
opposed
to
potential
prejudice."
the
stakes
of
the
analysis
significantly
change
at
a
post-conviction
or
mid-trial
stage.
the
district
court
found
the
multitude
of--
--well,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
the
new
grand
jury
was
allowed
and
then
the
grand
jury
returned
the
indictment,
but
you
stood
on
the
conviction
that's
new
extant?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
have
accomplished
this
prophylactic
objective
that
you
referred
to.
unknown
speaker
but
is
this
not
somewhat
like
the
harmless
error
situation
that
courts
are
confronted
with
frequently?
conceding
that
an
error,
even
of
constitutional
proportions,
has
occurred,
we
often
say
it
had
no
impact
on
the
ultimate
results
and
therefore
ignore
it.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
essentially
what
chapman
and
california
decided
many
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
right
not
to
be
arrested
without
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
you
arrest
a
person
without
probable
cause
and
then
you
convict
him,
you
don't
use
any
fruits
of
the
arrest,
you
convict
him,
and
everybody
agrees
that
there's
plenty
of
evidence
to
convict,
it
isn't
going
to
do
you
much
good
in
that
situation
to
say
we
need
a
remedy
for
the
arrest
without
probable
cause.
you're
certainly
not
going
to
set
aside
the
conviction,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
followed
by
a
perfectly
fair
trial.
you
don't
set
aside
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
if
we
just
ruled
for
the
government
in
this
case
that
would
enable
everybody
to
get
on
with
the
main
event
and
left
it
to
the
district
judge
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
federal
rule
that
you
say
was
violated.
certainly
setting
aside
convictions
isn't
the
only
way
to
enforce
a
rule
dealing
with
the
proper
attendance
before
a
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
how
would
a
reversal
enforce
the
rule
if
the
breach
were
inadvertent
any
more
than
contempt
would?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
there
would
be,
some
judge
or
some
procedure
might
unload
a
little
bit
on
the
prosecutor
for
making
that
kind
of
a
representation.
but
i
take
it
that
if
judge...
what's
his
name,
copenhaver...
judge
copenhaver
had
been
sitting
on
this
case
originally,
he
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
he
thought
there
was
a
violation,
but
he
just
thought
the
proceedings
were
too
far
along.
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
certainly
is
a
pretrial
opportunity
to
have
all...
to
make
sure
that
the
grand
jury
rules
are
enforced.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
reason
there
probably
if
wasn't
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
fact
is
true
that
there
was
a
gross
misrepresentation.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
he
didn't
have
anything
else
to
do?
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
the
record?
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
this
grand
jury
record
that
took
three
months?
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
it?
unknown
speaker
huh?
unknown
speaker
it
takes
three
months
to
act
on
61
pages?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
suggested,
counsel,
that
the
government
might
get
a
windfall
as
a
result
of
its
own
mistake.
but
isn't
this
a
contest
of
whether
you
get
a
windfall,
your
client
gets
a
windfall,
or
the
government
gets
one?
you
have
conceded
that
a
new
grand
jury
will
issue
the
same
indictment,
that
nothing
is
going
to
change
because
the
trial
was
perfectly
fair.
so
isn't
that
what
it
comes
to,
a
windfall
for
you
or
a
windfall
for
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
used
it.
i
was
taking
your
language.
unknown
speaker
put
that
testimony
must
have
been
repeated
before
the
petit
jury,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
petit
jury
had
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
it,
i
presume,
in
finding
the
defendant
guilt
or
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
was
none
of
the
tainted
testimony
directed
towards
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
the
probable
cause
portion
of
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
testimony
of
these
two
witnesses
whom
you
say
couldn't
properly
both
be
before
the
grand
jury,
did
it
implicate...
did
their
testimony
to
the
petit
jury
implicate
your
clients
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
that
extent
the
petit
jury
evaluated
it
and
found
your
clients
guilty,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
it
wasn't
just
the
grand
jury
processing
that
testimony.
the
petit
jury
vindicated
what
the
grand
jury
found.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
every
procedural
violation
of
the
rules
amounts
to
a
deprivation
of
jurisdiction.
we've
long
passed
that
day.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
long
has
he
had
this
right
of
one
witness
at
a
time
which
you
say
is
a
cornerstone?
unknown
speaker
6(d)
is
that
old?
unknown
speaker
well,
using
a
costello
approach
to
the
grand
jury
would
take
about
two
minutes,
i
would
think,
because
costello
says
it
just
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
happens,
what
kind
of
testimony
is
presented
to
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
language
in
costello
that
goes
a
good
deal
further
than
just
hearsay
or
non-hearsay.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
levy,
is
it
not
true,
though,
that
that
colloquy
would
have
induced
the
defendant
not
to
inquire
further
on
this
point?
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
be
different
if...
supposing
what
he
says
is
true.
supposing
that
it
was
a
deliberate
misrepresentation,
would
it
make
any
difference?
it
would
still
be
totally
harmless,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
remedy
be?
say
that
eventually
the
district
judge
came
out
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
said
he
thought
this
was
a
violation
of
the
rule.
what
should
the
district
judge
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
each
stage.
as
soon
as
he
finds
out,
what
should
he
do?
say
it's
before
trial.
unknown
speaker
let's
say
the
prosecutor
says,
oh,
i
just
didn't
read
the
rule,
i'm
sorry;
i'm
new
and
they
didn't
teach
me
this
in
law
school,
and
rule
6(d)
isn't
all
that
clear,
although
it's
been
construed
a
number
of
times;
i
goofed.
what
does
the
district
judge
do?
unknown
speaker
the
certification
requirement
wouldn't
have
helped
here
because
the
prosecutor
thought
he
was
doing
the
proper
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
we
don't
need
the
rule,
either.
we
don't
have
to
have
this
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
prevail
in
the
case...
and
i
understand
your
position.
if
you
prevail
in
the
case,
will
the
rule
be
followed
in
the
future?
why
would
a
prosecutor
have
any
motive
to
follow
the
rule
in
the
future?
why
wouldn't
he
say,
i
think
i
can
get
my
case
in
a
lot
faster
by
getting
all
four
witnesses
in
at
once.
unknown
speaker
but
why
not?
what
would
deter
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
defendant
finds
it
out
he
can
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
can't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
take
the
position,
but
he
can
move.
unknown
speaker
he
did
in
this
case,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
ruled
on
it.
unknown
speaker
would
that
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
be
appealable?
unknown
speaker
how
could
a
defendant
find
out
before
trial
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
or
not,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
an
inexperienced
prosecutor
who
somehow
hadn't
bothered
to
read
rule
6(d)
and
remained
in
the
grand
jury
room
during
their
deliberations?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
violation
of
rule
6(d)
that
in
your
view
would
be
grounds
for
setting
aside
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
for
instance,
if
all
the
witnesses
for
a
particular
offense
were
brought
in
at
the
same
time
and
were
present
throughout
all
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
question
as
a
point
of
information.
i
know
we've
had
litigation
involving
whether
there's
racial
discrimination
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
form
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
are
there
a
large
number
of
these
issues
litigated
other
than
this
6(d)?
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
lower
courts,
yes,
as
challenges
to
indictments
based
on
irregularities
in
the
grand
jury.
what
are
the
particular
issues
you
get?
unknown
speaker
well,
give
me
an
example
of
a
couple
of
issues.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
successful,
i
take
it,
very
often?
unknown
speaker
basically,
you're
asking
us
for
a
holding
that
no
matter
what
happens
before
a
grand
jury,
don't
dismiss
the
indictment.
that's
what
you're
asking?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
levy,
what
if
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
the
error
the
charging
decision
might
have
been
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
can
be
established
that
the
violation
was
such
that
the
district
court
judge
is
persuaded
that
but
for
this
error
the
grand
jury
might
not
have
issued
the
indictment
against
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
because
the
evidence
submitted
at
trial
may
have
been
different
or
more
substantial
than
at
the
grand
jury
level.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
a
reason...
that's
not
a
reason
to
disallow
challenges
pretrial,
just
because
you
can
say,
well,
we're
going
to
convict
him
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
what
her
question
was.
but
you're
making
the...
your
argument
is
much
broader
than
that.
you
say
there
shouldn't
be
any
challenge
allowed
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--pretrial.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
he
alleges.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
if
he
says,
look,
i
never
would
have
been
indicted
if
this
irregularity
wouldn't
have
happened.
and
judge,
it
is
pretrial.
let's
make
them
get
a
new
indictment.
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
we
just
take
your
word
for
that?
unknown
speaker
has
any
movement
been
made
to
get
rule
6
off
the
books?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
it
was
something
horrible.
unknown
speaker
because
you
had
how
many
cases
you
said
you
had
in
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
you
had
a
whole
range
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
any
effort
been
made
to
get
rid
of
that
by
changing
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
do
you
have
any
comments
about
the
race
cases,
rose
against
mitchell
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
them?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
an
exception
to
your
argument
today.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you,
but
the
question
put
to
you
by
my
brother
justice
blackmun
and
you
response
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
constitutional
question,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
make
that
clear
on
the
record.
that
issue
hasn't
been
argued
to
us
today.
unknown
speaker
right.
well,
i
would
now
like
to
come
back
to
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
levy,
the
first
question
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
concerns
a
pretrial
action
on
an
indictment
that
is
alleged
to
be
improper.
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question?
the
second
question
concerns
whether
or
not,
after
there
has
been
a
valid
trial,
an
irregularity
in
the
indictment
under
rule
6(d)
requires
the
setting
aside
of
that
trial.
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
only
the
second
question
is
here
or
whether
we
must
decide
both
your
first
question
and
your
second
question.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
decided,
arguably.
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
much
broader
decision
than
the
second
question.
of
course,
it's
rather
difficult
to
say
to
the
defendants
in
this
case,
although
you
made
your
motion
before
trial,
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
passed
upon
until
after
trial,
wasn't
finally
decided
by
the
district
court
until
after
trial,
means
that
you're
in
the
same
boat
as
someone
who
first
made
the
motion
after
trial.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
correct,
mr.
levy,
that
typically
the
issue
we
have
in
this
case
would
arise
during
the
trial,
rather
than
before
or
after,
because
normally
the
defendant
won't
get
to
see
the
grand
jury
minutes
until
you
make
your
jencks
act
disclosure,
and
that's
going
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
isn't
it?
so
isn't
it
typically
an
issue
that
would
arise
during
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
be
a
proper
disposition
for
the
trial
judge,
if
it
comes
up
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
to
say,
well,
let
me
wait
and
see
if
he
gets
convicted,
and
if
he
gets
convicted
then
he'd
say,
well,
obviously
there
was
probable
cause,
so
i'll
deny
the
motion.
if
he
gets
acquitted,
he'd
say,
well,
i
don't
have
to
pass
on
the
motion;
okay,
that's
the
end
of
it.
would
that
be
correct
judicial
behavior,
do
you
think,
for
the
district
judge
when
it
arises
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
to
say,
i'll
defer
a
ruling
until
the
end
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
last
question.
i'm
sorry.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
indictment
went
to
the
jury
in
this
case?
