mr.
gill
deford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
correct
one
statement
that
my
opponent
made.
there
is
no
double
dipping
at
issue
in
this
case.
no
individual
with
a
surviving
divorced
spouse
or
a
surviving
spouse
who
is
not
divorced
will
receive
any
extra
benefits
as
a
result
of
this
case.
mr.
gill
deford
if
the
rule
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
were
otherwise?
mr.
gill
deford
as
far
as
i
know,
there'
no
way
that
a
social
security
recipient
could
receive
more
than
he
or
she
is
entitled
to
under
the
most
liberal
possible
benefit
scheme
that
he
or
she
is
entitled
to.
if
she
is
entitled
to
more
than
one
benefit,
she
will
receive
only
the
highest
of
those
two
benefits,
not
a
combination
of
the
two
benefits.
mr.
gill
deford
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
thought
there
might
be
some
confusion
in
the
court
about
that
because
of
the
use
of
the
word,
"double
dipping".
the
constitutional
issue
of
this
case
is
the
validity
of
the
social
security
act
scheme
which
treats
two
classifications
of
survivor
beneficiaries
differently
for
a
reason
unrelated
to
the
overall
purposes
of
the
scheme.
in
so
doing,
the
discrimination
contradicts
two
crucial
ingredients
on
which
congress
has
premised
its
distribution
of
survivors'
benefits.
those
two
factors,
dependency
on
the
deceased
wage
earner
and
the
encouragement
of
survivors
to
remarry,
are
applicable
in
all
relevant
respects
to
all
widowed
spouses,
both
non-divorced
and
divorced.
the
challenged
legislation,
however,
treats
them
differently
upon
remarriage,
despite
the
fact
that
both
classifications
of
widows,
again
non-divorced
and
divorced,
are
entitled
to
survivors'
benefits
in
the
absence
of
a
remarriage.
it
is
appellees'
contention
that
congress's
disfavored
treatment
of
divorced
widows
at
remarriage
was
not
the
product
of
reasoned
legislative
analysis
but
was
instead
an
unthinking
and
stereotyped
response
spawned
by
the
urge
to
reach
a
compromise.
now,
there
are
two--
mr.
gill
deford
--that
may
be
an
overstatement
on
my
part,
a
generalization,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
true
that
this
instance
more
than
most
indicates
that
congress
wanted
to
make
a
deal
quickly
and
was
looking
for
some
way
to
make
that
deal,
and
rather
than
carefully
investigate
who
the
various
classifications
were
and
what
the
reason,
what
the
rationale
for
that
deal
was,
simply
selected
a
political
group
that
was
handy,
a
discrete
group
that
was
handy,
to
cut
the
deal.
i
think
that
was
clearer
in
this
instance
than
in
most
other
social
security
act
situations
we
have
where
one
classification
is
disfavored
as
opposed
to
another.
mr.
gill
deford
i
would
think
that
would
probably
be
irrational
because--
mr.
gill
deford
--irrational,
because
of
the
amount
of
money
at
stake.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
more
that
congress
indicates,
the
senate
or
the
house
or
both,
that
it's
planning
ahead,
this
one
step
at
a
time
analysis,
and
planning
to
take
care
of
everything
when
it
can,
the
more
clearly
that
is
set
out
and
the
more
bases
it
gives
for
doing
that,
the
more
likely
the
scheme
is
to
be
rational.
but
in
the
situation
you
describe
where
all
the
senate
is
doing
is
simply
saying,
there's
a
few
dollars
more
to
be
spent
here
and
we
don't
want
to
spend
it
at
this
time,
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
gill
deford
--obviously,
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
draw
that
line,
but
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
the
amount
of
money
at
stake
here
at
the
absolute
most
was
less
than
one
one-hundredth
of
a
percent
of
the
annual
outlay
of
the
social
security
system.
mr.
gill
deford
it
was
less
than
$17
million
a
year.
we
do
not
know
the
exact
figure.
mr.
gill
deford
it's
unclear
from
the
legislative
history
how
much
less
than
$17
million,
but
that's
the
maximum
that
it
could
have--
mr.
gill
deford
--no,
not
that
that
amount
alone
makes
it
irrational,
but
in
the
context
of
what
happened
between
the
house
and
senate
in
this
situation,
i
do
not
think
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
fiscal
concerns
motivated
congress
in
this
case.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
you
hypothesize
that
the
senate
set
that
out
in
its
legislative
history,
which
of
course
is
not
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
gill
deford
i
would
say
that
even
if
the
senate
had
said
that,
without
anything
else
to
explain
why
it
selected
this
particular
discrete
classification
of
divorced
surviving
spouses,
that
it's
inappropriate
for
the
legislature
simply
to
say,
they're
not
going
to
get
the
benefits
but
people
in
a
virtually
identical
situation
are.
there
has
to
be
a
rationale
that's
either
set
out
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
can
reasonably
infer
to
have
motivated
congress
to
have
selected
that
particular
classification.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
just
fiscal
concerns
alone
cannot
provide
the
basis
for
discriminating
against
a
particular
classification.
this
court
in
the
fritz
decision,
in
u.s.
railroad
retirement
board
v.
fritz,
rested
in
large
part
on
the
fact
that
congress
was
seeking
to
protect
the
railroad
retirement
fund,
but
it
still
carefully
determined
what
the
rational
basis
was
for
selecting
the
particular
group
of
railroaders
whose
benefits
would
be
cut.
mr.
gill
deford
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
i'm
aware
of,
in
this
court's
decision,
that
that
distinction
should
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
the
importance
of
fiscal
concerns.
fiscal
concerns
are,
of
course,
always
relevant
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
basis
to
draw
the
line,
some
rational
basis
other
than
fiscal
concerns,
to
draw
the
line
between
various
classifications.
as
i
said,
there
are
two
consistent
themes
in
the
development
of
the
social
security
survivors'
programs,
and
both
of
those
are
raised
in
this
case.
one
of
those
themes
is
congress's
recognition
repeatedly
over
the
years
of
various
classifications
whose
dependency
on
a
deceased
wage
earner
renders
them
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
survivors'
program.
and
the
other
theme
which
runs
parallel
to
that
is
congress's
persistent
desire
to
eliminate
the
remarriage
penalty.
the
remarriage
penalty,
of
course,
operates
so
that
if
a
survivor
beneficiary
remarries
someone
else,
the
general
rule
was,
that
person
would
lose
her
social
security
benefits.
but
congress
has
gradually
eliminated
the
remarriage
penalty
in
various
circumstances,
and
it
is
indicated
that
the
general
remarriage
rule,
the
remarriage
penalty,
should
essentially
be
eliminated
altogether.
so,
those
two
themes,
i
think
are
crucial
in
understanding
appellees'
contention
in
this
case.
by
1965
congress
had
recognized
that
divorced
surviving
spouses'
dependency
on
the
deceased
wage
earner
was
sufficient
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
survivors'
benefits.
this
rendered
them
effectively
the
same
in
all
relevant
respects
as
non-divorced
surviving
spouses.
the
remarriage
penalty,
however,
was
still
in
effect
and
congress
recognized
that
it
created
a
serious
dilemma
for
many
widows.
in
1977,
therefore,
congress
set
out
to
remove
the
remarriage
barrier,
but
as
we
have
noted,
removed
it
only
for
one
classification
of
surviving
spouses,
those
who
were
not
divorced,
what
we
normally
call
widows
and
widowers.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
understand
what
happened
in
1977.
the
house
voted
to
remove
the
remarriage
penalty
for
both
surviving
divorced
spouses
and
for
surviving
spouses
who
were
not
divorced.
the
senate
said
nothing
about
this
issue
and
indicated
it
had
no
intention
of
removing
the
remarriage
barrier
for
either
classification.
the
issue
then
went
to
conference
committee,
and
that
conference
committee
as
we
have
noted,
essentially
split
the
difference
and
decided
to--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
believe
the
house
version
would
have
removed
the
remarriage
penalty
for
virtually
every
classification,
including
the
ones
you've
mentioned,
and
that's
why
the
$1.3
billion
figure
which
has
been
mentioned
is
higher
than
we're
talking
about
because
it
includes
other
classifications
as
well.
now,
when
the
conference
committee
decided
to
split
the
difference,
as
i've
called
it,
and
remove
the
remarriage
penalty
only
for
widows,
not
for
divorced
surviving
spouses,
it
provided
absolutely
no
explanation
for
this
decision.
it
was
clear
at
that
time
that
congress
as
a
general
rule
did
want
to
eliminate
the
remarriage
penalty,
but
no
explanation
was
provided
as
to
why
that
penalty
should
continue
for
one
group
of
surviving
spouses
and
not
for
the
other
group
of
surviving
spouses.
the
irony
is
that
far
from
providing
a
reason
to
treat
these
two
classifications
differently,
remarriage
if
anything
should
have
provided
an
incentive,
as
the
district
court
observed,
to
treat
them
the
same.
congress
had
therefore
by
1977
carefully
reasoned
one
two
crucial
factors.
one,
why
survivors'
benefits
should
be
available
to
surviving
divorced
women,
namely,
their
dependency
on
the
deceased
wage
earner
and
secondly,
why
the
remarriage
penalty
should
be
eliminated
as
a
general
rule.
congress
provided
by
that
time
no
reasoning
whatsoever
about
why
the
remarriage
penalty
should
continue
for
this
one
discrete
classification
of
surviving
spouses.
congress
based
its
reasoning,
to
the
extent
there
was
any
reasoning
at
all,
solely
on
divorce
but
it
did
not
explain
why
divorce
in
that
context
was
a
relevant
characteristic
to
discriminate
between
two
classifications.
consequently
the
government
throughout
this
case
in
the
district
court
and
the
briefs
for
this
court,
today
in
oral
argument,
has
been
forced
to
offer
a
series
of
after
the
fact
rationales
in
an
effort
to
explain
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
when
it
treated
these
two
classifications
differently.
mr.
gill
deford
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
clear
that...
to
this
court's
rulings,
that
if
the
lowest
standard
of
review,
the
rational
basis
test
is
used,
that
the
actual
reasons
do
not
have
to
be
set
out
in
the
legislative
history.
it's
also
clear,
however,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
various
opinions,
that
it
certainly
would
prefer
if
the
reasons
were
set
out,
and
that
if
the
reasons
are
not
set
out,
the
court
should
at
least
attempt
to
determine
if
the
reasons
advanced
by
the
government
could
reasonably
be
presumed
to
have
been
the
reasons
which
motivated
congress.
the
discrimination
in
this
case,
we
submit,
simply
does
not
serve
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act,
especially
as
explained
by
the
survivors'
program
and
by
the
treatment
of
the
remarriage
penalty.
last
term
this
court
in
another
equal
protection
case,
williams
v.
vermont,
observed
that
the
distinction
between
the
classifications
bears
no
relation
to
the
statutory
purpose,
and
i
think
the
same
thing
holds
true
here.
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
survivors'
program
has
been
to
recognize
dependency
on
the
deceased
wage
earner
and
to
encourage
a
survivor
to
remarry.
these
factors
are
not
carried
out
by
the
discrimination.
mr.
gill
deford
justice
o'connor,
i
think
we're
talking
here
about
a
portion
of
the
social
security
program,
the
survivors'
program,
and
the
two
factors
that
i
have
set
out,
the
question
of
dependency
and
the
remarriage
penalty--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
think
that's
true,
as
a
general
rule.
mr.
gill
deford
this
is
a
part,
and
a
very
small
part,
of
the
overall
scheme,
but
i
think
it's
also
true
that
when
congress
selects
one
classification
to
receive
benefits
and
another
classification
to
be
disfavored
and
not
to
receive
benefits,
there
has
to
be
some
discernible
distinction
between
those
classifications
which
explains
congress's
actions.
mr.
gill
deford
in
the
past,
congress
definitely
made
some
decisions
based
on
divorce
status.
but
in
this
case,
by
1965
congress
had
already
determined
that
divorced
surviving
spouses
were
also
entitled
to
survivors'
benefits,
essentially
equivalent
to
those
received
by
non-divorced
surviving
spouses.
and,
i
think
that
determination
by
congress
indicated
essentially
an
equivalence
in
dependency
and
therefore--
mr.
gill
deford
--no,
but
i
think
it
indicated
that
congress
saw
so
few
distinctions
between
the
two
classifications
that
if
it
were
to
distinguish
between
them
at
a
later
point,
it
had
to
provide,
or
we
had
to
be
able
to
discern
the
valid
reason
for
that
distinction.
and
it's
particularly
ironic
here
that
the
remarriage,
the
instance
of
remarriage,
is
a
basis
on
which
congress
uses
to
distinguish
between
them
when
prior
to
remarriage
it
does
not
distinguish
between
them.
both
sets
of
spouses,
divorced
and
non-divorced,
are
entitled
to
survivors'
benefits.
it
seems
logical
as
the
district
court
concluded,
that
if
congress
were
going
to
distinguish
between
the
two
classifications
it
would
have
done
so
at
the
death
of
the
wage
earner,
not
somewhere
down
the
line
when
remarriage
takes
place.
just
to
conclude
on
this
point,
we
think
in
this
instance
congress
was
not
discriminating
between
the
classifications
in
order
to
further
a
particular
goal.
it
was
discriminating
because
it
needed
some
group
to
single
out
in
order
to
forge
a
compromise,
and
it
selected
the
divorced
because
they
were
a
group
which
were
handy,
and
the
amount
of
money
at
stake
was
relatively
small,
and
a
compromise
could
be
made.
we
submit
that
in
light
of
the
overall
goal
of
encouraging
survivors
to
remarry,
it
was
totally
irrational
for
congress
to
make
remarriage
the
basis
on
which
to
discriminate
between
these
two
classifications.
the
other--
mr.
gill
deford
--justice
stevens,
i
have
to
confess
i
haven't
given
that
any
thought.
i
believe
in
1983
the
remarriage
penalty
was
eliminated
for
parents
and
children
as
well.
mr.
gill
deford
certainly
there's
an
incentive,
but
the
reason
we
brought
the
case
and
briefed
the
case
as
it
is,
is
because
of
the
similarity
between
the
two
groups
of
spouses,
and
i'm
certain
many
distinctions
could
be
drawn
between
parents
and
children
as
opposed
to
spouses,
which
might
make
it
rational
to
distinguish
between
those
classifications.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
in
1977...
i
think
all
that
happened
in
1977
was
that
congress
decided
to
eliminate
the
remarriage
penalty
for
widows
alone,
widows
and
widowers,
but
not
for
divorced
surviving
spouses,
parents
and
children.
mr.
gill
deford
that's
correct,
but
as
i
indicated,
i
think
the
distinctions
between
children
and
parents
are
such
that
it's
not
logical
to
compare
those
classifications.
the
other
issue
in
the
case,
of
course,
is
the
district
court's
class
certification,
but
i
think
the
real
issue
and
the
overriding
question
involving
that
is
whether
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
can
restrict
the
size
of
classes
and
therefore
as
a
practical
matter
the
number
of
those
who
can
receive
relief
through
the
use
of
strict,
literal
and
essentially
impractical
interpretations
of
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
which
were
designed
for
entirely
different
purposes.
in
light
of
the
remedial
goals
of
the
social
security
act,
and
especially
the
nature
of
this
claim,
constitutional
claim,
the
court
should
not
permit
the
secretary
to
deflect
legitimate
constitutional
contentions
through
this
mechanism.
now,
the
first
issue
of
course
is
what
is
known
under
the
rubric
of
exhaustion,
whether
an
individual
claimant
has
to
go
entirely
through
the
administrative
process
before
he
or
she
can
move
into
district
court
and
make
the
contention
there.
in
this
case
the
secretary
formally
and
in
writing
waived
full
exhaustion
for
the
named
plaintiffs.
the
secretary
determined
that
there
was
a
final
decision
on
their
claim
in
the
administrative
process.
the
secretary
determined
that
there
were
no
factual
issues
in
dispute,
and
the
secretary
determined
that
there
was
no
statutory
interpretation
in
dispute.
the
only
claim
raised
is
the
one
the
secretary
was
not
competent
to
resolve,
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
challenged
scheme.
this
court
in
prior
cases
has
recognized
waivers
by
the
secretary
of
full
exhaustion
in
other
constitutional
cases.
in
califano
v.
goldfarb,
in
matthews
v.
diaz,
weinberger
v.
southey,
the
court
has
recognized
the
secretary
can
waive
full
exhaustion.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
the
crucial
issue
is
whether
or
not
they're
dissimilar,
the
term
you
use.
mr.
gill
deford
the
secretary
has
formally
waived
for
one
group.
the
question
is
whether
a
district
court
can
infer
from
that
waiver,
and
from
the
nature
of
the
case,
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
secretary
has
also
made
a
final
decision
for
the
other
members
of
the
class
who
are,
a
defined
by
the
class--
mr.
gill
deford
--the
court
is
not
ignoring
those,
nor
is
the
court
overruling
the
secretary.
the
district
court
in
this
case...
and
our
argument
is
that
a
district
court,
as
this
court
has
done
in
other
instances,
can
infer
that
a
final
decision
has
been
entered
by
the
secretary.
in
the
diaz
case
the
secretary
herself
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
exhaust.
the
district
court
and
then
this
court
held
that
despite
that,
as
a
practical
matter
the
secretary
had
to
determine
that
there
was
a
final
decision
and
that
no
further
exhaustion
was
required.
so,
what
we
are
talking
here
for
the
most
part
is
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
the
secretary
but
for
the
court
to
analyze
as
a
practical
matter
what
the
secretary
has
done
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
final
decision
has
been
entered
in
the
administrative
process.
we
think
it's
logical
for
a
district
court,
based
on
the
determination
that
named
plaintiffs
have
no
factual
disputes.
it's
logical
for
a
district
court
to
infer
that
final
decisions
for
the
class
members
are
also
appropriate.
for
the
class
members
as
well
as
for
the
named
plaintiffs
there
are
no
factual
or
legal
disputes
with
the
secretary,
nor
is
there
any
ability
of
the
secretary
to
take
any
action
with
respect
to
the
claim
at
issue
which
is
a
constitutional
claim.
we
think
it
is
very
important
also
to
recognize
what
justice
stevens
was
hinting
at
in
his
questions
to
my
opponent,
that
there
is
no
practical
purpose
served
by
forcing
the
class
members
to
go
to
exhaustion
when
the
named
plaintiffs
have
already
received
a
final
decision
from
the
secretary.
the
effect
of
forcing
exhaustion
in
that
context
is
not
only
wasteful
but
it's
counterproductive.
if
the
secretary
is
ultimately
successful
at
whatever
level,
district,
court
of
appeals
or
supreme
court,
then
all
the
factual
exhaustion
which
has
taken
place
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
will
have
been
totally
wasted
because
the
class
members
for
the
most
part
are
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
benefits
anyhow,
as
the
court
has
held
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
so,
not
only
is
a
waste
of
administrative
resources,
but
it's
actually
counterproductive
to
the
entire
system.
we
think
also
that
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
the
practical
reason
why
the
secretary
is
pressing
exhaustion
in
this
context,
and
we
think
he's
doing
it
because
it's
a
shield
to
protect
him
from
significant
relief
when
plaintiffs
are
successful
in
district
court.
there
is
absolutely
no
practical
reason
to
require
exhaustion
for
named
plaintiffs.
once
they
receive
an
initial
decision
saying
they
are
ineligible
for
benefits
because
their
facts
are
such
that
they
are
not
eligible
under
the
statute,
no
purpose
is
then
served
by
requiring
them
to
go
through
an
administrative
process.
once
the
secretary
determines
that
a
constitutional
claim
exists,
which
the
secretary
himself
has
no
competence
to
resolve,
the
only
logical
conclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
a
final
decision
has
been
reached,
so
that
no
further
exhaustion
is
required.
now,
the
other
component
of
the
class
action
issue
is
what
is
known
as
the
60-day
rule
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
class
members
moved
untimely
through
the
administrative
process
and
in
the
district
court.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
notice
filed
by
the
named
plaintiff,
mrs.
owens,
in
october
1982
asking
for
reconsideration
of
her
initial
decision
was
a
notice
to
the
secretary
that
a
constitutional
claim
was
being
raised
and
that
it
therefore
told
the
administrative
and
judicial
process,
this
is
a
conventional
principle,
it's
been
used
in
many
other
contexts.
when
notice
is
given,
the
time
is
told.
it
is
commonly
used
in
class
actions
as
a
way
of
protecting
the
rights
of
class
members.
it's
regularly
used
in
title
7
cases.
mr.
gill
deford
i
believe
the
honda
case,
honda
v.
clark.
mr.
gill
deford
that
was
a
supreme
court
decision,
yes,
your
honor.
the
honda
v.
clark
holding
was
used
to
protect
the
right
of
the
class
members.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
this
court
of
course
has
never
dealt
with
this
express
issue
under
the
social
security
statute.
i
would
point
out
also
that
the
briefs
of
the
parties
are
somewhat
misleading
on
one
crucial
point,
and
that
is
that
for
99
percent
of
the
class
members
the
totalling
at
issue
here
is
not
what
we
might
call
judicial
totalling,
it's
administrative
totalling.
by
filing
a
notice
with
the
secretary,
by
putting
the
secretary
on
notice,
what
ms.
owens
did
was
to
stop
the
running
of
the
time
for
individuals
to
move
through
the
administrative
process.
she
was
not...
there
might
have
been
some
individuals
who
already
received
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
although
i'm
doubtful
of
that
fact.
it
also
would
have
told
the
time
for
them
to
proceed
to
district
court.
but
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
recognize,
for
most
of
the
class
members,
what
was
told
was
the
administrative
process,
until
such
time
as
mrs.
owens
had
herself
received
a
final
decision
through
the
secretary's
ruling
on
the
reconsideration
request.
now,
there
are
excellent
reasons,
we
think,
to
apply
this
general
totalling
principle
in
this
context.
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
are
one,
and
the
nature
of
the
issue
of
course
is
another
crucial
component.
this
is
a
constitutional
challenge
and
it
is
imperative,
as
this
court
has
indicated
on
many
occasions
including
the
sanders
case,
the
social
security
recipients
have
an
opportunity
to
bring
constitutional
challenges
before
this
court.
as
a
practical
matter
if
totalling
is
not
permitted,
99
percent
or
90
percent
of
most
class
actions
will
be
prohibited
from
raising
a
constitutional
challenge.
they
will
never
seriously
have
an
opportunity
to
bring
their
case
to
court.
the
court,
this
court
has
construed
other
aspects
of
the
statute
which
allows
individuals
to
go
to
district
court
in
a
flexible
way
under
the
venue
provision,
the
exhaustion
provision,
the
question
of
injunctive
relief,
the
question
of
class
action
in
general.
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
literal
terms
of
42
u.s.c.
section
405-g
do
not
necessarily
control.
there
has
to
be
a
practical
way
of
guaranteeing
that
classes
can
be
certified
and
the
individuals
can
bring
their
cases
in
a
realistic
way.
the
class
members
in
this
case
are
not
trying
to
avoid
compliance
with
the
50-a
rule.
they
are
simply
recognizing
that
as
a
normal
principle,
when
the
secretary
is
put
on
notice,
the
period
for
proceeding
through
the
administrative
process
is
told.
no
purpose,
no
practical
purpose
is
served
here
by
a
literal
application
of
the
50-day
rule.
the
only
purposes
served
is
that
of
the
secretary
which
artificially
prevents
some
claimants
from
obtaining
relief.
thank
you.
