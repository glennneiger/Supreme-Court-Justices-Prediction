how
did
the
bill
which
passed
the
senate
differ
from
the
bill
which
passed
the
house?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the
senate
consider
it
after
the
house?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
certainly
say
that
about
a
lot
of
legislation,
can't
you,
that
was
spawned
by
the
urge
to
reach
a
compromise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
were
perhaps
clearer
than
it
is,
so
that
it
was
apparent
that
the
senate's
balking
at
the
inclusion
of
the
divorced
and
remarried...
was
purely
financial,
that
their
view
was
that
it's
going
to
cost
us
more
money
than
we
have
now,
we
may
be
ready
to
do
it
next
year
but
we
can't
do
it
this
year,
we
just
don't
have
the
money
now,
so
we'll
not
give
benefits
to
as
many
people
as
the
house
wanted
to,
in
your
view
is
that
irrational?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
irrational.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
would
have
to
be
involved
for
the
senate's
action
to
be
rational?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
it,
$17
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
$15
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
argument
is,
anyway,
that
that
small
an
amount,
as
you
put
it,
makes
it
irrational?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
with
that
small
an
amount,
it
is
irrational
to
think
that
the
senate
would
be
motivated
by
concern
for
saving
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i'm
hypothesizing,
that
the
senate
said,
we
are
concerned
about
this
$17
million?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
other
than
a
desire
not
to
spend
as
much
money
as
the
proponents
wanted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there,
there
were
people
being
cut.
here
it's
a
question
of
people
getting
an
additional
benefit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
is
challenging
the
standing
of
the
people
with
whom
the
secretary...
with
respect
to
whom
the
secretary
has
waived,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
question
of
whether
dissimilar
people
can
be
included
in
the
class
with
respect
to
whom
the
secretary
hasn't
waived?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
they're
dissimilar
to
the
extent
that
in
one
group
the
secretary
has
waived
and
in
the
other
they
haven't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
ever
been
applied
against
the
government
in
any
case
that
you
know
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
the
rule
that
several
cases
in
this
court
laid
out
was
that
when
you
deal
with
the
government,
you
turn
square
corners,
and
that
lots
of
rules
that
apply
to
a
private
defendant
don't
apply
to
the
government.
