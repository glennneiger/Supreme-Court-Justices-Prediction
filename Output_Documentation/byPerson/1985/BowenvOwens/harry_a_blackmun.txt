ms.
kuhl,
you
say
they
have
always
treated
them
differently.
is
that
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
prior
to
1977?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
a
test
of
genuineness
rather
than
dependency,
as
justice
stevens
points
out?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
so
that
there
wasn't
a
marriage
just
before
death
in
order
to
qualify?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
can
you
say
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
between
the
divorced
spouse
who
satisfied
the
ten-year
period,
and
the
widow,
no
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
interested
in
your
saying
it
was,
and
then
changing
to
the
possible
"could
have
been".
what
in
the
legislative
history
supports
your
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
you're
saying,
although
you
are
hesitant
to
express
it,
that
there
is
nothing
in
so
many
words
in
the
legislative
history.
you
have
to
speculate
on
the
fiscal
considerations
and
what
congress
might
have
done.
the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse.
