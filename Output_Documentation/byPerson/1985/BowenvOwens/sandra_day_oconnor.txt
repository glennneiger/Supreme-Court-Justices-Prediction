i'm
not
sure
that's
quite
sufficient
to
describe
it.
hasn't
congress's
obligation
in
social
security
been
to
distribute
a
finite
amount
of
money
among
beneficiaries
that
congress
determines
should
receive
that
finite
amount?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
overall,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
congress
just
has
not
had
unlimited
funds
in
the
social
security
fund
to
distribute,
and
it's
had
to
make
some
very
hard
choices,
how
to
distribute
those,
and
what
people
should
receive
as
benefits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
just
a
part
of
the
overall
scheme?
justice
sandra

historically,
congress
has
made
some
differences
applicable
or
attributable
to
divorce
status.
maybe
it's
moving
away
from
that
today,
but
i'm
sure
that
you
have
to
concede
that
over
a
period
of
time
congress
has
opted
to
make
some
decisions
turn
on
divorce
status.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
just
tied
congress's
hands
forevermore
and
that
was
the
end
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
secretaries
issue
regulations
that
define
when
the
secretary
is
to
be
deemed
to
have
waived.
why
should
a
court
be
permitted
to
ignore
those
administrative
regulations?
