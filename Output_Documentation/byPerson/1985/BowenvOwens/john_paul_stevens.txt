justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
a
little?
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
you
were
sort
of
interrupted.
what
was
your
first
reason
again,
that
they
were
always--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--our
relevant
period
is
after
1977?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
during
the
period
after
1977,
and
confining
our
attention
to
survivors
when
the
wage
earner...
after
the
wage
earner's
death--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--congress
then
didn't
treat
them
differently
except
for
the
one
thing
that's
in
issue
here,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
had
to
have
been
married
for
ten
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
was
that...
that's
why
there
are
two
different
classes.
one
is
a
divorce
and
the
other
is...
the
wife
had
to
be
married
also.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
a
dependency
test...
if
the
divorced
wife
was
a
millionaire,
wouldn't
she
still
get
the...
had
been
married
for
ten
years,
would
she
not
be
eligible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
possible
in
the
other
situation
where
the
widow's
benefit...
could
the
deceased
wage
earner
owe
a
divorced...
maybe
was
married
ten
or
15
years
and
divorced
and
then
had
a
second
wife,
could
he
have
double
obligation?
i
mean,
could
the
account
have
that
double--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
either
the
widow
or
the
divorced
wife
survivor
could
be
a
double
dipper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
got
to
be
at
least
one
divorce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
categories?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
your
first
point
about
the
fact
finding
issue.
is
it
not
correct
that
if
you
prevail
on
the
merits
you'd
never
have
to
engage
in
all
that
fact
finding,
whereas
under
your
view
you'd
have
to
do
it
regardless
of
who
wins?
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
they
can't
have
one
decision
binding
on
everyone,
you've
got
to
go
through
all
this
extra
fact
finding
regardless
of
what
the
general
ruling
would
be
on
the
basic
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
win,
everybody
in
the
class
loses,
and
if
you
have
all
these
hearings
you'll
find
out
if
there
a
another
reason
why
they
might--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
collateral
estoppel.
they
just
lose
on
the
merits,
if
you're
right
on
the
basic--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
her
point
was
that
any
beneficiary
might
receive
double
benefits.
rather,
a
given
wage
earner's
account
might
have
to
pay
two
different
people
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
your
opponent
makes
the
point
that
the
remarriage
rule
applies
not
just
to
the
spouses
but
also
surviving
parents
and
children,
i
guess.
in
the
house
version
would
they
have
removed
it
entirely,
or
just
in
the
spousal
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
to
your
class
action,
would
you
agree
it
was
rational
for
them
to
apply
the
remarriage
rule
to
the
parents
and
the
children,
not
to
the
widows?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
one
could
argue
that
there
also
should
be
an
incentive
in
those
groups,
not
to
discourage--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
may
have
it
wrong,
but
as
i
understand
it
in
'77
they
decided
to
put
the
divorced
survivors
either
with
the
non-divorced
survivors,
widows,
in
other
words,
or
with
the
children
and
their
parents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
see,
the
effect
of
that
was
to
treat
the
divorced
people
in
the
same
way
they
treated
the
children
and
parents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
connection
with
both
that
point
and
the
totalling
point,
the
government
disagrees
with
the
date
that
they
picked
for
the
60-day
rule,
the
date
that
the
named
plaintiff
received
notice.
do
you
agree,
though,
that
if
the
date
had
been
advanced
to
the
date
of
filing
suit,
that
there
would
be
totalling
for
all
the
class,
and
you
redefined
the
class
with
reference
to
that
date,
the
totalling
would
be
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
can
be
properly
included
within
the
class
even
though
they
don't
file
individual
actions?
