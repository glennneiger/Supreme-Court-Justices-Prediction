ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
issues
for
decision,
first,
the
constitutionality
of
certain
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
in
effect
between
1977
and
1983.
the
provisions
at
issue
permit
payment
of
survivors'
benefits
to
widows
and
widowers
to
continue
even
after
they
remarry
after
age
60,
but
payment
of
survivors'
benefits
to
surviving
divorced
spouses
ceases
upon
their
marriage
even
if
that
event
occurs
after
age
60.
this
differing
treatment
of
widowed
spouses
and
divorced
spouses
is
challenged
under
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
second
issue
in
the
case
concerns
the
propriety
of
the
classification
entered
by
the
district
court,
and
this
issue
requires
the
court
to
consider
yet
again
the
requirements
of
section
405-g
of
title
42,
jurisdictional
provision
for
review
of
social
security
benefit
claims.
before
getting
into
the
merits
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
clarify
just
how
the
provisions
in
question
work,
because
the
terminology
used
is
not
always
as
illuminating
as
it
could
be.
a
wage
earner
is
entitled--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--thank
you,
justice
white.
i
thought
that
was
almost
the
hardest
part
of
this
case.
a
wage
earner
is
entitled
to
have
his
or
her
family
receive
certain
types
of
benefits
based
on
the
wage
earner's
earnings
attempt.
the
type
of
benefits
involved
here
are
called
survivors
benefits,
and
that
means
that
they
are
benefits
paid
to
certain
members
of
the
wage
earner's
family
because
the
wage
earner
has
died.
now,
the
wage
earner's
widow
or
the
wage
earner's
widower
receives
benefits
after
the
wage
earner's
death,
and
they...
these
benefits
are
called
surviving
widowed
spouse
benefits,
and
they
come
rather
automatically.
that
is,
the
spouse
is
presumed
to
be
dependent
for
purposes
of
the
act.
if
the
wage
earner,
however,
was
divorced
before
he
or
she
dies,
the
wage
earner's
former
spouse
receives
benefits
after
the
wage
earner's
death
if
the
marriage
between
the
wage
earner
and
the
former
spouse
lasted
at
least
ten
years,
and
these
types
of
benefits
are
called
surviving
divorced
spouse
benefits.
although
the
rule
used
to
be
that
survivors'
benefits
terminated
upon
remarriage
of
the
spouse,
and
this
was
called
the
remarriage
rule,
in
1977
congress
eliminated
this
remarriage
rule
for
widowed
spouses
over
the
age
of
60,
but
all
other
survivors'
benefits
still
continued
to
terminate
on
remarriage,
and
this
was
true
not
only
for
divorced
spouses'
benefits
but
also
for
benefits
to
dependent
parents
of
the
wage
earner
and
dependent
children
of
the
wage
earner.
so,
in
1977
congress
made
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
widows
and
widowers
but
it
still
kept
in
another
category
not
only
the
divorced
spouses
but
also
the
dependent
children
and
dependent
parents.
there
are
three
basic
reasons
why
the
step
congress
took
in
1977
has
a
rational
basis.
first,
congress
has
always
treated
married
spouses
different
from
divorced
spouses,
both
because
the
entire
structure
of
the
act
is
based
on
the
family
unit,
and
because
congress
has
assumed
that
divorced
spouses
depend
less
on
each
other
for
economic
support
than
do
couples
who
stay
married.
it
was
rational
for
congress
to
recognize
these
differences
between
married
and
divorced
spouses
on
the
event
of
remarriage
because--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--i
believe
it
is,
justice
blackmun,
until
1983
when...
which
is
after
the--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--prior
to
1977,
yes,
they
were
treated
differently
because
initially,
of
course,
widows
and
widowers...
well,
widows
at
least
were
getting
benefits
and
divorced
spouses
were
not
getting
benefits
at
all,
and
then
congress
permitted
divorced
spouses
to
get
benefits,
but
that
divorced
spouses
had
to
be
married
for
20
years
and
to
meet
certain
criteria
of
dependency
before
they
could
get
benefits.
so,
in
other
words
they
were
treated
differently
because
congress
had
a
dependency
test
all
along
with
regard
to
divorced
spouses
but
it
did
not
have
a
dependency
test
with
regard
to
widows
and
widowers.
to
briefly,
then,
state
the
second
reason
why...
the
second
rational
basis
for
congress's
action
here,
when
congress
permitted
some
divorced
spouses
to
receive
benefits,
congress
created
a
situation
where
there
was
a
potential
for
two
spouses
to
be
receiving...
one,
a
current
spouse
and
one
a
former
spouse,
to
be
receiving
benefits
at
the
same
time
based
on
the
one
wage
earner's
account,
and
it
was--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--they
had
always
been
treated
differently,
both
because
there
were
different
assumptions
about
dependency
of
divorced
spouses,
and
because
there
was
a...
the
whole
system
is
based
on
the
family
unit.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that's
right.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
yes.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
they
still
treated
them
differently
because
there
still
was
this
ten
year
dependency
test,
if
you
will.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
for
ten
years.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
she
had
to
be
married,
but
didn't
have
to
be
married
for
ten
years.
the
ten
year
test
is
really
a
dependency
test
and
it's
similar
to
dependency
tests
that
congress
uses
for
dependent
parents.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
yes,
but
the
fact
that
congress
may
have
been
over-inclusive...
i
mean,
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
earlier
cases
that
in
a
social
security
system
congress
is
forced
to
deal
with
sort
of
broad,
generalized
criteria.
it
can't
have
individualized
tests.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i'm
not
certain
i
understand
the
question.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
no,
it
wasn't,
because
of
the--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
first
of
all,
this
court
has,
i
believe
in
califano
versus
jobst,
there's
sort
of
a
chronology
that
the
court
follows
through
in
its
opinion,
but
the
way
this
ten-year
test
evolved,
the
way
it
evolved
was,
as
i
mentioned
previously,
there
were
no
benefits
for
surviving...
for
divorced
spouses,
and
then
congress
had
a
two-pronged
test
of
dependency.
the
reason
was
because
they
were
concerned
about
women
in
particular
who
had
been
married
to
a
wage
earner
for
a
long
period
of
time
with
perhaps
having
no
job
themselves
and
then
were
divorced,
so
the
criteria
that
congress
set
up
were,
number
one,
marriage
for
20
years
and
number
two,
some...
a
more
specific
dependency
test
that
had
to
do
with
whether
the
divorced
spouse
was
receiving
alimony
while
the
wage
earner
was
still
alive.
then,
i
believe
in
1972,
and
again
this
is
recounted
in
the
jobst
opinion,
congress
became
a
little
bit
concerned
about
the
more
specific
criteria
of
dependency
because
congress
realized
that
there
were
states
that
did
not
permit
alimony
under
state
law.
and
so,
in
response
to
that
problem,
congress
said,
all
right,
we'll
be
even
more
broadly
inclusive
and
we
won't
have
the
specific
criteria
of
dependency
but
we'll
continue
in
effect
the
20-year
marriage
requirement,
subsequently
reduced
to
a
ten-year
marriage
requirement.
if
the
test...
i
think
if
the
test
was,
was
it
really
a
sham
marriage,
it
would
be
a
much
shorter
period
of
time.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
no,
not
as
of
1977,
with
regard
to
survivors'
benefits.
but
as
we
know,
and
i
believe
it's
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief,
divorced
spouses
were
still
being
treated
differently
for
other
purposes;
that
is,
with
regard
to
what
are
called
spouses'
benefits
which
are
benefits
that
a
divorced
spouse
might
receive
when
the
wage
earner
is
still
alive,
the
remarriage
rule
continued,
even
after
1977.
so
that,
in
essence,
congress
in
1977
was
treating
divorced
spouses
more
alike
and
widowed
spouses
more
alike.
before
discussing
these
points
in
a
little
bit
more
detail
and
going
over
two
more
of
the
rational
bases
on
which
congress
acted,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
legal
standard
to
be
applied
in
judging
the
constitutionality
of
congress's
actions
here.
it
seems
clear
that
the
standard
should
be
the
rational
basis
test,
and
district
court
in
this
case
in
fact
applied
the
rational
basis
test.
in
the
context
of
the
social
security
act,
this
court
has
measured
classifications
based
on
divorce,
in
matthews
versus
de
castro,
and
based
on
remarriage
in
califano
versus
jobst,
according
to
a
rational
basis
test,
and
there's
no
reason
to
do
otherwise
here.
the
test,
then,
is
simply
whether
congress's
action
can
be
said
to
manifest
a
patently
arbitrary
classification
utterly
lacking
in
rational
justification,
and
i
think
the
district
court's
error
in
applying
this
test
is
fairly
easy
to
pinpoint,
and
it
goes
to
the
rationale
that
we
have
been
discussing
previously,
rationale
of
differences
in
dependency
between
divorced
spouses
and
widowed
spouses.
the
district
court
seemed
to
believe
that
when
congress
gave
survivors'
benefits
to
divorced
spouses,
it
committed
itself
to
the
position
that
there
was
no
basis
whatsoever
for
distinguishing
between
divorced
spouses
and
widowed
spouses.
but
what
the
district
court
failed
to
recognize
is
what
i've
stated
previously,
that
congress
has
always
treated,
even
in
1977,
has
treated
divorced
and
widowed
spouses
differently,
and
the
fact
that
congress
chose
to
treat
them
the
same
for
purposes
of
initial
eligibility
for
survivors'
benefits
does
not
mean
that
congress
was
requiring
them
to
treat
them
the
same
for
all
purposes.
it
was
rational
for
congress
to
give
effect
to
he
differences
between
the
two
groups
at
the
time
of
remarriage.
i've
discussed
previously
in
answer
to
questions
the
chronology
of
congress's
first
giving
no
benefits
to
divorced
spouses,
thereby
recognizing
the
reality
of
the
legal
severance
of
relationship
at
the
time
of
divorce,
and
then
giving
benefits
to
divorced
spouses
but
using
two
criteria
of
dependency,
20-year
duration
marriage
requirement
plus
some
more
specific
criteria,
and
congress
then
being
concerned
that
the
more
specific
criteria
were
not
working
well
and
retaining
only
the
20-year
marriage
requirement
and
then
reducing
the
20-year
marriage
requirement
to
a
ten-year
marriage
requirement
but
still
retaining
that
as
a
criteria
of
dependency.
but
all
of
this
suggests
that
the
differences
between
divorced
spouses
and
widowed
spouses
have
been
at
least
as
apparent
to
congress
as
their
similarities.
thus,
when
congress
considered
changing
the
rule
that
ended
survivors'
benefits
on
remarriage,
and
when
congress
chose
as
it
did
to
proceed
a
step
at
a
time
with
regard
to
the
elimination
of
this
remarriage
rule,
congress
acted
quite
reasonably
in
eliminating
the
remarriage
rule,
first
for
the
one
category
of
beneficiaries
for
whom
there
had
never
been
a
dependency
test,
and
that
was
widows
and
widowers.
congress
at
the
same
time
then
continued,
in
effect,
the
remarriage
rule
for
all
other
categories
of
beneficiaries,
those
categories
being
categories
where
there
were
dependency
tests
attached
which
was,
as
i've
stated,
not
only
the
surviving
divorced
spouses
but
also
dependent
parents
for
whom
there
was
a
dependency
test,
and
dependent
children
for
whom
there
is
a
dependency
test.
put
another
way,
congress
could
rationally
assume
that
its
concerns
that
had
been
manifested
in
prior
legislation
about
divorced
spouses
who
had
not
worked
during
the
years
when
they
were
married,
could
be
set
aside
on
the
event
of
the
remarriage
of
the
divorced
spouse.
i
would
like
to
briefly
mention
two
other
things
that
can
be
said
about
the
rationality
of
the
distinction
that
congress
chose
here
in
1977.
first
of
all,
as
i
have
alluded
to
very
briefly
earlier,
when
a
divorced
spouse
receives
survivors'
benefits
there
is
a
possibility
that
another
spouse
may
also
be
receiving
benefits
based
on
the
one
wage
earner's
account.
benefits
to
divorced
spouses
are
not
counted
against
the
ceiling
amount
that
may
be
paid
based
on
one
single
wage
earner's
account.
thus,
congress's
decision
to
pay
benefits
to
divorced
spouses
creates
the
potential
for...
and
i
don't
mean
this
pejoratively
but
just
descriptively...
as
sort
of
a
double
dipping
based
on
the
one
wage
earner's
account,
and
this
is
a
special
kind
of
drain
on
the
trust
fund.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
yes.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
that
would
be--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--that's
correct,
although
i
think
as
your
description
of
the
problem
indicates,
it
really
is
best
to
find
by
the
situation
of
looking
where
there's
been
a
divorce.
i
think
that
is
a--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--right.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
that,
i
think,
is
a
better
rational
classification.
of
course
we
don't
have
to...
i
think
the
court
does
not
have
to
look
to
whether
it's
better
or
not,
but
i
think
it's
a
rational
classification
to
look
to
the
situation
where
there
has
been
a
divorce
because
i
think
that
even
creates
the
probability,
not
the
certainty
but
the
probability,
of
this,
what
i've
called
double
dipping.
and
it
seems
clear
that
it
would
be
rational
for
congress
to
pick
the
event
of
the
divorced
spouse's
remarriage
and
this
special
rain
on
the
account
because
at
that
point
congress...
again,
a
new
family
unit
was
formed
and
a
new
basis
for
economic
dependency
accrued
with
the
new
marriage.
finally,
despite
the
appellee's
claim
to
the
contrary,
congress
clearly
was
motivated,
certainly
could
have
been
motivated
by
fiscal
concerns
when
it
acted
in
1977.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
first
of
all
i
do
not
believe
that
the
rational
basis
test
requires
us
to
discern
congress's
actual
motivation,
so
long
as
congress
could
have
rationally
acted
with
this
purpose,
and
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
i
think
as
to
dependency,
congress's
purpose
can
be
discerned
from
the
progress
of
its
concerns
over
the
years
with
regard
to
widowed
spouses.
with
regard
to
its
fiscal
concerns,
what
we
have
is
kind
of...
is
the
progress
of
the
legislation
itself.
the
house
would
have
eliminated
the
remarriage
rule
entirely
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
that
would
have
cost
$1.3
billion
per
year.
the
senate
bill
had
no
provision
in
it
with
regard
to
the
marriage
rule.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
yes,
it
is.
there
is
a
house
committee
report.
the
senate
did
not
consider
the
issue,
and
the
conference
committee
acted
really
without
an
explanation
in
the
conference
report,
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
an
actual
motivation
must
be
discerned
in
order
for
the
court
to
find
that
congress
acted
on
a
rational
basis.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i
couldn't
tell
you
in
all
the
particulars,
but
the
bill
which
passed
the
senate
had
no
provision
in
whatsoever
addressing
the
remarriage
rule.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
i'm
not
certain.
in
sum,
to
just
draw
a
conclusion
with
regard
to
this
fiscal
concern,
i
think
that
the
appellees
have
agreed
that
the...
by
choosing
the
categories
that
it
did
in
1977,
congress
saved
about
$17
million
per
year
and
this
court
should
be
unwilling
to
assume
that
$17
million
per
year
is
simply
too
little
for
congress
rationally
to
be
concerned
about.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
relates
to
the
class
definition.
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
two
groups
of
individuals
that
it
purported
to
include
in
the
class.
first,
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
persons
who
did
not
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies,
and
second,
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
persons
whose
claims
had
already
become
final
when
the
case
was
filed.
in
this
respect
the
district
court
erroneously
included
some
persons
who
had
received
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
more
than
60
days
before
the
case
was
filed.
first,
perhaps
i
should
say
something
about
whether
the
court
needs
to
reach
the
class
certification
issue
if
it
decides
the
constitutional
issue
in
favor
of
the
government.
the
court
in
this
case
does
have
jurisdiction,
indisputably,
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue
because
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
meet
the
405-g
requirements.
in
similar
situations,
that
is
where
there
is
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
some
plaintiffs
in
the
case
but
there
is
a
question
with
regard
to
the
overall
class
certification,
the
court
has
in
some
cases
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government
and
failed
to
decide
the
class
certification
issues,
and
it
did
that
in
califano
versus
boles.
but
in
other
cases
such
as
matthews
versus
diaz,
the
court
has
in
the
very
same
circumstances
gone
on
to
decide
the
class
certification
issue.
and
if
i
may
suggest,
the
court
may
wish
to
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
on
this
issue,
related
issues
with
respect
to
class
certification
arise
in
the
next
case
to
the
argued,
the
city
of
new
york
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
situation
here
would
be
required
to
decide
the
class
issues
because
it
would
need
to
define
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
judgment
that
it
was
entering.
as
i
have
stated,
both
class
issues
relate
to
405-g
which
requires,
first
of
all,
that
there
be
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary
on
a
claim
for
benefits,
and
secondly
that
the
civil
action
be
commenced
within
60
days
of
notice
of
the
secretary's
final
decision
to
the
claimant.
this
court
has
held
that
these
requirements
must
be
satisfied
with
regard
to
each
individual
class
member,
and
the
court
has
so
stated
in
califano
versus
yamasaki.
in
that
case
the
court
emphasized
that
class
relief
is
consistent
with
the
need
for
case
by
case
adjudication,
that
is
evident
in
the
structure
of
405-g,
only
if
every
member
of
the
class
can
meet
individually
the
405-g
requirements.
the
first
requirement
that
was
not
met
here
by
some
of
the
class
members
was
the
requirement
of
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary.
the
district
court
did
not
limit
the
class
to
those
who
had
exhausted
the
entire
administrative
process.
this
court
in
weinberger
versus
salfi
has
held
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
statutorily
required
and
that
it
cannot
be
dispensed
with
by
a
judicial
conclusion
of
finality.
the
secretary
himself
can
make
exceptions
to
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
the
secretary
did
so
in
this
case
with
regard
to
the
individual
claimants,
but
did
so
because
the
secretary
had
reached
the
stage
of
the
administrative
process
where
the
facts
had
been
found,
the
issues
of
law
had
been
determined
insofar
as
the
secretary
could
determine
them,
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
to
be
decided
was
the
constitutional
issue
which
the
secretary
could
not
rule
on.
now,
the
class
members,
however,
had
not
been
through
this
process
and
i
think
that
the
importance
of
exhaustion
can
be
seen
in
this
case
by
looking
at
what
happened
after
the
district
court
decided
the
constitutional
issue.
at
that
point,
the
agency
was
required
to
go
through
the
files
of
the
individual
claimant
and
decide
who
would
qualify
for
the
relief
that
the
court
granted.
this
is
just
the
kind
of
fact
finding
that
is
supposed
to
go
on
before
the
case
goes
to
court.
finally,
the
remaining
issue
concerns
the
requirement
that
a
claimant
file
suit
within
60
days
after
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary.
i
think
that
califano
versus
sanders
holding,
that
motions
to
reopen
are
unreviewable--
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
--well,
it
would
not
be
one
decision.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
everybody
in
the
class
loses.
insofar
as
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction...
insofar
as
the
class
was
improperly
certified
and
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
would
be
as
to
those
persons
who
were
improperly
included
in
the
class.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
what
i'm
saying
is
that
some
of
those
people
who
were
nominally
included
might
be
able
to
come
back
and
make
the
same
claim
later
if
collateral
estoppel
did
not
bind
them,
and
i
think
maybe
more
importantly,
the
secretary
may
well
have
to
go
through
the
fact
finding
in
each
of
these
claims
anyway.
the
persons
may
have
other
bases
on
which
they
would
claim
benefits
and
the
secretary
may
have
other
matters
to
adjudicate
with
regard
to
these
individuals.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
honda
versus
clark,
i'd
like
to
correct
the
statement
that
was
made
with
regard
to
totalling
against
the
government
there.
the
court
specifically
said
in
that
case
that
because
the
government
was
acting
as
a
stakeholder
with
regard
to
property
in
the
office
of
alien
property,
that
the
court
would
allow
totalling.
there
was
no
potential
drain
upon
th
treasury
there
and
it
was
an
exception
to
the
usual
rule
with
regard
to
the
government
which
is
not
at
all
applicable
here.
appellees
state
that
the
secretary
is
trying
to
restrict
the
size
of
the
class,
but
with
all
due
respect
it
is
congress
that
has
set
forth
the
scheme
under
section
405-g
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
yamasaki
and
ringer
that
congress
wants
these
benefits
determinations
to
go
forward
on
an
individual
basis
and
wants
the
legal
issues
to
be
raised
in
an
individual
context.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
it
would
not...
we
would
not
consider
it
a
question
of
totalling.
if
someone
has
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary
within
60
days
before
the
suit
is
filed,
it's
not
really
a
question
of
totalling
but
rather
that
in
lieu
of
filing
a
separate
action
they
may
be
considered
to
have
filed
vis-a-vis
that
action,
and
that's
the
basis.
ms.
carolyn
b.
kuhl
yes.
we
have
not
raised
anything
to
the
contrary
in
this
case.
the
point
here
on
the
exhaustion
and
60-day
principles
is
that
we're
dealing
with
individuals
who
did
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
administrative
process
but
didn't.
they
let
their
claims
become
final.
it
was
res
judicata,
and
what
appellees
are
asking
for
here
is
that
this
court
recognize
the
principle
that
allows
continuous
correction
process
to
occur
with
regard
to
the
system,
and
that
is
not
at
all
what
congress
had
in
mind.
these
individuals
gave
no
indication
that
they
wanted
further
review.
at
each
stage
of
the
four-stage
administrative
process
there
is
a
notice
sent
stating,
if
you
wish
further
review
file
within
60
days.
the
people
who
are
included
in
the
class
here
who
should
not
have
been
did
not
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity.
the
rule
that
they
are
asking
for
here
is
almost
as
if
they
are
asking
that
when
a
court
of
appeals
creates
a
new
rule
of
law,
district
court
people
who
didn't
think
to
raise
the
argument
and
who
have...
had
their
cases
decided
be
allowed
to
re-open
them
over
and
over.
thank
you.
