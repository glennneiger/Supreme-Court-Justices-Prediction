mr.
burns,
may
i
ask,
is
there
some
kind
of
agreement
which
provides
a
five-year
moratorium
on
whaling
ending
in
1990?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
japanese
agreement,
if
there
is
a
reversal...
you
have
said
that
japan
would
be
out
of
the
whaling
business
in
1988?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
that,
or
are
they
simply
going
to
abide
by
the
moratorium
which
as
i
understood
it,
by
its
terms
ends
in
1990?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
was,
what
is
it
japan
has
agreed
to
do
in
1988,
get
out
of
whaling
entirely,
or
simply
to
abide
by
the
moratorium
until
its
termination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
1988?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
in
1990,
or
whatever
the
termination--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
resume
after
1990?
