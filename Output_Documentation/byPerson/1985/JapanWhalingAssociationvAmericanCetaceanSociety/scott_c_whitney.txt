mr.
scott
c.
whitney
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
japanese
petitioners
agree
essentially
with
the
argument
you
have
just
heard.
however,
we
diverge
from
both
the
federal
petitioners
and
the
respondents
on
two
issues
that
i'd
like
to--
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
--the
japanese
petitioners
agree
with
the
presentation,
essentially
with
the
presentation
we've
just
heard
by
the
federal
petitioners.
however,
we
diverge
from
both
the
federal
petitioners
and
the
respondents
on
two
issues
which
i
would
like
to
devote
my
time
to
discussing.
before
doing
so,
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
couple
of
matters.
justice
brennan,
you
asked
about
the
moratorium.
the
moratorium
that
was
established
will
continue
indefinitely
unless
the
international
whaling
commission
in
1990,
based
upon
scientific
evidence,
decides
that
whale
stocks
are
at
a
sufficiently
high
level
to
permit
the
resumption
of
whaling.
and
it
is
partly
a
reflection
of
that
fact,
why
the
murazumi-baldridge
agreement
was
to
the
advantage
of
the
preservation
of
whales,
because
the
japanese
would
cease
whaling,
will
cease
whaling,
if
the
agreement
is
not
stricken
down,
as
of
april
1,
1988.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
only
if
the
international
whaling
commission
dissolves
the
moratorium,
a
point
which
my
predecessor
pointed
out,
is
highly
unlikely
since
the
international
whaling
commission
normally
votes
37
or
something
to
one
on
the
subject.
so,
the
moratorium
for
practical
purposes
will
continue
indefinitely.
the
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
clarify,
justice
blackmun,
is
the
matter
of
the
whaling
populations.
those
figures
are
given
in
the
first
portion,
pages
3,
4
and
5
of
the
japanese
petitioner's
reply
brief,
and
they
give
you
two
sets
of
figures.
the
figures
which
are
espoused
by
the
preservationist
ultras,
which
naturally
tend
to
be
somewhat
lower
than
the
figures
which
have
been
adduced
and
compiled
by
the
united
states
government
pursuant
to
the
marine
mammal
act,
which
are
substantially
larger,
but
you
will
find
the
particulars
there
and
the
citation
of
authority.
the
bottom
line
is,
as
to
the
whales,
the
species
of
whales
which
are
involved
in
the
murazumi-baldridge
agreement,
all
three
species
are
robust
populations.
there
is
a
good
deal
of
apocalyptic
discussion
in
the
respondent's
brief
about
moby
dick
and
blue
whales
and
white
whales,
but
they
are
irrelevant
to
this
proceeding.
they
are
not
encompassed
in
the
murazumi-baldridge
agreement.
the
first
issue--
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
no,
sir.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
they
are
the
subject
of
independent
protection,
protective
measures,
and
there
have
been...
there
has
been
no
taking
of
those
species
of
whales
for
a
very
long
time.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
indeed,
this
is
only
indirect
but
one
of
the
concerns
is
the
rapid
increase
in
the
minke
whale
population
which
is
a
species
involved
in
this
agreement,
is
endangering
the
survival
of
the
blue
whale
by
encroaching
on
their
feeding.
now,
we
have
a
major
difference
concerning
the
relationship
between
the
treaty,
the
international
convention
for
the
regulation
of
whaling,
and
these
two
statutes.
we...
there
is
no
dispute
that
whenever
a
signatory
to
the
convention
exercises
its
rights
under
article
53,
that
has
the
legal
effect
of
exempting
the
party
from
any...
from
whatever
act
the
iwc
has
taken
to
which
they
object.
the
question
then
becomes,
having
exempted
themselves
under
the
treaty
by
an
exercise
of
an
absolute
and
unqualified
treaty
right,
can
that
act
of
objecting
be
treated
as
an
act
which
diminishes
the
effectiveness
of
the
treaty?
because,
only
if
the
exercise
of
this
unqualified
right
can
be
shown
to
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
treaty,
are
the
statutes--
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
--i'm
not
terribly
sure
they
could
do
that
as
to
foreign
nationals.
but
the
point
is
that
they
have
taken
a
position,
actually
it
was
the
united
states
government
that
continually
insists
on
such
an
objection
mechanism
in
all
multilateral
treaties
in
which
they
participate.
we
cite
the
example
that
the
nonparticipation
of
the
united
states
in
the
law
of
the
seas
treaty
came
about
because
there
was
not
an
escape
clause
provision
in
it.
the
theory,
behind
it,
it
sounds--
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
--yes,
sir.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
it
was,
i
think
fair
to
say,
not
even
considered.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
only
indirectly.
it
comes
about
in
response
to
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
moratorium
and
the
zero
quota,
which
were
enacted,
were
in
fact
enacted
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
itself,
and
that
is
the
other
portion
of
the
treaty.
article
52
requires
that
the
iwc
meet
four
specific
requirements.
the
language
is
mandatory.
nobody
has
contested
the
fact
that
this
is
mandatory.
and
no
one
has
also
contested
that
the
particular
moratorium
of
the
zero
quota
that
are
in
issue
here
were
in
fact
adopted
in
violation
of
article
52,
particularly
adopted
in
violation
of
the
provision
that
requires
that
the
quota,
the
zero
quota,
be
based
upon
scientific
evidence.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
yes,
that's
the
point
i
am
striving
to
make,
is
that
it
is
inherently
paradoxical
and
self-contradictory
to
conclude,
we
submit,
that
the
exercise
of
an
unqualified
treaty
right
to
object
somehow
diminishes
the
effectiveness
of
the
treaty
which
propounds
and
endows
that
unqualified
right.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
well,
that's...
i
take
it
that
does
embrace
the
convention
that
we're
talking
about.
no
one,
at
least,
has
challenged
that
point
up
to
this
time.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
i'm
sorry?
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
no,
sir.
what
i
was
indicating
was
that
the
zero
quota
and
the
moratorium
adopted
by
the
iwc
was
without
dispute
adopted
in
violation
of
article
52.
it
was
indeed
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
objection
was
lodged.
now,
the
court
below
does
not
dispute
this,
the
fact
that...
the
point
is
that
in
this
language
the
court
below,
or
i
take
it
the
respondents,
do
not
contend
that
congress
ever
explicitly
stated
that
if
you
exercise
this
right
that
you
will
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
treaty
because
to
do
so
abrogates
that
provision
of
the
treaty.
the
court
below
instead
adopted
a
position
which
we
call
the
coercion
theory
of
treaty
enforcement.
under
this
theory
the
court
below
held
that
there...
that
the
domestic
statutes
provide
enforcement
leverage
to
coerce
parties
to
the
treaty
not
to
exercise
their
right
to
object,
and
they
make
the
corollary
point
that
there's
nothing
in
the
treaty
that
prohibits
the
united
states
from
using
the
threat
of
economic
force
to
coerce
a
signatory
not
to
exercise
is
rights
to
become
exempt.
we
suggest
that
this
is...
merely
to
state
that
proposition
is
to
show
that
it's
an
essentially
unsound
and
i
think
immoral
concept,
that
the
united
states
who
is
the
author
and
who
insists
on
having
this
kind
of
a
provision,
and
frequently
has
used
it...
in
fact,
has
not
gone
into
treaties
when
that
provision
was
not
there,
can
selectively
use
the
threat
of
economic
force
to
coerce
another
nation
not
to
exercise
its
rights
and
thereby
exempt
itself
accordingly.
mr.
scott
c.
whitney
thank
you,
sir.
