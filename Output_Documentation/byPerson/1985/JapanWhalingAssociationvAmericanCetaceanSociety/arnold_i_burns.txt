mr.
arnold
i.
burns
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
too
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
an
executive
agreement
between
two
sovereign
nations,
the
united
states
and
japan,
the
practical
effect
of
which
is
to
end
whaling
by
japanese
nationals
no
later
than
april
1,
1988,
is
to
be
nullified
by
an
interpretation
of
two
federal
statutes
known
as
the
pelly
amendment
and
the
packwood
amendment,
which
strips
the
executive
branch,
of
any
and
all
discretion
and
mandates,
mandates
severe
economic
sanctions
against
japan,
a
country
whose
nationals
take
whales
in
excess
of
the
harvest
quotas
established
by
the
international
whaling
commission.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
pursuant
to
which
congress
directed
the
executive
branch
to
implement
and
to
execute
the
law,
and
i
think
that
you'll
find
that
as
the
argument
progresses,
justice
white,
there's
been
a
very
happy
collaboration
between
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
which
has
together
made
tremendous
strides
over
the
years
in
the
conservation
and
protection
of
whales.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
no,
you
wouldn't,
but
i
shall
try
to
embellish
that
point
as
we
proceed.
the
pelly
amendment,
the
principal
statute,
provides,
and
i
should
like
to
quote
it:
"when
the
secretary
of
commerce
determines
that
nationals
of
a
foreign
country,
directly
or
indirectly,
are
conducting
fishing
operations
in
a
manner
or
under
circumstances
which
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
an
international
fishery
conservation
program,
the
secretary
of
commerce
shall
certify
such
fact
to
the
president.
"
now,
if
there
is
a
certification,
then
the
statute
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
president
may
direct
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
prohibit
the
bringing
or
importation
of
fish
from
the
offending
country
into
the
united
states.
now,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case,
we
all
agree,
that
that
portion
of
the
statute
dealing
with
the
president's
authority
is
purely
discretionary.
the
packwood
amendment,
enacted
in
1979,
eight
years
after
the
pelly
amendment
was
enacted,
contains
a
similar
certification
provision.
under
the
packwood
amendment,
if
there
is
indeed
a
certification,
then
the
secretary
of
commerce,
working
with
the
secretary
of
state,
must...
must
reduce
the
amount
of
fish
by
at
least
50
percent
that
the
offending
country
can
take
from
united
states
fishery
waters.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--yes,
but
as
the
court
below
found
and
as
i
think
we
all
agree,
the
language
which
i
quoted
in
the
pelly
amendment
is
the
language
which
the
court
must
address
in
this
case.
there
is
no
issue
but
that
the
sanction
in
the
packwood
amendment
is
a
mandatory
sanction.
we
all
agree.
the
national
whaling
commission,
created
by
the
international
convention
for
the
regulation
of
whaling,
by
the
adoption
of
schedules
among
other
things
imposed
a
zero
quota
for
the
harvesting
of
sperm
whales
effective
in
april
of
1984,
and
adopted
a
complete
moratorium
on
all
commercial
whaling
to
be
effective
in
april
of
1986,
this
very
month.
japan
filed
timely
objections
to
these
schedules,
and
as
a
consequence
under
international
law
is
not
bound
to
abide
by
them.
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
case
about
that.
on
november
13th,
1984,
following
extensive
negotiations
in
which
the
united
states
made
it
very
clear
to
japan
that
sanctions
under
these
amendments
were
definitely
in
the
cards,
the
united
states
and
japan
struck
a
deal.
in
exchange
for
japan's
pledge
to
assiduously
adhere
to
new
quotas
that
were
established
in
respect
of
sperm
whales,
minke
whales
and
bryde's
whales,
in
the
interim,
japan
would
definitely
give
up
all
commercial
whaling
by
april
of
1988.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
minke
whale.
it
is
a
smaller
whale,
your
honor.
there
are
in
the
world
today
one
million,
roughly,
sperm
whales,
roughly
300,000
minke
whales,
and
roughly
30,000
bryde's
whales.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
well,
they...
believe
it
or
not,
justice
blackmun,
there
is
methodology
for
determining
that.
it's
not
precise,
but
it's
fairly-good.
and
those
statistics
i
gave
you
come
from
the
department
of
commerce,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
right.
now,
japan...
the
united
states
in
exchange
for
japan's
commitment
promised
that
it
would
not
certify
japan.
respondents,
a
coalition
of
private--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--i
classify
it
as
an
executive
agreement
between
two
sovereign
nations,
justice
white,
binding
on
both.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
no,
it
was
negotiated
and
signed
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
on
the
one
hand,
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
state,
and
a
diplomat,
an
authorized
diplomat
of
the
japanese
government.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
oh,
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
one
judge
dissenting,
affirmed
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
compelling
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
certify
japan,
thus
triggering
the
discretionary
sanctions
of
pelly
and
the
mandatory
sanctions
of
packwood,
a
square
holding
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
in
these
circumstances
had
absolutely
no
discretion
in
the
certification
procedure,
and
that
any
departure
from
the
harvest
quotas
adopted
by
the
international
whaling
commission
in
any
circumstances
would
per
se
constitute
a
diminishment
of
the
effectiveness
of
this
international
arrangement
requiring
this
mandatory
sanction
in
the
packwood
amendment.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
in
so
many
words.
they
held
that
it
was
a
per
se
violation.
now,
if
the
decision--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--we
have
difficulty,
jurisdictional
difficulty,
which
we
argue
in
our
reply
brief
after
the
issue
was
raised
by
respondents
on
the
issue
of
standing
in
the
case
to
begin
with.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
i
think
under
appropriate
circumstances,
it
would,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
if
the
decision
below
is
reversed
and
the
international
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
japan,
which
is
the
single
most
important
whaling
nation
in
the
world,
if
that
decision
below
is
reversed
all
whaling
by
japanese
nationals
will
surely
end
by
april
1,
1988.
if
the
decision
below
is
affirmed,
the
international
agreement
will
be
nullified.
severe
economic
sanctions
will
be
issued
against
japan.
and,
importantly,
the
taking
of
whales
will
be
exactly
where
it
was
before
this
all
started,
namely,
completely
and
totally
up
in
the
air.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
oh,
yes,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you
will
find
as
one
goes
through
this
record
that
there
have
been
six
instances
in
which
certifications
have
taken
place,
five
of
them
under
the
pelly
amendment,
and
in
each
of
those
five
instances
involving
japan
and
the
soviet
union,
korea,
chile
and
peru,
sanctions
that
were
issued
because
when
we
brought
them
to
the
bargaining
table
the
countries
involved
fell
into
line
and
in
each
instance
joined
the
international
whaling
commission.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
justice
blackmun,
there
are
three
instances
in
which
certification
has
not
taken
place,
one
in
1979
involving
spain,
one
in
1980
involving
taiwan,
and
one
i
believe
in
1982
involving
chile.
in
two
of
those
instances
there
was
not
a
clear
and
definite
showing
that
there
had
been
a
harvest
quota
violation,
but
there
was
clear
evidence
that
they
were
heading
for
it.
but
the
issue
was
averted
by
negotiation
and
diplomacy.
in
the
third
case
involving
chile,
there's
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
harvest
quota,
and
there
was
no
certification.
to
date
there
has
been
only
one
certification
involving
mandatory
sanctions
and
that
involved
a
certification
of
the
soviet
union
just
a
year
ago,
in
april
of
1985.
the
principal
point
that
i
wish
to
make--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--and
with
specific
reference
to
that,
we
need
not
speculate
and
we
need
not
conjecture,
justice
blackmun.
we
know
the
answer
to
that.
first
of
all,
respondents
argue
that
this
language,
despite
the
fact
that
it
drips
with
words
of
discretion,
really
is
clear-cut
and
mandatory.
the
problem
is
that
they
do
not
really
say
that.
they
say
that
the
language
of
this
statute
sometimes
is
mandatory
and
ministerial
and
wholly
lacking
in
discretion,
and
at
other
times
it
is
fully
discretionary
and
they
do
not
tell
us
or
enlighten
us
where
the
metaphysical
distinction
is.
let
me
explain.
there
are
many
matters
which
are
the
subject
of
the
adoption
of
schedules.
in
addition
to
harvest
quotas
you
have
prescriptions
against
taking
female
whales,
taking
suckling
whales,
taking...
there
are
prescriptions
against
taking
calves,
there
are
prescriptions
against
taking
whales
in
certain
geographical
areas.
there
are
prescriptions
against
using
certain
kinds
of
harpoons.
in
all
of
those
instances,
as
i
understand
respondent's
argument
and
there
is
a
concession
to
this
effect
in
the
brief,
and
the
court
below
has
conceded
that
in
those
circumstances
under
this
very
same
language
you
would
have
discretion,
and
the
secretary
of
commerce
felt
that
under
the
same
language
where
you
have
a
harvest
quota
violation,
there
would
be
no
such
discretion.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
there
is
a,
today
a
moratorium
in
force
without
any
termination
date.
it
is
not
finite.
there
is
today--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
they
will
abide
by
the
moratorium,
but
there
are
41
nations
in
the
international
whaling
commission,
justice
brennan,
only
eight
of
whom
are
whaling
nations.
there
is
practically
no
chance
whatsoever
that
that
moratorium
will
be
changed.
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--they
have
agreed
to
abide
by
the
moratorium
and
as
a
practical
matter,
we
say,
the
secretary
of
commerce
says,
the
secretary
of
state
says,
that
this
amounts
to
a
cessation
of
commercial
whaling.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
yes,
in
1988.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
april
of
1988,
at
the
end
of
the
coastal
whaling
season
which
ends
april
of
1988.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
no,
it
was
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
well,
i
do
know
what--
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
--no,
i
know
more
than
that,
and
i'd
like
to
share
it
with
you
if
i
may,
justice
marshall.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
yes,
it
is.
you'll
find
this
at
footnote
46
at
pages
37
and
38
of
our
principal
brief.
at
the
time,
in
1979,
this
is
what
was
said
concerning
the
pelly
amendment.
now,
the
question
must
be
asked,
what
did
congress
have
in
mind
when
they
adopted
the
packwood
amendment.
they
may...
they
provided
for
mandatory
sanctions
at
that
time.
what
did
congress
have
in
mind?
and
the
answer
to
the
question
is
very
clear.
what
congress
had
in
mind
was,
in
adding
teeth
and
giving
the
executive
branch
additional
negotiating
chips
at
the
bargaining
table,
and
the
idea
was
that
after
the
packwood
amendment
took
place,
that
offending
nations
or
nations
that
might
become
offending
nations,
would
no
longer
have
two
bites
at
the
apple.
they
would
only
have
one
bite
at
the
negotiating
apple.
and,
that
is
not
conjecture
on
my
part,
because
representative
brow
said,
"i
understand
under
the
pelly
amendment
as
it
exists
there
are
really
two
areas
in
which
there
are
optional
actions
that
can
be
taken
by
the
administration.
"
"first,
in
certifying
that
a
country
is
in
violation
of
some
international
agreement,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
flexibility
in
that
certification.
"
"and
second,
after
a
nation
is
certified,
there
is
still
discretion
in
determining
whether
a
ban
on
imports
of
that
country's
products
will
be
in
fact
imposed
against
that
country.
"
therefore,
under
pelly
we
have
two
discretionary
features,
whereas
in
the
packwood
amendment
you
are
really
taking
all
of
the
discretionary
features
and
putting
them
into
their
first
category
which
is
the
certification
of
a
nation
being
in
violation
of
an
international
agreement.
that
tells
us
precisely
what
they
had
in
mine.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
it
means
that
japan
has
the
right
under
international
law,
under
the
international
compact
originally
entered
into
once
they
filed
the
objection
to
ignore
the
compact.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
well,
the
point
is
that
japan
in
this
case
clearly
would
have
been
violating
and
departing
from
the
schedules
adopted,
but
was
persuaded
not
to
follow
that
course
and
an
agreement
was
struck
whereby
they
would
take,
starting
now,
for
example,
1986
through
1988,
200
sperm
whales
in
each
of
those
two
years.
they
have
taken
400
sperm
whales
in
this
last
year.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
the
effect
of
that
would
be
that
absent
the
negotiation,
absent
sitting
down
at
a
table,
absent
an
agreement,
japan
would
be
whaling
and
continue
to
take
whales
without
limitation,
subject
solely
to
its
own
determination,
subject
only
to
its
own
discretion.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
and
subject
to
the
availability
of
sanctions
under
both
the
pelly
amendment
and
the
packwood
amendment.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
there's
no
doubt
that
they
thought
they
were
serious.
it
was
the
threat
and
the
fact
that
sanctions
were
clearly
in
the
cards.
the
record
shows
that
they
were
told
that,
that
persuaded
japan
not
to
follow
that
course
but
to
join
in
the
community
of
nations
and
to
leave
seven
whaling
nations
instead
of
eight.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
you
can,
we
think,
rely
on
japan's
good
faith,
and
second,
you
always
have
the
clout
which
can
be
reimposed
at
any
time,
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
enforcement
methodology.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
the
original
agreement
between
the
two
sovereign
nations,
yes.
i
mean,
there
isn't
a
lawyer
who
has
been
trained
or
born
who
can
draw
an
agreement
that
will
protect
against
bad
faith.
we
do
not
think
that
is
in
this
case.
mr.
arnold
i.
burns
thank
you,
chief
justice.
the
secretary
in
this
case
did
indeed
make
a
finding
and
did
indeed
make
a
determination.
he
said
after
consulting
with
reputable
scientists,
after
consulting
with
our
united
states
representative
to
the
international
whaling
commission,
and
after
consulting
with
the
secretary
of
state
on
some
delicate
foreign
policy
considerations,
he
said,
and
this
is
in
our
addendum
3
at
page
6-a,
and
i
quote,
"i
believe
that
a
cessation
of
all
japanese
commercial
whaling
activities
would
contribute
more
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
international
whaling
commission
and
its
conservation
program
than
any
other
single
development.
"
we
rely
on
plain
language
which
clearly
gives
him
discretion.
the
congress
had
three
opportunities
to
tell
us
that
he
was
not
to
have
that
discretion.
in
1971
when
they
passed
the
pelly
amendment,
and
we
too
have
challenged
our
adversaries
to
show
us
legislative
history,
language
to
the
contrary,
they
have
not
done
so.
in
1978
the
pelly
amendment
itself
was
amended
and
it
is
very
clear
that
the
congress,
and
our
papers
demonstrate,
regarded
this
as
a
discretionary
matter.
in
1979
when
the
packwood
amendment
came
up,
congress
had
the
perfect
opportunity
to
take
the
middle
man
out
of
the
process.
there
was
no
need
to
have
the
secretary
of
commerce.
they
could
have
written
the
law
to
say
very
clearly
that
where
there
is
a
violation
of
international
harvest
quotas
under
the
international
whaling
commission,
that
is
ipso
facto
a
violation.
senator
packwood
introduced
such
a
bill.
it
did
not
pass.
so
that,
we
have
a
very
clear
legislative
history
showing
that
congress
never
did
restrict
the
secretary
in
implementing
its,
congress's,
statute
in
areas
involving
enormous
expertise,
environmental
law,
conservation
dynamics,
and
foreign
policy.
thank
you
so
much.
