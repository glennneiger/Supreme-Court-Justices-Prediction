mr.
burns,
may
i
inquire
what
the
effect
is
of
the
fact
that
japan
objected
to
the
quotas,
and
therefore
under
the
terms
of
the
act
is
not
bound
by
them?
does
that
mean
that
japan
is
not
in
violation
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
fact
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
imposition
or
determination
to
impose
sanctions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
is
there
any
effect
at
all
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
japan
objected
to
the
quotas
and
therefore
supposedly
wasn't
bound
by
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
legislative
history
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
pelly
amendment
rather
than
later?
your
comments
have
really
been
directed
to
hearings
conducted,
as
i
understand
it,
before
adoption
of
the
packwood
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
the
language
that
one
would
have
to
look
at
is
the
language
that
says,
when
the
secretary
of
commerce
determines
that
the
fishing
operations
are
being
conducted
in
a
manner
or
under
circumstances
which
diminish,
all
that
language--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
is
perhaps
not
necessarily
definitive,
doesn't
admit
of
the
certainty
that
you
speak
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
know
it's
not
this
case,
but
suppose
that
it
were
determined
or
alleged
that
a
nation
had
taken
a
single
whale
by
mistake.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
after
that
moratorium.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
still
haven't
mentioned
anything
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
pelly
amendment,
i
noticed.
