justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting,
then,
if
congress
clearly
intended
to
do
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
know
that
from
the
brief
that
the
congress
has
filed
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with,
or
we're
dealing
with
the
two
of
them
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
classify
that
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
negotiated
and
signed
by
the
secretary
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
cabinet
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
subject
to
sanction?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
might
think
were
serious?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
they
involved
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
involved
at
all
in
this
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
limits
on
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
any
treaty
at
all,
i
suppose
congress
could
limit...
could
impose
some
limits
on
the
taking
of
whales
in
certain
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this...
was
this
presented
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
among
the
questions
presented
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
remove
the
discretion
of
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
remove
the
discretion
of
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
what
was
the
alleged
failure
to
comply
this
time?
was
it
whaling
at
all?
was
it
violating
the
moratorium
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
wasn't,
for
example,
you
took
51
whales
rather
than
your
quota
of
50,
it
was
taking
any
whales?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
moratorium?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
should
have
taken
any
whales?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
can't
be...
he
has
no
authority
to
certify
unless
he
makes
that
determination,
so
if
he
certifies
he
has
to
say
there
is
a
diminishment
of
the
fishery?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
secretary
should
not
have
purported
to
permit
another
country
to
take
a
certain
number
of
whales
contrary
to
the
moratorium?
