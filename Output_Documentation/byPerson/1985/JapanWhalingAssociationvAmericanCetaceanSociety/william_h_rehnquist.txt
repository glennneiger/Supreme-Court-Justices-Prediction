justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
majority,
general
burns,
hold
out
in
so
many
words
that
last...
that
any
violation
of
the
harvest
quotas
would
be
a
diminishment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
whitney,
the
pelly
amendment,
as
i
read
that
section
1,
doesn't
talk
about
violation
of
a
treaty.
it
says,
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
an
international
fishery
conservation
program.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
pelly
amendment
doesn't
say
"treaty".
it
says,
international
fishery
conservation
program.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogers,
a
couple
times
you
referred
to
diminishing
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention,
which
i
realize
is
the
language
of
the
packwood
amendment,
but
the
pelly
amendment
says,
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
an
international
fishery
conservation
program.
is
that
of
any
significance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogers,
all
i
have
before
me
is
the
language
of
the
pelly
and
packwood
amendments
set
forth
in
addendum
1
to
the
brief
for
the
federal
petitioner.
but
looking
at
the
small...
this
is
about
the
packwood
amendment...
a,
small
roman...
no,
i
guess
b,
i'm
sorry.
it
says,
"if
the
secretary
issues
a
certification
with
respect
to
any
foreign
country
then
each
allocation
under
paragraph.
"
--what
does
the
word
"allocation"
refer
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we're
not
talking
about
imports?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
talking--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
availability
of
mandamus
in
your
oral
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
the
mandamus
doesn't
issue
in
a
case
where
someone
has
exceeded
their
authority.
it's
issues
in
a
case
where
they
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
a
particular
course
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
we
don't
have
many
cases
where
a
writ
of
mandamus
has
been
issued
to
a
cabinet
officer,
and
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
