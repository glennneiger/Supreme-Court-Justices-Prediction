justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
litigation.
does
your
side
concede
that
there's
a
private
cause
of
action
under
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
am
not
asking
about
standing.
i
am
asking
if...
do
you
think
this
statute
includes
a
private
cause
of
action
for
the...
for
a
private
citizen,
enforceable
by
private
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
language
of
the
statute
that
troubles
me
a
little.
there
are
in
fact
two
parts,
one,
he
must
determine;
and
if
he
determines,
he
must
certify.
and
the
language,
"to
certify",
is
mandatory.
is
it
your
position
that
the
order
should
compel
him
to
make
a
determination
he
has
not
yet
made,
or
that
he
should
certify
a
determination
that
he
has
already
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
if
he
has
made
a
determination,
but
we
treat
it
as
though
it
is
so
clear,
that
the
facts
are
there,
that
he
must
certify
that
he
has
made
a
determination
even
if
he
hasn't?
apparently
he
hasn't
made
a
determination--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
to
say,
"i
have
determined
that"--
