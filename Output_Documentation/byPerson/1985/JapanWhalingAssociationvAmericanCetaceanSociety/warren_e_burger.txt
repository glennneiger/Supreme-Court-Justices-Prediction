mr.
burns,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.

would
those
sanctions
be
the
sanctions
that
were
in
the
wind,
in
the
offing,
two
years
ago
when
the
bargain
was
struck?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
basic
agreement
doesn't
seem
to
have
much
binding
effect
to
it;
at
least,
it
permits
a
great
deal
of
dilatory
tactics
here,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meanwhile,
two
or
three
years
of
crops
of
whales
are
taken
contrary
to
the
intent,
at
least
the
basic
intent
of
the
original
agreement?

e.

mr.

chief

e.

would
you
like
to
raise
the
lectern.
we
aren't...
the
other
way
might
make
it...
then
you'd
get
the
benefit
of
those
microphones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief

e.
burger
mr.
rogers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
would
not
say
that
it's
wholly
divergent
from
foreign
policy
considerations,
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
burns,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
