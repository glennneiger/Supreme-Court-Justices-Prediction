mr.
william
d.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
judgment
there
is
one
issue
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
what
the
law
is,
what
congress
said.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
about
a
number
of
other
interesting
issues
which
are
not,
i
think,
except
by
the
most
attenuated
notions
strictly
legal,
such
as
whale
populations.
mr.
whitney
has
cited
gross
numbers
for
global
populations
but
has
not
suggested
to
the
court
that
they
may
be
misleading
with
respect
to
the
capacity
of
whale
populations
in
subgroups
to
maintain
their
levels.
there
is
considerable
dispute
amongst
scientists
about
that
question.
there
is
also
the
question
mr.
whitney
has
brought
forward,
whether
the
commission
violated
its
own
conventions,
which
i
am
not
sure
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
issue
of
whether
japan
has
committed
itself
to
stop
whaling,
i'd
remind
the
court
that
in
the
baldridge-murazumi
agreement
the
sole
commitment
japan
made
was
to
withdraw
its
objections
to
the
moratorium
and
quotas
established
by
the
commission.
but
that
leaves
before
japan
the
possibility
of
scientific
whaling,
aboriginal
whaling
and
in
the
end,
if
it
chooses'
to,
the
withdrawal
from
the
convention,
by
which
time
the
lever
now
exercised
by
the
united
states
under
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment
of
exclusion
from
the
u.s.
fishing
zone
will,
as
the
baldridge
affidavit
in
this
very
case
points
out,
be
considerably
less
significant
to
japan
because
of
the
fact
that
american
fishermen
will
have
occupied
the
available
take
in
the
200-mile
limit
toward
the
close
of
this
decade.
in
any
event,
we
have
suggested
these
are
not
the
central
issues
before
the
court.
the
central
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
secretary
had
the
discretion
he
purported
to
exercise
here
to
agree
not
to
impose
the
sanction
under
packwood-magnuson
in
which
all
sides
agree
is
mandatory
when
there
is
a
certification.
the
issue,
whether
or
not
sanctions
should
be
mandatory
or
should
be
the
subject
of
extensive
negotiation
and
diplomatic
accommodation
has
been
an
issue
present
in
the
debates
over
congressional
regulation
of
whaling
from
the
very
beginning.
in
1971,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
pelly
amendment
was
passed
providing
for
a
discretionary
sanction
of
banning
imports
when
the
secretary
determined
that
there
was
an
action
diminishing
the
effectiveness
of
the
international
whaling
system.
in
that
year,
i
might
point
out,
congress
also
enacted
resolutions
for
the
first
time
favoring
a
worldwide
moratorium
on
whaling.
in
our
judgment,
the
language
of
pelly
is
quite
persuasive
to
the
proposition
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
had
no
discretion
with
respect
to
the
first
stage
of
the
process;
that
is
to
say,
the
stage
with
respect
to
certification,
and
that
congress
clearly
incorporated
what
it
thought
then
to
be
appropriate
discretion
with
respect
to
the
second
stage
of
the
process,
that
is,
whether
or
not
to
impose
sanctions.
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
appropriateness
of
that
interpretation
of
pelly,
that
is
to
say
mandatory
on
stage
one
with
respect
to
certification,
optional
or
discretionary
with
respect
to
sanctions
in
stage
two,
in
our
judgment
that
doubt
is
entirely
removed
by
first
the
eight-year
history
of
administrative
implementation
of
the
statute
because,
as
mr.
burns
has
pointed
out,
there
were
five
certifications
which
occurred
between
the
time
pelly
was
enacted
and
the
time
congress
considered
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment.
during
that
eight-year
period
in
every
instance,
as
far
as
congress
was
aware
in
1979,
in
every
instance
in
which
a
nation
had
violated
a
numerical
quota
on
taking,
the
secretary
acted
quickly
and
automatically
and
certified
to
the
president
that
a
taking
had
occurred
which
diminished
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention.
and
indeed,
president
ford
made
the
point
crystal-clear
in
his
explanation
of
the
certification
of
japan
and
the
soviet
union
in
1974
when
he
said,
whether
or
not
the
objection
by
the
violating
nation
to
the
quota
is
legal
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
exceeding
quotas
will
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention.
it
constitutes,
then,
he
said,
a
prima
facie
case;
that
is
to
say,
a
case
which
should
suggest
to
the
president
the
exercise
of
his
discretionary
authority
to
impose
the
sanction.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
the
reason
for...
the
reason,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
the
distinction
in
language
was
that
the
pelly
amendment
was
first
drafted
to
include,
most
importantly,
the
north
atlantic
salmon
regulatory
system
so
that
the
broader
term,
"international
fishery
system",
was
used,
but
it's
clear
that
congress
meant
to
include
in
pelly
the
whaling
convention
system
as
well,
for
the
legislative
history.
but
packwood-magnuson,
as
you
can
see,
was
specifically
targeted
on
whaling.
so
too
in
1978,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
compliance
had
already
begun
to
occur
by
chile,
peru
and
south
korea,
and
yet
because
of
their
violations
the
secretary
automatically
issued
the
certification.
in
all
five
cases,
however,
the
executive
branch
stayed
its
hand,
it
did
not
impose
the
pelly
sanctions.
it
did
not
intrude
on
imports
of
fish
products
into
the
united
states
as
it
was
authorized
to
do
under
pelly.
and,
this
is
precisely
what
led
to
the
1979
pakwood-magnuson
amendment.
i
should
add
that
in--
mr.
william
d.
rogers
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
d.
rogers
precisely.
the
discretion
that
the
president
had
consistently
exercised
at
phase
two
of
the
process,
that
is
to
say,
the
imposition
of
sanctions.
the
congressional
consideration
of
the
matter
is
crystal-clear
in
my
judgment.
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
two
very
extensive
hearings
held
by
the
fisheries
subcommittee
of
the
merchant
marine
and
fisheries
committee
in
the
house,
at
which
there
was
ample
testimony
both
with
respect
to
the
eight
years
of
practice
of
automatic
certification
and
the
fact
that
there
is
not
one
hint
of
any
suggestion
that
anyone
conceived
that
there
was
any
discretion
buried
in
the
"diminish
the
effectiveness'
language,
in
stage
one
of
the
certification
process,
and
the
fact
that
congress
relied
explicitly
on
the
representations
of
the
executive
branch
spokesman
that
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment
then
pending
before
the
congress
would
remove
all
discretion
from
the
process
and
automatically
impose
the
sanction
that
packwood-magnuson
was
proposing,
an
additional
sanction
to
pelly,
that
is
to
say,
in
this
instance
the
elimination
of
the
privilege
of
fishing
within
the
200-mile
zone.
"
let
me
mention
that
this
was
a
particularly
appropriate
exercise
of
congressional
authority.
it
seems
there
can
be
no
question,
and
indeed
i
doubt...
i
gather
that
the
other
parties
to
the
case
do
not
question
the
authority
of
the
congress
to
enact
a
statute
saying
exactly
what
we
suggest
it
says,
and
that
is
to
say,
a
statute
which
provides
on
the
one
hand
that
foreigners
may
fish
in
the
200-mile
economic
zone
off
the
shores
of
the
united
states,
a
privilege
which
congress
granted
in
1976,
but
at
the
same
time
conditioning
that
congressionally
granted
privilege
upon
compliance
with
the
congressional
standard
that
countries
do
not
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
whaling
convention
system.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
that
is
the
privilege
to
fish...
excuse
me,
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
the
privilege
to
fish
within
the
200-mile
economic
zone.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
no,
no.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
not
under
packwood-magnuson.
i
should
make
clear
there
are
now
two
sanctions,
one
under
pelly
which
is
still
discretionary
on
the
part
of
the
president
to
ban
imports
of
fish
products.
that
was
1971.
the
second,
under
the
1979
packwood-magnuson
amendment
to
the
1976
fisheries
act...
the
1976
fisheries
act
permitted
foreigners
to
fish
within
our
200-mile
economic
zone.
the
1979
packwood-magnuson
amendment
conditioned
that
on
compliance
with
non-diminishment
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention.
that
is
to
say,
what
is
automatically
lost
in
the
event
now
of
a
violation
is
the
right
to
fish
within
the
200-mile
zone.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
yes.
there's
no
question
but
that--
mr.
william
d.
rogers
--this
was,
and
it
is
admitted
by
all
parties
to
have
been
an
intentional
violation.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
of
the
moratorium.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
first
on
sperm
whales,
and
indeed
it
should
be
understood,
mr.
justice,
that
the
sperm
whale
ban
went
into
effect,
we
sued,
and
then
the
agreement
occurred.
this
was
the
precise
sequence
of
events.
but
japan
continued
to
hunt
sperm
whales
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
going
to
get
the
agreement
of
the
executive
branch
even
after
the
ban
sperm
whales
went
into
effect.
now,
there's
not
only
a
ban
on
sperm
whaling
by
the
commission
but
also
a
worldwide
global
moratorium.
they
are
continuing
to
fish
and
have
not
been
sanctioned,
precisely
because
of
the
baldridge-murazumi
amendment.
we
admit
that
an
inadvertent
or
unintentional
violation
would
be
a
different
story,
but
an
intentional
violation
of
this
magnitude
clearly
in
our
judgment
diminishes
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention
system.
let
me
go
back,
if
i
may,
to
a
few
more
points
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
which
as
i
have
indicated
in
our
view
is
crystal-clear.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
reason
i
have
directed
my
attention
to
that
is
that
in
our
judgment,
which
may
be
somewhat
different
from
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
since
we
are
proceeding
under
packwood-magnuson,
it
is
packwood-magnuson
that
we
intend
to
invoke
and
it
is
packwood-magnuson
that
we
think
implies
no
discretion
with
respect
to
sanctions.
we
have
focused
on
that.
the
second
reason
we
have
focused
on
it
is
that
in
our
judgment
if
there's
any
question
about
the
diminished
effectiveness
formula
in
pelly
in
'71,
it
acquired
a
hard,
fixed
meaning
in
the
intervening
eight
years
by,
a,
executive
branch
behavior;
b,
representations
by
the
executive
branch
to
the
congress
in
1979
as
to
what
the
language
meant;
and
c,
congress's
explicit
statement,
we
now
want
to
exclude
all
discretion.
but
to
go
back
to
your
point,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
good
legislative
history
in
our
judgment,
most
particularly
in
the
report
with
respect
to
the
legislation
to
the
senate,
which
indicated
that
diminished
effectiveness
with
respect
to
a
quota
violation
should
be
certified.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
in
the
abstract,
you
are
right,
but
in
the
context
first
of
the
fact
that
this
pelly
amendment
in
connection
with
whaling
was
directed
to
reinforce
congress's
effort
to
strengthen
the
international
whaling
convention
system,
and
the
fact
that
as
congress
saw
it
numerical
quotas
were
the
very
heart
of
that
system.
in
our
judgment,
therefore,
a
violation
of
quotas
as
posed
to
the
other
marginal
violations
that
mr.
burns
mentioned
earlier
on,
violation
of
that
quota
was
understood
at
that
time
to
be
something
which
inescapably
would
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention
system
because
it
was
the
maintenance
of
rigid
ceilings
on
takes,
and
in
congress's
view
hopefully,
eventually
a
total
moratorium
on
any
taking
whatsoever
would
inevitably
constitute
a
diminishment
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention.
to
put
it
the
other
way,
it
is
in
our
judgment
very
hard
to
comprehend
how
the
intentional
violation,
the
wholesale
substantial
violation
of
the
supreme
act
of
the
international
whaling
commission,
that
is
to
say
the
establishment
finally,
after
a
decade
of
pressure
from
the
united
states,
the
establishment
by
the
international
whaling
commission
of
a
firm
worldwide
global
moratorium
on
any
further
taking
of
any
kind
of
whales.
the
flouting
of
such
a
supreme
act
by
the
commission
could
enhance
the
prestige,
maintain
the
dignity,
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
convention
system.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
by
mistake?
mr.
william
d.
rogers
we
would
not
be
here,
and
we
would
not
contend
that
would
diminish
the
effectiveness.
we
would
not
contend
that
the
taking
accidentally
of
a
lactating
whale,
which
is
prohibited
under
the
convention
system,
where
non-intentional
flouting...
if
it
were
not
an
intentional
flouting
would
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
convention.
it's
the
convention
system
that
really
is
the
center
of
the
scheme
and
the
very
reason
why
we're
here.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
yes,
i'll
say
a
word
about
that,
if
i
may,
justice
rehnquist,
as
soon
as
i
finish
up
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
point.
i
would
suggest,
with
all
due
respect,
that
so
palpable
is
it
that
congress
was
intending
to
close
what
it
saw
as
the
loophole
in
the
pelly
amendment
by
enacting
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment,
that
there
can't
be
any
doubt
about
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment
upon
which
we
rely.
the
idea
that
there
is
discretion
with
respect
to
intentional
quota
violations
lurking
in
the
certification
stage
is
advanced
really
in
this
case
for
the
first
time
in
history
of
the
entire
consideration
of
these
statutes,
and
it
would
in
our
judgment
bring
in
by
the
back
door
the
very
discretion
that
congress
intended
to
eliminate
from
the
packwood-magnuson
statutory
scheme
relating
to
the
privilege
of
foreigners
to
fish
in
our
waters.
this
is
a
view,
incidentally,
which
was
embraced
by
the
defendant,
mr.
baldridge,
himself
when
he
communicated
with
the
author
of
the
amendment,
mr.
packwood,
just
a
few
weeks
before
he
made
the
bilateral
arrangement
with
japan
when
he
said,
in
response
to
mr.
packwood's
statement,
"i
see
no
way
around
the
logical
conclusion
that
a
nation
which
ignores
the
moratorium
is
diminishing
the
effectiveness
of
the
iwc.
"
mr.
baldridge
said,
"i
agree".
quote,
"since
any
such
whaling",
that
is
to
say,
in
violation
of
the
quotas,
"any
such
whaling
attributable
to
the
policies
of
a
foreign
government
would
clearly
diminish
the
effectiveness
of
the
iwc.
"
now,
we
don't
contend
that
this
subsequent
exchange
bears
on
the
congressional
intent
in
1979.
you
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
deference
to
executive
branch
officials.
in
our
judgment,
if
any
deference
is
due
to
any
executive
branch
official
it's
due
to
the
views
and
representations
upon
which
congress
relied
of
the
senior
officials
who
testified
to
the
house
in
connection
with
this
packwood-magnuson
amendment
at
the
time
it
was
under
consideration,
mr.
frank
and
augusto
negroponte.
and
in
our
judgment
we
are
persuaded
that
the
court
will
on
its
own
examination
of
the
legislative
history
be
similarly
convinced
that
their
testimony
is
decisive
as
to
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
packwood-magnuson
amendment.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
well,
i
meant
to
say,
and
i
will
mention
again
if
i
may,
justice
o'connor,
in
our
view
the
legislative
history
of
pelly
is
as
good,
although
of
course
no
enlightened
by
the
eight
years
experience
thereafter
with
respect
to
the
legislative
intent
of
the
congress
at
that
time.
i
draw
your
attention,
if
i
may,
to
our
brief
at
page
4
in
which
we
point-out
the
legislative
history
of
the
pelly
amendment,
and
in
addition,
your
honor,
on
page
18
and
19
of...
and
specifically
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
representative
pelly
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
in
our
brief,
in
which
he
explains
that
whales
are
a
notable
example
of
overfished
resources.
and
then,
the
legislative
history
goes
on
to
point
out
through
representative
dingell
that
in
section
8,
explaining
pelly,
"whenever
the
secretary
of
commerce
determines
foreign
nationals
are
conducting
fishing
operations.
"
et
cetera,
"he
must
certify
this
fact
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
"
also,
senator
stevens
who
said,
"section
8
directs
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
certify
to
the
president
the
fact
that
nationals
are
conducting
fishing
operations
in
a
manner
which
diminishes
the
effectiveness
of
the
program.
"
mr.
william
d.
rogers
it's
an
issue
that
we
hadn't
focused
on,
justice
stevens,
because
the
order
as
it
came
out
of
the
district
court
was
an
order
enjoining
the
agreement,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
order
appropriately,
if
it's
expressed
in
affirmative,
mandatory
terms,
would
be
that
he
certifies,
that
he
has
no
discretion
not
to
certify.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
he
hasn't
made
a
determination,
but
our
position
is,
on
that,
that
an
intentional
wholesale
violation
of
a
numerical
quota,
and
most
dramatically
and
particularly
a
wholesale
violation
of
the
supreme
act
of
the
commission,
the
global
moratorium,
is
inevitably,
must
by
any
standard
be
determined
to
be
a
diminishment
of
the
effectiveness.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
"i
have
determined,
and
i
therefore
certify.
"
that's
right.
and
he
should
be
ordered
to
do
both,
in
essence,
in
our
judgment.
with
respect
to
remedies
and
a
variety
of
other
aspects
that
have
been
raised
here,
in
our
judgment
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
determining
that
secretary
baldridge
had
exceeded
his
authority
in
entering
into
the
agreement
that
he
did.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
yes.
our
point
is,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
was
no
discretion
here.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
you
have
not
had
many
cases
either
where
his
authority
is
so
clearly
limited
as
it
was
here.
congress
granted
the
privilege
of
fishing
in
u.s.
waters
but
conditioned
that
privilege
on,
as
we
say
under
the
statute,
an
avoidance
of
a
violation
of
a
numerical
quota
by
the
whaling
commission.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
beg
pardon?
mr.
william
d.
rogers
i
think
the
declaratory
judgment
would
give
us
relief.
i
think
also,
the
injunction
which
was
issued
by
the
court
below
also
would
give
us
the
relief
we
need.
the
relief
issued
by
the
court,
the
district
court,
was
in
fact
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction.
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
here
about
mandamus,
but
although
we
contend
that
we
are
well
within
traditional
concepts
of
mandamus,
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
no
discretion
here,
and
mandamus
is
classically
available
with
respect
to
an
act
as
to
which
the
federal
official
has
no
discretion,
we
also
believe
we
are
fully
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
correct.
he
had
no
authority,
and
he
was
exercising
a
particularly
clearly
delegated
responsibility
from
the
congress.
the
responsibility
that
he
was
exercising
was
the
responsibility
to
administer
the
200-mile
fishing
zone.
one
law
in
1976
told
the
secretary,
issue
licenses
for
foreigners,
issue
allocations
to
foreigners.
the
other
law
in
1979,
packwood-magnuson,
told
him,
take
those
allocations
back
if
anybody
violates
a
numerical
quota
from
the
whaling
convention.
congress
had
the
authority
to
give
that
power,
to
give
that
responsibility.
it
had
the
authority
to
take
it
away.
this
is
not,
if
you
will,
the
usual
foreign
policy
case.
it's
not
like
dames
and
moore,
for
example,
or
regan
versus
wald,
or
the
typical
case
in
which
plaintiffs
are
here
asking
you
to
overrule
a
cooperative
act
between
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
with
respect
to
foreign
policy,
as
certainly
was
the
case
in
both
of
those
two
instances.
mr.
william
d.
rogers
no.
i
certainly
wouldn't,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
also
would
not
say
that
merely
because
a
case
happens
to
affect
foreign
policy,
or
political
questions
in
general,
this
court
should
stay
its
hand.
this
court's
responsibility,
as
justice
marshall
has
told
all
of
us
so
often,
is
emphatically
to
declare
what
the
law
is.
we
are
only
here
asking
you
to
declare
what
the
law
is.
the
mere
fact
that
your
declaration
will
have
international
consequences,
the
mere
fact
that
your
declaration
in
other
cases
will
have
political
consequences,
is
no
reason
to
avoid
what
is
the
very
essence
of
this
court's
responsibility.
if
it
is,
it's
a
new
canon
of
statutory
interpretation.
thank
you.
