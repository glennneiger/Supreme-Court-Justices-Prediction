justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cogan,
if
that
were
dispositive
of
the
case,
why
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
write
all
the
rest
of
the
opinion
it
did
on
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
have
any
rule
that
it
prefers
to
avoid
constitutional
decisions
if
a
decision
could
be
placed
on
a
statutory
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
we
held
in
hensley
that
that
was
the
only
way
it
could
be
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
sentence
could
be
confusing.
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
court
has
held
it
may
be
done
in
this
way,
and
has
never
held
it
may
be
done
in
any
other
way,
and
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
the
court
has
held
that
it
may
be
done
in
this
way
and
only
this
way.
i
take
it,
it
was
the
former
that
you
meant
to
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
there
ever
been
a
holding
that
it
is
insufficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
then
that
the
availability
of
a
vehicle
identification
number
to
an
officer
depends
on
him
having
either
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
or
something
along
those
lines?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
congress
intended
to
make
vin's
regularly
available
to
law
enforcement
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
couldn't
be
done
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
over
the
vin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
should
the
driver
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
fact
that
he
obscures
the
vin
from
a
view
that
would
not
have
amounted
to
a
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
question
that
an
officer
has
the
authority--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
prevent
him
from
driving?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
plain
view
from
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
could
see
it
just
standing
up
outside
the
car,
looking
in
the
plane
of
vision
that
you
would
be
looking
through
a
window?
