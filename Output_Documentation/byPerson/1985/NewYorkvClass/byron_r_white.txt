when
did
they
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
he
just
know
that
he
didn't
have
his
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
police
then
would
have
had
to
get
in
the
car
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
two
policemen,
weren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
them
got
in
the
car
without
knowing
anything
except
that
this
fellow
had
been
speeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
change
my
language,
entered
the
car,
when
he
entered
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
it
had
been
the
practice
of
the
manufacturer
to
put
the
vin
number
under
the
back
seat...
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument,
that
they
just
didn't
have
any
interest
in
the
privacy
of
the
vin
number,
even
if
you
had
to
get
into
the
car
and
take
out
the
back
seat?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
should
just
say
that
you
can
always
search
a
car
any
time
you
stop
somebody
who
is
subject
to
an
official
arrest;
as
long
as
there's
probable
cause.
you
don't
have
to
arrest
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
it
contained
some--
justice
byron
r.
white
--some
contraband,
or
evidence
of
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
he
could
not
have
seen
it
from
outside
the
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
says
he
could,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
they
hadn't
found
the
gun;
all
they
found
was
the
number
which
had
been
obscured
and
you
couldn't
see
it
from
outside,
and
suppose
in
a
criminal
prosecution
later
it
became,
that
number
became
relevant.
would
that
number
have
been
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
not
relevant.
would
it
have
been
admissible?
assume
it
had
been
relevant
to
some
element
of
the
crime
that
was
charged.
now,
he
couldn't
get
that
vin
number
without
getting
inside
the
car.
would
you
say
that
that
would
be
also
excludable?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
law
require...
does
the
law
require
the
driver
to
reveal
the
vin
to
an
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
what
if
the
officer
says,
i
want
to
get
in
your
car
to
look
at
the
vin
number.
must
the
driver
let
him
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
i
asked
you
a
while
ago,
and
i
thought
you
said
there
was
no
such
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
motorist
is
obligated
the
give
the
officer
the
vin
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
allow...
the
new
york
courts
have
ruled
that
the
law
does
not
permit
the
officer
to
enter
the
car,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
driver
refuses?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
clear
that
if
he
refuses,
he's
committed
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
couldn't
arrest
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
arrests.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
plenty
to
believe
that
he
had
never
been
allowed
to
get
back
in
his
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
have
let
him
drive
away
without
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
about
that.
they
may
not
have
arrested
him.
what
if
they
said,
"why
don't
you
just
go
ahead
and
walk
home,
we'll
take
car
of
your
car?
"
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
they
could
enter
the
car,
though,
and
turn
the
lights
off
and
make
sure
the
ignition
was
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
they
just
said,
"you
can't
get
back
in
your
car,
you
don't
have
a
license.
"
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
means
that
he
couldn't
drive
away
in
his
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
under
new
york
law,
unlicensed
drivers
may
drive?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
just
issue
him
a
citation
for
driving
without
a
license,
and
they
say,
look,
you
can't
drive.
we're
not
arresting
you,
we're
not
going
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
but
we're
certainly
going
to
drive
your
car
away
and
you
can
pick
it
up
when
some
member
of
your
family...
we
can't
leave
this
car
on
the
highway
so
we're
going
to
drive
it
down
to
the
police
station,
you
can
come
and
pick
it
up
when
you
want
to,
have
your
mother
do
it,
have
your
father...
now,
they
certainly
would
be
authorized
to
do
that
under
the
new
york
law,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
before
an
inventory,
i
suppose
if
the
officers
started
to
get
in
the
car
to
drive
it
away,
which
you
say
he
was
authorized
to
do,
and
he
happened
to
glance
down
and
see
the
gun,
he
could
seize
the
gun?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
talking
about
this
case,
not
ten
million
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
see
it
right
through
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
that's
only
if
the
driver
removed
the
piece
of
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
if
the
driver
had
said,
"no,
i'm
not
removing
any
paper
at
all.
"
you
say
the
officer
could
not
have
stuck
his
head
in
the
car
and
removed
the
paper
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
can
go
in
to
see
the
vin
number,
why,
he
could
notice
a
gun
in
plain
sight,
couldn't
he?
how
do
you
get
him
into
the
car
to
see
the
vin
number
without
arguing
one
of
your
other
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
time
you
make
a
traffic
stop
you
should
be
able
to
check
the
vin
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
entails
entering
a
car?
