justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
have...
what
about
the
statutory
question?
they
also
said,
as
i
read
the
last
paragraph,
that
section
4
of
the
vehicle
and
traffic
law
did
not
authorize
the
officer
to
do
what
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
pursue
the
statutory
question
one
more
moment.
you
said
it
didn't
authorize
them
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
say
it
authorized
it
if
they
had
already
held
that
it
was
constitutionally
impermissible
for
the
officer
to
do
that?
the
statute
couldn't
authorize
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case
did
he
make
any
use
of
the
vin,
the
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
he
do
in
this
case?
did
he
actually
write
it
down
or
phone
it
in
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suppose
your
reasons
for
wanting
to
know
the
vin
number
to
determine
whether
maybe
it
was
a
stolen
vehicle
or
something
might
have
been
increased
rather
than
decreased
when
you
suspected
him
of
other
wrongful
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
why
do
you
look
at
the
vin
number?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cogan,
does
new
york
have
a
rule
that
if
there's
no
violation
of
the
constitution
but
merely
an
action
in
excess
of
statutory
authority,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
will
apply?
is
there
any
such
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you've
got
violations
of
both,
is
what
you're
saying?
we
don't
know
for
sure
whether
they
would
have
excluded
if
there
had
only
been
a
statutory
violation,
and
that's
why
perhaps
they
had
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
in
order
to
include
the
other
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
court
didn't
tell
us
what
the
officer
does
if
the
driver
says,
"i'm
sorry,
i
won't
tell
you.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
statute
that
says
you've
got
to
give
your
accurate
identification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cogan,
if
you're
summarizing,
when
and
exactly
at
what
point
do
you
say
the
unlawful
conduct
occurred,
when
he
opened
the
door
or
when
he
stuck
his
head
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
would
have
been
unlawful
even
if
the
vin
had
been
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
cogan,
when
was
the
last
time
to
your
knowledge
that
this
court
ever
sustained
a
search
of
a
car,
ever
upheld
a
search
of
a
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
have
been
a
lot
of
car
search
cases
in
the
last
few
years,
haven't
there?
