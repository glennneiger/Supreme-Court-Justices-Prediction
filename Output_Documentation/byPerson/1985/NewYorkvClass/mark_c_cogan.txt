mr.
mark
c.
cogan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
commence
my
argument
by
responding
to
as
question
that
was
posed
both
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens
before
the
lunch
break,
and
in
doing
so
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
it
is
our
contention
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
decided
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
both
in
the
new
york
state
constitution,
article
1,
section
12
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
in
this
case,
in
which
that
court
is
used
in
a
whole
host
of
cases
to
declare
a
substantial
independent
right
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
under
new
york's
constitution,
and
also
under
section
401
of
the
vehicle
and
traffic
law.
in
its
opinion
rendered
below,
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
the
new
york
vehicle
and
traffic
law,
section
401,
to
determine
whether
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
traffic
violation,
whether
an
officer
has
a
right
to
search
the
car
for
the
vehicle
identification
number.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
401
gives
the
officer
absolutely
no
authorization
to
conduct
a
search.
the
correct
procedure
for
an
officer
to
follow
when
he
wants
vin
information,
other
information
to
identify
the
car,
is
for
the
officer
to
make
a
demand.
the
officer
has
a
right
under
section
401
to
demand
the
vin
from
the
motorist.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
both
the
constitutional
issues,
state
and
federal,
and
the
statutory
issue,
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
court
not
only
addressed
constitutional
but
also
statutory
grounds
for
this
search
is
not
dispositive
of
the
question,
whether
there
were
in
fact
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i
don't
know
of
any
such
policy
that
has
been
enunciated
in
its
cases,
but
quite
often
state
courts
will
address
both
statutory
and
constitutional
issues
in
a
single
opinion.
what
the
court
first
addressed,
it
first
addressed
itself
to
the
question
whether
this
was
a
search
that
violated--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--the
case
that
would
come
to
my
mind
would
be
people
against
marsh,
decided
more
than
ten
years
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
the
case
where
the
court
first
enunciated
the
fact
that
in
new
york
there
is
no
authorization
for
a
search
upon
an
ordinary
traffic
stop.
and,
in
people
against
marsh,
the
court
addressed
itself
to
the
question
whether
a
search
was
authorized
by
the
statute
and
it
also
considered
whether
the
search
was
authorized
under
the
constitution.
it
found
the
answer
to
both
those
questions
was
no,
and
so
our
answer
would
be
that
the
search
in
violation
of
statutory
or
constitutional
dictates
mandates
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
was
that
this
was
an
unlawful
search,
and
it
decided
that
on
three
different
grounds,
each
of
which
is
an
independent
ground
for
decision,
and
in
so
holding
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
choice
other
than
to
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
we
would
maintain
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that,
in
effect,
in
its
opinion.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
court
may
not
have
used
those
precise
words.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
throughout
the
entire
litigation
of
this
case
in
the
state
courts,
the
defendant
maintained
that
this
search
violated
his
rights
under
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
we
urged
both
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
answer,
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
is
that
we
maintain
that
the
search
violated
both
state
and
federal
law.
we
saw
no
need
to
limit
ourselves--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--to...
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
substantive
issues
addressed
in
this
appeal,
should
this
court
reach
the
fourth
amendment
issue
framed
by
the
petitioner,
we
maintain
that
the
court
should
hold
that
officer
mcnamee
conducted
an
unreasonable
search
when
he
entered
mr.
class's
car
in
order
to
see
the
vehicle
identification
number,
where
officer
mcnamee
had
absolutely
no
factual
grounds
to
believe
that
the
car
was
stolen.
officer
mcnamee
never
stated
the
reason
why
he
wanted
to
see
the
vin.
he
never
suggested
that
he
had
any
belief
that
the
vehicle
was
stolen,
and
indeed
under
the
facts
of
the
case
there
could
have
been
no
such
reasonable
belief.
the
only
thing
that
officer
mcnamee
knew
when
he
plunged
into
mr.
class's
car
was
that
this
person
had
been
stopped
for
driving
five
to
ten
miles
per
hour
above
the
speed
limit
and
that
he
had
a
cracked
windshield.
without
even
waiting
to
hear
what
mr.
class
disclosed
to
his
partner,
officer
meyer,
in
the
way
of
registration,
the
insurance
documents
for
the
car
which
mr.
class
produced
and
were
in
order,
officer
mcnamee
proceeded
straight
to
the
car
and
went
inside.
officer
mcnamee
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
communication
from
his
partner,
and
since
there
was
no
communication
between
the
officers
at
the
scene
of
the
stop,
petitioner's
argument
that
the
collective
knowledge
of
the
officers
is
plainly
without
any
merit.
this
court
has
held
that
one
officer's
knowledge
can
be
imputed
to
another
officer
only
where
there
has
been
some
kind
of
communication
between
the
officers,
or
a
directive,
for
instance
from
one
police
department
to
another
police
department,
as
the
court
decided
in
hensley.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
only
way
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
it
in
this
court's
decisions,
that
information
can
be
imputed
is
where
there
has
been
communication.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
holding
that
mere
collective
knowledge
is
sufficient
to
give
an
officer
authorization.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
exactly.
the
intrusion
into
mr.
class's
car
plainly
constituted
search
under
this
court's
decisions.
why
did
it
constitute
a
search?
because
intruding
into
mr.
class's
car,
officer
mcnamee
made
the
physical
entry
and
by
doing
so
he
was
able
to
expose
areas
of
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle
which
would
not
have
been
visible
to
him
without
making
that
intrusion.
that
is
the
basic
definition
of
a
search.
there
can
be
no
other
interpretation
as
to
that
matter.
having
conducted
a
search,
and
we're
not
necessarily
contending
this
was
a
full-blown
search
of
the
car
necessitating
probable
cause,
we're
not
maintaining
that
the
officer
needed
to
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
make
his
intrusion.
all
we
would
state--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--to
enter
the
car,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
was
stolen.
officer
mcnamee--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--some
contraband.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
we're
not
maintaining
that
probable
cause
is
the
standard.
all
we
are
stating
is
that
when
an
officer
makes
such
an
intrusion
into
a
car,
exposes
areas
not
otherwise
visible
to
the
outsider,
that
constitutes
a
search
and
he
may
not
do
so
unless
he
has
some
factual
basis
for
believing
that
there
would
be
some
contraband
or
some
stolen
car.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
he
opened
the
door
because
he
thought
the
vin
was
on
the
door
panel.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
he
leaned
inside,
reached
for
the
papers.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
he
leaned
into
the
car.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it
seems
that
he
put
his
head
in
the
car,
and
shoulders,
perhaps.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
that's
right.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
right.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
once
he
saw
the
gun,
and
mr.
class
was
certainly--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--certainly,
and
if
he
had
seen
the
gun
as
in
texas
against
brown,
if
he
had
seen
the
gun
without
entering
the
car
he
could
have
seized
it.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
under
the
plain
view
doctrine--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--in
texas--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--well,
the
record
shows,
in
our
opinion,
your
honor,
that
mr....
that
officer
mcnamee
opened
the
door,
leaned
into
the
car,
whatever
part
of
his
body
that
was
in
the
car,
the
top
part
of
his
body
if
you
will,
was
inside
the
vehicle
because
when
he
saw
the
weapon
he
saw
it
by
looking
down.
his
head
must
have
been
inside
the
car.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
for
the
proposition
that
this
weapon
could
have
been
seen
from
outside
the
car.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
petitioners
never--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--would
it
have
been
relevant,
had
the--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--as
long
as
the
officer
had
no
right
to
enter
the
vehicle,
the
fruits
of
that
search,
the
evidence
that
he
obtained
as
a
result
of
that
intrusion,
must
be
suppressed.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
well,
we
would
say
that
in
order
for
an
officer
to
make
a
physical
entry
into
a
vehicle,
he
has
to
have
some
factual
grounds
sufficient
to
suggest
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
car
is
stolen.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
in
its
regulations,
in
the
federal
regulations
where
manufacturers
are
required
to
place
the
vin
on
a
certain
part
of
a
vehicle,
the
reason
why
we
have
the
regulations
structured
in
that
way
is
because
it's
assumed
that
in
many
cases
in
vin
could
be
seen
without
making
a
physical
intrusion.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
looking
through
the
windshield
without
entering
the
vehicle
at
all,
and
that's
often
what
will
happen.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
no,
certainly.
we
do
not
maintain
that
an
officer
can't
see
what's
in
plain
view.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
in
this
case
it
so
happened,
and
i'm
sure
that
if
your
honors
will
notice
cars
you
see
parked
on
the
street,
you
will
see
that
in
many
cases
vehicles
have
all
kinds
of
scraps
of
paper
in
the
base...
we're
talking
about
in
the
base
of--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--well,
this
would
be
my
answer,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
to
suggest
that
this
vin
was
covered
up
intentionally.
it
was
at
most
inadvertent.
the
petitioner
tries
to
make
what
he
can
as
to
whether
it
was
intentional
or
negligent.
but,
in
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
this
was
anymore
than--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--there
is
no
regulation
that
prohibits
a
motorist
from
allowing
a
scrap
of
paper
to
settle
on
top
of--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--this
is
addressed
by
new
york
state
law.
the
legislature
has
determined
that--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--i
don't
know
of
any
such
statute,
but
under
new
york
law,
which
we
think
is
very
relevant
to
this
case
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
addressed--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--once
mr.
class
was
stopped
for
his
five
to
ten
miles
an
hour
speeding
violation,
he
walked...
he
proceeded,
he
exited
his
car,
walked
up
to
officer
meyer,
showed
him...
said,
"what
can
i
do
for
you,
officer.
"
showed
him
his
registration,
insurance
papers.
he
had
closed
the
door
after
he
exited
the
vehicle.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
empty
of
what?
there
were
no
other
passengers.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
no,
no
other
occupants.
mr.
class
was--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--that's
right,
and
that's
what,
we
maintain,
is
exactly--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--is
exactly
what
was
wrong
in
this
case.
officer
mcnamee--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--right.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it's
attached
to
the
vehicle.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
correct,
it's
on
a--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--no,
clearly
you
can't.
the
statute
that
the
new
york
legislature
has
adopted,
as
interpreted
by
the
highest
authority
on
new
york
law,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
provides
that
an
officer
is
to
demand
the
information
of
the
motorist.
he
has
no
right
to
undertake
a
search
for
this
information.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
this
is
speculation,
of
course,
but
what
might
have
happened
had
officer
mcnamee
asked,
as
he
properly
should
have
done,
for
the
vehicle
identification
number
information,
he...
certainly,
had
mr.
class
refused
him
access
to
that
information
mr.
class
would
have
committed
a
further
violation
of
the
traffic
law
and
could
have
received
a
summons.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
there's
a
statute
that
requires
mr.
class...
the
statute
we're
talking
about
is
section
401,
requires
the
motorist
to
give
to
the
officer
the
registration
and
other
documentation
including
the
vin
number.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
that
is
right,
new
york
law,
section
401.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
that's
right.
self-help
is
not
an
option.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it's
not
clear
whether
the
officer
would
have
a--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--he
has
not
committed
a
crime.
he's
committed
a
violation
of
the
vehicle
and
traffic
law,
which
is
new
york
is
not
classified
a
crime.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
there
is
authorization
for
an
arrest
in
a
case
of
a
traffic
violation,
and
this
may
go
back
to
justice
brennan's
question
earlier.
there
is
authorization
under
new
york
statutes
for
an
arrest
for
the
most
minor
vehicle
traffic
violation.
but,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
repeatedly,
an
arrest
is
not
the
appropriate
procedure
for
an
officer
to
follow.
it
is
far...
it
is
anything
but
inevitable
for
an
officer
to
place
a
motorist
under
arrest
for
an
ordinary
traffic--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--merely
upon
the
existence
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
a
traffic
violation,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
mere
probable
cause
to
arrest
is
not
a
sufficient
ground
for
making
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
we
have
cases
going
back
many
years,
that
this
court
has
decided,
which
hold
that
the
search
incident
to
arrest
power
exists
only
where
there
has
been
a
custodial
arrest,
not
a
mere--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--when--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--under
new
york
against
belton,
of
course,
the
officer
has
the
power
to
conduct
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
if
he
arrests.
that
is
the
big
mr.
class
would
have
been
arrested
for
his
traffic
violation.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it
is
not
mandated
that
an
officer
place
him
under
arrest
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
car
might
have
been
secured
right
there
and
they
would
have
awaited
some
family
member
to
drive
it
away.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
even
if
they
had
not
made
an
arrest?
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
mere
fact
that
he
didn't
have
a
license--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--well,
we
would
maintain
that's
not
necessarily
the
case,
in
new
york
at
least.
i
don't
know
what
the
procedures
are--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--there's
nothing
saying
that
the
officer's
required
to
take
him
off
the
road,
as
he
would
in
a
case
where
there's
an
intoxicated
driver
who's
a
positive
menace
to
the
others
on
the
highway.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
absolutely.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
mere
authority
to
place
somebody
on
arrest
has
never
been
recognized
as
giving
the
power
to
conduct
a
search.
the
arrest...
the
power
to
conduct
a
search
incident
to
arrest
enters
into
the
picture
only
after
there
has
been
an
arrest.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
they
were
authorized
to
do
that.
they
had
not
taken
custody
of
his
car
at
the
time
of
that
search.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
certainly,
under
opperman.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
if
this
were
an
opperman
case
where
there
had
been
a--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--had
they
taken
his
car
into
custody,
it
seems
that
they
would
have
had
the
power
to
conduct
an
inventory
search.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it's
possible.
there
are
any
number
of
scenarios
that
might
have
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
and
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
without
any
information
as
to
mr.
glass's
licensed
or
unlicensed
status,
officer
mcnamee
went
directly
into
the
vehicle
and
at
that
point
he--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--could
he
have
seen
it...
well,
had
mr.
class
been
seated
in
the
car,
let's
say,
had
the
officer
prudently
told
him
to
keep
his
hands
in
view,
which
is
a
recommended
procedure,
"please
remove
the
piece
of
paper
that's
covering
up
the
vin.
"
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
under
new
york
law,
he
could
have
seen
the
vin
without
making
any
intrusion
into
the
vehicle.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
put
his
head
in
the
car
to
see
the
vin.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
vehicle
identification
number
is
commonly
found
on
a
plate
that
is
affixed
to
the
lower
base
of
the
dashboard.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
certainly,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
right
through
the
windshield.
a
vin
is
something
that--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--that's
right.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
under
new
york
law,
it's
not
clear
what
the
officer's
remedy
be
had
mr.
class
refused
to
remove
the
piece
of
paper.
we
maintain
that
the
mere
refusal
to
remove
the
paper,
the
mere
refusal
to
give
the
vin
information,
does
not
give
any
reasonable
suggestion
that
the
car
is
stolen.
there
are
many
other
things
these
officers
could
have
done,
had
they
had
a
suspicion
that
that
car
was
stolen.
there
is
no
need
in
this
case
for
the
police
to
intrude
into
mr.
class's
vehicle.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
under
that
scenario,
it's
possible
he
could
have
seen
the
gun.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
it's
possible
that
could
have
been
done
too.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
the
mr.
class,
the
arrest,
the
inventory
of
the
car,
all
of
these
things
are
very
much
speculation
in
this
case.
there
is
no
reason...
there
was
not
testimony
in
this
case
that
the
officers
inevitably
would
have
done,
x,
y
or
z.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i'm
not
sure
how
it
got
off
the
street.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
when
mr.
class
was
arrested
for
possession
of
the
weapon
the
police
took
custody
of
the
car.
but
we
certainly
can't
look
to
the...
in
retrospective
hindsight
to
look
to
the
fact
that
he
was
arrested
and
therefore
justify
the
original
entry
that
was
the
cause
of
the
discovery
of
that
evidence.
in
summary,
your
honors,
we
maintain
that
this
case--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--the
unlawful
conduct
in
this
case
occurred
when
officer
mcnamee
opened
the
door
of
the
car.
at
that
point--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--that
is
right.
that
is
our
position.
but
of
course,
in
this
case
officer
mcnamee
went
further
than
that
and
leaned
into
the
vehicle,
disturbed
papers
on
the
dashboard.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honors,
is
in
rebuttal
to
the
petitioner's
contention
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
vehicle.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
a
person
does
not
have
the
same
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
car
that
he
has
in
his
home.
certainly,
we're
not
contending
that
he
has
the
same
expectation
of
privacy
there,
nor
has
this
court
ever
held
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy
at
all
in
a
vehicle.
people
keep
all
kinds
of
very
private
things
in
their
cars,
even
things,
say,
in
a
two-car
family
a
husband
might
have
a
car
and
keep
things
in
it
that
he
wouldn't
be
comfortable
having
his
wife
see.
there
might
be
things
pertaining
to
a
medical
condition--
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
--when
is
the
last
time?
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
i
can't
honestly
say,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
mark
c.
cogan
and
we
maintain
that
under
no
decision
of
this
court
has
the
action
of
officer
mcnamee
ever
been
justified.
lacking
any
articulable
grounds
for
entering
the
car,
we
maintain
that
officer
mcnamee
conducted
an
unreasonable
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
should
the
court
reach
the
fourth
amendment
question,
we
would
maintain
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
also,
of
course,
we
maintain
that
this
case
is
not
even
reviewable
by
this
body,
by
this
court,
because
the
decision
rests
on
adequate
and
independent
state
and
constitutional
grounds,
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
thank
you
very
much.
