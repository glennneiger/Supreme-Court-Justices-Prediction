mr.
kartagener,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
resume
argument,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
that
when
they
got
him
down
to
the
police
station
on
the
possession
of
the
gun
charge,
that
somebody
would
check
out
to
see
whether
he
was
driving
a
stolen
car
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
might
be
some
connection
between
this
man's
cooperative
conduct
in
getting
out
of
his
car
and
going
to
the
policeman,
and
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
had
a
pistol
under
the
seat?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
something
for
the
fact
finders,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
got
him
down
to
the
station,
the
man
in
the
car,
wouldn't
they
make
a
routine
inventory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
contents
of
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cogan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
was
the
driver
when
the
policeman
put
his
head
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
get
to
my
question.
was
the
car
empty
when
the
policeman
put
his
head
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
passengers,
yes,
that's
what--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--if
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
car,
it
would
have
been
perhaps
more
normal,
the
officer
might
have
simply
said,
"give
me"
whatever
it
was
he
was
looking
for
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
occasion
for
him
to
put
his
head
inside.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
an
empty
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
didn't
enter
the
vehicle.
he
put
his
head
into
the
vehicle.
i'm
trying
to
get
these
facts
a
little
clearer
and
not
slide
over
them.
so,
when
he
approached
the
car,
if
the
driver
had
been
sitting
in
it,
he
surely
would
have
had
a
right
to
say,
"where
is
your
vin?
"
"where
is
it
so
i
can
see
it?
"
could
he
see
it
without
putting
his
head
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
not
put
his
head
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
was
it
located?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
he
could
see
that
without
putting
his
head
in
the
window?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
conceded
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
think,
in
response
to
a
some
question,
that
they
could
have
made
him
take
a
bus
home
or
walk
home,
and
taken
the
car
down
to
the
station.
now,
as
justice
white
suggested,
one
of
his
questions
suggested,
when
the
officer
got
in
the
car,
right
at
that
point
isn't
it
likely
that
he
would
have
seen
the
gun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
didn't
see
it
there.
you
have
conceded
too
that
when
it
got
down
to
the
police
station
they
could
have
made
an
inventory
search
and
perhaps
they
are
required
to
make
an
inventory
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what's
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
the
car
get
off
the
street?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
officers
let
an
unlicensed
driver
drive
the
car
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
