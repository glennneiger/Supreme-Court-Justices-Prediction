mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court
today
is
being
asked
to
decide
whether
a
new
york
city
police
officer's
efforts
to
conduct
a
routine
inspection
of
an
automobile's
vehicle
identification
number,
the
vin,
located
on
a
dashboard
of
a
car
and
ordinarily
viewable
through
the
windshield,
attending
a
lawful
traffic
stop
for
two
observed
traffic
infractions
that
were
observed
by
the
police
officer,
constitutes
a
search
as
that
term
is
defined
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
we,
of
course,
argue
preliminarily
in
our
brief
that
no
search
occurred
here
because
the
police
officer's
actions
did
not
infringe
on
any
reasonable,
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy
in
this
case.
now,
of
course,
it's
been
said
frequently
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
argument,
and
we
recognize
that,
of
course.
and
what
makes
this
case
a
little
bit
special,
and
we'd
like
the
court
to
recognize
that,
is
that
regardless
of
how
this
court
determines
this
question
of
search/non-search,
unlike
some
other
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
recently
in
which
that
determination
was
the
final
outcome
determinative
here,
regardless
of
how
the
court
determines
the
preliminary
question,
we
suggest
that
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
court
should
be
the
same...
that
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
here...
because
we
do
believe
that
even
if
this
was
a
search
here,
the
police
officer's
actions
in
this
case
of
opening
up
a
car
door
and
reaching
within
his
hand
to
move
aside
a
paper
that
covered
the
vehicle
identification
number
was
so
manifestly
reasonable,
so
minimally
intrusive
under
the
circumstances,
that
the
proper
balance
between
the
individual's
rights
and
the
compelling
interest
of
society
was
struck
and
that
no
fourth
amendment
sin
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
your
honor,
the
decision
of
the
court
below
cited
the
new
york
state
constitution
once
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
opinion,
finding
that
the
actions
of
the
police
officer
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
new
york
state
constitution,
which
by
the
way
is
worded
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
as
the
fourth
amendment.
only
once
does
it
mention
the
new
york
state
constitution,
but
we
think
it's
rather
clear
under
this
court's
determination
in
michigan
v.
long,
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case
because
after
mentioning
the
new
york
state
constitution,
it
left
it
behind
and
went
on
to
analyze
the
case
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
was
cited
a
number
of
times
within
the
opinion,
and
because
of
the
reliance
that
was
placed
on
a
number
of
the
constitutional
cases
emanating
from
this
court,
cases
such
as
united
states
v.
chadwick,
united
states
v.
chase,
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
and
we
think
that
here
they
only
cited
the
new
york
state
constitution
once
in
michigan
v.
long...
it
was
twice,
and
in
california
v.
carney
as
well
there
was
a
citing
to
the
state's
constitution.
but,
we
think
it
clear
here
that
there
was
not
the
required
plain
statement
that
the
decision
in
this
case
rested
on
an
adequate
and
truly
independent
state
ground.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
gone
to
the--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
new
york
law
would
not
require
the
exclusion
of
evidence,
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
there.
the
court
saw
no
need,
as
it
has
in
so
many
other
cases,
as
i
might
point
out,
justice
o'connor,
that
court,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
is
not
shy
about
making
its
opinion
known
when
it
feels
that
new
york
law
alone
might
require
the
exclusion
of
evidence
although
the
fourth
amendment
does
not.
i
would
suggest
that
since
this
case
came
down
after
michigan
v.
long,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
on
ample
notice
as
to
how
to
make
that
plain
statement
and
chose
not
to
do
so.
it
said
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
new
york
state
constitution,
and
basically
left--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--well,
that
is
done,
your
honor,
because
that
was
refuting
an
argument
that
we
made
in
our
brief.
they
did
not
say
that
that
statute,
vehicle
and
traffic
law
section
401,
prohibited
the
search.
they
merely
said
that
the
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
401
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
vehicle
identification
numbers
themselves,
did
not
give
the
police
the
authority
that
we
suggest
that
it
might
have,
and
we
think
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
statute
doesn't
give
you
the
right
to
do
it,
and
entirely
another
thing
to
say
the
fourth
amendment
proscribes
it.
the
court
did
not
say
that
vtl
section
401
prescribed
the
search,
justice
stevens.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
yes.
the
new
york's
constitution--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--well,
i
think
that
because
it
is
precisely
the
same
wording,
it's
logical
that
they
might
frequently
cite
the
new
york
counterpart
to
the
search
and
seizure
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution,
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
decision
rested
largely
on
federal
grounds.
at
the
least,
they
were
integrally
interwoven.
if
i
might
suggest
to
the
court--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--yes.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
no.
what
we
were
suggesting,
your
honor,
was
that
under
new
york
law,
because
there
is
an
obligation
to
surrender
one's
certificate
of
registration,
and
that's
what
vtl
401
is
all
about,
that
the
giving
over
of
the
certificate
of
registration
is
meaningless
if
you
can't
compare
the
registration
against
the
vehicle
identification
number.
so
we
tried
to
draw
an
analog.
because
the
driver
was
required
to
hand
over
the
certificate
of
registration,
there
had
to
be
an
absolute
right
under
the
statute
to
check
the
vehicle
identification
number
out.
but
what
i
think
is
critical
once
again
is
that
that
was
an
argument
that
we
made
as
a
justification
for
saying
it
fit
in
with
the
general
scheme.
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
but
what
they
did
say
was,
assuming
that
statute
doesn't
exist,
what
you
really
have
here
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and,
as
i
read
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
v.
long,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
it's
precisely
the
type
of
discussion
that
we're
having
right
now,
about
whether
new
york
law
might
require
or
wouldn't
require,
which
has
been
eschewed
by
the
court's
determination
in
michigan
v.
long
that
we
shouldn't
be
getting
into
that
type
of
a
debate.
if
the
face
of
the
opinion
does
not
contain
a
plain
statement
from
the
state
court
saving,
we
are
deciding
this
essentially
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground...
perhaps
here
the
new
york
state
constitution
or
statute,
it's
not
goin'
to
do
that,
that
opinion,
and
instead
cites
the
fourth
amendment
repeatedly,
and
cases
from
this
court
repeatedly.
we
think
it's
rather
clear
that
the
court,
consistent
with
michigan
v.
long
and
california
v.
carney
has
the
jurisdiction
to
consider
and
to
decide
this
case.
this
would
not
be
an
extension
of
that
principle.
if
anything,
it's
a
diminution
of
sorts
because
in
michigan
v.
long,
as
i
pointed
out,
it
had
two
citations
to
the
state
constitution.
here
we've
got
only
one.
i've
suggested
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
bases,
or
two
sides
of
the
line
here,
search
or
non-search,
and
we
suggest
that
we
should
prevail
under
either.
but,
we
do
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
the
sounder
conclusion
is
that
no
search
did
occur
here.
why
do
i
say
that?
because
we
know
that
the
term
"search"
has
a
very
special
meaning
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
there
is
no
search
unless
the
government
intrudes
upon
a
reasonable,
justifiable
or
legitimate,
if
you
will,
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
individual
has,
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
clearly,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
respondent
could
have
had
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
why?
to
begin
with,
we're
dealing
with
an
automobile,
not
the
individual's
person,
not
his
home,
not
his
office,
an
automobile
which
this
court
has
recognized
involves
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
first
instance.
and
why
is
there
that
reduced
expectation
of
privacy?
some
of
the
early
decisions
of
this
court
noted
the
relatively
open
configuration
of
the
court...
of
the
car,
excuse
me.
but
in
california
v.
carney
the
court
says,
but
there's
another
very
special
thing.
cars
are
pervasively
regulated.
well,
here
you
have
pervasive
government
regulation
of
a
car.
you
have
a
car
being
stopped
because
of
traffic
infractions.
everybody
knows
you
have
to
hand
over
your
registration,
your
license,
and
today
frequently
the
insurance
card,
and
yet...
and
presumably
to
give
meaning
to
that
governmental
regulation.
yet,
what
happens
if
you
can't
look
at
the
vin?
it
means
that
the
whole
concept
of
regulating
automobiles
becomes
nugatory.
because
the
vin,
the
vehicle
identification
number,
is
the
heart
of,
the
sine
qua
non
of
that
entire
pervasive
regulatory
scheme.
because
my
registration
and
anyone
else's
usually
has
the
car's
vehicle
identification
number.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
the
officer
tried
to
look
at
it,
justice
stevens.
he
wanted
to
check
it
out.
it
is,
we
suggest,
a
very
routine
procedure
for
police
officers
to
do
that.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
what
happened,
justice
stevens,
was
that
as
the
car
was
stopped
and
pulled
over
for
the
two
traffic
infractions,
the
driver
got
out
of
the
car
and
proceeded
back
to
the
police
car
to
speak
to
one
of
the
officers
who
was
standing
there,
officer
meyer.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
justice
blackmun,
i'll
be
quite
frank
about
that.
the
best
police
practice,
i
do
believe,
and
i've
read
some
of
the
police
training
manuals,
is
to
keep
the
individual
in
the
car
on
some
occasions,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
however,
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
it
was
condoned
to
bring
an
individual
out
of
the
car
if
there
is
a
concern
for
the
police
officer's
safety.
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
or
anything.
sometimes
he'll
bring
the
individual
out
of
the
car.
generally
speaking,
i
do
believe,
police
officers
maintain
greater
control
by
keeping
the
individuals
in
the
car.
but
what
happened
here,
it's
not
the
police
officer
who
got
the
individual
out
of
the
car.
what
happened
was,
answering
justice
stevens'
question,
is
that
the
car
was
pulled
over.
before
the
police
officers
even
got
up
to
the
individual's
car,
the
respondent
here,
the
defendant
down
below,
gets
out
of
his
car
and
walks
back
to
the
police
officers'
car.
as
he
was
speaking
to
officer
meyer,
his
partner,
his
regular
partner,
officer
mcnamee,
walked
up
to
the
respondent's
car
to
try
to
look
at
the
vehicle,
inspect
the
vehicle
identification
number.
what
happened
then?
he
assumed
because
it
was
an
older
car,
and
the
earlier
case
before
this
court
that
he
dealt
with
a
very
expensive
car,
this
was
not
such
an
expensive
car.
it
was
a
'72
dodge
duster.
it
was
an
older
car.
the
officer
assumed
the
vin
might
be
on
the
door
jamb
as
the
older
cars
had,
so
he
opened
up
the
car
door
to
look
on
the
door
jamb,
did
not
see
the
vin
number
there.
he
then
knew
that
it
would
have
to
be
in
one
location,
on
the
dashboard
in
a
position
that
should
be
viewable
through
the
windshield,
because
mandatory
federal
regulation
now
says
that
ever
since
1969
the
vin
belongs
there
so
everybody,
including
police
officers,
can
look
at
it.
and,
what
does
he
find?
a
little
bit
of
paper,
a
mischievous
scrap
of
paper,
is
covering
the
vin
number.
so,
although
my
adversary
here--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hate
to
leave
a
question
unanswered,
and
so
if
i
may
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
of
me
by
justice
stevens
at
the
end
of
the
morning's
argument,
the
question
was
did
the
police
officer
do
anything
with
the
vehicle
identification
number,
if
i
remember
the
answer
correctly.
and
the
answer,
justice
stevens,
is
that
he
never
really
had
the
opportunity
to
do
anything
with
it
because
as
he
was
reaching
into
the
car
to
move
the
scrap
of
paper
off
of
the
vin
number
he
looks
down,
and
what
does
he
notice?
lo
and
behold,
sticking
out
from
underneath
the
seat...
he
did
not
look
under
the
seat,
but
sticking
out
by
about
an
inch
is
the
handle
of
a
pistol.
he
recovered
the
pistol
and
then
the
vehicle
identification
number
became
at
least
somewhat
de
minimis
because
what
they
were
confronted
with
then
was
the
felony
of
an
unlawful
weapons
possession.
but
i
would
point
out
also,
the
defendant,
the
respondent
here,
did
receive
two
traffic
infractions
summonses
in
addition
to
being
arrested
for
the
felony
and
to
some
extent
the
vin
number
became
at
least
somewhat...
or
less
important
because
they
also
discovered
during
the
course
of
their
inquiry
and
discussions
with
the
defendant
that
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver
as
well.
so,
the
likelihood
is,
this
was
not
going
to
be
the
type
of
case
where
they
would
check
a
vin
number
and
let
the
defendant
perhaps
drive
on
his
way.
this
was
a
situation
where
he
was
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
get
back
into
that
car
and
drive
it.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
we
do
not
suggest
that
he
was
suspected
of
any
wrongful
conduct
in
the
form
of
a
stealing
of
the
car
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
you
check
the
vin
number
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
only
way
you
can
tell
for
sure
that
a
car
is
the
car
described
in
a
registration
certificate
or
in
an
insurance
card
is
by
comparing
that
number
with
the
vin
number.
if
you
don't
make
that
comparison
those
pieces
of
paper
don't
mean
that
much,
quite
frankly.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
certainly
we
would
suggest
that
under
the
circumstances,
if
he
is
going
to
be
arrested
for
the
weapon,
the
police
have
an
absolute
right
to
check
the
vin
number
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
stolen
that
would
be
an
added
charge
that
he
was
going
to
face.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
i
certainly
think
that
is
a
reasonable
inference
to
draw
from
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
and
indeed,
the
lower
state
courts
found
that
there
was
some
reasonable
suspicion
tied
to
his
getting
out
of
the
vehicle
and
walking
over
to
the
police
car,
but
i
do
not
come
before
the
court
today
to
argue
vigorously
that
that
in
and
of
itself
creates
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
car
is
either
stolen
or
that
there
is
a
weapon
in
the
car.
i
don't
argue
that.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
the
facts
found
by
the
lowest
court,
the
supreme
court,
bronx
county,
the
trial
court,
it
was
reasonable
suspicion.
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
disavowed
that
and
said
that
the
getting
out
of
the
car
in
and
of
itself
does
not
create
that
type
of
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
no.
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--no.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
i
do
not.
but,
i
was
not
the
fact
finder,
and
i'd
say
that
that,
standing
alone,
your
honor,
it
can
be
a
whole
bunch
of
things.
sometimes
a
certain
look
by
an
individual
might
add
to
it,
but--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
the
fact
that
he
got
out
and
walked--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--well,
it
does
in
one
respect,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it
helps
us
in
one
important
respect.
this
court,
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
said
that
in
the
context
of
a
routine
traffic
stop
with
any
concern
that
an
individual
is
armed,
you
have
the
right
to
force
the
individual
to
get
out
of
the
car.
we
didn't
even
have
to
move
the
person.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
that
brings
us,
quite
frankly,
to
a
latter
portion
of
our
brief
which
i'd
like
to
answer
and
that
is,
if
we
are
going
to
be
dealing
with
the
question
of
concern
about
the
individual
being
armed,
and
i
would
suggest
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
search
or
whether
it's
a
reasonable
search,
but
if
we
address
our
last
argument
which
is
that
where
police
have
a
right
to
stop
a
car
initially,
may
they
check
the
car,
perform
a
visual
frisk,
for
purposes
of
finding
out
whether
there's
a
gun,
i
think
that's
something
that
the
law
would
support.
i
think
it
is
reasonable
even
if
he
is
out
of
the
car,
just
as
in
a
belton
situation,
if
an
individual
is
handcuffed,
the
police
still
have
the
right
to
search
the
interior
of
the
car
if
there's
been
a
full-blown
arrest.
we
suggest
that
it
is
a
much
more
fluid
situation
when
someone
has
not
been
subjected
at
that
point
to
the
full-blown
arrest
and
handcuffed,
can
theoretically
get
back
into
the
car
if
he
wishes
to
take
a
desperate
effort
because
he
knows
he's
got
a
gun
there,
and
perhaps
hurt
the
police.
and
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
when
we
address...
and
i
don't
wish
you
to
dwell
on
it
at
great
length
now...
the
final
portion
of
our
argument,
but
i
would
point
out
that
our
final
argument
in
the
brief
in
which
we
argue
that
there
should
be
a
right,
where
there
has
been
a
lawful
traffic
stop,
and
there
exists
the
right
to
execute
a
full
arrest,
if
the
police
officers
decided
whether
or
not
to
do
that
there
should
be
the
right
to
do
a
visual
frisk
of
the
interior
of
the
car
to
protect
the
police
officers.
we
make
that
argument
because
i
think
the
statistics,
the
real
world
statistics,
support
it
and
i
think
the
court
is
very
sensitive
to
police
safety,
both
in
the
belton
context
and
in
the
context
we'd
ask
it
to
be
sensitive
to,
in
sub-point
"d"
of
our
brief.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
absolutely.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
if
the
car
is
in
fact
seized
and
brought
down
to
the
station,
they
would
absolutely
under
new
york
law
do
a
routine
inventory
which
under
south
dakota
v.
opperman
would
be
completely
proper
under
the
circumstances.
so,
in
a
sense
there
would
be
an
inevitable
discovery
type
of
situation.
in
fact,
he's
arrested
for
something
and
brought
down
to
the
police
station.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
that's
not
entirely
clear,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reasons.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
the
traffic
offenses
initially
observed,
but
not
all
of
them,
was
speeding
and
driving
with
a
shattered
windshield.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
i
think
we've
all...
perhaps
we've
all
been
lucky
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
remains
that
under
new
york
law
there
could
have
been
an
arrest.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
i
looked
for
statistics
and
i
could
not
find
any,
on
what
usually
happens.
but
if
i
might
answer
it
and
say,
this
case
is
a
little
different,
your
honor.
in
this
case
not
only
was
there
the
speeding
but
there
was
an
added,
very
important
factor
which
we
address
in
sub-point
"c"
of
our
brief
and
that
is
that
he
was
also
determined
to
be
an
unlicensed
driver.
this
individual,
under
no
circumstances
in
this
case...
the
gun
had
not
been
found,
just
like
an
intoxicated
driver
could
not
be
allowed
to
get
back
into
that
car
and
drive
it
away.
there
is
a
very
substantial
possibility
that
he
would
have
been
arrested
as
well
because--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--no,
i
think
the
record
is
rather
clear,
if
you
look
at
page
836
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver
and
in
fact
received
a
summons
for
being
an
unlicensed
driver,
not
that
he
wasn't
carrying
it
on
that
day
but
that
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver,
and
that
was
the
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
one
of
the
police
officers
learned
that
at
the
scene.
he
was
speaking--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--no.
the
police
officer
at
the
scene,
i
believe
was
told
by
the
defendant
that
he
was
an
unlicensed
driver.
i
mean,
he
determined
that
he
was
unlicensed.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
that
is
one
of
our
substantial
points,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
even
if
you
were
to
find
that
putting
aside
the
larger
argument,
which
is
the
general
right
of
police
officers
to
enter
a
car
in
conjunction
with
a
routine
traffic
stop
such
as
this,
particularly
when
you're
dealing
with
an
unlicensed
driver,
there
has
to
be
because
of
that
status
as
a
wrongful
driver
on
the
highways
an
expectation
that
if
you
are
lawfully
stopped
there
will
have
to
be
some
police
intrusion
into
the
interior
of
your
vehicle
to
pull
it
over,
lock
it,
or
tow
it
away.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
there
were
two
police
officers.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
he...
the
word
was
"got
in
the
car".
if
i
might
suggest,
i
don't
view
this
as
a
getting
in
the
car.
admittedly,
there
was
a
technical
entry.
he
opened
the
door
and
reached
into
it.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
reached
into
it,
if
i
may
be
permitted,
your
honor.
he
reached
into
the
car.
it's
not
even
a
full
body
entry,
as
in
some
cases,
and
he
did
that
before
he
learned
that
it
was
an
unlicensed
driver.
but
his
partner
at
the
scene
did
know
that.
we
suggest,
and
it
is
one
of
the
arguments
in
our
brief,
and
it's
not
such
a
novel
proposition,
there
are
certainly
circuit
court
decisions
from
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
accept
the
concept
of
police
team
knowledge.
it
should
be
the
knowledge,
the
combined
knowledge
of
the
state,
made
up
of
both
police
officers
at
the
scene,
that
should
govern
the
quantum
of
knowledge
that
the
police
officers
had
to
justify
the
action.
if
i
might
get
back--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--i
see
what
your
honor
is
saying.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we're
going
to
give
the
knowledge
of
one
police
officer
to
the
whole
police
department.
if
i
may,
that's
not
my
point.
my
point
is
the
urge
upon
the
court
an
acceptance
of
what
is
called
the
police
team
knowledge.
that
way,
there
are
two
police
officers
at
the
scene
of
an
incident.
you
don't
give
them
all
of
the
knowledge
of
every
police
officer
in
new
york
city,
but
the
combined
knowledge
of
those
two
police
officers
should
justify
whatever
action
the
state
takes,
and
you
should
not
have
to
parse
out,
that's
what
this
police
officer
knew,
that's
what
the
other
officer
knew.
if
i
might
suggest,
we
don't
have
to
accept
that
principle
to
say
that
this
was
a
reasonable
search
under
the
circumstances.
i
have
argued,
and
i
think
legitimately,
that
it
is
not
a
search
at
all
because
there
was
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
vin
number
or
the
information
in
it,
nor
could
the
defendant
or
respondent
create
a
legitimate
or
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
by
allowing
a
piece
of
paper
to
cover
that
vin
number,
just
as
the
people
in
oliver
could
not
create
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
by
putting
up
"don't
trespass"
signs.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
that
could
not
be
the
decision
of
the
manufacturer
because
by
federal
regulation
it
must
be
where
it's
located
in
the
dashboard,
precisely
for
the
reason
that
everybody
can
see
it.
but
if
i
may
answer
your
question,
if
it's
under
the
hood,
let
us
say,
or
in
the
back
seat
and
there
was
a
legitimate
basis
for
checking
the
vehicle
identification
number,
yes,
we
would
say
that
if
police
officers
know
that
that's
where
the
vehicle
identification
number
is,
they
have
the
right
to
check
it
out
once
probable
cause
exists,
and
you
do
have
probable
cause
here
for
the
traffic
infractions.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
that
is
one
of
our
arguments,
sort
of,
your
honor,
if
i
might
say,
and
that
is
we
don't
advocate
rambling
searches.
what
we
do
say
is
this.
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
effect
an
arrest,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
we
do
believe
the
police
should
have
the
right
for
a
different
reason
to
engage
in
a
self-protective
visual
frisk,
if
you
will,
of
the
interior
of
the
car.
if
i
might
be
permitted
to,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
that
i
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
your
honors,
if
i
may
be
allowed
a
reply,
i
think
as
the
questions
of
this
court
have
pointed
up
to
some
extent,
the
respondent
brought
the
police
action
in
this
case
on
himself
to
some
extent.
he
allowed
the
vin
to
be
covered.
he
chose
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
walk
away
from
it.
my
colleague...
or
my
adversary,
i
should
say,
here,
seems
to
suggest
that
the
fourth
amendment
should
be
something
that
rewards
a
motorist
for
defeating
the
congressional
intent
in
having
exposed
vin
numbers,
that
if
he
chooses
not
to
keep
it
exposed
as
expected
by
congress
the
fourth
amendment
should
rule
it
improper
if
a
police
officer
merely
reaches
in
to
uncover
the
vin.
i
suggest...
the
silliness,
i
think
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
position
that
what
the
police
had
to
do
here
was
send
the
individual
back
into
the
car
to
move
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
the
way
himself
is
pointed
up
and
underscored
by
the
fract
that
the
police
do
have
some
right
to
be
concerned
about
police
safety,
and
as
justice
marshall
and
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
their
dissent
in
the
michigan
v.
long
case,
they
thought
that
if
we're
concerned
about
police
safety
once
the
individual's
out
of
the
car,
the
most
minimal
thing
to
do
is
for
the
police
officer
to
go
into
the
car
if
he's
looking
for
a
registration,
once
the
motorist
has
told
him
where
it
is,
and
go
to
that
certainly
identifiable
place.
here,
this
police
officer
was
not
engaged
in
a
rummaging
search
of
the
car.
he
looked
under
no
seats.
he
went
to
the
place
on
the
dashboard,
moving
across
open
space,
where
he
expected
the
vin
to
be
located,
happened
to
look
down
and
see
a
gun
butt.
and,
if
i
might
respond
to
something
justice
white
spoke
about,
could
the
police
officer
even
have
seen
it
from
outside,
possibly?
yes.
why?
because
it's
a
settled
fact
in
this
case,
the
gun
butt
was
out
one
inch
from
under
the
seat.
now,
it's
true
that
this
police
officer
didn't
notice
it
at
the
time,
although
a
pedestrian
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
might
have
been
able
to,
and
i
think
texas
v.
brown
says
the
police
will
have
the
same
rights
as
any
pedestrian
on
the
street.
the
police
officers
might
have
been
able
to
see
it
from
outside
the
car.
so--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--excuse
me?
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
it
was
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon.
it
had
rained
earlier
in
the
day
but
it
was
daylight
out,
no
flashlights
necessary.
had
he
been
looking
for
a
gun
he
might
have
seen
it.
it
happened
to
pop
up,
if
you
will,
or
jumped
out
and
bit
him
as
he
happened
to
be
reaching
across,
but
it
really
was
sticking
out
in
plain
view
from
under
the
seat.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
plain
view,
i
would
certainly...
once
the
door
was
opened,
we
believe,
reasonably...
but
it
would
seem
pretty
obvious
from
outside
the
car
had
the
police
officer
been
looking
for
it.
i
say
this,
justice
rehnquist,
because
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
in
this
case
that
out
from
under
the
seat,
towards
the
front
of
the
car
by
at
least
one
inch,
was
the
observable,
identifiable
gun
butt.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
you
asked
me
can
it
be
done,
i
think
it
can
be
done.
to
see
if
it
could
be
done
i
went
to
a
car,
i
mean
to
see
what
the
views
were,
i
went
to
the
other
side
rather
than
the
driver's
side,
looked
in
the
open
window,
and
you
really
can't
see
everything
coming
out
an
inch
from
under
the
seat
of
a
car.
but,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
determine
that
in
this
case.
i
just
suggest
that
it
was
not
the
type
of
rummaging
search
that
the
court
need
believe
it
implicates
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
really
sticking
out
from
under
the
seat.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
i
think
what
he
testified,
your
honor,
was
that
he
wasn't
looking
for
a
gun
at
that
time.
he
was
just
looking
to
check
the
vin
number
and
happened
to
notice
the
gun
as
he
was
reaching
in.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
well,
no.
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--he
approached
it
from
the
driver's
side,
your
honor.
all
i'm
saying--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--no,
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
just
a
viewing
from
the
other
side
might
have
allowed
for
it,
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
court
said
in
texas
v.
brown,
the
fact
that
a
police
officer
may
be
able
to
twist
his
head
and
see
something
on
an
angle
puts
him
in
the
same
position
as
any
pedestrian.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
and
we
suggest
that
this
was
a
very--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--well,
i
think
the
way
he
legitimately
opens
the
door
to
look
at
the
vin
numbers
because
looking
at
that
vin
number
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
probable
cause
to
deal
with
the
traffic
infractions
that
he
observed.
had
the
paper
not
covered
the
vin,
he
might
have
noticed
it
from
outside.
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
absolutely,
your
honor.
we
think
that's
clear,
and
we
think
there
was
a
very
reasonable--
mr.
steven
p.
kartagener
--well,
i
suggest
that
you
don't
have
to
decide
the
broad
issue,
if
it's
anywhere
in
the
car,
but
certainly
when
it's
on
the
dashboard.
yes,
i
would
suggest
that
in
any
case
where
a
vin
number's
covered
on
the
dash,
and
the
driver
stepped
away
from
the
car,
it's
not
necessary
for
the
police
under
mimms
to
bring
the
driver
back
to
the
car,
to
open
up
the
door
and
step
in,
and
indeed
they
probably
would
have
seen
the
gun
at
that
point
anyway.
so,
in
closing,
i'd
simply
like
to
say
that
we
would
like
the
court
to
find,
as
we
think
that
it
should,
that
the
actions
of
the
police
officers
in
this
case
were
so
eminently
reasonable,
and
the
ruling
and
opinion
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
not
reasonable,
and
therefore
that
you
should
reverse
that
judgment
of
that
court.
thank
you
very
much.
