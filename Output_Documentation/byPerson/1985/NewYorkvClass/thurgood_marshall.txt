justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
go
back...
you
skipped
over...
the
wording
is
exactly
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
when
they're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment,
could
they
possibly
be
talking
about
the
new
york--
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
an
unarmed
man
walks
up
to
two
policemen,
you
think
that's
suspicious?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
help
me
to
decide
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn't
help
me
to
decide--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
were
you
worried
about
this
man
being
armed,
when
the
gun's
in
the
car
and
he's
out
of
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
use
the
computer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
use
the
computer,
if
every
officer's
got
all
of
the
information?
i
don't
know
what
you
are
trying
to
tell
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
an
officer
in
new
york
knows
what
all
of
the
officers...
how
many
officers
do
you
have
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
court
had
said,
we
do
this
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
and
our
statute,
we
wouldn't
have
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
did
you
urge
them
to
rule
on
the
federals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
didn't
urge
the
federal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
you
argue
just
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
you
read
the
record,
he
opened
the
door,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
reached
in
for
the
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
never
went
in
there,
he
never
went
in
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
never
went
in
there?
well,
he
did
put
his
rear
end
in
there,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
top
end,
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
top
end,
of
his
body?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
as
far
as
he
went,
when
he
saw
the
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
he
saw
the
gun
did
he
have
a
right
to
search
everything
in
reason,
once
he
saw
a
felony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
possession
of
a
gun
in
new
york
is
a
felony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
search
everything,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did,
without
entering
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
eyeballs
entered
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
give
him
a
vin.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that's
in
the
body,
metal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
part
of
the
vehicle.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you
can't
hand
it
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
for
me
to
assume
that
if
that
were
true,
the
policeman
would
have
so
testified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
characterize
that
he
could
see
it
from
the
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
did--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--so,
now
you
are
going
to
testify
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
your
problem
is
to
get
the
officer
into
the
car
to
look
at
the
vin
number.
