mr.
kartagener.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
inquire
whether
under
new
york
law,
new
york
would
have
required
exclusion
of
the
evidence
in
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
asking
you,
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
because
presumably
you
practice
law
there
and
are
familiar
with
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cogan,
if
there
were
a
situation
here
where
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
place
mr.
class
under
arrest,
would
they
then
have
the
right
to
enter
the
vehicle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
some
other
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
certainly
have
the
power
to
enter
the
car
and
inventory
it
under
those
circumstances,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what's
the
difference?
