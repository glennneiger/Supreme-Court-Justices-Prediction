mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
1972,
this
court
had
charged
school
boards
to
step
up
to
their
fourteenth
amendment
duties
to
end
discrimination
and
integrate
their
schools,
advising
boards
to
evaluate
the
total
facts
and
to
review
a
wide
range
of
factors.
this
is
exactly
what
the
jackson
board
did
as
a
part
of
a
comprehensive,
four-year
study.
the
board
knew
that
the
district
had
discriminated
against
students
and
faculty.
the
jackson
board
further
knew
minority
teachers
would
be
necessary
for
faculty
integration
and
were
educationally
essential
to
aid
students
who
will
live
in
the
society.
the
educational
policy
was
sound
and
the
governmental
interest
was
compelling.
article
xii
was
but
a
part
of
total
integration.
it
was
arrived
at
bilaterally.
all
the
teachers'
views
were
represented.
it
is
clearly
designed
so
that
the
gains
made
would
not
be
in
vain
and
destroyed
in
the
event
of
a
decline
in
total
student
enrollment.
article
xii
did
not
place
the
burden
on
any
one
group.
it
was
believed
by
all
the
parties
to
be
applicable.
all
parties'
interests
were
represented.
the
collective
bargaining
process
itself
was
a
significant
safeguard
because
of
its
adversary
nature.
article
xii,
which
is
part
of
the
overall
layoff
language,
takes
race
into
account,
however,
it
is
the
one
part
of
a
layoff
clause
which
takes
into
account
as
well
curriculum
and
program.
now,
no
animus
on
the
part
of
the
board
or
the
union
has
been
alleged
by
the
petitioners.
there
has
been
no
allegation
that
this
language
was
enacted
to
harm
these
petitioners
in
particular
or
whites
in
general,
this
is
part
clearly
of
a
remedial
effort
to
cure
the
vestiges
of
discrimination
and
to
enhance
the
educational
opportunities
of
jackson
students.
now,
the
rights
of
employees
were
balanced
against
the
needs
of
a
sound
educational
system
and
were
enacted
by
responsible
parties.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
it
certainly
did.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
certainly
it
did
and
in
the
first
case--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--in
jackson
one
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
now,
jackson
one,
bear
in
mind,
however...
judge
demascio,
i
think,
makes
this
very
clear
in
his--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--different
issues,
however.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
justice
powell,
first
of
all,
when
this
case
was
tried
before
judge
demascio
it
wasn't
a
question
of
whether
or
not
jackson
was
going
to
integrate
its
schools.
i
think
judge
demascio
made
it
very
clear,
there
was
no
effort
made
and
no
proofs
put
in
to
prove
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
don't
forget,
were
the
union
and
the
black
teachers
simply
attempting
to
enforce
the
labor
agreement.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
your
honor,
not
only
did
jackson--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--that
is
certainly
correct.
jackson
had
not
only
voluntarily
integrated
and
when
we
were
sued
here...
very
frankly
the
jackson
board
at
that
point
didn't
want
to
open
itself
up
if
it
didn't
need
to
to
that
type
of
an
admission
and
the
possibility
of
other
lawsuits.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
no
judicial
by
the
board.
the
board,
i
think--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--you
have,
of
course,
the
naacp.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
judicial
determination
and
it
was
a
voluntary
effort
to
integrate
and
there
was
no
reason
for
a
trial.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
that
is
correct
for
those
reasons.
now,
let
me
also
say
as
to
the
facts
and
the
stipulated
record,
justice
powell,
that
jackson
surely
knew
what
was
going
on
there,
but
didn't
want
to
flail
itself
publicly
either...
frankly,
when
we
were
establishing
the
stipulated
record
for
this
case
and
certainly
not
in
the
matter
before
judge
demascio.
in
that
issue,
it
wasn't
a
question
of
asking
the
federal
court
to
write
this
contract
language.
the
contract
language
existed.
the
characterization
that
because
jackson
one
occurred
is
somehow
supportive
to
the
petitioners,
i
think,
is
in
error.
and,
a
reading
of
judge
demascio's
opinion,
i
think,
will
support
it.
one,
no...
as
i
say,
they
weren't
attempting...
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
weren't
attempting
to
prove
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
they
didn't
have
to
prove
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim.
no
one
was
asking
the
court
to
rewrite
this
type
of
language.
they
already
had
it.
the
only
issue
there
raised
by
the
board...
in
fact,
i
think
mr.
oade
kind
of
mentions
it
here
himself...
is
the
question
between
tenured
teachers
and
non-tentured.
now,
that
was
resolved
in
the
state
court
under
michigan
state
law.
the
following
year
all
the
minority
teachers,
in
fact,
had
tenure
and
the
board
didn't
take
that
position.
even
though
that
litigation
was
pending,
the
labor
agreement,
collectively
bargained,
was
followed.
so,
i
think
that
is,
with
all
due
respect,
a
red
herring
on
that
particular
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board,
having
been
told
by
this
court...
i
am
not
saying
that
you
told
jackson
specifically...
but
it
seems
to
me
the
clear
word
that
was
sort
of
getting
out,
particularly
after
brown
two
and
swann.
i
don't
mean
to
be
paraphrasing
perhaps
what
was
going
on
here,
but
it
seems
that
the
court
had
perhaps
had
it
with
some
of
the
cases
that
kept
coming
up
here
with
the
same
issues
being
raised.
we
certainly
felt
that
you
would
have
to
look
where
do
you
have
your
students
placed,
what
kind
of
faculty
do
you
have,
and
if
you
are
going
to
integrate,
this
just
wasn't
one
issue
you
would
look
at,
you
would
look
at
where
the
students
are,
where
the
faculty
is,
and
i
certainly
find
it...
and,
one
of
the
things
we
should
have
done,
and,
indeed,
look
at
is
as
long
as
we
were
doing
all
of
these
things
under
our
fourteenth
amendment
duties,
should
we
not,
after
all,
this
being
an
educational
institution,
understand
what
it
might
do
for
us
educationally
and
culturally.
and,
i
think
the
decision--
once
you
had,
as
an
example,
the
stipulated
to
naacp
complaint
in
1969,
i
think
everybody
got
looking
at
this
and
said,
gee,
you
know,
this
is
not
only
the
right
thing
to
do,
but
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
educationally,
let's
have
a
culturally,
ethnically
diverse
faculty.
no
one
seems
to
quarrel
with
the
competency
of
the
board
to
do
that
and
no
one
seems
to
have
suggested
that
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
it.
so,
i
guess
the
main
fault
we
seem
to
have
here
is
that
because
we
don't
have
a
really
good
record
is
because
we
voluntarily
integrated.
now,
had
we
been
like
dayton
or
like
columbus
or
detroit
and
refused
to
integrated,
did
not
obey
this
court's
order
until
somebody
sued
us
and
made
us
do
it,
we
would
have
the
record
you
would
want.
but,
jackson
voluntarily
integrated
and,
therefore,
it
doesn't
have
the
record.
so,
we
are
sort
of
in
a
catch-22
situation
on
that.
we
either
seemed
to
do
what
this
court
wanted
us
to
do
and
integrate
and
evaluate
all
those
factors.
you
know,
this
wasn't
some
hasty
decision.
it
was
done
over
a
four-year
period
and
it
wasn't
just
the
board.
it
was
the
jackson
board,
it
was
a
blue-ribbon
committee,
it
was
an
ad
hoc
committee
of
faculty
and
administrators,
it
was
the
minority
affairs
office,
you
had
had
the
naacp's
complaints.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
four
years
one
could
make
this
sort
of
determination.
now,
i
agree
with
mr.
oade.
it
is
not
a
hiring
case.
article
vii
are
goals,
simple
goals
of
what
they
thought
would
be
nice.
it
is
article
xii
that
tells
you
how
you
layoff.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
i
would
certainly
want
to
look
at
all
the
facts
of
the
remedial
nature.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
they
should
be
looked
at.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
as
the
district
court,
of
course,
did.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
your
honor,
let
me
make
it
very
clear
that
what
jackson
was
looking
at,
both
in
1972...
and
i
will
be
glad
to
answer
that
further
if
the
court
should
desire.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
certainly.
it
was
looking
at
the
fact
it
had
to
integrate,
to
look
at
the
faculty
and
the
students.
i
am
talking
about
the
students
by
placement
and
the
need
for
integration
and
where
the
faculty
was
placed
and
what
they
would
have
to
address
on
that
issue.
but,
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time
they
were
dealing
with
the
question
of
integration,
they
also
were
dealing
with
the
issue
of
educational
soundness,
for
a
diversified
faculty,
and
dealing
with
that
problem.
now,
if
you
are
asking
me
which
is
more
important,
they
were
both
equally
important.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
justice
o'connor,
i
didn't
say
that
and
i
didn't
mean
that.
i
think
what
i
was
looking
at
specifically
was
was
it
their
duty
to
integrate,
how
to
go
about
that
integration,
and
certainly
at
the
same
time...
and
we
make
no
apology
for
it...
educationally--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--may
i
would
just
like
to,
if
i
may
for
you,
lay
out
some
facts
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
looking
at
in
carrying
on
this
discussion.
you
know,
before
1954
there
was
not
one
minority
teacher
in
the
jackson
public
schools.
two
hundred
and
fifty
teachers
were
hired
during
the
50's.
one
of
them
was
a
minority
teacher.
now,
during
that
period...
let's
take
1953
and
1954...
you
had
9,966
students,
355
teachers,
and
one
of
them
was
black.
in
1961,
you
had
12,611
students,
515
teachers,
and
ten
of
them
were
minority.
now,
by
1971,
and
this
is
stipulated
to
in
the
record,
they
went
on
an
intensive
recruitment
program
to
bring
teachers
in.
now,
in
1972,
okay,
you
actually
had
the
integration
plan
which
now
went
to
busing
and
went
to
the
allocation
of
the
faculty.
you
just
had
those
hiring
gains.
now,
the
reason
it
is
addressed
in
article
xii
is
if
you
are
not
going
to
do
something
about
layoffs
is
it
going
to
be
considered
by
the
public
as
a
good
faith
effort
to
integrate.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
we
have
just
dismantled
a
segregated
system.
we
have
just
moved
to
a
unitary
system
instead
of
a
dual
system
and
to
protect
the
gains
made
that
was
going
to
allow
us
to
do
that
as
we
looked
at
what
we
certainly
thought
were
some
of
the
factors
we
ought
to
be
looking
at
like
faculty
and
wanting
a
diverse
ethnic
faculty,
to
protect
that
we
had
to
have
article
xii.
it
is
the
only
place--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--at
that
point
in
time,
justice
o'connor,
when
you
look
at
the
number
of
schools
we
had
and
the
number
of
minority
teachers
we
had,
about
the
first
time
you
were
going
to
get
a
layoff...
we
had
just
gone
through
this
hiring
effort
to
bring
in
these
teachers.
if
you
are
not
going
to
protect
them
in
a
layoff,
you
are
really
going
through
an
exercise
in
futility
in
hiring
in
the
first
place.
we
wanted
them
there.
we
had
to
have
a
method
of
protecting
them.
and,
you
know,
everybody
is
concerned
about
fairness.
jackson,
having
nothing
else
to
do
with
its
time,
had
to
run
around
just
simply
discriminating
against
whites
at
random.
when
we
decided
why
this
layoff
program
was
needed,
we
knew
that
minority
teachers
at
a
minimum
had
at
least
five
years
less
seniority.
if
you
are
going
to
apply
straight
"inverse
orders
to
minorities",
those
gains
were
going
to
be
long
gone
pretty
quickly.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
certainly
it
is
part
of
integration.
i
think
the
courts,
obviously
after
this
court
decided...
we
were
integrating
that
district.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
mystic
in
this
record
after
all
those
four
years
and
everything
that
district
went
to...
by
the
way,
it
was
certainly
not
welcomed
with
open
arms
by
everyone
in
jackson,
but
it
did
integrate
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
was
involved
in
integration.
that
is
what
the
compelling
state
interest
was
from
that
standpoint.
the
education
interest
is
equally
important
to
the
board.
i
can't
separate
them
for
you,
because
we
couldn't
separate
them
for
you
and
the
people
involved
here,
kids,
is
what
was
good
for
these
children
in
this
educational
program,
but
it
is
what
the
board
was
concerned
with,
not
whether
or
not
teacher
x
or
teacher
y
was
laid
off.
and,
these
teachers...
let
me
tell
you
this
and
i
think
it
has
been
highly
responsible...
because
they
have
subordinated
seniority,
not
only...
that
is
why
i
don't
want
to
have
some
belief
here
that
the
only
thing
we
are
talking
about
is
article
xii.
it
is
subordinated
to
protect
programs,
it
is
subordinated
to
take
care
of
such
things
as
elementary
art,
music,
and
the
like.
it
is
subordinated
to
take
care
of
curriculum.
and,
if
one
of
these
teachers
had
been
laid
off
because
we
had
to
protect
latin,
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
here.
no
one
would
say
that
because
these
teachers
who
bargained
to
subordinate
seniority
for
the
good
of
the
program
or
for
the
good
of
the
kids'
education,
that
some
how
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
but,
for
heaven's
sake,
in
this
case
to
have
diverse
faculty,
we
also
mentioned
the
nasty
word
"race".
so,
if
one
of
them
happens
to
be
laid
off
for
that
reason,
now
we
are
here
constitutionally.
yet,
to
deal
with
the
issues
presented
to
the
district
of
what
do
you
do
about
integrating
and
looking
at
your
faculty
and
having
a
diverse
faculty,
you
have
to
address
it
somewhere
in
the
layoff
clause
or
you
would
be
right
back
to
where
you
started
from
in
short
order.
i
don't
know
where
else
you
would
address
it
but
in
layoff.
now,
you
know,
article
vii
is,
indeed,
a
goal.
it
is
a
hiring
policy.
it
is
not
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
it
has
to
be
bargained
about.
layoffs
do
happen
to
be
collectively
bargained
and
they
were.
these
parties
reviewed
it
in
1977.
this
contract
had
been
ratified
eight
times.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
justice
stevens,
i
regret
to
tell
you--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--i
can't
honestly
tell
you.
i
can
tell
you
that
the
majority
teachers
certainly
had
about...
or
the
minority
teachers
have
an
average
of
five
years
or
less
seniority.
you
see,
the
problem
is
a
lot
of
this
applies
to
what
program.
you
can
have
a
many-year
teacher
end
up
being
laid
off
without
any
regard
to
the
racial
question.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
right.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
that
is
right.
if
they
were
going
to
lay
off,
for
instance,
ten
people
in
the
high
school,
it
may
turn
out
that
your
ten
less
senior
is
your
math
department
or
your
entire
foreign
language
department.
that
is
why
you
have
to
really
look
to
the
makeup
of
that
particular
layoff.
it
may
end
up
with
somebody
with
ten
years'
seniority,
as
an
example,
ends
up
getting
laid
off
without
any
relationship
to
the
question
that
brings
us
before
this
court
today.
that
is
why
it
is
really
impossible
without
sitting
down
and
laying
that
all
out
at
any
point
in
time
and
say
this
is
why
it
happened
because
that
really
may
not
be
why
it
happened
at
all.
you
know,
when
these
parties
looked
at
this
issue,
i
think
they
very
clearly
recognized
what
is
going
to
happen
when
you
subordinate
your
seniority.
not
only
in
1972,
but
each
time
they
looked
at
the
contract
and
certainly
in
1977...
and,
by
the
way,
by
the
time
you
get
to
1977
these
layoffs
are
now
getting
chronic
because
you
are
having
a
rather
significant
decline.
here
you
are
looking
at,
first
of
all,
what
is
needed
in
the
building,
what
is
needed
in
a
particular
program,
elementary
music,
elementary
art,
so
these
parties
certainly
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
the
language
from
article
xii
really
hasn't
changed
the
principle
at
all.
it
was
certainly
there.
now,
all
the
teachers
involved
we
are
discussing
are
all
qualified.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
they
weren't
hired
in
an
individualized
way.
merit
isn't
involved.
you
know,
one
of
the
issues
certainly
this
court
has
focused
on
in
reviewing
this
problem
is
somebody
is
stigmatized.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
so
are
a
variety
of
other
factors,
justice
white.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
well,
you
know,
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
don't
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
sir.
all
of
the
other
factors--
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
--that
is
true,
but
all
i
am
saying
is
when
you
are
looking
at
the
total
layoffs,
justice
white,
you
are
looking
at
all
of
these
other
reasons.
now,
quite
frankly
you
have
got
to
recognize
this,
if
some
of
these
other
problems,
for
instance,
protection
of
some
of
these
other
programs,
hadn't
been
what
they
were,
that
teacher
might
have
been
laid
off.
so,
to
suggest
very
honestly
that
the
only
reason
was
that,
i
think,
is
inappropriate
and
inappropriate
in
the
record.
now,
you
know,
there
isn't
anything
in
article
xii
at
all
that
indicates
there
is
any
tie
between
article
xii
and
the
minority
student
population.
article
vii,
as
i
have
said,
is
a
goal.
and,
when
moses
came
down
with
the
ten
commandments,
they
were
commandments.
this
is
a
goal
and
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
article
xii.
sure,
it
is
a
hiring
position.
we
have
a
non-discrimination
clause
in
that
labor
agreement
also
and
this
is
what
we
would
like
to
have.
you
know,
we
are
never
probably
going
to
get
it
because
of
what
the
goal
is
because
of
the
decline
in
teachers,
but
when
go
to
the
layoff
clause,
all
it
does
it
protect
against
elimination.
it
limits
not
numerically
but
by
a
percentage
against
this
minimal
number
with
less
seniority
from
being
eliminated.
it
doesn't
say
anything
in
there
that
you
can't
lay
them
off.
white
teachers
and
minority
teachers
are
both
laid
off.
they
are
not
immunitized
by
this
by
any
means.
so,
i
think
the
attempt
to
take
article
vii
and
say,
well,
this
is
going
to
be
here
forever
for
this
reason
would
not
be
a
proper
interpretation
respectfully
of
that
labor
agreement.
now,
let
me
suggest
that
no
bad
faith
from
anyone
against
either
the
union
or
the
board.
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
of
that
as
has
been
alleged.
this
is
a
question
of
diversity
for
the
benefit
of
the
students.
so,
as
we
are
looking
at
it
from,
an
educational
standpoint,
and
i
suggest
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest.
to
end
a
discriminatory
system
does
not
seem
to
be
in
keeping
with
what
this
court
had
been
saying
in
the
70's
and
certainly
up
to
the
time
when
jackson
was
first
integrated.
you
know,
this
is
not
a
situation...
these
parties
were
reviewing
this
on
a
regular
basis.
it
has
a
definite
life
span
as
does
anything
else
in
a
labor
agreement.
to
suggest
sort
of
in
a
whisper
that
somehow
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
process...
and
i
am
not
saying
the
court
ought
to
yield
to
constitutional
questions
to
a
labor
agreement
necessarily...
but
i
would
rather
expect
that
we
know
it
is
part
of
integration,
we
know
it
is
part
of
that
plan,
and
you
know
why
you
have
done
it;
that
rather
than
a
whisper
that
perhaps
there
is
some
impropriety
in
that
process,
there
would
be
some
real
allegations
and
some
real
proof
and
the
petitioners
never
put
in
anything
in
this
case,
including
the
pleadings.
in
the
sad
history
of
really
what
occurred
after
brown
two,
jackson,
i
think
recognizing
the
time
to
come,
elected
to
obey
this
court's
decisions
and
the
law
by
voluntarily
integrating.
in
doing
so
it
didn't
wait
to
be
sued,
only
obey
the
law
when
it
knew
it
had
to
obey
it.
now,
the
language
under
attack
here
certainly
arises,
as
we
have
already
discussed
perhaps
longer
than
we
should
have,
from
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
one
which
we
say
certainly
is
educationally
sound.
now,
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
that
school
boards
have
a
specialized
ability
to
perhaps
deal
with
these
educational
issues.
we
furnish
students
with
an
ethnically
diverse
faculty
so
they
can
learn
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society
and
that
certainly
is
one
of
the
goals
and
it
is
certainly
still
true
today.
now,
through
education
the
time
is
going
to
come
when
society
will
be
able
to
be
truly
colorblind
and
judge
people
as
i
think
this
court
would
want
it
to
without
regard
to
race.
this
is
not,
however,
we
would
suggest
to
move
back
20
years.
it
is
the
time
to
move
forward
where
these
issues
that
you
have
here
aren't
going
to
be
before
this
court.
certainly
the
best
place
for
this
matter
to
be
dealt
with
are
in
your
educational
halls.
how
are
you
going
to
deal
with
that
if
we
aren't
going
to
have
this
type
of
diverse
ethnic
faculty
to
work.
and,
is
the
board
going
to
be
second
guessed
in
its
good
faith
effort
when
it
was
supposed
to
be
looking
at
whether
or
not
it
should
integrate,
when
it
did
so
over
a
four-year
period,
and
it
attempted
to
address
the
problem
through
the
layoff
clause
not
unilaterally,
but
with
its
teachers
through
the
adversary
process
of
collective
bargaining.
this
is
really
a
situation
that
is
a
little
bit
different.
this
wasn't
a
court
ordered
integration
case
and
it
certainly
wasn't
court-imposed
language.
these
parties
not
only
agreed
to
it
in
1972,
but
these
competent
teachers,
all
of
whom
are
well
degreed,
have
felt
it
a
good
idea
to
continue
this
right
through
to
the
present
date.
they
are
aware
of
this
case
too.
now,
it
is
necessary
to
say
you
ought
to
yield
to
them,
but
i
would
certainly
suggest
in
a
constitutional
review
of
the
issue
that
there
are
some
pretty
strong
process
considerations
that
these
people,
indeed,
have
not
been
abused.
you
have
a
good
faith
effort
of
competent
parties,
designed
to
protect
the
gains
made,
not
to
harm
these
petitioners
or
anybody
else.
we
would
suggest
on
that
basis
that
the
language
of
article
xii
found
so
offensive
by
the
petitioners
should
not
be
found
offensive
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
you
know,
this
case
at
bar
here
was
presented
on
stipulated
facts,
stipulated
to
the
district
court,
no
factual
question
was
ever
raised
before
the
sixth
circuit.
we
believe
the
governmental
interest
is
compelling,
so
is
the
educational
interest.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
well,
i
didn't
write
that.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
i
didn't
write
that.
hispanics
may
have
been
a
better
term.
i
guess
we
just
didn't
think
about
it,
justice
powell,
at
that
point.
i
think
we
were
looking
at
having
hispanic
people.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
certainly,
sir.
mr.
jerome
a.
susskind
you
know...
let
me
say
one
thing
about
this
role
model
question
if
i
may
and
which
i
think
will
give
you
an
answer
to
your
question.
now,
we
weren't
hiring
black
teachers
that
could
teach
blacks.
we
had
that
problem.
that
is
exactly
why
we...
we
wouldn't
hire
an
american
indian
to
each
indians
either.
what
if
we
wanted
an
oriental
or
american
indian.
that
is
part
of
a
diverse
faculty.
and,
if
you
want
people
to
exist
here
in
this
ethnic
scheme,
in
this
pluralistic
scheme
that
i
think
we
have...
if
you
had
an
all
white
district
and
you
wanted
to
have
some
black
teachers,
i
think
that
might
be
a
very
good
idea.
in
michigan,
with
the
competition
we
have
with
the
japanese,
let
me
tell
you,
i
think
it
might
be
a
real
good
idea,
except
for
the
fact
we
might
be
sued
by
someone
who
got
laid
off,
if
we
might
not
get
some
japanese.
so
far
i
will
admit
that
we
haven't
been
under
attack
by
the
indians
other
than
perhaps
by
these
petitioners,
but
i
really
think
that...
an
ethnic
diverse
faculty
we
think
is
a
very
good
idea
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
allow
us
to
continue
to
do
that.
