mr.
farris,
do
you
think
that
a
school
board
has
the
right
to
look
at
its
employees
overall
and
to
look
at
the
number
of
black
employees
it
has
and
the
number
of
black
employees
available
in
that
immediate
area
for
employment
in
jobs
in
the
school
and
conclude
for
itself
that
the
school
hasn't
done
as
much
as
it
should
have
to
employ
black
employees
and
develop
a
program
to
implement
some
effort
to
hire
more
black
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
it,
as
part
of
the
program,
adopt
some
kind
of
layoff
policy
like
this
if
it
felt
it
were
necessary
to
complete
the
implementation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
do
you
think
it
is
possible
under
the
kind
of
inquiry
i
suggested?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
as
applied
to
just
hiring
you
wouldn't
make
that
same
argument,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know,
but
the
court
has
to
be
mindful
of
the
whole
picture
in
resolving
cases,
so
that
is
kind
of
unrealistic
to
decline
to
answer,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
unconstitutional
to
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
within
the
public
sector
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
susskind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
normally
classifications
based
on
race
are
constitutionally
suspect.
i
suppose
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
are
suspect,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
classifications
based
on
race?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
normally
i
guess
the
court
would
look
to
see
whether
the
government
can
demonstrate
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
such
a
classification
if
it
made
one.
now,
what
is
the
compelling
interest
that
the
school
board
asserts
here?
is
it
to
maintain
a
faculty/student
ratio
or
is
it
some
other
purpose?
what
do
you
rely
on
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
a
short
answer
in
response
to
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
board
does
rely
essentially
on
faculty/student
ratio
and
the
role
model
rationale.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
integrate
in
hiring.
you
are
talking
about
hiring
employees,
integrate
hiring?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
i
can't
get
an
answer,
but
i
really
would
like
to
know
what
the
compelling
state
interest
is
that
you
are
relying
on
for
this
particular
layoff
provision
in
a
nutshell.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
preserve
a
faculty/student
ratio
that
the
board
thought
was
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
is
a
knotty
problem
and
it
leads
to
the
next
question
which
is
what
means
can
be
used
to
achieve
a
compelling
state
interest
if
you
find
that
there
is
one
for
a
race-based
provision.
