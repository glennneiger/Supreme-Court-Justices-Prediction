justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question?
you
discuss
the
importance
of
remedying
past
wrongs,
which,
of
course,
is
discussed
a
great
deal
in
the
cases.
would
you
deny
the
possibility
that
in
the
total
absence
of
any
past
wrong
and
any
desire
to
remedy
anything
there
might
be
a
valid
interest
in
the
desirability
of
multi-ethnic
representation
on
a
teaching
faculty
which
they
cite
in
this
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it
would
at
least
be
arguable...
i
am
not
suggesting
an
answer...
that
that
kind
of
justification
might
suffice
in
the
absence
of
any
need
to
remedy
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
put
the
bakke
case
to
one
side
for
a
minute
and
talk
about
this
case.
why
would
it
not
be
a
permissible
objective
of
the
school
board
and
the
union
to
do
exactly
what
they
said
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
that
there
had
been
trouble
in
the
schools
and
they
thought
a
possible
solution
to
their
problems
would
be
some
diversity
of
the
faculty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
its
face
it
says
the
desirability
of
multi-ethnic
representation
on
the
teaching
faculty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
they
had
never
had
a
black
teacher
before.
you
suggest
the
means
are
excessive
and
maybe
you
are
right,
maybe
the
remedy
is
wrong.
just
kind
of
focus
separately
on
the
question
whether
the
objective
itself
might
in
some
circumstances
be
a
legitimate,
permissible
objective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
were
never
any
available,
so
they
didn't
do
it
wrongfully
in
any
sense,
they
just
didn't
happen
to
have
any.
i
just
want
to...
if
they
need
to
be
remedying
something
in
order
to
have
a
permissible
objective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
do
you
contend
that
was
an
impermissible
goal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
get
the
same
ratio
of
teachers
and
students?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
the
earlier
hiring
goal,
was
that
permissible
or
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
permissible
to
try
to
get
the
same
ratio
as
in
the
employment
market,
but
impermissible
to
get
the
same
ratio
as
in
the
student
body?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
why
one
is
permissible
and
the
other
is
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
a
remedy
for
the
benefit
of
any
victim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
nevertheless,
it
is
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
susskind,
can
i
ask
you
a
background
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
the
layoff
started...
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
went
on
for
a
period
of
several
years
where
the
people
were
hired
and
put
back
and
laid
off
again.
but,
at
the
beginning
of
the
problem
when
you
had
to
decrease
the
total
number
of
teachers,
what
is
the
maximum
seniority
of
the
people
who
were
laid
off?
how
seriously
did
you
affect
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
she
was
teaching
the
wrong
subject
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
