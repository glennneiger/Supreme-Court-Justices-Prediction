isn't
it
true
that
some
of
the
teachers
in
your
group
got
their
jobs
solely
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
prove
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
have
segregated
schools
in
jackson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
never
had
segregated
schools
in
jackson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
phrase
was
ever.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ever
have
segregated
schools
in
jackson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
did
you
look
that
up.
were
you
interested
in
finding
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
you
find
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
you
didn't
find
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
this
was
caused
by
a
contract,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
whole
problem
is
the
contract.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
the
union
is
80
percent
white.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
that
is
what
you
are
complaining
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
how
much
clout
20
have
over
<eighty>
[=
80]
percent.
i
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
that
clout.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
that
the
20
percent
of
the
union
should
not
have
the
rights
that
were
negotiated
by
that
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
tonstall
and
steele
back
in
the
40's.
that
is
when
that
was
determined,
that
a
union
and
employer
could
not--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--there
is
nothing
new
about
that,
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
this.
this
is
where
the
union
contract
was
carefully
negotiated
and
agreed
upon
and
you
want
to
upset
it.
