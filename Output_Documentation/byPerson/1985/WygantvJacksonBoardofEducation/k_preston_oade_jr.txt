mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
individual
petitioners
have
suffered
what
we
deem
to
be
constitutional
injury
by
being
laid
off
on
numerous
occasions
from
their
employment
as
tenured
public
school
teachers
with
the
jackson
school
district
in
jackson,
michigan.
the
eight
individual
tenured
teachers
have,
between
1976
and
the
present
time,
been
laid
off
on
a
number
of
occasions
from
periods
ranging
from
six
weeks
up
to
three
years
of
no
employment
for
petitioner
wendy
wygant.
deborah
brezezinski,
another
one
of
the
individual
petitioners,
has
been
laid
off
eight
times,
eight
separate
times,
during
the
past
nine
years.
the
reasons
for
these
layoffs
are
because
of
a
race-based
system
for
layoff
contained
in
a
labor
contract
between
their
employer
and
their
union.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
explicit
use
of
race
imposed
and
sponsored
by
the
state
itself,
the
local
school
board
being
an
agent
of
the
state,
being
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
michigan,
and
as
such
we
submit
that
it
must
be
justified
by
the
state
and
that
justification
must
be
of
the
most
compelling
nature.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
at
a
minimum
where
the
state
seeks
to
assign
job
benefits
and
burdens
based
upon
race
the
burden
is
upon
the
state
to
show
a
state
interest
that
has
some
remedial
character
and
we
say,
number
one,
the
state
must
identify
an
injury,
identify
a
constitutional
injury
that
must
be
remedied
at
the
expense
of
the
individual
petitioners.
we
say,
number
two,
the
state
must
show
that
the
instrument
or
device
or
means
chosen
to
remedy
that
identified
discrimination
are
properly
tailored
to
achieve
that
end
and
no
other
end.
number
three,
we
think
at
a
minimum
the
state
must
do
this
before,
not
after,
before
it
resorts
to
the
use
of
race
for
determining
job
benefits.
if
the
states
does
not
do
it
before
the
use
of
race
is
assigned
to
determine
job
rights,
how
are
the
courts
to
review
whether
the
use
of
race
is
a
permissible
constitutional
objective
and
responds
to
a
proper
remedial
purpose?
so,
the
justification
should
not
be
ad
hoc
or
ex
post
facto.
it
should
be
done
before
the
use
of
race
is
adopted.
now,
we
say
that
the
use
of
race
in
this
case
has
no
remedial
character
and
as
such
amounts
to
a
naked
racial
preference.
we
say
that
because--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
we
agree
with
that
and
we
think
that
as
a
predicate
for
properly
conceived
affirmative
action
that
is
exactly
what
any
employer
must
do.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
think
that
there
are
some
differences
between
affirmative
action
recruiting
and
what
an
employer
may
do
to
incumbent
employees.
we
think
to
take
two
public
employees,
one
white
and
one
black,
and
to
treat
them
differently
because
of
their
race
must,
as
i
have
said,
bear
a
most
extraordinary
justification.
and,
whether
or
not
such
a
justification
would
be
present
in
the
abstract,
i
guess,
is
what
your
question
goes
to.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
there
are,
for
example,
school
desegregation
cases
where
the
courts
have
found
that
in
order
to
remedy
on-going
constitutional
violations
in
segregated
school
districts
and
in
order
to
have
effective
desegregation
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
make
layoffs
by
race,
but
only
if
strictly
necessary
to
remedy
constitutional
violations.
and,
of
course,
there
are
no
such
constitutional
violations
in
this
case.
we
say
there
is
no
balancing
to
be
done.
individuals,
says
the
constitution,
have
a
right
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws.
if
there
is
some
injury
that
must
be
remedied
or
some
other
compelling
constitutional
value,
then
there
is
a
balancing
test
to
be
done,
but
in
this
case
before
the
court,
we
plead
in
the
complaint
in
the
lower
courts
in
paragraph
21
of
our
complaint
that...
and
i
quote,
"there
has
been
no
finding
of
past
employer
discrimination
in
the
hiring
of
teacher
personnel
on
the
part
of
the
jackson
school
board
by
a
governmental
agency
competent
to
rule
on
such
matters.
"
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
paragraph
21
of
the
complaint.
it
is
recited
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief
and
is
also
contained
in
our
original
brief,
justice
white.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
to
answer
your
question,
justice
stevens,
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
the
bakke
case
was
an
example
of
that.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
might
suffice,
but
again...
and,
i
think
in
the
bakke
case
there
was
a
first
amendment
interest
there
that
the
university
of
california
board
of
regents
had
in
an
ethnically
diverse
student
body.
but,
you
could
not
deprive
applicants
to
the
medical
school
of
equal
opportunity
to
achieve
that
objective.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
don't
think
the
achievement
of
this
aim
was
for
diversity
on
the
faculty.
we
go
right
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
on
its
face--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--but,
the
goal
that
that
is
aimed
at
is
proportional
representation,
justice
stevens,
between
the
population
of
minorities
in
the
student
body
and
the
teacher
population.
we
say
that
that
is
an
impermissible
constitutional
objective
if
you
can
only
get
there
by
depriving
tenured
teachers
of
employment
rights.
i
am
going
to
talk
about
why
that
is
an
impermissible
objective
and
why
in
this
case
it
is
an
unrealistic
and
unobtainable
objective.
i
don't
think
a
school
board
should
simply
be
able
to
say
we
desire
multi-ethnic
representation.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
jackson
school
board
has
multi-ethnic
representation.
the
jackson
school
board
has
consistently
hired
and
employed
minority
teachers
consistent
with
the
available
supply
of
qualified
minority
teachers.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
if
they
had
never
hired
a
black
teacher
and
did
not
have
any,
i
think
this
would
be
a
different
case
and
i
think--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
think,
first
of
all,
they
do
need
to
be
remedying
something.
i
think
there
it
has
to
have
some
remedial
character.
whenever
the
state
resorts
to
the
use
of
race
for
determining
job
rights,
it
must
have
a
remedial
character.
you
can't
deprive
one
individual
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
just
to
achieve
a
worthy
social
objective
that
the
school
board
may
think
is
worthy.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
say
that,
justice
white.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
hiring
case
and
we
certainly--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--we
think
in
the
absence
of
any
remedial
effort
and
the
absence
of
any
work
force
analysis
and
the
absence
of
any
under-utilization
of
minorities
in
the
work
force
and
in
the
absence
of
any
goals
and
timetables
or
standards,
yes,
that
would
be
impermissible
for
an
employer,
simply
for
the
sake
of
race,
to
prefer
one
individual
over
another
individual.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
are
saying
if--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
there
has
to
be
a
remedial
character
here.
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
discrimination.
i
don't
think--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
i
am
sorry
if
i
misspoke
myself.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
don't
think
so,
justice
powell.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
that
gets
to
whether...
even
if,
even
if
you
had
some
findings
of
discrimination
in
the
jackson
school
district
in
the
hiring
of
minority
teachers
which
are
not
present
here,
that
the
instrument
chosen
here
would
still
be
impermissible,
because,
number
one,
it
is
not
properly
tailored
to
remedy
that.
it
is
an
extremely
harsh
instrument.
you
are
talking
about
who
is
going
to
keep
their
job
and
you
are
talking
about
making
that
determination
on
the
color
of
one's
skin.
so,
we
think
even
if
there
were
findings.
but,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
here--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
we
reject
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
there
is
nothing
to
prove--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--we
think--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--we
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
the
record
goes
back
in
this
case
to
1953
and
we
know
one
thing
about
the
jackson
school
district
in
1953.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
can't
answer
that
question,
justice
marshall.
the
record
does
not
answer
that.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
was
very
interested
in
finding
out.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
have
data--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--the
answer
is
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
and,
i
did
not
find
it.
we
know
from
two
prior
decisions
in
two
related
cases
previous
to
this
one
which
we
refer
to
as
jackson
one
and
jackson
two,
that
there
is
no
discrimination
in
the
school
district
as
to
minority
hire.
we
know
that
from
a
federal
district
court
who
made
a
jurisdictional
finding
in
1976.
we
know
that
from
a
county
circuit
court
decision
in
1979
where
a
county
circuit
court
judge,
judge
britten,
examined
the
history
of
the
jackson
school
district,
examined
the
adoption
of
the
race-based
layoff
system
in
the
contract
which
we
challenge
here
today,
which
at
that
time
minority
teachers
were
suing
the
school
board
to
uphold
the
preference
contained
in
the
agreement
because
the
jackson
school
board
had
refused
to
follow
when
it
met
laying
off
tenured,
white,
experienced
teachers
and
retaining
inexperienced,
minority,
probationary
teachers.
that
happened
in
1974.
that
lead
to
the
lawsuits
in
jackson
one
and
jackson
two.
in
jackson
two,
the
county
circuit
court
found
that
there
is
no
history
of
overt
discrimination
by
the
parties
to
this
labor
contract.
now,
this
contract
was
adopted
in
1972.
let's
look
at
the
situation
in
the
jackson
school
district
when
this
contract
was
adopted.
justice
marshall
asked
did
we
have
segregated
schools
in
the
jackson
school
district.
certainly
not
in
'72.
this
school
district
over
a
period
of
time
had
made
an
on-going
effort
to
keep
up
with
changing
housing
patterns
and
had
redrawn
their
school
boundary
lines
and
built
new
schools
in
order
to
effectively
integrate
that
school
district
and
had
achieved
that
prior
to
the
time
that
this
contract
was
adopted
in
1972.
it
had
also
set
certain
minority
hiring
goals
in
that
school
district
and
those
minority
goals
are
discussed
in
our
brief
and
they
concern
the
fact
they
wanted
at
least
two
minority
teachers
in
each
of
the
small
elementary
schools
which
had
between
10
and
15
teachers
each.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
the
state's
obligation,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
came
forward
and
we
said
we
are
being
victimized
by
a
labor
contract
which
exhibits
on
its
face
an
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
and
we
have
suffered
a
constitutional
injury
because
of
it
and
it
is
the
state
that
must
come
forward
to
justify
it.
and,
obviously,
to
the
extent
there
is
no
compelling
justification
in
the
record,
the
state
loses.
i
simply
make
the
point
that
in
1972
the
hiring
goals
of
the
school
district
had
been
met.
it
was
a
healthy
situation.
you
had
the
same
number
of
minority
teachers
one
would
expect
to
find
given
non-discriminatory
hiring.
so,
this
contract
was
not
adopted
as
an
affirmative
action
hiring
or
recruitment
effort.
it
was
adopted
in
1972
in
order
to
do
one
thing,
to
achieve
proportional
representation
between
the
percentage
of
minorities
and
the
student
body
and
the
percentage
of
minority
faculty.
if
they
had
25
percent
minority
students,
they
wanted
25
percent
minority
teachers.
that
is
what
the
contract
says
and
i
quote:
"the
goal
of
such
policy
shall
be
to
have
at
least
the
same
percentage
of
minority
racial
representation
on
each
individual
staff
as
is
represented
by
the
student
population
of
the
jackson
public
schools.
"
this
contract
says
nothing
about
affirmative
action
hiring
goals.
it
says
nothing
about
the
availability
of
minority
teachers,
the
supply,
if
you
will,
who
are
out
there
to
be
hired.
it
says
nothing--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
we
say
and
we
quote,
justice
powell,
from
bakke.
a
proportional
representation
is
an
impermissible
constitutional
objective
and
constitutes
discrimination.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
a
hiring
goal,
we
think,
may
be
permissible
if
you
have
some
finding
or
determination
of--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
one
has
a
remedial
character,
justice
stevens.
if,
in
fact,
you
have
some
determination
that
there
is
a
shortfall
of
minority
teachers
relative
to
the
supply,
and
if
that
is
statistically
significant
enough
that
we
know
it
didn't
happen
by
accident,
then--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
it
is
not,
and
that
issue--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it
would
have
to
be
victim-specific.
certainly
there
are
no
findings,
victim-specific
or
otherwise.
and,
we
think
the
very
reason
this
case
is
before
this
court
is
because
you
do
not
have
findings
of
discrimination,
either
on
an
individual
basis
or
on
a
group
basis.
getting
back
to
the
labor
contract,
the
contract
says
nothing
about
hiring
goals
or
timetables.
it
says
nothing
about
the
school
district's
employment
practices
or
procedures.
what
the
contract
is
designed
to
do
is
achieve
this
racial
balance
and
what
article
xii
is
designed
to
do,
as
put
by
the
district
court,
and
again
i
quote...
article
xii,
to
be
clear,
is
the
contract
provision
that
assigns
layoffs
on
the
basis
of
race.
based
on
the
district
court's
findings
which
are
on
page
32a
of
our
appendix
to
the
petition,
"the
plan
is
designed
to
either,
one,
retain
a
sufficient
number
of
minority
teachers
so
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
jackson
school
district
faculty
will
roughly
approximate
that
of
the
student
body;
or,
two,
if
that
ratio
has
not
yet
been
achieved,
then
at
least
to
prevent
a
reduction
in
the
minority
to
majority
ratio.
"
so,
what
we
have
is
a
racial
preference
designed
to
achieve
a
racial
balance
and
a
prohibition
against
laying
off
minority
teachers
if
that
would
reduce
the
existing
percentage.
why
is
that
an
impermissible
objective,
which
justice
stevens
has
inquired
previously.
it
is
impermissible
because
there
is
no
causal
nexus
or
relationship
between
the
percentage
of
minorities
in
the
student
body
or
the
percentage
of
minority
teachers.
they
are
subject
to
totally
different
influences.
there
are
any
number
of
reasons
why
you
might
have
a
certain
percentage
of
minorities
in
the
student
population.
it
might
reflect
change
in
birth
rates,
it
might
reflect
housing
habits,
it
might
reflect
racial
demographics,
it
might
reflect
parent
choice,
it
might
reflect
population
movement.
any
number
of
reasons
can
increase
or
decrease
the
percentage
of
minority
students
in
a
school
district.
now,
let's
look
at
the
percentage
of
minority
teachers.
what
influences
the
percentage
of
minority
teachers
in
a
school
district?
the
first
and
most
important
thing
that
influences
the
percentage
is
the
supply.
what
is
the
available
supply
of
minority
teachers
who
are
available
to
be
hired
by
any
school
district?
taking
the
number,
the
most
recent
data
we
have,
we
know
that
in
1979
and
1980
all
michigan
colleges
and
universities
graduated
a
certain
percentage
of
minorities
with
education
degrees,
whether
it
is
a
bachelor's,
whether
it
is
a
master's,
whether
it
is
a
ph.
d,
and
assuming
that
every
minority
that
gets
an
education
degree
wants
to
go
into
teaching,
we
know
that
the
available
supply
of
minority
teachers
is
at
most
11
percent.
the
school
district
cannot
be
expect
to
hire
and
retain
more
minority
teachers
than
are
available
out
there.
yet
they
have
an
objective
that
says
we
have
27
percent
minority
students,
we
want
27
percent
minority
teachers,
and
until
we
get
it
we
are
going
to
deprive
other
tenured
teachers
of
their
civil
rights
in
order
to
get
there.
that
is
why
it
is
an
impermissible
constitutional
objective.
and,
again--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--well,
again,
i
am
reluctant
to
answer
questions
on
hiring
because
we
say
this
is
not
a
hiring
case.
this
layoff
provision
is
not
even
designed
to--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
think
to
answer
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
i
can
tell
you
what
the
practice
is
in
this
country
today.
whether
it
is
under
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance,
or
whether
it
is
under
the
eeoc
guidelines,
every
fortune
500
company
in
this
country
hires
according
to
race.
they
all
do
it.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
we
think...
well,
the
constitution,
of
course,
does
not
govern
the
private
sector.
they
do
that,
however--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
they
do
that
under
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance...
the
regulations,
and
it
is
41
cfr,
part
60,
tells
these
employers
you
must
have
an
utilization
analysis.
in
other
words,
you
must
look
at
your
work
force.
you
must
see
if
your
supply
of
black
engineers
is
equivalent
to
the
number
of
black
engineers
you
could
hire
given
the
supply
available.
and,
if
there
is
a
disparity
in
your
work
force
and
if
it
is
a
significant
disparity,
then
you
must
adopt
goals
and
timetables.
and,
employers
do
that
and
they
hire
according
to
race
to
reach
those
goals
and
objectives.
this
plan
before
this
court
could
not
meet
the
standard
in
the
private
sector
under
the
ofccp.
why
not?
it
uses
race
to
determine
and
assign
job
rights
without
any
utilization
analysis
of
its
work
force,
without
any
determination
that
they
are
not
hiring
or
retaining
minorities
according
to
the
available
supply,
without
any
goals
and
timetables
to
place
some
kind
of
appropriate
limit
on
what
is
being
done
here.
so,
to
answer
your
question,
we
can
say
what
is
being
done
in
the
private
sector
under
ofccp,
and,
ostensibly,
under
this
court's
holding
in
the
weber
case.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
is
in
a
labor
agreement
between
the
petitioners'
employer
and
their
union,
justice
marshall.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
that
is
correct
more
or
less.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
don't
think
you
should
look
at
the
race
of
a
union.
we
think
you
should
look
at
whether
or
not
people
are
voting
their
economic
self-interest.
that
is
what
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
all
about.
and,
to
say
that
this...
or
suggest
that
this
is
somehow
proper
because
the
majority
of
the
union
members
voted
to
ratify
it
after
it
was
put
in
there
without
their
knowledge,
to
suggest
it
is
constitutional
for
that
reason,
we
reject
that
suggestion.
we
say
that
the
united
state
constitution
guarantees
individuals
equal
rights
under
law
and
the
constitutional
guarantee
does
not
depend
on
whether
one
has
enough
clout
to
negotiate
for
it
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
they
have
no
clout
to
protect
their
individual
rights,
justice
marshall,
and
that
is
why
we
are
before
this
court.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
saying
that--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no.
i
am
saying
that
regardless
of
what
the
employer
and
the
union
do,
regardless
of
what
they
do,
justice
marshall,
the
constitution
says
you
shall
have
equal
protection
under
law.
the
collective
bargaining
process
is
not
competent
to
determine
someone's
constitutional
rights
and
we
think
that
is
simply
a
given.
we
would
cite
to
the
court
the
case
of
alexander
versus
gardner-denver,
which
is
a
1974
decision
of
this
court,
which
i
believe
is
415
u.s.
36.
that
was
a
title
vii
case
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
can
a
union
and
an
employer
weigh
an
employee's
title
vii
rights.
of
course,
that
can't
weigh
it.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
you
are
correct,
justice
marshall,
thank
you.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
justice
marshall,
first
of
all,
we
want
to
upset
it
because
it
is
unconstitutional
and
it
deprives
the
petitioners
before
this
court
of
their
constitutional
rights
and
we
object
to
any
characterization
that
this
was
carefully
negotiated.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
that
is
correct.
even
if
the
process
was
entirely
good
and
you
had
an
entirely
above-board
process
by
which
this
was
arrived,
it
still
violates
the
constitution.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
thank
you.
