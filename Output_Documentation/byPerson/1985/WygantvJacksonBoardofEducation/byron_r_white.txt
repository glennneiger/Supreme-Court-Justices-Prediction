what
are
you

you
would
say
then
that
if
there
were
two
people...
they
had
a
vacancy
and
there
were
two
applicants,
a
white
and
a
black
person,
you
would
say
the
state
could
not
choose
the
black
just
to
increase
the
number
of
blacks
on
the
faculty
absent
some
proof
of
discrimination
in
the
past?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
seem
to.
justice
byron

white
why
would
the
hiring
case
be
different
if
the
reason
one
person
is
hired
and
the
other
person
is
turned
down
is
a
racial
reason
and
there
is
no
proof
of
past
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
would
say
if
the
school
board
just
thought
the
blacks
were
under-represented
that
the
preference
for
the
black
would
be
quite
all
right
as
a
hiring
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
had
been
no
constitutional
violation
in
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
my
example
the
state
could
not
do
that
absent
some
proof
of
some
past
discrimination
that
had
to
be
remedied.
justice
byron
r.
white
merit
isn't
involved,
but
race
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
these
layoffs.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
weren't,
i
wouldn't
think.
