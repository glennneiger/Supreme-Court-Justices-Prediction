justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
just
for
a
minute.
the
discussion
for
the
last
three
or
four
minutes
has
omitted
entirely
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
reverse
discrimination
against
whites.
in
other
words,
people
are
laid
off.
suppose
you
did
have
some
decision
below
that
there
had
been
discrimination
in
the
past.
would
that
justify
the
laying
off
of
people
to
make
room
for
the
employment
of
others?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
has
not
been
mentioned
in
the
recent
discussion.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
susskind,
before
you
proceed,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
board
in
1972
knew
it
had
been
discriminating
against
minority
teachers?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
it
take
that
position
in
the
litigation
before
the
district
court
in
the
first
case?
it
denied
it
at
that
time.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
did
deny
in
that
case
it
had
discriminated?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
same
parties
as
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
discrimination
issue
wasn't
different,
was
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
whatever
the
issue
the
board
claimed
it
had
not
discriminated.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
while
i
am
interrupting
you,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
has
there
ever
been
any
judicial
decision
of
discrimination
by
the
board?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
has
there
ever
been
any
judicial
decision?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
answer
with
respect
to
this
board
is
no,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
there
has
been
no
judicial
determination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you
what
may
be
a
frivolous
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
was
interested
in
the
fact
that
minorities
described
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
include
blacks,
american
indians,
orientals,
or
persons
of
spanish
decendency.
how
in
the
world
would
you
determine
who
is
a
person
of
spanish
decendency?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
pardon
me?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
will
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
asian
students
think
that
american
indians
would
be
a
role
model?
