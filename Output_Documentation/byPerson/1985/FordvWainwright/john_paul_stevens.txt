mr.
burr,
can
i
ask
you
what
in
your
view
the
test
of
incompetence
is
for
this
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it's
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burr,
would
you
agree
that
the
threshold
ought
to
be
directed
at
one
or
more
of
those
three
components
of
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
three
you
gave
me.
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient,
for
example,
just
to
prove
some
form
of
mental
illness
which
did
not
necessarily
relate
to
one
of
these
three
components?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you,
if
i
may,
with
that
one.
are
you
saying
that
even
if
there
were
no
opportunity...
i
know
you
say
in
this
case
he
had
plenty
of
opportunity.
but
even
if
the
particular
convicted
person
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
for
death,
whatever
might
be
appropriate
in
his
case,
that
still
should
not
matter
because
of
what
he
did
to
the
victim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
at
the
time
of
imposing
the
sentence
he
fully
understands,
but
then
a
month
later
he
loses
the
capacity
to
prepare
for
death.
are
you
saying
that
that
should
not
prevent
the
state
from
going
forward
with
the
execution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
