mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
of
alvin
ford
is
before
you
today
on
a
record
which
raises
grave
questions
about
mr.
ford's
competence
to
be
executed,
notwithstanding
the
governor's
determination
in
florida
that
mr.
ford
is
competent.
the
record
shows
a
gradual,
unrelenting
deterioration
of
mr.
ford's
mental
health
from
late
december
1981
to
the
present.
the
record
shows
that
by
1982
mr.
ford
was
diagnosed
as
suffering
from
paranoid
schizophrenia
by
a
psychiatrist
familiar
with
his
medical
history.
yet,
this
psychiatrist's
recommendation
for
therapy
and
medication
was
ignored
by
prison
staff.
the
record
further
shows
that
by
late
1983,
when
mr.
ford's
deterioration
began
to
compromise
his
competence
to
be
executed,
he
was
examined
by
three
psychiatrists
appointed
by
the
governor
of
florida
and
by
a
fourth
psychiatrist
at
the
request
of
defense
counsel.
three
of
these
psychiatrists
agreed
that
mr.
ford
suffered
from
psychosis
or
paranoid
schizophrenia.
the
record
shows
that,
despite
this
substantial
agreement
on
medical
diagnosis,
the
governor's
psychiatrists
disagreed
with
the
defense
psychiatrist
concerning
the
legal
consequences
as
to
mr.
ford's
competency
of
his
medical
condition.
finally,
the
record
shows
that
in
determining
mr.
ford's
competence
to
be
executed,
the
florida
governor
held
no
hearing
of
any
kind
to
sort
out
which
of
the
conflicting
psychiatric
opinions
was
more
reliable.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
the
governor
may
not
have
even
considered
the
opinion
and
reasoning
of
the
defense
psychiatrist
who
found
that
mr.
ford
was
incompetent
to
be
executed.
these
deficiencies
in
the
governor's
competency
determination
process
created,
we
submit,
a
grave
risk
that
the
decision
that
mr.
ford
was
competent
was
erroneous.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
the
statutory
procedure,
we
submit,
does
not
provide
a
sufficiently
reliable
process
for
the
determination
of
competence.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
if
all
the
psychiatrists
had
agreed
that
mr.
ford
was
competent,
i
think
there
would
be
no
issue.
we
would
certainly
agree--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
would
have
to
be
some
threshold
showing
of
incompetency,
similar
to
a
threshold
showing
of
incompetency
before
trial,
for
example.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
if
there
is
a
threshold
showing
of
incompetency,
then
whatever
procedure
follows
that
results
in
all
expert
opinion
being
unanimous,
then
the
procedure
would
likely
be
at
an
end,
because
there'd
be
no
issue
to
litigate.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--in
a
case
where
competency
is
seriously
in
question,
this
procedure
we
submit
is
inadequate.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
that's
right,
we
submit
that
there
are
two
legs
upon
which
this
issue
stands.
one
is
certainly
the
state-created
interest
in
being
spared
from
execution
when
incompetent.
the
other
is
that
as
a
matter
of
eighth
amendment
substantive
law
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
to
execute
those
who
are
incompetent
at
the
time
of
execution.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
think
the
question
would
have
to
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
nature
of
the
punishment.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
it
could
be,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
incompetency
and
the
nature
of
the
sentence.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
alternative
would
not
be
release
from
prison.
the
sentence
would
still
be
there
to
be
served,
but
the
person
would
probably
be
treated
in
some
mental
health
facility.
it
could
be
a
forensic
mental
health
facility.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
requires
a
blending
both
of
historical
analysis
and
of
modern
day
analysis.
historically,
from
as
far
back
as
we've
been
able
to
trace
it,
at
least
to
the
thirteenth
century,
the
common
law
has
flatly
prohibited
the
execution
of
the
incompetent.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
that's
certainly
true.
but
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
developed
in
the
last
two
or
three
decades,
the
question
of
procedure
and
right
are
two
separate
questions.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
solesbee
in
my
view
treated
the
issue
from
the
perspective
of
procedure.
the
court
asked,
what
is
the
way
that
this
interest
has
been
protected.
the
court
likened
the
protection
of
this
interest
to
clemency,
which
was
a
wholly
discretionary
process
in
which
various
reasons
for
mercy
could
be
submitted
by
a
condemned
person,
and
the
governor
or
other
clemency
authority
said
yes
or
no,
depending
wholly
on
that
party's
discretion.
so
from
that
perspective,
the
court
did
i
believe
begin
with
the
question
of
how
is
this
enforced
and
get
to
the
question
of
it's
not
an
enforceable
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
no,
not
per
se.
certainly
governors
are
deemed
appropriate
and
highly
appropriate
decision
makers
as
to
clemency
questions.
as
to
this
question,
which
we
submit
is
a
rights
question
and
not
a
discretionary
mercy
sort
of
question,
the
governor
may
be
an
appropriate
decision
maker,
depending
in
part
on
the
source
of
the
right.
be
would
probably
not
be
an
appropriate
decision
maker
ultimately
for
an
eighth
amendment
right.
but
for
the
state-created
right,
the
governor,
assuming
he
acts
with
impartiality
and
detachment,
could
be
an
appropriate
decision
maker.
there
could
be
practical
problems
from
a
prejudgment
perspective,
because
the
governor
may
in
a
clemency
proceeding
have
already
passed
on
a
question
of
mental
status.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
if
as
a
matter
of
due
process
law
some
minimal
due
process
requirements
were
required,
whether
a
particular
competency
determination
was
made
in
accord
with
those
requirements
would,
i
believe,
be
an
appropriate
matter
for
federal
review
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
is.
again,
whether
the
source
of
the
right
is
the
eighth
amendment
or
florida's
state-created
right
to
be
spared
from
execution
when
incompetent,
we
submit
that
the
constitution
requires
a
reliable
decision
making
process
under
either
route.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
again,
i
think
if
that
were
the
only
procedure,
if
those
five
psychiatrists
were
in
the
course
of
making
that
decision
required
to
examine
the
person
and
then
decide
among
themselves
by
whatever
method
they
choose
whether
the
person
is
competent
or
incompetent,
i
don't
think
that
would
stand
up
under
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
your
honor,
again
it
depends
on
the
role
assigned.
if
those
psychiatrists
are
the
decision
makers,
then--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--if
they
are
the
decision
makers
and
there
is
a
case
where
there
is
differing
psychiatric
opinion,
not
necessarily
among
those
five--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
certainly,
certainly.
but
this
court
has
long
recognized
where
psychiatrists
do
differ
as
to
forensic
mental
health
issues,
the
only
reliable
way
for
resolving
that
difference
is
through
an
adversarial
process,
where
the
competing
views
of
psychiatrists
are
laid
before
a
fact
finder
and
the
more
reliable
of
those
competing
views
can
be
decided
by
a
neutral
fact
finder.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
could
do
that.
but
the
risk
of
error,
i
submit,
in
a
decision
which
has
life
or
death
consequences
could
not
be
satisfied
by
an
ex
parte
process
simply
among
those
five
psychiatrists.
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
serious
dispute
as
to
competency,
i
submit
that's
the
threshold.
certainly
in
a
case
where
there
was
agreement
as
to
incompetency
or
incompetency...
or
competency--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--where
there
is
a
dispute--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
five
commissioners
among
themselves
can
resolve
that
dispute
without
some
input
from--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--certainly,
after
having
heard
presentations
from
both
sides
of
an
issue.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
your
honor,
what
we
are
arguing
about
is,
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
dispute
about
competency,
the
only
fair
and
reliable
way
to
resolve
that
dispute
is
through
an
adversarial
process,
at
the
end
of
which
psychiatrists
may
well
be
the
deciders.
but
the
only
way
to
have
a
disputed
question
of
mental
health
and
competency
resolved,
only
reliable
way,
is
through
an
adversarial
presentation,
to
whomever
the
decision
maker
may
be.
simply
entrusting
those
decision
makers
to
themselves
is
not--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
the
fact
finders
could
be
psychiatrists.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
a
critical
component
would
be
an
oral
adversarial
hearing,
for
this
reason.
again,
through
a
long
line
of
decisions
the
court
has
taken
the
opportunity
to
look
at
the
way
mental
health
issues
are
resolved,
both
in
the
criminal
context
and
in
the
civil
commitment
type
context.
and
in
each
of
those
decisions,
where
the
state
takes
involuntary
action
against
a
person
who
may
be
mentally
ill,
if
mental
illness
is
either
a
factual
predicate
for
the
state's
action
or
a
defense
against
the
state's
action,
the
court
has
said
that
there
has
to
be
the
adversarial
crucible
in
which
to
make
a
reliable
decision.
now,
that,
as
i
understand
the
court's
decisions,
requires
a
couple
of
critical
components
that
can't
be
taken
care
of
on
paper:
the
right
to
present
evidence
and
to
have
it
understood
through
questioning
by
the
fact
finder;
and
the
right
to
cross-examine
adverse
evidence,
and
again
with
the
notion
of
assisting
the
fact
finder
to
make
the
most
reliable
decision.
so
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
an
oral
adversarial
hearing.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
again,
i
think
the
test
would
depend
upon
the
source
of
the
right.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
if
the
test
is
the
eighth
amendment,
we
have
proposed
a
test
that
we
believe
follows
the
contours
of
the
eighth
amendment
reasons
for
the
right
in
the
first
place.
basically,
there
would
be
three
components:
the
first
would
be
similar
to
the
florida
test,
whether
the
person
understands
the
nature
and
effect
of
the
death
sentence
and
why
it's
being
imposed.
secondly,
whether
the
person
has
the
capacity
to
appreciate
the
termination
of
his
or
her
life,
which
is
different
from
the
first
test.
and
the
third
part
of
the
standard
would
be
based
on
an
access
to
courts
concern,
and
that
is
whether
the
person
has
sufficient
capacity
to
know
any
facts
which
might
cause
his
conviction
or
sentence
to
be
reversed
and
the
ability
to
communicate
it
to
counsel.
so
we
would
submit
that
the
eighth
amendment
interest
would
span...
eighth
amendment
test
would
span
all
three
of
those
interests.
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
four
concerns
which
i
think
the
need
for
a
reliable
procedure
raises.
the
first
i
have
already
addressed
briefly,
and
that
is
the
need
for
a
threshold
showing
of
incompetency
before
any
plenary
procedure,
however
it
be
defined,
can
be
invoked.
we
certainly
concede
that
some
threshold
showing
should
be
required.
that
kind
of
threshold
has
been
required
in
other
contexts,
such
as
incompetency
to
stand
trial,
in
which
the
threshold
was
articulated
in
drope
versus
missouri.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
of
the
drope
components?
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
think
the
showing
as
to
the
relationship
with
the
component
would
certainly
not
have
to
be
as
strong
as
after
a
full
proceeding.
taking
trial
competency
as
an
example,
in
drope
the
court
isolated
three
factors
that
were
material
to
the
threshold
determination:
evidence
of
irrational
behavior,
which
i
suppose
might
or
might
not
be
related
to
the
dusky
test
of
competency;
the
defendant's
demeanor
at
trial
or
pretrial
proceedings;
and
prior
medical
opinion
as
to
competency
to
stand
trial.
now,
the
court,
as
i
read
drope
and
its
progeny,
certainly
left
latitude
for
one
of
these
factors
to
be
a
sufficient
threshold
if
it
was
strong
enough.
and
i
suppose
if
the
person,
again
in
a
trial
competency
context,
were
so
irrational
that
it
was
quite
clear
that
that
person
had
no
capacity
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
to
assist
counsel,
even
though
there
was
no
explicit
logical
relationship,
that
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
threshold.
so
i
think
if
you
had
that
kind
of
profound
mental
illness,
that
would
be
sufficient,
just
as
it
would
in
a
trial
competency
context.
but
generally
speaking,
you
would
want
to
have
that
threshold
relate
to
the
test
of
competency.
otherwise,
you
may
be
going
through
a
proceeding
that
at
the
end
of
which
you
find
out
was
immaterial.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
justice
rehnquist,
there's
certainly
no
explicit
requirement--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--in
the
eighth
amendment.
i
think
again
this
whole
eighth
amendment
question
has
to
be
addressed
with
a
real
feel
for
the
historic
prohibition,
as
well
as
the
modern
day
analysis.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
there
were
a
number
of
rationales
given.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
historically,
the
thinking
was
that
madness
was
punishment
itself.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
i
think
there's
a
common
thread
through
all
of
the
common
law
reasons
which
is
certainly
relevant
today,
and
that
is
that
the
concern
for
a
functioning
human
intellect
in
a
person
being
punished
was
a
great
concern.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
to
that
extent,
that's
true.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
making
peace
with
god
is
simply
a
form
of
expressing
the
capacity
to
appreciate
the
termination
of
life.
making
peace
with
god
was
the
language
used
back
in
the
middle
ages,
and
for
some
people
that's
certainly
equally
important
today.
the
capacity
that
we're
talking
about,
though,
is
not
a
capacity
for
religion,
but
rather
the
capacity
that
all
human
beings
have
when
they
know
that
their
death
is
imminent
to
come
to
terms
with
dying,
rather
than
to
be
completely
terrorized
by
death,
to
ameliorate
that
terror
by
an
understanding
of
the
life
that
person
has
lived
and
the
death
that's
about
to
come.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
don't
think
so,
justice
marshall,
because
i
did
say
that
it's
the
capacity
to
come
to
terms
with
death,
not
the
capacity
to
make
peace
with
god
per
se.
certainly
people
who
are
religious
may
express
it
in
that
way,
but
those
who
are
not
religious
nonetheless
have
to
face
up
to
the
terror
of
death
itself.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
as
best
we
can
determine,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
back
in
the
middle
ages?
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
well,
i
think,
as
i
understand
the
medical
literature
and
the
research
that
has
been
done
on
death
and
dying,
the
medical
profession
understands
now
that
there
is
an
ameliorative
psychiatrical
process
that
seems
to
be
common
to
being
a
human
being,
that
people
go
through
in
different
ways
when
their
death
is
imminent.
i
think
there
was
an
intuitive
grasp
of
that
back
in
the
middle
ages,
when
people
spoke
about
the
need
to
make
peace
with
god.
but
i
think
that
has
been
secularly
understood
as
a
common
and
universal
psychiatrical
process
in
the
twentieth
century.
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
not
only
the
threshold
that
we
submit
must
be
met,
but
how
the
determination
itself,
again
whether
the
right
is
from
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
state-created
right,
why
the
constitution
requires
that
there
be
a
more
reliable
determination
of
competency
than
was
present
here.
there
are
two
reasons
for
this.
the
first
i
submit
is
found
in
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
over
the
last
decade
and
a
half,
since
the
furman
decision.
since
furman,
the
court
has
clearly
articulated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that,
because
the
taking
of
a
person's
life
by
the
state
is
qualitatively
different
in
its
severity
and
irrevocability
than
any
other
form
of
punishment,
the
decision
to
take
life
must
be
correspondingly
more
reliable.
and
the
court
has
assured
that
there
is
this
kind
of
greater
reliability
by
requiring
that
the
decision
maker
take
into
account
all
of
the
reasons
proffered
for
not
taking
someone's
life.
now,
obviously
there
are
some
clear
differences
between
the
decision
to
impose
the
death
sentence
at
the
outset
and
the
decision
to
carry
out
a
death
sentence
against
a
person
who
may
be
incompetent.
but
there's
a
very
fundamental
commonality
between
those
decisions
as
well,
because
in
both
instances
what's
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
life
will
be
taken.
and
the
irrevocability
of
that
decision
certainly
informs
the
need
for
reliability
as
to
the
competency
determination,
just
as
much
as
it
informs
the
need
for
a
reliable
sentencing
decision
at
the
outset.
likewise,
the
procedural
assurance
of
reliability,
that
the
decision
maker
take
into
account
all
of
the
countervailing
reasons
for
taking
life,
should
be
applicable
to
the
competency
decision.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
florida
procedure
does
not
allow
that.
the
florida
procedure
for
determining
competency
does
not
require
the
decision
maker
to
take
into
account
the
evidence
indicating
the
person
is
incompetent
if
the
source
of
that
evidence
falls
outside
of
the
three
psychiatrists
appointed
by
the
governor.
it's
that
need
for
reliability
that
the
taking
of
life
in
this
context
requires
that
we
find
in
the
eighth
amendment.
the
second
ground
is
simply
from
the
due
process
clause
itself.
for
more
than
100
years,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
any
party
adversely
affected,
to
be
adversely
affected
by
state
action,
has
a
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
state's
action.
that's
not
simply
a
matter
of
being
fair,
although
it
certainly
is
that.
but
it's
also
a
matter
of
wanting
state
actions
to
be
reliable,
because
we,
for
better
than
100
years,
for
200
years,
have
entrusted
an
adversarial
process
as
getting
us
more
reliable
decisions.
it's
that
reliability
which
the
court
has
drawn
on
time
and
time
again
in
the
mental
health
forensic
cases.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
we
concede
that
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
death
as
a
punishment
is
settled
and
is
settled
in
mr.
ford's
case.
but
at
this
point
there
is
still
a
question
as
to
whether
that
sentence
is
appropriately
carried
out
at
this
moment.
and
if
there
is
a
right
from
either
source
to
be
spared
from
execution
when
incompetent,
then
the
question
of
whether
life
is
to
be
taken
now
is
a
question
that
has
to
be
reliable--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--historically
and
in
most
of
the
states
that
have
this
rule,
the
rule
is
the
latter,
that
the
execution
is
postponed
until
and
if
the
person
regains
competency.
so
it
would
not
be
a
question
that
affected
the
sentence
in
a
jurisdictional
sense.
the
sentence
would
still
be
there,
but
not
to
be
carried
out
until
competency
is
regained.
i'd
like
to
take
just
one
minute
to
address
a
final
concern
that
i
think
this
case
raises,
and
that's
the
question
of
the
need
for
finality.
there's
no
question
that
in
this
court's
opinions
and
in
the
country
now
there
is
a
great
concern
about
finality
in
death
cases.
this
court
has
always
been
careful,
however,
to
balance
the
need
for
finality
against
the
need
for
a
reliable
decision
making
when
death
is
at
issue.
in
the
context
of
this
issue,
if
there
is
a
constitutionally
reliable
decision
making
process
at
the
outset
finality
will
be
possible
to
achieve.
it
can
be
done
in
this
way.
if
there's
a
reliable
determination
process
upon
a
raising
of
a
claim
of
incompetency,
there
will
be
reliable
fact
finding
concerning
the
person's
mental
state,
concerning
the
person's
history,
medical
history
and
clinical
background,
and
there
will
be
a
forward-looking
decision
made
as
to
whether
the
person
is
now
competent
or
may
be
incompetent
in
the
future.
if
future
claims
of
incompetency
were
to
be
made,
those
claims
would
necessarily
be
new
claims
because
they'd
have
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
changed
circumstances.
but
the
specter
of
endless
litigation
which
the
state
has
raised
is
really
not
a
specter
at
all
if
there's
a
reliable
process
in
the
beginning,
because--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--i
sound
like
a
broken
record,
but
again
i
think
it
depends
on
the
source
of
the
right.
if
the
source
is
the
eighth
amendment,
then
i
think
the
habeas
process
would
follow.
but
if
it's
a
state-created
right--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--i
think
that's
a
tough
question.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
certainly.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i
will
try
to
do
that.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
not
easily
answered.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
this
court
in
non-capital
cases,
criminal
cases,
has
never
required
appellate
review.
if
there
is
appellate
review,
then
it
has
to
be
fairly
done.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
certainly.
i
thought
the
question
was
should
there
be
appellate
review.
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
if
the
procedure--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--i
think
the
due
process
clause
would
require
a
judicial
review
of
that
action.
the
reasons
are
this.
in
pulley
versus
harris,
the
court
held--
mr.
richard
h.
burr,
iii
--not
necessarily,
because
i
think
any
form
of
judicial
review
after
a
fair
administrative
proceeding
can
be
limited.
it
can
be
limited
to
whether
fact
findings,
for
example,
are
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
and
need
not
be
a
plenary
kind
of
review
that
there
would
be
after
a
judicial
proceeding.
but
i
do
believe
the
underlying
eighth
amendment
concern
for
reliability
would
call
for
some
form
of
review,
just
as
in
the
death
sentencing
context
in
pulley
the
court
indicated
the
eighth
amendment
required
some
form
of
meaningful
appellate
review.
thank
you.
