justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burr,
this
court
has
never
held
that
it's
required
that
a
defendant
be
found
competent
before
he
can
be
executed,
has
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
contend
that
it
isn't
just
the
florida
statute,
though;
that
there's
a
requirement
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
says
that
one
must
be
competent
to
be
executed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
cruel
and
unusual
to
imprison
someone
who
is
incompetent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
could
be
in
some
circumstances
cruel
and
unusual
to
imprison
someone
who
is
incompetent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
would
then
have
a
right
to
be
released
from
prison,
i
take
it,
if
he
could
show
he
were
incompetent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
cruel
and
unusual
to
execute
someone
who
is
incompetent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
never
provided
for
any
sort
of
a
judicial
hearing.
granted,
there
are
statements
in
the
commentaries,
but
they
never
suggest
there
was
any
court
proceeding
for
a
determination
of
competence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
inexorably.
certainly
solesbee
against
balkcom
didn't
treat
it
that
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
eighth
amendment
require
the
person
appreciate
the
potential
termination
of
his
life?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that's
quite
obvious.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
historic
prohibition
really
comes
out
to
be
making
peace
with
your
maker,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
other
ones
sufficed
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that's
an
adequate
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
doesn't
that
apply
equally
to
anyone
being
sent
to
prison?
the
only
thing
that
separates
capital
punishment
from
imprisonment
is
making
peace
with
your
god,
really.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
doesn't
that
involve
entanglement
under
the
first
amendment?
