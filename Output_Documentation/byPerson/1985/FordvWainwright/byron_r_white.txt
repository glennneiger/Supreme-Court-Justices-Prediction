justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
all
the
psychiatrists
had
agreed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
this
procedure,
this
provision,
is
invalid
on
its
face.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
there
is
a
threshold
showing,
but
then
all
the
psychiatrists
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
just
a
question
of
the
application
of
this
procedure
in
any
particular
case
that
you're--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
triggers
any
kind
of
constitutional
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
do
you
believe
that
the
decision,
by
whomever
it
is
made,
should
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
must
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
you're
saying...
you're
asking
us
to
say
what's
wrong
with
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--procedure,
and
so
you
should
be
able
to
say
what
you
think
the
right
procedure
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
it
the
hard
way,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
we've
at
least
required
that
there
be
a
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
said
just
judicial
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
governor
went
here
had
had
an
adversary
hearing,
you
could
call
all
the
witnesses
you
wanted,
make
all
the
arguments
you
wanted,
and
then
he
decided
the
facts?
do
you
think
the
due
process
clause
would
require
a
judicial
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state
might
as
well
just
quit
wasting
its
time
and
provide
for
this
hearing
before
a
judge
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
contrary
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
not
one
of
the
commissioners?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
did
have
a...
they
were
allowed
to
submit
that
evidence
from
their
independent
psychiatrist?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask,
suppose
florida
had
no
provision
at
all
for
determining
whether
a
person
were
competent
to
be
executed,
and
the
law
of
florida
was
that
once
you're
convicted,
the
fact
that
you
become
incompetent
and
don't
know
what's
going
on
doesn't
make
any
difference,
we'll
still
execute
you.
would
there
be
any
constitutional
barrier
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you.
do
you
think
the
federal
constitution
would
require
that
florida
first
determine
whether
he's
competent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
florida
could
just
say,
we
intend
to
execute
people
who
become
incompetent
after
they
are
sentenced
to
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
that's
your
position?
