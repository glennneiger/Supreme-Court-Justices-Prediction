mr.
burr,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
going
at
is
to
tell
us
that
the
florida
statute
which
prescribes
the
method
for
dealing
with
this
problem
is
invalid,
is
that
it?
or
is
it
the
way
in
which
they
applied
the
statute?
which
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it
must
be
an
adversary
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
violates
any
constitutional
provision
for
a
state
legislature
to
vest
in
the
governor
authority
to
act
on
the
sentence
and
to
set
it
aside?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
condition
that
on
his
acting
impartially,
as
you
just
said.
who
would
review
the
governor
to
decide
whether
he
acted
with
impartiality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
said
if
it's
required.
in
your
view,
are
you
telling
us
it
is
required?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
concept
that
you've
been
discussing
really
antedates
the
middle
ages
and
the
medieval
period,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
the
psychiatrists
come
to
terms
with
that,
or
do
they
accept
the
medieval
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you're
making...
you
are
urging
that
the
psychiatrists
make
this
decision.
do
they
have
some
psychiatric--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--no.
do
they
have
a
twentieth
century
latter
part
analysis
and
explanation
for
using
this
medieval
concept
that
a
man
must
really
appreciate
why
he's
being
made
to
suffer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
basic
decision
on
the
punishment
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
an
adversary
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
should
that
be
a
final
decision
in
this
third
stage,
or
could
it
be
conditioned,
that
he
could
not
be
executed
until
he
had
recovered
his
capacity
to
grasp
all
the
meaning
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
shearer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
