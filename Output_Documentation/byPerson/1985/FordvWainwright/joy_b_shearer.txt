ms.

b.
shearer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
governor
of
florida
has
determined
that
alvin
ford
is
competent
to
be
executed.
the
fact
that
this
occurred
does
not
give
rise
to
an
eighth
amendment
right,
and
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process
were
satisfied.
at
this
point
the
state
should
be
entitled
to
carry
out
its
lawfully
imposed
sentence.
there
is
no
question
alvin
ford
was
sane
in
1974
when
he
committed
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder
and
when
he
was
tried
and
convicted.
in
1984,
the
governor
of
florida
determined
that
he
was
sane
to
be
executed.
this
was
done
through
the
procedure
outlined
in
florida
statute
92207.
upon
being
informed
by
ford's
attorneys
that
they
believed
ford
was
insane,
the
governor
appointed
a
commission
of
three
psychiatrists.
the
commissioners
were
directed
to
examine
ford
and
to
determine
if
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
death
penalty
and
why
it
was
to
be
imposed
upon
him.
the
three
commissioners
personally
examined
alvin
ford.
they
met
with
his
attorneys
and
accepted
materials
prepared
by
the
attorneys
and
submitted
to
them.
they
reviewed
his
prison
records
and
they
spoke
to
prison
personnel
having
daily
contact
with
ford.
all
three
commissioners
independently
concluded
and
reported
to
the
governor
in
writing
that
ford
did
understand
the
penalty
and
why
it
was
being
imposed.
by
signing
the
death
warrant,
the
governor
accepted
their
conclusions
and
made
the
determination
of
sanity.
we
submit
this
is
akin--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--there
was
an
opinion
which
was
a
psychiatrist
that
ford's
attorneys
asked
to
go
and
see
ford.
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
ford--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--no,
that's
correct.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
they
gave
this
report
to
the
commissioners
and
they
sent
it
to
the
governor's
office,
although
there
was
no
solicitation
of
this
material
by
the
governor.
this
doctor,
however,
only
disagreed
on
one
prong.
he
agreed
that
ford
understood
the
nature
of
the
death
penalty,
but
he
said
ford
apparently
did
not
understand
why
it
was
to
be
imposed
upon
him.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
that's
correct.
we
submit
the
florida
statute
carries
through
the
common
law
humanitarian
policy
and
that
this
does
not
give
rise
to
an
eighth
amendment
right.
in
the
first
place,
the
deferment
of
execution
of
the
insane
is
only
a
temporary
reprieve.
it
does
not
affect
the
fact
that
the
sentence
of
death
is
lawful
and
it
does
not
in
any
way
cancel
it
or
suggest
that
its
imposition
was
wrong.
for
this
reason,
we
submit
that
the
claim
raised
by
ford
does
not
fall
within
the
traditional
scope
of
the
eighth
amendment.
there
have
been
various
justifications
advanced,
both
at
common
law
and
now,
as
to
why
this
prohibition
should
exist.
but
none
of
them
are...
there
is
no
one
single
compelling
rationale
which
has
been
generally
accepted
or
which
ford
suggests
now.
as
to
the
argument
that
it
would
perhaps
prematurely
cut
off
access
to
the
courts,
ford
concedes
that
this
is
not
true
in
his
case
because
he
had
ten
years
of
litigation
and
ample
opportunities
for
judicial
review
prior
to
any
claim
of
insanity
being
made.
as
to
the
insanity
perhaps
being
punishment
enough,
of
course,
this
isn't
true
either,
because
upon
restoration
to
mental
health
the
sentence
would
be
imposed.
as
to
the
argument
that
there
should
be
opportunity
to
prepare
for
death,
i
think
we
should
put
this
is
perspective
and
consider
the
very
little
opportunity
the
victim
in
this
case
had
to
prepare
for
death.
he
saw
a
shotgun
pointed
at
his
head
and
saw
a
shot
go
off,
and
that
was
the
end
of
his
opportunity.
and
ford
certainly
had
ten
years
to
prepare
himself.
and
the
analysis
to
the
elizabeth
kubler-ross
writings--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--well,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
has
heard
the
sentence
pronounced
upon
him
in
court
gives
him
the
opportunity
to
prepare
for
death.
and
the
fact
that
there
is...
we
know
in
any
capital
case
there
is
going
to
be
several
years
of
review,
and
this
does
not--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--yes.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
i
am.
i
think
that
the
florida
standard
is
appropriate
and
it
should
be
the
only
criteria
that
is
necessary
to
determine,
and
that
is
again
if
he
understands
the
nature
of
the
penalty
and
why
it's
to
be
imposed.
that
somewhat
incorporates
preparation
for
death
also,
because
if
he
understands
what's
happening
that
should
be
sufficient.
we
submit
the
penalty
is
just
and
therefore
this
determination,
like
clemency,
falls
outside
the
judicial
process.
in
roberts
versus
the
united
states,
to
answer
a
couple
of
questions
that
came
up,
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
development
of
a
mental
disorder
after
incarceration
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
and
unusual
punishment
because
the
sentence
itself
remains
lawful,
and
the
fact
that
a
particular
person
has
a
problem
adapting
to
prison
does
not
cancel
the
punishment
or
give
rise
to
an
eight
amendment
claim.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
unless
there
was
going
to
be
an
argument
that
the
common
law
prohibition
should
carry
over
and
that
there
was
some
sort
of
fundamental--
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
--no.
no,
your
honor.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
well,
of
course
we
haven't.
ms.
joy
b.
shearer
that's
correct,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right,
because
it's
like
clemency
and
it
falls
outside
any
stage
of
the
judicial
process.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
there
is
not
an
entitlement
to
litigate
every
federal
claim
in
a
federal
court,
and
even
if
the
court
finds
an
eighth
amendment
right
we
submit
that
our
governor
acted
as
a
neutral
and
detached
decision
maker
and
that,
since
the
actual
carrying
out
of
the
sentence
is
an
executive
function,
it's
appropriately
entrusted
to
him
to
determine
the
competency
of
one
who
is
to
be
executed;
and
that
likewise,
our
standard
is
adequate
and
that
it
doesn't
need
to
be
further
expanded.
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
solesbee
versus
balkcom,
which
the
court
of
appeals
applied
in
this
case
and
held
controlling,
was
correctly
decided.
in
solesbee,
this
court
held
that
a
determination
of
competence
for
being
executed
is
an
executive
function,
like
clemency,
and
that
the
governor,
with
the
aid
of
expert
opinion,
can
make
this
decision
and
due
process
is
satisfied.
nothing,
no
developments
in
the
law
that
have
occurred
since
solesbee
have
in
any
way
diluted
the
validity
of
the
court's
reasoning
in
that
opinion.
the
gardner
case,
which
came
up
in
recent
times,
dealt
with
the
initial
selection
of
persons
who
were
to
be
sentenced
to
death
and
did
not
deal
with
post-conviction
insanity,
like
this
case.
we
submit
that,
since
all
judicial
remedies
had
been
exhausted
at
the
point
when
the
claim
was
made
and
that
due
process
can
be
flexible,
that
this
procedure
that
we
have
in
florida
adequately
balances
the
competing
interests
identified
by
this
court
is
the
mathews
versus
eldridge
opinion.
we
submit
that
ford's
private
interest
at
this
point
is
minimal,
because
he
has
had
many,
many
years
in
which
the
validity
of
the
judgment
and
sentence
have
been
litigated
directly
and
collaterally.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
does
have
a
valid
interest
in
bringing
an
end
to
litigation
and
carrying
out
this
sentence.
in
this
case,
no
claim
of
insanity
was
every
presented
to
any
court
until
ten
days
prior
to
the
scheduled
date
of
execution,
although,
the
claim
being
that
the
governor's
procedure
was
inadequate,
certainly
a
judicial
determination
could
have
been
sought
at
an
earlier
time.
the
district
court
did
find
an
abuse
of
the
writ
in
this
case,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
reach
that
issue,
but
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
note
that
we
do
have
a
valid
interest
in
finality
and
that
this
is
one
reason
why
our
present
procedure
is
appropriate.
the
governor
can
make
the
determination
in
a
reasonably
expeditious
manner,
and
that
properly
respects
the
individual's
interest,
but
it
also
serves
the
state's
interest.
we
submit
that
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
is
negligible
because
the
governor
is
advised
by
a
panel
of
experts.
in
the
gilmore
versus
utah
case,
this
court
was
willing
to
accept
expert
determinations
in
the
state
system
of
competency
to
waive
direct
appellate
rights.
so
certainly
in
this
case,
many
years
after
the
original
conviction,
the
governor's
determination,
which
was
based
on
expert
opinions,
can
be
accepted
and
it
can
bring
this
matter
to
a
conclusion.
our
statute
strikes
the
proper
balance
between
these
interests.
in
barefoot
versus
estelle,
this
court
took
note
that
federal
habeas
corpus
is
not
a
forum
to
relitigate
state
trials.
and
certainly,
it's
even
less
so
a
means
by
which
a
defendant
can
indefinitely
delay
execution.
therefore
in
this
case,
bearing
that
in
mind,
we
submit
that
the
state
has
properly
respected
alvin
ford's
concerns
and
that
the
judgment
and
sentence
are
lawful,
his
competency
has
been
determined,
and
that
the
eleventh
circuit
properly
ruled
in
this
case
to
affirm
the
judgment
denying
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
ask
that
that
decision
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
