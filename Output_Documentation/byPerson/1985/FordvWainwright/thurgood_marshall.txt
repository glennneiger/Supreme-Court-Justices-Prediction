what
about
a
state
law
that
said
that
the
governor
shall
appoint
a
commission
of
five
reputable
psychiatrists
to
decide
as
to
whether
he
was
sane
enough
to
be
executed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
you'd
want
to
get
in
there
and
decide
what
kind
of
hearing
that
the
five
psychiatrists
held?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
five
psychiatrists
are
made
the
decision
makers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
they
have
a
right
to
a
dissenting
opinion,
just
the
same
as
i
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
one
of
those
psychiatrists
have
a
right
to
a
dissenting
opinion,
just
the
same
as
i
have
a
right
to
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
more
do
you
have
to
cite
that
says
that
five
psychiatrists
cannot
be
designated
by
the
state
as
a
"fact
finding
body"?
why
can't
a
state
say
that
that
is
a
fact
finding
body
for
this
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
need
the
commission.
he'd
plead
guilty
and
plead
that
he
was
insane.
i'm
talking
about
where
there
is
a
dispute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
five
judges
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judges
don't
have
to
be
lawyers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
could
be
psychiatrists.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
are
you
arguing
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
say
the
procedure
would
not
be
adversarial?
all
i
said
the
fact
finders
would
be,
that's
all
i
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
just
discarded
all
the
atheists?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
no
hearing.
the
governor
did
not
hold
a
hearing.
