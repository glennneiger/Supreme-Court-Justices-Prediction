you
mean
even
in
the
absence
of
a
convention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
without...
supposing
there
had
been
no
convention
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
argument...
some
plausible
argument
to
be
made,
mr.
lauber,
do
you
think,
that
although
the
florida
tax
does
breach
reciprocity
the
canadian
provincial
tax
don't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
find
that
consensus
reflected,
in
some
document
or--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
florida,
counsel,
reserves
the
right
to
tax
other
foreign
airplanes
besides
canadian
planes
on
their
fuel,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
may
be
a
good
defense
to
this
case,
but
how
about
florida's
assertion
of
a
power
to
tax,
say,
you
know,
a
plane
flying
from
miami
to
london,
a
british
plane,
or
a
belgium
plane
flying
from
brussels
to
miami?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
think
then
the
fact
that
the
canadian
provinces
that
are
imposing
a
tax
here...
is
it
kind
of
a
make
weight
argument
for
your
side
or
is
it
a
pretty
important
argument
or
does
it
really
not
amount
to
very
much?
