well,
mr.
hansen,
in
japan
line
i
think
the
court
at
least
expressed
considerable
concern,
reliance
upon
the
asymmetry
that
would
exist,
and
here,
i
guess,
canada
imposes
a
tax
on
fuel
under
the
same
circumstances
that
florida
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
certainly...
it
certainly
cuts
back
on
the
reliance
you
can
place
on
japan
lines
in
my
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
does
section
1513(b)
of
title
49
which
says
states
can
levy
sales
taxes
have
any
application
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
the
statute
does
not
differentiate
between
foreign
and
domestic
flights.
