mr.
joseph
c.
mellichamp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
excise
tax,
which
is
a
sales
tax,
imposed
by
florida
upon
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
selling
tangible
personal
property,
which
in
this
case
includes
aviation
fuel,
unconstitutionally
impairs
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
foreign
commerce.
the
case
is
a
narrow
constitutional
challenge
to
the
exercise
of
this
fundamental
state
power,
the
power
to
tax,
the
power
to
tax
purchases
of
goods
in
the
state.
the
challenge
by
the
appellant
rests
on
two
grounds
and
those
two
grounds
are
set
forth
in
the
japan
line
case
of
this
court.
in
that
case
this
court
said
when
you
are
looking
to
taxes
that
affected
foreign
commerce
there
were
two
additional
tests
beyond
that
in
the
complete
auto
case.
there
were
four
of
them
in
that
case.
in
this
case,
the
tax
unquestionably
passes
the
four-prong
test
in
complete
auto.
we
are
left
with
two
in
japan
line.
the
first
in
japan
line
was
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation.
the
parties
in
this
case
concede
there
are
no
such
risks
of
multiple
taxation
in
this
case
unlike
in
japan
line
where
there
was
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
a
container
and
that
container
could
be
taxed
somewhere
else
and
in
that
case
in
japan...
in
fact,
was
taxed
in
japan.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
excise
tax
or
sales
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state
of
florida.
that
incident
can
only
be
taxed
once.
the
second
ground
in
japan
line
and
the
ground
that
the
appellant
relies
on
is
that
it
prevents
the
united
states
from
speaking
with
one
voice.
and,
it
is
the
appellant's
position
that
there
are
two
grounds
for
finding
a
violation
of
this
test.
the
first
ground
was
that
the
tax,
the
sales
tax
involved
in
this
case
was
pre-empted
by
federal
legislation
and
the
international
agreements
or
the
executive
agreements
involved
in
this
case.
and,
the
second
ground
was
that
the
state
excise
tax
impermissibly
intrudes
upon
the
federal
government's
power
over
foreign
affairs.
on
the
first
issue
of
pre-emption,
they
claim
that
under
the
federal
aviation
act
that
the
congress
has
pre-empted
this
entire
area.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
contained
in
any
of
the
provisions
they
cite
that
pre-empts
the
state
from
imposing
an
otherwise
valid
sales
tax,
in
fact,
such
as
before
the
court
today.
and,
in
fact,
section
1513(b)
evidences
congress'
intend
to
preserve
that
source
of
income
to
the
state
of
florida,
in
other
words,
sales
tax.
and,
that
section,
as
this
court
found
in
the
aloha
case,
congress
preserved
that
right
or
reserved
that
right
to
the
states,
whereas
in
subsection
(a)
of
that
section
it
prohibited
or
preempted
certain
state
taxes.
so,
now
we
are
down
to
the
international
agreements,
or
in
this
particular
case,
one
international
agreement.
the
question
when
you
look
at
the
international
agreement
is
what
is
the
one
voice
that
the
federal
government
has
spoken
in
these
agreements?
i
would
submit
that
in
those
agreements
what
the
federal
government
has
done
is
reserve
its
sovereign
right
to
allow
the
states
to
tax
as
they
please
as
long
as
the
tax
is
not
discriminatory
in
this
area
of
sales
tax.
the
agreement
itself
speaks
only
to
national
excise
taxes.
the
convention
of
1944
speaks
only
of
national
and
local
taxes
on
fuel
brought
into
the
country.
the
resolution
that
was
mentioned
by
the
appellant
that
was
done
in
1966,
while
it
speaks
to
state
taxes
or
taxes
on
a
local
level,
this
resolution,
i
submit,
has
never
been
incorporated
into
this
agreement
or
any
other
of
the
agreements.
in
fact,
the
united
states
has
reserved
its
sovereign
power
in
this
area
in
these
agreements.
some
of
the
other
agreements
mentioned
by
the
various
amicus
in
this
case,
some
of
the
newer
agreements
after
1978,
use
the
term
"best
efforts"
and
this
begs
the
question,
if
the
united
states
in
these
agreements,
other
agreements
involved
in
this
case,
are
saying
they
will
use
their
best
efforts,
it
is
an
admission
that
the
agreements
don't
cover
this
area.
it
is
an
admission
that
the
federal
government
has
reserved
its
sovereign
power
in
this
area
to
allow
the
states
to
tax
as
they
please
as
long
as
it
is
not
discriminatory.
so,
the
federal
policy
is
not
there.
the
federal
policy
is
there,
florida
would
submit,
that
allows
the
state
to
impose
this
tax.
that
policy
is
expressed
in
these
agreements.
the
only
other
two
grounds
for
a
federal
policy
to
violate
is
the
threat
of
retaliation
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
canada,
under
this
agreement,
allows
its
provinces
to
do
the
same
that
the
united
states,
in
reserving
its
sovereign
power,
allows
the
state
of
florida
to
do.
mr.
joseph
c.
mellichamp,
iii
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
joseph
c.
mellichamp,
iii
none
of
the
agreements
that
are
before
this
court,
justice
rehnquist,
affect
or
discuss
or
pre-empt
or
prohibit
state
excise
taxes
or
sales
taxes
involved
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
points
this
out.
none
of
them
talk
about
it.
all
of
them
reserve
the
sovereign
right
of
the
united
states
to
allow
the
states
to
tax
as
they
please
as
long
as
it
doesn't
discriminate.
mr.
joseph
c.
mellichamp,
iii
when
you
are
looking
to
see
what
these
agreements
cover
and
how
the
people
that
negotiated
them,
the
nations
that
negotiated
them,
felt
were
covered,
what
were
covered
in
these
agreements,
it
has
considerable
weight,
because
in
this
case,
the
other
nation
in
this
case
considers
the
agreements
not
to
prohibit
such
taxation
by
their
subnational
units
of
government
and
in
that
respect
it
has
some
weight.
the
other
source
of
federal
policy
only
exists
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
and
only
at
the
request
of
this
court
was
that
brief
submitted.
florida
submits
to
this
court
that
the
agreements,
the
convention
evidences
the
federal
policy
that
was
not
evident
in
the
japan
line
case,
but
was
evident
in
the
container
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
found
that
on
numerous
occasions
treaties
were
entered
into
by
the
united
states,
but
specifically
would
not
address
the
taxation
of
income
by
states.
i
submit
in
this
case
the
same
is
evident
for
this
court,
that
in
numerous,
in
all
occasions
in
these
executive
agreements
entered
into
by
the
federal
government,
none
of
them
prohibit
the
states
from
imposing
sales
tax.
all
of
them
reserve
the
united
states
sovereign
power
to
allow
the
states
to
do
this
just
as
in
the
container
case.
i
would
submit
that
florida's
tax
has
not
been
pre-empted,
that
florida's
tax
does
not
impair
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
speak
with
one
voice
and,
as
such,
the
tax
is
not
unconstitutional.
