mr.
walter
d.
hansen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
spring
of
1983,
florida
enacted
and
began
collecting
an
unapportioned
fuel
tax
on
aviation
fuel
uplifted
in
florida
by
wardair,
a
canadian
airline,
and
by
other
foreign
airlines,
such
fuel
to
be
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce.
wardair
challenged
the
validity
of
that
tax
in
a
florida
circuit
court
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
violated
the
terms
of
the
nonscheduled
air
services
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
canada,
an
agreement
which
regulates
the
foreign
air
transport
services
which
wardair
can
provide
in
and
out
of
the
united
states.
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
tax
was
constitutional,
but
that
it
did
violate
the
terms
of
the
bilateral
agreement
and
issued
an
appropriate
injunction.
on
appeal,
the
case
was
certified
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
that
court
again
held
the
tax
to
be
constitutional,
but
that
it
did
not
violate
the
terms
of
the
bilateral
agreement
because
there
was
no
exemption
from
the
payment
of
a
state
fuel
tax.
that
decision
is
at
total
odds
with
japan
line
against
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
california
tax
on
cargo
containers
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce
and
owned
by
foreign
nationals
was
unconstitutional
even
though
there
was
no
specific
federal
prohibition
against
the
tax.
the
question
in
this
case
is
identical
to
the
question
in
the
japan
line
decision,
whether
a
state
has
the
power
to
tax
an
instrument
of
foreign
commerce
owned
by
foreign
nationals
and
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce.
the
japan
line
case
is
a
pure
one
involving,
as
it
does,
solely
the
power
over
foreign
commerce,
an
exclusive
preserve
of
the
federal
government,
with
no
parts
shared
with
the
individual
states.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes,
you
are
quite
right,
justice
o'connor.
but,
it
is
my
belief
that
that
fact
does
not
enter
into
this
case
as
an
issue.
what
it
does
do
is
show--
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
--well,
no,
i
respectfully
disagree.
what
it
does
show,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
if
there
is
a
method
to
remedy
the
problem
that
the
united
states
may
have
with
canada
as
to
this
reciprocity,
the
federal
government
has
to
have
the
exclusive
power
to
devise
the
remedy
to
suit
the
national
interest.
it
cannot
be
worried
about
what
the
individual
states
may
do
with
that
circumstance.
it
has
to
have
the
power.
the
federal
government
has
to
have
the
power
to
attempt
to
remedy
and
it
is
doing
that
right
now.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes.
the
tax
is
a
tax--
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
--it
is
imposed
by
the
provinces,
just
like
florida
is
imposing
a
tax
here.
i
might
suggest,
however,
that
insofar
as
that
problem
is
concerned,
there
are
several
things
to
consider.
one,
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
not
been
a
u.s.
air
carrier
which
has
challenged
that
tax
in
canada.
two,
there
is
presently
a
diplomatic
initiative
in
an
attempt
to
seek
a
remedy
to
that
problem.
and,
three,
one
of
the
united
states
air
carriers
that
performs
service
to
canada
has
joined
with
other
carriers
in
an
amici
brief
supporting
wardair's
case
today.
in
the
containers
corp.
of
america
against
the
franchise
tax
board,
this
court
commented
on
the
japan
line
case,
saying
that
it
was
consistent
with
international
practice
and
expressed
federal
policy.
that
case
is
a
pure
case
involving
the
power
of
the
federal
government
over
foreign
commerce.
and,
this
case
is
as
pure.
it
is
wardair's
contention
that
the
japan
line
decision
should
be
considered
here.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
by
the
florida
tax?
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
well,
i
can't
answer
insofar
as
canada
is
concerned.
i
do
know
that
the
provision
in
the
nonscheduled
air
services
agreement
shows
that
the
countries
are
to
provide
these
tax
exemptions
to
the
best
possible
way
that
the
national
law
will
provide.
now,
whether
or
not
canada
can
do
anything
about
this
problem,
i
don't
really
know.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
well,
i
did
insofar
as
it
violated
the...
what
those
tax
exemptions
demonstrate
and
they
demonstrate
just
what
this
court
concluded
was
demonstrated
by
the
customs
convention
on
containers
in
japan
line.
it
demonstrated
a
desirability
for
a
uniform--
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
--yes.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
there
is
no
specific
exemption
from
a
state
tax
in
the
chicago
convention
or
the
nonscheduled
air
services
agreement.
in
japan
line
there
were
three
elements
which
were
essential
to
the
court's
decision.
the
subject
taxed
was
owned
by
a
foreign
national.
it
was
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce
and
it
was
an
instrument
of
foreign
commerce.
all
three
of
those
elements
are
met
here.
wardair
is
a
foreign
national.
the
aviation
fuel
it
uplifts
out
of
florida
is
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce.
wardair
cannot
provide
any
service
other
than
foreign
air
transportation
exclusively.
and,
it
is
an
instrument
of
foreign
commerce.
now,
an
instrument
of
foreign
commerce
is
no
term
of
art.
means
of
commerce
is
another
way
of
expressing
it
as
shown
by
this
court
in
helson
against
kentucky
where
it
found
that
fuel
used
to
propel
a
transport
vehicle
was
an
instrument
of
commerce.
in
japan
line,
the
court
found
that
the
cargo
containers
were
instrument
of
foreign
commerce
as
a
matter
of
law
based
on
the
tax
exemption
provisions
contained
in
customs
convention
on
containers.
in
that
convention
for
cargo
containers
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce
the
convention
provided
an
exemption
from
national
import
duties
and
national
import
taxes
and
that
is
all.
it
did
not
exempt
from
any
state
taxes,
yet
this
court
held
the
california
tax
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
this
case,
both
the
chicago
convention
and
the
nonscheduled
air
services
agreement
provide
tax
exemptions
almost
exactly
the
same
as
those
contained
in
the
customs
convention
on
containers
plus
other
state
exemptions
for
aviation
fuel
uplifted...
i
am
sorry,
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce
and
cover
fuel
which
is
uplifted
in
the
territory
of
one
country
by
the
carrier
of
another,
thus
wardair's
aviation
fuel
uplifts
in
florida
are
covered.
now,
the
court
in
japan
line
showed
that
it
was
not
important
whether
the
exemption
granted
an
exemption
from
state
taxes.
what
it
did
show
is
what
it
demonstrates,
what
the
tax
exemption
demonstrates.
and,
the
court
reasoned
that
the
tax
exemption
provision
evidenced
a
desirability
for
a
uniform
federal
regulation
of
containers
used
exclusively
in
international
commerce
and
reflected
a
federal
policy
to
remove
all
impediments
as
to
their
use
as
instruments
of
foreign
commerce.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
held
that
since
the
california
tax
frustrated
the
attainment
of
that
federal
regulatory
uniformity,
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
power
of
congress
over
foreign
commerce
and,
therefore,
unconstitutional.
that
same
reasoning
and
that
same
ultimate
conclusion
is
as
applicable
in
this
case.
florida's
tax
on
wardair's
fuel
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
a
serious
infringement
on
the
power
of
congress
over
foreign
commerce.
there
is
another
element
here
that
is
not
contained
in
the
japan
line
case
that
bolsters
the
case
against
the
florida
fuel
tax.
congress
has
expressed
a
clear
mandate
through
the
federal
aviation
act
requiring
the
uniform
federal
regulation
of
foreign
air
transportation.
even
though
congress
deregulated
domestic
air
transportation
almost
eight
years
ago,
the
federal
government
still
regulates
on
a
highly
structured
basis
through
the
federal
aviation
act
all
foreign
air
transportation
and
the
reason
is
clear.
united
states
air
carrier
participation
in
foreign
air
transportation
is
totally
dependent
upon
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
operate
effectively
in
regulating
foreign
air
transportation
with
foreign
governments
and
reaching
adequate
international
regulatory
agreements
or
understandings
based
on
reciprocity
and
comity.
the
uniform
federal
regulation
of
foreign
air
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
absolutely
essential
if
that
national
interest
purpose
is
to
be
met.
by
section
1102
of
the
federal
aviation
act,
congress
enacted
a
set
of
goals
to
be
met
through
the
international
regulatory
agreement
signed
by
the
united
states.
those
goals
include
the
reduction
of
discrimination
and
the
increased
competition
opportunities
by
the
united
states
air
carriers
in
foreign
air
transportation.
any
unilateral
state
action
which
may
disrupt
the
regulatory
balance
as
to
foreign
air
transportation
reached
by
the
international
regulatory
agreements
signed
by
the
united
states
would
either
impair
or
thwart
the
achievement
of
those
statutory
goals
set
by
congress
and
thereby
infringe
on
congress'
power
over
foreign
commerce.
there
is
one
other
aspect
to
this
case.
if
there
is
proliferation
of
any
such
interferences
by
states
such
as
florida's
tax
on
wardair's
fuel,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
japan
line,
would
make
speaking
with
one
voice
impossible,
yet
if
the
florida
supreme
court
is
not
reversed
here,
such
a
proliferation
will
take
place.
the
amici
brief
supporting
florida
in
this
case
makes
that
fact
known
very
clearly.
now,
this
case
concerns
solely
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
foreign
air
transportation
in
concert
with
its
foreign
government
partners
and
to
devise
such
remedies
as
the
national
interests
warrant
when
there
are
disagreements
with
those
partners.
this
power
over
foreign
commerce--
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
--okay.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes.
well,
whether
it
is
a
sales
tax
or
excise
tax,
it
depends
upon
who
you
talk
to.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes,
i
do.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
yes,
i
do.
this
case
concerns
solely
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
and
that
is
the
reason
there
is
no
pre-emption
question
in
this
case.
florida
did
not
have
the
power
to
tax
wardair's
fuel.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
in
the
absence
of
the...
with
the
circumstances
which
we
have
in
this
case,
it
is
our
position
that
they
did
not
have
the
power.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
oh,
yes.
i
think
even
in
the
absence
of
such
a
convention
because
whatever
is
done
in
foreign
air
transportation
it
is
done
in
concert
by
the
united
states
and
foreign
governments.
there
cannot
be
any
foreign
air
transportation
unless
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
governments
as
to
what
air
transportation
will
be
permitted.
that
ability
is
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
and
the
states
have
no
power
in
that
area.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
foreign
air
transportation
and
what
happened
here
was
that
florida
intruded
and
that
intrusion--
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
--that
question
has
not
been
brought
to
this
case.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
to
this
court.
and,
in
japan
line,
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
supreme
court
reserved
its
decision
on
that
point.
and,
now,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
you
are
asking
me
to
hazard
a
guess
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
will
do.
mr.
walter
d.
hansen
if
it
is
construed
to
be
foreign
air
transportation
and
not
a
question
of
a
domestic
power
such
as
was
contained
in
the
containers
corp.
of
america
with
just
resinouses
of
foreign
commerce,
but
strictly
involved
foreign
commerce
and
foreign
air
transportation,
then
i
would
say
that
florida
would
violate
the
constitution.
here,
again,
some
of
the
united
states
air
carriers
that
brought
the
case
up
from
florida
did
not
raise
that
question.
they
raised
interstate
commerce
questions
solely.
