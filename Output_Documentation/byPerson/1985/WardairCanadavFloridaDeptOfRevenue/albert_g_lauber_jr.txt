mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
the
canadian
problem
we
have
in
the
case.
it
is
somewhat
ironic
that
this
case
involves
a
carrier
from
the
only
nation
in
the
world
that
to
our
knowledge
lets
its
political
subdivisions
impose
taxes
on
aviation
fuel
use
by
foreign
carriers.
two
canadian
provinces,
quebec
and
alberta,
exempt
foreign
carriers
from
the
tax,
but
the
balance
do
impose
a
tax.
i
should
note
that
the
state
department
has
not
yet
determined
finally
whether
these
canadian
provincial
taxes
do
breach
reciprocity.
we
think
that
they
probably
do,
but
that
question
is
often
a
rather
ambiguous
one.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
can
imagine
arguments
canada
might
try
to
make
to
defend
the
tax.
they
might
try
and
defend
the
tax
in
some
kind
of
price
equalization
measure
to
bring
up
the
eastern
seaboard
prices
to
the
level
comparable
to
western.
they
might
try
and
defend
it.
we
think
they
probably
could
not
do
that
successfully.
we
think
here
it
is
quite
clear
that
these
taxes
do
breach
reciprocity.
but,
in
other
cases,
it
might
be
very
unclear.
it
is
very
often--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--by
that
we
mean
the
international
consensus
that
aviation
fuel
used
by
foreign
carriers
in
foreign
commerce
should
be
exempt
from
all
taxes
except
those
imposed
by
the
home
country
of
the
airline
and
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
chicago
convention
by
its
terms
says
that
foreign
carriers
are
to
be
exempt
from
tax
on
aviatic
fuel
they
bring
into
a
country,
exempt
both
from
national
taxes
and
local
taxes.
that
is
a
treaty
ratified
by
the
senate.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right.
you
have
to
go
further
to
get
to
this
case.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
treaty
by...
if
the
treaty
pre-empted
the
tax,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
however,
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
which
is
an
arm
of
the
convention
has
adopted
resolutions
which
have
extended
the
exemption
from
local
and
national
taxes
to
include
that
only
fuel
brought
into
a
country,
but
fuel,
equipment,
and
supplies
taken
on
board
within
the
country.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
international
civil
aviation
organization.
that
resolution
has
no
force
of
law,
but
it
expresses
the
strong
commitment
of
all
parties
to
the
convention
to
this
policy
of
reciprocal
tax
exemption
for
aviation
fuel.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
except
for
the
canadian
provinces.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
for
florida
and
several
other
states
have
followed
florida's
example.
but,
in
our
view,
the
key
thing
is
it
is
not
the
particular
taxing
practices
of
different
foreign
countries
or
their
provinces
that
determine
the
outcome
here.
it
is
the
federal
policy
of
reciprocal
exemptions.
we
are
now
at
the
negotiations
with
canada
to
try
and
get
this
situation
resolved
and
florida's
action
has
impeded
our
ability
to
do
that
because
we
can't
really
promise
canada
exemptions
here
and--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--we
is
the
transportation
department
aided
by
the
state
department
who
are
charged
by
the
faa
act
with
negotiating--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
they
have
been
empowered
by
congress
to
enter
into
bilateral
aviation
agreements
and
we
believe--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--they
don't
fully
control
the
case,
but--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--but,
they
do
evidence,
as
the
customs
convention
on
containers
evidence
in
japan
line
a
very
strong
federal
and
international
commitment
to
avoiding
the
kinds
of
taxes
involved
here.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
depend
on
them
the
way
the
shipping
company
in
japan
line
depended
on
the
container
convention.
that
multilateral
compact
did
not
pre-empt
state
taxes,
but
the
court
viewed
it
as
showing
a
very
strong
federal
and
worldwide
commitment
to
a
tax
exemption
for
chicago
container.
so,
we
think
just
as
the
container
convention
was
evidentiary
of
the
correct
result
while
not
dispositive
in
japan
line,
the
same
is
true
here
of
the
chicago
convention
in
the
various
bilateral
agreements.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
clearly.
the
agreements
all
bar
national
taxes.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but,
the
same
is
true
in
japan
line,
justice
white.
the
congress
in
a
way
had
spoken
there
by
enacting
the
container
convention
which
barred
taxes
imposed
by
reason
of
the
importation.
they
addressed
taxes
only
to
that
degree
and
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
despite
the
lack
of
expressed
pre-emption
there
is
still
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
indeed,
if
one
required
a
congressional
statute
on
point,
there
would
never
be
any
commerce
clause
jurisprudence.
by
definition
we
only
rely
on
the
negative
implications
of
the
commerce
clause
when
the
reason
of
the
statute--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--justice
marshall,
the
airline
is
required--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--in
our
view,
they
should
be
exempt
from
sales
tax
on
equipment
and
fuel
they
use
on
the
aircraft
in
international
commerce.
they
pay
sales
tax
on
the
computer
equipment
in
the
terminal.
they
pay
user
fees
for
equipment
they
rent
from
the
state
at
the
airport.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
this
goes
up
in
the
air
on
the
way
to
foreign
nations.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that
is--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
is
a
difficult
question,
but
our
position
is
that
the
food
taken
onboard
to
be
fed
to
the
passengers
in
international
traffic
also
must
be
exempt
from
sales
tax.
food
that
people
eat
in
the
terminal
when
doing
the
tickets
is
not
exempt
from
sales
tax.
whatever
goes
into
the
plane
to
facilitate
international
transportation,
in
our
view,
must
be
exempt
from
tax
as
it
is
in
every
other
country
of
the
world
except,
it
seems,
in
some
canadian
provinces.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
were
it
not
for...
that
section
makes
it
clear
that
a
sales
tax
per
se
can
be
levied
on
airlines
which
means
the
domestic
airlines
can
be
required
to
be
paid
the
tax,
but
whether
the
tax
can
be
applied
constitutionally
to
one
group
of
airlines,
namely
the
foreign
airlines,
is
a
constitutional
question
which
congress
didn't
address
in
that
statute.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but,
that
statute
had
a
rather
narrow
purpose.
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
an
overruling
of
this
court's
decision
which
allowed
a
head
tax
to
be
imposed,
a
per-passenger
head
tax
by
states,
and
congress
declared
in
section
a
of
that
provision
that
head
taxes
could
not
be
imposed,
thereby
overruling
the
court's
decision.
but
then
to
reassure
the
states
it
enacted
b
which
said
that
other
taxes
of
general
application
were
not
pre-empted.
but,
we
don't
think
congress
had
in
mind
anything
like
what
we
have
here
which
is
a
tax
imposed
on
foreign
airlines,
fuel
use
in
foreign
commerce.
let
me
say
one
thing
about
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
containers
in
japan
line.
our
view
would
be
that
if
the
containers...
if
the
japanese
company
there
bought
containers
in
california
to
replace
containers
on
their
container
ships
and
used
them
solely
in
foreign
commerce,
they
would
have
an
exemption
from
sales
tax.
they
would
not
be
exempt
from
equipment
they
bought
in
the
state
to
be
used
in
california.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
think
there
is
no
risk
of
that
here.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
different,
but
the
court
in
japan
line
quite
clearly
said
that
if
the
state
tax
either
creates
a
risk
of
multiple
taxation
or
prevents
federal
uniformity
from
being
achieved,
it
would
be
invalid.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
in
container
corporation
where
the
court
did
find
multiple
taxation,
they
nevertheless
upheld
the
california
unitary
income
tax
on
a
u.s.
company.
we
think
that
shows
that
the
multiple
taxation
is
not
really
the
key
to
japan
line
because
that
aspect
was
present
in
container
corporation.
i
think
what
container
shows
is
that
the
key
to
japan
line
is
really
the
second
part
of
the
test
which
we
do
have
here.
thank
you.
