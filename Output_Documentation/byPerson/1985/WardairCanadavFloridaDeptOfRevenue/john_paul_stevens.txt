mr.
hansen,
just
to
clear
up
one
point
for
me
to
be
sure
i
am
right
on
it,
you
do
not
contend,
as
i
understand
your
position,
that
there
is
a
violation
of
any
specific
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
your
executive
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
or
by
the
provincial
tax
in
canada,
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
more
narrowly,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
did
not
contend
that
the
florida
tax
violated
that
convention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
that
all
is
support
for
your
basic
argument
that
japan
line
controls
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
as
i
understand,
you
do
not
independently
argue
that
the
convention
itself
provides
a
federal
reason
for
holding
a
state
tax
unconstitutional.
maybe
you
did.
i
missed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
goes
back
to
japan
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
tax?
that
was
a
property
tax
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
here
we
have
a
sales
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
japan
airlines
would
have
made
it
unconstitutional
for
california?
say
the
containers
had
been
manufactured
in
california.
you
can
impose
a
sales
tax
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
you
think
this
is
the
same
as
if
they
imposed
a
property
tax
on
the...
if
they
imposed
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
value
of
the
gasoline
while
it
was
in
the
state
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
is
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
principle
apply
to
an
american
carrier
which
buys
gasoline
in
florida
just
for
its
overseas
flights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
wondering
whether
your
evaluation
of
your
own
principle
would
apply
in
that
case
or
not
or
you
just
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
we
mean
when
you
say
"we"
can't?
are
you
talking
about
the
president,
congress,
this
organization
you
referred
to?
who
is
the
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
lawmaking
authority
that
supersedes
the
power
of
a
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
they
have
done
and
which
don't
control
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
emphasis
in
the
japan
case
of
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation?
do
you
have
that
risk
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
on
that
ground
it
is
different
from
japan
line?
