both
issues
in...
rescission
and
benefit
of
the
bargain
were
submitted
to
the
jury
for
findings
of
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
government
might
have
an
interest
in
appearing
as
amicus
before
any
court
reviewing
any
sort
of
awards
to
plaintiffs,
urging
that
the
awards
be
increased
on
that
basis
because
the
government
would
get
more
tax
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
may
constitute
income
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code
can
be
quite
different
from
what
we
think
of
normally
as
income,
can
it
not?
