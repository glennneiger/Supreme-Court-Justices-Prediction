mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
question
here--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--all
the
respondents,
sir,
mr.
loftsgaarden
and
his
corporation.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
he
is
very
much
in
the
picture,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
with
mr.
loftsgaarden
exclusively,
and
his
corporations.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the...
well,
i
don't
know
the
status
of
the
corporations.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
mr.
loftsgaarden
is
not
paying
the
bill,
sir.
the
investors
have
invested
in
a
tax
shelter.
the
tax
shelter
promised
them
savings
on
their
taxes,
and
returned
what
was
promised.
section
28
of
the
1934
act
says
that
no
person
shall
recover
a
total
amount
in
excess
of
his
actual
damages
on
account
of
the
act
complained
of.
all
measures
of
damage
under
the
1933
act
contemplate
a
return
as
well
to
the
status
quo
ante.
no
punitive
damages
are
awardable
under
either
act.
the
courts
have
held
this
for
many
years.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
deterrence
is
a
function
of
the
securities
laws,
sir,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
yes,
and
penal
sanctions
are
found
in
the
securities
laws,
but
the
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
to
be
construed
by
the
court
in
this
case
are
compensatory
in
nature.
they
are
the
civil
damage
remedies
and
no
court
has
sanctioned
an
award
of
anything
beyond
such
remedy
in
interpreting
those
sections.
the
lower
courts
tried
to
apply
that
principle
carefully
to
the
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
examined
the
investment
each
investor
made
and
the
returns,
the
economic
benefits,
that
each
investor
received
from
this
investment.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
would
have
this
court
ignore
the
returns
so
received
by
the
investors,
not
because
they
were
unreal,
not
because
they
lacked
value,
not
because
they
were
speculative
and
not
because
the
petitioners
failed
to
receive
them,
but
because
they
feel
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
making
the
petitioners
more
than
whole
would
deter
violations
of
the
securities
act
or
otherwise
serve
tax
policy.
the
difference
in
an
award
made
by
the
lower
court,
taking
tax
benefits
into
account,
and
an
award
sought
by
the
petitioners,
is
the
difference
between
an
award
of
20,000
some
odd
dollars,
and
an
award
of
close
to
$300,000,
the
$280,000
penalty
that
is
sought
to
be
enforced
against
the
petitioners...
excuse
me,
against
the
respondents...
even
though
the
petitioners
are
not
out
of
pocket
anything.
now,
i
would
propose
to
address--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
is
not.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
i
expect
it
may.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
or
nothing
i
am
aware
of,
to
suggest
that
since
austin
one
was
decided
some
four
years
ago,
there
has
been
an
abatement
of
tax
shelter
litigation
and
i
don't
know
that
enhancing
the
penalty
here
would
create
such
an
abatement
or
would
encourage
people
to
sue
or
not,
or
would
act
as
a
deterrent.
but
as
to
the
economic
matter,
it
seems
logical
that
the
more
penalty
associated
with
an
action,
the
less
the
action
will
occur,
yes,
sir.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
arguments
raised
by
the
government
that
to
follow
the
rule
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
second
circuit
constitutes
subsidizing
fraud,
and
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
statutory
construction
argument
made
by
mr.
brunig
earlier.
the
government
and
the
petitioners
are
fond
of
speaking
of
fraud
here.
the
statutes
to
be
construed
do
involve
fraud
under
the
'34
act,
but
the
'33
act
statute
is
a
negligence
statute.
in
addition,
section
11
of
the
'33
act,
which
would
govern
public
offerings
of
tax
shelters
is
a
strict
liability
statute.
the
subsidy,
so
called,
can
best
be
viewed
in
the
context,
i
think,
of
one
of
the
petitioners,
and
i
propose
to
use
dr.
austin
as
the
example
there.
dr.
austin
originally
invested
$35,000.
he
was
returned
$33,000
through
his
tax
benefits,
and
he
stands
out
of
pocket
now
$2,000.
the
so-called
subsidy
is
represented
by
this
$33,000
contribution
of
the
government.
the
government
is
not
subsidizing
a
fraud.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
depending
on
the
situation,
the
normal
result
would
be
that
following
rescission
the
monies
received
would
be
treated
as
income
by
the
petitioners
here.
however,
the
income
would
not
be
taxed
at
anything
like
the
100
percent
rate.
again,
consider
again
dr.
austin,
who
has
already
received
a
permanent
tax
benefit
of
$33,000.
if
he
would
receive
his
$35,000
back
at
this
time,
the
most
the
government
would
take
would
be
$17,000
or
so,
leaving
him
with
a$15,000
windfall
on
this
investment,
contrary
to
the
expressed
requirements
of
congress
as
the
statutes
have
been
interpreted
by
the
courts,
that
he
receive
compensation
and
be
made
whole,
and
no
more.
so,
the
motion
that
the
ninth
circuit,
for
example,
has
advanced
that
tax
benefits
will
be
completely
recaptured
by
the
government,
the
government
will
get
all
its
money
back
in
some
sense,
is
just
false,
an
erroneous
statement
of
tax
law.
the
subsidy,
though,
is
something
worth
addressing
because
the
government
is
not
subsidizing
fraud.
the
government
is
subsidizing
a
motel.
the
motel
is
built
and
is
functioning.
i
believe
you
can
go
to
rochester,
minnesota
and
find
it
functioning
today.
the
government
has--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
how
to
take
that,
but--
[laughter]
the
motel
is
functioning.
carpenters
were
employed,
electricians,
plumbers,
masons,
road
pavers,
roofers,
whoever
makes
lumber,
two
by
fours,
in
the
pacific
northwest
have
this
factory
running
a
little
longer
to
help
finish
this
motel.
this
is
what
the
government
sought
to
bring
about.
this
is
what
was
brought
about
by
the
building
of
this
motel.
and
the
notion
that
the
government
is
somehow
entitled
to
any
measure
of
damages
now
to
get
back
some
of
that
money
is
preposterous.
that's
exactly
what
the
second
circuit
held.
they
phrased
it
this
way:
they
said,
the
government
is
not
banking
fraud,
which
was
the
expression
used
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
petitioners
today.
the
government
is
banking
exactly
what
it
agreed
to
bank,
which
is
a
type
of
economic
activity.
having
gotten
that,
i
used
the
word
"preposterous"
and
perhaps
"disingenuous"
would
be
a
better
word,
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
get
it
back.
the
subsidy
here
is
not
a
fraud.
injuries
caused
by
fraud,
dr.
austin's
$2,000
out
of
pocket
loss,
have
been
restored
to
him.
that
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
did.
there
was
no
subsidy
of
the
fraud.
now,
i
think
the
clearest
way
to
illustrate
this
point,
and
i
don't
want
to
beat
this
horse
to
death--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--well,
let
me
examine
that
very
scenario.
let's
suppose
that
at
the
outset
in
1973
the
petitioners
came
to
mr.
loftsgaarden
and
said,
we
wish
to
rescind,
take
back
our
units,
and
he
did,
and
return
them
each
for
$35,000
per
unit.
what
would
happen
then?
what
would
happen
is,
the
motel
would
have
been
built
and
all
the
tax
benefits
associated
with
it
would
have
gone
to
the
owner
of
the
units,
mr.
loftsgaarden.
he
would
have
received
the
tax
benefits,
not
the
petitioners.
an
that
is
the
same
economic--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
yes,
it
was
caused
by
the
investment,
induced
by
the
fraud,
that
is
correct.
i
don't
know--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--no,
they
weren't.
but
as
with
any
investment--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
government
has
suffered,
and
i
think
that's
a
vital
issue
here,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--but,
it
encouraged--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--it
may
not,
but
the
reason
it
may
not
is
because
it
sought
to
induce
a
kind
of
economic
activity
that
was
in
fact
induced,
and
brought
about.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
not
at
all,
not
at
all,
and
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
meant
when
it
said,
the
government
is
banking
exactly
what
it
agreed
to
bank.
all
the
deductions
and
tax
credits
that
led
to
the
tax
savings
by
the
investors
here
have
been
audited,
and
were
found
to
be
completely
proper.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
was
cheated
out
of
some
tax
revenues
it
otherwise
might
have
received.
the
fraud
went
only
to
the
incremental
investment
made
by
each
of
these
investors,
and
they
have
been
made
whole.
the
illustration
i
used,
which
invited
the
court
to
effect
this
rescission
in
1973,
i
think
shows
that.
the
economic
position
of
the
parties
would
have
been,
had
the
transaction
either
not
occurred
or
been
rescinded
right
away,
is
the
exact
economic
position
they
find
themselves
in
today
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
well,
they
do
have
a
financial
interest.
if
the
petitioners
were
awarded
$300,000
instead
of
20,000
some
odd
dollars,
there
would
be
more
money
to
tax,
and
some
of
those
tax
benefits
that
the
government
gave
out
would
come
back,
by
no
means
all
of
them,
but
some
would
come
back
despite
the
fact
that
what
the
government
sought
to
bring
about
by
granting
those
tax
benefits
has
occurred.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
if
the
award
was
increased,
yes,
they
would.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
well,
they
would
have
an
incentive
to
do
that,
yes.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
statutory
interpretation
argument
that
mr.
brunig
has
made
this
morning,
because
i
think
it
is
erroneous.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
and
by
no
means
abandoned
the
position,
that
the
nature
of
these
tax
benefits
is
properly
considered
as
a
restoration
of
consideration
paid
for
the
investment
by
the
investor.
i
won't
rehash
the
arguments
made
in
the
brief
because
i
want
to
address
the
income
point,
because
i
feel
that
if
the
investment
is
not
regarded
as
a
return
of
consideration,
it
must
be
treated
as
a
form
of
income.
and
i
think
as
a
result,
compelled
in
part
by
the
court's
decision
in
the
norfols
and
western
railway
case
in
which
the
court
decided
a
few
years
ago
that
in
determining
the
earnings
of
a
railwayman
killed
in
an
accident
for
the
purpose
of
awarding
his
wife
his
lost
earnings,
the
taxes
he
would
have
to
pay
must
be
deducted
like
any
other
costs
of
his
former
life
before
the
net
amount
was
determined.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
is
recognizing,
as
it
does,
that
the
payment
of
a
tax
liability
is
a
cost
to
be
subtracted
from
income
determining
net
amount,
that
it
follows
that
relief
from
a
tax
liability
is
properly
regarded
as
income,
at
least
in
an
economic
sense.
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
it's
taxable
income,
but
in
an
economic
sense
the
status
of
person
both
before
and
after
he
invested
in
a
tax
shelter
is
different.
tax
benefits
enhance
a
person's
wealth
by
reducing
his
taxes,
and
in
that
sense
constitute
economic
income
regardless
of
whether
it
constitutes
taxable
income.
indeed,
section
61
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
i
concede
is
not
strictly
applicable
here,
has
underlying
it
an
economic
principle.
it
says
that
the
forgiveness
or
release
of
indebtedness
constitutes
income.
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
yes.
yes,
it
can.
i
think
people
normally
think
of
increments
to
one's
wealth
as
income.
the
man
on
the
street
may
not--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--pardon?
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
they
are
a
form
of
income,
yes,
sir.
they're
not
the
same
as
earned
income,
obviously,
but--
mr.
john
m.
friedman,
jr.
--and
they
are
taxed
differently,
certainly.
but
from
an
economic
standpoint
they
can
be
a
return
on
investment
and
a
form
of
income
in
that
sense.
now,
i
think
if
we
stand
back
from
this
statute,
and
i'm
referring
here
to
section
12,
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
and
the
government
appears
to
agree
with
this
as
well
as
the
petitioners,
the
purpose
is
to
effect
a
rescission
and
restitution,
to
return
the
parties
to
the
status
quo
ante.
i
think
an
interpretation
of
income
which
closes
its
eyes
to
the
economic
necessities
in
achieving
that
end
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
word
"income"
in
the
statute,
and
unless
the
word
"income"
is
interpreted
to
include
all
the
economic
benefits
that
an
investor
receives
from
his
investment,
there
will
be
misconstruction
and
the
parties
will
not
be
returned
to
the
status
quo.
that
is
an
important
fact
in
the
statutory
interpretation
here.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
return
the
parties
to
the
status
quo
ante.
that
can't
be
done
unless
the
economic
benefits
received
from
the
investment
by
the
investors
are
taken
into
account.
the
court,
i
believe,
should
not
close
its
eyes
to
that
principle.
i
think
it's
easy
to
lose
sight
of
the
facts
of
this
case
before
the
court.
it
is
essentially
a
simply
case.
an
investment
was
made
benefits
were
returned
from
the
investment.
the
plaintiffs
have
been
made
whole.
they
have
the
same
amount
of
money
in
their
pockets
they
had
before
they
got
in
to
this
investment.
no
policy
requires
making
them
more
than
whole
in
the
face
of
statutes
whose
purpose
and
whose
limitation
is
to
avoid
actual
damages
or
compensation
on
account
of
the
acts
complained
of.
thank
you.
