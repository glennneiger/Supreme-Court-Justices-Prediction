we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
randall
against
loftsgaarden.
mr.
brunig,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.

mr.

chief

is
it
your
position
that
deterrence
is
not
one
of
the
functions
of
the
securities
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
deterrence,
by
implication,
embraces
the
idea
of
a
penal
sanction,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
terms
of
congressional
policy
in
antitrust
cases,
for
example,
you
have
a
trebling
of
damages,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
for
deterrence,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
nothing
expressed
in
the
securities
act
about
trebling
the
damages,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
suggest
that
this
large
amount
would
not
function
as
a
deterrent
with
respect
to
other
people
similarly
situated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
the
government
lose
anything
by
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
transaction
that
it
wouldn't
have
lost
if
the
transaction
had
not
been
accompanied
by--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
regard
that
as
income
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
regard
capital
gains
the
same
as
income?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they're
taxes
somewhat
differently,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
five
minutes
remaining,
mr.
brunig.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
