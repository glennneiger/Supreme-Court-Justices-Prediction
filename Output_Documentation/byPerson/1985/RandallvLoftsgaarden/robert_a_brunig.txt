mr.
robert
a.
brunig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
economic
benefits
if
any
which
flow
from
the
tax
deductions
available
to
a
defrauded
limited
partner
are
to
be
deducted
from
his
recovery
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
the
case
involves
two
specific
questions:
do
what
the
eighth
circuit
characterizes
as
tax
benefits
constitute
income
received,
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
12(2)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933;
and
secondly,
does
the
actual
damage
limitation
of
section
28
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
mandate
such
deduction.
we
would
argue
that
the
answer
to
all
of
those
questions
is
no.
i'd
like
to
speak
about
this
briefly
in
its
factual
context.
the
petitioners
here
bought
limited
partnership
associates
in
alotel
associates.
when
they
bought
it,
they
bought
it
based
on
an
offering
memorandum.
the
offering
memorandum
projected
losses
for
tax
purposes
in
1973
through
1975
which
ranged
from
slightly
above
$20,000
to
$476,
and
thereafter
taxable
income.
the
taxable
income
for
the
entire
period
through
1991
was
estimated
to
be
$96,000,
and
that
these
people
would
be
required
to
pay
taxes
of
over
$52,000
during
that
period.
instead,
they
got
something
else.
they
got
certain
tax
deductions
which
led
to
lesser
tax
payments
in
the
amounts
ranging
from
$29,000
to
slightly
more
than
$38,000
per
unit.
the
reason
that
they
got
greater
tax
benefits
was
because
b.
j.
loftsgaarden,
the
general
partner,
created
greater
losses,
either
operating
losses
or
greater
deductions
for
other
items
that
were
involved,
and
those
were
not
disclosed,
and
those
were
amounts
which
benefited
him
either
directly
or
indirectly
or
benefited
his
affiliates.
there
was
less
income,
in
addition,
because
for
example
the
motel
could
not
operate
as
it
was
anticipated.
sixty
of
159
rooms
were
not
able
to
be
occupied
whenever
it
rained
because
mr.
loftsgarden's
wholly
owned
corporation,
2361
building
corporation,
had
built
a
building
that
leaked
through
the
walls.
he
of
course
did
not
sue
himself
or
the
architects,
which
was
a
firm
of
which
he
was
a
30
percent
stockholder.
now,
to
take
that
along,
we
look
at
that
in
the
statutory
context,
and
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
the
first
question
to
be
looked
at
is
under
section
12(2)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
which
provides
that
any
person
in
a
similar
circumstance
may
recover
the
consideration
paid
for
the
security,
with
interest
thereon,
less
the
amount
of
any
income
received
thereon,
upon
the
tender
of
such
security,
and
it
offers
an
alternative
remedy
for
those
who
have
sold
their
securities,
that
is,
damages.
the
eighth
circuit
at
a
number
of
points
characterized
this
under
section
12(2)
as
a
damage
case.
it
is
not,
as
the
eighth
circuit
held
in
austin
one,
a
damage
case.
it
is
an
actual
rescission
case.
there
was
a
tender,
and
in
fact
the
formula
applies:
consideration
paid,
together
with
interest,
less
income
received.
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
what
is
called
tax
benefits
are
not
a
reduction
in
consideration
paid,
and
that's
logical
sense.
if
in
fact
a
person
bought
gasoline
for
his
or
her
automobile
and
used
it
for
business
purposes,
and
the
price
was
$10,
there
would
be
no
reduction
in
the
consideration
paid,
just
as
here
there
was
no
reduction
in
the
consideration
paid.
each
partnership
unit
had
the
consideration
of
$35,000.
respondents
asked
the
court,
despite
the
lack
of
a
counter-petition,
to
review
that
holding.
it
should
not,
both
because
it's
not
logical
and
because
it's
not
appropriately
before
the
court.
so,
the
case
then
goes
to,
do
in
fact
the
reductions
in
the
taxes
paid
by
these
individual
petitioners
constitute
income
received.
these
tax
benefits,
as
they
are
called,
are
not
such
income
received.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
first
of
all,
the
short
answer
is
yes.
every
investment
involves
tax
consequences,
whether
it
be
one
which
is
characterized
as
an
artificial
deduction,
or
any
other
deduction.
every
investment,
as
we
know,
has
tax
consequences
and
the
internal
revenue
code
imposes
those
tax
consequences.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
well,
every
investor,
including
these,
looked
on
this
as
an
opportunity
to
recover
a
profit
from
the
investment
and
to
have
certain
tax
consequences
flow
from
that
investment.
that's
true
of
every
investment.
but
to
look
to
the
benefit
of
the
bargain,
respondents
would
have
the
court
look
only
at
the
income
received
aspects
and
say,
well,
there
were
tax
benefits
which
flowed
from
it.
the
actual
bargain
is
one
which
would
have
provided
$96,000
in
taxable
income
over
a
period
of
time,
plus
calculable
appreciation.
if
we
are
to
look
at
this
as
a
benefit
of
the
bargain
case,
we
should
be
allowed
to
recover
the
entire
benefit
of
our
bargain.
at
the
time
of
the
investment,
that
projected
stream
of
income
had
a
valid...
and
we
are
not
being
allowed
to
recover
any
of
that,
and
if
we
were
allowed
to
we
would
be
more
than
happy
to
go
back
and
sue
for
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
because
we'd
get
much
more.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
that's
correct,
as
well
as--
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
--in
the
case
of
these
investors
it
provides
only
for
rescission.
if
they
had
in
fact
sold
the
securities,
they
might
get
damages
but
this
provides
only
for
rescission,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
10(b)
has
no
expressed
statutory
remedy.
it
has
a
limitation
on
a
damage
remedy
provided
by
section
28(a)
which
says
you
are
limited
to
actual
damages.
that
term
itself
is
not
described,
although
this
court
in
opinion
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
exchange
act
of
1934
had
considered
cases
in
which
actual
damages
were
involved,
the
l.
p.
larson
case,
for
example,
and
there
the
court
refused
to
consider
the
tax
consequences
under
actual
damages.
it
must
be
presumed
that
congress
was
aware
of
that.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
the
plaintiff
is
allowed
to
elect
after
the
jury
has
returned
a
verdict,
and
the
trial
court
in
this
case
under
12(2)
has
made
factual
findings.
the
litigant
may
choose
the
result
most
favorable
to
himself
or
herself.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
no,
that's
not
correct.
rescission
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court,
as
it
was
here,
and
the
trial
court
made
specific
written
findings
of
fact
with
regard
to
section
12(2).
the
10(b)-5,
the
state
securities
act
and
the
common
law
fraud
claims
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
trial
court
considered
the
result
of
the
answers
to
the
special
interrogatories
submitted
to
the
jury
in
making
his
own
findings,
but
he
made
much
more
extensive
findings
which
are
part
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
what
happened
was,
the
trial
court
said
that
the
result
was
the
same,
that
there
was
$35,000
per
unit
plus
interest
available
to
these
people.
the
trial
court
also
held
that
under
a
benefit...
out
of
an
out-of-pocket
measure
of
damages,
it
would
also
obtain
the
same
result
because
in
an
out-of-pocket
measure
it
would
have
the
price
paid,
less
the
value
of
the
security
at
the
date
of
the
discovery
of
the
fraud.
the
trial
court
held
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
discovery
of
the
fraud
the
securities
were
worthless,
and
because
they
were
worthless
you
get
the
same
amount
back,
that
is
$35,000
per
unit.
in
any
event,
when
we
talk
about
income
received,
the
respondent's
expert
at
the
time
of
the
retrial
testified
that
these
tax
benefits
were
in
fact
not
income.
the
internal
revenue
code,
both
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
securities
act
of
'33
and
the
exchange
act
of
'34
would
not
have
considered
what
are
characterized
as
tax
benefits
to
be
income
received.
this
court,
in
united
housing
foundation,
considered
what
we
have
here,
that
is,
tax
deductions
which
are
available
to
a
person
and
which
may
create
a
benefit
because
of
other
income
which
is
had,
as
not
being
income
or
profit
when
locking
at
the
definition
of
a
security
as
it
exists
in
section
2
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
and
said
it
was
not
income.
in
sum,
this
is
not
income
received.
now,
to
look
at
the
analysis
which
the
respondents
would
have
the
court
adopt,
they
would
say
that
you
look
first
to
section
10(b)
and
rule
10(b)-5,
and
the
limitation
imposed
by
section
28(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
which
limits
recovery
to
actual
damages.
and
they
say,
that
must
mean
economic
effect.
then,
they
would
have
the
court
construe
the
securities
exchange
act
in
pari
materia
with
the
securities
act
of
1933,
and
say,
because
the
standard
under
the
'33
act
is
negligence,
and
scienter
is
required
under
the
'34
act,
you
can't
get
a
greater
remedy.
we
believe
that
that
analysis
is
reversed,
and
it
should
go
to
the
express
remedy
created
by
congress
in
attempting
to
determine
what
congress
intended
as
the
measure
of
damages.
clearly,
the
legislative
history
says
that
the
person
is
to
get
his
or
her
money
back,
to
recover
his
or
her
purchase
price.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
tax
benefits
which
are
created
only
by
investors'
other
income,
there
are
no
tax
benefits
but
for
other
income.
one
of
the
problems
that
will
be
created
in
the
future
will
be
one
that
is
demonstrated
in
freschi
versus
grand
coal
venture.
what
happens
if
the
individual
investor
determines
that
the
deductions
which
are
shown
on
the
k-1
do
not
appear
to
be
appropriate,
and
doesn't
take
the
deduction
on
his
or
her
individual
income
tax
return?
is
he
then
to
be
faced
with
question
that
he
has
failed
to
mitigate
his
damages
by
taking
deductions
which
he
believed
to
be
fraudulent?
that
will
be
the
issue
to
arise.
we
believe
that
section
28(a)
does
not
impose
this
kind
of
question.
what
section
28(a)
does
is,
it
says
that
you
can't
get
identical
remedies
under
state
and
federal
law
and
have
two
recoveries
for
those,
and
double
up
your
recovery.
it
says
that
you
cannot
under
the
securities
exchange
act
obtain
punitive
damages.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
a
promoter
claims
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
use
the
federal
treasury
to
support
his
fraud,
and
to
reduce
his
damages.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
the
intent
of
the
federal
securities
laws
is
to
protect
the
investor,
and
to
deter
fraud
by
a
promoter.
that
is
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
including
president
roosevelt's
remarks.
in
any
event,
if
people
are
allowed
to
do
this,
the
more
money
that
they
bleed
from
the
limited
partnership
assets,
the
greater
the
tax
deductions
available
to
the
limited
partners
and
the
less
money
the
promoter
will
be
required
to
pay
to
the
defrauded
investor.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
counsel
would
say,
we
would
like
to
return
the
parties
to
the
status
quo
ante.
counsel
does
not
suggest
that
mr.
loftsgaarden
would
be
returned
to
the
status
quo
ante
and
required
to
disgorge
the
$70,000
which
he
paid
to
his
wholly
owned
corporation
as
rent
during
1973.
he
does
not
suggest
that
he
be
required
to
pay
the
in
excess
of
$100,000
which
the
partnership
paid
over
and
above
what
was
disclosed
as
the
cost
of
constructing
a
motel.
he
does
not
suggest
that
mr.
loftsgaarden
pay
the
$23,100
mortgage
commitment
fee
which
he
paid
to
property
development
research
company,
his
100
percent
owned
corporation,
or
the
$23,100
he
paid
to
lyman
colt,
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
alotel
associates.
he
does
not
suggest
that
mr.
colt
repay
the
undisclosed
$25,000
real
estate
commission
that
he
was
paid.
he
does
not
suggest--
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
loftsgaarden.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
mr.
loftsgaarden
got
all
the
money
to
which
he
was
entitled,
plus
a
great
deal
more.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
had
they
had--
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
--they
are
not
being
returned
under
the
present
status--
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
--because
as
was
the
testimony
of
petitioner
newmann,
for
example,
he
was
looking
at
a
variety
of
very
similar
deals,
all
of
which
would
have
provided
him
with
similar
tax
deductions,
similar
tax
benefits.
he
cannot
get
that
with
he
several
thousand
dollars
which
he's
being
awarded
under
the
eight
circuit's
holding,
because
he
would
have
had
both
the
tax
deductions
and
the
real
estate
investments.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
and
the
ultimate
profit,
the
capital
gain
on
the
apartment
buildings
in
which
he
had
invested
previously,
and
would
have
invested
at
this
time.
what
mr.
loftsgaarden
is
saying
is,
the
treasury
should
pay
out
the
$280,000
which
he
wishes
to
keep
and
would
otherwise
have
had
to
pay
back.
clearly,
if
these
people
had
not
had
other
income
from
other
sources,
these
would
have
been
no
tax
benefits
and
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
deduct
one
penny
from
the
recovery,
even
under
the
eighth
or
second
circuit
holdings.
but,
there
is
no
way
to
give
these
people
their
lost
investment
opportunity
back
again.
they
were
the
people
at
risk.
they
took
certain
risks,
and
mr.
loftsgaarden
imposed
unilaterally
other
risks
upon
them.
mr.
robert
a.
brunig
they
were
allowed
to
take
certain
deductions,
but
they
got
nothing
other
than
that.
part
of
the
deductions
were
obtained
in
a
different
way.
it
cost
real
dollars.
these
people
had
to
make
loans
to
the
partnership
which
they
were
not
allowed
to
recover
by
the
district
court,
because
the
district
court
held
that
they
had
learned
of
the
fraud
before
making
the
loan,
therefore
there
was
no
reliance
and
therefore
no
recovery.
so,
these
people
put
in
money
to
be
used
for
operating
capital
which
was
lost
because
of
the
fraud,
and
that
is
not
and
will
never
be
returned,
even
if
we
should
succeed,
and
certiorari
be
used
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
so,
that
money
is
lost.
these
people
were
required
to
make
those
loans
to
get
these
deductions.
it
was
real
money.
it
was
not
artificial
deductions.
to
answer
the
earlier
question,
would
there
be
some
recoupment
by
the
government,
certainly
the
mitigation
provisions
under
sections
1311
to
1314
allow
the
government
to
recoup
some
of
that
money,
because
when
the
status
is
changed
by
a
subsequent
judicial
decision
as
we've
noted
in
the
brief,
the
government
has
a
mechanism
available
in
addition
to
the
tax
benefit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
