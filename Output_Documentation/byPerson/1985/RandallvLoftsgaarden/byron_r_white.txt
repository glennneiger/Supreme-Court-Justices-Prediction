i
suppose
that
if
the
fraud
hadn't
taken
place
in
the
first
place
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
tax
savings?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
these
people
who
invested,
if
they
had...
they
probably
wouldn't
have
invested
if
they
had
known
what
they
should
have
known.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
they
may
have
acquired
a
tax
benefit
that
was
caused
by
the
fraud.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
clients
were
not
entirely
blameless
for
causing
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
government
suffered
from
the
tax
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
it
didn't
collect
these
taxes
from
these
investors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may
never
be
able
to
collect
then
from
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
the
united
states,
then,
has
a
financial
interest
in
this
case
at
all,
or
is
it
just,
they
think
this
would
be
a
sort
of
deterrent
way
of
enforcing
the
securities
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
united
states
would
stand
to
collect
some
more
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
about
the
relationships
between
the
investors
and
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
they
being...
are
their
relationships
being
returned
to
what
they
were
before,
the
investors'
relationship
to
mr....
what's
his
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
aren't
these
investors
being
returned
to
their
pre-deal
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
get
some
benefit
for
the
use
of
the
money,
for
the
money
that
was
returned
to
them?
