mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
tax
incentives
are
provided
by
congress
to
stimulate
certain
kinds
of
investment
or
economic
activity,
not
to
subsidize
securities
fraud.
that
is
basic
reason
why
we
submit
that
the
proper
approach
to
this
case
and
to
others
like
it
which
are
in
the
wings,
is
to
calculate
restitutionary
relief
or
other
damage
awards
under
the
securities
laws,
wholly
without
regard
to
the
tax
effects
of
the
securities
transaction
on
the
various
participants,
and
to
leave
the
further
tax
consequences
after
the
fraud
award
to
be
determined
between
the
internal
revenue
service
and
each
taxpayer,
under
principles
prescribed
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
approach
has
the
twin
virtues
of,
number
one,
preserving
without
diminution
both
the
deterrent
and
the
restitutionary
effects
of
the
statutory
remedies
against
securities
fraud,
and,
number
two,
allowing
the
tax
consequences
to
be
determined
by
the
normal
operation
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
under
our
annual
tax
accounting
system
that
will
provide
for
some
recapture
of
revenue
by
the
treasury
by
means
of
the
tax
benefit
rule
or
other
mechanisms,
and
it
will
further
assure
that
any
remaining
tax
benefits,
after
it
has
all
been
sorted
out,
will
rest
with
the
persons
upon
whom
congress
conferred
those
tax
benefits
rather
than
being
transferred
to
the
perpetrators
of
securities
frauds.
as
this
court
knows
from
its
1983
decision
in
hillsboro
national
bank,
it
can
be
a
complex
and
time
consuming
task
to
sort
out
the
tax
consequences
in
such
situations,
and
the
results
can
vary
depending
on
other
aspects
of
the
particular
taxpayer's
circumstances
in
the
taxable
years
at
issue.
but,
that
is
the
method
that
congress
and
the
courts
have
prescribed
for
applying
the
internal
revenue
code
to
interrelated
events
that
stretch
out
over
more
than
one
taxable
year.
the
fundamental
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
view,
in
this
case,
lies
in
its
attempt
through
strained
interpretation
of
the
statutory
terms
to
improve
upon
the
system
that
congress
has
prescribed
by
creating
an
unwieldy
amalgam
of
securities
law
and
tax
issues
to
be
resolved
up
front
in
the
fraud
suit.
it
is
a
bit
like
trying
to
solve
an
equation
containing
too
many
variables
without
any
firm
starting
point
in
doing
that,
and
the
danger
of
such
a
contrivance
is
that
it
distorts
the
results
ordained
by
each
statutory
scheme
and
thereby
undermines
the
statutory
policies
of
both
acts.
the
fact
that
the
eighth
circuit
here
and
the
second
circuit
have
disagreed
on
the
details
of
how
to
create
such
an
amalgam
is,
in
our
view,
merely
symptomatic
of
the
basic
error
of
undertaking
that
enterprise
in
the
first
place.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
both
courts,
of
undertaking
to
make
an
amalgamation
of
the
securities
issues
and
the
tax
issues
in
the
first
place
in
the
fraud
suit,
rather
than
applying
each
statute
on
its
own
terms
and
pursuant
to
its
own
processes
in
a
straightforward
way,
seriatim,
as
the
tax
law
provides
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
hanover
shoe
case
is
the
proper
approach
to
these
cases.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
perhaps
the
most
egregious
misinterpretation
of
this
statute
is
to
characterize
tax
benefits
as
income
of
an
amount
due
is
a
right
if
the
taxpayer
has
generated
other
income
through
his
labor
or
his
capital,
to
get
the
government
to
refrain
from
applying
as
much
tax
to
that
other
income
as
it
otherwise
would
apply.
but,
the
tax
benefit
is
not
the
income
itself
and
it
is
not
the
economic
activity
that
generates
income.
there
would
be
no
economic
activity
if
the
only
income
people
had
was
tax
benefits.
and
so,
we
believe
that
that
is
the
fundamental
error,
rather
than
of
the
detailed
differences
in
analysis
between
the
two
courts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
