is
it
possible,
mr.
brunig,
that
the
tax
benefit
features
of
a
particular
investment
might
be
part
of
a
bargained
for
exchange,
or
part
of
what
caused
the
investors
to
make
the
investment
in
the
first
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
they
have
a
market
value
in
the
mind
of
the
investor
such
as
would
affect
the
damages
recoverable
in
the
event
such
becomes
necessary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
case
i
guess
the...
your
clients
brought
the
action
under
both
section
10(b)
and
12(2)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
12(2)
provides
just
for
rescission?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
10(b)
provide
a
different
measure
of
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
when
the
two
sections
are
both
brought
into
the
picture,
then
is
it
up
to
the
plaintiff
to
select
which
measure
of
damages,
or
what
do
you
do?
are
you
limited
only
to
rescission
because
you've
combined
12(2)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
an
election
then
made
by
the
plaintiffs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
friedman,
do
you
know
to
what
extent,
if
a
rescission
is
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
securities
fraud
litigation,
that
irs
could
come
back
later
on
the
investor,
seeking
a
recoupment
of
some
of
the
tax
benefits
previously
taken?
