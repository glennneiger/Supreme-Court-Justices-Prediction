we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
board
of
governors
of
the
federal

mr.
bradfield,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

mr.
bradfield,
did
these
institutions
change
their
routine
practice
of
allowing
withdrawals
on
demand?

e.

did
they
change
their--
chief

--if
they
change
the
practice,
where
would
you
be
then?
without...
you
rest
quite
heavily
on
that.

then
it
wouldn't
be
like
an
ordinary

mr.
bradfield,
the
question
here
is,
of
course,
not
what
is
the
sensible
and
sound
thing
to
do.
we
could
concede
that
the
board
has
come
to
very
sensible
conclusions.
the
question
is
more
narrowly
whether
we
can...
whether
the
board
can
construe
the
statute
that
way.

nonaction,
nonaction
by
the
congress
is
hardly
a
very
weighty
consideration
with
the
courts.

thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
