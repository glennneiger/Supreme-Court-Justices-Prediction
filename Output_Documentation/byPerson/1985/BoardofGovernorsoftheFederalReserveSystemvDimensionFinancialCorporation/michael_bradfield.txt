mr.
michael
bradfield
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
federal
reserve
board
rule
applying
the
bank
holding
company
act
to
the
corporate
owners
of
certain
banks,
so-called
non-bank
banks.
the
bank
holding
company
act
applies
to
companies
that
control
a
bank,
which
the
act
defines
as
any
institution
that
both
takes
deposits
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand,
and
engages
in
the
business
of
making
commercial
loans.
the
first
part
of
this
definition
concerning
demand
deposit
was
added
to
the
act
in
1966,
substituting
for
a
broad
charter
test.
the
second
half
was
added
in
1970.
bank
holding
companies
may
engage
in
only
limited
activities;
owning
banks
and
in
activities
that
are
closely
related
to
banking.
the
act
prohibits
the
commingling
of
banking
and
commerce.
this
policy
was
adopted
to
prevent
abuses
in
the
allocation
of
credit;
to
prevent
concentration
of
banking
resources
in
a
few
hands;
and
to
maintain
local
control
over
local
banking
resources.
these
companies,
securities
firms,
insurance
firms,
retail
firms
and
other
commercial
and
industrial
companies
which
control
non-bank
banks,
claim
that
they
have
removed
themselves
from
the
regulation
under
the
act
when
they
act
through
national
banks,
state
banks
and
industrial
banks
to
provide
essential
banking
services
but
eschew
either
the
taking
of
demand
deposits
or
the
making
of
commercial
loans.
begnning
in
1980
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
in
the
number
of
institutions
that
use
this
device,
but
in
a
new
way;
to
achieve
interstate
banking
and
to
combine
banking
and
commerce.
the
board
became
concerned
that
these
institutions
which
took
now
accounts
and
made
commercial
loans
would
become
a
vehicle
for
preferential
lending
and
for
interstate
banking
in
violation
of
state
policy.
in
response,
a
unanimous
board
of
governors,
after
rulemaking,
defined
the
term
now
accounts.
mr.
michael
bradfield
that
was
a
suggestion
that
was
made
by...
the
board
took
the
position,
not
in
practice,
but
that
accounts
that
were
payable
by
check,
the
accounts
that
were
payable
on
demand
should
be
covered
by
the
act.
there's
a
bit
of
history
that
i
will
get
to,
justice
o'connor,
concerning
industrial
banks
and
their
proposal
and
the
board's
proposal
to
cover--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--the
board
actually
proposed
the
language
was
deposits
payable
on
demand.
that
language
later
became
deposits
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
payment
on
demand.
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
significance
to
that
change
in
language.
the
legislative
history
that
congress...
the
committee
reports
specifically
say
that
they
were
talking
about
demand
deposits
checking
accounts,
and
they
used
for
emphasis,
right
after
demand
deposits,
they
were
using
checking
accounts.
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
intended
any
specific
technical
distinction.
mr.
michael
bradfield
yes,
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
mr.
michael
bradfield
the
board's
definition
does
not
pick
up
savings
accounts.
it
doesn't
apply
to
savings
accounts,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
cover
savings
accounts--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--well,
technically
it's
possible
that
it
might
cover
that,
but
the,
the
specifics
of
the
definition
do
not
cover
passbook
savings
accounts
because
they're
not
payable
by
checks.
they
are
not
payable
by
third-party
means
attainment,
and
that's
the
essence
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
drive
at;
driving
at
those
instruments
that
were
money.
checks
are
money.
when
you
go
to
the
grocery
store,
you
give
the
clerk
a
check,
you
are
creating
money
at
that
point,
and
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about;
the
combination
of
that
characteristic
with
the
combination
of...
that
characteristic
with
commercial
lending.
and
when
the
two
are
combined,
congress
was
concerned
that
that
created
great
power
over
resources,
the
potential
for
preferential
lending,
and
that
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
that
and
wanted
to
prohibit
the
owners
of
banks
from
using
those
facilities
for
their
own
benefit.
mr.
michael
bradfield
this
is
because
in
practice...
there
are
two
aspects
of
that.
one
is
that
in
practice
the
notice,
it
is
not
practical
to
give
the
notice.
the
notice...
this
is
an
instrument
that
is
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
third
party.
when
passed
into
the
third
party
and
notice
is
given,
then
that
check
is
in
effect
dishonored
by
the
institution;
and
when
dishonored
by
the
institution,
it
completely
impairs
the
ability
of
the
institution
to
function
as
a
financial
institution.
mr.
michael
bradfield
i
don't...
first,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
and
point
out
that
congress
was
talking
about...
i
don't
think
they
were
making
that
technical
distinction.
congress
was
talking
about
what
was
a
commercial
bank,
characterized
a
commercial
bank.
that's
what
they
said
in
the
legislative
history.
they
were
driving
at
what
was
a
commercial
bank.
and
this
kind
of
instrument
that
creates
money
was
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
commercial
bank
that
they
were
driving
at.
and
they
clearly
didn't
mean,
when
you
look
at
the
whole
legislative
history
in
perspective,
they
clearly
didn't
mean
to
turn
on
one
technical
aspect,
to
be
able
to
undermine
the
whole
objectives
of
the--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--because
they
believe
that
that
was
the
equivalent
of
the
demand
deposit
language
that
was
already
in
board
regulations
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
bradfield
but
they
explained
that
in
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
technical
basis
for
concluding
that
they
intended
something
different.
they
looked
at
the
board
regulation
that
was
in
effect,
in
effect
since
1933,
and
what
the
board
had
then
defined,
and
defined
a
demand
deposit
as
any
instrument
that
was
subject
to
withdrawal
by
check...
by
check.
any
deposit
that
was
subject
to
withdrawal
by
check
was
a
checking
account
and
was
a
demand
deposit.
and
that
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
prevent
evasions
of
the
basic
prohibition
of
payment
of
interest
on
demand
deposits,
and
so
that
any
instrument
that
was
withdrawable
by
check
was
a
demand
deposit.
that
was
what
was
in
front
of
the
congress
in
1966
when
it
adopted
the
language.
now,
there
was
that
shift.
the
board
recommended
demand
deposit
in
its
recommendation
to
the
congress.
it
was
changed
to
deposit
that
the,
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand,
but
there's
no
basis
for
concluding
that
they
meant
in
that
technical
distinction
something
far
different.
and
i
would
add
to
that,
strengthen
that,
by
the
very
people
who
asked
for
this
change...
the
very
people
who
asked
for
this
change
were
the
industrial
bankers.
now,
they
said
we
do
not
offer
checking
accounts.
we
take
certificates,
savings
certificates;
and
we
don't
make
commercial
loans,
we
make
consumer
loans.
so,
we
don't
object
to
what
the
board
has
done
and
the
board
had
earlier
then
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
we
don't
object
to
what
the
board
has
done
with
respect
to
checking
accounts.
what
we
object
to
was
what
the
board
has
done
by
saying
that,
that
savings
accounts
that
are
in
practice
paid
on
demand
are
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
now,
that
is
what
congress
overturned.
and
they
overturned
that
in
a
very
narrow
way,
intending
to
exempt
industrial
banks
and
savings
banks,
but
as
far
as
congress
was
concerned,
did
not
have
any
kind
of
a
transactional
account
and
did
not
make
commercial
loans.
so,
they
were
completely
outside
the
scope
of
what
congres
was
worried
about.
mr.
michael
bradfield
a
now
account,
yes,
very
significantly
differs
because
it
has
a
transaction
capability.
what
those
accounts
that
i
was
talking
about
are
really
savings
accounts
in
which
you
need
a
passbook,
essentially
a
passbook;
there's
no
third-party
transaction
capability.
you
need
a
passbook,
you
have
to
go
to
the
institution
and
withdraw
your
money.
then
is
when
you
have
money.
in
the
case
of
a
transaction
account,
when
you
go
to
the
store
or
you
make
a
purchase,
then
you
have
money
when
you
actually
write
your
check.
and
that's
the
thing
that
congress...
that
was
the
essence
of
banking
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
and,
so,
those
two
characteristics,
the
ability
to
create
instruments
that
are
money
and
the
ability
to
make
commercial
loans,
those
were
the
characteristics
that
we're
worried
about.
and
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
that.
mr.
michael
bradfield
justice
o'connor,
you
make
a
very
excellent
point
that
has
been
strongly
made
on
the
side
of
the
respondents,
that
the
board's
rule
somehow
upsets
basic
industry
expectations,
and
i
think
i'd
like
to
take
a
minute
to
refute
that,
because
i
think
it's
just
simply
not
the
case.
first,
in
the
case
of
industrial
banks
we've
made
a
careful
survey
and
found
only
53
industrial
banks,
26
of
which
are
in
colorado,
which
in
fact
offer
now
accounts
and
make
commercial
loans.
so,
those...
out
of
about
1,200
industrial
banks
in
the
country,
only
that,
less
than
five
percent
would
be
covered
by
the
board's
regulation.
of
those
companies,
only
a...
we
don't
know
how
many,
but
not
all
of
those
53
are
owned
by
companies,
so
that
they
might
not
have
to
register
in
any
event.
mr.
michael
bradfield
that's
very...
that's
exactly
what
i
was
getting
to,
your
honor,
that
they--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--their
traditional
function
has
been
not
to
offer
now
accounts.
in
fact,
as
i
described
the
traditional
activity
has
been
to
offer
savings
certificates
and
making
consumer
loans,
and
if
they
just
simply
went
back--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--well,
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
i
rest
very
heavily
on
that
because
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
when
they
do
offer
now
accounts,
when
they
do
make
the--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--so
then
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
we
wouldn't
be
worried.
it's
possible
that
we
ought
to
be
worried
about
it,
and
it
would
be
up
to...
and
then
it
would
be
up
to
congress
to
change
that.
but
that
is
not
covered
at
this
time
in
the
board's
regulations.
we're
worried
about
the
combination
of
now
accounts,
money
and
commercial
loans,
which
these
institutions,
these
50-off
institutions
actually
engage
in
now.
there's
another
class
of
institutions,
which
is
the
privately
insured
s&ls,
and
that
industry
which
did
very
recently
and
very
rapidly
like
the
industrial
banks,
those
institutions
have
recently
gone
into
now
accounts
and
commercial
loans.
and
as
i
think
all
the
court
is
aware,
that
industry
has
essentially
been
destroyed
by
the
events
in
ohio
and
maryland.
they
were
originally
participants
in
this
case
and
have
withdrawn
from
this
and
no
longer
oppose
the
board's
rule.
and
the
fact
that,
the
very
reason
that
a
number
of
them
got
into
trouble
is
because
they
weren't
subject
to
regulation.
their
owners
were
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
institutions,
make
preferential
loans,
take
the
now
accounts
and
other
deposits
that
they
had,
make
favorable
commercial
loans,
and
they
effectively
destroyed
their
institutions
and
destroyed
those
other
institutions
that
were
associated
with
them.
the
last
class
of
institutions
that
are
subject
to
this
are
the,
are
the
new
non-bank
banks.
those
are
the
national
banks
that
have
been
recently
chartered
which,
which
take...
would
like
to
be
able
to
take
now
accounts
and
make
full
commercial
loans.
and
they
had
full
notice
about
the
board's
proposed
regulations,
the
very
recent
development.
they,
too,
could
conform
their
activities
by
giving
up
the
<now>
[=
now]
accounts.
and
so
that,
as
far
as
some
great
revolution
is
concerned
in
the
banking
industry,
there
is
no
such
great
revolution.
what
the
board's
regulation
does
is
effectively
preserve
the
industry
the
way
congress
intended
it
would
be
with
the
separation.
what
would
happen
is
that
there
would
be
massive
evasions
of
this
basic
congressional
intention,
which
goes
way
bank
in
our
history.
this
emphasis
on
avoiding
the
combination
of
banking
and
commerce
goes
way
bank
in
our
history,
and
if
we
did
not
have
that,
i
think
you
would
have
a
very
great
and
major
change.
another
argument
that
is
made
is
somehow
that
the
board's
regulation
steps
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
other
federal
banking
agencies,
and
that
again
is
simply
not
true.
the
board's
regulation
only
regulates
the
owners
of
banks.
it
does
not
in
any
way
regulate
banks
or
industrial
banks
in
any
way.
mr.
michael
bradfield
there
are
some
who
have
expressed
disagreement.
for
example,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
expresses
a
specific
agreement
with
the
regulation,
and
there's
a
letter
attached
to
our
reply
brief
from
the
home
loan
bank
board
indicating
that.
another
of
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
disagrees
with
us
as
a
policy
matter
but
it
doesn't
disagree
with
us
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
are
numerous...
for
example,
the
conference
of
state
bank
supervisors,
in
a
group
that
represents
all
of
the
banking
regulators
in
the
states,
they
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
which
fully
supports
the
board--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--i
didn't
mean
a
poll,
your
honor,
either.
i
was
pointing
out
that,
that
there,
that
certainly
there
isn't
unanimity.
but
the
board
is
the
expert
in
this
area;
that
congress
deliberately
gave
to
the
board.
it
had
other
choices
as
to
organizing
the
bank
holding
company
act;
organizing
administration
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
but
the
board,
the
congress
specifically
gave
this
to
the
board,
and
the
board
has
the
expertise
in
this
area.
the
board
carefully
considered
all
of
these
comments
from
the
other
agencies,
from
private
parties,
and
after
a
formal
rule...
an
informal
rulemaking,
carefully
considered
in
a
more
than
40-page
opinion,
analyzed
all
these
comments
and
in
a
reasoned
opinion
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
regulation
is
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
prevent
evasions
of
the
act,
both
powers
which
congress
has
given
to
the
board.
mr.
michael
bradfield
it...
the
regulation...
let
me
start
by
saying
that
the
statute
uses
a
very
general
term,
"commercial
loan".
mr.
michael
bradfield
making
commercial
loans,
and
clearly
if
you're
a
business
and
you
are
in
the
business
of
accepting
commercial
paper
against
your
deposits,
why
that
is
certainly
a
commercial
loan.
if
you
do
it
once
a
week
or
you
do
it
twice
a
week,
it
is
certainly
in
the
business.
now,
i
don't
have
any
question,
and
i
don't
think
the
board
had
any
question
that
an
institution
that
engages
in
those
practices
would...
was
in
the
business
of
making
commercial
loans.
now,
i
imagine
there
could
be
such
circumstances
where
you
did
one
such
transaction
a
year,
and
i
think,
then,
your
point
would
be
well
taken.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
was
addressed
to
that.
this
was
addressed
to
the
situation
where
an
institution
regularly...
and
i
think
that
that's
what's
necessary
for
a
depository
institution...
it
regularly
engages
in
this
kind
of
activity;
commercial
paper,
banker's
acceptances,
cds.
those
all
are
loans
from
one
business
to
another.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
congress...
this
is
a
very
important
point...
that
in,
in
adopting
that
commercial
loan
test,
that
congress
thought
it
was
exempting
a
single
trust
company.
it
didn't
know
anything
about
its
activities
other
than
that
which
that
entity
represented
to
the
congress,
and
that
was
that
it
was
a
fiduciary
institution,
a
trust
company
and
primarily
engaged
in
fiduciary
activities.
and
the
house
conferees,
in
their
manager's
report,
said
specifically
that
that
provision
should
be
narrowly
construed
as
well
as
other
specific
exemptions
that
were
then...
like,
for
example,
the
grandfather
clause.
that
clause,
and
this
clause
on
commercial
lending,
where
there
was
a
specific
injunction
that,
that
that,
uh,
that
that
exception,
the
commercial
lending
exception,
be
narrowly
construed;
the
specific
statutory
language...
not
statutory...
specific
legislative
history
that
covers
that.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
board
has
the
independence
of
judgment
and
a
broad
perspective
gained
from
its
responsibilities
for
monetary
policy
and
for
the
regulation
of
the
banking
industry.
it's
the
country's
central
bank.
it
regulates
the
money
supply.
it's
the
lender
of
last
resort;
the
regulator
of
the
payment
system,
and
a
regulator
of
over
a
thousand
member
bank.
the
point
is
that,
that
these
broad
responsibilities
give
the
board
a
perspective
and
a
special
expertise
in
administering
the
act.
the
board
used
this
expertise
in
the
case
before
you.
it
engaged
in
detailed
rulemaking.
it
carefully
analyzed
the
facts
and
articulated
the
reasons
for
its
conclusions,
and
in
a
comprehensive
and
thoroughly
reasoned
opinion
concluded
that
those
definitions
are
necessary
to
carry
out
the
act's
purposes
of
separating
banking
and
commerce.
this
is
clearly
a
case
in
which
the
doctrine
of
administrative
deference
is
applicable.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
your
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
michael
bradfield
--well,
if
i
may
just
offer
as
the
reasons
for
that
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
one
that
the
board's
definition
fit
the
literal
language
of
the
act.
the
now
account
is
an
instrument
that
is
payable
on
demand.
the
statute
doesn't
say
notice,
and
so
that
it
is
an
instrument
that
is
payable
on
demand.
the
instruments
that
the
board
defined
as
commercial
loans
are
commercial
loans.
it's
a
broad
term,
and
the,
and
the
board
clearly
has
the
discretion
to
give
that
term
meaning.
there
is
no
rigid
industry
definition.
it
is
the
board
that
is
responsible
for
giving
that
term
a
definition.
and
the
third
point
is
that
the
board
has
broad
power.
the
statute
specifically
said
the
board
is
charged
with
administering
the
act,
carrying
out
its
purposes,
and
preventing
evasions.
now,
that...
we're
not
asking
in
this
case,
saying
that
that
is
the
sole
authority.
we
fit
within
the
legislative
language.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
those
two
provisions
were
intended
to
be
narrowly
construed.
you
combine
those
two,
two
elements,
narrow
construction
and
literal
language,
together
with
the
broad
authority
of
the
board
to
prevent
evasions.
and
this
court
has
held
that
where
that
kind
of
broad
authority...
and
it
isn't
usually
given...
where
you
have
that
kind
of
broad
authority,
then
in
that
case
you
can
even
go
beyond.
in
mourning
v.
family
publications,
this
court
said
you
can
even
go
beyond
the
literal
coverage
of
the
statute
in
order
to
accomplish
an
objective,
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
underlying
objective
of
the
statutory
purpose.
now,
when
you
have
those
three
elements,
i
think
you
clearly,
and
you
have
an
expert
agency,
it's
clearly
a
matter
for
administrative,
to
give
deference
to
an
administrative
agency.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
bradfield
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
start
by
pointing
out
that
the
basic
approach
that
congress
has
had
to
this
whole
question
of
bank
holding
company
activities
is
that
the
combination
of
ownership
by
industrial
and
commercial
firms
of
banks
is
just
to
fraught
with
the
potential
for
abuse
to
be
permitted.
the
alternative
of
permitting
such
combinations
but
subjecting
them
to
careful
regulations
was
rejected,
was
considered
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
congress.
it
had
decided,
instead,
that
only
a
complete
divorce
is
workable.
overturning
the
board's
rule
would
permit
this
incompatible
marriage
to
take
place,
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress.
so,
rather
than
the
board
extending
its
jurisdiction,
the
board
is
simply
implementing
what
congress
already
intended
in
1956
and
1966
and
in
1970.
if
you
take
that
approach
and
then
you
look
at
the
respondents'
representations
that
they
are
just
small
consumer
organizations,
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question
whether
the
industrial
banks
and
dimension
are
small
consumer
organizations,
and
you
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question
that
they
are...
they
may
be
today,
but
will
they
be
tomorrow?
if
they
have
this
authority
to
combine
now
accounts
and
commercial
loans,
full
commercial
loans,
won't
they
be
able
to
use
this
authority
in
a
way
that's
precisely
the
way
that
congress
said
it
shouldn't
be
used.
now
accounts,
i
should
remind
you,
are
a
very
major
portion
of
our
money
supply.
there's
over
171
billion
in
now
accounts;
larger
than
currency
in
circulation,
and
almost
as
large,
65
percent
of
the
amount
of
demand
deposits.
now
accounts
are
money,
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
regulate.
the
respondents
suggest
that
nothing
bad
is
going
to
happen
as
a
result
of
allowing
this
trend
to
continue.
congress
knew
that
that
was
possible.
they
considered
that,
and
i
can
only
cite
to
you
exactly
what
happened
in
maryland
and
ohio
as
examples
of
what
bad
things
can
happen
and
how
the
system
can
be
destabilized
by
this
kind
of
development.
i'd
like
to
also
point
out
that
the
charge
has
been
made
there
is,
that
there
is
a
common
usage
with
respect
to
commercial
loans.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
be
confused
by
the
term
money
market
instrument,
as
if
there's
some
kind
of
independent
market
in
which
buyers
and
sellers
congregate
and
there
are
independent
transactions.
justice
stevens
was
exactly
correct
that
if
a,
a
commercial
bank
buys
a
loan
from
another
commercial
bank
it
has
made
a
commercial
loan,
and
if
there's
a
problem
with
that
loan
it
is
responsible
and
has
to
engage
in
direct
face-to-face
negotiations
with
the
other
party
in
order
to
straighten
things
out.
similarly,
broker
car
loans,
a
direct
face-to-face
negotiation.
certainly
commercial
paper;
most
commercial
paper,
more
than
50
to
60
percent,
more
than
half
of
commercial
paper,
is
directly
negotiated
between
the
borrower
and
the
lender.
there's
a
suggestion
that,
that
the,
that
the
congress
to
repudiate
the
board
and
the
board's
definitions
in,
when
the
board
initially
covered
industrial
banks
in
1963.
well,
that's
hardly
a
conclusion
that
you
can
draw
from
the
record.
in
1958
the
board
made
20
recommendations
on
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
how
the
bank
holding
company
act
should
be
improved.
the
congress
adopted
every
one
except
one
with
just
a
minor
provision
of
not
great
significance.
i
would
finally
point
out
that
the
notice
requirement
that
the
respondents
on
now
accounts...
the
notice
requirement
that
they
propose
would,
is
just
sufficient
to
take
an
instrument,
the
now
account,
from
outside
the
bank
holding
company,
if
there's
notice,
it's
enough...
if
that
were
true,
any
bank
holding
company,
the
largest
bank
holding
company
could
simply
put
a
notice
on
its
accounts
and
simply
escape
from
the
bank
holding
company
act.
that
was
considered
in
a
fifth
circuit
decision
and
was,
that
kind
of
situation
was
said,
that's
an
evasion
of
the
act
and
it
should
be
an
evasion
of
the
act
here
as
well.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
while
these
respondents
claim
to
be
small
and
of
not
great
significance
in
doing
great
public
good,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
on
page
1a
of
the
appendix
is
a
list
of...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
