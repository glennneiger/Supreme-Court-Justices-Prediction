mr.
bradfield,
justice
rehnquist
emphasized
the
word
"legal
right"
in
dealing
with
deposits,
and
i
was
also
interested
in
your
comments
on
the
second
statutory
requirement,
and
particularly
the
word
"making",
in
the
business
of
making
commercial
loans.
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
regulation
expands
that
concept
rather
dramatically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
davidson,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
a
bank
does
make
a
big
loan
to
a
manufacturer;
a
million
dollar
loan.
and
then
after
it's
partially
paid
off,
the
bank...
another
bank
purchases
that
loan
from
the
first
bank.
has
the
second
bank
made
a
commercial
loan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
realize
it's
a
commercial
loan.
has
the
second
bank
made
a
commercial
loan,
in
your
view?
