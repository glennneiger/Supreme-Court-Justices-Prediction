mr.
bradfield,
in
1966
when
congress
was
considering
adopting
the
definition,
did
the
board
propose
to
congress
that,
in
defining
demand
deposits,
that
it
include
accounts
which
in
actual
practice
were
paid
on
demand?
was
that
a
suggestion
made
by
the
board
to
congress
in
'66?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
my
concern
is
to
determine
whether
it
be
the
essence
of
the
present
board
rule
and
position
was
one
that
was
suggested
by
the
board
itself
to
congress
in
1966
and
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
somewhat
formalistic
language
by
the
congress
that
rejected--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
can
we
say
in
concluding
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
pick
up
passbook
savings
accounts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
tell
me
whether
you
think
literally
the
board's
new
definition
of
a
now
account
is
broad
enough
to
pick
up
passbook
savings
accounts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
literal
language
of
the
board's
new
definition
cover...
is
it
broad
enough
to
conceivably
cover
passbook
savings
accounts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bradfield,
if
your
position...
if
the
board's
position
with
its
new
definition
of
now
accounts
is
invalid,
do
i
understand
that
it
would
then,
it
would
be
required
that
some
industrial
loan
companies
go
out
and
purchase,
try
to
purchase
fdic
insurance,
which
for
other
technical
reasons
they
would
not
be
able
to
do?
are
we
going
to
have
a
hiatus
in
the
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
davidson,
now
the
board's
new
definition
of
commercial
loan
seems
to
boil
down,
basically,
to
saying
that
it
covers
any
extension
of
credit
between
two
parties
where
neither
is
a
consumer,
and
that
strikes
me
as
perhaps
consistent
with
the
broad
general
term
commercial
loan,
which
congress
did
not
choose
to
define
very
specifically.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
some
of
these
other
items
that
are
included
in
the
definition?
