justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bradfield,
if
you
turn
to
page
2
of
your
petition
for
certiorari,
and
you
probably
have
this
material
at
hand
without
turning
to
it,
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
definition
in
1841(c),
that
a
bank
means
any
institution
which
accepts
deposits
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
and
then,
if
you
look
right
below
below
it
to
the
regulation,
the
regulation
comes
along
and
says
deposits
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand
means
any
deposit
that,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
is
payable
on
demand.
now,
i...
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
being
within
what
congress
was
talking
about.
congress
says
you
have
to
have
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand,
and
the
board
says
no,
it's
just
a
practical
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
perhaps
that's
a
sensible
answer
to
my
question,
but
i
had
intended
to
get
at
another
point.
it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
me
when
congress
has
said
that...
they're
talking
about
deposits
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
and
then
the
board
comes
along
and
says
this
language
that
congress
means,
means
any
deposit
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
is
payable
on
demand.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
significant
alteration
of
congress'
meaning.
congress
was
talking
in
pretty
strict
terms
about
the
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why,
then,
did
they
use
the
rather
technical
language
"has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand?
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
yet,
they
didn't
take
the
board
regulations,
they
took
this
much
stricter
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does...
does
a
now
account
really
differ
significantly
from
the
kind
of
account
you
just
referred
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
other
agencies
have
expressed
disagreement
with
the
board's
regulation,
have
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
wasn't
taking
so
much
of
a
poll
of
all
the
affected
parties
as
the
fact
that
perhaps
other
federal
agencies
who
disagree
might
suggest
that
your
construction
of
federal
law
might
be
mistaken
in
a
way
that
it
wouldn't
be
if
they
didn't
disagree.
