mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
a
group
of
petitioners
whose
primary
concern
is
with
the
commercial
loan
aspect
of
the
board's
new
definition
bank
in
regulation
y.
counsel
who
will
speak
after
me
represents
the
group
of
petitioners
who
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
demand
part
of
that
definition.
with
respect
to
the
commercial
loan
aspect
of
the
definition,
i
wanted
to
discuss
two
points
with
the
court
this
afternoon.
first,
that
the
board's
new
regulation
seeks
to
expand
the
bank
holding
company
act
beyond
the
entire
area
of
business
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
with
that
statute.
and
second,
that
the
board's
new
definition
of
commercial
loan
is
contrary
to
common
usage
and
to
congressional
intent
and
therefore
cannot
be
justified
on
the
grounds
of
agency
deference
or
its
evasion
authority.
on
the
first
point,
the
statute...
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history,
and
i
think
just
as
indicated
by
counsel
for
the
board,
shows
that
the
bank
holding
company
act
is
a
statute
designed
for
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking.
it
does
so
by
authorizing
the
board
to
regulate
companies
which
own
or
control
subsidiaries
that
are
commercial
banks.
now,
commercial
banks
are
institutions
which
accept
deposits
which
commercial
enterprises
are
eligible
to
maintain,
in
other
words
corporate
checking
accounts,
and
which
engage
in
the
business
of
lending
those
deposits
back
to
businesses
in
the
form
of
commercial
loans.
the
board's
briefs
to
this
court
have
stressed
the
importance
of
both
aspects
of
those
defining
characteristics
of
the
business
of
commercial
banking.
in
the
board's
original
brief,
the
board
has
pointed
out
that
corporate
checking
accounts
typically
constitute
a
very
substantial
proportion
of
the
total
demand
aspect
of
demand
deposits
of
a
commercial
bank.
and
in
the
board's
reply
brief,
the
board
argues
that
the
foremost
obligation
of
a
commercial
bank
is
to
supply
the
credit
needs
of
business
enterprises
in
its
community.
now
there
are,
and
there
always
have
been,
other
kinds
of
providers
of
financial
services
which
are
not
engaged
in
the
business
of
commercial
banking
as
that
term
has
indicated.
prominent
among
them
are
institutions
that
are
more
consumer
oriented,
which
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
providing
financial
services
to
individuals,
including
the
service
of
consumer
lending.
now,
one
key
example
is
the
whole
category
of
industrial
banks,
and
as
the
court
brief
itself
notes,
industrial
banks
historically
are
consumer-oriented
institutions
which
serve
industrial
workers
and
similar
customers
who
can't
obtain
credit
from
commercial
banks.
and
there
still
is
a
need
for
such
commercial
banks
today,
and
that's
precisely...
such
consumer
banks
today...
and
that
is
precisely
why
the
comptroller
found
that
the
dimension
proposal...
and
respondent
mentioned
financial
corporation
here
before
the
court...
to
open
consumer-oriented
national
banks
not
engaged
in
the
business
of
commercial
banking
was
warranted
by
the
needs
of
the
local
communities
where
dimension
seeks
to
operate.
in
light
of
some
of
the
comments
which
we
have
heard
this
afternoon,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
these
consumer
banks,
and
for
that
matter
their
affiliates,
are
regulated
to
insure
their
safety
and
soundness;
some
of
them
by
the
states,
some
of
them,
like
the
proposed
dimension
banks,
by
federal
agencies
like
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
existence
of
consumer
banks
or
the
fact
that
they
are
supervised
under
regulatory
regimes
apart
from
the
particular
one
which
is
here
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
bank
holding
company
act,
has
ever
posed
a
threat
to
the
soundness
of
this
nation's
financial
structure
or
the
banking
industry
in
general.
that
is
the
view
of
other
government
agencies
which
have
been
expressed
to
this
court
in
this
case,
which
are
as
equally
concerned
as
the
board
with
the
soundness
of
the
nation's
financial
structure
and
banking
system.
and
that's
the
conclusion
of
a
major
empirical
study
published
this
year,
performed
by
the
staff
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
chicago.
and
i
might
note
that
the
same
arguments
which
the
board
makes
here,
in
its
briefs
and
in
oral
argument,
are
the
same
argument
it
has
been
making
to
congress
for
the
last
few
years,
and
congress
itself
has
not
perceived
the
need
for
any
particular
emergency
here
and
sought...
thought
that
it
was
necessary
to
expand
the
definition
of
bank
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
in
the
manner
in
which
the
board
now
seeks
to
accomplish
through
its
regulation.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
i'm
not
suggesting
that
nonaction
by
congress
is
a
mechanism
by
which
to
interpret
the
statutory
language.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
board's
arguments
to
the
court
that
are
basically...
there's
something
bad
about
to
happen
to
the
banking
industry,
there
is
some
emergency
situation
that
compels
the
board
to
step
in
and
to
expand
the
scope
of
its
jurisdiction...
is
undercut
by
the
fact
that
those
same
arguments
have
been
made
to
congress
and
that
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
act
to
give
the
board
that
authority.
but
when
we
turn
to
the
specific
issue
of
statutory
construction,
then
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
on
what
congress
has
done,
i
would
agree,
as
to
what
congress
has
not
done.
and
i
believe
that
the
bank
holding
company
act--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--i
think
that
the
important
point
to
think
about
in
terms
of
the
commercial
loan
language
that
congress
put
into
the
statute
with
the
1970
amendment
is
that
the
commercial
loan
language,
at
that
time
the
term
commercial
loan,
is
a
phrase
of
common
usage.
it
has
a
commonly
understood
meaning
in
the
banking
industry.
and
at
that
time,
in
1970
when
congress
put
that
phrase
into
the
statute,
and
for
that
matter
to
this
day,
the
term
commercial
loan,
as
a
matter
of
common
usage,
excludes
money
market
and
inter-bank
transactions
which
financial
institutions,
including
banks,
use
for
day-to-day
asset,
liability
or
liquidity
management.
it's
a
fact
that
money
market
and
inter-bank
transactions
are
distinct
from
what
people
commonly
understand
by
the
term
commercial
loan,
and
indeed
have
different
characteristics
from
commercial
loans
is
something
that
has
been
demonstrated
in
a
long
string
of
board
decisions--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--the
only...
the
things
that
the
board
has
included
in
the
definition
of
commercial
loan
which
we
are
challenging
is
the
money
market
and
inter-bank
transactions;
commercial
paper,
banker's
acceptances,
broker
car
loans,
purchase
and
sale
of
federal
funds,
and
so
forth.
those
are
instruments
which
banks
use
for
day-to-day
liquidity
purposes
and
are
not
within
the
commonly
understood
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
commercial
loan.
that
is
something
that
the
board
itself
concluded
over
a
course
of
many
years
in
looking
at
those
specific
transactions
and
concluding
that
they
were
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
commercial
loan
as
intended
by
congress
when
it
put
those
terms
into
the
statute.
that's
the
real
significance
of
the
series
of
board
decisions.
it
also
represents
the
views
of
other
government
agencies
which
have
been
expressed
to
this
court,
who
are
certainly
familiar
with
banking
transactions
and
banking
terminology.
it's
also
consistent
with
the
comments
of
the
federal
reserve
banks.
i
realize
that
all
that
has
been
set
forth
before
in
our
briefs.
what
i
think
i
would
like
to
add
in
the
oral
argument,
however,
is
that
that
same
common
usage,
same
common
understanding,
runs
right
through
the
text
cited
by
the
board
in
their
reply
brief.
the
board,
in
their
reply
brief,
cites
as
their
prominent
text
that
they
rely
on
this
book,
management
policies
for
commercial
banks,
the
cross
and
hemphill
text,
to
support
their
proposition
which
they
quote,
include
the
quotation
that
loans
can
supply
the
credit
needs
of
business
enterprises
in
whatever
form
of
commercial
loans.
it's
interesting,
that
quotation
appears
in
a
chapter
in
the
book
on
bank
lending,
which
begins
with
a...
the
chapter
begins
with
actually
the
book
drawing
a
sharp
distinction
between
loans,
bank
loans,
and
other
kinds
of
transactions
that
banks
engage
in
for
day-to-day
liquidity
purposes.
it's
a
separate
chapter
of
that
book
which
discusses
those
kinds
of
transactions
and
how
they
are
different,
and
enumerates
the
instruments
that
banks
use
for
day-to-day
liquidity
purposes
as
including
federal
funds,
commercial
paper,
banker's
acceptances
and
negotiable
cds
issued
by
other
banks.
as
this
book,
as
this
text
points
out
and
as
the
prior
decisions
of
even
the
board
and
its
staff
has
pointed
out,
these
kinds
of
transactions
basically
do
not
involve
the
same
kind
of
borrower-lender
relationship.
and
if
one
tracks
through
each
of
the
three
elements
of
commercial
loans
that
congress
put
into
the
statute
in
1970...
in
other
words,
that
it
be
a
loan,
that
it
be
a
loan
to
a
commercial
enterprise,
and
that
the
business
be
engaged
in
the
business
of,
the
enterprise
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
making
the
commercial
loan...
each
one
of
these
can
be
analyzed
and
you
can
see
why
the
term
of
these
particular,
why
the
nature
of
the
particular
money
market
or
inter-bank
transaction
does
not
fall
within
what
people
have
commonly
understood
to
constitute
a
commercial
loan.
for
those
reasons
we
believe
that
because
the
congress
inserted
language
into
the
statute
which
had
common
meaning
at
the
time
and
which
the
board
thought
was
self--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
--certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
assumes
the
second
one?
sir,
i
believe
that
when
we
have
a
situation
wherein
one
bank
assumes
the
commercial
loan
entered
by
another,
that
that
could
very
well
be
a
commercial
loan.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
davidson
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
situation
of
making
a
commercial
loan
unless
one
could
indicate
that
there
would
be
some
transfer
of
funds
from
the
second
bank
to
the
original
borrower.
in
that
case,
which
i
suppose
could
happen
in
some
situation
where
the
loan
would
be
refinanced
or
there
would
be
some
new
relationship
that
would
involve
some
face-to-face
dealings
and
a
negotiation
of
terms
of
the
new
loan
assumption,
you
might
be
able
to
say
that
there
was
enough
face-to-face
relationship
there
to
say
that
there
was
a
making.
but,
apart
from
that,
i
would
suggest
no.
for
those
reasons
and
for
the
reasons,
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
the
board
has
exceeded
the
language
of
the
statute
and
congress'
basic
intent,
not
only
with
the
commercial
loan
amendment
in
particular
but
with
the
whole
scope
and
what
it
seeks
to
regulate
under
the
bank
holding
company
act.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
no
amount
of
agency
deference
or
deference
to
the
agency's
evasion
authority
can
justify
the
board
in
doing
something
which
is
to
expand
its
jurisdiction
in
a
manner
that
congress
did
not
intend
and,
indeed,
is
contrary
to
specific
limitations
on
that
jurisdiction
that
congress
put
into
the
statute
when,
for
example,
it
amended
the
act
to
include
the
commercial
loan
provision.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
tenth
circuit.
thank
you.
