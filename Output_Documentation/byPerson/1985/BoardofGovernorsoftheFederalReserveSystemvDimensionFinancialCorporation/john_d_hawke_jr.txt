mr.
john
d.
hawke,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
that
i
wish
to
address
is
the
validity
of
the
board's
attempt
in
this
case
to
expand
the
bank
holding
company
act
jurisdiction
to
cover
industrial
banks
by
the
means
of
redefining
a
statutory
term
relating
to
so-called
demand
deposits.
industrial
bank
is
the
name
that
is
given
to
a
variety
of
small
financial
institutions
chartered
under
state
law
principally
to
provide
installment
credit
to
consumers
and
to
small
businesses.
according
to
data
recently
submitted
to
congress
by
the
federal
reserve,
industrials
currently
operate
in
about
20
states;
there
are
about
1,200
of
them
in
the
country
in
existence;
and
their
total
deposits
are
only
about
five
billion
dollars.
industrials
typically
offer
two
types
of
deposit
accounts,
savings
deposits
and
investment
certificates.
virtually
all
states
that
authorize
industrials
prohibit
them
from
offering
true
demand
deposits;
that
is,
deposits
as
to
which
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
ten
states,
however,
currently
authorize
industrials
to
permit
withdrawals
from
savings
accounts
by
negotiable
instrument.
approximately
95
industrials,
according
to
the
board's
information,
offer
so-called
now
accounts,
although
i
should
say
that
it's
a
fair
assumption
that
because
of
the
cloud
of
uncertainty
cast
over
this
portion
of
their
activities
by
the
board's
attempts
to
regulate
industrials
over
the
last
few
years,
that
there
are
many
industrials
who
are
waiting
to
see
what
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
is
on
this
issue.
the
american
financial
services
association
and
the
other
petitioners
that
i
represent
have
challenged
the
board's
efforts
to
bring
industrials
under
bank
holding
company
jurisdiction
not
only
because
of
their
conviction
that
industrials
were
never
intended
by
congress
to
be
covered
under
that
act
because
they
are
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
commercial
banks,
but
also
because
the
board's
new
treatment
of
industrials
confronts
corporate
owners
of
these
institutions
with
the
choice
of
either
radically
altering
their
own
activities
or
causing
the
institutions
to
curtail
their
services
to
their
customers
in
a
way
that
would
inevitably
make
them
less
useful
and
less
competitive.
i'd
like
to
dwell
just
a
bit
longer
on
the
board's
earlier
treatment
of
industrials,
because
i
think
the
defect
in
their
present
position
is
clearly
revealed
by
a
reference
to
the
history
of
the
board's
attempts
in
the
past
to
cover
industrials.
as
mr.
bradfield
said,
in
1956
the
sole
test
of
bankness
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
was
whether
an
institution
held
a
charter
as
a
national
bank
or
a
state
bank.
in
1963,
however,
the
fed
rule
that
a
state-chartered
industrial
loan
company
would
be
included
under
the
definition
of
bank
if
it,
and
now
i
quote,
"accepts
deposits
subject
to
check
or
otherwise
accepts
funds
from
the
public
that
are
in
actual
practice
repaid
on
demand,
as
are
demand
or
savings
deposits
held
by
commercial
banks.
"
the
actual
practice
language
was
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
savings
accounts,
both
in
industrials
and
in
commercial
banks,
have
historically
been
subject
to
a
reserved
right
in
the
institution
to
require
some
period
of
notice
before
withdrawal,
a
right
that
is
almost
never
exercised
even
though
its
reservation
is
uniformly
compelled
by
state
and
federal
law.
in
1965
the
board
reaffirmed
its
position,
holding
that
industrials
had
offered
investment
certificates
that
were
repaid
in
practice
on
demand
were
subject
to
the
bank
holding
company
act,
and
again
there
was
no
attempt
to
distinguish
industrials
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
offered
checking
accounts.
industrials
took
their
case
to
congress,
and
in
1966
congress
responded
by
repudiating
the
board's
attempt
to
extend
its
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
financial
institution.
congress
fully
recognized
the
difference
between
prior
notice
accounts
as
to
which
the
right
of
notice
was
required
but
almost
never
exercised
and
true
demand
deposits,
where
no
such
right
existed
at
all.
and
congress
amended
the
bank
holding
company
act
definition
to
include
as
banks
only
those
institutions
offering
deposits
that
were
withdrawable
on
demand
as
a
matter
of
legal
right.
the
board
argued
at
that
time
for
a
definition
that
used
the
terminology
demand
deposit,
but
congress
rejected
that
and
used
the,
the
very
technical,
rather
stilted
language
deposits
that
the
depositor
has
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand,
and
used
that
language
for
the
specific
purpose
of
assuring
that
deposits
that
were
withdrawable
as
a
matter
of
practice
on
demand
would
not
be
covered
under
the
act.
contrary
to
mr.
bradfield's
suggestion,
the
board's
definition
that
is
in
the
present
regulation
would
include
passbook
savings
accounts,
as
justice
o'connor
asked
if
it
would,
if
the
withdrawal
from
the
savings
account
was
made
by
check.
a
now
account
is
really
no
more
than
an
interest-bearing
savings
account
from
which
withdrawals
may
be
made
by
a
variety
of
methods,
either
by
presentation
of
a
passbook
or
a
withdrawal
slip
or
by
a
negotiable
instrument.
so,
a
now
account
is
nothing
but
an
interest-bearing
savings
account,
and
it's
distinguishable
from
a
true
demand
deposit
in
several
distinct
and
important
respects.
first
of
all,
and
foremost,
now
accounts
are
not
available
to
business
customers.
they're
only
available
to
individuals.
second,
now
accounts
may
bear
interest.
true
demand
deposits
may
not.
the
noninterest-bearing
account
that
is
available
to
businesses
that
is
the
classic
demand
deposit
account
is
what
congress
chose
as
the
hallmark
of
a
commercial
bank.
commercial
banks
still
issue
that
kind
of
account;
industrial
banks
do
not
and
cannot.
the
board
now
tries
to
reassert
its
jurisdiction
over
industrials
by
making
two
arguments.
first,
they
argue
that
depositors
do
in
fact
have
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand
until
the
institution
actually
exercises
its
right
to
acquire
prior
notice
of
withdrawal.
and
second,
they
argue
that
the
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand
language
really
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
but
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
checking
accounts.
i
don't
think
there's
any
merit
in
either
one
of
those
arguments.
the
first
argument
simply
amounts
to
playing
with
words
and
ignores
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
what
congress
clearly
meant
to
do
by
using
the
phraseology
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand
was
to
exclude
prior
notice
accounts,
fully
recognizing
that
the
prior
notice
is
almost
never
exercised.
the
board's
argument
flies
in
the
face
of
the
legislative
history,
and
it
would
make
nonsense
of
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
1966.
the
argument
also
flies
in
the
face
of
the
board's
own
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
distinction
between
demand
deposits
and
savings
deposits.
the
board
has
been
aware
for
decades
that
the
reserved
right
of
notice
is
almost
never
exercised
with
respect
to
interest-bearing
savings
accounts
that
are,
in
practice,
withdrawn
on
demand.
yet,
that
distinction,
as
slim
as
it
may
appear,
has
always
sufficed
in
board
regulations...
indeed,
it
suffices
today...
to
distinguish
such
accounts
from
demand
deposits
on
which
a
payment
of
interest
is
prohibited.
the
second
argument,
that
the
language
should
be
read
to
mean
checking
accounts
rather
than
what
it
says,
is
simply
wishful
thinking.
congress
did
not,
in
1966
or
at
any
time
thereafter,
define
banks
in
terms
of
the
means
by
which
deposits
could
be
withdrawn.
it
defined
them
in
terms
of
depositors'
legal
rights.
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
case
it
used
that
definition
to
distinguish
industrial
banks
from
commercial
banks.
congress...
if
congress
had
really
intended
the
method
of
withdrawal
to
distinguish
between
commercial
banks
and
industrial
banks,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
it
to
do
so
by
defining
that
leg
of
the
definition
of
bank
in
terms
of
checking
accounts
rather
than
accounts
that
the
depositor
had
a
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
more
important,
the
fed's
expansive
interpretation
of
1963
and
1965
that
led
congress
to
amend
the
act
to
insure
that
industrials
would
not
be
covered
were
not
keyed
simply
to
the
means
of
withdrawal.
they
were
based
on
the
fact
that
deposits
nominally
subject
to
a
right
of
notice
were
in
fast
paid
on
demand.
and
the
legislative
history
is
absolutely
clear
that
congress
did
not
consider
industrials
to
present
the
same
considerations
as
conventional
commercial
banks.
the
intention
of
congress
in
amending
the
definition
of
a
bank
was
to
exclude
industrial
banks
from
fed
jurisdiction,
not
to
describe
a
particular
means
of
withdrawal.
the
fact
was
then,
as
it
is
now,
that
industrials
do
not
and
cannot
issue
demand
deposit
accounts
from
which
a
depositor
has
an
unquenchable
legal
right
to
withdraw
on
demand.
unlike
commercial
banks,
they
can't
issue
checking
accounts
to
businesses
that
can
be
used
for
commercial
purposes.
their
accounts
are
limited
to
consumer
accounts.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
the
history
of
the
board's
effort
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
this
segment
of
the
financial
services
industry
makes
this
a
particular
compelling
case
to
leave
to
the
congress,
since
almost
20
years
ago,
congress
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
the
board
that
industrials
were
not
to
be
covered
under
the
bank
holding
company
act.
and
if
the
board
now
believes
that
industrials
have
so
changed
in
the
nature
of
the
services
that
they
offer,
a
proposition
that
we
vigorously
dispute,
it
should
be
required
to
make
that
case
to
congress
and
it
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
use
the
kind
of
jurisdictional
self-helps
that
it's
tried
to
use
here,
with
the
consequence
of
upsetting
years
of
settled
doctrine
and
creating,
unjustifiably,
turmoil
in
this
segment
of
the
financial
services
industry.
