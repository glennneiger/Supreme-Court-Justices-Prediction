mr.
graham,
can
i
ask
a
kind
of
preliminary
question?
as
i
understand
it,
this
was
a
proceeding
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
and
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
was
that
there
was...
an
unfair
method
of
competition
had
been
found.
there
wasn't
really
a
sherman
act
issue
on
its
own
terms
in
the
case,
was
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
notice
they
cited
some
section
1
cases,
but
the
section
of
the
legal
discussion
is
all
under
the
rubric
of
section
5.
do
you
think
that
makes
any
difference?
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
find
a
section
1
violation
in
order
for
there
to
have
been
a
section
5
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
is
a
necessary
element
of
their
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
price
case
would
it
be
necessary
to
show
that
there
was
an
impact
on
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
prove
an
agreement
to
fix
price,
do
you
have
to
prove
anything
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
part
of
your
submission
that
they
must
prove
an
impact
on
price
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
prove
an
impact
on
price
in
professional
engineers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
prove
an
impact
on
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
they
have
to
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
whatever
you
call
this
case,
do
you
think
it
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
commission's
case
that
they
prove
an
impact
on
price
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they
claim
they
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i
am
really
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
you
think
they
had
to
prove
an
impact
on
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
a
proper
diagnosis
for
prescribing
treatment,
isn't
it?
is
there
something
unethical
or
improper
about
an
insurance
company
writing
a
policy
saying
that
when
there
are
two
alternate
methods
of
treatment,
we
will
reserve
the
right
to
decide
which
one
we
will
pay
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
adequate
for
determining
what
they
will
pay
for.
don't
they
have
that
right?
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can't
they
say,
the
reason
we
won't
pay
for
a
gold
filling
is
because
we
think
a
plastic
filling
is
cheaper
and
that
that
is
adequate?
can't
they
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
should
determine...
do
you
think
they
must,
there
is
some
legal
rule
they
have
to
say
whatever
the
doctor...
for
whatever
the
dentist
thinks
is
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
thought
the
insurance
company
ought
to
send
a
dentist
out
and
review
the
files
on
every
patient,
and
the
insurance
company
said,
that
would
be
much
more
expensive,
and
will
run
up
the
cost
of
insurance.
isn't
that
what
it
is
all
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
is
a
more
expensive
way
and
the
cost
of
insurance
would
go
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
there
were
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
processing
method
of
going
to
the
office
by
individual
dentists
would
be
a
good
deal
more
expensive.
i
thought
that
was
in
the...
even
judge
coffey
acknowledge
that,
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
why
they
didn't
want
to
supply
the
ex-rays.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
again,
just
so
i
have
it,
why
did
the...
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
refusal
to
supply
ex-rays,
in
a
nutshell?
why
didn't
the
dentists
want
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
want
the
insurance
companies
to
engage
in
unethical
practice
of
dentistry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
basic
reason,
they
thought
it
was...
the
insurance
companies
would
be
unlawfully
engaged
in
the
practice
of
dentistry
if
they
cooperated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
follow
up
with
just
one
question
on
that,
mr.
graham?
mr.
graham,
it
is
your
position
if
they
supplied
the
ex-rays,
that
might
lead
to
the
unethical
practice
of
dentistry.
what
if
they
supplied
everything
but
the
ex-rays,
and
then
the
insurance
companies
did
the
best
they
could
without
the
ex-rays?
would
that
be
the
unethical
practice
of
dentistry
by
the
insurance
companies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
weren't
they
willing
to
do
that,
supply
everything
else
they
wanted
except
the
ex-rays?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
the
dentists
who
insisted
on
having
an
insurance
company
person
come
to
the
office?
weren't
they
willing
to
send
in
a
partial
file
just
excluding
the
ex-ray?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
didn't
that
raise
exactly
the
same
ethical
problem
as
sending
in
the
ex-rays
without
more
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
both
instances
the
insurance
company
was
trying
to
decide
whether
to
pay
the
claim,
wasn't
it,
whether
it
had
the
ex-ray
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
treatment
they
would
pay
for.
