we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
federal
trade
commission
against
indiana
federation
of
dentists.
ms.
tiffany,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
the
dentist
have
a
professional
interest
in
maintaining
the
ex-rays,
at
least
by
copy,
in
case
he
is
conceivably
sued
for
malpractice
later,
and
he
needs
the
ex-rays
to
defend
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
graham.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
tiffany?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
