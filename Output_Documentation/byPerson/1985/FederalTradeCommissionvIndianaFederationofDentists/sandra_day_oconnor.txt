the
commission
seems
to
have
conducted
a
sort
of
abbreviated
rule
of
reason
analysis
here,
not
really
doing
a
full-blown
inquiry
into
the
economic
effects
of
the
boycott,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
an
abbreviated
rule
of
reason
analysis
is
justified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
widespread
is
this
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
is
the
buyer
here?
is
it
the
ultimate
patient
who
wants
dental
services?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
product
here?
is
it
the
advice
necessary
in
order
to
monitor
dental
services?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
product?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
perhaps
the
product
was
the
advice
or
evaluation
services
that
insurers
provide
in
competition
with
dentists.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it
is
just
a
product
effect,
not
a
price
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
the
dentists
submit
a
narrative
explanation
of
what
work
they
were
proposing
would
be
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
available
to
the
insurance
company
to
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
they
aren't
relying
just
on
the
ex-ray
at
all.
they
have
the
benefit
of
the
narrative
explanation.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
from
what
you
have
said,
there
was
more
supplied
to
the
insurance
company
than
just
the
ex-ray.
there
was
the
proposed
work,
the
outline
of
the
work
to
be
done
and
the
narrative
description
and
the
opinion
of
the
examining
dentist,
so
the
insurance
company
has
all
that
available
plus
the
ex-ray
if
it
is
furnished.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
propose
that
the
insurance
company
has
to
physically
examine
the
patient,
surely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
sort
of
a
boycott
by
dentists
spread
to
other
states?
do
you
know?
