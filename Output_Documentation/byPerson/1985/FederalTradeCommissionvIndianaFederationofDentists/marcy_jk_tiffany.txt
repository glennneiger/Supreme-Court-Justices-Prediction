mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
a
conspiracy
by
indiana
dentists
to
refuse
ex-rays
requested
by
group
dental
health
care
insurers.
the
insurers
needed
the
ex-rays
to
detect
instances
of
fraudulent
claims
and
overtreatment
of
dental
patients.
their
goal
was
to
contain
the
cost
of
the
insurance
programs
they
were
administering,
a
goal
that
was
shared,
indeed,
insisted
upon
by
those
who
were
footing
the
bill
for
the
programs,
the
employers,
and
unions
who
had
negotiated
the
dental
benefits.
the
attitude
of
the
dentists
toward
this
cost
containment
effort
was
best
summed
up
in
the
words
of
dr.
david
mcclure,
one
of
the
chief
organizers
of
the
conspiracy
here.
dr.
mcclure
characterized
the
situation
as,
and
i
quote,
"economics
war
where
the
name
of
the
game
is
money.
"
and
like
all
wars,
this
one
had
its
victims.
here
they
were
the
patients,
the
consumers,
who
were
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
cost
containment
efforts
of
the
insurance
companies.
the
dentists'
response
to
the
insurance
companies'
cost
containment
efforts
should
not
be
surprising,
since
from
their
perspective
cost
containment
essentially
means
fewer
dollars
for
the
dentists.
to
again
quote
dr.
mcclure,
"management,
government,
labor,
and
the
insurance
industry
are
determined
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
dental
health
dollar
at
the
expense
of
the
dentist.
"
now,
a
third
party
payer
faces
a
difficult
problem
with
respect
to
cost
containment.
in
the
normal
purchase
transaction
the
individual
consumer
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
he
is
not
paying
for
more
than
he
needs.
however,
when
an
insurer
is
picking
up
the
tab,
consumer
self-interest
tends
to
coincide
with
that
of
the
seller,
which
is
to
say,
get
as
much
as
possible
cut
of
the
insurance
company.
thus,
the
responsibility
is
left
to
the
plan
administrator
for
finding
some
way
of
making
sure
that
it
is
paying
only
for
services
that
are
covered
under
the
contract.
in
this
case
the
dentists
were
well
aware
that
the
ex-rays
were
needed
for
this
purpose.
to
quote
dr.
mcclure
yet
again,
"the
fight
for
ex-rays
will
continue,
because
this
is
the
only
way
insurance
companies
can
control
their
costs.
"
the
fight
began
with
the
indiana
dental
association,
which
is
composed
of
85
percent
of
all
licensed
dentists
in
the
state
of
indiana.
this
group
organized
the
boycott,
and
did
so
very
effectively.
they
adopted
a
set
of
principles
of
acceptability
which
specified
that
insurance
plans
requiring
ex-rays
to
be
submitted
would
not
be
acceptable.
they
distributed
a
form
letter
to
their
members
to
give
to
the
patients
saying
that
they
would
not
provide
the
ex-rays.
they
also
initiated
a
pledge--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--that
was
the
extent
of
the
boycott.
they
refused
to
provide
the
ex-rays.
they
initiated
a
pledge
campaign
for
dentists
to
agree
in
writing
that
they
would
abide
by
the
ida's
principles
of
acceptability.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
no,
they
would
continue
to
serve
patients.
they
just
wouldn't
give
the
ex-rays
to
the
insurance
companies
so
they
could
determine
whether
the
claim
should
be
paid.
the
efforts
were
very
successful,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
eventually
most
indiana
dentists
were
refusing
to
provide
the
ex-rays
to
the
insurers.
now,
about
that
time
this
court
decided
the
goldfarb
case,
which
of
course
held
that
professions
do
not
enjoy
any
special
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
leaders
of
the
ida
boycott
were
understandably
nervous
about
their
possible
antitrust
liability.
the
response
was
to
form
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists
under
the
mistaken
belief
that
if
they
styled
themselves
as
a
union
they
would
be
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws.
to
once
more
quote
the
irrepressible
dr.
mcclure,
who
was
the
first
president
of
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists,
"they
would
no
longer
have
the
antitrust
albatross
around
their
necks.
"
the
mandate
of
ifd
was
clear,
to
continue
and
intensify
the
boycott
that
was
begun
by
ida.
equally
clear
was
the
economic
motivation
for
the
formation
of
ifd,
as
evidenced
by,
among
other
things,
the
constitution
and
bylaws.
they
explicitly
stated
that
ifd
was
organized
to
represent
the
socioeconomic
and
political
interests
of
the
dentists.
the
constitution
and
bylaws
authorized
strikes,
job
actions,
or
other
forms
of
economic
pressure,
and
they
provided
for
discipline
of
non-conforming
members.
based
on
a
record
developed
after
six
weeks
of
trial,
the
commission
concluded
that
this
conduct
reduced
or
eliminated
competition
among
dentists
as
to
their
policy
in
dealing
with
third
party
insurers.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
commission
declined
to
find
that
it
diminished
competition
among
insurers.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
that's
correct.
the
rule
of
reason
analysis
was
applied
here,
although
the
administrative
law
judge
had
found
that
a
per
se
analysis
would
have
been
appropriate
to
this
conduct.
the
line,
however,
between
per
se
and
rule
of
reason
is
not
always
a
clear
one,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
icaa
case,
and--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--i
don't
believe
we
would
refer
to
it
as
an
abbreviated
rule
of
reason.
the
analysis
was
conducted...
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
was
conducted,
and
it
was
extensive
enough,
given
the
facts
in
this
case,
to
reach
the
conclusions
that
the
commission
reached.
this
restraint
was
very
much
like
this
court
has
held...
restraints
this
court
has
held
to
be
illegal
without
an
elaborate
market
analysis.
paramont
famous
lasky
is
a
case
in
point.
that
case,
like
this
one,
involved
horizontal
competitors
who
were
refusing
to
deal
with
third
parties
except
on
terms
and
conditions
that
they
had
agreed
to,
that
they
had
specified
between
themselves.
it
is
also
very
much
like
the
professional
engineers
case.
here,
the
dentists
were
restricting
the
flow
of
price-related
information.
if
this
information
had
been
provided,
it
would
have
enabled
insurers
to
determine
whether
the
dentists
are
overtreating,
which
is
the
economic
functional
equivalent
of
overcharging.
this
in
turn
would
have
enabled
the
insurers
to
make
purchasing
determinations
that
would
have
lowered
their
costs.
thus,
as
was
the
case
in
professional
engineers,
while
this
is
not
a
naked
price
restraint,
it
is
a
restraint
that
directly
impacts
price.
without
this
type
of
restraint,
decisions
as
to
the
types
of
services
purchased
would
have
been
made
as
a
function
of
the
interplay
of
the
market
forces.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
did
reject
the
commission's
findings
on
an
evidentiary
basis,
finding
that
there
was
insubstantial
evidence
to
show
that
the
boycott
restrained
trade.
this
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
means
that
there
is
really
a
very
narrow
issue
facing
this
court,
and
that
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
the
standard
review
when
it
reversed
the
commission's
decision.
the
importance
of
this
case,
however,
goes
far
beyond
the
narrow
legal
issue
to
be
resolved
here.
the
problem
of
cost
containment
in
the
context
of
third
party
insurers
is
a
large
one.
it
has
dimensions
that
really
dwarf
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
as
amicus
briefs
point
out,
the
serious
problem
of
rapidly
rising
health
costs
is
one
that
is
here
to
stay.
indeed,
problems
similar
to
those
encountered
by
the
insurance
companies
in
indiana
are
being
faced
throughout
the
country.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
cost
containment--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--the
administrative
law
judge
made
a
finding
that
the
cost
containment
efforts
were
generally...
in
general
experience
were
effective
ones.
with
respect
to
indiana,
it
was
difficult--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--the
ex-rays
were
needed
to
do
the
cost
containment.
the
ex-rays
were
needed
to
do
the
alternate
benefit
determination,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
did
find
that
in
general
experience
alternate
benefit
determinations
have
been
effective
in
containing
costs.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
commission
basically
took
the
position
that
it
really
wasn't
necessary
to
establish
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
cost
containment
efforts
were
in
fact
effective
in
this
particular
case,
rather,
that
the
insurance
companies
were
entitled
to
give
an
innovative
cost
containment
effort
a
chance
to
operate,
which
they
did
not
have
here,
and
in
fact
that
was
one
of
the
difficulties
of
getting
evidence
in
indiana,
because
right
about
the
same
time
the
insurance
companies
started
the
alternate
benefit
programs,
the
boycott
began.
so
with
respect
to
indiana
itself
the
evidence
is
not
complete.
however,
there
certainly
was
evidence
of
similar
restraints
being
used
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
in
fact,
the
commission
had
entered
a
consent
agreement
in
texas
involving
dentists
who
had
been
involved
in
the
very
same
conduct.
in
fact,
there
was
some
evidence
that
the
indiana
dentists
were
attempting
to
export
their
boycott
to
other
states.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
you
mean
throughout
the
country
or
in
indiana?
the
references
to
the
concerns
throughout
the
country
are
fairly
oblique
in
the
record.
it
is
enough
to
give
the
indication
that
these
were
nationwide
insurance
programs,
and
that
they
faced
problems
in
other
states.
i
do
not
know
from
the
record
how
extensive
the
boycotts
are,
although
there
clearly
was
one
in
texas.
in
this
case,
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
send
a
clear
message
to
professionals
that
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
act
in
concert
to
obstruct
the
innovative
cost
containment
initiatives,
and
that
lower
courts
may
not
accept
unsubstantiated
assertions
of
professional
judgment
by
refusing
to
apply
appropriate
standards
of
review
to
the
determinations
of
government
agencies
regarding--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--yes.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
well,
there
were
several
effects
on
competition,
several
ways
that
competition
was
restrained.
first
of
all,
it
did
interfere
with...
the
boycott
interfered
with
the
ability
of
the
insurers
to
make
these
determinations
as
to
whether
they
were
being
overcharged.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
competition
among
the
dentists
was
certainly
both
for
dollars
and
for
patients.
patients
were
deprived
of
the
ability
to
pick
a
dentist
who
would
cooperate
with
their
insurance
company's
cost
containment
programs,
and
as
a
result
were
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
cost
containment
efforts
that
their
insurance
companies
were
attempting
to
undertake.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
when
the
cost
of
insurance--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--the
competition
was...
yes,
in
fact
i
believe
it
would
be
a
restraint
on
competition.
the
competition
was
with
respect
to
the
policy
of
dealing
with
third
party
payers.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
yes,
we
do
disagree
with
his
opinion,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
in
the
professional
engineers
case
there
was
a
restraint
that
dealt
with
bidding.
because
of
this
restraint,
the
purchasers
of
the
information...
of
the
services
were
not
able
to
get
information
that
would
allow
them
to
cost
compare.
here,
the
purchasers
have
to
be
understood
in
the
context
both
of
the
patients
who
are
purchasing
and
the
third
party
insurer
who
is
paying
for
it.
the
effect
is
essentially
to
have
a
bifurcated
purchaser.
you
have
one
person
who
is
going
in
and
getting
the
service
and
the
other
who
is
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
they
are
going
to
buy
that
service
and
pay
for
it.
insofar
as
this
restraint
made
it
impossible
for
the
insurance
companies
to
do
their
part,
to
be
able
to
make
the
determinations
that
they
were
willing
to
purchase
this
service,
yes,
it
affected
competition.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--that
really
would
be
a
very
secondary
finding.
just
as
in
the
professional
engineers
case,
i
mean,
arguably
the
people
who
were
purchasing
the
services
from
the
engineers
were
going
to
be
selling
their
buildings.
the
commission
by
parallel
didn't
find
that
it
would
interfere
in
their
ability
to
sell
buildings.
similarly
the
commission
didn't
find
that
it
would
interfere
in
the
insurance
company's
ability
to
sell
insurance
overall.
it
nevertheless
did
interfere
with
their
ability
to
buy
the
services.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
oh,
no,
justice
rehnquist.
what
the
commission
was
really
referring
to
there
was
the
fact
that
lower
prices
for
selling
the
insurance
would
make
insurers
more
competitive
between
each
other.
that
is
the
restraint
between
insurers
that
the
commission
was
referring
to.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
buyer
is
really
a
bifurcated
one.
it
is
the
patient
who
is
getting
the
services
and
it
is
the
insurer
who
is
paying
for
them.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
no.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
no,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the
product
is
dental
services.
and
a
decision
has
to
be
made
as
to
whether
those
dental
services
will
be
purchased.
that
decision
is
being
made
both
by
the
insurance
company
and
the
consumer.
the
patient
goes
in
and
has
a
problem.
they
want
to
purchase
the
service.
the
insurance
company
has
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
they
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
service,
whether
they
indeed
are
willing
to
purchase
the
service.
when
those
two
coincide,
there
is
a
transaction.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
there
certainly
is
an
element
of
the
insurer
providing
a
second
opinion,
if
you
will,
to
the
patient,
and
that
was
a
loss
to
the
patient,
not
having
the
benefit
of
this
second
opinion.
however,
that
was
only
one
of
the
many
effects,
and
certainly
the--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--i
think
that's
right.
the
price
effect
had
to
do
with
not
giving
the
insurers
the
information
they
needed
to
purchase
the
product.
the
commission
had
substantial
evidence
of
the
anti-competitive
effects
in
this
case
to
support
their
conclusions.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
the--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--yes,
the--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--that
is
correct,
justice
white,
and
they
had
substantial
evidence
to
reach
that
conclusion.
the
market
power
here
was
substantial
both
for
the
indiana
dental
association
and
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists.
with
respect
to
the
indiana
dental
association,
85
percent
of
all
dentists
in
indiana
belonged,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
teeter
found
that
virtually
all
of
them
participated
in
the
boycott.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
absolutely.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
absolutely,
justice
white,
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
there
was
evidence
of
patients
who,
for
example,
crossed
the
ohio
river
and
went
into
kentucky
to
find
a
dentist
who
would
cooperate.
the
unions,
who
were
very
interested
in
promoting
these
plans
and
making
these
plans
work--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--justice
white,
in
hindsight,
we
all
perhaps
could
be
more
clear,
and
so,
too,
the
ccmmission,
but
the
evidence
is
there,
and
it
is
there
in
the
record,
and
it
is
referenced
in
the
commission's
opinion.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
yes,
sir.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
that
is
correct.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
and
the
commission--
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
--the
commission
did
explain
what
it
did,
perhaps
not
as
crystal
clearly
as
it
could
have,
but
the
explanation
is
there,
and
moreover
the
evidence
is
there
to
support
the
conclusions
that
the
commission
reached.
let
me
address
for
a
moment
the
legal,
moral,
and
ethical
justifications
that
have
been
raised
in
this
case.
the
commission
gave
the
dentists
every
opportunity
to
come
forward
with
a
pro-competitive
quality
justification
for
their
no
ex-ray
policy.
the
commission
concluded,
however,
that
the
respondents
failed
to
present
any
evidence
of
such
quality
justifications.
indeed,
they
did
not
even
establish
a
logical
nexus
between
the
no
ex-ray
policy
and
any
possible
patient
quality
of
care
concerns
that
they
might
have.
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
dentists
were
being
asked
to
do
anything
improper
with
respect
to
the
patients.
the
ex-rays
they
were
being
asked
to
submit
had
already
been
taken
as
part
of
the
diagnostic
procedures.
with
respect
to
the
lay
examiners
who--

law

are

indiana
law
has
been
revised

are
now

only
one
that
was
constructed
by
the
indiana
dental
association
pursuant
to
this
boycott.
they
established
it
as
some
kind
of
ethical
rule.
but
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
indiana
law
that
would
have
prohibited
them
from
sending
the
ex-rays.

under

law
they
now
are
required
to
give
them
to

patients.
ms.

yes.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
i
think
at
that
time
the
law
did
not
address
it
one
way
or
the
other.
it
didn't

they
could
not.
ms.

that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
record
shows
that
the
insurance
companies
were
sensitive
to
that,
indeed,
in
some
instances,
in
trying
to
negotiate
a
plan
that
would
be
more
acceptable,
had
agreed
to
do
a
double
pack
ex-ray,
where
the
pack
would
take
two
ex-rays
at
the
same
time,
allowing
the
dentist
to
have
one
copy
and
sending
the
other
copy
in
to
the
insurer,
and
the
insurer
was
willing
to
pay
for
the
extra
cost
of
that
type
of
ex-ray
pack,
which
was
not
really
very
substantial
in
any
case.
as
to
the
lay
examiners
that
were
reviewing
these
claims,
much
has
been
made
of
lay
examiners
looking
at
ex-rays,
but
the
truth
of
the
fact
is
that
the
lay
examiners
could
only
approve
claims.
they
could
not
deny
claims.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
having
an
insurance
company
approve
the
claim
submitted
by
the
treating
dentist
could
in
any
way
cause
harm
to
a
patient.
as
to
the
dental
consultants
who
were
reviewing
the
more
questionable
ex-rays,
these
were
licensed
dentists.
contrary
to
respondent's
assertions
in
its
brief,
the
dentists
did
not
rely
on
the
ex-rays
alone
when
making
determinations
as
to
the
alternate
benefits.
rather,
they
could
and
did
consult
with
treating
dentists
before
determining
the
alternate
benefit
determinations,
and
moreover,
these
were
professionals.
they
used
their
own
professional
judgment
as
to
what
additional
information
they
needed,
and
in
fact
were
able
to
access
the
information.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
was
any
restraint
that
they
could
not
look
at
anything
but
ex-rays.
indeed,
there
was
no
evidence
here
of
any
alternate
benefit
determination
that
was
even
medically
erroneous.
moreover,
nothing
in
indiana
law
exists
to
justify
this
boycott.
there
is
no
express
prohibition
on
lay
persons
screening
the
ex-rays,
and
even
if
so,
there
was
nothing
in
indiana
law
that
would
authorize
this
kind
of
vigilante
group
boycott
to
enforce
the
law.
if
you
strip
away
this
legal,
moral,
and
ethical
veneer
that
the
seventh
circuit
applied
to
this
case,
you
really
are
left
very
much
with
a
case
like
professional
engineers,
where
the
professionals
were
saying,
we
are
the
professionals,
we
know
how
to
do
things
better
than
the
antitrust
laws
do,
better
than
the
competitive
market.
we
should
not
be
subject
to
those
constraints.
where
legitimate
pro-competitive
justifications
exist,
this
court
has
indicated
every
willingness
to
countenance
them.
but
professionals,
like
other
entrepreneurs,
have
a
direct
economic
incentive
to
keep
the
costs
of
their
services
high.
this
court
accordingly
must
demand
more
of
professionals
than
a
bare
assertion
that
they
know
what
is
best.
as
i
noted
at
the
outset,
this
is
a
war,
and
the
stakes
are
high.
the
cost
of
health
insurance
in
general
and
dental
health
insurance
in
particular
are
extremely
high
and
rising.
if
these
dentists
can
successful
engage
in
this
kind
of
obstructionist
conduct
in
the
face
of
the
abundant
record
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
conclusion
of
the
existence
of
an
antitrust
violation
here,
cost
containment
efforts
in
the
health
care
field
may
well
suffer
a
serious
setback.
accordingly,
the
commission
respectfully
requests
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
below
and
direct
that
court
to
affirm
and
enforce
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
ms.
marcy
j.k.
tiffany
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
bench,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
