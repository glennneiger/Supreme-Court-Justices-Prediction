justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
tiffany,
the
commission
refused
to
find
that
it
had
the
result
of
diminishing
competition
among
insurers,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
commission
uphold
that
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but--
--how
would
that
affect
the
competition
among
dentists?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
tiffany,
judge
fairchild's
concurring
opinion,
he
didn't
join
judge
coffey's
opinion,
he
says
pretty
clearly
that
no
evidence
was
developed
on
the
validity
of
an
assumption
that
a
dentist's
policy
of
refusal
of
cooperation
has
any
significance
in
competition
among
dentists,
and
the
ftc
decision
fails
to
analyze
the
proposition.
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
his
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two...
talks
about,
you
know,
this
is
the
battle
for
cost
containment
and
this
is
the
big
picture.
we
have
to
figure
out
what
evidence
was
developed
right
here
in
this
case,
and
not
go
to
generalizations.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
failure
of
the
ftc
to
make
a
finding
that
it
affected
competition
among
insurers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
just
trying
to
come
in
the
back
door
with
something
the
ftc
refused
to
let
in
the
front
door?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
the
ftc
declined
to
find
was
that
the
dentists'
concerted
action
reduced
competition
among
insurers.
now,
it
seems
to
me
when
you
say
that
the
insurer
is
really
another
buyer
and
he
was
competing
as
a
buyer,
you
are
insisting
there
was
a
finding
that
the
ftc
refused
to
make.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
an
insurance
company
at
least
have
a
backup
diagnosis
of
its
own
if
it
is
going
to
pay
the
bill?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
your
opposing
counsel
said
that
these
dentists
assisting
the
insurance
companies
didn't
use
just
the
ex-ray.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
an
insurance
company
say,
all
right,
we
don't
have
as
much
time
as
the
dentist
to
spend
on
these
individual
cases,
we
have
got
to
process
them,
we
are
going
to
make
our
backup
judgment
just
on
the
basis
of
ex-rays?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
say
that
is
not
cost
containment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
is
probably
not
going
to
opt
to
have
treatment
done
if
the
insurance
company
won't
pay
for
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
can
you
say
the
diagnosis
is
improper?
