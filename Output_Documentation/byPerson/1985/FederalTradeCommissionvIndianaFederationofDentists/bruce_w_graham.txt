mr.
bruce
w.
graham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
contrary
to
the
theme
of
the
commission,
this
case
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
crusade
to
lower
dental
costs.
the
commission
has
not
evidenced
that
these
cost
containment
provisions
did
contain
costs,
and
specifically
refused
to
do
so
at
the
administrative
hearing.
the
focus
of
this
case
should
be
the
proper
application
to
a
non-price
restraint
wherein
there
are
involved
valid
health
care
concerns
promulgated
here
by
a
small
group
of
indiana
dentists,
the
ifd,
and
particularly
the
review
that
an
appellate
court
should
apply
in
reviewing
the
application
of
a
rule
of
reason
under
these
circumstances.
now,
as
we
know,
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
decided
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
evidence
anticompetitive
effect
in
a
relevant
market.
thus,
absent
the
rare
instance
where
the
court
of
appeals
grossly
misapplied
the
substantial
evidence
standard,
the
commission
should
not
prevail
today,
and
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
should
stand.
i
think
it
is
important
to
kind
of
look
at
this
from
the
perspective
of
the
seventh
circuit
as
they
were
analyzing
this
case
initially.
they
saw
88
dentists
which
compromised
the
ifd
who
had
allegedly
engaged
in
a
restraint
of
trade.
these
88
dentists
were
scattered
around
three
parts
of
indiana,
and
specifically
in
fort
wayne
there
were
19
ifd
dentists
out
of
139
in
the
fort
wayne
area.
the
commission
in
their
opinion
stated
that
they
were
applying
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
the
seventh
circuit
expected
them
to
demonstrate
a
relevant
market
and
anticompetitive
effect
in
that
market.
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
that's
right,
they
spoke
briefly
to
market
power,
and
attributed
the
market
power
of
indiana
dental
association--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--well,
i
am
not
certain.
i
don't
think
they
ever
defined
exactly
what
the
product
market
was,
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
commission's
core
dispute
actually
at
this
point
in
time
is
that
the
seventh
circuit
required
a
full
competitive
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
that
in
that
analysis
they
considered
ifd's
quality
of
care
justifications.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
i
believe
the
commission
stated
that
they
were
applying
sherman
act
principles.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
no,
and
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
proceeded
under
the
same
theory
i
am,
that
the
commission
stated
they
were
employing
sherman
act
principles,
anticompetitive...
antitrust
principles,
and
that
is
how
the
case
was
analyzed
by
the
commission.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
yes,
i
do.
that
is
what
they
stated
they
were
doing,
so
that
is
what
i
expected
in
the
seventh
circuit
also.
definitely
in
this
particular
case
a
rule
of
reason
analysis,
a
full
competitive
rule
of
reason
analysis
was
really
required,
and
i
think
that
is
evidenced
by
a
number
of
things.
initially
we
find
in
the
initial
decision
by
the
commission
a
determination
that
ifd's
actions
were
per
se
restraint
of
trade.
although
the
initial
decision
tees
the
idea
that
a
rule
of
reason
might
be
applicable
in
this
case,
they
said
there
were
no
factors
to
outweigh
the
clearly
anticompetitive
effects
that
had
been
evidenced.
unfortunately,
the
initial
decision
never
indicated
what
those
were,
just
continually
referred
to
clearly
anticompetitive
effects.
the
final
order
of
the
commission
upon
the
urging
of
the
ifd
agreed
that
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
should
be
applied,
and
they
specifically
stated
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
is
so.
the
commission
stated
specifically
the
conduct
involved
in
by
ifd
was
not
aimed
primarily
at
excluding
competitors,
it
was
not
wholly
motivated
by
an
anticompetitive
purpose,
and
was
a
very
limited
refusal
with
regard
to
insurance
company
mandates.
only
the
ex-ray
was
withheld.
all
other
aspects
of
the
insurer-dentist
transaction
continued.
these
are
the
commission's
findings.
now,
as
to
why
they
applied
a
rule
of
reason
and
rejected
per
se
there
are
other
findings
in
the
commission's
decision
which
also
support
application
of
a
rule
of
reason.
they
found
that...
they
refused
to
make
a
finding
that
there
was
any
unfairness
to
consumers.
they
correctly
found
that
the
insurers
were
neither
a
customer
nor
a
competitor
of
the
dentist.
and
they
found
that
in
essence
there
was
no
impact
on
price,
and
the
commission
failed
to
evidence
any
impact
on
price
in
the
dental
industry.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
it
is
if
they
are
trying
to
analogize
this
to
a
price
case.
i
think
they
should
demonstrate--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--especially--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--if
you
demonstrate...
i
think
if
you
demonstrate
price-fixing,
you
are
at
least...
you
are
either
probably
in
a
per
se
rule
or,
if
it
exists,
some
kind
of
truncated
rule
of
reason
analysis,
which
apparently
they
are
touting
now.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
if
it
is
a
price
case,
or
as
if
they
are
saying
that
we
can
apply
somewhat
of
a
truncated
rule
of
reason
now.
you
know,
they
are
analogizing
this
case
to
professional
engineers,
is
what
they
are
doing.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
i
think
professional
engineers
was
an
absolute
ban
on
competitive
bidding.
i
think
it
was
facially,
for
all
intents
and
purposes--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--well,
i
don't
think
they
necessarily
had
to,
because--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--in
a
rule
of
reason
case
i
think
they--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--well,
or
other
anticompetitive
effects.
i
think
it
is
essential
they
prove
something
like
competitive
effects.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
i
know
they
claim
that.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
no,
i
don't
think
it
was...
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
because
this
case
is
not
a
price
case.
clearly
the
commission
rejected
per
se
analysis
and
stated,
we
are
applying
a
rule
of
reasons,
and
cited
to
chicago
board
of
trade,
which
basically
delineates
the
typical
considerations
to
be
analyzed
in
a
rule
of
reason
case.
unfortunately,
they
failed
to
carry
out
a
proper
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
this
out
to
them.
now,
only
after
the
seventh
circuit
vacated
the
opinion,
we
see
a
new
theory
evolving
on
appeal.
we
see
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
seventh
circuit
the
commission
now
stating
that
no
elaborate
analysis
was
necessary,
and
that
there
are
certain
types
of
anticompetitive
conduct
that
can
be
observed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye,
and
apparently
ever
now
in
their
reply
brief
apparently
the
commission
applied
some
kind
of
truncated,
slight
in
scale
rule
of
reason
analysis.
these
are
inventions
of
appellate
counsel,
because
they
are
not
in
the
commission's
final
order,
and
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
was
reviewing.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
a
complete
competitive
rule
of
reason
analysis
was
necessary
here,
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
commission
themselves
indicated...
this
is
a
novel
case.
the
relationships
in
this
case
are
not
traditional.
there
is
at
least
a
three-party
situation
involving
a
patient,
the
dentist,
the
insurer,
and
possibly
the
employer
of
the
patient
who
is
paying
for
the
dental
services.
aside
from
all
this,
ifd
presented
valid,
reasonably
objective
medical
concerns
about
the
practices
of
the
dental
insurers,
which
basically
were
that
insurance
companies
were
giving
another
opinion
as
to
the
necessity
and
adequacy
of
the
treatment
being
provided
by
the
dentist.
i
think
this
is
clear.
they
were
diagnosing.
i
think
the
initial
decision
admits
this.
the
initial
decision
further
indicates--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--well,
i
don't
think
that
our
clients
have
ever
had
any
problem
having
an
insurance
company
do
that,
if
they
do
it
properly.
the
problem
was,
the
insurance
companies
were
taking
a
single
diagnostic
aid,
the
ex-ray,
and
dentists
would
look
at
that
and
say,
well,
this
treatment
is
unnecessary.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
i
beg
to
differ.
i
will
point
to...
defer
to
the
initial
decision
finding
that...
on
page
241a
of
the
appendix
where
the
administrative
law
judge
admits
it
is
not
known
what
supplementation
for
diagnosis
is
being
made
by
the
insurance
companies
in
indiana,
and
not
only
is
he
admitting
that
they
are
diagnosing,
but
he
is
admitting,
i
don't
know
on
what
basis.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
because...
that
would
be
fine
if
they
were
just
trying
to
decide
what
their
limits
were
on
a
particular
case,
if
it
is
a
$50
case
or
a
$100
case.
what
they
were
doing
was
imposing
less
expensive
but
supposedly
adequate
treatment,
and
then
they
would
inform
the
patient,
we
are
only
going
to
pay
for
the
treatment
that
is
less
expensive
but
adequate
in
our
opinion.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
i
don't
think
it
contains
costs.
what
it
does
is
reduces
treatment,
because
a
patient
is
not
going
to
opt
to
have
treatment
done
when
somebody
else
has
told
him
that
it
is
not
necessary,
it
is
not
warranted.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
that
is
true.
that
is
also
true.
what
it
does
is,
it
works...
it
changes
the
originally
prescribed
treatment
plan
based
on
an
improper
diagnosis,
without
ever
looking
at
the
patient.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
because
the
work
rule,
the
evidence
at
trial
was
uncontradicted.
in
fact,
the
administrative
law
judge
made
a
finding
that
the
experts
which
we
presented
and
others
all
agreed
that
an
ex-ray
or
any
single
diagnostic
aid
is
not
enough
to
make
a
proper
diagnosis.
that
was
the
commission's
finding.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
no,
but
if
you
decided
that
there
is
a
treatment
that
is
adequate
based
on
a
very
poor
and
medically
unsound
basis--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--they
have
a
right
to
determine
what
they
are
going
to
pay
for,
but
they
don't
have
a
right
to
indicate
that
there
are
other
treatments.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
not
on
the
basis
of
an
ex-ray,
they
can't.
that
is
the
problem.
an
ex-ray
won't
reveal
what
type
of...
sort
of
material
necessarily
need
be
utilized
without--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--no.
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists
never
opposed
cost
containment
by
the
insurance
companies.
what
they
opposed
was
their
method
of
making
a--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--if
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
diagnose,
i
think
they
ought
to
do
it
properly.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
that
was
never
established.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
there
was
evidence
that
it
costs
$10
a
patient
to
do
that.
aetna
did
that
on
a
one-shot
basis.
there
was
also
evidence
that
the
cost
to
the
dentist
to
comply
with
the
insurance
company
forms
and...
costs
them
money,
too.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
they
supplied
everything
but
the
ex-rays.
they
supplied
claim
forms,
narratives.
they
would
speak
to
the
insurance
company
on
the
phone.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
because
the
insurance
companies
were
making
diagnoses.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
it
was
a
second
opinion
based
on
an
ex-ray.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
that's
right,
and
that
concern
is
evidenced
additionally
by
the
indiana
state
board
of
dental
examiners
since
at
least
1974--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--the
dentist
would--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--yes,
they
did
that
openly.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
yes,
but
the
narrative
is
not...
it
goes
much
farther
than
that
in
making
a
diagnosis,
and
i
believe
the
indiana
federation
of
dentists
work
rule
delineates
what
all
the
experts
indicated
was
true.
you
can't
just
look
at
a
single
diagnostic
aid
or
summary
in
a
claim
form
and
decide
that
this
treatment
is
not
necessary,
this
treatment
is
not
warranted,
as
the
commission
refers
to
it
themselves.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
and
the
evidence
was
that
that
was
not
sufficient
to
effect
another
diagnosis.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
there
is--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--well,
they
could
have
all
the
diagnostic
aids.
there
could
be
models,
impressions.
there
could
be
an
oral
exam,
which
aetna
conducted
for
some
while
on
4,700
patients,
i
believe.
you
can't...
you
are
unable
to
observe
the
health
conditions
of
the
patient
and
how
well
he
takes
care
of
his
teeth.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
going
into--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--no,
all
i
propose
is
that
they
not
diagnose
unless
they
know
what
they
are
doing,
and
that
is
what
the
federation
of
dentists
have
contended.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
well,
i
believe
so.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
in
the
office,
along
with
an
oral
examination.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
they
did
that,
yes.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
because
it
was
a
narrative
on
a
claim
form.
it
wasn't
a
diagnostic
aid
that
was
being
misused
by
the
dentist
at
the
insurance
company.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
no,
they
were
trying
to
decide
what
treatment
was--
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
--the
cheapest
treatment
that
they
decided
was
adequate,
is
what
they
were
doing.
in
any
event,
these...
there
were
at
least
valid
medical
concerns
here
by
ifd
that
should
have
been
looked
at
by
the
commission,
and
they
weren't.
the
entire
case
was
short-shifted.
it
was,
as
we
know
now,
a
truncated
rule
of
analysis.
mr.
bruce
w.
graham
there
was
similar
concerns
in
the
state
of
texas
and,
i
believe,
pennsylvania.
the
record
doesn't
really
reflect
this.
it
does
seem
evident
that
right
now
the
commission
is
now
asking
in
the
reply
brief
on
page
10
that
no
elaborate
industry
analysis
is
required
to
demonstrate
the
anticompetitive
effect
of
ifd's
actions,
citing
professional
engineers.
this
is
a
per
se
test
that
they
are
citing
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
their
evidentiary
requirements
and
prove
anticompetitive
effect,
they
are
now
saying,
well,
i
think
we
can
presume
anticompetitive
effect.
it
is
apparently
now
a
per
se
case
again,
because
they
are
citing
a
per
se
test.
i
think
it
is
pretty
evident
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case
was,
they
stated
they
were
going
to
apply
a
rule
of
reason,
but
they
presumptively
concluded
ifd
had
engaged
in
anticompetitive
conduct
and
then
looked
for
proof
of
procompetitive
effects.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
works,
especially
in
a
novel
case
involving
health
care
concerns.
the
rule
of
reason
requires
an
analysis
of
the
reasons
for
the
restraint,
the
history
of
it,
the
facts
peculiar
to
the
business.
that
was
not
engaged
in.
why
do
all
these
things
need
to
be
done?
to
determine
the
competitive
significance.
we
need
to
find
out
who
is
competing
with
who
on
what
basis,
in
what
market,
and
for
what
reasons.
why?
so
that
there
can
be
demonstration
of
anticompetitive
effect
in
a
relevant
market,
as
this
court,
i
believe,
has
recently
indicated
again
in
jefferson
parish.
these
are
the
same
concerns
the
seventh
circuit
had.
where
is
the
evidence
of
anticompetitive
effect?
what
is
the
market
that
was
affected?
well,
the
seventh
circuit
observed
that
the
commission
held
that
competition
was
lessened
amongst
dentists
in
their
policy
of
dealing
with
third
party
payer
insurers.
that
was
the
gist
of
their
holding.
the
seventh
circuit
delineated
a
series
of
factors
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
even
address
in
their
series
of
conclusory
assumptions
about
the
market
and
competition.
they
pointed
out
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
define
the
market
and
competitive
forces.
they
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
real
analysis
of
the
total
number
of
dental
patients
within
the
relevant
market,
or
the
percentage
of
those
covered
by
insurance
in
the
relevant
market,
the
availability
and
proximity
of
other
dentists,
the
fees
charged
insured
patients
as
opposed
to
uninsured
patients,
the
policy
of
non-fdi
member
dentists
in
dealing
with
insurers,
or
the
policy
of
insurers
in
evaluating
dental
treatment
plans.
there
was
no
analysis
of
the
additional
cost
to
dentists
to
process
claim
forms.
there
was
no
analysis
of
potential
disincentives
posed
to
dentists
for
submitting
diagnostic
aids
in
violation
of
fairly
well
delineated
state
policies
against
it
dating
back
to
1974.
no
evidence
of
price
alteration,
price
stabilization.
now,
in
short,
i
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
competitive...
competition
at
issue
was
not
defined.
they
didn't
know
who
competed
with
who
for
what,
for
what
reason.
very
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
patient
in
this
case,
which
is
actually
the
ultimate
consumer
of
dental
benefits.
they
didn't
demonstrate
an
effect
on
an
undefined
market.
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit...
the
commission
stated,
we
are
applying
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
under
the
circumstances,
it
needed
to
be
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
thus
they
had
a
burden
to
establish
anticompetitive
effect
in
the
relevant
market.
the
commission
is
stating
something
differently
now.
they
are
asking
for,
i
believe,
a
per
se
application,
or
at
least
some
kind
of
truncated
rule
of
reason
application.
well,
the
seventh
circuit
found
their
analysis
wholly
deficient.
they
said
rule
of
reason.
they
were
obligated
to
establish
the
effects.
and
there
simply
is
not
a
gross
misapplication
of
the
substantial
evidence
test
by
the
seventh
circuit.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
commission
should
not
prevail
on
their
petition.
thank
you.
