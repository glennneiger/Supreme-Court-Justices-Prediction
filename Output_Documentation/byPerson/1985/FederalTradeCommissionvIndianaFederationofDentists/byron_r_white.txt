that
was
the
extent
of
their
boycott,
wasn't
it,
just
not
providing
the
ex-rays?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
refuse
to
serve
patients
that
were
covered
by
these
health
plans?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
something
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
furnishing
these
ex-rays
would
be
a
step
to
contain
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
commission
make
any
findings
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
respect
to
the
ex-rays.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
a
desirable
goal
or
policy,
but
you
were
going
to
get
around
to
saying
how
that
restrains
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
how
their
conduct
restrains
competition,
even
if
it
maybe
isn't
in
the
public
interest
in
terms
of
cost
containment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
an
injury
to
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
patient
can't
find
a
dentist
who
will
send
his
ex-rays
in?
does
that
restrain
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
dentists?
competition
between
dentists,
among
dentists?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
they
really
find,
is,
it
resulted
in
reducing
or
eliminating
competition
among
dentists
as
to
their
policy
of
dealing
with
third
party
payers.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
they
really
focused
on,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
spell
that
out
a
little.
how
did
eliminating
competition
with
respect
to
their
policy
dealing
with
third
party
payers,
how
did
that
reduce
competition
among
dentists?
is
it
that
if
some
dentists
furnished
ex-rays
and
some
didn't,
the
ones
that
furnished
them
might
get
more
patients?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
word
would
get
around
that
here
these
hardnoses
won't
really
cooperate
with
my
insurance
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
could
have
said
a
little
more
than
it
did,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
rules
around
in
agencies,
and
i
take
it
the
ftc
is
an
agency--
justice
byron
r.
white
--one
of
the
administrative
rules
is
that
you
explain
what
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
adequately.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom
do
the
ex-rays
belong?
to
the
patient
or
the
dentist?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the...
would
the
dentist
have
broken
some
ethical
rule
if
the
patient
had
directed
him
to
send
the
ex-rays
to
the
insurer
and
he
had
refused?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
a
patient
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
the
ex-rays
you
took
of
me,
will
the
dentist
give
it
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
at
least
said
that
no
elaborate
analysis
was
necessary
to
define
the
market,
that
this
group
spanned
the
state,
and
it
was
the
state
that
was
the
relevant
market.
i
grant
you
it
was
in
a
footnote,
but
they
said
it
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
spoke
briefly
to
the
definition
of
the
market,
the
geographical
market,
anyway,
and
certainly
there
wasn't
much
question
about
what
the
product
market
was,
is
there?
