mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
kentucky
supreme
court
drew
an
artificial
distinction
between
evidence
between
confessions'
voluntariness
and
evidence
of
its
credibility.
that
distinction
is
premised
on
the
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
confessions'
constitutional
voluntariness
and
its
factual
reliability,
and
it
resulted
of
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
right
of
cross
examination
and
his
right
to
present
a
defense.
reduced
to
its
simplest
form,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
defendant
can
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
introducing
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
his
confession
was
obtained
for
the
purpose
of
showing
its
or
challenging
its
credibility
simply
because
the
trial
judge
has
determined
a
confession
to
be
voluntary
and
therefore
admissible.
at
the
onset,
defense
counsel
in
this
case
indicated
in
our
opening
statement
that
the
theory
of
defense
was
the
circumstances
under
which
this
confession
was
obtained
were
so...
demonstrated
the
confession's
lack
of
credibility,
and
that
that
lack
of
credibility
created
doubt
as
to
the
petitioner's
guilt.
the
prosecution
in
turn,
perceiving
defense
counsel's
challenge
as
an
attack
on
the
trial
court's
determination
of
the
confession's
constitutional
voluntariness,
moved
the
defense
be
procluded
or
prohibited
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained.
the
trial
judge
then
ruled
that
the
defense
could
show
evidence
about
factual
inaccuracies
in
the
statements
contained
within
the
body
of
the
confession,
but
would
be
precluded
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
the
circumstances
relating
to
the
confession's
voluntariness.
consequently,
the
defense
was
prohibited
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
the
size
of
the
interrogation
room,
the
number
of
police
officers
conducting
the
interrogation--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that
bears
on
the
credibility
of
the
confession,
the
length
of
the
interrogation
and
detention,
the
number
of
police
officers
present,
and
the
size
of
the
room.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
the
confession
also
lacks
credibility.
that
evidence
is--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
the
evidence
obviously
is
germane
to
voluntariness.
it
is
also
germane
to
credibility,
because
here
the
petitioner's
statement
of
confession
is
just
riddled
with
factual
mistakes
and
inaccuracies.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
and
indeed
defense
counsel
did
introduce
that
evidence.
we
introduced
evidence
about
the
misstatement
of
the
gun
and
the
fact
that
an
alarm...
the
petitioner
said
an
alarm
sounded,
and
there
was
no
alarm,
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
said
he
stole
money--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--but
there
is
a
reason
for
those
mistakes,
your
honor,
and
the
jury
was
precluded
from
hearing
any
evidence
as
to
why
the
petitioners
made
those
statements,
and
the
facts
surrounding
the
procurement
of
the
confession
are
germane
to
a
determination
of
why
the
petitioner
made
those
statements.
the
petitioner
here
was
interrogated
for
a
period
of
time,
approximately
an
hour
and
40
minutes,
and
indeed
the
jury
was
not
informed
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
questioned
and
talked
about
this
particular
liquor
store
robbery
for
some
nearly
45
minutes
before
he
gave
the
written
waiver
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
before
the
statement
was
actually
taped.
surely
those
circumstances
are
germane
to
the
issue
of
credibility
because
what
happened
in
that
interrogation
room
does
have
a
bearing
on
why
the
petitioner--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
true.
we
wanted
to
get
those
facts
in.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
when
the
confession
was--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
that...
and
the
length
of
time
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
ruling--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
feel
that
this
error
is
harmless.
we
believe
that
this
error
is
such
as
to
create
doubt
about
the
outcome
of
the
trial
and
to
raise
doubt
about
the
reliability
of
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
based
on
the
court's
most
recent
pronouncement
in
delaware
versus
van
arsdale,
the
fact
that
restriction
on
plaintiff's
right
of
cross
examination,
that
certainly
is
subject
to
the
harmless
error
analysis.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
determining...
in
ruling
on
this
issue
relied
on
this
court's
decisions
in
jackson
v.
denno
and
lego
v.
twomey,
concluded
that
the
petitioner
or
the
defense
could
introduce
evidence
about
the
credibility,
the
reliability,
and
the
weight
of
the
confession,
but
the
defense
was
precluded
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
based
on
an
artificial
distinction
that
the
courts
sought
to
draw
from
evidence
of
credibility
and
evidence
of
voluntariness.
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained
necessarily
overlaps
with
the
issue
of
voluntariness
and
the
issue
of
credibility.
moreover,
the
kentucky
court
ruled
that
the
trial
court's
findings
on
the
issue
of
the
constitutional
voluntariness
of
this
confession
were
preclusive,
and
the
preclusive
to
the
extent
of
preventing
the
defendant
from
introducing
any
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
given
simply
because
the
trial
judge
had
viewed
the
light
on
those
facts
in
determining
the
confession's
constitutional
voluntariness.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
decision
reflects
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
about
the
effect
of
the
trial
judge's
ruling
or
his
determination
that
the
confession
was
constitutionally
voluntary,
and
it
further
fails
to
recognize
the
very
different
purposes
served
by
suppression
hearings
and
a
trial.
in
a
suppression
hearing,
of
course,
the
judge's
function
is
to
determine
the
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
constitutionally
voluntary
based
on
prevailing
constitutional
standards.
the
trial
judge
doesn't
determine
the
confession's
truth,
its
falsity,
its
credibility,
or
its
reliability.
the
jury,
on
the
other
hand
is
charged
with...
during
the
course
of
the
trial
is
charged
with
precisely
that
responsbility.
it
has
to
determine
the
confession's
truth,
its
falsity,
its
credibility,
and
it
weight
in
order
to
make
its
ultimate
determination
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
jury
simply
cannot
fulfill
that
function
where,
as
here,
they
are
precluded
from
hearing
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained.
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
ruling
violates
the
petitioner's
right
to
present
a
defense
and
his
right
to
cross
examination
because
here
defense
counsel
is
prevented
from
introducing
evidence
that
supports
his
theory
of
the
defense
and
the
confession
is
so
lacking
in
credibility
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
believed
by
the
jury
and
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
give
it
any
weight.
i
think
it
is
probably
easy
to
summarize
this
by
saying
that
although
the
jury
could
hear
about
the
factual
inaccuracies
of
the
confession,
the
jury
simply
doesn't
understand
or
was
not
given
any
evidence
to
determine
why
the
petitioner
made
those
statements.
why
did
he
misstate
such
pertinent
facts
about
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
crime?
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
he
didn't
testify
at
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
this
is
not
a
fifth
amendment
situation,
your
honor.
it
is
the
right
to
cross
examination.
consequently,
we
would
submit
that
the
effect
of
the
kentucky
court's
ruling
is
to
deny
the
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
answer
and
defend
against
the
state's
charge.
the
petitioner
has
been
prevented
from
introducing
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
his
confession
was
obtained,
and
the
jury
cannot
therefore
make
a
reliable
assessment
of
the
confession's
credibility
and
its
weight,
because
the
jury
cannot
examine
the
effect
of
those
circumstances
under
which
his
confession
was
obtained
for
determining
its
credibility
and
its
weight.
ostensibly
the
state
interest
that
was
sought
to
be
protected
in
this
situation
was
to
prevent
new
litigation
of
the
issue
of
a
confession's
constitutional
voluntariness,
but
that
issue
simply
can't
be
advanced
or
protected
by
a
blanket
rule
that
prevents
the
defendant
from
introducing
circumstances
under
which
his
confession
is
given,
especially
where
the
rule,
as
here,
is
premised
on
some
artificial
distinction
between
a
confession's
voluntariness
and
evidence
of
its
credibility.
the
effect
of
such
rule
is
to
undermine
confidence
in
the
outcome,
and
it
substantially
diminishes
the
accuracy
of
the
truthfinding
process,
because
the
jury
never
hears
evidence
as
to
the
ultimate
question
of
why
the
confession
was
made
by
the
petitioner,
why
did
he
make
those
misstatements
of
fact,
why
are
those
inaccuracies
contained
within
the
substance
of
his
statement.
thus,
the
jury
is
unable
to
assess
the
effect
of
those
circumstances
on
the
confession's
credibility
or
its
weight,
and
surely
that
creates
doubt
and
uncertainty
as
to
the
reliability
and
the
accuracy
of
the
jury's
findings
on
this
issue.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
think
he
would
have
to
make
a
specific
objection
saying
that
the
size
of
the
room
relates
to
the
issue
of
the
confession's
credibility.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
this
room
here,
your
honor?
substantially
larger
than
the
interrogation
room
which--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
is
substantially
larger
than
the
interrogation
room--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
would
say...
well,
the
only
one
that
i
have
ever--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--the
only
ones
i
have
seen
are--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i
can't
give
you--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--because
the
size
of
this
room
is
small.
it
was
ten
by
ten
or
ten
by
twelve
at
best.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
is
a
factor
that
the
jury
can
use
to
determine
the
credibility.
when
the
circumstances
are
viewed,
the
petitioner
being
a
16-year-old
boy
operating
at
the
level
of
a
third
or
fourth
grade
child,
is
put
in
this
small
room
with
several
police
officers,
that
bears
on
the
reliability
of
what
the
defendant
or
petitioner
states
to
those
police
officers
in
the
course
of
that
interrogation.
and
that
why
the
room
is...
i
think
the
size
of
the
room
is
so
significant.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
based
its
decision
on
several
justifications,
one
of
which
included
perceived
difficulty
in
separating
evidence
of
the
confession's
voluntariness
and
evidence
of
its
credibility.
the
kentucky
court
reasoned
that
the
separation
function
is
better
vested
in
the
trial
judge
than
in
the
hands
of
the
jury.
that
conclusion,
however,
is
based
on
a
misperception
of
this
court's
ruling
in
both
jackson
and
lego.
this
court
acknowledged
in
those
cases
that
there
is
in
fact
difficulty
in
separating
evidence
of
a
confession's
voluntariness
from
evidence
of
its
credibility,
but
neither
case
expressed
any
doubt
that
the
jury
was
fully
capable
of
properly
using
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
determining
a
confession's
credibility
and
weight
simply
because
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
obtained
is
introduced.
neither
did
the
court
express
any
doubt
that
the
jury
could
not
properly
discharge
its
factfinding
function
merely
because
of
the
difficulty
in
separating
the
evidence
of
a
confession's
voluntariness
and
evidence
of
its
guilt.
indeed,
the
confidence
that
the
jury
can
properly
use
evidence
is,
i
think,
a
matter
of
common
experience,
and
it
is
perhaps
best
reflected
in
the
multiple
admissibility
rules,
which
when
applied
to
this
case
would
hold
that
evidence
of
a
confession's
credibility
is
not
inadmissible
simply
because
it
is
also
evidence
of
a
confession's
voluntariness.
as
we
indicated
in
the
appendices
to
our
brief,
every
jurisdiction
with
the
exception
of
kentucky
that
has
ruled
on
this
matter
allows
a
jury
to
determine
and
hear
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
is
obtained
for
the
purpose
of
determining
either
the
confession's
credibility,
its
voluntariness,
or
both.
the
second
justification
offered
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
for
its
rule
was
that
the
defendant
offers
very
selective
evidence
when
he
doesn't
testify
in
cases
in
which
his
confession
is
admitted
as
evidence
against
him.
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
jury
would
not
be
made
aware
of
the
defendant's
prior
experience
with
the
law,
his
familiarity
with
interrogating
procedures,
and
his
familiarity
with
his
miranda
rights.
consequently,
the
kentucky
court
reasoned
that
exclusion
of
such
evidence
would
allow
the
defense
to
paint
an
unfair
picture
for
the
jury.
that
perceived
danger,
however,
is
unlikely
to
exist
in
any
case
because
if
the
defendant
were
able
to
raise
improper
inferences
from
the
evidence
or
raise
or
submit
improper
evidence.
the
prosecution
surely
could
object
and
refute
that
evidence
by
making
specific
objections,
asking
for
admonitions,
or
even
introducing
rebuttal
evidence.
the
justifications
for
which
the
kentucky
supreme
court
based
its
ruling
herein
do
not
justify
the
abridgment
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
in
this
instance.
moreover,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
state
here
was
allowed
to
do
precisely
what
the
defendant
was
not
allowed
to
do,
and
that
is
to
introduce
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
procured.
the
state
introduced
evidence
that
on
two
occasions
prior
to
giving
a
statement
petitioner
was
fully
advised
of
his
miranda
rights.
he
was
explained
those
rights
in
detail
and
understood
those
rights.
moreover,
the
state
was
allowed
to
introduce
evidence
that
during
the
course
of
the
interrogation
procedure
the
petitioner
was
supplied
with
soft
drinks
and
refreshments
by
the
police
officers.
now,
obviously,
the
purpose
in
introducing
such
evidence
is
to
demonstrate
that
petitioner
was
well
treated
during
the
course
of
the
confession,
and
thus
the
confession
is
credible,
reliable,
and
trustworthy.
surely
if
the
prosecution
can
introduce
evidence
about
the
circumstances
under
which
a
confession
is
given
to
demonstrate
its
credibility,
the
same
opportunity
cannot
be
denied
the
defense
where,
as
here,
his
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
at
stake.
the
determination
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
its
ruling
here
undermines
the
historical
and
the
constitutional
role
of
the
jury
to
assess
and
determine
the
credibility
and
reliability
of
evidence
in
deciding
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
and
innocence.
the
findings
here
of
the
trial
judge
were
deemed
conclusive,
and
the
jury
could
not
consider
any
evidence
about
the
circumstances
surrounding
procurement
of
the
confession,
because
he
had
already
used
that
evidence
in
determining
the
confession's
constitutional
voluntariness.
it
is
important
here
to
realize
that
the
confession's
constitutional
voluntariness
is
made
without
regard
to
its
truth
or
its
falsity,
and
therefore
it
is
imperative
that
the
jury
be
advised
in
full
detail
about
all
the
evidence
under
which
the
circumstances
of
the
confession
were
procured
because
they
must...
the
judge
doesn't
decide
the
issue
of
credibility.
the
issue
must
therefore
be
decided
by
the
jury.
since
involuntary
confessions
can,
of
course,
be
untrue,
it
follows
that
as
part
of
the
right
to
present
a
defense,
defendant
must
be
able
to
fully
and
effectively
cross
examine
and
confront
the
police
officers
who
participated
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
in
order
that
the
jury
can
assess
the
effect
of
the
circumstances
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
we
would
submit
here
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
violated
the
petitioner's
right
to
present
a
defense
and
his
right
to
cross
examination,
and
that
the
rule
created
by
kentucky
is
not
only
an
artificial
distinction
it
sought
to
draw,
but
it
is
premised
on
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
effect
of
the
role
that
the
trial
judge
plays
in
the
suppression
hearing.
consequently,
the
rule
enacted
by
kentucky
results
in
an
impermissible
interference
in
the
petitioner's
right
to
present
a
defense,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
and
remand
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
just
got
a
couple
of
points
to
make
on
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
to
answer
just
a
couple
of
the
factual
questions
that
were
raised
during
questioning
by
the
court,
in
regard
to
justice
powell's
question
about
the
petitioner
being
able
to
call
his
parents,
he
did
state
at
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix
that
he
requested
to
call
his
parents
and
he
was
not
permitted
to
do
so
by
the
police.
of
course,
the
police
did
testify
in
the
suppression
hearing
that
they
made
efforts
to
contact
his
family.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
questions
relative
to
how
the
dissent
in
this
case
interpreted
the
majority's
view
of
the
rule
is
a
point
well
taken
because
here
on
page
29
of
the
respondent's
brief
the
respondent
argues
that
if
the
trial
court
rules
the
confession
voluntary
it
admits
into
evidence
none,
emphasis
by
the
respondent,
none
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
procurement
are
relevant
towards
credibility.
the
dissent
correctly
analyzed
the
kentucky
supreme
court
rule
here.
moreover,
if,
as
has
been
indicated
in
our
brief,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation,
i
believe,
in
which
the
court
can
approach
the
issue
or
resolve
the
issue
by
a
bright
line
approach,
because
evidence
of
credibility
necessarily
overlaps
with
evidence
of
voluntariness.
what
the
responding
is
arguing
is,
in
effect,
if
we
can
somehow...
is
that
the
trial...
first
of
all,
defense
counsel
is
going
to
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
determination
pretrial
what
is
evidence
of
voluntariness
and
what
is
evidence
of
credibility.
secondly,
the
trial
judge
is
going
to...
every
trial
judge
in
the
country
is
going
to
have
to
make
that
determination,
and
then
every
appellate
court
in
the
country
is
going
to
have
to
review
that
decision.
we
think
that
would
create
an
administrative
and
judicial
nightmare.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
this
is
harmless.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
i
believe
that
the
error
here
affected
the
outcome
and
raised
doubts
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
jury's
verdict.
here
the
evidence--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--primarily
because
the
confession
was
the
principal
piece
of
evidence
in
this
case.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
not
overwhelming,
because
there
was
no
physical
evidence
to
link
the
petitioner
to
the
crime.
the
statement
made
by...
the
inculpatory
statement
made
by
the
co-defendant,
we
pointed
out,
was
motivated
in
order
to
minimize
his
culpability
here.
the
statement
that
the
petitioner
was
alleged
to
have
made
to
his
mother
is
likewise
subject
to
scrutiny,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
demonstrate
a
lack
of
credibility,
because
here
we
have
a
young
man
who
has
demonstrated
a
propensity
to
confess
to
crimes
he
has
not
committed.
we
would
urge
for
those
reasons
that
this
ruling...
the
error
cannot
be
harmless.
thank
you.
