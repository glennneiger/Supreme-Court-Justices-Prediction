unknown
speaker
what
issue
would
that
have
borne
on,
mr.
heft?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
even
though
it
were
determined
that
the
confession
was
voluntarily
given,
those
factors
would
perhaps
induce
the
jury
to
believe
what?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
the
trial
court
say
you
could
produce
evidence
as
to
inaccuracies?
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
simply
mistakes
in
the
confession.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
only
two
facts
that
you
wanted
to
get
in
that
you
couldn't
get
in
was
the
size
of
the
room
and
the
number
of
officers
in
it.
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
only
two
facts
that
you
wanted
to
get
before
the
jury
that
you
didn't
get
before
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
but
you
say
even
if
those
are
the
only
facts,
they
were
still
very
relevant
to
reliability.
unknown
speaker
now,
mr
heft,
do
you
suppose
that
even
if
there
was
an
error
here,
that
it
could
be
harmless,
and
that
harmless
error
analysis
would
be
appropriate
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
it
is
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
insist
that
the
issue
of
constitutional
voluntariness
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
your
client
didn't
offer
to
testify.
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
his
having
been
prevented
from
testifying
about
something
that
he
wanted
to
testify
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
heft?
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
is
one
thing
happened,
that
you
asked
the
question,
what
size
was
the
room
that
my
client
was
questioned
in,
and
the
judge...
the
other
side
objects
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
immaterial,
and
the
judge
sustains
the
objection
without
more.
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
judge
says,
i
still
think
it
is
immaterial.
you
would
still
be
here?
unknown
speaker
is
this
room
any
larger
or
smaller
than
other
interrogation
rooms?
unknown
speaker
hm?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
courtroom?
is
that
what
you
are
talking
about?
no,
i
am
talking
about
where
he
was
interrogated.
unknown
speaker
how
large
is
the
usual
interrogation
room?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
object
to
the
size?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
insist
on
a
room
this
size,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
bear
on
these
curious,
almost
fantasy
responses?
unknown
speaker
hypothetically,
it
may
be
that
he
had
committed
so
many
of
these
offenses
that
he
got
them
confused
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
even
assuming
that
is
true,
why
aren't
the
circumstances
admissible
evidence
under
the
lego
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
your
submission
that
any
evidence
that
went
into
the
voluntariness
finding
by
the
judge
should...
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
reliability
of
the
confession?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
this
case
just
boils
down
to
you
would
think
there
would
be
some
evidence
that
if
the
trial
judge
excluded,
it
would
be
error.
some
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
the
voluntariness
hearing
you
would
think
should
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
can
you
think
of
any
evidence
that
should
be
admissible
with
respect
to
reliability
that
was
used
at
the
voluntariness
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can't
even
imagine
any?
unknown
speaker
so
really
the
supreme
court's
reservation
really
doesn't
mean
very
much.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
they
said
that,
but
you
can't
imagine
any
evidence
that
the
constitution
would
require
be
admitted.
unknown
speaker
it
is
settled.
it
is
held
to
be
voluntary.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
the
evidence
as
to
the
size
of
the
room
here
which
the
defendant
wanted
to
get
at
by
cross
examination,
why
doesn't
that
bear
on
reliability
in
the
sense
used
by
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
the
fellow
was
in
a
fairly
small
room,
you
know,
a
hot...
you
know,
let's
assume
a
hot
sweatbox,
four
or
five
officers
there.
you
know,
maybe
he
wasn't
thinking
too
clearly.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
often
defendants
under
interrogation
felt
a
compulsion
to
say
something,
tell
something
to
satisfy
the
police
and
get
them
off
his
back.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gillig,
may
i
interrupt?
i
think
one
can
read...
the
kentucky
supreme
court
opinion
is
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
i
have
to
agree,
but
having
read
the
dissent,
and
the
dissent
seems
to
have
read
the
majority
as
saying
that
voluntariness
and
credibility
are
sort
of
mutually
exclusive
categories,
and
that
if
it
relates
to
voluntariness,
then
it
is
almost
presumptively
not
relevant
on
credibility,
it
seems
to
me
one
can
read
the
kentucky
supreme
court
opinion
that
way,
as
saying
they
are
two
quite
separate
issues,
and
you
are
not
defending
that
interpretation
of
the
opinion,
if
i
understand
you.
you
are
saying
we
should
read
the
opinion
differently.
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
go
ahead.
if
we
thought
the
dissent,
however,
was
correct
in
interpreting
the
majority
opinion
below,
i
take
it
that
you
would
agree
we
should
reverse?
unknown
speaker
if
we
read
the
majority
opinion
like
the
dissent
did,
do
you
agree
we
should
reverse?
unknown
speaker
yes.
is
that
what
the
dissent
thought
the
majority
said?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
agree
that
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
opinion,
too.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
right.
join
the
crowd.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
yes,
but
you
say
that
we
affirm
this
on
the
basis
of
what
a
dissenting
opinion
said
it
means.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is...
maybe
i
am
ignorant,
but
what
is
avowal
testimony?
unknown
speaker
how
does
avowal
testimony
differ
from
other
testimony?
unknown
speaker
and
their
testimony
was
outside
of
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
was
this
16-year-old
given
any
opportunity
to
call
his
parents?
unknown
speaker
was
he
specifically
given
the
opportunity
to
call
his
parents?
unknown
speaker
was
that
before
or
after
the
interrogation?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
iq
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
testimony,
i
think,
to
the
effect
that
he
was
in
the
fourth
grade
or
had
ability
at
that
level.
unknown
speaker
do
high
schools
in
kentucky
graduate
people
who
are
third
and
fourth
grade?
unknown
speaker
that
is
per
se.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
in
the
credibility,
it
is
out
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
have
listened
to
that,
but
i
can't
find
it
in
the
opinion
any
place.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
that
is
before
us
is
just
the
opposite
to
what
you
say.
it
said
if
it
is
in
the
credibility,
then
it
is
out.
unknown
speaker
take
an
old
case
from
mississippi
where
they
took
hank
ellington
and
put
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
pulled
him
over
a
rafter
and
said
they
would
let
him
down
as
soon
as
he
confessed,
and
assume
that
was
brought
out
in
the
admissibility
hearing,
and
it
was
held
to
be
admissible.
would
you
be
prevented
from
bringing
that
out?
would
that
be
immaterial?
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
dispute
on
my
mississippi
facts.
unknown
speaker
they
bragged
about
it.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
had
been
admitted
as
voluntary.
and
the
defense
counsel
sought
to
bring
out
that
the
man
was
hung.
would
you
think
that
was
immaterial?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
supreme
court
said
it
would
be
immaterial
because
it
was
in
the
suppression
hearing.
unknown
speaker
okay,
it
doesn't
apply
to
hanging.
unknown
speaker
you
have
used
the
word,
in
fact,
we
all
use
the
word
voluntariness.
do
you
think
voluntariness
is
kind
of
an
either/or
proposition,
or
do
you
think
there
are
possibly
degrees
of
voluntariness,
and
some
confessions
are
a
good
deal
more
volunteer
than
others?
unknown
speaker
and
here
the
finding
in
the
suppression
hearing
is
that
it
crosses
at
least
a
minimum
threshold
sufficient
to
make
it
admissible,
but
could
it
not
be
possible
that
it
would
still
be
relevant...
the
whole
area
of
how
voluntary
it
was
would
nevertheless
be
relevant
on
the
question
of
credibility
in
almost
every
case?
unknown
speaker
he
walks
in
himself
without
any
pre-warning
and
says,
i
want
to
confess
to
a
crime
i
committed
last
thursday
at
8:00
o'clock.
you
get
one
picture
there
of
somebody
who
sits
in
a
small
room
with
four
police
officers
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
ends
up
by
confession.
maybe
that
is
not
quite
as
voluntary
as
the
first
example--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
it
would
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
wrong
with
a
rule
that
said
this
opens
the
gates
and
let
everything
in
to
tell
the
full
story
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
confession
and
the
extent
to
which
it
was
voluntary,
how
tired
he
was
and
all
that?
what
would
be
wrong
with
a
rule
that
said
all
of
that
evidence
would
just
come
in,
and
not
worry
about
whether
you
call
it
voluntary
or
credibility?
what
would
be
wrong
with
such
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
only
final
to
the
extent
that
it
governs
admissibility
before
the
jury.
it
is
not
final
in
any
other
sense.
unknown
speaker
you
are
really
arguing
that
the
rule
that
you
favor
is
better
for
the
defendant.
that
is
what
you
are
really
arguing.
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
this
is,
assuming
error,
that
it
is
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
it
raised
doubts
about
the
reliability
of
his
confession?
