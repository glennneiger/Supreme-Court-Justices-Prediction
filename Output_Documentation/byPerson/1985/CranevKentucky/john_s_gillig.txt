mr.
john
s.
gillig
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
proceeding
with
our
analysis
of
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
would
like
to
correct,
first
of
all,
what
is
perhaps
a
mistake
or
a
different
emphasis
in
the
facts,
and
that
is
that
major
crane
was
operating
at
a
somehow
diminished
level
or
diminished
capacity.
it
was
true,
and
it
was
stated
that
he
was
operating
at
a
low
academic
level
in
the
third
or
fourth
grade,
but
he
was
evaluated
as
a
sophisticated
delinquent,
and
in
its
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
the
trial
court
stated
that
he
had
had
numerous
experiences
with
the
law,
and
was
street
wise,
and
knew
very
well
what
he
was
doing,
and
so
we
simply
want
to
point
that
out
to
the
court.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
i
think
it
bears
on
that
simply
because
it
is
not
the
basis
for
these
responses.
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
speculate
why
he
said
exactly
what
he
said.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
our
contention
is
that
the
rule
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
crane
is
unexceptional
in
that
it
merely
states
that
evidence
to
be
admissible
must
be
relevant,
and
the
kentucky
supreme
court
said
that
in
this
case
this
evidence
was
simply
irrelevant.
now,
lego
said
that
the
states
have
been
as
free
since
jackson
v.
denno
as
they
were
before
to
formulate
their
own
rules
of
procedure
so
long
as
adequate
safeguards
are
provided,
and
we
believe
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
done
just
that.
it
is
not
anything
unusual
or
exceptional
to
say
that
evidence
should
be
relevant,
and
the
trial
court
merely
made
a
ruling
that
the
evidence
was
relevant,
and
that
was
upheld
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
so,
we
don't
believe
that
lego
approves
the
procedure
which
was
used
by
kentucky
in
this
case,
but
it
doesn't
really
address
the
issue
that
is
presented
here,
if
indeed
there
is
an
issue
presented.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
in
fact,
if
i
could
read
just
briefly
from
the
holding
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
it
said
once
a
hearing
has
been
conducted
pursuant
to
the
rule,
and
the
trial
court
has
made
its
ruling,
then
that
ruling
or
finding
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
is
conclusive,
as
this
court
permitted
in
jackson
versus
denno.
the
trial
court
may
exclude
evidence
relating
to
voluntariness
from
consideration
by
the
jury
when
that
evidence
has
little
or
no
relationship
to
any
other
issue.
this
shall
not
preclude
the
defendant
from
introduction
of
any
competent
evidence
relating
to
authenticity,
reliability,
or
credibility.
so
we
are
simply
saying
that
all
this
rule
does
is
say,
or
reaffirm,
really,
the
basic--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--i
would
say
it
could
be
argued
that
if
that
evidence
had
been
used
in
the
voluntariness
hearing,
then
you
could
present
the
argument
to
the
trial
court
that
that
issue
had
already
been
taken
care
of.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
i
think
that
would
depend
quite
a
bit
on
the
case.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
no,
sir.
i
would
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
could
say
that
assuming
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
if
he
were
claustrophobic,
perhaps,
then
you
could
lay
a
foundation
that
that
might
be
relevant--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--well,
if
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
a
settled
issue--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--yes,
sir.
and
then
in
that
case
there
may
be
other
cases
in
which
the
evidence
which
is
presented
at
the
suppression
hearing
is
relevant
to
credibility,
or
there
may
not.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
i
believe
that...
well,
of
course--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--well,
of
course,
that
brings
up
another
point.
his
contention
was
that
he
made
up
a
story
to
please
the
police,
so
i
don't
think
if
he
were
in
a
sweatbox
type
situation
that
that
would
necessarily
relate
to
his
propensity
to
make
up
a
story
to
please
the
police,
just
as
i
might,
say,
make
up
a
story
to
please
a
teacher,
or
some
other
authority.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
if
that
is
the
basis
for
him
saying
that,
then
we
would
argue
that
it
would
be
a
case
of
coercion,
and
then
the
confession
would
be
involuntary
in
any
event,
but
we
are
not
saying
that
it
is
impossible
for
another
court
to
disagree
with
the
findings
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
that
this
evidence
in
fact
was
not
relevant
to
this
case.
another
court
may
so
find,
but
that
still
doesn't
go
back
to
the
basic
premise
presented
by
the
case,
which
is
simply,
once
the
voluntariness
issue
was
decided,
that
some
evidence
which
is
presented
in
the
voluntariness
hearing
may
then
be
properly
excluded
by
the
trial
court
at
the
regular
trial.
if
we
could
point
out,
in
the
petitioner's
petition
for
cert
to
this
court,
in
some
language
that
was
dropped
in
a
later
brief,
he
said
that
in
this
case
the
fact
that
a
petitioner
was
given
his
miranda
warnings
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
this
case.
the
miranda
warnings,
the
fact
that
he
was
given
his
miranda
warnings
might
well
and
would
indeed
bear
on
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession,
but
it
really
isn't
relevant,
as
petitioner
has
stated
before,
to
determining
whether
or
not
he
made
up
a
story
to
please
the
police.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
finding
of
relevance,
then
that
would
be
another
factor
to
this
case,
but
it
doesn't
go
back
to
the
basic
premise
that
evidence,
to
be
admissible,
must
be
relevant,
and
that
is
all
this
opinion
says
from
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
yes,
i
would...
i
am
not
defending
the
sense
interpretation
of
this
opinion.
in
the
opinion
it
says
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
related
solely
to
voluntariness,
but
it
also
said,
having
little
or
no
relationship
to
any
other
issue,
and
if
evidence
has
little
relationship
to
any
other
issue,
it
may
have
some
relationship,
so
i
think
there
is
a
bit
of
ambiguity
there
that
would
enable
a
finder
of
fact
or
a
trial
court
to
conclude
that,
yes,
there
can
be
some,
there
can
be
evidence
which
is
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
that
is
not
relevant
to
credibility.
of
course,
it
works
the
opposite
way
as
well.
the
trial
court
in
making
that
determination
in
the
suppression
hearing
is
not
permitted
to
examine
the
reliability
of
the
confession
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
confession
is
voluntary.
so,
to
that
extent,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indeed,
i
think,
recognized
a
distinction.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
you
are
saying
if
we
read--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--you
are
saying
if
you
would
read
the
opinion
to
say
that
all
circumstances
relating
to
voluntariness
are
automatically
excluded
from
the--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--apparently...
i
believe
so,
but
i--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--well,
i
wouldn't
believe
that
that
would
be
proper,
but
if
it
is,
if
you
do
read
it
that
way,
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
be
reversible
error,
because
i
believe
that
you
could
go
ahead
and...
if
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made,
then
it
may
be
the
important
factors
which
are
to
be
weighed
might
justify
making
that
distinction
in
all
cases
and
saying,
well,
if
it
is
raised
in
the
voluntariness
hearing,
and
if
it
relates
solely
to
voluntariness,
then
it
can't
be...
i
am
getting
very
confused.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
the
purpose
of
the
suppression
hearing
is
to
determine
the
voluntariness,
and
credibility
is
excluded.
when
you
determine
credibility,
we
would
argue
simply
that
the
court's
opinion
says
some
evidence
may
be
excluded--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--and
some
may
not.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
i
think
we
should
affirm...
i
think
this
case...
it
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
majority
said,
not
on
the
basis
of
what
the
dissent
said.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
in
that
case,
what
they
simply
did
was,
they
took
the
police
officers
aside.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
they
testified
without
the
presence
of
the
jury,
so
that
we
would
have
a
record
of
what
they
would
have
said
if
they
had
been
allowed
to
testify
as
they
wished.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
yes,
your
honor.
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers,
he
was
able
to
do
practically
anything
he
wanted
to.
if
he
had
requested
a
call,
they
certainly
would
have
done
that.
he
requested
several
things,
to
go
to
the
restroom,
and
he
requested
a
coke,
and
a
bag
of
chips,
and
that
kind
of--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--i
don't
know
if
they
specifically
said,
you
may
call
your
parents
if
you
want.
they
made
numerous
efforts
to
contact
his
mother
and
his
grandmother,
and
i
believe
the
record
reflects
ten
attempts
in
a
period
of
about
two
hours.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
i
believe
this
was
beginning
before
and
continuing
all
the
way
through.
he
was
only
actually
interrogated
for
about
45
minutes,
as
we
document
in
our
brief.
he
was,
of
course,
in
custody
for
a
longer
period
of
time,
but
the
actual
interrogation
was
very
short.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
i
don't
believe
that
is
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
yes,
your
honor.
he
had
been
evaluated
six
months
prior
to
this
by
a
social
worker.
he
was
in
a
program
for
juvenile
delinquents
essentially
on
another
crime,
and
had
been
evaluated
as
operating
at
an
academic
third
or
fourth
grade
level.
the
trial
court
heard
major
crane
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
time
the
trial
court
simply
said
that
this
court
recognizes
that
there
are
many
people
who
have
graduated
from
high
school
every
day
which
are
operating
at
the
third
or
fourth
grade
level.
the
trial
court...
and
the
social
worker
had
evaluated
him
as
a
sophisticated
delinquent
who
knew
how
to
manipulate
people
to
get
what
he
wanted,
and
the
trial
court
again
found
him
to
be
street
wise.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
i
think
that
happens
in
kentucky.
i
think
it
happens
everywhere.
the
fact
that
one
has
a
high
school
diploma
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
one
can
read,
unfortunately,
but
he
certainly
didn't
have
a
high
school
diploma
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
that
is
in
evidence.
but
we
do
believe
that
his
prior
experiences
with
the
law
are
the
kinds
of
factors
which
are
relevant
to
a
suppression
hearing
and
which
are
brought
out
fully
before
the
trier
of
fact
but
which
never...
would
never
make
it
to
the
jury,
if
that
is...
if
the
issue
of
voluntariness
is
then
presented
to
the
jury.
so,
we
think
that
that
is
an
important
factor.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
decision
they
never
attempted
to
define
voluntariness
and
credibility.
perhaps
some
of
the
issues
that
the
court
seems
to
be
concerned
about
are
really
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
next
case
when
a
confession
comes
down
regarding
another
factor,
whether
the
kentucky
supreme
court
would
find
that
relevant
or
irrelevant,
but
the
holding
in
this
case,
we
believe,
is
very
limited.
it
simply
says
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
relevant,
and
it
says
because
the
voluntariness
hearing
has
been
conclusively
decided,
that
forecloses
some
items
of
evidence,
and
then
it
lists
two
of
those
items.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that
that--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
trial
court
in
each
case
at
the
conclusion
of
a
suppression
hearing,
assuming
the
situation
would
reoccur,
would
then
evaluate
what
the
defendant
was
seeking
to
present.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
enough
for
a
defendant
to
stand
up
and
say,
okay,
we
argued
voluntariness,
we
argued
that
we
were
held
in
a
small,
windowless
room,
and
that
was
voluntariness.
now
it
is
the
trial,
and
we
don't
want
to
argue
voluntariness
any
more,
we
want
to
argue
credibility.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
whether
that--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--no,
sir,
i
believe
it
says
that...
in
this
case
what
it
said
was
that
because
these
issues
had
been
presented
to
a
voluntariness
hearing...
it
is
not
really
because
it
is
presented
to
the
voluntariness
hearing.
it
is
whether
it
relates
to
voluntariness.
these
issues
might
never
have
been
even
raised
in
the
voluntariness
hearing,
but
when
the
petitioner
comes
back
and
says,
what
we
want
to
do
is
show
that
i
was
held
in
a
small,
windowless
room,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
that
issue
was
faced
in
the
suppression
hearing.
the
trial
court
can
say,
but
that
is
a
voluntariness
issue.
you
are
arguing
voluntariness,
and
that
has
already
been
decided,
and
so
that
evidence
is
simply
irrelevant.
we
don't
need
to
present
it
to
the
jury,
and
there
are
going
to
be
significant
disadvantages
to
the
state
if
we
do
present
it.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
i
believe
that
the
situation
there
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
because
that
is--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--that
is
a
fact.
it
is
a
disputed
fact,
in
other
words,
whereas
the
facts
which
were
sought
to
be
admitted
here
were
facts
about
which
there
was
really
no
dispute.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
oh,
i
see.
you
are
saying
that
the
police
officers
didn't
say
that
that
didn't
happen.
they
accepted,
they
said,
yes--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--well,
in
that
case,
then
of
course
the
confession
would
be
involuntary,
and
it
would
never
be
admitted.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
your
honor,
i
believe
that...
i
believe
that
it
probably
would
be
immaterial.
that
is
not
what
the
supreme
court
has
said,
so
i
can't
really
say
what
the
kentucky
supreme
court
would
do.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the
supreme
court
has
made
the
ruling
that
strict.
i
don't
believe
they
said
simply--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--but
i
believe,
on
the
other
hand,
that
you
would
be
talking
about
the
necessity,
perhaps,
for
having
a
second
layer
of
defense,
and
that
has
not
been
constitutionally
required
by
this
court.
we
would
have
to
rest,
i
believe,
on
this
case
on
the
fact
that
the
suppression
hearing
is
there
to
make
an
initial
determination
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
certainly
there
are
degrees
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
well,
i
believe--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
and
so
i
think
that
in
each
individual
case
then
it
would
depend
on
what
the
defendant
was
arguing
when
he
got
to
trial
and
said
i
want
to
argue
credibility
now,
so
that
you
wouldn't
just
say
just
because
the
defendant
lost
the
voluntariness
hearing,
therefore
all
circumstances
of
the
confession
are
always
admissible,
which
is
exactly
what
petitioner
wants.
petitioner
wants
that
to
say
there
is
no
distinction,
therefore
all
the
facts
are
admissible,
and
so
we
would
disagree
with
that.
it
would
be
an
evaluative
thing
by
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--well,
of
course,
that
is
essentially
the
massachusetts
rule.
what
we
argue
is
wrong
with
the
massachusetts
rule,
two
things.
first
of
all,
the
trial
judge
who
is
making
the
initial
voluntariness
determination,
if
he
knows
that
all
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
presented
to
the
jury
again,
then
he
has
a
reason
to
just
sort
of
take
a
brief
look
at
that
confession
and
maybe
not
give
the
voluntariness
hearing,
the
initial
suppression
hearing
the
emphasis
that
it
deserves
as
a
binding,
as
a
final,
as
a
determination
of
that
defendant's
rights,
whether
they
have
been
violated--
mr.
john
s.
gillig
--yes,
under
the
massachusetts
rule,
but
he
may
tend
to
just
pass
that
along
pro
forma,
and
then
you
go
back
to
what
the
result
this
court
disapproved
of
in
stein
versus
new
york,
which
was
also
a
case
where
the
trial
court
would
simply
look
at
the
confession,
see
if
there
was
a
reasonable
issue,
and
then
send
it
to
the
jury,
and
the
problem
this
court
found
with
that,
and
the
problem
that
is
still,
we
believe,
in
the
massachusetts
rule
is
that
once
the
jury
gets
the
confession,
makes
the
decision,
there
is
no
real
way
to
say,
well,
did
they
rely
on
the
confession
and
convict
because
of
the
confession,
or
did
they
not
rely
on
the
confession
and
convict
him
anyway,
and
that
can
cause
problems
later
on
for
appellate
review.
mr.
john
s.
gillig
yes,
sir,
we
believe
so.
we
would
simply
say
again
that
there
are
some
sound
policy
reasons
for
this
rule
that
have
been
enumerated
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
pointed
out
first
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
separating
the
factors
relating
to
voluntariness
and
credibility,
and
felt
that
this
determination,
because
there
is
some
difficulty,
is
best
left
to
the
trial
judge,
not
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
voluntariness
is
a
settled
issue,
so
that
to
the
extent
that
evidence
would
relate
to
voluntariness,
then
it
is
not
really
necessary
to
retry
that
issue,
and
finally,
if
the
evidence
of
voluntariness
is
retried
to
the
jury,
then
there
is
the
possibility
of
confusing
the
jury,
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
defendant's
previous
experiences
with
the
law
would
not
get
in,
there
is
the
possibility
that
his
familiarity
with
miranda
rights
and
other
things
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
hearing
simply
wouldn't
be
introduced,
and
the
petitioner
here
has
made
the
argument
that
if
the
prosecution
could
rebut,
if
the
defendant
got
up
and
because
he
didn't
take
the
stand
created
the
impression
that
he
was
somehow
misled
by
the
police
or
coerced
by
the
police
essentially
and
arguing
the
voluntariness
all
over
again.
the
problem
is
that
under
kentucky
he
would
not
be
able
to
rebut,
even
if
the
petitioner
takes
the
stand
under
kentucky
law
the
most
you
can
do
is
ask
if
he
has
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
then
when
he
says,
yes,
i
have,
then
that
is
the
end
of
it.
you
can't
say,
well,
how
many
times
have
you
been
arrested,
how
many
times
have
you
been
interrogated.
a
defendant
can't
say,
well,
i
have
been
interrogated
ten
or
twenty
times
just
this
year.
it
is
simply
not
possible
to
effectively
rebut
a
presumption,
assuming
such
a
presumption
would
be
created.
one
final
point
that
the
petitioner
brought
out.
he
says
that
kentucky
stands
alone
on
this
issue.
i
don't
believe
if
the
court
examines
the
cases
which
are
presented
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief
that
you
will
find
that
kentucky
does
stand
alone.
we
are
not
saying
that
other
states
stand
with
us.
we
are
not
saying
that
we
stand
alone.
the
problem
is,
it
is
very
difficult
to
sort
out
exactly
where
the
states
would
come
down
on
this
issue,
because
it
has
not
really
been
presented.
in
many
of
the
citations
in
his
brief,
for
example,
citations
to
rules,
state
rules
of
evidence,
number
104,
those
are
all
patterned
on
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
104,
and
all
that
says
is
that
no
evidence
relating
to
the
weight
or
credibility
of
the
confession
shall
be
excluded,
and
that
is
exactly
what
crane
versus
commonwealth
says.
so,
simply
because
a
state
court
cites
to
their
own
rule
of
evidence
which
is
patterned
on
federal
rule
of
evidence
104,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
looked
at
this
issue
or
they
have
decided
this
issue.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
believe
that
the
impetus
for
the
kentucky
court's
ruling
or
the
kentucky
court's
holding
in
crane
is
simply
that
it
is
recognized
the
degree
to
which
this
court
has
adjusted
what
may
come
into
a
voluntariness
confession
and
simply
recognizes
that
they
don't
need
to
retry
that
issue
before
the
jury.
and
so
for
these
reasons
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
crane
is
a
valid
rule.
it
doesn't
break
any
new
ground,
really,
and
for
that
reason
it
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
