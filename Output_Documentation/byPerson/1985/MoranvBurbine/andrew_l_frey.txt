mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wasn't
planning
to
address
the
sixth
amendment
issue,
but
in
response
to
your
question
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
that
what
triggers
the
sixth
amendment
is
the
existence
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
not
the
existence
of
an
attorney-client
relationship.
the
sixth
amendment
i
believe
simply--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
and
none
of
those
things
are
enough
to
trigger
the
sixth
amendment.
it
no
more
addresses
that
issue
than
the
seventh
amendment
does.
it
simply...
and
i
believe
that
the
way
couveja
dealt
with
escobedo
would
establish
that.
in
escobedo
there
was
i
think
an
existing
attorney-client
relationship,
but
my
recollection
is
that
gouveia
said
that
the
criminal
prosecution
hadn't
begun
for
the
sixth
amendment.
that
was
a
false
start.
let
me
say
that
when
the
relevant
and
well-established
constitutional
principles
and
policies
are
considered,
the
conclusion
that
the
first
circuit
erred
in
this
case
is
logically
inescapable.
first
of
all,
the
court
has
said
too
many
times
to
leave
the
issue
in
any
doubt
that
there's
no
constitutional
policy
against
obtaining
and
using
voluntary
confessions.
similarly,
it
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
purpose
of
miranda
is
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination;
that
the
requirement
of
warnings
and
waivers
represents
a
means
of
ensuring
that
the
elements
of
compulsion
in
the
stationhouse
interrogation
have
been
satisfactorily
counteracted.
thirdly,
the
court
has
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
you
do
not
need
a
lawyer
to
waive
your
rights
to
a
lawyer
or
to
waive
your
other
miranda
rights.
in
fact,
the
notion
that
miranda
creates
a
right
to
counsel
is
i
think
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
parties
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
there
is
no
direct
constitutionally
created
right
of
an
arrested
suspect
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
rather,
the
miranda
warnings
tell
him
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
because
it
is
believed
important
that
he
understand
that
he
can
have
that
kind
of
help
so
that
we
can
have
assurance
that
when
he
chooses
to
speak--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
ensure
the
voluntariness
of
his
statement.
the
purpose
is
to
dispel
what
was
found
to
be
inherent
coerciveness
of
custodial
interrogation,
and
in
that
case
it
is
a
sort
of
white
lie
that
seems
to
me
quite
harmless
and
in
fact
useful,
considering
the
purposed
of
miranda.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
police
do
not
have
to
provide
a
lawyer
if
he
asks
for
a
lawyer.
they
need
simply
terminate
the
interrogation.
they
only
need
to
provide
a
lawyer
if
they
want
to
continue
the
interrogation.
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
when
they
arraign
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
that's
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
would
not
have
had
to
provide
him
a
lawyer
at
the
lineup
in
this
case
under
kirby
against
illinois.
it
was
rhode
island
policy
to
do
so.
now,
the
central
constitutional--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
it
would
matter
for
your
purposes.
the
central
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
therefore,
has
to
be,
in
light
of
the
settled
principles
that
i've
alluded
to,
whether
respondent's
decision
to
speak
was
coerced.
now
it's
logically
impossible,
i
think,
that
the
failure
to
tell
him
about
attorney
munson's
phone
call
could
bear
on
that
inquiry.
everybody
agrees
that
he
was
given
the
warnings
correctly
and
that
he
made
what
in
all
other
respects
is
a
voluntary
waiver,
knowing
his
rights.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that's
true,
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
deception
point.
but
i
want
to
make
this
point
because
it
seems
to
me
a
point
of
logic.
you
just
would
have
to
say
white
is
black
to
get
around
it,
it
seems
to
me.
if
this
was
a
perfectly
good...
if
his
state
of
mind
was
adequate
to
make
a
voluntary
waiver
of
his
rights,
then
some
fact
that
occurred
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about
couldn't
have
affected
his
state
of
mind.
therefore,
in
terms
of
the
voluntariness
or
the
degree
to
which
he
may
have
been
coerced,
there
simply
is
no
possible
effect
of
the
failure
to
tell
him.
now,
all
of
this
seems
so
obvious
that
it
is
puzzling
how
the
first
circuit
and
so
many
state
courts
could
possibly
have
reached
a
contrary
conclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
that
that
would
be,
i
believe,
within
their
eights
to
say
that
to
the
attorney;
and
i
think
the
issue
of
misleading
a
lawyer
is
a
total
red
herring
in
this
case,
because
there
is
not...
as
long
as
they
have
a
right
to
say
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--as
long
as
they
have
the
right
to
say
that,
there
is
no
casual
connection
between
any
deception.
this
is
not
a
case
about
lawyer's
rights;
this
is
a
case
about
the
rights
of
mr.
burbine.
this
is
not
a
case
about
etiquette.
we
may
condemn
their
deception,
if
indeed
there
was
deception
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
absolutely,
absolutely
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
what
is
not
a
red
herring
or
what
is
more
to
the
point
in
this
case...
and
it's
a
problem
that
has
been
discussed
by
this
court
before...
is
whether
knowing
that
a
lawyer
had
called
would
affect
his
decision
whether
or
not
to
invoke
his
rights.
i
think
that
is
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
this,
that
he
would
be
better
informed
and
make
a
better
advised
decision
if
he
knew
that
a
lawyer
had
called.
now,
that
is
what
i
think
explains
the
decisions
and
i
think
that
is
based
on
fallacy,
and
it's
precisely
the
issue
that
was
the
point
of
disagreement
in
united
states
against
washington
in
this
court.
what
he
needs
to
know
in
order
to
make
a
satisfactory
waiver
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
is
his
rights.
he
does
not
need
to
know
the
facts
that
bear
on
a
wise
excercise
of
his
rights.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
escobedo
was
a
dead
end
and
i
think
the
court
has
since
made
clear
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
escobedo
wanted
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
as
well.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
nobody
is
questioning
that
if
the
respondent
in
this
case
wanted
a
lawyer
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
continue
interrogating
him
without
giving
him
a
lawyer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did
not
say
he
wanted
one.
he
said
he
did
not
want
one.
the
argument
is
that
if
he
had
only
known,
if
he
had
only
known
that
this
lawyer
who
he
had
never
heard
of
has
called,
that
might
have
affected
his
decision.
this
is
precisely
the
point
that
justice
brennan
made
in
his
dissent
in
united
states
against
washington.
if
he
had
known
he
was
a
target,
he
might
have
been
better
able
to
decide
whether
to
speak
or
not
to
speak.
my
point
is
simply
that
the
constitution
doesn't
call
for
him
making
a
wise
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
the
better
advice
would
probably
cause
most
suspects
whose
causes
reach
the
appellate
courts
not
to
have
spoken.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
and
precisely
why
society
wants
to
establish
a
set
of
rules
that
do
not
needlessly
discourage
them
from
talking.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
i
think
that
clearly
comes
from
this
court's
cases.
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
very
much
room--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
of
course
one
of
the
points
that
seems
quite
clear.
you
could
have
a
different
rule
if
the
focus
were
on
knowing,
and
this
gives
rise
to
all
kinds
of
problems,
because
there
are
lots
of
things
other
than
whether
a
lawyer
has
called
that
would
be
quite
relevant
to
an
intelligent
decision
of
whether
to
speak
to
the
police
about
the
matter
or
not.
you
might
want
to
know
what
the
punishment
is
for
the
offense.
you
might
want
to
know
whether
the
victim
has
died
or
not.
you
might
want
to
know
what
the
sentencing
practices
of
the
judges
are.
you
might
want
to
know
what
kind
of
deal
prosecutors
are
likely
to
make
to
people
who
confess.
there's
an
endless
list
of
things
that
may
indeed
have
a
bearing
on
making
an
intelligent
decision
whether
or
not
to
speak.
the
focus
of
the
fifth
amendment
voluntariness
or
coercion
inquiry
is
precisely
on
knowing
your
rights.
if
you
know
your
rights,
you
choose
not
to
exercise
them,
then
you
may
be
a
fool,
and
i
think
in
a
case
like
this,
where
we
have
been
able
to
convict
somebody
who
has
committed
quite
a
serious
crime,
i
think
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
outcome.
and
of
course,
this
court
is
not
the
cranston,
rhode
island,
police
department,
it's
not
the
rhode
island
legislature,
and
it's
not
the
united
states
congress.
now,
any
of
them
may
elect
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
adopt
a
rule
that
a
call
from
a
lawyer
should
be
relayed
in
to
the
client.
i
don't
think
would
be
good
policy--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
the
focus
is
on
deception
of
the
party
before
the
court.
if
there
had
been
deception
of
mr.
burbine...
and
i'd
like
to
say,
because
in
miller
against
fenton,
the
new
jersey
confession
case,
you
asked
a
question
about
whether
deception
would
be
condoned
there,
and
i
think
my
answer
would
have
been
a
little
different
from
the
answer
of
counsel.
i
don't
think
deception
is
condoned
in
procuring
a
waiver,
deception
of
the
suspect.
deception
of
the
lawyer--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
the
whole
thing
is
not
a
charade.
the
whole
thing
is
something
that
the
court
has
designed
for
a
particular
purpose
and
that
the
court
has
concluded
and
i
assume
experience
has
shown,
since
the
court
has
adhered
to
it,
is
effective
for
accomplishing
that
purpose.
it's
not
a
charade.
just
because
you
tell
him
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
come
up,
because
once
he's
given
the
lawyer,
which
i
assume
he
may
often
be
given,
or
he
may
not...
once
he's
given
the
lawyer,
there's
no
confession.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
