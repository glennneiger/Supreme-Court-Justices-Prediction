why
would
one
condemn
deception
in
reviewing
a
state
proceeding
unless
there
was
something
in
the
constitution
that
prohibited
it?
justice
william

rehnquist
supposing
an
attorney
comes
into
state
court
and
sues
a
client
that
he's
represented
in
a
criminal
case
in
federal
court,
saying
you
promised
me
10,000
lucks
for
defending
you,
you've
never
paid
it.
is
the
relationship
governed
by
federal
law,
whether...
the
nature
of
an
attorney
relationship,
just
because
the
suit
took
place
in
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
any
different
than
saying
it's
a
federal
question
whether
or
not
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship
created?
