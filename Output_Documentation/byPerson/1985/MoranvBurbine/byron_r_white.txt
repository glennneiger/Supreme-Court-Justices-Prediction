justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
prisoner
didn't
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
know
he
was
available
for
this
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
even
know
he
was
available
for
this
action.
he
didn't
know
whether
the
attorney
would
represent
him
for
this
purpose
also,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
his
family
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
when
they
arraign
him,
or
when
the
criminal
prosecution
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
really
started
when
they
start
the
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
seem
to
follow
from
the
fact
that
you
don't
need
a
lawyer
to
waive
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
think
also
that
the
remedy
for
this
breach
of
right
is
to
hold
that
his
confession
is
involuntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
usually
the
test:
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
is
it
voluntary?
and
you
say
that's
a
determinative
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
a
finding
of
fact,
why
isn't
the
state
court's
finding
of
fact...
why
isn't
it
a
finding
of
fact
that
there
wasn't
an
attorney-client
relationship
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
a
historical
fact
or
is
that
a
judgment
about
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
if
this
were
really
the
case
there
would
be
some
voluntariness
cases
before
miranda,
and
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
them
about
lawyers,
weren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
got
any
case
from
that
era
that
supports
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
mr.
mann,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
burbine
was
put
under
intensive
pressure
by
the
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
assertion
was
that
it
wouldn't
violate
either
the
fifth
or
the
sixth
amendments,
what
they
did.
they
didn't
say
that
it
was
proper
conduct,
didn't
say
that
people
who
did
that
wouldn't
be
subject
to
discipline.
