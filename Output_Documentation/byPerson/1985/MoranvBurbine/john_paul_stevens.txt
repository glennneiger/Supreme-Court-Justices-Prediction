justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
question
on
that
point.
the
first
circuit
opinion
cites
several
different
state
court
opinions
that
generally
take
the
same
position.
there
are
differences
in
the
facts
of
the
cases.
are
there
any
states
other
than
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
that
have
taken
the
position
that
you
advocate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
important
he
understand
he
has
a
right
even
if
he
doesn't
have
a
right;
that's
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
you
take
the
argument
to
it
logically
conclusion,
as
your
associate
does
also,
i
take
it,
that
this
is
true
no
matter
how
serious
the
deception
by
the
police
to
the
lawyer
might
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
is
that
even
though
that
may
be
empirically
true,
it
still
doesn't
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
a
matter
of
law,
even
if
better
advice
might
have
caused
him
to
make
a
different
decision
or
better
information?
that's
still
too
bad,
because
he
had
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
precisely
why
the
police
don't
want
them
to
talk
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
society
establishes
a
rule
that
if
voluntarily,
even
if
we
know
perfectly
well
he
would
have
made
a
different
decision
if
he'd
been
fully
advised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say
the
miranda
warning
itself
is
a
lie.
he
tells
him
he's
got
a
right
he
doesn't
have.
the
whole
thing
is
a
charade.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
cases
have
we
seen
in
which,
after
saying
you
can
have
a
lawyer
right
away
and
he
says
i'd
like
a
lawyer,
how
often
does
he
get
the
lawyer
right
away?
they
just
don't
question
him.
they
never
provide
him
a
lawyer.
