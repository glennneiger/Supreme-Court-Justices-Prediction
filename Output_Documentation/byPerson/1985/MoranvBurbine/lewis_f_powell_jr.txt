powell,

mr.
mann,
may
i
put
a
hypothetical,
lets
assume
that
a
public
defender
office
had
enough
lawyers
so
that
it
was
able
to
call
the
police
department
in
a
city
of
modest
size
and
say:
we
have
enough
lawyers
to
provide
counsel
in
every
felony
case,
and
we
put
you
on
notice
now
that
we
want
to
be
advised
whenever
you
arrest
a
person
charged
with
a
felony,
and
we
will
send
a
lawyer
promptly
to
represent
him.
would
that
be
different
from
your
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
what
respect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
had
it
begun
in
this
case?
it
was
about
to
begin,
but
it
hadn't
begun.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
my
case
the
only
difference
is,
instead
of
a
sister
saying
that
she
had
engaged
a
particular
lawyer
who
wanted
to
be
present
for
the
interrogation,
the
public
defender'
soft
ice
said,
we'll
provide
a
competent
lawyer
to
represent
every
felon
and
we
put
you
on
notice
we
want
our
lawyer
to
be
present
before
any
interrogation
begins.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
a
friend
had
called
instead
of
a
sister.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
am
i
reading
the
right
place?
i
think
it's
the
district
court
opinion
that
says
that:
"there
is
no
suggestion
here
of
political...
of
police
brutality
or
of
coercion,
psychological
duress,
illicit
inducement,
intimidation,
or
the
like.
"
"burbine
was
not
grilled
for
long
stretches
of
time,
nor
in
an
unusually
oppressive
circumstance.
"
it's
