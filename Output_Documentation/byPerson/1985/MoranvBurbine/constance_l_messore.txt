ms.
constance
l.
messore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
petitioner's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
the
first
circuit
erred
when
it
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
federal
district
court
and
issued
the
respondent's
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
in
doing
so,
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
respondent's
three
written
waivers
of
his
miranda
rights
and
his
three
signed
confessions
should
be
suppressed
because,
although,
he
had
beer
given
the
complete
miranda
warnings
prior
to
each
confession
and
he
had
agreed
to
waive
his
rights,
his
waivers
were
not
knowingly
made
whom
he
had
not
requested,
had
because
an
attorney,
called
the
police
station
where
he
happened
to
be
in
custody,
had
been
given
misleading
information
by
whomever
answered
the
telephone
and
was
told
that
there
would
be
no
further
interrogation
of
the
respondent
that
night,
and
the
respondent
was
not
informed
of
this
telephone
call.
i
feel
in
this
particular
case
that
it's
important
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts,
and
then
i
would
like
to
explain
why
the
first
circuit
has
misconceived
the
role
of
the
attorney
under
the
miranda
case
in
our
opinion.
the
respondent,
brian
burbine,
was
arrested
with
two
other
men
on
a
breaking
and
entering
charge
by
the
cranston
police.
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
he
was...
the
other
two
men
were
interrogated
by
the
cranston
police.
as
a
result
of
this
interrogation,
there
was
suspect
cast
on
brian
burbine
that
he
might
be
a
suspect
in
a
murder
that
had
taken
place
in
a
neighboring
town...
city
of
providence
three
months
prior
to
his
present
arrest.
at
this
time
the
cranston
police
called
the
providence
police,
who
came
to
the
cranston
police
station.
they
gave
burbine
his
miranda
rights,
and
first
he
said
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
mary
jo's
murder.
and
so
they
put
him
back
into
the
smaller
room
where
he
had
been
kept.
but
about
ten
minutes
later,
they
heard
a
banging
and
a
kicking
on
his
door,
and
he
was
brought
out
into
the
main
room
and
he
told
them
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he'd
done,
he
was
disgusted,
and
that
he
wanted
to
confess.
at
this
time
the
providence
police
again
gave
him
his
miranda
warnings
orally,
he
read
them,
he
signed
a
waiver,
and
then
eventually
signed
a
written
confession
implicating
him
in
the
murder
of
mary
jo
hickey.
he
was
placed
back
in
the
room
and
shortly
thereafter
he
stain
initiated
a
conversation
with
the
police,
saying
that
he
had
left
something
out,
there
was
more
that
he
wished
to
say.
he
was
brought
out,
again
given
his
miranda
rights
orally,
signed
a
written
waiver,
and
gave
an
additional
confession.
it
just
so
happened
that
this
same
evening
somehow
his
sister
had
discovered
that
he
had
been
arrested
on
this
breaking
and
entering,
and
she
called
the
public
defender's
office
about
8:00
o'clock
in
the
evening
to
get
an
attorney
for
him.
it
appears
that
brian
burbine
himself
had
an
appointment
with
a
public
defender
named
casparian
that
afternoon
at
4:
o0
o'clock,
but
he'd
been
unable
to
keep
the
appointment
because
of
his
arrest.
the
person
who
answered
the
phone
at
the
public
defender's
office
said
that
casparian
was
not
available,
but
she
got
another
attorney,
attorney
munson,
who
at
8:15
called
the
police
station
and
asked
if
brian
and
sparks,
the
other
man
with
him,
were
being
held.
she
said
she
asked
for
the
detective
division
and
somebody,
a
male
voice,
answered
"detectives",
said
that,
yes,
he
was
being
held.
she
said,
although
casparian
was
the
attorney
who
represented
burbine,
he
was
not
available,
but
if
he
was
to
be
placed
in
a
lineup
or
further
interrogated
that
evening
she
would
be
available.
the
answer
that
she
got,
she
testified,
was
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
further
interrogated
that
evening;
in
fact,
"we're
through
with
him
for
the
night.
"
at
this
point
she
did
not
pursue
the
conversation,
she
did
not
leave
any
instructions
as
to
burbine,
nor
did
she
ask
that
any
message
be
given
to
him.
and
in
fact,
burbine
was
never
told
about
this
telephone
call.
the
next
morning,
burbine
was
taken
to
the
cranston
police
district
court,
he
was
arraigned
and
he
was
handed
over
to
the
providence
police,
who
took
him
to
their
station,
gave
him
again
his
miranda
warnings.
he
again
signed
a
waiver,
gave
a
confession.
and
at
this
point
the
providence
police
said:
we're
going
to
get
an
attorney
for
you
because
you're
about
to
be
placed
in
a
lineup.
he
still
said
he
did
not
want
an
attorney.
but
at
this
time,
when
he
was
told
that
he
must
have
one,
he
mentioned
casparian's
name
and
the
public
defender's
office
was
contacted.
all
of
the
police
who
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
in
this
case,
the
cranston
detectives
and
the
providence
detectives,
claimed
that
they
had
not
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
attorney,
nor
did
they
know
anything
about
it.
at
the
suppression
hearing,
it
was
the
xx
position
that
this
call
had
never
been
made.
but
the
trial
judge
did
find
that
the
call
was
made
and
that
someone,
whomever
it
was,
had
received
this
call.
in
addition,
the
trial
court--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the
trial
justice
also
found
that
he
could
find
no
conspiracy
or
collusion
on
the
part
of
the
cranston
police
in
attempting
to
keep
burbine
from
an
attorney,
that
he
had
knowingly
waived
his
rights,
and
that
he
had
not
asked
for
an
attorney.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
that
he
did
not
ask
for
an
attorney,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
no,
he
did
not.
even
at
the
very
end,
when
he
was
giving
the
third
confession,
he
said
he
didn't
want
one,
but
the
police
insisted.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
well,
it
was...
yes,
because
now
he
was
going
to
be
placed
in
a
lineup.
at
his
trial--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
yes.
well,
he
told
brian
at
that
time:
it's
our
procedure
and
you
must
have
a
lawyer.
the
rhode
island...
he
was
convicted
at
a
jury
trial
of
first
degree
murder
of
mary
jo
hickey
and
then
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
upheld
the
conviction,
stating
that
the
miranda
rights
are
personal
rights
and
that
he
had
the
right
to
waive
them,
and
that
it
hardly
seemed
conceivable
to
them
that
an
attorney
whom
he
had
not
requested
if
he
had
known
about
it
would
have
gone
upon
his
information
necessary
to
make
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
rights.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
was.
the
federal
district
court,
giving
substantial
deference
to
the
state
court's
finding
of
historical
fact,
agreed
with
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
and
they
did
not
grant
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
the
first
circuit
court
reversed
and
they
gave
what
they
described
as
a
limited
ruling
when
they
said
deliberate
or
reckless
misleading
of
an
attorney
who
has
a
legitimate
professionally
ethical
interest
in
a
suspect
in
custody,
who
expresses
to
the
police
a
desire
to
be
present
at
any
interrogation
of
the
suspect,
combined
with
a
police
failure
to
communicate
that
exchange
to
the
suspect,
is
more
than
just
one
factor
in
the
calculus
of
waiver.
this
combination
of
circumstances,
the
first
circuit
said,
clearly
vitiates
any
claim
that
a
waiver
of
counsel
was
knowing
and
voluntary.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
do
you
mean...
excuse
me,
your
honor...
prior
to
his
arrest?
ms.
constance
l.
messore
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
really
understand
that.
i
think
if
he
had
an
attorney...
and
we
would
say
here
that
casparian
was
his
attorney...
and
then
he
was
arrested
and
brought
to
the
police
station,
that,
no,
the
police...
our
argument
would
be
that
the
attorney
had
no
right
at
that
particular
time
to
see
him
unless
he
himself
requested
the
attorney.
it's
our
argument
that
the
first
circuit
has--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--our
argument
would
be
the
same,
you
honor,
in
any
circumstances.
the
ruling
of
the
first
circuit
goes
beyond
the
purpose
of
miranda,
because
miranda
when
it
extended
into
the
police
station
these
procedural
safeguards
to
prevent
the
police
from
violating
a
suspect's
right
to
be
free
from
coerced
self-discrimination
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
fifth
amendment,
these
procedural
guidelines
and
miranda
rights
were
to
protect
his
rights
when
he
was
in
custody
and
when
he
was
being
subjected
to
interrogation.
but
they
were
also
to
provide
the
police
with
guidelines,
or
these
bright-line
rules,
as
they're
called,
which
could
be
readily
understood
and
easily
applied
by
the
police,
and
thereby
relieve
them
and
the
lower
courts
from
making
exceedingly
difficult
case
by
case
judgments
as
to
whether
a
particular
confession
was
voluntary.
the
police
are
required
to
give
the
well-known
miranda
warnings
and
any
time
that
they
did
not
give
these
warnings
obviously
his
confession
would
have
been
inadmissible.
but
these
miranda
warnings
are
not
themselves
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
they're
only
the
procedural
safeguards
designed
to
provide
a
practical
reinforcement
for
his
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
and
burbine
was
given
these
rights
verbally
at
least
three
times.
he
read
them,
he
said
he
understood
them,
he
said
that
he
was
able
to
read
fairly
well.
he
also
was
told
at
the
time
that
he
signed
the
confession.
the
questions
were
read
to
him.
he
would
answer
them
and
they
are
were
typed
by
the
police
as
the
questions
were
asked
and
read.
he
was
told
that
he
could
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
questioning
any
time
that
he
wished
to,
and
again,
do
you
understand
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
an
attorney,
and
he
said
yes.
so
our
is
that
he
certainly
well
understood
these
rights
before
he
signed
the
waiver
forms.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
well,
originally
in
the
state
court
it
was
argued
that
there
was
not,
and
i
believe
the
state
court
found
that
there
was
not.
but
when
the
federal
district
court
received
this
case,
apparently
for
rome
reason...
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
tactics
of
the
persons
that
handled
this
case...
they
decided
to
drop
that
argument.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
i
think
for
this
case
certainly
we'll
have
to
accept
that.
but
i
would
say
the
sixth
amendment
we
will
claim
does
not
apply
to
this
particular
case
because
adversarial
proceedings
had
not
yet
been
instituted
against
him.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
yes,
i
do.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
under
the
fifth
amendment--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--under
the
sixth
amendment,
yes,
i
think
until
the
adversarial
proceedings
or
a
lineup
have
been
instituted
against
him
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
that
attorney
unless
he
requests
the
attorney's
presence,
if
he
has
been
given
his
complete
miranda
rights,
of
course.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
we
don't
argue
that
he's
entitled
to
this
attorney
until
the
adversarial
proceedings
have
been
instituted,
whether
or
not
he
has
been
retained
in
the
past.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
i
think
i'm
bound
to
in
this
position,
your
honor,
because
the
state
when
this
case
went
before
the
federal
district
court
seemed
to
concede
that
issue,
that
there
was
an
attorney--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--well,
in
his
own
mind,
he
knew
he
had
an
appointment
with
an
attorney
that
afternoon.
he
certainly
knew
there
was
one
available
to
him
and
one
who
was
dealing
with
him
on
another
criminal
matter.
so
he
certainly
knew
that
there
was
an
attorney
available
and
he
knew
of
an
attorney
by
name.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
well,
he
didn't
request
him.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
at
this
particular
time--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--no,
he
didn't.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
yes.
all
the
courts
who
reviewed
this
case,
including
the
first
circuit,
found
that
this
was
a
valid
and
knowing
waiver
if
you
excluded
the
evidence
about
the
telephone
call.
but
the
first
circuit
is
the
first
court
that
felt
that
this
particular
call
changed
the
outlook
of
the
case.
the
police
neglect
in
telling
burbine
of
the
attorney's
call
was
not
an
inherently
coercive
action
directed
towards
him
which
could
produce
a
per
se
involuntariness
or
overbear
his
will
and
capacity
for
self-determination,
and
we
argue
that
any
fifth
amendment
situation
most
have
an
element
of
coercion
in
it
to
say
that
he
has
not
knowingly
and
willingly
waived
his
rights.
the
action
of
the
police
in
providing
this
information
to
the
attorney,
which
is
what
the
suspect
in
this
case
is
complaining
of,
we
say
was
not
improper
under
the
fifth
amendment,
because
even
the
first
circuit
said:
"our
analysis
being
on
the
suspect's
fifth
amendment
rights,
the
question
is
not
how
badly
counsel
was
misled,
but
the
effect
of
any
misrepresentations
on
the
knowingness
and
voluntariness
of
the
suspect's
waiver.
"
we
claim
that
the
miranda
rights
are
personal
rights
of
the
suspect.
as
long
as
he
is
given
the
miranda
warnings
which
are
required
by
this
court,
then
he
in
his
own
will
should
have
the
ability
to
waive
those
rights
and
he
does
not
need
the
added
advice
of
any
third
person,
whether
or
not
it
be
an
attorney.
we
would
like
to
mention--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--yes,
if
he
requests
one.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
whenever
he
does,
whenever
he
wants
it.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
it
says:
prior
to
questioning,
if
you
should
require
a
lawyer
we
will
see
that
one
is
appointed
for
you.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
if
he
is
to
be
interrogated.
the
requirement
of
the
lawyer--
ms.
constance
l.
messore
--that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
what
miranda
requires.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
the
serious
impact
we
feel
of
the
first
circuit's
ruling
is
the
loss
of
the
clearcut
rules
for
reviewing
the
admissibility
of
statements.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
two
i
believe
i'm
aware
of.
one
of
them
is
georgia
and
one
is
the
state
of
missouri.
we
feel
that
the
police
are
not
equipped
to
make
all
of
the
decisions
in
the
busy
police
station
that
would
be
required
of
them
by
the
ruling
of
the
first
circuit,
and
we
feel
that
therefore
the
first
circuit
has
expanded
the
ruling
of
miranda
by
requesting
that
the
call
of
an
attorney
be
put
through
to
the
suspect
even
though
he
has
been
warned
and
given
his
warnings
and
has
said
definitely
that
he
does
not
want
an
attorney.
we
would
therefore
ask
this
court
to
please
reverse
the
ruling
of
the
first
circuit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
l.
messore
i
have
no
further
rebuttal.
