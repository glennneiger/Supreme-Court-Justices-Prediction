mrs.
messore,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
police
required
a
lawyer
at
the
lineup--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--following
what
judges
have
told
them
they
must
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
they
have
waived
a
lawyer
earlier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey,
were
we
not
informed
that
a
rhode
island
case
holds
that,
or
is
it
just
a
policy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
there
was
reference
to
a
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
times
did
he
waive
and
how
many
times
did
he
confess
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
an
interrogation
room
is
theoretically
forbidding,
isn't
a
cell
block
a
little
more
forbidding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that's
generally
known
in
the
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
lawyers
or
to
laymen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
that
call
had
come
from
a
stranger
instead
of
from
his
sister?
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
total
stranger
hearing
about
the
circumstances
could
establish
an
attorney-client
relationship
between
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
you
think
it's
open
to
the
first
circuit
to
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
voluntariness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
instead
of
the
facts
you
just
recited,
the
policeman
came
into
burbine
and
said:
there
are
five
lawyers
out
here
that
would
like
to
represent
you;
do
you
want
one
of
them.
could
that
establish
an
attorney-client
relationship,
unless
he
said,
yes,
send
in
the
oldest
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
he
did
say,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
prior
occasions,
what
were
those?
you
mean
on
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fact
that
a
big
corporation
may
have
40
lawyers
in
their
legal
staff,
of
course
they're
getting
legal
advice
all
the
time...
but
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
on
the
court's
time,
not
your
time,
would
you
tell
me
this.
this
crime
was
committed
more
than
eight
years
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
has
this
man
been
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
one
minute
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
