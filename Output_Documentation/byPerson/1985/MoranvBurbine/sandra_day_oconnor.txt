justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
messore,
do
you
think
this
case
would
be
any
different
from
your
perspective
if
the
defendant
had
actually
engaged
an
attorney
or
had
reached
arrangements
with
someone
specifically
to
represent
him
and
the
police
acted
as
they
did
here
in
refusing
to
let
the
attorney
see
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
prior
to
the
questioning,
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
your
argument
be
the
same
regardless
of
the
degree
or
extent
of
the
deception
by
the
police?
is
there
any
point
at
which
you
would--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
even
if
you're
right
on
the
fifth
amendment
point,
what
about
the
sixth
amendment?
and
do
the
cases
of
this
court
leave
open,
in
your
view,
any
question
about
whether
the
sixth
amendment
protects
an
established
attorney-client
relationship
from
state
interference
with
it?
is
that
question
open?
you
want
us
to
assume
there
was
an
established
attorney-client
relationship
here,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
propose
that
we
treat
it
for
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment,
as
though
there
is
an
established
attorney-client
relationship
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
relying
on
gouveia.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
recognize
that
there
could
be
an
established
attorney-client
relationship
before
a
formal
proceeding
in
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
state
at
that
stage
is
free
to
interfere
with
that
relationship?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
had
thought
those
cases
were
dealing
with
when
an
attorney
had
to
be
provided,
but
had
not
decided
the
question
of
state
interference
with
an
existing
relationship
before
that
time
if
it
existed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
here
we
have
an
arrest
and
an
interrogation
and
an
attorney-client
relationship.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
concern
about
police
deception.
i
mean,
if
you're
right
it
would
he
preferable
for
the
police
to
say,
as
they
have
in
some
cases:
we
know
you're
the
attorney
for
mr.
jones
and
we
are
in
the
process
of
interrogating
him
and
you
can't
see
him.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
have
been
occasions
in
the
past,
i
guess,
when
the
court
has
stepped
in
out
of
its
concern
about
police
deception
under
the
rubric
of
due
process.
and
you
don't
see
that
as
being
a
source
of
any--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
mr.
mann,
would
this
case
be
different
in
your
view
if
the
police,
instead
of
being
deceptive,
if
they
were
here...
i'm
not
sure,
but
if
they
were...
if
they
had
just
said,
we're
talking
to
mr.
burbine
right
now
and
you
can't
see
him?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
could
she
have
done
and
what
right,
if
any,
would
be
violated,
and
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
said
no,
we're
talking
to
him
now,
you
cannot
see
him.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
grace,
so
to
speak,
or
was
it
compelled
by
some
constitutional
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
find
that
under
what
clause,
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mann,
could
we
go
back
for
a
minute
to
the
fact
that
the
state
court
made
an
express
determination
that
there
was
no
attorney-client
relationship
established.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
review
altered
that
finding.
was
that
finding
a
finding
of
fact
or
a
finding
to
which
the
federal
court
should
have
deferred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
it's
kind
of
your
classic
case
of
a
factual
determination.
was
there
an
attorney-client
relationship?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
it
was
a
question
of
state
law,
why
wouldn't
the
federal
court
defer
to
that?
it
just
struck
me
as
very
strange
that
the
federal
court
would
take
upon
itself
the
right
to
overturn
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
a
waiver
after
being
given
miranda
rights
would
also
constitute
a
waiver
of
any
sixth
amendment
right
he
might
have
had?
