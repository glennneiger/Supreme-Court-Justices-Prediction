mr.
robert
b.
mann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
brian
burbine's
lawyer,
allegra
munson,
called
the
cranston
police
station.
she
indicated
that
she
was
counsel,
and
we've
had
a
concession
that
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship.
she
said
that
she
would
make
herself
available
if
burbine
was
going
to
be
put
in
the
lineup
or
questioned.
and
she
was
told
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
questioned.
based
on
that
explicit
representation
that
they
were
through
with
brian
burbine
for
the
night,
she
took
no
further
action.
what
the
state
and
what
the
government
seek
to
do
in
this
case
is
erect
an
iron
curtain
between
the
client
and
his
or
her
attorney.
i
think
it's--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--well,
i
think
the
attorney...
yes,
it
would
be
different.
i
think
the
attorney
would
have
had
a
number
of
responses
she
could
have
made.
she
indicates
explicitly
on--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--what
could
she
have
done?
mr.
robert
b.
mann
if
she...
i
think
the
first
thing
she
could
have
done
was
she
could
have
asked
the
police
to
put
her
through
and
allow
her
to
speak
with
her
client.
it
would
seem
anomalous--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--the
next
step
she
probably
would
have
taken
is
she
probably
would
have
called
up
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
that
municipality
and
said,
i'm
being
denied
access
to
my
client.
that
is
in
fact
what
happened
to
me
about
two
months
ago
in
a
case
in
rhode
island.
i
called
the
city
solicitor
and
said:
a
lawyer
is
being
denied
access
to
the
client;
can
we
do
something
about
this
or
do
we
have
to
go
call
up
a
judge?
and
within
20
minutes
the
police
were
allowing
the
lawyer
access
to
the
client.
so
that's
the
first
step.
she
would
have
called
up
the
prosecuting
agency.
and
this
was
about
8:00
o'clock--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
think
it's
more
than
prosecutorial
discretion.
i
think
it
is
compelled
by
some
constitutional
consideration.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
think
it's
the
right...
i
think
it's
two
rights,
i
think
it's
at
least
the
right
of
the
client
to
be
informed
of
their
attorney's
availability.
that's
not
an
attorney's--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
concede
i
can't
find
a
case
that
explicitly
says
that.
i
obviously
can
start
with
escobedo,
that
talks
about
the
right
of
an
attorney's
access
to
a
client.
i
recognize
that
it's
been
limited.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
recognize
that
that's
a
significant
difference.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
sense,
no,
i
don't
have
a
case
that
i
can
point
you
to,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
one,
that
says
an
attorney
has
a
right
of
access
to
their
client,
at
least
not
pre-commencement
of
judicial
proceedings.
but
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
so
axiomatic
to
the
whole
process
under
which
we
operate
that
to
say
that
there
is
not
even
a
right
of
the
client
to
be
informed
of
the
client's
attorney...
and
we've
agreed
that
this
is
the
client's
attorney...
of
that
attorney's
availability
would
so
fundamentally
change
the
structure
of
things
that
it
would
really
change
the
way
we
operate.
it
would
say
that
once
we
get
a
client
into
the
police
station,
they
can
close
the
door
and
that's
it,
and
unless
the
client
calls
and
says
i
want
to
speak
to
my
lawyer
or
specifically
calls
that
lawyer,
there's
no
access
at
all
to
the
client.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
yes,
i
do.
but
i
don't
think
it's
just
because...
i
think
that
the
reason
the
first
circuit
found
that
it
was
involuntary
was
all
the
factors
that
went
into
considering
what
the
circumstances
were
when
he
made
his
confession.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
i
do
not
contend
it
is
a
determinative
fact.
i
contend
it
is
a
very
significant
fact.
i
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
first
circuit
opinion
that
it
was
only
because
of
the
failure
to
tell
the
client
about
the
attorney's
call.
they
took
into
consideration
a
number
of
factors
when
they
made
their
decision
that
the
waiver
was
not
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent.
they
certainly
focused
on
the
consequences
of
failing
to
inform
burbine
of
the
client's...
of
the
attorney's
call.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
he
confessed
three
times.
he
waived
three
times.
the
first
time...
and
plus,
there's
a
fourth
time
when
he
was
allegedly
informed
orally
of
his
rights.
they
didn't
get
a
signed
waiver.
i
understand
that's
not
critical
to
the
question.
and--
then
he
informed
them
of
his
name
and
his
address.
that
of
course
raises,
i
suppose,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
might
have
made
an
argument
that's
never
been
made
except
in
one
footnote
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
maybe
some
of
the...
two
arguments.
one
is
that
maybe
he
volunteered
statements;
or
secondly,
that
maybe
some
of
the
subsequent
confessions
might
have
been
admissible
even
if
the
first
one
or
two
weren't.
but
those
are
arguments
that
have
not
been
made,
i
would
suggest.
i
think
you
go
to
the
question
of
was
the
waiver
voluntary
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
full
set
of
circumstances.
and
i'd
like
to
at
least
illuminate
some
of
the
facts
that
i
think
are
critical
to
this
question.
when
burbine
was
arrested,
he
was
brought
into
the
police
station,
booked,
processed,
and
not
put
in
a
cell
block.
he
was
brought
up
to
an
interrogation
room,
and
the
clear
but
nonverbal
communication
of
that
was:
you're
going
to
be
interrogated.
he
was
put
in
that
interrogation
room
until
the
detective
went
in
and
started
questioning
him.
the
detective
went
in,
asked
him
a
question
about
his
name
and
where
he
lived.
he
says
he
gave
him
his
miranda
rights,
but
didn't
bother
getting
a
written
waiver.
at
that
point
the
detective
leaves.
burbine
is
still
kept
in
the
interrogation
room.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
in
the
cell
block
area.
they
had...
it's
their
discretion
where
to
put
him,
your
honor.
but
what
i
think
does
become
important
when
one
considers
all
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--but
a
cell
block
has
the
connotation,
if
you're
put
in
a
cell
block,
i
think
to
the
prisoner,
we're
done
with
you.
if
you're
put
in
one
of
these
interrogation
rooms...
and
the
record
is
clear
that--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
think
to
an
inmate...
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
think
to
the
person
who's
arrested,
your
honor,
who's
put
in
a
cell
block...
who
is
put
in
an
interrogation
room
right
off
the
main
room
where
the
detectives
are
working,
the
perception
is,
i'm
going
to
be
questioned.
the
perception
if
you're
thrown
in
the
tank,
so
to
speak,
is
different.
it's
not...
it's
only
one
factor,
i
would
agree
with
you,
and
it's
only
one
factor
in
all
of
the
factors
that
i
think
have
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
determining
whether
or
not
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
this
was
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver.
after
the
first
set
of
questions,
he
is
put
back
in,
he
is
put
back
into
the
interrogation
room.
it's
after
that
first
set
of
questions
at
about
4:30
or
5:00,
some
time
after
that,
that
the
providence
police
are
contacted.
then
around
7:30,
around
8:00
o'clock,
the
lawyer
makes
her
phone
call.
still
never
telling
the
client
about
the
telephone
call.
about
an
hour
later,
while
he's
still
in
that
interrogation
room...
and
i
think
at
that
point
it's
around
9:00
o'clock...
and
the
message
begins
to
get
clear
that
they're
pushing
this
guy
burbine
on
something.
he's
still
in
tbe
interrogation
room.
they
go
in
and
they
question
him.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
because
there
was
an
established
attorney-client
relationship.
it
would
have
been
different
if
there
had
not
been
an
established
attorney-client
relationship,
and
there
could
be
a
number
of
factors--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--no,
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
but
in
this
case,
the
call
was...
in
this
case,
there
were
two
factors
the
first
circuit
considered
in
concluding
that
there
was
an
established
attorney-client
relationship.
one
was
that
it
was
a
family
member
that
had
called
and
ask
this
specific
attorney
or
asked
this
office
to
become
engaged
in
representing
her
brother.
and
there
are
lots
of
the
state
court
opinions
that
have
discussed
this
issue
that
have
held
that
it's
appropriate
for
a
family
member
to
retain
counsel.
the
second
factor
that
the
first
circuit
considered
was
that
there
was
an
ongoing
relationship
between
this
office
and
this
client.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
think
it's
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
and
i
think
that
my
understanding
of
the
habeas
cases
is
that
that's
a
question
that
still
is
deserving
of
plenary
review
by
this
court.
i
understand
miller
versus
fenton
raises
that
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
it's
true
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
he
ever
did
anything
except
maybe
mumble
that
he
wanted
one
and
that
wasn't...
his
testimony
was
discredited,
your
honor.
so
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer,
and
in
fact
the
testimony
even
with
respect
to
the
lineup
question
is
that
he
said
he
didn't
want
a
lawyer.
i
might
briefly
respond
to
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier.
i
think
the
reason
for
the
question
about
the
lawyer
at
the
lineup
was
the
question,
the
issue
was
still
unsettled
under
rhode
island
constitutional
law,
and
it
was
finally
resolved
in
manner
similar
to
kirby
in
a
case
called
state
versus
delahunt.
but
that
i
think
explains
that.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
don't
believe
it
was
an
historical
finding
of
fact
to
which
sumner
versus
mata
deferral
is
required,
first
of
all.
i
think
certainly
the
historical
facts
are
that
the
sister--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--secondly,
what...
i
think
that
i
would
certainly
argue
that
it
is
a
legal
question
whether
or
not
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
decision
was
a
2-1-2
decision,
and
it
was
a
concurring
opinion
with
the
majority
opinion
that
talked
about
the
history
of
the
public
defender's
act
and
from
that
concluded
that
this
attorney
didn't
have
authority
to
represent
burbine.
but
i
would
submit
that
that
position
that
there
was
not
an
attorney-client
relationship
has,
as
mrs.
messore
has
conceded,
not
been
argued
all
the
way
through.
i
think
it
was
appropriate,
and
i
think
there
clearly...
if
one
looks
at
the
face,
there
clearly
was
enough,
certainly
compared
to
the
other
state
court
cases,
and
they've
all
found
an
attorney--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
it
was
a
question
of
state
law
whether
or
not
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship
with
respect
to
representing
this
client
in
a
criminal
case.
it
was
a
question
of
state
law
whether
or
not
it
was
appropriate
for
the
public
defender's
office
to
initiate
action
at
that
stage.
in
fact,
one
of
the
justices
in
dissent
found
that
the
attorney
was
acting
in
a
private
capacity.
whether
the
attorney
was
acting
privately
or
publicly...
and
i
think
you've
emphasized
in
your
cases
that
you're
not
going
to
draw
a
distinction
between
public
defender
attorneys
and
private
attorneys.
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
question
of
whether
or
not
this
attorney...
whether
or
not
this
client
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
whether
or
not
that
attorney-client
relationship
had
been
created,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
a
question
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
no.
and
i
didn't
mean
to
argue
that
if
i
did.
what
i
think
i
would
argue
is
that
whether
or
not
munson
was
acting
as
his
attorney,
as
burbine's
attorney
for
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
purposes,
that
there
was
no
question
of
her
right
at
that
point,
and
that
it's
a
federal
question
whether
or
not
she
was
acting
to
protect
his
federal
rights
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
think
that
is
a
federal
question,
at
least
in
the
context
of
an
interrogation
of
a
defendant
in
a
stationhouse
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
very
different.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
first,
i
don't
think
the
right...
independent
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
which
i
hope
to
address,
the
fifth
amendment
right
doesn't
attach
until
custodial
interrogation
begins.
in
that
case,
the
attorney
is
attempting
to--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--well,
but
had
the
attorney
been
told
it
was
going
to
begin,
then
the
attorney
said
she
would
have
acted
differently.
and
they
said,
we're
through
with
burbine
for
the
night.
i
think
that
the
question--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--but
i
think
that's
different
for
another
reason,
too.
the
public
defender's
office
in
that
case
has
no
right
to
say
that
about
people
who
are
about
to
be
arrested.
they
have
no
more
right
than
a
private
lawyer
to
solicit
clients
who
are
in
the
future
going
to
commit
a
crime.
and
in
this
case,
it
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
this
existing
relationship
and
the
client
had
already
been--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--it
wouldn't
in
this
case,
but
i
admit
it
gets
closer.
it
wouldn't
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
this
office
also
had
this
prior
relationship
with
burbine.
and
you
add
those
two
factors
together
and
you
have
an
ongoing
relationship.
i
think
it
wouldn't
if
it
were
a
friend
that
called
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i'm
sorry?
who
might
have
talked?
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
the
record
is
barren
on
that
point,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
who
calls
the
lawyer
in
the
first
instance?
mr.
robert
b.
mann
oh,
i
don't
think
it's
the
province
of
the
police
to
inquire
as
to
how
an
attorney-client
relationship
is
established,
and
certainly
how
attorney-client
relationships
are
established,
at
least
in
those
first
few
hours
after
arrest,
are
varied
and
not
with
written
retainer
agreements.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
maybe
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
well,
the
testimony,
sir,
was
that
she
called,
got
the
police
station,
asked
for
detectives,
there
was
a
switching
sound,
somebody
picked
up
on
the
phone
and
the
answer
was
"detectives".
mr.
robert
b.
mann
well,
that's
the
gap
in
the--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--well,
i
would
argue
that
that
became
a
question
factfinding.
the
trial
justice
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
telephone
call
had
been
made.
the
state
argued
very
strongly
throughout
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
telephone
call
by
the
attorney
had
not
been
made,
that...
to
believe
the
three
police
officers.
the
state
in
rebuttal
in
the
supression
hearing
put
on
the
senior
police
officer
at
the
suppression
hearing
to
establish
that
the
call
could
not
have
been
made.
and
the
state's
argument
was,
stripped
of
nice
words,
that
the
attorney
was
lying.
and
the
trial
justice
didn't
accept
that
argument,
and
the
trial
justice
accepted
the
fact...
and
i
think
that
that's
a
finding
of
fact
that
is
now
controlling
in
the
case...
that
the
call
was
made.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
the
trial
justice
does
not
say
explicitly
in
his
relatively
short
opinion
that
it
was
made
to
the
detective
division,
but--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--no,
there's
no
plate
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
well,
first
i
would
argue
that
the
question
of
whether...
that
whether
or
not
there's
an
attorney-client
relationship
is
not
the
same
kind
of
historical
fact
that
mandates--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--i
think
it's
at
least
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
it
is
at
least,
it
seems
to
me...
we
have
the
historical
facts
on
which
we
can
make
that
decision.
we
know
that
the
call
was
made
by
the
sister,
that
attorney
one
called
attorney
two,
that
munson
called
the
police
station,
that
there
was
a
prior
relationship.
based
on
those
facts,
it
seems
to
me
it's
at
least
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
whether
or
not
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no.
burbine
has
the
absolute
right
to
say
he
doesn't
want
a
lawyer.
we've
never
argued
for
the
new
york
rule--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--but
he
was
never
informed
of
his
lawyer's
call,
and
i
think
that
the
question
is
how
important
is
that
piece
of
information
and
does
it
matter?
and
i
think,
for
example,
that
certainly
when
the
police
are
dealing
with
a
client
alone...
and
i'm
obviously
referring
to
a
footnote
by
justice
white,
where
you
have
discussed,
sir,
that
when
the
police
are
dealing
with
an
individual
unrepresented
by
counsel,
there's
a
greater
obligation
to
inform
the
client,
to
keep
the
client
abreast
of
what's
taking
place.
the
question
is
would
this
have
mattered
in
this
context,
when
you
consider
all
of
the
factors
that
existed
that
night?
i
should...
in
discussing
whether
or
not
was
voluntary,
there
are
certain
other
facts
that
i'd
like
to
bring
out.
there
has
not
been
much
discussion
of
burbine's
condition
when
he
finally
made
the
confession.
he
basically
broke
down.
what
happened
was
that
he
was
clearly,
by
the
state's
own
testimony,
the
state's
witnesses,
he
was
very
nervous,
he
was
shaking,
he
was
tearful.
this
was
a
man
clearly
on
the
edge,
and
the
question
is
would
it
have
made
a
difference
to
have
told
him
this?
this
was
a
person
who
didn't
confess
until
about
9:20
in
the
evening
after
having
been
held
in
one
of
these
interrogation
rooms
from
about
3:00
o'clock
on.
this
is
different,
it
seems
to
me,
than
the
situation
in
mosley,
where
you
had
the
client
being
questioned
about
a
separate
crime
in
a
separate
location
by
different
officers.
here
you
had
the
client
kept
in
the
same
interrogation
room,
questioned
by
the
same
officers
or
officers
working
in
tandem,
about
the
same
crime,
time
after
time,
never
yet,
never
once
telling
him
about
his
attorney's
call.
i
think
the
first
circuit
opinion
addresses
clearly
what
the
effects
of
the
call
would
have
been
on
burbine.
it
wouldn't
have
just
told
him
that
there
was
an
attorney
available.
it
would
have
told
him
that
he
wasn't
isolated.
it
would
have
communicated
to
him,
albeit
indirectly,
that
his
family
was
with
him.
it
would
have
told
him
that
the
police
were
saying
one
thing
to
an
attorney
and
another
thing
to
him,
and
that
was
that--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--yes,
sir,
there
were.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
i
don't,
i
think,
other
than
to
some
extent
escobedo.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
think
the
effect
was
to
place
incredible
pressure
on
him,
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it's
not
tantamount,
i
would
agree,
to
the
kind
of
factual
situation
that
existed
in
miller
versus
fenton.
he
didn't
collapse
out
of
unconsciousness.
on
the
other
hand,
he
broke
down.
he
was
crying.
he
was...
this
is
their
own,
the
police
description
of
him.
he
was
shaking.
he
was
very
nervous.
i
think
he
was
kept
in
this
interrogation
room
for
about
six
hours.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that
characterization.
i
think
the
question
is,
at
the
time
when
he
finally
broke
and
gave
his
first
confession
about
9:20
at
night,
what
was
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
events
that
had
transpired?
and
it
was
not
a
grilling.
the
first
questioning
was
very
short.
the
second
questioning
was
very
short.
but
the
cumulative
effect,
i
would
suggest,
was
significant.
even
the
united
states
government
has
suggested
in
its
brief,
i
think,
that,
in
footnote
16,
that
they
suggested
that
maybe
it
makes
sense
to
keep
successive
police
officers
more
informed
when
a
person
invokes
their
right
to
silence
and
maybe
the
effect
of
not...
of
successive
questioning
on
the
client
may
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
a
right,
of
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
silence.
here
burbine
had
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
police
on
two
prior
occasions.
he
had
totally
denied
involvement.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
no,
on
this
case,
on
this
case.
at
4:30
to
5:00,
he
didn't
even
sign
the
waiver
of
rights
form
that
was
supposedly
read
to
him.
at
about
9:00
o'clock,
he
signs
the
waiver
of
rights
form,
denies
his
involvement.
and
then
he
comes,
then
a
third
time
finally
he
comes
around.
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
sixth
amendment
argument
or
sixth
amendment
question
that
has
been
raised,
if
i
could.
if
you
accept
that
there
was
an
attorney-client
relationship
in
this
case,
i
think
as
i
understand
gouveia
what
it
stands
for
is
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
before
the
commencement
of
formal
judicial
proceedings.
but
in
fact
one
of
the
points
made
in
gouveia
was
that
the
prisoners
had
access
to
counsel,
that
they
had
the
ability
to
communicate
with
counsel.
and
i
would
read
implicit
in
that
the
fact
that
you
could
create
an
attorney-client
relationship
before
the
commencement
of
formal
proceedings.
whether
or
not
you
have
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
is
a
separate
question
and
that's
not
the
issue
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
clearly
criminal
defendants
or
targets
of
criminal
investigations
routinely
establish
attorney-client
relationships
long
before
the
commencement
of
attorney-client
relationships.
certainly
that's
true
in
almost
any
white
collar
case,
almost
any
federal
prosecution.
the
negotiations
with
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
commence
long
before
the
initiation
of
formal
charges.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
well,
i
think
the
question...
we
have
also
argued--
mr.
robert
b.
mann
--it
has
this,
i
think
it
has
this
to
do.
the
question
is
this:
does
burbine
also
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
and
we've
argued
that
he
does.
and
could
that
right
attach
even
though
formal
judicial
proceedings
had
not
been
commenced
other
than
the
arrest
of
burbine?
and
if
it
did
attach...
and
we
argue
that
it
does...
then
there
was
also,
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
an
interference
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
by
denying
him
access,
by
denying
his
lawyer
access
to
him
at
least
to
communicate
with
him.
now,
clearly
burbine
continued
to
have
the
right
to
waive
even
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
without
his
lawyer
being
present.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
but
the
reason
i
think
it's
relevant
is
that
we
have
also
argued
that
he
has
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
independent
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
he
has
because
the
custodial
interrogation
had
commenced
pursuant
to,
under
miranda.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
i
don't
think
the
standard
would
be
the
same,
though
oftentimes
similar
language
has
been
used.
as
i
understood,
the
question
is,
certainly
with
respect
to
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
the
sixth
amendment
waiver,
there'd
be
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver.
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment,
the
same
thing.
with
respect
to
violation
of
miranda...
of
one
of
the
rights
generated
by
miranda,
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
same
standard
would
apply.
i
would
argue
that
certainly
for
a
sixth
amendment
waiver
you
would
need
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
type
of
waiver.
now,
in
this
case
we've
argued
all
the
way
through
that
it
didn't
exist,
but
if
you
had
a
waiver
that
was
a
fifth
amendment
at
least
in
this
case
i
don't
see
the
difference.
if
you
had
a
waiver
that
was
only
with
respect
to
miranda
rights
as
opposed
to
the
fifth
amendment
question,
then
i
could
see
a
difference
and
a
higher
standard
question
imposed
with
respect
to
the
waiver
of
sixth
amendment
rights.
i
think
that
there
is
a
single
point
on
which
i'd
like
to
conclude.
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
have
both
said
that
there
is
no
limit,
there
is
no
limit
or
no
effect
to
the
endless
deception
that
could
be
committed,
and
that's
an
incredible
comment,
it
seems
to
me.
nowhere
has
the
state,
nowhere
has
the
united
states
government,
ever
suggested
that
there
is
any
limit
to
the
deception
that
could
be
visited
either
on
the
client
or
on
the
lawyer.
there
was
deception
of
the
lawyer
in
this
case,
but
there
was
at
least
also
implicit
deception
to
the
client
by
not
telling
the
client
what
was
going
on,
by
not
telling
the
client
about
the
attorney's
call.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
but
i
think
as
an
effective
means
of
deterring
that
kind
of
deception
you
have
traditionally
used
the
deterrent,
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
tucker
you
indicated,
michigan
versus
tucker,
i
think
you
indicated
that
it
would
be
applicable
in
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
fourth
amendment
cases,
even
if
it's
not
applicable
in
good
faith
cases,
in
that
case
you
indicated
that
at
least
in
cases
where
the
conduct
rose
to
the
level
of
negligence
or
something
more
culpable.
and
in
this
case,
the
level
was
even
beyond
that.
it
was
either
deliberate
deception
or
reckless
indifference.
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
the
only
way
to
deter...
not
the
only
way.
certainly
there
are
civil
rights
lawsuits,
there
are
others,
disciplinary
proceedings,
as
you
suggested,
sir.
but
certainly
one
of
the
traditional
ways
and
perhaps
from
burbine's
perspective
the
only
way
that
matters
to
deter
that
kind
of
behavior
is
to
utilize
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
well,
the
representation
that
they
were
not
going
to
question
him
and
the
representation
that
they
were
through
with
him
for
the
night.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
absolutely,
because
the
attorney
relied
on
that.
the
police
were
free
to
say,
we
can't
tell
you
what
we're
going
to
do
and
we
can't
make
a
decision.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
mann
burbine
has
been
incarcerated.
he
was
denied
bail
during
the
pendency
of
this
proceeding
and
he
is
currently
incarcerated
in
a
maximum
security
facility.
