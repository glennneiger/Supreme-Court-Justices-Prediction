justice
thurgood
marshall
at
any
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
at
that
state
they
said
you
have
to
have
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
the
difference
between
them
not
producing
the
lawyer
and
insisting
that
he
take
a
lawyer
was
the
confession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
tell
him
in
the
miranda
that
you
will
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'll
give
him
a
lawyer
right
then,
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
when
you
first
give
him
miranda
warnings,
you
will
give
him
a
lawyer
if
he
wants
one
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
give
him
one
until
he's
being
interrogated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
interrogation
was
in
miranda
at
all.
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
include
escobedo
in
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
escobedo
the
lawyer
was
in
the
building
trying
to
get
to
the
man
and
they
kept
him
from
getting
to
him.
wasn't
that
escobedo?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
he
said
he
wanted
one.
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
he
never
asked
for
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
that
it
matters
at
all,
because
you
don't
know
who
they
talked
to.
they
might
have
talked
to
the
third
janitor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
they
called
the
police
station,
who
did
they
talk
to?
they
talked
to
a
man
who
said
"detectives".
they
don't
know
who
they
talked
to.
until
today
we
don't
know
who
they
talked
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
difference
does
it
make
who
called?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
applies
to
this
party,
because
you
don't
know
who
it
went
to.
i
would
assume
that
you
have
to
put
this
information
in
the
hands
of
the
detectives
who
were
questioning
him.
you
don't
even
get
close
to
that.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
call
that
was
made
advising
the
"police
department"
that
he
had
a
lawyer,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
was
given
that
information?
you
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
was
the
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
know
until
today.
so
how
can
we
hold
anybody
responsible
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
anybody
else
say
to
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
know
whom
is
yet,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
get
it.
outside
of
the
fact
that
the
police
were
questioning
him,
what
other
acts
made
it
such
a
deception?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
if
the
police
said,
we're
through
with
you
for
the
night,
and
then
questioned
you
after
that,
that's
deception?
