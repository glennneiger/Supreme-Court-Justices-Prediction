mr.
robert
e.
manley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
to
a
certain
extent
this
case
can
be
characterized
as
the
opposite
of
the
tuttle
case
which
this
court
decided
several
months
ago.
here
we
do
not
have
low
level
policemen
going
off
on
a
frolic
of
their
own
to
violate
constitutional
rights.
we
have
the
opposite.
we
have
patrolmen
and
deputy
sheriffs
who
have
grave
reservations
about
the
propriety
of
their
chopping
down
a
door
in
order
to
search
a
private
doctor's
office
without
a
search
warrant,
armed
only
with
an
order
to
attach
the
bodies
of
people
who
may
or
may
not
be
inside
and
who
are
not
the
owners
of
the
premises.
because
of
these
grave
reservations,
they
summoned
for
instructions
from
their
superiors.
ultimately,
their
superiors
referred
the
problem
on
up
to
the
county
prosecutor,
who
is
an
elected
official,
and
who
is--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
he
is
the
policymaker
in
terms
of
legal
matters
for
the
county,
because
the
statute
under
which--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--he
can
instruct
county
agencies
what
to
do.
the
statute
expressly
gives
him
authority
to
instruct
county
agencies
what
to
do.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
the
matter
before
this
court
only
involves
the
county
of
hamilton.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
the
hamilton
county
deputy
sheriffs.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
trial
court
with
respect
to
the
city
of
cincinnati,
so
the
only
issue
is
whether
or
not
hamilton
county
has
exposure
for
this
unconstitutional
invasion.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
in
this
particular--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
i
don't
know
that
he
can
do
that
to
the
chief
of
the
cincinnati
police
department.
i
think
he
can
do
it
to
the
deputy...
the
sheriff's
department
under
the--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--no,
the
sheriff
is
elected,
and
his
line
authority,
but
we
have
a
peculiar
statute
in
ohio.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
expressly
gives
them
the
authority
to
give
instructions.
it
is
ohio
revised
code
section
309.08
and
9,
and
it
gives
him--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--it
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
2.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
i
am
not
certain
whether
it
is
quoted.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
it
is
also
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
footnote
1
at
page
8
where
it
is
set
forth,
the
language
is
set
forth.
so
that
we
are
in
a
situation
where
the
county
prosecutor
has
been
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
a
policymaker,
and
under
the
procedure
of
referring
questions...
the
sheriff
has
a
policy
to
refer
questions
of
this
sort
to
the
prosecutor.
it
is
referred
to
him,
and
he
says
go
in
and
get
them.
he
gives
them
instructions
to
go
in
and
get
them.
the
deputies,
when
they
get
these
instructions,
tell
dr.
pembaur,
doctor,
please
open
the
door,
because
if
you
don't,
we
are
going
to
have
to
break
it
down,
because
the
prosecuting
attorney
told
us
to
go
in
and
get
them.
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
sheriffs
or
deputy
sheriffs
as
shown
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
they
were
operating
under
instructions
from
the
county
prosecutor,
who
is
a
policymaker
for
hamilton
county
in
areas
of
his
authority,
and
who
is
obligated
under
ohio
law
to
give
instructions
to
county
departments,
including
the
sheriff's
department,
and
he
gave
instructions.
the
instructions
were
followed,
and
as
a
consequence
the
door
was
chopped
down,
and
the
search
was
conducted
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
it
was
a
joint
exercise.
the
sheriffs
arrived.
later
city
police
arrived.
the
sheriffs
attempted
to
break
the
door
down
without
success.
this
lasted
for
two
hours.
the
sheriffs
sat
around
for
two
hours
waiting
to
act
until
they
got
the
instructions
from
the
county
prosecutor.
they
put
their
shoulders
to
the
door.
it
didn't
budge,
so
the
police
took
an
ax
and
sledgehammer
and
broke
it
down.
then
the
sheriffs
went
in
and
conducted
the
search.
i
forget
whether
the
policemen
went
in
or
not,
but
i
believe
they
did.
but
the
sheriffs
were
responsible
for
conducting
the
search.
the
police
were
there
under
a
city
policy
to
assist
the
sheriffs.
and
in
this
situation,
as
i
read
tuttle,
a
policy
is
the
selection
of
alternative
courses
of
action,
and
in
this
particular
situation
the
prosecutor
was
apprised
of
the
situation.
he
knew
he
could
have...
had
plenty
of
time
to
get
a
search
warrant,
because
there
was
a
two-hour
interval
between
the
arrival
of
the
sheriffs
and
the
time
of
the
breakdown,
during
which
time
the
doctor
served
the
sheriffs
tea
from
the
window.
it
was
not
a--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--no,
i
did
not
say
that.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
that
particular
question.
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
the
county
prosecutor
is
a
policymaking
official
in
this
area
of
activity,
and
did
say
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
doctor
were
in
fact
violated,
but
found
that
there
was
no
policy
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
failure
to
implement
the
county
prosecutor's
position
more
than
once.
and
here,
i
believe
the
sixth
circuit
has
confused
two
lines
of
cases.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--i
believe,
there
again,
as
i
read
monell
and
owen,
we
have
a
county
policy
when
the
person
who
has
the
authority
acts,
and
if
he
has
the
authority
to
take
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
county,
that
thereby
becomes
policy.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
a
single
action.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
owen.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
fact
concerts.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
it
was
a
single
action.
that
was
the
only
time
they
ever
fired
a
city
manager
without
due
process.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
i
believe
that
it
is
defined
in
tuttle
as
the
selection
from
alternative
courses
of
action,
and
here
the
county
prosecutor
had
the
option
of
getting
a
search
warrant...
the
county
courthouse
was
five
minutes
away...
telling
the
deputy
sheriffs
to
secure
the
area
and
wait
for
them
to
leave
at
the
close
of
the
business
day
if
they
were
there,
or
having
the
deputy
sheriffs
go
out
to
the
homes
of
the
individuals,
which
is
where
the
capiases
were
addressed.
you
know,
the
record
shows
that
the
capias
for
dr.
maulden
was
issued
20
days
before
the
break
in.
they
had
20
days
in
which
to--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--the
county
attorney
adopted...
did
two
things.
first
of
all,
he
articulated
what
both
he
and
the
sheriff
believed
to
be
the
long-standing
policy
of
the
county.
namely,
you
can
break
down
a
door
to
make
an
arrest,
and
that
is
based
upon
an
ohio
statute
which
says
you
can
break
down
a
door
to
make
an
arrest.
it
is
based
upon
a
sixth
circuit
decision
i
believe
mckinney,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
but
that
sixth
circuit
decision
refers
to
an
arrest
where
there
has
been
a
warrant
issued
for
arrest
for
a
crime.
this
is
a
capias,
a
body
attachment,
an
order
that
a
notary
public
can
issue
in
the
state
of
ohio
without
any
kind
of
prior
judicial
review,
and
of
course
this
court
in
steagald
has
clearly
indicated
what
the
county
thought
the
policy
was
was--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
it
had
never
been
written
down.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
the
record
shows
that
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
testified
that
they
had
served
capiases
on
third
party--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--on
a
capias?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
with
a
search
warrant,
but
not
without
a
search
warrant.
there
is
no
case
that
i
can
find
that
says
that
you
can
use
a
capias--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--steagald
held
that
you
cannot
use
an
arrest
warrant
as
a
substitute,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
an
arrest
warrant.
we
are
talking
about
a
capias,
which
is
a
different
kind
of
breed
of
cat
under
ohio
law.
it
is
not...
in
the
mckinney
case
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
you
have
extraordinary
circumstances
because
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
you
don't
have
any
of
that
with
respect
to
a
capias.
any
witness
who
doesn't
appear
is
subject
to
being
picked
up
as
in...
after
the
manner
of
a
forthwith
subpoena,
and
that
kind
of
an
order
can
be
even
issued,
as
i
say,
by
a
notary
public,
without
any
kind
of
prior
judicial
determination
that
there
is
probable
cause
that
there
has
been
a
crime
committed,
so
that
is
an
entirely
different
thing,
and
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
you
can
use
a
capias
as
a
substitute
for
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
that
is
correct,
but
you
see,
there,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
waylan
is
subject
to
a
good
faith
immunity
defense,
whereas
owen
is...
under
owen
the
county
is
not.
so
that
waylan
can
be
honestly
mistaken,
and
be
free
of
any
liability,
but
the
county
does
not
have
a
good
faith
immunity
defense,
and
so
that...
but
the
mckinney
case
involved
an
arrest
warrant,
not
a
search
warrant,
but
not
a
capias.
there
is
no
case
that
we
have
found
where
a
capias
has
been
used
as
a
substitute
for
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
they...
having
failed
with
their
shoulders,
a
policeman
went
to
a
nearby
firehouse
and
acquired
an
ax
and
a
sledgehammer,
again
demonstrating--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--after
he
called
the
prosecutor,
and
so
there
would
have
been
enough
time
at
that
period
to
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
they
didn't
discuss
that
distinction.
they
just
assumed--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
they
announced
that
mckinney
would
justify
this.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
all
right.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
assuming
that
were
the
correct
view
of
federal
constitutional
law,
with
which,
of
course,
i
don't
agree,
then
that
still
makes
the
sixth
circuit
incorrect
in
its
determination
of
the
case
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
but
that
does
not
excuse
the
county
from
liability.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
of
owen.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
there
was.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
particular
search,
nothing
was
seized,
nothing
was
found.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
in
this
particular
situation,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
anything
revolutionary
about
the
concept
that
you
should
not
break
down
a
door
without
a
search
warrant.
certainly
in
steagald
the
court
made
it
clear
that...
this
court
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
pioneering.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
for
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
this
is
not...
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
policy
enunciated
in
the...
by
congress
in
the
act
of
1871.
it
defeats
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
discourage
people
from
using
the
color
of
law
from
violating
constitutional
rights.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
in
other
circuits
the
law
was
to
the
contrary.
we
cited
those
in
our
briefs.
the
sixth
circuit
was
by
far
a
minority
viewpoint.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
i
do
not
think
it
is
essential
for
us
to
win,
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
of
1871
statute
is
to
deter
this
kind
of
behavior
on
the
part
of
people--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--i
believe
the
compensatory
aspects
of
1983
are
retroactive.
i
believe
they
are
retroactive.
and
owen
is
a
situation
where
it
was
retroactive,
and
owen
goes
on
to
explain
in
great
detail
why
it
should
be
retroactive,
and
it
refers
by...
incorporates
or
quotes
the
case
from
boston.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--that
is
exactly
what
the
sheriff
testified
to,
that
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
this
was
permissible--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
at
that
particular
time
it
was
the
sheriff's
belief
and
the
county
prosecutor's
belief
that
this
was
a
lawful
course
of
action.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
the
prosecutor
was
articulating
what
both
he
and
the
sheriff
believed
to
have
been
the
longstanding
policy
as
incorporated
in
the
statutes
of
ohio
and
as
reflected
in
the
mckinney
case.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
i
believe
they
were
mistaken.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
they
were
mistaken.
that
is
correct.
and
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
policymaker
doing
one
of
two
things,
either,
a,
articulating
a
longstanding
practice
or
policy,
what
was
believed
to
be
the
lawful
course
of
action
in
his
official
capacity
as
the
county
prosecutor,
or
taking
an
act
which
constitutes
policy.
in
either
event,
he
is
shaping
policy
for
the
county,
and
that
policy
directly
resulted
in
breaking
down
the
door
and
the
illegal
search
without
a
search
warrant,
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
reversed,
and
that
the
county
should
be
held
accountable
for
the
implementation
of
this
policy
in
breaking
down
the
door
and
searching
the
premises
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
that
is
why
i
started
to
say
the
sixth
circuit,
i
think,
got
off
on
the
wrong
track,
but
if
you
are
trying
to
prove
policy
by
means
of
a
longstanding
practice
or
custom,
i
think
you
have
to
show
more
than
one
time,
repeated
occurrences,
and
maybe
even
as
in
rizzo
20
cases
is
not
enough.
but
on
the
other
hand,
a
policy
doesn't
have
to
be
proven
by
circumstantial
evidence.
a
policy
can
be
proven
by
the
statements
or
the
writings
or
the
actions
of
a
policymaker.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
a
single
act
by
a
policymaker
in
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
there
is
nothing
like
that
here,
but
for
this
particular
area
of
activity,
the
governing
body
has...
county
commissioners
would
have
no
power
to
pass
such
a
resolution.
the
only
people
that
have
the
power
to
set
policy
in
this
area
are
either
the
county
prosecutor
or
the
county
sheriff,
and
they
work
together
as
a
team.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
or
a
policy
manual.
but
there
is
a
state
statute
that
says
you
may
break
down
a
door
to
effect
an
arrest,
and
then
you
get
into
an
ambiguity,
does
that
apply
to
capiases
or
not,
so
that
certainly
they
were
following,
and
they
relied
upon
this
state
statute
throughout
the
multiple
appellate
processes
in
various
courts,
so
to
that
extent
the
statute
was
articulating
a
policy
that
applied
in
the
county
and
was
implemented
by
the
county
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
happily,
we
don't
have
that
situation,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
assistant
prosecutor
would
have
done.
i
knew
that
if
i
had
been
assistant
prosecutor,
i
think
i
would
have
said,
wait
15
minutes
and
i
will
come
up
with
a
search
warrant,
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
county
prosecutor
has
a
policy
of
leaving
an
assistant
in
charge
if
he
is
absent.
some
organizations
do.
so
i
really
don't
know
what
facts
in
the
record
would
make
it
possible
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
well,
that
is
not
correct.
the
assistant
prosecutor
could
have
looked
at
the
ohio
statute,
and
if
he
had,
he
would
have
said,
based
upon
the
ohio
statute,
break
down
the
door.
he
could
have
discussed
it
with
the
county
sheriff,
who
would
have
said,
well,
it
is
our
policy
to
use
force
to
effect
an
arrest,
failing
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
capias
and
an
arrest
warrant,
so
that
if
he
had
done
that,
it
would
not
have
fallen
under
the
single
act
policy
formation.
it
would
have
fallen
under
the
articulation
of
a
longstanding
policy
as
reflected
in
the
ohio
revised
code,
and
as
reflected
in
the
custom
of
the
sheriff's
department.
so
that
far
he
could
have
gone,
but
i
just...
what
i
am
having
difficulty
with
is
whether
or
not,
if
those
other
things
were
not
present,
would
he
be
able
by
a
single
act
to
be
able
to
create
a
new
policy,
and
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
a
few
matters.
initially,
mr.
justice
stevens
raised
a
question
of
a
dialogue
between
the
sheriff
and
the
prosecutor.
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
that
dialogue
took
place.
i
uncovered
no
evidence
of
it.
but
the
functional
equivalent
of
it
took
place
in
that
after
the
event,
the
sheriff
caused
a
complete
investigation
to
be
made,
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
sheriff
approved
the
advice
that
his
people
got
from
the
county
prosecutor,
and
indicated
that
what
his
people
did
was
completely
consistent
with
the
policies
of
his
office
at
that
time,
so
that
while
we
don't
have
the
conversation
that
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
we
have
the
functional
equivalent.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
i
don't
recall
if
they
did.
mr.
robert
e.
manley
i
do
not
recall
if
they
did.
i
believe
that
the
act
of
1871
was
passed
in
light
of
the
common
law
at
that
time,
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
owen
and
certainly
the
thayer
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
and
footnote
1
in
owen
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
where
you
have
governmental
liability,
the
mere
fact
that
the
law
is
unclear
at
the
time
that
the
policy
is
made
or
implemented
should
not
protect
or
shift
the
cost
to
the--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
if
the
law
were
clear
but
the
other
way...
well,
the
law--
mr.
robert
e.
manley
--well,
then
we
are
in
a
situation
where,
as
happened
here,
this
court
then
announces
that
what
people
may
have
thought...
what
the
police
thought
the
law
was
was
not
the
law,
and
the
same
principle
enunciated
in
thayer
and
owen
should
apply
in
that
situation
for
the
same
reason,
that
the
burden
should
not
be
dumped
on
the
innocent
citizen,
it
should
be
shared
by
all
the
taxpayers
who
perpetrate
the
wrong.
for
these
reasons,
if
the
court
please,
we
respectfully
request
the
sixth
circuit
be
reversed.
