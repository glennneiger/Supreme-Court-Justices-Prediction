i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
if
this
were
the
third
occurrence,
it
might
be
a
different
situation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
answer
them
both.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then,
the
fact
it
is
a
first
occurrence
really
isn't
very
relevant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
it
have
been
issued,
as
your
opponent
says,
by
a
notary
public?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
say
two
separate,
you
mean
one
for
each
of
the
witnesses?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
go
to
one
judge,
and
then
you
go
down
the
hall
to
another
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
title
of
the
case
here
is
a
little
peculiar,
isn't
it,
with
the
city
of
cincinnati
as
the
lead
name
on
the
down
side?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
city
a
party
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
under
our
rules
they
might
be
classified
as
a
respondent.
