justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
on
that
score,
supposing
just
before
these
phone
calls
took
place,
the
sheriff
and
the
prosecutor
talked
to
one
another
and
said,
what
will
we
do
in
this
case,
and
instead
of
just
saying,
go
ahead
and
break
in,
they
had
said,
well,
i
think
in
cases
like
this
we
should
break
in,
and
then
they
went
ahead
and
broke
in,
would
it
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
said,
we
should
adopt
a
policy
for
cases
like
this,
we
should
break
in,
and
we
should
do
it
today.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
sheriff
and
the
prosecutor
talk
it
over
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
his
advice
is,
i
think
in
cases
like
this
you
should
break
in,
and
he
says,
i
agree,
in
cases
like
this
we
will
break
in.
would
there
be
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
not
an
arrest
warrant,
a
capias.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
answer
my
question
if
you
would.
supposing
they
said
exactly
what
i
gave
to
you,
that
the
sheriff
says
to
the
prosecutor,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do,
and
he
says,
i
think
in
cases
like
this
you
should
break
in,
the
sheriff
says,
i
agree,
that
is
what
i
will
tell
the
officers
to
do.
would
that
then
be
a
policy
that
would
be
actionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
county
be
responsible?
what
do
you
mean,
at
that
time?
i
would
suppose
justice
stevens
would
ask
you
the
same
question.
suppose
it
was
done
today,
after
steagald.
the
sheriff
goes
to
the
prosecutor
and
says,
what
should
we
do,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
well,
let's
forget
that
steagald
case,
let's
just...
this
is
a
policy
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
with.
what
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
difference
is,
they
didn't
say,
what
will
we
do
in
cases
like
that?
they
said,
what
will
we
do
in
this
case?
that
is
the
only
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
is
a
policy,
and
one
is
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
fair
to
say
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
policymaking
official
can
make
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
friedmann,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
statute
that
you
quote
in
footnote
1
on
page
8
of
your
brief,
"the
duties
of
a
prosecuting
attorney.
"
and
then
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
other
members,
the
commissioners
and
so
forth,
"may
require
written
opinions
or
instructions
from
him.
"
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
the
word
"instructions"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
manner
in
which
one
serves
a
capias
be
something
with
respect
to
which
he
could
give
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
statute,
could
the
sheriff
have
said,
what
are
my
instructions,
do
i
or
do
i
not
use
an
ax
to
break
down
the
door?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
recommendation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
because
you
called
attention
to
footnote
4
on
the
reply
brief,
and
you
indicated
that
your
brief
had
been...
portions
had
been
taken
out
of
context,
and
they
indicate,
they
quote
from
your
brief
saying
there
is
a
distinction.
they
seem
to
suggest
that
you
drew
a
distinction
between
a
policy
of
the
county
itself
on
the
one
hand
and
a
policy
of
either
the
sheriff
or
the
prosecutor
on
the
other.
do
you
maintain
that
there
is
a
difference,
that
the
county
prosecutor
or
the
county
sheriff
could
have
a
policy
for
which
the
county
would
not
be
responsible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
the
sheriff
or
the
prosecutor
or
both
collectively
had
a
policy
regarding
service
of
capiases
such
as
this.
would
you
question
that
as
being
county
policy
but
were
their
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
if
the...
or
say
if
the
sheriff,
after
consulting
with
the
prosecutor,
concluded
that
it
would
be
his
policy
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
here,
if
that
were
true,
would
that
be
county
policy
in
your
view?
