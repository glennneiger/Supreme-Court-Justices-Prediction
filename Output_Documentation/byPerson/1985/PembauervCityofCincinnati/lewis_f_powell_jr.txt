justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
proceed?
the
telephone
call
was
received
by
the
assistant
county
prosecutor.
if
there
had
been
a
policy,
why
would
he
have
gone
to
the
prosecutor
himself?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
certainly
would
have
known
if
there
had
been
a
policy.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
once?
a
single
action--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--a
single
action
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
in
response
to
a
telephone
call
relayed
to
him
by
one
of
his
assistants?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not
my
reading
or
recollection
of
owen.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
the
word
"policy"
mean?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
waylan,
assume
that
the
assistant
prosecutor
couldn't
find
the
county
prosecutor,
and
obviously
you
had
exigent
circumstances
here.
would
the
assistant
prosecutor
have
had
the
authority
to
do
what
he
did
after
he
had
talked
to
the
prosecutor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there
was
no
policy
that
would
have
guided
the
assistant
prosecutor.
