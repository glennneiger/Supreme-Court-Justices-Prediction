justice

white
you
mean
he
has
line
authority
over
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
is
certainly
authorized
to
give
them
legal
advice,
but
is
he
authorized
to
order
the
sheriff
to
go
out
and
search
a
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
quoted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
the
time
it
was
quite
constitutional
to
run
searches
this
way,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
mean
a
search
of
a
third
party
was
not
unconstitutional
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
steagald
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said...
they
announced
that
it
was
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--not
forbidden
by
clearly
established
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
was
the
correct
view
of
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
where
do
you
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
at
the
time
this
search
was
made,
at
the
time
they
knocked
the
door
down,
it
was
quite
constitutional
to
do
so
on
that
assumption.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
argue
that
because
of
owen,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
owen
wasn't
a
fourth
amendment
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
due
process
case.
and
i
didn't...
let's
assume
that
as
a
result
of
this
search
there
was
a
criminal
case
brought
against
the
doctor.
let's
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
against
the
owner
of
the
office.
was
there?
do
you
think
the
evidence
that
was
seized
would
have
been
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
there
had
been,
and
it
was
relevant
to
the
case.
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
had
happened,
it
seems
to
be
it
would
be
admissible
even
in
spite
of
steagald,
because
the
fourth
amendment
cases
like
this
are
not
retroactive.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
agree
that
new
decisions
in
fourth
amendment
law
are
not
retroactive?
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
doesn't
deter
much
if
the
municipal
authorities
thought
they
were
acting
in
accordance
with
clearly
established
law
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
attacking
the
sixth
circuit's
view.
do
you
think
that
is
essential
for
you
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter,
too.
and
yet
fourth
amendment
decisions
we
have
held
are
nonretroactive.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
your
policy
argument...
if
you
accept...
the
best
argument
for
your
policy
argument
for
a
county
policy
is
to
accept
the
sixth
circuit's
statement
that
it
was
not
contrary
to
law
at
the
time,
because
you
would
think
that
the
county
officers
would
be
carrying
out
procedures
that
the
constitution
permitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
testified
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
were
contrary
to
clearly
established
law
at
the
time,
i
think
you
would
have
a
tough
time
establishing
a
policy
from
a
single
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they
were
just
mistaken.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
the
prosecutor
has
line
authority
over
the
sheriff?
justice
byron
r.
white
footnote
8
of
the
petitioner's
brief
that
counsel
referred
to,
it
says
the
prosecutor
is
also
the
legal
advisor
for
all
county
officers.
is
that
the
extent
of
his
authority,
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
he
doesn't
have
line
authority,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
couldn't
and
didn't
set
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
defend
the
court
of
appeals
statement
that
the
prosecutor's
advice
was
consistent
with
the
existing
constitutional
law
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
is
the
case,
do
you
have
a
very...
i
suppose
the
county
or
the
state
could
have
a
policy
of
monitoring
searches
more
closely
than
the
constitution
requires,
but
surely
no
rule
of
law
forbade
this
particular
invasion
of
these
premises
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
defend
that
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you
wouldn't
defend
it
today
because
of
steagald.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
argue
or
if
not,
why
not,
do
you
argue
that
steagald
should
not
be
applied
retroactively?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
there
had
been
an
evidentiary
problem
and
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
rule
wouldn't
have
applied.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
do
you
concede
or
do
you
not
concede
that
steagald
is
retroactive
in
this
case
for
these
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
steagald,
if
you
assume
it
was
a
completely
new
rule
of
law,
would
not
be
retroactive
for
the
deterrent
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
for
1983
purposes
the
county
should
nevertheless
be
liable
even
though
at
the
time
it
was
acting
completely
consistent
with
constitutional
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
policy.
so
it
is
no
less
a
policy
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
sheriff
says
to
the
prosecutor,
should
we
break
in,
is
it
lawful
for
me
to
break
in,
the
prosecutor
says,
of
course
it
is,
that
is
what
the
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
have
never
challenged
the
applicability
of
steagald
to
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
city
have
its
own
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
did
not
object
to
it
being
held
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
didn't
come
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
accepted...
their
liability
was
finally
determined
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
of
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
individuals.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
prosecutor
would
probably
do
absolute
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
law
were
clear
but
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
under
the
existing
law
it
was
clear
as
a
bell
and
everybody
would
agree
that
under
that
law
this
particular
search
was
constitutional?
