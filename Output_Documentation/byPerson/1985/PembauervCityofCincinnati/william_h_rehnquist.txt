justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
classify
him
as
a
superior,
mr.
manley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
he
instruct
the
chief
of
police
what
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
the
city
of
cincinnati.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
county,
hamilton
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
prosecuting...
if
the
county
attorney,
if
that
is
the
term
in
hamilton
county,
wants
a
particular
item
seized
by
the
police,
he
can
tell
the
chief
of
police,
go
out
and
seize
that
item,
i
think
it
is
legal
to
do
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question
more
generally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
manley,
let
me
go
back
just
a
moment
to
the
thing
we
were
questioning
you
about
earlier.
did
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law
that
the
county
attorney
had
line
authority
over
the
sheriff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
policy
do
you
think
the
county
attorney
adopted
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he
articulated
a
longstanding
county
policy.
does
that
suggest
it
had
not
been
articulated
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
custom,
then,
if
not
a
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
this
case
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
its
mckinney
case,
which
i
gather
was
based
on
a
search
warrant
and
not
a
capias,
exonerated
waylan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
manley,
let
me
read
you
two
sentences
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
5a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
you
are
probably
familiar
with
the
opinion.
it
is
talking
about
waylan's
actions,
and
it
says,
"waylan's
actions
therefore
did
not
violate
any
clearly
established
constitutional
right.
"
"in
fact,
his
instructions
to
the
officers
accorded
with
the
law
as
it
stood
in
1977.
"
now,
that
sounds
as
though
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
your
distinction
between
capiases
and
search
warrants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
is
no
constitutional
wrong,
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
policy
or
anything
else,
because
the
action
depends
on
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation
here.
