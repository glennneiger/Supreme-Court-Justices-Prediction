mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
hamilton
county,
ohio,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
found
that
the
petitioner
had
suffered
no
constitutional
deprivation
because
of
a
policy
of
hamilton
county,
ohio.
before
proceeding
into
the
argument,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
clarify
several
points
that
were
raised
on
the
petitioner's
argument,
especially
with
regard
to
some
of
the
facts.
the
record
before
the
court
does
indicate
that
deputy
webb
testified
that
there
had
been
other
instances
where
the
third
party
premises
had
been
searched
in
effectuating
an
arrest
warrant.
however,
the
record
also
reflects
that
webb
testified
that
he
had
never
had
to
use
force
before
because
he
had
never
been
denied
entry
before.
when
he
had
the
arrest
warrant
for
someone,
the
person
who
owned
the
premises
let
him
in
the
door.
also,
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
marshall,
petitioner
indicated
that
the
police
had
talked
to
the
prosecutor
before
they
went
to
get
the
fire
ax.
that
in
fact
is
not
correct.
the
police
department,
the
cincinnati
police
department
never
did
talk
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
hamilton
county,
ohio.
it
was
a
deputy
sheriff
who
contacted
his
supervisor,
who
in
turn
connected
the
deputy
sheriff
to
the
prosecutor's
office,
and
the
deputy
sheriff
first
talked
to
an
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
who
went
in
and
talked
to
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
the
message
was
relayed
back
to
the
deputy
sheriff.
one
other
matter,
and
this
is
a
minor
matter,
but
or
page
3
in
footnote
4
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
he
indicates
that
the
respondents
have
changed
their
argument
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
were
not
arguing
that
it
was
not
a
policy
of
hamilton
county
which
caused
the
deprivation.
i
believe
that
the
statement
that
is
in
the
footnote
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
is
actually
taken
out
of
context
to
the
entire
paragraph
in
our
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
have
not
changed
our
position
in
this
matter.
petitioner
would
have
this
court--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--i
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the
statute
clearly
provides...
i
think
it
is
section
309.09
of
the
ohio
revised
code...
that
the
prosecutor
by
statute
has
the
duty
to
render
advice
to
other
county
officers
when
they
request
such
legal
advice.
that
is
his
duty
as
the
prosecuting
attorney
with
regard
to
those
other
county
officers.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
probably
are
situations
where
the
prosecuting
attorney
may
set
policy
for
certain
items
or
certain
areas.
i
don't
believe,
through,
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
prosecuting
attorney--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
as
the
prosecutor
understood
the
law
at
that
time,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
would
defend
that
view
for
his
decision--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--if
the
question
were
to
arise
today
and
i
were
the
prosecuting
attorney,
i
would
say
steagald
says
i
must
get
a
search
warrant.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
that
in
those
exclusionary
cases
and
the
search
cases
in
criminal
proceedings
the
fourth
amendment
decisions
generally
are
not
applied
retroactively.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
a
basis
of
potential
constitutional
remedy
under
42
usc
1983.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
under
the
criminal
proceedings,
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
concede
liability
on
the
part
of
the
county
in
that
position.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
constitutional
deprivation,
i
think,
in
light
of
the
steagald
decision.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
truthfully,
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
if
we
could.
your
honor,
in
this
action,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
court
impose
a
liability
upon
the
county
because
of
the
actions
it
believes
have
been
taken
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
the
petitioner
had
this
court
impose
liability
because,
and
only
because,
the
prosecuting
attorney
gave
legal
advice
to
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs,
and
as
we
have
already
said,
which
advice
was
proper
at
the
time.
after
this
court's
decision
in
oklahoma
city
versus
tuttle,
i
think
if
the
county
is
going
to
be
liable,
the
petitioner
must
show
that
there
was
an
existing
unconstitutional
policy
which
caused
a
constitutional
deprivation,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
petitioner
has
done
that
in
this
action.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
at
that
time,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
at
the
time
they
could
have
adopted
a
policy,
and
i
am
speaking
about--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--i
am
speaking
about
the
sheriff,
though,
adopting
a
policy.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
it
is
not
the
obligation
of
the
prosecutor
to
adopt
that
policy,
because
the
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
be
the
person
faced
with
the
responsibility
or
the
duty
or
the
authority
to
effectuate
that
capias
or
arrest
warrant.
that
is
not
the
prosecutor's
function.
his
function
is
to
give
advice
to
the
county
sheriff.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
on
the
part
of
the
county?
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
when
we
are
talking
about
the
time
frame
that
this
occurred,
in
1977--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--if
the
prosecutor
had
said,
my
advice
based
upon
what
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
the
united
states
versus
mckinney,
if
you
have
to
use
force
to
effectuate
an
arrest
warrant
on
the
third
person...
premises
of
some
third
person
to
effectuate
that
arrest
warrant--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--well,
your
honor,
the
courts
have
treated
this
capias
here
as
the
equivalent
of
an
arrest
warrant.
the
capias
itself
is
an
order
from
two
judges
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
saying
to
the
sheriff,
go
out
and
arrest
these
individuals
and
bring
them
before
the
court.
the
word
"arrest"
is
used
in
that
capias.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
policy
of
the
sheriff,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
actionable
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
think
in
that
situation
if
the
sheriff
makes
the
policy
decision
to
force
that
door
without
a
search
warrant
knowing
of
the
steagald
decision,
i
think
that
there
could
possibly
be
a
policy
of
the
county--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--but
that's
not
the
facts
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
but
i
think
it
is
a
big
difference.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
it
is
a
big
difference.
this
is
the
only
evidence
of
that
one
incident
where
force
ever
had
to
have
been
used,
where
a
search
ever
took
place
that
was
not
permitted,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
otherwise.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
am
not
sure
how
to
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
if
it
were
the
third
occurrence
today,
your
honor,
or
the
third
occurrence
back
in
1977?
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
if
it
occurred
today
in
light
of
steagald,
i
think
there
clearly
would
have
been
a
constitutional
deprivation.
if
it
had
been
the
third
occurrence
back
in
1977,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
would
have
been
a
policy.
it
may
have
been
a
practice.
it
may
have
been
a
custom
in
the
county
that
would
have
been
supported
by
some
evidence,
and
there
may
have
been
some
basis
to
impose
liability
on
the
county
in
that
situation,
but
those
aren't
the
facts
that
came
about
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
it
is
very
relevant,
your
honor.
if
liability
is
to
be
imposed
upon
a
custom
or
practice,
if
it
is
the
first
incident
that
is
supported
by
any
evidence,
the
only
way
that
anyone
in
any
authority
is
going
to
know
of
a
customer
practice
is
by
repeated
incidents
of
some
type
of
activity,
not
by
one
incident,
but
the
question
that
is
before
us
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
policy,
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
policy
on
the
part
of
hamilton
county.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
are
you
speaking
of
the
present
time,
your
honor,
or
again
going
back
to
1977?
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
in
light
of
steagald,
though,
and
knowing
what
steagald
says,
i
think
the
sheriff
has
some
responsibility
in
that
area
also
to
know
what
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
courts
of
ohio
have
been
as
they
relate
to
his
execution
of
arrest
warrants
or
search
warrants,
and
i
don't
believe
that
he
in
his
position
would
be
acting
as
a
reasonable
man
in
not
knowing
the
decision
in
the
steagald
case.
as
we
said
before,
i
don't
believe
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
a
policymaker
in
this
particular
case
with
regard
to
the
search
of
the
petitioner's
premises.
the
capias
was
issued
by
two
separate
judges
of
the
court
of
common
pleas.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
believe
that
there
is
provision
in
ohio
law
for
that
situation,
but
that
is
not
what
occurred
in
this
case.
the
two
employees
of
the
petitioner
had
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
they
failed
to
appear
pursuant
to
the
subpoenas
that
were
served
upon
them.
and
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
went
before
two
separate
judges
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
advising
the
court
that
these
witnesses
were
necessary
and
that
the
grand
jury
desired
them
to
be
present,
and
on
that
basis
of
that,
two
separate
judges
issued
the
capias
for
their
arrest,
to
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
it
was
before
two
separate
judges.
in
hamilton
county
there
is
a
system
whereby
every
month
the
presiding
judge
changes,
and
the
presiding
criminal
judge
is
the
judge
who
decides
whether
or
not,
if
questions
arise
with
regard
to
the
grand
jury,
what
is
going
to
happen,
and
as
it
was,
this
occurred
in
two
different
months
of
the
year,
of
the
calendar
year,
and
that
is
why
there
were
two
separate
judges
who
had
issued
the
capiases.
as
we
stated
before,
the
prosecutor
is
not
the
policymaker
in
this
area
because
he
was
required
to
give
legal
advice
to
the
sheriff,
not
directions
to
the
deputy
sheriff.
he
had
no
authority
to
control
the
activities
of
the
deputy
sheriff,
and
it
is
even
clearer
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
could
not
control
the
activities
of
the
cincinnati
city
police
department.
i
believe
that
the
rendering
of
legal
advice--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--i
did
not,
your
honor.
i
represented
hamilton
county.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
it
objected
vehemently.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
proceedings,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
with
regard
to
the
city
of
cincinnati.
why
the
city
of
cincinnati
decided
not
to
seek
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
its
liability,
i
can't
answer
for
the
city.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
the
court
of
appeals
determined--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
there
may
be
a
policy
of
the
city
which
was
responsible
for
the
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
that
purpose.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
i
think,
simply
because
that
is
the
way
that
it
was
always
characterized
in
all
documents
that
have
been
filed
since
the
initial
complaint.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
they
are
not,
your
honor,
not
before
this
court.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
they
may
be,
your
honor.
i
think,
though,
that
that
is
best
left
to
the
city
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
to
be
a
respondent
in
this
action.
again,
the
rendering
of
legal
advice
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
which
the
deputy
sheriffs
were
not
required
to
be
filed
and
which
was
in
accord
with
the
law
at
that
time
should
not
be
elevated
to
the
position
of
an
unconstitutional
official
policy
for
which
hamilton
county--
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
--i
would
view
instructions
as
legal
advice
on
how
to
handle
certain
matters
that
may
come
before
those
particular
county
officials.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
think
that
could
be
a
matter
for
which
the
sheriff
could
seek
legal
advice,
and
that
in
fact
is
what
the
sheriff's
department
did
in
this
action.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
don't
view
instructions
in
that
manner.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
as
directory
instructions.
i
think
it
would
be
considered
in
the
same
light
as
any
other
legal
advice,
that
that
is
all
it
is,
legal
advice.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
if
i
as
a
lawyer
give
advice
to
my
client,
that
client
is
certainly
free
to
disregard
that
advice,
and
i
think
clearly
the
sheriff
is
in
that
same
position
here.
he
is
not
required
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
county
prosecuting
attorney,
nor
certainly
are
his
deputies.
i
think
the
practical
result
of
adopting
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
be
that
the
prosecuting
attorneys
or
district
attorneys
or
whatever
in
local
government
units
will
be
somewhat
concerned
and
reticent
to
give
legal
advice
to
their
clients
if
the
ultimate
result
is
that
the
entity
can
be
responsible
and
liable
if
there
is
some
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
county
prosecutor
could
have
a
policy
perhaps
with
regard
to
the
operation
of
his
office
for
which
the
county
itself
does
not
recognize
him
as
the
final
repository
of
authority.
in
that
situation
he
could
have
a
policy
that
is
not
necessarily
the
policy
of
hamilton
county.
conversely,
he
could
have
a
policy
if
he
has
the
ultimate
responsibility
in
that
area
where
that
is
the
policy
of
the
county.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
if
the
prosecutor
had
it?
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
the
ultimate
decision
with
regard
to
the
execution
of
an
arrest
warrant
that
is
directed
to
the
sheriff,
i
believe,
the
ultimate
responsibility
lies
with
the
sheriff
to
effectuate
that
warrant,
and
in
that
regard,
unless
there
is
a
specific
state
statute
that
requires
him
to
do
something
else,
i
think
he
would
be
the
ultimate
policymaker
in
that
regard.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
your
honor,
i
think
in
cases
such
as
this
in
which
42
usc
1963
is
involved
the
court
should
be
seeking
to
achieve
responsible
governmental
units
where
officers
act
sensibly
and
reasonably
and
conform
their
conduct
to
existing
law
while
also
protecting
the
rights
of
individuals.
in
the
present
case
we
have
a
situation
where
all
persons
involved
in
the
local
governmental
process
acted
sensibly
and
reasonably,
with
one
exception,
and
i
think
that
is
the
petitioner.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
the
governmental
entity?
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
clearly
believe
that
the
individuals
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
and
the
courts
have
so
found
below.
mr.
roger
e.
friedmann
i
would
make
the
argument
that
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
being
in
that
position,
but
definitely
qualified
immunity
would
be
available.
again,
everyone
here
acted
sensibly
and
reasonably.
subpoenas
were
lawfully
issued
for
employees
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
only
on
the
failure
of
those
witnesses
to
appear
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
did
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
go
to
the
court
to
seek
the
capiases.
two
separate
courts
issued
the
capiases,
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
went
to
serve
those
capiases.
the
deputy
sheriffs
attempted
service
during
normal
business
hours
at
the
known
business
location
of
the
employees
who
were
named
in
the
capias.
when
thwarted,
they
sought
legal
advice,
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
gave
that
legal
advice
based
upon
the
law
of
the
time
as
he
knew
it
to
exist
within
the
sixth
circuit.
petitioner,
however,
barricaded
the
door.
it
was
only
after
the
cincinnati
police
arrived
that
the
door
was
chopped
down.
he
was
convicted
for
obstructing
official
business.
that
conviction
was
upheld,
and
this
court
denied
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
i
think
any
responsible
government
official,
even
though
he
has
immunity
in
this
situation,
is
not
going
to
be
satisfied
if
he
knows
that
some
advice,
legal
advice
that
he
has
given
might
subject
the
governmental
unit
to
liability.
for
all
the
foregoing
reasons,
i
think
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
an
unconstitutional
policy
on
the
part
of
hamilton
county
which
caused
a
constitutional
deprivation
for
the
petitioner,
and
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
