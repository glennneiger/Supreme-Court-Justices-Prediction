mr.
james
douglas
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
suspected
that
this
argument
might
involved
a
great
deal
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
in
that
sense
the
case
is
really
not
certworthy
because
you
have
a
district
court
required
to
deal
with
factors
that
were
going
to
be
announced
by
this
court
long
after
the
decision
was
rendered.
the
argument
plainly
has
not
turned
that
way.
the
argument
has
turned
on
the
question
left
open
in
blum,
and
i
would
address
that
primarily
here.
the
question
which
is
posed
is
should
a
contingency
adjustment
ever
be
appropriate
in
any
case
on
the
fee
shifting
statutes.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
six
reasons
why
it
is
obvious
that
in
some
way,
whether
in
an
adjustment
of
the
lodestar
or
in
a
multiplier,
because
the
lodestar
has
not
been
adjusted,
contingency
must
be
awarded,
must
be
a
factor
in
the
determination
of
a
fee.
the
first
answer,
of
course,
is
the
intention
of
congress,
and
congress,
when
it
did
its
most
comprehensive
study
of
the
fee
shifting
statutes,
in
dealing
with
section
1988,
went
to
some
district
court
cases
and
one
leading
court
of
appeals
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
said
this
is
the
kind
of
factor
we
are
looking
at.
they
took
johnson
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
johnson,
of
course,
turned
back
to
the
aba
standards,
and
one
of
the
factors
that
they
said
was
used
in
determining
what
is
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
was
the
contingent
nature
of
the
case,
whether
the
fee
is
fixed
or
contingency.
three
district
court
cases
were
cited,
and
at
least
in
one
of
them,
stanford
daily
v.
zurcher,
there
was
a
plain
award
of
a
multiplier
because
of
contingency.
it's
a
three
factor
problem
there,
but
contingency
is
plainly
part
of
what
the
court
cited
there,
and
at
least
in
one
of
the
other
three
cases
there
is
some
indication
that
contingency
was
involved.
so
congress
plainly
was
thinking
of
adjustment,
by
the
way,
adjustments
up
and
down,
as
this
court
has
said,
but
an
adjustment
for
contingency
was
there.
second
point
you
would
turn
to
is,
of
course,
history.
i
meant
to
take
a
little
time
this
morning
to
go
see
what
justice
sharswood's
lecture
said
back
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
absent
those
and
the
alabama
rules
of
1887,
i
can
go
no
earlier
than
1908,
but
i
presume
that
most
of
the
members
of
congress
who
adopted
the
fee
shifting
statute
had
probably,
those
who
were
lawyers,
begun
their
practice
after
1908
and
were
operating
on
the
basis
of
the
then
canons
of
professional
responsibility.
and
canon
xii
plainly
lists
among
the
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
setting
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
an
ethical
attorney's
fee,
the
contingent
nature
of
the
case.
that
wasn't
such
bad--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
both
of
those
factors
are
taken
into
account
in
the
canons.
canon
xiii
deals
with
what
we
call
in
the
tort
field
contingent
fee
cases.
that's
canon
xiii
which
talks
about
fees
which
are
set
on
contingency.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
in
canon
xii
was
plainly
the
"if
i
don't
win,
my
client
isn't
going
to
pay
me
very
well.
"
or
"my
client
may
not
have
any
money
if
i
don't
win
the
case.
"
"i'm
going
to
say
to
my
client,
either
beginning,
when
i
start
to
set
out
my
fee
discussion
or
in
a
fair
discussion
at
the
end,
i
took
a
chance
on
this,
i
got
you
something
special,
and
i
think
you
ought
to
pay
me
something
special.
"
it
could
be
a
lot
of
different
ways,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
except,
except
here...
it
also
means
whether
you
can
get
any
fee
at
all,
quite
probably.
for
instance,
if
you
are...
although
you
don't
have
a
contingent
fee
that
says
you
get
a
third
of
the
recovery,
you
know
your
client
has
no
funds
unless
you
win
the
case,
that
that
is
plainly
a
contingency.
you
only
get
a
fee,
then.
you
can
mark
it
up
because
you
took
those
chances.
and
it
is
clear
that
this
was
permissible
then,
it's
clear
it
was
permissible
under
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
method
which
was
in
existence
when
congress
acted,
it's
clear
it
still
is
the
case
under
the
model
rules,
so
that
contingency
is
one
of
the
things
you
figure
when
you
decide
how
you're
going
to
set
your
fee.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
mr.--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--mr.
chief
justice,
it's
different
from
the
traditional
contingent
fee
case
primarily
because
what
mr.
waldman
told
the
court
is
just
so
wrong.
in
the
traditional
contingent
fee
case,
i
can
make
a
fortune
if
i
win.
i
get
nothing
if
i
lose.
mr.
waldman
says
we
have
the
best
of
both
worlds,
we
have
the
worst
of
both
worlds.
if
we
win,
we
never
get
a
third
of
the
recovery
or
40
percent
of
the
recovery
or
20
percent
of
a
recovery.
if
my
client
wins,
he
gets
to
recover
a
reasonable
rate.
if
my
client
loses,
like
the
person
in
the
standard
tort
contingent
fee
case,
he
gets
nothing.
so
we
have
the
nothing
bottom
line,
just
like
the
tort
case,
and
in
that
sense
it
is
no
different
from
the
tort
case.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
we
don't
have--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--there
will
be
no
fee
recovery
in
these
cases.
whether
the
client
can
pay
something,
then
it's
the
client
who
is
bearing
the
risk,
but
i
think
congress
plainly
talked
in
terms
of
a
fee
shifting
statute,
and
in
the
case
of
most
of
these
cases,
though
we
have
not
studied
it,
i
assume
that
it
is
either
you
get
the
fee
because
you
recover
a
fee
here
or
you
don't
get
the
fee
at
all.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
there,
justice--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--there,
justice
marshall,
he
settles
for
the
fee
agreed
to
in
advance
because
he
said
i'm
going
to
waive
my
contingency,
you
pay
me,
i've
got
it,
you
aren't
contingent.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
i
don't
know
the
case
where
the
client
has
paid
it
in
advance,
so
i'm
not
sure,
but
he
certainly
doesn't
pay
anything
in
the
end
because
he's
already
made
an
agreement.
anyhow,
the
history
plainly
says
that
contingency
is
one
of
the
things
you
figure.
contrary
to
what
is
suggested,
as
i
read
the
brief
in
blum
v.
stenson...
and
i
didn't
bring
it
along...
the
government
cited
that
district
of
columbia
language
that
you
don't
expect
to
get
counsel
to
take
a
fee
where
there's
a
danger
he
won't
be
paid
at
the
same
rate
he
would
take
a
case
when
he
was
sure
of
being
paid.
i
thought
it
was
cited
as
a
statement
of
reality.
that's
how
i
read
it
in
blum.
what
i
certainly
read
and
i
do
have
present
in
the
court,
the
courtroom,
the
brief
in
shaw,
argued
a
week
ago
today,
in
which
in
footnote
8
the
government
ends
by
saving
moreover,
for
a
beginning
practitioner
or
small
firm
attorney
identified
by
respondent
as
the
typical
civil
rights
lawyer...
we're
not
so
sure
that's
true...
factors
wholly
independent
of
the
no
interest
rule
such
as
the
contingent
nature
of
the
fees
awarded
under
title
vii
and
the
likelihood
that
the
lawyer
will
have
no
steady
stream
of
income
will
have
more
effect
than
the
delay
of
interest.
so
the
government,
when
they
wrote
their
brief
in
shaw,
knew
that
contingency
mattered,
and
i
suggest
an
interest
is
plainly...
delay
in
payment
is
plainly
a
part
of
the
contingency
question,
and
i
saw
in
the
courtroom
a
week
ago
and
i
listened
to
mr.
rothfeld
tell
the
court
in
answer
to
a
question
that
if
you
weren't
dealing
with
the
government,
normally
the
way
you
would
build
a
fee
would
be
to
include
as
one
of
the
factors
in
that
fee
the
delay
in
payment.
so
the
solicitor
general
as
recently
as
a
week
ago
still
believed
that
that
part
of
contingency,
the
difference
between
whether
you
get
paid
when
you
do
the
work,
or
whether
you
get
paid
years
later,
made
a
difference.
i
don't
think
the
solicitor
general
was
wrong
in
those
cases.
i
think
he
was
talking
common
sense
that
congress
saw.
but
in
any
case,
he
ought
to
be
bound
by
his
own
beliefs.
what
else
did
congress
have?
congress
had,
or
what
else
has--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--justice
rehnquist,
i
assume
that
the
bar
that
practices
civil
rights
law
is
not
among
the
wealthy
bar
of
the
united
states
because
with
such
multipliers
as
are
given
in
those
cases
where
they
exist,
they
still
don't
come
up
to
the
kind
of
money
that
either
the
best
or
most
expensive
private
counsel
on
either
side
of
cases
make.
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
that.
but
congress
plainly
intended
enough
of
a
fee
to
permit...
to
bring
people,
competent
people,
into
these
cases.
and
i
suggest
that
this
has
not
been
lost
on
the
courts
who
have
looked
at
the
legislative
history.
at
this
point
there
are
thirteen
circuits
which
could
have
ruled
on
the
question,
thirteen
circuits
have
ruled,
and
as
i
read
and
cite
the
cases,
thirteen
circuits
have
said
contingency
is
a
factor
that
would
be
involved
in
setting
fees
in
these
cases.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
were
sure
the
court
were
ready
today
to
say
that
we
face
reality,
that
some
kind
of
a
multiplier,
either
in
setting
the
lodestar
or
in
setting...
or
in
putting
a
multiplier
to
the
lodestar,
some
account
must
be
taken
for
the
contingent
nature
of
recovery,
i
would
stop.
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
court
is
prepared
to
rule
that
way,
so
i
will
give
a
couple
more
reasons
why
i
would
and
then
turn
to
the
extent
of
the
multiplier.
the
final
historic
reason,
i
suppose,
that
you
can
say
that
congress
intended
a
multiplier
is
that
for
several
sessions
of
congress,
now,
bills
have
been
introduced
to
do
away
with
multipliers,
and
in
each
case
the
bill
has
failed
to
get
out
of
committee,
and
if
this
court's
holding
in
vasquez
v.
hillary,
just
january
of
this
year,
or
in
patsy
v.
florida
board
several
years
back
is
the
standard
you
measure
it
by,
you
have
to
say
that
the
fact
that
congress
has
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
contingency
is
a
factor
in
setting
fees,
and
congress
has
refused
to
change
it,
even
in
the
face
of
13
circuits
which
have
applied
those
multipliers,
then
that
is
an
indication
that
congress
approves
the
multiplier,
that
nobody
has
been
doing
anything
wrong
in
allowing
the
contingency
multiplier
to
exist.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
the
range
of
multipliers
that
i
am
familiar
with
in
cases...
and
this
involves
whole
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
not
as
in
this
case
certain
discrete
little
pieces
of
cases
or
pieces
of
cases,
whatever,
the
range
runs
from
4.5
down
to
1.1,
1.05,
1.2.
there
is
a
long
range
of
multipliers
that
have
been
permitted.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
the
reason
for
the
multiplier,
justice
marshall,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that's
the
only
way
you're
going
to
get
competent
counsel
to
take
these
cases,
and
that's
what
congress
intended,
and
that's
the--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--no,
justice
marshall.
the
only
way
you
can
get
counsel
to
lay
aside
the
kind
of
business
that
good
lawyers
have,
the
kind
of
lawyers
the
chief
justice
had
said
ought
to
be
practicing
in
the
federal
courts,
the
kind
of
lawyers
who
have
clients
knocking
at
their
door
and
saying
either
i
will
give
you
a
contingent
fee,
35
percent
of
the
verdict,
30
percent
of
the
verdict,
40
percent
of
the
verdict,
or
i
will
pay
you
your
hourly
rates
straight
up,
as
soon
as
you
submit
the
bill
i'm
going
to
pay,
you
want
lawyers
who
are
that
good
to
turn
down
those
cases
and
to
say
i'm
going
to
take
a
civil
rights
case.
i'm
going
to
take
it
partly
because
i
think
these
cases
matter,
because
i
think
that
the
civil
rights
acts
and
the
clean
air
acts
and
other
acts
that
congress
has
adopted
with
a
fee
shifting
provision
are
acts
that
represent
important
things--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--no.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
justice
marshall--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--i'm
getting
that
from
the
congressional
history.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
i
think--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--the
traditional
rule,
justice
marshall,
that
one
of
the
factor
that
courts
have
used
all
over
the
country
in
determining
how
you
build
a
fee
is
if
the
lodestar
rates
that
are
set
are
the
rates
you
would
set
when
you
were
sure
of
getting
paid,
then
in
order
to
bring
counsel
in,
in
order
to
compensate
them
reasonably,
you
have
to
make
an
upward
adjustment
because
they
took
the
case
on
the
chance.
that's
what
the
record--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
there
are
some
cases,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
referred
to
some
cases,
for
instance,
in
which
the
rates
that
were
built
were
rates
that
had
contingency
as
a
factor
in
them.
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
here
where
the
rates
run
from
a
high
of
$100
an
hour
to
a
low
of
$25
an
hour,
and
in
philadelphia,
mr.
waldman
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
there
aren't
partners
who
bill
at
less
than
$100
an
hour
that
i
know
about...
these--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--the
inexperienced
lawyer
who
graduated
from
law
school
in
1977...
and
you
will
remember,
justice
o'connor,
this
is
a
case
which
deals
with
engineering
problems...
had
32
years
experience
as
licensed
engineer
before
he
went
to
law
school
and
worked
in
this
case.
so
the
answer
is
in
cases
involving
technical
matters,
what
would
you
pay
a
person
who
had
been
out
of
law
school
two
years
when
the
case
began
and
seven
years
when
the
case
was
over?
i
think
$100
an
hour
would
be
the
kind
of
fee
that
you
would
collect
if
you
are
sure
you
are
getting
paid.
but
that's...
there's
no
record
made
on
this.
and
to
jump
ahead
to
where--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--i
don't
know
whether
it
takes
care
of
most
of
these
cases,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
court
had
turned
rather
than
to
the
rates
that
are
being
paid
associates
and
partners
in
philadelphia
law
firms
that
are
in
basically
the
defense
business,
the
court
had
turned
to
people
who
had
contingency
built
into
their
rates
to
look,
that
that
would
do
it.
you
don't
get
paid
double
for
contingency.
if
the
court
had
said
what
do
people
charge
when
they
realize
they
are
not
going
to
get
paid
five
years
from
the
start
of
the
case,
they
are
not
to
get
paid
anything,
and
they
said,
well,
we
have
a
batch
of
people
who
do
that,
and
these
rates
reflect
that,
that
would
be
fine.
but
the
question
here
is
that
they...
that
the
court
didn't
do
that.
i'd
like
to
touch
a
little
on
the
portion
of
the
facts
of
this
case
that
make
this
an
obvious
case
for
multipliers.
this
case
has
its
nearest
analog...
and
say
this
respectfully...
nearest
analog
in
the
massive
resistance
cases
of
thirty
years
ago.
this
is
a
case
where
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
and
eventually
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
stood
at
the
door
not
of
a
school
house
or
a
college,
but
at
the
door
of
the
emissions
testing
apparatus
and
said
you
have
won
a
verdict
from
the...
or
a
consent
decree
in
the
united
states
district
court,
a
decree
which
should
have
ended
this
litigation,
but
you
are
wrong.
like
president
jackson's
remark
to
chief
justice
marshall,
what
the
legislature
said
to
judge
bechtle
is
you
have
made
your
decision;
now
you
enforce
it.
and
what
judge
bechtle
and
delaware
valley
and
many
times
delaware
valley
against
not
only
pennsylvania
but
against
the
united
states,
and
the
solicitor
general
suggests
how
could
we
have
lost
when
we
had
the
united
states
for
our
ally?
well,
this
isn't
the
first
time
our
ally
has
stood
up
against
us.
when
there
was
a
request
for
a
substantial,
25
month
delay
in
what
had
been
agreed
to
in
the
consent
decree,
the
government
said
that's
wonderful,
and
we
had
to
go
to
judge
bechtle
against
the
federal
government
and
the
state
and
say
don't
let
this
happen,
and
eventually
we
had
delay,
but
judge
bechtle
said
you
can't
wait
until
they
invent
a
new
testing
device,
one
that
hasn't
been
invented
to
this
day,
in
order
to
start
the
program
you
agreed
to.
and
then
we
came
to
the
next
section
where
the
question
was
the
legislature
has
now
said
not
one
penny.
how
are
you
going
to
turn
the
legislature
around?
and
eventually,
working
with
the
judge
in
the
phase
where
the
extraordinary
multiplier,
or
what
is
called
an
extraordinary
multiplier,
was
described,
we
helped
develop
a
program
by
which
federal
highway
funds
were
held
up
and
the
legislature
finally
found
some
pressure.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
yes.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
justice
rehnquist,
it
didn't
result
in
putting
in
a
lot
of
time,
and
one
of
the
very
peculiar
things
here
is
that
the
judge
said
this
doesn't
take
long.
it
doesn't
take
long
at
all.
and
having
cut
us
down
to
what
i
think
are
minimal
hours,
having
watched
what
it
takes
to
write
briefs
in
this
court,
what
it
takes
to
write
briefs
in
the
third
circuit,
having
seen
those
hours
cut
down,
the
judge
says,
gee,
in
that
short
amount
of
time
you
accomplished
remarkable
results
and
against
great
risk.
and
there
were
remarkable
results
and
a
great--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
that
may
well
be
true,
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
well,
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
who
we
are
fighting
and
the
kind
of
fight
we
had,
or
my
clients
had
to
do.
the
kind
of
enemy
we
have,
maybe,
or
the
kind
of
opponent
we
have
maybe
is
best
illustrated
in
the
briefs
in
this
court.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
four
times
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
to
this
court,
they
said,
this
is
a
case
so
important
and
so
wrong
that
you
ought
to
take
the
case.
in
one
case,
it's
so
bad
that
you
ought
to
stay
the
operation
of
the
third
circuit's
order
because
that
cert
is
plainly
going
to
be
granted,
and
there's
a
great
likelihood
that
there
will
be
reversal.
we
were
told
at
that
point
that
these
issues
were
so
important
that
this
court
must
deal
with
them.
we
had
to
fight
all
of
those
issues.
and
then
when
they
get
to
this
court
and
the
court
finally
accepts
certiorari
to
deal
with
the
question
left
open
in
blum
v.
stenson,
they
say
we
could
never
have
won
this
case.
this
isn't
a
case
that
you
had
any
problems
with.
that's
the
opponent
we
have
fought
in
this,
and
that
is
the
opponent
against
whom
this
multiplier,
which
comes
to
something
under
a
nickel
apiece
for
the
6
million
people
in
pennsylvania
who
didn't
have
clean
air
for
five
years
because
of
this
resistance
to
a
consent
decree,
that's
what
it
comes
to.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
case...
and
i
think
i
will
rely
entirely
on
my
brief
on
the
question
of
the
importance
of
the
administrative
proceedings
except
to
say
that
common
sense
days
you
don't
have
regulations
required
under
a
consent
decree,
tell
counsel
don't
bother
to
go
as
over
to
the
hearings
on
the
regulations
that
are
going
to
be
adopted,
you
wait
until
the
wrong
regulations
are
adopted,
then
you
can
litigate
them
in
court,
and
with
a
lot
more
time
you
can
get
paid
for
your
work.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
common
sense
says
that
you
go
to
the...
when
you
have
won
a
decree
that
says
create
regulations,
you
go
to
the
place
where
the
regulations
are
being
made
and
make
them
part
of
the
decree.
but
i
will
go
on
past
that
and
talk
about
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
final
question
here.
the
one
thing
that
all
three
of
the
judges
in
the
court
below
were
clearly
in
agreement
on
was
that
you
can't
reverse
this
case
out
of
hand.
you
can't
simply
say
because
judge
bechtle
didn't
foresee
all
of
the
points
that
were
going
to
be
developed
in
blum
v.
stenson,
that
anywhere
he
didn't
touch
base
just
right
on
the
language
we
hold
it
against
him,
and
the
way
he
built
the
fee...
and
this
is
what
you're
doing
you're
building
a
fee,
which
is
what
a
lawyer
does
or
a
judge
acting
for
a
lawyer
in
setting
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
here,
the
way
you
build
a
fee
is
you
work--
mr.
james
douglas
crawford
--i'll
take
computing
a
fee,
but
it
makes
it
sound
more
mechanical
than
i
believe
the
setting
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
is,
justice
rehnquist,
but
to
compute
a
fee,
you
are
certainly
working
a
whole
series
of
factors
against
each
other,
and
to
suggest
that
you
can
take
the
multipliers
out
when
judge
bechtle
computed
his
entire
fee
built
on
saying
this
kind
of
result
that
deserves
a
multiplier
is
based
on
work
in
the
very
limited
number
of
hours
i
allowed,
or
my
decision
on
the
rates
is
based
on
the
fact
that
i
have...
i
can...
i
picked
noncontingent
rates
because
i
can
multiply
them
contingency
later.
judge
becker,
who
dissented
in
the
court
below,
said
what
you've
got
to
do
is
you've
got
to
send
it
down
to
judge
bechtle
and
let
him
look
into
the
question
of
whether
he's
built
contingency
into
the
rates,
whether
the
rates
are
reasonable
under
blum
v.
stenson
was
in
his
reading.
the
majority
of
the
court
said,
and
i
think
this
is
absolutely
correct,
judge
bechtle
had
the
foresight
to
anticipate
where
this
court
was
going
in
blum,
he
cited
the
right
factors,
his
discussion
is
not
three
paragraphs;
his
discussion
is
a
40
some
page
opinion,
and
the
paragraphs
bring
together
the
issues
that
were
discussed
in
that
40
some
page
decision
and
say
here's
why
i
have
the
multipliers
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
very
least,
if
this
court
does
not
affirm
or
conclude
that
apart
from
the
contingency
matter,
this
case
really
doesn't
belong
before
the
court
at
all,
that
at
the
very
least
the
matter
should
go
back
to
the
third
circuit
and
from
them
to
judge
bechtle
to
say
all
right,
here
are
all
the
rules
you
operate
with,
build
or
compute
a
fee
that
will
fairly
compensate
so
that
you
will
continue
to
get
able
lawyers
in
the
bar
doing
what
they
should
do
because,
contrary
to
what
ms.
oberly
says,
we've
had
enough
people
doing
these
cases
because
in
thirteen
circuits,
over
many
years,
there
was
the
possibility
among
other
things
of
multipliers
for
excellence
or
for
contingency.
that
should
be
continued.
thank
you.
