thank
you.
justice
stevens,
just
to
address
your
last
question,
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
lawyers
who
received
the
$<one
hundred>
[=
100]
hourly
rate
in
this
case
were
barely
put
of
law
school.
this
was
the
first
major
piece
of
litigation
they
had
ever
handled.
they...
one
graduated
in
1977,
one
graduated
in
1978,
and
by
the
time,
the
end
of
this
fee
litigation,
they
still
wouldn't
have
made
partner,
and
yet
they
were
being
compensated
at
perhaps
low
partner
rates,
but
very
high
associate
rates.

ms.
kathryn

pardon?
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
have
not
practiced
in
philadelphia,
but
i
assume
that's
standard
in
any
major
city.
the
government's
position
is,
in
this
case,
that
contingency
multipliers,
multipliers
employed
for
the
risk
of
failing
to
win
a
case,
should
never
play
a
part
in
setting
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
there
are
two
reasons
for
that
position.
the
first
is
we
think
such
multipliers
are
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
and
the
second
is
that
the
reason
that
they
are
applied
is
so
irrational
that
we
cannot
believe
that
congress
intended
courts
to
be
employing
this
sort
of
system
in
setting
what
is
supposedly
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
and
how
contingency
multiplier
subvert
that
intent,
the
court
need
only
consider
two
hypothetical
cases.
in
case
a,
the
plaintiff
loses
his
case,
and
we
know
that
he
is
entitled
to
no
fee
whatsoever.
he
did
not
prevail,
and
there
is
no
fee.
in
case
b,
the
plaintiff
wins,
and
we
know
equally
clearly
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
fully
compensatory
fee.
but
once
the
court
starts
adding
contingency
multipliers
to
case
b,
the
successful
case,
to
compensate
that
plaintiff's
lawyer
for
the
fact
that
he
lost
case
a,
the
court
is
doing
exactly
what
congress
and
this
court
has
said
is
impermissible,
compensating
for
losing
cases
or
losing
claims
in
totally
unrelated
cases.
it
is
worse
even
than
what
the
court
condemned
in
hensley.
it
isn't
even
an
unsuccessful
claim
in
the
same-case.
it
is
an--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
the
rationale
given
for
contingency
bonuses
is--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--there
are
two
given,
that
one
and
the
other
one
is
delay
in
payment
where
you
expect
to
get
paid,
but
you
don't
know
how
long
it's
going
to
take
before
you
get
paid,
and
therefore
you
will
charge
higher
than
your
hourly
rate
to
protect
yourself
against
the
time
value
of
money.
as
far
as
that
reason
is
concerned,
the
united
states--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--those
cases
are...
if
you
were
in
private
practice,
you
would
definitely
protect
yourself
against
those
cases,
and
you
would
charge
a
higher
rate
in
those
cases,
and
you
would
work
without--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--you
would
work
it
out
in
advance
with
your
client--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
your
client
was
willing,
i
think
the
canons
require
that
at
least
at
the
outset
of
the
representation
you
sit
down
with
your
client
and
explain
either
we
will
work
it
out
now,
or
if
it
is
acceptable
to
the
client,
we
will
work
it
out
at
the
end.
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
it's
an
agreement
between
two
people--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
he
could
in
the
marketplace.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
intended
to
replicate
every
element
of
the
private
practice
of
law
when
is
enacted
fee
shifting
statutes.
we
already
know
that
that's
not
the
case.
congress
imposed
a
limitation
on
these
cases
saying
we
will
only
pay
for
prevailing
cases;
we
will
only
pay
for
prevailing
claims
in
the
same
cases
if
they
are
sufficiently
distinct
that
they
can
be
severed
out,
then
you
must
sever
out--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor,
and
respondents
misquote
our
brief
in
blum,
if
that
is
what
you
are--
ms.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--what
respondents
leave
out
is
the
fact
that
that
quotation
from
our
brief
in
blum
is
the
government
quoting
a
district
court
case
explaining
the
rationale
for
contingency
multipliers.
it
is
not...
and
then,
after
setting
forth
that
quote,
we
quote
the
district
court
case,
we
then
go
on
and
say
why
it's
wrong
for
the
same
reasons
i'm
giving
you
here
today,
and
respondents
have
neglected
to
note
that
this
is
a
quote
within
a
quote.
our
position,
just
to
sum
up
on
that
point,
is
that
if
congress
wanted
to
adopt
a
system
of
paying
for
every
case,
whether
successful
or
not,
then
it
should
legislative
such
a
system.
that
is
essentially
what
the
court
held
in
ruckelshaus
v.
sierra
club.
congress
has
not
enacted
such
a
system.
in
fact,
it's
made
a
point
of
doing
the
contrary,
and
until
congress
makes
the
change
for
courts
to
compensate
losing
parties
by
cross-subs,
by
taking
extra
money
in
winning
cases
and
cross-subsidizing
losing
cases,
is
contrary
to
congressional
intent.
we
also
think
that
just
as
the
burden
of
proving
the
reasonable
number
of
hours,
the
reasonable
hourly
rate
falls
on
the
fee
applicant
under
this
court's
cases,
so,
too,
the
burden
of
proving
the
need
for
a
contingency
adjustment
should
fall
on
the
fee
applicant.
the
fee
applicant
should
be
required
to
show
that
absent
the
contingency
adjustment
there
would
not
be
sufficient
competent
counsel
to
take
the
types
of
cases
that
congress
meant
to
encourage.
the
court
need
only
scan
through
the
pages
of
the
federal
reporters
to
know
that
that
is
in
fact
not
the
case.
there
is
no
empirical
evidence
whatsoever,
and
in
fact,
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary,
that
the
current
system
of
compensation
without
multipliers
is
fully
adequate
to
attract
competent
counsel
to
take
the
cases
that
congress
intended
to
encourage
when
it
enacted
fee
shifting
statutes.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
other
rationale
for
contingency
adjustments
is
delay
in
payment
rather
than
uncertainty
about
being
paid
at
all.
for
the
united
states,
that
rationale
is
as
inconsistent
with
sovereign
immunity
as
the
argument
that
you
heard
last
week
in
library
of
congress
v.
shaw.
it
is
simply
a
disguised
interest
payment,
and
it
violates
sovereign
immunity
without
express
congressional
authorization.
we
also
agree
strongly
with
the
commonwealth
that
contingency
multipliers,
as
currently
applied,
are
so
irrational
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
them.
hensley
in
the
lodestar
approach
have,
as
the
court
noted
in
the
hensley
opinion,
the
virtue
of
objectivity,
but
once
the
court
starts
plucking
numbers
out
of
the
air,
having
made
what
is
supposedly
a
mathematically
precise
calculation
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee,
then
says
now
i
am
going
to
double
it,
i
am
going
to
multiply
it
by
1.5,
by
3.5,
by
whatever
number
strikes
the
court
in
a
clearly
subjective
sense
as
the
multiplier,
we
have
lost
all
sense
of
computing
an
objectively
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
the
doubling,
the
tripling,
whatever
the
court
does
with
these
multipliers
makes
it
impossible
for
the
court
to
justify
to
a
reviewing
court
why
it
has
picked
the
number
it
has
picked,
makes
it
impossible
for
the
defendants
who
are
saddled
with
this
extra
fee
liability
to
meaningfully
challenge
it
because
they
have
no
idea
where
the
number
came
from.
it
also
produces
counterintuitive
results
about
what
kinds
of
litigation
congress
meant
to
encourage.
as
my
colleague
pointed
out,
plaintiffs
with
the
weakest
cases
have
the
strongest
incentive
to
pursue
those
cases
because
the
court
is
likely
to
give
them
the
highest
multiplier
because
their
chances
of
success
were
least.
that
is
clearly
not
what
congress
intended.
finally,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
questions
at
the
beginning
of
my
colleague's
argument
about
what
kind
of
incantation
a
court
would
have
to
engage
in,
here
in
this
case
our
position
is
there
is
no...
it's
not
that
the
words
weren't
there,
it's
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
simply
is
no
incantation
that
would
have
justified
the
multiplier.
the
quality
multipliers,
i
am
moving
now
from
contingency
to
quality
multipliers,
were,
although
in
one
sentence
the
court
said
the
work
was
superior,
the
reason
the
court
said
the
work
was
superior
was
because,
it
said,
the
issues
ware
novel
and
complex.
those
factors
we
know
from
blum
are
subsumed
or
are
supposed
to
be
subsumed
in
the
lodestar
fee,
and
therefore,
it's
not
a
question
of
missing
words
in
this
opinion.
it's
a
question
of
the
court
counting
on
the
novelty
and
complexity,
merging
superior
quality
and
novelty
and
complexity,
and
it's
true
that
this
litigation
was
quite
protracted,
post-consent
decree,
but
what
that
did
was
force
or
enable,
however
you
want
to
view
it,
the
plaintiffs,
respondents,
to
spend
more
hours
on
the
litigation.
those
hours
that
the
district
court
found
were
reasonably
expended
were
then
compensated
at
a
fair
hourly
rate,
respondents
have
not
challenged
that
in
this
court,
and
they
have
dropped
any
challenge
to
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
hourly
rate
or
a
reasonable
number
of
hours,
and
therefore
our
quarrel
isn't
really
with
the
explanation
given
but
rather
with
the
fact
that
no
permissible
explanation
could
have
been
given
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
thank
you.
