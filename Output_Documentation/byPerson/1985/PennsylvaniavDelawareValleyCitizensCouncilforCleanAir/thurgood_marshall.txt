justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
you
tell
the
client
this
is
a
lousy
case,
you
haven't
got
a
chance
of
winning
it.
i'm
not
interested
in
a
one-third
agreement,
i
want
a
flat
fee
now,
and
he
takes
the
fee
in
advance
and
wins
a
substantial
recovery
for
the
client,
and
then
goes
to
the
client
and
says,
well,
i
want
some
extra
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
case
where
the
client
paid
him
a
nickel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what's
the
reason
for
the
multiplier?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
way
that
you
can
get
counsel
is
to
pay
counsel
more
than
he's
worth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
where
the
lawyer
has
said
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
are
you
getting
it
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
not
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
in
the
record
in
this
case
justified
the
multiplier,
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
go
back
to
those
cases
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
and
you
put
a
multiplier
of
a
thousand
times,
you
wouldn't
find
much
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
don't
see
what
it's
got
to
do
with
this
case.
