mr.
jay
c.
waldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
litigation
involves
an
award
by
the
district
court
of
substantial
legal
fee
enhancements
by
use
of
so-called
multipliers
for
three
phases
of
legal
work
during
controversies
over
implementation
of
consent
decree,
calling
for
the
institution
of
an
automobile
emission
inspection
program
in
pennsylvania
under
the
federal
clean
air
act.
the
effect
was
to
increase
these
legal
fees
by
up
to
200
percent
for
inexperienced
attorneys
already
receiving
a
high
hourly
rate.
the
result
were
hourly
rates
for
attorneys
of
up
to
$400,
or
compensation
for
the
equivalent
of
1,700
hours
of
legal
work
that
was
in
fact
never
done.
the
explanation
consisted
of
three
conclusory
paragraphs
in
a
45
page
opinion,
that
the
quality
of
representation
was
high
in
one
phase,
that
the
issues
were
novel
and
difficult
in
two
phases,
and
that
in
all
three
phases,
the
respondent
was
found
to
have
had
a
low
likelihood
of
success.
this
was
despite
the
heavy
burden
of
proof
that
petitioner
bore
in
all
phases
under
the
controlling
law
of
the
circuit,
and
this
was
after
the
court
disallowed
806
hours
requested,
including
time
for
attendance
at
press
conferences
and
interviews
as
unnecessary,
duplicative,
inadequately
documented,
and
of
dubious
significance.
the
court
also
awarded
legal
fees
for
submitting
comments
on
draft
administrative
regulations
and
attending
an
administrative
hearing.
we
contend
that
the
latter
violates
section
304(d)
of
the
clean
air
act
which
clearly
specifies
there
shall
be
compensation
for
work
done
only
in
litigation,
and
we
find
that
the
former
violates
reason,
it
is
irrational;
it
violates
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
fee
shifting
statute.
we
find...
excuse
me...
we
contend
that
it
is
violative
of
the
underpinnings
of
this
honorable
court's
holdings
in
blum
v.
stenson,
and
indeed,
we
ask
the
court
to
decide
today
the
issue
it
left
open
in
footnote
17
of
blum
as
to
whether
these
use
of
so-called
multipliers
in
cases
based
on
a
finding
that
the
prevailing
party
was
in
fact
unlikely
to
prevail
and
ran
a
high
risk
of
not
succeeding
are
ever
appropriate.
we
contend
they
are
irrational
because
they
penalize
defendants
with
the
best
defenses.
they
reward
plaintiffs
with
the
most
marginal
claims,
and
therefore
have
to
encourage
the
flooding
of
the
court
with
those
claims.
they
are
particularly
inappropriate
where
the
losing
party
bore
the
burden
of
proof.
they
result
in
irrational
and
anomalous
kinds
of
findings.
we
force
a
court
to
decide
that
it
was
likely,
in
retrospect,
that
it
would
have
decided
a
case
differently
than
it
in
fact
did,
and
one
must
ask
oneself,
if
one
wishes
to
be
rational,
how
unlikely
must
a
court
find
it
was
to
have
reached
the
result
it
did
before
one
must
question
whether
that
result
was
correct.
it
forces
the
attorney
for
the
losing
party,
in
order
to
protect
his
client
from
the
risk
of
substantial
additional
fees,
to
argue
after
the
litigation
that
in
fact
he
never
had
a
very
good
defense,
that
there
was
no
serious
likelihood
that
the
prevailing
party
would
fail.
there
are
absolutely
no
standards;
these
multipliers
are
awarded
randomly,
and
often
the
court
will
pick
a
number
out
of
the
air
that
it
deems
appropriate,
that
will
multiply
the
fee.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
yes,
it
did,
justice
burger.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
they
did
indeed.
in
a
two-to-one
opinion,
they
affirmed.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
i
would
have
to
say
no,
it
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
the
entire
explanation
that
the
court
gives
under
the
heading
of
multiplier,
which
begins
on
page
38a
of
the
appendix,
consists
of
three
conclusory
paragraphs
in
which
it
simply
states
as
a
conclusion
that
they
find
that
in
fact
there
was
a
high
quality
of
representation.
but
i
think
of
greater
importance
is
the
court's
holding
in
blum
that
absent
rare
circumstances,
quality
of
representation
and
result
achieved,
and
in
virtually
all
cases
novelty,
complexity
and
difficulty
of
the
issues
also
cited
by
the
district
court,
are
subsumed
in
the
normal
calculation
of
reasonable
hours
expended,
multiplied--
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
--well,
i
would
say
this.
i
would
say
that
before
you
can
allow
a
quality
multiplier,
based
on
this
court's
holding,
the
burden
is
on
the
fee
applicant
to
prove
in
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
court
can
cite
to
that
it
meets
the
test
of
this
court
for
the
so-called
rare
and
exceptional
test,
and
i
read
that
as
a
two-part
test.
one,
they
have
to
prove
that
the
quality
of
the
representation
is
not
adequately
reflected
in
the
calculation
this
court
held
is
presumptively
reasonable,
reasonable
hours
times
a
reasonable
hourly
fee,
and
b,
that
their
success
was
exceptional,
not
excellent,
exceptional.
and
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
no
evidence
cited
by
the
court
for
either
of
those
tests.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
well,
i
can
only
say,
justice
stevens--
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
--well,
i
would
say
two
things.
i
would
say
that
this
court
in
the
hensley
case
made
the
distinction
between
excellent
and
exceptional,
and
i
must
conclude
that
by
exceptional,
the
court
certainly
meant
some
kind
of
success
that
was
beyond
excellent,
and
i
would
say
extraordinary.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
it...
yes,
it
is,
although
i
would
say
certainly
if
it
can
ever
be
weighed,
it
should
be
weighed
and
considered
under
a
test
no
less
stringent
than
the
test
that
this
honorable
court
set
forth
in
blum
for
quality
and
result.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
this
to
you.
the
aba...
and
i
think
it
is
the
sixth
factor...
i
am
trying
to
remember.
i
can't
remember
the
number.
it's
in
their
code
of
professional
responsibility...
when
the
<aba>
[=
aba]
said
you
may
consider
contingency,
i
really
submit
to
you
that
they
never
contemplated
by
that
that
a
lawyer,
after
he
totalled
up
his
fee
based
on
reasonable
hours,
should
then
multiply
it
by
a
number
picked
out
of
the
air
and
send
a
bill
for
that
amount
to
his
client.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
it
is
in
my
opinion,
justice
stevens,
because
unlike
the
hypothetical
that
you
give
where
a
private
party
is
free
to
enter
into
any
agreement
with
a
private
attorney
to
file
the
riskiest,
most
dubious
litigation,
we
are
here
dealing
with
cases
where
congress
only
intended
that
meritorious
cases
be
brought.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
the
answer
is
no
and
yes.
i
do
not
think
it's
unethical.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
but
i
think
that
where
congress--
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
--i
think
where
congress,
however,
says
a,
we
are
only
going
to
compensate
successful
claims,
and
we
are
not
going
to
subsidize
directly
or
indirectly
unsuccessful
claims,
and
where
it
says
we
are
interested
in
attracting
meritorious
cases,
then
one
must
ask
what
in
the
marketplace
would
be
reasonably
necessary
to
induce
an
attorney
to
take
a
meritorious
claim?
and
i
submit
that
if
a
meritorious
claim
is
anything,
it
is
a
claim
that
when
properly
analyzed
offers
at
least
some
reasonable
likelihood
of
success
with
proper
presentation
and
preparation
by
a
competent
attorney
putting
in
the
hours.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
yes,
and
i
believe
it's
precisely,
justice
stevens,
what
congress
did
not
intend,
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
that
in
hensley,
among
other
cases,
in
the
fee
shifting
statute
because
it
specified
for
compensation
only
for
successful
claims.
in
fact,
this
honorable
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
it,
that
the
district
courts
must
scrutinize
records
to
make
certain
that
they
are
not
compensating
an
attorney
for
work
done
on
unsuccessful
portions
of
a
case
or
unsuccessful
claims
in
the
same
litigation,
let
alone
help
subsidize
him
for
losing
work
done
in
unrelated
cases,
for
unrelated
parties.
mr.
waldman,
do
you
think
that
in
determining
the
prevailing
market
rate,
that
there
is
a
different
rate
generally
in
the
community
for...
that
lawyers
for
plaintiffs
charge
when
there
are
these
uncertainty
factors,
and
the
rate
charged
by
the
typical
defense
bar,
and
does
the
court
maybe
look
to
a
specialized
market
within
the
plaintiffs'
bar
for
determining
the
prevailing
market
rate?
in
a
case
involving
damages
as
well
as
equitable
relief,
i
would
say
quite
possibly
yes,
justice
o'connor,
but
think
about
what's
really
happening
here.
what's
happening
here
is
we
are
compensating
these
lawyers
as
if
they
were
getting
a
fixed
fee,
fixed
hourly
fee
typical
of
the
defense
bar,
plus
a
contingency
or
percentage
typical
of
the
plaintiffs'
bar.
we
are
giving
them
both.
first,
we
multiplying
the
reasonable
hours
times
a
reasonable
hourly
rate,
and
on
top
of
that,
we
are
picking
a
number
out
of
the
air
and
multiplying
that,
resulting
in
still
a
greater
amount
of
relief.
in
effect,
we
have
created
a
small
class
of
attorneys
here
who
are
getting
compensated
as
if
they
were
both
plaintiffs
and
defense
lawyers
in
the
same
case.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
i
would
say,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
court
in
blum
set
out
what
is...
what
i
would
submit
is
a
proper
test.
where
the
quality
is
high,
where
the
results
are
excellent
or
outstanding,
then
certainly
one
would
assume
this
reflects
both
the
skill
of
the
attorney
and
the
hours
and
dedication
he
put
in,
and
these
absolutely
can
and
should
be
reflected.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
in
a
higher
hourly
rate.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
we
would
not
object
to
that,
and
for
one
thing,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
--no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
in
fact,
your
approach
would
result
in
an
objective,
measurable
standard
that
one
could
at
least
discuss
and
analyze
and
review.
the
standard
that
is
being
used
in
awarding
a
massive
multiplier
based
on
likelihood
that
the
prevailing
party
would
fail
is
something
like
going
to
las
vegas.
i
mean,
they
pick
a
number
out
of
the
air,
it
is
not
explained,
and
the
fee
is
multiplied,
resulting
in
this
case,
for
example,
of
a
fee
that
is
over
125
percent
higher
than
the
fee
you
would
get
if
you
simply
awarded
hours
times
a
high
hourly
rate.
the
court
specifically
found
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
use
a
high
hourly
rate,
and
it's
a
rate
approximately
$100
an
hour
for
lead
counsel,
that
this
honorable,
court
recognized
in
blum
as
a
high
rate.
so
they
already
were
getting
a
high
rate,
multiplied
by
every
hour
that
the
court
found
to
be
sustainable.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
four
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
well,
the
court
found
it
was,
and
this
honorable
court
found
it
was
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
blum
case.
it
found
$105,
in
the
case
of
new
york
city,
was
a
high
rate.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
i
would
say
in
some
cases
yes,
in
some
cases
no.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
in
this
case
this
particular
party's
lawyer
received
an
average
of
$210
an
hour
for
all
the
legal
work
done
in
all
phases,
even
the
ones
where
no
multiplier
was
used.
i
submit
this
is
more
than
adequate
to
attract
competent
counsel
in
the
future
to
represent
comparable
parties
with
comparable
claims,
and
particularly
under
a
scheme
where
congress
intended
only
meritorious
cases
be
brought.
another
point
that
i
would
make
is
that--
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
--i
would
say
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
had
very
good
arguments
on
the
facts,
but
what
made
the
case
very,
very
difficult
was
in
fact
that
we
bore
a
heavy
burden
of
proof.
mr.
jay
c.
waldman
well,
we
didn't,
but
the
commonwealth
did,
and
a
new
administration
taking
a
new
view
for
three
years
attempted
to
amend
it,
not
resist
it.
but
in
any
event,
we
bore
a
strong
burden
of
proof
in
all
phases.
we
had
the
award
here
of
a
multiplier
of
four,
one
of
the
highest
multipliers
ever
used,
for
an
attorney
a
year
out
of
law
school.
and
were
not
paying
an
engineering
fee,
we
were
paying
a
legal
fee.
also,
i
think
very
importantly,
my
opponent
confuses
the
contingent
nature
of
litigation
with
a
continent
fee.
all
the
case
that
he
refers
to
indicated
was
that
where
in
fact
there
is
a
contingent
fee
agreement,
a
contract,
the
court
should
look
to
that
contract
as
a
guideline
for
what
fee
it
in
fact
allows,
and
under
no
circumstances
should
it
exceed
that
fee.
but
the
courts
have
held
where
there
is
no
contract
for
a
fixed
fee
or
a
contingency,
it
awards
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
and
this
honorable
court
has
held
that
a
fee
is
presumptively
reasonable
under
a
fee
shifting
statute
if
it
multiplies
the
reasonable
number
of
hours
expended
times
a
reasonable
hourly
rate.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
we
had
a
high
hourly
rate
and
a
substantial
number
of
hours,
and
i
would
submit
that
certainly
the
fee
is
reasonable
and
should,
i
would
argue,
be
sufficient
to
compensate
any
lawyer
in
the
future
who
was
asked
to
undertake
comparable
kind
of
case.
i
would
make
one
last
point.
thirteen
circuit
courts
may
have
ruled
the
way
my
opponent
indicates,
but
in
fact,
only
three
circuit
courts
have
even
addressed
this
issue
since
blum
was
decided.
and
two
of
them,
the
seventh
and
the
district
of
columbia,
do
not
agree
with
my
opponent's
position.
in
fact,
they
raise
most
of
the
objection
we
have
raised
here
today
to
the
use
of
contingency
multipliers.
one
went
the
other
way,
the
first
circuit.
thank
you.
