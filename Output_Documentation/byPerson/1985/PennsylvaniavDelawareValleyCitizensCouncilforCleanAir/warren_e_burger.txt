mr.
waldman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.

mr.
crawford?
chief

e.

--for
me,
mr.
crawford--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--it
confuses
this
issue
markedly
to
talk
about
this
as
a
contingent
fee
case.
a
contingent
fee
case
is
one
where
in
advance,
the
typical
tort
negligence
case,
33
1/3
or
40
percent
as
is
being
charged,
that
is
a
contingency
fee
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hold
on.
let
me
finish.
so
it
confuses
this
issue
when
you
take
this
other
and
draw
it
in.
now,
what
these
standards
mean
is
that
when
there
is
a
success
the
hourly
rate
is
one
factor,
and
that
the
result
is
taken
into
account,
and
that
is
quite
different
from
the
traditional
contingent
fee
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you're--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--you
are
assuring
the
client
in
advance
that
you
will
not
charge
him
anything
if
you
don't
recover?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
crawford,
isn't
the
question...
put
it
this
way.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
result
may
be
taken
into
account,
but
to
what
extent
it
may
be
taken
into
account,
the
multiplier.
really,
most
of
this
argument
evades
or
avoids
at
least
that
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
range
of
multipliers
that
they
have
used
in
the
13
circuits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
welcome.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
waldman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
