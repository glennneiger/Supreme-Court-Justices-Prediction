justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
waldman,
the
district
court
allowed,
as
i
understand
it,
two
sorts
of
multipliers
or
increases.
one
was
a
so-called
quality
of
representation
multiplier
or
increase,
and
although
the
court
acted
before
our
opinion
in
blum
v.
stenson,
it
did
appear
to
set
forth
as
its
reasons
some
of
the
reasons
spelled
out
in
blum
v.
stenson
that
might
justify
such
an
increase,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
should
the
court
have
said
in
terms
of
any
incantations
before
its
quality
of
representation
multiplier
should
be
allowed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
there
be
a
higher
hourly
rate
in
the
first
place
for
a
plaintiff's
compensation
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
could
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
higher
hourly
rate
and
compensation
for
all
the
hours
spent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
wasn't
done
here,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
crawford--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
what
extent
are
the
courts
around
the
country,
in
setting
the
hourly
rate,
looking
not
at
what
a
defense
lawyer
might
get
per
hour
but
looking
at
what
a
lawyer
might
get
who
had
to
take
some
risk
in
the
payment
factor,
in
other
words,
a
higher
hourly
rate,
in
short.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
work
here
was
done
by
very
inexperienced
lawyers
who
would
be
likely
to
charge
$100
an
hour?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
to
the
extent
that
courts
can
and
do
look
at
what
you
call
a
contingency
factor
in
setting
the
hourly
rate,
is
that
not
satisfactory,
and
doesn't
that
take
care
of
most
of
these
cases?
