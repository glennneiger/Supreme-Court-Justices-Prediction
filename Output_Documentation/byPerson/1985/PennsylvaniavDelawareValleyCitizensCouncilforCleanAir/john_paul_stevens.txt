justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
success
being
exceptional?
is
it
more
than
a
reasonable
attorney
would
have
expected
to
achieve?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
so,
how
is
that
different
from
contingency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
not
quite
clear.
is
it
your
position
that
the
contingency
factor,
the
probability
of
success
in
the
case
must
he
totally
disregarded
and
can
never
be
weighed
by
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
view
that
lawyers
never
take
into
account
contingency
in
fixing
the
fees
at
the
end
of...
i
think
the
aba
standard
suggests
contingency
as
one
of
the
many
factors
to
look
at.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
agree,
the
multiplier
may
be
a
little
different
concept,
but
i
am
just
wondering
whether,
you
know,
maybe
a
15
percent
bonus
because
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
odds
of
prevailing
were
very
long,
is
it
your
view
that
is
totally
impermissible
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
apart
from
an
agreement
in
advance,
sometimes
lawyers
take
a
case,
i
know
i
did
often,
and
they
say,
well,
when
we
are
all
done
i
will
figure
out
what's
fair,
and
we'll
talk
about
it,
and
at
the
end
of
the
work
i
think
back
and
i
think,
well,
it
was
kind
of
a
difficult
case
and
we
had
a
much
better
result
than
we
expected,
and
the
odds
were
rather
long,
and
i
think
maybe
we
are
entitled
to
be
paid
a
little
extra
for
that
reason.
you
would
say
that
would...
first
of
all,
would
you
say
that
was
unethical
to
approach
fees
in
that
way,
and
secondly,
you
say
it
is
prohibited
by
the
statute
in
this
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
a
lot
of
us
used
to
work
that
way.
that's
why
i
am
puzzled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doesn't
the
competent
attorney
always
figure
that
some
of
his
more
profitable
cases
are
going
to
help
him
with
some
of
his
losers?
i
mean,
isn't
that
part
of
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
$100
an
hour
a
high
rate
in
philadelphia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
more
than
most
partners
get
in
philadelphia,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
takes
seven
or
eight
years
to
make
partner
in
philadelphia,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
takes
seven
or
eight
years
to
make
partner
in
philadelphia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
why
do
you
assume
it
is
compensation
for
the
other
case?
supposing
a
lawyer
won
every
case
he
ever
tried
and
he
had
one
that
was
a
particularly
long
shot
and
he
said
i
think
i
will
charge
a
little
extra
because
of
the
contingency
factor,
would
you...
well,
he
wouldn't
be
charging
for
some
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
necessary?
is
that
the
only
possible
rationale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
simply
the
reason
you
are
uncertain
whether
you
will
get
paid
or
not,
even
though
you
won
all
your
other
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
might
not
do
that
pursuant
to
an
advance
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
have
to
work
it
out
in
advance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
work
it
but
later,
and
at
that
time
we
will
agree
on
what
appears
to
both
of
us
to
be
a
fair
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
listen
to
my
question
for
a
moment.
supposing
the
agreement
was
we
will
fix
the
fee
when
the
litigation
is
over,
we
will
do
something
that's
fair
to
both
of
us.
you
get
all
over,
all
done,
could
the
lawyer
then
at
that
time
say
simply
because
i
was
doubtful
about
whether
i
would
get
paid
at
all,
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
a
premium,
5
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
government,
has
the
government
changed
the
position
it
took
in
its
brief
in
blum
v.
stenson
that
they
took--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
did
they--
