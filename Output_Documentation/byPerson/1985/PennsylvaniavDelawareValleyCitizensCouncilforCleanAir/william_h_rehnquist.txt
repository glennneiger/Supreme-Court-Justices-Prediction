justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
waldman,
the
district
court,
as
i
recall,
acted
before
our
opinion
in
blum
v.
stenson
came
down,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
its
opinion
after
that
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
that
means,
mr.
crawford?
does
it
mean
the
fact
that
you
have
an
agreement
with
the
client
that
you
will
be
paid
only
in
the
event
of
success,
or
does
it
mean
your
agreement
with
the
client
may
be
somewhat
indefinite
or
the
client's
means
somewhat
suspect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
means
very
little
more
than
if
you
win
a
case
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
better
fee
for
it
than
if
you
lose
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
saying,
mr.
crawford,
may
have
a
great
deal
of
applicability
to
the
fixing
by
a
client
of
a
private
attorney,
but
i
think
one
of
your
opponent's
arguments
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
fee
shifting
bar,
if
you
will,
to
make
a
good
living
at
this
business.
they
were
to
make
a
fair
fee
off
the
cases
they
won,
but
they
weren't
to
be
able
to
pick
up
for
the
cases
they
lost
in
the
same
way
that
a
private
attorney
could.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
crawford--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
can
see
why
all
of
this
would
result
in
the
attorneys
putting
in
a
great
deal
amount
of
time
on
the
case,
but
you
got
paid
for
all
the
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
it
sounds
better
to
say
computing
a
fee
rather
than
building
a
fee?
