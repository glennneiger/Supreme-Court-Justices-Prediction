justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
weber,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
first
branch
of
your
argument
for
a
minute,
if
i
might.
justice
rehnquist
brought
out
with
your
opponent
that
the
statutory
language
isn't
"must";
it's
"need
not
entertain".
is
it
your
view
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
discretion
either
to
entertain
or
not
entertain,
or
that
he
had
an
absolute
obligation
to
entertain
the
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
put
a
second
question
that's
related--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
then
you
might
want
to
cover
them
both.
if
one
takes
the
view
that
the
district
court
had
discretion,
what
is
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals?
is
it
to
decide
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
or
whether
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
thought
the
ends
of
justice
were
served
and
made
the
initial
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
they
didn't
really
do
that.
they
just
in
effect,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
just
said,
we
think
the
ends
of
justice
will
be
served.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
didn't
really
say
whether
the
district
court
was
plainly
wrong
in
coming
to
a
contrary
conclusion
or
whether
the
district
court
had
a
duty
simply
to
entertain
the
petition.
i'm
a
little
unclear
as
to
exactly
what
the
procedural
posture
you
think...
what
you
think
the
correct
procedural
rulings
were.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
denied
it
without
a
hearing,
did
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
district
court
denied
it
on
the
merits,
rather
than
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
successive
petition
raising
the
same
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
your
time's
up
and
i
just
didn't
get
a
chance.
on
the
first
point,
in
the
district
court
on
the
second
habeas
petition,
did
you
argue
in
the
district
court
that
the
district
court
should
not
entertain
the
petition
because
the
same
issue
had
been
raised
in
a
prior
habeas
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
