mr.
philip
s.
weber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
this
case
show
a
glaring
violation
of
wilson's
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
he
was
placed
in
a
holding
cell
with
a
secret
informant
after
his
right
to
counsel
had
attached.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
we
haven't
argued
that
that
is
a
clearly
erroneous
finding.
what
we
believe
is
that
the
state
court
found
a
mixed
conclusion
of
law
and
fact
that
the
statements
were
voluntary
and
unsolicited
and
spontaneous,
and
that
the
federal
court
on
a
habeas
petition
could
re-examine
that
finding.
but
what's
more
important,
perhaps,
is
that
a
finding
of
spontaneity
or
voluntariness
of
unsolicitedness
perhaps,
if
you
will,
does
not
answer
the
inquiry
that
henry
requires
of
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus.
what's
required
of
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
in
this
context
is
that
the
court
ask
whether
the
statement
was
deliberately
elicited
from
the
accused
in
the
absence
of
his
counsel
by
the
conduct
of
the
state,
in
which
the
state
created
a
situation
that
is
likely
to
induce
the
accused
to
make
his
statement
to
the
informant.
here
that
was
exactly
what
was
done,
and
these
facts
are
legally
indistinguishable
from
those
of
united
states
against
henry.
in
henry,
as
in
the
present
case,
the
state
deliberately
elicited
the
statement.
under
henry
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
questions
were
asked
by
the
informant
or
whether
the
informant
interrogated
wilson.
that
has
all
gone
by
the
boards
and
it
is
now
clear,
although
it
was
not
after
brewer,
that
interrogation
or
questioning
is
not
an
essential
element
of
a
violation
of
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment.
accordingly,
if
wilson's
case
were
tried
in
1985
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
testimony
would
not
be
admissible
at
trial.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed
because,
in
the
light
of
henry,
that
evidence
was
erroneously
admitted
in
1970
at
wilson's
trial.
my
argument
today
will
consist
of
two
points:
first,
it
was
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
to
entertain
wilson's
current
petition
in
light
of
united
states
against
henry,
which
was
an
intervening
authority
with
direct
and
substantial
bearing
on
wilson's
constitutional
claim.
second,
in
correctly
entertaining
wilson's
current
application,
the
court
below
complied
with
section
2254(d)
by
giving
due
regard
to
the
finding
of
fact
that
the
state
trial
court
made
when
it
determined
wilson's
motion
to
suppress
lee's
testimony.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
the
court--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--there
has
been
no
change
in
the
facts,
your
honor.
the
same
facts
that
were
presented
on
the
first
petition
were
presented
on
the
second
petition.
to
the
extent
that
whenever
the
accused
is
denied
the
right
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
his
innocence
is
called
into
question,
that
issue
is
present
here.
the
court--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--your
honor,
what
i
would
argue
is
probably
not
pertinent
here.
but
what
would
be
argued
at
the
new
trial
is
that
he
is
innocent
and
that
the
evidence,
absent
lee's
testimony,
does
not
sustain
a
conviction.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
well,
that
is
something
that
would
have
to
remain
for
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
no,
it
hasn't,
your
honor.
with
regard
to
the
first
point,
section
2244(b)
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
the
federal
courts
to
foreclose
wilson's
habeas
corpus
petition,
because
the
statute
is
purely
permissive,
and,
second,
because
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
court
below
correctly
exercised
its
discretion
to
entertain
the
petition.
as
to
the
permissive
nature
of
section
2244(b),
it
only
authorizes
a
federal
court
to
decline
to
entertain
a
successive
habeas
corpus
petition
it
it
so
chooses.
the
statute
does
not
command
the
court
to
dismiss
the
petition
under
any
circumstances.
under
section
2244(b),
the
court
may
refuse
to
entertain
a
successive
petition
in
two
situations.
first,
it
may
refuse
to
entertain
the
petition
if
it
is
persuaded
that
there
is
no
new
grounds.
second,
if
a
new
ground
is
asserted,
it
may
dismiss
the
petition
if
the
prisoner
deliberately
withheld
the
new
ground
or
otherwise
abused
the
writ.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1966
amendments,
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
argument,
shows
no
intention
of
congress
to
overturn
the
rule
of
guidance
that
this
court
announced
in
1963
in
sanders.
by
enacting
two
new
subsections
governing
state
prisoners,
congress
legislated
two
bases
on
which
a
federal
court
might
decline
to
entertain
a
successive
petition
from
a
state
prisoner.
these
sections
do
not
prevent
the
court
from
determining,
in
accordance
with
the
rule
of
sanders
and
the
universal
practice
of
the
federal
courts
since
sanders,
whether
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
by
its
entertaining
the
successive
petition.
that
decision
of
whether
to
entertain
a
successive
petition
that
was
previously
decided
on
the
merits
on
the
same
ground
below
rest
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
federal
courts
in
two
respects.
first,
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
decide
whether
to
exercise
its
prerogative
to
decline
to
entertain
the
successive
petition,
giving
as
its
reason
that
the
petition
was
already
decided
once
before
on
the
same
grounds
on
the
merits
below.
this
is
inherent
in
the
use
of
the
word
2244(b).
mr.
philip
s.
weber
well,
i
think
that
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
sanders,
your
honor.
there
the
court
said
that
the
ends
of
justice
could
not
be
too
finely
particularized
because--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--yes
indeed.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
i
do
argue
that
it's
binding,
for
two
reasons
perhaps.
one
is
that
sanders,
even
though
it
was
a
federal
case,
said
that
it
was
deciding
the
matter
also
with
respect
to
state
cases.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
well,
in
a
sense
the
rule
of
guidance
is
dictum,
because
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
holding
of
the
case.
so
in
a
strict
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
put
in
the
sense
that
it's
the
central
teaching
of
the
case,
i
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
overrule
the
case
in
order
to
adopt
the
petitioner's
rule.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
yes,
your
honor.
the
sanders
court
purposely
left
the
ends
of
justice
standard
loosely
defined.
what
the
court
left
quite
clear
is
that,
even
if
the
same
around
was
previously
determined
on
the
merits,
it
is
open
to
the
prisoner
to
show
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
by
a
redetermination
of
the
same
ground.
the
ends
of
justice
language
in
sanders
and
in
the
old
section
2244
never
served
as
a
means
by
which
the
federal
court
could
entertain
a
petition
which
it
was
not
otherwise
entitled
to
review.
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
argument,
the
ends
of
justice
language
in
sanders
did
not
provide
a
loophole
for
the
courts
to
use
to
entertain
petitions
that
otherwise
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain.
indeed,
section
2254(a)
of
title
28
provides
that
the
court
shall
entertain
an
application
of
a
prisoner
who
alleges
that
his
confinement
is
unconstitutional.
needless
to
say,
that
is
entrusted
with
many
exceptions,
which
are
not
applicable
here.
section
2244(b)
provides
a
certain
permissive
exception
to
this,
to
this
commandment
that
the
court
shall
entertain
the
petition.
in
certain
cases
the
court
need
not
entertain
the
petition.
but
nowhere
does
section
2244(b)
or
any
other
statute
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
case
say
that
the
court
shall
not
entertain
the
petition.
this
court
should
now
reject
the
state's
argument
that
dismissal
should
be
mandatory
because,
as
the
court
recognized
in
sanders,
the
considerations
governing
each
case
must
be
weighed
individually.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
to
entertain
wilson's
current
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
below
did
not
depend
upon
a
finding
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
by
deciding
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
simply
foreclosed
the
option
of
not
entertaining
the
petition.
sanders
holds
that
if
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
then
the
court
must
entertain
the
petition.
one
of
the
specific
instances
in
which
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served,
according
to
sanders,
is
the
case
where
there
is
an
intervening
change
in
the
law.
the
court
below
correctly
perceived
that
henry
is
a
directly
applicable
case
with
a
direct
and
substantial
bearing
on
the
case
before
the
court
today.
this
is
because
henry
developed
and
clarified
the
law
which
is
applicable
to
this
case
and,
even
as
the
petitioner
concedes,
lends
some
support
to
wilson's
claim
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
i
think
in
that
case,
your
honor,
what
we
would
have
is
a
case
that
makes
clear
that
the
prior
legal
determination
of
the
courts
that
considered
the
first
petition
was
a
plain
error,
and
that
is
the
contention
that
the
petitioner
alluded
to
in
his
argument
and
we
think
that
that
is
within
the
purview
of
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
reconsider
that.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
at
common
law
there
was
no
limit
to
the
number
of
times
a
prisoner
could
bring
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
congress
has
not
acted
to
limit
that,
and
indeed--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
believes
that
there
should
be
some
limit,
but
it
has
not
made
a
limit
as
to
this
particular
point.
it
has
limited
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
bring
successive
petitions
in
the
case
of
abuse,
for
example,
which
is
2244(b),
or
for
example
in
a
case
where
this
court
has
previously
determined
the
issue
at
the
bar.
those
were
the
innovations
of
the
amendments
of
1966.
the
amendments
of
1966
do
not
refer
to
the
ends
of
justice.
i
don't
think
that
when
congress
enacted
those
subsections
that
it
intended
to
foreclose
the
ability
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
consider
the
ends
of
justice
when
deciding
whether
a
successive
petition
deserved
to
be
reviewed.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
the
ends
of
justice
may
well
indicate
and
often
probably
does
indicate
that
a
petition
should
not
be
reviewed.
i
think
that
in
the
case
of
a
petition
that
raises
no
new
ground,
that
perhaps
is
the
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
petition
on
the
same
basis,
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
petition
should
not
be
reviewed.
that's
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
this
petition
does
contain
a
new
element.
it's
not
a
new
ground
within
the
meaning
of
sanders,
because
sanders
defined
the
ground
to
mean
the
sufficient
legal
basis
on
which
the
petition
is
brought,
so
that
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
sixth
amendment
for
a
violation
of
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
is
a
ground,
and
therefore
most
likely
this
petition
does
not
assert
a
new
ground,
although
in
sanders
the
court
said
that
when
there
is
a
question
about
that
is
should
be
interpreted
favorably
to
the
applicant.
but
coming
back
to
the
main
thought,
here
we
have
something
new
under
the
sun.
there
is
a
case,
an
intervening
authority
with
a
direct
and
substantial
bearing
on
wilson's
claim.
it
lends
support
to
his
claim,
and
all
that
wilson
is
asking
for
is
for
an
opportunity
to
present
that
claim
to
the
court.
by
entertaining
the
petition,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
petition
will
be
favorably
decided
for
the
petitioner.
it
means
that
the
court
will
consider
the
claim.
it
means
that
it
will
not
be
summarily
dismissed.
it
means
that
the
petitioner
will
have
a
hearing
before
the
court.
that
is
all
that
the
ends
of
justice
requires.
if
the
federal
courts
refuse
today
to
hear
wilson's
petition
merely
because
he
had
previously
attempted
to
obtain
relief,
it
would
be
to
penalize
him
for
asserting
his
right
too
soon.
today
we
have
the
benefit
of
a
new
precedent
with
a
direct
and
substantial
bearing
on
his
constitutional
claim.
the
federal
courts
that
considered
wilson's
first
petition
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
henry,
and
neither
did
the
state
court
that
originally
determined
his
claim.
the
federal
courts
that
considered
his
petition
the
first
time
assumed
that
the
state
of
the
law
was
such
that
interrogation
or
behavior
tantamount
to
interrogation
was
necessary
in
order
to
find
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it
would
be
unjust
to
refuse
to
re-examine
wilson's
claim
today
as
it
stood
before
henry,
when
henry
lends
this
support,
as
even
the
petitioner
agrees,
to
wilson's
claim
of
unconstitutional
confinement.
i
should
now
like
to
turn
to
my
second
argument,
which
is
that
the
court
below
treated
the
state
trial
court's
finding
of
fact
with
due
deference
under
section
2254(d).
in
the
course
of
entertaining
wilson's
current
petition,
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
state
court's
finding
that
the
informant
did
not
interrogate
wilson.
this
was
the
finding
of
fact
that
the
state
trial
court
relied
on
when
it
determined
wilson's
motion
to
suppress
lee's
testimony.
this
is
evident
from
the
finding
of
the
state
court
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
which
the
statute
specifically
requires
that
the
federal
habeas
court
defer
to.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
written
finding
in
the
record
and
not
the
full
record
which
comprises
the
facts
that
the
state
trial
court
found
and
to
which
deference
is
deserved.
the
state
court
amply
discussed
the
basis
for
its
holding
in
its
decision.
section
2254(d)
makes
it
clear
that
deference
is
due
to
these
findings
of
fact,
and
the
findings
of
fact
here
and
the
ones
that
the
state
court
considered
determinative
were
the
findings
of
no
interrogation.
the
court
below
accepted
this
finding
and
so
it
did
not
violate
section
2254(d),
even
though
it
did
reach
the
opposite
legal
conclusion
from
the
state
court.
the
state
urges
this
court
to
engage
in
speculation
concerning
the
cause
of
wilson's
inculpatory
statement.
it
asks
this
court
to
suppose
that
wilson's
statement
was
caused
by
a
visit
from
his
brother.
in
doing
so,
the
state
goes
beyond
the
record
to
which
deference
is
due
for
its
facts,
because
the
state
court
never
mentioned
the
visit
from
wilson's
brother
even
once
in
the
course
of
its
decision.
but
more
importantly,
this
argument
of
the
state
shows
a
misunderstanding
of
the
henry
decision.
this
court
held
in
henry
that
the
correct
inquiry
is
whether
the
state
deliberately
elicited
a
confession
by
creating
a
situation
that
was
likely
to
induce
the
accused
to
speak
to
the
informant.
this
is
not
a
subjective
inquiry
and
it
does
not
require
an
inquiry
into
the
state
of
mind
of
the
prisoner.
if
in
fact
the
state
deliberately
set
out
to
elicit
a
damaging
statement
from
the
accused
by
using
a
stratagem
that
was
likely
to
succeed
and
did
obtain
such
a
statement,
then
the
henry
test
has
been
satisfied
and
the
right
to
counsel
has
been
violated.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
s.
weber
absolutely.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
no,
there
isn't
a
finding
of
that
in
the
state
court's
decision,
because
the
state
court
didn't
know
that
that
was
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
investigating.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
well,
the
court
of
appeals
below
correctly
determined--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--the
district
court
held
that
the
visit
from
wilson's
brother
was
in
fact
the
cause.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
your
honor,
that
the
purpose
of
the
state's
employing
an
informant--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--was
to
elicit
a
statement
from
the
accused.
now,
the
petitioner--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--that's
not
all
that
the
investigating
officer
said,
your
honor.
the
investigating
officer
also
said
that
the
informant
was
to
find
out
about
the
crime
from
wilson,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
have
quite
a
bit
more
breadth
to
it
than
just
finding
out
about
the
two
accomplices
which
is
all
that
the
state
mentioned.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
pardon?
mr.
philip
s.
weber
no.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
that's
true.
there's
testimony--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--but
there
is
more
to
it,
your
honor.
in
the
state
court's
hearing
record,
there
is
testimony
by
lee
that
the
investigating
officer,
whose
name
was
cullen,
asked
him
to
find
out...
and
i
believe
i'm
quoting
directly
from
that
testimony,
not
the
hearing
court's
decision
but
the
testimony...
asked
him
to
find
out
about
the
crime
from
wilson.
and
that,
as
i
said,
seems
to
have
much
greater
breadth
than
does
the
mere
inquiry
about
the
two
accomplices.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
yes,
that's
true.
and
he
was
instructed
not
to
ask
any
questions.
and
the
state
court
even
found
that
he
did
not
ask
any
questions.
but
the
catch
here
is
that
that's
not
important.
what's
important
is
that
he
was
there,
he
did
engage
in
conversation,
he
was
placed
in
proximity
to
the
accused,
he
was
a
secret
informant,
and
he
was
retained
by
the
state
for
this
purpose.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
that's
the
hypothetical--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that'...
the
hypothetical
question
that
was
left
open
by
the
court
in
henry
in
footnote
number
9.
we
call
it
the
listening
post
hypothetical,
and
this
court
hasn't
spoken
on
that.
luckily
for
wilson,
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
case
here
is
that
the
informant
provoked
wilson
by
making
comments,
by
engaging
him
in
conversation,
and
that's
all
that's
necessary
under
the
holding
of
henry
in
order
to
find
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
the
court
below
did
not
refind
the
facts
that
the
state
court
relied
on.
the
court
merely
looked
to
the
facts
and
drew
a
different
legal
conclusion
from
those
of
the
state
court.
its
conclusion
rested
on
a
different
legal
standard
that
the
state
court's,
and
is
informed,
as
the
state
court's
was
not,
by
united
states
against
henry.
accordingly,
there
are
two
particular
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
violate
the
presumption
of
section
2254(d)
when
it
rendered
its
decision
below.
first,
it
did
not
make
factual
findings
"considerably
at
odds"
with
those
of
the
state
court,
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
sumner
against
mata.
sumner
against
mata
was
quite
a
different
case
from
this
one.
there
the
issue
was
whether
the
facts
adequately
supported
the
prisoner's
contention
that
the
pretrial
identification
procedure
used
there
violated
his
right
to
due
process.
there
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
same
legal
standard
as
the
state
court
and
arrived
at
a
different
result.
here
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
different
legal
standard
to
the
facts.
the
inquiry
conducted
was
whether
the
state
deliberately
elicited
the
statement
from
the
accused
by
creating
a
situation
likely
to
induce
him
to
make
such
a
statement.
it
thus
differed
from
the
state
court
not
on
the
facts,
but
on
the
correct
legal
standard,
and
on
this
it
was
entitled
to
disagree.
the
second
reason
why
the
court
below
did
not
err,
even
though
it
did
not
cite
section
2254(d),
is
that
when
it
disagreed
with
the
state's
conclusion,
it
disagreed
with
a
conclusion
on
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
congress
2254(d)
does
not
restrict
the
power
of
the
federal
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
reach
its
own
conclusion
on
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
the
state
apparently
concedes
that
deliberate
elicitation
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
beyond
the
presumption
of
section
2254(d).
given
this,
the
court
of
appeals
was
entitled
to
reach
its
own
conclusion
about
whether
the
henry
test
was
satisfied.
this
is
especially
so
since
the
state
court
and
the
federal
courts
on
the
first
petition
did
not
have
the
henry
decision
to
guide
them.
nevertheless,
the
state
argues
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
adhered
to
the
state
court's
conclusion
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
and
here,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
state
court's
determination,
which
is
a
mixed
conclusion
of
law
and
fact,
that
the
statement
was
spontaneous
or
unsolicited
or
voluntary
are
all
in
pari
materia,
they
are
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
and
have
the
same
purpose.
indeed,
the
trial
court's
decision
really
only
had
one
finding
of
fact,
and
that
was
no
interrogation,
and
that
is
the
one
that
the
state
trial
court
considered
determinative.
the
latter,
the
voluntariness
issue,
is
a
mixed
question
of
finding
of
fact,
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
pardon
me,
and
as
to
voluntariness
this
court
has
recently
held
in
miller
against
fenton
that
it
is
a
mixed
question
and
it
is
not
subject
to
the
strictures
of
2254(d).
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
is
correct
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served,
and--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--yes.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
your
honor,
i
think
that
probably
it
would
serve
two
purposes.
i
think
that
in
the
threshold
there
certainly
is
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
discretion
was
abused,
and
that
is
always
within
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
moreover,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
review
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
the
ends
of
justice
was...
whether
the
ends
of
justice
analysis
was
in
fact
correctly
applied
in
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
correct.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
well,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
entertain
the
petition
and--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--no,
no.
well,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
law,
and
so
that
is
entertaining
the
petition
in
the
language
of
sanders
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
correct.
and
i
think,
quite
frankly,
on
that
point,
the
system,
the
habeas
corpus
system
and
the
system
created
by
sanders
and
2244(b),
worked
just
as
it's
supposed
to
in
this
case,
except
perhaps
that
the
district
court
erred
when
it
decided
to
deny
the
petition
after
entertaining
it.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statement
elicited
from
wilson
was
indeed
deliberately
elicited,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
is
a
mixed
question
on
which
it
was
entitled
to
differ
from
the
state
trial
court
after
giving
due
regard
to
the
historical
facts.
for
this
reason
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
before--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
henry
takes
in
a
result
test.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
cause
and
effect
element
that's
implicit
in
henry,
and
i
think
that
is
supported
by
maine
against
moulton.
i
think
what
the
inquiry
is
and
what
this
court's
holdings
have
been
is
that
the
court
must
examine
the
state's
conduct
and
must
determine
from
the
state's
conduct
whether
that
conduct
was
such
as
to
create
a
situation
which
has
the
foreseeability
element,
that
it
was
likely
to
induce
the
statement
from
the
prisoner,
given
all
the
facts.
and
once
there
has
been
a
determination
that
the
state
acted
in
that
way,
that
in
fact
that
leads
to
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
yes,
your
honor,
there
is--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--i
think
it
is
true
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
the
admissions
were
the
product.
i
don't
think--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--perhaps
they
can.
mr.
philip
s.
weber
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
philip
s.
weber
--well,
i
think
that
the
way
the
court,
the
state
trial
court
which
determined
wilson's
suppression
motion,
used
the
word,
it
used
it
as
essentially
a
paraphrase
or
an
equivalent
of
the
word
"voluntary".
it
meant
nothing
different.
what
it
meant
was
that
lee
did
not
interrogate
wilson
and
therefore
there
had
to
have
been
something
within
him
that
made
this
confession
burst
out.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
are
there
any
further
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
