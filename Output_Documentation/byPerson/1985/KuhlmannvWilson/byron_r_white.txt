what
about
the
purpose
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
did
the
state
deliberately
set
out
to
elicit
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about,
are
there
any
findings
anywhere
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
purpose
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
to
elicit
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
different
than
saying
the
purpose
was
to
report
to
us
if
he
says
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
you
must
show
that
what
your
client
said
was
the
result
of
conversing
with
the
informant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
henry
and
said
that
there
were
some
conversations
with
the
defendant
while
he
was
in
jail,
and
the
defendant's
incriminatory
statements
were
the
product
of
these
conversations.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you...
must
we...
you
are
asserting
that
these
admissions
were
a
product
of
the
conversations?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
be
that
and
be
spontaneous,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
spontaneity
is
a
historical
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
voluntariness
may
not
be,
but
why
isn't
spontaneity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
surely
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
different
view
of
the
record
in
that
regard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no
one
denies
that
the
informant
did
engage
in
conversations?
justice
byron
r.
white
over
several
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be.
there
may
have
been
no
questions.
but
would
you
say
that
there
wasn't
any
elicitation
if
the
informant
said,
i've
been
listening
to
you
and,
look,
fellow,
you
ought
to
go
and
confess?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's...
you're
going
to
be
much
better
off
if
you
just
confess.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
he
thought
it
over
and
the
next
day
he
called
in
the
policeman.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
he
say
in
this
instance?
he
says,
look,
mister,
you
ought
to
come
up
with
a
better
story
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
immediately
after
the
informant
said
that
to
him
he
said,
well,
i
guess
i
will,
i
guess
i'll...
and
then
he
really
told
him
something.
