justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
concede
that
it
is
open
to
this
court
to
give
substance
and
meaning
to
the
situations
that
this
court
thinks
are
appropriate
for
federal
courts
in
entertaining
petitions
from
state
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
were
to
think
that
henry
didn't
articulate
new
legal
principles,
but
simply
applied
the
same
legal
principles
previously
established
to
new
facts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
there
should
be
no
limit,
then,
on
when
courts
will
consider
the
same
issue
again
and
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
the
evidence
of
the
legislative
history
then
is
entirely
free
from
an
indication
that
congress
thought
there
should
be
some
limit
someplace?
